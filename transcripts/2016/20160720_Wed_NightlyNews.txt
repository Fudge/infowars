[00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:22.343]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.443 --> 00:00:23.744]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:27.926]  It is July 20th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.588 --> 00:00:39.293]  Tonight, U.S.-backed Syrian rebels behead a 10-year-old boy by mistake.
[00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:44.776]  Meanwhile, the Pentagon-trained rebels pledge their allegiance to ISIS.
[00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:52.874]  Then, desperate liberals are now blaming Matt Drudge for the rise of Donald Trump.
[00:00:57.097 --> 00:01:03.781]  Plus, a Benghazi survivor says there will be mutiny if Hillary Clinton steals the election.
[00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:04.662]  You're not giving orders anymore.
[00:01:04.942 --> 00:01:05.662]  You're in my will now.
[00:01:05.843 --> 00:01:08.985]  We have 36 American lives to save.
[00:01:10.652 --> 00:01:15.178]  All that plus another busy day for the InfoWars crew at the RNC.
[00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.023]  That's up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:02.377]  Hi, I'm Dr. David Jones.
[00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:05.420]  I've been in practice for over 30 years in dentistry.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.444]  In our health histories, we've always asked what people's primary complaint were.
[00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:12.006]  A third of the time, it's, I want whiter teeth.
[00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:26.279]  In the early days of dentistry, we used some fairly harsh chemicals in order to bleach the teeth and whiten them, and people were happy with the results, even though it created hypersensitivity and some problems that I consider fairly high risk.
[00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.901]  Recently, I was exposed to the Ghost Smile System.
[00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:36.324]  It allows a whitening gel to be applied to the teeth with a very good ultrasonic toothbrush system.
[00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:51.691]  The gel is activated by a light-emitting diode, or actually two light-emitting diodes, so it's a simple and elegant procedure that delivers office-quality whitening, and you don't have to spend the $600 it typically costs for an in-office treatment.
[00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:55.815]  In my opinion, it's the most elegant and best value that I've ever seen.
[00:02:56.015 --> 00:02:59.780]  To get your GoSmile system, go to InfowarsStore.com.
[00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:17.767]  Now tell me this, how do you accidentally chop off somebody's head?
[00:03:18.128 --> 00:03:22.951]  Let alone the head of a little boy, and that is what's being reported by CNN.
[00:03:23.391 --> 00:03:26.473]  Rebels boy beheaded in Syria, a mistake.
[00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:30.256]  And they say the beheading could affect US support of the rebels.
[00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:42.905]  The rebels claim the boy was a prisoner from a pro-regime militia force, made up mostly of Palestinians in Syria, and that he was captured from an unofficial refugee camp north of the war-torn Aleppo.
[00:03:43.605 --> 00:03:46.686]  The footage then shows one of the men taking a knife to the child's head.
[00:03:47.186 --> 00:03:54.069]  The boy appears to be quite young, perhaps around 10, although CNN cannot confirm or verify the boy's age or identity.
[00:03:54.869 --> 00:04:00.231]  In a statement posted on their Facebook page, the rebel group involved called the killing an individual mistake.
[00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:06.156]  And that it would investigate the human rights abuses that were shared on social media sites.
[00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:06.658]  So...
[00:04:07.978 --> 00:04:13.520]  When I heard this story, when I read this headline, I was thinking a mistake.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.023]  Maybe this young man, or this little boy, let's call him what he is, lost his head in some type of shrapnel incident.
[00:04:20.063 --> 00:04:23.304]  Maybe there was an explosion and the shrapnel came and it cut his head off.
[00:04:23.324 --> 00:04:25.765]  And I'm not trying to joke here, I'm being very serious here.
[00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:31.568]  How do you accidentally cut off a little boy's head from their own admission in this article by CNN?
[00:04:32.868 --> 00:04:33.308]  I think so.
[00:04:53.274 --> 00:04:55.855]  A rebel group decided to cut off this little boy's head.
[00:04:56.455 --> 00:05:03.098]  And to say how much of this is not a mistake, this was a very intentional action and it's been going on for quite some time.
[00:05:03.418 --> 00:05:08.660]  It's making the news now because it's a high profile case of a little boy suffering these consequences.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:17.123]  But these Syrian rebels, most of whom aren't even Syrian, we've been documenting this for at least the four years that I've been here, have been caught doing numerous
[00:05:17.643 --> 00:05:28.250]  I'm not saying that they're the only ones, and I'm not saying that Assad's an angel by any stretch of the imagination, but the Syrian rebels, a group that we back, have a long history of doing this.
[00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.232]  And to show you that, I just have a small sampling of articles here.
[00:05:32.252 --> 00:05:33.473]  Let's start with this one.
[00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:38.076]  UN designates Free Syrian Army affiliates of Al-Qaeda.
[00:05:39.241 --> 00:05:50.303]  The Libyan Islamic fighting group currently arming, funding, and commanding brigades of the so-called Free Syrian Army is designated an Al-Qaeda affiliate by the United Nations.
[00:05:50.643 --> 00:05:53.183]  Now, do I agree with everything the United Nations does and says?
[00:05:53.343 --> 00:05:53.963]  Absolutely not.
[00:05:54.504 --> 00:06:04.665]  But even the United Nations can see clear as day that the Free Syrian Army, aka the Syrian rebels, are nothing more than an Al-Qaeda group in the act as such.
[00:06:05.065 --> 00:06:06.205]  And that's not the only one.
[00:06:06.306 --> 00:06:08.486]  Let's take a look at this one a few years back.
[00:06:09.346 --> 00:06:13.808]  Syrian rebels commander, yes, we're still collaborating with ISIS.
[00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:25.954]  Speaking with Lebanon's Daily Star, Basil Idris, commander of an FSA-run rebels brigade, openly discussed the group's joint operations with ISIS in the al-Nusra Front.
[00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:32.883]  We are collaborating with the Islamic State and the Nusra Front by attacking the Syrian Army's gathering.
[00:06:32.983 --> 00:06:37.326]  Once again, you have these terrorist organizations being funded by the West.
[00:06:37.346 --> 00:06:39.467]  We have long documentation of that.
[00:06:40.128 --> 00:06:42.649]  They chop off a little boy's head and they say it was an accident.
[00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:46.332]  It was, what's the quote here, an individual error to be investigated.
[00:06:46.352 --> 00:06:49.514]  Why they thought it was necessary to chop off the head of a little boy.
[00:06:50.054 --> 00:06:50.755]  We'll continue here.
[00:06:51.195 --> 00:06:56.699]  Pentagon-trained rebel group in Syria pledges allegiance to ISIS-aligned al-Nusra.
[00:06:57.499 --> 00:07:10.184]  Division 30, also known as the New Syrian Forces, was created by the United States as part of a propaganda campaign to counter the fact virtually all of the mercenaries in Syria have gone over to the Islamic State.
[00:07:10.544 --> 00:07:19.328]  But once again, even though these guys are singing songs about Osama Bin Laden, how great he is, and all the other war crimes we've documented here, it was a mistake.
[00:07:19.368 --> 00:07:21.048]  They chopped off this little boy's head.
[00:07:21.549 --> 00:07:24.750]  We've got one more here talking about Senator John McCain.
[00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.312]  The guy who just loves war and he wants to criticize you if you don't know who you're talking about.
[00:07:29.692 --> 00:07:31.253]  And we have this article from a couple years ago.
[00:07:31.733 --> 00:07:36.296]  Angry McCain admits meeting with ISIS scolds Rand Paul for not knowing terrorists.
[00:07:36.616 --> 00:07:37.557]  This is a quote from McCain.
[00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:39.998]  Has Rand Paul ever been to Syria?
[00:07:40.338 --> 00:07:41.479]  Has he ever met with ISIS?
[00:07:42.119 --> 00:07:44.100]  Has he ever met with any of these people?
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.520]  No, no, no.
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:56.163]  McCain said, clearly in reference to his own visit to Syria in 2013, where he was photographed with leaders of the Free Syrian Army, the fighters violently opposed to the Assad regime.
[00:07:56.203 --> 00:07:58.023]  Now, let's show this picture of McCain here.
[00:07:58.383 --> 00:08:04.885]  Now, in this picture, these are several guys who have done the war atrocities that we've been documenting for several years.
[00:08:05.225 --> 00:08:09.769]  And McCain, he's over there, he's, you know, shaking hands and kissing babies and hanging out with known terrorists.
[00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:14.314]  And then he wants to come back to the state side and criticize Rand Paul for not knowing who these people are.
[00:08:14.534 --> 00:08:17.077]  Yes, Senator McCain, I'm sure you do know who these people are.
[00:08:17.297 --> 00:08:20.700]  You've been arming them and funding them and wanting more aid to go to them.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.003]  Meanwhile, they're doing all these atrocities, including chopping off a little boy's head.
[00:08:24.283 --> 00:08:25.765]  And that's just what happened here recently.
[00:08:26.085 --> 00:08:27.487]  You can go back to the archives.
[00:08:27.987 --> 00:08:40.133]  Whether it's here or someplace else, and see the numerous crimes these guys have done, whether it's burning down Christian villages, or shooting priests, or any number of things going on for a very long time, but it's just now making the news.
[00:08:40.193 --> 00:08:49.958]  But when it does make the news cycle, CNN is just going to say it's a mistake, it was a, one last time, it was a quote, individual error, according to CNN, that this little boy lost his head.
[00:08:50.558 --> 00:08:54.360]  Now let's move on to some other news, and lighten up the mood here a little bit.
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.883]  Let's talk about the Republican National Convention and the things that are going on out there.
[00:08:58.983 --> 00:09:02.366]  Now, if you haven't seen the video, there's been a whole lot of stuff going on.
[00:09:02.386 --> 00:09:03.567]  A lot of big interviews.
[00:09:03.607 --> 00:09:09.872]  The guys they had a chance to talk to, Dinesh D'Souza and Nigel Farage and many other celebrities out there as well.
[00:09:09.932 --> 00:09:11.393]  Ted Nugent was on the show today.
[00:09:11.914 --> 00:09:14.056]  Alex had a bit of a scuffle out there yesterday.
[00:09:14.456 --> 00:09:17.218]  But we're talking about something a little bit different, and this is Breitbart.
[00:09:19.002 --> 00:09:20.262]  They're talking about The Daily Show.
[00:09:20.322 --> 00:09:24.924]  Now, personally, I have never seen a full episode of The Daily Show.
[00:09:25.004 --> 00:09:25.944]  I can honestly say that.
[00:09:26.284 --> 00:09:27.944]  I've seen snippets of it here and there.
[00:09:28.685 --> 00:09:31.785]  You know, when they make it around the news cycle, hey, watch this funny clip of The Daily Show.
[00:09:31.825 --> 00:09:32.586]  I may watch some of that.
[00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:36.927]  I've never seen a full episode, whether with the new guy or with Jon Stewart.
[00:09:37.347 --> 00:09:39.327]  So I don't know how they edit their videos.
[00:09:39.607 --> 00:09:41.588]  Many people are saying that they selectively edit them.
[00:09:42.088 --> 00:09:42.528]  I don't know.
[00:09:42.608 --> 00:09:45.449]  But here's a clip where this is the Breitbart News
[00:09:46.149 --> 00:09:50.414]  Editor Joe Pollak, he had a chat with the Daily Show about their editing process.
[00:10:01.545 --> 00:10:02.927]  I'm totally entitled to do that.
[00:10:03.127 --> 00:10:04.609]  You're here for our event.
[00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:09.014]  Sir, we're completely honest with where we're from and what we're doing.
[00:10:09.034 --> 00:10:10.696]  But you're not honest with the people you interview, are you?
[00:10:11.076 --> 00:10:12.298]  You splice and dice.
[00:10:12.618 --> 00:10:14.741]  This has been said many times and I've seen it happen.
[00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:16.343]  You edit to make people look stupid.
[00:10:16.383 --> 00:10:17.664]  It's not your responsibility.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:39.545]  And that was the reaction, because I run into people sometimes, and if I have a street interview with somebody, I usually prefer to record it, whether I just have an iPhone in my pocket, or I've gone on the street with Biggs when he's talked to other news agencies, and we always record it, just in case, for whatever reason, there's some creative edit later on.
[00:10:39.585 --> 00:10:43.046]  We have the account of what actually happened, and they were doing a similar thing here.
[00:10:43.786 --> 00:10:48.648]  You can argue whether they're being abrasive or not, either side, but that's what that situation was.
[00:10:49.108 --> 00:10:55.751]  Now, let's talk about something near and dear to my heart, and that is the Second Amendment here in the United States of America, and that is the right to bear arms.
[00:10:55.811 --> 00:10:58.212]  Now, arm is not restricted to a firearm.
[00:10:58.252 --> 00:11:01.093]  That's what a lot of people assume it is, or they try to water it down.
[00:11:01.413 --> 00:11:05.795]  You have to understand back at the time that the Second Amendment was written, everybody's like, it's about muskets.
[00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:11.202]  Arm is an arm, whether it was a bow and arrow at the time, or a crossbow, or a sword, or whatever else.
[00:11:11.523 --> 00:11:13.425]  And that continues with the weapons here today.
[00:11:13.826 --> 00:11:19.714]  And now we see that the Massachusetts Attorney General is moving to ban sales of copyright assault weapons.
[00:11:20.095 --> 00:11:21.777]  And this is Attorney General Healey.
[00:11:22.318 --> 00:11:41.217]  Keely announced that her office was ratcheting up enforcement of the state's assault weapon ban by targeting guns whose actions are similar to AR-15s and AK-47s but meet current cosmetic requirements such as being sold without features like a splash suppressor, bayonet lug, or telescoping stock.
[00:11:41.257 --> 00:11:43.600]  Now let's take a second right here and pause.
[00:11:45.011 --> 00:11:54.999]  Do any of these provisions that I just mentioned, whether it's a flash suppressor, bayonet lug, or telescoping stock, that doesn't really make the gun shoot any faster?
[00:11:55.079 --> 00:11:58.342]  Because that's what the notion is, I guess, in the assault weapons band.
[00:11:58.362 --> 00:12:00.283]  You don't want a fully automatic rifle.
[00:12:00.964 --> 00:12:09.071]  Having a bayonet lug, when's the last time you've heard a story here in the United States of America of somebody being stabbed with a bayonet that's affixed to the end of an AK-47 or AR-15?
[00:12:09.091 --> 00:12:09.391]  I don't know.
[00:12:12.813 --> 00:12:13.914]  One off the top of my head.
[00:12:14.254 --> 00:12:19.716]  Also, the stock, all that is, is it moves the butt of the gun back and forth.
[00:12:19.736 --> 00:12:21.857]  So let's say if you have longer arms, you can extend it out.
[00:12:21.897 --> 00:12:24.038]  It doesn't make your gun shoot any faster.
[00:12:24.078 --> 00:12:28.660]  So they're banning truly cosmetic features of your gun.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.080]  It's like having spinning rims on your car.
[00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:34.682]  The spinning rims don't make the car go any faster, it just makes it look different.
[00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:36.983]  But we'll go down here to the quote of Healy.
[00:12:37.563 --> 00:12:39.144]  And she said, this will end now.
[00:12:39.344 --> 00:12:41.465]  And this is an editorial piece for the Boston Globe.
[00:12:42.025 --> 00:12:50.708]  On Wednesday, we are sending a directive to all gun manufacturers and dealers that makes clear that the sale of these copycat assault weapons is illegal in Massachusetts.
[00:12:51.128 --> 00:12:57.831]  With this directive, we will ensure that we get full protection intended when lawmakers enact our assault weapons ban.
[00:12:58.131 --> 00:12:59.972]  Assault weapons ban!
[00:13:00.552 --> 00:13:01.853]  Nobody's trying to take your guns.
[00:13:01.913 --> 00:13:02.713]  Nobody wants your guns.
[00:13:02.733 --> 00:13:03.554]  Nobody's trying to take your guns.
[00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:07.437]  Assault... Can you guys put... I want everybody to zoom in on that.
[00:13:07.517 --> 00:13:08.617]  Make sure everybody gets that.
[00:13:08.637 --> 00:13:09.238]  This is a quote.
[00:13:09.738 --> 00:13:11.339]  Assault weapons, bam.
[00:13:11.619 --> 00:13:13.320]  Her words, not mine.
[00:13:13.741 --> 00:13:15.082]  And not the watered down version.
[00:13:15.802 --> 00:13:16.162]  We're good to go.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.401]  We're good to go.
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.946]  And that's why I said they're banning guns on cosmetic features just like in New York, the New York Safe Act.
[00:13:55.286 --> 00:13:55.907]  Similar things.
[00:13:55.927 --> 00:13:57.930]  They're talking about the stock on your gun.
[00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:01.615]  Things that have nothing to do with your gun shooting faster or slower.
[00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:04.759]  It's just a cosmetic entity to the gun.
[00:14:04.839 --> 00:14:07.763]  Nothing to do with fully automatic or anything else at all.
[00:14:08.564 --> 00:14:09.224]  We're good to go.
[00:14:30.379 --> 00:14:31.760]  Alternative media in general.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:40.484]  Because over the past few years, I guess decade or so, Drudge has been a huge news aggregate, pushing a lot of good information out there.
[00:14:40.524 --> 00:14:44.266]  But now they're attacking Drudge and they're doing everything they can to pull down Donald Trump.
[00:14:44.586 --> 00:14:47.228]  And if they had to pull down Matt Drudge to do that, they will do that.
[00:14:47.668 --> 00:14:51.250]  And we see desperate liberals blame Drudge for Trump's rise.
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:15:06.450]  In a recent Business Insider article, link aggregator DrudgeReport.com is accused of aiding the businessman's rise to power by rewarding conservative media publications who cover Trump in a positive light with website traffic.
[00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.531]  Now let's stop right there.
[00:15:08.011 --> 00:15:09.612]  Are there pro-Trump websites?
[00:15:09.652 --> 00:15:09.913]  Yes.
[00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:11.754]  Are there pro-Hillary websites?
[00:15:12.034 --> 00:15:12.934]  Yes, I'll name some.
[00:15:12.994 --> 00:15:15.456]  CBS, CNN, MSNBC.
[00:15:15.716 --> 00:15:21.278]  Those are what you would call pro-Hillary websites, or at least pro-Democratic websites.
[00:15:21.298 --> 00:15:27.641]  So to go after Drudge for doing this, but to turn a blind eye to these other news organizations is highly hypocritical.
[00:15:28.142 --> 00:15:33.064]  Tossing Trump's considerable mastery of the press aside, Drudge is painted as a kingmaker.
[00:15:33.424 --> 00:15:33.844]  We're good.
[00:15:54.509 --> 00:16:00.154]  And doing that, as far as I'm concerned, I think Drudge, if Trump does something good, he says Trump did something good.
[00:16:00.174 --> 00:16:02.075]  If Trump does something bad, he did something bad.
[00:16:02.115 --> 00:16:03.697]  Just like with the Mike Pence situation.
[00:16:03.717 --> 00:16:05.558]  A lot of people on the fence with that.
[00:16:05.638 --> 00:16:07.960]  And he didn't bury the fact that he picked Mike Pence.
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:13.825]  He put it right up there at the top of the Drudge report with a big red link saying Mike Pence's pick.
[00:16:13.885 --> 00:16:16.607]  And many people had many negative things to say about that.
[00:16:16.667 --> 00:16:20.630]  Not about the article about Drudge, but just the fact that he picked Mike Pence.
[00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.392]  So I think that's a very silly
[00:16:23.092 --> 00:16:24.673]  Way to view Matt Drudge.
[00:16:24.993 --> 00:16:31.958]  Let's talk about another journalist and this is a prominent journalist that was killed in an apparent car bomb assassination and this was in Kiev.
[00:16:32.579 --> 00:16:44.307]  The country's top online news website said its journalist died in an explosion early on Wednesday as he got into his car to drive to work to anchor a talk show on a local radio station.
[00:16:44.727 --> 00:16:47.909]  The publication said the car was owned by its editor-in-chief.
[00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.851]  Now when it comes to journalists, you know, I'm
[00:16:51.078 --> 00:16:53.919]  Very sensitive when people, you know, die in this type of situation.
[00:16:53.959 --> 00:16:58.200]  Because even if I don't agree with somebody's politics, it could be somebody who's like, my bizarro.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.481]  They're, you know, they're anti-gun, they're pro-abortion, and on and on and on.
[00:17:03.101 --> 00:17:09.083]  If that person truly believes in what they're doing, regardless if I agree with them, I don't want to see harm come to them.
[00:17:09.343 --> 00:17:12.723]  Because at the end of the day, they're doing what they think is right, just like I'm doing what I think is right.
[00:17:12.843 --> 00:17:15.244]  So I can respect that, even if I don't agree with that.
[00:17:15.264 --> 00:17:18.285]  And the same thing, what I've seen a couple years ago, the guy,
[00:17:18.945 --> 00:17:22.667]  Reporters without borders got killed and people were throwing mud on him, like, oh, he deserved it.
[00:17:22.727 --> 00:17:26.009]  I'm like, no, the guy was doing what he thought was right, and I can respect that.
[00:17:26.049 --> 00:17:32.213]  So it's very sad to see this type of harm come to journalists, especially in this free and open society, supposedly.
[00:17:32.693 --> 00:17:33.514]  And we'll end with this.
[00:17:33.754 --> 00:17:48.343]  I saw an op-ed piece today, I think it was on Drudge Report, or Drudge, link to it, it was an LA Times piece, saying that the government or the military was basically going to have to revolt against Trump if he gets elected, and it goes to all this scenario, and could happen, sensationalism, all that.
[00:17:48.743 --> 00:17:56.088]  And that's one way to look at it, but we also have a Benghazi survivor saying that special operators will leave the military if Clinton gets elected.
[00:17:56.429 --> 00:18:01.672]  So you can pick your poison, you want Trump, you want Hillary, I personally don't want either of them, but you're welcome to your opinion.
[00:18:01.712 --> 00:18:04.534]  We'll be back right after this break with more special reports.
[00:18:05.455 --> 00:18:08.357]  Are we at risk of losing some of our special operators, some of our best guys?
[00:18:08.637 --> 00:18:09.138]  We already are.
[00:18:09.678 --> 00:18:09.918]  Really?
[00:18:10.018 --> 00:18:14.942]  There's guys leaving now just because of that, because they don't know if the call for help is going to be heard.
[00:18:15.965 --> 00:18:20.268]  This council has no hesitation in proclaiming you all guilty.
[00:18:20.288 --> 00:18:22.629]  Guilty.
[00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:23.030]  Guilty.
[00:18:25.551 --> 00:18:25.852]  Guilty.
[00:18:26.012 --> 00:18:27.373]  Or not, uh...
[00:18:53.752 --> 00:18:54.813]  Come on down before me, Jor-El!
[00:18:54.853 --> 00:19:01.696]  Hope you end up one day, Jor-El!
[00:19:09.189 --> 00:19:10.170]  They're all over the country.
[00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:11.431]  It's one of the top memes in the nation.
[00:19:11.691 --> 00:19:15.693]  But at $19.95, we can take all the proceeds and pay for aircraft from the skies.
[00:19:15.974 --> 00:19:17.375]  You've seen that be national news.
[00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:18.996]  You've seen that be the top meme in the country.
[00:19:19.036 --> 00:19:19.516]  It's amazing.
[00:19:20.056 --> 00:19:21.938]  We're leading the way on how to resist.
[00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:23.459]  We're ragtag.
[00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:25.580]  We're cross-eyed and exhausted half the time.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.841]  But we've got the passion.
[00:19:26.861 --> 00:19:27.722]  We're going over the top.
[00:19:28.122 --> 00:19:30.944]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[00:19:31.184 --> 00:19:38.948]  I'm selling at $19.95 to pay for the banners, to pay for the 18-wheelers with the big signs, to pay for the Jumbotron videos, and it's really paying off.
[00:19:38.968 --> 00:19:40.969]  Hundreds of newspapers, TV, Hillary for President.
[00:19:41.569 --> 00:19:45.131]  You cannot, but all the shirts we sell, all the ones we have, it's like $60,000.
[00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:47.752]  So, but we got more being printed right now.
[00:19:47.792 --> 00:19:55.756]  Everybody's got to go buy a Hillary for President shirt for $19.95, show that in full or so you can get on the whole, because I want to really go crazy with airplanes at the DNC.
[00:19:56.096 --> 00:19:57.257]  We're looking at blimps as well.
[00:19:57.677 --> 00:19:58.578]  We're not going to be censored.
[00:19:58.659 --> 00:19:59.820]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.322]  Get your Hillary for President shirts today.
[00:20:01.683 --> 00:20:03.886]  Look in the last eight months how far that meme's come.
[00:20:04.167 --> 00:20:08.293]  In one block that I walked just a minute ago, I saw 15 of those shirts.
[00:20:08.713 --> 00:20:09.735]  Just in one block!
[00:20:10.276 --> 00:20:12.659]  They drive here from my spot where I'm staying.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.001]  30, 40 tons of them.
[00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:17.383]  They're every single winner.
[00:20:17.403 --> 00:20:22.326]  The rally yesterday, almost everyone in the crowd had on a Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[00:20:22.486 --> 00:20:23.647]  It is amazing.
[00:20:24.367 --> 00:20:27.049]  Everyone stops and they go, what does that shirt mean?
[00:20:27.109 --> 00:20:27.409]  Why?
[00:20:27.489 --> 00:20:28.830]  Why does she need to go to prison?
[00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:35.314]  And it allows us to engage in a conversation and teach these people who have no clue about who Hillary really is.
[00:20:35.874 --> 00:20:37.596]  About all the things she's been involved in.
[00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:38.857]  And we're not laying down to that witch.
[00:20:38.897 --> 00:20:40.418]  She's not, she's not going to buffalo us.
[00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:41.419]  We're not coward.
[00:20:41.439 --> 00:20:42.220]  We're not broke back.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:42.981]  We're taking action.
[00:20:43.001 --> 00:20:43.501]  What about you?
[00:20:43.802 --> 00:20:44.722]  Get your Hillary for President shirt.
[00:20:44.762 --> 00:20:45.483]  I know you already have one.
[00:20:45.503 --> 00:20:45.944]  Buy another one.
[00:20:46.184 --> 00:20:47.125]  Give it to friends and family.
[00:20:47.465 --> 00:20:50.248]  I'm telling you, the war is now, the war is an info war.
[00:20:50.488 --> 00:20:51.068]  We're going to win.
[00:20:51.569 --> 00:20:54.291]  It's now been duplicated by countless groups and I think that's wonderful.
[00:20:55.273 --> 00:21:02.196]  Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and now it's all over CNN, it's all over Fox, it's all over the Trump rallies, the Hillary rallies.
[00:21:02.556 --> 00:21:09.618]  The number one search term for a week straight, last week, and still continuing, one of the top search terms is, is Hillary going to jail?
[00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:12.059]  This has been incredibly successful.
[00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:16.701]  Because it shows, despite corporate control, and despite them trying to control the meme,
[00:21:17.341 --> 00:21:19.663]  We've had three versions of the Hillary for Prison shirt.
[00:21:20.183 --> 00:21:23.606]  All of them have been collector's edition and have helped fund the InfoWar.
[00:21:24.186 --> 00:21:26.748]  We now have a third edition in.
[00:21:26.989 --> 00:21:28.310]  The second edition sold out.
[00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:45.223]  It's the same as the last, but on the right shoulder says InfoWars.com, on the back it says InfoWars.com, legalized freedom, be part of history, be part of supporting the InfoWar, be part of meeting like-minded friends and family.
[00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:53.975]  Get your Hillary for Prison 2016 3rd Wave Shirts at InfoWarStore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:01.394 --> 00:22:01.874]  Not a group.
[00:22:01.914 --> 00:22:03.314]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:22:03.354 --> 00:22:04.435]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:22:04.695 --> 00:22:05.615]  Why is this so good?
[00:22:05.895 --> 00:22:11.136]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:22:11.216 --> 00:22:24.780]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.200]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.581]  Spreading disease around.
[00:22:28.642 --> 00:22:31.124]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:22:31.224 --> 00:22:32.485]  These are all parasites.
[00:22:32.525 --> 00:22:33.646]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:34.687]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:22:34.987 --> 00:22:39.330]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:22:39.531 --> 00:22:42.693]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:22:42.713 --> 00:22:45.876]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:22:45.916 --> 00:22:46.917]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:22:46.957 --> 00:22:47.477]  Living Defense.
[00:22:47.777 --> 00:22:48.838]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:22:48.898 --> 00:22:49.919]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:22:49.939 --> 00:22:51.961]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:22:53.522 --> 00:22:54.505]  You support the broadcast.
[00:22:54.565 --> 00:22:55.647]  Infowarslives.com.
[00:22:55.908 --> 00:22:57.812]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:22:58.173 --> 00:23:00.157]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:23:18.251 --> 00:23:18.812]  Back up!
[00:23:18.872 --> 00:23:20.954]  Back up!
[00:23:21.074 --> 00:23:23.457]  Back up!
[00:23:23.477 --> 00:23:23.457]  1, 2, 3, 4!
[00:23:24.518 --> 00:23:28.143]  Slavery, genocide, and war!
[00:23:28.163 --> 00:23:28.143]  5, 6, 7, 8!
[00:23:28.523 --> 00:23:32.147]  America was never free!
[00:23:32.167 --> 00:23:32.147]  1, 2, 3, 4!
[00:23:32.668 --> 00:23:34.370]  Slavery, genocide, and war!
[00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:40.054]  We're here today to stand with the people of the world!
[00:23:40.074 --> 00:23:45.178]  We're taking a stand against this imperialist Republican National Convention!
[00:23:45.558 --> 00:23:47.519]  Donald Trump is an open fashion!
[00:23:47.679 --> 00:23:49.781]  Hillary Clinton is a proven war criminal!
[00:23:49.881 --> 00:23:53.323]  We're not following either one of those leaders.
[00:23:53.343 --> 00:24:04.211]  Donald Trump's message of America First is a fascist message of control over the people of the world, to wage an unending war, to exploit people all over the planet.
[00:24:04.291 --> 00:24:15.459]  America, number one, America first, and always has been first, at genocide, at slavery, of exploitation, of torture, of coup d'etat, of invasion,
[00:24:15.979 --> 00:24:20.081]  We're standing here with the people of the world today.
[00:24:20.101 --> 00:24:23.483]  We're standing here with the people of the world today.
[00:24:23.523 --> 00:24:25.144]  No Trump's an American person.
[00:24:25.204 --> 00:24:25.744]  Back up.
[00:24:25.804 --> 00:24:26.404]  Back up.
[00:24:26.424 --> 00:24:27.105]  Back up.
[00:24:27.145 --> 00:24:27.545]  Back up.
[00:24:27.585 --> 00:24:28.485]  Back up the steps.
[00:24:28.705 --> 00:24:29.826]  Back up the steps.
[00:24:29.886 --> 00:24:30.566]  Back up.
[00:24:30.626 --> 00:24:32.327]  Back up the steps.
[00:24:32.507 --> 00:24:34.348]  You gotta go back.
[00:24:34.388 --> 00:24:34.809]  Back up.
[00:24:34.849 --> 00:24:35.589]  You gotta back up.
[00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:37.410]  Back up.
[00:24:39.363 --> 00:24:40.144]  Okay, step back!
[00:24:40.204 --> 00:24:40.584]  Step back!
[00:24:40.624 --> 00:24:41.305]  Step back!
[00:24:41.325 --> 00:24:41.725]  Move back!
[00:24:41.745 --> 00:24:42.206]  Move back!
[00:24:42.246 --> 00:24:43.166]  You're on fire!
[00:24:43.226 --> 00:24:43.727]  You're on fire!
[00:24:43.787 --> 00:24:44.588]  You're on fire!
[00:24:44.648 --> 00:24:45.108]  You stupid!
[00:25:05.686 --> 00:25:05.966]  Back off!
[00:25:06.006 --> 00:25:06.266]  Back off!
[00:25:06.306 --> 00:25:06.706]  Back off!
[00:25:06.726 --> 00:25:06.926]  Back off!
[00:25:06.946 --> 00:25:07.226]  Back off!
[00:25:07.246 --> 00:25:07.426]  Back off!
[00:25:32.312 --> 00:25:32.932]  Leave the country then!
[00:25:58.848 --> 00:25:59.208]  We're good to go.
[00:26:35.145 --> 00:26:35.405]  Move back!
[00:26:35.425 --> 00:26:35.625]  Move back!
[00:26:35.645 --> 00:26:35.825]  Move back!
[00:26:35.845 --> 00:26:36.045]  Move back!
[00:26:36.065 --> 00:26:36.266]  Move back!
[00:26:36.286 --> 00:26:36.626]  Move back!
[00:26:36.646 --> 00:26:36.826]  Move back!
[00:26:36.846 --> 00:26:37.026]  Move back!
[00:26:37.046 --> 00:26:37.226]  Move back!
[00:26:37.246 --> 00:26:37.506]  Move back!
[00:27:02.858 --> 00:27:04.019]  Watch out behind you!
[00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:04.680]  Watch out behind you!
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:05.360]  Watch out behind you!
[00:27:24.124 --> 00:27:25.545]  Let's keep it cool, people.
[00:27:25.705 --> 00:27:26.526]  It's a hot day.
[00:27:26.566 --> 00:27:28.687]  Keep it cool, okay?
[00:27:28.867 --> 00:27:32.870]  All you mean people, don't be rushing in all the time.
[00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.011]  You're causing problems to those people.
[00:27:42.443 --> 00:27:43.024]  Back up!
[00:27:43.044 --> 00:27:43.244]  Back up!
[00:27:43.284 --> 00:27:43.624]  Back up!
[00:27:43.644 --> 00:27:43.864]  Back up!
[00:28:11.544 --> 00:28:11.824]  Yeah, I get it.
[00:28:11.844 --> 00:28:12.004]  I get it.
[00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:49.871]  Rob doing Infowars.com.
[00:28:49.911 --> 00:28:51.472]  Looks like the police have cordoned off the area.
[00:28:51.552 --> 00:28:53.553]  Looks like they might be making arrests or something's going on.
[00:29:19.541 --> 00:29:23.442]  I saw two people get dragged out.
[00:29:23.702 --> 00:29:24.643]  I saw two.
[00:29:24.883 --> 00:29:28.004]  I saw two get dragged out.
[00:29:46.288 --> 00:29:46.648]  We're good.
[00:29:46.668 --> 00:29:47.229]  We're good to go.
[00:29:47.249 --> 00:29:49.310]  There was somebody I talked to who was saying that she was there.
[00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:50.490]  Yeah, that's what she said.
[00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:51.231]  She was right over there.
[00:30:05.694 --> 00:30:08.035]  I know, I'm getting up against the fence!
[00:30:08.055 --> 00:30:09.536]  Dude, right here, alright?
[00:30:09.596 --> 00:30:10.436]  Get out that way!
[00:30:10.456 --> 00:30:11.717]  Get out that way!
[00:30:11.837 --> 00:30:13.418]  Keep this area clear!
[00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:15.659]  Keep this area clear!
[00:30:15.859 --> 00:30:16.419]  Out that way!
[00:30:38.757 --> 00:30:40.058]  Be gentle, officers.
[00:30:40.098 --> 00:30:41.778]  Please be gentle.
[00:30:41.818 --> 00:30:42.399]  Thank you.
[00:30:42.499 --> 00:30:43.659]  Okay, let's take it easy.
[00:30:43.699 --> 00:30:47.320]  Officers have not been pushed too hard.
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:47.540]  No!
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.021]  No!
[00:30:48.121 --> 00:30:48.201]  No!
[00:31:11.627 --> 00:31:17.615]  Okay, let's take it easy people.
[00:31:17.795 --> 00:31:22.161]  Come on, let's just let it go.
[00:31:22.762 --> 00:31:26.387]  Come on, let's let it go people.
[00:31:27.348 --> 00:31:33.475]  Let's be gentle officers, let's be gentle.
[00:31:33.595 --> 00:31:36.198]  Minimal use of force.
[00:31:36.218 --> 00:31:38.681]  Come on, get on this side.
[00:31:43.486 --> 00:31:44.206]  Let's take it easy.
[00:32:10.077 --> 00:32:10.217]  Yeah.
[00:32:10.237 --> 00:32:10.357]  Yeah.
[00:32:42.482 --> 00:32:44.909]  Who are we?
[00:33:02.526 --> 00:33:07.990]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.031]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.431 --> 00:33:12.493]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[00:33:13.174 --> 00:33:13.634]  30 servings.
[00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:16.436]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[00:33:16.736 --> 00:33:17.797]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.857 --> 00:33:18.818]  Infowarslife.com
[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.346]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!

[00:36:00.442 --> 00:36:01.983]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.686]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.026 --> 00:36:46.687]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.

[00:37:03.873 --> 00:37:06.496]  Ashley Beckford here with Infowars.com.
[00:37:06.836 --> 00:37:20.170]  I'm on the University of Texas campus at the Barbara Jordan statue to talk about liberty, to talk about America, and to ask people what they think about Mila Yiannopoulos' Twitter account being suspended permanently.
[00:37:20.683 --> 00:37:23.585]  So, are you familiar with who Milo Yiannopoulos is?
[00:37:23.965 --> 00:37:25.065]  Uh, yes, I know who he is.
[00:37:25.085 --> 00:37:28.427]  Okay, did you hear that he was permanently banned off Twitter last night?
[00:37:28.807 --> 00:37:29.288]  Yes, I did.
[00:37:29.568 --> 00:37:31.169]  Okay, and so how do you feel about that?
[00:37:31.209 --> 00:37:32.389]  That's what I'm trying to find out.
[00:37:32.409 --> 00:37:36.371]  Uh, well, I don't know all the facts of the story, but what I heard is that, um...
[00:37:37.652 --> 00:37:39.873]  He was saying some insulting things.
[00:37:40.013 --> 00:37:41.593]  Yeah, Leslie Jones.
[00:37:41.673 --> 00:37:44.454]  It's a comedian who's in the Ghostbusters film.
[00:37:44.814 --> 00:37:51.056]  He said some insulting things and they got his Twitter followers to, you know, ban together and start insulting her.
[00:37:51.477 --> 00:37:53.997]  And so she talked to the CEO of Twitter.
[00:37:54.497 --> 00:37:55.338]  Permanently banned.
[00:37:55.458 --> 00:37:55.898]  What do you think?
[00:37:56.516 --> 00:38:02.541]  Well, I mean, I like free speech, but I also think that Twitter is a private company, and they have the right to do whatever they want.
[00:38:02.781 --> 00:38:17.573]  Like, so if they ban Milo Yiannopoulos, then... Even though, like, you know, I like free speech, and I think that he has a right to say things, but I don't think that Twitter is, like, should be forced to keep everyone on site that, you know, like...
[00:38:19.828 --> 00:38:26.375]  Do you think Milo should actually be banned because he got people to complain about her movie?
[00:38:26.415 --> 00:38:29.277]  Because he's now been permanently suspended off Twitter.
[00:38:29.297 --> 00:38:29.698]  What do you think?
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.340]  I mean, I think that was a good measure.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:37.101]  And since he's a public figure, he should also apologize because he's encouraging bullying and he has a position of power.
[00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:38.822]  So, I mean, that's not cool.
[00:38:39.302 --> 00:38:43.122]  Well, what about free speech to say, hey, I don't like your movie.
[00:38:43.182 --> 00:38:45.343]  Hey, I don't think you're a funny comedian.
[00:38:45.783 --> 00:38:46.923]  That should be banned.
[00:38:47.003 --> 00:38:55.004]  What about people who are ISIS sympathizers or people who are with Black Lives Matter who say, look, I just showed you, kill the cops.
[00:38:55.064 --> 00:38:58.165]  Is it because he's famous and he has a larger reach?
[00:38:58.985 --> 00:39:03.108]  I mean, I think free speech in general doesn't mean you can say what you want without consequence.
[00:39:03.128 --> 00:39:08.331]  Like, you have the right to, like, yell fire in a movie theater, but there's consequences for that, because you're going to start a riot.
[00:39:08.672 --> 00:39:14.956]  To me, that doesn't sound like a free speech issue as much as him violating some terms and conditions that are inherent in, like, his contract with Twitter.
[00:39:14.976 --> 00:39:15.076]  Yeah.
[00:39:15.096 --> 00:39:21.941]  Because I don't think you're allowed to, like, give someone's private information and then direct thousands of any type of messages their way that are unsolicited.
[00:39:22.221 --> 00:39:24.643]  Well, yeah, it wasn't her private information.
[00:39:24.683 --> 00:39:26.344]  It was just her public Twitter account.
[00:39:26.884 --> 00:39:34.768]  I definitely think that when you're getting someone to be like attacked like that on Twitter, that's bullying.
[00:39:35.389 --> 00:39:38.350]  I definitely can relate to cyberbullying in that sense.
[00:39:38.811 --> 00:39:40.331]  I don't think there's any room for that.
[00:39:41.312 --> 00:39:50.817]  When it comes to free speech, honestly, I feel like there are a lot of people who don't really, they want to tout free speech, free speech, but they also do not like to think about the repercussions that come along with it.
[00:39:50.897 --> 00:39:54.999]  So, I mean, you're free to do whatever it is that you want, but at the same time you need to also
[00:39:57.641 --> 00:40:02.042]  You just need to expect consequences, too, especially if you're going to be touting out really negative things.
[00:40:02.062 --> 00:40:02.282]  Right.
[00:40:02.482 --> 00:40:12.366]  So, I mean, if Twitter wants to ban people like that, especially if you're inciting really hateful language and hateful ideology, I feel like, hey, if that's up to Twitter, they can definitely do it.
[00:40:12.826 --> 00:40:17.848]  You think people, ISIS people, Black Lives Matter, if they're, like, saying violent things, they should be banned?
[00:40:18.208 --> 00:40:20.409]  Versus somebody who just said, oh, I don't like your movie?
[00:40:22.051 --> 00:40:25.314]  Yeah, honestly, like, the Black Lives Matter.
[00:40:25.554 --> 00:40:31.119]  I mean, I get how people, you know, are hurt from people, you know, killing other black folks.
[00:40:31.339 --> 00:40:50.835]  And, you know, I think, you know, it's not only, well, when they say Black Lives Matter, it's not like they mean only black people matter, you know, like, they mean, like, oh, there's a lot going on that, you know, it's not fair for some cop to, like, come and, like, you know, just the way, just by the way you look, you know, judge you by it.
[00:40:51.158 --> 00:40:54.761]  Well, I understand that part, but they're saying, like, put them pigs in a blanket.
[00:40:55.101 --> 00:40:57.743]  They're saying, these are actual screenshots from Twitter.
[00:40:58.104 --> 00:41:01.106]  They're saying, like, don't feel bad for those pigs.
[00:41:01.146 --> 00:41:03.068]  They wanted a race war, now they got one.
[00:41:03.108 --> 00:41:04.829]  They killed six pigs in Dallas.
[00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:05.610]  Ha ha ha ha.
[00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:08.412]  So I'm just wondering, like, who?
[00:41:08.512 --> 00:41:09.253]  Yeah, right.
[00:41:09.513 --> 00:41:10.073]  It's just mad.
[00:41:10.153 --> 00:41:11.034]  It's just mad.
[00:41:11.294 --> 00:41:16.759]  He pretty much incited all of his followers to go and completely attack Leslie Jones.
[00:41:16.859 --> 00:41:19.201]  And, I mean, I thought he was just absolutely disgusting.
[00:41:19.221 --> 00:41:20.542]  I mean, again, yes, free speech.
[00:41:20.862 --> 00:41:25.848]  But he was participating in active bullying, and he was rallying other people to just harass her.
[00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:27.330]  So harassment?
[00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.731]  Mm-mm.
[00:41:27.911 --> 00:41:31.856]  I feel like there's no room for that, and I feel like Twitter was definitely right for doing what they did.
[00:41:32.529 --> 00:41:41.034]  It's fitting that I'm here on the University of Texas campus in front of the Cesar Chavez statue because he said that you can't oppress those who aren't afraid anymore.
[00:41:41.974 --> 00:41:53.861]  Everyone out here pretty much has been saying that Milo Yiannopoulos should be banned from Twitter for insulting Leslie Jones, the Ghostbuster actress, and getting his Twitter followers to come after her.
[00:41:54.741 --> 00:41:59.084]  Regardless of what you think, I believe it's an attack on free speech.
[00:41:59.464 --> 00:42:12.571]  We have leftists who are continuously trying to stop us from being able to express even the most simple opinions, and they're using bullying as a way to break down the Bill of Rights one by one, and it's starting with the First Amendment.
[00:42:13.131 --> 00:42:17.612]  And as a journalist, we know that the First Amendment is the most important one.
[00:42:17.652 --> 00:42:19.573]  There's a reason why it's the first one.
[00:42:20.093 --> 00:42:26.755]  And Twitter is a place where people can actually assemble on the Internet and be able to speak freely.
[00:42:27.295 --> 00:42:35.098]  What they're doing to Milo Yiannopoulos is what could be done to you tomorrow if you upset someone, if you hurt someone's feelings on the Internet.
[00:42:35.538 --> 00:42:39.919]  So let's stand up against people trying to block free speech on social media.
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.651]  I'm Ashley Beckford for InfoWars.com.
[00:42:42.933 --> 00:42:44.721]  Stay tuned for more special reports.
[00:42:45.543 --> 00:42:54.607]  Twitter has slapped a lifetime ban on Milo Yiannopoulos for saying that the new Ghostbusters movie sucked and criticizing one of its lead actors, Leslie Jones.
[00:42:54.767 --> 00:43:01.110]  According to Twitter, Milo was banned for, quote, inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others.
[00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:09.573]  This was parroted by the New York Times, who said that Jones had suffered, quote, racist and sexist remarks, rallied and directed by Mr. Yiannopoulos.
[00:43:09.773 --> 00:43:13.875]  Time Magazine said Milo was, quote, involved in a campaign of racial harassment.
[00:43:14.355 --> 00:43:16.856]  Yet there's no evidence for this whatsoever.
[00:43:17.096 --> 00:43:19.737]  All these media outlets are brazenly lying.
[00:43:19.757 --> 00:43:21.178]  This provably never happened.
[00:43:21.238 --> 00:43:21.738]  That's it.
[00:43:21.758 --> 00:43:22.858]  That's not harassment.
[00:43:22.898 --> 00:43:23.859]  It's a statement of fact.
[00:43:40.265 --> 00:43:45.751]  And it isn't proof of Milo inciting a targeted campaign of abuse against Jones.
[00:43:45.871 --> 00:43:54.140]  There's no proof whatsoever that Milo incited the targeted abuse or harassment of Leslie Jones, who did engage in the incitement of targeted abuse against another Twitter user.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:54.901]  Hmm, who could it possibly be?
[00:43:54.921 --> 00:44:01.988]  Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
[00:44:01.988 --> 00:44:03.049]  And it was Leslie Jones.
[00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:10.598]  She sent out a tweet on Monday inciting her followers to target someone with whom she disagreed.
[00:44:10.678 --> 00:44:10.959]  Bitch!
[00:44:11.219 --> 00:44:14.243]  I want to tell you about yourself, but I'm gonna let everybody else do it.
[00:44:14.483 --> 00:44:15.504]  I'm gonna retweet your hate.
[00:44:15.865 --> 00:44:16.425]  Get her!
[00:44:16.606 --> 00:44:17.206]  Get her!
[00:44:17.907 --> 00:44:21.489]  That's inciting targeted harassment right there.
[00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:26.773]  Under Twitter's own rules, Leslie Jones should have her account terminated.
[00:44:26.913 --> 00:44:31.416]  She did the precise thing that Milo was wrongly banned for.
[00:44:31.536 --> 00:44:36.339]  She openly incited the targeted harassment of another Twitter user.
[00:44:36.379 --> 00:44:39.942]  Not to mention engaging in routine, casual racism.
[00:44:39.962 --> 00:44:41.543]  But Twitter's a private company.
[00:44:41.603 --> 00:44:43.524]  It can refuse service to anyone it likes.
[00:44:43.784 --> 00:44:44.385]  Oh really?
[00:44:44.565 --> 00:44:47.587]  So can Christian Bakeries refuse service to gays?
[00:44:48.067 --> 00:44:50.249]  Oh no, that's right, they get fined and shut down.
[00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:51.630]  But that has nothing to do with it.
[00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:53.391]  You're talking about discrimination law.
[00:44:53.491 --> 00:44:59.695]  Except that law isn't applied when it comes to Muslim bakeries refusing to bake gay wedding cakes.
[00:44:59.855 --> 00:45:08.761]  Just like Twitter's own rules aren't applied to leftists who engage in violent rhetoric or who incite targeted harassment.
[00:45:08.801 --> 00:45:12.704]  Do you know how many threats of violence and outright death threats
[00:45:13.204 --> 00:45:20.008]  I've personally reported to Twitter only to see nothing happen every time.
[00:45:20.028 --> 00:45:31.274]  So while Twitter was wasting its time and resources on censoring a gay conservative who gave a movie a bad review, ISIS supporters were celebrating terrorist attacks.
[00:45:31.474 --> 00:45:37.618]  An actual ISIS jihadist was allowed to threaten terror on Twitter for six months.
[00:45:38.098 --> 00:45:39.519]  And they did nothing.
[00:45:39.719 --> 00:45:46.182]  Over the last two years, Black Lives Matter supporters have called for killing police officers on a daily basis.
[00:45:46.322 --> 00:45:50.844]  Those threats intensified after the murder of five cops in Dallas.
[00:45:51.004 --> 00:45:52.365]  How did Twitter respond?
[00:45:52.865 --> 00:45:55.146]  It gave them their own emoji!
[00:45:55.246 --> 00:46:05.411]  So I guess under these new rules, prominent Twitter users with hundreds of thousands of followers are now personally responsible for racist and violent tweets.
[00:46:05.831 --> 00:46:07.512]  Sent by their followers.
[00:46:07.592 --> 00:46:18.456]  Does that mean D. Ray McKesson or Shaun King will be held personally responsible for the deluge of violent threats and incitements to kill cops tweeted by Black Lives Matter supporters?
[00:46:18.556 --> 00:46:29.181]  Does that mean apologists for radical Islam like Glenn Greenwald will be held personally responsible for ISIS propaganda or death threats sent to conservatives by Islamists?
[00:46:29.381 --> 00:46:33.383]  Is Justin Bieber responsible when his fans cut themselves with the hashtag CutForBieber?
[00:46:33.883 --> 00:46:38.025]  Is Beyoncé responsible when her fans go after One Directioners with death threats and rape threats?
[00:46:38.085 --> 00:46:38.725]  Of course not.
[00:46:38.985 --> 00:46:45.087]  It's preposterous to suggest that a public figure, an entertainment personality, or a prominent journalist is responsible for what other people post on the internet.
[00:46:45.107 --> 00:46:57.933]  Does that mean feminists like Anita Sarkeesian, or social justice warriors in general, will be held personally responsible for the mob witch hunts that ruin people's lives and destroy their careers on a regular basis?
[00:46:58.153 --> 00:46:58.833]  No, they won't.
[00:47:02.978 --> 00:47:07.962]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.304 --> 00:48:53.185]  We're good to go.
[00:49:07.791 --> 00:49:11.715]  After the smoke cleared, it appears one coup leads to another.
[00:49:11.935 --> 00:49:21.203]  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan may or may not have been the victim of a coup by a small minority of military leadership this past Friday.
[00:49:21.363 --> 00:49:27.309]  The biggest elephant in the room being, had Erdogan been the target, he would have been taken out easily.
[00:49:27.529 --> 00:49:38.518]  However, as Michael Snyder of End of the American Dream writes, if you are going to conduct a military coup, the very first thing that should be on your list is to decapitate the current leadership structure.
[00:49:38.638 --> 00:49:45.403]  But even though hundreds were killed and approximately 1,400 people were injured during the short-lived conflict,
[00:49:45.603 --> 00:50:01.890]  Not a single high-ranking official was killed or captured, and Reuters reported, at the height of the attempt to overthrow Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, the rebel pilots of two F-16 fighter jets had Erdogan's plane in their sights, and yet he was able to fly on.
[00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:02.870]  The, quote,
[00:50:04.631 --> 00:50:06.132]  Had begun on Friday, July 15th.
[00:50:06.552 --> 00:50:09.054]  Erdogan was on holiday on the coast.
[00:50:09.274 --> 00:50:13.518]  Meanwhile, a war zone unfolded in Istanbul and Ankara.
[00:50:13.678 --> 00:50:19.502]  That night, soldiers ordered state television to read a statement declaring that the military had seized control.
[00:50:19.582 --> 00:50:32.912]  The Telegraph reported the military stated it had seized control to reinstall the constitutional order Democracy, Human Rights and Freedoms to ensure that the rule of law once again reigns in the country for law and order to be reinstated.
[00:50:33.092 --> 00:50:46.981]  But as Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported, several soldiers have said that they had been told that they would be taking part in a military drill, and that it was only when people began to climb onto the tanks that they realized they were involved in a coup attempt.
[00:50:47.362 --> 00:51:00.951]  On Saturday, as the Erdogan coup subsided and another coup against the educational leaders' justice system and religious leaders of Turkey was ignited, after speaking with Turkish officials, President Obama made a beeline to go play golf.
[00:51:01.351 --> 00:51:09.254]  Meanwhile, Obama's ally, Erdogan, proceeded to hunt down one head in particular related to the root of his prospective dictatorship.
[00:51:09.494 --> 00:51:18.597]  Fethullah Gulen, an aging Turkish cleric, a major influence on the overall narrative of opposition in Turkey, who now resides in Pennsylvania.
[00:51:18.817 --> 00:51:28.240]  Erdogan is now asking President Obama to return Gulen back to Turkey to silence any opposition to Erdogan's forthcoming full-blown dictatorship.
[00:51:28.461 --> 00:51:29.661]  The BBC reported,
[00:51:29.941 --> 00:51:39.445]  More than 1,500 university deans have also been ordered to resign and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions revoked.
[00:51:39.825 --> 00:51:45.668]  The Army, Judiciary, Security and Civil Service have all been targeted following Friday's coup attempt.
[00:51:46.729 --> 00:51:51.234]  6,000 military personnel have been arrested, with more than two dozen generals awaiting trial.
[00:51:51.394 --> 00:51:54.377]  Nearly 9,000 police officers have been fired.
[00:51:54.578 --> 00:51:57.321]  Close to 3,000 judges have been suspended.
[00:51:57.481 --> 00:52:02.566]  Some 1,500 employees of Turkey's finance ministry have been dismissed.
[00:52:03.067 --> 00:52:05.750]  492 have been fired from the Religious Affairs Directorate
[00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:15.033]  Turkey's media regulation body on Tuesday also revoked the licenses of 24 radio and TV channels accused of links to Mr. Gulen.
[00:52:15.173 --> 00:52:24.396]  When you pull back the curtain on Erdogan's regime, the clear indication that a growing alliance between Erdogan's administration and ISIS has quietly been germinating.
[00:52:24.636 --> 00:52:26.817]  Daniel Pipes of the Washington Times writes,
[00:52:27.017 --> 00:52:40.684]  Kurds, academic experts, and the Syrian opposition agree that Turks, estimated to number 3,000, and foreign fighters, especially Saudis but also a fair number of Westerners, have crossed the Turkish-Syrian border at will, often to join ISIS.
[00:52:41.024 --> 00:52:51.589]  What Turkish journalist Godri Gürsel calls a two-way jihadist highway has no bothersome border checks and sometimes involves the active assistance of Turkish intelligence services.
[00:52:51.849 --> 00:52:55.550]  In actuality, the Turks offered far more than an easy border crossing.
[00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:59.572]  They provided the bulk of ISIS funds, logistics, training, and arms.
[00:52:59.892 --> 00:53:09.555]  Turkish residents near the Syrian border tell of Turkish ambulances going to Kurdish ISIS battle zones and then evacuating ISIS casualties to Turkish hospitals.
[00:53:09.975 --> 00:53:19.680]  Indeed, a sensational photograph has surfaced showing ISIS commander Abu Muhammad in a hospital bed receiving treatment for battle wounds in Hatay State Hospital in April of 2014.
[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:27.343]  One Turkish opposition politician estimates that Turkey has paid $800 million to ISIS for oil shipments.
[00:53:27.663 --> 00:53:32.986]  Another politician released information about active duty Turkish soldiers training ISIS members.
[00:53:33.226 --> 00:53:43.394]  Critics note that Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan has met three times with someone named Yasin al-Qadi, who has close ties to ISIS and has funded it.
[00:53:43.714 --> 00:54:00.906]  Essentially, Turkey, a majority Sunni Muslim country, but still a secular country, home to Turks, Jews, Greeks, and Arabs, is transforming into an ISIS stronghold under the newfound popularity future dictator President Erdogan gained after his quote, coup, unquote.
[00:54:01.107 --> 00:54:02.908]  John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:54:12.717 --> 00:54:12.937]  Yeah.
[00:54:12.997 --> 00:54:14.338]  Working classes have no nation.
[00:54:15.579 --> 00:54:16.020]  And that's true.
[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:17.801]  And I said it to that guy over there, man.
[00:54:17.981 --> 00:54:18.802]  That's the reason.
[00:54:19.002 --> 00:54:19.862]  Well, you can disagree.
[00:54:19.882 --> 00:54:20.803]  I disagree with you.
[00:54:20.823 --> 00:54:21.263]  That's fine.
[00:54:21.324 --> 00:54:26.988]  If you spent your time, though, instead of protesting, like, building your own business and making yourself successful... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:54:27.008 --> 00:54:28.489]  You're missing the key point.
[00:54:28.529 --> 00:54:29.630]  We're against businesses.
[00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:32.872]  Why would we create our own business if we're against... Let me tell you something about... Why would you work?
[00:54:32.892 --> 00:54:35.734]  How are the workers going to control the means of production if they don't want to work?
[00:54:35.794 --> 00:54:36.935]  And worker cooperations.
[00:54:36.975 --> 00:54:37.856]  We have some.
[00:54:37.936 --> 00:54:39.938]  Baltimore just opened a worker cooperative.
[00:54:40.798 --> 00:54:46.279]  So would the unions of workers come together and make a business for workers to work at?
[00:54:46.539 --> 00:54:49.360]  It's not exactly a business because there's no surplus wealth going to capital.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:50.280]  It would be a business.
[00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:51.060]  It's an industry.
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:54.681]  We have to reinvest in your business to make things happen in the future.
[00:54:54.701 --> 00:54:57.201]  But see, here's my argument against co-ops, because I don't think co-ops is enough.
[00:54:57.241 --> 00:54:59.262]  I think, once again, it's all about democratic control of means of production.
[00:54:59.282 --> 00:55:00.762]  Well, right now it starts with co-ops, though.
[00:55:01.402 --> 00:55:02.163]  I'll call it flat rule.
[00:55:02.183 --> 00:55:03.263]  I'll give you that comment.
[00:55:03.363 --> 00:55:07.324]  If you don't want it, I'll start my Trotskyist splinter party right now!
[00:55:09.644 --> 00:55:10.204]  I'll have to see.
[00:55:10.224 --> 00:55:11.045]  You guys don't get that, do you?
[00:55:11.065 --> 00:55:12.726]  Are y'all from... No, I'm getting it all.
[00:55:12.766 --> 00:55:14.947]  No, I mean, like, you don't get it.
[00:55:15.327 --> 00:55:16.527]  No, yeah, I don't get anything.
[00:55:16.547 --> 00:55:18.108]  But he doesn't know who Trotsky is.
[00:55:21.488 --> 00:55:22.248]  I know who Trotsky is.
[00:55:22.368 --> 00:55:22.648]  Okay.
[00:55:22.808 --> 00:55:23.029]  Okay.
[00:55:23.709 --> 00:55:23.889]  Great.
[00:55:23.989 --> 00:55:24.529]  Wow.
[00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:25.649]  You're learning something.
[00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:28.310]  Maybe they'll actually read Marx this time before they criticize him.
[00:55:28.330 --> 00:55:34.492]  I just think it's funny that what I mentioned, why don't you go form your own business and work on that instead of just holding signs at me.
[00:55:34.653 --> 00:55:38.694]  Let's talk about the other question we were talking about in terms of the working classes, man.
[00:55:39.174 --> 00:55:42.515]  Once again, the working classes are where it's all about.
[00:55:42.995 --> 00:55:47.237]  We have more in common with a working class person from another country than I do with any capitalist from here.
[00:55:47.797 --> 00:55:49.658]  Or fascists, like some of these other fuckin' people.
[00:55:49.678 --> 00:55:50.799]  You should go talk to them.
[00:55:50.819 --> 00:55:51.660]  Mr. Eugenics down there.
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:54.362]  And who do you consider- whoa.
[00:55:54.382 --> 00:55:55.383]  Yeah, there you go.
[00:55:55.403 --> 00:55:56.103]  I mean, I don't know.
[00:55:56.163 --> 00:55:56.964]  I'm against eugenics.
[00:55:57.124 --> 00:55:57.484]  Okay, cool.
[00:55:57.504 --> 00:55:59.946]  Are you guys- I would say, I would say- Here are your info words.
[00:56:00.026 --> 00:56:01.227]  I highly doubt that.
[00:56:01.387 --> 00:56:01.627]  Really?
[00:56:01.967 --> 00:56:03.849]  We made a whole film about eugenics.
[00:56:03.969 --> 00:56:06.811]  They're crazy, but they're not eugenics crazy.
[00:56:07.091 --> 00:56:09.573]  Well, where'd you get that shirt from?
[00:56:09.993 --> 00:56:10.153]  Huh?
[00:56:10.213 --> 00:56:10.774]  Oh, my union.
[00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:11.755]  Did you buy it?
[00:56:12.435 --> 00:56:14.116]  No, a union, it was union labor.
[00:56:14.217 --> 00:56:16.258]  Our union made it.
[00:56:16.278 --> 00:56:19.361]  Our union workers made it, and then they built it.
[00:56:19.441 --> 00:56:21.823]  And we got it from union labor.
[00:56:21.843 --> 00:56:24.605]  It was all union, from the way out.
[00:56:24.645 --> 00:56:26.707]  You can go to our website and check it out.
[00:56:27.467 --> 00:56:30.149]  Union, you organize workers, and we did.
[00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:33.932]  We organized workers at Suguma Farms.
[00:56:34.173 --> 00:56:35.173]  We stood in solidarity with them.
[00:56:35.193 --> 00:56:40.778]  We said, no one's buying berries unless the farm workers, the ones who pick the berries, get their just desserts.
[00:56:41.219 --> 00:56:42.603]  We're still on active.
[00:56:42.863 --> 00:56:44.648]  They're talking about organizing with them.
[00:56:50.382 --> 00:56:52.084]  Alright, well we're going to agree to disagree.
[00:56:52.644 --> 00:56:54.066]  I'll put my hand out to shake it if you want.
[00:56:54.706 --> 00:56:56.988]  We're not going to fall for that.
[00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:03.114]  Alright, we know this is what we're up against people.
[00:57:05.096 --> 00:57:07.678]  People that don't want to work, don't want to do anything.
[00:57:08.159 --> 00:57:09.820]  I am a carpenter, I do work.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:10.421]  Oh you do work?
[00:57:10.581 --> 00:57:11.922]  Yeah, so I build these fucking buildings.
[00:57:11.982 --> 00:57:13.544]  Yeah, okay, and what do you do with that money?
[00:57:13.884 --> 00:57:14.825]  You buy things with it, right?
[00:57:15.625 --> 00:57:16.845]  That's what makes the world go round.
[00:57:16.905 --> 00:57:17.606]  It's always has to change.
[00:57:17.626 --> 00:57:21.166]  So I have to pay them shit wages so they can't buy any of our shit capitals.
[00:57:21.286 --> 00:57:22.327]  Work for yourself.
[00:57:22.707 --> 00:57:23.407]  Work for yourself.
[00:57:23.587 --> 00:57:24.387]  That's what it's all about.
[00:57:25.067 --> 00:57:26.668]  Actually, I kind of do work for myself.
[00:57:27.008 --> 00:57:29.228]  Yeah, because by not having a... You're a capitalist!
[00:57:29.248 --> 00:57:30.009]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:30.049 --> 00:57:31.129]  No, I work for myself.
[00:57:31.149 --> 00:57:31.569]  Yeah, you are!
[00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:32.369]  You work for yourself.
[00:57:32.389 --> 00:57:33.069]  You're a capitalist.
[00:57:33.549 --> 00:57:34.470]  They own their own labor.
[00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:35.670]  We're talking about everyone doing that.
[00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:36.510]  I own my own labor.
[00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:37.850]  I do my own work.
[00:57:38.291 --> 00:57:39.931]  I make my own... Own your own tools.
[00:57:40.271 --> 00:57:42.274]  Use capital to buy your tools and your truck and everything else.
[00:57:42.294 --> 00:57:43.175]  No, that's not capital, dude.
[00:57:43.195 --> 00:57:43.636]  That's money.
[00:57:43.896 --> 00:57:46.459]  I still have to use money because I'm in the capital system.
[00:57:46.499 --> 00:57:48.241]  It doesn't mean I agree with using the money.
[00:57:48.982 --> 00:57:55.010]  So you're saying, say, I still have to... If you want to be a communist, you have to go live in the woods, and you can't use iPhones, you can't use anything else.
[00:57:55.090 --> 00:57:57.713]  And you can't pay for a ride to get some machine tickets, you know, because...
[00:57:58.490 --> 00:57:59.310]  What do you think those guys are?
[00:57:59.771 --> 00:58:03.192]  Hey, next time we'll take back the five hour work week we fought for.
[00:58:03.312 --> 00:58:08.334]  Actually, Tom Morello is in our union, so I don't really have to pay for change.
[00:58:08.494 --> 00:58:09.895]  We get free shirts, right?
[00:58:09.935 --> 00:58:11.035]  Free stuff, the best kind of stuff.
[00:58:11.255 --> 00:58:12.876]  That's the only thing socialists want, it's just free stuff.
[00:58:12.896 --> 00:58:13.536]  Free, that's it.
[00:58:13.936 --> 00:58:16.017]  Are you for free stuff, or do you think you have to work for it?
[00:58:16.357 --> 00:58:18.738]  I think that all labor is entitled to the goods that they produce.
[00:58:19.979 --> 00:58:20.379]  There you go.
[00:58:20.899 --> 00:58:23.921]  Teach according to their abilities, teach according to each according to their means.
[00:58:26.105 --> 00:58:27.807]  Alright, we'll end it there.
[00:58:28.067 --> 00:58:29.868]  I like the way you attracted a small crowd.
[00:58:31.269 --> 00:58:31.970]  Lively debate.
[00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:33.451]  Alright, you guys have a good one.
[00:58:33.952 --> 00:58:34.272]  Later.
[00:58:34.332 --> 00:58:35.673]  Rob Deere reporting for InfoWars.com

[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.934]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.394 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.387]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.787 --> 00:59:36.008]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.308 --> 00:59:38.608]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
