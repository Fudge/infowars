[00:00:20.128 --> 00:00:20.968]  Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:23.070]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.070]  I'm Darren McBreen.
[00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.091]  It is Tuesday, July 19th, 2016.
[00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:29.273]  Here's a quick look at what's coming up.
[00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:33.395]  Tonight...
[00:00:35.697 --> 00:00:45.803]  With over 140,000 signatures in tow, the White House scoffs at the petition labeling Black Lives Matter a terrorist organization.
[00:00:46.924 --> 00:00:51.246]  And cowardly commies attack Alex Jones from behind.
[00:00:52.167 --> 00:00:52.827]  That's next.
[00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:22.156]  It looks like the Comet has started to attack, Alex, and he defended himself.
[00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:02.377]  Hi, I'm Dr. David Jones.
[00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:05.420]  I've been in practice for over 30 years in dentistry.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.444]  In our health histories, we've always asked what people's primary complaint were.
[00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:12.006]  A third of the time, it's, I want whiter teeth.
[00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:26.279]  In the early days of dentistry, we used some fairly harsh chemicals in order to bleach the teeth and whiten them, and people were happy with the results, even though it created hypersensitivity and some problems that I consider fairly high risk.
[00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.901]  Recently, I was exposed to the Ghost Smile System.
[00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:36.324]  It allows a whitening gel to be applied to the teeth with a very good ultrasonic toothbrush system.
[00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:51.691]  The gel is activated by a light-emitting diode, or actually two light-emitting diodes, so it's a simple and elegant procedure that delivers office-quality whitening, and you don't have to spend the $600 it typically costs for an in-office treatment.
[00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:55.795]  In my opinion, it's the most elegant and best value that I've ever seen.
[00:02:56.016 --> 00:02:59.820]  To get your GoSmile system, go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:03:02.335 --> 00:03:11.702]  Barack Hussein Obama has rejected a petition to designate Black Lives Matter as a terrorist organization.
[00:03:12.183 --> 00:03:28.095]  It didn't take long for the White House to respond to a petition that managed to get over 140,000 signatures in less than two weeks, asking the Obama administration to declare Black Lives Matter as a terrorist group.
[00:03:28.715 --> 00:03:33.397]  No doubt, the longer Obama sat on this petition, the more signatures it would have gotten.
[00:03:33.477 --> 00:03:41.901]  And I think if it wasn't rejected so quickly, we might have been eventually looking at a million or so signatures.
[00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:44.762]  But it was rejected.
[00:03:44.842 --> 00:03:55.287]  The petition's lifespan was cut short, much like the lifespans of police officers in Dallas and more recently in Baton Rouge.
[00:03:56.007 --> 00:03:56.548]  Cut short!
[00:03:57.506 --> 00:04:02.928]  In all fairness, there's also been plenty of people out there whose lives have been cut short by the police.
[00:04:03.288 --> 00:04:08.069]  People like Philando Castillo, and Kelly Thomas, and countless others.
[00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:22.834]  Now, I want to read what it says in this petition, and then we'll give you Barack Obama's response, plus we'll take a look at what Hillary Clinton says about all this, and we'll compare all that to honest, reasonable, and rational thinking.
[00:04:23.355 --> 00:04:23.995]  Because this is
[00:04:24.955 --> 00:04:31.680]  Two ideologies that we're talking about here, and they're both very, very different from one another.
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.102]  First, let's take a look at what is in this petition.
[00:04:35.903 --> 00:04:53.735]  It is time for the Pentagon to be consistent in its actions, and just as they rightfully declared ISIS as a terror group, they must declare Black Lives Matter a terrorist group on the grounds of principle, integrity, morality, and safety.
[00:04:54.275 --> 00:05:00.640]  Terrorism is defined as the use of violence and intimidation in pursuit of political gains.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.981]  You got that right.
[00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:09.246]  And this definition is the same definition used to declare ISIS and other groups as terrorists.
[00:05:09.746 --> 00:05:11.407]  Signed, we the people.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.203]  Makes a lot of sense to me, but once you know it, Obama doesn't see it that way.
[00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:28.050]  In fact, he predictably disagrees, and once again, he gives the impression that he's actually siding with Black Lives Matter on this issue.
[00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.433]  Obama responded to the petition first by flat out rejecting it.
[00:05:33.954 --> 00:05:39.017]  He said the White House plays no role in designating domestic terror organizations.
[00:05:39.538 --> 00:05:43.060]  Yeah, unless they just happen to be constitutionalist or sovereign citizens, right?
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:51.623]  He went on to say he knows that there are some people who have criticized even the phrase Black Lives Matter.
[00:05:52.004 --> 00:05:52.584]  Imagine that.
[00:05:53.164 --> 00:05:59.047]  As if the notion is that other lives don't matter and that is simply not the case.
[00:06:00.387 --> 00:06:09.791]  When incidents like this occur, there's a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if
[00:06:12.602 --> 00:06:16.585]  And because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same.
[00:06:19.868 --> 00:06:20.369]  And that hurts.
[00:06:37.068 --> 00:06:38.529]  You pull your puss out, you bust out.
[00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:42.451]  Because at the end of the day, it's gonna be you against this.
[00:06:42.811 --> 00:06:43.552]  We need action!
[00:06:43.592 --> 00:06:45.233]  You better f***ing take action!
[00:06:45.253 --> 00:06:49.015]  I don't give a f*** whether you knock him over, whether you run up on him.
[00:06:49.315 --> 00:06:52.417]  Whatever you do, you better f***ing take action!
[00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:54.839]  Call for white people like myself.
[00:06:55.559 --> 00:07:16.467]  To put ourselves in the shoes of those African-American families who fear every time their children go somewhere, who have to have the talk about how to really protect themselves when they're the ones who should be expecting protection from encounters with the police.
[00:07:16.647 --> 00:07:20.829]  The effort for women to get the right to vote was
[00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:22.989]  Contentious and messy.
[00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:37.034]  There were times when activists might have engaged in rhetoric that was overheated and occasionally counterproductive.
[00:07:37.154 --> 00:07:44.897]  But the point was to raise issues so that we as a society could grapple with them.
[00:07:46.618 --> 00:07:50.619]  The same was true with the civil rights movement and the union movement and the environmental movement and
[00:07:52.292 --> 00:07:59.657]  The anti-war movement during Vietnam and and I think what you're seeing now is part of that long-standing tradition.
[00:08:06.282 --> 00:08:15.148]  In case you couldn't understand what they were saying at the end of that video that was a Black Lives Matter march in New York City where they were chanting, what do we want?
[00:08:15.549 --> 00:08:16.229]  Dead police!
[00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:17.430]  When do we want?
[00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:18.130]  Now!
[00:08:19.141 --> 00:08:27.637]  Barack Obama says that Black Lives Matter is a rational response and a justified response
[00:08:28.615 --> 00:08:31.236]  to racial profiling by police.
[00:08:32.056 --> 00:08:45.239]  Meanwhile, it is blatantly obvious and there's plenty of evidence that suggests that the leadership among Black Lives Matter is calling for racially motivated violence and the murder and assassinations of police.
[00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:48.279]  That, my friends, that is terrorism.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:55.321]  And they are promoting total war while lone wolves do their dirty work.
[00:08:56.381 --> 00:09:02.803]  Do you condemn the anti-police rhetoric coming from this hateful ideology?
[00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:07.925]  As a journalist sitting here on television, I don't have to condemn anyone, anything.
[00:09:08.305 --> 00:09:11.806]  That is something that you should ask other people around the country.
[00:09:11.967 --> 00:09:13.767]  Is there jobs to condemn that?
[00:09:13.787 --> 00:09:17.909]  Just like I condemn the hateful ideology out of groups like the KKK.
[00:09:18.989 --> 00:09:24.631]  The suspect said he was upset about Black Lives Matter.
[00:09:26.038 --> 00:09:28.982]  He said he was upset about the recent police shootings.
[00:09:30.144 --> 00:09:33.469]  The suspect said he was upset at white people.
[00:09:35.292 --> 00:09:38.937]  The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.
[00:09:40.083 --> 00:09:40.964]  I condemn it.
[00:09:41.865 --> 00:09:49.314]  There is no place in American discourse for that sort of vile, vitriolic hate coming out of this ideology.
[00:09:50.235 --> 00:09:58.986]  You know, I never understood why a lot of people think that the only real black leadership in our country right now are people like, oh,
[00:09:59.947 --> 00:10:05.192]  Jesse Jackson, the Reverend Al Sharpton, and of course, Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:10:05.752 --> 00:10:08.735]  Those people, in my opinion, are not real leaders at all.
[00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.057]  They've never shown any real leadership.
[00:10:11.918 --> 00:10:15.982]  My good friend Larry Pinckney says that he doesn't call them leaders at all.
[00:10:16.022 --> 00:10:19.105]  He says they're misleaders, and I happen to agree with him.
[00:10:19.665 --> 00:10:28.727]  But I'm here to tell you that there is plenty of good, strong black leaders in our country right now, and no better example than these two guys.
[00:10:29.207 --> 00:10:32.488]  Sheriff David Clark and Chief David Brown.
[00:10:33.308 --> 00:10:38.770]  In fact, if that was the party ticket this election, they'd certainly have my vote.
[00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:47.032]  And I think rather than calling it a Democrat or Republican party ticket, we could simply call it the take-no-s**t
[00:10:49.473 --> 00:11:01.641]  And we're joined now by John Rappaport, NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:03.102]  And John, let me get your take on this.
[00:11:03.142 --> 00:11:07.705]  What do you think about Barack Obama's response to the police shootings?
[00:11:07.785 --> 00:11:11.067]  I mean, he's quietly condemned them, but he's yet to
[00:11:12.228 --> 00:11:17.993]  respond, or I guess he's yet to condemn or disavow, I should say, Black Lives Matter.
[00:11:18.013 --> 00:11:19.254]  What do you think is up with that?
[00:11:21.016 --> 00:11:22.897]  Well, he's doing a squeeze play.
[00:11:22.938 --> 00:11:25.560]  I mean, it's a classic both ends against the middle.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:32.266]  On the one hand, he's encouraging Black Lives Matter and the protesters and so forth, meetings.
[00:11:32.786 --> 00:11:37.570]  He, Loretta Lynch, the Attorney General, of course Soros money and so forth.
[00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:50.029]  And so this is egging these people on, do it more, more signs, more crazy stuff, more not solving the problem, you know, etc.
[00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:51.171]  But on the other side,
[00:11:52.193 --> 00:11:55.996]  And this is a big one that I covered recently in an article.
[00:11:56.777 --> 00:12:01.860]  He's continued to militarize police forces all over America.
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:10.327]  We're talking about major, heavy armed forces equipment that is making a national police force.
[00:12:10.447 --> 00:12:16.351]  And of course, he and others of that globalist ilk want to federalize all police.
[00:12:17.032 --> 00:12:19.534]  So this is a classic squeeze play.
[00:12:20.134 --> 00:12:21.234]  To create chaos.
[00:12:21.634 --> 00:12:22.775]  Well, I think you said it perfectly.
[00:12:22.815 --> 00:12:23.355]  That's it.
[00:12:23.455 --> 00:12:26.036]  This is establishing order out of chaos.
[00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:29.457]  And then the federal government comes in as the savior.
[00:12:29.837 --> 00:12:33.818]  And I think the intent this entire time is to nationalize the police force.
[00:12:34.138 --> 00:12:40.880]  So when these people are out there protesting against the police, they don't realize that they're actually going to get more in the process.
[00:12:41.917 --> 00:12:42.497]  Absolutely.
[00:12:42.517 --> 00:12:43.338]  This is a game.
[00:12:43.358 --> 00:13:01.465]  Okay, we get these people to do all the protesting and the violence, and we throw in a few snipers and shooters, and cops start dying, and other people caught in the crossfire also are dying, and this goes on and on, and then on the other hand, we
[00:13:02.785 --> 00:13:16.819]  You know, gen up the police forces, and I'm talking about even community, little community police forces, with armored vehicles and heavy weapons and so forth, because that's going to be the final solution.
[00:13:17.645 --> 00:13:20.727]  And they couldn't do this without the help of the mainstream media.
[00:13:21.107 --> 00:13:26.870]  How do you think Obama, how do you think he cheerleads this whole situation?
[00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:34.615]  What is he doing to encourage protest and maybe even encouraging the shootings and the deaths of police officers?
[00:13:36.343 --> 00:13:40.685]  Well, he's responding to it without the authority of a president.
[00:13:40.946 --> 00:13:45.688]  He's talking about the culture, the social this and that and so forth.
[00:13:46.349 --> 00:13:49.370]  These are all signals of surrender, basically.
[00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:50.571]  He's making victims.
[00:13:50.611 --> 00:13:52.132]  He's making victims out of everyone.
[00:13:52.492 --> 00:13:56.017]  Yeah, the manufacture of victims goes on and on and on.
[00:13:56.418 --> 00:14:03.187]  And that process, I mean, there are genuine victims, but this process of manufacturing them is endless.
[00:14:03.708 --> 00:14:07.433]  There is no end to getting what you want if you are
[00:14:08.254 --> 00:14:09.815]  Visioning yourself as a victim.
[00:14:10.215 --> 00:14:11.075]  It's a way of life.
[00:14:11.155 --> 00:14:12.176]  It goes on forever.
[00:14:12.816 --> 00:14:22.840]  And at some point, the violence is going to rise to a level where this militarized police is going to clamp down very hard.
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.081]  And now, that's the final solution to this.
[00:14:26.881 --> 00:14:29.022]  And he's arming those police.
[00:14:29.102 --> 00:14:29.762]  I mean, come on.
[00:14:30.262 --> 00:14:32.884]  You know, you just look at it and you see.
[00:14:32.904 --> 00:14:40.627]  If he were saying, look, we have to, you know, dial back the police, and he was really serious about it, okay, he's wrong.
[00:14:41.387 --> 00:14:47.770]  But if on the other hand, he's bringing in heavy artillery and weapons and vehicles and
[00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.372]  You know, making this look and be like an army.
[00:14:51.552 --> 00:14:59.737]  Well, I was just going to say, and let's face it, the police, they are militarized, they look more like a standing army than traditional police of the past.
[00:15:00.237 --> 00:15:06.381]  But also, we do know that there is police brutality, there is racial discrimination at times.
[00:15:06.421 --> 00:15:17.308]  I don't think it's nearly as bad as the media portrays it, but for example, Philando Castile, the young man that got murdered recently that was captured on video, the aftermath was captured on cell phone video,
[00:15:17.768 --> 00:15:25.273]  That guy was pulled over over 31 times in his neighborhood and he never had a, he wasn't a felon or anything like that.
[00:15:25.673 --> 00:15:28.255]  So it does look like racial profiling.
[00:15:28.775 --> 00:15:33.658]  But I think that obviously rioting in the streets is not the answer.
[00:15:33.758 --> 00:15:36.020]  Certainly shooting cops is not the answer.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:40.583]  So I think that Black Lives Matter is not the answer and they are just adding fuel to the fire.
[00:15:40.643 --> 00:15:41.043]  Am I right?
[00:15:41.806 --> 00:15:53.017]  Yeah, look, this is being portrayed, all the protests and the violence against cops, this is being portrayed as, this is the problem, the main problem of inner cities.
[00:15:53.618 --> 00:15:54.519]  That's ridiculous.
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:59.043]  Poverty, crime by gangs, drugs.
[00:15:59.904 --> 00:16:03.107]  Total dependence on the government for survival.
[00:16:03.828 --> 00:16:07.251]  These are the major problems that have been plaguing inner cities forever.
[00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:09.533]  And this is all being covered over.
[00:16:09.933 --> 00:16:13.856]  There is no attempt to solve the problems of inner cities, not really.
[00:16:14.237 --> 00:16:16.999]  There never has been since the War on Poverty started in 1966.
[00:16:17.239 --> 00:16:18.240]  This is all a cover.
[00:16:18.781 --> 00:16:20.302]  This is all pretending that if somehow
[00:16:24.966 --> 00:16:30.448]  The police brutality was lowered a few levels that inner cities would be fine.
[00:16:30.808 --> 00:16:31.888]  This is a total lie.
[00:16:32.169 --> 00:16:39.051]  There are millions of people in inner cities right now that are sitting there in their homes who have been hostages basically all their lives.
[00:16:39.391 --> 00:16:50.795]  They're watching these protests on television and they know that nothing good is going to come of this because there are no real solutions here for what's really ailing inner cities and has been for a long time.
[00:16:51.115 --> 00:16:55.260]  Take away the manufacturing jobs through globalist trade treaties.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.942]  Send them all overseas.
[00:16:57.002 --> 00:16:58.383]  Throw people out on the streets.
[00:16:58.924 --> 00:17:05.011]  Now we're talking about actual problems which the government has no intention of solving.
[00:17:05.236 --> 00:17:09.259]  Well, of course not, and this was all done by design, and that brings me to my last question.
[00:17:09.299 --> 00:17:10.900]  We have a minute and a half left.
[00:17:11.641 --> 00:17:21.008]  Who do you think is going to win the election, and what does America look like under a Donald Trump presidency compared to, God forbid, Hillary Clinton?
[00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:26.981]  I'd say right now, you know, it's 50-50 as far as who's going to win the election.
[00:17:27.141 --> 00:17:28.241]  I really don't know.
[00:17:28.261 --> 00:17:35.724]  I mean, Trump has much more support than people are willing to admit in key states as well.
[00:17:36.465 --> 00:17:42.087]  But of course, you know, rigging voting machines, voter fraud of all manner can occur here.
[00:17:42.667 --> 00:17:44.068]  So we don't know what's going to happen.
[00:17:45.609 --> 00:17:48.450]  A Trump presidency is somewhat uncertain because
[00:17:49.451 --> 00:17:51.913]  You know, this is a guy you want to hold his feet to the fire.
[00:17:51.993 --> 00:17:52.493]  Absolutely.
[00:17:52.553 --> 00:17:55.295]  You said this, Donald, now show us, prove it.
[00:17:55.796 --> 00:17:57.997]  With Hillary, it's a known quantity.
[00:17:58.077 --> 00:17:59.699]  We know what to expect with Hillary.
[00:17:59.779 --> 00:18:05.683]  More war, more decimation, more cruelty, more desire for power for the sake of power.
[00:18:05.763 --> 00:18:07.004]  That's what you're going to get with her.
[00:18:07.264 --> 00:18:13.329]  And quite possibly, especially if they keep it 50-50, quite possibly massive voter fraud.
[00:18:14.525 --> 00:18:15.145]  Absolutely.
[00:18:15.605 --> 00:18:17.306]  I would say even if not 50-50.
[00:18:17.406 --> 00:18:30.472]  I mean, right now there are people behind the scenes, I'm quite sure, looking at the key swing states where the election will be decided and saying, OK, what can we do to make this election work in our favor?
[00:18:31.032 --> 00:18:33.493]  So that's always a factor.
[00:18:34.053 --> 00:18:35.154]  Thank you, John Rappaport.
[00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:37.494]  NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[00:18:37.715 --> 00:18:38.315]  Stick around.
[00:18:38.555 --> 00:18:43.237]  Exclusive coverage of the RNC when we come back right after this.
[00:19:01.328 --> 00:19:04.669]  There is an attack on the human institution of family.
[00:19:05.389 --> 00:19:09.030]  And if you want to take down the nuclear family, you attack males.
[00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.691]  Males are the defender of the human tribe.
[00:19:14.251 --> 00:19:18.993]  When men fall, the rest of humanity can be completely enslaved.
[00:19:19.773 --> 00:19:23.474]  The attack on the family is in movies, sitcoms, dramas.
[00:19:23.734 --> 00:19:25.234]  This isn't to empower women.
[00:19:25.755 --> 00:19:27.235]  This is to wreck civilization.
[00:19:27.495 --> 00:19:33.198]  For too long, we have been allowing the globalist controllers to launch a full-scale chemical war on our masculinity.
[00:19:33.398 --> 00:19:34.479]  You've seen the headlines.
[00:19:34.499 --> 00:19:40.122]  The estrogen mimickers and the gender-bending compounds in the food and water supply are changing the way our bodies work.
[00:19:40.242 --> 00:19:44.084]  And men are the number one target of this program.
[00:19:44.284 --> 00:19:47.966]  With the estrogen mimickers in the plastics, in the printer paper, and
[00:19:48.166 --> 00:19:49.366]  Thousands of other items.
[00:19:49.747 --> 00:19:50.447]  It's on record.
[00:19:50.767 --> 00:19:57.169]  Our testosterone level, many times by the time we hit 40, is 80% lower than it should be or more.
[00:19:57.349 --> 00:20:04.851]  Our sperm counts, depending on which western country you look at, are 80 to almost 96% reduced.
[00:20:05.472 --> 00:20:08.593]  Fertility is plummeting through the floor.
[00:20:09.173 --> 00:20:12.814]  Now it's impossible, even if you're a health nut, to avoid all of this.
[00:20:13.574 --> 00:20:14.855]  But for myself personally,
[00:20:15.655 --> 00:20:20.097]  What I've experienced with the products at Infowarslife.com has been simply amazing.
[00:20:20.998 --> 00:20:24.279]  Supermail Vitality has changed my life in the last three years.
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:30.783]  That's why we wanted to develop something that works in conjunction with Supermail to take it to the next level.
[00:20:31.243 --> 00:20:32.744]  It's only been out for about six months.
[00:20:33.584 --> 00:20:42.410]  It sold out so quickly in its first run and now it is back after months of not being available and ThroPlex.
[00:20:43.171 --> 00:20:49.295]  The reason we sell out when other big vitamin and mineral and nutraceutical makers don't
[00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:56.040]  Is because we only source the purest, cleanest, high quality, organic products.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:05.947]  And it's really hard when you've got a formulation that's got a bunch of really great ingredients in it to get them and to always have them be perfectly clean and to be able to pass some of the highest standards in the world.
[00:21:06.247 --> 00:21:17.095]  When you go to InfoWarsLife.com, you can see that for yourself and find out why Anthroplex taken by itself or in conjunction with Super Male Vitality is such a game changer.
[00:21:17.416 --> 00:21:18.656]  This is the next level.
[00:21:19.617 --> 00:21:23.559]  And I'm so proud that we were able to bring a product like this to you.
[00:21:24.219 --> 00:21:26.861]  This is how men were supposed to feel.
[00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:31.583]  Quite frankly, I remember what it felt like to be 18 or 19 or 20.
[00:21:32.123 --> 00:21:36.686]  To be crazed, to be aggressive, to feel just exhilaration.
[00:21:37.566 --> 00:21:46.950]  And it's the Super Mel Vitality and the AnthroPlex with exercise and a better diet that have taken me back to where I was and quite frankly beyond.
[00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:48.090]  It's amazing.
[00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:52.112]  And AnthroPlex is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:52.432 --> 00:21:57.954]  Men, do yourself a favor and get a bottle of AnthroPlex today and see what I'm talking about.
[00:21:58.455 --> 00:22:06.198]  All of our products at InfoWarsLife.com are recognized as safe and they are made in FDA certified labs.
[00:22:06.698 --> 00:22:12.662]  The media tries to demonize supplements because, quite frankly, Mother Nature's got a lot to offer that Big Pharma doesn't.
[00:22:13.283 --> 00:22:17.866]  But there are some bad companies out there and there are some substances that Mother Nature produces that aren't good for you.
[00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:26.952]  That's why everything we put in these products is recognized as safe and produced at the highest level, highest quality FDA certified labs.
[00:22:27.412 --> 00:22:35.591]  Talk to your physician or healthcare provider before you take Anthraplex or any of the products at InfoWarsLife.com like X2.
[00:22:36.092 --> 00:22:36.413]  Because...
[00:22:37.472 --> 00:22:38.152]  This stuff's real.
[00:22:38.552 --> 00:22:41.833]  Just one of the ingredients in anthroplex is horny goat weed.
[00:22:42.093 --> 00:22:47.895]  In Chinese traditional medicine, it is recognized as one of the most powerful male stimulants.
[00:22:48.375 --> 00:22:51.095]  Not just of libido, but overall vitality.
[00:22:51.476 --> 00:22:57.917]  We put together a classic formula, souped up with the highest quality at a very low price.
[00:22:58.377 --> 00:23:00.798]  Available at Infowarslife.com today.
[00:23:10.982 --> 00:23:15.105]  This is the scene outside the convention center moments ago in Cleveland.
[00:23:15.125 --> 00:23:16.927]  Some pushing and shoving going on.
[00:23:16.947 --> 00:23:23.732]  We're not quite sure who is involved, but Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist, is somewhere in the middle of that crowd.
[00:23:23.752 --> 00:23:25.674]  There's a banner there about 9-11.
[00:23:25.914 --> 00:23:27.475]  Research 9-11.
[00:23:27.815 --> 00:23:30.658]  That's what's going on outside the convention center.
[00:23:37.688 --> 00:23:50.195]  We're marching up here to the protest spot where Black Lives Matter, the brand new, the new Black Panther Party, Revcon, QEP Newton Gun Club, which openly carries and calls for the killing of cops.
[00:23:50.395 --> 00:23:54.218]  That's where we're going now, right?
[00:23:56.179 --> 00:23:57.580]  All right, let's just cover this thing.
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.001]  Try to interview them later.
[00:24:01.522 --> 00:24:02.723]  Let's just cover this and just...
[00:24:05.989 --> 00:24:11.314]  Trying to document what's going on.
[00:24:11.734 --> 00:24:13.576]  You want to see George Soros and the Globals?
[00:24:14.597 --> 00:24:16.038]  The destabilization of this country.
[00:24:16.058 --> 00:24:16.518]  This is it.
[00:24:17.019 --> 00:24:18.340]  Hang that camera that way, Buckley.
[00:24:37.073 --> 00:24:48.101]  This is a total destabilization program.
[00:24:48.262 --> 00:24:48.942]  Alex Jones!
[00:24:49.002 --> 00:24:50.723]  Hey brother.
[00:24:50.883 --> 00:24:52.024]  What's up?
[00:24:52.084 --> 00:24:53.986]  Welcome to Ground Zero.
[00:24:57.273 --> 00:25:09.563]  Excuse me, this is not a safe space.
[00:25:09.603 --> 00:25:17.489]  What are you doing?
[00:25:17.609 --> 00:25:18.049]  Alex!
[00:25:18.189 --> 00:25:21.011]  Alex Jones from Info Wars.
[00:25:21.131 --> 00:25:21.872]  Jail Beings.
[00:25:22.312 --> 00:25:22.612]  It's on.
[00:25:22.853 --> 00:25:23.173]  Ready, rock.
[00:25:25.989 --> 00:25:37.478]  What you've got is big giant mega banks funding a bunch of communists and cop killers and other organizations that want to start martial law in this country and derail our elections!
[00:25:38.339 --> 00:25:42.382]  And the American people who are in race terror and creed aren't going to put up with it!
[00:25:43.142 --> 00:25:45.284]  And that's what this comes down to right now.
[00:25:45.804 --> 00:25:55.092]  The communists are a bunch of murdering scum worldwide, and George Soros is a Nazi collaborator funding these organizations trying to bring in total charity.
[00:25:55.592 --> 00:25:59.275]  And we're here as the American people saying that our free country is
[00:25:59.295 --> 00:26:04.318]  He's not going to have a bunch of dirty communists and globalist scumbags set up tyranny.
[00:26:04.678 --> 00:26:09.960]  We are here to promote a free, open election in this country and open a free market.
[00:26:10.301 --> 00:26:11.481]  Here, they want me to get in there.
[00:26:11.501 --> 00:26:12.562]  Let me throw it over to Bill Harnum.
[00:26:13.042 --> 00:26:13.442]  Let him do it!
[00:26:13.482 --> 00:26:14.963]  We're here to challenge you right now!
[00:26:22.824 --> 00:26:23.885]  We're good to go.
[00:26:42.219 --> 00:26:45.420]  1776!
[00:26:42.439 --> 00:26:45.420]  Worldwide liberty ladies and gentlemen!
[00:27:11.221 --> 00:27:16.582]  You're not intimidated by a bunch of fake leftists that are here to try to cause a violent revolution in this country.
[00:27:17.142 --> 00:27:24.064]  We're going to peacefully restore our republic with this election and everybody better get used to it.
[00:27:24.124 --> 00:27:27.784]  Because that's what it comes down to.
[00:27:27.824 --> 00:27:33.886]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars.com is here to expose the tyranny of the globalists.
[00:27:43.052 --> 00:27:47.155]  We're creating division to cause a crisis in this nation, have us fight with each other.
[00:27:47.435 --> 00:27:53.359]  They want war in the streets and a breakdown of society, so we fall like Venezuela and Cuba and the Soviet Union.
[00:27:53.659 --> 00:27:55.660]  So we fall to the tyranny of the globalists.
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.262]  We are here promoting liberty.
[00:27:58.322 --> 00:27:59.863]  We are here promoting freedom.
[00:27:59.903 --> 00:28:07.688]  We are here exposing the globalist agenda and George Soros is funding groups that are murdering police officers and others.
[00:28:07.948 --> 00:28:10.029]  Police are the local government.
[00:28:10.049 --> 00:28:12.511]  They're not the corrupt government on top.
[00:28:14.779 --> 00:28:17.902]  To cause a crisis!
[00:28:27.199 --> 00:28:28.921]  Here we go, here we go.
[00:28:28.941 --> 00:28:30.061]  We're straight in the line here.
[00:28:30.142 --> 00:28:34.485]  We've got crime and extravagance standards all over the country by the Congress.
[00:28:34.545 --> 00:28:39.009]  We've got people openly pushing for this because they want to cause destabilization to the country.
[00:28:39.109 --> 00:28:45.794]  And what we're doing is we're trying to wake these people up because we're told the different groups that are going to be here today.
[00:28:45.874 --> 00:28:53.440]  And so that we're trying to actually expose the fact that those nationals have conquered many other nations like Ukraine and other nations by causing the violence.
[00:28:57.315 --> 00:29:03.678]  I was able to bring these protest groups together to unite with our police department.
[00:29:03.758 --> 00:29:06.560]  I'm talking to Black Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, Back to Blue.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.282]  We came together and stayed united to bring change to our country.
[00:29:09.522 --> 00:29:10.943]  Do you believe in that?
[00:29:11.363 --> 00:29:11.663]  No.
[00:29:11.683 --> 00:29:13.965]  We the people run our country, believe it or not.
[00:29:14.045 --> 00:29:15.766]  We can't do that without you.
[00:29:19.668 --> 00:29:32.021]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are here to tell George Soros and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and the rest of the globalists, you're not going to start a civil war in this country!
[00:29:32.201 --> 00:29:34.544]  You're not going to stop pre-open elections in this country!
[00:29:34.584 --> 00:29:37.807]  You're not a nation, but you're failing here!
[00:29:40.647 --> 00:29:41.047]  Yeah!
[00:29:41.087 --> 00:29:41.527]  Yeah!
[00:29:41.567 --> 00:29:42.968]  Hillary for President!
[00:29:56.212 --> 00:29:57.714]  Hillary for President!
[00:29:58.054 --> 00:29:59.536]  Hillary for President!
[00:29:59.816 --> 00:30:01.798]  Hillary for President!
[00:30:13.444 --> 00:30:15.205]  Let's find a high point.
[00:30:15.285 --> 00:30:16.526]  Hey, let's get up there.
[00:30:16.606 --> 00:30:17.627]  Let's find a high point.
[00:30:17.647 --> 00:30:19.508]  Let's get on the steps.
[00:30:19.548 --> 00:30:20.768]  That's right.
[00:30:20.828 --> 00:30:28.213]  The hate of George Soros, the hate of Obama saying kill cops is not the way.
[00:30:28.253 --> 00:30:33.596]  The hate of Hillary blaming cops and killing cops is not the way.
[00:30:33.656 --> 00:30:34.357]  That's right.
[00:30:34.377 --> 00:30:34.877]  Absolutely.
[00:30:34.897 --> 00:30:35.657]  That's right.
[00:30:35.717 --> 00:30:38.079]  The communists want to kill cops.
[00:30:38.239 --> 00:30:40.040]  We're not putting up with it.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.581]  We're not going along with it.
[00:30:41.941 --> 00:30:46.346]  We understand the violence of the left, the violence of the globalists.
[00:30:46.386 --> 00:30:48.428]  We are here absolutely exposing it.
[00:30:48.448 --> 00:30:50.250]  We're not going to back off.
[00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:51.691]  We're not going to stop.
[00:30:51.712 --> 00:30:54.795]  We are here to expose what's happening.
[00:30:54.835 --> 00:30:57.377]  We are here to expose it.
[00:30:57.418 --> 00:31:00.060]  We are here to expose it.
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.303]  We are here to expose it.
[00:31:02.463 --> 00:31:04.445]  We are here to expose it.
[00:31:06.152 --> 00:31:06.212]  Hey!
[00:31:06.232 --> 00:31:06.292]  Hey!
[00:31:06.312 --> 00:31:06.372]  Hey!
[00:31:06.392 --> 00:31:06.472]  Hey!
[00:31:06.492 --> 00:31:06.552]  Hey!
[00:31:06.572 --> 00:31:06.632]  Hey!
[00:31:35.746 --> 00:31:38.267]  Where's Erica?
[00:31:38.648 --> 00:31:41.890]  Hey, wait, we can't, let's pay attention to Jones.
[00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:43.471]  Pay attention to Jones.
[00:31:43.631 --> 00:31:44.751]  Let's get out of here.
[00:31:44.971 --> 00:31:46.452]  Let's go, let's go.
[00:31:46.693 --> 00:31:49.154]  Oh, we showed up first, though.
[00:31:49.394 --> 00:31:50.075]  Come on, Alex!
[00:31:50.195 --> 00:31:51.255]  Alex Jones, yeah!
[00:31:51.275 --> 00:31:53.457]  We got it, we got it.
[00:32:04.245 --> 00:32:11.172]  So what happens?
[00:32:15.856 --> 00:32:18.398]  He starts speaking the word.
[00:32:23.647 --> 00:32:24.609]  Info war!
[00:32:24.769 --> 00:32:25.730]  Info war!
[00:32:26.091 --> 00:32:27.032]  Info war!
[00:32:27.333 --> 00:32:28.354]  Info war!
[00:32:28.614 --> 00:32:29.716]  Info war!
[00:32:29.836 --> 00:32:30.397]  Move!
[00:32:30.577 --> 00:32:30.717]  Move!
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.061]  Move!
[00:32:36.081 --> 00:32:36.201]  Move!
[00:32:36.221 --> 00:32:36.461]  Move!
[00:32:36.481 --> 00:32:37.142]  Move!
[00:32:37.182 --> 00:32:38.003]  Back it up!
[00:32:38.063 --> 00:32:40.205]  Back it up!
[00:32:40.426 --> 00:32:41.427]  We're here with them!
[00:33:02.526 --> 00:33:07.990]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.031]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.431 --> 00:33:12.493]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[00:33:13.174 --> 00:33:13.634]  30 servings.
[00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:16.436]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[00:33:16.736 --> 00:33:17.797]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.857 --> 00:33:18.818]  Infowarslife.com
[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all of the essential amino acids, all of the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are going to take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:33:59.642]  This is ultra-concentrated.
[00:33:59.662 --> 00:34:00.783]  We're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:02.404]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy.
[00:34:02.444 --> 00:34:03.004]  That's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:03.484]  Yeah.
[00:34:03.584 --> 00:34:05.346]  I want to... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!

[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.690]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:46.694]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:36:46.895 --> 00:36:53.019]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.063]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[00:37:07.645 --> 00:37:12.170]  We just went a few blocks away from what happened a few minutes ago.
[00:37:14.252 --> 00:37:25.484]  Mr. Dix, the founder of one of the major communist organizations in the country, was having a Black Lives Matter event here in Cleveland, just a block away from the RNC.
[00:37:26.365 --> 00:37:28.628]  I mean, the communists have killed hundreds of millions of people.
[00:37:28.648 --> 00:37:29.408]  They're worse than Hitler.
[00:37:30.365 --> 00:37:43.197]  And they've been trying to foment a revolution in this country, and Obama and George Soros, who's a Romanian communist, Soros, have been trying to foment this whole thing that if a cop kills somebody questionably in Minnesota, you go kill five cops in Dallas.
[00:37:43.297 --> 00:37:45.019]  It's the most crazy crap I've ever heard.
[00:37:45.379 --> 00:37:46.641]  Or just randomly shoot people.
[00:37:47.281 --> 00:37:48.102]  So I've been against that.
[00:37:49.043 --> 00:37:51.805]  And I thought, well, let's go out and try to cover this.
[00:37:52.748 --> 00:38:08.095]  And so we went there, we were speaking, there were state police, local police there, you name it, and we were going to go up on top of some of the steps to speak, so we start going up there peacefully, and some communists with red flags start saying Hitler, racist, Nazi, it's all on video, the video's going up on Infowars.com, start hitting me.
[00:38:09.218 --> 00:38:12.401]  And so I just decided to go ahead and push the guy out of my way.
[00:38:13.322 --> 00:38:18.887]  And so suddenly, I pushed through them, and then I didn't know it was the chief of police of Cleveland.
[00:38:18.907 --> 00:38:19.628]  You can't make this up.
[00:38:19.648 --> 00:38:19.988]  It's right there.
[00:38:20.008 --> 00:38:22.271]  He grabs my arm, but he wasn't hitting me, so I stopped.
[00:38:22.831 --> 00:38:28.697]  And then another off-duty police officer, who we actually have right here, actually talked to him, so I didn't get arrested.
[00:38:28.957 --> 00:38:31.359]  Then all the state police came and grabbed me, because I didn't realize
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.101]  They were punching the police.
[00:38:33.121 --> 00:38:34.462]  We have all this video attacking them.
[00:38:34.722 --> 00:38:39.865]  So the police, like Roman techniques, had their bikes, like, walking six attackers at a time.
[00:38:39.885 --> 00:38:40.966]  We have all this epic footage.
[00:38:41.586 --> 00:38:48.531]  It's just crazy how this country's at war when, if you want to blame the federal government or even the state government, blame the governor or blame the president.
[00:38:48.551 --> 00:38:52.113]  Like, some average cop, you're going to blame them?
[00:38:52.133 --> 00:38:52.953]  Like, they're out to get you?
[00:38:52.973 --> 00:38:54.134]  That's the craziest crap I ever saw.
[00:38:55.962 --> 00:39:05.528]  I literally thought we'd just go cover this Communist Black Lives Matter meeting, which is in Carl... Charles Dicks and all these other guys.
[00:39:06.088 --> 00:39:08.570]  Yeah, Cornel West, the big socialist.
[00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:14.153]  I thought we would just go cover this and that literally it would be okay, but now I realize it is so charged.
[00:39:14.193 --> 00:39:21.778]  Dead cops in Baton Rouge, dead cops in Dallas, dead cops in Philadelphia, dead cops in every city, Islamic attacks.
[00:39:22.398 --> 00:39:23.679]  I've seen Islamists out here.
[00:39:23.759 --> 00:39:27.962]  I mean, these people really think this is their time to overthrow America, because Obama is encouraging it.
[00:39:28.542 --> 00:39:31.764]  If you overthrow any cities, it'll just make the stock market plunge.
[00:39:32.025 --> 00:39:32.885]  You'll be out of jobs.
[00:39:32.965 --> 00:39:35.587]  It's like, it is the takedown of this country.
[00:39:35.607 --> 00:39:39.110]  But all I want to get out there is, the leftists are putting out tweets that I attacked the police.
[00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:40.671]  They would have arrested me if I did that.
[00:39:40.931 --> 00:39:43.092]  They realized I was pushing through some people attacking me.
[00:39:43.492 --> 00:39:44.793]  The police chief grabbed my arm.
[00:39:45.194 --> 00:39:45.734]  What's the luck?
[00:39:46.274 --> 00:39:47.375]  Other police explained what happened.
[00:39:48.776 --> 00:39:49.437]  They protected me.
[00:39:50.357 --> 00:39:50.658]  And feces.
[00:40:08.098 --> 00:40:10.258]  So, Kevin is an off-duty police officer.
[00:40:10.298 --> 00:40:10.778]  He was there.
[00:40:10.798 --> 00:40:15.539]  He actually protected us, and later we talked to him, so he served with us a few blocks from where this happened.
[00:40:16.099 --> 00:40:17.840]  Kevin, we haven't scripted what we're talking about here.
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.960]  That's my perspective of what happened, but I was only seeing what I saw.
[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:21.720]  What did you see?
[00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:22.221]  Come on in, guys.
[00:40:22.241 --> 00:40:22.581]  Talk to him.
[00:40:23.161 --> 00:40:32.342]  Well, after you were talking, there was two gentlemen of the Communist Party that came in and basically attacked Alex.
[00:40:32.922 --> 00:40:34.163]  Alex had to push them back.
[00:40:34.243 --> 00:40:35.183]  He lost his balance.
[00:40:36.603 --> 00:40:44.170]  I went into the police chief and I secured the individuals that were attacking Alex.
[00:40:44.991 --> 00:40:50.136]  The one kid was coming over my head to try and punch Alex.
[00:40:50.736 --> 00:40:58.363]  At that point it was a real safety issue and we had to scoot out of there real fast because it was getting extremely volatile and dangerous.
[00:41:01.141 --> 00:41:02.342]  What is it like for you to see this?
[00:41:02.382 --> 00:41:03.643]  I mean, I've never seen anything like this.
[00:41:03.703 --> 00:41:04.443]  I didn't expect this.
[00:41:04.923 --> 00:41:07.665]  Well, I mean, it's sad.
[00:41:08.346 --> 00:41:13.849]  It's very sad to watch, you know, the fabric of our values and our Constitution
[00:41:15.936 --> 00:41:23.322]  And, you know, these kids that have the free speech, it's there because we're Americans.
[00:41:23.582 --> 00:41:24.243]  People paid for it.
[00:41:24.503 --> 00:41:25.044]  Exactly.
[00:41:25.244 --> 00:41:32.370]  And, you know, when you're hearing kids saying, you know, we hate the country, they're stepping on our flag.
[00:41:33.325 --> 00:41:37.969]  You know, as a true American and a patriot, it hurts your heart to watch that.
[00:41:38.869 --> 00:41:42.412]  Oh, I forgot, they were also burning American flags today.
[00:41:42.432 --> 00:41:43.893]  Thank you for protecting me.
[00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:45.555]  I had no idea how dangerous it was.
[00:41:45.695 --> 00:41:46.956]  I appreciate you being there.
[00:41:47.056 --> 00:41:50.299]  I was really surprised how fast the state police got me out of there.
[00:41:53.129 --> 00:41:55.792]  Jakari Jackson coming to you here with a news blitz.
[00:41:55.812 --> 00:41:57.374]  We have a few articles about police.
[00:41:57.634 --> 00:42:00.117]  We're going to get started with this one right here in the state of Texas.
[00:42:00.457 --> 00:42:01.859]  This is Governor Greg Abbott.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.003]  Targeted killings of police should be a hate crime.
[00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:07.646]  Abbott announced Monday his plan to lobby
[00:42:08.286 --> 00:42:12.128]  Now, I can understand why Abbott wants this and I can also see potential problems with it.
[00:42:12.168 --> 00:42:13.489]  First, let's talk about why he wants this.
[00:42:29.336 --> 00:42:38.899]  Just in my short time here in the state of Texas and even during Abbott's administration, there have been some many, many high-profile attacks on police officers.
[00:42:38.919 --> 00:42:48.122]  Of course, we know the ones that happened in Dallas, not just the most recent one, but also there's one a year or so before where the Dallas police station itself was attacked.
[00:42:48.202 --> 00:42:49.002]  A guy came in his
[00:42:49.662 --> 00:42:54.663]  What the media referred to as a zombie apocalypse van opened fire on the police station.
[00:42:54.723 --> 00:42:56.364]  Also a car that's parked down the street.
[00:42:56.724 --> 00:42:58.084]  Myself and Joe Biggs, we covered that.
[00:42:58.104 --> 00:43:04.085]  We actually got to walk through the crime scene while the FBI was there still picking up shell casings, taking pictures and all the stuff.
[00:43:04.466 --> 00:43:06.606]  So with that in mind, I can understand that.
[00:43:06.766 --> 00:43:10.007]  Also right here in Austin, Texas where Abbott is, where the
[00:43:10.567 --> 00:43:10.927]  I don't know.
[00:43:30.653 --> 00:43:42.604]  Those windows that were busted out because I just remember driving down 35 that's where the police station is just right off 35 and for months and months the windows were shot out at the police station as a steady reminder that it had been attacked.
[00:43:42.624 --> 00:43:48.529]  So I can understand why Abbott wants this and I'm sure he has many police officers who will back him up on that.
[00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:53.934]  I'm not saying it's a bad thing but my concern is that it may overextend.
[00:43:54.014 --> 00:43:56.937]  Once again this is legislation that hasn't been written so I'm just
[00:43:56.937 --> 00:43:59.803]  I'm just afraid that it may be a little too all-consuming.
[00:44:00.525 --> 00:44:03.451]  Case in point, there's a situation a couple years ago.
[00:44:04.366 --> 00:44:11.108]  Where an officer, where officers, they were doing a raid on a man's house and the guy thought somebody was breaking into his house.
[00:44:11.148 --> 00:44:14.270]  He pulled out his gun and he shot one of the officers who was entering.
[00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:15.870]  You know, it's pitch black in the middle of the night.
[00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:16.870]  He didn't know who it was.
[00:44:17.211 --> 00:44:25.894]  So that's my only concern is that it may be too broad and maybe that guy would have been charged with a hate crime if this had been retroactive at the time.
[00:44:25.974 --> 00:44:29.575]  So if they can get issues like that, I doubt I'd be a lot more
[00:44:30.235 --> 00:44:30.976]  We're good to go.
[00:44:47.405 --> 00:45:00.274]  In a memo sent to employees last week, Butler County Sheriff Richard Jones urged civilian employees and volunteers to carry their weapons at the Sheriff's Office while operating any department vehicle.
[00:45:00.614 --> 00:45:16.505]  Because when you consider the high-profile slayings of police officers, whether it's recently in Baton Rouge or a couple years ago in New York, where you had people who were sitting in their cars and they were approached from behind and had somebody shoot at them, it's a very scary situation, especially when you have your civilian staff.
[00:45:17.185 --> 00:45:24.049]  Really, all officers are civilian staff, but the guys who don't normally carry a pistol on their hip, do you want them to be armed as well?
[00:45:24.089 --> 00:45:30.373]  Because they could be driving a department vehicle out, whatever they're doing, pumping their gas and get shot in the back of the head.
[00:45:30.634 --> 00:45:35.277]  So he at least wants his officers or his civilian staff to have a means to protect themselves.
[00:45:35.457 --> 00:45:42.081]  Now, briefly, we're going to touch on some international news and talk about an axe attack that happened in Germany and several people were injured.
[00:45:42.561 --> 00:45:43.081]  We're good to go!
[00:46:08.394 --> 00:46:09.394]  We're good to go.
[00:46:27.407 --> 00:46:29.929]  So that's my thing with that.
[00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:36.013]  Of course, it's German, so it's not so much a Second Amendment issue, but just a armed person issue in general.
[00:46:36.414 --> 00:46:45.980]  And also talking about the attacker, they say, though a pro-ISIS group had claimed responsibility, they say that he's not officially linked to any terror group.
[00:46:46.021 --> 00:46:47.482]  So it's like many things.
[00:46:47.522 --> 00:46:53.266]  People may claim responsibility for it, or they may be happy that it happened, but it doesn't mean that the person that necessarily
[00:46:54.027 --> 00:46:55.973]  In cahoots with that organization.
[00:46:56.375 --> 00:46:57.438]  So that's it for right now.
[00:46:57.719 --> 00:46:59.404]  More reports on InfoWars.com

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.244 --> 00:48:52.725]  I don't know.
[00:49:08.024 --> 00:49:15.608]  Recently, CNN's Don Lemon sparred with constitutional champion Sheriff Clark over the exploding war on police.
[00:49:15.808 --> 00:49:16.869]  Let me ask you this.
[00:49:17.469 --> 00:49:23.232]  Do we know that generally the American law enforcement officers are racist?
[00:49:23.492 --> 00:49:24.192]  Do we know this?
[00:49:24.653 --> 00:49:29.315]  First of all, this whole anti-police rhetoric is based on a lie.
[00:49:29.495 --> 00:49:34.998]  There is no data, and you know this, that law enforcement officers treat black
[00:49:35.619 --> 00:49:39.271]  There is data that's important.
[00:49:39.291 --> 00:49:40.335]  There is not data.
[00:49:42.847 --> 00:49:43.167]  I don't know.
[00:50:06.724 --> 00:50:10.245]  We want you to know that our hearts are out there marching with them.
[00:50:10.705 --> 00:50:16.847]  Here at CNN, a panel of commentators moved by the protests put their own hands up after the grand jury decision.
[00:50:17.067 --> 00:50:19.787]  And that intent is becoming more and more apparent.
[00:50:20.007 --> 00:50:25.869]  Comedian and actor Kevin Hart recently pleaded with other celebrities to speak out on his Instagram.
[00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:38.553]  Heart wrote, I'm asking that my other fellow celebrity friends, entertainers, producers, writers, directors, athletes, all take a day out of your schedule to simply talk and try to come up with a solution.
[00:50:38.773 --> 00:50:41.674]  I don't want to see a war in any way shape or form.
[00:50:41.994 --> 00:50:43.234]  I want to see change.
[00:50:43.614 --> 00:50:46.315]  I want to see the justice system change.
[00:50:46.695 --> 00:50:49.536]  I want to see people walk the streets without fear.
[00:50:49.796 --> 00:50:51.917]  The changes have to come from the top.
[00:50:52.037 --> 00:50:53.317]  We can do better people.
[00:50:53.677 --> 00:50:56.118]  Don't let the media force a race war.
[00:50:56.378 --> 00:51:00.039]  Rapper Joey Badass echoed Hart's logic when he wrote,
[00:51:00.279 --> 00:51:05.083]  What the government is doing amongst our people is downright disturbing, but not surprising.
[00:51:05.363 --> 00:51:12.848]  With all of the conflict and propaganda, I believe they are simply trying to start a civil war within the USA amongst black and white.
[00:51:13.049 --> 00:51:24.197]  They're simply pushing us to our limit so that we can all get together and rebel so that it makes it easier for them to kill us, black people mostly, and anyone who acts out against them.
[00:51:24.597 --> 00:51:31.779]  Recently, Obama took a blowtorch to the raging inferno of the growing divide spiraling out of control in the United States.
[00:51:32.059 --> 00:51:37.320]  As Town Hall reports, predictably, Obama fanned the flames, calling on the U.S.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:52.243]  to do better, and said that the controversial incidents arising from the police use of force were not isolated incidents, but rather were symptomatic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system.
[00:51:52.523 --> 00:52:02.147]  He continued, When incidents like this occur, there's a big chunk of our citizenry that feels as if, because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same.
[00:52:02.347 --> 00:52:04.708]  And that hurts, and that should trouble all of us.
[00:52:05.028 --> 00:52:10.230]  Ted Nugent, the Motor City madman, responded to Obama's race war cheerleading.
[00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:13.732]  Nugent writes, The evil man is doing this on purpose.
[00:52:14.052 --> 00:52:16.654]  He wants a race war, but we will not give him one.
[00:52:16.954 --> 00:52:23.799]  Obama will go down in history as a maniac, America-hating freak with his fundamental transformation scam.
[00:52:24.099 --> 00:52:30.263]  And if you still think only black people are being shot by police, well... When police kill, should they judge themselves?
[00:52:30.283 --> 00:52:37.388]  A police officer had taken a gun, put it right to his temple, and fired a fatal shot in the backyard here, in front of his mother and his sister.
[00:52:37.768 --> 00:52:43.451]  He was grabbing Michael by the neck and he grabbed him by the shoulder and within a couple seconds they took him off camera.
[00:52:43.531 --> 00:52:46.812]  Police and county investigations declared the shooting justified.
[00:52:47.333 --> 00:52:54.356]  Within two days before the crime lab report, before the autopsy were complete, they had cleared themselves of any wrongdoing.
[00:52:55.552 --> 00:52:57.613]  This is video taken by a passerby.
[00:52:58.053 --> 00:52:59.273]  Dylan has been shot.
[00:52:59.453 --> 00:53:04.635]  Police won't say if Dylan had a weapon, but his brother and cousin say he emphatically did not.
[00:53:04.755 --> 00:53:06.416]  Had his headphones in, you couldn't hear nothing.
[00:53:06.576 --> 00:53:07.576]  And they finally surrounded him.
[00:53:07.757 --> 00:53:10.558]  They were like, get on the ground, I'm gonna pull up his pants.
[00:53:10.578 --> 00:53:12.918]  And they shot him.
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:19.701]  Arms out to the side.
[00:53:19.721 --> 00:53:22.242]  Are you all... I don't have a weapon.
[00:53:23.567 --> 00:53:23.808]  Hey!
[00:53:24.008 --> 00:53:25.630]  You can't do that!
[00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:27.232]  Get your hands behind your back!
[00:53:27.252 --> 00:53:28.093]  You're under arrest!
[00:53:28.113 --> 00:53:28.894]  You can't do that!
[00:53:29.295 --> 00:53:30.977]  Get your hands behind your back!
[00:53:31.278 --> 00:53:32.299]  Officer, what are you doing?
[00:53:32.319 --> 00:53:33.581]  Get your hands behind your back!
[00:53:33.601 --> 00:53:34.001]  You're under arrest!
[00:53:34.021 --> 00:53:34.242]  Officer!
[00:53:39.278 --> 00:53:40.899]  He was lying in bed.
[00:53:41.419 --> 00:53:42.600]  He wasn't reaching for a weapon.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:48.383]  Two people barged into his room and 10 seconds later were unloading 16 bullets into his body.
[00:53:48.683 --> 00:53:53.986]  The shooters were Department of Corrections Officer Chris Rongan and King County Deputy Aaron Thompson.
[00:53:54.586 --> 00:54:04.072]  They'd arrested a parole violator at this Auburn house, but surprised Theo Harris in bed, shooting him when they mistakenly thought he was reaching for a gun.
[00:54:04.152 --> 00:54:05.332]  Get your hands out!
[00:54:06.033 --> 00:54:07.894]  Get your... Get them out!
[00:54:08.735 --> 00:54:10.558]  Yeah, there's a race war, alright.
[00:54:10.938 --> 00:54:17.888]  A war on the human race, by random trigger-happy police that our justice systems rarely prosecute.
[00:54:18.049 --> 00:54:23.617]  But it still doesn't mean all police are capable of committing the same heinous criminal acts.
[00:54:23.957 --> 00:54:24.918]  You want to solve this?
[00:54:25.379 --> 00:54:28.402]  Take a unified stance against the justice system.
[00:54:28.643 --> 00:54:32.126]  More murderous cops in jail means more accountability.
[00:54:32.447 --> 00:54:40.656]  Meanwhile, the last remaining officer, Lieutenant Brian Rice, on trial for the death of Freddie Gray after not securing Gray's seatbelt, walks.
[00:54:41.092 --> 00:54:47.574]  Wouldn't it serve the establishment's race war agenda to have those police responsible for Freddie Gray's death to go free?
[00:54:47.894 --> 00:54:53.736]  Cannon fodder for a race war hyped by the globalist mouthpieces over at the mainstream media?
[00:54:54.016 --> 00:55:03.199]  Perhaps maybe we should all just repeat what the globalists have been whispering among themselves for decades in order to sober up and face the truth.
[00:55:03.579 --> 00:55:21.127]  The seeping soft war on humanity we are all faced with, waged by corporatized eugenics programs, expresses the elitist sentiment that no lives matter, except for those of the elite, because full-scale eugenics programs are all around you.
[00:55:21.547 --> 00:55:32.072]  Utilizing a monopolized handful of media conglomerates to generate fear and disinformation, all for the sake of pitting us all against each other, no lives matter.
[00:55:32.492 --> 00:55:41.643]  Think about it, George Soros-backed Black Lives Matter protesters, while you block traffic, putting your life and everyone else's in jeopardy.
[00:55:42.023 --> 00:55:43.966]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:55:53.387 --> 00:55:57.928]  Alright, Kid Daniels here with Infowars.com at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio.
[00:55:57.988 --> 00:55:59.668]  And this is what they call Media Row.
[00:55:59.688 --> 00:56:07.970]  It's where all the mainstream media reporters get together and type up their headlines against Trump and distort reality.
[00:56:08.770 --> 00:56:10.190]  Let's just walk through here and take a look.
[00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:16.771]  This is such a ridiculous maze of people.
[00:56:16.791 --> 00:56:19.892]  Let's see what we've got.
[00:56:20.765 --> 00:56:21.345]  BBC.
[00:56:21.625 --> 00:56:22.405]  Oh, BBC.
[00:56:23.245 --> 00:56:24.646]  Get your propaganda there.
[00:56:25.546 --> 00:56:27.446]  Your anti-Brexit propaganda.
[00:56:27.466 --> 00:56:32.927]  Let's see.
[00:56:33.647 --> 00:56:36.228]  Yeah, selfie sticks are getting very popular in media.
[00:56:39.148 --> 00:56:39.868]  The Daily Signal.
[00:56:39.948 --> 00:56:41.228]  Oh, they're actually not bad.
[00:56:43.209 --> 00:56:44.689]  They actually broke a lot of good stories.
[00:56:45.889 --> 00:56:50.230]  I think they have the Cheryl Atkinson stories about the media manipulation.
[00:56:52.526 --> 00:56:53.086]  So they're good.
[00:56:55.909 --> 00:56:59.932]  So you got a reporter right there about to go in there.
[00:56:59.952 --> 00:57:02.294]  Getting his makeup.
[00:57:04.876 --> 00:57:05.937]  See, walking here.
[00:57:08.359 --> 00:57:09.019]  Politico.
[00:57:11.601 --> 00:57:13.443]  The booth is just as empty as their stories.
[00:57:17.677 --> 00:57:18.637]  See, radio.
[00:57:18.978 --> 00:57:22.979]  Yeah, I think I started at the radio wing of the building.
[00:57:23.999 --> 00:57:25.320]  Let's keep walking through here.
[00:57:27.881 --> 00:57:28.841]  Oh, catering.
[00:57:28.981 --> 00:57:29.481]  Oh, wow.
[00:57:32.322 --> 00:57:33.223]  CBS radio.
[00:57:34.223 --> 00:57:38.065]  Yeah, got the microcosm of their audience size, probably.
[00:57:43.146 --> 00:57:44.407]  Oh, here's the trendy section.
[00:57:46.561 --> 00:57:55.906]  Yeah, so when we first walked in, Josh Owens, Wayne Madsen, and I, we went through here, this area first.
[00:57:57.326 --> 00:57:59.207]  And it's, yeah, this is like Trendy Zone.
[00:58:02.289 --> 00:58:03.289]  The millennial media.
[00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:05.771]  Yeah, like, just Skype.
[00:58:06.191 --> 00:58:07.632]  Oh yeah, yeah, here's Snapchat.
[00:58:07.832 --> 00:58:10.013]  It's like the first booth that you see when you walk in here.
[00:58:11.843 --> 00:58:12.763]  It's a Snapchat booth.
[00:58:12.783 --> 00:58:14.204]  This is media.
[00:58:14.704 --> 00:58:15.645]  It's a Snapchat booth.
[00:58:18.986 --> 00:58:20.587]  So let's just continue our journey here.
[00:58:23.889 --> 00:58:33.773]  But yeah, if you ever wondered why all the mainstream media has such the same narrative, especially the anti-Trump narrative, it's because they can just come in here and sit on the couch and conspire.
[00:58:34.653 --> 00:58:37.735]  I'm not saying those people are conspiring, but you know, you get my point.
[00:58:40.353 --> 00:58:42.534]  Alright folks, that's going to do it for tonight's broadcast.
[00:58:42.614 --> 00:58:47.697]  InfoWars Nightly News will return, Lord willing, tomorrow evening, 7 o'clock p.m.
[00:58:47.937 --> 00:58:48.797]  Central Time.
[00:58:49.378 --> 00:58:53.840]  Don't forget to subscribe to the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:56.601]  We'll see you guys back here tomorrow night.
[00:58:57.962 --> 00:58:58.182]  See ya.
[00:59:03.772 --> 00:59:05.133]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:59:05.413 --> 00:59:06.713]  You can't survive without it.
[00:59:06.894 --> 00:59:07.814]  But where do you get it?
[00:59:08.094 --> 00:59:13.857]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:59:14.097 --> 00:59:19.820]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:36.882]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
