[00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.672]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:24.114]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:24.514 --> 00:00:26.157]  It is May 11, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.651]  Tonight, it's not just the economy, stupid.
[00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:36.992]  It's the deliberate sabotage of the economy.
[00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:41.615]  Hillary gets only a third of the votes she did eight years ago, as she loses badly to Bernie Sanders.
[00:00:41.815 --> 00:00:45.336]  And half of Sanders voters say they would vote for Trump over Hillary.
[00:00:45.737 --> 00:00:48.918]  And, we look at one example of human trafficking and slavery.
[00:00:49.378 --> 00:00:54.341]  Vietnamese girls as young as 13 kidnapped and sold to Chinese men as brides.
[00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:58.443]  I was propagandized as a kid to believe that everything America did was great.
[00:00:58.763 --> 00:01:03.626]  And like a lot of people, as I got into the world in the 70s and 80s, I realized that wasn't true.
[00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:09.309]  But I do believe America is better than any other political and social system that's ever been created in the world.
[00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.531]  So, I don't care what your trendy argument, I don't care what your hashtag argument is.
[00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:16.893]  If you do not stand for free speech, you do not stand for America.
[00:01:17.493 --> 00:01:20.135]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:00.387 --> 00:03:01.955]  Yeah.
[00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:04.429]  And welcome back.
[00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:15.492]  West Virginia is feeling the burn, and we see that Mr. Sanders has toppled Mrs. Clinton in a state that she won back in 2008, notching another victory to keep him on the path to the nomination.
[00:03:15.952 --> 00:03:22.114]  With 61% of precincts reporting Tuesday evening, Sanders led Clinton 51% to 36%.
[00:03:23.514 --> 00:03:30.416]  And also, with Sanders' projected victory, he's slated to win the majority of the 29 pledged delegates at stake.
[00:03:30.996 --> 00:03:35.581]  Now it's going to be a very narrow window, but Bernie is still in this thing.
[00:03:35.941 --> 00:03:42.167]  And for all you Sanders supporters out there, you are doing somewhat of a good job trying to get Bernie out there in the limelight.
[00:03:42.227 --> 00:03:47.332]  He lost a lot of esteem just due to the superdelegate process.
[00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:50.536]  And I'm not a Sanders supporter, but I do want him to have a fair shake.
[00:03:50.976 --> 00:03:55.457]  In this election cycle, so good job to you guys keeping him out there and not letting Ms.
[00:03:55.497 --> 00:03:59.238]  Clinton just come in and take all the delegates with the superdelegate process.
[00:03:59.298 --> 00:04:08.679]  I mean, before even Sanders gets to the states and the voters get to the polls, the delegates are already sucked up during the superdelegate process, so we'll see how much longer he can hold on.
[00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:16.061]  Now, in other political news, we see that Obama's speechwriters are actually laughing about the American people believing Obama's lies.
[00:04:16.101 --> 00:04:17.581]  They sit around here and they talk about
[00:04:17.961 --> 00:04:25.703]  Hey, Bob, you know, it's great when you wrote that line about this or that, and here's a clip of this, of these guys talking about all the lies they put into Obama's speeches.
[00:04:26.924 --> 00:04:32.966]  The point is that you have equal impact on serious speeches because it's about style, use of language, etc.
[00:04:33.946 --> 00:04:41.688]  I really like... I was very... The joke speech is the most fun part of this, but the things I'm the most proud of were the more serious speeches, I think.
[00:04:42.068 --> 00:04:47.190]  Healthcare, economic speeches, and I think... Love it wrote the line about...
[00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:55.558]  If you like your insurance, you can keep it.
[00:04:56.359 --> 00:05:06.448]  And now, while they may be laughing it up and having a good time, we have a story here that is no laughing matter, and that is Vietnamese girls being smuggled into China and sold as child brides.
[00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:12.274]  The villages along the Vietnamese-Chinese border are a hunting ground for human traffickers.
[00:05:13.114 --> 00:05:30.586]  And this is for all the people who say that overpopulation is a big issue.
[00:05:30.626 --> 00:05:40.653]  Now, I do understand that you do have some cities where that's an issue, like New York, Mumbai, or other places where, you know, we go down the street the wrong part of the day or the right part of the day, where it may be, you can't even walk down the street.
[00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:42.334]  It's like being at Disneyland or something.
[00:05:42.554 --> 00:05:43.076]  We're good to go.
[00:05:46.698 --> 00:05:46.898]  I think?
[00:06:17.198 --> 00:06:17.659]  We're good to go.
[00:06:39.693 --> 00:07:07.477]  Societal means to help people take care of the children that they do have so it doesn't become a burden on Anybody else now as we're talking about the serious news it continues with a blast from Isis they've come out and attacked an Iraqi city Baghdad and we see that Isis says it's behind a series of attacks in Iraqis capital Wednesday that targeted Shiites and left more than 90 people dead at least 64 people were killed when a car bomb went off in a market at Baghdad according to
[00:07:08.217 --> 00:07:22.380]  And this is the old adage, you guys probably heard it, you take a drug dealer off the street and next week there's another drug dealer to replace them.
[00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:32.303]  It's the same thing when you take these dictators, as bad as they may be, out of these places where you talk about Gaddafi or Saddam or what they're trying to do in Syria with Assad.
[00:07:33.143 --> 00:07:44.270]  When you remove these guys from power, just like we've seen in Libya, all you do is create a breeding ground, a battleground, and the group that eventually takes over, it just becomes an ISIS training camp, or a terrorist training camp.
[00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.631]  It's the same principle when you talk about the drug dealers.
[00:07:46.771 --> 00:07:54.596]  If you're going to remove somebody from power, regardless of how bad they may be, you need to have some type of structure, some type of reform ready before you go and do that.
[00:07:54.636 --> 00:07:59.599]  You can't just take them out, cut off the head of the snake, and hope that no other snakes come into the area.
[00:07:59.619 --> 00:08:00.880]  That's always going to happen.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:08.285]  And finally tonight, I'm not your typical grandma, and this is a 81-year-old woman who shot and killed an intruder.
[00:08:09.646 --> 00:08:17.812]  You know, never in my whole life did I ever anticipate having to take another life, especially at age 80.
[00:08:18.192 --> 00:08:19.373]  Give me a break here.
[00:08:19.573 --> 00:08:25.598]  But it's something Barb says she'd do again in a heartbeat to defend the family she loves.
[00:08:26.398 --> 00:08:28.420]  I felt like if I hadn't,
[00:08:29.961 --> 00:08:34.882]  My son and I both might be dead, and my husband would have probably bled to death on the kitchen floor.
[00:08:36.042 --> 00:08:38.823]  And that's why you need a Second Amendment in this country.
[00:08:38.883 --> 00:08:47.725]  It is the great equalizer, so you can defend yourself against multiple attackers, people who have weapons, even if you are, in her case, a little more frail, being 80 years old.
[00:08:48.045 --> 00:08:48.945]  So stay tuned after this.
[00:08:48.965 --> 00:08:53.826]  We'll have more special reports, special report from Jon Bound, and also the extended interview with Billy Corgan.
[00:08:55.595 --> 00:09:04.327]  This is what the residents of London have come to expect from the million-plus Muslims now living in areas they no longer feel safe living in or even visiting.
[00:09:04.587 --> 00:09:11.958]  This area here used to be inhabited by the indigenous people of Burnley, which would be British.
[00:09:12.358 --> 00:09:23.004]  They're moving to our community, and as you say, crime rate goes, sex, they're out wanting our girls, you're walking down the road at night time and you're getting stopped, how much love and all that.
[00:09:23.024 --> 00:09:24.685]  We can't come out after dark, can we?
[00:09:24.885 --> 00:09:25.485]  No, my daughter!
[00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:27.427]  And the kids bully our kids.
[00:09:27.807 --> 00:09:28.047]  Yeah.
[00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:31.869]  Like, they all team up on our kids, so our kids can't play out, they've got to be in all the time.
[00:09:31.889 --> 00:09:33.210]  Do you know what I'm talking about, James?
[00:09:33.874 --> 00:09:39.097]  But this area was once a working class British community and now it resembles Bangladesh.
[00:09:39.157 --> 00:09:40.758]  Rise up and say enough is enough.
[00:09:41.218 --> 00:09:42.179]  This is our country.
[00:09:42.259 --> 00:09:44.601]  We don't want any more coming into this country.
[00:09:44.621 --> 00:09:46.582]  We don't want any more immigration.
[00:09:47.002 --> 00:09:49.403]  I just got told to leave.
[00:09:49.744 --> 00:09:50.824]  You run the country?
[00:09:51.465 --> 00:09:52.625]  You run the country, do ya?
[00:09:52.705 --> 00:09:55.007]  I don't want to embarrass you in front of your community.
[00:09:56.178 --> 00:09:57.199]  Is that the best you've got?
[00:09:57.679 --> 00:09:58.140]  Britain!
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.201]  Go back to the desert!
[00:09:59.441 --> 00:10:00.502]  Go back to the desert!
[00:10:00.522 --> 00:10:01.062]  This is Britain!
[00:10:01.082 --> 00:10:02.244]  We've got every right to be here!
[00:10:02.264 --> 00:10:03.144]  Go back to the desert!
[00:10:03.164 --> 00:10:03.565]  Go on!
[00:10:03.685 --> 00:10:03.985]  Stop it!
[00:10:04.225 --> 00:10:05.046]  For what?
[00:10:05.166 --> 00:10:05.386]  What?
[00:10:05.406 --> 00:10:06.227]  This is our country!
[00:10:06.247 --> 00:10:07.348]  Why don't you go back to your own country?
[00:10:07.368 --> 00:10:07.849]  This is Britain!
[00:10:07.869 --> 00:10:09.050]  Are you telling us to stop?
[00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.790]  Shut up!
[00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.172]  Who are you talking to?
[00:10:26.513 --> 00:10:30.576]  No Muslim out there.
[00:10:31.017 --> 00:10:33.419]  All that evil you see on the streets.
[00:10:33.819 --> 00:10:35.901]  People not wearing hijab properly.
[00:10:35.921 --> 00:10:37.602]  People smoking.
[00:10:37.682 --> 00:10:42.266]  People walking like they've got something stuck in their pants.
[00:10:42.306 --> 00:10:44.447]  This kind of thing.
[00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:47.192]  They should hate walking down that street.
[00:10:47.552 --> 00:10:53.955]  This poster is basically showing how we will transform Buckingham Palace into a local mosque for the Muslims.
[00:10:54.255 --> 00:10:56.677]  Drugs will be banned, pornography will be banned, gambling will be banned.
[00:10:56.877 --> 00:11:06.922]  We do expect to enter into a struggle, if you like, of words, and maybe even more than that, before we can see the fruition of the Sharia, really, on state level.
[00:11:07.222 --> 00:11:08.802]  Muslims are here to stay!
[00:11:08.842 --> 00:11:10.383]  Muslims are here to stay!
[00:11:10.483 --> 00:11:15.204]  These people coming to our country, setting up their own legal system, enough is enough.
[00:11:15.284 --> 00:11:25.687]  But none of the evidence of internal malice towards the United Kingdom's host population by a growing Muslim population even exists according to London's new Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan.
[00:11:25.967 --> 00:11:28.768]  In fact, Khan, a Labour Party favourite,
[00:11:28.868 --> 00:11:29.108]  I think so.
[00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:54.058]  Passing out blinders to the general population.
[00:11:54.238 --> 00:12:01.283]  In fact, Khan, barely a week into his role as London's mayor, is hurling veiled threats at the United States.
[00:12:01.543 --> 00:12:12.130]  His claim that Donald Trump's stance on Muslims is based in ignorance and that Trump's continued rhetoric will only lead to more attacks is a foolish statement to begin with.
[00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:12.931]  Hello?
[00:12:13.311 --> 00:12:18.895]  If Trump is ignorant on Muslim aggression being a reality, then why should we expect attacks?
[00:12:19.435 --> 00:12:30.741]  Khan has spoken at numerous events right alongside jihadists, including, as The Sun reported, a rally in 2006 with an extremist Muslim leader who threatened fire throughout the world.
[00:12:30.921 --> 00:12:39.225]  Sadiq Khan later defended Dr. Azam Tamimi, a senior figure in the Muslim Association of Britain, for using flowery language.
[00:12:39.585 --> 00:12:56.606]  London Mayor Sadiq Khan will be traveling to the United States and meeting with other globalist tool mayors like Chicago's Rahm Emanuel and New York City's Bill de Blasio because it's vitally important to establish a network of global tyranny in the will of the multinational corporations on the local level.
[00:12:56.886 --> 00:13:03.128]  Mayor Kahn, the people of the United States don't intend on committing our sovereignty to the trash bin of history.
[00:13:03.288 --> 00:13:14.213]  Your feigned ignorance of the true state of the refugee invasion preying on innocent Europeans and Americans is just as blatantly false as your mayoral campaign.
[00:13:14.413 --> 00:13:16.373]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[00:13:26.051 --> 00:13:26.432]  We're good.
[00:13:35.834 --> 00:13:37.775]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:13:37.815 --> 00:13:39.596]  This is a very special report.
[00:13:39.816 --> 00:13:47.080]  Joining me in studio now is musical icon and great patriot Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins fame.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:55.224]  Now you've obviously sold millions of records, you're back on the road, and now you are joining us here in our new studio here in Austin, Texas.
[00:13:55.264 --> 00:13:55.844]  Welcome back.
[00:13:55.964 --> 00:13:57.585]  But this is the new, old news for you.
[00:13:57.605 --> 00:13:57.805]  Yes.
[00:13:58.266 --> 00:14:01.928]  Yeah, all the fans out there, all of your support helped to build this place.
[00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:04.770]  It's no longer a deep, dark cave of sadness.
[00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.331]  It actually feels welcoming.
[00:14:06.391 --> 00:14:08.873]  Where before it was sort of foreboding.
[00:14:09.133 --> 00:14:10.814]  Yes, very much foreboding.
[00:14:10.894 --> 00:14:13.996]  You know, which could be fitting sometimes within the info war.
[00:14:14.717 --> 00:14:23.022]  But so now you were on the Alex Jones Show earlier today and I thought it was just really prescient speaking about breaking people out of this trance.
[00:14:23.582 --> 00:14:25.744]  And, you know, I feel like
[00:14:27.364 --> 00:14:37.208]  We're truly living the Orwellian nightmare and it's almost as if it's been programmed and preparing us for this and the Matrix is here.
[00:14:37.628 --> 00:14:47.211]  Yeah, it's really bizarre to me because I grew up, I was born in 1967 and in school at a very young age we read Animal Farm and we read 1984.
[00:14:47.552 --> 00:14:53.814]  And of course what I took from that is this is never going to happen in America.
[00:14:54.842 --> 00:14:56.223]  I'll take the Constitution test.
[00:14:56.283 --> 00:15:02.828]  So whether I was being propagandized in the positive, I was being informed that America is not like this.
[00:15:03.309 --> 00:15:05.730]  To actually see, in my lifetime,
[00:15:06.744 --> 00:15:12.789]  America go from the world that I believed in then to the world I see now is literally mind-blowing.
[00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:25.360]  And to be participating not only at the citizen level and the local community level, you know I have a business where I live outside of Chicago and so I deal with the local government and that type of stuff.
[00:15:26.021 --> 00:15:45.309]  But then also be a public person and be part of the zeitgeist at different times to be used and abused positively and negatively within the systems that exist today and see how my participation is a constant decision making between either am I helping, am I hurting, am I informing, or am I actually enslaving.
[00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:49.670]  That's a difficult thing to take on.
[00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.832]  Yeah, so to learn that
[00:15:53.732 --> 00:16:01.078]  You know, what the collectivist vision in Animal Farm in 1984 was actually our future and not this preventative thing kind of blows my mind.
[00:16:02.039 --> 00:16:06.102]  I can't believe we're even having this discussion, if you can understand why I say that to you humbly.
[00:16:06.122 --> 00:16:11.067]  To be talking in America in 2016, you know, about, you know,
[00:16:11.807 --> 00:16:17.193]  Mao is a good idea, and a socialist is running for president, and that's okay.
[00:16:17.273 --> 00:16:22.398]  And we're going to go back to these kind of crazy tax rates, where we're going to completely disempower the innovators in our country.
[00:16:23.079 --> 00:16:28.184]  Because the new class, the new technocratic class, wants to keep their position, and they want to keep anybody else from coming in the game.
[00:16:28.204 --> 00:16:29.425]  I mean, that's just crazy to me.
[00:16:29.986 --> 00:16:37.812]  Yeah, how do you think people can get around the millions of people that were murdered under these communist regimes and just say, well, you know, that just happened then.
[00:16:37.992 --> 00:16:51.903]  Here's the thing, you know, obviously I listen to you and I listen to Alex, I listen to David Knight and Chakari, I mean, you guys do a fine job of identifying the factual root and of course sometimes because you don't have all the information you have to speculate.
[00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:55.907]  And as I once told Alex, literally sitting in this exact spot, you don't always have to be right.
[00:16:56.786 --> 00:16:59.151]  You just have to have the right intention to want to get to the truth.
[00:16:59.211 --> 00:17:01.456]  As long as you want to get to the truth and that's your intention, that's fine.
[00:17:01.977 --> 00:17:05.945]  But what I would say to you, and I say this very plainly to you, is that most people don't care about facts.
[00:17:07.611 --> 00:17:08.832]  Most people do not care about facts.
[00:17:09.152 --> 00:17:10.393]  I work in the entertainment business.
[00:17:11.193 --> 00:17:13.235]  The people in the entertainment business do not care about facts.
[00:17:13.455 --> 00:17:15.436]  They only care about facts when it involves a gross.
[00:17:15.936 --> 00:17:16.797]  We spent this much.
[00:17:17.057 --> 00:17:17.718]  How much did we make?
[00:17:17.858 --> 00:17:18.598]  How much did we lose?
[00:17:19.019 --> 00:17:20.940]  Up until that point, it's all in their mind.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.483]  So for most Americans or most people listening internationally, it is in your mind.
[00:17:26.583 --> 00:17:29.645]  Literally, you are fighting phantoms that do not exist.
[00:17:30.486 --> 00:17:34.529]  Now, if you're intelligent, which I think most people that listen to this show are,
[00:17:36.863 --> 00:17:44.867]  You don't see how you've been engineered and steered, and people are heavily invested in convincing you of something.
[00:17:45.047 --> 00:17:46.948]  We all know the advertising model.
[00:17:48.128 --> 00:17:55.371]  Women very much understand, from a very young age, you start being told, you've got to look like this, you've got to think like this, you've got to do this in your hair, blah, blah, blah.
[00:17:55.651 --> 00:18:00.914]  Young men, it comes a little bit later, and it usually comes through sports, which is why it's so heavily invested in sports.
[00:18:01.014 --> 00:18:03.515]  The beard, the culture, the bro, the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:07.172]  Okay, we all understand that, and we don't, it doesn't really bother us.
[00:18:07.832 --> 00:18:12.657]  We like when a clever ad manipulates us to want us to buy a certain product or something.
[00:18:12.877 --> 00:18:18.002]  What we don't realize is, think about people who have trillions on the line getting you to believe a lie.
[00:18:42.486 --> 00:18:43.707]  There is a war.
[00:18:44.187 --> 00:18:45.188]  It's happening now.
[00:18:46.048 --> 00:18:47.869]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.210]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:18:50.991 --> 00:18:52.472]  We are the resistance.
[00:18:52.912 --> 00:18:54.733]  We are the Infowar.
[00:19:04.906 --> 00:19:09.309]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.091]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.773 --> 00:19:15.774]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.435 --> 00:19:27.183]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type 1 civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.854 --> 00:19:39.220]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:50.126]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.
[00:22:47.091 --> 00:22:53.835]  Check out Brain Force today and other game-changing compounds like X2, Survival Shield, at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:54.135 --> 00:22:56.417]  Again, that's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:29.148]  So to me, the next stage in the info war is to get at the ground level, at the cultural level, which is where most people interface with the propagandizing and the manipulation, and help them understand.
[00:23:29.728 --> 00:23:34.951]  Because I think most people's natural human instinct, when they realize they're being manipulated, is to get mad.
[00:23:36.152 --> 00:23:38.073]  Because ultimately it's an insult to their intelligence.
[00:23:38.795 --> 00:23:43.899]  Or to deny, deny, deny, because they don't want to admit that they've been had.
[00:23:44.479 --> 00:23:50.524]  Or disenfranchise their sovereign right to make an independent decision based on fact.
[00:23:52.205 --> 00:23:57.649]  Now, most people don't care, like I said, if they're being manipulated into buying a product.
[00:23:58.652 --> 00:24:06.100]  If they realize that they're ultimately enslaving themselves to a system that's not only going to hurt them, but it's going to hurt their children, that's when their instinct kicks in.
[00:24:06.681 --> 00:24:06.861]  Right.
[00:24:07.021 --> 00:24:08.483]  And that's when fact doesn't matter.
[00:24:08.503 --> 00:24:09.384]  Right?
[00:24:09.824 --> 00:24:12.407]  So, you can present people fact all day.
[00:24:12.568 --> 00:24:14.430]  If they are hypnotized, they are not going to hear you.
[00:24:15.014 --> 00:24:16.875]  They're conditioning your children.
[00:24:17.095 --> 00:24:20.057]  And so you'll see some of these Disney cartoons and things like that.
[00:24:20.097 --> 00:24:34.484]  We spoke about Shutterbug Time, where it's this bug that's a drone that's spying on kids and it's just conditioning them to be completely okay with constant surveillance, reporting back to Central Command about whatever it is that you're doing inside the privacy of your own home.
[00:24:34.504 --> 00:24:35.724]  So let's explore that for a second.
[00:24:36.105 --> 00:24:37.405]  Now I'm on the entertainment side.
[00:24:37.746 --> 00:24:39.046]  I'm in these meetings with people.
[00:24:39.486 --> 00:24:42.428]  I recently had a meeting with the big studio that I might participate in.
[00:24:44.079 --> 00:24:48.686]  Those people at the ground level are not part of some governmental cabal.
[00:24:49.588 --> 00:24:52.673]  They might even themselves be okay with those ideas.
[00:24:53.714 --> 00:24:58.782]  So, on the realm of opinion, somebody working in a big studio could say,
[00:24:59.929 --> 00:25:03.252]  Leanne, I've been friends with the creator of that show for 20 years.
[00:25:03.392 --> 00:25:05.914]  It's got nothing to do with government surveillance, okay?
[00:25:06.034 --> 00:25:07.315]  And you could say, well, I disagree.
[00:25:08.115 --> 00:25:17.002]  So an observer would sit back and say, Leanne has an opinion, and this person over here who's invested in the series and put capital and they believe in it and they love it and they think it's great for children or whatever.
[00:25:17.603 --> 00:25:20.144]  You present it as, have you thought of it like this?
[00:25:20.965 --> 00:25:29.808]  My perspective is, this is something that kind of, if I was a parent or thinking of my own nieces and nephews, this kind of troubles me and here's why.
[00:25:30.688 --> 00:25:46.933]  So all you're doing is you're presenting kind of a range of ideas to someone and letting them make the choice whether or not that's something they want their children participating in because maybe on their particular range of belief, they don't want their children conditioned to believe that surveillance is okay.
[00:25:48.237 --> 00:25:56.040]  Because even if you can make an argument for surveillance is okay, a lot of us that grew up in the 60s and 70s, we were told, don't trust strangers.
[00:25:56.921 --> 00:26:00.142]  Because, you know, there was a rash of a pedophile incident.
[00:26:00.182 --> 00:26:02.243]  I grew up around when John Wayne Gacy was killing kids.
[00:26:02.383 --> 00:26:04.964]  I mean, I literally lived down the road from where that happened.
[00:26:05.484 --> 00:26:08.545]  So you can imagine being 10 years old and hearing about kids being murdered and put in basements.
[00:26:08.565 --> 00:26:09.786]  I mean, it terrified us.
[00:26:10.286 --> 00:26:12.267]  So suddenly all the parents were like, don't trust strangers.
[00:26:13.334 --> 00:26:24.845]  So, something as simple as that, which maybe has no nefarious undertone, still at some point a parent might say, well I don't necessarily want my kid watching that because I don't want them to trust authority blindly.
[00:26:25.365 --> 00:26:26.627]  I want them to use their own minds.
[00:26:27.287 --> 00:26:36.055]  So I'd rather have a show that's more like it's teaching them how to think for themselves and problem solve than I want a show that's telling them it's okay to be observed by a stranger.
[00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:42.373]  And that's not to assign a nefarious intent to the creator, and it's not to say you have to be right.
[00:26:42.813 --> 00:26:53.699]  You can just raise the question, and it's really more about the cultural discussion of whether it's appropriate in the wider culture to accept these ideas as normalized, which is where I get funky on that.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:27:01.930]  I don't like the normalization of things that really need heavy, intense peer and cultural review before we kind of stamp and say, that's okay.
[00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:10.341]  Drones, for example, is something, particularly as a person in public life, and I would guess you as a young woman, that's a troubling thing.
[00:27:10.802 --> 00:27:25.791]  If you have to think, every time you're near an open window and you're taking off or putting on your clothes or you're picking your nose or something, you have to think, is somebody watching me and is this going to end up on a system and is that 10 seconds going to haunt me for the rest of my life, particularly in the social media world where I can be tagged?
[00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:28.113]  And basically you work here, you're a public person.
[00:27:28.393 --> 00:27:29.914]  So those are issues you have to think through.
[00:27:30.314 --> 00:27:34.577]  So why isn't there a greater cultural peer review about
[00:27:35.475 --> 00:27:38.316]  The proper use of drones in situations.
[00:27:38.656 --> 00:27:40.816]  Why isn't there a more wide-ranging discussion?
[00:27:40.836 --> 00:27:42.636]  That, to me, is a discussion we should have as citizens.
[00:27:43.517 --> 00:27:43.717]  Right.
[00:27:43.757 --> 00:27:51.158]  Well, I know, for instance, when I switched over my phone to an Android, not even thinking about it, I didn't realize that you had to turn off all of these systems.
[00:27:51.358 --> 00:27:56.759]  And at one point, I just randomly discovered that my phone had been tracking my most visited places.
[00:27:56.819 --> 00:27:57.840]  And hey, isn't this great?
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.160]  Don't you want everyone to know where you work, where you live, where you shop?
[00:28:02.461 --> 00:28:02.781]  No!
[00:28:02.961 --> 00:28:04.301]  I don't want any... I mean, that's...
[00:28:04.781 --> 00:28:05.561]  It's frightening to me.
[00:28:05.681 --> 00:28:12.464]  At one point I'd linked some social media thing to my phone and as you can imagine I have a lot of famous people in my phone.
[00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:20.108]  And that social media system went in my phone because I downloaded the app and poached all the names and had posted them on the internet.
[00:28:20.968 --> 00:28:24.350]  And I remember talking to somebody from the company and they were like, well those are private.
[00:28:25.413 --> 00:28:26.373]  In the hacking world?
[00:28:26.593 --> 00:28:27.434]  No, exactly.
[00:28:27.474 --> 00:28:27.954]  Hello?
[00:28:28.154 --> 00:28:34.876]  Yeah, it's not private to people who have broken into the government office there in the Pentagon and have exposed your private information.
[00:28:34.936 --> 00:28:35.996]  These are things that we should discuss.
[00:28:36.036 --> 00:28:44.999]  So, I like the idea and I'm pushing for, you know, and I think you're the perfect person to approach this from that systemic review.
[00:28:45.859 --> 00:28:48.762]  From the standpoint of the Infowar, are we okay?
[00:28:49.002 --> 00:28:50.083]  Okay, here's a new show.
[00:28:50.123 --> 00:28:52.025]  Are we comfortable with these concepts?
[00:28:52.386 --> 00:28:57.811]  Here's a movie where, you know, the director of the movie has openly called for open borders.
[00:28:58.272 --> 00:28:59.213]  Are we okay with that?
[00:28:59.733 --> 00:29:01.455]  Are we okay with the messaging in the movie?
[00:29:02.016 --> 00:29:02.576]  Is that okay?
[00:29:02.596 --> 00:29:04.618]  Do we want to participate that on a cultural level?
[00:29:04.798 --> 00:29:05.980]  And I'm not calling for boycotts.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:06.560]  I'm an artist.
[00:29:07.401 --> 00:29:18.729]  I'm calling for an open, free society that deals with these ideas equally and fairly, and that collectively, in the right use of the word, we can come to a better cultural point of view.
[00:29:19.369 --> 00:29:22.832]  I mean, it's pretty remarkable that, like literally, okay, I'm talking to you, right?
[00:29:23.112 --> 00:29:25.473]  I could say one word right now that would destroy my career.
[00:29:25.774 --> 00:29:35.080]  I could use the wrong racial epithet, or say the wrong thing to you, or look down at the wrong part of your body and be castigated, and it's a meme, and I'm a horrible person.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.001]  Every day.
[00:29:36.621 --> 00:29:43.966]  Through the media, through advertising, we see people being degraded, we see people doing all sorts of things that we should be horrified as a culture.
[00:29:44.187 --> 00:29:54.935]  So we've normalized all sorts of things, but now we live in a world where one word can destroy your life, but it's okay to, if you're a social justice warrior, spit in somebody's face.
[00:29:55.395 --> 00:29:55.575]  Right.
[00:29:55.755 --> 00:29:56.276]  That's okay.
[00:29:56.676 --> 00:30:00.479]  Because you have, you've been, you're a victim, so it's okay.
[00:30:00.859 --> 00:30:01.039]  Right.
[00:30:01.199 --> 00:30:05.642]  So under the same ideology, I didn't like the way you spoke to me earlier, so I should be able to
[00:30:06.987 --> 00:30:11.591]  I mean, that's where we're losing the plot, and quickly, too, I would add.
[00:30:11.791 --> 00:30:12.011]  Right.
[00:30:12.151 --> 00:30:21.858]  Well, and that's something that is kind of a big issue right now, is it's this whole cultural, racial thing where you can't say anything if you're white.
[00:30:21.978 --> 00:30:26.802]  There was actually the White Privilege Conference that just took place, the 17th annual one, who knew?
[00:30:28.823 --> 00:30:30.364]  God, I didn't get my invitation this year.
[00:30:30.424 --> 00:30:31.365]  No, I know.
[00:30:31.405 --> 00:30:37.089]  But there was a woman who had attended and she was tweeting out how the white speaker took too long.
[00:30:37.489 --> 00:30:39.111]  I actually did read that.
[00:30:39.171 --> 00:30:42.613]  Perfect example of white privilege even over his time.
[00:30:42.693 --> 00:30:43.694]  That's a perfect example.
[00:30:44.955 --> 00:30:48.397]  I'm the type of person, I saw that report, I was fascinated by it.
[00:30:49.298 --> 00:30:52.980]  I actually went to the woman's Twitter account and I read a bunch of her tweets.
[00:30:53.461 --> 00:30:58.004]  Because as somebody in public life, I know not to just take your word for it.
[00:30:58.184 --> 00:31:00.845]  I wanted to see for myself, what is the messaging?
[00:31:00.885 --> 00:31:01.886]  What is the perspective?
[00:31:02.226 --> 00:31:05.308]  Maybe she said one dumb thing and she said ten things that were really wise.
[00:31:05.548 --> 00:31:06.089]  I want to learn.
[00:31:06.929 --> 00:31:14.655]  So if you can bring that into a wider frame, I think that's very, very helpful to people to encourage investigation and not just take it.
[00:31:14.676 --> 00:31:22.542]  Because at the end of the day, if this is propaganda one and they say you're just propaganda two, then it's always going to be an argument, who's got the moral high ground?
[00:31:22.662 --> 00:31:24.903]  Right, and we definitely see that in the comment section.
[00:31:25.063 --> 00:31:27.244]  That people are like, oh, well this is that, and this, you know.
[00:31:27.264 --> 00:31:30.046]  Leanne, you're a privileged white woman, you have no right to say that.
[00:31:30.446 --> 00:31:44.493]  So, by engaging in the wider topic of free speech, libertarianism, supporting values which you're not, you don't agree with, but at the same time, sort of calling for what it is.
[00:31:44.513 --> 00:31:47.795]  You know, you can engage without having to shut it down.
[00:31:48.214 --> 00:31:51.276]  Right now we have like a whole movement in the youth.
[00:31:51.416 --> 00:31:57.540]  These people truly feel this is their civil rights movement of their time and they feel like they're on the right.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:07.186]  And so if you, for instance, if it's a Trump, anti-Trump rally, they think that people on the Trump side are just racist, homophobic, xenophobic, shut it down.
[00:32:07.206 --> 00:32:13.870]  I don't want to hear anything you say because I'm on the right side of history here and I don't even need to hear your facts.
[00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:15.811]  And so how do you
[00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:23.913]  Kind of educate these people that possibly their ideas aren't authentically individual.
[00:32:23.933 --> 00:32:24.793]  My argument is you can't.
[00:32:25.473 --> 00:32:26.194]  They're too far gone.
[00:32:26.814 --> 00:32:32.016]  And that may sound pessimistic, because I know that you want a solution-based concept.
[00:32:34.097 --> 00:32:43.321]  I think when somebody reaches the point where they literally cannot see a human being on the other side of the argument, and I'm not even talking about religion, okay?
[00:32:43.581 --> 00:32:44.822]  I'm talking about humanism.
[00:33:02.341 --> 00:33:11.543]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important area of InfoWars that runs the whole operation that is having such a big effect against the globalists.
[00:33:12.343 --> 00:33:19.985]  And I've said it over and over again, it is you the listeners and the viewers that send us the intel, the news tips, that support the broadcast, that spread the word.
[00:33:20.885 --> 00:33:23.985]  You are 90% of the operation or more.
[00:33:24.025 --> 00:33:27.146]  You don't stand beside us, you stand at the heart of InfoWars.
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.
[00:33:57.342 --> 00:34:05.626]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when products are sold out, you're unable to get them, sometimes for months, but we hold back the products for people that have already signed up for AutoShip.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:03.459 --> 00:37:11.322]  The law, as it's constructed in Western civilization, is based on the idea that a human has a sort of sovereign right to exist.
[00:37:13.088 --> 00:37:16.470]  And of course people argue about when that life begins, that's a different subject.
[00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:23.435]  But the point is this sovereign right has a vote, they have a life, and they have a right to live it, and then we obviously have a different idea in America.
[00:37:24.095 --> 00:37:31.200]  So when somebody has reached the point where they literally do not see that person as a voice, a vote, and they have a story, and they have a family.
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:35.543]  Look, I've said it before, I grew up around a lot of racists in my family.
[00:37:36.944 --> 00:37:38.084]  Would I call them bad people?
[00:37:38.325 --> 00:37:38.465]  No.
[00:37:38.585 --> 00:37:39.685]  Would I call them misinformed?
[00:37:40.206 --> 00:37:40.346]  Yeah.
[00:37:41.516 --> 00:37:43.257]  Was that due to experience?
[00:37:43.758 --> 00:37:46.720]  Do they have a right to their belief?
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:38:01.250]  They would argue that they had a right to their belief because something happened in 1984 and they had some guy from a different race say something and they were never going to listen to that race again and anything to do... Okay, that's racist as I would define it.
[00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:08.815]  When you reach a point where that person cannot even respect that person across them's path to arrive at a particular point,
[00:38:10.205 --> 00:38:11.429]  Then what's the discussion about?
[00:38:11.931 --> 00:38:13.075]  You have no right.
[00:38:14.118 --> 00:38:15.603]  So you're talking about disenfranchising.
[00:38:15.643 --> 00:38:16.607]  There's no discussion.
[00:38:18.825 --> 00:38:24.168]  Their tactics in the social justice worry movement are to stifle and shut down free speech.
[00:38:24.768 --> 00:38:32.573]  And I would argue, in the world that I live in, which is the bare-knuckle world, they're leveraging their position because they don't have power.
[00:38:33.253 --> 00:38:38.376]  Now, of course, their argument is they've been systemically disenfranchised by systems.
[00:38:39.477 --> 00:38:40.538]  Pick your poison on that.
[00:38:41.018 --> 00:38:42.279]  They might even have an argument.
[00:38:43.404 --> 00:38:53.190]  Okay, but at the end of the day, if you don't recognize the leverage that they're using, you ultimately come back to the same conclusion, which is they don't have power because they are not on the moral high ground.
[00:38:53.730 --> 00:39:06.438]  The moral high ground would be, I want to engage you because ultimately I believe that my argument will win over your argument, or I will place something in your heart, like the mustard seed like Jesus talked about, that will grow and make you realize the error of your ways.
[00:39:06.718 --> 00:39:07.859]  That is not what this is about.
[00:39:08.621 --> 00:39:08.761]  Yes.
[00:39:27.338 --> 00:39:35.943]  Kind of an evolutionary step that we as humans need to take versus, okay, now I'm being told that this is what I'm being conditioned to accept socialism.
[00:39:36.063 --> 00:39:39.584]  I think if you're curious, you have to start by separating the truth.
[00:39:40.245 --> 00:39:43.947]  I think admitting to yourself your own truth is always a good place to start.
[00:39:44.987 --> 00:39:50.730]  Like when I watch some of the clips that you guys have been putting up at some of these protests, I have no respect for what these people are doing.
[00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:51.331]  I don't.
[00:39:51.691 --> 00:39:55.073]  They're shutting down free speech, they're shutting down processes that
[00:39:56.794 --> 00:39:57.535]  I just don't get it.
[00:39:58.635 --> 00:40:02.178]  To me it's antithetical to the society that I believe in.
[00:40:03.078 --> 00:40:06.581]  And as I said on Alex's show, they're eventually going to come after me.
[00:40:07.361 --> 00:40:08.802]  It's just the way history works.
[00:40:09.403 --> 00:40:09.663]  Okay?
[00:40:10.723 --> 00:40:10.964]  But...
[00:40:12.957 --> 00:40:22.024]  I try to listen to their argument and where I do recognize the argument is having merit, I try to consider it and then I try to think in terms of practical application.
[00:40:22.545 --> 00:40:24.266]  In essence, don't become them.
[00:40:25.227 --> 00:40:27.629]  Don't shut your ears.
[00:40:28.469 --> 00:40:30.751]  Try to understand the forces at play.
[00:40:31.512 --> 00:40:38.918]  It's hard to tell someone who feels disenfranchised by the system or the government or whatever world they live in.
[00:40:41.287 --> 00:40:53.196]  You try to tell someone here who you might argue is taking advantage of our social welfare system or gaming the system somehow, and say, look, you're telling me America sucks and you're spitting on the flag.
[00:40:54.356 --> 00:40:57.519]  Try go living in one of these third world countries and see how far that gets you.
[00:40:59.263 --> 00:41:13.415]  You know, it's always very interesting to me, and this is a very prickly point to make, it's very interesting to me when you see the way gays and lesbians are treated in some other countries in the world.
[00:41:13.435 --> 00:41:27.506]  If they have that level of vitriol for, let's say, Donald Trump as a candidate, because they feel it's antithetical to what they believe in, where's the five times greater condemnation for those societies that are treating their people?
[00:41:28.382 --> 00:41:31.104]  Far worse than just words and ideas.
[00:41:31.705 --> 00:41:35.348]  I mean, it's always interesting to me how people kind of pick their spots.
[00:41:36.088 --> 00:41:39.091]  That always rings a... it's like a red flag for me.
[00:41:39.651 --> 00:41:42.714]  That means they're really not in it at the real level.
[00:41:43.294 --> 00:41:43.815]  Right.
[00:41:43.935 --> 00:41:46.477]  And then you start realizing, look, most people are trendy.
[00:41:47.738 --> 00:41:47.898]  Right?
[00:41:47.958 --> 00:41:48.678]  Most people are trendy.
[00:41:49.119 --> 00:41:52.081]  For every five hardcore people that are there, they're spitting in your face.
[00:41:52.241 --> 00:41:56.365]  There's 50 people there just doing the... They just want to be a part of the scene.
[00:41:56.465 --> 00:41:56.685]  Yeah.
[00:41:57.265 --> 00:41:57.446]  Yeah.
[00:41:59.131 --> 00:42:01.295]  What do you think about that, that we have people
[00:42:07.116 --> 00:42:20.219]  Wanting to take away what makes this country so great and gives them the right and the freedom to go out there and say whatever they want and they want to now chip away at free speech trying to say, well, it's offensive.
[00:42:20.339 --> 00:42:24.700]  And so should offensive speech, should you be allowed to do it?
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.441]  You know, not everyone's offended by speech.
[00:42:27.521 --> 00:42:28.401]  So how do you?
[00:42:28.481 --> 00:42:29.622]  That's a fantastic question.
[00:42:29.642 --> 00:42:34.063]  I'm going to say something that I think is probably the most important thing to me in everything that we're talking about.
[00:42:36.496 --> 00:42:42.138]  We all remember the cartoon, you know, Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam or whatever, and draws a line.
[00:42:42.858 --> 00:42:46.099]  You don't step over that line, he steps over the line, and he draws another line, right?
[00:42:47.899 --> 00:42:49.720]  For me, personally, we're at the last line.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:53.261]  Free speech is the last line.
[00:42:54.281 --> 00:42:56.982]  So, if you're saying to me, look,
[00:42:58.618 --> 00:42:59.639]  What's more important?
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:09.772]  Identifying with social movements that do have valid and real concerns as they see it from their own perspective and community.
[00:43:09.832 --> 00:43:14.979]  In essence, their voice does need to be heard and respected, even if at the end of the day you don't agree.
[00:43:17.952 --> 00:43:28.019]  Okay, if that can be done while maintaining free speech, in essence, we're kind of a rolling Linus ball of dust and we're just moving forward as civilizations do, great.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.181]  I'm more than happy to have that discussion.
[00:43:30.902 --> 00:43:36.446]  I'm more than happy to have that discussion with politicos, people in the entertainment business, social justice warriors.
[00:43:36.746 --> 00:43:43.551]  And I've had these discussions through the years with, I mean, when I talked about God in the 90s in my songs, you know, the right-wing preachers came to me.
[00:43:43.991 --> 00:43:49.732]  I was, one of my proudest moments was I was picketed in the last year by the... Westboro?
[00:43:49.752 --> 00:43:49.932]  Yeah.
[00:43:50.272 --> 00:43:51.512]  I was like, wow, badge of honor.
[00:43:51.592 --> 00:43:52.173]  This is awesome.
[00:43:52.653 --> 00:43:53.113]  You know what I mean?
[00:43:53.133 --> 00:43:54.433]  I'm actually still dangerous, right?
[00:43:54.453 --> 00:43:54.593]  Yeah.
[00:43:55.033 --> 00:43:56.313]  Okay.
[00:43:56.813 --> 00:44:06.155]  To me, and I hope this makes sense because I'm rambling a bit, but the free speech line, without free speech, none of those arguments matter.
[00:44:06.515 --> 00:44:06.655]  Right.
[00:44:07.615 --> 00:44:07.976]  Not a one.
[00:44:08.936 --> 00:44:10.016]  Because once we lose that,
[00:44:11.732 --> 00:44:12.192]  There's no end.
[00:44:12.872 --> 00:44:15.533]  And I'm sorry if you're a student of history and I've read plenty of books.
[00:44:17.233 --> 00:44:17.654]  You name it.
[00:44:18.494 --> 00:44:32.818]  If you've ever seen The Killing Fields about Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, what Stalin did, obviously what Hitler did, any socialist system, which tend to be left by the way, just a little point in there, once you cross that line,
[00:44:34.599 --> 00:44:39.641]  You look at every totalitarian regime in the last hundred and something years, who did they kill first?
[00:44:39.841 --> 00:44:40.721]  They killed the disabled.
[00:44:41.061 --> 00:44:41.801]  And who did they kill next?
[00:44:41.861 --> 00:44:42.581]  They killed the artists.
[00:44:43.702 --> 00:44:43.962]  Okay?
[00:44:44.362 --> 00:44:49.584]  Why are ideas, as John Lennon once sang, imagine, da da da, why are ideas so powerful?
[00:44:49.824 --> 00:44:50.584]  Because they are.
[00:44:51.664 --> 00:44:53.665]  They are the thing that cannot be defended against.
[00:44:54.165 --> 00:44:59.727]  An idea, a whisper, a rumor cannot, no wall can stop the truth, right?
[00:45:02.028 --> 00:45:08.117]  No matter what side you're on, left, right, libertarian, you lose the free speech lane, it's over.
[00:45:09.039 --> 00:45:10.821]  Because we all lose.
[00:45:11.703 --> 00:45:12.324]  Every one of us.
[00:45:12.624 --> 00:45:16.149]  And I don't care who you are, where you come from, where you're at on the wheel.
[00:45:18.593 --> 00:45:30.397]  Which does explain, sort of in the greater zeitgeist of the idea, why the mega-wealthy and the elites are preparing to go off-grid, off-planet, buying lots of land in Costa Rica or B.C.
[00:45:30.457 --> 00:45:36.580]  and all that stuff, because they got the quarterback read, and they see when that fur goes, it's gonna fly.
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:39.201]  We don't want to get there, that's my point.
[00:45:39.441 --> 00:45:42.322]  Once we lose that lane of free speech in this country, it's over.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.723]  It might still be called America, but it is over.
[00:45:47.624 --> 00:45:51.469]  So, I don't care what your trendy argument, I don't care what your hashtag argument is.
[00:45:51.569 --> 00:45:54.752]  If you do not stand for free speech, you do not stand for America.
[00:45:54.892 --> 00:45:56.374]  That means you want something else.
[00:45:57.095 --> 00:46:00.879]  And if you think your something else is going to be better than America, I'm here to tell you, you're wrong.
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:03.642]  And I will fight that fight to my dying breath.
[00:46:04.448 --> 00:46:08.269]  Because look, I was propagandized as a kid to believe that everything America did was great.
[00:46:08.869 --> 00:46:14.431]  And like a lot of people, as I got into the world in the 70s and 80s, I realized that wasn't true.
[00:46:14.971 --> 00:46:17.292]  America has done plenty of horrible things.
[00:46:17.552 --> 00:46:19.713]  Start with the Native Americans and work your way backwards.
[00:46:21.213 --> 00:46:24.755]  So I'm no, you know, America's perfect, you know?
[00:46:25.336 --> 00:46:27.097]  I've never believed that, nor did my father.
[00:46:27.537 --> 00:46:32.700]  But I do believe America's better than any other political and social system that's ever been created in the world.
[00:46:33.281 --> 00:46:35.002]  Prove me wrong, I'm willing to listen.
[00:46:35.522 --> 00:46:36.403]  But we're Americans.
[00:46:36.883 --> 00:46:37.803]  We love our country.
[00:46:38.404 --> 00:46:41.005]  And if you're a true American, you even love the enemy.
[00:46:41.846 --> 00:46:42.046]  Right.
[00:46:42.066 --> 00:46:46.129]  So we can cry and laugh and shake our heads at the social justice warriors.
[00:46:46.429 --> 00:46:49.511]  True Americans and libertarians want them in that system.
[00:47:03.123 --> 00:47:07.444]  Get BrainForce at 25% off for a limited time at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:47:07.584 --> 00:47:09.785]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.905 --> 00:47:16.707]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:47:16.927 --> 00:47:20.208]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.228 --> 00:47:21.408]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.688 --> 00:47:23.529]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:52.195]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:47:52.396 --> 00:47:53.016]  Or call 888-253-3139.

[00:47:55.759 --> 00:47:56.920]  And we thank you for your support.
[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.376]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.776 --> 00:48:34.997]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.298 --> 00:48:37.598]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:48:38.258 --> 00:48:40.699]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:48:41.079 --> 00:48:46.580]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:53.686]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
[00:48:54.046 --> 00:48:58.890]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:49:04.346 --> 00:49:11.307]  The social media is kind of the engine where a lot of these social justice movements is kind of gaining momentum.
[00:49:11.767 --> 00:49:16.828]  But it's also where they're being sort of corralled and controlled as well.
[00:49:17.248 --> 00:49:28.230]  So they can take your free speech and hide that line of code so it never trends or the algorithms will just shut down and you won't be able to reach your audience.
[00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:32.551]  And so talk to people a little bit about how to use these
[00:49:33.511 --> 00:49:38.452]  A lot of my friends are what I would quantify as average American citizen in my family.
[00:49:38.472 --> 00:49:45.093]  What do they do at a participatory level to either encourage or discourage things that they don't agree with?
[00:49:58.667 --> 00:50:10.935]  And I think it takes a little bit more savvy, if we're in the info war, it takes a little bit more savvy to know how to get into those systems in a way that we can leverage our own position, just like the social justice warriors do.
[00:50:12.336 --> 00:50:17.779]  But at the same time, not resort to the kind of the scummy part of it all, which is sort of leading people astray.
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:23.423]  Look, when you use the word liberty, most people don't find that word sexy.
[00:50:24.301 --> 00:50:28.784]  You know, racist has a lot more ooh-ahh to it than libertarian.
[00:50:29.104 --> 00:50:36.348]  Libertarian sounds like you're stuck in the back of a truck with Ron Paul and he's talking to you about, like, you know, policy papers and freedom.
[00:50:36.388 --> 00:50:38.169]  It doesn't sound very exciting to me, okay?
[00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:40.751]  You know, I tend to like the social argument.
[00:50:42.878 --> 00:50:56.935]  You have to start, this would be my argument, you have to start by identifying that the most powerful thing in the world right now are these technocratic systems that are in place, search engines, the way we connect on these social platforms.
[00:50:58.214 --> 00:51:04.916]  Governments have either encouraged these things to come along or quickly realized that they were the new arms of control.
[00:51:05.897 --> 00:51:10.658]  And so you have to ask yourself whether your participation in these systems is actually enslaving you.
[00:51:11.238 --> 00:51:22.422]  Then you have to drill down a little further and you have to want to ask questions about if what you're doing and participating in is truly as open as it seems.
[00:51:23.689 --> 00:51:29.873]  So if Twitter, for example, is full of people of a diversity of opinions, and you feel like, hey, it's capitalist.
[00:51:30.294 --> 00:51:31.595]  It's my idea versus yours.
[00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:32.335]  Who tweets more?
[00:51:32.395 --> 00:51:33.396]  Who gets more retweets?
[00:51:33.436 --> 00:51:35.417]  Who says the right incendiary thing?
[00:51:35.477 --> 00:51:36.458]  Who does the right mean?
[00:51:36.618 --> 00:51:36.878]  Great.
[00:51:37.659 --> 00:51:38.619]  That's America.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:38.940]  Great.
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:42.521]  And I would only argue, you know, where do you cross the line?
[00:51:43.061 --> 00:51:43.961]  And you see it all the time.
[00:51:44.081 --> 00:51:46.021]  I mean, InfoWars puts up articles.
[00:51:46.922 --> 00:51:58.464]  As somebody who's in the world, and I have to watch what I say, when you see a page that's literally, and the page is, the Facebook page is, assassinate Donald Trump, and I believe Facebook comes out and says, that doesn't violate our standards and practices.
[00:51:58.484 --> 00:51:58.604]  Yeah.
[00:51:58.964 --> 00:52:06.686]  Okay, that's where somebody like myself has to ask, is my participation in the Facebook system, and I would call it a system,
[00:52:07.486 --> 00:52:10.887]  Am I actually encouraging something which, as an American, I find offensive.
[00:52:11.607 --> 00:52:19.269]  And I also find it offensive that a business would support... You can call... I would have no problem with a page that said, Donald Trump's a racist.
[00:52:19.509 --> 00:52:22.430]  Donald Trump's a homophobe.
[00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:23.730]  Because that's just opinion.
[00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:27.671]  The minute you talk about killing someone... Sorry.
[00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:30.712]  That's where you need to step in as a business and say, I will not support that.
[00:52:32.202 --> 00:52:34.184]  So why is that okay?
[00:52:34.665 --> 00:52:39.991]  But you can imagine what page you could create on Facebook today, and there would be calls for you to never work here at InfoWars ever again.
[00:52:40.391 --> 00:52:40.952]  Right.
[00:52:41.292 --> 00:52:42.453]  That's where it gets funky.
[00:52:42.994 --> 00:52:53.645]  So you have to be sophisticated enough to look at those systems and say, is my participation encouraging something that I know deep down is intrinsically not only flawed, but counterintuitive to what I want to be part of?
[00:52:54.906 --> 00:52:57.228]  And in essence, your participation is condonement.
[00:52:57.668 --> 00:52:58.849]  Now, I run a business.
[00:52:58.949 --> 00:53:00.030]  I have a Facebook page.
[00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:03.412]  I need the Facebook page at this day to run my business.
[00:53:03.712 --> 00:53:04.792]  It's an effective system.
[00:53:05.073 --> 00:53:06.033]  I don't like everything.
[00:53:06.373 --> 00:53:21.943]  So that's just another piece of information that may ultimately push me off Facebook, and I'm willing to take the commercial and public hit of not having that reach that I have to the four million plus people that follow us on Facebook, because at the end of the day, I as an American can't support that.
[00:53:22.665 --> 00:53:23.746]  So, does it bother me?
[00:53:23.806 --> 00:53:24.066]  Yes.
[00:53:24.747 --> 00:53:26.208]  Do I have to have the argument in my head?
[00:53:26.288 --> 00:53:26.548]  Yes.
[00:53:27.148 --> 00:53:28.650]  To this point, I haven't made that decision.
[00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:31.832]  If you're not having that argument in your own head, then you're not participating.
[00:53:32.132 --> 00:53:36.015]  And then, to use Alex's term, you're just a drone who's just falling around.
[00:53:36.075 --> 00:53:37.876]  You're pretending you have no influence, and you do.
[00:53:38.908 --> 00:53:56.193]  And I think too it's really time for a lot of us who are libertarians and who are for freedom and who are concerned and who do, we're not kind of in the trance, we do see, we do need to start coming together and working and setting up our own systems to counteract
[00:53:56.713 --> 00:53:59.454]  That's why I would use the word empowerment.
[00:53:59.854 --> 00:54:03.535]  Empowering people with, let's not call it the facts and the truth.
[00:54:03.555 --> 00:54:05.536]  The facts and truth are always kind of ephemeral.
[00:54:05.676 --> 00:54:07.237]  It's eye of the beholder stuff.
[00:54:07.577 --> 00:54:13.339]  Empowering people to have a better range of decision making as far as how they approach their social systems, I think that's powerful.
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:27.226]  Then if you take the extra step and you say, like, maybe InfoWars sets up its own version of social media so that like-minded businesses are able to participate in a system that is ultimately holistic to the ideas that you would believe in.
[00:54:27.266 --> 00:54:27.466]  Yeah.
[00:54:27.666 --> 00:54:31.127]  Some open source social media networks as well.
[00:54:31.328 --> 00:54:32.628]  I think those days are coming soon.
[00:54:32.768 --> 00:54:32.968]  Yeah.
[00:54:33.248 --> 00:54:38.491]  And trust me, if 20% of people suddenly jumped off Facebook, they would notice.
[00:54:38.831 --> 00:54:39.011]  Yeah.
[00:54:39.051 --> 00:54:40.452]  They look at those numbers every day.
[00:54:40.632 --> 00:54:42.453]  Just like I would notice if suddenly there were 20% empty seats.
[00:54:43.835 --> 00:54:58.372]  Well, it's like you have these huge groups, like the Soros-backed groups there, that they've all joined together now, all these little minority movements, they've all decided to come together and now they are a smaller majority movement.
[00:54:58.412 --> 00:55:01.735]  But the beauty of... And so people are, you know, you've got to understand what you're up against.
[00:55:02.316 --> 00:55:06.599]  You know, again, from a capitalist free market position, I don't have any problem with that.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:14.024]  If seven independent hot dog stands band together to form a hot dog association because they need to leverage their position in the market, great.
[00:55:14.465 --> 00:55:15.666]  They should have the right to do that.
[00:55:16.546 --> 00:55:23.711]  The thing you know, though, and you know it and you can know it in your heart, and I'm going to say it right to the camera, they will all turn on each other.
[00:55:24.932 --> 00:55:26.113]  The left always eats its own.
[00:55:27.134 --> 00:55:28.675]  And the minute they gain what they want,
[00:55:29.718 --> 00:55:33.039]  They'll turn on each other because they're rapacious and they can't help themselves.
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:34.840]  They have to have a cause.
[00:55:35.541 --> 00:55:37.361]  Their identity is born of the cause.
[00:55:37.641 --> 00:55:42.344]  There was a great article that came out when the gay marriage, the Supreme Court, all that stuff.
[00:55:42.604 --> 00:55:44.244]  Okay, gay marriage is now part of the law of the land.
[00:55:45.545 --> 00:55:49.947]  Okay, there were articles about people being depressed because the movement was over.
[00:55:51.323 --> 00:55:51.703]  They'd won.
[00:55:51.723 --> 00:55:52.584]  Yeah.
[00:55:52.764 --> 00:55:58.150]  You know, if that was your argument and you wanted it and you got it, great, that's an incredible victory if that's the side you're on.
[00:55:58.871 --> 00:56:05.698]  And having grown up and watched people die of AIDS and being part of that in my own particular way, I thought, good, great, you got what you wanted.
[00:56:07.418 --> 00:56:11.843]  Gotta go on to the next thing, because it was about the identity of waving that particular flag.
[00:56:11.883 --> 00:56:13.846]  The victory was not in the thing.
[00:56:13.886 --> 00:56:15.367]  The victory was in the march.
[00:56:15.427 --> 00:56:17.310]  Yeah, being a part of that big movement.
[00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:22.996]  So understand, a lot of these trendies, the minute the thing gets boring, or it gets too hard, or it breaks down into policy...
[00:56:24.173 --> 00:56:26.574]  Social movements are easy to begin, you know?
[00:56:26.954 --> 00:56:28.895]  You're being disenfranchised, yeah!
[00:56:29.115 --> 00:56:30.235]  Your vote counts, yeah.
[00:56:30.515 --> 00:56:41.660]  When you get into the level of policy and regulation and sitting, like I have, at the local civic board meeting for four hours and they're talking about water mains, that's where most people, that's where the trendy stuff stops.
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:42.680]  They'll tap out.
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.081]  And or they'll turn on each other.
[00:56:44.361 --> 00:56:52.644]  So at least in your own heart, when you watch them abusing InfoWars reporters, no, they can't, they're not, look in 20 years and see where they're at.
[00:56:53.624 --> 00:56:56.005]  They won't be still twizzling the New Year's toy.
[00:56:56.125 --> 00:56:56.665]  Guaranteed.
[00:56:56.685 --> 00:56:57.025]  Right.
[00:56:57.185 --> 00:57:03.667]  Yeah, well that's why a lot of people point out how, for instance, Bernie Sanders isn't really reaching a lot of people that are 30 and up.
[00:57:04.007 --> 00:57:05.087]  Or even 40 and up.
[00:57:05.147 --> 00:57:10.149]  Because it's a lot of just young people that don't necessarily have the experience.
[00:57:10.169 --> 00:57:11.989]  46% of Americans don't pay any form of tax.
[00:57:12.649 --> 00:57:15.130]  At least in terms of federal or state.
[00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:16.270]  Of course.
[00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:17.450]  Free stuff?
[00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:17.771]  Great.
[00:57:17.831 --> 00:57:18.691]  Give me more free stuff.
[00:57:19.011 --> 00:57:19.171]  Yeah.
[00:57:19.795 --> 00:57:20.896]  Sounds good to me.
[00:57:20.916 --> 00:57:21.536]  No freedom.
[00:57:21.596 --> 00:57:22.257]  That's why I'm for Bernie.
[00:57:22.337 --> 00:57:23.058]  I want more free stuff.
[00:57:23.238 --> 00:57:24.138]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:24.559 --> 00:57:27.281]  Well, Billy, thank you so much for joining us in studio.
[00:57:27.301 --> 00:57:33.566]  This is kind of the first of a series of social, cultural breakdowns we're going to be doing.
[00:57:33.586 --> 00:57:35.467]  It's the beginning of your own personal revolution.
[00:57:36.128 --> 00:57:36.908]  Yes, indeed.
[00:57:37.248 --> 00:57:39.090]  Our individual, true individual ideas.
[00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:40.191]  Well, thank you so much.
[00:57:57.436 --> 00:58:05.843]  There's a lot of young people here tonight.
[00:58:05.923 --> 00:58:06.823]  Does this mean something?
[00:58:06.843 --> 00:58:14.930]  Does this mean we've got a bunch of old people?
[00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:17.131]  That talk, and love, and this, and over and over again.
[00:58:37.452 --> 00:58:41.273]  That was a great interview between Billy and Leanne that happened right here in the studio.
[00:58:41.674 --> 00:58:50.957]  Now, I knew of the Smashing Pumpkins for many years, but I didn't know how political Billy was until I started watching this show and then I went back and saw some of the previous interviews he had done with Alex Jones.
[00:58:51.237 --> 00:58:53.278]  Well, thank you so much, Billy, for stopping in studio.
[00:58:53.698 --> 00:58:57.820]  I'm Jakari Jackson from the InfoWars Command Center, and we'll see you again tomorrow night.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.001]  Knockout is back.
