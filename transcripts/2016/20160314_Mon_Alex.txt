[00:00:04.864 --> 00:00:09.707]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.707 --> 00:00:11.268]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.268 --> 00:00:12.828]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.828 --> 00:00:17.031]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:22.854]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.854 --> 00:00:28.477]  Well, as usual, we have an ultra-massive overflow of over-the-top news and a bunch of guests joining us today.
[00:00:32.294 --> 00:00:34.196]  I always follow my gut.
[00:00:34.196 --> 00:00:39.980]  Especially as I live longer, I learn that it's never wrong.
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.245]  And the day before they did the fake Bin Laden raid, I was really upset and called the crew together on that Saturday.
[00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.386]  And the next day they staged the raid.
[00:00:47.386 --> 00:00:54.732]  And it's not that killing one person or killing some body double was what got me in my gut so upset.
[00:00:54.732 --> 00:00:59.036]  It signaled the launch and the rollout of a larger chain reaction.
[00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:08.576]  And then on the morning of Scalia's death, approximately eight hours before it was announced, I got really freaked out.
[00:01:08.576 --> 00:01:09.957]  Every culture knows about this.
[00:01:09.957 --> 00:01:22.067]  Everybody's got a grandma or a cousin or a brother or they themselves have learned that their gut is particularly sensitive and accurate.
[00:01:22.067 --> 00:01:26.671]  Call it the sixth sense, whatever you want to label it as, it's real.
[00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:34.059]  And I actually called Rob Dube, Buckley, and Anthony Gucciardi down here on that Saturday.
[00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:40.464]  We were here from noon until eight at night, even an hour after Khalia's death was announced.
[00:01:40.464 --> 00:01:51.594]  I didn't even know because I was busy planning things and talking about how they're getting ready to start a race war and how they're getting ready to try to start a war with North Korea and Russia.
[00:01:51.594 --> 00:01:57.559]  And I was running around like a Jack Russell terrier
[00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:09.330]  Just trying to desperately figure out why I was so upset that morning.
[00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:24.393]  And it isn't just that they killed Scalia, it's that they would do it in part of a secret society, the evidence at all points said it, throw it in our face that there was no autopsy, and it signifies where they're going with the entire intimidation of this government and other major governments.
[00:02:28.396 --> 00:02:30.378]  It isn't just his death.
[00:02:30.378 --> 00:02:34.583]  It's that it signified a new phase.
[00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:38.848]  Now, I don't know what's going on right now.
[00:02:38.848 --> 00:02:43.995]  And I have a million thoughts going through my mind a minute.
[00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:44.856]  But let's say...
[00:02:47.182 --> 00:02:51.924]  The most upset I ever got was in the three weeks before 9-11.
[00:02:51.924 --> 00:03:06.251]  Really, it started two months before, but in the weeks before, you can go back to my radio show, they're getting ready to stage giant terror attacks, they're getting ready to take our liberties, they're getting ready to launch what will turn into world government, they'll probably blame their CIA asset Osama Bin Laden.
[00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:09.592]  You can just type into Google, Alex Jones predicted 9-11.
[00:03:09.592 --> 00:03:13.894]  And you can see the TV show, hear the radio show, you name it.
[00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:15.775]  That was the strongest I ever felt.
[00:03:17.076 --> 00:03:18.597]  The Bin Laden thing was big.
[00:03:18.597 --> 00:03:20.759]  Scalia was huge.
[00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:27.425]  What I'm feeling now... Let me not exaggerate.
[00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:31.388]  It's about 20 times what I felt before 9-11.
[00:03:31.388 --> 00:03:35.432]  I can barely be on air right now, okay?
[00:03:35.432 --> 00:03:36.993]  I don't know if it's nuclear war.
[00:03:36.993 --> 00:03:38.354]  I don't know if it's a stock market crash.
[00:03:38.354 --> 00:03:39.916]  I don't know if they're gonna assassinate Donald Trump.
[00:03:41.331 --> 00:03:56.267]  I don't know if it's somebody coming after me personally, but I use the allegory or the analogy of in the Lord of the Rings, they've got the sword stinging that when the goblins or the orcs are near, it glows blue.
[00:03:56.267 --> 00:04:02.514]  Well, the sword's glowing as blue as that background you see right there if you're watching this on television.
[00:04:02.514 --> 00:04:03.435]  Bright white blue.
[00:04:10.922 --> 00:04:15.906]  And I think about the things we've already caught these sinister forces doing.
[00:04:15.906 --> 00:04:23.151]  What we know is show over the top.
[00:04:23.151 --> 00:04:24.332]  That I have no idea.
[00:04:24.332 --> 00:04:27.815]  I have no idea what else they're up to that we don't know about.
[00:04:27.815 --> 00:04:33.539]  I mean, they've been acting in total secrecy with all of our money and all of our science since 1947.
[00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:34.220]  God knows what they built.
[00:04:38.086 --> 00:04:40.447]  They have the equations for atomic weapons in 1900.
[00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:43.187]  It's 2016.
[00:04:43.187 --> 00:04:55.251]  The reality we're living in, undoubtedly, is a sub-basement of the real technocracy built all around us.
[00:04:55.251 --> 00:04:56.091]  We're already in the Matrix.
[00:04:58.462 --> 00:05:02.327]  Thanks to the Federal Reserve System, America's economy is in a terminal decline.
[00:05:02.327 --> 00:05:07.654]  And according to economic expert Michael Snyder, here's 8 facts that reveal just how bad the economy really is.
[00:05:07.654 --> 00:05:08.055]  Number 1.
[00:05:08.055 --> 00:05:11.339]  The majority of all American workers bring home less than $30,000 a year in wages.
[00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.640]  Number 2.
[00:05:13.442 --> 00:05:18.725]  The poorest 40% of all Americans now spend most of their incomes just on food and housing.
[00:05:18.725 --> 00:05:24.189]  At least 50% of Americans who rent their homes spend more than a third of their incomes on the rent.
[00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:26.810]  Incomes keep declining for a large majority of the U.S.
[00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.531]  population.
[00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:32.774]  The price of ground beef has more than doubled since 2009.
[00:05:32.774 --> 00:05:34.395]  The rate of homeownership in the U.S.
[00:05:34.395 --> 00:05:36.756]  has been declining for at least 7 years in a row.
[00:05:36.756 --> 00:05:40.139]  It's now the lowest that it's been in 20 years.
[00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.400]  Almost half of all Americans are not saving their money.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.725]  And it's been estimated that 62% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
[00:05:46.725 --> 00:05:47.546]  Number 8.
[00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:51.291]  One third of all Americans with student loans are currently behind on their student loan debt.

[00:08:15.999 --> 00:08:22.484]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:22.484 --> 00:08:27.587]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.587 --> 00:08:35.252]  We have several affiliates in Chicago and one of the affiliates carries our show six days a week.
[00:08:35.252 --> 00:08:39.295]  The owner of the station, manager of the station, is going to be popping in at the start of the next hour.
[00:08:39.295 --> 00:08:43.138]  He was in the Black Lives Matter
[00:08:45.543 --> 00:08:54.145]  MoveOn.org, Hillary Clinton sponsored Operation last Friday, and even shot some video of it.
[00:08:54.145 --> 00:09:00.266]  He's going to be popping in to give his particular view and perspective on it.
[00:09:00.266 --> 00:09:05.787]  And then we're also going to have the consummate Trump insider, Roger Stone, joining us.
[00:09:05.787 --> 00:09:11.928]  He's got a Daily Caller article dealing with the fact of who Ted Cruz really works for.
[00:09:13.137 --> 00:09:19.002]  And there's also another article out dealing with the sex scandal that's about to break, dealing with Ted Cruz as well.
[00:09:19.002 --> 00:09:24.748]  We're going to be looking at that with Mr. Stone coming up.
[00:09:24.748 --> 00:09:36.078]  Also, Stone had people inside the Hillary slash David Brock Media Matters meetings in D.C.
[00:09:37.492 --> 00:09:41.775]  Days before when they were planning what they did last week in Chicago, that's now spreading to other cities.
[00:09:41.775 --> 00:09:45.697]  But that was the beta test detonator.
[00:09:45.697 --> 00:09:50.981]  Thousands of protesters coming in and attacking Trump supporters and vice versa.
[00:09:50.981 --> 00:09:56.525]  Police being attacked, you name it.
[00:09:56.525 --> 00:10:02.468]  And people waving Bernie Sanders signs and chanting Bernie.
[00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:04.390]  Well, MoveOn.org is supporting Hillary.
[00:10:05.776 --> 00:10:15.612]  George Soros funds moveon.org and Bernie having his people do this in reality gives him a black eye.
[00:10:15.612 --> 00:10:19.598]  And then Hillary stays out of the fight while Trump and the Sanders people go after each other.
[00:10:20.407 --> 00:10:26.453]  Hillary also knows that the Sanders people, a large portion of them in polls, will not go for Hillary.
[00:10:26.453 --> 00:10:41.288]  So they need to condition the Bernie supporters psychologically to hate Trump and actually hear that Bernie supporters are going after Trump to create a domino effect, a snowball effect, a copycat effect, and to have them actually go after Trump.
[00:10:41.288 --> 00:10:43.310]  So it's a very sophisticated PSYOP.
[00:10:45.507 --> 00:10:52.352]  And Trump knows that the public is somewhat simple and dumbed down, so he just keeps going with, Bernie, you're communist, you better watch it.
[00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:56.695]  Because they got Bernie signs, they're professionally printed, they're saying they're for Sanders.
[00:10:56.695 --> 00:11:02.820]  The only problem is Sanders doesn't have a history of calling for violence and for taking over demonstrations.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.103]  And it's not really his style, and we've not seen him deploying these type of dirty tricks.
[00:11:07.103 --> 00:11:11.706]  We have seen George Soros and Hillary do this all over the world, not just here.
[00:11:11.706 --> 00:11:14.248]  So this is their MO, and they took credit.
[00:11:15.868 --> 00:11:24.574]  So I gotta say, Donald Trump is wrong, and his advisor is right, and I don't like to set the two against each other, but Trump is his own man.
[00:11:24.574 --> 00:11:25.995]  This has been known since Saturday.
[00:11:25.995 --> 00:11:27.416]  I interviewed Stone Saturday.
[00:11:27.416 --> 00:11:29.938]  We aired it yesterday on the Sunday Show.
[00:11:29.938 --> 00:11:34.000]  The interview is up on InfoWars.com and on PrisonPlanet.com as well.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.962]  We're gonna be talking about that.
[00:11:35.962 --> 00:11:38.904]  Now that said, here's just a smattering of the news.
[00:11:38.904 --> 00:11:40.425]  I tend to not get to the tech news.
[00:11:42.219 --> 00:11:43.460]  Though it's some of the most important.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.703]  Let me just mention what's coming up in that little stack.
[00:11:47.703 --> 00:11:52.026]  Media mogul plans to live forever by uploading his personality into a robot.
[00:11:52.026 --> 00:11:53.407]  London Telegraph.
[00:11:53.407 --> 00:11:56.430]  Now the only reason I read that is you've heard that here thousands of times.
[00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.672]  This is what MIT was saying 30 years ago was the plan.
[00:11:59.672 --> 00:12:03.275]  Now they're just pushing it openly.
[00:12:03.275 --> 00:12:04.456]  Here's another one.
[00:12:04.456 --> 00:12:07.298]  How gut bacteria are shaking up cancer research.
[00:12:07.298 --> 00:12:08.739]  Bloomberg Business.
[00:12:08.739 --> 00:12:09.339]  We have had
[00:12:10.518 --> 00:12:24.621]  Medical doctors on, we have had top vaccine experts on, endocrinologist on, experts on the gut.
[00:12:24.621 --> 00:12:36.343]  We've had all these different types of medical doctors on, and we've had Dr. Group on, breaking down the fact that pesticides, especially Roundup, in the stomach,
[00:12:37.441 --> 00:12:45.604]  And in the intestines, upper and lower, large and small intestine, is killing the buffers in your body.
[00:12:45.604 --> 00:12:58.389]  And then you're getting bad bacteria, you're getting toxic yeast, you're getting other toxic fungi, and that your autoimmune system shuts down.
[00:12:58.389 --> 00:13:01.890]  And then the T lymphocytes have to actually battle
[00:13:03.903 --> 00:13:10.684]  Inside the bloodstream and inside the tissues, things they never have to fight because the walls are down.
[00:13:10.684 --> 00:13:14.565]  The gates are down.
[00:13:14.565 --> 00:13:24.467]  And that the genetically engineered crops as well have been shown in major studies to leak into the actual DNA of the cells and cause mutation.
[00:13:24.467 --> 00:13:30.429]  So, Roundup grows many cancers, that's admitted.
[00:13:30.429 --> 00:13:30.989]  Glyphosate.
[00:13:31.929 --> 00:13:33.630]  Brand name Roundup.
[00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.030]  Billions of tons a year.
[00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.051]  Billions dumped.
[00:13:36.051 --> 00:13:38.772]  It's just everywhere.
[00:13:38.772 --> 00:13:40.673]  Weed killer.
[00:13:40.673 --> 00:13:42.694]  It grows tumors.
[00:13:42.694 --> 00:13:47.896]  You're also eating GMO crops that leach into your DNA and cause mutations.
[00:13:47.896 --> 00:13:52.018]  But none of that compares to the shield being down in your gut.
[00:13:54.755 --> 00:14:01.240]  Now we don't sell a probiotic yet because we're trying to have the very best cutting edge system they use in Europe.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.582]  And I just finally said, let's just have the best we have right now.
[00:14:03.582 --> 00:14:10.188]  Instead of three years of not being able to put out, you know, this patented stuff that's the very best.
[00:14:10.188 --> 00:14:11.929]  Let's put out the very best we've got now.
[00:14:11.929 --> 00:14:15.212]  And we're doing that.
[00:14:15.212 --> 00:14:21.157]  But if you're not taking probiotics, different brands, different types constantly, you are insane.
[00:14:21.157 --> 00:14:22.398]  And again, I don't sell them yet.
[00:14:23.294 --> 00:14:38.366]  You are out of your mind, because you've got to keep replacing the bacteria, because the bioaccumulation of fluoride, which is an original pesticide, the oldest pesticide used since modern agriculture, it's over 300 years old.
[00:14:38.366 --> 00:14:52.157]  The fluoride, the hydrofluorosilic acid, that's the souped up acid-based fluoride, the weaponized fluoride, the fluoride squared, basically.
[00:14:53.086 --> 00:15:06.738]  And then you've got the glyphosates and then you've got all these other pesticides that are bioaccumulating and you're eating it and it's killing the bacteria in your stomach.
[00:15:06.738 --> 00:15:13.584]  And then there's no buffer there because normally the bacteria would absorb that and eat that.
[00:15:13.584 --> 00:15:17.448]  And instead it's going right through into your intestinal wall, right into your bloodstream.
[00:15:18.996 --> 00:15:24.101]  And the number one thing you can do, it's not even avoiding toxins, that's important.
[00:15:24.101 --> 00:15:29.345]  The number one thing is drink clean purified water and just pump good bacteria into your guts.
[00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:35.530]  And that means also eating pickled things.
[00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:43.818]  Whether it be sauerkraut or pickles or all the hundreds of other things that are out there, you better be doing it and you better be giving it to your kids.
[00:15:45.686 --> 00:15:51.067]  Because here is Bloomberg business and they just admit, okay, that's why cancer is exploding.
[00:15:51.067 --> 00:15:53.368]  Yes, it's one of the big ones.
[00:15:53.368 --> 00:15:56.369]  Now, a lot of cancer is exploding also because it's viral.
[00:15:56.369 --> 00:15:58.129]  There's a lot of weaponized cancer.
[00:15:58.129 --> 00:16:09.672]  But if your immune system hasn't given up, it will identify it and beat it a couple hundred times to zero.
[00:16:09.672 --> 00:16:11.773]  But that's why everybody's getting allergies.
[00:16:13.433 --> 00:16:23.221]  Is your normal stuff that you would be able to deal with, like hay fever, or mountain juniper, or oak, or mold, your body is just like, man, I give up.
[00:16:23.221 --> 00:16:24.623]  I want to lay down.
[00:16:24.623 --> 00:16:25.804]  I'm sick.
[00:16:25.804 --> 00:16:27.325]  I'm hurt.
[00:16:27.325 --> 00:16:28.706]  My sinuses are swelling up.
[00:16:28.706 --> 00:16:30.207]  My lungs hurt.
[00:16:30.207 --> 00:16:31.288]  I'm hurt.
[00:16:31.288 --> 00:16:34.211]  And your body is babbling like someone in the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.101]  In 55 degree temperature, not to die.
[00:16:38.101 --> 00:16:44.943]  I mean, you're just flailing, trying to keep the immune system on, trying not to freeze up and die.
[00:16:44.943 --> 00:16:48.124]  And believe me, folks, this has all been engineered.
[00:16:48.124 --> 00:16:49.864]  The globalists are on record.
[00:16:49.864 --> 00:16:55.286]  It is going to get to where half of the people have cancer.
[00:16:55.286 --> 00:17:03.568]  When I was in England a few years ago, it was a London Telegraph headline, the physical paper at the hotel, that by 2025, half of Brits would have cancer.
[00:17:05.851 --> 00:17:08.673]  By 2025, one in three in the U.S.
[00:17:08.673 --> 00:17:11.055]  will have autism.
[00:17:11.055 --> 00:17:12.196]  Look it up.
[00:17:12.196 --> 00:17:15.579]  One in three.
[00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:17.901]  And see, I'm gonna hit all this other news.
[00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:26.088]  I have hundreds of articles and I just got into two of them and I stopped, but it's so important because everything else is a sideshow.
[00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:32.714]  It really is.
[00:17:32.714 --> 00:17:34.075]  We are being targeted.
[00:17:36.107 --> 00:17:39.450]  We are being hit.
[00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:55.384]  Bill and Melinda Gates, on record, are spending their money on genetic engineering, forced inoculation through food and mosquitoes, and quote, gut flora crisis.
[00:17:55.384 --> 00:18:00.809]  Because they know in the future, our guts are going to be so screwed up if we don't go and get the patented
[00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:08.655]  systems and superbugs that they've developed to block the other superbugs, we're going to die.
[00:18:08.655 --> 00:18:17.401]  Everything that Monsanto and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation does is about making life on this planet, independent of them, impossible.
[00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:21.004]  It's a monopoly on everything.
[00:18:21.004 --> 00:18:26.668]  And their main mission is to normalize all this horror around us.
[00:18:28.254 --> 00:18:38.842]  So that we just incrementally accept that breast cancer's up multi-thousand percentage points and type 1 and type 2 diabetes and all these other cancers.
[00:18:38.842 --> 00:18:46.207]  And so I could sit here today and get into all this other amazing, entertaining news, and I will.
[00:18:46.207 --> 00:18:47.708]  Edifying, important news.
[00:18:47.708 --> 00:18:55.254]  But compared to what they're doing on that front, all of it pales in significance.
[00:18:55.254 --> 00:18:56.975]  Other than Russia threatening to invade
[00:18:58.544 --> 00:19:10.487]  North Korea last week, or use nuclear weapons on them if they continue to threaten offensive pre-emptive strikes on the South Korean capital, Seoul.
[00:19:10.487 --> 00:19:12.348]  And the crazy headlines just go from there.
[00:19:12.348 --> 00:19:16.469]  But how gut bacteria are shaking up gut research.
[00:19:16.469 --> 00:19:21.511]  FDA will likely release GM mosquitoes north of Key West.
[00:19:21.511 --> 00:19:26.232]  Modeled after ants, teams of tiny robots can move a two-ton car, New York Times.
[00:19:27.865 --> 00:19:33.729]  Siri's inventor looks forward to Viv, a giant brain in the sky.
[00:19:33.729 --> 00:19:36.650]  Yep.
[00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.752]  And then you talk to it through Siri.
[00:19:39.752 --> 00:19:40.653]  That's all coming up.
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.085]  And we've got Loretta Lynch and the government war on free speech.
[00:19:45.085 --> 00:19:47.128]  Ron Paul has a report we're going to play.
[00:19:47.128 --> 00:19:52.295]  Jean-Claude Van Damme says Rockefeller and Rothschild families won't let Trump win.
[00:19:52.295 --> 00:19:54.138]  Guaranteed he's a listener.
[00:19:54.138 --> 00:19:57.743]  We've got the transcript about its globalism, how they play countries off against each other.
[00:19:58.775 --> 00:20:00.196]  Suffering from illness or disease?
[00:20:00.196 --> 00:20:01.117]  Frequently in pain?
[00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:01.857]  Over-stressed?

[00:20:02.497 --> 00:20:08.261]  The solution is to oxygenate your cells because disease cannot survive in an oxygen-rich environment.

[00:20:58.471 --> 00:21:02.454]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:21:02.454 --> 00:21:08.738]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:21:08.738 --> 00:21:16.043]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.

[00:21:36.151 --> 00:21:39.732]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:21:39.732 --> 00:21:41.632]  No needles, no injections.
[00:21:41.632 --> 00:21:43.272]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:21:43.272 --> 00:21:44.473]  Try it for yourself.

[00:21:58.001 --> 00:22:01.444]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.851]  It's true.
[00:22:02.851 --> 00:22:07.013]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:22:07.013 --> 00:22:09.395]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:22:09.395 --> 00:22:14.198]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[00:22:14.198 --> 00:22:22.684]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides,
[00:22:22.884 --> 00:22:27.048]  Bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[00:22:30.852 --> 00:22:33.495]  The gold standard in water purification.

[00:23:27.535 --> 00:23:35.417]  If you want to raise the next generation of patriot leaders, take a look at Freedom Project Academy, a Judeo-Christian online school for kindergarten through high school.
[00:23:35.417 --> 00:23:38.138]  No common core teaching methods or high-stakes testing.

[00:23:54.162 --> 00:23:56.143]  That's FPEUSA.org.
[00:24:03.539 --> 00:24:15.701]  So the number one goal of the social controllers is to basically turn the public against each other, use every possible division between humanity, race, color, creed.
[00:24:17.532 --> 00:24:18.873]  Gender.
[00:24:18.873 --> 00:24:20.054]  Region.
[00:24:20.054 --> 00:24:21.735]  Play us off against each other.
[00:24:21.735 --> 00:24:22.856]  Pose as our saviors.
[00:24:22.856 --> 00:24:31.503]  Bring in a world government that micromanages and taxes every action for social engineering to phase out humanity as we know it.
[00:24:31.503 --> 00:24:32.704]  That's all stated.
[00:24:32.704 --> 00:24:34.185]  It's on record.
[00:24:34.185 --> 00:24:35.386]  I talked about it 20 years ago.
[00:24:35.386 --> 00:24:36.166]  People didn't believe me.
[00:24:36.166 --> 00:24:39.849]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:24:39.849 --> 00:24:44.132]  But a large part of the public is in a trance state, basically.
[00:24:44.132 --> 00:24:45.533]  They watch television all day.
[00:24:45.533 --> 00:24:46.014]  They're in a
[00:24:51.144 --> 00:24:54.086]  I guess you'd use the word sleepwalking.
[00:24:54.086 --> 00:24:55.588]  Mode.
[00:24:55.588 --> 00:24:56.088]  Physically.
[00:24:56.088 --> 00:25:00.011]  That's not a term I'm using.
[00:25:00.011 --> 00:25:01.493]  They're in a dream state.
[00:25:01.493 --> 00:25:03.915]  They're daydreaming.
[00:25:03.915 --> 00:25:09.259]  We are living in a dystopic science fiction reality.
[00:25:09.259 --> 00:25:11.241]  And it's about to all get a lot worse.
[00:25:11.241 --> 00:25:16.045]  Because everything that's been set up so far was just the beta testing and the preparations.
[00:25:17.418 --> 00:25:22.266]  The New World Order is going operational as we speak on every front.
[00:25:22.266 --> 00:25:27.314]  They have now commenced their soft kill
[00:25:28.936 --> 00:25:37.022]  They are intensifying their electronic warfare systems through the televisions and through other wavelengths.
[00:25:37.022 --> 00:25:52.854]  They are openly announcing that they're going to, quote, calm us with the new light bulbs that have supersonic flicker rates that the eye cannot even catch but are perceivable in the brain through the optic nerves.
[00:25:59.119 --> 00:26:01.802]  It is the equivalent of a deep space alien attack.
[00:26:01.802 --> 00:26:04.424]  I just, there's no other way to describe it.
[00:26:04.424 --> 00:26:13.453]  Real aliens would not come to the planet and sit there like in a movie like War of the Worlds shooting laser beams at people and grabbing folks with big tentacles and eating them, okay?
[00:26:13.453 --> 00:26:15.835]  Wouldn't be like that.
[00:26:15.835 --> 00:26:17.257]  It would be like what you're seeing right here.
[00:26:17.257 --> 00:26:21.341]  The trees would be programmed genetically to start poisoning everyone.
[00:26:22.827 --> 00:26:26.130]  The crops would be changed to slowly kill you.
[00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:35.780]  You would slowly be given more and more high dosages of poison through the shots in the water until you're so drugged out and so mindless you don't even see what's coming.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:43.287]  There'd be fabulous distractions and social engineering to manipulate you.
[00:26:43.287 --> 00:26:46.109]  And no, I don't believe, as I've said, that it's aliens from a distant planet.
[00:26:47.173 --> 00:27:09.470]  It's psychopaths that have used the incredible power of the human mind and the incredible human power to build what we envision to take the greatest developments that our species has created and then to weld it together into this system we're now entering and it is a nightmare dystopia.
[00:27:11.032 --> 00:27:13.233]  The likes of which the world has never seen.
[00:27:13.233 --> 00:27:17.295]  And I get why a lot of people can't handle this show.
[00:27:17.295 --> 00:27:21.517]  There are a lot of people that have worked here over the years that just say, look, I know a lot of this stuff's true.
[00:27:21.517 --> 00:27:23.118]  And I'll go, no, it's all true.
[00:27:23.118 --> 00:27:26.059]  They'll go, whatever, I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:27:26.059 --> 00:27:27.760]  And I get it.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.541]  Folks want to just go imagine that we're not being taken over.
[00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:33.562]  They want to just go and imagine there's not a plan to destroy the family.
[00:27:33.562 --> 00:27:36.684]  They want to go and imagine the tap water's fine.
[00:27:36.684 --> 00:27:39.125]  They want to go quietly into that sweet night, and that's fine because
[00:27:41.132 --> 00:27:47.376]  They can't handle the truth.
[00:27:47.376 --> 00:27:50.278]  And I'm not sure I can handle it either.
[00:27:50.278 --> 00:27:53.120]  But I know what I'm looking at, and I know what they're doing.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.601]  I've read their writings.
[00:27:55.601 --> 00:28:05.247]  I read stuff that Galton, and the Wedgwoods, and the Huxleys, and the Darwins wrote 160 years ago.
[00:28:05.247 --> 00:28:07.168]  170 years ago, some of it.
[00:28:07.168 --> 00:28:09.530]  And man, if those people didn't build our world,
[00:28:12.463 --> 00:28:16.525]  They envisioned everything.
[00:28:16.525 --> 00:28:20.387]  They said that DNA would be discovered and had a double helix.
[00:28:20.387 --> 00:28:24.409]  Oh, you notice the snakes going back 6,000 years are a DNA double helix.
[00:28:24.409 --> 00:28:26.229]  The truth is it was all discovered before.
[00:28:26.229 --> 00:28:30.752]  The truth is these secret society families already know.
[00:28:30.752 --> 00:28:36.374]  The truth is there was a civilization before this, every ancient culture says, it's called Atlantis.
[00:28:36.374 --> 00:28:37.575]  And it was all blown away.
[00:28:39.619 --> 00:28:42.981]  Plato's history book talks about it.
[00:28:42.981 --> 00:28:49.165]  It was out in the Atlantic Ocean in the entrance of the Mediterranean.
[00:28:49.165 --> 00:28:58.731]  It's exploding to be seen thousands of miles away.
[00:28:58.731 --> 00:29:04.675]  There wasn't sunshiny days for three years there was so much dust in the air.
[00:29:04.675 --> 00:29:08.257]  When whatever it is blew up or whatever it was slammed in.
[00:29:10.677 --> 00:29:18.361]  And I've reverse-engineered all this, reading the history books, the ancient legends, all of it, because the elite have data and knowledge.
[00:29:18.361 --> 00:29:20.022]  They knew the world was round.
[00:29:20.022 --> 00:29:24.524]  They knew that there was a passage to, not to India, but to the New World.
[00:29:24.524 --> 00:29:27.225]  The Vikings knew that a thousand years before on record.
[00:29:27.225 --> 00:29:29.366]  They knew thousands of years before that.
[00:29:29.366 --> 00:29:32.168]  And that's what I'm getting at here is this whole system
[00:29:33.979 --> 00:29:37.321]  Is about keeping us from discovering what's actually going on.
[00:29:37.321 --> 00:29:39.743]  The elites know the secrets.
[00:29:39.743 --> 00:29:42.104]  And they're trying to keep them from us to keep control.
[00:29:42.104 --> 00:29:42.604]  We'll be back.
[00:29:42.604 --> 00:29:42.985]  Stay with us.
[00:29:42.985 --> 00:29:47.928]  I'm gonna get into the campaign and the rest of it.
[00:29:47.928 --> 00:29:49.309]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.309 --> 00:29:51.850]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:54.532]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.527 --> 00:30:03.769]  President Obama is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors you may not know about, until now.
[00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:09.491]  For one thing, he illegally gave Obamacare exemptions to unions that supported the passage of Obamacare.
[00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:14.992]  That's right, Obama gave some of his favorite organizations exemption from some of Obamacare's requirements.
[00:30:14.992 --> 00:30:19.834]  Because many of them were unions and other groups that pressured the public to support the socialist program.
[00:30:20.214 --> 00:30:28.763]  Once these groups realized just how bad Obamacare really was, they wanted exemptions from the very same law they forced on everyone else, which Obama gave them.
[00:30:28.763 --> 00:30:34.429]  President Obama also had the IRS grant special illegal favors for his brother's so-called charity.
[00:30:34.429 --> 00:30:42.798]  The Daily Caller reported the IRS had taken the unprecedented step of approving a non-profit application within just one month from the Barack H. Obama Foundation.
[00:30:43.038 --> 00:30:48.626]  Additionally, the IRS illegally gave retroactive approval for the organization's tax exempt status.
[00:30:48.626 --> 00:30:55.537]  You can find out more from the article on InfoWars.com entitled, 75 Times Obama Broke Law During Presidency.
[00:30:55.537 --> 00:30:56.959]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:30:58.564 --> 00:31:02.086]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:31:02.086 --> 00:31:10.331]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:31:10.331 --> 00:31:15.755]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:33:09.847 --> 00:33:23.351]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:23.351 --> 00:33:33.033]  Alright, we will be covering more, dealing with the breakaways, civilization of the globalist rebuilding, exactly what that means.
[00:33:33.033 --> 00:33:35.934]  I'm going to go into reports looking at the writings
[00:33:38.681 --> 00:33:48.870]  of the British technocracy and how they basically envision the modern world that was built in the 1850s.
[00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:52.133]  Then through their mouthpiece H.G.
[00:33:52.133 --> 00:34:02.743]  Wells by 1900 they were openly putting the information out in the novel form as predictive programming to prepare the public for what they were going to construct.
[00:34:04.895 --> 00:34:13.100]  So what I'm getting at here is the public can't deal with FEMA camps that are real and admitted.
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:25.788]  The public can't deal with the fact that fluoride massively grows tumors, and even the FDA and EPA have said for 16 years, take it out of the water.
[00:34:25.788 --> 00:34:29.270]  The public, on average, doesn't even know that.
[00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:32.733]  The public, until a few years ago, didn't know the Federal Reserve was private.
[00:34:32.733 --> 00:34:33.373]  Run for profit.
[00:34:39.895 --> 00:34:44.018]  So we've gotten over some major hurdles.
[00:34:44.018 --> 00:34:54.105]  But now that the public realizes they're being lied to, it's time for the public to really understand the true global structure.
[00:34:54.105 --> 00:35:08.656]  And the way the establishment is countering that is to put out all these other theories and things that aren't true or aren't provable to confuse and basically sabotage
[00:35:10.575 --> 00:35:15.238]  The general public actually discovering the real narrative.
[00:35:15.238 --> 00:35:30.326]  High-tech elites, robber barons, hiring the top scientific minds in Europe, England, Scotland, the United States, Russia, Serbia, Croatia.
[00:35:30.326 --> 00:35:33.388]  A lot of the top minds come out of there.
[00:35:33.388 --> 00:35:37.210]  Super geniuses in that area, statistically.
[00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:37.951]  Hiring them,
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.403]  To develop and build the future.
[00:35:46.403 --> 00:35:49.025]  Much bigger than the Manhattan Project.
[00:35:49.025 --> 00:35:52.047]  By an order of hundreds of times.
[00:35:52.047 --> 00:35:57.371]  What does Hillary Clinton call the spy grid she wants to build?
[00:35:57.371 --> 00:35:59.092]  And the internet control system?
[00:35:59.092 --> 00:36:01.114]  She calls it a giant Manhattan Project.
[00:36:02.745 --> 00:36:03.826]  And that's what we're facing.
[00:36:03.826 --> 00:36:10.610]  And I'm just here reading their own literature, studying the science, to see what they're building and to see what they say it's for.
[00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:22.318]  And they say it's to make us obsolete, to bring in machines, and to wipe us out.
[00:36:22.318 --> 00:36:31.484]  So I go see a movie like Tin Cloverfield, and it's so much deeper.
[00:36:34.704 --> 00:36:43.771]  than what the general public would get from that film and that novel.
[00:36:43.771 --> 00:36:56.421]  By the way, in World War II, for four years, one year into World War II, the British had cracked the entire German code.
[00:36:56.421 --> 00:37:01.005]  Before World War II, the blue and purple codes of the Japanese were all broken.
[00:37:01.005 --> 00:37:02.446]  That's been declassified by the 60s.
[00:37:03.783 --> 00:37:06.805]  They waited until the 60s.
[00:37:06.805 --> 00:37:11.208]  They had the Russian codes deciphered, you name it.
[00:37:11.208 --> 00:37:14.290]  But they didn't tell them they had them deciphered.
[00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:17.512]  They have all the encryption keys.
[00:37:17.512 --> 00:37:19.293]  They have all the back doors.
[00:37:19.293 --> 00:37:27.178]  There have been a few sat phone companies and groups, there was one in Canada, who wouldn't give them back doors.
[00:37:27.178 --> 00:37:29.020]  Those people end up dead in their swimming pools.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.942]  And the company gets shut down.
[00:37:31.942 --> 00:37:39.748]  There's nothing out there that's widespread, that's off the shelf, that's widely used, that isn't backdoored.
[00:37:39.748 --> 00:37:45.432]  They're having this debate to get you to accept that they're spying on you for your safety.
[00:37:45.432 --> 00:37:51.036]  I was watching Fox News this morning and CNN back and forth and it was the same script.
[00:37:51.036 --> 00:37:54.139]  The French want to arrest any computer executives that don't give them
[00:37:55.225 --> 00:38:05.690]  Backdoors, and there's this new telegram thing that's being used on iPhones, and then ISIS is using it to launch attacks, and so we've got to have the backdoor to it.
[00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:07.771]  Our government is run by criminal groups.
[00:38:07.771 --> 00:38:09.111]  They run ISIS.
[00:38:09.111 --> 00:38:11.212]  They're even showing footage on Fox of U.S.
[00:38:11.212 --> 00:38:14.834]  armored vehicles with ISIS waving flags and U.S.
[00:38:14.834 --> 00:38:18.335]  Toyota trucks that they always show, and they were waving M16s, M4s,
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:29.904]  There they are in their US and NATO equipped weapons.
[00:38:29.904 --> 00:38:34.467]  Turkey backs them, Saudi Arabia backs them, and there they are with the generals on Fox News.
[00:38:37.745 --> 00:38:42.247]  That particular is a Russian tank, but a bunch of their equipment is U.S.
[00:38:42.247 --> 00:38:43.568]  armored vehicles.
[00:38:43.568 --> 00:38:54.232]  And they're riding around, they're rumbling around in front of everyone, funded by our government, given stinger missiles by our government, and then they look at us and they go, we've got to stop the threat.
[00:38:54.232 --> 00:38:56.973]  We've got to have all your encryption.
[00:38:56.973 --> 00:39:00.875]  What they're really saying is, we're spying on you for your own good, your own safety.
[00:39:00.875 --> 00:39:02.576]  They're just making it acceptable.
[00:39:06.294 --> 00:39:33.426]  Now I want to get to the latest Donald Trump news here, and the latest attacks on free speech, but the good news is, I'd play it but it's in French, Jean-Claude Van Damme, it was Kurt Russell, you know, a month and a half ago, it's so many of these Hollywood people, back when I would still go out to Hollywood occasionally to be on a TV show or be in a little movie or something, I would get invited to some of these parties and
[00:39:35.911 --> 00:39:37.752]  Almost everyone was anti-vaccine.
[00:39:37.752 --> 00:39:39.733]  Almost everyone was really pro-gun.
[00:39:39.733 --> 00:39:52.000]  Almost everyone told me that they were scared of Sumner Redstone and the big chiefs who made them go out and be liberal or they'd be blackballed.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:00.124]  And so, so many of those big names you see go up and talk about global warming and talk about man-made global warming and that push all this.
[00:40:00.124 --> 00:40:04.086]  They're actors and they know it's a fraud and they can't stand it.
[00:40:10.666 --> 00:40:12.608]  You can even see the look in their eyes when they get up there and do it.
[00:40:12.608 --> 00:40:14.169]  They all know it's baloney.
[00:40:14.169 --> 00:40:18.893]  And it's not that they're tuning into what I'm saying, they're just tuning into the real world, and there it is.
[00:40:18.893 --> 00:40:27.040]  So you go read the transcript of what Jean-Claude Van Damme said, and it's directly from this broadcast.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:31.644]  But it's not because, again, I've got all the answers, it's true!
[00:40:31.644 --> 00:40:35.667]  And he describes since the early 1800s how the Rothschilds took over Europe,
[00:40:36.573 --> 00:40:47.723]  How they set up basically Napoleon, all the things that are historical, how they've set up a planetary government, how globalism plays the nation-states off against each other, and if we get rid of globalism, we'll have freedom.
[00:40:47.723 --> 00:40:50.045]  And a great new renaissance.
[00:40:50.045 --> 00:40:53.287]  I mean, go read it for yourself!
[00:40:53.287 --> 00:40:55.249]  He speaks decent English.
[00:40:55.249 --> 00:40:57.311]  We really should push.
[00:40:57.311 --> 00:41:02.295]  Not that we like to get celebrities on, because just to get a celebrity on and talk about the price of tea in China, who cares?
[00:41:02.295 --> 00:41:04.037]  You know, Christopher Walken was on the show once.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.160]  I was told a few days before, yeah, Walken, here's the show.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.081]  He likes the show, but he didn't want to get political.
[00:41:09.081 --> 00:41:12.681]  And he's going to just show up, you know, during the Skype interview.
[00:41:12.681 --> 00:41:17.622]  And then he shows up, wants to talk about red wine and cooking chicken.
[00:41:17.622 --> 00:41:20.283]  And after bringing up politics, he goes, I'm not going to do it, Alex.
[00:41:20.283 --> 00:41:22.183]  And, you know, he was on like 10 minutes.
[00:41:22.183 --> 00:41:23.343]  See, there was no thrill.
[00:41:23.343 --> 00:41:24.404]  I like Christopher Walken.
[00:41:24.404 --> 00:41:26.124]  He's a very interesting actor.
[00:41:26.124 --> 00:41:29.124]  But, you know, I could really care less.
[00:41:29.124 --> 00:41:31.805]  You know, about going to a farmhouse and eating chicken with him.
[00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:45.429]  I don't want to lay around in Hollywood, you know, while there's fires a mile away and ashes falling on me, you know, sitting there having a butler bring me a martini.
[00:41:45.429 --> 00:41:51.712]  That isn't fulfilling, driving around in a $200,000 Mercedes Maybach.
[00:41:51.712 --> 00:41:53.592]  People would sell their soul for that.
[00:41:53.592 --> 00:41:56.173]  It means nothing!
[00:41:56.173 --> 00:41:58.054]  Nothing!
[00:41:58.054 --> 00:42:02.956]  But this is the whole world enthralled just for the petty trinkets.
[00:42:04.713 --> 00:42:06.074]  And it's not even about the luxury.
[00:42:06.074 --> 00:42:07.334]  It's not even about the security.
[00:42:07.334 --> 00:42:12.857]  I can see wealth for security and to help others.
[00:42:12.857 --> 00:42:19.601]  It's about being insecure and wanting to project that you're big and powerful to other people.
[00:42:19.601 --> 00:42:31.487]  So people are selling out to feel like they're accepted and like they've arrived.
[00:42:31.487 --> 00:42:33.728]  But then you have somebody like Jean-Claude Van Damme coming out
[00:42:36.141 --> 00:42:43.445]  Saying there's a world government, it's run by globalists, Trump isn't owned by them, that's why they hate him, they're coming after him, they're destroying the nation states, on and on and on.
[00:42:43.445 --> 00:42:45.206]  He gets it.
[00:42:45.206 --> 00:42:59.773]  And when the paradigm shifts, and people look to the actual controllers, and the fact that they're basically tax-exempt, that they've got armed guards but don't want us to be able to have guns and protect ourselves, when it came out that Piers Morgan had armed bodyguards,
[00:43:02.418 --> 00:43:04.979]  Basically, his show had cancelled itself.
[00:43:04.979 --> 00:43:07.580]  No one was watching, because people fundamentally get it.
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:21.965]  So, this is just more proof coming in on a weekly basis, that I don't care if it's Japanese entertainment people, or French, or German, or British, or Irish, or US, or Mexican, you name it.
[00:43:21.965 --> 00:43:29.228]  In the real intelligentsia, you just see that being mirrored now, coming out of Hollywood.
[00:43:29.228 --> 00:43:31.649]  But in real intelligentsia, everybody knows this stuff.
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:37.242]  With truly informed people, this is just known.
[00:43:37.242 --> 00:43:44.706]  Like the Atlantic Ocean is on the east coast of the US, on the west coast of Europe.
[00:43:44.706 --> 00:43:48.708]  It's just known.
[00:43:48.708 --> 00:43:52.710]  Like fluoride causes cancer.
[00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:53.610]  Type it in.
[00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:56.592]  Type it into a search engine.
[00:43:56.592 --> 00:43:59.433]  EPA says remove fluoride from the water.
[00:43:59.433 --> 00:44:00.814]  The feds came in and complained.
[00:44:01.957 --> 00:44:05.279]  The chemical makers, they said, okay, cut it in half.
[00:44:05.279 --> 00:44:06.300]  That was three years ago.
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:12.264]  They haven't cut it in half in your water.
[00:44:12.264 --> 00:44:19.068]  Even the American Dental Association, for six years, says don't have children under six brush their teeth with fluoride toothpaste.
[00:44:19.068 --> 00:44:21.590]  It causes dental fluorosis and bone cancer.
[00:44:22.665 --> 00:44:27.426]  I tell people that and they laugh at me and say, what are you, a dentist?
[00:44:27.426 --> 00:44:31.007]  And I go, well, my dad is a retired oral surgeon, yes, but I can go to U.S.
[00:44:31.007 --> 00:44:39.288]  Food and Drug Administration, health claim notification for fluoride water and reduce risk of dental carriers.
[00:44:39.288 --> 00:44:44.669]  Just type in EPA, FDA says cut fluoride in water and you'll see it, it's like Reuters.
[00:44:44.669 --> 00:44:49.330]  All right, let me get to the other news here, the whole Trump situation.
[00:44:51.974 --> 00:44:57.575]  Before I do that, I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:44:57.575 --> 00:44:58.595]  Now, there's Leningradium.
[00:44:58.595 --> 00:44:59.695]  Fluoride causes cancer.
[00:44:59.695 --> 00:45:02.396]  It's been known forever.
[00:45:02.396 --> 00:45:07.357]  I mean, they knew it at the turn of the last century.
[00:45:07.357 --> 00:45:12.178]  24 hours only, 30 to 40% off in full or select storable food.
[00:45:12.178 --> 00:45:13.218]  It's powered by MyPatriot.
[00:45:13.218 --> 00:45:16.659]  It's the exact same, freshly packed, super high quality food.
[00:45:16.659 --> 00:45:18.079]  It's probably the lowest prices out there.
[00:45:19.677 --> 00:45:28.736]  And we basically, when we sell at this price, there's basically like 10% profit instead of 30-40% profit, which is still really inexpensive for storable food to have some profit.
[00:45:28.736 --> 00:45:29.978]  We've got to have profit to operate.
[00:45:31.227 --> 00:45:33.329]  But we do these loss leaders a couple times a year.
[00:45:33.329 --> 00:45:40.815]  For the next 24 hours only, we're giving you 30 to 40 percent off, depending on the package, the retail price of all-in-four select swearable foods at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:45:40.815 --> 00:45:46.099]  All-in-four select foods have a shelf life of 25 years and are made and packaged in the USA and taste great.
[00:45:46.099 --> 00:45:49.542]  Food prices are going up around the world, so now is the time to start getting prepared.
[00:45:49.542 --> 00:45:54.646]  30 to 40 percent off all-in-four select swearable foods on InfoWarsTore.com for the next 24 hours only.
[00:45:56.917 --> 00:45:59.459]  Also, Supermel Vitality is back in stock.
[00:45:59.459 --> 00:46:01.601]  Secure yours before supplies run out.
[00:46:01.601 --> 00:46:06.766]  Supermel Vitality is back in a limited run, and now is the time to secure your bottle before we sell out once again.
[00:46:06.766 --> 00:46:12.131]  Yeah, we got a limited supply, and a big shipment should be coming in in about three weeks, but it's probably going to sell out again.
[00:46:12.131 --> 00:46:15.494]  Once we sell out, it could be months before we're able to secure another shipment.
[00:46:15.494 --> 00:46:17.375]  We think it's three weeks to a month, but who knows.
[00:46:17.375 --> 00:46:19.958]  This ultra-strength formula contains organic herbs and acids.
[00:46:20.478 --> 00:46:21.239]  That are the real deal.
[00:46:21.239 --> 00:46:28.123]  Visit InfoWarsLive.com and order your Supermetal Vitality today before we sell out and you're supporting the broadcast as well.
[00:46:28.123 --> 00:46:32.406]  InfoWarsLive.com is where you find our nutraceuticals specifically.
[00:46:32.406 --> 00:46:38.330]  Cousin Vinny in Kansas says, no side effects, produces results, simple to take.
[00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:42.894]  You won't, you don't want to know the details.
[00:46:42.894 --> 00:46:46.016]  Suffice it to say it has revived my interest in my wife.
[00:46:47.199 --> 00:46:52.744]  Yeah, and that's not what it's really sold as doing, but it's what people notice the quickest.
[00:46:52.744 --> 00:46:58.349]  And if you're not having a problem in that department, I still notice it.
[00:46:58.349 --> 00:46:59.811]  And I've been honest about it.
[00:46:59.811 --> 00:47:02.793]  You know, I was 40, went in and got a checkup, came back in 41.
[00:47:02.793 --> 00:47:05.816]  The doc just said that's what medical doctors do.
[00:47:05.816 --> 00:47:09.740]  He said, oh, you're doing pretty good, blah, blah, blah, your sugar's a little high, things like that.
[00:47:12.011 --> 00:47:13.293]  You want some Cialis?
[00:47:13.293 --> 00:47:14.374]  And I said, you know, I don't really need that.
[00:47:14.374 --> 00:47:16.377]  He goes, well, this stuff lasts all day.
[00:47:16.377 --> 00:47:18.940]  Just take a bottle, see if you like it.
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:21.123]  So I gave him a prescription.
[00:47:21.123 --> 00:47:26.209]  And really, that was a little something.
[00:47:26.209 --> 00:47:29.473]  I can tell you personally, with Supramel Vitality and Anthroplex,
[00:47:31.451 --> 00:47:35.114]  It works so well that, quite frankly, I can't even take the two of them together.
[00:47:35.114 --> 00:47:41.178]  And they both do different things, but they're similar, and some of the formulas are the same, but both of them have some different stuff in them.
[00:47:41.178 --> 00:47:43.180]  I think you should take them together.
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:47.123]  But if you're like me and Artie are bouncing off the walls, maybe not.
[00:47:47.123 --> 00:47:51.566]  Because I'll tell you right now, Anthroplex makes me meaner than a rattlesnake.
[00:47:51.566 --> 00:47:52.867]  I'll just tell you right now.
[00:47:52.867 --> 00:47:54.208]  It definitely works.
[00:47:54.208 --> 00:47:56.690]  I mean, whoa!
[00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:58.292]  So does Supermail, so does Superfemale.
[00:47:58.292 --> 00:47:59.953]  Do yourself a favor, get a model today.

[00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:26.590]  InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:26.730]  Okay.
[00:48:32.102 --> 00:48:34.984]  I've talked about kind of the big picture again, and I can't control myself.
[00:48:34.984 --> 00:48:42.389]  I kind of restate it different ways and tie it into the new news every day because we're under attack.
[00:48:42.389 --> 00:48:44.451]  We've been taken over by criminals.
[00:48:44.451 --> 00:48:49.614]  They're waging war against our self-sufficiency, against our families, against our very species.
[00:48:49.614 --> 00:48:51.236]  They want men to be alone and bitter.
[00:48:51.236 --> 00:48:53.857]  They want women to be alone and bitter.
[00:48:53.857 --> 00:48:54.818]  People grow up.
[00:48:54.818 --> 00:48:55.759]  They become trendy.
[00:48:55.759 --> 00:48:57.820]  They try to act cool socially.
[00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:58.701]  There are no jobs.
[00:48:58.701 --> 00:49:00.042]  There isn't a future for most people.
[00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:05.493]  The trendy guys they date don't deliver, they get bitter.
[00:49:05.493 --> 00:49:09.775]  Then the state becomes their husband, because it teaches them to hate men.
[00:49:09.775 --> 00:49:11.376]  Girl power!
[00:49:11.376 --> 00:49:12.537]  Girl power!
[00:49:12.537 --> 00:49:16.339]  Then the guys are just off drunk at the sports bar.
[00:49:16.339 --> 00:49:18.420]  Arrested Development never become men.
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:19.781]  This is where we're going.
[00:49:19.781 --> 00:49:22.583]  This is what we've become.
[00:49:22.583 --> 00:49:29.367]  And then somebody like Donald Trump gets up there, like an old silverback gorilla, crossed with a golden-haired
[00:49:31.877 --> 00:49:38.271]  I mean that affectionately, but the archetypal big male, you know, gorilla up there with a confident look on frowning.
[00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:45.395]  And if you look at chimpanzee or ape faces and what they mean, you look at Homo sapiens, it's basically the same thing in Telegraphs.
[00:49:45.395 --> 00:49:49.678]  Telegraphs, I'm super cool, I'm super tough, I don't have to move for anybody.
[00:49:49.678 --> 00:49:57.004]  The female, you know, apes are there picking bugs and stuff off of him while he sits there with them bringing him, you know, bananas to eat.
[00:49:57.004 --> 00:49:58.726]  That's what he projects.
[00:49:58.726 --> 00:50:04.991]  And that makes the globalists so mad because they're trying to end that John Wayne image of the confident male.
[00:50:09.096 --> 00:50:10.317]  And they're just waging war.
[00:50:10.317 --> 00:50:12.537]  I mean, how dare he say we could have borders?
[00:50:12.537 --> 00:50:14.618]  How dare he say we can't bring in jihadists?
[00:50:14.618 --> 00:50:19.280]  How dare he say that we, you know, China can't have a giant internal tariff on us?
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:22.561]  And the Chinese government comes in and says, you shut your mouth and do what we say!
[00:50:22.561 --> 00:50:33.465]  And the British government, and the Mexican government, and Bill Clinton, and Hillary, and Ted Cruz comes out and says it's Donald's fault there were problems in Chicago and Ohio.
[00:50:33.465 --> 00:50:37.967]  It's his fault George Soros admits and MoveOn.org admits they sent those people in to attack.
[00:50:39.215 --> 00:50:41.677]  I've watched the videos, just like we had at the abortion protest.
[00:50:41.677 --> 00:50:50.905]  Let's cue that up, where they link hands, run into you, and say, excuse us, coming through, excuse us, and then they turn around and say, we attack them.
[00:50:50.905 --> 00:50:53.547]  That's how these people operate.
[00:50:53.547 --> 00:50:55.909]  I'm Alex Jones, stay with me, InfoWars.com.

[00:54:17.532 --> 00:54:18.473]  I saw the photograph.
[00:54:18.473 --> 00:54:26.717]  By the way... My son last week took a photo of a big double rainbow.
[00:54:39.292 --> 00:54:41.113]  Out in the Texas Hill Country.
[00:54:41.113 --> 00:54:45.015]  And I just tweeted that out at Real Alex Jones.
[00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:53.319]  And before I did it, I thought, oh my gosh, if I just say, look at this beautiful double rainbow, people will ask me, what am I doing pushing the gay agenda?
[00:54:53.319 --> 00:55:02.623]  And you see, that's another example of how every sacred symbol, archetypal symbol, has been expropriated by the social engineers.
[00:55:02.623 --> 00:55:06.705]  Even the word gay just means a happy, beautiful time.
[00:55:06.705 --> 00:55:08.266]  But now I can't use that word
[00:55:09.682 --> 00:55:14.026]  In relation to a beautiful day or a great time.
[00:55:14.026 --> 00:55:17.349]  Or if somebody was a nice young man, say he was a gay lad.
[00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:20.292]  Because the social engineers have expropriated it.
[00:55:20.292 --> 00:55:24.456]  And under political correctness, they're taking every word.
[00:55:24.456 --> 00:55:26.398]  Torres Seinfeld's daughter is 13 years old.
[00:55:26.398 --> 00:55:27.779]  They go, honey, we live out in the country.
[00:55:27.779 --> 00:55:30.441]  We're going to move back into New York so you can meet more boys and more friends.
[00:55:30.441 --> 00:55:32.904]  She goes, you don't say the word boys!
[00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:35.431]  And her dad said, you're ignorant.
[00:55:35.431 --> 00:55:37.331]  That's not sexist or bad.
[00:55:37.331 --> 00:55:38.692]  She goes, yes it is.
[00:55:38.692 --> 00:55:43.034]  Because at her level of school, it is.
[00:55:43.034 --> 00:55:46.596]  And the older left is meant to freak out by that and go, oh my gosh, we're for free speech.
[00:55:46.596 --> 00:55:48.657]  And Obama makes jokes about it.
[00:55:48.657 --> 00:55:49.897]  And Bill Maher makes jokes about it.
[00:55:49.897 --> 00:55:51.518]  But this is the plan.
[00:55:51.518 --> 00:55:54.459]  To create basket cases.
[00:55:54.459 --> 00:55:56.020]  I call it a cult because it is a cult.
[00:56:01.428 --> 00:56:02.168]  They don't work.
[00:56:02.168 --> 00:56:04.429]  They don't know how to tie their shoes or cook a meal.
[00:56:04.429 --> 00:56:10.871]  They know how to take selfies and be offended and be in mindless groups.
[00:56:10.871 --> 00:56:21.754]  And then as social justice warriors, like the guy that tried to physically attack Donald Trump that said he wanted to kill him, he went to the rally with a bunch of young women.
[00:56:21.754 --> 00:56:23.614]  He was their big hero.
[00:56:23.614 --> 00:56:26.175]  The big man who's going to stop free speech.
[00:56:27.278 --> 00:56:34.523]  Because he's such a liberal, they're gonna try to attack Donald Trump, and they have this weird Nelly guy on CNN as a hero.
[00:56:34.523 --> 00:56:42.848]  CNN gives airtime to a guy who admitted he wanted to murder Trump, and reportedly put out jihad tweets and stuff.
[00:56:42.848 --> 00:56:51.033]  And I saw in Kurt Nemo's article, it showed all these Muslim groups there running over people and stuff, and this is what they did.
[00:56:51.033 --> 00:56:56.437]  And then when the cops show up, when the cops showed up at the abortion clinic, I'm gonna go back out there soon,
[00:56:58.186 --> 00:57:09.173]  They tell the cops, oh, Alex Jones attacked us, and then the cops come over, we show the cops the footage, they go, okay, put them in handcuffs, but then their bosses tell them, don't take them to jail.
[00:57:09.173 --> 00:57:13.576]  And these are people on boards at UT that are going to be on the police review board.
[00:57:13.576 --> 00:57:18.098]  And the police won't even do their job with people like this.
[00:57:18.098 --> 00:57:22.001]  And the founder of Black Lives Matter lives in Cuba and is a cop killer.
[00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:29.502]  And again, the left loves police giving Patriots tickets all day and raising revenue.
[00:57:29.502 --> 00:57:33.024]  But when they're done with their takeover, they're coming after you, too.
[00:57:33.024 --> 00:57:35.085]  Because there's a lawlessness to these people.
[00:57:35.085 --> 00:57:40.106]  They want to overthrow their revolutionaries.
[00:57:40.106 --> 00:57:41.407]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this.
[00:57:41.407 --> 00:57:46.449]  Radio listeners go to Infowars.com forward slash show to see the free feed.
[00:57:46.449 --> 00:57:47.709]  Here's a clip of last year.
[00:57:47.709 --> 00:57:49.670]  They link arms, run into us.
[00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:51.631]  They also ran to folks on crutches, you name it.
[00:57:52.927 --> 00:57:54.048]  Go ahead and play the audio, too.
[00:57:54.048 --> 00:57:55.409]  Here it is.
[00:57:55.409 --> 00:58:05.875]  The very people who want to literally wipe out black Americans through Planned Parenthood on record are the ones trying to create this whole race war and garbage off some of these tragedies.
[00:58:05.875 --> 00:58:10.138]  We're pointing out the real organized genocide with the documented proof.
[00:58:10.138 --> 00:58:11.619]  We're talking to a lot of great folks.
[00:58:11.619 --> 00:58:13.280]  Sir, give us your take on all this.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:16.482]  Yeah, I think that we're going to continue forward as a country.
[00:58:24.948 --> 00:58:26.870]  Now this happens five or six times.
[00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:31.893]  This was just one time where they run into you from behind with their arms linked and then if you push back
[00:58:32.802 --> 00:58:34.344]  They say on the news you attacked them.
[00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:36.205]  They're now doing it to Trump's campaign head.
[00:58:36.205 --> 00:58:38.568]  We're going to cover that when we come back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:38.568 --> 00:58:41.690]  The campaign head, the woman brushes into him.
[00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:45.554]  She told the news she fell down and he attacked her with Megyn Kelly.
[00:58:45.554 --> 00:58:48.377]  Lying packs of enemy filth.
[00:58:48.377 --> 00:58:52.721]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:58:53.001 --> 00:58:57.763]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:58:57.763 --> 00:58:59.084]  Talk about the effects.
[00:58:59.084 --> 00:59:00.605]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:59:00.605 --> 00:59:02.525]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:59:02.525 --> 00:59:03.646]  I feel like I look better.
[00:59:03.646 --> 00:59:04.346]  I feel better.
[00:59:04.346 --> 00:59:05.407]  I feel sexier.
[00:59:05.407 --> 00:59:06.387]  I love it.
[00:59:06.387 --> 00:59:09.369]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:59:09.369 --> 00:59:12.050]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[00:59:12.290 --> 00:59:13.351]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:59:13.351 --> 00:59:14.551]  Consult your physician.
[00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:16.933]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:59:16.933 --> 00:59:18.274]  This is life-changing.
[00:59:18.274 --> 00:59:19.194]  Shower filters.
[00:59:19.194 --> 00:59:20.915]  We're introducing the best yet.
[00:59:20.915 --> 00:59:24.977]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[00:59:24.977 --> 00:59:29.800]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:36.864]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[00:59:36.864 --> 00:59:39.826]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free shipping
[00:59:40.346 --> 00:59:41.567]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:07.513 --> 01:00:11.744]  Another time in the age of wonder.
[01:00:26.886 --> 01:00:31.528]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:31.528 --> 01:00:37.491]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:48.382]  We have some videos that Josh Owens has shot on the campaign trail.
[01:00:48.382 --> 01:00:57.385]  We'll have Richard and him reporting, obviously, Wednesday with the next big primary on the Nightly News, but also here on the radio slash TV transmission, 11 a.m.
[01:00:57.385 --> 01:00:59.025]  to 3 p.m.
[01:00:59.025 --> 01:01:04.407]  But there's very powerful footage that Owens is just out there shooting.
[01:01:05.794 --> 01:01:13.599]  Where the Black Lives Matter folks who aren't hired thugs, they're just hired to then get reasonable people to buy into it to show up.
[01:01:13.599 --> 01:01:15.301]  It's a snowball effect.
[01:01:15.301 --> 01:01:29.611]  And then when the Trump supporters actually hug and embrace the folks, they go from looking like they're angry and want to fight, you know, to just, you know, really getting along and being very loving.
[01:01:29.611 --> 01:01:31.372]  And that's what's going to defeat the new world order.
[01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:40.376]  That's why Hillary's trying to basically scapegoat and set up Bernie Sanders people so that he gets demonized for shutting down free speech.
[01:01:40.376 --> 01:01:41.777]  And I'm not defending Sanders.
[01:01:41.777 --> 01:01:43.558]  It's just move on, Soros.
[01:01:43.558 --> 01:01:44.799]  They've taken responsibility.
[01:01:44.799 --> 01:01:47.301]  They're running the whole thing.
[01:01:47.301 --> 01:01:53.005]  And these Black Lives Matter folks cannot believe that people want to shake their hands and don't hate them.
[01:01:53.005 --> 01:01:55.347]  Because I personally know black people.
[01:01:56.181 --> 01:01:58.622]  I have a really good Hispanic friend going back.
[01:02:21.519 --> 01:02:21.799]  I don't know.
[01:02:21.799 --> 01:02:23.819]  It's got to be 20 years.
[01:02:23.819 --> 01:02:27.940]  And this guy has made millions of dollars in business.
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:29.260]  He's a really smart guy.
[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:36.562]  And I'm not going to get into his business or what he does because he's actually known on the show just a little bit.
[01:02:36.562 --> 01:02:46.643]  And I mean, this is probably like 10 years ago in a middle class neighborhood, not a fancy four bedroom house, lower middle class neighborhood where I was living at the time.
[01:02:46.643 --> 01:02:50.024]  I had to move into a place with a gate and stuff because of some of the security issues.
[01:02:51.784 --> 01:02:58.267]  And we're pulling up in this idyllic Leave it to Beaverton neighborhood, and there was just like old people and stuff out doing their yards.
[01:02:58.267 --> 01:03:00.629]  And he's like, ah, this neighborhood is so white.
[01:03:00.629 --> 01:03:01.569]  You think they're not going to like me?
[01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:03.010]  And I'm like, you got to be joking, man.
[01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:05.891]  It's all these Hispanics in the neighborhood, black people, you name it.
[01:03:05.891 --> 01:03:08.232]  But I'm telling you, it's a mind game.
[01:03:08.232 --> 01:03:17.157]  It's like when I was 12 and was invited by high schoolers to go to a party, and I felt insecure while folks were sitting around drinking beer.
[01:03:17.157 --> 01:03:20.979]  And then just as soon as I got into it and started dancing and having fun, it was great.
[01:03:21.994 --> 01:03:30.298]  And it's meant to make everybody uncomfortable, and they focus in on the black racist, they focus in on the white racist, to make us all think that's how it works, and that's just not it.
[01:03:30.298 --> 01:03:34.380]  It's such a powerful video.
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:36.161]  Up on InfoWars.com.
[01:03:36.161 --> 01:03:39.503]  This is what MSM is hiding at Trump rallies.
[01:03:39.503 --> 01:03:40.443]  It only has 81,000 views.
[01:03:43.134 --> 01:03:47.856]  Now, he's got other videos up there with a half million or more from this weekend, which is fine.
[01:03:47.856 --> 01:03:49.477]  This is the one that needs millions of views.
[01:03:49.477 --> 01:04:08.047]  In fact, I think I'm going to take it, do commentary on it, and then maybe put it back out, and then tie it into some of the other things that are happening, because it ends the mindlessness when we actually get together.
[01:04:09.329 --> 01:04:17.958]  And that's why they have the leaders of these groups come in, who are the controllers, they'll have the useful idiots with them, they'll link hands, and then they'll just ram them into people.
[01:04:17.958 --> 01:04:20.320]  Come on, let's get these races, let's stop them!
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.142]  Let's stand up!
[01:04:22.142 --> 01:04:25.266]  Then there's a melee, then once the news comes out...
[01:04:26.752 --> 01:04:28.653]  They claim the Trump people are attacking.
[01:04:28.653 --> 01:04:30.253]  This is how they try to shut down free speech.
[01:04:30.253 --> 01:04:33.915]  And the Washington Post was out yesterday saying, should Donald Trump be fined?
[01:04:33.915 --> 01:04:34.835]  Should he be arrested?
[01:04:34.835 --> 01:04:37.816]  Could he be sued because of what he's saying is causing this?
[01:04:37.816 --> 01:04:42.618]  So you have free speech, you say something, someone comes and attacks you, it's your fault.
[01:04:42.618 --> 01:04:44.699]  That's what they've already got in place in Europe.
[01:04:44.699 --> 01:04:48.320]  Now I'm going to come back and get into one of these operatives.
[01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:58.554]  Claiming that the Trump campaign manager ran into her, and you look at the video, he just brushed past her.
[01:04:58.554 --> 01:05:06.319]  Last week, we reported on one Pablo Serrano Vitorino, an illegal alien who has been charged with killing his neighbor and three other men with an AK-47.
[01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:12.884]  Now it has emerged that US immigration authorities had this man in custody twice last year and let him slip through their fingers.
[01:05:12.884 --> 01:05:15.145]  It also just came out that ICE revealed that a hundred
[01:05:15.846 --> 01:05:21.992]  124 illegal immigrants released from jail by the Obama administration since 2010 have subsequently been charged with murder.
[01:05:21.992 --> 01:05:32.664]  The report from the Center of Immigration Studies reads, the criminal aliens released by ICE in these years who had already been convicted of thousands of crimes are responsible for a significant crime spree in American communities, including 124 homicides.
[01:05:34.426 --> 01:05:38.527]  Inexplicably, ICE is choosing to release some criminal aliens multiple times.
[01:05:38.527 --> 01:05:43.269]  John Kasich in Thursday's CNN debate, who said he would enact his largest amnesty in U.S.
[01:05:43.269 --> 01:05:45.430]  history within his first hundred days in office.
[01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:53.252]  Here's a man barely hanging on to his political life, who wants to offer amnesty for people who came here illegally, and some of which have proven to be homicidal maniacs.
[01:05:53.252 --> 01:05:55.013]  Thank God we still have the Second Amendment.
[01:05:55.013 --> 01:05:57.754]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:05:59.941 --> 01:06:03.724]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:06:03.724 --> 01:06:11.449]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:06:11.449 --> 01:06:20.054]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:06:20.054 --> 01:06:24.497]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:06:24.497 --> 01:06:29.661]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:06:29.881 --> 01:06:30.921]  We're good to go.
[01:06:58.468 --> 01:07:00.511]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[01:07:00.511 --> 01:07:01.732]  Try a bottle of it.
[01:07:01.732 --> 01:07:03.314]  Rob Dew joins us.
[01:07:03.314 --> 01:07:06.418]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[01:07:06.418 --> 01:07:07.539]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[01:07:07.539 --> 01:07:08.480]  I've been working all day.
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.983]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:07:10.983 --> 01:07:12.405]  I get in here at 830.
[01:07:12.405 --> 01:07:14.307]  I was kind of run down.
[01:07:14.307 --> 01:07:16.029]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[01:07:16.209 --> 01:07:18.111]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:07:18.111 --> 01:07:19.933]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[01:07:19.933 --> 01:07:20.994]  I popped two of them.
[01:07:20.994 --> 01:07:23.276]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[01:07:23.276 --> 01:07:25.218]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[01:07:25.218 --> 01:07:26.719]  It's got four and a half stars.
[01:07:26.719 --> 01:07:28.060]  People really love it.
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:28.661]  Read about it.
[01:07:28.661 --> 01:07:32.505]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[01:07:32.505 --> 01:07:37.770]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:41.973]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[01:07:41.973 --> 01:07:48.137]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[01:07:48.137 --> 01:07:54.062]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:10.714]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:08:10.714 --> 01:08:12.274]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:08:12.274 --> 01:08:15.956]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:22.009 --> 01:08:24.131]  Welcome back to the second hour.
[01:08:24.131 --> 01:08:27.475]  The consummate Trump insider, Roger Stone, gives us weekly updates.
[01:08:27.475 --> 01:08:33.961]  He's gonna be popping in with huge breaking news on an upcoming sex scandal and Ted Cruz and a lot more.
[01:08:33.961 --> 01:08:36.864]  Also, it's Hillary and the Soros group funding
[01:08:37.725 --> 01:08:42.846]  The Black Lives Matter attacks in Chicago and other areas to frame Sanders.
[01:08:42.846 --> 01:08:45.567]  And of course the supporters are so stupid they don't even know that.
[01:08:45.567 --> 01:08:47.427]  They're getting funding from the same place.
[01:08:47.427 --> 01:08:48.808]  That's coming up.
[01:08:48.808 --> 01:08:52.749]  We'll also take calls in the third hour today.
[01:08:52.749 --> 01:08:59.310]  Matt Dubiel, who you can see on screen if you're watching TV, will be joining us here in just a few minutes.
[01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:02.671]  But recapping and getting into some of the Trump news I haven't covered.
[01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:06.532]  CNN gives airtime to a guy who admitted he wanted to murder Trump.
[01:09:08.322 --> 01:09:14.907]  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders accused Donald Trump of inciting violence, even as the Soros-funded group takes credit.
[01:09:14.907 --> 01:09:17.069]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:20.611]  And I want to cover this with Matt after we talk about Chicago.
[01:09:20.611 --> 01:09:23.173]  Must-see new video, InfoWars.com.
[01:09:23.173 --> 01:09:29.578]  Did Michelle Fields file false charges against Trump campaign manager?
[01:09:29.578 --> 01:09:31.860]  And people heard about this the last weekend.
[01:09:32.751 --> 01:09:33.831]  Huge news!
[01:09:33.831 --> 01:09:46.354]  You know, not only does Trump hate black people and Hispanics and keep children in, you know, basements and eat them like the Wicked Witch in Hansel and Gretel, he also has his campaign manager beat up women.
[01:09:46.354 --> 01:09:55.696]  And the savior, though, is Megyn Kelly and Fox News that says they're not going to go with basically Democrats now.
[01:09:55.696 --> 01:09:56.856]  Isn't that sweet of them?
[01:09:56.856 --> 01:10:01.477]  They're in so much trouble now they can't even pose like they're conservative or patriots.
[01:10:01.477 --> 01:10:02.117]  Well, now
[01:10:03.663 --> 01:10:05.024]  We have the footage slowed down.
[01:10:05.024 --> 01:10:05.584]  We're going to play it.
[01:10:05.584 --> 01:10:07.486]  We're going to describe it for radio listeners.
[01:10:07.486 --> 01:10:09.107]  This is the incident she's talking about.
[01:10:09.107 --> 01:10:11.149]  She didn't know it got caught on tape.
[01:10:11.149 --> 01:10:14.031]  He's following Donald Trump to the crowd of reporters.
[01:10:14.031 --> 01:10:17.473]  He brushes past her.
[01:10:17.473 --> 01:10:18.354]  She smiles.
[01:10:18.354 --> 01:10:19.635]  That says nothing.
[01:10:19.635 --> 01:10:23.078]  And this is him brutally throwing her to the ground.
[01:10:23.078 --> 01:10:27.481]  And I'm telling you folks, I have dealt with this.
[01:10:27.481 --> 01:10:28.201]  I have dealt with it.
[01:10:31.707 --> 01:10:33.368]  It was in a court case.
[01:10:33.368 --> 01:10:34.529]  It's sealed.
[01:10:34.529 --> 01:10:35.250]  I can't get into it.
[01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:43.737]  It's the type of stuff we deal with behind the scenes where it was brought up in court that I assaulted the communist.
[01:10:43.737 --> 01:10:46.098]  The live stream went out that day.
[01:10:46.098 --> 01:10:46.759]  I was there.
[01:10:46.759 --> 01:10:47.279]  I did nothing.
[01:10:47.279 --> 01:10:48.140]  They linked hands.
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:48.921]  They ran into us.
[01:10:51.437 --> 01:10:53.399]  And this is what they do.
[01:10:53.399 --> 01:10:59.245]  And when they do this to cops in other areas, the cops get in trouble and the feds come in and arrest them.
[01:10:59.245 --> 01:11:03.309]  And I'm not defending the cops here in every case, but compared to these people, give me a break.
[01:11:03.309 --> 01:11:04.089]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:11:04.089 --> 01:11:05.671]  In fact, back it up 20 seconds.
[01:11:05.671 --> 01:11:07.913]  Matt's been with us the bottom of the hour, but this all fits together.
[01:11:07.913 --> 01:11:11.757]  Back it up with audio for radio listeners, but for TV viewers, you can obviously see it.
[01:11:11.757 --> 01:11:13.478]  For radio listeners, they did this four or five times.
[01:11:14.264 --> 01:11:15.625]  They would link hands.
[01:11:15.625 --> 01:11:18.866]  We're just out there at an abortion clinic on the side of the street doing nothing.
[01:11:18.866 --> 01:11:26.070]  They would link hands and then just run into us and actually knock people over.
[01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:32.353]  And then, and then, and then I'm in court and I'm literally being shown this asking why I assaulted them.
[01:11:32.353 --> 01:11:35.234]  I mean, this is, this country is upside down.
[01:11:35.234 --> 01:11:37.495]  Let's back it up.
[01:11:37.495 --> 01:11:38.195]  Let's back it up.
[01:11:38.195 --> 01:11:43.298]  Let's back it up 30 seconds so you can see them come run into us and then it
[01:11:45.731 --> 01:11:47.012]  I've never heard this happen before.
[01:11:47.012 --> 01:11:47.512]  It's really weird.
[01:11:47.512 --> 01:11:49.252]  I just got a feed of myself 20 seconds ago through my ears.
[01:11:49.252 --> 01:11:53.474]  Alright, well, we're going to try it one more time because I want TV viewers and everybody to see this as they link arms and run into us.
[01:11:53.474 --> 01:11:55.375]  Let's back it up and see this one more time.
[01:11:55.375 --> 01:11:55.695]  Here it is.
[01:12:10.035 --> 01:12:12.160]  Yeah, I think that we're going to continue forward as a country.
[01:12:21.469 --> 01:12:35.492]  Now I'm going to loop that again for folks from the beginning where they link arms and run into us.
[01:12:35.492 --> 01:12:48.775]  This is what they do, and then from Chicago to places in Ohio to Austin, Texas, when they run into you, then they come after you to the police.
[01:12:52.330 --> 01:13:04.088]  We're just out there standing on the grass, on government right-of-ways, on public property, being peaceful, talking to folks, and we get attacked.
[01:13:04.088 --> 01:13:04.889]  Now I want to go to Matt.
[01:13:06.161 --> 01:13:11.804]  Dubiel is the Vice President and General Manager of WCKG Radio in Chicago.
[01:13:11.804 --> 01:13:19.869]  And of course, he's made national headlines when they had his three-year-old son going through the TSA scrutiny.
[01:13:19.869 --> 01:13:21.270]  That made some people angry.
[01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:24.392]  WCKG carries our broadcast several hours a day.
[01:13:24.392 --> 01:13:26.613]  We've been on for four or five years.
[01:13:26.613 --> 01:13:31.516]  1530 WCKG.com, 1530 WCKG.com.
[01:13:31.516 --> 01:13:34.017]  Folks all over Chicago can listen to this fine station.
[01:13:34.017 --> 01:13:35.138]  So even if you don't live in Chicago,
[01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:41.642]  Call your friends, your family, your neighbors, folks you know, former co-workers and tell them tune in today to find the truth.
[01:13:41.642 --> 01:13:45.925]  And you can also subscribe to the channel and get their podcast and more.
[01:13:45.925 --> 01:13:56.371]  So Matt, we've set the table here with just an example of the type of stuff that's going on where they literally think they're allowed to climb up on stage and try to attack Donald Trump.
[01:13:56.371 --> 01:13:57.472]  They're allowed to attack us.
[01:13:57.472 --> 01:14:01.735]  They're allowed to knock a guy over, you know, in front of us on crutches that can hardly walk.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:11.592]  They target people in wheelchairs, and then they say, it's our First Amendment's fault, and the Washington Post says, can Trump be held responsible?
[01:14:11.592 --> 01:14:13.735]  You've got a lot of videos on your Facebook page.
[01:14:13.735 --> 01:14:17.901]  We're going to put that up in a moment and play some of those, but you were there last week.
[01:14:17.901 --> 01:14:19.063]  What really happened in Chicago?
[01:14:20.375 --> 01:14:24.559]  It's interesting because what we're hearing about isn't what was going on there.
[01:14:24.559 --> 01:14:29.323]  First off, this place was heavily protected by police to begin with.
[01:14:29.323 --> 01:14:31.865]  And what I saw were Americans there.
[01:14:31.865 --> 01:14:33.346]  These Trump supporters that were there.
[01:14:33.346 --> 01:14:35.408]  I didn't go to, by the way, I didn't go to support Trump.
[01:14:35.408 --> 01:14:36.889]  I went there to cover this event.
[01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:37.750]  I went with my wife.
[01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:38.991]  We were in the press pit.
[01:14:38.991 --> 01:14:42.013]  But there's two interesting things you need to know that you're not hearing.
[01:14:42.013 --> 01:14:48.919]  Number one is about the press pit and what the press pit says about the people at the event that they don't even know about.
[01:14:49.019 --> 01:14:53.481]  What they're saying about Americans in the press pit would blow your mind, and I'll share that with you.
[01:14:53.481 --> 01:14:57.263]  But when we looked around, what we saw was veterans.
[01:14:57.263 --> 01:15:07.087]  There were people in wheelchairs, there were... And you're looking at some of my footage before the melee happened, and you see just a cross-section of middle America.
[01:15:07.087 --> 01:15:12.129]  And you see guys with their kids and families and little kids.
[01:15:12.129 --> 01:15:17.572]  In fact, we almost brought my sons with, and thank God that we didn't, because when things turned,
[01:15:18.312 --> 01:15:46.477]  I was panicked in here because you know and you've been in these situations before where when something flips and it becomes a tinderbox and you know you got to get out of there and I'm sure that some people think that I sound like the biggest pansy of all time and if I were by myself there I probably would have felt less concerned but I had my wife there the mother of my children and we almost brought our kids and all I'm thinking about is there's people here with their children
[01:15:47.037 --> 01:15:48.618]  And this is the environment it was.
[01:15:48.618 --> 01:15:54.061]  By the way, you just showed a clip of a man, a white guy and a black guy swing at each other.
[01:15:54.061 --> 01:15:57.143]  The white guy there was a Trump supporter.
[01:15:57.143 --> 01:15:58.383]  He was a little unruly.
[01:15:58.383 --> 01:16:01.145]  He was out of his mind there.
[01:16:01.145 --> 01:16:06.608]  The black gentleman there is the man that was on the stage that took over for Trump's
[01:16:07.348 --> 01:16:12.869]  He took over the stage, and he was interviewed in the news afterwards, and they talked about how he was peaceful.
[01:16:12.869 --> 01:16:19.211]  And then, as they were summarizing how he was so peaceful, they showed the footage of him and another guy swinging at each other.
[01:16:19.211 --> 01:16:20.371]  That's not peaceful!
[01:16:20.371 --> 01:16:21.612]  That's not okay!
[01:16:21.612 --> 01:16:23.432]  Both sides shouldn't be doing that.
[01:16:23.432 --> 01:16:26.733]  And this is what they're not really talking about at that event.
[01:16:26.733 --> 01:16:30.994]  It was a peaceful event until the moment when they announced that
[01:16:31.494 --> 01:16:35.057]  It was cancelled or postponed for safety concerns.
[01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:40.782]  And then you saw all the people that were in the crowd that were virtually sleeper cells.
[01:16:40.782 --> 01:16:42.884]  And I don't want to use that term because I know that they were too.
[01:16:42.884 --> 01:16:43.524]  No, that's what it is.
[01:16:43.524 --> 01:16:44.845]  They're hired by George Soros.
[01:16:44.845 --> 01:16:46.187]  He's taking credit.
[01:16:46.187 --> 01:16:46.967]  Hillary.
[01:16:46.967 --> 01:16:48.288]  And they're blaming Sanders.
[01:16:48.288 --> 01:16:48.889]  It's incredible.
[01:16:48.889 --> 01:16:49.850]  They paid him to do it.
[01:16:50.310 --> 01:17:08.631]  They're under orders, they're mercenaries, and they go in and they do this, and as soon as they know that happened, okay, now we're not going to disrupt Trump, now we're going to activate because our threats worked to shut it down, and now we're going to cause a melee so they can run headlines saying the most dangerous place to be in the world is a Trump rally for a chilling effect.
[01:17:09.292 --> 01:17:10.554]  It was, it was unbelievable.
[01:17:10.554 --> 01:17:16.222]  So the minute they announced, we go from this event, which by the way, I took footage and it wasn't filled yet.
[01:17:16.222 --> 01:17:22.210]  And the reason why it wasn't filled was because everybody that's coming through, they have to, you know, wand you, they have the secret service at the front.
[01:17:22.210 --> 01:17:23.411]  We went through the press gates.
[01:17:23.411 --> 01:17:25.955]  So it was a little bit of a fast track, obviously.
[01:17:26.495 --> 01:17:31.979]  Uh, but they're, they're testing and they're checking everyone for explosives or, you know, weapons, whatever.
[01:17:31.979 --> 01:17:35.981]  And so this room is not filling up as fast as I expected.
[01:17:35.981 --> 01:17:37.162]  And I took footage of that.
[01:17:37.162 --> 01:17:39.643]  So it was, it was very vacant in the beginning.
[01:17:39.643 --> 01:17:41.024]  It filled up and filled up.
[01:17:41.024 --> 01:17:47.989]  And then we started looking around and I noticed firsthand that these people are, that are in the front pit area that are close to the stage.
[01:17:48.823 --> 01:17:57.867]  And I'm looking at myself and I'm looking at my wife and I'm saying to myself, you know, these people don't seem like your typical Trump supporters.
[01:17:57.867 --> 01:18:01.429]  They were under 30.
[01:18:01.429 --> 01:18:06.931]  A lot of them looked like they might have been Middle Eastern or college students.
[01:18:06.931 --> 01:18:08.592]  It's not what you typically see.
[01:18:08.592 --> 01:18:10.633]  And so, as a white guy, I go like, well,
[01:18:10.993 --> 01:18:11.793]  Check yourself.
[01:18:11.793 --> 01:18:13.594]  It's not only white people that support Trump.
[01:18:13.594 --> 01:18:14.974]  Let's see what happens.
[01:18:14.974 --> 01:18:23.037]  Sure enough, when they made that announcement, those were the people that erupted and began turning that event upside down.
[01:18:23.037 --> 01:18:32.281]  Later, come to find out that this group SEIU, which is some union group organization funded with some taxpayer money in Chicago, had a rally beforehand.
[01:18:32.281 --> 01:18:33.961]  They partnered with Black Lives Matter.
[01:18:33.961 --> 01:18:35.322]  They partnered with MoveOn.org.
[01:18:35.882 --> 01:18:48.714]  Kurt Nemo had an article on Friday about this, I forget the headline, but it was a Kurt Nemo story about what, I think it was, what they're not telling you about Chicago, I think was the headline, and it shows the people wearing the t-shirts saying, you know, Muslims against Trump.
[01:18:48.714 --> 01:18:52.137]  And there's video where these people are running into people.
[01:18:52.137 --> 01:18:54.159]  So, again, this is what the left does.
[01:18:54.159 --> 01:18:58.603]  They run into you, they try to knock you over, they seem to target handicapped folks,
[01:18:59.264 --> 01:19:04.488]  I guess because they're such cowards, I guess they're getting paid to attack people so they want to attack an old lady or somebody in a wheelchair.
[01:19:04.488 --> 01:19:07.911]  Let me tell you, I see somebody attacking somebody in a wheelchair, we're going to stand up against you.
[01:19:07.911 --> 01:19:09.632]  And we did push the communists back.
[01:19:09.632 --> 01:19:10.953]  We did stand up for ourselves.
[01:19:10.953 --> 01:19:13.175]  And in America, that's illegal.
[01:19:13.175 --> 01:19:15.037]  You're supposed to let them attack you, Matt.
[01:19:15.777 --> 01:19:22.943]  What people have to understand about freedom of speech is it doesn't give you freedom from consequences, number one.
[01:19:22.943 --> 01:19:27.707]  And number two, you can't go to a private event and shout free speech.
[01:19:27.707 --> 01:19:29.008]  You want to have free speech?
[01:19:29.008 --> 01:19:30.749]  You want to have an event like Donald's?
[01:19:30.749 --> 01:19:31.770]  Hold your own event.
[01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:33.791]  You want to reach an audience like Alex's?
[01:19:33.791 --> 01:19:35.012]  Start your own network.
[01:19:35.012 --> 01:19:36.253]  You want to reach people?
[01:19:36.253 --> 01:19:37.334]  Do it on your Twitter feed.
[01:19:37.334 --> 01:19:39.756]  But you do not have... It's perfect socialism.
[01:19:39.756 --> 01:19:41.838]  It's rule by conquest.
[01:19:41.838 --> 01:19:43.079]  We're just going to take your event over.
[01:19:43.499 --> 01:19:47.300]  We're just going to take over government and vote ourselves bigger welfare checks.
[01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:49.800]  And again, it's the multinational banks.
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:50.921]  They've dominated the country.
[01:19:50.921 --> 01:19:52.521]  They're the real welfare queens.
[01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:58.302]  So they're creating a substrata of dependent people who will erupt any time they don't get their freebies.
[01:19:58.302 --> 01:20:00.443]  What do you overall think of the Trump phenomenon?
[01:20:00.443 --> 01:20:02.624]  Tell me the truth, because I don't even know your views on this.
[01:20:02.624 --> 01:20:03.784]  I know you're a libertarian.
[01:20:03.784 --> 01:20:06.124]  Where do you see all this going?
[01:20:06.124 --> 01:20:08.685]  What do you think about all the other big political issues that are unfolding?
[01:20:09.522 --> 01:20:13.764]  I left that event, Alex, and I was freaked out.
[01:20:13.764 --> 01:20:16.205]  I went there with my wife.
[01:20:16.205 --> 01:20:18.126]  We got a babysitter for the kids.
[01:20:18.126 --> 01:20:21.228]  I left there and I thought, oh man, we're in trouble.
[01:20:21.228 --> 01:20:22.768]  This country is in trouble.
[01:20:22.768 --> 01:20:26.070]  And it's not Trump's fault, and it's not Bernie's fault.
[01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:31.793]  It's eight years of this president that we had, and by the way, it's eight years of the president before him.
[01:20:32.373 --> 01:20:37.438]  It's just a shift here in the United States that have put us in a bad situation.
[01:20:37.438 --> 01:20:41.162]  I gotta tell you, I'm not necessarily for Trump.
[01:20:41.162 --> 01:20:43.444]  I'm not necessarily against Trump.
[01:20:43.444 --> 01:20:46.327]  But I will say, the media in the media pit
[01:20:47.228 --> 01:20:49.309]  They were making fun of the attendees.
[01:20:49.309 --> 01:20:51.489]  This is what people need to realize, okay?
[01:20:51.489 --> 01:20:54.110]  Those aren't Trump supporters in that building.
[01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:56.070]  Those are American men and women.
[01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:57.511]  Some of those are veterans.
[01:20:57.511 --> 01:20:58.951]  Some of those are children.
[01:20:58.951 --> 01:21:05.372]  Those are American men and women who deserve the opportunity to vote, to voice their choice.
[01:21:05.372 --> 01:21:09.413]  And by the way, so do the protesters the right way.
[01:21:09.413 --> 01:21:15.735]  And when we want to silence the other side, you know, freedom of speech shouldn't be mutually exclusive.
[01:21:16.315 --> 01:21:17.716]  I want to hear everyone talk.
[01:21:17.716 --> 01:21:18.797]  That's what I was about to say.
[01:21:18.797 --> 01:21:31.169]  Can you imagine when Obama was getting crowds not as big but close in 2007-2008, if predominantly, you know, 200-300 white people started showing up and then running into folks?
[01:21:31.169 --> 01:21:34.972]  It would be just all over the news, the end of the world.
[01:21:34.972 --> 01:21:38.435]  But because it's being done to somebody who's been branded as a white guy,
[01:21:39.316 --> 01:21:39.957]  It's allowed.
[01:21:39.957 --> 01:21:53.090]  And again, it's meant to scare people away, period, from rallies, to scare them away from Trump, but to scare, quote, minorities away from the Tea Party, from conservatism, from libertarian thought.
[01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:56.094]  I mean, it is just truly, truly sickening.
[01:21:56.094 --> 01:21:57.795]  And being in the press all these years,
[01:21:58.616 --> 01:22:06.999]  I've seen the disdain, nine out of ten people in the media, in newspapers, even in radio, TV, you name it, because you don't get jobs if you're not.
[01:22:06.999 --> 01:22:15.761]  Even though conservatism and libertarianism gets good ratings, the listenership's conservative, all over the country they got big money coming in to kick libertarians and patriots off the air.
[01:22:15.761 --> 01:22:17.142]  I mean, it's serious.
[01:22:17.142 --> 01:22:20.183]  Big money comes in and says, you put these shows on, we'll advertise.
[01:22:20.183 --> 01:22:22.504]  It's sick, because they want to stop the message.
[01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:26.425]  But you get in these pits, and the disdain and the arrogance of the media
[01:22:27.341 --> 01:22:30.647]  The hatred of what I'd call bitter clingers.
[01:22:30.647 --> 01:22:31.648]  It really is sick.
[01:22:31.648 --> 01:22:32.530]  It's a cult.
[01:22:32.530 --> 01:22:39.741]  So describe to us, in the pit, with the types of press that were there, what type of comments you heard about the Trump supporters.
[01:22:41.302 --> 01:22:42.482]  It made me sad.
[01:22:42.482 --> 01:22:43.703]  It really did.
[01:22:43.703 --> 01:22:57.046]  And as I think about it now, I get really upset because the way they were talking, you could hear them, because you're in this tight, you're in this little cage, it's like you're in a chicken coop together, and there's cameras and there's microphones, they're all in there.
[01:22:57.046 --> 01:23:02.288]  And these people are, not all of them by the way, there's some people in there that, especially the old school journalists,
[01:23:02.928 --> 01:23:03.209]  I don't
[01:23:17.605 --> 01:23:20.346]  My wife and I stood there in the pit and there was a Secret Service agent there.
[01:23:20.346 --> 01:23:21.606]  We talked with him for a little bit.
[01:23:21.606 --> 01:23:22.607]  Amazing guy.
[01:23:22.607 --> 01:23:24.167]  He didn't do that.
[01:23:24.167 --> 01:23:31.309]  He didn't opine about, oh, Trump supporters are dumb or they're low information or they're this or they're that.
[01:23:31.309 --> 01:23:34.450]  He looks at it as, hey, listen, sometimes I'm on the Trump detail.
[01:23:34.450 --> 01:23:36.911]  Sometimes I'm on the Bernie detail.
[01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:39.252]  All the time, I'm a Secret Service guy.
[01:23:39.252 --> 01:23:40.152]  I'm wearing this pin.
[01:23:40.152 --> 01:23:41.852]  I represent my country.
[01:23:41.852 --> 01:23:43.673]  And this is the political process.
[01:23:44.233 --> 01:23:52.775]  I want this to be the political process, without the violence, without the shenanigans, but I want people to support Bernie and Hillary.
[01:23:52.775 --> 01:23:54.995]  That's what this is all about.
[01:23:54.995 --> 01:24:10.399]  And when we start getting to a point... You mean it's their right to do it, I hope you don't want them to be supporting... Matt, expanding on that, again, 1530, they're in Chicago, folks, WCKG, looking at this, were the comments just snarky or were they hateful?
[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.944]  Uh, you know, that hate, that hate term is a dangerous term.
[01:24:14.944 --> 01:24:16.927]  They like to throw that around a lot these days.
[01:24:16.927 --> 01:24:17.969]  Okay, well how would you describe them?
[01:24:17.969 --> 01:24:19.111]  I mean, what type of stuff were they saying?
[01:24:20.235 --> 01:24:24.118]  They don't see people for people.
[01:24:24.118 --> 01:24:29.763]  They were talking about the people like, they put them in a group just like people are doing with conservatives and liberals.
[01:24:29.763 --> 01:24:31.284]  And this is why I hate these labels.
[01:24:31.284 --> 01:24:34.047]  This is why I'm not a Republican and I'm not a Democrat.
[01:24:34.047 --> 01:24:42.874]  This is why I refuse to put one of those labels on myself because when you do that, you allow everyone else to define you based on their frame of what that is.
[01:24:43.294 --> 01:24:44.355]  What is a Trump fan?
[01:24:44.355 --> 01:24:46.736]  What is a Trump protester?
[01:24:46.736 --> 01:24:51.398]  Sure, I have friends that are mad at me because I don't support Ted Cruz over Trump.
[01:24:51.398 --> 01:24:55.460]  I mean, I'm sorry, Ted Cruz does have the Bushes running his campaign now.
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:59.401]  Ted Cruz came out and said it's Trump's fault there's violence, when clearly that's not true.
[01:24:59.401 --> 01:25:01.983]  He lost a lot of police group support.
[01:25:01.983 --> 01:25:05.184]  He's got all these CFR connections, TPP connections.
[01:25:05.184 --> 01:25:06.785]  I like the guy a lot better than Hillary.
[01:25:06.785 --> 01:25:09.486]  I like his voting record in the Senate on a lot of things.
[01:25:09.486 --> 01:25:10.907]  I don't dislike him as a person.
[01:25:11.887 --> 01:25:15.929]  But clearly the Republican establishment doesn't want Donald Trump.
[01:25:15.929 --> 01:25:18.910]  What do you think that says about Trump, this Trump phenomenon?
[01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:22.972]  I mean, Matt, tell us at your gut level, what do you think about Trump?
[01:25:22.972 --> 01:25:29.235]  I think that all the things that people like about him are all the things that could make him scary later.
[01:25:29.235 --> 01:25:30.676]  And I understand that.
[01:25:30.676 --> 01:25:39.240]  I think that all the things that he's speaking about... Look, you have to show everyone what the problem is if you want to say that there needs to be a solution.
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:47.065]  So here's a guy who's out there saying, we got some problems, we gotta go after them, the old way doesn't work, and let's get to it.
[01:25:47.065 --> 01:25:51.847]  And so now, the message gets attacked through that messenger, which is Donald Trump.
[01:25:51.847 --> 01:26:01.793]  If people don't like him, if people are going to all this trouble to thwart him, and then say it's because he's a racist, those are the tactics that, you know, they'll say, oh, he's Hitler.
[01:26:01.793 --> 01:26:03.314]  That's what Hitler would have done.
[01:26:03.314 --> 01:26:05.296]  Hitler would have said, Donald Trump is Hitler.
[01:26:05.296 --> 01:26:08.558]  Goebbels would have said- Well that's my point, is a man on a white horse is scary.
[01:26:09.398 --> 01:26:16.519]  But the elite itself is a oligarchy, a shapeless, formless group of bureaucrats and special interests.
[01:26:16.519 --> 01:26:23.120]  The fact that that monstrosity is scared of him really makes me want to support Trump.
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:26.781]  I mean, I agree with so much of what he stands for, so much of what he does.
[01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:30.622]  And at the same time, he says some things I disagree with as well.
[01:26:30.622 --> 01:26:34.902]  That's why I think it's important for patriots to be involved to keep Trump honest.
[01:26:34.902 --> 01:26:36.863]  Because look at the alternatives.
[01:26:36.863 --> 01:26:37.803]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:26:39.082 --> 01:26:40.624]  What else is on your radar screen?
[01:26:40.624 --> 01:26:41.805]  What else is concerning you?
[01:26:41.805 --> 01:26:48.133]  I saw an article that the murder rate had doubled in the last year in Chicago.
[01:26:48.133 --> 01:26:52.818]  I thought it had been going down some, but then I saw that headline in the Chicago Tribune.
[01:26:52.818 --> 01:26:54.901]  What is going on there?
[01:26:54.901 --> 01:26:58.065]  And where do you see this country going?
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:11.189]  I'll get some trolls and some snarky comments for this, but at this rate, number one, you've got to realize that while that event on Friday night was embarrassing, I was embarrassed to be in Chicago.
[01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:15.372]  I was embarrassed to be an American because of everyone's behavior there.
[01:27:15.372 --> 01:27:17.955]  That said, it doesn't really represent Chicago.
[01:27:18.695 --> 01:27:21.938]  However, Chicago has a lot of problems.
[01:27:21.938 --> 01:27:23.960]  The schools have problems.
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:25.341]  The murder rate has problems.
[01:27:25.341 --> 01:27:29.144]  You know, outside of Chicago, the suburbs, we live in a bubble here.
[01:27:29.144 --> 01:27:30.345]  The suburbs are very nice.
[01:27:30.345 --> 01:27:32.307]  They're very well taken care of.
[01:27:32.307 --> 01:27:37.452]  But Chicago is on the road to becoming Detroit if something doesn't change fast.
[01:27:37.452 --> 01:27:40.575]  People in Chicago are fed up with the way that things are going in Chicago.
[01:27:41.215 --> 01:27:41.995]  That's the bottom line.
[01:27:41.995 --> 01:27:43.076]  And the government's arrogant.
[01:27:43.076 --> 01:27:48.679]  It's a microcosm of California, which is a microcosm of the country, that is a microcosm of the whole world.
[01:27:48.679 --> 01:27:58.645]  The elites just see red carpets and caviar and, you know, hookers, and they're robbing everybody, and they don't understand that if the mega banks steal everything, there'll be nowhere to spend the money they've stolen.
[01:28:00.436 --> 01:28:15.457]  If the Democratic machine didn't fix Chicago for the last 50 years, if eight years of hope and change and yes we can didn't change the country, and eight years before that George W. Bush didn't fix the country,
[01:28:15.757 --> 01:28:18.878]  I think it's time to start going, okay, what's different?
[01:28:18.878 --> 01:28:20.219]  How can we do something different?
[01:28:20.219 --> 01:28:24.541]  And I think that's why everyone thinks that people are so angry.
[01:28:24.541 --> 01:28:27.582]  There's passion, and without passion, nothing's going to change.
[01:28:27.582 --> 01:28:33.084]  I mean, people that are in this country, that founded this country, got pretty passionate in the beginning.
[01:28:33.084 --> 01:28:38.326]  And without that passion, non-violent passion, by the way, we're in deep trouble.
[01:28:38.326 --> 01:28:41.808]  I think that now is a critical juncture for us in this country.
[01:28:41.988 --> 01:28:43.729]  Look, look, the left is not the left.
[01:28:43.729 --> 01:28:50.574]  They're a group of control freak bullies and big city Chicago-type mafia writ large across the nation.
[01:28:50.574 --> 01:28:52.816]  They want to intimidate and shut down our speech.
[01:28:52.816 --> 01:28:58.240]  And the answer is, even if you don't support Trump, everybody should go to the Trump rallies as an observer.
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:28:58.940]  I'm
[01:29:18.030 --> 01:29:20.790]  Reaching out to them saying, hey, we're true populists.
[01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:21.571]  Join us.
[01:29:21.571 --> 01:29:25.471]  Matt Dubiel, 1530 WCKG.com.
[01:29:25.471 --> 01:29:27.072]  You're a great host in your own right.
[01:29:27.072 --> 01:29:28.732]  I'm glad you text messaged me this morning.
[01:29:28.732 --> 01:29:30.192]  I'm so glad.
[01:29:30.192 --> 01:29:33.893]  Anytime you've got something big, brother, we'd like you to be our reporter in Chicago.
[01:29:33.893 --> 01:29:35.273]  I'd love to get you on all the time.
[01:29:35.273 --> 01:29:36.553]  Thank you so much.
[01:29:36.553 --> 01:29:37.293]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:29:37.293 --> 01:29:37.933]  Happy Easter.
[01:29:37.933 --> 01:29:38.574]  Thank you, brother.
[01:29:38.574 --> 01:29:39.054]  You too.
[01:29:39.054 --> 01:29:40.874]  Say hi to your great family, your wife and kids for me.
[01:29:40.874 --> 01:29:46.015]  We're going to come back with big North Korea news, economy news, health news and more.
[01:29:46.015 --> 01:29:46.615]  And your call.
[01:29:46.615 --> 01:29:47.035]  Stay with us.
[01:29:47.864 --> 01:29:50.873]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:50.873 --> 01:29:54.483]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.584 --> 01:30:13.034]  Action hero Jean-Claude Van Damme told a French television political show that the Rothschild and Rockefeller families will not let Donald Trump win the presidency because he is an anti-globalist candidate.
[01:30:13.034 --> 01:30:20.018]  Appearing on the Le Grand Journal, Van Damme said he was aware of who is really shaping U.S.
[01:30:20.018 --> 01:30:21.259]  presidential elections.
[01:30:21.539 --> 01:30:34.522]  Some of the other participants in the debate looked stunned as Van Damme continued to say that the Rothschilds rose to power in 1827 and they now control and dominate entire continents.
[01:30:34.522 --> 01:30:38.383]  And he says Donald Trump is not going to win the election.
[01:30:38.383 --> 01:30:47.926]  He went on to make a distinction between lobbyists that control the other candidates and people like Donald Trump who is truly anti-establishment.

[01:31:59.772 --> 01:32:01.713]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:32:01.713 --> 01:32:03.435]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:32:03.435 --> 01:32:07.477]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:32:07.477 --> 01:32:10.079]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:32:10.079 --> 01:32:12.501]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:32:12.501 --> 01:32:20.366]  Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:32:20.686 --> 01:32:23.910]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:25.452]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:32:25.452 --> 01:32:28.395]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:32:28.395 --> 01:32:30.157]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:32:30.157 --> 01:32:35.503]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[01:32:35.623 --> 01:32:36.283]  We're good to go.
[01:33:08.976 --> 01:33:14.659]  He aligns himself with the truth, but it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:14.659 --> 01:33:19.321]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.321 --> 01:33:23.302]  Look at these headlines.
[01:33:23.302 --> 01:33:28.985]  North Korea claims it could wipe out Manhattan with a hydrogen bomb.
[01:33:28.985 --> 01:33:33.047]  Just last week, they threatened to nuke the capital city of Seoul, South Korea.
[01:33:37.318 --> 01:33:40.721]  Here's the headline, Infowars.com.
[01:33:40.721 --> 01:33:43.303]  Nuclear war with North Korea coming?
[01:33:43.303 --> 01:33:47.146]  Question mark.
[01:33:47.146 --> 01:34:00.556]  Russia just last week threatened a preemptive invasion and nuclear attack on North Korea if they don't stop threatening to launch preemptive nuclear strikes.
[01:34:00.556 --> 01:34:03.619]  Now I said this at the very beginning of the broadcast today.
[01:34:05.137 --> 01:34:14.985]  And I don't know what it is, but it always is bore out that my six cents for the months leading up to 9-11 was off the charts.
[01:34:14.985 --> 01:34:17.567]  And I said they'll probably blow up the World Trade Centers and blame it on Bin Laden.
[01:34:17.567 --> 01:34:21.230]  If you don't believe me, just go to YouTube and type it in.
[01:34:21.230 --> 01:34:22.631]  It's up there.
[01:34:22.631 --> 01:34:24.253]  There's a whole two-hour show where I did it.
[01:34:24.253 --> 01:34:24.793]  I'm not bragging.
[01:34:24.793 --> 01:34:28.116]  I can see all the pre-programming, all the propaganda.
[01:34:28.116 --> 01:34:28.776]  It was very clear.
[01:34:28.776 --> 01:34:30.418]  They're like, here's Bin Laden.
[01:34:30.418 --> 01:34:31.218]  He's going to get you.
[01:34:31.218 --> 01:34:32.640]  When he attacks, give up all your rights.
[01:34:33.735 --> 01:34:37.037]  I know the World Trade Centers had asbestos.
[01:34:37.037 --> 01:34:38.338]  One of them was leaning.
[01:34:38.338 --> 01:34:39.279]  They were going to tear it down.
[01:34:39.279 --> 01:34:40.860]  I said, no, that was the globalists.
[01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:46.885]  The globalists already cooked the bomb, trained the driver, already hit it in 1992, 93.
[01:34:46.885 --> 01:34:48.966]  That was 93.
[01:34:48.966 --> 01:34:51.628]  And so, right as Bush was leaving office.
[01:34:51.628 --> 01:34:54.470]  And so, they'll probably hit it again, and they'll probably blame it on him.
[01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:55.811]  And I could just see it all.
[01:34:55.811 --> 01:34:56.512]  I could feel it.
[01:34:56.512 --> 01:34:58.213]  It happened.
[01:34:58.213 --> 01:35:00.395]  Unless you believe I said it, and they went, oh, that's a great idea.
[01:35:00.395 --> 01:35:00.795]  Let's do it.
[01:35:02.585 --> 01:35:03.646]  It's one thing to say on the day.
[01:35:03.646 --> 01:35:04.406]  I said it before.
[01:35:04.406 --> 01:35:06.828]  I'm not bragging.
[01:35:06.828 --> 01:35:11.491]  I got up on the morning Scalia died, and I called Anthony, I called Dew, I called Buckley, and I said, I want you to come into the office.
[01:35:11.491 --> 01:35:13.813]  We were here about seven, eight hours.
[01:35:13.813 --> 01:35:18.196]  Well, I was walking around the table sweating, saying big stuff's about to happen.
[01:35:18.196 --> 01:35:21.418]  And the Scalia death is a sign of a chain reaction.
[01:35:21.418 --> 01:35:24.560]  I wasn't freaking out at a gut level over that.
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:31.225]  I was picking up the movement and the threat to the rest of the government that was legitimate, that this really means we're going into a new level of tyranny.
[01:35:33.598 --> 01:35:40.263]  Now, this has been going on all morning, and some people in the office say, hey, just ignore it, you know, don't feed the trolls.
[01:35:40.263 --> 01:35:41.283]  No, no.
[01:35:41.283 --> 01:35:42.644]  It's not about feeding the trolls.
[01:35:42.644 --> 01:36:02.237]  It's about documenting attacks on free speech where they say they want to arrest in the Washington Post or fine or sue Donald Trump because he's making George Soros and Hillary fund groups that come in and run over people in wheelchairs and hold their hands together and say, you know, excuse me, coming through and starting fights.
[01:36:03.158 --> 01:36:06.801]  So the bullies trying to end our free speech, they're the heroes.
[01:36:06.801 --> 01:36:09.163]  And then anybody who has a First Amendment, it's their fault.
[01:36:13.783 --> 01:36:25.469]  RIT people, and we got big companies that run it, say it's the biggest denial of service attack that InfoWars has ever seen, and that it was as big as the ones they hit Google with, or they hit like Apple with.
[01:36:25.469 --> 01:36:27.651]  It's a major industrial attack.
[01:36:27.651 --> 01:36:30.792]  This is why, and if I say this, they'll probably target the other one too.
[01:36:30.792 --> 01:36:31.933]  Fine.
[01:36:31.933 --> 01:36:34.154]  That which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
[01:36:34.154 --> 01:36:39.237]  Our listeners will hear this and will respond, no matter what, to keep us going and operating.
[01:36:41.018 --> 01:36:43.203]  We have two high-tech shopping carts.
[01:36:43.203 --> 01:36:48.474]  We have the old one that's been updated, but that we are slowly phasing out, but it's linked all over Google.
[01:36:48.474 --> 01:36:50.899]  It's still where we get the majority of our traffic and support.
[01:36:51.991 --> 01:36:55.695]  The one that our regular listeners go to is InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:36:55.695 --> 01:36:57.176]  That's not the one being hit.
[01:36:57.176 --> 01:36:59.558]  Anthony, describe the one that is being hit.
[01:36:59.558 --> 01:37:07.005]  I'm not a mega tech expert or anything, but I did just speak to some of the biggest experts out there that are hosting the InfoWars servers and stuff.
[01:37:07.005 --> 01:37:14.672]  And it looks like Store.InfoWars.com right now is being hit with a DDoS, a direct denial of service attack, which is basically where
[01:37:15.373 --> 01:37:21.375]  Most cases they get in control of other people's computers where they use like a big thick fiber and they just blast your weapon.
[01:37:21.375 --> 01:37:21.855]  Zombie attack.
[01:37:21.855 --> 01:37:23.415]  Yeah, it's a zombie attack.
[01:37:23.415 --> 01:37:25.315]  And this one is super big.
[01:37:25.315 --> 01:37:29.477]  It's as big as one that, you know, would take down Apple or anything like that.
[01:37:29.477 --> 01:37:34.838]  So we have tons of fail safes going on and I spoke to them for a minute back there before I came on to talk about this other stuff.
[01:37:35.518 --> 01:37:36.999]  And they said, yeah, this is really big.
[01:37:36.999 --> 01:37:39.280]  We're probably not going to be able to sustain it for much longer.
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:41.681]  We're going to go to fail safes over and over again.
[01:37:41.681 --> 01:37:43.822]  But I mean, it looks like a really, really concerted effort.
[01:37:43.822 --> 01:37:45.683]  It's been happening for hours and hours now.
[01:37:45.683 --> 01:37:46.463]  Absolutely.
[01:37:46.463 --> 01:37:48.765]  So again, this is their attempt.
[01:37:48.765 --> 01:37:51.966]  This is the old site that's linked all over Google, all over everywhere.
[01:37:51.966 --> 01:37:55.808]  It is where we get one of our main funding sources, the biggest.
[01:37:55.808 --> 01:38:01.771]  So again, they're attacking directly at the oxygen supply of InfoWars, directly at your First Amendment.
[01:38:01.771 --> 01:38:03.312]  You see where all this goes.
[01:38:04.676 --> 01:38:10.981]  And so the answer is go to InfoWarsTore.com and take advantage of some of the biggest sales we've ever had running right now.
[01:38:10.981 --> 01:38:18.526]  And then of course if they were to shut everything down forever, we'll just go to phones and go to donations and people, I bet we'll bring in even more money just with pure donations.
[01:38:18.526 --> 01:38:18.987]  How about that?
[01:38:19.827 --> 01:38:22.969]  And then you're going to have to come actually set me up or arrest me, see?
[01:38:22.969 --> 01:38:26.491]  Because we're not just going to feel sorry for ourselves like victims.
[01:38:26.491 --> 01:38:28.932]  People love to get attacked and then quit.
[01:38:28.932 --> 01:38:29.932]  I'm done!
[01:38:29.932 --> 01:38:30.833]  I got attacked!
[01:38:30.833 --> 01:38:31.833]  I got hacked!
[01:38:31.833 --> 01:38:32.814]  I got demonized!
[01:38:32.814 --> 01:38:36.215]  I was in a thousand newspapers yesterday being lied about.
[01:38:36.215 --> 01:38:40.218]  People come and they go, man, I saw you in the front page of the paper, what they said about you, how you take it.
[01:38:40.218 --> 01:38:42.099]  And I go, man, I'm taking it great.
[01:38:42.099 --> 01:38:44.440]  I want to fight these anti-human traitors.
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:45.140]  I love it.
[01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:46.321]  Man, this is great.
[01:38:46.321 --> 01:38:46.821]  Woo!
[01:38:46.821 --> 01:38:48.262]  Get the champagne, baby!
[01:38:49.195 --> 01:38:49.555]  Get it?!
[01:38:49.555 --> 01:38:52.278]  Because I came here to fight!
[01:38:52.278 --> 01:38:53.240]  I'm not playing games!
[01:38:54.977 --> 01:38:55.938]  Don't you get it?
[01:38:55.938 --> 01:38:57.600]  I'm committed.
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:05.707]  And so again, we've got the biggest sale ever on high quality storable foods at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:39:05.707 --> 01:39:08.710]  InfoWarsLife.com is a subdirectory into that.
[01:39:08.710 --> 01:39:19.100]  And you can simply go there and you can get 30 to 40% off right now on InfoWarsStore.com on all InfoWars select super high quality storable foods.
[01:39:19.961 --> 01:39:26.885]  These are super high quality, last 25 years, made right here in America by great patriots, powered by My Patriot Supply.
[01:39:26.885 --> 01:39:30.166]  We have My Patriot Supply products, the exact same food right next to it.
[01:39:30.166 --> 01:39:31.967]  Packaged the same time, it's a different label.
[01:39:31.967 --> 01:39:40.212]  I'm able contractually to basically get out of my profit to undercut everyone and then become the market leader.
[01:39:40.212 --> 01:39:41.833]  That's what loss leaders are about.
[01:39:41.833 --> 01:39:43.714]  We make about 10% when we go this low.
[01:39:44.696 --> 01:39:48.257]  So, administratively, we're pretty much losing money after taxes and regulations.
[01:39:48.257 --> 01:39:49.698]  We only do this a few times a year.
[01:39:49.698 --> 01:39:51.098]  24-hour flash sale.
[01:39:51.098 --> 01:39:52.999]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:39:52.999 --> 01:39:55.339]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:39:55.339 --> 01:39:57.380]  And InfoWarsStore is not getting hit.
[01:39:57.380 --> 01:40:00.201]  They're hitting the store that still gets the most traffic.
[01:40:00.201 --> 01:40:07.823]  And our answer is we're already building a third site separately, and that's why I do this, is the attacks over the years.
[01:40:07.823 --> 01:40:10.844]  So, we will be launching not just a third now, but a fourth.
[01:40:10.844 --> 01:40:11.925]  Because my rule is,
[01:40:12.785 --> 01:40:21.508]  In Operation Hydra, and we're not a bad Hydra, we're a good Hydra, but we learned from the enemy that when you cut one head off, two more sprout!
[01:40:21.508 --> 01:40:22.249]  See how that works?
[01:40:22.249 --> 01:40:25.170]  And of course that comes back to victory as well.
[01:40:25.170 --> 01:40:28.831]  Cut one off, two more come back out.
[01:40:28.831 --> 01:40:29.671]  See that?
[01:40:29.671 --> 01:40:31.472]  Cut one off, two more.
[01:40:31.472 --> 01:40:33.313]  Cut two off, four.
[01:40:33.313 --> 01:40:35.394]  Cut five off, ten come back.
[01:40:35.394 --> 01:40:36.154]  Do the math!
[01:40:37.168 --> 01:40:41.130]  Plus this is such an old school tactic to attack someone and try to get their website down.
[01:40:41.130 --> 01:40:42.070]  Don't they understand?
[01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:44.651]  It's going to come on air and people are just going to support InfoWars more.
[01:40:44.651 --> 01:40:45.532]  They're going to go to the store.
[01:40:45.532 --> 01:40:48.293]  They're going to want to see it for themselves and they're going to want to fight back.
[01:40:48.293 --> 01:40:49.854]  Like this is such an old school technique.
[01:40:49.854 --> 01:40:50.234]  That's right.
[01:40:50.234 --> 01:40:55.116]  In fact, I want to put the PayPal on the front page when Watson writes an article about this.
[01:40:55.116 --> 01:40:56.237]  And I just want to see...
[01:40:57.383 --> 01:41:03.968]  You know, folks that want to just flat-out donate to us, so we can have more reporters, more writers, do more, more people in the field.
[01:41:03.968 --> 01:41:05.249]  I mean, they hate what we're doing.
[01:41:05.249 --> 01:41:06.429]  They hate the exponential growth.
[01:41:06.429 --> 01:41:10.072]  I mean, I go look at our graphs, they're all just straight up, and it really freaks the system out.
[01:41:10.072 --> 01:41:12.053]  So, take advantage of a bunch of great specials.
[01:41:12.053 --> 01:41:14.035]  Supermill Vitality's back in stock.
[01:41:14.035 --> 01:41:15.576]  Anthroplex is back in stock.
[01:41:15.576 --> 01:41:18.698]  Get BrainForce, the best nootropic out there.
[01:41:18.698 --> 01:41:21.360]  They're a bunch of leading competitors that are $60 to $80 a bottle.
[01:41:23.141 --> 01:41:36.347]  I was in a store the other day and ran into a listener and behind their counter they had one of the other big brands that's $70, the same amount of pills, but just a bigger bottle, some of the same ingredients but ours are better and has more on top of it.
[01:41:36.347 --> 01:41:37.748]  I'm not competing, I just can't believe.
[01:41:39.264 --> 01:41:45.850]  And I said to him, I said, wow, you know, they target folks by something being too much because then people think it must be the best.
[01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:47.812]  We have something better.
[01:41:47.812 --> 01:41:53.657]  Some of the same ingredients, but even better ingredients added for literally less than half the price.
[01:41:53.657 --> 01:41:54.798]  And the woman goes, yeah, I know.
[01:41:54.798 --> 01:41:57.481]  I tend to buy whatever I think is the most expensive.
[01:41:57.481 --> 01:41:59.803]  No, folks, I morally can't do that.
[01:42:01.209 --> 01:42:05.271]  And I don't blame the radio network having some ads that I don't agree with, because that's just how radio is.
[01:42:05.271 --> 01:42:07.913]  But I sit here and get mad every time I hear some of them, okay?
[01:42:07.913 --> 01:42:09.154]  I mean, I'm gonna be honest.
[01:42:09.154 --> 01:42:10.655]  It's superstition is really what it is.
[01:42:10.655 --> 01:42:11.815]  It's not even superstition.
[01:42:11.815 --> 01:42:12.576]  It's sixth sense.
[01:42:12.576 --> 01:42:14.457]  It's my gut.
[01:42:14.457 --> 01:42:17.318]  It's not that I'm sociopathic.
[01:42:17.318 --> 01:42:18.819]  And so I know the laws of nature.
[01:42:18.819 --> 01:42:19.980]  I don't want to screw people over.
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:22.001]  I already feel like that in my DNA.
[01:42:22.001 --> 01:42:23.042]  I'm a good, loving person.
[01:42:24.127 --> 01:42:27.432]  But at the same time, just in business, it's not good to screw people over.
[01:42:27.432 --> 01:42:33.241]  It's not good to give... I mean, we make a profit to run the operation, we're into capitalism, but I just don't get...
[01:42:34.181 --> 01:42:42.584]  It's like that millionaire app they had a few years ago, or billionaire app, and people would go out and get it, even though it cost thousands of dollars, did nothing, to say, look, I've got the billionaire app.
[01:42:42.584 --> 01:42:55.227]  Hey, look, remember when that vitamin guy came over here, one of the biggest vitamin manufacturers, and he said, look, behind the scenes we're talking about this, I think we've brought this up maybe once, if people knew the full story, he said, hey, why don't you mark your stuff up like three or four more times?
[01:42:55.227 --> 01:42:56.788]  That's what all the other stores are doing.
[01:42:56.788 --> 01:42:58.528]  You could make so much more profit, so you could make 200%.
[01:42:58.528 --> 01:43:01.109]  You gotta mark it up over and over again.
[01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:02.089]  You go to Whole Foods.
[01:43:02.089 --> 01:43:03.830]  Why do you put such fancy stuff in your
[01:43:04.150 --> 01:43:13.517]  Yeah, but if you go to Whole Foods, something like Brain Force, or something like Supermeal, God, it would be 3-4 times X. Because you have to put that in when you put it into the brick and mortar stores.
[01:43:13.517 --> 01:43:19.842]  But, he was also telling us, they would just sweep up the floors, like the herbs would fall off the floors from the conveyor- Not the guy we use!
[01:43:19.842 --> 01:43:21.103]  He was talking about the competitor.
[01:43:21.303 --> 01:43:23.385]  He's talking about other companies that we're not going to name.
[01:43:23.385 --> 01:43:29.470]  They would just sweep the floors with herbs that fell off the conveyor belt and just throw it back on the belt.
[01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:30.110]  They don't care.
[01:43:30.110 --> 01:43:37.897]  Meanwhile, we have three companies, one of them Group, that is so neurotic about having everything be California standard, totally clean, totally organic.
[01:43:38.377 --> 01:43:42.064]  Flipping out that half the time we don't have products and we just can't make them perfect.
[01:43:42.064 --> 01:43:42.424]  True.
[01:43:42.424 --> 01:43:49.216]  And I'll be honest, I've said, listen, we can be the best, but we need to have the product and be the best at the point to have the product.
[01:43:49.216 --> 01:43:50.878]  But these companies are so good, they go, no.
[01:43:50.878 --> 01:43:51.499]  So I have.
[01:43:53.598 --> 01:44:01.222]  Quite frankly, cult-level groups, when I say cult, I mean like cult film, cult, just obsessed with giving you the best quality.
[01:44:01.222 --> 01:44:02.183]  And it's true!
[01:44:02.183 --> 01:44:04.404]  So, no brag, just fact.
[01:44:04.404 --> 01:44:08.906]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, it is amazing.
[01:44:08.906 --> 01:44:10.807]  And that's what's going on right now.
[01:44:10.807 --> 01:44:15.730]  Get BrainForce, get Knockout, get the new joint formula, infowarslife.com.
[01:44:16.050 --> 01:44:17.230]  Other great folks are Young Jebby.
[01:44:17.230 --> 01:44:18.951]  They have really high quality products as well.
[01:44:18.951 --> 01:44:20.692]  Infowarshealth.com.
[01:44:20.692 --> 01:44:26.113]  And you can also go to infowarsteam.com to sign up, become a distributor, get big discounts, sign up for auto ship, get free shipping.
[01:44:26.113 --> 01:44:28.374]  Infowarsteam.com, infowarshealth.com.
[01:44:28.374 --> 01:44:33.416]  But when it comes to quality, infowarslife.com is the standard.
[01:44:33.416 --> 01:44:35.857]  Now again, you notice we always plug, you're the listeners.
[01:44:36.721 --> 01:45:01.026]  We always plug... And we weren't going to plug, by the way, until there was a mega attack on the store that was big enough to... Yeah, and we're not going to let them win, and we wanted you to know this, that it really, they're trying to keep us free speech from getting out, they're trying to keep the fuel from being loaded in our engines so we can get off the ground as B-52s with huge loads of weaponry of truth that we're going to fly over globalist operations and hammer them to Hades.
[01:45:01.026 --> 01:45:02.806]  Now we'll get into the reason you came in here.
[01:45:04.213 --> 01:45:14.756]  But I want to get Watson or whoever to write a story about this immediately because folks need to know this is happening and this is going on in a big way.
[01:45:14.756 --> 01:45:19.398]  Now the reason I got you in here is we've had Dr. Blaylock on.
[01:45:19.398 --> 01:45:27.641]  We've also had the famous vaccine doctor that lives here in Austin, Texas in talking about it.
[01:45:27.641 --> 01:45:28.621]  That's what his research
[01:45:29.441 --> 01:45:34.883]  Also, Dr. Wakefield, who his partner's now been cleared in England, he's suing and trying to be cleared.
[01:45:34.883 --> 01:45:45.806]  It turns out that the research paper saying that he defrauded everybody wasn't true, and that they knew that there were two different British studies that were secret a decade before his on gut flora and vaccines.
[01:45:45.806 --> 01:45:54.489]  So what he found was such good research, that's why they had that whole funded Eli Lilly hoax and all that, that he'd been proven to be a liar.
[01:45:54.489 --> 01:45:55.129]  None of it was true!
[01:45:56.923 --> 01:45:58.287]  But here it is, folks.
[01:45:58.287 --> 01:46:00.273]  This is from Bloomberg Business.
[01:46:01.485 --> 01:46:05.306]  How gut bacteria are shaking up cancer research.
[01:46:05.306 --> 01:46:16.170]  Top scientists, Roche Holding, A.G., and Zastrozenega are seizing up potential allies in the fight against cancer.
[01:46:16.170 --> 01:46:26.933]  The trillions of bacteria that live in the human body, and then they go on to say, five years ago if you asked me about bacteria in your gut playing an important role in your systemic immune response, I probably would have laughed it off.
[01:46:26.933 --> 01:46:28.314]  Daniel Chen, head of the Cancer
[01:46:29.154 --> 01:46:42.706]  Immunotherapy research at the Roaches Genetec division said in a phone interview, and they just go through the whole thing that, oh my god, cancer, oh my god, autism, oh my god, all of it, it's all happening in the gut.
[01:46:42.706 --> 01:46:55.176]  These kids have such toxic bacteria and such toxic yeast and other garbage and fungus in their guts that's allowed because of the flora that the GMO causes.
[01:46:55.176 --> 01:46:56.878]  And then the vaccines grow in that as well.
[01:46:57.538 --> 01:47:02.322]  That they're bombed out of their brain all the time, literally like they're on drugs.
[01:47:02.322 --> 01:47:04.925]  And that's what, it's time to get Wakefield in here, he said.
[01:47:04.925 --> 01:47:10.649]  And we have the British studies too, but here they are now in Bloomberg, acting like they just discovered this.
[01:47:10.649 --> 01:47:16.955]  And so I was going back to my research, I was saying, what does Dr. Group, who harps on this 24-7 for 20 years, say?
[01:47:16.955 --> 01:47:23.501]  He says, you've got to have probiotics, you've got to have the proper vitamin D, you've got to have other things.
[01:47:23.501 --> 01:47:25.082]  And then Anthony came running in saying,
[01:47:25.302 --> 01:47:26.803]  Alex, look at these studies.
[01:47:26.803 --> 01:47:29.904]  This is what group says it's the pure iodine.
[01:47:29.904 --> 01:47:36.207]  And that's why when you first go on this two weeks in, you may get diarrhea and things because the good bacteria can live in it.
[01:47:36.207 --> 01:47:40.990]  The bad ones and the yeast and the other garbage, they can't.
[01:47:40.990 --> 01:47:43.231]  So it changes the intestinal flora.
[01:47:43.231 --> 01:47:45.952]  And it's just as important as probiotics.
[01:47:45.952 --> 01:47:47.132]  But the probiotics are key.
[01:47:47.132 --> 01:47:51.454]  We don't sell those yet because all of our people are so up to the newest standards.
[01:47:51.454 --> 01:47:52.775]  We've got to have the best.
[01:47:52.775 --> 01:47:54.216]  I just want to have the best we can get.
[01:47:54.616 --> 01:47:56.999]  Because I need to fund this operation.
[01:47:56.999 --> 01:47:59.301]  They're even more out of control than I am.
[01:47:59.301 --> 01:48:00.843]  I'm just being honest with you.
[01:48:00.843 --> 01:48:03.506]  So, Anthony, you've got like 15 articles here.
[01:48:03.506 --> 01:48:06.209]  Well, document Cam, tell folks about X2.
[01:48:06.209 --> 01:48:07.350]  Yes, it's a plug.
[01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:09.673]  A plug that's key.
[01:48:09.673 --> 01:48:11.315]  Your intestine is under attack.
[01:48:12.075 --> 01:48:19.363]  The Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are on record running giant research labs on how to target it.
[01:48:19.363 --> 01:48:20.425]  This is amazing.
[01:48:20.425 --> 01:48:27.713]  And the fact that they're coming out with this now means they're about to come out with their fancy treatments for it that are prescription and cost thousands of dollars.
[01:48:27.713 --> 01:48:32.077]  So again, make you sick, then come in with their solution.
[01:48:32.077 --> 01:48:33.379]  Anthony Gucciardi, tell us about it.
[01:48:33.459 --> 01:48:35.140]  This is a really expansive topic.
[01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:37.541]  I mean, it's extreme.
[01:48:37.541 --> 01:48:41.643]  So the article, right, it's in Bloomberg, how gut bacteria is shaking up cancer research.
[01:48:41.643 --> 01:48:51.209]  AstraZeneca, a lot of the immunologists are saying, five years ago, it's a quote, if you had asked me about bacteria in your gut playing an important role in your systemic immune response, I would have laughed it off.
[01:48:51.209 --> 01:48:51.949]  So he would have laughed.
[01:48:51.949 --> 01:48:52.769]  Guess who he would have laughed at?
[01:48:52.769 --> 01:48:53.970]  He would have laughed at me.
[01:48:53.970 --> 01:48:54.290]  Because in 2011,
[01:48:56.192 --> 01:48:57.593]  And you know, you've been talking about this.
[01:48:57.593 --> 01:48:58.573]  You wrote this article.
[01:48:58.573 --> 01:49:00.014]  No, you know more about than I do.
[01:49:00.014 --> 01:49:00.954]  Just toot your horn.
[01:49:00.954 --> 01:49:02.915]  Let's see the article.
[01:49:02.915 --> 01:49:07.298]  It says antibiotics could be to blame for skyrocketing mental illness rates.
[01:49:07.298 --> 01:49:11.800]  And I followed up with antibiotics promote obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome.
[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:14.901]  And I talk about the exact link they're talking about there in 2011.
[01:49:14.901 --> 01:49:16.862]  And then what happened?
[01:49:16.862 --> 01:49:17.883]  Now they admit it's cancer.
[01:49:18.163 --> 01:49:21.245]  Was, I was attacked, I was told I was crazy, right?
[01:49:21.245 --> 01:49:28.149]  But then, wait a minute, Scientific American comes out in 2015, March 1st, says what?
[01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:36.175]  Mental health may depend on creatures in the gut, followed up by pretty much every major news organization on the planet.
[01:49:36.175 --> 01:49:38.296]  I want Wakefield, he lives 10 minutes from here.
[01:49:38.296 --> 01:49:40.017]  I want him in studio tomorrow.
[01:49:40.137 --> 01:49:43.860]  Huffington Post, surprising link between gut bacteria and anxiety.
[01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:47.122]  Tech News, researchers find link between gut bacteria and mental health.
[01:49:47.122 --> 01:49:49.924]  The same thing I said in 2011.
[01:49:49.924 --> 01:49:51.466]  We've got to shoot a special report on this.
[01:49:51.466 --> 01:49:52.666]  This is so huge.
[01:49:52.666 --> 01:50:01.333]  And then you add to that, they admit that cancer is communicable from the vaccines, New York Times.
[01:50:01.333 --> 01:50:02.414]  Anthony, do you think
[01:50:04.423 --> 01:50:06.284]  They're losing so they're having to admit the truth?
[01:50:06.284 --> 01:50:06.984]  Or what's happening?
[01:50:06.984 --> 01:50:09.105]  Because they knew this because they did this.
[01:50:09.105 --> 01:50:10.986]  They do this in the 20s in rat studies.
[01:50:10.986 --> 01:50:12.566]  Why are they suddenly telling the truth?
[01:50:12.566 --> 01:50:20.310]  The medical establishment consistently has just been putting out flagrant disinformation and the researchers that aren't, no one's, not everyone's bought off, right?
[01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:23.411]  So the researchers actually look into this, like this guy's saying, oh my god, what's happening?
[01:50:24.531 --> 01:50:27.533]  We've known this for 2,000 years, that gut is the center of your health.
[01:50:27.533 --> 01:50:33.657]  That's why if you go to Eastern Europe or Asia or everywhere, they call it medicine to eat like rotting fish, rotting vegetables.
[01:50:33.657 --> 01:50:35.098]  You want the bacteria.
[01:50:35.098 --> 01:50:36.318]  I mean, look at this article.
[01:50:36.318 --> 01:50:40.401]  Your bacteria is destroyed by just 10 days of eating processed food like McDonald's.
[01:50:40.401 --> 01:50:40.961]  It's just destroyed.
[01:50:40.961 --> 01:50:45.464]  And I've taken 20 rounds of antibiotics in my lifetime for ear infections when I was younger and stuff.
[01:50:45.464 --> 01:50:47.665]  Man, I had to research this my whole life.
[01:50:47.665 --> 01:50:49.066]  It's totally, all the news is out there.
[01:50:49.366 --> 01:50:52.227]  And again, you discovered all this because you got Lyme disease and had to cure yourself.
[01:50:52.227 --> 01:50:52.947]  They couldn't help you.
[01:50:52.947 --> 01:50:53.928]  It's true.
[01:50:53.928 --> 01:50:54.528]  It's incredible.
[01:50:54.528 --> 01:50:55.108]  We'll be back.
[01:50:55.108 --> 01:50:55.588]  Stay with us.
[01:50:55.588 --> 01:50:58.990]  This is Key Intel.
[01:50:58.990 --> 01:50:59.330]  Hi there.
[01:50:59.330 --> 01:51:01.510]  Are you an unhappy timeshare owner?
[01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:04.572]  Have you ever asked yourself, how can I get rid of my timeshare?
[01:51:04.572 --> 01:51:07.613]  Does your story go something like Stacy's story goes?
[01:51:07.613 --> 01:51:08.613]  Here's Stacy now.
[01:51:08.613 --> 01:51:13.875]  My husband and I went and visited a resort and they kind of attacked us.
[01:51:14.355 --> 01:51:22.223]  And they kept sending more and more people until we finally said yes and we bought this timeshare and then we were stuck in this timeshare that we couldn't get rid of and we tried all different ways.
[01:51:22.223 --> 01:51:35.916]  They made it seem like it was this really great deal and when we said no originally then they brought the price down and then when we still said no they brought in the manager and they brought the price down even lower and they started breaking out in different ways to make it look like it was this really awesome deal.
[01:51:35.916 --> 01:51:37.798]  The reality was it wasn't an awesome deal at all.
[01:51:38.038 --> 01:51:41.320]  To cancel your timeshare contract, call ACC today.

[01:53:28.522 --> 01:53:29.902]  You know about RVs.
[01:53:29.902 --> 01:53:31.363]  You've heard about bunkers.
[01:53:31.363 --> 01:53:34.124]  But surviving is not recreation.
[01:53:34.124 --> 01:53:36.864]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[01:54:05.246 --> 01:54:18.415]  Folks, I start ranting and raving and getting excited because Bill and Melinda Gates, for 20 plus years that I know of, have spent billions researching gut flora and gut disorders.
[01:54:18.415 --> 01:54:24.159]  And everything from Crohn's to you name it, things that didn't exist 30, 40 years ago, is just ubiquitous now.
[01:54:24.159 --> 01:54:25.540]  It's everywhere.
[01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:27.021]  Neurological disorders, you name it.
[01:54:29.039 --> 01:54:43.068]  And in the gut of autistic children, Dr. Wakefield and others, other studies, found antibodies for the measles vaccines and things like that that shouldn't be there.
[01:54:45.458 --> 01:54:47.599]  And the guts are seriously screwed up.
[01:54:47.599 --> 01:54:50.199]  And you add all these pesticides, the rest of it in.
[01:54:50.199 --> 01:54:51.960]  Now, we went over the science.
[01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:53.280]  I'm gonna do a document cam again.
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:55.641]  Go back through those articles for folks.
[01:54:55.641 --> 01:54:58.022]  But the gut is the front line of your entire body.
[01:54:58.022 --> 01:55:01.123]  It's where you put the foreign food in.
[01:55:01.123 --> 01:55:02.863]  It's where you get the energy.
[01:55:02.863 --> 01:55:08.385]  And then the blood vessels all around your intestines take those nutrients to run the body.
[01:55:08.385 --> 01:55:14.927]  You put a bunch of pesticides, you put a bunch of GMO, you put a bunch of processed dead food in there, you take antibiotics,
[01:55:16.385 --> 01:55:21.289]  All you end up with is antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
[01:55:21.289 --> 01:55:24.972]  And not the good bacteria.
[01:55:24.972 --> 01:55:30.776]  So, doing the research, and we're saying this because yes, it funds us, but it's also what you need.
[01:55:30.776 --> 01:55:34.919]  Break down the iodine research and how important it is to have that in the gut.
[01:55:34.919 --> 01:55:39.183]  So, you know, when you take antibiotics, which by the way are an amazing thing, it's an amazing breakthrough.
[01:55:39.183 --> 01:55:42.145]  Most of us, you know, would have died at certain points in our life without antibiotics.
[01:55:42.145 --> 01:55:44.787]  But it's a side effect and you need to know how to recuperate from it.
[01:55:44.787 --> 01:55:45.688]  Right, it's a double-edged sword.
[01:55:45.688 --> 01:55:48.170]  It goes in, it kills the bad stuff, sure.
[01:55:48.170 --> 01:55:51.172]  Kills the bad bacteria, but it also kills the good bacteria.
[01:55:51.172 --> 01:55:52.673]  And the good bacteria is what you need to live.
[01:55:52.673 --> 01:55:54.154]  It's what you need to sustain life.
[01:55:54.154 --> 01:55:56.716]  And for me, you know, I had ear infections, Lyme disease, everything.
[01:55:56.716 --> 01:55:58.718]  My doctor didn't say, hey, take probiotics.
[01:55:58.718 --> 01:56:00.199]  I had like 20 rounds of probiotics.
[01:56:00.199 --> 01:56:01.840]  My gut was supremely screwed up.
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:03.722]  So I did all the research, found out things for myself.
[01:56:04.102 --> 01:56:05.523]  So I was writing about it five years ago.
[01:56:05.523 --> 01:56:09.985]  That's why this guy says, if you had told me this five years ago, I would have said you're crazy and laughed at you.
[01:56:09.985 --> 01:56:11.465]  Yeah, he would have laughed at me.
[01:56:11.465 --> 01:56:12.426]  But it is true.
[01:56:12.426 --> 01:56:15.447]  McDonald's destroys the gut bacteria of a college kid in ten days.
[01:56:15.447 --> 01:56:17.848]  This is a professor who did this research, okay?
[01:56:17.848 --> 01:56:19.649]  So, there's so many different connections here.
[01:56:19.989 --> 01:56:22.792]  But one that is really, really interesting that I wanted to talk about.
[01:56:22.792 --> 01:56:24.494]  Again, it's an expansive, capacious topic.
[01:56:24.494 --> 01:56:28.698]  It would take a long time to even break down, but the thyroid-gut connection.
[01:56:28.698 --> 01:56:29.759]  Chris Kresser wrote this.
[01:56:29.759 --> 01:56:31.701]  There's a lot of other pieces on it, too.
[01:56:31.701 --> 01:56:32.822]  Life Extension talks about it.
[01:56:32.822 --> 01:56:37.246]  But the gut-thyroid-immune connection is really, really interesting to me.
[01:56:37.246 --> 01:56:39.629]  And it starts off with Hippocrates.
[01:56:39.629 --> 01:56:41.591]  All disease begins in the gut, is the quote, right?
[01:56:42.692 --> 01:56:46.715]  2,500 years later, here we are, we're trying to realize, wow, it might actually be true.
[01:56:46.715 --> 01:56:51.138]  It's 2016 and, you know, I would have told people they were crazy if they said that five years ago.
[01:56:51.138 --> 01:56:52.659]  How about 2,500 years ago?
[01:56:52.659 --> 01:56:53.120]  Huh?
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:54.160]  How about that?
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:57:02.367]  And the research, I don't know if we have time to fully get into it, but basically there are these thyroid hormones and they communicate properly with your gut and your gut
[01:57:05.094 --> 01:57:11.463]  A lot of people because of the fluoride have a thyroid that basically turned off and so they're dying.
[01:57:11.463 --> 01:57:12.965]  They're aging prematurely.
[01:57:12.965 --> 01:57:16.029]  I mean I know people personally in my family that have gotten on the iodine for two years.
[01:57:17.119 --> 01:57:18.560]  Lost weight, their skin's better.
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:19.761]  You tan better.
[01:57:19.761 --> 01:57:24.304]  I remember a group telling me three years ago, start taking this and your skin will get clearer.
[01:57:24.304 --> 01:57:26.325]  Conversely... I had all these liver spots.
[01:57:26.325 --> 01:57:27.265]  They almost all went away.
[01:57:27.265 --> 01:57:27.646]  Look at this.
[01:57:27.646 --> 01:57:35.431]  The kid that ate McDonald's for ten days to see if his gut flora would die, what happened is after his good gut flora died, he turned a shade of gray.
[01:57:35.431 --> 01:57:38.473]  According to this, it said it also turned him gray.
[01:57:38.473 --> 01:57:39.073]  Okay?
[01:57:39.073 --> 01:57:42.175]  That's what the study... Remember, the McDonald's food doesn't rot.
[01:57:43.171 --> 01:57:44.012]  No, it rots you.
[01:57:44.012 --> 01:57:44.952]  Nimrin supersized me.
[01:57:44.952 --> 01:57:46.533]  They put regular cheeseburger, it rots.
[01:57:46.533 --> 01:57:48.234]  There's like months later, nothing's happened.
[01:57:48.234 --> 01:57:49.555]  All processed junk.
[01:57:49.555 --> 01:57:51.716]  Mold won't even grow on it, folks.
[01:57:51.716 --> 01:57:55.999]  You're eating all that, you're taking antibiotics, you're not destroying the bad bacteria.
[01:57:55.999 --> 01:57:57.960]  Things like iodine are going to really help.
[01:57:57.960 --> 01:57:59.781]  And also, yeah, probiotic rich foods.
[01:57:59.781 --> 01:58:01.442]  But we're just sitting here eating death.
[01:58:01.442 --> 01:58:02.943]  We're eating dead junk food.
[01:58:02.943 --> 01:58:06.064]  And then we're saying, well, gee, it's almost like there's a link to cancer.
[01:58:06.064 --> 01:58:07.245]  Of course there's a link to cancer.
[01:58:07.245 --> 01:58:08.406]  That's Bloomberg business.
[01:58:08.906 --> 01:58:14.592]  Top scientific genetic engineer firms, drug companies, going, oh my gosh, it's the gut.
[01:58:14.592 --> 01:58:16.013]  That's why cancer's exploding.
[01:58:16.013 --> 01:58:17.314]  Everything's going through it.
[01:58:17.314 --> 01:58:19.056]  Your immune system turns off.
[01:58:19.056 --> 01:58:20.417]  Your gut gives up, folks.
[01:58:20.417 --> 01:58:21.839]  Game over.
[01:58:21.839 --> 01:58:26.063]  You know, my cedar fever's gotten a lot better when it comes through now because I eat the juniper berries.
[01:58:26.063 --> 01:58:28.565]  When they're about to pop, I just get them and eat them.
[01:58:28.565 --> 01:58:30.868]  I put them in a blender, blend them up with a smoothie, drink them.
[01:58:31.673 --> 01:58:32.434]  And that's the answer.
[01:58:32.434 --> 01:58:33.435]  I'm showing my gut.
[01:58:33.435 --> 01:58:34.135]  You eat this.
[01:58:34.135 --> 01:58:35.517]  You learn to deal with it.
[01:58:35.517 --> 01:58:36.498]  Dominate it!
[01:58:36.498 --> 01:58:37.138]  Yeah!
[01:58:37.138 --> 01:58:37.759]  We'll be back.

[01:59:37.173 --> 01:59:38.494]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[01:59:38.494 --> 01:59:39.774]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[02:00:08.067 --> 02:00:13.928]  I lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[02:00:13.928 --> 02:00:17.109]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:20.390]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:22.670]  Alright, Roger Stone's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:00:22.670 --> 02:00:28.572]  I was going to open the phones up for the next segment and I was about to get into North Korea claims it could wipe out Manhattan with a hydrogen bomb.
[02:00:28.572 --> 02:00:29.672]  Russia's threatening to invade.
[02:00:30.703 --> 02:00:34.108]  Russia is pivoting to the east in Asia where war is looming.
[02:00:34.108 --> 02:00:37.413]  And I was already thinking to myself, well, they don't want a two-front war.
[02:00:37.413 --> 02:00:39.375]  They're in Syria.
[02:00:39.375 --> 02:00:43.822]  Nico Acosta walked in and gave me this article about two minutes ago.
[02:00:47.145 --> 02:00:49.506]  The Washington Post, and I don't believe U.S.
[02:00:49.506 --> 02:00:54.407]  media sometimes, because I saw CNN say that Russia attacked Georgia in 2008, but I'm sure this is true.
[02:00:54.407 --> 02:00:56.147]  This is too bold, but we're checking it.
[02:00:56.147 --> 02:00:58.708]  Associated Press, the latest.
[02:00:58.708 --> 02:01:01.509]  Putin orders military pullout from Syria.
[02:01:01.509 --> 02:01:14.932]  They're pulling their entire military force out, their fighter bombers, all of it, since the 27th of February truce, they say has been basically followed, but they say the al-Qaeda people are still being bombed by coalition forces.
[02:01:14.932 --> 02:01:16.753]  I don't know what this signifies at this point.
[02:01:18.052 --> 02:01:26.217]  But Russia, it is in Russian news, Putin orders start of Russian military withdrawal from Syria, says objectives achieved.
[02:01:26.217 --> 02:01:33.401]  And the US military is now launching attacks on Al-Qaeda, and is basically ignoring the orders of Obama not to.
[02:01:33.401 --> 02:01:45.609]  So Russia has really played this skillfully, and has come in and given a real coalition time to form, has embarrassed the West into not backing Al-Qaeda,
[02:01:46.727 --> 02:01:55.992]  Saudi Arabia threatened to invade a month ago, and so they made the deal, and it appears that it's some type of armistice, or ceasefire.
[02:01:55.992 --> 02:02:02.735]  Now, we'll see if the West follows that deal, but this is very ominous.
[02:02:02.735 --> 02:02:06.277]  I told you I got up this morning with the most anxiety I've ever had, okay?
[02:02:06.277 --> 02:02:08.638]  I'm not somebody that has anxiety, I'm very confident.
[02:02:08.638 --> 02:02:15.522]  When I have it, when I start, it's more like, it's like right in the center of my mind, it starts going search, search, search, something big's about to happen.
[02:02:17.085 --> 02:02:18.106]  This could be it.
[02:02:18.106 --> 02:02:22.529]  This could signify all Hades is about to break loose on the Korean Peninsula.
[02:02:22.529 --> 02:02:27.032]  I'm going to think about this more and come back from the break and talk about it.
[02:02:27.032 --> 02:02:29.754]  Oh, I tell you, they got sleeper cells all over the place, too.
[02:02:29.754 --> 02:02:31.735]  They brought in the radical jihadis.
[02:02:31.735 --> 02:02:33.956]  I've got other intel.
[02:02:33.956 --> 02:02:36.618]  Also, on the Section 8 housing across the country, they're throwing U.S.
[02:02:36.618 --> 02:02:38.079]  citizens out and putting jihadis in.
[02:02:38.079 --> 02:02:39.180]  I have it all confirmed.
[02:02:40.655 --> 02:02:54.288]  I tell you, Anthony Guicciardi, I wanted to hold you over to get more into this huge news that top research facilities in the U.S., top drug companies go, okay, the gut has collapsed because of GMO and the pesticides and autism and cancer and everything.
[02:02:54.288 --> 02:02:56.831]  It's true.
[02:02:56.831 --> 02:02:58.432]  That's in Bloomberg business.
[02:02:58.432 --> 02:03:00.254]  That's so massive.
[02:03:00.254 --> 02:03:02.556]  They're coming out and admitting cancer is mainly communicable.
[02:03:02.556 --> 02:03:03.217]  That's massive.
[02:03:03.217 --> 02:03:03.858]  New York Times.
[02:03:06.246 --> 02:03:08.867]  And then meanwhile they're setting up war in North Korea.
[02:03:08.867 --> 02:03:10.968]  North Korea is asking to get nuked.
[02:03:10.968 --> 02:03:12.609]  I've never seen such rhetoric.
[02:03:12.609 --> 02:03:14.129]  What do you think's going on?
[02:03:14.129 --> 02:03:29.756]  Isn't it funny that Russia's making strategic military decisions and really precisely stating their objectives have been achieved and meanwhile in the United States we're fighting over whether, you know, hate speech is happening in certain cities and rallies are being shut down and the news is freaking out because people were offended.
[02:03:29.756 --> 02:03:33.078]  Like Russia's, you know, it could be, I'm not in Russia, I don't have that.
[02:03:33.558 --> 02:03:34.139]  I don't know.
[02:03:55.783 --> 02:04:02.726]  Knowing her, people that think they're pseudo-intellectuals, you know, because they've got, you know, cool pigtails or whatever and green socks.
[02:04:02.726 --> 02:04:06.568]  They're like, yeah, it's just a society of morons.
[02:04:06.568 --> 02:04:07.888]  That's led by criminals.
[02:04:07.888 --> 02:04:09.649]  It's been on my mind for a while.
[02:04:09.649 --> 02:04:11.090]  This is really, really important.
[02:04:11.090 --> 02:04:16.892]  People think that they're intelligent when they act pseudo-intellectual and try to use fake academia over you.
[02:04:16.892 --> 02:04:18.593]  Just like that, oh, Turkey, what are you talking about?
[02:04:18.593 --> 02:04:20.694]  They don't even know anything that's happening on this planet.
[02:04:21.254 --> 02:04:22.575]  You know what safe spaces are?
[02:04:22.575 --> 02:04:23.196]  They're fantasy lands.
[02:04:47.509 --> 02:04:48.750]  Well, people live in La La Land.
[02:04:48.750 --> 02:04:50.171]  It's not that much different, right?
[02:04:50.171 --> 02:04:50.772]  I know.
[02:04:50.772 --> 02:04:53.014]  These people live at Fantasy Island.
[02:04:53.014 --> 02:04:53.655]  They do.
[02:04:53.655 --> 02:04:58.419]  They're a bunch of bloated, stupid... I mean, go down to UT, folks.
[02:04:58.419 --> 02:05:09.709]  Action hero Jean-Claude Van Damme told a French television political show that the Rothschild and Rockefeller families will not let Donald Trump win the presidency.
[02:05:09.949 --> 02:05:12.870]  Because he is an anti-globalist candidate.
[02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:19.853]  Appearing on the Le Grand Journal, Van Damme said he was aware of who is really shaping U.S.
[02:05:19.853 --> 02:05:21.373]  presidential elections.
[02:05:21.373 --> 02:05:34.038]  Some of the other participants in the debate looked stunned, as Van Damme continued to say that the Rothschilds rose to power in 1827, and they now control and dominate entire continents.
[02:05:34.358 --> 02:05:38.222]  And he says Donald Trump is not going to win the election.
[02:05:38.222 --> 02:05:48.093]  He went on to make a distinction between lobbyists that control the other candidates and people like Donald Trump who is truly anti-establishment.

[02:08:08.752 --> 02:08:14.755]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:14.755 --> 02:08:17.997]  Please allow me to introduce myself.
[02:08:17.997 --> 02:08:23.240]  I'm a man of wealth and taste.
[02:08:23.240 --> 02:08:26.522]  Been around for a long, long year.
[02:08:26.522 --> 02:08:30.244]  So many a man sold to waste.
[02:08:30.244 --> 02:08:36.748]  I was right on when Jesus Christ had his moment of doubt and pain.
[02:08:40.251 --> 02:08:58.137]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:08:58.137 --> 02:08:58.517]  3 p.m.
[02:08:58.517 --> 02:08:59.698]  Central we broadcast live.
[02:09:01.937 --> 02:09:11.143]  I think you might want to look at this world government system and guess its name.
[02:09:11.143 --> 02:09:12.624]  Yeah, time for change in St.
[02:09:12.624 --> 02:09:13.104]  Petersburg.
[02:09:28.647 --> 02:09:31.229]  All right, let's start getting into the really serious news.
[02:09:31.229 --> 02:09:35.152]  This is super hardcore, folks.
[02:09:35.152 --> 02:09:37.414]  It's confirmed by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
[02:09:37.414 --> 02:09:43.339]  And it ties together with the North Korea situation.
[02:09:43.339 --> 02:09:46.421]  The latest Putin orders military pullout from Syria.
[02:09:46.421 --> 02:09:48.463]  This just broke in the last hour.
[02:09:51.374 --> 02:10:04.662]  In fact, literally the last 20 minutes, the latest on Syria, peace talks, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the start of the pullout of the Russian military from Syria starting tomorrow.
[02:10:04.662 --> 02:10:10.165]  Putin said the move should help serve as stimulus for serious political talks.
[02:10:10.165 --> 02:10:14.668]  The President said he coordinated the move with Syrian President Bashar Assad.
[02:10:15.731 --> 02:10:25.378]  Putin said the Russian air base in Syria's coastal province, a naval facility in the Syrian port of Tartarus, will continue to operate.
[02:10:25.378 --> 02:10:27.339]  But that's always basically been there.
[02:10:27.339 --> 02:10:32.283]  Russia says it has voiced concerns about the ceasefire violations by US-backed rebels in Syria.
[02:10:35.168 --> 02:10:42.492]  The Defense Ministry said Monday that the Russian Military Coordinated Center in Syria had a conference call with its U.S.
[02:10:42.492 --> 02:10:46.815]  counterpart in Amman province about violations of Russian and U.S.
[02:10:46.815 --> 02:10:53.179]  brokered troops by opposition units near the Amman province.
[02:10:53.179 --> 02:10:56.801]  It says militants in the area have been listed by the U.S.
[02:10:56.801 --> 02:11:00.904]  as abiding by the ceasefire when they're not.
[02:11:00.904 --> 02:11:04.486]  By the way, there are a bunch of chemical attacks over the weekend in Iraq by ISIS.
[02:11:05.879 --> 02:11:12.725]  Remember when Al-Qaeda slash ISIS launched chemical attacks in Syria and tried to blame the Syrian army for it?
[02:11:12.725 --> 02:11:16.207]  But the jihadists are manipulated but not fully controlled.
[02:11:16.207 --> 02:11:21.972]  There they were with the Saudi Arabian mortars firing the nerve gas.
[02:11:21.972 --> 02:11:24.894]  That was nerve gas, this is mustard gas.
[02:11:24.894 --> 02:11:27.837]  And screaming Allah Akbar and waving their Al-Qaeda flags.
[02:11:30.077 --> 02:11:32.940]  So this is how dumb they think we are.
[02:11:32.940 --> 02:11:43.451]  And they had Megyn Kelly and all the usual suspects go on the news and the CIA operative Anderson Cooper and say that Assad had done it and that they'd passed the red line.
[02:11:43.451 --> 02:11:44.252]  It didn't matter.
[02:11:44.252 --> 02:11:49.138]  Within a week, even the UN had to admit, okay, it was Saudi Arabia.
[02:11:49.138 --> 02:11:51.080]  And now Saudi Arabia is threatening to whole hog invade.
[02:11:53.092 --> 02:11:54.153]  And Russia's pulling out.
[02:11:54.153 --> 02:11:57.695]  Now, Russia came to the table, did a peace deal.
[02:11:57.695 --> 02:11:59.736]  They've knocked out ISIS in many areas.
[02:11:59.736 --> 02:12:00.176]  The U.S.
[02:12:00.176 --> 02:12:03.438]  has been shamed into actually fighting some of the ISIS forces.
[02:12:03.438 --> 02:12:07.760]  So I think it's too soon to tell exactly what's going on here.
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:13.744]  I'll tell you this though, the financial worldwide collapse, the pivot towards Asia, what North Korea is currently up to,
[02:12:16.525 --> 02:12:22.188]  My spider sense, as I've been saying all day, is the hottest it's ever been.
[02:12:22.188 --> 02:12:26.631]  I am beyond chills going up and down my back right now.
[02:12:26.631 --> 02:12:29.312]  But my mind is just searching, looking, what is it?
[02:12:29.312 --> 02:12:30.173]  Why are you so concerned?
[02:12:30.173 --> 02:12:37.877]  Because every time, I've talked about this only seven or eight times on air, this happening, every time I'm really freaked out, big stuff happens.
[02:12:46.263 --> 02:12:48.285]  It is so wild.
[02:12:48.285 --> 02:12:52.108]  Now, let's look at this article that ties into it, also out of the Washington Post.
[02:12:52.108 --> 02:12:57.652]  North Korea claims it could wipe out Manhattan with a hydrogen bomb.
[02:12:57.652 --> 02:13:02.996]  Just last week, they threatened to nuke Seoul, South Korea of over 10 million people.
[02:13:02.996 --> 02:13:04.998]  Just preemptively said, we'll blow you up.
[02:13:04.998 --> 02:13:08.901]  Russia then threatened with its foreign ministry to quote, invade.
[02:13:13.072 --> 02:13:26.543]  And all of you that worship the state and worship the power you get from it, you ought to worship Kim Jong-un as your fat rat, dictator, hereditary, just monster.
[02:13:26.543 --> 02:13:32.928]  He's spoiled, he's stupid, he's physically weak, he's evil, he thinks Dennis Rodman is cool, he has horrible taste.
[02:13:34.721 --> 02:13:49.950]  He's turned Korea that he controls, North Korea, into a living hellhole where humans are raised like animals and children are taken at birth and sent to other facilities so no one has a human connection.
[02:13:49.950 --> 02:13:54.933]  They tell the people in North Korea that birds sing and there's sunny weather because of him.
[02:13:56.769 --> 02:14:00.310]  Should we play the footage of people crying when his father died for three days?
[02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:05.333]  Those that didn't cry long enough were sent to forced labor camps because that's what produces there.
[02:14:05.333 --> 02:14:13.076]  You've got the little minders that boss everyone around and tell you what speech to use and how to behave, the political correct folks, the top ten percent.
[02:14:14.343 --> 02:14:27.089]  Who all feed on each other too, and then 90% living as chattel animals who don't even know where they are in the world, don't know how to write, and literally worship him as a god king.
[02:14:27.089 --> 02:14:32.992]  A god king.
[02:14:32.992 --> 02:14:36.094]  And now he's executing his family, executing his top generals.
[02:14:36.094 --> 02:14:37.074]  China's never done this.
[02:14:37.074 --> 02:14:39.395]  They have threatened him two weeks ago.
[02:14:39.395 --> 02:14:40.336]  They better stop it.
[02:14:41.209 --> 02:14:42.730]  Or they'll militarily respond.
[02:14:42.730 --> 02:14:44.191]  The Russians have threatened to invade.
[02:14:44.191 --> 02:14:47.453]  They're on their border.
[02:14:47.453 --> 02:14:56.839]  They're threatening to preemptively blow up South Korea and our filthy, degenerate, evil government under Bill Clinton.
[02:14:58.117 --> 02:15:04.800]  Gave them not one but two nuclear reactors that you can make fizzle material for atomic and hydrogen bombs with.
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:12.805]  I was on the air in 96, 97, 98 when conservatives and patriots fought the deal and they transferred the reactors.
[02:15:12.805 --> 02:15:22.270]  And CNN had headlines like, I'll never forget it, are members of Congress trying to block nuclear deal because they're anti-Asian and racist?
[02:15:22.270 --> 02:15:24.751]  I remember headlines on CNN and articles where they would say,
[02:15:26.220 --> 02:15:36.984]  Because all the Chinese generals would meet with Clinton in the White House, you know, and give donations, and we and others would cover it, and they would have headlines like, is all this anti-China fervor for racism?
[02:15:36.984 --> 02:15:44.247]  No, we just didn't want you to give our MIRV technology and our ICBM technology to them so they could blow up the United States.
[02:15:44.247 --> 02:15:54.391]  We didn't want you to give them cruise missile technology, or Minuteman technology, or Polaris technology, or Triton technology.
[02:15:54.391 --> 02:15:55.852]  They gave them everything.
[02:15:57.298 --> 02:16:07.400]  This is the government that wants to stick its hands down your pants and put you in a naked body scanner at the airport, put the borders wide open, and they're giving radical Muslims brought in by the tens of thousands a week.
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:08.080]  It's the real number.
[02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:09.180]  We have the big story.
[02:16:09.180 --> 02:16:13.661]  It's going to take major work to put it all out, but we already confirmed it.
[02:16:13.661 --> 02:16:20.683]  When you have the documents, the eyewitnesses, the reports, all of it, I have to then go discover it all for my own, not to hurt the whistleblowers.
[02:16:21.744 --> 02:16:24.286]  I have it, just over the top sensational.
[02:16:24.286 --> 02:16:37.498]  You think it's in Dallas, and in Austin, and in LA, and in New York City at LaGuardia, and JFK, where they're flying in whole planes of 140, 150, you know, and it's in the news.
[02:16:37.498 --> 02:16:39.379]  Oh, they flew in a bunch of illegals again.
[02:16:39.379 --> 02:16:42.082]  No one checked their IDs.
[02:16:42.082 --> 02:16:43.503]  They just walked through customs.
[02:16:46.115 --> 02:17:01.439]  That's because they are then bused to a federal facility and they are given social security cards and new names.
[02:17:01.439 --> 02:17:05.060]  Folks, but then, oh, you better have your ID on you.
[02:17:05.060 --> 02:17:06.200]  It's all a joke.
[02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:07.921]  We're wide open.
[02:17:07.921 --> 02:17:08.361]  Who was it?
[02:17:08.361 --> 02:17:12.342]  Was it Joe Biggs drove through the 80 mile, you know, into Texas checkpoint a few years ago?
[02:17:14.517 --> 02:17:16.937]  And they want to search the truck, and he goes, why should we?
[02:17:16.937 --> 02:17:17.898]  There's no border anyways.
[02:17:17.898 --> 02:17:19.558]  And they go, you're right, go on through.
[02:17:19.558 --> 02:17:23.259]  The Border Patrol doesn't like it.
[02:17:23.259 --> 02:17:28.680]  And then when Trump says we should do something, it's racist.
[02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:32.900]  How's everybody going to feel if nuclear war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula?
[02:17:32.900 --> 02:17:41.622]  As Joel Skousen has said to other top experts, if there's a nuclear exchange, it'll be about 24 hours before the big nuclear war with the Chinese Communist
[02:17:42.893 --> 02:17:45.256]  And the, quote, USA starts.
[02:17:45.256 --> 02:17:49.201]  And our own government gave them the missiles and gave them the material.
[02:17:49.201 --> 02:17:53.026]  Our government gave the Chinese the nukes.
[02:17:53.026 --> 02:17:54.949]  In the late 50s, early 60s.
[02:17:54.949 --> 02:17:58.654]  Our government, not the Rosenbergs, they were the Patsy's.
[02:17:58.654 --> 02:17:59.996]  They gave them the nukes!
[02:18:04.670 --> 02:18:07.191]  Because it's a big plan to bring down the whole world.
[02:18:07.191 --> 02:18:10.071]  It's an evil plan to depopulate.
[02:18:10.071 --> 02:18:14.952]  And all of you that think you're part of the system, you want to just keep denying what we're saying because it's scary.
[02:18:14.952 --> 02:18:15.793]  You're going to find out.
[02:18:15.793 --> 02:18:20.354]  I don't know if it's this month or next year or five years from now.
[02:18:20.354 --> 02:18:26.375]  But all the geopolitical strategists are on record saying a giant world war is on the front burner now.
[02:18:26.375 --> 02:18:29.036]  And you add economic collapse to that.
[02:18:29.036 --> 02:18:29.696]  Look at Greece.
[02:18:30.876 --> 02:18:37.921]  In Greece, 40% of loans and 55% of mortgages are not being paid down.
[02:18:37.921 --> 02:18:41.043]  People are leaving their kids at homeless shelters by the thousands.
[02:18:41.043 --> 02:18:42.384]  Suicide is off the chart.
[02:18:42.384 --> 02:18:44.345]  This is out of The Economist.
[02:18:44.345 --> 02:18:45.706]  The markets remain nervous.
[02:18:45.706 --> 02:18:49.269]  Bank shares are down 36 since the start of the year.
[02:18:49.269 --> 02:18:54.973]  Massive austerity, massive new taxes meant to further smother the economy and then buy it all up.
[02:18:56.940 --> 02:19:03.687]  Then they tell Greece, we want you to take hundreds of thousands of North African and Muslim invaders every month.
[02:19:03.687 --> 02:19:11.535]  One island, Greece has hundreds of islands, of Lesbos has had hundreds of thousands arrive at it in the last year.
[02:19:11.535 --> 02:19:14.098]  The island didn't have 5,000 people living on it.
[02:19:18.533 --> 02:19:22.076]  And then when the invasion happens, the liberal media just goes, be liberal, be laughing.
[02:19:22.076 --> 02:19:27.940]  Merkel's like, we'll work on the problem, just bringing them in, bringing them in, bringing them in to collapse everything.
[02:19:27.940 --> 02:19:32.984]  This is scientific takedown.
[02:19:32.984 --> 02:19:35.206]  And they want you to live like they do in Greece.
[02:19:35.206 --> 02:19:44.273]  And once you're poor, you're going to be working 18 hours a day, 16 hours a day, and you're never going to think about freedom or being an uppity again.
[02:19:44.273 --> 02:19:47.996]  And so the stairs to liberty, the stairs to wealth,
[02:19:49.122 --> 02:19:49.743]  Are being removed.
[02:19:49.743 --> 02:19:55.772]  It's like they're flying away in a hot air balloon and they're just pulling up the ladder going, bye bye dummies!
[02:19:55.772 --> 02:19:56.853]  Bye bye fools!

[02:20:58.547 --> 02:21:01.130]  Hi there, are you an unhappy timeshare owner?
[02:21:01.130 --> 02:21:04.193]  Have you ever asked yourself, how can I get rid of my timeshare?
[02:21:04.193 --> 02:21:07.256]  Does your story go something like Stacey's story goes?
[02:21:07.256 --> 02:21:08.257]  Here's Stacey now.
[02:21:08.257 --> 02:21:13.543]  My husband and I went and visited a resort and they kind of attacked us.
[02:21:14.123 --> 02:21:14.684]  We're good to go.
[02:21:37.659 --> 02:21:40.943]  To cancel your timeshare contract, call ACC today.

[02:21:58.408 --> 02:22:02.573]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[02:22:02.573 --> 02:22:08.779]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[02:22:08.779 --> 02:22:10.541]  How is this even possible?
[02:22:10.541 --> 02:22:17.849]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[02:22:18.069 --> 02:22:26.036]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[02:22:26.036 --> 02:22:30.399]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[02:22:30.399 --> 02:22:39.187]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[02:22:39.187 --> 02:22:40.768]  But you must act fast.
[02:22:40.768 --> 02:22:45.292]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard, our supply is extremely limited right now.
[02:22:45.572 --> 02:22:49.714]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[02:22:49.714 --> 02:22:51.514]  That's Greens75.com.

[02:23:24.754 --> 02:23:27.135]  From the Robert Allen System, current returns not indicative of future results.
[02:23:27.782 --> 02:23:30.843]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[02:23:30.843 --> 02:23:33.464]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[02:23:33.464 --> 02:23:34.204]  Croix River.
[02:23:34.204 --> 02:23:36.445]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[02:23:36.445 --> 02:23:39.406]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[02:23:39.406 --> 02:23:40.286]  His excuse?
[02:23:40.286 --> 02:23:41.606]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[02:23:41.606 --> 02:23:43.227]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[02:23:43.227 --> 02:23:48.988]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[02:23:48.988 --> 02:23:50.029]  Don't wait.
[02:23:50.029 --> 02:23:52.670]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now.
[02:23:52.670 --> 02:23:55.170]  For not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved ones.
[02:23:55.170 --> 02:23:56.771]  Again, that's LibertyOnCall.org.
[02:24:05.885 --> 02:24:15.607]  By the way, there's a lot of positive things happening, but there are 7.5 billion people on the face of this globe.
[02:24:15.607 --> 02:24:16.787]  7.5 billion.
[02:24:16.787 --> 02:24:19.788]  And there are more weapons you can shake a stick at.
[02:24:19.788 --> 02:24:31.270]  And stuff that'll eat the paint off your house and leave you with a permanent orange afro to quote some funny movie I saw decades ago.
[02:24:31.270 --> 02:24:31.910]  And I look
[02:24:33.462 --> 02:24:39.945]  At all the things that are unfolding and happening, it's actually pretty darn positive.
[02:24:39.945 --> 02:24:41.905]  There's a lot of silver linings there.
[02:24:41.905 --> 02:24:55.431]  Boris Johnson, the liberal, trendy, loved mayor of London, was quoted, there's a video of it, it's up on Infowars.com's London Telegraph, says Americans would never accept
[02:24:57.586 --> 02:25:01.147]  EU restrictions, so why should we?
[02:25:01.147 --> 02:25:09.989]  It's now 90 plus percent of their laws, not 80 percent, are made by an unelected EU bureaucracy that's levying taxes on them, but it gets better.
[02:25:09.989 --> 02:25:14.970]  The EU bureaucrats exempt themselves from the tax.
[02:25:14.970 --> 02:25:26.513]  Barack Obama's plan to urge voters to remain in the European Union is a piece of outrage and exuberant hypocrisy, Boris Johnson writes.
[02:25:27.366 --> 02:25:28.186]  This is his article.
[02:25:28.186 --> 02:25:29.087]  I love America.
[02:25:29.087 --> 02:25:30.147]  I believe in the American Dream.
[02:25:30.147 --> 02:25:35.590]  Indeed, I hold that the story of the past hundred years has been very largely about how America rose to global greatness.
[02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:40.332]  How America has helped to preserve and expand democracy around the world.
[02:25:40.332 --> 02:25:47.096]  In two global conflicts and throughout the Cold War, the United States has fought for the founding ideals of the Republic.
[02:25:47.096 --> 02:25:51.798]  That government of the people, by the people, for the people, should not perish from the earth.
[02:25:51.798 --> 02:25:53.659]  I love him quoting Founding Fathers there.
[02:25:55.183 --> 02:26:00.348]  He wants to get out of the Euro, because he knows like 87% of the people do.
[02:26:00.348 --> 02:26:06.634]  The US government officials should believe that Britain must remain within the EU, a system which democracy is increasingly undermined.
[02:26:06.634 --> 02:26:09.897]  Yeah, they're banning free speech, they're arresting people.
[02:26:09.897 --> 02:26:13.640]  This guy's more of a real liberal, he's not perfect compared to like a Merkel.
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:15.522]  And then he goes in, you gotta read the article.
[02:26:19.409 --> 02:26:32.315]  Sometime in the next couple of months we are told that President Obama himself is going to arrive in this country like some deucex to pronounce on the matter.
[02:26:32.315 --> 02:26:40.359]  Air Force One will touch down, a lectern will, the presidential seal will be erected, the British people will be told to be good to themselves, do the right thing.
[02:26:41.411 --> 02:26:50.095]  We'll be informed by our most important ally that it's our interest to stay in the EU no matter how flawed we may feel the organization to be.
[02:26:50.095 --> 02:26:56.878]  Never mind the loss of sovereignty, never mind the expense and the bureaucracy and the uncontrolled immigration.
[02:26:56.878 --> 02:27:00.699]  This is a liberal talking like Nigel Farage now.
[02:27:00.699 --> 02:27:02.280]  Do you see what's happening?
[02:27:10.796 --> 02:27:16.099]  What I did is, and I've got another article with the mayor saying similar things.
[02:27:16.099 --> 02:27:17.619]  I think I'm mixing the two articles here together.
[02:27:17.619 --> 02:27:21.621]  The point is, you've got this article, then we've got Jean-Claude Van Damme.
[02:27:21.621 --> 02:27:24.263]  I mentioned this earlier, so I won't belabor it.
[02:27:24.263 --> 02:27:31.426]  Rockefeller and Rothschild families won't let Trump win.
[02:27:31.426 --> 02:27:37.909]  And then he goes on to talk about how we're run by a global elite, how globalism is meant to destroy the nation state, make us dependent.
[02:27:37.909 --> 02:27:39.310]  I mean, whether it's the London mayor,
[02:27:42.077 --> 02:27:48.920]  Or whether it's Jean-Claude Van Damme, people are getting it.
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:50.601]  People are understanding it.
[02:27:50.601 --> 02:27:52.282]  People are figuring it out.
[02:27:52.282 --> 02:28:04.247]  People are understanding, wait, foreign mega banks want 100 trillion in carbon taxes every 10 years to quote, fund a new global government, and they give themselves the money?
[02:28:04.247 --> 02:28:06.469]  Think about that.
[02:28:06.469 --> 02:28:09.370]  They give themselves the money, they're all exempt,
[02:28:12.776 --> 02:28:19.261]  And then they want us all to just accept this and shut up and go along with it.
[02:28:19.261 --> 02:28:27.848]  And now you're getting liberals and you're getting conservatives, you're getting people across the board just saying, no, we're not going to be part of this anymore.
[02:28:27.848 --> 02:28:30.711]  We're not going to go along with this anymore.
[02:28:30.711 --> 02:28:32.032]  We understand what's happening.
[02:28:32.984 --> 02:28:40.194]  And the moment you understand that we are run by multinational banks that own Big Pharma, the military industrial complex, they own it all.
[02:28:40.194 --> 02:28:43.819]  And that it's Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and other big banks that are multinational.
[02:28:44.465 --> 02:29:05.089]  That we're set up with foreign money, American in name only, that give money to open the borders, that give money for forced inoculation propaganda, that pay money to try to raise taxes with lobbyists on the people who are funding anti-gun initiatives, anti-family initiatives, federalization initiatives, launching new wars, spying on us.
[02:29:06.909 --> 02:29:20.258]  Those bureaucrats are the minions of the corporate chiefs who are the captains and the generals and the field marshals of less than 15 global mega-families who own the whole world.
[02:29:21.894 --> 02:29:28.036]  And you can read books by Kissinger's Kissinger group head, Rothkopf, Carol Quigley, all of them admitting this.
[02:29:28.036 --> 02:29:32.437]  Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote books on the 70s admitting it!
[02:29:32.437 --> 02:29:33.857]  And people ask, why do you write books admitting it?
[02:29:33.857 --> 02:29:36.198]  Because all the public's too dumb to ever read them.
[02:29:36.198 --> 02:29:38.539]  I need to be able to give this to my operatives so they understand.
[02:29:38.539 --> 02:29:41.339]  Like, sir, we fund fascists and communists, but never freedom.
[02:29:41.339 --> 02:29:41.739]  That's right.
[02:29:41.739 --> 02:29:42.820]  We never fund freedom.
[02:29:42.820 --> 02:29:44.700]  We only fund centralization.
[02:29:44.700 --> 02:29:46.341]  We want dictators.
[02:29:46.341 --> 02:29:46.941]  That's what they want.
[02:29:47.799 --> 02:29:51.722]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.722 --> 02:29:58.608]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.608 --> 02:30:06.355]  Last week we reported on one Pablo Serrano Vitorino, an illegal alien who has been charged with killing his neighbor and three other men with an AK-47.
[02:30:06.355 --> 02:30:12.920]  Now it has emerged that US immigration authorities had this man in custody twice last year and let him slip through their fingers.
[02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:15.142]  It also just came out that ICE revealed that a hundred
[02:30:15.883 --> 02:30:22.028]  124 illegal immigrants released from jail by the Obama administration since 2010 have subsequently been charged with murder.
[02:30:22.028 --> 02:30:32.698]  The report from the Center of Immigration Studies reads, the criminal aliens released by ICE in these years who had already been convicted of thousands of crimes are responsible for a significant crime spree in American communities, including 124 homicides.
[02:30:34.460 --> 02:30:38.564]  Inexplicably, ICE is choosing to release some criminal aliens multiple times.
[02:30:38.564 --> 02:30:43.309]  John Kasich in Thursday's CNN debate, who said he would enact his largest amnesty in U.S.
[02:30:43.309 --> 02:30:45.451]  history within his first hundred days in office.
[02:30:45.451 --> 02:30:53.298]  Here's a man barely hanging on to his political life, who wants to offer amnesty for people who came here illegally, and some of which have proven to be homicidal maniacs.
[02:30:53.298 --> 02:30:55.060]  Thank God we still have the Second Amendment.
[02:30:55.060 --> 02:30:57.803]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:30:58.403 --> 02:31:05.246]  Our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[02:31:05.246 --> 02:31:08.348]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[02:31:08.348 --> 02:31:14.510]  I needed to get my digestive system working correctly again, so I stumbled on the X2.
[02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:22.274]  When we look at a product like Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[02:31:22.274 --> 02:31:24.395]  I needed a detox basically.
[02:31:24.395 --> 02:31:24.815]  I started taking
[02:31:29.001 --> 02:31:32.645]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[02:31:32.645 --> 02:31:33.987]  What do you have to lose?
[02:31:33.987 --> 02:31:42.559]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[02:31:43.004 --> 02:31:46.868]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[02:31:46.868 --> 02:31:48.629]  I was like really more natural.
[02:31:48.629 --> 02:31:53.674]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.

[02:32:01.846 --> 02:32:02.747]  Tell us what happened.
[02:32:02.747 --> 02:32:07.511]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:32:07.511 --> 02:32:08.832]  Talk about the effects.
[02:32:08.832 --> 02:32:10.353]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:32:10.353 --> 02:32:12.275]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:32:12.275 --> 02:32:13.396]  I feel like I look better.
[02:32:13.396 --> 02:32:14.096]  I feel better.
[02:32:14.096 --> 02:32:15.518]  I feel sexier.

[02:33:08.792 --> 02:33:13.693]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:33:13.693 --> 02:33:17.314]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:17.314 --> 02:33:23.416]  Alright, we're going to Roger Stone, the consummate Trump insider, with huge newsmaking, key intel, in just a moment.
[02:33:23.416 --> 02:33:33.278]  But first off, just finishing up, you can go up and see the video, you can read the article, a transcript, London Telegraph, the mayor, the Liberal mayor, super popular, of London.
[02:33:35.131 --> 02:33:37.273]  Of course, he's come for leaving the EU.
[02:33:37.273 --> 02:33:38.474]  He calls it tyrannical.
[02:33:38.474 --> 02:33:40.316]  He says it's taking their rights.
[02:33:40.316 --> 02:33:41.717]  It's federalizing everything.
[02:33:41.717 --> 02:33:43.658]  The bureaucrats are tax-exempt.
[02:33:43.658 --> 02:33:46.161]  He calls it a tyranny.
[02:33:46.161 --> 02:33:50.044]  I mean, this sounds like it was written by Pat Buchanan or Alex Jones.
[02:33:50.044 --> 02:33:53.747]  Jean-Claude Van Damme comes out and says there's a world government robbing us.
[02:33:53.747 --> 02:33:54.728]  Trump's the answer.
[02:33:54.728 --> 02:33:55.729]  They hate sovereignty.
[02:33:57.389 --> 02:34:01.532]  He explains it's the new colonialism of the big megabanks above us.
[02:34:01.532 --> 02:34:03.734]  The world's getting it!
[02:34:03.734 --> 02:34:05.276]  The 100th monkey syndrome.
[02:34:05.276 --> 02:34:06.657]  It's been proven in major studies that...
[02:34:08.635 --> 02:34:10.836]  It was a primate research institute.
[02:34:10.836 --> 02:34:11.837]  It was more than 60 years ago.
[02:34:11.837 --> 02:34:13.157]  You can look it up.
[02:34:13.157 --> 02:34:18.000]  And a few miles away on another island, they had another research institute with the monkeys as well.
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:29.746]  And as soon as they would teach monkeys a task they'd never done before, suddenly, as if like through osmosis, the monkeys miles away, or 50 miles away, would suddenly learn how to do it as well.
[02:34:29.746 --> 02:34:31.207]  I mean, who knows what's really going on?
[02:34:31.207 --> 02:34:33.428]  There's a lot of, you know, weird stuff out there.
[02:34:34.346 --> 02:34:37.308]  And the point is, is that people are just getting it.
[02:34:37.308 --> 02:34:42.611]  And then it's a flashpoint, it's exciting, it's amazing.
[02:34:42.611 --> 02:34:49.296]  It's Kurt Russell one day, then it's the Mayor of London the next, then it's Jean-Claude Van Damme the next.
[02:34:49.296 --> 02:34:56.661]  Led by people like Ron Paul, like Nigel Farage, like yours truly Alex Jones, like Matt Drudge.
[02:34:56.661 --> 02:35:00.263]  What are all the establishment people going to do though when basically everybody wakes up?
[02:35:01.567 --> 02:35:02.207]  Hm?
[02:35:02.207 --> 02:35:03.888]  Start a war with North Korea?
[02:35:03.888 --> 02:35:08.529]  I wonder if the North Korean dictator who was raised in Switzerland's made a deal with somebody?
[02:35:08.529 --> 02:35:10.329]  A criminal organization?
[02:35:10.329 --> 02:35:11.330]  An intelligence agency?
[02:35:11.330 --> 02:35:12.030]  I don't know.
[02:35:12.030 --> 02:35:13.991]  But he's saying, I'm gonna nuke South Korea next week.
[02:35:13.991 --> 02:35:15.471]  I'm gonna blow up New York.
[02:35:15.471 --> 02:35:17.792]  Begging to be hit!
[02:35:17.792 --> 02:35:19.812]  Is he simply insane?
[02:35:19.812 --> 02:35:20.772]  This is so over the top.
[02:35:20.772 --> 02:35:23.453]  I'm gonna... He worked in a whole bunch of administrations.
[02:35:23.453 --> 02:35:25.514]  I'm gonna get his take on that as well.
[02:35:25.514 --> 02:35:26.494]  Roger Stone in a moment.
[02:35:26.494 --> 02:35:28.635]  Stonezone.com.
[02:35:28.635 --> 02:35:29.375]  Before I do that,
[02:35:30.526 --> 02:35:35.067]  We have a massive denial of service attack on our classic InfoWars store.
[02:35:35.067 --> 02:35:37.788]  It's completely shut it down.
[02:35:37.788 --> 02:35:42.850]  You can go to InfoWarsStore.com, that's our new high-tech store, and you're like, oh, it's here, it's working fine.
[02:35:42.850 --> 02:35:49.632]  The old store that actually gets more traffic than the new because it's linked all over Google, the store.InfoWars.com, it is shut down right now.
[02:35:52.506 --> 02:35:57.970]  It's very exciting to see people responding to that attack and going to the new store and buying the high-quality products.
[02:35:57.970 --> 02:36:00.011]  We have 30 to 40% off only today.
[02:36:00.011 --> 02:36:02.413]  A flash sale on super high quality.
[02:36:02.413 --> 02:36:04.254]  InfoWare selects horrible foods.
[02:36:04.254 --> 02:36:08.457]  We have SuperMill Vitality, AnthroPlex back in stock.
[02:36:08.457 --> 02:36:10.258]  Get a bottle of BrainForce for yourself.
[02:36:10.258 --> 02:36:12.159]  The liver cleanse is back in stock.
[02:36:12.159 --> 02:36:13.400]  My mom hadn't done it yet.
[02:36:13.400 --> 02:36:15.041]  She's going to start this weekend.
[02:36:15.041 --> 02:36:22.306]  Do a six-day cleanse with the oxy powder and of course the liver shield and more to flush out the gallbladder and more.
[02:36:22.686 --> 02:36:25.988]  Folks, buy the products, try them, they'll blow you away.
[02:36:25.988 --> 02:36:34.713]  We went into the big Bloomberg article about gut flora and not having gut flora letting your body develop cancer and that they think most cancer now, even U.S.
[02:36:34.713 --> 02:36:37.715]  funded major agencies have come out in a huge article.
[02:36:37.715 --> 02:36:40.576]  I spent 30 minutes on it, so I won't go any further.
[02:36:40.576 --> 02:36:43.918]  What do you think, and it links to the thyroid controlling the gut.
[02:36:43.918 --> 02:36:49.001]  Again, you put fluoride in the thyroid, it can't operate properly, you basically start dying.
[02:36:49.001 --> 02:36:50.022]  It just shuts your body off.
[02:36:50.382 --> 02:36:51.904]  That's where X2 comes in.
[02:36:51.904 --> 02:36:53.928]  The purest iodine you're going to find anywhere.
[02:36:53.928 --> 02:36:54.729]  Unbound.

[02:36:59.296 --> 02:37:02.040]  Hillary for President t-shirts and more.
[02:37:02.040 --> 02:37:04.424]  Now, going to our guest.
[02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:16.969]  Roger Stone of StoneZone.com, if you just joined us, 40 years Trump's friend, former head of his campaign, out on his own so he can really take the gloves off in the last eight months.
[02:37:16.969 --> 02:37:21.733]  You see him all over television, all over History Channel, all over CNN, all over Fox.
[02:37:21.733 --> 02:37:28.139]  But he was banned from CNN two weeks ago, and now Ron Paul's come out and said Loretta Lynch and the government wore on free speech.
[02:37:28.139 --> 02:37:32.984]  We're talking about arresting people that deny man-made global climate change.
[02:37:34.144 --> 02:37:46.991]  And they're talking about, in the Washington Post, arresting Donald Trump, or suing him, saying that his rhetoric is causing MoveOn.org and Hillary to come in and attack Donald Trump supporters and Trump himself.
[02:37:46.991 --> 02:37:50.273]  Talk about upside-down, bizarro world.
[02:37:50.273 --> 02:37:55.076]  Saturday he called us, we broke the news, it went viral.
[02:37:55.076 --> 02:38:00.799]  The signs are printed up, they say they're Bernie supporters, but you know who runs Chicago, the Clinton crime machine with Rahm Emanuel.
[02:38:01.656 --> 02:38:06.104]  And then they came out after Stone was on our show and MoveOn.org said we take responsibility.
[02:38:06.104 --> 02:38:07.907]  Soros does.
[02:38:07.907 --> 02:38:09.991]  Well, they support Hillary.
[02:38:09.991 --> 02:38:12.716]  But Trump still is just saying, hey, Bernie, watch it.
[02:38:13.595 --> 02:38:17.498]  And I guess he thinks the public's dumbed down and thinks it was Bernie, or maybe he didn't listen to Stone.
[02:38:17.498 --> 02:38:19.339]  We'll find out right now, but for me this is a big deal.
[02:38:19.339 --> 02:38:23.942]  We'll spend a few minutes on that, recapping and getting new intel, and then the big news.
[02:38:23.942 --> 02:38:27.704]  Several of his articles I have here from the Daily Caller and others.
[02:38:27.704 --> 02:38:33.248]  Sex scandals looming for Cruz, who's the real Heidi Cruz, and more.
[02:38:33.248 --> 02:38:35.209]  So Roger Stone joins us.
[02:38:35.209 --> 02:38:37.251]  Roger Stone, thank you so much for coming back on.
[02:38:38.194 --> 02:38:39.815]  Alex, great to be with you.
[02:38:39.815 --> 02:38:42.395]  And your Skype's blipping out a little bit, but now you're back with us.
[02:38:42.395 --> 02:38:43.496]  Wow, you've got the floor.
[02:38:43.496 --> 02:38:46.297]  Where should we start?
[02:38:46.297 --> 02:38:47.197]  Any place you like.
[02:38:47.197 --> 02:38:49.898]  I think it's amazing, and I have to lead off with this.
[02:38:49.898 --> 02:38:58.141]  We now have a Facebook video of the man who attacked Donald Trump the other day in a rally.
[02:38:58.141 --> 02:39:04.763]  And the opening of this video, he is brandishing an Uzi and declaring his terrorist connections.
[02:39:05.216 --> 02:39:08.138]  The mainstream media is already editing that part out.
[02:39:08.138 --> 02:39:14.282]  They're going to show us this brave demonstrator who's speaking out against Trump.
[02:39:14.282 --> 02:39:25.310]  Why this guy has even been released after lunging by security and the Secret Service, why he has not been arrested and hasn't been charged, is amazing to me.
[02:39:25.310 --> 02:39:27.591]  As I said on this very show...
[02:39:32.384 --> 02:39:38.185]  Roger, your Skype's breaking up real bad.
[02:39:38.185 --> 02:39:41.326]  We may have to keep the video, but go to cell phone or landline in a moment.
[02:39:41.326 --> 02:39:48.448]  But getting back to that, this is a guy trying to run up on stage saying he wanted to kill Trump on his social media accounts.
[02:39:48.448 --> 02:39:50.489]  Now you're saying, I haven't seen this yet, please direct us to it.
[02:39:50.489 --> 02:39:56.050]  I'm sure it's on Drudge, if I've missed it, brandishing a gun and he's not in trouble.
[02:39:56.050 --> 02:39:57.751]  Instead, he's on CNN as a hero.
[02:39:58.496 --> 02:40:03.821]  Yes, it's absolutely amazing, and it's part of what we say.
[02:40:03.821 --> 02:40:08.104]  Look, the entire Chicago administration is funded by three people.
[02:40:08.104 --> 02:40:18.073]  George Soros, David Brock, which is really Soros money, and the idiot son who is the heir to the progressive insurance fortune, Jonathan Lewis.
[02:40:18.733 --> 02:40:20.154]  Again, this is important.
[02:40:20.154 --> 02:40:22.355]  These are not Sanders supporters.
[02:40:22.355 --> 02:40:40.767]  The idea here is to drive a wedge between Trump and those blue-collar Sanders supporters who are motivated by their opposition to the international trade agreements, like NAFTA, that have destroyed the job market in much of the United States, particularly the Midwest and the Northeast.
[02:40:41.865 --> 02:40:49.310]  The Democratic chieftains, the Clinton cabal, can see these votes moving to Trump in a general election.
[02:40:49.310 --> 02:41:06.060]  So the effort here is to alienate them from Trump by branding Trump as a racist, at the same time fishing for an overreaction from Trump supporters so they can then point at Trump and say, oh you see, he's inciting violence.
[02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:08.521]  He's the one inciting violence.
[02:41:08.521 --> 02:41:09.501]  You're right.
[02:41:09.501 --> 02:41:10.922]  It's cock-a-head.
[02:41:10.922 --> 02:41:11.842]  It's backwards.
[02:41:11.842 --> 02:41:15.584]  But where are Marco Rubio and particularly Ted Cruz?
[02:41:15.584 --> 02:41:17.645]  Sure, I'm going to cut you off right there, Roger.
[02:41:17.645 --> 02:41:19.206]  Your Skype's degraded too much.
[02:41:19.206 --> 02:41:19.786]  Keep the video.
[02:41:19.786 --> 02:41:24.568]  We're going to call your cell phone right now, and then we'll have cell phone for audio, but have you video that way.
[02:41:24.568 --> 02:41:27.569]  Roger Stone, stonezone.com is our guest.
[02:41:27.569 --> 02:41:29.670]  We're seeing the veil be pulled back.
[02:41:29.670 --> 02:41:30.691]  Unprecedented
[02:41:31.511 --> 02:41:37.357]  Democrats, Republicans, the Chinese Communists, just everybody coming out saying you can't have Donald Trump.
[02:41:37.357 --> 02:41:42.261]  And then all these people from the left, you name it, foreigners, saying we should support Trump.
[02:41:42.261 --> 02:41:43.983]  He just wants sovereignty.
[02:41:43.983 --> 02:41:47.206]  But they want to make that idea so outrageous, so crazy.
[02:41:48.413 --> 02:41:52.616]  That they can demonize anyone that even raises the point.
[02:41:52.616 --> 02:41:57.440]  They want us bullied into total and complete submissions.
[02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:02.363]  We're going to start back over as soon as we get good audio with Mr. Stone.
[02:42:02.363 --> 02:42:08.488]  Normally he has pretty good audio and video, but today that is not happening via the miracle of Skype and technology.
[02:42:08.488 --> 02:42:12.471]  More evil things that capitalism helped innovate for us.
[02:42:13.311 --> 02:42:21.797]  I love watching the socialist and communist rallies as they wear designer clothes, pull up a new Jaguars and wave their $400 smartphones in the air.
[02:42:21.797 --> 02:42:26.840]  And then you talk to them and their parents are usually executives at companies.
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:28.041]  But their parents are very proud of them.
[02:42:28.041 --> 02:42:30.242]  Yes, you will be the rulers.
[02:42:30.242 --> 02:42:33.985]  Because they know we're going into the communitarian age now.
[02:42:33.985 --> 02:42:36.766]  So it is just unspeakable what's unfolding.
[02:42:36.766 --> 02:42:37.367]  Do we have Stoneback?
[02:42:38.334 --> 02:42:40.294]  All right, let's start over with Roger Stone.
[02:42:40.294 --> 02:42:48.996]  Roger, getting back into this, you know, the Washington Post, we can pull the article up, they ask, should Donald Trump be held responsible for violence at his rallies?
[02:42:48.996 --> 02:42:52.757]  When MoveOn is admittedly doing this, but he keeps saying Bernie, Bernie.
[02:42:52.757 --> 02:42:54.258]  I know they had Bernie signs.
[02:42:54.258 --> 02:42:57.658]  I know that, you know, that's easy to say, but you had a guy in the meeting.
[02:42:57.658 --> 02:42:59.659]  This is David Brock.
[02:42:59.659 --> 02:43:00.559]  How big a deal is that?
[02:43:02.324 --> 02:43:12.210]  I think Trump has more recently amended his Twitter feed that he's correctly pointing this at the Clinton machine because that's where the blame belongs.
[02:43:12.210 --> 02:43:24.498]  As I said earlier, the three major funders of the attack by protesters in Chicago are Soros and then David Brock, although that's really Soros' money, so move on.
[02:43:25.479 --> 02:43:28.360]  Media matters for money, as I like to call it.
[02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:42.226]  And then finally, Jonathan Lewis, the mysterious and reclusive heir to the progressive insurance fortune, Peter Lewis, his late father, funding all kinds of left-wing schemes.
[02:43:42.226 --> 02:43:48.148]  These are the ringleaders and the financiers of this false flag attack on Trump.
[02:43:48.780 --> 02:43:51.042]  And their goal is twofold.
[02:43:51.042 --> 02:44:05.312]  One, to split off those economic voters who are currently for Bernie, who could very well end up with Trump because the international trade deals have put these folks out of work, have destroyed their livelihood, and they've figured it out.
[02:44:05.792 --> 02:44:08.133]  Bill and Hillary pushed NAFTA.
[02:44:08.133 --> 02:44:12.995]  Now suddenly that she's running for president, she says, oh she's changed her mind about NAFTA.
[02:44:12.995 --> 02:44:19.278]  Well, she won't change her mind about TPP or any of the upcoming international globalist trade deals.
[02:44:19.278 --> 02:44:21.559]  She cannot be trusted on this issue.
[02:44:21.559 --> 02:44:29.742]  And then secondarily, they want to brand Trump, as I wrote for Breitbart, as a bigot, a racist, prone to violence.
[02:44:29.742 --> 02:44:33.944]  This is an effort to alienate those blue-collar voters that we're talking about.
[02:44:34.522 --> 02:44:39.523]  We're for Bernie today, which could end up being for Trump.
[02:44:39.523 --> 02:44:43.184]  How is the overall fight going, Roger, right now?
[02:44:43.184 --> 02:44:45.784]  Clearly, they're shaving votes around the state.
[02:44:45.784 --> 02:44:51.385]  The state of Texas now admits they can't certify the election, but I'm sure the RNC will just do it at the convention.
[02:44:51.385 --> 02:44:52.825]  They're admitting fraud in Ohio.
[02:44:52.825 --> 02:45:02.627]  I mean, it's all coming out that there's fraud going on to shave points so that Trump doesn't get a clear majority, and so they can sell the idea of a broker convention that you first warned of.
[02:45:03.919 --> 02:45:08.642]  Yeah, it's interesting how much of this stuff was first revealed on Infowars.com.
[02:45:08.642 --> 02:45:22.992]  The Texas stealing, the Kansas voter fraud, the Maine voter fraud, the irregularities in Hawaii, in Ohio, and trust me, you're going to have problems tomorrow in Florida.
[02:45:22.992 --> 02:45:32.678]  The Trump ballot security project I'm working with is preparing a lawsuit to overturn the results of the Ohio primary in the event that John Kasich wins.
[02:45:33.246 --> 02:45:42.417]  And we have a very strong lawsuit based on the format of the ballot, which we believe was designed specifically to disadvantage Trump.
[02:45:42.417 --> 02:45:50.847]  There's a high probability that we would challenge the seating of the text delegates because they were elected through fraud.
[02:45:51.487 --> 02:45:57.851]  And that challenge could be brought in the Credentials Committee, if necessary, to the full convention.
[02:45:57.851 --> 02:46:08.716]  If you want to read more on this, or if you want to help, or particularly if you know of voter fraud in Texas, particularly, go to StopTheSteal.org.
[02:46:08.716 --> 02:46:17.821]  One of our problems, Alex, is people call us and they tell us the specifics of their vote and how they feel defrauded, but they don't leave us their name and phone number.
[02:46:18.226 --> 02:46:25.472]  We must have your name and phone number or email address so we can get back to you and document what happened.
[02:46:25.472 --> 02:46:39.344]  So I call out to any of those, anyone in the country who believes they have been defrauded or there were voting irregularities against Trump, please contact us at stopthesteal.org, but leave your name so we can follow up.
[02:46:40.560 --> 02:46:42.061]  How is Donald feeling right now?
[02:46:42.061 --> 02:46:43.422]  He seems super energized.
[02:46:43.422 --> 02:46:54.651]  I love the fact that when he was in Ohio and that guy rushed the stage that says he wants to kill Trump so he's a loving hero, such a man, that Trump didn't run from him or jump on the ground like most presidential candidates would.
[02:46:54.651 --> 02:46:59.675]  When the Secret Service tried to shield him and jump on him, he pushed him out of the way like he wanted to fight the guy.
[02:46:59.675 --> 02:47:03.098]  I would absolutely love to have one of those pieces of trash try to climb up on the stage.
[02:47:03.098 --> 02:47:04.199]  I'd just kick him right in the nose.
[02:47:05.182 --> 02:47:06.703]  Yeah, no, Trump is a tough guy.
[02:47:06.703 --> 02:47:07.603]  He's courageous.
[02:47:07.603 --> 02:47:09.304]  He knows he's taking his life in his hands.
[02:47:09.304 --> 02:47:16.767]  You can now see, which I said on this show again, that he has been forced to wear a bulletproof vest.
[02:47:16.767 --> 02:47:21.189]  Obviously, he knows that a headshot is a whole different issue.
[02:47:21.189 --> 02:47:27.692]  There's no question, to save his country, he's taking these enormous personal risks, but he is pumped up.
[02:47:27.692 --> 02:47:28.512]  He's energized.
[02:47:29.139 --> 02:47:34.381]  And he realizes more and more that this is a united globalist phenomena.
[02:47:34.381 --> 02:47:40.864]  You'll notice that Cruz and Rubio and Kasich, they sided with the Chicago protesters.
[02:47:40.864 --> 02:47:45.306]  They attacked Trump for inciting violence by speaking the blunt truth.
[02:47:45.306 --> 02:47:46.767]  So we know where they stand.
[02:47:46.767 --> 02:47:52.210]  Instead of defending free speech and the First Amendment, they piled on with sorrows.
[02:47:52.210 --> 02:47:54.931]  That's because at the end of the day, they too are globalists.
[02:47:55.484 --> 02:48:01.030]  I know Ted Cruz does a great job of sounding like a constitutional conservative, but look at his background.
[02:48:01.030 --> 02:48:01.771]  He's a Bush man!
[02:48:02.483 --> 02:48:04.925]  He and his wife are both Bush Quisling.
[02:48:04.925 --> 02:48:06.867]  Exactly, and Trump does whatever he wants.
[02:48:06.867 --> 02:48:08.128]  He's been his own guy.
[02:48:08.128 --> 02:48:11.590]  He's manipulated the political system legally, but he's not been part of it.
[02:48:11.590 --> 02:48:13.352]  He doesn't go to the CFR meetings.
[02:48:13.352 --> 02:48:15.313]  He doesn't hang out with all these people.
[02:48:15.313 --> 02:48:18.256]  I didn't like him saying, hey, I met with Haas, but I mean, I get it.
[02:48:18.256 --> 02:48:20.538]  If Haas wanted to meet with me, I'd meet with him as well.
[02:48:20.538 --> 02:48:22.039]  It doesn't mean I'm going to join him.
[02:48:22.039 --> 02:48:24.641]  But Cruz comes out of their loins.
[02:48:24.641 --> 02:48:26.042]  His wife comes out of the bushes.
[02:48:26.042 --> 02:48:26.743]  He does.
[02:48:26.743 --> 02:48:28.264]  Goldman Sachs, top of the pyramid.
[02:48:28.564 --> 02:48:30.066]  Your article's on Daily Caller.
[02:48:30.066 --> 02:48:33.949]  Who is the real Heidi Nelson Cruz?
[02:48:33.949 --> 02:48:35.351]  And it's a very, very important article.
[02:48:35.351 --> 02:48:36.172]  What about this other one?
[02:48:36.172 --> 02:48:37.953]  Breaking.
[02:48:37.953 --> 02:48:40.316]  A Ted Cruz sex scandal appears to be looming.
[02:48:40.316 --> 02:48:42.037]  What's the word on that?
[02:48:42.037 --> 02:48:45.321]  Well, this is out there and it remains to be seen.
[02:48:45.321 --> 02:48:49.905]  There are allegations about Senator Cruz and various women.
[02:48:49.905 --> 02:48:51.087]  None of this has been proven.
[02:48:51.087 --> 02:48:52.368]  I want to say that for the record.
[02:48:53.101 --> 02:48:56.864]  Uh, but there are a number of major, major news outlets.
[02:48:56.864 --> 02:49:01.607]  We're talking about mainstream media outlets chasing these rumors.
[02:49:01.607 --> 02:49:05.629]  Now, it'll be interesting to see whether any of this makes print.
[02:49:05.629 --> 02:49:11.413]  I'm not going to malign the senator with specifics because at this point they are just allegations.
[02:49:12.212 --> 02:49:16.333]  It is part and parcel of the Washington cabal, though.
[02:49:16.333 --> 02:49:23.014]  These senators begin to believe that they have some kind of inoculation.
[02:49:23.014 --> 02:49:28.475]  They believe they're above the law, the power, the money, the women, the sex.
[02:49:28.475 --> 02:49:31.675]  It all comes as part of the package.
[02:49:31.675 --> 02:49:40.837]  So it remains to be seen whether this story breaks through to the mainstream media, but I have talked to at least three newspapers who contacted me
[02:49:41.740 --> 02:49:44.867]  Ask me what I knew about some of the details.
[02:49:44.867 --> 02:49:45.668]  Let's leave it there.
[02:49:45.668 --> 02:49:47.492]  So the media is digging around.
[02:49:47.492 --> 02:49:48.454]  Here's what I have to say about it.
[02:49:50.358 --> 02:49:54.460]  I like it when a family man's not out running around with his wife and kids, okay?
[02:49:54.460 --> 02:50:06.105]  But they better not make an issue out of this or Trump having divorces or Trump having girlfriends or anybody when Hillary has an entourage of women she's known to sleep with and stay in the same hotel.
[02:50:06.105 --> 02:50:09.686]  So if they don't go after her cheating on her husband, I don't want to hear it.
[02:50:09.686 --> 02:50:13.268]  But in this upside down world, you watch, the crime is that
[02:50:13.948 --> 02:50:17.090]  Ted Cruz wasn't in bed with little kids.
[02:50:17.090 --> 02:50:20.991]  Now, if that was the case, they'd make him, you know, Speaker of the House or something like that.
[02:50:20.991 --> 02:50:24.133]  Or, you know, give him something like Hastert's job.
[02:50:24.133 --> 02:50:27.975]  I mean, that's where I'm going with this, Stone.
[02:50:27.975 --> 02:50:28.975]  Well, we shall see.
[02:50:28.975 --> 02:50:30.876]  It remains to be seen whether they broke.
[02:50:30.876 --> 02:50:34.418]  At this point, I am convinced that the Republican establishment will hold their nose.
[02:50:35.171 --> 02:50:35.531]  Stay there.
[02:50:35.531 --> 02:50:36.352]  Do one more segment.
[02:50:36.352 --> 02:50:37.213]  I want to talk about that.
[02:50:37.213 --> 02:50:39.735]  Talk about where Trump is in the campaign.
[02:50:39.735 --> 02:50:41.296]  How he's doing from your expert view.
[02:50:58.621 --> 02:51:02.962]  Serious investors and traders want to make 81% return in 60 seconds?

[02:51:59.289 --> 02:52:00.891]  Hi, my name is Nick Lupo.
[02:52:00.891 --> 02:52:04.154]  One World Way has been by far the best protein that I've ever had.
[02:52:04.154 --> 02:52:05.775]  I take it three times a day.
[02:52:05.775 --> 02:52:11.280]  Once in the morning as soon as I wake, once for a pre-workout snack, and once for a post-workout recovery drink.
[02:52:11.280 --> 02:52:14.824]  It has helped me transform and sculpt my body into what I have now.
[02:52:14.824 --> 02:52:18.187]  I began taking the product about two years ago, and boy let me tell you,
[02:52:18.447 --> 02:52:19.988]  I'm in the best shape of my life.
[02:52:19.988 --> 02:52:23.691]  I've seen major muscle mass gains and have 0% body fat.
[02:52:23.691 --> 02:52:28.135]  I have had people in my gym ask if I compete in bodybuilding because of how lean and muscular I am.
[02:52:28.135 --> 02:52:34.600]  I used to suffer from everyday aches and pains from hard manual labor my whole life and arthritis that runs through my family.
[02:52:34.600 --> 02:52:38.884]  But One World Way has helped me take that everyday pain from a 10 to a 3.
[02:52:38.884 --> 02:52:41.746]  Some days I feel no pain at all, just full of life and energy.
[02:52:41.746 --> 02:52:44.829]  It has also helped my skin look younger and healthier.
[02:52:44.829 --> 02:52:47.391]  Thank you, Synergistic Nutrition, for One World Way.

[02:54:12.671 --> 02:54:18.816]  Paul Joseph Watson from the UK is going to be blitzing through masses of news in the fourth hour.
[02:54:18.816 --> 02:54:21.919]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:54:21.919 --> 02:54:24.241]  Roger Stone is our guest.
[02:54:24.241 --> 02:54:26.563]  Look at this headline on DrugsReport.com.
[02:54:26.563 --> 02:54:30.546]  GOP Senator Panicked Establishment Losing Control.
[02:54:30.546 --> 02:54:32.968]  Look at that big old headline.
[02:54:32.968 --> 02:54:35.230]  And that's exactly what's going on.
[02:54:35.230 --> 02:54:37.132]  The GOP establishment is so arrogant,
[02:54:38.663 --> 02:54:52.388]  People like Mitch McConnell will get up on television and they will openly say that they'll just give it to Hillary.
[02:54:52.388 --> 02:54:57.531]  So they'll steal your votes, block him at the convention, and then give it to Hillary.
[02:54:57.531 --> 02:55:00.652]  They'll openly rob you.
[02:55:00.652 --> 02:55:02.452]  People say, oh, because Trump might be dangerous.
[02:55:02.452 --> 02:55:03.493]  We know they're dangerous.
[02:55:03.493 --> 02:55:05.974]  So there's a major disconnect by these people.
[02:55:09.707 --> 02:55:14.129]  Meanwhile, Kasich's pro-Obama trade, a death warrant for Ohio manufacturing.
[02:55:14.129 --> 02:55:21.193]  You got cut off by the break, Roger, in the four minutes we have left now, or five minutes.
[02:55:21.193 --> 02:55:23.694]  How is Trump really doing in the campaign?
[02:55:23.694 --> 02:55:25.455]  What do we need to watch most closely?
[02:55:25.455 --> 02:55:29.397]  And what are other tidbits that we should be getting into?
[02:55:29.397 --> 02:55:36.060]  Well, Alex, I really think the attack on Trump and his campaign in Chicago has backfired very badly.
[02:55:36.829 --> 02:55:59.604]  Just as the establishment wing of the party was not able to stop the inexorable march of Barry Fuller in 1964, we're in an analogous situation where the attacks of the Pope, of the Chinese government, of Mexican former president Vincente Fox, of Mitt Romney, of the K Street lobbyists, this is all backfiring.
[02:55:59.604 --> 02:56:02.326]  This is fueling Trump's drive for the nomination.
[02:56:02.947 --> 02:56:06.348]  I would predict to you right now he wins Florida by double digits.
[02:56:06.348 --> 02:56:10.028]  Most of the polls show him in single digits.
[02:56:10.028 --> 02:56:22.591]  25% of those who have already cast absentee ballots did not vote two years ago, and 15% did not vote four years ago at all.
[02:56:22.591 --> 02:56:29.072]  So this tells you, again, definitively that Trump is bringing thousands of new people to the process.
[02:56:29.072 --> 02:56:31.653]  Secondarily, most of these polls that you see
[02:56:32.634 --> 02:56:38.178]  And Trump's bringing in people that have not ever voted or haven't voted in 20 years.
[02:56:38.178 --> 02:56:38.778]  That's true.
[02:56:38.778 --> 02:56:41.239]  And so they're telling us he's going to lose, so they try to steal it.
[02:56:41.239 --> 02:56:41.920]  We might believe it.
[02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:44.201]  But if you have a landslide, it's hard to steal.
[02:57:02.142 --> 02:57:13.090]  Well, and also, it's just a mythological mistake based on the fact that they misunderstand who is voting, which is why I believe he could eke out a win in Ohio.
[02:57:13.090 --> 02:57:18.755]  I know, personally, because I've talked to a couple of registrars and voters out there who are friends.
[02:57:18.755 --> 02:57:19.115]  Sure.
[02:57:19.115 --> 02:57:26.441]  They are having real problems with Democrats crowding the polls and filling out the paperwork to switch parties and vote in the Republican primary.
[02:57:26.441 --> 02:57:27.361]  Sure, and the polls show that.
[02:57:27.361 --> 02:57:28.642]  Let me ask you this question then.
[02:57:29.783 --> 02:57:32.664]  In closing, what other attacks should we look for?
[02:57:32.664 --> 02:57:37.926]  Are they going to try to wind up some loon, having the New York Times, having Saturday Night Live say kill him?
[02:57:37.926 --> 02:57:42.687]  Are they just trying to hype it, hoping some lone nut kills Trump?
[02:57:42.687 --> 02:57:44.848]  That could be it, but I'll tell you what is definitely coming.
[02:57:44.848 --> 02:57:57.872]  There will be an attack on Trump that will say that as a developer and builder, he regularly bought concrete from a company controlled by the mob and fat Tony Salerno, a gangster.
[02:57:58.584 --> 02:58:00.325]  Here's what they won't tell you.
[02:58:00.325 --> 02:58:03.866]  The city of New York also bought concrete from them.
[02:58:03.866 --> 02:58:05.747]  So did the state of New York.
[02:58:05.747 --> 02:58:12.210]  So did every other major developer in New York because they had a New York business license.
[02:58:12.210 --> 02:58:14.131]  See, they don't tell you that part.
[02:58:14.131 --> 02:58:16.752]  And why did everybody buy concrete from this one company?
[02:58:16.752 --> 02:58:18.713]  Because they were union friendly.
[02:58:19.961 --> 02:58:27.487]  So, Trump has done nothing wrong, but the insinuation will be, oh, he's mobbed up, he bought concrete from this one company.
[02:58:27.487 --> 02:58:30.470]  They're not going to tell you that so did the state of New York, so did the state of New York.
[02:58:30.470 --> 02:58:32.071]  I'll tell you what, Stone, we're back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:32.071 --> 02:58:37.996]  Do five more minutes with me, because I've got a couple more questions, and PJR, Paul Joseph Watson, is coming up.
[02:58:37.996 --> 02:58:38.837]  Stay with us.
[02:58:38.837 --> 02:58:39.938]  That's a joke.
[02:58:39.938 --> 02:58:42.460]  I tease and call him that sometimes.
[02:58:42.460 --> 02:58:43.160]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:58:43.160 --> 02:58:45.322]  Fourth hour, straight ahead, InfoWars.com.
[02:58:45.322 --> 02:58:45.903]  Where's last show?
[02:58:48.188 --> 02:58:49.009]  Hey, everyone!
[02:58:49.009 --> 02:58:51.310]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[02:58:51.310 --> 02:58:55.153]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:58:55.153 --> 02:58:57.234]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:58:57.234 --> 02:59:07.501]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:59:07.501 --> 02:59:13.485]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:59:13.945 --> 02:59:34.712]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work, you need to check out InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:59:34.712 --> 02:59:36.673]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition.
[02:59:36.673 --> 02:59:37.053]  Head over to
[02:59:37.273 --> 02:59:39.116]  Infowarsteam.com.
[02:59:39.116 --> 02:59:40.959]  Your body will be very grateful.
[02:59:40.959 --> 02:59:44.003]  On the web at Infowarsteam.com.
[02:59:44.003 --> 02:59:50.273]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[02:59:50.273 --> 02:59:52.897]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.013 --> 03:00:07.658]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:07.658 --> 03:00:10.640]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:21.471 --> 03:00:22.551]  The system's desperate.
[03:00:22.551 --> 03:00:28.273]  Again, the Washington Post yesterday said, hey, should we fine or fee or sue or arrest Donald Trump?
[03:00:28.273 --> 03:00:31.914]  It's his fault, you know, that he claims we should have some sovereignty.
[03:00:31.914 --> 03:00:34.135]  It's his fault he's causing all the problems.
[03:00:34.135 --> 03:00:41.097]  Meanwhile, ICE has released 123 illegals that committed 125 murders.
[03:00:41.097 --> 03:00:42.658]  That story's from the Examiner.
[03:00:42.658 --> 03:00:44.498]  That's just one story.
[03:00:44.498 --> 03:00:46.339]  This is totally crazy.
[03:00:46.339 --> 03:00:49.620]  Let me shift gears into this subject in closing, Roger Stone.
[03:00:50.885 --> 03:00:57.913]  We bring up the mainstream media investigating whether Ted Cruz has got girlfriends on the side.
[03:00:57.913 --> 03:01:01.717]  And what I said here is, I'm not giving that a pass.
[03:01:01.717 --> 03:01:10.606]  What I am saying is, how can the Clintons' bill be raping women, Hillary covering it up, Hillary with all these women around her.
[03:01:11.533 --> 03:01:16.216]  You know, stay in her hotel room, you know, she's known, uh, bisexual, probably just a lesbian, whatever.
[03:01:16.216 --> 03:01:18.178]  I don't even get into that issue.
[03:01:18.178 --> 03:01:28.405]  But, why being a protected group, sexually, like a lesbian, is she allowed to then shoot on her husband, but if Ted Cruz is shooting on his wife, then it's bad.
[03:01:28.405 --> 03:01:32.848]  She, I mean, it's like, crazy, how the left gets passes on everything.
[03:01:33.748 --> 03:01:38.250]  Drudge is always pointing out who her girlfriends are, and the media acts like he's making that up.
[03:01:38.250 --> 03:01:42.192]  It's known that she's seen more tail than a toilet seat.
[03:01:42.192 --> 03:01:47.834]  So I'm asking you right now, where do you think all this shakes out in the election, them coming after Trump?
[03:01:47.834 --> 03:01:52.096]  I know he's owned it, getting off his jet with a bunch of beautiful women from the pageant.
[03:01:52.096 --> 03:01:54.957]  I know he's in between divorces, had girlfriends.
[03:01:54.957 --> 03:01:56.258]  Big deal.
[03:01:56.258 --> 03:01:57.138]  The guy doesn't hide it.
[03:01:59.117 --> 03:02:05.081]  In three minutes, closing remarks, I'm concerned about that down the road.
[03:02:05.081 --> 03:02:08.284]  Yeah, you know, I think that there are greater concerns.
[03:02:08.284 --> 03:02:11.427]  I have a greater concern for his personal safety, to be honest with you.
[03:02:11.427 --> 03:02:13.248]  Because this is a non-starter.
[03:02:13.248 --> 03:02:20.794]  There's no question whatsoever that Trump had numerous beautiful and glamorous girlfriends in between his marriages.
[03:02:20.794 --> 03:02:24.798]  But the issue here is not marital infidelity, and it's not adultery.
[03:02:24.798 --> 03:02:27.300]  In the case of the Clintons, it's something much darker.
[03:02:27.944 --> 03:02:28.824]  It's rape.
[03:02:28.824 --> 03:02:34.127]  It's sexual assault, in which Hillary has been an accessory in all of those sex crimes.
[03:02:34.127 --> 03:02:46.213]  Because as you know, and as I establish in my book, The Clinton War on Women, Hillary is the one who runs the campaign to intimidate and bully and terrorize these women out of testifying or out of going public.
[03:02:46.213 --> 03:02:47.433]  Sure, let me ask you this.
[03:02:47.433 --> 03:02:48.233]  Trump is winning.
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:50.600]  Yeah, I don't think we have a choice.
[03:02:50.600 --> 03:02:51.400]  He's not going to hide.
[03:02:51.400 --> 03:02:52.081]  It's not his nature.
[03:02:52.081 --> 03:02:53.241]  And he's not going to cower.
[03:02:53.241 --> 03:02:54.261]  It's just not his nature.
[03:02:54.261 --> 03:02:55.961]  So, you know, we pray for him every day.
[03:02:55.961 --> 03:02:57.722]  We pray for his safety because this is the last
[03:03:18.467 --> 03:03:20.428]  That's the best hope for Western civilization.
[03:03:20.428 --> 03:03:25.131]  This is the last best hope for the sovereignty of the American people.
[03:03:25.131 --> 03:03:25.992]  Is Trump perfect?
[03:03:25.992 --> 03:03:26.913]  No, he's not perfect.
[03:03:26.913 --> 03:03:27.713]  Well, I'll say this.
[03:03:27.713 --> 03:03:32.937]  It makes me like him even more that he went at the attacker and that he's not a coward.
[03:03:32.937 --> 03:03:35.999]  And I know full well the Secret Service is telling him, stop these big rallies.
[03:03:35.999 --> 03:03:36.859]  There's too many people.
[03:03:36.859 --> 03:03:42.983]  There's small town halls that the other candidates do because they're cowards, not just crowds that they don't have.
[03:03:42.983 --> 03:03:44.264]  And he's saying, no, I'm going to do it.
[03:03:44.264 --> 03:03:47.186]  So that's a real manly trait right there, Mr. Stone.
[03:03:48.661 --> 03:03:53.406]  Well, again, look at this video of this fellow, Thomas DeMossimo.
[03:03:54.105 --> 03:03:57.507]  The guy who attacked him, and it is chilling.
[03:03:57.507 --> 03:03:58.768]  He's waving an Uzi.
[03:03:58.768 --> 03:04:00.950]  Yeah, tell us where to find that video.
[03:04:00.950 --> 03:04:02.791]  Where'd you find that particular video?
[03:04:02.791 --> 03:04:04.672]  I will have to forward it to you.
[03:04:04.672 --> 03:04:08.775]  I got it from a former congressman from North Carolina this morning, a great patriot, Billy Evans.
[03:04:08.775 --> 03:04:14.419]  No, no, I saw stuff about him talking about ISIS, Al Qaeda, and seeing that, and I looked, and I'm going to put his name in and find it.
[03:04:14.419 --> 03:04:16.501]  I'm going to have that for Paul Watson coming up.
[03:04:16.501 --> 03:04:18.142]  I mean, I've seen it in text.
[03:04:18.142 --> 03:04:20.403]  I haven't seen it yet, but he said he wanted to kill Trump.
[03:04:20.403 --> 03:04:21.244]  Why isn't he in trouble?
[03:04:22.822 --> 03:04:24.564]  Yeah, it's extraordinary.
[03:04:24.564 --> 03:04:27.947]  Look, I apologize today for not having our visual feed.
[03:04:27.947 --> 03:04:32.051]  I just spoke to 500 women at lunch about Hillary Clinton.
[03:04:32.051 --> 03:04:35.795]  I'm with a good friend of yours, Ed Dean, who is the king of Florida radio.
[03:04:36.634 --> 03:04:42.300]  Uh, and uh, the palpable buzz here is Trump wins Florida.
[03:04:42.300 --> 03:04:42.841]  Big.
[03:04:42.841 --> 03:04:43.522]  Double digits.
[03:04:43.522 --> 03:04:46.925]  So, they're gonna try to kill him or say he's a mobster, and that's it.
[03:04:46.925 --> 03:04:47.826]  We gotta pray for him.
[03:04:47.826 --> 03:04:49.688]  Trump is the anti-establishment candidate.
[03:04:49.688 --> 03:04:50.529]  We've gotta get behind him.
[03:04:50.529 --> 03:04:52.071]  Roger Stone, thanks for the time.
[03:04:52.071 --> 03:04:52.471]  Great job.
[03:04:52.471 --> 03:04:54.453]  We'll talk to you again soon, sir.
[03:04:54.453 --> 03:04:56.035]  Great to be with you, Alex, as always.
[03:04:56.035 --> 03:04:56.415]  Thank you.
[03:04:56.415 --> 03:04:57.637]  Thanks for all the exclusives you give us.
[03:04:58.479 --> 03:05:12.927]  Action hero Jean-Claude Van Damme told a French television political show that the Rothschild and Rockefeller families will not let Donald Trump win the presidency because he is an anti-globalist candidate.
[03:05:12.927 --> 03:05:19.891]  Appearing on the Le Grand Journal, Van Damme said he was aware of who is really shaping U.S.
[03:05:19.891 --> 03:05:21.412]  presidential elections.
[03:05:21.412 --> 03:05:24.394]  Some of the other participants in the debate looked stunned.
[03:05:24.774 --> 03:05:34.381]  As Van Damme continued to say that the Rothschilds rose to power in 1827 and they now control and dominate entire continents.
[03:05:34.381 --> 03:05:38.263]  And he says Donald Trump is not going to win the election.
[03:05:38.263 --> 03:05:48.130]  He went on to make a distinction between lobbyists that control the other candidates and people like Donald Trump who is truly anti-establishment.

[03:07:00.039 --> 03:07:01.261]  Try a bottle of it.
[03:07:01.261 --> 03:07:02.863]  Rob Dew joins us.
[03:07:02.863 --> 03:07:05.967]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[03:07:05.967 --> 03:07:07.068]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[03:07:07.068 --> 03:07:08.090]  I've been working all day.
[03:07:08.090 --> 03:07:10.513]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:07:10.513 --> 03:07:11.935]  I get in here at 830.
[03:07:11.935 --> 03:07:13.838]  I was kind of run down.
[03:07:13.838 --> 03:07:15.560]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[03:07:15.760 --> 03:07:17.641]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:07:17.641 --> 03:07:20.523]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there and popped two of them.
[03:07:20.523 --> 03:07:22.804]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[03:07:22.804 --> 03:07:24.765]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[03:07:24.765 --> 03:07:26.246]  It's got four and a half stars.
[03:07:26.246 --> 03:07:27.587]  People really love it.
[03:07:27.587 --> 03:07:28.187]  Read about it.
[03:07:28.187 --> 03:07:32.029]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[03:07:32.029 --> 03:07:37.292]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[03:07:37.492 --> 03:07:41.516]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:07:41.516 --> 03:07:47.681]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[03:07:47.681 --> 03:07:53.586]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:08:08.167 --> 03:08:10.310]  You want answers?
[03:08:10.310 --> 03:08:16.376]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:16.376 --> 03:08:19.579]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:19.579 --> 03:08:20.320]  We are back.
[03:08:20.320 --> 03:08:24.464]  It's the fourth hour home drive of the Alex Jones Show with me, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:08:24.464 --> 03:08:28.849]  And as you heard, Alex has been covering the latest Trump news there with Roger Stowe.
[03:08:29.489 --> 03:08:40.984]  Specifically, and this is what I'm going to talk about in this hour, how the media is fermenting an environment which could lead to assassination attempt against Donald Trump.
[03:08:40.984 --> 03:08:43.007]  Now, we've been talking about this for months.
[03:08:43.007 --> 03:08:45.710]  We've been talking about Trump having Secret Service protection.
[03:08:46.551 --> 03:08:59.353]  Back in October last year, of course, Roger Stone revealed recently that Trump wears a bulletproof vest at all times during his public events because these threats are very real.
[03:08:59.353 --> 03:09:12.656]  You can go on Twitter at any time of the day and find hundreds and thousands of people saying either that Trump should be assassinated, somebody should, quote, take one for the team and assassinate Trump,
[03:09:13.676 --> 03:09:17.899]  Or in some cases, they say they're going to do it directly.
[03:09:17.899 --> 03:09:27.605]  Now, of course, we've had this huge scandal about Twitter censoring conservatives for having the wrong political opinions, banning them, deleting their accounts.
[03:09:28.669 --> 03:09:36.233]  These anti-Trump, unhinged, crazed extremists in almost every single case remain on Twitter.
[03:09:36.233 --> 03:09:37.954]  Nothing happens to them.
[03:09:37.954 --> 03:09:42.256]  I've been highlighting several of these tweets over the last few days.
[03:09:42.256 --> 03:09:48.120]  Basically people saying somebody should assassinate Trump, save America from fascism, etc, etc.
[03:09:48.120 --> 03:09:49.981]  Nothing happens to these people.
[03:09:49.981 --> 03:09:55.744]  There was one instance where somebody found out the employment address, the employment of this woman.
[03:09:56.593 --> 03:10:01.877]  Who was a nurse who was making violent threats against both Donald Trump and his family.
[03:10:01.877 --> 03:10:03.818]  She got terminated from her job.
[03:10:03.818 --> 03:10:06.340]  So there are consequences for some of this.
[03:10:06.340 --> 03:10:08.842]  Again, I'm not for getting people fired from their jobs.
[03:10:08.842 --> 03:10:11.964]  I'm just for highlighting the sheer stupidity.
[03:10:12.640 --> 03:10:25.049]  And how it completely counters the media narrative, which we've seen all along, that Donald Trump himself is responsible for the violence that we saw in Chicago on Friday night.
[03:10:25.049 --> 03:10:34.616]  So just to introduce this, let's go to the video, the truth about what happened in Chicago, the riot during the Trump event that was cancelled on Friday night.
[03:10:34.616 --> 03:10:35.217]  Here's that clip.
[03:10:35.757 --> 03:10:46.400]  Crazed violent Bernie Sanders supporters, Black Lives Matter extremists and other leftist agitators crashed a Donald Trump rally in Chicago last night.
[03:10:46.400 --> 03:10:58.283]  Unhinged mobs assaulted people, attacked police, tore up signs, blocked ambulances, fired guns in the air and threatened to rape women.
[03:10:59.133 --> 03:11:04.256]  Oh, but that's just their free speech, cried the media and Bernie Sanders supporters.
[03:11:04.256 --> 03:11:05.136]  Really?
[03:11:05.136 --> 03:11:19.725]  So if Donald Trump voters had crashed a Bernie Sanders event, assaulted his supporters, attacked police, tore up signs, blocked ambulances, fired guns in the air and threatened to rape women, you'd say that was just their free speech?
[03:11:20.526 --> 03:11:24.647]  Look at this Bernie supporter expressing his free speech.
[03:11:24.647 --> 03:11:28.288]  He's an anti-violence activist after all.
[03:11:28.288 --> 03:11:35.030]  Here's another peaceful Bernie voter proudly threatening to physically attack Trump supporters.
[03:11:35.030 --> 03:11:38.911]  Here's a peaceful Bernie supporter flying a communist flag.
[03:11:38.911 --> 03:11:43.852]  A political system responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions of people.
[03:11:44.452 --> 03:11:46.556]  Mmm, so peaceful!
[03:11:46.556 --> 03:11:53.407]  Here are Black Lives Matter supporters wishing that someone had tried to assassinate Trump in Chicago.
[03:11:54.332 --> 03:11:57.873]  Look who showed up to voice his support for the anti-Trump crowd.
[03:11:57.873 --> 03:12:00.993]  Domestic terrorist Bill Ayers.
[03:12:00.993 --> 03:12:03.954]  And who did Megyn Kelly blame for all this?
[03:12:03.954 --> 03:12:05.094]  Donald Trump.
[03:12:05.094 --> 03:12:19.877]  Trump's own rhetoric at his rallies, and in particular, some of the violence we have seen at his rallies, some of the violent clashes with protesters, who often are African-American, has fed into what we're seeing here tonight.
[03:12:19.877 --> 03:12:21.397]  Who did Rachel Maddow blame?
[03:12:22.017 --> 03:12:23.538]  Donald Trump.
[03:12:23.538 --> 03:12:36.122]  Before this rally started, when we saw what was happening in the streets outside this event, and we saw what Donald Trump had done to incite violence, and I'm saying that deliberately, to incite violence from his event earlier today in St.
[03:12:36.122 --> 03:12:36.682]  Louis.
[03:12:36.682 --> 03:12:38.602]  Who did Ted Cruz blame?
[03:12:38.602 --> 03:12:40.123]  Donald Trump.
[03:12:40.123 --> 03:12:43.884]  But in any campaign, responsibility starts at the top.
[03:12:43.884 --> 03:12:48.506]  Any candidate is responsible for the culture of the campaign.
[03:12:48.506 --> 03:12:49.866]  You create an environment
[03:12:56.107 --> 03:13:00.630]  Who did Marco Rubio blame?
[03:13:00.630 --> 03:13:03.332]  You guessed it, Donald Trump.
[03:13:03.332 --> 03:13:04.533]  Donald Trump's rhetoric is to blame.
[03:13:04.533 --> 03:13:06.034]  I guess the Bernie supporters were offended.
[03:13:06.034 --> 03:13:07.194]  Just like the Charlie Hebdo jihadists were offended.
[03:13:07.194 --> 03:13:07.535]  Poor babies!
[03:13:21.804 --> 03:13:32.952]  Listen, if over a thousand violent, angry Trump supporters behaved anything like this, do you think the media would describe them as legitimate protesters?
[03:13:32.952 --> 03:13:43.519]  Oh, but they're protesting against fascism by silencing people's free speech with intimidation tactics and threatening them with violence if they vote a certain way.
[03:13:43.519 --> 03:13:48.123]  Yeah, I'm not sure if you knew this, but that's actually a hallmark of fascism.
[03:13:48.863 --> 03:13:55.706]  These are the people who will riot and burn American cities to the ground if Trump is elected president.
[03:13:55.706 --> 03:13:56.647]  Why?
[03:13:56.647 --> 03:14:05.811]  Because they've been given legitimacy by a mainstream media who said that looting and rioting was an acceptable form of protest after Ferguson.
[03:14:06.616 --> 03:14:18.742]  Black Lives Matter has been given credence despite the fact that its ideological inspiration is a convicted cop killer on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list.
[03:14:18.742 --> 03:14:28.146]  Despite the fact that its supporters have called for killing cops, plotted to bomb police stations, and have actually killed police officers.
[03:14:28.146 --> 03:14:33.809]  This is the group that Hillary Clinton promised to change laws to appease.
[03:14:34.790 --> 03:14:42.695]  Whether you love or loathe Donald Trump, encouraging this kind of mayhem is a recipe for disaster.
[03:14:44.286 --> 03:14:51.953]  So that was the video I put out on Saturday, just a few hours after this news broke about what was happening in Chicago.
[03:14:51.953 --> 03:14:57.397]  It got over 500,000 views at the current state of play.
[03:14:57.397 --> 03:14:59.259]  Now that was what happened in Chicago.
[03:14:59.259 --> 03:15:06.185]  Of course, this was before the crazed domestic extremist who has been celebrated by the social justice warriors and the media.
[03:15:06.485 --> 03:15:06.965]  We're good to go.
[03:15:29.622 --> 03:15:45.682]  And we had this huge media narrative come together immediately after you'll notice this secretive meeting organized by the American Enterprise Institute on a remote island off of Georgia, where they coordinated on how they were going to stop Trump.
[03:15:46.627 --> 03:15:56.689]  Then we had this coordinated media narrative, despite the fact that all this violence was coming from the left, was coming from Bernie Sanders supporters, that it was Trump's fault.
[03:15:56.689 --> 03:16:09.092]  And this narrative continued on Sunday evening, even after the crazed radical tried to assault Trump with the Democratic town hall event with Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.
[03:16:09.092 --> 03:16:14.133]  Let's go to their comments about Trump himself being responsible for the violence.
[03:16:14.133 --> 03:16:14.793]  Here's that video.
[03:16:15.453 --> 03:16:25.902]  Trump said that he is prepared to pay the legal costs of an individual who sucker-punched somebody at a recent event.
[03:16:25.902 --> 03:16:32.708]  He's going to pay the legal fees of somebody who committed a terrible act of violence.
[03:16:33.388 --> 03:16:40.454]  What that means is that Donald Trump is literally inciting violence with his supporters.
[03:16:40.454 --> 03:16:43.977]  He is saying, if you go out and beat somebody up, that's okay.
[03:16:43.977 --> 03:16:46.219]  I'll pay the legal fees.
[03:16:46.219 --> 03:16:51.884]  He actually incites violence in the way that he urges his audience on.
[03:16:52.665 --> 03:16:58.148]  You know, talking about punching people, offering to pay legal bills.
[03:16:58.148 --> 03:17:08.332]  And then on the specifics, you know, we know that he has been incredibly bigoted towards so many groups.
[03:17:08.332 --> 03:17:08.993]  He talks about
[03:17:09.733 --> 03:17:13.918]  Deporting 11, 12 million immigrants.
[03:17:13.918 --> 03:17:15.580]  We're a nation built on immigrants.
[03:17:15.580 --> 03:17:19.966]  He talks about preventing Muslims from coming into our country.
[03:17:19.966 --> 03:17:22.329]  We believe in religious freedom.
[03:17:22.329 --> 03:17:27.956]  There's just so much of what he's doing that I think we all have to reject.
[03:17:29.281 --> 03:17:35.544]  So they have Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders continuing with the narrative that Trump himself is responsible for the violence.
[03:17:35.544 --> 03:17:42.888]  Of course, Clinton there outright brazenly lied and said that Trump wanted to deport 12 million immigrants.
[03:17:42.888 --> 03:17:45.089]  He wants to deport illegal immigrants!
[03:17:45.089 --> 03:17:49.312]  There is a distinction to be made there, so she lied in that instance.
[03:17:49.312 --> 03:17:55.635]  And then again, they jumped on board the bandwagon, demonising Trump, feeding into this media narrative
[03:17:56.255 --> 03:18:15.704]  That he's the one inciting violence, and this has become a big story across all the media networks, all of which have completely ignored the real instances where people are inciting violence on a daily basis against Trump, which is on social media.
[03:18:15.704 --> 03:18:22.607]  You can go right now to Twitter, type in the search box, assassinate Trump, in quotation marks.
[03:18:23.127 --> 03:18:33.572]  See how many tweets there are just over the past 24 hours alone, then compare it to a search for assassinate Hillary or assassinate Bernie.
[03:18:33.572 --> 03:18:36.614]  It's literally a hundred to one.
[03:18:36.614 --> 03:18:39.355]  But again, it's Trump that's inciting violence.
[03:18:39.355 --> 03:18:41.076]  Yes, the comments that he makes about
[03:18:41.596 --> 03:18:46.178]  You know, I want to punch the agitator in the face when he interrupts his rally.
[03:18:46.178 --> 03:18:49.580]  They're silly and stupid comments, but they pale.
[03:18:49.580 --> 03:19:00.364]  They pale in significance and volume to the actual direct death threats that Donald Trump receives on a daily basis, on an hourly basis.
[03:19:00.364 --> 03:19:06.787]  Sometimes it's a hundred an hour, especially immediately after his speeches, his political events.
[03:19:06.787 --> 03:19:08.288]  Now we have Trump supporters
[03:19:09.252 --> 03:19:13.043]  Of course we had the t-shirt that somebody was wearing in Chicago on Friday night.
[03:19:13.043 --> 03:19:15.611]  You know, if you're gonna vote for Trump, you're gonna get jumped!
[03:19:16.271 --> 03:19:31.701]  Because you can't have your own political opinion, you can't have your own democratic choice, because we're anti-fascist protesters, so we're going to protest by acting like fascists and saying we will violently attack you if you disagree with us politically, because that's liberal and trendy.
[03:19:31.701 --> 03:19:41.248]  You've got that going on and now you've got Trump supporters being harassed, being hit with death threats themselves, simply again, for saying they will vote for Trump.
[03:19:41.248 --> 03:19:45.891]  Not only have we had yard signs being torn, ripped up their face, now we've got people getting direct death threats.
[03:19:46.471 --> 03:19:51.794]  We'll get more into it in the next segment on the Alex Jones Show Live 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:19:51.794 --> 03:19:53.615]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:19:53.615 --> 03:19:56.337]  All the breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:19:56.337 --> 03:19:57.057]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:57.057 --> 03:19:57.618]  Don't go away.
[03:20:01.693 --> 03:20:09.098]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a SelectQuote agent with a true story of how SelectQuote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[03:20:09.098 --> 03:20:12.700]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:20:12.700 --> 03:20:16.383]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:20:17.043 --> 03:20:18.864]  I said, let me see.
[03:20:18.864 --> 03:20:29.948]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:20:29.948 --> 03:20:41.073]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.

[03:21:00.462 --> 03:21:01.683]  Try a bottle of it.
[03:21:01.683 --> 03:21:03.284]  Rob Due joins us.
[03:21:03.284 --> 03:21:06.365]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[03:21:06.365 --> 03:21:07.485]  Tell us what BrainForce did.
[03:21:07.485 --> 03:21:08.466]  I've been working all day.
[03:21:08.466 --> 03:21:10.727]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:21:10.947 --> 03:21:14.228]  When I get in here at 830, I was kind of run down.
[03:21:14.228 --> 03:21:16.169]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[03:21:16.169 --> 03:21:18.050]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:21:18.050 --> 03:21:19.891]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[03:21:19.891 --> 03:21:20.931]  I popped two of them.
[03:21:20.931 --> 03:21:23.212]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[03:21:23.212 --> 03:21:25.173]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[03:21:25.173 --> 03:21:26.673]  It's got four and a half stars.
[03:21:26.673 --> 03:21:28.014]  People really love it.
[03:21:28.014 --> 03:21:28.614]  Read about it.
[03:21:28.614 --> 03:21:32.436]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[03:21:32.436 --> 03:21:37.718]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[03:21:37.898 --> 03:21:41.940]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:21:41.940 --> 03:21:48.083]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[03:21:48.083 --> 03:21:53.986]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[03:22:28.140 --> 03:22:31.201]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[03:22:31.201 --> 03:22:33.842]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[03:22:33.842 --> 03:22:34.582]  Croix River.
[03:22:34.582 --> 03:22:36.803]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[03:22:36.803 --> 03:22:39.764]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[03:22:39.764 --> 03:22:40.644]  His excuse?
[03:22:40.644 --> 03:22:41.985]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[03:22:41.985 --> 03:22:43.585]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[03:22:43.585 --> 03:22:49.347]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[03:23:03.839 --> 03:23:06.981]  Does your story go something like Stacey's story goes?
[03:23:06.981 --> 03:23:07.982]  Here's Stacey now.
[03:23:07.982 --> 03:23:13.227]  My husband and I went and visited a resort and they kind of attacked us.
[03:23:13.707 --> 03:23:14.087]  I think so.
[03:23:37.406 --> 03:23:40.687]  To cancel your timeshare contract, call ACC today.

[03:23:47.588 --> 03:23:47.808]  That's 800-587-3948.
[03:23:47.808 --> 03:23:49.728]  No one knows what it's like to be the bad man.
[03:24:06.269 --> 03:24:15.173]  We are back on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:15.173 --> 03:24:16.933]  Oh, I've un-pulled Joseph Watson.
[03:24:16.933 --> 03:24:30.199]  We're talking about Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, the entirety of the media, the political class, demonising Donald Trump, saying that he's to blame for the violent rhetoric, for the violence we saw in Chicago.
[03:24:31.317 --> 03:24:37.199]  When Donald Trump himself is hit by a deluge of death threats on a daily basis.
[03:24:37.199 --> 03:24:44.881]  We had the Egyptian student El Sayed recently basically agreed to be deported because of a threat that he made on Facebook.
[03:24:44.881 --> 03:24:51.143]  Quote, I literally don't mind taking a lifetime sentence in jail for killing this guy.
[03:24:51.143 --> 03:24:52.984]  I would actually be doing the whole world a favor.
[03:24:53.624 --> 03:24:55.965]  He's basically being deported for that.
[03:24:55.965 --> 03:25:04.548]  That's quite mild compared to some of what I see on Twitter every single day regarding death threats made against Donald Trump.
[03:25:04.548 --> 03:25:13.891]  We had the guy try and jump the stage on Saturday saying that he planned this attack, that he was prepared to be a martyr.
[03:25:13.891 --> 03:25:21.393]  He was tweeting emoticons of a gun next to a head in reference to what he planned to do at this event.
[03:25:21.393 --> 03:25:22.654]  Now he was unharmed,
[03:25:23.494 --> 03:25:24.634]  He was unarmed, sorry.
[03:25:24.634 --> 03:25:28.015]  He claimed he was going to get up on the stage and call Donald Trump a racist.
[03:25:28.015 --> 03:25:29.715]  How original.
[03:25:29.715 --> 03:25:31.176]  But who knows what he was going to do.
[03:25:31.176 --> 03:25:31.876]  He was violent.
[03:25:31.876 --> 03:25:32.856]  He was unhinged.
[03:25:32.856 --> 03:25:35.656]  He's been pictured with gangbangers.
[03:25:35.656 --> 03:25:37.197]  So who knows what he was going to do.
[03:25:37.197 --> 03:25:40.497]  But the point is, Trump's getting these death threats.
[03:25:40.497 --> 03:25:44.138]  People are being deported for these death threats in some instances.
[03:25:44.138 --> 03:25:48.539]  There's no way they could find all these people because it's literally thousands a day.
[03:25:49.494 --> 03:25:53.097]  And then we've got this, out of WTOP.com.
[03:25:53.097 --> 03:25:57.280]  Local Trump supporters say she's facing harassment and vandalism.
[03:25:57.280 --> 03:26:05.487]  Someone has stolen the Donald Trump signs from her yard, spray-painted her house with messages, and a motorcyclist stopped to threaten her life.
[03:26:05.487 --> 03:26:11.171]  But a Gainesville, Virginia woman says that while she's frightened and exhausted by the ordeal, she won't be intimidated.
[03:26:11.171 --> 03:26:14.393]  Judy Beattie has vowed to put up more Trump yard signs.
[03:26:15.234 --> 03:26:20.037]  She says she's been told by Virginia State Police they will provide additional security measures.
[03:26:20.037 --> 03:26:22.938]  I can't even tell you how hard it is to deal with something like this.
[03:26:22.938 --> 03:26:27.821]  I feel like I'm very violated at this point and very threatened, says Beatty.
[03:26:27.821 --> 03:26:33.964]  She awoke Wednesday morning to find the Trump signs gone and her neat White House spray-painted with the words, REVOLUTION!
[03:26:33.964 --> 03:26:36.746]  And can you see the new world through the tear gas?
[03:26:36.746 --> 03:26:40.968]  Quote, I get all these nutcases riding by here going, FEEL THE BURN!
[03:26:41.892 --> 03:26:46.133]  I had one guy yesterday telling me I was going to die!
[03:26:46.133 --> 03:26:52.034]  So she's being told that she's going to die, she's having her house vandalised by Bernie Sanders supporters.
[03:26:52.034 --> 03:26:54.274]  I guess Donald Trump's to blame for that.
[03:26:54.274 --> 03:26:56.955]  Let's just blame Donald Trump because that's easier.
[03:26:56.955 --> 03:27:03.776]  Because it fits into this media narrative that's been promoted since Chicago on Friday night by both left and right.
[03:27:03.776 --> 03:27:10.777]  Rachel Maddow, Megyn Kelly, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton right across the board.
[03:27:11.690 --> 03:27:20.879]  So again, there's no louder progenitor of hateful, vitriolic, violent rhetoric than the anti-Trump crowd.
[03:27:20.879 --> 03:27:24.242]  So why is Trump himself being blamed for this violent rhetoric?
[03:27:25.649 --> 03:27:30.572]  Is Fox News reporting on the deluge of death threats being made against Trump?
[03:27:30.572 --> 03:27:44.682]  No, they're too busy lying about a Trump campaign staffer who grabbed a woman by the arm and then Fox News and this woman, this poor victim who was almost crying, claimed that it was some kind of vicious assault before the video came out.
[03:27:44.682 --> 03:27:48.104]  In fact, we can roll this video now as I talk over it.
[03:27:48.104 --> 03:27:50.966]  Basically, it's Donald Trump walking through a venue.
[03:27:50.966 --> 03:27:53.368]  This Breitbart reporter, she's now resigned,
[03:27:54.128 --> 03:27:56.812]  It's trying to ask him a question over and over again.
[03:27:56.812 --> 03:27:58.133]  Trump walks by.
[03:27:58.133 --> 03:28:05.122]  One of Trump's campaign staffers basically grabs her by the arm for about a split second.
[03:28:05.122 --> 03:28:06.003]  And yes, that's wrong.
[03:28:06.003 --> 03:28:07.325]  He shouldn't have done that.
[03:28:07.325 --> 03:28:09.208]  But the way they've overblown this...
[03:28:09.828 --> 03:28:16.851]  She went on to Fox News, she went on to Megyn Kelly afterwards and said, you know, oh, he almost threw me to the ground!
[03:28:16.851 --> 03:28:21.312]  She portrayed it, she characterized it as some kind of vicious assault.
[03:28:21.312 --> 03:28:25.153]  You know, like he was manhandling her like King Kong or something.
[03:28:25.153 --> 03:28:29.655]  The famous scene where, you know, King Kong scoops up the lady.
[03:28:29.655 --> 03:28:32.556]  She was trying to portray it as some kind of vicious attack.
[03:28:32.556 --> 03:28:34.677]  She had a Washington Post eyewitness.
[03:28:34.677 --> 03:28:37.538]  He ginned it up because he wanted to get a story out of it.
[03:28:38.621 --> 03:28:44.183]  And she said, this is the worst thing that's ever happened to me apart from my father dying.
[03:28:44.183 --> 03:28:46.344]  I mean, watch the video clip.
[03:28:46.344 --> 03:28:48.745]  He basically brushes past her.
[03:28:48.745 --> 03:28:52.626]  Yes, he might grab her arm for a split second and he shouldn't have done that.
[03:28:52.626 --> 03:28:58.128]  But the way they've spun this before that video came out, it's a complete hoax.
[03:28:58.948 --> 03:29:06.191]  But they're doing it because it's part of this co-ordinated media campaign to claim that Trump is encouraging violence.
[03:29:06.191 --> 03:29:19.657]  If they can demonise his campaign staffer as being some brutal bully who physically assaults women and tries to throw them to the ground, which is what they claimed this was before the video came out, proving them completely wrong.
[03:29:21.069 --> 03:29:23.591]  Then they can associate it with Trump.
[03:29:23.591 --> 03:29:42.323]  They can claim it's caused by his hateful rhetoric, while he's deluged by a thousand hateful death threats every day on Twitter, while people are trying to jump the stage to attack him, while his supporters are having their property defaced, are being thrown death threats on a daily basis.
[03:29:42.323 --> 03:29:47.106]  We'll get more into it after the break on the Alex Jones Show Live InfoWars.com.
[03:29:47.106 --> 03:29:47.607]  Don't go away.
[03:29:51.589 --> 03:29:58.493]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.493 --> 03:30:06.478]  Last week we reported on one Pablo Serrano Vitorino, an illegal alien who has been charged with killing his neighbor and three other men with an AK-47.
[03:30:06.478 --> 03:30:12.822]  Now it has emerged that US immigration authorities had this man in custody twice last year and let him slip through their fingers.
[03:30:12.822 --> 03:30:15.043]  It also just came out that ICE revealed that a hundred
[03:30:15.764 --> 03:30:21.908]  124 illegal immigrants released from jail by the Obama administration since 2010 have subsequently been charged with murder.
[03:30:21.908 --> 03:30:32.637]  The report from the Center of Immigration Studies reads, the criminal aliens released by ICE in these years, who had already been convicted of thousands of crimes, are responsible for a significant crime spree in American communities, including 124 homicides.
[03:30:34.358 --> 03:30:38.460]  Inexplicably, ICE is choosing to release some criminal aliens multiple times.
[03:30:38.460 --> 03:30:43.202]  John Kasich in Thursday's CNN debate, who said he would enact his largest amnesty in U.S.
[03:30:43.202 --> 03:30:45.343]  history within his first hundred days in office.
[03:30:45.343 --> 03:30:53.187]  Here's a man barely hanging on to his political life, who wants to offer amnesty for people who came here illegally, and some of which have proven to be homicidal maniacs.
[03:30:53.187 --> 03:30:54.928]  Thank God we still have the Second Amendment.
[03:30:54.928 --> 03:30:57.669]  Rob Due reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.

[03:33:07.714 --> 03:33:13.225]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:13.225 --> 03:33:14.126]  Mother!
[03:33:16.445 --> 03:33:20.987]  It's Paul Joseph Watson with the four-hour overdrive of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.987 --> 03:33:24.589]  So basically last night Fox News pulled this stunt once again.
[03:33:24.589 --> 03:33:37.416]  They had the Breitbart writer on, Michelle Fields, who went on there and almost broke down into tears, claiming that she'd been viciously assaulted by this Trump campaign staffer.
[03:33:37.416 --> 03:33:39.037]  They didn't play the video!
[03:33:40.023 --> 03:33:43.686]  Which shows the actual incident where Trump walks past.
[03:33:43.686 --> 03:33:46.388]  She tries to ask him a couple of questions.
[03:33:46.388 --> 03:33:48.690]  Trump ignores this reporter.
[03:33:48.690 --> 03:33:52.293]  So then this campaign staffer basically brushes her aside.
[03:33:52.293 --> 03:33:53.614]  You know, he grabs her arm.
[03:33:53.614 --> 03:33:55.116]  She later showed some bruises.
[03:33:55.116 --> 03:33:56.477]  Who knows where they came from, but...
[03:33:57.392 --> 03:33:58.873]  It wasn't a vicious assault.
[03:33:58.873 --> 03:34:00.654]  I mean, let's be honest about this.
[03:34:00.654 --> 03:34:18.187]  Should they have apologised for it, maybe, but the way it was characterised by Fox News and the way it was woven into this narrative that Trump is this evil Hitler-like authoritarian that's encouraging people to attack anyone who questions him, it was completely blown out of proportion.
[03:34:18.667 --> 03:34:21.729]  And we can see the video again, if we can play that video again.
[03:34:21.729 --> 03:34:33.195]  This is the Breitbart reporter who went on Fox News and almost broke down crying, said that this was the worst thing to happen in her entire life, aside from her own father dying.
[03:34:33.195 --> 03:34:35.237]  She was basically brushed aside.
[03:34:35.237 --> 03:34:42.421]  I mean, if that's the worst thing, the second worst thing that's happened to her in her entire life, then she's probably had a pretty sweet life.
[03:34:43.041 --> 03:34:45.403]  This is completely mischaracterized.
[03:34:45.403 --> 03:34:47.724]  People started resigning from Breitbart.
[03:34:47.724 --> 03:34:49.946]  You had Ben Shapiro resign.
[03:34:49.946 --> 03:34:51.647]  You had Michelle Fields resign.
[03:34:51.647 --> 03:34:53.529]  I think you had another resignation today.
[03:34:53.529 --> 03:34:57.732]  And again, they characterized it as a vicious assault.
[03:34:57.732 --> 03:35:03.376]  They're not reporting on the hundreds and thousands of tweets threatening to kill Donald Trump.
[03:35:03.376 --> 03:35:04.897]  That's not violent rhetoric.
[03:35:04.897 --> 03:35:06.318]  That's not hateful enough.
[03:35:06.318 --> 03:35:10.361]  But somebody brushing aside a reporter, and it's like the end of the world.
[03:35:11.161 --> 03:35:13.943]  So Fox News is not reporting on that.
[03:35:13.943 --> 03:35:20.226]  CNN is not reporting on the violent death threats against Donald Trump on a daily basis.
[03:35:20.226 --> 03:35:25.829]  They're too busy giving a platform to the extremists who tried to attack Trump in Ohio.
[03:35:26.883 --> 03:35:29.746]  Making him out to be a reasonable guy.
[03:35:29.746 --> 03:35:36.733]  This is an individual who said that he was prepared to become a martyr while he was planning this attack.
[03:35:36.733 --> 03:35:42.598]  He got up on Twitter the day before, the day off, said, I've accepted the fact I'm going to be a martyr.
[03:35:42.598 --> 03:35:46.742]  Tweeted an emoji of a gun being fired into someone's head.
[03:35:46.742 --> 03:35:50.065]  The next day he's on CNN and he's perfectly reasonable.
[03:35:50.065 --> 03:35:51.387]  He's a protester.
[03:35:52.412 --> 03:36:04.461]  Okay, so imagine if a crazed right-wing extremist who called himself a martyr for his cause had tried to get up on stage and accost Hillary Clinton.
[03:36:04.461 --> 03:36:07.843]  Would CNN be trying to legitimize and humanize the guy?
[03:36:07.843 --> 03:36:10.064]  Would they call him a protester?
[03:36:10.064 --> 03:36:18.290]  You know, what if one of the Oregon militia members had got up on stage and tried to, you know, hijack Bernie Sanders' platform?
[03:36:18.290 --> 03:36:21.853]  Would CNN call him a legitimate protester?
[03:36:22.409 --> 03:36:33.741]  No, but they're spinning this coordinated narrative that violence is acceptable if it's directed against Donald Trump, because it's Donald Trump's fault.
[03:36:33.741 --> 03:36:42.730]  Then you have Twitter, which of course bans conservatives for having the wrong politics, still giving this guy a platform.
[03:36:42.730 --> 03:36:45.392]  This guy who jumped up on stage to try and attack Trump.
[03:36:46.360 --> 03:36:49.481]  They're not censoring him, they're not deleting his account.
[03:36:49.481 --> 03:36:51.121]  This again sends the message.
[03:36:51.121 --> 03:36:57.602]  CNN giving him a platform sends the message to thousands of other potentially violent lunatics.
[03:36:57.602 --> 03:37:02.443]  You too can become a media star by physically attacking Trump.
[03:37:02.443 --> 03:37:04.563]  They're legitimizing this.
[03:37:04.563 --> 03:37:06.304]  They're encouraging this.
[03:37:06.304 --> 03:37:08.924]  They're inciting violence.
[03:37:08.924 --> 03:37:13.025]  The media is inciting violence, not Donald Trump.
[03:37:14.164 --> 03:37:17.646]  Then look what happened in Chicago, as you heard in the video before.
[03:37:17.646 --> 03:37:21.789]  You know, imagine if Donald Trump supporters had crashed a Bernie Sanders rally.
[03:37:21.789 --> 03:37:31.516]  Imagine if they were caught on camera firing machine guns, blocking ambulances, assaulting people, waving Nazi flags.
[03:37:31.516 --> 03:37:35.098]  Would the media describe them as peaceful protesters?
[03:37:35.098 --> 03:37:35.219]  No!
[03:37:36.075 --> 03:37:38.857]  Yeah, that's all we've heard since Chicago.
[03:37:38.857 --> 03:37:43.760]  So again, this is the classic leftist social justice warrior tactic.
[03:37:43.760 --> 03:37:49.023]  You stage the violence and then you claim that you're the victim.
[03:37:49.023 --> 03:37:51.645]  And today the Washington Post came out and doubled down on this.
[03:37:52.711 --> 03:38:01.037]  They basically lied and tried to claim that Trump had cocked up a giant conspiracy to sabotage his own event in Chicago.
[03:38:01.037 --> 03:38:06.321]  You know, like Trump controls the George Soros-funded radicals who caused this mayhem.
[03:38:07.293 --> 03:38:18.056]  So they were like, how dare Donald Trump even plan to have an event in Chicago, given the amount of people, the amount of, you know, leftists who support Bernie Sanders, who support Hillary Clinton.
[03:38:18.056 --> 03:38:20.396]  How dare he even go to Chicago?
[03:38:20.396 --> 03:38:23.377]  How dare he violate their safe space?
[03:38:23.377 --> 03:38:26.278]  Like a Republican candidate is not even allowed to go there.
[03:38:26.278 --> 03:38:27.618]  And of course, it's his fault.
[03:38:27.618 --> 03:38:29.438]  It's all his fault.
[03:38:29.438 --> 03:38:31.939]  It's his fault that the ambulance has got blocked.
[03:38:31.939 --> 03:38:35.700]  It's his fault that they're running around assaulting people, firing guns in the air.
[03:38:35.700 --> 03:38:36.180]  Because again,
[03:38:37.082 --> 03:38:39.343]  This is the narrative being pushed.
[03:38:39.343 --> 03:38:44.807]  Violence is justified because you don't have to take responsibility for it.
[03:38:44.807 --> 03:38:48.569]  Just as they didn't have to take responsibility in Ferguson, in Baltimore.
[03:38:48.569 --> 03:38:51.711]  Just blame Donald Trump.
[03:38:51.711 --> 03:39:05.260]  So every major politician, you saw Bernie Sanders, you saw Hillary Clinton, unify simultaneously to promote this mantra that Trump's rhetoric is responsible for the violence.
[03:39:06.294 --> 03:39:09.756]  When he's the target of the violence again and again.
[03:39:09.756 --> 03:39:13.759]  Yes, he made silly comments about wanting to punch people in the face.
[03:39:15.174 --> 03:39:17.537]  But he's not inciting the violence.
[03:39:17.537 --> 03:39:23.864]  You compare that to the violence that's being incited on Twitter every single day.
[03:39:23.864 --> 03:39:26.046]  That is inciting violence.
[03:39:26.046 --> 03:39:28.048]  CNN won't talk about it.
[03:39:28.048 --> 03:39:30.171]  Fox News won't talk about it.
[03:39:30.171 --> 03:39:36.218]  Because they're protecting this establishment narrative that Donald Trump is responsible for the violence.
[03:39:37.435 --> 03:39:53.359]  Now let's go to this clip, which is basically a bunch of GOP insiders, this is really interesting, sat round a table, this is out of a PBS documentary I think that's about to air, scheming on how they're going to stop Donald Trump.
[03:39:53.359 --> 03:39:55.859]  Listen to how desperate they sound.
[03:39:55.859 --> 03:39:58.500]  Listen to the message that they're conveying.
[03:39:59.810 --> 03:40:01.312]  Which is what we've said all along.
[03:40:01.312 --> 03:40:05.436]  The media, the political class, cannot control Donald Trump.
[03:40:05.436 --> 03:40:07.078]  Whether you love him or loathe him.
[03:40:07.078 --> 03:40:09.680]  And I don't agree with many of his policies.
[03:40:09.680 --> 03:40:10.902]  But he's a maverick.
[03:40:10.902 --> 03:40:12.463]  He's self-funded.
[03:40:12.463 --> 03:40:14.385]  He's outside of their control.
[03:40:14.385 --> 03:40:16.367]  He's unpredictable.
[03:40:16.367 --> 03:40:18.890]  And this whole thing is bigger than Donald Trump.
[03:40:19.531 --> 03:40:38.307]  If Donald Trump loses, if Hillary gets him, whatever happens, this will merely continue to build because it's part of a political revolution that is a complete rejection of the establishment, of the lobbyists, of people being screwed over and not represented by the Washington elite.
[03:40:38.307 --> 03:40:46.114]  Now listen to the arrogance of these GOP insiders as they scheme in their desperation of how they're going to stop Trump.
[03:40:46.114 --> 03:40:47.015]  Let's go to that clip.
[03:40:51.485 --> 03:40:57.968]  Everybody around this table that I know, we've been in every presidential campaign probably since 1980 in various degrees.
[03:40:57.968 --> 03:41:00.849]  And in Trump's problem, he doesn't have a compass.
[03:41:00.849 --> 03:41:05.191]  You don't know what his compass is.
[03:41:05.191 --> 03:41:07.712]  And how problematic is that for the future of the party?
[03:41:07.712 --> 03:41:10.793]  I think before it's all over, it's going to be hugely problematic.
[03:41:10.793 --> 03:41:16.736]  I talk to people all the time, because I'm sure everybody around the table does, and they say, why don't you Republicans do something about this guy?
[03:41:19.708 --> 03:41:21.809]  I'm sorry, this is not the Soviet Union.
[03:41:21.809 --> 03:41:24.350]  We can't call a meeting and decide Trump is out.
[03:41:24.350 --> 03:41:26.991]  And we hate that.
[03:41:26.991 --> 03:41:28.091]  Benign dictatorship.
[03:41:28.091 --> 03:41:29.051]  Who's for it?
[03:41:29.051 --> 03:41:30.912]  Trump is doing well for one reason.
[03:41:30.912 --> 03:41:36.014]  He understands the climate and the culture of America today better than anybody at this table.
[03:41:36.014 --> 03:41:41.556]  How do you feel about the fact that the Republican nominee may be someone that none of you know?
[03:41:41.556 --> 03:41:42.076]  Shellshocked.
[03:41:42.660 --> 03:41:43.460]  Bewildered.
[03:41:43.460 --> 03:41:46.682]  Republicans are hierarchical, respectful of authority.
[03:41:46.682 --> 03:41:48.082]  We fall in line.
[03:41:48.082 --> 03:41:50.543]  And Trump has interrupted that cycle.
[03:41:50.543 --> 03:41:51.564]  Donald Trump?
[03:41:51.564 --> 03:41:54.365]  Nobody thought of him as any kind of political leader until six months ago.
[03:41:54.365 --> 03:41:56.186]  He's not articulate.
[03:41:56.186 --> 03:41:57.166]  He's not poised.
[03:41:57.166 --> 03:41:58.647]  He's not informed.
[03:41:58.647 --> 03:42:01.268]  All he has going for him is a lot of votes.
[03:42:01.268 --> 03:42:03.549]  Why hasn't any of that hit home?
[03:42:03.549 --> 03:42:05.050]  Here we are.
[03:42:05.050 --> 03:42:05.710]  Here we are.
[03:42:09.386 --> 03:42:13.651]  I think everyone's kind of buying into this he's inevitable and that he can't be stopped.
[03:42:13.651 --> 03:42:15.013]  I believe he can be stopped.
[03:42:15.013 --> 03:42:18.717]  What are you doing or plan to do to stop him?
[03:42:18.717 --> 03:42:20.399]  He's working with K-9s.
[03:42:20.399 --> 03:42:21.240]  Exactly.
[03:42:21.240 --> 03:42:22.241]  What are you doing?
[03:42:22.241 --> 03:42:22.901]  We're working on it.
[03:42:25.319 --> 03:42:28.643]  We were effective in Iowa, and that was enough to knock him into second.
[03:42:28.643 --> 03:42:30.365]  None of us know who you're talking about.
[03:42:30.365 --> 03:42:31.667]  Our principal.
[03:42:31.667 --> 03:42:32.528]  Katie Packer.
[03:42:32.528 --> 03:42:33.008]  Katie Packer.
[03:42:33.008 --> 03:42:34.410]  What's your role in that pack?
[03:42:34.410 --> 03:42:35.772]  Polling.
[03:42:35.772 --> 03:42:38.254]  Which is now public record.
[03:42:38.254 --> 03:42:39.896]  Which concerns you more?
[03:42:39.896 --> 03:42:43.300]  That he'd lose the general if he were the nominee, or how he'd do as president?
[03:42:43.300 --> 03:42:44.202]  Losing the election.
[03:42:45.891 --> 03:42:49.472]  What we're facing is a choice between Hillary and Donald Trump.
[03:42:49.472 --> 03:42:52.794]  So what you're saying is vote for the least of two evils?
[03:42:52.794 --> 03:42:55.094]  Do you know for sure Trump would be a better president than Hillary?
[03:42:55.094 --> 03:42:58.235]  No, but it's a risk that I'm willing to take.
[03:42:58.235 --> 03:43:01.757]  If we get off into splitting our party, we can't put it back together.
[03:43:01.757 --> 03:43:03.577]  Humpty Dumpty won't come back together.
[03:43:03.577 --> 03:43:06.638]  That's the great dividing line in that question right there.
[03:43:06.638 --> 03:43:08.419]  Because you care more about it being president.
[03:43:08.419 --> 03:43:09.619]  I'm scared of him as president.
[03:43:09.619 --> 03:43:11.060]  I think he's an authoritarian figure.
[03:43:11.520 --> 03:43:26.774]  ...to deport 12 million people, build a wall on the Mexican border, and impose a religious test on people coming into this country is so violent... Okay, so that's showtime clip of a bunch of GOP insiders sat round a table discussing how they're gonna stop Donald Trump.
[03:43:26.774 --> 03:43:34.281]  Again, a couple of them get it that this is representative of a wider revolution that's outside of the Republican Party.
[03:43:34.281 --> 03:43:35.883]  It's outside of Donald Trump.
[03:43:36.503 --> 03:43:46.622]  But others lament the fact that this isn't the Soviet Union, that they can't act as, quote, benign dictators and just throw him out of the race altogether.
[03:43:46.622 --> 03:43:48.125]  And how shifty did they look?
[03:43:48.795 --> 03:43:54.041]  While they were asking each other about the little schemes they're going to cook up to try and get rid of Donald Trump.
[03:43:54.041 --> 03:43:55.262]  It's a very interesting clip.
[03:43:55.262 --> 03:43:57.945]  You can see the full clip on YouTube.
[03:43:57.945 --> 03:44:07.515]  But a more accurate summation of what's going on with Trump was voiced today by David Stockman, former US Office of Management and Budget Director.
[03:44:08.266 --> 03:44:16.152]  He was on Bloomberg to discuss Trump's role against the Washington and Wall Street establishment and why no president can save the US economy.
[03:44:16.152 --> 03:44:17.813]  Let's go to this Bloomberg clip.
[03:44:17.813 --> 03:44:19.534]  This is David Stockman.
[03:44:19.534 --> 03:44:29.282]  It's the week when Donald Trump sows it up or is John Kasich gonna be the fly in the ointment and win the Ohio race?
[03:44:29.282 --> 03:44:36.087]  I think it looks pretty inevitable but I would say that Donald Trump is a flying wedge of repudiation
[03:44:36.807 --> 03:44:45.975]  To the whole phony Washington Wall Street narrative that everything is fixed and we're going to go on and live happily ever after.
[03:44:45.975 --> 03:44:46.876]  He is right.
[03:44:46.876 --> 03:44:55.503]  The great unwashed masses of Main Street know the only thing that's happened is that we have another huge financial bubble.
[03:44:55.503 --> 03:44:59.847]  That a few thousand traders and hedge funds have made a killing.
[03:44:59.847 --> 03:45:04.731]  That a few million households who have the financial assets are better off
[03:45:05.271 --> 03:45:11.036]  And everyone else is no better off, in fact, worse than they were before the crisis.
[03:45:11.036 --> 03:45:28.451]  So what he is articulating, and I don't agree with half of what he says and his wall on the Mexican border and so forth, but what he's articulating is the establishment scam is an untruth, it's a big lie, and we're going to face a day of reckoning here.
[03:45:29.131 --> 03:45:31.592]  So that's David Stockman on Bloomberg.
[03:45:31.592 --> 03:45:33.913]  He gets it that this is bigger than Trump.
[03:45:33.913 --> 03:45:35.774]  It's bigger than the Republican Party.
[03:45:35.774 --> 03:45:38.576]  Some of the GOP establishments still don't get that.
[03:45:38.576 --> 03:45:46.319]  And they're still desperate from allowing Donald Trump to get anywhere near the White House, even if that involves supporting Hillary Clinton.
[03:45:46.319 --> 03:45:48.521]  So now we've seen this huge media narrative.
[03:45:48.521 --> 03:45:52.763]  This is the latest big gambit to sink Donald Trump's credibility.
[03:45:53.783 --> 03:45:59.845]  To blame him for this violence, and in fact to encourage more violence.
[03:45:59.845 --> 03:46:03.166]  This is the escalation that they hope to trigger.
[03:46:03.166 --> 03:46:16.071]  They want to incite more violence by blaming Donald Trump for inciting violence, therefore giving people who want to commit violence, and there are plenty of mentally deranged people out there perfectly willing to do that,
[03:46:16.591 --> 03:46:20.713]  Giving them the legitimacy to go ahead and do it.
[03:46:20.713 --> 03:46:27.816]  That's what's happening in the aftermath of this domestic extremist who tried to rush the stage on Saturday night.
[03:46:27.816 --> 03:46:34.679]  But this climate of violence and intimidation now sweeping America has nothing to do with Donald Trump.
[03:46:34.679 --> 03:46:42.122]  It has everything to do with the president who said that what happened in Ferguson was an understandable form of protest.
[03:46:43.191 --> 03:46:49.297]  Okay, Michael Brown, a thug who charged her and tried to grab a cop's gun.
[03:46:49.297 --> 03:46:54.362]  That was their big icon for this big protest in Ferguson.
[03:46:54.362 --> 03:46:56.844]  But Obama said that that was legitimate.
[03:46:56.844 --> 03:46:59.587]  That was understandable to protest that incident.
[03:46:59.587 --> 03:47:04.392]  And of course they protested it by burning and looting the entire city.
[03:47:04.392 --> 03:47:07.214]  By raising black-owned businesses to the ground.
[03:47:07.995 --> 03:47:14.382]  Then you had the likes of Time Magazine, who are also to blame for this climate of violence now sweeping America.
[03:47:15.134 --> 03:47:19.918]  For asserting that violent rioting is a legitimate form of protest.
[03:47:19.918 --> 03:47:21.540]  Remember the headline?
[03:47:21.540 --> 03:47:23.281]  In defense of rioting.
[03:47:23.281 --> 03:47:24.742]  Time Magazine.
[03:47:24.742 --> 03:47:32.389]  And of course that was a message acted upon by the thugs who ransacked Baltimore just five or six months later.
[03:47:32.389 --> 03:47:33.830]  So I blame the media.
[03:47:33.830 --> 03:47:35.432]  This is not Donald Trump's fault.
[03:47:35.432 --> 03:47:40.877]  This goes way back before Donald Trump even came onto the scene in the presidential race.
[03:47:41.738 --> 03:47:48.843]  You had the media parroting the hands-up, don't-shoot hoax that fuelled the Ferguson unrest.
[03:47:48.843 --> 03:47:50.245]  Never happened.
[03:47:50.245 --> 03:48:00.913]  No evidence it ever happened, yet for months and months the media parroted that lie to stoke up this resentment, this racial division in America.
[03:48:00.913 --> 03:48:10.200]  And then I blame Hillary Clinton, I blame the New York Times and the political class for anointing Black Lives Matter as a respectable political movement.
[03:48:10.868 --> 03:48:18.491]  That doesn't mean that certain people within Black Lives Matter or people that support some of its aims, you know, aren't decent, respectable people.
[03:48:18.491 --> 03:48:32.936]  But the leadership, the founders, you look at the three founders of Black Lives Matter, their ideological inspiration, and this is the woman whose name they chant over and over again at Black Lives Matter rallies, Assata Shakur.
[03:48:34.465 --> 03:48:39.366]  She's a convicted cop killer who is on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorist list.
[03:48:39.366 --> 03:48:42.467]  That's the icon for Black Lives Matter.
[03:48:42.467 --> 03:48:53.810]  Imagine if the Oregon Militia Group announced that their icon was Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, and then they got a glowing profile in the New York Times.
[03:48:53.810 --> 03:48:55.570]  Not gonna happen!
[03:48:55.570 --> 03:48:58.371]  So why has it happened with Black Lives Matter?
[03:48:58.371 --> 03:49:03.352]  Well, it's because the media is to blame for inciting this racial division in America.
[03:49:04.594 --> 03:49:11.455]  They want to keep people divided because they don't want people to come together and realize that we've got problems outside of race.
[03:49:11.455 --> 03:49:14.936]  The problem is this political establishment.
[03:49:14.936 --> 03:49:19.097]  And that's why Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are getting all these supporters.
[03:49:19.097 --> 03:49:22.278]  So Donald Trump isn't to blame for that.
[03:49:22.278 --> 03:49:24.558]  So we've got this environment that's now being created.
[03:49:24.558 --> 03:49:26.779]  In fact, there's an article out of Breitbart by Rahim Kassan.
[03:49:28.792 --> 03:49:38.757]  He points out that the media's role now is to send out a green light to every lunatic that it's legitimate to try and attack Trump.
[03:49:38.757 --> 03:49:41.779]  This is part of the Dirty Tricks campaign that they've now launched.
[03:49:43.018 --> 03:49:48.141]  Because they're going to force, you know, the security at Trump rallies to be more oppressive.
[03:49:48.141 --> 03:49:52.064]  They're going to force Trump to stand further away from his audience.
[03:49:52.064 --> 03:50:02.651]  You saw the video just yesterday, I think it might have played earlier, it's up on Infowars.com, where this guy who legally emigrated to the United States wants to get up on stage.
[03:50:02.651 --> 03:50:10.336]  Obviously a big PR boon for Donald Trump, but Trump's hesitant to even allow him to get up on stage in the first place, given what happened on Saturday.
[03:50:11.334 --> 03:50:12.695]  So you're going to see more of that.
[03:50:12.695 --> 03:50:15.937]  Trump's going to be more isolated from the crowd.
[03:50:15.937 --> 03:50:28.046]  So it's going to tamp down on, you know, that kind of energy that's driven him forward so much because of these concerns that violent lunatics could infiltrate these rallies and try to attack Trump.
[03:50:28.846 --> 03:50:47.171]  Because that's what the media is encouraging, by venerating violence, by holding up this guy who tried to jump Trump on Saturday, CNN, and giving him a platform, giving him legitimacy and credibility, therefore encouraging other people to do the same.
[03:50:47.171 --> 03:50:50.032]  We're going to be back in the final segment with more news stories.
[03:50:50.032 --> 03:50:55.554]  This is Paul Joseph Watson, 4th Hour Overdrive Live, BreakingNewsInfoWars.com.

[03:51:17.071 --> 03:51:19.512]  There's more money in treating symptoms.

[03:51:59.791 --> 03:52:03.574]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:52:03.574 --> 03:52:11.320]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:52:11.320 --> 03:52:19.947]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:52:19.947 --> 03:52:26.552]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water,
[03:52:26.752 --> 03:52:34.176]  Into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:52:34.176 --> 03:52:37.578]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:52:37.578 --> 03:52:48.724]  AnthroPlex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[03:52:54.727 --> 03:52:58.730]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[03:52:58.730 --> 03:53:05.755]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[03:53:05.755 --> 03:53:10.379]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.

[03:54:06.897 --> 03:54:07.437]  We are back.
[03:54:07.437 --> 03:54:11.060]  It's the final segment of 4th Hour Overdrive with me, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:54:11.060 --> 03:54:19.507]  Now, everything I've talked about over the last hour will be summarized in a video that's going up in a few hours called The Assassination of Donald Trump.
[03:54:19.507 --> 03:54:22.409]  That's what the media, the political class, is now encouraging.
[03:54:22.409 --> 03:54:24.231]  They can't assassinate his character.
[03:54:24.231 --> 03:54:25.832]  They've failed miserably.
[03:54:25.832 --> 03:54:34.438]  So now they're actually encouraging his physical assassination by inciting violence, by legitimizing people who attack him.
[03:54:35.499 --> 03:54:38.362]  And now we've got a story out of RT which is related to that.
[03:54:38.362 --> 03:54:45.230]  Trump Militia Twitter group vows to protect Donald's supporters following clashes and stage attack.
[03:54:45.230 --> 03:54:54.059]  So basically you had a bunch of people come together and say they're going to act as a kind of vigilante group to try and protect Trump from these extremists.
[03:54:54.059 --> 03:54:54.720]  What happened?
[03:54:55.717 --> 03:55:01.600]  Well, within hours of them setting up this Twitter account they got 500 followers or so.
[03:55:01.600 --> 03:55:14.668]  An anti-Trump extremist direct messaged the creator of this Twitter account a photo of his child's school accompanied with a message, I'm coming for him.
[03:55:14.668 --> 03:55:21.812]  So they had to close the Twitter account because the anti-Trump extremists were threatening to kill this guy's kids.
[03:55:22.881 --> 03:55:26.125]  But Donald Trump's responsible for inciting violence.
[03:55:26.125 --> 03:55:28.348]  They're just peaceful protesters.
[03:55:28.348 --> 03:55:32.613]  The ones making death threats to kill somebody's kids.
[03:55:32.613 --> 03:55:35.136]  Just peaceful protesters.
[03:55:35.136 --> 03:55:40.022]  The Telegraph is reporting the KKK leader who says he backs Hillary Clinton.
[03:55:41.323 --> 03:55:50.028]  If Donald Trump is ambivalent about the KKK and other fringe groups he's been linked with, he can rest assured that, for some at least, the feeling is mutual.
[03:55:50.028 --> 03:55:55.011]  The demagogic Republican frontrunners come under fire for failing to adequately disavow the support of David Duke.
[03:55:56.010 --> 03:56:00.692]  Well now, William Gwyg is campaigning for Hillary Clinton.
[03:56:00.692 --> 03:56:02.793]  He's a KKK member.
[03:56:02.793 --> 03:56:07.635]  When will Hillary Clinton disavow this KKK supporter?
[03:56:07.635 --> 03:56:17.160]  And even if she does, let's ask her to disavow this KKK supporter about 200 more times, even though she's already disavowed him.
[03:56:17.160 --> 03:56:20.881]  Because that's what they did with Donald Trump for about two weeks.
[03:56:20.881 --> 03:56:24.663]  And they still say he hasn't disavowed David Duke.
[03:56:26.010 --> 03:56:36.376]  We've got Gateway Pundit reporting, video unearthed, pastor calls for execution of gays, then introduces Ted Cruz at conference.
[03:56:36.376 --> 03:56:51.206]  So this completely demented pastor is leaping around on stage, ranting about how Leviticus authorizes, mandates the execution of gay people, then minutes later he introduces Donald Trump.
[03:56:51.206 --> 03:56:53.147]  So you've got this pro-Cruz pastor
[03:56:54.580 --> 03:57:05.288]  Introducing Cruz, I'm sorry, talking about wanting to kill gay people, saying they should be executed before he endorses and introduces Ted Cruz.
[03:57:05.288 --> 03:57:10.912]  So he's spouting ISIS-like hate rhetoric, wanting to kill gay people.
[03:57:10.912 --> 03:57:11.893]  He supports Ted Cruz.
[03:57:12.867 --> 03:57:16.908]  But Donald Trump is the bigot and hates gay people and he's inciting violence.
[03:57:16.908 --> 03:57:25.571]  We have Breitbart reporting pictures migrants place babies on train tracks demand racist Europe open its borders.
[03:57:25.571 --> 03:57:34.013]  Migrants have placed their babies, toddlers and young European young children on railway tracks in Greece in a bid to blackmail European authorities into reopening their borders.
[03:57:34.773 --> 03:57:38.657]  So you had the signs at the Macedonian border, open the border or die!
[03:57:38.657 --> 03:57:39.959]  That didn't work.
[03:57:39.959 --> 03:57:47.787]  Now they're actually using their children as human shields, putting them on train tracks to try and elicit sympathy.
[03:57:47.787 --> 03:57:49.889]  We've seen that before.
[03:57:49.889 --> 03:57:56.216]  We've seen migrants being paid to pose as people drowning in the sea when you can see that they're on the shore stood up.
[03:57:57.691 --> 03:58:05.036]  Again, brazen propaganda and that's why in Germany anti-immigrant AFD makes huge gains in votes.
[03:58:05.036 --> 03:58:12.161]  Exit polls preliminary results in the German regional elections show significant success for the right-wing AFD party.
[03:58:12.161 --> 03:58:16.564]  So Merkel is in trouble because the German people haven't been represented.
[03:58:16.564 --> 03:58:18.325]  They've been censored on Facebook.
[03:58:18.325 --> 03:58:23.109]  They've got police visits happening simply for criticizing the migrant crisis.
[03:58:23.109 --> 03:58:26.291]  And now you see the conservative backlash sweeping Europe.
[03:58:27.159 --> 03:58:28.661]  That's going to do it for the show.
[03:58:28.661 --> 03:58:29.623]  Nightly News Tonight.
[03:58:29.623 --> 03:58:32.367]  Alex will be back 11 to 2 tomorrow.
