[00:00:00.723 --> 00:00:04.386]  For a long time now, there's been too much secrecy in this city.
[00:00:04.386 --> 00:00:12.273]  The old rules said that if there was a defensible argument for not disclosing something to the American people, then it should not be disclosed.
[00:00:12.273 --> 00:00:14.175]  That era is now over.
[00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:20.621]  Remember when President Obama claimed that his administration would be the most transparent in history?
[00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:27.206]  We have put in place the toughest ethics laws and toughest transparency rules of any administration in history.
[00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:27.607]  In history!
[00:00:30.407 --> 00:00:52.121]  Fast forward to today, Obama's administration will go down as the least transparent in American history, denying access to FOIA requests, censoring government files, and as the AP reports, a mountain of claims that the Obama administration couldn't find the requested documents on well over 215,000 occasions.
[00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:58.025]  The Obama administration isn't just non-transparent, it is also blatantly criminal.
[00:00:58.385 --> 00:01:09.490]  Acknowledging that within nearly one in three cases that its initial decisions to withhold or censor records were improper under the law, but only when it was challenged.
[00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.232]  And under that umbrella of deceit, a Goliath spy state has grown.
[00:01:14.232 --> 00:01:25.898]  It may appear that Obama is a lame-duck president, but while we were distracted with the erosion of our national security, President Obama recently penned a memo to ramp up an expansion of the sharing network
[00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:29.940]  of intercepted data of American citizens by the NSA.
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.683]  Last month, President Obama released his fiscal 2016 budget request.
[00:01:34.683 --> 00:01:45.269]  Of course, the transparency concerning billions of dollars requested for the giant tax-dollar-sucking tick feeding on our Bill of Rights was missing.
[00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:45.629]  U.S.
[00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:46.890]  News and World Report wrote,
[00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:57.997]  Representative Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont, said of Obama's black budget omission, The Office of the Director of National Intelligence disclosed the administration's aggregate non-military intelligence spending request.
[00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:22.955]  as $53.9 billion, up from $50.4 billion for fiscal year 2015.
[00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:27.759]  And of course, all those billions are doing very little to stop terror.
[00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:36.748]  As yet, once again, Haaretz reports that Belgian intelligence had a precise warning of the recent airport and subway attacks.
[00:02:37.068 --> 00:02:55.338]  But rather than protect our freedoms as a result of the Brussels-Belgium bombings, the TSA is incrementally expanding outside of the airport into all forms of mass transit, as a blanketed police state of viper teams become the new norm at train stations, bus stations and sporting events.
[00:02:55.618 --> 00:03:05.065]  Well, Wolf, the TSA is preparing to launch a specialized group, a specialized unit at airports in major cities, the so-called Viper Teams.
[00:03:05.065 --> 00:03:10.569]  They use everything from bomb-sniffing dogs to advanced specialized screening.
[00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:21.897]  And although the federal government says there is no threat, when you look at the procedures we're seeing across the nation, it is clear that the attacks overseas has stoked increased concerns over the U.S.
[00:03:21.897 --> 00:03:22.678]  transit system.
[00:03:23.425 --> 00:03:29.126]  Ushering in random bag checks and drug sniffing dogs to become commonplace occurrences.
[00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:32.667]  You may say, what else are we supposed to do?
[00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:36.088]  Terrorist events are spiraling out of control.
[00:03:36.088 --> 00:03:43.650]  But if you pull back the curtain, it's clear that it is the entire New World Order system that is spiraling out of control.
[00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.570]  This really happened.
[00:03:46.152 --> 00:03:55.100]  His executive order 12,425 gives complete and total diplomatic immunity to all members or designate agents of Interpol.
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.423]  This big private police consortium out of Europe, now global.
[00:03:58.423 --> 00:04:01.326]  One of the dirtiest police organizations on the planet.
[00:04:01.326 --> 00:04:04.429]  Hooked in with just drug running, child kidnapping.
[00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:06.410]  You can pull up all the mainstream news articles about it.
[00:04:07.131 --> 00:04:14.275]  And they are to have total diplomatic immunity, something police, military, FBI don't have, and they shouldn't have.
[00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:18.957]  But worse than that, then the FBI, if they act through Interpol, they do get it.
[00:04:18.957 --> 00:04:20.118]  And then here's FEMA.
[00:04:20.118 --> 00:04:30.543]  This is a FEMA press release, NLE09, held back in July, with troops from 14 different countries to, quote, take on American domestic terrorists.
[00:04:30.543 --> 00:04:32.024]  So, so, I mean...
[00:04:34.895 --> 00:04:38.139]  The Army War College teaches they're going to use foreign assets in America.
[00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:45.427]  I mean, they're actually getting the police and military ready through the Threat Fusion Integration Centers for foreign troops.
[00:04:45.427 --> 00:04:48.050]  Groups like ISIL can't destroy us.
[00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.931]  They can't defeat us.
[00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:50.133]  They don't produce anything.
[00:04:50.133 --> 00:04:50.513]  They're not...
[00:04:51.854 --> 00:04:54.376]  An existential threat to us.
[00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:59.539]  Once your mind is enslaved, imprisoning your body is a simple task.
[00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:09.165]  Ted Cruz ignores the real source of radical Islam, and that is the special relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.
[00:05:09.165 --> 00:05:16.250]  Presidential candidate Ted Cruz sidestepped his proposal to patrol Muslim neighborhoods during an interview with CNN.
[00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:26.792]  If you have a neighborhood where there is a high level of gang activity, the way to prevent it is you increase the law enforcement presence there, and you target the gang members to get them off the street.
[00:05:26.792 --> 00:05:31.674]  I am talking about any area where there is a higher incidence of radical Islamic terrorism.
[00:05:31.674 --> 00:05:34.534]  Cruz completely sidestepped the real issue.
[00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:41.356]  That is the creation, promotion, and support of radical Islamic terrorists by Saudi Arabia and the United States.
[00:05:41.756 --> 00:05:55.792]  As a political opportunist, supported by Goldman Sachs, the CFR, and the establishment, Cruz must embrace the terror war narrative and its lies, delusions, omissions, and misrepresentations of the truth.

[00:05:59.216 --> 00:06:00.037]  Hey, everyone!
[00:06:00.037 --> 00:06:06.162]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:06:06.162 --> 00:06:08.244]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:06:08.244 --> 00:06:18.513]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:06:18.513 --> 00:06:24.498]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:39.951]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:40.351]  Thank you.
[00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:09.572]  You're investing in your health and supporting the InfoWar when you visit InfoWarsLife.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 Nation Iodine and all the great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:09.572 --> 00:07:15.499]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:17.542]  Iodine is key, is paramount.
[00:07:17.662 --> 00:07:22.707]  And there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[00:07:22.707 --> 00:07:31.655]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[00:07:31.655 --> 00:07:35.579]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:38.401]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[00:07:38.401 --> 00:07:42.465]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine,
[00:07:42.605 --> 00:07:51.291]  That major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[00:07:51.291 --> 00:08:02.219]  It is exclusive to Infowarslife.com and the Infowarslife family of incredible products.
[00:08:02.219 --> 00:08:08.864]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.864 --> 00:08:11.846]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.224 --> 00:08:26.764]  Obama has really been enjoying his Cuban and Central and South American tour.
[00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:30.740]  A state dinner in Buenos Aires.
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:37.802]  He's out there dancing with the legendarily lovely ladies showing off his tango moves.
[00:08:37.802 --> 00:08:40.403]  So it's okay the NSA spying on you illegally.
[00:08:40.403 --> 00:08:43.143]  It's okay he's funding ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[00:08:43.143 --> 00:08:49.726]  It's okay that he sold us out for tens of trillions more in derivatives and banker bailouts.
[00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:50.406]  It's okay
[00:08:51.411 --> 00:09:17.154]  That our country is teetering towards total collapse because you turn on any late night comedy show, you turn on ESPN, you turn on HBO, almost any entertainment film I try to watch, or anytime I'm surfing through cable late at night, maybe once or twice a week, to eat a bowl of ice cream and watch a movie, I am assailed
[00:09:18.123 --> 00:09:19.984]  By Barack Obama.
[00:09:19.984 --> 00:09:21.545]  In entertainment.
[00:09:21.545 --> 00:09:22.705]  That is unprecedented.
[00:09:22.705 --> 00:09:26.727]  That is what Edward Bernays, a hundred years ago, called for.
[00:09:26.727 --> 00:09:32.290]  A fusion of Hollywood with entertainment.
[00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.551]  And the political class.
[00:09:34.551 --> 00:09:36.912]  So that no one could tell the difference.
[00:09:36.912 --> 00:09:41.034]  That's when royalty began to behave like they were the new movie stars as well.
[00:09:41.034 --> 00:09:42.895]  All advised by the man who created
[00:09:43.806 --> 00:09:45.446]  The Department of Defense.
[00:09:45.446 --> 00:09:48.527]  He changed the name in the 40s from the Department of War.
[00:09:48.527 --> 00:10:03.430]  Again, just spinning every word, assaulting reality in every way they can.
[00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:07.811]  Now, continuing with the news here today,
[00:10:09.144 --> 00:10:12.426]  I just want to point out that more and more we are successfully doing this.
[00:10:12.426 --> 00:10:38.522]  I'm shifting somewhat from 100% covering government documents, news items, and developing breaking news to 80% of what we do being covering breaking news and information because most of the public does not get any of their cultural guidance from ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News, CNN, you name it.
[00:10:39.554 --> 00:10:45.075]  They're getting it from the sitcoms, the dramas, the late night comedy shows.
[00:10:45.075 --> 00:10:50.337]  That's where the real indoctrination is going on to the general public.
[00:10:50.337 --> 00:10:56.518]  With young people, it's going on even more hardcore in the government-run schools and the colleges.
[00:10:56.518 --> 00:10:59.359]  As hardcore as the anti-family brainwashing.
[00:11:00.806 --> 00:11:06.507]  is on mainstream television and Nickelodeon and the NFL and the rest of it.
[00:11:06.507 --> 00:11:21.911]  It is nothing compared to the captive audiences at government-run reservations and government-accredited reservations of quote, primary and secondary learning.
[00:11:21.911 --> 00:11:27.032]  And now you see them taking the military, which had been a cult of
[00:11:28.607 --> 00:11:46.725]  Death, a cult of honor, a cult of following orders, a mix of those, a cult of male prowess, a cult of courage, and turning it into a cult of classic Soviet-style brainwashing.
[00:11:46.725 --> 00:11:51.770]  That's why the military, the army makes the men wear red high-heeled shoes, to know what it's like to be a woman.
[00:11:52.981 --> 00:11:58.243]  That's why they are announcing that they will give the Green Beret to women and will lower standards.
[00:11:58.243 --> 00:12:06.246]  And they will give the coveted Navy SEAL trident to women and they will lower standards.
[00:12:06.246 --> 00:12:13.629]  And they will give us movies with Demi Moore, a decade or more before, to condition us and prepare us.
[00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:19.431]  And not to empower the Navy SEALs or Army Special Operations, but to wreck it.
[00:12:20.325 --> 00:12:21.886]  And that is the plan.
[00:12:21.886 --> 00:12:23.227]  That is the design.
[00:12:23.227 --> 00:12:35.856]  They've had top generals, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and others come out in just the last two months and say, we will follow orders, and we will put women in frontline special operations, and it will completely wreck us.
[00:12:35.856 --> 00:12:37.618]  That's the plan.
[00:12:37.618 --> 00:12:45.763]  Then we'll have to accept the drones, the robots, the combat robots, with technicians of men and women,
[00:12:46.787 --> 00:12:48.549]  Miles back running them.
[00:12:48.549 --> 00:12:54.394]  This is how you take humans out of the loop to end the problem of spree decor.
[00:12:54.394 --> 00:13:03.923]  And the more elite troops get, the more they try to follow common sense, common law.
[00:13:03.923 --> 00:13:07.727]  What is the different slogans of special forces groups around the world?
[00:13:07.727 --> 00:13:11.771]  To free the oppressed, to defend the weak, to bring liberty.
[00:13:13.134 --> 00:13:28.797]  Those slogans, just like do no harm with our doctors, 15 years ago, in 2000, every university in the world, globally, state, UN-accredited, under UNESCO, ended the Hippocratic Oath on the same year, 2000.
[00:13:28.797 --> 00:13:33.958]  I guess 16 years ago now.
[00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:41.680]  Worldwide standardization, not to free the oppressed, not to free the weak, not to do no harm, but to heal, but to kill.
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:49.662]  They are taking humanity out of the equation and building, in their own words, a technocracy.
[00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:53.745]  It's why I harp on this.
[00:13:53.745 --> 00:14:03.850]  A technocracy that ends the decision-making process for the average person.
[00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:07.832]  That's why they call it in public schools all over the world, zero tolerance.
[00:14:07.832 --> 00:14:11.454]  You had a toy gun with your Star Wars doll.
[00:14:12.492 --> 00:14:14.193]  The police are taking you to jail.
[00:14:14.193 --> 00:14:17.896]  You're not just suspended.
[00:14:17.896 --> 00:14:21.079]  You had an empty tobacco can in the back of your pickup truck.
[00:14:21.079 --> 00:14:22.180]  We're taking you to jail.
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.361]  Zero tolerance.
[00:14:23.361 --> 00:14:27.184]  The police officers, the teachers, aren't allowed to use their own discretion.
[00:14:27.184 --> 00:14:29.846]  That turns you into a robot.
[00:14:29.846 --> 00:14:32.529]  You said the word mother or father or he or she.
[00:14:32.529 --> 00:14:36.071]  We're suspending you.
[00:14:36.071 --> 00:14:40.015]  All sounds outrageous, but it's meant to be outrageous.
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:47.463]  Because if they can get away with outrageous things, they can get away with anything.
[00:14:47.463 --> 00:14:57.730]  And so, now they feel the word African American is hurtful, so they say, don't use that some places, or don't say black, or don't say this, or don't say that.
[00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:04.234]  It's all meant just to create basket case mental illness.
[00:15:04.234 --> 00:15:10.458]  And that's what they're doing to the military, that's what they're doing to the colleges, the high schools, the middle schools, the elementary schools.
[00:15:11.562 --> 00:15:24.188]  is removing social skills, removing critical thinking, removing basic reading, writing, and arithmetic, and imposing societal collapse programs.
[00:15:24.188 --> 00:15:32.812]  This is a cultural virus on record to terminate the human family as we know it.
[00:15:32.812 --> 00:15:40.155]  That's why humans must come together around men and women being together, around families, around children,
[00:15:42.225 --> 00:15:57.463]  And around basic culture and around gardens and metallurgy, blacksmithing, sewing, all of those activities on record now, release.
[00:15:59.574 --> 00:16:10.603]  Chemicals and triggers in the brain that are good triggers that release basically other deeper instincts that activate your real human programming that God gave you.
[00:16:10.603 --> 00:16:17.249]  And it's that template that is designed to overcome any obstacle.
[00:16:17.249 --> 00:16:24.615]  And everything in the artificial world is about suppressing your normal latent talent.
[00:16:26.348 --> 00:16:53.244]  And taking your instinctive talent for tribalism, or for hunting, and twisting it into new languages, not based on science, but based on a science of engineered basket case mental illness, to be offended by all culture, all symbols, all peoples, including yourself, with a self-loathing of yourself and humanity, to turn off your life force survival instinct.
[00:16:55.572 --> 00:17:14.097]  It is extremely sophisticated, but if you're aware of the enemy programming, if you're aware and have joy and have happiness and have friends and have family that you love and people you lift up, it will shatter that control system.
[00:17:15.663 --> 00:17:18.305]  Now what I'm laying out here is the key to bringing the enemy down.
[00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:20.907]  And Lord knows, I got black circles around my eyes.
[00:17:20.907 --> 00:17:21.768]  I'm exhausted.
[00:17:21.768 --> 00:17:24.810]  I get very sad sometimes having to focus on this.
[00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.272]  I stay in the arena a lot more than most people.
[00:17:27.272 --> 00:17:31.935]  So I have some of the side effects of having to study the enemy constantly.
[00:17:31.935 --> 00:17:33.316]  Don't look too long into the abyss.
[00:17:33.316 --> 00:17:34.577]  Least you become the abyss.
[00:17:34.577 --> 00:17:36.459]  Nietzsche was right again.
[00:17:37.486 --> 00:17:43.569]  But that's what does not kill you, only makes you stronger as well, if you're aware of the larger paradigm.
[00:17:43.569 --> 00:18:04.821]  So when I preach being happy and being joyful and being thankful, and having less screen time, and spending more time with your family, and getting out in nature, and feeling the dirt between your toes, and going and visiting the Amish or the Mennonites, they're around your town, and getting the raw milk, all of it is a journey of a thousand miles, but each step is like 50 miles.
[00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.860]  The journey of a thousand miles does start with a single step, the Chinese proverb.
[00:18:13.951 --> 00:18:21.237]  Once you begin to walk, the first step is a centimeter, the next step is an inch, then a foot, then 50 feet, then 100 miles.
[00:18:21.237 --> 00:18:24.960]  You might get pushed back 50 miles, but the next step is 600 miles.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.702]  Now you've walked 1,000 miles.
[00:18:26.702 --> 00:18:28.363]  Now you're to a new level.
[00:18:28.363 --> 00:18:30.205]  Now a trillion miles lays out.
[00:18:30.205 --> 00:18:32.366]  The first step is a million miles.
[00:18:32.366 --> 00:18:33.968]  The next step is a billion miles.
[00:18:33.968 --> 00:18:40.974]  Before you know it, you've gone trillions of cultural light years from where you were under enemy bombardment.
[00:18:41.874 --> 00:18:48.658]  The first thing they want you to do is to think you're ugly, and that you're fat, and that you're stupid, and that you're pathetic.
[00:18:48.658 --> 00:18:52.180]  And I myself get up here and call the enemy zombies.
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.941]  The trendy, brainwashed, brain-damaged drones.
[00:18:54.941 --> 00:18:56.962]  Horrible, stupid, evil, hateful people.
[00:18:56.962 --> 00:19:00.084]  But you have to understand, they've been programmed and turned into that.
[00:19:00.084 --> 00:19:06.628]  Many of them, from childhood, never became conscious humans, and are literal walking dead.
[00:19:08.072 --> 00:19:12.455]  So I do dislike them at a primitive level because I have to see them as an enemy and defeat them.
[00:19:12.455 --> 00:19:18.018]  They're gone already, so I'm taking my programming and saying, thank you God for this so I don't feel too bad about it.
[00:19:18.018 --> 00:19:19.218]  You are now scum and the enemy.
[00:19:19.218 --> 00:19:20.259]  I'm sorry you're gone.
[00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:22.320]  You're unconscious.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.963]  But for all my hatred of the enemy, I have so much more love for everybody else.
[00:19:26.963 --> 00:19:28.764]  And I understand now why I have hate for them.
[00:19:28.764 --> 00:19:33.206]  God gave it to me so that I don't feel bad when I have to look at them.
[00:19:33.206 --> 00:19:35.327]  Because I'm actually very sad for them.
[00:19:35.327 --> 00:19:36.068]  They're so pathetic.
[00:19:37.056 --> 00:19:41.978]  They're like a lobotomized child with a huge butcher knife attacking us and we just have to stand up to them.
[00:19:41.978 --> 00:19:48.242]  But it's still, it doesn't give me pleasure to see what they've done to our people, what they've turned the human form into.
[00:19:48.242 --> 00:19:52.364]  This is what the enemy wants to do, is mutilate and vandalize humanity.
[00:19:52.364 --> 00:19:56.506]  We got big Donald Trump news coming up here after the break in Concerns Info Wars.
[00:19:56.506 --> 00:19:56.926]  Stay with us.

[00:21:59.036 --> 00:22:03.280]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:03.901]  It's true.
[00:22:03.901 --> 00:22:08.064]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:22:08.064 --> 00:22:10.447]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.

[00:23:55.232 --> 00:23:57.253]  That's fpeusa.org.
[00:24:09.761 --> 00:24:12.723]  Normally comes on about once a week, but he wanted to wait until next Monday.
[00:24:12.723 --> 00:24:26.792]  He's going to be breaking at InfoWars.com exclusive information that he says is basically the biggest, one of the biggest, if not the biggest developments of the campaign.
[00:24:26.792 --> 00:24:32.776]  Major positive developments to report and big bombshells.
[00:24:32.776 --> 00:24:35.578]  So that is coming up on Monday with Roger Stone.
[00:24:35.578 --> 00:24:37.839]  I know that's like five days out still.
[00:24:37.839 --> 00:24:39.080]  That's not the new Trump news.
[00:24:44.298 --> 00:24:47.219]  And the new Trump news is not shocking claims.
[00:24:47.219 --> 00:24:52.720]  Perv Ted Cruz caught cheating with five secret mistresses.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.061]  That's really a mean headline, even for the Inquirer.
[00:24:56.061 --> 00:24:58.481]  He's a perv for being with women?
[00:24:58.481 --> 00:25:02.262]  I guess in the modern world, being heterosexual is perverted, but okay, whatever.
[00:25:02.262 --> 00:25:06.803]  I thought perverted is like getting caught with a... whatever.
[00:25:08.925 --> 00:25:19.036]  But continuing here, the big Donald Trump news is he just tweeted out to his tens of millions of listeners and followers and fans a Alex Jones video.
[00:25:19.036 --> 00:25:24.481]  The same one that Drudge Report linked to a month ago that went viral and got millions of views.
[00:25:24.481 --> 00:25:26.784]  And that was my interview with Roger Stone.
[00:25:26.784 --> 00:25:30.327]  Let's go ahead and put the tweet on screen if we can for TV viewers.
[00:25:30.327 --> 00:25:31.609]  Real Donald J. Trump
[00:25:33.834 --> 00:25:37.596]  And he goes on to say, Cruz and the Republican establishment are scared.
[00:25:37.596 --> 00:25:46.640]  And again, he just retweeted an old video from a month ago that's a YouTube copy of our Facebook mentions from somebody else's page.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:51.943]  Alex Jones, Roger Stone, insider leaks Koch brothers plan to stop Trump.
[00:25:51.943 --> 00:25:54.985]  And a month later, all of that meeting is public.
[00:25:54.985 --> 00:25:56.385]  It's all admitted.
[00:25:56.385 --> 00:26:02.949]  It was all dead on, including that Jeb Bush would endorse Ted Cruz and that he was a sleeper agent.
[00:26:03.823 --> 00:26:05.043]  He said that a month ago?
[00:26:05.043 --> 00:26:06.264]  I think that was more than a month ago.
[00:26:06.264 --> 00:26:07.684]  What's the date on that?
[00:26:07.684 --> 00:26:18.788]  And then, when he was here in town, and then he said it again last Wednesday, and it ended up happening on Wednesday, a week later.
[00:26:18.788 --> 00:26:22.930]  So that's why it's important when Stone comes on the broadcast.
[00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:28.372]  Now that was posted on February 26th, but it happened a couple days before that in our live Facebook mentions.
[00:26:29.997 --> 00:26:30.617]  And it's crazy.
[00:26:30.617 --> 00:26:32.738]  We did in-studio two-hour interview.
[00:26:32.738 --> 00:26:33.839]  We did other big interviews.
[00:26:33.839 --> 00:26:35.380]  And those get big.
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:43.023]  But then I shoot some little Facebook mentions and it's got millions and millions of views and had a big effect thanks to DrudgeReport.com and others linking to it.
[00:26:43.023 --> 00:26:45.965]  But the point is you're getting real intel.
[00:26:47.423 --> 00:26:54.090]  When you come on this broadcast, you're getting hardcore information you're not going to get anywhere else.
[00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:59.596]  And everybody's got to differentiate themselves in media that, hey, we're special, you should tune in here.
[00:26:59.596 --> 00:27:01.238]  But InfoWars really is special.
[00:27:02.227 --> 00:27:05.948]  We really do have our finger on the pulse of what's really happening and really unfolding.
[00:27:05.948 --> 00:27:07.969]  So big news.
[00:27:07.969 --> 00:27:13.311]  I hate to sit on news like this till Monday, but that's what they want to do.
[00:27:13.311 --> 00:27:18.772]  And obviously Stone is somewhat of a surrogate, let's just say, for Trump.
[00:27:18.772 --> 00:27:19.593]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:27:19.593 --> 00:27:21.833]  I think everybody can tell that and knows that.
[00:27:24.574 --> 00:27:28.236]  That's what it comes down to, is that we'll have some big news for you on Monday.
[00:27:28.236 --> 00:27:37.660]  Maybe I can twist his arm until Sunday, but he thinks Monday's when he wants to do that, so stay tuned for that.
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:43.482]  I'm gonna go to break-along segments coming up, and then I'm gonna get into the latest Brussels-Belgium bombing news.
[00:27:43.482 --> 00:27:49.805]  And man, I gotta tell you, I look at the news at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and I just cannot even believe it.
[00:27:52.133 --> 00:27:54.900]  The, uh... How do you say their names?
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.123]  Bach-ar-yee?
[00:27:56.123 --> 00:27:56.604]  Bach-er-wee?
[00:27:58.052 --> 00:28:04.097]  Bakrawi brothers may have planned to blow up Belgium nuclear power plants.
[00:28:04.097 --> 00:28:05.498]  That's one of the stories.
[00:28:05.498 --> 00:28:08.400]  Obviously, they had those on lockdown since it happened two days ago.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.441]  But here's the big one.
[00:28:09.441 --> 00:28:12.543]  Talent agency boss who confronted, she just talked to her.
[00:28:12.543 --> 00:28:14.285]  You're not allowed to have free speech.
[00:28:14.285 --> 00:28:22.331]  You can make her wear a hood on her head, cut her genitals off if you own her under radical Islam, but you don't talk if you're a liberal westerner.
[00:28:23.612 --> 00:28:33.259]  Talent Agency boss who confronted a Muslim woman in London and asked her to explain Brussels, is arrested for inciting racial hatred.
[00:28:33.259 --> 00:28:33.960]  That's right.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:39.524]  A group, a part of a religion, screams Allah Akbar, blows you up, that's okay.
[00:28:39.524 --> 00:28:41.365]  But if you ask about it, you are arrested.
[00:28:41.365 --> 00:28:48.951]  Just like the yoga teacher saw these young Muslims celebrating the attacks, talked about it, police came and got him.
[00:28:48.951 --> 00:28:50.372]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:28:51.736 --> 00:28:53.897]  I'm the immigrant effing your daughter.
[00:28:53.897 --> 00:28:59.618]  That's who Sweden has hired to head up the state-funded institute for the migrants integrating into society.
[00:28:59.618 --> 00:29:05.939]  So he announced in his first official tweet that your daughters belong to us.
[00:29:05.939 --> 00:29:10.020]  And if you criticize, SWAT teams are on the way.
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.140]  Well, cops are on the way.
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:18.642]  If you don't submit and go to jail with them and learn how to get slapped around a little bit, then the SWAT team's coming.
[00:29:20.233 --> 00:29:22.694]  You want to live under leftist total oppression?
[00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:24.615]  You're going to.
[00:29:24.615 --> 00:29:33.420]  And when they're throwing gay people off roofs, I'm telling you, the liberals salute it because they hate themselves, and that's a sacrament.
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.121]  They're into being cuckold, folks.
[00:29:35.121 --> 00:29:39.624]  It's like the guys that like to see their wife with, you know, six guys in bed.
[00:29:39.624 --> 00:29:42.365]  It's a family show, but we have to scientifically describe it.
[00:29:42.365 --> 00:29:42.986]  But it's beyond that.
[00:29:42.986 --> 00:29:48.289]  It's like guys that want to see their wife have her jaw broken, her teeth pulled out with pliers, and their head chopped off.
[00:29:48.871 --> 00:29:52.792]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.792 --> 00:29:59.594]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.594 --> 00:30:09.236]  Ted Cruz ignores the real source of radical Islam, and that is the special relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.
[00:30:09.236 --> 00:30:16.298]  Presidential candidate Ted Cruz sidestepped his proposal to patrol Muslim neighborhoods during an interview with CNN.
[00:30:16.778 --> 00:30:26.867]  If you have a neighborhood where there is a high level of gang activity, the way to prevent it is you increase the law enforcement presence there, and you target the gang members to get them off the street.
[00:30:26.867 --> 00:30:31.752]  I am talking about any area where there is a higher incidence of radical Islamic terrorism.
[00:30:31.752 --> 00:30:34.614]  Cruz completely sidestepped the real issue.
[00:30:34.614 --> 00:30:41.441]  That is the creation, promotion, and support of radical Islamic terrorists by Saudi Arabia and the United States.
[00:30:41.821 --> 00:30:55.848]  As a political opportunist, supported by Goldman Sachs, the CFR, and the establishment, Cruz must embrace the terror war narrative and its lies, delusions, omissions, and misrepresentations of the truth.

[00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:02.713]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[00:33:12.398 --> 00:33:20.900]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:25.262]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:25.262 --> 00:33:29.423]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:33:29.423 --> 00:33:32.003]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.003 --> 00:33:35.805]  You know, that's not fluff building the show up.
[00:33:35.805 --> 00:33:37.305]  In fact, it's pretty scary.
[00:33:38.613 --> 00:33:50.675]  InfoWars is undoubtedly, when it comes to actually fighting the globalists, worldwide, for an independent news agency, the biggest, the strongest, the most informed, the most effective.
[00:33:50.675 --> 00:33:53.796]  And we're small compared to the enemy constellation.
[00:33:53.796 --> 00:33:56.276]  We are ragtag.
[00:33:56.276 --> 00:33:58.656]  We are stumbling through the day half the time.
[00:33:58.656 --> 00:34:01.037]  We're in trouble.
[00:34:01.037 --> 00:34:05.938]  But so many times in history, it's ragtag groups that take on Goliath.
[00:34:05.938 --> 00:34:07.058]  But I'm here to tell you, folks,
[00:34:08.766 --> 00:34:20.332]  There's great sites like Drudge that break through the electronic Berlin Wall and show people the elephant in the room, there's WorldNet Daily, a few others, but it's really up to all of you who understand what's happening, understand the paradigm.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:31.617]  Start your own local news sites, start going out and covering news, start gathering city council information, to start showing what the globalists are doing locally, and people will come to you and you will be a leader.
[00:34:31.617 --> 00:34:35.039]  Really the best way to fight the enemy is to operate as a news agency,
[00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:45.818]  And to have credibility and be focused but not mince words and then form satellite organizations in your area.
[00:34:45.818 --> 00:34:52.424]  Because information is power and war is now based on information.
[00:34:52.424 --> 00:34:54.967]  And the enemy has their frauds, we have the truth.
[00:34:54.967 --> 00:35:02.314]  Can you believe Donald Trump said with all these unvetted Muslims coming in we should stop all immigration until they start vetting them and doing a basic check.
[00:35:03.663 --> 00:35:08.324]  That's like saying, you shouldn't open the portal on the submarine at a thousand feet under the water.
[00:35:08.324 --> 00:35:09.764]  It'll kill everybody.
[00:35:09.764 --> 00:35:12.485]  Donald Trump says, don't open the submarine portal.
[00:35:12.485 --> 00:35:14.385]  And they go, did you hear that psychopath?
[00:35:14.385 --> 00:35:16.446]  He said that nut.
[00:35:16.446 --> 00:35:19.987]  He said, don't pour gasoline on yourself and light it on fire.
[00:35:19.987 --> 00:35:21.927]  Whoa, what will he say next?
[00:35:21.927 --> 00:35:24.107]  Don't take a gun, shove it in your mouth and pull the trigger?
[00:35:24.107 --> 00:35:26.188]  I mean, everybody knows you're supposed to do that.
[00:35:28.854 --> 00:35:31.256]  This is their attempt to overthrow reality.
[00:35:31.256 --> 00:35:32.197]  They know what they're doing.
[00:35:32.197 --> 00:35:35.600]  They want to so confuse people, where the public just goes, I'll give in.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.541]  I won't say mother or father, boy or girl.
[00:35:37.541 --> 00:35:38.983]  I'll dress however you say.
[00:35:38.983 --> 00:35:40.064]  I'll talk like you say.
[00:35:40.064 --> 00:35:41.765]  I'll eat GMO.
[00:35:41.765 --> 00:35:43.286]  I'll take all the shots.
[00:35:43.286 --> 00:35:44.007]  I love you.
[00:35:44.007 --> 00:35:46.909]  I'll do whatever you say.
[00:35:46.909 --> 00:35:50.933]  Just give me some good drugs, you know, while I die of brain damage so I don't feel the pain.
[00:35:50.933 --> 00:35:53.255]  The government's like, absolutely, we're getting euthanasia ready for you.
[00:35:54.727 --> 00:35:56.327]  Soylent Green's made out of people.
[00:35:56.327 --> 00:35:58.148]  Yeah, we heat the hospitals with dead babies.
[00:35:58.148 --> 00:36:00.349]  Yeah, we sell the baby parts for cosmetics.
[00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:02.569]  Yeah, we keep them alive and harvest their organs.
[00:36:02.569 --> 00:36:03.670]  Big deal.
[00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:07.711]  Everything we told you about 10, 15, 20 years ago, mainstream now.
[00:36:07.711 --> 00:36:16.133]  Yeah, there's chimeras all over the United States and all over the world, part human, part animal, growing inside cows, sheep, and pigs, and we're selling their organs.
[00:36:16.133 --> 00:36:18.674]  Big deal.
[00:36:18.674 --> 00:36:19.294]  It's a big deal.
[00:36:21.058 --> 00:36:28.896]  I was talking to a family member the other day and they were talking about chimeras and how it was finally in the news and somebody walked over to them and said they were crazy.
[00:36:30.538 --> 00:36:32.360]  That's been around at least 30 years.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.161]  These people, these people.
[00:36:34.161 --> 00:36:35.603]  I mean, there it is, MIT.
[00:36:35.603 --> 00:36:38.205]  Human animal chimeras are gestating on U.S.
[00:36:38.205 --> 00:36:39.766]  research farms.
[00:36:39.766 --> 00:36:52.098]  And they had a bunch of articles a few weeks ago, a White House-run group put out one, and everybody in the media copied it and said, Jones is crazy and claims humanoid clones are growing in cows, and that space aliens run it.
[00:36:52.887 --> 00:36:56.769]  No, I said Chris Carter, you know, thinks it's space aliens, I guess.
[00:36:56.769 --> 00:36:57.570]  And I said, who knows?
[00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:58.590]  It might as well be alien.
[00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:00.331]  These people act like they want to destroy the planet.
[00:37:00.331 --> 00:37:04.654]  You know, the Bible says it's the devil, fallen angel from space.
[00:37:04.654 --> 00:37:08.476]  So I guess Christian cosmology is like science fiction.
[00:37:08.476 --> 00:37:09.756]  Who knows?
[00:37:09.756 --> 00:37:11.898]  And they've got scores of articles.
[00:37:11.898 --> 00:37:13.659]  Jones has gone nuts.
[00:37:13.659 --> 00:37:16.060]  Says the devil is an alien and runs the world.
[00:37:17.585 --> 00:37:19.286]  We're just stating what's in the Bible.
[00:37:19.286 --> 00:37:20.886]  I don't know what's going on.
[00:37:20.886 --> 00:37:28.928]  I just know the elite are re-engineering the entire world, creating all these abominations that don't even work right and are all screwed up.
[00:37:28.928 --> 00:37:35.030]  And they're poisoning everything while hopping around telling us they're saving the world.
[00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.411]  That's all I know.
[00:37:36.411 --> 00:37:39.732]  And then putting people in charge everywhere.
[00:37:39.732 --> 00:37:41.032]  Paul's got to write another article.
[00:37:41.032 --> 00:37:42.312]  He's incredible.
[00:37:42.312 --> 00:37:44.373]  But he always writes it on one issue.
[00:37:45.404 --> 00:37:46.745]  Which is important.
[00:37:46.745 --> 00:37:59.029]  But I remember at least 30 articles the last year where the head of the Sweden immigrant group joins ISIS and wants to overthrow the government and the government keeps them there.
[00:37:59.029 --> 00:38:06.572]  Or head of immigrant group, you know, tells German women, you must supply sex to us.
[00:38:06.572 --> 00:38:10.014]  And then the German government says, yes, that's a nice thing to do.
[00:38:10.014 --> 00:38:12.955]  You know, or the mayor says, don't wear short skirts.
[00:38:12.955 --> 00:38:14.055]  It's your fault.
[00:38:14.055 --> 00:38:15.016]  You know, behave yourself.
[00:38:16.445 --> 00:38:20.949]  Because this is by plan to break our will.
[00:38:20.949 --> 00:38:23.332]  I mean, look at this.
[00:38:23.332 --> 00:38:31.680]  A talent agency head sees some women wearing beekeeper suits, Halloween outfits, and they got their faces covered up.
[00:38:34.093 --> 00:38:37.054]  Like we're in Saudi Arabia and you go, oh be nice, be open.
[00:38:37.054 --> 00:38:41.675]  If I go to Saudi Arabia and walk down the street with my wife without a headdress on, they'll kill me.
[00:38:41.675 --> 00:38:45.596]  If you teach the Bible one time, they'll put you in prison for 10 years.
[00:38:45.596 --> 00:38:47.236]  The second time, they'll execute you.
[00:38:47.236 --> 00:38:53.298]  Where's the tolerance there, you filthy fascist scumbag liberals allied with radical Islam?
[00:38:53.578 --> 00:38:59.542]  You people are filth, and you know it, and you love it, and you cozy up to it, because you're not really liberals.
[00:38:59.542 --> 00:39:04.385]  You are fascist takeover criminal pirates who know full well what you're doing.
[00:39:04.385 --> 00:39:08.888]  You are piratical, lazy, criminal dirtbags.
[00:39:12.714 --> 00:39:21.278]  Talent agency boss who confronted a Muslim woman in London and asked her to explain Brussels is arrested for inciting racial hatred.
[00:39:21.278 --> 00:39:25.100]  You guys give me the full Daily Mail article because I only got the front page, sorry.
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:33.204]  A PR boss who asked a Muslim woman to explain Brussels, just explain Brussels, just free speech, you can say that, has been arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred.
[00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:34.464]  That's right.
[00:39:34.464 --> 00:39:36.585]  He's been arrested for free speech in 1984 by the Ministry of Love.
[00:39:39.795 --> 00:39:56.107]  Matthew Doyle, an LSE alum and partner at South London-based Talon Agency, sparked outrage by the social justice warriors at Twitter and Facebook that are controlled after he confronted a Muslim woman about the Brussels attack which killed 34 people.
[00:39:56.107 --> 00:39:58.229]  Those were hors d'oeuvres to be blown up.
[00:39:58.229 --> 00:40:03.093]  He wrote on Twitter in front of a Muslim woman in Crichton yesterday and asked her to explain Brussels.
[00:40:03.093 --> 00:40:05.655]  She said, nothing to do with me.
[00:40:06.932 --> 00:40:08.252]  A kneeling mouth reply.
[00:40:08.252 --> 00:40:10.013]  Yeah, never I decry that.
[00:40:10.013 --> 00:40:13.794]  I'm against that.
[00:40:13.794 --> 00:40:14.955]  Then there were a bunch of other tweets.
[00:40:14.955 --> 00:40:16.555]  No more Muslim immigration.
[00:40:16.555 --> 00:40:17.636]  Trump for president.
[00:40:17.636 --> 00:40:23.938]  And so here come the police to intimidate free speech in the birthplace of Magna Carta run by a bunch of criminals now.
[00:40:25.922 --> 00:40:27.502]  Shame on you, collaborators!
[00:40:27.502 --> 00:40:28.463]  Shame on you!
[00:40:28.463 --> 00:40:39.965]  You won't stand up for free speech in England, but you love Saudi Arabia murdering Christians and chopping their heads off, like you'd chop a chicken's head off, and funding ISIS to go in and murder en masse.
[00:40:39.965 --> 00:40:48.847]  And then another arrogant, mutated, politically Islamic radical fused in with liberal trendiness.
[00:40:48.847 --> 00:40:50.608]  Look at this.
[00:40:50.608 --> 00:40:52.328]  I'm the immigrant effing your daughter.
[00:40:53.979 --> 00:41:01.745]  The state-backed Swedish Institute hands control of Twitter account to Lebanese migrant.
[00:41:01.745 --> 00:41:08.591]  The state-backed Swedish Institute handed control of official Twitter account to Lebanese migrant who then proceeded to tweet on it.
[00:41:08.591 --> 00:41:15.656]  I'm the immigrant effing your daughter while you're trying to sleep ignoring her moans calling me daddy.
[00:41:15.656 --> 00:41:17.618]  Build as a new Swede every week.
[00:41:18.658 --> 00:41:21.279]  Oh yeah, because you're... I love it when Muslims kill somebody.
[00:41:21.279 --> 00:41:23.720]  It's a German, a Swede, you know, they did it.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:32.625]  The Twitter account rotates between different individuals tweet about life in Sweden under the umbrella of the Curators of Sweden project.
[00:41:32.625 --> 00:41:39.108]  The Swedish Institute itself is partly taxpayer-funded body which says its mission is promote Sweden and Swedish issues globally.
[00:41:39.108 --> 00:41:41.369]  And then they set that up now.
[00:41:41.369 --> 00:41:42.349]  I'll see on CNN.
[00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:47.892]  Let's look at the art of Germany or France and it's like anything but German.
[00:41:50.808 --> 00:41:55.449]  It's cultural suicide.
[00:41:55.449 --> 00:41:57.530]  Now let's continue.
[00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:03.392]  No borders activist welcomed Brussels attack as a good thing.
[00:42:03.392 --> 00:42:04.752]  A good thing.
[00:42:04.752 --> 00:42:05.713]  Go read about that.
[00:42:05.713 --> 00:42:07.793]  That's on Infowars.com.
[00:42:07.793 --> 00:42:10.214]  The View host admit Trump was right about Brussels.
[00:42:10.214 --> 00:42:11.274]  I can't believe it.
[00:42:11.274 --> 00:42:12.755]  He seems reasonable.
[00:42:14.861 --> 00:42:15.945]  Yeah, in the full clip.
[00:42:15.945 --> 00:42:20.982]  If you're not vetting anybody, and they stop vetting and even looking at IDs, we have to do this, which is in the news.
[00:42:22.634 --> 00:42:30.797]  Dozens of college students in fear, close quote, in Atlanta after Trump 2016 chocked across campus.
[00:42:30.797 --> 00:42:33.358]  Not Trump KKK, which the false flaggers do.
[00:42:33.358 --> 00:42:34.278]  No, no, no.
[00:42:34.278 --> 00:42:43.362]  Trump 2016 and they're now having psychologists in meetings and having to cancel part of the school as everyone goes in and says, we're scared!
[00:42:43.362 --> 00:42:47.183]  We're so much robbed!
[00:42:47.183 --> 00:42:48.224]  It was almost as bad as Yale.
[00:42:49.972 --> 00:42:58.920]  Last year, and then again this year, but last year, they fired him this year, where they were calling for all costume parties to be banned, period!
[00:43:00.071 --> 00:43:01.472]  And for a dress code to be in!
[00:43:01.472 --> 00:43:04.434]  If we're so liberal, dress like we say!
[00:43:04.434 --> 00:43:06.576]  We're not an acculturing thing!
[00:43:06.576 --> 00:43:11.800]  And then the two professors over that department sent an email saying, listen, costume parties are part of freedom.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.061]  This is true liberalism.
[00:43:13.061 --> 00:43:18.745]  You're allowed to, you know, have different ideas and dress like you want and just, you know, you have your freedom as well.
[00:43:18.745 --> 00:43:22.808]  And so they caught him out in the square and began screaming at him and threatening him and threatening to hit him and going,
[00:43:23.528 --> 00:43:24.609]  Help me!
[00:43:24.609 --> 00:43:25.549]  I'm scared!
[00:43:25.549 --> 00:43:26.570]  I'm not safe!
[00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.270]  Oh my gosh, you're hurting me!
[00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:32.092]  I mean, I can't even scream as loud and as hysterically and as freaked out as they did.
[00:43:32.092 --> 00:43:32.552]  And guess what?
[00:43:32.552 --> 00:43:34.573]  Yale fired both of them.
[00:43:34.573 --> 00:43:38.215]  Fired the people that dare say there was freedom.
[00:43:38.215 --> 00:43:42.137]  Because you think it's crazy that they got a guy up there running something saying, your daughter's mine.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:47.741]  I've got the Imam of Jerusalem on TV going, we are coming to America and Europe.
[00:43:47.741 --> 00:43:48.462]  You are weak.
[00:43:48.462 --> 00:43:49.602]  Europeans are weak.
[00:43:49.602 --> 00:43:50.942]  We will take your daughters.
[00:43:50.942 --> 00:43:53.523]  We will rule you now.
[00:43:53.523 --> 00:43:58.885]  Like out of a movie, like out of the Blues Brothers, where they go, how much for your life?
[00:43:58.885 --> 00:44:02.726]  How much for the little?
[00:44:02.726 --> 00:44:06.247]  I mean, this is what's just the frothing.
[00:44:06.247 --> 00:44:07.227]  You have no instinct.
[00:44:07.227 --> 00:44:08.268]  You have no will.
[00:44:08.268 --> 00:44:09.488]  You have no strength.
[00:44:09.488 --> 00:44:10.568]  You have no culture.
[00:44:10.568 --> 00:44:11.629]  We're going to eat you.
[00:44:12.529 --> 00:44:16.731]  Like a piece of steak on a shish kebab!
[00:44:16.731 --> 00:44:18.072]  You slaves!
[00:44:18.072 --> 00:44:19.973]  We're coming to take your women!
[00:44:19.973 --> 00:44:21.673]  Nothing will stop us!
[00:44:21.673 --> 00:44:23.334]  We're gonna kill you too!
[00:44:23.334 --> 00:44:24.935]  We're gonna beat your brains out!
[00:44:24.935 --> 00:44:26.496]  We're gonna jihad all of you!
[00:44:26.496 --> 00:44:29.937]  And they're not even the Wahhabis with the headdresses on!
[00:44:29.937 --> 00:44:31.698]  They're wearing like gangster shirts!
[00:44:31.698 --> 00:44:37.181]  It's like mutated into weaponized CIA Hollywood garbage!
[00:44:37.181 --> 00:44:39.942]  Islam is coming and your daughters will wear the hijab!
[00:44:42.796 --> 00:44:59.508]  And again, this is done for cultural clash and to make sure the radical Muslims are accepted and they can dominate the Jordanians, the Iraqis, some of the Shiite groups, some of the Alawites that are not radical and have a history of freedom.
[00:44:59.508 --> 00:45:06.514]  Our governments are overthrowing secular governments and putting the worst radicals, run out of Saudi Arabia you can.
[00:45:06.514 --> 00:45:08.595]  That's the enemy attack.
[00:45:08.595 --> 00:45:10.937]  And when they blow stuff up and shoot people up,
[00:45:11.954 --> 00:45:25.144]  They're going to take our freedoms as they've announced, Viper teams at bus stations, train stations, malls, searching everyone while the borders open and they fly planes in and don't even check their IDs.
[00:45:25.144 --> 00:45:27.806]  You see how that works?
[00:45:27.806 --> 00:45:32.030]  Now the police don't like what's happening, even the feds know what's happening and think it's wrong.
[00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:37.374]  But it doesn't matter because we're all directed by the criminal bureaucracy that is so arrogant
[00:45:39.443 --> 00:45:45.286]  It's saying we'll appoint Hillary if Bernie meets her and we'll appoint somebody else if Trump's the nominee.
[00:45:45.286 --> 00:45:47.807]  We just won't let him have it.
[00:45:47.807 --> 00:46:04.715]  This is outside criminal groups that have hijacked everything and are now admitting it to you and admitting they're preparing for a purge of veterans, returning veterans, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, libertarians and others.
[00:46:04.715 --> 00:46:07.416]  They're taking over and they're bringing in their muscle.
[00:46:08.459 --> 00:46:20.225]  They're bringing in combat veterans by the millions into Europe and the hundreds of thousands from the Syria affair, trained in Qatar, trained in Saudi Arabia, trained sleeper cells.
[00:46:20.225 --> 00:46:22.306]  The military, by the way, knows this.
[00:46:22.306 --> 00:46:25.468]  And you know I've got top military contacts on and off the record.
[00:46:25.468 --> 00:46:26.348]  They have confirmed.
[00:46:26.348 --> 00:46:27.969]  They said, no, it's true.
[00:46:27.969 --> 00:46:30.771]  And we're going to be ordered to stand down during all this, and we're not going to do it.
[00:46:31.411 --> 00:46:43.433]  Do you understand that the people running the government are going to give the addresses of combat and special forces veterans to these Muslim groups when they activate them to wipe them out?
[00:46:43.433 --> 00:46:45.413]  I cannot believe how bold the globalists are.
[00:46:45.413 --> 00:46:46.094]  But you know what?
[00:46:46.094 --> 00:46:49.554]  We deserve it because we've been so gullible.
[00:46:49.554 --> 00:46:51.634]  I cannot believe it.
[00:46:51.634 --> 00:47:00.336]  For two years, the FBI and federal marshals tried to stop the San Bernardino shooters and were investigated and almost charged with civil rights violations for investigating those two.
[00:47:01.701 --> 00:47:04.805]  The sleeper cells are being given new identities.
[00:47:04.805 --> 00:47:07.988]  They're not even being given Middle Eastern or Arabic identities.
[00:47:07.988 --> 00:47:14.856]  They're being given new fake names and covers by the feds as we speak in every major city.
[00:47:14.856 --> 00:47:16.278]  We have a report coming next week.
[00:47:16.278 --> 00:47:17.519]  Just wait.
[00:47:17.519 --> 00:47:18.961]  It's in the news, but we have
[00:47:21.252 --> 00:47:22.233]  Oh, it's all just over the top.
[00:47:22.233 --> 00:47:25.634]  I can't believe my life is... InfoWars is insane.
[00:47:25.634 --> 00:47:27.675]  You ought to be behind the scenes here, folks.
[00:47:27.675 --> 00:47:28.716]  You ought to see it for yourself.
[00:47:28.716 --> 00:47:30.877]  This country is being completely set up.
[00:47:30.877 --> 00:47:35.580]  God help us that this country awakened.
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:43.264]  The elite ran America, helped set up a world empire with it, and now they're getting ready to fully gut it and bring it down as a trophy to mount on the wall.
[00:47:43.264 --> 00:47:45.465]  The globalists hate Christians.
[00:47:45.465 --> 00:47:49.547]  If you even have a Christian family and background, they want to kill you.
[00:47:50.865 --> 00:47:52.226]  You're bitter clingers.
[00:47:52.226 --> 00:47:54.367]  They hate you.
[00:47:54.367 --> 00:48:00.150]  The only way you can get out of this is to join them and hurt innocent people, and nobody's going to do that.
[00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:08.454]  And they've taken our restraint and the fact that they're operations so over-the-top for weakness.
[00:48:08.454 --> 00:48:09.655]  And maybe, maybe we are weak.
[00:48:09.655 --> 00:48:15.958]  Maybe we deserve to have to hand our daughters and our families over to people that say they own us.
[00:48:15.958 --> 00:48:19.720]  Maybe this is our self-loathing and our hatred and we will become a third world hell pit.
[00:48:21.624 --> 00:48:26.865]  I mean, you know, even Lou Rockwell came out and Pat Buchanan said the West is now committing suicide in front of our eyes.
[00:48:26.865 --> 00:48:37.168]  This, this is, the leadership that runs things is diabolical and evil and exempts themselves from everything they do to us.
[00:48:37.168 --> 00:48:42.130]  Pastor Manning's coming up, I think he's already hosting the fourth hour.
[00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:48.171]  Before I go any further, this is some really important information, so please listen very, very intently because it's a big deal.
[00:48:48.171 --> 00:48:50.512]  Most people don't do the full deep cleanse.
[00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:55.714]  And they don't do the apple cider vinegar and all the rest of it, the six day cleanse.
[00:48:55.714 --> 00:48:56.935]  That is super dramatic.
[00:48:56.935 --> 00:49:07.746]  A lot of folks just do the liver shield and they also do the deep cleanse, which is a totally separate product that detoxifies and draws so much garbage out of the body.
[00:49:07.746 --> 00:49:11.370]  And with all the things we're being hit by and all the poisons and all the rest of it,
[00:49:12.714 --> 00:49:16.795]  It's now more important than ever to chelate and detoxify.
[00:49:16.795 --> 00:49:22.537]  You can get Deep Cleanse by itself for 10% off at Infowarslife.com right now through the weekend.

[00:49:31.099 --> 00:49:35.980]  And we keep selling out for weeks and months at a time because it's so hard to procure the organic.
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.200]  We're good to go.

[00:50:02.133 --> 00:50:09.459]  I should do a whole show just on this Himalayan slash, we've got two places, Russian Shilajit.
[00:50:09.459 --> 00:50:15.263]  But there's just thousands of different plants over thousands of years that ooze together into the rock and then comes out like oil.
[00:50:17.301 --> 00:50:18.702]  That is biological.
[00:50:18.702 --> 00:50:22.525]  Most oil is abiotic, but some of it is actually biological in nature.
[00:50:22.525 --> 00:50:23.806]  And this is what Shilajit is.
[00:50:23.806 --> 00:50:27.129]  But it's an organic, super essential oil.
[00:50:27.129 --> 00:50:28.089]  Indescribable.
[00:50:28.089 --> 00:50:30.291]  For the Russian athletes, one of their big secrets.
[00:50:30.291 --> 00:50:31.492]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:50:31.492 --> 00:50:35.095]  Get 20% off if you get it with a liver shield and oxy powder together.
[00:50:36.223 --> 00:50:42.466]  Liver Shield 10% off by itself as well, or 15% when you get it with the Deep Cleanse.
[00:50:42.466 --> 00:50:47.208]  But you can just put Deep Cleanse and Liver Shield for a couple of weeks or whenever you want in water and drink it.
[00:50:47.208 --> 00:50:48.048]  It tastes pretty good.
[00:50:48.048 --> 00:50:49.709]  Doesn't taste great.
[00:50:49.709 --> 00:50:53.150]  And you can see big effects there by itself as well.
[00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:54.551]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:56.771]  Your purchase makes this whole operation possible.

[00:51:30.607 --> 00:51:32.428]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:51:32.428 --> 00:51:34.069]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:03.392]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[00:52:03.392 --> 00:52:09.574]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[00:52:09.574 --> 00:52:11.334]  How is this even possible?
[00:52:11.334 --> 00:52:18.897]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[00:52:18.897 --> 00:52:26.640]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:31.202]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[00:52:31.202 --> 00:52:39.987]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[00:52:39.987 --> 00:52:41.568]  But you must act fast.
[00:52:41.568 --> 00:52:46.091]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard, our supply is extremely limited right now.
[00:52:46.451 --> 00:52:49.212]  Claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens.

[00:54:02.449 --> 00:54:07.894]  Michel Maudry-Kainem is the leader of the People's Party in Belgium.
[00:54:07.894 --> 00:54:10.096]  Alex Jones back live.
[00:54:10.096 --> 00:54:20.865]  Michel Maudry-Kainem published a video on Facebook on March 11th, 11 days before the ISIS Brussels bombings on March 22nd.
[00:54:20.865 --> 00:54:23.607]  He warned America not to become Brussels.
[00:54:23.607 --> 00:54:28.932]  He says Brussels is now a third world city after years of Islamist invasion of Europe.
[00:54:32.553 --> 00:54:42.162]  And again, folks, a lot of third world populations do improve your city when you bring in a big group of people.
[00:54:42.162 --> 00:54:42.943]  They've got energy.
[00:54:42.943 --> 00:54:45.145]  They want to work hard.
[00:54:45.145 --> 00:54:48.428]  They bring food, their cultures, clothing.
[00:54:48.428 --> 00:54:51.111]  It enriches.
[00:54:51.111 --> 00:54:53.733]  That's the fun part about New York City, all the great different areas you can go to.
[00:54:53.733 --> 00:54:54.174]  It's fun.
[00:54:55.216 --> 00:54:59.399]  But the cultures work together and they share all this great fusion food.
[00:54:59.399 --> 00:55:01.541]  They're like Chinese with southern cooking.
[00:55:01.541 --> 00:55:04.463]  I mean, it's wild.
[00:55:04.463 --> 00:55:06.864]  But no, that's not what happens.
[00:55:06.864 --> 00:55:13.349]  Islam is run by Wahhabis who are the most extreme people you can imagine and basically imprison everybody.
[00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:15.951]  It's a death cult.
[00:55:15.951 --> 00:55:19.754]  And they're allied with the left and the Saudi Arabians basically own our governments.
[00:55:21.803 --> 00:55:23.124]  And they have total disdain.
[00:55:23.124 --> 00:55:31.131]  When one of the kings comes to France, they'll shut down 10 miles of populated beach so he doesn't have to look at people.
[00:55:31.131 --> 00:55:33.994]  They rule us, just like the filthy British crown.
[00:55:33.994 --> 00:55:35.675]  All of them.
[00:55:35.675 --> 00:55:37.197]  It's unbelievable.
[00:55:37.197 --> 00:55:39.038]  It's pathetic.
[00:55:39.038 --> 00:55:42.942]  But this is political correctness.
[00:55:42.942 --> 00:55:48.247]  And you've got the latest, you know, the new king lecturing us in the news and lecturing Donald Trump.
[00:55:50.216 --> 00:55:52.058]  You're not my king.
[00:55:52.058 --> 00:56:02.126]  You are the fourth generation, third generation of bandits that robbed people in the desert for thousands of years.
[00:56:02.126 --> 00:56:04.989]  You're sex slavers.
[00:56:04.989 --> 00:56:06.390]  That's what your family made money in.
[00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:08.492]  That's who you are.
[00:56:08.492 --> 00:56:12.155]  So of course you've adopted a brand of Islam where women are slaves.
[00:56:12.155 --> 00:56:15.157]  I mean, you are literally the filth of earth.
[00:56:16.888 --> 00:56:18.969]  I just, you're not my God!
[00:56:18.969 --> 00:56:20.889]  No, I will break the political correctness!
[00:56:20.889 --> 00:56:23.970]  I am not for pouring acid on little girls' faces!
[00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:24.970]  Filth!
[00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:29.892]  Go to hell where you came from!
[00:56:29.892 --> 00:56:33.933]  And anyone else hating and abetting the enemy will be brought to justice, understand that.
[00:56:33.933 --> 00:56:40.774]  I'm sorry, let's go to this leader of this party, warning two weeks before the attacks, here it is.
[00:56:40.774 --> 00:56:42.635]  I fully support Donald Trump.
[00:56:44.031 --> 00:56:46.612]  I am not a professional politician.
[00:56:46.612 --> 00:56:53.936]  And I also want to restart, to reset our corrupt and inefficient political system here.
[00:56:53.936 --> 00:56:58.818]  America should not become another Brussels.
[00:56:58.818 --> 00:57:04.841]  It was once a vibrant, entrepreneurial, joyful, peaceful city.
[00:57:04.841 --> 00:57:08.443]  That was before.
[00:57:08.443 --> 00:57:10.924]  Brussels is becoming a third world city.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:21.724]  With a majority of Muslim migrants within 15 to 20 years, according to demographic studies.
[00:57:21.724 --> 00:57:31.047]  But more than half of them have strong Islamist beliefs, as well as anti-Semitic prejudice.
[00:57:31.047 --> 00:57:40.671]  And this situation, already worrying, is aggravated by the current migrant crisis, with the invasion of Europe
[00:57:41.385 --> 00:57:47.930]  That our European leaders failed so far to prevent.
[00:57:47.930 --> 00:58:04.021]  The atheists that have killed a few months ago 130 innocent people in Paris and wounded many more came out of them from Brussels.
[00:58:04.021 --> 00:58:07.303]  Mr. Trump, we have this in common.
[00:58:07.303 --> 00:58:08.664]  We speak the truth.
[00:58:09.804 --> 00:58:12.605]  We name things.
[00:58:12.605 --> 00:58:20.487]  Of course, the political and media elites will never forgive us for that.
[00:58:20.487 --> 00:58:27.710]  But ordinary citizens, the voiceless, are not fooled or abused.
[00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:31.611]  Mr. Trump, make America great again.
[00:58:31.611 --> 00:58:32.531]  We'll be back.
[00:58:32.531 --> 00:58:34.112]  We'll be back with jihadist threatening.
[00:58:34.112 --> 00:58:34.492]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.031 --> 00:58:44.439]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.439 --> 00:58:46.644]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.586 --> 00:58:50.227]  Uh, yeah.
[00:58:50.227 --> 00:58:56.050]  First of all, I want to say, Secret 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:57.011]  I use them all.
[00:58:57.011 --> 00:58:57.991]  They're phenomenal.
[00:58:57.991 --> 00:58:58.732]  They work.
[00:58:58.732 --> 00:58:59.572]  Buy them, folks.
[00:58:59.572 --> 00:59:00.052]  Thank you, brother.
[00:59:00.052 --> 00:59:01.974]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[00:59:01.974 --> 00:59:08.217]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[00:59:08.217 --> 00:59:10.199]  Welcome to the Info War.
[00:59:10.199 --> 00:59:15.602]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Info War at the same time.
[00:59:15.902 --> 00:59:16.763]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[00:59:16.763 --> 00:59:20.526]  I buy all the Nutraceuticals, Tosco FX, Nascent Iodine.
[00:59:20.526 --> 00:59:21.447]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:59:21.447 --> 00:59:22.468]  Have they worked for you?
[00:59:22.468 --> 00:59:25.350]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:26.712]  What products are you taking?
[00:59:26.712 --> 00:59:34.719]  Everything from Super Male to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA Force.
[00:59:34.719 --> 00:59:38.222]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofilth.
[00:59:38.342 --> 00:59:43.388]  Visit Infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[00:59:43.388 --> 00:59:45.711]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:45.711 --> 00:59:47.613]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:06.087]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:06.087 --> 01:00:08.708]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:08.708 --> 01:00:18.235]  By the way, Joe Biggs has sent me a text telling me about this.
[01:00:18.235 --> 01:00:20.637]  We're going to call him to show about it.
[01:00:20.637 --> 01:00:23.959]  He's got the flu and pneumonia.
[01:00:23.959 --> 01:00:29.443]  He's had all sorts of lung issues because he was in an armored vehicle that was on fire and it took him a while, like 15 minutes to get him out.
[01:00:30.515 --> 01:00:35.557]  So he coughs up a lot of blood and still the VA won't help him and they won't even fill his prescription.
[01:00:35.557 --> 01:00:38.939]  Somebody go over to Biggs' house and go get him and take him to the doctor.
[01:00:38.939 --> 01:00:42.760]  And, uh, I'll pay for it just because the VA's not doing it.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.681]  Somebody go get him before he ends up getting sicker.
[01:00:44.681 --> 01:00:46.762]  I know he's been sick for two days.
[01:00:46.762 --> 01:00:50.604]  Somebody, dude, pick somebody from the office to go get, go get Biggs and take him to the doctor.
[01:00:51.994 --> 01:00:53.195]  Might as well shoot a story about it.
[01:00:53.195 --> 01:00:54.216]  I know that's what he wants to do.
[01:00:54.216 --> 01:00:56.477]  He's always complaining about the VA.
[01:00:56.477 --> 01:00:58.959]  He's been there probably 20 times since he moved to Austin.
[01:00:58.959 --> 01:01:00.400]  They always say they lost his paperwork.
[01:01:02.099 --> 01:01:05.902]  He's honorably discharged, purple hearts, full nine yards.
[01:01:05.902 --> 01:01:11.726]  You know, he's got shrapnel wounds all over him, been blown up in vehicles, legs all broken, arms, you name it.
[01:01:11.726 --> 01:01:13.327]  And they wanted to fix his knee.
[01:01:13.327 --> 01:01:16.229]  And I'm just so tired of it.
[01:01:16.229 --> 01:01:18.090]  I'm always like, where does he get insurance?
[01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:20.972]  No, they're supposed to pay for it, and they don't give him anything.
[01:01:20.972 --> 01:01:23.393]  They have these big giant buildings, though.
[01:01:23.393 --> 01:01:28.337]  I'm not blaming the average even VA person, but the death panels, the don't treat list, I'm so tired of it.
[01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:30.939]  Did somebody come in here and wave at the door?
[01:01:30.939 --> 01:01:33.240]  Just let me know somebody's going to do it.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:36.241]  I know him and McBrain are friends.
[01:01:36.241 --> 01:01:37.481]  Send McBrain with a camera, too.
[01:01:37.481 --> 01:01:39.962]  Let's go show what's going on and go show the VA.
[01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:44.203]  We first came to the doctor getting better, but I mean, that's a dramatic show of him not getting treatment.
[01:01:44.203 --> 01:01:47.904]  You can even call him, maybe even go in again after he gets some medicine.
[01:01:47.904 --> 01:01:49.484]  But this is the type of garbage I'm talking about.
[01:01:49.484 --> 01:01:52.325]  And those two are friends, or Jakari, whoever.
[01:01:52.325 --> 01:01:56.206]  I wish he'd get them over there and get Biggs at the hospital or to the clinic.
[01:01:56.206 --> 01:01:57.066]  This is just ridiculous.
[01:01:59.875 --> 01:02:01.115]  Well, I have the flu and pneumonia.
[01:02:01.115 --> 01:02:06.517]  The VA wouldn't fill my prescription even though they said I am in the system and recognized as a VA patient.
[01:02:06.517 --> 01:02:11.979]  They said I needed to go to eligibility and get an appointment for later with a doctor so they could get an ER.
[01:02:11.979 --> 01:02:13.859]  Did last night.
[01:02:13.859 --> 01:02:16.620]  By then my lungs would be so full of liquid.
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:17.000]  Liquid.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.742]  So they essentially said F off and have to wait for an appointment later on.
[01:02:21.742 --> 01:02:22.622]  Not today.
[01:02:22.622 --> 01:02:23.823]  Like in a week.
[01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:25.843]  Good thing pneumonia isn't one of those bad things.
[01:02:25.843 --> 01:02:27.504]  Seems sarcastic.
[01:02:27.504 --> 01:02:27.844]  And, um...
[01:02:28.993 --> 01:02:32.815]  So we're going to document what's happening to Biggs because I was already talking to him last night.
[01:02:32.815 --> 01:02:33.336]  He was so mad.
[01:02:33.336 --> 01:02:35.277]  I wanted to do a report about it when he gets better.
[01:02:35.277 --> 01:02:36.737]  So that's how I can speak for him.
[01:02:36.737 --> 01:02:37.678]  That's what he wants to do.
[01:02:37.678 --> 01:02:39.619]  So let's go make sure he's getting better.
[01:02:39.619 --> 01:02:43.661]  I didn't know he went to the ER last night after I talked to him at like midnight.
[01:02:43.661 --> 01:02:44.602]  I didn't know he was that sick.
[01:02:44.602 --> 01:02:46.063]  So pray for Joe Biggs.
[01:02:46.063 --> 01:02:51.806]  What an insane example of how we're bringing in all these jihadis.
[01:02:51.806 --> 01:02:58.070]  We're bringing all these people from war-torn areas where our own government financed the overthrow or the attempted overthrow of Libya and Syria.
[01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:04.316]  Overthrew our allies, destabilized the whole region, religious freedom, you name it.
[01:03:04.316 --> 01:03:07.100]  Women had more freedoms in Egypt than many areas.
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:08.081]  All of that erased.
[01:03:08.081 --> 01:03:15.332]  Our government overthrowing it, putting Morrissey in, and then trying to block a new government coming in that stopped that.
[01:03:16.738 --> 01:03:31.922]  And the Jihadists, once they got control of the government, were blowing up police stations, bombing ships, attacking the Navy, attacking the Marines, crucifying Christians in the government palace upside down.
[01:03:31.922 --> 01:03:40.785]  And then they raided their houses and the Egyptian government came out and said, Obama is running the Muslim Brotherhood, we have all the documents, we can't believe it, why did you do this?
[01:03:40.785 --> 01:03:45.166]  And then suddenly, you never hear about Egypt in the news anymore and now Egypt is allied with Russia.
[01:03:47.503 --> 01:03:48.784]  Been allied with the U.S.
[01:03:48.784 --> 01:03:53.889]  for 45 years plus.
[01:03:53.889 --> 01:03:59.093]  Now has brought in the Russian Navy and Russian weapons to protect them.
[01:03:59.093 --> 01:04:12.325]  And you see the Egyptians on their TV channels translated into English, and it's their generals, it's their leadership, very smart, educated, people that want to be free and want to have science and want to be prosperous.
[01:04:12.325 --> 01:04:13.486]  An ancient civilization
[01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:16.771]  6,000 plus years old.
[01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:21.613]  And it's their top generals and leaders on TV going, why do you fund the jihadis to kill us?
[01:04:21.613 --> 01:04:22.914]  Why do you want to overthrow?
[01:04:22.914 --> 01:04:28.457]  We want election governments, but you can't blow up 500 churches in one month.
[01:04:28.457 --> 01:04:30.918]  They blew up thousands.
[01:04:30.918 --> 01:04:33.439]  That's who runs our country.
[01:04:33.439 --> 01:04:37.281]  And they got all the documents out of, what we told you before was even in the news.
[01:04:37.281 --> 01:04:39.823]  From Dr. Corsi, he had the documents, other documents.
[01:04:39.823 --> 01:04:44.165]  Obama and his cousins and others running things out of Kenya, just south of Egypt.
[01:04:45.367 --> 01:04:57.394]  Up the Nile, trying to overthrow Egypt, and put foaming at the mouth, head chopper lunatics on, who just run around in diapers all day, beating their wives up, doing no work.
[01:04:59.386 --> 01:05:12.778]  The left-leaning women from the popular daytime TV show The View are finally starting to admit that they agree with Donald Trump on his foreign policy and views on ISIS.
[01:05:12.778 --> 01:05:14.959]  I thought Donald Trump sounded really reasonable today.
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:16.100]  What?
[01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:17.441]  Why do you say that?
[01:05:17.441 --> 01:05:18.361]  Isn't that crazy?
[01:05:18.361 --> 01:05:20.863]  Because we need to be forceful.
[01:05:20.863 --> 01:05:24.224]  We can't have these muted responses to terror.
[01:05:24.224 --> 01:05:26.285]  And let me also say this about Donald Trump.
[01:05:26.285 --> 01:05:28.727]  You know, we trash him often here.
[01:05:28.727 --> 01:05:32.288]  Bottom line is, in January, and you've been saying that, Raven.
[01:05:32.288 --> 01:05:32.969]  I've been saying that.
[01:05:32.969 --> 01:05:36.751]  In January of this year, he said Brussels was a hellhole.
[01:05:36.751 --> 01:05:39.812]  He said there is something going on, Maria, and it is not good.
[01:05:39.812 --> 01:05:41.033]  Talking about Belgium.
[01:05:41.033 --> 01:05:41.573]  He was right.
[01:05:41.573 --> 01:05:42.914]  So he's right on a couple of things.
[01:05:42.914 --> 01:05:45.475]  So his foreign policy isn't so outrageous.
[01:05:45.555 --> 01:05:48.177]  So is Donald Trump really the voice of reason?
[01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:50.699]  And which candidate makes you feel safer?
[01:05:50.699 --> 01:05:53.282]  Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?
[01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:57.805]  Let us know what you think in the comment section right now at InfoWars.com
[01:05:59.318 --> 01:06:02.641]  Cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.

[01:06:58.855 --> 01:07:04.757]  In the first decade of my battle against the globalist, I gained close to 100 pounds.
[01:07:04.757 --> 01:07:12.199]  Now in the last four years, with help from the products at Infowarslife.com, I have lost 80 plus pounds of that weight.
[01:07:12.199 --> 01:07:17.020]  And as many viewers have noted, the weight loss has accelerated in the last year.
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:20.961]  The big turning point was when I did my first liver cleanse.
[01:07:20.961 --> 01:07:24.942]  My friends, I have gotten a lot of dramatic results with the incredible products at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:25.162 --> 01:07:32.248]  But the most dramatic hands down, and the reviewers agree with me, is the Ultimate Cleanse Pack and the results you will see.
[01:07:32.248 --> 01:07:40.835]  We're giving you 20% off the Ultimate Cleanse Pack with Liver Shield, Oxy Powder, and Deep Cleanse all combined with a huge 20% discount at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:41.115 --> 01:07:50.065]  A lot of my family and a lot of the office are now doing the cleanse with me, and so I'm challenging you, the fellow InfoWarriors, to take action with me and do the cleanse as well.
[01:07:50.065 --> 01:07:56.071]  Just go to InfoWarriorsLife.com for yourself, go to the liver cleanse, deep cleanse page, and see the facts.
[01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:57.453]  It is game changing.
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:17.526]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:24.194]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.194 --> 01:08:31.822]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to play the clip from The View, where they come out and say, Donald Trump really is making sense.
[01:08:31.822 --> 01:08:33.264]  And these are the liberal women on the show.
[01:08:34.434 --> 01:08:39.640]  We've got the leader of one of the major parties in Belgium saying Donald Trump's absolutely right.
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.041]  We're going to face more terror attacks.
[01:08:41.041 --> 01:08:41.842]  That was two weeks ago.
[01:08:41.842 --> 01:08:43.344]  We just played that clip earlier.
[01:08:43.344 --> 01:08:44.105]  I'm going to play it again.
[01:08:44.105 --> 01:08:45.706]  It's so important.
[01:08:45.706 --> 01:08:55.738]  And then we have this clip that is a Michael Dellaforte who went as a Westerner, joined ISIS to create a caliphate.
[01:08:56.897 --> 01:08:59.478]  And was inside of it until he figured out that it was a cult.
[01:08:59.478 --> 01:09:04.580]  Boy, that's like going to a Klan rally and sitting around and figuring out you're with a bunch of white supremacists.
[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:10.823]  I mean, how hard is it to figure out these people are whacked out of their brains?
[01:09:10.823 --> 01:09:12.464]  Yeah, and he's still supporting it, I guess.
[01:09:12.464 --> 01:09:17.926]  Well, then how is he walking around on TV?
[01:09:17.926 --> 01:09:19.407]  It's just crazy.
[01:09:19.407 --> 01:09:21.108]  And then I've got all these other clips I mentioned.
[01:09:22.329 --> 01:09:32.374]  Where the police went to the talent agency head's house because he put out a tweet that in the park he talked to women wearing these beekeeper suits, the hoods.
[01:09:32.374 --> 01:09:41.478]  Talent agency boss who confronted a Muslim woman in London, just asked her to explain Brussels, she of course wouldn't disavow it, that's the whole point, was arrested for inciting racial hatred.
[01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:46.634]  It's racial, it's religious.
[01:09:46.634 --> 01:09:51.981]  I can't go to Saudi Arabia and preach the Bible, they'll kill me on the second offense, put me in jail for ten years on the first!
[01:09:53.186 --> 01:09:56.329]  And then this guy, I'm the immigrant bleeping your daughter.
[01:09:56.329 --> 01:10:09.001]  This is who the state appointed over the state funded board to represent Swedish culture in his tweet said I'm the immigrant effing your daughter while you're trying to sleep ignoring hormones calling me daddy.
[01:10:09.001 --> 01:10:11.664]  Now folks, we're a radio show slash TV show.
[01:10:11.664 --> 01:10:12.685]  I've been on the air 21 years.
[01:10:12.685 --> 01:10:15.368]  Everybody knows I have a very clean mouth, okay?
[01:10:16.513 --> 01:10:20.415]  But I have to get like this because this is who governments are putting in charge.
[01:10:20.415 --> 01:10:21.476]  This is what they're saying.
[01:10:21.476 --> 01:10:22.656]  This is what they're pushing.
[01:10:22.656 --> 01:10:24.597]  This is what they're doing.
[01:10:24.597 --> 01:10:30.400]  I have to talk about five-year-olds being taught how to perform oral sex because that's what they teach in schools.
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:38.364]  I have to talk about five-year-olds being confused about their gender with a third bathroom put in because that's what they're doing.
[01:10:38.364 --> 01:10:44.727]  It is just a full-out, insane, devilish assault.
[01:10:44.727 --> 01:10:45.288]  And it's crazy.
[01:10:46.559 --> 01:10:50.242]  No borders activist welcomes Brussels attack as a good thing.
[01:10:50.242 --> 01:10:56.207]  This is the left celebrating radical Islam, which is becoming dominant Islam.
[01:10:56.207 --> 01:10:59.409]  Leftists urge migrants to exploit chaos caused by bombings.
[01:10:59.409 --> 01:11:03.572]  The bridges are being overflowed, the trains, the ships, the tunnel.
[01:11:03.572 --> 01:11:06.695]  It was in the news last week the British police arrested five people last year.
[01:11:06.695 --> 01:11:08.156]  Thousands run through a day.
[01:11:08.156 --> 01:11:10.098]  Europe is wide open.
[01:11:10.098 --> 01:11:13.020]  They announced in major French news last month that, quote,
[01:11:14.062 --> 01:11:28.412]  Quote, the French highway system is collapsing and in a state of anarchy with over a half million migrants, invaders that haven't found a place yet of the other two million that have come into France last three years.
[01:11:28.412 --> 01:11:32.915]  It's five million total in Europe, Germany and France, the lion's share because it is total bedlam.
[01:11:32.915 --> 01:11:33.495]  Go to YouTube.
[01:11:33.495 --> 01:11:43.682]  There are thousands of videos in France of just cars and families being drug out and people breaking into trucks and grabbing them out, beating them and aid workers trying to give them food, beating them.
[01:11:44.122 --> 01:11:51.179]  Steve, I mean, just every day, BBC being attacked in Sweden at a train station, broad daylight, and they're so entitled.
[01:11:51.179 --> 01:11:51.880]  I was in London.
[01:11:53.370 --> 01:12:01.116]  The last time I was videotaping, just to get some scene cutaways, and Muslims across the street ran over screaming at me that I was filming them.
[01:12:01.116 --> 01:12:03.097]  And of course, I was American.
[01:12:03.097 --> 01:12:05.039]  I said, you know, basically, get out of my face.
[01:12:05.039 --> 01:12:05.679]  You want to bow up?
[01:12:05.679 --> 01:12:06.420]  Let's go.
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:08.822]  I wasn't looking for trouble, but I got a free speech.
[01:12:08.822 --> 01:12:10.163]  Then they turned around and ran off.
[01:12:10.163 --> 01:12:11.384]  They were used to Brits.
[01:12:11.384 --> 01:12:12.144]  I'm not trying to be mean.
[01:12:12.144 --> 01:12:13.265]  Brits didn't used to be like this.
[01:12:13.265 --> 01:12:17.829]  They'd literally get on the ground in a fetal position and begin urinating all over themselves.
[01:12:17.829 --> 01:12:19.110]  That'll be the new national flag.
[01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:20.551]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:12:20.551 --> 01:12:22.692]  That same thing happened to me when I was about to interview a former
[01:12:23.527 --> 01:12:24.387]  We're good to go.
[01:12:39.437 --> 01:12:47.565]  I'm out there waiting to have my camera and these people come up and get in my face, his wife's got a hood on, he's blah blah blah, he speaks some English, I go, I'm making a film, a guy's coming.
[01:12:47.565 --> 01:12:52.590]  He yells at me again, I said, listen, go call the police if you want, free speech, I'm working here.
[01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:57.955]  So what I'm saying is the attitude is over the top, arrogant and aggressive.
[01:12:57.955 --> 01:13:03.620]  And I am not going to be a slave here, ladies and gentlemen, I am not putting up with it.
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:04.001]  It's like
[01:13:06.572 --> 01:13:15.854]  National Review last week had an article going, it's white people and also Rust Belt people, poor people that don't like NAFTA and GATT and their jobs being gone that like Trump.
[01:13:15.854 --> 01:13:17.695]  You deserve it.
[01:13:17.695 --> 01:13:19.075]  You deserve it.
[01:13:19.075 --> 01:13:25.397]  And it was like this, I don't like seeing any group put down and told they deserve something, they're a bunch of scum just for who they are.
[01:13:25.397 --> 01:13:26.457]  But David Knight made the point.
[01:13:27.665 --> 01:13:30.107]  I'm not going to sit at the back of the bus because I'm white.
[01:13:30.107 --> 01:13:41.935]  They have taken everything that Martin Luther King talked about that was so true and inverted it now, and it is a crazy free-for-all where every weirdo leftist group, you know, some 10-year-old quote
[01:13:43.004 --> 01:13:48.949]  Transsexual gets to go in the room with your daughters and take showers with them at gym because they think they're a girl.
[01:13:48.949 --> 01:13:50.771]  It's all about them dominating us.
[01:13:50.771 --> 01:13:53.193]  I'm going to Pastor Manning for the balance of the hour.
[01:13:53.193 --> 01:13:56.916]  Start taking your calls at about 40 after, but I am wound up.
[01:13:56.916 --> 01:13:58.858]  I'm going to play this one clip we didn't get to last hour.
[01:14:00.031 --> 01:14:11.115]  This is this person that fought reportedly with ISIS, Michael Dellaforte, and talks about his dream to live under an Islamic caliphate would become a reality in Europe.
[01:14:11.115 --> 01:14:13.115]  And now he, I guess, he still supports it.
[01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:15.736]  And is, I guess, allowed to go around and do this.
[01:14:15.736 --> 01:14:17.197]  Let's go ahead and play it.
[01:14:17.197 --> 01:14:22.858]  How many people do you know from your group of friends who've left for Syria, who want to join ISIS?
[01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:23.259]  60.
[01:14:23.259 --> 01:14:23.379]  60?
[01:14:23.379 --> 01:14:24.519]  Yeah.
[01:14:24.519 --> 01:14:25.519]  What happened to those 60 people?
[01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:29.597]  Went to paradise?
[01:14:29.597 --> 01:14:32.098]  Went to paradise, huh?
[01:14:32.098 --> 01:14:32.538]  Look at that guy.
[01:14:32.538 --> 01:14:34.299]  I think he's so tough and scary.
[01:14:34.299 --> 01:14:37.000]  Looks like a devil, doesn't he?
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.761]  Like a little devil.
[01:14:40.761 --> 01:14:46.502]  My dream is still to live underneath the Islamic caliphate, underneath the Islamic law.
[01:14:46.502 --> 01:14:47.322]  That's my dream.
[01:14:47.322 --> 01:14:48.063]  And they let him back in.
[01:14:48.063 --> 01:14:50.203]  Do you think that's ever going to happen here?
[01:14:50.203 --> 01:14:50.423]  In Europe?
[01:14:50.423 --> 01:14:50.643]  Yes.
[01:14:50.643 --> 01:14:51.484]  There will be a day.
[01:14:51.484 --> 01:14:54.064]  There will be a day, yes, when it's the Islamic goal.
[01:14:54.064 --> 01:14:56.085]  You think sooner or later they'll make it to Europe?
[01:14:57.472 --> 01:14:59.653]  I think they're already in Europe.
[01:14:59.653 --> 01:15:02.834]  Because ISIS is not a group, it's an ideology.
[01:15:02.834 --> 01:15:08.976]  He thinks he's so tough, like it's so mysterious to be part of such an evil, cowardly group.
[01:15:08.976 --> 01:15:15.639]  And all over Europe, the Swedes, you name it, bring them back in and give them psychological counseling and welfare because they were in ISIS.
[01:15:15.639 --> 01:15:18.580]  And then still let them operate and put them on the news.
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:19.480]  And what do you want of that?
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:23.522]  Trendy, liberal, 18-year-old women text him and want to hang out with him.
[01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:28.932]  Just like they want to get picked up by a pimp and used and have cigarettes put out on their eyeballs.
[01:15:28.932 --> 01:15:30.033]  They love it!
[01:15:30.033 --> 01:15:36.057]  Dr. Manning joins us from atlah.org.
[01:15:36.057 --> 01:15:41.081]  He spearheaded the boycott nationwide to get Al Sharpton kicked off MSNBC.
[01:15:41.081 --> 01:15:43.803]  He is in the face of the dragon.
[01:15:43.803 --> 01:15:44.984]  He's got the eye of the tiger.
[01:15:44.984 --> 01:15:46.085]  He doesn't need to be introduced here.
[01:15:46.085 --> 01:15:52.049]  I appreciate him holding while I was ranting, but I am particularly getting wound up now because this is just crazy.
[01:15:52.729 --> 01:15:58.171]  Atla.org, Pastor Manning, thank you so much for coming on to give us your commentary and your analysis.
[01:15:58.171 --> 01:16:00.812]  You heard me ranting there, but this is real anger.
[01:16:00.812 --> 01:16:08.614]  I mean, this is getting so crazy where they're arresting people that mildly criticize Islam, not just in Europe, but here.
[01:16:08.614 --> 01:16:10.815]  I want to ask you, who is the left?
[01:16:10.815 --> 01:16:21.218]  Who are these people that would take the countries that have given them so much freedom and then try to bring in the most radical forms of Islam that would literally murder them?
[01:16:22.469 --> 01:16:24.050]  Well, you know, Alex, there are a couple of things.
[01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:25.631]  By the way, thank you so very much for having me.
[01:16:25.631 --> 01:16:28.953]  It's always a great honor to share on your broadcast.
[01:16:28.953 --> 01:16:29.774]  A couple of things.
[01:16:29.774 --> 01:16:33.837]  One, to your earlier point regarding the language that you use.
[01:16:33.837 --> 01:16:37.940]  I mean, you've been broadcasting for 21 years, and we know that your language is always upscale.
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:53.205]  But with respect to what's happening now, especially with this transgender sexual ideology that's going on, they are counting on you using wimpy, if you will, politically correct language that they might be able to continue to advance their cause.
[01:16:53.205 --> 01:17:01.148]  So your language, if you don't get salty, you're going to get slaughtered by the politically correct crowd.
[01:17:01.148 --> 01:17:04.489]  The other thing is that you made mention of in your rant,
[01:17:05.690 --> 01:17:13.015]  First of all, Islam is the biggest con game in terms of getting people to go out to fight that I've ever heard of.
[01:17:13.015 --> 01:17:17.899]  You get promised 70 virgins in paradise if you get killed.
[01:17:17.899 --> 01:17:24.044]  If there's a con game of con games, that is the most unique of all con games.
[01:17:24.044 --> 01:17:29.548]  And yet it is pervasive among a billion people who believe that con game.
[01:17:29.548 --> 01:17:31.610]  And so they go out and they do all of this fighting.
[01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:33.571]  But I think the other thing, Alex,
[01:17:34.434 --> 01:17:35.255]  We're good to go.
[01:17:44.082 --> 01:17:57.648]  I have this desire to look further and deeper into why is it that a city like Brussels or Paris, if you're looking at the recent... Yes, why are they hitting the places that literally roll out a red carpet to them?
[01:17:57.648 --> 01:17:58.168]  Yeah!
[01:17:58.168 --> 01:18:02.570]  I mean, there has to be another answer other than what we're getting from the dung-head media addicts.
[01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:04.111]  I mean, I don't believe them.
[01:18:04.111 --> 01:18:09.273]  And we're going to have to look deeper, and perhaps you will have a, you know, just looking closer, this would have a better answer.
[01:18:09.273 --> 01:18:10.934]  Because it doesn't make sense.
[01:18:11.334 --> 01:18:16.598]  They're not hitting an organization or states or nations that are hostile to them in many ways.
[01:18:16.598 --> 01:18:24.903]  I mean, you go to Paris or France or Belgium as a Muslim and you get treated, I mean, royally.
[01:18:24.903 --> 01:18:26.444]  They roll out the red carpet at you.
[01:18:26.444 --> 01:18:36.911]  So why is this happening here rather than some other nation perhaps where we might be a little bit more adverse to Islamic thought or ISIS in general?
[01:18:36.911 --> 01:18:38.312]  I don't understand that.
[01:18:38.312 --> 01:18:40.413]  But I don't believe what I'm seeing on the dunghead media.
[01:18:40.413 --> 01:18:40.934]  I just don't.
[01:18:41.595 --> 01:18:42.857]  So there's something else behind this.
[01:18:42.857 --> 01:18:55.738]  Well clearly, I've talked to a lot of insiders and others and they say they're bringing them into attack, then they're going to make Christians and others control our speech as to not upset the Muslims, and they're also going to use it to roll out a police state against everybody.
[01:18:56.775 --> 01:18:57.175]  I don't know.
[01:18:57.175 --> 01:18:59.197]  I mean, that's a possibility.
[01:18:59.197 --> 01:19:01.759]  I'm not sure that that is the ultimate.
[01:19:01.759 --> 01:19:07.823]  But there's something going on with the powers that be, the world order that wants to control everything.
[01:19:07.823 --> 01:19:18.891]  And I think they see ISIS, Islam rather, as a vehicle through which they could either use them as a stepping stone to do more world control.
[01:19:18.891 --> 01:19:20.132]  I'm not sure.
[01:19:21.132 --> 01:19:28.877]  There could be some adverse thoughts to the non-productive state of a state like Brussels or Belgium, for instance.
[01:19:28.877 --> 01:19:31.739]  Or in Paris, there's no love of Jesus.
[01:19:31.739 --> 01:19:34.881]  The Parisians are without God.
[01:19:34.881 --> 01:19:41.246]  They're pretty much a godless people with a liberal mindset that's far worse than anything that we can experience here.
[01:19:42.065 --> 01:19:47.248]  I mean, you know, 9-11 appointed everybody to hate Muslims.
[01:19:47.248 --> 01:19:48.830]  It changed the entire world order.
[01:20:12.145 --> 01:20:14.048]  Billion make a zillion dollars.
[01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:21.589]  Right!
[01:20:21.589 --> 01:20:27.371]  So, I mean, what's behind what's happening in Belgium and in France?
[01:20:27.371 --> 01:20:32.553]  I don't believe it's just Muslims who want to force the Quran and get people to say Allah Akbar.
[01:20:32.553 --> 01:20:33.453]  Oh, I agree with you.
[01:20:33.453 --> 01:20:35.374]  I was against the earlier wars.
[01:20:35.374 --> 01:20:37.334]  I would be against, quote, Islamophobia.
[01:20:37.334 --> 01:20:38.474]  Just hate Muslims.
[01:20:38.474 --> 01:20:41.435]  But clearly, they're putting the most radical in charge.
[01:20:41.435 --> 01:20:43.656]  Saudi Arabia is allowing them to bring them in.
[01:20:43.656 --> 01:20:44.916]  They're killing people.
[01:20:44.916 --> 01:20:46.397]  And the left is defending it.
[01:20:46.937 --> 01:20:49.878]  And acting like Donald Trump is to blame, that's where I get so angry.
[01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:54.120]  So I agree, it's a lot bigger than just getting upset with the radical Islamist.
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:21:08.227]  But I think at the end of the day, the globalists admit they want to clash the civilizations in their own PNAC documents, and out of the clash between the dying decadent West and radical Islam, a world government will come in to basically referee and arbitrate.
[01:21:09.261 --> 01:21:10.921]  Well, you know, let me be clear.
[01:21:10.921 --> 01:21:14.482]  I'm not here in support of Islam in any way, shape, form, or fashion.
[01:21:14.482 --> 01:21:16.003]  I think they're a barbaric group.
[01:21:16.003 --> 01:21:22.024]  They were prophesied to be so with Hagar's birth of Ishmael way back there during the days of Abraham.
[01:21:22.024 --> 01:21:23.445]  I want to be clear about that.
[01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:28.206]  But I think your phrase just a few moments ago of a dying, decadent West
[01:21:29.286 --> 01:21:33.767]  Perhaps there is some sort of a new regeneration that they're trying to put forward.
[01:21:33.767 --> 01:21:34.387]  I'm not sure.
[01:21:34.387 --> 01:21:36.648]  I just don't believe the rhetoric, Alex.
[01:21:36.648 --> 01:21:37.348]  Well, I agree.
[01:21:37.348 --> 01:21:38.128]  I've looked at that.
[01:21:38.128 --> 01:21:46.010]  Allowing these outrages by radical Islam could spark a rebirth of Western values and appreciation of liberty and freedom.
[01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:49.210]  But then I look at what the politically correct people are doing.
[01:21:49.210 --> 01:21:51.151]  They really want to get rid of free speech.
[01:21:51.151 --> 01:21:57.572]  I just think, I think the left has degenerated into pure evil and they're allied with radical Islam because they hate bitter clingers.
[01:21:58.459 --> 01:22:03.161]  Listen, let's look at a group like Black Lives Matter, for instance.
[01:22:03.161 --> 01:22:24.631]  I mean, you would think after the alleged black president, who really isn't black, but okay, everybody said so, and Barack Hussein Obama, that the political movement, especially among black people under what had been taught by Dr. King, would advance into a different approach to dealing with social or political ideas or elections.
[01:22:24.631 --> 01:22:26.432]  Here we got a radical group
[01:22:27.392 --> 01:22:36.817]  Just a grade below ISIS or Islam, storming campaigns, going in and creating all kinds of havoc.
[01:22:36.817 --> 01:22:52.704]  But the other thing, then giving to black people in general, Alex, a blanket, if you will, view that all black people are radical, just one step short of being Black Panthers, Black Lives Matter, which was absolutely unnecessary.
[01:22:53.464 --> 01:22:54.305]  Absolutely!
[01:22:54.305 --> 01:22:57.027]  So, I mean, I see the ISIS thing and the Black Lives Matter sort of, kind of...
[01:23:10.458 --> 01:23:12.340]  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:17.445]  So, you know, what is really going on behind this?
[01:23:17.445 --> 01:23:22.911]  It isn't just the fact that ISIS or Muslims want to take charge of territory.
[01:23:22.911 --> 01:23:26.335]  Listen, Saudi Arabia's got tons and tons and tons of money.
[01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:30.639]  George Bush was in the pocket of King Abdullah, and so is Obama.
[01:23:30.639 --> 01:23:32.201]  So, I mean, they don't need
[01:23:32.441 --> 01:23:35.723]  To be militant and to kill a whole bunch of people to get their way.
[01:23:35.723 --> 01:23:41.347]  They can buy their way or bribe their way into the lives of politicians and do what they want to do.
[01:23:41.347 --> 01:23:46.450]  I'm just highly suspicious of what's going on and wish I had a better answer for your audience today.
[01:23:46.450 --> 01:23:53.574]  Well, I think you had a better answer because you just laid out, I wasn't even thinking about the Hegelian dialectic and all that, and then there you are laying it out and it's prima facie.
[01:23:53.574 --> 01:23:56.016]  You know, it's true on the surface.
[01:23:56.016 --> 01:24:00.879]  Obama doesn't even lean down when he meets a Christian leader.
[01:24:01.659 --> 01:24:09.296]  But, but, and he shouldn't by the way because he's the head of state, but he does bow down to any Muslim leader he finds or foreign royalty.
[01:24:09.296 --> 01:24:10.398]  That is disgusting.
[01:24:10.398 --> 01:24:11.240]  What do you think that's about?
[01:24:12.545 --> 01:24:16.268]  I think it's about simply what's in his heart.
[01:24:16.268 --> 01:24:19.972]  As a man think of in his heart, so is he.
[01:24:19.972 --> 01:24:34.604]  You have reverence for certain principles, Alex, I've known you over the years, and you can hear the change in your voice when there comes to various patriotic reverences and also the sternness in your voice and the clarity and resolve when you talk about
[01:24:34.884 --> 01:24:35.725]  The globalists!
[01:24:35.725 --> 01:24:45.933]  I mean, your voice changes as an attitude that these people are dangerous, they're diabolical, and don't mistake my voice, or mistake what I'm saying.
[01:24:45.933 --> 01:24:53.700]  So when Obama comes in contact with the Muslims and others, his heart tells him to bow down to this power.
[01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:58.724]  Well he's so sweet to them, and then every Easter he bad-mouths Christians, and said, remember last year?
[01:24:58.724 --> 01:24:59.925]  And says we're mean and hateful.
[01:25:01.069 --> 01:25:07.874]  Well, you know, the funeral of Judge Justice Scalia was not attended by the Mac Daddy Obama.
[01:25:07.874 --> 01:25:09.094]  He didn't go.
[01:25:09.094 --> 01:25:16.339]  And one of my audience participants said the reason why he did not go is because it was in a Catholic church.
[01:25:16.339 --> 01:25:20.302]  You know, the Catholics are heavy on biblical symbolism.
[01:25:20.302 --> 01:25:25.105]  They've got the cross and Jesus all over everywhere in their sanctuaries.
[01:25:25.105 --> 01:25:29.768]  And when Obama, in his first year of office, spoke at Notre Dame and also at
[01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:39.494]  At George Weston University there in Washington D.C., if I'm pronouncing the university correct, he made them cover up the picture of Jesus.
[01:25:39.494 --> 01:25:40.055]  That's right.
[01:25:40.055 --> 01:25:44.877]  And cover up the cross at Notre Dame and also at the university.
[01:25:44.877 --> 01:25:48.480]  But he couldn't get the Catholics to do that at Scalia's funeral, so he didn't go.
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:52.542]  That's his, you're right, he bashes Christians.
[01:25:52.542 --> 01:25:57.405]  That's almost like a vampire, because I forgot he'll never be seen with a cross around him.
[01:26:01.491 --> 01:26:05.414]  He's a vampire.
[01:26:05.414 --> 01:26:06.595]  He's a vampire.
[01:26:06.595 --> 01:26:11.719]  He will not, I mean a cross will actually bring him to his knees.
[01:26:11.719 --> 01:26:13.140]  So he has it covered up.
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:18.985]  I was so put out when Notre Dame did that going back, you remember when that happened going back a year ago?
[01:26:18.985 --> 01:26:21.367]  Not a year ago, but several years ago.
[01:26:21.367 --> 01:26:22.168]  I've forgotten about that.
[01:26:22.828 --> 01:26:37.926]  No, and Dr. Alan Keyes was out there on his knees begging people to wake up to what's going on, that you've got to cover up the cross of Jesus to get this low-life piece of trash called Obama to come and speak at one of the Catholics' most leading and notorious organizations.
[01:26:38.747 --> 01:26:46.855]  That's crazy because when he goes to India or anywhere else, he will stand in front of any other religious symbol but the cross and they do cover it up everywhere.
[01:26:46.855 --> 01:26:47.435]  Wow!
[01:26:47.435 --> 01:26:52.780]  That is such a message that he doesn't want to be seen worldwide with that image associated with him.
[01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:54.001]  That is unbelievable.
[01:26:54.702 --> 01:27:03.127]  What are we going to do about Christians in America that allow that to take place, who feel cowed into allowing him to do that?
[01:27:03.127 --> 01:27:04.027]  Hands are tied.
[01:27:04.027 --> 01:27:06.008]  We're just helpless.
[01:27:06.008 --> 01:27:15.113]  Freedom of speech, freedom of religion means that separation of church and state means that as Christians we shouldn't challenge him.
[01:27:15.113 --> 01:27:17.955]  I was about to say, I've never worn jewelry other than a watch.
[01:27:18.835 --> 01:27:25.833]  But I just feel moved the last year or so to get a small cross and start wearing it around my neck just because the enemy hates it so much.
[01:27:25.833 --> 01:27:27.817]  Why does the enemy hate that symbol so much?
[01:27:28.686 --> 01:27:33.390]  Because it's the most powerful symbol in all of the known universe.
[01:27:33.390 --> 01:27:40.256]  You can go from planet to planet, from star to star, from galaxy to galaxy, and the cross is it, Alex.
[01:27:40.256 --> 01:27:40.756]  It's it.
[01:27:40.756 --> 01:27:41.737]  I got one right here.
[01:27:41.737 --> 01:27:42.358]  Can y'all see it?
[01:27:42.358 --> 01:27:43.358]  Hey, look here.
[01:27:43.358 --> 01:27:44.319]  I got it right here.
[01:27:44.319 --> 01:27:45.941]  I'm wearing a cross right here.
[01:27:45.941 --> 01:27:49.323]  It's on a little chain on my vest, but I'm wearing it.
[01:27:49.323 --> 01:27:50.785]  Alex, go get one.
[01:27:50.785 --> 01:27:51.425]  It's power.
[01:27:53.187 --> 01:27:54.368]  I'd like to see Obama.
[01:27:54.368 --> 01:27:56.409]  First thing I'd do, I'd flash him.
[01:27:56.409 --> 01:27:58.131]  I'd have my jacket closed, you know.
[01:27:58.131 --> 01:28:02.375]  If I came into his presence, I'd have my jacket closed.
[01:28:02.375 --> 01:28:04.617]  Then when I came up to him, I'd flash open my cross.
[01:28:04.617 --> 01:28:07.859]  Well, I've talked to people about how the flies are always landing on him.
[01:28:07.859 --> 01:28:09.140]  People leave it inside the White House.
[01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:14.165]  And I talked to another prominent person, and they said, no, there's something really evil about Obama when you're in his presence.
[01:28:14.165 --> 01:28:15.066]  Have you ever been in his presence?
[01:28:16.030 --> 01:28:17.071]  No, never.
[01:28:17.071 --> 01:28:20.192]  I boycotted him when he came to Harlem.
[01:28:20.192 --> 01:28:25.335]  I was just a door or two away from him across the street when he came to Harlem at the Red Rooster.
[01:28:25.335 --> 01:28:26.316]  I let a boycott.
[01:28:26.316 --> 01:28:31.018]  Our church is out there in mass numbers boycotting him, but that's the closest I've ever been to the creep.
[01:28:32.139 --> 01:28:33.180]  I want to go to break.
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:33.980]  I want to come back.
[01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:37.221]  The toll-free number to join us, because callers always bring up great issues that I wouldn't bring up.
[01:28:37.221 --> 01:28:37.842]  800-259-9231.
[01:28:37.842 --> 01:28:38.662]  800-259-9231.
[01:28:38.662 --> 01:28:44.465]  Pastor Manning is a great guy.
[01:28:44.465 --> 01:28:49.948]  He doesn't ask me to do this, but people like him that come on, I ask the listeners to check out his ministry.
[01:28:49.948 --> 01:28:55.890]  That'd be a great place, in my view, to tithe and support people if you only have globalist churches in your area.
[01:28:55.890 --> 01:28:59.572]  He feeds the local folks, teaches them about what's happening with the New World Order.
[01:28:59.572 --> 01:29:01.193]  He really is the type of church I would attend.
[01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:03.214]  If I live near to him.
[01:29:03.214 --> 01:29:04.494]  Otla.org.
[01:29:04.494 --> 01:29:10.517]  Great videos, great reports, great TV show, radio show, great materials for everybody free there on the site.
[01:29:10.517 --> 01:29:12.138]  But Otla.org.
[01:29:12.138 --> 01:29:20.442]  He's been through a lot in Harlem over 30 years fighting and has now become a major leader in the area by being willing to go up against gangsters like Al Sharpton.
[01:29:20.442 --> 01:29:22.803]  So he's a good friend and a great patriot.
[01:29:22.803 --> 01:29:24.444]  Pastor James David Manning.
[01:29:24.444 --> 01:29:25.824]  Otla.org.
[01:29:25.824 --> 01:29:26.765]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:29:26.765 --> 01:29:29.426]  I want to get into the Trump phenomenon, the economy,
[01:29:30.206 --> 01:29:33.830]  Uh, geopolitics and a lot more, and the real meaning of Easter.
[01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:36.192]  Because I started just thinking about Obama just now.
[01:29:36.192 --> 01:29:37.713]  He'll never be seen with a cross.
[01:29:37.713 --> 01:29:39.455]  He badmouths Christianity on Easter.
[01:29:39.455 --> 01:29:42.358]  I mean, why does he hate it so much?
[01:29:42.358 --> 01:29:44.440]  Why not act like he just likes it?
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:45.861]  What is the problem there?
[01:29:45.861 --> 01:29:48.303]  That tells you everything, doesn't it?
[01:29:48.303 --> 01:29:49.685]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.685 --> 01:29:52.227]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.227 --> 01:29:54.910]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:12.812]  The left-leaning women from the popular daytime TV show The View are finally starting to admit that they agree with Donald Trump on his foreign policy and views on ISIS.
[01:30:12.812 --> 01:30:15.054]  I thought Donald Trump sounded really reasonable today.
[01:30:15.054 --> 01:30:16.015]  My law enforcement
[01:30:16.155 --> 01:30:20.918]  Because we need to be forceful.
[01:30:20.918 --> 01:30:24.260]  We can't have these muted responses to terror.
[01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:26.301]  And let me also say this about Donald Trump.
[01:30:26.301 --> 01:30:28.782]  You know, we trash him often here.
[01:30:28.782 --> 01:30:32.224]  Bottom line is, in January, and you've been saying that.
[01:30:32.224 --> 01:30:33.025]  I've been saying that.
[01:30:33.025 --> 01:30:36.927]  In January of this year, he said Brussels was a hellhole.
[01:30:36.927 --> 01:30:39.869]  He said there is something going on, Maria, and it is not good.
[01:30:39.869 --> 01:30:41.069]  Talking about Belgium.
[01:30:41.069 --> 01:30:41.610]  He was right.
[01:30:41.610 --> 01:30:42.950]  So he's right on a couple of things.
[01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:45.512]  So his foreign policy isn't so outrageous.
[01:30:45.572 --> 01:30:48.213]  So is Donald Trump really the voice of reason?
[01:30:48.213 --> 01:30:50.734]  And which candidate makes you feel safer?
[01:30:50.734 --> 01:30:53.316]  Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?
[01:30:53.316 --> 01:30:59.278]  Let us know what you think in the comment section right now at InfoWars.com.

[01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.930]  Uh, yeah.
[01:31:59.930 --> 01:32:02.211]  First of all, I want to say, take the 12.
[01:32:02.211 --> 01:32:02.771]  That's two.
[01:32:02.771 --> 01:32:05.753]  Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[01:32:05.753 --> 01:32:06.713]  I use them all.
[01:32:06.713 --> 01:32:07.693]  They're phenomenal.
[01:32:07.693 --> 01:32:08.434]  They work.
[01:32:08.434 --> 01:32:09.274]  Buy them, folks.
[01:32:09.274 --> 01:32:09.754]  Thank you, brother.
[01:32:09.754 --> 01:32:11.675]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:32:11.675 --> 01:32:17.897]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[01:32:17.897 --> 01:32:19.878]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[01:32:19.878 --> 01:32:25.300]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:26.461]  I'm a nine-year listener.

[01:32:30.263 --> 01:32:31.144]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:32:31.144 --> 01:32:32.184]  Have they worked for you?
[01:32:32.184 --> 01:32:35.046]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:32:35.046 --> 01:32:36.407]  What products are you taking?
[01:32:36.407 --> 01:32:44.413]  Everything from Supermail to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA Force.
[01:32:44.413 --> 01:32:47.895]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[01:32:48.035 --> 01:32:53.079]  Visit Infowarslives.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[01:32:53.079 --> 01:32:55.240]  That's Infowarslives.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.322]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:49.341]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:49.341 --> 01:33:51.142]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:33:51.142 --> 01:33:55.244]  Pastor David J. Manning is our guest, or James David Manning is our guest.
[01:33:55.244 --> 01:33:57.085]  My dad's name is David.
[01:33:57.085 --> 01:34:02.027]  I tell you, my head is spinning right now because I know I start hyperventilating.
[01:34:02.027 --> 01:34:11.831]  It's just when you study the news all day, and you look at what these people are doing, and you start making the connections, I'd forgotten that just last month you wouldn't be seen.
[01:34:12.904 --> 01:34:18.485]  With the crosses, and with images of Christ, and other Christian iconography.
[01:34:18.485 --> 01:34:24.206]  I forgot that they've actually made them, when he gives speeches at churches, cover it up.
[01:34:24.206 --> 01:34:30.707]  And I forgot that the Methodist Church has always been, quote, liberal, but like abolitionist liberal, in a good way.
[01:34:30.707 --> 01:34:39.529]  And I've got family that's, some family that's Baptist, others that are Methodist, and they can't even go to their Methodist churches anymore, including the biggest one here in town, because let me tell you,
[01:34:40.632 --> 01:34:45.734]  They get up there and they're talking about all over the country taking crosses out.
[01:34:45.734 --> 01:34:49.195]  Germany's doing it too, saying it's hurtful to those that aren't Christian.
[01:34:49.195 --> 01:34:51.716]  Well, then you're not a church anymore!
[01:34:51.716 --> 01:34:54.777]  So, that's what this move is about.
[01:34:54.777 --> 01:34:58.198]  Everybody else's symbols can be there, but Christians.
[01:34:58.198 --> 01:34:59.598]  This is so discriminatory.
[01:34:59.598 --> 01:35:01.259]  We're gonna go back to Pastor Manning.
[01:35:01.259 --> 01:35:05.520]  In a moment, we got David and Doug and Mike and Robert and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:07.601]  Remember to join us on this live Thursday edition.
[01:35:09.028 --> 01:35:10.568]  is 800-259-9231.
[01:35:10.568 --> 01:35:17.630]  But as they attempt to intimidate free speech, it's time to take action.
[01:35:17.630 --> 01:35:25.352]  Lord Monckton said he didn't used to wear a big cross until they started trying to restrict him and said don't wear them in England.
[01:35:25.352 --> 01:35:27.533]  And the UK, on the news, they said they're hurtful.
[01:35:27.533 --> 01:35:29.894]  He wears a giant one now.
[01:35:29.894 --> 01:35:30.934]  And you know what, I just thought of it.
[01:35:30.934 --> 01:35:38.036]  I'm gonna put out a t-shirt that's basically Crusader style, with a big shield and a big cross,
[01:35:39.497 --> 01:35:43.360]  It was something like defending free speech since 13-something.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:50.945]  Because it was Islam that invaded Europe dozens of times, killed millions, till the Crusades responded to push it out.
[01:35:50.945 --> 01:36:02.133]  And I was taught in school and college that the West was bad in the Crusades, even though the very textbook admitted that Islam started expanding before Mohammed even died.
[01:36:02.133 --> 01:36:05.436]  It had taken over thousands of miles.
[01:36:05.436 --> 01:36:07.257]  So, I mean, I'm just, it's crazy.
[01:36:08.789 --> 01:36:12.613]  It's crazy to sit there and blame.
[01:36:16.806 --> 01:36:19.688]  Groups that didn't do anything for things that happened in history.
[01:36:19.688 --> 01:36:21.268]  It just shows the attack on reality.
[01:36:21.268 --> 01:36:25.371]  It's like blaming Donald Trump for saying, we're not vetting any of the people coming in from the Middle East.
[01:36:25.371 --> 01:36:27.312]  We'll block them all until we vet them.
[01:36:27.312 --> 01:36:30.133]  Before that, he's like, well, we got to bring the Christians in, they're being killed.
[01:36:30.133 --> 01:36:31.934]  No, sir, they're not letting the Christians come out.
[01:36:31.934 --> 01:36:35.156]  For every couple hundred Muslims, they'll let one Christian in.
[01:36:35.156 --> 01:36:36.357]  That's in the news.
[01:36:36.357 --> 01:36:40.719]  They won't let Shiites in because they're not allied with Obama.
[01:36:40.719 --> 01:36:41.019]  It's crazy.
[01:36:41.019 --> 01:36:44.301]  We're going back to our guest, back to the news, and then your phone calls, but briefly,
[01:36:45.632 --> 01:36:47.253]  It's important to exercise the First Amendment.
[01:36:47.253 --> 01:36:57.719]  We sold out, of course, the limited edition Hillary for President t-shirt, but now we have a new limited edition, it looks like a campaign shirt, Hillary for President 2016 and beyond.
[01:36:57.719 --> 01:37:00.080]  She's tried to call up the different major
[01:37:02.256 --> 01:37:09.242]  Comedy groups and others and comedy clubs have said you can't criticize me or I'll have your license revoked.
[01:37:09.242 --> 01:37:11.604]  We have to exercise the First Amendment or lose it.
[01:37:11.604 --> 01:37:14.827]  A little bit of money we make when we sell each t-shirt is vital to run this operation.
[01:37:14.827 --> 01:37:17.689]  It's like Trump funding his campaign with ball caps and t-shirts.
[01:37:17.689 --> 01:37:19.711]  It takes a lot of them to fund the operation.
[01:37:19.711 --> 01:37:24.495]  And so InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com to find the nutraceuticals.
[01:37:24.495 --> 01:37:26.957]  We have 10% off the Deep Cleanze.

[01:37:54.261 --> 01:37:55.923]  The detox is amazing.

[01:37:56.644 --> 01:37:58.325]  Get it with the liver cleanse.
[01:37:58.325 --> 01:38:01.128]  You can also just put it in water by itself and not do the intense cleanse.
[01:38:01.128 --> 01:38:02.510]  That's what a lot of folks do.
[01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:03.831]  And it works synergistically together.
[01:38:03.831 --> 01:38:05.653]  15% off when you get the two together.
[01:38:05.653 --> 01:38:06.774]  Or get it with Oxy Powder.
[01:38:06.774 --> 01:38:07.695]  All three together.

[01:38:12.014 --> 01:38:13.056]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:38:13.056 --> 01:38:14.017]  Thank you all for your prayers.
[01:38:14.017 --> 01:38:15.699]  Thank you all for spreading the word because
[01:38:27.358 --> 01:38:30.119]  I know I'm hard to put up with sometimes, but people know my heart's in the right place.
[01:38:30.119 --> 01:38:34.860]  And, you know, when I have these guests up, Pastor Manning's never asked me to plug his website or plug his ministry.
[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:44.823]  I just know from local news and following him for a decade, the type of good work he does, when I say, please support him if you can, or you find it in your heart, or support us, we're trying to support you.
[01:38:44.823 --> 01:38:46.603]  I'm not complaining if you don't support us.
[01:38:46.603 --> 01:38:48.744]  I know how poor people are under this depression.
[01:38:48.744 --> 01:38:55.846]  They want to make us poor in their own documents with Cloward and Piven and others, so that the West is so broken, we're busy just trying to get food every day.
[01:38:56.786 --> 01:38:58.967]  They want to make us poor as a tool of control.
[01:38:58.967 --> 01:39:04.948]  That's why the globalists want to bankrupt us with socialism and communism, because they can't compete with free market.
[01:39:04.948 --> 01:39:05.789]  And that's just a fact.
[01:39:05.789 --> 01:39:09.690]  But our kids are so dumbed down, many of them, they don't know that at these colleges.
[01:39:09.690 --> 01:39:15.291]  Because the big robber barons like Bill Gates don't want them to know how successful they could be.
[01:39:15.291 --> 01:39:17.472]  The globalists are in competition with competition.
[01:39:17.472 --> 01:39:20.513]  As John D. Rockefeller said, competition is a sin.
[01:39:20.513 --> 01:39:21.313]  Look it up for yourself.
[01:39:22.861 --> 01:39:36.208]  So whether it's spreading the word about the broadcast, supporting our local affiliates, supporting their local sponsors, becoming a sponsor locally, praying for us, sending out the video links, the story links, whatever the case is, it's all having a giant effect and God bless you.
[01:39:36.208 --> 01:39:39.670]  But our audience is metrically more than doubling every year.
[01:39:39.670 --> 01:39:44.212]  Until about five years ago, as audience went up, money went up.
[01:39:44.212 --> 01:39:49.475]  We're in such a recession slash depression that audience doubles, triples, quadruples now in a year.
[01:39:49.475 --> 01:39:50.316]  Money doesn't go up.
[01:39:51.311 --> 01:39:56.136]  So I know for people like Manning, without asking him, I bet it's tough, even though his audiences explode.
[01:39:56.136 --> 01:40:06.546]  Because this country and this world's in trouble, folks, and that's why we're pulling to turn our jobs back on, pulling to turn our factories back on, pulling to not shut down the coal power plants that are totally clean.
[01:40:07.327 --> 01:40:09.167]  And our power prices have doubled.
[01:40:09.167 --> 01:40:12.868]  That's why we're pulling for Trump, because we want to make America free and great again.
[01:40:12.868 --> 01:40:23.951]  So, Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or ATLA, A-T-L-A-H dot O-R-G, to go support Pastor Manning and his important work, or just spread his videos out as well, because this is what it's all about.
[01:40:23.951 --> 01:40:31.653]  I'm not in competition with Pastor Manning, with James David Manning, or WorldNet Daily, or Daily Caller, or Matt Drudge at DrudgeReport.com.
[01:40:32.523 --> 01:40:34.088]  Or anybody else for that matter.
[01:40:34.088 --> 01:40:36.576]  I don't want to be in competition with Glenn Beck.
[01:40:36.576 --> 01:40:38.763]  Who's constantly trying to sabotage us and dirty tricking.
[01:40:39.992 --> 01:40:46.056]  I want more of us out there to fight together to restore the Republic and restore religious freedom in the First Amendment.
[01:40:46.056 --> 01:40:50.380]  Now, I got him on, so I might as well go to him, but I'm just really upset today, as people can tell.
[01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:52.341]  Pastor Manning, I want to go to calls in about six, seven minutes.
[01:40:52.341 --> 01:41:04.049]  I want to play some clips as well, but perhaps you can... I know you have your own show coming up, but perhaps you can stay a little bit, maybe five minutes, into the next hour so we can finish up with more of the callers that are here holding.
[01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:09.398]  I just feel such an earnestness and it seems like the enemy is moving on all fronts.
[01:41:09.398 --> 01:41:14.246]  Is the enemy moving on all fronts because they're in trouble or because they're emboldened?
[01:41:14.246 --> 01:41:16.650]  And what do you think about Trump, other big issues?
[01:41:16.650 --> 01:41:17.952]  What's front and center for you right now?
[01:41:19.992 --> 01:41:22.254]  I'll get to Trump in just a moment, but let me say this.
[01:41:22.254 --> 01:41:34.002]  We are, I'm getting ready to have a staff meeting with our programming department and our ministry that we broadcast to prepare ourselves for the collapse of the dunghead media.
[01:41:34.002 --> 01:41:36.144]  One of the things that, and to speak about Trump,
[01:41:36.684 --> 01:41:48.326]  One of the things that Trump has been able to do profoundly is to demonstrate at all media that they are phonies, they're liars, they're inconsistent, they're not for the American people, they're bought and paid for.
[01:41:48.326 --> 01:41:53.267]  It doesn't matter whether it's Fox or whether it's MSNBC, he doesn't make a distinction.
[01:41:53.267 --> 01:41:58.588]  They're all in it, if you will, in a way that doesn't benefit the American people.
[01:41:58.588 --> 01:41:59.869]  Trump has made that clear.
[01:41:59.869 --> 01:42:05.710]  What I want to say about the Manning Report and things we do here, and certainly you might want to think about it as well,
[01:42:06.650 --> 01:42:22.679]  And get your supporters to think about how we need to start having investment procedures so that we can protect ourselves at the collapse of the medias that are going to collapse as a result of what Trump is doing.
[01:42:22.679 --> 01:42:28.263]  Because a number of institutions that are presently standing are not going to stand on the Trump presidency.
[01:42:28.783 --> 01:42:41.171]  I've said so, and everybody listening to me on our broadcast know, I've said that your ministry, Alex Jones Infowars, will be number one when ABC and others go out of business.
[01:42:41.171 --> 01:42:53.800]  You have been bringing the truth, the news, to people without being paid for by the advertisers or the lobbyists or politicians that will not come on your broadcast unless you give a particular point of view of support for them.
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:58.163]  So I think what I'd like to say to our audience is this, is that we need to get prepared.
[01:42:59.043 --> 01:43:13.634]  To be better, to be stronger financially, to be able to pick up the mantle as I think the mantle will fall into our laps in not too many days with what Trump is doing to every aspect of the established order.
[01:43:13.634 --> 01:43:14.194]  So astute.
[01:43:14.194 --> 01:43:16.456]  I've got to have you on more because you're so on target.
[01:43:16.456 --> 01:43:18.398]  The whole facade has already collapsed.
[01:43:18.398 --> 01:43:21.480]  They just don't know it yet and they're only digging their grave faster.
[01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:23.941]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:43:23.941 --> 01:43:24.762]  Absolutely.
[01:43:24.762 --> 01:43:30.806]  And Trump has no power giving them the shovel and the place to throw the dirt.
[01:43:30.806 --> 01:43:34.088]  What do you think Trump's place is already in history?
[01:43:34.088 --> 01:43:38.431]  I mean, for whatever reason, he is just devastating them on every front.
[01:43:38.431 --> 01:43:41.313]  What is your view overall of how Trump's doing and where this is going?
[01:43:41.313 --> 01:43:42.955]  Because I'm really concerned for his safety.
[01:43:43.875 --> 01:43:49.541]  I am too, and I don't like to talk a lot about it because I don't want to give people ideas, but I am proudful.
[01:43:49.541 --> 01:43:52.804]  Therefore, I would ask everybody else to be concerned.
[01:43:52.804 --> 01:43:54.866]  But Trump is a revolutionary.
[01:43:54.866 --> 01:43:58.690]  When I look at Trump,
[01:43:59.751 --> 01:44:04.036]  And I look at George Washington, and everybody please listen to me very carefully.
[01:44:04.036 --> 01:44:07.120]  I'm not trying to raise a man above his stature.
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:08.161]  It doesn't profit me.
[01:44:08.161 --> 01:44:11.104]  I've been living too long to do such.
[01:44:11.104 --> 01:44:20.454]  But when I look at how George Washington handled the establishment of King George and when the revolution was called that we needed to be set free
[01:44:21.115 --> 01:44:27.780]  From England and its tyranny over us as a free and independent people.
[01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:34.724]  And Washington was able to lead a fierce battle to have that happen in the Revolutionary War and then become the president.
[01:44:34.724 --> 01:44:36.946]  You know, when I look at Donald Trump,
[01:44:37.586 --> 01:44:48.814]  Taking back 200 years, back to the 17th, 1800s, and put on him a military suit like George Washington, I think we're cooking with the same gas, if you will.
[01:44:48.814 --> 01:44:54.098]  And Trump is stirring up the hearts of the revolution of Americans.
[01:44:54.098 --> 01:44:58.161]  Listen, Alex, we want to take our nation back from the globalists.
[01:44:58.161 --> 01:45:00.142]  We want to take our nation back.
[01:45:00.142 --> 01:45:02.224]  And Trump is our leader right now.
[01:45:02.264 --> 01:45:05.567]  And he's saying it and he knows it and inside baseball he knows even more.
[01:45:05.567 --> 01:45:09.852]  He is on the same page as us and that's why the enemy is so scared to death of him.
[01:45:09.852 --> 01:45:12.134]  They know he's not just acting like a populist.
[01:45:12.134 --> 01:45:15.878]  They know from the dossiers on him and the rest of it that he's been aware of this.
[01:45:15.878 --> 01:45:18.700]  He gave money against NAFTA and GATT 25 years ago.
[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:20.102]  He hates it all.
[01:45:20.102 --> 01:45:23.906]  He has been basically under the radar and so they know and they're scared.
[01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:38.946]  Yeah, and I think the American people have been, we've not seen such an excitement in the American people in a very, very long time in this nation.
[01:45:38.946 --> 01:45:40.587]  It's been a very long time.
[01:45:40.587 --> 01:45:43.028]  Reagan did not bring this kind of excitement.
[01:45:43.028 --> 01:45:51.472]  I know people gradually kind of gravitated to Reagan, but he wasn't a firebrand starting out.
[01:45:52.132 --> 01:45:52.213]  The
[01:46:06.749 --> 01:46:14.355]  We are Americans demanding our constitutional rights, demanding the freedom of excessive taxation.
[01:46:14.355 --> 01:46:21.580]  We are Americans again demanding that the government works for us rather than tyranny towards us.
[01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:24.182]  This is exciting what Trump is doing.
[01:46:25.376 --> 01:46:32.262]  Speaking of that, let's play a clip from The View today, and the full video is on Infowars.com.
[01:46:32.262 --> 01:46:37.246]  It's about eight minutes long, but here's just a snippet of them talking about Trump being right about Brussels, Belgium.
[01:46:37.246 --> 01:46:37.567]  Here it is.
[01:46:38.376 --> 01:46:40.317]  And let me also say this about Donald Trump.
[01:46:40.317 --> 01:46:42.737]  You know, we trash him often here.
[01:46:42.737 --> 01:46:46.158]  Bottom line is, in January, and you've been saying that, Raven.
[01:46:46.158 --> 01:46:46.858]  I've been saying that.
[01:46:46.858 --> 01:46:50.579]  In January of this year, he said Brussels was a hellhole.
[01:46:50.579 --> 01:46:55.581]  And this is an interview with Maria Bariteromo on, I believe, CNBC.
[01:46:56.101 --> 01:46:57.482]  I could be wrong about that.
[01:46:57.482 --> 01:47:00.343]  He said there is something going on, Maria, and it is not good.
[01:47:00.343 --> 01:47:04.364]  Talking about Belgium, where they want Sharia law, where they want this, where they want that.
[01:47:04.364 --> 01:47:05.965]  You know there has to be some assimilation.
[01:47:05.965 --> 01:47:06.905]  There is no assimilation.
[01:47:06.905 --> 01:47:07.926]  You go to Brussels.
[01:47:07.926 --> 01:47:09.906]  I was in Brussels a long time ago, 20 years ago.
[01:47:09.906 --> 01:47:10.446]  So beautiful.
[01:47:10.446 --> 01:47:11.907]  Everything was beautiful.
[01:47:11.907 --> 01:47:14.248]  Now it's like living in a hellhole.
[01:47:14.548 --> 01:47:15.989]  He said that in January.
[01:47:15.989 --> 01:47:20.650]  He was right about the fact that we went into Iraq, which was a huge mistake and part of the problem.
[01:47:20.650 --> 01:47:21.171]  He was right.
[01:47:21.171 --> 01:47:22.451]  So he's right on a couple of things.
[01:47:22.451 --> 01:47:25.072]  So his foreign policy isn't so outrageous.
[01:47:25.072 --> 01:47:27.133]  You know, we were talking about this in the makeup room.
[01:47:27.133 --> 01:47:29.974]  Did we ever think that Donald Trump would be the voice of reason?
[01:47:29.974 --> 01:47:35.716]  I think his reputation and the fear that so many people have of him is that he's got the nuclear code.
[01:47:35.716 --> 01:47:37.077]  He's got his finger on the button.
[01:47:37.077 --> 01:47:37.837]  She throws that back in.
[01:47:38.683 --> 01:47:39.063]  I don't know.
[01:48:01.008 --> 01:48:07.633]  The hoax of trying to act like he was bad to say these common sense things, Pastor Manning, I see it beginning to implode.
[01:48:07.633 --> 01:48:09.354]  No, he was absolutely right.
[01:48:09.354 --> 01:48:10.515]  He was absolutely right.
[01:48:10.515 --> 01:48:11.135]  I knew it.
[01:48:11.135 --> 01:48:20.321]  There was not a scintilla of daylight between me and my agreement with Trump when he said what we should do with Muslims in terms of them coming into this nation.
[01:48:20.321 --> 01:48:21.262]  He was absolutely right.
[01:48:21.262 --> 01:48:23.804]  And any reasonable thinking person
[01:48:24.284 --> 01:48:41.181]  Who loves this nation, or even who loves Islam, would say, yes, we ought to make sure we clear, we sort out what the problems are, learn how to deal with this issue before we continue to allow the floodgates to be open, not knowing what we're getting.
[01:48:41.181 --> 01:48:41.722]  He's right!
[01:48:42.402 --> 01:48:48.045]  It was those liberal, if you will, bleeding hearts that rose up against Trump.
[01:48:48.045 --> 01:48:53.629]  But even now, people like these old uber-liberals on The View are beginning to say, hey, he's right.
[01:48:53.629 --> 01:49:07.057]  And I guarantee you, if we have an event of terrorism in America on the order, on the American scale order, as that they're having in either in Paris or in Brussels, you're going to see many other people
[01:49:07.757 --> 01:49:16.220]  So what is Obama and the Democratic Party and others thinking when they bring in hundreds of thousands of these people knowing it's only a matter of time until somebody attacks?
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:17.640]  We already saw San Bernardino.
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:19.781]  What's the calculus there?
[01:49:19.781 --> 01:49:25.523]  Well, I had a person on our broadcast and I'm so embarrassed I can't think of his name right now.
[01:49:25.523 --> 01:49:35.046]  He's a very good friend of mine who is Israeli and he has been watching the Islamic progression now for several years.
[01:49:35.766 --> 01:49:59.647]  And he has told me that the chatter that he's picked up over the years is that Obama wishes to flood America with thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of Muslims, displace our culture, give them a new place to set up mosques and to practice their religion, and push Christianity and, if you will, middle Americans to the curb.
[01:49:59.647 --> 01:50:00.868]  And that's Obama's plan.
[01:50:01.368 --> 01:50:02.309]  I mean, the West is weak.
[01:50:02.309 --> 01:50:03.750]  We don't have a culture now.
[01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:10.534]  We've given up on God, taken Christ out, and now we're going to bring the Wahhabist religion of enslavement of women in.
[01:50:10.534 --> 01:50:10.794]  Right.
[01:50:10.794 --> 01:50:11.695]  That's what he said.
[01:50:11.695 --> 01:50:14.036]  And he's been saying that, and he will not back down from that.
[01:50:14.036 --> 01:50:22.362]  And leftist women at universities, almost to a woman, line up, and Gloria Steinem wouldn't even criticize even radical Islam when she was on with Bill Maher.
[01:50:23.851 --> 01:50:28.875]  We see where that's going to take us, and we see exactly how that's happening.
[01:50:28.875 --> 01:50:34.319]  But Donald Trump, perhaps may be our only way in which to recourse this.
[01:50:34.319 --> 01:50:45.908]  I would like to know more about Obama's plan towards either getting the GOP to stop Donald Trump, because otherwise Donald Trump stops his plans completely.
[01:50:45.908 --> 01:50:49.091]  He does not plan to allow- So he throws a big old-
[01:50:59.854 --> 01:51:04.035]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[01:51:04.035 --> 01:51:10.237]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[01:51:10.237 --> 01:51:11.978]  How is this even possible?
[01:51:11.978 --> 01:51:19.280]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:27.506]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[01:51:27.506 --> 01:51:31.869]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[01:51:31.869 --> 01:51:40.635]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[01:51:40.635 --> 01:51:42.216]  But you must act fast.
[01:51:42.216 --> 01:51:46.759]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard, our supply is extremely limited right now.
[01:51:47.039 --> 01:51:52.983]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[01:51:52.983 --> 01:51:56.406]  That's Greens75.com.

[01:51:59.268 --> 01:52:02.711]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:04.130]  It's true.
[01:52:04.130 --> 01:52:08.293]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:52:08.293 --> 01:52:10.674]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:52:10.674 --> 01:52:15.457]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:11.452]  Every day I see articles that show the discrimination against conservatives, Christians, Libertarians, anti-Satans basically.
[01:54:24.807 --> 01:54:29.951]  Pepsi, Visa, and Chevron are exempt from Health and Human Services mandate, which is huge.
[01:54:29.951 --> 01:54:31.151]  Tax, basically.
[01:54:31.151 --> 01:54:34.014]  But Little Sisters of the Poor are not, see?
[01:54:34.014 --> 01:54:36.415]  Any real charity, any Christian group.
[01:54:36.415 --> 01:54:45.642]  In the last five years, Obama's issued one Christian charity, 501c3, that was conservative, and tens of thousands of, quote, liberals.
[01:54:45.642 --> 01:54:48.023]  See how this works?
[01:54:48.023 --> 01:54:50.305]  This is total takeover.
[01:54:50.305 --> 01:54:51.306]  That story's from Life News.
[01:54:51.306 --> 01:54:54.268]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com and Infowars.com.
[01:54:55.438 --> 01:55:03.323]  But it just shows how, oh, thousands of big companies are exempt from Obamacare, but your company isn't, meaning that it makes it where you can't compete.
[01:55:03.323 --> 01:55:09.986]  A mom-and-pop hamburger place isn't exempt, but McDonald's is.
[01:55:09.986 --> 01:55:12.568]  We're all busy thinking about skin color as discriminatory.
[01:55:12.568 --> 01:55:20.012]  That's why they try to drive it in our heads all day, because that goes on, but nothing like the New World Order that's exempt from taxes and above the law.
[01:55:20.012 --> 01:55:20.953]  I want to go to David.
[01:55:21.994 --> 01:55:30.424]  Kyle, Steven, Mike, Robert, Mr. Manning, Pastor James David Manning will be with us 15 minutes in or 20 minutes into the next hour.
[01:55:30.424 --> 01:55:31.465]  We appreciate that.
[01:55:31.465 --> 01:55:39.394]  Then I've got so much other news coming up as well and a bunch of special reports I haven't haven't hit yet, but right now let's go ahead and go
[01:55:40.714 --> 01:55:46.319]  To your phone calls, let's go ahead and talk to some folks in Washington.
[01:55:46.319 --> 01:55:50.403]  Kyle, he wants to talk about Obama and his Islamic ring.
[01:55:50.403 --> 01:55:51.705]  Yeah, the media says that's debunked.
[01:55:51.705 --> 01:56:03.436]  No, it's just he wears an Arabic-Islamic ring, he speaks perfect Arabic, his first speech was in Cairo, a bunch of his family are Muslims, and he badmouths Christianity every Easter.
[01:56:03.436 --> 01:56:05.258]  So let's get your question on that, Kyle, go ahead.
[01:56:06.545 --> 01:56:08.046]  Oh yeah, I find it very interesting.
[01:56:08.046 --> 01:56:13.909]  I mean, he's worn this ring even before he got married and his colleagues found it odd.
[01:56:13.909 --> 01:56:18.132]  And the ring actually says, there is no God except Allah.
[01:56:18.132 --> 01:56:21.634]  So when you were just saying, you know, he can't even be seen next to a cross.
[01:56:22.165 --> 01:56:30.167]  I mean, this guy clearly has all the ties to Islamic beliefs, to Islamic religion, and still won't even call it radicalized Islam.
[01:56:30.167 --> 01:56:30.908]  And it's just ridiculous.
[01:56:30.908 --> 01:56:36.289]  Sure, well, they say Napoleon converted near the end, but then got beat for an alliance to Islam.
[01:56:36.289 --> 01:56:51.114]  But I wonder if this is another bait-and-switch to create a class of civilizations, or is Obama, with his shadowy CIA history, and his mom, and his tranny, a nanny, and then in Arabic schools, I mean, in any Muslim school, they'd kill a tranny.
[01:56:51.715 --> 01:56:53.542]  What do you think's going on here, Manning?
[01:56:53.542 --> 01:56:57.136]  Pastor Manning, is he really a Muslim or is he just something else?
[01:56:57.691 --> 01:56:58.792]  Well, I can tell you this.
[01:56:58.792 --> 01:57:00.192]  What's his name?
[01:57:00.192 --> 01:57:00.973]  What's his name?
[01:57:00.973 --> 01:57:02.713]  Barack Hussein Obama.
[01:57:02.713 --> 01:57:04.314]  Well, how Muslim is that?
[01:57:04.314 --> 01:57:07.976]  I mean, you don't get any more Muslim than that.
[01:57:07.976 --> 01:57:14.279]  And his ring is simply an insignia of who he is.
[01:57:14.279 --> 01:57:16.320]  And you know, our names are very important, Alex.
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:18.301]  They say a lot about us.
[01:57:18.301 --> 01:57:19.641]  They are very powerful.
[01:57:19.641 --> 01:57:21.182]  I can tell you probably came from Christians.
[01:57:21.182 --> 01:57:21.822]  Your name's David.
[01:57:21.822 --> 01:57:22.623]  My dad's name's David.
[01:57:23.243 --> 01:57:23.983]  Right.
[01:57:23.983 --> 01:57:26.404]  So, there you have it.
[01:57:26.404 --> 01:57:39.429]  So his ring is simply, if you will, his name rather, demonstrates that he will, that's why he's wearing that ring, that there is no other god than Allah, and he has this very profound Islamic name.
[01:57:39.429 --> 01:57:41.390]  I've never heard you put it so good.
[01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:42.991]  Nobody ever made that point.
[01:57:42.991 --> 01:57:45.832]  His name, his name is bigger than the ring.
[01:57:45.832 --> 01:57:48.393]  It's Barack Hussein Obama.
[01:57:48.393 --> 01:57:49.393]  There you have it.
[01:57:49.393 --> 01:57:51.034]  What am I going to say next?
[01:57:51.034 --> 01:57:51.734]  I mean, there you have it.
[01:57:53.413 --> 01:57:54.013]  It's incredible.
[01:57:54.013 --> 01:57:56.875]  So he... So it's not just a CIA cover.
[01:57:56.875 --> 01:58:00.296]  You think he... A lot of insiders believe... I mean, I'm talking high-level Pentagon.
[01:58:00.296 --> 01:58:01.516]  They say no.
[01:58:01.516 --> 01:58:02.457]  Secret Service, you name it.
[01:58:02.457 --> 01:58:05.758]  The word is, he actually gets down before Mecca every day.
[01:58:05.758 --> 01:58:12.321]  Well, I think that we need to understand that the CIA is not necessarily a patriot organization, nor a Christian organization.
[01:58:12.321 --> 01:58:18.764]  I think they're a globalist-inspired organization, and their allegiance would be to Islam as well as anybody else.
[01:58:18.764 --> 01:58:21.025]  I mean, though they're financed by American tax dollars.
[01:58:21.505 --> 01:58:22.526]  We need to be clear about that.
[01:58:49.358 --> 01:58:54.440]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[01:59:51.286 --> 02:00:09.191]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:09.191 --> 02:00:15.433]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:18.756 --> 02:00:22.320]  Alright, Patrick Manning's with us to the end of the next segment.
[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:26.303]  This is a short segment and a 12-minute segment coming up.
[02:00:26.303 --> 02:00:36.532]  I'm not apologizing for the fact some days I get real excited, but I'm like somebody running around trying to warn my neighbors their house is on fire and they're not listening to me and now they're on fire.
[02:00:36.532 --> 02:00:39.535]  And then next my house is going to be on fire.
[02:00:39.535 --> 02:00:41.477]  So it's not even I'm a goody two-shoes empathy.
[02:00:41.477 --> 02:00:44.439]  I do have empathy, but seeing people get screwed over
[02:00:45.523 --> 02:00:49.907]  You know, seeing somebody get run over, I've seen somebody get hit by a car before, and you have empathy for them.
[02:00:49.907 --> 02:00:51.949]  It feels horrible.
[02:00:51.949 --> 02:00:53.671]  And I just don't get where the empathy is.
[02:00:53.671 --> 02:01:04.522]  And I think so much of what's happening in our civilization is that we're losing empathy, and that's being done by the system so that we don't want to do unto others as we would have them do unto us.
[02:01:04.522 --> 02:01:07.245]  I mean, the Golden Rule makes a lot of sense, doesn't it, Pastor Manning?
[02:01:07.910 --> 02:01:09.371]  Well, absolutely.
[02:01:09.371 --> 02:01:19.295]  But one of the reasons for that, Alex, not the ultimate reason and the only reason, but there's a biblical phrase about people becoming at ease and Zion.
[02:01:19.295 --> 02:01:23.477]  America has become or had become so prosperous and so powerful.
[02:01:23.477 --> 02:01:31.481]  I mean, it was like on overdrive and everybody who simply put their heart to the American dream prospered.
[02:01:31.841 --> 02:01:40.785]  And so at that point we stopped defending our borders, we stopped thinking about how precious our Constitution is, our Bill of Rights.
[02:01:40.785 --> 02:01:50.909]  The thing that brought us to that point of great prosperity, great wealth, Harold is the greatest nation in civilization ever, we just became very much at ease.
[02:01:50.909 --> 02:01:56.431]  It's like having a super gorgeous nice girlfriend for four or five years, you start taking her for granted, pretty soon she's gone.
[02:01:56.431 --> 02:01:59.733]  Right, and that's exactly what happened to us.
[02:02:00.713 --> 02:02:02.714]  Um, and so we need to reclaim that.
[02:02:02.714 --> 02:02:14.580]  We need to look at how that has taken place and try to come back to, try to get that girlfriend back and then learn how to treat her the right way, treat her like a lady when we do get her back.
[02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:21.903]  Wow, I want to go to break so we have plenty of time to take these calls and not interrupt you, but the three minutes we've got left before we go to break, you've used so many amazing points.
[02:02:21.903 --> 02:02:24.765]  What else is on your radar that you haven't imparted to folks, Pastor Manning?
[02:02:25.928 --> 02:02:30.271]  I mean, again, our prayers are for Donald Trump.
[02:02:30.271 --> 02:02:41.878]  We have a Harlem for Trump campaign here, Alex, right here in Harlem, where we're actively campaigning to get people to vote for Trump in the primary and also in the general.
[02:02:41.878 --> 02:02:45.000]  We're telling people in this community where you've got 53% unemployment.
[02:02:46.781 --> 02:02:50.063]  In this community, that Trump can put you back to work again.
[02:02:50.063 --> 02:03:01.288]  We're getting people ready to be trained as air conditioner repair people, refrigeration, plumbers, electricians, landscape architect people.
[02:03:01.288 --> 02:03:09.192]  Under the Trump campaign and Trump bringing jobs back from India and China is going to put America back and put Harlem back to work again.
[02:03:09.192 --> 02:03:10.033]  Want to talk about that?
[02:03:11.049 --> 02:03:13.251]  Well that's exciting and I don't want to get off this diversion.
[02:03:13.251 --> 02:03:16.914]  They still ask him why he won't disavow the Klan after he's done it over a hundred times.
[02:03:16.914 --> 02:03:18.116]  He always had.
[02:03:18.116 --> 02:03:20.298]  They just lied and said he hadn't.
[02:03:20.298 --> 02:03:24.021]  And you know there he was having a great history working with everybody.
[02:03:24.021 --> 02:03:29.266]  It just shows how what liars they are that they keep just injecting race this race that.
[02:03:29.266 --> 02:03:34.350]  But I've seen in polls he gets double the black vote of what Mitt Romney did in national polls.
[02:03:34.350 --> 02:03:36.633]  So at least some black people out there are figuring this out.
[02:03:37.634 --> 02:03:46.404]  On the day that he was pummeled on this issue of the Klan, I talked with Michael Cohen, who is Trump's very special assistant.
[02:03:46.404 --> 02:03:52.211]  We have been going back and forth over the last couple of weeks talking personally over several items going on here in New York City.
[02:03:52.211 --> 02:03:54.834]  And Michael and I both agreed.
[02:03:54.834 --> 02:03:56.216]  Trump handled the question.
[02:03:56.736 --> 02:04:10.371]  He indicated that he denied the white supremacy idea and the Klan and David Duke in a manner that was respectful if there was a respectful reporter to report it.
[02:04:10.371 --> 02:04:12.513]  The problem is, however, I pointed out to Michael Cohen,
[02:04:13.374 --> 02:04:19.396]  Is that, listen, David Duke has a right to vote for, he's still a citizen, whether you like his policies or not.
[02:04:19.396 --> 02:04:23.518]  Whether you like his politics, and I don't agree with David Duke, but he's still a citizen.
[02:04:23.518 --> 02:04:29.380]  And if he wants to vote for Donald Trump, and wants to make it a public statement he wants for Donald Trump, what the hell is Donald Trump supposed to do?
[02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:30.621]  Don't vote for me?
[02:04:30.621 --> 02:04:32.202]  Because I don't like your policies?
[02:04:32.202 --> 02:04:35.203]  Then there'll be a whole lot of people that will be exorcised from the voting system.
[02:04:36.314 --> 02:04:41.277]  Just a pure, dirty stunt, but then even after he kept disavowing, they kept saying, why won't you disavow?
[02:04:41.277 --> 02:04:47.680]  One time at the same press conference, three reporters, almost in a row, but the third one, he went, I just did it!
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:48.841]  Oh, you're going to edit this?
[02:04:48.841 --> 02:04:50.361]  Yes, I disavowed again.
[02:04:50.361 --> 02:04:53.183]  Playing this game, hoping he would say, I just disavowed it.
[02:04:53.183 --> 02:04:56.365]  I tell you, they are so dirty, and the American people are seeing through it.
[02:04:56.365 --> 02:04:57.785]  Your calls are three minutes away.
[02:04:57.785 --> 02:04:58.205]  Stay with us.
[02:04:58.205 --> 02:04:59.086]  Mike, David, and others.
[02:04:59.246 --> 02:05:12.623]  The left-leaning women from the popular daytime TV show, The View, are finally starting to admit that they agree with Donald Trump on his foreign policy and views on ISIS.
[02:05:12.623 --> 02:05:14.826]  I thought Donald Trump sounded really reasonable today.
[02:05:15.026 --> 02:05:17.288]  My law enforcement background kicked in.
[02:05:17.288 --> 02:05:18.229]  Isn't that crazy?
[02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:20.730]  Because we need to be forceful.
[02:05:20.730 --> 02:05:24.093]  We can't have these muted responses to terror.
[02:05:24.093 --> 02:05:26.115]  And let me also say this about Donald Trump.
[02:05:26.115 --> 02:05:28.597]  You know, we trash him often here.
[02:05:28.597 --> 02:05:31.999]  Bottom line is, in January, and you've been saying that.
[02:05:31.999 --> 02:05:32.840]  I've been saying that.
[02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:36.603]  In January of this year, he said Brussels was a hellhole.
[02:05:36.603 --> 02:05:39.685]  He said there is something going on, Maria, and it is not good.
[02:05:39.685 --> 02:05:40.446]  Talking about that.
[02:05:41.087 --> 02:05:48.035]  So is Donald Trump really the voice of reason?
[02:05:48.035 --> 02:05:50.558]  And which candidate makes you feel safer?
[02:05:50.558 --> 02:05:53.141]  Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?
[02:05:53.141 --> 02:05:57.687]  Let us know what you think in the comments section right now at InfoWars.com
[02:05:59.028 --> 02:05:59.968]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:05:59.968 --> 02:06:00.549]  Good, brother.
[02:06:00.549 --> 02:06:02.269]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:06:02.269 --> 02:06:04.210]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:06:04.210 --> 02:06:08.252]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:06:08.252 --> 02:06:10.853]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:06:10.853 --> 02:06:13.274]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:06:13.274 --> 02:06:21.137]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:06:21.457 --> 02:06:24.680]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:26.241]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:06:26.241 --> 02:06:29.263]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:06:29.263 --> 02:06:30.904]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:06:30.904 --> 02:06:33.647]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[02:06:33.647 --> 02:06:36.729]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[02:06:37.009 --> 02:06:38.770]  Or maximum potency.
[02:06:38.770 --> 02:06:48.974]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going, goes right to the source.
[02:06:48.974 --> 02:06:50.755]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[02:06:50.755 --> 02:06:57.698]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:07:00.245 --> 02:07:04.027]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:07:04.027 --> 02:07:11.752]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:07:11.752 --> 02:07:20.397]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:07:20.397 --> 02:07:24.399]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:07:24.779 --> 02:07:34.624]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:07:34.624 --> 02:07:38.046]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[02:07:38.046 --> 02:07:49.072]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[02:07:49.172 --> 02:07:52.054]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[02:07:52.054 --> 02:07:55.156]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[02:07:55.156 --> 02:07:58.058]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[02:08:00.424 --> 02:08:06.990]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:06.990 --> 02:08:07.170]  Well,
[02:08:26.545 --> 02:08:32.674]  Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, has come out and said something that I actually agree with.
[02:08:32.674 --> 02:08:34.778]  This will be a day long remembered.
[02:08:34.778 --> 02:08:38.583]  Giuliani, Hillary Clinton, could be considered a founding member of ISIS.
[02:08:40.273 --> 02:08:42.154]  Trump has already begun to talk about this.
[02:08:42.154 --> 02:08:49.200]  It's a fact that she funded Al Qaeda in Syria and in Libya and in Egypt.
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:51.041]  I mean, we have her red-handed.
[02:08:51.041 --> 02:08:52.162]  That's what Benghazi is.
[02:08:52.162 --> 02:08:53.083]  This is so big.
[02:08:53.083 --> 02:08:55.725]  That's from CNN News, of all places.
[02:08:55.725 --> 02:08:56.966]  This is massive.
[02:08:56.966 --> 02:09:00.629]  And of course, we have Donald Trump tweeting out an interview I did with Roger Stone.
[02:09:01.949 --> 02:09:02.349]  I don't
[02:09:18.356 --> 02:09:31.259]  They're going to be breaking some big news here on Monday, because they know the media likes to come attack the info here, as if it's discredited if it's said here, when actually it only blasted out more if it's said here, which shows the arrogance.
[02:09:31.259 --> 02:09:34.700]  Pastor, I want to go right to these calls, but you're right in the belly of the beast there in New York City.
[02:09:34.700 --> 02:09:38.420]  You're showing you're very astute with your predictions and the things you say.
[02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:41.041]  I mean, I really am genuinely wanting your opinion.
[02:09:42.042 --> 02:09:44.985]  You talk about the death of the mainstream media is nigh.
[02:09:44.985 --> 02:09:48.868]  I agree they're already collapsing, but they still are incredibly arrogant.
[02:09:48.868 --> 02:09:53.813]  They still don't seem to know how things work or how hated they are.
[02:09:53.813 --> 02:10:00.439]  I think that's really our biggest leg up is that I don't think they realize yet that they've already fallen.
[02:10:00.439 --> 02:10:03.002]  I think Humpty Dumpty still thinks he's up on that wall.
[02:10:04.093 --> 02:10:13.463]  What the problem is with them is that they cannot confess, they cannot repent and confess and come clean because they've committed so many crimes.
[02:10:13.463 --> 02:10:20.371]  They're better off taking their shot with arrogance and trying to maintain the status quo, hoping their problem will go away.
[02:10:20.911 --> 02:10:24.373]  But they can't just turn around and confess and say, this is what we've done.
[02:10:24.373 --> 02:10:27.135]  This is how we've manipulated the American people.
[02:10:27.135 --> 02:10:30.777]  We've manipulated the news, manipulated politics.
[02:10:30.777 --> 02:10:32.938]  They can't do that, Alex.
[02:10:32.938 --> 02:10:35.780]  It's just deadly if they did.
[02:10:35.780 --> 02:10:46.326]  So they'd rather take their chance on being arrogant and hoping that they can drain every ounce of another minute of life and their so-called freedom and prosperity and power that they can.
[02:10:46.326 --> 02:10:47.507]  They're not going to repent.
[02:10:47.507 --> 02:10:48.388]  They're not going to confess.
[02:10:48.968 --> 02:10:52.994]  Remember Gruber came out in six different clips, or more now, and said...
[02:10:53.991 --> 02:10:54.992]  The public are idiots.
[02:10:54.992 --> 02:10:55.853]  Good thing they're dumb.
[02:10:55.853 --> 02:10:56.894]  Good thing they don't pay attention.
[02:10:56.894 --> 02:11:01.017]  I met with Obama on ways to lie and triple prices.
[02:11:01.017 --> 02:11:08.103]  He adopted my plan and all these PhDs are worshipping him because they're learning how to be liars and get jobs.
[02:11:08.103 --> 02:11:12.968]  You don't learn how to build a better health care plan or have better metrics to get a job.
[02:11:12.968 --> 02:11:16.071]  It's now about being the most deceitful devil in the room.
[02:11:16.071 --> 02:11:20.855]  But Gruber didn't get the memo that you're not supposed to go on C-SPAN and brag about it to everybody.
[02:11:22.878 --> 02:11:24.479]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:11:24.479 --> 02:11:25.720]  He didn't.
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:42.169]  But these things happen, and Alex, at some point in time, if you and I and others continue to do what we're doing, somebody's going to have not, would not have gotten a memo about Obama's ineligibility, his shadowy involvement in the CIA.
[02:11:42.169 --> 02:11:43.310]  Somebody's going to come out.
[02:11:43.570 --> 02:11:45.273]  And speak about that as well.
[02:11:45.273 --> 02:11:50.199]  You can't keep all of that information under lock and key.
[02:11:50.199 --> 02:11:55.747]  At some point, somebody's going to slip and we're going to hear some things that you've been talking about for years.
[02:11:56.547 --> 02:11:57.027]  Well, that's right.
[02:11:57.027 --> 02:12:00.889]  They tried to intimidate whistleblowers, but more and more, so many people are speaking out.
[02:12:00.889 --> 02:12:01.969]  They can't stop everybody.
[02:12:01.969 --> 02:12:03.110]  I've been visited and threatened.
[02:12:03.110 --> 02:12:05.491]  You've been visited and threatened by the government.
[02:12:05.491 --> 02:12:09.252]  And, you know, I just laugh and say, and usually they're like, we don't like doing this.
[02:12:09.252 --> 02:12:10.092]  We're just told to come here.
[02:12:10.092 --> 02:12:11.993]  I'm like, yeah, the country's collapsing.
[02:12:11.993 --> 02:12:13.994]  Why don't you go do something more important?
[02:12:13.994 --> 02:12:17.815]  I know you've had those visits and it's just crazy.
[02:12:17.815 --> 02:12:21.197]  Were the people that visited you on a power trip or do they look kind of ashamed of themselves?
[02:12:22.245 --> 02:12:34.373]  You know, when they came, they brought not only the government officials, the CIA group, but they recruited members of the local police department to come to flank our church and to walk in with them.
[02:12:34.373 --> 02:12:43.719]  And I suppose they thought it was a racial thing, so they brought several high-ranking African-American black police officers to pave the way.
[02:12:43.719 --> 02:12:47.182]  They didn't come by themselves, but they asked the questions.
[02:12:47.802 --> 02:12:49.023]  Think about that.
[02:12:49.023 --> 02:12:54.105]  The CIA scared to come talk to a well-known, loving black preacher.
[02:12:54.105 --> 02:12:55.786]  I mean, how cowardly is that?
[02:12:55.786 --> 02:12:57.327]  Well, that's what they did.
[02:12:57.327 --> 02:12:58.347]  They did not come by.
[02:12:58.347 --> 02:13:00.288]  They brought the local police department with them.
[02:13:00.288 --> 02:13:02.329]  I mean, I would be so comfortable walking into a black church.
[02:13:02.329 --> 02:13:03.370]  Been in many of them growing up.
[02:13:03.370 --> 02:13:05.531]  I mean, these people are so disconnected from reality.
[02:13:06.476 --> 02:13:08.137]  I'm going to tell you.
[02:13:08.137 --> 02:13:12.839]  But you know, they were kind of like, we're just doing our job.
[02:13:12.839 --> 02:13:17.541]  I don't know if we necessarily dislike you or hate you, but we've been told to come and check you out.
[02:13:17.541 --> 02:13:18.401]  And that's what they did.
[02:13:18.401 --> 02:13:19.842]  They weren't arrogant.
[02:13:19.842 --> 02:13:24.564]  You know, they weren't, you know, like we were going to arrest you or anything of that nature.
[02:13:24.564 --> 02:13:28.385]  Sure, it was just an attempt to intimidate because it was their orders and didn't work too well, did it?
[02:13:28.385 --> 02:13:31.727]  I think you've upped what you've done probably five times since then.
[02:13:31.727 --> 02:13:32.647]  I've gotten even bolder.
[02:13:32.647 --> 02:13:33.387]  You're right.
[02:13:33.387 --> 02:13:34.488]  I mean, I've gone off the chain.
[02:13:35.468 --> 02:13:36.890]  Since that experience.
[02:13:36.890 --> 02:13:38.991]  So, it didn't help them.
[02:13:38.991 --> 02:13:39.772]  I don't know what it is.
[02:13:39.772 --> 02:13:41.814]  When I get threatened, it's not even like a one-up.
[02:13:41.814 --> 02:13:43.415]  I can't help it, I get more bold.
[02:13:43.415 --> 02:13:45.738]  I get more energy.
[02:13:45.738 --> 02:13:46.979]  It's crazy.
[02:13:46.979 --> 02:13:50.662]  I don't appreciate being threatened, first of all, by anything or anybody.
[02:13:50.662 --> 02:14:00.130]  I just don't like people saying to me that they're going to have a power over me unless I act a particular way.
[02:14:00.811 --> 02:14:04.173]  I don't like that from anybody or anything, and I never have.
[02:14:04.173 --> 02:14:07.554]  From the time I was a schoolboy, I just don't like that.
[02:14:07.554 --> 02:14:09.075]  But that's what they did.
[02:14:09.075 --> 02:14:21.221]  They thought that by coming, that I would tone down what I was saying and I would be looking at prison bars and a long prison sentence, and I would abdicate my own integrity to avoid prison.
[02:14:21.221 --> 02:14:22.482]  Nothing could have been further from the truth.
[02:14:22.482 --> 02:14:24.443]  We all know a coward dies a thousand.
[02:14:25.263 --> 02:14:32.534]  And Pastor David J. Manning is our guest, or James David Manning, the stuff that America is made of, with this audience and our great guests.
[02:14:32.534 --> 02:14:34.497]  Let's go to Mike in Texas.
[02:14:34.497 --> 02:14:37.842]  You're on the air with Pastor James David Manning of atla.org.
[02:14:37.842 --> 02:14:38.403]  Go ahead.
[02:14:38.403 --> 02:14:38.864]  Thanks for holding.
[02:14:39.383 --> 02:14:39.803]  Yeah.
[02:14:39.803 --> 02:14:41.184]  Good afternoon, Pastor Manning.
[02:14:41.184 --> 02:14:43.926]  What a great... I love to listen to you talk.
[02:14:43.926 --> 02:14:49.010]  It's what the neighborhoods and neighbors should be sitting down, these types of discussions.
[02:14:49.010 --> 02:14:51.191]  So, thank you for what you do.
[02:14:51.191 --> 02:15:00.338]  The question I had was, why do you think so many Americans and Obama supporters can't see the hypocrisy in his words and actions?
[02:15:00.338 --> 02:15:08.924]  For example, there's this huge movement to label Mr. Trump as Hitler and a Nazi, and in his own words during his campaign,
[02:15:09.494 --> 02:15:16.979]  He stated in direct relation to terrorism that we need a civilian force as big and well-funded as the military.
[02:15:16.979 --> 02:15:20.261]  I mean, that's hypocrisy right there, wouldn't you agree?
[02:15:20.261 --> 02:15:23.443]  You mean the brown shirts theology?
[02:15:23.443 --> 02:15:27.086]  Sure, if you want parallels to Hitler, I mean, isn't Obama a lot more parallels than Trump?
[02:15:28.132 --> 02:15:33.897]  Absolutely, and he did make the brown shirt statement in the early days of his administration.
[02:15:33.897 --> 02:15:46.307]  But I think, Mike, what's happening is that many people that voted for him did so for a religious purpose more so than a political one, and they too cannot walk back.
[02:15:46.907 --> 02:16:00.903]  Uh, the fact that they entered into a spiritual worship of this man that now they'd have to completely state was was a mistake and would make them look like they have no ability to make right decisions.
[02:16:00.903 --> 02:16:05.709]  And so they're holding on to that decision, even though they know it was a wrong decision.
[02:16:07.774 --> 02:16:10.035]  Absolutely, and now they just can't stop.
[02:16:10.035 --> 02:16:16.619]  They're just keep saying Nazi, Nazi, Nazi, Nazi, racist, racist, racist, as if, as if that people are going to buy it.
[02:16:16.619 --> 02:16:17.700]  I don't see it working anymore.
[02:16:17.700 --> 02:16:18.561]  Thank you, Mike.
[02:16:18.561 --> 02:16:22.383]  David in New Jersey, a little bit closer to where James David Manning is up in New York.
[02:16:22.383 --> 02:16:24.444]  Go ahead.
[02:16:24.444 --> 02:16:25.645]  Hey, greetings guys.
[02:16:25.645 --> 02:16:26.586]  I thank God for you both.
[02:16:28.004 --> 02:16:33.126]  Pastor, this is a gospel and a Martin Luther King question, please.
[02:16:33.126 --> 02:16:55.596]  I think the optics of hate against to shut down free speech are so incredible that it's such an opportunity for non-violence to really respond in streets, on these news programs, to really bring what Martin Luther King stood for and really what the Constitution stands for into the limelight.
[02:16:56.246 --> 02:16:57.909]  What do you think about that?
[02:16:57.909 --> 02:17:02.117]  And do you think that there's a way to organize people electronically with a meetup?
[02:17:02.117 --> 02:17:04.521]  Because I don't want to just tell you, give you a new job.
[02:17:04.521 --> 02:17:04.962]  I want to help.
[02:17:06.349 --> 02:17:16.372]  I think that to answer the latter part of your question, the process procedure would be what I would refer to as kitchen tables kind of organization.
[02:17:16.372 --> 02:17:26.795]  The media is not going to give me or Alex the opportunity to demonstrate what is considered free speech.
[02:17:26.795 --> 02:17:29.816]  The media only considers free speech that they like.
[02:17:30.436 --> 02:17:36.600]  They consider anything that they don't approve of as hate speech, though you have the freedom to say it.
[02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:43.725]  But then they say it's hate speech, and they try to null and void it and null and void your constitutional right to say so.
[02:17:43.725 --> 02:17:51.050]  What I would think would be the approach, and what must be the approach, is that we're going to have to get Americans around the kitchen table
[02:17:51.670 --> 02:17:58.734]  Who can then come as family members or friends and talk about the issues in a real and constructive way.
[02:17:58.734 --> 02:18:05.058]  You can't go on your job if you are an attorney or if you are an auto mechanic at Pep Boys.
[02:18:05.058 --> 02:18:16.565]  If you are, if you believe and if you are against Obama, if you're against all of what's happening in our nation, you would then get fired from your job or ostracized if you simply speak your mind.
[02:18:16.565 --> 02:18:21.408]  It has to happen in the confines now of the kitchen table ministry that we've talked about from time to time.
[02:18:21.408 --> 02:18:23.989]  Absolutely, and people don't listen to mainstream media anymore.
[02:18:23.989 --> 02:18:27.230]  Mainstream metrics, marketing info shows that.
[02:18:27.230 --> 02:18:39.194]  So big corporations are spending hundreds of billions in the Western world every year to actually pay focus groups to go out and talk things up at community events, call into radio to write articles, to write reviews.
[02:18:39.614 --> 02:18:50.704]  That's why all of us that love freedom, and love God, and love just basic justice, we have to get active with reviews, and calling into shows, and going to speak at the city council, or going down to a little local church.
[02:18:50.704 --> 02:19:02.795]  You want to defeat racism and the globalist balkanization, there's big movements to do this, go to a predominant white church if you're black, or just a visit, or a black church if you're, you know, white, and break that
[02:19:03.636 --> 02:19:05.658]  That balkanization they're engaged in.
[02:19:05.658 --> 02:19:13.587]  I mean, we should put out a promo piece that shows Martin Luther King saying one thing, and then the globalists saying another thing, and just show how they manipulated it.
[02:19:13.587 --> 02:19:18.372]  But speaking of Obama and his national civilian force, they want this during the collapse.
[02:19:19.293 --> 02:19:32.396]  Everyone out of high school, two years compulsory service, but instead it's going to be acorn-like, community organizing, political correctness under something called Strong Cities of the UN.
[02:19:32.396 --> 02:19:38.878]  Officially announced, mainstream news last year, the UN running your local city, attached to federal dollars.
[02:19:38.878 --> 02:19:42.919]  The feds give the money, but you've got to get the seal of approval from the UN.
[02:19:44.159 --> 02:19:48.481]  And offices are opening right now nationwide to run your city.
[02:19:48.481 --> 02:19:50.502]  Let's go to the clip.
[02:19:50.502 --> 02:19:58.226]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[02:19:58.226 --> 02:20:05.069]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:20:05.689 --> 02:20:08.550]  And then people expect to see it like a foreign army coming over the hill.
[02:20:08.550 --> 02:20:14.493]  No, it's just suddenly local community groups, government funded, directed by the UN, Pastor Manning.
[02:20:14.493 --> 02:20:17.114]  I just, I can't even believe it's happened.
[02:20:17.114 --> 02:20:18.714]  Now, believe it.
[02:20:18.714 --> 02:20:20.275]  Believe it.
[02:20:20.275 --> 02:20:29.699]  When you consider the globalist ideology and this one world nation idea, the United Nations would be the place where the head of the beast would sit.
[02:20:30.539 --> 02:20:35.665]  And so it would start the process of the strongest nation in America.
[02:20:35.665 --> 02:20:39.469]  That's why the UN building needs to get out of New York City, first of all.
[02:20:39.469 --> 02:20:41.471]  And then the other thing, when they come here, they clog up the streets.
[02:20:41.471 --> 02:20:45.455]  You can't buy a hot dog because traffic is so tight.
[02:20:45.455 --> 02:20:51.421]  But on the other hand, the head of the beast would sit at that building under those auspices.
[02:20:51.421 --> 02:20:51.862]  And by the way,
[02:20:52.282 --> 02:21:06.831]  If you ever see a panoramic view of the UN Security Council or the General Assembly, you'll notice most of the heads of state there are Islamic or something other than Western or Christian.
[02:21:06.831 --> 02:21:07.271]  That's right.
[02:21:07.271 --> 02:21:13.936]  Saudi Arabia runs the Human Rights Council when they're probably the second most abusive country in the world after North Korea.
[02:21:14.776 --> 02:21:17.438]  And they run the Rights Council.
[02:21:17.438 --> 02:21:19.259]  I mean, that ought to tell everybody something.
[02:21:19.259 --> 02:21:35.569]  I want to go to a few final calls, but since you mentioned tyranny, and who runs this, what about Obama with Raul Castro, half a million political dissidents, arresting people that just said Libertai, ESPN celebrated as people were drug away and beat up and thrown in police cars.
[02:21:35.569 --> 02:21:37.130]  Where's all the liberal groups there?
[02:21:37.130 --> 02:21:37.671]  Oh, I forgot.
[02:21:38.453 --> 02:21:46.321]  Black Lives Matter's ideological founder is a cop killer and has been in Cuba since the 80s.
[02:21:46.321 --> 02:21:53.468]  And again, we're not saying there aren't some problems with the police folks, but just supporting communist movements that want to shoot random cops in the back of the head, this is crazy.
[02:21:54.349 --> 02:22:16.665]  Her name is Joanne Cheshire Barr, a killer New Jersey State Patrol officer in the dead of night, and then fled down to Cuba, is living a life of luxury and freedom in Cuba, being smuggled out and having boyfriends smuggled into Cuba from time to time to do what they do to her.
[02:22:16.665 --> 02:22:17.666]  She's living a great life!
[02:22:18.126 --> 02:22:20.988]  And Obama goes there, never mentions her name.
[02:22:20.988 --> 02:22:29.632]  And I haven't heard anybody of note of presidential state mentioned Joanne Cheshamar name, but she is a cold-blooded killer.
[02:22:29.632 --> 02:22:41.578]  And I believe she comes back and forth to America from time to time under the auspices of the Cubans that are in Florida and the Cuban protection that she has in Cuba.
[02:22:43.479 --> 02:22:44.140]  I can't prove it.
[02:22:44.140 --> 02:22:52.647]  Well, look at how they won't even criticize communist China now, but they tell us, the biggest mass murderers in history, that, Pastor, that we can't have Donald Trump.
[02:22:52.647 --> 02:23:00.774]  Shouldn't Americans say no to being lectured by all these foreign governments, England, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, that we can't have Donald Trump?
[02:23:00.774 --> 02:23:01.755]  That's globalism right there.
[02:23:02.395 --> 02:23:25.365]  Probably what most Americans, at least I did, I know that Trump is going to pulverize their economy and he's going to make America great again, as he said, through the economic wheel of action that he was going to put into play as a result of removing Chinese power and the jobs that have been shipped to China and India.
[02:23:25.845 --> 02:23:29.567]  And so I really don't see them as a threat anymore.
[02:23:29.567 --> 02:23:41.654]  My prayers right now is to get Trump through the nomination, that process, because he's got the entire political establishment, both Democrat and Republican, scared to death, and the media against him.
[02:23:41.654 --> 02:23:44.156]  If we can get him through this process, I think we'll be home safe.
[02:23:44.156 --> 02:23:45.096]  We're getting you out of here in a few minutes.
[02:23:45.096 --> 02:23:45.737]  We're about to go to break.
[02:23:45.737 --> 02:23:46.897]  Let's jam in two more.
[02:23:46.897 --> 02:23:48.138]  Let's talk to Robert Missouri.
[02:23:48.138 --> 02:23:51.380]  You're on the air with Pastor James David Manning of atla.org.
[02:23:53.734 --> 02:23:56.958]  Hey gentlemen, I wanted to run this scenario by both of you.
[02:23:56.958 --> 02:24:04.508]  The United Nations High Committee on Refugees, there's a corporation called Accenture, and they're contracted with the World Bank as well.
[02:24:04.508 --> 02:24:08.113]  I think they're using this Islamic terror to scare the Europeans.
[02:24:08.593 --> 02:24:12.835]  Into those conversations that you had with Aaron Russo, Alex, before he died.
[02:24:12.835 --> 02:24:17.356]  Oh yeah, they admit it's about a cashless society, banning free speech, but none of the Muslims.
[02:24:17.356 --> 02:24:25.059]  And absolutely, Peter Sutherland, that runs the refugee program, is the creator of the EU, and says, we don't want Western Christian culture.
[02:24:25.059 --> 02:24:26.179]  Go look at his quotes.
[02:24:26.179 --> 02:24:27.700]  They admit it's to destroy Europe.
[02:24:27.700 --> 02:24:27.980]  Go ahead.
[02:24:29.617 --> 02:24:36.720]  And then you guys, with Leo Zegami, which was a great interview, he talked about this Calergy Plan, and this is coming to fruition.
[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:46.764]  They're going to scare these Europeans to the point where they're going to take a biometric system because they're so scared of the Islamic terror, which I believe is almost Gladio Part 2.
[02:24:46.764 --> 02:24:50.245]  And I just wanted to throw that at you guys and see what you thought.
[02:24:50.245 --> 02:24:51.486]  That's a great point, Pastor Manning.
[02:24:52.455 --> 02:24:59.122]  Well, you know, there's several ways of looking at that, but I'd like to look at it through the eyes of a Trump presidency.
[02:24:59.122 --> 02:25:05.690]  I believe that a Trump presidency would wake up the cousins, wake up our cousins in Europe.
[02:25:05.690 --> 02:25:12.337]  And once we see how wonderfully it is working in America, Angela Merkel will catch the same vision in Germany.
[02:25:13.038 --> 02:25:15.660]  And the same thing in London.
[02:25:15.660 --> 02:25:27.814]  You mentioned earlier, Alex, that you were in London and you were taking pictures and moved for a cutaway, and some of the Muslims came over and began to yell at you, but you stood up.
[02:25:27.814 --> 02:25:33.861]  London has been, and many of the neighborhoods, and I think East London, taken over.
[02:25:34.381 --> 02:25:35.502]  By Islamic thought.
[02:25:35.502 --> 02:25:41.905]  But I believe that a Trump presidency using America as a paradigm, we're putting the brakes on Islam completely.
[02:25:41.905 --> 02:25:52.411]  You might find that the European nations may decide to follow the Trump principle of putting a brake on Muslims also and sending them back to the 22 nations, by the way.
[02:25:52.411 --> 02:25:54.453]  I mean, there are a lot of people without a country.
[02:25:54.453 --> 02:25:56.514]  Saudi Arabia hasn't taken one of them.
[02:25:57.506 --> 02:26:14.533]  Well, you know, you've got 22 nations over there at the Horn of Africa, from Pakistan all the way back over to Morocco, where they can find habitation and eat their own food and have their own, if you will, worship centers, and not bother us here in America and let us go on with our Christian ideas.
[02:26:14.533 --> 02:26:14.993]  That's right.
[02:26:14.993 --> 02:26:15.813]  Okay, one more call.
[02:26:15.813 --> 02:26:19.194]  We're going to let Pastor Manning go, come back from break, get to some clubs and take more calls.
[02:26:19.194 --> 02:26:21.035]  A lot of great calls here for him.
[02:26:21.035 --> 02:26:23.396]  But no, he's got his own program to do and other things.
[02:26:23.396 --> 02:26:25.017]  Steve in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:26:25.017 --> 02:26:25.597]  Thanks for holding.
[02:26:25.597 --> 02:26:25.877]  Go ahead.
[02:26:28.058 --> 02:26:41.846]  Yeah, my question is, you know, I really see the church now as the lukewarm church, and it's been cold or hot, and I think political correctness has really, you know, advocated that, and so we're just standing down and not saying anything.
[02:26:41.846 --> 02:26:54.393]  I was wondering if, Pastor Manning, you thought that Islam was going to become the world religion, that one world religion, so the people actually become a slave class to the government and children.
[02:26:55.478 --> 02:26:56.499]  No, I don't.
[02:26:56.499 --> 02:27:00.763]  I don't believe Islam does not have the spiritual power to do so.
[02:27:00.763 --> 02:27:05.328]  I think Christianity and the power of the word... Listen, the church has become lukewarm.
[02:27:05.328 --> 02:27:09.912]  In fact, I'm not sure I want to call many of these organizations churches anymore.
[02:27:09.912 --> 02:27:15.178]  I think they're organizations socially that has some pretext to the Bible.
[02:27:15.678 --> 02:27:27.028]  But I think the strength of salvation, preaching against sin, preaching the power of the blood of Jesus, and preaching the church as the womb and bride of Christ is what a church is.
[02:27:27.028 --> 02:27:32.093]  I don't see that happening, so if it doesn't walk like a duck, talk like a duck, then it ain't a duck.
[02:27:32.093 --> 02:27:36.576]  Sure, what they did with the World Council of Churches, it's all declassified with the Rockefellers last hundred years.
[02:27:36.576 --> 02:27:40.420]  They come in with the seminary control at the top of the church, usually threaten them or whatever.
[02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:41.761]  That's the problem.
[02:27:41.761 --> 02:27:42.362]  Exactly.
[02:27:42.362 --> 02:27:43.723]  I mean, please elaborate.
[02:27:43.723 --> 02:27:44.644]  Come back in the whole show.
[02:27:44.644 --> 02:27:46.345]  We'll do a minute on this here in just a second.
[02:27:46.345 --> 02:28:01.599]  They come in and they go, we've got to incrementally end Christianity, but we do it slowly, claiming we want to be more inclusive until the First Methodist Church of Austin, Texas basically is like the most hardcore MSNBC program you've ever seen.
[02:28:01.599 --> 02:28:04.082]  Pastor Manning, can you elaborate on what the World Council of Churches has done?
[02:28:04.980 --> 02:28:22.487]  Well, what has happened is that we've had disseminary trainers, you have stated, leaders, many of them coming out of what was from the end of World War II and the influx of a lot of German theologians who began, especially after Bonhoeffer, and I'm not against him.
[02:28:22.487 --> 02:28:24.848]  If he was against Hitler, there's no doubt about it.
[02:28:25.268 --> 02:28:37.574]  But most of these seminaries, Alex, where the training of these World Council leaders and those that get the big positions on World Council church leadership have been seminary trained.
[02:28:37.574 --> 02:28:44.338]  They've been seminary trained by very liberal German theologians whose ideas are incompatible with Christianity.
[02:28:44.898 --> 02:28:51.299]  And for instance, you take a person like James Cone at Union Theological Seminary.
[02:28:51.299 --> 02:28:56.281]  His black theology has nothing to do with Christ or with the blood of Jesus.
[02:28:56.281 --> 02:29:00.922]  And then he influenced a person like Jeremiah Wright, who later influenced Barack Obama.
[02:29:00.922 --> 02:29:06.763]  That's right, and the CIA and Ford Foundation, it's declassified, did it so people wouldn't have identities of Christ and freedom and family.
[02:29:07.663 --> 02:29:12.065]  The identity is being race-baited and controlled and upset, right?
[02:29:12.065 --> 02:29:20.189]  Yes, and so that's why you've got the World Council of Churches being as liberal as it is, and we're not even having lukewarm churches.
[02:29:20.189 --> 02:29:23.790]  We might be able to tolerate them.
[02:29:23.790 --> 02:29:28.552]  We have very few churches that are preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ biblically these days.
[02:29:28.552 --> 02:29:29.613]  Very, very few.
[02:29:29.773 --> 02:29:35.697]  Well, we know ATLA's doing it online and every Wednesday night and every Sunday and every day serving bills to the poor and others.
[02:29:35.697 --> 02:29:38.358]  ATLA, A-T-L-A-H dot O-R-G.
[02:29:38.358 --> 02:29:40.960]  Pastor James Hibbett Manning, we salute you, we love you.
[02:29:40.960 --> 02:29:41.580]  God bless you.
[02:29:41.580 --> 02:29:42.061]  Godspeed.
[02:29:42.061 --> 02:29:43.562]  We'll see you again soon, my friend.
[02:29:43.562 --> 02:29:44.682]  We love you, Alex.
[02:29:44.682 --> 02:29:45.603]  Keep doing the work.
[02:29:45.603 --> 02:29:47.224]  Keep on doing it.
[02:29:47.224 --> 02:29:48.144]  All this together, brother.
[02:29:48.144 --> 02:29:48.785]  We're going to be back.
[02:29:48.785 --> 02:29:50.066]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.066 --> 02:29:52.587]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.587 --> 02:29:55.269]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.440 --> 02:30:12.817]  The left-leaning women from the popular daytime TV show The View are finally starting to admit that they agree with Donald Trump on his foreign policy and views on ISIS.
[02:30:12.817 --> 02:30:15.060]  I thought Donald Trump sounded really reasonable today.
[02:30:15.060 --> 02:30:16.081]  My law enforcement
[02:30:16.141 --> 02:30:20.903]  Because we need to be forceful.
[02:30:20.903 --> 02:30:24.264]  We can't have these muted responses to terror.
[02:30:24.264 --> 02:30:26.265]  And let me also say this about Donald Trump.
[02:30:26.265 --> 02:30:28.786]  You know, we trash him often here.
[02:30:28.786 --> 02:30:32.207]  Bottom line is, in January, and you've been saying that.
[02:30:32.207 --> 02:30:33.007]  I've been saying that.
[02:30:33.007 --> 02:30:36.789]  In January of this year, he said Brussels was a hellhole.
[02:30:36.789 --> 02:30:39.870]  He said there is something going on, Maria, and it is not good.
[02:30:39.870 --> 02:30:41.070]  Talking about Belgium.
[02:30:41.070 --> 02:30:41.611]  He was right.
[02:30:41.611 --> 02:30:42.931]  So he's right on a couple of things.
[02:30:42.931 --> 02:30:45.512]  So his foreign policy isn't so outrageous.
[02:30:45.572 --> 02:30:48.215]  So is Donald Trump really the voice of reason?
[02:30:48.215 --> 02:30:50.739]  And which candidate makes you feel safer?
[02:30:50.739 --> 02:30:53.322]  Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?
[02:30:53.322 --> 02:30:57.868]  Let us know what you think in the comment section right now at InfoWars.com

[02:31:59.125 --> 02:32:09.648]  You're investing in your health and supporting the InfoWar when you visit InfoWarsLife.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine and all the great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:09.648 --> 02:32:15.570]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[02:32:15.570 --> 02:32:17.631]  Iodine is key, is paramount.
[02:32:17.751 --> 02:32:22.795]  And there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[02:32:22.795 --> 02:32:31.742]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[02:32:31.742 --> 02:32:35.665]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[02:32:35.665 --> 02:32:38.488]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[02:32:38.488 --> 02:32:42.551]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine,
[02:32:42.691 --> 02:32:43.471]  We're good to go.
[02:33:17.270 --> 02:33:24.296]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.296 --> 02:33:25.938]  Great song right here.
[02:33:25.938 --> 02:33:28.300]  Monday through Friday.
[02:33:44.819 --> 02:33:46.340]  11 a.m., 3 p.m.
[02:33:46.340 --> 02:33:51.682]  Central, Anthony Gucciardi, InfoWars, health and wellness expert.
[02:33:51.682 --> 02:34:00.205]  We'll be hosting in the fourth hour, but he's also really informative on news, politics, state of the world, you name it.
[02:34:00.205 --> 02:34:01.766]  And he will be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:34:01.766 --> 02:34:05.847]  I love this line, I'll give you television.
[02:34:16.468 --> 02:34:21.289]  I really shouldn't have music on that I like, because then I want to just listen to the whole song.
[02:34:21.289 --> 02:34:26.490]  You know, when I said I was sad that David Bowie was dead, people said, that guy's a big liberal weirdo.
[02:34:26.490 --> 02:34:32.192]  You know, why are you sad he's dead?
[02:34:32.192 --> 02:34:32.892]  I mean, I don't care.
[02:34:32.892 --> 02:34:33.712]  I like people's music.
[02:34:33.712 --> 02:34:34.472]  I like their art.
[02:34:34.472 --> 02:34:40.814]  And I'm sad when anybody dies, unless it's like Joe Stalin or Mao Zedong or Adolf Hitler.
[02:34:40.814 --> 02:34:40.954]  See?
[02:34:47.698 --> 02:34:50.459]  I want people to be free.
[02:34:50.459 --> 02:34:52.220]  I'm a real liberal.
[02:34:52.220 --> 02:34:55.962]  I keep trying to explain that to everybody.
[02:34:55.962 --> 02:35:02.285]  So if you're a mainline establishment conservative, and you want everybody to conform to a certain little box, that's not who I am.
[02:35:03.917 --> 02:35:06.318]  I want people to leave kids alone.
[02:35:06.318 --> 02:35:07.679]  I want low taxes.
[02:35:07.679 --> 02:35:09.199]  I want fair trade deals.
[02:35:09.199 --> 02:35:10.960]  I want national sovereignty.
[02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:12.941]  I want to honor the human species.
[02:35:12.941 --> 02:35:16.462]  That means men and women and children.
[02:35:16.462 --> 02:35:20.604]  It is the controlled left that wants to control language and dumb everybody down.
[02:35:20.604 --> 02:35:22.885]  And it's the controlled establishment right.
[02:35:24.482 --> 02:35:41.071]  That over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again goes out there and bosses everybody around and tries to bring in their own tyranny that is a monothelistic tyranny, not of Christ, because Christ isn't a tyranny.
[02:35:41.071 --> 02:35:45.654]  It's a choice and a relationship.
[02:35:45.654 --> 02:35:52.498]  But a monothelistic tyranny of the establishment and only one wing of the same oppression.
[02:35:53.424 --> 02:35:54.985]  And that's where I'm coming from on that.
[02:35:54.985 --> 02:36:02.108]  We have the right to write what we want, say what we want, do what we want, as long as it doesn't hurt anybody else.
[02:36:02.108 --> 02:36:05.550]  But then you have the right to tell somebody you think they're wrong.
[02:36:05.550 --> 02:36:10.993]  And then if I disagree with you, it doesn't mean I'm saying I hate you.
[02:36:10.993 --> 02:36:12.354]  It just means I have a different view.
[02:36:12.354 --> 02:36:16.636]  So many liberals who aren't liberal, they use that term, they look at me and they say,
[02:36:17.799 --> 02:36:19.441]  You attacked me back for my views.
[02:36:19.441 --> 02:36:21.463]  You're trying to suppress my views.
[02:36:21.463 --> 02:36:22.303]  No.
[02:36:22.303 --> 02:36:42.183]  When I respond back to you, and they have different radical Muslim groups online trying to get our YouTube channel shut down right now, filing all sorts of fake complaints, we're getting ready to do a big report on it, foreign government media outlets from Turkey and others that really want to get in a lawsuit, and others,
[02:36:45.390 --> 02:36:51.156]  And they think it's all about running everyone over and making everybody submit to their worldview.
[02:36:51.156 --> 02:36:55.140]  That dog isn't going to hunt here anymore.
[02:36:55.140 --> 02:36:56.702]  And you and all your buddies
[02:36:58.894 --> 02:37:11.460]  And you and all the establishment minions, and all the weird kleptocratic, oppressive, fake left people, fake renaissance people, that point at culture and society and claim they built all this.
[02:37:11.460 --> 02:37:15.402]  Obama just doesn't say you didn't build your business, and government did.
[02:37:15.402 --> 02:37:18.823]  They also act like they built culture, they built art.
[02:37:18.823 --> 02:37:23.926]  They're the reason there's all these beautiful and wonderful things, because they always associate themselves with them.
[02:37:25.424 --> 02:37:32.789]  The truth is, big government gives you Cuba, it gives you North Korea.
[02:37:32.789 --> 02:37:40.795]  And I want to go to your calls on the news, but I tell you, it really hit me the last three, four days when Obama was in Cuba for two days.
[02:37:40.795 --> 02:37:45.578]  Knowing what's in Cuba, talking to people that have been there and worked there, even leftists.
[02:37:45.578 --> 02:37:48.340]  I mean, most of the houses have caved in.
[02:37:48.340 --> 02:37:51.302]  There are no new cars that anybody built.
[02:37:51.302 --> 02:37:52.383]  Most of the cars are from the 40s and 50s.
[02:37:54.025 --> 02:37:56.906]  The public work is slaves.
[02:37:56.906 --> 02:38:02.949]  Farmers and fishermen and people might get to keep 10% of what they produce.
[02:38:02.949 --> 02:38:11.053]  There's all these little spoiled rotten children of the revolution, whose parents were the party officials, who are now the party officials.
[02:38:11.053 --> 02:38:14.675]  It's handed in a hereditary way down.
[02:38:14.675 --> 02:38:21.478]  And the people look at America, the flower of the Renaissance, and go, it's about being white, it's about being entitled.
[02:38:21.478 --> 02:38:22.339]  Undoubtedly!
[02:38:23.570 --> 02:38:33.539]  If you were from the right family, in the right town, in the right universities, in the right sororities, in the right fraternities, and had the right looks, you would be given positions of power.
[02:38:33.539 --> 02:38:36.822]  But America was about getting away from that.
[02:38:36.822 --> 02:38:38.183]  Away from the crown.
[02:38:38.183 --> 02:38:39.784]  Away from lords.
[02:38:39.784 --> 02:38:44.248]  Away from foreign governors.
[02:38:44.248 --> 02:38:49.313]  George Washington's biggest reason for wanting to be in the war was that he was one of the best soldiers
[02:38:50.697 --> 02:38:50.797]  Yeah.
[02:39:12.267 --> 02:39:15.710]  with some of them to try to get a better contractor, a better job.
[02:39:15.710 --> 02:39:20.854]  He had to arrive in the perfect green or black carriage that he had to buy from London.
[02:39:20.854 --> 02:39:23.336]  You weren't allowed to produce it in the U.S.
[02:39:23.336 --> 02:39:24.337]  That was law.
[02:39:24.337 --> 02:39:30.142]  He had to have the perfect clothes made in London or France, not allowed to be made in the colonies.
[02:39:30.142 --> 02:39:32.043]  He couldn't go buy property himself.
[02:39:32.043 --> 02:39:34.766]  He had to go to a lord and do it under him.
[02:39:34.766 --> 02:39:39.650]  He was basically a high-powered slave.
[02:39:39.650 --> 02:39:41.131]  He could not do what they could do.
[02:39:42.941 --> 02:39:47.046]  And so he envisioned his slaves not being slaves and wrote about it.
[02:39:47.046 --> 02:39:51.532]  He envisioned himself not being a second-class citizen to the British.
[02:39:51.532 --> 02:39:57.860]  And he was sick of the arrogant British officers shooting their mouths off and acting tough in front of a lot better men.
[02:39:59.744 --> 02:40:12.368]  And so he led an army in a six-year war, three-to-one, five-to-one, ten-to-one at some times, including giant Hessian armies of German slave soldiers who had so much free decor, they didn't even know they were slaves.
[02:40:12.368 --> 02:40:13.709]  They knew they were slaves.
[02:40:13.709 --> 02:40:20.451]  They were proud of the slave collars they wore around their neck because they were ceremonial.
[02:40:20.451 --> 02:40:26.873]  They were such proud slaves that they didn't even need to be chained up at night.
[02:40:29.309 --> 02:40:29.950]  But you know what happened?
[02:40:29.950 --> 02:40:38.499]  They never had German, really Prussian, and other defectors in other major campaigns around Europe.
[02:40:38.499 --> 02:40:46.527]  But they had major desertions in the colonies because there were so many German immigrants here.
[02:40:46.527 --> 02:40:50.812]  They were probably the second biggest ethnic group at that time, even above Irish or Scottish.
[02:40:53.049 --> 02:40:56.433]  Depending on the area, New York would be the Dutch, we're the second most prominent group.
[02:40:56.433 --> 02:41:00.397]  And they speak to them in German and say, you're crazy, you're a slave, you're an idiot.
[02:41:00.397 --> 02:41:02.659]  You're totally controlled in that fancy uniform.
[02:41:02.659 --> 02:41:05.182]  Throw that off right now.
[02:41:05.182 --> 02:41:07.424]  I got daughters, you know, that need a good man.
[02:41:07.424 --> 02:41:09.366]  Come join our community right here.
[02:41:09.366 --> 02:41:14.151]  And by the way, once they joined, it's in the history books, within a few weeks, they usually took up arms.
[02:41:18.283 --> 02:41:21.086]  America is where so much of the freedom started.
[02:41:21.086 --> 02:41:25.630]  Then they pointed our problems because the public's ignorant and don't know much of it started here.
[02:41:25.630 --> 02:41:28.633]  Most of it started here and in England in 1215.
[02:41:28.633 --> 02:41:30.815]  I'm gonna go to your calls in the news.
[02:41:30.815 --> 02:41:41.946]  It's just so frustrating to see the public completely ignorant about the history of this country or where it really came from or what went on.
[02:41:41.946 --> 02:41:42.487]  Imagine
[02:41:47.025 --> 02:41:59.531]  That George Washington couldn't go on a boat to England, which he never did when he was a young man, but he could have, to get a pair of boots because then there was an import tax bill to bring it back into the colony.
[02:42:00.509 --> 02:42:08.318]  So if he tried to buy the pair of boots that he had to have to be accepted at one of the clubs to do business.
[02:42:08.318 --> 02:42:09.219]  Talk about discriminatory.
[02:42:09.219 --> 02:42:17.990]  99 point whatever percent and it was more than 99 percent of white people could not get in those dinner clubs with the English gentleman.
[02:42:18.928 --> 02:42:29.211]  If you didn't have an English last name, you could hardly get into it unless you had German letters behind your name from a university or French letters.
[02:42:29.211 --> 02:42:43.156]  If you were a doctor or a doctor of philosophy, then, and you had the proper dress, then you could get into one of those private club meetings.
[02:42:43.156 --> 02:42:45.397]  You're sitting around talking about white privilege, folks.
[02:42:45.397 --> 02:42:45.857]  Give me a break.
[02:42:46.954 --> 02:42:49.937]  Maybe 2% of the South owned slaves.
[02:42:49.937 --> 02:42:57.944]  The real racism came when it ended, because then the whites had to compete, in some cases, with half the population being black.
[02:42:57.944 --> 02:43:06.831]  And the whites were already almost starving to death, or starving to death as sharecroppers, no fault of the black slaves, and now they were starving to death!
[02:43:06.831 --> 02:43:14.578]  Because half the population was black in many areas of the South, and they didn't have any place to live, or any jobs anymore.
[02:43:16.667 --> 02:43:28.296]  See, these are the real histories no one's taught, because they want to keep us all at each other's throats, and they use total ignorance to sell the entire thing, and I'm sick of it.
[02:43:28.296 --> 02:43:39.904]  You ought to read George Washington's letters, where he would just groan, having to spend almost all his money to try to get the right carriage, or the right boots, and how foppish it was, how dandy it was, which means, you know, like, effeminate.
[02:43:40.879 --> 02:43:46.363]  This is like a soldier, tough guy, you know, six months out in the brush, you know, fighting.
[02:43:46.363 --> 02:43:49.886]  Comes back, he's squared off all this land.
[02:43:49.886 --> 02:43:58.033]  He wants to be able to get a piece of it for himself, but because he's not part of the crown, he can't even get property for himself.
[02:43:58.033 --> 02:44:03.597]  He has to go and sell the land that he's just almost died for, fighting the French for, to
[02:44:07.782 --> 02:44:10.123]  Someone above him who then just basically steals it.
[02:44:10.123 --> 02:44:11.123]  Oh, thank you for all this.
[02:44:11.123 --> 02:44:13.925]  Here, I get a hundred gold coins, you get one.
[02:44:13.925 --> 02:44:15.805]  That's why George Washington did what he did.
[02:44:15.805 --> 02:44:17.086]  Because he was being discriminated against.
[02:44:17.086 --> 02:44:19.907]  You go, oh, I bet he was stealing land from some native group.
[02:44:19.907 --> 02:44:22.728]  Let me tell you, natives were just as bad as the French for anybody else.
[02:44:22.728 --> 02:44:26.350]  I'm not saying worse, just as bad.
[02:44:26.350 --> 02:44:27.090]  Go see The Revenant.
[02:44:27.090 --> 02:44:28.971]  That's a very accurate movie.
[02:44:28.971 --> 02:44:31.372]  As far as it goes with the natives.
[02:44:31.372 --> 02:44:33.593]  One tribe might be honorable and sweet as pie.
[02:44:35.814 --> 02:44:39.556]  Next tribe, totally psychotic, whacked out on hallucinogens constantly.
[02:44:39.556 --> 02:44:41.697]  Running around murdering everybody.
[02:44:41.697 --> 02:44:49.901]  And they would come to your little hut or wherever and say, you're gonna give me guns and powder and you're gonna go help me kill these neighbors that I don't like or I'm gonna kill you.
[02:44:49.901 --> 02:44:53.422]  So you'd go join them in the expansion.
[02:44:53.422 --> 02:44:56.444]  The natives got screwed over because they didn't stick together.
[02:44:56.444 --> 02:44:57.965]  You talk about racist?
[02:44:57.965 --> 02:45:02.507]  They were the most tribal, modern term, racist people you could imagine, Native Americans.
[02:45:03.393 --> 02:45:08.240]  And by the way, interesting people, amazing in many respects, neat culture.
[02:45:08.240 --> 02:45:10.343]  I am proud of my Native American roots.
[02:45:10.343 --> 02:45:12.486]  On my dad's side, just you name it.
[02:45:12.486 --> 02:45:14.790]  Three different backgrounds.
[02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:15.931]  Three different.
[02:45:15.931 --> 02:45:19.657]  Seminole, Comanche, and Cherokee.
[02:45:21.055 --> 02:45:23.556]  And of course, Seminole, for those who don't know, is part of one of the big Trail of Tears.
[02:45:23.556 --> 02:45:24.977]  They're really out of Oklahoma, too.
[02:45:24.977 --> 02:45:28.638]  Sent down, and North Texas sent into Florida.
[02:45:28.638 --> 02:45:30.559]  Those Seminole Indians, most of them are really out of Oklahoma.
[02:45:30.559 --> 02:45:33.480]  They just call them Seminoles, because the locals call them because they're in the Seminoles.
[02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:35.401]  Swamp.
[02:45:35.401 --> 02:45:40.123]  I mean, my dad didn't go to reservations where they sit there with tourists watching them.
[02:45:40.123 --> 02:45:42.724]  My dad, when he was a kid, went to the real reservations.
[02:45:42.724 --> 02:45:44.065]  You know, people dancing for two days.
[02:45:45.868 --> 02:45:50.931]  And his grandpa and grandma would go back into town and were like, you know, some of the leaders of the town and everybody else.
[02:45:50.931 --> 02:45:53.533]  But let me tell you, they went pretty wild.
[02:45:53.533 --> 02:45:55.695]  Dance around two days around a fire, you get wild too.
[02:45:55.695 --> 02:45:56.935]  Wonder what they were doing.
[02:45:56.935 --> 02:46:03.340]  See, I don't just sit up here with all this fake liberal garbage around me and go, oh, the natives, oh, they're so perfect.
[02:46:03.340 --> 02:46:04.400]  Oh, they're so good.
[02:46:04.400 --> 02:46:12.746]  Oh, they're so... A load of baloney.
[02:46:12.746 --> 02:46:13.787]  Absolute bull.
[02:46:15.134 --> 02:46:20.759]  I remember when I was a kid, my dad told me about Quanah Parker and all sorts of family stories and stuff.
[02:46:20.759 --> 02:46:23.181]  You go on these trendy bars, they got Quanah Parker all over the place.
[02:46:23.181 --> 02:46:27.544]  If I told the stories my grandma told me, my dad's grandmother, she died when she was 103, had the name Moon.
[02:46:27.544 --> 02:46:29.846]  That's how Indian she was.
[02:46:29.846 --> 02:46:31.728]  These trendies would fall down on the ground and start worshipping.
[02:46:32.128 --> 02:46:35.791]  I mean, these people have no idea what's all around them, the history in the other.
[02:46:35.791 --> 02:46:37.712]  They just know they hate America.
[02:46:37.712 --> 02:46:38.773]  They hate free market.
[02:46:38.773 --> 02:46:39.693]  They hate wealth.
[02:46:39.693 --> 02:46:40.674]  They hate power.
[02:46:40.674 --> 02:46:41.674]  They hate success.
[02:46:41.674 --> 02:46:48.819]  They hate all the choices that they got from this Renaissance culture.
[02:46:48.819 --> 02:47:00.247]  That's now captured and has now been taken control of by globalists that hate us as we go out doing all their dirty work to bring in the planetary world government.
[02:47:07.500 --> 02:47:08.922]  They got it all figured out.
[02:47:08.922 --> 02:47:11.144]  And Manning said it perfectly.
[02:47:11.144 --> 02:47:13.867]  I went too far defending the Muslims before and got criticized for it.
[02:47:13.867 --> 02:47:16.490]  And I admit it back when I used to just totally defend it and try to stop it.
[02:47:16.490 --> 02:47:18.712]  Because I didn't want the collapse of civilizations to happen.
[02:47:18.712 --> 02:47:21.055]  The collapse of civilizations is here.
[02:47:21.055 --> 02:47:26.521]  And now I'm not dealing with Muslims that want to go to the university and be doctors and want to be successful and are smart people.
[02:47:28.777 --> 02:47:38.062]  I'm dealing with the Wahhabist and the people that invaded Syria and murdered all those folks, now coming here looking at me like they want to kill me.
[02:47:38.062 --> 02:47:51.569]  They feel inadequate, they don't feel wealthy, they're in the middle of all this, like a stranger in a strange land, like a Martian come to Earth, and they are angry, and the left is there to fill them full of hatred of America and everybody else, and they are taking the bait.
[02:47:53.888 --> 02:48:07.940]  So my real discussions with the fake feminists, the foundations, the liberals, who hate this country and freedom and Christians so much, they love radical Muslims.
[02:48:07.940 --> 02:48:11.162]  But I tell you, there is nobody more oppressive, more weird, more
[02:48:14.341 --> 02:48:23.889]  Retentive, and cloistered, and fidgeting, and weird, and perverted, and pervy, seedy, creepy than the Wahhabist.
[02:48:23.889 --> 02:48:27.072]  I mean, they make my skin crawl.
[02:48:27.072 --> 02:48:33.998]  It's like when you see a pedophile on TV that's been caught with little kids or something, and they look real sick, and pot-bellied, and demonic.
[02:48:33.998 --> 02:48:36.500]  They have little skinny arms.
[02:48:36.500 --> 02:48:37.161]  They always look the same.
[02:48:37.161 --> 02:48:40.243]  I don't care if they're black, white, whatever.
[02:48:40.243 --> 02:48:40.824]  They look the same.
[02:48:42.534 --> 02:48:45.496]  There's something about him, and your skin crawls.
[02:48:45.496 --> 02:48:51.679]  When I look at the Royal Saudis, and I look at all those people, and I look at the Al-Qaeda and ISIS, my skin crawls.
[02:48:51.679 --> 02:48:57.102]  It's like this ISIS guy on TV bragging how, you know, he wants Islam to take over and how great it is.
[02:48:57.102 --> 02:48:59.063]  He has this sick, demonic look in his eye.
[02:48:59.063 --> 02:49:00.184]  He looks really weak.
[02:49:00.184 --> 02:49:01.825]  He's got that beard I want to pull out.
[02:49:03.274 --> 02:49:09.479]  And I wanna just climb in a ring with him and say, you're a real man, here's a hatchet, I got one now, let's just see what happens, punk.
[02:49:09.479 --> 02:49:18.887]  And it's not that I'm even a tough guy looking for trouble, and I'm saying figuratively here, at an instinctive level, I wanna ram my head into his and say, you wanna bang heads with me?
[02:49:18.887 --> 02:49:20.509]  Let's just see who'll ram heads harder, okay?
[02:49:21.129 --> 02:49:22.270]  Let's just find out right now.
[02:49:22.270 --> 02:49:29.317]  You want to praise all this crap going on and people getting blown up at an American Airlines ticket counter in a cowardly way?
[02:49:29.317 --> 02:49:39.927]  I'm sick of how they think it's trending and cool and how you wear these diaper outfits all over the place around our culture with our spacecraft and our reactors and all of our good stuff that God gave us!
[02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:43.841]  You like to push women around?
[02:49:43.841 --> 02:49:49.104]  While the feminists parade around all day and lecture the West that holds women up to the highest level?
[02:49:49.104 --> 02:49:54.206]  And then these spoiled rotten women of the West look at men of the West and tell us we've got a problem?
[02:49:54.206 --> 02:49:57.568]  We did something to women!
[02:49:57.568 --> 02:49:58.669]  That is ridiculous!
[02:49:58.669 --> 02:50:02.971]  Okay, I'm going to go to break, take calls for a few seconds.
[02:50:02.971 --> 02:50:03.611]  Nancy's taking over.
[02:50:03.611 --> 02:50:04.252]  I'm starting to get mad.
[02:50:04.252 --> 02:50:05.492]  I can't do it because I'm going to get too exhausted.
[02:50:05.492 --> 02:50:07.353]  I've got a lot of stuff coming up.
[02:50:07.353 --> 02:50:09.775]  I'm going to tape part of an original show for the
[02:50:12.122 --> 02:50:15.131]  Easter event that's coming up this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:50:15.131 --> 02:50:17.960]  I'm going to take some of that today and tomorrow and some of it will be best of.
[02:50:17.960 --> 02:50:18.943]  That'll be 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:50:18.943 --> 02:50:19.204]  Sunday.
[02:50:21.265 --> 02:50:25.407]  We need funding, obviously.
[02:50:25.407 --> 02:50:27.228]  We don't want to just stay the same size or implode.
[02:50:27.228 --> 02:50:29.329]  You either get bigger or you get smaller.
[02:50:29.329 --> 02:50:30.330]  Big fish eat little fish.

[02:51:38.438 --> 02:51:42.381]  Traditional control agents contain toxic chemicals which do more harm than good.
[02:51:42.381 --> 02:51:44.682]  Sanitize and disinfect using just water.
[02:51:44.682 --> 02:51:46.363]  Quick, fast, and surprisingly easy.

[02:51:59.693 --> 02:52:04.059]  Biochemistry determines your mood, memory, energy, and endurance.
[02:52:04.059 --> 02:52:07.063]  Your body's primary metabolic function is to make protein.
[02:52:07.063 --> 02:52:10.007]  One World Whey is a unique, non-denatured protein.
[02:52:10.007 --> 02:52:15.255]  This enables your body to have virtually 100% utilization, whereas typical whey protein powders offer
[02:52:15.475 --> 02:52:18.377]  No more than 18% utilization of protein.
[02:52:18.377 --> 02:52:21.498]  One World Way also delivers life-giving frequencies to your cells.
[02:52:21.498 --> 02:52:27.042]  The net result for so many people is improved energy, mood, and elimination of pain from inflammation.
[02:52:27.042 --> 02:52:30.924]  This technologically enhanced One World Way has been really amazing.
[02:52:31.504 --> 02:52:38.109]  I'm 36 years old, and for the past several years, I've been struggling with lack of energy, drive, and stamina.
[02:52:38.109 --> 02:52:41.952]  And after just two weeks on this product, I'm feeling so much more energy.
[02:52:41.952 --> 02:52:48.217]  My yoga practice has deepened, and as a massage therapist, I'm able to see more clients than I've been able to in years.
[02:52:48.217 --> 02:52:51.359]  I've never felt results that quick with anything I've ever taken.

[02:53:02.324 --> 02:53:09.730]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a SelectQuote agent with a true story of how SelectQuote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[02:53:09.730 --> 02:53:13.333]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[02:53:13.333 --> 02:53:17.037]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[02:53:17.697 --> 02:53:19.498]  I said, let me see.
[02:53:19.498 --> 02:53:30.582]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[02:53:30.582 --> 02:53:41.707]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[02:53:42.662 --> 02:53:43.663]  How about you?
[02:53:43.663 --> 02:53:44.984]  For your free quote, call 1-800-654-1632.
[02:53:44.984 --> 02:53:45.304]  That's 1-800-654-1632.
[02:53:45.304 --> 02:53:45.404]  1-800-654-1632.
[02:53:45.404 --> 02:53:46.425]  Or go to selectquote.com.
[02:53:46.425 --> 02:53:46.806]  We shop.
[02:53:46.806 --> 02:53:47.206]  You save.
[02:53:47.206 --> 02:53:55.333]  I don't know if folks were holding for Pastor Manning, but obviously after an hour and a half, he had to make the jump into hyperspace.
[02:53:55.333 --> 02:53:56.474]  I could have kept him longer.
[02:54:10.106 --> 02:54:15.269]  He's got his own ministry to run and thinks he's a busy guy.
[02:54:15.269 --> 02:54:18.410]  You see, Patrick Manning and I may have different color skin, but that's really about it.
[02:54:18.410 --> 02:54:20.011]  He wants freedom.
[02:54:20.011 --> 02:54:21.031]  He doesn't like tyranny.
[02:54:21.031 --> 02:54:23.993]  He wants to see us empowered and wealthy and successful.
[02:54:23.993 --> 02:54:26.254]  He wants us to have religious freedom.
[02:54:26.254 --> 02:54:30.876]  That's truly classical liberalism that Thomas Jefferson pushed.
[02:54:30.876 --> 02:54:32.137]  Not what we're facing today.
[02:54:32.137 --> 02:54:34.978]  And Rudolph Giuliani's come out and told the truth.
[02:54:34.978 --> 02:54:37.780]  Hillary Clinton could be considered a founding member of ISIS.
[02:54:38.817 --> 02:54:48.742]  And the fact that we first exposed ISIS and Al Qaeda to be Western-run, and then countless others came out and exposed it, now means people like him can expose Hillary for that, and so can Trump.
[02:54:48.742 --> 02:54:51.543]  And that's the type of job you as listeners are doing.
[02:54:51.543 --> 02:54:52.783]  That's why you're the tip of the spear.
[02:54:52.783 --> 02:54:55.165]  You're the most important.
[02:54:55.165 --> 02:55:02.568]  We're the most important, because we're willing to say it when nobody else will up front, because it's the truth to make it safe for others to say it.
[02:55:02.568 --> 02:55:04.189]  Take Trump.
[02:55:04.189 --> 02:55:06.710]  A month after the interview went viral, he tweeted it today.
[02:55:07.975 --> 02:55:12.318]  Interview breaks down how Koch brothers are controlling the Republican establishment.
[02:55:12.318 --> 02:55:16.620]  And Trump tweeted out about that a month later, and it's all over the news.
[02:55:16.620 --> 02:55:20.602]  And the media is criticizing Trump for sending out an InfoWars tweet.
[02:55:20.602 --> 02:55:21.583]  You see, that's how that works.
[02:55:23.183 --> 02:55:26.665]  Well, get this media, we don't need Trump to send our stuff out for it to get out.
[02:55:26.665 --> 02:55:28.065]  You understand how that works?
[02:55:28.065 --> 02:55:29.286]  Let's go to some calls in this segment.
[02:55:29.286 --> 02:55:34.809]  The next, Tom, I apologize, Tom, I didn't see you were calling from London or I would have gone to you sooner.
[02:55:34.809 --> 02:55:39.291]  You're on the air from, I guess, old Britannic Majesty's headquarters.
[02:55:39.291 --> 02:55:41.372]  Go ahead.
[02:55:41.372 --> 02:55:42.132]  Yes, hello.
[02:55:42.132 --> 02:55:43.593]  Thank you, Lord Alex.
[02:55:43.593 --> 02:55:47.295]  Good to talk to you again.
[02:55:47.295 --> 02:55:52.337]  Yes, so, radical Islam being the dominant group of Islam.
[02:55:53.277 --> 02:55:55.564]  Now that, I've heard you say that a few times.
[02:55:56.713 --> 02:55:58.695]  And it's completely false.
[02:55:58.695 --> 02:56:01.517]  I mean, they're the tiniest group of Islam.
[02:56:01.517 --> 02:56:10.644]  Well, I think the ones actually blowing stuff up and killing people are, but from a lot of experts I've seen, isn't the Wahhabist form dominating more and more Sunni Islam?
[02:56:10.644 --> 02:56:13.306]  And Sunni Islam, 79% of Muslims.
[02:56:13.306 --> 02:56:22.974]  I mean, isn't there a new expansionist faction of Islam that, when I say the dominant, aren't they the ones beginning to start to lead Islam?
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:35.262]  Well, they're trying to, but they, you know, they're like a tiny percentage of a tiny percentage of a tiny percentage.
[02:56:35.262 --> 02:56:49.025]  I mean, Islamic cultures, Islamic communities are actually very resistant to that sort of radicalization because they're based around family structures.
[02:56:49.025 --> 02:56:54.846]  So, you know, a Muslim person would listen to their parents, their grandparents,
[02:56:56.184 --> 02:56:59.145]  Maybe they're local elders, and then it would be the Imam.
[02:56:59.145 --> 02:57:00.945]  So that's why you can't bring in... Well, no, I agree.
[02:57:00.945 --> 02:57:06.887]  That's one reason ISIS and al-Qaeda recruit a bunch of Western idiots who haven't ever been Muslims, is because they're easier to recruit.
[02:57:06.887 --> 02:57:11.388]  What you're saying's true, but, sir, Saudi Arabia is funding radical Islam.
[02:57:11.388 --> 02:57:14.489]  It controls the dominant Sunni system.
[02:57:14.489 --> 02:57:16.769]  You know, it's Sunni than Shiite.
[02:57:16.769 --> 02:57:19.190]  Shiite's about 19%, Alawite and other groups about 2%.
[02:57:20.290 --> 02:57:22.792]  Iran is Shia, Syria is Shia, most of North Africa is Shia.
[02:57:36.710 --> 02:57:43.372]  You're right in saying that the Saudis control the very radical element of Sunnis.
[02:57:43.372 --> 02:57:45.333]  Yes, listen, hey, I've studied history.
[02:57:45.333 --> 02:57:49.815]  For 200 years, Islam was a light in the world and the West was in barbarism.
[02:57:49.815 --> 02:57:53.436]  So Islam in periods has been a renaissance.
[02:57:53.436 --> 02:57:56.997]  But I mean, currently what I say, with Saudi Arabia running it, I don't think so.
[02:57:56.997 --> 02:57:58.878]  But I'm not saying all Muslims.
[02:57:58.878 --> 02:58:01.439]  I don't hate Muslims because they're Muslims.
[02:58:01.439 --> 02:58:02.740]  I used to be a big apologist.
[02:58:02.740 --> 02:58:06.301]  I just am sick and tired of seeing this alliance with the left and the Wahhabists.
[02:58:08.154 --> 02:58:10.094]  Guess who does hate Muslims?
[02:58:10.094 --> 02:58:11.795]  The New World Order hates Muslims.
[02:58:11.795 --> 02:58:12.935]  And you used to know this.
[02:58:12.935 --> 02:58:15.336]  You used to say this on your show.
[02:58:15.336 --> 02:58:19.657]  They are a highly resistant group.
[02:58:19.657 --> 02:58:28.579]  Yes, and so they're using the Wahhabis to run around and murder all the Muslims that aren't going along with it in Egypt and in Libya and in Syria and countless areas.
[02:58:28.579 --> 02:58:29.879]  And I said that with Manning earlier.
[02:58:30.259 --> 02:58:35.662]  That they're going to use radicalism as a way to play us off against each other in a clash of civilizations and kill everybody.
[02:58:35.662 --> 02:58:44.826]  That said, though, all these radical Wahhabis merging with hip-hop gangster culture are my enemies and then Muslims need to stand up against them and say no.
[02:58:44.826 --> 02:58:46.647]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:58:46.647 --> 02:58:47.188]  I appreciate you.
[02:58:47.188 --> 02:58:47.848]  God bless you, Tom.
[02:58:49.386 --> 02:58:50.046]  Uh, yeah.
[02:58:50.046 --> 02:58:55.870]  First of all, I want to say Bigfoot 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[02:58:55.870 --> 02:58:56.830]  I use them all.
[02:58:56.830 --> 02:58:57.811]  They're phenomenal.
[02:58:57.811 --> 02:58:58.551]  They work.
[02:58:58.551 --> 02:58:59.391]  Buy them, folks.
[02:58:59.391 --> 02:58:59.772]  Thank you, brother.
[02:58:59.772 --> 02:59:01.793]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[02:59:01.793 --> 02:59:08.636]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[02:59:08.636 --> 02:59:09.997]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[02:59:09.997 --> 02:59:15.420]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.

[02:59:20.343 --> 02:59:21.264]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:59:21.264 --> 02:59:22.304]  Have they worked for you?
[02:59:22.304 --> 02:59:25.166]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.

[02:59:45.284 --> 02:59:47.427]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:07.951 --> 03:00:13.274]  Another time in the age of wonder.
[03:00:13.274 --> 03:00:15.695]  I'm like a little kid, folks.
[03:00:15.695 --> 03:00:16.716]  I play songs and
[03:00:18.237 --> 03:00:22.139]  Clips, and I voice over with it.
[03:00:22.139 --> 03:00:25.200]  That's how Dreams works, though.
[03:00:25.200 --> 03:00:27.841]  Until the crystal cracks.
[03:00:27.841 --> 03:00:34.945]  When I was a little kid, I wanted to be in voiceovers.
[03:00:34.945 --> 03:00:44.549]  And then... By the time I'd been on radio about five, six years, I was cutting commercials for national movie releases.
[03:00:45.735 --> 03:00:50.057]  And for insurance companies and you name it.
[03:00:50.057 --> 03:00:50.757]  And it's crazy.
[03:00:50.757 --> 03:00:51.357]  I'm not bragging.
[03:00:51.357 --> 03:00:54.878]  It just shows the power of dreams.
[03:00:54.878 --> 03:01:03.821]  I could make more money and just be by myself, maybe with an agent, more money personally doing national voiceovers than I could as this major radio host.
[03:01:03.821 --> 03:01:10.344]  Because I take a huge amount of money that comes in and put almost all of it back into the operation.
[03:01:10.344 --> 03:01:11.184]  So we reach more people.
[03:01:12.419 --> 03:01:13.019]  But you know what?
[03:01:13.019 --> 03:01:16.581]  There is no desire to even do voiceovers.
[03:01:16.581 --> 03:01:18.082]  Because I could fly to New York and D.C.
[03:01:18.082 --> 03:01:20.163]  and L.A., but it's mainly L.A.
[03:01:20.163 --> 03:01:21.843]  and New York.
[03:01:21.843 --> 03:01:37.110]  But all these big jobs, they want you to audition, and you're there with like all these other actors and people, maybe 10, 15 of them, and you go in for like 20, 30 minutes, then you go eat lunch, then they usually call you back, then it's 2 or 3, down to 2 or 3, the director's listening of the movie, the TV show, the ad, then they say, okay, you got the job.
[03:01:37.110 --> 03:01:39.211]  The times I did that, I always got the job.
[03:01:42.051 --> 03:01:45.953]  Until they wanted me to do the voiceover for Jesse Ventura's TV show.
[03:01:45.953 --> 03:01:50.955]  And I was busy, I didn't want to do it, and I didn't do a very good job, and I didn't get that one.
[03:01:50.955 --> 03:01:51.975]  And that was union scale.
[03:01:51.975 --> 03:01:53.035]  I'd have made a bunch of money doing that.
[03:01:53.035 --> 03:01:55.376]  I don't know why I'm telling a story about this.
[03:01:55.376 --> 03:01:56.617]  It just shows the power of dreams.
[03:01:57.998 --> 03:02:16.860]  And the power of having an idea, liking to make fun of cartoon characters like Marvin the Martian, and then actually getting into RTF because of that, but being politically aware, being mad at the globalists, so deciding to just on the side fight the New World Order, because that's what I really wanted to do for no pay, and then that actually became my career.
[03:02:16.860 --> 03:02:18.642]  But I'm just pointing out what motivates me.
[03:02:19.650 --> 03:02:21.331]  Not, oh my gosh, I just made all this money.
[03:02:21.331 --> 03:02:28.355]  It's like, oh my gosh, I've got to make a bunch of money to pay all this crew and these reporters and researchers so we can give the globalists a run for their money.
[03:02:28.355 --> 03:02:34.379]  So I can fly guest in to be in studios so we can have investigative journalists all over the world doing really important work.
[03:02:34.379 --> 03:02:37.441]  It's amazing and I want to thank you all for your support and help.
[03:02:37.441 --> 03:02:40.063]  It's been incredible.
[03:02:40.063 --> 03:02:43.545]  And your dreams can come true as well if it's done for the right reason.
[03:02:44.924 --> 03:02:48.507]  So many people I know get into fighting the New World Order for six months a year.
[03:02:48.507 --> 03:02:49.568]  They even have talent.
[03:02:49.568 --> 03:02:55.974]  Other talk show hosts, people that were secular, not in politics, like Glenn Beck was a big liberal.
[03:02:55.974 --> 03:02:57.636]  And he said, oh, I can do the Alex Jones shtick.
[03:02:57.636 --> 03:02:58.396]  Well, it's not a shtick.
[03:02:58.396 --> 03:03:01.539]  It's not about controlling the movement.
[03:03:01.539 --> 03:03:02.620]  It's about defeating the globalists.
[03:03:07.150 --> 03:03:08.690]  I'm just digressing, I don't even know why.
[03:03:08.690 --> 03:03:14.452]  I'm teleprompter free, so I start thinking about something and remembering something and then it just takes me down a rabbit trail.
[03:03:14.452 --> 03:03:29.275]  But, um, so many people I've seen have gotten involved in media and politics because it's like somebody wasn't successful in acting, they want to be a weatherman or a weatherwoman or they want to be on the local news because they're a narcissist.
[03:03:29.275 --> 03:03:30.275]  With me, it's the opposite.
[03:03:30.275 --> 03:03:34.036]  I could never be on TV, radio again and love it.
[03:03:34.036 --> 03:03:35.837]  Because I don't like being a public person.
[03:03:35.837 --> 03:03:36.457]  I don't do this.
[03:03:38.530 --> 03:03:40.411]  Because I want to be somebody.
[03:03:40.411 --> 03:03:41.993]  I do this because I take it personal.
[03:03:41.993 --> 03:03:43.294]  They're coming for my kids.
[03:03:43.294 --> 03:03:44.795]  They say my kids belong to the state.
[03:03:44.795 --> 03:03:46.036]  They want my guns.
[03:03:46.036 --> 03:03:48.357]  They want to overrun me with political correctness.
[03:03:48.357 --> 03:03:52.100]  They've got cults running at the schools saying the family is evil.
[03:03:52.100 --> 03:03:54.322]  This is ridiculous!
[03:03:54.322 --> 03:04:03.509]  And so many people I've seen in the Liberty Movement, not the grassroots, but others, they get involved and in a year, they want to be the biggest swing in you-know-what.
[03:04:03.509 --> 03:04:05.050]  They want to be the big shot.
[03:04:05.050 --> 03:04:07.572]  So they start attacking other people in the movement and the rest of it.
[03:04:08.533 --> 03:04:13.401]  To make themselves the kingpin and then claim that I've attacked them and it's so sad.
[03:04:13.401 --> 03:04:16.787]  But those aren't people that are meant to be leaders in this fight.
[03:04:16.787 --> 03:04:18.429]  You that have a pure heart.
[03:04:18.429 --> 03:04:20.132]  You that really want to fight tyranny.
[03:04:20.132 --> 03:04:22.776]  You've got to start a radio show or a TV show or a magazine or...
[03:04:24.062 --> 03:04:27.443]  A YouTube channel, or make a film, or write a book, or whatever.
[03:04:27.443 --> 03:04:28.704]  Write a letter to the editor.
[03:04:28.704 --> 03:04:30.605]  Just take that first step.
[03:04:30.605 --> 03:04:32.325]  Because you know you're in it for the right reasons.
[03:04:32.325 --> 03:04:35.847]  And when you get attacked by trolls and stuff, ignore the infighting.
[03:04:35.847 --> 03:04:39.288]  They attempt that just to divert you off into distractions and move forward.
[03:04:39.288 --> 03:04:40.529]  And that's how we're going to change the world.
[03:04:41.329 --> 03:04:48.013]  Speaking of funding the operation, we got a big special that ends in just a few days on the Deep Cleanse, Shilajit, Zeolite, you name it.
[03:04:48.013 --> 03:04:49.074]  No big deep cleanse needed.
[03:04:49.074 --> 03:04:51.015]  You just put it in water, drink it every day.
[03:04:51.015 --> 03:04:52.716]  Incredible what it's done for me and my family.
[03:04:52.716 --> 03:04:55.217]  And a bunch of other specials at Infowarslife.com.
[03:04:55.217 --> 03:04:57.419]  And those purchases from this operation, thank you for your support.
[03:04:59.418 --> 03:05:20.059]  I predict that Gardasil will become the greatest medical scandal of all times, because at some point in time, the evidence will add up to prove that this vaccine, technical and scientific feat that it may be, has absolutely no effect on cervical cancer, and that all the very many adverse effects, which destroy lives and even kill, serve no other purpose other than to generate profit for the manufacturers.
[03:05:20.399 --> 03:05:25.141]  That was a statement made in April 2014 by a French medical doctor, Bernard Delberg.
[03:05:25.141 --> 03:05:30.544]  He's a former pharmaceutical industry physician with Merck, the manufacturer of the HPV vaccine Gardasil.
[03:05:30.544 --> 03:05:38.348]  And now, almost two years later, Dr. Sing-Hang Lee, director of the Milford Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory in Connecticut, has proved these predictions correct.
[03:05:38.348 --> 03:05:39.749]  He published a letter sent to the U.S.
[03:05:39.749 --> 03:05:42.770]  CDC, the World Health Organization, and the Ministry of Health in Japan.
[03:05:42.790 --> 03:05:43.270]  I think so.

[03:07:02.118 --> 03:07:03.339]  But where do you get it?
[03:07:03.339 --> 03:07:08.265]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that
[03:07:08.285 --> 03:07:09.306]  It is like no other.

[03:07:15.212 --> 03:07:32.089]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[03:08:00.370 --> 03:08:03.292]  This is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[03:08:03.292 --> 03:08:07.355]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[03:08:07.355 --> 03:08:09.576]  The chair is against the wall.
[03:08:09.576 --> 03:08:11.258]  John has a long mustache.
[03:08:11.258 --> 03:08:14.660]  This is the heart of 1776!
[03:08:14.660 --> 03:08:15.961]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans.
[03:08:15.961 --> 03:08:17.482]  Another day closer to victory.
[03:08:17.482 --> 03:08:21.625]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[03:08:31.244 --> 03:08:32.085]  Welcome back.
[03:08:32.085 --> 03:08:33.005]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:08:33.005 --> 03:08:33.746]  It's Thursday.
[03:08:33.746 --> 03:08:35.827]  This is the Alex Jones Show Overdrive.
[03:08:35.827 --> 03:08:36.928]  We're gonna have a lot of fun today.
[03:08:36.928 --> 03:08:38.869]  There's a lot of crazy news.
[03:08:38.869 --> 03:08:41.190]  Truly, truly crazy news.
[03:08:41.190 --> 03:08:54.619]  And, there's some good news as well, but mainly, I've got some very interesting information about what the FBI is doing to spy on high school kids, and how the FBI is warning that car hacking is real and what you can do about it.
[03:08:54.619 --> 03:08:58.982]  But beyond that, we're gonna play a David Knight video that's really important first, and we'll be right back with some more news.
[03:08:58.982 --> 03:08:59.282]  Here it is.
[03:09:01.229 --> 03:09:02.990]  David Knight from Infowars.com.
[03:09:02.990 --> 03:09:21.746]  I'm here in Colonial Williamsburg, and every time I spend or have to go to Washington, D.C., and witness this empire that has become everything that the founders of this country detested, I like to come by this place, because it's a meticulous recreation of the American colonies right as the American Revolution was beginning.
[03:09:22.934 --> 03:09:28.939]  And it's nice to reattach to these founding principles, to the optimism, to the liberty that was there.
[03:09:28.939 --> 03:09:30.780]  Behind me is the House of Burgess.
[03:09:30.780 --> 03:09:35.444]  This is where the legislative body met for Virginia.
[03:09:35.444 --> 03:09:38.486]  And in this other direction over here is Shields Tavern.
[03:09:38.486 --> 03:09:40.327]  Shields Tavern was where we just ate lunch.
[03:09:40.327 --> 03:09:45.351]  And what they do is they have historical and actors, people in costume, who will come by your table.
[03:09:45.351 --> 03:09:51.956]  They'll talk to the crowd in the room, give them some stories about what life was like at the time, and character.
[03:09:52.816 --> 03:10:00.684]  This lady was saying that they would like to run up large bills because they didn't like to handle a lot of money.
[03:10:00.684 --> 03:10:03.166]  She said that they would take the dollars, they would cut them into pieces of eight.
[03:10:03.166 --> 03:10:09.072]  That's a whole other story I won't go into, but she told us about one particular customer, George Washington.
[03:10:09.072 --> 03:10:16.780]  She said he ran up a rather large bill of 21 days, staying there, food and lodging, and he left that bill for over a year and a half, and that was not uncommon.
[03:10:17.441 --> 03:10:23.762]  But he came by here and settled his bill in 1775 as he was on his way to the Continental Congress.
[03:10:23.762 --> 03:10:25.763]  Concord and Lexington had just happened.
[03:10:25.763 --> 03:10:26.903]  He knew there was going to be a war.
[03:10:26.903 --> 03:10:30.244]  He thought he might die, so he wanted to settle his accounts.
[03:10:30.244 --> 03:10:35.645]  She also talked about how when he went to the Continental Congress, he met with John Adams.
[03:10:35.645 --> 03:10:44.547]  John Adams, a man who doesn't like anyone, did not like anyone, took a great deal of liking to George Washington, thought he was a very intelligent and honest man.
[03:10:45.245 --> 03:10:49.267]  Said he was going to nominate him to be the commanding general of the Continental Army.
[03:10:49.267 --> 03:10:50.307]  And he did that the next day.
[03:10:50.307 --> 03:10:52.949]  And George Washington showed up in uniform.
[03:10:52.949 --> 03:10:53.709]  He was nominated.
[03:10:53.709 --> 03:11:02.413]  And showing up in uniform was not to impress people, but it was to quietly convey that he was available for the office.
[03:11:02.413 --> 03:11:04.774]  Very understated way to do this.
[03:11:04.774 --> 03:11:08.235]  As they nominated him and proceeded to vote, he left.
[03:11:08.235 --> 03:11:11.257]  Now I want to contrast that with Ted Cruz.
[03:11:12.347 --> 03:11:16.790]  A man who epitomizes ruthless ambition without principles.
[03:11:16.790 --> 03:11:19.171]  Dishonest and desperate.
[03:11:19.171 --> 03:11:30.838]  We've seen Ted Cruz, just over the last couple of weeks, throw Donald Trump and his supporters under the bus saying they were to blame because they didn't use the gentle language of political correctness.
[03:11:31.716 --> 03:11:46.647]  Saying that they were to blame for the people who infiltrated their rallies, who aggressively confronted people, and then went out in the parking lot and stopped ambulances, attacked cars that had bumper stickers that they didn't like, damaging those cars.
[03:11:46.647 --> 03:11:51.810]  Today, we see something even more amazing, and I want to read you this quote from Ted Cruz.
[03:11:52.935 --> 03:11:57.357]  This is what he said in response to the shootings in Brussels.
[03:11:57.357 --> 03:12:10.403]  He said, well, I will say it's striking that the day after Donald Trump called for America weakening NATO, withdrawing from NATO, we see Brussels, where NATO is headquartered, the subject of a radical Islamist terror attack.
[03:12:10.403 --> 03:12:14.885]  So Donald Trump is wrong that America should withdraw from the world and abandon our allies.
[03:12:14.885 --> 03:12:19.587]  Donald Trump is wrong that America should retreat from Europe.
[03:12:19.587 --> 03:12:20.588]  Now, I want to ask you,
[03:12:21.539 --> 03:12:25.802]  What would the founders of our country say to a man like Ted Cruz?
[03:12:25.802 --> 03:12:31.967]  A man who puts his own personal ambition ahead of the eligibility requirements in the Constitution.
[03:12:31.967 --> 03:12:35.890]  Who says that we need to be at a state of perpetual war.
[03:12:35.890 --> 03:12:42.975]  And who takes every opportunity to throw his political opponents under the bus in the most dishonest ways.
[03:12:42.975 --> 03:12:44.056]  That is Ted Cruz.
[03:12:44.056 --> 03:12:44.697]  It's not enough.
[03:12:45.217 --> 03:12:49.323]  For him to go to AIPAC yesterday and be the most groveling of all the candidates.
[03:12:49.323 --> 03:12:57.735]  I thought it was disgusting that we have to have our presidential candidates parade before people who put the foreign interests of another country ahead of America.
[03:12:58.246 --> 03:13:01.128]  We should never put Israel's interests ahead of America.
[03:13:01.128 --> 03:13:03.889]  No other country should be put ahead of America.
[03:13:03.889 --> 03:13:05.870]  We need America first.
[03:13:05.870 --> 03:13:07.511]  This is America.
[03:13:07.511 --> 03:13:09.632]  And this is what... We're having an election here.
[03:13:09.632 --> 03:13:17.036]  We should not put the interests of Mexico, or Israel, or France, or Belgium, anyone ahead of Americans' interests.
[03:13:17.036 --> 03:13:19.278]  But that's what they did for Israel yesterday.
[03:13:19.278 --> 03:13:23.520]  And of all the sycophants there, the worst one was Ted Cruz.
[03:13:24.631 --> 03:13:27.213]  Donald Trump is even saying we need to pull back from NATO.
[03:13:27.213 --> 03:13:30.035]  We need to distance ourselves from the United Nations control.
[03:13:30.035 --> 03:13:34.458]  Even, you know, it's not in your interest, Israel, to have the United Nations controlling your country either.
[03:13:34.458 --> 03:13:37.801]  He's pulling back from the globalism to some degree.
[03:13:37.801 --> 03:13:42.604]  I would like to see a complete repudiation of the American empire.
[03:13:42.604 --> 03:13:45.467]  And we were warned by our founders that it would become despotic at home.
[03:13:46.673 --> 03:13:49.575]  That it would become the very thing that we are fighting abroad.
[03:13:49.575 --> 03:13:53.178]  It was John Adams who said, we don't go abroad seeking monsters to destroy.
[03:13:53.178 --> 03:13:54.179]  Now we do.
[03:13:54.179 --> 03:13:54.919]  Now we do.
[03:13:54.919 --> 03:13:58.002]  And if we don't have those monsters, we create those monsters.
[03:13:58.002 --> 03:14:05.888]  And we keep ourselves perpetually tied together in these foreign entanglements that George Washington warned us about.
[03:14:05.888 --> 03:14:08.710]  For InfoWars.com, at Colonial Williamsburg, I'm David Knight.
[03:14:09.420 --> 03:14:11.483]  There's a few thoughts from David Knight.
[03:14:11.483 --> 03:14:21.354]  You know, what's interesting to me is that when something horrible happens, like what happened in Brussels with the terrorist attacks, a truly tragic event, the news focus changes completely.
[03:14:21.354 --> 03:14:22.275]  And for good reason, right?
[03:14:22.275 --> 03:14:23.797]  Why wouldn't we want to discuss these things?
[03:14:23.797 --> 03:14:24.358]  We have to.
[03:14:24.358 --> 03:14:25.719]  It's the biggest event out there.
[03:14:26.340 --> 03:14:32.422]  But what also happens is, it's kind of like a magnifying glass and there's a huge, huge map, right?
[03:14:32.422 --> 03:14:34.123]  And we're just looking at one thing.
[03:14:34.123 --> 03:14:38.165]  And again, obviously we have to talk about these things, it's the biggest thing out there.
[03:14:38.165 --> 03:14:46.128]  But what I've got in front of me is news that no one's paying attention to because of all of the mania and the craziness behind Brussels.
[03:14:46.508 --> 03:14:47.648]  And again, it is craziness.
[03:14:47.648 --> 03:14:48.148]  It is mania.
[03:14:48.148 --> 03:14:49.409]  There's stuff to talk about, right?
[03:14:49.409 --> 03:14:50.429]  It is big, huge news.
[03:14:50.429 --> 03:14:51.829]  We should be discussing it.
[03:14:51.829 --> 03:14:57.291]  But at the same time, I've got a pretty big stack here that I haven't seen anyone else talk about.
[03:14:57.291 --> 03:15:00.372]  And what I wanted to do is we'll cover some Brussels stuff for sure.
[03:15:00.372 --> 03:15:02.732]  And we're going to take some calls also, by the way.
[03:15:02.732 --> 03:15:06.573]  And the callers on the line, I don't want to drop you.
[03:15:06.573 --> 03:15:09.614]  I don't want to drop you, but I want you to be on topic with what we're talking about now.
[03:15:11.415 --> 03:15:13.257]  Let's do that, because I don't want to drop you.
[03:15:13.257 --> 03:15:18.602]  I know you've been waiting, so I don't want to be disrespectful in that way, but we have to be on topic now, and I will answer your questions.
[03:15:18.602 --> 03:15:20.965]  I'm also taking some questions on Twitter.
[03:15:20.965 --> 03:15:27.951]  I'm going to read those live on air, so if you tweet me at ASGucciArt, I'm going to read some questions on air so everyone can get their questions in.
[03:15:28.939 --> 03:15:34.665]  But look, again, the Brussels thing is huge, but there's so much going on in these stacks that we need to talk about.
[03:15:34.665 --> 03:15:45.637]  One thing that people also seem to miss back earlier in March, and then we're going to get some more breaking news, is what the FBI is doing with a new plan to spy on children in the classroom.
[03:15:45.637 --> 03:15:47.419]  So not even just spy on adults.
[03:15:48.360 --> 03:15:58.384]  Children whose brains are developing and they have no idea what's even going on, they're using new surveillance programs to urge teachers to report students critical of government policies and western corruption.
[03:15:58.384 --> 03:15:59.484]  This is from Alternet.
[03:15:59.484 --> 03:16:03.186]  This story is absurd.
[03:16:03.186 --> 03:16:06.167]  This is one of those stories too where you can share with somebody and send it to them?
[03:16:06.977 --> 03:16:12.784]  When they say, everything's great, the people that run the country just love you and you're crazy and you're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:16:12.784 --> 03:16:17.169]  If you question anything about the establishment, this is a great story to send.
[03:16:17.169 --> 03:16:23.376]  So under new guidelines, the FBI is instructing high school students across the country to report students who do what?
[03:16:23.376 --> 03:16:27.400]  Criticize government policies and quote, Western corruption.
[03:16:28.362 --> 03:16:29.724]  What are they going to report them as?
[03:16:29.724 --> 03:16:31.887]  Potential future terrorists.
[03:16:31.887 --> 03:16:42.442]  Warning that anarchists, extremists are in the same category as ISIS and young people who are poor immigrants or travel to suspicious countries are more likely to commit horrific violence.
[03:16:42.442 --> 03:16:43.284]  So let me tell you something.
[03:16:44.622 --> 03:16:59.413]  People that like to align with the political leaders that are part of the very, very deeply entrenched establishment system and think they get power from doing so, and think they get power from debating on behalf of the truly corrupt, quote-unquote, Western corruption that I'm discussing.
[03:16:59.413 --> 03:17:01.454]  I'm now a terrorist under these guidelines.
[03:17:02.535 --> 03:17:10.006]  Those are the people that will read something like this and their illusion, their facade will just be shattered like glass.
[03:17:10.006 --> 03:17:11.809]  Like a bullet to glass.
[03:17:11.809 --> 03:17:13.852]  And they will just say, wait a minute, what?
[03:17:13.852 --> 03:17:17.297]  It's politically correct.
[03:17:18.158 --> 03:17:23.720]  Politically correct to, you know, protect the very people that they're now saying are terrorists?
[03:17:23.720 --> 03:17:25.040]  Very, very strange, right?
[03:17:25.040 --> 03:17:32.903]  So it says, again, young people who are poor immigrants and travel to suspicious countries are more likely to commit horrific violence.
[03:17:32.903 --> 03:17:35.023]  They are more likely, I guess, to be classified as terrorists.
[03:17:35.023 --> 03:17:36.564]  This is from Alternet.
[03:17:36.564 --> 03:17:40.785]  This isn't something I'm making up from a blog or something that I read on Twitter.
[03:17:40.785 --> 03:17:43.426]  This is from a news source that uses
[03:17:44.554 --> 03:17:46.397]  Uh, citations and it's on Salon too.
[03:17:46.397 --> 03:17:49.942]  So it's not a so-called any type of right-wing conspiracy or whatever.
[03:17:49.942 --> 03:17:51.164]  It's on Salon as well.
[03:17:51.164 --> 03:17:53.307]  FBI is planning to spy on high school kids.
[03:17:53.307 --> 03:17:59.937]  So it just brings you back to the reality that maybe the people that are deeply entrenched in the establishment that are corrupt aren't on your side.
[03:18:00.658 --> 03:18:08.403]  Wait a minute, maybe it's the grassroots opposition and independent thinkers and people that actually care about you and humanity and the future that are on your side.
[03:18:08.403 --> 03:18:10.225]  Could that be possible?
[03:18:10.225 --> 03:18:11.605]  Consider for one moment, right?
[03:18:11.605 --> 03:18:14.127]  Consider for one moment that I actually care about you.
[03:18:14.127 --> 03:18:21.672]  Consider for one moment that I actually care about the future of not only this country but this planet and intellectual thought.
[03:18:21.672 --> 03:18:28.277]  Consider for a moment that independent media actually cares as opposed to the establishment that you try to draw power from, some of you.
[03:18:29.042 --> 03:18:30.943]  Very, very sad, but very, very eye-opening.
[03:18:30.943 --> 03:18:38.187]  And at the same time, you know, I was sitting in my car earlier today and it has one of those fobs where you can unlock it and lock it and trigger the alarm or whatever.
[03:18:39.167 --> 03:18:46.372]  I was thinking, gosh, people keep acting like that their car is so safe and secure.
[03:18:46.372 --> 03:18:51.395]  We've got people that are hacking into NSA databases.
[03:18:51.395 --> 03:19:00.321]  All right, like 14 year olds that are like DDoSing websites and hacking into government establishment databases that use super high quality, amazing,
[03:19:01.221 --> 03:19:02.402]  Firewalls and everything like that.
[03:19:02.402 --> 03:19:03.802]  They're just breaking into it.
[03:19:03.802 --> 03:19:08.104]  Why are we thinking that people aren't soon going to develop easy systems to get into our cars?
[03:19:08.104 --> 03:19:09.945]  I mean, they set them up just like that.
[03:19:09.945 --> 03:19:16.367]  They set them up, obviously, so they can, you know, the car manufacturers or law enforcement or whatever can get into them.
[03:19:16.367 --> 03:19:17.768]  Well, guess who else can also get into them?
[03:19:18.268 --> 03:19:19.669]  People that are going to develop these technologies.
[03:19:19.669 --> 03:19:22.412]  It's already been done with a number of different brands I saw.
[03:19:22.412 --> 03:19:25.195]  They said, yeah, well, you know, the way it works.
[03:19:25.195 --> 03:19:33.603]  And the so-called white hat hackers, which are actually amazing, awesome people that I very much respect, they figure out how to get into these things in the interest of public safety.
[03:19:33.603 --> 03:19:36.326]  And they're learning more and more how they're getting into these cars.
[03:19:36.326 --> 03:19:40.630]  So when we get back here in a moment, we're going to talk about how people can actually hack into your vehicle.
[03:19:41.230 --> 03:19:44.395]  And some stuff that you could maybe do to prevent it and where that's all heading.
[03:19:44.395 --> 03:19:46.878]  Some very interesting stuff and a lot more news coming right back.
[03:19:46.878 --> 03:19:49.422]  Anthony Gucciardi, this is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:59.500 --> 03:20:04.323]  Wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, a crashing economy.
[03:20:04.323 --> 03:20:05.444]  Are you ready?

[03:20:08.185 --> 03:20:10.567]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?

[03:22:28.789 --> 03:22:31.851]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[03:22:31.851 --> 03:22:34.472]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[03:22:34.472 --> 03:22:35.212]  Croix River.
[03:22:35.212 --> 03:22:37.453]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[03:22:37.453 --> 03:22:40.415]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[03:22:40.415 --> 03:22:41.295]  His excuse?
[03:22:41.295 --> 03:22:42.616]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[03:22:42.616 --> 03:22:44.237]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[03:22:44.237 --> 03:22:50.000]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[03:22:58.669 --> 03:23:02.612]  Hey everyone, in 20-plus years as a radio host, I've seen about everything.
[03:23:02.612 --> 03:23:07.036]  One thing that keeps recurring though, are these timeshare charlatans.
[03:23:07.036 --> 03:23:18.865]  These high-pressure salespeople who get folks to come out to some resort for a special weekend offer, then they get them in a corner and browbeat them and coerce them into buying a timeshare they don't need, they don't want, and they can't afford.
[03:23:18.865 --> 03:23:20.867]  And then they're stuck with that thing forever.
[03:23:20.867 --> 03:23:24.410]  Monthly payments, mortgage payments, annual fees that keep going up and up.
[03:23:24.910 --> 03:23:27.972]  Well, up until recently, people thought they couldn't get rid of these things.
[03:23:27.972 --> 03:23:31.315]  You know, you can't get out of the contract, you can't get out of the deed or the membership.
[03:23:31.315 --> 03:23:32.656]  Well, that's not true.
[03:23:32.656 --> 03:23:38.280]  My friends at American Consumer Credit, a timeshare release company, can get you free.
[03:23:38.280 --> 03:23:40.382]  That's their personal guarantee.

[03:23:48.770 --> 03:23:49.111]  800-587-EXIT.
[03:23:49.111 --> 03:23:49.291]  Call now.
[03:23:49.291 --> 03:23:49.331]  800-587-3948.
[03:24:04.514 --> 03:24:05.315]  Alright, we're back.
[03:24:05.315 --> 03:24:07.820]  We're going to talk a little bit more about this car hacking stuff.
[03:24:07.820 --> 03:24:08.921]  It's very, very interesting.
[03:24:08.921 --> 03:24:17.576]  We're going to talk about how hackers could get into your vehicle and how the FBI and the government are saying, watch out for the hackers.
[03:24:18.553 --> 03:24:27.838]  And it's funny to me because the manufacturers and the law enforcement agencies, of course, worked to build in all the smart technologies that now they're warning you against and saying you could be hacked at any time.
[03:24:27.838 --> 03:24:30.600]  So we're going to talk about that in a minute, maybe what you can do about it.
[03:24:30.600 --> 03:24:34.162]  But first, what I want to do is I want to continue to take some more calls.
[03:24:34.162 --> 03:24:37.123]  We have some people patiently waiting, but we're going to open up those phone lines.
[03:24:37.123 --> 03:24:38.244]  And here's what I want to talk about.
[03:24:39.639 --> 03:24:42.262]  So there's an article that came out this month.
[03:24:42.262 --> 03:24:48.048]  For 80 years, young Americans have been getting more anxious and depressed and no one is quite sure why.
[03:24:48.048 --> 03:24:53.333]  And that ties also in with an article about how depression is more than just a mental disorder.
[03:24:53.333 --> 03:24:54.234]  It affects the whole organism.
[03:24:54.234 --> 03:24:56.016]  Basically, it's killing you if you're depressed.
[03:24:56.016 --> 03:25:01.742]  And they say they don't know why people are so depressed and upset and their dreams have been crushed for the last 80 years.
[03:25:01.742 --> 03:25:02.783]  We don't know what's going on.
[03:25:03.820 --> 03:25:07.904]  Well, I have a theory and a few thoughts on that that I think 100% answer the question.
[03:25:07.904 --> 03:25:11.988]  So I'm going to get to that as well and tell you my thoughts on it, but I want to know what you think.
[03:25:11.988 --> 03:25:13.709]  Why do you think people are so upset?
[03:25:13.709 --> 03:25:15.010]  Why do you think they're so depressed?
[03:25:15.010 --> 03:25:17.132]  Why do you feel like they're so defeated?
[03:25:17.132 --> 03:25:27.902]  Why do they wake up in the morning and think, it's Monday, I hate my life, I can't last another week, I cannot wait till it's Friday, God, I just want to get out of this, this society is terrible.
[03:25:27.902 --> 03:25:29.204]  Why are people so frustrated?
[03:25:30.199 --> 03:25:35.304]  Could it be because they're led into a false hope and a false dream?
[03:25:35.304 --> 03:25:42.910]  Could it be that they are treated in an establishment meat grinder where their hopes and dreams go to die?
[03:25:42.910 --> 03:25:52.699]  Where they're worked until they're a ripe old age of retirement and they're told that they must think and act a certain way and they're not allowed to do anything that is out of the ordinary?
[03:25:52.699 --> 03:25:54.321]  I think that might be it and we'll get into that too.
[03:25:54.321 --> 03:25:55.322]  So give me a call.
[03:25:56.024 --> 03:25:57.164]  We've got a few open.
[03:25:57.164 --> 03:26:01.125]  We've got some people still waiting, I believe, but why are people so upset right now?
[03:26:01.125 --> 03:26:02.206]  Your thoughts on that.
[03:26:02.206 --> 03:26:03.566]  So call in.
[03:26:03.566 --> 03:26:06.327]  But back to this car hacking for a moment.
[03:26:06.327 --> 03:26:07.767]  For a moment.
[03:26:07.767 --> 03:26:19.430]  It's been eight months since a pair of security researchers proved beyond any doubt that car hacking is more than an action movie plot device, wherein they remotely killed the transmission of a 2014 Jeep Cherokee as it drove down St.
[03:26:19.430 --> 03:26:20.530]  Louis, as I drove down St.
[03:26:20.530 --> 03:26:20.990]  Louis Highway.
[03:26:20.990 --> 03:26:22.771]  This is written in first person in an article.
[03:26:23.311 --> 03:26:30.295]  Now the FBI has caught up with the news and it's warning Americans to take the risk of vehicular cyber-sabotage seriously.
[03:26:30.295 --> 03:26:31.516]  Yeah, of course.
[03:26:31.516 --> 03:26:35.458]  Like I said, they hack Chinese government systems.
[03:26:35.458 --> 03:26:36.638]  By the way, the call-in number is 1-800-259-9231.
[03:26:36.638 --> 03:26:38.179]  1-800-259-9231 to call on those issues I just talked about.
[03:26:43.502 --> 03:26:57.275]  So now the FBI is giving out a public service announcement saying the Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic and all those blah blah blah is saying watch out for over-the-internet attacks on cars and trucks.
[03:26:57.275 --> 03:27:01.839]  The announcement doesn't reveal any sign the agencies have learned about incidents of car hacking that weren't already public.
[03:27:01.839 --> 03:27:03.420]  Yeah, I'm sure that's never happened before.
[03:27:03.420 --> 03:27:04.922]  Definitely not.
[03:27:06.508 --> 03:27:15.450]  Quote, modern motor vehicles often include new connected vehicle technologies that aim to provide benefits such as added safety features, improved fuel economy, and greater overall convenience.
[03:27:15.450 --> 03:27:22.672]  The public service announcement reads, aftermarket devices are also providing consumers with new features to monitor the status of their vehicles.
[03:27:22.672 --> 03:27:27.914]  This increased connectivity is important to consumers and manufacturers to maintain awareness of potential cyber security threats.
[03:27:27.914 --> 03:27:28.774]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:27:29.734 --> 03:27:38.857]  And the problem is, you can't push that kind of stuff and say how great it is for law enforcement and for the manufacturers and stuff and say, well it's actually kind of bad, you should really watch out.
[03:27:38.857 --> 03:27:43.999]  Thankfully we have white hat hackers who go in and hack it and try to give the information out.
[03:27:43.999 --> 03:27:48.581]  Jeep had to send everybody flash drives and do a recall of their vehicle because you could turn it off.
[03:27:48.581 --> 03:27:51.282]  And there's other ones that it mentions, you can turn the brakes off.
[03:27:51.282 --> 03:27:52.922]  It is crazy stuff.
[03:27:52.922 --> 03:27:58.124]  And one time I broke down on the side of the road and I pressed the little, you know, connected drive thing on my car.
[03:27:59.125 --> 03:28:00.626]  I've never used it before.
[03:28:00.626 --> 03:28:05.230]  It just kind of beeps sometimes and makes me wonder if it, you know, what it's doing.
[03:28:05.230 --> 03:28:09.753]  And so I press it and I thought I would have to explain, well, you know, I'm on such and such road.
[03:28:09.753 --> 03:28:11.474]  They're like, no, we have your exact GPS location.
[03:28:11.474 --> 03:28:13.496]  We'll be sending out an officer right away.
[03:28:13.496 --> 03:28:16.298]  And your nearest, you know, dealership is such and such.
[03:28:16.298 --> 03:28:19.681]  And the ETA is an hour and 10 minutes or whatever it is.
[03:28:19.681 --> 03:28:21.382]  And you need anything else.
[03:28:21.382 --> 03:28:24.424]  And we could even take some of the diagnostics from your vehicle.
[03:28:24.424 --> 03:28:26.125]  Pretty crazy stuff to think.
[03:28:26.966 --> 03:28:30.787]  Well gee, maybe someone could take advantage of that information.
[03:28:30.787 --> 03:28:35.189]  Maybe someone could take advantage of the GPS locations every single place you've gone.
[03:28:35.189 --> 03:28:40.111]  Maybe that metadata is really valuable to certain agencies or corporations.
[03:28:40.111 --> 03:28:42.732]  It's almost like, kind of like how Facebook sells metadata.
[03:28:42.732 --> 03:28:43.812]  That's really crazy.
[03:28:43.812 --> 03:28:46.934]  And it's obviously not just the metadata, right?
[03:28:46.934 --> 03:28:50.955]  So we're going to get into some more news before we come back and I've got a very special video for you to play.
[03:28:50.955 --> 03:28:53.556]  A play that Alex wants you to see.
[03:28:53.556 --> 03:28:55.317]  So we're going to play that when we come back as well.
[03:28:55.737 --> 03:28:58.159]  First, let's get into a little bit more news, and then we're going to take your calls.
[03:28:58.159 --> 03:29:00.061]  This is a super loaded show.
[03:29:00.061 --> 03:29:01.502]  Lots of stuff out there.
[03:29:01.502 --> 03:29:04.424]  One thing we've talked about before are super flares.
[03:29:04.424 --> 03:29:10.969]  And everyone seems to kind of talk about it for a little bit, and the scientists freak out and say there's a super flare that could happen, and no one cares.
[03:29:10.969 --> 03:29:12.711]  And I'm going to put this into perspective for you.
[03:29:13.550 --> 03:29:14.771]  What is a superflare?
[03:29:14.771 --> 03:29:18.074]  Researchers explain devastating consequences of an eruption from the sun.
[03:29:18.074 --> 03:29:19.935]  I'm going to tell you why I'm talking about this.
[03:29:19.935 --> 03:29:21.296]  Very important.
[03:29:21.296 --> 03:29:27.842]  So a superflare, if one erupted from the sun, it'll have a devastating effect on Earth and it goes on to talk about radio communication.
[03:29:27.842 --> 03:29:32.065]  A lot of stuff will be taken down and they say one could be coming, right?
[03:29:32.065 --> 03:29:39.251]  I'm going to tell you why that's important and what we could actually do to, you know, basically wrap our minds around the craziness.
[03:29:39.251 --> 03:29:41.172]  We'll be right back and I've got a video coming up as well.
[03:29:48.624 --> 03:29:51.645]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.645 --> 03:29:59.349]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.349 --> 03:30:12.735]  The left-leaning women from the popular daytime TV show The View are finally starting to admit that they agree with Donald Trump on his foreign policy and views on ISIS.
[03:30:12.735 --> 03:30:14.956]  I thought Donald Trump sounded really reasonable today.
[03:30:14.956 --> 03:30:16.357]  My law enforcement background
[03:30:16.357 --> 03:30:17.398]  Why do you say that?
[03:30:17.398 --> 03:30:18.338]  Isn't that crazy?
[03:30:18.338 --> 03:30:20.819]  Because we need to be forceful.
[03:30:20.819 --> 03:30:24.181]  We can't have these muted responses to terror.
[03:30:24.181 --> 03:30:26.202]  And let me also say this about Donald Trump.
[03:30:26.202 --> 03:30:28.683]  You know, we trash him often here.
[03:30:28.683 --> 03:30:32.205]  Bottom line is, in January, and you've been saying that, Raven.
[03:30:32.205 --> 03:30:32.926]  I've been saying that.
[03:30:32.926 --> 03:30:36.828]  In January of this year, he said Brussels was a hellhole.
[03:30:36.828 --> 03:30:39.769]  He said there is something going on, Maria, and it is not good.
[03:30:39.769 --> 03:30:40.990]  Talking about Belgium.
[03:30:40.990 --> 03:30:41.530]  He was right.
[03:30:41.530 --> 03:30:42.851]  So he's right on a couple of things.
[03:30:42.851 --> 03:30:45.412]  So his foreign policy isn't so outrageous.
[03:30:45.452 --> 03:30:48.135]  So is Donald Trump really the voice of reason?
[03:30:48.135 --> 03:30:50.639]  And which candidate makes you feel safer?
[03:30:50.639 --> 03:30:53.222]  Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?
[03:30:53.222 --> 03:30:58.188]  Let us know what you think in the comment section right now at InfoWars.com
[03:30:59.229 --> 03:31:05.133]  In the first decade of my battle against the globalists, I gained close to 100 pounds.
[03:31:05.133 --> 03:31:12.558]  Now in the last four years, with help from the products at Infowarslife.com, I have lost 80 plus pounds of that weight.
[03:31:12.558 --> 03:31:17.401]  And as many viewers have noted, the weight loss has accelerated in the last year.
[03:31:17.401 --> 03:31:21.343]  The big turning point was when I did my first liver cleanse.
[03:31:21.343 --> 03:31:25.346]  My friends, I have gotten a lot of dramatic results with the incredible products at Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:25.526 --> 03:31:32.616]  But the most dramatic hands down, and the reviewers agree with me, is the Ultimate Cleanse Pack and the results you will see.
[03:31:32.616 --> 03:31:41.208]  We're giving you 20% off the Ultimate Cleanse Pack with Liver Shield, Oxy Powder, and Deep Cleanse all combined with a huge 20% discount at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:31:41.488 --> 03:31:50.437]  A lot of my family and a lot of the office are now doing the cleanse with me, and so I'm challenging you, the fellow InfoWarriors, to take action with me and do the cleanse as well.
[03:31:50.437 --> 03:31:56.443]  Just go to InfoWarsLife.com for yourself, go to the liver cleanse, deep cleanse page, and see the facts.
[03:31:56.443 --> 03:31:57.845]  It is game changing.
[03:31:58.851 --> 03:31:59.672]  Hey, everyone!
[03:31:59.672 --> 03:32:01.974]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[03:32:01.974 --> 03:32:05.817]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:32:05.817 --> 03:32:07.899]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:32:07.899 --> 03:32:18.168]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:32:18.168 --> 03:32:24.154]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:32:24.614 --> 03:32:39.531]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[03:32:39.531 --> 03:32:40.211]  We're good to go.
[03:33:08.865 --> 03:33:11.128]  Alright, we're back with some George Strait.
[03:33:14.207 --> 03:33:18.509]  So, we were talking about super flares and the implications of a super flare.
[03:33:18.509 --> 03:33:27.932]  We've talked about that before and all the scientists just, they almost like to kind of like nerd out on the possibility of a super flare because it's such an insane thing, but it's a very devastating thing.
[03:33:27.932 --> 03:33:38.776]  But first, before we go into the super flare and what could be going down with that, I want to tell you about, first, we also have a video coming up, but before we even go to that, there's just so much stuff on this show, truly.
[03:33:38.776 --> 03:33:41.017]  There's so much news and so many videos and things to do.
[03:33:41.997 --> 03:33:52.082]  If you go to Infowarslife.com right now, the Ultimate Cleanse Pack, which is Oxy Powder, Liver Shield, and Deep Cleanse is 20% off.
[03:33:52.082 --> 03:33:57.945]  20% off, and it has everything you need to really start cleansing and doing a proper liver cleanse.
[03:33:57.945 --> 03:34:02.187]  So I've done about 7 liver cleanses.
[03:34:03.271 --> 03:34:08.054]  And let me tell you something, it's a dramatic difference.
[03:34:08.054 --> 03:34:11.077]  I don't want to get into too much detail here because it's kind of disgusting.
[03:34:11.077 --> 03:34:13.458]  You can imagine what happens when you're cleansing the liver, right?
[03:34:13.458 --> 03:34:19.903]  When you take these products, and you can take them individually, by the way, of course, you can take the Oxy-Powder, the Liver Shield, and the Deep Cleanse individually.
[03:34:19.903 --> 03:34:21.744]  You don't even have to do the full liver cleanse.
[03:34:21.744 --> 03:34:25.967]  You can just take it daily and it will definitely make a difference.
[03:34:25.967 --> 03:34:31.511]  But if you want to do a liver cleanse, if you want to do a liver cleanse, you will not regret it.
[03:34:32.111 --> 03:34:34.574]  I've talked to a bunch of people that were just like, oh, liver cleanse.
[03:34:34.574 --> 03:34:34.954]  I don't know.
[03:34:34.954 --> 03:34:35.995]  I don't know if I could handle that.
[03:34:35.995 --> 03:34:38.378]  Let me tell you, you'll want to handle it.
[03:34:38.378 --> 03:34:40.681]  And when you do it and you see what comes out of you.
[03:34:41.826 --> 03:34:43.987]  You'll realize it's the real deal.
[03:34:43.987 --> 03:34:50.471]  If you go to InfoWarsLife.com and click on the Ultimate Cleanse Pack, you can read the reviews for yourself, not just from me.
[03:34:50.471 --> 03:34:55.734]  There's lots of listeners that are on there talking about their experiences detailing it.
[03:34:55.734 --> 03:34:57.695]  If you click on LiverShield, you can read those reviews.
[03:34:57.695 --> 03:35:04.919]  The Ultimate Cleanse Pack is new, obviously, so it might not have all those reviews, but there are thousands throughout OxyPowder, LiverShield, and Deep Cleanse.
[03:35:04.919 --> 03:35:08.421]  And plus, it's 20% off, so now's the time to stock up on all those products.
[03:35:08.421 --> 03:35:08.702]  To me,
[03:35:09.602 --> 03:35:14.286]  You're going to probably get them anyway if you're a regular user, so why not get them when they're 20% off.
[03:35:14.286 --> 03:35:17.729]  So today is the day, Ultimate Cleanse Pack, 20% off.
[03:35:17.729 --> 03:35:20.472]  But, you know, don't take it from me, right?
[03:35:20.472 --> 03:35:26.877]  Take it from someone that is way more attractive that recently did a liver cleanse with her friend, and that's Leanne McAdoo.
[03:35:26.877 --> 03:35:32.222]  So we're going to play her video and her results of the liver cleanse, and she's going to break it down for you.
[03:35:32.222 --> 03:35:32.943]  So let's watch that video.
[03:35:34.315 --> 03:35:36.496]  Well, myself and Emmy Robin are here.
[03:35:36.496 --> 03:35:39.958]  We're getting ready to do the liver shield cleanse.
[03:35:39.958 --> 03:35:40.978]  Very excited!
[03:35:40.978 --> 03:35:47.961]  As you can see here, the night before the first day is all about prepping.
[03:35:47.961 --> 03:35:52.964]  So that is what we have going on here and I felt pretty good rolling out of the grocery store.
[03:35:53.744 --> 03:35:54.745]  Looking like a health nut.
[03:35:54.745 --> 03:36:00.088]  Well, we're checking in for Day 2 of the Info Wars Life Liver Shield Cleanse.
[03:36:00.088 --> 03:36:03.290]  I gotta say, crankier today than yesterday.
[03:36:03.290 --> 03:36:04.931]  Emmy to the rescue.
[03:36:04.931 --> 03:36:09.633]  Once again, she's brought me some delicious food to try to tame the beast.
[03:36:09.633 --> 03:36:12.055]  She's been a real Hillary Clinton.
[03:36:12.055 --> 03:36:13.556]  Yeah, but we're still hanging in there.
[03:36:13.556 --> 03:36:14.896]  Hope you guys are too.
[03:36:14.896 --> 03:36:18.939]  Be sure to check out the product, InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:36:18.939 --> 03:36:22.501]  It's the Liver Shield Cleanse along with the Oxy Powder.
[03:36:23.161 --> 03:36:27.743]  And you don't have to go all the way and take the liver cleanse challenge, but I highly recommend it.
[03:36:27.743 --> 03:36:31.484]  And that's me, Evil Queen, on day two.
[03:36:31.484 --> 03:36:32.064]  You can do it.
[03:36:32.064 --> 03:36:32.984]  I can do it.
[03:36:32.984 --> 03:36:33.624]  You can do it.
[03:36:33.624 --> 03:36:39.166]  Hi guys, here we are checking in day three of the Info Wars Life Liver Shield Cleanse.
[03:36:39.166 --> 03:36:44.868]  I gotta say, today I thought I was expecting it to be really intense and cranky and bad, but I feel pretty good.
[03:36:45.228 --> 03:36:46.429]  Nice!
[03:36:46.429 --> 03:36:47.530]  I'm glad.
[03:36:47.530 --> 03:36:53.595]  I got a little dizzy today, I'm not going to lie, and then the cravings have come on, like I said, on day three.
[03:36:53.595 --> 03:36:54.816]  It's always towards the end of the day.
[03:36:54.816 --> 03:37:06.885]  Of course, when I was driving over here, here at Commercial for Cake Pops, I don't even eat cake, nor do I eat cake pops, but they sound delicious right now, so I might have to try one on Monday or Tuesday.
[03:37:06.885 --> 03:37:10.007]  But yeah, it's weird.
[03:37:10.007 --> 03:37:13.310]  Day three, for some reason, no matter how many times I cleanse, and I've cleansed a lot,
[03:37:13.890 --> 03:37:16.713]  Day three, I always just get the strangest craving.
[03:37:16.713 --> 03:37:18.434]  We're not using pharmaceutical drugs.
[03:37:18.434 --> 03:37:25.820]  We're not, you know, I've seen so many posts of people getting their gallbladders taken out and people don't understand, like, it's not like your wisdom teeth.
[03:37:25.820 --> 03:37:35.447]  Like, your gallbladder is a huge horse organ along with your liver that cleanses your body and you can't just take that out because it helps cleanse the body.
[03:37:35.447 --> 03:37:38.870]  So why not try a cleanse and get rid of the stuff in the gallbladder?
[03:37:39.090 --> 03:37:43.811]  As promised, we are checking in for Day 4 of the Info Wars Life Liver Shield Cleanse.
[03:37:43.811 --> 03:37:45.492]  I gotta say, Emmy, you were right.
[03:37:45.492 --> 03:37:47.753]  Day 4, I feel tremendous.
[03:37:47.753 --> 03:37:57.095]  Woke up this morning feeling really light, a lot of clarity, no hunger pains, and I actually felt like I was floating through the grocery store.
[03:37:57.095 --> 03:37:59.876]  Everyone was sort of looking at me like, oh, pardon me.
[03:37:59.876 --> 03:38:01.236]  Oh, excuse me.
[03:38:01.236 --> 03:38:02.937]  And I wasn't in there cute or anything.
[03:38:02.937 --> 03:38:06.378]  Like, it just was like, I feel like I am glowing.
[03:38:06.818 --> 03:38:08.279]  And you're not even that hungry, right?
[03:38:08.279 --> 03:38:09.080]  No, not at all.
[03:38:09.080 --> 03:38:11.422]  I didn't even want to eat today because I felt so good.
[03:38:11.422 --> 03:38:12.062]  Yeah.
[03:38:12.062 --> 03:38:17.706]  So obviously this cleanse for me has really showed me that it is all about retraining our brain.
[03:38:17.706 --> 03:38:21.469]  Like I said, how can you resist tyranny if you can't resist the taco stand?
[03:38:21.469 --> 03:38:25.252]  Now, if you want to see our before and after photos, I think they said they've got them ready.
[03:38:26.132 --> 03:38:31.616]  Like I said, mine are before and almost after because I'm not done with my flush.
[03:38:31.616 --> 03:38:36.819]  But you can see those if you go to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:38:36.819 --> 03:38:39.240]  Whoa, Emi, flat on a pancake.
[03:38:39.240 --> 03:38:44.343]  I was, I promise you, I promise you, I was not sticking out in that first picture.
[03:38:44.343 --> 03:38:46.104]  I just literally was relaxed.
[03:38:46.104 --> 03:38:48.285]  And even in the second picture, I was relaxed.
[03:38:48.285 --> 03:38:48.666]  But like,
[03:38:49.366 --> 03:38:50.207]  Look at that!
[03:38:50.207 --> 03:38:51.149]  It's crazy!
[03:38:51.149 --> 03:38:52.831]  Look at those butts in your side!
[03:38:52.831 --> 03:38:55.074]  No, I know, I can see the muscles in my stomach.
[03:38:55.074 --> 03:38:56.276]  It's nuts.
[03:38:56.276 --> 03:38:58.099]  And my legs, I feel like my legs look skinnier.
[03:38:58.099 --> 03:39:04.868]  I don't know, I started off at like a, I mean, for my height, I'm almost 5'9", so I started off at
[03:39:05.689 --> 03:39:15.112]  Relatively healthy weight because I had done the liver cleanse in July and then I went straight into working on a production for three months where I was working 18-hour days on my feet doing like eight miles a day.
[03:39:15.112 --> 03:39:16.832]  So, I mean, I wasn't super out of shape.
[03:39:16.832 --> 03:39:19.873]  But when I started that first liver cleanse, I was pretty out of shape.
[03:39:19.873 --> 03:39:20.613]  So that before and after.
[03:39:20.613 --> 03:39:24.335]  Yeah, you said you're actually at the lowest weight of your... Pretty much.
[03:39:24.335 --> 03:39:25.375]  ...in a decade, I guess.
[03:39:25.375 --> 03:39:26.255]  Yeah, pretty much.
[03:39:26.255 --> 03:39:28.396]  I'm almost back to where when I was a fitness model.
[03:39:29.632 --> 03:39:32.174]  Do they have my before and almost afters?
[03:39:32.174 --> 03:39:33.475]  Are we going to hold those off?
[03:39:33.475 --> 03:39:34.776]  Oh my goodness gracious!
[03:39:34.776 --> 03:39:35.977]  Holy moly!
[03:39:35.977 --> 03:39:36.757]  Look at you!
[03:39:36.757 --> 03:39:39.699]  Yeah, I can see it in your arms and your legs.
[03:39:39.699 --> 03:39:43.862]  Well, where I really see it and where I really wanted it was in my sides.
[03:39:43.862 --> 03:39:48.265]  I guess you would call that the spare tire and you can actually see where there's that little roll.
[03:39:48.265 --> 03:39:50.667]  Oh my god, this is so embarrassing.
[03:39:50.667 --> 03:39:54.650]  There's that little roll kind of on the back fat and you can see it's
[03:39:55.430 --> 03:39:55.870]  Gone away.
[03:39:55.870 --> 03:39:56.530]  Look at your chin.
[03:39:56.530 --> 03:39:57.791]  Look below your chin now.
[03:39:57.791 --> 03:39:58.531]  Oh my gosh!
[03:39:58.531 --> 03:40:00.972]  You see, you lose a little bit in your face too.
[03:40:00.972 --> 03:40:03.212]  That's where I saw it big time the first time around.
[03:40:03.212 --> 03:40:04.233]  There you go everyone.
[03:40:04.233 --> 03:40:05.153]  Before and afters.
[03:40:05.153 --> 03:40:07.474]  And like I said, mine is not even an after yet.
[03:40:07.474 --> 03:40:10.735]  I should probably take more pictures later when all the sodium has...
[03:40:12.150 --> 03:40:15.993]  I wanted to let everybody know this cleanse is on sale right now.
[03:40:15.993 --> 03:40:17.375]  The Liver Shield is on sale.
[03:40:17.375 --> 03:40:25.080]  The pack itself is on sale with the Advanced Liver Cleanse Pack with the Oxy Powder and the Liver Shield.
[03:40:25.080 --> 03:40:27.402]  The Oxy Powder itself is on sale.
[03:40:27.402 --> 03:40:31.065]  So go ahead to the Info Wars store and pick some up today.
[03:40:31.065 --> 03:40:32.526]  I'm telling you, this is powerful.
[03:40:32.526 --> 03:40:36.129]  I felt amazing this entire week.
[03:40:36.129 --> 03:40:38.571]  It was not as hard as I thought that it was going to be.
[03:40:41.107 --> 03:40:42.728]  Alright, there's Leanne's video.
[03:40:42.728 --> 03:40:44.929]  I'll tell you what, it's not as hard as you think it's going to be.

[03:40:52.632 --> 03:40:55.634]  Check it out, InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:40:55.634 --> 03:41:03.897]  Anyway, so back to some news, and we're going to take your calls here in a second and answer some questions coming in on Twitter, so keep those questions coming.
[03:41:03.897 --> 03:41:04.818]  On the super flare,
[03:41:05.802 --> 03:41:06.763]  What is a superflare?
[03:41:06.763 --> 03:41:10.105]  Researchers explain devastating consequences of an eruption from the sun.
[03:41:10.105 --> 03:41:20.473]  Basically, if there was a superflare from the sun, it would break down radio communication, power supplies would be destroyed and threaten the stability of our atmosphere.
[03:41:20.473 --> 03:41:22.595]  Now why am I talking about this?
[03:41:22.595 --> 03:41:29.020]  Am I talking about this to scare you that something you cannot control could happen and ruin your life and potentially kill you, most likely kill you?
[03:41:29.020 --> 03:41:29.100]  No.
[03:41:30.034 --> 03:41:37.306]  I'm talking about this to put everything into perspective, because it teaches us a valuable, valuable point.
[03:41:37.306 --> 03:41:43.035]  When we watch the media, when you go home and watch the nightly news, if that's what you watch on television,
[03:41:44.525 --> 03:41:48.647]  It's a juxtaposition from this, because there's a solar flare that could happen at any time.
[03:41:48.647 --> 03:41:55.029]  It could wipe out a large percentage of the population, but they're not constantly talking about that.
[03:41:55.029 --> 03:41:58.731]  When you go in your car and you drive down the street, you could get in an accident.
[03:41:58.731 --> 03:41:59.791]  You could die.
[03:41:59.791 --> 03:42:01.912]  They could hack your vehicles.
[03:42:01.912 --> 03:42:07.735]  You're more likely to die from the crap you're eating in the food supply than the local murderer.
[03:42:08.735 --> 03:42:14.642]  But once again, we must remember our focus is taken away and put towards whatever it is.
[03:42:14.642 --> 03:42:16.063]  If it bleeds, it leads, right?
[03:42:16.063 --> 03:42:18.326]  Whatever it is, we're focused on it.
[03:42:18.326 --> 03:42:26.315]  Even very, very tragic events where maybe five or ten people die, that's all we focus on for like a week or two weeks instead of the more realistic threats.
[03:42:26.315 --> 03:42:27.877]  So that's just a reminder that
[03:42:28.317 --> 03:42:32.920]  The narrative of the mainstream media does not necessarily correlate to any form of reality.
[03:42:32.920 --> 03:42:35.522]  We're not freaking out about solar flares all day, are we?
[03:42:35.522 --> 03:42:36.503]  That would be a horrible show.
[03:42:36.503 --> 03:42:40.646]  If I sat here for three hours and talked about solar flares, that would be terrible.
[03:42:40.646 --> 03:42:41.366]  No, no, no.
[03:42:41.366 --> 03:42:47.751]  But just remember the rabbit hole that you're sometimes sent down when you go into the mania.
[03:42:47.751 --> 03:42:49.692]  They don't tell you about the things that are actually a threat.
[03:42:49.692 --> 03:42:51.913]  Sometimes they tell you about a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.
[03:42:52.890 --> 03:42:58.753]  Anyway, so we're about to take these calls, and the question was pertaining to this article, which is very, very important.
[03:42:58.753 --> 03:43:05.856]  Because we could talk about news all day, but for 80 years, young Americans have been getting more anxious and depressed, and no one is quite sure why.
[03:43:05.856 --> 03:43:09.837]  So for 80 years, not just today's generation of young Americans.
[03:43:09.837 --> 03:43:15.240]  And then the story about how depression is more than a mental disorder, it affects the whole organism, it basically breaks you down.
[03:43:15.240 --> 03:43:18.601]  It breaks you down, it makes you sick, it makes you want to die, okay?
[03:43:18.601 --> 03:43:20.242]  And for 80 years, this has been going on.
[03:43:21.141 --> 03:43:30.116]  I asked you guys to call in and tweet me whatever and tell me why you think people have been more depressed and more beaten down than ever before.
[03:43:30.116 --> 03:43:31.518]  Tell me why.
[03:43:31.518 --> 03:43:34.523]  I'll tell you my reason and then I'll take some calls here.
[03:43:34.523 --> 03:43:35.425]  A short example.
[03:43:36.434 --> 03:43:40.877]  When you're a young kid, you have so many dreams and so many passions and ideas.
[03:43:40.877 --> 03:43:43.119]  You might want to do something crazy like be an astronaut.
[03:43:43.119 --> 03:43:46.782]  You might even want to be something impossible like Superman or something.
[03:43:46.782 --> 03:44:00.493]  But what happens is, all these beautiful ideas and the idea even of grassroots, you know, liberty and resistance and all those things that we're brought up to think that we could do, what happens is you go into the establishment meat grinder.
[03:44:00.493 --> 03:44:03.275]  And in that meat grinder, you're told that you can't do any of that.
[03:44:03.675 --> 03:44:04.796]  No, you gotta go.
[03:44:04.796 --> 03:44:05.717]  You gotta go to school.
[03:44:05.717 --> 03:44:06.698]  You gotta go to college.
[03:44:06.698 --> 03:44:08.339]  You gotta get a job.
[03:44:08.339 --> 03:44:10.661]  You gotta get a, you know, you gotta do all those things.
[03:44:10.661 --> 03:44:11.541]  You gotta go in debt.
[03:44:11.541 --> 03:44:12.542]  You gotta get that house.
[03:44:12.542 --> 03:44:14.384]  You gotta get that car payment.
[03:44:14.384 --> 03:44:16.165]  Because if you don't have that, you're not cool.
[03:44:16.165 --> 03:44:20.028]  And you better be wearing the nicest brands to support those corporations.
[03:44:20.028 --> 03:44:21.650]  You better be wearing the nicest everything.
[03:44:21.650 --> 03:44:22.770]  Nicest shoes.
[03:44:22.770 --> 03:44:24.512]  And you better be presentable.
[03:44:24.512 --> 03:44:25.773]  And you better act nice.
[03:44:25.953 --> 03:44:27.734]  And you better not offend anyone.
[03:44:27.734 --> 03:44:30.116]  Because if you offend somebody, that's really, really bad.
[03:44:30.116 --> 03:44:37.342]  So you better fit in this little box, where you're easy to control, and you're funding the corporations, and you're not thinking too big.
[03:44:37.342 --> 03:44:39.183]  Because that could be devastating.
[03:44:39.183 --> 03:44:45.488]  That could ripple the establishment fragile, fake glass around you.
[03:44:45.488 --> 03:44:49.732]  The trap, the mental trap, that you are a worthless little creature.
[03:44:49.732 --> 03:44:50.852]  And you better fit in that box.
[03:44:51.633 --> 03:45:16.481]  But what happens is, when you go in that box, because you're told that you're going to get social proof if you act cool, and if you're politically correct, and you go to the right colleges, and you wear those rings, and you go out and you get in debt, you get a house, you get a nice house for your family, you get that car you've been told is so good, you get those clothes, and by the way, I have a nice car, I have nice clothes, I like nice things, but I don't buy into this lie that it's everything, and that you're worthless without it.
[03:45:17.441 --> 03:45:19.103]  Again, this is not attacking capitalism.
[03:45:19.103 --> 03:45:24.249]  This is the establishment system turning your brain into the meat grinder, okay?
[03:45:24.249 --> 03:45:28.394]  Putting it in the meat grinder, making you think you're worthless unless you follow their system.
[03:45:28.394 --> 03:45:34.521]  But what happens at the end of the brown brick road, not the yellow brick road, the brown brick road, is you sit there and you're depressed.
[03:45:35.404 --> 03:45:40.268]  Because you grow up thinking all these amazing things are possible, and then the system tells you it's not.
[03:45:40.268 --> 03:45:41.589]  It tells you it's not possible.
[03:45:41.589 --> 03:45:43.290]  You have to go in their little system.
[03:45:43.290 --> 03:45:48.735]  You go down the whole road, you do it all, you say, I tried so hard, I thought I was gonna be happy now, but you're not happy.
[03:45:48.735 --> 03:45:51.957]  Because you were told and fed a lie, a bunch of horse BS.
[03:45:54.022 --> 03:45:54.582]  Horse BS.
[03:45:54.582 --> 03:45:55.323]  I made that up.
[03:45:55.323 --> 03:45:55.943]  Not just BS.
[03:45:55.943 --> 03:45:56.443]  Horse BS.
[03:45:56.443 --> 03:45:57.504]  That's two animals.
[03:45:57.504 --> 03:45:59.645]  So you're lied to your entire life.
[03:45:59.645 --> 03:46:01.425]  You get to the end of it and you say, I tried so hard.
[03:46:01.425 --> 03:46:02.386]  What's going on?
[03:46:02.386 --> 03:46:03.766]  Oh, you were fed a lie.
[03:46:03.766 --> 03:46:04.807]  You bought into the system.
[03:46:04.807 --> 03:46:06.168]  You bought into the establishment.
[03:46:06.168 --> 03:46:07.008]  Guess what?
[03:46:07.008 --> 03:46:08.889]  Free thinking is the way to be happy.
[03:46:08.889 --> 03:46:13.051]  Actually caring about something, standing up for something, being independent, thinking for yourself.
[03:46:13.051 --> 03:46:14.611]  That's the route to happiness.
[03:46:14.611 --> 03:46:21.655]  Not buying into the system's lie to you that you're going to be worthless unless you align with it and go down the brown brick road, the black brick road to
[03:46:22.535 --> 03:46:28.545]  Really just total mediocrity in debt and enslavement where you have 50 credit cards to keep up with it.
[03:46:28.545 --> 03:46:29.526]  And I know people like this.
[03:46:29.526 --> 03:46:31.009]  I'm not trashing you if you're like this.
[03:46:31.009 --> 03:46:33.933]  I have empathy for you and I want to bring you on to the other side.
[03:46:34.827 --> 03:46:38.608]  Okay, because this isn't just the grass is greener on this side, there's actually grass on this side.
[03:46:38.608 --> 03:46:41.228]  Over there is decaying, rotting dirt and death.
[03:46:41.228 --> 03:46:45.389]  Come over to this side of free thought and ideology, please, please do it.
[03:46:45.389 --> 03:46:48.510]  You don't have to buy into the system and be depressed.
[03:46:48.510 --> 03:46:55.571]  Young people, so-called young people, it's been for 80 years, so it's people that are actually dead now, have been depressed because of this, in my view.
[03:46:55.571 --> 03:46:58.592]  We're going to take some calls and see if they agree or if they disagree.
[03:46:58.592 --> 03:47:00.092]  That's great, I want to hear everyone's opinion.
[03:47:00.772 --> 03:47:02.833]  Let's talk to Tony in Minnesota.
[03:47:02.833 --> 03:47:05.033]  He wants to talk about his views on this.
[03:47:05.033 --> 03:47:05.694]  What's up, Tony?
[03:47:05.694 --> 03:47:07.334]  What do you think?
[03:47:07.334 --> 03:47:09.355]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[03:47:09.355 --> 03:47:21.799]  First, my background is I was governor appointed to the Minnesota Board Behavioral Health and Therapy Board, Hennepin County Children's Mental Health Council executive member there, and so I've been doing this for over 16 years.
[03:47:23.380 --> 03:47:29.667]  Um, the main thing I, the main thing, one point I wanted to make is that my son, I asked him, what do you want to be when you grow up?
[03:47:29.667 --> 03:47:32.190]  And he said, well, all the things I wanted to be, I can't be.
[03:47:32.190 --> 03:47:33.511]  And those were superheroes.
[03:47:33.511 --> 03:47:38.777]  So I told him, well, what are some transferable things you can apply to the real world?
[03:47:38.777 --> 03:47:40.318]  No, but here's the thing, Tony, Tony.
[03:47:41.437 --> 03:47:42.839]  I think he could be a superhero, okay?
[03:47:42.839 --> 03:47:49.007]  He doesn't have to be Superman with bulletproof ribcage and laser vision and stuff.
[03:47:49.007 --> 03:47:49.968]  But what is a superhero?
[03:47:49.968 --> 03:47:50.749]  It's above a hero.
[03:47:50.749 --> 03:47:51.269]  What is a hero?
[03:47:51.269 --> 03:47:53.112]  Someone that helps someone, someone that saves people.
[03:47:53.112 --> 03:47:56.436]  To me, there's a million superheroes in the world, and I'm not being cheesy.
[03:47:56.656 --> 03:47:58.677]  This isn't some cheesy stuff, okay?
[03:47:58.677 --> 03:47:59.578]  This is the real deal.
[03:47:59.578 --> 03:48:00.859]  There's a million superheroes in the world.
[03:48:00.859 --> 03:48:02.159]  There's people who actually do good.
[03:48:02.159 --> 03:48:03.340]  There's heroes everywhere.
[03:48:03.340 --> 03:48:04.161]  You know what I mean?
[03:48:04.161 --> 03:48:05.101]  I love the idea.
[03:48:05.101 --> 03:48:06.262]  I used to want to be Superman.
[03:48:06.262 --> 03:48:07.423]  That's what I wanted to be.
[03:48:07.423 --> 03:48:11.685]  The idea of Superman going out and helping people and actually doing something, that is totally transferable.
[03:48:11.685 --> 03:48:14.387]  I get where you're going with this, but it's totally transferable.
[03:48:15.749 --> 03:48:35.748]  Okay, and the other point I wanted to make was a lot of it is about coping mechanisms, but now with my daughter, the schools have got this gender confusion going on where they're programming the kids, and so now the guidance counselor put her on a gender reassignment list without her knowledge or consent.
[03:48:35.748 --> 03:48:40.653]  She put your kid on a gender reassignment list without your knowledge or consent?
[03:48:41.420 --> 03:48:53.023]  Yes, and the problem is that we already had her in therapy because we were explaining to her that, you know, once you do this you'll no longer have orgasms and your lymph system will no longer be working properly and that's where cancer lives.
[03:48:53.023 --> 03:48:54.423]  So we're dealing with that.
[03:48:54.423 --> 03:48:56.243]  How old is your child?
[03:48:56.243 --> 03:48:57.944]  Where is this happening?
[03:48:57.944 --> 03:49:01.225]  This is in Minnesota and I don't want to mention anything.
[03:49:01.225 --> 03:49:02.385]  No, I don't want the names or anything.
[03:49:02.385 --> 03:49:04.085]  I just meant, okay, it's in Minnesota.
[03:49:04.085 --> 03:49:04.885]  How old is your child?
[03:49:04.885 --> 03:49:06.366]  I don't want any personal details, please.
[03:49:07.708 --> 03:49:08.188]  I think so.
[03:49:26.033 --> 03:49:48.623]  Possibly, what do you call that, sterilization tactics, like creating modern day eunuchs in this fashion just for the industrial complex's recidivism, because the studies show that more kids after the reassignment are suicidal, and 60% of them want to have it reversed, but to find out that they can't, they commit suicide after that.
[03:49:48.903 --> 03:49:53.325]  Well, I have no idea what's going on with your situation, but that, yeah, it's very sad.
[03:49:53.325 --> 03:50:00.207]  A lot of people that ultimately want to kill themselves for whatever reason, but that sounds, yeah, a lot of crazy stuff going on.
[03:50:00.207 --> 03:50:06.189]  Well, thank you so much for your call, Tony, and let's go ahead and go to a few more here, get to as many as we can.
[03:50:06.189 --> 03:50:08.550]  Let's talk to Shane in Carolina, North Carolina.
[03:50:08.550 --> 03:50:09.570]  He wants to comment on it.
[03:50:09.570 --> 03:50:12.972]  Why do you think people are so upset and depressed?
[03:50:12.972 --> 03:50:16.833]  Well, there's various reasons, but in that article, you see that the
[03:50:17.535 --> 03:50:32.942]  They claim that nobody knows why, which I think is the most absolutely ridiculous thing I've ever heard, because it's pretty obvious why, and there are lots of reasons, including everything that you said in your opening dialogue on the topic.
[03:50:32.942 --> 03:50:36.163]  I completely concur with everything that you said.
[03:50:36.163 --> 03:50:37.904]  Quick comment on that last caller.
[03:50:37.904 --> 03:50:41.606]  Wow, if someone was doing that to my kid, I think it's time to pull them out of
[03:50:44.141 --> 03:50:49.265]  Definitely.
[03:50:49.265 --> 03:50:50.546]  Hey, we're about to jump to break.
[03:50:50.546 --> 03:50:52.127]  That does sound totally outrageous.
[03:50:52.127 --> 03:50:54.229]  Definitely have to look into that one.
[03:50:54.229 --> 03:50:55.851]  But we'll be right back with another segment.
[03:50:55.851 --> 03:50:57.452]  We'll take some more calls and cover some more news.
[03:50:57.452 --> 03:50:59.494]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:50:59.494 --> 03:51:00.314]  Thanks for watching.
[03:51:00.314 --> 03:51:06.480]  Do you or someone you know suffer from chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, or irregular heartbeat?
[03:51:07.160 --> 03:51:11.561]  Are you looking for a more natural solution to overcome these health challenges?
[03:51:11.561 --> 03:51:13.522]  You hear the ads all the time.
[03:51:13.522 --> 03:51:17.083]  If this stuff's so good, why doesn't my doctor prescribe it?
[03:51:17.083 --> 03:51:17.923]  That's easy.
[03:51:17.923 --> 03:51:20.364]  There's more money in treating symptoms.

[03:54:11.372 --> 03:54:12.132]  It's been a good show.
[03:54:12.132 --> 03:54:15.596]  It's been definitely a lot of interesting stuff talked about today.
[03:54:15.596 --> 03:54:25.666]  We're going to take as many more calls as we possibly can, and if callers are listening, I want to go through you guys, and we have to keep it under a minute, even 30 seconds, if you could just state your point.
[03:54:25.666 --> 03:54:27.428]  That would be awesome, so we could get some more in.
[03:54:27.428 --> 03:54:28.849]  I'm going to blitz through some news here.
[03:54:29.870 --> 03:54:34.033]  And I also want to remember you to go to Infowarslife.com and get the Ultimate Cleanse Pack.

[03:54:39.597 --> 03:54:40.078]  Do it.
[03:54:40.078 --> 03:54:42.199]  It'll actually make a difference in your life.
[03:54:42.199 --> 03:54:46.382]  Alright, so people with rage disorder twice as likely to have toxoplasmosis.
[03:54:46.382 --> 03:54:48.704]  So you've heard about crazy cat ladies, right?
[03:54:48.704 --> 03:54:50.465]  Crazy cat people.
[03:54:50.465 --> 03:54:58.191]  People with tons of cats, there's always been this kind of, I guess you could call it some type of a superstition or whatever, that they're crazier than normal people.
[03:54:58.951 --> 03:55:10.635]  Well, toxoplasmosis is basically a parasite that has been linked with cat feces, and I've been reading and talking about this for years, but now I think most people are finally starting to understand it's real.
[03:55:10.635 --> 03:55:23.940]  I remember being with Alex, actually, hanging out, talking to some people about toxoplasmosis, saying, you realize that cats that go outside can get toxoplasmosis, which is a parasite, and they go to the bathroom, and you clean their litter, and your face is right there cleaning it.
[03:55:24.400 --> 03:55:24.560]  You're
[03:55:41.863 --> 03:55:42.524]  Let's see what it is.
[03:55:42.524 --> 03:55:42.884]  Exactly.
[03:55:42.884 --> 03:55:50.793]  It's been linked to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, suicidal behavior, and now people with rage disorder are twice as likely to have it.
[03:55:50.793 --> 03:55:52.835]  So, very interesting stuff.
[03:55:52.835 --> 03:55:53.636]  Something to consider.
[03:55:53.636 --> 03:55:55.378]  A little bit of ridiculous news.
[03:55:55.378 --> 03:55:58.041]  I always have a little stack of ridiculous news.
[03:55:58.041 --> 03:56:02.166]  TMZ sued for naming wrong rapper who cut off his penis.
[03:56:02.166 --> 03:56:03.046]  And that reminded me...
[03:56:04.574 --> 03:56:14.118]  of jurors in Hulk Hogan vs. Gawker trial say they made absolutely correct decision awarding Hogan $140 million for posting his sex tape and just commenting on him and stuff.
[03:56:14.118 --> 03:56:17.719]  And it's interesting to note that, in fact, we should probably pull up a picture.
[03:56:17.719 --> 03:56:22.161]  If you just look up Hulk Hogan court do-rag, he went into court, okay?
[03:56:22.161 --> 03:56:29.303]  He went into, I guess it was a federal court, and wore a do-rag and still won $140 million.
[03:56:29.303 --> 03:56:30.564]  That's when you know you have a strong case.
[03:56:31.801 --> 03:56:41.126]  So, anyway, Saudi Prince sued by owner of notorious Hollywood Hills party mansion who claims to trash $100,000 a month rental pad with wild cocaine and stripper-fueled parties.
[03:56:41.126 --> 03:56:42.967]  Sounds very Christian.
[03:56:42.967 --> 03:56:46.889]  Texas, women furious after home mistakenly demolished.
[03:56:46.889 --> 03:56:47.710]  That's helpful.
[03:56:47.710 --> 03:56:52.472]  New study claims people with higher IQs don't require large social circles.
[03:56:52.472 --> 03:56:54.153]  Alright, now we're going to try and blitz through these calls.
[03:56:54.153 --> 03:56:55.434]  Last thoughts and comments.
[03:56:55.434 --> 03:56:57.055]  We're going to go to Fred in Pennsylvania.
[03:56:57.055 --> 03:56:59.356]  Why do you think people are so upset with the state of the world?
[03:57:01.826 --> 03:57:13.307]  Yeah, I was going to be a caller on your program, but this is absolutely the worst hour, the most disjointed, pointless, hyperactive,
[03:57:14.213 --> 03:57:18.256]  Uh, brain damaged hour that I've ever heard on Alex Jones.
[03:57:18.256 --> 03:57:20.977]  And that's saying a lot because I've been listening since 2000.
[03:57:20.977 --> 03:57:22.118]  Well, thank you very much.
[03:57:22.118 --> 03:57:26.060]  I appreciate the, uh, the compliment that it's a very hyperactive hour.
[03:57:26.060 --> 03:57:33.825]  Um, yes, we've talked about a number of discussions, perhaps a little intellectual discussion as well, talking about more than one or two pieces of news.
[03:57:33.825 --> 03:57:34.745]  I know it's a little crazy.
[03:57:34.745 --> 03:57:35.826]  It's a little high speed, right?
[03:57:35.826 --> 03:57:38.367]  It's a little bit too much sometimes for some people.
[03:57:38.367 --> 03:57:38.848]  Um, even
[03:57:39.628 --> 03:57:50.461]  Even talking about something that goes beyond maybe NFL or the Super Bowl or Kim Kardashian or even just what the other news people are talking about.
[03:57:50.461 --> 03:57:53.745]  We have to continually hit on one point for the whole show.
[03:57:53.745 --> 03:57:54.486]  You're right.
[03:57:54.486 --> 03:57:57.490]  I apologize that it's a little bit too fast for you.
[03:57:57.890 --> 03:57:59.190]  Anyway, thanks for watching, everyone.
[03:57:59.190 --> 03:58:02.412]  Sorry we couldn't get to the rest of the calls, and there is also more news.
[03:58:02.412 --> 03:58:05.693]  But Alex will be back from tomorrow, 11 to 2 p.m.
[03:58:05.693 --> 03:58:07.914]  Central, and then 2 to 3 for the 4th Hour.
[03:58:07.914 --> 03:58:08.814]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:58:08.814 --> 03:58:12.335]  Thanks so much for watching the fast-paced 4th Hour of the Alex Jones Show.
