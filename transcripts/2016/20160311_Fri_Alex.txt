[00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:15.723]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.404 --> 00:00:17.444]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:19.265]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.946 --> 00:00:20.726]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.507 --> 00:00:22.387]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.068 --> 00:00:26.650]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.312]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.744 --> 00:00:42.686]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here on this Friday, March 11th, 2016 Global Transmission.
[00:00:42.986 --> 00:00:44.207]  Now, I'm not live right now.
[00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:45.107]  I'm taping this in the morning.
[00:00:45.427 --> 00:00:56.092]  But I will be, by the grace of God, live at 1130 Central Standard Time for the balance of the transmission, which runs 11am to 3pm Central Standard Time.
[00:00:56.172 --> 00:01:00.653]  And of course, Nightly News coming up this evening, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWarsNews.com.
[00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:01.814]  And of course, I'll be back
[00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:06.315]  This is an amazing, interesting, over-the-top, epic, legendary time to be alive.
[00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:32.138]  DrugsReport.com has a big poll with hundreds of thousands voting.
[00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.104]  Sixty-five percent, as of time of taping, are going for him against the other three candidates.
[00:01:39.144 --> 00:01:40.906]  Just absolutely dwarfing them.
[00:01:41.527 --> 00:01:43.108]  And he's winning most of the states.
[00:01:43.288 --> 00:01:44.890]  The problem is they're not winner-take-all.
[00:01:46.195 --> 00:01:57.103]  And now the Republican Party is openly, all over the news, denying it three weeks ago when Roger Stone talked about it, denying it six months ago when our guests talked about it, and Richard Reeves and others did, saying we were crazy in the news.
[00:01:57.523 --> 00:02:00.205]  Now they're going, yes of course we're going to try to broker it and take it away.
[00:02:00.985 --> 00:02:03.267]  So they're mainlining that.
[00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:13.554]  Meanwhile, I'm going to play this clip coming up, Obama mocks Cruz at state dinner, says where else could a boy born in Calgary run for President of the United States?
[00:02:13.854 --> 00:02:14.455]  Another birther!
[00:02:15.987 --> 00:02:16.767]  Here's the issue.
[00:02:16.787 --> 00:02:22.971]  If he's a strict constructionist for the Constitution, then you can't have Ted Cruz.
[00:02:22.991 --> 00:02:23.891]  He's not natural born.
[00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:30.235]  That said, they go, well, we have a precedent with Obama and his providence being questioned, so it must be okay.
[00:02:31.926 --> 00:02:34.928]  Well, no, ladies and gentlemen, it's not okay.
[00:02:35.668 --> 00:02:37.829]  And it's all part of just eroding the Constitution.
[00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.792]  There's also another video that Drudge has and InfoWars has.
[00:02:42.692 --> 00:02:50.417]  I noticed the site that had it's crashing, but we've got the video and the article of Ted Cruz's dad, you know, laying on hands.
[00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:53.358]  I'm talking about Ted being the anointed one, talking in tongues.
[00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:55.400]  The media is making fun of us.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.662]  I don't make fun of Christians or other religious groups.
[00:02:58.822 --> 00:03:00.443]  I myself am a Christian.
[00:03:01.962 --> 00:03:05.665]  And I think it's insulting at certain levels to make fun of all this.
[00:03:06.265 --> 00:03:08.867]  At the same time, though, the question is, is he being sincere?
[00:03:09.928 --> 00:03:10.908]  Is he being sincere?
[00:03:10.968 --> 00:03:27.719]  Because, you know, he's this big Bush TPP architect, and his wife's hooked him with a top globalist, and then now the Bushes are backing him in his financing for the campaign, and he's got Glenn Beck, excuse me, Benedict Arnold, Glenn Beck's his name, sitting there backing him as well.
[00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:29.901]  There's quite a constellation, quite a
[00:03:31.272 --> 00:03:33.434]  Grouping of concerns around him.
[00:03:34.074 --> 00:03:39.079]  By contrast, watching Trump last night, when they would go, hey, you bring in some foreign workers.
[00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.899]  He goes, yeah, legally.
[00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:45.564]  And you get some stuff made, a lot of your clothing lines made in Latin America.
[00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:48.627]  And Trump went, yeah, I told you.
[00:03:49.267 --> 00:03:50.408]  It's not a fair system.
[00:03:50.508 --> 00:03:51.289]  I'm a businessman.
[00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.050]  I have to compete within that system.
[00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:59.316]  And so I'm trying to change it and make it fair so that we can produce things here in America.
[00:04:00.248 --> 00:04:01.249]  That's absolutely right.
[00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:02.490]  He's saying it's a fraud.
[00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:03.451]  It's a scam.
[00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:06.274]  Listen, and it's Americans' choices as well.
[00:04:06.394 --> 00:04:09.617]  We sell made-in-Latin-America clothing.
[00:04:09.657 --> 00:04:11.699]  I try not to get it from China because people are so exploited.
[00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.423]  We sell a bunch of stuff made in Nicaragua and places like that that's high quality.
[00:04:17.304 --> 00:04:20.366]  And we can get those shirts for three or four dollars apiece.
[00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:22.119]  And then sell them for $15.
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.021]  And people want to buy what's cheaper.
[00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:25.722]  And then be able to fund our operation.
[00:04:26.382 --> 00:04:34.347]  When I get stuff made in America, because of the regulations and all the internal tariffs and the garbage, the same shirt costs $9 to $12.
[00:04:34.768 --> 00:04:38.930]  Designer shirts we try to get made here cost $25.
[00:04:42.807 --> 00:04:44.709]  Then we got to sell them for like $30 or $40 to make any money.
[00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:50.874]  So we sell the made in America, and then right next to it we sell the other stuff, and people buy the less expensive.
[00:04:51.334 --> 00:04:51.795]  That's a fact.
[00:04:51.815 --> 00:04:52.495]  So we'll have to compete.
[00:04:52.535 --> 00:04:53.236]  I give you the choice.
[00:04:53.776 --> 00:04:54.237]  Trump's right.
[00:04:54.257 --> 00:04:57.219]  We're going to break all this down and a ton more straight ahead.
[00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.480]  Obama's coming to Austin today.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.042]  We're going to be covering that too.
[00:05:00.442 --> 00:05:01.163]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.164 --> 00:05:04.345]  This is the Worldwide Friday Edition.
[00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:04.786]  Stay with us.
[00:05:09.045 --> 00:05:10.486]  Where do you go to leave your legacy?
[00:05:10.626 --> 00:05:13.767]  Well, if you're President Barack Obama, you go to South by Southwest.
[00:05:14.067 --> 00:05:14.547]  That's right.
[00:05:14.707 --> 00:05:23.490]  In addition to the 200,000 workers and guests and attendees who will be filling up the Austin downtown area, Barack Obama is going to show up with his giant Secret Service detail.
[00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:33.514]  Of course, in addition to tying up traffic, as Kit Daniels covered, even the Mayor of Austin is warning people to stay home on Friday as the President's visit is sure to tie up traffic for hours on end.
[00:05:33.754 --> 00:05:37.255]  He will also be utilizing state police and local police resources.
[00:05:37.435 --> 00:05:39.316]  Which could be used during South by Southwest.
[00:05:39.516 --> 00:05:40.796]  He'll be making two stops.
[00:05:41.076 --> 00:05:43.497]  One at the Long Center for Performing Arts to give a speech.
[00:05:43.737 --> 00:05:47.158]  And then jumping across the river to attend a fundraiser at Austin Music Hall.
[00:05:47.358 --> 00:05:52.299]  And then it's on to a private fundraiser at the home of Amy and Kirk Rudy, local developers here.
[00:05:52.519 --> 00:06:02.082]  It was Amy Rudy who approached a local Austin City Council member after he voted against awarding a $37 million tax rebate to her husband's company and said, don't F with my husband.
[00:06:02.222 --> 00:06:03.222]  And she repeated it twice.
[00:06:03.422 --> 00:06:05.442]  These are the kind of people Obama hangs out with.
[00:06:05.462 --> 00:06:08.263]  Rob Drew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:06:08.843 --> 00:06:09.283]  Hey, everyone.
[00:06:09.643 --> 00:06:11.904]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[00:06:11.944 --> 00:06:15.504]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:17.385]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:06:17.865 --> 00:06:27.727]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:06:28.127 --> 00:06:34.151]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:06:34.591 --> 00:06:49.001]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats,
[00:06:49.181 --> 00:06:49.581]  I think so.
[00:07:15.572 --> 00:07:18.655]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[00:07:18.675 --> 00:07:22.518]  I needed to get my digestive system working correctly again.
[00:07:22.598 --> 00:07:24.400]  So I stumbled on the X2.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.161]  I needed a detox basically.
[00:07:39.313 --> 00:07:42.775]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[00:07:42.976 --> 00:07:44.016]  What do you have to lose?
[00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:52.863]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[00:07:53.328 --> 00:07:56.971]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[00:07:56.991 --> 00:07:58.672]  I was like really more natural.
[00:07:58.952 --> 00:08:03.976]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:08:11.035 --> 00:08:13.677]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today.
[00:08:13.737 --> 00:08:19.441]  This is the live, global, Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:19.801 --> 00:08:21.462]  We're gonna be going all the way to three o'clock today.
[00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:27.886]  Now, I'm taping in the morning right now, but coming up in about 15, 20 minutes, I will be live in studio.
[00:08:28.587 --> 00:08:32.349]  We've got Obama coming to town today for South by Southwest here in Austin, Texas.
[00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:36.692]  We're gonna have coverage of the mindless throngs of worshipers.
[00:08:37.753 --> 00:08:40.715]  They're smaller throngs, but they're out there, and we're gonna be looking
[00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:42.396]  We're good to go.
[00:09:03.402 --> 00:09:04.983]  Attacking him as viciously as they can.
[00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:13.989]  And also he's again at about 65% as we take this at the big drudge poll right now with tons of folks voting on that.
[00:09:14.009 --> 00:09:17.452]  We also have our own polls at InfoWars.com showing similar numbers.
[00:09:17.832 --> 00:09:20.374]  Here's a Kit Daniels article on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:20.954 --> 00:09:21.855]  Mass exodus.
[00:09:22.275 --> 00:09:25.037]  Thousands of lifelong Democrats jumped to Trump.
[00:09:25.457 --> 00:09:26.398]  Thousands of Democrats.
[00:09:26.418 --> 00:09:27.118]  It's going to be millions.
[00:09:27.479 --> 00:09:29.160]  Also propelled Reagan of the White House.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:36.124]  Trump in some states has hundreds of thousands of extra people voting in the Republican primary, not seen since Reagan.
[00:09:36.584 --> 00:09:38.505]  And these are, these are Reagan Democrats.
[00:09:39.266 --> 00:09:43.809]  These are people that are socially liberal in some ways, but you know, they understand the country's being shut down.
[00:09:44.309 --> 00:09:48.552]  Cutting taxes on middle class and poor people like Kennedy did and Reagan did is the way to go.
[00:09:49.452 --> 00:09:52.715]  So that's a very, very important article up on Infowars.com.
[00:09:53.596 --> 00:10:07.828]  Also, there is this sickening, sickening, sickening story where Obama has come out in a speech, we're going to play a clip of in a moment, and said that he hasn't divided anybody in America.
[00:10:08.388 --> 00:10:11.451]  I mean, you think about the nerve of that to say that
[00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:16.132]  He hasn't divided anybody in this country.
[00:10:16.172 --> 00:10:17.213]  In fact, here's the actual quote.
[00:10:17.673 --> 00:10:20.594]  Obama, I certainly have not contributed to dividing the country.
[00:10:21.114 --> 00:10:34.478]  He has had his proxies from Al Sharpton to all the financing of George Soros on record funding groups that go out and say deck the halls with dead cops and going out and saying we're going to federalize the police.
[00:10:36.554 --> 00:10:37.895]  By causing these crises.
[00:10:37.915 --> 00:10:40.617]  He's been caught funding the Trayvon Martin protesters.
[00:10:41.017 --> 00:10:42.978]  He's been caught because he's double black unemployment.
[00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:48.822]  So they want to change the subject how the Democrats are screwing black people and everybody else over to get us all fighting with each other.
[00:10:48.862 --> 00:10:50.283]  Classic divide and conquer.
[00:10:50.303 --> 00:10:51.124]  So this is like saying
[00:10:52.409 --> 00:11:07.674]  If you have a business you didn't build that, or saying two plus two doesn't equal four, this is another one of the humongoid, gigantor, colossal, redonkulous pieces of garbage that has been spewed at us.
[00:11:07.794 --> 00:11:16.257]  Obama, I certainly have not contributed to dividing the country when he has become the divider in chief and the big foundations have spent
[00:11:16.997 --> 00:11:24.964]  Hundreds of millions of dollars trying to foment racial strife and unrest, and the Super Bowl has endorsed it, and Hollywood is pumping it.
[00:11:25.224 --> 00:11:27.045]  You can see the message.
[00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:31.869]  In fact, there's more race war garbage being put out than there is anti-family, anti-male garbage.
[00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:33.350]  Let's get it straight.
[00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:39.375]  Whether you're black, white, a human, got red blood, they are trying to divide and screw everybody over.
[00:11:40.156 --> 00:11:44.559]  They are, look, they're attacking men in every sitcom and every drama and every movie you see.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.401]  Stupid, weak role models.
[00:11:48.087 --> 00:11:49.287]  Men, we're under attack.
[00:11:49.327 --> 00:11:51.508]  And women, you're under attack trying to take men from you.
[00:11:52.468 --> 00:11:54.248]  Come on, let's just come together for humanity.
[00:11:55.109 --> 00:11:59.090]  They're attacking seeds that produce good seeds.
[00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.290]  They're killing the life process of the earth.
[00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:02.970]  To have a monopoly over life.
[00:12:03.511 --> 00:12:06.391]  To make you so sick, you gotta have all their high-tech medicines to live.
[00:12:07.651 --> 00:12:10.552]  You gotta go to them to buy seeds that'll even reproduce again.
[00:12:10.572 --> 00:12:14.253]  And are based on toxic chemicals.
[00:12:15.845 --> 00:12:16.826]  This is crazy, folks.
[00:12:16.886 --> 00:12:17.907]  It's their philosophy.
[00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:18.567]  It's evil.
[00:12:18.627 --> 00:12:19.308]  It's alien.
[00:12:19.348 --> 00:12:20.529]  It's like none of this world.
[00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.291]  But it's the God of this world.
[00:12:25.312 --> 00:12:27.034]  Fallen to this world to rule us.
[00:12:27.094 --> 00:12:27.554]  Read the Bible.
[00:12:27.594 --> 00:12:28.395]  It's all in plain view.
[00:12:28.755 --> 00:12:30.016]  The big secret right in front of you.
[00:12:30.737 --> 00:12:31.597]  Use your brain, folks.
[00:12:32.999 --> 00:12:35.440]  They're creating artificial intelligence, none of this world.
[00:12:35.761 --> 00:12:38.363]  Artificial animals and chimera creatures, none of this world.
[00:12:39.755 --> 00:12:42.836]  I talk to top CEOs, people worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:12:43.036 --> 00:12:43.856]  They don't even know about this.
[00:12:43.916 --> 00:12:48.758]  I pull up MIT about chimera-chest-dating humans all over the U.S., and they go, my God, you're kidding.
[00:12:48.778 --> 00:12:50.179]  I thought that's the X-Files.
[00:12:50.539 --> 00:12:54.260]  See, they show you fantasy so that when it's right in front of you in reality, you don't know it.
[00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:59.182]  These are aliens they're creating inside these cows and pigs and sheep.
[00:13:00.002 --> 00:13:02.643]  You're like, the aliens aren't coming from a distant planet.
[00:13:02.903 --> 00:13:07.445]  The elite are creating their own creation by twisting life forms.
[00:13:08.809 --> 00:13:10.010]  I'm sorry, how long do I have in this segment?
[00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.450]  I'm ranting.
[00:13:12.051 --> 00:13:12.692]  All right, how many?
[00:13:13.252 --> 00:13:17.515]  Okay, so let's go ahead and play this clip of Obama.
[00:13:17.616 --> 00:13:19.557]  I certainly have not contributed to dividing the country.
[00:13:19.737 --> 00:13:20.117]  Here it is.
[00:13:21.799 --> 00:13:36.970]  A notion that everything I do is to be opposed, that cooperation or compromise somehow is a betrayal.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:14:03.872]  that maximalist absolutist positions on issues are politically advantageous that there is a them out there and an us and them are the folks who are causing whatever problems you're experiencing and
[00:14:06.239 --> 00:14:21.589]  The tone of that politics, which I certainly have not contributed to, I don't think that I was the one to prompt questions about my birth certificate, for example.
[00:14:21.649 --> 00:14:27.133]  I don't remember saying, hey, why don't you ask me about that?
[00:14:30.875 --> 00:14:32.456]  Why don't you question
[00:14:34.404 --> 00:14:40.990]  Whether I'm American, or whether I'm loyal, or whether I have America's best interests at heart.
[00:14:42.991 --> 00:14:45.573]  Those aren't things that were prompted by any actions of mine.
[00:14:46.274 --> 00:14:47.915]  Alright, now, there it is.
[00:14:47.975 --> 00:14:52.559]  Just another over-the-top statement that anyone paying attention knows has not been going on.
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:54.461]  Here's what I want to say.
[00:14:54.481 --> 00:14:56.462]  I'll talk more about this when I come on live.
[00:14:57.182 --> 00:14:59.724]  Obama is here in town at South by Southwest.
[00:15:00.144 --> 00:15:05.068]  It's the biggest conference now probably in the world for multimedia, film, and music.
[00:15:05.648 --> 00:15:15.915]  It started 30-something years ago here in Austin by the guy that owns the Austin Chronicle that is literally the biggest rag on the planet of disinformation and just pushes pure globalist agenda.
[00:15:15.995 --> 00:15:17.376]  I mean, it is a joke, okay?
[00:15:17.616 --> 00:15:20.118]  The guy has been after me since I got on air.
[00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.319]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:23.400]  Unbelievable.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.482]  Uh, the things they've done to try to shut us down and kick us off the air.
[00:15:26.862 --> 00:15:33.087]  These people are just like the Attorney General that says, yeah, we're talking to the FBI about arresting climate deniers.
[00:15:33.687 --> 00:15:33.907]  Okay?
[00:15:34.207 --> 00:15:35.128]  These people mean business.
[00:15:35.588 --> 00:15:36.909]  I don't care if they dress like beatniks.
[00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:38.130]  They are predators.
[00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:39.191]  They are parasites.
[00:15:40.011 --> 00:15:41.032]  They have all these dreams.
[00:15:41.112 --> 00:15:47.817]  Hollywood is about stealing dreams, getting your young daughter who's the beauty queen to go out there thinking she's going to be a movie star, and she ends up being a prostitute.
[00:15:49.025 --> 00:15:50.186]  It's about sucking your dreams.
[00:15:50.927 --> 00:15:53.348]  And they advertise all these wannabe musicians.
[00:15:53.529 --> 00:15:58.072]  The first bug zapper they put up was that you come to Austin to be a musician.
[00:15:58.633 --> 00:16:05.178]  And then all of these musicians attending other musicians' events, all desperately trying to make it with scam record deals, ripping them off.
[00:16:05.258 --> 00:16:07.860]  Okay, I've lived here 26, 27 years.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.841]  I've seen the town.
[00:16:09.942 --> 00:16:10.562]  I know the scene.
[00:16:10.862 --> 00:16:11.503]  It's delusional.
[00:16:11.843 --> 00:16:15.006]  Everybody that wants to be a big star, you know, comes here to get ripped off.
[00:16:16.004 --> 00:16:18.226]  He got some computer companies here, some multimedia.
[00:16:18.847 --> 00:16:25.833]  And most of these companies have half their staff working for free, even though they have PhDs and degrees and engineering degrees, to try to make money to try to make it.
[00:16:26.053 --> 00:16:28.776]  Like most of the women in porn now, you know, don't even get paid.
[00:16:29.376 --> 00:16:29.636]  Okay?
[00:16:30.077 --> 00:16:30.898]  So it's the same deal.
[00:16:31.798 --> 00:16:36.703]  Most people I know that work at Discovery Channel, that were making 200 grand a year as top camera people, don't even get paid basically anything anymore.
[00:16:37.728 --> 00:16:39.749]  Okay, I mean, this is how the scam works, okay?
[00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:52.277]  And it's all because they get this big glut in here, you pay thousands of dollars, thousands of dollars to be able to even get into some of the events, and you go hear some globalist spew at you from Google or Apple and now Obama.
[00:16:52.477 --> 00:17:01.042]  And it's just perfect how he sold all these fake dreams and all this fake hope, and he's all over movies and TV and drama, because he doesn't even target the news audience that's somewhat informed now.
[00:17:01.282 --> 00:17:05.565]  They target yuppies and trendies that follow every rule, every political correct,
[00:17:05.985 --> 00:17:07.606]  You know, religious mantra.
[00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:12.070]  They do what they're told in belief that they'll be accepted into the system and they're not.
[00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:13.851]  And it's like zombies.
[00:17:13.872 --> 00:17:14.832]  We're going to show footage of this.
[00:17:15.113 --> 00:17:23.800]  Just all these shuffling, poor, pathetic people looking for a dream, mortgaging their houses, doing everything to come to Austin to put on parties, try to meet people.
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.462]  And there's all these vampires involved.
[00:17:26.582 --> 00:17:34.188]  Louis Black of the Chronicles at the top of it, sitting there managing all the dreams, all the people that want to be involved.
[00:17:34.228 --> 00:17:35.149]  And then they do things like
[00:17:36.186 --> 00:17:36.927]  This is all over the news.
[00:17:37.507 --> 00:17:44.592]  If someone tries to have a rock band play in a parking lot of a grocery store, they have mafias show up and threaten them that you're going to be shut down.
[00:17:45.532 --> 00:17:46.933]  You'll never play in this town again.
[00:17:46.953 --> 00:17:50.196]  You can't piggyback on South by Southwest.
[00:17:50.576 --> 00:17:51.496]  They tried to stop us.
[00:17:51.536 --> 00:17:52.757]  We can play a clip later of this.
[00:17:53.097 --> 00:17:55.479]  Three years ago, handing out free copies of the magazine.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.783]  And the police came and said, we've been ordered by the city to do this when the cops come, but I'm not going to follow the orders.
[00:18:01.343 --> 00:18:01.643]  You're right.
[00:18:01.663 --> 00:18:02.304]  You have a First Amendment.
[00:18:03.184 --> 00:18:04.005]  And they shook our hands.
[00:18:04.845 --> 00:18:05.226]  On video.
[00:18:06.337 --> 00:18:06.777]  On video.
[00:18:07.598 --> 00:18:09.579]  Not once, but twice over two different days.
[00:18:10.039 --> 00:18:11.660]  Then they sent code enforcers out and threatened us.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.881]  And I said, you know, you don't have jurisdiction.
[00:18:13.901 --> 00:18:14.921]  I'm not a hot dog stand.
[00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:15.822]  I'm not running commerce.
[00:18:15.862 --> 00:18:17.463]  I'm giving out free speech information.
[00:18:17.843 --> 00:18:18.563]  I said, you go ahead.
[00:18:18.783 --> 00:18:20.024]  They go tell the cops to arrest us.
[00:18:20.604 --> 00:18:21.425]  Cops wouldn't do it.
[00:18:22.625 --> 00:18:23.866]  We ought to re-air that later on the show.
[00:18:23.886 --> 00:18:25.026]  Dig those videos up.
[00:18:25.567 --> 00:18:27.308]  So this is what we're dealing with.
[00:18:27.668 --> 00:18:28.848]  And that's why it's so evil.
[00:18:29.349 --> 00:18:31.690]  And these people know they're predators, okay?
[00:18:32.679 --> 00:18:34.100]  They know what they're doing.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.321]  They understand.
[00:18:35.361 --> 00:18:40.704]  And by the way, that magazine was specifically criticizing South by Southwest and these dream catcher frauds.
[00:18:41.045 --> 00:18:41.305]  Okay?
[00:18:41.605 --> 00:18:42.265]  You want to dream?
[00:18:42.646 --> 00:18:43.686]  Play music because you love it.
[00:18:43.987 --> 00:18:44.547]  You want to dream?
[00:18:44.567 --> 00:18:48.510]  Go out in the middle of the countryside somewhere and play for old farmers or something.
[00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:49.190]  That's the magic.
[00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.351]  Suddenly it'll get picked up in the underground and be loved.
[00:18:51.592 --> 00:18:52.973]  Go put it on YouTube yourself.
[00:18:53.233 --> 00:18:55.614]  Do it not because you want to be a star, but because you love it.
[00:18:55.935 --> 00:18:57.115]  Make films because you love it.
[00:18:57.416 --> 00:18:58.696]  Write poetry because you love it.
[00:18:58.877 --> 00:18:59.737]  And you'll be fulfilled.
[00:18:59.757 --> 00:19:02.359]  And then the money will come, if that's really what you're seeking.
[00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:06.304]  All these people like, like, like bugs into a bug zapper, like moths to a flame.
[00:19:06.665 --> 00:19:11.852]  I just watch them shuffling around and then by the end of the two weeks, they're so desperate.
[00:19:12.192 --> 00:19:12.993]  They've blown everything.
[00:19:13.033 --> 00:19:14.355]  I mean, at first you see them kind of excited.
[00:19:14.395 --> 00:19:18.000]  The first few days by the end, if I don't want to show this, the progress by the end, they're just.
[00:19:20.845 --> 00:19:22.025]  It's the feeling of L.A.
[00:19:22.065 --> 00:19:23.846]  and I feel Austin being killed.
[00:19:24.446 --> 00:19:30.467]  I feel Austin, you know, literally founded by my ancestors and Buckley's ancestors and all the rest of it.
[00:19:30.667 --> 00:19:31.768]  He used to have this great soul.
[00:19:31.848 --> 00:19:32.908]  It's becoming L.A.
[00:19:33.188 --> 00:19:33.948]  and it becomes L.A.
[00:19:33.988 --> 00:19:34.628]  for two weeks.
[00:19:35.108 --> 00:19:37.489]  And quite frankly, we're talking about the future leaving when it's here.
[00:19:37.689 --> 00:19:40.690]  But we're going to return with the torch of liberty and expose the vampires.
[00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.871]  We're going to expose the whole stinking system and it's coming up.
[00:19:45.231 --> 00:19:45.971]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:19:47.173 --> 00:19:52.395]  I just want you to think for yourselves and break free of these people that want to be the high priest that control your mind.
[00:19:53.496 --> 00:20:01.619]  I just want you to realize that we can stop these tyrants together and that we can truly live out our dreams and our destiny.
[00:20:01.639 --> 00:20:03.680]  The globalists are all about stealing and killing our destiny.
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:04.580]  We must stop them.
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.061]  Infowars.com.
[00:20:06.561 --> 00:20:08.181]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:20:08.222 --> 00:20:08.842]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:08.862 --> 00:20:09.202]  Stay with us.
[00:20:12.338 --> 00:20:16.703]  Hey, I rode the elevator with you, but I don't work on the upper floors.
[00:20:17.124 --> 00:20:23.651]  I just want to squeeze in there right next to you, so the RFID scanner in my pocket can capture all your personal information.
[00:20:23.992 --> 00:20:27.055]  Your debit and credit cards, even your work ID badge.
[00:20:27.496 --> 00:20:29.819]  So your identity is now my identity.
[00:20:30.419 --> 00:20:30.859]  Going up?
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.422]  So am I. For over 10 years, I.D.
[00:20:34.462 --> 00:20:37.804]  Stronghold has pioneered RFID-blocking wallets and I.D.
[00:20:37.844 --> 00:20:39.746]  badge holders for consumers, the U.S.
[00:20:39.786 --> 00:20:42.547]  military, and even the Executive Office of the President.
[00:20:43.068 --> 00:20:44.569]  Shouldn't you be protected too?
[00:20:45.209 --> 00:20:45.429]  I.D.
[00:20:45.469 --> 00:20:49.872]  Stronghold wallets cost about the same as wallets in most stores, but give you extra protection.
[00:20:50.193 --> 00:20:52.494]  I'm Wal Augustinowitz, founder and CEO of I.D.

[00:21:15.314 --> 00:21:18.655]  It's not about the number of servings, it's about the number of calories.
[00:21:19.035 --> 00:21:21.516]  In emergencies, calories mean survival.

[00:23:49.565 --> 00:23:50.425]  You know, Australia is a good example.
[00:23:50.445 --> 00:23:51.226]  Canada is a good example.
[00:23:51.266 --> 00:23:52.246]  The UK is a good example.
[00:23:52.266 --> 00:23:52.326]  Why?
[00:24:16.744 --> 00:24:18.605]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[00:24:19.086 --> 00:24:24.230]  Somebody somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue.
[00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.632]  Well, this is something we should politicize.
[00:24:28.313 --> 00:24:29.334]  I'm not going to carry a gun.
[00:24:29.354 --> 00:24:30.975]  I don't want to be involved in a gun fight.
[00:24:31.095 --> 00:24:43.665]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:24:49.124 --> 00:24:49.624]  Go ahead.
[00:24:50.725 --> 00:24:51.565]  Make my day.
[00:24:52.245 --> 00:24:56.167]  So the notion that gun laws don't work, it's not borne out by the evidence.
[00:24:56.567 --> 00:25:01.989]  He says that the Chicago police had a plan over this bloody 4th of July weekend.
[00:25:02.409 --> 00:25:10.873]  Nonetheless, as you indicated, Corey, there was a count of casualties that could have been from Afghanistan or Iraq.
[00:25:11.213 --> 00:25:11.693]  We'll make it.
[00:25:12.947 --> 00:25:15.808]  Harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns.
[00:25:16.248 --> 00:25:23.430]  In many cases the offenders, felons, some out on parole, some out on bond.
[00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:30.733]  We have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.
[00:25:30.913 --> 00:25:34.354]  There are people at high levels in this government who have
[00:25:35.414 --> 00:25:36.876]  Bodyguards.
[00:25:37.096 --> 00:25:38.979]  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[00:25:39.379 --> 00:25:41.401]  The average American does not have that.
[00:25:41.762 --> 00:25:47.568]  Mayor Bloomberg, why can you defend yourself but not the majority of Americans?
[00:25:47.628 --> 00:25:49.631]  I mean, look at the team of security you got.
[00:25:50.111 --> 00:25:52.435]  Every day, every school, at every level.
[00:25:52.955 --> 00:26:05.735]  One thing that I think is clear with young people, and with adults as well, is that we just have to be repetitive about this, and we need to do this every day of the week, and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:26:06.135 --> 00:26:09.716]  Was this the weapon of choice for a new kind of terrorist?
[00:26:10.056 --> 00:26:17.578]  When a five-year-old girl said she and a classmate should shoot each other with bubbles, the school called it a terrorist threat.
[00:26:18.038 --> 00:26:21.179]  AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:26:22.019 --> 00:26:26.040]  You know, the right to bear arms is because that's the last form of defense against tyranny.
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.521]  Lay down your arms, you damn rebels!
[00:26:30.219 --> 00:26:34.040]  But we don't need the ability to arm ourselves against the army or the police.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.161]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:26:36.221 --> 00:26:37.201]  would you see that happening?
[00:26:37.261 --> 00:26:41.263]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:26:41.763 --> 00:26:46.964]  The clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[00:26:47.364 --> 00:26:55.047]  To say, we're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not knocking down, if you want to come and take them!
[00:26:55.647 --> 00:27:13.361]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:27:13.661 --> 00:27:15.162]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:27:18.084 --> 00:27:21.307]  I wanted to play that intro right there because that's reality.
[00:27:21.427 --> 00:27:22.588]  Standing in front of the Alamo.
[00:27:23.578 --> 00:27:28.120]  It was so spiritual because it had just been an old feedlot after they burned it down and destroyed it.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.021]  And then it got turned into a warehouse.
[00:27:30.221 --> 00:27:44.527]  And by the 50s, it became a national landmark from the Daughters of the Republic of Texas paved with donations that people like my grandmothers got together to rebuild the Alamo.
[00:27:45.347 --> 00:27:50.029]  If you're a radio listener, that intro you heard at the end is myself speaking at the Alamo.
[00:27:51.164 --> 00:27:51.625]  We're good to go.
[00:28:12.577 --> 00:28:13.717]  Almost 200 years later.
[00:28:14.597 --> 00:28:16.978]  It was just one of the greatest pleasures of my life.
[00:28:17.578 --> 00:28:21.779]  It got to me emotionally so much, I even blew my voice out that I was screaming so loud with pleasure.
[00:28:22.579 --> 00:28:31.000]  And the reason I raise that is, that's what fulfills the soul, folks, is doing an open carry at the Alamo in defiance of laws that are clearly unconstitutional and illegal.
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.761]  And the police did the right thing and stood down.
[00:28:33.561 --> 00:28:39.302]  Not because of any threats, but because they knew the city law was trumped by the state law, and we had state officials there to point that out.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:46.544]  You have to exercise rights that are proper, and rights that are protected, and rights that are fought for, or you lose them.
[00:28:47.505 --> 00:28:54.130]  Now that said, there's an article up on Infowars.com, and I challenge you to go look at it for yourself, and I challenge even your children to go look at it.
[00:28:54.150 --> 00:29:02.116]  I don't want children to look at fake horror, but children should probably see some real horror, so they know what to fear in this world, so they can become strong to resist it.
[00:29:02.836 --> 00:29:05.598]  Muslim migrant melts off wife's face with boiling oil.
[00:29:05.618 --> 00:29:09.501]  If you're a radio listener, go to Infowars.com and look at the WorldNet Daily article.
[00:29:11.641 --> 00:29:19.024]  And she got home and he pulled back the shower curtain of her husband and said, have a look, and he was holding a pot of boiling oil.
[00:29:20.164 --> 00:29:22.105]  And he dumped it over her face.
[00:29:22.245 --> 00:29:25.046]  We're going to come back and talk about this.
[00:29:25.606 --> 00:29:27.847]  But see, that's killing people's dreams as well.
[00:29:27.907 --> 00:29:36.870]  That's what radical Islam, and most of Islam now is about, is enslaving people, controlling their minds, controlling their dreams, and mutilating them if they don't submit.
[00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:38.270]  And dominating women.
[00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:45.792]  And that's why the left loves it, because they hate women, they hate reproduction, they hate power, they hate the power of the goddess archetype.
[00:29:46.352 --> 00:29:49.833]  That's why they claim they want to represent it, because they want to dominate it and kill it.
[00:29:50.173 --> 00:29:52.653]  We'll be back with their war on women straight ahead.
[00:29:58.375 --> 00:29:59.275]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.775 --> 00:30:01.395]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.315 --> 00:30:05.016]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.139 --> 00:30:10.600]  Where do you go to leave your legacy?
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.862]  Well, if you're President Barack Obama, you go to South by Southwest.
[00:30:14.162 --> 00:30:14.643]  That's right.
[00:30:14.803 --> 00:30:23.568]  In addition to the 200,000 workers and guests and attendees who will be filling up the Austin downtown area, Barack Obama is going to show up with his giant Secret Service detail.
[00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:33.615]  Of course, in addition to tying up traffic, as Kit Daniels covered, even the Mayor of Austin is warning people to stay home on Friday, as the President's visit is sure to tie up traffic for hours on end.
[00:30:33.855 --> 00:30:37.357]  He will also be utilizing state police and local police resources.
[00:30:37.517 --> 00:30:39.418]  Which could be used during South by Southwest.
[00:30:39.618 --> 00:30:40.879]  He'll be making two stops.
[00:30:41.179 --> 00:30:43.600]  One at the Long Center for Performing Arts to give a speech.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.262]  And then jumping across the river to attend a fundraiser at Austin Music Hall.
[00:30:47.462 --> 00:30:52.404]  And then it's on to a private fundraiser at the home of Amy and Kirk Rudy, local developers here.
[00:30:52.625 --> 00:31:02.189]  It was Amy Rudy who approached a local Austin City Council member after he voted against awarding a $37 million tax rebate to her husband's company and said, don't F with my husband.
[00:31:02.329 --> 00:31:03.330]  And she repeated it twice.
[00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:05.512]  These are the kind of people Obama hangs out with.
[00:31:05.552 --> 00:31:08.335]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:31:18.527 --> 00:31:18.867]  I don't know.
[00:31:38.954 --> 00:31:39.714]  Shower filters.

[00:33:25.882 --> 00:33:27.583]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:28.023 --> 00:33:29.524]  Because there is a war on.
[00:33:29.964 --> 00:33:30.824]  For your mind.
[00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:47.632]  We are back on this live Friday, March 11 edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:47.912 --> 00:33:53.294]  Alex will be arriving shortly, so don't fear, he will be here to host the rest of the show.
[00:33:53.574 --> 00:33:55.635]  But I will be here with you until the top of the hour.
[00:33:56.276 --> 00:34:07.060]  And we're going to be talking about what happened in the debate last night, because Jake Tapper of CNN, who is normally quite a smart guy, asked a really dumb question of Donald Trump.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.801]  We're going to go ahead and play that clip.
[00:34:08.841 --> 00:34:09.321]  Here it is.
[00:34:11.906 --> 00:34:13.328]  Mr. Trump, let me start with you.
[00:34:13.788 --> 00:34:17.172]  Last night you told CNN, quote, Islam hates us.
[00:34:17.653 --> 00:34:20.376]  Did you mean all 1.6 billion Muslims?
[00:34:20.657 --> 00:34:21.598]  I mean a lot of them.
[00:34:21.898 --> 00:34:22.619]  I mean a lot of them.
[00:34:27.878 --> 00:34:29.540]  Do you want to clarify the comment at all?
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:47.357]  Well, you know, I've been watching the debate today and they're talking about radical Islamic terrorism or radical Islam, but I will tell you there's something going on that maybe you don't know about and maybe a lot of other people don't know about, but there's tremendous hatred and I will stick with exactly what I said to Anderson Cooper.
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:53.283]  So there's Trump responding to Jake Tapper's question during last night's debate.
[00:34:53.323 --> 00:35:07.732]  And obviously, every time there's a major terrorist attack, such as Paris, etc, and people make the point over and over again that Islam has a problem with violence, the common retort is always, well, are you saying that all Muslims are terrorists?
[00:35:08.073 --> 00:35:11.935]  No, that would be ridiculous and that's never been part of the argument.
[00:35:12.455 --> 00:35:14.337]  Imagine if Trump had come out and said,
[00:35:15.077 --> 00:35:17.958]  What Jake Tapper, you know, clarified this as.
[00:35:18.298 --> 00:35:23.861]  Imagine if Trump had come out and said, all 1.6 billion Muslims in the world hate America.
[00:35:24.201 --> 00:35:25.842]  That would be a ludicrous statement.
[00:35:26.142 --> 00:35:28.843]  No one would ever seriously try to argue that.
[00:35:29.243 --> 00:35:32.965]  So why do they try and frame that as Trump's argument?
[00:35:33.405 --> 00:35:38.670]  Why do they try and frame anyone's argument who says that there's a violence problem with Islam?
[00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:43.354]  Why do they try to frame it as, oh, why are you suggesting that all Muslims are terrorists?
[00:35:43.614 --> 00:35:43.834]  No!
[00:35:44.275 --> 00:35:45.376]  Nobody ever said that!
[00:35:46.376 --> 00:35:49.579]  Now Marco Rubio shot back with his own comments.
[00:35:49.619 --> 00:35:55.865]  He kind of almost topped Jake Tapper for idiocy in responding to this narrative.
[00:35:55.905 --> 00:35:57.026]  Here's Marco Rubio.
[00:35:58.864 --> 00:36:02.929]  I know that a lot of people find appeal in the things Donald says because he says what people wish they could say.
[00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:05.693]  The problem is presidents can't just say anything they want.
[00:36:05.713 --> 00:36:08.096]  It has consequences here and around the world.
[00:36:08.116 --> 00:36:11.180]  So let me give you one.
[00:36:13.308 --> 00:36:18.451]  Two days ago, I met this extraordinary couple who are on furlough because they're missionaries in Bangladesh.
[00:36:19.091 --> 00:36:20.752]  It's a very tough place to be a missionary.
[00:36:20.772 --> 00:36:21.332]  It's Muslim.
[00:36:22.072 --> 00:36:26.915]  And their safety and security very much relies upon friendly Muslims that live alongside them.
[00:36:27.375 --> 00:36:30.076]  That may not convert, but protect them and certainly look out for them.
[00:36:30.597 --> 00:36:34.579]  And their mission field really are Muslims that are looking to convert to Christianity as well.
[00:36:35.299 --> 00:36:43.882]  And they tell me that today they have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming out that in America, leading political figures are saying that America doesn't like Muslims.
[00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:45.362]  So this is a real impact.
[00:36:45.382 --> 00:36:49.323]  There is no doubt that radical Islam is a danger in the world.
[00:36:49.824 --> 00:36:55.585]  I can also tell you that if you go to any national cemetery, especially Arlington, you're going to see crescent moons there.
[00:36:55.605 --> 00:36:59.687]  If you go anywhere in the world, you're going to see American men and women serving in the Air Force.
[00:37:00.547 --> 00:37:09.414]  During last night's debate, basically trying to claim that Donald Trump is responsible for Christians being unsafe in the Muslim world.
[00:37:09.855 --> 00:37:12.056]  That's what he was implying with those comments.
[00:37:12.577 --> 00:37:20.423]  When we know that ISIS was executing Christians long before Donald Trump came along as a presidential frontrunner.
[00:37:20.844 --> 00:37:25.848]  When we know, according to this recent survey released by Open Doors, this investigation,
[00:37:26.932 --> 00:37:31.453]  Islamic extremism is the main source of persecution in 41 of the top 50 countries.
[00:37:31.493 --> 00:37:38.355]  That is, 82% of the world's persecution of Christians is being committed by Muslims.
[00:37:38.675 --> 00:37:50.119]  So Christians are unsafe in the Muslim world, not because of Donald Trump making comments, but because of violent Muslims persecuting and killing them.
[00:37:50.879 --> 00:37:55.681]  And no, my argument is not that all Muslims are violent and that they're all persecuting Christians.
[00:37:55.721 --> 00:37:57.722]  That was never the argument in the first place.
[00:37:58.203 --> 00:38:10.469]  Trump's point that Islam hates the West is in fact borne out to a large degree if you look at the figures, if you look at the polls regarding Muslim attitudes to Westerners.
[00:38:11.129 --> 00:38:22.094]  So Pew did a 2011 poll which found that Muslims have a predominantly negative view of Westerners and associated them with repugnant characteristics.
[00:38:22.894 --> 00:38:26.195]  Now this pretty much comes close to hatred if you ask me.
[00:38:27.056 --> 00:38:29.497]  So they asked Muslims in seven Muslim countries
[00:38:30.509 --> 00:38:36.034]  What they thought of Westerners, which characteristics they associated with Westerners.
[00:38:36.835 --> 00:38:39.398]  68% of Muslims thought that Westerners were selfish.
[00:38:39.418 --> 00:38:40.999]  66% thought they were violent.
[00:38:41.019 --> 00:38:42.260]  64% thought they were greedy.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.842]  61% thought they were immoral.
[00:38:43.882 --> 00:38:45.103]  And 53% thought that Westerners were fanatical.
[00:38:53.371 --> 00:39:01.818]  This is a poll of Muslims in the Muslim world, an overwhelmingly, in those cases, negative view towards Westerners.
[00:39:02.439 --> 00:39:10.865]  You flip that round, which they did in the same poll, they asked Westerners what their view of Muslims was, with the same characteristics.
[00:39:11.646 --> 00:39:14.428]  And in each case, it was significantly less.
[00:39:14.529 --> 00:39:21.855]  So Westerners had a positive view of Muslims in general, whereas Muslims had a negative view of Westerners.
[00:39:22.694 --> 00:39:27.736]  So Trump is largely accurate when he argues that Islam hates the West.
[00:39:28.237 --> 00:39:30.017]  And that's just in those characteristics.
[00:39:30.057 --> 00:39:31.658]  Of course, we can look at other polls.
[00:39:32.178 --> 00:39:36.240]  We can look at things like, is suicide bombing justified?
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.001]  Again, this is a Pew Research poll, 2013.
[00:39:41.161 --> 00:39:46.563]  In the Palestinian territories, 40% of Muslims think that suicide bombing is justified.
[00:39:46.583 --> 00:39:51.426]  29% of Egyptians think that suicide bombing is justified.
[00:39:51.966 --> 00:39:53.967]  This is not a tiny minority.
[00:39:54.707 --> 00:40:01.150]  Afghanistan, 39% of Muslims think that suicide bombings are justified.
[00:40:02.216 --> 00:40:04.959]  So it's the point that I've made over and over again in my videos.
[00:40:05.739 --> 00:40:17.150]  They try to spin this yawn that it's a tiny, tiny, fringe, extreme minority that supports these violent and intolerant views and that advocates terror attacks.
[00:40:18.745 --> 00:40:23.608]  40%?
[00:40:18.765 --> 00:40:23.608]  39%?
[00:40:18.785 --> 00:40:23.608]  29%?
[00:40:19.125 --> 00:40:23.608]  That is not a tiny minority.
[00:40:23.968 --> 00:40:25.509]  That's a substantial number.
[00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:41.521]  Then you can go and look at polls of Muslims who embrace Sharia law and what they think about honour killings, what they think about stoning women to death for adultery, what they think about executing people who leave the religion of Islam.
[00:40:42.161 --> 00:40:43.782]  And we featured these polls before.
[00:40:43.822 --> 00:40:45.444]  In fact, I made videos about it.
[00:40:46.303 --> 00:40:55.073]  If you look at these polls, they show that frightening numbers of Muslims advocate stoning women to death for adultery.
[00:40:55.914 --> 00:40:58.076]  The death penalty for leaving Islam.
[00:40:58.437 --> 00:41:04.083]  In many of these countries, and you can go and look at this, I'm putting an article out about this which will be out shortly,
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:16.110]  In some of these countries, up to 70-80% of Muslims who embrace Sharia law advocate killing people for renouncing, for leaving the faith of Islam.
[00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:17.211]  Okay?
[00:41:17.511 --> 00:41:22.675]  That is not a belief that's in line with Western principles, with Western values.
[00:41:23.096 --> 00:41:28.360]  So yes, it's perfectly legitimate to argue that Islam hates the West.
[00:41:28.921 --> 00:41:32.604]  Without this bizarre comeback from Jake Tapper,
[00:41:32.904 --> 00:41:36.205]  Well, are you saying that all 1.6 billion Muslims hate the West?
[00:41:36.565 --> 00:41:36.945]  Well, no.
[00:41:37.525 --> 00:41:54.450]  But significant numbers, and in some cases majorities of those Muslims, embrace values and beliefs which are completely reprehensible and completely inconsistent with Western values and Western liberal principles.
[00:41:54.951 --> 00:41:55.791]  That's a fact!
[00:41:56.351 --> 00:42:06.057]  And it's not a tiny minority, which is why now there's this whole movement amongst the new atheists and other people to try and start a reformation within Islam.
[00:42:06.937 --> 00:42:09.319]  People like Ayaan Hirsi Ali, ex-Muslims.
[00:42:09.739 --> 00:42:11.080]  People like Majeed Nawaz.
[00:42:11.963 --> 00:42:12.943]  Another ex-Muslim.
[00:42:13.003 --> 00:42:14.143]  In fact, he's still Muslim.
[00:42:14.183 --> 00:42:15.384]  He's a Muslim reformist.
[00:42:15.984 --> 00:42:25.066]  But Muslim reformists get shouted down again and again by largely white, middle-class leftists because they're intolerant.
[00:42:25.126 --> 00:42:26.066]  In fact, it was funny.
[00:42:26.826 --> 00:42:39.989]  One of the most virulent regressive leftists, Abbie Martin, started lecturing Majid Nawaz about how the term regressive leftist was just a buzzword used by neocons who are pro-war, etc, etc.
[00:42:41.656 --> 00:42:46.578]  Until Majid Nawaz pointed out that he coined the term regressive leftists.
[00:42:46.618 --> 00:42:52.120]  So she was trying to argue that people who use the term regressive leftists are Islamophobes.
[00:42:52.881 --> 00:42:57.623]  He shot back and basically said, well I'm a Muslim and I coined the term in the first place.
[00:42:58.123 --> 00:43:04.306]  So again we have this regressive leftist mantra which is implicit in Jake Tapper's question and this whole debate.
[00:43:05.219 --> 00:43:25.605]  But if you draw attention to the fact that frightening numbers of Muslims endorse suicide bombings, majorities of Muslims in some countries endorse stoning women to death for adultery, for alleged adultery, honour killings, you know, we've had cases in Pakistan where a woman is killed for looking at a man twice.
[00:43:26.285 --> 00:43:27.045]  That happened.
[00:43:27.585 --> 00:43:31.366]  We had a teenager in Somalia back, I believe it was a couple of years ago.
[00:43:32.686 --> 00:43:34.167]  Brutal honour killing there.
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:40.643]  You know, beliefs where they endorse killing homosexuals, executing people who leave the religion of Islam.
[00:43:40.823 --> 00:43:43.584]  These are not beliefs held by a tiny minority.
[00:43:44.305 --> 00:43:52.429]  And that point is manifestly provable in the polls conducted by Pew, which I'm going to cite in this article and which I've cited in my videos.
[00:43:53.710 --> 00:44:01.294]  The truth about Islam and Islam is not a religion of peace, for which I've received multiple death threats because, of course,
[00:44:02.259 --> 00:44:06.283]  Islam is a religion of peace, that's why people threaten to kill you if you say it's not.
[00:44:06.363 --> 00:44:06.644]  Okay.
[00:44:08.686 --> 00:44:12.971]  So again, we see this narrative over and over again and now it's spilled out.
[00:44:12.991 --> 00:44:15.673]  Here's another article out of Associated Press.
[00:44:16.855 --> 00:44:20.258]  Dubai official warns of clash of civilizations over Trump.
[00:44:21.144 --> 00:44:28.930]  Top security official in Dubai warned Friday of a clash of civilizations if US Republican candidate Donald Trump becomes president.
[00:44:29.411 --> 00:44:34.115]  The latest sign of disquiet across the Middle East over the businessman's comments about Muslims.
[00:44:34.135 --> 00:44:42.721]  And this is Lieutenant General Daheem Kalfan Tamim, the Deputy Chairman of Police and General Security in Dubai.
[00:44:43.802 --> 00:44:50.328]  So he's basically saying that Donald Trump's comments are what is going to stoke a clash of civilizations.
[00:44:51.286 --> 00:44:54.850]  Not the fact that huge numbers of Muslims support suicide bombings.
[00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:56.331]  No, that's nothing to do with it.
[00:44:57.372 --> 00:45:04.239]  Not the fact that huge numbers of them support beliefs that are completely inconsistent and incompatible with Western beliefs.
[00:45:04.459 --> 00:45:05.860]  That's nothing to do with it.
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.263]  It's because Donald Trump made a comment.
[00:45:09.622 --> 00:45:16.328]  And what's even more frightening about this is that it's not just reserved to Muslims who are living in the Muslim world.
[00:45:16.388 --> 00:45:32.623]  In fact, a Center for Security Policy survey conducted last year found that more than half of Muslims living in the United States agreed that, quote, Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Sharia law.
[00:45:33.635 --> 00:45:47.594]  So in other words, all those practices I just mentioned, stoning women to death, killing homosexuals, executing people who leave the religion of Islam, and a whole bunch of different ideas, beliefs and practices in law,
[00:45:48.615 --> 00:45:54.299]  Where it's, you know, a woman's testimony, a Muslim woman's testimony counts for half of a man's.
[00:45:54.899 --> 00:45:59.943]  It's impossible, basically, for a Muslim woman to get divorced, even if she's been beaten up and abused.
[00:46:00.463 --> 00:46:05.227]  But a Muslim man can get divorced, basically, just by saying, I divorced you!
[00:46:05.467 --> 00:46:06.428]  That's Sharia law!
[00:46:06.468 --> 00:46:12.112]  It's really progressive and trendy and liberal and it's a, you know, really hardcore feminist cause.
[00:46:12.152 --> 00:46:13.553]  That's why they all embrace it, I guess.
[00:46:14.795 --> 00:46:15.897]  So this is a concern.
[00:46:16.017 --> 00:46:28.834]  Half of Muslims, more than half of Muslims think that those kind of practices and beliefs, that they should have the choice to exhibit them, to express them, to codify them into law in many cases in America.
[00:46:29.435 --> 00:46:32.138]  It's already happening in some places of the United Kingdom.
[00:46:33.134 --> 00:46:48.825]  Now we had another video in this, The Truth About Islam, which is on my YouTube channel, where it's basically a conference of Muslims in Norway, and the speaker says he's really upset about the fact that the establishment media
[00:46:49.625 --> 00:46:56.754]  ...is framing moderate Muslims as being against stoning women to death, honour killings, you know, killing homosexuals.
[00:46:57.314 --> 00:47:01.319]  He basically gets up and says, these are the beliefs of moderate Muslims.
[00:47:01.699 --> 00:47:03.481]  Then he takes a poll of the audience.
[00:47:04.414 --> 00:47:06.495]  You know, 200 Muslim men sitting there.
[00:47:07.235 --> 00:47:10.157]  Arab Muslims, black Muslims, white Muslims.
[00:47:10.497 --> 00:47:13.818]  He asked them, raise your hand if you agree that homosexuals should be killed.
[00:47:14.539 --> 00:47:16.820]  If you agree with stoning to death for adultery.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.001]  Everyone in the house raises their hand.
[00:47:20.442 --> 00:47:23.323]  And these are so-called moderate Muslims.
[00:47:25.051 --> 00:47:35.018]  So yes, if you believe that those kind of beliefs are antagonistic and incompatible with Western beliefs, then doesn't that mean that Islam hates the West?
[00:47:35.559 --> 00:47:42.964]  Doesn't mean that every Muslim hates the West, or that every Muslim is a terrorist, because Donald Trump has never made that argument.
[00:47:43.465 --> 00:47:48.769]  Nobody with any serious credibility has ever made that argument, because that's not the argument.
[00:47:49.409 --> 00:47:52.331]  But they try and frame it as that over and over again.
[00:47:52.972 --> 00:47:56.054]  So we've got an article coming out on that shortly.
[00:47:56.074 --> 00:48:00.358]  And again, it's going to include this, which is a report I put out a few weeks ago.
[00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:18.142]  Muslim refugees arriving in Alberta, Canada were welcomed by a pro-ISIS hate preacher who called for the destruction of enemies of Islam and prayed for jihadists to, quote, hit their target.
[00:48:18.942 --> 00:48:20.744]  This is a preacher in Canada.
[00:48:20.764 --> 00:48:22.526]  This is not in Afghanistan.
[00:48:22.946 --> 00:48:23.967]  It's not in Pakistan.
[00:48:24.027 --> 00:48:24.768]  It's in Canada.
[00:48:24.788 --> 00:48:27.831]  He's welcoming the refugees coming into Canada.
[00:48:28.692 --> 00:48:38.054]  By saying basically that he advocates terrorism, he advocates jihadist attacks to destroy the enemies of Islam, which of course is the West.
[00:48:39.054 --> 00:48:57.759]  So when Donald Trump says Islam hates the West, this proves that he's got a point, and that it's not an outlier, it's not a ludicrous statement to make, and as I've made the argument many times over and over again, it's not a tiny fringe minority of Muslims that believe this.
[00:48:58.641 --> 00:49:09.670]  It's a frightening number and in some cases it's the majority of Muslims, especially when you look at Muslim attitudes to the West amongst Muslims who are living in the Middle East.
[00:49:10.791 --> 00:49:13.553]  And on that subject we've got this article out of WorldNetDaily.
[00:49:14.374 --> 00:49:18.197]  Muslim migrant melts off wife's face with boiling oil.
[00:49:19.397 --> 00:49:23.621]  This is the very tolerant, inclusive culture that we're importing into the West.
[00:49:23.661 --> 00:49:25.103]  This is our cultural enrichment.
[00:49:25.503 --> 00:49:27.926]  Pouring boiling oil over women's faces.
[00:49:27.946 --> 00:49:30.068]  Of course the feminists don't care about it.
[00:49:30.088 --> 00:49:31.469]  They're too busy complaining about...
[00:49:32.458 --> 00:49:36.861]  Manspreading and other gross violations of women's rights like that.
[00:49:37.621 --> 00:49:48.868]  When Homer, the 48-year-old wife of Muhammad, pulled back the shower curtain after her husband told her to have a look at what he was holding, the pot of hot, boiling oil in his hands was not what she expected.
[00:49:49.548 --> 00:49:56.433]  In a matter of seconds, her face was gone, melted, and the right hand she raised to protect herself permanently feud shut.
[00:49:57.392 --> 00:50:04.820]  She was left with burns over 44% of her body, scarred forever, to restore her husband's honour.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:15.210]  So basically, the husband got jealous that she was interested in another man, no proof that she'd even had any contact or sexual relations with him.
[00:50:15.611 --> 00:50:19.835]  And of course, the rational solution to that, if you believe these tenants,
[00:50:21.027 --> 00:50:24.048]  Is to pour hot boiling water over that woman's face.
[00:50:24.088 --> 00:50:26.709]  That's a completely reasonable response.
[00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:28.130]  I guess you would agree.
[00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:30.971]  Of course, not a peep from feminists.
[00:50:31.071 --> 00:50:32.111]  Nothing whatsoever.
[00:50:32.131 --> 00:50:34.832]  Here's another story out of Breitbart.
[00:50:35.813 --> 00:50:37.833]  Quote, people like you should be shocked.
[00:50:38.113 --> 00:50:41.895]  Muslim taxi driver beat up gay couple for kissing in his cab.
[00:50:42.912 --> 00:50:51.576]  A Muslim taxi driver in Vienna, Austria punched a gay man in the mouth during an altercation of what does and does not constitute acceptable public behaviour.
[00:50:52.056 --> 00:50:57.439]  That's what's happening in Austria as part of this cultural enrichment.
[00:50:58.039 --> 00:51:01.861]  We'll be back after the break to delve more into this and other news stories.

[00:52:13.966 --> 00:52:21.110]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:52:21.711 --> 00:52:30.096]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:52:30.317 --> 00:52:34.499]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:39.923]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics, the destroyer of our towns,
[00:52:39.923 --> 00:52:40.163]  We're good.
[00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:16.152]  If you want to raise the next generation of patriot leaders, take a look at Freedom Project Academy, a Judeo-Christian online school for kindergarten through high school.
[00:53:16.472 --> 00:53:18.972]  No common core teaching methods or high-stakes testing.
[00:53:19.193 --> 00:53:25.174]  Freedom Project Academy is government-free, doesn't accept any government funding, and is a fully accredited private school.
[00:53:25.534 --> 00:53:28.675]  All classes are taught live online with real teachers across the country.
[00:53:28.875 --> 00:53:32.116]  Open enrollment runs March through July, but classes fill up quickly.
[00:53:32.336 --> 00:53:35.036]  Check them out at FPEUSA.org.
[00:53:35.236 --> 00:53:37.257]  That's FPEUSA.org.
[00:53:38.397 --> 00:53:39.438]  Attention, citizens.
[00:53:39.658 --> 00:53:45.503]  This man has received national attention for accurately predicting every major financial trend, including the market crash of 2008.
[00:53:45.803 --> 00:53:55.790]  His name is Harry Dent, and in his newly released book, he is making even bigger and bolder predictions that have the potential to devastate the world economy and your personal wealth.
[00:53:55.951 --> 00:54:04.657]  You can get a free copy of Harry Dent's bestseller, The Demographic Cliff, containing never-before-published information by simply visiting www.harrydentresearch.com.
[00:54:04.817 --> 00:54:07.900]  Again, that's www.harrydentresearch.com.
[00:54:09.269 --> 00:54:13.131]  Federal Agents, we are armed!
[00:54:13.171 --> 00:54:19.014]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[00:54:19.074 --> 00:54:20.955]  Would you stand up for true?
[00:54:21.075 --> 00:54:22.476]  Or would you turn away too?
[00:54:22.776 --> 00:54:27.259]  And then what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[00:54:27.839 --> 00:54:34.866]  We are back on the Alex Jones Show, and this was an interesting story that came up yesterday.
[00:54:34.906 --> 00:54:41.333]  Of course, the singer of the Eagles of Death Metal, the band involved in the tragic Bataclan theatre attack.
[00:54:41.973 --> 00:54:46.858]  Again, their audience goers and the band were targeted during the Paris massacre back in November.
[00:54:47.779 --> 00:54:58.064]  Of course he came out yesterday and said he suspects that the attack was an inside job because he noticed that many of the members of the security team had failed to show up.
[00:54:58.464 --> 00:55:02.546]  He noticed that one of them was acting shifty, refusing to look him in the eye.
[00:55:02.986 --> 00:55:05.167]  Obviously doesn't constitute bombshell evidence.
[00:55:06.067 --> 00:55:10.532]  But I can shed some more light on this because we've got another report out of The Local.
[00:55:11.293 --> 00:55:14.937]  Radicalisation among police, a growing concern for France.
[00:55:15.397 --> 00:55:24.647]  A leaked memo has revealed that not even the French police is spared from the phenomenon of radicalisation or fundamentalism, with a number of cases highlighted in recent years.
[00:55:25.737 --> 00:55:38.146]  So they're seeing a lot of cases in France now where the police officers, these Muslim police officers, will refuse to stand guard outside a synagogue, will refuse to observe minute silences.
[00:55:39.059 --> 00:55:40.420]  And it's becoming a real concern.
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:52.630]  The Parisian newspaper, which revealed the leaked memo, claimed the officers were identified for acts such as refusing to stand guard outside a synagogue, refusing to suspect respect in minutes' silence.
[00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:59.355]  One officer even put out a call on Facebook, a call to murder on Facebook, which landed him in court, the Parisian claimed.
[00:55:59.755 --> 00:56:05.559]  The newspaper claimed police in Paris were now recording transgressions on a weekly basis.
[00:56:06.345 --> 00:56:16.834]  So they've got a huge problem with potential Islamists getting jobs in the police force and then allowing their police to overshadow their job, basically.
[00:56:17.294 --> 00:56:30.084]  So the claim that some of these security guards, which, I mean, this is essentially what the Eagles of Death Metal singer is arguing, that they may have been jihadists in on the plot, in on the massacre,
[00:56:30.945 --> 00:56:33.467]  That gives that claim a little more credibility.
[00:56:33.907 --> 00:56:40.652]  From the comments that I've read, he's not, you know, trying to claim that the French government itself was responsible for an inside job.
[00:56:40.692 --> 00:56:50.959]  He's claiming that there could have been Islamist jihadists on the inside who got jobs working as security at the Bataclan, who maybe helped facilitate the attack.
[00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:55.042]  But not a great deal of evidence to back up those claims so far.
[00:56:55.062 --> 00:56:58.565]  Of course the Bataclan have come out forcefully and denied them.
[00:56:58.705 --> 00:57:00.767]  Basically said his comments are defamatory.
[00:57:01.387 --> 00:57:03.169]  So we'll definitely keep track of that one.
[00:57:04.773 --> 00:57:13.681]  The Archbishop, one of the top Archbishops, the Archbishop of Canterbury in England has declared that it's not racist to fear migration.
[00:57:13.781 --> 00:57:23.610]  He's committed the thought crime of saying that people who have concerns about millions of individuals pouring into the West aren't necessarily racist.
[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:29.321]  Britain's have a justified fear of mass immigration, the Archbishop of Canterbury has declared.
[00:57:29.922 --> 00:57:37.804]  Justin Welby said it was absolutely outrageous to condemn people who raise concerns about the influx of large numbers of migrants as racist.
[00:57:37.844 --> 00:57:44.246]  He said the scale of Europe's migrant crisis meant such anxieties were entirely reasonable.
[00:57:45.086 --> 00:57:51.094]  Now we have police in Sweden being forced to defend a warning that women don't go out at night.
[00:57:51.134 --> 00:57:57.502]  Of course, Sweden is one of the countries that has reaped the benefits of this cultural enrichment with its 1400% rape increase.
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:05.043]  And now the police are telling women in certain areas of Sweden not to go out at night.
[00:58:05.803 --> 00:58:12.868]  Police in Östersund in northern Sweden have warned women about being out on their own after dark, but the city's mayor has trashed the idea.
[00:58:13.508 --> 00:58:21.954]  Officers in Östersund first advised women not to walk around on their own at night during a press conference on Monday, and now basically there's a huge backlash against it.
[00:58:22.554 --> 00:58:25.456]  Even the feminists are starting to speak out against it, but again,
[00:58:25.996 --> 00:58:28.738]  They're not identifying why this is a problem.
[00:58:29.159 --> 00:58:32.922]  It's because of these waves of people have no respect for women whatsoever.
[00:58:33.322 --> 00:58:39.227]  In Denmark, they're having to put them through sexual consent courses and it's really not working.
[00:58:39.268 --> 00:58:41.469]  We'll be back in the next segment.
[00:58:41.549 --> 00:58:42.931]  It's the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:58:43.111 --> 00:58:45.613]  Breaking news at Infowars.com.
[00:58:45.673 --> 00:58:50.617]  Stay right there.
[00:58:50.637 --> 00:58:52.159]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:58.831 --> 00:59:03.153]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:59:03.474 --> 00:59:08.096]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:59:08.236 --> 00:59:09.277]  Talk about the effects.
[00:59:09.557 --> 00:59:11.058]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:59:11.078 --> 00:59:12.679]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:59:12.999 --> 00:59:14.060]  I feel like I look better.
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:14.760]  I feel better.
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:15.881]  I feel sexier.
[00:59:15.901 --> 00:59:16.601]  I love it.
[00:59:16.862 --> 00:59:19.763]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:59:19.823 --> 00:59:22.525]  Get a bottle of super male, a bottle of super female.
[00:59:22.765 --> 00:59:23.786]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:59:23.826 --> 00:59:24.867]  Consult your physician.
[00:59:25.027 --> 00:59:27.229]  Visit InfoWarsLive.com today.
[00:59:27.389 --> 00:59:28.330]  This is life-changing.
[00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:29.431]  Shower filters.
[00:59:29.591 --> 00:59:31.192]  We're introducing the best yet.
[00:59:31.313 --> 00:59:35.236]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[00:59:35.376 --> 00:59:40.000]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:47.126]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[00:59:47.287 --> 00:59:50.009]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free shipping
[00:59:50.009 --> 00:59:51.150]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:20.091 --> 01:00:21.991]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:22.411 --> 01:00:29.693]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:30.053 --> 01:00:42.876]  Remember when 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner President Barack Obama bragged to his aides that he is really good at killing people in the book Double Down while discussing drone strikes?
[01:00:43.176 --> 01:00:44.816]  Well, just how good is he?
[01:00:45.516 --> 01:00:51.539]  Obama has managed to kill innocent civilians in Afghanistan with a 90% success rate.
[01:00:51.659 --> 01:00:57.962]  And according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Obama's CIA drone strikes have killed children.
[01:00:58.342 --> 01:01:00.944]  And our Commander-in-Chief has bragged about it.
[01:01:01.224 --> 01:01:05.326]  The next time some liberal rattles on about how great Obama is,
[01:01:05.626 --> 01:01:08.267]  Remind them of this horrifying statistic.
[01:01:08.587 --> 01:01:24.090]  And now the Pentagon has finally issued a report made public by a FOIA request stating that unmanned military aircraft have been deployed on non-military missions that have occurred fewer than 20 times between 2006 and 2015 and always in compliance with existing law.
[01:01:29.051 --> 01:01:38.134]  Back in 2013, we caught a glimpse of the use of military drones in the United States when then-FBI Director Robert Mueller testified before Congress.
[01:01:38.514 --> 01:01:41.155]  Our footprint is very small.
[01:01:41.496 --> 01:01:51.359]  We have very few and have limited use and we're exploring not only the use but also the necessary guidelines for that use.
[01:01:51.979 --> 01:01:55.861]  Does the FBI use drones for surveillance on U.S.
[01:01:55.901 --> 01:01:56.161]  soil?
[01:01:56.821 --> 01:01:57.041]  Yes.
[01:01:57.362 --> 01:02:06.694]  The recent revelations of the robbery of liberty for supposed security by an out-of-control myriad of federal alphabet agencies is nothing new.
[01:02:07.134 --> 01:02:12.662]  Kurt Nimmo writes, a 400-page Defense Department document obtained by NBC News in 2004
[01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:20.587]  Revealed the Pentagon's increased domestic spying activity on anti-war groups following the 9-11 attacks.
[01:02:20.887 --> 01:02:28.112]  The CIA also spied on and subverted the anti-war movement with its Operation Chaos in the late 1960s.
[01:02:28.392 --> 01:02:31.874]  Additionally, the agency covertly launched Project Merrimack
[01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:39.037]  To infiltrate and subvert domestic political groups despite the CIA charter forbidding such activity.
[01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:50.322]  In 2012, Infowars.com reported on Obama's Environmental Protection Agency using aerial drones to spy on farmers and cattle ranchers in Nebraska and Iowa.
[01:02:50.522 --> 01:02:54.664]  The surveillance came under scrutiny after Nebraska's congressional delegation
[01:02:54.924 --> 01:02:58.365]  sent a joint letter to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson.
[01:02:58.645 --> 01:03:01.365]  The EPA argued the flights are legal.
[01:03:01.786 --> 01:03:15.649]  Jackson said courts, including the Supreme Court, have found similar types of flights to be legal and EPA would use such flights in appropriate instances to protect people and the environment from violations of the Clean Water Act.
[01:03:15.849 --> 01:03:21.950]  Oh, and what a stellar job the EPA is doing, as is evident in Durango, Colorado and Flint, Michigan.
[01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:32.713]  Despite the fact the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the military from operating on American soil, the Pentagon has busied itself with establishing drone bases within the United States.
[01:03:32.953 --> 01:03:43.457]  Public Intelligence, a non-profit advocating free access to government information, released a map of military UAV activities inside the United States in 2012.
[01:03:44.537 --> 01:03:50.882]  According to the organization, it is not clear if the bases are used for foreign missions or domestic surveillance.
[01:03:51.182 --> 01:04:03.792]  A list produced by the Federal Aviation Administration in response to an Electronic Freedom Foundation Freedom of Information Act lawsuit also shows numerous drone bases within the continental United States.
[01:04:04.332 --> 01:04:08.815]  In June of 2015, drone pilots were walking off their jobs in droves.
[01:04:09.035 --> 01:04:12.157]  International Business Times reported a group of 45 U.S.
[01:04:12.617 --> 01:04:28.488]  military veterans have signed a letter appealing to pilots responsible for carrying out deadly aerial military drone strikes in countries like Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan to stand down and deliberately refuse to carry out their orders.
[01:04:28.728 --> 01:04:30.329]  The letter was submitted to U.S.
[01:04:30.389 --> 01:04:33.691]  media outlets by anti-drone group No Drones.
[01:04:33.991 --> 01:04:38.072]  Pleading with drone pilots to refuse to fly surveillance and kill missions.
[01:04:38.392 --> 01:04:40.753]  It's as clear as the nose on your face.
[01:04:41.113 --> 01:04:58.577]  The level of treason required to ignore the Constitution, your fellow Americans' rights, and basic human empathy and compassion can only be stomached by the anti-American criminals calling the shots in the highest offices in Washington D.C.
[01:04:58.817 --> 01:05:00.798]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[01:05:09.113 --> 01:05:10.554]  Where do you go to leave your legacy?
[01:05:10.694 --> 01:05:13.835]  Well, if you're President Barack Obama, you go to South by Southwest.
[01:05:14.135 --> 01:05:14.615]  That's right.
[01:05:14.755 --> 01:05:23.538]  In addition to the 200,000 workers and guests and attendees who will be filling up the Austin downtown area, Barack Obama is going to show up with his giant Secret Service detail.
[01:05:23.758 --> 01:05:33.582]  Of course, in addition to tying up traffic, as Kit Daniels covered, even the Mayor of Austin is warning people to stay home on Friday as the President's visit is sure to tie up traffic for hours on end.
[01:05:33.822 --> 01:05:37.323]  He will also be utilizing state police and local police resources.
[01:05:37.483 --> 01:05:39.384]  Which could be used during South by Southwest.
[01:05:39.584 --> 01:05:40.845]  He'll be making two stops.
[01:05:41.165 --> 01:05:43.567]  One at the Long Center for Performing Arts to give a speech.
[01:05:43.807 --> 01:05:47.229]  And then jumping across the river to attend a fundraiser at Austin Music Hall.
[01:05:47.429 --> 01:05:52.352]  And then it's on to a private fundraiser at the home of Amy and Kirk Rudy, local developers here.
[01:05:52.592 --> 01:06:02.158]  It was Amy Rudy who approached a local Austin City Council member after he voted against awarding a $37 million tax rebate to her husband's company and said, don't F with my husband.
[01:06:02.298 --> 01:06:03.299]  And she repeated it twice.
[01:06:03.499 --> 01:06:05.481]  These are the kind of people Obama hangs out with.
[01:06:05.521 --> 01:06:08.344]  Rob Dewey reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:06:08.805 --> 01:06:12.008]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:06:12.328 --> 01:06:20.336]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:06:20.557 --> 01:06:25.562]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:07:11.872 --> 01:07:12.793]  But where do you get it?
[01:07:13.073 --> 01:07:18.838]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:07:19.078 --> 01:07:24.803]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[01:08:09.648 --> 01:08:10.369]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:08:10.649 --> 01:08:11.730]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.871]  Mao took the guns.
[01:08:12.891 --> 01:08:14.372]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[01:08:14.392 --> 01:08:15.773]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[01:08:15.953 --> 01:08:21.218]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[01:08:21.238 --> 01:08:25.702]  It doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken.
[01:08:25.902 --> 01:08:27.223]  We will not relinquish them.
[01:08:27.423 --> 01:08:28.304]  Do you understand?
[01:08:28.324 --> 01:08:33.989]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:08:34.549 --> 01:08:36.051]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:40.197 --> 01:08:41.438]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:08:41.478 --> 01:08:42.459]  That's Friday, March 11, 2016.
[01:08:43.159 --> 01:08:45.420]  I'm David Knight here in Austin.
[01:08:46.161 --> 01:08:48.242]  Austin has been turned upside down.
[01:08:48.302 --> 01:08:57.928]  Not only do we have South by Southwest opening today, but President Obama decided he would make things a little bit more unbearable for us here in Austin by showing up for South by Southwest.
[01:08:57.968 --> 01:09:02.952]  And of course, Michelle is going to be coming on a second different visit at some point in the next 10 days.
[01:09:03.832 --> 01:09:04.934]  Here's how this is playing out.
[01:09:04.955 --> 01:09:12.770]  You know, whenever we have an event that the government gets involved in, they always step up security to an even more absurd level than it was the time before.
[01:09:13.599 --> 01:09:18.883]  Every event has to be clamped down more tightly.
[01:09:19.284 --> 01:09:34.176]  What's going on now, we got a story up on Infowars.com, earlier this week the Secret Service visited the 360 Tower in Austin, Texas, told the management that residents of the building will not be allowed to access to their balconies during Obama's visit to the city on Friday.
[01:09:34.216 --> 01:09:39.981]  So, you know, if you've got a, you live in an apartment in the city, you've got a balcony, stay off of your balcony.
[01:09:40.581 --> 01:09:41.082]  Get inside.
[01:09:41.988 --> 01:09:48.612]  The next thing they'll be doing is demanding that we close our curtains as well so we do not gaze upon the anointed one as he goes past us.
[01:09:49.332 --> 01:10:07.143]  This is the kind of total paranoia that the police state continues to ramp up and yet they can't be concerned enough about security, real security, to lock up Hillary Clinton when she conspires to put top secret documents on her private server and lie about it.
[01:10:07.915 --> 01:10:08.215]  Come on!
[01:10:09.035 --> 01:10:16.657]  The national security state religion here, where you can't even walk out on your balcony as the motorcade is distantly passing away, okay?
[01:10:17.037 --> 01:10:18.477]  You have to stay in your apartment.
[01:10:18.777 --> 01:10:24.598]  The next thing they're going to do is they're going to tell people there'll be some Secret Service agents by about an hour before the President comes by.
[01:10:24.638 --> 01:10:27.378]  They're going to tie you to your chair and blindfold you as well.
[01:10:28.359 --> 01:10:28.659]  Okay?
[01:10:28.899 --> 01:10:31.359]  I mean, this is getting beyond belief.
[01:10:31.819 --> 01:10:33.499]  And so that's what's going on in Austin right now.
[01:10:33.519 --> 01:10:34.540]  It's very difficult to get around.
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:35.860]  We're going to
[01:10:37.039 --> 01:10:37.959]  We'll be reporting on this.
[01:10:37.979 --> 01:10:39.440]  We've got our reporters on the street.
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:42.781]  And of course, we have the Brokered Convention has already started.
[01:10:43.742 --> 01:10:44.262]  Did you know that?
[01:10:45.222 --> 01:10:48.364]  You know, all this talk about the Brokered Convention, but it started, folks.
[01:10:49.484 --> 01:10:56.387]  You've got Jeb Bush meeting in secret with Rubio, Kasich, Cruz before the debate, plotting on what they're going to do to Donald Trump.
[01:10:56.407 --> 01:10:57.787]  You know, it was reported in the mainstream media.
[01:10:57.807 --> 01:11:01.569]  Well, it's not clear that there's going to be an endorsement at this time from Jeb Bush.
[01:11:01.609 --> 01:11:01.889]  Come on.
[01:11:02.549 --> 01:11:03.770]  That's not the tack they're taking.
[01:11:04.724 --> 01:11:08.767]  They are conspiring to, I mean, he wouldn't meet with Trump.
[01:11:08.787 --> 01:11:11.589]  Of course, he knows he's not going to get an appointment from Trump.
[01:11:11.849 --> 01:11:14.851]  Trump would just look at him and say, Jeb, you're a mess.
[01:11:15.631 --> 01:11:16.472]  And he would be right.
[01:11:17.012 --> 01:11:19.974]  But of course, they're going to do these backroom deals.
[01:11:20.614 --> 01:11:21.815]  I can just imagine what's going on.
[01:11:21.855 --> 01:11:24.917]  This is arm-twisting incentives being handed out.
[01:11:25.798 --> 01:11:31.462]  I think that the Bushes and this movement behind Cruz, you saw, first you saw Brother Neal.
[01:11:32.577 --> 01:11:34.479]  Come in as his finance manager.
[01:11:34.499 --> 01:11:42.367]  If you're not questioning the judgment and the integrity of Ted Cruz, that should do it right there, in and of itself.
[01:11:43.103 --> 01:12:05.408]  Neil Bush, whose sole accomplishment is to be the pin that created the S&L, that burst the S&L bubble, okay, with his fraud, with his crony connections, coming in and using the people that he knows to get a two and a half million dollar loan, and then they find out that this company that he got the loan on has nothing but a worthless oil lease that he paid
[01:12:06.028 --> 01:12:07.849]  That the company paid Neil Bush $100,000, $150,000.
[01:12:08.089 --> 01:12:13.513]  It's been a while since I looked at the numbers on that, but it was fraudulent, okay?
[01:12:13.533 --> 01:12:18.876]  It kicked off the biggest financial crisis that we had until his brother became president.
[01:12:20.777 --> 01:12:24.239]  Not that that was solely the fault of George W. Bush, but you know what?
[01:12:24.279 --> 01:12:25.680]  The buck stops there, folks.
[01:12:26.981 --> 01:12:35.046]  Nevertheless, we've got Neil Bush getting behind and coming on board with Ted Cruz as a finance advisor.
[01:12:36.766 --> 01:12:40.831]  Yeah, between that and Goldman Sachs and these other people and then hiding his loans.
[01:12:40.871 --> 01:12:45.917]  Maybe Neil is going to show him how to hide the finances so that people can't find it.
[01:12:45.937 --> 01:12:46.438]  I don't know.
[01:12:47.059 --> 01:12:52.766]  But that happens and the next day we find that also Jeb is meeting with all the candidates except Trump.
[01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:58.654]  Now, when we look at some of the people who are doing endorsements, we've had a lot of endorsements.
[01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:02.015]  We've had Ben Carson today endorsing Donald Trump.
[01:13:02.035 --> 01:13:03.776]  We're going to talk about what's behind that.
[01:13:04.576 --> 01:13:06.496]  Chuck Norris endorsing Ted Cruz.
[01:13:06.516 --> 01:13:07.817]  Oh, that didn't happen.
[01:13:07.837 --> 01:13:09.857]  That was widely reported.
[01:13:09.957 --> 01:13:13.618]  He was supposed to be at one of the events and then they had to walk that back.
[01:13:14.118 --> 01:13:17.919]  Chuck Norris made it clear he's not endorsing Ted Cruz or anybody for that matter.
[01:13:18.319 --> 01:13:20.180]  And then the strangest endorsement of all.
[01:13:21.388 --> 01:13:25.469]  Marco Rubio has endorsed John Kasich in Ohio.
[01:13:25.489 --> 01:13:26.790]  Hmm, how's that?
[01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:31.171]  Yeah, so you gotta stop Trump by any means, okay?
[01:13:31.691 --> 01:13:32.731]  That's what these guys are doing.
[01:13:32.751 --> 01:13:35.212]  They're plotting on how they're going to stop Trump.
[01:13:35.652 --> 01:13:39.553]  And Jeb thinks that he can be the guy in charge of this.
[01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:41.114]  He can make a deal.
[01:13:41.294 --> 01:13:43.554]  Let's all coalesce behind Cruz.
[01:13:43.634 --> 01:13:45.255]  We can do this kind of brokered thing.
[01:13:45.275 --> 01:13:46.255]  And you know what?
[01:13:46.635 --> 01:13:48.936]  I'm sure that he's, when he meets with Ted Cruz,
[01:13:49.736 --> 01:13:58.201]  What he's telling Cruz is what you've got the Cruz media, people like Mark Levin, saying Ted Cruz is a reincarnation of Ronald Reagan.
[01:13:59.421 --> 01:14:02.803]  You know what, if you believe that, you're the low information voter.
[01:14:02.823 --> 01:14:10.267]  You know, Ted Cruz went out and told people that he opined that Trump supporters are low information voters.
[01:14:11.968 --> 01:14:18.032]  You know, if you believe that Ted Cruz is a conservative and not a neocon, you may be a low information voter.
[01:14:18.803 --> 01:14:22.525]  You may also be a low-information voter if you think Ted Cruz is an outsider.
[01:14:22.585 --> 01:14:24.666]  He is the ultimate insider.
[01:14:25.366 --> 01:14:28.888]  He has been inside the Bush administration for a long time.
[01:14:28.948 --> 01:14:31.829]  He and Heidi bragged that they were the first Bush marriage.
[01:14:31.889 --> 01:14:35.011]  They were both insiders throughout the Bush organization.
[01:14:35.051 --> 01:14:40.353]  They have both been neocons, part of the establishment that pushes war.
[01:14:40.753 --> 01:14:42.414]  All the time they were in the Bush administration.
[01:14:42.474 --> 01:14:46.036]  Then when he decided that he wanted to run as president,
[01:14:46.889 --> 01:14:54.712]  You know, first he is this obsequious, greasy, oily little guy that is working his way through the bureaucracy, and then he gets elected Senator.
[01:14:54.732 --> 01:14:59.994]  After he becomes Senator, he starts climbing over the backs of the Senators.
[01:15:00.014 --> 01:15:01.054]  That's why they hate him so much.
[01:15:01.094 --> 01:15:02.695]  Immediately begins running for President.
[01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:11.248]  Okay, he's gone through, what is it, three, four, I guess it was three years into his term, he was already openly running for president.
[01:15:11.268 --> 01:15:12.828]  He started running for president right away.
[01:15:13.668 --> 01:15:20.269]  Last December, the National Review was calling him on the carpet for throwing the term neocon around.
[01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:24.770]  They said that's a toxic term, it's radioactive, it's an epithet, it's pejorative.
[01:15:25.290 --> 01:15:27.851]  It's a dog whistle to his supporters.
[01:15:28.988 --> 01:15:29.648]  Yeah, it was.
[01:15:29.788 --> 01:15:31.929]  It was a dog whistle to his supporters.
[01:15:32.369 --> 01:15:41.152]  That was how he was going to create his bona fides as a, uh, as a, uh, got my phone going off here.
[01:15:41.212 --> 01:15:41.792]  Hang on a second.
[01:15:43.492 --> 01:15:45.093]  Um, sorry about that, folks.
[01:15:46.873 --> 01:15:49.154]  The, um, that was his bona fide.
[01:15:49.574 --> 01:15:52.575]  That was the way that he was going to tell everybody that he was an outsider.
[01:15:53.575 --> 01:15:56.076]  And of course, it was the National Review, which is the
[01:15:57.837 --> 01:16:03.940]  The magazine on record of the neocon movement that called him on the carpet for it.
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:15.545]  Now we see the very people who are out there saying, you're using a dog whistle, you're throwing people on the bus, you're calling us warmongers, those same warmongers, people like John Bolton and others, now are his close advisors.
[01:16:16.445 --> 01:16:25.971]  So if you look at the people who are lining up behind Ted Cruz, you understand the guy is not a conservative, he's a neocon, he's not an outsider, he is the ultimate insider.
[01:16:26.431 --> 01:16:28.292]  And he is part of the Bush family.
[01:16:28.312 --> 01:16:40.039]  Of course, the statement that Roger Stone gave us during the interview talking about how Ted Cruz is a Bush by another name, he wrote an op-ed piece that appeared in the Daily Caller pointing out the same issues.
[01:16:41.219 --> 01:16:43.901]  Here's the way that I think Jeb Bush is selling this to Ted Cruz.
[01:16:45.236 --> 01:16:51.879]  I think what he's telling him is, look, you know, we have constructed this image of you as the second coming of Ronald Reagan.
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:56.262]  You're going to get the Christians and the conservatives like Ronald Reagan did.
[01:16:56.862 --> 01:17:06.467]  What I can do is I can bring you, Jeb will say, I can bring you the moderates in the GOP establishment just like my father did to Ronald Reagan, or we can oppose you and take you down.
[01:17:07.219 --> 01:17:08.880]  We can make you king or we can take you down.
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.520]  I think that's what's going on.
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:12.841]  I think that's what's happening with the Bush brothers.
[01:17:13.281 --> 01:17:16.902]  And of course an interesting comment from Ted Cruz about Florida.
[01:17:16.922 --> 01:17:18.603]  Well actually it wasn't from the Cruz campaign.
[01:17:18.963 --> 01:17:26.025]  It was by a super PAC that is supporting Ted Cruz and they are pulling out of Florida.
[01:17:26.606 --> 01:17:28.406]  They said they're not going to be running ads in Florida.
[01:17:28.426 --> 01:17:33.628]  They said we've done an analysis and it looks like Marco Rubio can lose there all by himself.
[01:17:34.605 --> 01:17:38.768]  Now, if Marco Rubio loses all by himself, it becomes very difficult for Trump to go forward.
[01:17:38.828 --> 01:17:48.014]  If John Kasich loses even in his home state, since he hasn't won anything anywhere at all, it becomes very difficult for him to move forward.
[01:17:48.354 --> 01:17:55.820]  This article, very interesting, Pat Caddell says, when Trump finds out that Kasich voted for NAFTA, Kasich will lose Ohio.
[01:17:56.903 --> 01:17:57.763]  You hear that, Donald?
[01:17:59.044 --> 01:18:00.184]  He voted for NAFTA.
[01:18:00.204 --> 01:18:23.030]  And of course, when I cut the piece talking to Bernie Sanders supporters about why, if Hillary Clinton becomes a nominee, they might really want to think about supporting Donald Trump rather than Hillary Clinton, pointing out that, look, on so many different issues, on opposing the Fed, on opposing the trade treaties for draconic capitalism, on opposing NAFTA,
[01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:27.193]  Most people on the left, Huffington Post, they understand.
[01:18:27.213 --> 01:18:28.093]  They did studies.
[01:18:28.153 --> 01:18:28.813]  They've looked at this.
[01:18:28.833 --> 01:18:31.934]  They've looked at the massive outflow of jobs.
[01:18:32.234 --> 01:18:39.356]  Now, of course, the leadership of the Democrat Party, like Hillary Clinton and the superdelegates, they want to see this go through.
[01:18:39.836 --> 01:18:43.197]  They want to run this through just like Ted Cruz's supporters.
[01:18:43.257 --> 01:18:45.918]  And Ted Cruz has written op-ed pieces as well.
[01:18:45.938 --> 01:18:46.958]  We're going to tell you about that.
[01:18:47.658 --> 01:18:48.819]  He wrote op-ed pieces.
[01:18:49.952 --> 01:18:54.617]  With Paul Ryan talking about how the TPP needed to be run through.
[01:18:54.637 --> 01:19:00.903]  And again, you may be a low information voter if you think that Ted Cruz is a constitutionalist.
[01:19:01.924 --> 01:19:09.752]  Over and beyond the eligibility issue, the very fact that he would subvert the Constitution in support of the TPA.
[01:19:09.772 --> 01:19:11.514]  He voted for it before he voted against it.
[01:19:12.653 --> 01:19:14.775]  When he voted against it, they didn't need his vote.
[01:19:14.936 --> 01:19:20.741]  But he had already written op-ed pieces with Paul Ryan saying how they needed to run through the TPP.
[01:19:21.442 --> 01:19:27.147]  That is why Senator Sessions did not endorse him, but endorsed Donald Trump.
[01:19:27.935 --> 01:19:32.518]  Because he understands he's the only one of all the senators who went through and looked at that.
[01:19:32.558 --> 01:19:37.962]  I was very disappointed that even Rand Paul did not go through and look at the TPP.
[01:19:37.982 --> 01:19:38.622]  He opposed it.
[01:19:38.983 --> 01:19:40.043]  Consistently opposed it.
[01:19:40.464 --> 01:19:42.245]  Opposed the TPA.
[01:19:42.885 --> 01:19:46.608]  But of course Ted Cruz is now telling us that he doesn't support it.
[01:19:47.348 --> 01:19:55.534]  When in fact he wrote op-ed pieces in support of it and saying that we're going to get rid of the constitutional process for approving treaties.
[01:19:55.674 --> 01:19:57.155]  Why would you have the TPA?
[01:19:57.735 --> 01:20:01.338]  So you can get this through because you know you don't have 67 senators.
[01:20:01.378 --> 01:20:02.379]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[01:22:09.706 --> 01:22:11.207]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:22:11.507 --> 01:22:12.788]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:22:13.168 --> 01:22:15.489]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:17.831]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.

[01:22:37.984 --> 01:22:40.725]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:22:41.045 --> 01:22:43.645]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:22:43.685 --> 01:22:44.105]  Croix River.
[01:22:44.425 --> 01:22:46.426]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:22:46.646 --> 01:22:49.366]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:22:49.606 --> 01:22:50.126]  His excuse?
[01:22:50.487 --> 01:22:51.567]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:22:51.827 --> 01:22:53.107]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:22:53.427 --> 01:22:58.928]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[01:22:59.188 --> 01:22:59.928]  Don't wait.

[01:24:18.988 --> 01:24:20.189]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:20.209 --> 01:24:20.709]  I'm David Knight.
[01:24:20.749 --> 01:24:26.173]  On this Friday, March 11, 2016, we're going to go back to some breaking news here.
[01:24:26.253 --> 01:24:33.077]  Before we do, I just want to let you know that we have Supermail Vitality back in stock at the Infowarslife.com store.
[01:24:33.678 --> 01:24:36.199]  Supermail Vitality is back after a limited run.
[01:24:36.239 --> 01:24:38.941]  Now is the time to get your bottle before it sells out once again.
[01:24:38.981 --> 01:24:39.601]  And you know what, folks?
[01:24:39.621 --> 01:24:44.605]  You can make sure that you don't run out of any of these products when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:24:45.365 --> 01:24:56.315]  That helps us to manage our inventory, to know what demand is going to be, and we want to make this a win-win situation for you, so we give you 10% discount whenever you sign up for these products on AutoShip.
[01:24:56.355 --> 01:25:03.461]  You determine the interval that you want to get the product at, and we give you the 10% discount, and it works well for both of us.
[01:25:03.481 --> 01:25:09.267]  And we have now in stock Supermail Vitality, also something that I rely on, and that is BrainForce.
[01:25:09.807 --> 01:25:13.589]  One of my favorite products that we have at the Infowarslife.com store.
[01:25:14.150 --> 01:25:16.451]  It is not like energy drinks or supplements.
[01:25:16.531 --> 01:25:21.514]  It uses natural brain activation ingredients like Yerba Mate extract and Alpha GPC.
[01:25:22.685 --> 01:25:26.726]  I drink coffee, but that is what really gets me going, is Brain Force.
[01:25:27.026 --> 01:25:39.251]  Again, Brain Force, we have Supermail Vitalities, many other items that ran out of stock with the large sale that we had going are now in stock, but never run out of stock on your products if you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:25:39.331 --> 01:25:42.632]  We will make sure that we have that available for you and give you a 10% discount.
[01:25:44.434 --> 01:25:55.039]  Now, as I was saying in the last segment, it's really bizarre we've now seen that Marco Rubio's campaign is urging supporters in Ohio to back John Kasich.
[01:25:55.879 --> 01:25:59.781]  He says, if you're a Republican primary voter in Ohio, you don't want Donald Trump to be the nominee.
[01:25:59.801 --> 01:26:01.181]  John Kasich is your best bet.
[01:26:02.842 --> 01:26:04.423]  That's really strange, okay?
[01:26:04.443 --> 01:26:12.046]  But maybe that was something that came out of the little secret meetings that John Kasich and Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio had with Jeb Bush.
[01:26:12.897 --> 01:26:16.822]  As I said, the brokered convention has already started, folks.
[01:26:16.842 --> 01:26:20.386]  You've got the Bush family that completely owns Ted Cruz.
[01:26:20.406 --> 01:26:22.008]  That's where his career began.
[01:26:22.508 --> 01:26:29.857]  We've got the Bushes now falling in line behind him, and they're doing their little Machiavellian gameplays here, telling people.
[01:26:29.877 --> 01:26:31.578]  But you know, I don't really think it's going to work out.
[01:26:32.659 --> 01:26:37.186]  You know, Rubio really doesn't have that much influence with people.
[01:26:37.786 --> 01:26:42.433]  And I think once they find out about John Kasich in Ohio, there's been...
[01:26:44.565 --> 01:26:56.153]  So many jobs lost to NAFTA in Ohio, and that's what's causing people who are Democrats, blue-collar workers, to re-register and cross over and vote for Donald Trump.
[01:26:56.774 --> 01:27:01.617]  Reagan had about 13% blue-collar Democrat voters who crossed over for him.
[01:27:01.677 --> 01:27:04.459]  Right now, for Donald Trump, it's about 10% that are doing that.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:16.131]  And as Pat Caddell, one of the pollsters, said on television, he said, hey, somebody should go back and do some research on John Kasich and see if he voted for NAFTA.
[01:27:16.151 --> 01:27:17.473]  He was in Congress at that time.
[01:27:18.095 --> 01:27:19.396]  I bet he voted for NAFTA.
[01:27:19.536 --> 01:27:25.259]  And he goes, boy, if he did, and Donald Trump gets a hold of that, it's over for John Kasich.
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:25.880]  Well, guess what?
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:27.821]  Breitbart carried the story.
[01:27:27.861 --> 01:27:34.405]  They went back, they looked at it, and they said, yeah, Kasich did, in fact, vote for NAFTA in 1993 while a congressman.
[01:27:34.925 --> 01:27:38.968]  During a January GOP debate as well, he declared, I'm a free trader.
[01:27:39.068 --> 01:27:41.810]  Let's understand, this is not about free trade, folks.
[01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:43.391]  This is about managed trade.
[01:27:44.111 --> 01:27:46.873]  If you had bothered to read the trade agreement,
[01:27:47.712 --> 01:27:59.583]  As Senator Sessions did and tried to explain to those who were in the Senate and voted to ram this thing through without any amendments, without any debate, without any kind of delay whatsoever.
[01:28:00.263 --> 01:28:05.288]  It has to go to the floor once it's sent by the President within a certain period of time.
[01:28:05.868 --> 01:28:09.949]  There can be no debate, no filibusters, nothing.
[01:28:10.009 --> 01:28:12.430]  It's going to be voted on within that certain period of time.
[01:28:13.230 --> 01:28:16.872]  And it doesn't need the 67 votes that a treaty needs to have.
[01:28:16.912 --> 01:28:19.192]  They've taken it down to a simple majority.
[01:28:20.353 --> 01:28:22.954]  If you'd bothered to look at this, you would know that it's not about free trade.
[01:28:22.994 --> 01:28:24.074]  It's about managed trade.
[01:28:24.878 --> 01:28:27.599]  These rules, as complicated as they are, are not going to apply.
[01:28:27.819 --> 01:28:30.581]  It is a living document, as Senator Sessions said.
[01:28:30.601 --> 01:28:36.283]  There will be an international commission that is not elected, not accountable to anybody in America.
[01:28:36.664 --> 01:28:38.945]  They will decide what the trade deals are going to be.
[01:28:39.265 --> 01:28:41.106]  That means that they manage our economy.
[01:28:41.886 --> 01:28:44.207]  And we have seen how this works out, haven't we?
[01:28:44.247 --> 01:28:45.008]  We were lied to.
[01:28:45.028 --> 01:28:47.589]  We were told that we're going to get a lot of jobs out of NAFTA.
[01:28:48.309 --> 01:28:49.670]  We lost a million jobs.
[01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:53.972]  We lost a trillion dollars in trade deficits just to Mexico.
[01:28:54.884 --> 01:29:00.889]  You look at these massive trade deficits that we've had with Mexico immediately after and continuing to increase.
[01:29:01.410 --> 01:29:03.472]  But then he goes on and he says, well, I supported NAFTA.
[01:29:03.692 --> 01:29:04.192]  He admitted it.
[01:29:04.393 --> 01:29:06.655]  Kasich did, back in January in the debate.
[01:29:07.055 --> 01:29:08.496]  He says, I believe in the PTT.
[01:29:08.536 --> 01:29:09.557]  The PTT.
[01:29:11.055 --> 01:29:13.536]  Now that's a low information candidate there.
[01:29:14.036 --> 01:29:16.057]  He doesn't even know that it's the TPP.
[01:29:16.597 --> 01:29:18.057]  He doesn't know enough about it.
[01:29:18.857 --> 01:29:20.178]  Maybe he just is ignorant.
[01:29:20.258 --> 01:29:24.239]  Maybe somebody told him that it's free trade and he thinks that free trade's a good idea.
[01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:25.679]  I think free trade's a good idea.
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.240]  Ron Paul said he likes free trade.
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:30.701]  Ron Paul said NAFTA's not free trade.
[01:29:31.872 --> 01:29:36.113]  You don't need thousands of pages of managed trade to have free trade.
[01:29:36.133 --> 01:29:37.173]  You just have a free market.
[01:29:37.673 --> 01:29:38.814]  What's it called, a free market?
[01:29:38.854 --> 01:29:40.194]  Yeah, I'm all for free markets.
[01:29:40.814 --> 01:29:42.534]  But I'm not for managed trade.
[01:29:43.034 --> 01:29:44.435]  And I'm not for being a sucker.
[01:29:45.015 --> 01:29:48.696]  And these guys have absolutely no idea what the China price is.
[01:29:48.816 --> 01:29:52.977]  When Donald Trump talks about manipulating currency, their eyes glaze over and they make fun of him.
[01:29:53.257 --> 01:29:54.157]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:29:58.277 --> 01:30:01.261]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.203 --> 01:30:04.886]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.173 --> 01:30:10.614]  Where do you go to leave your legacy?
[01:30:10.754 --> 01:30:13.897]  Well, if you're President Barack Obama, you go to South by Southwest.
[01:30:14.197 --> 01:30:14.678]  That's right.
[01:30:14.838 --> 01:30:23.605]  In addition to the 200,000 workers and guests and attendees who will be filling up the Austin downtown area, Barack Obama is going to show up with his giant Secret Service detail.
[01:30:23.845 --> 01:30:33.654]  Of course, in addition to tying up traffic, as Kit Daniels covered, even the Mayor of Austin is warning people to stay home on Friday as the President's visit is sure to tie up traffic for hours on end.
[01:30:33.894 --> 01:30:37.397]  He will also be utilizing state police and local police resources.
[01:30:37.557 --> 01:30:39.458]  Which could be used during South by Southwest.
[01:30:39.658 --> 01:30:40.918]  He'll be making two stops.
[01:30:41.218 --> 01:30:43.639]  One at the Long Center for Performing Arts to give a speech.
[01:30:43.879 --> 01:30:47.280]  And then jumping across the river to attend a fundraiser at Austin Music Hall.
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:52.421]  And then it's on to a private fundraiser at the home of Amy and Kirk Rudy, local developers here.
[01:30:52.661 --> 01:31:02.224]  It was Amy Rudy who approached a local Austin City Council member after he voted against awarding a $37 million tax rebate to her husband's company and said, don't F with my husband.
[01:31:02.364 --> 01:31:03.364]  And she repeated it twice.
[01:31:03.564 --> 01:31:05.546]  These are the kind of people Obama hangs out with.
[01:31:05.586 --> 01:31:08.409]  Rob Drew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:31:08.909 --> 01:31:11.872]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:31:12.132 --> 01:31:14.274]  Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:14.474 --> 01:31:21.201]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[01:31:21.501 --> 01:31:26.646]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[01:31:26.806 --> 01:31:35.954]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.

[01:33:30.931 --> 01:33:35.694]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.375 --> 01:33:39.577]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:39.597 --> 01:33:41.758]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Wednesday, March 11, 2016.
[01:33:41.818 --> 01:33:48.602]  I want to take some calls and see what you think about the news, about the election, about recent events.
[01:33:48.662 --> 01:33:53.765]  Perhaps you've got something to say about what happened in Oregon with the shooting of Roy Finnegan.
[01:33:53.785 --> 01:33:54.526]  We saw that video.
[01:33:55.606 --> 01:34:02.670]  Absolutely amazing to me that the government can continually, whether it's in the city or whether it's in the country, execute people.
[01:34:03.490 --> 01:34:06.112]  You get it on tape and they just get away with it.
[01:34:06.132 --> 01:34:10.494]  The only thing the FBI seems to be concerned about is they didn't report accurately the number of shots they took.
[01:34:11.772 --> 01:34:11.972]  Really?
[01:34:11.992 --> 01:34:22.262]  You murder a man, you attempt to murder three other people in a vehicle, and the only thing they're concerned about is accurately reporting the number of shots that were fired.
[01:34:22.963 --> 01:34:23.623]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:34:24.024 --> 01:34:24.504]  The number is 800-259-9231.
[01:34:24.524 --> 01:34:24.564]  800-259-9231.
[01:34:24.604 --> 01:34:26.266]  There is some good news coming out of New Hampshire.
[01:34:32.091 --> 01:34:35.993]  There's always good news coming out of New Hampshire, it seems like, if you believe in liberty.
[01:34:36.393 --> 01:34:46.737]  On March 10th, that's yesterday, the New Hampshire House of Representatives voted in favor of considering a measure codifying jury nullification as part of that state's criminal procedure.
[01:34:46.777 --> 01:34:52.880]  That is one of my favorite freedom things to do here, is jury nullification.
[01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:54.301]  We've got to get people to understand
[01:34:55.001 --> 01:34:56.322]  What jury nullification is about.
[01:34:56.823 --> 01:35:02.568]  We have to get people to understand what their right is as a juror, what their duty is as a juror.
[01:35:04.107 --> 01:35:05.849]  You know, Nancy Reagan's funeral is today.
[01:35:05.909 --> 01:35:07.370]  She was famous for just saying no.
[01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:10.553]  Well, you know, we need to just say no to government tyranny.
[01:35:10.573 --> 01:35:14.216]  And the best way we can do that is as a juror.
[01:35:14.697 --> 01:35:16.038]  That was what it was designed for.
[01:35:16.358 --> 01:35:19.982]  Now, in the past, they've had a movement in New Hampshire.
[01:35:20.582 --> 01:35:29.771]  They were successful in getting a law passed there that said that the judges could not punish lawyers for telling jurors about jury nullification because it's part of the law.
[01:35:30.922 --> 01:35:39.007]  I mean, jury nullification, not just telling them about it as part of the law, but that jury nullification itself is a long established legal tradition.
[01:35:39.347 --> 01:35:40.708]  It's what juries are there for.
[01:35:41.228 --> 01:35:43.650]  They're not there just to judge the facts of the case.
[01:35:43.710 --> 01:35:50.334]  As a matter of fact, in this article from the New American, they have a quote here from the very first Supreme Court Justice.
[01:35:50.894 --> 01:35:53.416]  He says, on questions of facts,
[01:35:54.096 --> 01:35:55.677]  That's the province of the jury.
[01:35:56.017 --> 01:35:58.558]  On questions of law, it's the province of the court.
[01:35:58.578 --> 01:36:00.159]  In other words, the judge to decide.
[01:36:00.239 --> 01:36:16.607]  But, he said, it must be observed that by the same law which recognizes a reasonable distribution of jurisdiction, you have nevertheless a right to take upon yourself to judge both, to determine the law as well as the fact in controversy.
[01:36:17.287 --> 01:36:20.789]  This is what the Supreme Court Justice told a jury.
[01:36:22.099 --> 01:36:22.259]  In 1794.
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:25.401]  And of course, that was the way all the founders understood this.
[01:36:25.802 --> 01:36:39.009]  And this article from the New American New Hampshire House to consider codifying jury nullification, they go through the long tradition of this, the quotes from people who were both Federalist and Anti-Federalist talking about how important this was.
[01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:42.191]  That is a long-standing tradition.
[01:36:42.251 --> 01:36:47.792]  At some point in time, our government decided they didn't want juries to know that they have that right.
[01:36:48.472 --> 01:36:52.073]  They wanted to lie to people and shut down jury nullification.
[01:36:52.794 --> 01:36:59.115]  They will try to keep you off of a jury if you are open about the fact that you believe in jury nullification.
[01:36:59.536 --> 01:37:04.117]  If you start talking about it as part of deliberations, they will remove you from the jury in many cases.
[01:37:04.857 --> 01:37:06.898]  There are some judges that won't do that, but most will.
[01:37:06.978 --> 01:37:11.199]  And if a lawyer talks about it for his defendant, they will try to disbar him.
[01:37:11.259 --> 01:37:14.140]  So they stopped that in the earlier law in New Hampshire.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:28.264]  Now this is a law that would mandate, quote, the court shall inform the jury of its right to judge the facts and the application of the law in relation to the facts and controversy.
[01:37:29.298 --> 01:37:41.381]  So, for example, you're going to send somebody to jail for a mandatory minimum of 10, 20 years because they had a small amount of pot that they were growing in their closet.
[01:37:42.821 --> 01:37:45.861]  Then the jury might look at that and say, you know, yeah, he was doing that.
[01:37:45.901 --> 01:37:46.802]  He wasn't hurting anybody.
[01:37:46.882 --> 01:37:48.322]  That's a ridiculous sentence.
[01:37:48.462 --> 01:37:52.763]  So we're going to find him not guilty just to make sure that this doesn't go through.
[01:37:53.576 --> 01:37:56.857]  And I think that's a very, very important thing for us to understand.
[01:37:56.897 --> 01:37:59.618]  We need to start this movement in other states as well.
[01:38:00.219 --> 01:38:10.663]  And of course, as I mentioned the other day, briefly, there is a move afoot in Arizona that would stop the enforcement of unconstitutional laws by state representatives.
[01:38:10.703 --> 01:38:15.185]  We've seen that introduced in another number of states, and that is something that needs to be propagated as well.
[01:38:15.425 --> 01:38:21.067]  There's a lot that we can do to cut off the tyranny of Washington besides elect a president.
[01:38:22.088 --> 01:38:35.831]  That's why I think it's, you know, when I look at the candidates that are there, Rand Paul had been very good in terms of explaining to people the libertarian point of view, to explain to people the importance of individual liberty, the importance of the Bill of Rights.
[01:38:35.992 --> 01:38:38.352]  We don't have a candidate that understands that.
[01:38:39.272 --> 01:38:47.094]  Ted Cruz says he does, and I don't believe that he does, because I've seen him move in too many ways, changing his statement.
[01:38:47.694 --> 01:38:48.815]  He used to say that he
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:54.001]  Supported Ed Snowden as an important whistleblower.
[01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:55.521]  Now he thinks he's a traitor.
[01:38:56.161 --> 01:38:57.341]  Implies he should be executed.
[01:38:57.381 --> 01:39:01.282]  And of course, his advisor, Woolsey, came out and said that.
[01:39:01.642 --> 01:39:14.264]  James Woolsey, who is his advisor, somebody who is a Clinton administration appointee to the CIA, somebody who is a leader in many neocon groups, has called for the execution of Ed Snowden.
[01:39:14.444 --> 01:39:17.025]  And he is a close advisor to Ted Cruz.
[01:39:17.385 --> 01:39:18.865]  So if you look at his advisors,
[01:39:19.705 --> 01:39:23.609]  As we pointed out, this is a Kurt Nemo story going back to February.
[01:39:23.629 --> 01:39:27.532]  The men behind Ted Cruz, neocons and a CIA propagandist.
[01:39:28.233 --> 01:39:32.456]  The way the New American put it, Ted Cruz's closest counselors are neocons.
[01:39:32.496 --> 01:39:36.239]  I would say maybe his closet counselors are neocons.
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:41.204]  So he pulls these guys in as his closest advisors.
[01:39:42.366 --> 01:39:46.916]  Keeping them under the carpet while he publicly trashes their policies.
[01:39:47.557 --> 01:39:52.708]  While he publicly trashes quote-unquote neocons, he brings in the leaders of the neocons.
[01:39:53.848 --> 01:39:54.108]  Okay?
[01:39:54.609 --> 01:39:57.010]  And that's the way he is on every issue.
[01:39:57.030 --> 01:40:01.713]  As Kurt Nemo summed up back in February, he said, Ted Cruz is not even remotely a libertarian.
[01:40:01.733 --> 01:40:05.436]  He is a neocon masquerading as a champion of liberty.
[01:40:05.936 --> 01:40:09.179]  If nominated and elected, he will continue the forever war agenda.
[01:40:09.519 --> 01:40:14.722]  It was initiated by the Bush regime, a regime that he was part of, folks, he and his wife.
[01:40:15.383 --> 01:40:20.987]  And he will further expand the high-tech surveillance police state, because he's doing that to his supporters right now.
[01:40:22.028 --> 01:40:27.151]  He profiles his supporters to a level of detail that nobody has ever done before.
[01:40:27.952 --> 01:40:30.413]  And then he tells them precisely what he knows they want to hear.
[01:40:31.214 --> 01:40:31.514]  Okay?
[01:40:32.014 --> 01:40:34.135]  And that's what he's going to do if he becomes president.
[01:40:34.416 --> 01:40:42.200]  Now there's another closet issue that kind of bears, I think, on the fact that Ben Carson endorsed Donald Trump today.
[01:40:43.301 --> 01:40:45.582]  And this was not too long ago.
[01:40:45.622 --> 01:40:49.905]  This was back in about a month ago, about February 19th this came out.
[01:40:51.209 --> 01:40:59.052]  As one of the debates was happening, Cruz and Carson held a secret meeting about Ted Cruz's dirty tricks in a closet.
[01:40:59.790 --> 01:41:04.854]  And the Daily Beast had a lot of fun with this, of course, because they're a Democrat publication.
[01:41:04.874 --> 01:41:07.756]  They said, two grown men running for president met in a storage closet last night.
[01:41:07.776 --> 01:41:18.685]  The two huddled in the unusual venue for nearly 20 to 25 minutes as Secret Service stood outside, according to a Republican operative who witnessed the strange scene.
[01:41:19.025 --> 01:41:23.849]  This was Ted Cruz trying to explain to Ben Carson
[01:41:24.910 --> 01:41:28.732]  Why they lied about him in Iowa, in the Iowa caucus.
[01:41:28.752 --> 01:41:30.033]  I mean, everybody knows the story.
[01:41:30.874 --> 01:41:35.817]  Except that most people don't know the true story about the time sequence that was there.
[01:41:36.857 --> 01:41:45.923]  You see, not only did they say that Ben Carson was dropping out in the caucuses, what they said afterwards was, well, who knew?
[01:41:45.943 --> 01:41:56.271]  I mean, there was this CNN article that came out, they tweeted about it, and it really wasn't clear, so, you know, we were just mistaken, after they had been doing that for an hour.
[01:41:57.222 --> 01:42:11.988]  In reality, the tweet that they were referring to that they used to propagate this lie, to stab Ben Carson in the back in Iowa, where he had the best chance to get off the ground, they squashed him before he got off the ground, that was about 20 minutes before the caucuses started.
[01:42:12.588 --> 01:42:14.009]  And it was immediately tweeted out.
[01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:26.640]  By the CNN reporter who did it, he said, and oh by the way, yeah, he is going to Florida, he's not sticking around, but he made it clear that he's going back, although he's going back to his home, he is not dropping out of the race no matter what the outcome is.
[01:42:27.421 --> 01:42:32.465]  And those came out virtually simultaneously, 20 minutes before the caucus began.
[01:42:32.485 --> 01:42:40.312]  And then the Ted Cruz people, who want to tell us that they are the face of God to America.
[01:42:42.475 --> 01:42:46.919]  See, that's the other thing that concerns me about him, and that is the public display of piety.
[01:42:46.939 --> 01:43:01.212]  And of course, there's a lot of articles that are linked at the top of the Drudge Report about this, how they believe that he is the one who is anointed, that God has spoken to him through the Holy Spirit, telling them that he is going to be the next President of the United States.
[01:43:02.165 --> 01:43:07.074]  And then I saw this article in the Daily Mail, and I thought at first maybe it was about Ted Cruz.
[01:43:07.234 --> 01:43:15.809]  A Christian prophet has his buttocks mauled by a lion after running toward a pride to prove the Lord's power over animals during a South African safari.
[01:43:17.697 --> 01:43:22.518]  Maybe Ted Cruz is about to get his buttocks mauled in this next election on Tuesday.
[01:43:23.139 --> 01:43:39.743]  In this particular case, this is literally what happens, and this is why, as Christians, we need to, when we start thinking that we're getting guidance from God, we need to kind of check and see if that little voice that we hear isn't our pride telling us something.
[01:43:40.283 --> 01:43:45.365]  In this particular case, they say a church leader had his buttocks mauled by a lion after running toward a pride.
[01:43:46.311 --> 01:43:47.072]  How's that for irony?
[01:43:47.092 --> 01:43:48.093]  A little bit of pride there.
[01:43:48.593 --> 01:43:55.579]  In a bid to prove the Lord's power over animals, he's said to have fallen into a trance, started speaking in tongues before charging at a pride of lions.
[01:43:56.219 --> 01:44:01.644]  Feeding on an impala, he said as he sprinted toward them, the lions immediately viewed him as prey.
[01:44:02.264 --> 01:44:04.526]  And they zeroed in on him, realizing his mistake.
[01:44:06.088 --> 01:44:10.712]  He turned his back and ran back toward the car, but not before one of the lions clamped down on his buttocks.
[01:44:11.963 --> 01:44:22.688]  And looking back on this, looking back on the lion pride, looking back on his pride, and how his prayers turned him into prey, he said, I do not know what came over me.
[01:44:22.788 --> 01:44:26.690]  I thought the Lord wanted me, wanted to use me to show his power over animals.
[01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:30.092]  Is it not that we were given dominion over all the creatures of the earth?
[01:44:30.172 --> 01:44:36.155]  Well, take a look at Genesis 3, Pastor, and you'll understand what happened with the fall.
[01:44:37.055 --> 01:44:51.400]  And I would guess, when you look at these articles at the top of the Drudge Report, that maybe Ted Cruz is looking at what's going on and he's saying, uh, is this, uh, was I not anointed and given power to have dominion over America?
[01:44:52.041 --> 01:44:52.921]  Like, maybe not, Ted.
[01:44:53.381 --> 01:44:53.801]  Maybe not.
[01:44:53.901 --> 01:44:54.942]  Maybe it's not your time.
[01:44:55.222 --> 01:44:56.202]  Maybe you're misreading that.
[01:44:56.762 --> 01:44:58.923]  Maybe that's your own interpretation.
[01:44:59.323 --> 01:45:01.144]  Let's go to Frank in North Carolina.
[01:45:01.164 --> 01:45:01.424]  Frank.
[01:45:04.265 --> 01:45:05.046]  Hey, David.
[01:45:05.126 --> 01:45:06.086]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:45:06.713 --> 01:45:08.714]  Hey, I'm gonna ask this question.
[01:45:09.054 --> 01:45:09.854]  This is serious.
[01:45:09.975 --> 01:45:13.176]  It's not tongue-in-cheek.
[01:45:13.216 --> 01:45:18.999]  I've been thinking that someone maybe needs to put forth the question to Donald Trump.
[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:30.384]  How should his supporters respond in the event of his untimely demise?
[01:45:32.124 --> 01:45:33.005]  Should it be under
[01:45:34.236 --> 01:45:42.201]  If it were to happen, and it's obviously under questionable, suspicious circumstances, I would like to see him respond to that.
[01:45:42.721 --> 01:45:46.863]  You're talking about a hornet's nest out here.
[01:45:49.142 --> 01:45:51.864]  Well, you know, I would like to see him answer that.
[01:45:52.284 --> 01:45:57.067]  Well, you know, Washington and government in general is a mafia.
[01:45:57.107 --> 01:46:02.731]  I mean, we just had the former, the founder of RT, beaten to death in Washington.
[01:46:02.871 --> 01:46:09.175]  Suspicion falls upon the Russian government, perhaps, because he used to be an ally of Putin, now he's a critic of Putin.
[01:46:09.775 --> 01:46:16.260]  You know, the bottom line is, at its very best, even if the government is not shooting at citizens down in the streets like little boy Finnegan,
[01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:19.141]  Uh, they are still a protection racket.
[01:46:19.922 --> 01:46:26.826]  In the sense that they come to you and they say, you know what, pay me some money and nothing bad will happen to you.
[01:46:26.846 --> 01:46:31.929]  You know, I wouldn't want you to have some kind of an accident, you know, like the guys, the mafia shakes down people in the restaurant, you know.
[01:46:31.949 --> 01:46:35.491]  It would be a shame if something were to happen to this nice place, okay?
[01:46:36.111 --> 01:46:37.912]  They're not that tactful about it.
[01:46:38.272 --> 01:46:40.554]  They just get in your face and threaten you.
[01:46:40.634 --> 01:46:45.957]  So basically, they're taking your money, they're saying that you need to be protected, but the reality is that
[01:46:46.590 --> 01:46:48.252]  The biggest threat to you is the government.
[01:46:48.312 --> 01:46:50.474]  It's not some kind of a foreign boogeyman.
[01:46:51.075 --> 01:46:53.137]  It's your own government that's most likely to kill you.
[01:46:53.357 --> 01:46:56.240]  And yeah, we have seen that multiple times.
[01:46:56.300 --> 01:47:03.428]  We have had many people that have been on the show that Alex has talked to, the DC Madam, Gary Webb, who then...
[01:47:04.713 --> 01:47:10.214]  We were told committed suicide and in all these cases they had absolutely no reason to commit suicide.
[01:47:10.254 --> 01:47:12.135]  They were in a great frame of mind.
[01:47:12.555 --> 01:47:20.957]  They even said no, Alex even asked the DC Madam, and I believe maybe Gary Webb as well, you know, you're not planning on committing suicide are you?
[01:47:21.017 --> 01:47:21.617]  Make sure you get there.
[01:47:21.657 --> 01:47:22.777]  No man, I'm feeling great.
[01:47:22.837 --> 01:47:25.878]  Things are turning, you know, I've got a lot of stuff in the fire.
[01:47:26.958 --> 01:47:30.519]  Everything is looking good and then in a couple of days they are
[01:47:32.463 --> 01:47:32.985]  Suicided.
[01:47:33.566 --> 01:47:35.651]  So I don't know really what he would do.
[01:47:35.671 --> 01:47:41.545]  I think that he doesn't want to probably respond to that because remember that didn't work out too well for Ross Perot.
[01:47:42.462 --> 01:47:47.966]  People portrayed him as paranoid and afraid of the Bushes.
[01:47:48.926 --> 01:47:53.289]  You know, if there's somebody to be afraid of, you would want to be afraid of the Bushes.
[01:47:53.329 --> 01:47:55.391]  Remember George Bush going like this, okay?
[01:47:55.891 --> 01:48:00.214]  Isn't it interesting that he said that he was threatened by George Bush.
[01:48:00.254 --> 01:48:01.135]  He dropped out for a while.
[01:48:01.155 --> 01:48:02.716]  He said, they threatened me, threatened my family.
[01:48:03.956 --> 01:48:05.557]  Everybody poo-pooed that idea.
[01:48:06.298 --> 01:48:08.740]  We know a lot more about the Bushes now than we did then, don't we?
[01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:10.621]  Let's go to Laura in Montana.
[01:48:10.641 --> 01:48:10.801]  Laura?
[01:48:12.847 --> 01:48:13.847]  Hi, David.
[01:48:14.547 --> 01:48:16.848]  I was aghast last night.
[01:48:16.908 --> 01:48:24.169]  My husband and I looked at each other when Kasich started talking about Ukraine and boots on the ground and helping Ukrainians.
[01:48:24.809 --> 01:48:39.692]  You know, he knows absolutely nothing about what happened in Ukraine and Russia, the MH17, you name it, and even including Victoria Nuland's famous leaked audio tape with Jeffrey Pyatt.
[01:48:40.399 --> 01:48:46.807]  The US ambassador to Ukraine talking about who she was going to put in as president.
[01:48:46.907 --> 01:48:49.230]  Is it going to be Klitschko or Yatsenyuk?
[01:48:49.571 --> 01:48:56.700]  You know, this is really the tailmark indication of the United States' involvement in Ukraine.
[01:48:57.020 --> 01:48:57.540]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:48:57.581 --> 01:48:58.341]  I agree with you, Laura.
[01:48:58.421 --> 01:49:08.309]  And when you look at all these people, that's why I say to people, look, there isn't any other candidate out there other than Donald Trump who is pushing back against the neocons.
[01:49:08.449 --> 01:49:10.550]  They have all aligned against him.
[01:49:10.891 --> 01:49:14.834]  They have to stop him at any expense.
[01:49:15.414 --> 01:49:18.717]  And it's the people like you just mentioned, John Kasich, but Marco Rubio is the same way.
[01:49:18.757 --> 01:49:20.098]  Ted Cruz is the same way.
[01:49:20.418 --> 01:49:26.203]  They all want to put us into every conflict and initiate these conflicts as they did in Ukraine.
[01:49:26.423 --> 01:49:26.683]  Go ahead.
[01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:30.961]  Like he said about TTP or TTT.
[01:49:31.221 --> 01:49:32.502]  He didn't even know what that was.
[01:49:32.882 --> 01:49:39.004]  I just can't believe we have somebody running for president who knows nothing about all these incidents.
[01:49:39.124 --> 01:49:40.805]  It's just shocking to me.
[01:49:42.406 --> 01:49:46.227]  I do thank you for all the work you do, David.
[01:49:46.307 --> 01:49:48.088]  You are such an asset.
[01:49:48.773 --> 01:49:52.976]  I wish you could be an advisor to Donald Trump.
[01:49:53.817 --> 01:49:54.577]  Well, thanks.
[01:49:54.597 --> 01:49:55.838]  He's got some good advisors.
[01:49:55.998 --> 01:49:56.699]  You know what?
[01:49:56.779 --> 01:49:58.120]  He's got Senator Sessions.
[01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:01.842]  And Senator Sessions knows what's going on.
[01:50:01.982 --> 01:50:03.023]  He knows what's going on.
[01:50:03.543 --> 01:50:05.325]  This is not about trade.
[01:50:05.585 --> 01:50:09.768]  This is about managing our economy and it is about destroying our sovereignty.
[01:50:10.368 --> 01:50:14.411]  Senator Sessions understands that and I hope that he has Donald Trump's ear.
[01:50:14.791 --> 01:50:17.153]  Because there's going to be all kinds of people who are going to come to him.
[01:50:17.173 --> 01:50:19.734]  They're going to be people from the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:50:19.814 --> 01:50:25.258]  And there's, you know, we've got, however, people from the CFR that are already counselors to Ted Cruz.
[01:50:25.718 --> 01:50:37.046]  So as they're trashing Donald Trump, people like Max Boot and others from the CFR, as they're trashing him, the leader of the CFR, Robert Haass, tries to come to him to play good cop.
[01:50:37.446 --> 01:50:39.968]  Okay, so you got good cop, bad cop being played by the CFR.
[01:50:40.729 --> 01:50:45.713]  Ronald Reagan was the first president we had that, after the CFR was created, that was not a member of the CFR.
[01:50:45.733 --> 01:50:50.898]  But then he put 350, 60 CFR people in the State Department.
[01:50:50.938 --> 01:50:52.099]  They wound up controlling it.
[01:50:52.159 --> 01:50:53.200]  So they have their ways.
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:58.044]  And that's something I hope Donald Trump is wise about that if he becomes president.
[01:50:58.565 --> 01:51:02.448]  He needs to listen to the solid people like Senator Sessions.
[01:51:02.508 --> 01:51:02.908]  Stay with us.
[01:51:02.928 --> 01:51:04.390]  We'll be right back with more of your calls.

[01:54:19.215 --> 01:54:20.536]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:20.556 --> 01:54:21.637]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[01:54:21.717 --> 01:54:23.459]  We're going to be joined in the next hour.
[01:54:23.959 --> 01:54:27.442]  We have an interview with Mitch Firestein.
[01:54:27.542 --> 01:54:30.385]  He is the author of Planet Ponzi.
[01:54:30.405 --> 01:54:32.727]  He also has a Planet Ponzi website.
[01:54:33.527 --> 01:54:37.331]  We're going to talk to you about the biggest Ponzi scheme ever.
[01:54:38.302 --> 01:54:45.367]  Remember there was the original Ponzi scheme and then there were things like the bank pump-and-dump bailouts we've had.
[01:54:45.887 --> 01:54:47.288]  But of course there are others as well.
[01:54:47.488 --> 01:54:50.490]  When I think of Ponzi schemes, the first thing I think of is Social Security.
[01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:56.434]  But we're going to be talking to the author, the expert on Ponzi schemes, Mitchell Feierstein.
[01:54:56.474 --> 01:54:58.535]  He's going to be with us in the next hour.
[01:54:58.616 --> 01:55:00.016]  But right now we're taking your calls.
[01:55:00.057 --> 01:55:04.319]  Before I go back to your calls real quickly, I just want to let you know that we have Brain Force in stock.
[01:55:04.379 --> 01:55:07.962]  We also now have back in stock Supermail Vitality.
[01:55:08.862 --> 01:55:10.404]  We run out of things constantly.
[01:55:10.464 --> 01:55:13.587]  Now is the time, while these items are in, to stock up on them.
[01:55:13.827 --> 01:55:27.819]  And also, think about, if you use our products, if you take a look at the reviews that are there, and we have thousands of interviews over the various products, you can take a look at what other people are using these products for, how they rate them, what they say they have helped them to do.
[01:55:28.559 --> 01:55:34.464]  And if you're looking at these things and trying them out, now is a good time to get brain force.
[01:55:35.561 --> 01:55:35.841]  Yes, David.
[01:56:04.989 --> 01:56:18.917]  Reporting on the Bundy and Finnegan, especially yesterday, was so emotionally deep that it resonated right through.
[01:56:18.957 --> 01:56:21.098]  I congratulate you on what you're doing there.
[01:56:21.858 --> 01:56:22.779]  Well, thank you.
[01:56:23.799 --> 01:56:27.862]  What I'm concerned about is the fact that people can look at this and not be concerned about it.
[01:56:27.922 --> 01:56:29.523]  That people cannot report on this.
[01:56:30.163 --> 01:56:33.705]  And it bothers me on so many different levels, the idea that the government
[01:56:34.713 --> 01:57:02.909]  would first put out a video that was a deliberate attempt to deceive people and then as this incredibly powerful video of the cell phone inside the car comes out and people can see what's really going on that the mainstream media would not be interested in covering this and we have to get the word out unless we have a large number of the American public who are concerned about this see what has happened
[01:57:03.863 --> 01:57:04.864]  Nothing is going to change.
[01:57:05.464 --> 01:57:08.445]  One or two of us who are upset about this, it's not going to change anything.
[01:57:08.526 --> 01:57:11.407]  We have to get everyone to understand what's going on.
[01:57:11.427 --> 01:57:14.949]  And we have to understand that there are other things too, like jury nullification.
[01:57:15.009 --> 01:57:24.854]  I mean, the jurors in these cases where these guys are coming up, they need to understand that Clive and Bundy, A, nothing in the criminal complaint that I read was true about Clive and Bundy.
[01:57:24.974 --> 01:57:26.955]  It was a pack of lies.
[01:57:27.015 --> 01:57:29.136]  But they're going to try to send this guy to jail for 43 years.
[01:57:30.862 --> 01:57:40.605]  Even if he had told people, let's have this demonstration, I want you to help me try to get my cattle back, even if he had done that, conspiracy, okay?
[01:57:40.826 --> 01:57:42.706]  He doesn't deserve 43 years in jail.
[01:57:42.746 --> 01:57:45.067]  That's where, as a juror, you say, no, we're not going to do it.
[01:57:45.087 --> 01:57:46.347]  I'm sorry, I won't let you talk.
[01:57:46.367 --> 01:57:48.268]  Go ahead, Uncle Sam, tell us what you wanted to say.
[01:57:49.229 --> 01:57:50.109]  Yeah, sorry.

[01:57:53.965 --> 01:57:54.565]  We're good to go.
[01:58:13.467 --> 01:58:21.773]  EMT on 9-11, the day of 9-11, who stopped by my booth and gave me some testimony that you guys really should look into.
[01:58:22.434 --> 01:58:31.860]  If you go to YouTube, EMT 9-11 whistleblower hyphenated, you'll see this woman's testimony.
[01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:39.846]  She does have pictures, and so does her colleagues, that have never been seen before, of the vehicles that were blowing up
[01:58:41.282 --> 01:58:42.163]  All by themselves.
[01:58:42.503 --> 01:58:43.384]  Hey, we're out of time.
[01:58:43.464 --> 01:58:44.124]  Thank you so much.

[02:00:39.917 --> 02:00:42.878]  And in the next segment, we're going to be talking to Mitchell Feierstein.
[02:00:43.379 --> 02:00:45.740]  He is a highly successful hedge fund manager.
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:49.963]  He wrote a book called Planet Ponzi, also has a website of the same name.
[02:00:50.523 --> 02:00:53.224]  How Politicians and Bankers Stole Your Future.
[02:00:53.665 --> 02:00:54.585]  And what happens next?
[02:00:54.905 --> 02:00:56.186]  How You Can Survive.
[02:00:56.206 --> 02:00:59.748]  So we're going to be talking to Mitchell Feierstein in the next sequence.
[02:00:59.808 --> 02:01:00.389]  Let's talk to
[02:01:01.289 --> 02:01:03.291]  Jeremiah in California, you're up next.
[02:01:03.311 --> 02:01:03.992]  Jeremiah, go ahead.
[02:01:05.553 --> 02:01:13.381]  Hey, I was calling about the debate last night, and I think that over the last week we've really seen, you know, the liberty movement
[02:01:13.979 --> 02:01:14.099]  Yes.
[02:01:14.159 --> 02:01:14.239]  Yes.
[02:01:38.010 --> 02:01:40.712]  Uh, what has gone on in Oregon, like your last caller brought up.
[02:01:41.192 --> 02:01:49.417]  I absolutely have been floored, David Knight, that you have the audacity to call Pete Santilli a shill, even if you don't like his reporting.
[02:01:49.558 --> 02:01:54.240]  I can't believe that you would do this instead of backing a media journalist in jail.
[02:01:54.761 --> 02:01:55.741]  I mean, what are you doing?
[02:01:55.781 --> 02:01:56.602]  Why would you do that?
[02:01:56.822 --> 02:01:57.823]  Is it a competitive thing?
[02:01:58.850 --> 02:02:03.595]  No, actually, we did it because he was the one who encouraged them to go there.
[02:02:04.096 --> 02:02:08.580]  He had an involvement that went far beyond being simply a journalist.
[02:02:09.221 --> 02:02:12.824]  And if you don't understand that, I was at the Bundy standoff.
[02:02:14.806 --> 02:02:15.947]  I was there at Bunkerville.
[02:02:16.047 --> 02:02:16.988]  I know what happened there.
[02:02:17.028 --> 02:02:20.730]  Go listen to the recording that he had with Dan Love.
[02:02:21.670 --> 02:02:23.611]  He basically puts himself in charge.
[02:02:23.991 --> 02:02:30.075]  So he'd be basically... I think he created this whole situation to a large degree.
[02:02:30.195 --> 02:02:31.416]  That's my personal opinion.
[02:02:32.016 --> 02:02:32.276]  Okay?
[02:02:32.316 --> 02:02:32.997]  I think that he...
[02:02:33.857 --> 02:02:38.400]  Presented himself in a very unwise situation there, but that's you disagree with me.
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:42.143]  That's fine Yeah, he does do some journalism occasionally.
[02:02:42.943 --> 02:02:49.808]  Let's talk to Al in Oregon Al go ahead Al you there?
[02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:51.649]  Hello, Al
[02:02:53.314 --> 02:02:54.215]  Okay, he's not there.
[02:02:54.895 --> 02:03:02.259]  You know, one of the things, we're talking about the debates and I do agree with Jeremiah in California that, you know, we've seen the mask come off of Ted Cruz.
[02:03:02.299 --> 02:03:03.780]  We understand where he is.
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:09.863]  I think from the very beginning, he was there to take the Libertarian vote that would have gone to Rand Paul.
[02:03:10.424 --> 02:03:12.125]  He presented himself as somebody who
[02:03:13.146 --> 02:03:31.163]  Stood for individual rights, who stood for the Constitution, and now we're seeing what happens as we see the people lining up behind him who have pushed a forever war, who have pushed the police and surveillance state, who have called Ed Snowden a traitor, who say that he ought to be executed, and of course they repeat that he should be executed.
[02:03:32.043 --> 02:03:34.265]  It was repeated by Ted Cruz.
[02:03:35.208 --> 02:03:36.348]  Now we see who he is.
[02:03:36.888 --> 02:03:38.509]  We see the bankers lining up behind him.
[02:03:38.529 --> 02:03:43.530]  We see the massive number of donors quietly aligning behind him.
[02:03:44.170 --> 02:03:52.652]  Wealthy investors, as we pointed out before, we've read this article too, shooting skeet with him in Park City, Utah, meeting with him in a clubby restaurant in Washington.
[02:03:53.193 --> 02:03:59.914]  This is a guy who has nearly as much in terms of financial backers from Wall Street as Marco Rubio does.
[02:04:00.735 --> 02:04:01.535]  And they were the
[02:04:02.535 --> 02:04:05.416]  Co-heirs to the Sheldon Adelson primary.
[02:04:05.456 --> 02:04:09.817]  Sheldon Adelson couldn't really make up his mind whether he wanted to go with Margot Rubio or Ted Cruz.
[02:04:09.837 --> 02:04:11.198]  I should have told you something right there.
[02:04:12.358 --> 02:04:18.861]  He is the guy who is out front for the neocons and he is not a conservative.
[02:04:18.981 --> 02:04:25.543]  I think when I look at the public displays of piety and then what he does to people like
[02:04:26.812 --> 02:04:32.495]  Ben Carson in the Iowa caucus, even what he said about Marco Rubio putting out that fake video.
[02:04:32.515 --> 02:04:38.519]  Yeah, there's no answers in that book saying that Marco Rubio trolled his dad by pointing to the Bible and saying there's no answers in that book.
[02:04:38.559 --> 02:04:39.719]  We see that over and over again.
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:45.663]  Also, telling and trolling Donald Trump for saying two Corinthians.
[02:04:45.723 --> 02:04:51.586]  I mean, the message to me is that, hey, if you're a low-information Christian, you're not welcome at church.
[02:04:52.694 --> 02:04:54.215]  We don't need to be sending that message out.
[02:04:54.255 --> 02:05:04.199]  We need to be sending out a message of charity, and that is what we've seen in Ben Carson, and I think he cannot get over the hypocrisy that he saw in Ted Cruz.
[02:05:04.239 --> 02:05:04.660]  Stay with us.
[02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:07.501]  When we come back, we'll be talking to Mitchell Firesign.
[02:05:09.008 --> 02:05:10.449]  Where do you go to leave your legacy?
[02:05:10.589 --> 02:05:13.730]  Well, if you're President Barack Obama, you go to South by Southwest.
[02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:14.510]  That's right.
[02:05:14.670 --> 02:05:23.433]  In addition to the 200,000 workers and guests and attendees who will be filling up the Austin downtown area, Barack Obama is going to show up with his giant Secret Service detail.
[02:05:23.673 --> 02:05:33.477]  Of course, in addition to tying up traffic, as Kit Daniels covered, even the Mayor of Austin is warning people to stay home on Friday as the President's visit is sure to tie up traffic for hours on end.
[02:05:33.717 --> 02:05:37.218]  He will also be utilizing state police and local police resources.
[02:05:37.398 --> 02:05:39.299]  Which could be used during South by Southwest.
[02:05:39.499 --> 02:05:40.760]  He'll be making two stops.
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:43.461]  One at the Long Center for Performing Arts to give a speech.
[02:05:43.701 --> 02:05:47.122]  And then jumping across the river to attend a fundraiser at Austin Music Hall.
[02:05:47.323 --> 02:05:52.265]  And then it's on to a private fundraiser at the home of Amy and Kirk Rudy, local developers here.
[02:05:52.485 --> 02:06:02.069]  It was Amy Rudy who approached a local Austin City Council member after he voted against awarding a $37 million tax rebate to her husband's company and said, don't F with my husband.
[02:06:02.189 --> 02:06:03.190]  And she repeated it twice.
[02:06:03.390 --> 02:06:05.151]  These are the kind of people Obama hangs out with.
[02:06:05.411 --> 02:06:08.232]  Rob Dewey reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:06:08.692 --> 02:06:09.552]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:06:09.653 --> 02:06:10.073]  Good, brother.
[02:06:10.233 --> 02:06:11.893]  You just recently started using your products.
[02:06:11.933 --> 02:06:13.714]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:06:13.894 --> 02:06:17.916]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:06:17.936 --> 02:06:20.497]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:06:20.537 --> 02:06:22.818]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:06:22.958 --> 02:06:30.921]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:06:31.021 --> 02:06:34.244]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:06:34.364 --> 02:06:35.866]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:06:35.906 --> 02:06:38.829]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:06:38.949 --> 02:06:40.310]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:06:40.590 --> 02:06:43.093]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[02:06:43.333 --> 02:06:46.396]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[02:06:46.656 --> 02:06:48.257]  Or maximum potency.
[02:06:48.457 --> 02:06:58.625]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[02:06:58.665 --> 02:07:00.406]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[02:07:00.446 --> 02:07:07.391]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:07:09.975 --> 02:07:13.397]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:07:13.758 --> 02:07:20.882]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:07:21.483 --> 02:07:29.828]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:07:30.129 --> 02:07:34.211]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:07:34.512 --> 02:07:39.675]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[02:07:39.735 --> 02:07:40.455]  We're good to go.
[02:08:23.770 --> 02:08:38.517]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:38.557 --> 02:08:39.677]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[02:08:39.737 --> 02:08:45.600]  We're going to be talking to Mitchell Feierstein about his book and website called Planet Ponzi.
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:47.521]  He's coming up in just a moment.
[02:08:47.561 --> 02:08:52.683]  He is a highly successful hedge fund manager, CEO of the Glacial Environmental Fund Limited.
[02:08:53.844 --> 02:08:57.066]  And so we're going to talk to him about his book, Planet Ponzi.
[02:08:57.106 --> 02:08:58.247]  What is a Ponzi scheme?
[02:08:58.427 --> 02:09:02.971]  And define the giant Ponzi scheme that we're all right in the middle of right now.
[02:09:03.011 --> 02:09:06.313]  Before we go to him, real quickly, there's a breaking story that's up on the Drudge Report.
[02:09:06.353 --> 02:09:11.858]  Clinton IT specialist revealing server details to FBI is a devastating witness.
[02:09:12.678 --> 02:09:31.623]  And this is the man, we mentioned this the other day, Judge Napolitano talked about it, Brian Pagliano, he is the IT specialist who set up the server and as Judge Napolitano pointed out, he said they're going to be talking to him about whose idea it was to set up this conspiracy to evade the restrictions on classified documents.
[02:09:32.123 --> 02:09:36.004]  They point out, they say Brian Pagliano is a devastating witness.
[02:09:36.824 --> 02:09:42.808]  And, as the webmaster, he knows exactly who had access to Clinton's computer and devices at specific times.
[02:09:43.308 --> 02:09:48.272]  His importance to this case cannot be overemphasized, said an anonymous intelligence source.
[02:09:48.852 --> 02:09:50.713]  So, that's going to be very interesting.
[02:09:50.733 --> 02:09:56.277]  Of course, the key thing about it, which is what Judge Napolitano was talking about, was that they granted him immunity.
[02:09:56.917 --> 02:09:57.718]  He took the Fifth Amendment.
[02:09:57.738 --> 02:09:59.078]  He said, I'm not going to talk about this.
[02:10:00.139 --> 02:10:01.000]  And they said, guess what?
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:03.481]  We'll give you immunity to get you to talk.
[02:10:03.541 --> 02:10:04.702]  You don't do that.
[02:10:04.762 --> 02:10:09.224]  We've had multiple prosecutors at high levels talking about this.
[02:10:09.244 --> 02:10:09.925]  And it's common sense.
[02:10:09.945 --> 02:10:15.068]  You don't give immunity to somebody at a low level unless you want to get information on somebody that's higher up.
[02:10:15.088 --> 02:10:17.049]  The question is, how far up do they want to go?
[02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:19.891]  Ultimately, that buck stops with Hillary Clinton herself.
[02:10:20.603 --> 02:10:22.630]  Interesting new development in that story.
[02:10:22.991 --> 02:10:25.460]  Let's go now to our guest, Mitchell Firesign.
[02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:26.824]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Firesign.
[02:10:27.915 --> 02:10:29.056]  Thanks for having me here today.
[02:10:29.516 --> 02:10:31.777]  Tell us, first of all, about Ponzi schemes.
[02:10:31.817 --> 02:10:33.218]  We all hear the term.
[02:10:33.238 --> 02:10:35.459]  Many of us know what a Ponzi scheme is.
[02:10:35.519 --> 02:10:38.881]  Tell us a little bit about your definition of a Ponzi scheme and how it came about.
[02:10:38.901 --> 02:10:56.332]  Well, what's important is the book that I've written is the best descriptor of the global Ponzi scheme is Planet Ponzi, because what we have are governments around the world that think that they can, by printing money and executing these schemes like quantitative easing,
[02:10:57.052 --> 02:11:05.476]  And asset purchases, they can reinflate the economies of the world and create jobs by printing hundreds of trillions of dollars.
[02:11:06.017 --> 02:11:07.858]  Now, this is an utter failure.
[02:11:08.018 --> 02:11:08.918]  It's been a failure.
[02:11:09.258 --> 02:11:12.420]  And this is you can't pay your way out of debt with borrowed money.
[02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:16.402]  And my book goes through line by line what the governments have done.
[02:11:16.842 --> 02:11:21.945]  And it examines actually using the government's own data, the problems that they've created.
[02:11:22.025 --> 02:11:26.147]  So what they've done is basically made the problems exponentially worse by money printing.
[02:11:26.687 --> 02:11:29.089]  You know, you can see we've got the central banks.
[02:11:29.249 --> 02:11:31.630]  In the United States, we've got the United U.S.
[02:11:31.690 --> 02:11:32.551]  Federal Reserve.
[02:11:32.991 --> 02:11:35.193]  In Europe, we've got the European Central Bank.
[02:11:35.673 --> 02:11:37.474]  And in Japan, we've got Bank of Japan.
[02:11:37.514 --> 02:11:39.155]  And in England, we've got the Bank of England.
[02:11:39.375 --> 02:11:44.999]  All of them have increased the total amount of debt, the sum, exponentially.
[02:11:45.019 --> 02:11:47.581]  You know, they'll tell you that the deficit's decreased.
[02:11:47.961 --> 02:11:50.422]  But to give you a picture as to what that means,
[02:11:51.383 --> 02:11:57.729]  And the listeners, what that means is if you say, oh, my wife went out shopping today and she bought a dress at Chanel that cost $95,000.
[02:11:58.790 --> 02:12:08.099]  And she comes home and says, honey, I saved $100,000 because I bought a dress for $95,000 that was $200,000.
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:10.201]  So look at the deal that we got.
[02:12:10.221 --> 02:12:12.924]  You say, but wait a second, we didn't have that.
[02:12:13.064 --> 02:12:14.686]  We didn't have that money to begin with.
[02:12:15.006 --> 02:12:17.507]  I think as men we've all had that discussion at one point in time.
[02:12:17.987 --> 02:12:21.228]  Not necessarily those kind of astronomical numbers.
[02:12:21.888 --> 02:12:24.489]  Let me ask you, because you mentioned the quantitative easing and everything.
[02:12:24.509 --> 02:12:28.130]  We just had the European Central Bank this week come out with quantitative easing.
[02:12:28.990 --> 02:12:35.111]  Just as the American Federal Reserve was saying that they were going to stop doing that, now we've got the European Central Bank saying they're going to do it.
[02:12:35.131 --> 02:12:37.092]  Give us your opinion about what's going on with that.
[02:12:37.711 --> 02:12:41.336]  Well, I mean, let's look at the central banks and the composite of the central banks.
[02:12:41.556 --> 02:12:43.920]  I mean, you've got lunatics running the asylum.
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:44.280]  Yeah.
[02:12:44.380 --> 02:12:47.344]  And the policies that they've implemented have not worked.
[02:12:47.765 --> 02:12:49.467]  Look at the Bank of Japan for 30 years.
[02:12:51.045 --> 02:12:56.548]  That economy has been flatlining, and they've done massive amounts of quantitative easing, enough to blow up.
[02:12:56.568 --> 02:12:58.629]  They're the third largest economy in the world.
[02:12:59.130 --> 02:13:00.650]  Enough to blow up their economy.
[02:13:00.670 --> 02:13:03.892]  You know, you will see the unexpected consequences.
[02:13:03.932 --> 02:13:08.735]  Now, you would think the United States and Janet Yellen, who runs our central bank, would have learned a lesson.
[02:13:08.815 --> 02:13:13.938]  Or Mario Draghi, who's an ex-Goldman Sachs, ex-head of the Bank of Italy,
[02:13:14.558 --> 02:13:19.363]  So he actually created all of Italy's debt and then moved over to run the ECB.
[02:13:19.484 --> 02:13:22.046]  And yesterday he announced more money printing.
[02:13:22.367 --> 02:13:24.048]  I mean, so it's absolute lunacy.
[02:13:24.108 --> 02:13:33.639]  So as a result, when he announced this, the German stock market, the DAX, skyrocketed up 2% and then dropped.
[02:13:34.299 --> 02:13:37.462]  A total of, I think, 7% from peak to trough.
[02:13:37.843 --> 02:13:41.226]  So it totally reversed itself and today it was euphoric again and up 3%.
[02:13:41.947 --> 02:13:44.769]  So what we're seeing is a massive amount of volatility.
[02:13:44.829 --> 02:13:47.512]  This will not end well, I can guarantee you.
[02:13:47.832 --> 02:13:50.755]  And of course what they always like to tell us is that macroeconomics
[02:13:52.797 --> 02:13:53.197]  I don't know.
[02:14:08.083 --> 02:14:12.687]  Whenever we come up with real-world applications, we go, oh, no, no, no, no, that's microeconomics.
[02:14:12.707 --> 02:14:25.538]  You know, microeconomics, you know, everything is fine, but when we get into the world of macroeconomics, it's something like quantum physics and nothing, you know, we got these Heisenberg uncertainty principles and all these other factors in this fantasy land that don't really apply.
[02:14:25.558 --> 02:14:30.743]  I guess when I look at it and we look at the long history of the Federal Reserve,
[02:14:31.403 --> 02:14:48.955]  The fundamental thing that concerns me is just the very idea that we would have central planning to this degree and that a small clique of people who are unaccountable to others can't even audit these people, that they would be able to create boom and bust cycles the way that they do.
[02:14:50.123 --> 02:14:54.767]  Yeah, I think what you're doing, though, is candy-coating it a bit, because basically they're lying to us.
[02:14:54.787 --> 02:14:55.067]  Yeah.
[02:14:55.267 --> 02:15:02.253]  And they're not telling us what's really going on with the economy, but anybody can tell that jobs are not being created.
[02:15:02.333 --> 02:15:10.580]  I mean, President Obama came out with the numbers, the employment figures came out last week and said how great the economy was in the United States.
[02:15:11.020 --> 02:15:19.487]  Now, if the economy is as good as, you know, I'm non-partisan, so basically I don't care who gets in as long as they do the job properly.
[02:15:19.987 --> 02:15:37.939]  So, if the economy is really good, what we have at record highs right now, student loans, $1.3 trillion, the amount of food stamp recipients at all-time record highs, the federal debt at all-time record highs, the amount of money printing, all-time record highs, tuition costs have skyrocketed 1,300% since 1981.
[02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:38.900]  So we do have inflation.
[02:15:43.183 --> 02:15:46.345]  Health care costs, similarly, have gone up massively.
[02:15:46.746 --> 02:15:49.087]  Labor participation, however, has collapsed.
[02:15:49.508 --> 02:15:51.169]  Home ownership has collapsed.
[02:15:51.549 --> 02:15:53.130]  And incomes have collapsed.
[02:15:53.991 --> 02:15:56.373]  Wealth inequality, though, is at a record rate.
[02:15:56.453 --> 02:16:03.658]  And that's what these policies that the Fed, the Bank of England, and the ECB have increased massively.
[02:16:03.738 --> 02:16:04.719]  So unicorns
[02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:09.775]  Rainbows, hope and hype are never trading strategies.
[02:16:10.076 --> 02:16:18.467]  And adding to a losing position, which is what the Fed and the ECB and the Bank of Japan continuously do, is not going to end very well.
[02:16:18.567 --> 02:16:20.389]  I mean, you know, we saw in Weimar Republic,
[02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:23.092]  And we saw in Zimbabwe how that worked out.
[02:16:23.132 --> 02:16:24.213]  Didn't work out very well.
[02:16:24.653 --> 02:16:29.918]  The facts of the matter right now are we've achieved peak debt, right?
[02:16:30.458 --> 02:16:37.384]  So we've got exponential groupthink on behalf of all these central bankers that think that they can plan on everybody's behalf.
[02:16:37.725 --> 02:16:40.827]  You have the same bad pennies that keep reappearing in the scene.
[02:16:41.188 --> 02:16:43.810]  Like you've got Paul Krugman, who hasn't been right
[02:16:44.430 --> 02:16:51.756]  In a long while, you've got Larry Summers who convinced Bill Clinton to end Glass-Steagall, which was the beginning of the end for the credit market.
[02:16:51.796 --> 02:16:57.000]  So all of these things have created what I would say, America to go full banana republic.
[02:16:58.181 --> 02:17:00.402]  Which leads to a massive currency war.
[02:17:01.423 --> 02:17:07.848]  So where do you see this, what happens next as you say in your book, the subtitle here, what happens next and how can we survive?
[02:17:07.888 --> 02:17:10.070]  What do you think is going to be the solution to this?
[02:17:10.819 --> 02:17:18.344]  Well, you know, I think the problem is, is we need to flush out the cesspool of corruption, which we call Washington, D.C.
[02:17:18.724 --> 02:17:22.706]  And until we can do that, we're going to have significant headwinds in every market.
[02:17:23.106 --> 02:17:25.428]  We've lost, the markets don't exist anymore.
[02:17:25.968 --> 02:17:31.170]  What all these manipulations, the central bank has manipulated every asset class that there is.
[02:17:31.470 --> 02:17:36.753]  Stock prices are way too high, bond prices are way too high, and real estate prices are way too high.
[02:17:37.093 --> 02:17:41.835]  The theory behind this was we can increase what's called aggregate demand.
[02:17:42.515 --> 02:17:46.117]  By boosting these asset prices, they can have a trickle-down effect.
[02:17:46.457 --> 02:17:48.658]  This has been a total failure.
[02:17:49.039 --> 02:17:51.980]  There's no evidence that this has worked at all.
[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:53.961]  In fact, the opposite is the case.
[02:17:54.381 --> 02:17:56.062]  So, what do we need to do?
[02:17:56.122 --> 02:17:58.123]  We need to recognize what the problems are.
[02:17:59.444 --> 02:18:00.905]  Don't get me wrong, David.
[02:18:01.646 --> 02:18:07.810]  What I'll tell the listeners is that there's great opportunity in any market where there's volatility.
[02:18:07.830 --> 02:18:15.295]  You just have to pick out your spots and figure out where the opportunities and investment opportunities and horizons will lie for you.
[02:18:15.796 --> 02:18:17.377]  And you have to understand what's going on.
[02:18:18.118 --> 02:18:20.401]  We've seen a swing away from traditional media.
[02:18:20.541 --> 02:18:23.385]  Nobody believes in traditional media anymore for good reason.
[02:18:23.806 --> 02:18:29.975]  Because they know that the politicians have been lying, and they know that the media has been lying to them and complicit.
[02:18:30.015 --> 02:18:32.619]  I mean, look at the whole scandal with Hillary Clinton.
[02:18:33.039 --> 02:18:39.206]  I mean, she's, you know, with the banking system, we've seen too big to fail, too big to jail, too big to bail out.
[02:18:39.286 --> 02:18:42.589]  Now we've got too big to prosecute and too connected to prosecute.
[02:18:42.909 --> 02:18:47.034]  Because I can tell you something right now that your listeners might know or might not know.
[02:18:47.414 --> 02:18:55.923]  This trail of emails, above top secret SAC emails, leads directly to President Obama's desk and Loretta Lynch.
[02:18:56.483 --> 02:19:00.245]  As the Attorney General is covering this up, that's why we haven't heard about it.
[02:19:00.526 --> 02:19:07.050]  What they do tell you, though, is how quickly they want to prosecute Apple for not unlocking an iPhone to end everyone's liberty.
[02:19:07.330 --> 02:19:08.590]  That proceeds right along.
[02:19:08.630 --> 02:19:12.293]  But they sweep this whole thing with Hillary Clinton right underneath the carpet.
[02:19:12.733 --> 02:19:16.996]  Oh, it's stunning, the double standard on everything that we look at.
[02:19:17.036 --> 02:19:25.181]  But clearly, when you just look at, narrow it down to this, as you just pointed out, the difference between being so obsessed about one little iPhone and then
[02:19:26.421 --> 02:19:29.543]  Giving a complete pass to these thousands of emails that were there.
[02:19:29.944 --> 02:19:36.648]  People need to ask themselves, and again, when Napolitano was talking about it, he goes, who hatched this conspiracy?
[02:19:36.708 --> 02:19:41.011]  Because it's, you know, they're plotting together to do something that is fundamentally illegal.
[02:19:41.051 --> 02:19:42.972]  Why would she need to have her own private server?
[02:19:42.993 --> 02:19:50.758]  And I would imagine that it's not just about the classified documents, but it's also about the information that she has on other people as well.
[02:19:51.178 --> 02:19:57.052]  When we come back, I want to get back more into this book, Planet Ponzi with Mitchell Feierstein.
[02:19:57.092 --> 02:19:57.753]  Thank you so much.
[02:19:57.793 --> 02:19:59.918]  We're going to be right back, right after the break.
[02:19:59.958 --> 02:20:00.379]  Stay with us.
[02:20:08.999 --> 02:20:12.504]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:20:13.245 --> 02:20:13.745]  It's true.
[02:20:13.865 --> 02:20:17.811]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:20:18.031 --> 02:20:19.853]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:20:20.414 --> 02:20:24.900]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:20:25.180 --> 02:20:37.802]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[02:20:48.824 --> 02:20:53.105]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[02:20:59.648 --> 02:21:00.928]  For the love of clean water.
[02:21:10.047 --> 02:21:13.469]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:20.954]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:21:21.535 --> 02:21:29.960]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:21:30.161 --> 02:21:34.263]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:21:34.604 --> 02:21:39.767]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vocational
[02:21:39.787 --> 02:21:40.007]  We're good.
[02:22:09.386 --> 02:22:10.686]  Hi, my name is Nick Lupo.
[02:22:10.986 --> 02:22:14.087]  One World Way has been by far the best protein that I've ever had.
[02:22:14.267 --> 02:22:15.548]  I take it three times a day.
[02:22:15.888 --> 02:22:21.209]  Once in the morning as soon as I wake, once for a pre-workout snack, and once for a post-workout recovery drink.
[02:22:21.229 --> 02:22:24.670]  It has helped me transform and sculpt my body into what I have now.
[02:22:24.930 --> 02:22:29.952]  I began taking the product about two years ago, and boy, let me tell you, I'm in the best shape of my life.
[02:22:30.092 --> 02:22:33.633]  I've seen major muscle mass gains and have 0% body fat.
[02:22:33.793 --> 02:22:37.994]  I have had people at my gym ask if I compete in bodybuilding because of how lean and muscular I am.
[02:22:38.254 --> 02:22:44.479]  I used to suffer from everyday aches and pains from hard manual labor my whole life and arthritis that runs through my family.
[02:22:44.699 --> 02:22:48.542]  But One World Way has helped me take that everyday pain from a 10 to a 3.
[02:22:49.002 --> 02:22:51.624]  Some days I feel no pain at all, just full of life and energy.
[02:22:51.845 --> 02:22:54.707]  It has also helped my skin look younger and healthier.
[02:22:54.947 --> 02:22:57.569]  Thank you, Synergistic Nutrition, for One World Way.

[02:24:28.357 --> 02:24:30.619]  He's a highly successful hedge fund manager.
[02:24:31.219 --> 02:24:41.890]  We're talking about what might be done to get out of this massive bubble that the central banks have created, of course, as we were talking in the last segment.
[02:24:42.911 --> 02:24:46.093]  Mitchell, you brought up the too-big-to-fail, too-big-to-jail crowd.
[02:24:46.713 --> 02:24:51.377]  We've seen, everybody knows about El Chapo and his escape from prison.
[02:24:51.937 --> 02:25:00.603]  Most people don't really know about HSBC's escape from prison, because they were laundering money for his drug cartel, the Sinaloa cartel.
[02:25:00.703 --> 02:25:07.812]  They even gave them their own private window to come to to count out the cash, and yet they were just given a mere slap on the wrist.
[02:25:08.192 --> 02:25:14.140]  What do we do about the big banks that control us, but especially about the central bank, the Federal Reserve?
[02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:17.604]  Do you agree that we ought to audit the Fed, perhaps end the Fed?
[02:25:18.445 --> 02:25:19.687]  Yeah, audit the Fed.
[02:25:19.707 --> 02:25:23.190]  I think they should put them in prison, most of the people who are working for the Fed.
[02:25:23.291 --> 02:25:28.436]  I mean, I think you need a high degree of accountability and you need some transparency.
[02:25:28.476 --> 02:25:30.479]  And we have neither with this Federal Reserve.
[02:25:30.819 --> 02:25:32.581]  All we have is lie after lie.
[02:25:32.941 --> 02:25:35.504]  But, you know, not to be too negative about it.
[02:25:35.604 --> 02:25:37.126]  I mean, we need to be realistic.
[02:25:37.186 --> 02:25:38.608]  And what we need to say is look at the
[02:25:38.988 --> 02:25:45.874]  Tons of malinvestment that has been created by the reckless policies that they've implemented over the years.
[02:25:45.894 --> 02:25:49.177]  I mean, you've got Facebook trading at a ridiculous multiple.
[02:25:49.297 --> 02:25:50.438]  Companies like Tesla.
[02:25:50.458 --> 02:25:51.779]  I mean, these are bubbles.
[02:25:52.179 --> 02:25:53.300]  These are huge bubbles.
[02:25:53.340 --> 02:25:55.162]  You talk about the crime in finance.
[02:25:55.202 --> 02:25:58.325]  Now, I took, I've been in investment banking for 35 years.
[02:25:58.445 --> 02:26:05.451]  I took two years off to write my book, Planet Ponzi, because I said to a couple of the governments, unless you let these two big defails fail,
[02:26:06.011 --> 02:26:19.275]  I'm going to write a book about it, and the reason why I'm writing a book is because you all know what happened, and this book explains exactly what happened, so when it fails, catastrophically, you won't be able to say, well, nobody knew that this would happen.
[02:26:19.835 --> 02:26:31.239]  Because now everybody knows, you know, there is a 400-page record of what would happen that, you know, that anyone can understand if you read it, using the Federal Reserve and the other government's own data.
[02:26:31.519 --> 02:26:34.640]  So it's not that it's conspiracy theory, it's actual fact.
[02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:38.182]  Oh yeah, it's actually, it's been done now.
[02:26:38.242 --> 02:26:47.168]  We were warned when they were creating the Fed by Charles Lindbergh's father, who was, I can't remember if he was a senator or congressman, he said, look, they're going to have the power to create boom and bust cycles.
[02:26:47.829 --> 02:26:53.813]  They and their insider friends will be able to profit from this because they will know the timing of these cycles in many cases.
[02:26:54.353 --> 02:27:01.478]  You know, they can adjust this by, you know, lowering interest rates over a prolonged period of time by small amounts and then starting to raise them.
[02:27:01.498 --> 02:27:04.800]  You know, they can create the bubble and then produce the pen that bursts it.
[02:27:05.362 --> 02:27:09.883]  You also, David, what's important to note here is the Fed's supposed to be independent.
[02:27:09.903 --> 02:27:10.883]  They're not independent.
[02:27:11.003 --> 02:27:14.844]  One of the Fed governors is contributing to Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[02:27:15.264 --> 02:27:16.745]  So, I mean, what does that tell you?
[02:27:16.765 --> 02:27:19.385]  Is it pay to play?
[02:27:19.485 --> 02:27:20.786]  How does this work exactly?
[02:27:20.846 --> 02:27:30.768]  That's A. And B. In 1913, the value of the dollar, if you look at the value of the dollar in 1913 when the Fed was set up, it's worth two cents of what it was worth then.
[02:27:30.788 --> 02:27:31.568]  So it's lost 98% of its value.
[02:27:31.588 --> 02:27:31.808]  That's A. B.
[02:27:35.289 --> 02:27:49.258]  If you look at what the Fed has had as a mandate in 1913, that's not applicable today because it doesn't take into effect or consideration what derivative products have done to the markets and the exponential amount of them.
[02:27:49.299 --> 02:27:50.900]  There's over a quadrillion of them.
[02:27:50.920 --> 02:28:00.426]  You know, it's like the narrative that you get from do as I say, not as I do, Warren Buffett, who came out and he said, this generation has it better than everybody else.
[02:28:00.566 --> 02:28:04.569]  And if you look and he used a metric that was like comparing
[02:28:05.309 --> 02:28:06.889]  Apples to unicorns.
[02:28:07.289 --> 02:28:08.350]  I mean, it was ridiculous.
[02:28:08.370 --> 02:28:22.273]  He talked about a GDP figure, but what he didn't talk per capita GDP, but what he didn't say when I was born in 1930, but what he didn't tell you is from 1930 to 1972, we were on a gold standard where you could change dollars for gold.
[02:28:22.733 --> 02:28:26.654]  Right now, you can change dollars for dollars, which is fiat.
[02:28:26.734 --> 02:28:30.194]  And look at how well that worked out in Zimbabwe and Weimar Republic.
[02:28:30.474 --> 02:28:32.735]  It took a wheelbarrow full to buy one egg.
[02:28:33.115 --> 02:28:37.080]  You know, it was $50 trillion to buy an egg in Zimbabwe.
[02:28:37.581 --> 02:28:39.303]  You know, you can't make comparisons.
[02:28:39.724 --> 02:28:44.310]  But most, unfortunately, most of the public is not financially
[02:28:45.786 --> 02:29:10.582]  Literate yeah, and that's that's the thing and it's gonna the thing that's really gonna bring this house of cards down is when the US dollar is no longer the world's reserve currency where we don't have the ability to throw our weight around we've already seen signs of this between the bricks between Russia India China and others talking about how they're going to directly exchange goods and their own currencies without converting to the US dollar and
[02:29:11.082 --> 02:29:15.806]  We've kept this Ponzi scheme going with the alliance we've had with Saudi Arabia, the Petrodollars.
[02:29:16.707 --> 02:29:20.230]  Once this thing starts to unravel, I think it'll go pretty quickly, don't you?
[02:29:20.631 --> 02:29:21.091]  Well, yeah.
[02:29:21.231 --> 02:29:21.492]  U.S.
[02:29:21.512 --> 02:29:25.935]  dollar hegemony has ended already, and people just don't realize that it has died.
[02:29:26.016 --> 02:29:30.960]  That's A. And B. We are in a full-scale, and we have been for two years, currency war.
[02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:33.002]  Because if you look at what's happened in Japan,
[02:29:33.926 --> 02:29:37.509]  And in Europe, their currencies have devalued against the dollar.
[02:29:37.529 --> 02:29:39.490]  They've debased the currency by at least 30%.
[02:29:39.570 --> 02:29:43.773]  So, you know, you've gone from 77 in the yen up to 128 or whatever the peak was, and... Yes.
[02:29:48.957 --> 02:29:53.059]  Absolutely, and the currency is the key at the heart of all of this Ponzi scheme.
[02:29:53.079 --> 02:29:55.620]  Thank you so much for talking to us, Mitchell Feierstein.
[02:29:56.241 --> 02:29:59.462]  The website is planetponzi.com and that's the name of the book as well.
[02:29:59.742 --> 02:30:00.363]  Thank you so much.
[02:30:09.071 --> 02:30:10.512]  Where do you go to leave your legacy?
[02:30:10.672 --> 02:30:13.794]  Well, if you're President Barack Obama, you go to South by Southwest.
[02:30:14.094 --> 02:30:14.595]  That's right.
[02:30:14.735 --> 02:30:23.520]  In addition to the 200,000 workers and guests and attendees who will be filling up the Austin downtown area, Barack Obama is going to show up with his giant Secret Service detail.
[02:30:23.740 --> 02:30:33.547]  Of course, in addition to tying up traffic, as Kit Daniels covered, even the Mayor of Austin is warning people to stay home on Friday as the President's visit is sure to tie up traffic for hours on end.
[02:30:33.807 --> 02:30:37.309]  He will also be utilizing state police and local police resources.
[02:30:37.469 --> 02:30:39.350]  Which could be used during South by Southwest.
[02:30:39.550 --> 02:30:40.830]  He'll be making two stops.
[02:30:41.110 --> 02:30:43.531]  One at the Long Center for Performing Arts to give a speech.
[02:30:43.771 --> 02:30:47.193]  And then jumping across the river to attend a fundraiser at Austin Music Hall.
[02:30:47.393 --> 02:30:52.335]  And then it's on to a private fundraiser at the home of Amy and Kirk Rudy, local developers here.
[02:30:52.555 --> 02:31:02.118]  It was Amy Rudy who approached a local Austin City Council member after he voted against awarding a $37 million tax rebate to her husband's company and said, don't F with my husband.
[02:31:02.259 --> 02:31:03.259]  And she repeated it twice.
[02:31:03.459 --> 02:31:05.461]  These are the kind of people Obama hangs out with.
[02:31:05.501 --> 02:31:08.303]  Rob Due reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:31:08.724 --> 02:31:11.927]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:12.227 --> 02:31:20.254]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:20.474 --> 02:31:25.499]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:32:00.735 --> 02:32:01.635]  We're good to go.
[02:32:15.279 --> 02:32:18.420]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[02:32:18.680 --> 02:32:22.221]  Needed to get my digestive system working correctly again.
[02:32:22.321 --> 02:32:24.742]  So I stumbled on the X2.
[02:32:24.802 --> 02:32:28.202]  We look at a product like Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[02:32:28.422 --> 02:32:31.983]  It's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[02:32:32.303 --> 02:32:34.024]  I needed a detox basically.
[02:32:39.035 --> 02:32:42.498]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[02:32:42.698 --> 02:32:43.739]  What do you have to lose?

[02:32:53.038 --> 02:32:56.880]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[02:32:56.900 --> 02:32:58.401]  I was like really more natural.
[02:32:58.681 --> 02:33:03.703]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:33:22.057 --> 02:33:29.525]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:33:30.546 --> 02:33:34.450]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:34.911 --> 02:33:38.715]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:33:39.095 --> 02:33:40.637]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:41.898 --> 02:33:43.120]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:43.140 --> 02:33:44.081]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[02:33:44.101 --> 02:33:45.842]  We're going to go back to your calls in just a moment.
[02:33:45.863 --> 02:33:47.564]  We're going to go to David in Ohio.
[02:33:47.604 --> 02:33:48.185]  Stay with us, David.
[02:33:48.205 --> 02:33:50.207]  You want to talk about monetary reform.
[02:33:50.227 --> 02:33:55.973]  And of course, we just had Mitchell Feierstein, who was talking about his book, Ponzi Planet.
[02:33:56.694 --> 02:33:57.955]  And actually, Planet Ponzi.
[02:33:58.155 --> 02:33:58.476]  That's it.
[02:33:58.536 --> 02:33:59.156]  Planet Ponzi.
[02:33:59.737 --> 02:34:01.079]  Kind of like Prison Planet.
[02:34:01.179 --> 02:34:02.460]  It got me reversed.
[02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:02.760]  We're good.

[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:12.583]  It's how you can stay connected to InfoWars in the event they launch attacks on our website.
[02:35:12.663 --> 02:35:14.845]  That's happened actually this year.
[02:35:14.885 --> 02:35:15.245]  It happened.
[02:35:15.665 --> 02:35:17.326]  So it's one way that we can communicate with you.
[02:35:17.386 --> 02:35:23.049]  It's one way that you can get information about products, about news, and you can get it first right there.

[02:35:30.233 --> 02:35:32.255]  Let's go to David in Ohio.
[02:35:32.275 --> 02:35:32.815]  Go ahead, David.
[02:35:35.339 --> 02:35:37.601]  Hey David, thanks for letting me get on the air.
[02:35:39.062 --> 02:35:48.688]  I wanted to disagree with the guest, and of course most of the comments you guys have made on the show.
[02:35:48.768 --> 02:36:04.018]  If you have control of the money supply, you have control of the judicial, you have the control of the legislative, you have control of the executive, why would these people let a system that they have full complete power over fail?
[02:36:05.416 --> 02:36:06.277]  They would do something.
[02:36:06.297 --> 02:36:07.378]  There would be some band-aid.
[02:36:07.398 --> 02:36:08.358]  There would be something.
[02:36:08.398 --> 02:36:09.760]  There would be quantitative easing.
[02:36:09.780 --> 02:36:10.900]  There would be a jubilee.
[02:36:10.940 --> 02:36:12.141]  There would be debt forgiveness.
[02:36:12.161 --> 02:36:13.102]  There would be something.
[02:36:13.663 --> 02:36:17.366]  If you had full power, why would you let the current system fail?
[02:36:17.426 --> 02:36:18.386]  It makes no sense.
[02:36:18.987 --> 02:36:20.828]  And I think that's why it hasn't failed.
[02:36:21.509 --> 02:36:25.192]  All these doom and gloomers,
[02:36:26.152 --> 02:36:32.275]  Well, I don't know.
[02:36:32.515 --> 02:36:35.437]  I think a lot of us looked at 2008 and thought that was a failure.
[02:36:35.457 --> 02:36:42.600]  I think a lot of us look at, as he pointed out, 99% of the purchasing power of our currency being lost over 100 years.
[02:36:42.620 --> 02:36:44.521]  I think that would qualify as a failure.
[02:36:45.022 --> 02:36:48.383]  And the concern is the same concern that we had at the very beginning.
[02:36:48.844 --> 02:36:53.306]  If you give this kind of power to a private organization,
[02:36:54.026 --> 02:36:56.628]  That is not really accountable to the public in no way.
[02:36:56.668 --> 02:37:01.371]  As a matter of fact, we are not even allowed, the Congress is not even allowed to know what happens inside of there.
[02:37:01.951 --> 02:37:04.853]  And that's the important thing, I think, about Audit the Fed.
[02:37:05.813 --> 02:37:07.134]  It shows the arrogance.
[02:37:07.575 --> 02:37:08.815]  It shows the secrecy.
[02:37:09.216 --> 02:37:12.678]  It shows the closed clubness of this whole issue.
[02:37:13.018 --> 02:37:16.840]  The fact that we're not even, our elected representatives are not even allowed to see what's going on.
[02:37:16.900 --> 02:37:18.201]  It's like these trade deals.
[02:37:18.561 --> 02:37:20.663]  There is a globalist cabal.
[02:37:21.423 --> 02:37:21.803]  That is
[02:37:42.142 --> 02:37:51.284]  They got the power to create the boom and bust cycles, to set up the timing of these boom and bust cycles, and we've had a lot of cycles.
[02:37:51.344 --> 02:38:05.786]  If you've got the levers of the economy, if you can make the economy grow or you can cause it to contract by adjusting the money supply, by adjusting the interest rates, if you've got all those types of controls, nobody is allowed to see what you're doing, nobody is allowed to remove you if they don't like what you're doing.
[02:38:06.126 --> 02:38:09.947]  I reject the whole idea in the first place of central planning of an economy.
[02:38:10.487 --> 02:38:25.093]  But it's even worse when you compound the error of central planning as if somebody is doing this, you know, they're trying, we could have central plan society, economy, where somebody is really trying to do their darndest to make this all work.
[02:38:25.808 --> 02:38:28.970]  And they just don't know how to make this work, because that's what always happens.
[02:38:28.990 --> 02:38:30.071]  That's what happened with Russia.
[02:38:31.051 --> 02:38:36.155]  You can't centrally plan an economy even if you're honest and intelligent.
[02:38:36.695 --> 02:38:46.562]  But when you give these levers to people and you hide it in secrecy, you make it private, you say we're not even allowed to look at it, that's what the Audit the Fed movement is about.
[02:38:46.602 --> 02:38:50.104]  It's to expose that secrecy, that closed society.
[02:38:50.784 --> 02:38:55.168]  And once that's exposed, then we can move to the next step, which is to end that society.
[02:38:55.208 --> 02:38:56.129]  That's the ultimate goal.
[02:38:56.529 --> 02:38:58.411]  So yeah, we have a disagreement, David.
[02:38:58.511 --> 02:39:03.515]  I think that there has been a lot that has worked out.
[02:39:03.575 --> 02:39:05.196]  I don't think it's worked out very well for us.
[02:39:05.256 --> 02:39:06.737]  I know it's worked out very well for them.
[02:39:07.198 --> 02:39:13.763]  And I think it's shameful that we have created this massive derivatives market.
[02:39:14.023 --> 02:39:15.685]  They continue to pump up the currency.
[02:39:15.725 --> 02:39:17.847]  They've been able to get away with it only because
[02:39:18.487 --> 02:39:22.310]  They had the United States set up as the world's reserve currency.
[02:39:22.410 --> 02:39:24.451]  That is the bubble is going to burst.
[02:39:25.231 --> 02:39:26.612]  Let's go to the next call.
[02:39:26.632 --> 02:39:29.614]  Let's go to Bill in Wisconsin.
[02:39:29.634 --> 02:39:29.854]  Bill.
[02:39:31.596 --> 02:39:43.003]  Yeah, David, a couple of points that I'd like to bring up for you to relay to Alex or to Stone on the Trump campaign.
[02:39:43.965 --> 02:39:53.169]  The first thing is, Trump could get a lot of these Bernie Sanders people by endorsing Glass-Steagall.
[02:39:55.509 --> 02:39:59.171]  They're upset, obviously, with the bank.
[02:39:59.956 --> 02:40:04.157]  And the situation that's going on there.
[02:40:04.277 --> 02:40:05.577]  So that would be one.
[02:40:06.397 --> 02:40:07.178]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:40:07.418 --> 02:40:07.698]  Go ahead.
[02:40:07.758 --> 02:40:08.498]  Go ahead.
[02:40:08.738 --> 02:40:09.178]  Glass-Steagall.
[02:40:09.198 --> 02:40:10.398]  That he should do.
[02:40:11.439 --> 02:40:23.841]  Trump, in talking to the voters in different states, shows great empathy for the fact that heroin abuse is running rampant in our country.
[02:40:24.401 --> 02:40:27.002]  And he says we're going to stop it at the borders.
[02:40:27.765 --> 02:40:30.791]  Why not stop it in Afghanistan?
[02:40:31.752 --> 02:40:38.625]  All of the heroin is coming out of the opium production from that part of the world.
[02:40:39.266 --> 02:40:40.969]  So whatever it takes.
[02:40:41.796 --> 02:40:52.985]  Stop the CIA from protecting it, sending packages of $100 bills to the corrupt government of Afghanistan.
[02:40:53.506 --> 02:40:53.706]  I agree.
[02:40:53.726 --> 02:40:54.447]  Keep it going.
[02:40:54.627 --> 02:40:55.387]  Oh yeah, we've seen that.
[02:40:55.407 --> 02:41:02.894]  We know that the Taliban had virtually crushed that trafficking in opiates.
[02:41:03.514 --> 02:41:04.595]  And then when the U.S.
[02:41:04.635 --> 02:41:10.581]  government took over, we saw it soar into record profits every year, and now it's virtually all the supply worldwide.
[02:41:10.601 --> 02:41:12.082]  It's in the high 90 percentile.
[02:41:12.983 --> 02:41:13.483]  I agree with you.
[02:41:13.704 --> 02:41:17.607]  Now, of course, you know, Trump has come out for the people that would support Bernie Sanders.
[02:41:17.687 --> 02:41:19.849]  Again, he's against the trade deals.
[02:41:19.869 --> 02:41:20.910]  He's against NAFTA.
[02:41:20.930 --> 02:41:27.697]  When you're talking about the war on drugs, at one point in time, and of course Donald Trump hasn't talked about this, maybe he will once the
[02:41:28.657 --> 02:41:40.165]  Republican primaries are over because, you know, that is something the Republicans, and for the life of me I can't understand why the Republicans, Republican voters, I understand why the Republican establishment supports the war on drugs.
[02:41:40.485 --> 02:41:43.507]  It's a very effective lever, a tool of power.
[02:41:44.228 --> 02:41:45.348]  It was designed that way.
[02:41:45.949 --> 02:41:49.031]  But the Republican voters need to understand that it was a UN agenda.
[02:41:49.711 --> 02:41:56.373]  The UN created this agenda with all the schedules, put all the drugs in the four schedules, did it ten years before Nixon declared the war on drugs.
[02:41:57.013 --> 02:42:03.314]  Nevertheless, it's kind of a third rail, I guess, if you want to talk about the failed war on drugs and prohibition.
[02:42:03.934 --> 02:42:05.055]  Rand Paul talked about it.
[02:42:05.415 --> 02:42:09.776]  It may be one of the reasons why he was harmed and didn't do well in the primaries.
[02:42:10.376 --> 02:42:20.221]  But I remember seeing interviews with Donald Trump where he said, the only way we're going to stop the war on drugs, the violence that's coming out of this, is to decriminalize this.
[02:42:20.281 --> 02:42:24.484]  And so I think he might be, I think he's smart enough to see through this.
[02:42:24.524 --> 02:42:31.788]  I think most people who look at this carefully understand that this has done exactly the opposite of what we wanted it to do.
[02:42:32.348 --> 02:42:43.916]  You know, we were talking about the Federal Reserve and one of the things, we've got a special report here from John Bowne about secret societies because, you know, it's one of the best examples of a secret society.
[02:42:43.956 --> 02:42:46.717]  It can't even be audited by our congressman.
[02:42:47.198 --> 02:42:52.441]  I would say that's a pretty secret private society that is controlling our economy, the Federal Reserve.
[02:42:52.481 --> 02:42:57.904]  But John Bowne has a broader report on secret societies are no longer a secret.
[02:42:57.944 --> 02:42:58.645]  Here's that report.
[02:42:59.639 --> 02:43:01.780]  What is hidden shall be revealed.
[02:43:02.101 --> 02:43:12.787]  Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House, recently had this to say, eliminating any doubt that we are aggressively ruled by nothing less than a global Luciferian elite.
[02:43:12.887 --> 02:43:19.171]  And now they're faced with a very real prospect of Donald Trump becoming the leader of the party, and it absolutely drives them crazy.
[02:43:19.671 --> 02:43:19.831]  Why?
[02:43:19.851 --> 02:43:22.572]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.
[02:43:22.632 --> 02:43:28.034]  And we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.
[02:43:28.054 --> 02:43:28.494]  We decided long ago
[02:43:49.924 --> 02:43:59.232]  That the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it.
[02:44:00.353 --> 02:44:08.500]  Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions.
[02:44:09.621 --> 02:44:17.348]  Even today, there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it.
[02:44:18.504 --> 02:44:32.495]  And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment.
[02:44:33.496 --> 02:44:44.825]  For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covet means for expanding its sphere of influence.
[02:44:45.936 --> 02:44:50.741]  What is at stake is more than one small country.
[02:44:51.943 --> 02:44:53.304]  It is a big idea.
[02:44:54.460 --> 02:44:55.541]  A New World Order.
[02:44:56.121 --> 02:44:59.264]  The New World Order is no longer hiding in the shadows.
[02:44:59.704 --> 02:45:06.770]  They are utilizing their total domination of civilization to bring your morality into a new dark age.
[02:45:07.090 --> 02:45:22.342]  Whether it's the United Nations David Rockefeller Lucius Trust rollout of demoralization, courtesy of Alice Bailey's 10-point plan, the purpose of which is to change Christian tradition or to redeem the nations of Christian tradition.
[02:45:22.702 --> 02:45:26.125]  Number one, take God and prayer out of the education system.
[02:45:26.425 --> 02:45:29.488]  Number two, reduce parental authority over the children.
[02:45:29.808 --> 02:45:33.391]  Number three, destroy the Judeo-Christian family structure.
[02:45:33.771 --> 02:45:41.338]  Number four, cause society to reevaluate sexual freedom and reduce the population by making abortion legal.
[02:45:41.698 --> 02:45:42.439]  Number five,
[02:45:42.839 --> 02:45:44.762]  Make divorce easy and legal.
[02:45:45.002 --> 02:45:47.887]  Free people from the concept of marriage for life.
[02:45:49.108 --> 02:45:53.535]  Promote homosexuality as an alternative lifestyle.
[02:45:54.036 --> 02:45:57.881]  Corrupt and defile the imagination by debasing art.
[02:45:58.662 --> 02:46:02.606]  Number eight, use media to brainwash the population.
[02:46:03.066 --> 02:46:08.691]  Number nine, promote a new age movement to overshadow the Christian faith.
[02:46:09.151 --> 02:46:17.218]  Number ten, have governments make all of the previous points laws and have the church endorse these changes.
[02:46:17.678 --> 02:46:19.720]  These points were stated over 70 years ago.
[02:46:21.081 --> 02:46:24.726]  And have metamorphosized into the civilization we know now in 2016.
[02:46:25.347 --> 02:46:27.650]  And it's all around you.
[02:46:27.950 --> 02:46:38.023]  For instance, the ongoing force-feeding of Illuminati symbolism through entertainment, as Hollywood's romance with occultism has finally percolated to the surface.
[02:46:38.343 --> 02:46:48.546]  Offering performances by Illuminati slaves akin to Keisha, for example, adorned with satanic regalia, channeling Lucifer on the Today Show, no less.
[02:46:48.926 --> 02:46:53.368]  As in the words of one of the New World Order's chief engineers, former U.S.
[02:46:53.448 --> 02:47:00.670]  National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, history is much more the product of chaos than conspiracy.
[02:47:01.030 --> 02:47:03.031]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[02:47:05.529 --> 02:47:07.029]  And again, that was a report from John Bowne.
[02:47:07.069 --> 02:47:08.770]  Secret societies are no longer a secret.
[02:47:08.790 --> 02:47:11.191]  You can see that on the Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[02:47:11.671 --> 02:47:14.411]  And we have Alex Jones joining us now, reporting from the road.
[02:47:14.491 --> 02:47:14.731]  Alex?
[02:47:16.112 --> 02:47:16.632]  That's right.
[02:47:16.712 --> 02:47:18.292]  And again, folks, I told you I'd be back today.
[02:47:18.312 --> 02:47:21.253]  I appreciate David doing it, but I had to basically take off my spring break.
[02:47:21.733 --> 02:47:27.955]  My spring break, my vacations are generally actually taking off from the radio show to finish operations.
[02:47:27.975 --> 02:47:29.535]  We're running plans, we're rolling out things.
[02:47:29.876 --> 02:47:31.396]  Take care of your family.
[02:47:34.991 --> 02:47:36.432]  I think we just lost Alex.
[02:47:37.632 --> 02:47:39.132]  Okay, here he is.
[02:47:40.353 --> 02:47:41.953]  Okay, how much of that did you hear, David?
[02:47:41.973 --> 02:47:44.554]  Go ahead and repeat.
[02:47:44.614 --> 02:47:47.375]  I guess we lost about the last five, ten seconds, Alex.
[02:47:48.596 --> 02:47:49.896]  Is it my cell phone?
[02:47:50.656 --> 02:47:52.117]  Yeah, it cut off for a moment there, yeah.
[02:47:52.837 --> 02:47:54.318]  You were telling us you were on the road.
[02:47:54.338 --> 02:47:54.898]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:47:54.958 --> 02:47:57.699]  Alright, I'm going to start back over again.
[02:47:57.719 --> 02:47:58.559]  Do you guys hear me now?
[02:47:58.819 --> 02:47:59.800]  Yes, got you right now.
[02:48:00.060 --> 02:48:01.140]  Alright, I'm going to try again.
[02:48:01.160 --> 02:48:02.961]  I don't think it's my phone.
[02:48:04.167 --> 02:48:10.389]  What I'm getting at here is I have been taking care of a lot of other business for the operation.
[02:48:10.409 --> 02:48:12.550]  Everybody knows I do these staycations.
[02:48:12.750 --> 02:48:15.470]  I meant to be back today, but I appreciate David being there.
[02:48:16.151 --> 02:48:23.893]  And I will be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., and then all next week live on the air with all the huge things that are developing and unfolding as well.
[02:48:24.373 --> 02:48:30.975]  And we'll cover the next most key group of primaries that are the Ides of March, obviously.
[02:48:32.174 --> 02:48:39.940]  On March 15th, but there is a lot of stuff happening, a lot of things unfolding, obviously in the world.
[02:48:40.641 --> 02:48:48.447]  Just what John Baum was talking about just when you were covering, David, and that is that world government is openly out in the open.
[02:48:49.067 --> 02:48:58.014]  And so we have a debate about the world government, we point it out to the public, we tell people what its aims are, and show their own quotes and explain that that's why all this bad stuff is happening.
[02:48:58.556 --> 02:49:06.120]  That they set up businesses and systems to manage and exacerbate human crises in their own words.
[02:49:06.300 --> 02:49:22.468]  That full spectrum dominance can be exposed and we can really free humanity to not go into some utopia, but to actually have a shot at working on our problems and not have these saboteurs who basically handicap everyone
[02:49:23.408 --> 02:49:28.251]  So that these globalist mental midgets and demons can rule over the rest of us.
[02:49:28.271 --> 02:49:40.779]  They are so wicked, so selfish, so hateful that they have to lower us down to an extremely dumbed-down level so that they can rule over us.
[02:49:40.799 --> 02:49:46.743]  And I know I keep repeating that, but we can talk about this and that and this piece and all the different wheels of this thing.
[02:49:47.768 --> 02:50:00.158]  All the gears, but if you pull back and look at the big enchilada, if you look at the larger power structure that's there and understand what the machine is, it is an artificiality.
[02:50:00.258 --> 02:50:02.780]  It is an attempt to take over creation.
[02:50:02.920 --> 02:50:09.645]  It is an attempt to take over the natural order and create a very twisted, ugly, demonic system in its place.
[02:50:10.045 --> 02:50:11.046]  And that doesn't come from some
[02:50:13.802 --> 02:50:15.624]  I'm not denying Christ or that I'm a Christian.
[02:50:15.864 --> 02:50:20.189]  I'm saying to atheists and other people, do you understand the globalists want to play God?
[02:50:20.429 --> 02:50:22.651]  Like Ray Kurzweil said, I don't believe in God yet.
[02:50:22.991 --> 02:50:25.133]  I'm going to become God, virgin with machines.
[02:50:25.294 --> 02:50:26.475]  That is the ruling.
[02:50:27.688 --> 02:50:36.210]  Cosmology, belief, goal, promised land that the New World Order controllers are pushing for.
[02:50:36.730 --> 02:50:44.532]  And that's what all of us at InfoWars, our great crew of wonderful folks like David Knight and the people behind the scenes, are trying to warn humanity about.
[02:50:44.552 --> 02:50:47.813]  And the good news is, we have a massive audience of tens of millions.
[02:50:48.213 --> 02:50:53.695]  Tens of millions that are hardcore listeners, billions in the aggregate that have seen our material and our information.
[02:50:54.435 --> 02:51:00.999]  And if those people become empowered and realize how powerful they are, the Pentagon's own documents say they're not worried about terrorists or criminals.
[02:51:01.039 --> 02:51:07.062]  They're worried about empowered individuals changing paradigms and creating their own systems.
[02:51:07.583 --> 02:51:08.163]  We'll be back.
[02:51:08.323 --> 02:51:09.023]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:09.083 --> 02:51:09.464]  David Nyko.
[02:51:09.484 --> 02:51:10.985]  This is not an offering to sell a franchise.
[02:51:11.065 --> 02:51:13.406]  Franchise offerings are made through the Franchise Disclosure Document.
[02:51:13.829 --> 02:51:17.113]  Are you one of the 70% of Americans who hate their jobs?
[02:51:17.413 --> 02:51:19.755]  Do you wish you could work for yourself but don't know what to do?

[02:52:09.115 --> 02:52:12.816]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:52:13.076 --> 02:52:19.217]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:52:19.377 --> 02:52:26.378]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.

[02:52:41.944 --> 02:52:46.727]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:52:46.787 --> 02:52:50.129]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:52:50.369 --> 02:52:51.990]  No needles, no injections.

[02:54:17.682 --> 02:54:18.943]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:19.023 --> 02:54:24.087]  I'm David Knight in the studio, and joining us, reporting from the road, is Alex Jones.
[02:54:24.207 --> 02:54:24.448]  Alex?
[02:54:25.568 --> 02:54:27.910]  David, again, thank you so much for hosting today.
[02:54:27.930 --> 02:54:29.312]  Folks, just tuned in.
[02:54:29.712 --> 02:54:35.016]  I have been out much of the week on staycation, getting a whole bunch of family issues and also business issues.
[02:54:36.017 --> 02:54:37.818]  Launch Info War is the next level completed.
[02:54:38.259 --> 02:54:44.364]  We have successfully completed a whole bunch of really big milestones and hurdles this week, so I want to thank God for that right now.
[02:54:44.844 --> 02:54:51.827]  And I want to be thankful and thank God for our great crew and I want to thank God for the listeners and our affiliates and everybody out there.
[02:54:51.847 --> 02:54:52.907]  And I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
[02:54:53.288 --> 02:55:04.952]  I get so angry a lot of times because I'm not doing enough or I'm not being effective enough and I kind of burn out like a race car over revving 12,000 RBMs.
[02:55:05.052 --> 02:55:06.413]  So that's what it comes down to.
[02:55:07.771 --> 02:55:15.777]  But when you really sit back and look at how awake the planet's becoming, how much good is happening, you have to realize there's not just evil in the world, there's not just darkness, there's also light.
[02:55:16.338 --> 02:55:19.360]  And for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction.
[02:55:19.420 --> 02:55:24.964]  I say that not because I don't have a million articles to talk about and a thousand issues to cover, it's because those are so core.
[02:55:25.365 --> 02:55:30.028]  We have parasites that would dumb us down and take control of civilization to play God.
[02:55:30.509 --> 02:55:34.632]  And that's never become more clear with the Republicans saying they're going to steal the election openly.
[02:55:34.992 --> 02:55:37.354]  And they've gone from denying election fraud to just admitting it.
[02:55:38.214 --> 02:55:48.139]  It's just everything is coming out in the open and humanity is historically always given a chance when evil gets really bad to wake up and say no before it's too late.
[02:55:48.219 --> 02:55:51.981]  And America and the world is being given massive chances to turn back.
[02:55:52.061 --> 02:55:54.863]  Let's say we don't believe in God, just to the agnostics out there.
[02:55:55.103 --> 02:55:55.443]  Whatever.
[02:55:55.543 --> 02:55:56.523]  Judgment of tyranny.
[02:55:56.924 --> 02:55:58.144]  Judgment of our actions.
[02:55:58.604 --> 02:56:00.746]  We're being given a long time to turn back.
[02:56:01.166 --> 02:56:05.448]  We're being given a long time and thousands of red flags upon thousands to turn
[02:56:06.351 --> 02:56:09.357]  Turn back and stop going down this road.
[02:56:09.918 --> 02:56:10.860]  And it is pure evil.
[02:56:10.961 --> 02:56:15.169]  The chimeras, the baby parts, the genetic engineering, all of it, it's here.
[02:56:15.710 --> 02:56:17.434]  And we have to realize this is happening.
[02:56:18.089 --> 02:56:21.351]  Not to be victims, but to be overcomers and defeat the globalists.
[02:56:21.391 --> 02:56:33.777]  So I just want to thank all of you, and I want to thank God for His Son, Jesus Christ, and His sacrifices, and everybody else who's tried to be Christ-like in His image, and tried to be good, and tried to do the right thing, because I know it's hard.
[02:56:34.098 --> 02:56:42.042]  Let me tell you, God always ends up carrying us through, and in the few occasions where we're not carried through, it's for an example to others, and it's the larger plan.
[02:56:42.122 --> 02:56:46.985]  And that's all I'm saying, is I don't sit here and demand things from God, but I do love God.
[02:56:48.357 --> 02:56:51.980]  I want to be a good person, and I want to defend humanity, and I want to build people up.
[02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:57.265]  I don't want to see this elite win, and I know you don't as well, so thank you all for your support of InfoWars.
[02:56:57.705 --> 02:57:02.169]  And we're in this together, and we're not perfect, but we're slinging for the fences and giving everything we got.
[02:57:02.269 --> 02:57:05.232]  I know David Knight is as well, so thank you all for your support.
[02:57:05.712 --> 02:57:12.138]  I was going to do a whole rant today about Obama coming to town and how South by Southwest is a giant scam.
[02:57:13.476 --> 02:57:23.504]  In my view, stealing people's dreams and as a giant corporate system, just to foist and have people pay thousands of dollars to be foisted into corporate propaganda.
[02:57:23.945 --> 02:57:25.026]  And isn't it perfect?
[02:57:25.046 --> 02:57:28.649]  This empty suit, this lying, narcissistic, globalist devil.
[02:57:29.229 --> 02:57:34.013]  Barack Obama, who defends Muslims, jumping, boiling oil on women's faces.
[02:57:34.033 --> 02:57:34.334]  He does.
[02:57:34.354 --> 02:57:37.476]  That's who he supports, that's who he funds, that's who he has the left on attack.
[02:57:37.716 --> 02:57:40.779]  But he hates fathers, he hates Christians, he hates strong women.
[02:57:41.791 --> 02:57:50.035]  This evil is allied with radical Islam, which is becoming all of Islam, because they hate humanity and they hate freedom and they hate free will.
[02:57:50.095 --> 02:57:52.116]  They want to shackle us and enslave us.
[02:57:52.176 --> 02:58:02.982]  But I'm telling you, the Renaissance and the West and the Christian revolution, the real Christian revolution, not the fraudulent church, but the real revolution of Jesus Christ will not be stopped.
[02:58:03.282 --> 02:58:05.343]  And the New World Order is going down.
[02:58:05.543 --> 02:58:08.204]  We're going to go through great trials and tribulations before it happens.
[02:58:08.565 --> 02:58:09.245]  But believe me,
[02:58:09.815 --> 02:58:11.697]  Believe me, you don't need to fear this new world order.
[02:58:11.737 --> 02:58:15.501]  You need to fear God Almighty, ladies and gentlemen, and that's what it comes down to.
[02:58:15.962 --> 02:58:17.503]  So, David, I salute you and I thank you.
[02:58:17.523 --> 02:58:19.165]  Please support us, listeners.
[02:58:19.525 --> 02:58:26.753]  Super Mill Vitality, InfraPlex, BrainForce, the name I had out is the best out there, X2, all the products.

[02:58:30.917 --> 02:58:33.760]  If some of you are sick of hearing me be religious, that's how I operate.
[02:58:33.780 --> 02:58:34.901]  I know it's a spiritual war.
[02:58:35.201 --> 02:58:35.842]  And I'm sorry.
[02:58:36.342 --> 02:58:37.764]  I'm not from Pharisee on a high horse.
[02:58:38.044 --> 02:58:41.027]  I just know it's all about good and evil, folks, more than ever.
[02:58:41.227 --> 02:58:42.108]  David Knight, you take over.
[02:58:42.148 --> 02:58:42.568]  God bless you.
[02:58:43.229 --> 02:58:43.849]  Thank you, Alex.

[02:58:50.415 --> 02:58:51.336]  Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:58.717 --> 02:59:03.078]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male, and then when Super Female came out, tell us what happened.
[02:59:03.358 --> 02:59:07.979]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:59:08.119 --> 02:59:09.159]  Talk about the effects.
[02:59:09.459 --> 02:59:10.940]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:59:10.960 --> 02:59:12.580]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:59:12.900 --> 02:59:13.960]  I feel like I look better.
[02:59:14.020 --> 02:59:14.660]  I feel better.
[02:59:14.720 --> 02:59:15.801]  I feel sexier.
[02:59:16.121 --> 02:59:16.481]  I love it.
[02:59:16.741 --> 02:59:19.661]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[02:59:19.721 --> 02:59:22.422]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[02:59:22.662 --> 02:59:23.683]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:59:23.723 --> 02:59:24.764]  Consult your physician.
[02:59:24.924 --> 02:59:27.125]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today.
[02:59:27.285 --> 02:59:28.226]  This is life-changing.
[02:59:28.646 --> 02:59:29.427]  Shower filters.
[02:59:29.567 --> 02:59:31.188]  We're introducing the best yet.
[02:59:31.288 --> 02:59:35.211]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[02:59:35.351 --> 02:59:39.975]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[02:59:40.175 --> 02:59:47.100]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[02:59:47.260 --> 02:59:50.162]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free shipping
[02:59:50.723 --> 02:59:51.965]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:14.804 --> 03:00:25.527]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[03:00:25.667 --> 03:00:31.008]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[03:00:31.568 --> 03:00:36.790]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[03:00:37.630 --> 03:00:38.930]  It is a big idea.
[03:00:38.990 --> 03:00:40.471]  A new world order.
[03:00:44.687 --> 03:00:47.472]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[03:00:47.853 --> 03:00:49.095]  It just pancaked.
[03:00:49.255 --> 03:00:55.587]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[03:01:08.797 --> 03:01:14.412]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[03:01:18.717 --> 03:01:19.537]  Guns will be taken.
[03:01:19.598 --> 03:01:20.578]  No one will be able to be armed.
[03:01:20.798 --> 03:01:22.519]  We're going to take all guns.
[03:01:22.559 --> 03:01:27.342]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[03:01:27.402 --> 03:01:28.863]  Global governance at last.
[03:01:28.963 --> 03:01:29.883]  Is it one world?
[03:01:29.923 --> 03:01:31.344]  The central bank is in charge.
[03:01:31.404 --> 03:01:35.086]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[03:01:35.186 --> 03:01:39.209]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[03:01:41.490 --> 03:01:46.193]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:01:48.467 --> 03:01:54.012]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com with an update on something that has happened in the last 24 hours.
[03:01:54.452 --> 03:02:00.658]  Something that is probably the most horrendous act ever carried out on American soil.
[03:02:01.038 --> 03:02:02.019]  No, not Pearl Harbor.
[03:02:02.499 --> 03:02:03.120]  Not even 9-11.
[03:02:04.041 --> 03:02:06.263]  Something far worse than that.
[03:02:06.903 --> 03:02:09.085]  This is the punch heard around the world.
[03:02:09.626 --> 03:02:12.348]  And now we're going to bring in Darren McBreen to talk about this.
[03:02:12.668 --> 03:02:14.129]  Now Darren, hey.
[03:02:15.063 --> 03:02:16.204]  We're not at a Trump rally, man.
[03:02:16.244 --> 03:02:16.524]  Come on.
[03:02:16.884 --> 03:02:18.305]  So, what's going on right now?
[03:02:18.325 --> 03:02:26.209]  We're flipping through all the news channels a second ago, and all I'm seeing is this incidence that kind of unfolded where someone got punched in a Trump rally.
[03:02:26.989 --> 03:02:28.090]  It's on every single channel.
[03:02:28.190 --> 03:02:29.251]  I mean, you can't get away from it.
[03:02:29.491 --> 03:02:42.338]  By the time you see this video, you've probably already seen the video of Rakim Jones, who was a protester at a Donald Trump rally, and he said he was there as a social experiment
[03:02:42.918 --> 03:02:45.739]  Well, him and his friends went to the Trump rally.
[03:02:45.759 --> 03:02:49.140]  They started yelling at Donald Trump as soon as Donald Trump got on the stage.
[03:02:49.540 --> 03:02:56.302]  They were quickly met by security and police officers who then escorted them, began to escort them out of the building.
[03:02:56.822 --> 03:03:01.083]  And then a 78-year-old man named John McGraw
[03:03:01.703 --> 03:03:05.324]  So basically what you're saying is you have a group of people who went looking for trouble
[03:03:21.408 --> 03:03:22.429]  They found trouble.
[03:03:22.830 --> 03:03:24.912]  It was a social experiment.
[03:03:25.573 --> 03:03:25.974]  Oh, okay.
[03:03:26.274 --> 03:03:28.076]  So they found that experiment.
[03:03:28.096 --> 03:03:29.238]  They got their cause and effect.
[03:03:29.638 --> 03:03:32.161]  And now they're complaining about it on national TV.
[03:03:32.181 --> 03:03:34.264]  They're being held up as these heroes.
[03:03:34.304 --> 03:03:35.485]  National heroes now.
[03:03:35.666 --> 03:03:37.528]  Hillary Clinton's already been asked about.
[03:03:37.708 --> 03:03:44.755]  Count me among those who are truly distraught and even appalled by a lot of what I see.
[03:03:45.135 --> 03:03:47.558]  Mr. Trump should not be urging people on.
[03:03:47.618 --> 03:03:58.148]  This is deeply distressing and I think as the campaign goes further, more and more Americans are going to be really disturbed by the kind of campaign he's
[03:03:58.148 --> 03:03:58.588]  It's running.
[03:03:58.768 --> 03:04:03.832]  All you're going to see for the entire weekend, you're going to see this again and again and again.
[03:04:04.212 --> 03:04:08.395]  And this guy, Rakim Jones, is going to be a national hero.
[03:04:08.755 --> 03:04:09.755]  I'm going to predict it right now.
[03:04:10.156 --> 03:04:14.518]  Barack Obama is going to invite Rakim Jones to the White House.
[03:04:14.679 --> 03:04:15.019]  You watch.
[03:04:15.399 --> 03:04:17.581]  This is something that they're trying to use.
[03:04:17.601 --> 03:04:20.503]  They're doing everything they can to go and derail Trump.
[03:04:20.663 --> 03:04:22.545]  They know that people are showing up to his rallies.
[03:04:22.625 --> 03:04:23.385]  They're emotional.
[03:04:23.445 --> 03:04:24.646]  And I want to say one more thing.
[03:04:24.986 --> 03:04:30.831]  By the way, at this rally and the average Trump rally, there are people of all color.
[03:04:30.871 --> 03:04:32.512]  There's lots of black folks there.
[03:04:33.133 --> 03:04:35.895]  Every race and color you can imagine is at these Trump rallies.
[03:04:36.075 --> 03:04:37.836]  You know, it's something you never want to see happen.
[03:04:38.136 --> 03:04:40.918]  But again, it's not connected to the campaign whatsoever.
[03:04:41.319 --> 03:04:43.801]  It's something that happened in the crowd by bystanders.
[03:04:45.002 --> 03:04:55.929]  I guess, Jeff, what some would say here, and let me ask you, some would say it is connected to the campaign, or maybe it's connected to the campaign in terms of the tone and the atmosphere that the candidate himself is creating.
[03:04:56.110 --> 03:04:59.392]  The MSNBC is going to continue to play this over and over again.
[03:04:59.412 --> 03:05:03.415]  You're going to know that name, Rakeem Jones, by heart at the end of the day.
[03:05:03.755 --> 03:05:06.857]  Stay tuned for more reports about the punch heard around the world.
[03:05:07.198 --> 03:05:08.979]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[03:05:09.019 --> 03:05:10.380]  Where do you go to leave your legacy?
[03:05:10.560 --> 03:05:13.681]  Well, if you're President Barack Obama, you go to South by Southwest.
[03:05:13.981 --> 03:05:14.481]  That's right.
[03:05:14.621 --> 03:05:23.404]  In addition to the 200,000 workers and guests and attendees who will be filling up the Austin downtown area, Barack Obama is going to show up with his giant Secret Service detail.
[03:05:23.624 --> 03:05:33.448]  Of course, in addition to tying up traffic, as Kit Daniels covered, even the Mayor of Austin is warning people to stay home on Friday, as the President's visit is sure to tie up traffic for hours on end.
[03:05:33.688 --> 03:05:37.189]  He will also be utilizing state police and local police resources.
[03:05:37.349 --> 03:05:39.250]  Which could be used during South by Southwest.
[03:05:39.450 --> 03:05:40.711]  He'll be making two stops.
[03:05:41.011 --> 03:05:43.413]  One at the Long Center for Performing Arts to give a speech.
[03:05:43.673 --> 03:05:47.075]  And then jumping across the river to attend a fundraiser at Austin Music Hall.
[03:05:47.295 --> 03:05:52.239]  And then it's on to a private fundraiser at the home of Amy and Kirk Rudy, local developers here.
[03:05:52.459 --> 03:06:02.005]  It was Amy Rudy who approached a local Austin City Council member after he voted against awarding a $37 million tax rebate to her husband's company and said, don't F with my husband.
[03:06:02.165 --> 03:06:03.186]  And she repeated it twice.
[03:06:03.366 --> 03:06:05.167]  These are the kind of people Obama hangs out with.
[03:06:05.387 --> 03:06:08.189]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.

[03:08:17.572 --> 03:08:18.553]  You want answers?
[03:08:18.613 --> 03:08:20.074]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:20.714 --> 03:08:22.575]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:22.695 --> 03:08:27.017]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:27.077 --> 03:08:30.900]  I'm David Knight, and we have Alex Jones joining us, reporting from the road.
[03:08:30.980 --> 03:08:31.380]  Alex?
[03:08:32.661 --> 03:08:33.601]  Absolutely, David.
[03:08:33.641 --> 03:08:38.264]  You know, I am obviously listening to the show via the free iPhone app that's at Infowars.com.
[03:08:38.364 --> 03:08:40.785]  It's my show, along with the Droid app and the rest of it.
[03:08:41.586 --> 03:08:47.129]  And I had just pulled in to the home office to go in and complete some work.
[03:08:48.016 --> 03:08:51.839]  And I heard that report with Joe Biggs and, of course, Terry McBrain.
[03:08:51.899 --> 03:08:56.161]  So I literally, as I was walking in, got on my phone, pulled up the video.
[03:08:56.922 --> 03:08:58.143]  It's on Infowars.com.
[03:08:58.703 --> 03:09:01.325]  And I'm going to put that report right now on YouTube for everybody else as well.
[03:09:02.545 --> 03:09:05.087]  The punch heard around the world.
[03:09:05.707 --> 03:09:09.270]  And, of course, for those who don't know what the shot heard around the world is, there's a lot of new people listening.
[03:09:09.710 --> 03:09:10.691]  A lot of people are Americans.
[03:09:11.611 --> 03:09:11.791]  But in 1775,
[03:09:13.906 --> 03:09:23.388]  The Redcoats came to Lexington and Concord to confiscate the firearms, the gunpowder, and the shot, or the quote, you know, round bullets before they had cartridges.
[03:09:23.969 --> 03:09:24.869]  They came to take the firearms.
[03:09:25.389 --> 03:09:26.709]  That's what really finally kicked off 1776.
[03:09:27.450 --> 03:09:32.031]  Imagine folks out in the middle of nowhere and in the wilderness and, you know, can't have guns now.
[03:09:32.051 --> 03:09:32.631]  That's just crazy.
[03:09:32.891 --> 03:09:34.151]  So that's what started the whole deal.
[03:09:34.491 --> 03:09:36.972]  Well, they're claiming this is the new revolution being started.
[03:09:38.180 --> 03:09:39.421]  George Soros has primed it.
[03:09:39.621 --> 03:09:40.782]  Hundreds of millions of dollars.
[03:09:40.802 --> 03:09:43.024]  $35 million just in Ferguson.
[03:09:43.224 --> 03:09:44.125]  Trying to start a race war.
[03:09:44.165 --> 03:09:45.246]  Trying to fan the flames.
[03:09:45.266 --> 03:09:46.867]  Trying to turn everybody against each other.
[03:09:47.327 --> 03:09:49.249]  Taking some legitimate issues and twisting them.
[03:09:49.649 --> 03:09:53.733]  Others just making stuff up to literally get us at each other's throats.
[03:09:54.173 --> 03:09:56.575]  And they keep sending in these big groups of people.
[03:09:57.706 --> 03:10:09.429]  White, black, Hispanic, and American, but a lot of times, you know, groups of black folks going in to these Trump rallies, screaming, yelling, bumping into people, running over Secret Service people, you name it, saying, quote, it's a social experiment.
[03:10:10.009 --> 03:10:12.949]  And they were just playing the clip where they admitted it's a social experiment.
[03:10:12.969 --> 03:10:20.551]  So they know that if you go to a rally of 25,000 people and run around screaming and yelling, that there's going to be some hothead who's mad.
[03:10:20.851 --> 03:10:22.951]  Maybe he's mad because his job got shipped overseas.
[03:10:22.991 --> 03:10:24.172]  Maybe he is a racist, whatever.
[03:10:24.192 --> 03:10:25.012]  25,000 people.
[03:10:26.640 --> 03:10:31.447]  You're marching past thousands of them, you're bumping into people, you're doing stuff, you're going to get hauled off and hit.
[03:10:31.708 --> 03:10:38.096]  I've actually seen in leftist publications them take the footage from last year at the abortion clinic where Jakar and everybody basically protected me.
[03:10:39.498 --> 03:10:40.420]  And I have seen them.
[03:10:41.748 --> 03:11:02.727]  Play just 30 second clips of me pushing the guy back and Jakari pushing somebody back and Us pushing back and saying look they're attacking people and in the abortion clinic, so that's what they do they link arms They run into you and they say skews us coming through skews us coming through and then they run people on wheelchairs off into the road people
[03:11:03.739 --> 03:11:10.382]  Ron Crutches, a brain-damaged guy named, you know, Ronnie that I've known for 20 years, a local activist, but he was hit by a car.
[03:11:10.402 --> 03:11:13.163]  I mean, he's there, but he literally has trouble walking.
[03:11:14.424 --> 03:11:17.565]  Literally, Jakari and others who were there had to protect him.
[03:11:17.886 --> 03:11:19.166]  I've never seen Jakari get so angry.
[03:11:19.186 --> 03:11:23.988]  He's usually very, very, you know, calm and polite and friendly and restrained.
[03:11:24.028 --> 03:11:24.969]  He got really angry.
[03:11:25.509 --> 03:11:26.609]  See, how dare him do that?
[03:11:26.649 --> 03:11:29.831]  How dare I push back when the guy had already run into me four or five times?
[03:11:30.916 --> 03:11:34.157]  And then he even grabbed my microphone away and broke it, and then ran off.
[03:11:34.418 --> 03:11:39.460]  Okay, the police put him in handcuffs after they caught two of them, but then didn't charge him, okay?
[03:11:40.120 --> 03:11:47.063]  But the point is, then the media spins it that I attacked him, and that my crew attacked him, when they were clearly attacking us.
[03:11:47.143 --> 03:11:48.064]  And that's what these people do.
[03:11:48.084 --> 03:11:52.525]  Excuse us coming through, excuse us coming through, link their arms, we're getting the full footage.
[03:11:52.585 --> 03:11:53.626]  It's what's happened over and over again.
[03:11:54.622 --> 03:11:58.566]  And then they, I mean, run over Secret Service agents, you'll get out of my way, you name it.
[03:11:59.026 --> 03:12:00.087]  Just crazy.
[03:12:00.107 --> 03:12:02.869]  They tried to say that the Secret Service agent was racist.
[03:12:02.889 --> 03:12:05.411]  You know, on and on and on and on.
[03:12:05.932 --> 03:12:07.313]  And that guy looked like he was a mixed race.
[03:12:07.353 --> 03:12:10.916]  But the point is, is that this is an attempt to start a race war in America.
[03:12:10.956 --> 03:12:12.578]  It's what all our inside intel's saying.
[03:12:13.078 --> 03:12:16.281]  It's what intel was telling me six years ago, and I didn't believe it.
[03:12:17.001 --> 03:12:24.527]  Uh, and now it's happening and this is their plan going in to the fall in the general election and maybe even suspend things.
[03:12:24.547 --> 03:12:27.369]  I don't know if they're going to do it, but, but it's, it's, it's in the cards.
[03:12:27.689 --> 03:12:28.950]  They're moving it to the front burner.
[03:12:29.731 --> 03:12:30.491]  This is a big deal.
[03:12:31.011 --> 03:12:32.372]  And I think we should go down.
[03:12:32.392 --> 03:12:36.816]  Obama said yesterday, he said, well, he said today we played the clip earlier.
[03:12:36.836 --> 03:12:37.396]  We should play it again.
[03:12:37.436 --> 03:12:38.617]  He goes, I've united people.
[03:12:39.532 --> 03:12:41.034]  You know, I haven't divided people.
[03:12:41.214 --> 03:12:43.156]  All his surrogates have done is divide people.
[03:12:43.496 --> 03:12:49.102]  And then he gives, every time there's an Easter statement, he goes, well, there's a lot of bad Christians in the world, and it's shameful what Christians are doing.
[03:12:49.462 --> 03:12:53.367]  Meanwhile, you know, radical Muslims are killing millions of people every year, literally.
[03:12:53.787 --> 03:12:55.309]  These people hate us, folks.
[03:12:55.669 --> 03:12:59.413]  And it's time for people that like family, and people that like free speech.
[03:13:00.353 --> 03:13:03.279]  And people that like being Christian or just being in a free country.
[03:13:03.479 --> 03:13:12.215]  We need to have every race, color, and creed come together and see the manipulation that's happening and let these social dividers, these social engineers using literal communist tactics.
[03:13:12.870 --> 03:13:18.252]  To divide and conquer, it's time we realize what rat snakes they are, and true total enemies of this country.
[03:13:18.512 --> 03:13:20.113]  And they are trying to stir stuff up.
[03:13:20.533 --> 03:13:22.994]  They are trying to absolutely infiltrate into these groups.
[03:13:23.454 --> 03:13:32.698]  They come in one by one, and they all link up, 30, 40, 50, 60, 100 people, and then start running people down, and going, excuse me, when they plow into you holding hands.
[03:13:33.178 --> 03:13:36.279]  I have personally had anarchists do this to me four times.
[03:13:36.619 --> 03:13:37.139]  It's on tape.
[03:13:37.399 --> 03:13:39.420]  I've had the devil-worshiping communists do it.
[03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:41.421]  In their own words, devil-worshiping communists.
[03:13:41.969 --> 03:13:56.502]  This is who we're facing, devil-worshipping communists, and then these Black Lives Matter folks are brainwashed in the schools, told they don't have any money or any future, not because of globalism, but because some poor white plumber is at a Donald Trump rally.
[03:13:56.863 --> 03:13:58.264]  They are turning us against each other.
[03:13:58.624 --> 03:14:00.947]  Now, I don't think the people in Black Lives Matter are devil worshippers.
[03:14:01.287 --> 03:14:02.228]  They are brainwashed
[03:14:02.788 --> 03:14:03.149]  We're good.
[03:14:22.139 --> 03:14:25.581]  Syria, the Arab Spring, and what's happening in Ukraine.
[03:14:25.621 --> 03:14:27.723]  These people aren't playing games.
[03:14:27.763 --> 03:14:32.786]  They're causing a worldwide meltdown to bring in one world government.
[03:14:33.286 --> 03:14:36.008]  I'm telling you, I'm going to go find, I'm going to start one of Black Lives Matter meetings.
[03:14:41.826 --> 03:14:42.587]  We're good to go.
[03:15:03.339 --> 03:15:06.142]  Some of these young people, because I've talked to them, they go, oh man, you're just scared.
[03:15:06.182 --> 03:15:07.123]  We're taking over.
[03:15:07.423 --> 03:15:08.544]  That isn't how it works.
[03:15:08.865 --> 03:15:10.326]  The New World Order took over.
[03:15:10.566 --> 03:15:12.408]  It puts poison in your water, silly.
[03:15:12.949 --> 03:15:14.530]  It's the one that doubled your unemployment.
[03:15:14.810 --> 03:15:17.093]  It's the one that wanted to kill everybody in the womb.
[03:15:17.553 --> 03:15:22.378]  It's time now, folks, to say no to the globalist divide-and-conquer race war.
[03:15:22.798 --> 03:15:23.199]  It's time.
[03:15:23.299 --> 03:15:24.160]  And then they'll say, oh,
[03:15:24.901 --> 03:15:29.670]  But Trump wants to control the borders and Trump doesn't want Muslims being brought in.
[03:15:29.810 --> 03:15:30.731]  Until they vet them!
[03:15:31.052 --> 03:15:32.915]  And we gotta have borders as a country.
[03:15:33.136 --> 03:15:35.460]  They take the most basic stuff and act like it's racist.
[03:15:36.192 --> 03:15:37.573]  And then you've got all these groups.
[03:15:37.653 --> 03:15:43.218]  In Cambridge, England, they're taking down a bronze rooster from Africa because it came from Africa.
[03:15:43.258 --> 03:15:44.639]  It was stolen.
[03:15:44.659 --> 03:15:52.845]  They want to take down stuff from the British Empire now, but they don't want to fight the current New World Order empire that Cecil Rhodes set up out of the British Empire.
[03:15:52.905 --> 03:15:54.386]  No, they're actually carrying that out.
[03:15:54.747 --> 03:15:56.248]  So the very empire
[03:15:57.003 --> 03:15:57.183]  Yeah.
[03:16:14.916 --> 03:16:16.936]  They were in there yelling and screaming and pushing people.
[03:16:17.256 --> 03:16:18.777]  Somebody cold cocked one of them.
[03:16:18.977 --> 03:16:20.417]  And so it's the end of the world.
[03:16:20.717 --> 03:16:22.277]  It's the devil whites again.
[03:16:22.537 --> 03:16:23.098]  They're the problem.
[03:16:23.118 --> 03:16:27.118]  Like Bernie Sanders said, if you're white, you don't know what it's like to be poor.
[03:16:27.438 --> 03:16:30.579]  And by the way, we had a lot of videos and a lot of images come in for that contest.
[03:16:30.979 --> 03:16:36.580]  I'm not gonna announce it today, I don't think yet, because they haven't organized them and I want to promote them on Facebook and Twitter, but I want to get a status update on that.
[03:16:36.600 --> 03:16:40.281]  I'll probably announce it Sunday, but InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:16:40.301 --> 03:16:41.521]  And the reason I sound so excited
[03:16:42.754 --> 03:16:44.255]  I might like this when I'm not on air.
[03:16:44.615 --> 03:16:45.896]  It's because this is so desperate.
[03:16:45.916 --> 03:16:46.697]  This is so real.
[03:16:46.957 --> 03:16:47.978]  This is so hardcore.
[03:16:48.138 --> 03:16:49.119]  This is so historic.
[03:16:49.299 --> 03:16:50.300]  This is so over the top.
[03:16:50.580 --> 03:16:52.221]  This is the key time in history, folks.
[03:16:52.890 --> 03:16:53.990]  We get the word out on this.
[03:16:54.070 --> 03:16:57.551]  We can have the enemies move, backfire on them, and defeat the globalists.
[03:16:57.611 --> 03:17:02.532]  But if we don't, they are more, I'm more certain than ever, they're going to go with full attempted civil unrest.
[03:17:02.812 --> 03:17:04.453]  It's already popping up all over Austin.
[03:17:04.933 --> 03:17:05.413]  I've seen it.
[03:17:05.733 --> 03:17:06.413]  Friends have seen it.
[03:17:06.513 --> 03:17:07.714]  It is, it is despicable.
[03:17:07.734 --> 03:17:09.114]  Whites are being attacked everywhere.
[03:17:09.134 --> 03:17:10.574]  It is incredible.
[03:17:10.674 --> 03:17:11.474]  And it's so sad.
[03:17:11.494 --> 03:17:17.556]  It's going to create so much division that Christians mainly, abolitionists and others, work so hard to try to end
[03:17:17.936 --> 03:17:22.841]  And Martin Luther King's work and so many other people's work is being flushed down the toilet by these wicked devils right now.
[03:17:23.361 --> 03:17:29.267]  And the people claiming to be anti-racist are the very globalist controller filth, and they know they're doing it.
[03:17:29.367 --> 03:17:29.887]  Remember that.
[03:17:29.947 --> 03:17:31.569]  Bernie Sanders, all these people.
[03:17:31.589 --> 03:17:33.611]  George Soros, they know what they're doing.
[03:17:33.651 --> 03:17:35.393]  Hillary Clinton, David Knight, back to you.
[03:17:35.993 --> 03:17:39.555]  Yeah, Alex, and of course, as I was coming in this morning, I heard a headline.
[03:17:39.595 --> 03:17:45.698]  It was in the New York Times, Washington Post, talking about how the most dangerous place to be in the world is at a Donald Trump rally.
[03:17:45.718 --> 03:17:47.179]  That's the way they're trying to spin this.
[03:17:47.699 --> 03:17:49.840]  We have an article here from the Washington Examiner.
[03:17:49.920 --> 03:17:53.582]  Brian York says, this is what the protester problem really is.
[03:17:53.642 --> 03:17:59.405]  And he starts out by talking about how many people showed up at the Obama rallies when he was running for president the first time.
[03:17:59.725 --> 03:18:01.886]  Now we have that same situation again with Donald Trump.
[03:18:01.926 --> 03:18:03.087]  Actually, larger crowds.
[03:18:03.447 --> 03:18:04.668]  And he said, there's a difference, though.
[03:18:05.268 --> 03:18:14.591]  When Obama was running, there were not people who were conservatives who were systematically disrupting Senator Obama's rallies, okay, and to dominate the press coverage.
[03:18:14.611 --> 03:18:20.552]  But now the far left is doing that, and he talks about how this works, how he witnessed this at one of the events.
[03:18:21.133 --> 03:18:22.653]  Here's how they do this.
[03:18:22.993 --> 03:18:27.675]  The protesters come to the events, many of them affiliated with Soros' Black Lives Matter movement.
[03:18:28.135 --> 03:18:28.935]  They have a technique.
[03:18:29.275 --> 03:18:35.683]  They come to the rally, they settle into the crowd, then one of them begins yelling loudly, causing the crowd to react usually with a chant of Trump, Trump, Trump.
[03:18:35.743 --> 03:18:42.552]  And then the protester tries to make the inevitable security removal as long and as noisy as possible.
[03:18:43.052 --> 03:18:44.254]  Once they finally get that guy out...
[03:18:44.594 --> 03:18:48.776]  Then they take another protestor, stands up, and repeats the process.
[03:18:49.356 --> 03:18:54.998]  You see, these people are coming in, and it's kind of a way to be passive-aggressive, okay?
[03:18:55.358 --> 03:18:57.559]  But the emphasis is really on the aggressive.
[03:18:57.579 --> 03:18:59.360]  There's not too much that's passive about that.
[03:18:59.700 --> 03:19:00.380]  It's a plan.
[03:19:00.860 --> 03:19:03.101]  They want to make it about the disruption.
[03:19:03.241 --> 03:19:05.002]  That's what they want to make the story about.
[03:19:05.682 --> 03:19:09.706]  They want to try to portray Trump and his followers as fascist.
[03:19:10.166 --> 03:19:13.469]  And of course, that's what this has been about from the very beginning.
[03:19:13.609 --> 03:19:32.205]  As soon as Donald Trump pushed back against the globalist agenda of removing nations, removing national borders, taking down the nations, creating a one world government from that perspective, as well as the trade issues, as well as the climate treaties, which will create a global tax to fund a global governance.
[03:19:33.168 --> 03:19:46.150]  But when he started pushing back against removing the borders, removing nations, because that's what's going on in America as well as Europe, their response was to say racist, because that's always their response.
[03:19:46.630 --> 03:19:49.191]  If they don't have a way to fight you on that, they'll talk about that.
[03:19:49.211 --> 03:19:50.591]  And we're going to go back to your phone calls.
[03:19:50.971 --> 03:20:00.213]  We're also going to talk a little bit about this endorsement by Ben Carson of Donald Trump, because I think one of the things that hasn't been talked about is the excellent health care reform
[03:20:01.433 --> 03:20:18.760]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a SelectQuote agent with a true story of how SelectQuote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[03:20:19.680 --> 03:20:22.461]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:20:23.281 --> 03:20:26.983]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:20:27.643 --> 03:20:28.884]  I said, let me see.
[03:20:29.464 --> 03:20:40.048]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:20:40.528 --> 03:20:51.653]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[03:20:52.611 --> 03:20:53.291]  How about you?

[03:20:55.332 --> 03:20:56.352]  Or go to selectquote.com.
[03:20:56.372 --> 03:20:56.732]  We shop.
[03:20:56.752 --> 03:20:57.012]  You save.

[03:21:09.917 --> 03:21:11.017]  It's completely different.
[03:21:11.117 --> 03:21:12.158]  Try a bottle of it.
[03:21:12.358 --> 03:21:13.779]  Rob Dew joins us.
[03:21:13.939 --> 03:21:16.760]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[03:21:17.041 --> 03:21:18.121]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[03:21:18.141 --> 03:21:19.062]  I've been working all day.
[03:21:19.082 --> 03:21:21.443]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:21:21.583 --> 03:21:22.564]  I get in here at 8 30.
[03:21:22.984 --> 03:21:24.625]  I was kind of run down.
[03:21:24.905 --> 03:21:26.706]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[03:21:26.866 --> 03:21:28.687]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:21:28.707 --> 03:21:30.548]  I got my bottle of Brainforce right there.
[03:21:30.568 --> 03:21:31.329]  I popped two of them.
[03:21:31.629 --> 03:21:33.230]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like,
[03:21:33.890 --> 03:21:35.572]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[03:21:35.592 --> 03:21:37.133]  It's got four and a half stars.
[03:21:37.334 --> 03:21:38.355]  People really love it.
[03:21:38.675 --> 03:21:39.195]  Read about it.

[03:21:48.544 --> 03:21:52.447]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:21:52.607 --> 03:21:58.411]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.

[03:23:08.597 --> 03:23:11.340]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[03:23:11.661 --> 03:23:14.263]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[03:23:14.303 --> 03:23:14.704]  Croix River.
[03:23:15.024 --> 03:23:15.685]  I loved my dad.
[03:23:16.085 --> 03:23:17.046]  The boy was too stubborn.
[03:23:17.267 --> 03:23:19.990]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[03:23:20.230 --> 03:23:20.750]  His excuse?
[03:23:21.111 --> 03:23:22.172]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[03:23:22.452 --> 03:23:23.734]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[03:23:24.054 --> 03:23:24.775]  At less than $107 per month,
[03:23:26.116 --> 03:23:29.543]  LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[03:24:18.352 --> 03:24:19.852]  I'm David Knight, your host for this hour.

[03:25:24.132 --> 03:25:26.295]  Let's go to Tim in Wyoming.
[03:25:26.335 --> 03:25:28.357]  Tim, you wanted to comment on Loretta Lynch.
[03:25:28.377 --> 03:25:28.657]  Go ahead.
[03:25:29.744 --> 03:25:32.345]  Yes, hi David, thanks for taking my call, I appreciate it.
[03:25:32.485 --> 03:25:56.717]  Now, what I wanted to mention was that Loretta Lynch had gone on to, I'm not sure how old this news report was unfortunately, I don't remember the date, but it said that basically the Attorney General had gone on basically stumping, if the term is correct, using the power of her office and CBS's
[03:26:00.191 --> 03:26:20.923]  uh... media uh... media power as well to uh... promote the idea that there was they're just trying to teach what something really easy to do very simple it's just something that anybody should anybody should basically brought out of that you know a lot of this to be done and are you talking about the iphone access to the iphone cameras?
[03:26:20.943 --> 03:26:22.224]  What is it you're talking about?
[03:26:22.284 --> 03:26:23.505]  Correct, correct.
[03:26:23.525 --> 03:26:26.186]  Well basically what I'm talking about is breaking in using the power
[03:26:29.188 --> 03:26:45.223]  Well, using what she was talking about, essentially, was using the power of the public to come in from the other side, using the government on one side and the public on the other side as a pincher movement against free enterprise, against privacy and people's right to privacy.
[03:26:49.810 --> 03:26:55.534]  Yeah, they don't believe we have a right to privacy unless we say that that's the ability to kill our children.
[03:26:56.074 --> 03:26:57.875]  That's the only privacy that they want to give us.
[03:26:58.275 --> 03:27:03.759]  If we want to kill our children and buy into their eugenics movement, okay, we'll call that a right to privacy.
[03:27:03.839 --> 03:27:10.503]  But if you want privacy, the real privacy that is there in the Fourth Amendment, you know,
[03:27:10.803 --> 03:27:15.525]  Privacy and your personal effects, your papers, that sort of thing, which is clearly what this is.
[03:27:15.585 --> 03:27:18.947]  I mean, yeah, they didn't say anything about iPhones and the Constitution.
[03:27:19.327 --> 03:27:20.268]  It's a general principle.
[03:27:20.288 --> 03:27:21.448]  We understand what that's about.
[03:27:21.528 --> 03:27:22.749]  They want to come after us with that.
[03:27:23.229 --> 03:27:24.710]  And of course, there's this article today.
[03:27:25.050 --> 03:27:26.211]  I'll get your comments on this, too.
[03:27:26.231 --> 03:27:30.573]  But the FBI could force us to turn on iPhone cameras and microphones, says Apple.
[03:27:30.613 --> 03:27:33.594]  That's the company's head of services, Eddie Q, talking about that.
[03:27:33.614 --> 03:27:34.555]  He goes, where will this stop?
[03:27:35.180 --> 03:27:38.841]  Well, they do this in a divorce case, in an immigration case, in a tax case.
[03:27:39.241 --> 03:27:42.563]  Someday, somebody will be able to turn on a phone's microphone.
[03:27:42.603 --> 03:27:43.803]  That shouldn't happen in this country.
[03:27:43.823 --> 03:27:46.184]  Well, the news is that they're already doing that, folks.
[03:27:46.764 --> 03:27:49.885]  The NSA has been doing that because they don't really care what the laws are.
[03:27:49.905 --> 03:27:51.146]  They don't care about search warrants.
[03:27:51.586 --> 03:27:59.729]  The FISA court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, that was created to stop the NSA from spying on our conversations.
[03:28:00.569 --> 03:28:03.130]  From illegally wiretapping us without a search warrant.
[03:28:03.170 --> 03:28:08.692]  That was going on prior to the Church and Pike Commission hearings in the 70s.
[03:28:08.752 --> 03:28:17.695]  So they created the FISA Court, and now the FISA Court has become a secret star chamber rubber stamp for these people to do whatever they want to in terms of domestic surveillance.
[03:28:17.715 --> 03:28:18.295]  That's what they do.
[03:28:18.315 --> 03:28:20.036]  They turn everything upside down.
[03:28:20.416 --> 03:28:24.497]  The thing that was meant to constrain them has now become their secret star chamber.
[03:28:25.017 --> 03:28:27.138]  And so that's really what they're going to do, Tim.
[03:28:28.872 --> 03:28:41.842]  Right, like you said, the thing that's meant to constrain them has become their star chamber, but I think the thing, essentially the thing that was meant to constrain them was the American public, the American populace having a brain in their head.
[03:28:42.242 --> 03:28:49.368]  Having an understanding of the Constitution, having an understanding of personal freedom, and having an understanding that the government is only, it's supposed to be
[03:28:50.074 --> 03:28:50.935]  We're good to go.
[03:29:10.642 --> 03:29:15.465]  Somebody throwing a few grains of sand at us and saying, this is how many laws you have to have.
[03:29:15.885 --> 03:29:17.426]  And then it was a handful of sand.
[03:29:17.526 --> 03:29:19.368]  And then it was a bucket full of sand.
[03:29:19.428 --> 03:29:23.910]  And now it's truckloads of sand being dumped straight on top of our heads.
[03:29:24.010 --> 03:29:25.351]  And we can't fight that.
[03:29:25.371 --> 03:29:28.433]  I'll give you another analogy, Tim.
[03:29:28.453 --> 03:29:30.454]  You know, we talk about the federal government.
[03:29:30.494 --> 03:29:31.795]  I call it the feral government.
[03:29:31.835 --> 03:29:33.236]  Like a pack of wild dogs.
[03:29:33.416 --> 03:29:34.397]  I love dogs.
[03:29:34.437 --> 03:29:35.617]  Most people do love dogs.
[03:29:36.858 --> 03:29:39.419]  The federal government is not your pet puppy, okay?
[03:29:39.659 --> 03:29:49.563]  It's more like a bunch of, a pack of wild dogs that used to be domesticated, and now they're running in a wild, feral pack, and they will tear your throat out if you don't stop them.
[03:29:49.603 --> 03:29:54.484]  And we have to find a way to collectively stop them, to collectively stand up for our individual rights.
[03:29:54.504 --> 03:29:54.864]  Stay with us.
[03:29:54.884 --> 03:29:56.285]  We'll be right back with more of your phone calls.
[03:29:58.226 --> 03:29:59.106]  We're on the march.
[03:29:59.606 --> 03:30:01.207]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.147 --> 03:30:04.828]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:08.934 --> 03:30:11.735]  Military drone technology is back in the headlines.
[03:30:12.095 --> 03:30:14.496]  Recently, SCO, a subdivision of the U.S.
[03:30:14.536 --> 03:30:21.539]  military with ties to DARPA, released a video of micro drones being launched from an F-16 fighter at 430 miles per hour.
[03:30:21.839 --> 03:30:28.942]  The Washington Post article titled, Veil of secrecy lifted on Pentagon office planning avatar fighter and drone swarms.
[03:30:29.262 --> 03:30:33.224]  The announcement also represents another step toward total autonomous military robotics
[03:30:33.484 --> 03:30:39.231]  A technology that top experts such as Elon Musk and Max Tegmark have been warning scientists to think twice about.
[03:30:39.391 --> 03:30:44.637]  SEO also said in the same announcement they have successfully developed and tested Avatar flight technology.
[03:30:45.018 --> 03:30:48.422]  Our new project, not previously reported, is called Avatar and calls for
[03:30:48.422 --> 03:30:55.704]  For the Pentagon to pair high-tech fifth-generation fighter jets with unmanned versions of older jets, which would be flown without a pilot, for the first time.
[03:30:56.204 --> 03:31:04.327]  Imagine this technology in the hands of the same government that was also forced to admit this week that it had been using domestic drones for domestic surveillance operations.
[03:31:04.667 --> 03:31:07.788]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:31:08.843 --> 03:31:12.064]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[03:31:12.345 --> 03:31:17.627]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[03:31:17.947 --> 03:31:25.870]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[03:31:26.310 --> 03:31:31.953]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[03:31:32.453 --> 03:31:41.178]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[03:31:41.538 --> 03:31:47.381]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[03:31:47.741 --> 03:31:54.124]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[03:31:54.504 --> 03:31:59.567]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[03:31:59.867 --> 03:32:02.050]  Now available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:02.350 --> 03:32:04.373]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:32:08.459 --> 03:32:08.919]  Hey, everyone!
[03:32:09.279 --> 03:32:11.540]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[03:32:11.580 --> 03:32:15.141]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:32:15.421 --> 03:32:17.002]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:32:17.502 --> 03:32:27.405]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:32:27.765 --> 03:32:33.747]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:32:34.147 --> 03:32:34.548]  We're good to go.
[03:32:49.104 --> 03:32:49.584]  I think so.
[03:33:19.739 --> 03:33:24.314]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:26.954 --> 03:33:28.255]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:28.295 --> 03:33:28.835]  I'm David Knight.
[03:33:28.855 --> 03:33:34.779]  We were just talking to a caller about the iPhone issue and of course the story that's out today.
[03:33:35.539 --> 03:33:47.206]  Apple saying, hey, if we allow them to get away with this, there will be the day when they can demand that we turn on a phone's camera or microphone for them and maybe it'll be something like a divorce case, immigration case, a tax case, who knows.
[03:33:47.986 --> 03:33:50.788]  Look, you have to understand that Apple
[03:33:51.809 --> 03:33:54.711]  And these other products, whether they are cooperating with this or not.
[03:33:54.731 --> 03:33:59.814]  The FBI maybe is, I don't know, they probably have the access to this as well.
[03:33:59.854 --> 03:34:04.037]  Certainly the NSA can look at these phones, with or without Apple's help.
[03:34:04.097 --> 03:34:11.422]  And of course there's been indications through Prism and other things that were leaked from Snowden that they have got back doors into this already.
[03:34:11.522 --> 03:34:14.804]  What they're trying to do is openly create a precedent.
[03:34:15.425 --> 03:34:20.508]  We've had Snowden as well as John McAfee both say, look, I can open that phone for you.
[03:34:21.195 --> 03:34:27.059]  You don't need to force them to create custom software for you, because that's what's really at stake here.
[03:34:27.079 --> 03:34:31.001]  I mean, this is not just going in and grabbing the information.
[03:34:31.121 --> 03:34:36.865]  They want custom software created for them, on demand, the government, so they can spy on us.
[03:34:37.685 --> 03:34:43.394]  It's just incredible how upfront and over-the-top they are to our face about this now.
[03:34:43.454 --> 03:34:47.159]  And of course, remember the Snowden slides that came out?
[03:34:47.199 --> 03:34:48.241]  They were released in Germany.
[03:34:48.281 --> 03:34:52.988]  They didn't get as much press here in the United States, but there was a series of three slides that I thought were very telling.
[03:34:53.749 --> 03:34:55.850]  There was a picture and it said, remember back in 1984?
[03:34:56.310 --> 03:35:06.095]  And they showed the iconic 1984 commercial that Apple aired during the Super Bowl in 1984 to talk about the Mac that was going to be produced.
[03:35:06.776 --> 03:35:08.016]  And they showed that the first time.
[03:35:08.036 --> 03:35:08.897]  Remember back in 1984?
[03:35:09.277 --> 03:35:09.897]  Who would have thought in 1984?
[03:35:09.997 --> 03:35:11.538]  Because that's when the Mac came out.
[03:35:11.558 --> 03:35:14.800]  That's when that commercial aired and that was what it related to.
[03:35:15.480 --> 03:35:18.301]  Who would have thought that this would become Big Brother?
[03:35:18.622 --> 03:35:22.343]  And they show a picture of Steve Jobs holding up the iPhone.
[03:35:22.383 --> 03:35:22.824]  And of course,
[03:35:23.956 --> 03:35:24.917]  It's not just the iPhone.
[03:35:25.197 --> 03:35:27.358]  It's all of the phone manufacturers.
[03:35:27.679 --> 03:35:31.962]  And then the third one was, and that people would line up to pay for it.
[03:35:32.582 --> 03:35:33.503]  See, that's the key.
[03:35:34.003 --> 03:35:37.846]  You are buying your own surveillance technology.
[03:35:38.606 --> 03:35:43.610]  And now we've got a Senate bill that will impose fines on tech companies that refuse to unlock smartphones.
[03:35:43.650 --> 03:35:52.296]  There you go, there's Dianne Feinstein, our favorite statist, coming up with a bill to try to penalize people like Apple on this issue.
[03:35:54.070 --> 03:35:54.930]  Here's what's going to happen.
[03:35:55.450 --> 03:36:01.592]  These things are either going to go away or people are going to find software that is going to continue to defeat the encryption.
[03:36:01.612 --> 03:36:04.433]  You'll never be completely safe as long as you have these devices.
[03:36:04.473 --> 03:36:07.213]  You need to understand what's involved with the Internet of Things.
[03:36:07.754 --> 03:36:14.495]  And you need to understand how far more dangerous this is going to be once they begin to do this to your cars.
[03:36:15.095 --> 03:36:19.256]  Connectivity, as they call it, is the big push right now with all the car manufacturers.
[03:36:19.296 --> 03:36:20.597]  Yeah, it's a feature they can sell to you.
[03:36:21.357 --> 03:36:23.899]  It's a feature the government will mandate to you.
[03:36:24.919 --> 03:36:29.442]  It's a new thing, so it goes along with the self-driving cars and so forth and so on.
[03:36:29.482 --> 03:36:35.446]  You can sit there and they can spy on you while you tweet and go through Facebook.
[03:36:35.486 --> 03:36:37.647]  But it's all about tracking you.
[03:36:37.687 --> 03:36:39.548]  We've tried to make this abundantly clear.
[03:36:39.588 --> 03:36:41.089]  We've talked about this repetitively.
[03:36:42.530 --> 03:36:48.674]  And fastest growing area of the military industrial complex is geospatial intelligence.
[03:36:49.374 --> 03:36:50.795]  Geospatial intelligence.
[03:36:50.855 --> 03:36:55.678]  James Clapper was the head of the geospatial intelligence within the government.
[03:36:55.698 --> 03:36:57.899]  He's been a keynote speaker at their trade organizations.
[03:36:57.939 --> 03:37:01.061]  There's the biggest meetings that they have within the intelligence community.
[03:37:01.801 --> 03:37:05.322]  It's all about activity-based intelligence, human domain analytics.
[03:37:05.342 --> 03:37:06.223]  Does that sound familiar?
[03:37:06.263 --> 03:37:07.463]  Mastering the human domain.
[03:37:07.483 --> 03:37:08.564]  We talked about Jade Helm.
[03:37:08.764 --> 03:37:16.927]  They want to know who you are, who you know, what you do, where you are, what your political beliefs are, what your religious beliefs are.
[03:37:16.967 --> 03:37:24.730]  They want to map this into a great big geographical map overlaying you and your beliefs with the geography.
[03:37:25.737 --> 03:37:26.898]  And that's why they want the metadata.
[03:37:26.938 --> 03:37:31.201]  They kept telling us, oh, it's just metadata, it's not important, we're not actually transcribing your phone calls.
[03:37:31.221 --> 03:37:31.701]  You know what?
[03:37:31.841 --> 03:37:35.324]  The metadata tells them more than your phone conversations.
[03:37:35.344 --> 03:37:37.845]  They don't really care about transcribing your phone conversations.
[03:37:38.286 --> 03:37:39.607]  They want your metadata.
[03:37:39.807 --> 03:37:41.808]  That's the activity-based intelligence.
[03:37:42.368 --> 03:37:51.094]  And once they do that, they're going to analyze you, fit you into the human domain, and then they're going to map you on their, put you on a real map.
[03:37:51.114 --> 03:37:52.976]  That's what the geospatial intelligence is about.
[03:37:53.696 --> 03:37:55.617]  It is total spectrum dominance.
[03:37:55.897 --> 03:37:57.457]  It is total tyranny.
[03:37:58.018 --> 03:38:00.258]  They will control your movements with these cars.
[03:38:00.298 --> 03:38:02.499]  They will tax and track everything you do.
[03:38:02.939 --> 03:38:11.602]  The Internet of Things is dangerous enough, but when they create vehicle-to-infrastructure communication devices that are going to be mandated on your cars pretty soon, nobody else is talking about it.
[03:38:11.842 --> 03:38:12.983]  We need to get this out.
[03:38:13.143 --> 03:38:14.603]  People need to start talking about this.
[03:38:15.003 --> 03:38:19.405]  Vehicle-to-vehicle communication devices as well as vehicle-to-infrastructure.
[03:38:19.565 --> 03:38:27.347]  They're going to be talking not only to the stop signs to give you tickets, not only to the speeding signs, which will be basically issuing you tickets, but to your insurance company.
[03:38:27.707 --> 03:38:29.887]  They'll be talking to the NSA, the FBI.
[03:38:30.207 --> 03:38:34.948]  And once they put all this stuff together, they're going to be looking for patterns of behavior.
[03:38:34.968 --> 03:38:36.289]  And that's when it gets really dangerous.
[03:38:36.309 --> 03:38:46.831]  That's when you get into your minority report type of situation, where they look at you and by an algorithm, they identify you as an enemy of the state.
[03:38:48.311 --> 03:38:49.873]  We can't let this happen.
[03:38:50.514 --> 03:38:51.556]  People have to wake up.
[03:38:51.656 --> 03:38:56.643]  And the best hope that I've seen is this article that we covered a couple of days ago.
[03:38:57.591 --> 03:39:09.319]  Well, they did a survey of people, talked specifically to a lot of younger people, millennials, people in their early to mid-twenties who said, hey, I don't want a self-driving car.
[03:39:09.619 --> 03:39:11.200]  I don't want this thing taking over my life.
[03:39:11.440 --> 03:39:14.262]  I don't want the government controlling and monitoring my movements.
[03:39:14.602 --> 03:39:20.886]  And I don't want something that can be taken over in a malicious way by an individual or by a group of people.
[03:39:21.507 --> 03:39:23.888]  Let me go to Jim in Minnesota.
[03:39:23.968 --> 03:39:24.629]  Jim, go ahead.
[03:39:26.483 --> 03:39:27.003]  Hi David.
[03:39:27.604 --> 03:39:28.124]  Hi.
[03:39:28.344 --> 03:39:30.985]  I just want to say hi to Alex Jones as well.
[03:39:31.265 --> 03:39:31.986]  I know he's listening.
[03:39:34.227 --> 03:39:37.188]  You know, I wish you guys would do something for me, a request.
[03:39:38.589 --> 03:39:51.515]  You really opened my eyes back about three or four months ago with your video of General Michael Hayden and his smug look on his face talking to some class of snoopers about how it
[03:39:52.583 --> 03:39:58.406]  They don't just listen to, you know, terrorist calls, and he smiles, he goes, we listen to interesting people.
[03:39:58.586 --> 03:39:59.267]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:39:59.947 --> 03:40:12.634]  Now, how this guy, right before Super Tuesday a couple weeks ago, got on every single news show as some sort of commentator, and it was all the same line to whoever the host was, was anti-Trump.
[03:40:13.315 --> 03:40:17.817]  That brings me back in my mind to, well, maybe in 2010 or 11 or 12 or 13, when this guy was the head of the NSA,
[03:40:22.193 --> 03:40:30.177]  And he so joyously loves snooping on people and he's so thrilled with it that maybe they were listening to Donald Trump.
[03:40:30.957 --> 03:40:32.858]  So, why the news networks?
[03:40:33.378 --> 03:40:35.059]  Oh, you can bet they listen to Donald Trump.
[03:40:35.079 --> 03:40:38.000]  Yeah, well, they listen to all of us, but you can bet they listen to Donald Trump, yeah.
[03:40:38.638 --> 03:40:40.159]  Well, he's interesting, wouldn't you say?
[03:40:40.179 --> 03:40:40.860]  Oh yeah!
[03:40:42.001 --> 03:40:44.663]  I would say Jesse Ventura is very interesting, too.
[03:40:45.424 --> 03:40:50.649]  Now, that's what stopped me from wanting to ever be a politician in my life, because I knew about this years ago.
[03:40:51.189 --> 03:41:03.981]  Every email, every text, everything you go to on a website, now it's going somewhere, and whenever the New World Order, the globalist people want to destroy a person, they can do it through the press, they can do it through just an oppositional candidate,
[03:41:04.691 --> 03:41:08.676]  They can know information about you that is supposed to be completely private.
[03:41:08.896 --> 03:41:13.562]  It's destroyed my belief that I could have been something politically in this country.
[03:41:13.642 --> 03:41:15.083]  I have just given up that hope.
[03:41:15.604 --> 03:41:19.849]  They can do that, Jim, to Supreme Court justices.
[03:41:19.889 --> 03:41:21.089]  Yes, and I believe that they have.
[03:41:21.149 --> 03:41:29.132]  I mean, we've had a couple of indications that they had looked at Ruth Bader Ginsburg as well as John Roberts.
[03:41:29.192 --> 03:41:37.895]  And we had said a long time ago, when you look at this Obamacare decision, saying that a mandate to buy something was constitutional for the federal government to impose on us.
[03:41:38.715 --> 03:41:41.076]  I mean, absolutely not constitutional.
[03:41:41.216 --> 03:41:42.576]  On its face, we understood that.
[03:41:42.956 --> 03:41:54.440]  But what was strange about it was that John Roberts wrote an opinion that says no, a mandate is not constitutional, and then he wrote the majority opinion, reversed himself completely, and said no, it is.
[03:41:55.109 --> 03:42:02.253]  I don't know of any other situation where you've had a justice write both the dissenting and the concurring opinion of the majority.
[03:42:02.653 --> 03:42:15.721]  And so a lot of us believed, since the other one was written first and the word on the street was, no, it's going to be 5-4 against a mandate, and then all of a sudden it became 5-4 for a mandate, most of us believed that he was blackmailed as well.
[03:42:17.712 --> 03:42:23.657]  It's quite possible, but he is a globalist and he's probably a former CFR member and all that, just to be in that position.
[03:42:23.797 --> 03:42:42.232]  But, the favor I have that I would ask your, you know, InfoWars Nightly News Show is, when it comes to General Michael Hayden, can you, from now on, whenever you use clips of him, instead of using General in front of his name, because that's supposed to be an honorary title, this guy's a nerdy pipsqueak,
[03:42:47.915 --> 03:42:53.834]  And just put instead of general just scratch it out and put world's best known peeping Tom.
[03:42:55.285 --> 03:42:55.525]  Yeah.
[03:42:55.845 --> 03:42:58.928]  General Michael Hayden, comma, peeping Tom.
[03:42:59.648 --> 03:43:00.268]  That's a good idea.
[03:43:00.309 --> 03:43:10.035]  And you know, the other thing from that Washington and Lee speech that really stuck out to me was the, and I can't remember, I think it's section 213 that they claim gives them authority to violate the constitution.
[03:43:10.055 --> 03:43:11.736]  He said, hey, I didn't need that.
[03:43:12.437 --> 03:43:15.979]  I had orders from the president sneering at everybody.
[03:43:16.039 --> 03:43:16.299]  Okay.
[03:43:16.520 --> 03:43:23.584]  And then as you're pointing out, just before Super Tuesday, they trot him out to criticize Donald Trump on waterboarding position.
[03:43:23.925 --> 03:43:24.185]  Okay.
[03:43:24.705 --> 03:43:39.575]  This is the guy who, first he was head of the NSA appointed by Clinton, then George W. Bush appointed him head of the CIA, and under his watch was when we had the enhanced interrogation that they called the torture techniques.
[03:43:39.855 --> 03:43:41.917]  So here's the guy who actually did the torture.
[03:43:42.737 --> 03:43:49.222]  Calling out somebody who thinks that, hey, I think that's an effective tactic, maybe we ought to change the laws and bring it back, okay?
[03:43:49.582 --> 03:44:00.230]  Putting himself on a moral high horse, but also, I think, trying to give himself some plausible deniability, trying to isolate and insulate himself from being an international war criminal.
[03:44:00.230 --> 03:44:00.450]  Yeah, right.
[03:44:24.185 --> 03:44:26.726]  I want to go to a special report before we go to any more calls.
[03:44:26.746 --> 03:44:28.507]  This is something that I think is very interesting.
[03:44:28.527 --> 03:44:38.491]  We had a caller earlier talking about in the debate last night how John Kasich again showed that he was a neocon warmonger just like Ted Cruz, just like Marco Rubio.
[03:44:38.731 --> 03:44:41.513]  Anywhere they can, they want to get into a conflict.
[03:44:41.553 --> 03:44:45.094]  And of course, the first thing they want to do is to project strength.
[03:44:45.154 --> 03:44:46.375]  We don't want to talk to anybody.
[03:44:46.815 --> 03:44:50.537]  If you want to talk to somebody, then, you know, you're a friend of a communist.
[03:44:50.577 --> 03:44:53.499]  You don't want to try to de-escalate a situation.
[03:44:53.859 --> 03:44:57.581]  No, we want to have a no-fly zone declared over Syria.
[03:44:57.641 --> 03:44:59.602]  We don't want to get the approval of the U.S.
[03:44:59.642 --> 03:45:03.204]  Congress, as Leon Panetta said when he was questioned by Senator Sessions.
[03:45:03.264 --> 03:45:07.106]  And Senator Sessions said, well, who's going to give you that permission in your mind?
[03:45:07.126 --> 03:45:09.087]  He goes, well, we'd go to the U.N.
[03:45:09.127 --> 03:45:10.148]  or we would go to NATO.
[03:45:10.208 --> 03:45:13.069]  And he goes, I can't believe what I just heard, said Senator Sessions.
[03:45:13.110 --> 03:45:15.391]  You were a congressman, Leon Panetta.
[03:45:15.931 --> 03:45:17.292]  You know what the Constitution says.
[03:45:17.332 --> 03:45:19.434]  You're supposed to get that authorization from Congress.
[03:45:19.754 --> 03:45:21.716]  They don't want the authorization from Congress.
[03:45:21.776 --> 03:45:25.659]  They want to take orders from the globalist regimes that they have set up.
[03:45:26.240 --> 03:45:30.623]  They want these wars to promote globalism, to promote their wars for profit.
[03:45:31.324 --> 03:45:33.786]  And they are not concerned about our safety.
[03:45:33.806 --> 03:45:36.248]  If they were, they wouldn't continue to create these wars.
[03:45:36.288 --> 03:45:38.670]  Let's take a look at what's going on in the Korean Peninsula.
[03:45:38.690 --> 03:45:40.852]  We've got a special report from Rob Jacobson.
[03:45:42.136 --> 03:45:47.218]  Tensions between North Korea and the Western world are escalating once again.
[03:45:47.518 --> 03:45:55.021]  This time, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea threatened a preemptive and offensive nuclear strike.
[03:45:55.341 --> 03:46:00.123]  This statement was made in response to joint U.S.-South Korea exercises.
[03:46:00.603 --> 03:46:04.205]  Operations Key Resolve and Full Eagle have begun.
[03:46:04.525 --> 03:46:07.246]  And they will continue until April 30th.
[03:46:07.646 --> 03:46:32.333]  The state-run North Korean Central News Agency published a statement that says, As the joint military exercises to be staged by the enemies are regarded as the most undisguised nuclear war drills aimed to infringe upon the sovereignty of the DPRK, its military counteraction will be more preemptive and offensive nuclear strikes.
[03:46:33.073 --> 03:46:37.096]  Meanwhile, the White House says they are closely monitoring the situation.
[03:46:37.256 --> 03:46:50.747]  We urge North Korea to refrain from proactive actions and statements that aggravate tensions and instead focus on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments, said a senior administration official.
[03:46:51.107 --> 03:46:58.010]  Saber rattling is not uncommon for North Korea, especially around this time for annual military exercises.
[03:46:58.311 --> 03:47:07.095]  CNN's international correspondent Paula Hancock says they have threatened this before and these kinds of threats are to be expected this time of year.
[03:47:07.795 --> 03:47:15.977]  Well, Amra, I think this has certainly been expected because this is going to be the first day of those joint military drills between the US and South Korea.
[03:47:16.537 --> 03:47:19.358]  Every single year these irritate Pyongyang.
[03:47:19.398 --> 03:47:25.960]  They see them as a dress rehearsal to an invasion, which is why every year we see the rhetoric increasing.
[03:47:26.560 --> 03:47:30.605]  Of course, this year it's more tense than usual because of the backdrop.
[03:47:30.965 --> 03:47:33.828]  Of course, we have the UN sanctions that were just passed last week.
[03:47:33.948 --> 03:47:38.834]  And as of now, the situation has been escalating at an alarming rate.
[03:47:39.094 --> 03:47:45.001]  In January 2016, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb.
[03:47:46.460 --> 03:47:54.028]  On January 6th, 2016, at 10 a.m., the first hydrogen bomb test was successfully conducted.
[03:48:04.773 --> 03:48:12.456]  In February, North Korea claims to have successfully launched an Earth satellite into orbit using a long-range missile.
[03:48:12.676 --> 03:48:25.602]  Earlier this month, the UN Security Council voted to impose sanctions on North Korea, soon after a North Korean ship was impounded in the Philippines as part of these new UN sanctions.
[03:48:25.842 --> 03:48:30.844]  Kim Jong-un responded by saying that he needs to be ready for nuclear conflict.
[03:48:31.164 --> 03:48:35.128]  Nuclear warheads need to be ready for use at any time.
[03:48:35.428 --> 03:48:38.011]  And that's a direct quote from Kim Jong-un.
[03:48:38.271 --> 03:48:38.492]  U.S.
[03:48:38.532 --> 03:48:44.258]  officials say they are considering these threats true because they cannot risk underestimating them.
[03:48:44.538 --> 03:48:45.499]  They can say that again.
[03:48:45.759 --> 03:48:49.763]  We will keep a close eye on this as the story continues to unfold.
[03:48:50.043 --> 03:48:53.187]  Stay tuned for updates at InfoWars.com.
[03:48:54.622 --> 03:48:57.366]  Great report from Rob Jacobson and Darren McBrain.
[03:48:57.386 --> 03:48:58.908]  And of course, war is the lifeblood of the state.
[03:48:58.928 --> 03:49:02.332]  That's why the North Korean dictator likes to brag about it so much.
[03:49:02.893 --> 03:49:11.645]  And it's why our candidates for office, from Hillary Clinton to the Republicans, for the most part, especially John Kasich last night, they always want to
[03:49:12.165 --> 03:49:21.493]  Push into an area like the Ukraine, like the Middle East, always trying to create a situation because that makes them more powerful.
[03:49:21.753 --> 03:49:25.517]  It makes the people that put them in office, the warmongers, the neocons, it makes them the money.
[03:49:25.537 --> 03:49:32.843]  And of course, Ted Cruz has an entire closet full of neocon advisors.
[03:49:32.883 --> 03:49:35.605]  He keeps them in the closet while he openly trashes them.
[03:49:37.167 --> 03:49:41.490]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:49:41.810 --> 03:49:45.953]  Thank you, David.
[03:49:48.574 --> 03:49:52.177]  You know, that's right, about what you were saying with Ted.
[03:49:52.537 --> 03:50:01.343]  I heard it from Kasich, too, regards to Rossell, you know, ABBE, nuclear technology, the North Korea back during the Clinton administration.
[03:50:01.943 --> 03:50:02.504]  Nothing new.
[03:50:02.884 --> 03:50:04.205]  He's got all the intelligence.
[03:50:04.345 --> 03:50:05.225]  Sounds really hip.
[03:50:06.835 --> 03:50:26.906]  I'm thinking if Donald understood and had access to the Bilderberg leaks from 1966, pretty much a Wikileaks-sized data dump, he would also understand the skeleton key to world foreign policy and white papers and the scheme.
[03:50:28.667 --> 03:50:33.530]  In fact, they're going to have one in 016, probably in North America, 08, 012, same location.
[03:50:35.416 --> 03:50:36.297]  Maybe so.
[03:50:36.557 --> 03:50:40.139]  That'd be great if he went with those papers and protested with us.
[03:50:40.959 --> 03:50:45.662]  But what's the odds of him finding any importance from those documents?
[03:50:45.722 --> 03:50:46.702]  Are you familiar with them?
[03:50:47.183 --> 03:50:50.364]  Yeah, are you saying that you would like to see Donald Trump go protest, Bilderberg?
[03:50:50.384 --> 03:50:51.025]  Is that what you're saying?
[03:50:52.864 --> 03:51:06.134]  No, that he would be intelligent enough to know what's going on through the document leaked from... You know, I have more confidence than any other presidential candidate I've seen in my lifetime that he knows what's going on.
[03:51:06.174 --> 03:51:09.717]  He's talking about 9-11 and releasing sticker papers.
[03:51:09.737 --> 03:51:10.778]  Stay with us, we'll stay right back.
[03:51:10.818 --> 03:51:16.442]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[03:51:16.602 --> 03:51:21.066]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.

[03:52:10.641 --> 03:52:14.083]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:52:14.424 --> 03:52:21.548]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:52:22.169 --> 03:52:30.534]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:52:30.775 --> 03:52:34.897]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:52:35.178 --> 03:52:40.341]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[03:52:40.781 --> 03:52:44.602]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:52:45.022 --> 03:52:48.203]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:52:48.423 --> 03:52:59.526]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:52:59.566 --> 03:53:02.226]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[03:53:02.486 --> 03:53:08.428]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[03:53:12.133 --> 03:53:16.495]  Hey, I rode the elevator with you, but I don't work on the upper floors.
[03:53:16.915 --> 03:53:23.437]  I just want to squeeze in there right next to you, so the RFID scanner in my pocket can capture all your personal information.
[03:53:23.777 --> 03:53:26.878]  Your debit and credit cards, even your work ID badge.
[03:53:27.279 --> 03:53:29.659]  So your identity is now my identity.
[03:53:30.220 --> 03:53:30.660]  Going up.
[03:53:31.600 --> 03:53:39.521]  So am I. For over 10 years, ID Stronghold has pioneered RFID-blocking wallets and ID badge holders for consumers, the U.S.
[03:53:39.581 --> 03:53:42.322]  military, and even the Executive Office of the President.
[03:53:42.862 --> 03:53:44.362]  Shouldn't you be protected too?
[03:53:45.002 --> 03:53:49.663]  ID Stronghold wallets cost about the same as wallets in most stores, but give you extra protection.

[03:53:53.004 --> 03:53:54.864]  Don't be a victim of electronic pickpocketing.
[03:53:55.064 --> 03:53:59.245]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID Stronghold wallets, card sleeves, and purses.

[03:54:20.276 --> 03:54:21.677]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:21.697 --> 03:54:24.459]  I'm David Knight, and we're going to go back to your calls in just a moment.
[03:54:24.559 --> 03:54:29.102]  Just want to let you know that we have Brain Force as well as Supermail Vitality back in stock.
[03:54:29.122 --> 03:54:30.382]  They've been out of stock for a while.
[03:54:30.422 --> 03:54:32.904]  Now you can stock up on them while they're here.
[03:54:32.924 --> 03:54:36.746]  Brain Force is something that I use very frequently.
[03:54:36.827 --> 03:54:43.451]  Unlike energy drinks and supplements, it uses natural brain activation ingredients like Yerba Mate extract and Alpha GPC.
[03:54:44.351 --> 03:54:47.833]  It's my favorite product that we have here at Infowarslife.com.
[03:54:47.873 --> 03:54:50.195]  Right now you can get that as well as Super Metal Vitality.
[03:54:50.475 --> 03:54:52.456]  They have been out of stock because they're so popular.
[03:54:52.816 --> 03:54:54.037]  You can look at the reviews.

[03:55:47.482 --> 03:55:53.267]  I want to go back to our callers, but before I do, real quickly, there was an article up on the Drudge Report today that I thought was kind of interesting.
[03:55:54.272 --> 03:55:57.814]  Inside Hollywood's quiet and growing support for Donald Trump.
[03:55:57.894 --> 03:56:01.437]  Now they talk about how they have to meet in secret.
[03:56:01.737 --> 03:56:04.259]  They say at an undisclosed location somewhere in the L.A.
[03:56:04.399 --> 03:56:04.679]  area.
[03:56:05.099 --> 03:56:15.546]  About 200 members of Hollywood's private group of conservative Republicans known as Friends of Abe gathered to watch Thursday's GOP debate between Trump, Cruz, Rubio and Kasich.
[03:56:15.646 --> 03:56:16.887]  Okay, it was an invitation only.
[03:56:17.548 --> 03:56:20.490]  Nobody gets to know where the location is or who's there.
[03:56:20.530 --> 03:56:21.170]  Why is that?
[03:56:21.490 --> 03:56:21.810]  Why is that?
[03:56:21.830 --> 03:56:23.732]  You know, because... And here's the irony.
[03:56:24.432 --> 03:56:26.954]  Hollywood loves to talk about McCarthyism.
[03:56:27.615 --> 03:56:28.615]  And they should, okay?
[03:56:29.796 --> 03:56:32.278]  But, they're guilty of the same thing themselves.
[03:56:32.298 --> 03:56:36.741]  I mean, we just had another movie, yet another movie come out about McCarthyism called Trumbo, okay?
[03:56:36.842 --> 03:56:40.945]  They can't leave that alone while they're doing it themselves.
[03:56:42.853 --> 03:56:48.038]  That's what I liked about the recent Coen Brothers movie, Hail Caesar.
[03:56:48.639 --> 03:56:53.564]  They show the hypocrisy of the Hollywood communists as part of that.
[03:56:53.684 --> 03:56:59.450]  And I'm not going to give away any spoilers on it, but it really was an homage to old-style Hollywood.
[03:57:00.130 --> 03:57:14.960]  And they basically nailed everything that was going on in the 50s, from all the different genres to the backdrop of radicalism being used through the movies to manipulate people and also the hypocrisy of that within Hollywood.
[03:57:14.980 --> 03:57:15.601]  And here we see it.
[03:57:16.161 --> 03:57:25.666]  You know, you can't talk about the fact that you're Republican, and then within the Republicans, it's like, oh, Trump, yeah, I can't say it, I support him, but I can't say it, you know?
[03:57:26.367 --> 03:57:29.748]  That kind of peer pressure, that kind of, really, McCarthyism.
[03:57:30.289 --> 03:57:34.091]  And when I look at the endorsement from Ben Carson, hopefully now,
[03:57:35.151 --> 03:57:37.453]  Hopefully they'll start to talk about Obamacare.
[03:57:38.494 --> 03:57:43.258]  It's absolutely amazing when you look at these debates, especially the one before that.
[03:57:43.838 --> 03:57:52.205]  Donald Trump had just released this health program, and we talked about it while we were doing the live coverage, as an excellent replacement of Obamacare.
[03:57:52.385 --> 03:57:53.746]  First of all, he gets rid of the mandate.
[03:57:54.026 --> 03:57:56.068]  That's the worst thing about Obamacare.
[03:57:56.388 --> 03:58:04.074]  Then what he does, and this is what little Marco criticized him so much, he said, let the insurance companies compete across state lines.
[03:58:04.855 --> 03:58:19.646]  Okay, why would you support, and I'm talking to Ted Cruz, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, why would you support so-called free trade globally and yet restrict trade and insurance policies within the United States?
[03:58:19.786 --> 03:58:24.170]  Again, like everything we have, just like the FISA court, it's upside down.
[03:58:25.242 --> 03:58:27.384]  They talk about free trade, but they won't allow it in the United States.
[03:58:27.424 --> 03:58:32.767]  So hopefully they'll have that, and I think Donald Trump is right when he said we've had enough of these Republican debates.
[03:58:33.348 --> 03:58:33.988]  They're boring.
[03:58:34.328 --> 03:58:35.749]  They aren't asking any questions.
[03:58:35.769 --> 03:58:37.431]  They're not asking any substantive questions.
[03:58:37.751 --> 03:58:38.912]  It's time to move on.
[03:58:39.212 --> 03:58:40.533]  And that's it for today's show.
[03:58:40.573 --> 03:58:41.754]  Sorry to the callers we didn't get to.
[03:58:41.774 --> 03:58:43.315]  Join us tonight, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:43.355 --> 03:58:44.876]  Eastern, for the Infowars Nightly News.
