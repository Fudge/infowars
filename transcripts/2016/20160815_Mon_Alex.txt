[00:00:20.231 --> 00:00:25.114]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.194 --> 00:00:33.579]  I shot a special report over the weekend detailing the United Nations admission.
[00:00:46.855 --> 00:00:55.621]  That it is using Islamic migrant invasions of Europe to overthrow Western culture in their own words.
[00:00:58.963 --> 00:01:03.426]  And then now we have hacked emails of George Soros.
[00:01:05.368 --> 00:01:08.590]  And by the way, more and more this is coming out of patriots inside the US government.
[00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.270]  We now know that.
[00:01:10.287 --> 00:01:11.147]  Not just the Russians.
[00:01:11.888 --> 00:01:15.830]  The whole world is against the Democrats and Soros that have hijacked the United States.
[00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.894]  The world knows that Spectre, the Quantum Group, has hijacked this superpower.
[00:01:27.496 --> 00:01:33.739]  In the new James Bond movie, the villain has a private corporation called the Quantum Group and they admit he's supposed to be George Soros.
[00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:39.702]  And that film was approved by MI6.
[00:01:40.622 --> 00:01:45.384]  MI6 has product placement out telling you George Soros is Spectre.
[00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:50.245]  And I'm not saying MI6 is perfect.
[00:01:50.265 --> 00:01:53.767]  The point is they've been hijacked to a great extent by people like this and all over the world.
[00:01:54.507 --> 00:01:54.927]  Not just...
[00:01:56.613 --> 00:02:00.877]  Citizens but agencies understand how much danger everyone is in.
[00:02:01.477 --> 00:02:09.784]  Just like in the 1942-43, the German General Staff turned against Hitler because they knew where this was going.
[00:02:09.824 --> 00:02:11.246]  It wasn't that they were even good guys.
[00:02:12.086 --> 00:02:17.371]  They just didn't want to go off the edge of a cliff and take Deutschland with them.
[00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:30.456]  But now Soros Group funded opposition research on critics of radical Islam and researched how to shut them down.
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:44.028]  And then of course they've got all these leftist publications and groups putting out movies and films demonizing yours truly, calling me a racist and saying I'm an Islamophobe.
[00:02:44.648 --> 00:02:49.833]  Because as a classical liberal, I am against that type of incredible oppression.
[00:02:50.925 --> 00:03:00.709]  Globalist Unite Breitbart reports, Hillary Clinton running mate Tim Kaine dines with George Soros' son as Donald Trump rise terrifies world elite.
[00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:01.749]  In fact, will you print me that again?
[00:03:06.351 --> 00:03:10.213]  We've broken hundreds and hundreds of very, very serious stories.
[00:03:12.154 --> 00:03:15.135]  And whereas they'll persecute a mainstream media reporter,
[00:03:16.553 --> 00:03:17.794]  Or go after a journalist.
[00:03:18.054 --> 00:03:19.774]  And we've seen record persecution of the press.
[00:03:20.295 --> 00:03:29.438]  They don't know how to handle info wars because if they come after me, it will just certify and embolden and emblazon and highlight everything I've ever said or done.
[00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.520]  Because they know what I'm saying is so accurate.
[00:03:34.844 --> 00:03:42.970]  Because it's from their own white papers, that if they ever put more attention on what we're doing here, it is basically the Death Star plans.
[00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:45.372]  And then we can blow the Death Star up politically.
[00:03:45.993 --> 00:03:49.876]  That's an allegory, obviously for the New York Times, before they say, I believe there's really a Death Star.
[00:03:51.597 --> 00:04:01.184]  So, we already have the plans, we're just sitting here with them, made films, written countless articles, had countless guests on, documenting the battle plan, and folks are listening!
[00:04:01.204 --> 00:04:04.327]  Not just the general public, but people all over the world, and
[00:04:05.626 --> 00:04:07.667]  Intelligence agencies, private groups, you name it.
[00:04:09.548 --> 00:04:25.396]  The floodgates are basically open where we're getting intel that time and time again turns out to be dead on accurate on what's really going on inside this globalist takeover.
[00:04:26.076 --> 00:04:32.880]  And I got information this morning that I'm still processing mentally, and it comes from a good source.
[00:04:35.612 --> 00:04:47.869]  That was doing diplomatic detail security for someone even above Soros being brought in to meet with Hillary.
[00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.014]  And this guy was shooting his mouth off.
[00:04:52.335 --> 00:04:56.557]  Just right there in front of the security people, and they could not believe what they heard.
[00:04:56.857 --> 00:04:57.877]  And that's what's so scary.
[00:04:58.278 --> 00:05:00.258]  Man, these globalists are arrogant.
[00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:07.862]  And they were talking about staging a false flag on Hillary, a false assassination on Hillary, and blaming it on Trump.
[00:05:15.126 --> 00:05:22.571]  On July 30th, Alex Jones made a request that Donald Trump make rigged elections one of the central campaign issues.
[00:05:23.311 --> 00:05:28.654]  On August 1st, Donald Trump went on Sean Hannity and spoke with Sean about rigged elections.
[00:05:29.475 --> 00:05:35.919]  Vladimir Putin came out a few days later and spoke about how American elections have been rigged in the past.
[00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:38.100]  Here's a recap of those events.
[00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:41.783]  Mr. Trump, I'm not going to lay things out here that you don't already know.
[00:05:42.723 --> 00:05:55.633]  But I am going to ask you to seriously think about making the issue of Hillary's election fraud in the primaries one of the central issues to defeating her in November.
[00:05:55.993 --> 00:06:00.016]  And I'm telling you, November 8th, we better be careful because that election's gonna be rigged.
[00:06:00.156 --> 00:06:00.917]  First of all, it's rigged.
[00:06:01.477 --> 00:06:03.998]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[00:06:04.678 --> 00:06:08.459]  And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's gonna be taken away from us.
[00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.181]  America teaches everybody how to live in, quote, democracy.
[00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:13.061]  But what?
[00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:16.422]  You actually believe that they have democratic elections there?
[00:06:16.782 --> 00:06:25.005]  If Hillary steals the nomination, and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump, you have to say it must be thrown out.
[00:06:25.505 --> 00:06:34.217]  Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her from the very beginning by this Democratic Party.
[00:06:34.317 --> 00:06:35.258]  It has been rigged.
[00:06:35.298 --> 00:06:38.102]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[00:06:39.063 --> 00:06:40.545]  Contrary to popular belief.
[00:06:40.926 --> 00:06:42.448]  Then why are they holding the primaries?
[00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:44.637]  That's a very good question.
[00:06:44.797 --> 00:06:59.030]  It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly prefers Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously, and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and marginally to facilitate that outcome, they are being done.
[00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.115]  When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[00:07:04.175 --> 00:07:05.176]  Actually, I think that's part of it.
[00:07:05.416 --> 00:07:09.123]  And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud.
[00:07:09.423 --> 00:07:10.305]  And guess what there is?
[00:07:10.565 --> 00:07:12.449]  She stole the nomination!
[00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:14.893]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[00:07:14.953 --> 00:07:15.434]  What does that mean?
[00:07:16.434 --> 00:07:18.276]  How would the party pick a new nominee?
[00:07:18.496 --> 00:07:19.417]  Today is the day!
[00:07:19.477 --> 00:07:23.020]  They're really thinking about maybe getting him off the top of the ticket.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.942]  He now looks increasingly like the Kamikaze candidate.
[00:07:26.523 --> 00:07:29.405]  An implosion, the likes of which I have never seen.
[00:07:29.425 --> 00:07:32.588]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:43.958]  If Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country,
[00:07:45.723 --> 00:07:48.045]  Including in places like Texas.
[00:07:50.306 --> 00:07:50.926]  That's ridiculous.
[00:07:51.026 --> 00:07:52.027]  That doesn't make any sense.
[00:07:52.107 --> 00:07:53.988]  And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.
[00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:58.031]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars is now controlling the narrative.
[00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:04.035]  Go to InfoWars.com for more information and InfoWarsStore.com to support the fight for truth.
[00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:17.094]  Americanism, not globalism will be our credo!
[00:08:19.756 --> 00:08:21.938]  Americanism, not globalism!
[00:08:25.166 --> 00:08:29.207]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
[00:08:29.527 --> 00:08:35.629]  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[00:08:35.989 --> 00:08:43.511]  They have gotten the political establishment and the media establishment to become pure, wanton henchmen of totalitarianism.
[00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:48.633]  If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better.
[00:08:49.133 --> 00:08:52.275]  I think what the Chinese have done is really smart.
[00:09:04.642 --> 00:09:06.363]  Right here in Detroit.
[00:09:06.924 --> 00:09:08.705]  It's all training us to accept less.
[00:09:09.005 --> 00:09:10.146]  Lowering expectations.
[00:09:10.386 --> 00:09:11.507]  A post-industrial world.
[00:09:11.747 --> 00:09:12.548]  A new dark age.
[00:09:12.708 --> 00:09:16.531]  That's what the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 calls for.
[00:09:16.791 --> 00:09:20.214]  When we abandon the policy of America first,
[00:09:21.034 --> 00:09:25.058]  We started rebuilding other countries instead of our own.
[00:09:25.439 --> 00:09:29.543]  Not a world, Winston, that gets more beautiful and more technological and stronger.
[00:09:29.563 --> 00:09:32.626]  A world that gets uglier and stupider and more stunted.
[00:09:32.766 --> 00:09:39.472]  The government should allow Hillary Clinton to become President of the United States.
[00:09:39.993 --> 00:09:41.694]  I voted for Hillary Clinton.
[00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:43.056]  Well, I voted for Hillary.
[00:09:43.076 --> 00:09:45.318]  I guess I have to since I'm working for her as well.
[00:09:45.618 --> 00:09:47.558]  You want an image of the future, Winston?
[00:09:47.758 --> 00:09:49.919]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[00:09:49.999 --> 00:09:56.460]  Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.101]  Women are treated, discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[00:10:01.442 --> 00:10:04.922]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[00:10:04.982 --> 00:10:05.863]  They're mistreated.
[00:10:06.543 --> 00:10:07.863]  She claims to be their champion.
[00:10:08.323 --> 00:10:16.911]  Don't look at me, Weston, and see the black circles around my eyes, and see how ugly and weak I am, expressing myself and dying, and I torture people 18 hours a day, and I have a horrible life!
[00:10:17.151 --> 00:10:21.495]  That's the beauty of the satanic evil of the priest of power ripping apart humanity!
[00:10:21.615 --> 00:10:22.757]  We're here to hurt humans!
[00:10:22.897 --> 00:10:24.518]  We're here to suck your guts out!
[00:10:25.579 --> 00:10:31.625]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, and the heart of the resistance.
[00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:36.809]  A lot of extreme things are happening in America.
[00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:52.424]  George Soros, the Rothschilds, the big Ford Foundation combines are openly fomenting racial division and division between men and women and every form of divide and conquer balkanization.
[00:10:53.805 --> 00:10:54.766]  We have the
[00:10:56.394 --> 00:11:09.362]  Pump being primed for civil unrest across the country, a second night of violence in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with Trump set to speak outside Milwaukee tomorrow.
[00:11:13.585 --> 00:11:22.891]  We have major Western governments run by the same foundations that I just mentioned openly
[00:11:24.264 --> 00:11:32.628]  Financing media operations against those that warn of the invasion of radical Islam.
[00:11:34.228 --> 00:11:35.769]  We're going to be breaking that down today.
[00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:53.397]  And then they tell us, as they try to undermine society and civilization, to consolidate control, as George Soros goes around the world, in more than 30 countries, he's helped crash
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:14.496]  In the last 50 years, they lecture us that we're extremist because we use rhetoric like, well, if the courts ban all the guns, the Declaration of Independence says we have a right and a duty to defend ourselves against this.
[00:12:17.758 --> 00:12:18.779]  They call that extreme.
[00:12:18.819 --> 00:12:20.741]  The truth is, promoting
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:38.776]  Grassroots movements to randomly go out and shoot police officers, firefighters, and random citizens is the essence of what I would term 21st century Red Terror.
[00:12:43.899 --> 00:12:46.260]  We're going to be getting to the situation in Milwaukee.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.824]  We're going to be sending Jakari Jackson and Rob Dew and others up there as we speak today.
[00:12:51.844 --> 00:12:52.744]  They're getting ready to go now.
[00:12:52.764 --> 00:12:58.267]  And they're also going to be covering the Trump rally coming up tomorrow night as well.
[00:12:59.188 --> 00:13:01.949]  So we'll have live feeds of all of that for you, obviously.
[00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.712]  We've got the nightly news coming up tonight, seven o'clock central time.
[00:13:07.312 --> 00:13:11.335]  We're going to be going over the latest clips that are simply amazing.
[00:13:12.739 --> 00:13:22.645]  There's one lady on tape saying, hey idiots, don't burn down our neighborhoods, go burn down the suburbs.
[00:13:23.966 --> 00:13:26.067]  And I've got to actually say, she's got a point.
[00:13:28.148 --> 00:13:36.773]  If some cop you think wrongly killed a member of your family, wouldn't you go after that individual?
[00:13:36.793 --> 00:13:40.296]  And I'm not even advocating that, I'm just saying hypothetically.
[00:13:40.896 --> 00:13:42.017]  Why would you randomly
[00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:49.960]  As I've said many times, if a cop does something wrong in Louisiana, you think, you go kill five cops in Dallas.
[00:13:51.201 --> 00:13:57.405]  Or cops do something bad in Chicago, so you go kill cops in Oakland.
[00:13:59.346 --> 00:14:00.988]  And how the media always makes it racial.
[00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:02.088]  I mean, this is a black cop.
[00:14:02.108 --> 00:14:04.150]  The guy reportedly is running around waving a gun.
[00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.671]  He shoots him.
[00:14:05.691 --> 00:14:07.112]  It's in the middle of the night.
[00:14:08.271 --> 00:14:12.575]  And then it turns into all these riots with white people being drug out of their cars and beaten.
[00:14:14.617 --> 00:14:18.561]  And then just a few days ago, I didn't even play this clip, because I'm not trying to demonize Black Lives Matter.
[00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:19.642]  They do it for themselves.
[00:14:19.822 --> 00:14:21.163]  Totally Soros run on record.
[00:14:22.725 --> 00:14:28.871]  They're blocking a road, and there's a black lady in a car, and she accidentally bumped somebody, so they start shooting at her in the car.
[00:14:31.213 --> 00:14:32.354]  It's just crazy!
[00:14:38.612 --> 00:14:42.854]  But I mean, I don't want to just sit here and make fun of all this, because it is really stupid.
[00:14:43.334 --> 00:14:47.676]  Because it's so serious at the end of the day, but it does have a humor element to it.
[00:14:47.696 --> 00:15:02.782]  In fact, let me get to the Trump news first, and then I'm going to get into all of the latest developments around the country with the Justice Department caught inside these groups using psychological warfare techniques to hype up all these young people.
[00:15:03.757 --> 00:15:25.255]  And the MTV gangster culture in the 90s that was on record to weaponize these communities, the hip-hop culture weaponized by MTV has been exported worldwide and mutates the culture of anybody it hits, whether it's Russians or Appalachian whites or Chinese school kids, the Chinese abandoned.
[00:15:27.516 --> 00:15:28.958]  And the communists won't let it in their country.
[00:15:30.839 --> 00:15:31.520]  And it's just
[00:15:33.007 --> 00:15:39.493]  All a culture about being a thug, never amounting to anything, all or nothing.
[00:15:42.035 --> 00:15:45.157]  You can really see what the globalists are doing with their weaponized media.
[00:15:46.058 --> 00:15:49.441]  And just remember that when you're watching something like the Olympics.
[00:15:50.102 --> 00:15:57.908]  I was watching the Olympics a few nights ago during Phelps' final race.
[00:15:57.928 --> 00:15:59.089]  I mean, how couldn't you?
[00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:01.191]  It is interesting.
[00:16:04.574 --> 00:16:16.418]  And, there was a Boeing ad during it, that we've looked, a bunch of us online, if somebody's got a DVR, please put it on YouTube or send it to us, where it says, Boeing.
[00:16:16.998 --> 00:16:19.759]  A mechanical company, or a technology company?
[00:16:19.799 --> 00:16:20.239]  We're both.
[00:16:20.599 --> 00:16:28.301]  And the family's coming to visit Boeing, and they go in, and it's the mother, the father, and what looks like about their 16 year old son.
[00:16:28.862 --> 00:16:30.082]  He doesn't look quite right though.
[00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.572]  And then they go to her and she's an engineer working on the plane.
[00:16:34.913 --> 00:16:39.476]  She's got a wrench in her hand, you know, got a classic male job.
[00:16:41.898 --> 00:16:44.761]  And they say, so you're engineering, but you're also technology.
[00:16:44.781 --> 00:16:46.202]  She's like, yes, it all meshes together.
[00:16:47.788 --> 00:17:02.634]  And so the son keeps repeating things and saying things and comparing things to that, like fish and water and things like that, and starts making a bunch of stupid statements, and the family's trying to get him to shut up, and then the dad finally tells him, look, shut up.
[00:17:02.654 --> 00:17:08.916]  And everybody has a laugh, and then you realize it was totally near subliminal, but wasn't.
[00:17:09.876 --> 00:17:10.777]  He was autistic.
[00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:12.971]  And it's like, it's okay.
[00:17:13.272 --> 00:17:15.735]  Almost all your sons soon will be autistic.
[00:17:16.015 --> 00:17:18.297]  Your daughter can be the man in the future.
[00:17:18.598 --> 00:17:19.819]  And it was so subliminal.
[00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:24.845]  I mean, it was right there if you're conscious and watching it, but it didn't even click for me to the end.
[00:17:24.885 --> 00:17:26.226]  I was like, what's going on with this?
[00:17:26.707 --> 00:17:29.450]  And they were celebrating the brain damaged son.
[00:17:31.323 --> 00:17:32.283]  In our face.
[00:17:32.904 --> 00:17:47.448]  And by the way, I told you a year before they admitted it that that Green Police ad for Audi's on the Super Bowl five, six years ago was guaranteed finance by government because it was the Green Police uniforms, it was the real Green Police operations they're starting in Australia and other areas.
[00:17:48.048 --> 00:17:48.749]  It was all real.
[00:17:49.349 --> 00:17:50.229]  It just wasn't here yet.
[00:17:50.509 --> 00:17:58.932]  Arresting people for their hot tub being too hot, or their house being too cold, or having the wrong batteries, or the wrong emissions test, a checkpoint.
[00:18:00.791 --> 00:18:13.079]  And then the mayor of San Francisco came out in the San Francisco Chronicle and bragged that they got international funding and government funding and that that was to condition the public and shot his mouth off in the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:18.983]  Understand, folks, I guarantee you that that was probably
[00:18:20.202 --> 00:18:31.751]  Department of Education funded because they want to see what they do is when you start getting 3,000 percent increases in breast cancer in women in every industrialized nation and then countries that don't have glyphosate just don't have it basically.
[00:18:31.771 --> 00:18:35.554]  I'm going to skip the breakfast, it's too important.
[00:18:35.694 --> 00:18:46.122]  What they do is they have to normalize it and make it interesting like getting breast cancers like part of the club kind of like gay men that since the 80s want to get HIV because they're part of the club called bug chasers.
[00:18:46.323 --> 00:18:46.683]  It's a fact.
[00:18:48.035 --> 00:18:52.097]  And so subliminally, but also then ratcheted up, you never want to find a cure.
[00:18:52.117 --> 00:18:59.580]  You're always claiming you want to find the cure, but you never want to find the real cure that is what's causing it to skyrocket.
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.801]  You just want to find, quote, treatments for it and call them cures.
[00:19:03.682 --> 00:19:06.403]  But never find out why it's skyrocketing, even though it's been known.
[00:19:07.363 --> 00:19:13.286]  That glyphosate grows breast tumors and grows prostate tumors.
[00:19:13.466 --> 00:19:14.446]  Just absolute fact.
[00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:15.827]  They knew before they approved it.
[00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:25.249]  No, that's not the end.
[00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.413]  I spent like hours trying to find this weekend, but again, it's all part of the same thing.
[00:19:30.433 --> 00:19:33.255]  It's always a woman that's the engineer in every Star Wars.
[00:19:34.415 --> 00:19:40.299]  The woman's the top general, and the woman's the top hero, and the woman's this, and the woman's the top villain, and the woman, the woman, the woman, the woman.
[00:19:40.319 --> 00:19:46.903]  And again, I'm not against women being shown in roles like that, except that it's force-fed, and it's done for a reason.
[00:19:46.943 --> 00:19:49.305]  But I'm going to get to that in a moment.
[00:19:51.243 --> 00:19:55.824]  Get into Trump, but people have to understand the bombardment is everywhere.
[00:19:55.884 --> 00:19:57.784]  It doesn't matter if it's CBS or NBC.
[00:19:57.804 --> 00:19:59.365]  It doesn't matter if it's entertainment or news.
[00:19:59.385 --> 00:20:02.165]  It doesn't matter what Fortune 100 corporation it is.
[00:20:02.265 --> 00:20:03.505]  It's all unified.
[00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:11.147]  And they meet in big boardrooms, which they don't even hide, and decide, how are we going to condition the public to accept implantable microchips?
[00:20:11.927 --> 00:20:15.768]  This was in 1999, and Wash Tech, a magazine of the Washington Post,
[00:20:16.628 --> 00:20:26.812]  Actually had one of these tech developers there saying, well, we just met in Chicago last month and we're going to push in the media body modification to get everyone ready for chips.
[00:20:27.292 --> 00:20:30.033]  Now, I'm not against body modification if you want to do that yourself.
[00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:37.316]  The point is, all the studs and the earrings and all these things were suddenly pushed by the media.
[00:20:37.757 --> 00:20:40.178]  They weren't popular 16, 17 years ago like they are now.
[00:20:40.578 --> 00:20:43.259]  And it was all pushed to just get you ready.
[00:20:44.219 --> 00:20:45.820]  And they said they were going to do it.
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:46.740]  It's not my opinion.
[00:20:49.482 --> 00:20:59.827]  So, that's what I'm getting at here is that the breast cancer example, they have a run for breast cancer, or buy a pink vodka for breast cancer, or...
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:08.645]  Raise awareness or have a license plate and feel bad about it and, you know, be part of the community and then just get normalized to it.
[00:21:09.026 --> 00:21:09.826]  That it's normal.
[00:21:10.326 --> 00:21:17.472]  And then they have images there of where it makes it fun that the son is autistic.
[00:21:19.373 --> 00:21:22.715]  And he gets slapped down and dad tells him, shut up, but it's okay.
[00:21:23.016 --> 00:21:24.096]  We've got a daughter.
[00:21:25.337 --> 00:21:26.058]  Isn't that sweet?
[00:21:26.478 --> 00:21:27.399]  We've got a daughter.
[00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:33.666]  Men are stunted, men are retarded, men have autism because they're targeted.
[00:21:36.268 --> 00:21:38.350]  Men can't produce, men can't provide.
[00:21:38.951 --> 00:21:52.923]  For 50 years, started in about the 60s, they started making dads quirky, dads weird, no longer in charge, strong types, which then men would look at and try to act like.
[00:21:54.056 --> 00:21:56.319]  Which is what biologically humans are supposed to operate like.
[00:21:56.539 --> 00:21:58.481]  It's what women are looking for, no matter what they tell you.
[00:21:58.702 --> 00:22:02.827]  Every scale shows women are more unhappy than they've ever been since the mid-1950s.
[00:22:02.867 --> 00:22:03.708]  Going straight down!
[00:22:07.205 --> 00:22:18.754]  And they incrementally now, every major father figure is a mindless idiot, total buffoon, who can't do anything right and is lazy and stupid and cheating and sitting on the couch farting.
[00:22:19.254 --> 00:22:23.597]  Unless they're a liberal guru, a priest type person.
[00:22:24.298 --> 00:22:37.421]  I don't mean a literal priest, but a priest type who is guruing everyone to be more liberal and henpecking folks to follow globalism, socialism, and he's a gay pastor that marries gay men or whatever.
[00:22:38.061 --> 00:22:43.943]  Then it's okay to have a man in a leadership role, but only when they're superhero liberal.
[00:22:44.943 --> 00:22:47.684]  And then Hollywood admits this is their agenda.
[00:22:47.724 --> 00:22:49.004]  They're not even hiding it!
[00:22:49.844 --> 00:22:52.869]  And then I have to have debates with people about Gamergate.
[00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:53.591]  Did it exist?
[00:22:53.791 --> 00:22:54.753]  They admit it existed!
[00:22:56.696 --> 00:23:00.744]  And the point is, they're taking down human civilization.
[00:23:03.513 --> 00:23:06.016]  They're ending humans as we know it.
[00:23:06.156 --> 00:23:07.438]  We are obsolete.
[00:23:07.558 --> 00:23:08.859]  The globalists have stated it.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:21.774]  So first they have to just get us totally atomized, broken up, where nobody even knows what's going on, where everyone's totally confused, where women are marching around thinking they're supposed to be the bosses all the time because they're a woman.
[00:23:23.845 --> 00:23:26.027]  60%!
[00:23:24.606 --> 00:23:26.027]  In England it's 65%.
[00:23:26.107 --> 00:23:38.078]  They're pushing and admitting they want 80% women college graduates because men are bad and need to be made to be a subservient class, implying that's what women always were.
[00:23:38.957 --> 00:23:42.139]  Again, it's not like some women we love you, we're putting you in charge.
[00:23:42.439 --> 00:23:55.805]  This is horrible, wicked, evil, ancient, twisted men running a long-term program laughing at everyone while they hit women with hardcore chemical weapons and GMO trash.
[00:23:58.666 --> 00:24:06.450]  And then they know that women want to shelter and love their sons and daughters, but then they have to create kind of a sick, subliminal joke
[00:24:07.878 --> 00:24:10.160]  That it's okay, it's kind of fun to celebrate it.
[00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:16.865]  By the way, there's a lady I'm gonna do a report on who's won six gold medals, I think more than anybody ever, they're saying, for shooting.
[00:24:18.466 --> 00:24:20.407]  You see almost no coverage about her.
[00:24:20.908 --> 00:24:22.168]  No one even really knows her name.
[00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:25.311]  Because she's a woman.
[00:24:26.392 --> 00:24:30.735]  You only show the fantasy Rogue One leading everyone.
[00:24:32.045 --> 00:24:46.510]  Because there's all the other messages in it to prime women to think they don't need men in their lives, and to prime women in the final phase to be in the military, but only to operate the switches and the systems of the technocracy.
[00:24:48.051 --> 00:24:50.151]  This is the phasing out of humans.
[00:24:52.472 --> 00:24:54.613]  And they're phasing out the atomic family.
[00:24:59.158 --> 00:25:14.847]  Black Americans under oppression in many areas of the country were developing more wealth than the blue-collar and even middle-class white areas, and that started creating real racism and real jealousy.
[00:25:16.208 --> 00:25:20.210]  I'm not defending the segregation that was there, but the point was, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
[00:25:20.391 --> 00:25:21.391]  The statistics don't lie.
[00:25:21.791 --> 00:25:26.034]  Lower illegitimacy rate than in the white community.
[00:25:28.757 --> 00:25:38.424]  Within one decade of the Democrats putting in their great society, the numbers surpassed whites.
[00:25:38.624 --> 00:25:41.806]  And then, depending on where you are in the country, 75% is about the average.
[00:25:41.826 --> 00:25:45.088]  Some areas, upwards of 90% no men in the households.
[00:25:46.049 --> 00:25:47.990]  How'd it work out not having men around?
[00:25:49.791 --> 00:25:55.395]  Then you give the men an arrested development gangster thug culture to say, this is how you're a man.
[00:25:55.635 --> 00:25:56.536]  You didn't have a daddy?
[00:25:56.756 --> 00:25:57.897]  The gang leader's your daddy.
[00:25:59.872 --> 00:26:00.853]  Basic psychology.
[00:26:01.734 --> 00:26:03.036]  The globalists know how to lead people.
[00:26:03.556 --> 00:26:04.698]  They know how to lead you right into hell.
[00:26:05.018 --> 00:26:12.567]  And everything you've seen done in the black community is now being duplicated in every quote community even though the communities are all integrated basically.
[00:26:14.609 --> 00:26:15.030]  And men
[00:26:16.465 --> 00:26:22.508]  That are in the upper crust, no matter what color they are, just kind of hide in their corporate job and go play golf and kiss other men's butts that are above them.
[00:26:22.929 --> 00:26:27.291]  And then follow their orders to bring in women to be the new servant class.
[00:26:27.371 --> 00:26:28.852]  Okay, sir.
[00:26:28.872 --> 00:26:32.934]  Just like IBM engineers would bring in Indian engineers who'd be paid a third to replace them.
[00:26:34.015 --> 00:26:36.736]  But the truth is, it's not creating women as some new superclass.
[00:26:36.816 --> 00:26:38.997]  It's getting rid of the entire structure.
[00:26:39.838 --> 00:26:41.779]  Like taking doors off of a submarine.
[00:26:44.744 --> 00:26:54.688]  How did it do for Mexican culture driving more than 30 million farmers in the last 40 years off of their lands with taxes and regulations in Mexico?
[00:26:55.748 --> 00:26:57.409]  How'd that work out for Mexico?
[00:26:57.429 --> 00:27:00.430]  It's got the most hellish city on earth, Mexico City.
[00:27:02.591 --> 00:27:04.552]  The civilization has completely collapsed.
[00:27:08.273 --> 00:27:13.455]  And then what's left of the farmers have to run here to try to engage in what they were engaging in a few generations ago.
[00:27:16.513 --> 00:27:19.434]  This is the scientific takedown of humanity, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:20.375 --> 00:27:31.400]  And I can sit here and talk about Donald Trump, and talk about what's happening up in Milwaukee, and laugh at the just flaming, racist, trashy, dumbed-down people.
[00:27:35.442 --> 00:27:39.143]  Except, I can barely keep the world from getting control of my kids.
[00:27:40.764 --> 00:27:41.184]  Myself.
[00:27:41.444 --> 00:27:42.525]  I mean, this is so scientific.
[00:27:42.565 --> 00:27:43.125]  I don't know.
[00:27:43.145 --> 00:27:44.466]  I mean, I sit there and laugh at people.
[00:27:45.455 --> 00:27:48.876]  That have been absolutely, psychologically destroyed?
[00:27:48.896 --> 00:27:50.957]  I don't take any pleasure in it.
[00:27:54.918 --> 00:27:56.559]  God, look what they've done to humanity.
[00:27:56.659 --> 00:27:59.259]  It's just... And we already have our own problems.
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:03.621]  But they just grease the skids for every form of evil, every form of corruption.
[00:28:03.641 --> 00:28:06.982]  They just open the door up and they make sure all the machinery is real nice.
[00:28:07.562 --> 00:28:13.204]  And then they have George Soros and Obama and Hillary lead black people into their new national movement
[00:28:15.017 --> 00:28:24.640]  And they noticed the Justice Department always picked where there were seven or ten black witnesses that the guy was charging the police and attacking, or the guy had a gun, or the guy was on top of somebody beating him.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:33.803]  They always choose the cases that are the worst to make you look like idiots in their whole class of civilizations.
[00:28:34.563 --> 00:28:36.424]  And I have to sit here and watch all this unfold.
[00:28:36.484 --> 00:28:37.424]  It makes me sick.
[00:28:37.704 --> 00:28:44.106]  You know, I've learned so much about how stuff works that soon as I heard Trump come out and start saying that
[00:28:46.943 --> 00:28:53.206]  He's setting up a national movement to have integrity in elections and have poll watchers.
[00:28:55.207 --> 00:29:00.429]  I knew that was coming from him, and I knew some of his other advisors didn't like it, because I know the inside of baseball.
[00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:05.111]  And for two days, you can't find it on the website.
[00:29:05.131 --> 00:29:06.371]  You have to dig to find it.
[00:29:07.272 --> 00:29:09.253]  We're going to send out an email later today so you can find it.
[00:29:11.534 --> 00:29:12.474]  We have the URL right here.
[00:29:15.777 --> 00:29:17.459]  And I knew when I went there, there'd be sabotage.
[00:29:17.879 --> 00:29:19.201]  And that's just how my brain works at this point.
[00:29:19.541 --> 00:29:26.889]  I am so immersed in all of this that I understand there's basically two campaigns in the Trump situation.
[00:29:29.592 --> 00:29:31.394]  Volunteer to be a Trump election observer.
[00:29:31.434 --> 00:29:33.076]  I'm going to do a piece on it when we come back from break, guys.
[00:29:34.309 --> 00:29:37.772]  And I'm going to take a snippet out of the show and send it out to everybody that's part of the InfoWars Insider.
[00:29:38.112 --> 00:29:41.235]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletters.
[00:29:41.275 --> 00:29:43.817]  Put in your email there and we're going to do a piece on this coming up.
[00:29:43.857 --> 00:29:49.802]  We're going to clip that out, send it out with a URL that was hard for us to even find on the Trump site.
[00:29:50.123 --> 00:29:52.805]  He's out giving speeches everywhere, but magically that's not up there.
[00:29:53.225 --> 00:29:56.388]  Well, we're going to make sure that Trump's wishes get pushed out there as we agree with him.
[00:29:56.809 --> 00:29:57.269]  Stay with us.
[00:29:57.329 --> 00:29:58.170]  Big news straight ahead.
[00:30:00.276 --> 00:30:03.281]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.202 --> 00:30:06.886]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.112 --> 00:30:12.453]  Article by Business Insider.
[00:30:12.593 --> 00:30:15.154]  Americans are getting concerned about rising home prices.
[00:30:15.375 --> 00:30:17.576]  The gap between supply and demand is widening.
[00:30:17.756 --> 00:30:22.399]  It's being dubbed the new housing crisis, and the gap is taking median house prices through the roof.
[00:30:22.639 --> 00:30:27.822]  San Jose is the first city to have an MHP of $1 million for a one-family house last quarter.
[00:30:27.962 --> 00:30:34.486]  Low interest rates are creating higher demand to buy homes, according to the Consumer Sentiment Survey from the University of Michigan, which also states,
[00:30:35.006 --> 00:30:41.488]  Home buying has become particularly dependent on low interest rates, with net references to low interest rates spontaneously mentioned by 48%.
[00:30:41.948 --> 00:30:45.830]  This figure has been exceeded in only two months in the past 10 years.
[00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:52.152]  In English, low rates may rise soon if the Fed changes its tune, so buyers want to take advantage of the rates now.
[00:30:52.432 --> 00:30:54.093]  Rates are low, but not housing prices.
[00:30:54.293 --> 00:31:00.095]  Quote, low housing prices were cited by just 25%, according to the survey's release, the lowest figure in 10 years.
[00:31:00.675 --> 00:31:03.058]  This is starting to create a dissonance of sorts in Americans.
[00:31:03.218 --> 00:31:07.703]  Little do many of them know, a bubble is set to burst and what's to come is yet the worst.
[00:31:07.923 --> 00:31:10.546]  This is Gabe Goldiamond for InfoWars.com.
[00:31:11.086 --> 00:31:21.257]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[00:31:21.457 --> 00:31:28.381]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:31:28.561 --> 00:31:33.264]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:31:33.444 --> 00:31:40.128]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:40.228 --> 00:31:47.312]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:31:47.392 --> 00:31:49.192]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[00:31:49.292 --> 00:31:54.274]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:31:54.414 --> 00:31:58.775]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:31:58.895 --> 00:32:02.156]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:32:02.296 --> 00:32:08.417]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:32:08.597 --> 00:32:10.258]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:32:11.378 --> 00:32:12.779]  Article from Daily Mail.
[00:32:12.859 --> 00:32:14.640]  Too much TV lowers sperm count.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.742]  Watching more than five hours a day of what I like to call the Satan Box lowers sperm count by 33%.
[00:32:20.643 --> 00:32:27.046]  Copenhagen University did a study with 1,200 healthy young men to see if the lazy lifestyle affected fertility.
[00:32:27.226 --> 00:32:33.469]  Binge watchers had 37 million per milliliter sperm count, while non-watchers had 52 million per milliliter sperm count.
[00:32:33.689 --> 00:32:40.915]  These Netflix and chillers without the chill also had lower levels of testosterone, which the body absolutely needs to produce sperm.
[00:32:41.215 --> 00:32:44.879]  Sitting at a computer, the study found, however, did not have the same effect.
[00:32:45.059 --> 00:32:53.526]  This article makes the point that those who binge watch may be neglecting their health through lack of exercise and healthy eating, both crucial for maximum fertility.
[00:32:53.746 --> 00:32:58.450]  Other studies have found other possible causes for decreasing male fertility over the past few decades.
[00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:02.093]  Junk food, poison drinking water, and BPA are among them.
[00:33:02.493 --> 00:33:04.875]  This is Gabe Goldiamond for InfoWars.com.
[00:33:05.156 --> 00:33:06.677]  More amazing reports to come!
[00:33:11.286 --> 00:33:12.347]  Oh, you've got it.
[00:33:12.568 --> 00:33:18.275]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:33:18.355 --> 00:33:20.477]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:28.407]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:34.394 --> 00:33:35.574]  All right, we are live.
[00:33:35.894 --> 00:33:37.855]  We are 33 minutes of this worldwide broadcast.
[00:33:37.875 --> 00:33:40.716]  We've got about three hours and 27 minutes left.
[00:33:41.336 --> 00:33:44.236]  We have a lot of big guests joining us.
[00:33:44.336 --> 00:33:49.158]  Former high-level Secret Service agent Dan Bongino is going to be coming on the show.
[00:33:50.118 --> 00:33:59.080]  We were already setting him up last week after he tore Don Lemon to pieces dealing with his attack on Donald Trump and the Second Amendment.
[00:34:00.478 --> 00:34:07.484]  He's not coming on today, and he's not the source of our Secret Service information concerning Hillary having all these health problems.
[00:34:07.884 --> 00:34:08.144]  Okay?
[00:34:09.405 --> 00:34:11.307]  He's coming on to talk about other issues.
[00:34:11.747 --> 00:34:18.953]  Every time we say we have some big Secret Service news, he gets a bunch of threatening phone calls, even though it's on record that he's not our source on these things.
[00:34:19.293 --> 00:34:24.597]  He has said that what we cover dealing with Hillary
[00:34:26.769 --> 00:34:28.010]  Well, he just leaves it at this.
[00:34:28.451 --> 00:34:29.712]  It's worse than we say.
[00:34:30.413 --> 00:34:34.698]  That's what other former Secret Service agents have said who've been on air with us as well.
[00:34:37.081 --> 00:34:41.506]  We ran into Secret Service, obviously, in Cleveland.
[00:34:42.657 --> 00:34:45.879]  They said in a few weeks, through an individual, we will give you some information.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.061]  And it was basically just confirming what we already know.
[00:34:49.141 --> 00:34:50.882]  She was in a hospital for almost a year.
[00:34:51.543 --> 00:34:53.244]  She had a bunch of brain surgeries, folks.
[00:34:53.584 --> 00:34:55.025]  They've kept her medical records secret.
[00:34:55.045 --> 00:34:55.966]  She looks like hell.
[00:34:56.326 --> 00:34:59.928]  She's clearly having these little petite mole seizures.
[00:35:01.089 --> 00:35:03.111]  She is having to be helped upstairs.
[00:35:04.296 --> 00:35:11.598]  And we were told they've had to retrofit the vehicles basically with the handicap systems that lower to the ground and then it rises back up because you can't go up steps.
[00:35:12.838 --> 00:35:15.919]  And that they think a big announcement's coming soon.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.260]  Then we got other information.
[00:35:21.561 --> 00:35:27.522]  I mean, I have sources that guarded Hillary Clinton for years when she was in the State Department.
[00:35:27.842 --> 00:35:30.043]  I have sources that guarded her sometimes for just three days.
[00:35:31.664 --> 00:35:33.184]  And these are serious, real people.
[00:35:34.775 --> 00:35:35.935]  Because I'm trusted.
[00:35:36.236 --> 00:35:37.376]  I'm told this information.
[00:35:37.816 --> 00:35:38.716]  How she treats people.
[00:35:39.116 --> 00:35:39.817]  What she does.
[00:35:40.437 --> 00:35:41.257]  How she behaves.
[00:35:42.558 --> 00:35:43.758]  And she's definitely a weirdo.
[00:35:46.359 --> 00:35:48.860]  And some of it is so crazy, I don't even want to say it on air.
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.340]  It just sounds unbelievable.
[00:35:54.342 --> 00:35:59.624]  And some of these people are folks that, you know, could show you photos of them with Hillary.
[00:36:02.324 --> 00:36:03.685]  And we got information today
[00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:20.880]  Through Biggs, one of his contacts, that's confirmed that Biggs knows well that they were bringing somebody to meet with Hillary just recently, and man, they were talking about staging an assassination attempt on Hillary.
[00:36:23.782 --> 00:36:25.283]  Notice this stuff's all too hot to handle.
[00:36:25.303 --> 00:36:28.025]  They don't show up here and try to arrest us for leaking stuff.
[00:36:28.245 --> 00:36:30.027]  They don't do that because they know it's too dangerous.
[00:36:31.408 --> 00:36:32.368]  They don't want this coming out.
[00:36:32.388 --> 00:36:33.369]  They don't want this getting attention.
[00:36:35.285 --> 00:36:36.866]  Where's the mainstream media attacking me?
[00:36:36.946 --> 00:36:40.088]  I mean, I'm saying I've made up a leak from the Secret Service.
[00:36:40.128 --> 00:36:40.708]  Where is it?
[00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:44.591]  Because they know good and well it's not made up over at MSNBC.
[00:36:44.651 --> 00:36:52.155]  All right, I want to compose myself.
[00:36:53.516 --> 00:36:58.019]  And by compose myself, I need to laser beam focus and get through a bunch of this news because there's so much of it that's so important.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.042]  Before I do that, let me just get to the point I was making earlier.
[00:37:04.676 --> 00:37:18.104]  We need to help Donald Trump sign up American citizens to be poll watchers across the United States, but especially in the battleground states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, and others.
[00:37:18.644 --> 00:37:30.891]  Trump's internal polling shows, and this is real polling they're doing with top scientific poll groups to really try to see where they're at, is that Trump is ahead in all these battleground states 5 to 10 to 12 points.
[00:37:30.951 --> 00:37:32.112]  Florida, it's like 12 points.
[00:37:33.001 --> 00:37:35.782]  They do poll after poll showing 10, 12, 13 points.
[00:37:36.702 --> 00:37:38.082]  He's dead heat in California.
[00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:39.883]  They say she's like 15 points ahead there.
[00:37:40.603 --> 00:37:44.764]  He's ahead 5, 6 points, 7 points depending on the poll in New York.
[00:37:45.705 --> 00:37:46.345]  This is big.
[00:37:46.585 --> 00:37:50.006]  He goes to Democrat areas and the 20,000 people show up.
[00:37:50.366 --> 00:37:51.626]  Most of them registered Democrats.
[00:37:52.026 --> 00:37:57.288]  He got more people to vote for him in the primaries than in all Republican history and that was running against 12, 13 other people.
[00:37:59.551 --> 00:38:00.171]  This is big.
[00:38:01.092 --> 00:38:03.593]  And Trump knows the only way they're going to win is fraud.
[00:38:04.634 --> 00:38:12.159]  And I have advised, I'll just leave it at that, the strategy that you see taking place right now, which is just a common sense strategy.
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.702]  Now I know there are some people on the campaign that think this is a waste of time.
[00:38:18.342 --> 00:38:23.565]  Was it a waste of time when he challenged that they were stealing primaries from Sanders and he?
[00:38:23.906 --> 00:38:25.707]  They had to give them back to Trump because he contested it.
[00:38:26.673 --> 00:38:27.934]  Sanders didn't contest it.
[00:38:28.154 --> 00:38:31.176]  It's like they call a bad play, and you go, hey, I want instant replay.
[00:38:31.797 --> 00:38:33.378]  Remember the old days you had to ask for instant replay?
[00:38:34.819 --> 00:38:35.479]  That's what we're saying.
[00:38:35.519 --> 00:38:37.040]  We're going to have instant replay on this.
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.402]  There are going to be a lot of eyeballs on it.
[00:38:40.223 --> 00:38:48.849]  Now, for two days since he called for a nationwide movement for people to get organized, and it was all over the news, I have been looking
[00:38:50.043 --> 00:38:53.065]  On the website, and it took me over a day to find it.
[00:38:53.525 --> 00:38:57.188]  Nowhere on the front page can you find it at DonaldJTrump.com.
[00:38:58.609 --> 00:39:03.612]  So, we finally found out how to do it, and we shot a video of us searching on the web to show you how to do it.
[00:39:03.632 --> 00:39:10.496]  You go to DonaldJTrump.com, and then after that, you put in a URL, LP.
[00:39:11.157 --> 00:39:17.521]  So, .com forward slash LP to the end of the URL.
[00:39:18.462 --> 00:39:18.702]  Okay?
[00:39:20.435 --> 00:39:24.656]  Then you have to scroll down past, we will destroy ISIS.
[00:39:25.236 --> 00:39:26.496]  Win a dinner with Donald Trump.
[00:39:26.556 --> 00:39:28.037]  I mean, you'd think this stuff shouldn't be hidden.
[00:39:29.097 --> 00:39:31.378]  Together, we are going to make America great again.
[00:39:33.238 --> 00:39:35.118]  Number four, get America working again.
[00:39:35.719 --> 00:39:37.279]  None of this can be found for the front page.
[00:39:37.299 --> 00:39:38.939]  So I'm doing Trump a favor here.
[00:39:39.479 --> 00:39:42.320]  He doesn't have real war gaming when it comes to fighting election theft.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:48.382]  He doesn't have real war gaming when it comes to people pulling clips of Democrats saying, you try to take my gun, I'm going to kill you.
[00:39:49.062 --> 00:39:49.962]  Like Joe Biden said.
[00:39:51.735 --> 00:39:54.356]  To show how his statement is mild.
[00:39:55.676 --> 00:40:01.258]  We're doing the real campaign research weaponization here, okay?
[00:40:02.319 --> 00:40:04.819]  And the point is, never wait for orders from headquarters.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:05.920]  Go to the sound of the guns.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:14.683]  So after you've gone through all of those, down to number five, you click on volunteer to be a Trump election observer.
[00:40:15.592 --> 00:40:16.392]  And that's where you do it.
[00:40:16.713 --> 00:40:21.235]  And they are organizing it, and they're going to push for this.
[00:40:21.255 --> 00:40:22.916]  This is one of Trump's main initiatives.
[00:40:23.896 --> 00:40:32.320]  But there are some people in the campaign who aren't bad, but their heads are so in the establishment that they just always want to go with the same system before.
[00:40:34.601 --> 00:40:36.963]  Trump won the primaries a way nobody else has ever done it.
[00:40:37.223 --> 00:40:38.083]  Trump's been right along.
[00:40:38.123 --> 00:40:39.124]  His instincts are correct.
[00:40:39.344 --> 00:40:40.484]  He doesn't need to back off.
[00:40:40.524 --> 00:40:43.446]  He needs to get more aggressive, which, by the way, he's been doing.
[00:40:45.029 --> 00:40:47.051]  Taking the gloves off, putting brass knuckles on.
[00:40:47.992 --> 00:40:49.353]  Time for the dragon to breathe fire.
[00:40:49.874 --> 00:40:51.675]  It's time to really nail these people.
[00:40:52.316 --> 00:40:54.178]  And he's coming out talking about how ill she is.
[00:40:54.598 --> 00:40:57.701]  He's coming out talking about what liars they are and how he's running against the media.
[00:40:58.922 --> 00:41:00.023]  Not even against Crooked Hillary.
[00:41:00.223 --> 00:41:01.585]  He's running against the establishment.
[00:41:02.766 --> 00:41:03.947]  And then it's a referendum on that.
[00:41:03.987 --> 00:41:05.208]  It's not even about Donald Trump.
[00:41:05.348 --> 00:41:06.810]  And Politico makes a joke out of that.
[00:41:08.578 --> 00:41:09.739]  People ask for a champion.
[00:41:10.099 --> 00:41:10.759]  You've got one.
[00:41:10.959 --> 00:41:12.140]  What he's doing is amazing.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.661]  They create this background chatter, though, that that's not the case.
[00:41:14.981 --> 00:41:16.842]  We're also going to send out the URL.
[00:41:17.462 --> 00:41:19.103]  People are saying, hey, just give us the URL.
[00:41:19.323 --> 00:41:22.705]  Well, it's hard to do that on radio when the URL is so long.
[00:41:24.205 --> 00:41:28.608]  So we're going to post it in a little article on the front page of InfoWars.com.
[00:41:30.128 --> 00:41:34.350]  Here's how to sign up to be an election watcher in 2016.
[00:41:38.447 --> 00:41:41.290]  Or here's how to join Donald Trump to keep the elections fair.
[00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:45.053]  And then we'll have the link so you can copy it and spread it to everyone you know.
[00:41:48.456 --> 00:41:49.157]  You want the whole thing?
[00:41:49.197 --> 00:41:59.206]  It's DonaldJTrump.com forward slash LP forward slash volunteer dash 2 dash B dash A dash Trump dash election dash observer.
[00:41:59.466 --> 00:42:00.227]  Needle in a haystack.
[00:42:00.367 --> 00:42:02.328]  We're going to tweak this out in the next 10 minutes.
[00:42:02.669 --> 00:42:03.690]  Here's the URL.
[00:42:06.155 --> 00:42:11.777]  To be a election watcher or exit poller in 2016 for Trump.
[00:42:11.797 --> 00:42:13.998]  We're going to tweet it.
[00:42:14.018 --> 00:42:15.318]  We're going to put it on Facebook.
[00:42:15.538 --> 00:42:21.680]  And I'm going to send out a snippet of this show right now explaining all this to everyone that is a member of the InfoWars Insider.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.080]  It's free.
[00:42:22.401 --> 00:42:24.821]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:42:26.802 --> 00:42:29.403]  But you see stuff like this months.
[00:42:30.323 --> 00:42:32.744]  Almost impossible to find out how to get a dinner with Donald Trump.
[00:42:33.044 --> 00:42:34.965]  Almost impossible to find out
[00:42:37.563 --> 00:42:38.244]  Any of this stuff.
[00:42:39.966 --> 00:42:43.391]  Okay, if that isn't sabotage, it might as well be.
[00:42:43.451 --> 00:42:45.413]  It's an idiot savant of sabotage.
[00:42:47.917 --> 00:42:55.787]  So, I happen to know there's a certain people in Trump campaign that pull their hair out that Donald Trump
[00:42:58.487 --> 00:43:04.752]  He's talking about rigged elections, that Donald Trump is talking about Hillary's health, that Donald Trump is getting on all these issues.
[00:43:05.253 --> 00:43:07.094]  That's what's making him win in the past.
[00:43:07.134 --> 00:43:07.975]  And here's a newsflash.
[00:43:08.476 --> 00:43:12.119]  He is ahead in all the battleground states in internal scientific polling.
[00:43:12.339 --> 00:43:19.285]  And by the way, even Bloomberg's come out and admits that, and has another article admitting that he is in a dead heat nationally with Hillary.
[00:43:20.865 --> 00:43:22.805]  People say, why would Bloomberg be putting out an accurate poll?
[00:43:23.445 --> 00:43:28.606]  Because they're a business journal and want to actually have people that want to read them for real info.
[00:43:29.146 --> 00:43:32.867]  Now, some of their polls, because I've looked at the methodology, are scams.
[00:43:33.247 --> 00:43:37.788]  But still, they want to know and do put out polls where they want to gauge what's really happening.
[00:43:37.928 --> 00:43:46.250]  That's why you'll see one scientific poll where he's ahead and one where he's in a dead heat and another where he's 15 behind because they add, again, 15% more Democrats into many of these polls.
[00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:48.490]  I mean, this is real simple what they're doing.
[00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:59.257]  But they create this bandwagon with all these followers and all these empty people that some I've even seen are like, I was for Trump, but Hillary's getting in because he's really screwing up.
[00:43:59.277 --> 00:44:04.960]  Because the media says, oh, he's screwed up again, saying that Hillary's going to pack the courts and take our guns.
[00:44:05.301 --> 00:44:08.042]  And that then all we got left is the Second Amendment at that point.
[00:44:08.463 --> 00:44:11.024]  All he got there was a big fat giant gold star.
[00:44:13.666 --> 00:44:16.128]  I mean, that's what Ronald Reagan talks like that.
[00:44:17.651 --> 00:44:18.812]  Everybody talks like that.
[00:44:19.852 --> 00:44:30.817]  Charlton Heston, how have we gone from Charlton Heston, yeah, my cold dead hand, to now, oh, that's too much for me, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[00:44:31.458 --> 00:44:33.499]  He gave some mild statement.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.861]  And they made a huge hissy fit out of that.
[00:44:38.161 --> 00:44:40.482]  So I'm not a wishful thinker, everybody knows that.
[00:44:42.688 --> 00:44:44.729]  People could say I'm downright negative and pessimistic a lot.
[00:44:45.049 --> 00:44:47.870]  No, I want people to know what's really going on from my research.
[00:44:49.271 --> 00:44:52.472]  If Donald Trump was behind in all these battleground states, I would be telling you that.
[00:44:52.953 --> 00:44:53.353]  He's not.
[00:44:55.394 --> 00:44:57.595]  But folks, they want you to lose faith.
[00:44:57.635 --> 00:44:58.655]  They want you to go away.
[00:44:58.815 --> 00:44:59.756]  That's classic military.
[00:45:00.556 --> 00:45:01.937]  We had taken back
[00:45:02.816 --> 00:45:10.959]  More than a hundred islands, actually hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, was untold in some cases with so many little atolls and little keys.
[00:45:11.499 --> 00:45:19.182]  But over a hundred big islands that had troops on them and airfields with Japanese dug in and fighting to the death in the Pacific War, World War II.
[00:45:20.383 --> 00:45:24.905]  And we were island hopping, marching right up to Japan and they were swearing they were going to fight to the end.
[00:45:25.625 --> 00:45:27.466]  They had Tokyo Rose
[00:45:29.229 --> 00:45:38.376]  Broadcasting on shortwave and AM, millions of watts, you can hear AM all over the Pacific Ocean, playing the favorite songs of the GIs.
[00:45:38.396 --> 00:45:41.678]  Because the GIs couldn't get radio from home out there.
[00:45:41.718 --> 00:45:42.899]  They could only get Japanese radio.
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:52.566]  And it'd be, oh, you're sweeties at home, and I bet grandma might have died by now, but you haven't gotten a letter, and did you know we just beat you on all these islands, and you're losing.
[00:45:53.527 --> 00:45:57.310]  You're losing and failing, and the war is going to be lost for you, GI.
[00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:58.611]  But let me play you
[00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:06.893]  Some big band music to remind you of that sweetheart who's probably with a factory worker right now in the back of that car.
[00:46:08.654 --> 00:46:10.315]  You could give up any time though.
[00:46:12.297 --> 00:46:13.918]  You're losing!
[00:46:13.938 --> 00:46:15.499]  We ought to go on YouTube.
[00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:17.400]  I bet you can find the actual Tokyo Rose.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.322]  It was a bunch of women by that name, but there was one particular.
[00:46:22.383 --> 00:46:23.704]  And the Germans had one too.
[00:46:24.084 --> 00:46:25.345]  They would broadcast into the UK.
[00:46:30.256 --> 00:46:33.318]  Your boys are going down in the frosty North Atlantic tonight.
[00:46:33.358 --> 00:46:34.799]  You know you die in just a minute or so.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.262]  Yeah, it's about 30, 40 below zero in that water.
[00:46:39.282 --> 00:46:41.104]  Too bad.
[00:46:42.004 --> 00:46:46.127]  The weird thing is the Germans didn't seem to get that that was going to just piss everybody off and want to kill them.
[00:46:46.387 --> 00:46:54.273]  See, see, tyrants kind of get, see, people think, a lot of people, cowards go, the stuff you put out just demoralizes people, and man, it's negative, it scares everybody.
[00:46:55.171 --> 00:46:57.153]  I'm not looking for the people to get scared.
[00:46:58.214 --> 00:46:58.555]  Okay?
[00:46:58.615 --> 00:47:01.578]  I'm telling you what the globalists are really doing, because see, I think you're just like me.
[00:47:01.838 --> 00:47:05.362]  Somebody says they're hurting me and my family, I'm gonna do whatever I take to come after them.
[00:47:05.722 --> 00:47:08.965]  And you've seen what I've done in 21 years, there's a lot better men than me out there.
[00:47:09.125 --> 00:47:09.886]  What are you gonna do?
[00:47:10.547 --> 00:47:12.369]  Get up off your asses and let's do something.
[00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:15.112]  I'm never giving up, never giving in.
[00:47:15.672 --> 00:47:17.254]  We're better than these globalists, we're gonna beat them.
[00:47:20.236 --> 00:47:28.023]  Start bragging to me, you know, oh a lot of people went down to that frozen water, fighting for blah blah blah.
[00:47:28.043 --> 00:47:36.330]  Hitler said start bombing the population centers.
[00:47:38.031 --> 00:47:39.252]  That'll make the British give up.
[00:47:41.297 --> 00:47:42.938]  What a genius idea!
[00:47:43.178 --> 00:47:45.900]  But you know, maybe those were different Americans and different British back then.
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:53.424]  Maybe we are different people today, where you do something to us and we just crap our drawers and roll over and run up a big old stinking white flag!
[00:47:53.644 --> 00:47:54.724]  I'm tired of this stuff!
[00:47:55.685 --> 00:48:04.290]  I tell you how bad these people are because I believe you need to know the truth and I believe you're gonna want to do something instead of rolling over to these bastards!
[00:48:06.087 --> 00:48:13.470]  Now Hillary is having a nervous breakdown on top of whatever her weird medical issues are neurologically because she knows the whole world knows she's evil.
[00:48:14.431 --> 00:48:19.453]  And she knows there are people in government agencies that are actually leaking everything to Guccifer 2.0 and everybody else.
[00:48:21.214 --> 00:48:24.756]  And she knows the truth's coming out and she knows she's in trouble.
[00:48:27.337 --> 00:48:32.019]  So what are they thinking trying to take this dying possum across the gold line?
[00:48:33.456 --> 00:48:33.816]  Kane.
[00:48:34.597 --> 00:48:37.699]  Like Joe Big said yesterday, we gotta look at Kane and dig into him.
[00:48:37.739 --> 00:48:39.980]  And he is a Rothschild frontman.
[00:48:40.941 --> 00:48:43.162]  And we know he's been meeting with the Rothschilds.
[00:48:43.782 --> 00:48:44.883]  It's in the news!
[00:48:45.023 --> 00:48:52.868]  And he's been meeting with the heir apparent, the firstborn son of George Soros.
[00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:59.232]  And those arrogant people are so stupid.
[00:49:00.292 --> 00:49:02.894]  They sit there and shoot their mouths off.
[00:49:04.184 --> 00:49:07.607]  In front of their diplomatic, you know, they get, they're diplomats.
[00:49:08.047 --> 00:49:09.468]  They get diplomatic immunity.
[00:49:09.848 --> 00:49:17.314]  Government and private contractor agencies pick them up as security and take them to little, little Hillary meetings and little, little, little Cain meetings.
[00:49:17.814 --> 00:49:22.978]  And then they sit there and talk about what they're going to do to Donald Trump and how they could false flag for Hillary.
[00:49:23.078 --> 00:49:23.459]  Oh yeah.
[00:49:24.299 --> 00:49:24.640]  Oh yeah.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:25.160]  Oh yeah.
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:25.740]  Mm-hmm.
[00:49:26.401 --> 00:49:27.542]  And you're so arrogant.
[00:49:27.842 --> 00:49:32.586]  You don't think people that have served four, five, six, eight, ten, fifteen tours
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:38.242]  And the guys standing around you listening to all this don't know exactly who you are?
[00:49:38.422 --> 00:49:42.964]  They're not the general public that doesn't know who you are when you're walking along the beach looking at your prey.
[00:49:43.444 --> 00:49:46.725]  They know who you are, dumbass.
[00:49:48.926 --> 00:49:50.347]  And they hear everything you're saying.
[00:49:50.767 --> 00:49:54.328]  And then they're going and telling everybody else in the government and the FBI and the CIA.
[00:49:54.528 --> 00:49:55.669]  It's all decompartmentalized.
[00:49:55.809 --> 00:49:57.230]  They're like, oh my God, it's all true.
[00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:58.010]  They're out to get us.
[00:50:00.868 --> 00:50:01.888]  Alex Jones is right.
[00:50:02.448 --> 00:50:03.309]  Matt Drudge is right.
[00:50:03.489 --> 00:50:04.269]  What are we going to do?
[00:50:05.809 --> 00:50:08.230]  We have now reached detonation point.
[00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:11.231]  They can take me out at this point and there's nothing you can do.
[00:50:12.731 --> 00:50:14.472]  That's real satisfaction filth!
[00:50:15.592 --> 00:50:22.134]  That's living for something that isn't about you and your hunchback and hating everybody and your devil worship.
[00:50:23.955 --> 00:50:24.635]  All your crap.
[00:50:27.179 --> 00:50:28.640]  You think you're going to take down the West?
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.622]  Good luck, sucker!
[00:50:31.423 --> 00:50:32.003]  Look right here.
[00:50:32.844 --> 00:50:33.244]  Memo!
[00:50:33.845 --> 00:50:39.650]  Soros Group funded opposition research on critics of radical Islam and works to shut them down.
[00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:44.414]  You think I need a hack to know they're up to that and running radical Islam?
[00:50:45.447 --> 00:50:46.407]  Shot a video on it Saturday.
[00:50:47.167 --> 00:50:55.269]  Oh, Glenn Beck now is the straw man who comes out on national radio and TV to apologize for conservatives and say we are racist and bad.
[00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:58.329]  And I'm for Black Lives Matter now.
[00:50:58.769 --> 00:50:59.569]  Oh, we have the clip.
[00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:03.150]  Oh, see, they can't really get a real patriot.
[00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:06.251]  So they have this Judas goat come and say, I was wrong.
[00:51:06.271 --> 00:51:07.591]  I was one of them.
[00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:09.411]  You were always an enemy agent.
[00:51:13.532 --> 00:51:14.612]  Hey, you voting for Hillary Clinton?
[00:51:15.472 --> 00:51:16.452]  So what are your big issues?
[00:51:16.532 --> 00:51:17.533]  Are you for gun control?
[00:51:18.173 --> 00:51:18.493]  Yes.
[00:51:19.093 --> 00:51:19.894]  Eliminate him!
[00:51:20.314 --> 00:51:22.275]  Take him out of the hands of the people!
[00:51:23.595 --> 00:51:24.816]  I trust Hillary!
[00:51:25.076 --> 00:51:25.976]  Hillary's the best!
[00:51:26.256 --> 00:51:26.976]  Go Hillary!
[00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:28.017]  Disturbing.
[00:51:28.277 --> 00:51:28.637]  Disturbing.
[00:51:29.217 --> 00:51:31.918]  Who you voting for?
[00:51:32.559 --> 00:51:33.459]  Who I vote for?
[00:51:33.499 --> 00:51:33.779]  Yeah.
[00:51:34.059 --> 00:51:34.299]  Quit!
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.760]  Nah, I ain't giving you no change.
[00:51:37.261 --> 00:51:38.941]  I ain't giving you no change.
[00:51:39.001 --> 00:51:39.942]  Come on, buddy, please!
[00:51:40.122 --> 00:51:40.962]  Vote for Hillary.
[00:51:41.042 --> 00:51:42.783]  Trump is not gonna get the vote.
[00:51:42.903 --> 00:51:43.443]  Disturbing.
[00:51:46.187 --> 00:51:48.408]  Alright, we got the Peace Bernie bike coming down here.
[00:51:49.248 --> 00:51:52.329]  Uh yeah, Bernie is like the best candidate I've seen.
[00:51:52.349 --> 00:51:57.350]  People are trying to climb over the fence now to get in to where the DNC is taking place.
[00:51:57.630 --> 00:52:00.031]  Of course they tried to shut him down because it's rigged.
[00:52:00.051 --> 00:52:02.331]  As far as I'm concerned, she's cleared.
[00:52:02.851 --> 00:52:05.132]  Hillary Clinton is cleared from all charges.
[00:52:05.732 --> 00:52:07.953]  And I am for guns, gun, gun control.
[00:52:08.273 --> 00:52:14.755]  You don't have our vote, you don't have our money, and Trump's gonna plant you like a pancake, Hillary.
[00:52:14.775 --> 00:52:17.636]  Obama's totally awesome, we're gonna miss him.
[00:52:17.656 --> 00:52:20.237]  F you, Hillary Clinton.
[00:52:20.257 --> 00:52:23.277]  We're not voting for Hillary in no way, shape, form, or fashion.
[00:52:23.718 --> 00:52:24.298]  That's a wrap.
[00:52:24.378 --> 00:52:27.759]  Note, like, everything that she's done, everything that she's about.
[00:52:28.719 --> 00:52:30.240]  We can not just fall in line.
[00:52:30.601 --> 00:52:31.982]  No matter if Bernie's supporting her.
[00:52:32.722 --> 00:52:33.963]  I don't care who's supporting her.
[00:52:34.183 --> 00:52:34.944]  I'm not supporting her.
[00:52:35.104 --> 00:52:35.765]  And that's just that.
[00:52:36.625 --> 00:52:38.127]  She doesn't hold none of our values.
[00:52:38.187 --> 00:52:39.147]  She holds no one's values.
[00:52:39.167 --> 00:52:40.028]  She's not accountable.
[00:52:40.288 --> 00:52:41.749]  She's not held accountable for anything.
[00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:43.711]  She wasn't held accountable for the emails.
[00:52:44.231 --> 00:52:46.013]  She wasn't held accountable for Benghazi.
[00:52:46.313 --> 00:52:48.134]  She wasn't held accountable for Libya.
[00:52:48.354 --> 00:52:49.756]  She's not held accountable for anything.
[00:52:49.776 --> 00:52:52.958]  So nobody in their right mind should even think about voting for that lady.
[00:52:52.978 --> 00:52:59.405]  What do you think about the FBI director basically saying every reason why she was guilty, but then saying she should be let off?
[00:52:59.805 --> 00:53:04.090]  He was paid, or he knows that a hit team will come after him.
[00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.810]  That's what I believe.
[00:53:04.850 --> 00:53:06.132]  You think Bernie Sanders was paid off?
[00:53:06.552 --> 00:53:08.054]  No, I don't think Bernie was paid off.
[00:53:08.434 --> 00:53:10.676]  We're talking about Director James Comey.
[00:53:12.591 --> 00:53:13.712]  He knows something that we don't know.
[00:53:13.752 --> 00:53:15.753]  You know what I mean?
[00:53:15.833 --> 00:53:16.913]  Something happened.
[00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:20.075]  His life was threatened, I bet.
[00:53:20.535 --> 00:53:21.736]  Bernie's life was threatened.
[00:53:22.136 --> 00:53:29.820]  For him to do that, for him to say we're going to a contested convention and then give in, for him to think that... I just can't fathom it.
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:31.261]  Like, I really can't fathom it anymore.
[00:53:31.281 --> 00:53:33.302]  Like, it's just crazy.
[00:53:33.322 --> 00:53:36.363]  Why do you think that the election was stolen?
[00:53:36.403 --> 00:53:40.685]  I mean, do you think that Hillary is there to... Eleven states that have reported election fraud.
[00:53:40.865 --> 00:53:41.626]  Eleven states.
[00:53:42.574 --> 00:53:44.435]  That goes beyond the margin of error.
[00:53:44.876 --> 00:53:46.117]  Why is Hillary doing this?
[00:53:46.537 --> 00:53:47.578]  Why is Hillary doing this?
[00:53:47.618 --> 00:53:48.659]  What's her game plan?
[00:53:49.479 --> 00:53:50.040]  Me, personally?
[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:51.881]  I think she wants to go to war with Russia.
[00:53:51.961 --> 00:53:52.662]  That's what I think.
[00:53:53.362 --> 00:53:54.883]  Hell no, DNC!
[00:53:55.063 --> 00:53:56.725]  We won't vote for Hillary!
[00:53:57.005 --> 00:53:58.386]  Hell no, DNC!
[00:53:58.426 --> 00:54:00.307]  We won't vote for Hillary!
[00:54:00.347 --> 00:54:03.690]  Freedom of pressure, idiot!
[00:54:15.054 --> 00:54:19.555]  I wish a buck was still silver, it was back.
[00:54:22.596 --> 00:54:29.618]  I wish a buck was still silver, it was back when the country was strong.
[00:54:30.218 --> 00:54:34.199]  I really feel sad, because it hit me and all dawned on me just now.
[00:54:34.219 --> 00:54:38.140]  It's dawned on me so many times, but it dawned so hard this time.
[00:54:39.801 --> 00:54:40.681]  We really are soft.
[00:54:44.127 --> 00:54:51.171]  The globalists, I've been told, rub their hands together and they say, Jones is dangerous, but he demoralizes people by really exposing our true agenda to them.
[00:54:51.972 --> 00:54:53.152]  And so that makes people scared.
[00:54:53.172 --> 00:54:58.676]  And then I'm here, knowing their agenda, that makes me want to fight them.
[00:55:01.217 --> 00:55:13.645]  But see, from the mind of a tyrant, who's never really done anything, but had other men fight their battles for him, they think intimidating and threatening people and saying you're scum and saying you're filth demoralizes them.
[00:55:14.841 --> 00:55:21.823]  When they did that to the folks in the UK back then in England, all it did was making them raging angry.
[00:55:24.344 --> 00:55:26.785]  And the war output and everything just exploded.
[00:55:27.765 --> 00:55:38.969]  And it was the same thing with the Japanese broadcasting insulting messages at our sailors and marines in the Pacific.
[00:55:41.263 --> 00:55:42.283]  And it was a phenomenon.
[00:55:42.323 --> 00:55:44.104]  Our newspapers were like, don't they understand?
[00:55:44.144 --> 00:55:45.444]  This just makes us want to fight harder.
[00:55:46.504 --> 00:55:47.744]  But see, that was different people.
[00:55:49.585 --> 00:55:50.705]  Look what they've done to us.
[00:55:50.805 --> 00:55:51.705]  I don't care who you are.
[00:55:51.925 --> 00:55:53.366]  You mess with anybody in the world.
[00:55:53.626 --> 00:55:55.766]  I don't care if they're in Africa or Latin America or wherever.
[00:55:55.986 --> 00:55:58.427]  You do that 50 years ago, they would fight you.
[00:55:59.867 --> 00:56:05.428]  But the globalists just rub our faces in everything and just, ah, ah, and just, ah, all the things.
[00:56:07.629 --> 00:56:09.149]  Let's play a clip of Tokyo Rose.
[00:56:09.369 --> 00:56:09.689]  Here it is.
[00:56:11.329 --> 00:56:15.910]  They will give you a medal, G.I., but only after you are dead.
[00:56:18.511 --> 00:56:22.211]  Your government lies to you every day, poor soldier.
[00:56:24.992 --> 00:56:27.012]  You have lost this war, G.I.
[00:56:27.612 --> 00:56:29.393]  Your army will leave you behind.
[00:56:29.413 --> 00:56:31.553]  They do not care about you.
[00:56:31.573 --> 00:56:37.475]  G.I., your government has betrayed you.
[00:56:37.915 --> 00:56:39.595]  You will not return for you.
[00:56:43.058 --> 00:56:46.039]  G.I., your airplanes bombed your own men.
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:47.860]  You are not safe here.
[00:56:51.542 --> 00:56:52.703]  The skies are dangerous.
[00:56:52.963 --> 00:56:54.924]  See, that's political correctness, but back then.
[00:56:55.564 --> 00:56:58.826]  Oh, your airplanes made a mistake.
[00:56:59.006 --> 00:57:01.007]  Or, oh, the cops shot an innocent person.
[00:57:01.247 --> 00:57:04.869]  Now your whole Army Air Corps and Navy Air Corps are bad.
[00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:11.052]  When you look at George Soros, some of the people, they are undermining our country.
[00:57:11.949 --> 00:57:14.511]  And they've done it to dozens of other nations!
[00:57:14.871 --> 00:57:16.272]  They're running the Arab Spring!
[00:57:16.452 --> 00:57:17.733]  They overthrew Ukraine!
[00:57:17.913 --> 00:57:19.354]  They're starting a war with Russia!
[00:57:19.534 --> 00:57:21.055]  They're trying to start a race war here!
[00:57:21.275 --> 00:57:23.197]  These are outrageous criminals!
[00:57:24.278 --> 00:57:33.124]  They know if Trump gets in, there's going to be hearings, there's going to be investigations, and yes, there's nowhere you globalists are going to be able to run, and that's why they're crapping their pants.
[00:57:35.385 --> 00:57:37.487]  You think killing Trump's going to stop this movement?
[00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:39.288]  You think shutting me up's going to stop it?
[00:57:40.882 --> 00:57:41.922]  We're not weak-minded.
[00:57:43.263 --> 00:57:43.923]  We know history.
[00:57:44.464 --> 00:57:45.584]  And we know where this is going.
[00:57:45.784 --> 00:57:47.825]  And you people just can't deal with throwbacks.
[00:57:51.447 --> 00:57:56.289]  That's what... My dad's dad called men.
[00:57:57.650 --> 00:58:00.851]  But even in his day, he'd talk about men that were even a lot stronger than him.
[00:58:00.891 --> 00:58:02.732]  He'd say, that's a caveman, that's a real throwback.
[00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:04.633]  But being a caveman doesn't mean you're some wimp.
[00:58:04.933 --> 00:58:08.795]  And I'm proud of the fact, before my grandfather died, he told my dad, he said, you got a throwback right there.
[00:58:13.291 --> 00:58:14.451]  I'm so pissed at these people.
[00:58:15.032 --> 00:58:15.652]  God Almighty.
[00:58:16.272 --> 00:58:20.794]  They know glyphosate is killing women by the millions.
[00:58:22.014 --> 00:58:22.774]  And they think it's funny.
[00:58:24.075 --> 00:58:26.135]  And they got the nerve to run ads all day long.
[00:58:28.676 --> 00:58:32.257]  The very same companies involved in it trying to raise money for breast cancer research.
[00:58:33.838 --> 00:58:39.460]  And when you look at people like George Soros, you're looking at a sack of demonic filth the likes of which this planet has never seen.
[00:58:41.561 --> 00:58:42.621]  And they're so arrogant.
[00:58:44.577 --> 00:58:46.798]  That they think they're invincible like Tokyo Rose.
[00:58:47.438 --> 00:58:49.439]  You're not invincible, you piece of filth.
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:52.881]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:52.901 --> 00:58:55.522]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:00.865 --> 00:59:07.030]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:10.292]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:59:10.632 --> 00:59:15.816]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:59:16.236 --> 00:59:22.220]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:59:22.361 --> 00:59:25.503]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:59:25.643 --> 00:59:27.084]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[00:59:27.304 --> 00:59:31.448]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:59:31.628 --> 00:59:34.491]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:36.153]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:59:36.233 --> 00:59:39.436]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:59:39.716 --> 00:59:42.039]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:59:42.319 --> 00:59:43.280]  It's in powder form.
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:46.083]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:59:46.263 --> 00:59:46.864]  I take this.
[00:59:46.964 --> 00:59:48.665]  This is the product that I take.
[00:59:48.786 --> 00:59:50.747]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:59:51.568 --> 00:59:52.328]  We fight the globals.
[00:59:52.368 --> 00:59:53.209]  We fight the New World Order.

[00:59:58.110 --> 00:59:59.691]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:12.418 --> 01:00:19.024]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:36.384]  Dan Mangino has been defending this republic for most of his adult life.
[01:00:36.825 --> 01:00:39.850]  Former high-level Secret Service agent ran the far end of tales.
[01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:43.155]  He's going to be joining us to talk about the campaign and more.
[01:00:45.143 --> 01:00:48.044]  I will ask him if he's gotten the information about Hillary's health.
[01:00:48.604 --> 01:00:51.804]  They condition him so much to not talk.
[01:00:52.704 --> 01:00:54.845]  And I understand if you actually have a president, you shouldn't.
[01:00:54.865 --> 01:00:56.625]  This is not a president.
[01:00:57.085 --> 01:00:58.465]  It is a globalist occupier.
[01:00:58.505 --> 01:00:59.346]  That's not rhetoric.
[01:00:59.486 --> 01:00:59.926]  It's a fact.
[01:01:00.666 --> 01:01:09.447]  And Hillary is run by George Soros, who is running the whole destabilization program of the country and the cop-killing operations.
[01:01:15.655 --> 01:01:16.516]  I'm here doing all this.
[01:01:16.796 --> 01:01:19.058]  It's time for people just to start standing up.
[01:01:19.118 --> 01:01:19.779]  I'll tell you right now.
[01:01:20.399 --> 01:01:22.020]  That's why they killed Michael Hastings.
[01:01:22.901 --> 01:01:28.486]  He discovered incredible information and went on TV a few days before and said, look, the whole government's been taken over by foreign interests.
[01:01:29.267 --> 01:01:30.728]  I'm about to release incredible information.
[01:01:31.348 --> 01:01:32.589]  The whole press is controlled.
[01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:33.891]  We're in a crisis situation.
[01:01:33.911 --> 01:01:34.651]  You've got to get ready.
[01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:35.712]  It's unbelievable what I've discovered.
[01:01:36.032 --> 01:01:39.695]  And it was just all sorts of stuff because we've talked to folks that talked to the family before they got threatened.
[01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:43.637]  And his wife did a 180 where she was highest level National Security Council.
[01:01:44.037 --> 01:01:45.358]  He was definitely a spook as well.
[01:01:45.898 --> 01:01:50.159]  And whenever he found out, boy, he was running away from Homeland Security when his car blew up.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.561]  We already know what they're doing.
[01:01:58.982 --> 01:02:01.123]  They don't kill you once you already know it and say it.
[01:02:01.523 --> 01:02:06.125]  They kill respected journalists who discover it on their own and are gonna go tell the world.
[01:02:07.305 --> 01:02:08.566]  Truth is, it's already out.
[01:02:08.666 --> 01:02:09.686]  The whole stinking thing.
[01:02:11.325 --> 01:02:13.127]  This little detail or that little detail, whatever.
[01:02:13.348 --> 01:02:18.615]  Do we need WikiLeaks to tell us Hillary Clinton is putting daily talking points out to over 100 media outlets?
[01:02:19.676 --> 01:02:23.562]  And then everybody under that takes those talking points and regurgitates it down to the local level?
[01:02:25.162 --> 01:02:32.965]  That there is a circle jerk of them just vomiting in each other's mouths, ring around the Rosie over and over again, and that's why nobody wants to watch it!
[01:02:33.565 --> 01:02:35.286]  It's the most canned garbage!
[01:02:35.946 --> 01:02:42.049]  With a bunch of con artists trying to look as convincing as they can, up there vomiting recycled throw-up!
[01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:48.952]  So, Bongino's gonna be popping in, and then I didn't get to all the stuff I wanted to cover last hour.
[01:02:48.972 --> 01:02:54.634]  Amazing Trump news, scary Trump news, important Trump news, the latest stuff going on in Milwaukee,
[01:02:57.125 --> 01:02:57.985]  We're going to break it all down.
[01:02:58.085 --> 01:03:01.306]  In fact, let's play some of the Milwaukee clips now just because they're so insane.
[01:03:02.067 --> 01:03:06.628]  I mean, this is what Mind Control and MTV and Sumner Redstone and that whole fake hip-hop thing did.
[01:03:07.489 --> 01:03:08.849]  Now, the first hip-hop wasn't like this.
[01:03:08.889 --> 01:03:10.430]  They got it and turned it into gangster garbage.
[01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:18.712]  Some of the early stuff, I liked a lot of it myself when I was a kid, but it just turned into that whole death culture, and that was all weaponized by design.
[01:03:19.573 --> 01:03:24.915]  But let's play the family member who's at the press conference saying, let's burn down the suburbs.
[01:03:25.355 --> 01:03:25.835]  Let's play that.
[01:03:28.161 --> 01:03:29.503]  We need our weed.
[01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:50.722]  Now, again, this is how weaponized media will work from the Globals.
[01:03:50.762 --> 01:03:54.404]  They'll say, because we make fun of that, we're making fun of women that do hair attachments.
[01:03:54.464 --> 01:03:57.245]  I mean, people across the board do that.
[01:03:57.605 --> 01:04:00.726]  It's funny saying, though, we need our hair attachments.
[01:04:01.187 --> 01:04:03.447]  It'd be like saying we need our curling irons.
[01:04:04.108 --> 01:04:07.649]  I mean, it's just so ridiculously decadent and disconnected.
[01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:13.672]  Our poorest Americans are better off than most poor people in almost every other country, and we've got problems.
[01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:20.734]  Again, the entitlement level of this is just crazy.
[01:04:21.755 --> 01:04:28.578]  What is it, her brother is a convicted felon, all this stuff, running around waving a gun in the middle of the night at a black cop.
[01:04:29.759 --> 01:04:31.940]  You really think the black cop shot him because he was black?
[01:04:33.481 --> 01:04:35.862]  No, I think he shot him because he's a guy waving a gun.
[01:04:36.883 --> 01:04:38.784]  And the truth is, police shoot.
[01:04:40.077 --> 01:04:46.159]  In confrontations, whites, many times more often than blacks, because they feel more comfortable about it.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:51.081]  And because they'll go into more dangerous situations in a predominantly white neighborhood.
[01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:52.182]  The police have told her about this.
[01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:58.444]  And quite frankly, man, I tell you, I've seen some poor white neighborhoods.
[01:04:58.504 --> 01:04:59.525]  I don't want to go into these, Texas.
[01:04:59.545 --> 01:05:01.485]  Same thing with some of these poor black neighborhoods.
[01:05:01.545 --> 01:05:04.146]  I mean, listen, they don't want the cops there.
[01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:07.988]  The cops are pulling out of these neighborhoods and the crime rates are going straight up.
[01:05:10.788 --> 01:05:12.129]  Article by Business Insider.
[01:05:12.289 --> 01:05:14.831]  Americans are getting concerned about rising home prices.
[01:05:15.052 --> 01:05:17.273]  The gap between supply and demand is widening.
[01:05:17.433 --> 01:05:22.077]  It's being dubbed the new housing crisis, and the gap is taking median house prices through the roof.
[01:05:22.317 --> 01:05:27.502]  San Jose is the first city to have an MHP of $1 million for a one-family house last quarter.
[01:05:27.642 --> 01:05:37.810]  Low interest rates are creating higher demand to buy homes, according to the Consumer Sentiment Survey from the University of Michigan, which also states, quote, home buying has become particularly dependent on low interest rates
[01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:41.173]  With net references to low interest rates spontaneously mentioned by 48%.
[01:05:41.413 --> 01:05:45.537]  This figure has been exceeded in only two months in the past 10 years.
[01:05:45.857 --> 01:05:49.340]  In English, low rates may rise soon if the Fed changes its tune.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.842]  So buyers want to take advantage of the rates now.
[01:05:52.123 --> 01:05:53.784]  Rates are low, but not housing prices.
[01:05:53.984 --> 01:05:58.248]  Quote, low housing prices were cited by just 25%, according to the survey's release.
[01:05:58.388 --> 01:05:59.750]  The lowest figure in 10 years.
[01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:02.732]  This is starting to create a dissonance of sorts in Americans.
[01:06:02.912 --> 01:06:07.396]  Little do many of them know, a bubble is set to burst and what's to come is yet the worst.
[01:06:07.616 --> 01:06:10.238]  This is Gabe Golddiamond for InfoWars.com.
[01:06:10.658 --> 01:06:19.746]  If you can't see the irony in having a gun ban enforced by men with guns, well then you fail to understand why the Second Amendment was written in the first place.
[01:06:19.786 --> 01:06:22.608]  Throughout history, only slaves are disarmed.
[01:06:22.748 --> 01:06:26.509]  A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[01:06:26.629 --> 01:06:27.749]  The right of the people.
[01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:28.969]  The right of the people.
[01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.949]  The right of the people.
[01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:32.470]  To keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:41.411]  For all of you actors out there who go to your red carpet events, surrounded by full battle rattle SWAT teams, while you accept your awards for your latest violent movie.
[01:06:41.751 --> 01:06:50.633]  For all you politicians who spend your nine to five days scheming up ways to take away my second amendment rights, meanwhile you have first responders on site there to protect you.
[01:06:50.993 --> 01:06:51.593]  I say this.
[01:06:51.934 --> 01:06:53.034]  Come and take it.
[01:06:53.214 --> 01:06:55.716]  I have a strict gun control policy.
[01:06:56.176 --> 01:06:58.778]  If there's a gun around, I want to control it.
[01:06:59.418 --> 01:07:00.098]  Clint Eastwood.
[01:07:00.318 --> 01:07:00.859]  Go ahead.
[01:07:01.879 --> 01:07:02.820]  Make my day.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:07.943]  Dads demand guns because it's me that's got to get up and go check out that noise at 2am.
[01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:19.769]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:28.076]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:28.237 --> 01:07:32.921]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:33.101 --> 01:07:39.823]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:39.883 --> 01:07:46.965]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:47.065 --> 01:07:53.947]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:54.087 --> 01:07:58.448]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:08:22.225 --> 01:08:23.807]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:08:24.368 --> 01:08:31.979]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:41.112 --> 01:08:44.377]  Dan Bongino is our guest for just a segment or two.
[01:08:44.397 --> 01:08:48.383]  He, of course, is a best-selling author.
[01:08:48.564 --> 01:08:50.907]  He was a special agent with the Secret Service.
[01:08:50.927 --> 01:08:51.909]  Before that, a New York cop.
[01:08:51.969 --> 01:08:54.152]  He ended up leaving the foreign details.
[01:08:54.553 --> 01:08:56.156]  He was a senior Secret Service agent.
[01:08:56.656 --> 01:09:03.018]  And obviously he's never released any secrets about Obama or about the Clintons when she was in the State Department or anything else he saw.
[01:09:04.158 --> 01:09:11.299]  But he has been harassed and had a lot of mysterious things happen just for coming out and saying he politically opposes them.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:22.862]  Now we have the emails that came out over a month ago that show the Democratic Party has been directing the media on what to say and having people dress up like Bernie Sanders supporters to go attack Trump supporters.
[01:09:22.902 --> 01:09:24.563]  Now, we knew this from our sources.
[01:09:24.643 --> 01:09:25.643]  Now it's confirmed.
[01:09:26.263 --> 01:09:27.204]  I also wanted to talk to him.
[01:09:27.224 --> 01:09:27.904]  We're not going to play it.
[01:09:27.924 --> 01:09:29.805]  It went viral last week, for the interest of time.
[01:09:30.145 --> 01:09:31.045]  He was on Don Lemon.
[01:09:31.546 --> 01:09:33.447]  And Lemon was saying, oh, this is so horrible.
[01:09:33.507 --> 01:09:37.409]  Trump, you know, is out here calling for the assassination of Hillary.
[01:09:38.416 --> 01:09:45.479]  And then basically trying to shut off Bongino, who's trained to know what real threats are, and I want him to be able to elaborate and not be interrupted here, even though he did destroy Lemon.
[01:09:46.179 --> 01:09:48.920]  I'm not a rocket scientist or a criminologist, but I'll tell you this.
[01:09:49.561 --> 01:10:00.465]  Trump was spouting the standard from my cold dead hands statement, or what I said, 1776 commences again, that everyone says that when all else is lost, we have a Second Amendment.
[01:10:00.705 --> 01:10:02.446]  That's basically the Declaration of Independence.
[01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:04.800]  Now, that's what I got from it.
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:07.563]  In fact, I thought it was milquetoast compared to even stuff Reagan would say.
[01:10:07.583 --> 01:10:10.765]  He was just kind of like, well, it's just the judges and they take it away.
[01:10:10.825 --> 01:10:14.648]  Well, it's nothing you can do unless, I guess, maybe the Second Amendment folks think they can do something.
[01:10:15.029 --> 01:10:19.592]  I mean, that was just kind of relaying a cliché of the Second Amendment.
[01:10:20.353 --> 01:10:31.862]  And then I have the clips where, again, I have all these media pundits and other people, including the Vice President, saying, if Obama tries to take my guns, I got my Beretta and I know how to use it, he's going to have a problem.
[01:10:32.042 --> 01:10:33.403]  Now, for me, that was a clear threat.
[01:10:33.883 --> 01:10:34.884]  It was a clear joke.
[01:10:35.244 --> 01:10:40.949]  But he was saying to the colloquialism of the grassroots Democrats, from my cold, dead hand.
[01:10:41.909 --> 01:10:43.691]  Mr. Bongino, is that an accurate statement, do you think?
[01:10:45.293 --> 01:10:48.615]  Yeah, I think what he was trying to do was get out the vote.
[01:10:48.775 --> 01:10:54.239]  I mean, I think he was clearly trying to marshal people who care about the right to self-protection, Alex.
[01:10:54.259 --> 01:10:55.379]  You know, it matters to them.
[01:10:55.399 --> 01:10:58.742]  And Alex, let me just be clear on this from the start.
[01:10:58.982 --> 01:11:00.283]  I'm not a Trump surrogate.
[01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:03.144]  I don't speak to him, the campaign.
[01:11:03.164 --> 01:11:04.765]  I'm doing my own thing.
[01:11:04.805 --> 01:11:06.467]  I have my own campaign in Florida to run.
[01:11:07.575 --> 01:11:11.638]  I went on there to defend what I think is liberty and conservative values.
[01:11:11.698 --> 01:11:12.759]  You were a Cruz guy!
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:13.800]  You were a Cruz guy!
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:14.341]  I was a Cruz guy!
[01:11:14.461 --> 01:11:15.081]  Exactly!
[01:11:15.421 --> 01:11:16.362]  No kidding!
[01:11:16.382 --> 01:11:18.504]  That's the most amazing part of this whole thing.
[01:11:18.744 --> 01:11:19.985]  And I even said it in the interview.
[01:11:20.305 --> 01:11:28.572]  But Alex, this is why what happened with Don Lemon and Trump's comments, this is why this is so destructive and why in this election this matters so much.
[01:11:29.344 --> 01:11:31.326]  And I know you know this on your show specifically.
[01:11:31.686 --> 01:11:41.854]  Once we allow the left-leaning media, which is what most of them are, to paint conservative or liberty-based talk as inherently violent, what do you think the next step is, Alex?
[01:11:41.894 --> 01:11:43.275]  The next step is censorship.
[01:11:43.695 --> 01:11:44.896]  You can't allow this to happen.
[01:11:44.916 --> 01:11:55.244]  So I'm asking your listeners, whether you support Trump, Cruz, Rubio, Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Joey Baga Donuts, I don't care who you support, do not allow them to do this.
[01:11:55.649 --> 01:12:03.433]  Because once they do it, it's the next step towards suppression of free speech, which the left is always... And as usual, you cut right to the heart.
[01:12:03.834 --> 01:12:04.834]  They're censoring in Europe.
[01:12:04.854 --> 01:12:05.795]  They're starting to censor here.
[01:12:05.835 --> 01:12:08.736]  They admit they want to censor us because they can't compete with our ideas.
[01:12:08.776 --> 01:12:09.577]  And you hit the nail on the head.
[01:12:09.897 --> 01:12:11.758]  They are wanting to say it's radical.
[01:12:11.818 --> 01:12:13.679]  They want to put out these law enforcement advisements.
[01:12:14.059 --> 01:12:18.822]  I mean, they even tried to ban in the Navy the Gadsden flag that was the first flag of the U.S.
[01:12:18.882 --> 01:12:19.162]  Navy.
[01:12:19.362 --> 01:12:20.363]  I mean, they mean business.
[01:12:21.451 --> 01:12:32.995]  Right, they do, and I'm glad you pointed out the fact that, one, Trump never mentioned the word gun when he was talking about, he said the Second Amendment people, I don't know, that's his quote, exactly.
[01:12:33.375 --> 01:12:38.097]  Almost verbatim, I may have missed a two-word or three-letter word in there, whatever.
[01:12:38.337 --> 01:12:39.917]  But he said Second Amendment people, I don't know.
[01:12:40.278 --> 01:12:41.498]  Joe Biden said.
[01:12:41.978 --> 01:12:43.399]  Oh, he comes for my Beretta.
[01:12:43.639 --> 01:12:50.862]  And then Mrs. Clinton, I don't know if you remember this one, Alex, in 2008 when she was running against Barack Obama and was getting a butt kick and wouldn't get out of the race.
[01:12:51.182 --> 01:12:53.863]  An editorial board said, well, you know, why are you still in this race?
[01:12:53.883 --> 01:12:54.423]  You're going to lose.
[01:12:54.743 --> 01:12:57.864]  And she said, well, you know, Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June.
[01:12:57.884 --> 01:12:59.025]  Wait, wait, what?
[01:12:59.805 --> 01:13:05.087]  Did she just imply that Barack Obama could potentially be assassinated?
[01:13:05.107 --> 01:13:06.027]  That's why she's in the race?
[01:13:06.227 --> 01:13:20.232]  As a senior former Secret Service agent trained, I mean like no one else, on how to assess a real threat, to me that was a very mafioso, sly way to directly threaten Obama at a time that we know they were at each other's throats.
[01:13:21.357 --> 01:13:30.099]  Well, I think what happens with politics is we tend to, you know, you look at these things and you say, all right, they're running for office and people say all kinds of desperate things right across.
[01:13:30.459 --> 01:13:37.341]  I think it was clear when you contextualize all these statements, they were imprudently worded and probably could have been worded better.
[01:13:37.561 --> 01:13:41.682]  But the question you opened up with the show with, which is the important one, was this a threat?
[01:13:41.702 --> 01:13:43.202]  The answer is, of course not.
[01:13:43.502 --> 01:13:45.523]  And what's sickening about this whole thing, Alex,
[01:13:45.985 --> 01:13:46.365]  It's illegal.
[01:14:02.219 --> 01:14:04.741]  To try and put a muzzle on conservatives.
[01:14:04.761 --> 01:14:05.161]  Exactly.
[01:14:05.201 --> 01:14:22.074]  In fact, I put together a news piece that we aired yesterday where I pointed out just that, that when Heston said it was okay, when I said it was okay, when everybody else said it, and Ronald Reagan said it, and Ice-T said it was okay, but suddenly he puts out a mild, wimpy form of the statement, and then they act like it's the end of the world.
[01:14:22.294 --> 01:14:28.219]  That shows they're trying to change the Overton window to make that basically illegal.
[01:14:29.335 --> 01:14:31.997]  Right, and what they want to do also, yes, you're right.
[01:14:32.338 --> 01:14:39.324]  They want to frighten conservatives and libertarians and liberty-minded folks in the future from being able to discuss this issue either.
[01:14:39.604 --> 01:14:49.232]  You know, every time they do this, people say to themselves, whether advertently or inadvertently, they go, oh gosh, if I bring up this Second Amendment thing, some media type is going to say I'm calling for violence.
[01:14:49.372 --> 01:14:51.094]  Do you understand that this is what they want?
[01:14:51.454 --> 01:14:55.175]  This is the left-wing media's goal, and it's always been their goal.
[01:14:55.415 --> 01:15:01.878]  Their goal is to stop you from being able to say things that are going to fight to advance the cause of liberty, and this is how they do it.
[01:15:02.178 --> 01:15:05.539]  I mean, I read his statement, Trump's statement, in the Washington Post.
[01:15:05.859 --> 01:15:09.540]  I got to when CNN sent me the request for an on-air hit.
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.482]  I had to read the article twice, Alex, to figure out what they were talking about.
[01:15:13.922 --> 01:15:14.822]  I'm not making this up.
[01:15:14.882 --> 01:15:17.383]  I read through it, and I'm like, I don't understand where this thread is here.
[01:15:17.785 --> 01:15:18.625]  I had to email him.
[01:15:18.685 --> 01:15:21.626]  I'm like, all right, I'll appear on the show, but I don't get it.
[01:15:21.767 --> 01:15:22.607]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:15:22.667 --> 01:15:31.950]  It's this new thing where you got George Soros and these big foundations openly sending out provocateurs that are saying kill cops and burn down cities and that's okay.
[01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:33.971]  And then they're twisting something Trump's done.
[01:15:34.231 --> 01:15:35.852]  It shows a new level of deception.
[01:15:37.031 --> 01:15:45.296]  Right, you have BLM, the Black Lives Matter movement, calling for pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon, and then what do we want?
[01:15:45.356 --> 01:15:45.957]  Dead cops.
[01:15:46.237 --> 01:15:47.378]  When do we want them now?
[01:15:47.398 --> 01:15:52.701]  And yet the left is worried that Donald Trump said, hey, you know, Second Amendment people, you know, I don't know.
[01:15:53.121 --> 01:15:53.842]  I mean, that's the quote.
[01:15:53.862 --> 01:15:57.065]  If you're listening at home going, I don't understand what Bongino just said.
[01:15:57.145 --> 01:16:03.950]  And obviously, that's what they should all be talking about with Rolling Stone, The New York Times, calling for banning guns, time to quote repeal the Second Amendment.
[01:16:04.151 --> 01:16:06.713]  They should be talking about what the repercussions are going to be.
[01:16:06.973 --> 01:16:10.036]  Because, I mean, even if you're a Democrat, you should be asking yourself that.
[01:16:11.089 --> 01:16:16.956]  Yeah, and the one thing I will give Trump, and again, I'm not a Trump surrogate, you know, I appreciate that he tweeted some support.
[01:16:17.036 --> 01:16:21.861]  I could have used it after the Don Lemon interview where the left was, I mean, he should have seen the tweets I got.
[01:16:21.881 --> 01:16:26.306]  I'm sure you're used to them, but I'm not used to multiple, like, death threats in one night.
[01:16:26.567 --> 01:16:26.687]  Sure.
[01:16:26.707 --> 01:16:28.909]  One interview, okay, but I got, you know, it was pretty nasty.
[01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:30.732]  Yeah, 150 a minute, not good.
[01:16:31.736 --> 01:16:39.699]  Oh, I mean, my Twitter account just exploded, but I just need everybody to take away from this that this is a very coordinated effort by people on the left.
[01:16:39.999 --> 01:16:44.121]  You know what Fred Spiegel used to talk about in his book, Revolt Against the Masses?
[01:16:44.421 --> 01:16:49.843]  This iron triangle of the media, congressional committees, and left-wing activists.
[01:16:50.293 --> 01:16:54.394]  How left-wing activists push the media and congressional committees to advance issues.
[01:16:54.794 --> 01:16:57.375]  Make no mistake, that iron triangle is working together right now.
[01:16:57.395 --> 01:17:04.377]  Oh, you can see it's a talking point across the board, and they are coming after our most basic of rights.
[01:17:04.437 --> 01:17:16.721]  In fact, because you mentioned it, let's play a clip of Heston and then dovetail it with Joe Biden on the campaign trail, 2008, basically saying, if Obama comes after my gun, I'm going to stand up to him.
[01:17:16.741 --> 01:17:17.101]  Here's a clip.
[01:17:19.722 --> 01:17:22.163]  From my cold, dead hands.
[01:17:26.864 --> 01:17:32.445]  I guarantee you, Barack Obama ain't taking my shotguns, so don't buy that malarkey.
[01:17:32.465 --> 01:17:33.786]  Don't buy that malarkey.
[01:17:33.866 --> 01:17:35.726]  They're gonna start peddling that to you.
[01:17:36.526 --> 01:17:37.166]  I got two.
[01:17:37.186 --> 01:17:39.687]  If he tries to fool my Beretta, he's got a problem.
[01:17:40.267 --> 01:17:41.568]  I like that a little over and under.
[01:17:41.588 --> 01:17:42.868]  You know, I'm not bad with it.
[01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:51.442]  Can you imagine Mr. Bongino, Bongino.com, former Senior Secret Service agent, who quit because he couldn't be part of what he saw, but he's never told us what it is.
[01:17:52.022 --> 01:17:55.283]  I mean, imagine if Trump would have made that Joe Biden statement.
[01:17:56.623 --> 01:18:11.427]  Alex, I hate to say it, but if you said that you'd probably be in jail, I mean, seriously, if you were to use that exact Joe Biden quote and not change it a bit, you'd probably have, seriously, you would probably be in jail, because I know how these things work behind the scenes, how they investigate these threats.
[01:18:11.847 --> 01:18:31.080]  But again, because he's a liberal leftist, he's given a complete total pass because the implicit way to think, the way the media wants you to think is that the left is always innocent, they always have good intentions, and we should always defend them, and the right, everything they say is a call to violence, and you should have to defend why we shouldn't lock you up or investigate you.
[01:18:31.341 --> 01:18:38.185]  It's a complete paradigm shift, and it's very dangerous to the cause of liberty, and this is what really worries me about the future of the country.
[01:18:38.205 --> 01:18:38.886]  You know, we could have
[01:18:39.406 --> 01:18:41.267]  These are things that are not debatable.
[01:19:04.915 --> 01:19:07.598]  Dan Bongino, we've only got about five, six minutes left with you.
[01:19:07.718 --> 01:19:12.822]  I want to spend some time talking about what you're up to these days and where you see the campaign going in 2016 and more.
[01:19:12.883 --> 01:19:21.591]  But shifting gears, I know a couple times because you've called us or sent us an email asking, hey, did you say the other day that...
[01:19:22.151 --> 01:19:23.312]  I was your source for something?
[01:19:23.953 --> 01:19:25.454]  We've never said you've been our source.
[01:19:25.815 --> 01:19:28.777]  You've only said on air the things you say.
[01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:36.164]  You've never released any info other than saying it's worse than what people are saying, and that's what other Secret Service agents have said here on this show.
[01:19:36.865 --> 01:19:38.686]  But we know what's going on with Hillary.
[01:19:39.127 --> 01:19:42.330]  We know she was in a hospital for almost a year and had brain surgeries.
[01:19:42.370 --> 01:19:43.571]  They've kept it secret, but they admit it.
[01:19:43.991 --> 01:19:47.374]  We know she's deteriorating, and I went to Cleveland
[01:19:48.055 --> 01:19:50.576]  Well, when we got the Secret Service in trouble, I was blown away by it.
[01:19:50.596 --> 01:19:57.838]  I've been to a lot of, you know, major events over the years and had a few federal marshals or Secret Service say hi or say they liked the show.
[01:19:58.278 --> 01:19:59.918]  I mean, it was amazing.
[01:20:01.819 --> 01:20:03.239]  The crew witnessed it over and over again.
[01:20:03.259 --> 01:20:05.580]  The Secret Service, like, cheering us.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.240]  And I don't want to say that's unprofessional, but that's what was going on.
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:10.501]  And then we had some Secret Service folks
[01:20:11.181 --> 01:20:16.704]  Want to talk to us, and I pass it over to Biggs, and they said, well, just in about a month or so, you're going to get some info.
[01:20:16.744 --> 01:20:21.546]  Well, it came through the channels, non-digital, and it was just basically what you're saying about Hillary is true.
[01:20:21.886 --> 01:20:22.667]  We're really worried.
[01:20:22.707 --> 01:20:24.407]  We don't know how they think she's even going to make it.
[01:20:24.768 --> 01:20:28.049]  She's basically having seizures all the time.
[01:20:28.389 --> 01:20:30.810]  They've had to put in handicapped stuff to get her in the cars.
[01:20:31.971 --> 01:20:33.852]  There's a scuttlebutt about some big announcement.
[01:20:34.112 --> 01:20:37.594]  Now, obviously, this is the kind of stuff you can get people put in prison or killed.
[01:20:38.234 --> 01:20:47.004]  I just have a duty when real Secret Service agents, I mean you're there in Cleveland, this is going on, things are so bad behind the scenes that we've gotten to this point.
[01:20:47.244 --> 01:20:48.246]  What do you make of all this?
[01:20:49.517 --> 01:20:54.141]  Yeah, by the way, that meltdown by the Young Turks guy was just classic.
[01:20:54.181 --> 01:20:57.283]  That's some of the best video I've ever... I'm not kidding, man.
[01:20:57.323 --> 01:20:58.644]  I watched that thing three times.
[01:20:58.964 --> 01:21:01.927]  That was hysterical to watch these liberals lose their minds, you know?
[01:21:02.887 --> 01:21:03.928]  So good job on that one.
[01:21:03.948 --> 01:21:09.012]  Well, what happened there was... I mean, just briefly, their people set him up and told me to go up.
[01:21:09.052 --> 01:21:10.153]  He was okay with it at first.
[01:21:10.593 --> 01:21:14.356]  Then when he saw Roger Stone, that's when he blew up.
[01:21:14.376 --> 01:21:14.797]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:21:15.711 --> 01:21:17.492]  Yeah, yeah, that was good.
[01:21:17.512 --> 01:21:24.376]  No, and what I said, and I said this a while ago, this clip went viral too, that it's worse than you know, talking about the Obama administration from the inside.
[01:21:24.396 --> 01:21:25.757]  You know, I meant it.
[01:21:26.237 --> 01:21:35.682]  And what I mean to say, what I think you need to take away from this is, I don't think even the hardcore conservatives and liberty-based folks will understand the gravity of the fight we're fighting.
[01:21:36.463 --> 01:21:41.367]  Understand, really, the level of ranking competence going on in the White House.
[01:21:41.648 --> 01:21:42.268]  Now, I get it.
[01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:51.476]  I'm not saying they don't know what they're doing in regards to the implementation of Obamacare, so it was designed to fail, so that a third-party payer government runs the system.
[01:21:51.496 --> 01:21:51.877]  You're right.
[01:21:52.377 --> 01:21:53.438]  It was designed to fail.
[01:21:53.658 --> 01:22:02.506]  But what I'm saying is, I don't think you understand the amateur hour nature of the administration and how they can't even keep control of just basic things.
[01:22:02.566 --> 01:22:03.367]  In other words, yes,
[01:22:03.775 --> 01:22:06.576]  Your plan is always for bigger government and implement control.
[01:22:06.616 --> 01:22:09.098]  They've got a plan, but they're truly incompetent, which is frightening.
[01:22:09.118 --> 01:22:09.878]  Well, let me start on this.
[01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:15.881]  We're about to put people back in that stole the China that was George Washington's.
[01:22:15.941 --> 01:22:18.942]  I mean... Right, Alex, this is important.
[01:22:19.122 --> 01:22:33.489]  They're so incompetent, amateur hour, that even though they're ideological hard leftists who are implementing the exact plan you guys thought with Obamacare and taxes and everything, you know, the war on cash and all this stuff,
[01:22:33.809 --> 01:22:38.691]  They're so ignorant to what's going on that they can't even implement their failures effectively.
[01:22:38.831 --> 01:22:39.711]  And is that why?
[01:22:39.731 --> 01:22:49.454]  Because, I mean, I'll tell you, sir, I'm shocked, and obviously this is dangerous, I don't like it, but I have a duty when it's real to report it, and it wasn't any secret stuff or any documents, it was just, hey, yeah, you're on target, here's some info.
[01:22:50.375 --> 01:23:02.359]  What does it say about the incompetence inside the government, at the White House level, that the Secret Service is now at the point that they are so concerned about what's going on that information's being leaked?
[01:23:03.786 --> 01:23:05.606]  Yeah, I think a lot of people are upset.
[01:23:05.646 --> 01:23:10.688]  I mean, if you saw the book, Gary Byrne's book, you know, Gary was, you know, I get it, Alex.
[01:23:10.748 --> 01:23:13.508]  I mean, it's not my thing to do these tell-all books.
[01:23:14.028 --> 01:23:15.129]  I, you know, I don't understand.
[01:23:15.149 --> 01:23:16.089]  It's not my bag of chips.
[01:23:16.429 --> 01:23:18.410]  But I understand why people are doing it.
[01:23:18.450 --> 01:23:22.250]  I mean, a lot of people are starting to speak out because this is the calculus they're making, Alex.
[01:23:22.290 --> 01:23:23.711]  They're saying, all right, I get it.
[01:23:24.091 --> 01:23:26.451]  There's just a certain oath to keep quiet in the Secret Service.
[01:23:26.491 --> 01:23:28.452]  But isn't there an oath to save the country first?
[01:23:28.752 --> 01:23:31.695]  I mean, you're a federal agent who swore to uphold the Constitution.
[01:23:31.735 --> 01:23:34.038]  Will you uphold that oath and get your kids killed?
[01:23:34.098 --> 01:23:34.418]  Exactly.
[01:23:34.438 --> 01:23:44.610]  There's got to be some point at which, when you've got foreign actors, Chinese communists, admittedly... I mean, I've been told by former deputy directors of the CIA that Hillary is a Chinese spy.
[01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:50.036]  I mean, there's got to be some level where... I'm asking myself, what do I do, Dan?
[01:23:51.249 --> 01:23:55.133]  Well, I don't know if she's a Chinese spy or not, but I can tell you this.
[01:23:56.154 --> 01:23:58.216]  I doubt it, but I know her emails.
[01:23:58.376 --> 01:23:59.257]  I know for a fact.
[01:23:59.625 --> 01:24:02.627]  That her staff knew that that server had been hacked.
[01:24:03.047 --> 01:24:03.448]  I knew it.
[01:24:03.528 --> 01:24:15.316]  And whether she's doing it de facto and sharing information that didn't know, or did know, either way the gross, this is what I'm talking about, by the gross level of incompetence, they can't even implement a design failure.
[01:24:15.356 --> 01:24:21.620]  The White House, the White House-run Media Matters came out and attacked you when you were on six months ago and shed the hack.
[01:24:23.918 --> 01:24:25.319]  When they knew it had been hacked, exactly.
[01:24:25.359 --> 01:24:27.040]  They don't even want to plug the hacks.
[01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:33.282]  They don't want Secret Service telling, you know, how evil Hillary is, but they don't care if every foreign government in the world can just jump on her server.
[01:24:34.303 --> 01:24:36.344]  No, and this is the crazy thing about that attack.
[01:24:36.384 --> 01:24:44.207]  Like, I'm telling you on your show that the person who told me this is an unimpeachable, first-hand source who was there.
[01:24:44.547 --> 01:24:47.909]  Was literally there, like, physically at the scene when this happened.
[01:24:48.294 --> 01:24:54.697]  So you would think the left, Alex, to save the country would be like, oh my gosh, we've had a major hack of the Secretary of State.
[01:24:54.957 --> 01:24:56.097]  This could be a big deal.
[01:24:56.357 --> 01:24:57.318]  We should try to fix this.
[01:24:57.398 --> 01:25:00.059]  No, their only concern is, let's discredit the source.
[01:25:00.379 --> 01:25:05.401]  Who cares if they know about CIA operatives that oversee the Chinese or the Russians and people get killed?
[01:25:05.421 --> 01:25:09.143]  I mean, we already saw the, what was it, the scientist who was killed.
[01:25:09.243 --> 01:25:10.243]  So I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:25:10.263 --> 01:25:11.484]  These people don't care about the country.
[01:25:11.504 --> 01:25:12.584]  We've only got two minutes left.
[01:25:12.644 --> 01:25:16.306]  I know you've got to go, but seriously, go back because I was interrupting.
[01:25:18.226 --> 01:25:33.338]  I mean, at the point where the Secret Service was cheering me, I was almost embarrassed because... I mean, what does that say about the psychology in the government that they're so panicked that they're just happy to see little old Alex Jones as if there's some hope over there?
[01:25:33.598 --> 01:25:40.684]  I mean, that put responsibility on me that just blew my mind because, let me tell you, if Alex Jones is like some big shot at the Secret Service, we're in deep crap.
[01:25:42.071 --> 01:25:44.372]  I think people are really upset within the government.
[01:25:44.412 --> 01:25:52.474]  I think they feel like there's an elite class of bourgeois insider government officials that live by a completely different set of rules.
[01:25:52.534 --> 01:26:10.059]  I mean, whether it was the Kathleen Sebelius Hatch Act violation, Jim Clapper lying to Congress about spying on Americans, Hillary Clinton with the email server, and then you get rank and file men and women in the Secret Service, the FBI, and other government agencies that if they did the same thing would find themselves in bracelets and handcuffs
[01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:12.151]  And they feel like, you know, what the heck is this?
[01:26:12.211 --> 01:26:13.691]  I mean, I didn't sign up for this junk.
[01:26:13.991 --> 01:26:15.512]  And I think that's why you're seeing this.
[01:26:15.552 --> 01:26:17.872]  That's why you're seeing this effect on people on the inside.
[01:26:18.412 --> 01:26:22.234]  You know you've been betrayed and you know you're fundamentally hated by a criminal culture.
[01:26:22.274 --> 01:26:23.574]  It's like they run the country.
[01:26:24.054 --> 01:26:24.854]  They run it all.
[01:26:24.914 --> 01:26:29.576]  And it's the old story, I'm going to let you go, of Ron Silver when the Clintons first got in, the Hollywood actor and producer.
[01:26:30.999 --> 01:26:32.902]  Jets fly over and he goes, they're threatening us!
[01:26:33.003 --> 01:26:35.166]  And they go, no, those are our jets now.
[01:26:35.527 --> 01:26:37.791]  A lot of these people literally don't even get it.
[01:26:37.991 --> 01:26:41.136]  And I think that's why Hillary reportedly treats the Secret Service so bad.
[01:26:42.258 --> 01:26:43.661]  How did Obama treat the Secret Service?
[01:26:43.701 --> 01:26:44.161]  You can't say.
[01:26:45.365 --> 01:26:48.367]  No, I mean, listen, I never, he was always nice personally to me.
[01:26:48.427 --> 01:26:50.369]  I mean, but I always tell people none of that matters.
[01:26:50.449 --> 01:26:51.810]  I mean, I don't want to date the guy.
[01:26:52.150 --> 01:26:57.495]  You know, I want a guy who's going to be a liberty, respecting, constitution-loving president.
[01:26:57.655 --> 01:26:58.355]  And he's not.
[01:26:58.395 --> 01:26:59.176]  I mean, none of that matters.
[01:26:59.196 --> 01:27:00.397]  They were all nice guys.
[01:27:00.477 --> 01:27:02.398]  I mean, you know, but none of that really matters.
[01:27:02.418 --> 01:27:03.579]  So what's it say about Hillary then?
[01:27:03.639 --> 01:27:07.062]  What's it say about Hillary that universally people say she's super hateful?
[01:27:08.143 --> 01:27:10.625]  Yeah, I'm going to reserve comment on that one.
[01:27:10.665 --> 01:27:13.227]  My comment is my reserving my comment on that one.
[01:27:13.755 --> 01:27:14.996]  Alright, well thank you so much.
[01:27:15.036 --> 01:27:19.559]  Give us 60 seconds on what is going on in Bongino Land right now and Bongino.com.
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:22.001]  Yeah, the race is looking great.
[01:27:22.041 --> 01:27:24.482]  So anything, Alex, your audience is really passionate.
[01:27:24.502 --> 01:27:29.886]  I appreciate whenever I come on your show, we pick up a lot of Twitter followers and a lot of donations, so I appreciate it.
[01:27:29.966 --> 01:27:32.848]  I'm asking for... Sure, even mainstream media is saying you're probably going to win this one.
[01:27:32.868 --> 01:27:33.809]  How do we make sure that happens?
[01:27:34.029 --> 01:27:35.070]  Tell folks briefly about the race.
[01:27:36.161 --> 01:27:42.885]  Yeah, it's Florida 19, the Congressional District, Naples, Fort Myers, Lee, Collier County, those two areas there.
[01:27:42.925 --> 01:27:44.546]  So if you live down there, make sure you vote.
[01:27:44.886 --> 01:27:48.048]  And if you want to help us out, it's B-O-N-G-I-N-O dot com.
[01:27:48.128 --> 01:27:49.229]  I'd really appreciate it.
[01:27:49.249 --> 01:27:50.790]  Your audience is pretty passionate.
[01:27:50.970 --> 01:27:53.431]  And folks can follow you on Twitter as well.
[01:27:53.671 --> 01:27:56.273]  Thank you so much for spending time with us and for speaking to us.
[01:27:57.284 --> 01:27:57.945]  Yeah, man, you got it.
[01:27:58.065 --> 01:27:58.786]  Talk to you soon.
[01:27:58.806 --> 01:27:59.286]  There he goes.
[01:27:59.426 --> 01:28:03.250]  And again, you heard me bring up the Secret Service cheering us and all that.
[01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:05.232]  I don't say that to brag, okay?
[01:28:05.793 --> 01:28:06.534]  It's surreal.
[01:28:08.410 --> 01:28:08.610]  I don't
[01:28:30.143 --> 01:28:35.625]  Because they know what's going on, and then they listen to me, and that's just confirming everything I'm saying.
[01:28:35.985 --> 01:28:37.345]  It makes me feel sick, actually.
[01:28:37.365 --> 01:28:39.786]  I mean, this country is in deep trouble.
[01:28:40.086 --> 01:28:47.909]  But I guess the good news here is, folks are waking up, but the public is so soft.
[01:28:49.169 --> 01:28:55.071]  The public is so soft, and the bourgeois establishment elite is so disconnected.
[01:28:55.111 --> 01:28:58.392]  I mean, can you imagine a major globalist going to one of these
[01:29:01.158 --> 01:29:01.838]  Kane meetings.
[01:29:04.599 --> 01:29:05.940]  Her vice presidential running mate.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:10.441]  And they're meeting in... I'm not even going to say the state.
[01:29:11.221 --> 01:29:13.342]  And I was told I could say all this and I'm just not even going to say it.
[01:29:13.362 --> 01:29:16.203]  And it's all real.
[01:29:16.463 --> 01:29:18.384]  I mean, this is from real people, folks.
[01:29:18.924 --> 01:29:24.566]  What's happening is people are getting sick and tired of this and we're getting more and more and more and more and more.
[01:29:25.126 --> 01:29:30.428]  And quite frankly, this stuff is so crazy that... And I know it's true.
[01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:34.274]  It's just at a certain point, it's like, really?
[01:29:34.895 --> 01:29:35.235]  Really?
[01:29:35.315 --> 01:29:54.706]  We have these people running our government that are so crazy and arrogant that they're in front of rooms and in hangars and, you know, being shuffled into mansions, giggling and shooting their mouths off about how they're going to kill Donald Trump?
[01:29:57.569 --> 01:29:59.851]  I mean, this is just getting... I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:29:59.871 --> 01:30:02.552]  It's crazy.
[01:30:02.572 --> 01:30:06.315]  By not handling it... I mean, I just don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[01:30:11.181 --> 01:30:16.666]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[01:30:17.186 --> 01:30:25.094]  Unveil the Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula 30 Servings Fruit Punch Flavor Dietary Supplement.
[01:30:25.394 --> 01:30:26.455]  It is simply amazing.
[01:30:26.515 --> 01:30:27.456]  Infowarslife.com
[01:30:27.856 --> 01:30:30.119]  There's a million different products like this out there.
[01:30:30.739 --> 01:30:32.261]  They're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[01:30:32.781 --> 01:30:45.876]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy gross stuff.
[01:30:46.236 --> 01:30:47.477]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[01:30:47.497 --> 01:30:48.679]  I put it in my protein shake.
[01:30:49.279 --> 01:30:54.784]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[01:30:54.804 --> 01:30:57.827]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[01:30:57.867 --> 01:31:00.109]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[01:31:00.710 --> 01:31:06.855]  Some companies are going to take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[01:31:07.056 --> 01:31:10.018]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here, okay?
[01:31:10.038 --> 01:31:11.700]  Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:15.043]  There's some great stuff out there.
[01:31:15.183 --> 01:31:18.527]  And there's other powders I promote at Infowarshealth.com.
[01:31:18.567 --> 01:31:18.967]  They're excellent.
[01:31:19.688 --> 01:31:20.569]  There's some good stuff out there.
[01:31:20.729 --> 01:31:23.412]  This is just the very best we can bring you.
[01:31:23.432 --> 01:31:25.474]  And when you buy it, you support Infowars.
[01:31:25.734 --> 01:31:26.775]  You support the reporters.
[01:31:27.016 --> 01:31:27.777]  You support yourself.
[01:31:28.991 --> 01:31:37.095]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body.
[01:31:37.135 --> 01:31:48.622]  Because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[01:31:49.102 --> 01:31:49.702]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:31:49.742 --> 01:31:52.904]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[01:31:52.984 --> 01:31:54.245]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[01:31:54.265 --> 01:31:55.185]  Tell folks about that.
[01:31:55.245 --> 01:31:57.707]  A thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[01:31:58.547 --> 01:32:01.229]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[01:32:01.809 --> 01:32:08.174]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine, each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[01:32:08.594 --> 01:32:11.796]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[01:32:12.057 --> 01:32:13.337]  34 other ones you can check out.
[01:32:13.538 --> 01:32:15.379]  Go to infowarslife.com, the label's up there.
[01:32:15.899 --> 01:32:20.482]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can neurotically examine for yourself.
[01:32:21.563 --> 01:32:26.006]  By the way, look on the other side, too, because we're showing people the minerals and things.
[01:32:26.046 --> 01:32:27.907]  Let's look at the vitamins right there, Old Scott, in there.
[01:32:27.927 --> 01:32:28.587]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:32:28.667 --> 01:32:32.509]  Again, if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:35.511]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's that other source?
[01:32:35.531 --> 01:32:37.452]  I just show this to all the best sources.
[01:32:41.061 --> 01:32:41.461]  Retinol.
[01:32:41.481 --> 01:32:45.965]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[01:32:46.305 --> 01:32:46.705]  And you know what?
[01:32:46.785 --> 01:32:48.947]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[01:32:49.187 --> 01:32:49.767]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[01:32:49.787 --> 01:32:56.812]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[01:32:57.133 --> 01:33:02.677]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[01:33:03.177 --> 01:33:03.998]  So get them today.
[01:33:04.098 --> 01:33:06.139]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:33:25.212 --> 01:33:31.497]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.758 --> 01:33:33.699]  I mean, what do I do?
[01:33:33.759 --> 01:33:35.400]  Do I call the Secret Service?
[01:33:35.961 --> 01:33:36.822]  I've done that before.
[01:33:37.963 --> 01:33:38.683]  We had this guy.
[01:33:41.025 --> 01:33:44.348]  Oh gosh, it was about 15 years ago.
[01:33:44.528 --> 01:33:45.889]  Secret Service has got a file on it.
[01:33:45.909 --> 01:33:46.950]  It was in Tennessee Papers.
[01:33:48.542 --> 01:33:54.226]  This guy kept sending me letters saying, I'm going to kill George W. Bush, I'm going to kill him, I've got the guns, I've got the weapons, I'm going to kill you too.
[01:33:54.726 --> 01:33:56.707]  I know you're a devil worshipper, I know you're a Satanist.
[01:33:57.227 --> 01:33:58.909]  All these weird maps and crap.
[01:33:59.949 --> 01:34:09.655]  I called the Secret Service, I brought the information to them in North Austin, and they went to the guy's house and grabbed him, he confessed to it, they convicted him.
[01:34:10.796 --> 01:34:12.297]  I heard he got mental help or something.
[01:34:12.937 --> 01:34:15.499]  What do you do though when it's meetings with
[01:34:17.674 --> 01:34:22.398]  Hillary's VP candidate and world leaders talking about going after Trump.
[01:34:22.678 --> 01:34:25.980]  I mean, at a certain point, it's like, why do I have to do this?
[01:34:26.801 --> 01:34:28.843]  I mean, I've kind of really psychoanalyzed it at this point.
[01:34:30.144 --> 01:34:34.367]  I want the audience to understand, this stuff is over the top now.
[01:34:34.567 --> 01:34:36.228]  This isn't rhetoric, okay?
[01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:40.792]  It isn't rhetoric, I had the Secret Service cheering me all over Cleveland and the police and you name it.
[01:34:41.132 --> 01:34:42.253]  It isn't rhetoric.
[01:34:42.573 --> 01:34:44.755]  You heard Bongino, he wasn't disagreeing earlier.
[01:34:44.815 --> 01:34:45.575]  He knows it's true.
[01:34:45.956 --> 01:34:47.097]  He's told me off air.
[01:34:48.358 --> 01:34:49.079]  No secrets!
[01:34:49.879 --> 01:34:54.542]  But like, three years ago, how much the Secret Service loves me, and I'm like, oh yeah, right, the Secret Service.
[01:34:54.562 --> 01:35:03.608]  Because in my experience at RNCs and DNCs, they're like angry, shoving people around, trying to keep people from getting killed or whatever, just come off as kind of arrogant.
[01:35:04.109 --> 01:35:11.353]  Like when I had a point, or basically start to point an MP5 at me, HK, driving into the Hillary Obama meeting in 2008.
[01:35:13.328 --> 01:35:15.288]  And you're like, oh yeah, the Secret Service really allows me.
[01:35:15.428 --> 01:35:15.829]  Sure.
[01:35:15.989 --> 01:35:17.529]  And then you experience it.
[01:35:17.549 --> 01:35:19.569]  You're like, what twilight zone am I in?
[01:35:19.869 --> 01:35:29.011]  And then we've got, I mean, incredible Pentagon sources, incredible contractor sources, incredible, you name it.
[01:35:29.071 --> 01:35:37.413]  And it's just at a certain point, it's like, man, if I know all this, what do the other people in government know?
[01:35:37.573 --> 01:35:39.134]  I mean, these people are bad.
[01:35:39.394 --> 01:35:40.814]  And you heard what Bongino was saying.
[01:35:42.073 --> 01:35:43.234]  He said that's exactly it.
[01:35:43.394 --> 01:36:01.666]  Stealing the silverware and the plates that by the way were valued at millions of dollars because that's stuff George Washington signed his first executive orders to get money from Congress to pay for diplomatic dinners and to have the plates for people to eat on.
[01:36:03.988 --> 01:36:06.550]  Nobody eats on that unless like the Queen of England comes or something.
[01:36:07.403 --> 01:36:08.584]  That's the last time they got it out.
[01:36:08.784 --> 01:36:11.066]  That's back when Reagan sent that kind of message.
[01:36:11.807 --> 01:36:12.408]  He wasn't against it.
[01:36:12.428 --> 01:36:13.989]  He wanted us to say, hey, here's George Washington.
[01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:15.190]  You know, eat off what he ate off.
[01:36:15.250 --> 01:36:16.031]  It's just kind of interesting.
[01:36:16.291 --> 01:36:18.013]  I'm sure they thought it was really neat, too.
[01:36:18.173 --> 01:36:19.094]  It's that history to it.
[01:36:19.774 --> 01:36:21.596]  They just stole it at the end.
[01:36:22.076 --> 01:36:27.101]  They run the world, basically, and they're stealing silverware.
[01:36:28.362 --> 01:36:32.826]  And that's what I hear about them, is that, well, they had FBI agents that went public.
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:43.751]  Hillary would spend hours hanging crack pipes and Mao, um, ba-baubles, ornaments in a Christmas tree.
[01:36:45.778 --> 01:36:48.180]  And, like, the Secret Service and the FBI are like, these are crazy people.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:52.682]  I mean, even if you hate Christmas, why are you going to hang crack pipes in the tree?
[01:36:52.703 --> 01:36:54.263]  Because they're demons, folks.
[01:36:54.864 --> 01:36:58.066]  If you study criminology, this is what freaks are into!
[01:36:58.926 --> 01:36:59.927]  This is what they do!
[01:37:00.567 --> 01:37:05.370]  And you just can't believe that it's the First Lady, who really ran the White House, about to be back in.
[01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:07.252]  Go to DrudgeReport.com.
[01:37:08.252 --> 01:37:10.353]  She now sounds like Trump on trade, and
[01:37:14.781 --> 01:37:16.903]  Has now starts doing her hair like Trump.
[01:37:17.784 --> 01:37:18.224]  Look at this.
[01:37:19.125 --> 01:37:22.207]  Now she copies his hair and the media even understands it.
[01:37:24.349 --> 01:37:27.892]  Thanks a billion, Drudge Report has biggest month in 21-year history.
[01:37:28.093 --> 01:37:29.994]  I thought the mainstream media said he was dying.
[01:37:30.675 --> 01:37:31.496]  That he was just over.
[01:37:32.336 --> 01:37:35.039]  July 16th smashed all viewership records. 1,472,000,000.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:47.766]  220,000.
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:47.766]  And guess on the top 100 website list, InfoWars has moved up from 90-something to 80-something.
[01:37:47.806 --> 01:37:50.688]  I haven't even spent time looking at it, but I'm just looking at who's number one.
[01:37:51.569 --> 01:37:52.589]  But there you go.
[01:37:52.609 --> 01:38:00.916]  Imagine the top 100 websites, InfoWars, on another rating service that uses Google and others, is in the top, you know, 80.
[01:38:03.398 --> 01:38:06.020]  MSNBC's not even in the, you know, basically top 1,000.
[01:38:07.401 --> 01:38:09.523]  But they have Alexa and Bezo.
[01:38:11.314 --> 01:38:13.334]  Just saying we don't even exist.
[01:38:15.195 --> 01:38:17.095]  These people are a joke is what I'm saying.
[01:38:17.255 --> 01:38:18.736]  They're stealing silverware.
[01:38:19.776 --> 01:38:21.136]  Why are they ruling over us?
[01:38:22.496 --> 01:38:35.039]  Can you imagine going over to nice people's house for dinner and they get out nice cutlery and stuff and nice platters and things and you're like sticking silverware in your jacket?
[01:38:37.418 --> 01:38:45.784]  Maybe if you were poor and stupid and didn't know that you could have a chance in society to operate by trust, the most valuable thing you could have is your name.
[01:38:50.808 --> 01:38:52.469]  Even if you're starving to death, you could just ask for help.
[01:38:52.489 --> 01:38:53.069]  You don't need to steal it.
[01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:56.271]  But no, no, they've got all this money and all this power and they're stealing silverware.
[01:38:56.932 --> 01:38:59.594]  And you know, I'm kind of harping on that when I've got all this endless news to cover.
[01:39:01.693 --> 01:39:04.255]  Because it illustrates everything we're talking about.
[01:39:04.295 --> 01:39:05.475]  It's like a skeleton key.
[01:39:05.515 --> 01:39:07.716]  It opens every door into the minds of these people.
[01:39:09.437 --> 01:39:20.624]  Who would spend their time, if I was a decadent sociopath, I would spend my time, you know, watching football and having sex and eating the finest food and screwing around.
[01:39:22.148 --> 01:39:24.130]  I was a self-centered, dead nobody.
[01:39:24.491 --> 01:39:26.273]  And that's dead if you don't have passions and don't care.
[01:39:26.934 --> 01:39:28.015]  But see, they have passions!
[01:39:28.095 --> 01:39:39.629]  It's to desecrate crosses, desecrate Christmas trees, run around beating people up, running around being a horrible, nasty person, and treating little people like absolute crap.
[01:39:43.166 --> 01:39:48.410]  Hillary's the type of person, like when you see the movie Running Man, when the head of the network, a guy's mopping the floor and actually hits his feet.
[01:39:49.331 --> 01:39:50.092]  He goes, I'm sorry, sir.
[01:39:50.112 --> 01:39:50.812]  He goes, it's alright.
[01:39:50.852 --> 01:39:54.955]  He goes, if that guy's mopping the floors here tomorrow, you know, you'll be mopping them for a week.
[01:39:55.376 --> 01:39:56.357]  They fire the old guy.
[01:39:56.917 --> 01:39:58.318]  Hillary's really like that.
[01:39:58.618 --> 01:40:00.480]  She loves to hurt little people.
[01:40:05.390 --> 01:40:13.256]  She loves to call people that own a restaurant over and go, that waiter or that waitress, this is like well known, looked at me in the wrong way.
[01:40:13.276 --> 01:40:14.557]  And I'm going to tell you something right now.
[01:40:14.617 --> 01:40:15.418]  You get your manager.
[01:40:16.899 --> 01:40:17.859]  I'm going to have this checked.
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:22.183]  And if that person's working here in a week, you're going to have big problems.
[01:40:24.144 --> 01:40:27.685]  Just like she did that big laugh stop on the top places in LA.
[01:40:28.165 --> 01:40:33.527]  She had people actually call from the campaign and say, we're going to audit you, we're going to shut you down if you have any criticism of Hillary.
[01:40:33.547 --> 01:40:34.008]  Is that clear?
[01:40:34.388 --> 01:40:35.188]  Is that clear?
[01:40:35.208 --> 01:40:39.970]  Imagine how mad I make her.
[01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:43.571]  But her people are like, ma'am, you cannot order the hit of this guy.
[01:40:44.111 --> 01:40:45.372]  He's got too much attention on him.
[01:40:45.392 --> 01:40:46.392]  This will blow up in our face.
[01:40:47.193 --> 01:40:47.993]  You cannot do it.
[01:40:48.953 --> 01:40:50.994]  I'll guarantee you those conversations go on.
[01:40:54.463 --> 01:40:56.645]  I have experienced messages from the Clintons.
[01:40:57.206 --> 01:41:05.353]  I have experienced when the fists are coming down into my face in a parking lot, shut up about the Clintons, shut up about Waco.
[01:41:05.393 --> 01:41:07.915]  Of course, he only got about three or four words out.
[01:41:12.359 --> 01:41:15.082]  And I was spewing blood all over them, but it was, it was, it was fun!
[01:41:15.102 --> 01:41:15.162]  See?
[01:41:21.411 --> 01:41:26.832]  But see, the average person wants to sit there and grovel to this and give in to this.
[01:41:27.192 --> 01:41:29.793]  I'm not giving in to a disease hunchback demon.
[01:41:30.733 --> 01:41:34.174]  I mean, I want to know where the flying monkeys are with this lady, okay?
[01:41:35.574 --> 01:41:39.095]  Seriously, I expect flying monkeys to just come flying out from behind her at any moment.
[01:41:40.815 --> 01:41:43.076]  I mean, what happens if you dump water on her?
[01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:47.773]  Here's the deal, she can tell me that she's going to get me and my little dog too.
[01:41:48.473 --> 01:41:52.874]  I know she's going to get me and my little dog at the time of her choosing if I don't meet her on the field.
[01:41:55.235 --> 01:42:02.837]  Alright, I had so much news to cover today, I've basically only gotten to a thimble of it because I've just been rhetorically getting into what's happening in the state of the world.
[01:42:02.857 --> 01:42:04.237]  I'm going to get to it here in a moment.
[01:42:06.658 --> 01:42:11.179]  But that is bombshell to have Bongino not doubting that the Secret Service gave us info about her health.
[01:42:13.254 --> 01:42:14.114]  He just said they're desperate.
[01:42:14.154 --> 01:42:15.555]  They know the country's dying.
[01:42:16.835 --> 01:42:19.056]  Secret Service has never done that in its history, folks.
[01:42:25.198 --> 01:42:26.659]  It's because they know the country's gone.
[01:42:28.079 --> 01:42:32.341]  It can always rise again like the Phoenix, but we have to admit it's going on.
[01:42:32.421 --> 01:42:37.703]  We, the citizens, have to understand, and all the trendies,
[01:42:38.959 --> 01:42:43.722]  I think it's funny she ran the State Department out of her bathroom with a server.
[01:42:43.742 --> 01:42:48.625]  I think it's funny all these foreign governments got the whole spy networks and everything else.
[01:42:49.786 --> 01:42:51.947]  Do you idiots have any idea how dangerous that is?
[01:42:52.227 --> 01:42:53.008]  But they don't.
[01:42:53.088 --> 01:42:53.928]  They don't care.
[01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:59.072]  They've got little trendy outfits and they go eat at trendy restaurants and they're gastropods.
[01:42:59.592 --> 01:43:02.234]  And it's okay to be a gastropod.
[01:43:03.513 --> 01:43:06.095]  You just got to care sometimes about what's happening in the world.
[01:43:06.315 --> 01:43:09.238]  You've got to act like an adult, a serious person.
[01:43:13.722 --> 01:43:15.163]  All right, enough of that.
[01:43:17.025 --> 01:43:18.926]  I have not plugged once in an hour and 43 minutes.
[01:43:18.986 --> 01:43:20.027]  I've skipped multiple breaks.
[01:43:20.127 --> 01:43:20.808]  I am out of control.
[01:43:20.828 --> 01:43:22.990]  And I'm going to just leave it at this.
[01:43:23.590 --> 01:43:25.032]  I'm sending three or four people up to
[01:43:26.004 --> 01:43:27.425]  Wisconsin, Milwaukee right now.

[01:44:51.297 --> 01:45:02.423]  Musician Man 1981, or Music Man 1981, from Montrose, California said, Five stars, really like Living Defense, powerful stuff, I use it with Oxy-Powder, and EmpoweredLife.com.
[01:45:02.703 --> 01:45:04.885]  Deep cleanse and survival shield, and I feel great.

[01:45:12.789 --> 01:45:13.349]  Thank you, Alex.

[01:45:21.314 --> 01:45:22.795]  I really need your prayers more than anything.

[01:45:40.984 --> 01:45:43.786]  And we have the products that are the very best that we can develop.

[01:46:10.083 --> 01:46:14.105]  And it's not really a pre-sale because the DVDs are here and ready to ship.

[01:46:33.336 --> 01:46:37.118]  I mean, just the Police State, you know, documentaries alone.
[01:46:39.113 --> 01:46:43.216]  are so important for everybody's archives, especially with all the internet censorship they're trying to bring in and push.
[01:46:43.756 --> 01:46:57.846]  Now, it's more important than ever that we have hard copies, basically, of everything available and in our homes to be able to spread this information if things get even more serious down the road.
[01:46:58.706 --> 01:46:59.267]  It's amazing.
[01:47:01.568 --> 01:47:02.929]  And again, I want to thank you for your support.
[01:47:03.209 --> 01:47:05.531]  Okay, let's go ahead and start getting into some of these clips.
[01:47:06.011 --> 01:47:08.153]  Let's go to the Trump clips first and talk about those.
[01:47:11.107 --> 01:47:13.770]  Trump is now getting into her medical issues, testing the waters.
[01:47:13.810 --> 01:47:17.493]  He says Hillary is exhausted, taking weekends off.
[01:47:18.114 --> 01:47:26.942]  There was an article, I think it was The Hill, over the weekend, but I never got to, you guys print it, Hillary wouldn't be able to get back up was the headline.
[01:47:27.163 --> 01:47:27.843]  And it was her!
[01:47:28.851 --> 01:47:34.796]  Doing an interview talking about how I was so exhausted during the DNC that if I laid down I wouldn't be able to get back up.
[01:47:35.096 --> 01:47:35.937]  I'm so exhausted.
[01:47:35.957 --> 01:47:37.158]  I mean, this is what we're talking about.
[01:47:37.498 --> 01:47:39.020]  She clearly looks like hell.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:45.885]  And the inside info is having all sorts of different problems.
[01:47:47.427 --> 01:47:49.528]  They tell me check the back of the binder.
[01:47:49.568 --> 01:47:49.909]  Here it is.
[01:47:50.509 --> 01:47:53.592]  Hillary couldn't even get up after exhausting convention.
[01:47:53.652 --> 01:47:54.092]  Right, Barb?
[01:47:54.132 --> 01:47:57.075]  Then it links through to mainstream news articles where she's quoted.
[01:47:58.237 --> 01:48:01.239]  By the end of those two weeks, that's exactly how I felt.
[01:48:01.379 --> 01:48:07.883]  I was, oh my gosh, I don't know that I can get up, let alone what I will do if I am vertical.
[01:48:08.988 --> 01:48:18.354]  Well, in those two weeks, I knock on wood, and pretty luckily, because I have a lot of stamina and endurance, which is necessary in the kind of campaigning I'm engaged in, but I also try to eat right.
[01:48:18.374 --> 01:48:18.935]  It goes on to that.
[01:48:18.955 --> 01:48:22.918]  So they're trying to get you ready for the medical announcement that's coming.
[01:48:23.198 --> 01:48:29.182]  She was in a hospital off and on, six months straight, off and on for over a year, with all sorts of surgeries going on.
[01:48:29.522 --> 01:48:38.224]  Probably cancer, probably, you know, brain tumors is what Dr. Pachinic thinks, a lot of others, that then cause all the secondary problems and neurological issues.
[01:48:38.464 --> 01:48:40.125]  That's why she only does short press conferences.
[01:48:40.365 --> 01:48:41.765]  It's why she gives short speeches.
[01:48:42.025 --> 01:48:43.365]  It's why she can't stay during the debates.
[01:48:43.706 --> 01:48:49.407]  What is she gonna pull is the $64 trillion question to stay out of these three debates with Donald Trump.
[01:48:51.155 --> 01:48:56.478]  The media's tried to act like Trump is going to boycott these, like he's done one, and then they said he was afraid of debates.
[01:48:56.698 --> 01:48:57.738]  They had like 20-something.
[01:48:58.058 --> 01:48:59.259]  By the end, he just said no more.
[01:48:59.279 --> 01:49:01.220]  Not because he was afraid.
[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:02.861]  They were just total hit pieces.
[01:49:03.461 --> 01:49:04.362]  And he'd already dominated.
[01:49:05.282 --> 01:49:10.625]  But he's got to be in these debates, and I've been told he is going to be in them, but I don't see how she's going to sit there for hours.
[01:49:11.225 --> 01:49:12.446]  They're trying to make them shorter, I know.
[01:49:13.806 --> 01:49:25.974]  Uh, you know, when her, and nothing against people that are handicapped, but her diaper's filling up, you know, uh, and, um, you know, she needs to go change the diaper or take some tranquilizers or whatever are going on with her.
[01:49:26.914 --> 01:49:27.935]  That's what this comes down to.
[01:49:28.796 --> 01:49:35.080]  And that's why all the handlers are behind the scenes talking about false flags.
[01:49:37.722 --> 01:49:50.993]  To have an attempted assassination of Hillary that fails and then blame it on Trump and drum up anger and fervor so that it would be seen as tit-for-tat if something happened to Donald.
[01:49:55.317 --> 01:49:56.278]  Good Lord!
[01:49:58.300 --> 01:49:59.020]  And these people!
[01:50:00.481 --> 01:50:03.144]  Imagine if I know about this, the Secret Service does.
[01:50:04.093 --> 01:50:06.015]  That's another reason they're so freaked out, I would imagine.
[01:50:06.035 --> 01:50:06.956]  I mean, they've got to know.
[01:50:06.976 --> 01:50:11.200]  If I know about this, the Secret Service has to know about it.
[01:50:15.985 --> 01:50:20.329]  I guess we'll just have to talk to the folks that were there and told me to go to the Secret Service.
[01:50:20.389 --> 01:50:23.472]  I mean, you know, that's what's going on with this stuff.
[01:50:23.492 --> 01:50:25.014]  That's the level we've reached in this country.
[01:50:25.374 --> 01:50:26.836]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:50:28.055 --> 01:50:29.496]  I had trouble just sitting here.
[01:50:29.756 --> 01:50:30.517]  I say I can't handle it.
[01:50:30.597 --> 01:50:31.257]  I love my life.
[01:50:31.518 --> 01:50:32.478]  I would never commit suicide.
[01:50:32.498 --> 01:50:32.838]  I would never.
[01:50:33.699 --> 01:50:34.300]  I don't mean that.
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:40.864]  I mean, I can't handle just sitting up here and just daily life goes on and knowing all this.
[01:50:41.184 --> 01:50:42.505]  And I just want listeners to understand.
[01:50:45.067 --> 01:50:45.708]  This is not hype.
[01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:53.754]  This is not us trying to, I mean, see all the stuff we talk about that later comes out.
[01:50:54.514 --> 01:50:55.435]  And we say we have sources.
[01:50:55.475 --> 01:50:56.355]  We say things are coming out.
[01:50:56.395 --> 01:50:56.716]  They do.
[01:50:57.642 --> 01:50:58.223]  We really do.
[01:50:59.285 --> 01:51:04.073]  And so I'm just saying, you don't need to tune into an action-adventure movie to see all this stuff.
[01:51:04.373 --> 01:51:07.078]  You can tune in right here, and it's all being broken down.
[01:51:07.098 --> 01:51:08.440]  We're going to come back with a Trump clip.
[01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:08.800]  Stay with us.
[01:51:11.283 --> 01:51:12.704]  Article from Daily Mail.
[01:51:12.764 --> 01:51:14.526]  Too much TV lowers sperm count.
[01:51:14.746 --> 01:51:19.651]  Watching more than five hours a day of what I like to call the Satan Box lowers sperm count by 33%.
[01:51:20.552 --> 01:51:26.978]  Copenhagen University did a study with 1,200 healthy young men to see if the lazy lifestyle affected fertility.
[01:51:27.158 --> 01:51:33.404]  Binge watchers had 37 million per milliliter sperm count, while non-watchers had 52 million per milliliter sperm count.
[01:51:33.604 --> 01:51:40.827]  These Netflix and chillers without the chill also had lower levels of testosterone, which the body absolutely needs to produce sperm.
[01:51:41.147 --> 01:51:44.788]  Sitting at a computer, the study found, however, did not have the same effect.
[01:51:44.969 --> 01:51:53.432]  This article makes the point that those who binge watch may be neglecting their health through lack of exercise and healthy eating, both crucial for maximum fertility.
[01:51:53.652 --> 01:51:58.199]  Other studies have found other possible causes for decreasing male fertility over the past few decades.
[01:51:58.399 --> 01:52:02.005]  Junk food, poison drinking water, and BPA are among them.
[01:52:02.405 --> 01:52:04.809]  This is Gabe Goldiamond for InfoWars.com.
[01:52:05.089 --> 01:52:06.612]  More amazing reports to come!
[01:52:10.819 --> 01:52:12.200]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:13.761]  You can't survive without it.
[01:52:13.961 --> 01:52:14.861]  But where do you get it?
[01:52:15.161 --> 01:52:20.925]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:52:21.145 --> 01:52:26.868]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:52:27.068 --> 01:52:43.918]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:52:44.318 --> 01:52:46.440]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:48.001]  Stainless steel construction.
[01:52:48.281 --> 01:52:48.981]  Easy assembly.
[01:52:49.322 --> 01:52:49.942]  Low maintenance.
[01:52:50.222 --> 01:52:52.043]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[01:53:10.396 --> 01:53:16.558]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:53:16.939 --> 01:53:19.820]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:25.362]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:53:25.782 --> 01:53:31.744]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:53:31.884 --> 01:53:35.025]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:53:35.165 --> 01:53:36.606]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:53:36.826 --> 01:53:40.967]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:53:41.167 --> 01:53:44.028]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:53:44.108 --> 01:53:45.668]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:53:45.768 --> 01:53:48.949]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:53:49.249 --> 01:53:51.549]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:53:51.829 --> 01:53:52.789]  It's in powder form.
[01:53:52.889 --> 01:53:55.590]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:53:55.770 --> 01:53:56.790]  I take this.
[01:53:56.910 --> 01:53:58.170]  This is the product that I take.
[01:53:58.290 --> 01:54:00.271]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:54:01.091 --> 01:54:02.732]  We fight the Globals, we fight the New World Order.
[01:54:03.032 --> 01:54:07.954]  Secure your DNA force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:54:08.014 --> 01:54:15.436]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[01:54:15.496 --> 01:54:21.278]  Biden's giving a speech, CNN's covering it, the Clinton News Network.
[01:54:22.499 --> 01:54:25.460]  And the new slogan is, friends don't let friends vote Trump.
[01:54:28.159 --> 01:54:31.580]  Which I guess means vote early, vote often, or get your friends to go vote for Hillary.
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:37.141]  And I was looking at her, and she looks even worse than usual behind Biden.
[01:54:38.282 --> 01:54:41.262]  But of course, I'm sure she wasn't put behind Biden on purpose.
[01:54:41.282 --> 01:54:42.323]  I'm sure that was just an accident.
[01:54:42.563 --> 01:54:48.164]  Just like they put Mateen's father, the mass shooter at the Pulse nightclub, right behind her last week.
[01:54:49.484 --> 01:54:50.504]  Man, look at Hillary!
[01:54:50.585 --> 01:54:52.265]  She looks like hell!
[01:54:54.039 --> 01:54:55.500]  She doesn't look old, folks.
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:59.501]  She looks like she is deathly ill.
[01:55:05.984 --> 01:55:06.384]  Ah, man.
[01:55:06.664 --> 01:55:09.505]  Again, for radio listeners, we're streaming at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:10.345 --> 01:55:12.026]  Forward slash show, free feeds for everybody.
[01:55:12.046 --> 01:55:16.268]  All right, let me get to these clips because I was mentioning them.
[01:55:16.308 --> 01:55:16.588]  Trump.
[01:55:16.708 --> 01:55:19.389]  I'm told I'm going to win Erie and Lancelot.
[01:55:19.409 --> 01:55:20.069]  We'll go to that in a moment.
[01:55:20.129 --> 01:55:22.370]  First, Trump talks about exhausted Hillary.
[01:55:23.683 --> 01:55:25.044]  He's taking weekends off.
[01:55:25.084 --> 01:55:25.504]  Here it is.
[01:55:27.166 --> 01:55:31.409]  Hillary Clinton has supported tax increases on the middle class for her entire career.
[01:55:32.469 --> 01:55:36.832]  She's voted for higher taxes 235 times in the Senate.
[01:55:37.153 --> 01:55:38.113]  I thought it was more than that.
[01:55:38.133 --> 01:55:39.794]  That doesn't sound... Think of it.
[01:55:40.415 --> 01:55:42.556]  She's voted for tax increases.
[01:55:43.717 --> 01:55:46.219]  And by the way, she's proposing a big one today.
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:49.361]  In her speech, her teleprompter speech.
[01:55:50.322 --> 01:55:50.622]  She's got
[01:55:59.482 --> 01:56:00.943]  Her speeches are so short, though.
[01:56:01.564 --> 01:56:02.485]  They don't last long.
[01:56:02.525 --> 01:56:04.807]  You know, they're like, 10 minutes, let's get out of here.
[01:56:06.528 --> 01:56:07.969]  Go back home and go to sleep.
[01:56:10.391 --> 01:56:16.236]  Three days later, she gets up and she does another one and goes back home and goes to sleep.
[01:56:16.256 --> 01:56:20.920]  Oh boy, is ISIS hoping for her?
[01:56:22.762 --> 01:56:23.903]  Is China hoping?
[01:56:23.923 --> 01:56:25.304]  Can you imagine China?
[01:56:26.405 --> 01:56:26.926]  They come in.
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:30.242]  You haven't negotiated with the Chinese that tough.
[01:56:30.882 --> 01:56:31.483]  Inter-bedroom.
[01:56:32.744 --> 01:56:34.505]  You gotta hit them back with a lot of energy.
[01:56:36.607 --> 01:56:37.107]  That's right.
[01:56:37.908 --> 01:56:42.271]  And of course, you notice Trump was on the election and fraud and now he's on our health.
[01:56:42.311 --> 01:56:43.492]  Things are going very well.
[01:56:44.373 --> 01:56:45.754]  Drudge has been hammering this.
[01:56:45.814 --> 01:56:46.875]  They've been demonizing him.
[01:56:47.455 --> 01:56:48.716]  Because he's on target.
[01:56:49.537 --> 01:56:50.257]  We're on target.
[01:56:50.577 --> 01:56:51.378]  You're on target.
[01:56:51.478 --> 01:56:52.319]  Stay on target.
[01:56:54.141 --> 01:56:55.042]  Let's go to the other clip.
[01:56:55.102 --> 01:56:57.264]  Trump, I'm told I'm going to win Erie in a landslide.
[01:56:57.284 --> 01:56:58.245]  That's a big Democrat area.
[01:56:58.505 --> 01:56:59.766]  He's got internal polling, folks.
[01:57:01.047 --> 01:57:02.168]  He's way ahead all over.
[01:57:02.188 --> 01:57:04.951]  There's this huge hoax, though, that he's going to lose.
[01:57:06.793 --> 01:57:10.056]  And that's meant to actually create that perception, so he does.
[01:57:10.616 --> 01:57:13.659]  Or so when they steal it, people believe that he was really a loser.
[01:57:14.059 --> 01:57:14.960]  But Trump's not dumb.
[01:57:15.841 --> 01:57:18.163]  That's why they're looking into other ways to take him out right now.
[01:57:18.223 --> 01:57:18.824]  Let's go to that clip.
[01:57:19.767 --> 01:57:25.323]  So I was told this whole area is Democratic, meaning Democrat.
[01:57:28.243 --> 01:57:32.324]  And I was told that by a lot of different people outside.
[01:57:33.344 --> 01:57:38.966]  And then they said, I can't believe that you have 10,000 people, you have people outside trying to get in.
[01:57:39.906 --> 01:57:44.387]  They said, they came up to me, this happens to be a Democrat who I happen to know, he's a good guy.
[01:57:45.027 --> 01:57:47.168]  Came up to me and said, I've never seen anything like it.
[01:57:47.648 --> 01:57:49.968]  It always goes Democrat, is that a correct statement?
[01:57:49.988 --> 01:57:55.330]  She said, you are going to win Erie and the surrounding area, you're gonna win in a landslide.
[01:57:56.050 --> 01:57:56.630]  It's gonna be a landslide.
[01:57:57.799 --> 01:57:58.479]  That's right, he is.
[01:57:58.699 --> 01:58:04.540]  And that's why they are freaking out like chickens with their heads cut off running around dinosaur media.
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:10.562]  Oh, he's evil, he's horrible, he's a liar, he's a fraud, he wants a revolution, he's 20 points ahead, 30 points behind.
[01:58:10.582 --> 01:58:12.742]  See, he had a Freudian slip, he's 20 points ahead.
[01:58:12.922 --> 01:58:14.002]  He's 20 points behind.
[01:58:14.442 --> 01:58:23.124]  They are just lying and lying and lying and lying and lying and lying and then lying some more and then lying some more and then lying some more.
[01:58:24.682 --> 01:58:27.604]  Only the weakest-minded people are buying into it.
[01:58:29.585 --> 01:58:31.165]  The general public gets it now.
[01:58:31.205 --> 01:58:37.369]  They're like, you know, they told me Donald Trump was against gay people, but turned out he was an advocate for them.
[01:58:38.089 --> 01:58:40.090]  Which might be a problem for some evangelicals.
[01:58:40.290 --> 01:58:40.910]  I could see that.
[01:58:40.930 --> 01:58:44.352]  It's just that the stuff they say about him isn't true.
[01:58:45.293 --> 01:58:47.174]  By the way, he's not out to get Mexicans either.
[01:58:47.554 --> 01:58:49.455]  He just wants to kick felons out of the country.
[01:58:53.502 --> 01:58:57.627]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:00.570 --> 01:59:01.591]  BrainForce is here.
[01:59:02.112 --> 01:59:04.394]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:59:04.655 --> 01:59:12.483]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:59:13.260 --> 01:59:16.843]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[01:59:16.863 --> 01:59:19.185]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[01:59:19.565 --> 01:59:23.048]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:59:23.128 --> 01:59:26.250]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:59:26.750 --> 01:59:31.534]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[01:59:32.095 --> 01:59:33.936]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[01:59:34.276 --> 01:59:38.700]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:40.881]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[01:59:41.502 --> 01:59:42.963]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[01:59:43.103 --> 01:59:43.243]  Exactly.
[01:59:43.263 --> 01:59:47.206]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[01:59:47.666 --> 01:59:55.851]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:59:55.891 --> 01:59:58.773]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:22.091 --> 02:00:27.195]  He aligns himself with the truth, but it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:00:27.755 --> 02:00:30.537]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.017 --> 02:00:36.701]  Coming up, even mainstream media is breaking its silence on Hillary's bizarre behavior and clear health problems.
[02:00:37.862 --> 02:00:39.964]  Gary Haven's gonna be joining us, the billionaire.
[02:00:41.576 --> 02:00:45.700]  Entrepreneur, fellow Texan, patriot, guy that's been fighting the New World Order for a long time.
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:52.087]  He, of course, produced with Mike Norris the film, Amerageddon, and there is an exclusive release here.
[02:00:52.127 --> 02:00:56.331]  It'll be available here for a few weeks, and it's available in stores everywhere, Walmart, you name it.
[02:00:57.252 --> 02:00:57.732]  Amerageddon.
[02:00:58.672 --> 02:01:02.193]  And we'll start shipping these out by Friday or so.
[02:01:02.233 --> 02:01:03.293]  They're just now coming in.
[02:01:04.033 --> 02:01:08.114]  But if you want them exclusively, they're available at infowarestore.com.
[02:01:08.834 --> 02:01:19.597]  And I am so excited about the film that we have a special where you get two of my films free.
[02:01:21.107 --> 02:01:22.208]  When you get the film.
[02:01:22.868 --> 02:01:26.611]  Now, let's go to the shopping cart here on screen because we're so busy, I just edit everything on air.
[02:01:27.251 --> 02:01:31.134]  It says, Amerageddon 2 DVD Special with 2 free Alex Jones DVDs.
[02:01:31.994 --> 02:01:34.156]  Okay, there's no reviews there because we just started doing this today.
[02:01:34.716 --> 02:01:35.217]  That's great.
[02:01:35.277 --> 02:01:40.060]  That'd be a great deal at $39.95, but the thing I have here is, let's do this on air, hell, why not?
[02:01:40.620 --> 02:01:47.265]  When you buy 2 copies of Amerageddon, you get 2 Alex Jones films for free.
[02:01:49.244 --> 02:01:51.245]  That's four total DVDs for less than $20.
[02:01:51.305 --> 02:01:55.228]  Well, it doesn't say that on there, so I'm gonna find out exactly for you.
[02:01:55.248 --> 02:01:59.831]  But the point is, it supports these great filmmakers and the work they're doing.
[02:02:00.131 --> 02:02:01.812]  I'm so busy, I can't go fix it during a break.
[02:02:01.832 --> 02:02:02.633]  I just gotta do it on air now.
[02:02:03.153 --> 02:02:04.754]  That's how I work now, here on air, so.
[02:02:05.795 --> 02:02:08.157]  But the film is coming out.
[02:02:08.937 --> 02:02:18.400]  It's been in theaters and was very successful, and it's a really good way to introduce folks that aren't aware of the New World Order and how it operates, and it's very, very entertaining.
[02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:25.182]  And it's something that should be shown to schools, something that should be shown in churches, and so he's going to be joining us.
[02:02:25.682 --> 02:02:28.083]  I do have a lot of clips that are going to be coming up as well.
[02:02:28.723 --> 02:02:36.206]  Glenn Beck, I haven't even gotten to, because I should have covered the big top story in the country, ongoing craziness in Milwaukee.
[02:02:37.006 --> 02:02:39.689]  And I haven't really gotten to it because it's just total social engineering.
[02:02:39.709 --> 02:02:40.129]  But you know what?
[02:02:40.149 --> 02:02:40.870]  We have to look at it.
[02:02:40.890 --> 02:02:41.550]  We're going to get into that.
[02:02:42.151 --> 02:02:45.314]  And we're going to also get into Gary Johnson saying support the TPP.
[02:02:45.634 --> 02:02:49.798]  But I want to play this because Facebook and other places have been trying to censor this and block it.
[02:02:49.838 --> 02:02:52.540]  It's just a short 26 second meme.
[02:02:52.841 --> 02:02:56.944]  You can't be commander in chief if you laugh about dead U.S.
[02:02:57.165 --> 02:02:57.665]  soldiers.
[02:02:57.985 --> 02:02:58.386]  Here it is.
[02:02:59.568 --> 02:03:05.331]  As I say in my book, I made a mistake giving the Bush administration the authority that I voted for.
[02:03:05.351 --> 02:03:07.692]  It just shows you how hard it is to make these choices.
[02:03:07.792 --> 02:03:10.274]  Which is why I'm calling the book, Hard Choices.
[02:03:10.474 --> 02:03:12.955]  Which is why I'm calling the book, Hard Choices.
[02:03:13.055 --> 02:03:15.516]  Which is why I'm calling the book, Hard Choices.
[02:03:15.617 --> 02:03:18.098]  Which is why I'm calling the book, Hard Choices.
[02:03:18.178 --> 02:03:20.659]  Which is why I'm calling the book, Hard Choices.
[02:03:20.759 --> 02:03:22.820]  Which is why I'm calling the book, Hard Choices.
[02:03:24.521 --> 02:03:32.826]  You hear her hyena voice, and I apologize for that, from TV viewers, it's obviously showing, each second, another panel of dead U.S.
[02:03:32.846 --> 02:03:33.247]  soldiers.
[02:03:34.127 --> 02:03:38.290]  And she makes jokes about starting the Gaddafi war that was the cause of a failed state.
[02:03:38.890 --> 02:03:40.711]  That was designed to be a failed state.
[02:03:41.692 --> 02:03:45.294]  And that's what's coming out about the Clintons, and Rwanda, and other areas.
[02:03:45.714 --> 02:03:51.178]  These are plans to give you a failed state.
[02:03:52.398 --> 02:03:53.219]  This is what they do.
[02:03:55.709 --> 02:03:56.611]  Oh, it's a hyena.
[02:03:57.893 --> 02:03:59.496]  This was taken off TBS, too.
[02:04:02.061 --> 02:04:03.523]  You can't have Hillary criticized.
[02:04:05.747 --> 02:04:06.849]  Because that's not allowed.
[02:04:12.409 --> 02:04:21.752]  Now, we're going to come back from break, we're going to roll out of the intro, we're going to play the Amerigeddon trailer for folks, and we're going to talk to Mr. Haven, who also stars in the film, by the way.
[02:04:22.192 --> 02:04:24.273]  I'm not just saying this because he was the producer of it.
[02:04:24.993 --> 02:04:28.255]  I think he did just about the best job of acting in the film.
[02:04:29.595 --> 02:04:38.118]  Me, I had to play an evil senator, and so I'll be honest, I didn't practice my lines much beforehand because they were changing even the day I got them.
[02:04:38.878 --> 02:04:40.479]  But I did a pretty good job.
[02:04:41.883 --> 02:04:44.464]  But it's got a lot of famous actors in it too.
[02:04:44.504 --> 02:04:50.647]  And again, it's just all part of the genre of the Liberty Movement getting in to Hollywood films and countering them.
[02:04:50.687 --> 02:04:55.309]  A lot of Christian films and Patriot films now are bigger at the box office than Hollywood.
[02:04:55.329 --> 02:04:58.150]  So it's all part of taking the media back from the globalists.
[02:04:58.890 --> 02:05:05.973]  Gary Haben, Straight Ahead, the new American film by Mike Norris and Gary Haben, now exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:05:06.013 --> 02:05:07.434]  You get two of my films free when you get it.
[02:05:15.569 --> 02:05:23.011]  On July 30th, Alex Jones made a request that Donald Trump make rigged elections one of the central campaign issues.
[02:05:23.752 --> 02:05:29.093]  On August 1st, Donald Trump went on Sean Hannity and spoke with Sean about rigged elections.
[02:05:29.914 --> 02:05:36.356]  Vladimir Putin came out a few days later and spoke about how American elections have been rigged in the past.
[02:05:36.956 --> 02:05:38.557]  Here's a recap of those events.
[02:05:39.177 --> 02:05:42.238]  Mr. Trump, I'm not going to lay things out here that you don't already know.
[02:05:43.158 --> 02:05:56.090]  But I am going to ask you to seriously think about making the issue of Hillary's election fraud in the primaries one of the central issues to defeating her in November.
[02:05:56.430 --> 02:06:00.474]  And I'm telling you, November 8th, we better be careful because that election's gonna be rigged.
[02:06:00.614 --> 02:06:01.395]  First of all, it's rigged.
[02:06:01.935 --> 02:06:04.458]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[02:06:05.138 --> 02:06:08.922]  And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's gonna be taken away from us.
[02:06:09.082 --> 02:06:12.546]  America teaches everybody how to live in, quote, democracy.
[02:06:13.066 --> 02:06:13.527]  But what?
[02:06:13.927 --> 02:06:16.890]  You actually believe that they have democratic elections there?
[02:06:17.251 --> 02:06:25.459]  If Hillary steals the nomination, and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump, you have to say it must be thrown out.
[02:06:25.959 --> 02:06:34.644]  Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her from the very beginning by this Democratic Party.
[02:06:34.764 --> 02:06:35.684]  It has been rigged.
[02:06:35.744 --> 02:06:41.007]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public, contrary to popular belief.
[02:06:41.427 --> 02:06:42.888]  Then why are they holding the primaries?
[02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:45.101]  That's a very good question.
[02:06:45.241 --> 02:06:59.493]  It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly prefers Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously, and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and largely to facilitate that outcome, they are being done.
[02:06:59.613 --> 02:07:04.577]  When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[02:07:04.637 --> 02:07:05.418]  Actually, I think that's part of
[02:07:05.859 --> 02:07:09.586]  And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud.
[02:07:09.886 --> 02:07:10.748]  And guess what there is?
[02:07:11.009 --> 02:07:12.892]  She stole the nomination!
[02:07:13.133 --> 02:07:15.357]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[02:07:15.397 --> 02:07:15.898]  What does that mean?
[02:07:16.894 --> 02:07:18.734]  How would the party pick a new nominee?
[02:07:18.935 --> 02:07:19.855]  Today is the day!
[02:07:19.875 --> 02:07:23.456]  They're really thinking about maybe getting him off the top of the ticket.
[02:07:23.676 --> 02:07:26.376]  He now looks increasingly like the Kamikaze candidate.
[02:07:26.977 --> 02:07:29.857]  An implosion the likes of which I have never seen.
[02:07:29.877 --> 02:07:33.038]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[02:07:33.698 --> 02:07:44.381]  If Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country,
[02:07:46.164 --> 02:07:48.485]  Including in places like Texas.
[02:07:50.766 --> 02:07:51.367]  That's ridiculous.
[02:07:51.467 --> 02:07:52.467]  That doesn't make any sense.
[02:07:52.547 --> 02:07:54.428]  And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.
[02:07:55.128 --> 02:07:58.470]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars is now controlling the narrative.
[02:07:58.930 --> 02:08:04.473]  Go to InfoWars.com for more information and InfoWarsStore.com to support the fight for truth.
[02:08:14.008 --> 02:08:16.150]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:16.710 --> 02:08:21.835]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:30.768 --> 02:08:33.389]  The reason I'm here today is to encourage the U.S.
[02:08:33.449 --> 02:08:37.811]  Congress to take action to protect our country from its most imminent threat.
[02:08:38.711 --> 02:08:43.093]  Electricity would cease, the internet would go down, and the banking system.
[02:08:43.953 --> 02:08:48.095]  The smokescreen of national security used by government at every level.
[02:08:49.141 --> 02:08:51.984]  A strong America is the only thing standing in the way.
[02:08:52.204 --> 02:08:53.805]  Country only needs a little chaos.
[02:08:54.886 --> 02:08:58.369]  We have a fog that has descended on our entire nation.
[02:08:59.671 --> 02:09:01.052]  Hello, Mr. President.
[02:09:01.632 --> 02:09:02.974]  Now is the time.
[02:09:02.994 --> 02:09:06.737]  The average American family only has three days of food.
[02:09:07.238 --> 02:09:08.579]  We need to talk face-to-face.
[02:09:08.599 --> 02:09:09.500]  This is important.
[02:09:10.467 --> 02:09:11.168]  Sir, what's the mission?
[02:09:11.348 --> 02:09:13.309]  Disarm the population and restore order!
[02:09:13.329 --> 02:09:16.792]  Do you have any weapons inside your home or on your person?
[02:09:17.212 --> 02:09:23.176]  You had to give the president power to arrest any American by simply accusing them of terrorism.
[02:09:23.737 --> 02:09:26.278]  The vanity of nationalism will quickly fade.
[02:09:26.599 --> 02:09:29.821]  These are but the birth pangs of a new world order.
[02:09:30.942 --> 02:09:34.004]  I'm just so afraid of the world that you're gonna have to grow up.
[02:09:34.164 --> 02:09:39.208]  This is a time, man, woman, young or old, when folks run and hide.
[02:09:40.089 --> 02:09:41.973]  Or they pull up their bootstraps and they fight.
[02:09:44.777 --> 02:09:49.746]  When you sell your soul to one time thing, there's no going back.
[02:09:55.404 --> 02:09:56.826]  To come into studio.
[02:09:56.906 --> 02:10:00.811]  I've asked Gary Haven to come into studio anytime he wants to.
[02:10:00.831 --> 02:10:02.353]  He lives here in Austin part of the time.
[02:10:02.373 --> 02:10:03.695]  He also has a home in Australia.
[02:10:04.195 --> 02:10:11.625]  And of course, he's founded a bunch of different successful companies like Curves, which has been the biggest franchise in world history until he sold it years ago.
[02:10:12.686 --> 02:10:20.175]  And he has produced a film, Amerageddon, but the reason I've invited him here once a month is to get his commentary and analysis.
[02:10:20.756 --> 02:10:28.765]  It just so happens today we are launching a deal where you can exclusively, for the next few weeks until it's in Walmart and other stores,
[02:10:29.506 --> 02:10:33.828]  Get Amerigeddon exclusively at infowarestore.com.
[02:10:33.848 --> 02:10:35.669]  You get one copy for $19.95.
[02:10:35.869 --> 02:10:41.212]  You can get two copies for $39.90 and then get two of my films free.
[02:10:41.272 --> 02:10:50.417]  My first film, America Destroyed by Design, and then what I think is probably my best film overall in the state of the world, Fall of the Republic, from five years ago.
[02:10:50.437 --> 02:10:55.080]  But you watch it, it's more popular today than it was five years ago, six years ago, because it's all happening
[02:10:56.121 --> 02:10:57.342]  Because we have the globalist plan.
[02:10:57.462 --> 02:11:01.504]  I mean, so your film is fiction, but almost real world, near future.
[02:11:02.045 --> 02:11:04.266]  And it dovetails with my non-fiction films.
[02:11:05.187 --> 02:11:08.409]  And my first film is pretty darn informative and also pretty entertaining.
[02:11:08.729 --> 02:11:11.411]  You see me, you know, even a lot skinnier than I am now.
[02:11:12.311 --> 02:11:13.932]  But those are available right now.
[02:11:13.952 --> 02:11:16.512]  Amerageddonthemovie.com.
[02:11:16.572 --> 02:11:18.413]  You can also find out other details.
[02:11:18.433 --> 02:11:19.953]  It's still, I guess, been showing in some theaters.
[02:11:20.353 --> 02:11:21.394]  It had a good U.S.
[02:11:21.494 --> 02:11:27.175]  run, and now churches and other groups are getting set up to have viewings at their facilities.
[02:11:27.195 --> 02:11:30.956]  You can find out more, obviously, by going to Amerageddonthemovie.com.
[02:11:30.996 --> 02:11:34.697]  Others also talk about a TV series and a lot more.
[02:11:35.057 --> 02:11:36.838]  But again, if you go to Infowarsstore.com,
[02:11:37.947 --> 02:11:41.288]  You're funding our operation, and you're helping fund true independent film.
[02:11:41.328 --> 02:11:49.970]  I mean, this guy spent a lot of money, he brought in a lot of big actors, did a great job as a trailblazer to really fight back against the globalists.
[02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:55.891]  And so I'm very, very thankful for Mr. Haven for including me in the film, and just, we didn't even ask for this.
[02:11:56.591 --> 02:12:06.934]  Graciously, he has helped fund some of the operation a little bit as of late, made some donations that we didn't even ask for, and he's also, no, I'm not supposed to say that, but you're a really great guy.
[02:12:07.814 --> 02:12:08.336]  I think so.
[02:12:17.353 --> 02:12:18.434]  Is it a few weeks or how long is it?
[02:12:20.134 --> 02:12:20.795]  It's a week or so.
[02:12:20.975 --> 02:12:21.355]  Exactly.
[02:12:21.995 --> 02:12:24.516]  So it's available at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:12:24.536 --> 02:12:28.578]  We're very, very thankful for you doing that because that's a big deal and that helps fund what we're doing.
[02:12:28.678 --> 02:12:33.861]  And it's the listeners growing this community, growing this economic system.
[02:12:33.881 --> 02:12:42.905]  The globalists, if you study the Clinton Foundation and the lawsuit three years ago by Judicial Watch and the documents they got, and you're a businessman, I want to talk about this first.
[02:12:43.993 --> 02:12:53.996]  They say, in 1993, after they get in the White House, they say we cannot let Patriot, Christian, Conservative, even Alternative Liberal.
[02:12:54.696 --> 02:13:00.398]  We cannot let anything Alternative get a foothold, have their own publications, their own films, their own TV shows.
[02:13:00.738 --> 02:13:03.199]  We have to have the controlled press call them conspiracy theorists.
[02:13:03.459 --> 02:13:09.221]  We have to shut them down and stop them and call them profiteers, or we're going to lose the Info War.
[02:13:09.801 --> 02:13:12.923]  Now we have her before Congress as the Secretary of State saying we're losing the info war.
[02:13:13.343 --> 02:13:20.708]  So when people buy books, buy videos, give them to people, great way to get one, buy a second, get two films free, it's a war, folks.
[02:13:21.269 --> 02:13:24.411]  And they understand, they want to shut down this economy.
[02:13:24.851 --> 02:13:27.413]  They don't want us to build an alternative system.
[02:13:27.773 --> 02:13:31.556]  So voting with your dollars is one of the most devastating things you can do to the globalists.
[02:13:31.816 --> 02:13:32.917]  Mr. Haven, great to have you here with us.
[02:13:33.317 --> 02:13:33.798]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:13:34.019 --> 02:13:44.360]  That's my little intro rant, but as a businessman who's had thousands, tens of thousands of employees, started scores of companies, I mean how fundamental is it for us to understand we vote with our dollars?
[02:13:45.331 --> 02:13:50.235]  I appreciate that great introduction, and I appreciate the great work that you do here.
[02:13:51.056 --> 02:13:54.839]  You know, we have a window of opportunity to access truth.
[02:13:55.800 --> 02:14:05.989]  Before the internet, you had a completely controlled media, and so for a short window, we're actually able to listen to people like you and the great work you do.
[02:14:06.009 --> 02:14:08.271]  I mean, you've done some extraordinary things.
[02:14:09.571 --> 02:14:10.532]  Globalism's in trouble!
[02:14:10.552 --> 02:14:11.473]  Globalism's in trouble!
[02:14:11.853 --> 02:14:14.354]  Because of you and everybody, though!
[02:14:14.514 --> 02:14:15.015]  The listeners!
[02:14:15.035 --> 02:14:16.776]  The point is, look at Brexit!
[02:14:16.816 --> 02:14:17.376]  Look at UKIP!
[02:14:17.396 --> 02:14:19.497]  That's a tiny group kicking Goliath's butt!
[02:14:19.737 --> 02:14:19.957]  Yeah.
[02:14:20.578 --> 02:14:22.179]  Well, we have a movement going on right now.
[02:14:22.219 --> 02:14:35.366]  You know, Trump has initiated a movement in this country that exposes the globalists and their tremendous effort to take away our sovereignty as a country and our freedoms along with it.
[02:14:35.887 --> 02:14:37.928]  And that exposure now is waking people up.
[02:14:38.388 --> 02:14:48.678]  And it's not just UKIP in the UK, but you've got Le Pen in France, you've got the Podemos movement in Spain.
[02:14:49.258 --> 02:14:50.980]  People are waking up all over the world.
[02:14:51.020 --> 02:14:53.462]  Now the problem is it may be too little too late.
[02:14:53.943 --> 02:14:55.524]  So we have to take advantage of this.
[02:14:55.925 --> 02:14:58.667]  I agree, we've got to get prepared now.
[02:14:59.288 --> 02:15:02.151]  We may end up losing this battle before we win the war.
[02:15:02.811 --> 02:15:04.872]  And people have got to be bold about it.
[02:15:05.012 --> 02:15:07.574]  They've got to be willing to speak the truth to power to share this.
[02:15:07.934 --> 02:15:17.640]  No matter how much ridicule you're exposed to, you've got to start talking about this openly and not be afraid of somebody calling you a name or calling you a conspiracy theorist.
[02:15:18.420 --> 02:15:21.482]  And Alex, you're really a great leader of this movement.
[02:15:21.502 --> 02:15:22.802]  I'm so proud to be your friend.
[02:15:22.822 --> 02:15:23.483]  Oh, please stop it.
[02:15:23.903 --> 02:15:26.405]  And to be welcome on your program.
[02:15:27.025 --> 02:15:30.507]  The little bit I can contribute is so great.
[02:15:31.088 --> 02:15:35.251]  And as Alex said, our movie's available here exclusively.
[02:15:35.751 --> 02:15:39.674]  The number one complaint we've gotten on our movie is that it just wasn't available.
[02:15:40.734 --> 02:15:43.216]  We had a limited number of theaters we could play it in.
[02:15:43.756 --> 02:15:48.019]  And so those of you who have been waiting for this movie, now's the time to act.
[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:53.183]  Go to Infowars.com store and take advantage of this offer and be the first to have it.
[02:15:53.243 --> 02:15:58.387]  Buy two so you can get the bonus as well as have one to share at your church or with your friends.
[02:15:58.848 --> 02:15:59.849]  People need to know.
[02:16:00.549 --> 02:16:04.152]  And you know, the beauty of Amerigoodness is that we made a fact-based movie.
[02:16:04.412 --> 02:16:07.735]  Now, it may be dramatized so that it's entertaining.
[02:16:07.775 --> 02:16:12.960]  Well, I just appreciate the fact that you're the man in the arena and taking action and trailblazing just like our listeners are doing.
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.642]  This is our information warfare revolution!
[02:16:16.508 --> 02:16:17.469]  And you know, it's tempting.
[02:16:17.549 --> 02:16:25.052]  I've got resources and I can, you know, try to find a place to escape from this movement that's going on, but I chose not to do that.
[02:16:25.472 --> 02:16:31.015]  I chose instead to take my money and my time and my skills and bring the truth to people.
[02:16:31.155 --> 02:16:32.116]  And stick your neck out there.
[02:16:32.136 --> 02:16:33.016]  Because the truth is free.
[02:16:33.496 --> 02:16:37.958]  Yeah, but I tell you, you're, again, you're a great example for this.
[02:16:38.379 --> 02:16:44.262]  If you can do what you do every day, then people like me can stand up and do what we can do as well.
[02:16:44.482 --> 02:16:45.022]  And together,
[02:16:45.683 --> 02:16:47.324]  You know, you want to talk about stronger together.
[02:16:47.804 --> 02:16:50.706]  We are stronger together because we have the truth on our side.
[02:16:51.206 --> 02:16:55.788]  And what we're fighting for is our country and our freedom and our Constitution.
[02:16:56.328 --> 02:16:59.570]  And people are waking up and getting behind this movement.
[02:17:00.170 --> 02:17:04.573]  And so if you care about your country, if you care about your kids, join us in this fight.
[02:17:05.273 --> 02:17:06.594]  Take the truth to the people.
[02:17:06.974 --> 02:17:07.855]  Take it to the power.
[02:17:08.035 --> 02:17:15.060]  Because we have a chance, a window of opportunity right now, to take back our country that has literally been stolen from us.
[02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:18.302]  Now, here's an inside baseball point for folks, Gary.
[02:17:19.463 --> 02:17:22.445]  The Secret Service tells us that she's got all these medical problems.
[02:17:22.605 --> 02:17:24.387]  Unprecedented historical leak.
[02:17:24.867 --> 02:17:30.671]  I have a former head Secret Service agent on who ran Foreign Details, and he goes, no, I believe you got this leak.
[02:17:30.691 --> 02:17:31.532]  That's how upset they are.
[02:17:33.726 --> 02:17:35.207]  It's not fun to get a leak like this.
[02:17:35.247 --> 02:17:35.907]  It's dangerous.
[02:17:35.967 --> 02:17:37.048]  They come after leakers.
[02:17:37.088 --> 02:17:39.189]  They come after folks that put the leaks out.
[02:17:39.609 --> 02:17:48.714]  I predicted last night that there wouldn't be coverage of this for a few days at least because they've got to go to Hillary and others now and say, what do we do about this leak on Infowars?
[02:17:49.135 --> 02:17:50.835]  They're hoping nobody picks it up or covers it.
[02:17:51.196 --> 02:17:53.057]  Normally, mainstream media will attack us on anything.
[02:17:53.117 --> 02:17:54.858]  You know, a shoe I drop on the side of the road.
[02:17:55.478 --> 02:17:57.379]  But they're not touching it because they know it's real.
[02:17:57.839 --> 02:17:59.840]  They know she's got Parkinson's type disorder.
[02:18:00.060 --> 02:18:01.461]  They know she's having seizures all the time.
[02:18:01.681 --> 02:18:03.522]  They know she can't be out in public more than 10 minutes.
[02:18:03.902 --> 02:18:05.523]  They know this is happening.
[02:18:06.263 --> 02:18:08.384]  And they know that they're in panic mode right now.
[02:18:08.904 --> 02:18:11.726]  And so I just typed in Alex Jones again into Google News.
[02:18:12.086 --> 02:18:13.747]  Dozens of stories attacking me today.
[02:18:14.227 --> 02:18:17.388]  Nothing about us claiming that we had a Secret Service leak.
[02:18:18.149 --> 02:18:19.609]  Because imagine, I'm this big liar.
[02:18:19.630 --> 02:18:21.390]  I mean, why not just expose me?
[02:18:21.670 --> 02:18:23.271]  Why not send the Secret Service here?
[02:18:23.852 --> 02:18:24.272]  Why not?
[02:18:25.939 --> 02:18:29.340]  In fact, I've probably got to go to the Secret Service with other info we just got.
[02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:31.740]  Why not release Hillary's medical records?
[02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:33.601]  I mean, I'm getting ready to go to the FBI.
[02:18:33.741 --> 02:18:35.061]  I mean, what are they talking about?
[02:18:35.421 --> 02:18:38.062]  I mean, I want people to know what I know, okay?
[02:18:38.422 --> 02:18:49.645]  You know, the issue here is this country's in trouble, and what I'm getting at here is, Gary, imagine how screwed up things are behind the scenes if the Secret Service is willing to stick their neck out like this.
[02:18:49.845 --> 02:18:51.265]  That means they know there's nothing to lose.
[02:18:51.665 --> 02:18:51.865]  Yeah.
[02:18:52.685 --> 02:18:54.646]  You know, there's a few good men there.
[02:18:55.549 --> 02:19:03.198]  Men that are willing to protect their country and stand up and back up their oath to defend the Constitution.
[02:19:03.598 --> 02:19:07.403]  Thank God for them, and we want to encourage them to be brave and courageous.
[02:19:08.464 --> 02:19:16.153]  You know, as a Christian, it's hard to be glad that Hillary Clinton is so ill.
[02:19:16.801 --> 02:19:18.202]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:19:18.682 --> 02:19:21.743]  But I tell you, this is an evil person.
[02:19:22.003 --> 02:19:27.686]  This is a person who is responsible for the deaths of thousands of people.
[02:19:27.766 --> 02:19:31.807]  Hundreds of thousands of Christians in Libya and Syria alone and laughs about it like a demon.
[02:19:32.148 --> 02:19:32.608]  Like a harpy.
[02:19:33.268 --> 02:19:38.732]  And as a Christian, I'm so glad that God is God, and that we're going to see some justice on this thing.
[02:19:39.273 --> 02:19:49.441]  And, you know, for her to die, again, I feel guilty for saying this a little bit, but that's the best thing that could happen, particularly if it happens naturally.
[02:19:50.001 --> 02:19:52.923]  We don't wish harm on anybody, but this is a demon.
[02:19:53.043 --> 02:19:56.126]  I mean, we're not going to hurt her, but it is God's justice.
[02:19:56.386 --> 02:19:59.849]  It's like in the Bible, all the plagues would come on Pharaoh or Herod.
[02:19:59.869 --> 02:20:00.529]  I mean, you can see it.
[02:20:01.650 --> 02:20:08.232]  You know, I'm a little bit heartened by the fact that justice does come.
[02:20:08.812 --> 02:20:18.636]  It may come late and slow, but we don't deserve someone of her character and her history being put into power.
[02:20:18.656 --> 02:20:29.099]  And of course, the amazing thing is that half the American people still think it's a good idea that this person with her history, her character, might be the commander-in-chief of this country.
[02:20:29.479 --> 02:20:30.920]  So we've got to wake people up.
[02:20:31.380 --> 02:20:32.020]  I agree.
[02:20:32.500 --> 02:20:33.701]  I personally think that's skewed.
[02:20:33.721 --> 02:20:36.102]  I think it's more like 35%, but that's still a sickening number.
[02:20:37.002 --> 02:20:39.163]  But they make it like Coke, Pepsi, Ford, Chevy.
[02:20:39.863 --> 02:20:42.324]  Trump, like you said, is saying, this is a movement.
[02:20:43.004 --> 02:20:50.887]  And that's what I personally have said to Trump is, you are leading George Washington 2.0, and you're trailblazing, and your instincts are dead on.
[02:20:50.907 --> 02:20:54.228]  You don't need my advice, but I would hammer this election fraud.
[02:20:54.768 --> 02:20:55.888]  You know an internal polling.
[02:20:55.908 --> 02:20:56.769]  And he's like, yeah, that's true.
[02:20:56.949 --> 02:20:58.969]  We're ahead, but they're going to try to take it away from you.
[02:20:59.109 --> 02:21:00.310]  In fact, I told him, I said, watch.
[02:21:01.104 --> 02:21:03.745]  You're like 20-30 points ahead right now after that convention.
[02:21:03.785 --> 02:21:06.346]  They're going to come out with some giant fraud to reverse that.
[02:21:06.846 --> 02:21:08.666]  I would say next week, and it all started the next week.
[02:21:09.287 --> 02:21:10.127]  Okay?
[02:21:10.307 --> 02:21:12.428]  Because I sit here and I watch this stuff all day.
[02:21:12.468 --> 02:21:15.409]  I don't just act like I'm a political operative and an advisor.
[02:21:15.509 --> 02:21:15.929]  I live it.
[02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.969]  I've seen it.
[02:21:17.249 --> 02:21:19.050]  And then I went and looked at the methodology of the polls.
[02:21:19.830 --> 02:21:25.432]  Add 15% more Democrats in a bunch of different polls, not just Reuters, or sample
[02:21:26.812 --> 02:21:29.233]  30% independence, but no, those samples are really Democrats?
[02:21:29.793 --> 02:21:33.435]  I mean, they are pulling out the stops to create the self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:21:33.515 --> 02:21:40.457]  And when you talk about a movement here, Trump understands it's a movement to take down the New World Order.
[02:21:40.577 --> 02:21:41.537]  He is for real.
[02:21:42.057 --> 02:21:44.158]  And people say, oh, how do you know that?
[02:21:44.678 --> 02:21:49.720]  What he's doing is irrevocably damaging the New World Order, even if they steal it from him or kill him.
[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:51.821]  He is totally for real.
[02:21:51.921 --> 02:21:54.882]  And I can't get into all the stuff I know behind the scenes, but I'm here to tell you,
[02:21:56.212 --> 02:21:58.713]  Trump is on a suicide mission.
[02:21:58.813 --> 02:22:01.534]  And a suicide mission militarily doesn't mean you're always going to get killed.
[02:22:01.814 --> 02:22:02.374]  It means 50-50.
[02:22:03.254 --> 02:22:04.395]  He is committed.
[02:22:05.015 --> 02:22:07.316]  He went to Scotland for a month before he decided to do this.
[02:22:07.396 --> 02:22:08.816]  I was told this before it was ever in the news.
[02:22:09.316 --> 02:22:12.877]  And he decided that he can't stand seeing America screwed over.
[02:22:13.077 --> 02:22:14.178]  Doesn't mean he's not a tough businessman.
[02:22:14.398 --> 02:22:16.258]  Doesn't mean he doesn't stand up for himself and his family.
[02:22:16.518 --> 02:22:17.759]  But he's not out to get us.
[02:22:18.539 --> 02:22:19.199]  You're a smart guy.
[02:22:19.219 --> 02:22:21.561]  I have a lot of acumen.
[02:22:22.281 --> 02:22:25.743]  What does your gravitas, your spirit, gut level say about Donald Trump?
[02:22:26.063 --> 02:22:37.008]  I just see people attacking him and second-guessing him when he's the man totally bloody in the arena doing trailblazing things never before seen if you actually watch his speeches versus what they twist on the news.
[02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:39.790]  And all these Sunday morning or Monday morning quarterbacks
[02:22:40.310 --> 02:22:52.335]  That sit there and lecture him and buy into this make-believe thing with, you know, folks that watch these clips of him, like telling the strongman where he stumbled.
[02:22:52.655 --> 02:22:53.415]  It's such a joke.
[02:22:53.455 --> 02:22:55.096]  You wanted somebody to fight the New World Order.
[02:22:55.436 --> 02:22:56.977]  You wanted somebody to fight for sovereignty.
[02:22:57.197 --> 02:22:58.838]  You wanted somebody to fight for lower taxes.
[02:22:59.058 --> 02:23:00.758]  You wanted somebody to fight for the family.
[02:23:00.998 --> 02:23:03.339]  You wanted somebody that would stand up against the Communist Chinese.
[02:23:03.600 --> 02:23:06.801]  You wanted somebody that would take on political correctness and the horror media.
[02:23:07.081 --> 02:23:09.262]  This guy is a freaking wrecking ball!
[02:23:09.762 --> 02:23:12.325]  And if you don't get behind him, you get what you deserve.
[02:23:12.425 --> 02:23:15.970]  I think Trump is God giving us a last chance before we're judged.
[02:23:16.170 --> 02:23:16.690]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:23:19.934 --> 02:23:20.615]  You know, I agree.
[02:23:21.977 --> 02:23:22.978]  With a little caveat.
[02:23:23.739 --> 02:23:26.062]  I'm cautiously optimistic.
[02:23:27.088 --> 02:23:34.353]  And I almost got to meet with him last week, and I almost got to meet with him the week before, and I have some direct questions that I want to ask him.
[02:23:34.854 --> 02:23:35.434]  Well, say those.
[02:23:35.835 --> 02:23:39.497]  Well, choosing Pence was a really concerning thing.
[02:23:39.938 --> 02:23:52.847]  You know, Pence is a bought-and-paid-for, you know, he's a faux conservative, but he's bought-and-paid-for, he's part of the establishment, and to put him behind you really puts a target on your back.
[02:23:53.147 --> 02:23:55.009]  Now, I understand why he did it.
[02:23:55.529 --> 02:24:00.652]  He said that he needed to unite the party, and he also needed the funding that comes from the party.
[02:24:00.892 --> 02:24:02.072]  And he got it as soon as he picked him.
[02:24:02.313 --> 02:24:02.853]  Yep, yeah.
[02:24:02.973 --> 02:24:09.556]  I think he got $87 million last month, which is a huge benefit over it.
[02:24:10.097 --> 02:24:21.903]  But then he went and Paul Ryan and Senator McCain and that hag from the Northeast who has betrayed the Tea Party.
[02:24:25.126 --> 02:24:36.338]  Well, they ran a hoax saying he was going to step down and they were going to pull funding from him and just absolutely, they made the decision with Manafort to do it.
[02:24:37.819 --> 02:24:42.820]  And I mean, you still saw the Republican leadership all come out and say don't give him money now.
[02:24:42.860 --> 02:24:43.080]  Yeah.
[02:24:43.260 --> 02:24:48.762]  All I'm saying is, no matter if he makes a few moves like that, they're still out to get him because they know.
[02:24:48.942 --> 02:24:50.142]  Yeah, and you're right.
[02:24:50.502 --> 02:24:59.444]  At the end of the day... I'm not even saying compromise, it's just that look at how they came after him saying he was resigning when he wasn't.
[02:24:59.644 --> 02:25:02.365]  Yeah, the evidence... I'll tell you, there's people
[02:25:03.882 --> 02:25:05.664]  Well, they say actions speak louder than words.
[02:25:05.824 --> 02:25:06.605]  There's moles in there.
[02:25:06.866 --> 02:25:07.807]  I mean, you better believe it.
[02:25:07.827 --> 02:25:14.615]  Oh yeah, with probably the person who wrote the speech for his wife, for example, and pulled that off.
[02:25:14.796 --> 02:25:16.257]  Look, you can't even find the link.
[02:25:17.435 --> 02:25:25.540]  When he's out saying, join us, he's telling his people, we're going to organize exit polls, we're going to do all this, and they're like, no we're not, and they kind of think they know more than him.
[02:25:25.620 --> 02:25:29.022]  His problem is that he's got people in there that aren't doing what he says.
[02:25:29.542 --> 02:25:31.183]  It is tough, it's a big organization.
[02:25:31.623 --> 02:25:33.604]  I'm not giving you cover, I know what's going on.
[02:25:34.285 --> 02:25:35.525]  I mean, I have to stop right there.
[02:25:35.946 --> 02:25:36.486]  I know.
[02:25:37.711 --> 02:25:42.112]  And of course I'm a observer, although I have ties into the campaign right now.
[02:25:43.032 --> 02:25:44.673]  But Alex, I'm with you on this thing.
[02:25:46.653 --> 02:25:54.275]  He is obviously, if you judge people by their actions and not their words, he is obviously standing against this globalism.
[02:25:54.815 --> 02:25:58.136]  And for people to, let me kind of put it into real simplistic terms.
[02:25:58.796 --> 02:26:02.580]  There's a movement for globalism and there's a movement for nationalism.
[02:26:02.980 --> 02:26:09.366]  Nationalists believe in American sovereignty, the Constitution, the culture in America.
[02:26:09.606 --> 02:26:14.651]  The globalists believe that you need to diminish the American Constitution and sovereignty.
[02:26:15.231 --> 02:26:19.533]  So that we will be weakened to accept a global government.
[02:26:19.953 --> 02:26:24.275]  You know, that used to be called conspiracy, but it is out there every day now.
[02:26:24.335 --> 02:26:31.277]  The Financial Times, they all admit, this is our system, and we're going to bring 5 million radical Muslims in, because Europe's too white.
[02:26:31.438 --> 02:26:34.959]  It's anti-Christian, it's sick, it's evil.
[02:26:35.319 --> 02:26:36.920]  And they admit this is their world government plan.
[02:26:37.580 --> 02:26:40.761]  And again, under world government, some TPP is ruling over you.
[02:26:40.941 --> 02:26:42.102]  I mean, why would anyone be for this?
[02:26:42.962 --> 02:26:44.243]  Yeah, and so we have a movement right now.
[02:26:44.263 --> 02:26:46.404]  So it's national sovereignty versus world dictatorship?
[02:26:46.624 --> 02:26:46.844]  Yes.
[02:26:47.285 --> 02:26:48.605]  And people need to understand that.
[02:26:49.006 --> 02:26:52.187]  And here's the problem with world dictatorship, or this global government.
[02:26:52.468 --> 02:26:53.928]  They're creating chaos.
[02:26:53.989 --> 02:26:56.770]  They're bringing us right up to World War III.
[02:26:57.290 --> 02:27:00.672]  And they're going to claim that globalism is going to solve all these problems.
[02:27:00.692 --> 02:27:02.173]  They're going to make it look palatable.
[02:27:02.573 --> 02:27:07.536]  And so, now's the chance for us to teach people that these globalists are Satanists.
[02:27:07.636 --> 02:27:08.477]  They're Illuminati.
[02:27:08.557 --> 02:27:11.879]  And Kissinger said, we're going to cause world war to bring us under world government.
[02:27:12.359 --> 02:27:17.364]  And Kissinger also said that the only thing standing in the way of global government is a strong America.
[02:27:17.644 --> 02:27:19.566]  And that means they've got to diminish us.
[02:27:19.987 --> 02:27:20.988]  And they're well on their way to do that.
[02:27:21.008 --> 02:27:23.090]  Because the American system competed with their garbage.
[02:27:23.450 --> 02:27:23.610]  Yep.
[02:27:23.911 --> 02:27:27.194]  Open borders, bringing in unvetted... Other countries wanting to be like us?
[02:27:27.815 --> 02:27:30.357]  Well that messes up your world government of a bunch of poor people.
[02:27:30.638 --> 02:27:30.738]  Yep.
[02:27:31.258 --> 02:27:32.079]  We're all going to be poor.
[02:27:32.700 --> 02:27:39.067]  Margaret Thatcher said that with socialism we all share poverty.
[02:27:39.588 --> 02:27:41.230]  And that's where these people are heading.
[02:27:41.690 --> 02:27:46.436]  And it's extraordinary that they've gotten this far before we as a people have caught on.
[02:27:46.696 --> 02:27:47.537]  But we're awake now.
[02:27:47.897 --> 02:27:49.719]  And again, it's partly because of Trump.
[02:27:50.139 --> 02:27:52.442]  Well, I want you to meet with Trump, because you have a lot of discernment.
[02:27:52.722 --> 02:27:56.586]  You early on said, I mean, like a year before, it was like, oh, Cruz, bad news.
[02:27:56.626 --> 02:27:57.667]  I met with him, really.
[02:27:57.787 --> 02:27:59.168]  And you kind of got into it with me.
[02:27:59.949 --> 02:28:01.470]  As I was all, Cruz, Cruz, Cruz, Cruz.
[02:28:01.670 --> 02:28:02.952]  I wasn't even for Trump at that point.
[02:28:03.592 --> 02:28:04.933]  And this was really early on.
[02:28:06.155 --> 02:28:07.316]  And then you warned me about it.
[02:28:07.376 --> 02:28:09.398]  But I mean, Trump overall,
[02:28:10.816 --> 02:28:12.819]  Look, I know he's going up against the new world order.
[02:28:13.159 --> 02:28:17.846]  There's no way he's saying all this and then, you know, secretly with them.
[02:28:18.386 --> 02:28:22.772]  I am worried that nobody understands all the angles and I think sometimes
[02:28:24.167 --> 02:28:44.920]  I think the people closest to him that have been in New York all their lives and places, I think inherently think all these liberals and intelligentsia are their friends, and whereas Trump doesn't care what other people think as long as he knows he's right, I quite frankly think some people closest to him, that peer pressure gets to him, and I know his family's wonderful and they're great, but I think some of the folks in there are the biggest issue.
[02:28:46.021 --> 02:28:58.050]  You know, I was with a pastor friend of mine last night, and he pointed, who by the way has got a meeting with Trump, so we were discussing it, and Trump got into a battle with the Pope!
[02:28:59.122 --> 02:29:02.143]  And the Pope said he was not a Christian.
[02:29:02.223 --> 02:29:05.224]  Trump was not a Christian because he was going to build a wall on the border.
[02:29:05.765 --> 02:29:09.666]  And Trump told the Pope that, damn it, he was a Christian.
[02:29:10.806 --> 02:29:12.067]  And who was he to tell him he wasn't?
[02:29:12.367 --> 02:29:13.467]  So, think about that.
[02:29:13.988 --> 02:29:18.749]  Donald Trump even got into an argument with the Pope over his Christianity.
[02:29:18.769 --> 02:29:21.290]  Plus, he also tweeted out his 100 plus foot walls.
[02:29:21.570 --> 02:29:21.770]  Yeah.
[02:29:21.831 --> 02:29:22.731]  Said, what are these, Popey?
[02:29:24.454 --> 02:29:25.495]  Yeah, I've been to the Vatican.
[02:29:25.515 --> 02:29:26.735]  There's some pretty tall walls there.
[02:29:27.716 --> 02:29:28.336]  It's amazing.
[02:29:29.497 --> 02:29:30.237]  Alex, I'm with you.
[02:29:31.017 --> 02:29:32.238]  Trump is our only hope.
[02:29:32.938 --> 02:29:35.099]  And we have got to get behind him and support him.
[02:29:35.299 --> 02:29:38.681]  And nobody's perfect, especially with the delivery of this whole thing.
[02:29:39.641 --> 02:29:40.682]  But we've got to support him.
[02:29:41.142 --> 02:29:44.004]  Right now, it's the only horse we've got in this race.
[02:29:44.984 --> 02:29:45.424]  Absolutely.
[02:29:45.444 --> 02:29:47.525]  And he goes out and gives two-hour speeches and they snip him up.
[02:29:47.545 --> 02:29:48.866]  That's what his folks get mad at him about.
[02:29:49.406 --> 02:29:52.108]  But that's what's enduring is that he's saying what he really believes.
[02:29:52.408 --> 02:30:00.212]  Now he's pretty much on point, but I want to talk more about the film when we come back and get into where you see the future going if Trump loses.
[02:30:00.232 --> 02:30:01.053]  We're on the march.
[02:30:01.513 --> 02:30:03.134]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:04.054 --> 02:30:06.736]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:11.423 --> 02:30:17.588]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:30:17.968 --> 02:30:20.871]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:30:21.191 --> 02:30:26.395]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:30:26.815 --> 02:30:32.780]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:30:32.940 --> 02:30:36.063]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:30:36.223 --> 02:30:37.664]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[02:30:37.864 --> 02:30:42.005]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:30:42.205 --> 02:30:45.066]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:30:45.146 --> 02:30:46.706]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:30:46.806 --> 02:30:49.987]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:30:50.267 --> 02:30:52.587]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:30:52.867 --> 02:30:53.827]  It's in powder form.
[02:30:53.927 --> 02:30:56.628]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:30:56.808 --> 02:30:57.408]  I take this.
[02:30:57.528 --> 02:30:59.208]  This is the product that I take.
[02:30:59.328 --> 02:31:01.309]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[02:31:02.129 --> 02:31:02.890]  We fight the Globals.
[02:31:02.930 --> 02:31:03.771]  We fight the New World Order.

[02:31:11.880 --> 02:31:13.281]  Article from Daily Mail.
[02:31:13.361 --> 02:31:15.143]  Too much TV lowers sperm count.
[02:31:15.343 --> 02:31:20.247]  Watching more than five hours a day of what I like to call the Satan Box lowers sperm count by 33%.
[02:31:21.148 --> 02:31:27.553]  Copenhagen University did a study with 1,200 healthy young men to see if the lazy lifestyle affected fertility.
[02:31:27.733 --> 02:31:33.998]  Binge watchers had 37 million per milliliter sperm count, while non-watchers had 52 million per milliliter sperm count.
[02:31:34.178 --> 02:31:41.426]  These Netflix and chillers without the chill also had lower levels of testosterone, which the body absolutely needs to produce sperm.
[02:31:41.727 --> 02:31:45.391]  Sitting at a computer, the study found, however, did not have the same effect.
[02:31:45.571 --> 02:31:54.021]  This article makes the point that those who binge watch may be neglecting their health through lack of exercise and healthy eating, both crucial for maximum fertility.
[02:31:54.241 --> 02:31:58.745]  Other studies have found other possible causes for decreasing male fertility over the past few decades.
[02:31:58.985 --> 02:32:02.588]  Junk food, poison drinking water, and BPA are among them.
[02:32:02.988 --> 02:32:05.370]  This is Gabe Goldiamond for InfoWars.com.
[02:32:05.671 --> 02:32:07.192]  More amazing reports to come!
[02:32:11.377 --> 02:32:20.405]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:32:20.485 --> 02:32:28.592]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:32:28.872 --> 02:32:33.573]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:32:33.753 --> 02:32:40.435]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:40.535 --> 02:32:47.617]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:32:47.717 --> 02:32:49.437]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[02:32:49.617 --> 02:32:54.581]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:32:54.742 --> 02:32:59.085]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:32:59.225 --> 02:33:02.488]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:33:02.628 --> 02:33:08.754]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:33:08.914 --> 02:33:10.615]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:33:21.289 --> 02:33:22.870]  He never gives up.
[02:33:23.251 --> 02:33:29.295]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide.
[02:33:29.315 --> 02:33:34.919]  Well, the American people never give up and never give in.
[02:33:34.959 --> 02:33:37.681]  Those that are awake, that's the real stars of this fight.
[02:33:37.922 --> 02:33:39.002]  Gary Haven's our guest.
[02:33:39.683 --> 02:33:40.544]  We have Amerageddon.
[02:33:41.676 --> 02:33:45.139]  The film exclusively for the next week or so before it's in stores across the country.
[02:33:45.359 --> 02:33:47.121]  We'll continue to sell it, obviously, a film I'm in.
[02:33:47.141 --> 02:33:55.889]  You get two copies for $39.90 and get two of my films, Fall of the Republic and America's Robot Design, free with that.
[02:33:55.969 --> 02:34:02.475]  So get one film for yourself and one for others and then two other films to watch or then give to others or keep as an archive.
[02:34:03.717 --> 02:34:12.600]  Or you can get one copy of America in the Movie for $19.95 at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:34:12.620 --> 02:34:15.381]  Gary Haven is our guest here in studio.
[02:34:15.421 --> 02:34:25.305]  And boy, I was saying when we were coming back, I wanted to get into the fact that we have the situation all over the country.
[02:34:26.451 --> 02:34:32.293]  Where big foundations, the White House, is trying to foment racial division.
[02:34:32.433 --> 02:34:46.058]  And I was asking your view on that, and you made a really, really great point about something that I only saw in the news one time, and it hardly got any coverage, but that we've confirmed is happening all over the country.
[02:34:46.399 --> 02:34:49.280]  So before we go to some of these clips, Gary, talk about your personal experiences.
[02:34:50.980 --> 02:34:53.361]  We, particularly as Christians, need to understand that
[02:34:55.734 --> 02:35:00.318]  The elite need to create chaos in order for them to bring in their solution.
[02:35:10.908 --> 02:35:12.049]  I was in Shreveport, Louisiana the other day.
[02:35:37.071 --> 02:35:37.231]  Yes.
[02:36:07.592 --> 02:36:12.077]  I read about that in some cities on alternative sites, but never on the national news.
[02:36:12.137 --> 02:36:13.619]  That's not the image they want.
[02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:19.126]  They want the image of black people running around saying kill white people.
[02:36:20.248 --> 02:36:22.329]  As if that sells equality.
[02:36:22.390 --> 02:36:25.572]  No, that actually creates racism against black people on the other side.
[02:36:26.312 --> 02:36:28.053]  And it's, again, from the Democrats and the globalists.
[02:36:28.073 --> 02:36:30.155]  What a sick, nasty thing to do.
[02:36:30.915 --> 02:36:39.361]  Just like Soros installed, as you know, literal Nazis in Ukraine, unelected, and our media called it a great thing.
[02:36:39.381 --> 02:36:41.642]  I mean, you talk about pushing evil, they do it.
[02:36:41.662 --> 02:36:47.386]  Now, I have a bunch of these clips, but notice what you said is, we should all come together and see this as a manipulation.
[02:36:47.726 --> 02:36:49.748]  Glenn Beck now is the apologist
[02:36:50.908 --> 02:36:51.208]  Four.
[02:36:51.288 --> 02:36:53.449]  And I'm not attacking him because of who he is or whatever.
[02:36:53.469 --> 02:36:57.230]  I'm just doing it because people need to know and understand who he is and why he's doing this.
[02:36:57.710 --> 02:37:00.271]  He comes out and says, I'm going to have to vote basically for Hillary.
[02:37:00.311 --> 02:37:01.771]  You know, anybody but Trump.
[02:37:02.191 --> 02:37:05.352]  He comes out now and says, I understand Black Lives Matter.
[02:37:05.892 --> 02:37:06.593]  I understand them.
[02:37:06.633 --> 02:37:11.674]  It gives legitimacy to a group that is evil and meant to misrepresent
[02:37:12.796 --> 02:37:13.957]  What's really happening.
[02:37:13.977 --> 02:37:19.501]  I want to play a clip of that in just a moment because he's now the apologist for conservatives.
[02:37:19.941 --> 02:37:27.526]  He now, but not the real apologist, he goes in as the straw man and says, I know Republicans are racist and bad and which isn't true on average.
[02:37:27.947 --> 02:37:30.388]  And so I'm here to say I'm the good Republican.
[02:37:31.049 --> 02:37:33.711]  And it is so ridiculously transparent.
[02:37:34.111 --> 02:37:39.395]  And he's now running around everywhere saying and telling his listeners, don't vote for Donald Trump.
[02:37:40.663 --> 02:37:44.404]  We don't want to attack the man, because that even gives him power.
[02:37:44.484 --> 02:37:54.226]  I mean, the guy has lost much of his audience, just as Fox has lost half of one of its key demographics, and has now had a coup and is basically pro-Hillary in many cases.
[02:37:54.726 --> 02:37:58.307]  This is a bellwether of how the globalists are making their full move.
[02:37:58.387 --> 02:37:59.707]  Or do you disagree with me, Mr. Haven?
[02:38:00.007 --> 02:38:01.188]  No, no, I agree.
[02:38:01.228 --> 02:38:06.249]  And I tell you, I used to be a big Glenn Beck fan when he was on Fox.
[02:38:06.949 --> 02:38:08.851]  You know, I don't know what happened.
[02:38:09.051 --> 02:38:10.112]  You know, you can speculate.
[02:38:10.132 --> 02:38:11.334]  They got to him or whatever.
[02:38:12.375 --> 02:38:19.282]  And then he's just kind of gone nuts with his cruise and the missionic cruise thing he had going on.
[02:38:19.342 --> 02:38:20.724]  So it's astounding what he's doing.
[02:38:20.764 --> 02:38:22.265]  But he's certainly imploding.
[02:38:22.285 --> 02:38:25.449]  But I'm going to tell you about this Black Lives Matter thing.
[02:38:27.691 --> 02:38:30.533]  I've got nothing to apologize because I love people.
[02:38:30.573 --> 02:38:31.654]  I don't care what color they are.
[02:38:32.395 --> 02:38:37.059]  I feed 10,000 black children a day in Haiti and have ever since the earthquake.
[02:38:38.540 --> 02:38:42.863]  I go there and embrace them and love on them and it's irrelevant what color they are.
[02:38:43.043 --> 02:38:44.645]  In fact, I have gone to Haiti with Ted Cruz.
[02:38:46.045 --> 02:38:47.446]  Not Ted Cruz, but with Rand Paul.
[02:38:47.486 --> 02:38:47.986]  That's Rand Paul.
[02:38:48.046 --> 02:38:49.806]  Yeah, in fact, that's a great little story.
[02:38:49.826 --> 02:38:50.546]  I'll tell it real quick.
[02:38:50.887 --> 02:38:52.287]  Rand Paul is an eye surgeon.
[02:38:52.727 --> 02:39:01.469]  We took him and two other eye surgeons over, and they did cataract surgery on 200 blind elderly patients, and of course they're all black.
[02:39:01.990 --> 02:39:05.471]  And from one day they were blind, then the next day they could see.
[02:39:05.791 --> 02:39:10.172]  So, you know, I, by the way, my dad's done stuff like that for dentistry, but I'll never even talk about it.
[02:39:10.772 --> 02:39:12.374]  Oh, I'm not racist.
[02:39:12.514 --> 02:39:13.976]  We do tooth work on black people.
[02:39:14.116 --> 02:39:14.857]  They're just humans.
[02:39:15.178 --> 02:39:15.358]  Yeah.
[02:39:15.658 --> 02:39:16.679]  That's how we want to be treated.
[02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:17.420]  Absolutely.
[02:39:17.981 --> 02:39:20.985]  And so this phone... Meanwhile, the Clinton Foundation steals the money for Haiti.
[02:39:21.425 --> 02:39:21.866]  Unbelievable.
[02:39:21.886 --> 02:39:23.007]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[02:39:23.027 --> 02:39:23.768]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:39:23.788 --> 02:39:26.011]  That's a great point, and I have the stats on that.
[02:39:27.672 --> 02:39:34.016]  96% of the money that Clinton has collected for Haitian relief went into the Clintons' pockets.
[02:39:34.516 --> 02:39:37.038]  Into payroll for their family members and their associates.
[02:39:37.218 --> 02:39:40.380]  That's admitted!
[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:41.761]  97% they give to themselves!
[02:39:42.521 --> 02:39:45.303]  They take their money and then they give it to themselves tax exempt.
[02:39:46.223 --> 02:39:47.023]  That's extraordinary.
[02:39:47.544 --> 02:39:57.089]  So, you know, the facts are that Republicans, and particularly evangelical Christians, donate significantly more to charity.
[02:39:57.449 --> 02:40:01.232]  Six times more than the liberals and these other people.
[02:40:01.672 --> 02:40:08.336]  You know, even Ted Cruz was giving two or three percent of his income, and by the way, none to churches.
[02:40:08.916 --> 02:40:11.077]  And so, you know, look where people spend their money.
[02:40:11.117 --> 02:40:11.998]  That's where their hearts are.
[02:40:13.973 --> 02:40:14.874]  Mine's fighting the globals.
[02:40:14.934 --> 02:40:18.037]  I spend almost everything comes in just trying to build up a fight to these people.
[02:40:18.217 --> 02:40:18.398]  Yeah.
[02:40:18.558 --> 02:40:21.961]  And what's scary is every level we go up we're more successful.
[02:40:22.041 --> 02:40:22.402]  I'm like...
[02:40:23.806 --> 02:40:36.858]  As a humble person, it feels good that we're having an effect, but it feels weird to have the Secret Service leaking us info, and the Pentagon, and it's accurate info, and real, and it's like a movie.
[02:40:36.898 --> 02:40:39.100]  It's like, why me?
[02:40:41.242 --> 02:40:49.610]  You know, you're humble, and I don't think many people would use that word to you, but you have a humility, and that's what makes you usable.
[02:40:49.950 --> 02:40:55.052]  You know, God raises up people that will be obedient and not take themselves... Sure, I'm personally humble.
[02:40:55.092 --> 02:40:56.433]  I get aggressive with the New World Order.
[02:40:56.753 --> 02:40:57.933]  Yeah, and that's a good thing.
[02:40:58.774 --> 02:41:00.674]  Because that aggressiveness doesn't come from you.
[02:41:00.954 --> 02:41:06.937]  It comes from your purpose and what you've been raised up for in this place and in this time.
[02:41:07.697 --> 02:41:09.378]  And I'm proud to be sitting here with you.
[02:41:09.398 --> 02:41:11.859]  Well, I'm proud to be with you and the listeners and just all these amazing people.
[02:41:11.879 --> 02:41:12.940]  It really is great.
[02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:16.202]  That's what this big animating contest is, is finding who's good and who's bad.
[02:41:16.222 --> 02:41:18.243]  And I'm working every day to be good.
[02:41:18.483 --> 02:41:19.263]  Let me ask you this, then.
[02:41:19.323 --> 02:41:23.365]  What happens if Trump loses, they steal it, whatever, Hillary gets in?
[02:41:23.625 --> 02:41:24.746]  She's clearly got problems.
[02:41:24.766 --> 02:41:26.127]  What do you make of this Cain guy?
[02:41:28.049 --> 02:41:38.997]  Well, I'm afraid Hillary's health issues are so severe right now that they already plan to elevate Kaine to the presidential office.
[02:41:39.458 --> 02:41:43.341]  And it's hard to, there's not much known about him.
[02:41:43.921 --> 02:41:50.626]  A friend of mine is a state rep in Virginia, and I've been able to get some insight from him.
[02:41:51.727 --> 02:41:52.908]  Cain's not a nice guy.
[02:41:52.988 --> 02:41:55.931]  He is absolutely bought and paid for by the globalists.
[02:41:56.511 --> 02:42:00.214]  He will do their bidding obediently, just as another puppet.
[02:42:00.675 --> 02:42:04.338]  We're going to have another Obama probably even on steroids, so we know what we've got.
[02:42:07.060 --> 02:42:12.945]  The globalists will have another maneuver where they're going to continue what they're doing.
[02:42:13.246 --> 02:42:16.608]  Well, we talked to security people who were just at a meeting.
[02:42:17.889 --> 02:42:19.289]  And this is a good source.
[02:42:19.770 --> 02:42:32.712]  What we were told was, they don't even care, they're just sitting around openly talking about a false flag to make Hillary look like a victim just to get her in and then get Kaine in and then if Trump tries something with that, they're talking about, I mean, sorry go ahead.
[02:42:32.912 --> 02:42:37.974]  Well you know what, I think there very well might be an attempt on Hillary's life that
[02:42:40.566 --> 02:42:48.852]  That may not be successful, but somehow the rhetoric of Trump is going to be blamed for that attack.
[02:42:48.872 --> 02:42:50.593]  That's why they seized on his Second Amendment thing.
[02:42:51.454 --> 02:42:52.215]  Their prepackaging.
[02:42:56.938 --> 02:43:11.764]  The harshness of his tone, which is unfortunate sometimes because he creates a lot of problems for himself, but they're going to easily be able to attribute at least the environment that caused an attempt on Hillary Clinton's life.
[02:43:11.784 --> 02:43:13.465]  Meanwhile, they're the ones trying to fund cop killers.
[02:43:14.477 --> 02:43:15.257]  And guess what?
[02:43:15.317 --> 02:43:24.040]  We're all going to be feeling sorry for Hillary, and people are going to vote for Kay, and she's going to get Kay in the sympathy vote, or she'll get the sympathy vote.
[02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:25.700]  But here's another interesting point.
[02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:34.022]  You are helping to wake people up to the impairment of her health, and how that would normally disqualify her for the office.
[02:43:34.563 --> 02:43:35.763]  So an attempt on her life,
[02:43:36.383 --> 02:43:43.005]  That's unsuccessful, moves the sympathy vote in a place to cover the incompetency issue.
[02:43:43.405 --> 02:43:45.186]  So I think all of this is falling into place.
[02:43:46.186 --> 02:43:58.430]  I just can't believe that they are getting picked up, you know, in private hangars by diplomatic security and just in the cars, in the mansions, just sitting around right in front of security, just talking about incredible crimes.
[02:43:59.170 --> 02:44:01.431]  And I'm just like, I don't want to go up against these people.
[02:44:02.111 --> 02:44:07.272]  Every day I've got, I mean, I'm not bitching, but at a certain point, this is not, this is not, this is not fun.
[02:44:07.292 --> 02:44:12.813]  And I just wish the public understood how much peril we're in.
[02:44:13.294 --> 02:44:15.074]  And I think the audience does know that.
[02:44:16.314 --> 02:44:23.036]  I'm worried about all the trendies, Gary, just the average people that just buy into the system, the la-la land that they must be in.
[02:44:24.571 --> 02:44:26.431]  I'm doing a big conference this week.
[02:44:26.451 --> 02:44:30.332]  It's going to be recorded and put out on the Jim Bakker Show.
[02:44:31.253 --> 02:44:37.854]  And the title, or the purpose of my speech is to talk about truth, and the sword of truth.
[02:44:38.494 --> 02:44:44.756]  And we as thinking people, much less as Christians, have got to be willing to take
[02:44:45.296 --> 02:44:52.443]  Truth is harsh, as scary as it is, and we've got to bring it into the battle place.
[02:44:53.463 --> 02:44:54.745]  And we do have truth on our side.
[02:44:55.325 --> 02:44:58.728]  But it's scary, it's overwhelming, even you're feeling it right now.
[02:44:59.389 --> 02:45:00.370]  Oh, it is scary.
[02:45:00.410 --> 02:45:08.357]  Well, it's exciting, though, that you're able to reach, because I know he reaches over 130 million, 50 million people, something like that, or homes, that you're making inroads all over.
[02:45:08.377 --> 02:45:10.118]  I mean, I hear people all over the place talking about
[02:45:10.959 --> 02:45:18.561]  You might have been the guy, I know you don't want the credit, but that tipped it on Cruz for people on all the big Christian networks, because you're respected there warning people about Cruz.
[02:45:19.041 --> 02:45:19.521]  Yeah, it's neat.
[02:45:19.541 --> 02:45:40.306]  You know, as a nationalist, as somebody who believes in the sovereignty of our country and having borders and the Constitution and the blessing that it has been for us and even the rest of the world, you know, I'm able to work within the media with you and other people.
[02:45:40.906 --> 02:45:50.211]  But as a Christian, and somebody who's been very involved in bringing the Gospel to the public, I'm able to walk in that arena too.
[02:45:50.271 --> 02:45:52.352]  I've been on the 700 Club many, many times.
[02:45:53.372 --> 02:45:57.134]  The American Family Association, Tim Waldem and I are good friends.
[02:45:57.194 --> 02:45:58.194]  I'm on there frequently.
[02:45:58.735 --> 02:46:06.478]  And now with Jim Baker, with a huge audience, I've been able to really talk about globalism in a Christian environment.
[02:46:06.798 --> 02:46:09.580]  Remember, a lot of evangelicals, they don't want to hear about this stuff.
[02:46:10.321 --> 02:46:15.213]  That's clearly why they went after Baker a long time ago because he's more open to those things.
[02:46:15.902 --> 02:46:18.943]  Yeah, and I tell you, Jim Bakker's a fascinating guy.
[02:46:19.163 --> 02:46:21.643]  I've really gotten to be good friends with him.
[02:46:22.223 --> 02:46:24.924]  And this man was friends with almost every president.
[02:46:25.644 --> 02:46:26.924]  He had tremendous influence.
[02:46:27.544 --> 02:46:30.185]  He was the creator of all the major... And that's why they went after him.
[02:46:30.585 --> 02:46:33.946]  And then there I was as a kid watching mainstream media believing it was all crap.
[02:46:34.486 --> 02:46:36.726]  I mean, just like they say about myself or anybody.
[02:46:37.546 --> 02:46:39.647]  That's why they target young people, because they don't know.
[02:46:41.066 --> 02:46:41.547]  It's so sad.
[02:46:41.567 --> 02:46:47.832]  I want to get back into Black Lives Matter because we've had stories that have like 20,000 comments, okay?
[02:46:48.092 --> 02:46:51.255]  We've had stories that have been seen by over 2 million people because drugs linked to it.
[02:46:51.515 --> 02:46:52.376]  Top drug story.
[02:46:53.877 --> 02:47:00.403]  And it's so pathetic that I can't even play these clips because I know it's a psyop.
[02:47:00.723 --> 02:47:04.266]  I need to play it to expose it as a psyop, but it makes me sick.
[02:47:04.326 --> 02:47:07.589]  I don't get off on seeing people act like racist moron idiots.
[02:47:08.871 --> 02:47:20.071]  But it does expose political correctness that it's created this situation where it's made so many minority groups in these enclaves super racist and they don't even know it but playing some of these clips since I mentioned it.
[02:47:21.704 --> 02:47:26.309]  Burn Down White Suburbs, Sister of Man Killed by Milwaukee Police Urges Rioters.
[02:47:26.329 --> 02:47:27.430]  We're going to play that in a moment.
[02:47:27.450 --> 02:47:30.393]  But first, let's play Glenn Beck, since I've been mentioning this all day.
[02:47:30.753 --> 02:47:34.677]  Here's Glenn Beck, says he understands and relates to Black Lives Matter.
[02:47:34.938 --> 02:47:41.885]  No, you say, I relate to all communities, black communities, and when some cops do bad things, I understand the anger and the profiling.
[02:47:42.125 --> 02:47:42.706]  No, no, no, no.
[02:47:43.046 --> 02:47:49.811]  He understands Black Lives Matter, and in the larger piece I listened to this morning, he again acts like conservatives really are racist and don't care.
[02:47:50.131 --> 02:47:51.332]  What a load of manure!
[02:47:51.692 --> 02:47:58.738]  As you said, it's conservatives I know that are actually really involved in real charities and education programs trying to build up communities.
[02:47:59.138 --> 02:48:02.641]  Patriots and Christians don't get off on somebody in squalor.
[02:48:02.921 --> 02:48:08.765]  The left does and wants to put you in that to control you, and then writes university plans on it, Cloward and Pevin.
[02:48:09.146 --> 02:48:10.266]  So let's play Glenn Beck.
[02:48:10.286 --> 02:48:10.627]  Here it is.
[02:48:12.902 --> 02:48:14.185]  All pie matters.
[02:48:14.205 --> 02:48:16.649]  ALL PIE MATTERS!
[02:48:18.372 --> 02:48:19.714]  Okay, that's not the clip I wanted.
[02:48:19.834 --> 02:48:21.557]  It's him on NPR.
[02:48:22.850 --> 02:48:29.695]  Yeah, there's an audio clip from NPR I want to play, sorry if I told you video, where he just goes and apologizes for conservatives.
[02:48:29.735 --> 02:48:32.097]  And I'm just saying, that's not who he represents.
[02:48:32.157 --> 02:48:42.525]  He does not get to go on TV shows, I mean he can, we're going to counter it, and say that we're not conservatives, but he is when he supports Hillary Clinton for the office of the White House.
[02:48:42.585 --> 02:48:47.929]  I mean, as far as I'm concerned, if you support Glenn Beck, you have a serious problem.
[02:48:47.949 --> 02:48:49.190]  Because I just don't see how you do.
[02:48:51.024 --> 02:48:56.155]  And how could he possibly think Hillary as president is a good idea?
[02:48:56.778 --> 02:49:00.160]  You know, did you get to see Denise D'Souza's film yet?
[02:49:00.220 --> 02:49:01.360]  Oh yes, finally, yeah.
[02:49:01.540 --> 02:49:03.802]  Oh my goodness, everybody needs to see that film.
[02:49:04.642 --> 02:49:11.706]  And you realize the Democratic Party is responsible for so many of the ills of the minority population of our country.
[02:49:12.066 --> 02:49:14.607]  And it's just as clear as day now.
[02:49:15.147 --> 02:49:21.691]  And surely Glenn Beck has some historical context
[02:49:24.472 --> 02:49:28.313]  He stands up and says Democrats are good for the minority people?
[02:49:29.494 --> 02:49:33.835]  I think he looks completely insane and I think he's being handled by people.
[02:49:34.516 --> 02:49:42.798]  Continuing here with the next clip, I want to play the sister of the man that was shot, the felon, waving guns at the black cop, waving a gun so he got shot.
[02:49:43.119 --> 02:49:47.580]  I want to play her though saying, don't burn down the black area, go burn down the suburb.
[02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:48.740]  It's code for white people.
[02:49:50.521 --> 02:49:52.523]  I mean, this is just absolutely crazy.
[02:49:52.883 --> 02:49:54.004]  But in a way, she's right.
[02:49:54.525 --> 02:49:56.406]  It's really dumb to burn down your own neighborhood.
[02:49:56.907 --> 02:49:59.249]  Because I saw quotes where we're going to burn down our own neighborhood.
[02:49:59.789 --> 02:50:00.690]  Let's go and play that club.
[02:50:17.518 --> 02:50:21.420]  I'm gonna skip this break too.
[02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:22.820]  I'm just done with all of it.
[02:50:22.920 --> 02:50:24.841]  We're gonna go a little bit in the next hour or two.
[02:50:24.901 --> 02:50:28.203]  Anthony Gutierrez coming up at Mr. Haven looking at this.
[02:50:30.365 --> 02:50:30.965]  What do you think?
[02:50:30.985 --> 02:50:33.427]  I mean, I know it's divide and conquer, but what's the larger game plan?
[02:50:33.447 --> 02:50:52.760]  Because the average white person is a totally guilt-addled person that hates themselves and basically thinks that they've got all these things to prove that they've done it wrong, but then the media tells them, well, just support Obamacare, that's how you're not racist, which basically cuts people on their hours and is a giant global screwjob.
[02:50:54.100 --> 02:50:56.161]  So, I'm not bashing Christianity.
[02:50:56.521 --> 02:50:59.783]  I'm a Christian, but it is abolitionist in England and then the U.S.
[02:50:59.823 --> 02:51:01.963]  that ended up finally ending slavery in the West.
[02:51:02.264 --> 02:51:05.145]  Still goes on today, but it's kind of trendy and cool in Africa or the Middle East.
[02:51:05.925 --> 02:51:10.247]  But they take our Christian ethos that's been taken away from us, but still
[02:51:11.260 --> 02:51:14.202]  I don't want to call it guilt, Christian guilt, but caring about others.
[02:51:14.502 --> 02:51:24.288]  And they manipulate that to where you take the Republican Party that's the abolitionist Christians and you somehow transmute it around where they're the evil racists and the KKK Democrats are the good guys.
[02:51:24.909 --> 02:51:26.189]  What is the extrapolation?
[02:51:26.209 --> 02:51:31.453]  I mean, I can move four or five levels up here in chess, but how about ten levels?
[02:51:31.853 --> 02:51:33.574]  Where is this going out there?
[02:51:33.614 --> 02:51:37.577]  Because for me, it seems so transparent and looks like it's going to fail.
[02:51:38.457 --> 02:51:39.418]  What's the larger plan?
[02:51:40.250 --> 02:51:42.411]  Well, it goes back to the Hegelian dialectic.
[02:51:43.091 --> 02:51:54.955]  And Hegel was a German philosopher in the early 1800s, and he designed, and of course this has been going on for thousands of years, but he figured out that if you want to acquire power, you create problems.
[02:51:55.536 --> 02:51:58.437]  And then when you come in with a solution, that's how you get control.
[02:51:59.417 --> 02:52:01.238]  And this has been in practice a long, long time.
[02:52:01.278 --> 02:52:07.020]  So ultimately, the globalists, the elitists, want to acquire power by creating chaos.
[02:52:07.700 --> 02:52:08.902]  And there's so many things.
[02:52:08.962 --> 02:52:10.544]  It's bringing in the Syrian refugees.
[02:52:10.624 --> 02:52:11.505]  It's opening the border.
[02:52:11.866 --> 02:52:13.208]  And it's also Black Lives Matter.
[02:52:13.288 --> 02:52:15.130]  It's all part of the strategy.
[02:52:15.751 --> 02:52:19.757]  So what people need to do is they need to think and they need to think clearly.
[02:52:20.338 --> 02:52:24.143]  They need to have the confidence and their ability to really work through things.
[02:52:24.663 --> 02:52:31.448]  And I tell you, it's such a mess right now, it's been going on so long, I understand it's difficult to really get to the bottom of these things.
[02:52:32.469 --> 02:52:41.336]  The first thing I would do, as an American, is when I hear something on the news, when I see these events that are hard to explain, that are confusing,
[02:52:42.017 --> 02:52:52.089]  Uh, the police officers being shot in Dallas is an example, or again in Baton Rouge, where initially there were multiple shooters and then finally there's only one and they're killed.
[02:52:52.810 --> 02:52:57.596]  I would question, in fact I would assume it's a false flag, a PSYOP.
[02:52:58.477 --> 02:53:01.159]  Almost everything the government puts out and does right now.
[02:53:01.699 --> 02:53:07.022]  And make the assumption that it's probably not true because they lie to you, they lie to you, they lie to you.
[02:53:07.623 --> 02:53:13.986]  And from a position of doubt, begin to absorb this information and consider it.
[02:53:14.447 --> 02:53:18.789]  But this is all about creating chaos because that's where you acquire power.
[02:53:19.490 --> 02:53:23.352]  And if you think about it that way, it's actually quite simple right now.
[02:53:24.195 --> 02:53:36.464]  Whether it's the unvetted Syrians or them trying to take away our weapons, it's all by design to diminish America, to diminish our freedoms, our ability to protect ourselves, so that they can acquire power.
[02:53:37.064 --> 02:53:38.626]  And it's been going on a long time.
[02:53:39.146 --> 02:53:42.648]  And I tell you what, they've made tremendous inroads in succeeding.
[02:53:43.009 --> 02:53:47.692]  They have practically destroyed Europe through the influx of these immigrants.
[02:53:48.433 --> 02:53:49.994]  Sweden, the rape capital of the world.
[02:53:51.915 --> 02:53:54.776]  Yeah, they're not bringing in Middle Easterners from some of the nicer countries.
[02:53:54.816 --> 02:54:00.957]  They are bringing in people from failed states, where the Muslims run around murdering each other all day, and it's just hellish.
[02:54:01.318 --> 02:54:07.719]  And 80% of these immigrants are men of the age of being able to fight.
[02:54:08.720 --> 02:54:12.000]  They're not bringing in a lot of women or children, and they certainly aren't bringing in Christians.
[02:54:12.020 --> 02:54:12.000]  0.3%?
[02:54:13.041 --> 02:54:17.622]  Yeah, and the Christians are the ones that are being persecuted more than anybody.
[02:54:17.722 --> 02:54:18.563]  Then Obama makes jokes.
[02:54:18.583 --> 02:54:20.805]  So it really is just nasty anti-Christian garbage.
[02:54:21.085 --> 02:54:25.169]  What about the Pope coming out and saying, you don't want to hear about Christianity and its horrible roots in Europe.
[02:54:25.469 --> 02:54:26.230]  Europe isn't Christian.
[02:54:26.250 --> 02:54:26.851]  I mean, that's a quote.
[02:54:27.151 --> 02:54:28.152]  That's extraordinary, isn't it?
[02:54:29.413 --> 02:54:30.394]  What are Catholics thinking?
[02:54:30.414 --> 02:54:33.097]  I mean, it seems like evil's making its move on every front.
[02:54:33.457 --> 02:54:34.578]  There's an intensification.
[02:54:35.399 --> 02:54:40.681]  Yeah, you know, I'm not Catholic, but I got a lot of friends that are, and I bring it up at my peril sometimes.
[02:54:41.361 --> 02:54:57.128]  And I tell you, they're either waking up and realizing the Pope has a different agenda, or they're in blind denial that the Pope is still this great guy who's just being misquoted all the time.
[02:54:57.388 --> 02:55:00.169]  But there's a great divide in the Catholic Church occurring right now.
[02:55:02.050 --> 02:55:10.877]  As the Pope continues down his socialist path, which is empowering governments and really diminishing Christians in the Middle East.
[02:55:11.158 --> 02:55:15.541]  You know, he brings in the Imam into the Vatican.
[02:55:15.581 --> 02:55:16.922]  It's all over the top.
[02:55:16.942 --> 02:55:19.564]  If you told people ten years ago this would be happening, they'd say you were crazy.
[02:55:20.769 --> 02:55:21.709]  It is hard to believe.
[02:55:22.570 --> 02:55:29.171]  You know, we've got to get people to look at the evidence, because the evidence is in front of our eyes right now.
[02:55:29.191 --> 02:55:31.932]  The Pope calls for world government on a weekly basis?
[02:55:32.552 --> 02:55:33.953]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:55:34.133 --> 02:55:36.213]  So where does it go next after this then?
[02:55:37.414 --> 02:55:45.696]  Well, you know, I can answer that from my own judgment, or from influence by the biblical, that's right.
[02:55:46.836 --> 02:55:48.377]  I think we're going to have world government.
[02:55:49.221 --> 02:55:55.044]  And this is where the Antichrist comes in, the Mark of the Beast, and, you know, the Bible talks about it.
[02:55:55.784 --> 02:55:57.145]  They're already saying, get rid of cash.
[02:55:57.385 --> 02:55:58.045]  It's all happening.
[02:55:58.385 --> 02:55:58.545]  Yep.
[02:55:58.646 --> 02:56:03.328]  So the question is, what can we do to not be victims of it?
[02:56:03.888 --> 02:56:15.433]  And I've kind of held out for a long time, and I've talked to the governor about this, that Texas might be a sanctuary where we stand against the tyranny of an out-of-control federal government.
[02:56:16.554 --> 02:56:16.894]  But, you know,
[02:56:20.015 --> 02:56:31.418]  Obama could snap his fingers and create an economic emergency, and under an emergency like that, can declare martial law, and then the second right, freedom of speech, all these things are gone.
[02:56:32.378 --> 02:56:37.879]  So instead of eroding them and trying to do it through either executive order... That may be building up for the big move.
[02:56:38.299 --> 02:56:39.199]  Yeah, I'm afraid.
[02:56:39.279 --> 02:56:43.100]  And the answer at that point is, this is the big test, don't submit, speak out even more.
[02:56:44.338 --> 02:56:46.099]  Yeah, the Bible's real clear about it.
[02:56:46.119 --> 02:56:47.621]  If you take the mark, you're lost.
[02:56:48.141 --> 02:56:50.723]  So, we are facing some serious times.
[02:56:51.183 --> 02:56:54.806]  You know, it kind of brings us back to our movie.
[02:56:55.126 --> 02:57:02.112]  The theme of the movie is that there's going to be, by design, an EMP attack on America.
[02:57:02.132 --> 02:57:03.173]  Let's get to that in a minute.
[02:57:03.273 --> 02:57:04.654]  I'm sorry, Gary, but you just said that.
[02:57:04.734 --> 02:57:05.455]  It's so epic.
[02:57:06.260 --> 02:57:09.041]  They've got ABC saying every child will soon have a microchip.
[02:57:09.201 --> 02:57:09.401]  Yeah.
[02:57:09.961 --> 02:57:10.862]  It's all happening.
[02:57:10.942 --> 02:57:14.143]  Everything the Bible talked about is actually unfolding now.
[02:57:15.163 --> 02:57:17.444]  And the mainline churches aren't even making a big deal about it.
[02:57:18.044 --> 02:57:20.225]  And we're just sitting here witnessing all this.
[02:57:20.245 --> 02:57:20.985]  This is crazy.
[02:57:22.265 --> 02:57:30.171]  You know, the Bible says there's going to be wars, rumors of wars, earthquakes in diverse places.
[02:57:30.191 --> 02:57:31.112]  A world government.
[02:57:31.132 --> 02:57:33.474]  We've got to have a mark in the hand of the forehead to buy or sell.
[02:57:33.534 --> 02:57:33.914]  It's here.
[02:57:33.934 --> 02:57:36.116]  Yeah, the technology is here.
[02:57:36.856 --> 02:57:46.364]  And behind the technology, you see the movements, political, global, where they bring financial, where they're bringing all this into a very likely outcome.
[02:57:46.984 --> 02:57:48.826]  And it's so obvious now.
[02:57:49.606 --> 02:57:54.889]  People should not be... But then I've studied the elite themselves and they're into the occult and believe Lucifer's God.
[02:57:55.209 --> 02:57:55.389]  Yeah.
[02:57:55.950 --> 02:57:57.090]  And that's the end of the deal.
[02:57:57.470 --> 02:58:01.993]  Global government... And then Lucifer's telling them, I'm going to give you eternal life and all knowledge, same thing he said in the garden.
[02:58:02.353 --> 02:58:04.874]  And you go, okay, well the garden didn't exist, you know, or whatever, you're an atheist.
[02:58:04.914 --> 02:58:06.375]  But it's happening now.
[02:58:06.395 --> 02:58:11.758]  Whether it's Peter Thiel or Ray Kurzweil, they're all saying, we're going to be gods, we're going to be gods.
[02:58:12.558 --> 02:58:13.399]  It's all Genesis.
[02:58:15.316 --> 02:58:17.218]  It's amazing, isn't it?
[02:58:17.718 --> 02:58:23.523]  And I tell you, I'm trying to wake up Christians in particular because... Just thank God God gave us this info beforehand.
[02:58:23.703 --> 02:58:24.344]  Yep.
[02:58:24.404 --> 02:58:25.505]  And I think for a purpose.
[02:58:26.145 --> 02:58:37.195]  And we're fulfilling that purpose right now because we're teaching it to people and then we're calling them to... Imagine being people in the desert 2,000 years ago in scrolls and caves writing all this down and it's happening.
[02:58:39.625 --> 02:58:39.985]  Stay there.
[02:58:40.785 --> 02:58:42.746]  The film, Amerigeddon, everybody needs to see it.
[02:58:43.086 --> 02:58:46.748]  Great way to wake people up and it helps fund the operation and Gary's great investment.

[02:59:01.215 --> 02:59:02.555]  Article by Business Insider.
[02:59:02.715 --> 02:59:05.256]  Americans are getting concerned about rising home prices.
[02:59:05.476 --> 02:59:07.696]  The gap between supply and demand is widening.
[02:59:07.856 --> 02:59:12.517]  It's being dubbed the new housing crisis, and the gap is taking median house prices through the roof.
[02:59:12.737 --> 02:59:17.939]  San Jose is the first city to have an MHP of $1 million for a one-family house last quarter.
[02:59:18.059 --> 02:59:24.580]  Low interest rates are creating higher demand to buy homes, according to the Consumer Sentiment Survey from the University of Michigan, which also states,
[02:59:25.120 --> 02:59:31.604]  Home buying has become particularly dependent on low interest rates, with net references to low interest rates spontaneously mentioned by 48%.
[02:59:32.064 --> 02:59:35.946]  This figure has been exceeded in only two months in the past 10 years.
[02:59:36.286 --> 02:59:42.269]  In English, low rates may rise soon if the Fed changes its tune, so buyers want to take advantage of the rates now.
[02:59:42.530 --> 02:59:44.210]  Rates are low, but not housing prices.
[02:59:44.411 --> 02:59:50.174]  Quote, low housing prices were cited by just 25%, according to the survey's release, the lowest figure in 10 years.
[02:59:50.774 --> 02:59:53.157]  This is starting to create a dissonance of sorts in Americans.
[02:59:53.337 --> 02:59:57.842]  Little do many of them know, a bubble is set to burst and what's to come is yet the worst.
[02:59:58.042 --> 03:00:00.645]  This is Gabe Goldiamond for InfoWars.com.
[03:00:02.687 --> 03:00:05.270]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:18.032 --> 03:00:19.655]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:19.976 --> 03:00:24.303]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:28.200 --> 03:00:32.843]  Gary Havens, our guest, America Edmonds, the film, exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:00:33.323 --> 03:00:36.385]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, Anthony Gutiard is going to come in here in the studio.
[03:00:37.025 --> 03:00:41.028]  I'm overriding things right now and take over the last 30 minutes with a lot of fresh news and info.
[03:00:41.048 --> 03:00:43.089]  9 o'clock news is tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:00:43.109 --> 03:00:51.014]  Reporters are going to Milwaukee, where Trump's giving a speech tomorrow outside Milwaukee, and where there'll probably be more riots and shooting tonight to cover that.
[03:00:51.474 --> 03:00:54.336]  Finishing up the whole Black Lives Matter thing in this short segment, Gary,
[03:00:56.280 --> 03:00:59.262]  Beck has come out and said, we need to, you know, love everybody, understand this.
[03:00:59.642 --> 03:01:05.326]  But again, that's to make him look like the new sweet conservative, the guy that apologizes for conservatives because we're bad.
[03:01:06.067 --> 03:01:10.710]  No, we need to say, as a patriot, I don't do conservative or liberal, I just try to do the right thing.
[03:01:11.851 --> 03:01:18.996]  We have groups funded by foreign globalists and Nazi collaborators like this, this horrible person, George Soros.
[03:01:20.560 --> 03:01:21.401]  They're doing this.
[03:01:21.901 --> 03:01:24.764]  No, the Black Lives Matter movement is a compromised, bad organization.
[03:01:24.804 --> 03:01:28.749]  We say that's bad, but obviously we understand the plight of people in inner cities.
[03:01:29.049 --> 03:01:29.209]  Yeah.
[03:01:29.790 --> 03:01:29.950]  Yeah.
[03:01:30.110 --> 03:01:30.991]  I mean, do you agree with that statement?
[03:01:31.832 --> 03:01:32.252]  Absolutely.
[03:01:32.773 --> 03:01:37.418]  We need to have empathy, but we also need to use our brains.
[03:01:38.439 --> 03:01:42.182]  You know, they released a study last month.
[03:01:42.202 --> 03:01:47.826]  There were 950 shootings by police officers in America in the first six months.
[03:01:47.866 --> 03:01:54.090]  Roughly 250 of them were blacks being shot, and many of them were shot by black police officers.
[03:01:54.971 --> 03:01:59.054]  But the other 750 were almost exclusively white.
[03:01:59.594 --> 03:02:00.615]  So we've got a
[03:02:01.235 --> 03:02:06.078]  We've got a problem, but it's not necessarily that we're shooting black people unfairly.
[03:02:06.738 --> 03:02:07.839]  Statistically, that is.
[03:02:07.859 --> 03:02:08.519]  That's the fact.
[03:02:08.559 --> 03:02:09.180]  Well, that's the fact.
[03:02:09.260 --> 03:02:12.201]  That's what's crazy, is they act like it's the biggest story in the world.
[03:02:12.261 --> 03:02:13.382]  It's made up.
[03:02:13.842 --> 03:02:14.022]  Yeah.
[03:02:14.523 --> 03:02:18.885]  While they abort over half the black babies, you know, and no one wants to, that's just millions.
[03:02:19.165 --> 03:02:19.325]  Yeah.
[03:02:19.725 --> 03:02:22.227]  Well, let's play the clip back just because I said we'd get to it.
[03:02:22.247 --> 03:02:23.307]  Here he is on NPR.
[03:02:23.588 --> 03:02:28.691]  He's the new guy that goes on and makes everybody look bad and apologizes for the conservatives.
[03:02:28.711 --> 03:02:29.031]  Here it is.
[03:02:29.904 --> 03:02:32.927]  I think it's important for us to appeal to everybody.
[03:02:34.529 --> 03:02:48.602]  You know, I had a new kind of thought on Black Lives Matter and the All Lives Matter thing, and the best way to explain it is, if we're all sitting around at a table having dinner and everybody gets pie,
[03:02:49.503 --> 03:02:50.344]  Except for you.
[03:02:51.365 --> 03:02:53.787]  And you say, my pie matters.
[03:02:53.827 --> 03:02:54.848]  I don't have pie.
[03:02:55.128 --> 03:02:58.291]  And everybody at the table looks at you and says, I know, all pie matters.
[03:02:59.071 --> 03:03:01.733]  It shows that the people at the table aren't really listening.
[03:03:01.753 --> 03:03:05.777]  I don't agree with the Black Lives Matter organizers.
[03:03:06.477 --> 03:03:08.980]  They are stated as anti-capitalists.
[03:03:09.600 --> 03:03:13.164]  And it's much more than just the police to them.
[03:03:13.224 --> 03:03:15.346]  It's about changing society entirely.
[03:03:15.906 --> 03:03:19.950]  But I can relate to them and understand them on many different fronts.
[03:03:20.651 --> 03:03:26.957]  And we need to start listening to each other and getting out of our own little... Ah, the club cuts out there.
[03:03:27.877 --> 03:03:29.799]  That is very, very twisted because...
[03:03:30.939 --> 03:03:42.569]  Statistically, it's an issue going on everywhere, and it is an issue, but compared to all the other issues, it's small, it's artificially manipulated by the social engineers, and here he is saying, no, you've got no pie.
[03:03:43.529 --> 03:03:53.898]  Well, no, if a cop out of control shoots you, whether you're Hispanic, black, white, that's an issue, but I mean, he's implying that the other lives actually don't matter, that even though they died, they still got pie.
[03:03:54.619 --> 03:03:55.940]  You know, I don't know what the hell he said.
[03:03:57.415 --> 03:03:58.536]  All pie matters.
[03:03:59.516 --> 03:04:01.658]  He's saying, you're at the table, you didn't get pie.
[03:04:02.278 --> 03:04:03.699]  And then you say, I want my pie.
[03:04:03.739 --> 03:04:06.021]  And they go, well, all pie matters.
[03:04:06.201 --> 03:04:06.761]  I heard that.
[03:04:06.801 --> 03:04:09.743]  Because everybody's had a piece of pie, I tell you.
[03:04:09.783 --> 03:04:11.684]  I'm telling you, man, it is the freak.
[03:04:11.824 --> 03:04:12.265]  Bizarre.
[03:04:13.100 --> 03:04:14.900]  Well, the point is, I don't know how long this is going to go on.
[03:04:14.940 --> 03:04:17.681]  I don't know how Clear Channel has this on 500 radio stations.
[03:04:18.641 --> 03:04:20.522]  I tune into it sometimes and it sounds like crazy.
[03:04:20.542 --> 03:04:24.623]  I don't mean to get off into Glenn Beck, it's just... By the way, there's another stat on that thing too.
[03:04:25.123 --> 03:04:34.705]  The black population is only 13%, but about 25% of them represented the cops killing people.
[03:04:35.205 --> 03:04:39.426]  The problem is 65% of violent crime is committed by
[03:04:40.126 --> 03:04:40.947]  By black people, so...
[03:05:10.786 --> 03:05:12.607]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:05:12.667 --> 03:05:14.547]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:05:14.687 --> 03:05:17.468]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:05:17.488 --> 03:05:23.470]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:05:23.670 --> 03:05:31.012]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[03:05:31.152 --> 03:05:32.534]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:05:32.834 --> 03:05:40.102]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:05:40.402 --> 03:05:48.110]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:05:48.430 --> 03:05:49.512]  The general public doesn't.
[03:05:50.590 --> 03:05:52.911]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:05:54.532 --> 03:05:57.954]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:05:58.095 --> 03:06:04.578]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:06:04.818 --> 03:06:08.901]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.

[03:07:10.356 --> 03:07:11.717]  Article by Business Insider.
[03:07:11.857 --> 03:07:14.419]  Americans are getting concerned about rising home prices.
[03:07:14.640 --> 03:07:16.842]  The gap between supply and demand is widening.
[03:07:17.022 --> 03:07:21.666]  It's being dubbed the new housing crisis, and the gap is taking median house prices through the roof.
[03:07:21.906 --> 03:07:27.090]  San Jose is the first city to have an MHP of $1 million for a one-family house last quarter.
[03:07:27.230 --> 03:07:33.756]  Low interest rates are creating higher demand to buy homes, according to the Consumer Sentiment Survey from the University of Michigan, which also states
[03:07:34.276 --> 03:07:40.762]  Home buying has become particularly dependent on low interest rates, with net references to low interest rates spontaneously mentioned by 48%.
[03:07:41.222 --> 03:07:45.126]  This figure has been exceeded in only two months in the past 10 years.
[03:07:45.446 --> 03:07:51.431]  In English, low rates may rise soon if the Fed changes its tune, so buyers want to take advantage of the rates now.
[03:07:51.691 --> 03:07:53.353]  Rates are low, but not housing prices.
[03:07:53.553 --> 03:07:59.741]  Quote, low housing prices were cited by just 25% according to the survey's release, the lowest figure in 10 years.
[03:07:59.941 --> 03:08:02.344]  This is starting to create a dissonance of sorts in Americans.
[03:08:02.504 --> 03:08:06.990]  Little do many of them know, a bubble is set to burst and what's to come is yet the worst.
[03:08:07.190 --> 03:08:09.373]  This is Gabe Golddiamond for InfoWars.com.
[03:08:19.881 --> 03:08:23.782]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:24.462 --> 03:08:29.943]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:39.244 --> 03:08:48.106]  Okay, Roger Stone has never called me this, uh... I wanna say upset, this, this, this... excited.
[03:08:49.138 --> 03:08:51.219]  So that's former Trump campaign head.
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:54.241]  Talk about being humble, how much he influences Trump.
[03:08:56.622 --> 03:08:58.323]  He is going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[03:08:58.343 --> 03:09:00.124]  I'm going to go ahead and just host all this hour.
[03:09:00.404 --> 03:09:02.485]  Gary Haven has said he wants to ride shotgun with us.
[03:09:03.426 --> 03:09:06.367]  So that is going to continue on here.
[03:09:06.407 --> 03:09:07.348]  We were getting into
[03:09:08.208 --> 03:09:09.729]  Crime statistics and things.
[03:09:10.529 --> 03:09:16.973]  It's just not fair to say there's an epidemic of white officers killing black people when it doesn't exist.
[03:09:17.153 --> 03:09:20.075]  So, we're not going, aha, we proved you black people wrong.
[03:09:20.355 --> 03:09:30.721]  We're saying this is total manipulation by a horrible war criminal who will go into Arab countries and put the radical Muslims in charge, who will go into one country and put Nazis in charge, and overthrow governments.
[03:09:30.761 --> 03:09:33.642]  I mean, he is a literal, literal James Bond villain.
[03:09:33.662 --> 03:09:36.184]  I mean, the new James Bond movie, it's the name of his company.
[03:09:36.704 --> 03:09:37.164]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:10:06.704 --> 03:10:19.073]  We're going to run through these clips, and I'm going to get into some of the other clips on TPP, you name it, with Gary Haben, who is the producer of Amerageddon, now exclusively available for the next week or so before it's in stores nationwide at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:10:19.293 --> 03:10:20.094]  But let's go to that clip.
[03:10:32.077 --> 03:10:34.118]  Take the s**t to the suburbs!
[03:10:34.178 --> 03:10:35.659]  Burn that s**t today!
[03:10:35.699 --> 03:10:37.160]  We need our s**t!
[03:10:37.220 --> 03:10:38.240]  We need our weave!
[03:10:38.660 --> 03:10:41.021]  I don't wear it, but we need it!
[03:10:41.942 --> 03:10:43.022]  We need our weaves.
[03:10:43.783 --> 03:10:48.305]  So that's the classic woman, you know, we need our lipstick and our everything else.
[03:10:48.425 --> 03:10:49.505]  I tell you, that comes first.
[03:10:50.106 --> 03:10:52.027]  I gotta love women, they're so sweet.
[03:10:52.367 --> 03:10:53.907]  And she's saying horrible stuff though!
[03:10:54.148 --> 03:10:56.889]  Go burn down the white people's neighborhood!
[03:10:57.429 --> 03:11:06.374]  But I gotta say, that's a step up from, I've got this one clip we played yesterday, where the guy says, here let me find it, I shouldn't laugh, but man this stuff's so sad, I gotta have some gallows humor.
[03:11:06.614 --> 03:11:07.834]  I laugh at myself too, folks.
[03:11:08.375 --> 03:11:15.678]  They got this guy going, we need stuff, the rich people aren't giving us money, so we burn down our own neighborhoods, the quote.
[03:11:16.339 --> 03:11:16.759]  I saw it.
[03:11:21.729 --> 03:11:28.475]  This group of people that are saying these things is the minority.
[03:11:29.315 --> 03:11:35.100]  Most black people in this country, they're God-fearing, they want to raise their kids, they want them educated.
[03:11:35.720 --> 03:11:37.421]  And we got to support them.
[03:11:37.441 --> 03:11:38.342]  Do they care about their families?
[03:11:38.582 --> 03:11:39.103]  You betcha.
[03:11:39.163 --> 03:11:40.283]  Well, no, absolutely.
[03:11:40.504 --> 03:11:42.385]  But look at the media pushing the narrative.
[03:11:43.025 --> 03:11:50.551]  Do you think Soros, because that's who they admit, I mean, he's targeting groups that don't want open borders, came out in his emails, he wants jihadis in the U.S.
[03:11:52.012 --> 03:11:53.213]  Do you think it's a winning strategy?
[03:11:54.329 --> 03:11:55.289]  Well, it's been effective.
[03:11:55.309 --> 03:11:55.789]  So here's the deal.
[03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:59.011]  I'm not against the Muslims in general, and I'm not against black people either.
[03:11:59.171 --> 03:12:02.792]  But I'm not going to sit here and make an excuse and put provisos in.
[03:12:02.892 --> 03:12:05.513]  I haven't done anything to anybody, and it's just not true.
[03:12:05.533 --> 03:12:13.195]  And so it's just crazy, because if I respond to it all sweet, people think I'm guilty and they don't listen.
[03:12:14.295 --> 03:12:16.416]  How do I slap folks upside the head in a loving way?
[03:12:16.916 --> 03:12:17.897]  I don't mean black people.
[03:12:17.937 --> 03:12:18.737]  I mean mainly the white
[03:12:19.497 --> 03:12:22.238]  Pimps of this that push it and use it.
[03:12:22.318 --> 03:12:22.538]  Yeah.
[03:12:22.558 --> 03:12:32.019]  You know, you do your best to state facts, to state the truth and the motive that's going on there, and you just pray to God that some of these people will start listening.
[03:12:32.059 --> 03:12:34.020]  They'll wake up and see the evidence.
[03:12:34.040 --> 03:12:34.920]  The evidence is clear!
[03:12:34.940 --> 03:12:40.061]  And what you're saying makes a lot more sense than the myths that they're perpetrating.
[03:12:40.581 --> 03:12:47.542]  You know, it reminds me, I remember when Obeck over there referred to George Soros as Spooky Dude.
[03:12:48.508 --> 03:12:54.940]  I wonder if Spooky Dude has become his new hero since he's aligned himself with Black Lives Matter.
[03:12:55.100 --> 03:12:55.942]  I was told this.
[03:12:56.142 --> 03:13:00.269]  I was told that Glenn Beck met four years ago with George Soros in New York for a three hour meeting.
[03:13:01.391 --> 03:13:01.532]  Yeah.
[03:13:02.640 --> 03:13:03.481]  I've never said that to him.
[03:13:03.922 --> 03:13:06.124]  I was told this by Beck's security detail.
[03:13:06.464 --> 03:13:11.590]  You know, folks better watch what they're saying in front of their security details, because these guys are patriots, on average.
[03:13:11.830 --> 03:13:13.231]  Yeah, that's an interesting thought.
[03:13:13.271 --> 03:13:17.596]  Yeah, a lot of good information comes from these people who actually care about this country.
[03:13:18.117 --> 03:13:20.019]  We saw how he went running to Zuckerberg.
[03:13:20.714 --> 03:13:21.134]  Yeah.
[03:13:21.214 --> 03:13:22.816]  I don't want to get off into a back bash fest.
[03:13:22.836 --> 03:13:23.777]  Let's play a few more of these clips.
[03:13:24.197 --> 03:13:30.262]  Let's get to something, because I haven't mentioned these, and like get off the whole drag the white people out of their cars, and the media acts like this is a good thing.
[03:13:31.183 --> 03:13:34.586]  Again, just to further stir it up, let's talk about Gary Johnson.
[03:13:34.646 --> 03:13:36.347]  Quote, I would sign the TPP.
[03:13:36.748 --> 03:13:41.512]  Now I've had Gary Johnson in studio over the years, let's not exaggerate, probably 10 times.
[03:13:42.112 --> 03:13:46.976]  I've known Gary Johnson for, since he was governor of New Mexico, probably 15 years.
[03:13:48.723 --> 03:13:51.304]  And he used to kind of be a real person when you'd meet him and stuff.
[03:13:51.324 --> 03:13:53.905]  The last four or five times I met him, he was like a robot.
[03:13:54.105 --> 03:13:55.565]  I've never met anybody like this in my life.
[03:13:56.086 --> 03:13:57.346]  And he'd be here, and I'm like, well, thanks for being here.
[03:13:57.366 --> 03:13:58.266]  He'd go, thank you, Alex.
[03:13:58.286 --> 03:13:58.847]  Good to see you.
[03:13:58.867 --> 03:13:59.767]  And he'd have his son with him.
[03:13:59.787 --> 03:14:00.707]  He, like, runs his campaign.
[03:14:00.727 --> 03:14:01.507]  You know, good-looking guy.
[03:14:01.527 --> 03:14:03.128]  You know, almost middle-aged, whatever.
[03:14:03.148 --> 03:14:04.388]  But the point is, it'd be him and his son.
[03:14:04.629 --> 03:14:05.509]  They'd be like, well, how's it going?
[03:14:06.129 --> 03:14:06.790]  Great, I'll see you later.
[03:14:06.810 --> 03:14:11.593]  It was just really, the son was like, kinda, I picked up this was an enemy camp.
[03:14:11.853 --> 03:14:12.033]  Yeah.
[03:14:12.273 --> 03:14:15.616]  And that he was just shielding himself to like have no emotion.
[03:14:15.816 --> 03:14:16.156]  Thank you!
[03:14:16.236 --> 03:14:16.676]  Good to see you!
[03:14:16.977 --> 03:14:20.679]  Now I don't mean to be mean about that, but he's been in this studio.
[03:14:20.699 --> 03:14:21.300]  What do you make of that?
[03:14:21.860 --> 03:14:27.105]  Well, you know, the Libertarians under his leadership have just gone off the deep end.
[03:14:27.486 --> 03:14:28.106]  It's extraordinary.
[03:14:28.486 --> 03:14:38.016]  You know, what people need to understand about the TPP is that there is a panel of judges that will
[03:14:38.755 --> 03:14:52.087]  We see cases where corporations who have been damaged by sovereign laws of states in this panel will make a decision whether a company has lost profits.
[03:14:52.707 --> 03:14:55.389]  And that panel will make the decision on how much that profit is.
[03:14:55.990 --> 03:15:00.434]  There's no right to appeal to sovereignty to your own country.
[03:15:00.934 --> 03:15:08.781]  If they find that you've damaged the country by a law in Texas that prevents GMO, for example, which isn't likely to happen anytime soon.
[03:15:09.181 --> 03:15:10.962]  Point is, it cedes control to foreign groups.
[03:15:11.943 --> 03:15:12.684]  Yeah.
[03:15:12.964 --> 03:15:15.346]  It overrides sovereignty.
[03:15:15.786 --> 03:15:23.032]  And how can the Libertarians support a trade agreement that overrides the sovereignty of individual nations?
[03:15:23.052 --> 03:15:27.356]  How do you support open borders if Mexico doesn't pay for anchor babies, but we do?
[03:15:27.456 --> 03:15:28.257]  It's not fair!
[03:15:29.077 --> 03:15:32.602]  We wouldn't have basically anybody bad immigrating here if we didn't have any welfare.
[03:15:34.645 --> 03:15:36.788]  You know, I used to think of myself as a libertarian.
[03:15:37.429 --> 03:15:38.931]  I used to too, not anymore.
[03:15:39.511 --> 03:15:40.533]  Not since Gary Johnson.
[03:15:43.410 --> 03:15:43.890]  It's a joke.
[03:15:43.970 --> 03:15:47.212]  Oh, and by the way, I've always been for decriminalization because I don't like the drug war.
[03:15:47.412 --> 03:15:47.512]  Yeah.
[03:15:47.532 --> 03:15:48.812]  That doesn't mean I love the drug culture.
[03:15:49.212 --> 03:15:57.516]  All they've done with this marijuana legalization is keep the feds where they bust you, have money at the state level, and then put everybody in a database that smoke and pot and basically take your kids.
[03:15:57.776 --> 03:15:57.936]  Yeah.
[03:15:58.156 --> 03:15:59.797]  I mean, they're basically just institutionalized.
[03:15:59.817 --> 03:16:02.918]  And this new marijuana, and I've said this before, I've never liked pot in my life.
[03:16:03.658 --> 03:16:05.979]  I'm not saying that to say, you know, I'm an anti-drug guy.
[03:16:05.999 --> 03:16:07.880]  I just don't like it.
[03:16:09.016 --> 03:16:12.397]  Alcohol's my issue, and I've always had an issue with it, and I like it.
[03:16:12.457 --> 03:16:13.238]  I mean, I won't lie.
[03:16:14.258 --> 03:16:19.140]  But I don't like stimulants, and I don't like, you know, stuff like marijuana that's in the hallucination class.
[03:16:19.540 --> 03:16:26.823]  But I, once a year or so, will be at an event, a party out in L.A., and there's some marijuana, and I want to know what it's like.
[03:16:27.483 --> 03:16:33.326]  I won't even do it anymore, because I smoked some about a year and a half ago, and couldn't get out of a chair for three hours.
[03:16:33.406 --> 03:16:33.746]  And folks,
[03:16:34.446 --> 03:16:38.950]  I don't do this anymore, but I can drink, you know, an entire jug of Jack Daniels and you won't even think I'm drunk.
[03:16:39.491 --> 03:16:46.897]  Ladies and gentlemen, this marijuana is so weaponized now, and they've genetically engineered a lot of it, this is coming out, that I'm telling you, you better watch out.
[03:16:47.057 --> 03:16:49.679]  Marijuana is seriously dangerous now.
[03:16:49.900 --> 03:16:51.381]  And I'm not saying put people in jail for it.
[03:16:51.881 --> 03:16:52.582]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:16:52.602 --> 03:16:53.142]  Let's be clear.
[03:16:53.443 --> 03:16:54.904]  But I want to put this out here.
[03:16:55.444 --> 03:16:58.367]  Marijuana now, the stuff going out there, is weaponized.
[03:16:58.807 --> 03:16:59.008]  Yeah.
[03:16:59.670 --> 03:17:01.474]  You know, I'm with you on the drug war.
[03:17:01.715 --> 03:17:07.207]  It's by design to acquire control, give control over to the government.
[03:17:10.318 --> 03:17:11.859]  It's been very, very successful with that.
[03:17:12.340 --> 03:17:12.780]  I agree.
[03:17:12.840 --> 03:17:21.506]  We need, and I have a lot of friends who will disagree with me on this, we need to do away with these drug laws because all they have done is give power to the government.
[03:17:21.566 --> 03:17:23.867]  But that doesn't mean we endorse the drugs.
[03:17:23.907 --> 03:17:27.169]  But here's the thing, Soros again involved the legalization, the pushing.
[03:17:27.450 --> 03:17:32.913]  Just because we're against putting everybody in prison doesn't mean we endorse the whole have three-year-olds smoke pot.
[03:17:33.334 --> 03:17:33.534]  Yeah.
[03:17:33.874 --> 03:17:36.716]  Especially when grown men can't get out of chairs when they smoke it.
[03:17:37.136 --> 03:17:38.237]  Yeah.
[03:17:38.297 --> 03:17:39.818]  I've observed the same thing.
[03:17:41.219 --> 03:17:42.481]  It's a dangerous thing right now.
[03:17:42.941 --> 03:17:48.145]  It's funny, I found myself agreeing with MoveOn.org over a few things.
[03:17:48.305 --> 03:17:49.206]  Now, is that spooky?
[03:17:49.687 --> 03:17:51.588]  Well, they've got to have a few issues that make sense.
[03:17:52.049 --> 03:17:52.649]  Yeah.
[03:17:53.270 --> 03:18:02.938]  So, if it comes to freedom and personal responsibility, that's really where I go with this whole thing.
[03:18:03.298 --> 03:18:04.039]  At the end of the day,
[03:18:04.659 --> 03:18:10.684]  You know, if you're not responsible for yourself, someone or some other thing will assume responsibility.
[03:18:10.704 --> 03:18:11.164]  Well, sure.
[03:18:11.364 --> 03:18:15.107]  I mean, I remember being in high school and smoking some pot and it kind of, you felt a little bit.
[03:18:17.605 --> 03:18:22.587]  But, I mean, the stuff now, I'm just saying, it is, it is, it is like a mule kicks you in the head.
[03:18:23.168 --> 03:18:28.390]  I mean, I don't know what they've done with the pot or whatever it is, because I'm not saying, oh, I smoke it once a year to test it like I'm a cop.
[03:18:28.430 --> 03:18:30.691]  No, I literally do, so I can be up to speed.
[03:18:31.172 --> 03:18:32.712]  And I'm telling you, I don't know what they've done to it, man.
[03:18:32.752 --> 03:18:33.533]  It is strong, Gary.
[03:18:33.733 --> 03:18:38.995]  Well, you know, it's consistent with 25% of the American population are on psychotropic drugs.
[03:18:39.155 --> 03:18:39.556]  Same thing.
[03:18:40.296 --> 03:18:44.018]  Yeah, so they're just... I mean, I'm very anti-drugs when I'm getting it.
[03:18:44.098 --> 03:18:45.859]  Yeah, yeah, and I am too.
[03:18:45.939 --> 03:18:47.800]  If I don't want to lock somebody up, they can call a Prozac.
[03:18:48.100 --> 03:18:48.240]  Yeah.
[03:18:48.840 --> 03:18:57.124]  I read a study just two days ago that 75% of the people that are on antidepressant drugs are not depressed.
[03:18:58.445 --> 03:19:03.588]  So... I know people that go in for back surgery and they go, oh, would you like a prescription antidepressant?
[03:19:03.628 --> 03:19:06.529]  And they'll just write there, oh, we've got a psychologist right here.
[03:19:06.549 --> 03:19:08.250]  They come right in and just, oh, here's your...
[03:19:08.513 --> 03:19:09.074]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:19:09.094 --> 03:19:10.116]  If you're sad, you gotta do it.
[03:19:10.156 --> 03:19:13.782]  I went in for my 40th checkup a few years ago, and the guy was a nice doctor.
[03:19:13.802 --> 03:19:15.364]  He was like, hey, you want a script for Viagra?
[03:19:15.384 --> 03:19:16.105]  You want a script for this?
[03:19:16.145 --> 03:19:18.289]  You want a script for... I was like, do you do this for everybody?
[03:19:18.309 --> 03:19:18.950]  Oh yeah, that's what we do.
[03:19:19.310 --> 03:19:20.472]  They were just trying to give me scripts.
[03:19:21.365 --> 03:19:22.706]  I was like, did you get to Vagra?
[03:19:22.866 --> 03:19:23.187]  I did.
[03:19:23.367 --> 03:19:23.647]  I did.
[03:19:24.228 --> 03:19:25.228]  I've never taken any.
[03:19:28.591 --> 03:19:30.793]  You know, all it made me do was see blurred vision.
[03:19:30.833 --> 03:19:31.294]  I didn't like it.
[03:19:32.535 --> 03:19:33.796]  I think I was already doing okay.
[03:19:33.876 --> 03:19:36.999]  I think I was doing a little too good then.
[03:19:37.839 --> 03:19:38.460]  No, I mean, I did.
[03:19:38.560 --> 03:19:38.800]  I did.
[03:19:38.940 --> 03:19:39.120]  I did.
[03:19:40.580 --> 03:19:43.001]  And I'll tell you what's crazy, though.
[03:19:43.021 --> 03:19:43.721]  This is a pitch.
[03:19:44.621 --> 03:19:48.723]  Speaking of the devil, I'm going to skip this break, too.
[03:19:48.763 --> 03:19:49.223]  I went in.
[03:19:49.283 --> 03:19:51.024]  He's this great doctor that took all this blood work.
[03:19:51.184 --> 03:19:53.345]  He goes, you ever had a checkup in 20-something years?
[03:19:53.405 --> 03:19:53.785]  I said, no.
[03:19:54.858 --> 03:19:56.399]  They reattached my finger 10 years ago.
[03:19:56.440 --> 03:19:57.420]  That's my only doctor's visit.
[03:19:57.440 --> 03:19:58.481]  He goes, well, blah, blah, blah.
[03:19:58.521 --> 03:19:59.562]  And so they took all this blood.
[03:19:59.603 --> 03:20:02.485]  I came back a month later and they had all these computer diagrams and the blood work and everything.
[03:20:02.505 --> 03:20:03.186]  It's all high tech now.
[03:20:03.206 --> 03:20:04.287]  He's one of the top guys in Austin.
[03:20:04.307 --> 03:20:04.807]  Real nice guy.
[03:20:05.048 --> 03:20:05.848]  And he turned out he was a listener.
[03:20:06.469 --> 03:20:07.450]  And so he was just being friendly.
[03:20:07.490 --> 03:20:10.613]  But I think he gave me Cialis and that.
[03:20:10.653 --> 03:20:11.714]  So I kind of got both.
[03:20:12.715 --> 03:20:14.597]  And then I just took it just to see.
[03:20:14.657 --> 03:20:15.678]  And it was like, eh.
[03:20:17.163 --> 03:20:18.924]  And I think it's almost like placebo or something.
[03:20:18.944 --> 03:20:19.825]  And I'm not knocking these things.
[03:20:19.865 --> 03:20:20.986]  I'm sure for somebody it's working great.
[03:20:21.706 --> 03:20:22.667]  But I didn't see any difference.
[03:20:22.767 --> 03:20:32.954]  But when I started taking Supramel Vitality, that's what God gave us, all these herbs that block the estrogen mimickers and stuff, we don't advertise Supramel Vitality as for that or Anthroplex.
[03:20:33.715 --> 03:20:37.638]  But absolutely, I mean, within one day of taking it, I noticed the difference.
[03:20:38.038 --> 03:20:40.400]  And that shows what God's given us versus what, you know,
[03:20:41.186 --> 03:20:43.488]  Yeah, and by the way, I take that as well.
[03:20:45.169 --> 03:20:48.112]  People need to go on your website, and they need to study your product.
[03:20:48.132 --> 03:20:49.593]  I didn't even know that, so be honest with me.
[03:20:49.633 --> 03:20:51.995]  I've got a real review, and I know you won't give me a fake one.
[03:20:52.035 --> 03:20:57.720]  Gary Haven, maker of Amerageddon, what nutraceuticals amount have you taken, and what did you think of them?
[03:20:57.740 --> 03:20:58.481]  The Super Vitality.
[03:20:58.501 --> 03:21:02.985]  And keep in mind, I have a degree in nutrition, and I've written two New York Times bestsellers.
[03:21:03.005 --> 03:21:04.546]  And you're one of the top supplement makers before.
[03:21:04.566 --> 03:21:05.647]  I mean, I even produced a business.
[03:21:05.667 --> 03:21:05.947]  That's right.
[03:21:05.967 --> 03:21:06.768]  I forgot that, that's right.
[03:21:07.248 --> 03:21:08.229]  How can I remember all this?
[03:21:09.510 --> 03:21:12.111]  No, great products, well researched, very effective.
[03:21:12.491 --> 03:21:19.233]  I recommend people go to your store and take advantage of the work you've done to create products.
[03:21:19.253 --> 03:21:19.793]  Let's be clear.
[03:21:19.853 --> 03:21:22.794]  I went out and got the top people and said, I know I'm going to be an FDA target.
[03:21:23.254 --> 03:21:28.916]  I want the absolute cleanest, best stuff, and I don't want to market up five to seven times like the average person.
[03:21:29.196 --> 03:21:31.497]  I want to put really expensive stuff in and market up 100%.
[03:21:32.037 --> 03:21:33.157]  That's our policy.
[03:21:33.417 --> 03:21:34.458]  You still have to pay for stuff with 100% markup.
[03:21:35.438 --> 03:21:36.239]  Yeah, that's reasonable.
[03:21:38.222 --> 03:21:39.784]  Anyway, I certainly endorse your products.
[03:21:40.325 --> 03:21:42.248]  You want to go back to the movie for a minute?
[03:21:42.268 --> 03:21:48.396]  Let's talk about Amerigeddon, which is available at Infowarsstore.com exclusively right now for the next week or so.
[03:21:48.697 --> 03:21:51.180]  You get two copies and you get two free films with it.
[03:21:51.641 --> 03:21:54.202]  Yeah, and this is an important movie because it's fact-based.
[03:21:55.063 --> 03:22:01.465]  We tell a story about an EMP attack, an electromagnetic pulse attack on America, that shuts down the grid.
[03:22:01.986 --> 03:22:08.209]  And our Congress has warned that if this were to happen, 90% of the American population would die in 12 months.
[03:22:09.409 --> 03:22:16.472]  And so we're talking about the globalists and to quote Henry Kissinger, the only thing standing in the way of a new world order is a strong America.
[03:22:17.112 --> 03:22:25.035]  One of the ways that they can diminish America quickly and severely is to allow for an EMP attack on this country.
[03:22:25.575 --> 03:22:28.476]  And in light of the events and things that are happening,
[03:22:29.616 --> 03:22:31.638]  I'm afraid this is a very likely scenario.
[03:22:31.678 --> 03:22:32.699]  So I made a movie about it.
[03:22:32.719 --> 03:22:35.181]  It's an entertaining movie, but it's fact-based.
[03:22:35.682 --> 03:22:45.190]  Everything from the National Defense Authorization Act, Executive Order 13603, the globalist movement... But isn't a Carrington event even more likely?
[03:22:45.230 --> 03:22:46.631]  I mean, this is going to happen.
[03:22:47.216 --> 03:22:57.139]  Yeah, I think the current event now is, what was it, 10% over 10 years or something, which is pretty significant.
[03:22:57.519 --> 03:23:03.661]  But you know, we've got North Korea flying a satellite over our country twice a day that very likely is weaponized.
[03:23:04.061 --> 03:23:06.622]  And so I kind of put that as a higher event right now.
[03:23:07.162 --> 03:23:09.903]  You know, I talked to Dr. Peter Prye, who's probably been on your program.
[03:23:10.504 --> 03:23:11.965]  He's the foremost expert on this.
[03:23:12.005 --> 03:23:17.247]  He's with Homeland Security Watch on EMP.
[03:23:17.888 --> 03:23:22.610]  And I asked him just recently... Oh, I talk to a lot of Pentagon high-ups and they say, no, this EMP thing's a real issue.
[03:23:23.050 --> 03:23:29.053]  Well, when I asked Dr. Prye, I said, what's the chances that there's a nuclear weapon on this satellite that crosses our country twice a day?
[03:23:29.494 --> 03:23:30.794]  And his answer was fascinating.
[03:23:30.814 --> 03:23:31.915]  He said to me,
[03:23:33.826 --> 03:23:35.867]  I can't believe they don't destroy it.
[03:23:36.127 --> 03:23:38.268]  I can't believe they don't destroy it.
[03:23:38.808 --> 03:23:44.671]  So, he strongly believes that twice a day, we're at risk for a satellite.
[03:23:44.691 --> 03:23:46.952]  With that little goblin in control of it?
[03:23:47.292 --> 03:23:49.913]  Yeah, and of course the goblin's not really in control.
[03:23:49.933 --> 03:23:50.954]  You know, he's the puppet.
[03:23:52.234 --> 03:23:52.574]  Chinese.
[03:23:52.975 --> 03:23:58.677]  If we wanted, Chinese and Russia, and probably the elitists that control this whole thing.
[03:23:58.737 --> 03:24:00.818]  You know, there's several groups of elitists.
[03:24:01.278 --> 03:24:08.100]  We haven't quite figured out who's in charge where, but they certainly are the ones that hold the fate of America in their hands.
[03:24:09.141 --> 03:24:15.543]  Wow, well all I know is it's a great film, it's powerful, it's great to show young people, especially churches.
[03:24:16.403 --> 03:24:17.824]  What do folks want to show to their church?
[03:24:18.764 --> 03:24:21.886]  Well, buy a copy and feel free to show it in a public environment.
[03:24:21.906 --> 03:24:23.007]  We want people to see it.
[03:24:23.047 --> 03:24:29.491]  I'm not knocking Mel Gibson out or any of these other folks, but they would make people pay a license fee and charge for tickets and pay him and he'd have representatives there.
[03:24:29.511 --> 03:24:33.754]  That's, again, Gary Heyman did not need to make this film.
[03:24:33.794 --> 03:24:35.895]  He did not need to make a pretty big budget film.
[03:24:36.396 --> 03:24:37.757]  I mean, I'm just guessing watching it.
[03:24:37.777 --> 03:24:39.158]  I don't know what you spent, I mean...
[03:24:40.336 --> 03:24:40.856]  Five million?
[03:24:40.896 --> 03:24:41.316]  Eight million?
[03:24:41.356 --> 03:24:42.456]  I mean, how much did you spend on this?
[03:24:42.716 --> 03:24:43.877]  You haven't told me before.
[03:24:43.897 --> 03:24:50.178]  Yeah, you know, I've never said it publicly, but we're getting, with the cost of distribution, we're getting close to the five million number.
[03:24:50.238 --> 03:24:51.598]  I knew it was high budget.
[03:24:51.718 --> 03:24:51.878]  Yeah.
[03:24:51.938 --> 03:24:54.059]  I mean, for some fact, I thought it was like ten million.
[03:24:54.099 --> 03:24:54.539]  It looks so good.
[03:24:54.699 --> 03:24:54.919]  It does.
[03:24:54.959 --> 03:24:57.999]  I saw those big crews and all the rest of it, all the ads and the rest of it.
[03:24:58.199 --> 03:24:58.959]  So five million.
[03:24:59.700 --> 03:25:01.340]  You're not, you did this to reach people.
[03:25:01.740 --> 03:25:01.900]  Yeah.
[03:25:02.020 --> 03:25:04.920]  And if folks don't, are we going to save the world with this film?
[03:25:04.980 --> 03:25:05.141]  No.
[03:25:05.181 --> 03:25:06.261]  Am I going to save the world next week?
[03:25:06.301 --> 03:25:06.381]  No.
[03:25:08.376 --> 03:25:11.920]  Might be that Secret Service agent that gives us info that tips the final domino.
[03:25:12.201 --> 03:25:12.941]  We're hitting them enough.
[03:25:12.982 --> 03:25:14.103]  We're going to see some big effects.
[03:25:14.123 --> 03:25:14.784]  We already are.
[03:25:15.585 --> 03:25:17.707]  And so, you need to get this film.
[03:25:17.947 --> 03:25:19.109]  Every listener needs to get it.
[03:25:19.189 --> 03:25:21.512]  You need to show it to friends and family.
[03:25:21.532 --> 03:25:24.716]  And the fact that he's right here, you know, saying, show it to your church.
[03:25:25.216 --> 03:25:25.577]  Show it.
[03:25:25.897 --> 03:25:27.379]  What if folks want to put it on AXS television?
[03:25:28.376 --> 03:25:31.857]  Well, let's get some more momentum from it.
[03:25:32.077 --> 03:25:36.499]  I agree, because if you agree to that, then you might not get bigger TV rights, and you want to put it on bigger TV.
[03:25:36.579 --> 03:25:39.560]  I understand because I've been involved with this myself.
[03:25:39.860 --> 03:25:42.700]  Give folks some TV rights, it nixes out big ones to put it out to millions.
[03:25:43.021 --> 03:25:43.581]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:25:43.901 --> 03:25:45.581]  And when could we see this on TV then?
[03:25:45.601 --> 03:25:47.502]  Because I know there's some plans for that.
[03:25:47.582 --> 03:25:49.062]  Probably towards the end of the year.
[03:25:49.423 --> 03:25:53.164]  We're going to have evolved to that level.
[03:25:53.304 --> 03:25:56.385]  So, film, theaters, DVD, and then TV.
[03:25:57.365 --> 03:25:57.526]  Yep.
[03:25:57.886 --> 03:26:00.230]  In fact, it's showing at theaters across the country right now.
[03:26:00.311 --> 03:26:03.616]  So go to the Americanmovie.com website.
[03:26:03.636 --> 03:26:04.658]  I should have mentioned that more.
[03:26:04.678 --> 03:26:05.600]  I mentioned it earlier on.
[03:26:05.620 --> 03:26:07.643]  In fact, give folks that URL again.
[03:26:08.527 --> 03:26:14.412]  Go to MerriganTheMovie.com and click on the theaters and it'll show you where it's showing around the country.
[03:26:14.492 --> 03:26:16.234]  It's even better to go to the theaters to see it.
[03:26:16.254 --> 03:26:17.895]  You know, it's a better production of it.
[03:26:18.976 --> 03:26:21.458]  And I tell you, you want to bring your friends to see this thing.
[03:26:21.859 --> 03:26:26.323]  Especially those friends that are in doubt over this whole thing.
[03:26:26.823 --> 03:26:29.966]  Because we depict a real scenario that's fact-based.
[03:26:30.747 --> 03:26:34.230]  We also show you how to prepare for this and how to survive after it happens.
[03:26:34.690 --> 03:26:35.551]  And let's add to that.
[03:26:36.840 --> 03:26:43.462]  People are getting the director's cut that is even bigger than what you see in theaters, and so this is the first look director's cut.
[03:26:43.602 --> 03:26:44.842]  Yeah, thanks for reminding me of that.
[03:26:45.142 --> 03:26:46.942]  It's a director's cut with different content.
[03:26:47.022 --> 03:27:00.026]  You know, Hollywood has tried to diminish the final edit on this thing, but what Alex has available here at his website this week is everything.
[03:27:00.146 --> 03:27:01.086]  The most hardcore version.
[03:27:02.046 --> 03:27:07.952]  So, this is a great place to acquire the movie and then to show it to your friends and family and even your churches.
[03:27:08.472 --> 03:27:13.617]  Fox and Friends said, ultimate political thriller, all Americans should prepare for this type of situation.
[03:27:13.657 --> 03:27:14.237]  Fox and Friends.
[03:27:15.253 --> 03:27:16.894]  What happens when the government turns against you?
[03:27:17.915 --> 03:27:19.796]  This is totally going against the grain right here.
[03:27:20.076 --> 03:27:20.296]  Yeah.
[03:27:20.757 --> 03:27:22.958]  You know, there were two purposes of this movie.
[03:27:23.158 --> 03:27:27.281]  One was to really show people the threat that exists to our survival as a country.
[03:27:27.782 --> 03:27:34.146]  The other one, which is the one that's probably put me at greater risk, is that this is by design.
[03:27:34.326 --> 03:27:39.910]  That the people in power, and it's not just the Democrats, you know, we pretty much know that they're giving over to communism and
[03:27:40.970 --> 03:27:41.671]  We're good to go.
[03:27:58.982 --> 03:28:19.711]  That's right, you can get one copy of the film Amerageddon on DVD at Infowarsstore.com exclusively right now, or get a second copy, two copies for $39.90 and get my first film, America Destroyed by Design, and then one of my latest, most powerful films, Fall of the Republic, that breaks down everything currently happening.
[03:28:20.876 --> 03:28:21.156]  Free.
[03:28:21.416 --> 03:28:24.718]  Two films free when you purchase two Amerageddons.
[03:28:25.058 --> 03:28:28.780]  And I'm doing that because I want to get this film out.
[03:28:29.060 --> 03:28:32.822]  Another big thing people can do if you really want to reach a lot of people, get two copies.
[03:28:32.842 --> 03:28:34.423]  Keep one for your own archive to share.
[03:28:34.764 --> 03:28:36.665]  Take the other and donate it to the library.
[03:28:37.145 --> 03:28:40.747]  So many people are smart because they've closed all the video stores.
[03:28:40.767 --> 03:28:42.648]  I was reading an article about this in the Wall Street Journal about a year ago.
[03:28:43.208 --> 03:28:51.915]  That what's the most popular now at libraries is not the books anymore, but is people going and actually checking out the DVDs, the Blu-rays, all that.
[03:28:52.396 --> 03:29:00.843]  And so that's why you make a donation of this to your library, you're going to talk about hundreds of people that are going to check that out and watch it.
[03:29:02.338 --> 03:29:03.258]  That is amazing.
[03:29:03.619 --> 03:29:04.139]  All of that.
[03:29:04.199 --> 03:29:20.006]  I can't tell you how many listeners we run into on the street that found this show, not on a local M or FM station, but over the internet over the years, because somebody gave them a DVD or somebody gave them a card with ForbiddenInformationInfoWars.com or they saw a bumper sticker and it's just exponential.
[03:29:20.106 --> 03:29:20.647]  It's exponential.
[03:29:21.147 --> 03:29:25.069]  I can't imagine where InfoWars will be in a year, two years, three years.
[03:29:25.830 --> 03:29:30.278]  Uh, and I just pray to God that I can be humble and focus and make the right decisions with this great responsibility.
[03:29:30.318 --> 03:29:31.580]  But it's not just Alex Jones.
[03:29:31.861 --> 03:29:32.762]  It's what Gary Haven's doing.
[03:29:32.782 --> 03:29:33.684]  It's what Matt Drudge is doing.
[03:29:33.704 --> 03:29:34.706]  It's what WorldNetDaily is doing.
[03:29:34.766 --> 03:29:35.006]  It's what...
[03:29:36.658 --> 03:29:38.320]  People like Donald Trump are doing.
[03:29:38.720 --> 03:29:42.144]  We all are just choosing to not be with the New World Order.
[03:29:42.504 --> 03:29:46.969]  And speaking of somebody who's choosing to do that, Roger Stone joining us.
[03:29:47.029 --> 03:29:47.950]  He's clamoring to get on.
[03:29:47.970 --> 03:29:48.490]  Never does that.
[03:29:48.530 --> 03:29:49.592]  I tried to get him on the show.
[03:29:49.612 --> 03:29:50.232]  He's a busy guy.
[03:29:50.553 --> 03:29:55.398]  He says he's got big news you need to know about right now coming up straight ahead.
[03:29:55.418 --> 03:29:56.379]  We need to tweet that out too.
[03:29:56.419 --> 03:29:56.919]  This is big.
[03:29:57.220 --> 03:29:59.101]  Stay with us, former Trump campaign head.
[03:30:00.086 --> 03:30:00.987]  We're on the march.
[03:30:01.487 --> 03:30:03.089]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:04.010 --> 03:30:06.812]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.996 --> 03:30:12.017]  Brain Force is here.
[03:30:12.557 --> 03:30:14.839]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:30:15.100 --> 03:30:22.907]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[03:30:23.686 --> 03:30:26.829]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[03:30:27.129 --> 03:30:27.269]  Right?
[03:30:27.289 --> 03:30:29.631]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[03:30:29.991 --> 03:30:33.514]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:30:33.554 --> 03:30:36.697]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:30:37.197 --> 03:30:42.381]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[03:30:42.521 --> 03:30:44.363]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[03:30:44.723 --> 03:30:49.147]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[03:30:49.307 --> 03:30:51.308]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[03:30:51.929 --> 03:30:53.410]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[03:30:53.530 --> 03:30:53.790]  Exactly.
[03:30:53.810 --> 03:30:57.634]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[03:30:58.094 --> 03:31:06.081]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:31:10.928 --> 03:31:18.051]  Donald Trump slammed the New York Times as a failing media enterprise on Sunday after it published two hit pieces against him mirroring the Clinton campaign's talking points.
[03:31:18.291 --> 03:31:29.756]  As reported by Steve Watson, the first New York Times piece, headlined, Inside the Failing Mission to Tame Trump's Tongue, insinuated that anonymous sources inside Trump's campaign claim that he is perpetually sullen and erratic.
[03:31:29.936 --> 03:31:35.679]  The Times said, quote, The smear piece also claimed that Trump grooves about his souring relationship with the news media.
[03:31:35.919 --> 03:31:39.743]  Do you really believe Trump raves about what the discredited, failing media thinks about him?
[03:31:39.863 --> 03:31:44.967]  Remember, he started attacking the media as state-run propaganda not long after he entered the race last year.
[03:31:45.167 --> 03:31:54.396]  And the second hit piece, which is barely worth mentioning, claimed that Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort has intimate ties with, quote, politically corrupt pro-Kremlin elements in Ukraine.
[03:31:54.476 --> 03:32:02.103]  You mean the same Ukraine that was overthrown by George Soros and Western governments to geopolitically isolate Russia, one of the few countries not controlled by the global elite?
[03:32:02.543 --> 03:32:08.468]  And to find out more about the desperation of the New York Times and establishment media in general, visit InfoWars.com.
[03:32:08.648 --> 03:32:09.869]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[03:32:10.720 --> 03:32:16.882]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[03:32:17.263 --> 03:32:20.144]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[03:32:20.484 --> 03:32:25.666]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[03:32:26.086 --> 03:32:32.068]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[03:32:32.208 --> 03:32:35.329]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[03:32:35.489 --> 03:32:36.930]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[03:32:37.150 --> 03:32:41.292]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[03:32:41.472 --> 03:32:44.353]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[03:32:44.413 --> 03:32:45.994]  It works like an antioxidant.
[03:32:46.094 --> 03:32:49.276]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[03:32:49.556 --> 03:32:51.877]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[03:32:52.157 --> 03:32:53.117]  It's in powder form.
[03:32:53.217 --> 03:32:55.919]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[03:32:56.099 --> 03:32:57.119]  I take this.
[03:32:57.219 --> 03:32:58.500]  This is the product that I take.
[03:32:58.620 --> 03:33:00.581]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[03:33:01.421 --> 03:33:02.182]  We fight the Globos.
[03:33:02.222 --> 03:33:03.044]  We fight the New World Order.

[03:33:23.664 --> 03:33:31.129]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:33:32.170 --> 03:33:36.073]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:36.513 --> 03:33:40.276]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:33:40.696 --> 03:33:42.297]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:43.278 --> 03:33:50.103]  Well, it's serendipitous that Mr. Haven is here with us, the producer and star of Amerageddon.
[03:33:51.533 --> 03:33:54.015]  And then we also have Mr. Stone here with us.
[03:33:54.495 --> 03:33:57.578]  Now, Mr. Stone, I'm normally clamoring to get him on the broadcast.
[03:33:57.618 --> 03:34:01.381]  Roger Stone, today, he's got stuff so important he wants on the broadcast.
[03:34:01.841 --> 03:34:05.464]  So I think I've seen him this animated in a while.
[03:34:05.504 --> 03:34:07.585]  He's still stone cold over there.
[03:34:07.605 --> 03:34:09.267]  But Roger Stone is our guest.
[03:34:09.287 --> 03:34:13.770]  Gary Haben is our guest until the end of the hour as well.
[03:34:14.571 --> 03:34:15.632]  So much going on.
[03:34:16.032 --> 03:34:18.494]  Trump coming out, organizing against election fraud.
[03:34:18.514 --> 03:34:20.936]  A lot of polls going back even with Hillary.
[03:34:21.816 --> 03:34:22.337]  Uh, Trump.
[03:34:52.397 --> 03:34:56.820]  And somebody who can really give us the inside scoop on what's happening.
[03:34:57.241 --> 03:35:00.423]  I know also the cover of the New York Times this morning as I got up at 6 a.m.
[03:35:00.443 --> 03:35:00.964]  was reading it.
[03:35:01.564 --> 03:35:03.606]  Secret ledger in Ukraine's list.
[03:35:04.066 --> 03:35:06.048]  Cash for Donald Trump's campaign chief.
[03:35:06.468 --> 03:35:09.211]  I don't know what Roger's gonna stay here, but I've followed this closely.
[03:35:10.629 --> 03:35:13.970]  That's like saying, oh, we have a secret list of somebody that paid their electric bill.
[03:35:14.370 --> 03:35:25.894]  It's no secret that his business partner of decades, Mr. Manafort, has worked for the previous elected president of Ukraine.
[03:35:25.914 --> 03:35:34.997]  But they put this headline out and act like, oh, it's mysterious, oh, it's bad, to ignore all the admitted evidence of Hillary giving up one-fifth of the U.S.
[03:35:35.457 --> 03:35:36.698]  uranium supply
[03:35:37.458 --> 03:35:39.178]  To the Russians for $35 million.
[03:35:39.959 --> 03:35:41.379]  That's been in the Wall Street Journal.
[03:35:41.659 --> 03:35:47.541]  So there's...WikiLeaks has said no real connections in our hacks to Trump and the Russians.
[03:35:47.841 --> 03:35:52.782]  Hillary, it's amazing, but not as bad as the Chinese and the Saudi Arabians.
[03:35:52.842 --> 03:35:57.524]  So, joining us till the end of the transmission is Roger Stone of StoneZone.com.
[03:35:57.764 --> 03:35:58.604]  Good to have you, my friend.
[03:35:59.304 --> 03:36:00.405]  Great to be here, Alex.
[03:36:00.905 --> 03:36:05.167]  You kind of read my mind because this is precisely what I want to address.
[03:36:05.807 --> 03:36:07.768]  The New York Times should be ashamed of themselves.
[03:36:08.588 --> 03:36:22.174]  This story, if you read it carefully, indicates that Manafort is not the subject of an investigation, that there is no evidence of secret campaign or financial transfers to him.
[03:36:23.034 --> 03:36:24.175]  This is a nothing burger.
[03:36:25.035 --> 03:36:29.841]  All the news that's fit to print embellished with a Clinton tin.
[03:36:30.581 --> 03:36:31.963]  There's no story here.
[03:36:31.983 --> 03:36:34.266]  This was manufactured news.
[03:36:34.726 --> 03:36:42.875]  Now juxtapose that with the New York Times failure to delve into the current criminality at the Clinton Foundation.
[03:36:43.556 --> 03:36:55.223]  The Clintons have set up a Clinton Foundation Canada that is unregulated, where millions of dollars for Mr. Giustra, who purchased the uranium concession, have flowed.
[03:36:55.863 --> 03:36:58.365]  You know how much of that has been reported in the New York Times?
[03:36:59.449 --> 03:36:59.749]  None.
[03:37:00.489 --> 03:37:13.433]  So, this is a manufacturer, which I can reveal here, is done on the basis of research that was conducted in Ukraine by Sidney Blumenthal, using heavy-handed private detectives.
[03:37:13.854 --> 03:37:17.395]  They've dug for months on Manafort, and they have found nothing.
[03:37:17.695 --> 03:37:19.215]  There is no investigation.
[03:37:19.575 --> 03:37:21.136]  Manafort is not a target.
[03:37:21.716 --> 03:37:27.698]  The scrawled note that is in the headline tracks to no bank transfer records.
[03:37:28.098 --> 03:37:31.819]  There is no proof of any payment to Manafort.
[03:37:32.059 --> 03:37:33.499]  It's a canard.
[03:37:33.659 --> 03:37:41.181]  But expanding on that, he has been an international consultant to hundreds of different groups, and so I don't care if he's been a consultant to an elected government.
[03:37:41.601 --> 03:37:44.142]  It's George Soros running around overthrowing governments.
[03:37:44.802 --> 03:37:48.643]  And he has never worked for the Ukrainian government or for the Russian government.
[03:37:48.663 --> 03:37:49.243]  So he hasn't.
[03:37:50.322 --> 03:37:54.644]  As you point out, Alex, the whole involvement of Putin and the Russians is a canard.
[03:37:54.684 --> 03:37:55.784]  Let's be very clear.
[03:37:56.424 --> 03:38:06.888]  The DNC hacked emails involving the theft from Bernie Sanders and the role of Deborah Wasserman Schultz was hacked by Crucifer too.
[03:38:07.688 --> 03:38:10.450]  And posted online five weeks ago.
[03:38:10.930 --> 03:38:19.455]  When it got no traction, he took those documents to WikiLeaks, they put them out, and they received substantial traction.
[03:38:20.075 --> 03:38:23.837]  No involvement by the Russians, no involvement by Putin.
[03:38:25.218 --> 03:38:33.344]  The whole idea that Manafort and Trump are somehow aligned with Putin, working with Putin, this is a falsehood.
[03:38:54.798 --> 03:38:55.999]  I don't know how serious this is.
[03:38:56.979 --> 03:39:06.624]  Yeah, look, I think that her medical issues are yet another example of the New York Times shirking their responsibilities and essentially writing nothing.
[03:39:06.684 --> 03:39:09.426]  But isn't the New York Times owned by a Mexican kingpin now?
[03:39:09.506 --> 03:39:10.866]  I mean, let's get real here.
[03:39:11.287 --> 03:39:15.429]  No, it is owned by Carlos Slim, who is the largest single donor
[03:39:16.129 --> 03:39:19.692]  To the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative.
[03:39:20.092 --> 03:39:23.635]  That's who owns a controlling interest in the New York Times.
[03:39:24.055 --> 03:39:33.223]  Which is why you have this assault on Paul Manafort, which is really about attacking Trump, instead of any investigative journalism about the corruption of the Clintons.
[03:39:33.963 --> 03:39:47.027]  This is disgraceful, and frankly, I've never heard of the reporters whose names are on this story, but they should be ashamed of themselves, because they admit no government official says Manafort has been charged with wrongdoing in the story.
[03:39:47.327 --> 03:39:55.409]  He is not the subject of this- Well, why don't we just have an article saying that they found the yellow cake, Niger uranium, at Paul Manafort's house?
[03:39:56.226 --> 03:40:04.932]  Well, what's particularly disturbing about this is that within seconds of it being posted last night, it was tweeted online by Corey Lewandowski.
[03:40:05.412 --> 03:40:16.940]  So now I think it is fair to say that Lewandowski is in league with Sidney Blumenthal and the Clintons, and in this case, with the New York Times, to discredit... And he works with CNN.
[03:40:16.960 --> 03:40:17.820]  ...the Trump campaign.
[03:40:18.381 --> 03:40:19.562]  Divert the campaign.
[03:40:19.602 --> 03:40:20.022]  Pathetic.
[03:40:20.142 --> 03:40:20.983]  Really pathetic.
[03:40:21.003 --> 03:40:23.484]  So now, you used to tell me privately you thought Lewandowski was an idiot.
[03:40:23.744 --> 03:40:25.986]  You're saying now you think he's been an operative all along, or just now?
[03:40:26.786 --> 03:40:30.389]  Well, why would you do something detrimental to the Trump campaign?
[03:40:30.429 --> 03:40:33.691]  Why would you spread complete disinformation?
[03:40:34.331 --> 03:40:40.455]  Unless, of course, you're putting yourself ahead of Trump, which is what I think he has done in this instance.
[03:40:40.595 --> 03:40:43.637]  Look, Alex, as you know, late last week,
[03:40:45.398 --> 03:41:07.207]  Shortly after it became known on this program that I have had some back-channel communication with WikiLeaks and Julian Assange regarding the fact that everything that Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, the Clinton aides, thought that they erased on Hillary's illegal server is in the possession of WikiLeaks.
[03:41:07.887 --> 03:41:14.671]  Probably also the Chinese, the Russians, the Saudis and the Israelis, but most definitely in the hands of WikiLeaks.
[03:41:15.252 --> 03:41:17.353]  This is political dynamite.
[03:41:17.793 --> 03:41:21.396]  Shortly thereafter, as you know, I myself was hacked.
[03:41:22.236 --> 03:41:24.318]  It's far worse than I reported last week.
[03:41:24.698 --> 03:41:30.402]  My personal email accounts, my business email accounts, my bank account was accessed.
[03:41:30.962 --> 03:41:42.225]  My websites were accessed, my social media feeds were accessed, two of my associates who work with me, one based in Texas, one based in California, both hacked at the same time.
[03:41:42.245 --> 03:41:46.086]  So a total data scoop to find out who you're talking to.
[03:41:46.106 --> 03:41:48.747]  30 years worth of political contacts erased.
[03:41:49.287 --> 03:41:51.568]  Email contacts erased.
[03:41:51.608 --> 03:41:52.188]  Sabotage.
[03:41:52.608 --> 03:41:57.350]  Documents that I was working on, research I was working on, erased.
[03:41:57.470 --> 03:41:58.350]  Now fortunately,
[03:41:59.250 --> 03:42:08.376]  All of this is backed up in a server in New York, and therefore all they've done is make me more determined to bring them down and put me back about four or five days.
[03:42:08.836 --> 03:42:10.117]  Well, Trump's coming to town in a few weeks.
[03:42:10.157 --> 03:42:14.920]  I hope you'll come here so you and I can meet, obviously, here in Austin, get you down here, Roger.
[03:42:16.101 --> 03:42:26.808]  I've got Mr. Haben here, who was really looking forward to speaking to you sometime about things he wants to do, working with the campaign, and popping any questions you've got, because it's always great to have a wildcard question, Gary.
[03:42:27.328 --> 03:42:28.429]  But specifically,
[03:42:30.674 --> 03:42:38.680]  When he says, we know if we don't win Pennsylvania that we've been stolen, is that obviously because the internal polling shows he's ahead?
[03:42:38.700 --> 03:42:40.021]  He's having giant crowds.
[03:42:40.041 --> 03:42:41.302]  The Democrats say we're all for you.
[03:42:41.543 --> 03:42:43.744]  Most Democrats I talk to say they're for Trump.
[03:42:44.245 --> 03:42:45.846]  They see right through Hillary.
[03:42:46.206 --> 03:42:48.288]  She can't even get 176 people at her rallies now.
[03:42:48.628 --> 03:42:49.929]  He gets 30,000.
[03:42:50.410 --> 03:42:56.574]  I mean, it really seems like they're putting out these polls to create the hoax that he's behind so that people think he's going to lose.
[03:42:57.435 --> 03:42:59.737]  What's the real numbers right now, as best you can tell, Mr. Stone?
[03:43:00.296 --> 03:43:01.796]  I think you're exactly right, Alex.
[03:43:01.816 --> 03:43:13.559]  It was my intention today to publish a major paper on exactly how this election can be rigged and where exactly I expect it to happen.
[03:43:13.599 --> 03:43:17.360]  To be clear, both parties have been involved in machine rigging.
[03:43:17.900 --> 03:43:20.481]  It's the party in power in the given states.
[03:43:21.041 --> 03:43:28.126]  That will rig the machines and therefore Pennsylvania and Virginia are two states that must be monitored closely.
[03:43:28.166 --> 03:43:29.086]  What do I mean by that?
[03:43:29.166 --> 03:43:32.228]  Very simply, we need to conduct exit polls.
[03:43:32.969 --> 03:43:43.095]  So if the difference between the results, the official results from the machines and the exit polls are different, we will know that this election has been rigged.
[03:43:43.555 --> 03:43:44.596]  That has to be done.
[03:43:44.716 --> 03:43:47.438]  I'm going to unveil a plan shortly to do it.
[03:43:48.687 --> 03:43:52.237]  But the hacking of my email frankly put me behind a day or two.
[03:43:52.678 --> 03:43:55.305]  No big deal because the struggle continues.
[03:43:57.208 --> 03:44:02.892]  By the way, I don't think it's internal sabotage, but the link that they put is so hidden you can't even find it.
[03:44:02.912 --> 03:44:07.996]  It took us days to find the link on DonaldJTrump.com for volunteers to sign up for that.
[03:44:08.016 --> 03:44:16.202]  So we're sending out a mass email and we're going to post it in the next few minutes to InfoWars.com with the actual URL where people can go sign up.
[03:44:16.242 --> 03:44:17.043]  In fact, it's gone live.
[03:44:17.383 --> 03:44:20.025]  Share this link to help Trump stop rigged elections.
[03:44:20.345 --> 03:44:22.707]  Trump calls on Americans to become election observers.
[03:44:23.027 --> 03:44:24.148]  There's a video I shot
[03:44:24.588 --> 03:44:32.601]  Pointing out that for dinner with Trump or to donate to Trump or all this stuff is literally hidden and inaccessible by any link.
[03:44:32.681 --> 03:44:36.106]  It took data mining, Roger, to find this on the site.
[03:44:36.326 --> 03:44:37.729]  So I just want to let the campaign know about that.
[03:44:38.749 --> 03:44:42.630]  Yeah, I think it's going to be very important to have every polling place covered.
[03:44:43.330 --> 03:44:45.991]  And the Trump campaign is going to do some of that.
[03:44:46.131 --> 03:44:53.374]  Citizens for Trump, the fabulous grassroots organization that co-sponsored our rally in Cleveland, is going to do some of that.
[03:44:53.854 --> 03:44:59.035]  We're ramping up StopTheSteal.com again for this specific purpose.
[03:45:00.136 --> 03:45:02.656]  These machines can easily be hacked.
[03:45:03.217 --> 03:45:07.318]  It takes a $15 device that you can buy at Best Buy
[03:45:08.038 --> 03:45:10.042]  To allow you to vote multiple times.
[03:45:10.063 --> 03:45:11.746]  Sure, I mean the audience knows that.
[03:45:11.766 --> 03:45:15.334]  But I mean, why do you think Obama came out and flipped out and said, what's a rigged election?
[03:45:15.575 --> 03:45:18.200]  Didn't he put his foot in his mouth with that one?
[03:45:19.008 --> 03:45:20.529]  Well, he said it was ridiculous.
[03:45:20.549 --> 03:45:27.233]  You see, what they're trying to do is discredit any claim that this election is not honest up front.
[03:45:27.553 --> 03:45:35.437]  The fact that Obama says the entire concept of rigging the election is ridiculous convinces me all the more that they will attempt to do it.
[03:45:35.837 --> 03:45:38.139]  Well, they just tried to steal the nomination and did from Sanders.
[03:45:39.039 --> 03:45:40.200]  Gary, jump in here with some questions.
[03:45:40.220 --> 03:45:41.781]  You say there's a lot you want to ask Mr. Stone.
[03:45:42.461 --> 03:45:43.161]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:45:43.581 --> 03:45:45.062]  Hi Roger, good to see you.
[03:45:46.670 --> 03:45:47.591]  Connect here for a while.
[03:45:48.271 --> 03:45:56.118]  You know, you mentioned something really interesting with the Clinton Foundation, that it was first founded in Canada.
[03:45:56.879 --> 03:45:59.221]  And I wanted to add something to that.
[03:46:00.462 --> 03:46:05.606]  Canadian law allows that foundation in Canada to not reveal the donors.
[03:46:06.347 --> 03:46:08.749]  And then, of course, they transfer the money into the U.S.
[03:46:08.989 --> 03:46:10.350]  where it's safe from being revealed.
[03:46:10.390 --> 03:46:11.271]  So obviously criminal.
[03:46:11.291 --> 03:46:12.192]  If I did this, they'd arrest me.
[03:46:12.372 --> 03:46:14.312]  Yeah, it is so.
[03:46:14.733 --> 03:46:17.973]  Yes, they've done the exact same thing in a number of other jurisdictions.
[03:46:18.013 --> 03:46:22.114]  Look, the Clinton Foundation, Gary, as you know, is not a charitable organization.
[03:46:22.154 --> 03:46:23.675]  It's a slush fund for grifters.
[03:46:24.675 --> 03:46:32.837]  It is a vehicle for the facilitation of multi-million dollar bribes that were paid to the Clintons in return for governmental favors.
[03:46:33.277 --> 03:46:37.958]  The Russians paid, the Chinese paid, the Saudis paid, and they all got something.
[03:46:37.998 --> 03:46:38.818]  It's a classic case.
[03:46:38.838 --> 03:46:39.559]  Let me raise this.
[03:46:39.759 --> 03:46:40.799]  Why is the media
[03:46:41.519 --> 03:46:45.621]  I mean, if I thought there was a ceiling on hysteria, let's say that's a 10, they've now gone to a 30.
[03:46:45.861 --> 03:46:51.243]  I mean, it is end-of-the-world panic, run-around, just lying.
[03:46:51.323 --> 03:46:54.024]  I mean, it's got a backfire on them.
[03:46:54.044 --> 03:46:58.546]  I mean, are they panicking because they know Trump's really ahead in their own internal polling?
[03:46:58.706 --> 03:47:02.328]  Because if he was so far behind like they claim, they wouldn't be running around like it's the end of the world.
[03:47:03.302 --> 03:47:08.465]  No, I think they're panicking because they understand that should he be elected, it's the end of the old order.
[03:47:08.545 --> 03:47:10.966]  It's the end of the two-party duopoly.
[03:47:11.386 --> 03:47:14.208]  It's the end of the neocons controlling our government.
[03:47:14.688 --> 03:47:17.049]  It's the end of the erosion of our civil liberties.
[03:47:17.109 --> 03:47:20.471]  It's the end of debt and massive spending.
[03:47:20.551 --> 03:47:22.052]  It's the end of the new world order.
[03:47:22.112 --> 03:47:23.353]  That's what they said in the Washington Post.
[03:47:24.253 --> 03:47:27.495]  It's the end of bailouts on Wall Street for the crooks and swindlers.
[03:47:28.156 --> 03:47:41.765]  It would open up a whole new era of economic growth and prosperity as Trump trimmed regulations and formulated tax policy that would be job-friendly, job-creation friendly.
[03:47:42.105 --> 03:47:46.768]  So he challenges the two-party duopoly and 30 years of bad decisions.
[03:47:47.188 --> 03:47:58.144]  Sure, I want Gary to come in with some more questions, because I love the wild card, but other tidbits, Roger Stone, that folks should be aware of right now, what are you concerned about?
[03:47:59.531 --> 03:48:05.055]  Well, my number one concern, of course, is this effort by the mainstream media to call this election over in August.
[03:48:05.715 --> 03:48:15.402]  It's not even Labor Day, and you had this major New York Times piece that has the Trump campaign in disarray, the candidate dispirited.
[03:48:16.463 --> 03:48:18.424]  He's giving up, it's all over.
[03:48:18.444 --> 03:48:22.146]  This is like taking what happened with Ben Carson to the next level.
[03:48:22.447 --> 03:48:23.848]  I mean, shouldn't we make them...
[03:48:24.708 --> 03:48:26.751]  Make the point that they're staging a hoax here?
[03:48:27.411 --> 03:48:32.537]  Well, it's not only a hoax, but anybody who reads this stuff understands that that is not Trump.
[03:48:32.998 --> 03:48:33.939]  Trump is a fighter.
[03:48:34.300 --> 03:48:36.883]  Trump never quits things midstream.
[03:48:36.903 --> 03:48:38.084]  That's not him.
[03:48:38.184 --> 03:48:42.289]  He won this nomination in a hostile takeover of the Republican Party.
[03:48:42.489 --> 03:48:43.751]  He never settles lawsuits.
[03:48:43.791 --> 03:48:44.411]  He loves it.
[03:48:45.185 --> 03:48:46.046]  No, he's a fighter.
[03:48:46.106 --> 03:49:04.157]  So the idea that he is going to quit, that whole McGuffin, was first put out by the Republican National Committee, and then kind of picked up by the Clinton spin machine as a way to dampen the enthusiasm of both donors and volunteers.
[03:49:04.797 --> 03:49:06.658]  This election's far from over.
[03:49:07.059 --> 03:49:10.501]  You have a number of debates that are going to be pivotal.
[03:49:11.561 --> 03:49:18.146]  Donald Trump would like to see the minor party candidates, Jill Stein and Gary Johnson, in those debates.
[03:49:18.567 --> 03:49:21.489]  I predict Hillary will never agree to that.
[03:49:22.390 --> 03:49:30.736]  The Presidential Commission on Debates is not appointed by the President, is not a commission, and it's most definitely not about debate.
[03:49:30.776 --> 03:49:32.177]  It's about limiting debate.
[03:49:32.618 --> 03:49:35.980]  They will want these debates at a time that almost nobody can see them.
[03:49:36.441 --> 03:49:40.143]  They will want a format that will not allow Trump to cross-examine Hillary.
[03:49:41.124 --> 03:49:43.246]  She hasn't had a press conference in 250, what, 6, 57 days?
[03:49:43.486 --> 03:49:48.150]  I was about to say, she clearly can't even hardly stand up now.
[03:49:48.170 --> 03:49:51.192]  I was watching her today with Biden sitting there, she looked like she was about to die.
[03:49:51.533 --> 03:49:53.334]  How is she going to be in an hour and a half, two hour debate?
[03:49:53.374 --> 03:49:55.276]  I think Trump should push for as long as possible.
[03:49:56.357 --> 03:50:00.640]  And he should keep a list of all the questions she has failed to answer these many months.
[03:50:00.720 --> 03:50:04.684]  I can think of... Yeah, I would say, since you never had press conferences, let me ask you about Benghazi.
[03:50:04.944 --> 03:50:06.145]  Let me ask you about your foundation.
[03:50:06.165 --> 03:50:06.805]  Right.
[03:50:07.005 --> 03:50:09.768]  And then, I mean, they'll probably put Megyn Kelly as the moderator of all three.
[03:50:10.916 --> 03:50:20.243]  Well, so the point is you have these debates, then you also have this devastating information from Wikileaks, which I expect to continue.
[03:50:20.323 --> 03:50:25.407]  So what I've seen online, the trolls that work for David Brockett,
[03:50:26.243 --> 03:50:28.925]  Correct the record and media matters.
[03:50:28.945 --> 03:50:30.546]  Yeah, they tell you a lot about what they troll with.
[03:50:30.566 --> 03:50:31.306]  What are they worried about?
[03:50:31.546 --> 03:50:34.728]  Oh, they're constantly attacking you and I personally.
[03:50:34.748 --> 03:50:35.749]  It's all name-calling.
[03:50:36.369 --> 03:50:41.112]  And now they're trying to discredit Assange because they know he has the goods.
[03:50:41.192 --> 03:50:42.193]  It's all trolls.
[03:50:42.593 --> 03:50:44.234]  It's all astroturf.
[03:50:44.294 --> 03:50:45.415]  It's all BS.
[03:50:45.695 --> 03:50:55.641]  By the way, both those organizations, Correct the Record and Media Matters for America, are operating illegally in violation of their legal charter under the IRS.
[03:50:56.241 --> 03:50:59.542]  So, it is typical of the Clinton types.
[03:50:59.902 --> 03:51:03.663]  Throw names, call names, personal character assassination.
[03:51:04.143 --> 03:51:10.325]  They can't refute my book, The Clinton's War on Women, which you can get right here at the InfoWars store.
[03:51:10.705 --> 03:51:16.467]  They're not able to refute it on a factual basis, so they engage in name-calling.
[03:51:17.047 --> 03:51:17.747]  Why are they?
[03:51:17.787 --> 03:51:23.469]  Because it's, I mean, I use the word surreal, to see CNN, MSNBC, every night attacking you and I.
[03:51:25.633 --> 03:51:35.883]  And they're not doing it because we're discredited, they're doing it because they're so scared of the fact that it's our talking points that are reality-based, that Trump is talking about wherever he's getting them, and that it's so effective against them.
[03:51:35.903 --> 03:51:37.725]  I mean, why are they so scared of us?
[03:51:37.925 --> 03:51:40.548]  It's bizarre to always be front and center in the middle of this.
[03:51:42.395 --> 03:51:43.835]  You guys are purveyors of truth.
[03:51:44.495 --> 03:51:51.857]  You know, Roger, you laid out a really good argument of the difference between a Trump presidency as opposed to these other guys.
[03:51:52.417 --> 03:51:56.758]  You know, as a marketer, I'm always looking for reducing things to the ridiculous.
[03:51:57.518 --> 03:52:01.658]  I'm tempted to say this is nationalism versus globalism.
[03:52:02.799 --> 03:52:04.399]  This is suicide versus life.
[03:52:05.999 --> 03:52:09.800]  Is that a viable argument or is that ridicule rich?
[03:52:11.016 --> 03:52:18.219]  First of all, I think it's an absolutely accurate and viable argument for some less sophisticated voters.
[03:52:18.379 --> 03:52:29.984]  Perhaps it bears some explanation, but essentially the entire rise of Trump is a rejection of the policies that have brought this country- Trump is America fighting for its life.
[03:52:30.104 --> 03:52:32.325]  Trump is the last gasp, if we don't take it.
[03:52:32.645 --> 03:52:34.526]  Trump is what you were praying for, people.
[03:52:35.762 --> 03:52:37.783]  But Gary, I think, just put his finger on it.
[03:52:37.883 --> 03:52:48.607]  This is the globalists, those who believe in the New World Order, those who believe in regional government, those who no longer believe in American sovereignty, American power, versus the nationalists.
[03:52:48.687 --> 03:52:51.008]  They try to put a negative connotation on that.
[03:52:51.088 --> 03:52:52.109]  Trump loves America.
[03:52:52.529 --> 03:52:54.249]  He believes in the promise of America.
[03:52:54.330 --> 03:52:56.951]  He believes in the exceptionalism of America.
[03:52:56.991 --> 03:53:00.092]  He believes in American sovereignty and American power.
[03:53:00.732 --> 03:53:04.818]  And that's why the New York Times is attacking... They hate the American power part.
[03:53:05.299 --> 03:53:06.180]  They do not like that.
[03:53:06.200 --> 03:53:11.468]  Because they've used our power to parlay into world government, and now they think we're done with this like we're some old hooker.
[03:53:11.768 --> 03:53:12.870]  And no, that's not happening.
[03:53:12.890 --> 03:53:13.611]  It's just not happening.
[03:53:15.370 --> 03:53:21.915]  Well, I'm all for having a simplistic approach because, let's face it, we're fairly sophisticated in this area.
[03:53:21.955 --> 03:53:24.197]  We have time and spent on it.
[03:53:25.057 --> 03:53:31.842]  But to get the attention of the average voter, you know, we can't be bombastic, which is tempting to do because of our frustration.
[03:53:32.163 --> 03:53:32.703]  I am.
[03:53:32.803 --> 03:53:36.626]  But we need... Actually, I was talking about you.
[03:53:37.347 --> 03:53:39.228]  I was about to say Trump bombastic.
[03:53:41.445 --> 03:53:42.126]  Go ahead, sorry.
[03:53:42.406 --> 03:53:53.654]  Well, I'd really like to see some smart marketing here because there are so many things that are obvious now, and thanks to Trump, we have permission to talk about the politically incorrect.
[03:53:54.055 --> 03:53:57.297]  We have permission to talk about globalism and where that leads.
[03:53:57.357 --> 03:54:00.780]  I would have ads where I went, the Chinese president says we can't have Trump.
[03:54:01.040 --> 03:54:03.622]  The Saudi president says we can't have Trump or the Saudi leader.
[03:54:03.922 --> 03:54:05.063]  This leader says that one leader.
[03:54:05.443 --> 03:54:06.204]  What about you?
[03:54:06.224 --> 03:54:07.285]  I mean, I would just say like,
[03:54:07.665 --> 03:54:09.325]  But, you know, what do the voters say?
[03:54:09.365 --> 03:54:11.686]  Well, the Communist Party fully supports Hillary.
[03:54:11.886 --> 03:54:12.206]  Exactly.
[03:54:12.406 --> 03:54:15.686]  Communist Party, you, I mean, every demon group on earth is against Trump.
[03:54:16.847 --> 03:54:17.927]  This is a no-brainer for me.
[03:54:18.347 --> 03:54:18.647]  Roger?
[03:54:19.567 --> 03:54:20.847]  That's about right.
[03:54:21.368 --> 03:54:27.129]  You know, I do think that this is going to continue because the mainstream media is not going to let up.
[03:54:27.189 --> 03:54:33.770]  They want this race to be over right now, probably because they know that Hillary doesn't have the stamina for the close.
[03:54:33.950 --> 03:54:34.590]  That's my next question.
[03:54:34.930 --> 03:54:35.911]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[03:54:36.132 --> 03:54:39.376]  She's crawling, she's falling apart, she's degenerating.
[03:54:39.396 --> 03:54:41.218]  They're even starting to admit it in mainstream media.
[03:54:41.919 --> 03:54:43.241]  What are they planning then?
[03:54:43.301 --> 03:54:44.543]  I mean, are they going to replace her?
[03:54:44.943 --> 03:54:47.506]  Have a fake assassination attempt to make her a hero?
[03:54:48.895 --> 03:54:51.957]  They'll never replace her because the they is she.
[03:54:52.318 --> 03:54:55.160]  The Clintons are now in control of the Democratic Party.
[03:54:55.640 --> 03:55:02.405]  Many of my friends in the Democratic Party are supporting her, not because they want to, but because they're afraid not to.
[03:55:02.805 --> 03:55:06.448]  The Clintons are famously vindictive and they keep score.
[03:55:07.309 --> 03:55:12.793]  Additionally, however, you have Trump out last week doing four campaign events in one day.
[03:55:13.393 --> 03:55:21.219]  This guy is almost 70, but he is showing a Herculean personal stamina, working like a dog to win this election.
[03:55:21.740 --> 03:55:23.421]  She can barely stand up.
[03:55:24.282 --> 03:55:28.465]  She has continued to eschew any questions about anything.
[03:55:28.545 --> 03:55:30.567]  Her health, the Clinton Foundation.
[03:55:31.687 --> 03:55:44.933]  And so, ISIS, last week, as you know, Trump landed a clean punch because Obama and Hillary, as well as the Bush administration, are responsible for the rise of ISIS.
[03:55:44.993 --> 03:55:45.253]  Yes.
[03:55:45.794 --> 03:55:50.656]  And the mainstream media attempted to ridicule Trump as if that is untrue.
[03:55:50.736 --> 03:55:52.496]  However, it is true.
[03:55:52.957 --> 03:55:58.199]  At a minimum, one would have to deny, indisputably, Hillary armed ISIS.
[03:55:58.679 --> 03:56:00.420]  And that is a stone cold fact.
[03:56:00.620 --> 03:56:03.801]  And she created the vacuum and put him in charge and did everything else for him.
[03:56:04.561 --> 03:56:14.064]  So, from the internal pulls of the research, what, I mean, is it, I mean, for me, I think there's this clause to a degree about others that, you know, won't say they're voting for Trump.
[03:56:14.184 --> 03:56:15.104]  I think Trump's way ahead.
[03:56:15.124 --> 03:56:20.246]  I mean, I know we can't be overconfident here, but I think this illusion that Hillary's really ahead has to be defeated.
[03:56:21.728 --> 03:56:24.611]  I actually don't think that Trump is necessarily ahead.
[03:56:24.651 --> 03:56:27.573]  He may be down three or four points.
[03:56:27.994 --> 03:56:32.317]  Remember, polling is only good in the episecond in which it is taken.
[03:56:32.758 --> 03:56:38.703]  The instant it's compiled, it is technically already obsolete because things are moving around.
[03:56:38.803 --> 03:56:40.124]  Voters are moving around.
[03:56:40.204 --> 03:56:40.945]  They are affected.
[03:56:41.545 --> 03:56:45.329]  By the daily coverage of the race, both good and bad.
[03:56:45.750 --> 03:56:47.972]  So the numbers are always going to fluctuate.
[03:56:48.533 --> 03:56:51.336]  Is Hillary pulled out to some insurmountable lead?
[03:56:51.976 --> 03:56:52.957]  Absolutely not.
[03:56:53.358 --> 03:56:57.522]  Is Trump still even or leading in more than half of the swing states?
[03:56:58.063 --> 03:56:58.804]  Yes, he is.
[03:56:59.284 --> 03:57:07.052]  Is there any place in which he's now out of range other than reliably blue states where he never was going to win any place?
[03:57:07.092 --> 03:57:08.513]  The answer is no.
[03:57:08.974 --> 03:57:21.546]  So despite the fact that the mainstream media attempts to put this race away, to call it for Hillary in August is just not... Gary, I have a final question and then Roger Stone, any other points you need to make?
[03:57:21.727 --> 03:57:22.607]  We have two minutes left.
[03:57:23.268 --> 03:57:28.312]  Yeah, you know, what's funny, we forgot about what he spoke about ISIS last week.
[03:57:28.352 --> 03:57:29.253]  That's huge!
[03:57:29.893 --> 03:57:30.574]  Huge courage!
[03:57:30.634 --> 03:57:32.135]  I'm just so proud I support Trump.
[03:57:33.296 --> 03:57:44.564]  You know, I'm friends with Rand Paul, and during the debate, he was being accused of being an isolationist, and he uttered the words, well, the first thing I would do is stop supporting ISIS.
[03:57:45.065 --> 03:57:45.845]  And then he shut up.
[03:57:46.446 --> 03:57:49.929]  And I told him later, I said, why didn't you go down that trail?
[03:57:51.430 --> 03:58:00.236]  You know, what turned me on to ISIS being a CIA creation was when the weapons in Mosul were completely turned over.
[03:58:00.276 --> 03:58:05.419]  The vehicles, there were 2,500 armored Humvees with the keys left in the ignition.
[03:58:05.960 --> 03:58:10.923]  And you know, we had an aircraft carrier right out there in the Persian Gulf, could have sent two F-18s and destroyed it.
[03:58:11.003 --> 03:58:12.424]  Absolutely, so that facts out.
[03:58:12.484 --> 03:58:14.486]  Roger Stone, 60 seconds, closing comments on that.
[03:58:14.986 --> 03:58:22.253]  You know what's strictly disturbing to me was the way Katie Turrer of NBC goes up on her Twitter feed and says Trump is wrong about ISIS.
[03:58:22.734 --> 03:58:25.917]  No, Katie, Trump is absolutely right about ISIS.
[03:58:27.739 --> 03:58:28.439]  Oh, well, that's right.
[03:58:28.480 --> 03:58:31.302]  I think they went too far, because that's a known fact.
[03:58:31.643 --> 03:58:34.285]  And that really shows the mainstream media is losing its power.
[03:58:34.686 --> 03:58:36.868]  Roger Stone, StoneZone.com, thank you so much.
[03:58:36.888 --> 03:58:37.689]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[03:58:38.410 --> 03:58:39.011]  Great to be here.
[03:58:39.051 --> 03:58:39.611]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:58:39.651 --> 03:58:39.851]  You bet.
[03:58:39.871 --> 03:58:41.253]  Let's talk on the phone this afternoon if you can.
[03:58:41.293 --> 03:58:44.435]  Gary Haven, the film, American, available exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:58:44.456 --> 03:58:46.117]  Thank you for everything you've done, my friend.
[03:58:46.738 --> 03:58:48.399]  And I want to thank the audience and the great crew.
[03:58:48.459 --> 03:58:50.121]  Nightly News Tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[03:58:50.141 --> 03:58:54.064]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:55.205 --> 03:58:56.747]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:59:00.880 --> 03:59:10.210]  Hillary Clinton apparently suffers from Parkinson's, or a similar disease, and experiences seizures from flashing lights, such as camera flashes at press conferences, the Secret Service told InfoWars.
