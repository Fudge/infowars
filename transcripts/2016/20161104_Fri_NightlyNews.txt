[00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:22.086]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:25.968]  It is Friday, November 4th, 2016 and I'm Leigh-Anne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:26.949]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:39.412]  Just when you thought the election couldn't get any crazier, WikiLeaks drops the biggest bombshell yet, Spirit Cookie!
[00:00:39.612 --> 00:00:44.357]  The Clinton campaign chairman involved in a bizarre occultic ritual.
[00:00:44.537 --> 00:00:53.905]  Meanwhile, a new lawsuit reveals how Bill Clinton took multiple trips aboard the Lolita Express to Pedophile Island.
[00:00:54.045 --> 00:00:56.267]  And it looks like Hillary Clinton went there too.
[00:00:57.248 --> 00:01:02.270]  Then, the NYPD is ready to make arrests in the Anthony Weiner case.
[00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.011]  But first, they'll have to get past the DOJ.
[00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:10.412]  All that plus a look at what to expect on Election Day.
[00:01:10.632 --> 00:01:13.553]  Our last chance to save the Republic.
[00:01:13.813 --> 00:01:20.795]  If we just sigh and shake our heads and accept this, then what does that tell our kids about who we are?
[00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:23.816]  That's coming up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:36.090]  I want to see 10 million viewers tune in over the 50-plus hours, and that's where you come in.
[00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.271]  You are the heart and blood of the InfoWar.
[00:01:38.592 --> 00:01:49.860]  If you spread the link to InfoWars.com forward slash show and point out that this is the alternative new media, this is the rebellion, then all of you are riding right beside us, not behind us.
[00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:55.805]  So spread the word by Paul Reveres, no matter where you live in the world, to Information Warfare Arms.
[00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:59.188]  The globalists are coming, and they will be met on the field.
[00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:10.452]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:12.795]  It's a fight for our minds.
[00:02:13.455 --> 00:02:15.378]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:19.924]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:02:20.044 --> 00:02:23.408]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.091]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:25.832]  Take action!
[00:03:01.567 --> 00:03:07.829]  Well, without a doubt, we woke up to the most bizarre WikiLeaks revelation to date.
[00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:12.370]  The Clinton campaign chairman, John Podesta, was invited to a spirit cooking dinner.
[00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:21.432]  Now, spirit cooking dinner, this is a cult black magic practice founded by Alistair Crowley, you know, famous Satanist Alistair Crowley.
[00:03:22.052 --> 00:03:24.573]  And this woman, she's an artist.
[00:03:24.613 --> 00:03:26.133]  She's a performance artist.
[00:03:26.813 --> 00:03:27.314]  We're good to go.
[00:03:43.894 --> 00:03:56.145]  There's videos of this woman, totally bizarro, sitting here pulling her shirt up, getting a razor blade and carving a pentagram into her stomach with the blood dripping on TED Talk, calling this art.
[00:03:56.185 --> 00:03:56.926]  That's not art.
[00:03:57.406 --> 00:03:58.107]  You don't get it.
[00:03:58.227 --> 00:03:58.667]  It's art.
[00:03:59.508 --> 00:04:01.710]  Well, the issue here is we've always known this is going on.
[00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.893]  This is what our intel keeps bringing us about who these people are.
[00:04:05.494 --> 00:04:08.977]  And this is this is groups now connected in.
[00:04:10.322 --> 00:04:10.382]  to
[00:04:40.482 --> 00:04:41.802]  And Hillary Clinton six times.
[00:04:42.283 --> 00:04:42.603]  Yeah.
[00:04:42.623 --> 00:04:45.704]  And look, Bill Clinton wrote a book admitting he's into voodoo.
[00:04:46.464 --> 00:04:47.644]  And I'm not getting Drudge wrong.
[00:04:47.664 --> 00:04:49.185]  I mean, it's a good headline, but Wiki Wiccan.
[00:04:49.605 --> 00:04:52.906]  Wiki is just kind of the modern popular term for this or anybody that isn't a Christian.
[00:04:53.286 --> 00:04:55.686]  No, most people that are into Wicca are not into this stuff.
[00:04:56.067 --> 00:05:01.868]  This is classic black magic, Aleister Crowley level stuff, Podesta practices occult magic.
[00:05:02.248 --> 00:05:03.669]  Drudge has that part right.
[00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:04.269]  This is crazy.
[00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:05.130]  It's very bizarre.
[00:05:19.326 --> 00:05:30.336]  A handwritten letter he sends out basically saying that he, you know, he failed in his job as Guccifer and the one thing he really wanted to do was to fully expose the Illuminati, the Council, and their crimes.
[00:05:30.716 --> 00:05:37.883]  And he says, Hillary Rodham Diane Clinton is one of the high priests, a goddess of this occult, satanic shadow group.
[00:05:38.575 --> 00:05:39.796]  They're called Mothers of Darkness.
[00:05:39.996 --> 00:05:42.357]  And at the time, people were like, okay, he's gone crazy.
[00:05:42.377 --> 00:05:45.358]  Well, there's the headline, Hillary Clinton is a high priestess of Satanism.
[00:05:45.618 --> 00:05:45.839]  Yes.
[00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:47.039]  And there's your headline.
[00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:51.801]  And then you were discovering with listeners, and I looked it up, it's there, it's the island he owns.
[00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:52.582]  Let's talk about that.
[00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:53.982]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:05:54.043 --> 00:05:54.243]  Yes.
[00:05:55.203 --> 00:05:56.864]  It is Orgy Island.
[00:05:57.245 --> 00:05:58.125]  It's called St.
[00:05:58.225 --> 00:05:58.746]  James.
[00:05:58.986 --> 00:05:59.386]  Little St.
[00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:00.247]  James Island.
[00:06:00.808 --> 00:06:04.190]  And people like Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, Prince Andrew.
[00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.992]  It's pretty much like Eyes Wide Shut.
[00:06:07.573 --> 00:06:09.514]  Tom Cruise happening right there.
[00:06:09.534 --> 00:06:09.975]  Look at that.
[00:06:10.355 --> 00:06:11.035]  Look at this building.
[00:06:11.076 --> 00:06:13.157]  It looks like some kind of Egyptian... And this is the island he owns.
[00:06:13.197 --> 00:06:15.139]  Yeah, this is like an Egyptian...
[00:06:18.101 --> 00:06:21.903]  Yes, and it's got this owl statue on top.
[00:06:22.624 --> 00:06:32.010]  There are other pictures where you can sort of see from up above, it appears as if it has an underground passageway, and this is on the other side of the island.
[00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:40.296]  Most of the pictures that they'll show you from Jeffrey Epstein's Orgy Island where he held sex slaves, it's way across the other end of the island.
[00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:41.197]  And he's been convicted.
[00:06:41.217 --> 00:06:42.437]  I mean, this has come out in the court.
[00:06:42.477 --> 00:06:43.438]  Yeah, but this is legit.
[00:06:43.458 --> 00:07:02.190]  So back in 2005, police conducted an 11-month-long undercover investigation on Jeffrey Epstein and his estate after the mother of a 14-year-old girl went to police after suspecting her daughter was paid $300 for at least one sexual act on the island in which she was ordered to strip, leaving on just her panties while giving Epstein a massage.
[00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:03.170]  Right.
[00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.311]  But that's just one case that's been brought forward.
[00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:10.692]  You've got Bill Clinton going there 20 times, Hillary Clinton 6 times.
[00:07:10.732 --> 00:07:12.773]  We see how Hillary Clinton looks at women.
[00:07:12.813 --> 00:07:14.453]  Wonder how she looks at the even younger women.
[00:07:14.933 --> 00:07:15.113]  Right.
[00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:17.974]  It's completely and totally out of this world.
[00:07:18.034 --> 00:07:19.134]  I don't have a child yet.
[00:07:19.194 --> 00:07:25.456]  Clinton also flies on his plane to the Sheik's Castle in the Middle East, who is an admitted pedophile.
[00:07:26.016 --> 00:07:27.078]  So this is going on.
[00:07:27.098 --> 00:07:28.741]  They've got a weird temple out there.
[00:07:29.322 --> 00:07:32.988]  You've got them involved in all these other satanic rituals and what WikiLeaks keeps saying is...
[00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:36.572]  If you don't back down, Hillary, we're going to release even more.
[00:07:36.592 --> 00:07:37.513]  So that's the big story.
[00:07:37.733 --> 00:07:38.473]  What's coming next?
[00:07:38.613 --> 00:07:38.773]  Right.
[00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:44.997]  And well, I also, you know, it's I think it's key, of course, that we had Steve Buchenek on the show for the first time in 25 years.
[00:07:45.037 --> 00:07:50.559]  He actually comes out on video saying, look, there's an internal coup against Hillary Clinton going on.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.562]  And we were the ones that handed over these documents to WikiLeaks because we want to expose what's going on.
[00:07:56.622 --> 00:08:03.466]  And frankly, I believe this is why it was Podesta's emails that got leaked, not, say, Robbie Mook or Cheryl Mills.
[00:08:03.926 --> 00:08:04.387]  Let's explain.
[00:08:04.407 --> 00:08:06.630]  Why are they historically involved in Satanism and illegal stuff?
[00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.432]  Because just like a local gang will have you go
[00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:26.152]  You know, shoot a bank teller or shoot some lady at the liquor store, it's so they have dirt on you.
[00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:27.312]  You've proven you're bad.
[00:08:27.332 --> 00:08:33.576]  And so that's why pedophilia and Satanism keeps coming up, because this is how they compromise you when you enter the cult.
[00:08:33.876 --> 00:08:34.296]  Exactly.
[00:08:34.336 --> 00:08:45.043]  Well, Rob Dew actually pointed out how Lady Gaga, before she had her meteoric rise to fame, she was the backup dancer for this other young teenage success.
[00:08:45.743 --> 00:08:56.367]  And mysteriously this girl was dancing happy and then an hour later she flung herself from the rooftop and then immediately after that Lady Gaga, her backup dancer, launches into the thing.
[00:08:56.387 --> 00:08:58.167]  Who is best buddies with this high priestess?
[00:08:58.187 --> 00:09:06.710]  Who loves this high priestess who we have a photograph of her where she's scooping blood-like coagulated syrup off of a naked...
[00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:13.235]  Yeah, I watched a video where the two of them were doing this weird yoga stuff.
[00:09:13.295 --> 00:09:19.661]  Stripping their clothes off in rivers, posing with giant crystals, sprinkling crystals all over their bodies.
[00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:25.385]  And by the way, you're lucky we're not showing you the footage of effigies of babies dumping blood on top of them.
[00:09:26.326 --> 00:09:27.367]  I don't want to show too much.
[00:09:27.527 --> 00:09:28.668]  Let's show some of it on screen.
[00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:31.691]  This is the least graphic stuff.
[00:09:32.091 --> 00:09:35.373]  Yeah, I mean, you can basically just Google spirit cooking.
[00:09:35.614 --> 00:09:46.741]  And so this woman, Marina Abramovic, I'm not saying her name right, but she also wrote this cookbook with all of these occult recipes so that you can practice these sex cult rituals.
[00:09:46.862 --> 00:09:51.965]  She explains how if they're done inside of an art studio, then it's art.
[00:09:52.005 --> 00:10:01.011]  If it's an art gallery like the B-roll we have showing you where they're throwing this blood everywhere, you know, you have to stab yourself in the hand and eat the pain and stuff.
[00:10:01.992 --> 00:10:05.054]  She goes on to say that if it's in an art gallery, it's art.
[00:10:05.094 --> 00:10:11.679]  But if it's at a private dinner party, like what Podestas have been invited to, that it's an actual ritual taking place.
[00:10:11.699 --> 00:10:13.801]  Look at this woman with her stupid goat head.
[00:10:13.821 --> 00:10:14.261]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:17.904]  Well, the thing that's really crazy as well, I mean, this woman is almost 70 years old.
[00:10:18.404 --> 00:10:19.105]  They're worshiping her.
[00:10:19.145 --> 00:10:26.791]  She looks damn good for her age, which just is, to me, we're always joking about Hillary Clinton going to get baby's blood transfusions.
[00:10:26.991 --> 00:10:29.974]  Well, the Queen of England and her mother do get those children's blood transfusions.
[00:10:29.994 --> 00:10:32.075]  They found all these dead bodies on their property.
[00:10:32.376 --> 00:10:33.096]  Jimmy Savelle.
[00:10:33.116 --> 00:10:35.318]  I mean, this is what's going on at the heart of it.
[00:10:35.538 --> 00:10:39.021]  It makes you wonder what's going on with all those Planned Parenthood baby parts.
[00:10:39.041 --> 00:10:40.582]  You know, what were they doing with those?
[00:10:40.602 --> 00:10:41.383]  Who was buying those?
[00:10:41.723 --> 00:10:44.726]  Well, they admit they even keep babies alive sometimes before they harvest them.
[00:10:45.319 --> 00:10:54.043]  Well, the thing that's really interesting, I know, I believe that you did a video earlier, Biggs, about the three young children that were promised entertainment.
[00:10:54.083 --> 00:10:58.945]  They'd be there in the hot tub, and it was this woman emailing, and it was her children.
[00:10:59.105 --> 00:11:06.889]  Yes, offering her children up to Podesta, and his other male companions, says these three children will be ubered in.
[00:11:07.669 --> 00:11:08.490]  There will be a pool.
[00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:09.110]  We're heating it.
[00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:11.052]  They are there for your entertainment.
[00:11:11.112 --> 00:11:11.252]  Right.
[00:11:11.433 --> 00:11:12.734]  Talk about where this is from.
[00:11:13.054 --> 00:11:15.096]  As more of this comes out, we have little kids for you.
[00:11:15.116 --> 00:11:15.396]  Tell them.
[00:11:15.817 --> 00:11:16.017]  Yeah.
[00:11:16.277 --> 00:11:17.558]  So they're inviting these kids.
[00:11:17.578 --> 00:11:19.140]  They're letting pedestrians know.
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.000]  This is on WikiLeaks.
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:20.961]  You can find it on WikiLeaks.
[00:11:20.981 --> 00:11:21.682]  You can go to my Twitter.
[00:11:21.742 --> 00:11:22.563]  I tweeted out the link.
[00:11:22.643 --> 00:11:22.983]  All that.
[00:11:23.303 --> 00:11:24.204]  It is easy to find.
[00:11:25.605 --> 00:11:30.550]  Meanwhile, they make a man saying to a woman, I think you're beautiful, rape.
[00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:31.070]  Right.
[00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.971]  That's terrible.
[00:11:33.052 --> 00:11:34.873]  But we can do blood occult rituals.
[00:11:34.913 --> 00:11:37.995]  We can say, we got little kids in a hot tub for you.
[00:11:38.015 --> 00:11:43.438]  Trump says mean things, but it's okay for Hillary Clinton, John Podesta on the swim in a hot tub with an 11 year old.
[00:11:43.658 --> 00:11:45.839]  It was an 11 year old, a 9 year old, and a 7 year old child.
[00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:47.680]  And it's not like he's over and your kid's in the pool.
[00:11:48.683 --> 00:11:50.445]  They're saying, we have little kids for you.
[00:11:50.705 --> 00:11:55.529]  No, yeah, it's like, it's like a, the letter is all like, oh, you know, we're going to have our thing, talk about business.
[00:11:55.929 --> 00:11:58.691]  Uh, by the way, we're going to heat up the hot tub this year.
[00:11:58.771 --> 00:12:02.995]  And by the way, this spirit cooking though is the hot, it's the number one trend on the web.
[00:12:03.155 --> 00:12:04.816]  At least two hours ago, it was number one.
[00:12:04.897 --> 00:12:06.658]  It's been hot trend all day.
[00:12:06.678 --> 00:12:08.760]  I mean, and what are they going to do now?
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.202]  The thing that's so, I mean, they're like weirdo creeps with,
[00:12:11.562 --> 00:12:12.822]  Are the children in the hot tub?
[00:12:12.842 --> 00:12:14.183]  It's like, I'm liberal.
[00:12:14.243 --> 00:12:15.743]  Are the children in the hot tub?
[00:12:15.863 --> 00:12:17.584]  If you go up on the Twitter right there.
[00:12:17.624 --> 00:12:19.205]  Will there be children there in the hot tub?
[00:12:19.265 --> 00:12:21.605]  It's like, normal guys are like, are there hot chicks in the hot tub?
[00:12:21.846 --> 00:12:22.806]  It's like, what the hell?
[00:12:23.106 --> 00:12:24.286]  That's bad though.
[00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:25.607]  That's sexual.
[00:12:25.627 --> 00:12:27.167]  So let's open up the email.
[00:12:27.207 --> 00:12:29.128]  Brittany Pettybone right here.
[00:12:29.508 --> 00:12:30.348]  The WikiLeaks email.
[00:12:30.368 --> 00:12:30.869]  Pull that up.
[00:12:30.969 --> 00:12:31.829]  That's the one right there.
[00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:40.932]  And it talks about, with enormous gratitude, it talks about how there's an 11 year old, a 9 year old, and a 7 year old who are going to be in the pool.
[00:12:41.192 --> 00:12:43.893]  So you'll have them for further entertainment.
[00:13:00.811 --> 00:13:01.051]  This is
[00:13:16.571 --> 00:13:19.034]  I'm not making up all this craziness that ends up being true.
[00:13:19.054 --> 00:13:19.935]  Well, it's like a puzzle.
[00:13:19.995 --> 00:13:21.376]  It's like they're doing it.
[00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:23.198]  I didn't come up with any of this.
[00:13:23.258 --> 00:13:26.541]  I'd love to have the freaking credit.
[00:13:26.601 --> 00:13:27.322]  I didn't, Joe.
[00:13:27.382 --> 00:13:29.724]  Well, it's like when someone hands you a box with no picture on it.
[00:13:29.744 --> 00:13:30.205]  It's a puzzle.
[00:13:30.525 --> 00:13:31.946]  You start putting enough pieces together.
[00:13:32.167 --> 00:13:36.291]  You might not have the whole picture, but you can sit back and look and see what's going to happen next.
[00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:40.195]  You can make that picture out in your head and figure out what's going to happen and what you're going to see.
[00:13:40.655 --> 00:13:41.536]  And that's all it is.
[00:13:41.616 --> 00:13:50.542]  Here we do investigative journalism, we sit back, we look at information, we piece it together for people to understand, and then eventually at some point in time it starts to click.
[00:13:50.562 --> 00:13:55.045]  You're like, wait, this is what the whole picture is going to turn out to be.
[00:13:55.385 --> 00:14:00.989]  And that's why people are still trying to comb through these emails looking for the code, the code words, code language.
[00:14:01.409 --> 00:14:18.674]  Oh yeah, the feds are saying, notice we had guests on last week, this week before it came out about the NYPD and all this coming out, now it's coming out, and they said, look it's kids, it's Satanism, and even I know all this, I'm even going, maybe we shouldn't say Satanism on air, that sounds crazy, because I did that two days ago.
[00:14:18.694 --> 00:14:23.935]  Well last time when I was reading it, I was kind of scared, I was like, if I post a video about this right now, people are going to think I'm nuts.
[00:14:24.035 --> 00:14:26.136]  Right, I was a little, I was apprehensive.
[00:14:26.296 --> 00:14:29.837]  No, no, I know all this stuff and I'm telling people, go slow, no, no.
[00:14:30.993 --> 00:14:37.798]  It's just like they just opened the floodgates and that's what Pecheneg was saying the night before he came on the show and spoke with you in his videos.
[00:14:37.838 --> 00:14:40.040]  He was just like, here it is, we're laying it all out.
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:44.764]  For the first time they've given me permission to speak out and that's what I'm doing on camera.
[00:14:44.784 --> 00:14:45.865]  By the way, he's on Sunday.
[00:14:45.925 --> 00:14:46.725]  I talked to him today.
[00:14:46.765 --> 00:14:47.886]  He wasn't on the day but something happened.
[00:14:48.126 --> 00:14:53.130]  He's on Sunday in the second hour and he said you're dead on with Hillary and that's why they're all so upset with her.
[00:14:54.011 --> 00:14:54.431]  I don't know.
[00:15:12.717 --> 00:15:22.063]  Human parts like livers and stuff and she's sitting there chunking it out against the wall and there's this weird black and white footage of this woman right here where she has snakes crawling all over her head.
[00:15:22.103 --> 00:15:25.145]  She strips her clothes off, lays on a table and starts screaming.
[00:15:26.566 --> 00:15:28.688]  And it goes on for 30 minutes.
[00:15:29.048 --> 00:15:29.348]  Wow.
[00:15:29.728 --> 00:15:35.112]  And the thing that's really key that people need to understand is that this has been the top trending thing all day.
[00:15:35.552 --> 00:15:36.373]  Number one story.
[00:15:36.393 --> 00:15:36.773]  I knew.
[00:15:36.793 --> 00:15:37.994]  I told her about it.
[00:15:38.034 --> 00:15:38.574]  I woke up at 4 a.m.
[00:15:38.594 --> 00:15:39.255]  before this even broke.
[00:15:39.275 --> 00:15:40.075]  I said, something's going on.
[00:15:40.115 --> 00:15:40.636]  I feel the energy.
[00:15:42.757 --> 00:15:43.417]  And now it's here.
[00:15:43.497 --> 00:15:47.740]  This is going to bring them down because remember I told people how the Secret Service and FBI think they're satanic.
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:53.643]  It's in the London Guardian that quote the FBI think she's the Antichrist literally and the agents are all freaked out don't want to be around her.
[00:15:54.003 --> 00:15:55.504]  It's because I've talked to them.
[00:15:55.544 --> 00:15:56.064]  You have too.
[00:15:56.084 --> 00:15:57.025]  They're like listen
[00:15:57.825 --> 00:16:01.507]  They wouldn't even tell us, they go, just, uh, they're very dangerous and, uh, we're like, what is this?
[00:16:01.587 --> 00:16:02.348]  It's worse than you know, please.
[00:16:02.688 --> 00:16:04.409]  Like, uh, we can't, I don't know, what happens?
[00:16:04.429 --> 00:16:05.089]  They go, Linda Blair!
[00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.529]  Linda Blair!
[00:16:05.549 --> 00:16:06.370]  And we're like, what?
[00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:07.671]  Just, just, warn everyone!
[00:16:07.871 --> 00:16:10.272]  We, we, I mean, they're like, we're like, what's going on?
[00:16:10.292 --> 00:16:13.714]  They're like, uh, it's bad, uh, I mean, what the hell, dude?
[00:16:13.734 --> 00:16:15.235]  They won't even tell us, man.
[00:16:15.755 --> 00:16:18.397]  The grown men start shaking.
[00:16:18.457 --> 00:16:19.978]  Well, they probably feel like they can see you.
[00:16:19.998 --> 00:16:20.598]  And they're telling us this.
[00:16:20.618 --> 00:16:22.019]  Yeah, but we were there with the Secret Service.
[00:16:22.039 --> 00:16:24.040]  But this is, this is the odd, this is the odd thing.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.721]  How freaked out was the Secret Service in July?
[00:16:26.141 --> 00:16:28.062]  I would say jittery, shaking.
[00:16:30.242 --> 00:16:34.184]  But you know this, these people are so satanic, they are so evil.
[00:16:34.764 --> 00:16:38.365]  There's no end to their corruption, what they're willing to do.
[00:16:38.825 --> 00:16:39.765]  I mean, look at this.
[00:16:40.085 --> 00:16:41.266]  Comey had every reason
[00:16:42.226 --> 00:16:44.307]  They were threatening all their families.
[00:16:44.327 --> 00:16:45.147]  Yes, of course.
[00:16:45.247 --> 00:16:50.069]  At the end of the day, who's to say that they wouldn't do that as well if their family, their children, all that.
[00:16:50.089 --> 00:16:51.609]  But they should know the threat didn't work.
[00:16:51.649 --> 00:16:54.210]  People went okay and then went super normal.
[00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.592]  Thank God the NYPD seized Wiener's laptop, made copies of it.
[00:16:58.612 --> 00:17:08.275]  I was about to say, was your idea in closing, they gave it to the feds, the feds did nothing, they pressured them, they were getting ready for a press conference as we reported first two days ago, now confirmed by Breitbart Today and Eric Prentz of Blackwater.
[00:17:08.775 --> 00:17:09.856]  All this is coming out.
[00:17:10.516 --> 00:17:11.677]  Dude, the mercenaries aren't angels.
[00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:12.658]  They're even pissing ready to go.
[00:17:12.978 --> 00:17:14.299]  What does that say when Prince goes public?
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.320]  The global's better watch.
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.621]  He's an ex-Navy SEAL.
[00:17:16.782 --> 00:17:18.683]  That means they've got groups on standby right now.
[00:17:18.703 --> 00:17:19.544]  They're trying to take this country.
[00:17:19.644 --> 00:17:21.265]  Well, they don't want- What does that signify?
[00:17:21.306 --> 00:17:21.946]  This is the thing, though.
[00:17:21.966 --> 00:17:24.628]  The NYPD, you should have nothing to fear.
[00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:28.932]  You release this information, screw what the FBI's doing, screw what James Comey's doing.
[00:17:29.192 --> 00:17:30.594]  Release that information.
[00:17:30.674 --> 00:17:31.694]  I guarantee you.
[00:17:32.355 --> 00:17:35.496]  You've seen what Donald Trump did for that homeless lady who guarded his star.
[00:17:35.816 --> 00:17:39.857]  Think about what it would take for the NYPD to go ahead and release that information.
[00:17:39.897 --> 00:17:41.097]  You're saving America.
[00:17:41.397 --> 00:17:42.858]  Trump will pardon all of you.
[00:17:42.878 --> 00:17:44.878]  You don't have any future if they win.
[00:17:45.138 --> 00:17:47.239]  You gotta be all in, and you are all in.
[00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:52.200]  And all NYPD right now, if you have this information and you're in control of it, release it.
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.461]  Give it to WikiLeaks, give it to us, give it to somebody.
[00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:55.561]  Let's get it out there.
[00:17:55.921 --> 00:17:57.261]  Tuesday's around the corner.
[00:17:57.541 --> 00:17:59.662]  The fate of America is depending right now.
[00:18:00.462 --> 00:18:00.802]  On this.
[00:18:01.062 --> 00:18:02.403]  This isn't just a fight for America.
[00:18:02.423 --> 00:18:04.103]  This is a fight against good and evil.
[00:18:04.563 --> 00:18:06.184]  This is a spiritual war now.
[00:18:06.444 --> 00:18:07.044]  It's all down the line.
[00:18:07.064 --> 00:18:09.684]  Haven't you seen how evil and occult this whole thing is?
[00:18:09.764 --> 00:18:12.205]  I mean, like I said, I was reading this stuff late last night.
[00:18:12.285 --> 00:18:13.325]  I couldn't sleep last night.
[00:18:13.545 --> 00:18:15.746]  I haven't had nightmares since I got back from combat.
[00:18:16.026 --> 00:18:17.466]  And this stuff, I had goosebumps.
[00:18:17.526 --> 00:18:19.267]  I woke up in the middle of the night, I heard a creaking hallway.
[00:18:19.287 --> 00:18:20.907]  Can you imagine being a little kid and Hillary comes in the room?
[00:18:21.147 --> 00:18:27.089]  Hey, that's why I always said, when she's around little kids on the stage, I literally just, the willies, Leanne, I know you're taking a break, what's coming up next?
[00:18:27.574 --> 00:18:32.776]  Well, and also too, I want people to understand how incredible it is that the mainstream media is not talking about this story.
[00:18:32.936 --> 00:18:34.696]  That's the big news!
[00:18:34.736 --> 00:18:41.518]  They would give any chance they could to throw us under the bus and make fun of us, but they are not talking about this story because that's how huge it is.
[00:18:41.598 --> 00:18:45.300]  It hit a nerve when I said there were statements a month ago.
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.280]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:52.242]  Well, coming up we're also going to talk, David Knight's got a great report coming up exposing how they're trying to steal the election.
[00:18:52.482 --> 00:18:53.302]  Stick around, that's coming right up.
[00:18:53.302 --> 00:18:58.724]  And that's why they freaked out, because when I said, oh, it's coming out, you're Satanist, they tried to counter it then before the info came out.
[00:19:01.605 --> 00:19:19.292]  My fellow Americans, my fellow humans on planet Earth, there is an epic, legendary awakening of nationalism and populism happening from the Brexit to the Donald Trump phenomenon to Russia pulling out of the New World Order and arresting the bankster oligarchs.
[00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:22.414]  Humanity's will for self-determination
[00:19:23.334 --> 00:19:25.135]  And freedom is expressing itself.
[00:19:25.636 --> 00:19:33.021]  The great classical liberalisms of Thomas Jefferson and Francis Bacon are reawakening right now.
[00:19:33.822 --> 00:19:43.009]  And it's because of the historical times we live in that InfoWars is going to embark on an unprecedented 52-hour broadcast.
[00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:47.672]  We've done 24-hour broadcasts before, but we've never gone 52 hours.
[00:19:49.113 --> 00:19:51.816]  This Monday, from 11 a.m.
[00:19:51.876 --> 00:19:57.563]  Central, right through Tuesday, right into Wednesday, when the Wednesday show ends at 3 p.m.
[00:19:57.603 --> 00:20:03.690]  Central, we will broadcast for an unprecedented, legendary, over-the-top 52 hours live.
[00:20:06.013 --> 00:20:08.374]  The second great awakening is taking place.
[00:20:09.155 --> 00:20:16.598]  We are in the dawn of a new era of renaissance, of rediscovery and human liberty.
[00:20:17.238 --> 00:20:30.305]  Donald Trump, the Brexit, Infowars, Matt Drudge, Breitbart, WorldNetDaily and so many others are only one small manifestation in the fire of liberty that is now exploding across the globe.
[00:20:30.925 --> 00:20:32.506]  You can see it in the news.
[00:20:32.566 --> 00:20:33.466]  You can feel it.
[00:20:33.946 --> 00:20:35.167]  You can witness it on the street.
[00:20:35.827 --> 00:20:36.687]  History's happening.
[00:20:37.028 --> 00:20:41.169]  They always say this election is the most important in our lifetimes and we laugh it off.
[00:20:41.289 --> 00:20:44.751]  I wouldn't even get involved in past elections because they were so clearly frauds.
[00:20:45.431 --> 00:20:46.612]  This one's the big kahuna.
[00:20:47.452 --> 00:20:55.836]  A clear demarcation line, a crossroads between nationalism and tyranny, between Americanism and globalism.
[00:20:56.477 --> 00:21:00.619]  That's why we're doing this one time and one time only, because history's happening.
[00:21:01.079 --> 00:21:09.203]  A 52-hour live transmission kicking off Monday, November 7th, 2016 at 11 a.m., running right through Election Day the 8th,
[00:21:12.765 --> 00:21:14.325]  End of the night at 3 p.m.
[00:21:14.365 --> 00:21:15.506]  and quite frankly beyond.
[00:21:15.866 --> 00:21:21.887]  It's historical, and it's part of overthrowing the dinosaur media, not just overthrowing the two-party corrupt system.
[00:21:22.387 --> 00:21:28.088]  I want to see 10 million viewers tune in over the 50-plus hours, and that's where you come in.
[00:21:28.528 --> 00:21:30.249]  You are the heart and blood of the InfoWar.
[00:21:30.569 --> 00:21:40.271]  If you spread the link to InfoWars.com forward slash show and point out that this is the alternative new media, this is the rebellion, this is the modern Paul Revere operation,
[00:21:40.871 --> 00:21:44.394]  Then all of you are riding right beside us, not behind us.
[00:21:44.774 --> 00:21:48.177]  So spread the word, my Paul Reveres, no matter where you live in the world.
[00:21:49.538 --> 00:21:54.802]  To Information Warfare Arms, the Globalists are coming, and they will be met on the field.
[00:21:56.643 --> 00:21:57.904]  InfoWars.com.
[00:21:58.264 --> 00:21:58.885]  Powered by 1776.
[00:22:01.027 --> 00:22:05.368]  Military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[00:22:05.748 --> 00:22:08.089]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[00:22:08.169 --> 00:22:11.310]  Of course not, because she's... There's a really loud noise.
[00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:16.831]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[00:22:16.851 --> 00:22:19.072]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[00:22:22.933 --> 00:22:27.314]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:23:03.367 --> 00:23:12.350]  Hillary Clinton's campaign manager John Podesta attends weird occult dinner parties where blood, semen and breast milk are used in ritualistic ceremonies.
[00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:16.211]  No, this isn't a fake news story, it's absolutely real.
[00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:20.773]  And there you were thinking Podesta's UFO obsession was his weirdest hobby.
[00:23:20.993 --> 00:23:30.195]  In an email dated June 28, 2015, performance artist Maria Abramovich wrote to Podesta's brother Tony and said, Tony Podesta then forwarded the email to John Podesta, asking him,
[00:23:44.138 --> 00:23:46.700]  Here's Marina inviting Podesta directly.
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.541]  So what is spirit cooking?
[00:23:48.741 --> 00:23:55.786]  It's basically a Wiccan ceremony where blood is used to create some form of art as a sacrament to occult beliefs.
[00:23:55.987 --> 00:24:08.656]  This video shows Abramovich mixing together thickly congealed blood as the recipe for the painting, which is comprised of the words, with a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand, eat the pain.
[00:24:09.116 --> 00:24:18.284]  Spirit cooking is also an occult practice used during sex cult rituals, as explained in the book, Spirit Cooking with Essential Aphrodisiac Recipes.
[00:24:18.464 --> 00:24:23.869]  According to Maria Abramovich, if the ritual is performed in an art gallery, it's merely art.
[00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:32.056]  But if the ritual is performed privately, as it was with the pedestrians, then it represents an intimate spiritual ceremony.
[00:24:32.296 --> 00:24:42.327]  Here's Abramovich posing with a goat's head dripping in blood, a representation of the occult symbol Baphomet, which is used by numerous secret societies like Freemasonry and the Knights Templar.
[00:24:42.367 --> 00:24:50.236]  Here she is at a spirit cooking event with Lady Garga, eating something with a spoon that's smeared all over the body of a mock corpse.
[00:24:50.516 --> 00:24:53.318]  Here she is with a pentagram carved into her stomach.
[00:24:53.518 --> 00:24:58.862]  But townhall.com says that all this is perfectly normal and we just all need to calm down.
[00:24:59.023 --> 00:25:02.165]  So how is Hillary tied to all this insane weirdness?
[00:25:02.665 --> 00:25:06.788]  Well for one, Podesta is her campaign chairman and they move in the same circles.
[00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:10.551]  Maria Abramovich was invited to Hillary's campaign launch.
[00:25:11.132 --> 00:25:15.375]  And Hillary herself is also known to be into bizarre paranormal practices.
[00:25:15.475 --> 00:25:22.462]  Clinton used to hold seances in the White House to try and contact dead people like Eleanor Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi.
[00:25:22.602 --> 00:25:28.628]  Bill Clinton's book also talks about how him and Hillary used to participate in voodoo rituals in Haiti.
[00:25:28.728 --> 00:25:34.313]  Hillary's mentor is Saul Alinsky, who in his book Rules for Radicals, praises Lucifer.
[00:25:34.514 --> 00:25:38.778]  Should it really surprise us that FBI agents refer to Hillary Clinton
[00:25:39.318 --> 00:25:40.760]  As the Antichrist.
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.864]  How did the Clinton campaign respond to the spirit cooking scandal?
[00:25:45.045 --> 00:25:46.747]  They blamed Vladimir Putin.
[00:25:47.087 --> 00:25:49.490]  Yes, they actually blamed Vladimir Putin.
[00:25:54.255 --> 00:26:04.842]  And if you thought that was weird enough, I haven't even talked about the accusations of child trafficking and pedophilia, which some claim is coded into the Podesta emails under the guise of types of food.
[00:26:05.022 --> 00:26:10.686]  This is some serious bohemian grove, eyes wide shut, satanic style malarkey.
[00:26:10.806 --> 00:26:15.169]  Would you really want these kind of people in control of the nuclear codes?
[00:26:15.409 --> 00:26:24.035]  So John Podesta, Hillary's top guy, likes to engage in occult rituals involving pig's blood, semen and urine, while Donald Trump
[00:26:24.755 --> 00:26:33.838]  Trump likes to eat ice cream, but according to the media, who have refused to cover this story, Donald Trump is the weird, creepy, dangerous one.
[00:26:34.098 --> 00:26:38.919]  So Trump talked about posse ten years ago, and that was a national scandal.
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:43.561]  Clinton campaign insiders involved in satanic rituals as of last year.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.321]  Meh, who cares?
[00:27:02.859 --> 00:27:05.980]  Showing this monkey choosing a presidential candidate.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.782]  They had a couple of standees of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, and they let the monkey pick which one as an indicator of who was going to win the election.
[00:27:13.802 --> 00:27:16.963]  You know, kind of like a Puxatani Phil, you know, on Groundhog Day.
[00:27:17.863 --> 00:27:25.506]  And when I saw it, I thought that was very interesting, but, you know, I looked at it and I thought, there wasn't any explanation on the monkey, and I thought, where is this coming from?
[00:27:25.546 --> 00:27:28.827]  I know that I've been in Chinese restaurants, you know, the really fine restaurants where they give you a paper
[00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:32.674]  Anything in front of you that's got all the different zodiac animals.
[00:27:32.714 --> 00:27:36.061]  There's 12 of them, like the ear of the monkey, the ear of the dragon, the ear of the rabbit, that sort of thing.
[00:27:36.382 --> 00:27:37.825]  Then there's also some modifiers.
[00:27:38.433 --> 00:27:42.175]  And so they have five modifiers, like metal, earth, wind, fire, that type of thing.
[00:27:42.735 --> 00:27:44.136]  So it's actually got a 60-year cycle.
[00:27:44.196 --> 00:27:47.458]  We haven't had this year of the monkey, the fire monkey, since 1956.
[00:27:48.338 --> 00:27:51.480]  So 2016 is the year of the fire monkey.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:57.564]  And when you look at it, it says, the fire monkey is ambitious, adventurous, and irritable.
[00:27:57.584 --> 00:27:59.625]  I thought, oh, that's Donald Trump.
[00:28:00.945 --> 00:28:03.227]  Ambitious, adventurous, and irritable.
[00:28:03.807 --> 00:28:06.849]  But you know, it's also kind of like maybe as in, you're fired.
[00:28:07.569 --> 00:28:11.133]  But Hillary Clinton has got more monkeys than that on her side.
[00:28:11.153 --> 00:28:16.559]  You know, when Drudge linked to this story, the picture actually, he linked directly to Getty Images.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.982]  And that link disappeared.
[00:28:19.322 --> 00:28:22.966]  And it actually disappeared off the Drudge Report for a while, and then it reappeared with another article.
[00:28:23.026 --> 00:28:27.311]  Somebody had embedded the Getty Images into their article, so he linked to that again.
[00:28:28.251 --> 00:28:35.454]  This is kind of a funny story, and I thought, you know, why would they take down a link that Drudge had sent to that?
[00:28:35.955 --> 00:28:37.415]  Most people want Drudge traffic, right?
[00:28:37.455 --> 00:28:41.377]  But not the mainstream media if it says something positive about Donald Trump, evidently.
[00:28:41.978 --> 00:28:48.541]  Because, see, Donald Trump may have one monkey on his side, but Hillary Clinton's got three important monkeys on her side.
[00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:52.083]  The see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil monkeys.
[00:28:52.243 --> 00:28:54.124]  That's the monkeys that are on Hillary Clinton's side.
[00:28:54.424 --> 00:28:56.406]  And that's how they're monkeying with this election.
[00:28:56.466 --> 00:28:58.967]  Okay, let's take a look at the pollsters.
[00:28:58.987 --> 00:29:03.450]  You know, we're constantly told that Hillary Clinton has got it all sewn up.
[00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:10.534]  First, she had this massive lead, according to the pollsters, even though we've got all these other metrics that show that's not the case.
[00:29:10.995 --> 00:29:15.438]  Of course, we've got the situation with the massive crowds that show up for Donald Trump's rallies.
[00:29:15.858 --> 00:29:17.299]  But then we have other things like this.
[00:29:17.859 --> 00:29:35.190]  We've got, and this was reported by CNN, first we had one high school in Minnesota, and then we had a statewide referendum, and this was actually talked about by Don Lemon and Kayleigh McEnany by talking about 77,000 high school students in Minnesota selecting Donald Trump.
[00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:36.091]  Now that's significant.
[00:29:37.062 --> 00:29:42.404]  See, when you have high school students selecting that, that's usually representative of what they're hearing at home.
[00:29:43.045 --> 00:29:46.006]  It does a very good job of representing what the parents are saying.
[00:29:46.406 --> 00:29:49.427]  Perhaps more so than these so-called scientific polls.
[00:29:49.827 --> 00:29:53.389]  Because the scientific polls don't include the unlikely voters.
[00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:56.071]  That's going to give us, I think, an unlikely result.
[00:29:56.391 --> 00:29:57.191]  But it can be stolen.
[00:29:57.231 --> 00:29:58.332]  But we've got all these other metrics.
[00:29:58.352 --> 00:30:01.634]  We've got the AI algorithm that we reported on this last week.
[00:30:01.654 --> 00:30:04.036]  We've got other non-polling algorithms that look at it.
[00:30:04.456 --> 00:30:10.200]  And then, of course, we see the massive numbers of people switching from Democrat to Republican in places like Pennsylvania.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:23.724]  The massive numbers of new voters, people who've never voted in their lives, all these different types of things, as well as a record number of votes for Donald Trump during the primary season, a record number of contributions under $200 for Donald Trump.
[00:30:23.884 --> 00:30:24.725]  Never seen that before.
[00:30:25.005 --> 00:30:28.686]  And of course, the Republican establishment has not given a cent to Donald Trump.
[00:30:29.286 --> 00:30:34.389]  They've given $50 million to Mitt Romney, to John McCain in the last two presidential cycles.
[00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:39.232]  They gave nothing to Donald Trump and they spent nothing to attack Hillary Clinton.
[00:30:39.252 --> 00:30:40.152]  Think about that for a moment.
[00:30:40.693 --> 00:30:45.515]  The establishment Republican Party spent $0 to attack Hillary Clinton.
[00:30:46.136 --> 00:30:49.217]  I think that's really a $50 million contribution to Hillary Clinton.
[00:30:50.158 --> 00:30:51.499]  But when we look at this,
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:59.642]  I think we see that, and of course there's also another story from Drudge, about where do the pollsters and the journalists lie?
[00:30:59.662 --> 00:31:09.244]  Okay, we've had a lot of revelations in the last couple of weeks going through and looking how journalists, reporters, news editors, so forth, what percentage of them are contributing to Democrats or Republicans?
[00:31:09.284 --> 00:31:12.404]  Well, it's about 96% contribute to the Democrats.
[00:31:12.444 --> 00:31:18.666]  But in this particular story that was linked by Drudge, they went through and they drilled down to the survey organizations.
[00:31:18.706 --> 00:31:19.126]  And guess what?
[00:31:20.646 --> 00:31:21.507]  SurveyMonkey.
[00:31:21.807 --> 00:31:23.348]  There's the monkeys again.
[00:31:23.868 --> 00:31:25.169]  NBC's SurveyMonkey.
[00:31:25.289 --> 00:31:26.790]  Zero dollars to Trump.
[00:31:27.731 --> 00:31:32.074]  96% of their contributions go to Democrat candidates.
[00:31:32.394 --> 00:31:34.976]  The chief executive officer of SurveyMonkey.
[00:31:34.996 --> 00:31:35.296]  $72,000 to Clinton.
[00:31:35.316 --> 00:31:35.837]  $30,000 to the DNC in 2016.
[00:31:35.877 --> 00:31:36.457]  100 grand from their CEO.
[00:31:36.477 --> 00:31:37.678]  SurveyMonkey's senior VP of global sales.
[00:31:37.698 --> 00:31:38.078]  $65,000 to Clinton.
[00:31:38.098 --> 00:31:39.099]  $30,000 to the DNC.
[00:31:39.119 --> 00:31:39.599]  Both of them.
[00:31:49.386 --> 00:31:49.526]  About
[00:32:04.827 --> 00:32:06.548]  Donald Trump doesn't have a chance.
[00:32:06.628 --> 00:32:09.009]  And as I pointed out before, look at the crowd situation.
[00:32:09.409 --> 00:32:12.750]  Hillary Clinton is getting such minuscule crowds.
[00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:19.313]  She's got emails talking about how if it's less than 100 people, absolutely no cameras or recording devices.
[00:32:19.633 --> 00:32:22.995]  That's the kind of crowds she and Bill Clinton are playing to.
[00:32:23.155 --> 00:32:28.477]  That's one of the key things when we had this contest of people with the Bill Clinton rape t-shirt.
[00:32:28.577 --> 00:32:30.198]  One of the most valuable things about that.
[00:32:30.678 --> 00:32:38.741]  Was that as these people are being taken out of the venue, the camera would pan around and you could actually see the size of the crowd that the media will not report.
[00:32:39.081 --> 00:32:41.642]  Just take a look at this Miami concert that we had this last week.
[00:32:41.682 --> 00:32:46.383]  Jennifer Lopez warming up for Hillary Clinton and they don't say how many people are there.
[00:32:46.683 --> 00:32:56.807]  With Jennifer Lopez fanning her, putting her fanny out there in this suggestive pose, okay, that it would flip out the Democrats and yet all they say is a crowd of thousands.
[00:32:56.947 --> 00:32:59.988]  That's the way they're monkeying with the elections.
[00:33:11.952 --> 00:33:19.879]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:19.919 --> 00:33:21.881]  Now, this is our 20th product.
[00:33:22.642 --> 00:33:29.548]  We can easily go out to a major vitamin or supplement company and private label a thousand different products.
[00:33:30.148 --> 00:33:35.954]  But it's taken us four plus years to even come out with 20 because we private label some, but we also develop
[00:33:36.818 --> 00:33:43.976]  Many of the products originally were some of the top labs in the country, so that they're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[00:33:44.755 --> 00:33:46.596]  And they're also very affordable.
[00:33:46.616 --> 00:33:46.936]  Exactly.
[00:33:46.956 --> 00:33:48.736]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[00:33:48.776 --> 00:33:52.098]  You talk about we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[00:33:52.138 --> 00:33:53.418]  We've both thought we've talked to them.
[00:33:53.718 --> 00:33:59.620]  They have conveyor belts of herbs falling on the ground and they have someone come and sweep them up and put them back on the conveyor belt.
[00:33:59.961 --> 00:34:08.924]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[00:34:09.805 --> 00:34:10.906]  We refuse to screw people.
[00:34:11.246 --> 00:34:12.227]  We refuse to do that.
[00:34:12.607 --> 00:34:14.629]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:17.292]  We're producing something we want to take.
[00:34:17.372 --> 00:34:17.833]  Exactly.
[00:34:17.933 --> 00:34:19.214]  We're looking for the best.
[00:34:19.274 --> 00:34:24.139]  We went out and searched for the best to private label and most of the time found out it wasn't available.
[00:34:24.359 --> 00:34:28.143]  So we go to these big firms and say we want to make the dream formula.
[00:34:28.183 --> 00:34:31.986]  Yes, and in this case, with Bio-PCA, there's nothing out there that is what we wanted.
[00:34:32.226 --> 00:34:33.067]  So we made our own.
[00:34:33.167 --> 00:34:35.689]  We went with chemists and scientists and we actually created this formula.
[00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:39.372]  And it's a proprietary blend, as in, you're not going to get this anywhere else.
[00:34:39.732 --> 00:34:45.737]  Bio-PCA, for example, one of the ingredients is silica, and it's from bamboo extract.
[00:34:46.017 --> 00:34:47.258]  It's everywhere.
[00:34:47.419 --> 00:34:48.079]  It's in nature.
[00:34:48.339 --> 00:34:50.101]  It's an essential part of being healthy, right?
[00:34:50.621 --> 00:34:56.666]  Just this bottle of silica, again, one ingredient, in a lower amount than even in our product, is $35.
[00:34:57.887 --> 00:35:03.130]  They're charging more than what we charge when they have one ingredient that's less than ours.
[00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.831]  This is insane.
[00:35:03.851 --> 00:35:13.036]  When I told him we wanted 10,000 micrograms, he goes, okay, I get that you guys want to do, you know, high power stuff, but why don't you just do 3,000 and then you can sell, you know, multiple bottles of it.
[00:35:13.056 --> 00:35:13.937]  People will buy more of it.
[00:35:14.057 --> 00:35:14.877]  I was like, no, let's do 10.
[00:35:14.997 --> 00:35:15.177]  Okay.
[00:35:15.638 --> 00:35:16.518]  Compare that to this.
[00:35:16.738 --> 00:35:18.139]  This is a $50 product.
[00:35:18.439 --> 00:35:21.641]  One of the leaders in the industry has 3,000 micrograms of biotin.
[00:35:21.661 --> 00:35:21.962]  Okay.
[00:35:22.002 --> 00:35:22.182]  We have 10,000.
[00:35:22.262 --> 00:35:23.202]  This is $50, $48 to be exact.
[00:35:26.144 --> 00:35:31.206]  Obviously, if it's making the hair, the skin, the nails healthier, what is it doing in the body?
[00:35:31.426 --> 00:35:32.366]  It's systematic, right?
[00:35:32.506 --> 00:35:37.687]  So obviously, if your skin and your hairs and your nails are looking better, then you're at the root level changing things.
[00:35:38.068 --> 00:35:39.708]  I want products I'm going to use for my family.
[00:35:39.908 --> 00:35:40.488]  I take this.
[00:35:40.908 --> 00:35:41.949]  My family takes this.
[00:35:42.509 --> 00:35:47.350]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find anywhere.
[00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:48.831]  So what you find in our information
[00:35:49.671 --> 00:35:53.494]  In our news, it's the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:53.514 --> 00:36:01.599]  Bio PCA Hair and Nails Formula, available at Infowarslife.com today, or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:01.619 --> 00:36:04.241]  There's no script, no teleprompter, I'll be honest with you.
[00:36:04.661 --> 00:36:07.023]  My problem is, with 20 products now,
[00:36:08.499 --> 00:36:09.920]  It's remembering to take them all.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.762]  Because when I do, I have great days, great weeks, a great life.
[00:36:14.203 --> 00:36:22.908]  When I forget to take the X2, a super male, or the lung cleanse, or to do a liver cleanse, or to take this product, my quality of life just isn't as good.
[00:36:22.988 --> 00:36:24.069]  It's changed my life.
[00:36:24.169 --> 00:36:26.410]  I looked like Jabba the Hutt four years ago.
[00:36:26.751 --> 00:36:28.632]  I was swimming two miles some days a day.
[00:36:29.032 --> 00:36:30.473]  I was jogging, lifting weights.
[00:36:30.533 --> 00:36:31.354]  I couldn't lose the weight.
[00:36:32.279 --> 00:36:39.349]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:40.511]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:40.971 --> 00:36:41.752]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:53.197]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[00:37:53.738 --> 00:38:05.406]  And others who are kind of at the very fringe of the conspiracy movement like Alex Jones are being kind of incorporated into the campaign in ways it's a, or even the recent choices of campaign management.
[00:38:05.706 --> 00:38:10.830]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle, as we've been chronicling here.
[00:38:10.871 --> 00:38:16.015]  Jones is the conspiracy theorist and creator of the fringe website Infowars.
[00:38:16.375 --> 00:38:19.418]  Do you also know that Hillary Clinton uses a wheelchair?
[00:38:20.479 --> 00:38:26.544]  Her personal vehicle has had to be outfitted with a wheelchair lift because she is not a person who can actually walk.
[00:38:27.325 --> 00:38:30.407]  She secretly uses a wheelchair all those times you think you've seen her walking.
[00:38:30.447 --> 00:38:31.368]  She hasn't been walking.
[00:38:31.568 --> 00:38:32.069]  Did you know that?
[00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:35.872]  Hillary Clinton has been on the campaign trail for 18 months.
[00:38:35.973 --> 00:38:38.535]  Her energy staggers me.
[00:38:39.235 --> 00:38:40.817]  I have a hard time keeping up with her.
[00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:49.852]  The historical first in electing the first conspiracy freak president.
[00:38:50.113 --> 00:38:51.593]  He's not pivoting for presidential.
[00:38:51.813 --> 00:38:53.414]  He's pivoting to Alex Jones.
[00:38:53.454 --> 00:38:54.795]  He's pivoting to crazy.
[00:38:55.295 --> 00:38:59.798]  Was Hillary wearing an earpiece during last night's presidential forum?
[00:39:00.558 --> 00:39:09.843]  That is the pilot, the captain of America's conspiracy theory mothership, Alex Jones.
[00:39:09.883 --> 00:39:12.024]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you Alex?
[00:39:13.331 --> 00:39:14.512]  The plan was so simple.
[00:39:14.612 --> 00:39:18.955]  All Hillary had to do was open a jar of pickles and the White House would be all ours.
[00:39:18.975 --> 00:39:21.456]  You're going to be part of the conspiracy now, you realize that, right?
[00:39:21.496 --> 00:39:22.477]  I'm going to try to do my best.
[00:39:22.657 --> 00:39:24.378]  Alex Jones is going to be all over you.
[00:39:24.398 --> 00:39:25.139]  Let's see what happens.
[00:39:25.179 --> 00:39:26.019]  Okay, here we go.
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:27.260]  Here it is.
[00:39:27.961 --> 00:39:28.621]  Whoa, blitzer.
[00:39:29.361 --> 00:39:29.742]  Oh, no.
[00:39:31.743 --> 00:39:38.427]  Oh, there was a... They are all in on this total conspiracy theory that literally came from Infowars.
[00:39:38.768 --> 00:39:40.649]  First of all, Hayes, I'll get you for this segment.
[00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:45.722]  It may take years and cost thousands of lives, but I'll get you for this.
[00:39:46.062 --> 00:39:55.889]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:59.272]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[00:40:02.494 --> 00:40:05.476]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:40:05.856 --> 00:40:07.557]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:40:07.978 --> 00:40:10.860]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:40:11.772 --> 00:40:15.295]  And it matters because it's not just the kook fringe.
[00:40:15.355 --> 00:40:21.821]  It's not just the sort of remunerative conspiracy theory world of that part of the conservative media machine.
[00:40:22.122 --> 00:40:27.086]  It's not even just wacky people who have made their way into Republican politics at a surprising height.
[00:40:27.327 --> 00:40:29.068]  This is now the top of the Republican ticket.
[00:40:51.010 --> 00:41:04.445]  Marina Abramovich, grandmother of the performance art movement and a modern adherent to ceremonial magic found in Aleister Crowley's religion, Thelema, wrote a very personal email to Tony Podesta, according to WikiLeaks.
[00:41:04.745 --> 00:41:10.372]  It reads, Dear Tony, I am so looking forward to the spirit cooking dinner at my place.
[00:41:10.612 --> 00:41:28.344]  Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining Tony Podesta, regarded as the most powerful lobbyist in Washington, D.C., is a brother to none other than John Podesta, chairman of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and counselor to President Obama.
[00:41:28.644 --> 00:41:33.986]  That dinner Abramovich spoke of was nothing less than a thelemic occult ritual.
[00:41:34.246 --> 00:41:43.929]  In spirit cooking, Marina uses pig's blood, which most resembles human blood, as a medium to connect the spirit world with the material world.
[00:41:44.169 --> 00:41:48.510]  The ritual takes place in the kitchen, which is considered to be the heart of the home.
[00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:54.152]  The goal of the ceremony is to convert matter into energy so spirits can feed on it.
[00:41:54.372 --> 00:42:05.428]  Marina derives her inspiration from the popular belief that spirits still need food even though it is no longer solid but in the form of light, sound, and emotions.
[00:42:05.876 --> 00:42:17.780]  This simple revelation may finally pull back the curtain to the masses on the ugly truth Infowars and others have been desperately trying to tell the masses for years.
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:20.941]  The occult is the religion of the elite.
[00:42:21.261 --> 00:42:25.102]  Just research the influence of Lucius Trust in the United Nations.
[00:42:25.402 --> 00:42:28.203]  Or review the 1990 Nebraska U.S.
[00:42:28.263 --> 00:42:38.087]  District Court case between Paul A. Baraki vs. Lawrence E. King, exposing a powerful pedophile ring linked to political figures, high-level U.S.
[00:42:38.147 --> 00:42:41.128]  military commanders, and the intelligence establishment.
[00:42:41.348 --> 00:42:45.169]  All of this overseen by Temple of Set founder and retired U.S.
[00:42:45.249 --> 00:42:45.910]  Army Lt.
[00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:46.290]  Col.
[00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:47.350]  Michael Aquino.
[00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:51.992]  Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton live in this dark world.
[00:42:52.432 --> 00:43:09.325]  Bill Clinton wrote in his biography that the brief foray into the world of voodoo furthered his fascination with the way different cultures try to make sense of life, nature, and the virtually universal belief that there is a non-physical spirit force at work in the world.
[00:43:09.525 --> 00:43:23.155]  Back in September 16, 2016, Fox News posted a letter from hacker Goosifer, claiming the goal of the Goosifer Project failed because he was unable to fully expose the Illuminati, the Council, and their crimes.
[00:43:23.575 --> 00:43:31.541]  He writes, Hillary Rodham Diane Clinton is one of the High Priests, a goddess of this occult, satanic, shadow group.
[00:43:31.881 --> 00:43:37.025]  One must see their evil and profoundly corrupt nature to understand what I am talking about.
[00:43:37.165 --> 00:43:45.908]  Guccifer continues, so I apologize in front of the unknown soldiers who struggle to take this fight against these monsters to a glorious end.
[00:43:46.288 --> 00:43:53.110]  Many of them are risking their lives while doing this behind the computer screens from inside or outside the system.
[00:43:53.530 --> 00:44:04.034]  And now bombshell revelations are surfacing from Anthony Weiner's recovered laptop as the New York Police Department is investigating allegations that Bill Clinton
[00:44:04.454 --> 00:44:09.616]  ...perform sexual acts on underage girls as young as five years old.
[00:44:10.076 --> 00:44:23.142]  In the coming days, right up to the election, Anthony Weiner's laptop will reveal evidence of an international child sex trafficking ring tied to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
[00:44:23.903 --> 00:44:29.885]  She's worked like a demon, as you know, as Secretary of State and as a senator and in the years since.
[00:44:30.265 --> 00:44:31.546]  One thing about Hillary,
[00:44:33.339 --> 00:44:35.181]  Bill was just a good-timing guy.
[00:44:36.222 --> 00:44:39.826]  But Hillary, she's an animal.
[00:44:40.287 --> 00:44:46.013]  Hillary is the one that I promise you, she pulls the strings.
[00:44:46.694 --> 00:44:48.776]  She pulled them in Arkansas.
[00:44:49.036 --> 00:44:52.300]  She pulled them in the White House when she was there as the First Lady.
[00:44:54.477 --> 00:45:03.283]  If all of this is just a little too much, remember, Benjamin Franklin prophetically said, only a virtuous people are capable of freedom.
[00:45:03.343 --> 00:45:06.926]  As nations become corrupt and vicious, they have more need of masters.
[00:45:33.548 --> 00:45:44.317]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[00:45:44.657 --> 00:45:46.899]  It's time to stop submitting to this tyranny!
[00:45:47.019 --> 00:45:49.201]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[00:45:49.761 --> 00:45:52.524]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[00:45:54.056 --> 00:45:56.738]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[00:45:56.938 --> 00:46:00.520]  Tyranny, with a capital T. You should reject these voices.
[00:46:01.281 --> 00:46:20.314]  Everything that's been done, with torture, rendition, the NDAA, the Patriot Acts 1 and 2, from day one, was focused on the American people, period.
[00:46:21.735 --> 00:46:22.155]  That's it.
[00:46:23.303 --> 00:46:31.831]  It's always been about erasing the Bill of Rights and Constitution and rolling out NSA spying publicly, saying it's for Al Qaeda.
[00:46:32.251 --> 00:46:36.335]  Rolling out torture, saying it's for Al Qaeda, but it's really for the general public.
[00:46:36.695 --> 00:46:45.283]  Rolling out total control and the end of any underground free market systems in the name of fighting Al Qaeda, but really shutting down any type of free commerce.
[00:46:45.744 --> 00:46:47.706]  This is all about converting us
[00:46:48.226 --> 00:46:53.765]  From a free society to a tyranny with a capital T.
[00:47:02.978 --> 00:47:07.962]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.244 --> 00:48:52.725]  I don't know.
[00:49:05.029 --> 00:49:09.752]  Well we're just four days away from finding out who will be the new leader of the free world.
[00:49:09.792 --> 00:49:12.814]  Will it be Donald Trump or the Queen Demon herself?
[00:49:13.275 --> 00:49:21.500]  Now everyone knows this has been a hotly contested election cycle and of course it wouldn't be complete without a little bit of fear mongering up to the last minute.
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:27.544]  So now we have US Intel warning of possible Al Qaeda attacks in the US on Monday.
[00:49:27.584 --> 00:49:28.044]  Now these are
[00:49:29.345 --> 00:49:30.566]  They're still being assessed.
[00:49:30.926 --> 00:49:36.549]  They haven't been confirmed, but they're saying New York, Texas, and Virginia are all possible targets.
[00:49:36.949 --> 00:49:38.731]  No specific locations are mentioned.
[00:49:39.051 --> 00:49:40.652]  So just throwing it out there.
[00:49:40.732 --> 00:49:41.552]  No specifics.
[00:49:42.012 --> 00:49:44.934]  Possibility there could be some terror attacks from Al-Qaeda.
[00:49:46.395 --> 00:49:48.056]  What rock did they crawl out from under?
[00:49:48.536 --> 00:49:59.544]  Well, Leanne, we know that we covered this on Monday in the Nightly News, and this year now, which is ISIS, their magazine, in French, English, and Arabic, they said, anybody living in the U.S.
[00:49:59.664 --> 00:50:05.489]  or Western Europe, we're calling on you to shoot them in the heads, basically, I'm paraphrasing, and cut them at the neck.
[00:50:05.869 --> 00:50:06.709]  You are privileged.
[00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:07.770]  You're a privileged few.
[00:50:08.131 --> 00:50:09.291]  We're here from afar.
[00:50:09.351 --> 00:50:09.852]  You're there.
[00:50:09.992 --> 00:50:13.935]  And they're trying to activate these terror cells within the United States, specifically
[00:50:14.275 --> 00:50:17.196]  I don't think it's coincidental that it's happening around our election time.
[00:50:17.236 --> 00:50:20.017]  That's interesting that the fear-mongering would hit.
[00:50:20.037 --> 00:50:22.498]  But if this is a fake story, that's another thing.
[00:50:22.538 --> 00:50:24.259]  But this is Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:24.339 --> 00:50:27.160]  This isn't ISIS who's been putting out these active threats.
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:28.961]  Why all of a sudden Al-Qaeda?
[00:50:29.001 --> 00:50:34.543]  Are they a little bit jealous that ISIS has kind of stolen the spotlight from them with their terror attacks?
[00:50:35.023 --> 00:50:37.344]  I mean, I thought that they were contained.
[00:50:37.424 --> 00:50:38.325]  I mean, what do you think, Owen?
[00:50:39.565 --> 00:50:44.988]  Well, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, ISIL, IS, you know, they'll change the name a hundred times.
[00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:46.409]  Al-Nusra, the proxy army.
[00:50:46.609 --> 00:50:50.932]  Yeah, so who knows, you know, who knows who's really, where these details are coming from.
[00:50:51.192 --> 00:50:57.896]  They're saying that a senior investigator with CBS, Pat Millen, has been told from his U.S.
[00:50:57.936 --> 00:51:05.701]  intelligence sources that the Alert Joint Terrorism Task Force has been warned that Al-Qaeda could be planning attacks
[00:51:06.221 --> 00:51:08.182]  In these three states that you mentioned, U.S.
[00:51:08.222 --> 00:51:12.263]  authorities are taking the threat seriously, but its credibility hasn't been confirmed.
[00:51:12.543 --> 00:51:17.405]  But I think obviously what we're all sitting here wondering is, why the timing?
[00:51:17.485 --> 00:51:18.085]  Why now?
[00:51:18.705 --> 00:51:25.708]  Is this a fake story to drum up fear for what reason we can deliberate on?
[00:51:25.908 --> 00:51:33.790]  Is this truly radical Islamic terror trying to incite attacks on United States ground the day before the election?
[00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:35.471]  And then what is the reason for that?
[00:51:35.931 --> 00:51:37.012]  Why would they want to do that?
[00:51:56.389 --> 00:52:03.013]  We look at our politicians, they have no problem handing you the whole basket of our foreign policy, what we're going to do, especially Hillary Clinton.
[00:52:03.153 --> 00:52:04.354]  Donald Trump has never done that.
[00:52:04.374 --> 00:52:05.815]  He said, I'm not giving away our strategy.
[00:52:06.035 --> 00:52:07.196]  She has no problem doing that.
[00:52:07.216 --> 00:52:10.218]  But when it comes to specifics like this, it is so intentionally vague.
[00:52:10.438 --> 00:52:15.021]  One counterterrorism expert has indicated, okay, it just hasn't been confirmed.
[00:52:15.101 --> 00:52:18.543]  Nothing to worry about, but you could be facing a potential terror attack.
[00:52:18.823 --> 00:52:22.144]  Well, I think we gotta, again, we have to find out what would the motive be?
[00:52:22.184 --> 00:52:25.565]  What would the motive be for terrorists to attack the day before an election?
[00:52:25.625 --> 00:52:27.545]  Is that trying to alter the election?
[00:52:27.905 --> 00:52:30.526]  What is the deal if the US government is trying to fearmonger?
[00:52:30.606 --> 00:52:32.926]  Are they trying to get Trump supporters not to show up?
[00:52:32.946 --> 00:52:34.087]  I mean, what is the motive here?
[00:52:34.887 --> 00:52:36.727]  You know, we can sit here, is this a real threat?
[00:52:36.787 --> 00:52:37.247]  Is it not?
[00:52:37.387 --> 00:52:38.928]  Obviously, we don't know.
[00:52:39.008 --> 00:52:40.448]  We don't have the intel.
[00:52:41.228 --> 00:52:45.249]  We already saw what happened the last time they threatened a terror attack here in Texas.
[00:52:45.269 --> 00:52:46.390]  So, you know.
[00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:47.730]  Didn't go too well for them, did it?
[00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:48.591]  Bring it.
[00:52:51.253 --> 00:52:52.074]  Come and take it.
[00:52:52.515 --> 00:52:54.677]  Well, so let's kind of moving on now.
[00:52:55.057 --> 00:52:56.819]  We're still kind of running through these WikiLeaks.
[00:52:56.839 --> 00:53:00.063]  I know that they just did even the last one.
[00:53:00.083 --> 00:53:02.405]  I think they just released 30 more emails today.
[00:53:02.485 --> 00:53:08.631]  And of course, we're going to be talking about this supposed alleged terror attack and not, of course, the freaking
[00:53:09.272 --> 00:53:09.572]  I think.
[00:53:27.242 --> 00:53:29.043]  Totally losing it with the crowd.
[00:53:29.103 --> 00:53:30.763]  He has zero control over them.
[00:53:31.163 --> 00:53:32.984]  Nobody respects him in other countries.
[00:53:33.084 --> 00:53:35.785]  Leaders from other countries, now not even people at his own rally.
[00:53:36.925 --> 00:53:46.968]  But we have these strategists for these campaigns basically behind their back saying, here's one, with practice, Hillary will eventually sound human.
[00:53:47.168 --> 00:53:48.329]  I don't think so.
[00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:51.710]  This Neera Tanden, she's been kind of, her emails are a little bit snippy.
[00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:53.631]  I wonder what kind of backlash she's gotten.
[00:53:53.691 --> 00:53:54.971]  These emails have come out.
[00:53:55.191 --> 00:53:56.953]  I'd get a bullet.
[00:53:56.973 --> 00:53:59.256]  Guys, she might sound human with practice.
[00:53:59.296 --> 00:53:59.997]  With a little practice.
[00:54:00.017 --> 00:54:00.737]  That's the kicker here.
[00:54:00.797 --> 00:54:01.478]  She might.
[00:54:01.739 --> 00:54:02.319]  So what does that mean?
[00:54:02.339 --> 00:54:03.040]  She's not human?
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:04.462]  Are they admitting she's not human?
[00:54:04.722 --> 00:54:05.903]  Do we have it in the WikiLeaks?
[00:54:06.324 --> 00:54:07.205]  We've got everything else.
[00:54:07.265 --> 00:54:08.086]  Well, that's what Alex said.
[00:54:08.126 --> 00:54:09.027]  Manchurian candidate.
[00:54:10.248 --> 00:54:24.792]  As you all know, who've been watching us all day long, we've been knee-deep in the most horrific garbage imaginable in these WikiLeaks emails involving John Podesta, sex crimes against children, these weird occultic practices, and it's so, as you put it, demonic.
[00:54:24.832 --> 00:54:25.272]  Alleged.
[00:54:25.752 --> 00:54:26.653]  Alleged.
[00:54:26.713 --> 00:54:27.233]  Pardon me.
[00:54:27.353 --> 00:54:27.773]  Alleged.
[00:54:27.793 --> 00:54:27.953]  It's art.
[00:54:27.973 --> 00:54:28.673]  And they have names.
[00:54:28.713 --> 00:54:29.193]  It's art.
[00:54:29.213 --> 00:54:29.694]  It's art.
[00:54:29.894 --> 00:54:35.295]  But specifically, I just want to highlight this one case because it was so incredibly hard to stomach reading it.
[00:54:35.755 --> 00:54:38.196]  Three little girls were mentioned in one of these alleged emails.
[00:54:38.496 --> 00:54:40.696]  They were 11, 9, and 7 years old.
[00:54:41.797 --> 00:54:43.717]  And they had to throw the age in there too.
[00:54:43.757 --> 00:54:44.437]  What's up with that?
[00:54:44.457 --> 00:54:45.337]  Offered up as entertainment.
[00:54:45.637 --> 00:54:48.558]  And underscore, they will be in that pool.
[00:54:48.758 --> 00:54:48.978]  Right.
[00:54:49.578 --> 00:54:55.759]  How disgustingly, you know, your stomach turns when you read these and you just hope and pray to God, you want these to be hacked emails.
[00:54:55.799 --> 00:54:57.379]  You don't want these things to be true.
[00:54:57.399 --> 00:54:59.160]  I mean, God forbid.
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:02.360]  No one is speaking out about them.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:07.081]  We always kind of look and see, have any of these outlets mentioned Alex Jones?
[00:55:08.081 --> 00:55:10.903]  Search through Google, whatever, to see, are they making fun of us?
[00:55:10.943 --> 00:55:13.245]  Are they trying to, you know, debunk some stories we're putting out there?
[00:55:13.785 --> 00:55:14.325]  Zero.
[00:55:14.526 --> 00:55:16.487]  Radio silence on this.
[00:55:17.087 --> 00:55:19.669]  They're putting it out there as this insane story.
[00:55:19.729 --> 00:55:28.695]  I actually had someone send me a message on Facebook talking about, well, you know, everyone's raised on breast milk and, you know, some people like the taste of that.
[00:55:28.856 --> 00:55:31.617]  And it's totally, blood is natural and it'll help.
[00:55:32.478 --> 00:55:36.561]  Dude, what is wrong with you freaking lefty insane people?
[00:55:36.681 --> 00:55:41.865]  Sure, if you're into that occult stuff, fine, go for it, but you don't need to be doing that in the White House.
[00:55:42.545 --> 00:55:48.970]  Or, you know, the child aspect of this for me, you know, there is a special place in hell for people that harm children.
[00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:50.211]  I firmly believe that.
[00:55:50.931 --> 00:55:54.393]  We're talking about government officials in high positions here.
[00:55:54.433 --> 00:55:57.894]  We're not talking about, you know, the convicted sex offender down the street.
[00:55:57.914 --> 00:56:07.319]  We're talking about people that hold the highest offices we have in this land, and they're accused of doing despicable things with little girls.
[00:56:07.619 --> 00:56:07.819]  Right.
[00:56:07.879 --> 00:56:10.220]  And Alex has talked about this for years.
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:11.781]  People have called him crazy.
[00:56:11.821 --> 00:56:15.382]  But here, lo and behold, you know, it's right there in black and white in these emails.
[00:56:15.823 --> 00:56:19.524]  And that's something that he's talked about, how they'll set up
[00:56:21.085 --> 00:56:23.327]  I mean, this is absolutely insane.
[00:56:42.703 --> 00:56:53.968]  Interesting to see this this coup that's going on where we do have these patriot FBI agents that are saying, you know what, look, we're going to feed you the intel that you need to take this thing down.
[00:56:54.328 --> 00:56:55.729]  And we've got to do it before the election.
[00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:57.870]  And NYPD officers, you mentioned the FBI.
[00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:59.390]  Those men are brave.
[00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:10.315]  You know, they're the reason we have these stories to begin with, not the WikiLeaks dump, but the the emails pertaining to Huma Abedin, her husband, her rotten egg husband and Hillary Clinton.
[00:57:10.695 --> 00:57:30.247]  It's the NYPD, and the word on the street, it's trending on Facebook, and I apologize, I know we weren't going to talk about this, but the DOJ supposedly has threatened the NYPD that, you know, they're going to indict related to an, you know, something that isn't related to this, the death of a victim, you know, in their city, in the event that they go ahead and arrest Wiener.
[00:57:30.287 --> 00:57:37.371]  There seems to be an internal war going on, and yet again... And so the Blackwater founder speaking out, former Navy SEAL Eric Prince,
[00:57:37.651 --> 00:57:38.952]  I mean it's fine.
[00:57:38.972 --> 00:57:42.473]  If you have the smoking gun, if you have the information that's out there, put it out there.
[00:57:42.513 --> 00:57:43.393]  You are saving children's lives.
[00:57:43.433 --> 00:57:45.074]  Not only are you saving this country,
[00:57:59.659 --> 00:58:04.082]  Well, I think we may have just found the answer to the question that we posed at the beginning of the segment here.
[00:58:04.562 --> 00:58:05.382]  Why the timing?
[00:58:05.462 --> 00:58:06.683]  Why the threats of Al Qaeda?
[00:58:06.723 --> 00:58:07.764]  Why are they releasing this now?
[00:58:07.844 --> 00:58:10.425]  Why are they trying to fearmonger over terror?
[00:58:10.445 --> 00:58:18.290]  Oh, because we just got the emails exposing the satanic cult rituals that the Democratic Party is involved in!
[00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:19.391]  Shocking!
[00:58:19.631 --> 00:58:21.672]  This is how we tie these things together, folks.
[00:58:21.772 --> 00:58:23.213]  It's not a coincidence.
[00:58:23.593 --> 00:58:34.723]  I think the fact that they released this report on a possible terrorist attack on the eve of the WikiLeaks emails exposing the satanic occultism, which who knows how long this goes back, folks.
[00:58:34.863 --> 00:58:40.929]  We could be talking about centuries of this stuff going back, but now they want to distract from that with the possible terror threat.
[00:58:41.269 --> 00:58:41.449]  Right.
[00:58:41.689 --> 00:58:42.530]  Just do your part.
[00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:44.392]  These people cannot remain in power.
[00:58:44.432 --> 00:58:47.134]  We're looking at, you know, T-minus three days out here.
[00:58:47.254 --> 00:58:48.395]  They cannot stay.
[00:58:48.595 --> 00:58:49.196]  Absolutely.
[00:58:49.476 --> 00:58:50.537]  Thank you guys so much.
[00:58:50.617 --> 00:58:52.619]  And thank you all for tuning in to the show tonight.
[00:58:52.919 --> 00:58:53.860]  Have a great weekend.
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:54.981]  We will see you here Monday.
[00:58:55.021 --> 00:58:58.844]  We're starting our epic 52-hour broadcast with the Alex Jones Show, Monday.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.932]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.393 --> 00:59:20.121]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.442 --> 00:59:24.185]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.746 --> 00:59:27.588]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:36.017]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.317 --> 00:59:38.620]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.261 --> 00:59:41.723]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:59:42.104 --> 00:59:47.610]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:54.693]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
[00:59:55.053 --> 00:59:59.895]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
