[00:00:20.148 --> 00:00:20.949]  Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.751]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:23.632]  I'm Darren McBreen.
[00:00:23.672 --> 00:00:25.053]  It is Thursday, December 22nd, 2016.
[00:00:25.114 --> 00:00:26.735]  Here's a quick look at what's coming up.
[00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:40.032]  Mike Dulo, lead investigator for Sheriff Arpaio's Cold Case Posse, looks at the Obama birth certificate.
[00:00:40.392 --> 00:00:44.675]  This is the video that puts to rest doubts about the birther issue.
[00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:50.298]  We document how the forensic evidence shows the birth certificate is a forgery.
[00:00:50.838 --> 00:00:55.261]  Then, it was a bad week for fake news as Huckster's hoaxes were exposed.
[00:00:55.601 --> 00:01:02.145]  An internet prankster fails to create fake news, and MTV is embarrassed to the point of removing their racist video.
[00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.827]  And, desperation and hubris.
[00:01:04.907 --> 00:01:09.350]  It's all the Democrats have left after being shown the door by the American people.
[00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.453]  It wasn't the Russians, it wasn't a majority of racist, angry, white male voters, and it wasn't fake news.
[00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:17.735]  Democrats did it to themselves.
[00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:20.659]  Now they're paralyzed by their own avarice.
[00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:25.065]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.954]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:02.247 --> 00:03:03.828]  Well, look what time it is.
[00:03:04.188 --> 00:03:06.809]  It's time for me to say, I told you so.
[00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.331]  Because Barack Hussein Obama's birth certificate is a total fraud.
[00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:17.432]  It is, without a doubt, an illegal forged document.
[00:03:17.652 --> 00:03:24.155]  And before you start calling me a birther, or a conspiracy theorist, or say that this is fake news,
[00:03:24.915 --> 00:03:25.795]  Let me prove it to you.
[00:03:26.016 --> 00:03:27.396]  All right, this will only take a few minutes.
[00:03:27.456 --> 00:03:28.937]  I say we have some fun with this.
[00:03:29.657 --> 00:03:33.099]  And I promise this is going to be very, very interesting, so check it out.
[00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:40.542]  And for those of you out there who think anyone who questions Obama's birth certificate, well, that we should be wearing tinfoil hats.
[00:03:41.022 --> 00:03:56.087]  This is your opportunity to prove us wrong here at InfoWars, make me look like a dumbass, and finally put a nail in the coffin or finally debunk this Obama birth certificate conspiracy theory once and for all.
[00:03:56.387 --> 00:03:58.248]  So, let's get started, shall we?
[00:03:58.348 --> 00:03:58.928]  First up...
[00:03:59.904 --> 00:04:06.208]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the man in charge of the investigation, steps up to the plate.
[00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:25.102]  And I tell you what, he hit a home run last week when he held a press conference where criminal investigators made a breaking announcement about the legitimacy of the birth certificate belonging to Barack Obama, the ghost president of the United States.
[00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:42.858]  Every official in Hawaii, Democrat and Republican, every news outlet that has investigated this, confirmed that yes, in fact, I was born in Hawaii, August 4th, 1961, in Kapiolani Hospital.
[00:04:43.318 --> 00:04:44.759]  Here we are, I'm going to cut this layer.
[00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:46.161]  Boom.
[00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:50.365]  And now we're going to add it to a different layer on top of that other layer.
[00:04:50.725 --> 00:04:51.566]  And now you can see
[00:04:52.898 --> 00:04:57.322]  This is a completely different layer, and there's even a missing number on this when you bring this back in.
[00:04:57.342 --> 00:05:02.206]  Yeah, so this one was here originally, but then they added these numbers it looks like.
[00:05:03.087 --> 00:05:04.228]  Watch the signature here.
[00:05:05.424 --> 00:05:07.425]  Part of the signature's there and part of it's not.
[00:05:08.025 --> 00:05:12.448]  They add the numbers 1 here and over here there's a 3 and a 1 added.
[00:05:12.468 --> 00:05:19.371]  You can just see by turning it on and off, you know, there's different letters all over this that have been added into it.
[00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:26.975]  Obama's birth certificate has been proven by two leading experts in forensic fraud documentation to be a forgery.
[00:05:27.355 --> 00:05:30.877]  Let me tell you about Reed Hayes, a man with 40 years, since 1974, 40 plus years,
[00:05:34.457 --> 00:05:50.246]  of experience in examining forensics, document, handwriting, a man who's well-respected in his expertise, a court-recognized expert, a document examiner.
[00:05:50.406 --> 00:05:55.889]  Mr. Hayes told me right off the bat, I'm an Obama supporter.
[00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.270]  I voted for him twice.
[00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:01.833]  He goes, and I will never do anything to hurt the President of the United States.
[00:06:03.055 --> 00:06:07.739]  What I had said to him was, Reed, I am not asking you to hurt the President of the United States.
[00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.403]  I'm asking you to take a look at this document and clear it and tell me there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:06:14.324 --> 00:06:15.525]  Would you at least do that?
[00:06:17.266 --> 00:06:18.127]  And he took a look at it.
[00:06:19.128 --> 00:06:21.730]  And when he called me back, he told me, Mike,
[00:06:23.146 --> 00:06:24.487]  I can't clear this.
[00:06:24.527 --> 00:06:25.907]  There's something wrong with it.
[00:06:25.987 --> 00:06:33.751]  We utilized forensic document examiners Reid Hayes and Hawaii and a company named 4LAB in Italy.
[00:06:34.711 --> 00:06:38.473]  4LABS trains law enforcement throughout Europe.
[00:06:39.413 --> 00:06:42.555]  4LABS, everybody in that building, is a PhD.
[00:06:43.315 --> 00:06:44.376]  These guys know their stuff.
[00:06:44.936 --> 00:06:47.057]  And I'm going to tell you what I respect about both of them.
[00:06:48.077 --> 00:06:48.858]  Both Reid Hayes
[00:06:50.256 --> 00:06:54.358]  And Marco at 4Labs stayed true to their discipline.
[00:06:55.138 --> 00:06:56.839]  These men could not be pushed.
[00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:01.861]  This is their findings, this is how they see it, and this is how they're calling it.
[00:07:02.101 --> 00:07:05.723]  The birth certificate on the left belongs to Barack Obama.
[00:07:06.243 --> 00:07:09.965]  The birth certificate on the right belongs to Johanna Ani.
[00:07:12.174 --> 00:07:31.226]  After five years of intense investigation, which included consultation with one of America's most respected forensic document examiners and a team of European media forensic experts, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office has reached a conclusion utilizing forensic techniques both old and new.
[00:07:32.206 --> 00:07:47.098]  It is the opinion of the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office that the birth certificate on your right, belonging to Johanna Ani, was in fact used as a source document in the digital creation of Barack Obama's long-form birth certificate.
[00:07:48.259 --> 00:08:01.330]  Nine points of forgery in words, letters, and hand-placed date stamps have been digitally copied from the Ani long-form birth certificate and pasted onto Obama's long-form birth certificate.
[00:08:02.395 --> 00:08:12.503]  That was one of the original things people noticed was the alignment was off on some of the rows and even before people were getting in this detail to the forensics, you could see it was a little off.
[00:08:12.523 --> 00:08:18.067]  You know, while we're watching this, I'm reminded of Michelle Obama attacking Trump on this very issue.
[00:08:19.388 --> 00:08:26.634]  It's going to be interesting though, you know, what sort of happens after this if they're able to get enough people to agree that, wow, you know what?
[00:08:27.489 --> 00:08:31.412]  How many more layers of evidence do we need before we start seeing something fishy here?
[00:08:31.432 --> 00:08:37.796]  I mean, it's going to just have a reverb effect throughout everything else that comes out of the White House.
[00:08:37.936 --> 00:08:43.060]  No one's going to believe, they don't even believe this whole Russian disinformation campaign going on.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:52.588]  The real fake news, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, one of the biggest offenders, they're going to spin this, Leanna.
[00:08:52.608 --> 00:08:56.331]  It's up to people listening to shut it off.
[00:08:56.711 --> 00:09:02.456]  They concluded that it is a thousand times more probable that the document is inauthentic.
[00:09:03.277 --> 00:09:07.720]  They also concluded that if they had a greater sampling, that number would be higher.
[00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:18.427]  Because they have concluded that that document, it is highly improbable, next to impossible, that you will find another document with every anomaly we just showed you.
[00:09:18.787 --> 00:09:21.228]  Read Hayes' conclusion.
[00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:31.894]  The evidence noted herein is clear and convincing proof that the Obama Certificate of Live Birth posted on whitehouse.gov on April 27, 2011,
[00:09:34.876 --> 00:09:38.658]  Is a fraudulently manufactured document.
[00:09:38.899 --> 00:09:50.025]  Five years ago, when the Tea Party, 250 of them, came to my office, said, you're the elected sheriff, will you please investigate the birth certificate?
[00:09:50.346 --> 00:09:52.887]  And I don't think I was crazy.
[00:09:53.267 --> 00:09:55.589]  I've been a federal guy for 30 years.
[00:09:55.609 --> 00:09:59.971]  I think I knew the heat I would take, but I had to do it.
[00:10:00.372 --> 00:10:00.852]  And I did.
[00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:02.650]  With Mike Zullo.
[00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:07.572]  I appointed him to do it because there was no taxpayer's money.
[00:10:07.712 --> 00:10:09.132]  A posse works for nothing.
[00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:10.993]  I knew I would get heat on that issue.
[00:10:11.893 --> 00:10:12.513]  And I did it.
[00:10:12.874 --> 00:10:15.214]  I said I could care less where he is from.
[00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:16.815]  I stick with that.
[00:10:17.615 --> 00:10:23.477]  I said we are investigating a forged, fraudulent government document.
[00:10:23.577 --> 00:10:25.037]  I said that from day one.
[00:10:25.117 --> 00:10:26.518]  I continue to say that.
[00:10:27.643 --> 00:10:34.289]  And I said from day one, show the birth certificate or a microfiche and we'll all go home.
[00:10:34.649 --> 00:10:35.790]  That's never happened.
[00:10:36.311 --> 00:10:38.793]  Mike Zulu has done a great job.
[00:10:38.873 --> 00:10:39.594]  Tenacity.
[00:10:40.174 --> 00:10:46.119]  And we got some lucky breaks to put the nail in the coffin recently.
[00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:47.921]  And that's what I went public on.
[00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:54.447]  Had nothing to do with me leaving office because I would have done the same thing if I was reelected.
[00:10:54.915 --> 00:11:04.959]  Now most of you know that the mainstream media has been very critical of anyone suggesting that Barack Obama's birth certificate might be a fraud.
[00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:07.540]  And believe me, they got the memo.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.481]  I'm talking about the people who work for the mainstream media.
[00:11:10.781 --> 00:11:14.323]  They know that Obama's birth certificate is off limits.
[00:11:14.963 --> 00:11:15.724]  You don't go there.
[00:11:16.104 --> 00:11:20.347]  Unless, of course, someone like Donald Trump shows up and starts asking questions.
[00:11:20.927 --> 00:11:30.734]  Or if Alex Jones brings it up, that's when the establishment media goes into full attack mode and they come to Obama's rescue.
[00:11:31.474 --> 00:11:43.220]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones, the conservative conspiracy theorist and operator of the website InfoWars, which seems to be a place where Trump gets a lot of his information.
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.463]  Jones can take credit for spearheading some of the most outrageous theories on the Internet.
[00:11:48.643 --> 00:11:56.167]  Jones' theories reach tens of millions each month and are now often echoed by the next president of the United States.
[00:11:56.647 --> 00:11:58.328]  Take President Obama's birth.
[00:11:58.788 --> 00:12:00.489]  Trump comes along and said,
[00:12:01.502 --> 00:12:07.968]  Now, I want you all to listen very carefully because what I'm about to say is very important and I want to be clear so there's no misunderstanding.
[00:12:19.011 --> 00:12:26.081]  We are not saying that Barack Obama was born outside of the United States and that he is not a US citizen.
[00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:32.049]  We're not even claiming that Communist Frank Marshall Davis is Barack Obama's father.
[00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:33.932]  Fact is, we just don't know.
[00:12:34.492 --> 00:12:39.616]  I personally believe Obama's father is Frank Marshall Davis, but this investigation does not prove that.
[00:12:40.076 --> 00:12:42.698]  What we do know is significant.
[00:12:43.178 --> 00:12:53.325]  Forensic evidence proves without a doubt that the official birth certificate belonging to Barack Obama, the President of the United States, is a fake.
[00:12:54.346 --> 00:13:00.630]  Mike Zullo, the Chief Investigator from Sheriff Joe Arpaio's Cold Case Posse, he joins us now.
[00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:13.117]  And Mike, Arpaio and yourself, you guys were on the Alex Jones Show over the weekend, and it was Sheriff Joe who said that you guys put the final nail in the coffin of this birther controversy, if you will.
[00:13:13.397 --> 00:13:14.077]  Do you think it is?
[00:13:14.337 --> 00:13:17.879]  I would imagine there's a lot of people out there that still refuse to believe it, am I right?
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.120]  You're right.
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.302]  There are people that, no matter what you did, are not going to believe this issue.
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:33.209]  As far as the document is concerned, we had two different forensic experts, two different disciplines, two different continents, review our information, and all came to the same conclusion.
[00:13:33.369 --> 00:13:35.010]  The document is completely fraudulent.
[00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.991]  It's inauthentic.
[00:13:36.491 --> 00:13:38.113]  It's not what it represents itself to be.
[00:13:39.264 --> 00:13:41.725]  What does this say about the mainstream news media?
[00:13:41.785 --> 00:13:46.728]  Because we've been covering this for a long time and they refuse to follow this.
[00:13:47.168 --> 00:13:52.091]  And I still, I expected at least a little more participation after this press conference.
[00:13:52.471 --> 00:13:53.992]  Why do you think they're not talking about it?
[00:13:54.673 --> 00:13:56.253]  Well, this information is devastating.
[00:13:56.874 --> 00:14:02.357]  And what you have to realize is this goes directly to document fraud and a fraudulent document being
[00:14:03.123 --> 00:14:07.787]  Well, I want to learn more about the forensic labs that tested the document.
[00:14:07.807 --> 00:14:09.668]  It was headed up by a guy that was a liberal.
[00:14:09.768 --> 00:14:11.530]  He did not want to damage Barack Obama's
[00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:53.911]  Reputation, but he can't hide from the evidence and he was he was faced with the facts I mean he had to I mean this is this is obviously a fraud and there's no denying it No, Reid Hayes a certified document examiner recognized as an expert in courtroom testimony I mean this guy has credentials longer than my arm and We used him the first time we use him the first time I think it was the first press conference We released that we used Reid Hayes media completely ignored ignored it
[00:14:54.653 --> 00:15:01.201]  When Mr. Hayes took on the assignment, he made it very clear to me he was a supporter of Barack Obama's wanting nothing to really do with this.
[00:15:02.022 --> 00:15:08.430]  And I had asked him if he would kindly take a look at it and just verify for me the document is okay and we can close this issue.
[00:15:09.198 --> 00:15:15.219]  And like a true professional, he looked at it, there was problems, and he said, I can't verify the document, it's okay, there's something wrong with it.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:26.202]  Well I hope a lot of people out there who are watching this, who have supported Obama over the years, or who have doubted that this is real, I hope they come to the realization, and you know, they gotta face the facts as well.
[00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:28.823]  And I hope they have the courage to stand up for what is real.
[00:15:30.083 --> 00:15:34.644]  And I'm also curious about, you know, the first time we saw the document, it was years ago.
[00:15:34.664 --> 00:15:45.566]  I mean, it really wasn't even that good of a forgery to begin with, because we were able to take the layers and this was like a Photoshop layer document, which just simply did not exist in the 60s, right?
[00:15:45.866 --> 00:15:46.466]  No, it didn't.
[00:15:46.626 --> 00:15:56.908]  And the problem with the layering argument was there was so many different computer explanations for things, even though we never believed that it was anything other than a forgery.
[00:15:57.452 --> 00:16:01.834]  We have to look at an investigation as not just simply making an arrest, you look at it for conviction.
[00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:06.235]  And conviction means you have to convince a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that you're correct.
[00:16:07.075 --> 00:16:13.938]  And the problem with the computer forensics and the way the document would break apart, look, it was completely suspect.
[00:16:14.438 --> 00:16:22.621]  But you could make arguments that computerized anomalies were created by algorithmic problems inside the computer systems or the scanners.
[00:16:23.121 --> 00:16:25.082]  We needed to get completely away from that.
[00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:28.370]  And that's how we got to our nine points of verified forgery.
[00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.551]  You're not going to be able to refute this document.
[00:16:31.112 --> 00:16:31.672]  It's a fraud.
[00:16:32.352 --> 00:16:35.113]  Were there forensic labs who refused to cooperate?
[00:16:35.333 --> 00:16:38.995]  That is like they don't want nothing to do with it and they said, no way we're going to investigate this?
[00:16:39.555 --> 00:16:40.056]  Yeah, like about 200.
[00:16:40.456 --> 00:16:42.096]  Right over 200.
[00:16:42.216 --> 00:16:45.578]  We got 28 responses, six of those on the phone.
[00:16:46.158 --> 00:16:47.439]  Everyone told us the same thing.
[00:16:47.479 --> 00:16:48.519]  They weren't going to touch it.
[00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:49.720]  It's too high profile.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.801]  We ended up actually having to go overseas.
[00:16:52.901 --> 00:16:54.442]  We contacted people in Germany.
[00:16:55.137 --> 00:16:58.859]  Germany was going to do it, but I would have had to rob Circle K's to pay them.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.401]  China told us no, obviously.
[00:17:02.881 --> 00:17:04.002]  And we never went to Russia.
[00:17:04.182 --> 00:17:05.403]  Russia has nothing to do with this.
[00:17:05.883 --> 00:17:07.504]  We ended up through talking to some people.
[00:17:07.544 --> 00:17:11.706]  They put us in touch with 4Lab, who is the forensic technicians that we use.
[00:17:12.186 --> 00:17:14.228]  They train law enforcement all throughout Europe.
[00:17:14.328 --> 00:17:16.769]  Their specialty is child pornography cases.
[00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:20.391]  And they did the work and they were really, really good with us.
[00:17:20.511 --> 00:17:23.793]  I mean, they painstakingly ran this thing through its paces.
[00:17:24.602 --> 00:17:27.764]  And if there was any time they thought it wasn't going to be what it was, they were going to tell me.
[00:17:28.684 --> 00:17:34.807]  Well, and I also want to point out to our audience that the birth certificate is not the only document in question.
[00:17:34.827 --> 00:17:37.488]  There's lots of mysteries surrounding Barack Obama.
[00:17:37.508 --> 00:17:41.970]  That's why I've always called him the ghost president, because we really don't know who this guy is.
[00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.311]  A lot of his college records are sealed.
[00:17:44.632 --> 00:17:46.192]  We don't have access to them.
[00:17:46.493 --> 00:17:49.814]  Or maybe you can even refer to him as the Maturian candidate.
[00:17:50.134 --> 00:17:51.475]  Mike Zullo, you got the last word.
[00:17:52.418 --> 00:17:53.438]  Well, I'm on board with that.
[00:17:53.478 --> 00:17:55.619]  I mean, the background, it doesn't work.
[00:17:56.039 --> 00:17:57.459]  The background has dead ends to it.
[00:17:57.499 --> 00:17:58.379]  You don't know anything.
[00:17:58.459 --> 00:18:00.519]  After eight years, we still don't really know anything.
[00:18:00.919 --> 00:18:01.840]  Nobody knows who he is.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.761]  And we don't have a document that really is verifying his birth anywhere in the United States at this point.
[00:18:08.141 --> 00:18:09.341]  That's a fraudulent document.
[00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:10.241]  Nobody knows the truth.
[00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:11.121]  All right.
[00:18:11.161 --> 00:18:12.001]  Where do we go from here?
[00:18:12.021 --> 00:18:15.922]  I understand there's legislation that you're trying to put in place to stop this from happening again.
[00:18:16.642 --> 00:18:16.982]  We do.
[00:18:17.022 --> 00:18:20.083]  We want to push for legislation called the Presidential Transparency Act.
[00:18:20.223 --> 00:18:22.303]  We want it that if the Secretary of State
[00:18:22.833 --> 00:18:27.736]  As an issue like this, Secretary of States across the country don't have any way to investigate something like this.
[00:18:28.257 --> 00:18:40.244]  We want statutory provisions where a Secretary of State of any state on cause could petition the FBI to do a proper background vetting investigation of anyone wanting to be President or Vice President.
[00:18:40.765 --> 00:18:42.566]  We think it's very fair, it's very easy.
[00:18:42.966 --> 00:18:47.269]  The janitor in the White House goes through more vetting than the President of the United States.
[00:18:47.887 --> 00:18:48.668]  Yeah, I hear you.
[00:18:48.788 --> 00:18:50.449]  Well, I tell you what, we're out of time.
[00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:51.690]  Thanks for your courage.
[00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.551]  We really appreciate what you've done.
[00:18:54.151 --> 00:18:56.233]  And, you know, give our best regards to Arpaio.
[00:18:56.453 --> 00:18:59.195]  You guys have a Merry Christmas and we'll see you back sometime next year.
[00:19:01.977 --> 00:19:16.407]  Three years ago, the Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act repealed the law that had been on the books for decades, barring the CIA and other agencies from engaging in domestic propaganda and disinformation.
[00:19:17.734 --> 00:19:36.358]  Over the weekend, they passed the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act that funds 160 plus million dollars to this new organization that will, quote, discover and counter with its own disinformation, alternative media that they dub fake news.
[00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:52.010]  At the very same time, we see mainstream media claiming that Trump, myself, Tucker Carlson, you name it, are Russian agents, and that the American people really wanted Hillary Clinton, but the Russians somehow hacked in, and that's why Trump won.
[00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:56.173]  Yes, we've gotten Trump elected, but they're openly trying to overthrow that.
[00:19:57.034 --> 00:20:00.379]  Now more than ever, InfoWars needs your prayers and your support.
[00:20:00.439 --> 00:20:06.106]  And I need you to take the articles and the videos that are on the site and realize you're the reason we're having such an effect.

[00:20:13.869 --> 00:20:22.471]  As we approach Christmas, and I'm supposed to say that word now, our country's under such incredible thought police tyranny, it's important to be thankful.
[00:20:22.612 --> 00:20:34.215]  And I am extremely thankful to all of you that have prayed for us, that have spread the word about the broadcast, that have supported us, that have defended us, and that have financially supported us.

[00:23:16.823 --> 00:23:25.747]  Well, I think, you know, let's get a little update on this hashtag boycott Delta story that was one of the top trending things all day yesterday, talking about fake news.
[00:23:26.407 --> 00:23:32.909]  So here is a serial YouTube prankster says that he was kicked off a plane off a Delta flight for speaking Arabic.
[00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:34.330]  They, you know, too loudly.
[00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:39.552]  Now we have passengers that were seated on the plane disputing his account.
[00:23:40.332 --> 00:23:46.035]  But the interesting thing is that when we have these kind of race crime hoaxes,
[00:23:46.795 --> 00:23:47.396]  It doesn't matter.
[00:23:47.576 --> 00:23:49.937]  The fake news just takes it and runs with it.
[00:23:49.957 --> 00:23:51.939]  And they're like, oh man, was kicked off of a flight.
[00:23:52.299 --> 00:23:57.003]  You know, and of course that's going to set Delta stocks so, um, plummeting, plummeting.
[00:23:57.023 --> 00:23:57.603]  Yeah.
[00:23:57.963 --> 00:24:00.345]  You know, and so this is, it's like, there's no accountability here.
[00:24:00.385 --> 00:24:02.026]  They're like, Ooh, a race crime.
[00:24:02.066 --> 00:24:03.367]  Let's go ahead and just go with it.
[00:24:03.507 --> 00:24:10.693]  And let's not forget about all the social justice warriors on social media that immediately bought this hook, line and sinker and tweeted about it all day.
[00:24:10.993 --> 00:24:18.501]  You know what, these fake anti-Muslim racial profiling incidents, they only give credence to the fact, because they're normally targeted at Trump supporters, let's be honest.
[00:24:18.581 --> 00:24:20.663]  You know, it's normally that big bad Trump supporter.
[00:24:21.103 --> 00:24:23.586]  Like the case in Mississippi, the churchgoer, do you remember this?
[00:24:23.626 --> 00:24:25.908]  It was right a week before the election took place.
[00:24:26.368 --> 00:24:29.972]  Somebody wrote, vote Trump on the side of a Mississippi church, then burned it to the ground.
[00:24:30.372 --> 00:24:33.776]  They were trying to claim the media ran with this for about four days straight.
[00:24:34.116 --> 00:24:41.223]  Turns out it was an actual parishioner, 45-year-old Andrew McClinton, burned down his own church and then tried to blame it on Trump supporters.
[00:24:41.243 --> 00:24:42.524]  We saw the same thing with the burqa.
[00:24:43.024 --> 00:24:44.385]  The lady's name is escaping me.
[00:24:44.486 --> 00:24:48.329]  Accused white male of ripping off her burqa, who was also a Trump supporter.
[00:24:48.349 --> 00:24:49.090]  Turned out to be fake.
[00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:53.854]  This Adam Salah story, you know, you think they know by now.
[00:24:53.874 --> 00:24:54.415]  Right.
[00:24:56.096 --> 00:24:59.138]  Okay, then just to get another one, another instance.
[00:24:59.198 --> 00:25:00.239]  Let's let everything come in.
[00:25:00.279 --> 00:25:03.622]  Let's see what the other passengers on the plane have to say about the story.
[00:25:03.642 --> 00:25:04.522]  Do they agree as well?
[00:25:04.542 --> 00:25:05.563]  And let's not just take this.
[00:25:05.983 --> 00:25:14.310]  And here it's like highly documented that he's a known YouTube prankster that sets up, oh, I'm going to dress in Muslim garb and see if I get
[00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:21.933]  You know, traditional Muslim garb and see if I get accosted or kicked off a plane or I'm going to count down from 10 in Arabic and see if I can terrorize everyone.
[00:25:22.294 --> 00:25:29.837]  This is the kind of stuff that when people do actually suffer from a hate crime, we don't believe them because it's like the boy who cried wolf too many times.
[00:25:30.337 --> 00:25:33.079]  And people are saying, well, you know, it's kicked off a flight.
[00:25:33.179 --> 00:25:34.139]  It happens all the time.
[00:25:34.739 --> 00:25:39.622]  And the point is, if you're on a flight and you're causing a disturbance, you're going to get kicked off.
[00:25:39.962 --> 00:25:41.743]  Case in point, there were two
[00:25:42.563 --> 00:25:47.767]  Gay men, gay white males that were harassing Ivanka Trump on a JetBlue flight.
[00:25:48.248 --> 00:25:51.230]  And they got kicked off because they were coming harassing her.
[00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.331]  Why are you on this flight?
[00:25:52.371 --> 00:25:53.672]  You should be on a private jet.
[00:25:53.732 --> 00:25:54.813]  She flew coach by the way.
[00:25:54.833 --> 00:25:55.094]  Yeah.
[00:25:55.114 --> 00:25:56.094]  If anybody cares.
[00:25:56.175 --> 00:26:03.681]  She flew coach with her kids on a JetBlue and they're yelling at her saying how her dad is destroying the country and how he's this elitist scum.
[00:26:04.181 --> 00:26:06.183]  But then they're yelling at her for taking a coach JetBlue.
[00:26:06.203 --> 00:26:19.210]  I mean, this might be an extreme analogy here, but like, if I go out and I am wearing a KKK outfit and I'm causing trouble in an event or on a plane and I get beat up or arrested or whatever, well that's what I deserve, okay?
[00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:23.312]  And if I come out and I'm like, no, you're racist against the white man, how dare you?
[00:26:23.692 --> 00:26:24.253]  No, no, no, no.
[00:26:24.433 --> 00:26:27.316]  The KKK has a history of racial violence.
[00:26:27.496 --> 00:26:28.938]  I deserve everything I get.
[00:26:29.258 --> 00:26:36.626]  We live in a culture now where radical Islam ideology is now promoting violence and inflicting violence on innocent people.
[00:26:36.666 --> 00:26:41.171]  So yeah, you go on the plane, you try to make your little jokes, there's going to be a response.
[00:26:41.271 --> 00:26:41.431]  Right.
[00:26:41.571 --> 00:26:46.993]  Speaking of occult violence, ISIS puts churches in all 50 states in this country on a hit list.
[00:26:47.293 --> 00:26:55.297]  They're encouraging these lone wolf attacks to go into churches, hotels, coffee shops, and do as much damage as you can, kill as many people as you can.
[00:26:55.717 --> 00:27:02.400]  But, you know, other than Vocative and a couple of other news sites, this is not on mainstream media for some reason.
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.281]  You know, the last time they did this, they put 8,000 police officers.
[00:27:05.301 --> 00:27:05.941]  For some reason, yeah.
[00:27:06.321 --> 00:27:07.382]  Right, on a list.
[00:27:07.602 --> 00:27:13.446]  And, you know, we've got this ridiculous sense of multi- we have to be multicultural, we have to be politically correct.
[00:27:13.786 --> 00:27:17.769]  Meanwhile, we've got a full-on list with addresses on it.
[00:27:17.869 --> 00:27:20.591]  If you're celebrating Christmas, hey, you're just a target.
[00:27:20.611 --> 00:27:22.032]  I'm sorry, you're a target.
[00:27:22.192 --> 00:27:30.878]  How funny would it be if Adam Saleh went to go do a viral video outside of these churches and started pretending that he was a terrorist and see what the reaction would be.
[00:27:30.898 --> 00:27:31.158]  Right.
[00:27:31.338 --> 00:27:36.001]  And prove that everyone's racist because they were afraid of him counting down in Arabic.
[00:27:36.661 --> 00:27:37.362]  It's ridiculous.
[00:28:06.361 --> 00:28:18.812]  Well racial tensions are high and we're hearing these stories coming out and it's almost as if it's meant to continue having the racial tension so that we'll lead up to the election with all the protests.
[00:28:19.032 --> 00:28:28.260]  But let's recall, and I tweeted this out earlier today, remember Hitler burned the Reichstag as a false flag to start war.
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:39.090]  And we just covered a few stories talking about hoaxes, and you can see the tweet there from Brittany Pettibone highlighting, and there's been a bunch of tweets like this, highlighting all the headlines.
[00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:40.951]  We just touched on some of them.
[00:28:41.332 --> 00:28:43.994]  Islamic hoax says Trump supporters beat her.
[00:28:44.034 --> 00:28:45.876]  That turned out to be false.
[00:28:46.336 --> 00:28:47.637]  Hoax this, hoax here, hoax here.
[00:28:47.918 --> 00:28:49.739]  So what is this?
[00:28:49.779 --> 00:28:50.280]  What's going on?
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.881]  It's a false flag.
[00:28:52.702 --> 00:28:58.968]  You blame your enemy in order to perpetuate the war or the tension, whatever it is.
[00:28:59.248 --> 00:28:59.789]  Hitler did it.
[00:29:00.009 --> 00:29:00.749]  And how funny is that?
[00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:02.391]  They say that Trump supporters are Hitler.
[00:29:02.751 --> 00:29:05.814]  Here we have all the anti-Trumpers actually doing what Hitler did.
[00:29:06.334 --> 00:29:12.280]  Not only that, the mainstream media, and this is Leanne's article, but I have to highlight in case we forget to do it, Chris Hayes.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.842]  The mainstream media, they are perpetuators of this garbage.
[00:29:15.862 --> 00:29:22.665]  They understand that if they just say it again and again and again, some unsuspecting people who just read headlines might absorb it.
[00:29:22.745 --> 00:29:34.491]  And this Chris Hayes character, this sustained effort to delegitimize Trump, quote, no matter how deranged is the path back to power for Democrats, they are willing to do anything that they possibly can.
[00:29:34.511 --> 00:29:36.012]  Fake news, disinfo.
[00:29:36.872 --> 00:29:37.572]  Whatever they have to do.
[00:29:37.592 --> 00:29:42.396]  They don't care if they have to lie to you, if they have to, you know, make up crap as they go along.
[00:29:42.496 --> 00:29:48.700]  With this Adam Saleh story, they took this and ran with it, you know, it was on every single hour of CNN, etc.
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.342]  And so then the retraction comes too late.
[00:29:52.382 --> 00:29:53.443]  It's just like if you issue a retraction.
[00:29:53.463 --> 00:29:54.424]  The damage is done.
[00:29:54.744 --> 00:29:55.805]  People already took the story.
[00:29:55.845 --> 00:29:56.425]  They believe it.
[00:29:56.605 --> 00:30:00.928]  People are fighting about it on Twitter, you know, and they've already committed to it being real.
[00:30:01.268 --> 00:30:03.890]  They're not okay with it being a hoax at this point.
[00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:06.712]  So they've already like committed to being duped by the story.
[00:30:07.473 --> 00:30:23.996]  And then there's also a story that came out this week about the families of the Orlando shooting victims families are suing now Facebook, Twitter and Google saying that they they're doing everything they can to of course stop anyone from criticizing Islam but
[00:30:24.396 --> 00:30:39.575]  But when ISIS and other jihadi groups are actually using their platforms to commit these atrocities or to gain supporters, they're not doing their job in shutting this down and so they're actually now suing these people saying that they are providing material support.
[00:30:39.795 --> 00:30:47.878]  Well, and victims of the Nice attack as well have taken a lawsuit against these same social media platforms.
[00:30:47.938 --> 00:30:54.181]  And just, you know, off topic, but same topic, we still don't know where the wife of Omar Mateen is.
[00:30:54.241 --> 00:30:55.101]  You know she's still gone?
[00:30:55.661 --> 00:30:56.102]  M.I.A.
[00:30:56.422 --> 00:30:57.662]  They had her, now she's gone.
[00:30:57.802 --> 00:30:59.843]  Omar Mateen gets to sit behind Hillary Clinton at rallies.
[00:30:59.963 --> 00:31:00.403]  Right.
[00:31:00.443 --> 00:31:01.244]  But moving on...
[00:31:02.785 --> 00:31:03.005]  Right.
[00:31:03.085 --> 00:31:03.907]  Moving on though.
[00:31:04.187 --> 00:31:08.934]  So you've got all of these attacks and then you've got the MTV video which they had to pull down.
[00:31:08.954 --> 00:31:09.916]  It was so terrible.
[00:31:09.936 --> 00:31:11.859]  Because it was so bad and it got totally bad.
[00:31:12.159 --> 00:31:13.140]  You know, and that's the amazing thing.
[00:31:13.721 --> 00:31:14.943]  None of this I think is sticking.
[00:31:15.404 --> 00:31:17.848]  I really think that all of these efforts are failing, guys.
[00:31:18.331 --> 00:31:24.874]  They're miserable failures, but going back to Leanne's story about these social media giants being complicit, they are civilly liable.
[00:31:24.914 --> 00:31:30.037]  They allow groups like ISIS to exchange information, to raise money in some cases.
[00:31:30.077 --> 00:31:38.101]  I've seen groups that allow, you know, Sareed Farooq, his wife, was complaining for weeks and weeks on end about how, you know, she was persecuted.
[00:31:38.121 --> 00:31:46.845]  They're allowing people to sync up and become radicalized, and yet, if you try to promote, I dare you, if you're on social media right now, post something that's true,
[00:31:47.245 --> 00:31:52.249]  That you know that's true and tag a few people in it and see how quickly that gets shut down and censored.
[00:31:52.309 --> 00:31:53.570]  Violates the community guidelines.
[00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:57.053]  But if you're promoting for ISIS, I mean, let's say you put a church address up.
[00:31:57.093 --> 00:31:57.734]  Well, you know what?
[00:31:57.794 --> 00:31:59.475]  That's right at the, okay.
[00:31:59.535 --> 00:32:00.816]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:32:00.876 --> 00:32:01.817]  Put out your kill list.
[00:32:01.857 --> 00:32:02.418]  That's fine.
[00:32:02.458 --> 00:32:04.159]  That can be allowed to circulate on the internet.
[00:32:04.199 --> 00:32:10.945]  Watson did a story about how they were actually, these jihadist groups were selling weapons via Facebook.
[00:32:11.125 --> 00:32:11.225]  Yep.
[00:32:11.865 --> 00:32:17.586]  Military-grade weapons on Facebook and it was up well after his report went out, but they didn't shut it down.
[00:32:18.146 --> 00:32:27.768]  So they're recruiting on Facebook, they're selling weapons on Facebook, but if you're supporting Trump on Facebook or speaking bad about Obama, you know, you're liable to get censored.
[00:32:27.788 --> 00:32:28.388]  That's offensive.
[00:32:29.129 --> 00:32:30.249]  I'm triggered.
[00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:35.530]  Actually, I was blocked on Twitter for a moment because I put out a picture
[00:32:36.707 --> 00:32:38.788]  Little humor for you here as we close the segment.
[00:32:38.868 --> 00:32:47.710]  It was a picture of an elephant's butt, and I tagged it leaked Barack Obama selfie, and I was blocked on Twitter and shut down for about an hour after that.
[00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.610]  So thank you ladies for joining us.
[00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:50.570]  Merry Christmas!
[00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:51.591]  Merry Christmas to you.
[00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:55.112]  The hoaxes in the mainstream media are failing thanks to you, our listeners.
[00:32:55.172 --> 00:32:56.472]  Go into InfoWars.com.
[00:33:02.486 --> 00:33:07.268]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[00:33:07.428 --> 00:33:14.471]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:33:14.731 --> 00:33:23.215]  I started to exercise really hard again, and I started to try to eat healthy, started taking third-party supplements, started seeing some more gains.
[00:33:23.795 --> 00:33:24.015]  I think?
[00:33:42.092 --> 00:33:45.435]  I was in the best shape of my life since I'd been in really good shape in my 20s.
[00:33:45.455 --> 00:33:46.536]  But the election heated up.
[00:33:46.576 --> 00:33:48.959]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[00:33:49.079 --> 00:33:58.348]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[00:33:58.548 --> 00:33:59.509]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[00:33:59.689 --> 00:34:03.372]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put Lazy Susan back on the table.
[00:34:04.173 --> 00:34:06.295]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again.
[00:34:07.015 --> 00:34:10.238]  And I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[00:34:10.278 --> 00:34:11.579]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:15.281]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:34:15.482 --> 00:34:16.402]  It's December 5th, 2016.
[00:34:16.522 --> 00:34:20.105]  We're only like 25 days from 2017.
[00:34:20.485 --> 00:34:30.553]  And I want to invite all of the info workers of every race, color, and creed that bleed red blood and love liberty, justice, and truth to make our bodies great again.
[00:34:33.564 --> 00:34:38.587]  One of the most common questions I get is, you've changed the whole radio TV model.
[00:34:39.348 --> 00:34:40.088]  How did you do it?
[00:34:40.148 --> 00:34:43.030]  Did an ad agency teach you that or what book did you read?
[00:34:43.351 --> 00:34:44.912]  And the answer is, it was trial and error.
[00:34:45.172 --> 00:34:50.475]  I promote products that I personally use, like the Nutraceuticals and Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:50.956 --> 00:34:52.777]  And it's the same thing for this promotion.
[00:34:53.277 --> 00:34:54.598]  I didn't get this from an ad agency.
[00:34:54.658 --> 00:34:55.859]  I didn't just think this up.
[00:34:56.339 --> 00:35:03.184]  I was sitting there, I'd gained probably 10, 15 pounds because I've gotten out of the habit of taking the supplements in the last few months with the election.
[00:35:03.964 --> 00:35:14.030]  And I was thinking, wow, I need to religiously take these, because I'm promoting these things, it's making me healthier, and if I'm not taking them, you know, I'm fatter, plus people aren't going to buy the product.
[00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.672]  So that's where the promotion comes from, is purely from reality.
[00:35:18.012 --> 00:35:24.816]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table, I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[00:35:24.856 --> 00:35:31.640]  I've lost five pounds religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:32.561]  It's amazing.
[00:35:32.861 --> 00:35:35.245]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[00:35:35.505 --> 00:35:38.229]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:35:38.429 --> 00:35:40.992]  And to be clear, I'm exercising the same amount.
[00:35:41.693 --> 00:35:45.599]  It's the holidays, so I'm eating pumpkin pie, pecan pie.
[00:35:45.799 --> 00:35:47.000]  I ate a candy bar last night.
[00:35:48.456 --> 00:35:51.598]  I mean, quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[00:35:52.018 --> 00:35:53.299]  So I'm eating worse.
[00:35:53.919 --> 00:36:01.283]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost 5 pounds.
[00:36:01.443 --> 00:36:01.983]  It's incredible.
[00:36:02.984 --> 00:36:04.905]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[00:36:05.145 --> 00:36:06.406]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[00:36:06.506 --> 00:36:08.927]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[00:36:09.527 --> 00:36:10.408]  This is an experiment.
[00:36:10.528 --> 00:36:11.268]  Everybody's watching.
[00:36:11.529 --> 00:36:12.349]  We'll see what happens.
[00:36:12.789 --> 00:36:13.930]  This is Part 2.
[00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:15.571]  Next week, Part 3.
[00:36:16.451 --> 00:36:17.052]  That's a good point.
[00:36:17.892 --> 00:36:26.998]  We just cut there and Rob Deuce said, hey Alex, I know you don't follow script, but you might want to add to people, we're running some of the biggest specials of the year until December 17th.
[00:36:27.279 --> 00:36:33.003]  That's the last day that you can get your order in and have guaranteed shipping anywhere in the United States.
[00:36:33.183 --> 00:36:34.924]  And we have some of the biggest specials of the year.
[00:36:34.944 --> 00:36:37.486]  50% off many of the nutraceuticals.
[00:36:37.806 --> 00:36:38.667]  The lowest discount is 25%.
[00:36:38.707 --> 00:36:38.847]  30% off X2.
[00:36:41.889 --> 00:36:46.991]  Huge discounts and free shipping store wide on every product, thousands of items.
[00:36:47.411 --> 00:36:51.792]  And on top of that, if you sign up for auto ship, an additional 10% off.
[00:36:51.832 --> 00:36:56.774]  And I'm going to do one more bad thing because I'm politically correct, or I guess I'm politically incorrect.
[00:36:57.234 --> 00:36:59.254]  And that's a Merry Christmas to everybody.
[00:36:59.594 --> 00:37:00.755]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:37:00.835 --> 00:37:01.375]  You're awesome.
[00:37:15.049 --> 00:37:17.290]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.871]  You're a white male!
[00:37:19.951 --> 00:37:24.393]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:37:25.233 --> 00:37:26.393]  Move, bitch!
[00:37:26.453 --> 00:37:27.334]  Get out the way!
[00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:35.354]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[00:37:35.474 --> 00:37:39.597]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:37:39.737 --> 00:37:43.280]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.641]  I will not let you down.
[00:37:44.721 --> 00:37:47.343]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:37:47.463 --> 00:37:49.504]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:37:49.544 --> 00:37:51.646]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:37:51.726 --> 00:37:57.090]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:59.435]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:37:59.916 --> 00:38:01.158]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:38:16.843 --> 00:38:20.507]  Tonight I believe that the Democrats will come out in a stronger position.
[00:38:21.147 --> 00:38:24.951]  We will of course retain the White House with the election of Hillary Clinton.
[00:38:25.572 --> 00:38:28.234]  I believe we will gain the United States Senate.
[00:38:28.254 --> 00:38:34.741]  It will be close, but we will gain the United States Senate and we will pick up many seats in the House of Representatives.
[00:38:35.181 --> 00:38:47.636]  I believe that Hillary Clinton is one of the best prepared people in our history to enter the Oval Office with her vision, her knowledge, her experience, her strategic thinking, her connection to the American people.
[00:38:47.696 --> 00:38:50.019]  And I think she has made that case.
[00:38:50.259 --> 00:38:54.985]  You could put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.
[00:38:57.136 --> 00:38:58.677]  Desperation and hubris.
[00:38:58.857 --> 00:39:03.381]  It's all the Democratic Party has left after being shown the door by the American people.
[00:39:03.501 --> 00:39:08.925]  Not the Russians, not a majority of racist angry white male voters, and not fake news.
[00:39:09.105 --> 00:39:22.735]  President Bill Clinton quoted in an op-ed in the Bergen-Boundridge record saying this, that a weekly newspaper in New York, about Donald Trump by the way, one thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.
[00:39:22.955 --> 00:39:28.180]  We know that 53% of white female voters voted for Trump.
[00:39:28.661 --> 00:39:32.124]  We know that the black community didn't come out for Hillary.
[00:39:32.404 --> 00:39:35.588]  We know that Hispanics actually came out for Donald Trump.
[00:39:35.688 --> 00:39:38.190]  And we know that white men came out for Donald Trump.
[00:39:38.871 --> 00:39:40.713]  What do you tell Democrats who want a new direction?
[00:39:42.535 --> 00:39:43.836]  What are you going to do differently?
[00:39:44.056 --> 00:39:45.996]  Well, I don't think that people want a new direction.
[00:39:46.237 --> 00:39:52.559]  What we want is a better connection of our message to working families in our country.
[00:39:52.919 --> 00:39:57.621]  And that, clearly, in the election, showed that that message wasn't coming through.
[00:40:00.527 --> 00:40:02.229]  This is my America!
[00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:24.111]  Nate Silver believes, I happen to believe this, that that letter most likely made the difference in the outcome.
[00:40:24.271 --> 00:40:32.255]  The Democrats did this to themselves with the sycophantic assistance of the media, saddled with firm directives.
[00:40:32.615 --> 00:40:33.356]  Thanks for watching!
[00:40:52.088 --> 00:40:54.589]  On the morning of October 31st, the U.S.
[00:40:54.669 --> 00:40:59.491]  transmitted a message directly to the Kremlin, warning the Russians that the U.S.
[00:40:59.531 --> 00:41:03.712]  would consider any interference on Election Day a grave matter.
[00:41:03.972 --> 00:41:05.273]  The method of communication?
[00:41:05.653 --> 00:41:07.654]  The so-called red phone system.
[00:41:07.894 --> 00:41:09.014]  According to a senior U.S.
[00:41:09.054 --> 00:41:17.117]  official, part of the message reads, international law, including the law for armed conflict, applies to actions in cyberspace.
[00:41:17.537 --> 00:41:19.778]  We will hold Russia to those standards.
[00:41:19.858 --> 00:41:23.901]  National security and public safety are the ultimate policy objectives.
[00:41:24.181 --> 00:41:28.904]  Director Brennan said ISIS has an external agenda they are determined to carry out.
[00:41:28.964 --> 00:41:37.931]  Another administration official said I wouldn't put it past ISIS to infiltrate operatives among refugees, so that's a huge concern of ours.
[00:41:38.231 --> 00:41:41.714]  Those are not the words of some GOP presidential hopeful.
[00:41:42.254 --> 00:41:44.916]  Those are the words of our very own intelligence officials.
[00:41:47.064 --> 00:41:56.186]  Donald Trump won 3,084 of the United States' 3,141 counties or county equivalents in the American heartland.
[00:41:56.386 --> 00:41:58.927]  For eight long years, Washington, D.C.
[00:41:58.967 --> 00:42:07.769]  had disconnected itself from this massive base, and now it is the Democrats that are paralyzed by their own reckless avarice.
[00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:11.731]  See, now we're feeling what not having hope feels like.
[00:42:12.411 --> 00:42:18.134]  It's like the toddler that bumps his head on the table, and they look up at you to figure out whether it hurts.
[00:42:18.214 --> 00:42:20.356]  And if you're like, oh my god, they're crying.
[00:42:20.476 --> 00:42:22.317]  But if you're like, you know what, babe, it's okay.
[00:42:22.517 --> 00:42:23.057]  It's okay.
[00:42:23.337 --> 00:42:29.681]  Barack has been that for the nation in ways that people will come to appreciate.
[00:42:29.701 --> 00:42:31.261]  I mean, Russia has been hacking.
[00:42:31.782 --> 00:42:33.503]  Let's not talk on top of each other, Christine.
[00:42:33.523 --> 00:42:34.023]  Christine!
[00:42:34.063 --> 00:42:34.343]  Christine!
[00:42:38.966 --> 00:42:45.670]  I'm asking you not to talk on top of me when I'm talking and I won't do that to you so that our audience can actually get something out of this interview.
[00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:51.293]  But just the way the voters couldn't get anything and they ended up voting against you, that's what you're doing.
[00:42:51.313 --> 00:42:53.034]  You're basically blowing off the audience.
[00:43:11.639 --> 00:43:14.361]  National debt is at 19 trillion and rising.
[00:43:15.181 --> 00:43:18.443]  Our citizens are ill-informed and our government is incompetent.
[00:43:18.944 --> 00:43:20.004]  Our buildings are crumbling.
[00:43:20.325 --> 00:43:23.647]  Our deficit is almost over half a trillion dollars.
[00:43:24.147 --> 00:43:24.587]  The U.S.
[00:43:24.667 --> 00:43:25.728]  is a slave to debt.
[00:43:27.185 --> 00:43:28.146]  And why is this?
[00:43:28.166 --> 00:43:34.232]  It's largely due to frivolous and not needed purchases made by our federal government.
[00:43:34.512 --> 00:43:41.419]  These expenditures range from so-called micro-purchases of $3,000 and below, thousands of them,
[00:43:43.933 --> 00:43:46.374]  Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline
[00:44:07.212 --> 00:44:07.512]  Really?
[00:44:07.993 --> 00:44:16.358]  We owe over 19 trillion dollars in debt and continue to waste billions and even trillions on failed projects which have been proven not to work.
[00:44:16.479 --> 00:44:21.242]  We lost nearly 1 million dollars to a government-funded study of romance novels.
[00:44:21.582 --> 00:44:29.724]  Spent $65 million on tourism ads and wasted just over a trillion again on that failed aircraft program, the F-35.
[00:44:29.904 --> 00:44:33.385]  As well as a half million dollar study of medieval smells.
[00:44:33.705 --> 00:44:35.085]  Cannot make this stuff up, people.
[00:44:35.185 --> 00:44:36.526]  You do have to give them some credit, though.
[00:44:37.086 --> 00:44:41.447]  The government does find the stupidest and most outrageous ways to waste your taxpayer money.
[00:44:50.327 --> 00:44:54.249]  Another drain on your money is something they like to call a micro-purchase.
[00:44:54.669 --> 00:45:00.512]  We also waste over $20 billion on $3,000 and below micro-purchases.
[00:45:01.313 --> 00:45:06.916]  Little charge is paid for by government-issued credit cards, which most government employees have access to.
[00:45:07.916 --> 00:45:17.883]  Some notable purchases include billions of dollars spent on Starbucks, strip clubs, and thousands more frivolous purchases made by hapless federal workers.
[00:45:17.903 --> 00:45:23.166]  We wanted to know how much taxpayer money the government spends on these mysterious micro-purchases.
[00:45:23.847 --> 00:45:24.728]  So we found out.
[00:45:25.148 --> 00:45:26.349]  Our review found about $20 billion.
[00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:29.831]  In just about the course of a year.
[00:45:30.231 --> 00:45:38.136]  We asked all of these other major federal agencies based here in DC for their micro-purchase shopping lists, and all refused.
[00:45:38.417 --> 00:45:43.640]  We're spending public money, we're spending other people's money, taxpayer dollars, and we ought to account for it.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.242]  Brian Miller, former Inspector General for the U.S.
[00:45:46.262 --> 00:45:53.348]  General Services Administration, says those government credit cards and micro-purchases are supposed to be used for emergencies, for the unforeseen.
[00:45:53.528 --> 00:45:55.509]  And he says they've been abused in the past.
[00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:58.672]  Our review found cards used for purchases of clothes at J.C.
[00:45:58.752 --> 00:46:08.480]  Penney, by a cardholder at the Labor Department, for gym memberships, bought with a taxpayer-funded credit cardholder at the EPA, and at the General Services Administration, Miller said.
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:15.402]  We've had a case where a high-ranking official used the purchase card to purchase hotel rooms and spas.
[00:46:16.183 --> 00:46:31.728]  Instead of wasting $3 million to study shrimps running on treadmills, we could be spending that money in directing our tax dollars to infrastructure, energy independence, the border, and so many other notable and good causes that we don't simply have enough funding for today.
[00:46:32.088 --> 00:46:37.850]  It's vital that we change our debtor nation spending and mindset so that we can still have a country for our children.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.050]  I'm Rex Jones reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:47:03.024 --> 00:47:11.171]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:20.958]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.379 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.302 --> 00:47:28.304]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.324 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.

[00:48:59.632 --> 00:49:02.294]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:08.459 --> 00:49:17.172]  Well ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump raised awareness to the issue of illegal immigration or non-citizens receiving benefits in this country.
[00:49:17.452 --> 00:49:24.162]  Obviously the wall was a big talking point during the Trump campaign, but he also made a big statement when he said that he would cut
[00:49:24.622 --> 00:49:36.974]  Federal funding to sanctuary cities, but it looks like we may be facing a battle as far as getting that done or stopping sanctuary cities from existing in the sense that they do.
[00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:41.418]  I'm now joined in studio by Leanne McAdoo and Maggie Howell to talk about this.
[00:49:41.878 --> 00:49:44.040]  So what's happening here ladies is
[00:49:44.861 --> 00:50:01.254]  Local governments are trying to basically find a loophole to Donald Trump cutting federal funding to sanctuary cities, and what they're now doing is they're using local tax money, state tax money, to try to keep this funding going and taking it a step further.
[00:50:01.615 --> 00:50:07.399]  They now want to pay for legal representation for these non-citizens that face deportation.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:08.981]  Leanne, what are your thoughts on this?
[00:50:09.465 --> 00:50:14.730]  Well, I think, you know, first, everyone needs to just kind of look at how they're framing these arguments, okay?
[00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:28.702]  So, a lot of these mayors that are pledging to protect immigrants, if you look at all the fake news that's up there, the LA Times, the Chicago Sun-Times, they're saying these funds are being created to assist immigrants.
[00:50:29.463 --> 00:50:33.888]  Okay, if you're here legally, you do not have to fear deportation.
[00:50:33.908 --> 00:50:38.994]  The issue is people who are here illegally or criminals who are facing this deportation.
[00:50:39.355 --> 00:50:49.246]  So they're already framing this to kind of rile up the people who are afraid that they're going to be deported or there's all this rhetoric here in Austin specifically.
[00:50:49.847 --> 00:50:54.191]  We had the mayor, they just held in November, people that were there concerned for their safety.
[00:50:54.391 --> 00:50:57.934]  So it was, you know, everyone's concerned for their safety, this rhetoric, are they going to deport us?
[00:50:58.374 --> 00:51:01.137]  You know, we do have a lot of immigrants here in Austin, Texas.
[00:51:01.797 --> 00:51:09.344]  And it's, I think that there's not a really clear message about who specifically is kind of targeted here.
[00:51:09.864 --> 00:51:12.566]  Well, and you talk about safety concerns.
[00:51:12.766 --> 00:51:21.693]  The people who want to stop funding these sanctuary cities and protect the border, that's the safety concern because we see the refugees or immigrants in the clash of civilization leading to violence.
[00:51:21.713 --> 00:51:22.494]  We've seen that in Europe.
[00:51:22.874 --> 00:51:23.475]  Maggie, what do you think?
[00:51:23.897 --> 00:51:28.641]  Look, we've got these mayors, these runaway mayors like Rahm Emanuel, who is basically a mafioso boss.
[00:51:28.681 --> 00:51:29.581]  He's like a godfather.
[00:51:29.641 --> 00:51:34.485]  He thinks that he can control the presidential directive when it comes to immigration.
[00:51:34.505 --> 00:51:38.708]  There was a stand-down that happened and he basically said, Chicago's going to be a sanctuary city.
[00:51:38.728 --> 00:51:39.769]  We're not letting them deport
[00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:41.010]  Well guess what?
[00:51:41.351 --> 00:51:50.220]  We have some pretty violent offenders in this country that rape, that murder, that get behind the wheel of a car and hit and kill law-abiding citizens each and every day.
[00:51:50.241 --> 00:51:55.426]  7,800 is the official number of American citizens every year that are either
[00:51:56.067 --> 00:52:02.490]  He was fatally hurt or, you know, maimed because of an illegal immigrant action and it's time to stop it.
[00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:03.851]  It's time to restore law and order.
[00:52:03.931 --> 00:52:07.173]  We have people like Rahm Emanuel who are saying no.
[00:52:07.233 --> 00:52:13.376]  He met with President Trump a few weeks ago and the fact of the matter is he can't control a presidential directive.
[00:52:13.396 --> 00:52:14.477]  He can try to take money.
[00:52:14.757 --> 00:52:24.342]  Not shockingly, a very corrupt individual is going to try to take money from law-abiding citizens and put it in the hands and access of non-law-abiding citizens and people who shouldn't legally be here.
[00:52:24.462 --> 00:52:25.483]  Yeah, they're not even citizens.
[00:52:25.543 --> 00:52:33.769]  But yes, you were pointing out how he's going to be taking this million dollars that was earmarked for a widely ignored property tax rebate in Chicago.
[00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:36.071]  So here we have homeowners that don't understand.
[00:52:36.131 --> 00:52:40.354]  They haven't really been shown that, hey, there's a property tax rebate out there, a million dollars earmarked.
[00:52:40.934 --> 00:52:41.794]  And they haven't taken it.
[00:52:41.954 --> 00:52:46.715]  So far they're saying only about 11,000 people have signed up for this property.
[00:52:46.735 --> 00:52:49.236]  It's 7% of the eligible homeowners.
[00:52:49.536 --> 00:53:00.419]  So they're going to go ahead and take that money that was set aside for these homeowners, this property tax rebate, and then give that to this legal aid fund for people who are afraid of deportation.
[00:53:00.799 --> 00:53:02.099]  And here's what I think is really funny.
[00:53:02.319 --> 00:53:09.461]  Rahm Emanuel says, I want them to know that the city of Chicago, your children, you and your family are safe, secure, and supported.
[00:53:09.721 --> 00:53:13.283]  We're going to put resources to ensuring that you're safe, secure and supported.
[00:53:13.923 --> 00:53:21.968]  Meanwhile, look, so I guess it's just if you're here illegally, not if you are a black person living in Chicago, you're likely to get shot if you're out on the weekends.
[00:53:21.988 --> 00:53:24.570]  I mean, what is it like 45 people every single weekend?
[00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:26.251]  They're getting shot in that city.
[00:53:26.551 --> 00:53:29.993]  So he doesn't care that those families are safe, secure and supported.
[00:53:30.033 --> 00:53:32.534]  He's done absolutely nothing about the gun violence in Chicago.
[00:53:32.915 --> 00:53:35.576]  But if you're here illegally, you're fine.
[00:53:35.596 --> 00:53:36.757]  They're going to pay for you.
[00:53:37.017 --> 00:53:43.922]  And some of the major offenders right now are obviously in LA, in San Francisco, Supervisor Campos.
[00:53:43.962 --> 00:53:53.788]  Here in Austin, Mayor Steve Adler is colluding with President Obama to go around the governor's wishes with the sanctuary city here in Austin.
[00:53:54.209 --> 00:53:56.390]  And then of course, as you mentioned, Rahm Emanuel.
[00:53:58.126 --> 00:54:00.927]  It's funny to me, and of course you've got other cities as well.
[00:54:00.987 --> 00:54:07.788]  You've got people in New York, Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, LA, Oakland, Providence, Santa Fe, Denver, DC.
[00:54:07.888 --> 00:54:13.390]  All of these cities are trying to remain sanctuary cities despite Donald Trump cutting the federal funding.
[00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:16.811]  And you can go look at these stories and see where they plan on getting this money.
[00:54:17.231 --> 00:54:19.371]  They're taking it from state, local taxes.
[00:54:19.751 --> 00:54:21.232]  But it's funny to me, as you mentioned,
[00:54:22.512 --> 00:54:25.875]  What about, you know, they say they want to keep these families together, okay?
[00:54:25.895 --> 00:54:26.635]  That's what they're saying.
[00:54:26.955 --> 00:54:32.660]  Well, what about the families that you tear apart because he was selling drugs and now he has to go to jail for life?
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:36.463]  Or he was drunk driving and now he has to go to jail and can't work or whatever.
[00:54:36.743 --> 00:54:37.744]  They don't seem to mind that.
[00:54:37.804 --> 00:54:44.389]  Another thing they say is, well, we want to protect, you know, non-citizens from being questioned about their citizen status.
[00:54:44.429 --> 00:54:44.829]  But again,
[00:54:45.149 --> 00:54:51.335]  When you pull me over, you question me about my speeding, you question me if I have any drugs in the car, have I been drinking, do I have any guns?
[00:54:51.615 --> 00:54:55.178]  So why is it that the non-citizens get this special treatment?
[00:54:55.198 --> 00:54:55.859]  What do you think, Maggie?
[00:54:56.059 --> 00:55:01.444]  I think that it's appalling and, you know, I'm really encouraged because of the direction our country is going in right now.
[00:55:01.704 --> 00:55:04.847]  There was a case, I'm from the Kentucky-Tennessee border, and for
[00:55:05.607 --> 00:55:05.807]  I don't
[00:55:23.055 --> 00:55:33.004]  We're reaching on the point of madness here when it comes to immigration policy in this country, and it isn't the local mayor's job to enforce the immigration policy, thank goodness.
[00:55:33.344 --> 00:55:42.772]  We have major agencies to do that for us, like ICE for example, and it's up to the president to stick to his promises that he made to Americans, and this is a very significant one.
[00:55:43.092 --> 00:55:46.996]  He promised to get a handle on this because it's us who pays for it if he doesn't.
[00:55:47.392 --> 00:55:51.233]  So the Democrats in the state and the local governments are obviously going to try to fight this.
[00:55:51.333 --> 00:55:52.934]  Leanne, do you think they're going to be successful?
[00:55:53.514 --> 00:55:54.914]  Well, it'll be very interesting to see.
[00:55:54.954 --> 00:56:02.136]  I mean, obviously here in Austin, Texas, the sheriff and others are going to have the support of the mass amount of immigrants that we do have here in the city.
[00:56:02.536 --> 00:56:11.278]  You know, of course, I'm going to play devil's advocate here for a minute and say, you know, this system that they have, there should be kind of a priority list.
[00:56:11.298 --> 00:56:16.240]  We need to make sure that it's the people that are here illegally, that are criminal, you know, that they're committing crime.
[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:26.387]  You know, if someone comes in and it's someone's dad and I don't know why he's coming in, I think that there has to be kind of a priority because there is some massive congestion here with this deportation list.
[00:56:26.828 --> 00:56:36.755]  And so, you know, if there's a way that Trump or, you know, the mayors, these local governments can actually work on maybe the priority list for the deportation, I'm an advocate for that.
[00:56:36.956 --> 00:56:45.162]  But, you know, they're just saying altogether they're not going to be holding anyone that's here illegally for ICE to come take away because of the congestion of this program.
[00:56:45.342 --> 00:56:52.184]  And how do you reason providing these funds, these legal funds, to protect the non-citizens from getting deported?
[00:56:52.424 --> 00:56:56.665]  You are literally now taking taxpayer dollars to support breaking the law.
[00:56:56.965 --> 00:56:57.625]  That's absolutely right.
[00:56:57.665 --> 00:57:06.688]  We're talking about people assuming those taxpayer dollars that most likely have not paid into a system that all of us are legally required to pay into, or we go to jail.
[00:57:06.748 --> 00:57:09.028]  That's how this works, and yet they can take advantage of it.
[00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:10.549]  There's, you know, law and order.
[00:57:11.229 --> 00:57:12.529]  It's upside down right now.
[00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:14.630]  Rahm Emanuel is such a classic example of that.
[00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:26.213]  One can only hope that he suffers the same fate of the Illinois Governor Blagojevich for his corruption because we're talking about somebody with a massive history of corruption and his character is so expressed in things like this.
[00:57:26.293 --> 00:57:27.893]  You know, who does he think he is?
[00:57:28.333 --> 00:57:31.034]  He is like a mafia, so you're absolutely right about that.
[00:57:31.494 --> 00:57:37.403]  So, and again, the major stories, at least for me, leading the way is L.A.
[00:57:37.583 --> 00:57:44.093]  taking $10 million funds to provide legal assistance for illegal residents facing deportation.
[00:57:44.153 --> 00:57:46.156]  Isn't California about to file bankruptcy?
[00:57:46.676 --> 00:57:51.818]  Oh yeah, they're in debt more than any other state in the union.
[00:57:51.878 --> 00:57:55.559]  San Francisco supervisor campus to seek funding to block deportations.
[00:57:56.059 --> 00:58:01.381]  Austin mayor colludes with President Obama to go above the head of Governor Abbott and his wishes.
[00:58:01.401 --> 00:58:03.422]  Of course Rahm Emanuel and other cities.
[00:58:03.802 --> 00:58:06.023]  So here's how I kind of want to bring this home.
[00:58:07.233 --> 00:58:09.875]  Folks, you need to pay attention to what's going on, okay?
[00:58:10.156 --> 00:58:14.579]  Because they're going to use your tax dollars for these programs.
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:22.566]  If you live in a sanctuary city, it's more important now than ever to pay attention to what your local representation is doing.
[00:58:22.906 --> 00:58:24.308]  Where are they getting these funds?
[00:58:24.668 --> 00:58:28.992]  Why are they pushing for legal representation for non-citizens?
[00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:31.213]  I guarantee you, I live here in Austin.
[00:58:32.262 --> 00:58:39.524]  I cannot leave my house and go shopping somewhere and not see at least three or four homeless people on the street.
[00:58:39.964 --> 00:58:47.406]  Why is it that illegal non-citizens who break the law are going to receive money from your tax dollars?
[00:58:47.646 --> 00:58:52.047]  Why do we have government representation that is more concerned with non-citizens than citizens?
[00:58:52.287 --> 00:58:54.628]  You need to be very vigilant of this in the coming days.
[00:58:54.968 --> 00:58:59.009]  Make sure that they're not taking your tax dollars to support non-citizens.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.930]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:20.115]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.435 --> 00:59:24.176]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.737 --> 00:59:27.578]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
