[00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:22.086]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:26.009]  It is Tuesday, March 22, 2016 and I'm Leigh-Anne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:27.390]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.107 --> 00:00:41.618]  Tonight, ISIS claims responsibility for the Brussels attack, and the global elite respond by calling for an all-out invasion of Syria.
[00:00:42.098 --> 00:00:48.484]  Meanwhile, the Democrats want to utilize the tragedy for an excuse to expand the police state.
[00:00:48.504 --> 00:00:50.807]  You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.
[00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:56.069]  And you can't say there was no warning of an impending terrorist attack in Brussels.
[00:00:56.509 --> 00:01:00.171]  Flashback to an interview with Donald Trump on Fox News.
[00:01:00.611 --> 00:01:02.212]  There's something going on, Maria.
[00:01:02.492 --> 00:01:03.312]  Go to Brussels.
[00:01:03.653 --> 00:01:04.473]  Go to Paris.
[00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:07.354]  And it's not good where they want Sharia law.
[00:01:07.514 --> 00:01:08.355]  You go to Brussels.
[00:01:08.455 --> 00:01:10.816]  I was in Brussels a long time ago, 20 years ago.
[00:01:11.176 --> 00:01:13.757]  So beautiful, everything's so beautiful.
[00:01:13.777 --> 00:01:15.818]  It's like living in a hellhole right now.
[00:01:16.038 --> 00:01:20.160]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:05.615]  A terror attack rocked Brussels, Belgium today.
[00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:10.681]  34 people have died so far and nearly 200 others have been injured.
[00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:19.071]  Now, there were two bombs that went off at the Brussels airport and another went off on the metro train, injuring all of those people.
[00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:24.074]  The foreign ministry there says some terrorists involved in the deadly plot are still at large.
[00:03:24.734 --> 00:03:29.757]  The armed police had a dramatic standoff and they arrested two men in the city center.
[00:03:30.398 --> 00:03:32.619]  They also have conducted dozens of raids.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.104]  They swooped on a number of suspects as the Belgian foreign ministry said that many of those behind this terror plot are still at large.
[00:03:40.464 --> 00:03:45.047]  So, due to some CCTV footage, they've revealed a picture of three of the suspects.
[00:03:45.207 --> 00:03:51.451]  Two of those were reportedly killed in suicide attacks, and another man is now believed to be on the run.
[00:03:52.512 --> 00:04:03.900]  It emerged that this afternoon police, during one of these raids, discovered nail bombs, a number of chemical products, and an ISIS flag at a house in the area in connection with this morning's attacks.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.845]  And of course, you know, ISIS has already come out claiming responsibility for these attacks in Brussels.
[00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:14.188]  They released a statement through one of their propaganda channels.
[00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:22.835]  They said that this attack in Belgium, that it was targeted as a country participating in the international coalition against the Islamic State.
[00:04:23.235 --> 00:04:31.942]  But that doesn't really make a lot of sense because the country only carried out a limited bombing campaign confined to Iraq and they stopped those airstrikes in June 2015.
[00:04:34.104 --> 00:04:45.193]  So the timing of these attacks is a little more likely that it's a retaliatory attack for the arrest of one of the Paris attack suspects, Salah Abdeslam.
[00:04:45.614 --> 00:04:48.836]  Now our reporter Joe Biggs was actually on the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:04:49.016 --> 00:04:50.658]  We'll be playing that coming up later in the show.
[00:04:51.118 --> 00:05:01.973]  He was positing this idea that not only was it a retaliatory attack because of this, but also it could have been a diversionary attack to take some of the heat there.
[00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:06.038]  We know that they've had armed guards around this area in Molenbeek for months.
[00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.340]  They're after these Paris terror attacks.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:22.485]  And so this could have been sort of a diversionary attack to take some of the presence away from that area and allow some of these jihadis that are being protected in this neighborhood in Molenbeek, allow them an opportunity to escape, regroup.
[00:05:23.686 --> 00:05:28.348]  So, I mean, ISIS here, they also say, you know, this is just the beginning, more to come.
[00:05:29.511 --> 00:05:43.444]  And of course, we have reports of ISIS supporters championing these attacks on Twitter, which for whatever reason, Twitter allows this hashtag to be trending, and they're saying, you know, we have come to you with slaughter.
[00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:46.047]  Just, it's just ridiculously sick stuff.
[00:05:46.687 --> 00:05:49.270]  Now, of course, never let a crisis go to waste.
[00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:56.437]  The Democrats are already automatically expanding for a police state measures, expansion of police state measures at airports.
[00:05:56.957 --> 00:06:00.120]  They want to expand TSA search perimeters.
[00:06:00.841 --> 00:06:04.444]  And so these are additional security measures at airports.
[00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:18.113]  And Senator Chuckie Schumer said, when we do, it's going to be critically important that we look again at the safety and security of our transit systems to ensure this type of attack doesn't occur on American soil.
[00:06:18.413 --> 00:06:21.655]  So earlier today, they rushed through a voice voted legislation.
[00:06:22.096 --> 00:06:25.278]  It extends authorization for the FAA through July 15th.
[00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:38.073]  It'll tighten the vetting process for TSA employees, more emphasis on counterterrorism training and funding for those efforts, of course, more money, and Democrats are calling for expanding security perimeters at the airports.
[00:06:38.493 --> 00:06:41.477]  So, the Brussels attacks occurred at the ticketing area.
[00:06:41.857 --> 00:07:00.791]  So of course this means that any passengers who are now arriving at the airport are going to be subjected to naked body scanners, intrusive searches, police squads with automatic weapons, and of course profilers looking for behavioral indicators of terrorism before they even reach the gate.
[00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:09.440]  And we've already seen how the TSA has expanded its perimeters to include rodeos, football games, highway way stations, and train terminals.
[00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:16.188]  So again, this is the security theater that, in order to protect us, they have to build a prison around us.
[00:07:16.328 --> 00:07:17.249]  And this is exactly
[00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.293]  What the terrorists want, they want to win.
[00:07:20.793 --> 00:07:24.077]  Now, we know how Trump has responded to this.
[00:07:24.137 --> 00:07:26.559]  Trump wants to expand the police state.
[00:07:26.619 --> 00:07:27.420]  He is all for it.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.403]  Now, let's take a look at what Hillary Clinton would do.
[00:07:31.084 --> 00:07:35.949]  She says, you know, Trump says he wants to close off the borders to everyone, shut them down.
[00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:39.453]  Well, Clinton says that's unrealistic, which I don't disagree with her.
[00:07:41.778 --> 00:07:57.012]  Just to get an idea of how a President Hillary Clinton would handle it, look to 2012 when the State Department, then headed by Clinton, ordered the TSA not to subject the Muslim Brotherhood to a pat-down or most types of screening.
[00:07:57.472 --> 00:08:02.037]  This was according to a one-page document that was obtained by the Investigative Project on Terrorism.
[00:08:02.677 --> 00:08:14.745]  And it showed that members of a Muslim Brotherhood delegation that were traveling through Minneapolis Airport and New York's JFK Airport and Dulles Airport were handed expedited entry known as port courtesy.
[00:08:15.874 --> 00:08:25.156]  And the document contains four separate entries which include a directive that Muslim Brotherhood members not be pulled into secondary upon arrival at the point of entry.
[00:08:25.716 --> 00:08:35.858]  And prior to their trip to the state, so prior to that, the Muslim Brotherhood was labeled a terrorist organization by the Egyptian government for the bombing of a police station.
[00:08:36.238 --> 00:08:38.859]  And of course the man who was in that delegation
[00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.541]  Well, he wasn't even elected as the president or anything yet.
[00:08:41.601 --> 00:08:49.347]  So he was given port courtesy, which is normally reserved for high ranking government officials, of which he was not one at the time.
[00:08:49.808 --> 00:08:52.670]  So contrived security theater for all the rest of us.
[00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.573]  Meanwhile, terrorist organization Muslim Brotherhood can just come on in.
[00:08:56.613 --> 00:08:58.514]  They don't need any secondary checks.
[00:08:59.295 --> 00:09:03.397]  Now, Ted Cruz, of course, he's not blaming jihadis.
[00:09:03.437 --> 00:09:04.638]  He's not blaming ISIS.
[00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:16.283]  He's not blaming any Muslim Brotherhood or even the Empire, which has caused all of this global unrest in order to exact all of their resources.
[00:09:16.963 --> 00:09:19.744]  Ted Cruz is blaming Donald Trump for Brussels.
[00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:24.687]  He said, Trump said that the United States can no longer afford NATO.
[00:09:25.107 --> 00:09:27.268]  And so this is what Ted Cruz had to say.
[00:09:29.352 --> 00:09:51.344]  Well, I will say it is striking that the day after Donald Trump called for America weakening NATO, withdrawing from NATO, we see Brussels, where NATO is headquartered, the subject of a radical Islamic terrorist attack.
[00:09:52.318 --> 00:10:00.600]  And of course, globalist think tanks that bolster support for NATO have immediately used this crisis to call for the invasion of Syria.
[00:10:01.061 --> 00:10:05.542]  Now, this is a former advisor to Hillary Clinton on Syria, Frederick C. Hoff.
[00:10:05.602 --> 00:10:11.544]  He's now a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Rafiq Harari Center for the Middle East.
[00:10:11.884 --> 00:10:16.145]  He's calling for invading Syria in the wake of the deadly attacks in Brussels.
[00:10:16.505 --> 00:10:23.912]  He says, killing ISIS in Syria can ease the migration crisis and hasten the demise of this murderous band in Iraq.
[00:10:24.352 --> 00:10:26.574]  Ooh, everything that everyone is so concerned with.
[00:10:26.674 --> 00:10:28.416]  Why aren't we killing ISIS in Syria?
[00:10:28.836 --> 00:10:31.959]  Let's ease this migration crisis and hasten the demise.
[00:10:32.379 --> 00:10:35.902]  And this is exactly what we've been saying is problem, reaction, solution.
[00:10:36.403 --> 00:10:38.064]  And of course, the American
[00:10:39.065 --> 00:10:43.248]  This Atlantic Council is aligned with NATO.
[00:10:43.328 --> 00:10:49.471]  They are established in 1961 by former Secretaries of State Dean Atkinson and Christian Herter.
[00:10:49.791 --> 00:10:52.813]  It was created to bolster support for NATO.
[00:10:53.053 --> 00:10:56.896]  So here he is immediately saying, well, we need to get in there in Syria and take out ISIS.
[00:10:56.956 --> 00:11:04.560]  Mind you, no one had even heard about ISIS until the US rejected going into ISIS in 2013, going into war with Syria.
[00:11:06.201 --> 00:11:06.501]  I think.
[00:11:29.138 --> 00:11:29.198]  Yes.
[00:11:59.238 --> 00:11:59.318]  Yes.
[00:12:15.848 --> 00:12:28.277]  And expanding the power of the police state, the attack will be exploited to move against Assad under the cover of attacking the Islamic State, which of course is a creation of the Pentagon during its occupation of Iraq.
[00:12:28.357 --> 00:12:34.001]  Because again, like I said, ISIS wasn't even on the radar until the U.S.
[00:12:34.522 --> 00:12:38.465]  didn't want to go with Obama's red line and go into war with Syria.
[00:12:38.505 --> 00:12:39.926]  So this is all manufactured
[00:12:40.566 --> 00:12:41.827]  These are real terror attacks.
[00:12:41.947 --> 00:12:46.929]  These are real terrorists we're dealing with, but they're being utilized.
[00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:52.592]  Now, Ted Cruz, of course, mentioned to him earlier how he went to blame Donald Trump.
[00:12:53.192 --> 00:12:58.115]  Well, now he's kind of echoing some of the things that Donald Trump has said, and he's facing some backlash for it.
[00:12:58.835 --> 00:13:09.119]  He has called for law enforcement saying that they should be allowed to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.
[00:13:09.519 --> 00:13:11.740]  Oh my goodness, so racist.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:18.543]  Now, this is Senator Charles Schumer there, a Democrat out of New York.
[00:13:19.223 --> 00:13:21.724]  He says, that's not what we do in America.
[00:13:22.364 --> 00:13:26.586]  We don't take race, religion, creed, color, and say we're going to monitor everyone.
[00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:28.386]  Well, I'm sorry.
[00:13:28.506 --> 00:13:34.989]  I beg to disagree there with you, Chuckie Schumer, because that's exactly what New York did.
[00:13:35.309 --> 00:13:40.331]  You'll remember that they're facing some backlash now, paying off a really hefty lawsuit.
[00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:51.339]  For the secret NYPD surveillance program that they had to repeal because it was violating constitutional rights of people that they were spying on these Muslim neighborhoods after 9-11.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:14:04.370]  Well, of course, now they have done away with that secret surveillance program and we have others wanting to come in to reinstate that program before something like what happened in Brussels today happens here.
[00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:07.712]  Now, this is something that Trump has been talking about
[00:14:08.393 --> 00:14:08.713]  I don't
[00:14:23.814 --> 00:14:39.707]  They were countering this idea that it was an Islamist hellhole, and they even put out this video saying, you know, call in, and you could call to random phone booths throughout the city where a seemingly random stranger would pick it up and go, no, Belgium, this Brussels is a great place.
[00:14:39.768 --> 00:14:41.269]  No, I don't see any terrorists here.
[00:14:42.089 --> 00:14:43.991]  So they wanted to counter that campaign.
[00:14:44.452 --> 00:14:48.235]  Here's what Donald Trump was warning about earlier this year.
[00:14:49.554 --> 00:14:51.195]  There's something going on, Maria.
[00:14:51.475 --> 00:14:52.275]  Go to Brussels.
[00:14:52.635 --> 00:14:53.436]  Go to Paris.
[00:14:53.796 --> 00:14:55.097]  Go to different places.
[00:14:55.557 --> 00:14:56.837]  There's something going on.
[00:14:57.017 --> 00:14:57.978]  And it's not good.
[00:14:58.318 --> 00:14:59.679]  Where they want Sharia law.
[00:14:59.759 --> 00:15:00.639]  Where they want this.
[00:15:00.679 --> 00:15:04.101]  Where they want things that... You know, there has to be some assimilation.
[00:15:04.261 --> 00:15:05.401]  There is no assimilation.
[00:15:05.741 --> 00:15:07.302]  There's something bad going on.
[00:15:07.442 --> 00:15:11.484]  And until we find out what it is, so we can correct it... You go to Brussels.
[00:15:11.584 --> 00:15:13.265]  I was in Brussels a long time ago.
[00:15:13.505 --> 00:15:13.925]  20 years ago.
[00:15:14.285 --> 00:15:15.246]  So beautiful.
[00:15:15.306 --> 00:15:16.106]  Everything's so beautiful.
[00:15:16.909 --> 00:15:18.952]  It's like living in a hellhole right now.
[00:15:19.452 --> 00:15:27.982]  And of course, everyone was originally insulting Trump and saying how dare he talk about the Belgian capital like that and how dare he say it's an Islamist hellhole.
[00:15:28.343 --> 00:15:32.327]  And then, when this attack takes place, who's the first person they get on the phone?
[00:15:32.688 --> 00:15:33.429]  Donald Trump!
[00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:43.455]  And of course he doubles down on this saying that Islamic terrorists have turned magical places into cities of fear and armed camps.
[00:15:44.035 --> 00:15:55.742]  And he was describing how, speaking with Fox & Friends, Trump was describing how Brussels would be the latest city to be attacked and it's gone from one of the best places in the world to a hub for violent extremists.
[00:15:56.183 --> 00:16:03.367]  And he also called for shoring up US borders in an effort not to let beautiful cities here become havens for Islamic
[00:16:03.607 --> 00:16:04.149]  Extremists.
[00:16:05.652 --> 00:16:10.564]  If you do become president and we're in a situation like this, what would you do to protect America?
[00:16:12.225 --> 00:16:13.766]  Well, again, I think I've said it.
[00:16:13.946 --> 00:16:18.369]  I would close up our borders to people until we figure out what is going on.
[00:16:18.429 --> 00:16:19.570]  Look at Brussels.
[00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:20.391]  Look at Paris.
[00:16:20.451 --> 00:16:23.233]  Look at so many cities that were great cities.
[00:16:23.313 --> 00:16:26.015]  Paris is almost as bad.
[00:16:26.275 --> 00:16:30.278]  You look at other places where the same thing has happened, and they're in fear.
[00:16:30.358 --> 00:16:31.459]  The city's in fear.
[00:16:32.359 --> 00:16:34.581]  And we have to be smart in the United States.
[00:16:35.427 --> 00:16:50.656]  Now, mind you, Donald Trump was on Wolf Blitzer tonight talking about one of the first things he's going to do if he's elected is expanding the surveillance state, building that wall, and even changing the laws so that we can have some waterboarding to deal with these terrorists.
[00:16:50.937 --> 00:16:58.401]  So that to me is pretty frightening, something that we all need to be a little bit concerned about as we are keeping our eyes on the rise of Donald Trump.
[00:16:59.682 --> 00:17:00.102]  You know what?
[00:17:00.122 --> 00:17:04.145]  It can't be worse than the current president that we have in office.
[00:17:04.465 --> 00:17:12.850]  Take a look at what he was doing just several moments after addressing for 40 seconds the latest terror attack that was taking place in Brussels.
[00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:27.799]  Yes, that is President Obama, the leader of the free world, sitting next to Raul Castro at a baseball game in Cuba, doing the wave there on his little family vacation on the taxpayer's dime.
[00:17:28.619 --> 00:17:32.281]  And again, Brussels, please, he stands in solidarity with you, Belgium.
[00:17:32.321 --> 00:17:34.522]  He's very, very upset about everything that's happened.
[00:17:34.962 --> 00:17:38.524]  But of course, it cannot cut into his vacation time.
[00:17:39.884 --> 00:17:44.566]  Now, coming up, we are going to be playing an excerpt from the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:17:44.906 --> 00:17:54.831]  Tim Kennedy joined us, and he was talking about a lot of these leftist policies that are going to be importing terror to the West, and the fact that they want more terror.
[00:17:55.251 --> 00:18:00.296]  Because that will allow them to take our freedoms and expand the police state as we are already seeing.
[00:18:00.617 --> 00:18:04.281]  In fact, we might even be demanding that they build the wall.
[00:18:04.521 --> 00:18:07.344]  We demand that you keep us safe from all of these terrorists.
[00:18:07.624 --> 00:18:12.129]  We want you to reinstate the secret surveillance program on these Muslim communities.
[00:18:12.369 --> 00:18:12.990]  So it's just...
[00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:16.513]  Everywhere you look, I feel like our reality is being controlled.
[00:18:17.074 --> 00:18:19.176]  We're also going to be playing a report from David Knight.
[00:18:19.256 --> 00:18:23.240]  He's been on the ground there at one of the Trump rallies in New York City.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.862]  So all of that is coming up.
[00:18:25.022 --> 00:18:26.023]  You're not going to want to miss it.
[00:18:29.426 --> 00:18:35.930]  We're living in some kind of Orwellian nightmare now, and that everything that you hear now contributes to turning you into a robot.
[00:18:36.211 --> 00:18:46.057]  I think that New York is the new model for the new concentration camp, where the camp has been built by the inmates themselves, and the inmates are the guards, and they have this pride in this thing they've built.
[00:18:46.297 --> 00:18:59.026]  They've built their own prison, and so they exist in a state of schizophrenia, where they are both guards and prisoners, and as a result they no longer have, having been lobotomized, the capacity to leave the prison they've made, or to even see it.
[00:18:59.326 --> 00:18:59.410]  Yeah.
[00:19:02.702 --> 00:19:06.124]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:19:06.485 --> 00:19:13.609]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:22.575]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:19:22.815 --> 00:19:26.938]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:19:27.258 --> 00:19:32.602]  Pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:19:32.602 --> 00:19:32.862]  Let's do it!
[00:20:01.218 --> 00:20:15.429]  My fellow InfoWarriors, I am very excited to be able to announce to you the introduction at InfoWarsLife.com of a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsLife formulations like Survival Shield X2 and Super Metal Vitality.

[00:20:44.087 --> 00:20:44.688]  We're good to go.
[00:21:00.831 --> 00:21:06.314]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:21:06.574 --> 00:21:21.023]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:21:21.283 --> 00:21:29.112]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.

[00:21:42.546 --> 00:21:50.368]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:21:50.528 --> 00:21:55.949]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:21:55.969 --> 00:21:59.510]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:03.691]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:22:03.791 --> 00:22:07.672]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:22:08.112 --> 00:22:12.134]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.
[00:22:12.234 --> 00:22:17.216]  Secure your Liver Shield today exclusively at Infowarslife.com for the lowest price available.

[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:26.727]  Immediately following the Brussels-Belgium airport and subway bombings, killing at least 30 and wounding 230, world leaders raised their voices to once again demonstrate their true lack of understanding of the perspective of the people.
[00:23:27.067 --> 00:23:35.210]  Instead, bleeding out like sheep, the same old message of vigilance and security theater we have all grown to loathe.
[00:23:40.921 --> 00:23:53.047]  Four hundred extra police officers have been deployed in the airports in the Ile-de-France area, that's Roissy and Orly, and in public areas.
[00:23:53.127 --> 00:23:54.508]  All levels of government in Germany.
[00:24:02.322 --> 00:24:09.465]  We're working towards the goal to provide maximum security for the people of Germany.
[00:24:09.705 --> 00:24:22.169]  The Charlie Hebdo, Paris and San Bernardino massacres should be a clear indication that the claims of ISIS that this is only the start of the storm aren't to be taken lightly.
[00:24:22.469 --> 00:24:25.070]  And these attacks were undertaken by a wave of ISIS
[00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:32.456]  That was allowed to grow in the belly of Europe like a cancer, a caliphate disguised as the huddled masses.
[00:24:32.957 --> 00:24:42.485]  But it was Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump whose comments flew through the fog of New World Order drivel to alert those with ears to listen.
[00:24:42.625 --> 00:24:52.288]  With the chopping off of the heads and what's going on, the brutality, you've got to hit ISIS so hard and you've got to take them out and not play tiddlywinks like we're playing right now.
[00:24:52.448 --> 00:24:54.069]  There's something going on, Maria.
[00:24:54.349 --> 00:24:55.169]  Go to Brussels.
[00:24:55.529 --> 00:24:56.329]  Go to Paris.
[00:24:56.689 --> 00:24:57.990]  Go to different places.
[00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.730]  There's something going on.
[00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:04.552]  And it's not good where they want Sharia law, where they want this, where they want things that
[00:25:05.192 --> 00:25:06.953]  You know, there has to be some assimilation.
[00:25:07.133 --> 00:25:08.254]  There is no assimilation.
[00:25:08.314 --> 00:25:09.974]  What do you think of the New York Times?
[00:25:10.395 --> 00:25:13.016]  They took you to task about your assessment of Brussels.
[00:25:13.056 --> 00:25:13.756]  Were you right?
[00:25:14.357 --> 00:25:14.777]  Of course.
[00:25:14.857 --> 00:25:15.937]  I mean, you take a look at it.
[00:25:16.117 --> 00:25:17.738]  Brussels is a disaster.
[00:25:17.978 --> 00:25:28.223]  Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz played his hand early, immediately demonizing Trump's rhetoric while the body count in Belgium continued to rise.
[00:25:29.144 --> 00:25:33.426]  It is striking that the day after Donald Trump called
[00:25:34.764 --> 00:25:43.645]  For America weakening NATO, withdrawing from NATO, we see Brussels, where NATO is headquartered.
[00:25:44.764 --> 00:25:48.307]  The subject of a radical Islamic terrorist attack.
[00:25:48.367 --> 00:25:59.516]  President Obama, not to be ignored, asked to be indulged on the matter and then proceeded to spew out more divisive and failed leadership rhetoric.
[00:25:59.776 --> 00:26:00.597]  Please indulge me.
[00:26:00.657 --> 00:26:05.000]  I want to comment on the terrorist attacks that have taken place in Brussels.
[00:26:06.621 --> 00:26:09.364]  And this is yet another reminder that the world must unite.
[00:26:11.786 --> 00:26:21.853]  We must be together, regardless of nationality or race or faith, in fighting against the scourge of terrorism.
[00:26:22.854 --> 00:26:28.498]  Clearly, the elite speak a completely different language than the average citizen.
[00:26:28.996 --> 00:26:33.140]  And their New World Order motives are blatantly obvious at this point.
[00:26:33.721 --> 00:26:45.912]  Are we all truly prepared to endure exponential suicide bombings on the scale and scope witnessed for decades in the Middle East, now shifting to Europe and the United States?
[00:26:46.432 --> 00:26:48.835]  Or will we finally hold the globalist puppets
[00:26:49.275 --> 00:27:01.003]  David Knight for Infowars.com.
[00:27:01.164 --> 00:27:05.987]  I'm here in Colonial Williamsburg and every time I spend or have to go to Washington D.C.
[00:27:06.628 --> 00:27:15.154]  and witness this empire that has become everything that the founders of this country detested, I like to come by this place because it's a meticulous recreation.
[00:27:16.015 --> 00:27:19.922]  of the American colonies right as the American Revolution was beginning.
[00:27:21.113 --> 00:27:26.196]  And it's nice to reattach to these founding principles, to the optimism, to the liberty that was there.
[00:27:27.116 --> 00:27:28.717]  Behind me is the House of Burgess.
[00:27:28.937 --> 00:27:33.139]  This is where the legislative body met for Virginia.
[00:27:33.599 --> 00:27:36.101]  And in this other direction, over here, is Shields Tavern.
[00:27:36.641 --> 00:27:38.422]  Shields Tavern was where we just ate lunch.
[00:27:38.482 --> 00:27:43.464]  And what they do is they have historical and actors, people in costume, who will come by your table.
[00:27:43.524 --> 00:27:50.108]  They'll talk to the crowd in the room, give them some stories about what life was like at the time, and character.
[00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:57.226]  This lady was saying that they would like to run up large bills because they didn't like to handle a lot of money.
[00:27:58.857 --> 00:28:01.299]  She said that they would take the dollars, they would cut them into pieces of eight.
[00:28:01.339 --> 00:28:06.603]  That's a whole other story I won't go into, but she told us about one particular customer, George Washington.
[00:28:07.243 --> 00:28:14.969]  She said he ran up a rather large bill of 21 days, staying there, food and lodging, and he left that bill for over a year and a half, and that was not uncommon.
[00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:21.434]  But he came by here and settled his bill in 1775 as he was on his way to the Continental Congress.
[00:28:21.934 --> 00:28:23.475]  Concord and Lexington had just happened.
[00:28:23.956 --> 00:28:25.037]  He knew there was going to be a war.
[00:28:25.097 --> 00:28:27.618]  He thought he might die, so he wanted to settle his accounts.
[00:28:28.419 --> 00:28:32.882]  She also talked about how when he went to the Continental Congress, he met with John Adams.
[00:28:33.823 --> 00:28:46.613]  John Adams, a man who doesn't like anyone, did not like anyone, took a great deal of liking to George Washington, thought he was a very intelligent and honest man, said he was going to nominate him to be the commanding general of the Continental Army.
[00:28:47.453 --> 00:28:50.236]  And he did that the next day, and George Washington showed up in uniform,
[00:28:51.124 --> 00:28:59.452]  He was nominated, and showing up in uniform was not to impress people, but it was to quietly convey that he was available for the office.
[00:29:00.594 --> 00:29:02.475]  Very understated way to do this.
[00:29:02.936 --> 00:29:05.478]  As they nominated him and proceeded to vote, he left.
[00:29:06.399 --> 00:29:09.442]  Now I want to contrast that with Ted Cruz.
[00:29:10.512 --> 00:29:14.475]  A man who epitomizes ruthless ambition without principles.
[00:29:14.955 --> 00:29:16.477]  Dishonest and desperate.
[00:29:17.337 --> 00:29:29.006]  We've seen Ted Cruz, just in the last couple of weeks, throw Donald Trump and his supporters under the bus saying they were to blame because they didn't use the gentle language of political correctness.
[00:29:29.887 --> 00:29:43.834]  Saying that they were to blame for the people who infiltrated their rallies, who aggressively confronted people, and then went out in the parking lot and stopped ambulances, attacked cars that had bumper stickers that they didn't like, damaging those cars.
[00:29:44.815 --> 00:29:49.978]  Today, we see something even more amazing, and I want to read you this quote from Ted Cruz.
[00:29:51.107 --> 00:29:54.689]  This is what he said in response to the shootings in Brussels.
[00:29:55.510 --> 00:30:08.138]  He said, well, I will say it's striking that the day after Donald Trump called for America weakening NATO, withdrawing from NATO, we see Brussels, where NATO is headquartered, the subject of a radical Islamist terror attack.
[00:30:08.579 --> 00:30:12.641]  So Donald Trump is wrong that America should withdraw from the world and abandon our allies.
[00:30:13.062 --> 00:30:16.444]  Donald Trump is wrong that America should retreat from Europe.
[00:30:17.734 --> 00:30:23.599]  Now, I want to ask you, what would the founders of our country say to a man like Ted Cruz?
[00:30:23.979 --> 00:30:40.614]  A man who puts his own personal ambition ahead of the eligibility requirements in the Constitution, who says that we need to be at a state of perpetual war, and who takes every opportunity to throw his political opponents under the bus in the most dishonest ways.
[00:30:41.154 --> 00:30:42.155]  That is Ted Cruz.
[00:30:42.215 --> 00:30:42.876]  It's not enough
[00:30:43.376 --> 00:30:47.458]  for him to go to AIPAC yesterday and be the most groveling of all the candidates.
[00:30:47.498 --> 00:30:55.941]  I thought it was disgusting that we have to have our presidential candidates parade before people who put the foreign interests of another country ahead of America.
[00:30:56.442 --> 00:30:58.903]  We should never put Israel's interests ahead of America.
[00:30:59.323 --> 00:31:01.604]  No other country should be put ahead of America.
[00:31:02.084 --> 00:31:03.465]  We need America first.
[00:31:04.045 --> 00:31:07.568]  This is America, and this is what we're having an election here.
[00:31:07.808 --> 00:31:14.513]  We should not put the interests of Mexico or Israel or France or Belgium, anyone ahead of Americans interest.
[00:31:15.194 --> 00:31:17.395]  But that's what they did for Israel yesterday.
[00:31:17.435 --> 00:31:21.679]  And of all the sycophants there, the worst one was Ted Cruz.
[00:31:22.813 --> 00:31:25.355]  Donald Trump is even saying we need to pull back from NATO.
[00:31:25.375 --> 00:31:28.138]  We need to distance ourselves from the United Nations control.
[00:31:28.218 --> 00:31:32.582]  Even, you know, it's not in your interest, Israel, to have the United Nations controlling your country either.
[00:31:32.622 --> 00:31:35.364]  He's pulling back from the globalism to some degree.
[00:31:35.965 --> 00:31:39.788]  I would like to see a complete repudiation of the American empire.
[00:31:40.765 --> 00:31:44.128]  And we were warned by our founders that it would become despotic at home.
[00:31:44.848 --> 00:31:47.731]  That it would become the very thing that we were fighting abroad.
[00:31:47.751 --> 00:31:51.293]  It was John Adams who said, we don't go abroad seeking monsters to destroy.
[00:31:51.353 --> 00:31:51.794]  Now we do.
[00:31:52.354 --> 00:31:52.754]  Now we do.
[00:31:53.095 --> 00:31:55.897]  And if we don't have those monsters, we create those monsters.
[00:31:56.177 --> 00:32:03.203]  And we keep ourselves perpetually tied together in these foreign entanglements that George Washington warned us about.
[00:32:04.063 --> 00:32:06.866]  For InfoWars.com, at Colonial Williamsburg, I'm David Knight.
[00:32:08.007 --> 00:32:11.148]  As Travis said, we're looking at former heads of state.
[00:32:11.748 --> 00:32:12.168]  Literally.
[00:32:13.489 --> 00:32:16.090]  It's Washington or bust for these guys.
[00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.150]  And it looks like it's bust.
[00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:18.770]  Because they're starting to decay.
[00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:23.032]  This is going to be part of an amusement attraction here in Virginia.
[00:32:23.712 --> 00:32:32.359]  They couldn't find enough interest in the former president, and I think there's a lesson in that for all these people like Ted Cruz and others who are so desperate to become president.
[00:32:32.759 --> 00:32:37.522]  Ted, if you succeed, you're going to end up like these decaying structures out here.
[00:32:37.783 --> 00:32:40.384]  And this is the American empire at its peak.
[00:32:40.445 --> 00:32:41.826]  Here we are in America.
[00:32:42.626 --> 00:32:50.270]  Rich, powerful nation, and yet our former great leaders are reduced to these types of decaying icons.
[00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:56.654]  And of course you can see, if you look at the back of Abraham Lincoln's head, it's anatomically correct post-Ford theater.
[00:33:02.165 --> 00:33:03.786]  The Knowledge of the Ancients.
[00:33:04.127 --> 00:33:07.670]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:10.552]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.

[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:47.821]  We're good.
[00:34:02.042 --> 00:34:08.204]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:34:08.224 --> 00:34:11.526]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:34:11.546 --> 00:34:13.286]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:34:13.326 --> 00:34:19.589]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:34:19.689 --> 00:34:25.611]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:34:25.751 --> 00:34:29.514]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:34:29.694 --> 00:34:32.637]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:34:32.777 --> 00:34:40.803]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:34:41.064 --> 00:34:43.105]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:34:43.145 --> 00:34:44.286]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:34:44.566 --> 00:34:46.248]  It's more vital than ever.
[00:34:46.408 --> 00:34:46.888]  I'm good to go.

[00:37:04.414 --> 00:37:06.035]  Joe Biggs, what is it like for you?
[00:37:06.075 --> 00:37:11.438]  Because again, you were in heavy combat, it was written about in magazines, you had big reporters embedded with your combat unit.
[00:37:11.878 --> 00:37:17.141]  I mean, and you told me on the phone, you're like, listen, this is more dangerous on average than being in country.
[00:37:17.161 --> 00:37:19.423]  A lot of those folks didn't like radical jihadists.
[00:37:19.763 --> 00:37:22.144]  They must have only brought radical jihadists in here.
[00:37:22.524 --> 00:37:24.005]  And that's what the media now admits.
[00:37:24.425 --> 00:37:27.907]  Europe is like picking only the very worst to bring into Europe.
[00:37:28.248 --> 00:37:29.969]  What do you think's going on here, Joe?
[00:37:30.649 --> 00:37:32.612]  Well, first off, I'd like to go into what happened today.
[00:37:32.712 --> 00:37:34.214]  I believe that today was a diversion.
[00:37:35.175 --> 00:37:44.707]  After the capture of Abdul Salam, the other sleeper cells in that Molenbeek area knew that they needed to do something to create a diversion so they can move those cells out of that area.
[00:37:46.784 --> 00:37:47.064]  Brutal.
[00:38:07.597 --> 00:38:09.680]  Shows you that there was some kind of break in that community.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:14.247]  Somebody said something and those guys needed to create a diversion to get out of there.
[00:38:14.868 --> 00:38:16.490]  And I believe there will be more attacks.
[00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.154]  I believe London will be probably one of the next ones.
[00:38:19.515 --> 00:38:21.177]  But I don't think it's over in that area yet.
[00:38:21.197 --> 00:38:22.860]  I think there's going to be a lot more going on.
[00:38:24.192 --> 00:38:31.138]  Getting back, though, to you saying, look, the saturation of anti-Westerners here is the highest I've ever seen on the phone.
[00:38:31.158 --> 00:38:32.219]  And I'm like, really, Joe?
[00:38:32.659 --> 00:38:37.003]  And you're like, yes, these people are trying to ram us with cars, in our faces, throwing us out everywhere.
[00:38:37.023 --> 00:38:38.824]  It goes for miles and miles.
[00:38:39.585 --> 00:38:41.146]  And you were really shocked.
[00:38:41.546 --> 00:38:43.168]  You said it's worse than we even were told.
[00:38:43.448 --> 00:38:50.814]  And then they say Donald Trump's a conspiracy theorist for saying there's no go zones in London, no go zones in Brussels, no go zones in Paris.
[00:38:51.414 --> 00:38:53.096]  I was completely mind blown at the fact that
[00:38:53.616 --> 00:39:01.239]  People were writing these, you know, comments on these YouTube videos where, you know, we had done the radio show that night with you, and we're saying that we've been chased out of there.
[00:39:01.259 --> 00:39:02.779]  And they're like, oh, these things don't exist.
[00:39:03.059 --> 00:39:05.380]  There's no such thing as a no-go zone.
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.101]  You guys are making this whole story up.
[00:39:07.141 --> 00:39:08.641]  Well, what do you have to say about it now?
[00:39:08.901 --> 00:39:09.622]  It does exist.
[00:39:10.062 --> 00:39:18.525]  The fact that the three of us were out there with no weapons whatsoever, no escort, shows you the amount of danger that we were in, and the people that live in that area.
[00:39:18.545 --> 00:39:19.365]  And by the way, they shoot
[00:39:19.465 --> 00:39:21.705]  People all the time and the media hardly reports it.
[00:39:21.986 --> 00:39:26.246]  In Sweden, they order them not to report shootings and rapes if it's done by a jihadi.
[00:39:26.506 --> 00:39:31.848]  Any one of us could have been in another CIA room, a green screen room, getting our heads chopped off.
[00:39:32.368 --> 00:39:35.748]  You know, the fact that these people were screaming, chasing us in cars.
[00:39:36.348 --> 00:39:40.089]  We tried to seek refuge inside of what seemed to be like a restaurant or something.
[00:39:40.409 --> 00:39:45.050]  This guy jumps in front of Watson and grabs a door and was basically, you know, get the hell out of here.
[00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:48.371]  You know, that is a very volatile spot and these people
[00:39:49.231 --> 00:39:50.472]  It's not a religion of peace.
[00:39:50.572 --> 00:39:53.794]  And like Watson said, it's not a small number of these people.
[00:39:53.814 --> 00:39:56.035]  It's a very large amount of people.
[00:39:56.296 --> 00:40:00.238]  And there's nothing wrong with Donald Trump going, hey, let's shut this down for a second.
[00:40:00.258 --> 00:40:03.940]  Let's figure out a better way to vet this so we don't have more of these attacks.
[00:40:05.301 --> 00:40:05.842]  Incredible.
[00:40:07.639 --> 00:40:15.184]  Well, we got Tim Kennedy coming in today and that should be very, very informative because obviously he's taken out a lot of the top terrorist targets.
[00:40:15.224 --> 00:40:18.686]  That's classified, but the point is I separately have gone and researched it.
[00:40:19.226 --> 00:40:25.130]  But it's just so clear that the elite have brought these people in.
[00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:25.610]  They have.
[00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:26.130]  They've done it.
[00:40:26.491 --> 00:40:27.611]  They're letting them attack us.
[00:40:27.651 --> 00:40:28.632]  They're bringing in even more.
[00:40:28.652 --> 00:40:31.294]  And then they're going to take our freedoms when they attack.
[00:40:32.321 --> 00:40:33.342]  This is a false flag.
[00:40:33.362 --> 00:40:38.084]  I mean, is there any doubt in your mind that the establishment knows full well what they're doing, Joe?
[00:40:38.164 --> 00:40:40.245]  And where do you think they're going with this and then Paul Watson?
[00:40:40.986 --> 00:40:41.966]  Of course they know what they're doing.
[00:40:42.006 --> 00:40:44.508]  I mean, we already saw it happen in the Paris attacks.
[00:40:45.048 --> 00:40:49.330]  You know, this is stuff that's going to continue to happen if we don't do something.
[00:40:49.490 --> 00:41:01.597]  And the fact that we don't have one presidential candidate other than Trump that really has a plan to stop something like this and take a step back and look at it and reassess the situation and actually do something positive for the American people.
[00:41:02.057 --> 00:41:10.340]  You know, we already have people like Merkel and all these other folks like Hollande that are completely ignoring the fact that these people are coming into their countries and killing them.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.422]  Instead, they'd rather kiss their butts and go, okay, let's bring them in.
[00:41:13.442 --> 00:41:14.182]  Let's bring in more.
[00:41:14.202 --> 00:41:15.002]  Let's bring in more.
[00:41:15.042 --> 00:41:22.745]  And then notice again, it's that overturning of reality where Soros, Megyn Kelly, all these people come out and say Trump is stirring up ISIS.
[00:41:23.045 --> 00:41:24.726]  It's Trump's fault when they attack.
[00:41:25.046 --> 00:41:26.727]  And then when the sleeper cells activate,
[00:41:27.307 --> 00:41:31.189]  They're gonna go on the news like the Washington Post and say, arrest Trump!
[00:41:31.769 --> 00:41:42.715]  I mean, folks, think of it, and the police officers go off-duty, black police officers, you name it, and say the Trump people do nothing, and the anti-Trump people run around hitting, spitting, and attacking, and the media says it's their fault.
[00:41:43.015 --> 00:41:49.218]  Folks, this is Soros and the globalists, allied with the jihadists, communists, and every other form of filth, attacking us.
[00:41:49.478 --> 00:41:54.041]  Here's Donald Trump in January, warning of exactly what was really happening.
[00:41:54.061 --> 00:41:54.381]  Here it is.
[00:41:54.998 --> 00:42:03.037]  We do admit 100,000 Muslims on a permanent basis here every year, and this is going to be the lar- or is already the largest religion in the world.
[00:42:03.057 --> 00:42:05.002]  Can you really say let's do a temporary halt?
[00:42:06.127 --> 00:42:07.748]  There's something going on, Maria.
[00:42:08.028 --> 00:42:08.828]  Go to Brussels.
[00:42:09.188 --> 00:42:09.968]  Go to Paris.
[00:42:10.329 --> 00:42:11.629]  Go to different places.
[00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:13.350]  There's something going on.
[00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:14.470]  And it's not good.
[00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:16.151]  Where they want Sharia law.
[00:42:16.231 --> 00:42:17.111]  Where they want this.
[00:42:17.151 --> 00:42:20.512]  Where they want things that... You know, there has to be some assimilation.
[00:42:20.693 --> 00:42:21.833]  There is no assimilation.
[00:42:22.173 --> 00:42:23.714]  There's something bad going on.
[00:42:23.834 --> 00:42:27.835]  And until we find out what it is, so we can correct it... You go to Brussels.
[00:42:27.955 --> 00:42:29.836]  I was in Brussels a long time ago.
[00:42:29.856 --> 00:42:30.256]  20 years ago.
[00:42:30.616 --> 00:42:31.577]  So beautiful.
[00:42:31.637 --> 00:42:32.417]  Everything's so beautiful.
[00:42:33.206 --> 00:42:35.268]  It's like living in a hellhole right now.
[00:42:35.668 --> 00:42:38.250]  You go to these different places, there's something going on.
[00:42:47.205 --> 00:42:49.727]  And then Cruz goes, that's dumb, they're fighting ISIS.
[00:42:49.767 --> 00:42:51.728]  No, they helped put ISIS in, and Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:52.249 --> 00:42:53.570]  So Trump knows everything, folks.
[00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:54.630]  He's ready to destroy them.
[00:42:54.931 --> 00:42:59.494]  He's ready to bring out how criminals in our government, the Clintons and the Bushes, worked with the Saudis on 9-11.
[00:43:00.114 --> 00:43:01.215]  The military's awake.
[00:43:01.795 --> 00:43:07.640]  The military, as you know, Joe, four years ago said no to launching attacks to back ISIS and Al-Qaeda, to their credit.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.541]  That's got to really scare the globalists, Joe.
[00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:10.402]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:10.422 --> 00:43:17.948]  I mean, I spoke with a British couple over South by Southwest here at the event in Austin, and the wife was actually telling me how her and her husband went to the UAE.
[00:43:18.588 --> 00:43:21.431]  And when she went there, she thought about the culture.
[00:43:21.451 --> 00:43:22.111]  She goes, you know what?
[00:43:22.151 --> 00:43:22.932]  I'm not going to wear a skirt.
[00:43:23.232 --> 00:43:23.713]  I'm going to wear jeans.
[00:43:23.733 --> 00:43:25.654]  I'm going to be respectful of how they are.
[00:43:26.135 --> 00:43:31.659]  So she was walking around to the UAE, had no, you know, cleavage type, anything showing, no legs, nothing like that.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.321]  It was very respectful of the culture.
[00:43:33.761 --> 00:43:46.453]  She says now when she goes back home to London where she lives in certain areas, but she dresses the way that's part of their culture, she gets looked at, called a whore, spit at, and completely demonized because these people, like you said, are not assimilating.
[00:43:46.933 --> 00:43:50.136]  But what's amazing is they mix with this weird leftist hatred.
[00:43:50.376 --> 00:43:57.543]  They're so entitled, from what I've been told, they're worse than in their own countries now here in the West, with the left backing them and loving it.
[00:43:57.983 --> 00:43:58.904]  What sick
[00:43:59.304 --> 00:44:00.505]  Bizarre filth!
[00:44:00.805 --> 00:44:01.945]  Paul, these aren't leftists.
[00:44:02.005 --> 00:44:04.207]  What do you call these bizarro folks?
[00:44:05.067 --> 00:44:07.768]  Well, they act like fascists, so why not call them fascists?
[00:44:07.808 --> 00:44:19.094]  I mean, ISIS in its own manifesto said, you know, radical Islamists share a lot of the same beliefs as the modern progressive left, so we should start recruiting them, radicalizing them, and arming them.
[00:44:19.434 --> 00:44:23.076]  They said that in their own documents, so that's a major correlation.
[00:44:23.456 --> 00:44:24.257]  The other point is,
[00:44:25.057 --> 00:44:30.219]  You've got a lot of people on the left again saying, blaming foreign policy for terrorist acts like this.
[00:44:30.299 --> 00:44:36.042]  Well, you can argue that arming jihadists in Libya and Syria by NATO was a disastrous policy, it was.
[00:44:36.382 --> 00:44:42.265]  But then you look at Belgium specifically, okay, they were against the Iraq War from the very start.
[00:44:42.785 --> 00:44:50.913]  They suspended their bombing campaign against ISIS in Syria eight months ago, and they still got attacked by terrorists.
[00:44:51.254 --> 00:44:57.821]  So you can't use that excuse over and over again, blaming it on foreign policy, to absolve Islam of blame.
[00:44:57.841 --> 00:44:58.721]  Well, again, let's expand.
[00:44:58.762 --> 00:45:03.486]  France-backed al-Qaeda and ISIS, the number one group, it's on record, to take over Syria.
[00:45:04.227 --> 00:45:08.609]  And so ISIS is attacking France to give Hollande cover to take French freedom.
[00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:11.390]  Look, Hollande is working for ISIS.
[00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:12.530]  I'm not just saying that, folks.
[00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:15.091]  It's 100% proof we have them.
[00:45:15.131 --> 00:45:16.172]  They let them bring them in.
[00:45:16.932 --> 00:45:18.312]  They have suspended the liberties.
[00:45:18.373 --> 00:45:24.575]  Paul, is there any doubt that Hollande and Merkel are actually, I guarantee you, they're meeting with ISIS leadership.
[00:45:26.343 --> 00:45:34.193]  Well, they would rather their own citizens be killed than admit that multiculturalism is a completely failed and disastrous policy.
[00:45:34.233 --> 00:45:35.355]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:45:36.316 --> 00:45:37.277]  Yes, but they've been.
[00:45:37.518 --> 00:45:40.422]  They've been quarterbacking funding ISIS and al-Qaeda in Syria.
[00:45:40.762 --> 00:45:42.284]  They worked with Turkey to bring them in.
[00:45:42.324 --> 00:45:43.406]  It's worse than that, Paul.
[00:45:45.202 --> 00:45:47.143]  No, no, it's a complete disaster on all sides.
[00:45:47.163 --> 00:45:48.364]  No, they hate Europe!
[00:45:48.404 --> 00:45:49.445]  They want to destroy it!
[00:45:49.545 --> 00:45:49.985]  Exactly!
[00:45:50.005 --> 00:46:00.151]  I mean, even the lead singer Jesse Hughes from Eagles of Death Metal, the band that was playing at the Bataclan Theater when that horrendous attack happened, said that he thought that this was an inside job.
[00:46:00.171 --> 00:46:06.495]  The fact that he said that there were supposed to be a large amount of security that never even showed up, and only one did, and he was in the back.
[00:46:06.755 --> 00:46:07.376]  We're good to go.
[00:46:26.098 --> 00:46:26.998]  I know I'm ranting here.
[00:46:27.038 --> 00:46:27.838]  Paul Watson, come back.
[00:46:27.858 --> 00:46:28.759]  You were trying to say something.
[00:46:28.799 --> 00:46:29.719]  I'm just so angry.
[00:46:30.219 --> 00:46:34.320]  I'm so angry at these pigs like Hollande and Merkel and Obama.
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:42.462]  All anti-West, anti-freedom trash bringing in the most abusive, anti-liberty scum, anti-female scum.
[00:46:42.802 --> 00:46:47.423]  I have daughters and I'm sick of the left saying they have the moral high ground over women.
[00:46:47.603 --> 00:46:50.304]  You people hate women, you pieces of crap.
[00:46:50.684 --> 00:46:51.184]  Excuse me.
[00:46:51.484 --> 00:46:51.924]  I'm going to stop.
[00:46:51.944 --> 00:46:52.584]  It's a family show.
[00:46:52.604 --> 00:46:53.165]  I apologize.
[00:46:53.345 --> 00:46:54.785]  But I have had enough of these people.
[00:47:03.004 --> 00:47:04.006]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.547 --> 00:47:06.831]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.112 --> 00:47:14.966]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:04.946 --> 00:49:09.148]  Well, everybody knows that I celebrate humanity and I love the empowerment of humanity.
[00:49:09.328 --> 00:49:26.817]  And America's not perfect, but I love our country and I love our military because they may get sent on some good missions, some bad missions, but when it comes to the opposite of some of the leftist, anti-American, communist slugs that we see out of these anti-Trump rallies and the rest of it, there's our military and then our special forces.
[00:49:26.857 --> 00:49:27.578]  And I can't get into
[00:49:28.479 --> 00:49:47.857]  I don't even want to know and don't get to know all the special units that Tim Kennedy's part of some of the stuff he's done just know this he rewrote the Army's close quarters combat manual a few years ago and it's basically based on the training and things he's done he's been part of a lot of obviously elite military units and secret operations around the world
[00:49:48.878 --> 00:49:51.979]  And it's, you know, pretty much a Chris Kyle level career and then some.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:53.860]  But these guys don't brag in the Army.
[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:55.001]  It's okay the Navy SEALs do.
[00:49:55.021 --> 00:49:56.021]  We love them as well.
[00:49:56.521 --> 00:49:58.302]  But I tell you, Tim, so much happened.
[00:49:58.322 --> 00:50:00.723]  We had you set up for the show a while back, a few days ago.
[00:50:01.283 --> 00:50:04.064]  And then, boom, this happens this morning.
[00:50:04.105 --> 00:50:04.925]  There is so much.
[00:50:05.445 --> 00:50:05.806]  We're good
[00:50:20.282 --> 00:50:23.203]  You know, middle heavyweight fighting there at the UFC.
[00:50:23.623 --> 00:50:24.664]  So much going on.
[00:50:24.784 --> 00:50:28.805]  You're one of the co-hosts, investigators on a great show, hunting Hitler.
[00:50:29.225 --> 00:50:32.747]  And then behind the scenes, you've got all this other military career going on.
[00:50:33.047 --> 00:50:34.747]  So a very, very busy guy.
[00:50:34.827 --> 00:50:41.290]  One reason I was asking you what areas you want to get into, because a lot of it I know you obviously can't talk about, but some we will.
[00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:42.790]  So great to have you here, my friend.
[00:50:43.351 --> 00:50:43.751]  Great to have you.
[00:50:43.931 --> 00:50:44.671]  Shane here today.
[00:50:45.511 --> 00:50:47.432]  Fellow Texans, where do you want to start?
[00:50:47.532 --> 00:50:49.193]  Obviously, probably the situation in Europe.
[00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:49.973]  Yeah.
[00:50:50.934 --> 00:50:55.559]  When we talked last time, ISIS had just come out and said that they're wanting to kill me.
[00:50:55.899 --> 00:50:56.520]  They want to behead me.
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:59.123]  And the FBI came and said, hey, you're on the hit list.
[00:50:59.383 --> 00:51:02.286]  And when we talked then, I said, this isn't the beginning.
[00:51:03.407 --> 00:51:04.048]  This isn't the end.
[00:51:04.088 --> 00:51:04.748]  This is the beginning.
[00:51:05.089 --> 00:51:10.134]  From San Bernardino to Paris, Cologne, Germany, this is just the start of it.
[00:51:11.295 --> 00:51:13.476]  I think we even discussed, specifically, Belgium.
[00:51:14.116 --> 00:51:16.738]  And I said it's going to be coming to the UK, and... Yeah, we talked about it!
[00:51:16.778 --> 00:51:17.098]  We did!
[00:51:17.118 --> 00:51:21.920]  And here we are, just, you know, a few weeks later, a month later, and it's come to fruition.
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:22.621]  That's scary.
[00:51:23.341 --> 00:51:25.242]  It's nowhere near ending.
[00:51:25.482 --> 00:51:26.143]  It's just starting.
[00:51:26.343 --> 00:51:31.745]  This is the beginning of what I think is going to be a horrific change in Europe.
[00:51:32.546 --> 00:51:36.768]  And it's truly a horrific change of events.
[00:51:38.072 --> 00:51:39.253]  Let me ask you the question.
[00:51:39.333 --> 00:51:43.277]  Why do you think Merkel, Hollande would advertise to Turkey to bring these people in?
[00:51:43.357 --> 00:51:44.378]  Why are they bringing them here?
[00:51:44.738 --> 00:51:46.259]  Why are they not even checking their IDs?
[00:51:46.299 --> 00:51:47.060]  That's in the news.
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:51.244]  They won't tell governors like ours where they're going, what the numbers are.
[00:51:51.524 --> 00:51:52.425]  We've investigated.
[00:51:52.445 --> 00:51:53.806]  The report's coming out next week.
[00:51:54.447 --> 00:51:57.349]  It's 20 times what they're saying conservatively.
[00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:58.330]  What's going on?
[00:52:02.108 --> 00:52:13.093]  Conjecture can only go so far to say we know what happens when the percentage increases of the Muslims in a respective area and the corresponding terrorist attacks that go along with it.
[00:52:14.754 --> 00:52:23.078]  The Paris attacker that just got arrested last week, you know, we talk about these Muslim majorities that are saying, oh, these are bad horrific acts.
[00:52:23.518 --> 00:52:27.000]  But this guy has been living there in the open for the past month.
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:33.364]  And they know and they knew that this guy was there and they let him just live his life.
[00:52:34.104 --> 00:52:43.571]  So if we, if this is a testament, if this is an example of what can happen, so we know what happened in Paris and we know what they're capable of, and then he went back into a Muslim community and then just disappeared.
[00:52:43.631 --> 00:52:44.471]  He didn't have to hide.
[00:52:44.852 --> 00:52:50.015]  He could stay in the open and with no fear or consequence for what he did.
[00:52:50.175 --> 00:52:51.997]  No other group would support something like this.
[00:52:54.278 --> 00:52:56.020]  That is going to happen everywhere else.
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:57.021]  That's going to happen here.
[00:52:57.081 --> 00:52:57.922]  That's going to happen in the UK.
[00:52:58.063 --> 00:52:59.364]  It's going to happen again in France.
[00:52:59.404 --> 00:53:00.626]  It's going to happen again in Germany.
[00:53:00.966 --> 00:53:01.947]  This is just the beginning.
[00:53:02.828 --> 00:53:07.293]  Well, you predicted it when you were here a few months ago, specifically from your training, your background, all over the world.
[00:53:09.639 --> 00:53:09.879]  You know,
[00:53:32.438 --> 00:53:42.840]  I have no idea how the politicians can continue to escape this very clear statistic of there's X number of terrorists with this group of populists that you're bringing in.
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:57.024]  So if you have, let's just say conservatively, 10%, which is very conservative, they're saying the radicalized majority of the immigrants that are going to be brought to the US, somewhere between 20 and 30% have been radicalized, that they are fanatics and that are looking for an opportunity to execute a mission.
[00:53:58.304 --> 00:53:59.205]  So, let's just say 10%.
[00:53:59.305 --> 00:54:00.786]  That's 1 in 10, right?
[00:54:01.126 --> 00:54:08.591]  So if you're going to bring somebody over to your house for dinner, 10 people, one of which could be a terrorist, you're still going to invite them over?
[00:54:09.747 --> 00:54:10.107]  No, you're not.
[00:54:10.127 --> 00:54:10.767]  That's insane, right?
[00:54:10.787 --> 00:54:16.969]  There's not a chance you'd bring any of them at 10% at 1%, but we know that it's somewhere between 10 and 20%.
[00:54:17.929 --> 00:54:22.210]  So the current establishment is letting these people in, and they're not vetting them.
[00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:23.571]  They're welcoming them with open arms.
[00:54:24.151 --> 00:54:26.432]  There has to be a bigger picture here of why they're doing it.
[00:54:26.492 --> 00:54:27.172]  I don't know what that is.
[00:54:27.232 --> 00:54:31.273]  I can only, in my worst nightmare, imagine what's going to happen if we continue to let them in.
[00:54:31.293 --> 00:54:34.954]  It's going to be more attacks that are just going to get more and more horrific.
[00:54:35.774 --> 00:54:42.520]  Well, Germany and France have declared civil emergencies, and they've taken libertarian and nationalist groups' rights.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:46.864]  They've arrested Marie Le Pen, who is the nationalist frontrunner for president.
[00:54:47.265 --> 00:54:48.706]  She's not even as hardcore as Trump.
[00:54:48.846 --> 00:54:51.288]  She's more like a Ronald Reagan.
[00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:54.251]  And they've arrested her twice now.
[00:54:54.291 --> 00:55:00.776]  They're talking about putting her in prison for saying, we're facing the greatest threat since Nazi Germany and France from radical Muslims.
[00:55:00.836 --> 00:55:04.218]  They have arrested her and say they may disqualify her from president.
[00:55:04.258 --> 00:55:08.422]  So to me, it's pretty clear the left is allied with these jihadis and protecting them.
[00:55:09.823 --> 00:55:10.683]  I don't understand why.
[00:55:11.524 --> 00:55:16.087]  You know, that's the big question for me to seek an answer for is why?
[00:55:16.267 --> 00:55:17.048]  Why are they protecting them?
[00:55:17.068 --> 00:55:18.969]  You know, the obvious
[00:55:19.881 --> 00:55:21.322]  Implications of political correctness.
[00:55:21.362 --> 00:55:24.304]  You know, it's been driven and pounded into us for now the past 10 years.
[00:55:24.764 --> 00:55:33.490]  No, you know, I realize that you live in San Bernardino and you think that the people living next door to you look suspicious and they're dressed, they're dressing and acting like radicals.
[00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:36.612]  But no, you can't say anything because, you know, that would be racist.
[00:55:37.072 --> 00:55:38.573]  So don't say anything.
[00:55:38.693 --> 00:55:45.217]  Well, the FBI two years before was on them and got pulled off and almost charged for civil rights violation going after those very two.
[00:55:45.237 --> 00:55:47.539]  They should have got an award to be on the very two.
[00:55:47.879 --> 00:55:48.039]  Yeah.
[00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:57.245]  The opportunities to end this, we can't call it a religion anymore because when a religion then becomes a cult, the shift is clear.
[00:55:57.565 --> 00:56:02.529]  It's not an ideology of trying to peacefully appreciate some deity.
[00:56:02.829 --> 00:56:08.372]  This juncture is trying to change at a fundamental level a way of life.
[00:56:08.953 --> 00:56:10.774]  And that's our way of life, the American way of life.
[00:56:10.974 --> 00:56:13.296]  And they are going at it every single way that they can.
[00:56:13.496 --> 00:56:16.098]  If there's a form of liberty, they want it to be destroyed.
[00:56:16.518 --> 00:56:17.979]  Whether it's suicide bomb or
[00:56:19.457 --> 00:56:20.398]  Ridiculous propaganda.
[00:56:20.418 --> 00:56:36.253]  They're trying to very efficiently destroy what we view as... Well sure, some would argue, oh well we went into their countries and did all this, but then they go and attack the non-radical countries and then all these liberal countries who aren't involved at all, that's who they go attack.
[00:56:36.814 --> 00:56:40.117]  So it seems like the more you kiss their butt, the more they attack you.
[00:56:40.578 --> 00:56:41.659]  Yeah, the idea of
[00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:43.780]  Tolerance.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:52.105]  That we can just be more accepting and if we opened our doors and opened arms and hugged them and showed them and tried to appreciate their culture, that is completely moronic and idiotic.
[00:56:52.325 --> 00:56:58.549]  There is not a single ounce of support, statistically or anywhere in my experience, that would demonstrate that that makes any sense.
[00:56:58.569 --> 00:56:59.730]  Well, you've been over there constantly.
[00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:05.313]  A lot of the locals obviously invited forces trying to stabilize things and some of the wars were obviously wrong.
[00:57:05.333 --> 00:57:06.914]  I mean, I'm not defending any of that.
[00:57:07.654 --> 00:57:17.405]  I talked to Biggs who was over in Brussels right after the attacks, days after, and he said more people were angry at them for being, quote, Europeans or Westerners than he saw in Afghanistan or Iraq.
[00:57:18.006 --> 00:57:22.111]  And so he was questioning, they get more radicalized once they come into leftist countries.
[00:57:23.452 --> 00:57:24.854]  It's because it's a vacuum.
[00:57:24.894 --> 00:57:29.360]  It's an opportunity for their fanatic ideology to grow, to blossom.
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:32.343]  It's a fertile environment where they have limitless restrictions.
[00:57:32.404 --> 00:57:37.570]  So if you're in northern Iraq and you want to be part of ISIS,
[00:57:38.433 --> 00:57:40.334]  There's some pushback.
[00:57:40.394 --> 00:57:41.854]  The Kurds are going to try to kill you.
[00:57:43.895 --> 00:57:48.216]  Obviously the American forces are there in a straight up looking for an opportunity.
[00:57:48.236 --> 00:57:50.036]  A lot of the non-radical Muslims aren't naive.
[00:57:50.056 --> 00:57:51.197]  They don't want the Wahhabis around.
[00:57:51.217 --> 00:57:51.457]  Absolutely.
[00:57:51.477 --> 00:57:54.118]  Because they know bombs start dropping, drones start flying.
[00:57:54.158 --> 00:57:56.458]  They don't want those guys near them.
[00:57:56.859 --> 00:57:58.019]  But then they come to Belgium.
[00:57:58.659 --> 00:57:59.660]  And there's no drones.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:00.920]  There's no American forces.
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:02.561]  There's no, there's no Kurds.
[00:58:02.941 --> 00:58:08.964]  It's just a perfect, ripe, fertile environment for them to grow organically right there.
[00:58:10.425 --> 00:58:12.786]  These fanatic, crazy, I mean, they're crazy.
[00:58:12.826 --> 00:58:15.648]  They tried to attack Biggs and my crew and run cars into them.
[00:58:15.688 --> 00:58:16.908]  They couldn't even get in businesses.
[00:58:17.309 --> 00:58:17.929]  It was like a movie.
[00:58:17.949 --> 00:58:18.789]  They were just get out of here.
[00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:21.831]  I was, I was there last year for a USO tour in Belgium.
[00:58:22.231 --> 00:58:36.521]  And I was riding on a train and me and three other Americans were sitting there together and there was this girl that got onto the train and three Middle Eastern men kind of started maneuvering around this girl very aggressively.
[00:58:37.201 --> 00:58:41.244]  And everybody started like shifting away to not look at what was going on.
[00:58:41.804 --> 00:58:46.968]  And me and my friends were like, oh, hell no is this going to happen right in front of us.
[00:58:47.348 --> 00:58:49.449]  So we stood up and we went and sat next to the girl.
[00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:51.871]  She was shaking because she knew what was about to happen.
[00:58:53.174 --> 00:58:54.377]  That's it for the show tonight.
