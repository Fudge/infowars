[00:00:15.376 --> 00:00:17.277]  We are on the march.
[00:00:17.277 --> 00:00:20.440]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:28.426]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.426 --> 00:00:33.089]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Wednesday, November 30th, 2016.
[00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:34.871]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:38.874]  We're going to be joined in this show with many of the InfoWars reporters.
[00:00:38.874 --> 00:00:44.117]  Alex is going to have a report at the bottom of this hour, looking at yet another CNN hit piece.
[00:00:45.218 --> 00:00:48.741]  against Alex Jones and trying to attack Donald Trump.
[00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:54.124]  We're going to tell you why their news is fake news and our news is not fake news.
[00:00:54.124 --> 00:00:55.745]  We're going to analyze that.
[00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:57.206]  Alex Jones is going to do it at the bottom of the hour.
[00:00:57.206 --> 00:00:59.027]  We're going to talk about it in the next hour.
[00:00:59.027 --> 00:01:02.810]  And of course it all revolves around the charges of election fraud.
[00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.133]  So we're going to put some some rubber underneath these accusations.
[00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.994]  This is something that really needs to be examined.
[00:01:08.994 --> 00:01:14.538]  And of course as we've got Jill Stein and her failed attempt to try to
[00:01:15.678 --> 00:01:23.380]  Push back against Donald Trump for the person that she said was a criminal, Hillary Clinton, trying to get Hillary Clinton in, very selectively calling for recounts in certain areas.
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:37.044]  And as I pointed out last night on the Nightly News, this same lawyer who is working with the Hillary Clinton camp and Jill Stein had been hired by George Soros to shut down measures that would have stopped voter fraud in North Carolina.
[00:01:37.044 --> 00:01:37.844]  Voter ID.
[00:01:37.844 --> 00:01:39.165]  That is not racism.
[00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:41.065]  It is not racism to ask for photo ID.
[00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:42.806]  Everybody asks for it everywhere.
[00:01:43.656 --> 00:01:45.738]  And there's a lot of places where I don't think it should be asked for.
[00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:49.421]  But one place where I think it should be asked for is at the voting booth.
[00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:51.022]  And that is not intimidation.
[00:01:51.022 --> 00:01:54.765]  But of course, Soros used the same lawyer to try to shut that down.
[00:01:54.765 --> 00:02:05.273]  And the same lawyer is now saying that in North Carolina, where there is, I believe, last time I looked it was less than 5,000 vote difference between the Republican and Democrat for governor there.
[00:02:05.273 --> 00:02:06.014]  That is very close.
[00:02:06.014 --> 00:02:08.176]  That is something that does need to be looked at carefully.
[00:02:08.176 --> 00:02:09.357]  It does need to have a recount.
[00:02:09.357 --> 00:02:10.538]  But he says, don't do it there.
[00:02:11.178 --> 00:02:21.206]  But in the areas where there are tens of thousands of votes separating them, the kind of margins that we've never seen overturned by a recount, they want to push ahead for their own political reasons.
[00:02:21.206 --> 00:02:22.266]  And we've told you this before.
[00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:27.390]  What's behind this is to try to delegitimize the election for Donald Trump.
[00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.975]  Because that's always been a strategy of Soros and his color revolutions throughout the former Soviet Union and other places where he's done that.
[00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:40.297]  They're going to use that to inspire the social justice warrior college students to get violent on the street.
[00:02:40.297 --> 00:02:41.358]  There's two parts.
[00:02:41.358 --> 00:02:44.021]  It's an illegitimate election and this guy is an authoritarian.
[00:02:44.021 --> 00:02:53.410]  So as a result, we see the types of things that CNN is doing, trying to paint Donald Trump as a racist, trying to connect him with the Ku Klux Klan, and also doing the same thing to Alex Jones.
[00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.295]  They actually put up a picture of Alex Jones with a banner underneath it saying former KKK leader.
[00:02:59.496 --> 00:03:05.102]  I mean, that's the kind of dirty, subliminal, not even, I guess you couldn't even say that's subliminal.
[00:03:05.102 --> 00:03:07.024]  I mean, that's just overt there.
[00:03:07.024 --> 00:03:09.967]  But it's putting a message out there that is absolutely a lie.
[00:03:09.967 --> 00:03:12.850]  So Alex is going to talk about that at the bottom of the hour.
[00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.392]  But of course, we've got a lot of news today that we're talking about.
[00:03:15.392 --> 00:03:17.735]  We've had a pick for Treasury Secretary.
[00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:26.639]  Mnuchin, who has been the finance campaign manager for the Donald Trump campaign since May, I believe it was.
[00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.021]  Of course, he has connections to Goldman Sachs.
[00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:35.744]  That concerns a lot of people, but I'm going to play you some of the clips today as he announced that he's going to be Treasury Secretary.
[00:03:35.744 --> 00:03:38.205]  People talked to him about what his priorities are going to be.
[00:03:38.205 --> 00:03:43.768]  It looks like he is going right down the economic list of Donald Trump, and that's a very good thing.
[00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:47.204]  We still don't have an answer on Mitt Romney.
[00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:49.085]  We're going to look at some of these conservative picks.
[00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:52.227]  We're going to look at a little bit more detail about Tom Price.
[00:03:52.227 --> 00:03:58.792]  Politico says he's a radical conservative, and he has a radically conservative vision for American health care.
[00:03:58.792 --> 00:03:59.632]  Well, I think that's good.
[00:03:59.632 --> 00:04:03.455]  When Politico says that you're a radical conservative, that means you've got principles.
[00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:08.878]  That means that you're going to try to establish a marketplace, which again is what Donald Trump ran on.
[00:04:08.878 --> 00:04:12.261]  And we're going to talk about that, some of the news that surfaced about him also.
[00:04:12.261 --> 00:04:14.142]  We've got OPEC cutting
[00:04:15.182 --> 00:04:21.086]  They're output in a bid to try to get rid of the oversupply of oil.
[00:04:21.086 --> 00:04:22.747]  I don't think they really need to do that.
[00:04:22.747 --> 00:04:28.050]  I think what's going to happen is we're going to see a lot of economic growth if Donald Trump's economic policies go through.
[00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.032]  And we're going to tell you why that's going to happen.
[00:04:30.032 --> 00:04:37.876]  But I think they also kind of miss the idea that, you know, we had about a week or so ago, there was this massive discovery of oil in West Texas.
[00:04:37.876 --> 00:04:40.018]  They're not going to be able to control the market.
[00:04:40.578 --> 00:04:42.861]  By trying to dry up the supply of oil.
[00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:43.883]  Ain't gonna happen.
[00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:45.965]  And they're not gonna be able to do it politically either.
[00:04:45.965 --> 00:04:50.451]  Because Donald Trump is going to unleash our economic engine here in this country.
[00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:51.413]  Stay with us, we're gonna be right back.
[00:05:00.373 --> 00:05:08.018]  There's currently a war going on in this country, and it's waged against Breitbart, InfoWars, and Drudge, in large part because of Trump's victory.
[00:05:08.018 --> 00:05:13.401]  Now, the latest example of this, Apple is purging Breitbart News app from its iTunes store.
[00:05:13.401 --> 00:05:16.203]  We have an article that's up on our website written by Dan Lehman.
[00:05:16.203 --> 00:05:20.386]  This latest move, Apple has removed Breitbart News app from their iTunes marketplace.
[00:05:20.646 --> 00:05:23.809]  It's an utter censorship of free speech and truth journalism.
[00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:28.473]  They're kicking it into overdrive, despite the app being available for the past three years.
[00:05:28.473 --> 00:05:37.742]  Now, Breitbart currently ranks 28th on SimilarWeb's top 100 media sites, and they had over 168 million page views in October alone.
[00:05:37.742 --> 00:05:45.449]  But their primary target for a massive concerted effort by these globalists is to suppress and silence all opposition deemed, quote, fake news.
[00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:46.530]  Including us!
[00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:54.114]  Now, the war on Breitbart has increased because of CEO Steve Bannon, who was ultimately appointed as the White House Chief Strategist in this latest move.
[00:05:54.114 --> 00:05:56.375]  They're trying to silence all real news.
[00:05:56.375 --> 00:05:58.897]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:06:00.342 --> 00:06:02.983]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[00:06:02.983 --> 00:06:05.143]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[00:06:05.143 --> 00:06:10.864]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house.
[00:06:10.864 --> 00:06:13.965]  Like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling.
[00:06:13.965 --> 00:06:16.486]  The best part though, you can take it with you.
[00:06:16.486 --> 00:06:17.186]  It's mobile.
[00:06:17.186 --> 00:06:21.887]  To jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[00:06:22.347 --> 00:06:26.070]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity.
[00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.494]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[00:06:29.494 --> 00:06:30.514]  A true innovation.
[00:06:30.514 --> 00:06:32.616]  I have never seen anything like this.
[00:06:32.616 --> 00:06:34.318]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[00:06:34.318 --> 00:06:36.860]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.044]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[00:06:41.044 --> 00:06:43.126]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.
[00:06:43.126 --> 00:06:45.168]  That's privatepowergrid.com.

[00:07:57.672 --> 00:08:10.379]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:16.184 --> 00:08:19.580]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Wednesday, November 30th, 2016.
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:20.806]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:08:21.713 --> 00:08:25.494]  We had an interesting day yesterday, and we're going to talk about some of the things that happened there.
[00:08:25.494 --> 00:08:27.954]  And of course, we've had an interesting day already this morning.
[00:08:27.954 --> 00:08:32.695]  We've seen Donald Trump announce his pick for Treasury Secretary.
[00:08:32.695 --> 00:08:36.976]  We're going to have Roger Stone joining us in the third and fourth hour today.
[00:08:36.976 --> 00:08:41.877]  And of course, he's going to be talking a lot about the Trump transition team and the picks that we've already seen.
[00:08:41.877 --> 00:08:45.938]  I'm sure that he's going to have a lot to say about that, what we can expect to see going forward.
[00:08:46.843 --> 00:08:54.409]  We're also going to have our reporters joining us in the second hour, and we're going to be talking... Alex has a report at the bottom of the hour.
[00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:57.972]  There's another hit piece on Alex Jones on CNN yesterday.
[00:08:57.972 --> 00:08:58.933]  We're going to show you that.
[00:08:58.933 --> 00:09:07.059]  We're going to talk about their tactics, and we're also going to talk about the reality that they don't want to face, and that is that there really is voter fraud.
[00:09:07.059 --> 00:09:09.040]  Yes, there's two levels of fraud.
[00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:17.933]  There's voter fraud, where you have people who can register to vote who are not technically qualified to vote because they're not citizens.
[00:09:17.933 --> 00:09:21.355]  They're citizens of another country, not a citizen of this country.
[00:09:21.355 --> 00:09:23.596]  They haven't gone through the legal process to do that.
[00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:29.438]  You can also have people who vote multiple times because they don't need to have a voter ID.
[00:09:29.438 --> 00:09:30.779]  And of course, that happens.
[00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.180]  That happens in places like North Carolina.
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.781]  And of course, in the run-up to the election in Virginia,
[00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:41.050]  There were a large number of people that were turned in in one particular county, if you remember.
[00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:42.212]  We talked about this at the time.
[00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:49.554]  They turned in this list of people, and one of the people in the registrar's office recognized one of the names.
[00:09:49.554 --> 00:09:50.975]  She said, wait a minute.
[00:09:50.975 --> 00:09:51.495]  I know that guy.
[00:09:51.495 --> 00:09:52.296]  He just died.
[00:09:52.296 --> 00:09:55.217]  He was, I think, a judge in that county, and he just died.
[00:09:55.217 --> 00:09:58.299]  And so they turned his name in to be registered to vote.
[00:09:58.299 --> 00:10:02.221]  That's the type of thing we're going to be talking about in the second hour, the reality of voter fraud.
[00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:08.045]  But of course, there's also the reality of the even larger scheme, and that is using electronic voting.
[00:10:08.565 --> 00:10:23.659]  Removing the ability to audit the votes, which we saw the Director of Elections here in Texas do, and that's one of the things that they're trying, that they're discovering here with Jill Stein's quixotic quest to tie the system up.
[00:10:23.659 --> 00:10:26.501]  She's not really there to try to reform the system.
[00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:31.766]  She was completely silent about all these different forms of fraud before the election.
[00:10:31.766 --> 00:10:34.629]  She's got her own agenda, we understand that, and of course she's already failed.
[00:10:35.109 --> 00:10:40.993]  Because she missed the deadline in Pennsylvania by a week, according to the election officials in Pennsylvania.
[00:10:40.993 --> 00:10:43.435]  She's clueless about how this entire system works.
[00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:47.798]  She can't even read the regulations for filing her objections.
[00:10:47.798 --> 00:10:49.919]  She certainly doesn't understand the Electoral College.
[00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:51.260]  We're going to be talking about that.
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.742]  We're going to be talking about the Trump transition team.
[00:10:53.742 --> 00:10:57.925]  Before we get into that, before we talk about Mnuchin, who was picked today for Treasury Secretary,
[00:10:58.954 --> 00:11:06.523]  I think it's a very positive choice so far, even though he's got connections to Goldman Sachs, and I understand people's concerns about that.
[00:11:06.523 --> 00:11:08.225]  I think it's a very positive choice.
[00:11:08.225 --> 00:11:12.810]  When he came out and talked about this today, you could see that he was exactly on the same page with Donald Trump.
[00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:18.334]  And I think Trump understands that the economic issue is number one, front and center.
[00:11:18.334 --> 00:11:19.916]  And that economic issue is jobs.
[00:11:19.916 --> 00:11:33.308]  And so yesterday, we saw, although it began at the beginning of the day with an attack on constitutional freedoms, talking about burning flags, it ended at the end of the day with him talking about how he had saved jobs by doing a deal with Carrier.
[00:11:33.308 --> 00:11:34.169]  We're going to talk about that.
[00:11:34.169 --> 00:11:35.030]  What is that deal?
[00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.772]  We don't know the details of the deal yet.
[00:11:38.533 --> 00:11:43.965]  But, I gotta say that people looked at this and it got a lot of people upset about the flag burning thing.
[00:11:43.965 --> 00:11:48.414]  I don't like what he had to say about the flag burning thing, but I'm... and we'll talk about that, but...
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.542]  This is exactly what I thought we would see from Donald Trump.
[00:11:52.542 --> 00:11:55.644]  I thought he'd save jobs and he'd attack constitutional freedoms.
[00:11:55.644 --> 00:11:59.527]  Now, Hillary Clinton would have attacked constitutional freedoms and not saved jobs.
[00:11:59.527 --> 00:12:02.949]  She would have sent them abroad, so that's a positive thing.
[00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:06.512]  But I think it's also positive when we look at the way that he came out to attack us.
[00:12:06.512 --> 00:12:13.057]  Would you rather have somebody like Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton, whose all smiles and handshakes about the Constitution to your face,
[00:12:13.757 --> 00:12:24.120]  Who tell you that they're all for mom, apple pie, and freedom of speech, and then behind the scenes they work very diligently to shut down freedom of speech.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:31.303]  And of course we have a news item today on InfoWars.com, how Apple is purging Breitbart News from its iTunes store.
[00:12:31.303 --> 00:12:33.123]  Again, this is the fake news narrative.
[00:12:33.123 --> 00:12:35.364]  We'll be talking about that more later in the show.
[00:12:35.364 --> 00:12:41.486]  But would you rather have somebody who uses the Federal Election Commission, as they've talked about, to try to shut down free speech?
[00:12:42.066 --> 00:12:43.488]  Or to do things with the Internet.
[00:12:43.488 --> 00:12:48.514]  Accusing people of being terrorists or whatever to try to shut down the Internet.
[00:12:48.514 --> 00:12:52.238]  All the different things that Hillary Clinton and Obama would do to shut down the Internet.
[00:12:52.238 --> 00:13:00.888]  Or would you have somebody who comes out and in a very brute force insult to the First Amendment, he puts everybody on guard.
[00:13:01.525 --> 00:13:04.287]  And we get to talk about what the principles are that are involved in it.
[00:13:04.287 --> 00:13:05.848]  I think that's a more positive way to do this.
[00:13:05.848 --> 00:13:09.150]  And he has no way that he's going to get this enforced.
[00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:13.193]  So when he comes out and he talks about this, he does it in a very crude way.
[00:13:13.193 --> 00:13:16.035]  And again, it's a dog whistle to his base.
[00:13:16.035 --> 00:13:20.418]  And it's also a reflection of his past history.
[00:13:20.418 --> 00:13:20.999]  I think that
[00:13:21.579 --> 00:13:30.381]  What he was doing yesterday was he's showing his base, look, I'm going to be there for you, I'm going to get jobs, and for those of you who are with the military, who are with the police that I support, I'm going to talk about the flag.
[00:13:30.381 --> 00:13:31.882]  It just kind of came out of nowhere.
[00:13:31.882 --> 00:13:41.864]  There weren't any riots going on yesterday to start this, but in both of these cases, he is talking to his base saying, I'm going to stay with the things that you elected me to do.
[00:13:42.424 --> 00:13:48.866]  I want to look at the situation with the war on the flag first.
[00:13:48.866 --> 00:13:50.346]  Now let's talk about the jobs first.
[00:13:50.346 --> 00:13:51.167]  Let's talk about the jobs.
[00:13:51.167 --> 00:13:57.048]  Yesterday evening we had the deal with Carrier that they said was going to be announced.
[00:13:57.048 --> 00:14:08.232]  And the tweets that came out from Carrier, first they said, we are pleased to reach a deal with President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Pence to keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indianapolis.
[00:14:08.232 --> 00:14:09.352]  More details soon.
[00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:17.755]  Then President-elect Trump said, I will be going to Indiana on Thursday to make a major announcement concerning carrier air conditioning staying in Indianapolis.
[00:14:17.755 --> 00:14:19.236]  Great deal for workers.
[00:14:19.236 --> 00:14:23.318]  Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state we will keep.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.281]  Our company and jobs in the U.S.
[00:14:26.281 --> 00:14:27.701]  thanks Carrier.
[00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:30.982]  So we're going to find out what the details of that deal are.
[00:14:30.982 --> 00:14:39.405]  But remember, on Thanksgiving Day, Donald Trump said, hey, I'm working even on Thanksgiving Day to get Carrier to keep their facility in the United States.
[00:14:40.305 --> 00:14:41.306]  And I think that's amazing.
[00:14:56.803 --> 00:15:00.184]  Very positive signs, while he's not even elected president.
[00:15:00.184 --> 00:15:09.327]  He's hit the ground running already, doing things like this as his treasury pick, Mnuchin, said, I haven't seen a president do that for a very long time.
[00:15:09.327 --> 00:15:12.748]  I can't remember a president trying to keep jobs in America.
[00:15:12.748 --> 00:15:14.109]  Not in my lifetime.
[00:15:14.109 --> 00:15:20.791]  I don't think Mnuchin's any older than I am, but I haven't ever seen a president try to do anything to keep jobs in this country.
[00:15:21.491 --> 00:15:27.927]  Since Richard Nixon, we have had presidents who have been campaigning to take jobs out of this country.
[00:15:28.609 --> 00:15:35.651]  I mean, that's been the reality of what's behind this opening to China with Kissinger, the NAFTA trade deals, the trade deals with China.
[00:15:35.651 --> 00:15:42.854]  They have been working very hard to get jobs out of this country, to get foreign workers into this country to take your jobs.
[00:15:42.854 --> 00:15:44.754]  That's been what we have seen before.
[00:15:44.754 --> 00:15:50.356]  So, the fact that he hit the ground running with this, the fact that he has been successful, I think that's very important.
[00:15:50.356 --> 00:15:51.496]  What kind of a deal did he do?
[00:15:51.496 --> 00:15:52.717]  I hope it's not a situation
[00:15:53.464 --> 00:15:57.747]  Where he is giving them financial incentives, crony capitalism, to stay here.
[00:15:57.747 --> 00:16:02.269]  We've seen this with Elon Musk, getting billions of dollars, many cases.
[00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:16.598]  Typically the way this works out on state levels, these guys get so much in terms of tax benefits and subsidies and other things, that it works out costing the taxpayer hundreds of thousands of dollars for every job that is theoretically created.
[00:16:16.598 --> 00:16:18.139]  I hope that's not the situation here.
[00:16:18.139 --> 00:16:20.321]  I hope that he picked up the phone with them and said, look,
[00:16:21.121 --> 00:16:29.187]  We're going to set up a situation where we're going to not have favorable tariffs for people who manufacture outside of our country.
[00:16:29.187 --> 00:16:33.510]  And oh, by the way, there's this other thing that's happening throughout the world.
[00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:46.639]  Back in the middle of September, if you remember, Obama and John Kerry went to Rwanda and they signed an agreement with most of the other countries of the world saying they're going to get rid of air conditioning coolant.
[00:16:47.816 --> 00:16:52.218]  I told my sons at the time that happened, I said, hey guys, be ready to live in a world without air conditioning.
[00:16:52.218 --> 00:16:57.221]  And my sons Lance said, from my cold dead hands.
[00:16:57.221 --> 00:16:57.701]  Exactly.
[00:16:57.701 --> 00:16:59.222]  But that's what they want to do.
[00:16:59.222 --> 00:17:11.928]  They want to shut down all Freon forms, all coolants, and understand that what's really behind this is that there's a couple of people with connections to government here in America
[00:17:12.648 --> 00:17:13.129]  We're good to go.
[00:17:30.111 --> 00:17:34.494]  Today we see in California they're seriously going to try to regulate cow farts.
[00:17:34.494 --> 00:17:39.277]  So it's not as strange as things look.
[00:17:39.277 --> 00:17:41.119]  Reality gets even stranger.
[00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:45.502]  But I hope he explained to them that it's going to be in their interest that they can manufacture
[00:17:46.869 --> 00:17:47.329]  We're good to go.
[00:18:07.984 --> 00:18:11.431]  He's also going to put some taxes on as it passes across the border.
[00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:13.975]  So hopefully it was done in that kind of vein.
[00:18:13.975 --> 00:18:15.939]  Hopefully it is not a crony capitalism thing.
[00:18:15.939 --> 00:18:17.221]  But let's talk about the flag issue.
[00:18:17.867 --> 00:18:20.509]  Because Donald Trump has been in flag wars before.
[00:18:20.509 --> 00:18:24.372]  Remember the flag war that he had in Palm Beach County?
[00:18:24.372 --> 00:18:28.535]  And this was something I went back into the Wayback Machine flashback.
[00:18:28.535 --> 00:18:30.396]  This is a Politico article about it.
[00:18:30.396 --> 00:18:33.898]  They're talking about the regulatory environment there in Palm Beach.
[00:18:33.898 --> 00:18:37.421]  They said, first you need to know Palm Beach is a town where measurements matter.
[00:18:37.421 --> 00:18:43.365]  Leaf blowers require inspectors to verify that they emit no more than 65 decibels from 50 feet away.
[00:18:43.365 --> 00:18:45.427]  They regulate the amount of noise of leaf blowers.
[00:18:46.207 --> 00:18:58.025]  They hold people who are having garage sales are restricted to one sign that could be no more than four square feet in size and residents who are flying flags on their property are restricted to flagpoles no higher than 42 feet.
[00:18:58.025 --> 00:19:00.889]  Flags that are a maximum of four feet by six feet.
[00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:03.811]  That's the kind of regulations that they have.
[00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:12.453]  He was fined $5,000 because he replaced a section of dead hedges with new hedges that were alive, but they weren't quite tall enough.
[00:19:12.453 --> 00:19:15.134]  So the town of Palm Beach put that on him.
[00:19:15.134 --> 00:19:18.295]  I mean, why would you want to live in a place like that?
[00:19:18.295 --> 00:19:19.676]  But I'm sure that got under his skin.
[00:19:20.236 --> 00:19:24.140]  And that's a great thing, when you've got a president who has seen excessive regulation.
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.943]  I think it's one of the reasons why he tweeted out, I'm going to get rid of about 70% of the regulations.
[00:19:27.943 --> 00:19:29.545]  I don't know.
[00:19:29.545 --> 00:19:34.630]  To put a number on it like that, he doesn't have an exact number, but there is a lot to be cut there.
[00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.493]  So we're going to talk about his war in support of the flag.
[00:19:37.833 --> 00:19:40.834]  We're going to talk about the story that's on Infowars.com.
[00:19:40.834 --> 00:19:45.736]  A Navy home, a Navy vet's home was vandalized and torched by anti-Trump extremists.
[00:19:45.736 --> 00:19:51.058]  And then we're going to talk about this burning of the American flag and where that fits in free speech.
[00:19:51.058 --> 00:19:51.978]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:20:00.618 --> 00:20:02.399]  KD Armor raised the standard.
[00:20:02.399 --> 00:20:07.881]  Finally, AR500 steel core body armor that comfortably conforms to the chest and torso.

[00:21:04.693 --> 00:21:06.155]  I have a confession to make.
[00:21:06.155 --> 00:21:10.080]  I spent years unable to think clearly, like I was in a fog.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:14.906]  I was going through the motions, running my companies, and I hated feeling mentally sluggish.
[00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:16.248]  I couldn't get ahead like this.
[00:21:16.989 --> 00:21:20.491]  It's no secret, the powers that be want us dumbed down.
[00:21:20.491 --> 00:21:26.553]  Chemicals, fluoride, our brains are under siege and we are experiencing lower IQs.
[00:21:26.553 --> 00:21:29.694]  But now there is a weapon to fight back and win.

[00:21:43.724 --> 00:21:47.367]  It feels great to get things done again and get ahead.

[00:24:16.523 --> 00:24:19.186]  I want to get back to this issue of flag burning.
[00:24:19.186 --> 00:24:24.493]  As I said yesterday, we saw exactly what I expected to see from Donald Trump.
[00:24:25.334 --> 00:24:32.519]  Jobs being saved here in America even before he becomes president and again another attack against some constitutional freedoms.
[00:24:32.519 --> 00:24:37.822]  And I want to tell you that this is part of a struggle that he's been working with a long time.
[00:24:37.822 --> 00:24:42.625]  I want to talk about his fight with Palm Beach on trying to fly the flag there.
[00:24:42.625 --> 00:24:46.387]  And of course that was a fight where he was definitely on the right side.
[00:24:46.387 --> 00:24:50.149]  They were trying to shut down his free expression in terms of flying that flag.
[00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:54.292]  We're also going to talk about a Navy vet whose home was vandalized and torched.
[00:24:55.134 --> 00:24:56.416]  By anti-Trump extremists.
[00:24:56.416 --> 00:25:00.885]  So they didn't, you know, you want to talk about people burning flags and then getting attacked.
[00:25:00.885 --> 00:25:03.790]  Well, he put up a sign and they burned his home.
[00:25:04.645 --> 00:25:06.366]  So let's put some things in perspective.
[00:25:06.366 --> 00:25:10.209]  We're going to talk about the principles involved here and how this is playing out.
[00:25:10.209 --> 00:25:15.314]  Before we do, real quickly, I just want to let you know that we've got some extended sales that are going to be ending today.
[00:25:15.314 --> 00:25:20.618]  This is the last day of these sales that have been extended from Black Friday.
[00:25:20.618 --> 00:25:26.743]  We've extended the Black Friday sale 30 to 40 percent off InfoWars Select Storable Food at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:25:26.743 --> 00:25:28.124]  That is a huge savings.
[00:25:28.904 --> 00:25:33.486]  30 to 40 percent off are already very competitive price on storable foods.
[00:25:33.486 --> 00:25:50.071]  These are going to last for 25 years, all made in the USA, all non-GMO, all packaged in a kind of packaging as you can see at the website, very high quality packaging and even ziplock seal so that when you finally break that seal you can reseal it for short-term preservation there as well.
[00:25:50.071 --> 00:25:51.832]  Also, when you go to Infowarslife.com,
[00:25:53.232 --> 00:25:57.434]  We also have a couple of supplements that have been put on a massive discount.
[00:25:57.434 --> 00:26:02.076]  30% off Supermail Vitality and Silver Bullet, 50% off.
[00:26:02.076 --> 00:26:04.397]  Both of those are at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:26:04.397 --> 00:26:06.497]  Both of those are going to end today.
[00:26:06.497 --> 00:26:10.779]  Today is the final sale for those three things actually.
[00:26:10.779 --> 00:26:12.620]  Supermail Vitality, 30% off.
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.240]  Silver Bullet, 50% off.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.902]  And 30 to 40% off InfoWars Select Storable Food.
[00:26:18.902 --> 00:26:20.303]  Now as I was pointing out before we went to the break,
[00:26:21.351 --> 00:26:24.652]  In Palm Beach, highly regulated industry.
[00:26:24.652 --> 00:26:27.993]  And that's a good thing for a president to be fighting back against that.
[00:26:27.993 --> 00:26:29.033]  And that's what he did.
[00:26:29.033 --> 00:26:31.674]  And he fought against them on the flag issue.
[00:26:31.674 --> 00:26:37.175]  He had been penalized by them $5,000 as a point out for cutting down a dead hedge and then putting up one that was alive.
[00:26:37.175 --> 00:26:38.776]  And they said, well, it's not as high as it was before.
[00:26:38.776 --> 00:26:39.536]  So here's a $5,000 fine.
[00:26:39.536 --> 00:26:42.077]  Can you imagine living somewhere like that?
[00:26:42.958 --> 00:26:51.580]  And then they regulate everything from the amount of noise that your leaf blower has to the size that your garage sale sign can be, and of course the height and the size of your flag.
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:52.961]  Well, he completely ignored that.
[00:26:52.961 --> 00:26:58.362]  He put up an 80-foot flagpole on the front lawn of Mar-a-Lago.
[00:26:58.362 --> 00:27:03.784]  They said he had a car dealership-sized American flag 15 feet by 25 feet flying from it.
[00:27:03.784 --> 00:27:06.385]  And he knew what he was doing, says Politico, and he did.
[00:27:06.385 --> 00:27:07.485]  It was a protest, okay?
[00:27:08.433 --> 00:27:14.699]  Trump had been fighting with the town Poobahs from the very moment he got there, as they point out on Politico, and he was plainly inviting a lawsuit.
[00:27:14.699 --> 00:27:16.621]  And Trump said this.
[00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:27.131]  He went on Nancy Grace's show and said, the town council of Palm Beach should be ashamed of itself for putting regulations and fining me for putting up the American flag.
[00:27:27.131 --> 00:27:29.153]  This is probably a first in the U.S.
[00:27:29.153 --> 00:27:29.474]  history.
[00:27:30.225 --> 00:27:39.475]  They started fining him several hundred dollars a day, the fine grew to $120,000 and then he filed a lawsuit against Palm Beach asking for $25 million in damages.
[00:27:39.475 --> 00:27:45.482]  Let me say this, I've lived in some places where there are a lot of regulations on signs and other things in North Carolina, but
[00:27:46.348 --> 00:27:50.350]  They always made exceptions for flags, especially for the American flag.
[00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:57.855]  Some places would exempt all flags, but pretty much all of them in North Carolina would exempt the American flag.
[00:27:57.855 --> 00:28:04.959]  That's why you see it flying so much at car dealerships, because it gets attention and it gets around the regulations on their own signs.
[00:28:06.056 --> 00:28:10.740]  But you know, flying a flag is political speech, and he exercised that, and he prevailed.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:24.771]  They essentially did a deal, as Donald Trump does, they waived $120,000 worth of fines that they had done, and he agreed to give $100,000 to veterans charities, and it worked out.
[00:28:24.771 --> 00:28:26.372]  And he made his point.
[00:28:26.372 --> 00:28:28.854]  And that's the whole point that we're looking at here.
[00:28:28.854 --> 00:28:29.674]  You have to understand,
[00:28:30.535 --> 00:28:41.387]  That when we talk about the flag, and if you say that it is a symbol of our Constitution, a symbol of the free speech that you fought for, I agree.
[00:28:41.387 --> 00:28:47.013]  But we have to not destroy the thing itself in order to protect the symbol of the thing.
[00:28:47.013 --> 00:28:47.814]  Do you understand?
[00:28:48.885 --> 00:28:52.210]  The real thing is free political speech.
[00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:54.674]  And burning a flag is political speech.
[00:28:54.674 --> 00:28:56.537]  Justice Scalia said that as well.
[00:28:56.537 --> 00:29:00.423]  And so we know that when you put that out there,
[00:29:01.363 --> 00:29:03.984]  We don't want somebody getting their home burned because of their political speech.
[00:29:03.984 --> 00:29:08.566]  We don't want somebody getting attacked because they're wearing a Donald Trump hat.
[00:29:08.566 --> 00:29:10.967]  Or getting their car destroyed at a rally.
[00:29:10.967 --> 00:29:12.707]  We don't want to see that happening.
[00:29:12.707 --> 00:29:18.069]  And we don't want to see threats from people like Joe Manchin saying, yeah you can burn a flag but then I'm going to punch you out.
[00:29:18.069 --> 00:29:20.990]  Or Donald Trump saying we're going to take your citizenship or put you in jail.
[00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:22.191]  That isn't going to happen.
[00:29:22.191 --> 00:29:25.152]  It's good that we can have that kind of discussion though.
[00:29:25.712 --> 00:29:27.673]  And I'm glad that it is a frontal attack.
[00:29:27.673 --> 00:29:29.194]  I understand the other people would have done that as well.
[00:29:29.194 --> 00:29:36.577]  When we come back from the break, Alex Jones is going to talk about the latest attack from CNN, trying to paint us as fake news.
[00:29:36.577 --> 00:29:39.779]  No, their news is fake about voter fraud.
[00:29:39.779 --> 00:29:42.320]  He'll be right back with us, right at the bottom after we come back from break.
[00:29:49.798 --> 00:29:53.726]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.726 --> 00:29:56.411]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.626 --> 00:30:15.776]  In yet another disgusting example of the crimes committed against Trump supporters, we have an article that's up on our website, written by Paul Joseph Watson, entitled, Now, I'm talking about a Navy veteran with two young children at home.
[00:30:15.776 --> 00:30:21.780]  His house was vandalized with anti-Trump graffiti and racial slurs, both inside and out, before they torched the place.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:27.721]  And yet another shocking example of anti-Trump hate crimes sweeping the country since we've seen Trump's victory.
[00:30:27.721 --> 00:30:35.664]  Now, the veteran Matthew Smith, who flies three flags in front of his house in Plant City, Florida, which are the American flag, the POW flag, and the U.S.
[00:30:35.664 --> 00:30:39.244]  Navy flag, says that he was targeted for his, quote, political beliefs.
[00:30:39.244 --> 00:30:41.265]  We should be figuring out our problems together.
[00:30:41.425 --> 00:30:49.895]  Now the word cracker was spray-painted in his house, and this suggests that the crime was racially motivated, most likely carried out by Black Lives Matter supporters.
[00:30:49.895 --> 00:30:56.904]  To make matters worse, Smith's home is in foreclosure, and they have no insurance to cover the belongings that were utterly destroyed in this fire.
[00:30:56.904 --> 00:30:59.627]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:31:00.248 --> 00:31:01.068]  Hey, everyone!
[00:31:01.068 --> 00:31:07.190]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:09.271]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:31:09.271 --> 00:31:19.554]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:31:19.554 --> 00:31:25.536]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:31:25.996 --> 00:31:46.753]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work, you need to check out InfoWarsTeam.com.

[00:31:57.922 --> 00:32:03.206]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[00:32:03.206 --> 00:32:07.310]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:09.952]  Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[00:32:09.952 --> 00:32:12.774]  I'm Charlie Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[00:32:12.774 --> 00:32:17.979]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:24.726]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[00:32:24.726 --> 00:32:30.994]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[00:32:30.994 --> 00:32:33.577]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[00:32:33.937 --> 00:32:35.097]  We're the solution!
[00:32:35.097 --> 00:32:36.037]  Americans!
[00:32:36.037 --> 00:32:37.598]  Ain't nothing more to it than that!
[00:32:37.598 --> 00:32:42.999]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[00:32:42.999 --> 00:32:44.819]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[00:32:44.819 --> 00:32:46.239]  DVDs now available.
[00:32:46.239 --> 00:32:50.160]  Want to shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:55.761]  RevelationTheMovie.info Americans need to see this film.
[00:32:55.761 --> 00:32:59.282]  RevelationTheMovie.info Let's fix it.
[00:33:05.959 --> 00:33:07.784]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:07.784 --> 00:33:12.156]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:19.972 --> 00:33:21.352]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.352 --> 00:33:22.233]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:33:22.233 --> 00:33:33.176]  We're going to have Alex pushing back against the CNN attack on him yesterday, but of course we have another article on Infowars.com today showing how this is stacking up.
[00:33:33.176 --> 00:33:37.257]  Apple has purged Breitbart News' app from the iTunes Store.
[00:33:38.237 --> 00:33:42.058]  See, everywhere we look, we're seeing this kind of censorship.
[00:33:42.058 --> 00:33:43.339]  This is the pushback.
[00:33:43.339 --> 00:33:48.141]  They're using the fake news, the hoax news, labeling Breitbart, labeling InfoWars.
[00:33:48.141 --> 00:33:56.204]  Is that because they've pushed out the conspiracy theory for so long, calling people that, that it hasn't worked, so they've got to come up with a new term?
[00:33:56.204 --> 00:34:05.067]  That was something, of course, that if you question the official story, going back to JFK, we had the FBI, CIA government coming out saying, oh, they're conspiracy theorists.
[00:34:05.067 --> 00:34:07.068]  I don't believe that one guy
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:13.123]  With a gun could get all those different angles on the president.
[00:34:13.123 --> 00:34:15.004]  But we have this magic bullet theory.
[00:34:15.004 --> 00:34:17.786]  And forget the witnesses that were there that heard shots from the front.
[00:34:17.786 --> 00:34:18.907]  Forget the Zapruder film.
[00:34:18.907 --> 00:34:19.727]  Forget all that stuff.
[00:34:19.727 --> 00:34:21.328]  If you do that, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:34:21.328 --> 00:34:25.351]  They have used that to gaslight people for 60 years, is it now?
[00:34:25.351 --> 00:34:27.532]  Let's say it was 50 years, I think.
[00:34:27.532 --> 00:34:29.533]  So it's about 53 years, I think.
[00:34:30.894 --> 00:34:31.514]  So they've used that.
[00:34:31.514 --> 00:34:32.155]  It's getting old.
[00:34:32.155 --> 00:34:33.415]  It really got old this last time.
[00:34:33.415 --> 00:34:34.836]  So now they're going into fake news.
[00:34:34.836 --> 00:34:37.157]  Now they are purging news.
[00:34:37.157 --> 00:34:40.319]  And of course, Apple setting up their own news filters.
[00:34:40.319 --> 00:34:42.720]  Facebook setting up their own news filters.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.442]  That is a very important but very subtle attack.
[00:34:45.442 --> 00:34:51.265]  But there's a more open attack on free speech and on the news outlets that really did carry the day.
[00:34:52.529 --> 00:34:58.695]  Like Infowars, like Breitbart, and that's what we're going to play for you coming up from Alex in just one moment.
[00:34:58.695 --> 00:35:02.879]  One of the things I think is important, there's also some breaking news.
[00:35:02.879 --> 00:35:05.741]  I just asked the guys during the break if they'd had the vote for Pelosi.
[00:35:05.741 --> 00:35:11.867]  It looked like they were going to have their own transition team with the Democrats as well, but it looks like she won that and is going to remain.
[00:35:13.068 --> 00:35:29.575]  As a minority leader in the House, when we look at the pushback on Donald Trump in terms of trying to divest himself of business stuff, everybody forgets how Nancy Pelosi used all these different issues to ingratiate herself.
[00:35:29.575 --> 00:35:30.716]  But we're going to talk about that more.
[00:35:30.716 --> 00:35:35.238]  Let's go to Alex talking about the CNN report that aired last night.
[00:35:36.872 --> 00:35:40.815]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:35:40.815 --> 00:35:42.176]  I will not let you down.
[00:35:42.176 --> 00:35:45.778]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:35:45.778 --> 00:35:59.108]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot... Donald Trump and Alex Jones, the conservative conspiracy theorist and operator of the website InfoWars, which seems to be a place where Trump gets a lot of his information.
[00:35:59.648 --> 00:36:10.594]  Jones can take credit for spearheading some of the most outrageous theories on the internet, from claims that 9-11 was a government conspiracy to the Sandy Hook shooting being faked.
[00:36:10.594 --> 00:36:18.898]  Jones' theories reach tens of millions each month and are now often echoed by the next president of the United States.
[00:36:18.898 --> 00:36:20.939]  The controlled corporate fake press.
[00:36:22.344 --> 00:36:31.947]  After losing the election three weeks ago, has only massively intensified their deception campaign against the American people.
[00:36:31.947 --> 00:36:41.870]  They are now censoring Infowars.com, GrudgeReport.com out of major libraries, out of Wi-Fi being provided across the country and the world.
[00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:46.511]  They're putting out fake news lists, and then those sites are being delisted.
[00:36:47.981 --> 00:36:54.945]  Breitbart had its app just deleted out of the iTunes store.
[00:36:54.945 --> 00:36:57.386]  We've had things like that done to us as well.
[00:36:57.386 --> 00:37:00.468]  This is unprecedented what's taking place.
[00:37:00.468 --> 00:37:17.257]  Now, I started getting calls yesterday afternoon when I was driving home at about 6, with people saying, yeah, they just flashed it up on TV, coming up, the man that Donald Trump gets his info from, and they said it said under it, KKK leader in the promos.
[00:37:19.232 --> 00:37:23.654]  But by the time the show actually came on, they weren't showing the KKK leader garbage.
[00:37:23.654 --> 00:37:25.475]  But here's why this is important.
[00:37:25.475 --> 00:37:29.577]  It's done not subliminally, but in plain view.
[00:37:29.577 --> 00:37:31.498]  So I call it kind of quasi-subliminal.
[00:37:31.498 --> 00:37:35.440]  It's just total yellow journalism on multiple levels.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:40.683]  It says former KKK leader endorses Stephen Bannon.
[00:37:41.972 --> 00:37:50.597]  And then it's under me, under Alex Jones, under my face from a video about a completely separate subject.
[00:37:50.597 --> 00:37:54.339]  And then they pop up the name Alex Jones under it.
[00:37:54.339 --> 00:37:59.462]  So if you're a TV viewer, we're showing you that right now.
[00:37:59.462 --> 00:38:02.403]  So this is how they deceive.
[00:38:02.403 --> 00:38:04.144]  This is how they manipulate.
[00:38:04.144 --> 00:38:04.705]  This is how
[00:38:06.598 --> 00:38:09.519]  Stupid, they think their readers, their viewers are.
[00:38:09.519 --> 00:38:12.460]  I mean, this is unprecedented.
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:20.282]  The one other time I saw him do something like this was Fox and it was Bill O'Reilly talking about sexual predators online and then cut to a video of him yelling about corrupt government.
[00:38:20.282 --> 00:38:22.143]  Had nothing to do with it, with my face turning red.
[00:38:22.583 --> 00:38:28.968]  You know what it's like to go to sleep every night knowing you work for a bunch of psychotic killers and you bastards are probably gonna end up killing me one day!
[00:38:28.968 --> 00:38:30.109]  Hate speech.
[00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:34.012]  Now Facebook is apologizing for allowing it worldwide.
[00:38:34.012 --> 00:38:36.614]  But can anything be done to stop the hatred?
[00:38:36.614 --> 00:38:40.778]  Which is directly linked into the IRS Tea Party scandal.
[00:38:40.778 --> 00:38:44.321]  Facebook having a terrible problem with that and recently hatred against women.
[00:38:44.861 --> 00:38:45.242]  So it's just...
[00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:04.211]  Say the word child molester, it shows somebody's face.
[00:39:04.211 --> 00:39:06.652]  Or say the word KKK, it shows somebody's face.
[00:39:06.652 --> 00:39:10.473]  It is the lowest level of just baseless disinfo.
[00:39:10.473 --> 00:39:22.298]  And again, I say it's almost subliminal because you're just there watching the news and you see Alex Jones's face and then it says KKK leader and then it says Alex Jones promoing something that's coming up.
[00:39:22.298 --> 00:39:27.580]  It's just all done to mix it together and to deceive people in a massive way.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:31.041]  Now, I've got to be honest with the viewers and listeners, I've kind of gotten punched
[00:39:33.029 --> 00:39:33.309]  I don't know.
[00:39:56.019 --> 00:40:04.186]  All the thinking people, every race, color, and creed now understand this media is foreign owned, globalist run, out to get us.
[00:40:04.186 --> 00:40:10.370]  They see the Pope lecturing us and telling us what we should do and the communist Chinese and the Saudi Arabians and everybody else.
[00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:11.151]  And they see through it.
[00:40:11.151 --> 00:40:21.559]  But truly, the reason they're trying to derail what Trump is doing and calling it racist and demonizing it is because it will end their global system.
[00:40:21.559 --> 00:40:25.042]  If America is allowed to operate outside of globalism and is prosperous,
[00:40:26.155 --> 00:40:26.475]  I think?
[00:40:48.402 --> 00:40:49.503]  That's why it's so powerful.
[00:40:49.503 --> 00:40:53.588]  It's not just some ideology he went and made up somewhere.
[00:40:53.588 --> 00:40:58.675]  So when the media sits there at Reddit or the New York Times and says, what is globalism?
[00:40:58.675 --> 00:40:59.776]  Does it exist?
[00:40:59.776 --> 00:41:00.076]  No!
[00:41:01.491 --> 00:41:05.353]  It's like telling a child that A, B, C, D, E, F, G doesn't exist.
[00:41:05.353 --> 00:41:09.515]  It's like saying that George Washington didn't exist.
[00:41:09.515 --> 00:41:19.060]  But that's the level of deception and just waging war on reality that they're involved in because they are at war with reality.
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:28.084]  Because what they're selling, authoritarianism, as some neoliberal wonderful cosmology, is so ridiculous no one wants to buy it.
[00:41:28.084 --> 00:41:30.646]  Freedom and free association is like the greatest gourmet
[00:41:40.402 --> 00:41:40.722]  I think so.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:15.544]  24-7 attacking Stephen Bannon and yours truly, Alex Jones, tells you something.
[00:42:15.544 --> 00:42:24.092]  They know Stephen Bannon is a patriot and an anti-globalist and wants to launch a plan to make even the poorest people wealthy in comparison to other nations.
[00:42:24.092 --> 00:42:25.073]  He's openly said that.
[00:42:25.073 --> 00:42:26.114]  That is their plan.
[00:42:26.114 --> 00:42:27.796]  Carrier air conditioning is already coming back.
[00:42:27.796 --> 00:42:28.696]  Ford's already coming back.
[00:42:28.696 --> 00:42:31.079]  Apple says they may come back before he's even in office.
[00:42:32.489 --> 00:42:39.073]  And they're attacking yours truly because if they can get Trump to cut away from his base, it's not just crippling Trump.
[00:42:39.073 --> 00:42:51.261]  It will cut him off from Americana, which they're trying to dub as racist and evil for us to have level playing fields and control borders and basic sovereignty.
[00:42:51.261 --> 00:42:56.825]  So Trump is purposely invoking nationalism and red meat stuff like don't burn the American flag.
[00:42:57.867 --> 00:43:07.593]  To force the left to then begin defending free speech, something they've actually been attacking, something they're coming out and bulldozing.
[00:43:07.593 --> 00:43:12.757]  They want to yell about free speech, burning the flag all day, and I agree, you have a right to do it, even though I don't like it.
[00:43:12.757 --> 00:43:18.020]  But they're the ones banning stuff off Facebook, off Twitter, the Apple purges.
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:19.241]  Some people say, oh, that's Apple's
[00:43:19.241 --> 00:43:19.541]  I think?
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.442]  Refused to sell at Google Store, and they shut our store down.
[00:43:44.442 --> 00:43:46.484]  That was an article that happened a few years ago.
[00:43:46.484 --> 00:43:49.486]  I guess seven years ago now.
[00:43:49.486 --> 00:43:52.728]  And it just banned us and said, this is a racist film.
[00:43:52.728 --> 00:43:58.473]  We are not allowing you to sell it or have an Apple or a Google Store.
[00:43:58.473 --> 00:44:00.074]  So this is what they're doing, folks.
[00:44:00.074 --> 00:44:02.996]  This is serious censorship.
[00:44:02.996 --> 00:44:06.559]  And they're throwing it in everybody's face while saying they're, quote, the liberals.
[00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:09.672]  They're doing this because they're desperate.
[00:44:09.672 --> 00:44:21.445]  They're doing this because the ideas that I promote and that Stephen Bannon and others promote is poison to these people and will bring their system down.
[00:44:21.445 --> 00:44:23.967]  So for the new viewers and new listeners, this is not my opinion.
[00:44:23.967 --> 00:44:29.393]  The things we're talking about here are admitted by the enemy, by the globalists in their own publications and documents.
[00:44:30.345 --> 00:44:38.552]  And once we identify the globalists and their globalist system, and get the public to actually go read and research what's really happening, it's game over for them.
[00:44:38.552 --> 00:44:43.096]  So, some family and others say, how am I taking it with these new levels of perception?
[00:44:43.096 --> 00:44:44.817]  I'm taking it fine.
[00:44:44.817 --> 00:44:47.159]  It means I'm having an effect.
[00:44:47.159 --> 00:44:50.042]  It means the great crew at Infowars is having an effect.
[00:44:50.042 --> 00:44:54.345]  It means the listeners of this radio show and TV show are spreading the word, taking action.
[00:44:54.345 --> 00:44:56.067]  But do not take any of this for granted.
[00:44:56.767 --> 00:45:02.951]  They are trying to shut us down and they can shut down Breitbart or Drudge or Infowars if they can get any one of those.
[00:45:02.951 --> 00:45:06.573]  They set the precedent to take everything else out and they were on the verge.
[00:45:06.573 --> 00:45:11.096]  They handed over the internet to the UN and a multinational consortium.
[00:45:11.096 --> 00:45:15.198]  They were about to get five Supreme Court justices, at least four.
[00:45:15.198 --> 00:45:16.479]  They were imploding everything.
[00:45:16.479 --> 00:45:18.020]  The borders are already completely lowered.
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:19.460]  The drones were turned off.
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:22.983]  They were already telling us that jihadis were going to be put in every town and every city.
[00:45:24.306 --> 00:45:26.549]  They're that close to finishing their operation.
[00:45:26.549 --> 00:45:29.072]  Let's just pray Trump's for real.
[00:45:29.072 --> 00:45:38.523]  Because in a modern sense, he is our best and only hope for rectifying this in a peaceful manner.
[00:45:38.523 --> 00:45:41.026]  Because let me tell you something, the globals are not going to be peaceful next phase.
[00:45:41.847 --> 00:45:43.068]  They're not going to co-exist with us.
[00:45:43.068 --> 00:45:47.271]  They cannot co-exist with a free market, open, true liberal society.
[00:45:47.271 --> 00:45:53.155]  Jones posted this video entitled an emergency message to Donald Trump during the campaign.
[00:45:53.155 --> 00:46:06.163]  I am going to ask you to seriously think about making the issue of Hillary's election fraud in the primaries one of the central issues to defeating her in November.
[00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:08.845]  Trump had this to say a day later.
[00:46:08.845 --> 00:46:10.566]  I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged.
[00:46:10.566 --> 00:46:11.287]  I have to be honest.
[00:46:12.107 --> 00:46:14.848]  Because I think my side was rigged.
[00:46:14.848 --> 00:46:22.651]  And in the wake of the election, Jones pushing a theory that despite the vote totals, Trump actually won the popular vote.
[00:46:22.651 --> 00:46:24.292]  Millions of illegals voting.
[00:46:24.292 --> 00:46:26.693]  At least five states being stolen for Hillary.
[00:46:27.691 --> 00:46:35.894]  We're talking 5, 6, 7, 8 million people more voting for Trump, if you look at the evidence, in the popular vote than did.
[00:46:35.894 --> 00:46:48.159]  And Trump, tweeting just four days later, quote, in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.
[00:46:48.159 --> 00:46:49.640]  I'll tell you, it is surreal.
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:47:00.783]  Talk about issues here on air and then word for word hear Trump say it two days later.
[00:47:00.783 --> 00:47:04.444]  And I'm not just calling ourselves liberal because that takes it away from them.
[00:47:04.444 --> 00:47:09.047]  Liberalism, if you studied it 200 years ago, is antithetical to modern liberalism.
[00:47:09.047 --> 00:47:12.048]  It is the complete 180 opposite.
[00:47:12.048 --> 00:47:16.070]  Liberalism means do what you want as long as you hurt somebody else, but I can live the way I want.
[00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:17.671]  Don't come force me to live the
[00:47:24.755 --> 00:47:24.935]  Yes.
[00:47:48.149 --> 00:47:55.895]  It really, really shows how their entire system is based around race baiting, and it really is a despicable, despicable news organization.
[00:47:55.895 --> 00:48:09.425]  And quite frankly, I don't even give them interviews when they ask for interview requests because they always just talk to me for like five minutes, use a short clip to act like they were journalists and act like they got my response.
[00:48:09.425 --> 00:48:14.909]  But they don't even call now to try to get a response whenever they take what we say out of context or twist things because
[00:48:15.769 --> 00:48:17.190]  These are not journalists, folks.
[00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:19.271]  They know they're paid mercenaries.
[00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:21.012]  They know they're paid hacks.
[00:48:21.012 --> 00:48:24.355]  And they know good damn well they're trying to basically undermine this country.
[00:48:24.355 --> 00:48:25.435]  They've conquered us.
[00:48:25.435 --> 00:48:27.236]  That's why they're so arrogant.
[00:48:27.236 --> 00:48:33.280]  And people have to understand that if you're under their mind control, under their spell, come out of it, folks.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:34.261]  They are predators.
[00:48:34.261 --> 00:48:35.762]  They are bad news.
[00:48:35.762 --> 00:48:37.182]  They did back the Arab Spring.
[00:48:37.182 --> 00:48:39.244]  They did back starting wars with Russia.
[00:48:39.244 --> 00:48:40.925]  These are very bad people.
[00:48:42.443 --> 00:48:46.106]  And we've got to bring nationalism back in a big way, folks.
[00:48:46.106 --> 00:48:52.771]  It's how we can organize against globalism, because at least a nation has a chance for the people to run it and to fix it.
[00:48:52.771 --> 00:48:54.512]  Under globalism, it's a worldwide system.
[00:48:54.512 --> 00:48:58.475]  You can't get out of it unless nations begin to pull out of it, and that's happening.
[00:48:58.475 --> 00:49:07.822]  So a modern war is taking place right now of the nation-state and individuals and self-determination against a modern royalty.
[00:49:07.822 --> 00:49:11.525]  The true definition of globalism is third wave
[00:49:12.856 --> 00:49:21.603]  Corporate colonialism establishing a planetary above the law corporate dictatorship.
[00:49:21.603 --> 00:49:24.206]  I mean that's what it is.
[00:49:24.206 --> 00:49:29.090]  And so no one should want to live under that and there's no arguments that you can push for that.
[00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:35.315]  But now their their new argument is we're going to quote be liberal world government actually say that the economists
[00:49:36.178 --> 00:49:41.741]  We've got to be smart enough to come together, turn on the real renaissance, basically terraform the planet for clean, renewable technocracy for the people.
[00:50:00.697 --> 00:50:00.957]  That's
[00:50:25.739 --> 00:50:34.724]  I'm Alex Jones signing off for InfoWars.com and I'm going to go ahead and hand the baton back to David Knight in the full broadcast he's got lined up today and I'll be back later with a special report.
[00:50:34.724 --> 00:50:36.205]  Turkey has declared war on Syria.
[00:50:36.205 --> 00:50:39.026]  Does this mean that World War III is about to erupt?
[00:50:39.026 --> 00:50:48.552]  That's InfoWars.com and even the London Telegraph says that most experts agree this could trigger the next third world war because when Turkey declares war against
[00:50:50.038 --> 00:50:52.906]  Syria is allied with Russia.
[00:50:52.906 --> 00:50:57.096]  That means a NATO nation has now declared war on Russia.
[00:50:57.096 --> 00:50:57.958]  That's what this really means.
[00:50:57.958 --> 00:50:58.419]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.652 --> 00:51:05.456]  Will the government protect your family from Iran and North Korea's newest weapon, EMP?

[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:17.883]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:17.883 --> 00:54:19.383]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:54:19.383 --> 00:54:25.086]  I want to give you a feel for Donald Trump's Treasury Secretary pick, Mnuchin.
[00:54:25.086 --> 00:54:26.087]  He had some comments today.
[00:54:26.087 --> 00:54:28.228]  I want to play a couple of those in just one moment.
[00:54:28.228 --> 00:54:36.412]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to remind you that we have extended for a final day some of our Black Friday specials, our Cyber Monday specials.

[00:55:11.093 --> 00:55:12.875]  This is a great time to stock up.
[00:55:12.875 --> 00:55:14.276]  We really appreciate your support.
[00:55:14.276 --> 00:55:16.939]  That is why it has helped us have such a big impact.
[00:55:17.419 --> 00:55:32.372]  That they are doing regular hit pieces on CNN just as they're trying to ban us and shut us down, trying to shut us down through the news aggregators that they're creating with Apple's operating system, as well as taking Breitbart out of the App Store.
[00:55:32.372 --> 00:55:35.134]  So this is the kind of pushback that they're doing.
[00:55:35.134 --> 00:55:38.277]  As Alex pointed out in that last piece, it's absolutely amazing.
[00:55:38.857 --> 00:55:55.417]  To see the dishonest, fake news of CNN putting his picture up there, then putting a lower thirds underneath it, former Ku Klux Klan leader, and not saying coming up or anything, just former Ku Klux Klan leader, and then underneath that, Alex Jones and InfoWars.com.
[00:55:56.058 --> 00:55:58.980]  I mean, how incredibly dishonest that is.
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:02.902]  But that's the kind of below-the-belt attacks that they do.
[00:56:02.902 --> 00:56:06.944]  We're going to talk about the real voter fraud coming up in the next hour.
[00:56:06.944 --> 00:56:10.926]  We're going to have Owen Schroeder and Darren McBrain joining me.
[00:56:10.926 --> 00:56:13.167]  And we've got another report from Alex Jones coming up.
[00:56:13.167 --> 00:56:14.308]  But let's take a look.
[00:56:14.848 --> 00:56:23.552]  Edwin Mnuchin, who has been the campaign finance manager for Donald Trump since May, and he was announced as Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary.
[00:56:23.552 --> 00:56:28.834]  Let's take a look at what he said in terms of his vision for the economy.
[00:56:28.834 --> 00:56:31.595]  How much money is sitting overseas right now?
[00:56:31.595 --> 00:56:34.256]  We're talking about two trillion dollars or something?
[00:56:34.256 --> 00:56:36.057]  It's a staggering number.
[00:56:36.057 --> 00:56:42.019]  First of all, the reason why American companies don't bring the cash back is because the differential in tax rates.
[00:56:42.019 --> 00:56:44.140]  So the combination of lowering the corporate tax
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:44.900]  I think?
[00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:10.888]  Hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars that's going to come back and that's going to create infrastructure and create jobs.
[00:57:10.888 --> 00:57:17.750]  Well, it makes no sense on one level but it makes a lot of sense on another level because you've got zero percent interest rates.
[00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:22.291]  Right, but you already have Apple talking about now bringing factories back.
[00:57:22.291 --> 00:57:22.771]  I love it.
[00:57:22.771 --> 00:57:24.991]  Did you hear that last year or the year before?
[00:57:24.991 --> 00:57:25.492]  No.
[00:57:25.492 --> 00:57:26.692]  Now you're hearing it.
[00:57:26.692 --> 00:57:27.092]  Exactly.
[00:57:27.905 --> 00:57:33.089]  Okay, and that was also the other person you heard talking there was Ross, who was a pick for Commerce Secretary.
[00:57:33.089 --> 00:57:37.993]  Yeah, we want to get companies to base themselves back in the United States again.
[00:57:37.993 --> 00:57:38.994]  Is that a bad idea?
[00:57:38.994 --> 00:57:42.736]  How about stopping them from moving to another country in the first place?
[00:57:42.736 --> 00:57:45.599]  And of course, that's something that Donald Trump has been working on very hard.
[00:57:45.599 --> 00:57:47.080]  He was working on it on Thanksgiving.
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:50.763]  They announced a carrier deal, as I pointed out before, we don't know what it is, but it is a
[00:57:51.863 --> 00:57:57.927]  An effort by someone who's not even become president yet and already he's keeping jobs in the United States.
[00:57:57.927 --> 00:58:00.148]  Mnuchin said the carrier deal, I think, is terrific.
[00:58:00.148 --> 00:58:07.333]  He said the president-elect and the vice president picked up the phone, called the CEO of United Technologies, told them that we want to keep jobs here and this is it.
[00:58:07.333 --> 00:58:11.455]  He said, I can't remember the last time a president did that.
[00:58:11.455 --> 00:58:14.277]  This is going to be a terrific opportunity.
[00:58:14.277 --> 00:58:15.238]  That's why we're so hopeful.
[00:58:15.982 --> 00:58:25.386]  Donald Trump is working very hard and we're going to talk in the next hour as well about the announcements that he is going to diverge himself from these business issues.
[00:58:25.386 --> 00:58:25.946]  Why?
[00:58:25.946 --> 00:58:28.647]  Because his first priority is being president.
[00:58:28.647 --> 00:58:31.628]  We've already seen that with the settlement that he made on that lawsuit.
[00:58:31.628 --> 00:58:35.550]  We'll talk more about that in the next hour with Owen Schor and Darren McBrain.
[00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:36.650]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[00:59:46.864 --> 00:59:52.406]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:59:52.406 --> 00:59:55.047]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.754 --> 01:00:18.420]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:24.065]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:41.988 --> 01:01:01.196]  15-year-old Somali refugee Abdul Razak Ali Artan, who obtained a green card to enter the United States in 2014, injured 11 students on the Ohio State University campus yesterday, first striking them with a car and then exiting the car to attack the students with a butcher knife.
[01:01:01.736 --> 01:01:12.770]  WorldNet Daily reports Campus Police Chief Craig Stone said, Our officer was on the scene in less than a minute and he ended the situation in less than a minute.
[01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:16.194]  He engaged the suspect and he eliminated the threat.
[01:01:16.194 --> 01:01:18.057]  The suspect is DOA.
[01:01:18.397 --> 01:01:27.259]  Artan had been quoted in the campus newspaper, The Lantern, several months ago complaining about the school's lack of Islamic prayer rooms.
[01:01:27.259 --> 01:01:34.261]  He blamed the negative view Americans have of Muslims on Islamophobia planted in their minds by the U.S.
[01:01:34.261 --> 01:01:37.982]  media, not by the numerous terror attacks or sexual assaults.
[01:01:38.442 --> 01:01:41.926]  And the delusional blame game continues to mushroom.
[01:01:41.926 --> 01:01:56.481]  Tariq Nasheed, an extreme left documentary filmmaker, bemoaned, so white officer Alan Heruko, who shot and killed the black Somali stabbing suspect in Ohio, is being paraded as a hero?
[01:01:56.481 --> 01:01:57.522]  That's interesting.
[01:01:57.902 --> 01:02:10.272]  Anti-Second Amendment Senator Tim Kaine tweeted, deeply saddened by the senseless act of gun violence at Ohio State this morning, praying for the injured and the entire Buckeye community.
[01:02:10.272 --> 01:02:12.334]  Of course, no gun was used.
[01:02:12.334 --> 01:02:20.280]  Paul Joseph Watson pointed out that a woman named Kaye tweeted, poor kid goes through hell as a child in Somalia, comes to America,
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.042]  Probably been bullied by racists in white Ohio.
[01:02:24.042 --> 01:02:25.242]  Now he's dead.
[01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:26.423]  Thanks, Trump.
[01:02:26.423 --> 01:02:34.546]  And even the New World Order chimed in as Anna de Rothschild tweeted, Meanwhile, back here in reality that exists 24-7 outside of the Twitter universe,
[01:02:46.932 --> 01:02:52.397]  People in Columbus, Ohio now have more reason to be looking over their shoulder.
[01:02:52.397 --> 01:03:06.090]  As recent as February of 2016, Mohammed Barry, a Muslim immigrant from Guinea, charged into the Nazareth restaurant and deli in Columbus, Ohio and attacked the patrons with a machete in what was described as a bloodbath.
[01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:07.391]  Barry was shot dead.
[01:03:07.711 --> 01:03:15.996]  CNSNews.com reports 98,799 Somali refugees have settled in the United States since 9-11.
[01:03:15.996 --> 01:03:26.142]  More than 99% of those refugees are Muslim, reflecting the religious makeup of Somalia's population, which is almost entirely Muslim, predominantly Sunni.
[01:03:26.142 --> 01:03:31.945]  The largest number of Somali refugees arriving in the country since 9-11 have been settled in Minnesota,
[01:03:32.285 --> 01:03:33.905]  Almost 16,000.
[01:03:33.905 --> 01:03:35.486]  Ohio, more than 7,500.
[01:03:35.486 --> 01:03:40.247]  And sizable communities also in Texas, New York, and Arizona.
[01:03:40.247 --> 01:03:42.968]  America chose Trump for a reason.
[01:03:42.968 --> 01:03:54.990]  Paul Joseph Watson writes, Just three weeks ago, Trump cautioned that Somali migrants in states such as Minnesota were refusing to integrate and that a portion of them posed a terror threat.
[01:03:54.990 --> 01:04:01.792]  Some of them are joining ISIS and spreading their extremist views all over our country and all over the world, said Trump.
[01:04:01.892 --> 01:04:09.517]  Of course, no one wants to call it a terror attack, but Barry and Artaan were just following orders from terrorists.
[01:04:09.517 --> 01:04:28.068]  Business Insider reports, Michael Smith, the founder of security from Cronus Advisory, who has advised Congress on terror-related issues, pointed out on Twitter that an ISIS video released days before the OSU attack showed a French ISIS member demonstrating how to kill people using knives.
[01:04:28.288 --> 01:04:39.152]  The ISIS member also called for attacks in the West, and in the past two months, English-language ISIS propaganda magazines have called for vehicle and knife attacks.
[01:04:39.152 --> 01:04:42.773]  Sorry, Anna de Rothschild and Senator Tim Kaine.
[01:04:42.773 --> 01:04:51.596]  Thanks to people like you and your globalist policies, this is precisely why Americans need their Second Amendment rights.
[01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:53.517]  John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[01:05:00.319 --> 01:05:08.824]  A gun scare at a swanky hotel in New York City last night resulted in police swarming the lobby and taking four people into custody.
[01:05:08.824 --> 01:05:11.846]  Now, I'm talking, of course, about the Gramercy Park Hotel.
[01:05:11.846 --> 01:05:20.291]  A report coming out of a CBS local affiliate in New York says the guests at the five-star hotel were greeted with storms of police last night over, quote, terror concerns.
[01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:26.015]  Four people were ultimately taken into custody over a Facebook Live video that they were conducting in the hotel room.
[01:05:26.135 --> 01:05:29.898]  Now, these guests in the lobby were obviously greeted with massive police.
[01:05:29.898 --> 01:05:36.282]  They were rightfully confused, and one of them said she was, quote, shocked by the incident, wanting to just leave the lobby as soon as possible.
[01:05:36.282 --> 01:05:41.285]  Police arriving around 4.15 with a report of a threat because of the Facebook Live post.
[01:05:41.285 --> 01:05:48.730]  Now, this is what one police spokesperson told Patch News around 7 p.m., quote, a bunch of people were arrested for having BB guns at the location.
[01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:55.315]  Yes, they were live streaming with BB guns and drug paraphernalia in the room, creating an all-out terror threat alert.
[01:05:55.635 --> 01:05:57.001]  This is what it's come to, folks.
[01:05:57.001 --> 01:05:58.889]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:06:00.205 --> 01:06:02.846]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[01:06:02.846 --> 01:06:05.006]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[01:06:05.006 --> 01:06:10.727]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house.
[01:06:10.727 --> 01:06:13.808]  Like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling.
[01:06:13.808 --> 01:06:16.329]  The best part though, you can take it with you.
[01:06:16.329 --> 01:06:17.049]  It's mobile.
[01:06:17.049 --> 01:06:22.210]  To jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:25.591]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity.
[01:06:25.931 --> 01:06:29.353]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[01:06:29.353 --> 01:06:30.374]  A true innovation.
[01:06:30.374 --> 01:06:32.456]  I have never seen anything like this.
[01:06:32.456 --> 01:06:34.177]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[01:06:34.177 --> 01:06:36.718]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[01:06:36.718 --> 01:06:40.881]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[01:06:40.881 --> 01:06:42.983]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.
[01:06:42.983 --> 01:06:45.024]  That's privatepowergrid.com.

[01:08:17.311 --> 01:08:19.993]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:08:26.275 --> 01:08:27.756]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:27.756 --> 01:08:32.020]  I'm David Knight here with Owen Schroeder and Darin McBreen, a couple of our other reporters.
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:39.826]  We're going to be talking about the attack piece on Alex Jones by CNN and this narrative of fake news.
[01:08:39.826 --> 01:08:43.969]  But of course, we just heard that report from John Bowne, the top of the hour.
[01:08:45.014 --> 01:09:03.231]  Talking about how the left is trying to defend this guy who attacked people in OSU, and of course I've got an article here from Politico, solidly in the Hillary Clinton left camp, solidly attacking Donald Trump, saying, Trump tweets that the alleged OSU attacker should not have been in our country.
[01:09:03.231 --> 01:09:04.632]  They think this is a winning issue.
[01:09:04.632 --> 01:09:07.075]  That's how out of touch they are with the electorate.
[01:09:07.595 --> 01:09:20.775]  And of course, Trump said on Wednesday morning that the OSU student who allegedly wounded, okay, I don't know that we need the allegedly there, several people during a stabbing attack was, quote, a refugee who should not have been in our country.
[01:09:20.775 --> 01:09:22.698]  You know, were these people, was he vetted?
[01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:28.642]  When I saw these reports, guys, they didn't even know what his age was.
[01:09:28.642 --> 01:09:29.923]  Plus or minus five years.
[01:09:29.923 --> 01:09:34.286]  They don't know anything about this guy, and yet he is a legal, permanent resident.
[01:09:34.286 --> 01:09:36.848]  This is what Donald Trump said from the very beginning.
[01:09:36.848 --> 01:09:40.691]  They tried to push this thing by saying, well, you know, he wanted to ban all Muslims.
[01:09:40.691 --> 01:09:48.316]  No, what he was saying was, we need to stop all immigration from certain countries until we can vet the people who are coming in so we don't have this exact thing.
[01:09:48.316 --> 01:09:53.419]  He was proven right, and now they continue to try to attack him, saying, look, he's attacking Muslims.
[01:09:53.559 --> 01:09:55.101]  It's those Muslims who are attacking us.
[01:09:55.101 --> 01:10:00.285]  By the way, Jimmy Carter did the same thing during his administration in the 70s.
[01:10:00.285 --> 01:10:04.589]  And that was to stop any people from Iran coming in.
[01:10:04.589 --> 01:10:05.891]  And they were seriously vetted.
[01:10:05.891 --> 01:10:12.597]  And a lot of them were not allowed into the country because of the whole Iran crisis and the whole hostage crisis.
[01:10:12.597 --> 01:10:18.522]  So they always try to make this a kind of a Republican type of thing, but the Democrats did the same thing in the 70s.
[01:10:19.383 --> 01:10:24.727]  Well, how are you supposed to properly vet people that come from a country that doesn't have any infrastructure?
[01:10:24.727 --> 01:10:29.952]  How are you supposed to find out somebody's age who doesn't even know it themselves?
[01:10:29.952 --> 01:10:30.292]  Yeah.
[01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:36.817]  So we know that this is going on, and this is something that, you know, refugee programs have to deal with.
[01:10:36.817 --> 01:10:43.143]  I mean, this is a humanitarian effort to take care of these people, but the problem is, ISIS knows this.
[01:10:43.143 --> 01:10:47.106]  So what they do is, they infiltrate these refugee groups, they say,
[01:10:47.446 --> 01:10:49.429]  Oh, I don't know my age.
[01:10:49.429 --> 01:10:50.771]  I don't know where I came from.
[01:10:50.771 --> 01:10:53.114]  I'm from a country with no infrastructure.
[01:10:53.114 --> 01:10:58.662]  And of course the problem is we created ISIS and we created the regime overthrow that created the refugees.
[01:10:58.662 --> 01:10:59.363]  We created that.
[01:10:59.363 --> 01:11:02.328]  So when you look at the Aleppo boy and your heart goes out to him, as it should,
[01:11:02.828 --> 01:11:16.637]  I understand that it was Hillary Clinton who set the Middle East on fire, who created this situation, and who tried to do everything they can to prevent the Assad regime or the Russians who are working with them to try to stop this and get back to a peaceful situation.
[01:11:16.637 --> 01:11:17.097]  Hold on a minute.
[01:11:17.097 --> 01:11:17.678]  They're not better off.
[01:11:17.678 --> 01:11:19.219]  CNN says that's a conspiracy.
[01:11:19.219 --> 01:11:19.579]  That's right.
[01:11:19.579 --> 01:11:20.299]  I heard it last night.
[01:11:20.299 --> 01:11:22.801]  It is a conspiracy, but it's not a theory, okay?
[01:11:22.801 --> 01:11:25.623]  Let's talk about the fake news of CNN.
[01:11:25.623 --> 01:11:28.345]  We've got a Trump economist, Steve Moore, who takes them on.
[01:11:28.345 --> 01:11:30.206]  I want to play this clip and get your comments on this.
[01:11:31.536 --> 01:11:35.818]  When I say fake news, I mean stories that are designed to trick people into believing lies.
[01:11:35.818 --> 01:11:36.858]  Let's be clear.
[01:11:36.858 --> 01:11:38.459]  Donald Trump will lose the election.
[01:11:38.459 --> 01:11:40.019]  Right now, Donald Trump will lose the election.
[01:11:40.019 --> 01:11:42.940]  I mean, if you look at the battleground states right now, Donald Trump's gonna lose.
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:45.021]  This is different what Donald Trump's doing.
[01:11:45.021 --> 01:11:46.282]  It's sinister.
[01:11:46.282 --> 01:11:48.262]  It reeks of Joe McCarthy.
[01:11:48.262 --> 01:11:49.683]  Texas is still competitive.
[01:11:50.143 --> 01:11:51.564]  Is the election over?
[01:11:51.564 --> 01:11:55.286]  I mean, a lot of political scientists would say, at this point, nothing matters.
[01:11:55.286 --> 01:11:58.548]  The Citibank said, if Trump's elected, the market will go down three to five percent.
[01:11:58.548 --> 01:12:01.390]  If Donald Trump wins the election, the stock market will tank.
[01:12:01.390 --> 01:12:02.371]  And that would hurt the stock market.
[01:12:02.371 --> 01:12:05.152]  If Trump were to win, you know, the stock market would go down.
[01:12:05.152 --> 01:12:08.094]  You know, one of the pillars of the infamous blue wall.
[01:12:08.174 --> 01:12:11.196]  Think about if she can hold there, that's a key part of that blue wall.
[01:12:11.196 --> 01:12:13.598]  Trump clearly going after that blue wall.
[01:12:13.598 --> 01:12:18.482]  It's whether Hillary Clinton's going to win by a small margin or whether we're going to essentially annihilate Donald Trump.
[01:12:18.482 --> 01:12:19.283]  I think Hillary will win.
[01:12:19.283 --> 01:12:22.565]  I think most analysts are saying that Hillary Clinton's going to win in a landslide.
[01:12:22.565 --> 01:12:24.527]  I don't think it's likely that Hillary Clinton will win.
[01:12:24.747 --> 01:12:29.172]  38 or 40% of people, roughly speaking, are going to have voted for Trump.
[01:12:29.172 --> 01:12:35.479]  And if Donald Trump does lose, particularly if he loses in the face of a massive turnout from Latino communities.
[01:12:35.479 --> 01:12:38.422]  But there's an invisible surge with Latinos.
[01:12:38.422 --> 01:12:41.025]  The surge of the Latino vote, that that's going to be enough.
[01:12:41.465 --> 01:12:43.647]  A surge in Hispanic Latino voting.
[01:12:43.647 --> 01:12:47.130]  This is the number right here we're all going to be talking about after the election.
[01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:48.471]  It is the Hispanic vote.
[01:12:48.471 --> 01:12:50.513]  But the surge of Latino voters.
[01:12:50.513 --> 01:12:55.837]  African-American voters and Hispanic voters and college-educated white women especially are coming out in droves.
[01:12:55.837 --> 01:12:59.541]  He claims that the media is lying and that it's reporting cannot be believed.
[01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:01.182]  So Donald Trump will lose.
[01:13:01.182 --> 01:13:03.304]  They're the most basic pure form of fake news.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:07.361]  Yeah, the most purest form of fake news.
[01:13:07.361 --> 01:13:10.143]  You just saw it, the clips from the mainstream media themselves.
[01:13:10.143 --> 01:13:11.263]  And everybody has seen that.
[01:13:11.263 --> 01:13:15.045]  Just a reminder in that real tight clip of what they've been lying to you about.
[01:13:15.045 --> 01:13:16.866]  And so they're trying to get that back.
[01:13:16.866 --> 01:13:20.848]  And of course, they can't let go, guys, of this notion that Donald Trump actually won.
[01:13:20.848 --> 01:13:24.909]  I mean, they were trying to drag them into reality, kicking and screaming.
[01:13:24.909 --> 01:13:28.991]  But they keep screaming and kicking even louder, trying to say, we're going to pull this back.
[01:13:28.991 --> 01:13:30.872]  Oh, the Electoral College has got to go this and that.
[01:13:30.872 --> 01:13:32.393]  We're going to have a revolt of electors.
[01:13:32.913 --> 01:13:34.274]  None of that's going to happen.
[01:13:34.274 --> 01:13:38.698]  And yet, this piece that they did last night when we said, yeah, there really is election fraud.
[01:13:38.698 --> 01:13:40.099]  There really is voter fraud.
[01:13:40.099 --> 01:13:40.840]  Everybody knows that.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:41.821]  Yeah, we know that.
[01:13:41.821 --> 01:13:50.729]  And so, you want to create this false illusion that Hillary Clinton, and it's amazing to watch this after the election, these people continue to persist, but I keep watching her vote total grow.
[01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:53.389]  You know, well, she's going to win by a million votes.
[01:13:53.389 --> 01:13:56.130]  No, by a million and a half, two million, two and a half.
[01:13:56.130 --> 01:14:00.471]  And then the last one I saw, I think it was on Daily News, they said, well, currently she's leading by two and a half million.
[01:14:00.471 --> 01:14:07.252]  I was like, well, folks, the real election ended about three weeks ago, but you keep pushing this and you keep padding it.
[01:14:07.252 --> 01:14:14.894]  And that's precisely why we need the electoral colleges as a firewall against the corruption where in places like New York, they can continue to pad the vote.
[01:14:14.894 --> 01:14:16.454]  Well, The Onion ought to write a story.
[01:14:16.454 --> 01:14:16.954]  Hillary Clinton
[01:14:16.954 --> 01:14:17.214]  I don't
[01:14:41.042 --> 01:14:44.264]  We've got people, you know, overlooking the elections to make sure they're happening.
[01:14:44.264 --> 01:14:46.365]  So they tried to have their cake and eat it too there.
[01:14:46.365 --> 01:14:48.046]  Now they're trying to do it again!
[01:14:48.046 --> 01:14:54.629]  They're demonizing Donald Trump for talking about illegal voting or voter fraud while they're recounting the election!
[01:14:54.629 --> 01:15:02.693]  And of course she said that it was absolutely, it was going to destroy the fabric of American democracy to question the results of the election.
[01:15:02.693 --> 01:15:05.995]  Yeah, the peaceful, it's a tradition to overchange power peacefully.
[01:15:05.995 --> 01:15:06.816]  That's right.
[01:15:06.816 --> 01:15:09.237]  Well, CNN, they're digging their own grave.
[01:15:09.617 --> 01:15:12.560]  Right, they've lost all touch with the American people.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:16.024]  I mean, they're basically tabloid journalism.
[01:15:16.024 --> 01:15:20.629]  And the more these hit pieces come out, I think, thanks for the plug.
[01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:22.911]  I mean, a lot of people, they had, I'll give them this much.
[01:15:22.911 --> 01:15:23.432]  It looked good.
[01:15:23.432 --> 01:15:27.696]  For the first time, at least I saw Alex Jones, pictures of Alex looked good.
[01:15:28.337 --> 01:15:36.962]  You know, usually they'll show him from like 2006 in our old studio to kind of give us a, you know, not such a credibility look.
[01:15:36.962 --> 01:15:44.406]  More like Bill O'Reilly did on Fox News, just showing a red face and screaming about something that doesn't have anything to do with what he's talking about there.
[01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:47.008]  Just take a little short little clip there to try to make him look bad.
[01:15:47.908 --> 01:15:51.733]  Go to an interview that Alex had after the election with Bev Harris.
[01:15:51.733 --> 01:15:54.396]  This is somebody who follows election fraud.
[01:15:54.396 --> 01:15:55.437]  She's a Democrat.
[01:15:55.437 --> 01:16:01.144]  We've had her on every election to talk about the real issues that we need to be concerned about.
[01:16:01.144 --> 01:16:03.546]  And this is something we, what we should not let go of.
[01:16:04.847 --> 01:16:10.850]  ...are things that we could do to improve the honest and true election that we have.
[01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:21.255]  And there's a lot of systemic fraud that is built into this, from not having people's voter IDs to allowing electronic voting machines where you deliberately shut down the auditing capability.
[01:16:21.255 --> 01:16:23.056]  Those things need to be looked at by everybody.
[01:16:23.056 --> 01:16:24.877]  Left and right needs to come back and look at that.
[01:16:24.877 --> 01:16:26.258]  But that's not how they're using this.
[01:16:26.838 --> 01:16:34.851]  And so I want to play and get your reactions to this Bev Harris report where she's talking about how they tried to steal the election from Trump, but they failed.
[01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:38.150]  I don't know.
[01:16:58.407 --> 01:16:59.508]  But they weren't in full control.
[01:16:59.508 --> 01:17:00.650]  You can't stop a landslide.
[01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:02.472]  I don't know Beth Harris's view on this yet.
[01:17:02.472 --> 01:17:04.815]  I want to find out, but I respect it.
[01:17:04.815 --> 01:17:07.317]  She is the expert globally.
[01:17:07.317 --> 01:17:08.359]  I'm not bragging.
[01:17:08.359 --> 01:17:09.400]  It's just a fact for us.
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:12.063]  People need to know how accomplished and on target she is.
[01:17:12.063 --> 01:17:15.687]  She's had more exposure of election fraud than everybody else combined.
[01:17:15.687 --> 01:17:17.329]  That's not pooh-poohing all those great folks.
[01:17:17.329 --> 01:17:18.390]  She is so effective.
[01:17:18.871 --> 01:17:21.214]  And when she was on a week and a half ago, it made national news.
[01:17:21.214 --> 01:17:23.918]  She released the information here on the fraction magic.
[01:17:23.918 --> 01:17:31.127]  These programs they found around the country that have no reason to be there but for fraud to pre-program what's going to happen at the central system.
[01:17:31.127 --> 01:17:32.929]  And of course Soros is involved and she just said it.
[01:17:32.929 --> 01:17:35.633]  You know, most of the evidence is just the Democrats and Soros.
[01:17:35.633 --> 01:17:36.854]  It looks like they're trying to do this.
[01:17:37.675 --> 01:17:37.896]  I'm not.
[01:17:53.112 --> 01:17:58.515]  That again, Bev Harris has always said on the show for 15 years, you can't steal a landslide.
[01:17:58.515 --> 01:18:02.098]  Now, I'm going to find out if I'm wrong or I'm right here from her.
[01:18:02.098 --> 01:18:04.119]  But of course, we're pretty close to this right now.
[01:18:04.119 --> 01:18:06.961]  We'll know more as it unfolds.
[01:18:06.961 --> 01:18:10.363]  But Bev Harris, I mean, is that a basically accurate what I said or is it wrong?
[01:18:12.172 --> 01:18:13.393]  Yeah, basically accurate.
[01:18:13.393 --> 01:18:15.013]  You did pretty good, Alex.
[01:18:15.013 --> 01:18:20.315]  You know, as I was watching yesterday, a few things, a few observations.
[01:18:20.315 --> 01:18:29.759]  One thing struck me very early in the morning yesterday is they had been planning fireworks, and then they suddenly, the Clinton campaign suddenly canceled their fireworks.
[01:18:29.759 --> 01:18:40.803]  They did this early in the morning, which makes me curious as to whether, you know, their intel, they already knew they were in trouble at that point, because it didn't make sense otherwise.
[01:18:42.179 --> 01:18:57.448]  Another thing that struck me though, I have seen, particularly with the Democrats, a tactic where they'll take a concentrated blue area and hold back the results for hours and hours and hours.
[01:18:57.448 --> 01:19:03.832]  That's, for example, when Hillary ran against Obama in the primary in Indiana.
[01:19:03.832 --> 01:19:10.016]  Yeah, let's hold that right there because we're coming up to a break and what you just said about them holding the vote, that is something I've seen over and over again.
[01:19:10.799 --> 01:19:11.499]  Show us your card.
[01:19:11.499 --> 01:19:13.823]  You know, you're playing a game of poker, right?
[01:19:13.823 --> 01:19:16.887]  And then it's always the urban areas that are under control of the Democrats.
[01:19:16.887 --> 01:19:22.294]  Just like we saw in North Carolina where there's a very close gubernatorial race there where they tried to pull it out for Hillary Clinton.
[01:19:22.294 --> 01:19:26.720]  They let the most heavily controlled Democrat area go for another hour and a half.
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:31.304]  And then they came in with 100,000 votes for the Democrat candidate there.
[01:19:31.304 --> 01:19:32.945]  That's what we've seen over and over again.
[01:19:32.945 --> 01:19:39.971]  But this is the first time I've seen them holding back their votes and continuing to pump these things in for like three weeks after the election.
[01:19:39.971 --> 01:19:41.412]  I mean, it's absolutely insane.
[01:19:41.412 --> 01:19:55.843]  We're going to be right back with Owen Schroeder and Darren McBreen and we're going to talk more about how there are other people besides Bev Harris pointing out how this thing is going to be audited and we're going to show you exactly how they rigged this election.
[01:19:55.843 --> 01:19:56.464]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:00.586 --> 01:20:05.367]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:20:05.367 --> 01:20:11.249]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[01:20:11.249 --> 01:20:17.750]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:21.791]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[01:24:03.413 --> 01:24:04.617]  Yeah.
[01:24:10.839 --> 01:24:12.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.841]  I'm David Knight with Owen Shore and Darren McBreen.
[01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:16.902]  And Darren is going to be with us to the bottom of the hour.
[01:24:16.902 --> 01:24:24.085]  At the bottom of the hour, Alex is going to be joining us with a report about provocative actions from Turkey and NATO.
[01:24:24.085 --> 01:24:25.926]  Still trying to provoke war with Russia.
[01:24:25.926 --> 01:24:28.087]  And of course, that's something we should be very concerned about.
[01:24:28.087 --> 01:24:30.768]  I've had a number of discussions.
[01:24:30.768 --> 01:24:33.850]  I've had an interview with a Russian news source.
[01:24:33.850 --> 01:24:34.470]  It's amazing
[01:24:34.990 --> 01:24:41.480]  How optimistic they are because they've seen a loaded gun to their head, which they're still pointing at their head at this moment.
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:45.225]  But they've seen that they felt a great sense of relief with Trump's election.
[01:24:45.225 --> 01:24:47.148]  So hopefully this is not something that's going to continue.
[01:24:47.148 --> 01:24:48.470]  We're going to get to that CNN report.
[01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:49.852]  I want to get your comments on this, Darren.
[01:24:50.132 --> 01:24:59.137]  Real quickly, though, before we go back to the news, we have for the last day today extended the specials that began on Black Friday and continued on through Cyber Monday.

[01:25:31.281 --> 01:25:33.463]  This is the last day for these specials.
[01:25:33.463 --> 01:25:34.884]  So take a look at these specials.
[01:25:34.884 --> 01:25:36.766]  Massive discounts.
[01:25:36.766 --> 01:25:39.209]  30%, 30 to 40%, 50% off.
[01:25:39.209 --> 01:25:46.116]  Big discounts across the board on these basic items that you need for your preparedness and for your family's health.
[01:25:46.736 --> 01:25:51.080]  Darren, talk about what you think is the overall strategy of CNN.
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:54.223]  We were talking about that during the break, but just tell the audience what you see.
[01:25:54.223 --> 01:25:55.424]  The overall strategy?
[01:25:55.424 --> 01:25:57.025]  I think it's the chilling effect.
[01:25:57.025 --> 01:26:00.868]  They're trying to send a warning to Donald Trump.
[01:26:00.868 --> 01:26:01.789]  Stop.
[01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:03.250]  Don't refer to InfoWars.
[01:26:04.111 --> 01:26:06.853]  And also, this is a message that they're continuing.
[01:26:06.853 --> 01:26:10.496]  It's the bullet point, the talking point about fake news.
[01:26:10.496 --> 01:26:13.458]  In fact, in the hit piece, they mentioned fake news.
[01:26:13.458 --> 01:26:13.999]  Yeah.
[01:26:13.999 --> 01:26:22.445]  And they said that basically implying that Trump gets his intelligence reports from conspiracy theory websites.
[01:26:22.445 --> 01:26:24.287]  So I think it's a chilling effect.
[01:26:24.287 --> 01:26:27.149]  It's going to backfire just like it always does and always has.
[01:26:27.489 --> 01:26:29.129]  Yeah, they're putting out that narrative as you point out.
[01:26:29.129 --> 01:26:34.271]  Well look, Pence is in all these meetings, and he's getting all the intel briefings, but Trump's just hanging out on Twitter.
[01:26:34.271 --> 01:26:35.151]  That's not true.
[01:26:35.151 --> 01:26:44.753]  Pence came out today and said, I've never seen anybody so engaged, instantly grasping what's going on and asking very deep questions about what's going on.
[01:26:44.753 --> 01:26:50.035]  He catches what these guys are saying, and he asks them very pointed questions about where this headed.
[01:26:50.035 --> 01:26:53.335]  And he's smart not to trust all the intelligence reports.
[01:26:53.335 --> 01:26:55.216]  He doesn't necessarily trust the CIA.
[01:26:55.216 --> 01:26:55.716]  That's right.
[01:26:56.056 --> 01:27:06.588]  And remember, it was Harry Reid who said he's the one that suggested that they give Trump faulty intelligence reports.
[01:27:06.588 --> 01:27:07.750]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:10.012]  So why is he complaining about it?
[01:27:10.012 --> 01:27:13.136]  He's like, he can't trust the intelligence reports, so I mean, come on.
[01:27:13.556 --> 01:27:23.343]  Yeah, it's going to be interesting, because we have a clip they're going to play later in the show, probably when Roger Stone joins us to talk about Trump's picks, because he's had a lot of picks.
[01:27:23.343 --> 01:27:29.407]  And of course, pushing back against that, Chuckie Schumer and Harry Reid had a press conference, and they were saying, well, we're going to have something to say about this.
[01:27:29.407 --> 01:27:31.088]  He's not going to get these confirmed.
[01:27:31.088 --> 01:27:32.709]  Well, it was Harry Reid himself!
[01:27:33.149 --> 01:27:38.136]  Who got rid of the rule of having 60 or 67 senators had to confirm these picks.
[01:27:38.136 --> 01:27:40.238]  He said, no, we're going to do it with just a simple majority of 51.
[01:27:40.238 --> 01:27:42.541]  And so I was like, OK, you made that rule.
[01:27:42.541 --> 01:27:44.003]  You're going to die by that rule.
[01:27:44.003 --> 01:27:46.827]  You're not going to be able to stop any of Trump's picks.
[01:27:46.827 --> 01:27:49.190]  So it's interesting to see how this thing is shaking out.
[01:27:50.091 --> 01:27:53.153]  Well, I don't know what CNN's overall agenda here was.
[01:27:53.153 --> 01:28:09.724]  I think that, just, I checked the Alex Jones channel on YouTube, and just a few hours after CNN ran their hit piece, or promotional plug, honestly, for Alex Jones, if you want to call it that, probably benefited us more than it hurt us, we picked up a couple thousand subscribers on the Alex Jones channel.
[01:28:09.724 --> 01:28:11.125]  I haven't checked it this morning.
[01:28:12.225 --> 01:28:15.566]  But I think we're going to reach 1.9 million soon.
[01:28:15.566 --> 01:28:22.427]  And then maybe with the help of CNN, if they want to continue to hit piece Alex Jones, maybe we'll reach 2 million by the end of the year.
[01:28:22.427 --> 01:28:28.489]  So I encourage CNN to embark on this journey to try to take down or discredit Alex Jones.
[01:28:28.489 --> 01:28:35.090]  I encourage CNN and all of its talking heads to try to attack Alex Jones or try to separate Alex and Donald or try to
[01:28:35.470 --> 01:28:44.277]  Have a chilling effect on Donald Trump not to associate himself with media outlets that aren't Fox, CNN, or television approved news.
[01:28:44.277 --> 01:28:51.542]  You know, it's interesting, we had that report that was recording a radio interview with Donald Trump on 9-11, or the day after.
[01:28:51.542 --> 01:28:53.984]  And the guy was asking about it, he goes, look, I'm a builder.
[01:28:54.544 --> 01:28:57.486]  I know that you're not going to knock down that building especially.
[01:28:57.486 --> 01:28:59.947]  They bombed the foundation, that's the strongest part of the building.
[01:28:59.947 --> 01:29:01.228]  You're not going to knock it down with planes alone.
[01:29:01.228 --> 01:29:02.729]  They had to have bombs or something like that.
[01:29:02.729 --> 01:29:05.771]  He knew from day one something was up with that.
[01:29:05.771 --> 01:29:11.034]  Okay, so that's one of the reasons why he's looking for other answers to what's going on here.
[01:29:11.034 --> 01:29:12.535]  You're not going to fool him with that.
[01:29:12.535 --> 01:29:13.796]  You're not going to gaslight him.
[01:29:13.796 --> 01:29:15.677]  You're not going to scare him away from this.
[01:29:15.677 --> 01:29:19.759]  He's going to look at this stuff and I think he's honest enough when he disagrees with somebody to say it.
[01:29:19.759 --> 01:29:22.861]  And he knew from the very beginning that it was a bunch of nonsense.
[01:29:23.021 --> 01:29:30.044]  He's not afraid to speak out, and this reminds me a little bit, they're trying to do the same thing with the whole birther controversy, okay?
[01:29:30.044 --> 01:29:33.585]  They're saying that InfoWars started the birther controversy.
[01:29:33.585 --> 01:29:37.647]  No, Sheriff Joe Arpaio had a team of investigators check it out.
[01:29:37.647 --> 01:29:39.447]  It was a long, thorough investigation.
[01:29:39.447 --> 01:29:41.068]  And it was actually Hillary who started it.
[01:29:41.068 --> 01:29:44.489]  And then Hillary talked about it, but there was a national press conference.
[01:29:44.489 --> 01:29:45.770]  We sent reporters there.
[01:29:45.770 --> 01:29:46.790]  We covered it.
[01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:47.670]  That's how it started.
[01:29:47.670 --> 01:29:48.551]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:48.551 --> 01:29:51.412]  Alex Jones is going to be talking about what's going on with Turkey and NATO.
[01:30:00.379 --> 01:30:08.045]  There's currently a war going on in this country, and it's waged against Breitbart, InfoWars, and Drudge, in large part because of Trump's victory.
[01:30:08.045 --> 01:30:13.429]  Now, the latest example of this, Apple is purging Breitbart News app from its iTunes store.
[01:30:13.429 --> 01:30:16.232]  We have an article that's up on our website written by Dan Layman.
[01:30:16.232 --> 01:30:20.415]  This latest move, Apple has removed Breitbart News app from their iTunes marketplace.
[01:30:20.635 --> 01:30:23.817]  It's an utter censorship of free speech and truth journalism.
[01:30:23.817 --> 01:30:28.480]  They're kicking it into overdrive despite the app being available for the past three years.
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:34.704]  Now, Breitbart currently ranks 28th on SimilarWeb's top 100 media sites and they had over 168 million page views.
[01:30:36.485 --> 01:30:46.530]  In October alone, but their primary target for a massive concerted effort by these globalists is to suppress and silence all opposition deemed, quote, fake news, including us.
[01:30:46.530 --> 01:30:54.114]  Now, the war on Breitbart has increased because of CEO Steve Bannon, who was ultimately appointed as the White House chief strategist in this latest move.
[01:30:54.114 --> 01:30:56.395]  They're trying to silence all real news.
[01:30:56.395 --> 01:30:58.917]  I'm Margaret Hal reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:31:00.134 --> 01:31:06.679]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:31:06.679 --> 01:31:09.902]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:31:09.902 --> 01:31:15.487]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:31:15.487 --> 01:31:21.612]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:31:21.612 --> 01:31:24.895]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:31:24.895 --> 01:31:26.336]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[01:31:26.536 --> 01:31:30.858]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:31:30.858 --> 01:31:33.799]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:31:33.799 --> 01:31:35.460]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:38.901]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:31:38.901 --> 01:31:41.502]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:31:41.502 --> 01:31:42.563]  It's in powder form.
[01:31:42.563 --> 01:31:45.444]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:31:45.444 --> 01:31:46.164]  I take this.
[01:31:46.164 --> 01:31:47.965]  This is the product that I take.
[01:31:47.965 --> 01:31:49.926]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:31:50.746 --> 01:31:52.707]  We fight the Globals, we fight the New World Order.

[01:31:59.889 --> 01:32:04.371]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLive.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:32:04.371 --> 01:32:15.375]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extractors.
[01:32:15.475 --> 01:32:20.518]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:32:20.518 --> 01:32:23.080]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:24.801]  It helps detoxify.
[01:32:24.801 --> 01:32:27.683]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:32:27.683 --> 01:32:32.466]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:32:32.466 --> 01:32:38.730]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[01:32:38.730 --> 01:32:44.053]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:32:44.053 --> 01:32:44.814]  I'm taking it now.
[01:32:45.054 --> 01:32:45.754]  Every day.
[01:32:45.754 --> 01:32:46.755]  This is so key.
[01:32:46.755 --> 01:32:49.317]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[01:32:49.317 --> 01:32:51.058]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[01:32:51.058 --> 01:32:53.279]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[01:32:53.279 --> 01:32:56.741]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:33:22.137 --> 01:33:27.803]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:27.803 --> 01:33:30.086]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.675 --> 01:33:39.299]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:39.299 --> 01:33:45.125]  I'm David Knight with Owen Schroeder and of course we've been talking about the CNN attack on InfoWars.
[01:33:45.125 --> 01:33:50.691]  You know, we played this quote over and over again from Hillary Clinton where she said, it's an information war and we're losing it.
[01:33:50.691 --> 01:33:54.715]  Well now she's lost the election and they're desperate to try to get this narrative back.
[01:33:54.715 --> 01:33:56.117]  We just saw today, Owen, that
[01:33:57.055 --> 01:33:59.919]  Breitbart's app was taken off of the Apple Store.
[01:33:59.919 --> 01:34:04.764]  They're trying every technique they can to try to get back their monopoly on information.
[01:34:04.764 --> 01:34:09.569]  Because that's the only way that they're going to win is if we don't have a free market of ideas.
[01:34:09.569 --> 01:34:12.653]  Because in that free market of ideas, they can't compete.
[01:34:12.653 --> 01:34:15.716]  And this is the way they go about soft censorship.
[01:34:15.816 --> 01:34:22.778]  Where they don't just have to erase Breitbart, they just have to remove Breitbart from the biggest platform.
[01:34:22.778 --> 01:34:26.359]  So, you know, you have an Android, you have an Apple phone, most people do.
[01:34:26.359 --> 01:34:30.080]  Okay, well, it's still on Android, but if you have Apple, unfortunately, you just can't get Breitbart news.
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:30.800]  Sorry.
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:35.021]  And then there's the other aspect of this, which I think might be the ultimate goal here, David.
[01:34:35.021 --> 01:34:36.562]  I think that this might be the ultimate goal.
[01:34:37.122 --> 01:34:39.803]  Breitbart is not verified on Twitter, okay?
[01:34:39.803 --> 01:34:41.163]  Now, I'm not verified on Twitter.
[01:34:41.163 --> 01:34:45.084]  I really don't give a damn about a Twitter verification, to be personally honest with you.
[01:34:45.084 --> 01:35:00.328]  But, what I think their goal here is, David, to say, essentially, if you're not verified by Facebook or Twitter or whatever the mainstream platform is, if you don't have that checkbook, if you don't have that check or whatever it is, you're fake!
[01:35:00.328 --> 01:35:00.488]  Yeah.
[01:35:00.808 --> 01:35:01.269]  You're fake.
[01:35:01.269 --> 01:35:02.309]  That's how they're going to determine it.
[01:35:02.309 --> 01:35:05.993]  So it's not going to be up to you to verify what's real and what's fake.
[01:35:05.993 --> 01:35:06.373]  No, no, no.
[01:35:06.373 --> 01:35:14.300]  Just leave it up to Big Brother in the form of Facebook or Twitter or whatever social media platform is the biggest at that time.
[01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:16.342]  I think that that's their ultimate goal here.
[01:35:16.342 --> 01:35:20.106]  And that is the true soft censorship to just basically
[01:35:21.127 --> 01:35:22.969]  Keep us from being in the public eye.
[01:35:22.969 --> 01:35:24.451]  Keep InfoWars, Breitbart, whoever it is.
[01:35:24.451 --> 01:35:25.793]  We want to be the gatekeepers.
[01:35:25.793 --> 01:35:30.820]  In the past, when we just had... Instead of you being the gatekeeper, Big Brother's the gatekeeper.
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:36.207]  In the past, when we didn't have the internet, and we didn't have an energized talk radio,
[01:35:36.927 --> 01:35:47.354]  Uh, we had things like the Fairness Doctrine that were imposed by the FCC, which said, no, no, we're only going to, you know, they use the licensing, okay, which is really what they're trying to do in a way with this verification.
[01:35:47.354 --> 01:35:54.398]  They're trying to set up that whole licensing regime, revive that to try to establish their monopoly again of labeling of fake news.
[01:35:54.398 --> 01:35:56.019]  So we understand where they're going.
[01:35:56.019 --> 01:35:57.280]  We understand what their strategy is.
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:04.084]  And of course, when we look at the specifics that they were talking about in this particular report, that's the broader strategy.
[01:36:04.084 --> 01:36:08.807]  Their tactic was to specifically attack Trump on this election issue.
[01:36:08.807 --> 01:36:14.510]  And it's not just us who's saying it, and it's not just Bev Harris who is talking about election fraud.
[01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:19.073]  WND had a report where they talked to Katherine Engelbrecht of True the Vote.
[01:36:19.073 --> 01:36:21.054]  She says she's convinced that Donald Trump is correct.
[01:36:21.434 --> 01:36:42.492]  That there was a lot of voter fraud, and of course, when we talked to Bev Harris, she was talking about election fraud, where they found that on some of the software, instead of having integers, which is what you would expect when you're counting votes, you're only going to have whole numbers, they set it up for floating point calculations, which would mean that they'd be able to do a mathematical transform and allocate votes.
[01:36:42.492 --> 01:36:46.776]  There was absolutely no reason, from a programming perspective, that you'd have anything other than integers.
[01:36:47.296 --> 01:36:51.658]  Unless you were planning on doing something exactly like that where they are summing up the votes.
[01:36:51.658 --> 01:36:53.980]  But this is what TrueTheVote said.
[01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:56.441]  She said, we're going to have a reliable estimate of the number of people here.
[01:36:57.418 --> 01:37:13.387]  She said, we're still collecting data, and we will be for several months, but our intent is to publish a comprehensive study on the significant impact of illegal voting in all of its many forms, and begin a national discussion on how voters, states, and the Trump administration can address this growing problem.
[01:37:13.387 --> 01:37:18.130]  We need to understand that Donald Trump won this because he had a landslide turnout.
[01:37:18.650 --> 01:37:32.625]  Just as we've seen with the people who are showing up to watch him in the public speeches that he gave and Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton couldn't fill up a small basketball stadium or something.
[01:37:32.625 --> 01:37:35.808]  They had massive, tens of thousands of people showing up to see him.
[01:37:35.808 --> 01:37:38.671]  So we understand it was a landslide.
[01:37:38.671 --> 01:37:40.573]  We understand that's how he won.
[01:37:41.314 --> 01:37:43.795]  But we need to get an honest and fair election.
[01:37:43.795 --> 01:37:50.998]  And people even on the left, people in the Democrat Party, the grassroots, of course the people at the top don't want this, but the grassroots should be concerned about that as well.
[01:37:50.998 --> 01:37:56.040]  And she said, nobody has wanted to get the answers for a long time, so questions haven't been allowed to ask.
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.801]  That's the paradigm that we are going to shatter.
[01:37:58.801 --> 01:38:03.123]  And we're going to continue talking about election fraud and the way that things can be changed.
[01:38:03.123 --> 01:38:07.485]  They're only using election fraud to try to discredit Donald Trump, to try to discredit Infowars.
[01:38:07.885 --> 01:38:11.727]  And to try to rig this election, to try to destroy the Electoral College.
[01:38:11.727 --> 01:38:16.729]  Even Politico talks about how there's a hidden agenda with these people who are challenging it.
[01:38:16.729 --> 01:38:19.870]  Their real agenda, they said, is to get rid of the Electoral College.
[01:38:19.870 --> 01:38:31.835]  And we need to understand that it's the Electoral College that is a firewall on the concentration of power into a few urban centers, and the corruption that is there when they can pad these votes and continue adding votes for three weeks.
[01:38:31.835 --> 01:38:35.777]  I mean, that's the insanity of this, and that's what the Electoral College
[01:38:36.317 --> 01:38:36.978]  We're good to go.
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.721]  Probably the whole nine yards.
[01:38:57.721 --> 01:38:58.181]  And you know what?
[01:38:58.181 --> 01:38:59.602]  Globalism is losing around the world.
[01:38:59.602 --> 01:39:03.645]  But David, you come to my desk today, you say, hey Owen, I want to have you on the show.
[01:39:03.645 --> 01:39:07.428]  We have to combat the real fake news here saying that voter fraud doesn't exist.
[01:39:07.428 --> 01:39:10.030]  We have to hit them right in the head with all the evidence.
[01:39:10.030 --> 01:39:14.553]  And I'm just sitting here like, oh my God, I've covered this ad nauseam.
[01:39:14.553 --> 01:39:18.757]  I've done dozens of segments working for InfoWars covering voter fraud.
[01:39:18.757 --> 01:39:20.498]  Like this shouldn't even be going on.
[01:39:20.498 --> 01:39:21.779]  And David, you sit here and you say,
[01:39:22.239 --> 01:39:25.141]  Well, we deserve to live in a country with a fair election.
[01:39:25.141 --> 01:39:26.342]  Absolutely, you do.
[01:39:26.342 --> 01:39:26.842]  But you know what?
[01:39:26.842 --> 01:39:28.784]  It goes beyond that, folks.
[01:39:28.784 --> 01:39:35.208]  All citizens of planet Earth live in a land of confusion right now.
[01:39:35.208 --> 01:39:39.191]  We deserve to live in a world where we know what the hell's going on, okay?
[01:39:39.191 --> 01:39:48.938]  I've got stories here, stack after stack, of local CBS affiliates doing independent investigations and finding mass amounts of voter fraud, okay?
[01:39:48.938 --> 01:39:49.418]  But then,
[01:39:50.464 --> 01:39:59.151]  Just two days ago, CBS News National, Donald Trump citing no evidence claims millions of people voted illegally.
[01:39:59.151 --> 01:40:09.460]  Your own network, your own independent investigations is covering voter fraud, and then you're going to print out a story saying Donald Trump cites no evidence.
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:11.842]  Why do I have to live in a land of confusion?
[01:40:11.842 --> 01:40:13.943]  Why do people have to live in a land of confusion, David?
[01:40:13.943 --> 01:40:16.926]  And ultimately, I think that's what we are trying to stop.
[01:40:17.506 --> 01:40:18.226]  At Infowars.
[01:40:18.226 --> 01:40:20.067]  You can say whatever you want about us.
[01:40:20.067 --> 01:40:22.628]  You can put whatever monikers you want about us.
[01:40:22.628 --> 01:40:24.369]  We might even get it wrong sometimes.
[01:40:24.369 --> 01:40:25.269]  But I'll tell you what.
[01:40:25.269 --> 01:40:28.531]  We are sick and tired of living in the land of confusion.
[01:40:28.531 --> 01:40:30.212]  I want to know what the hell is going on.
[01:40:30.212 --> 01:40:32.112]  I want to know why dead people are voting.
[01:40:32.112 --> 01:40:34.253]  I want to know why Donald Trump is claiming millions.
[01:40:34.253 --> 01:40:39.196]  I want to know why CBS is saying that there's no evidence and then their own independent investigations find evidence.
[01:40:39.196 --> 01:40:40.536]  That's what I want to figure out.
[01:40:40.536 --> 01:40:42.377]  That's what we at Infowars want to figure out, David.
[01:40:42.637 --> 01:40:53.243]  Well that's the disconnect between the local reporters who are actually reporting news that happened and then the propaganda reporting which is like what we used to beam into the former Soviet Union with Voice of America.
[01:40:53.243 --> 01:41:05.611]  Remember it's just a few years ago they said hey we're gonna make it legal to do that same kind of propaganda reporting by the government into the United States and of course they don't really need that they've got their own false media but I want you're talking about the
[01:41:06.071 --> 01:41:07.932]  Isn't Twitter's stock, like, dying already?
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:30.941]  I mean, you already banned Milo.
[01:41:30.941 --> 01:41:32.362]  Oh, this is crazy.
[01:41:32.362 --> 01:41:35.003]  They would ban Donald Trump's account.
[01:41:35.003 --> 01:41:40.667]  Yeah, this is going to be the end of these people, because the more obvious they become about this.
[01:41:40.667 --> 01:41:43.728]  First of all, he put Twitter on the map.
[01:41:43.728 --> 01:41:45.409]  Everybody started talking about Twitter.
[01:41:45.409 --> 01:41:48.591]  I got more involved with Twitter, frankly, because of Donald Trump.
[01:41:48.591 --> 01:41:55.795]  I wasn't really very involved with Twitter, because I thought it was a great way for people to interact, and I like the way the news feed is there.
[01:41:55.795 --> 01:41:56.475]  But you know what?
[01:41:56.475 --> 01:41:57.216]  They don't have
[01:41:57.876 --> 01:41:59.437]  A monopoly on information.
[01:41:59.437 --> 01:42:01.738]  And they're going to lose what they do have.
[01:42:01.738 --> 01:42:04.560]  They're delegitimizing what they're doing if they ban Donald Trump.
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:07.481]  They're going to really shoot themselves in the head.
[01:42:07.481 --> 01:42:08.182]  This is just amazing.
[01:42:08.182 --> 01:42:13.585]  You know, these people hate Donald Trump so much and they don't even understand they're handing him the world on a silver platter.
[01:42:13.965 --> 01:42:14.185]  Yeah.
[01:42:14.185 --> 01:42:19.792]  Don't you understand discredited fake news that all Donald Trump has to do is start his own news network and he defeats you?
[01:42:19.792 --> 01:42:23.336]  Don't you understand that all Donald Trump has to do is start his own social network and he defeats you?
[01:42:23.336 --> 01:42:29.323]  I mean you are handing the entire world on a platter to Donald Trump and you don't even realize it.
[01:42:29.323 --> 01:42:33.307]  That's how blinded you are by your hate for the man.
[01:42:33.307 --> 01:42:33.608]  That's amazing.
[01:42:33.908 --> 01:42:34.348]  That's amazing.
[01:42:34.348 --> 01:42:40.414]  But of course the fake news was about the Russian involvement, but there are very provocative things that are happening.
[01:42:40.414 --> 01:42:52.146]  I want to get Alex Jones' report about something that's been a very provocative statement by Turkey's Erdogan talking about how they're really going to war with Syria and Russia.
[01:42:52.146 --> 01:42:55.149]  Here's that report.
[01:42:55.149 --> 01:42:56.110]  Massive wars.
[01:42:57.955 --> 01:43:02.618]  Are something that most people never believe can actually happen until it actually happens.
[01:43:02.618 --> 01:43:06.001]  Like Mount Vesuvius erupting or Mount St.
[01:43:06.001 --> 01:43:06.841]  Helens.
[01:43:06.841 --> 01:43:12.826]  Those sleeping mountains seem like they're dead until they awaken and rain down fiery death.
[01:43:12.826 --> 01:43:14.467]  Most geopolitical analysts
[01:43:21.271 --> 01:43:28.116]  Trump being elected obviously took the defense condition from 2 and 3 back to 5, back to the lowest condition.
[01:43:28.116 --> 01:43:31.119]  And there is some detente going on.
[01:43:31.119 --> 01:43:39.185]  But Erdogan, who has had all sorts of problems in Turkey, he basically staged his last election.
[01:43:39.185 --> 01:43:40.306]  That's admitted.
[01:43:40.306 --> 01:43:41.607]  There's been attempts to overthrow him.
[01:43:41.607 --> 01:43:42.708]  There's been multiple coup attempts.
[01:43:42.708 --> 01:43:43.548]  Everybody knows about that.
[01:43:44.489 --> 01:43:47.591]  He came out yesterday, and this has gotten no attention in Western press.
[01:43:47.591 --> 01:43:50.513]  Michael Snyder wrote about it for Economic Collapse Blog.
[01:43:50.513 --> 01:43:52.315]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:43:52.315 --> 01:43:55.097]  And if you read his headline, it's not sensational.
[01:43:55.097 --> 01:43:56.097]  It's what's happening.
[01:43:56.097 --> 01:43:58.159]  Turkey's declared war on Syria.
[01:43:58.159 --> 01:44:01.401]  Does this mean that World War III is about to erupt in the Middle East?
[01:44:01.401 --> 01:44:03.783]  Now, let me explain what this really means.
[01:44:03.783 --> 01:44:09.687]  It actually means war in the Middle East between NATO and Russia has been declared by NATO.
[01:44:09.687 --> 01:44:11.989]  But it doesn't mean that that physical war has started yet.
[01:44:13.336 --> 01:44:19.037]  But it's kind of like the horse's gates open, and the buzzer sounds, and the gates open.
[01:44:19.037 --> 01:44:20.698]  So he's a NATO member.
[01:44:20.698 --> 01:44:29.460]  There's a defense pact with all the NATO nations, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, signed up for World War II, that if one nation attacks, they will all back that nation.
[01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:32.240]  Or if one of those nations is attacked, they will back that nation.
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:34.521]  So you've got Turkey, gateway to the West.
[01:44:36.147 --> 01:44:38.890]  Basically playing chicken with the world or holding the world hostage.
[01:44:38.890 --> 01:44:50.001]  He came out two days ago and said, if you don't accept millions more migrants and give me millions more dollars and give me more power in the EU, I'm going to just let millions of more Middle Easterners come in.
[01:44:50.968 --> 01:44:51.309]  I think?
[01:45:10.008 --> 01:45:14.111]  But now, this is in the mainline state-run Turkish news.
[01:45:14.111 --> 01:45:15.732]  I mean, I didn't just believe this article.
[01:45:15.732 --> 01:45:17.233]  I went and looked it up.
[01:45:17.233 --> 01:45:20.455]  They've rolled in with tanks, fighter bombers in the north.
[01:45:20.455 --> 01:45:27.019]  And they say, quote, we are going to overthrow the tyrant Bashir al-Assad.
[01:45:27.019 --> 01:45:29.761]  And has declared war on Syria officially.
[01:45:29.761 --> 01:45:31.802]  Now, he does that because that triggers NATO.
[01:45:31.802 --> 01:45:34.964]  Now, who's got a defense agreement with Syria?
[01:45:34.964 --> 01:45:36.325]  And who's been invited in by Syria?
[01:45:36.325 --> 01:45:37.666]  And who didn't start this five years ago?
[01:45:37.666 --> 01:45:37.906]  Russia.
[01:45:38.769 --> 01:45:39.949]  I'm not picking sides here, folks.
[01:45:39.949 --> 01:45:41.250]  This is crazy.
[01:45:41.250 --> 01:45:43.010]  Russia has a lot of troops on the ground.
[01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:45.011]  They've got several airbases.
[01:45:45.011 --> 01:45:48.171]  They have been carpet-bombing al-Qaeda, and they've turned the tide.
[01:45:48.171 --> 01:45:51.092]  They're kicking al-Qaeda, known as ISIS, out of the country.
[01:45:51.092 --> 01:45:52.152]  They're losing on every front.
[01:45:52.152 --> 01:45:53.493]  That's in the news.
[01:45:53.493 --> 01:45:53.833]  U.S.
[01:45:53.833 --> 01:46:03.695]  forces are finally being allowed, because Obama's been embarrassed into it, to engage on the ground and push out the rest of the ISIS people.
[01:46:03.695 --> 01:46:04.795]  We have thousands of U.S.
[01:46:04.795 --> 01:46:06.416]  soldiers there, most of them special forces.
[01:46:07.532 --> 01:46:11.234]  What is it, like 10 of them died just in the last few weeks?
[01:46:11.234 --> 01:46:12.934]  I mean, there was like six in one week.
[01:46:12.934 --> 01:46:14.055]  This is a major war.
[01:46:14.055 --> 01:46:19.037]  We should get Colonel Schaefer on this week or next week to talk more about it as much as he can.
[01:46:19.037 --> 01:46:26.640]  And Ergun, who's been caught buying the oil, they stole out of Syria, and his son, the rest of them, working with ISIS.
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:28.321]  He's now really pissed.
[01:46:28.321 --> 01:46:30.422]  Threatening even bigger migrant floods into Europe.
[01:46:32.122 --> 01:46:38.925]  Threatening to join Russia two weeks ago, then pulling back, now threatening war with Russia.
[01:46:38.925 --> 01:46:42.967]  A state of war between NATO and Russia has basically been declared.
[01:46:42.967 --> 01:46:51.391]  If you look at the treaties, and that's exactly how the one that depended on others a few months ago said, that this could lead to World War III and it's the biggest tender box in the world.
[01:46:51.391 --> 01:46:56.974]  If they use the example of Turkey, let's just get another plane shot down and then respond.
[01:46:56.974 --> 01:46:59.695]  Or if Turkey was to invade and then the Russians have to back up,
[01:47:01.755 --> 01:47:02.775]  Which they've said they'll do.
[01:47:02.775 --> 01:47:05.556]  And again, I go back to this.
[01:47:05.556 --> 01:47:09.418]  I wouldn't be saying do this if Syria was run by bad people.
[01:47:09.418 --> 01:47:11.999]  Because it's their own nation, I don't want to start World War III.
[01:47:11.999 --> 01:47:13.979]  We're not an empire, we're not supposed to be.
[01:47:13.979 --> 01:47:16.861]  Even though Karl Rove says we are.
[01:47:16.861 --> 01:47:18.641]  And we're, quote, history's actors.
[01:47:18.641 --> 01:47:25.144]  Okay, we're history's actors backing radical jihadis out of Saudi Arabia, taking over Africa and the Middle East, and menacing Russia.
[01:47:25.144 --> 01:47:26.984]  This is totally immoral.
[01:47:26.984 --> 01:47:28.505]  And the West started all this.
[01:47:30.029 --> 01:47:38.952]  And when there are Somalis and Syrians and other scab people in grocery stores and shopping malls and colleges, we're told they're not jihadis and don't say that and you're a racist.
[01:47:38.952 --> 01:47:42.533]  It's all about breaking our will and conditioning us to put up with anything.
[01:47:42.533 --> 01:47:45.694]  So, here's your real headline.
[01:47:45.694 --> 01:47:52.556]  NATO is now in a declared war with Russia.
[01:47:52.556 --> 01:47:55.117]  It's worse than Turkey has declared war on Syria.
[01:47:56.149 --> 01:48:00.671]  Because when Turkey declares war on Syria, that activates the defense pacts above.
[01:48:00.671 --> 01:48:02.912]  That's a fact.
[01:48:02.912 --> 01:48:05.793]  Now, the New York Times will call that fake news.
[01:48:05.793 --> 01:48:10.035]  The same ones that lied us into war with Iraq when it was Saudi Arabia that bare-minded on this on 9-11.
[01:48:10.035 --> 01:48:13.677]  The same ones that told us, you know, that Hillary, we had a 97% chance of winning.
[01:48:13.677 --> 01:48:14.777]  No.
[01:48:14.777 --> 01:48:15.097]  No.
[01:48:15.097 --> 01:48:16.098]  The main analyst
[01:48:17.219 --> 01:48:20.761]  Agreed that this is now a state of war, okay?
[01:48:20.761 --> 01:48:24.363]  And that there would be this type of event that could trigger it at any time.
[01:48:24.363 --> 01:48:26.064]  So let's get some attention on this.
[01:48:26.064 --> 01:48:27.724]  Let's get this covered in the news.
[01:48:27.724 --> 01:48:29.105]  Call your newspapers, folks.
[01:48:29.105 --> 01:48:32.367]  Call your TV stations, your congressmen and women, and say do your job.
[01:48:33.427 --> 01:48:36.168]  Pull Turkey back from this.
[01:48:36.168 --> 01:48:40.430]  We've got nuclear weapons, by the way, in Turkey at two different airbases, and we've given them so many weapons.
[01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:43.491]  They've got one of the largest militaries.
[01:48:43.491 --> 01:48:44.812]  I know they're in the top ten, folks.
[01:48:44.812 --> 01:48:46.712]  I mean, they're big.
[01:48:46.712 --> 01:48:49.253]  And they are the former center of the Ottoman Empire.
[01:48:49.253 --> 01:48:50.654]  Turks will fight.
[01:48:50.654 --> 01:48:55.696]  God, look at World War I. This is a serious situation.
[01:48:59.190 --> 01:49:05.057]  We should have kept Turkey Christian, Constantinople, but the religion of peace took it over.
[01:49:05.057 --> 01:49:07.701]  We're not migrating and taking over their countries, we're taking over our countries.
[01:49:08.735 --> 01:49:11.417]  We're paying for it for over a thousand years.
[01:49:11.417 --> 01:49:15.460]  Nothing against Muslims in general, but man, I'm not trying to conquer you.
[01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:16.601]  So stop trying to conquer us.
[01:49:16.601 --> 01:49:17.682]  And he says that.
[01:49:17.682 --> 01:49:19.683]  He says we're going to conquer you with migration.
[01:49:19.683 --> 01:49:30.952]  Go read the articles on InfoWars.com and also hit your knees and pray to God that we continue to have detente and push back from what is the break of a chain reaction that could lead to a wider worldwide war.
[01:49:30.952 --> 01:49:35.235]  Because the Russians hit back, NATO hits back, and then it goes from unconventional
[01:49:36.983 --> 01:49:41.704]  Asymmetrical warfare to conventional warfare, and then it goes to nuclear warfare.
[01:49:41.704 --> 01:49:42.624]  That's how this works.
[01:49:42.624 --> 01:49:55.167]  It escalates from ground war and guerrilla war to conventional mainline armies, and then it gets, in a matter of days usually, escalated, experts believe, up into thermal nuclear war.
[01:49:55.167 --> 01:50:01.028]  Infowars.com forward slash show, since the show is massively intensifying against us and others.
[01:50:01.028 --> 01:50:03.409]  So please don't take these videos and articles for granted.
[01:50:03.409 --> 01:50:04.589]  We don't take you for granted.
[01:50:05.691 --> 01:50:12.416]  We're fighting the globalists here in America for our own sovereignty, and we're fighting to stop the globalists from starting World War III.
[01:50:12.416 --> 01:50:14.598]  So this is a new kind of war.
[01:50:14.598 --> 01:50:17.721]  It's an information war that we're winning.
[01:50:17.721 --> 01:50:25.487]  We've got to use the info war and truth, our secret weapon, against the globalists because they want a global crisis ahead of the economic collapse they're engineering.
[01:50:25.487 --> 01:50:26.387]  And that's very, very clear.
[01:50:26.387 --> 01:50:28.809]  So we are in incredible times.
[01:50:28.809 --> 01:50:29.670]  And Donald Trump's right.
[01:50:29.670 --> 01:50:33.213]  The answer to this is Americanism, not globalism.
[01:50:35.996 --> 01:50:45.105]  Absolutely, because it's globalism that has given us these ideas of regime change, Owen, and ISIS is our surrogate in that area.
[01:50:45.105 --> 01:50:51.991]  And of course, today, they just announced, the Syrian government announced that it had liberated a major road going into Aleppo, so they can now bring aid in there.
[01:50:51.991 --> 01:50:59.518]  Is it a good thing to have ISIS in control of that area, where they're cutting people's heads off, committing those kinds of atrocities in the areas that they control?
[01:50:59.518 --> 01:51:00.839]  They are our surrogate.
[01:51:00.839 --> 01:51:01.640]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:07.104]  In my twenties, I abused stimulants and anabolic steroids to the point where my adrenal glands were shot.
[01:51:07.104 --> 01:51:10.186]  I suffered from extreme fatigue and an inability to handle stress.
[01:51:10.186 --> 01:51:16.891]  For over six years, I have been taking adrenal supplements including herbs, glandulars, vitamin C, and vitamin B5.
[01:51:16.891 --> 01:51:20.834]  All these supplements did was treat the symptoms and produced only minimal results.
[01:51:20.834 --> 01:51:25.998]  Now, just after one month on Synergy One and ADR Medix, I truly feel rejuvenated.
[01:51:26.198 --> 01:51:33.060]  I have never felt such relaxation before from any adrenal supplement as I did just 10 minutes after taking ADR Medix.
[01:51:33.060 --> 01:51:37.381]  I then noticed Synergy One made me wake up rested and with much more energy.
[01:51:37.381 --> 01:51:40.442]  No more hungover, groggy feeling upon arising.
[01:51:40.442 --> 01:51:48.525]  I had almost considered going to another country for stem cell therapy as a last resort, but now I truly feel rejuvenated on Synergy One and ADR Medix.
[01:51:49.025 --> 01:51:51.289]  Success happens with synergistic nutrition.

[01:53:00.011 --> 01:53:00.832]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:53:00.832 --> 01:53:02.633]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:53:02.633 --> 01:53:04.274]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:53:04.274 --> 01:53:07.116]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:53:07.116 --> 01:53:09.397]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:53:09.397 --> 01:53:13.900]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:53:13.900 --> 01:53:17.863]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:53:17.863 --> 01:53:21.625]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[01:53:21.625 --> 01:53:21.946]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:53:21.946 --> 01:53:23.687]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:35.242]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset Jeans, here to wish you all a Merry Christmas.

[01:53:53.167 --> 01:53:57.388]  Thanks for keeping our American dream alive, the original Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:54:08.579 --> 01:54:09.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:14.085]  I'm David Knight here with Owen Schroeder and of course in the next hour we're going to be joined by Roger Stone.
[01:54:14.085 --> 01:54:19.390]  And Owen, he's going to have a lot to say about the cabinet picks, the transition team.
[01:54:19.390 --> 01:54:21.892]  There's been a lot of picks in the last 24 to 48 hours.
[01:54:21.892 --> 01:54:27.418]  One of the things he said also about the attack on the Electoral College and them trying to
[01:54:28.198 --> 01:54:37.186]  Switch the people who are going to go to the Electoral College as they try to take the delegates to the RNC and say, well, okay, this is what the people voted for, but we want you to override that.
[01:54:37.186 --> 01:54:45.773]  These are the same people who now are vociferously calling for direct popular elections, except when the people make the wrong mistake, as they say.
[01:54:45.773 --> 01:54:49.897]  And when the people make the wrong mistake, they want these people to undo that for them.
[01:54:50.357 --> 01:54:52.698]  And Roger Stone said, well, we're tracking this intensely.
[01:54:52.698 --> 01:54:58.742]  In an email, he said he's convinced that this is going to fail, but it is the dying gasp of the established order.
[01:54:58.742 --> 01:55:10.268]  So he's going to be joining us in the next hour and in the fourth hour, I'm sure he's going to have a lot to say about the pushback against the actual election results, as well as what's on the transition team.
[01:55:10.268 --> 01:55:12.590]  Before we get back to the news, I just want to remind people that today
[01:55:13.250 --> 01:55:13.931]  We're good to go.
[01:55:29.262 --> 01:55:32.704]  We have 30 to 40% off select storable foods.
[01:55:32.704 --> 01:55:38.127]  That's a 25 year life on these made in the USA non-GMO foods.
[01:55:38.127 --> 01:55:42.749]  The best packaging you're going to find anywhere and the best discounts that you're going to find anywhere.
[01:55:42.749 --> 01:55:43.609]  30 to 40% off and 50% off colloidal silver.
[01:55:47.111 --> 01:55:49.013]  A great time to stock up on that.
[01:55:49.013 --> 01:55:50.415]  It doesn't ever go bad.
[01:55:50.415 --> 01:55:53.057]  Okay, this is a perfect time to stock up on this.
[01:55:53.057 --> 01:55:56.421]  We've extended these sales, but today is the very last day.
[01:55:56.421 --> 01:56:07.292]  So, 30% off of nascent iodine and super male vitality, 50% off colloidal silver bullet, and 30 to 40% off select storable foods.
[01:56:07.292 --> 01:56:09.374]  This is the last day we've extended that.
[01:56:09.374 --> 01:56:10.054]  Now, Owen,
[01:56:11.276 --> 01:56:16.078]  You were just talking about the cabinet picks and of course there was a dinner last night with Mitt Romney.
[01:56:16.078 --> 01:56:22.841]  You were saying during the break that Mitt Romney was unfortunately looking very happy when he got out of that meeting.
[01:56:22.841 --> 01:56:26.422]  I'm just trying to figure out how a guy like Mitt Romney operates.
[01:56:26.422 --> 01:56:29.404]  Just months ago he was calling Donald Trump a con man.
[01:56:29.404 --> 01:56:30.064]  Well of course it was
[01:56:30.484 --> 01:56:37.709]  What, I guess four years ago he was saying how great Trump was when he wanted him to endorse him for president.
[01:56:37.709 --> 01:56:42.952]  Then he comes out and he says he's a total con man, he's a fraud, you know, this, that, and the other thing, character assassinates him.
[01:56:42.952 --> 01:56:51.498]  Now Trump offers him an olive branch, sends him to dinner, and here he back is, he's, Trump's great, I had a great meeting, what a productive meeting it was, I'm looking forward to talking to Donald again.
[01:56:51.498 --> 01:56:55.260]  So I just don't understand what is going on with Mitt Romney.
[01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:56.962]  But as far as Donald Trump is concerned,
[01:56:57.967 --> 01:57:01.148]  He appoints Mitch McConnell's wife.
[01:57:01.148 --> 01:57:04.090]  He's got Goldman Sachs now getting an appointment.
[01:57:04.090 --> 01:57:07.031]  And, you know, I don't know what his plan is for Mitt Romney.
[01:57:07.031 --> 01:57:08.412]  Maybe two for him.
[01:57:08.412 --> 01:57:09.452]  Maybe two.
[01:57:09.452 --> 01:57:10.713]  Who knows what he's going to do with Mitt Romney.
[01:57:10.713 --> 01:57:12.293]  But this isn't really draining the swamp.
[01:57:12.293 --> 01:57:15.375]  I mean, this is not the draining of the swamp that I think the American people wanted.
[01:57:15.375 --> 01:57:17.976]  Now, we're going to keep a close eye on Donald Trump.
[01:57:17.976 --> 01:57:20.637]  That's just what we do here at Infowars.com.
[01:57:20.637 --> 01:57:21.878]  But it'll be interesting to see
[01:57:22.850 --> 01:57:27.233]  I mean, I'm just trying to figure out what move he's really making here with Mitt Romney.
[01:57:27.233 --> 01:57:28.754]  What is behind the curtain here?
[01:57:28.754 --> 01:57:36.479]  Because you know he didn't just, we've heard what he did with the media, you know he didn't just let Mitt Romney come into his office and didn't give him a tongue lashing?
[01:57:36.479 --> 01:57:40.221]  Yeah, I was hoping that instead of frog legs it was going to be crow on the menu, but
[01:57:40.968 --> 01:57:44.869]  I guess he's trying to put out an olive branch to the Republican establishment.
[01:57:44.869 --> 01:57:48.931]  I thought he did enough with Reince Priebus, but of course, he's the one that is making the moves.
[01:57:48.931 --> 01:57:56.413]  And as they say, it was Bismarck that said, you know, in politics, you don't want to see the laws being made anymore than you want to see how sausage is made.
[01:57:56.413 --> 01:58:03.276]  And unfortunately, we're now seeing how sausages have been made because we have this 24-7 media.
[01:58:03.276 --> 01:58:07.337]  They've even got a TV camera set up on the elevator there in Trump Tower.
[01:58:07.637 --> 01:58:12.360]  So we're looking at all this and we're trying to read the tea leaves, we're trying to look at this.
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:13.261]  It's difficult.
[01:58:13.261 --> 01:58:21.666]  I think we need to give him the benefit of the doubt when we look at his pick for Treasury Secretary, Mnuchin, even though he's got a Goldman Sachs background that's strong in that.
[01:58:21.666 --> 01:58:25.449]  He did come out today and he went down the list of Trump's priorities.
[01:58:25.449 --> 01:58:27.270]  That's very important that they're on the same page.
[01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:28.691]  I don't know if Mitt Romney is or not.
[01:58:28.691 --> 01:58:31.853]  We're going to be talking about that with Roger Stone in the next hour.
[01:58:31.853 --> 01:58:32.313]  Stay with us.
[01:58:32.313 --> 01:58:32.934]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:40.919 --> 01:58:44.183]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.183 --> 01:58:46.345]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.234 --> 01:58:54.278]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[01:58:54.278 --> 01:58:55.419]  Charlie Daniels.
[01:58:55.419 --> 01:58:57.280]  He's always loved America.
[01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:59.082]  He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[01:58:59.082 --> 01:59:01.924]  Let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21.
[01:59:01.924 --> 01:59:06.088]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[01:59:06.088 --> 01:59:10.051]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective.
[01:59:10.051 --> 01:59:11.973]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[01:59:11.973 --> 01:59:13.114]  They're gonna be coming after you, Gunn.
[01:59:13.114 --> 01:59:13.755]  Oh, yeah.
[01:59:13.755 --> 01:59:15.977]  I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[01:59:16.517 --> 01:59:17.479]  At all.
[01:59:17.479 --> 01:59:18.540]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:20.723]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:59:20.723 --> 01:59:21.905]  It's time to ride, boys.
[01:59:21.905 --> 01:59:23.908]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[01:59:23.908 --> 01:59:29.956]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[01:59:29.956 --> 01:59:31.819]  And beef was for supper.
[01:59:32.539 --> 01:59:35.041]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:59:35.041 --> 01:59:36.842]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[01:59:36.842 --> 01:59:38.523]  DVDs now available.
[01:59:38.523 --> 01:59:42.886]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[01:59:42.886 --> 01:59:46.588]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[01:59:46.588 --> 01:59:48.930]  Revelation, themovie.info.
[01:59:48.930 --> 01:59:52.772]  Let's fix it.
[01:59:52.772 --> 01:59:55.394]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:03.786 --> 02:00:06.310]  I have scanned it.
[02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:09.015]  The government wants you to view them as God.
[02:00:09.015 --> 02:00:13.883]  To do that, they attempt to reproduce the very attributes of God.
[02:00:15.456 --> 02:00:20.997]  God, Vermint, wants you to see it as omniscient, knowing everything about you.
[02:00:20.997 --> 02:00:24.918]  Omnipresent, its constant presence on the media.
[02:00:24.918 --> 02:00:28.799]  Cameras watching you everywhere, on your phone, on your computer.
[02:00:28.799 --> 02:00:34.080]  And as omnipotent, presenting itself as all-powerful and irresistible.
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:39.081]  This is why the police are becoming increasingly brutal and publicly taking away with them.
[02:00:39.081 --> 02:00:43.722]  This is the fog for what I would liken to Spectre, these global corporations to just take over.
[02:00:44.423 --> 02:00:45.063]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:00:45.063 --> 02:00:56.266]  And what it really does is it gives them all that power, having all that knowledge, then they now know how or who they have to deal with in their societies to be able to control the outcomes.
[02:00:56.266 --> 02:01:03.187]  That's really what I've been saying for several years, is that their whole idea is population control.
[02:01:03.187 --> 02:01:07.809]  And in order to do that, you have to have knowledge about the population, and that's what this is giving them.
[02:01:07.809 --> 02:01:13.230]  A security clearance to even be able to function and have a job, even in the private sector, I mean, this is beyond Hitler's...
[02:01:14.490 --> 02:01:16.732]  Best dreams, isn't it, sir?
[02:01:16.732 --> 02:01:20.395]  Oh, it's well beyond Orwell's in 1984, too.
[02:01:20.395 --> 02:01:31.744]  I mean, it's just total... It's getting into not only the things that you're doing and who you're working with and who you do those things with, but also what you're thinking, and that's really where this is heading.
[02:01:31.744 --> 02:01:40.792]  And then openly blackmailing you to submit and do everything you're told, or they will lower your social score so you can't operate in society and can't travel.
[02:01:41.572 --> 02:01:46.516]  Yeah, and if they can't get to you, they'll get to somebody you care about, just like the KGB did.
[02:01:46.516 --> 02:01:55.363]  On December 1st, 2016, the spy state will slip a Fourth Amendment violating procedure into the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
[02:01:55.363 --> 02:01:57.604]  Notice the term procedure.
[02:01:57.604 --> 02:02:02.448]  According to an article released by the Electronic Frontier Foundation back in April,
[02:02:02.568 --> 02:02:06.793]  The amendment to Rule 41 isn't procedural at all.
[02:02:06.793 --> 02:02:12.138]  It creates new avenues for government hacking that were never approved by Congress.
[02:02:12.138 --> 02:02:20.147]  The proposal would grant a judge the ability to issue a warrant to remotely access, search, seize, or copy data when the district
[02:02:20.327 --> 02:02:34.634]  where the media or information is located has been concealed through technological means or when the media are on protected computers that have been damaged without authorization and are located in five or more districts.
[02:02:34.634 --> 02:02:40.857]  It would grant this authority to any judge in any district where activities related to the crime may have occurred.
[02:02:40.857 --> 02:02:49.161]  The first part of this change would grant authority to practically any judge to issue a search warrant to remotely access, seize, or copy data
[02:02:49.281 --> 02:02:55.823]  ...relevant to a crime when a computer was using privacy-protective tools to safeguard one's location.
[02:02:55.823 --> 02:03:08.567]  All of those using a VPN service, or even those denying GPS location of their devices through a map app, for example, are subject to being implicated by the little-known procedural amendment.
[02:03:08.567 --> 02:03:12.929]  And while the federal hackers are hacking your device or computer with malware,
[02:03:13.209 --> 02:03:30.063]  Malicious hackers with far better experience hacking botnet devices will be hacking the federal government, causing any and all of your private data to be exposed simply because you were exercising your right to privacy, which is apparently a crime now.
[02:03:30.063 --> 02:03:33.666]  And all of it done with zero public debate.
[02:03:33.666 --> 02:03:42.573]  Two and a half weeks ago, it was discovered that there were 17 cell towers in the southwest, southeast actually, that were fake cell towers.
[02:03:43.213 --> 02:03:52.240]  Uh, they were, uh, rather than transmitting phone calls directly to who you were talking to, they were planting software on the devices that you were using to connect.
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:55.522]  Well, you don't have to actually put a cell tower beside the road or on top of the mountain.
[02:03:55.522 --> 02:03:59.225]  You can put it in the back of your car and put an antenna on the top of your car.
[02:03:59.725 --> 02:04:01.006]  And be anywhere.
[02:04:01.006 --> 02:04:04.129]  And they look and sound exactly like real cell towers.
[02:04:04.129 --> 02:04:07.431]  These devices are manufactured by the Harris Corporation.
[02:04:07.431 --> 02:04:09.553]  They're the only company that manufactures them.
[02:04:09.553 --> 02:04:18.460]  And they have a contract with all of their customers saying that the customer cannot talk about where they bought the equipment from or the fact that they own this equipment.
[02:04:19.113 --> 02:04:24.477]  Google was founded by the CIA and NSA on record 14 years ago.
[02:04:24.477 --> 02:04:27.319]  Apple is really a CIA front.
[02:04:27.319 --> 02:04:29.000]  Microsoft is pre-CIA.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.561]  It's an IBM front that actually created the CIA.
[02:04:31.561 --> 02:04:33.463]  You might want to look into that.
[02:04:33.463 --> 02:04:34.523]  Who set up IBM?
[02:04:34.523 --> 02:04:35.744]  What its goal was?
[02:04:35.744 --> 02:04:40.708]  World domination, master race, eugenics.
[02:04:40.708 --> 02:04:43.589]  IBM was probably the main funder of Hitler.
[02:04:43.589 --> 02:04:45.371]  If you're a new listener, that sounds crazy.
[02:04:45.371 --> 02:04:46.211]  Just please look it up.
[02:05:00.319 --> 02:05:12.269]  In yet another disgusting example of the crimes committed against Trump supporters, we have an article that's up on our website, written by Paul Joseph Watson, entitled, Navy Vets Home Vandalized, Torched by, quote, Anti-Trump Extremists.
[02:05:12.269 --> 02:05:15.451]  Now, I'm talking about a Navy veteran with two young children at home.
[02:05:15.451 --> 02:05:21.476]  His house was vandalized with anti-Trump graffiti and racial slurs, both inside and out, before they torched the place.
[02:05:21.716 --> 02:05:27.401]  And yet another shocking example of anti-Trump hate crimes sweeping the country since we've seen Trump's victory.
[02:05:27.401 --> 02:05:35.347]  Now, the veteran Matthew Smith, who flies three flags in front of his house in Plant City, Florida, which are the American flag, the POW flag, and the U.S.
[02:05:35.347 --> 02:05:38.950]  Navy flag, says that he was targeted for his, quote, political beliefs.
[02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:40.952]  We should be figuring out our problems together.
[02:05:41.152 --> 02:05:49.561]  Now the word cracker was spray painted in his house and this suggests that the crime was racially motivated, most likely carried out by Black Lives Matter supporters.
[02:05:49.561 --> 02:05:56.389]  To make matters worse, Smith's home is in foreclosure and they have no insurance to cover the belongings that were utterly destroyed in this fire.
[02:05:56.389 --> 02:05:59.292]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:02.761]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[02:06:02.761 --> 02:06:04.921]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[02:06:04.921 --> 02:06:13.743]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house, like small refrigerators, to keep your food from spoiling.
[02:06:13.743 --> 02:06:16.263]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[02:06:16.263 --> 02:06:22.124]  It's mobile, to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[02:06:22.124 --> 02:06:25.505]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity.
[02:06:25.865 --> 02:06:29.287]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[02:06:29.287 --> 02:06:30.307]  A true innovation.
[02:06:30.307 --> 02:06:32.388]  I have never seen anything like this.
[02:06:32.388 --> 02:06:34.089]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[02:06:34.089 --> 02:06:36.631]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[02:06:36.631 --> 02:06:40.813]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[02:06:40.813 --> 02:06:42.914]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.
[02:06:42.914 --> 02:06:44.935]  That's privatepowergrid.com.

[02:08:01.983 --> 02:08:09.990]  They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[02:08:09.990 --> 02:08:16.055]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[02:08:16.055 --> 02:08:19.057]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.028 --> 02:08:29.431]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, but I'm not going to be your guest host this hour and the next.
[02:08:29.431 --> 02:08:34.874]  Our guest host is going to be Roger Stone with Stone Cold Truth, and I'm anxious to see what he's going to talk about.
[02:08:34.874 --> 02:08:39.176]  He's got several guests that are lined up, and of course there's been a lot of news in the last 24 hours.
[02:08:39.176 --> 02:08:47.740]  We've seen Donald Trump's pick for Treasury, his pick for Commerce, we've seen his pick for Health and Human Services, which is going to have a big effect on Obamacare.
[02:08:47.740 --> 02:08:50.042]  So we've got the economy and
[02:08:51.242 --> 02:08:56.289]  How the Trump administration is shaping up to move the economy and jobs forward.
[02:08:56.289 --> 02:08:59.232]  Is that on the same track that Trump is going to be on?
[02:08:59.232 --> 02:09:04.859]  I think it is, but we'll see what Roger Stone has to say about this, what his take is on these issues.
[02:09:04.859 --> 02:09:07.122]  I'm anxious to see what he's going to be talking about.
[02:09:07.122 --> 02:09:08.324]  Roger, thank you for joining us.
[02:09:09.991 --> 02:09:11.872]  David, thank you very much.
[02:09:11.872 --> 02:09:16.595]  Let's face it, we have big shoes to fill here, filling in for Alex Jones.
[02:09:16.595 --> 02:09:17.675]  Yes.
[02:09:17.675 --> 02:09:19.557]  We're going to talk about a lot of exciting stuff today.
[02:09:19.557 --> 02:09:21.238]  I'm going to talk to St.
[02:09:21.238 --> 02:09:31.363]  John Hunt, the author, researcher, poet, musician, but also the son of legendary CIA operative E. Howard Hunt about Fidel Castro.
[02:09:32.244 --> 02:09:33.805]  We're going to talk about the country's history with Castro.
[02:09:33.805 --> 02:09:41.893]  We're going to talk to Jack Posobiec about security during Donald Trump's upcoming inauguration.
[02:09:41.893 --> 02:09:56.626]  We're going to expose the fraud of the Wisconsin recount, the fronting of Jill Stein for Hillary Clinton, and the last dying gasp by Hillary, in my opinion, to stay out of prison.
[02:09:57.427 --> 02:10:07.074]  We're going to visit with Sean Stone, author, filmmaker, son of legendary filmmaker Oliver Stone, about his projects.
[02:10:07.074 --> 02:10:20.124]  And we're going to visit with Kate Koptenko, who is a 16-year-old prodigy who made music videos that helped propel the election of Donald Trump.
[02:10:20.124 --> 02:10:22.486]  So we've got a full agenda.
[02:10:22.486 --> 02:10:26.489]  And I'm just delighted to be here again at InfoWars.com.
[02:10:26.829 --> 02:10:27.370]  Well, that's great.
[02:10:27.370 --> 02:10:31.733]  You know, when you're talking about Wisconsin, what is your take, Roger, on Pennsylvania?
[02:10:31.733 --> 02:10:47.066]  Because we saw this report, it was up on the Drudge Report, it was a quote from someone at the Board of Elections or the Secretary of State in Pennsylvania, I think it was actually the office, saying that Jill Stein had missed the deadline to file for a recount by a full week.
[02:10:47.066 --> 02:10:49.828]  I mean, isn't that decisive?
[02:10:49.828 --> 02:10:51.130]  And if that's the case,
[02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:59.536]  Even if they play their games and keep Wisconsin and Michigan out of the Electoral College, he's at 280 if he keeps Pennsylvania.
[02:10:59.536 --> 02:11:00.357]  What is your take on that?
[02:11:00.357 --> 02:11:01.357]  Is that going to hold?
[02:11:01.357 --> 02:11:10.084]  I know why the press is still talking about Jill Stein, and I know why Jill Stein is still doing this, but isn't that really the reality?
[02:11:10.084 --> 02:11:11.165]  Haven't they shut her down with that?
[02:11:12.537 --> 02:11:13.377]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:11:13.377 --> 02:11:21.961]  I mean, first of all, the Wisconsin recall or recount started yesterday with testimony from the Democrats.
[02:11:21.961 --> 02:11:22.742]  And it's ironic.
[02:11:22.742 --> 02:11:24.443]  This sounds vaguely familiar, David.
[02:11:24.443 --> 02:11:28.645]  They're saying these computerized voting machines can be hacked.
[02:11:29.925 --> 02:11:32.226]  Yeah, that was a conspiracy theory.
[02:11:32.226 --> 02:11:37.107]  They attacked me when I said that as a conspiracy theorist.
[02:11:37.107 --> 02:11:57.294]  You may also recall when Donald Trump wasn't willing to readily endorse the outcome of the election without knowing whether it had been fairly and honestly conducted, he was savagely attacked for tearing at the fabric of our democratic society, for undermining the underpinnings of our democratic system.
[02:11:57.754 --> 02:12:02.059]  Now, of course, Hillary Clinton is doing exactly that.
[02:12:02.059 --> 02:12:03.541]  The hypocrisy is pretty rich, isn't it?
[02:12:03.541 --> 02:12:07.666]  They think they can flush that all down the memory hole and it's just going to go away.
[02:12:07.666 --> 02:12:11.510]  I mean, we don't even have to go back and look at their statements on the internet.
[02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:12.311]  It was just a couple weeks.
[02:12:12.311 --> 02:12:13.232]  We all remember that.
[02:12:13.232 --> 02:12:14.254]  We don't have that bad a memory.
[02:12:15.472 --> 02:12:17.113]  Yeah, it's really extraordinary.
[02:12:17.113 --> 02:12:21.515]  Basically, what we learned yesterday in Wisconsin is the Democrats have nothing.
[02:12:21.515 --> 02:12:23.256]  They have a theory.
[02:12:23.256 --> 02:12:35.102]  It's the same theory that I put forward months ago, but can only be tested by comparing actual machine results with exit polling, of which, of course, they have none.
[02:12:35.102 --> 02:12:37.323]  So it's all conjecture.
[02:12:37.323 --> 02:12:43.126]  It's all based on a claim that the voting machines and the paper ballots
[02:12:44.247 --> 02:12:45.208]  Are not the same.
[02:12:45.208 --> 02:12:46.771]  The voting pattern is not the same.
[02:12:46.771 --> 02:12:48.814]  Well, of course they're not the same.
[02:12:48.814 --> 02:12:51.057]  Demographics explain this.
[02:12:51.057 --> 02:12:54.863]  The computerized voter machines are in urban areas.
[02:12:54.863 --> 02:12:58.748]  The paper ballots are more likely to be in rural areas.
[02:12:59.229 --> 02:13:05.854]  The fact that rural areas will vote differently than the big democratic urban areas is not surprising.
[02:13:05.854 --> 02:13:07.135]  So this is a fraud.
[02:13:07.135 --> 02:13:09.096]  It's a waste of the taxpayers' time.
[02:13:09.096 --> 02:13:19.744]  And later on in the show, I'm going to reveal a petition that folks can sign to knock off the phony recounts.
[02:13:19.744 --> 02:13:26.168]  Because without Pennsylvania, as you point out, and without Michigan, where I think they are unlikely to succeed,
[02:13:26.969 --> 02:13:28.070]  They have bupkis.
[02:13:28.070 --> 02:13:29.391]  They have nothing.
[02:13:29.391 --> 02:13:30.331]  Yeah.
[02:13:30.331 --> 02:13:31.672]  Yeah, of course you saw this coming.
[02:13:31.672 --> 02:13:33.654]  You started Stop the Steal a long time ago.
[02:13:33.654 --> 02:13:42.620]  You knew that there were going to be, if it had been a real close election, and it really isn't, you knew that it was going to pull these kind of shenanigans.
[02:13:42.620 --> 02:13:45.722]  So this is nothing new, but it needs to be pushed back against.
[02:13:45.722 --> 02:13:46.603]  And we do really need
[02:13:47.183 --> 02:13:54.528]  That's a real problem and people on both sides of the aisle need to understand that and do something about it, but that's not what their goal is in this, and we all understand what their goal is.
[02:14:11.465 --> 02:14:12.145]  Agreed.
[02:14:12.145 --> 02:14:14.047]  Great to be back here at InfoWars.
[02:14:14.047 --> 02:14:15.948]  I'm going to let you take this, Roger.
[02:14:15.948 --> 02:14:18.149]  Thank you for joining us and thank you for guest hosting.
[02:14:18.149 --> 02:14:21.871]  I'm really anxious to hear these guests that you've got.
[02:14:21.871 --> 02:14:24.773]  Me too.
[02:14:24.773 --> 02:14:34.959]  So, we are going to revisit the entire question of the recount.
[02:14:34.959 --> 02:14:36.940]  We're going to look very closely at
[02:14:38.968 --> 02:15:03.832]  uh... the legal process in wisconsin and michigan uh... in pennsylvania a little later in the show he's coming up uh... saint john hunt uh... who is a very interesting fellow in his own right saint john is an author uh... a poet uh... musician a singer-songwriter uh... and of course he is the son of the legendary
[02:15:04.944 --> 02:15:05.705]  C.I.A.
[02:15:05.705 --> 02:15:12.708]  agent E. Howard Hunt, later infamously one of the Watergate burglars.
[02:15:12.708 --> 02:15:12.948]  St.
[02:15:12.948 --> 02:15:26.595]  John joins us today because he has a special knowledge and history regarding Fidel Castro and this country's involvement with Castro since the fifties.
[02:15:26.595 --> 02:15:32.999]  Now, it is interesting to me that the mainstream media continues to try to depict
[02:15:34.718 --> 02:15:57.728]  Fidel Castro is some kind of dashing, romantic, modern-day Robin Hood, when in fact he was a murderous thug, a mass murderer for that matter, an oppressor of Christians and gays and others, and that Castro was running and is still running under his brother's regime, a gulag.
[02:15:58.308 --> 02:16:08.614]  Where there is no freedom of speech, while there is no freedom of assembly, while there is no freedom of religion, while there is no freedom of expression.
[02:16:08.614 --> 02:16:11.756]  So, joining me, hopefully on the line, is St.
[02:16:11.756 --> 02:16:12.357]  John Hunt.
[02:16:12.357 --> 02:16:12.557]  St.
[02:16:12.557 --> 02:16:14.018]  John, welcome to InfoWars.
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:15.860]  Thank you, Roger.
[02:16:15.860 --> 02:16:20.461]  It's good to be back at InfoWars, and thank you for having me, and thank all your listeners as well.
[02:16:20.461 --> 02:16:27.683]  I just wanted to add something about your take on Castro, and of course, I did a little fact-checking myself.
[02:16:27.683 --> 02:16:39.846]  There's an article in the Wall Street Journal recently called, Accounting Castro's Victims, and it's based on the work of Professor Armando Lago, and he places a number approaching 100,000
[02:16:41.607 --> 02:16:48.428]  Deaths, murders as a direct result of Fidel Castro's oppressive regime there.
[02:16:48.428 --> 02:17:08.212]  So, you know, to those people that have glorified and somewhat romanticized Castro as a seeker of truth and freedom and some sort of visionary, he may have been that at times, certainly early, early on in his career when he was liberating Cuba from the oppressive regime.
[02:17:09.092 --> 02:17:18.541]  That the Batista had been running there, which was working hand-in-hand with the American mob and the government.
[02:17:18.541 --> 02:17:29.151]  You know, he may have had some romanticism attached to him at that point, but very quickly he realized that to maintain control and power, he went on a murderous rampage.
[02:17:29.151 --> 02:17:34.376]  And by President Obama recognizing Cuba, he's basically recognizing a mass murder regime.
[02:17:35.868 --> 02:17:44.513]  So, it's funny how a little island like this could have such a huge influence on American political history, and certainly it influenced my family.
[02:17:45.517 --> 02:18:07.988]  In 1959, my father is a CIA agent, went to Cuba undercover to assess the regime there, and he came back and chaired a meeting which was put together by Tracy Barnes of the CIA to establish a task force to assassinate Castro.
[02:18:09.049 --> 02:18:17.644]  At the meeting, of course, my father was there, David Atlee Phillips, and a number of other well-known CIA assets and agents.
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:28.583]  And my father was the first CIA official to put forth that an invasion of Cuba had to coincide with the assassination of Fidel Castro.
[02:18:28.583 --> 02:18:37.566]  So a group was put together, presided over by Richard Nixon, who got funds from George Bush Sr.
[02:18:37.566 --> 02:18:38.667]  to put together this group.
[02:18:38.667 --> 02:18:45.869]  They called it Operation 40 because in the beginning there were 40 members, later expanded to 70 and perhaps more than that.
[02:18:47.068 --> 02:18:53.820]  Some of the names of these assassins and operatives of Operation 40 read like the who's who of American
[02:18:55.261 --> 02:18:57.222]  You know, history.
[02:18:57.222 --> 02:19:04.607]  Ted Shackley, David Morales, Barry Seale, Porter Goss, you know, it goes on and on and on.
[02:19:04.607 --> 02:19:06.848]  Some of the Watergate burglars were members.
[02:19:06.848 --> 02:19:22.857]  But as Frank Sturgis put it so well, he stated that Operation 40 would, upon orders, assassinate either members of the military or the political parties of the foreign countries that you were going to infiltrate or invade, and if necessary, some of your own members,
[02:19:23.237 --> 02:19:25.880]  Who was suspected of being foreign agents.
[02:19:25.880 --> 02:19:33.389]  So this was an off-the-shelf CIA operation which had assassination as its primary focus.
[02:19:34.488 --> 02:19:43.574]  And, of course, we know now that the CIA made many, many attempts, with and without the mafia, to get rid of Fidel Castro.
[02:19:43.574 --> 02:19:52.779]  Operation 40, of course, didn't stop with the assassinations of Castro, but went on to be involved in many, many other assassination attempts.
[02:19:52.779 --> 02:19:55.861]  Some were successful and some weren't.
[02:19:57.287 --> 02:19:57.787]  All right, St.
[02:19:57.787 --> 02:20:01.348]  John Hunt, thanks for joining us here on InfoWars and some background on Fidel Castro.
[02:20:01.348 --> 02:20:05.209]  Will you protect your family and North Korea's newest weapon, EMP?
[02:20:05.209 --> 02:20:09.371]  We buy guns to protect ourselves, home, health, and car insurance for accidents.
[02:20:09.371 --> 02:20:15.092]  Maybe you also have food storage, but how would you keep your refrigerator running in a long-term EMP blackout?

[02:23:28.829 --> 02:23:31.571]  Taking turmeric is good, but there's a problem with it.
[02:23:31.571 --> 02:23:37.474]  The active ingredient in turmeric, known as curcumin, is poorly absorbed into the cells due to its large particle size.
[02:23:37.474 --> 02:23:42.157]  But now, One Planet Nutrition has the answer for this powerful anti-inflammatory.

[02:24:22.936 --> 02:24:28.381]  Welcome back, I'm Roger Stone, filling the very big shoes of Alex Jones today on InfoWars.
[02:24:28.381 --> 02:24:37.689]  I want to bring your attention to the extension of the Cyber Monday free speech special that's been offered here at the InfoWars.com store.
[02:24:37.689 --> 02:24:40.872]  Now you can achieve two great things here.
[02:24:40.872 --> 02:24:46.197]  First of all, they have their special male virility vitality formula, pardon me,
[02:24:47.137 --> 02:24:51.900]  Which is 30% off during this very special sale.
[02:24:51.900 --> 02:24:54.722]  Now the revolution isn't free.
[02:24:54.722 --> 02:25:00.746]  It costs money to keep this beacon of free speech, InfoWars, in business.
[02:25:00.746 --> 02:25:03.087]  So you can achieve two things.
[02:25:03.087 --> 02:25:08.711]  You can strike back at those who want to restrict the internet, those who want to gag
[02:25:09.591 --> 02:25:18.776]  Free speech by libertarian and liberty-oriented organs like Infowars.com, Breitbart, Daily Caller, and others.
[02:25:18.776 --> 02:25:21.877]  And you can help finance what we're doing here.
[02:25:21.877 --> 02:25:30.442]  At the same time, you can take a proven formula, which has literally hundreds of endorsements from satisfied users.
[02:25:31.242 --> 02:25:33.904]  So it's a win-win for both sides.
[02:25:33.904 --> 02:25:41.790]  I really strongly urge you to go to the Infowars.com store and grab the super male vitality formula.
[02:25:41.790 --> 02:25:44.492]  I don't think you'll be disappointed.
[02:25:44.492 --> 02:25:56.502]  So we are now going into a crucial phase of the Trump administration and there is of course the massive struggle over who will be Secretary of State.
[02:25:57.062 --> 02:26:00.525]  We're going to come back and talk about that in a little bit.
[02:26:00.525 --> 02:26:06.731]  But the President has made some new appointments that I think are pivotal.
[02:26:06.731 --> 02:26:15.920]  Steve Mnuchin at Treasury, although he has a background at Goldman Sachs, he is without any question a Trump loyalist.
[02:26:16.420 --> 02:26:35.697]  What this means to me is that the Trump economic plan that was laid out by Larry Kudlow and Steve Moore and other pro-growth advocates in their assistance to President-elect Donald Trump is highly likely to be implemented without bureaucratic interference.
[02:26:36.377 --> 02:26:43.086]  Mnuchin is really, in many ways, a close friend and extension of the President-elect.
[02:26:43.086 --> 02:26:50.696]  And therefore, I don't expect there to be any dilution of Trumpism when it comes to the economy.
[02:26:51.417 --> 02:26:58.422]  Now as David Knight said in the opening segment, that really is the keystone of the Trump reforms.
[02:26:58.422 --> 02:27:14.754]  Without a growing, in fact a surging economy, it will be very difficult for President Trump to fix the country's other problems, rebuild our national defense, renegotiate these enormous globalist trade deals that have ruined the job market in the United States.
[02:27:15.714 --> 02:27:23.441]  Or, as he has stated numerous times, to overhaul our immigration system.
[02:27:23.441 --> 02:27:25.943]  The wall is going to cost money.
[02:27:25.943 --> 02:27:29.245]  Money that our government doesn't have today.
[02:27:29.245 --> 02:27:36.091]  When Hillary Clinton went off to bomb Libya, we had to borrow a million dollars to pay for the bombs.
[02:27:36.091 --> 02:27:38.292]  That's how tight the Federal Treasury is.
[02:27:39.053 --> 02:27:48.087]  I also think Donald Trump is the only president in recent memory who may actually have some prospect for cutting federal spending.
[02:27:48.087 --> 02:27:53.114]  That's because he is not beholden to any particular special interest.
[02:27:54.008 --> 02:28:01.854]  He doesn't owe anyone, not the bankers, not Wall Street, not the lobbyists, not the special pleaders.
[02:28:01.854 --> 02:28:10.380]  He'll be the first president, in my memory, whose only criteria will be, is it good for the American people?
[02:28:10.380 --> 02:28:18.586]  Now, every Republican candidate for president that I have supported and worked for has talked about cutting federal spending.
[02:28:19.608 --> 02:28:22.389]  Sadly, it's been campaign rhetoric.
[02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:27.130]  No president has shrunk the size and scope of the federal government.
[02:28:27.130 --> 02:28:32.271]  I think Donald Trump may be the first one who can do so.
[02:28:32.271 --> 02:28:41.393]  I do want to say, with the inauguration coming up, I strongly urge you to go to the Infowars.com store and get your Trump is my president t-shirt.
[02:28:42.233 --> 02:28:48.036]  This is going to be the t-shirt to wear in Washington on January 20th.
[02:28:48.036 --> 02:28:50.617]  There's going to be a limited number of these.
[02:28:50.617 --> 02:28:56.040]  They're going to end up in the Smithsonian as part of the overall Trump revolution.
[02:28:56.040 --> 02:29:00.182]  So believe me, grab yours now while they're still available.
[02:29:00.182 --> 02:29:03.744]  I'm giving them away for Christmas presents to be honest with you.
[02:29:03.744 --> 02:29:07.186]  If you have a chance and you haven't done so yet, you could also grab
[02:29:07.686 --> 02:29:14.691]  The iconic Trump rape, pardon me, the iconic Clinton rape t-shirt.
[02:29:14.691 --> 02:29:24.217]  This is the t-shirt that Alex Jones and I use to break through the mainstream media blackout on Bill Clinton's real record as a sexual predator.
[02:29:24.217 --> 02:29:26.298]  Thanks for joining us here at Infowars.
[02:29:49.679 --> 02:29:53.610]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.610 --> 02:29:56.277]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.345 --> 02:30:08.849]  A gun scare at a swanky hotel in New York City last night resulted in police swarming the lobby and taking four people into custody.
[02:30:08.849 --> 02:30:11.871]  Now, I'm talking, of course, about the Gramercy Park Hotel.
[02:30:11.871 --> 02:30:20.315]  A report coming out of a CBS local affiliate in New York says the guests at the five-star hotel were greeted with storms of police last night over, quote, terror concerns.
[02:30:20.315 --> 02:30:26.038]  Four people were ultimately taken into custody over a Facebook Live video that they were conducting in the hotel room.
[02:30:26.138 --> 02:30:29.900]  Now, these guests in the lobby were obviously greeted with massive police.
[02:30:29.900 --> 02:30:36.303]  They were rightfully confused, and one of them said she was, quote, shocked by the incident, wanting to just leave the lobby as soon as possible.
[02:30:36.303 --> 02:30:41.305]  Police arriving around 4.15 with a report of a threat because of the Facebook Live post.
[02:30:41.305 --> 02:30:48.749]  Now, this is what one police spokesperson told Patch News around 7 p.m., quote, a bunch of people were arrested for having BB guns at the location.
[02:30:48.749 --> 02:30:55.332]  Yes, they were live streaming with BB guns and drug paraphernalia in the room, creating an all-out terror threat alert.
[02:30:55.672 --> 02:30:57.014]  This is what it's come to, folks.
[02:30:57.014 --> 02:31:00.199]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:31:00.199 --> 02:31:06.688]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[02:31:06.688 --> 02:31:11.716]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ.
[02:31:12.116 --> 02:31:19.659]  And how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[02:31:19.659 --> 02:31:23.320]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:31:23.320 --> 02:31:28.182]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you.
[02:31:28.322 --> 02:31:30.303]  How to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:31:30.303 --> 02:31:43.171]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:31:43.171 --> 02:31:44.712]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:31:45.012 --> 02:31:51.397]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[02:31:51.397 --> 02:31:56.341]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:32:00.049 --> 02:32:03.172]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[02:32:03.172 --> 02:32:07.257]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[02:32:07.257 --> 02:32:09.919]  Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[02:32:09.919 --> 02:32:12.762]  I'm Charlie Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[02:32:12.762 --> 02:32:15.866]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces.
[02:32:16.266 --> 02:32:22.013]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag.
[02:32:22.013 --> 02:32:23.094]  Heritage.
[02:32:23.094 --> 02:32:24.696]  Mom and apple pie.
[02:32:24.696 --> 02:32:26.117]  God was in school.
[02:32:26.117 --> 02:32:28.100]  Morality had a future.
[02:32:28.100 --> 02:32:30.963]  And beef was for supper.
[02:32:30.963 --> 02:32:32.184]  Revelation.
[02:32:32.184 --> 02:32:33.546]  Dawn of global government.
[02:32:33.906 --> 02:32:35.087]  We're the solution!
[02:32:35.087 --> 02:32:36.008]  Americans!
[02:32:36.008 --> 02:32:37.589]  Ain't nothing more to it than that!
[02:32:37.589 --> 02:32:42.794]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[02:32:42.794 --> 02:32:44.615]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[02:32:44.615 --> 02:32:46.577]  DVDs now available.
[02:32:46.577 --> 02:32:50.140]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[02:32:50.140 --> 02:32:52.962]  Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[02:32:52.962 --> 02:32:55.745]  Americans need to see this film.
[02:32:55.745 --> 02:32:58.407]  Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[02:32:58.407 --> 02:32:59.288]  Let's fix it.
[02:33:03.530 --> 02:33:07.137]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:07.137 --> 02:33:11.284]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:25.464 --> 02:33:28.606]  Welcome back to InfoWars, this is Roger Stone.
[02:33:28.606 --> 02:33:42.672]  I'm filling in today for Alex Jones while he takes a few very well-deserved days off, having been an MVP in the Trump revolution, having been Trump from the very beginning.
[02:33:42.672 --> 02:33:46.713]  So he is getting a well-deserved rest.
[02:33:46.713 --> 02:33:49.875]  Now I want to talk about the inauguration because I know many
[02:33:51.135 --> 02:34:02.623]  of the Trump activists around the country are very anxious to attend and I would urge you to send your name and address and your email address to DefendDonald.com.
[02:34:02.623 --> 02:34:07.245]  We are assembling the names of those who wish to go to the inauguration.
[02:34:07.245 --> 02:34:14.230]  Now to be clear, this will allow you to purchase tickets for some of the public inauguration events
[02:34:14.850 --> 02:34:18.772]  The actual inauguration, the swearing-in, is handled by the U.S.
[02:34:18.772 --> 02:34:22.773]  Congress, and tickets to that are controlled by the U.S.
[02:34:22.773 --> 02:34:23.694]  Congress.
[02:34:23.694 --> 02:34:32.177]  And after the Cabinet and the Congress and the foreign dignitaries and the other federal officials are seated, there's about 20% left for the American people.
[02:34:34.478 --> 02:34:39.840]  Write your congressman if you want to attend, but frankly, good luck.
[02:34:39.840 --> 02:34:47.924]  Now, our next guest, Jack Posobiec, was a very key activist in the Trump Citizens for Trump effort.
[02:34:47.924 --> 02:34:57.128]  He's a security expert and he joins us now to talk to us about the inauguration.
[02:34:57.128 --> 02:35:02.290]  Now, many of you may recall that Barack Obama walked the parade route
[02:35:02.810 --> 02:35:03.711]  And of course, D.C.
[02:35:03.711 --> 02:35:05.732]  was his kind of town.
[02:35:05.732 --> 02:35:14.679]  There is some question as to whether President-elect Donald Trump will walk or ride and the other necessary security procedures.
[02:35:14.679 --> 02:35:16.200]  So, Jack, why don't you take it away?
[02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:20.003]  Hi, good afternoon, Roger, and thanks so much for having me on today.
[02:35:21.511 --> 02:35:32.220]  A lot of talk has been going on between the Secret Service and the transition team regarding Mr. Trump's personal safety, or I should say President-elect Trump's personal safety for the inauguration.
[02:35:32.220 --> 02:35:35.763]  We know that this event has been targeted by George Soros.
[02:35:35.763 --> 02:35:45.892]  We know that they plan specifically to disrupt the organization of the inauguration and disrupt the inaugural festivities and are actually calling it as such.
[02:35:46.716 --> 02:35:51.305]  George W. Bush, if some will recall, did not actually take the walk.
[02:35:51.909 --> 02:36:08.633]  During the procession from the Congressional Building all the way down to the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, George W. Bush instead rode in the car, the presidential limousine, until just about the point where he got to the White House, stepped out, and then walked in the final bit of the way.
[02:36:08.633 --> 02:36:18.515]  So there's been some discussion as to whether the threat level to Mr. Trump is going to be similar to that and whether or not he should walk that or ride in the car.
[02:36:19.247 --> 02:36:23.612]  And personally, I'm in the position of he should ride in the car.
[02:36:23.612 --> 02:36:33.602]  With what we're seeing from George Soros, as well as Al Sharpton, calls for organizations, tens of thousands of protesters will be descending onto DC.
[02:36:33.602 --> 02:36:38.668]  They're holding planning meetings as we speak, looking at ways to infiltrate security.
[02:36:38.668 --> 02:36:40.810]  They're also suing to block
[02:36:42.212 --> 02:36:50.734]  Donald Trump from having bleachers in front of the Trump Hotel for the guests to simply watch the parade because that is the level to which they're taking their disruption.
[02:36:52.763 --> 02:36:54.705]  I do want to make one correction, Jack.
[02:36:54.705 --> 02:36:56.026]  I had the email address wrong.
[02:36:56.026 --> 02:36:58.888]  It is DefendTrump.com.
[02:36:58.888 --> 02:37:13.420]  So if you're interested in participating in the inauguration, if you plan to go to Washington, and we urge you to do so and to wear your Trump is my President t-shirt, go to DefendTrump.com.
[02:37:13.420 --> 02:37:14.201]  I apologize.
[02:37:14.201 --> 02:37:15.001]  I had that wrong.
[02:37:15.001 --> 02:37:17.684]  It's DefendTrump.com.
[02:37:17.684 --> 02:37:19.965]  Jack, this morning I saw an email.
[02:37:20.626 --> 02:37:21.086]  I don't
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:41.441]  This is absolutely correct, and this is the same type of
[02:38:00.225 --> 02:38:05.988]  Really fascist-type tactics that George Soros has used in parts of Eastern Europe to push his agenda.
[02:38:05.988 --> 02:38:10.271]  It is an anti-democratic agenda, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
[02:38:10.271 --> 02:38:18.175]  They are trying to interfere with America's process of democracy, and they are looking at ways to interject themselves in any way, shape, or form.
[02:38:18.175 --> 02:38:26.060]  They are using, essentially, George Soros' brown shirts to go and disrupt the democratic proceeding, the inauguration,
[02:38:26.553 --> 02:38:36.119]  And now, if people want to go and demonstrate, that is perfectly fine, and that is their First Amendment protected rights, as we were all reminded yesterday about the vigorous discussion about the First Amendment.
[02:38:36.119 --> 02:38:43.243]  However, disrupting what is essentially an official process of our democratic system is certainly not protected by the U.S.
[02:38:43.243 --> 02:38:44.364]  Constitution.
[02:38:44.364 --> 02:38:49.727]  They are calling for this violence in an attempt not only to delegitimize Donald Trump,
[02:38:50.049 --> 02:38:53.813]  But to delegitimize the entire democratic system of the United States.
[02:38:53.813 --> 02:39:01.680]  This is what George Soros wants and this is what he's wanted from the start and he's put millions of dollars behind this and millions of dollars are going to go into these groups as well.
[02:39:03.356 --> 02:39:10.344]  Now, there's been some discussion of holding a counter-demonstration in support of President-elect Trump.
[02:39:10.344 --> 02:39:12.806]  This is an idea I really like.
[02:39:12.806 --> 02:39:25.019]  And I know you and I and others have had scouts out looking for a legal location where we could actually do such a pro-Trump demonstration, if you will.
[02:39:26.020 --> 02:39:26.861]  And of course the U.S.
[02:39:26.861 --> 02:39:38.627]  Park Service is not, which controls most of the real estate in and around the District of Columbia, at least the public spaces, doesn't seem to be very keen on having us there.
[02:39:38.627 --> 02:39:50.313]  Now we are forced to look at locations perhaps across the river in Virginia but close to the riverbank so that we can also be seen and heard and we can demonstrate
[02:39:50.973 --> 02:40:07.064]  That we are the silent majority, that we are the forgotten Americans, that the average Americans support President Trump and they're calling foul on these paid-for Soros-sponsored demonstrations.
[02:40:07.064 --> 02:40:13.168]  How does the outlook appear to you in terms of finding a viable location?
[02:40:13.168 --> 02:40:15.950]  For finding a viable location, it is tricky.
[02:40:15.950 --> 02:40:20.793]  As you said, the National Park Service is shutting down, essentially, permits, legal permits,
[02:40:21.260 --> 02:40:26.422]  That usually are submitted within one year of the inauguration.
[02:40:26.422 --> 02:40:38.365]  We were told that it would be perfectly fine to get one of these permits and that 84%, again we were told, of the parade route as well as the inaugural festivities would be available to us.
[02:40:38.365 --> 02:40:47.528]  However, just like we saw in Cleveland at the RNC, what we are told and how things work in practice are two very different things.
[02:40:47.975 --> 02:40:58.142]  So I think that just like that event that we held in Cleveland with Citizens for Trump, we can go out to the banks of the Potomac River in Virginia.
[02:40:58.142 --> 02:40:59.623]  There are numerous parks there.
[02:40:59.623 --> 02:41:03.986]  There are numerous places that are actually outside of the National Park Service.
[02:41:03.986 --> 02:41:14.474]  We would then be dealing with the government of the state of Virginia, which is a completely different entity from the National Park Service, and simply applying for a permit to hold a demonstration in support of Donald Trump.
[02:41:14.815 --> 02:41:32.859]  As well as in support of the United States democratic process and really show the American people and show the cameras that we will stand up to George Soros and we will not let him disrupt these inaugural festivities as they've set foot.
[02:41:32.859 --> 02:41:44.322]  Their jackboot troops are not the same as what we're looking for in terms of the ordinary, regular Americans who want to see the process of democracy and the transition of power conducted in a smooth and fair manner.
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:52.347]  All right, Jack Posobiak, I hear, by the way, that you may be under consideration for a job at the White House.
[02:41:52.347 --> 02:42:01.416]  I'm happy to add my recommendation to that application because I know what an effective job you did working for Citizens for Trump.
[02:42:01.416 --> 02:42:05.220]  So, thanks for joining us here at InfoWars.
[02:42:05.220 --> 02:42:05.801]  Thank you much, Roger.
[02:42:07.746 --> 02:42:21.157]  This would be a good time for me to remind you that the Infowar Select Storable Foods are now at a 30 to 40 percent discount based on the Black Friday preparedness sale that's been announced.
[02:42:21.157 --> 02:42:26.602]  Now, these Select Storable Foods have a shelf life of 25 years.
[02:42:28.263 --> 02:42:37.710]  I myself have a storage of these products because one never knows about national disasters or political disasters.
[02:42:37.710 --> 02:42:46.115]  I don't expect political instability under President Trump, but I do think it is wise to be prepared.
[02:42:46.115 --> 02:42:51.119]  These food prices are going up around the world and now is the time to get started to
[02:42:51.499 --> 02:43:07.065]  Storing these these shelf life foods that last you 25 years in case of dire emergency You owe it to your family to go to the Infowars.com store now and get your select storable foods Now we're joined by
[02:43:08.095 --> 02:43:08.836]  Thanks, Roger.
[02:43:08.836 --> 02:43:09.336]  How you doing?
[02:43:28.971 --> 02:43:30.552]  Doing great, thank you.
[02:43:30.552 --> 02:43:35.315]  So the first and most important thing I want to ask you, Chris, is Florida.
[02:43:35.315 --> 02:43:42.621]  Florida was, you know, really one of the absolute key states in Donald Trump's election.
[02:43:42.621 --> 02:43:49.705]  And we all saw the polls leading to Election Day that showed him, by and large, narrowly trailing there.
[02:43:50.806 --> 02:44:05.446]  And he did not seem to achieve the vote levels in the Southern counties of Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach that would appear to be necessary for a statewide Republican to win.
[02:44:05.446 --> 02:44:06.627]  Yet, he won.
[02:44:07.228 --> 02:44:19.984]  Now, I think he won for one reason, because of the superb campaign leadership of Susie Wiles, who ran the campaign for Donald Trump, and one of the most capable women that I know.
[02:44:19.984 --> 02:44:23.989]  But, I know you have your finger on some of the big picture trends.
[02:44:23.989 --> 02:44:25.872]  What really happened in the Sunshine State?
[02:44:27.133 --> 02:44:29.316]  Well, and that really is the big question.
[02:44:29.316 --> 02:44:36.487]  Like you, everyone read that if Trump loses Florida, the race will be over by 7.30 and that'll be the end of everything.
[02:44:36.487 --> 02:44:41.734]  And then the initial reports started coming in that there were these huge deficits in Broward County.
[02:44:42.575 --> 02:44:43.255]  We're good to go.
[02:45:01.278 --> 02:45:05.200]  And you know, pretty early on we had a pretty good feeling that this was going to happen.
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:10.982]  That we were going to be able to carry the state of Florida for Trump and to deliver the electoral votes.
[02:45:10.982 --> 02:45:15.824]  And it is basically impossible for a Republican to be elected President of the United States without having
[02:45:16.747 --> 02:45:17.628]  The state of Florida.
[02:45:17.628 --> 02:45:19.229]  And, you know, you mentioned Suzy Wiles.
[02:45:19.229 --> 02:45:23.092]  You know, Suzy is beyond a rock star at this stuff.
[02:45:23.092 --> 02:45:32.218]  I mean, she ran the campaign for Rick Scott, who was little known before he beat Bill McCollum and then defeated Alex Fink to become governor.
[02:45:32.218 --> 02:45:38.062]  And then to take this, the Trump race, to be told by everybody that you just have no chance with this and deliver that state.
[02:45:38.062 --> 02:45:40.924]  It's just really a testimony to her and the campaign team they put together.
[02:45:42.090 --> 02:45:43.431]  Yeah, no, it really is.
[02:45:43.431 --> 02:45:49.493]  It's almost a political miracle, particularly given the spending levels for the Clinton campaign.
[02:45:49.493 --> 02:46:03.800]  I think nationally, my very best estimation between the Clinton campaign, the Clinton super PACs, and the various legal and illegal operations of George Soros, I think they come pretty close to $2 billion.
[02:46:05.781 --> 02:46:17.693]  At the same time, I saw the Trump campaign spending, including the super PACs, independent super PACs and other friendlies, probably close to 280 million dollars.
[02:46:17.693 --> 02:46:19.715]  A giant disparity.
[02:46:19.715 --> 02:46:28.923]  Now, in a super state like Florida, where television advertising is pivotal, could you feel that difference on watching television, listening to the radio?
[02:46:28.923 --> 02:46:30.345]  Was it palpable?
[02:46:31.340 --> 02:46:32.200]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:44.986]  I mean, first and foremost, if you have the audacity to watch a news program in the last week or two before the campaign, any sort of primetime news, it was just absolute inundation from the Hillary Clinton campaign.
[02:46:44.986 --> 02:46:49.067]  You know, Trump had his presence, but it was just, it was a small fraction.
[02:46:49.067 --> 02:46:50.408]  And the numbers that you said, I think, would be about
[02:46:50.908 --> 02:46:51.429]  We're good to go.
[02:47:11.997 --> 02:47:12.658]  We're good to go.
[02:47:35.021 --> 02:47:38.262]  That put Nancy Pelosi back into the leader position.
[02:47:38.262 --> 02:47:44.244]  I think the definition of insanity is often lamented as being doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome.
[02:47:44.244 --> 02:47:52.086]  And I got to tell you something, you know, by secret ballot, they decided to maintain course, which really does kind of make you wonder if they learned anything from the whole experience.
[02:47:53.424 --> 02:47:58.688]  Well, Chris, I know that happy hour is one of your specialties, and I look forward to joining you for that.
[02:47:58.688 --> 02:48:03.012]  I know when you were in the legislature, you were a real champion of regulatory reform.
[02:48:03.012 --> 02:48:04.913]  This was a passion of yours.
[02:48:04.913 --> 02:48:15.322]  Now, Obama has all these executive orders that have bulked up the bureaucracy and helped bolster the liberal agenda.
[02:48:15.322 --> 02:48:20.206]  What do you think the outlook is in terms of rolling back some of the things Obama has done?
[02:48:21.826 --> 02:48:23.467]  Well, it is the story to tell.
[02:48:23.467 --> 02:48:42.175]  I mean, the reality is that if you date back to school when you used to watch, you know, a bill on Capitol Hill and you'd hear about how a bill becomes a law, there was this deliberative process that involved the House and the Senate with a signature from the executive branch, whether it be the governor of the states or the president and the federal government.
[02:48:42.175 --> 02:48:49.458]  But the reality over the last, I think it was about 70 years, but really has ramped up lately is that most of the damage that is done
[02:48:50.450 --> 02:48:50.971]  I don't know.
[02:49:02.595 --> 02:49:05.438]  There is presumption that they have the authority to do it.
[02:49:05.438 --> 02:49:11.824]  So if you don't like what happens, you have to go out and challenge it in court and determine whether or not the president has that.
[02:49:11.824 --> 02:49:21.052]  And then all the agencies, the EPA and all these different groups across the country promulgate rules, which I got news for you, a rule.
[02:49:21.052 --> 02:49:24.315]  If you have a business, they can shut your business down if you violate the rule.
[02:49:24.315 --> 02:49:26.197]  They can put you in jail if you violate the rule.
[02:49:26.197 --> 02:49:28.559]  So when people say rules, it's really just a law.
[02:49:29.079 --> 02:49:41.157]  But the collection of bureaucratic proliferation of rules, in combination with executive orders, creates what is not a shadow government, it's a primary government, because in a country where you don't have
[02:49:42.020 --> 02:49:45.823]  I don't think there's a annual budget passed by Congress designed by the President anymore.
[02:49:45.823 --> 02:49:47.325]  This is really what you're talking about.
[02:49:47.325 --> 02:50:01.136]  So, one of the very fascinating elements of Barack Obama's presidency was his willingness, because he, you know, for the last six years did not have a sympathetic legislature, really took to the use of the executive order pen.
[02:50:01.136 --> 02:50:08.122]  And I would say, you know, most of what you hear is that it all, if not all, certainly most, an overwhelming majority,
[02:50:08.860 --> 02:50:14.042]  These rules will be or executive orders will be wiped out in the earliest hours of a Trump presidency.
[02:50:14.042 --> 02:50:20.805]  And then the question is going to be whether or not the, you know, the president-elect and the Congress has the will to cede power.
[02:50:20.805 --> 02:50:28.128]  And part of what makes the United States so special is that our executive is restrained and oftentimes has to restrain themselves.
[02:50:28.128 --> 02:50:33.671]  And, you know, it appears that we have a Republican majority House and a Republican majority Senate.
[02:50:34.311 --> 02:50:34.752]  All right.
[02:50:34.752 --> 02:50:34.972]  All right.
[02:50:34.972 --> 02:50:35.652]  Thank you, Chris Dorworth.

[02:52:50.421 --> 02:52:52.683]  Not just me, a lot of musicians.
[02:52:52.683 --> 02:52:53.984]  You're gonna like this.
[02:52:53.984 --> 02:52:57.266]  This message is brought to you by FetalRecords.com.

[02:54:18.561 --> 02:54:23.726]  This is Roger Stone, back at Info Wars, filling in for the great Alex Jones.
[02:54:23.726 --> 02:54:25.488]  Privileged to be here.
[02:54:25.488 --> 02:54:27.370]  We're talking politics.
[02:54:27.370 --> 02:54:29.852]  We're focused on the recount some.
[02:54:29.852 --> 02:54:37.599]  But now I'd like to turn to the question of whether Bill and Hillary Clinton and their greedy little daughter, Chelsea, will be prosecuted.
[02:54:38.280 --> 02:54:44.203]  You see, at the height of Watergate, we were told that no person is above the law.
[02:54:44.203 --> 02:54:57.790]  Now, I appreciate the sentiments of President-elect Trump, who said last week in a New York Times interview that it would not be his inclination to prosecute the Clintons.
[02:54:57.790 --> 02:55:01.672]  But I would also argue that we don't even have a full catalogue of their crimes.
[02:55:02.752 --> 02:55:18.358]  And that the treasure trove of emails that were kept by Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner contain solid advice of treason, corruption, sexual exploitation, and worse.
[02:55:20.001 --> 02:55:34.080]  When FBI Director Comey said on the Monday before the election that the FBI had reviewed those emails, 650,000 of them, and determined that they were insignificant, he was lying.
[02:55:35.080 --> 02:55:46.593]  Members of the New York Police Department who first located and reviewed the emails and forwarded a copy to the FBI, tell me otherwise.
[02:55:46.593 --> 02:55:52.439]  And therefore, I think the President-elect's comments may simply be premature.
[02:55:52.439 --> 02:55:56.364]  In fact, by early next year, they may be outdated.
[02:55:57.521 --> 02:56:26.294]  I am one who believes that in both the email scandal, particularly given the prosecution of General David Petraeus, and in the Clinton Foundation scandals, which believe me, is a cornucopia of illegal activities to line the pockets of the Clintons and finance their machine, that there are many, many prosecutable crimes.
[02:56:27.074 --> 02:56:28.335]  So you can do two things.
[02:56:28.335 --> 02:56:43.228]  You can go to StoneColdTruth.com, where there is a petition that you can sign to President-elect Trump and to Attorney General-designate Jeff Sessions, insisting on the prosecution of the Clintons.
[02:56:43.228 --> 02:56:49.092]  Or you could go to ChargeHillaryClinton.com and sign a similar petition.
[02:56:49.893 --> 02:56:52.256]  In numbers, there is strength.
[02:56:52.256 --> 02:56:59.664]  It is vitally important that we demonstrate that we are a nation of laws, not a nation of men.
[02:56:59.664 --> 02:57:05.530]  And indeed, no man and no woman is above the law.
[02:57:05.530 --> 02:57:08.413]  So, please, go to those sites today.
[02:57:08.413 --> 02:57:11.477]  Sign up for the activism that will be necessary.
[02:57:12.017 --> 02:57:18.262]  We may have to remind those in Washington why it's so important that we prosecute.
[02:57:18.262 --> 02:57:38.118]  But at the end of the day, I believe the news stories in the beginning of 2017 that detail crimes by the Clintons, crimes we haven't even heard about yet, crimes that the American people are unaware of, I think that justice can and will be done.
[02:57:38.118 --> 02:57:41.201]  Let me borrow a phrase from Al Sharpton.
[02:57:41.801 --> 02:57:44.322]  No justice, no peace.
[02:57:44.322 --> 02:57:51.423]  So go to chargehillaryclinton.com and sign the petition today.
[02:57:51.423 --> 02:58:02.586]  This will be one of the major talking points for the pro-Trump rally and demonstration that we plan for the banks of the Potomac on January 20th.
[02:58:05.892 --> 02:58:09.356]  One other piece of advice I'm gonna give you very quickly.
[02:58:09.356 --> 02:58:14.200]  Go to the InfoWars.com store and grab some of the Brain Force.
[02:58:14.200 --> 02:58:16.723]  It's the thing propelling me through the show today.
[02:58:16.723 --> 02:58:22.168]  It's a dynamite product that helps your mental clarity, your focus, and your energy.
[02:58:22.168 --> 02:58:24.570]  I can't say enough about Brain Force.
[02:58:24.570 --> 02:58:27.533]  I popped two of them about an hour and a half ago.
[02:58:27.533 --> 02:58:29.595]  And thanks for being here at InfoWars.
[02:58:42.914 --> 02:58:46.889]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:50.231 --> 02:58:54.375]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:54.375 --> 02:59:01.863]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable grape-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[02:59:01.863 --> 02:59:12.895]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[02:59:13.295 --> 02:59:21.139]  In the history of InfoWars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[02:59:21.139 --> 02:59:30.763]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[02:59:30.763 --> 02:59:35.205]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:59:35.205 --> 02:59:41.928]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:59:42.288 --> 02:59:43.749]  That means it's clean.
[02:59:43.749 --> 02:59:44.889]  That means it's pure.
[02:59:44.889 --> 02:59:47.671]  That's InfoWarsWife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:59:47.671 --> 02:59:52.693]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:59:52.693 --> 02:59:55.334]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.696 --> 03:00:14.377]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:14.377 --> 03:00:22.780]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[03:00:22.780 --> 03:00:32.763]  This is Roger Stone sitting in for Alex Jones here at InfoWars and continuing today.
[03:00:32.763 --> 03:00:38.305]  We're going to focus now on the controversy in Washington regarding the choice of our Secretary of State.
[03:00:39.405 --> 03:00:57.775]  Joe Scarborough from Morning Joe claimed that Donald Trump was upset with his political advisor Kellyanne Conway, a longtime friend of mine, because she correctly said on Twitter that there was much objection among the Trump foot soldiers to the appointment of Romney.
[03:00:57.775 --> 03:01:02.338]  Now Mitt Romney didn't just oppose Donald Trump, he called him a fraud.
[03:01:03.103 --> 03:01:05.205]  He called Trump a phony.
[03:01:05.205 --> 03:01:07.827]  He called him a con man.
[03:01:07.827 --> 03:01:10.730]  That's not reasonable political discourse.
[03:01:10.730 --> 03:01:15.694]  Even worse, Mitt Romney's borrowed his political philosophy from the Bush's.
[03:01:15.694 --> 03:01:28.565]  He's a neocon, bellicose and warming up for war against Russia, a full-throated supporter of the Iraq war and the other adventures around the globe that Americans are still paying for.
[03:01:29.125 --> 03:01:42.948]  Now, when Maggie Haberman of the New York Times wrote that Trump was not upset with Kelly, Scarborough attacked Haberman viciously on Morning Joe.
[03:01:42.948 --> 03:01:45.188]  Here's the problem.
[03:01:45.188 --> 03:01:46.569]  Haberman is right.
[03:01:46.569 --> 03:01:48.409]  Scarborough is wrong.
[03:01:48.409 --> 03:01:58.331]  Donald Trump is not the source of Scarborough's report that Donald Trump is upset with Kelly for pointing out the opposition to Mitt Romney.
[03:01:59.309 --> 03:02:01.411]  I know who the source is.
[03:02:01.411 --> 03:02:03.813]  It is not Donald Trump.
[03:02:03.813 --> 03:02:08.477]  So, in this case, a gold star for Kellyanne Conway.
[03:02:08.477 --> 03:02:17.284]  I think that she has wisely pointed out the pitfalls in this comity that is taking place.
[03:02:17.284 --> 03:02:26.532]  Now, Reince Priebus, the President-elect's chief of staff designate, specifically denies that he has been pushing Romney.
[03:02:27.540 --> 03:02:33.863]  Well, he will fit right into the Washington Beltway crowd because he's not telling the truth.
[03:02:33.863 --> 03:02:43.507]  And in fact, there are those around the President-elect who seem to think the nomination of Romney would be a good idea.
[03:02:43.507 --> 03:02:47.528]  Now, if not Romney, who?
[03:02:47.528 --> 03:02:48.689]  That's an excellent question.
[03:02:50.085 --> 03:02:59.633]  Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, has let it be known that this is a job that he would like, but it's not clear that he is the only candidate in the running.
[03:03:00.441 --> 03:03:09.709]  We also had David Petraeus who joined Donald Trump yesterday for a meeting and perhaps Petraeus is under consideration.
[03:03:09.709 --> 03:03:20.699]  Now some reporters have asked me, how could you appoint Petraeus in view of the fact that he pled to a charge of misusing government documents?
[03:03:21.601 --> 03:03:25.244]  Well, Petraeus is a good man who made a bad mistake.
[03:03:25.244 --> 03:03:39.797]  But he didn't show classified documents to the Chinese, or the Russians, or the Saudis, or the North Koreans, as Hillary Clinton most probably did, by putting classified documents up on an unsecure server.
[03:03:39.797 --> 03:03:45.783]  No, David Petraeus made the mistake of showing them to his girlfriend, who was writing a book.
[03:03:46.693 --> 03:03:50.155]  So he has paid a price for that mistake.
[03:03:50.155 --> 03:03:55.739]  Now it's time for Hillary Clinton to pay the price for her mistake.
[03:03:55.739 --> 03:04:13.172]  So I actually think the appointment of Petraeus to say the Defense Intelligence Agency, for example, would be able to be used to highlight the disparity between what happened to Petraeus and what happened to Hillary Clinton.
[03:04:13.996 --> 03:04:30.367]  I also point out the name of General Mike Kelly, who is a former commander of the Marine Corps, one of another Dark Horses in the Secretary of State mix.
[03:04:30.367 --> 03:04:37.412]  And then of course there's Senator Corker from Tennessee, although I think he's a non-starter.
[03:04:37.412 --> 03:04:43.736]  Stay tuned for more about the Secretary of State sweepstakes here on InfoWars.
[03:05:00.080 --> 03:05:07.745]  There's currently a war going on in this country, and it's waged against Breitbart, InfoWars, and Drudge, in large part because of Trump's victory.
[03:05:07.745 --> 03:05:13.128]  Now, the latest example of this, Apple is purging Breitbart News app from its iTunes store.
[03:05:13.128 --> 03:05:15.970]  We have an article that's up on our website written by Dan Layman.
[03:05:15.970 --> 03:05:20.113]  This latest move, Apple has removed Breitbart News app from their iTunes marketplace.
[03:05:20.353 --> 03:05:23.536]  It's an utter censorship of free speech and truth journalism.
[03:05:23.536 --> 03:05:28.179]  They're kicking it into overdrive, despite the app being available for the past three years.
[03:05:28.179 --> 03:05:37.467]  Now, Breitbart currently ranks 28th on SimilarWeb's top 100 media sites, and they had over 168 million page views in October alone.
[03:05:37.467 --> 03:05:45.173]  But their primary target for a massive concerted effort by these globalists is to suppress and silence all opposition deemed, quote, fake news.
[03:05:45.413 --> 03:05:46.255]  Including us!
[03:05:46.255 --> 03:05:53.847]  Now, the war on Breitbart has increased because of CEO Steve Bannon, who was ultimately appointed as the White House Chief Strategist in this latest move.
[03:05:53.847 --> 03:05:56.111]  They're trying to silence all real news.
[03:05:56.111 --> 03:05:58.635]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:06:00.031 --> 03:06:02.692]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[03:06:02.692 --> 03:06:04.852]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[03:06:04.852 --> 03:06:13.655]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house, like small refrigerators, to keep your food from spoiling.
[03:06:13.655 --> 03:06:16.175]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[03:06:16.175 --> 03:06:16.896]  It's mobile.
[03:06:16.896 --> 03:06:22.057]  The jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[03:06:22.057 --> 03:06:28.739]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[03:06:29.199 --> 03:06:30.219]  A true innovation.
[03:06:30.219 --> 03:06:32.300]  I have never seen anything like this.
[03:06:32.300 --> 03:06:34.020]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[03:06:34.020 --> 03:06:36.541]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[03:06:36.541 --> 03:06:40.721]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[03:06:40.721 --> 03:06:42.822]  Go to PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[03:06:42.822 --> 03:06:44.862]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.

[03:08:14.246 --> 03:08:20.432]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:20.432 --> 03:08:23.134]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:08:23.134 --> 03:08:26.597]  I'm Roger Stone filling in for Alex Jones.
[03:08:26.597 --> 03:08:30.020]  Great bite there of the birds to open the segment.
[03:08:30.880 --> 03:08:39.027]  Before we go any further, I want to remind you about the Super Male Vitality Formula available at InfoWars.com.

[03:08:57.463 --> 03:08:59.024]  The revolution isn't free.
[03:08:59.024 --> 03:09:07.571]  It costs money to bring you the vital messages that have helped elect Donald Trump and foment a revolution in this country.

[03:09:29.290 --> 03:09:38.240]  Now we are joined by Indy Wallace and Linda Hable from the Vote Protectors organization.
[03:09:38.240 --> 03:09:43.365]  These folks are patriots that I worked with very closely in our Stop the Steal effort.
[03:09:43.365 --> 03:09:45.968]  They have been on the cutting edge
[03:09:46.648 --> 03:09:53.894]  of the liberty-oriented effort to ensure that we had a free and fair election.
[03:09:53.894 --> 03:09:59.319]  So, Andy, Lindsey, thank you for joining us here at InfoWars.
[03:09:59.319 --> 03:10:02.802]  Well, thanks for having us on there, Roger.
[03:10:02.802 --> 03:10:07.366]  You folks did a fantastic job in this most recent election.
[03:10:07.366 --> 03:10:09.448]  And therefore, I've got to ask, what got you started?
[03:10:09.448 --> 03:10:12.851]  What motivated you to start Vote Protectors?
[03:10:14.312 --> 03:10:26.879]  Well, it's interesting, and let me just take a second to thank you for being the front man for the group, and also to thank everybody who got involved, all of our volunteers, all the boots on the ground.
[03:10:26.879 --> 03:10:42.648]  I'll tell you, frankly, I am a daily listener to InfoWars, and we were talking about, or Alex was talking about election fraud, and it struck me, this idea about exit polling, and I picked up the phone, and my idea was that
[03:10:43.553 --> 03:10:51.597]  Every American had the capacity to do an exit poll for themselves after they got done voting themselves.
[03:10:51.597 --> 03:11:04.763]  So, I called in, gave this idea, came up with the name Vote Protectors while I was on the phone with Alex, and started a Facebook page, and it was off and running just like that, and the response was phenomenal.
[03:11:05.544 --> 03:11:07.484]  Unbelievable response.
[03:11:07.484 --> 03:11:21.227]  And within probably two weeks, I connected with Andy Dion, who is a tech guy in Canada, and he put the website together and we were off to the races.
[03:11:21.227 --> 03:11:31.329]  Well, as you know, we were so successful in our launch that six Democratic state committees went to federal court
[03:11:32.213 --> 03:11:42.522]  To try to prevent us from taking a simple exit poll, claiming falsely, that we plan to intimidate minority voters.
[03:11:42.522 --> 03:11:55.132]  In every one of those suits, we prevailed, except for Ohio, where frankly they jackpotted us by never serving us, so we didn't know we were being sued.
[03:11:55.132 --> 03:12:00.596]  Consequently, a lawyer representing us could not show up in court and present our side.
[03:12:01.357 --> 03:12:05.240]  The judge, a Democrat, ruled against us.
[03:12:05.240 --> 03:12:18.270]  We appealed to the Sixth Circuit, where he was overturned, and then David Boies, the genius who ran the Al Gore 2000 recount, appealed to the U.S.
[03:12:18.270 --> 03:12:21.132]  Supreme Court to hear the case.
[03:12:21.132 --> 03:12:23.114]  They declined.
[03:12:23.114 --> 03:12:26.196]  Therefore, the score so far is Stone 2,
[03:12:28.117 --> 03:12:29.358]  Voice zero.
[03:12:29.358 --> 03:12:35.802]  Uh, I was gratified by that result, but Andy, they called us thugs.
[03:12:35.802 --> 03:12:37.103]  They called us hoodlums.
[03:12:37.103 --> 03:12:40.926]  Yeah.
[03:12:40.926 --> 03:12:44.428]  Let me tell you that this was a real eye opener for me.
[03:12:44.428 --> 03:12:52.354]  Um, first of all, you know, I want to encourage people that, you know, you hear on the show all the time that just a normal person can get involved and make a difference.
[03:12:52.354 --> 03:12:54.395]  And I'm a truck driver by trade.
[03:12:54.395 --> 03:12:54.415]  I,
[03:12:57.026 --> 03:13:00.030]  I didn't know that I could actually make a difference and I did.
[03:13:00.030 --> 03:13:02.374]  So I want to encourage everybody that they can too.
[03:13:02.374 --> 03:13:03.736]  Now when this website went up...
[03:13:04.745 --> 03:13:23.250]  It was absolutely the most benign idea that there was until the Huffington Post somehow twisted something and made up a story out of complete thin air to make out that we were going to be doing voter intimidation and that we were thugs, which is laughable to me.
[03:13:23.250 --> 03:13:33.733]  It was the most ridiculous thing and it just grew and grew through MSNBC and every day in the newspaper, this thuggery story which was completely fabricated.
[03:13:35.202 --> 03:13:49.678]  Yeah, no, they came up with this idea that we were somehow going to be issuing badges and therefore trying to pass ourselves off as election board officials, that we would be having armbands.
[03:13:49.678 --> 03:13:52.741]  It was only a matter of time before they accused us of carrying weapons.
[03:13:53.762 --> 03:13:55.003]  This was an absurdity.
[03:13:55.003 --> 03:13:58.584]  First of all, we weren't even addressing voters prior to their vote.
[03:13:58.584 --> 03:14:00.885]  This was not a poll-watching operation.
[03:14:00.885 --> 03:14:04.206]  This was an effort to make sure that the voters tracked.
[03:14:04.206 --> 03:14:06.087]  So, this is a good question for Lindsey.
[03:14:06.087 --> 03:14:08.448]  What kind of data did we collect on Election Day?
[03:14:08.448 --> 03:14:14.110]  And what do you feel the problems were at the polls that day?
[03:14:14.110 --> 03:14:21.373]  Well, I feel that the biggest problems were the election fraud as far as
[03:14:21.932 --> 03:14:23.813]  Let me go back a little bit.
[03:14:23.813 --> 03:14:29.576]  Prior to the election day, we were receiving all sorts of reports with irregularities.
[03:14:29.576 --> 03:14:44.682]  Texas is one of the states where people would vote for the Republican candidate, and when they were ready to submit their vote, they realized that it was switched to the Democrat candidate.
[03:14:44.682 --> 03:14:49.845]  And many times it was if they were voting straight Republican,
[03:14:51.058 --> 03:14:52.859]  We're also straight Democrat.
[03:14:52.859 --> 03:14:55.259]  It was happening in all of those cases.
[03:14:55.259 --> 03:14:59.360]  And then we moved on to election day.
[03:14:59.360 --> 03:15:02.721]  So election day for me started about after midnight.
[03:15:02.721 --> 03:15:06.502]  So we started receiving all different kinds of emails.
[03:15:06.502 --> 03:15:16.285]  And some of them, when the polls opened on the East Coast, were, again, the switching of the candidate for which the people had voted.
[03:15:16.285 --> 03:15:19.946]  The other is that in many states,
[03:15:21.078 --> 03:15:23.799]  Your ballot, there was a paper ballot given.
[03:15:23.799 --> 03:15:28.200]  However, there was no way to track your ballot to your voter registration.
[03:15:28.200 --> 03:15:39.062]  So you would fill out the ballot, circle in the candidate for whom you're voting, and you would feed it into a machine and it was gone.
[03:15:39.062 --> 03:15:44.484]  You don't know, you had no, there was no recourse.
[03:15:44.484 --> 03:15:45.524]  There was no way to tell
[03:15:47.316 --> 03:15:49.178]  What happened to your vote?
[03:15:49.178 --> 03:15:51.880]  No paper trail, as they say.
[03:15:51.880 --> 03:15:52.900]  None whatsoever.
[03:15:52.900 --> 03:15:55.382]  It was just all undocumented.
[03:15:55.382 --> 03:16:14.337]  We also received reports that the ballots were different from the sample ballots that were mailed over a month prior to the election, and the way the candidates were listed were very different, and they were far more confusing when a voter got to the booth.
[03:16:15.766 --> 03:16:21.052]  In New York, we found out, in upstate New York, that Hillary Clinton was listed twice.
[03:16:21.052 --> 03:16:29.501]  She was listed as the Democrat candidate, and she was also listed running for a party called the Working Family Party.
[03:16:31.590 --> 03:16:39.394]  Well, of course, in New York State, New York State is one of the few states in the nation that actually permits that.
[03:16:39.394 --> 03:16:43.996]  So, Donald Trump, for example, was the candidate of the Republican Party.
[03:16:43.996 --> 03:16:46.838]  He was also the candidate of the state Conservative Party.
[03:16:48.658 --> 03:17:02.843]  You have a multi-party system in New York, where you have the Democrats, the Republicans, the Working Families Party, which is really just a front for the public employee unions.
[03:17:02.843 --> 03:17:11.706]  You have the long-standing New York Conservative Party, and in this election, for the first time, you had the Reform Party.
[03:17:12.366 --> 03:17:20.109]  Uh, which, uh, was constituted by getting 50,000 votes in the last statewide gubernatorial election.
[03:17:20.109 --> 03:17:28.633]  So, um, the state does allow you to have the cumulative total of multiple party
[03:17:29.033 --> 03:17:30.594]  I don't see any evidence.
[03:17:46.139 --> 03:17:51.244]  That the Democrats have made any case or provided any evidence of actual fraud.
[03:17:51.244 --> 03:17:57.090]  Their complaints seem to be these computerized voting machines are hackable.
[03:17:57.090 --> 03:17:58.311]  Duh!
[03:17:58.311 --> 03:18:00.814]  And the polls were wrong.
[03:18:00.814 --> 03:18:08.842]  So if the poll showed Hillary winning and Trump won, the election must be wrong rather than maybe the poll was wrong.
[03:18:10.473 --> 03:18:19.320]  Well, Roger, first of all, let me say that on Election Day, from the beginning to the end, our exit poll results nationwide.
[03:18:19.320 --> 03:18:21.262]  And this was consistent.
[03:18:21.262 --> 03:18:32.591]  Nationwide, it was basically an 18-point difference in favor of Trump nationwide in our exit polling.
[03:18:32.591 --> 03:18:39.137]  So, when we get to the final results nationwide, there's a huge variance from what we have.
[03:18:40.109 --> 03:18:43.331]  I am concerned about what's going on with these states.
[03:18:43.331 --> 03:18:51.814]  I'm concerned what happened in Michigan only because the big argument is that it was a paper ballot, all paper ballots, all paper ballots.
[03:18:51.814 --> 03:19:03.820]  However, when they were late in reporting, they reported about a week after everybody else did, and they said one of the reasons why they were late was because there was a quote-unquote glitch in the system.
[03:19:03.820 --> 03:19:06.421]  That concerns me.
[03:19:06.421 --> 03:19:07.702]  In Wisconsin,
[03:19:09.057 --> 03:19:27.982]  I don't think there's anything founded there, but if they did a true investigation of Pennsylvania, I can tell you right now, there is without question voter fraud and election fraud that took place in Pennsylvania, and we have that documented.
[03:19:27.982 --> 03:19:31.443]  The problem is, is how do we go up against it?
[03:19:33.542 --> 03:19:48.832]  With this attack on the election, I feel like, you know, our team, that the Trump team, that the whole Liberty movement is sitting back on its heels and acting like this isn't a big deal.
[03:19:48.832 --> 03:19:51.194]  And I feel like it's a pretty big deal.
[03:19:51.194 --> 03:19:51.434]  All right.
[03:19:51.434 --> 03:19:52.494]  Thanks, Andy.
[03:19:52.494 --> 03:19:57.798]  Great organization, Vote Protectors, and thanks for joining us here with this great report on InfoWars.

[03:24:06.664 --> 03:24:07.886]  Welcome back!
[03:24:14.404 --> 03:24:23.187]  I'm Roger Stone filling in for Alex Jones and joining me today is Kate Komtemko who is a Trump activist here in Florida.
[03:24:23.187 --> 03:24:36.871]  Now I first saw Kate on Newsmax being interviewed by Steve Malzberg talking about music videos that she produced to help promote the election of Donald Trump and I was extraordinarily impressed.
[03:24:37.671 --> 03:24:50.213]  Because Kate is 16 years old, she writes, performs, edits, mixes her own music, and then edits her own music videos to go along with the soundtrack.
[03:24:51.173 --> 03:24:52.874]  These are really impressive.
[03:24:52.874 --> 03:24:56.777]  When we put them up at Stone Cold Truth, they got an enormous audience.
[03:24:56.777 --> 03:25:05.882]  I'm convinced that Kate Komtemko is a future revolutionary and that the talent she brings to the fight are really valued.
[03:25:05.882 --> 03:25:08.604]  So thanks for joining us here at InfoWars.
[03:25:08.604 --> 03:25:11.726]  Kate, why did you make the video we're going to show here in a moment?
[03:25:12.059 --> 03:25:22.464]  Well, I go to school and I helped organize some of the Trump rallies, but I really wanted to do something else and show my support in a different way.
[03:25:22.464 --> 03:25:24.205]  So I wrote the song.
[03:25:24.205 --> 03:25:26.066]  Pretty amazing.
[03:25:26.066 --> 03:25:29.148]  Let us go to the video because folks have got to see this.
[03:25:31.547 --> 03:25:36.651]  Shilling new ISIS propaganda video just surfacing, referencing the Paris attacks.
[03:25:36.651 --> 03:25:39.793]  Tonight the NYPD released a statement, New York City is a target.
[03:25:53.935 --> 03:26:16.141]  Every day, every night We keep on asking why A thousand lives sacrificed And still we return and fight All we ever hear Is the same old talk Empty promises about change Filled with lies and the fraud
[03:26:23.684 --> 03:26:47.241]  With that obsession With glory There's not a day To spend Let's make America great again It's time to act Back on the track The stakes are high And still they deny Terrorist attacks It never stops Enough with fake perfectness Political correctness
[03:26:50.974 --> 03:27:05.104]  Tell me how to comfort those people who lost their minds.
[03:27:11.832 --> 03:27:13.774]  We're good to go.
[03:27:27.952 --> 03:27:29.213]  We're good to go.
[03:27:57.579 --> 03:28:08.442]  Give us something real.
[03:28:08.442 --> 03:28:11.043]  Give us something true.
[03:28:11.043 --> 03:28:14.064]  Don't let it reach the end.
[03:28:14.064 --> 03:28:17.405]  Let's make America great again.
[03:28:20.845 --> 03:28:31.985]  It's time to act, back on that track The stakes are high, it's too late tonight To arrest the dogs, it never stops Enough with fake perfectness
[03:29:00.336 --> 03:29:23.039]  It's time to act, back on that track The stakes are high and still they deny Terrorist attacks, it never stops Enough with fake perfectness It's time to act, back on that track The stakes are high and still they deny Terrorist attacks, it never stops Enough with fake perfectness
[03:29:49.584 --> 03:29:50.986]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.986 --> 03:29:53.529]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.529 --> 03:29:56.213]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.353 --> 03:30:12.298]  In yet another disgusting example of the crimes committed against Trump supporters, we have an article that's up on our website, written by Paul Joseph Watson, entitled, Navy Vets Home Vandalized, Torched by, quote, Anti-Trump Extremists.
[03:30:12.298 --> 03:30:15.479]  Now, I'm talking about a Navy veteran with two young children at home.
[03:30:15.479 --> 03:30:21.501]  His house was vandalized with anti-Trump graffiti and racial slurs, both inside and out, before they torched the place.
[03:30:21.761 --> 03:30:27.425]  And yet another shocking example of anti-Trump hate crimes sweeping the country since we've seen Trump's victory.
[03:30:27.425 --> 03:30:35.371]  Now, the veteran Matthew Smith, who flies three flags in front of his house in Plant City, Florida, which are the American flag, the POW flag, and the U.S.
[03:30:35.371 --> 03:30:38.813]  Navy flag, says that he was targeted for his, quote, political beliefs.
[03:30:38.973 --> 03:30:41.154]  We should be figuring out our problems together.
[03:30:41.154 --> 03:30:49.599]  Now the word cracker was spray-painted in his house, and this suggests that the crime was racially motivated, most likely carried out by Black Lives Matter supporters.
[03:30:49.599 --> 03:30:56.422]  To make matters worse, Smith's home is in foreclosure, and they have no insurance to cover the belongings that were utterly destroyed in this fire.
[03:30:56.422 --> 03:30:59.324]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:30:59.944 --> 03:31:00.765]  Hey, everyone.
[03:31:00.765 --> 03:31:03.066]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[03:31:03.066 --> 03:31:06.908]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:31:06.908 --> 03:31:08.990]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:31:08.990 --> 03:31:19.256]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:31:19.256 --> 03:31:25.240]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:31:25.700 --> 03:31:42.550]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work,

[03:32:00.136 --> 03:32:04.818]  Charlie Daniels.
[03:32:04.818 --> 03:32:06.698]  He's always loved America.
[03:32:06.698 --> 03:32:08.479]  He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[03:32:08.479 --> 03:32:11.320]  Well, let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21.
[03:32:11.320 --> 03:32:15.481]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[03:32:15.481 --> 03:32:19.462]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective.
[03:32:19.462 --> 03:32:21.023]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[03:32:21.423 --> 03:32:22.984]  It's gonna be coming at you good.
[03:32:22.984 --> 03:32:23.485]  Oh yeah!
[03:32:23.485 --> 03:32:25.906]  I tell you, it ain't gonna set well down my way.
[03:32:25.906 --> 03:32:26.887]  At all.
[03:32:26.887 --> 03:32:27.948]  It ain't gonna set well.
[03:32:27.948 --> 03:32:30.150]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:32:30.150 --> 03:32:31.310]  It's time to ride, boys.
[03:32:31.310 --> 03:32:33.292]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[03:32:33.292 --> 03:32:38.816]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[03:32:38.816 --> 03:32:41.218]  Then beef was for supper.
[03:32:41.958 --> 03:32:44.420]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[03:32:44.420 --> 03:32:46.221]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[03:32:46.221 --> 03:32:47.922]  DVDs now available.
[03:32:47.922 --> 03:32:52.624]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.

[03:32:58.347 --> 03:32:59.128]  Let's fix it.
[03:33:11.613 --> 03:33:14.296]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:14.296 --> 03:33:19.341]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[03:33:26.580 --> 03:33:27.781]  Welcome back.
[03:33:27.781 --> 03:33:46.213]  I'm Roger Stone sitting in for Alex Jones here at InfoWars and now one of my favorite people, Sean Stone, actor, screenwriter, cinematographer, the son of legendary film producer and friend Oliver Stone joins us on InfoWars now.
[03:33:47.074 --> 03:33:50.036]  Sean and I met some years ago in Hollywood.
[03:33:50.036 --> 03:33:59.841]  Our politics are not exactly the same, but I respect him as an articulate advocate for his point of view, and I want to talk about his new book, The New World Order.
[03:33:59.841 --> 03:34:02.422]  So thanks for joining us here at InfoWars.
[03:34:02.422 --> 03:34:03.123]  Sean Stone.
[03:34:03.123 --> 03:34:05.164]  Roger, thank you.
[03:34:05.164 --> 03:34:05.764]  My namesake.
[03:34:07.592 --> 03:34:13.515]  I'm going to say right up front, we're not cousins, but we wish we were.
[03:34:13.515 --> 03:34:16.396]  So tell me about the New World Order.
[03:34:16.396 --> 03:34:24.759]  I wrote a book on the Bushes, and unfortunately for me it was called Jeb and the Bush Crime Family, and 11 days later
[03:34:27.268 --> 03:34:38.579]  After I think Jeb Bush read this book, he dropped out of the presidential race, and therefore the book never got the kind of focus that I wanted to get.
[03:34:38.579 --> 03:34:46.708]  But I was trying in that book to expose the New World Order, and I'm delighted to see that you're doing the same thing.
[03:34:47.941 --> 03:34:49.502]  Absolutely.
[03:34:49.502 --> 03:34:54.345]  You know, one of the central figures of the book is a man that you would have some familiarity with.
[03:34:54.345 --> 03:34:56.887]  That's Henry Kissinger.
[03:34:56.887 --> 03:35:01.950]  So, essentially, he was Kissinger's mentor at Harvard, William Mandel Elliott.
[03:35:01.950 --> 03:35:03.952]  He was a professor there for 40 years.
[03:35:03.952 --> 03:35:13.738]  Professor Moretti is a very influential person, not only on young Kissinger, but young Kaczynski, Sam Huntington, George Fundy.
[03:35:13.738 --> 03:35:17.721]  You know, he trained, he taught so many people, obviously, in the politics department.
[03:35:18.421 --> 03:35:29.345]  And at the same time, Elliott himself was very much under the tutelage of the roundtable groups that Carol Quigley had exposed with his tragedy and hope.
[03:35:29.345 --> 03:35:35.608]  So when I was looking at Elliott's sort of pedigree, right, his history in terms of assuming that position of power at Harvard,
[03:35:36.668 --> 03:35:54.310]  I recognize, wow, he's really very much a disciple of the Roundtable movement and their desire to essentially re-brand the British Empire, first as a British Commonwealth, and then, I think, essentially, I would say the New World Order is very much the British Commonwealth plus the United States.
[03:35:55.291 --> 03:36:06.713]  Operating under as much as possible international agreements, international laws, trying to basically institutionalize the destruction of nation-states.
[03:36:06.713 --> 03:36:09.814]  And they openly used the term New World Order.
[03:36:09.814 --> 03:36:12.214]  So it wasn't like I even had to say this was a conspiracy theory.
[03:36:12.214 --> 03:36:25.077]  I just said, look, they're quoting on various documents from the 20s, always in the 50s, this term New World Order very clearly in other think tank documents and their books that they're putting together, trying to basically formulate how we're going to control the world.
[03:36:25.077 --> 03:36:25.818]  We're good to go.
[03:36:41.215 --> 03:36:42.176]  We're good to go.
[03:37:02.726 --> 03:37:04.670]  We're good to go.
[03:37:14.059 --> 03:37:16.280]  Yeah, these are the seeds of globalism.
[03:37:16.280 --> 03:37:21.781]  Although, in this case, globalism led by the English-speaking nations, I guess.
[03:37:21.781 --> 03:37:30.463]  Kissinger has an interesting kind of trajectory because, of course, early in his career, he's considered a hardliner.
[03:37:30.463 --> 03:37:33.944]  He is considered the hardest of the hardliners.
[03:37:33.944 --> 03:37:39.226]  But when he sees a chance to emblazon his name in history,
[03:37:39.946 --> 03:37:49.328]  He really travels, he leaves his old comrades behind, and he very much becomes part of the globalist clique.
[03:37:49.328 --> 03:37:59.991]  I mean, frankly, when Donald Trump met with Dr. Kissinger in New York during the campaign, just after he wrapped up the Republican national nomination,
[03:38:01.809 --> 03:38:03.711]  It kind of sent a shudder up my back.
[03:38:03.711 --> 03:38:06.313]  You know, the hair on the back of my head was standing up.
[03:38:06.313 --> 03:38:12.419]  I think Kissinger's, you know, has left his moorings long ago.
[03:38:12.419 --> 03:38:13.700]  What are you looking for?
[03:38:13.700 --> 03:38:16.662]  Now, you have a movie out, as I recall.
[03:38:16.662 --> 03:38:17.984]  Tell me about your other project.
[03:38:18.740 --> 03:38:19.701]  Yeah, sure.
[03:38:19.701 --> 03:38:24.708]  So the other project is a documentary that we released on RT.
[03:38:24.708 --> 03:38:26.491]  RT.com is up there.
[03:38:26.491 --> 03:38:27.392]  You can watch the whole thing.
[03:38:27.392 --> 03:38:29.655]  It's called A Century of War.
[03:38:29.655 --> 03:38:32.038]  And it's relevant to the documentary.
[03:38:32.038 --> 03:38:33.119]  It's very much more of a
[03:38:34.441 --> 03:38:39.104]  We're looking, obviously, at the century of war being from 1917 to the present, the U.S.
[03:38:39.104 --> 03:38:47.068]  century of war since World War I, and how much we've expanded as this globalized, militarized empire.
[03:38:47.068 --> 03:38:48.209]  Really, I would say the U.S.
[03:38:48.209 --> 03:38:54.573]  is not an empire in itself, but there is a financial elite, and again, more of an Anglo-American empire that drives it.
[03:38:56.154 --> 03:39:00.336]  And we've seen this global domination by the military across the globe.
[03:39:00.336 --> 03:39:05.559]  But at the same time, we're seeing de-industrialization at home and a lack of the peace.
[03:39:05.559 --> 03:39:16.185]  Basically, we never resorted back to the peacetime industries that you would have seen, for example, all the way from the Civil War up through World War II was this tremendous growth and development.
[03:39:16.185 --> 03:39:19.187]  And it really carried over up into the 50s and 60s and 70s.
[03:39:19.187 --> 03:39:22.989]  But then by the mid-70s, when we went off the Bretton Woods system,
[03:39:23.649 --> 03:39:31.714]  We basically disconnected from manufacturing and having an industrial base at home and tariffs and things like this.
[03:39:31.714 --> 03:39:40.259]  We really started shifting after Nixon, I would say was really the breaking point, that they shifted hardcore into this global monetarist empire.
[03:39:40.259 --> 03:39:46.843]  And so the documentary looks at the consequence to America, really the de-industrialized epicenter,
[03:39:47.864 --> 03:40:03.276]  The former urban centers that are now very much decayed ghettos and whatnot in Baltimore, for example, Detroit, and obviously so many other cities that are decimated by these policies, but not just for the working class, but even the middle class is beginning to shrink.
[03:40:03.276 --> 03:40:13.963]  And really, they see the consequence of what happens when you essentially financialize your economy, when you turn it all over to the banks and to debt and replace people's real wages with debt.
[03:40:15.204 --> 03:40:16.925]  And that's what the document looks at.
[03:40:16.925 --> 03:40:20.005]  We also look at the nature of how we can move forward.
[03:40:20.005 --> 03:40:29.728]  Some of the things we really promote are breaking from the petrodollar economy, because ever since 73, 74, we basically replaced the gold standard with the oil standard, right?
[03:40:29.728 --> 03:40:41.730]  And that's very much been the only thing that's keeping the dollar, I would say, so strong in the world, despite the fact that our economy is, from a physical economy point of view, I think we've been failing.
[03:40:41.730 --> 03:40:44.251]  But we have this plethora of dollars because of
[03:40:44.831 --> 03:40:50.012]  We're having to pay for their oil through the dollar, right, all over the world.
[03:40:50.012 --> 03:40:51.732]  And that's basically sustained the U.S.
[03:40:51.732 --> 03:40:56.133]  currency, so it's a sort of fictional wealth that's taken over.
[03:40:56.133 --> 03:41:09.555]  And, you know, militarism, banking, you know, real estate, medicine, these are obviously major industries in this country, but I think most people are not seeing the prospects for their own future.
[03:41:09.555 --> 03:41:12.076]  And so we're trying to say, let's reinvigorate the American dream.
[03:41:12.076 --> 03:41:13.296]  How do we reinvigorate America?
[03:41:14.076 --> 03:41:29.145]  And I think it has to do with not just government spending, but also, you know, having smart spending in terms of infrastructure, things that, you know, people can obviously build, high speed rail systems, moving towards nuclear fission and fusion processes, cold fusion, for example, things that can replace the oil.
[03:41:29.445 --> 03:41:30.365]  We're good to go.
[03:41:58.901 --> 03:41:59.463]  To the 70s and 80s.
[03:42:02.125 --> 03:42:10.932]  Well of course I'm one who thinks that Nixon's closing the gold window is perhaps his single greatest mistake of his presidency.
[03:42:10.932 --> 03:42:19.479]  But Sean, the way you sound, maybe Donald Trump should put you in the cabinet because I think he's very deeply committed to rebuilding the infrastructure of America.
[03:42:19.479 --> 03:42:25.384]  The roads, the bridges, the tunnels, the harbors, the schools, the hospitals.
[03:42:25.384 --> 03:42:27.266]  This is a deep passion of his.
[03:42:27.266 --> 03:42:28.527]  I know that he is looking at
[03:42:29.304 --> 03:42:43.969]  A number of very innovative ways to finance infrastructure revitalization without having to add to our incredible and daunting national debt.
[03:42:43.969 --> 03:42:46.390]  He is, after all, a builder.
[03:42:46.390 --> 03:42:48.350]  And I think he has to build.
[03:42:48.350 --> 03:42:54.772]  This, I think, really connected with blue-collar Americans in this most recent election.
[03:42:54.772 --> 03:42:56.653]  Trump is absolutely right.
[03:42:57.433 --> 03:43:01.475]  Fly into LaGuardia Airport in New York sometime.
[03:43:01.475 --> 03:43:05.057]  You really do feel like you're flying into a third world country.
[03:43:05.057 --> 03:43:13.382]  It is run down, it is filthy, it is not efficient, and it looks like it was 1950.
[03:43:13.382 --> 03:43:17.123]  I mean, it is an abomination.
[03:43:17.123 --> 03:43:23.807]  Now, Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced a multi-billion dollar plan to redo the airport.
[03:43:23.807 --> 03:43:25.248]  There's only one minor problem.
[03:43:26.067 --> 03:43:28.669]  He doesn't have the money.
[03:43:28.669 --> 03:43:38.035]  So I think that you're going to see some innovative financial alternatives to rebuild our overall economy.
[03:43:38.035 --> 03:43:41.437]  I'm kind of interested in the fact that you're on RT.
[03:43:41.437 --> 03:43:45.340]  I've seen your show, Watching the Hawks, which I love.
[03:43:45.340 --> 03:43:49.323]  And as one who is accused of being a Russian asset,
[03:43:50.123 --> 03:43:59.208]  Of being a Russian spy, of filling my pockets with Russian money in the most recent election.
[03:43:59.208 --> 03:44:01.870]  I've got to believe working at RT is kind of an experience.
[03:44:01.870 --> 03:44:06.113]  I mean, I think the Russians were maligned in this election.
[03:44:06.113 --> 03:44:15.498]  We got to a point, it seemed to me, where if you weren't for thermonuclear war with the Russians over Syria, well then you must be a traitor to the United States.
[03:44:15.498 --> 03:44:18.460]  You must be in the employ of Putin.
[03:44:19.076 --> 03:44:21.417]  What's your take?
[03:44:21.417 --> 03:44:27.119]  You know, for a lot of us, I think that became the major issue for this election.
[03:44:27.119 --> 03:44:43.506]  I think people didn't quite account for that fact in Trump's victory, but a lot of people were very concerned about the foreign policy issue, that we feel there is a build-up to nuclear war, World War III with Russia, currently over Syria, which is the most insane story of all.
[03:44:43.506 --> 03:44:44.447]  I mean, it's like watching
[03:44:45.747 --> 03:44:58.757]  It's like watching 1984 with the Syria situation where every month the enemy changes and even a month ago, I think it was, or two months ago, Washington Post says, well, we can't destroy ISIS just yet because they're actually a stabilizing factor now.
[03:44:58.757 --> 03:45:03.761]  I mean, this is how insane our liberal establishment has become, so-called liberal establishment.
[03:45:03.761 --> 03:45:04.861]  It's an establishment.
[03:45:04.861 --> 03:45:10.626]  I think they play both liberal and conservative, but the point is that the establishment itself is insane about Syria.
[03:45:10.626 --> 03:45:12.787]  They're so dead set on getting rid of Assad.
[03:45:14.168 --> 03:45:21.094]  Overtly supporting Al-Qaeda related networks and ISIS related networks in Syria towards that end.
[03:45:21.094 --> 03:45:30.582]  And so because Russia is very much in favor of keeping Assad in power as a stabilizing force, that seems to become a red line.
[03:45:30.582 --> 03:45:37.228]  And a lot of people I think are very scared of what would have happened if Hillary came into power with her mentality that the Russians are
[03:45:39.136 --> 03:45:40.157]  Public enemy number one.
[03:45:40.157 --> 03:45:42.318]  It harpens back to the Cold War.
[03:45:42.318 --> 03:45:46.500]  A lot of people grew up with that mentality, so it's easy to fall back into that trap.
[03:45:46.500 --> 03:45:49.342]  But the fact is, we still have sanctions on Russia.
[03:45:49.342 --> 03:45:59.267]  The British, I think, are a major factor in that, because when you read my New World Order book, you'll recall that Russia was the enemy of the British, not the Americans.
[03:45:59.267 --> 03:46:03.990]  Russia is much more akin to America, you see, because it's a massive land-based country.
[03:46:04.870 --> 03:46:05.431]  We're good to go.
[03:46:29.953 --> 03:46:30.413]  We're good to go.
[03:46:53.951 --> 03:47:01.349]  So it's really interesting how Russia historically should have been our ally and has been pitted as the enemy because of, I believe, this Anglo-American alliance.
[03:47:03.183 --> 03:47:07.204]  Well, I think President-elect Trump favors a period of detente.
[03:47:07.204 --> 03:47:14.447]  I think he favors hard-headed negotiations with the Russians to see if we might coexist in peace.
[03:47:14.447 --> 03:47:17.588]  And for that, he was accused of treason.
[03:47:17.588 --> 03:47:25.050]  I'm not sure Americans understand how close the Obama-Clinton policies brought us to war with Russia.
[03:47:25.050 --> 03:47:26.171]  Now, we do need to
[03:47:28.117 --> 03:47:33.379]  Resolve the questions of Ukraine and the Crimea.
[03:47:33.379 --> 03:47:38.161]  But at the same time, I don't think nuclear war serves anyone.
[03:47:38.161 --> 03:47:45.965]  Also, going back to something you said, more and more as I've gotten older, I've come to believe that left and right is kind of a
[03:47:47.503 --> 03:47:48.804]  The ideology of power.
[03:47:48.804 --> 03:47:54.486]  At the end of the day, three out of ten of the Bernie Sanders voters voted for Donald Trump, I think on the issues of war.
[03:48:16.215 --> 03:48:19.118]  And on the issues of trade.
[03:48:19.118 --> 03:48:26.344]  And I thought from the beginning, my calculation was that had that been 2 out of 10, Trump would have lost.
[03:48:26.344 --> 03:48:42.338]  It was essential to get beyond the ideological labels for people to get to understand that in some ways, and on a number of key issues, Sanders and Trump had more in common than they had apart.
[03:48:43.138 --> 03:49:01.351]  And Trump's opponents for the nomination and Hillary Clinton were in fact neocons, a continuation of the Bush Clinton Bush Obama Clinton line of succession that was all planned out for us.
[03:49:01.351 --> 03:49:03.252]  So at the end of the day,
[03:49:04.153 --> 03:49:24.418]  There were a number of Union Democrats who probably still consider themselves liberals who ended up voting for Donald Trump, bringing him in Michigan, in Wisconsin, in Pennsylvania, the victory that so completely surprised the mainstream media.
[03:49:25.514 --> 03:49:31.178]  So, just to review, I'm urging people to go out and get your book, New World Order.
[03:49:31.178 --> 03:49:34.059]  I ordered it this morning on Amazon.
[03:49:34.059 --> 03:49:39.502]  I'm going to look up A Century of War, your documentary on RT.
[03:49:39.502 --> 03:49:43.465]  And lastly, just let me thank you for joining us here on InfoWars.
[03:49:43.465 --> 03:49:48.307]  Sean Stone, and I'll look you up next time I'm in Hollywood.
[03:49:48.307 --> 03:49:49.888]  Or New York or D.C.
[03:49:49.888 --> 03:49:52.190]  It's always a pleasure to see you.
[03:49:52.190 --> 03:49:52.710]  Thank you, Sean.
[03:49:52.710 --> 03:49:53.030]  Thank you.
[03:49:56.724 --> 03:49:57.965]  All right.
[03:49:57.965 --> 03:49:59.746]  Thank you very much for Sean Stone.
[03:49:59.746 --> 03:50:07.591]  I want to remind you again today that you can go to the InfoWars.com store.
[03:50:07.591 --> 03:50:09.452]  There's two products here I really like.
[03:50:09.452 --> 03:50:10.413]  One I have to mention.
[03:50:10.413 --> 03:50:16.177]  It's called Silver Bullet and it is a colloidal.
[03:50:16.177 --> 03:50:19.439]  About two weeks before the election, I was exhausted.
[03:50:19.439 --> 03:50:24.102]  I was putting in 18-hour days and I felt a cold coming on.
[03:50:24.742 --> 03:50:38.392]  Now, I had read that colloidals were very useful for boosting the immune system, and I immediately ordered a bottle of Silver Bullet, and I gotta tell you, it knocked my cold out.
[03:50:38.392 --> 03:50:40.514]  It's 50% off now.
[03:50:40.514 --> 03:50:42.856]  This is a terrific product.
[03:50:43.556 --> 03:50:45.719]  Uh, and it works prophylactically.
[03:50:45.719 --> 03:50:57.973]  So the minute you feel a cold coming on, I recommend it, uh, because it worked for me, and I was right back to the barricades after a couple, uh, of, uh, doses.
[03:50:57.973 --> 03:50:59.715]  Uh, it's a terrific product, folks.
[03:50:59.715 --> 03:51:01.297]  Helps support the revolution.
[03:51:01.297 --> 03:51:03.079]  The revolution is not just a heart tonic.
[03:51:03.439 --> 03:51:05.521]  Do you have any of these symptoms?
[03:51:05.521 --> 03:51:07.342]  Night cramps in the hands and feet?
[03:51:07.342 --> 03:51:09.564]  Your arms and legs often go to sleep?
[03:51:09.564 --> 03:51:12.265]  On short walks, do your legs get aches and pains?
[03:51:12.265 --> 03:51:14.407]  Is your memory worse than it used to be?
[03:51:14.407 --> 03:51:15.968]  Ankles that swell late in the day?
[03:51:15.968 --> 03:51:18.330]  Has your blood pressure increased lately?
[03:51:18.330 --> 03:51:24.895]  If you answered yes to even one of these questions, you may have early warning signs of arterial blockages.
[03:51:24.895 --> 03:51:27.797]  Your body is saying that it is time to take Xtendavite.
[03:51:28.317 --> 03:51:30.599]  These are not the normal signs of aging.
[03:51:30.599 --> 03:51:33.922]  They are the warning signs that accompany blocked arteries.

[03:52:59.983 --> 03:53:02.546]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[03:53:02.546 --> 03:53:04.628]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[03:53:04.628 --> 03:53:13.177]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house, like small refrigerators, to keep your food from spoiling.
[03:53:13.177 --> 03:53:15.620]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[03:53:15.620 --> 03:53:16.321]  It's mobile.
[03:53:16.321 --> 03:53:20.866]  To jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[03:53:21.306 --> 03:53:24.908]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity.
[03:53:24.908 --> 03:53:28.231]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[03:53:28.231 --> 03:53:29.231]  A true innovation.
[03:53:29.231 --> 03:53:31.233]  I have never seen anything like this.
[03:53:31.233 --> 03:53:32.914]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[03:53:32.914 --> 03:53:35.295]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[03:53:35.295 --> 03:53:39.398]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.

[03:54:16.782 --> 03:54:18.924]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:54:18.924 --> 03:54:23.088]  I'm Roger Stone, filling in for the great Alex Jones.
[03:54:23.088 --> 03:54:26.111]  Big, big, big shoes to fill.
[03:54:26.111 --> 03:54:29.674]  Today, I have a couple breaking news announcements.
[03:54:29.674 --> 03:54:30.815]  First and most important,
[03:54:31.736 --> 03:54:41.421]  The Hillary for prison 2017 t-shirts are now available at Infowars.com.
[03:54:41.421 --> 03:54:43.882]  This is a fight that is not yet over.
[03:54:43.882 --> 03:54:48.885]  Either we are a land of laws or we are a nation of men.
[03:54:49.705 --> 03:54:53.766]  We've been told repeatedly that no person is above the law.
[03:54:53.766 --> 03:54:57.607]  That means no woman is above the law either.
[03:54:57.607 --> 03:55:12.210]  So, let your neighbors know, let all Americans know that we demand that the justice system run its course and that the decision about prosecuting Hillary Clinton be made not by the President, but by a grand jury.
[03:55:12.890 --> 03:55:15.372]  And by a judicial process.
[03:55:15.372 --> 03:55:26.421]  So help us demand the prosecution of the Clintons by getting your Hillary for Prison 2017 t-shirt available at the Infowars.com store now.
[03:55:26.421 --> 03:55:29.964]  I'm going to be giving these out for Christmas as well.
[03:55:29.964 --> 03:55:33.426]  The other decision, pardon me, the other announcement I want to make
[03:55:34.386 --> 03:55:54.017]  Uh, is that my new book, The Making of the President 2016, How Donald Trump Orchestrated an American Revolution, is now available for pre-order at amazon.com or barnesandnoble.com, and very soon will be available at the Infowars store.
[03:55:54.017 --> 03:56:01.901]  Now, this is an insider's view of how Donald Trump got to the White House, and it starts way back in the beginning, 1988.
[03:56:03.982 --> 03:56:15.158]  When Donald Trump first made a trip to New Hampshire to speak to the Portsmouth, New Hampshire Chamber of Commerce, and the very first draft Trump for president committee was founded.
[03:56:16.308 --> 03:56:22.852]  We take you through 2000 when Trump seriously considered running as a candidate for the U.S.
[03:56:22.852 --> 03:56:29.416]  Reform Party, the party of Ross Perot and my good friend Jesse Ventura.
[03:56:29.416 --> 03:56:37.802]  Then we are going to chart the meteoric rise of Trump to the head of the pack in this year's presidential contest.
[03:56:38.814 --> 03:56:52.337]  First, we touch on 2012 and the fact that he briefly led Mitt Romney in the national Republican polls, in the end made the error, I think he would admit that, of endorsing Romney.
[03:56:52.337 --> 03:57:02.280]  And then fast forward to 2016, where he zooms to the head of the PAC, and then enters into a death struggle with Hillary Clinton.
[03:57:03.393 --> 03:57:06.056]  This is a fight about globalism.
[03:57:06.056 --> 03:57:16.829]  This is both a big picture look at the 2016 election in the style of Theodore H. White's famous Making of the President series, 1960, 1964, 1968.
[03:57:20.754 --> 03:57:28.117]  But it's also going to give you behind-the-scenes vignettes of what was really happening in Trump land.
[03:57:28.117 --> 03:57:41.602]  This is a book that I know Donald Trump will like, and we chart the rise of the alternative conservative media and the impact of Infowars in my new book, The Making of the President 2016.
[03:57:41.602 --> 03:57:45.703]  I urge you to go to Amazon or Barnes & Noble to grab this now.
[03:57:45.703 --> 03:57:49.525]  I believe it will be the first definitive inside look
[03:57:50.422 --> 03:57:55.443]  On how Donald Trump pulled the greatest political upset in U.S.
[03:57:55.443 --> 03:57:56.543]  history.
[03:57:56.543 --> 03:57:59.704]  Thank you for having me here on InfoWars.
[03:57:59.704 --> 03:58:01.724]  It has been a great experience.
[03:58:01.724 --> 03:58:05.045]  Keep an eye on that Wisconsin recount.
[03:58:05.045 --> 03:58:06.225]  It's a phony.
[03:58:06.225 --> 03:58:09.905]  They have produced no evidence of voter fraud.
[03:58:09.905 --> 03:58:12.126]  But we must be vigilant.
[03:58:12.126 --> 03:58:15.586]  So keep the faith and victory or death.
[03:58:40.652 --> 03:58:44.176]  You are listening to GCN.
