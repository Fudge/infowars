[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:10.000 --> 00:17.000]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:17.000 --> 00:45.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:45.000 --> 00:52.000]  Governor Ron DeSantis signed an anti-groomer bill into law that prevents school teachers
[00:52.000 --> 00:59.000]  from engaging five-year-olds about homosexual sex acts and radical transgender ideology.
[00:59.000 --> 01:06.000]  The groomers have come out of the woodwork and many people are waking up to the dark side of Disney.
[01:06.000 --> 01:12.000]  Investigative journalist Christopher Rufo has outlined a partial list of Disney employees
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  who have been arrested for child sex crimes.
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.000]  Robert Kingsolver was a service manager who oversaw ride repairs at the Magic Kingdom.
[01:22.000 --> 01:29.000]  He was arrested in 2014 for soliciting sex from an agent posing as a 14-year-old girl.
[01:29.000 --> 01:37.000]  Alan Treister, a concierge at Animal Kingdom Lodge who used to work at Disney's popular toy story ride,
[01:37.000 --> 01:47.000]  advertised himself online as big teddy bear for younger chaser and confessed to having sex with a 15-year-old boy he groomed online.
[01:47.000 --> 01:55.000]  Animal Kingdom Lodge gift shop worker Paul Fazio was convicted of downloading child pornography videos
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  showing sexual activity with adults and children.
[01:59.000 --> 02:10.000]  Character actor Patrick Holgerson was arrested in 2014 after sending nude photos online while trying to meet up with a 13-year-old boy.
[02:10.000 --> 02:18.000]  Justin Hazan, an operator on the Millennium Falcon ride and Arlandra Sims, a food runner at the Animal Kingdom Resort,
[02:18.000 --> 02:25.000]  were busted in 2020 for selling child pornography with victims as young as four years old.
[02:25.000 --> 02:33.000]  Disney Cruise Line youth host Oliver Levotte was arrested in 2019 for molesting a 10-year-old boy
[02:33.000 --> 02:42.000]  aboard the Disney Magic ship's Oceania Kids Lab after blindfolding the child and spinning him around several times as part of a game.
[02:42.000 --> 02:50.000]  In 2012, an 11-year-old girl was groped and kissed in an elevator by 33-year-old Milton Braganza,
[02:50.000 --> 02:53.000]  a dining server on the Disney Dream.
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.000]  A Cruise Line security officer was told by Disney officials to keep her mouth shut and do nothing.
[02:59.000 --> 03:06.000]  Two days later, when the ship arrived in Nassau, Braganza admitted to the Bahamas police that he molested the girl
[03:06.000 --> 03:13.000]  and was then taken to the airport, where Disney arranged for his flight back home to India.
[03:13.000 --> 03:22.000]  Last year, Hollywood Studios custodians Jonathan McGrew and Savannah Lawrence were caught attempting to have a threesome with a 13-year-old.
[03:22.000 --> 03:28.000]  McGrew said that the couple's fantasy was to play step-dad, step-daughter, step-mother.
[03:28.000 --> 03:35.000]  Animal Kingdom Lodge lifeguard Kenneth Aquino was arrested after trying to have sex with a 13-year-old,
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  showing up in his Disney work clothes.
[03:38.000 --> 03:45.000]  Of course, child predators will naturally seek employment at Disney, but it's everywhere within the company.
[03:45.000 --> 03:54.000]  Director of music publishing John Healy was charged with three felony counts of child sexual abuse in 2017.
[03:54.000 --> 04:01.000]  Vice President Michael Laney was convicted of sexually abusing a seven-year-old girl in 2019.
[04:01.000 --> 04:12.000]  Both actor-producer Brian Peck and director Victor Salva were rehired by Disney after they served time for raping children from the set.
[04:12.000 --> 04:22.000]  The subliminal sexualization of children has demonstrably been a part of Disney's work for generations, embedded into their animations.
[04:22.000 --> 04:31.000]  Several whistleblowers have claimed that Disney has been used since its very beginning as a form of mind control and MK Ultra,
[04:31.000 --> 04:37.000]  most famously for their project monarch princess programming of Little Girls.
[04:37.000 --> 04:48.000]  So it's really no surprise that Disney's corporate president admittedly wants to flood Disney stories with the so-called LGBTQIA agenda,
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  which we now understand to be code for pedophilia.
[04:52.000 --> 05:18.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[05:18.000 --> 05:33.000]  I'm Greg Rees.
[05:33.000 --> 06:01.000]  I'm Greg Rees.
[06:01.000 --> 06:22.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[06:22.000 --> 06:32.000]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[06:32.000 --> 06:52.000]  It's Chancellor Sutton.
[06:52.000 --> 07:20.000]  It's Chancellor Sutton.
[07:20.000 --> 07:28.000]  I know why you did it.
[07:28.000 --> 07:33.000]  I know you were afraid, who would it be? War, terror, disease?
[07:33.000 --> 07:39.000]  There were a myriad of problems which inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[07:39.000 --> 07:46.000]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[07:46.000 --> 07:59.000]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[07:59.000 --> 08:07.000]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose sides has come.
[08:07.000 --> 08:18.000]  We are the resistance. We are the Infowar.
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.000]  Evil has been growing and building its power in the shadows.
[08:23.000 --> 08:31.000]  And now, with every day you see what appears to be unlimited energy by the forces of Satan,
[08:31.000 --> 08:40.000]  as they expand and launch massive attacks across our planet against the devil's enemy.
[08:40.000 --> 08:50.000]  Humanity, ladies and gentlemen, what an incredible time to be alive, what an incredible time to be here with you on air,
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  being able to speak with you, being able to talk with you.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  What a blessing.
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.000]  I went to the grocery store last night to get some groceries. We'd run out of some basics.
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  And almost every section was 90 to 80% empty.
[09:06.000 --> 09:18.000]  And it just was emblematic of what's happening, where even in Texas, one of the most independent states for food and energy and transportation,
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.000]  you name it, that there wasn't enough food.
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.000]  And I asked some of the stalkers, and I said, is this just because it's Sunday night?
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.000]  They said, no, it's like this a lot now.
[09:28.000 --> 09:35.000]  Other areas like the East Coast that don't grow their own food, like Florida or Texas or California, they're just empty.
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  And the prices were massive.
[09:37.000 --> 09:41.000]  About one red onion for three times what prices were just a few months ago.
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  And here's what I'm talking about right here. It's an article on Infowars.com from Zero Hedge.
[09:45.000 --> 09:52.000]  The formula shortages hit Walgreens as rationing begins.
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  And all over the country, basic staples are running out.
[09:55.000 --> 10:02.000]  Now, this was all done by devaluation of currencies and around the world two years of lockdown.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  But it's all blamed on Russia.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  And if it was Russia's fault, great, easy to blame them, we could deal with Russia.
[10:07.000 --> 10:13.000]  No, it's the New World Order, a much more formidable enemy, because their agents have penetrated.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  I'm going to put the live show feed on screen for people.
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.000]  Their agents have penetrated almost every government on Earth.
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  In China, in Russia, in India, even countries you think aren't aligned with the globalists, they're just as bad.
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  In fact, China is the model of it.
[10:27.000 --> 10:30.000]  They are infiltrated, as Klaus Schwab said a few months ago.
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.000]  We have penetrated all the cabinets and have 50% control now.
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  No one can stop us.
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  We will collapse the economy and bring in the new system.
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  There's a headline.
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.000]  Next level transmission.
[10:46.000 --> 10:52.000]  Learn why globalists are triggering a complete collapse in the end of the world as we know it.
[10:52.000 --> 10:53.000]  That's not talk.
[10:53.000 --> 10:54.000]  That's not hyperbole.
[10:54.000 --> 10:57.000]  That's not hyper-rhetoric.
[10:57.000 --> 11:00.000]  That's reality.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  And you know, behind the scenes, you've noticed I've not been on air a lot lately,
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  because of the globalists, the Democrats, their lawsuits, but other things.
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.000]  There are other attacks that I'm not liberty to get into yet.
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.000]  They're the most intense ever that are spiritual, that are like the Matrix movie or the Twilight Zone.
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  And I'm dealing with that, and I knew we would get to this point.
[11:20.000 --> 11:21.000]  But let me explain something.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  The Bible talks about, as you enter the end times, hell will be opened.
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.000]  Only a portion of Satan's legions were upon the earth before.
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  Now the full legions are being released.
[11:32.000 --> 11:33.000]  The operatives.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  And people go, this sounds cookie.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  Well, the Bible says an off-world creature is marooned here
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.000]  and has millions of agents that work for him that are eternal.
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  And that's what we're facing.
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.000]  And the Bible said their goal, a world government, ten kings, three mega-regions,
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.000]  total control at the end of the family, forced injections, a mark to mine cell.
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  You must worship the beast.
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  That means do what it says, follow its religion, a political correctness,
[11:59.000 --> 12:05.000]  or you won't eat, you won't be able to travel, you won't be able to live, you will die.
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.000]  And you have all these pathetic Satanists and minions of this that rolled over to it
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  during the good times, a little taste of power.
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  And now it's all running out very, very quickly.
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  And they're all going to eat their own.
[12:19.000 --> 12:23.000]  It's going to be a spectacular disaster.
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  Yeah, there's the head of the Rothschild family,
[12:25.000 --> 12:31.000]  with the head Alistair Crowley witch, Abramovich.
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.000]  And there she is with the painting of Lucifer summoning his legions.
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  Great job, crew, with the TV viewers.
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  Hold on up in like ten seconds.
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  We don't script, we're going to put up, they just hear what I say and they riff off it.
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.000]  I'm like, jazz.
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  I'm going to ask all listeners for this though right now,
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.000]  because I know we're a focal point and the enemy's coming against us,
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.000]  everything's got on all levels.
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  And I just want you to know that we can be off the air in just weeks
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  with the things that are being done behind the scenes against us.
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  And I don't fear that.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  The reason I'm concerned is that means it's very close for all of you.
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  When they pull out the knife to finally stab me,
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.000]  politically, culturally, spiritually, sexually, every level,
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  at that point I know when I let them stab me,
[13:16.000 --> 13:22.000]  that we are entering the end of the system.
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  And that means a hell, I can't imagine, you can't imagine.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  I've got a confession to make.
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  I've not had the will as of late to even tell you what's coming next
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  because it's so horrible to speak it aloud.
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.000]  And I have been really guilty that I know what's going to happen
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  and I have not been able to say it.
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.000]  Because it's just, I don't want, I know it's my job to do it
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  and I'm being spurred to do it by God.
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.000]  And it's just such a big task to lay this out
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  that I have a lot of trouble.
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.000]  But I told you just a few years ago you'd soon see pedos in Congress
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  and in the news and the owners of the company saying,
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  we want your children, we're going to have your children,
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  we're going to groom your children, we're going to have sex with them.
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  And now all the mainstream media, Disney, everything is saying,
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.000]  we want your kids, we're going to teach them how to have sex,
[14:13.000 --> 14:14.000]  we're going to have sex with them.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  Because that's destroying the future, it's destroying love,
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  it's destroying people meeting each other and liking each other
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  and having a relationship and forming a family.
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.000]  It is destroying God's most powerful ritual on this planet,
[14:25.000 --> 14:32.000]  the union of men and women coming together through love.
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  And we'll cover that when we come back.
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  But we can look at all the other news,
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  we can talk about all the global developments
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  and talk about the food shortages and everything that's happening.
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  But at the end of the day, God says they're going to come after our children
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  and they're going to give them the fires of mullet.
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  They can throw them right in the fire and burn them up,
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  and they'll do it quick and do it.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  But they have to have other ways to get it done.
[14:54.000 --> 15:04.000]  They have to have other systems to be able to carry that out.
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  And that's what we're witnessing.
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.000]  That's what we're living through here today.
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  So I just pray to the Creator of the universe,
[15:14.000 --> 15:20.000]  the God of everything, the spirit that is all-knowing and is infinite.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  Pour out your will upon us so that we can stand against this evil
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  and you give us the will and the foresight and the discernment
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  and the courage to follow through with your plans
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  and help us be clean, ready vessels for your spirit
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  in this great challenge to march forward
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  and stand against the enemy as it throws all its weight against us
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  because we forgot you and we turned our backs on you
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  and so you open the gates, you lowered the defense system,
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  the shields are down, and you're showing us that you will not protect us
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  if we do not stand with you.
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  Please help us, God.
[15:52.000 --> 15:57.000]  And God says your people must plead and bring themselves before me
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  and get on their knees and repent.
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand in Fort Worth.
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.000]  I've been on the air a couple of years,
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.000]  but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films,
[16:11.000 --> 16:14.000]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  And it was a t-shirt I designed, the first one,
[16:16.000 --> 16:19.000]  Mass Murderers Agreed, Gun Control Works,
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.000]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew.
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.000]  That's our oldest design and we're still selling.
[16:25.000 --> 16:27.000]  We have that design over a hundred others
[16:27.000 --> 16:29.000]  that will now all be limited editions
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  because whatever shop we've got in,
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  that's it, we're selling everything out
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  to find the operation, to get rid of inventory.
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future.
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  There'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts,
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  this is your last chance.
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  I almost forgot, we're selling them all at cost
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.000]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie,
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  every long sleeve, every t-shirt,
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  regular shirts, designer shirts,
[16:56.000 --> 17:11.000]  we're selling at cost at infowarstore.com.
[17:27.000 --> 17:30.000]  We've got great products, thousands of them,
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  at infowarstore.com and we are funded by

[19:25.000 --> 19:28.000]  Thank you for watching us of Build Back Better.
[19:28.000 --> 19:31.000]  This is nothing more than a top-down
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  vertical consolidation of the world economy
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  because they couldn't take our guns
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  and because we wouldn't bow
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  because the left, which is the ideology
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  of this world government system, couldn't win.
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  Now we know, two years ago,
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  It's that simple.
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  They can't maybe because of our free speech
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.000]  so the global corporate combined released COVID-19
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  and you know the rest is history.
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[20:00.000 --> 20:03.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[20:03.000 --> 20:18.000]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:18.000 --> 20:31.000]  Info wars, because there's a war on for your mind.
[20:31.000 --> 20:33.000]  Well, you read about those times in history
[20:33.000 --> 20:36.000]  where the world goes crazy and 20, 30, 40%
[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  of the population, sometimes 50, dies.
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.000]  Hell, sometimes whole civilizations in Europe,
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  in Mesoamerica, in Africa, in Asia,
[20:46.000 --> 20:51.000]  in the steppes just disappear, everybody dies.
[20:51.000 --> 20:55.000]  And they find big mask raves of people
[20:55.000 --> 21:00.000]  that have been eaten with human tooth marks
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.000]  chewing the meat off the bones.
[21:04.000 --> 21:08.000]  Yeah, they found a bunch of places in France
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.000]  and in Germany and in Africa and in the Americas.
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  It didn't matter if it was Native Americans,
[21:14.000 --> 21:17.000]  it didn't matter if it was Germans, it didn't matter if it was Africans.
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.000]  They just suddenly would see like villages themselves
[21:20.000 --> 21:23.000]  because they find the same headdresses, the same accoutrements,
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  the same tribal artifacts.
[21:25.000 --> 21:28.000]  Villages would just go crazy and go from being really successful
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  and great to killing and war and then eating each other.
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  Just a few years ago they found a town in Germany
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  with hundreds of thousands of skeletons
[21:38.000 --> 21:43.000]  just all over eaten by other humans.
[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  Why did they do that?
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  Most cases it's not famine.
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.000]  Something happens, a spirit comes in
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.000]  and by increment we become more evil, more corrupt, more animalistic
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  and then everything spirals out of control and we kill each other.
[22:02.000 --> 22:05.000]  Every culture has sacrificed its children.
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.000]  I don't care if you've got a Native American background
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.000]  or an Asian background or an African background
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  or a white background.
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  You got one thing in common,
[22:16.000 --> 22:19.000]  your ancestors at one point or another,
[22:19.000 --> 22:23.000]  eight children, burned children, tortured children,
[22:23.000 --> 22:26.000]  cut children's hearts out,
[22:26.000 --> 22:29.000]  froze children to death, gave them the moloch,
[22:29.000 --> 22:32.000]  threw them into fiery pits.
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  Where is this coming from?
[22:34.000 --> 22:38.000]  Why is it in the Old Testament and carved on Egyptian hieroglyphics?
[22:38.000 --> 22:43.000]  Was it Ramses II's father ordered all Israelite firstborns
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.000]  to be killed, males?
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  That's just one group he ordered to kill.
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  You know how they were killed? By the sword.
[22:51.000 --> 22:55.000]  He didn't do it in a ritual, but it was still a ritual.
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.000]  And now we kill our firstborn with Ritalin and Prozac.
[22:58.000 --> 23:04.000]  Now we kill them with abortion, the firstborn son.
[23:04.000 --> 23:08.000]  If something happens, they know in all mammals,
[23:08.000 --> 23:12.000]  in the first birth of a female with the first sperm and first egg,
[23:12.000 --> 23:18.000]  there is a particular metaphysical electromagnetic activation
[23:18.000 --> 23:24.000]  of epigenetical information within that new forming entity
[23:24.000 --> 23:30.000]  that has transmitted the sum total of the genetic memory
[23:30.000 --> 23:37.000]  of the species through those bloodlines.
[23:37.000 --> 23:40.000]  And when the ruling cult of the planet senses that those bloodlines
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  are fighting the tyranny and fighting the takeover,
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  and parents sense it and don't know what to do,
[23:45.000 --> 23:50.000]  it electrochemically and fifth and sixth dimensionally
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.000]  programs the cells for the sperms and the eggs
[23:53.000 --> 23:57.000]  to produce the next group that will inherently know
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.000]  how to answer and defeat it. And so the only answer
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  the Satanists have is kill the children
[24:02.000 --> 24:05.000]  because it's going to be those incredible children
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  of every race, color, and creed, one race,
[24:07.000 --> 24:15.000]  the human race that are going to lead us out of this.
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  Because those aren't just children.
[24:17.000 --> 24:23.000]  Those are men and women. Those are leaders.
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.000]  We hear about how men are bad and masculinity is evil
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  in universities and governments.
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  Men just aren't good. Men are essential.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  Because when we've got men that stand up and have honor
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  and duty to their family and their culture and their country,
[24:38.000 --> 24:41.000]  then they stand against evil.
[24:41.000 --> 24:44.000]  But in this world we're told men that dress like women or women
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.000]  and that women should act like men and that really masculine men
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  that are real men are a bad commodity.
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  That's because an alien off-world force,
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.000]  it's spiritual, it's interdimensional, it has a transmission,
[24:58.000 --> 25:05.000]  it has a spirit, but it also has agents, aliens, demons.
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  And they are working against us around the clock
[25:08.000 --> 25:14.000]  because they know we are about to go from our embryonic level
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.000]  to birthing into the next level.
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.000]  And that we're going to go from that pupa,
[25:23.000 --> 25:29.000]  that chrysalis, that cocoon,
[25:29.000 --> 25:34.000]  and like a butterfly become the next phase
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  of what God has in store.
[25:37.000 --> 25:41.000]  And they don't want that.
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  They have a jealousy and a deep hatred for our beauty
[25:46.000 --> 25:51.000]  and our power and our glory.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  They're ever seeking, ever working to take that away
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  and to sabotage us and to hurt us.
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.000]  But they know once we grow older we become strong.
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.000]  If we're allowed to have a decent path and find God ourselves
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.000]  and find God's universe ourselves, we become strong.
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  But if they can hijack us when we're little babies,
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.000]  they can get us when we're tiny and screw us up
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.000]  and then teach us to the Stockholm Syndrome to serve the system
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  to the LGBTQTP, then they've wrecked someone
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  that they can maintain control over for the rest of their lives,
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  that they can then dominate, that they can then own,
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.000]  that will be their slave forever.
[26:35.000 --> 26:40.000]  Armies of effeminate, anorexic men dressed as women saying,
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  I need access to first graders.
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.000]  I need access to second and third and fourth and fifth graders.
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  I need access to three-year-olds.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  I've got a clip I'll play next segment.
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  Hell, let's play it right now.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  Non-binary elementary teacher says three-year-olds are old enough
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.000]  to learn about gender from them to form a sexual relationship with them.
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  Identity and sexual orientation and pronouns.
[27:06.000 --> 27:12.000]  Listen to the groomers as they launch.
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.000]  Hi, I'm a queer teacher and I 1,000% do not support this bill.
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  And yes, I do know what's in it.
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  Filling itself is just another way to stigmatize the LGBTQ plus community.
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.000]  Kids as young as three and four are actually aware of their gender identity,
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  even if they don't have the language for it.
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.000]  So very aware of who they like and who they don't like.
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.000]  Heterosexuality is pushing our kids on a daily basis at a very young age.
[27:35.000 --> 27:38.000]  Media through books, the first Disney movie that you saw.
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.000]  Say that pre-K through third grade are not ready for such topics
[27:42.000 --> 27:45.000]  is actually internalized homophobia and transphobia.
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  We're very much ready for these topics and are way more accepting than adults
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  when it comes to discussing these topics.
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  We can talk about gender, gender assumptions, pronouns, all the things.
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  And it is child development appropriate and age appropriate.
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.000]  It's literally created as just another means to other queer people.
[28:02.000 --> 28:07.000]  Basically say that us existing is not normal.
[28:07.000 --> 28:12.000]  They say accept us and then you've got to quote be us.
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.000]  And it's men in clown outfits wanting to have access to children
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.000]  and weirdos saying we're politically correct and bringing them to them.
[28:20.000 --> 28:23.000]  This is the enemy's full assault, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.000]  This is the next level of the New World Order.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  And you know, I aired an old piece we made like five years ago about body snatchers
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  compared to Democrats and how crazy they are.
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  But that's what is spirit snatchers.
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.000]  We're going to air that when we come back and then I've got more clips of this.
[28:38.000 --> 28:42.000]  And then Elon Musk coming out saying stop the censorship at Twitter.
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  A bunch of war news, a bunch of economic news.
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  A bunch of the FBI got caught in a big false flag.
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.000]  In Michigan, as you know, Jerry found folks non-guilty.
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  This is such a huge deal.
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  We've got a bunch of special guests, Ali Alexander and others coming up.
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  Please stay with us.
[28:56.000 --> 29:06.000]  Over the years, Info Wars has produced more than 200 amazing Patriot Americana
[29:06.000 --> 29:11.000]  Second Amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts, ball caps, flags.
[29:11.000 --> 29:16.000]  You name it. All of the apparel and the flags are being sold at cost right now.
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  That's just regular plain chain shirts.
[29:18.000 --> 29:24.000]  That is all sorts of designer shirts that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[29:24.000 --> 29:28.000]  We used to sell for $40, we're selling them for $15, selling them for $20.
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  Whatever the shirt costs us, the shirt costs $5.
[29:30.000 --> 29:33.000]  We're selling it for $5 for essentially produce.
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  It costs $10, we're selling it for $10.
[29:35.000 --> 29:39.000]  And we've got hoodies and we've got long sleeves and we've got short sleeves.
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  We've got them all and we've got to liquidate them all.
[29:41.000 --> 29:45.000]  And they're limited edition because we're never going to make any of these designs.
[29:45.000 --> 29:51.000]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[29:51.000 --> 29:55.000]  We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air, plus it spreads the word.
[29:55.000 --> 29:59.000]  infowarstore.com, your historic apparel now, infowarstore.com.
[29:59.000 --> 30:01.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[30:01.000 --> 30:05.000]  I need your help keeping M4s on the air and strong.
[30:05.000 --> 30:09.000]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  I was born for this. You were born for this.
[30:11.000 --> 30:16.000]  And people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our own infrastructure
[30:16.000 --> 30:20.000]  because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[30:20.000 --> 30:24.000]  And now, with Band-Aid video getting close to 10 million views a day,
[30:24.000 --> 30:28.000]  we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups
[30:28.000 --> 30:32.000]  to be able to post their content free of charge.
[30:32.000 --> 30:36.000]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[30:36.000 --> 30:40.000]  Infowars and Band-Aid video have become a mothership
[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  promoting the pro-human-liberty movement worldwide.
[30:42.000 --> 30:47.000]  But the expenses in Band-Width alone are millions of dollars a quarter,
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[30:49.000 --> 30:52.000]  So, the biggest sale in Infowars history is going right now,
[30:52.000 --> 30:55.000]  the mega-emergency blowout sale up to 75% off,
[30:55.000 --> 30:59.000]  getting incredible products and keeping Infowars as strong as ever.
[30:59.000 --> 31:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Infowarsstore.com is offering the biggest sales
[31:05.000 --> 31:08.000]  in its over 20-year history.
[31:08.000 --> 31:11.000]  And that is because the economy is breaking down,
[31:11.000 --> 31:15.000]  inflation is exploding, the supply chains are broken down,
[31:15.000 --> 31:20.000]  and Infowars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for operations.
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists
[31:24.000 --> 31:25.000]  making their main move.
[31:25.000 --> 31:27.000]  Infowars, it's paradoxical.
[31:27.000 --> 31:29.000]  It's more popular than ever.
[31:29.000 --> 31:31.000]  It's reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[31:31.000 --> 31:35.000]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.000]  and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else,
[31:37.000 --> 31:39.000]  we are running out of money.
[31:39.000 --> 31:43.000]  So listen, up to 75% off at Infowarsstore.com
[31:43.000 --> 31:47.000]  on things like amazing Patriot t-shirts that help spread the word
[31:47.000 --> 31:51.000]  and fund the operation, on supplements, on books, on films.
[31:51.000 --> 31:54.000]  Everything is 25 to 75% off right now.
[31:54.000 --> 31:57.000]  The biggest sale in our history at Infowarsstore.com.
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  Thank you for your support.
[31:59.000 --> 32:05.000]  In December of 2021, Infowars offered the first in a three-part series,
[32:05.000 --> 32:08.000]  the 1776 Anti-Tyrant Coin.
[32:08.000 --> 32:11.000]  And it sold out in 10 days.
[32:11.000 --> 32:15.000]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin,
[32:15.000 --> 32:19.000]  a founding member coin, we would not be on air today.
[32:19.000 --> 32:23.000]  Now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin, is being offered.
[32:23.000 --> 32:26.000]  And it will probably sell out in 10 days again.
[32:26.000 --> 32:29.000]  It certainly needs to, to fund our operation.
[32:29.000 --> 32:31.000]  It is so historic.
[32:31.000 --> 32:34.000]  And it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty
[32:34.000 --> 32:38.000]  being refreshed with the blood of Patriots in Tyrants and more.
[32:38.000 --> 32:42.000]  Get the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com.
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.000]  It's also at Infowarsstore.com.
[32:44.000 --> 32:45.000]  It's amazing.
[32:45.000 --> 32:47.000]  There's only 10,000 of them.
[32:47.000 --> 32:50.000]  And as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air,
[32:50.000 --> 32:53.000]  we're planning something very, very special for everyone
[32:53.000 --> 32:55.000]  that helps us go to the next level.
[32:55.000 --> 33:10.000]  You'll get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[33:25.000 --> 33:30.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:30.000 --> 33:37.000]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[33:37.000 --> 33:40.000]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread.
[33:40.000 --> 33:44.000]  And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to SCUM.
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.000]  We're beholden to SCUM.
[33:46.000 --> 33:55.000]  The Russian SCUM.
[33:55.000 --> 33:57.000]  Please listen.
[33:57.000 --> 34:01.000]  If you don't, if you won't, if you fail to understand,
[34:01.000 --> 34:05.000]  then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you.
[34:05.000 --> 34:09.000]  The function of all life is survival.
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  Sleep.
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  Sleep.
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  They're coming.
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  They're coming.
[34:19.000 --> 34:20.000]  Help.
[34:20.000 --> 34:21.000]  Help.
[34:21.000 --> 34:22.000]  They're coming.
[34:22.000 --> 34:23.000]  They're coming.
[34:23.000 --> 34:24.000]  Listen to me.
[34:24.000 --> 34:25.000]  Listen.
[34:25.000 --> 34:26.000]  Help me.
[34:26.000 --> 34:27.000]  Your next, please.
[34:27.000 --> 34:28.000]  Please.
[34:28.000 --> 34:29.000]  Your next, they're in danger.
[34:29.000 --> 34:30.000]  Please listen to me.
[34:30.000 --> 34:31.000]  It's something terrible.
[34:31.000 --> 34:32.000]  Please.
[34:32.000 --> 34:33.000]  Your next, here they are.
[34:33.000 --> 34:34.000]  They're already here.
[34:34.000 --> 34:35.000]  Help.
[34:35.000 --> 34:36.000]  Your next.
[34:36.000 --> 34:37.000]  They're coming.
[34:37.000 --> 34:38.000]  They're coming.
[34:38.000 --> 34:39.000]  Sleep.
[34:39.000 --> 34:40.000]  The seed is planted.
[34:40.000 --> 34:41.000]  Sleep.
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  Sleep.
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  Terror grows in sleep.
[34:45.000 --> 34:46.000]  Elizabeth, wake up.
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  I'll get you when you sleep.
[34:48.000 --> 34:49.000]  Sit up.
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.000]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[34:55.000 --> 34:57.000]  Is it contagious?
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  It's a real homie.
[34:59.000 --> 35:00.000]  It looked right at me.
[35:00.000 --> 35:01.000]  You need to get out.
[35:01.000 --> 35:05.000]  If you're looking at it as if it was human, it was not human.
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.000]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  We're being cornered.
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  The barricaded street.
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.000]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[35:20.000 --> 35:21.000]  Oh, please.
[35:21.000 --> 35:22.000]  Don't go walking.
[35:22.000 --> 35:23.000]  Darren.
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.000]  Darren.
[35:24.000 --> 35:25.000]  Darren.
[35:25.000 --> 35:26.000]  Darren.
[35:26.000 --> 35:27.000]  Darren.
[35:27.000 --> 35:28.000]  Darren.
[35:28.000 --> 35:29.000]  Darren.
[35:29.000 --> 35:30.000]  Darren.
[35:30.000 --> 35:31.000]  Darren.
[35:31.000 --> 35:32.000]  Darren.
[35:32.000 --> 35:33.000]  Darren.
[35:33.000 --> 35:34.000]  Darren.
[35:34.000 --> 35:35.000]  Darren.
[35:35.000 --> 35:36.000]  Darren.
[35:36.000 --> 35:37.000]  Darren.
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  Darren.
[35:39.000 --> 35:40.000]  Who?
[35:40.000 --> 35:41.000]  Who?
[35:41.000 --> 35:42.000]  Who?
[35:42.000 --> 35:43.000]  Who?
[35:43.000 --> 35:44.000]  Who?
[35:44.000 --> 35:45.000]  Who?
[35:45.000 --> 35:46.000]  Who?
[35:46.000 --> 35:47.000]  Who?
[35:47.000 --> 35:48.000]  Who?
[35:48.000 --> 35:49.000]  Who?
[35:49.000 --> 35:50.000]  Who?
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.000]  Who?
[35:51.000 --> 35:52.000]  Who?
[35:52.000 --> 35:53.000]  Who?
[35:53.000 --> 35:54.000]  Who?
[35:54.000 --> 35:55.000]  Who?
[35:55.000 --> 35:56.000]  Who?
[35:56.000 --> 35:57.000]  Who?
[35:57.000 --> 35:58.000]  Who?
[35:58.000 --> 35:59.000]  Who?
[35:59.000 --> 36:00.000]  Who?
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.000]  Who?
[36:01.000 --> 36:02.000]  Who?
[36:02.000 --> 36:03.000]  Who?
[36:03.000 --> 36:04.000]  Who?
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.000]  Who?
[36:05.000 --> 36:06.000]  Who?
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.200]  What they have planned for our little ones?
[36:10.200 --> 36:15.080]  I wish to raise a matter of this afternoon for the attention of the Minister for Education
[36:15.080 --> 36:18.680]  and I have to say it is not often in this job I am absolutely shocked.
[36:18.680 --> 36:26.800]  I thought I'd seen everything, but this one is just beyond words.
[36:26.800 --> 36:32.520]  It is a note from a constituent who says, Hi Bernie, this is a worksheet that my 10-year-old
[36:32.520 --> 36:36.360]  daughter brought home from school and it includes a photo of the worksheet.
[36:36.360 --> 36:44.720]  Part of her homework was to discuss with her father his erections and ejaculation.
[36:44.720 --> 36:50.120]  I find this very disturbing and sickening, as indeed do I I have to say.
[36:50.120 --> 36:55.560]  What the hell is going on in this state when 10-year-old girls are told to go home and
[36:55.560 --> 36:59.520]  talk to your father about his erections and about his ejaculations?
[36:59.520 --> 37:01.400]  What the hell is going on here?
[37:01.400 --> 37:04.080]  I am very delighted that the Family Sex Show will be on in May.
[37:04.080 --> 37:08.320]  I am going to hand over to Josie, the artistic director of this show to say a little more.
[37:08.320 --> 37:12.720]  I run this egg and I have been making and producing the Family Sex Show along with
[37:12.720 --> 37:14.680]  lots of other people over the last few years.
[37:14.680 --> 37:20.320]  The Family Sex Show is a fun and playful show for adults and children aged 5 and up.
[37:20.320 --> 37:27.200]  It offers an honest human sex education that is feminist, queer, non-binary, inclusive
[37:27.200 --> 37:28.200]  and sex positive.
[37:28.200 --> 37:33.760]  This show can allow audiences of all ages to feel confident about their bodies, their
[37:33.760 --> 37:38.400]  boundaries and their sexual health and we really hope to see you here.
[37:38.400 --> 37:41.080]  So those of us that stand up for the little ones, they're going to be attacked, we're
[37:41.080 --> 37:44.680]  going to be demonized, we're going to be shot, we're going to be killed, we're going to
[37:44.680 --> 37:47.160]  be imprisoned, we're going to be tortured, we're going to be...
[37:47.160 --> 37:50.840]  A lot of things are going to happen to a lot of us but at the end of the day, ladies and
[37:50.840 --> 37:57.520]  gentlemen, God is watching and God is in control and those ebbledoers carrying these wicked
[37:57.520 --> 37:58.520]  deeds out.
[37:58.520 --> 38:05.520]  Will, hey, please he asked, he's 118 is for, in much wisdom is much grief and he that
[38:05.520 --> 38:08.000]  increases knowledge increases sorrow.
[38:08.000 --> 38:15.440]  I have much knowledge and I have much sorrow, much sorrow for the hundreds of millions
[38:15.440 --> 38:17.880]  of innocent people starving to death right now.
[38:17.880 --> 38:23.400]  We're looking at 260 million people and I'm not talking about hungry, I'm talking about
[38:23.400 --> 38:29.480]  marching towards starvation and that is a catastrophe in itself.
[38:29.480 --> 38:34.400]  Lockdowns around the world have led to labor shortages, supply chain disruption and a reduction
[38:34.400 --> 38:37.200]  in international trade.
[38:37.200 --> 38:45.040]  The result, less available food and less money to pay for it.
[38:45.040 --> 38:49.480]  It's a deadly combination and we've got to act now and we've got to be smart and we've
[38:49.480 --> 38:51.280]  got to thread the needle.
[38:51.280 --> 38:54.320]  We can't just deal with COVID by itself or hunger by itself.
[38:54.320 --> 38:57.240]  They must be dealt with together.
[38:57.240 --> 38:58.800]  If we do it right, we can save lives.
[38:58.800 --> 39:01.320]  If we don't do it right, people will die.
[39:01.320 --> 39:06.600]  We go to our football games and watch our sitcoms and then people that are living in
[39:06.600 --> 39:12.120]  pockets still of Western freedom, Western wealth, just go about their business playing
[39:12.120 --> 39:18.120]  golf and tennis and having fun and going to movies and as the water rises for those final
[39:18.120 --> 39:22.280]  islands of safety and security will finally be engulfed.
[39:22.280 --> 39:24.280]  But ignorance is blessed, right?
[39:24.280 --> 39:29.440]  But we are about to see the world we've known destroyed and on its ashes built a system
[39:29.440 --> 39:32.840]  designed to destroy the human that's made the image of God.
[39:32.840 --> 39:37.880]  It's a very painful thing to see the spirit of evil spreading its black wings over the
[39:37.880 --> 39:44.520]  earth and sinking its long stinking fangs in our children's very souls.
[39:44.520 --> 39:47.960]  That is the price of consciousness and free will for good is not the only thing in the
[39:47.960 --> 39:48.960]  universe.
[39:48.960 --> 39:55.000]  Evil dwells there as well and it is when those good spirits do not step in fight for innocence
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.760]  that innocence is destroyed and the blood of the children is on our hands.
[40:00.760 --> 40:07.560]  We're live, April 11, 2022, big news coming up.
[40:07.560 --> 40:11.360]  It's called the great reset, tough guy.
[40:11.360 --> 40:12.520]  It's called the new world order.
[40:12.520 --> 40:16.840]  It's called the big banks wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor so they can
[40:16.840 --> 40:21.680]  loan us fiat money to take control of our lives with a social credit score and the universal
[40:21.680 --> 40:22.680]  basic income.
[40:22.680 --> 40:23.680]  That's everything.
[40:23.680 --> 40:25.680]  That's the whole future of our lives.
[40:25.680 --> 40:30.760]  The whole world is going to be about surveillance and control and then manipulating and tracking
[40:30.760 --> 40:31.760]  everything you do.
[40:31.760 --> 40:32.760]  It's all being officially announced.
[40:32.760 --> 40:36.360]  We've got articles everywhere, they're press releases saying it.
[40:36.360 --> 40:42.760]  And the crew asked me during the break they go, are you all right, are you all right?
[40:42.760 --> 40:47.240]  Are you feeling okay?
[40:47.240 --> 40:51.040]  But then if I do the war, I mean they're going to starve a couple of hundred million people
[40:51.040 --> 40:52.040]  to death.
[40:52.040 --> 40:53.040]  Yeah, I'm pretty freaked out.
[40:53.040 --> 40:54.040]  Yeah, this is real.
[40:54.040 --> 40:56.040]  This is not a freaking game to me, man.
[40:56.040 --> 40:57.960]  You understand, like I love you.
[40:57.960 --> 40:58.960]  Right?
[40:58.960 --> 40:59.960]  I love you too.
[40:59.960 --> 41:00.960]  You know what I mean?
[41:00.960 --> 41:02.440]  People are starting to get like hundreds of millions right now.
[41:02.440 --> 41:03.440]  You ever see it on news?
[41:03.440 --> 41:04.440]  They're dying right now.
[41:04.440 --> 41:06.640]  They're in their freaking houses starting to get out of their beds.
[41:06.640 --> 41:10.120]  They're dying because they've been doing it all this time.
[41:10.120 --> 41:20.120]  You're freaking out, you're starting it up, begging for God to help them, and no one's coming because God tells us to get up and take action, and then we don't do anything!
[41:20.120 --> 41:23.120]  And that paralyzes God.
[41:24.120 --> 41:29.120]  Yeah, God can do it, but God needs us to do it, because God's not free will.
[41:30.120 --> 41:35.120]  Once again, for the first time, what has seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory turned out to be the truth.
[41:35.120 --> 41:41.120]  God, I'm upset, I'm really, I'm really freaked out.
[41:41.120 --> 41:51.120]  God, I'm really freaked out, I'm really freaked out, I'm really freaked out, you see, because this is real, the supply chain being cut off, the energy grid being cut off, it's real!
[41:54.120 --> 42:04.120]  And we're going into a time now where we're not going to be on the air, I mean if we don't back this off, if we don't get sane people to stop the globalists, I mean, we won't be here in six months.
[42:04.120 --> 42:08.120]  You won't be here in six months, you won't be here in six months.
[42:16.120 --> 42:19.120]  Who is the most banned news network in the world?
[42:19.120 --> 42:20.120]  Infowars.com
[42:20.120 --> 42:22.120]  Infowars comes to mind.
[42:22.120 --> 42:23.120]  Infowars.com
[42:23.120 --> 42:24.120]  Infowars
[42:24.120 --> 42:25.120]  You watch Infowars?
[42:25.120 --> 42:28.120]  Infowars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[42:28.120 --> 42:30.120]  Alex Jones, nice guy.
[42:30.120 --> 42:32.120]  You must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[42:32.120 --> 42:33.120]  Alex Jones
[42:33.120 --> 42:34.120]  Alex Jones
[42:34.120 --> 42:35.120]  Alex Jones
[42:35.120 --> 42:36.120]  Alex Jones
[42:36.120 --> 42:37.120]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[42:37.120 --> 42:41.120]  He knows who Infowars is, playing this joke over here, that's why the deep platform didn't work.
[42:41.120 --> 42:44.120]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[42:44.120 --> 42:47.120]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[42:51.120 --> 42:57.120]  We are back folks, stay with us, I got news so hardcore, I can't even spit it out, but I'm going to try and come back, stay with us.
[42:57.120 --> 43:02.120]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand Infowars.
[43:02.120 --> 43:07.120]  I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[43:07.120 --> 43:12.120]  I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[43:12.120 --> 43:17.120]  And it was a t-shirt I designed, the first one, Mass Murderers Agreed, Gun Control Works,
[43:17.120 --> 43:21.120]  that helped us finance hiring the first few members of my crew.
[43:21.120 --> 43:23.120]  That's our oldest design and we still sell it.
[43:23.120 --> 43:28.120]  We have that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions because
[43:28.120 --> 43:34.120]  whatever stock we've got in, that's it, we're selling everything out to fund the operation to get rid of inventory.
[43:34.120 --> 43:38.120]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future, they'll just be limited editions in short runs.
[43:38.120 --> 43:42.120]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[43:42.120 --> 43:47.120]  I almost forgot, we're selling them all at cost at infowarsstore.com.
[43:47.120 --> 43:54.120]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts,
[43:54.120 --> 44:18.120]  they're all selling at cost, infowarsstore.com.

[45:23.120 --> 45:27.120]  And they're a program after collapsing us of Build Back Better.
[45:27.120 --> 45:33.120]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[45:33.120 --> 45:36.120]  And because they couldn't take our guns, and because we wouldn't bow,
[45:36.120 --> 45:41.120]  because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win,
[45:41.120 --> 45:44.120]  they released a biological weapon on us.
[45:44.120 --> 45:48.120]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[45:48.120 --> 45:52.120]  It's that simple, they can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns.
[45:52.120 --> 45:56.120]  So the Global Corporate Combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[45:56.120 --> 45:59.120]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[45:59.120 --> 46:01.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[46:01.120 --> 46:04.120]  I need your help keeping infowars on the air and strong.
[46:04.120 --> 46:08.120]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[46:08.120 --> 46:10.120]  I was born for this. You were born for this.
[46:10.120 --> 46:15.120]  And people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our own infrastructure
[46:15.120 --> 46:19.120]  because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[46:19.120 --> 46:23.120]  And now, with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day,
[46:23.120 --> 46:27.120]  we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups
[46:27.120 --> 46:31.120]  to be able to post their content free of charge.
[46:31.120 --> 46:35.120]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[46:35.120 --> 46:39.120]  Infowars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership
[46:39.120 --> 46:42.120]  promoting the pro-human-liberty movement worldwide.
[46:42.120 --> 46:46.120]  The expenses in Band-Width alone are millions of dollars a quarter,
[46:46.120 --> 46:49.120]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[46:49.120 --> 46:52.120]  So the biggest sale in infowars history is going right now,
[46:52.120 --> 46:55.120]  the mega-emergency blowout sale up to 75% off,
[46:55.120 --> 47:18.120]  incredible products and keep infowars as strong as ever.
[47:18.120 --> 47:26.120]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen to this live April 11, Monday, 2022 transmission.
[47:26.120 --> 47:29.120]  Now, it'll be with us 30 minutes to the next hour.
[47:29.120 --> 47:33.120]  And I'm just going to try to give him the floor because I always liked Ali Alexander
[47:33.120 --> 47:35.120]  interviewing like five, six years ago.
[47:35.120 --> 47:38.120]  Then got to be friends with him during the last Trump campaign
[47:38.120 --> 47:40.120]  and then during the Stop the Steel.
[47:40.120 --> 47:45.120]  But he really is, with all the lawyers I know and all the really smart politicos,
[47:45.120 --> 47:48.120]  he's been the most right all along. I really respect him.
[47:48.120 --> 47:52.120]  I always liked him, but I really respect him now because he gives me insights
[47:52.120 --> 47:54.120]  that I didn't have that ended up being right.
[47:54.120 --> 47:58.120]  And that's what I really respect is people that are smarter than me in some aspects.
[47:58.120 --> 48:00.120]  We're all smarter than each other in certain ways.
[48:00.120 --> 48:04.120]  There's different types of IQs, but he's had the courage to go in
[48:04.120 --> 48:06.120]  in front of the congressional committees that are trying to set you up.
[48:06.120 --> 48:08.120]  I didn't even do it. I took the fifth.
[48:08.120 --> 48:13.120]  Not because I had anything to hide. I know they lie and are super sophisticated and smart.
[48:13.120 --> 48:16.120]  He did it and really had a huge victory.
[48:16.120 --> 48:18.120]  And now he's quote, cooperating.
[48:18.120 --> 48:21.120]  Well, they've subpoenaed him for grand jury. You have to cooperate.
[48:21.120 --> 48:23.120]  It doesn't mean he's like making stuff up.
[48:23.120 --> 48:28.120]  But the Whitmer case coming out, the not guilty and the mistrials,
[48:28.120 --> 48:33.120]  is the same FBI agents ran that operation that were running the capital operation.
[48:33.120 --> 48:39.120]  And the idea that they're trying to frame Ali Alexander and myself for this is a big, big deal.
[48:39.120 --> 48:43.120]  And I can't talk about just department things that are going on with me right now.
[48:43.120 --> 48:48.120]  They've asked us not to at this point, but it's very substantive.
[48:48.120 --> 48:54.120]  I mean, let's just say main prosecutors are involved.
[48:54.120 --> 49:00.120]  And so there's some things we can do, some things we can, but it's a very serious situation.
[49:00.120 --> 49:02.120]  So listers go, hey, we don't want to hear about January 6th.
[49:02.120 --> 49:05.120]  They tune out and talk about it because they know it wasn't preplanned.
[49:05.120 --> 49:07.120]  They know I weren't involved.
[49:07.120 --> 49:11.120]  They know the Democrats burned down billions of dollars and stuff and did all this.
[49:11.120 --> 49:16.120]  And then a thousand people went into the capital, only 200 or so attacked the cops.
[49:16.120 --> 49:18.120]  Okay, give them a jail sentence.
[49:18.120 --> 49:22.120]  But the fact that we're in martial law and civil war and all Republicans are evil
[49:22.120 --> 49:26.120]  and Mitch McConnell should be outlawed, even Joe Biden said a few months ago,
[49:26.120 --> 49:31.120]  the whole party's bad and we're going to have a, this is BS while Hunter Biden
[49:31.120 --> 49:33.120]  is laptop and the rest of it's out there.
[49:33.120 --> 49:37.120]  I'm going to shut up and give Ali Alexander the floor here, but this is a big deal
[49:37.120 --> 49:43.120]  because they're running on the midterms in 211 days on January 6th
[49:43.120 --> 49:51.120]  and they need to prove a fake connection from the protesters up into the Proud Boys
[49:51.120 --> 49:54.120]  and the Oath Keepers and into myself and Ali Alexander
[49:54.120 --> 50:00.120]  and then into the people that organized the Peaceful Rally up into the Trump administration and Trump
[50:00.120 --> 50:04.120]  and it's a fraud. So our listeners laugh because they know it's a fraud,
[50:04.120 --> 50:08.120]  but it's not a fraud because they are betting all their chips on this.
[50:08.120 --> 50:12.120]  Ali Alexander, sorry I got you on late, had a bunch of emergencies around here.
[50:12.120 --> 50:14.120]  Thank you so much.
[50:14.120 --> 50:16.120]  Hey, it's breaking news. I understand it.
[50:16.120 --> 50:18.120]  I mean, you're exactly right.
[50:18.120 --> 50:22.120]  And what our listeners need to understand is that essentially our activities,
[50:22.120 --> 50:29.120]  and I apologize for the bad wifi, but our activities are covered by the First Amendment.
[50:29.120 --> 50:36.120]  What the Democrats and the deep state are attempting to do is to take away those speech protections
[50:36.120 --> 50:41.120]  by saying we incited something or there was a grand conspiracy
[50:41.120 --> 50:46.120]  or the talking point now from the Democrats was that there was a self-coup.
[50:46.120 --> 50:51.120]  If they do this, what happens is that they will use you or me
[50:51.120 --> 50:56.120]  or some of our associates to say, well this was Trump's connection to the Proud Boys
[50:56.120 --> 50:59.120]  or this was Trump's connection to the Oathkeepers.
[50:59.120 --> 51:04.120]  So what listeners need to understand that in legal matters,
[51:04.120 --> 51:07.120]  when you're constructing a conspiracy case,
[51:07.120 --> 51:12.120]  they can't just hop from the violent elements to Trump, which is their real goal.
[51:12.120 --> 51:16.120]  What they need to do is that they need some in-between
[51:16.120 --> 51:19.120]  and they need to allege something happened that didn't happen.
[51:19.120 --> 51:23.120]  I didn't coordinate with the Proud Boys on January 6th
[51:23.120 --> 51:28.120]  and I'm also not presuming that any of them are guilty of frankly anything.
[51:28.120 --> 51:33.120]  We did allow the Oathkeepers to be ushers for my event,
[51:33.120 --> 51:37.120]  but I ran none of that by you, I ran none of that by your team,
[51:37.120 --> 51:42.120]  but this is what the Department of Justice and Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger
[51:42.120 --> 51:44.120]  and the rest of them are doing.
[51:44.120 --> 51:49.120]  So months ago I came on your air, Alex, and a lot of my friends were telling me,
[51:49.120 --> 51:53.120]  Ali, this is dying down, the public's not buying it. I said, I know,
[51:53.120 --> 51:56.120]  but they're putting all of their chips in this basket.
[51:56.120 --> 52:00.120]  I'll just be honest with you, I'm going to say this because I'm not CIA.
[52:00.120 --> 52:04.120]  The CIA is one of the biggest agencies in the U.S. but we have high-level sources.
[52:04.120 --> 52:08.120]  We were told four months ago, watch out, the Justice Department's coming,
[52:08.120 --> 52:11.120]  the next phase, we were told everything about the CIA.
[52:11.120 --> 52:14.120]  I'm just going to leave it at that because there's an internal civil war going on
[52:14.120 --> 52:17.120]  and that was our CIA contact. That doesn't mean the whole CIA is like this.
[52:17.120 --> 52:21.120]  I'm just getting it out there that the CIA said phase two is tying
[52:21.120 --> 52:25.120]  all the people that organized rallies to Trump and claiming that Trump
[52:25.120 --> 52:28.120]  and that the rally organizers were running the Proud Boys and that,
[52:28.120 --> 52:31.120]  which is preposterous. Please continue.
[52:31.120 --> 52:34.120]  No, you're right. And that's what the listeners need to understand, too,
[52:34.120 --> 52:39.120]  is that there is a civil war going on in the intelligence community.
[52:39.120 --> 52:45.120]  If listeners will remember, there was July or August of last year,
[52:45.120 --> 52:48.120]  there was a Reuters article that exonerated you,
[52:48.120 --> 52:51.120]  exonerated Raj from right in the headline.
[52:51.120 --> 52:54.120]  In the body, it also exonerated people like me.
[52:54.120 --> 52:58.120]  So I said rally organizers, speakers, blah, blah, blah.
[52:58.120 --> 53:02.120]  There's no investigation in these people. It's protected by the First Amendment.
[53:02.120 --> 53:07.120]  There's no connection between them and some of the violent elements of the riot.
[53:07.120 --> 53:13.120]  Or as you see, Ray Epps and other people who look like they did it in a premeditated way.
[53:13.120 --> 53:16.120]  They're not associated with any of those agitators.
[53:16.120 --> 53:22.120]  What was happening was that was the FBI so fed up with some of the political elements
[53:22.120 --> 53:25.120]  of the DOJ that they said, we got to get this evidence public.
[53:25.120 --> 53:27.120]  We got to get this evidence in the public.
[53:27.120 --> 53:32.120]  What happened is instead of the rest of the press kind of celebrating
[53:32.120 --> 53:37.120]  that we didn't organize some self-coup or insurrection or violent riot,
[53:37.120 --> 53:40.120]  the press tried to be mum on it.
[53:40.120 --> 53:44.120]  This was really, really dangerous. So what happened is those elements of the FBI
[53:44.120 --> 53:46.120]  largely got pushed out.
[53:46.120 --> 53:50.120]  And so when Merrick Garland on the anniversary of January 6th
[53:50.120 --> 53:53.120]  started trying to do a mea culpa with the January 6th committee
[53:53.120 --> 53:56.120]  and meeting them halfway said we're going to follow the money
[53:56.120 --> 53:58.120]  and we're going to restart new investigations,
[53:58.120 --> 54:03.120]  that was the beginning of our hellscape round two.
[54:03.120 --> 54:08.120]  And so unfortunately, the Department of Justice contacted my lawyers about a month ago.
[54:08.120 --> 54:10.120]  They said that we don't want...
[54:10.120 --> 54:13.120]  We're not going to ask all of you to voluntarily cooperate.
[54:13.120 --> 54:15.120]  We're going to subpoena him. You better come in.
[54:15.120 --> 54:17.120]  You better give us some information.
[54:17.120 --> 54:20.120]  I'd like to know what the rules of the road are and...
[54:20.120 --> 54:23.120]  By the way, Ollie, as you know, I'm not ready to get around.
[54:23.120 --> 54:26.120]  That's been going on. We're on parallel tracks here.
[54:26.120 --> 54:29.120]  What's happening to you has happened to me and I'm just...
[54:29.120 --> 54:32.120]  I don't know how to respond to at this point because it's so ridiculous.
[54:32.120 --> 54:33.120]  Please continue.
[54:33.120 --> 54:38.120]  And Alex, a lot of people are stuck in this position that I'm in, that you're in.
[54:38.120 --> 54:41.120]  You know, Trump allies and Trump detractors.
[54:41.120 --> 54:43.120]  I just happen to be the first one.
[54:43.120 --> 54:46.120]  I got to tell you, I feel like I'm the first one out of the gate
[54:46.120 --> 54:49.120]  and I'm going to get shot because what happens when you're like me
[54:49.120 --> 54:51.120]  and the Justice Department tells you,
[54:51.120 --> 54:54.120]  don't admit that this is happening and then you go and admit it.
[54:54.120 --> 54:57.120]  You're not violating any law, but they can charge you with a crime.
[54:57.120 --> 55:00.120]  Well, I want to talk about your courage because I've been advised not to talk about it.
[55:00.120 --> 55:03.120]  You were the first to go to the committee and the lion's den.
[55:03.120 --> 55:07.120]  You're the first to go and admit it's happening and they spit it like you're cooperating.
[55:07.120 --> 55:09.120]  No, you're standing up against the lie.
[55:09.120 --> 55:11.120]  You're a hero and I mean that.
[55:11.120 --> 55:14.120]  Well, I'm not afraid to talk to them.
[55:14.120 --> 55:18.120]  Just my memory's not perfect and they'll try to twist something.
[55:18.120 --> 55:20.120]  That's exactly it.
[55:20.120 --> 55:25.120]  It's like, why would they wait a year and a half to ask us logistical details?
[55:25.120 --> 55:27.120]  That's all the information that you and I have.
[55:27.120 --> 55:32.120]  I've handed over my text messages and they show minute by minute
[55:32.120 --> 55:37.120]  our real time shock and awe dismay and then de-escalation
[55:37.120 --> 55:42.120]  and then retreat from the area as not to act as magnets for the riots.
[55:42.120 --> 55:47.120]  I'm so grateful that one of the J6 defendants just recently got off
[55:47.120 --> 55:50.120]  because the judge said, no, he was waved in by a cop.
[55:50.120 --> 55:52.120]  The press is beating me up.
[55:52.120 --> 55:54.120]  Why won't you denounce these people?
[55:54.120 --> 55:56.120]  Why won't you denounce these people?
[55:56.120 --> 55:58.120]  The Justice Department is hanging it over my head.
[55:58.120 --> 56:01.120]  They want these one words.
[56:01.120 --> 56:04.120]  They want us to perform an act of Judas Alex.
[56:04.120 --> 56:09.120]  They want you or me to say that we predicted violence when we did it.
[56:09.120 --> 56:12.120]  Why? Because that's an element they need for a conspiracy case.
[56:12.120 --> 56:17.120]  They want you or I to say that we talked to the White House about militia groups.
[56:17.120 --> 56:19.120]  I didn't talk to the White House about militia groups.
[56:19.120 --> 56:21.120]  I don't think you talked to the White House about militia groups.
[56:21.120 --> 56:23.120]  This is all a setup.
[56:23.120 --> 56:26.120]  But guess what? Our text messages, our emails, our movements,
[56:26.120 --> 56:30.120]  and the videos of that day that we've made public, they exonerate us.
[56:30.120 --> 56:32.120]  There was no insurrection.
[56:32.120 --> 56:34.120]  I agree. Let's come back next time and talk about Big Picture,
[56:34.120 --> 56:38.120]  what happened with the Whitmer fake prosecution, false flag imploding, how big it is.
[56:38.120 --> 56:39.120]  I want to explain.
[56:39.120 --> 56:42.120]  For listeners, I know you get this, but this isn't about January 6th now.
[56:42.120 --> 56:44.120]  It's not about Ali Alexander or Alexander Trump.
[56:44.120 --> 56:47.120]  It's about their framing all Americans as terrorists
[56:47.120 --> 56:50.120]  and saying a revolution is about to happen in a civil war based on this,
[56:50.120 --> 56:53.120]  and we don't want violence and we're not about to stage something
[56:53.120 --> 56:55.120]  and we're not revolutionary violent leaders.
[56:55.120 --> 56:58.120]  We are thought leaders and that's why this is so important
[56:58.120 --> 57:02.120]  because even though we've all moved past it and we're sick of it, believe me, I'm sick of it,
[57:02.120 --> 57:04.120]  I know Lizard is sick of it.
[57:04.120 --> 57:08.120]  The Democrats are betting everything on this number on the roulette wheel,
[57:08.120 --> 57:11.120]  which means they're going to pull false flags or something big.
[57:11.120 --> 57:15.120]  Ali Alexander, you're one of the most banned people in the world for standing up for freedom.
[57:15.120 --> 57:18.120]  Where's the best place for people to find all the great work you do?
[57:18.120 --> 57:21.120]  On Telegram, Ali Alexander.
[57:21.120 --> 57:24.120]  I'm also on Truth Social as Ali.
[57:24.120 --> 57:26.120]  All right, stay there.
[57:26.120 --> 57:29.120]  I'm going to come back in two minutes and I'm going to try to just, we'll get into Whitmer.
[57:29.120 --> 57:31.120]  We'll get into the false flags.
[57:31.120 --> 57:33.120]  We'll get into where this is going straight ahead.

[59:44.120 --> 59:47.120]  Take action now, infowarsstore.com.
[59:47.120 --> 59:57.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:17.120 --> 1:00:37.120]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[1:00:37.120 --> 1:00:48.120]  Thomas Jefferson, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:48.120 --> 1:00:50.120]  All right, the next two segments, I'm going to shut up.
[1:00:50.120 --> 1:00:52.120]  You have Ali Alexander on the floor.
[1:00:52.120 --> 1:00:53.120]  Any comments?
[1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:57.120]  No convictions for FBI directed white supremacist Whitmer kidnapping suspects acquitted.
[1:00:57.120 --> 1:01:00.120]  Grand jury deadlocked in political prosecution.
[1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:05.120]  It's called another famous, the most famous FBI provocateur operation ever.
[1:01:05.120 --> 1:01:07.120]  We should probably hit that now.
[1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:08.120]  But Ali, you've got the floor.
[1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:10.120]  I'm going to just shut up this segment in the next.
[1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:13.120]  So don't pause because I'm going to let you talk about just all of this.
[1:01:13.120 --> 1:01:18.120]  Because I'm telling you, when I talk to you on the phone, I just sit there and listen because it's so on target.
[1:01:18.120 --> 1:01:22.120]  No, no, I mean, Alex, like, you know, I couldn't do this.
[1:01:22.120 --> 1:01:30.120]  But look, I mean, what we know about the FBI case in Michigan is that they moved the guy who was in charge
[1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:37.120]  and really set up that plot to cover for her killing all those elderly people in nursing homes.
[1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:41.120]  So they created this to try to give her a more national profile.
[1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:45.120]  They created this stupid two in Michigan.
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:49.120]  And then they moved that guy over to Washington to oversee the January 6 cases.
[1:01:49.120 --> 1:01:56.120]  So what we've learned is that J. Edgar Hoover's FBI is worse than when it was during Hoover.
[1:01:56.120 --> 1:02:01.120]  And because of 9-11, the laws are so flimsy that the FBI can set up anything,
[1:02:01.120 --> 1:02:04.120]  can allege anything, and then it becomes true.
[1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:11.120]  And then what's worse, what's worse is that the people have become suspicious of each other because we've been programmed.
[1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:17.120]  So you or I could not get a fair trial in New York City or Washington, D.C.
[1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:22.120]  But liberals could get a fair trial in Texas or in Florida.
[1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:25.120]  And so we really live in this two tiered system.
[1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:32.120]  So when people like you or me or Roger Stone or Steve Pannon are going through some of these legal quandaries,
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:35.120]  people are like, well, why are they doing that? Well, why are they doing that?
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:39.120]  Not understanding that we know we didn't commit a crime.
[1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:42.120]  We know that they can fabricate a charge.
[1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:47.120]  And then usually a fabricated charge can't survive a conviction.
[1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:51.120]  Thank God in this FBI case in Michigan, it didn't.
[1:02:51.120 --> 1:02:58.120]  But when we're looking in Washington, D.C., we can absolutely be convicted by a D.C. judge
[1:02:58.120 --> 1:03:01.120]  who wants a special appointment from the Biden administration,
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:07.120]  or a D.C. jury that has been told that we try to hurt their children and hurt their spouses.
[1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:11.120]  I mean, we're really living at the end of the Republic.
[1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:16.120]  And what we got to do as patriots is be safe, be smart, stay in prayer,
[1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:19.120]  and be very mindful about what we say and what we mean
[1:03:19.120 --> 1:03:22.120]  You know, I want to affirm 1776.
[1:03:22.120 --> 1:03:24.120]  I want to affirm the Second Amendment.
[1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:28.120]  And yet the DOJ wants to weaponize terms like that,
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:32.120]  and they want to weaponize messages like that and say, OK, well, now you're going to jail,
[1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:36.120]  or now you're part of a federal criminal conspiracy because of one of your supporters,
[1:03:36.120 --> 1:03:37.120]  the X, Y, or Z.
[1:03:37.120 --> 1:03:43.120]  And so we live in a preposterous time, but folks need to realize we're on a three-part track
[1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:46.120]  to stop Trump from running in 2024.
[1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:51.120]  There's the J6 Commission Committee, there's the DOJ investigation,
[1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:53.120]  and then there's the civil cases.
[1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:59.120]  You just saw Judge Carter wrote this ridiculous opinion where he said that Donald Trump
[1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:05.120]  was likely in charge of a criminal conspiracy to overthrow the government.
[1:04:05.120 --> 1:04:07.120]  He threw the J6 Committee a bone.
[1:04:07.120 --> 1:04:10.120]  The J6 Committee then throws the DOJ a bone and says,
[1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:13.120]  if you don't charge him, then we'll criminally refer him.
[1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:16.120]  So, you know, we just live in a preposterous time.
[1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:20.120]  They're running the last part of their coup because they don't want more elections.
[1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:22.120]  They don't want a Republican Party.
[1:04:22.120 --> 1:04:23.120]  They don't want Christians.
[1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:28.120]  They want to implode us, and they want to usher us in to a stateless new world order.
[1:04:28.120 --> 1:04:31.120]  You said it absolutely perfectly, and they even admit that.
[1:04:31.120 --> 1:04:33.120]  We're going to come back in one minute.
[1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:35.120]  I want you to continue for two segments.
[1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:39.120]  Ali Alexander, who's been totally vindicated and the only guy that's had the courage
[1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:44.120]  to testify to the feds and to the J6 Committee,
[1:04:44.120 --> 1:04:48.120]  and they're just totally upset and don't know what to do because we did nothing.
[1:04:48.120 --> 1:04:49.120]  We were there.
[1:04:49.120 --> 1:05:18.120]  And it was the federal stand down of police and military that allowed this to happen.
[1:05:18.120 --> 1:05:38.120]  All.
[1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:41.360]  got them all and we've got to liquidate them all and they're limited edition
[1:05:41.360 --> 1:05:46.520]  because we're never gonna make any of these designs again we are going to come
[1:05:46.520 --> 1:05:50.240]  out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in the future
[1:05:50.240 --> 1:05:54.280]  we've got to sell this to keep m4s on the air plus it spreads the word info
[1:05:54.280 --> 1:06:07.760]  store.com here historic apparel now info store.com the answer to 1984 is 1776 live
[1:06:07.760 --> 1:06:17.040]  from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones well Ali Alexander is a
[1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:24.600]  Republican political analysis expert analyst campaign manager you name it and
[1:06:24.600 --> 1:06:28.680]  he helped run stop the steel standing up and challenging election results now
[1:06:28.680 --> 1:06:31.160]  whether he was right or wrong and he was certainly right and we've seen the
[1:06:31.160 --> 1:06:36.280]  evidence that's his right as an American to do that. There's a clip I've got here
[1:06:36.280 --> 1:06:39.760]  in the stack I forget where it's that guy's telling where it is because there's
[1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:42.720]  like 50 clips there I forget which number it is where Hillary's like
[1:06:42.720 --> 1:06:47.360]  Democrats are having elections stolen from them by Republicans with electronic
[1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:54.560]  machines but she can say that but simultaneously but simultaneously if
[1:06:54.560 --> 1:07:03.160]  Trump says that or you say that or I say that that here's a clip well then if we
[1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:08.360]  say that then we are the bad people ladies and gentlemen so they're allowed
[1:07:08.360 --> 1:07:12.880]  to say it but we're not allowed to say it here it is here's the crime Ali
[1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:22.120]  Alexander Alex Jones Donald Trump Rudolph Giuliani Trump Jr. all everybody's bad
[1:07:22.120 --> 1:07:28.320]  because we're doing what she does here it is. You can run the best campaign you
[1:07:28.320 --> 1:07:35.200]  can even become the nominee and you can have the election stolen from you.
[1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:43.440]  Ali Alexander take it over with the Whitmer false flag plot Michigan exposed
[1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:48.240]  and the not guilty and hung jury with all this this is just insane to be
[1:07:48.240 --> 1:07:53.760]  watching please continue. Yeah I think I really do think this is the end of the
[1:07:53.760 --> 1:07:59.880]  Republic and I think you know CNN did a segment on me this weekend and they
[1:07:59.880 --> 1:08:04.320]  actually kind of soberly laid out the case that I wasn't cooperating with the
[1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:08.680]  feds they said don't get your hopes up they said this is an eccentric character
[1:08:08.680 --> 1:08:13.160]  he says wild things on info wars and then they said you know he would never be a
[1:08:13.160 --> 1:08:17.320]  witness against Trump so what the feds are obviously doing because they
[1:08:17.320 --> 1:08:20.880]  subpoenaed him and he's not and he didn't come in voluntary is that they
[1:08:20.880 --> 1:08:25.520]  are probing him for information that may lead to you know other people blah
[1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:29.760]  blah blah and I thought wow there's my enemies at least kind of very soberly
[1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:34.800]  trying to let down their audience's excitement but but in all of that I I
[1:08:34.800 --> 1:08:38.120]  really feel like this is the end of the Republican I shouldn't say that I
[1:08:38.120 --> 1:08:43.440]  should be excited about the red wave but Alex it wasn't conservative media that
[1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:48.800]  solved the Whitmore case it was Buzzfeed news I mean let me say that again
[1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:54.720]  Buzzfeed news is the news organization it's not even a news organization that
[1:08:54.720 --> 1:09:02.080]  exonerated the and exposed the FBI plot in that state kidnapping case without
[1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:06.320]  Buzzfeed news there would be injustice and those guys would have gone to jail
[1:09:06.320 --> 1:09:12.320]  and so where the hell is conservative media where are the protests you know
[1:09:12.320 --> 1:09:17.720]  the RNC raised two hundred and fifty million dollars off the movement that
[1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:23.160]  was coined by Roger Stone ran by me and fueled by you they raised two hundred and
[1:09:23.160 --> 1:09:27.760]  fifty million dollars no one's paying for my lawyers no one's paying for your
[1:09:27.760 --> 1:09:33.200]  lawyers you know all of that money went to go buy bagels for Ronald Romney
[1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:38.280]  McDaniel with Cheney just announced that she raised two point nine million
[1:09:38.280 --> 1:09:42.880]  dollars in a quarter hey she's gone from raising a couple hundred thousand
[1:09:42.880 --> 1:09:48.920]  dollars to two point nine million dollars in a state that does not have a
[1:09:48.920 --> 1:09:53.960]  million people and she's gonna get Democrats to vote for her in the
[1:09:53.960 --> 1:09:58.840]  primary so that she runs it to and stays there she has said that it is her
[1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:04.240]  number one priority to make sure that Donald Trump does not re-enter the
[1:10:04.240 --> 1:10:12.440]  White House by any means necessary I mean Alex we're at the end of the
[1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:18.360]  Republic and we need a miracle I think is what I'm saying that there's hope in
[1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:22.400]  Jesus Christ but there's not hope in the Republican Party there's not hope in
[1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:26.840]  the conservative movement nobody's doing any organizing all of us who are deep
[1:10:26.840 --> 1:10:32.600]  platform and then you know Alex I know that you were really really hard you know
[1:10:32.600 --> 1:10:37.600]  at your job and media but then the rest of your day is spent with lawyers you
[1:10:37.600 --> 1:10:42.000]  know and they mean to break us down they mean to demoralize us because they
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:45.920]  want us to bear false testimony there wasn't an insurrection on January 6th
[1:10:45.920 --> 1:10:50.360]  I'm sorry Trump didn't direct us to start a violent
[1:10:50.360 --> 1:10:53.600]  militia we weren't coordinating with violent militias and I frankly I don't
[1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:56.560]  even think that there are militias there you know there are people larping and
[1:10:56.560 --> 1:11:02.360]  stuff like that but anyway you know I'm I'm kind of frustrated and rambling but
[1:11:02.360 --> 1:11:08.120]  but but dude this all seems to serve the great reset I think that if you take
[1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:14.760]  down America the world questions whether or not there can be nation-states so I
[1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:18.480]  think this is all part of their plan we're watching in real time we find
[1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:22.800]  ourselves as characters in this dystopian novel and it's really freaky
[1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:26.560]  that there are our neighbors even if they're Democrats that are willing to
[1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:31.520]  cooperate with this insanity they look at our text messages in the videos of us
[1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:36.000]  pulling people away from the Capitol steps or you know they look at the text
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:41.800]  messages of the would be FBI kidnappers and these guys are just talking about
[1:11:41.800 --> 1:11:47.640]  beers and women and and shooting and they we are not the monsters that they
[1:11:47.640 --> 1:11:52.200]  think we are you know the right wing has never been the monsters that they think
[1:11:52.200 --> 1:11:56.120]  we are they're the eugenicists they're the murderers they're the baby killers
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:12:00.280]  they're the pedophiles they are the people who send people to war and yet
[1:12:00.280 --> 1:12:04.120]  every generation through the hegemon dialectic they just change it and
[1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:09.080]  relabel it as us right wings fascists they're the fascists so you know it's
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:14.000]  it's extremely frustrating but I thank God you know you lend your platform to
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:18.140]  me that I can be able to talk because what they do is they size me then they
[1:12:18.140 --> 1:12:23.360]  make up a lie about me and I can't respond I'm not allowed on Twitter I'm not
[1:12:23.360 --> 1:12:27.440]  allowed to talk to media conservative media doesn't care what it is really the
[1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:32.400]  big issue isn't it that they demonize us they lie about us we can't respond so it
[1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:37.000]  just makes them more insane what do you think of Elon Musk buying 9.2% and now
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.920]  saying he wants to turn Twitter headquarters in San Francisco into a
[1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:44.800]  homeless shelter and challenging them because I think it's overdue to challenge
[1:12:44.800 --> 1:12:49.280]  the censorship America and the world is rejecting it we have the mouse
[1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:56.640]  conquering the lion here you know a lot of a lot of my supporters say well
[1:12:56.640 --> 1:13:01.000]  trust Elon Musk or not and I'm like that's not the standard of reason that we
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:04.320]  were getting especially you know Jesus said you'll know the mother so you
[1:13:04.320 --> 1:13:08.800]  look what you don't do is you don't your trust for your faith in any man you
[1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:14.280]  just know by your teeth as a temporary alliances are perfectly fine and never
[1:13:14.280 --> 1:13:18.280]  stop your opponents when they're fighting you know this is essentially um
[1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:26.480]  this was a and the United States fighting because they were scared that they were
[1:13:26.480 --> 1:13:31.120]  going to get your crap okay what we need to do is you on
[1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:37.960]  your skype was was bad before now it's unintelligible but you're saying
[1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:42.200]  incredibly important things stay there let's reconnect with Ali Alexander we're
[1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:44.640]  going to come back to him for one more segment to talk about the Whitmer plot
[1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:52.080]  and so much more as the wheels come off the globalist just departments move to
[1:13:52.080 --> 1:13:56.760]  label and demonize all Americans that are in opposition to the takeover our
[1:13:56.760 --> 1:14:01.160]  country as terrorists but I didn't plug last hour let me plug this hour and I'm
[1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:03.440]  just going to be pointing like with listeners we're not bringing in the

[1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:09.320]  radio show I wanted to hire camera people to make films I wanted to really
[1:16:09.320 --> 1:16:13.400]  challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt I designed the first one mass
[1:16:13.400 --> 1:16:18.080]  murderers agreed gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first

[1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:04.320]  I say it it's just true that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard
[1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:10.640]  of human liberty as the logo of human populist resistance against their
[1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:17.440]  transhumanist anti-human program and man our work is really right now hitting
[1:17:17.440 --> 1:17:23.000]  the most important aspects of what we've ever done so I'm asking listeners now to

[1:18:09.520 --> 1:18:14.680]  exploding the supply chains have broken down and info wars is having serious
[1:18:14.680 --> 1:18:18.960]  trouble making its payroll and paying for operations and I do not want to
[1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:22.840]  implode or downsize in the face of the globalist making their main move.
[1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:26.880]  Info wars its paradoxical is more popular than ever it is reaching more
[1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:31.400]  people than ever despite the censorship but because of cost increasing and having
[1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:34.520]  to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth everything else we

[1:19:01.160 --> 1:19:08.080]  at 1776coin.com or infowarstore.com and the second installment is the Tree of
[1:19:08.080 --> 1:19:11.560]  Liberty Thomas Jefferson quote must be watered with the blood of Patriots and
[1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:15.960]  Tyrants it's a coin I designed I'm very proud of it and it will end up being a
[1:19:15.960 --> 1:19:20.360]  collectible I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other
[1:19:20.360 --> 1:19:26.080]  places for three times what we sold it we need to sell all 10,000 of these very
[1:19:26.080 --> 1:19:30.760]  very quickly and I appreciate listeners getting over half of them now I'd like
[1:19:30.760 --> 1:19:34.440]  to move them out very quickly I think they will sell out probably in five or
[1:19:34.440 --> 1:19:40.120]  six more days and without the last coin sale we would not be operating at the
[1:19:40.120 --> 1:19:43.160]  same capacity we've had to lay off a lot of people and that's a big problem so as
[1:19:43.160 --> 1:19:46.400]  a limited edition collectible tied to our political movement of liberty and
[1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:49.400]  freedom and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems
[1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:55.560]  so please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the new order at 1776
[1:19:55.560 --> 1:20:03.280]  coin.com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex
[1:20:03.280 --> 1:20:05.760]  Jones
[1:20:05.760 --> 1:20:22.320]  imagine a million people gathered together the nation's capital on January
[1:20:22.320 --> 1:20:31.840]  6th 2021 to protest an election has been done many times in American history and
[1:20:31.840 --> 1:20:36.040]  a few hundred attack police the police stand down and wave in a thousand or so
[1:20:36.040 --> 1:20:41.400]  and then we're told it's the greatest attack on America bigger than 9-11 and
[1:20:41.400 --> 1:20:47.960]  as important as Pearl Harbor what an insult to people that died on 9-11 and
[1:20:47.960 --> 1:20:53.360]  at Pearl Harbor under real attack unbelievable and we're not happy about
[1:20:53.360 --> 1:20:57.200]  what happened for the police officer that died later and the five patriots that
[1:20:57.200 --> 1:21:01.600]  died or Ashley Babbit but to have them then try to frame this is the biggest
[1:21:01.600 --> 1:21:04.720]  event in world history and then demonize those of us that were just
[1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:11.800]  peacefully promoting rallies for years and months before for Trump and
[1:21:11.800 --> 1:21:20.320]  protesting to say that we are prime suspects in this wanted bigger than 9-11
[1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:24.440]  attack is just a spectacular fraud and it tells you how crazy the Democrats are
[1:21:24.440 --> 1:21:29.440]  that they're betting everything they've got on this Ali Alexander you got the
[1:21:29.440 --> 1:21:34.920]  floor police continue and the tie into the Whitmer situation and the FBI caught
[1:21:34.920 --> 1:21:40.480]  the false flag that's so huge yeah I apologize for the for the the cruddy
[1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:47.320]  Wi-Fi but you know Alex what I was saying was to me we're looking at the end of
[1:21:47.320 --> 1:21:50.960]  the Republic or at least the acknowledgement that we are a fake
[1:21:50.960 --> 1:21:55.480]  Republic that this is all an illusion and why is that because they can't have
[1:21:55.480 --> 1:22:00.400]  America be the superpower if they want a one-world government they just cannot
[1:22:00.400 --> 1:22:04.060]  have that and so what they need is another crisis I think that that's why
[1:22:04.060 --> 1:22:09.240]  we're watching this internal civil war happen within the deep state and with
[1:22:09.240 --> 1:22:13.000]  the and within the New World Order where they are choosing is it going to be
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:17.520]  pestilence again is it going to be famine or is it going to be war or are
[1:22:17.520 --> 1:22:20.880]  they going to give us a trifecta and we're going to get all three but what
[1:22:20.880 --> 1:22:24.920]  they really really want to do is that they really really want to disassemble
[1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:30.200]  the world recongeal it and and I think what they need to do is they need to
[1:22:30.200 --> 1:22:35.880]  paint the right wing the Patriots the believers as disbelievers as violent as
[1:22:35.880 --> 1:22:40.480]  haters of their country why because they need to invert it these people are
[1:22:40.480 --> 1:22:45.000]  alchemists you know they're obsessed with this kind of like chemical formula of
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:49.960]  of of you know manipulating the masses and so what we're looking at the when
[1:22:49.960 --> 1:22:54.080]  we're looking at the Michigan you know fake kidnapping I don't even know what
[1:22:54.080 --> 1:22:57.680]  to call it the FBI kidnapping plot what you see is again they're trying to
[1:22:57.680 --> 1:23:03.520]  invert good Michiganders some of them autists and say that well they were
[1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:08.000]  they are super sleuths that they're super brains that were plotting to take
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:12.040]  out this governor who by the way the deep state wants to make a national figure
[1:23:12.040 --> 1:23:17.240]  they know Joe Biden and Kamala Harris can't be elected so they're priming
[1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:21.840]  Whitmore they're priming Newsom they're priming all these other figures to run
[1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:25.520]  in their stead because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are gonna be given to the
[1:23:25.520 --> 1:23:30.160]  mob you know this is part of their plan they do this all the time and so I just
[1:23:30.160 --> 1:23:35.120]  you know I really fear for our country and my only hope is literally in a
[1:23:35.120 --> 1:23:41.160]  miracle my only hope is in a miracle my hope is that is that people tune out
[1:23:41.160 --> 1:23:46.640]  Twitter that they tune out the New York Times that they tune out press releases
[1:23:46.640 --> 1:23:52.160]  by the DOJ saying this person admitted this or this person's cooperating because
[1:23:52.160 --> 1:23:57.000]  it's all BS what they want is that they want a military servicemen to hate the
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:03.120]  country they want believers to give up hope in God and that's how they invert
[1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:07.400]  the country and so what we've got to do is we've just got to you know stay
[1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:12.040]  primed with true information hunt down the criminal conspiracies not believe
[1:24:12.040 --> 1:24:16.360]  the baseless conspiracies and you know we've got to be on the lookout for these
[1:24:16.360 --> 1:24:22.000]  plots that they want to trap us in and you know J6 was what they want and you
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:26.480]  know I think it's gonna get a lot worse the Michigan case was a prelude to J6
[1:24:26.480 --> 1:24:31.720]  but I think J6 is a prelude to whatever false flag they're planning to hit
[1:24:31.720 --> 1:24:35.960]  Washington DC you know either around the midterms or shortly thereafter I
[1:24:35.960 --> 1:24:39.520]  totally agree that you can see all the pre-programming and the final piece
[1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:42.520]  it's like one of jigsaw puzzles already put together it's like three pieces left
[1:24:42.520 --> 1:24:46.080]  you already know what they are the next move is false flag which they believe
[1:24:46.080 --> 1:24:49.880]  will trigger a civil war which is a smoke stream for the Democrat deep state
[1:24:49.880 --> 1:24:55.160]  and then Ryan knows their ally within the neocons to outlaw political dissent
[1:24:55.160 --> 1:24:59.360]  create a one-party state like Venezuela with a ceremonial opposition party and
[1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:03.080]  and basically come after their their their detractors I mean they've lost
[1:25:03.080 --> 1:25:07.360]  they've already been put down America's already woken up it's like
[1:25:07.360 --> 1:25:09.960]  Terminator we've already beaten the machines so we've got to send a
[1:25:09.960 --> 1:25:15.960]  Terminator back in time to defeat us we already won yeah I think that's I think
[1:25:15.960 --> 1:25:21.800]  that's about right so I don't know how do you think that we get at it you know
[1:25:21.800 --> 1:25:26.760]  we've seen so many big globalist operations like the poison shots and and
[1:25:26.760 --> 1:25:30.840]  this Whitmer thing and they're just countless examples of what they wanted
[1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:34.520]  to happen isn't happening in government and corporations so I think there's a
[1:25:34.520 --> 1:25:38.280]  lot of good people inside the system of every race color creed and sexual
[1:25:38.280 --> 1:25:42.320]  preference that just don't like what's happening and get it they're not willing
[1:25:42.320 --> 1:25:45.200]  to go public but behind the scenes they're leaking information they're
[1:25:45.200 --> 1:25:51.040]  sabotaging corruption and I have a lot of faith in humanity right now Ali yeah
[1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:54.440]  I think that's right I was talking with our friend Pete's hand till he one time
[1:25:54.440 --> 1:25:59.280]  on his show and he said and he told me in a private call he said what you're
[1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:04.280]  going to need are whistleblowers we will never beat them without whistleblowers
[1:26:04.280 --> 1:26:08.720]  and by the grace of God you know there's been a trickle you know let's not
[1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:15.280]  forget that in this this J6 case where someone was totally acquitted it took a
[1:26:15.280 --> 1:26:20.080]  government witness saying yeah the cops did wave them in you know why hasn't
[1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:24.280]  taken this many cases right and you know what they were doing right they were
[1:26:24.280 --> 1:26:29.000]  doing all these plea deals all these plea deals so that everyone would feel the
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:34.640]  pressure to lie to take on prison sentences that they didn't need and this
[1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:39.560]  is all again to build a conspiracy a criminal conspiracy case that will take
[1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:44.560]  Trump off the ballot in strategic states like North Carolina and other places
[1:26:44.560 --> 1:26:50.160]  where you know I totally let's talk about MTG Democrats accused Republicans
[1:26:50.160 --> 1:26:53.560]  of trying to steal elections by challenging them they're saying because
[1:26:53.560 --> 1:26:57.320]  you challenge an election well you're right you're not allowed to run there
[1:26:57.320 --> 1:27:00.880]  they have Democratic operatives and I saw the judge that it can go forward in
[1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:06.080]  Georgia to try to not let MTG who wanted a landslide run again that's blocking
[1:27:06.080 --> 1:27:11.040]  votes by not letting people have the candidate they want. Bingo so Mark
[1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:16.360]  Elias he's a famous Democrat lawyer he tried this against Madison Cawthorn in
[1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:20.320]  North Carolina because North Carolina structure is really crazy by the grace of
[1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:24.480]  God a judge said no I'm not going to listen to the board of elections so that
[1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:28.560]  shouldn't have happened so we got an easy win there in Georgia they're using
[1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:33.360]  the same 14th Amendment claim against Marjorie Taylor Greene you know one of
[1:27:33.360 --> 1:27:38.320]  the best members of Congress and that's unfortunate and in Arizona they have the
[1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:43.440]  Biden electors suing under the 14th Amendment Paul Gosar Annie Biggs and
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:47.560]  others and Mark Fincham saying that they shouldn't be able to stand for office
[1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:53.200]  you're seeing a prototype happen for 2023 they're gonna use they just need one
[1:27:53.200 --> 1:27:58.440]  victory in one state so that they can do that against Trump because a lot of
[1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:02.720]  people don't realize there's no federal ballot there are 50 different ballots
[1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:07.760]  that Trump has to qualify for and all we need is one rogue state where we need
[1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:11.840]  the elect or where we need its electoral votes and then Trump says well I can
[1:28:11.840 --> 1:28:15.880]  run in 48 states and that's why they put Manafort in prison because they were so
[1:28:15.880 --> 1:28:20.800]  mad that he qualified Trump last time exactly exactly take out the strategist
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:24.360]  take out the organizer take out the line of communications and you can never
[1:28:24.360 --> 1:28:28.520]  happen opposition but let me end it with this you know they absolutely want to
[1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:33.240]  take out Trump by imploding MAGA they want hold on if you gotta go we gotta
[1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:36.200]  go but to do five more months on the side Ali I want to talk about how they
[1:28:36.200 --> 1:28:39.880]  implode MAGA how we stopped that whether you love Trump or hate Trump folks we
[1:28:39.880 --> 1:28:43.960]  need to keep that organization in place it's pure populism Ali Alexander's our

[1:31:56.320 --> 1:32:01.240]  the eugenicist over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans
[1:32:01.240 --> 1:32:06.680]  they financed major universities they ran full-page stories and advertisements
[1:32:06.680 --> 1:32:10.560]  pushing their propaganda of the New York Times other major newspapers that the
[1:32:10.560 --> 1:32:15.640]  family as we know it is a bad thing and must be ended and the first step in that
[1:32:15.640 --> 1:32:20.600]  is getting women out of the household and teaching women that cooking dinner and
[1:32:20.600 --> 1:32:24.520]  taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing and I was
[1:32:24.520 --> 1:32:28.560]  just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter my four-national daughter
[1:32:28.560 --> 1:32:31.680]  my wife makes dinner a lot of times but I like to make it as well I love to make
[1:32:31.680 --> 1:32:35.840]  breakfast and literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your
[1:32:35.840 --> 1:32:40.520]  family and be nurturative and then all sit down together and have the communal
[1:32:40.520 --> 1:32:45.800]  event that's what the system is attacking and bombarding is our normal
[1:32:45.800 --> 1:32:51.000]  biological actions are coming together they really are sick evil scientific
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:55.520]  cult of filth and want to domesticate us and turn us into lab rats we cannot let
[1:32:55.520 --> 1:33:02.960]  this continue leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's
[1:33:02.960 --> 1:33:06.200]  Alex Jones
[1:33:07.600 --> 1:33:14.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny
[1:33:14.680 --> 1:33:23.440]  feel so does he lie from the info wars com studios it's Alex Jones so I've
[1:33:23.440 --> 1:33:28.880]  been critical of Trump and so is Ali Alexander but we understand he means well
[1:33:28.880 --> 1:33:33.000]  he's a major populace leader or the greatest presence us history took on
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:36.920]  the globalist toe-to-toe rebuilt America overnight that's why they're threatened
[1:33:36.920 --> 1:33:41.000]  by that's why they attack him because they hate his supporters of every race
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:45.800]  color and creep but make no mistake there is a battle with the Republican
[1:33:45.800 --> 1:33:50.080]  Party and there is a battle with the Democrats to destroy Trump and to take
[1:33:50.080 --> 1:33:53.720]  Republican congressmen and women off the ballot and senators claiming because
[1:33:53.720 --> 1:33:59.640]  they supported challenging an election that they now can't run for election but
[1:33:59.640 --> 1:34:03.080]  that's in the Constitution you can challenge an election it was constitutional
[1:34:03.080 --> 1:34:06.800]  with Ted Cruz and others were doing so their idea is to say you're disqualified
[1:34:06.800 --> 1:34:10.560]  they're becoming in their own action what they claim they are well they're
[1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:14.720]  saying you can't even vote for the person they can't even be on the ballot
[1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:18.960]  that's the ultimate form of rigging things so elaborate on that Ali Alexander
[1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:22.080]  what you're getting in of how they're trying to destroy make America great
[1:34:22.080 --> 1:34:31.360]  again yeah so our our our strength is that we live in a a union of states
[1:34:31.360 --> 1:34:37.640]  federalism and what the Marxist with the Luciferians with the New World Order is
[1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:43.200]  attempting to do is to make our strength our weakness and so instead of having a
[1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:50.360]  union of states that sends different vibrant people you know wackos to the
[1:34:50.360 --> 1:34:56.160]  non-wackos to the capital to represent the people what's what's instead happened
[1:34:56.160 --> 1:34:59.840]  is like we have two corporate party you know they fund wars and they fund
[1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:04.560]  corporations that's it and then we all argue about the social issues but all of
[1:35:04.560 --> 1:35:08.400]  that's on the slippery slope of liberalism and but what's happening is
[1:35:08.400 --> 1:35:14.720]  they've decided Mark Elias has decided very well funded Democrat lawyer has
[1:35:14.720 --> 1:35:20.800]  decided that well I will take a dozen states and I will find one that works
[1:35:20.800 --> 1:35:25.880]  for me and the one that works for me will be a swing state an electoral vote
[1:35:25.880 --> 1:35:30.320]  that Trump needs and so when a lot of people don't understand a lot of people
[1:35:30.320 --> 1:35:35.000]  ask me I'll leave why can't we create a patriot party I say well ballot access
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:40.680]  laws it takes about a decade before a party can get on the ballot in all 50
[1:35:40.680 --> 1:35:44.600]  states it can't just show up and you can't just write in half the states in
[1:35:44.600 --> 1:35:51.240]  our union do not allow for the counting of write-in votes so some states even if
[1:35:51.240 --> 1:35:56.120]  you if somebody won with 99% and they were written in it wouldn't count and
[1:35:56.120 --> 1:35:59.360]  so a lot of patriots don't know this because they're familiar with their
[1:35:59.360 --> 1:36:04.080]  local their local laws and their their ballots but but they're not familiar with
[1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:07.440]  the rest of the country and because I've worked all over the country and you
[1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:11.040]  know other other patriot operatives like Rogers just don't have to you know we
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:15.560]  realize where that's vulnerable so what we may see and I I've never I've never
[1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:20.160]  said this publicly this will be a first time ever is what I believe the deep
[1:36:20.160 --> 1:36:26.000]  state is going to ultimately come to is they will either criminally refer
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:32.520]  Trump and then choose very publicly to not prosecute him and then in some of
[1:36:32.520 --> 1:36:37.640]  those states throw him off the ballot under that pretence alone or worse they
[1:36:37.640 --> 1:36:43.160]  won't criminally refer him but the DOJ will charge him independently Biden
[1:36:43.160 --> 1:36:47.000]  will pardon him and then they will use that to take him off the ballots so
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:51.560]  imagine and you know you and I've had interactions with Trump you know where
[1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:55.960]  Trump is so full of righteousness and pride and says well I'm gonna be on the
[1:36:55.960 --> 1:37:01.520]  ballot in 48 days I'm gonna run anyway it's the right thing to do and we will
[1:37:01.520 --> 1:37:06.720]  be naive to the tsunami we're against well what does that do that incentivizes
[1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:11.360]  not the Republican Party to implode but MAGA to implode because then there will
[1:37:11.360 --> 1:37:15.680]  be very reasonable people saying well why not let General Flynn run or why not
[1:37:15.680 --> 1:37:21.200]  let Ron DeSantis run and so what the deep state seeks to do is to not stab us
[1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:26.120]  in the back but to get our best friend to stab us in the back I think Trump is
[1:37:26.120 --> 1:37:31.440]  the best way to get new black votes new Hispanic votes the woman vote and turn
[1:37:31.440 --> 1:37:34.920]  out and max out the white vote okay I think Trump is the only way the
[1:37:34.920 --> 1:37:40.320]  Republicans win that being said if they only put him on 48 ballots or something
[1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:44.480]  like that there is gonna be a legitimate debate to be had and so that's the
[1:37:44.480 --> 1:37:48.720]  existential crisis we have is tens of millions of Americans will want to
[1:37:48.720 --> 1:37:53.800]  participate in a system and it will be you know the illusion will be gone Alex
[1:37:53.800 --> 1:37:58.000]  and John terrified that they're staging a false flag they're gonna divide your
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:02.480]  Republican Party but worse they will invert they will invert the MAGA
[1:38:02.480 --> 1:38:06.920]  movement this beautiful movement that is collection of patriots and believers
[1:38:06.920 --> 1:38:12.560]  and you know I'm watching in his slow motion through the persecution of you
[1:38:12.560 --> 1:38:20.000]  and I well that's right in closing I'll say this they put out that report in June
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:23.280]  of last year saying our main enemy is people that question elections or
[1:38:23.280 --> 1:38:27.200]  lockdowns or forced injections and then just about a month ago the FBI
[1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:32.960]  just put an official plan saying we believe right-wingers are gonna blow
[1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:36.640]  stuff up and kill people and launch terror attacks over Trump had in the
[1:38:36.640 --> 1:38:41.280]  election stolen as if we do that so they're framing everyone to have another
[1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:47.480]  election steal that if we question will be at fault for the school or government
[1:38:47.480 --> 1:38:52.040]  building or university or police station it gets blown up obviously we have no
[1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:56.000]  motive to do that to demonize ourselves obviously we had no motive to break in
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:59.680]  the Capitol but we see all the pre-programming and preparation for
[1:38:59.680 --> 1:39:05.360]  that it's clear that's the next phase it's the next phase in our country has now
[1:39:05.360 --> 1:39:09.120]  said that civil disobedience which is which is the great tradition of this
[1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:14.400]  country it's what gave blacks equal access to water fountains and and public
[1:39:14.400 --> 1:39:18.160]  institutions public accommodation I should say because it also includes
[1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:22.600]  private institutions they're saying that that's outlawed and the left is over
[1:39:22.600 --> 1:39:26.640]  they're snickering ha ha ha it's Alex Jones and it's Ali Alexander it's you
[1:39:26.640 --> 1:39:31.600]  next the president has been said they didn't prosecute Antifa but they'll
[1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:36.080]  sure as hell prosecute you okay there we are gonna live in a future where there
[1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:41.360]  are no masks and they're gonna get you and so what what what people of all
[1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:47.000]  strikes need to realize is that if you persecute Alex Jones who is a media
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:54.120]  publisher as if he's some militia leader then what's the stop the non-corporate
[1:39:54.120 --> 1:40:00.320]  lefty press from then being prosecuted if you prosecute Ali Alexander who on
[1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:06.240]  his own time and own dime ran activism instead of worked on a campaign then
[1:40:06.240 --> 1:40:11.920]  what's the stop the next civil rights movement on the left starting and you
[1:40:11.920 --> 1:40:15.400]  know accomplishing something greater or something stupid but you know or
[1:40:15.400 --> 1:40:21.800]  something at all you know so it can't be overstated that we live in the most
[1:40:21.800 --> 1:40:27.200]  consequential time there has never been a committee not with Joseph McCarthy not
[1:40:27.200 --> 1:40:32.040]  with anybody else like the J6 committee that was exclusively appointed by one
[1:40:32.040 --> 1:40:37.560]  party that has a limited subpoena power that can criminally refer anyone when
[1:40:37.560 --> 1:40:40.720]  they don't like what Merrick Barlin's doing they just call over to Joe Biden
[1:40:40.720 --> 1:40:45.040]  say put pressure on him and they threaten I've heard from my sources they've
[1:40:45.040 --> 1:40:51.320]  threatened multiple times Merrick Garland signed his paper or resign and the guys
[1:40:51.320 --> 1:40:56.800]  are signing it you know because he's a moderate lunatic and so you know what we
[1:40:56.800 --> 1:41:01.080]  need is prayer what we need is diligence what we need is discernment above all
[1:41:01.080 --> 1:41:06.120]  else because we can't fall for these info traps these side-offs to divide us
[1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:10.720]  and we just got to be aware and we've got to act as a family we've got to act as
[1:41:10.720 --> 1:41:16.480]  a unit but again like I said they've cut Trump's strategists they've cut the
[1:41:16.480 --> 1:41:19.600]  organizers of the movement like you and me they've cut our lines of
[1:41:19.600 --> 1:41:24.920]  communications this is what you do in war and they are treating us like we are
[1:41:24.920 --> 1:41:29.640]  at war and so we are we are in a we are in a soft civil war and it's one where
[1:41:29.640 --> 1:41:33.840]  the right hasn't even punched back Frank you're right because the right wing and
[1:41:33.840 --> 1:41:36.840]  the conservatives and Christians just act like we're still in America we're
[1:41:36.840 --> 1:41:41.040]  not we're in the middle of a globalist takeover at every level there's silence
[1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:44.920]  in their opposition they're suing their attacking they are demonizing and it's
[1:41:44.920 --> 1:41:48.360]  very very sad thing to see but thank God we're on air exposing it and they
[1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:53.040]  still couldn't convict these poor folks at the FBI set up and was ordering to
[1:41:53.040 --> 1:41:56.960]  kidnap the I don't want to kidnap the governor and then they indict the young
[1:41:56.960 --> 1:42:00.960]  guy that he said he didn't want to do it well the FBI gets more guilty than him
[1:42:00.960 --> 1:42:04.520]  he's like I don't want to do it you better do it come out with us and and
[1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:07.800]  and and lark around like you're gonna kidnap the governor that is so wrong
[1:42:07.800 --> 1:42:12.760]  Ali Alexander thank you so much for the time hey thanks Alex thank you I always
[1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:15.960]  liked Ali but he's he's really had a lot of courage and notice they spin his
[1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:21.680]  courage into Ali Alexander is cooperating he will soon put Trump in
[1:42:21.680 --> 1:42:28.720]  jail you get one of these Justice Department subpoenas from a grand jury
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:34.160]  and you don't comply you're gonna go to prison and that's just where we are in
[1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:37.840]  this country and it's not you're hiding anything but it is just they just make
[1:42:37.840 --> 1:42:43.800]  you come make you testify for days or weeks with all these prosecutors trying
[1:42:43.800 --> 1:42:47.360]  to twist what you're actually thinking so they can do it it's just ridiculous
[1:42:47.360 --> 1:42:50.520]  even they have all the footage know we did but it's not about Ali Alexander
[1:42:50.520 --> 1:42:56.600]  myself it's about preparing the false flag to demonize America you know it's
[1:42:56.600 --> 1:43:01.320]  a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it it's just true that info wars is seen
[1:43:01.320 --> 1:43:08.160]  by the globalist as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human
[1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:12.840]  populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program and
[1:43:12.840 --> 1:43:20.000]  man our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've

[1:52:43.360 --> 1:52:46.640]  that really works and i've experienced it every day they may have the controlled
[1:52:46.640 --> 1:52:50.280]  media and they may have the big banks they may have the universities they may
[1:52:50.280 --> 1:52:53.760]  have most of the police departments but they don't have our hearts and souls and
[1:52:53.760 --> 1:53:00.200]  they don't have control the people and the people know that the persecution of
[1:53:00.200 --> 1:53:05.560]  this broadcast and the demonization of this broadcast and the attacks of these
[1:53:05.560 --> 1:53:12.240]  shows and the media and what we do is a testament to liberty and they're smart
[1:53:12.240 --> 1:53:18.200]  enough to know if the system that lies to me hates this man he must really be

[1:53:39.600 --> 1:53:43.680]  and millions billions of exaggeration they find a few times were wrong and a

[1:54:00.840 --> 1:54:06.480]  for humanity and these sociopaths and these satanists they look at those of us
[1:54:06.480 --> 1:54:09.400]  that fight for liberty and freedom because we have empathy and we love
[1:54:09.400 --> 1:54:12.840]  humanity and they think we're weak they're like what's wrong you kid you

[1:59:02.800 --> 1:59:07.120]  infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of
[1:59:07.120 --> 1:59:10.960]  millions of dollars and now with band-aid video getting close to 10 million
[1:59:10.960 --> 1:59:15.400]  views a day we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and
[1:59:15.400 --> 1:59:20.920]  groups to be able to post their content free of charge and because it's become
[1:59:20.920 --> 1:59:26.480]  so successful it's a catch 22 info wars and band-aid video have become a
[1:59:26.480 --> 1:59:30.560]  mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide but the
[1:59:30.560 --> 1:59:35.400]  expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter hundreds and

[1:59:56.440 --> 2:00:02.920]  their mom their mom barring us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[2:00:02.920 --> 2:00:07.520]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're
[2:00:07.520 --> 2:00:11.160]  doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of God the
[2:00:11.160 --> 2:00:17.360]  creator and we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much so
[2:00:17.360 --> 2:00:21.040]  that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came
[2:00:21.040 --> 2:00:27.840]  up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be necessary if the
[2:00:27.840 --> 2:00:32.960]  situation was hopeless they need all their propaganda at all as an all their
[2:00:32.960 --> 2:00:39.080]  evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they
[2:00:39.080 --> 2:00:43.280]  know in the end they signed on God of this world who is a loser and that's why
[2:00:43.280 --> 2:00:46.280]  it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever
[2:00:46.280 --> 2:00:50.520]  because even you don't believe in God what the globalists are manifesting and
[2:00:50.520 --> 2:00:59.760]  saying up is satanic is just the beginning what they have planned for our
[2:00:59.760 --> 2:01:03.440]  little ones I wish to raise a matter of the say this afternoon for the
[2:01:03.440 --> 2:01:07.680]  attention of the Minister for Education and I have to say it is not often in
[2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:12.120]  this job I am absolutely shocked I thought I'd seen everything but this
[2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:20.560]  one is is just just beyond words it is a a note from a constituent who says
[2:01:20.560 --> 2:01:24.080]  hi Bernie this is a worksheet that my 10-year-old daughter brought home from
[2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:28.320]  school and it includes a photo of the worksheet part of her homework was to
[2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:36.400]  discuss with her father his erections and ejaculation I find this very
[2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:42.160]  disturbing and sickening as indeed do I have to say what the hell is going on in
[2:01:42.160 --> 2:01:47.000]  this state when 10-year-old girls are told to go home and talk to your father
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:51.280]  about his erections and about his ejaculations what the hell is going on
[2:01:51.280 --> 2:01:55.360]  here we're delighted that the family sex show will be on in May I'm gonna hand
[2:01:55.360 --> 2:01:59.400]  over to Josie the artistic director of this thing to say a little more I run
[2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:03.240]  this egg and I have been making and producing the family sex show along
[2:02:03.240 --> 2:02:07.480]  with lots of other people over the last few years family sex show is a fun and
[2:02:07.480 --> 2:02:13.120]  playful show for adults and children age five and up it offers an honest human
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:18.960]  sex education that is feminist queer non-binary inclusive and sex positive
[2:02:18.960 --> 2:02:24.120]  this show can allow audiences of all ages to feel confident about their bodies
[2:02:24.120 --> 2:02:29.280]  their boundaries and their sexual health and we really hope to see you here so
[2:02:29.280 --> 2:02:31.960]  those of us that stand up for the little ones they're gonna be attacked we're
[2:02:31.960 --> 2:02:35.720]  gonna be demonized we're gonna be shot we're gonna be killed we're gonna be in
[2:02:35.720 --> 2:02:39.120]  prison we're gonna be tortured we're gonna be a lot of things gonna happen to a
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:44.160]  lot of us but at the end of the day ladies and gentlemen God is watching and
[2:02:44.160 --> 2:02:50.400]  God is in control and those evil doers carrying these wicked deeds out will pay
[2:02:50.400 --> 2:02:56.400]  please he asked these 118 is for in much wisdom is much grief and he that
[2:02:56.400 --> 2:03:02.040]  increases knowledge increases sorrow I have much knowledge and I have much
[2:03:02.040 --> 2:03:07.560]  sorrow much sorrow for the hundreds of millions of innocent people starving to
[2:03:07.560 --> 2:03:12.240]  death right now we're looking at 260 million people and I'm not talking about
[2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:18.720]  hungry I'm talking about marching towards starvation and that is a catastrophe
[2:03:18.720 --> 2:03:23.600]  in itself lockdowns around the world have led to labor shortages supply chain
[2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:29.040]  disruption and a reduction in international trade the result less
[2:03:29.040 --> 2:03:37.560]  available food and less money to pay for it it's a deadly combination and we've
[2:03:37.560 --> 2:03:41.520]  got to act now and we got to be smart and we got to thread the needle you can't
[2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:46.120]  you can't just deal with COVID by itself or hunger by itself they must be dealt
[2:03:46.120 --> 2:03:50.440]  with together if we do it right we can save lives if we don't do it right
[2:03:50.440 --> 2:03:56.360]  people will die we go to our football games and watch our sitcoms and then
[2:03:56.360 --> 2:04:01.360]  people that are living in pockets still of Western freedom Western wealth just
[2:04:01.360 --> 2:04:05.440]  go about their business playing golf and tennis and having fun and going to
[2:04:05.440 --> 2:04:11.080]  movies and as the water rises for those final islands of safety and security
[2:04:11.080 --> 2:04:16.200]  will finally be engulfed but ignorance is blessed right but we are about to see
[2:04:16.200 --> 2:04:20.840]  the world we've known destroyed and on its ashes built a system designed to
[2:04:20.840 --> 2:04:25.320]  destroy the human that's made the image of God it's a very painful thing to see
[2:04:25.320 --> 2:04:30.080]  the spirit of evil spreading its black wings over the earth and sinking its
[2:04:30.080 --> 2:04:36.080]  long stinking fangs in our children's very souls that is the price of
[2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:39.800]  consciousness and free will for good is not the only thing in the universe evil
[2:04:39.800 --> 2:04:44.360]  dwells there as well and it is when those good spirits do not stand up and
[2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:49.040]  fight for innocence that innocence is destroyed and then the blood of the
[2:04:49.040 --> 2:04:52.880]  children is on our hands
[2:04:58.320 --> 2:05:02.520]  it's about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand in for worse I've been on here a
[2:05:02.520 --> 2:05:06.640]  couple years but I only had money to finance my own simple little local
[2:05:06.640 --> 2:05:09.960]  radio show and I wanted to hire camera people I wanted to make films I wanted
[2:05:09.960 --> 2:05:14.000]  to really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt I designed the first one
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:19.400]  mass murderers agree gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first
[2:05:19.400 --> 2:05:23.480]  two members of my crew that's our oldest design and we're still selling we have
[2:05:23.480 --> 2:05:27.080]  that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited to issues
[2:05:27.080 --> 2:05:31.400]  because whatever stock we've got in that's it we're selling everything out
[2:05:31.400 --> 2:05:35.400]  to find the operation to get rid of inventory we'll still have some teachers
[2:05:35.400 --> 2:05:38.920]  in the future they'll just be limited editions and short runs so if you want
[2:05:38.920 --> 2:05:43.280]  to get any of these historic shirts this is your last chance I almost forgot we're

[2:05:58.680 --> 2:06:09.360]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[2:06:16.680 --> 2:06:20.360]  well I was sitting there last week thinking about how important this is I
[2:06:20.360 --> 2:06:24.640]  thought can I get him to fly in the town he did it because I want to bring
[2:06:24.640 --> 2:06:27.480]  things to listeners that help our broadcasts down the air and fight the
[2:06:27.480 --> 2:06:30.480]  globalists and that help you and that help the folks that are helping you a
[2:06:30.480 --> 2:06:35.360]  360 win a non-zero some game and I've gotten so much great feedback in the
[2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:39.520]  last few months as we've been promoting Tyler Bennett and American Tax Solutions
[2:06:39.520 --> 2:06:43.680]  and the site that's connected to it so we get the sponsorship support Jones
[2:06:43.680 --> 2:06:50.000]  taxrelief.com that I wanted to just have him back on because listen here's the
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:54.160]  thing the New World Order takes over by you being in the dark and you not
[2:06:54.160 --> 2:06:57.760]  knowing how things work as Christ said my people perish for lack of knowledge
[2:06:57.760 --> 2:07:03.800]  and it's like trying to drive a car without gasoline or it's like trying to
[2:07:03.800 --> 2:07:08.000]  go out in a snowstorm without a jacket or your pants on your boots on to not
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:13.880]  know the tax code the US was written so rich people don't pay it and middle
[2:07:13.880 --> 2:07:18.360]  class and poor people do and there's so many functions and so many facets we
[2:07:18.360 --> 2:07:22.600]  couldn't run our business without tax lawyers this guy's one of the best with
[2:07:22.600 --> 2:07:29.800]  fast-acting help that's inexpensive and amazing so we're talking about 9%
[2:07:29.800 --> 2:07:35.880]  savings for almost nothing I mean again I want you to know the tactics the
[2:07:35.880 --> 2:07:40.080]  establishments using this is just like a car needs wheels it needs tires it needs
[2:07:40.080 --> 2:07:44.640]  an engine you need to know about this and not just accept the system that your
[2:07:44.640 --> 2:07:49.280]  employer says or accept the system that you're being told by your CPA so Tyler
[2:07:49.280 --> 2:07:53.160]  Bennett is a tax professional lawyer the owner operator of tax for American tax
[2:07:53.160 --> 2:07:57.720]  solutions I've used them had family use them don't tax relief comm takes you
[2:07:57.720 --> 2:08:01.840]  right to the subpage where we get sponsor support when you work with them
[2:08:01.840 --> 2:08:06.240]  they've got so many great services so Tyler Bennett great to have you back
[2:08:06.240 --> 2:08:10.240]  with us today on this Monday edition tell us about some of the services and
[2:08:10.240 --> 2:08:13.440]  some of the stories and what's unfolding what's happening because
[2:08:13.440 --> 2:08:18.320]  listeners really need to know this is one of the few areas in our lives with
[2:08:18.320 --> 2:08:21.920]  these plunging economies and dollars being devalued and currencies being
[2:08:21.920 --> 2:08:27.040]  valued where we can really get a leg up that's right Alex and it's great to be
[2:08:27.040 --> 2:08:30.800]  back on the show and here's the thing that I want to tell everybody first and
[2:08:30.800 --> 2:08:36.520]  foremost as you are probably where April 18th is the filing deadline right so if
[2:08:36.520 --> 2:08:39.640]  you haven't thought about it yet we definitely need to make sure that you're
[2:08:39.640 --> 2:08:43.160]  headed the right path so you're not because if you file late you pay late
[2:08:43.160 --> 2:08:47.640]  guess what you're stuck with penalties and interests and that's money that's
[2:08:47.640 --> 2:08:52.400]  going to support people that do not like you that are against you as Alex was
[2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:56.880]  just saying right so you want your money to go again to go for the globalist as
[2:08:56.880 --> 2:09:02.160]  least as possible stay in your pocket and so you can support the things that you
[2:09:02.160 --> 2:09:07.360]  want to your church your small business and not the globalist agenda so and
[2:09:07.360 --> 2:09:10.040]  then that was crazy I want to promote things that work really well like hey
[2:09:10.040 --> 2:09:14.120]  take D3 you won't get all these viruses or hey brush your teeth is good or hey
[2:09:14.120 --> 2:09:17.880]  drink filter water like they've written the tax code here in the US so we have
[2:09:17.880 --> 2:09:22.920]  the most corrupt tax code I would say absolutely Alex explain the tax code
[2:09:22.920 --> 2:09:27.120]  first to them because again it's written for the establishment by lawyers so
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:31.240]  they're exempt but we're not absolutely so if we look historically here the tax
[2:09:31.240 --> 2:09:36.280]  code was written was put in the law of the 16th Amendment in 1913 and since
[2:09:36.280 --> 2:09:42.120]  that day forward the globalist lobbyist parties have been able to put in
[2:09:42.120 --> 2:09:49.400]  extremely hard to understand for the layperson deductions and credits and
[2:09:49.400 --> 2:09:53.280]  loopholes that they already know about because they lobbied to put it in the
[2:09:53.280 --> 2:09:57.840]  tax code in the first place and so what we aim to do and are successful at doing
[2:09:57.840 --> 2:10:02.440]  it is providing those exact same deductions and loopholes to the small
[2:10:02.440 --> 2:10:07.320]  business owner to the average American who the globalists would love for you to
[2:10:07.320 --> 2:10:12.400]  support their entire regime while they skate by paying nothing so they can have
[2:10:12.400 --> 2:10:16.640]  another yacht so let's talk about the services let's talk about some of the
[2:10:16.640 --> 2:10:22.160]  ideas because this is a win-win and it's a news item as well absolutely Alex so
[2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:27.440]  first and foremost okay there is the standard deduction and itemized
[2:10:27.440 --> 2:10:31.840]  deductions right the reason the standard deduction was created is because the
[2:10:31.840 --> 2:10:35.760]  globalists don't want more people writing off as much as they can in taxes so
[2:10:35.760 --> 2:10:39.440]  they say unless you can surmount the standard deduction which is twelve
[2:10:39.440 --> 2:10:43.680]  thousand four hundred dollars then you can't take any itemized deductions now
[2:10:43.680 --> 2:10:47.320]  interestingly enough Alex this is one of the things that Hunter Biden is going
[2:10:47.320 --> 2:10:51.680]  to get in trouble for but I digress the thing is is if you go to one of these
[2:10:51.680 --> 2:10:56.600]  big box tax stores they're not going to necessarily give you all the deductions
[2:10:56.600 --> 2:11:01.120]  that you are entitled to and the reason is this when you go to a big box store
[2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:05.720]  you're treated like everyone is the exact same but everyone's tax situation
[2:11:05.720 --> 2:11:09.760]  is completely unique there are no two taxpayers they are the same and so it
[2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:15.400]  needs to be treated with a best stoke level of care so that you get and pay
[2:11:15.400 --> 2:11:19.800]  the least amount of tax as possible right right down just some of the facts
[2:11:19.800 --> 2:11:22.960]  some of the known historic points that big corporations use that little people
[2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:28.960]  could use as well they're completely legal absolutely so one that that is so
[2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:33.000]  big that everyone needs to know is if you're planning on starting a business
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:38.080]  there's up to five thousand cot excuse me five thousand dollars in deductible
[2:11:38.080 --> 2:11:42.200]  expenses before you even start your business so if you know that that means
[2:11:42.200 --> 2:11:45.000]  you might be more likely to go out there and actually start that business
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:49.720]  instead of staying where you're at okay another one is you have to know
[2:11:49.720 --> 2:11:53.960]  everything that's deductible versus what's income a big example and what
[2:11:53.960 --> 2:11:58.320]  corporations do to their shareholders is let's say I'm the shareholder of a
[2:11:58.320 --> 2:12:02.560]  corporation I can receive a loan from my own company tax-free as long as I'm
[2:12:02.560 --> 2:12:05.880]  paying interest on it these are the kind of things that the globalists do to not
[2:12:05.880 --> 2:12:09.760]  pay taxes and this is the kind of thing that if you're also in the correct
[2:12:09.760 --> 2:12:13.880]  entities set up you could take advantage of as well another thing is
[2:12:13.880 --> 2:12:17.960]  research and development costs marketing costs once you're involved in a
[2:12:17.960 --> 2:12:23.360]  business almost everything is deductible and that's the thing that you're not
[2:12:23.360 --> 2:12:27.280]  going to get from you know Joe Schmo's accounting firm down at the corner
[2:12:27.280 --> 2:12:30.280]  because they're not advocates and we are and what we're going to do is make sure
[2:12:30.280 --> 2:12:34.280]  you're paying the least amount as possible every year why do the other big
[2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:39.880]  law firms and some of the CPAs not give you real service how do they just it's
[2:12:39.880 --> 2:12:45.520]  documented that I think even like Money Magazine 30 years ago said we did 50
[2:12:45.520 --> 2:12:50.000]  different tax returns with 50 CPAs they were all different why don't they give
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:55.160]  the public what the elite get well so Alex it's a two-fold reason right so
[2:12:55.160 --> 2:12:59.200]  first of all and the honest truth is a lot of these CPAs a lot of these firms
[2:12:59.200 --> 2:13:03.480]  are not currently up to date on the ever-changing tax code which changes
[2:13:03.480 --> 2:13:08.920]  every year they're lazy and and it's just they're not up to date right because
[2:13:08.920 --> 2:13:12.680]  the tax code changes with whenever the lobbies decide to change the tax code
[2:13:12.680 --> 2:13:16.200]  and that's what makes it so confounding to the layperson that's what makes it so
[2:13:16.200 --> 2:13:20.200]  hard for you just to go out there and file a tax return on your own and not
[2:13:20.200 --> 2:13:26.680]  get screwed over because it changes so often to fit there both their you know
[2:13:26.680 --> 2:13:31.040]  needs and also to keep you in the dark on purpose and then the other reason is
[2:13:31.040 --> 2:13:36.640]  Alex these major law firms the big four accounting firms the big five law firms
[2:13:36.640 --> 2:13:43.000]  they have a vested interest in keeping their blue chip clients happy and that's
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:47.200]  really all they want is to accept millions of dollars from these globalists
[2:13:47.200 --> 2:13:51.960]  to perform the services which are available to much many more people than
[2:13:51.960 --> 2:13:55.240]  that but they want to keep the door shut because they don't want to let you
[2:13:55.240 --> 2:13:59.640]  part of their club why say you're invited to my club come on in well that's
[2:13:59.640 --> 2:14:02.720]  it you're letting them know the tricks that's right and people can find it all
[2:14:02.720 --> 2:14:07.040]  at jonestaxrelief.com it's a sub page of all the same services we just get
[2:14:07.040 --> 2:14:10.960]  credit and sponsorship support at the great American tax solutions company
[2:14:10.960 --> 2:14:15.700]  with Tyler Bennett and again it's very frustrating that people keep this
[2:14:15.700 --> 2:14:21.120]  Promethean fire from the public absolutely and I want to add if you if you
[2:14:21.120 --> 2:14:27.240]  have crypto assets whether you've bought sold or just holding the IRS is right
[2:14:27.240 --> 2:14:32.160]  after you see this article I have IRS right now is trying to seize more money
[2:14:32.160 --> 2:14:37.560]  this year in crypto assets and they did last year they see 3.5 billion last
[2:14:37.560 --> 2:14:41.840]  year so that's a lot of money they're coming after the middle class per usual
[2:14:41.840 --> 2:14:47.000]  and so what you need to do is make sure that when you file you're filing in the
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:51.640]  correct way someone who understands crypto taxes is doing it and you need to
[2:14:51.640 --> 2:14:55.960]  do it sooner rather than later because the tax deadline is coming up and I can
[2:14:55.960 --> 2:15:00.920]  talk about extensions so most people are gonna file an extension or their
[2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:04.560]  accountant is going to tell them right well your accountant doesn't tell you
[2:15:04.560 --> 2:15:08.600]  is if you file an extension and don't pay you're still stuck with the penalties
[2:15:08.600 --> 2:15:13.680]  for not paying there is no extension to pay your taxes it's only to file now you
[2:15:13.680 --> 2:15:16.600]  must file your taxes otherwise it's it's against the law and you don't want to
[2:15:16.600 --> 2:15:21.720]  break the law because then they'll come after you extra hard so if you know Joe
[2:15:21.720 --> 2:15:25.360]  blow accountant is filing extension for your fine extension on yourself it's
[2:15:25.360 --> 2:15:29.480]  more likely than not you're doing it incorrectly and you're gonna pay the
[2:15:29.480 --> 2:15:33.200]  government more than you actually owe in terms of penalties and interest now if
[2:15:33.200 --> 2:15:37.160]  we do it correctly for you you'll pay exactly what you owe if you owe anything
[2:15:37.160 --> 2:15:43.360]  at all alright Tyler Bennett Jones tax relief calm is our guest there's this
[2:15:43.360 --> 2:15:47.040]  is the real silver lining to all this corruption knowing the tricks the
[2:15:47.040 --> 2:15:50.800]  establishment uses none of the taxes used to fund the country it's all for

[2:19:57.440 --> 2:20:24.200]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[2:20:24.200 --> 2:20:29.040]  tax professionals with the great work he does in American tax solutions as a
[2:20:29.040 --> 2:20:36.000]  subdomain jonestaxrelief.com or 833-900-4285 and it's real simple you
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:40.240]  read about Google paying zero tax you read about IBM paying zero tax you read
[2:20:40.240 --> 2:20:46.360]  about Microsoft paying 1% you read about all that Elon Musk says I'm not gonna do
[2:20:46.360 --> 2:20:50.280]  that I'll pay 10% he's even pointing that out I'm not lionizing him it just he
[2:20:50.280 --> 2:20:53.680]  does pay more than they do they run all these offshore tax camps this is an
[2:20:53.680 --> 2:20:58.000]  offshore stuff we're talking about this is in the US tax code to cut taxes with
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:04.160]  one designation a corporation from 40 to 20 and you explain on this is like so
[2:21:04.160 --> 2:21:08.280]  frustrating that I like tell people I'll be sitting in a restaurant here people
[2:21:08.280 --> 2:21:12.640]  like going man I got a 40% tax bracket and I'm going bankrupt man I can't pay
[2:21:12.640 --> 2:21:16.320]  for the bills I go hey you know you can like sign up a special corporation make
[2:21:16.320 --> 2:21:20.880]  it 20% right now they go yeah all right buddy like everybody wouldn't everybody
[2:21:20.880 --> 2:21:25.440]  would know that if it was true they don't know they think it's weird that
[2:21:25.440 --> 2:21:29.760]  you're warning them explain that to them that's absolutely right Alex since 2017
[2:21:29.760 --> 2:21:35.320]  the TCJ changed the Republican tax overhaul changed the tax code from the
[2:21:35.320 --> 2:21:41.480]  corporate tax rate was 35% now it is 21% it has been since 2017 and as we were
[2:21:41.480 --> 2:21:46.440]  previously saying a lot of these CPAs and tax repairs aren't up to date on the
[2:21:46.440 --> 2:21:51.240]  law even one that's five years ago and so they don't necessarily know that what
[2:21:51.240 --> 2:21:55.480]  the best entity to be in but the C Corp is the best entity to be in since 2017
[2:21:55.480 --> 2:22:00.680]  if you are a business you're making lots of revenue or you're making money so
[2:22:00.680 --> 2:22:04.800]  the thing is this is absolutely what the globalists use because through
[2:22:04.800 --> 2:22:10.640]  international taxation which is a true pay-to-play concept in that if you have
[2:22:10.640 --> 2:22:15.320]  enough money you are a globalist that you can use the tax treaties between the
[2:22:15.320 --> 2:22:22.800]  United States and other NATO countries Ireland United Kingdom to lower let's
[2:22:22.800 --> 2:22:26.240]  say Apple is an example of a company that does this the effective tax rate
[2:22:26.240 --> 2:22:29.600]  between what they pay globally well that's just an option that's not
[2:22:29.600 --> 2:22:33.280]  available to most middle-class business owners but that doesn't mean there's
[2:22:33.280 --> 2:22:37.480]  nothing we can do but let me talk for a second about this attack on the middle
[2:22:37.480 --> 2:22:41.000]  class because it doesn't end there okay of course we all know we have record of
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:45.280]  inflation of course we all know because of the war in Ukraine and the
[2:22:45.280 --> 2:22:50.480]  administration's decisions we have higher than ever before gas prices but
[2:22:50.480 --> 2:22:56.400]  here's one more area where you're getting hit is a hidden tax increase and
[2:22:56.400 --> 2:23:03.240]  what I mean is every year taxes go up by a certain index mark of inflation okay
[2:23:03.240 --> 2:23:08.320]  it's about 3% but this year inflation is at 8% so what that means is you're
[2:23:08.320 --> 2:23:12.960]  paying an additional 5% in taxes this year because it didn't the tax rates
[2:23:12.960 --> 2:23:17.400]  didn't go up to match inflation and Biden didn't have to raise taxes to do
[2:23:17.400 --> 2:23:23.040]  that he just gets it so that's what happens and so that's part of the trifecta
[2:23:23.040 --> 2:23:26.440]  it's not just at the pump it's not just that everything including a gallon of
[2:23:26.440 --> 2:23:30.160]  milk cost more but they're gonna get more your taxes because inflation went up
[2:23:30.160 --> 2:23:32.880]  higher than they thought it would because they print off all the money in
[2:23:32.880 --> 2:23:38.160]  the first place wow so talk about again explain people the corporation that
[2:23:38.160 --> 2:23:42.880]  lowers your tax rate by half oh absolutely so there are several different
[2:23:42.880 --> 2:23:47.080]  entities out there everyone likes LLC's LLC does nothing for you there's an S
[2:23:47.080 --> 2:23:50.320]  corp right S corp is still a flow-through entity meaning you're gonna pay
[2:23:50.320 --> 2:23:55.840]  individual tax rates on it there is one flat tax in this entire country and it
[2:23:55.840 --> 2:24:00.120]  is the corporate tax rate the only entities that pay the corporate tax
[2:24:00.120 --> 2:24:04.840]  error what's called C corporations the largest section of the internal revenue
[2:24:04.840 --> 2:24:10.720]  codes about this thick is in regards to C corporations in particular and nothing
[2:24:10.720 --> 2:24:14.640]  else and that's because all the fortune 500 companies all the big guys everyone
[2:24:14.640 --> 2:24:19.720]  traded on New York Stock Exchange etc. is this type of entity for multiple
[2:24:19.720 --> 2:24:25.720]  reasons a C corp is its own citizen in the United States meaning that if it
[2:24:25.720 --> 2:24:29.840]  messes up and owes a lot of taxes well guess what you can sink it and move on
[2:24:29.840 --> 2:24:33.120]  and in most of those situations that's not going to pierce the corporate veil
[2:24:33.120 --> 2:24:38.120]  what that means is be imputed on you personally however it absolutely would
[2:24:38.120 --> 2:24:41.760]  be if you had an LLC or an S corp and you wouldn't be paying 21 and these are
[2:24:41.760 --> 2:24:44.000]  the tricks the establishment uses they don't want to know you're like a
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:48.120]  magician showing people the tricks absolutely see what what Alex what
[2:24:48.120 --> 2:24:52.760]  people don't know is at the end of the day every tax is negotiable especially
[2:24:52.760 --> 2:24:57.440]  if you're paying a large a large enough a tax it's negotiable the IRS is a
[2:24:57.440 --> 2:25:02.280]  collection agency they want their money okay and so our clients never pay one
[2:25:02.280 --> 2:25:06.840]  penny more than they absolutely have to and here's the other thing is you know
[2:25:06.840 --> 2:25:11.360]  when you when you go out there and you see the administration and you don't
[2:25:11.360 --> 2:25:14.760]  agree with what the administration is doing and you see the large technology
[2:25:14.760 --> 2:25:19.400]  companies and you don't agree with their doing I feel I have to tell you that the
[2:25:19.400 --> 2:25:23.680]  big box tax companies are technology companies and so if you don't want to
[2:25:23.680 --> 2:25:29.160]  fund their agenda come over here because we believe in what you believe in you
[2:25:29.160 --> 2:25:34.080]  are friend we have the same ideals well I mean that's it you have basically big
[2:25:34.080 --> 2:25:37.640]  tech running the tax preparing system absolutely they're screwing people as
[2:25:37.640 --> 2:25:41.440]  usual hundred percent because you we already know how they feel a about
[2:25:41.440 --> 2:25:45.960]  conservative viewpoints be about you know keeping people down and requiring the
[2:25:45.960 --> 2:25:49.520]  government or not required but allowing the government to control everybody
[2:25:49.520 --> 2:25:53.280]  that's part of their agenda so if you don't want to support that don't give
[2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:57.960]  them your money it may seem like a simple $500 to H&R block but realize what
[2:25:57.960 --> 2:26:03.240]  that $500 is going to fund continuing because it's not just getting people
[2:26:03.240 --> 2:26:06.760]  that have a big tax bill cutting it down 90% oh absolutely you just get part of
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:11.080]  the savings it's not just you guys have hundreds of services we do like you have
[2:26:11.080 --> 2:26:14.720]  a formula it's well known just people aren't telling people this an average
[2:26:14.720 --> 2:26:17.680]  tax lawyer goes oh give us a thousand dollars we'll meet with you a couple
[2:26:17.680 --> 2:26:20.360]  thousand look at your problem a couple thousand give me the advice a couple
[2:26:20.360 --> 2:26:24.480]  thousand oh you just got right to chase that's right Alex so again as I was
[2:26:24.480 --> 2:26:28.840]  saying before everyone's tax situation is unique but our tax attorneys are able
[2:26:28.840 --> 2:26:33.480]  to cut through the BS and get right to what matters because as I've said before
[2:26:33.480 --> 2:26:38.560]  there are a plethora of different tax issues you could have but it comes down
[2:26:38.560 --> 2:26:44.520]  to basically one of three things right you either need the past which means you
[2:26:44.520 --> 2:26:48.000]  already owe money and they're knocking on your door maybe they filed a lien
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:52.320]  against you they're garnishing your wages we can stop all of that immediately
[2:26:52.320 --> 2:26:55.640]  you need to give us a call right now we'll put an end to it because they're
[2:26:55.640 --> 2:27:00.160]  probably violating your rights and you don't even know it okay because as I
[2:27:00.160 --> 2:27:03.960]  said before the people that are there violating your rights are not attorneys
[2:27:03.960 --> 2:27:07.120]  and they don't necessarily even know or care that they're doing it until an
[2:27:07.120 --> 2:27:12.960]  attorney gets in your pocket and asserts what your rights are okay that's the
[2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:16.360]  past let's say you already owe money if you don't owe money you have the present
[2:27:16.360 --> 2:27:20.200]  that means you need to file for this current tax season it means you want to
[2:27:20.200 --> 2:27:23.680]  pay the least amount of taxes as possible so we got you there but then also
[2:27:23.680 --> 2:27:27.400]  there's the future and that's for a lot of people out there that are doing good
[2:27:27.400 --> 2:27:31.800]  in business the new vareesh I just started a business I'm making more than
[2:27:31.800 --> 2:27:37.720]  I made last year these are the people that we can help it's almost unfathomable
[2:27:37.720 --> 2:27:41.640]  how much money we can save you because if you just blindly go into a business
[2:27:41.640 --> 2:27:46.040]  without the proper tax planning you're gonna get your butt handed to you by the
[2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:50.040]  IRS and by the state because they don't care that you didn't learn this
[2:27:50.040 --> 2:27:53.800]  stuff they just want their money well that's it you don't have a law degree
[2:27:53.800 --> 2:27:58.440]  but they say ignorance the law is no excuse so that's how they get you that's
[2:27:58.440 --> 2:28:02.200]  absolutely correct and the same thing the police would say true but in this in
[2:28:02.200 --> 2:28:06.600]  this instance you know when you grow up you learn right from wrong in a general
[2:28:06.600 --> 2:28:10.080]  matter that oh I shouldn't you know cross the street jaywalk that kind of
[2:28:10.080 --> 2:28:14.040]  thing but you never learned in school the proper way to pay taxes what you had
[2:28:14.040 --> 2:28:18.240]  to save that kind of thing and that's where it's not a total equivalency and
[2:28:18.240 --> 2:28:22.800]  it's completely not fair for the middle class it makes me angry but that's why
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:27.560]  I'm here to get make sure I can get you the biggest discount possible well
[2:28:27.560 --> 2:28:31.360]  frustrating is I don't just get up here and promote stuff cuz your sponsor I
[2:28:31.360 --> 2:28:34.800]  mean I know with real tax attorneys is look at the deal they already have the
[2:28:34.800 --> 2:28:39.280]  code it's it's so easy they know what they're doing but almost no one will do
[2:28:39.280 --> 2:28:42.440]  it because they want to milk people along you want all the customers is giving
[2:28:42.440 --> 2:28:46.760]  the great deal move on absolute on the tracks relief calm Jones tax relief

[2:29:04.080 --> 2:29:08.080]  own simple little local radio show I wanted to hire camera people on the big
[2:29:08.080 --> 2:29:12.320]  films I wanted to really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt I designed
[2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:17.400]  the first one mass murderers agreed gun control works that helped us finance
[2:29:17.400 --> 2:29:21.080]  hiring the first two members of my crew that's our oldest design and we still
[2:29:21.080 --> 2:29:25.280]  selling we have that design over a hundred others that will now all be
[2:29:25.280 --> 2:29:29.000]  limited editions because whatever stop we've got in that's it we're selling
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:33.840]  everything out to find the operation to get rid of inventory we'll still have
[2:29:33.840 --> 2:29:37.440]  some teachers in the future they'll just be limited editions and short runs so if

[2:30:12.920 --> 2:30:16.960]  coin I designed I'm very very proud of it and it will end up being a collectible
[2:30:16.960 --> 2:30:21.400]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for
[2:30:21.400 --> 2:30:26.320]  three times what we sold it we need to sell all 10,000 of these very very
[2:30:26.320 --> 2:30:30.840]  quickly and I appreciate listeners are getting over half of them now I'd like
[2:30:30.840 --> 2:30:34.560]  to move them out very quickly I think they will sell out probably in five or
[2:30:34.560 --> 2:30:40.200]  six more days and without the last coin sale we would not be operating at the
[2:30:40.200 --> 2:30:43.080]  same capacity we've had to lay off a lot of people and that's a big problem so
[2:30:43.080 --> 2:30:46.400]  it was a limited edition collectible tied to our political movement of liberty
[2:30:46.400 --> 2:30:49.520]  and freedom and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems

[2:30:59.960 --> 2:31:06.720]  that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty as the
[2:31:06.720 --> 2:31:12.800]  logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human
[2:31:12.800 --> 2:31:19.560]  program and man our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects

[2:31:59.200 --> 2:32:03.560]  shield basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight I had brain fog like you
[2:32:03.560 --> 2:32:07.760]  wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your
[2:32:07.760 --> 2:32:11.080]  show and I listened to it so the first one I got was the original survival
[2:32:11.080 --> 2:32:15.000]  shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out
[2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:18.280]  with that you know with a deep burden source you know and I got really excited
[2:32:18.280 --> 2:32:22.840]  about that so I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like
[2:32:22.840 --> 2:32:27.440]  literally like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again I could
[2:32:27.440 --> 2:32:31.840]  connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years I
[2:32:31.840 --> 2:32:35.360]  got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements
[2:32:35.360 --> 2:32:39.000]  there they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one I like recently is

[2:32:42.680 --> 2:32:46.800]  works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean yet to break free
[2:32:46.800 --> 2:32:50.640]  of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own help
[2:32:50.640 --> 2:32:54.160]  into our own hand beautifully said brother I thank you so much for your
[2:32:54.160 --> 2:33:01.960]  call and Godspeed leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world

[2:33:06.400 --> 2:33:36.360]  so everything I promote here is what I know is working every
[2:33:36.360 --> 2:33:42.560]  American just like they own a toothbrush or on a car or own a hair dryer or own
[2:33:42.560 --> 2:33:50.600]  a utensils should know the tax code is written super complex so the
[2:33:50.600 --> 2:33:54.680]  establishment doesn't pay taxes and the general public does this is one of the
[2:33:54.680 --> 2:33:58.920]  few ways we can fight back against the establishment they're a great law firm
[2:33:58.920 --> 2:34:01.480]  they have hundreds of people working for them they're ready to service you now
[2:34:01.480 --> 2:34:09.640]  and support the show a 360 win Jones tax relief calm a 3 3 904 to 8 5 a 3 3
[2:34:09.640 --> 2:34:14.960]  904 to 8 5 and we have the owner and a tax lawyer Tyler Bennett Tyler talk
[2:34:14.960 --> 2:34:18.400]  about some of these services and why people should get involved because
[2:34:18.400 --> 2:34:21.880]  you're literally just leaving money on the table absolutely Alex let me talk
[2:34:21.880 --> 2:34:28.440]  about a huge concept in taxation and that is the idea of tax avoidance versus
[2:34:28.440 --> 2:34:32.520]  tax evasion what's the difference because they sound pretty similar right
[2:34:32.520 --> 2:34:37.120]  tax evasion is when you are going against the code therefore breaking the
[2:34:37.120 --> 2:34:42.720]  law to pay less in taxes it's a felony you don't want to do it tax avoidance is
[2:34:42.720 --> 2:34:48.000]  literally the exact same thing but now we're using the loopholes within the
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:53.320]  code to achieve the same result and this is what the elitist and the people do
[2:34:53.320 --> 2:34:59.240]  because the tax code was written so that only the elite can get by and what they
[2:34:59.240 --> 2:35:03.520]  do is they scare the normal people by saying oh if you under report that's
[2:35:03.520 --> 2:35:07.360]  tax evasion and it is don't under report but that doesn't mean that there are
[2:35:07.360 --> 2:35:12.320]  other ways to lower your taxable liability we know all of them and we will
[2:35:12.320 --> 2:35:16.080]  help you out and it depends where you're at in your life whether you're a W2
[2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:21.920]  employee whether you are a crypto investor whether you're a small business
[2:35:21.920 --> 2:35:26.320]  owner that everything is bespoke because your situation is different and we will
[2:35:26.320 --> 2:35:29.000]  treat you accordingly to make sure you're paying the least amount of taxes
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  basically anybody out there unless they're a big globalist corporation
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:36.280]  that's already not paying taxes is gonna benefit from calling you guys yeah I
[2:35:36.280 --> 2:35:40.600]  don't think Apple needs our help but everyone else does and we got you so you
[2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:44.200]  call it's all confidential the lawyers was turning client-privileged you tell
[2:35:44.200 --> 2:35:47.720]  them your info give it to them they give you a prospectus and then it's boom that's
[2:35:47.720 --> 2:35:51.360]  absolutely right so if you call us we will talk to you there we're not one of
[2:35:51.360 --> 2:35:55.360]  those you know bait-and-switch type companies that you're gonna call us would
[2:35:55.360 --> 2:35:59.080]  take money from you we want to hear your situation and so we will tell you
[2:35:59.080 --> 2:36:05.480]  exactly after hearing your situation what our individual solution for you
[2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:09.240]  tailored for you will be and then at that point you can decide whether or not
[2:36:09.240 --> 2:36:12.800]  you want to work with us or not well here's my frustration listeners know
[2:36:12.800 --> 2:36:16.960]  that I'll improve stuff I believe in and I'm up here like it's a lottery ticket
[2:36:16.960 --> 2:36:22.360]  saying learn about taxes save money you don't go to normal CPAs or normal lawyers
[2:36:22.360 --> 2:36:26.200]  or normal HR blog and get this that's right I would not be on air now if I
[2:36:26.200 --> 2:36:28.960]  hadn't gone out and gotten tax lawyers that knew this stuff and I paid way more
[2:36:28.960 --> 2:36:32.400]  than I should have this guy would have just instantly given us a prognosis to
[2:36:32.400 --> 2:36:35.240]  know what to do that's what I'd learned about your company learn to have some
[2:36:35.240 --> 2:36:38.280]  family use you guys you just already know all the stuff you look at it you have a
[2:36:38.280 --> 2:36:41.480]  quick answer and it's not a bunch of money it's like part of what they say I
[2:36:41.480 --> 2:36:45.760]  mean that is what we need absolutely Alex well it wouldn't make sense if what it
[2:36:45.760 --> 2:36:50.480]  cost was more than you would save in taxes right so obviously everyone needs
[2:36:50.480 --> 2:36:55.360]  to make money that's what it's about and so what you were speaking about you're
[2:36:55.360 --> 2:36:59.840]  alluding to is tax planning these people start businesses and I get it when you
[2:36:59.840 --> 2:37:03.360]  start a business all you're really concerned about is the bottom line and
[2:37:03.360 --> 2:37:07.240]  making sure you have revenue and that kind of thing but at the end but you
[2:37:07.240 --> 2:37:13.400]  need to make sure you have a succinct tax plan in in in a process here so that
[2:37:13.400 --> 2:37:18.080]  when you do make that revenue when you do make that profit you don't have to
[2:37:18.080 --> 2:37:23.000]  give it all back to the state and the IRS now I want to talk about state taxes
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:27.320]  for a bit you guys are good out here in Texas no income tax but keep in mind in
[2:37:27.320 --> 2:37:33.240]  the states that don't have income tax they are a lot harder in collecting the
[2:37:33.240 --> 2:37:39.160]  other types of taxes that they do levy so keep that in mind but where I am from
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:45.880]  in California highest income tax in the 50 states hit California in New York and
[2:37:45.880 --> 2:37:49.640]  so you know a large chunk of the population lives in these two states if
[2:37:49.640 --> 2:37:54.640]  you do like me listen I understand your pain and I can help you pay the least
[2:37:54.640 --> 2:38:02.680]  amount of state taxes as possible okay so let's talk about tax audits okay
[2:38:02.680 --> 2:38:09.880]  listen if the globalists the IRS the 60,000 agents that they just hired
[2:38:09.880 --> 2:38:16.360]  disagree with your numbers then they're gonna audit you right and that sounds
[2:38:16.360 --> 2:38:20.360]  like a really scary word but it's only scary if you don't have the right
[2:38:20.360 --> 2:38:25.680]  representation in your corner meaning a tax attorney a professional that can
[2:38:25.680 --> 2:38:29.920]  help you out or you actually do have something to hide well most Americans
[2:38:29.920 --> 2:38:34.440]  that get audited don't actually have anything to hide but they don't take the
[2:38:34.440 --> 2:38:38.320]  time because they don't know because I think hey I didn't do anything wrong but
[2:38:38.320 --> 2:38:43.600]  I really need the representation of an attorney and you do because when you get
[2:38:43.600 --> 2:38:51.960]  audited unless you know what to accept and deny from the assessment that you
[2:38:51.960 --> 2:38:56.360]  receive the IRS and the state dollars to doughnuts are going to charge you more
[2:38:56.360 --> 2:39:02.600]  than you actually even oh and so unless you have an advocate in your in your
[2:39:02.600 --> 2:39:08.200]  corner to go back to them and say listen you're we looked at this audit we were
[2:39:08.200 --> 2:39:11.560]  wrong about this number we're right about this number but this number is
[2:39:11.560 --> 2:39:15.480]  completely in left field we're not going to accept it they will assess that to
[2:39:15.480 --> 2:39:20.800]  you and listen if that's already happened to you give us a call we can help
[2:39:20.800 --> 2:39:25.000]  it out here's the thing about audits right audits are kind of like treating
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:31.520]  cancer treat cancer this soon as possible so the sooner you get there the
[2:39:31.520 --> 2:39:34.760]  more easily treatable it is it doesn't mean that it's not treatable just because
[2:39:34.760 --> 2:39:39.120]  you got to it late but it makes it a little bit more work so that means if
[2:39:39.120 --> 2:39:42.480]  you get an assessment letter you get an audit letter from the IRS or the state
[2:39:42.480 --> 2:39:46.160]  you need to give us a call right now and we'll put that to bed before that
[2:39:46.160 --> 2:39:50.440]  assessment gets levied on to your tax account and I want to be one trillion
[2:39:50.440 --> 2:39:55.760]  percent clear here Tyler because yes I'm infomercialing to make money because our
[2:39:55.760 --> 2:39:59.080]  regular sales won't pay the bills because the supply chain breakdowns or
[2:39:59.080 --> 2:40:01.600]  that half our supplements have been discontinued as we didn't lower the
[2:40:01.600 --> 2:40:06.280]  quality everything's made in China we won't do it so we're in trouble so I go
[2:40:06.280 --> 2:40:10.280]  out and I think who do I know people already use who's already highly rated
[2:40:10.280 --> 2:40:15.560]  wait wait people I know have used a tax company American tax solutions and I
[2:40:15.560 --> 2:40:20.480]  call the guys a listener it's like a month and a half ago two months ago I

[2:40:26.680 --> 2:40:32.320]  over but it's not my opinion basic hour-long consultation will save you
[2:40:32.320 --> 2:40:37.440]  across the board it's written to screw you it's like picking up gold bars off
[2:40:37.440 --> 2:40:44.000]  the freaking beach Apple pays no taxes Amazon pays no taxes they all because
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:49.400]  they know this stuff and they act like it's all magic no you don't have a
[2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:53.480]  company that will give you the codes to punch it in and put their name on it so
[2:40:53.480 --> 2:40:57.840]  they'll defend it and this is one of the most empowering things we can do we're
[2:40:57.840 --> 2:41:00.840]  not gonna rob people for a revolution we're not gonna sell crack for a
[2:41:00.840 --> 2:41:04.640]  revolution we're not gonna do our founding fathers robbed people to get

[2:41:08.400 --> 2:41:12.800]  code with lawyers and not pay most of it and then we get part of the money I
[2:41:12.800 --> 2:41:17.600]  stay on air you get successful they get successful and we all win that's right
[2:41:17.600 --> 2:41:21.000]  Alex and we're paying the least amount to the regime in the globalist that we
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:25.200]  don't support you don't listen I've talked to top senators top everybody and

[2:47:09.760 --> 2:47:16.480]  there are two sayings in americana that are over 150 years old no one knows who
[2:47:16.480 --> 2:47:21.440]  first said them but everybody knows they're true because they ring true you
[2:47:21.440 --> 2:47:28.760]  can eat a horse to water but you can't make it drink and you don't look at gift
[2:47:28.760 --> 2:47:32.640]  horse in the mouth you know horse traders would look at the teeth of a
[2:47:32.640 --> 2:47:35.960]  horse and see how much time they had left because after a horse can't eat its
[2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:40.280]  its oats and its food it gets sick and dies that's like on elephants or any other
[2:47:40.280 --> 2:47:44.800]  animal the teeth are the lungs you have any of the creature so you don't look at
[2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:50.840]  gift horse in the mouth and you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it
[2:47:50.840 --> 2:47:55.520]  drink and folks I love you to death but there's nothing that pisses me off more
[2:47:55.520 --> 2:47:59.120]  than knowing we got probably three million people watching one way or another
[2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:03.160]  right now and that less than one percent are gonna call and do this it funds us
[2:48:03.160 --> 2:48:08.960]  it funds him it funds you because they are screwing you and if you just call
[2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:12.640]  and do a prospectus and let them know under attorney client privilege they
[2:48:12.640 --> 2:48:15.680]  will tell you whether you're a blue-collar worker in a factory whether
[2:48:15.680 --> 2:48:20.160]  you're a doctor a scientist a billionaire you need to know these tactics or

[2:49:00.440 --> 2:49:07.120]  negotiation if I climbed in there in the in the octagon with even 150 pound top
[2:49:07.120 --> 2:49:09.720]  fighter I get my ass kicked because I don't know what they're gonna do doesn't
[2:49:09.720 --> 2:49:13.880]  matter I weighed 270 pounds that matter I've fought and won some fights these
[2:49:13.880 --> 2:49:17.600]  people are professionals they're gonna kick my ass it's the same thing you
[2:49:17.600 --> 2:49:22.800]  climb into the tax system and you don't have a real company you're done
[2:49:22.800 --> 2:49:28.720]  explain to them that's right Alex so the the IRS and the state collectively they
[2:49:28.720 --> 2:49:33.800]  are both that big bully in the in the ring and unless you have a fighter that's
[2:49:33.800 --> 2:49:37.680]  gonna go up against them if you're gonna get pummeled let me tell you you
[2:49:37.680 --> 2:49:40.480]  know the punches they're gonna throw you have to know the exactly the punches
[2:49:40.480 --> 2:49:44.920]  they're gonna throw and let me tell you some things we were able to do for
[2:49:44.920 --> 2:49:49.440]  example I had a client out in California who lost his job because he
[2:49:49.440 --> 2:49:53.320]  refused to drive his trunk while he was he had been drinking at a bar and his
[2:49:53.320 --> 2:49:57.360]  employer said you have to drive well he won a settlement from that suit in the
[2:49:57.360 --> 2:50:00.880]  state of California said hey that's taxable right and they were taxing
[2:50:00.880 --> 2:50:04.800]  40% of the settlement he made well that settlement's not taxable because he
[2:50:04.800 --> 2:50:11.880]  wanted under you know uh excuse me a rights violation yeah don't blame
[2:50:11.880 --> 2:50:16.200]  yourself for having real data and remember I'm similar give me the that's
[2:50:16.200 --> 2:50:18.560]  when people really know what they're doing that's in your brain not a
[2:50:18.560 --> 2:50:22.560]  teleprompter keep keep telling them the brain works faster than mouth so anyways
[2:50:22.560 --> 2:50:26.680]  so what had happened is I ended up writing to the California franchise
[2:50:26.680 --> 2:50:32.160]  tax board explaining to them this award was not taxable and you know this is how
[2:50:32.160 --> 2:50:36.240]  the government works they sent me three letters every month saying we're
[2:50:36.240 --> 2:50:40.640]  reviewing what you sent us that means it actually went up to legal and we're
[2:50:40.640 --> 2:50:43.960]  doing some good work and so when they finally you said piss up a rope that's
[2:50:43.960 --> 2:50:48.080]  exactly what we said we we've what we here's the law bitch that's right you
[2:50:48.080 --> 2:50:51.840]  be a bureaucrats don't run stuff we're sitting we know what's going down so we
[2:50:51.840 --> 2:50:56.840]  write a legal memo we include in it the relevant tax law and IRC that's the
[2:50:56.840 --> 2:51:01.280]  internal revenue code that pertains to the subject and they ended up giving my
[2:51:01.280 --> 2:51:07.200]  client $250,000 back that he had paid in all day long all day long all day long
[2:51:07.200 --> 2:51:11.720]  I could I could go on they have no respect for you if you don't know that's
[2:51:11.720 --> 2:51:15.640]  exactly right because you don't speak the language well it's like the DMV right
[2:51:15.640 --> 2:51:18.960]  if you ever go into the DMV and felt like you're not get like those people
[2:51:18.960 --> 2:51:22.160]  just kind of have it out for you they hate their job so they take it out on
[2:51:22.160 --> 2:51:27.480]  you listen these tax collectors are the same way they're mad and because they
[2:51:27.480 --> 2:51:32.080]  kind of got a shitty job and then they don't know the law they asked so if they
[2:51:32.080 --> 2:51:37.160]  break the law it's then up to the legal department at the IRS at the state to
[2:51:37.160 --> 2:51:41.760]  decide whether or not they broke it or not and if they broke it unless you have
[2:51:41.760 --> 2:51:45.600]  a tax attorney firm in your pocket to assert your rights they're just gonna
[2:51:45.600 --> 2:51:51.400]  say we're sorry you know whatever but the thing is is we're able to say no
[2:51:51.400 --> 2:51:55.760]  those rights that you had as an American as a taxpayer because as a taxpayer you
[2:51:55.760 --> 2:51:59.000]  have a bill of rights separate from the bill of rights meaning you have right
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:03.320]  to representation and you have right to pay not a penny more than you owe and so
[2:52:03.320 --> 2:52:06.120]  once we assert those rights for you that's when they'll start sending you
[2:52:06.120 --> 2:52:10.640]  back a refund if you have paid in wrong it's like magic when you know it they
[2:52:10.640 --> 2:52:14.400]  just it's like oh okay you're in the know it's like we're in the glasses and
[2:52:14.400 --> 2:52:18.320]  they live but if you don't have the glasses you're screwed absolutely and
[2:52:18.320 --> 2:52:22.080]  especially in this post pair if you still want to call it continuing
[2:52:22.080 --> 2:52:28.880]  pandemic economy that we live in now the IRS has really used the hullabaloo to
[2:52:28.880 --> 2:52:33.960]  their advantage words very hard it was hard before for the lay person to get
[2:52:33.960 --> 2:52:37.440]  through and get any information out of them now it's damn near impossible and
[2:52:37.440 --> 2:52:42.600]  so if you're calling an organization that's charging you money and you can't
[2:52:42.600 --> 2:52:47.000]  get through them to figure out even why or what you owe that's an issue right so
[2:52:47.000 --> 2:52:51.040]  give us a call we have a fast-track line to the IRS and the state we'll get
[2:52:51.040 --> 2:52:53.480]  through immediately we'll figure out what the problem is we'll solve it for
[2:52:53.480 --> 2:52:57.320]  you right then and there again there's a lot of types of businesses in law and
[2:52:57.320 --> 2:53:01.520]  in the taxes really you know kind of establishment companies are slow and
[2:53:01.520 --> 2:53:05.560]  weird but do their job but charge you three times more scam companies to charge
[2:53:05.560 --> 2:53:08.960]  you five times more and drag it out and then real companies it's just cut to the
[2:53:08.960 --> 2:53:12.680]  chase and get it done that's exactly right and I do want to mention that you
[2:53:12.680 --> 2:53:17.000]  know of the plethora of tax issues as I said there was a past the president in
[2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:22.240]  the future right a lot of these things take a different time period of of legal
[2:53:22.240 --> 2:53:26.400]  work that our professionals have to put in to get done but that's some of the
[2:53:26.400 --> 2:53:30.920]  stuff's complex but for most people it's very simple for most people it is as
[2:53:30.920 --> 2:53:35.560]  simple as asserting the rights of which they did not know they're like oh you
[2:53:35.560 --> 2:53:39.320]  got a settlement that's not taxable exactly right little little you have the
[2:53:39.320 --> 2:53:43.960]  basics like 90% of its screw jobs and there's more complex stuff here Alex you
[2:53:43.960 --> 2:53:48.920]  be surprised how many people come to me and say hey I won this settlement for
[2:53:48.920 --> 2:53:54.240]  civil rights or for I was injured on the job and the IRS and the state are
[2:53:54.240 --> 2:53:58.840]  taxing them and it's it's in IRC one that that is not that the first and that's
[2:53:58.840 --> 2:54:02.280]  one of the tricks you've got you got thousands we got thousands that's just
[2:54:02.280 --> 2:54:06.760]  the reading the actual code believe it or not and applying what the actual code
[2:54:06.760 --> 2:54:13.000]  says is half of the job because they don't even the IRS goes off what's
[2:54:13.000 --> 2:54:17.120]  called the internal revenue manual the IRM look it up what it is it's based on
[2:54:17.120 --> 2:54:22.320]  the IRC but it's interpreted opinion works its opinion interpreted by
[2:54:22.320 --> 2:54:26.920]  clerks not actual attorneys was like a judge you said Trump is guilty of
[2:54:26.920 --> 2:54:30.680]  January 6 the criminal no trial happened but it's his opinion that's
[2:54:30.680 --> 2:54:34.640]  exactly right and so but the thing is is the opinion of these revenue officers
[2:54:34.640 --> 2:54:39.640]  becomes the word of law that's why I get so frustrated folks everything I push
[2:54:39.640 --> 2:54:44.520]  is good I love it it's it's wonderful it funds us it's good for you this of

[2:55:59.520 --> 2:56:05.080]  avoid what's called double taxation which is this idea invented by the globalist
[2:56:05.080 --> 2:56:09.880]  to scare you away from the number one beneficial corporation which is a C
[2:56:09.880 --> 2:56:13.640]  Corp. Oh it has double taxation that is the easiest thing to get around if you

[2:57:20.760 --> 2:57:24.680]  said is that the average tax lawyer of the average CPA won't tell you this
[2:57:24.680 --> 2:57:29.160]  stuff this is all real they sign off it's certified it's on them and it is
[2:57:29.160 --> 2:57:35.640]  just a goldmine a platinum mind a uranium mine of freedom and it's the
[2:57:35.640 --> 2:57:38.480]  biggest thing that people need to learn everything we do is about exposing the
[2:57:38.480 --> 2:57:42.200]  globalist everything do is exposing their secrets how they operate that's
[2:57:42.200 --> 2:57:45.440]  why we're doing this thank you so much absolutely we've saved the people 20
[2:57:45.440 --> 2:57:51.080]  million dollars it's about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand in for worse I've
[2:57:51.080 --> 2:57:55.040]  been on the air a couple years but I only had money to finance my own simple
[2:57:55.040 --> 2:57:58.640]  little local radio show I wanted to hire camera people I wanted to make films I
[2:57:58.640 --> 2:58:02.640]  wanted to really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt I designed the first
[2:58:02.640 --> 2:58:08.080]  one mass murderers agreed gun control works that helped us finance hiring the
[2:58:08.080 --> 2:58:12.240]  first two members of my crew that's our oldest design and we still sell it we
[2:58:12.240 --> 2:58:16.000]  have that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions
[2:58:16.000 --> 2:58:20.320]  because whatever stuff we've got in that's it we're selling everything out
[2:58:20.320 --> 2:58:24.000]  to find the operation to get rid of inventory we'll still have some
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:27.640]  teachers in the future they'll just be limited editions and short runs so if you
[2:58:27.640 --> 2:58:31.240]  want to get any of these historic shirts this is your last chance on almost

[2:58:58.040 --> 2:59:02.080]  born for this and people are really waking up right now but we had to build
[2:59:02.080 --> 2:59:06.680]  our own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost
[2:59:06.680 --> 2:59:10.600]  tens of millions of dollars and now with Bandot video getting close to 10
[2:59:10.600 --> 2:59:15.200]  million views a day we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists
[2:59:15.200 --> 2:59:20.600]  and groups to be able to post their content free of charge and because it's
[2:59:20.600 --> 2:59:26.440]  become so successful it's a catch-22 info wars and Bandot video have become a
[2:59:26.440 --> 2:59:30.560]  mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide but the
[2:59:30.560 --> 2:59:35.360]  expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter hundreds and
[2:59:35.360 --> 2:59:38.840]  hundreds of thousands of dollars a month so the biggest sale in inforce
[2:59:38.840 --> 2:59:43.120]  history is going right now the mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off
[2:59:43.120 --> 2:59:48.280]  getting credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever
[2:59:48.280 --> 3:00:06.400]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:00:19.240 --> 3:00:26.800]  we are here talking about the tax code and fraud there's an article don't
[3:00:26.800 --> 3:00:33.000]  forget crowdfunding cryptocurrency and gig-dollar taxes and we got Tyler
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:36.680]  Bennett of American tax solutions Jones tax relief breaking this down give us
[3:00:36.680 --> 3:00:40.360]  the latest all right Alex here's the thing about because this is a direct
[3:00:40.360 --> 3:00:46.120]  attack on the middle class right so I the Biden administration has passed a law
[3:00:46.120 --> 3:00:53.080]  that says any of these intermediary cash companies such as PayPal such as Venmo
[3:00:53.080 --> 3:00:59.560]  such as Zell including restyle sites such as eBay Etsy the like the old rules
[3:00:59.560 --> 3:01:03.040]  used to be you could sell anything on those things or give money back and
[3:01:03.040 --> 3:01:06.880]  forth and before you reach a certain dollar threshold or number of
[3:01:06.880 --> 3:01:11.200]  transactions you wouldn't be considered to be in a business well the by
[3:01:11.200 --> 3:01:15.560]  administration has changed that around now if you make one sale or a number of
[3:01:15.560 --> 3:01:20.320]  sales in it and it ends up being over six hundred and fifty dollars you now fit
[3:01:20.320 --> 3:01:25.200]  the requirements to be 1099 Kade which is a merchant so they're killing the
[3:01:25.200 --> 3:01:30.680]  underground economy they're killing the underground economy in favor of giving
[3:01:30.680 --> 3:01:36.360]  their super wealthy tax breaks right so there's this thing called the tax gap
[3:01:36.360 --> 3:01:39.800]  that tax strategies have talked about for a long time which is the difference
[3:01:39.800 --> 3:01:43.880]  between how much the IRS actually makes every year and how much they need to make
[3:01:43.880 --> 3:01:48.320]  to cover the deficit right every year and there's about a trillion and a half
[3:01:48.320 --> 3:01:55.680]  dollars gap every difference every year and the thing is this is if we tax the
[3:01:55.680 --> 3:01:59.120]  globalist if they paid their fair share not even their fair share it's just a
[3:01:59.120 --> 3:02:03.160]  percentage of their fair share that would go away and it would actually be in
[3:02:03.160 --> 3:02:07.680]  surplus but instead the White House wants to attack the middle class and so
[3:02:07.680 --> 3:02:11.240]  they're saying we'll close the tax gap because all these middle class people
[3:02:11.240 --> 3:02:17.480]  aren't reporting a $600 shoe sale here you know a $300 this sale there a
[3:02:17.480 --> 3:02:21.880]  garage sale there so they want to make sure they're screwing you over so that
[3:02:21.880 --> 3:02:26.320]  they can get by paying the least amount of taxes and that's why I feel so good
[3:02:26.320 --> 3:02:31.160]  about this like nothing makes me feel better than having a gun sponsor because
[3:02:31.160 --> 3:02:34.560]  I know some people low percentage will do something wrong but it's good people
[3:02:34.560 --> 3:02:38.000]  are gonna get it nine I percent of the time protect themselves or selling a
[3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:41.080]  water filter that cleans out all the taxes in the water they admit are there
[3:02:41.080 --> 3:02:45.560]  or selling like a supplement like vitamin D3 during a pandemic that we know
[3:02:45.560 --> 3:02:51.760]  really massively reduces the chance of getting sick or dying and with this
[3:02:51.760 --> 3:02:55.840]  though it's like so known that our tax codes a scam for rich people to not pay
[3:02:55.840 --> 3:02:59.080]  and we got one of the best tax firms out there this is just something everybody
[3:02:59.080 --> 3:03:02.440]  should call your people are really friendly and they'll they'll whether
[3:03:02.440 --> 3:03:05.880]  you're a regular blue-collar worker or some rich person you guys have some real
[3:03:05.880 --> 3:03:10.600]  services absolutely and let me just make a comment on that because you're right
[3:03:10.600 --> 3:03:16.240]  Alex is the two things that allow a government a state to take absolute
[3:03:16.240 --> 3:03:20.200]  control of the nation is disarming them taking their weapons and taking their
[3:03:20.200 --> 3:03:23.040]  money taking their money and they've already tried to guns take the money
[3:03:23.040 --> 3:03:26.040]  take their land and now they're taking your money and your land and everything
[3:03:26.040 --> 3:03:29.520]  else and like Charles Schwab said you care Klaus Schwab excuse me you'll own
[3:03:29.520 --> 3:03:34.240]  nothing happy you'll own nothing and everything yeah Tyler Bennett you are

[3:06:56.560 --> 3:07:01.960]  know they do great work Mr. Lorie over there and he came out with an article
[3:07:01.960 --> 3:07:07.600]  about how that train station incident over there in Ukraine the Russians
[3:07:07.600 --> 3:07:12.240]  claim they didn't do it and now they're getting threatened to be pushed off
[3:07:12.240 --> 3:07:19.440]  Facebook for writing an article that questions the narrative being shoved
[3:07:19.440 --> 3:07:28.400]  down our throats by the criminal gang yeah this goes way back remember the
[3:07:28.400 --> 3:07:36.920]  main there he is Joe Lorie he's a great guy and you're seeing what's going on
[3:07:36.920 --> 3:07:41.480]  and this again this is why you have to support the truth because they're gonna
[3:07:41.480 --> 3:07:46.760]  rob it from us I'm a trend forecaster I've been at this for 42 years that's
[3:07:46.760 --> 3:07:51.960]  selling books trends 2000 trend tracking far better than megatrends time

[3:08:04.760 --> 3:08:10.680]  forecast and then we could start to talk I'm only mentioning this because I'm a
[3:08:10.680 --> 3:08:21.000]  visionary I look ahead World War three has begun if we do not unite for peace we
[3:08:21.000 --> 3:08:29.400]  are going to die for war I even had a nightmare about this like Friday night
[3:08:29.400 --> 3:08:35.560]  and it was like a famous person but I don't know who was like an RFK or JFK
[3:08:35.560 --> 3:08:41.040]  somebody from the past and it was in an auditorium and he said World War three
[3:08:41.040 --> 3:08:46.640]  began and the rest of the audience just ignored it and I you know I raised my
[3:08:46.640 --> 3:08:53.560]  hand I said sorry I said you know I've been forecasting this and then the topic
[3:08:53.560 --> 3:09:05.080]  changed again Americans have no idea what a real war is like take a look at
[3:09:05.080 --> 3:09:12.280]  Dresden isn't it lovely after bombed out by the British killing all those
[3:09:12.280 --> 3:09:19.320]  innocent people in World War two Berlin as I said was grander than Paris
[3:09:19.320 --> 3:09:30.280]  before was destroyed this is an ancient history World War three has begun the
[3:09:30.280 --> 3:09:36.520]  hatred that's going on in teaching us how to hate all Russians hey you know how
[3:09:36.520 --> 3:09:40.560]  to ice skate you know how to play soccer you know how to do this you're Russian
[3:09:40.560 --> 3:09:51.960]  you can't play anymore yep Dresden nightmare one after another which we
[3:09:51.960 --> 3:09:56.000]  were right we're hating the Russian people and I love that I love the line
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:10:01.600]  that that Levi's is pulling out of Russia 2% of their business comes from
[3:10:01.600 --> 3:10:05.520]  Russia what are you pulling out for it's great that you are what are you selling
[3:10:05.520 --> 3:10:11.960]  dungarees oh no salinity those are blue jeans and it shows you how low the world
[3:10:11.960 --> 3:10:17.760]  is gone they used to have dungarees that Levi Strauss invented in the 1850s when
[3:10:17.760 --> 3:10:23.080]  they were mining gold out of California and they needed some you know crummy rough
[3:10:23.080 --> 3:10:30.720]  wear to wear so wouldn't rep and that's become the style so what I'm saying is
[3:10:30.720 --> 3:10:37.520]  that you need to support info wars because they are going to take us to war
[3:10:37.520 --> 3:10:44.000]  and you will not hear any other narrative other than the crap that they're
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:53.040]  shoving down our with throat you look at the faces of these guys that are the
[3:10:53.040 --> 3:11:02.320]  mouthpieces this guy Sullivan Jake Sullivan was the security advisor is

[3:15:50.520 --> 3:15:52.920]  right back
[3:15:53.520 --> 3:15:57.600]  Mike in California thanks for calling I think we're barking up the wrong tree
[3:15:57.600 --> 3:16:02.480]  calling this gain of function research now if you read the actual you know 2014
[3:16:02.480 --> 3:16:06.560]  legislation the US government gain of function deliberative process and
[3:16:06.560 --> 3:16:10.920]  research funding pause on selected gain of function research involving
[3:16:10.920 --> 3:16:15.240]  influence of MERS and stars viruses there's nothing about stars like viruses
[3:16:15.240 --> 3:16:19.520]  and it's a research funding pause it's not a stop it's not a prohibition it's
[3:16:19.520 --> 3:16:23.040]  when you come to a four-way intersection there's the stops on you stop you look
[3:16:23.040 --> 3:16:27.080]  both ways and then you proceed and so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of
[3:16:27.080 --> 3:16:30.920]  function just selected gain of function but they'll argue that this is actually
[3:16:30.920 --> 3:16:35.600]  characterization and qualification research so you know Rand and others you
[3:16:35.600 --> 3:16:38.120]  know maybe Fauci was right they don't quite know what they're talking about
[3:16:38.120 --> 3:16:41.040]  calling it gain of function you know that's why he didn't perjure himself
[3:16:41.040 --> 3:16:44.080]  that's why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating new
[3:16:44.080 --> 3:16:48.040]  synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do but in the main definition
[3:16:48.040 --> 3:16:51.520]  it's still a gain of function you're making something deadly that spreads
[3:16:51.520 --> 3:16:55.320]  more easily to hurt people thank you Mike we love you ladies and gentlemen I

[3:50:20.040 --> 3:50:25.880]  War two and the Russians are the first to defeat the Germans Napoleon I
[3:50:25.880 --> 3:50:31.520]  mentioned this over and over again March to Moscow leaving Poland in 1812 with

[3:51:00.400 --> 3:51:06.040]  on your calendar at the most historic four corners in America that I own three
[3:51:06.040 --> 3:51:10.640]  of the buildings and this one is in that yard where you saw the that that shot
[3:51:10.640 --> 3:51:21.000]  from the the church behind the Franz Rogan house and the 1750s front of
[3:51:21.000 --> 3:51:25.560]  Rogan house I bought these buildings because the seeds of democracy was sown
[3:51:25.560 --> 3:51:30.400]  here and this is the four corners of freedom if we don't unite for peace we're
[3:51:30.400 --> 3:51:35.520]  finished look at the clowns we got running the show look at the clowns
[3:51:35.520 --> 3:51:42.800]  they talk about the atrocities how about that guy Harry Truman yeah not
[3:51:42.800 --> 3:51:54.360]  kisaki Fukushima bombs away the clowns clown show cartoon news network now
[3:51:54.360 --> 3:52:03.240]  we're in we're in a crisis so the NASDAQ is down 2% Dow was down about 359
[3:52:03.240 --> 3:52:09.320]  points when I left the NASDAQ is down 1.57 they say it's going to be stag
[3:52:09.320 --> 3:52:17.160]  flation it's not it's gonna be drag flation inflation is gonna continue to
[3:52:17.160 --> 3:52:24.600]  skyrocket and the economy is going to drag down when these interest rates go
[3:52:24.600 --> 3:52:28.080]  up and they're saying how aggressive the Fed is going to be in raising interest
[3:52:28.080 --> 3:52:35.160]  rates what aggressive they raise them 50 basis points when you got inflation
[3:52:35.160 --> 3:52:43.240]  running at 7.9% and the IMF says that your interest rate should be 1% over
[3:52:43.240 --> 3:52:50.320]  the inflation rate which means that our real interest rate should be 8.9% not
[3:52:50.320 --> 3:53:03.120]  0.25% and if it goes up 50 basis points 0.75% nothing but even these rates
[3:53:03.120 --> 3:53:08.560]  increases the economy can't take it because of all the cheap money that
[3:53:08.560 --> 3:53:14.400]  they artificially pumped into the market during the COVID lockdown bringing
[3:53:14.400 --> 3:53:21.120]  interest rates down to zero negative interest rates in the UK excuse me in
[3:53:21.120 --> 3:53:28.840]  Europe where your inflation rate is 7.5% and they have a minus zero minus
[3:53:28.840 --> 3:53:39.440]  0.5 0% interest rate all right you got it you know me GCs 3 Gs guns gold in a
[3:53:39.440 --> 3:53:47.720]  getaway plan and the silver coins the 1776 silver coins are real currencies
[3:53:47.720 --> 3:53:57.320]  that you get from info wars store.com so again you know the motto of the
[3:53:57.320 --> 3:54:04.760]  trends journals think for yourself and they're just pumping more cheap dough
[3:54:04.760 --> 3:54:10.920]  into this thing to artificially prop it up this thing's gonna crash big time we
[3:54:10.920 --> 3:54:16.320]  are gonna go into the worst economic calamity in modern history just as we
[3:54:16.320 --> 3:54:23.240]  went into the worst calamity in written history with the lockdowns in a country
[3:54:23.240 --> 3:54:34.120]  near you to fight the COVID of which again according to the CDC 94% of the
