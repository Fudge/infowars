[00:00.000 --> 00:24.920]  All you have to do is check out what I'm saying, and that's why they run the fake headline
[00:24.920 --> 00:32.320]  against myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere, every day. Jones admits he's an actor, or
[00:32.320 --> 00:37.800]  Tucker Carlson says nobody would take me seriously. Where do we say that? We never said that.
[00:37.800 --> 00:44.040]  They just say we said that. But where's the clip? Where's the article? Where do we say
[00:44.040 --> 00:45.920]  that? It doesn't exist.
[00:45.920 --> 00:50.320]  Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist.
[00:50.320 --> 00:53.440]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show.
[00:53.440 --> 00:58.040]  The radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act.
[00:58.040 --> 01:03.640]  He's actually a performance artist. He's a performance artist. Alex Jones is a fake.
[01:03.640 --> 01:10.240]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid, and it's all based on custody battle
[01:10.240 --> 01:14.280]  with my ex-wife five years ago, and she was trying to put into evidence of me dressed
[01:14.280 --> 01:19.960]  up more than a decade before, like the Joker, being sarcastic saying take your Prozac kids,
[01:19.960 --> 01:26.080]  take your illegal drugs too, you'll die, it's fun, so people wouldn't take drugs. And they
[01:26.080 --> 01:30.080]  wanted to enter that in evidence. They look, he's insane, telling kids to use drugs, and
[01:30.080 --> 01:35.200]  my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks that's
[01:35.200 --> 01:43.640]  really Jack Nicholson. So yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander, or Optimus Prime, or
[01:43.640 --> 01:55.560]  the Joker, because I can do imitations of them all really good, or Darth Vader. Do I really
[01:55.560 --> 02:00.720]  think I'm Darth Vader? No. Do I think I'm Optimus Prime, Cobra Commander, the Joker?
[02:00.720 --> 02:06.720]  No. And clearly, no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire that what I'm
[02:06.720 --> 02:11.760]  saying is what I really think. No one believes the Babylon Bee. It's not trying to lie to
[02:11.760 --> 02:17.680]  you, it's being sarcastic. By the Vaccinate Meow Modal today. It's required by the CDC.
[02:17.680 --> 02:22.760]  But they play those games. And that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to.
[02:22.760 --> 02:27.400]  Even though I tell people, okay, this is a joke, this isn't serious, they clip it out,
[02:27.400 --> 02:33.880]  and they say, no, this is what he really believes. Every day when I leave work, I do this. That
[02:33.880 --> 02:37.600]  man's threatened this country. And they go, look, he admitted in court, he's an actor.
[02:37.600 --> 02:43.640]  Well, yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly. I was an actor in Waking Life. I was an actor
[02:43.640 --> 02:50.720]  when I was Cobra Commander. But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host,
[02:50.720 --> 02:55.320]  up here reading news articles to you, isn't a real thing, and isn't something I'm actually
[02:55.320 --> 02:59.480]  saying. And you know that. You're insulted right now, I'm even explaining that to you.
[02:59.480 --> 03:09.000]  And so am I. But that's who these people are. You don't know the power of the dark side.
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.520]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[03:11.520 --> 03:17.120]  Nick Alex Jones seems really talented. He's smart. He's funny as hell. He's truly funny.
[03:17.120 --> 03:18.960]  I'm kind of retarded.
[03:18.960 --> 03:32.560]  Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes, do you now not listen to what
[03:32.560 --> 03:37.520]  I say about other things when I show you a powerful news article by Dr. Joseph Mercola
[03:37.520 --> 03:43.560]  on infowars.com that has all the cited information, the latest tragedy sudden adult death syndrome?
[03:43.560 --> 03:49.720]  No, that's a real thing. That's something happening in the real world. And that's what
[03:49.720 --> 03:55.320]  we're breaking down here today. I am Alex Jones. And I am the guy on this show every
[03:55.320 --> 04:01.760]  day. I am an American. And that's what I promote is freedom and justice and liberty and they
[04:01.760 --> 04:13.480]  can't stand it.
[04:13.480 --> 04:31.520]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's
[04:31.520 --> 04:35.840]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got
[04:35.840 --> 04:36.840]  one.
[04:36.840 --> 05:01.320]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[05:01.320 --> 05:12.400]  What is ultimate mean? That's just our name for the best, the highest grade. What this
[05:12.400 --> 05:19.160]  concentrated and show the oil pure Arctic krill oil and high quality wild caught salmon
[05:19.160 --> 05:26.280]  oil does for your brain, your heart, your cardiovascular system and for your entire body's functions
[05:26.280 --> 05:33.440]  is insane. Regular low grade fish oil in all the studies does outstanding things. This
[05:33.440 --> 05:39.120]  is the highest grade and it's not been pasteurized. It's not been boiled. So it has its original
[05:39.120 --> 05:45.360]  effects intact. Ladies and gentlemen, everybody should visit infowarstore.com today and get

[06:16.800 --> 06:21.560]  Alex Jones show. I am Harrison Smith sitting in for Alex, but not really actually just
[06:21.560 --> 06:25.600]  be here for the first hour really just setting up what you're about to see. This is an interview
[06:25.600 --> 06:31.400]  that Alex Jones had with Steve Bannon yesterday on Steve Bannon show, the war room pandemic
[06:31.400 --> 06:35.040]  and it's an extensive interview about an hour long. We're going to fill up the first hour
[06:35.040 --> 06:39.320]  with it where they talk about all sorts of topics, but primarily transhumanism, which
[06:39.320 --> 06:44.040]  of course you can find all about in the great reset and the war for the world, the new book
[06:44.040 --> 06:49.640]  by Alex Jones. So without any further ado, here it is the interview from yesterday with
[06:49.640 --> 06:55.120]  Steve Bannon and Alex Jones. Let's watch the next 71 days. We're going to see some very
[06:55.120 --> 07:05.880]  violent fireworks. I would predict racially motivated mass shootings, bombings, poisonings,
[07:05.880 --> 07:11.200]  attacks on power supplies being blamed on the right wing. They intend to bring in a full
[07:11.200 --> 07:18.160]  dictatorship in the next 71 days and we are all strapped to this thing. This is such a
[07:18.160 --> 07:24.200]  dangerous time and I would advise the globalist who are mid-level that think they're about
[07:24.200 --> 07:27.880]  to have a leftist revolution. The globalists don't actually plan at the higher levels to
[07:27.880 --> 07:31.960]  have that. They plan on having a civil war that brings down America and you'll be the
[07:31.960 --> 07:33.440]  fall guy.
[07:33.440 --> 07:39.320]  Okay, welcome back. We got Alex Jones. The release of the book is today. The great reset
[07:39.320 --> 07:44.240]  and the war for the world. It's a blockbuster. Everybody's got to get it, but I want to get
[07:44.240 --> 07:49.640]  in first. Alex, these comments yesterday, let's talk about them for a second because
[07:49.640 --> 07:57.400]  it's got everybody, obviously, their heads blowing up. We've got now 70 days to go.
[07:57.400 --> 08:00.760]  We've got momentum. They're trying to suppress it with suppression polls. They're sitting
[08:00.760 --> 08:04.640]  there going, you know, you guys are not going to have a writ tsunami.
[08:04.640 --> 08:09.080]  What is your theory of the case here? Because you're a smart guy. Do you really believe
[08:09.080 --> 08:13.520]  that they're going to try to pull out all stops in this regard or does that hurt us
[08:13.520 --> 08:17.120]  playing into that narrative? Walk us through, because I know you're trying to accomplish
[08:17.120 --> 08:21.360]  exactly what we're trying to accomplish, which is to take the country back and to make sure
[08:21.360 --> 08:25.680]  we do the House and the Senate and then we get, I don't know if Trump back in or not.
[08:25.680 --> 08:30.120]  I know that you've got some very definitive thoughts about that, but we've got to win
[08:30.120 --> 08:32.880]  the House. We've got to win the Senate. We have to win these school boards. We have to
[08:32.880 --> 08:36.640]  win these state legislatures. So walk us through your theory of the case because we only got
[08:36.640 --> 08:39.360]  a 40-second clip on you from yesterday.
[08:39.360 --> 08:44.560]  And I apologize. I know you requested a full clip. I've spent basically an hour on that
[08:44.560 --> 08:50.760]  in my third hour yesterday. In context, I said that is something that is in their deck
[08:50.760 --> 08:55.240]  of cards. It's the race of spades. It's a provocateur, a false flag attack or something
[08:55.240 --> 09:02.000]  like we saw with the staged Whitmer kidnapping situation a few years ago with the same FBI
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.720]  group then going and running the provocaturing on January 6th, the same FBI group running
[09:06.720 --> 09:14.440]  the fake Russian dossier and the same special FBI unit now raiding Marlago a few weeks ago.
[09:14.440 --> 09:21.440]  So we see the pre-programming of puppet Biden, the third administration of Obama, in June
[09:21.440 --> 09:28.600]  of last year putting out a new National Terrorism Directive saying questioning election fraud,
[09:28.600 --> 09:35.800]  questioning election results or questioning lockdowns or forced inoculation is terrorism
[09:35.800 --> 09:40.400]  or questioning critical race theory. That's officially in that national plan. And then
[09:40.400 --> 09:44.240]  we've seen them roll that out. We've seen the FBI say the number one terror threat is
[09:44.240 --> 09:49.480]  domestic right wingers. They've now defined it as fascism. If you support President Trump
[09:49.480 --> 09:54.600]  or America first, and then now we start seeing headlines in the top of drugs yesterday, imminent
[09:54.600 --> 10:00.800]  Trump's calling for violence, Trump's calling for insurrection, January 6th, 2.0. That's
[10:00.800 --> 10:09.400]  been all over the news. Building up and Biden came out on Friday and said, I believe that
[10:09.400 --> 10:14.240]  Republicans are going to be violent in the next 74 days. Well, now yesterday was 71
[10:14.240 --> 10:20.160]  days. Now we're 70 days out. And if you look at all the pre-programming data points that
[10:20.160 --> 10:26.240]  are there, they're hyping this up. And with their long history of Sir Hand, Sir Hand being
[10:26.240 --> 10:32.000]  a Patsy and all the other events we've seen where the FBI goes out and actually creates
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.400]  these terror groups, that is what I would do if I was them. And we know Bill Clinton
[10:37.400 --> 10:43.840]  on Air Force One in front of the huge press corps right after he won re-election in 2000
[10:43.840 --> 10:50.000]  in 1996, excuse me, said he owed his re-election when he was 10 points behind to the Oklahoma
[10:50.000 --> 10:55.780]  City bombing. And so they can use these type of tragic events as a pretext to demonize
[10:55.780 --> 11:02.800]  and try to basically outlaw their opposition. That's why he's calling Republicans semi-fascist,
[11:02.800 --> 11:07.480]  claiming that if we don't want dead people and illegal aliens voting or all these electronic
[11:07.480 --> 11:12.680]  voting machines or bail-in ballots that we're somehow fascist when they're the ones that
[11:12.680 --> 11:18.120]  are censoring and suppressing and raiding their political enemies. We now know the FBI admits
[11:18.120 --> 11:24.760]  Mark Zuckerberg told the truth last week on Joe Rogan when he said, the FBI came to us
[11:24.760 --> 11:30.080]  and said, do not have this story. It is election meddling. But it was a real story. They were
[11:30.080 --> 11:35.320]  election meddling. So they know there's a giant political realignment against globalism,
[11:35.320 --> 11:40.160]  neoliberalism around the world. And really the epicenter is the United States and places
[11:40.160 --> 11:44.640]  like Brazil with Bolsonaro. And they know they're losing support with the yellow vest
[11:44.640 --> 11:49.320]  and all these other movements. And so they know that austerity and the great reset, that
[11:49.320 --> 11:53.920]  as you pointed out, is an irreversible collapse if it goes much further, is unpopular. They're
[11:53.920 --> 11:58.360]  taking the gloves off and going to a pure authoritarian model. And I believe in the
[11:58.360 --> 12:04.960]  next 70 days, it is their main move. And again, they pre-programmed it, pre-rolled it out,
[12:04.960 --> 12:10.080]  pre-advertised it to provocateur or stage some very serious massive events. It might
[12:10.080 --> 12:16.600]  be a new war. It might be, oh, hackers took down a part of the power grid. It might not
[12:16.600 --> 12:22.240]  be a mass shooting. It might not be a bombing. But something big is going to happen. We're
[12:22.240 --> 12:26.080]  going to have a gigantic October surprise. What do you think?
[12:26.080 --> 12:32.680]  How do you, let's put Biden's address to the nation. I don't know if the broadcast, it
[12:32.680 --> 12:36.600]  doesn't seem to be to be newsworthy because it's purely political. What do you expect
[12:36.600 --> 12:41.640]  out of him? And how does that fit into your theory of the case when he's calling? This
[12:41.640 --> 12:45.800]  is worse than Hillary Clinton calling us the deplorables. I mean, right now, I would argue
[12:45.800 --> 12:51.000]  that two thirds of the nation back our policies when we talk about inflation, immigration,
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.520]  crime, wokeness in schools, the economy, on our side of the foot, this is Ron Brownstein.
[12:55.520 --> 13:00.240]  On our side of the football versus theirs, climate change, you know, whatever this, whatever
[13:00.240 --> 13:05.920]  their, their, this thing of democracy, because we got more votes than they have, and, and
[13:05.920 --> 13:10.560]  abortion is Brownstein saying that's what's going to motivate them. Put in your theory
[13:10.560 --> 13:16.120]  of the case, where does, where does Joe Biden's, they're all fascist or semi-fascist fit in
[13:16.120 --> 13:21.480]  and what do you anticipate he's going to tell the nation on Thursday night?
[13:21.480 --> 13:26.680]  Well, absolutely. What you just said is what he's going to say. He's going to say the Republicans
[13:26.680 --> 13:31.320]  want to take your vote. The Republicans want to take your right to kill children. The Republicans
[13:31.320 --> 13:36.720]  are evil. They're bad. And basically demonize the Republican party. Pop down because the
[13:36.720 --> 13:41.640]  populist realignment happened through the Republican party, not the Democratic party.
[13:41.640 --> 13:47.280]  And so he's going to try to basically expand this idea of beginning to outlaw the political
[13:47.280 --> 13:52.440]  opposition. And Democrats have been talking about outlawing the Republican party. We see
[13:52.440 --> 13:59.720]  them going around the country with Gozer and with Green and with countless other races.
[13:59.720 --> 14:04.400]  I mean, right here in Texas, with members of Congress, the Democrats are trying in
[14:04.400 --> 14:11.160]  court cases to bar multiple current members of Congress and people running from Congress
[14:11.160 --> 14:16.920]  to be able to not run because they questioned the 2020 election.
[14:16.920 --> 14:22.600]  And so they're trying to outlaw people running for office or being reelected to question
[14:22.600 --> 14:27.520]  election fraud. Well, we send the State Department around the world to try to make sure elections
[14:27.520 --> 14:32.120]  are free and fair. And if you measure up U.S. elections to elections in the third world
[14:32.120 --> 14:37.400]  that they say are fraudulent, we're way fraudulent than them by every yardstick. So they're trying
[14:37.400 --> 14:42.440]  to outlaw questioning elections and barring people from running. That's the greatest form
[14:42.440 --> 14:47.640]  of blocking the electoral process and blocking voters will. And then turning around, he's
[14:47.640 --> 14:52.760]  going to have an address and say that the Republicans are fascist. They don't want dead
[14:52.760 --> 14:57.920]  people and illegal aliens voting and they don't want mail-in ballots the same way we
[14:57.920 --> 15:02.880]  know they stole the 2020 election. So it's going to be a declaration of war and expansion
[15:02.880 --> 15:08.120]  of the ongoing declaration of war, not just against America's energy, not just our borders,
[15:08.120 --> 15:13.520]  not just our sovereignty, not just our currency, not just the value of our dollar, but a further
[15:13.520 --> 15:19.200]  declaration of war against anyone questioning any of their fraudulent narratives that are
[15:19.200 --> 15:20.200]  collapsing.
[15:20.200 --> 15:23.080]  I want to talk about, I'm going to get the FBI in a second, but I want to talk about
[15:23.080 --> 15:27.400]  these executive orders that you bring up, the one about the voting and the previous
[15:27.400 --> 15:31.880]  one. Do you believe that Republican Attorney Generals and the Republican Party elected
[15:31.880 --> 15:36.600]  officials have done enough to expose what those executive orders were, what they really
[15:36.600 --> 15:42.600]  say and to combat them, even at a state attorney general level, to contest what these executive
[15:42.600 --> 15:43.600]  orders are?
[15:43.600 --> 15:49.800]  Well, it's like you said a few days ago, our biggest problem is not even the Democrats.
[15:49.800 --> 15:54.000]  They're unpopular, they're criminal, they're disgusting, but the Republican leadership
[15:54.000 --> 16:00.640]  will not get on the ramparts, will not defend the gates, will not cover any real issues.
[16:00.640 --> 16:05.440]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular
[16:05.440 --> 16:11.040]  system, for your brain, for every part of your body, but what I don't see being promoted
[16:11.040 --> 16:18.920]  is the fact that it has natural, psychotropic effects. It certainly does for me. When I
[16:18.920 --> 16:24.920]  take a couple of these capsules an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing. Now,
[16:24.920 --> 16:30.640]  there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain,
[16:30.640 --> 16:35.160]  but I want you to experience it for yourself. We know it's good for your heart, we know
[16:35.160 --> 16:38.840]  it's good for your brain, we know it's good for your arteries and veins and your lungs
[16:38.840 --> 16:43.320]  and every other function of your body, but I want you to experience this high grade fish
[16:43.320 --> 16:48.640]  oil, this ultimate fish oil at infowarstore.com and see what it does if you take it before
[16:48.640 --> 16:55.680]  bed time. Ultimate fish oil, 50% off, now exclusively available at infowarstore.com. Thank you all
[16:55.680 --> 17:00.320]  for your support, you're really going to miss out if you don't get it.
[17:00.320 --> 17:04.040]  People say Alex Jones is crazy, he's a conspiracy theory guy, he's a nutcase, he's got these
[17:04.040 --> 17:11.120]  rants and all that. What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many
[17:11.120 --> 17:17.720]  different topics of signal, not noise. If you look at the signal and you compare that

[21:44.520 --> 21:51.120]  go back to the interview from yesterday between Steve Bannon and Alex Jones. Here it is.
[21:51.120 --> 21:55.280]  Our biggest problem is not even the Democrats. They are unpopular, they are criminal, they
[21:55.280 --> 21:59.640]  are disgusting, but the Republican leadership will not get on the ramparts, will not defend
[21:59.640 --> 22:07.000]  the gates, will not cover any real issues. They talk about small business stimulation
[22:07.000 --> 22:12.360]  packages that don't even pass and things that are not on people's radar, they are not talking
[22:12.360 --> 22:16.440]  about inflation, they are not even talking about human smuggling and open borders like
[22:16.440 --> 22:21.920]  they should, they are not talking about election fraud, they are not talking about any of the
[22:21.920 --> 22:25.960]  real things that concern Americans, they are not talking about the military still being
[22:25.960 --> 22:31.200]  forcibly inoculated or illegal aliens can pour in by the millions and not even be given
[22:31.200 --> 22:35.760]  COVID test or COVID shots, which I don't think they should be given COVID shots, but then
[22:35.760 --> 22:42.080]  Joe Kovic can't come here for the U.S. Open. The Republicans need to get on the offense
[22:42.080 --> 22:47.080]  but the Republican Rhino establishment is working with the Democrat Party establishment
[22:47.080 --> 22:54.960]  to fend off the populist, peaceful, political insurrection that has been taking the country
[22:54.960 --> 23:01.200]  and the world by storm. They are fighting us, they are attempting to bankrupt America
[23:01.200 --> 23:06.280]  to bring people to their knees in a giant cloud and privin' great reset model so that
[23:06.280 --> 23:12.120]  we're so poor and so destitute we've got to accept a communist socialist model with a
[23:12.120 --> 23:19.320]  high-tech technocracy, global ID, global carbon tax, global social credit score, global universal
[23:19.320 --> 23:25.080]  basic income. They're bringing down the old system that they've already sucked dry, hoses
[23:25.080 --> 23:30.400]  the saviors as they bring in their new tyranny. That's why the climate we're in is not like
[23:30.400 --> 23:35.360]  five years ago or 30 years ago or 40 years ago, it's closer to the climate we had during
[23:35.360 --> 23:41.640]  the Civil War where there's major competing factions battling over control of this country
[23:41.640 --> 23:47.160]  and they want the populist faction out of the game basically outlawed and labeled as
[23:47.160 --> 23:51.080]  terrorist. It's not gonna work though, that's why I warned the establishment that they really
[23:51.080 --> 23:56.040]  need to study history and look at what they've done and understand that drag queen story
[23:56.040 --> 24:01.760]  time and critical race theory has turned the country and really the world against them
[24:01.760 --> 24:06.680]  and that they should sue for peace, they should back down, they should not try to accelerate
[24:06.680 --> 24:11.160]  us into a civil war but you see it all over the news, civil war imminent, we're gonna
[24:11.160 --> 24:14.160]  have a war with the republics, we're gonna have a war with the populists, we're gonna
[24:14.160 --> 24:17.800]  arrest Trump, Lindsey Graham, if you arrest Trump there's gonna be a civil war, there's
[24:17.800 --> 24:23.200]  gonna be war on the streets. I don't, if they do arrest Trump I don't want war on the streets,
[24:23.200 --> 24:28.680]  I want total political realignment to the next level and we should talk about peaceful ways
[24:28.680 --> 24:33.680]  to not let them Steve provocateur us into violence.
[24:33.680 --> 24:37.920]  This is my point, Lindsey Graham and these guys who are never with us, for him to say
[24:37.920 --> 24:41.240]  that, because right now the momentum is on our side, everything they're trying to do
[24:41.240 --> 24:47.120]  from the suppression polls to divert the conversation over to civil war to all of this gets us off
[24:47.120 --> 24:51.720]  the target which is the target is November 8th in a sweeping, we could break the democratic
[24:51.720 --> 24:55.280]  party as a national political institution from the school, you guys have seen this in
[24:55.280 --> 24:59.440]  Texas from the school, what the Sanchez has done in Florida, from the school boards all
[24:59.440 --> 25:02.920]  the way up to the state legislatures to the house and the senate, they're trying to divert
[25:02.920 --> 25:07.960]  our attention, what would you tell the people out there that follow you, given the fact
[25:07.960 --> 25:12.200]  that they're gonna use information warfare like they've never done before, your I-Corps
[25:12.200 --> 25:15.600]  commander, what is it, we're gonna get to the book in the next break, but right now
[25:15.600 --> 25:20.480]  what should, what should the people that follow Alex Jones and the people that say, hey look,
[25:20.480 --> 25:25.360]  this guy's smart and tough and he's one of our leaders, what is your advice to the populist
[25:25.360 --> 25:27.600]  movement right now?
[25:27.600 --> 25:34.080]  I would tell every person watching this to share this broadcast while it's live and later
[25:34.080 --> 25:38.560]  when it's archived, and I would have them send it to all of their liberal friends and
[25:38.560 --> 25:43.200]  left his friends and say, how long are you gonna be a chump, how long are you gonna be
[25:43.200 --> 25:48.160]  a fool, even if you're unable to vote in this election because of changing our party's
[25:48.160 --> 25:52.880]  law station still to it, you need to understand, you're gonna be bankrupt, you're gonna have
[25:52.880 --> 25:59.880]  no future if you don't wake up to the fact that some very criminal multinational corporations
[25:59.880 --> 26:04.280]  are using the Democratic Party to basically have a hostile corporate takeover of this
[26:04.280 --> 26:10.040]  country, then I would go out to every relative, every friend, every family, every employee,
[26:10.040 --> 26:16.800]  every boss, every stranger and I would tell them you need to go vote and you need to not
[26:16.800 --> 26:24.280]  just count on there being a red tsunami because there's gonna be a blue election fraud, firewall
[26:24.280 --> 26:29.120]  or seawall that's gonna try to block that, but we know from the studies in places like
[26:29.120 --> 26:34.480]  Texas and Florida, they run out of dead people and they run out of illegals on the ballot
[26:34.480 --> 26:39.400]  able to vote very, very quickly and they hit a wall, so we've got to counter them with
[26:39.400 --> 26:44.960]  absolute total and complete voting, okay, sure, I think I reach a lot of voters being
[26:44.960 --> 26:49.520]  on there myself, why do I need to go vote, well, because every vote counts and even if
[26:49.520 --> 26:55.240]  you think your state's red, it's not for long, we have to crush them now, everybody watching
[26:55.240 --> 26:58.640]  has to go to the city council, they're school board, even if you don't have children, you've
[26:58.640 --> 27:03.640]  got to go to the county commission, people are watching those commissions, those hearings
[27:03.640 --> 27:08.240]  go out, they get picked up, they go viral, everyone, especially America's veterans because
[27:08.240 --> 27:14.680]  this is the real fight for the republic itself, must go every week to every televised hearing
[27:14.680 --> 27:19.640]  whether you're in a small town or a big city, everyone must call C-SPAN, everyone must call
[27:19.640 --> 27:25.840]  on the liberal talk radio, everyone must understand that this is a massive historic crossroads
[27:25.840 --> 27:31.200]  and the enemies of freedom know that and we need a maximum effort to go out and to study
[27:31.200 --> 27:36.080]  the ballot and to vote for good people and to just do everything we can to just have
[27:36.080 --> 27:38.920]  such a giant red wave, they can't stop us.
[27:38.920 --> 27:44.320]  Alex, hand on one second, the great reset in the war for the world, the central battlefield
[27:44.320 --> 27:47.720]  is the United States of America, all next in the war room.
[27:47.720 --> 27:53.040]  We will fight till they're all gone, we rejoice when they're no more, let's take down the
[27:53.040 --> 27:55.040]  C-SPAN.
[27:55.040 --> 27:58.760]  War Room, Pandemic with Stephen K. Bannon.
[27:58.760 --> 28:02.400]  The epidemic is a demon and we cannot let this demon hide.
[28:02.400 --> 28:09.400]  War Room, Pandemic, here's your host, Stephen K. Bannon.
[28:09.400 --> 28:13.120]  Okay, thank you very much, by the way, as soon as we get that ad, I want to play that.
[28:13.120 --> 28:15.880]  We got it, let's go, I tell you what, ask for a bringing back in, I got to play this
[28:15.880 --> 28:21.560]  because it's so powerful, let's hit it.

[28:26.000 --> 28:31.600]  mainstream media are going to have to sit there and we've got to force them to respond
[28:31.600 --> 28:32.960]  to this book.
[28:32.960 --> 28:36.920]  This book is that important, Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter.
[28:36.920 --> 28:43.080]  If you compare the finest, and I tell you, you take MIT technology review, you take science,
[28:43.080 --> 28:48.200]  take all these magazines and journals, add the electronic part of it, and you know, NPR,
[28:48.200 --> 28:54.000]  PBS, all of it, I'll match up and we'll go through and we'll do what Alex Jones put

[33:26.640 --> 33:33.280]  Steve Bannon, two powerhouses in the alternative right information sphere, coming together
[33:33.280 --> 33:38.080]  to face off against our common enemy, the globalist scumbags that are destroying this
[33:38.080 --> 33:44.760]  country and the entire world, here it is, without any further ado, Alex Jones and Steve Bannon.
[33:44.760 --> 33:49.640]  Okay, Alex Jones is my guest, you're in the war room, it's the 30th of August in the year
[33:49.640 --> 33:53.960]  of our Lord 2022, Alex, I think you've done a pretty good job of forcing them to read
[33:53.960 --> 34:02.520]  it given how you've walked through what you anticipate they're up to in the next 70 days,
[34:02.520 --> 34:08.600]  because your book makes the case that the United States of America, this beloved constitutional
[34:08.600 --> 34:13.760]  republic we were bequeath, is the central battlefield on this global reset in the war
[34:13.760 --> 34:14.760]  for the world.
[34:14.760 --> 34:15.760]  Can you explain that, sir?
[34:15.760 --> 34:20.080]  And I want to add in the developments that have happened with the FBI agents over the
[34:20.080 --> 34:25.080]  last 24 hours, how that fits into your theory of the case as you lay it out in this book,
[34:25.080 --> 34:29.720]  and this book is for the people that hate Alex Jones the most, for the people that think
[34:29.720 --> 34:35.840]  he's a charlatan and a carney barker, I strongly recommend that you read this book.
[34:35.840 --> 34:40.680]  You may still hate him at the end of it, but you will respect the intellectual integrity
[34:40.680 --> 34:45.200]  of this book because it's a very, very powerful document, Alex Jones.
[34:45.200 --> 34:49.040]  I'll see if I appreciate that, and look, I'm on the air four hours a day, I've been on
[34:49.040 --> 34:53.640]  there 28 years, I screw around, have some fun sometimes, it gets taken out of context,
[34:53.640 --> 34:57.280]  I hate myself sometimes, but I don't really joke around and have fun anymore the last
[34:57.280 --> 35:01.280]  few years, because the world is so serious now as they're having trouble finding the
[35:01.280 --> 35:06.600]  satire to take it out of context, but getting back to your point about why they have to
[35:06.600 --> 35:11.360]  take America out, it's what Ronald Reagan told us, Ronald Reagan wasn't perfect getting
[35:11.360 --> 35:15.720]  conservative ideas through, he got a lot of things done that were good, some things that
[35:15.720 --> 35:24.160]  were bad, but Reagan made the world love America, and made the world love American ideals of
[35:24.160 --> 35:30.440]  private property and family and freedom of religion and capitalism and security and
[35:30.440 --> 35:36.760]  peace through strength, and he was an ambassador to the world, the world absolutely loved
[35:36.760 --> 35:42.600]  America, we were at the pinnacle of our strength at the end of World War II, and then again
[35:42.600 --> 35:46.840]  with Ronald Reagan, and then since then it's been our presidents pretty much selling us
[35:46.840 --> 35:51.600]  out to globalism until Trump comes along, and then Trump makes it about America again,
[35:51.600 --> 35:56.200]  because how can America be a leader in the world if it's not free and successful and
[35:56.200 --> 35:57.200]  powerful?
[35:57.200 --> 36:04.560]  So, if we're bringing in a worldwide corporate, panopticonic surveillance, Mark of the Beast,
[36:04.560 --> 36:12.520]  control freak, mad scientist run, great reset, build back better, depopulation nightmare,
[36:12.520 --> 36:18.400]  you can't have a free country like the United States of America that's an example to others
[36:18.400 --> 36:23.560]  to aspire to as a model, just like our Constitution became the model of the world.
[36:23.560 --> 36:29.920]  They want communist China, and its authoritarianism, and its death camps, and the Uyghurs, and
[36:29.920 --> 36:35.160]  forced labor, and 16 hour work days, and the government turning your power off when
[36:35.160 --> 36:40.920]  they want, and social credit scores, they want that to be the model, these multinational
[36:40.920 --> 36:47.160]  Fortune 500, pretty much to a company, allied with communist China, to parlay that power
[36:47.160 --> 36:48.480]  into their world government.
[36:48.480 --> 36:52.440]  Now, Russia's got its own problems, and I'm not lionizing Russia, but it's trying to
[36:52.440 --> 36:57.520]  be its own sovereign nation, that's why it's public enemy number one as a country, but
[36:57.520 --> 37:03.000]  the United States, and what it was, and what it could be, is the real number one enemy.
[37:03.000 --> 37:07.600]  Russia becomes a junior enemy when you pull back and realize everything is to undermine
[37:07.600 --> 37:12.520]  the country, everything is to destroy confidence, everything is to break up our families, everything
[37:12.520 --> 37:17.120]  is to destroy our veterans, everything is to ship in fentanyl, it's all about demoralizing
[37:17.120 --> 37:22.160]  us to break our will, then they can get control of our science and our military, and once
[37:22.160 --> 37:28.320]  they believe they have a godless authoritarian America, now we will make Nazi Germany look
[37:28.320 --> 37:34.080]  like a choir boy compared to what the New World Order can do once America falls and becomes
[37:34.080 --> 37:35.240]  an absolute tyranny.
[37:35.240 --> 37:40.360]  So the war for the world, the epicenter is the United States of America, and so that's
[37:40.360 --> 37:44.840]  why I titled it, the war for the world.
[37:44.840 --> 37:49.000]  The great reset in the world for the world, everybody should go, it's on sale, I don't
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.360]  know if bookstores are gonna stock this, but definitely it's on Amazon and you can go to
[37:53.360 --> 37:56.160]  your site, so everybody should get it today, you should read it.
[37:56.160 --> 38:01.040]  I wanna go to the central, one of the central theses is about decarbonization, deindustrialization,
[38:01.040 --> 38:06.840]  depopulation, but you make the case about wokeness and also your work over the last
[38:06.840 --> 38:12.760]  20 years in transhumanism, to tie that together in the great reset and why is this actually
[38:12.760 --> 38:16.280]  the underpinnings of what this fights about?
[38:16.280 --> 38:21.520]  Well, George Arwell's real name was Eric Blair and he'd been a top communist and a top Fabian
[38:21.520 --> 38:26.640]  socialist and he'd fought against Hitler in the Spanish Civil War and he believed in it,
[38:26.640 --> 38:31.480]  and then he learned how evil Stalin was and so he wrote a book in 1984 about what the
[38:31.480 --> 38:37.520]  world would look like if Stalin's revolution succeeded, and in the book it's really about
[38:37.520 --> 38:43.680]  destroying language, destroying words, outlawing words, making people scared of what they said,
[38:43.680 --> 38:48.120]  what they did, and that's what wokeness is, is giving Hollywood and the Democratic Party
[38:48.120 --> 38:53.760]  and the globalist control over language, control over every facet of society to then bring
[38:53.760 --> 38:59.360]  in old tyrannies, like discriminating against somebody off of what color they are, something
[38:59.360 --> 39:04.720]  the West got rid of, they turned our greatest strength around against us and now, oh, we're
[39:04.720 --> 39:09.120]  gonna fire the white teachers, we're not, we're, you know, because they're white, we're
[39:09.120 --> 39:14.400]  gonna not have white airline pilots because there's too many white people, these are authoritarian
[39:14.400 --> 39:23.480]  mainstays but now inverted, so it's a corporate authoritarianism masquerading as neo-liberalism
[39:23.480 --> 39:27.840]  and so they need us to say two men can have a baby, two women can have a baby, they need
[39:27.840 --> 39:34.280]  us to believe that we can be a dog if we want to, the furries phenomenon and Brad Queen
[39:34.280 --> 39:38.720]  story time, they have to get us to accept outrageous things because they want us to
[39:38.720 --> 39:43.920]  accept human animal hybrids, they want us to accept human clones, they're already growing
[39:43.920 --> 39:51.760]  for organs, they want us to accept no bar, no control, no governor on what these people
[39:51.760 --> 39:55.800]  can do and Elon Musk has talked about that, he says, beware of billionaires that worship
[39:55.800 --> 40:01.000]  AI gods and he's explained if we don't have 2.2 children, civilizational collapse, they're
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.600]  building an anti-human civilization, he's come out and says he wants a pro-human civilization,
[40:05.600 --> 40:10.680]  he's on against cybernetic augmentation, if you choose it, if it's not forced on you
[40:10.680 --> 40:16.160]  and if it helps you, my uncle was in a motorcycle wreck 30 years ago, had really bad epilepsy,
[40:16.160 --> 40:20.920]  he got one of those Vega nerve stimulators, basically stopped having seizures, then that
[40:20.920 --> 40:26.080]  failed three years ago, he actually got a more advanced brain chip, doesn't have seizures,
[40:26.080 --> 40:30.200]  not in a wheelchair anymore, lives great, has a great life, that brain chip is a wonderful
[40:30.200 --> 40:36.000]  thing, I'm not against progress, but we don't want to make people take brain chips, so there's
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.200]  all these opportunities with all this technology, we just don't want it to be tied to a global
[40:40.200 --> 40:46.320]  social credit score and to have the head of the Davos group say, soon school children by 2030,
[40:46.320 --> 40:50.280]  we'll have a chip in the brain to communicate and if you don't have chip, you won't be able
[40:50.280 --> 40:55.840]  to, I mean this is what they're saying and it's an attack on free will, so wokeism is
[40:55.840 --> 41:02.560]  about just getting us a stand in our head or if they say jump, we say how high, to accept
[41:02.560 --> 41:09.440]  absurdity, so then we hand over our personal authority to the technocrats, to the transhumanists,
[41:09.440 --> 41:13.360]  this whole revolution isn't liberal, it's not communist, they use that as a control
[41:13.360 --> 41:20.220]  mechanism, it is a transhumanist, mad scientist, hour grab of the future, the great reset,
[41:20.220 --> 41:21.520]  the war for the world.
[41:21.520 --> 41:26.720]  Okay, the book is out today, you can get it on Amazon, it's a, it's a must read, Alex,
[41:26.720 --> 41:30.200]  I know you're jammed, but I want to just hold you through the break, I've got just a, one
[41:30.200 --> 41:34.120]  or two questions on the other side, we're also going to be joined by Brandon Showalter
[41:34.120 --> 41:38.680]  from the Christian post of this blockbuster investigative reporting on the children's
[41:38.680 --> 41:42.600]  hospital up in Boston, Boston Children's Hospital, the reality of what they've been
[41:42.600 --> 41:48.000]  doing as far as surgeries go, also Joe Allen, our editor for transhumanism, is also going
[41:48.000 --> 41:52.880]  to join us, he's going to make some comments and observations on what Alex Jones has been
[41:52.880 --> 41:57.400]  working on for many decades and also he was the one that really got deeply into this Boston
[41:57.400 --> 42:00.920]  Children's Hospital story, so we're going to take a short commercial break, we return,
[42:00.920 --> 42:05.440]  we've got the one and only Alex Jones, the book is the great reset in the war for the
[42:05.440 --> 42:10.320]  world, he's making the case that the central battlefield is the United States of America,
[42:10.320 --> 42:12.440]  we're going to return in the war room in just a moment.
[42:12.440 --> 42:25.320]  Alright folks, we are going to return on the other side as well to finish up that interview
[42:25.320 --> 42:29.760]  between Steve Bannon and Alex Jones, the book is called The Great Reset and the War for

[42:34.280 --> 42:40.800]  rare times we actually encourage you to go use Sauron's delivery service, but drive it
[42:40.800 --> 42:44.960]  up the charts, get the book to number one, that exposes it to more people, it's using
[42:44.960 --> 42:50.400]  the weapons of the enemy against them and to spread the information that destroys their
[42:50.400 --> 42:55.320]  lives, so infowarsstore.com, purchase some products or get the book at Amazon and help

[43:05.440 --> 43:11.040]  system, for your brain, for every part of your body, but what I don't see being promoted
[43:11.040 --> 43:18.880]  is the fact that it has natural, psychotropic effects, it certainly does for me, when I

[44:58.280 --> 45:00.000]  them quite often now.
[45:00.000 --> 45:05.080]  We brought the game changing product previously only available to major oil companies around

[46:08.040 --> 46:11.400]  you know I went a little bit crazy, I put turbo force in my coffee, that was a crazy
[46:11.400 --> 46:15.400]  week, I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, turbo force is my favorite

[46:36.960 --> 46:40.000]  happens very often, it's never happened to me, I've never had anyone knock on my door
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.520]  and said Tate, you're such a good guy, how can I improve your life in every single way,
[46:43.520 --> 46:47.080]  there's only one person who woke up and thought that and that was me, I woke up and thought
[46:47.080 --> 46:50.360]  you know what, okay, I wanna take control of my life, I wanna take control of my health
[46:50.360 --> 46:53.000]  and that's why you need to go to infowars.com, take control of your health right now and

[47:18.600 --> 47:22.840]  Alright welcome back ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones show, you're watching
[47:22.840 --> 47:28.480]  us on infowars.com, band.video or however you're watching us, congratulations on circumventing
[47:28.480 --> 47:35.560]  the censorship and finding the truth and we're gonna go back now to that interview between
[47:35.560 --> 47:40.160]  Steve Bannon and Alex Jones about the book The Grey Reset and the War for the World about
[47:40.160 --> 47:46.000]  transhumanism and the ultimate goals that those transhumanists have for the rest of
[47:46.000 --> 47:47.000]  us.
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.640]  We're gonna go back to that now and finish up with this interview before Owen Schroyer
[47:51.640 --> 47:56.200]  comes in and takes over the show for the second hour but here's the rest of Steve Bannon
[47:56.200 --> 47:59.560]  and Alex Jones talking yesterday.
[47:59.560 --> 48:01.120]  Okay our guest is Alex Jones.
[48:01.120 --> 48:06.480]  Alex, Napoleon used to tell his marshals, the marshals of France and particularly after
[48:06.480 --> 48:12.360]  a couple of big engagements, he said when you set out to take Vienna, take Vienna.
[48:12.360 --> 48:18.160]  What is your message now to the populist nationalist movement in this country, this inclusive nationalism
[48:18.160 --> 48:23.240]  regardless of your race or your ethnicity, particularly those hard working Hispanic Americans
[48:23.240 --> 48:29.760]  down the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas in your beloved state, also in Arizona, California,
[48:29.760 --> 48:33.240]  all throughout the country, African American men, particularly men that are turned off
[48:33.240 --> 48:34.280]  by this wokeness.
[48:34.280 --> 48:38.600]  What is your message for the next 70 days, sir?
[48:38.600 --> 48:43.480]  My message is, Paul Schwab, Bill Gates, the Democratic Party of the New World Order, they're
[48:43.480 --> 48:46.200]  a global party of authoritarianism.
[48:46.200 --> 48:49.720]  It's the same in Australia, the same in Germany, the same in France, the same here.
[48:49.720 --> 48:53.080]  We need to join Bolsonaro, we need to join Victor Orbán, we need to join other leaders
[48:53.080 --> 48:55.840]  around the world, we need to get Trump re-elected.
[48:55.840 --> 49:02.880]  We need to realize that we are being enslaved by corporate fascism, masquerading as neoliberalism,
[49:02.880 --> 49:08.520]  and you've got to be 100% all in, because if you think 49% increases in electricity
[49:08.520 --> 49:13.200]  prices last year is bad, if you think gas prices doubling the last two years is bad,
[49:13.200 --> 49:20.680]  if you think any of this is bad, the globalists admit they want to bankrupt us and bring us
[49:20.680 --> 49:25.240]  to our knees permanently, they have horrible plans for the average American.
[49:25.240 --> 49:26.800]  This is life and death.
[49:26.800 --> 49:31.480]  This isn't a game, as Steve Bannon said a few days ago and all the actuaries show it.
[49:31.480 --> 49:37.640]  Already the lockdowns the last two and a half years, already the regulations, already what's
[49:37.640 --> 49:41.000]  been done has put us into a collapse.
[49:41.000 --> 49:45.120]  The plane's crashing, the question is, can it be a survivable crash landing?
[49:45.120 --> 49:48.640]  We need to get these people out of there now, we need to get rid of the Klaus Schwabs that
[49:48.640 --> 49:51.840]  are in control of our government, he brags his control of our government, the Canadian
[49:51.840 --> 49:54.120]  government, he penetrates the government.
[49:54.120 --> 50:00.800]  We have to stop them, get them out of control of our system and then try to crash land the
[50:00.800 --> 50:04.840]  airplane or if you think things are bad now folks, you have not seen anything yet.
[50:04.840 --> 50:11.560]  This is a real global corporate technocrat takeover for economic and cultural warfare
[50:11.560 --> 50:13.120]  of America and the world.
[50:13.120 --> 50:16.840]  This is the war for the world and people better choose a side.
[50:16.840 --> 50:20.520]  Freedom and justice and prosperity are total destruction.
[50:20.520 --> 50:25.400]  The Democratic Party is literally run by international criminals, they're literally run by the CCP.
[50:25.400 --> 50:29.560]  It's in Hunter Biden's laptop and we now know this head FBI guy got marched out two
[50:29.560 --> 50:35.880]  days ago and fired because we now know that it's been declassified, he ordered the Hunter
[50:35.880 --> 50:41.320]  laptop sealed, he ordered them to threaten the media not to cover it, he ordered it put
[50:41.320 --> 50:46.800]  in a secret file so nobody could see it and it's only because of a bunch of good FBI agents
[50:46.800 --> 50:52.920]  that lost their jobs or were put on leave that we even know about this.
[50:52.920 --> 50:57.040]  So the FBI is not our enemy, the people running it though are an enemy and we're never going
[50:57.040 --> 51:01.240]  to fix it until we have taken the whole government back over and I think we have to break up
[51:01.240 --> 51:06.440]  these federal agencies once and for all because you can't have one central national police
[51:06.440 --> 51:13.840]  force like the FBI but we are at such a historic crossroads and it's all coming out in the
[51:13.840 --> 51:20.720]  open and the globalists have lost, their only hope is to smash and collapse everything before
[51:20.720 --> 51:23.480]  the people actually wake up and bring them to justice.
[51:23.480 --> 51:29.960]  They hope the collapse creates such a giant smoke screen and such a fog of war that somehow
[51:29.960 --> 51:30.960]  they slink away.
[51:30.960 --> 51:34.480]  I've looked at every possible development in that, they're never getting away with what
[51:34.480 --> 51:35.480]  they've done.
[51:35.480 --> 51:41.120]  The question is do they want to just run off with their money now and we'll put them
[51:41.120 --> 51:46.960]  in abstentia like Napoleon or if they come creeping back and try another war with us,
[51:46.960 --> 51:49.640]  they're going to actually get put in prison for the rest of their lives.
[51:49.640 --> 51:54.200]  I would be happy for some of these globalists to slink off because I understand how dangerous
[51:54.200 --> 51:58.840]  they are and I understand this is going to really cause World War, you name it, if it
[51:58.840 --> 52:00.720]  keeps going down this road.
[52:00.720 --> 52:07.440]  So I would say if I was Trump, he should do a big televised speech and offer them amnesty,
[52:07.440 --> 52:11.800]  offer them pardon if they just put up their hands and give up and stop now because they're
[52:11.800 --> 52:16.400]  identified, the new order is out in the open, the great resets out in the open, more people
[52:16.400 --> 52:20.240]  learn about it every day, everybody's turning against them, they should just give up and
[52:20.240 --> 52:23.960]  come out with their hands up now and we will give them a good deal.
[52:23.960 --> 52:27.800]  Alex, for those people that are here for the first time and haven't had a chance to get
[52:27.800 --> 52:32.240]  to the show, given that they've tried to deplatform you over, how do people get to the Alex Jones
[52:32.240 --> 52:37.040]  show and get to watch it in real time, where do they go?
[52:37.040 --> 52:42.040]  Thanks for that, Steve, yeah, just like we have to go back to where it's on URLs and
[52:42.040 --> 52:48.320]  people go to those destinations, we don't count on the big CCP allied globalist operations,
[52:48.320 --> 52:54.240]  you go to infowars.com, we're just on the front page, there's audio and video, the live
[52:54.240 --> 52:59.160]  show, the archives and then my show, all the shows, hundreds of other band creators and
[52:59.160 --> 53:05.560]  researchers and filmmakers are at band.video, just the word band and then.video, you can
[53:05.560 --> 53:10.920]  find it all at infowars.com, but I just hope people go to amazon.com, I'm not a big Jeff
[53:10.920 --> 53:15.440]  Bezos fan, but we've made this book go to number six, it was you by the way, on my
[53:15.440 --> 53:19.720]  own show I can make it go to like number 50, but when you, the last two times we had you
[53:19.720 --> 53:23.680]  on, your audience is incredible, Steve, when you said we need to make this number one,
[53:23.680 --> 53:28.640]  it went to number six one time, number nine another, all because of your great audience
[53:28.640 --> 53:29.640]  of activists.
[53:29.640 --> 53:34.640]  Folks, we want to push this book to number one in the world, it's already ahead of Obama's
[53:34.640 --> 53:40.120]  book and Michelle Obama's book, it's already ahead of Herari's book, but we want to push
[53:40.120 --> 53:45.080]  it to number one and I thank the war room and it's great audience and Steve, I sleep
[53:45.080 --> 53:49.720]  better at night knowing you're there because there's not many people that have a giant
[53:49.720 --> 53:53.880]  grasp of how this works and when I've been tuning to your show for years and obviously
[53:53.880 --> 53:57.400]  watching you for years before that, but you really have an even greater understanding
[53:57.400 --> 54:01.240]  in many ways than I do and I'm very thankful you're there and I just really appreciate
[54:01.240 --> 54:02.240]  you.
[54:02.240 --> 54:06.760]  No, your iCore commander, you understood the big part of this was information war 30 years
[54:06.760 --> 54:09.240]  ago before people did, it's amazing.
[54:09.240 --> 54:13.400]  You got to go to Amazon, we need to make this book number one to make a statement, but most
[54:13.400 --> 54:16.000]  importantly, you're not going to be able to put this book down.
[54:16.000 --> 54:17.640]  It's not a beach read, it's a tough read.
[54:17.640 --> 54:20.600]  Get a pen, you're going to underline, you're going to take notes, get a notepad, you're
[54:20.600 --> 54:24.920]  going to jot stuff down, get questions to us, we'll get questions back to Alex, I'm
[54:24.920 --> 54:27.400]  sure he's going to give other talks on this.
[54:27.400 --> 54:28.400]  Today's the first.
[54:28.400 --> 54:29.400]  And Steve, here's the thing just real quick.
[54:29.400 --> 54:30.400]  Yes, sir.
[54:30.400 --> 54:31.400]  Yep.
[54:31.400 --> 54:35.080]  When people read this book, because I just read it again the other day, even though I
[54:35.080 --> 54:40.720]  wrote it, when you watch the news, you hear the slogans of the Democrats and then other
[54:40.720 --> 54:41.720]  liberal leaders.
[54:41.720 --> 54:46.360]  I mean, this is a global corporate fascist party, master rating is leftist.
[54:46.360 --> 54:48.000]  I mean, this is their blueprint, folks.
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  This is the blueprint of the Death Star.
[54:50.000 --> 54:51.000]  Please get it today.
[54:51.000 --> 54:52.000]  Steve, man, and thank you.
[54:52.000 --> 54:56.440]  No, no, no, I tell you, this is what the brains of Tony Lyons and the guys of Skyhorses to
[54:56.440 --> 55:00.480]  drop it 70 days ago because I tell people, if you get it, you read it over the Labor
[55:00.480 --> 55:05.240]  Day weekend or the next couple of days, the framing, your stuff, and particularly, I want
[55:05.240 --> 55:08.280]  the people that have never listened to Alex Jones or never read a word or never gone
[55:08.280 --> 55:11.920]  to the site and gotten any of the stories to get this, this is the audience we need
[55:11.920 --> 55:12.920]  to get it.
[55:12.920 --> 55:16.400]  Get the book and just make your own judgment, weigh and measure it yourself, and then just
[55:16.400 --> 55:17.760]  you'll use it as a framework.
[55:17.760 --> 55:21.440]  Other information will come in and you'll see the great reset in the war for the world.
[55:21.440 --> 55:22.440]  Alex, thanks.
[55:22.440 --> 55:23.440]  I know you're busy today.
[55:23.440 --> 55:24.440]  Thanks for taking time.
[55:24.440 --> 55:28.120]  The book's going to be huge and we look forward to having you back on.
[55:28.120 --> 55:29.120]  Thank you.
[55:29.120 --> 55:30.840]  Please phone my show, I know you're busy as well.
[55:30.840 --> 55:32.340]  Thank you, sir.
[55:32.340 --> 55:33.340]  Thank you.
[55:33.340 --> 55:34.340]  Alex Jones.
[55:34.340 --> 55:40.720]  It really is nice to see folks, these two titans of dissident politics come together and be
[55:40.720 --> 55:46.760]  so supportive of one another and I'll tell you, this book, we have a couple, a few copies
[55:46.760 --> 55:50.160]  sitting around the office, they're a little bit under lock and key.
[55:50.160 --> 55:51.160]  They won't let me take one.
[55:51.160 --> 55:54.440]  I haven't had a chance to read it, but while we've been sitting here and listening to the
[55:54.440 --> 55:59.040]  interview, I've been thumbing through a little bit and the great thing about it, I think
[55:59.040 --> 56:02.960]  is even just from the first chapter, you can tell Alex Jones wrote this.
[56:02.960 --> 56:04.920]  It's not a ghost writer.
[56:04.920 --> 56:08.240]  It's not somebody else and they just put Alex Jones' name on it.
[56:08.240 --> 56:15.640]  The whole first chapter has this very long metaphor about tribesmen having arguments
[56:15.640 --> 56:21.480]  between Thag and Uther as they try to determine the best path forward for the tribe.
[56:21.480 --> 56:25.680]  If you read this and you know Alex Jones, it's in his voice, but of course it's different
[56:25.680 --> 56:29.760]  than what you get on Info Wars with him speaking off the cuff.
[56:29.760 --> 56:34.120]  It's been researched, it's been thought about, but it is very much in line with what you
[56:34.120 --> 56:35.880]  expect from Alex Jones.
[56:35.880 --> 56:38.120]  I'm just looking forward to reading this myself.
[56:38.120 --> 56:40.200]  I know a lot of people out there are as well.
[56:40.200 --> 56:45.480]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com to get a copy or go to Amazon in the rare occasion that we actually
[56:45.480 --> 56:49.480]  ask you to go to Amazon because you can drive this up the charts and people go to the charts
[56:49.480 --> 56:52.400]  and if they're looking for a book to read, they're going to go see what's at the top
[56:52.400 --> 56:54.960]  of the chart and if it strikes their interest, they'll purchase it.
[56:54.960 --> 57:00.280]  It really can spread this information in a massive way.
[57:00.280 --> 57:03.960]  Even if you don't buy the book, go to InfoWarsStore.com to get some of the supplements, get some
[57:03.960 --> 57:06.600]  of the survival material.
[57:06.600 --> 57:10.920]  I don't have to tell you today, Jackson, Mississippi has no more water and they don't
[57:10.920 --> 57:17.080]  even have bottled water to give to their residents and don't wait until something like that happens
[57:17.080 --> 57:21.080]  to go, gosh, I should have gotten a water filter, gosh, I should have gotten storeable
[57:21.080 --> 57:22.080]  food.
[57:22.080 --> 57:26.000]  I only had listened to the guides at InfoWars and actually prepared for something like this
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.680]  because once it happens, it's too late.
[57:28.680 --> 57:31.120]  You need water tomorrow, you need it today.
[57:31.120 --> 57:36.480]  Get the water filters, get the survival materials, everything at InfoWarsStore.com, massive discounts

[59:01.800 --> 59:03.680]  a toxic way.
[59:03.680 --> 59:08.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, we went out and did deep research on the safest, healthiest ways

[59:45.360 --> 59:52.360]  I can't wait for the reviews because it's worked great for me.
[59:52.360 --> 1:00:01.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:01.120 --> 1:00:07.520]  25 years ago, Princess Diana's car crashed inside the Pont de la Alma tunnel in Paris,
[1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:08.520]  France.
[1:00:08.520 --> 1:00:13.320]  Her lover, Dottie Fayette, died upon impact along with the driver.
[1:00:13.320 --> 1:00:18.560]  And even though Diana survived, it took about 40 minutes to get her from the car to the
[1:00:18.560 --> 1:00:19.560]  ambulance.
[1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:24.280]  The official story was that they were trying to free her from the car, but several witnesses
[1:00:24.280 --> 1:00:28.360]  say that Diana was conscious and unobstructed.
[1:00:28.360 --> 1:00:33.660]  Photographs show that the back seat of the car was undamaged, and witnesses were pleading
[1:00:33.660 --> 1:00:36.480]  with the police to open her and help her.
[1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:40.840]  Once in the ambulance, it took about 40 minutes for them to choose a pedal, and when they
[1:00:40.840 --> 1:00:46.520]  finally set off, the ambulance drove at a snail's pace and made several stops, taking
[1:00:46.520 --> 1:00:51.200]  about 40 minutes to drive less than four miles.
[1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:57.320]  Doctors were turned away, witnesses were stripped searched, cameras were confiscated, no evidence
[1:00:57.320 --> 1:01:03.640]  was gathered, no blood samples were taken, and by 3 a.m. the entire scene was sprayed
[1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:06.600]  down with high-pressure water hoses.
[1:01:06.600 --> 1:01:12.480]  Mercedes wanted to study the wreckage to see why it failed so badly, but they were denied.
[1:01:12.480 --> 1:01:17.680]  Diana's body was taken by the royal family, who had her reproductive organs removed before
[1:01:17.680 --> 1:01:19.800]  burying her remains.
[1:01:19.800 --> 1:01:26.120]  All 17 cameras along the route of the crash were mysteriously turned off, and all radio
[1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:29.320]  police frequencies went down.
[1:01:29.320 --> 1:01:33.440]  Witnesses were assaulted and threatened, and there was no investigation.
[1:01:33.440 --> 1:01:38.400]  Not until the inquest 10 years later, which is when most people learned that Diana had
[1:01:38.400 --> 1:01:44.600]  penned a note in 1996 saying that someone was going to kill her in a car accident.
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:47.440]  This note was concealed for six years.
[1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:52.000]  At the inquest, experts agreed that Diana would have survived if they had gotten her
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:57.520]  to a hospital, but the blame was put upon a military-style attack.
[1:01:57.520 --> 1:02:03.880]  According to witnesses, a group of motorcycles, along with a white Fiat Uno, worked in concert
[1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:09.560]  to crash the car, first with a blinding flash of light, followed by an explosion from the
[1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:11.960]  front tire of the Mercedes.
[1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:19.520]  During the inquest, a former MI6 agent described being shown the very same plan in 1992 for
[1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:28.140]  a possible MI6 assassination of Slobodan Milosevic, and claimed it was MI6 who killed Diana.
[1:02:28.140 --> 1:02:33.520]  Because of all this, the inquest ended with the verdict of unlawful killing, blaming her
[1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:37.200]  death on the mysterious military hit squad.
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:43.200]  But the mainstream media spun the entire thing to make it sound like it was the paparazzi
[1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:46.640]  that caused her to crash, which is demonstrably false.
[1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:51.800]  And while there was no investigation into finding the members of this military hit squad,
[1:02:51.800 --> 1:02:58.040]  three years later the alleged driver of the white Fiat, who had ties to MI6, reportedly
[1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:03.920]  committed suicide after being found shot twice in the back of the head and burned inside
[1:03:03.920 --> 1:03:05.600]  of his car.
[1:03:05.600 --> 1:03:11.160]  During the inquest, many things were kept from the jury, such as the fact that Diana's seat
[1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:16.520]  belt was found to be defective and evidence of the car being sabotaged.
[1:03:16.520 --> 1:03:21.840]  Interestingly, these things would have brought more suspicion towards Dadi's father, Mohammed
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:27.000]  al-Fayed, who, after turning down repeated offers from the French government to provide
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:32.960]  security, was solely responsible for Diana's security detail, and at the last minute had
[1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:38.200]  them leave their security detail in front of the hotel as a decoy and take a different
[1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:45.920]  car, a car that was recently stolen, broken, repaired, and never checked by security.
[1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:50.480]  Left with only one security guard, they were also assigned a new driver.
[1:03:50.480 --> 1:03:55.840]  Henri Paul, who had no chauffeur permit, was tied to foreign intelligence services, was
[1:03:55.840 --> 1:04:02.240]  seen on camera signaling to someone just before setting off, had received over 50,000 francs
[1:04:02.240 --> 1:04:03.840]  the day of the crash.
[1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:08.960]  And this was all under the watch of Mohammed al-Fayed, who was deeply connected to the
[1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:10.640]  intelligence community.
[1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:15.880]  He was business partners with one of Lee Harvey Oswald's handlers, and represented the grandfather
[1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:18.160]  of Mohammed Atta.
[1:04:18.160 --> 1:04:20.760]  But none of that was mentioned during the inquest.
[1:04:20.760 --> 1:04:26.800]  Instead, with the help of pop culture agents such as Howard Stern and Piers Morgan, Mohammed
[1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:30.800]  al-Fayed has provided the world with the cover story.
[1:04:30.800 --> 1:04:35.760]  Pretty shocking who Diana was there from, Dadi's child, Reese, you just can't trust
[1:04:35.760 --> 1:04:36.760]  anything.
[1:04:36.760 --> 1:04:42.080]  The lies we've been told, the deaths, the ritualistic deaths and murders that the Illuminati and
[1:04:42.080 --> 1:04:45.600]  New World Order has gotten away with, it's all gonna be exposed.
[1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:50.560]  You can find the full report at band.video from Gregory's.
[1:04:50.560 --> 1:04:59.560]  Owen Schreuer here, I take over the Alex Jones show on the other side of this break.
[1:04:59.560 --> 1:05:05.120]  Vitamin mineral fusion is your one stop shop for health, for longevity, for a boosted immune
[1:05:05.120 --> 1:05:06.120]  system.
[1:05:06.120 --> 1:05:10.600]  And the climate we live in today and what the globalists are up to, I think anybody not
[1:05:10.600 --> 1:05:13.040]  taking a high quality product like this is insane.
[1:05:13.040 --> 1:05:17.880]  And there's other great vitamin mineral amino acid, you know, complete products out there.
[1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:22.080]  Ours is amongst the very best and it is a lower cost than many of the leading brands.
[1:05:22.080 --> 1:05:27.200]  But whatever you do, take a high quality, multi vitamin mineral amino acid system like
[1:05:27.200 --> 1:05:32.520]  this that's liquid that you put in water because you have a better absorption rate when you
[1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:33.520]  do that.
[1:05:33.520 --> 1:05:36.000]  Now, vitamin mineral fusion is our overall best selling product.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:40.140]  It finally came in a month ago and we've almost sold out of the first shipment, hopefully
[1:05:40.140 --> 1:05:44.440]  more is coming in a few months, but if you want to experience vitamin mineral fusion

[1:05:51.120 --> 1:05:52.720]  We've all got to stick together.
[1:05:52.720 --> 1:05:58.120]  Vitamin mineral fusion is 40% off even though it's selling out at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:58.120 --> 1:06:01.120]  Thanks for your support.
[1:06:01.120 --> 1:06:13.600]  Broadcasting live from the U.N. Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex
[1:06:13.600 --> 1:06:17.600]  Jones show and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:40.340]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, there's been a major development with the FBI, the Mar-a-Lago
[1:06:40.340 --> 1:06:49.140]  raid and just in general are just totally corrupt government officials on both sides
[1:06:49.140 --> 1:06:50.140]  of the aisle.
[1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:53.660]  It's on full display today.
[1:06:53.660 --> 1:06:54.940]  And so where do I begin?
[1:06:54.940 --> 1:07:06.140]  Do I start with Merrick Garland telling all federal employees not to communicate with
[1:07:06.140 --> 1:07:11.900]  Congress because there have been dozens of whistleblowers from the FBI, the DOJ and other
[1:07:11.900 --> 1:07:17.740]  outlets, other government institutions going to Republican members of Congress as whistleblowers
[1:07:17.740 --> 1:07:25.740]  and saying, look, the hostile anti-American Communist Democrat Party has taken over these
[1:07:25.740 --> 1:07:26.740]  institutions.
[1:07:26.740 --> 1:07:27.740]  They're not acting in good faith.
[1:07:27.740 --> 1:07:29.140]  They're acting illegally.
[1:07:29.140 --> 1:07:30.240]  They have targets.
[1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:31.980]  They have targets on Trump's back.
[1:07:31.980 --> 1:07:34.220]  They have targets on the American people's back.
[1:07:34.220 --> 1:07:36.460]  They're not doing their job as they're supposed to.
[1:07:36.460 --> 1:07:42.620]  It's become a political wing, a militant wing used against the Democrat Party opposition.
[1:07:42.620 --> 1:07:46.100]  And so dozens of these whistleblowers have gone to members of Congress.
[1:07:46.100 --> 1:07:51.100]  And so Merrick Garland sends a statement out to all federal employees saying, you're not
[1:07:51.100 --> 1:07:53.020]  allowed to talk to Congress.
[1:07:53.020 --> 1:07:54.020]  Wow.
[1:07:54.020 --> 1:08:02.900]  I mean, folks, you have FBI agents saying Christopher Wray needs to resign for corruption.
[1:08:02.900 --> 1:08:10.020]  The same thing is being said of Merrick Garland now today as well.
[1:08:10.020 --> 1:08:12.900]  So I mean, they know what they're doing is illegal.
[1:08:12.900 --> 1:08:15.020]  They know what they're doing is criminal.
[1:08:15.020 --> 1:08:18.940]  Merrick Garland is a rat.
[1:08:18.940 --> 1:08:20.780]  He's a weasel.
[1:08:20.780 --> 1:08:26.460]  And he's slithering around right now because he knows people are coming forward to tell
[1:08:26.460 --> 1:08:29.740]  Congress about his crimes and the crimes at the FBI.
[1:08:29.740 --> 1:08:34.580]  And so he sends out a memo saying, don't talk to Congress.
[1:08:34.580 --> 1:08:36.620]  You're not allowed to talk to Congress.
[1:08:36.620 --> 1:08:40.580]  You'll be punished if you do.
[1:08:40.580 --> 1:08:47.580]  Oh, just a subtle reminder that you're not allowed to blow the whistle.
[1:08:47.580 --> 1:08:52.220]  Oh, and where's the left wing that loves their whistleblower so much?
[1:08:52.220 --> 1:08:55.380]  Where are the liberals that are against big government corruption?
[1:08:55.380 --> 1:08:57.900]  Oh, they love it now because they're the ones running it.
[1:08:57.900 --> 1:08:58.900]  I see.
[1:08:58.900 --> 1:09:02.660]  So whistleblowers now, they don't want to hear from them.
[1:09:02.660 --> 1:09:05.860]  And the heads of the FBI and the DOJ saying, shut up, agents.
[1:09:05.860 --> 1:09:07.220]  You're not allowed to talk to Congress.
[1:09:07.220 --> 1:09:08.700]  You're not allowed to talk to the American people.
[1:09:08.700 --> 1:09:11.180]  Just shut up and do our bidding.
[1:09:11.180 --> 1:09:13.100]  That's all good for the new Democrat Party.
[1:09:13.100 --> 1:09:14.900]  After all, they're totalitarians.
[1:09:14.900 --> 1:09:16.340]  They're authoritarians.
[1:09:16.340 --> 1:09:17.340]  They're tyrants.
[1:09:17.340 --> 1:09:21.260]  They are out to crush this country.
[1:09:21.260 --> 1:09:25.500]  But first they must crush the opposition to the Democrat Party.
[1:09:25.500 --> 1:09:34.940]  Tom Cotton responds to this egregious offense from Merrick Garland, a threat, a veiled threat
[1:09:34.940 --> 1:09:41.660]  to FBI agents and Department of Justice officials, a threat to them that if they talk to Congress,
[1:09:41.660 --> 1:09:42.660]  he's going to target them.
[1:09:42.660 --> 1:09:45.020]  Now, who knows what that means.
[1:09:45.020 --> 1:09:46.900]  Remember what Chuck Schumer said?
[1:09:46.900 --> 1:09:48.420]  You mess with the intelligence agencies.
[1:09:48.420 --> 1:09:50.500]  They have five waves from Sunday of getting back at you.
[1:09:50.500 --> 1:09:53.340]  Donald Trump has learned that, hadn't he?
[1:09:53.340 --> 1:09:55.060]  These are corrupt people.
[1:09:55.060 --> 1:09:57.780]  Our Democrat Party is beyond corrupt.
[1:09:57.780 --> 1:10:01.900]  It's hostile towards the American people and the American way of life.
[1:10:01.900 --> 1:10:07.020]  And now it is running the Department of Justice and running the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[1:10:07.020 --> 1:10:10.620]  And now they are hostile towards the American people.
[1:10:10.620 --> 1:10:13.780]  And we know it, and the FBI whistleblowers are coming forward.
[1:10:13.780 --> 1:10:16.340]  So Merrick Garland says, don't do that.
[1:10:16.340 --> 1:10:18.020]  Don't tell people what we're doing.
[1:10:18.020 --> 1:10:22.700]  And if you do, we're going to come for you now.
[1:10:22.700 --> 1:10:23.700]  Unbelievable stuff.
[1:10:23.700 --> 1:10:28.100]  This is multi-fire alarm right here.
[1:10:28.100 --> 1:10:31.660]  This is sound the alarms.
[1:10:31.660 --> 1:10:39.260]  This is code red that you have whistleblowers coming forward telling you about the corruption
[1:10:39.260 --> 1:10:40.820]  in our institutions.
[1:10:40.820 --> 1:10:46.580]  And then the leaders say, don't you dare be transparent with the American people.
[1:10:46.580 --> 1:10:49.620]  And the liberal left that apparently is all for transparency, they're all okay with all
[1:10:49.620 --> 1:10:50.620]  of this.
[1:10:50.620 --> 1:10:56.820]  And the cotton responds, Department of Justice employees, take notice.
[1:10:56.820 --> 1:11:01.580]  No matter what this memo says, you are protected by federal law if you contact my office to
[1:11:01.580 --> 1:11:06.420]  blow the whistle on the improper politicization of the Department of Justice by Merrick Garland
[1:11:06.420 --> 1:11:08.900]  and Joe Biden.
[1:11:08.900 --> 1:11:12.900]  So again, now was it Merrick Garland?
[1:11:12.900 --> 1:11:14.660]  Was it his idea to put this memo out?
[1:11:14.660 --> 1:11:17.300]  Was it someone in the Biden White House?
[1:11:17.300 --> 1:11:20.100]  Was it Obama?
[1:11:20.100 --> 1:11:27.940]  His idea was it for Merrick Garland to send out a threat, a threat to federal agents who
[1:11:27.940 --> 1:11:30.180]  are blowing the whistle on government corruption.
[1:11:30.180 --> 1:11:32.500]  Who told Merrick Garland to do that?
[1:11:32.500 --> 1:11:35.260]  Because you take one look at that sniveling rat.
[1:11:35.260 --> 1:11:36.900]  He doesn't have a spine.
[1:11:36.900 --> 1:11:38.900]  He doesn't have testicular fortitude.
[1:11:38.900 --> 1:11:39.900]  He didn't do this.
[1:11:39.900 --> 1:11:42.060]  This was not his idea.
[1:11:42.060 --> 1:11:47.820]  He's a weak, he is a weak squishy sponge.
[1:11:47.820 --> 1:11:49.940]  He's an invertebrate.
[1:11:49.940 --> 1:11:52.460]  So who told Merrick Garland to write this?
[1:11:52.460 --> 1:11:54.900]  Who told Merrick Garland to put this letter out?
[1:11:54.900 --> 1:11:59.300]  Or maybe he really is so scared that he's going to be exposed for the criminal that
[1:11:59.300 --> 1:12:03.020]  he is that maybe he did really pen this memo himself.
[1:12:03.020 --> 1:12:04.300]  Maybe it really was his idea.
[1:12:04.300 --> 1:12:14.020]  I doubt that either way it shows you that the Biden regime and the American deep state
[1:12:14.020 --> 1:12:18.140]  are scared that you're going to find out what they're actually up to.
[1:12:18.140 --> 1:12:22.260]  Just like the liberals in the classrooms, sexually grooming children.
[1:12:22.260 --> 1:12:26.780]  Just like the doctors at the hospitals, sexually mutilating children.
[1:12:26.780 --> 1:12:29.460]  Just like they don't want you to know what they're doing.
[1:12:29.460 --> 1:12:31.140]  They try to hide what they're doing.
[1:12:31.140 --> 1:12:36.060]  Now that's what the Department of Justice and the FBI are doing.
[1:12:36.060 --> 1:12:41.340]  Threatening agents who blow the whistle on corruption.
[1:12:41.340 --> 1:12:44.460]  Threatening agents.
[1:12:44.460 --> 1:12:50.980]  Attorney General Merrick Garland threatens DOJ employees about contacting Congress.
[1:12:50.980 --> 1:12:56.620]  Now he's the one breaking the law, not FBI agents or Department of Justice officials
[1:12:56.620 --> 1:12:57.620]  going to Congress.
[1:12:57.620 --> 1:12:58.620]  That's their duty.
[1:12:58.620 --> 1:12:59.620]  That's their job.
[1:12:59.620 --> 1:13:01.060]  Congress is there for oversight.
[1:13:01.060 --> 1:13:03.060]  So that's the entire purpose.
[1:13:03.060 --> 1:13:09.260]  In fact, none of these institutions are supposed to be operating without Congress.
[1:13:09.260 --> 1:13:14.220]  But see, they've become their own institutions and they've become their own entity.
[1:13:14.220 --> 1:13:15.820]  And now they think they're bigger than Congress.
[1:13:15.820 --> 1:13:17.540]  No, Congress is over you.
[1:13:17.540 --> 1:13:21.300]  Congress can shut you down tomorrow if it wants and should.
[1:13:21.300 --> 1:13:23.140]  The FBI should be totally shut down.
[1:13:23.140 --> 1:13:25.620]  And by the way, Ted Cruz now agrees.
[1:13:25.620 --> 1:13:28.460]  The FBI needs to be shut down.
[1:13:28.460 --> 1:13:31.900]  The Department of Justice needs to be shut down.
[1:13:31.900 --> 1:13:34.180]  And the State Department needs to be shut down.
[1:13:34.180 --> 1:13:35.580]  And that'd be a good start.
[1:13:35.580 --> 1:13:40.260]  And if you want to bring them back, maybe, but I think you just shut them down.
[1:13:40.260 --> 1:13:41.420]  They're so out of control.
[1:13:41.420 --> 1:13:43.700]  Our government's out of control.
[1:13:43.700 --> 1:13:45.060]  The government's way too big.
[1:13:45.060 --> 1:13:46.700]  It's hostile against the American people.
[1:13:46.700 --> 1:13:47.700]  I'm done with it.
[1:13:47.700 --> 1:13:49.460]  The American people are done with it.
[1:13:49.460 --> 1:13:51.300]  And they know their time is short.
[1:13:51.300 --> 1:13:57.340]  That's why they're threatening people who call out the corrupt leadership.
[1:13:57.340 --> 1:14:02.780]  Now this is how you do it, because they're not going to just abolish themselves.
[1:14:02.780 --> 1:14:07.740]  And our Congress is filled with a bunch of wussbags.
[1:14:07.740 --> 1:14:09.260]  So they're not going to do it either.
[1:14:09.260 --> 1:14:10.260]  So this is how you're going to have to do it.
[1:14:10.260 --> 1:14:12.300]  You're going to have to do it at the state level.
[1:14:12.300 --> 1:14:17.300]  Governor Republicans censure rogue FBI days after a Mar-a-Lago raid, call on state of
[1:14:17.300 --> 1:14:19.940]  Arizona to end cooperation with the FBI.
[1:14:19.940 --> 1:14:20.940]  Boom.
[1:14:20.940 --> 1:14:23.660]  That's how it's done.
[1:14:23.660 --> 1:14:25.660]  Texas is probably not going to take this leadership role.
[1:14:25.660 --> 1:14:27.820]  Greg Abbott is too weak.
[1:14:27.820 --> 1:14:32.420]  But I can see Florida, and if Lake becomes the governor of Arizona, I can see Lake doing
[1:14:32.420 --> 1:14:33.420]  this.
[1:14:33.420 --> 1:14:35.540]  And then maybe Texas would follow.
[1:14:35.540 --> 1:14:37.620]  Governor Abbott, he's a follower.
[1:14:37.620 --> 1:14:38.620]  He's not a leader.
[1:14:38.620 --> 1:14:39.620]  He's a follower.
[1:14:39.620 --> 1:14:47.300]  So if the leaders like DeSantis and Lake declare that, you know what, any federal government,
[1:14:47.300 --> 1:14:53.980]  no longer, any federal government institution, no longer has any jurisdiction in my state.
[1:14:53.980 --> 1:14:54.980]  Sorry.
[1:14:54.980 --> 1:14:56.980]  FBI, DOJ, IRS, no.
[1:14:56.980 --> 1:14:57.980]  Nope.
[1:14:57.980 --> 1:14:58.980]  Sorry.
[1:14:58.980 --> 1:14:59.980]  No jurisdiction here.
[1:14:59.980 --> 1:15:00.980]  You're not allowed here.
[1:15:00.980 --> 1:15:03.900]  You don't have any rights here.
[1:15:03.900 --> 1:15:07.500]  And that's how you do it.
[1:15:07.500 --> 1:15:12.220]  Governor Republicans call on the state of Arizona to end cooperation with the FBI.
[1:15:12.220 --> 1:15:13.700]  That's how it's done.
[1:15:13.700 --> 1:15:16.260]  You want to protect your constituents.
[1:15:16.260 --> 1:15:18.940]  You want to protect the citizens of your state.
[1:15:18.940 --> 1:15:24.780]  Protect them from this rogue criminal out of control federal government.
[1:15:24.780 --> 1:15:28.500]  That's how it needs to be done.
[1:15:28.500 --> 1:15:33.140]  There needs to be mass arrests happening.
[1:15:33.140 --> 1:15:38.820]  There need to be people being walked out in shackles for what's being done at the FBI
[1:15:38.820 --> 1:15:42.580]  and what's being done at the Department of Justice.
[1:15:42.580 --> 1:15:45.060]  But that might be a pipe dream.
[1:15:45.060 --> 1:15:51.500]  So our best hope is that state governments will say, FBI, IRS, DOJ, you no longer can
[1:15:51.500 --> 1:15:53.140]  operate here.
[1:15:53.140 --> 1:15:55.540]  But that's just the beginning of the corruption.
[1:15:55.540 --> 1:16:19.540]  Wait until you see what's next from the Mar-a-Lago raid.
[1:16:19.540 --> 1:16:27.180]  We told you energy and food prices would explode, and now they're up more than 40% of the U.S.
[1:16:27.180 --> 1:16:28.180]  alone.
[1:16:28.180 --> 1:16:30.100]  Some areas of the world are up over 100%.

[1:20:23.300 --> 1:20:30.980]  It's so dangerous how corrupt our government has become, and it's not just hard to believe
[1:20:30.980 --> 1:20:36.740]  the extreme levels of corruption at the FBI, the DOJ, the IRS, and the White House.
[1:20:36.740 --> 1:20:40.580]  It's just as hard to believe that there's almost no resistance, like nobody wants to
[1:20:40.580 --> 1:20:45.980]  stop this, like we have a small handful of Congress members that are willing to speak
[1:20:45.980 --> 1:20:52.660]  out against this corruption, nobody in the military, I mean most people in media don't
[1:20:52.660 --> 1:20:55.620]  even want to address it, there's just a small handful of people in media that want to address
[1:20:55.620 --> 1:21:00.980]  this, I mean this is just shocking stuff.
[1:21:00.980 --> 1:21:04.660]  The Department of Justice threatening federal agents that blow the whistle on corruption?
[1:21:04.660 --> 1:21:08.940]  I mean come on, do you not see where this goes?
[1:21:08.940 --> 1:21:15.020]  Do you not see how dangerous this is?
[1:21:15.020 --> 1:21:17.900]  And here's what they do.
[1:21:17.900 --> 1:21:22.460]  They set up the false flags, they set up the false narratives so that they can claim to
[1:21:22.460 --> 1:21:31.380]  be the victim and assume more power as their hour of corruption is on full display.
[1:21:31.380 --> 1:21:35.140]  Why doesn't the DOJ want federal agents blowing the whistle?
[1:21:35.140 --> 1:21:37.140]  Because they know what they're doing is illegal.
[1:21:37.140 --> 1:21:42.900]  Why does the Boston Children's Hospital erase all the documents about the trans kid surgeries
[1:21:42.900 --> 1:21:45.300]  and erase all their videos about the trans kid surgeries?
[1:21:45.300 --> 1:21:47.580]  Because they know what they're doing is child abuse.
[1:21:47.580 --> 1:21:51.860]  They don't want you to know what they're doing, but they want to be able to do it in public
[1:21:51.860 --> 1:21:55.180]  so that you just assume it's okay, but then when you point it out and you say, hey, that's
[1:21:55.180 --> 1:21:59.500]  not okay, they say, wait a second, we're not even doing this, because they know it's criminal.
[1:21:59.500 --> 1:22:05.100]  They're abusing children and they're using the government in authoritarian, totalitarian
[1:22:05.100 --> 1:22:06.660]  ways.
[1:22:06.660 --> 1:22:11.060]  And we just sit here and take it because our Congress is so pathetic, our media is so
[1:22:11.060 --> 1:22:18.780]  pathetic, and quite frankly the average American person is so pathetic.
[1:22:18.780 --> 1:22:24.820]  And truths, sad truths, so they set themselves up at the victim.
[1:22:24.820 --> 1:22:29.180]  Bomb threat at Boston Children's Hospital was a false alarm, police say.
[1:22:29.180 --> 1:22:31.940]  Oh, you don't say, they probably bomb threat themselves.
[1:22:31.940 --> 1:22:35.700]  Probably one of those liberal doctors that chops little kid's weenies off and chops
[1:22:35.700 --> 1:22:39.700]  little girl's breasts off, probably one of those doctors that called in a fake bomb threat
[1:22:39.700 --> 1:22:41.540]  to say, see, I'm the victim.
[1:22:41.540 --> 1:22:48.180]  Now bring in more kids for me to slaughter, bring in more kids for me to chop up, bring
[1:22:48.180 --> 1:22:51.140]  in more kids for me to slice and dice.
[1:22:51.140 --> 1:22:56.100]  I'm a liberal and I'm here to slaughter your baby.
[1:22:56.100 --> 1:22:59.220]  And then when you call it out, they erase the documents, they erase the videos and they
[1:22:59.220 --> 1:23:04.420]  say, we never did this, in fact, you're lying about us and now we're getting bomb threats.
[1:23:04.420 --> 1:23:09.180]  These people are unreal in their evil.
[1:23:09.180 --> 1:23:15.020]  They're unreal in their lying and their fraud and their corruption.
[1:23:15.020 --> 1:23:18.380]  And they're disdain towards humanity.
[1:23:18.380 --> 1:23:21.140]  FBI does the same thing.
[1:23:21.140 --> 1:23:25.620]  The Daily Beast today, FBI is facing unprecedented mega threats.
[1:23:25.620 --> 1:23:26.700]  Oh, what?
[1:23:26.700 --> 1:23:31.780]  A bunch of federal agents go online and post anonymous accounts threatening the FBI.
[1:23:31.780 --> 1:23:37.380]  Oh, oh, like a bunch of federal agents pretend to kidnap Governor Whitmer, try to pretend
[1:23:37.380 --> 1:23:41.740]  to kidnap Governor Northam, go out on January 6th inciting violence, telling people to go
[1:23:41.740 --> 1:23:45.100]  into the Capitol, unbelievable levels of corruption.
[1:23:45.100 --> 1:23:52.980]  This is the most dangerous time in this country's history, perhaps even the world.
[1:23:52.980 --> 1:23:58.060]  If the American government becomes this authoritarian and this corrupt folks, it's over.
[1:23:58.060 --> 1:23:59.900]  Forget about it.
[1:23:59.900 --> 1:24:00.900]  Forget about it.
[1:24:00.900 --> 1:24:05.300]  America is the last bastion of hope and freedom and independence and prosperity that this
[1:24:05.300 --> 1:24:06.780]  planet has to offer.
[1:24:06.780 --> 1:24:10.980]  And if it goes away, it's done.
[1:24:10.980 --> 1:24:13.060]  It's over.
[1:24:13.060 --> 1:24:17.300]  And that's why the globalists are so intent on destroying America right now.
[1:24:17.300 --> 1:24:23.260]  That's why you see all the operations so hardcore in America right now.
[1:24:23.260 --> 1:24:26.660]  So they false flagged themselves, oh, we're getting threatened.
[1:24:26.660 --> 1:24:30.780]  They threatened themselves, it's false flagged, whether it's the Boston Children's Hospital
[1:24:30.780 --> 1:24:35.580]  or whether it's the FBI, it's them doing it to themselves so that they can cry victim
[1:24:35.580 --> 1:24:37.700]  in their time of exposure.
[1:24:37.700 --> 1:24:43.220]  And then they threaten employees who dare go public with the corruption.
[1:24:43.220 --> 1:24:46.500]  But then you've got the Mar-a-Lago raid, and everybody involved in that needs to be in
[1:24:46.500 --> 1:24:47.780]  jail.
[1:24:47.780 --> 1:24:52.340]  But they won't because they're Democrats.
[1:24:52.340 --> 1:25:00.380]  So they just released a photo from inside Mar-a-Lago, folks, this is so ridiculous, again, it's
[1:25:00.380 --> 1:25:03.300]  hard to even fathom that this is the reality that we live in right now.
[1:25:03.300 --> 1:25:05.260]  It's hard to fathom how corrupt our government is.
[1:25:05.260 --> 1:25:08.700]  It's hard to fathom how big of liars our politicians are.
[1:25:08.700 --> 1:25:14.700]  So you've got Eric Swalwell, you've got Liz Cheney, you've got other members of the establishment,
[1:25:14.700 --> 1:25:18.140]  the corrupt American regime.
[1:25:18.140 --> 1:25:25.900]  Putting out a photo that gets leaked, how convenient, of the Mar-a-Lago raid where it's all the
[1:25:25.900 --> 1:25:32.300]  top secret documents laid out on a floor at Mar-a-Lago and then the boxes of pictures
[1:25:32.300 --> 1:25:33.300]  that they took.
[1:25:33.300 --> 1:25:34.300]  It's pictures.
[1:25:34.300 --> 1:25:38.540]  Donald Trump has framed magazine covers of Time Magazine and other stuff and frames that
[1:25:38.540 --> 1:25:40.820]  they took and they put in boxes too.
[1:25:40.820 --> 1:25:49.060]  Oh my gosh, guys, the stuff that Donald Trump took from the White House at Mar-a-Lago is
[1:25:49.060 --> 1:25:54.980]  so secretive that they're publishing it on the Internet.
[1:25:54.980 --> 1:26:00.140]  It's such a crime, the documents that Donald Trump has that they're taking pictures of them
[1:26:00.140 --> 1:26:03.620]  for the American people to see.
[1:26:03.620 --> 1:26:09.140]  I mean, talk about a fraud.
[1:26:09.140 --> 1:26:12.500]  Talk about desperation.
[1:26:12.500 --> 1:26:14.420]  Why didn't they release this originally?
[1:26:14.420 --> 1:26:16.820]  Because they're losing now.
[1:26:16.820 --> 1:26:19.820]  They've lost the Mar-a-Lago narrative.
[1:26:19.820 --> 1:26:24.060]  So now they're putting up these secrets, these pictures of secret documents supposedly and
[1:26:24.060 --> 1:26:25.660]  they're saying, look, this is what Trump had.
[1:26:25.660 --> 1:26:29.460]  Well, then why are you putting pictures out of their secret?
[1:26:29.460 --> 1:26:32.500]  You redacted the whole affidavit that you said Trump was afraid for people to see, you were
[1:26:32.500 --> 1:26:33.500]  afraid for people to see it.
[1:26:33.500 --> 1:26:35.900]  You lied about that too.
[1:26:35.900 --> 1:26:44.660]  And then the nerve of Eric Swalwell, the guy caught with a Chinese spy, he says, these
[1:26:44.660 --> 1:26:46.460]  are the secrets that protect our troops.
[1:26:46.460 --> 1:26:48.740]  Really, you just published them on Twitter.
[1:26:48.740 --> 1:26:52.220]  Either you want them protected, really, you just published them on Twitter or believe
[1:26:52.220 --> 1:26:56.980]  they should be in the hands of a corrupt man who has used U.S. resources before to help
[1:26:56.980 --> 1:26:57.980]  himself.
[1:26:57.980 --> 1:27:01.940]  Eric, we're still waiting for you to produce the evidence of Russian collusion that you
[1:27:01.940 --> 1:27:05.660]  claimed you had multiple times during congressional hearings.
[1:27:05.660 --> 1:27:08.060]  You claimed you had the proof of Russian collusion.
[1:27:08.060 --> 1:27:09.620]  We haven't seen that yet, Eric.
[1:27:09.620 --> 1:27:11.140]  So you lied about that too.
[1:27:11.140 --> 1:27:14.900]  You're a dirty, rotten, no good liar and everyone knows it.
[1:27:14.900 --> 1:27:17.140]  But then he just reaches for new levels of insanity.
[1:27:17.140 --> 1:27:19.860]  He says, are you with the troops or Trump?
[1:27:19.860 --> 1:27:25.660]  I'm sick and tired of liberal Democrats getting to wave the American flag like their patriots
[1:27:25.660 --> 1:27:28.660]  whenever it's convenient for them.
[1:27:28.660 --> 1:27:33.700]  The American Democrat Party has destroyed our military.
[1:27:33.700 --> 1:27:37.020]  They've let out top secrets of our military.
[1:27:37.020 --> 1:27:41.380]  Hillary Clinton has released top secrets.
[1:27:41.380 --> 1:27:45.620]  They allowed top secrets to get confiscated because of the fallout after Afghanistan and
[1:27:45.620 --> 1:27:47.700]  the pullout.
[1:27:47.700 --> 1:27:49.900]  They're the ones that kneel for the flag.
[1:27:49.900 --> 1:27:52.780]  They're the ones that tell you how bad and racist America is.
[1:27:52.780 --> 1:27:54.220]  They're the haters of America.
[1:27:54.220 --> 1:27:56.300]  They're the ones destroying the American way of life.
[1:27:56.300 --> 1:27:59.060]  They're the ones wiping their ass with the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[1:27:59.060 --> 1:28:02.980]  But then whenever it's convenient for them, they act like they're the American patriots.
[1:28:02.980 --> 1:28:05.220]  Oh, now Eric Swalwell cares about America.
[1:28:05.220 --> 1:28:08.980]  Oh, Eric Swalwell is the American patriot, not Donald Trump.
[1:28:08.980 --> 1:28:10.540]  What a BS lie.
[1:28:10.540 --> 1:28:11.540]  What is it, Democrats?
[1:28:11.540 --> 1:28:14.460]  Do you hate America or do you love America?
[1:28:14.460 --> 1:28:15.540]  Make up your mind.
[1:28:15.540 --> 1:28:16.900]  We all know what it is.
[1:28:16.900 --> 1:28:18.140]  We all know you hate America.
[1:28:18.140 --> 1:28:19.700]  We all know you hate the American people.
[1:28:19.700 --> 1:28:24.020]  So why do you wave the American flag and claim to stand for the troops whenever it's convenient
[1:28:24.020 --> 1:28:26.220]  for you?
[1:28:26.220 --> 1:28:27.220]  That's obnoxious.
[1:28:27.220 --> 1:28:32.820]  But oh my gosh, the top secret moralago documents, oh, they're so top secret that they're now
[1:28:32.820 --> 1:28:33.820]  sharing them.
[1:28:33.820 --> 1:28:37.420]  Eric Swalwell is now publishing pictures of them on the Internet saying how top secret
[1:28:37.420 --> 1:28:38.420]  they are.
[1:28:38.420 --> 1:28:43.220]  But you know, it's funny because when we had Hillary Clinton's emails and they said top
[1:28:43.220 --> 1:28:47.060]  secret on them and those got leaked and we had them and they all said top secret and
[1:28:47.060 --> 1:28:50.460]  confidential and everything, they didn't care then, did they?
[1:28:50.460 --> 1:28:53.980]  They didn't care about Hillary Clinton's secret email servers that she smashed up and all
[1:28:53.980 --> 1:28:55.140]  the confidential stuff.
[1:28:55.140 --> 1:28:58.780]  They didn't care about that.
[1:28:58.780 --> 1:29:03.540]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular
[1:29:03.540 --> 1:29:07.140]  system, for your brain, for every part of your body.
[1:29:07.140 --> 1:29:15.540]  But what I don't see being promoted is the fact that it has natural psychotropic effects.
[1:29:15.540 --> 1:29:16.540]  It certainly does for me.
[1:29:16.540 --> 1:29:21.340]  When I take a couple of these capsules from an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are
[1:29:21.340 --> 1:29:22.340]  amazing.
[1:29:22.340 --> 1:29:28.780]  Now, there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain.

[1:30:57.860 --> 1:31:04.060]  We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what
[1:31:04.060 --> 1:31:06.460]  we've known and what's to come.
[1:31:06.460 --> 1:31:11.740]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is, don't panic.
[1:31:11.740 --> 1:31:17.100]  Stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto
[1:31:17.100 --> 1:31:19.300]  a safe sound course.
[1:31:19.300 --> 1:31:25.060]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building our own
[1:31:25.060 --> 1:31:26.180]  society.
[1:31:26.180 --> 1:31:31.740]  All we got to do is survive the crash and right now we still have time to prepare.
[1:31:31.740 --> 1:31:35.980]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[1:31:35.980 --> 1:31:42.340]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water and survival gear to
[1:31:42.340 --> 1:31:44.780]  keep us strong and at the ready.
[1:31:44.780 --> 1:31:52.460]  Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials, storable foods, water filtration, first aid,
[1:31:52.460 --> 1:31:56.460]  power and more at preparedtoday.com.
[1:31:56.460 --> 1:32:01.940]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer or
[1:32:01.940 --> 1:32:04.260]  rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire.
[1:32:04.260 --> 1:32:09.060]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles, you see it every year, 30 different
[1:32:09.060 --> 1:32:14.060]  tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers and almost
[1:32:14.060 --> 1:32:19.500]  all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups because
[1:32:19.500 --> 1:32:23.060]  they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this
[1:32:23.060 --> 1:32:24.060]  and knowing this.
[1:32:24.060 --> 1:32:29.500]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[1:32:29.500 --> 1:32:34.780]  to be able to do things tax-wise that's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of
[1:32:34.780 --> 1:32:35.780]  your money.
[1:32:35.780 --> 1:32:40.500]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[1:32:40.500 --> 1:32:47.660]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com
[1:32:47.660 --> 1:32:54.660]  or call 833-900-4285.
[1:32:54.660 --> 1:32:59.580]  Why?
[1:32:59.580 --> 1:33:13.140]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:13.140 --> 1:33:19.600]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[1:33:19.600 --> 1:33:20.580]  the Infowar.
[1:33:20.580 --> 1:33:23.740]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:33:23.740 --> 1:33:28.620]  So the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Democrat Party all know what they're doing.
[1:33:28.620 --> 1:33:29.620]  Quite frankly, it's treason.
[1:33:29.620 --> 1:33:32.100]  It's just all treason.
[1:33:32.100 --> 1:33:36.700]  And so they're threatening employees that blow the whistle and they're going to the
[1:33:36.700 --> 1:33:40.940]  media and they're saying, hey, don't talk about this, don't cover this, censor this.
[1:33:40.940 --> 1:33:41.940]  It's Russian disinformation.
[1:33:41.940 --> 1:33:42.940]  No, it's the truth.
[1:33:42.940 --> 1:33:46.240]  They just claim it's Russian disinformation because they don't want you to know the truth
[1:33:46.240 --> 1:33:50.300]  about the treason that they're currently involved in.
[1:33:50.300 --> 1:33:51.780]  It's just unprecedented, folks.
[1:33:51.780 --> 1:34:00.180]  It's truly unprecedented and it's soul crushing that we don't have a louder, stronger, bigger
[1:34:00.180 --> 1:34:02.580]  resistance against this.
[1:34:02.580 --> 1:34:07.660]  And that innocent people, there's all kinds of innocent people rotting in jails right
[1:34:07.660 --> 1:34:13.420]  now, but I mean, let's talk about the political nature of it, nonviolent innocent people,
[1:34:13.420 --> 1:34:18.820]  January 6th defendants rotting away in jail cells right now, veterans rotting away in
[1:34:18.820 --> 1:34:24.180]  jail cells right now, grandparents, doctors rotting away in jail cells right now because
[1:34:24.180 --> 1:34:32.860]  of the Democrat Party needs their political prisoners to add ammunition to their narrative
[1:34:32.860 --> 1:34:37.460]  that Trump supporters are the bad guys when they know they're the real terrorists, they're
[1:34:37.460 --> 1:34:38.860]  the real bad guys.
[1:34:38.860 --> 1:34:42.900]  So they have to arrest all their opposition to say, see, we told you they're the bad guys.
[1:34:42.900 --> 1:34:48.780]  Meanwhile, everything they're doing is an act of war against America, sabotaging our communications,
[1:34:48.780 --> 1:34:51.980]  sabotaging our energy.
[1:34:51.980 --> 1:34:58.740]  And then the real criminals in the Democrat Party and the FBI get to walk free.
[1:34:58.740 --> 1:35:03.780]  Break your heart, break your heart, crushes your soul that this is how corrupt our country
[1:35:03.780 --> 1:35:10.700]  is and there's barely any resistance, there's barely any noise to shut this down.
[1:35:10.700 --> 1:35:14.340]  Small handful of people in the media, small handful of people in Congress and now the
[1:35:14.340 --> 1:35:19.460]  Department of Justice is threatening government officials who blow the whistle on corruption.
[1:35:19.460 --> 1:35:22.020]  Folks, these are dark times for this country.
[1:35:22.020 --> 1:35:27.900]  And if we don't turn it around fast, you're going to see corruption and darkness and evil,
[1:35:27.900 --> 1:35:30.700]  the likes of which you never thought you would.
[1:35:30.700 --> 1:35:34.220]  And those two faces that you just had on the screen, Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy,
[1:35:34.220 --> 1:35:37.060]  you are just as guilty as anyone else.
[1:35:37.060 --> 1:35:45.340]  Your complete abstention from any action on this is guilt.
[1:35:45.340 --> 1:35:52.420]  The fact that those two are such pieces of trash politicians that they can't call out
[1:35:52.420 --> 1:35:54.780]  the corruption of the FBI, the DOJ, the Democrat Party.
[1:35:54.780 --> 1:36:02.340]  Instead, they sit in silence and do nothing like wussbags and cowards and squishies.
[1:36:02.340 --> 1:36:06.340]  Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy are an embarrassment.
[1:36:06.340 --> 1:36:12.620]  They are an embarrassment and they are a pathetic excuse for a man, a pathetic excuse
[1:36:12.620 --> 1:36:15.100]  for men, Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy.
[1:36:15.100 --> 1:36:18.700]  You two suck.
[1:36:18.700 --> 1:36:25.620]  Everybody should be emailing Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell right now, do something.
[1:36:25.620 --> 1:36:28.520]  Do something about the FBI corruption.
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:30.780]  Do something about the DOJ corruption.
[1:36:30.780 --> 1:36:33.700]  Do something to protect the FBI whistleblowers.
[1:36:33.700 --> 1:36:37.580]  Do something to release the political prisoners of the Democrat Party.
[1:36:37.580 --> 1:36:42.620]  Do something to address the Biden crime family because Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy
[1:36:42.620 --> 1:36:51.660]  have done nothing, nothing.
[1:36:51.660 --> 1:36:56.140]  I've got other news to cover and we've got a guest coming up, Sarah Gonzalez from The
[1:36:56.140 --> 1:37:04.580]  Blaze, but this is everything, folks, and as big as all the other news on my desk is
[1:37:04.580 --> 1:37:11.300]  with the vaccines and the crime waves and our military being shut down and the sexual
[1:37:11.300 --> 1:37:15.620]  grooming of the children in the classrooms and our infrastructure failing.
[1:37:15.620 --> 1:37:16.620]  That's all big stuff.
[1:37:16.620 --> 1:37:21.380]  Those are all big developments, but this right here is bigger than all of it.
[1:37:21.380 --> 1:37:26.580]  The corruption at the FBI, the corruption at the DOJ, the corruption of the Democrat
[1:37:26.580 --> 1:37:33.060]  Party is death for freedom, death for America, and death for prosperity.
[1:37:33.060 --> 1:37:34.060]  It's all of it.
[1:37:34.060 --> 1:37:36.620]  It's all done.
[1:37:36.620 --> 1:37:40.820]  So every, all the other stuff is just the trickle down.
[1:37:40.820 --> 1:37:44.660]  All the other stuff, the infrastructure failing, the military failing, the sexual grooming of
[1:37:44.660 --> 1:37:47.060]  the children, the crime waves, all of it.
[1:37:47.060 --> 1:37:50.380]  That's all trickle down of this right here.
[1:37:50.380 --> 1:37:56.780]  The corruption at the government at the very top, that's the problem here.
[1:37:56.780 --> 1:38:00.700]  And we don't even have strong enough leadership to even address it.
[1:38:00.700 --> 1:38:09.060]  A mouse, a mouse in a church makes more noise than Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy.
[1:38:09.060 --> 1:38:14.500]  I have baby frogs in my backyard that make more of a racket than Mitch McConnell and
[1:38:14.500 --> 1:38:21.020]  Kevin McCarthy dealing with political prisoners and Democrat Party corruption.
[1:38:21.020 --> 1:38:29.820]  I'd rather have a can of spam as the leaders of the Republican Party.
[1:38:29.820 --> 1:38:33.380]  That might be a little more effective than Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy.
[1:38:33.380 --> 1:38:38.820]  A can of spam or maybe like a tube of toothpaste or something.
[1:38:38.820 --> 1:38:41.700]  Anything, anything is about the same.
[1:38:41.700 --> 1:38:47.340]  The effectiveness of Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell is about as equal to an empty cup
[1:38:47.340 --> 1:38:52.860]  of coffee, an empty mug, it is just worthless.
[1:38:52.860 --> 1:38:55.980]  That's Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, completely worthless doing nothing.
[1:38:55.980 --> 1:39:01.420]  So I got all these videos, I got all these news stories, but it's like if we don't address
[1:39:01.420 --> 1:39:07.020]  this, if we can't stop the most obvious political corruption that we've ever seen in this history,
[1:39:07.020 --> 1:39:09.340]  the history of this country, then nothing else matters.
[1:39:09.340 --> 1:39:11.660]  They'll sexualize the kids, they'll groom the kids, they'll rape the kids.
[1:39:11.660 --> 1:39:15.780]  In the classroom, they'll chop off their breasts, they'll chop off their weenies, they'll shut
[1:39:15.780 --> 1:39:20.740]  down our military, they'll shut down our infrastructure, they'll force you to get a poisonous vaccine.
[1:39:20.740 --> 1:39:23.460]  It all trickles down from this right here.
[1:39:23.460 --> 1:39:27.340]  The fact that we won't be honest about how corrupt our government is, the fact that we
[1:39:27.340 --> 1:39:31.740]  can't be real about how corrupt our government is, and the fact that the real criminals in
[1:39:31.740 --> 1:39:37.100]  this country are yet to be brought to justice, it's only going to get worse.
[1:39:37.100 --> 1:39:42.100]  It only gets worse until this is addressed right here.
[1:39:42.100 --> 1:39:46.340]  How they're able to get away with the criminal raid at Mar-a-Lago.
[1:39:46.340 --> 1:39:50.820]  How they're able to get away with threatening federal officials who blow the whistle on
[1:39:50.820 --> 1:39:53.260]  government corruption.
[1:39:53.260 --> 1:39:58.300]  If that is not addressed, it's over folks, it's just, it's game over for you, it's game
[1:39:58.300 --> 1:40:01.380]  over for this country.
[1:40:01.380 --> 1:40:05.100]  It's just game over, man.
[1:40:05.100 --> 1:40:08.660]  When you sit there and you look at Mitch McConnell and Ken McCarthy and you just say, why are
[1:40:08.660 --> 1:40:12.220]  you doing this to us?
[1:40:12.220 --> 1:40:14.500]  Why are you letting us be destroyed?
[1:40:14.500 --> 1:40:18.020]  Why are you letting our country get raped and pillaged and plundered?
[1:40:18.020 --> 1:40:20.020]  Why?
[1:40:20.020 --> 1:40:23.020]  Are you, are you getting paid off?
[1:40:23.020 --> 1:40:25.500]  Are you actually a Democrat posing as Republican?
[1:40:25.500 --> 1:40:28.140]  Or are you really that pathetic?
[1:40:28.140 --> 1:40:33.220]  Are you really that much of a sad excuse for a human being?
[1:40:33.220 --> 1:40:38.300]  Or maybe you guys are too busy getting monkey pox with one another.
[1:40:38.300 --> 1:40:43.300]  So I'm going to get to the other news coming up here shortly, but it's everything folks,
[1:40:43.300 --> 1:40:44.300]  it's everything.
[1:40:44.300 --> 1:40:49.340]  And you know it, I know it, everybody knows it, until we address the corruption at the
[1:40:49.340 --> 1:40:54.500]  top highest levels of our government, the double standards, all of it, the hypocrisies,
[1:40:54.500 --> 1:41:00.060]  the treason, until it's addressed, nothing else will be addressed, nothing, nothing.
[1:41:00.060 --> 1:41:05.420]  And your country will continue to spiral out of control and into a third world country.
[1:41:05.420 --> 1:41:09.780]  So, so does anyone in Congress want to start taking this seriously?
[1:41:09.780 --> 1:41:11.900]  Do people in media want to start taking this seriously?
[1:41:11.900 --> 1:41:13.580]  Does anybody want to start taking this seriously?
[1:41:13.580 --> 1:41:17.940]  Or is it just going to be the same small handful of folks in media and government that are
[1:41:17.940 --> 1:41:19.860]  actually taking this seriously?
[1:41:19.860 --> 1:41:23.460]  And sadly, it's just to a point where we're just, we're just basically doing play by play
[1:41:23.460 --> 1:41:29.180]  commentary on the fall of America, because nobody will take serious action.
[1:41:29.180 --> 1:41:30.180]  We get arrested.
[1:41:30.180 --> 1:41:31.180]  We get censored.
[1:41:31.180 --> 1:41:32.180]  We get shut down.
[1:41:32.180 --> 1:41:33.180]  We get lied about.
[1:41:33.180 --> 1:41:34.180]  We're political prisoners.
[1:41:34.180 --> 1:41:35.180]  We're politically persecuted.
[1:41:35.180 --> 1:41:39.020]  I mean, we're at the front lines and it's just like, okay, we're bleeding out.
[1:41:39.020 --> 1:41:44.300]  What's almost done, anybody want to come help?
[1:41:44.300 --> 1:41:48.620]  Forget about info wars, bloody corpse, bleeding out on the battlefield about to die.
[1:41:48.620 --> 1:41:49.620]  Forget about that.
[1:41:49.620 --> 1:41:53.740]  The country's about to die.
[1:41:53.740 --> 1:41:57.740]  Now we are still on air every day and of course that angers the Democrat Party.
[1:41:57.740 --> 1:42:02.260]  They throw fits of rage that they haven't shut us down yet.
[1:42:02.260 --> 1:42:07.220]  Fits of rage from the globalists that we're not off air yet, but we're still here thanks
[1:42:07.220 --> 1:42:08.980]  to your support at infowarstore.com.
[1:42:08.980 --> 1:42:14.020]  So continue to shop at infowarstore.com and we will continue to be the tip of the spear
[1:42:14.020 --> 1:42:19.260]  fighting against government corruption, fighting against mainstream media lies, fighting against
[1:42:19.260 --> 1:42:23.340]  everything that's now come to fruition that we've been warning about for decades.
[1:42:23.340 --> 1:42:25.700]  You shopping at infowarstore.com keeps us on the air.
[1:42:25.700 --> 1:42:31.860]  The big sales happening right now just a few days left to get 50% off on DNA force plus
[1:42:31.860 --> 1:42:36.420]  and 40% off on ultimate fish oil.
[1:42:36.420 --> 1:42:40.420]  So just five days left on those two big sales.
[1:42:40.420 --> 1:42:44.700]  These are products that go out of stock quite frequently because they're so popular and
[1:42:44.700 --> 1:42:45.700]  so effective.
[1:42:45.700 --> 1:42:51.580]  So 50% off DNA force plus 40% off ultimate fish oil, but only five days left on that
[1:42:51.580 --> 1:42:58.740]  sale at infowarstore.com.
[1:42:58.740 --> 1:43:02.460]  People say Alex Jones is crazy, he's a conspiracy theory guy, he's a nutcase, he's got these
[1:43:02.460 --> 1:43:05.180]  rants and all that.
[1:43:05.180 --> 1:43:11.820]  What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal,
[1:43:11.820 --> 1:43:12.820]  not noise.
[1:43:12.820 --> 1:43:19.100]  If you look at the signal and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC and we'll do what
[1:43:19.100 --> 1:43:24.500]  Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there, and if
[1:43:24.500 --> 1:43:28.220]  you're a sentient human being and just watching it and you say, well, Alex Jones is ahead
[1:43:28.220 --> 1:43:33.300]  of this, not only that, he kind of explained it, you are one of the great thinkers of this.
[1:43:33.300 --> 1:43:34.300]  That is very rare.
[1:43:34.300 --> 1:43:38.380]  You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[1:43:38.380 --> 1:43:41.660]  In this new book, I've got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this
[1:43:41.660 --> 1:43:45.380]  thing, I go, this is it, this is no beetry.
[1:43:45.380 --> 1:43:47.860]  You're not going to be flipping pages here, you're going to be having a pin out, you're
[1:43:47.860 --> 1:43:49.860]  going to be underlying stuff.
[1:43:49.860 --> 1:43:52.300]  The Great Reset by Alex Jones.
[1:43:52.300 --> 1:43:58.580]  Order your copy now at Amazon or infowarstore.com.
[1:43:58.580 --> 1:44:03.620]  Seven months ago, in December of 2021, we launched the first in the three-coin founding
[1:44:03.620 --> 1:44:06.980]  member series, George Washington, Slaying the Dragon.
[1:44:06.980 --> 1:44:11.140]  Then, we launched the Tree of Liberty coin and finally, the second amendment, come and
[1:44:11.140 --> 1:44:13.140]  take it, Molan Lobby coin.
[1:44:13.140 --> 1:44:23.940]  There are only 75 coins left in the three-coin series, exclusively, right now, at 1776point.com.
[1:44:23.940 --> 1:44:28.700]  For the final 75 people to become founding members for this big project, we're launching
[1:44:28.700 --> 1:44:34.180]  in the near future, you'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made of the sheepdog
[1:44:34.180 --> 1:44:36.140]  chasing the wolf in a personal message.
[1:44:36.140 --> 1:44:42.900]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776point.com.
[1:44:42.900 --> 1:44:48.340]  This is history happening now, infowarstore support is changing the world and this is
[1:44:48.340 --> 1:44:58.180]  the final 75 three-coin set, exclusively available at 1776point.com.
[1:44:58.180 --> 1:45:05.140]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here and that's
[1:45:05.140 --> 1:45:09.860]  what people recognize and resonate with and as Ward said, you're not going to find a better
[1:45:09.860 --> 1:45:11.940]  place for information.
[1:45:11.940 --> 1:45:15.300]  You might not agree with everything, you might not agree with all our perspectives, but we
[1:45:15.300 --> 1:45:19.940]  cover all the information and there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[1:45:19.940 --> 1:45:21.260]  Thank you for that Ward.
[1:45:21.260 --> 1:45:25.580]  Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, infowarsstore.com is where to
[1:45:25.580 --> 1:45:28.540]  get them folks and we do have the best supplements.
[1:45:28.540 --> 1:45:34.980]  Just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, we do the best with our
[1:45:34.980 --> 1:45:37.260]  supplements as well.
[1:45:37.260 --> 1:45:40.860]  Look at the hair and beard support formula, folks, this is a joke.
[1:45:40.860 --> 1:45:45.460]  We're giving this thing away, it's 75% off, by the way, it works for me in case you haven't
[1:45:45.460 --> 1:45:46.460]  noticed.
[1:45:46.460 --> 1:45:50.060]  The hair and beard formula is working for me.
[1:45:50.060 --> 1:45:52.340]  Quite well, I might add.
[1:45:52.340 --> 1:45:56.940]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men, I go and see him quite
[1:45:56.940 --> 1:45:59.980]  often now.
[1:45:59.980 --> 1:46:04.220]  Sold out for more than a year and a half because of supply chain breakdowns.
[1:46:04.220 --> 1:46:08.620]  Our best selling product, Superblue, is finally back in stock.
[1:46:08.620 --> 1:46:14.260]  The original available at infowarsstore.com, it only came in three weeks ago and already
[1:46:14.260 --> 1:46:19.260]  half of our stock has sold out, so thank you all for the support, but Superblue has a lot
[1:46:19.260 --> 1:46:24.780]  of fans and you can get it for 40% off by itself, but when you get it in the trifecta
[1:46:24.780 --> 1:46:29.660]  with our activated charcoal toothpaste infused with essential oils, so great for your mouth
[1:46:29.660 --> 1:46:36.220]  and gums, you can get it for 50% off with super coral whitening toothpaste as well.
[1:46:36.220 --> 1:46:43.220]  So give the trifecta for 50% off together or 40% off individually at infowarsstore.com.
[1:46:43.220 --> 1:46:47.180]  You'll have great health with your gums and your mouth and your teeth and you know you're
[1:46:47.180 --> 1:46:50.860]  funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[1:46:50.860 --> 1:46:59.180]  Superblue being sold out for more than a year and a half, finally back available at infowarsstore.com.
[1:46:59.180 --> 1:47:06.180]  Feeding a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:52.180 --> 1:47:57.940]  but it's obviously real, you can't deny it, and so let's just be honest about it.
[1:47:57.940 --> 1:48:08.100]  The left wing ideology is all about human control, and it's going to take humans to
[1:48:08.100 --> 1:48:10.180]  control other humans.
[1:48:10.180 --> 1:48:14.300]  That's everything, that's the foundation, that's the root of everything that is the
[1:48:14.300 --> 1:48:18.740]  left wing ideology, is that humans need to be in control of other humans.
[1:48:18.740 --> 1:48:24.100]  So that's why the left needs you to be their subjects, they can't have you free, they can't
[1:48:24.100 --> 1:48:29.100]  have you independent, they can't have you in charge of yourself, they have to be in
[1:48:29.100 --> 1:48:33.780]  charge of you, whether it's health things, war things, it doesn't matter, they're in
[1:48:33.780 --> 1:48:39.260]  control of you, you the human can't be trusted so they have to control you.
[1:48:39.260 --> 1:48:46.940]  The right wing paradigm is self-government, you are in control of yourself, live and
[1:48:46.940 --> 1:48:50.700]  let others live.
[1:48:50.700 --> 1:48:55.740]  That's the basis of all of it, everything else is window dressing, everything else is
[1:48:55.740 --> 1:49:00.340]  political footballs being punted back and forth, that's the foundation, that's what
[1:49:00.340 --> 1:49:04.860]  people need to understand, comprehend and be honest about, because the left wing ideology
[1:49:04.860 --> 1:49:09.420]  will fail, just like it has failed throughout human history.
[1:49:09.420 --> 1:49:18.100]  Why do communists always end up in blood drenched civilizations because they try to control
[1:49:18.100 --> 1:49:23.540]  people, it fails, people don't want to be controlled, their control mechanisms fail
[1:49:23.540 --> 1:49:29.940]  and their leadership fails so people starve, people die, people go homeless, people lose
[1:49:29.940 --> 1:49:34.900]  everything and then they get mad at the people that tried to control them and did it all.
[1:49:34.900 --> 1:49:40.820]  Look at Mao Zedong, Lenin, Stalin, it doesn't matter, all left wing ideologies.
[1:49:40.820 --> 1:49:51.340]  You thought, you thought that humanity leaving the 20th century into the 21st century, you
[1:49:51.340 --> 1:49:56.300]  thought that's what we learned, I thought that's what we learned, communism, socialism,
[1:49:56.300 --> 1:50:04.960]  the left wing ideology fails, it fails and it results in death and misery, but apparently
[1:50:04.960 --> 1:50:08.260]  we didn't learn that and so I guess we ought to learn it again, don't we?
[1:50:08.260 --> 1:50:13.820]  And this time on a global scale, so how many people have to die now because of the left
[1:50:13.820 --> 1:50:16.380]  wing ideology trying to take over the globe?
[1:50:16.380 --> 1:50:22.500]  Well by their own numbers, eight billion, about eight, nine billion have to die so that the
[1:50:22.500 --> 1:50:25.900]  left wing ideology can finally have its pipe dream, I mean that's what it really comes
[1:50:25.900 --> 1:50:26.900]  down to.
[1:50:26.900 --> 1:50:34.380]  How do you really have your communist utopia, well you kill everyone, you have to kill everyone.
[1:50:34.380 --> 1:50:40.180]  So that's what people need to understand, forget about all the other fluff and window
[1:50:40.180 --> 1:50:44.020]  dressing and all the other stuff that happens.
[1:50:44.020 --> 1:50:48.620]  The basis of left wing ideology is humans have to be controlled by other humans.
[1:50:48.620 --> 1:50:52.940]  The basis of the right wing ideology is humans are in control of themselves.
[1:50:52.940 --> 1:50:56.300]  Humans should be trusted to be in control of themselves and I thought we all learned
[1:50:56.300 --> 1:50:59.940]  that that was the right way to do it, I thought that the proof that the American way of life
[1:50:59.940 --> 1:51:03.820]  was the most free and prosperous and the bastion of all hope and freedom on the planet was
[1:51:03.820 --> 1:51:08.420]  proof enough entering the 21st century that this is how it needs to be, might not be perfect
[1:51:08.420 --> 1:51:14.220]  but it's much better than what we left in the 20th century, but no, here we are again.
[1:51:14.220 --> 1:51:18.540]  And so what happens, well you've got all the government corruption I just covered but they
[1:51:18.540 --> 1:51:22.020]  always protect themselves.
[1:51:22.020 --> 1:51:27.260]  Highest Missouri state court finds Kim Gardner only $750 after she admits to wrongdoing in
[1:51:27.260 --> 1:51:36.180]  Griton's case, records show 62 acts of misconduct, so you had the corrupt FBI and a Soros circuit
[1:51:36.180 --> 1:51:42.580]  attorney set up a governor, Eric Griton, set him up, frame him, much like they tried to
[1:51:42.580 --> 1:51:46.740]  frame those individuals for kidnapping Governor Whitmer, much like they tried to frame people
[1:51:46.740 --> 1:51:51.860]  for kidnapping Northam, much like they framed people on January 6th, feds framing people,
[1:51:51.860 --> 1:51:59.660]  they got caught doing it to Eric Griton's and all you have is a $750 fine.
[1:51:59.660 --> 1:52:05.940]  Those are communists, those are dirtbags, those are corrupt government officials.
[1:52:05.940 --> 1:52:13.460]  And of course, your infrastructure is going to fail, globalist wiping out small business
[1:52:13.460 --> 1:52:18.820]  owners through high energy costs, bingo, that's what it's really all about, that's what the
[1:52:18.820 --> 1:52:23.940]  manmade climate change narrative is really all about, pricing you out of energy, that's
[1:52:23.940 --> 1:52:24.940]  what it's really all about.
[1:52:24.940 --> 1:52:28.820]  The elites are the only ones that should be allowed to have energy, not you.
[1:52:28.820 --> 1:52:32.900]  So you're going to be priced out of energy and it's all in the false narrative name of
[1:52:32.900 --> 1:52:39.860]  manmade climate change that doesn't even exist, at least nowhere near the scale they're claiming.
[1:52:39.860 --> 1:52:45.300]  So they're going to shut you down and they're going to make your infrastructure fail.
[1:52:45.300 --> 1:52:50.860]  India asks residents to avoid charging electric vehicles due to blackout risk days after unveiling
[1:52:50.860 --> 1:52:53.140]  new gas car ban, isn't that funny?
[1:52:53.140 --> 1:52:57.020]  We're banning gas cars, but by the way, don't charge your electric vehicle because we don't
[1:52:57.020 --> 1:53:00.580]  have the energy capacity.
[1:53:00.580 --> 1:53:06.300]  And now they've put out this heat bulletin, excessive heat starting tomorrow will stress
[1:53:06.300 --> 1:53:11.020]  energy grid, consumer conservation likely needed this weekend to avert power outages.
[1:53:11.020 --> 1:53:13.780]  So they're going to shut your power off, it has nothing to do with the heat.
[1:53:13.780 --> 1:53:18.660]  I went and I looked, they're expecting 96 degrees in California tomorrow.
[1:53:18.660 --> 1:53:25.940]  Folks, the entire months of June and July in Austin, Texas were about 100 degrees on
[1:53:25.940 --> 1:53:31.180]  average without any relief from the sun.
[1:53:31.180 --> 1:53:37.940]  I mean, we had about 60 straight days of 100 degrees and clear skies with the sun beating
[1:53:37.940 --> 1:53:41.940]  down on us.
[1:53:41.940 --> 1:53:44.480]  And our energy grid didn't fail.
[1:53:44.480 --> 1:53:45.780]  We didn't have to shut off the energy.
[1:53:45.780 --> 1:53:49.340]  Now warnings were put out, there were requests made.
[1:53:49.340 --> 1:53:52.220]  There may have been some compliance, but it wasn't a big thing.
[1:53:52.220 --> 1:53:53.860]  It wasn't a huge problem.
[1:53:53.860 --> 1:53:57.340]  There wasn't massive energy grid shutdowns.
[1:53:57.340 --> 1:54:02.540]  So why is 96 degrees in California going to force them to shut the grid down?
[1:54:02.540 --> 1:54:03.540]  It's not.
[1:54:03.540 --> 1:54:04.540]  It's a lie.
[1:54:04.540 --> 1:54:06.780]  These are what communists do.
[1:54:06.780 --> 1:54:08.420]  It's false scarcity.
[1:54:08.420 --> 1:54:10.680]  It's control.
[1:54:10.680 --> 1:54:14.900]  This is like when Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, I think it was last year or maybe
[1:54:14.900 --> 1:54:19.180]  it was two years ago where he put out a tweet saying, it's three o'clock, it's time to turn
[1:54:19.180 --> 1:54:26.060]  your AC off, it's time to shut all your electricity off, we're conserving energy.
[1:54:26.060 --> 1:54:32.180]  Now look, I'm okay with the notion that we could be better stewards to this planet.
[1:54:32.180 --> 1:54:37.180]  I'm okay with ideas that suggest, hey, maybe we could be more energy conscious.
[1:54:37.180 --> 1:54:38.180]  I'm okay with that.
[1:54:38.180 --> 1:54:40.380]  I think that's fine.
[1:54:40.380 --> 1:54:41.420]  Here's the problem.
[1:54:41.420 --> 1:54:48.540]  You can't force people to do it and when the people promoting that are the biggest liars
[1:54:48.540 --> 1:54:53.860]  and conmen and thieves in this country's history, well, we're not going to listen to you.
[1:54:53.860 --> 1:54:59.820]  If we had noble leaders that actually practiced what they preached say, hey, you know what?
[1:54:59.820 --> 1:55:04.180]  We might be able to save energy and consume less energy and that might be better for our
[1:55:04.180 --> 1:55:06.740]  civilization and the planet long term.
[1:55:06.740 --> 1:55:08.540]  Here's some of the things we could do.
[1:55:08.540 --> 1:55:13.140]  Maybe you can consider doing that and then okay, well, maybe you do.
[1:55:13.140 --> 1:55:14.140]  Maybe it works.
[1:55:14.140 --> 1:55:15.140]  Maybe it doesn't.
[1:55:15.140 --> 1:55:16.140]  Maybe you save on some energy bills.
[1:55:16.140 --> 1:55:19.580]  But when it's the biggest liars, thieves, and conmen that this country and this planet
[1:55:19.580 --> 1:55:24.940]  has ever seen telling you that you can't use energy while they fly around the planet on
[1:55:24.940 --> 1:55:31.100]  private jets and they circumnavigate the planet on their gigantic yachts and they've got ten
[1:55:31.100 --> 1:55:35.340]  mansions around the planet that all have their thermostats at 69 degrees, then of course
[1:55:35.340 --> 1:55:36.820]  we're not going to listen.
[1:55:36.820 --> 1:55:38.860]  Of course not.
[1:55:38.860 --> 1:55:39.860]  You're liars.
[1:55:39.860 --> 1:55:40.860]  You're conmen.
[1:55:40.860 --> 1:55:42.140]  You don't practice what you preach.
[1:55:42.140 --> 1:55:46.100]  So that's why they have to force you to do it.
[1:55:46.100 --> 1:55:51.020]  A water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi has left residents with no running water, a hospital
[1:55:51.020 --> 1:55:53.860]  without air conditioning and moved schools online.
[1:55:53.860 --> 1:55:57.900]  Jackson likely to go without reliable drinking water indefinitely.
[1:55:57.900 --> 1:55:59.580]  And so what are they saying though?
[1:55:59.580 --> 1:56:02.380]  They're blaming it on white people.
[1:56:02.380 --> 1:56:04.060]  They're saying, oh, it's white.
[1:56:04.060 --> 1:56:05.260]  It's white people.
[1:56:05.260 --> 1:56:06.460]  It's white racism.
[1:56:06.460 --> 1:56:07.980]  The whites did this.
[1:56:07.980 --> 1:56:13.780]  75% of Jackson, Mississippi is black.
[1:56:13.780 --> 1:56:19.860]  So okay, there's your race argument down the drain, but it has nothing to do with race.
[1:56:19.860 --> 1:56:26.300]  In fact, if you really want to know what's about to hit this country, the infrastructure
[1:56:26.300 --> 1:56:30.540]  is about to fail in ways you can't even imagine, folks, like what's happening in our military.
[1:56:30.540 --> 1:56:36.900]  US Army grounds entire fleet of Chinook helicopters because they're malfunctioning and not working
[1:56:36.900 --> 1:56:40.540]  and there've been engine fires.
[1:56:40.540 --> 1:56:46.300]  Ten Navy helicopters suffer major damage, several blown out in sudden storms.
[1:56:46.300 --> 1:56:50.660]  So I mean, it's just, but here's what's going on.
[1:56:50.660 --> 1:56:55.900]  Colleges are now saying that, quote unquote, minorities don't have to pass MCATs or SATs
[1:56:55.900 --> 1:56:57.900]  or ACTs to get into colleges.
[1:56:57.900 --> 1:57:01.900]  You've got all this formative action, so you can have a straight A student get rejected
[1:57:01.900 --> 1:57:06.100]  from a college, but a student that has straight Cs that to minority will get accepted.
[1:57:06.100 --> 1:57:08.980]  And then in the affirmative action in the workplace, they get hired for a job that they're
[1:57:08.980 --> 1:57:10.220]  not qualified for.
[1:57:10.220 --> 1:57:17.820]  So what do you think is going to happen when you have a bunch of unqualified people in positions
[1:57:17.820 --> 1:57:19.220]  that they shouldn't be in?
[1:57:19.220 --> 1:57:23.060]  Your infrastructure is going to collapse, your military is going to collapse, and your
[1:57:23.060 --> 1:57:25.980]  civilization is going to collapse.
[1:57:25.980 --> 1:57:28.100]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[1:57:28.100 --> 1:57:31.020]  Oh, but it's affirmative action.
[1:57:31.020 --> 1:57:39.300]  We're helping minorities know you're crushing civilization with false promotion.
[1:57:39.300 --> 1:57:44.580]  Oh, you're not smart enough for this job, but your skin color is right, so we put you
[1:57:44.580 --> 1:57:45.580]  in charge.
[1:57:45.580 --> 1:57:49.020]  Oops, the whole, the whole plant failed.
[1:57:49.020 --> 1:57:52.940]  Just look at these headlines from Reuters.
[1:57:52.940 --> 1:57:58.860]  World faces unprecedented global hunger crisis, UN chief says, going into 2023.
[1:57:58.860 --> 1:58:04.140]  World Food Program warns of global food catastrophe, looming global catastrophe.
[1:58:04.140 --> 1:58:09.860]  The world could run out of food by 2023, major studies say, and the reports go on and on.
[1:58:09.860 --> 1:58:13.380]  We told you this was a designed program by the globalist two and a half years ago.
[1:58:13.380 --> 1:58:17.460]  We told you energy and food prices would explode, and now they're up more than 40% of the US
[1:58:17.460 --> 1:58:18.460]  alone.
[1:58:18.460 --> 1:58:20.340]  Some areas of the world, they're up over 100%.
[1:58:20.340 --> 1:58:23.700]  The only way you beat inflation and protect yourself and your family is with high quality
[1:58:23.700 --> 1:58:31.420]  swarble food ready to ship right now at preparetoday.com, at a very rare sale of 10% off site-wide.

[1:58:48.140 --> 1:58:51.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, if millions of people get this book, our funding problems will be
[1:58:51.700 --> 1:58:53.540]  over, and it's starting to happen.
[1:58:53.540 --> 1:58:57.100]  That's why I said, yeah, go to infoworkstore.com, get the book and start shipping in a couple
[1:58:57.100 --> 1:58:58.100]  weeks.
[1:58:58.100 --> 1:58:59.100]  The great reset in the war for the world.
[1:58:59.100 --> 1:59:03.300]  But I said, go to Amazon because it's the number one book chart in the world, and if
[1:59:03.300 --> 1:59:07.420]  it goes to number one, not a political, not of history, not of US history, it's already
[1:59:07.420 --> 1:59:11.220]  number one over 40 categories like political science, you name it.
[1:59:11.220 --> 1:59:13.380]  40 plus categories is number one.
[1:59:13.380 --> 1:59:18.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, drum roll, please, of books in the world.
[1:59:18.420 --> 1:59:24.380]  The great reset in the war for the world is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[1:59:24.380 --> 1:59:29.100]  We are now number nine in the world.
[1:59:29.100 --> 1:59:30.340]  This is major.
[1:59:30.340 --> 1:59:31.340]  This is political.
[1:59:31.340 --> 1:59:33.140]  This could fund our war chest.
[1:59:33.140 --> 1:59:36.740]  Just go to Amazon.com, everybody, and buy 10 copies.
[1:59:36.740 --> 1:59:41.180]  Send this blueprint to the Death Star and the New World Order, because you read this,
[1:59:41.180 --> 1:59:42.660]  you know their whole plan, how to stop them.
[1:59:42.660 --> 1:59:44.500]  Get the great reset in the war for the world now.
[1:59:44.500 --> 1:59:45.500]  It's going to go to number one.
[1:59:45.500 --> 1:59:50.500]  What do you make of that?
[1:59:50.500 --> 2:00:10.180]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:00:10.180 --> 2:00:19.020]  So Justin Trudeau is admitting that politicians are more hated than ever, and of course we
[2:00:19.020 --> 2:00:20.020]  all know why.
[2:00:20.020 --> 2:00:26.340]  That's because our politicians are more corrupt and two-faced and have never had such disdain
[2:00:26.340 --> 2:00:33.780]  for the people than they're displaying now, but Trudeau won't admit that.
[2:00:33.780 --> 2:00:39.340]  Oh, what does Trudeau blame all the resentment towards politicians on now?
[2:00:39.340 --> 2:00:40.340]  Climate change?
[2:00:40.340 --> 2:00:41.340]  That's right.
[2:00:41.340 --> 2:00:42.340]  Here he is in clip seven.
[2:00:42.340 --> 2:00:48.220]  I'm just wondering, what do you think is behind the rise in threats that politicians are
[2:00:48.220 --> 2:00:49.220]  facing?
[2:00:49.220 --> 2:00:56.460]  We've missed you a lot.
[2:00:56.460 --> 2:00:57.460]  He's corrupt.
[2:00:57.460 --> 2:01:01.140]  As a country, as a world, over these past years, obviously, the pandemic.
[2:01:01.140 --> 2:01:02.140]  You lied about that.
[2:01:02.140 --> 2:01:04.260]  Increasing anxiety because of climate change.
[2:01:04.260 --> 2:01:05.260]  You lied about that, too.
[2:01:05.260 --> 2:01:06.700]  Transformations of our economy.
[2:01:06.700 --> 2:01:07.700]  You lied about that.
[2:01:07.700 --> 2:01:14.460]  There is a rise in mental health and addiction problems, particularly with the opioid crisis
[2:01:14.460 --> 2:01:17.060]  that has been ravaging communities across the country.
[2:01:17.060 --> 2:01:19.060]  You caused that by colluding with big farms?
[2:01:19.060 --> 2:01:21.940]  It's a lot of pressure on a lot of people.
[2:01:21.940 --> 2:01:22.940]  Because of you.
[2:01:22.940 --> 2:01:31.540]  Unfortunately, there are no easy solutions for all these challenges we're facing.
[2:01:31.540 --> 2:01:32.540]  Yeah, there is.
[2:01:32.540 --> 2:01:33.540]  Easy one.
[2:01:33.540 --> 2:01:34.540]  You get out.
[2:01:34.540 --> 2:01:35.540]  It's going to take hard work.
[2:01:35.540 --> 2:01:36.540]  It's going to take people.
[2:01:36.540 --> 2:01:37.540]  Not really.
[2:01:37.540 --> 2:01:38.540]  The government's stepping up.
[2:01:38.540 --> 2:01:39.540]  Oh, more government.
[2:01:39.540 --> 2:01:40.540]  Oh, I love that.
[2:01:40.540 --> 2:01:41.540]  Pause that one.
[2:01:41.540 --> 2:01:43.540]  Oh, we need more government.
[2:01:43.540 --> 2:01:46.740]  Justin Trudeau, there's never been more disdain for the government.
[2:01:46.740 --> 2:01:47.740]  What do you think the answer is?
[2:01:47.740 --> 2:01:50.020]  We need more government.
[2:01:50.020 --> 2:01:51.940]  And everything he just said is the very reasons.
[2:01:51.940 --> 2:01:53.180]  They lied about COVID.
[2:01:53.180 --> 2:01:55.100]  They lied about climate change.
[2:01:55.100 --> 2:02:00.100]  They gave big pharmaceutical more power than they've ever had.
[2:02:00.100 --> 2:02:01.380]  They did all of that.
[2:02:01.380 --> 2:02:03.300]  They lied to us about all of it.
[2:02:03.300 --> 2:02:04.580]  And we know it now.
[2:02:04.580 --> 2:02:06.820]  And we don't like you for it.
[2:02:06.820 --> 2:02:07.820]  But what is his solution?
[2:02:07.820 --> 2:02:09.700]  Well, you need to give me more power.
[2:02:09.700 --> 2:02:11.900]  No, you just need to get the hell out.
[2:02:11.900 --> 2:02:13.220]  You just need to leave us alone.
[2:02:13.220 --> 2:02:17.060]  You just need to go disappear, crawl into a hole, and everything will be just fine.
[2:02:17.060 --> 2:02:19.500]  I mean, it's no secret, folks.
[2:02:19.500 --> 2:02:22.900]  The quickest solution to saving America is getting rid of the Democrat Party, removing
[2:02:22.900 --> 2:02:24.540]  all Democrats from positions of power.
[2:02:24.540 --> 2:02:26.540]  This country will surge overnight.
[2:02:26.540 --> 2:02:30.700]  Now, you're going to have to deal with the cowardly Republicans, too, but they're not
[2:02:30.700 --> 2:02:32.420]  the ones sabotaging the country.
[2:02:32.420 --> 2:02:34.380]  They're just a bunch of wussbags.
[2:02:34.380 --> 2:02:58.540]  Let's continue here with Trudeau.
[2:02:58.540 --> 2:03:15.780]  All right, that's enough.
[2:03:15.780 --> 2:03:26.900]  Is that Fidel Castro's son, Fidel Castro's other son, Ted Cruz, he's actually getting
[2:03:26.900 --> 2:03:28.820]  it right.
[2:03:28.820 --> 2:03:32.860]  He is actually understanding that the government is the problem and we need less of it.
[2:03:32.860 --> 2:03:39.820]  So here's Ted Cruz in a candid moment discussing corruption and the solution with the FBI in
[2:03:39.820 --> 2:03:57.780]  clip 14.
[2:03:57.780 --> 2:04:18.060]  Now, I think that that's a undercover left winger that goes in there.
[2:04:18.060 --> 2:04:21.860]  This group called the undercurrent, they try to be like Project Veritas for liberals,
[2:04:21.860 --> 2:04:26.420]  but they can't because Republicans aren't con men and liars that cheat, lie, and steal,
[2:04:26.420 --> 2:04:28.660]  and then you can catch them admitting it behind the scenes.
[2:04:28.660 --> 2:04:33.220]  They're just mostly upright, upstanding people, pussies, maybe, but they're actually better
[2:04:33.220 --> 2:04:34.220]  people than Democrats.
[2:04:34.220 --> 2:04:38.140]  Project Veritas suggests because Democrats and liberals are liars and con men, so you
[2:04:38.140 --> 2:04:40.020]  catch them behind the scenes admitting the truth.
[2:04:40.020 --> 2:04:43.380]  But the undercurrent thinks that that hurts Ted Cruz.
[2:04:43.380 --> 2:04:50.140]  Ted Cruz calling for the abolishment of the FBI, yeah, I celebrate that from Ted Cruz.
[2:04:50.140 --> 2:04:53.580]  Thank you, undercurrent, for getting Ted Cruz to admit that.
[2:04:53.580 --> 2:04:59.020]  Thank you very much.
[2:04:59.020 --> 2:05:27.420]  Thank you, undercurrent, for getting Ted Cruz to admit that.
[2:05:27.420 --> 2:05:57.260]  Thank you, undercurrent, for getting Ted Cruz to admit that.
[2:06:18.260 --> 2:06:26.660]  I've got a whole stack of news here, not only do we have radical liberals, sexually grooming
[2:06:26.660 --> 2:06:31.580]  children in the classrooms, we now have multiple stories where they're actually engaging in
[2:06:31.580 --> 2:06:37.420]  sexual acts with the students, and then the liberals on the school board cover it up,
[2:06:37.420 --> 2:06:40.500]  and then later they get hired to work on Democrat party campaigns.
[2:06:40.500 --> 2:06:42.060]  Who knows?
[2:06:42.060 --> 2:06:46.340]  You protect a pedophile, you might be the next Supreme Court justice as long as you're
[2:06:46.340 --> 2:06:48.020]  a good liberal Democrat.
[2:06:48.020 --> 2:06:53.100]  And so Sarah Gonzalez from the blaze has been covering this a lot, specifically what's
[2:06:53.100 --> 2:06:54.420]  going on in Texas.
[2:06:54.420 --> 2:06:57.740]  Now Sarah, I find this hilarious here.
[2:06:57.740 --> 2:07:00.820]  As if this is somehow, there needs to be a debate about this.
[2:07:00.820 --> 2:07:05.660]  Franklin High School teacher's lesson stirs up debate, a debate about what?
[2:07:05.660 --> 2:07:09.980]  Texas high school teacher tells students not to judge pedophiles who have sexually abused
[2:07:09.980 --> 2:07:11.980]  five-year-olds.
[2:07:11.980 --> 2:07:15.380]  Franklin High School teacher's lesson on sex with five-year-old viral video sparks
[2:07:15.380 --> 2:07:16.380]  row.
[2:07:16.380 --> 2:07:18.500]  So apparently we're supposed to debate this?
[2:07:18.500 --> 2:07:24.500]  We're supposed to debate whether teachers sexually grooming and raping children is a
[2:07:24.500 --> 2:07:25.500]  good thing.
[2:07:25.500 --> 2:07:27.500]  Apparently this is a debate, Sarah.
[2:07:27.500 --> 2:07:32.900]  Yeah, it's really sad to see Owen, how far we've come in this matter.
[2:07:32.900 --> 2:07:37.060]  I mean, you know, there were a lot of people whenever we talked about the gay marriage
[2:07:37.060 --> 2:07:40.940]  issue who said this is a slippery slope and before you know it, they're going to be trying
[2:07:40.940 --> 2:07:44.980]  to, you know, make us empathetic towards pedophiles.
[2:07:44.980 --> 2:07:48.180]  And here we are, and we're having this conversation about whether or not we should sexualize
[2:07:48.180 --> 2:07:49.180]  children.
[2:07:49.180 --> 2:07:52.860]  We're having this conversation about whether or not children can consent to not only sexual
[2:07:52.860 --> 2:07:55.700]  acts but also mutilating their own genitals.
[2:07:55.700 --> 2:08:01.500]  And we're having a conversation about changing the terminology of pedophiles to calling them
[2:08:01.500 --> 2:08:05.220]  minor-attracted persons, again, to create that empathy.
[2:08:05.220 --> 2:08:08.820]  You have empathy for this person because, I mean, they can't help it, Owen.
[2:08:08.820 --> 2:08:10.340]  They can't help themselves.
[2:08:10.340 --> 2:08:11.660]  They are attracted to minors.
[2:08:11.660 --> 2:08:13.700]  It is something that they cannot control.
[2:08:13.700 --> 2:08:14.940]  And what happens next?
[2:08:14.940 --> 2:08:16.180]  They also cannot control.
[2:08:16.180 --> 2:08:19.180]  So, you know, it's really sad to see, I think there are a lot of people who should feel
[2:08:19.180 --> 2:08:23.620]  very vindicated for whatever it's worth, which is not much, but feel very vindicated in
[2:08:23.620 --> 2:08:26.740]  knowing that they were correct when they said this is a slippery slope.
[2:08:26.740 --> 2:08:28.140]  This is where it's going to lead.
[2:08:28.140 --> 2:08:29.140]  And here we are.
[2:08:29.140 --> 2:08:31.380]  And it's really sad, especially for people like me who have children.
[2:08:31.380 --> 2:08:35.300]  I mean, we are raising the next generation and the amount of shielding that we're having
[2:08:35.300 --> 2:08:40.380]  to do for our children to make sure that they are not affected by all of these radical,
[2:08:40.380 --> 2:08:46.780]  you know, pedophiles and these radical perverted people is just, it's really, really sad.
[2:08:46.780 --> 2:08:55.580]  I went undercover to a drag show here in Texas over the weekend, and it was, here's the footage
[2:08:55.580 --> 2:08:56.580]  you're showing it now.
[2:08:56.580 --> 2:09:00.340]  It was really, really perverse what we saw.
[2:09:00.340 --> 2:09:06.500]  Children tipping drag queens, often force-fed dollars by their mothers so that they could
[2:09:06.500 --> 2:09:09.380]  tip these drag queens, drag queens on tables.
[2:09:09.380 --> 2:09:15.540]  So we're talking about a grown man in a skirt, a very short skirt standing on a table where
[2:09:15.540 --> 2:09:21.080]  there was a young girl just underneath who was able to look up the skirt.
[2:09:21.080 --> 2:09:25.780]  So it's just, it's really scary what's happening, especially in Texas.
[2:09:25.780 --> 2:09:30.460]  And I think there are a lot of people who have taken for granted that Texas would just
[2:09:30.460 --> 2:09:34.660]  always be conservative and red, and that's just where you could go and didn't pay any
[2:09:34.660 --> 2:09:39.900]  attention to all of these left-leaning, radical Democrats from California and other places
[2:09:39.900 --> 2:09:41.740]  who were moving here.
[2:09:41.740 --> 2:09:42.740]  And here we are.
[2:09:42.740 --> 2:09:44.260]  And I witnessed it with my own eyes.
[2:09:44.260 --> 2:09:45.260]  It was disgusting.
[2:09:45.260 --> 2:09:46.760]  It was perverted.
[2:09:46.760 --> 2:09:51.140]  There are so many aspects, Owen, that I could get into with you about this quote, family-friendly
[2:09:51.140 --> 2:09:53.180]  drag show.
[2:09:53.180 --> 2:09:57.380]  But I think that it's really sad that there are any parents in this society who are willing
[2:09:57.380 --> 2:09:59.660]  to put this on their children.
[2:09:59.660 --> 2:10:04.620]  Well, and just to add some evidence to what you're talking about, there was a couple that
[2:10:04.620 --> 2:10:09.620]  moved to Austin, Texas from California, obviously, because they wanted to escape the hellhole
[2:10:09.620 --> 2:10:11.500]  that Democrats made in California.
[2:10:11.500 --> 2:10:15.700]  And then they gave $5 million, I think that was the number, to Beto O'Rourke's campaign
[2:10:15.700 --> 2:10:20.060]  because they didn't get it yet, because they're not bright people, obviously, they're Democrats.
[2:10:20.060 --> 2:10:24.260]  But I want to get back into the issue where they want to change the terminology and call
[2:10:24.260 --> 2:10:27.700]  them maps, but you just talked about, you know, people are saying, it's time for the
[2:10:27.700 --> 2:10:28.980]  mama bears to step up.
[2:10:28.980 --> 2:10:30.700]  And I'm seeing the mama bears step up.
[2:10:30.700 --> 2:10:36.460]  I think we are seeing a lot of action being taken, it's sad that it's women that have to
[2:10:36.460 --> 2:10:40.740]  take this leadership role because let's say that you, let's say you take your kids to
[2:10:40.740 --> 2:10:46.380]  the park and they're playing around on the park and some dude shows up in a tutu and
[2:10:46.380 --> 2:10:52.340]  a wig with fake breasts and starts dancing and gyrating for children on the pool.
[2:10:52.340 --> 2:10:57.420]  I mean, I'm not asking, I'm not demanding people be violent, but I mean, let's be clear,
[2:10:57.420 --> 2:11:01.180]  I think a father might be inclined to give that guy a knuckle sandwich and put his head
[2:11:01.180 --> 2:11:03.180]  in the dirt.
[2:11:03.180 --> 2:11:06.780]  Yeah, you know, there are two aspects at play here.
[2:11:06.780 --> 2:11:09.900]  You mentioned the mothers who, there are mama bears who are standing up.
[2:11:09.900 --> 2:11:15.380]  There are also, unfortunately, at that pack, I mean packed Owen, this, you can see it right
[2:11:15.380 --> 2:11:16.380]  here in the video.
[2:11:16.380 --> 2:11:17.380]  It was packed.
[2:11:17.380 --> 2:11:19.300]  It was so packed that they were over fire code.
[2:11:19.300 --> 2:11:22.900]  They admitted to me personally that they were violating fire code.
[2:11:22.900 --> 2:11:24.900]  Now we called the cops, but did the cops do anything?
[2:11:24.900 --> 2:11:26.180]  No, of course not.
[2:11:26.180 --> 2:11:28.660]  So this was an event that was packed.
[2:11:28.660 --> 2:11:32.980]  There was overflow and obviously a lot of mama bears consenting to it.
[2:11:32.980 --> 2:11:39.460]  But the amount of fathers that were in attendance at this event was the most appalling thing
[2:11:39.460 --> 2:11:41.340]  to me about the event.
[2:11:41.340 --> 2:11:47.180]  All of the children that I saw that were tipping, that were taking pictures, that were clapping
[2:11:47.180 --> 2:11:52.620]  along all had fathers standing there, going along with it, clapping along with them.
[2:11:52.620 --> 2:11:57.180]  There's one right there, a father taking the picture with his two young daughters and his
[2:11:57.180 --> 2:12:03.140]  wife with these grown men dressed as women trying to sexualize his children.
[2:12:03.140 --> 2:12:07.780]  I don't know if it's all the soy in the food, but I don't know what the hell has happened
[2:12:07.780 --> 2:12:10.260]  with American men and how they're standing by.
[2:12:10.260 --> 2:12:13.220]  I get it that white liberal women are mentally ill.
[2:12:13.220 --> 2:12:14.220]  I get that.
[2:12:14.220 --> 2:12:16.100]  But what about the dads?
[2:12:16.100 --> 2:12:17.860]  Why are the dads not stepping up?
[2:12:17.860 --> 2:12:23.620]  Are they so whipped and brainwashed by their wives that they just can't stand to step up?
[2:12:23.620 --> 2:12:25.100]  I don't know what it is.
[2:12:25.100 --> 2:12:28.460]  Maybe you can shed some light on it, but it has to change.
[2:12:28.460 --> 2:12:29.780]  The dads have to be stepping up.
[2:12:29.780 --> 2:12:36.060]  I said, I don't understand with what I was witnessing how there was not a group of dads
[2:12:36.060 --> 2:12:39.260]  in the community who said, hell no, we're not going to let this happen.
[2:12:39.260 --> 2:12:42.580]  We're going to go in and we're going to disrupt the event and we're going to shut this thing
[2:12:42.580 --> 2:12:43.580]  down.
[2:12:43.580 --> 2:12:47.020]  Obviously not with violence or anything like that, but you go in and you let your voices
[2:12:47.020 --> 2:12:49.300]  be heard and that didn't happen.
[2:12:49.300 --> 2:12:55.260]  So I just, it's appalling to me that it has to be the group of moms that are standing
[2:12:55.260 --> 2:12:57.820]  up that are protesting across the street.
[2:12:57.820 --> 2:12:59.660]  Where in the hell are the fathers?
[2:12:59.660 --> 2:13:03.340]  Well, it's a shame that you're asking me for clarification on that issue because that's
[2:13:03.340 --> 2:13:04.460]  what I was going to ask you next.
[2:13:04.460 --> 2:13:06.060]  It doesn't make any sense to me.
[2:13:06.060 --> 2:13:08.020]  It doesn't make any sense to me.
[2:13:08.020 --> 2:13:12.940]  I mean, maybe the one thing you hinted at and maybe that's it, are they just so whipped
[2:13:12.940 --> 2:13:17.180]  by their wives, are they just so controlled by their wives, are they just so cucked?
[2:13:17.180 --> 2:13:19.060]  I mean, are they filled with the soy?
[2:13:19.060 --> 2:13:20.740]  I mean, I can't figure it any other way.
[2:13:20.740 --> 2:13:21.740]  It doesn't make any sense.
[2:13:21.740 --> 2:13:28.500]  I mean, I guess it might be one thing if like the mom took her daughter to one of these
[2:13:28.500 --> 2:13:32.780]  things, maybe, but it's like, oh, it's a family event and let's, I want my son to look at
[2:13:32.780 --> 2:13:37.620]  a dude dressed like a woman flashing his trouser snake in front of little girls.
[2:13:37.620 --> 2:13:38.620]  Yeah.
[2:13:38.620 --> 2:13:44.180]  I mean, I do think there is something to be said for radical feminism and the fact that
[2:13:44.180 --> 2:13:49.260]  we have emasculated our men and made our women more masculine.
[2:13:49.260 --> 2:13:52.860]  So the women are likely running the show.
[2:13:52.860 --> 2:13:57.340]  The women are the masculine figures and the men are very emasculated all the time by their
[2:13:57.340 --> 2:14:01.380]  wives and therefore just kind of go along to get along with the wives.
[2:14:01.380 --> 2:14:05.580]  But you have to think that there would be a certain point in their brain where they
[2:14:05.580 --> 2:14:10.660]  would click and their defense mechanism would come up and their protection mechanism would
[2:14:10.660 --> 2:14:11.660]  come up.
[2:14:11.660 --> 2:14:15.940]  And they would say, I can't let you do this to my child anymore because used to, especially
[2:14:15.940 --> 2:14:21.540]  at the drag show over in Dallas at the gay bars, we would at least see that it was just
[2:14:21.540 --> 2:14:22.540]  single moms.
[2:14:22.540 --> 2:14:25.660]  It just appeared to be these moms that were doing this to their young boys because they
[2:14:25.660 --> 2:14:30.500]  had a vendetta against their ex-husband and wanted to trans their kids.
[2:14:30.500 --> 2:14:32.260]  Well, now that's not what we're seeing.
[2:14:32.260 --> 2:14:33.780]  We're seeing these dads go along with it.
[2:14:33.780 --> 2:14:39.300]  And I can't help but think that it must just be these emasculated feminized men that were
[2:14:39.300 --> 2:14:45.220]  confusing to make them think that their masculine is toxic and they shouldn't have it on display
[2:14:45.220 --> 2:14:46.780]  anymore.
[2:14:46.780 --> 2:14:47.780]  And here we are.
[2:14:47.780 --> 2:14:49.140]  And the dads are just allowing this.
[2:14:49.140 --> 2:14:53.820]  They're subjecting their children to it and they're going along with these monstrosities
[2:14:53.820 --> 2:14:59.620]  that's going to affect their children for a very, very, very long time, if their children
[2:14:59.620 --> 2:15:00.620]  survive this.
[2:15:00.620 --> 2:15:04.540]  And of course, a lot of times they change them into trans and then they end up harming
[2:15:04.540 --> 2:15:06.040]  themselves.
[2:15:06.040 --> 2:15:09.100]  And maybe too, as I was just looking at some of this footage, it looks like some of these
[2:15:09.100 --> 2:15:13.620]  fathers are really enjoying the show, but one guy was trying to get the up skirt.
[2:15:13.620 --> 2:15:17.540]  He really had a nice smile on his face, kind of like Joe Biden in a child classroom.
[2:15:17.540 --> 2:15:22.260]  So maybe there's an element here that they're just not getting any gratification from their
[2:15:22.260 --> 2:15:23.260]  wives.
[2:15:23.260 --> 2:15:26.500]  And they think this is like the only hope I have of, I guess, maybe getting like some
[2:15:26.500 --> 2:15:27.500]  skin time.
[2:15:27.500 --> 2:15:28.820]  I mean, I don't know.
[2:15:28.820 --> 2:15:34.580]  But there's no doubt, here's one aspect of it, and we'll talk on this after the break.
[2:15:34.580 --> 2:15:39.060]  The one aspect that I think is obvious is that they just want to rub our face in it.
[2:15:39.060 --> 2:15:43.380]  Half of the motivation of this is just to rub it in our face, own conservatives, own
[2:15:43.380 --> 2:15:45.420]  Christians, own Americans.
[2:15:45.420 --> 2:15:49.860]  That's why when there's street preachers out at these gay pride events, these gay men go
[2:15:49.860 --> 2:15:54.140]  and gyrate and strip and make out and rub their genitals on the street preacher just
[2:15:54.140 --> 2:16:03.460]  to rub it in his face, the cavalry for your immune system, the cavalry for your health
[2:16:03.460 --> 2:16:10.500]  and the cavalry to keep info wars on the air with funding has now arrived a 360 win, almost

[2:20:03.020 --> 2:20:15.740]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:15.740 --> 2:20:24.940]  American Zollace is our guest, she's a host at Blaze TV, the news and why it matters.
[2:20:24.940 --> 2:20:30.820]  One of the things that I actually was getting messages in the break, people were saying
[2:20:30.820 --> 2:20:36.660]  Owen, one of the reasons why parents are afraid to speak out against the trans agenda because
[2:20:36.660 --> 2:20:41.220]  they get threatened by liberals that they're going to send CPS to take their kids and they're
[2:20:41.220 --> 2:20:43.340]  going to lose parental rights.
[2:20:43.340 --> 2:20:46.780]  And so there's definitely an aspect of that happening Sarah, I don't know if you have
[2:20:46.780 --> 2:20:50.580]  any more personal experience with that or you know other parents that have said that.
[2:20:50.580 --> 2:20:56.020]  So I want to talk on that, why parents are so afraid to speak out against this agenda
[2:20:56.020 --> 2:20:57.820]  in the classrooms in the hospitals.
[2:20:57.820 --> 2:21:05.220]  But first, do you agree, I think 50% of the motivational factor to these events and that's
[2:21:05.220 --> 2:21:08.180]  why there's all the hoopla, that's why there's all the hype, that's why there's all the
[2:21:08.180 --> 2:21:16.380]  media, sexualizing and grooming kids is a get conservative moments for the left.
[2:21:16.380 --> 2:21:20.780]  They really view this as a let's stick it to conservatives, let's stick it to Christians,
[2:21:20.780 --> 2:21:27.060]  let's stick it to Republicans by grooming children, by sexualizing children, like if
[2:21:27.060 --> 2:21:33.380]  you can't take a look in the mirror and realize that you have fallen way far from the moral
[2:21:33.380 --> 2:21:39.540]  compass, that you have fallen into the depths of evil, that you're going to use children
[2:21:39.540 --> 2:21:41.740]  to stick it to conservatives.
[2:21:41.740 --> 2:21:46.780]  But that's what I see going on, I see it these events, I see it at the gay pride parades.
[2:21:46.780 --> 2:21:54.620]  Half of the motivational factor here is let's be as flagrantly abusive of children, flagrantly
[2:21:54.620 --> 2:21:59.420]  as sexual deviant as possible in public because that'll own the conservatives.
[2:21:59.420 --> 2:22:01.420]  Do you agree with that?
[2:22:01.420 --> 2:22:07.580]  I do, I absolutely do, it has become own the cons to the extent that we will ruin our own
[2:22:07.580 --> 2:22:10.860]  children too by the way, I mean I think that's important to point out, we're not even just
[2:22:10.860 --> 2:22:16.460]  talking about someone else's children, you have liberal families, liberal moms and dads
[2:22:16.460 --> 2:22:22.420]  who are willing to sacrifice their own children at the altar of their religion which as we
[2:22:22.420 --> 2:22:28.640]  all know is their political ideology, especially when you talk about the LGBTQIA apostrophe
[2:22:28.640 --> 2:22:37.260]  plus semicolon crowd, this is their religion, they live and die for this particular ideology
[2:22:37.260 --> 2:22:42.620]  so I guess it should come as no surprise that they're willing to commit child sacrifice
[2:22:42.620 --> 2:22:48.980]  in order to achieve their goals but I also think the other part of it is that we've allowed
[2:22:48.980 --> 2:22:53.740]  them to gain so much traction, we've allowed them to control so much of the conversation,
[2:22:53.740 --> 2:22:58.540]  we've completely given up our power and I do understand what you're talking about and
[2:22:58.540 --> 2:23:03.260]  what the viewers out there, they feel trapped because you're either going to have CPS called
[2:23:03.260 --> 2:23:08.140]  on you or you're going to be found out as a red hat wearer and get fired from your job
[2:23:08.140 --> 2:23:12.660]  or whatever the case may be but I think that in that moment we really are giving up our
[2:23:12.660 --> 2:23:17.460]  power, I think we saw that during COVID, I think we see this during the LGBTQ conversation,
[2:23:17.460 --> 2:23:20.660]  I think we're seeing it over and over again that people are forgetting that there are
[2:23:20.660 --> 2:23:27.580]  a lot more of us out there than we realize because we're also afraid to speak up, I
[2:23:27.580 --> 2:23:32.660]  mean imagine if you will, if we would have just spoken up against all of the mask mandates
[2:23:32.660 --> 2:23:36.900]  and the vaccine mandates and I know I'm kind of getting going to another topic here but
[2:23:36.900 --> 2:23:40.980]  it's all related, imagine if we had spoken up and enough of us had said no I'm not going
[2:23:40.980 --> 2:23:44.380]  to get the damn shot, enough of the nurses at the hospital said no I'm not going to
[2:23:44.380 --> 2:23:48.540]  get the damn shot and they all walked out and there were no nurses to treat any patients,
[2:23:48.540 --> 2:23:49.980]  what do you think the hospitals would have done?
[2:23:49.980 --> 2:23:54.500]  It's the same thing in this instance, there are enough of us, we have the power but we're
[2:23:54.500 --> 2:23:58.940]  just giving it away because we're too scared.
[2:23:58.940 --> 2:24:05.020]  And this goes back to what you said at the beginning here because people didn't speak
[2:24:05.020 --> 2:24:14.660]  out about the gay agenda now here we are and they properly posed themselves saying look
[2:24:14.660 --> 2:24:17.740]  if you don't like this you're a bigot and people don't want to be called a bigot, they
[2:24:17.740 --> 2:24:20.340]  don't want to be called a racist, they don't want to be referred to as that so they just
[2:24:20.340 --> 2:24:25.100]  kind of let their guard down and they just said fine, if gay people want to get married,
[2:24:25.100 --> 2:24:30.460]  no big deal, no skin off my nose, whatever, I'm not going to fight this, I'm not going
[2:24:30.460 --> 2:24:33.500]  to be called a bigot, I'm not going to be called a homophobe.
[2:24:33.500 --> 2:24:39.740]  Not realizing at the time that was just pushing you down that slippery slope, pushing our
[2:24:39.740 --> 2:24:44.060]  culture, pushing our civilization down that slippery slope, we thought alright fine whatever,
[2:24:44.060 --> 2:24:47.060]  gay marriage, leave us alone, have your gay marriage, we're done with it, we're not going
[2:24:47.060 --> 2:24:52.580]  to debate you anymore, now they are having us debate whether they should be not just
[2:24:52.580 --> 2:24:56.620]  sexually grooming kids in the classroom but folks actually having sex acts with kids,
[2:24:56.620 --> 2:25:01.740]  I mean that's the debate they want to have, we're teachers, liberal teachers having sex
[2:25:01.740 --> 2:25:07.340]  with the students but you know here's what I think is sad about this, why couldn't and
[2:25:07.340 --> 2:25:10.700]  we are kind of getting off onto another lane but like you said it's all connected, well
[2:25:10.700 --> 2:25:15.300]  why wouldn't more nurses stand up and refuse to take the vaccine or why wouldn't more workers
[2:25:15.300 --> 2:25:18.500]  in government stand up and refuse to take the vaccine.
[2:25:18.500 --> 2:25:23.420]  Our country has been under such attack and such sabotage for so long that the majority
[2:25:23.420 --> 2:25:28.700]  of Americans are now living paycheck to paycheck and they feel they can't, they feel they can't
[2:25:28.700 --> 2:25:32.340]  take that risk because if they don't have their job next week they're not paying their
[2:25:32.340 --> 2:25:40.100]  bills and so you know we have so many problems right now that are just all cascading down
[2:25:40.100 --> 2:25:45.500]  on us and the most frustrating part is that we're refusing to address the root cause
[2:25:45.500 --> 2:25:50.500]  of any of it and we have to sit here and debate whether or not kids should be sexualized in
[2:25:50.500 --> 2:25:55.620]  classrooms instead of looking up and saying that's not a debate, that's criminal, let's
[2:25:55.620 --> 2:25:59.540]  have an actual debate about why our country is in such a bad state, no, now we're having
[2:25:59.540 --> 2:26:03.700]  to debate whether or not you should be sexually grooming children in hospitals, that's the
[2:26:03.700 --> 2:26:07.740]  left putting us in their debate arena once again.
[2:26:07.740 --> 2:26:12.380]  Yeah, I mean it's because they have been the ones who have controlled the narrative for
[2:26:12.380 --> 2:26:16.540]  so long and so they were able to push and push and push and now we're constantly on
[2:26:16.540 --> 2:26:20.620]  the defense and they've done a really great job by the way of infiltrating the classrooms
[2:26:20.620 --> 2:26:26.620]  of making sure that it's all of them that are infiltrating the education system, academia,
[2:26:26.620 --> 2:26:32.260]  the medical community, they have done a very slow and incremental move where they have
[2:26:32.260 --> 2:26:38.340]  just very slowly and methodically infiltrated themselves into all of these places and to
[2:26:38.340 --> 2:26:45.100]  that extent that I saw so many teachers at this drag show event for kids, at this family
[2:26:45.100 --> 2:26:50.900]  friendly event, I sat next to a public school teacher which it was a male who was married
[2:26:50.900 --> 2:26:54.620]  but he was there by himself because his wife didn't want to come so try to work that one
[2:26:54.620 --> 2:26:58.380]  out in your head but I was sitting next to him and he was talking about all of these
[2:26:58.380 --> 2:27:02.580]  right wing people, he had to deal with all these right wing people.
[2:27:02.580 --> 2:27:03.580]  Did he have monkeypox?
[2:27:03.580 --> 2:27:04.580]  Sounds like he might have had monkeypox.
[2:27:04.580 --> 2:27:09.140]  I don't know, I didn't want to get close enough to find out but he's talking about
[2:27:09.140 --> 2:27:13.940]  all of these right wing nut jobs who, you know, these parents who come in and actually
[2:27:13.940 --> 2:27:18.460]  think that they want to, you know, that they should have a say in their child's curriculum
[2:27:18.460 --> 2:27:23.020]  and how horrible they were and the other lady next to me was agreeing and saying she has
[2:27:23.020 --> 2:27:27.460]  so many friends who are educators who, you know, have really seen, it's the conservatives
[2:27:27.460 --> 2:27:29.860]  who are now infiltrating the school boards.
[2:27:29.860 --> 2:27:34.420]  I would say we're taking it back but that's a whole other story but the amount of teachers,
[2:27:34.420 --> 2:27:39.540]  there was one point where one of the drag queens said he used to be a teacher, he taught
[2:27:39.540 --> 2:27:42.860]  high school, he taught history, he taught all of these things and they asked how many
[2:27:42.860 --> 2:27:48.060]  teachers were in the house and there were a ton, I mean it was raucous applause.
[2:27:48.060 --> 2:27:53.420]  Our friend Taylor Hanson, he was over there at the event with me and he actually got voice
[2:27:53.420 --> 2:27:57.580]  recording of a teacher talking about, you know, she said that she was with Keller ISD
[2:27:57.580 --> 2:28:01.820]  school district and she said that there were a ton of teachers that were there and they
[2:28:01.820 --> 2:28:05.940]  were just trying to keep it on the down low and they had to remove some posts on their
[2:28:05.940 --> 2:28:10.500]  social media but they were all banding together and they were all showing up to this event
[2:28:10.500 --> 2:28:14.500]  in support of it and these are the people who are teaching the next generation.
[2:28:14.500 --> 2:28:17.740]  They have done this on purpose Owen because they know if they can control the minds of
[2:28:17.740 --> 2:28:19.740]  the youth, they can control everything.
[2:28:19.740 --> 2:28:25.660]  Well and you think about the classroom, it's obviously, you know, the trust we put in teachers
[2:28:25.660 --> 2:28:32.660]  is about as big as a trust we put into any individual, any worker and it's a very compromising
[2:28:32.660 --> 2:28:37.580]  situation, you leave your kids with this individual all day and you know what, I know plenty of
[2:28:37.580 --> 2:28:42.500]  people that love kids in a wholesome way, they love kids, they like uplifting kids and they
[2:28:42.500 --> 2:28:47.260]  like seeing kids grow and become better people and those are the people that become teachers
[2:28:47.260 --> 2:28:52.140]  but see now you realize there's another type of person that wants to get into the classroom
[2:28:52.140 --> 2:28:55.580]  and they don't love kids because they love them, they love kids because they're attracted
[2:28:55.580 --> 2:28:57.780]  to them.

[2:31:25.820 --> 2:31:26.820]  life.
[2:31:26.820 --> 2:31:29.380]  I'm going to wake up today, you know what, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to
[2:31:29.380 --> 2:31:31.780]  make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer.
[2:31:31.780 --> 2:31:34.140]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[2:31:34.140 --> 2:31:36.940]  I don't think that happens very often, it's never happened to me, I've never had anyone
[2:31:36.940 --> 2:31:40.260]  knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy, how can I improve your life in
[2:31:40.260 --> 2:31:41.260]  every single way?
[2:31:41.260 --> 2:31:43.740]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that and that was me.
[2:31:43.740 --> 2:31:47.060]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want
[2:31:47.060 --> 2:31:49.820]  to take control of my health and that's why you need to go to infowars.com, take control

[2:33:31.820 --> 2:33:38.420]  So they want us to have a debate now whether or not liberals should be allowed to sexually
[2:33:38.420 --> 2:33:43.540]  groom and even have sex with kids in the classroom, I'm not even kidding you folks, this is the
[2:33:43.540 --> 2:33:49.060]  debate they want to have after a Franklin high school teacher who was having sexual
[2:33:49.060 --> 2:33:54.540]  intercourse with the students, got caught and he was called a pedophile and the other
[2:33:54.540 --> 2:33:59.340]  teacher saying don't you dare call him a pedophile, he's a minor attracted person, pedophiles
[2:33:59.340 --> 2:34:04.220]  are too marginalized, really people that rape children are marginalized, probably not marginalized
[2:34:04.220 --> 2:34:09.700]  enough, they probably shouldn't even exist if you catch my drift, but they're there and
[2:34:09.700 --> 2:34:16.060]  so what do you think is behind this new rewording of pedophile and now they want to say that
[2:34:16.060 --> 2:34:20.380]  it's a minor attracted person, what do you think is behind that Sarah?
[2:34:20.380 --> 2:34:25.580]  I mean obviously they want to invoke some sort of empathy for these people, they want to
[2:34:25.580 --> 2:34:29.800]  change the language as we see them do all the time, this is how they change the narrative,
[2:34:29.800 --> 2:34:34.860]  this is how they meet their agenda is by changing the language and so instead of calling someone
[2:34:34.860 --> 2:34:40.740]  a pedophile because that has a stigma, this poor pedophile, this poor kid diddler might
[2:34:40.740 --> 2:34:45.380]  feel offended that you are calling them out on their perversion and so they need to find
[2:34:45.380 --> 2:34:50.220]  something a little bit gentler to say that makes it sound like they don't actually have
[2:34:50.220 --> 2:34:53.620]  any control over it, they're just born this way, right?
[2:34:53.620 --> 2:34:58.460]  So we're seeing them shift this, we're seeing this change the language simply because these
[2:34:58.460 --> 2:35:04.820]  are disgusting people, these are perverted people and they want to satisfy their fantasies
[2:35:04.820 --> 2:35:09.660]  of doing things with young children, it really is as simple as that and you know I do think
[2:35:09.660 --> 2:35:15.500]  there's also a certain component of this that again we talked about them doing this slowly
[2:35:15.500 --> 2:35:19.660]  and methodically and the right just standing back and saying I don't want to get involved,
[2:35:19.660 --> 2:35:23.900]  for whatever reason some of them you know very real reasons but they said I don't want
[2:35:23.900 --> 2:35:28.140]  to get involved, I'm gonna just do my thing with my family and I'm gonna go to work and
[2:35:28.140 --> 2:35:32.020]  I'm gonna work hard and I'm gonna come home and whatever you know whoever wants to marry
[2:35:32.020 --> 2:35:38.460]  each other they can do that whoever wants to you know let me let me give you this one.
[2:35:38.460 --> 2:35:42.300]  Everyone I've talked to or I should say a lot of people that I've talked to about adult
[2:35:42.300 --> 2:35:47.660]  drag shows will say they always want to preface it and say I only have a problem if it's under
[2:35:47.660 --> 2:35:51.860]  18, if it's for kids, I don't have a problem with adults going to drag shows, well you
[2:35:51.860 --> 2:35:56.220]  know what I do and I think it's a big problem that nobody has a problem with drag shows,
[2:35:56.220 --> 2:36:00.340]  I'm not saying you should go and ban it, I'm not saying you should protest it but the idea
[2:36:00.340 --> 2:36:07.340]  that we should be celebrating I mean I couldn't fathom as a woman making money, bringing money
[2:36:07.340 --> 2:36:12.700]  to an event, turning around and handing my hard earned money over to a bunch of grown
[2:36:12.700 --> 2:36:19.820]  men who are appropriating my sex and my gender, I just it boggles the mind why that would
[2:36:19.820 --> 2:36:25.540]  be something that would be great, it basically is all of the trans movement, the drag queen
[2:36:25.540 --> 2:36:30.660]  movement, all of these things are basically the actual patriarchy, you know the left insisted
[2:36:30.660 --> 2:36:36.420]  that there was this patriarchy for so long, this is the patriarchy, this is women encouraging
[2:36:36.420 --> 2:36:40.740]  these grown men to appropriate their gender, this is women giving away their hard earned
[2:36:40.740 --> 2:36:47.300]  money to men simply for impersonating them, it is so wild to me that this is acceptable
[2:36:47.300 --> 2:36:52.220]  in society and everyone goes along with it and goes and has you know champagne and mimosas
[2:36:52.220 --> 2:36:56.620]  and kicks back and enjoys it and smiles and laughs and I'm going how the hell did we even
[2:36:56.620 --> 2:37:01.980]  get here, I mean maybe I'm a prude Owen but it just it feels a lot like we just had this
[2:37:01.980 --> 2:37:07.900]  thing where we go you know what, I'm okay with it as long as it's not for kids and they knew
[2:37:07.900 --> 2:37:12.900]  the left knew if they could get us used to this, if they could normalize this kind of
[2:37:12.900 --> 2:37:17.500]  behavior that eventually they could trickle it down to the children and now we're seeing
[2:37:17.500 --> 2:37:19.620]  that happen in the schools.
[2:37:19.620 --> 2:37:26.620]  Well there's no doubt the crossroads of Christianity in the west and freedom in the west left kind
[2:37:26.620 --> 2:37:33.060]  of a void where we do respect freedom and we are tolerant so we let our culture kind
[2:37:33.060 --> 2:37:38.940]  of degrade itself and we let the Cardi B's and the Megan, the Stallions and the Kim
[2:37:38.940 --> 2:37:43.740]  Kardashians become role models for our little girls because we believe in freedom and freedom
[2:37:43.740 --> 2:37:48.860]  of choice and that does come with consequences but I think the proper measurement, hey you
[2:37:48.860 --> 2:37:52.540]  know what, we're going to be Christians, we have our values but we also appreciate freedom,
[2:37:52.540 --> 2:37:56.500]  we realize how important that is for the prosperity of our country but you know when you talk
[2:37:56.500 --> 2:38:02.140]  about the issue of men dressing like women, how is it any different than blackface?
[2:38:02.140 --> 2:38:07.420]  I'm yet to see a legitimate explanation for that because I mean God knows if you do black
[2:38:07.420 --> 2:38:11.220]  voice, unless you're a liberal Democrat, Jimmy Kimmel, Justin Trudeau, you can do blackface
[2:38:11.220 --> 2:38:17.460]  all day long, what's the host, Joy Bayarch, you can do blackface but oh but a man pretending
[2:38:17.460 --> 2:38:23.180]  to be a woman though, that's not offensive at all, I don't see, if anything it's more
[2:38:23.180 --> 2:38:26.820]  offensive because it's not like people in blackface are going out actually pretending
[2:38:26.820 --> 2:38:32.780]  to be black to make money, these are men actually pretending to be women to make money.
[2:38:32.780 --> 2:38:40.460]  Yeah, I mean that and that's why I used the term appropriating our gender on purpose because
[2:38:40.460 --> 2:38:44.580]  this is, I'm using the less language, this is the less own language, you are not allowed
[2:38:44.580 --> 2:38:49.580]  to, as you pointed out, you're not allowed to do blackface, you're not allowed to, you're
[2:38:49.580 --> 2:38:54.140]  not allowed to dress as a certain, you know, maybe, I remember a story a while back of
[2:38:54.140 --> 2:38:59.540]  a girl that went to prom and wore a Japanese style outfit but she wasn't Japanese and
[2:38:59.540 --> 2:39:04.820]  she was making headlines for this, I mean you're not allowed to eat certain food that
[2:39:04.820 --> 2:39:10.620]  is outside your culture, everything is cultural appropriation yet somehow we have these people,
[2:39:10.620 --> 2:39:18.140]  these men who are profiting off of impersonating women and they are appropriating our gender
[2:39:18.140 --> 2:39:25.260]  and weirdly enough women are just celebrating it, they're willing to fund it, it is the
[2:39:25.260 --> 2:39:29.620]  wildest thing that I have ever seen and like I said, I'm not saying I'm trying to take
[2:39:29.620 --> 2:39:36.660]  away an adult's freedom to go to a drag show but I'm saying it should be something that
[2:39:36.660 --> 2:39:41.060]  they should do in secret because they know that society will be disgusted with them.
[2:39:41.060 --> 2:39:45.780]  That's how I feel about it and the fact that the women have cheered this on, the women
[2:39:45.780 --> 2:39:51.860]  are cheering on, the sexualization of their own young girls, of their own young boys is
[2:39:51.860 --> 2:39:54.060]  just absolutely reprehensible.
[2:39:54.060 --> 2:40:00.740]  Yeah, I agree, Kim Kardashian has every right to slut it up and become a billionaire, perfectly
[2:40:00.740 --> 2:40:05.340]  fine and I have every right to say that she's a horrible influence on little girls, that's
[2:40:05.340 --> 2:40:10.700]  how this goes but you know, getting back to the change of the verbology here or the words
[2:40:10.700 --> 2:40:15.020]  here where they want to consider it a minor attracted person because too much of a stigma
[2:40:15.020 --> 2:40:19.540]  comes along with pedophile, okay fine, you know what, I'll even humor you and I'll go
[2:40:19.540 --> 2:40:21.940]  into that arena for a debate.
[2:40:21.940 --> 2:40:27.540]  We have all kinds of problems in this country, we have problems with alcohol abuse and alcoholics
[2:40:27.540 --> 2:40:30.980]  and drug abuse and sex addicts and all this stuff and what do we do?
[2:40:30.980 --> 2:40:37.020]  We say you have a problem, you need help, you have a mental disorder or you have a physical
[2:40:37.020 --> 2:40:41.780]  disorder and a reliance on a chemical that's bad for you, you need to address that and
[2:40:41.780 --> 2:40:44.340]  you need help and you need to get that under control.
[2:40:44.340 --> 2:40:50.820]  So if you, if, if and I'm humoring here, if you want to say minor attracted person is
[2:40:50.820 --> 2:40:54.660]  a mental disorder, I don't know what it's like to be a minor attracted person, okay,
[2:40:54.660 --> 2:41:00.020]  I'm not even going to try so I can't relate to that but okay, let's say that's a real
[2:41:00.020 --> 2:41:05.180]  thing and you can't help it, well just like somebody that's an alcoholic or a drug abuser
[2:41:05.180 --> 2:41:10.820]  or a gambling addict, you need help and you need to put that under control so this would
[2:41:10.820 --> 2:41:15.900]  be like you showing up to alcoholics anonymous and we give you a keg of beer, you show up
[2:41:15.900 --> 2:41:21.060]  to a sex addicts meeting and we bring you three hookers, no, if you're a minor attracted
[2:41:21.060 --> 2:41:25.340]  person we're not putting you in the classroom, we're not putting you at drag queen story
[2:41:25.340 --> 2:41:28.740]  time, we're getting you away from children.
[2:41:28.740 --> 2:41:34.580]  Yeah, and I think it goes back to what we were talking about earlier with the medical
[2:41:34.580 --> 2:41:40.460]  community, they have been infiltrated by all of these radicalists, by all of these perverted
[2:41:40.460 --> 2:41:44.940]  people and they are controlling the narrative, they're controlling the narrative when it
[2:41:44.940 --> 2:41:50.940]  comes to what is deemed acceptable and what is deemed a disorder, we've seen them change
[2:41:50.940 --> 2:41:55.940]  the manuals that they're using, that they're teaching to all of these psychology students
[2:41:55.940 --> 2:42:00.220]  to not include gender dysphoria as a disorder anymore, I mean, we are seeing them change
[2:42:00.220 --> 2:42:06.540]  the language in real time so that the medical community will accept this as normalized and
[2:42:06.540 --> 2:42:14.700]  push this often times on teams, on people, I mean, all of their agenda is being purported
[2:42:14.700 --> 2:42:19.300]  through the medical community and so it's difficult to see how we navigate back to this
[2:42:19.300 --> 2:42:25.140]  because they will always have an expert to back up what they are saying, I just do want
[2:42:25.140 --> 2:42:30.060]  to point out though Owen touch on something that you said earlier, it is a fact that dead
[2:42:30.060 --> 2:42:32.940]  pedophiles do not reoffend.
[2:42:32.940 --> 2:42:40.140]  Well that is a fact, I don't think you can deny that and that's folks again, the most
[2:42:40.140 --> 2:42:45.020]  heinous crime you can commit is a sexual act against a child and the fact that we're sitting
[2:42:45.020 --> 2:42:49.740]  here acting like oh you're a poor victim, you're marginalized because you're sexually
[2:42:49.740 --> 2:42:53.900]  abusing children, I mean that just shows you were total twilight zone, one segment left
[2:42:53.900 --> 2:43:01.900]  with Sarah Gonzalez, don't go anywhere, just look at these headlines from Reuters, world

[2:45:07.380 --> 2:45:13.860]  one cause of marital splits is that there's problems in the bedroom and the number one

[2:47:16.820 --> 2:47:22.740]  left with our guest, sarah gonzalez, she's a host over at the blaze, host of the news
[2:47:22.740 --> 2:47:28.900]  and why it matters, you can follow her on twitter right there at sarah gonzalez tx,
[2:47:28.900 --> 2:47:35.660]  sarah here's the big final question i have for you and we can hone in on this question
[2:47:35.660 --> 2:47:42.140]  with the topic that we've been discussing in this hour with the clear sexual grooming
[2:47:42.140 --> 2:47:47.460]  of children going on, the clear promotion of pedophilia that's going on, but the question
[2:47:47.460 --> 2:47:50.780]  i have for you really expands to everything else, so if you want to answer it on the subject
[2:47:50.780 --> 2:47:59.180]  material and then expand afterwards feel free, the question is let's say you see your school
[2:47:59.180 --> 2:48:05.020]  sexually grooming kids doing the gay pride stuff, everything else, you have a choice,
[2:48:05.020 --> 2:48:12.120]  do you leave the school or do you fight, do you leave that community that's becoming blue
[2:48:12.120 --> 2:48:17.860]  and crime written and socialist or do you stay and fight and it just expands as you
[2:48:17.860 --> 2:48:23.300]  get from the local level to the national level, but i mean isn't that the existential question
[2:48:23.300 --> 2:48:28.260]  that we all have right now as americans, do i just go, do i just leave austin texas and
[2:48:28.260 --> 2:48:32.260]  go find a place on a lake or in the woods where there's not going to be a democrat within
[2:48:32.260 --> 2:48:38.860]  100 miles thank god or do i stay here and try to save american culture and conservative
[2:48:38.860 --> 2:48:44.540]  values in these blue cities, but on the school issue start with that, do you fight it or
[2:48:44.540 --> 2:48:50.820]  do you leave it, so i think that you can do both at the same time when it comes to the
[2:48:50.820 --> 2:48:54.780]  schools and and what i mean by that is i have a little bit of personal experience in this
[2:48:54.780 --> 2:49:00.460]  actually my older son i had at a charter school i worked very hard to find this charter school
[2:49:00.460 --> 2:49:04.180]  for him because i did not want to put him in regular public school and i thought that
[2:49:04.180 --> 2:49:08.580]  i had a good thing going i vetted them very heavily and it turned out through covid they
[2:49:08.580 --> 2:49:12.620]  went insane they did the math mandates when kids went back to school and i said there's
[2:49:12.620 --> 2:49:18.660]  no way in hell that my son is going to wear a mask we're not doing this then later i found
[2:49:18.660 --> 2:49:21.900]  out that they had a black lives matter mural up in the hallways for all the children to
[2:49:21.900 --> 2:49:27.260]  see but that's a different story so i realized i can't subject my son to this right now so
[2:49:27.260 --> 2:49:32.260]  what i did was i left we left the school and i homeschooled him for the entire semester
[2:49:32.260 --> 2:49:36.180]  with a newborn by the way i was completely unprepared to do it but i said it doesn't
[2:49:36.180 --> 2:49:41.380]  matter i have to get my son out of this school because what they're going to do is going
[2:49:41.380 --> 2:49:47.420]  to hurt him so i i left the school i pulled my son out i did a stop gap right i put a
[2:49:47.420 --> 2:49:52.900]  band-aid on it but in the meantime i still fought i fought against all of the math mandates
[2:49:52.900 --> 2:49:56.300]  in all of the schools i fought against the school you know what the school boards were
[2:49:56.300 --> 2:50:01.900]  doing in the area i still fought the school but i needed to remove my son from the toxic
[2:50:01.900 --> 2:50:06.460]  situation and that's what i would encourage everyone to do at least when it comes to schools
[2:50:06.460 --> 2:50:11.940]  because you know i know a lot of people say trust me i understand people work uh people
[2:50:11.940 --> 2:50:16.820]  work very hard they have long hours that the thought of homeschooling their children sometimes
[2:50:16.820 --> 2:50:23.740]  is just it seems like it just it can't happen but if i can do it i can i promise you it there
[2:50:23.740 --> 2:50:28.900]  are oftentimes where it is really not that expensive and it doesn't take the time that
[2:50:28.900 --> 2:50:33.100]  public school takes because you're not a glorified babysitter you're actually getting the curriculum
[2:50:33.100 --> 2:50:37.220]  done so i would encourage parents to look at that and at least remove their children
[2:50:37.220 --> 2:50:41.580]  from the toxic environment while they fight so i think that you can do both i would say
[2:50:41.580 --> 2:50:48.980]  when it comes to the larger aspect of of communities i would look at you know what was it when
[2:50:48.980 --> 2:50:53.780]  you moved there if you live in a place because when you decided to move to that place or
[2:50:53.780 --> 2:50:59.100]  the place had always been like that because this place had a certain mindset the community
[2:50:59.100 --> 2:51:03.700]  had a certain a certain vibe i mean like it or not i know the left wants to just have
[2:51:03.700 --> 2:51:07.620]  this melting pot of all these different people and diversity and all these different things
[2:51:07.620 --> 2:51:12.220]  but that's not how community works community has to have cohesive values and cohesive
[2:51:12.220 --> 2:51:16.100]  morals and if you don't have that you don't have a functional community which is why we're
[2:51:16.100 --> 2:51:20.980]  seeing what we're seeing happening so i think that it is important that if this is the community
[2:51:20.980 --> 2:51:24.220]  that that you grew up in and you look around and you say i don't recognize this anymore
[2:51:24.220 --> 2:51:28.780]  i think you say and you fight but you got to remove your kids from the fallout at the
[2:51:28.780 --> 2:51:32.260]  schools that they're being taught right you always have to protect your children first
[2:51:32.260 --> 2:51:36.820]  i think that you can do that i think that you can do both while you fight but you definitely
[2:51:36.820 --> 2:51:43.300]  fight to to either take back your community your your state your country in some matters
[2:51:43.300 --> 2:51:48.180]  as obviously we're seeing but certainly you don't move to a community and then try to
[2:51:48.180 --> 2:51:53.700]  change it as we see the left always do this is your community it is yours to take back
[2:51:53.700 --> 2:51:58.640]  if you so choose to take back your power and i think that if we see people go to the school
[2:51:58.640 --> 2:52:01.980]  board meetings if people have to ask themselves when is the last time i went to a city council
[2:52:01.980 --> 2:52:05.340]  meeting when is the last time i went to a school board meeting when is the last time
[2:52:05.340 --> 2:52:09.540]  that i pushed back because i got to tell you before our friend alex stein there was nobody
[2:52:09.540 --> 2:52:14.340]  showing up at these meetings trying to press back on these people they are not used to
[2:52:14.340 --> 2:52:19.780]  it so there is so much that we can be doing and we just have to make the time to do it
[2:52:19.780 --> 2:52:24.780]  because it is so so important that we maintain and and take back control of our communities
[2:52:24.780 --> 2:52:29.620]  if not for us at least for our children you know that's so funny you mentioned the alex
[2:52:29.620 --> 2:52:35.420]  stein thing and um you're right nobody watches the stuff in fact i used to go to uh we have
[2:52:35.420 --> 2:52:40.780]  the the the citizens communication is what they call it here at the austin city council
[2:52:40.780 --> 2:52:45.260]  i used to go to it like once a month and then by the fourth or fifth time because i you
[2:52:45.260 --> 2:52:49.820]  know i actually would try to be serious and like bring up serious problems so nobody
[2:52:49.820 --> 2:52:53.900]  really cares by the fifth time i was doing it mayor adler here he wouldn't even show
[2:52:53.900 --> 2:52:57.820]  up he'd leave the room he just leave the room when i would get on the podium because he's
[2:52:57.820 --> 2:53:02.140]  such a coward and then the other city council members ended up following the same suit so
[2:53:02.140 --> 2:53:06.820]  i would be at the podium and there'd only be two members of like a 10 member city council
[2:53:06.820 --> 2:53:09.940]  here and only two would be left over those are the conservatives that actually want
[2:53:09.940 --> 2:53:14.180]  to listen so i quit doing it because it was a waste of time but you're right what was
[2:53:14.180 --> 2:53:19.740]  genius about what stein did is he took the element of comedy and culture jamming and
[2:53:19.740 --> 2:53:25.900]  just shoved it in their face and i would argue that if you combined every city council meeting
[2:53:25.900 --> 2:53:30.980]  in the history of this country and then you combine the views that alex stein got at his
[2:53:30.980 --> 2:53:36.140]  city council meeting i think alex stein has made more people watch a city council meeting
[2:53:36.140 --> 2:53:41.380]  and put more energy and focus on city council meetings than any other person individual
[2:53:41.380 --> 2:53:47.980]  issue of all time but doesn't that just show how so much of what our government does especially
[2:53:47.980 --> 2:53:53.300]  at the local level it's just ceremonious they get into these positions they fluff themselves
[2:53:53.300 --> 2:53:57.340]  up they tell their friends how prestigious they are look at me i'm on the city council
[2:53:57.340 --> 2:54:02.140]  look at me i've got a big chair and i've got a name placard aren't i a big deal but when
[2:54:02.140 --> 2:54:06.340]  it comes to actually showing up doing a job and taking care of things they're not there
[2:54:06.340 --> 2:54:10.940]  i think that issue has been highlighted so much now because stein just goes and does
[2:54:10.940 --> 2:54:15.140]  a comedic routine and it's like nothing really changes they didn't care before they still
[2:54:15.140 --> 2:54:21.820]  don't care after yeah no i i totally agree with you and and it really is uh it's astounding
[2:54:21.820 --> 2:54:27.940]  sometimes to watch the disdain on their faces that they have when he is is coming up and
[2:54:27.940 --> 2:54:32.820]  speaking in front of them because look i mean say what you will about about alex's bits
[2:54:32.820 --> 2:54:36.380]  i think they're as you said i i think that they're genius i think that they're great
[2:54:36.380 --> 2:54:41.460]  but just the the level of disdain that these people have when when he comes up and talks
[2:54:41.460 --> 2:54:46.420]  to them and they speak to him as if he doesn't have the right to address them because they're
[2:54:46.420 --> 2:54:50.860]  they're just so used to for so long people just i mean they didn't have anyone at these
[2:54:50.860 --> 2:54:53.740]  at these school board meetings at the city council meetings they didn't think anyone
[2:54:53.740 --> 2:54:58.300]  was paying attention and i agree with you they do they they think that this is their
[2:54:58.300 --> 2:55:01.380]  you know they're in power and they're in control and they have forgotten somewhere along the
[2:55:01.380 --> 2:55:05.460]  way that they are supposed to serve the people the people are not supposed to serve them
[2:55:05.460 --> 2:55:10.740]  but i think that the more pushback that they get i mean imagine if there were you know
[2:55:10.740 --> 2:55:15.220]  maybe maybe comedy isn't your thing but if there were at least a bunch of alex dines
[2:55:15.220 --> 2:55:20.140]  or or oren schwarriors who just pack the room fill the room at every single one of those
[2:55:20.140 --> 2:55:25.580]  meetings can they can they can they walk away from everyone every single time i would argue
[2:55:25.580 --> 2:55:30.060]  that that they would be scared of the fallout of doing so because they would see that the
[2:55:30.060 --> 2:55:34.380]  tide has turned against them and so because we as we know these politicians even down
[2:55:34.380 --> 2:55:39.460]  to the local level all they care about is remaining in office so if you put the pressure
[2:55:39.460 --> 2:55:43.740]  on them enough in numbers and we don't give up our power and we put the pressure on them
[2:55:43.740 --> 2:55:48.860]  in droves they're gonna want to get reelected and they're going to you know think that the
[2:55:48.860 --> 2:55:54.220]  only way that they can do that is to cater to whatever the popular popular political
[2:55:54.220 --> 2:55:58.260]  ideology is sadly that's how i mean i wish that it wasn't that way but that seems to
[2:55:58.260 --> 2:56:02.900]  be what politics has become is just whoever screams the loudest gets what they want which
[2:56:02.900 --> 2:56:08.020]  is why i would say which is why you see this part that what how many trans people do we
[2:56:08.020 --> 2:56:15.420]  have in this country is like a tiny minute population is it even 1% and and they have
[2:56:15.420 --> 2:56:20.700]  been able to grab the message and they have been able to drive the narrative because they
[2:56:20.700 --> 2:56:25.180]  are they are the ones screaming the loudest the squeaky wheel gets the grease and again
[2:56:25.180 --> 2:56:28.820]  i just think that we've given this up for so long i know a lot of people feel like there's
[2:56:28.820 --> 2:56:33.900]  no hope at all but i would say if you feel like there's no hope what's the harm in just
[2:56:33.900 --> 2:56:38.900]  taking this latch last ditch effort banding together showing up at these school board
[2:56:38.900 --> 2:56:43.180]  meetings showing up at the city council meetings showing up at the capitol showing up by the
[2:56:43.180 --> 2:56:47.780]  way to all of these drag shows even if it's just a protest whatever i would encourage
[2:56:47.780 --> 2:56:52.460]  everyone to follow my social media because i am working on we're in the works of creating
[2:56:52.460 --> 2:56:58.540]  a nonprofit that is going to mobilize people parents in these areas in these communities
[2:56:58.540 --> 2:57:03.380]  where these drag shows are happening and make sure that they can make a difference whether
[2:57:03.380 --> 2:57:08.260]  it be protesting whether it be infiltrating the event whether it be you know where we
[2:57:08.260 --> 2:57:13.940]  are going to mobilize parents who are willing and members of the community to actually do
[2:57:13.940 --> 2:57:18.460]  something about it yeah and i would say it's already happening just look at all the overturns
[2:57:18.460 --> 2:57:22.460]  of the school boards that we've had in the last two years when people realize what the
[2:57:22.460 --> 2:57:26.940]  left was doing to the education system and by the way the trans community is not one
[2:57:26.940 --> 2:57:31.340]  percent of one percent but if they get their way it will be then it will be one percent
[2:57:31.340 --> 2:57:34.700]  then it will be ten percent that's what they're really going for sarah gonzalez thank you

[3:00:29.200 --> 3:00:33.280]  Well, I'm not kid Daly she she's on another mission today
[3:00:33.280 --> 3:00:34.480]  I'm sitting in for her
[3:00:34.480 --> 3:00:40.000]  But I am going to use some information that she sent me and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about this because
[3:00:40.280 --> 3:00:44.520]  I'm gonna tell you I'm in the middle of a storm and you can imagine I left off a word
[3:00:44.520 --> 3:00:48.360]  You can imagine what kind of storm over this issue of whether they're not viruses
[3:00:48.360 --> 3:00:55.280]  I never meant to be in the middle of this, but it's a matter of sharing information and having people decide whether they believe it or not
[3:00:55.280 --> 3:01:00.000]  You know what other people confirm or deny that's what science is it isn't about shouting at each other
[3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:02.720]  It's about sharing information and debating it, right?
[3:01:03.280 --> 3:01:11.080]  But I have come to the notion that there really aren't viruses the way we think they were and I mentioned this the other day on Alex's show
[3:01:11.080 --> 3:01:16.120]  But let let me let me just make sure that you understand that doesn't mean there's not a disease
[3:01:16.120 --> 3:01:22.720]  It doesn't mean that we haven't seen people dying, but we got to look at all the possibilities and not just look at viruses
[3:01:22.720 --> 3:01:29.640]  So so what I'm gonna do this hour is I'm gonna lay out what I know about this and I'm gonna start by by talking about
[3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:34.760]  The the pandemic of 1918 a little more depth than I had a chance to the other day
[3:01:34.760 --> 3:01:41.040]  But I think that we have to this is my kids have told me about that the TLDR
[3:01:42.400 --> 3:01:46.080]  You know too long did not read that's for the guppies that have no no
[3:01:47.160 --> 3:01:49.160]  What do I want to say?
[3:01:49.960 --> 3:01:53.640]  Ability to keep their attention span so they can't read the whole article
[3:01:53.640 --> 3:01:59.040]  They just want to get the subset or they're too busy and here's my TLDR that I think that viruses and
[3:01:59.040 --> 3:02:06.080]  Genetics and stuff. It's they may be real somewhere out there. I don't see any evidence of the viruses
[3:02:06.080 --> 3:02:08.840]  But but not saying they don't completely exist
[3:02:08.840 --> 3:02:14.840]  I will say I think it's a false biologic narrative that we've been dealing with and that it steers us away of real
[3:02:15.040 --> 3:02:20.480]  Looking at real threats to humanity, which are the silent weapons of electromagnetic frequency
[3:02:20.480 --> 3:02:27.720]  And that's what we're gonna really talk about in the big section here and remember this in Latin virus means toxin
[3:02:27.720 --> 3:02:33.360]  I think we've been facing as many on this show have pointed out the the
[3:02:33.480 --> 3:02:37.880]  The chemtrails the food poisoning all the things are going on
[3:02:37.960 --> 3:02:44.720]  We've been we've been subjected to electromagnetic frequency and toxins for a long time and the toxins come in a variety of things
[3:02:45.560 --> 3:02:46.800]  You know
[3:02:46.800 --> 3:02:52.280]  Not just vaccines. We we dealt with fluoride in the water for a long time. That's not
[3:02:52.280 --> 3:02:57.920]  Conspiracy that is fact. Well, it's a conspiracy, but it's not a conspiracy theory. That's conspiracy fact
[3:02:57.920 --> 3:03:05.080]  The the fluoride in the water has been there for a reason and even the EPA recognizes it damages your children's IQ
[3:03:05.080 --> 3:03:08.560]  Why is it still there? I don't know. I've tried to get it out in my town
[3:03:08.560 --> 3:03:13.720]  I can't so we've been faced with all these things. The other thing I'm going to say that I think is fairly
[3:03:14.640 --> 3:03:18.480]  Provable is that the great reset is a nice term
[3:03:18.480 --> 3:03:23.440]  What we're really facing here is an extinction level event and we need to we need to
[3:03:24.040 --> 3:03:32.040]  Have all the brains working and figuring out what's going on because the real the real story here is that human beings are kept in the dark and
[3:03:32.440 --> 3:03:40.120]  We there are murderous technology capabilities out there. We the military industrial complex is multi
[3:03:40.160 --> 3:03:47.200]  It's a multinational corporation. It's not just one nation against another and we're little people are just seeing
[3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:50.400]  Tips, you know knowledge. I think really this is the story
[3:03:50.400 --> 3:03:55.640]  I think of knowledge like a dartboard at the center of the dartboard of the people that really know what's going on
[3:03:56.080 --> 3:04:00.320]  Those of us trying to save lives in all this pandemic the so-called pandemic
[3:04:00.320 --> 3:04:03.760]  Those of us trying to figure out what's been going on from the shedding to whatever
[3:04:04.320 --> 3:04:08.240]  We're on the outside ring. Some of us may have worked in one ring
[3:04:08.240 --> 3:04:11.720]  But we're not in the center and so we have to talk to each other
[3:04:11.720 --> 3:04:17.440]  In a professional manner all of us and try and figure this out and I'm just going to give you some more information
[3:04:17.960 --> 3:04:22.160]  That I think kind of clarifies in my mind where this is heading
[3:04:23.040 --> 3:04:29.200]  Don't misunderstand the fact that the occulting of knowledge the hiding of knowledge is a very sophisticated art
[3:04:29.600 --> 3:04:31.600]  Beyond our wildest expectation
[3:04:31.600 --> 3:04:35.840]  So we're going to be taking a break here in a few seconds and when we come back
[3:04:35.840 --> 3:04:42.360]  I'm going to start talking about the pandemic and then what we learned from 1918 that I think is repeating here
[3:04:42.360 --> 3:04:46.480]  And then we'll go to electromagnetic frequencies. Thank you for inviting me on the show

[3:06:05.560 --> 3:06:10.280]  Hey, well, thank you. I'm dr. Lee Merritt you can usually find me at the medical rebel calm
[3:06:10.280 --> 3:06:18.760]  But I'm sitting in for Kate Daly today who's out, but I gotta tell you that might I recently I did a big deep dive on my
[3:06:18.760 --> 3:06:20.760]  On my
[3:06:21.280 --> 3:06:25.800]  Moment website, I have a little like a pseudo substack because I got demonetized from substack
[3:06:25.800 --> 3:06:31.600]  It's all about what happened really in 1918 and it's important because it's happening again in my opinion
[3:06:31.600 --> 3:06:34.640]  It's happening again and the thing that she pointed out to me
[3:06:34.640 --> 3:06:37.120]  This is how this whole thing got started is Kate said to me
[3:06:37.120 --> 3:06:44.520]  you know I I have this news archive I can look in and what it what I discovered is that the numbers in the
[3:06:44.520 --> 3:06:51.120]  1918 pandemic are being inflated just like the numbers of COVID and she said you know if you look at what happened
[3:06:51.360 --> 3:06:55.120]  She couldn't add up they gave county numbers, but they didn't all put them together
[3:06:55.120 --> 3:06:57.600]  She tried to add them up and she said she figures
[3:06:57.600 --> 3:07:02.440]  There's about a hundred thousand at the most people maybe up to a hundred and fifty thousand
[3:07:02.440 --> 3:07:08.240]  But not more than that who died in the United States during the so-called great pandemic of 1919 or 1918
[3:07:08.240 --> 3:07:15.640]  But by 1920 they'd already started reporting 500 million people or 500,000 people dead in the United States
[3:07:15.640 --> 3:07:21.800]  And then it keeps going up and recently the CDC told us 50 million people died worldwide and
[3:07:22.400 --> 3:07:28.040]  You she looked at papers all in between there and they all the numbers keep getting larger and larger
[3:07:28.040 --> 3:07:33.920]  Well, the disease didn't change in those years. So what's going on? It's the same propaganda. I'm going to tell you I
[3:07:33.920 --> 3:07:38.480]  I I thought this idea that talking heads on the news
[3:07:38.480 --> 3:07:45.760]  This was a digital age problem when they all said the same things and we've all seen those those videos where they superimpose people talking together
[3:07:45.760 --> 3:07:51.920]  And then there was a German. I remember a German TV announcer who died a month after he said this
[3:07:51.920 --> 3:07:54.280]  But he quit and said I'm tying tired of taking
[3:07:55.000 --> 3:07:58.840]  my my talking points from the intelligence services and
[3:07:59.600 --> 3:08:02.360]  He didn't survive too long after that. But nonetheless, I
[3:08:02.360 --> 3:08:04.360]  I thought it was all digital age
[3:08:04.360 --> 3:08:10.880]  But I found right away when I start I I decided to take up what Cape's been doing and I just I got my news archive
[3:08:10.880 --> 3:08:18.240]  I subscribed and it turns out all these small-town newspapers all over the United States were in the same boat by
[3:08:18.880 --> 3:08:24.840]  1919 they were reporting on the pan on the great pandemic of 1918 and and here's four newspapers
[3:08:24.840 --> 3:08:28.240]  I just I'm gonna mention the names. It was the first. I mean, but they were let me tell you
[3:08:28.240 --> 3:08:32.800]  There were a lot of these. It wasn't just these four the Bemidji daily pioneer the Leadville
[3:08:33.080 --> 3:08:37.680]  Harold Democrat the Ferdinand news and the Iowa City citizen that one's caught my mind
[3:08:37.680 --> 3:08:42.480]  But what I noticed was all these articles are exactly the same
[3:08:42.760 --> 3:08:46.680]  They're talking about the pandemic as if it's this horrible thing and they're going on about it
[3:08:46.680 --> 3:08:50.840]  It's all these articles are word-for-word. They weren't published on the same date
[3:08:50.840 --> 3:08:57.320]  They're all about October or not November of 1919, but they have word-for-word identical articles
[3:08:57.320 --> 3:08:59.320]  Okay, now interestingly in the age of
[3:09:00.360 --> 3:09:02.960]  Linotype those articles had to be, you know purposely
[3:09:03.480 --> 3:09:08.800]  Printed by hand so the linotype operator made different typos in different papers, but they were all the same
[3:09:09.200 --> 3:09:10.320]  but
[3:09:10.320 --> 3:09:13.600]  They were and another telling thing is these were never front-page stories
[3:09:13.600 --> 3:09:21.360]  These articles were like next to the church news or the lingerie sales or whatever, you know, they were not for front-page
[3:09:21.360 --> 3:09:29.280]  News now here's another point that according to a 1920 I researched all sorts of things like historical
[3:09:29.720 --> 3:09:31.920]  historical data artifacts and or
[3:09:32.520 --> 3:09:38.080]  Archives and military archives and stuff in 1920 the Harvard historical documents show that
[3:09:38.280 --> 3:09:43.520]  5,000 people in Boston died in the pandemic of 1918, but it was the third largest city for death
[3:09:43.880 --> 3:09:47.480]  again those that number doesn't doesn't ring as a
[3:09:48.200 --> 3:09:50.560]  Crisis of unmitigated proportion, right?
[3:09:50.560 --> 3:09:52.560]  Um
[3:09:52.680 --> 3:09:57.000]  Well, here's here's what I think the another another thing that I've learned
[3:09:57.000 --> 3:10:01.680]  So I've started talking to people and my grandparents lived through this lived through the pandemic
[3:10:01.680 --> 3:10:08.520]  They never once mentioned that you see all these people you see all these pictures because pictures burn their way into your soul
[3:10:08.680 --> 3:10:14.000]  But you know the truth of the matter is and I would anybody that has came from an old family like mine
[3:10:14.000 --> 3:10:17.640]  My grandfather whose birthday actually was yesterday was born in 1884
[3:10:17.640 --> 3:10:22.200]  He was in his young age, you know adulthood during the pandemic
[3:10:22.200 --> 3:10:27.720]  He and my great or he and my grandmother all my great aunts and uncles my dad was 13
[3:10:27.720 --> 3:10:31.400]  My dad had three doctorate degrees by the time he was an adult
[3:10:31.400 --> 3:10:35.600]  But he never and one of was he was a but he ultimately became a country doctor
[3:10:35.600 --> 3:10:37.720]  He went from teaching at Harvard to being a country doctor
[3:10:37.720 --> 3:10:39.600]  He just decided to get out of this stuff
[3:10:39.600 --> 3:10:44.360]  But he said, you know, he told these guys told me stories about the family all over the place
[3:10:44.360 --> 3:10:49.080]  Not one mention in my lifetime with them ever of the 1918 pandemic
[3:10:49.280 --> 3:10:54.840]  So we're expected to believe it was this horrible thing that went across America that we you know
[3:10:55.240 --> 3:11:00.320]  Universities closed down and all these bad things happened, but I'm going to tell you there's something not quite right about this
[3:11:00.840 --> 3:11:02.840]  So when we look at it
[3:11:03.400 --> 3:11:08.080]  The flu it was called the the Spanish flu, but it didn't start in Spain. It started in
[3:11:08.520 --> 3:11:12.440]  Fort Riley, Kansas and in Fort Riley, Kansas
[3:11:12.440 --> 3:11:20.880]  Um, interestingly enough the very first thing that happened. I think I've gone back and looked at again at the military archives here and the and the Kansas City
[3:11:21.440 --> 3:11:27.880]  Historical Society stuff on May 25th of 1917 an army medical school was established in Fort Riley
[3:11:28.440 --> 3:11:34.160]  Now I bring this up because shortly after that about a month or three months after that was there were
[3:11:34.920 --> 3:11:37.880]  525 cases of typhoid fever that occurred in Kansas
[3:11:37.880 --> 3:11:46.480]  And the response to that was to give vaccinations that the Kansas State Board of Health gave 9000 free shots. They called them, right?
[3:11:47.040 --> 3:11:48.560]  And
[3:11:48.560 --> 3:11:53.520]  Presumably about the same time the Navy and Army recruits at Fort Riley were also
[3:11:53.880 --> 3:12:01.120]  Vaccinated in fact, we know they were given vaccines because we have documents in a scientific paper, which I'm going to get to in a minute
[3:12:01.120 --> 3:12:07.040]  Well, interestingly three months after this typhoid fever outbreak and these shots were given
[3:12:07.600 --> 3:12:15.840]  We had an outbreak of meningitis now think about today how one of the big side effects of the vaccine seemed to be
[3:12:16.240 --> 3:12:18.240]  Neurologic problems. We're having
[3:12:18.480 --> 3:12:21.520]  Proud there. They're warning us about flaccid paralysis
[3:12:21.760 --> 3:12:23.760]  Guion Barre
[3:12:24.560 --> 3:12:27.200]  You know the drooping face the
[3:12:27.200 --> 3:12:31.040]  Different nerve single nerve problems that we're experiencing
[3:12:32.320 --> 3:12:34.320]  So so what's really going on?
[3:12:35.120 --> 3:12:40.480]  Is this really meningitis? So the question is three months afterwards. They start having this meningitis now
[3:12:40.480 --> 3:12:48.160]  I've looked when in 2015 when we were when the state of Iowa was going to institute and they did mandatory meningitis shots for the children
[3:12:49.280 --> 3:12:53.760]  I tried to point out that I couldn't find a case of fatal meningitis in a school child
[3:12:53.760 --> 3:12:58.240]  Going back decades actually almost 80 years, okay?
[3:13:00.080 --> 3:13:04.880]  But that the biggest in fact the biggest outbreak I could find had been in the 90s
[3:13:04.880 --> 3:13:10.320]  There was an outbreak of meningitis among gay men in San Francisco. It was a big outbreak nine cases
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:15.920]  So when they talk about outbreaks, that's the numbers we normally are talking about but guess what in Fort Riley?
[3:13:16.240 --> 3:13:21.760]  These out this this this meningitis outbreak the US Navy and Army estimated four years ago
[3:13:21.760 --> 3:13:27.120]  Break the US Navy and Army estimated 40 percent 36 to 40 percent of their troops were affected
[3:13:27.760 --> 3:13:34.000]  This is not a natural outbreak. So this is this is how this whole thing apparently started
[3:13:34.240 --> 3:13:36.880]  And then what did they do to the troops and to the other people?
[3:13:37.360 --> 3:13:42.320]  They actually then we they vaccinated with meningitis vaccines and they talk about it
[3:13:42.960 --> 3:13:47.840]  We have all the we all have all the the historical society records of this. So this is not conjecture
[3:13:47.840 --> 3:13:52.160]  Now interestingly the same names show up all over the place
[3:13:52.640 --> 3:13:57.280]  There was a dr. Frederick Gates who was involved in this dr. Gates was trained
[3:13:57.840 --> 3:14:03.360]  He's he graduated from Yale and he won the Adam white award by the way, which Adam white was a skull and bonesman
[3:14:03.360 --> 3:14:09.600]  I don't know if Gates was but Frederick Gates then went on to Johns Hopkins University and got his medical degree
[3:14:09.600 --> 3:14:14.160]  Where do we hear Johns Hopkins again? We hear it in the event 201 and in this outbreak
[3:14:14.160 --> 3:14:18.640]  They've been very central in doing research and things and he goes off and his first job
[3:14:19.200 --> 3:14:23.600]  after he volunteers for service in the in the world war one is to be a
[3:14:24.240 --> 3:14:25.600]  physician
[3:14:25.600 --> 3:14:29.200]  Consultant for the Rockefeller Institute. I'm telling you can't make this up
[3:14:29.840 --> 3:14:31.040]  and he um
[3:14:31.040 --> 3:14:37.520]  He tells us how these vaccines were made and he talks about giving these vaccines and how they they literally did it by
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:42.400]  Um, they were they were made at the Rockefeller Institute, and then they were reconstituted locally
[3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:45.040]  and they gave these initial doses like by
[3:14:45.840 --> 3:14:50.800]  250 or 500 million cocci they'd counted they they figured out the cocci numbers
[3:14:51.120 --> 3:14:57.120]  And and they kept upping it in the troops until they got to a certain size and they said about half of those vaccinated
[3:14:58.080 --> 3:15:05.520]  Whose whose third injection were due after february 4th 1918 were given a final injection of 4 000 million cocci
[3:15:05.680 --> 3:15:09.680]  on account of the occurrence of several fairly fairly severe reactions
[3:15:09.680 --> 3:15:16.320]  From the larger dose among medical officers at fort riley. So they were having problems and they decided to back down a little bit
[3:15:16.880 --> 3:15:17.840]  um
[3:15:17.840 --> 3:15:22.720]  So when we come back i'm going to talk a little bit more about this. I think I have one the one thing to say I can
[3:15:22.800 --> 3:15:24.800]  snoop squeeze in here that
[3:15:25.360 --> 3:15:30.160]  Probably at the same time they were they if like today they're kind of targeting the native americans
[3:15:30.240 --> 3:15:32.240]  and so the native americans were
[3:15:32.480 --> 3:15:33.840]  um also
[3:15:33.840 --> 3:15:41.440]  Vaccinated and one of the first things we saw after this vaccine rolled out and from january and february of 20 of 1918
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:45.680]  There was a scarlet fever epidemic in kansas affecting four counties
[3:15:46.080 --> 3:15:51.760]  And in march five students at a native american school were affected. We'll talk about that when I get back
[3:15:57.120 --> 3:15:58.720]  Several years ago
[3:15:58.720 --> 3:16:04.720]  I approached one of the top companies in the u.s. That supplies the highest quality signature reducing
[3:16:05.040 --> 3:16:11.040]  Faraday cages the pentagon and other u.s. government agencies and now they have produced specifically for us

[3:16:16.320 --> 3:16:23.360]  Whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone or big pouches that protect laptops and iPads or big bags
[3:16:23.600 --> 3:16:27.120]  That promote whatever electronics you want to put in like desktop computers

[3:17:04.640 --> 3:17:08.960]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my coffee. That was a crazy week
[3:17:08.960 --> 3:17:14.400]  I don't remember sleeping but as far as the products go turbo force is my favorite and all the info wars products are down to

[3:17:20.560 --> 3:17:22.560]  Nobody wakes up in the morning
[3:17:22.560 --> 3:17:26.640]  And thinks I'm gonna give that person over there a better life. I'm gonna wake up today
[3:17:26.640 --> 3:17:31.440]  You know what? I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier happier and richer
[3:17:31.440 --> 3:17:36.000]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me
[3:17:36.000 --> 3:17:38.720]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said tape. There's such a good guy
[3:17:38.880 --> 3:17:43.360]  How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only one person who woke up and thought that and that was me
[3:17:43.440 --> 3:17:46.400]  I woke up and thought you know what? Okay. I want to take control of my life

[3:18:06.480 --> 3:18:10.240]  The most important thing to remember is don't panic
[3:18:10.640 --> 3:18:17.920]  Stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe sound course

[3:18:34.640 --> 3:18:37.680]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now

[3:20:17.120 --> 3:20:21.760]  Alrighty, thank you. I don't see myself, but I guess I'm there. Um, here I am
[3:20:21.760 --> 3:20:26.480]  Uh, thanks. This is the alex jones show and I'm guest hosting. I'm dr. Lee merit
[3:20:26.720 --> 3:20:31.120]  and I'm just telling you the story of the 1918 pandemic and and what I'm getting at is that
[3:20:31.760 --> 3:20:38.960]  This this pandemic was not as advertised. It appears that it was vaccine related that it was
[3:20:39.520 --> 3:20:44.400]  Not as deadly. It was not all over the country. It was confined to cities and military institutes
[3:20:44.640 --> 3:20:50.960]  I was just talking about the timeline and right after they finished the vaccination in february and march
[3:20:50.960 --> 3:20:55.200]  We started to see native americans coming down with this and there were five dead
[3:20:55.600 --> 3:21:00.480]  And 457 were affected in march with what they called strepto grip
[3:21:00.960 --> 3:21:05.840]  It just kept going on until finally in october of 1918. We started seeing
[3:21:06.480 --> 3:21:08.480]  uh cases of influenza
[3:21:08.720 --> 3:21:13.360]  And the interesting thing about this was they could not prove transmission
[3:21:13.840 --> 3:21:18.720]  That's what i'm getting at here about the whole issue of viruses. Is this was this ever a virus?
[3:21:18.720 --> 3:21:21.680]  And if it wasn't what was it and what is it now?
[3:21:22.240 --> 3:21:29.120]  So the unlike today they did autopsies and they actually tried to prove transmission and in boston
[3:21:29.280 --> 3:21:33.840]  They tried to prove transmission by putting well people at 118 volunteers
[3:21:33.840 --> 3:21:39.760]  Although they were probably in the bring in the military bring because uh, they they commuted their sentences after this
[3:21:39.840 --> 3:21:42.800]  That was their reward. So volunteers may be an overstatement
[3:21:43.120 --> 3:21:45.360]  But they were they put their these were young healthy people
[3:21:45.360 --> 3:21:50.320]  They put their faces on the faces of the dying without touching them and just breathe in their exhalations
[3:21:50.480 --> 3:21:52.240]  Not one person got sick
[3:21:52.240 --> 3:21:56.160]  They didn't get sick when they were swabbed with the dying person's nose goo
[3:21:56.640 --> 3:22:02.800]  Or their lung or their they swabbed the dying person's throat and lungs or throat and nose and they put it into the well
[3:22:02.880 --> 3:22:04.080]  They didn't get sick
[3:22:04.080 --> 3:22:09.920]  They couldn't do anything to transfer this disease even horses. They could were getting sick and they couldn't transfer it from one horse to another
[3:22:10.160 --> 3:22:12.160]  Which raises this whole question?
[3:22:12.160 --> 3:22:16.960]  Are we dealing with an infectious agent or a toxin or something in the environment?
[3:22:17.600 --> 3:22:22.160]  Well, that brings us to what was in the environment. So what was in the environment?
[3:22:22.240 --> 3:22:27.040]  Well, it turns out that these young people were down there to learn to be telegram operators
[3:22:27.680 --> 3:22:32.480]  It may come as a surprise to everybody, but we didn't really have influenza outbreaks every year
[3:22:32.480 --> 3:22:37.920]  We didn't have a winter death season until we laid down the telegram lines in the 1850s
[3:22:38.160 --> 3:22:40.960]  And after that we started having these seasonal deaths
[3:22:40.960 --> 3:22:49.200]  Now it may sound crazy at first until we get to the point here, but the point is that we have a
[3:22:51.520 --> 3:22:53.520]  We have multiple things going on
[3:22:53.600 --> 3:23:00.400]  and the the electrification of the ionosphere seems to be a disease producing problem
[3:23:00.960 --> 3:23:03.280]  Influenza simply means influence
[3:23:03.280 --> 3:23:12.560]  Notice that in right during the outbreak here of of covid the CDC published a paper and it showed that neither masking
[3:23:13.600 --> 3:23:22.640]  Disinfecting your environment or wearing gloves made a difference in the transmission of influenza. Why is that? Because maybe it's not a transmissible agent
[3:23:23.200 --> 3:23:27.680]  Okay, but what we do know is that when influenza used to break
[3:23:28.480 --> 3:23:32.160]  All over the world. I mean it would come all over the world at one time
[3:23:32.160 --> 3:23:35.200]  Um in the age of wooden ships and iron men
[3:23:35.520 --> 3:23:39.920]  Uh, the the navy would get it and they'd be out at sea and they hadn't seen anybody in weeks
[3:23:40.000 --> 3:23:45.360]  And yet they were all getting sick and the same thing was happening in ships all over and in countries all over the world
[3:23:45.920 --> 3:23:49.760]  Um in the in the 1700s and 1800s without
[3:23:50.720 --> 3:23:55.040]  An obvious core cause, right? They're not talking to each other. They're not getting near each other
[3:23:55.440 --> 3:23:59.280]  It's it's all over the world simultaneous outbreak. Well some very smart
[3:23:59.280 --> 3:24:01.280]  Um, uh astronomers
[3:24:01.920 --> 3:24:04.320]  Figured out that these these outbreaks
[3:24:04.800 --> 3:24:14.400]  Corresponded over the last 300 years with the sun cycle with electrification of the ion of our ionosphere that that happens when there are sunspots and high
[3:24:14.960 --> 3:24:16.960]  Sunflare activity
[3:24:17.920 --> 3:24:19.360]  and so
[3:24:19.360 --> 3:24:24.400]  one of the and interestingly one of the uh one of the by the way one of the person's names that looked at this as a
[3:24:24.400 --> 3:24:31.280]  A british guy named hope simpson, but there was a canadian. They're canadian if you want to look these up. They're canadian astronomers
[3:24:31.680 --> 3:24:35.120]  Um ken tapping as a canadian astronomer that looked this up
[3:24:35.120 --> 3:24:40.880]  There's a bunch of stuff dr. Arthur first and berg's book the invisible rainbow goes through this in some detail
[3:24:41.360 --> 3:24:43.440]  But the point is is that
[3:24:44.160 --> 3:24:47.760]  Is that in the winter something happens to us every year now?
[3:24:48.160 --> 3:24:52.800]  That was happening kind of like it was only during these outbreaks before and what's been happening
[3:24:52.800 --> 3:24:54.800]  and
[3:24:55.040 --> 3:25:00.080]  And this is why people people want to poo poo this idea of electromagnetic frequencies being damaging
[3:25:00.480 --> 3:25:05.760]  If you're if you're one of those people that think this is all nonsense. I really recommend that you watch dr. Debra's
[3:25:07.200 --> 3:25:12.960]  Uh lecture that she gave in australia and malburn australia years ago to a combined medical school
[3:25:13.840 --> 3:25:15.840]  medical school and
[3:25:15.920 --> 3:25:16.720]  engineering
[3:25:16.720 --> 3:25:24.080]  School and it because this isn't this is the problem of both and she shows the relationship that the idea that we don't have any data
[3:25:24.320 --> 3:25:29.600]  About electromagnetic frequency toxicity is wrong as she pointed out and I think she was once the
[3:25:30.240 --> 3:25:32.720]  physician with the epa or something she had a government
[3:25:33.680 --> 3:25:35.680]  position that that
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:42.160]  Makes her the right candidate to say this she said I thought it was nonsense until I started looking at the data that they put out
[3:25:42.160 --> 3:25:46.640]  Or lack of thereof and I realized they were using the same arguments for this
[3:25:47.200 --> 3:25:52.080]  Electromagnetic frequency toxicity that they were using for secondhand smoke and for cigarette smoking
[3:25:52.720 --> 3:26:00.320]  And it really just is is not not right. So what so what she showed for example, even in 2g and 3g phones
[3:26:00.640 --> 3:26:02.080]  they had
[3:26:02.080 --> 3:26:06.160]  documented cases where women were wearing the phones inside their
[3:26:06.160 --> 3:26:12.960]  um, their jog bra or whatever and they had tumors that outlined the antenna of the phone
[3:26:13.840 --> 3:26:14.800]  um
[3:26:14.800 --> 3:26:18.720]  What were happening to people in in the early 1800s?
[3:26:19.040 --> 3:26:27.120]  They were getting sick along railway lines that that had the tele because the telegram lines were were put along the railways, right?
[3:26:27.840 --> 3:26:28.640]  so
[3:26:28.640 --> 3:26:34.800]  It was it was us and we have in the old days at least they used to teach medical students canon's law of the body
[3:26:34.800 --> 3:26:39.520]  It's a law that says that the body responds to rate of change not to absolutes
[3:26:39.680 --> 3:26:43.680]  So it's interesting that in 1918 the doctors reported it wasn't the
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:49.520]  The scrawny kids from the city that were getting sick when they moved down to fort riley and started training on the telegraph
[3:26:50.080 --> 3:26:54.080]  It was the big farm kids that they're the healthiest looking guys down there
[3:26:54.240 --> 3:26:57.360]  But you see they had come from an area that did not have electrification
[3:26:57.680 --> 3:27:03.760]  So it's the sudden change the sudden change is important. You can you can to some degree
[3:27:03.760 --> 3:27:05.760]  You can um
[3:27:05.840 --> 3:27:06.800]  adapt
[3:27:06.800 --> 3:27:13.200]  But now we're in a world where it's it's almost impossible to get away from the electromagnetic frequencies
[3:27:13.520 --> 3:27:18.720]  And are we completely adapting that is really the question now? I have a a video
[3:27:18.800 --> 3:27:21.520]  I can't show yet, but we're hoping to get to it here soon
[3:27:22.240 --> 3:27:26.160]  to show you how your mitochondria work and how it actually
[3:27:26.880 --> 3:27:28.880]  um
[3:27:29.520 --> 3:27:33.200]  How this can happen how the electromagnetic frequencies can damage our bodies
[3:27:33.200 --> 3:27:38.400]  One of the things we noted are people even in research like alexander graham bell edison
[3:27:38.720 --> 3:27:42.720]  People that were around all this electricity all the time started getting diabetes
[3:27:43.360 --> 3:27:44.240]  um
[3:27:44.240 --> 3:27:48.880]  Animals in this age that we're in now where we keep adding electromagnetic frequencies
[3:27:48.880 --> 3:27:58.160]  They're noticing in veterinary research that animals are becoming more obese. They're having more uh signs and symptoms of a of like pre diabetic states
[3:27:59.280 --> 3:28:00.480]  so
[3:28:00.480 --> 3:28:06.080]  We need to start looking at being not so much at viruses because that's not been so proven
[3:28:06.080 --> 3:28:08.960]  We we know that we can have diseases without them even if they exist
[3:28:08.960 --> 3:28:13.760]  We i'm pretty sure that the the pandemic of 1918 did not involve some infectious virus
[3:28:13.920 --> 3:28:19.120]  They couldn't prove transmission. So what is it? Well, we need to be looking at the electromagnetic frequencies
[3:28:19.760 --> 3:28:20.880]  now
[3:28:20.880 --> 3:28:23.360]  it turns out um and I and I
[3:28:24.240 --> 3:28:29.600]  I sent this little little vignette although the fact checkers say not true not true not true about
[3:28:29.600 --> 3:28:31.040]  wuhan
[3:28:31.040 --> 3:28:38.080]  Yes, because woody harrelson even said hey, you know, this is covet's breaking out in places where the 5g just turned out
[3:28:38.480 --> 3:28:45.280]  But but wuhan was a model city for 5g rollout and when did it when was it announced that it was it was underway?
[3:28:45.360 --> 3:28:48.560]  And it was getting completed. It was october of 2019
[3:28:49.360 --> 3:28:55.760]  This thing is in the city. That's that's what this is talking about. So we'll be back and talk about that in just a minute
[3:28:55.760 --> 3:29:01.680]  People say alex jones crazy. He's a conspiracy theory guys a nutcase. He got these rants and all that
[3:29:03.280 --> 3:29:04.880]  What they miss
[3:29:04.880 --> 3:29:08.640]  Is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics?
[3:29:09.200 --> 3:29:11.520]  Of signal not noise if you look at the signal
[3:29:12.240 --> 3:29:14.240]  and you compare that
[3:29:14.320 --> 3:29:21.920]  To pbs and npr and bbc and we'll do what alex jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there
[3:29:21.920 --> 3:29:27.120]  And if you're setting a human being and just watching it you say well god alex jones is ahead of this not only that
[3:29:27.120 --> 3:29:30.800]  He kind of explained it. You are one of the great thinkers of this
[3:29:31.360 --> 3:29:34.800]  That is very rare. You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation
[3:29:35.360 --> 3:29:40.080]  And see that in this new book. I got to tell you when tony lions first approached me. I read this thing
[3:29:40.080 --> 3:29:42.880]  I go, this is it. This is no beetry
[3:29:43.360 --> 3:29:47.040]  You're not going to be flipping pages here. You're going to be having a pin out and you're going to be underlying stuff

[3:32:11.680 --> 3:32:13.360]  Psychotropic effects
[3:32:13.360 --> 3:32:17.120]  It certainly does for me when I take a couple of these capsules an hour before bed

[3:32:50.960 --> 3:32:54.640]  Thank you all for your support. You're really going to miss out if you don't get it
[3:32:58.240 --> 3:33:04.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones
[3:33:16.560 --> 3:33:19.520]  Alrighty, welcome back to the alex jones show. I'm dr. Lee merit
[3:33:19.520 --> 3:33:25.920]  We're talking I talked about the 1918 pandemic and that it wasn't a virus. It it was a combination of things
[3:33:26.400 --> 3:33:29.440]  um, three things actually it was electromagnetic
[3:33:31.200 --> 3:33:34.480]  frequencies the telegram lines it was
[3:33:35.680 --> 3:33:40.960]  Vaccines that were crude and first time use in a in a war setting for our troops
[3:33:41.280 --> 3:33:44.320]  And the third thing actually I didn't mention was a bad drug now
[3:33:44.320 --> 3:33:48.480]  We have remdesivir back then we had aspirin and bear aspirin had lost its
[3:33:48.480 --> 3:33:50.480]  uh patent
[3:33:50.480 --> 3:33:55.760]  And it had convinced all these doctors to give handfuls of aspirin to to these sick kids
[3:33:56.000 --> 3:34:01.760]  And unfortunately it caused bleeding and that one of the things that was noted in the pathology was that they had bled in
[3:34:01.840 --> 3:34:03.840]  Many of them had bled into their lungs
[3:34:04.400 --> 3:34:06.400]  even today though
[3:34:06.480 --> 3:34:13.440]  Researchers going back in and looking at the at the autopsy findings by the way in the 1918 pandemic
[3:34:13.440 --> 3:34:19.360]  There was a chinese researcher shang I think his name was and he looked at all these paraffin blocks and at the end of the
[3:34:19.360 --> 3:34:23.840]  Time he said we still don't know. There's not using even modern genetic
[3:34:24.640 --> 3:34:30.240]  Analysis the dna stuff that they're doing. He said we can't show that this was due to a viral outbreak
[3:34:30.240 --> 3:34:33.760]  We can't show that we don't know what it was really cost is so again
[3:34:33.760 --> 3:34:40.400]  We need to be looking at other things and I think the first thing we need to be looking at is electromagnetic frequencies a couple facts
[3:34:40.400 --> 3:34:46.720]  Number one is that ruhan were rolled out 5g right before the outbreak it really and it put it into the hospitals
[3:34:46.880 --> 3:34:51.200]  In fact that hospital where dr. Lee died. I believe was one of the first hospitals. It was completely
[3:34:51.760 --> 3:34:55.680]  Uh where the wi-fi was completely installed and let's look at where else this thing broke out
[3:34:55.920 --> 3:35:00.880]  It broke out in lombardi italy. It broke out in new york. It broke out on cruise ships, which were early
[3:35:02.480 --> 3:35:04.480]  Areas what they installed all this 5g
[3:35:05.280 --> 3:35:06.400]  now
[3:35:06.400 --> 3:35:12.240]  Again, it's not proof. It's just you have to ask yourself and I can tell you if this had been an airborne
[3:35:12.720 --> 3:35:14.720]  disease that they thought
[3:35:14.720 --> 3:35:16.880]  Given the way it was trans you know
[3:35:17.280 --> 3:35:20.080]  The number of people involved that were suddenly becoming sick
[3:35:20.080 --> 3:35:24.560]  I won't say transmission because they couldn't really even prove transmission completely
[3:35:24.880 --> 3:35:28.080]  What they could they they tried to look at within houses lots of times
[3:35:28.080 --> 3:35:31.920]  There would only be one person affected and the other person never got sick
[3:35:31.920 --> 3:35:36.960]  But what they did show in china looking at 10 million traces. They couldn't find or anybody
[3:35:38.160 --> 3:35:42.880]  Asymptomatic person in a household with a with a sick person transmitted it to anybody
[3:35:43.440 --> 3:35:48.240]  So there's something wrong with the whole picture if it had really been transmissible with this kind of death rate
[3:35:48.560 --> 3:35:52.080]  Initially breaking out in china. It would have been all over china. It would have been in paris
[3:35:52.080 --> 3:35:58.960]  It would have been in philadelphia, but it wasn't so it was confined to these areas where 5g rollout was known to have occurred
[3:35:58.960 --> 3:36:04.240]  Again, not proof, but but a question now. It's also interesting that there are only two
[3:36:04.880 --> 3:36:09.120]  Um industries that i'm aware of that are completely indemnified against any medical
[3:36:10.080 --> 3:36:15.360]  Problem and that is the vaccine industry if the vaccines are on the childhood panel
[3:36:15.520 --> 3:36:17.520]  They're they're indemnified
[3:36:17.520 --> 3:36:24.240]  And the second one is the telecommunications industry you can sue the telecommunications industry for their
[3:36:24.240 --> 3:36:30.560]  You know the the the appearance okay, if you think that it's an ugly eyesore by your house
[3:36:30.560 --> 3:36:34.560]  You can you can take them to court, but you can't take them if you think it's killing your children
[3:36:34.960 --> 3:36:40.640]  You know if you're thinking it I also notice that they put these 5g towers up all by schools
[3:36:41.040 --> 3:36:44.960]  Right where I am they seem to all be by schools except in the rural areas
[3:36:45.040 --> 3:36:47.680]  So I don't know what to make of that. Well, I think I do
[3:36:48.240 --> 3:36:51.840]  Um, but it's something that we need to take seriously if this is a problem
[3:36:51.840 --> 3:36:56.320]  You have we are we on the local level are going to have to to make sure that this stops
[3:36:56.880 --> 3:37:03.680]  Um, I'm I know that arthur firstenberg has sent out a compendium of information
[3:37:04.320 --> 3:37:09.680]  And I'm going to try and make that available on my site for people that want to take this on in their counties
[3:37:09.680 --> 3:37:13.280]  That's what we need is county action about getting rid of the
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:19.440]  Uh the wavelength now there are other there are other ways to deal with this and we're going to talk on the um
[3:37:19.440 --> 3:37:25.280]  I guess I'm going to be with oh and shroy are next talking about what we can do to save ourselves physically
[3:37:26.640 --> 3:37:29.200]  And there are lots of things to say about that
[3:37:29.280 --> 3:37:31.440]  We'll try to get to that a little bit here
[3:37:31.440 --> 3:37:34.800]  But mostly I think we're going to talk about that the next hour of treatments
[3:37:34.800 --> 3:37:38.560]  But one of the things is electromagnetic frequency mitigation
[3:37:39.280 --> 3:37:41.280]  You need to block
[3:37:41.280 --> 3:37:49.120]  Rate x-rays, but you don't need to completely block electromagnetic frequency and I'm going to if we have I have a video that I wanted to show you about how
[3:37:49.760 --> 3:37:55.120]  The um electromagnetic frequency actually damages the body just keep in mind
[3:37:55.600 --> 3:37:59.440]  We are we are really holograms. We are really wavelength
[3:37:59.840 --> 3:38:05.200]  Everything in existence, you know, it's the e equals mc squared. It really is mass and energy are
[3:38:05.200 --> 3:38:10.640]  Are the same we're we're wavelength and a projection and
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:13.520]  So
[3:38:13.520 --> 3:38:15.440]  We have to have
[3:38:15.440 --> 3:38:19.920]  Some interaction with the with all these wavelengths. I mean that has to it has to matter
[3:38:20.720 --> 3:38:24.320]  I will tell you two two interesting pieces of information from
[3:38:24.960 --> 3:38:26.160]  um
[3:38:26.160 --> 3:38:27.280]  uh
[3:38:27.280 --> 3:38:28.960]  luke montagnier
[3:38:28.960 --> 3:38:29.760]  and
[3:38:29.760 --> 3:38:33.280]  A russian named kuznachev now luke montagnier showed
[3:38:33.280 --> 3:38:38.080]  Um, and he was the famous french researcher that did the the studies on hiv
[3:38:38.320 --> 3:38:44.000]  Which he's subsequently recanted but still got the Nobel prize which much must have given them some tight jaws
[3:38:44.640 --> 3:38:48.240]  But luke montagnier showed that you could actually save the
[3:38:48.960 --> 3:38:50.960]  imprint of water now
[3:38:51.680 --> 3:38:52.240]  um
[3:38:52.240 --> 3:38:57.600]  Or of dna and water that you can put dna and water it leaves its electromagnetic signature
[3:38:57.600 --> 3:39:05.360]  Even when it's not there you can you can gather that electromagnetic frequency and then you can restore dna in another
[3:39:05.600 --> 3:39:08.720]  Bile of water with the no acid. So it's very interesting stuff that he did
[3:39:09.280 --> 3:39:14.080]  um, everybody working on that by the way got demonetized. They lost their funding and ended up uh, uh,
[3:39:15.120 --> 3:39:16.400]  Jacques
[3:39:16.400 --> 3:39:18.400]  Benaviste was a french researcher
[3:39:18.720 --> 3:39:24.960]  Just at about the same time slightly prior to luke montagnier getting into this and he ended up in a trailer in the back lot
[3:39:24.960 --> 3:39:26.960]  So there's something they don't want us to know about this
[3:39:27.920 --> 3:39:30.880]  But in the in the 30s kuznachev a russian
[3:39:32.080 --> 3:39:33.840]  Show that you can
[3:39:33.840 --> 3:39:38.960]  You can project there's something that comes off of cells that can project disease to other cells
[3:39:39.680 --> 3:39:45.920]  And whatever the disease or damage is the dying cell gives off what they call death photons that go to the other cells
[3:39:45.920 --> 3:39:52.720]  Now, let's just consider the possibility of being able to project disease using that technology using this
[3:39:52.720 --> 3:39:59.760]  Capture of wavelength if we are wavelength then it interacts with us your dna is like a big antenna
[3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:02.480]  And it's a it's a helical structure
[3:40:02.880 --> 3:40:06.240]  Your hair is a helical structure meaning it looks like a spiral
[3:40:07.040 --> 3:40:12.800]  5g was developed by darpa and the and probably other military aspects deep arts
[3:40:13.280 --> 3:40:16.400]  Um, but it was developed by darpa as a denial of access program
[3:40:16.960 --> 3:40:21.120]  If you look that they they used it i believe in in the golf war, um
[3:40:21.120 --> 3:40:26.800]  And they called them they think they called them poppers, but basically you turned on the 5g emitter
[3:40:27.600 --> 3:40:33.600]  And depending on how you turn up the gain and how you turn the frequency it interacts with helical structures
[3:40:34.320 --> 3:40:40.720]  So it interacts with your the way it could clear an area of anybody standing there is it could it
[3:40:40.800 --> 3:40:44.640]  They could set it to interact with your hair follicle. That was the denial of access weapon
[3:40:44.880 --> 3:40:49.600]  And when they turned it on we've had some troops that accidentally got caught in the beam and they reported it
[3:40:49.600 --> 3:40:53.280]  You can't stay there. It makes you feel like your whole body is on fire
[3:40:53.920 --> 3:40:56.480]  because the hair follicle is
[3:40:57.200 --> 3:40:59.200]  Is is is lit up?
[3:40:59.600 --> 3:41:01.600]  no, um
[3:41:02.640 --> 3:41:05.440]  I'm trying to think about what that thing is i'm looking at there
[3:41:09.280 --> 3:41:11.280]  Anyway, uh the
[3:41:12.800 --> 3:41:16.160]  The other thing though it can do think about it it can damage your dna
[3:41:16.160 --> 3:41:20.480]  We know that x-rays. We know that certain wavelengths. We know for sure damage dna
[3:41:21.600 --> 3:41:28.000]  Why are we not talking about what this wavelength is and just so everybody understands when they talk about 5g
[3:41:28.160 --> 3:41:33.440]  It's not a it means fifth generation. It's not a particular wavelength. What they've done is opened up the entire
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:39.760]  Wavelength spectrum available to the telecommunications in industry now above 1 gigahertz
[3:41:40.320 --> 3:41:42.320]  So these are microwaves
[3:41:42.320 --> 3:41:44.320]  um, you know
[3:41:44.320 --> 3:41:49.920]  Why do they tell people with microwave ovens if you have a pacemaker don't get too close to it?
[3:41:50.400 --> 3:41:52.400]  Because they are not completely shielded
[3:41:52.960 --> 3:41:57.040]  So they don't travel microwaves don't travel as far as we
[3:41:58.400 --> 3:42:00.720]  As other waves, but they have
[3:42:01.520 --> 3:42:04.800]  toxicity to our to our tissues in multiple ways
[3:42:05.600 --> 3:42:07.760]  and um
[3:42:07.760 --> 3:42:10.880]  Do we have we don't have the video I I tried to put it out
[3:42:10.880 --> 3:42:16.880]  But I was going to show you how how this works at the mitochondrial level and hopefully we'll just have
[3:42:17.520 --> 3:42:23.760]  Okay, when we come back we'll talk about that because every cell in your body has has mitochondria
[3:42:24.240 --> 3:42:29.040]  um the mitochondria and I think there are about 320 000 mitochondria per cell
[3:42:29.680 --> 3:42:31.520]  and you have
[3:42:31.520 --> 3:42:34.800]  trillions of cells in your body you have um
[3:42:35.520 --> 3:42:37.200]  thousands I think
[3:42:37.200 --> 3:42:43.360]  I can't remember how many nanomotors this is the way a power plant works and it's the way your mitochondria work
[3:42:43.360 --> 3:42:45.360]  And we're going to talk about that when I come back
[3:42:45.760 --> 3:42:47.200]  um
[3:42:47.200 --> 3:42:52.320]  It's the same method. It's all run on electricity your way of your producing energy in the body
[3:42:52.320 --> 3:42:56.320]  So hang on for that. We'll be back in just a couple minutes and we'll go over that
[3:42:56.720 --> 3:42:59.120]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil
[3:42:59.760 --> 3:43:03.760]  Does fantastic things for your cardiovascular system for your brain
[3:43:03.760 --> 3:43:09.440]  for every part of your body, but what I don't see being promoted is the fact that it has
[3:43:10.400 --> 3:43:12.000]  natural
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:13.920]  psychotropic effects
[3:43:13.920 --> 3:43:15.280]  It certainly does for me
[3:43:15.280 --> 3:43:20.880]  When I take a couple of these capsules an hour before bed my sleep my dreams are amazing
[3:43:21.280 --> 3:43:26.720]  Now there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain
[3:43:27.120 --> 3:43:32.800]  But I want you to experience it yourself. We know it's good for your heart. We know it's good for your brain

[3:43:55.360 --> 3:44:02.400]  Seven months ago in december of 2021. We launched the first in the three-coin founding member series
[3:44:02.480 --> 3:44:09.280]  George washington slaying the dragon then we launched the tree of liberty coin at finland the second amendment come and take it
[3:44:09.360 --> 3:44:12.560]  Molon lobby coin. There are only 75
[3:44:13.040 --> 3:44:16.320]  coins left in the three-point series
[3:44:17.040 --> 3:44:19.040]  exclusively right now at
[3:44:19.600 --> 3:44:22.560]  1776 point.com and for the final
[3:44:22.560 --> 3:44:27.760]  75 people become founding members for this big project. We're launching in the near future
[3:44:28.000 --> 3:44:30.640]  You'll also get a personal signed piece of art
[3:44:30.800 --> 3:44:34.480]  I made of the sheepdog chasing the wolf and a personal message
[3:44:34.800 --> 3:44:40.800]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776 point.com
[3:44:41.120 --> 3:44:48.400]  This is history happening now infowarstore support is changing the world and this is the final 75
[3:44:48.400 --> 3:44:54.960]  three-point set exclusively available at 1776 point.com
[3:44:56.720 --> 3:45:00.000]  Just look at these headlines from Reuters
[3:45:00.640 --> 3:45:05.760]  World faces unprecedented global hunger crisis. UN chief says going into 2023
[3:45:06.560 --> 3:45:08.560]  world food program warns of global
[3:45:09.200 --> 3:45:10.480]  food catastrophe
[3:45:10.480 --> 3:45:17.280]  Looming global catastrophe the world could run out of food by 2023 major studies say and the reports go on and on
[3:45:17.280 --> 3:45:21.040]  We told you this was a designed program by the globalist two and a half years ago
[3:45:21.280 --> 3:45:25.760]  We told you energy and food prices would explode and now they're up more than 40% of the us alone
[3:45:26.080 --> 3:45:28.080]  Some areas of the world are up over 100%
[3:45:28.240 --> 3:45:31.760]  The only way you beat inflation and protect yourself your family is with high-quality
[3:45:32.000 --> 3:45:39.200]  food ready to ship right now at preparetoday.com and a very rare sale of 10% off site-wide
[3:45:39.280 --> 3:45:45.360]  Not just on terrible food, but survival and preparedness items is happening right now 10% off at preparetoday.com
[3:45:45.360 --> 3:45:51.840]  And on top of it any order above $99 gets free shipping. That is a huge part of the cost of horrible food
[3:45:52.000 --> 3:45:55.840]  So go to preparedtoday.com and protect yourself and your family while you still can
[3:45:56.320 --> 3:45:58.320]  We are now living in the void
[3:45:58.880 --> 3:46:05.600]  Sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what we've known and what's to come and right now
[3:46:06.000 --> 3:46:09.760]  The most important thing to remember is don't panic
[3:46:09.760 --> 3:46:17.360]  Stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe sound course
[3:46:17.680 --> 3:46:24.240]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building our own society
[3:46:24.560 --> 3:46:29.840]  All we got to do is survive the crash and right now we still have time to prepare
[3:46:30.240 --> 3:46:37.280]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero. It's time to convert it into hard assets now
[3:46:37.280 --> 3:46:42.640]  Including food, water and survival gear to keep us strong and at the ready
[3:46:43.200 --> 3:46:46.800]  Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials

[3:46:55.040 --> 3:47:04.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's alex jones
[3:47:15.520 --> 3:47:18.480]  All right, we're back. This is the alex jones show. I'm dr.
[3:47:18.480 --> 3:47:24.160]  Lee Merritt and I was talking about how electromagnetic frequencies damage the body and there are a couple effects, but
[3:47:24.160 --> 3:47:28.480]  Let's start this video and I'm going to show you the one that I think I think there's a couple of them
[3:47:28.480 --> 3:47:30.480]  We need to talk about this is a big one
[3:47:31.040 --> 3:47:33.040]  It's how you make energy
[3:47:33.200 --> 3:47:38.880]  Okay, now we normally make energy in the grand Cooley dam. It's made because water comes down under pressure
[3:47:39.280 --> 3:47:44.720]  There's there's more water on top of the dam than on the bottom water comes down and it fills these little rotors
[3:47:45.360 --> 3:47:51.840]  These little cups on these rotors and then these spin around and that is attached to a generator that then produces
[3:47:51.840 --> 3:47:58.080]  Electricity and believe it or not in your body. We have actually the same the same principle
[3:47:58.640 --> 3:48:02.800]  We'll give it a minute. Maybe I gave myself too too long to explain that but you've seen it now. This is
[3:48:03.520 --> 3:48:07.120]  This is from harvard university. It's actually the very best
[3:48:09.120 --> 3:48:15.680]  Picture of the mitochondria I've ever seen so here's your cell and in every cell in the human body of which there's trillions
[3:48:15.680 --> 3:48:21.440]  Um, there are these little mitochondria and the mitochondria are your little power plants within the cell
[3:48:21.440 --> 3:48:23.840]  This is what they purportedly look like although
[3:48:23.840 --> 3:48:28.960]  I don't think we completely know and they have all these interior walls that are lined with what they call
[3:48:29.680 --> 3:48:35.440]  Nanomotors and they really work just like that that generator. I just showed you from grand Cooley dam
[3:48:36.400 --> 3:48:42.560]  Your every mitochondria has an inner and outer membrane. This is a lipid bilayer construct
[3:48:42.560 --> 3:48:48.240]  There it is and on one side of the the lipids you have a lot of protons which are hydrogen
[3:48:48.560 --> 3:48:54.240]  Ions and on the other side. It's a lower amount. So you have a gradient now. Look at that that literally is a
[3:48:54.960 --> 3:49:00.640]  Schematic of the proteins that make up these nanomotors and they turn around and they produce
[3:49:01.360 --> 3:49:04.560]  ATP which is the money that's the that's your that's your
[3:49:05.520 --> 3:49:08.560]  Like gasoline that's your fuel in the body to ATP
[3:49:08.560 --> 3:49:12.960]  So you've got all these protons going through this gradient and it's supported by these other
[3:49:13.840 --> 3:49:16.960]  Um, proteins that are the support structure
[3:49:17.280 --> 3:49:22.320]  This is like your power plants on the right and all these complexes are your your mining
[3:49:23.040 --> 3:49:30.480]  Your coal mine and the train that takes the coal to the power plant. That's essentially what this is. We call it the electron transport chain
[3:49:30.480 --> 3:49:38.400]  Now, why is this important? Because everything runs on electricity. It's an electron transport chain
[3:49:38.800 --> 3:49:43.520]  It needs certain things to happen. Now here you see these blue are the electrons
[3:49:44.080 --> 3:49:48.160]  um, they're little electrons dropping down this transport chain
[3:49:48.800 --> 3:49:50.800]  and it's creating
[3:49:51.520 --> 3:49:58.800]  These are redox centers reduction oxidation centers and they're taking a little bit of sugar and they're they're creating an electron
[3:49:58.800 --> 3:50:00.400]  um
[3:50:00.400 --> 3:50:01.520]  gradient
[3:50:01.520 --> 3:50:08.400]  Okay, and what this does there's a low affinity for the electrons at the top and a high affinity for the bottom in other words
[3:50:08.720 --> 3:50:12.720]  There's there's a gradient and if you suddenly walk into an electromagnetic
[3:50:13.600 --> 3:50:14.880]  environment
[3:50:14.880 --> 3:50:16.800]  This is going to change
[3:50:16.800 --> 3:50:22.720]  The gradient on the outside that this has to work against. I mean, I think that's what's one of the problems that's going on
[3:50:22.960 --> 3:50:28.000]  this is a very delicate system and we know that in countries that have
[3:50:28.000 --> 3:50:34.960]  Have suddenly electrified people are start getting diabetes. It's not because of the sugar dropping down the sugar's still there
[3:50:35.120 --> 3:50:38.080]  But now they can't process it because the gradient is screwed up
[3:50:38.720 --> 3:50:44.800]  And this shows now this gradient produces energy that feeds the cell feeds these protein complexes
[3:50:45.200 --> 3:50:48.240]  But some of the electrons are what will become
[3:50:49.520 --> 3:50:51.040]  The power
[3:50:51.040 --> 3:50:56.000]  That's what what we're going to add for the power in the body and so they're like the coal that gets moved forward
[3:50:56.000 --> 3:51:00.480]  On these little these things that look like purple teeth think of these as the coal cars
[3:51:00.960 --> 3:51:07.440]  That are moving the substrate to the power plant. Okay. It's coenzyme q10. Now those of you who take statin drugs
[3:51:07.520 --> 3:51:10.080]  I'm not telling you not to take a drug. I don't give medical advice
[3:51:10.640 --> 3:51:17.040]  But what we know that what statin drugs do is they deplete the coenzyme q10 in the basilar membrane of the mitochondria
[3:51:17.360 --> 3:51:20.000]  That's the little purple teeth here. So if you don't have enough
[3:51:20.480 --> 3:51:24.880]  Coal cars you can't get enough coal to the power plant if you don't have enough coenzyme q10
[3:51:24.880 --> 3:51:31.840]  You can't get enough electrons in your electron transport chain to go to that little nano motor and make your ATP
[3:51:32.400 --> 3:51:34.400]  That's really what's going on here
[3:51:35.360 --> 3:51:39.520]  We'll move it'll it'll tell us and it it'll show us here in a minute how it adds
[3:51:39.920 --> 3:51:44.480]  It adds water it adds oxygen and you're at the at your at the end point
[3:51:46.960 --> 3:51:48.960]  So this is the electron transport chain
[3:51:51.280 --> 3:51:53.520]  This is the bot this is the end complex
[3:51:53.520 --> 3:51:55.520]  Now we're having water
[3:51:57.040 --> 3:51:59.040]  It water contributes it's
[3:52:00.720 --> 3:52:04.160]  There we go the water the oxygen and the water molecule combine
[3:52:06.160 --> 3:52:08.640]  And without oxygen all this thing falls apart
[3:52:09.840 --> 3:52:13.040]  And this allows the electrons to be pumped to the gradient
[3:52:13.040 --> 3:52:24.000]  So part of what does does this is that the we have to keep the gradient going to keep those rotors turning just like Grand Coulee Dam
[3:52:28.560 --> 3:52:30.560]  And then in yourself
[3:52:31.360 --> 3:52:33.680]  There's the electron transport chain and you have you have
[3:52:34.320 --> 3:52:37.200]  gazillions of these things and they're always rotating
[3:52:38.000 --> 3:52:39.520]  now
[3:52:39.520 --> 3:52:46.000]  The final common pathway for disease is right there. It's in the mitochondria. The reason I went to the trouble of showing you that is
[3:52:46.000 --> 3:52:50.400]  It's not just emf that can make you sick. It's anything that toxifies that system
[3:52:51.200 --> 3:52:53.360]  So you deplete the coenzyme q10
[3:52:54.160 --> 3:52:55.840]  you um
[3:52:55.840 --> 3:53:02.160]  You can damage your mitochondria by having too much byproducts of the reactions in other words you get
[3:53:02.160 --> 3:53:10.160]  A reactive oxygen species you get basically think of your think of these things. I think of their little mitochondria like sawmills
[3:53:10.400 --> 3:53:14.000]  Okay, you're going to produce boards. You're going to produce boards from lumber
[3:53:14.240 --> 3:53:19.760]  But the problem is if you don't have somebody inside if you if you're inefficient and you make a lot of sawdust
[3:53:20.160 --> 3:53:23.040]  More than you should because you've got dull blades or something
[3:53:23.440 --> 3:53:27.920]  Then you're then you start creating more sawdust at the expense and you're not making as many boards
[3:53:27.920 --> 3:53:33.600]  That's aging in your mitochondria. You start being less efficient because you start gumming up the works
[3:53:33.680 --> 3:53:37.520]  Your mitochondria are not working as well and there are multiple reasons for that
[3:53:38.080 --> 3:53:38.640]  um
[3:53:38.640 --> 3:53:41.520]  In when when I when we talk about solutions
[3:53:41.760 --> 3:53:46.720]  We have to understand that if it's not just about viruses. It's a if they even exist
[3:53:46.960 --> 3:53:48.960]  It's about toxins to the mitochondria
[3:53:49.760 --> 3:53:57.120]  Ancient medicine looked at two things. They looked at there were two treatments purification and detoxification
[3:53:57.120 --> 3:54:01.280]  Okay, get right with god purification and detoxification
[3:54:01.280 --> 3:54:07.840]  They didn't care they they saw they saw the world as filled with toxins and I think they're ultimately going to be proven right
[3:54:08.720 --> 3:54:12.720]  It's interesting that when you when you look at older medical books
[3:54:13.280 --> 3:54:17.440]  They deal with a couple things they deal with parasites and they deal with toxins
[3:54:18.000 --> 3:54:20.640]  This is where we should attempt put some attention
[3:54:21.200 --> 3:54:26.560]  Uh, one of the toxins is electromagnetic frequencies and we've talked about that a little bit other toxins
[3:54:26.560 --> 3:54:29.680]  Are the poisons in our water our air and our food?
[3:54:30.080 --> 3:54:35.920]  This is a big thing coming to us and a huge toxin is what's in these vaccines
[3:54:36.800 --> 3:54:45.040]  provably now, I think multiple laboratory people have shown that there is graphene oxide in these vaccines
[3:54:45.520 --> 3:54:50.400]  Now, what does graphene oxide do graphene is a huge electron?
[3:54:50.400 --> 3:54:58.000]  Uh transport molecule. Okay, it can it sucks up electrons. It steals electrons from things
[3:54:58.000 --> 3:55:00.000]  It can it can do all sorts of things
[3:55:00.160 --> 3:55:02.960]  But it it one of the things it does is steal electrons
[3:55:03.520 --> 3:55:08.320]  Cationic lipids in the in the vaccines they steal electrons and what do we see?
[3:55:08.400 --> 3:55:12.400]  We see the result of that in clotting and in mitochondrial damage
[3:55:13.520 --> 3:55:18.880]  We need to go back to basics and let's just think about how we can detoxify our mitochondria
[3:55:18.880 --> 3:55:23.280]  And there are lots of different options. We'll be talking about those I think in the next segment
[3:55:23.280 --> 3:55:25.280]  But there are lots of different things we can do
[3:55:25.680 --> 3:55:30.720]  First of all, I tell people stop poisoning yourself stop eating food. That is toxic
[3:55:31.040 --> 3:55:36.880]  Stop don't eat junk don't eat wheat based products that have lots of chemicals in them including glyphosate
[3:55:37.200 --> 3:55:42.240]  Um, including uh chemicals that open up your bowel that damage your immune system
[3:55:42.240 --> 3:55:49.920]  Don't eat artificial oils. It turns out artificial oils are damaging the the seed oils the man-made oils, you know
[3:55:50.960 --> 3:55:56.720]  What what uh one of my favorite people jack Lillian. He's dead now, but he died at 96
[3:55:56.800 --> 3:56:00.960]  I believe doing fingertip push-ups at 92, but what jack Lillian always said is true
[3:56:01.600 --> 3:56:07.680]  If man made it don't eat it, you know, we've been given things that we that look like food
[3:56:07.760 --> 3:56:10.240]  We think are food, but they're not food
[3:56:10.240 --> 3:56:14.240]  You know, if your great-grandmother couldn't recognize that it's food, it's not food
[3:56:14.240 --> 3:56:20.800]  Would your great-grandmother recognize a box at least my great-grandmother in in the 1860s and 70s? No
[3:56:21.200 --> 3:56:23.840]  uh, did if you saw a box of of uh
[3:56:24.640 --> 3:56:29.040]  Of macaroni and cheese instant macaroni and cheese. I don't think she would have recognized that as food
[3:56:29.760 --> 3:56:34.720]  Um, we have so many things like that if it has a big ingredient list think of those ingredients as toxins
[3:56:35.680 --> 3:56:38.800]  Let's eat real food for real people. That's the western a price thing
[3:56:38.800 --> 3:56:44.960]  And let's detoxify our body isn't it interesting too that the other thing that that we've known in classic medicine
[3:56:45.040 --> 3:56:48.720]  worse parasites and the five drugs that they don't want us to have are
[3:56:50.960 --> 3:56:56.000]  All the all the anti-parasitic drugs hydroxychloroquine chloroquine ivermectin
[3:56:56.480 --> 3:57:04.480]  Nidazoxanide and chlorine dioxide, which is not a drug but is used extensively in uh industry and among missionaries to
[3:57:04.480 --> 3:57:08.880]  To do all sorts of good things for the body. So detoxification
[3:57:09.440 --> 3:57:11.280]  Taking out parasites
[3:57:11.280 --> 3:57:13.280]  Let's refocus our energies
[3:57:13.280 --> 3:57:17.520]  Let's think about these emf towers because quite frankly doctors can't solve this one
[3:57:18.000 --> 3:57:22.160]  You at the local level have to solve this one and we're going to get the information out there
[3:57:22.640 --> 3:57:28.480]  And then you need to make make use of it just like you are just I love it just like you are with the electoral process
[3:57:28.800 --> 3:57:30.000]  county level
[3:57:30.000 --> 3:57:36.000]  Take back our environment like we're taking back our electoral process. So I really appreciate being asked to come on
[3:57:36.560 --> 3:57:40.640]  Uh might not be asked back, but anyway, I've had a great time and I hope this has been helpful
[3:57:41.120 --> 3:57:43.600]  Thank you so much. Hope to see you again. Be well

[3:58:53.280 --> 3:58:59.680]  Fortune and money magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year 30 different tax returns 30 different answers
[3:59:00.080 --> 3:59:04.400]  50 different tax returns 50 different answers and almost all of them just
[3:59:04.960 --> 3:59:09.600]  Screw you over especially the big firms and and the big tax groups because they're part of the system
[3:59:09.600 --> 3:59:16.880]  And they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this so it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out
[3:59:16.880 --> 3:59:18.560]  They're hurting everybody
[3:59:18.560 --> 3:59:24.080]  To be able to do things tax wise. It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your money
[3:59:24.080 --> 3:59:28.400]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years
