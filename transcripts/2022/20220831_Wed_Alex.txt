[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:06.452]  Put in your theory of the case, where does Joe Biden's they're-all-fascist or semi-fascist fit in?
[00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:10.013]  And what do you anticipate he's going to tell the nation on Thursday night?
[00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:15.196]  Well, absolutely, what you just said is what he's going to say.
[00:00:15.556 --> 00:00:20.975]   he's going to say the republicans want to take your vote republicans will take your right to kill children
[00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:26.136]   republicans are evil they're bad and basically demonize the republican party
[00:00:26.136 --> 00:00:30.676]   pop down because the populist realignment happen through the republican party does the
[00:00:30.676 --> 00:00:31.915]   democratic party
[00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:35.335]   and so he's gonna try to basically expand this idea
[00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:37.975]   of beginning to outlaw the political
[00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:41.156]   opposition and democrats have been talking about outlawing the republican
[00:00:41.156 --> 00:00:43.656]   party uh... we see them
[00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:46.676]   going around the country with goser
[00:00:46.676 --> 00:00:51.594]   uh... and with green and with countless other races right here in texas
[00:00:51.594 --> 00:00:55.915]   uh... with members of congress the democrats are trying in court cases
[00:00:55.915 --> 00:01:01.396]   to bar multiple current members of congress and people running from
[00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:04.016]   congress to be able to not run because
[00:01:04.016 --> 00:01:20.057]   they questioned the the twenty twenty election And then turning around, he's going to have an address and say that the Republicans are fascist, they don't want dead people and illegal aliens voting, and they don't want mail-in ballots the same way we know they stole the 2020 election.
[00:01:20.097 --> 00:01:39.891]   So it's going to be a declaration of war, an expansion of the ongoing declaration of war, not just against America's energy, Not just our borders, not just our sovereignty, not just our currency, not just the value of our dollar, but a further declaration of war against anyone questioning any of their fraudulent narratives that are collapsing.
[00:01:44.632 --> 00:01:49.613]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:49.453 --> 00:01:51.453]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:51.453 --> 00:02:11.453]  [Music]
[00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:12.701]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:13.421]  Today.
[00:02:15.562 --> 00:02:17.343]  All you have to do is check out what I'm saying.
[00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:23.666]  And that's why they run the fake headline against myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere, every day.
[00:02:24.506 --> 00:02:26.147]  Jones admits he's an actor.
[00:02:27.027 --> 00:02:29.388]  Or Tucker Carlson says nobody would take me seriously.
[00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:31.429]  Where do we say that?
[00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.470]  We never said that.
[00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.811]  They just say we said that.
[00:02:36.092 --> 00:02:36.872]  But where's the clip?
[00:02:37.132 --> 00:02:38.253]  Where's the article?
[00:02:38.273 --> 00:02:38.993]  Where do we say that?
[00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:40.093]  It doesn't exist.
[00:02:40.653 --> 00:02:44.714]  Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist.
[00:02:45.054 --> 00:02:47.975]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show.
[00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:52.216]  The radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act.
[00:02:52.657 --> 00:02:54.597]  He's actually a performance artist.
[00:02:54.777 --> 00:02:56.057]  He's a performance artist.
[00:02:56.418 --> 00:02:57.578]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[00:02:58.238 --> 00:03:01.962]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid.
[00:03:02.502 --> 00:03:06.646]  And it's all based on the custody battle with my ex-wife five years ago.
[00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:14.494]  And she was trying to put into evidence me dressed up more than a decade before, like the Joker, being sarcastic, saying, take your Prozac, kids.
[00:03:14.534 --> 00:03:15.795]  Take your illegal drugs, too.
[00:03:15.815 --> 00:03:16.876]  You'll die.
[00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:17.496]  It's fun.
[00:03:17.857 --> 00:03:19.558]  So people wouldn't take drugs.
[00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:24.041]  And they wanted to enter that in evidence and say, look, he's insane, telling kids to use drugs.
[00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:30.886]  And my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks that's really Jack Nicholson.
[00:03:30.926 --> 00:03:33.187]  So yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander.
[00:03:33.627 --> 00:03:34.788]  Hail Cobra!
[00:03:35.068 --> 00:03:35.969]  Or Optimus Prime.
[00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.970]  Autobots, let's roll!
[00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.852]  Or the Joker, because I can do imitations of them all really good.
[00:03:41.352 --> 00:03:42.013]  Or Darth Vader.
[00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:44.434]  Don't act so surprised, globalist.
[00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:48.417]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[00:03:49.881 --> 00:03:51.282]  Do I really think I'm Barth Vader?
[00:03:51.462 --> 00:03:51.682]  No.
[00:03:51.702 --> 00:03:53.703]  Do I think I'm Optimus Prime?
[00:03:53.743 --> 00:03:54.764]  Bubble Commander?
[00:03:54.804 --> 00:03:55.224]  The Joker?
[00:03:55.284 --> 00:03:55.444]  No.
[00:03:55.764 --> 00:04:02.928]  And clearly, no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire that what I'm saying is what I really think.
[00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:05.069]  No one believes the Babylon Bee.
[00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:08.071]  It's not trying to lie to you, it's being sarcastic.
[00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:10.152]  Buy the Vaccinate Me Elmo doll today.
[00:04:10.532 --> 00:04:12.173]  It's required by the CDC.
[00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:13.574]  But they play those games.
[00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:16.835]  And that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to.
[00:04:17.295 --> 00:04:25.476]  Even though I tell people, okay, this is a joke, this isn't serious, they clip it out and they say, no, this is what he really believes.
[00:04:26.117 --> 00:04:27.917]  Every day when I leave work, I do this.
[00:04:28.457 --> 00:04:29.717]  That man's a threat to this country.
[00:04:29.957 --> 00:04:32.018]  And they go, look, he admitted in court he's an actor.
[00:04:32.258 --> 00:04:34.759]  Well, yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly.
[00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.339]  I was an actor in Waking Life.
[00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.520]  I was an actor when I was Cobra Commander.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:05:04.782]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones the talk show host up here reading news articles to you Isn't a real thing and isn't something I'm actually saying and you know that you're insulted right now I'm even explaining that to you and so am I but that's who these people are You don't know the power of the dark side Am I really Darth Vader?
[00:05:06.095 --> 00:05:07.659]  I think Alex Jones seems really talented.
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.762]  He's smart.
[00:05:09.082 --> 00:05:09.965]  He's funny as hell.
[00:05:10.105 --> 00:05:11.448]  He's truly funny.
[00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:12.749]  I'm kind of retarded.
[00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:20.749]  [Screaming]
[00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:27.749]   Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes, do you now not listen to what I say about other things
[00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:32.749]   when I show you a powerful news article by Dr. Joseph Mercola on Infowars.com?
[00:05:33.631 --> 00:05:35.172]  It has all the cited information.
[00:05:35.493 --> 00:05:38.155]  The latest tragedy, sudden adult death syndrome.
[00:05:38.675 --> 00:05:40.176]  No, that's a real thing.
[00:05:40.937 --> 00:05:43.379]  That's something happening in the real world.
[00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.621]  And that's what we're breaking down here today.
[00:05:46.896 --> 00:05:50.337]  I am Alex Jones, and I am the guy on this show every day.
[00:05:50.697 --> 00:05:57.415]   I am an American and that's what I promote is freedom and justice and liberty and they can't stand it.
[00:05:57.415 --> 00:06:10.055]  Pesky earth creatures.
[00:06:10.055 --> 00:06:21.976]  (Music)
[00:06:21.976 --> 00:06:28.685]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:31.068]  You better believe you got one!
[00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:40.009]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:57.009]  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:56.808 --> 00:06:58.149]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:01.792]  I am Harrison Smith, sitting in for Alex, but not really, actually.
[00:07:01.812 --> 00:07:05.215]  I'll just be here for the first hour, really just setting up what you're about to see.
[00:07:05.275 --> 00:07:14.302]  This is an interview that Alex Jones had with Steve Bannon yesterday on Steve Bannon's show, The War Room Pandemic, and it's an extensive interview, about an hour long.
[00:07:14.322 --> 00:07:25.711]   We're gonna fill up the first hour with it, where they talk about all sorts of topics, but primarily transhumanism, which, of course, you can find all about In The Great Reset and The War for the World, the new book by Alex Jones.
[00:07:26.092 --> 00:07:31.616]  So without any further ado, here it is, the interview from yesterday with Steve Bannon and Alex Jones.
[00:07:31.636 --> 00:07:32.097]  Let's watch.
[00:07:33.178 --> 00:07:36.681]  The next 71 days we're going to see some very violent fireworks.
[00:07:37.421 --> 00:07:48.431]  I would predict racially motivated mass shootings, bombings, poisonings, attacks on power supplies being blamed on the right wing.
[00:07:50.014 --> 00:07:57.236]  They intend to bring in a full dictatorship in the next 71 days, and we are all strapped to this thing.
[00:07:57.996 --> 00:08:05.858]  This is such a dangerous time, and I would advise the globalists, who are mid-level, that think they're about to have a leftist revolution.
[00:08:06.298 --> 00:08:08.599]  The globalists don't actually plan at the higher levels to have that.
[00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:13.020]  They plan on having a civil war that brings down America, and you'll be the fall guy.
[00:08:14.429 --> 00:08:15.310]  Okay, welcome back.
[00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:16.771]  We've got Alex Jones.
[00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:21.013]  The release of the book is today, The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:08:21.774 --> 00:08:22.634]  It's a blockbuster.
[00:08:22.774 --> 00:08:23.735]  Everybody's got to get it.
[00:08:24.195 --> 00:08:32.661]  But I want to get in first, Alex, these comments yesterday, let's talk about them for a second because it's got everybody, obviously, their heads blowing up.
[00:08:33.161 --> 00:08:35.843]  We've got now 70 days to go.
[00:08:35.863 --> 00:08:38.685]  You know, we've got momentum.
[00:08:38.805 --> 00:08:40.866]  They're trying to suppress it with suppression polls.
[00:08:40.906 --> 00:08:43.428]  They're sitting there going, you know, you guys are not going to have a red tsunami.
[00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.332]  What is your theory of the case here?
[00:08:47.113 --> 00:08:55.284]  Because you're a smart guy, do you really believe that they're going to try to pull out all stops in this regard, or does that hurt us playing into that narrative?
[00:08:55.364 --> 00:09:02.251]   Walk us through, because I know you're trying to accomplish exactly what we're trying to accomplish, which is To take the country back and to make sure we take it.
[00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:06.114]  We do the House and the Senate and then we get, I don't know if Trump back in or not.
[00:09:06.154 --> 00:09:09.616]  I know that you've got some very definitive thoughts about that.
[00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:10.916]  But we've got to win the House.
[00:09:10.936 --> 00:09:11.797]  We've got to win the Senate.
[00:09:11.837 --> 00:09:13.037]  We have to win these school boards.
[00:09:13.057 --> 00:09:14.418]  We have to win these state legislatures.
[00:09:14.738 --> 00:09:19.301]  So walk us through your theory of the case because we only got a 40 second clip on you from yesterday.
[00:09:20.942 --> 00:09:21.642]  And I apologize.
[00:09:21.682 --> 00:09:23.463]  I know you requested a full clip.
[00:09:23.663 --> 00:09:26.165]  I've spent basically an hour on that in my third hour yesterday.
[00:09:27.015 --> 00:09:29.924]  In context, I said that is something that is in.
[00:09:30.692 --> 00:09:54.725]  Their deck of cards, it's their ace of spades, is a provocateur, a false flag attack, or something like we saw with the staged Whitmer kidnapping situation a few years ago, with the same FBI group then going and running the provocateur on January 6, the same FBI group running the fake Russian dossier, and the same special FBI unit now raiding Mar-a-Lago a few weeks ago.
[00:09:54.805 --> 00:10:18.106]   So, we see the pre-programming of Puppet Biden, the third administration of Obama, In June of last year, putting out a new national terrorism directive saying questioning election fraud, questioning election results, or questioning lockdowns or forced inoculation is terrorism, or questioning critical race theory.
[00:10:18.146 --> 00:10:20.607]  That's officially in that national plan.
[00:10:20.647 --> 00:10:21.908]  And then we've seen them roll that out.
[00:10:22.268 --> 00:10:26.129]  We've seen the FBI say the number one terror threat is domestic right-wingers.
[00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.130]  They've now defined it as fascism.
[00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.799]   If you support President Trump, Or America first.
[00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.661]  And then now we start seeing headlines at the top of Drudge yesterday.
[00:10:34.322 --> 00:10:36.544]  You know, imminent Trump's calling for violence.
[00:10:36.584 --> 00:10:39.286]  Trump's calling for insurrection.
[00:10:39.627 --> 00:10:40.067]  January 6, 2.0.
[00:10:40.347 --> 00:10:43.350]  That's been all over the news building up.
[00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:52.834]   And Biden came out on Friday and said, I believe that Republicans are going to be violent in the next 74 days.
[00:10:52.874 --> 00:10:56.835]  Well now, yesterday was 71 days, now we're 70 days out.
[00:10:57.155 --> 00:11:13.301]  And if you look at all the pre-programming data points that are there, they're hyping this up and with their long history of Sirhan being a Patsy and all the other events we've seen where the FBI goes out and actually creates these terror groups.
[00:11:14.204 --> 00:11:16.386]  That is what I would do if I was them.
[00:11:16.466 --> 00:11:31.275]  And we know Bill Clinton on Air Force One in front of the huge press corps, right after he won re-election in 2000, in 1996, excuse me, said he owed his re-election when he was 10 points behind to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:11:31.336 --> 00:11:38.100]  And so they can use these type of tragic events as a pretext to demonize and try to basically outlaw their opposition.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.303]  That's why he's calling Republicans semi-fascist.
[00:11:43.157 --> 00:11:56.844]  Claiming that if we don't want dead people and illegal aliens voting, or all these electronic voting machines, or bailing ballots, that we're somehow fascist when they're the ones that are censoring, and suppressing, and raiding their political enemies.
[00:11:56.884 --> 00:12:14.551]   We now know the FBI admits Mark Zuckerberg told the truth last week on Joe Rogan when he said, the FBI came to us and said, do not have this story, it is election So they know there's a giant political realignment against
[00:12:14.551 --> 00:12:17.152]  globalism, neoliberalism around the world.
[00:12:17.152 --> 00:12:22.152]   And really the epicenter is the United States and places like Brazil with Bolsonaro.
[00:12:22.152 --> 00:12:26.152]   And they know they're losing support with the yellow vest and all these other movements.
[00:12:26.152 --> 00:12:31.562]   And so they know that austerity and the Great Reset that, as you pointed out, is an irreversible collapse if it goes
[00:12:31.562 --> 00:12:33.152]  much further, is unpopular.
[00:12:33.152 --> 00:12:38.152]   They're taking the gloves off and going to a pure authoritarian model.
[00:12:38.152 --> 00:12:42.152]  And I believe in the next 70 days it is their main move.
[00:12:42.152 --> 00:12:50.152]   And again, they pre-programmed it, pre-rolled it out, pre-advertised it to provocateur or stage some very serious massive events.
[00:12:50.152 --> 00:12:56.152]   It might be a new war. It might be, oh, hackers took down part of the power grid.
[00:12:56.152 --> 00:12:59.152]  It might not be a mass shooting. It might not be a bombing.
[00:12:59.152 --> 00:13:02.152]  But something big is going to happen.
[00:13:02.543 --> 00:13:04.385]  We're going to have a gigantic October surprise.
[00:13:04.425 --> 00:13:07.047]  What do you think?
[00:13:07.588 --> 00:13:11.170]  Let's put Biden's address to the nation.
[00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:16.335]  I don't know if the broadcast, it doesn't seem to me to be newsworthy because it's purely political.
[00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:19.777]  What do you expect out of him and how does that fit into your theory of the case?
[00:13:20.478 --> 00:13:24.379]  When he's calling... This is worse than Hillary Clinton calling us the deplorables.
[00:13:24.459 --> 00:13:28.861]  I mean, right now, I would argue that two-thirds of the nation back our policies.
[00:13:28.881 --> 00:13:35.603]  When we talk about inflation, immigration, crime, wokeness in schools, the economy, on our side of the... This is Ron Brownstein.
[00:13:35.883 --> 00:13:47.207]  On our side of the football versus theirs, climate change, whatever this thing of democracy, because we've got more votes than they have, and abortion.
[00:13:47.587 --> 00:13:49.348]  Brownstein's saying that's what's going to motivate them.
[00:13:50.228 --> 00:14:00.051]  Put in your theory of the case, where does Joe Biden's they're-all-fascist or semi-fascist fit in, and what do you anticipate he's going to tell the nation on Thursday night?
[00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:05.232]  Well, absolutely, what you just said is what he's going to say.
[00:14:05.611 --> 00:14:11.030]   he's going to say the republicans want to take your vote republicans will take your right to kill children
[00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:16.192]   republicans are evil they're bad and basically demonize the republican party
[00:14:16.192 --> 00:14:20.731]   top-down because the populist realignment happen through the republican party does the
[00:14:20.731 --> 00:14:21.990]   democratic party
[00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:25.391]   so he's gonna try to basically expand this idea
[00:14:25.391 --> 00:14:28.052]   of beginning to outlaw the political
[00:14:28.052 --> 00:14:31.211]   opposition and democrats have been talking about outlawing the republican
[00:14:31.211 --> 00:14:33.731]   party uh... we see them
[00:14:33.731 --> 00:14:36.751]   going around the country with gozer
[00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:41.690]   uh... and with green and with countless other races right here in texas
[00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:46.010]   uh... with members of congress the democrats are trying in court cases
[00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:51.471]   to bar multiple current members of congress and people running from
[00:14:51.471 --> 00:14:54.111]   congress to be able to not run because
[00:14:54.111 --> 00:15:03.650]   they questioned the the twenty twenty election And so they're trying to outlaw people running for office or being re-elected who question election fraud.
[00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.933]  Well, we send the State Department around the world.
[00:15:06.574 --> 00:15:08.675]  Uh, to try to make sure elections are free and fair.
[00:15:09.015 --> 00:15:16.759]  And if you measure up US elections to elections in the third world that they say are fraudulent, we're way fraudulent than them by every yardstick.
[00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:21.342]  So they're trying to outlaw questioning elections and barring people from running.
[00:15:21.602 --> 00:15:23.463]  That's the greatest form of blocking.
[00:15:24.083 --> 00:15:31.591]  The electoral process and blocking voters will and then turning around he's going to have an address and say that the Republicans are fascist.
[00:15:32.111 --> 00:15:39.919]  They don't want dead people and illegal aliens voting and they don't want mail-in ballots the same way we know they stole the 2020 election.
[00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:59.757]   So it's going to be a declaration of war and expansion of the ongoing declaration of war not just against America's energy Not just our borders, not just our sovereignty, not just our currency, not just the value of our dollar, but a further declaration of war against anyone questioning any of their fraudulent narratives that are collapsing.
[00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:07.802]  I want to talk about, I'm going to get to the FBI in a second, but I want to talk about these executive orders that you bring up, the one about the voting and the previous one.
[00:16:08.263 --> 00:16:23.516]  Do you believe that Republican attorney generals and the Republican Party elected officials have done enough to expose what those executive orders were, what they really say, and to combat them, even at a state attorney general level, to contest what these executive orders are?
[00:16:23.536 --> 00:16:26.899]  Well, it's like you said a few days ago.
[00:16:27.865 --> 00:16:29.785]  Our biggest problem is not even the Democrats.
[00:16:30.045 --> 00:16:40.608]  They're unpopular, they're criminal, they're disgusting, but the Republican leadership will not get on the ramparts, will not defend the gates, will not cover any real issues.
[00:16:40.768 --> 00:16:42.148]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:08.708]  And now we go back to the interview from yesterday between Steve Bannon and Alex Jones.
[00:18:08.848 --> 00:18:09.188]  Here it is.
[00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:12.470]  Our biggest problem is not even the Democrats.
[00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:22.413]  They're unpopular, they're criminal, they're disgusting, but the Republican leadership will not get on the ramparts, will not defend the gates, will not cover any real issues.
[00:18:22.433 --> 00:18:30.876]  They talk about small business stimulation packages that don't even pass and things that are not on people's radar.
[00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:32.616]  They're not talking about inflation.
[00:18:33.297 --> 00:18:36.278]  They're not even talking about human smuggling and open borders like they should.
[00:18:36.298 --> 00:18:38.839]  They're not talking about election fraud.
[00:18:38.859 --> 00:18:43.414]   They're not talking about Any of the real things that concern Americans.
[00:18:43.434 --> 00:18:57.140]  They're not talking about the military still being forcibly inoculated, or illegal aliens can pour in by the millions and not even be given COVID tests or COVID shots, which I don't think they should be given COVID shots, but then Djokovic can't come here for the U.S.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:57.460]  Open.
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:15.437]   The Republicans need to get on the offense, but the Republican rhino establishment is working with the Democrat Party establishment to fend off the populist, peaceful, Political insurrection that has been taking the country and the world by storm.
[00:19:15.517 --> 00:19:17.618]  They are fighting us.
[00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:22.939]   They are attempting to bankrupt America, to bring people to their knees in a giant cloud
[00:19:22.939 --> 00:19:29.079]   and priven great reset model so that we're so poor and so destitute we've got to accept
[00:19:29.079 --> 00:19:36.378]   a communist socialist model with a high tech technocracy, global ID, global carbon tax,
[00:19:36.378 --> 00:19:39.918]  global social credit score, global universal basic income.
[00:19:39.918 --> 00:19:45.599]   They're bringing down the old system that they've already sucked dry, poses the saviors
[00:19:45.599 --> 00:19:47.218]  as they bring in their new tyranny.
[00:19:47.218 --> 00:19:51.638]   That's why the climate we're in, it's not like five years ago or 30 years ago or 40
[00:19:51.638 --> 00:19:53.038]  years ago.
[00:19:53.038 --> 00:19:59.079]   It's closer to the climate we had during the Civil War where there's major competing factions
[00:19:59.079 --> 00:20:03.479]   battling over control of this country and they want the populist faction out of the
[00:20:03.479 --> 00:20:06.918]  game, basically outlawed and labeled as terrorists.
[00:20:07.237 --> 00:20:08.158]  It's not going to work though.
[00:20:08.178 --> 00:20:11.619]  That's why I warned the establishment that they really need to study history.
[00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:23.068]  And look at what they've done and understand that drag queen story time and critical race theory has turned the country and really the world against them and that they should sue for peace.
[00:20:23.448 --> 00:20:24.509]  They should back down.
[00:20:24.809 --> 00:20:27.632]  They should not try to accelerate us into a civil war.
[00:20:27.652 --> 00:20:28.673]  But you see it all over the news.
[00:20:28.953 --> 00:20:29.974]  Civil war imminent.
[00:20:30.434 --> 00:20:31.915]  We're going to have a war with the Republicans.
[00:20:31.935 --> 00:20:33.196]  We're going to have a war with the populace.
[00:20:33.396 --> 00:20:34.437]  We're going to arrest Trump.
[00:20:34.517 --> 00:20:35.138]  Lindsey Graham.
[00:20:35.438 --> 00:20:37.179]  If you arrest Trump, there's going to be a civil war.
[00:20:37.199 --> 00:20:38.881]  There's going to be war on the streets.
[00:20:39.461 --> 00:20:42.282]  I don't, if they do arrest Trump, I don't want war on the streets.
[00:20:42.902 --> 00:20:51.886]  I want total political realignment to the next level, and we should talk about peaceful ways to not let them, Steve, provocateur us into violence.
[00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:53.871]  This is my point.
[00:20:53.931 --> 00:20:59.937]  Lindsey Graham and these guys who are never with us, for him to say that, because right now the momentum is on our side.
[00:21:00.037 --> 00:21:13.949]  Everything they're trying to do, from the suppression polls, to divert the conversation over to civil war, to all of this, gets us off the target, which is the target is November 8th in a sweeping, we could break the Democratic Party as a national political institution from the school vote.
[00:21:13.989 --> 00:21:15.251]  You guys have seen this in Texas.
[00:21:15.751 --> 00:21:21.375]  From what DeSantis has done in Florida, from the school boards, all the way up to the state legislatures, to the House and the Senate.
[00:21:21.795 --> 00:21:22.996]  They're trying to divert our attention.
[00:21:23.396 --> 00:21:30.521]  What would you tell the people out there that follow you, given the fact that they're going to use information warfare like they've never done before?
[00:21:30.661 --> 00:21:31.882]  You're I-Corps commander.
[00:21:32.422 --> 00:21:45.471]  We're going to get to the book in the next break, but right now, what should the people that follow Alex Jones, and the people that say, hey look, this guy's smart and tough, and he's one of our leaders, what is your advice to the populist movement right now?
[00:21:47.212 --> 00:21:54.355]  I would tell every person watching this to share this broadcast while it's live and later when it's archived.
[00:21:55.155 --> 00:22:00.677]  And I would have them send it to all of their liberal friends and leftist friends and say, how long are you going to be a chump?
[00:22:01.337 --> 00:22:03.298]  How long are you going to be a fool?
[00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:08.780]  Even if you're unable to vote in this election because of changing over parties, a lot of states can still do it.
[00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:11.282]  You need to understand you're going to be bankrupt.
[00:22:11.902 --> 00:22:14.783]  You're going to have no future if you don't wake up.
[00:22:15.578 --> 00:22:24.163]  To the fact that some very criminal, multinational corporations are using the Democratic Party to basically have a hostile corporate takeover of this country.
[00:22:24.243 --> 00:22:45.270]   Then, I would go out to every relative, every friend, every family, every employee, every boss, every stranger, and I would tell them, you need to go vote and you need to not just count on there being a red tsunami because there's going to be a blue election fraud firewall or or seawall
[00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.152]   that's going to try to block that but we know from the studies
[00:22:48.152 --> 00:22:52.480]   places like texas and florida they run out of dead people and they run out of illegals on
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.971]   the ballot uh... able to vote very very quickly and they hit a wall
[00:22:56.971 --> 00:23:01.852]   so we've got a counter them with absolute total and complete
[00:23:01.852 --> 00:23:05.881]   voting okay sure i think i reach a lot of voters being on air myself why don't
[00:23:05.881 --> 00:23:08.310]   you go vote well because every vote counts
[00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:12.797]   and even if you think your state's red it's not for long We have to crush them now.
[00:23:13.397 --> 00:23:17.739]  Everybody watching has to go to their city council, their school board, even if we don't have children.
[00:23:18.019 --> 00:23:19.259]  You've got to go to the county commission.
[00:23:19.739 --> 00:23:21.660]  People are watching those commissions.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.801]  Those hearings go out, they get picked up, they go viral.
[00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:25.821]  Everyone.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:36.287]  Especially America's veterans, because this is the real fight for the Republic itself, must go every week to every televised hearing, whether you're in a small town or a big city.
[00:23:36.747 --> 00:23:38.068]  Everyone must call C-SPAN.
[00:23:38.428 --> 00:23:40.149]  Everyone must call on the liberal talk radio.
[00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:46.654]  Everyone must understand that this is a massive historic crossroads, and the enemies of freedom know that.
[00:23:46.674 --> 00:23:57.422]   We need a maximum effort To go out and to study the ballot and to vote for good people and to just do everything we can to just have such a giant red wave they can't stop us.
[00:23:58.663 --> 00:23:59.623]  Alex, hang on one second.
[00:23:59.964 --> 00:24:01.905]  The great reset in the war for the world.
[00:24:02.425 --> 00:24:04.947]  The central battlefield is the United States of America.
[00:24:05.067 --> 00:24:06.388]  All next in the War Room.
[00:24:07.229 --> 00:24:08.990]  We will fight till they're all gone.
[00:24:09.791 --> 00:24:11.352]  We rejoice when there's no more.
[00:24:11.392 --> 00:24:13.153]  Let's take down the CCP.
[00:24:14.565 --> 00:24:15.085]  War Room.
[00:24:15.566 --> 00:24:16.247]  Pandemic.
[00:24:16.567 --> 00:24:17.788]  With Stephen K. Bannon.
[00:24:18.128 --> 00:24:21.612]  The epidemic is a demon, and we cannot let this demon hide.
[00:24:21.992 --> 00:24:22.492]  War Room.
[00:24:23.013 --> 00:24:23.714]  Pandemic.
[00:24:23.794 --> 00:24:27.777]  Here's your host, Stephen K. Bannon.
[00:24:28.999 --> 00:24:29.819]  Okay, thank you very much.
[00:24:29.859 --> 00:24:32.522]  By the way, as soon as we get that, uh, that ad, I want to play that.
[00:24:32.582 --> 00:24:32.942]  We got it?
[00:24:33.002 --> 00:24:33.263]  Let's go.
[00:24:33.303 --> 00:24:36.345]  I tell you what, Alex, before I bring you back in, I got to play this, because it's so powerful.
[00:24:36.366 --> 00:24:36.666]  Let's hit it.
[00:24:41.118 --> 00:24:51.586]  I gotta tell you, this book, The Great Reset and The War for the World, the left and the mainstream media are going to have to sit there, and we've got to force them to respond to this book.
[00:24:52.386 --> 00:24:54.067]  This book is that important.
[00:24:54.107 --> 00:24:56.049]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter.
[00:24:56.409 --> 00:25:10.018]   If you compare the finest, and I'm telling you, you take MIT Technology Review, you take Science, take all these magazines and journals, add the electronic part of it, and, you know, NPR, PBS, all of it, I'll take it.
[00:25:10.138 --> 00:25:17.180]  I'll match up and I will go through and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:22.481]  And if you're a sentient human being and just welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:25:22.541 --> 00:25:31.464]  We are going back to the interview that was held yesterday on Steve Bannon's war room pandemic, Alex Jones and Steve Bannon, two powerhouses in the alternative.
[00:25:32.464 --> 00:25:41.351]  Right information sphere coming together to face off against our common enemy, the globalist scumbags that are destroying this country and the entire world.
[00:25:41.511 --> 00:25:42.031]  Here it is.
[00:25:42.051 --> 00:25:44.393]  Without any further ado, Alex Jones and Steve Bannon.
[00:25:46.778 --> 00:25:48.319]  Okay, Alex Jones is my guest.
[00:25:48.339 --> 00:25:49.199]  You're in the War Room.
[00:25:49.679 --> 00:25:52.840]  It's the 30th of August in the year of Our Lord 2022.
[00:25:52.961 --> 00:26:02.084]  Alex, I think you've done a pretty good job of forcing them to read it, given how you've walked through what you anticipate they're up to in the next 70 days.
[00:26:04.245 --> 00:26:16.389]  Because your book makes the case that the United States of America, this beloved constitutional republic we were bequeathed, is the central battlefield on this global reset in the war for the world.
[00:26:16.409 --> 00:26:17.429]  Can you explain that, sir?
[00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:27.112]  And I want to add in the developments that have happened with the FBI agents over the last 24 hours, how that fits into your theory of the case as you lay it out in this book.
[00:26:27.152 --> 00:26:34.339]   And this book is, for the people that hate Alex Jones the most for the people who think he's a charlatan and a carny barker.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.564]  I strongly recommend that you read this book.
[00:26:37.844 --> 00:26:46.076]  You may still hate him at the end of it, but you will respect the intellectual integrity of this book because it's a very very powerful document.
[00:26:46.156 --> 00:26:46.657]  Alex Jones.
[00:26:48.376 --> 00:26:49.477]  Well, Steve, I appreciate that.
[00:26:49.497 --> 00:26:50.877]  And look, I'm on the air four hours a day.
[00:26:50.917 --> 00:26:52.018]  I've been on the air 28 years.
[00:26:52.198 --> 00:26:53.979]  I screw around and have some fun sometimes.
[00:26:54.599 --> 00:26:55.700]  It gets taken out of context.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:04.804]  I hate myself sometimes, but I don't really joke around and have fun anymore the last few years because the world is so serious now as they're having trouble, you know, finding the satire to take it out of context.
[00:27:04.844 --> 00:27:11.368]  But getting back to your point about why they have to take America out, it's what Ronald Reagan told us.
[00:27:11.868 --> 00:27:39.436]   Ronald Reagan wasn't perfect getting conservative Ideas through he got a lot of things done that were good some things that were bad but Reagan made the world love America and made the world love American ideals of private property and family and freedom of religion and capitalism and security and peace through strength and he was an ambassador to the world the world absolutely Loved America.
[00:27:39.856 --> 00:27:45.485]   We were at the pinnacle of our strength at the end of World War two and And then again with Ronald Reagan.
[00:27:45.605 --> 00:27:50.928]  And then since then, it's been our presidents pretty much selling us out to globalism until Trump comes along.
[00:27:51.208 --> 00:27:58.792]  And then Trump makes it about America again, because how can America be a leader in the world if it's not free and successful and powerful?
[00:27:58.872 --> 00:28:12.987]   So if we're bringing in a worldwide corporate panopticonic surveillance, mark of the beast, control freak, mad scientist run, great reset, build back better, depopulation
[00:28:12.987 --> 00:28:14.336]  nightmare.
[00:28:14.336 --> 00:28:19.135]   You can't have a free country like the United States of America
[00:28:19.135 --> 00:28:25.437]   that's an example to others to aspire to as a model, just like our Constitution became the model of the world.
[00:28:25.437 --> 00:28:30.136]   They want communist China and its authoritarianism and its death camps
[00:28:30.136 --> 00:28:37.986]   and the Uyghurs and forced labor and 16-hour workdays and the government turning your power off when they want,
[00:28:37.986 --> 00:28:39.076]  and social credit scores.
[00:28:39.581 --> 00:28:41.281]  They want that to be the model.
[00:28:41.581 --> 00:28:50.383]  These multinational Fortune 500, pretty much to a company, allied with Communist China to parlay that power into their world government.
[00:28:50.876 --> 00:28:56.397]  Now Russia's got its own problems, and I'm not lionizing Russia, but it's trying to be its own sovereign nation.
[00:28:56.778 --> 00:28:58.958]  That's why it's public enemy number one as a country.
[00:28:59.458 --> 00:29:04.420]  But the United States, and what it was, and what it could be, is the real number one enemy.
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:13.942]  Russia becomes a junior enemy when you pull back and realize everything is to undermine the country, everything is to destroy confidence, everything is to break up our families.
[00:29:14.302 --> 00:29:15.703]  Everything is to destroy our veterans.
[00:29:16.043 --> 00:29:17.364]  Everything is to ship in fentanyl.
[00:29:17.724 --> 00:29:20.665]  It's all about demoralizing us to break our will.
[00:29:21.145 --> 00:29:23.747]  Then they can get control of our science and our military.
[00:29:23.767 --> 00:29:37.093]  And once they believe they have a godless, authoritarian America, now we will make Nazi Germany look like a choir boy compared to what the New World Order can do once America falls and becomes an absolute tyranny.
[00:29:37.273 --> 00:29:41.495]  So the war for the world, the epicenter is the United States of America.
[00:29:41.935 --> 00:29:48.417]   And so that's why I titled it The Great Reset and the World for the World.
[00:29:48.838 --> 00:29:49.638]  Everybody should go.
[00:29:49.678 --> 00:29:50.599]  It's on sale.
[00:29:50.939 --> 00:29:55.981]  I don't know if bookstores are going to stock this, but definitely it's on Amazon and you can go to your site.
[00:29:56.021 --> 00:29:57.242]  So everybody should get it today.
[00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:57.943]  You should read it.
[00:29:57.963 --> 00:30:03.946]  I want to go to one of the central theses is about decarbonization, deindustrialization, depopulation.
[00:30:04.686 --> 00:30:10.670]  But you make the case about wokeness, and also your work over the last 20 years in transhumanism.
[00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:17.474]  Tie that together in the Great Reset, and why is this actually the underpinnings of what this fight's about?
[00:30:19.555 --> 00:30:27.900]  Well, George Orwell's real name was Eric Blair, and he'd been a top communist and a top Fabian socialist, and he'd fought against Hitler in the Spanish Civil War, and he believed in it.
[00:30:28.624 --> 00:30:36.790]  And then he learned how evil Stalin was, and so he wrote a book in 1984 about what the world would look like if Stalin's revolution succeeded.
[00:30:37.550 --> 00:31:10.260]   And in the book, it's really about destroying language, destroying words, outlawing words, making people scared of what they said, what they did, and that's what wokeness is, is giving Hollywood and the Democratic Party and the globalists control over language, control over every facet of society, to then bring in old tyrannies Like discriminating against somebody off of what color they are, something the West got rid of, they turn our greatest strength around against us, and now, oh, we're going to fire the white teachers because they're white.
[00:31:11.081 --> 00:31:14.322]  We're going to not have white airline pilots because there's too many white people.
[00:31:14.843 --> 00:31:24.848]  These are authoritarian mainstays, but now inverted, so it's a corporate authoritarianism masquerading as neoliberalism.
[00:31:25.612 --> 00:31:29.313]  And so they need us to say two men can have a baby, two women can have a baby.
[00:31:29.674 --> 00:31:34.175]  They need us to believe that we can be a dog if we want to.
[00:31:34.395 --> 00:31:36.896]  The furries phenomenon and Brad Queen story time.
[00:31:37.296 --> 00:31:42.899]  They have to get us to accept outrageous things because they want us to accept human-animal hybrids.
[00:31:42.919 --> 00:31:44.919]  They want us to accept human clones.
[00:31:45.439 --> 00:31:46.480]  They're already growing for organs.
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:51.902]  They want us to accept no bar, no control, no governor.
[00:31:53.101 --> 00:31:54.101]  on what these people can do.
[00:31:54.141 --> 00:31:55.462]  And Elon Musk has talked about that.
[00:31:55.842 --> 00:31:58.723]  He says, beware of billionaires that worship AI gods.
[00:31:59.483 --> 00:32:02.944]  And he's explained, if we don't have 2.2 children, civilization will collapse.
[00:32:02.964 --> 00:32:04.725]  They're building an anti-human civilization.
[00:32:05.145 --> 00:32:07.286]  He's come out and says he wants a pro-human civilization.
[00:32:07.606 --> 00:32:13.508]  He's not against cybernetic augmentation, if you choose it, if it's not forced on you, and if it helps you.
[00:32:13.808 --> 00:32:17.869]  My uncle was in a motorcycle wreck 30 years ago, had really bad epilepsy.
[00:32:18.189 --> 00:32:20.170]  He got one of those Vega nerve stimulators.
[00:32:20.894 --> 00:32:22.195]  Basically stopped having seizures.
[00:32:22.655 --> 00:32:23.456]  Then that failed.
[00:32:23.916 --> 00:32:26.057]  Three years ago, he actually got a more advanced brain chip.
[00:32:26.457 --> 00:32:27.318]  Doesn't have seizures.
[00:32:27.998 --> 00:32:28.979]  Not in a wheelchair anymore.
[00:32:29.379 --> 00:32:29.899]  Lives great.
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:30.900]  Has a great life.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.521]  That brain chip's a wonderful thing.
[00:32:32.561 --> 00:32:33.441]  I'm not against progress.
[00:32:34.362 --> 00:32:37.224]  But we don't want to make people take brain chips.
[00:32:37.244 --> 00:32:40.205]  So, there's all these opportunities with all this technology.
[00:32:40.466 --> 00:32:50.301]   We just don't want it to be tied to a global social credit score and to have the head of the Davos Group say, soon school children by 2030 We'll have a chip in the brain to communicate.
[00:32:50.661 --> 00:32:56.623]  And if you don't have chip, you won't be able to... I mean, this is what they're saying, and it's an attack on free will.
[00:32:56.683 --> 00:33:02.385]  So, wokeism is about just getting us to stand on our head, or if they say jump, we say, how high?
[00:33:03.433 --> 00:33:11.100]  To accept absurdity, so then we hand over our personal authority to the technocrats, to the transhumanists.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.243]  This whole revolution isn't liberal, it's not communist.
[00:33:14.483 --> 00:33:15.944]  They use that as their control mechanism.
[00:33:16.365 --> 00:33:22.931]  It is a transhumanist, mad scientist, power grab of the future, the great reset, the war for the world.
[00:33:24.204 --> 00:33:25.484]  Okay, the book is out today.
[00:33:25.504 --> 00:33:26.825]  You can get it on Amazon.
[00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:28.005]  It's a must-read.
[00:33:28.465 --> 00:33:31.166]  Alex, I know you're jammed, but I want to just hold you through the break.
[00:33:31.226 --> 00:33:33.667]  I've got just one or two questions on the other side.
[00:33:33.687 --> 00:33:33.767]  Sure.
[00:33:33.787 --> 00:33:46.270]  We're also going to be joined by Brandon Showalter from the Christian Post about this blockbuster investigative reporting on the Children's Hospital up in Boston, Boston Children's Hospital, the reality of what they've been doing as far as surgeries go.
[00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:50.614]  Also, Joe Allen, our editor for Transhumanism, is also going to join us.
[00:33:51.374 --> 00:34:00.602]  He's going to make some comments and observations on what Alex Jones has been working on for many decades, and also he was the one that really got deeply into this Boston Children's Hospital story.
[00:34:00.622 --> 00:34:02.243]  So we're going to take a short commercial break.
[00:34:02.504 --> 00:34:05.006]  We return, we've got the one and only Alex Jones.
[00:34:05.466 --> 00:34:12.372]  The book is The Great Reset and the War for the World, and he's making the case that the central battlefield is the United States of America.
[00:34:12.192 --> 00:34:14.192]  We're going to return in the war room in just a moment.
[00:34:14.192 --> 00:34:22.192]  [Music]
[00:34:22.192 --> 00:34:28.780]   Alright folks, we are going to return on the other side as well to finish up that interview between Steve Bannon and
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:29.192]  Alex Jones.
[00:34:30.065 --> 00:34:32.148]  The book is called The Great Reset and The War for the World.
[00:34:32.228 --> 00:34:34.711]  It's available now on InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:34:34.731 --> 00:34:39.017]  You can also buy it on Amazon, one of the rare times that we actually encourage you to go use.
[00:34:39.858 --> 00:34:45.143]  Sauron's delivery service, but drive it up the charts, get the book to number one.
[00:34:45.263 --> 00:34:46.624]  That exposes it to more people.
[00:34:46.704 --> 00:34:52.789]  It's using the weapons of the enemy against them and to spread the information that destroys their lies.
[00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:58.174]  So, InfoWarsTore.com, purchase some products or get the book at Amazon and help us drive it up the charts.
[00:34:58.194 --> 00:34:59.715]  We'll be back to finish up that interview.
[00:35:00.516 --> 00:35:01.337]  Alright, welcome back.
[00:35:01.477 --> 00:35:04.379]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:35:04.519 --> 00:35:12.925]  You're watching us on Infowars.com, band.video, or however you're watching us, congratulations on circumventing the censorship and finding the truth.
[00:35:14.957 --> 00:35:28.224]  And we're going to go back now to that interview between Steve Bannon and Alex Jones about the book The Grey Reset and the War for the World about transhumanism and the ultimate goals that those transhumanists have for the rest of us.
[00:35:28.244 --> 00:35:36.189]  We're going to go back to that now and finish up with this interview before Owen Schroyer comes in and takes over the show for the second hour.
[00:35:36.229 --> 00:35:39.811]  But here's the rest of Steve Bannon and Alex Jones talking yesterday.
[00:35:41.457 --> 00:35:42.858]  Okay, our guest is Alex Jones.
[00:35:42.998 --> 00:35:58.252]  Alex, Napoleon used to tell his marshals, the marshals of France, and particularly after a couple of big engagements, he said, when you set out to take Vienna, take Vienna, what is your message now to the populist nationalist movement in this country?
[00:35:59.193 --> 00:36:16.047]  inclusive nationalism, regardless of your race or your ethnicity, in particular those hard-working Hispanic Americans down the rear of Grand Valley in South Texas, in your beloved state, also in Arizona, California, all throughout the country, African-American men, particularly men that are turned off by this wokeness.
[00:36:16.227 --> 00:36:19.029]  What is your message for the next 70 days, sir?
[00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:27.536]  My message is, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, the Democratic Party, the New World Order, they're a global party of authoritarianism.
[00:36:28.169 --> 00:36:31.071]  It's the same in Australia, the same in Germany, the same in France, the same here.
[00:36:31.091 --> 00:36:35.653]  We need to join Bolsonaro, we need to join Viktor Orban, we need to join other leaders around the world.
[00:36:35.673 --> 00:36:37.334]  We need to get Trump re-elected.
[00:36:37.814 --> 00:36:46.899]  We need to realize that we are being enslaved by corporate fascism masquerading as neoliberalism, and you've got to be 100% all in.
[00:36:47.199 --> 00:37:04.078]   Because if you think 49% increases in electricity prices last year is bad, if you think gas prices doubling the last two years is bad, if you think any of this is bad, The globalists admit they want to bankrupt us and bring us to our knees permanently.
[00:37:04.358 --> 00:37:06.798]  They have horrible plans for the average American.
[00:37:07.118 --> 00:37:08.479]  This is life and death.
[00:37:08.719 --> 00:37:09.439]  This isn't a game.
[00:37:09.739 --> 00:37:21.902]  As Steve Bannon said a few days ago, and all the actuaries show it, already the lockdowns the last two and a half years, already the regulations, already what's been done has put us into a collapse.
[00:37:22.979 --> 00:37:24.000]  The plane's crashing.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.741]  The question is, can it be a survivable crash landing?
[00:37:27.042 --> 00:37:28.683]  We need to get these people out of there now.
[00:37:29.063 --> 00:37:31.524]  We need to get rid of the Klaus Schwabs that are in control of our government.
[00:37:31.544 --> 00:37:34.246]  He brags he's in control of our government, the Canadian government.
[00:37:34.506 --> 00:37:35.647]  He penetrates the governments.
[00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:43.412]  We have to stop them, get them out of control of our system, and then try to crash land the airplane.
[00:37:43.492 --> 00:37:46.654]  Or if you think things are bad now, folks, you have not seen anything yet.
[00:37:46.774 --> 00:37:54.980]   This is a real global corporate technocrat Takeover for economic and cultural warfare of America and the world.
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:58.182]  This is the war for the world and people better choose a side.
[00:37:58.543 --> 00:38:02.326]  Freedom and justice and prosperity or total destruction.
[00:38:02.506 --> 00:38:05.308]  The Democratic Party is literally run by international criminals.
[00:38:05.568 --> 00:38:07.050]  They're literally run by the CCP.
[00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:08.611]  It's in Hunter Biden's laptop.
[00:38:09.211 --> 00:38:16.355]  And we now know this head FBI guy got marched out two days ago and you know fired because we now know that it's been declassified.
[00:38:16.415 --> 00:38:18.956]  He ordered the Hunter laptop sealed.
[00:38:19.397 --> 00:38:21.578]  He ordered them to threaten the media not to cover it.
[00:38:21.838 --> 00:38:32.744]  He ordered it put in a secret file so nobody could see it and it's only because of a bunch of good FBI agents that lost their jobs or were put on leave.
[00:38:33.519 --> 00:38:34.819]  That we even know about this.
[00:38:34.879 --> 00:38:36.160]  So the FBI is not our enemy.
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.280]  The people running it though are an enemy.
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:42.061]  And we're never going to fix it until we have taken the whole government back over.
[00:38:42.282 --> 00:38:45.462]  And I think we have to break up these federal agencies once and for all.
[00:38:45.722 --> 00:38:51.824]  Because you can't have one central national police force like the FBI.
[00:38:51.884 --> 00:38:54.545]  But we are at such a historic crossroads.
[00:38:54.865 --> 00:38:56.245]  And it's all coming out in the open.
[00:38:56.506 --> 00:38:58.006]  And the globalists have lost.
[00:38:58.606 --> 00:39:01.367]  Their only hope is to smash and collapse everything.
[00:39:02.057 --> 00:39:05.447]  Before the people actually wake up and bring them to justice.
[00:39:05.467 --> 00:39:12.845]   They hope the collapse creates such a giant Smokescreen and such a fog of war that somehow they slink away.
[00:39:13.145 --> 00:39:15.127]  I've looked at every possible development in that.
[00:39:15.387 --> 00:39:16.928]  They're never getting away with what they've done.
[00:39:17.248 --> 00:39:25.075]  The question is, do they want to just run off with their money now and we'll, you know, put them in abstentia like Napoleon?
[00:39:25.575 --> 00:39:31.400]  Or if they come creeping back and try another war with us, they're going to actually get put in prison for the rest of their lives.
[00:39:31.741 --> 00:39:34.801]   I would be happy for some of these globalists To slink off.
[00:39:35.221 --> 00:39:36.644]  Because I understand how dangerous they are.
[00:39:36.664 --> 00:39:41.935]  And I understand this is going to really cause world war, you name it, if it keeps going down this road.
[00:39:42.677 --> 00:39:45.142]  So I would, I would say if I was Trump.
[00:39:45.774 --> 00:39:53.119]  He should do a big televised speech and offer them amnesty, offer them pardon, if they just put up their hands and give up and stop now.
[00:39:53.419 --> 00:39:54.520]  Because they're identified.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.080]  The New World Order is out in the open.
[00:39:56.361 --> 00:39:57.601]  The Great Reset's out in the open.
[00:39:57.882 --> 00:39:59.303]  More and more people learn about it every day.
[00:39:59.703 --> 00:40:00.843]  Everybody's turning against them.
[00:40:01.104 --> 00:40:04.726]  They should just give up and come out with their hands up now, and we will give them a good deal.
[00:40:06.261 --> 00:40:17.871]  Alex, for those people that are hearing you for the first time and haven't had a chance to get to the show, given that they've tried to de-platform you everywhere, how do people get to the Alex Jones Show and get to watch it in real time?
[00:40:18.111 --> 00:40:18.592]  Where do they go?
[00:40:18.892 --> 00:40:19.773]  Thanks for that, Steve.
[00:40:19.813 --> 00:40:20.033]  Yeah.
[00:40:20.734 --> 00:40:48.136]   You know, just like we have to go back to where it's on URLs and people go to those destinations, we don't count on the big CCP allied globalist operations, you go to infowars.com We're just on the front page, there's audio and video, the live show, the archives, and then my show, all the shows, hundreds of other band creators and researchers and filmmakers are at band.video, just the word band, and then .video, you can find it all.
[00:40:49.105 --> 00:40:52.186]  At Infowars.com, but I just hope people go to Amazon.com.
[00:40:52.306 --> 00:40:55.847]  I'm not a big Jeff Bezos fan, but we've made this book go to number six.
[00:40:56.267 --> 00:40:56.987]  It was you, by the way.
[00:40:57.327 --> 00:40:58.868]  On my own show, I can make it go to like number 50.
[00:40:59.588 --> 00:41:03.029]  But when you, the last two times we had you on, your audience is incredible.
[00:41:03.449 --> 00:41:11.231]  Steve, when you said we need to make this number one, it went to number six one time, number nine another, all because of your great audience of activists.
[00:41:11.251 --> 00:41:15.613]  Folks, we want to push this book to number one in the world.
[00:41:15.673 --> 00:41:16.973]  It's already ahead of Obama's book.
[00:41:17.453 --> 00:41:20.874]  And Michelle Obama's book, it's already ahead of Harari's book.
[00:41:21.594 --> 00:41:25.735]  But we want to push it to number one, and I thank the War Room and its great audience.
[00:41:25.875 --> 00:41:32.877]  And Steve, I sleep better at night knowing you're there, because there's not many people that have a giant grasp of how this works.
[00:41:33.297 --> 00:41:43.299]  And I've been tuning to your show for years, and obviously watching you for years before that, but you really have an even greater understanding in many ways than I do, and I'm very thankful you're there, and I just really appreciate you.
[00:41:44.582 --> 00:41:45.703]  No, you're I-Corps Commander.
[00:41:45.903 --> 00:41:49.765]  You understood that a big part of this was information war 30 years ago before people did.
[00:41:49.825 --> 00:41:50.426]  It's amazing.
[00:41:51.226 --> 00:41:52.247]  You've got to go to Amazon.
[00:41:52.307 --> 00:41:54.548]  We need to make this book, number one, to make a statement.
[00:41:55.048 --> 00:41:57.910]  But most importantly, you're not going to be able to put this book down.
[00:41:57.970 --> 00:41:58.731]  It's not a beach read.
[00:41:58.871 --> 00:41:59.571]  This is a tough read.
[00:41:59.591 --> 00:42:00.071]  Get a pen.
[00:42:00.091 --> 00:42:00.792]  You're going to underline.
[00:42:00.812 --> 00:42:01.632]  You're going to take notes.
[00:42:01.692 --> 00:42:02.433]  Get a notepad.
[00:42:02.553 --> 00:42:03.634]  You're going to jot stuff down.
[00:42:04.554 --> 00:42:05.595]  Get questions to us.
[00:42:05.615 --> 00:42:06.876]  We'll get questions back to Alex.
[00:42:06.916 --> 00:42:08.677]  I'm sure he's going to give other talks on this.
[00:42:09.177 --> 00:42:10.097]  Today's the first day of the book.
[00:42:10.117 --> 00:42:11.218]  And Steve, here's the thing, just real quick.
[00:42:11.418 --> 00:42:11.698]  Yes, sir.
[00:42:13.425 --> 00:42:23.552]  When people read this book, because I just read it again the other day, even though I wrote it, when you watch the news, you hear the slogans of the Democrats and then other liberal leaders.
[00:42:23.572 --> 00:42:28.175]  I mean, this is a global corporate fascist party masquerading as leftist.
[00:42:28.495 --> 00:42:29.976]  I mean, this is their blueprint, folks.
[00:42:29.996 --> 00:42:31.637]  This is the blueprint of the Death Star.
[00:42:31.897 --> 00:42:32.638]  Please get it today.
[00:42:32.838 --> 00:42:33.899]  Steve Bannon, thank you.
[00:42:34.784 --> 00:42:39.806]  No, no, I tell you, this is what the brains of Tony Lyons and the guys at Skyhorse is to drop it 70 days ago.
[00:42:39.826 --> 00:42:46.288]  Because I tell people, if you get it, you read it over the Labor Day weekend or the next couple of days, the framing, you'll hear stuff.
[00:42:46.328 --> 00:42:53.191]  And particularly, I want the people that have never listened to Alex Jones or never read a word or never gone to the site and gotten any of the stories to get this.
[00:42:53.211 --> 00:42:54.351]  This is the audience we need to get it.
[00:42:54.431 --> 00:42:56.512]  Get the book and just make your own judgment.
[00:42:56.572 --> 00:42:59.533]  Weigh and measure it yourself and then just, you know, use it as a framework.
[00:42:59.713 --> 00:43:03.397]  Other information will come in, and you'll see the great reset in the war for the world.
[00:43:03.497 --> 00:43:03.957]  Alex, thanks.
[00:43:04.037 --> 00:43:04.898]  I know you're busy today.
[00:43:04.938 --> 00:43:05.819]  Thanks for taking time.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.723]  The book's going to be huge, and we look forward to having you back on.
[00:43:10.884 --> 00:43:11.185]  Thank you.
[00:43:11.205 --> 00:43:11.925]  Please come on my show.
[00:43:11.965 --> 00:43:12.726]  I know you're busy as well.
[00:43:12.766 --> 00:43:13.147]  Thank you, sir.
[00:43:14.228 --> 00:43:14.548]  Thank you.
[00:43:14.648 --> 00:43:15.169]  Alex Jones.
[00:43:16.056 --> 00:43:24.618]  It really is nice to see, folks, these two titans of dissident politics come together and be so supportive of one another.
[00:43:24.818 --> 00:43:29.920]  And I'll tell you, this book, we have a couple, a few copies sitting around the office.
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:32.060]  They're a little bit under lock and key.
[00:43:32.161 --> 00:43:33.201]  They won't let me take one.
[00:43:33.241 --> 00:43:34.221]  I haven't had a chance to read it.
[00:43:34.261 --> 00:43:38.402]  But while we've been sitting here and listening to the interview, I've been thumbing through a little bit.
[00:43:38.962 --> 00:43:44.604]  And the great thing about it, I think, is even just from the first chapter, you can tell Alex Jones wrote this.
[00:43:44.884 --> 00:43:49.989]  It's not a ghostwriter, it's not somebody else and they just put Alex Jones' name on it.
[00:43:50.250 --> 00:44:02.983]  The whole first chapter has this very long metaphor about tribesmen having arguments between Thag and Uther as they try to determine the best path forward for the tribe.
[00:44:03.063 --> 00:44:06.267]  I mean, if you read this and you know Alex Jones, it's in his voice.
[00:44:06.767 --> 00:44:11.648]  But of course it's different than what you get on InfoWars with him speaking off the cuff.
[00:44:11.708 --> 00:44:17.190]  It's been researched, it's been thought about, but it is very much in line with what you expect from Alex Jones.
[00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:19.850]  So I'm just looking forward to reading this myself.
[00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:22.131]  I know a lot of people out there are as well.
[00:44:22.191 --> 00:44:36.937]   Go to InfoWarsStore.com to get a copy or go to Amazon in the rare occasion that we actually ask you to go to Amazon because you can drive this up the charts and people go to the charts And if they're looking for a book to read, they're going to go see what's at the top of the chart, and if it strikes their interest, they'll purchase it.
[00:44:36.997 --> 00:44:41.200]  It really can spread this information in a massive way.
[00:44:42.001 --> 00:44:47.845]  And even if you don't buy the book, go to InfoWarsTore.com and get some of the supplements, get some of the survival material.
[00:44:48.186 --> 00:44:55.971]  I mean, I don't have to tell you today, Jackson, Mississippi has no more water, and they don't even have bottled water to give to their residents.
[00:44:56.912 --> 00:45:01.214]  And don't wait until something like that happens to go, gosh, I should have gotten a water filter.
[00:45:01.254 --> 00:45:03.375]  Gosh, I should have gotten storable food.
[00:45:03.475 --> 00:45:07.736]  Geez, if only I'd listened to the guides at InfoWars and actually prepared for something like this.
[00:45:08.096 --> 00:45:10.557]  Because once it happens, it's too late.
[00:45:10.637 --> 00:45:11.918]  You need water tomorrow.
[00:45:11.978 --> 00:45:12.758]  You need it today.

[00:46:46.266 --> 00:46:52.473]  25 years ago, Princess Diana's car crashed inside the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris, France.
[00:46:53.074 --> 00:46:57.579]  Her lover, Dadi Fayed, died upon impact along with the driver.
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:03.827]  And even though Diana survived, it took about 40 minutes to get her from the car to the ambulance.
[00:47:04.207 --> 00:47:11.977]  The official story was that they were trying to free her from the car, but several witnesses say that Diana was conscious and unobstructed.
[00:47:12.498 --> 00:47:20.768]  Photographs show that the back seat of the car was undamaged, and witnesses were pleading with the police to open the door and help her.
[00:47:21.389 --> 00:47:25.433]  Once in the ambulance, it took about 40 minutes for them to choose a hospital.
[00:47:25.834 --> 00:47:35.463]  And when they finally set off, the ambulance drove at a snail's pace and made several stops, taking about 40 minutes to drive less than four miles.
[00:47:36.264 --> 00:47:37.545]  Doctors were turned away.
[00:47:37.905 --> 00:47:39.627]  Witnesses were strip-searched.
[00:47:39.967 --> 00:47:41.469]  Cameras were confiscated.
[00:47:41.929 --> 00:47:43.451]  No evidence was gathered.
[00:47:43.711 --> 00:47:45.594]  No blood samples were taken.
[00:47:45.994 --> 00:47:51.200]  And by 3 a.m., the entire scene was sprayed down with high-pressure water hoses.
[00:47:51.981 --> 00:47:57.288]  Mercedes wanted to study the wreckage to see why it failed so badly, but they were denied.
[00:47:57.908 --> 00:48:04.376]  Diana's body was taken by the royal family who had her reproductive organs removed before burying her remains.
[00:48:05.157 --> 00:48:13.766]  All 17 cameras along the route of the crash were mysteriously turned off and all radio police frequencies went down.
[00:48:14.347 --> 00:48:18.011]  Witnesses were assaulted and threatened and there was no investigation.
[00:48:18.732 --> 00:48:29.679]  Not until the inquest ten years later, which is when most people learned that Diana had penned a note in 1996 saying that someone was going to kill her in a car accident.
[00:48:29.939 --> 00:48:32.161]  This note was concealed for six years.
[00:48:32.821 --> 00:48:38.204]  At the inquest, experts agreed that Diana would have survived if they had gotten her to a hospital.
[00:48:38.825 --> 00:48:42.027]  But the blame was put upon a military-style attack.
[00:48:42.647 --> 00:48:50.350]   According to witnesses, a group of motorcycles Along with a white Fiat Uno, worked in concert to crash the car.
[00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:56.431]  First, with a blinding flash of light, followed by an explosion from the front tire of the Mercedes.
[00:48:57.171 --> 00:49:12.654]  During the inquest, a former MI6 agent described being shown the very same plan in 1992 for a possible MI6 assassination of Slobodan Milosevic, and claimed it was MI6 who killed Diana.
[00:49:13.314 --> 00:49:21.842]  Because of all this, the inquest ended with the verdict of unlawful killing, blaming her death on the mysterious military hit squad.
[00:49:22.523 --> 00:49:31.652]  But the mainstream media spun the entire thing to make it sound like it was the paparazzi that caused her to crash, which is demonstrably false.
[00:49:32.032 --> 00:49:49.970]   And while there was no investigation into finding the members of this military hit squad, Three years later, the alleged driver of the white Fiat, who had ties to MI6, reportedly committed suicide after being found shot twice in the back of the head and burned inside of his car.
[00:49:50.790 --> 00:50:01.381]  During the inquest, many things were kept from the jury, such as the fact that Diana's seatbelt was found to be defective, and evidence of the car being sabotaged.
[00:50:01.841 --> 00:50:16.409]  Interestingly, these things would have brought more suspicion towards Dotty's father, Mohamed Al-Fayed, who, after turning down repeated offers from the French government to provide security, was solely responsible for Diana's security detail.
[00:50:16.889 --> 00:50:24.052]  And at the last minute, had them leave their security detail in front of the hotel as a decoy, and take a different car.
[00:50:24.493 --> 00:50:30.376]  A car that was recently stolen, broken, repaired, and never checked by security.
[00:50:31.176 --> 00:50:35.238]  Left with only one security guard, they were also assigned a new driver.
[00:50:35.799 --> 00:50:48.546]  Henri Paul, who had no chauffeur permit, was tied to foreign intelligence services, was seen on camera signaling to someone just before setting off, had received over 50,000 francs the day of the crash.
[00:50:49.186 --> 00:50:52.228]  And this was all under the watch of Mohammed Al-Fayed.
[00:50:52.848 --> 00:50:55.509]  Who was deeply connected to the intelligence community.
[00:50:55.989 --> 00:51:02.572]  He was business partners with one of Lee Harvey Oswald's handlers and represented the grandfather of Muhammad Atta.
[00:51:03.493 --> 00:51:05.754]  But none of that was mentioned during the inquest.
[00:51:06.274 --> 00:51:15.858]  Instead, with the help of pop culture agents such as Howard Stern and Piers Morgan, Muhammad Al-Fayed has provided the world with the cover story.
[00:51:15.918 --> 00:51:21.717]   Pretty shocking report there from Greg Reese. You just can't trust anything.
[00:51:21.717 --> 00:51:28.117]   The lies we've been told, the deaths, the ritualistic deaths and murders that the Illuminati and New World Order
[00:51:28.117 --> 00:51:29.718]  has gotten away with.
[00:51:29.718 --> 00:51:35.918]   It's all going to be exposed. You can find the full report at Band.Video from Greg Reese.
[00:51:35.918 --> 00:51:42.318]   Owen Schroer here. I take over the Alex Jones Show on the other side of this break.
[00:51:42.318 --> 00:51:51.317]   Well, ladies and gentlemen, there's been a major development with the FBI, the Mar-a-Lago raid,
[00:51:51.317 --> 00:51:59.317]   and just in general are just totally corrupt government officials on both sides of the aisle.
[00:51:59.503 --> 00:52:01.504]  It's on full display today.
[00:52:03.085 --> 00:52:04.206]  And so where do I begin?
[00:52:04.446 --> 00:52:27.646]   Do I start with Merrick Garland telling all federal employees not To communicate with Congress because there have been dozens of whistleblowers from the FBI, the DOJ and other outlets, other government institutions, going to Republican members of Congress as whistleblowers and saying,
[00:52:29.744 --> 00:52:35.307]  The hostile, anti-American, communist, Democrat Party has taken over these institutions.
[00:52:35.568 --> 00:52:37.028]  They're not acting in good faith.
[00:52:37.249 --> 00:52:38.329]  They're acting illegally.
[00:52:38.569 --> 00:52:39.430]  They have targets.
[00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:41.411]  They have targets on Trump's back.
[00:52:41.431 --> 00:52:43.372]  They have targets on the American people's back.
[00:52:43.612 --> 00:52:45.814]  They're not doing their job as they're supposed to.
[00:52:45.894 --> 00:52:50.877]  It's become a political wing, a militant wing, used against the Democrat Party opposition.
[00:52:52.028 --> 00:53:01.712]  And so dozens of these whistleblowers have gone to members of Congress and so Merrick Garland sends a statement out to all federal employees saying you're not allowed to talk to Congress.
[00:53:02.532 --> 00:53:02.832]  Wow!
[00:53:04.453 --> 00:53:11.275]  I mean folks, this is, you have FBI agents saying Christopher Wray needs to resign for corruption.
[00:53:12.396 --> 00:53:16.037]  The same thing is being said of Merrick Garland now today as well.
[00:53:19.463 --> 00:53:22.145]  So, I mean, they know what they're doing is illegal.
[00:53:22.346 --> 00:53:23.807]  They know what they're doing is criminal.
[00:53:24.207 --> 00:53:28.110]  Merrick Garland is a rat.
[00:53:28.331 --> 00:53:29.111]  He's a weasel.
[00:53:30.192 --> 00:53:38.799]  And he's slithering around right now because he knows people are coming forward to tell Congress about his crimes and the crimes of the FBI.
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:43.463]  And so he sends out a memo saying, Don't talk to Congress!
[00:53:43.984 --> 00:53:45.765]  You're not allowed to talk to Congress!
[00:53:46.025 --> 00:53:47.507]  You'll be punished if you do!
[00:53:52.239 --> 00:53:56.941]  Oh, just a subtle reminder that you're not allowed to blow the whistle.
[00:53:57.201 --> 00:54:01.123]  Oh, and where's the left wing that loves their whistleblower so much?
[00:54:01.423 --> 00:54:04.824]  Where are the liberals that are against big government corruption?
[00:54:04.924 --> 00:54:07.365]  Oh, they love it now because they're the ones running it.
[00:54:07.565 --> 00:54:07.925]  I see.
[00:54:08.325 --> 00:54:10.646]  So whistleblowers now, they don't want to hear from them.
[00:54:12.047 --> 00:54:19.570]  And the heads of the FBI and the DOJ saying, shut up agents, you're not allowed to talk to Congress, you're not allowed to talk to the American people, just shut up and do our bidding.
[00:54:20.518 --> 00:54:22.419]  That's all good for the New Democrat Party.
[00:54:22.479 --> 00:54:26.462]  After all, they're totalitarians, they're authoritarians, they're tyrants.
[00:54:26.682 --> 00:54:29.944]  They are out to crush this country.
[00:54:30.664 --> 00:54:33.926]  But first they must crush the opposition to the Democrat Party.
[00:54:34.987 --> 00:54:52.055]   Tom Cotton responds to this egregious offense from Merrick Garland, a threat A veiled threat to FBI agents and Department of Justice officials, a threat to them, that if they talk to Congress, he's going to target them.
[00:54:52.115 --> 00:54:53.257]  Now who knows what that means?
[00:54:54.378 --> 00:54:59.745]  Remember what Chuck Schumer said, you mess with the intelligence agencies, they have five ways from Sunday of getting back at you.
[00:55:00.025 --> 00:55:01.367]  Donald Trump has learned that, hasn't he?
[00:55:02.759 --> 00:55:03.939]  These are corrupt people.
[00:55:04.559 --> 00:55:07.140]  Our Democrat Party is beyond corrupt.
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:10.740]  It's hostile towards the American people and the American way of life.
[00:55:11.321 --> 00:55:19.642]  And now it is running the Department of Justice and running the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and now they are hostile towards the American people.
[00:55:20.042 --> 00:55:25.323]  And we know it, and the FBI whistleblowers are coming forward, so Merrick Garland says, don't do that!
[00:55:25.663 --> 00:55:27.003]  Don't tell people what we're doing!
[00:55:27.484 --> 00:55:29.444]  And if you do, we're going to come for you now!
[00:55:31.633 --> 00:55:32.574]  Unbelievable stuff.
[00:55:32.614 --> 00:55:37.237]  I mean, this is, this is, multi-fire alarm right here.
[00:55:37.497 --> 00:55:39.118]  This is, sound the alarms.
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.281]  This is code red.
[00:55:45.163 --> 00:55:55.050]  That you have whistleblowers coming forward, telling you about the corruption in our institutions, and then the leaders say, don't you dare be transparent with the American people.
[00:55:56.010 --> 00:55:59.393]  And the liberal left that apparently is all for transparency, they're all okay with all of this.
[00:55:59.713 --> 00:56:05.747]   So Tom Cotton responds, Department of Justice employees, take notice.
[00:56:06.288 --> 00:56:17.270]  No matter what this memo says, you are protected by federal law if you contact my office to blow the whistle on the improper politicization of the Department of Justice by Merrick Garland and Joe Biden.
[00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:21.511]  So again, now was it Merrick Garland?
[00:56:22.331 --> 00:56:23.991]  Was it his idea to put this memo out?
[00:56:24.051 --> 00:56:25.571]  Was it someone in the Biden White House?
[00:56:26.692 --> 00:56:27.472]  Was it Obama?
[00:56:29.372 --> 00:56:39.244]   Whose idea was it for Merrick Garland to send out a threat A threat to federal agents who are blowing the whistle on government corruption.
[00:56:39.645 --> 00:56:41.346]  Who told Merrick Garland to do that?
[00:56:41.826 --> 00:56:44.448]  Because you take one look at that sniveling rat.
[00:56:44.708 --> 00:56:45.868]  He doesn't have a spine.
[00:56:46.349 --> 00:56:48.150]  He doesn't have testicular fortitude.
[00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:49.130]  He didn't do this.
[00:56:49.331 --> 00:56:50.391]  This was not his idea.
[00:56:51.432 --> 00:56:56.115]  He's a weak, he is a weak, squishy sponge.
[00:56:57.215 --> 00:56:58.156]  He's an invertebrate.
[00:56:59.383 --> 00:57:01.585]  So who told Merrick Garland to write this?
[00:57:01.925 --> 00:57:03.907]  Who told Merrick Garland to put this letter out?
[00:57:04.387 --> 00:57:12.273]  Or maybe he really is so scared that he's going to be exposed for the criminal that he is, that maybe he did really pen this memo himself.
[00:57:12.353 --> 00:57:13.674]  Maybe it really was his idea.
[00:57:13.954 --> 00:57:14.575]  I doubt that.
[00:57:15.776 --> 00:57:26.875]   Either way, it shows you That the Biden regime and the American deep state are scared that you're going to find out what they're actually up to.
[00:57:27.355 --> 00:57:44.524]  Just like the liberals in the classrooms sexually grooming children, just like the doctors at the hospitals sexually mutilating children, just like they don't want you to know what they're doing, they try to hide what they're doing, now that's what the Department of Justice and the FBI are doing.
[00:57:44.904 --> 00:57:47.806]  Threatening agents who blow the whistle on corruption.
[00:57:50.302 --> 00:57:51.503]  Threatening agents.
[00:57:53.724 --> 00:57:58.066]  Attorney General Merrick Garland threatens DOJ employees about contacting Congress.
[00:58:00.408 --> 00:58:06.891]  Now, he's the one breaking the law, not FBI agents or Department of Justice officials going to Congress.
[00:58:06.911 --> 00:58:08.732]  That's their duty, that's their job.
[00:58:08.812 --> 00:58:10.093]  Congress is there for oversight.
[00:58:10.493 --> 00:58:11.914]  So that's the entire purpose.
[00:58:12.515 --> 00:58:16.657]  In fact, none of these institutions are supposed to be operating without Congress.
[00:58:18.643 --> 00:58:21.764]  But see, they've become their own institutions.
[00:58:21.784 --> 00:58:23.205]  They've become their own entity.
[00:58:23.645 --> 00:58:25.246]  And now they think they're bigger than Congress.
[00:58:25.286 --> 00:58:26.387]  No, Congress is over you.
[00:58:26.747 --> 00:58:28.888]  Congress can shut you down tomorrow, if it wants.
[00:58:29.388 --> 00:58:29.828]  And should.
[00:58:30.749 --> 00:58:32.309]  The FBI should be totally shut down.
[00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:33.890]  And by the way, Ted Cruz now agrees.
[00:58:35.051 --> 00:58:36.551]  The FBI needs to be shut down.
[00:58:37.912 --> 00:58:39.693]  The Department of Justice needs to be shut down.
[00:58:41.214 --> 00:58:43.395]  And the State Department needs to be shut down.
[00:58:43.575 --> 00:58:44.475]  And that'd be a good start.
[00:58:44.995 --> 00:58:49.447]   And if you want to bring them back, Maybe, but I think you just shut them down.
[00:58:49.627 --> 00:58:50.647]  They're so out of control.
[00:58:50.887 --> 00:58:52.068]  Our government's out of control.
[00:58:53.168 --> 00:58:54.409]  The government's way too big.
[00:58:54.489 --> 00:58:56.150]  It's hostile against the American people.
[00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:57.030]  I'm done with it.
[00:58:57.110 --> 00:58:58.351]  The American people are done with it.
[00:58:58.871 --> 00:59:00.351]  And they know their time is short.
[00:59:00.652 --> 00:59:05.374]  That's why they're threatening people who call out the corrupt leadership.
[00:59:06.814 --> 00:59:07.875]  Now this is how you do it.
[00:59:07.975 --> 00:59:11.396]  Because they're not going to just abolish themselves.
[00:59:12.136 --> 00:59:15.758]  And our Congress is filled with a bunch of wuss bags.
[00:59:17.202 --> 00:59:18.183]  So they're not going to do it either.
[00:59:18.723 --> 00:59:19.744]  So this is how you're going to have to do it.
[00:59:19.764 --> 00:59:20.865]  You're going to have to do it at the state level.
[00:59:21.426 --> 00:59:29.113]  Arizona Republicans censure rogue FBI days after Mar-a-Lago raid, call on state of Arizona to end cooperation with the FBI.
[00:59:29.494 --> 00:59:29.894]  Boom.
[00:59:30.254 --> 00:59:31.115]  That's how it's done.
[00:59:32.817 --> 00:59:35.099]  Texas is probably not going to take this leadership role.
[00:59:35.119 --> 00:59:36.080]  Greg Abbott is too weak.
[00:59:37.253 --> 00:59:44.380]  But I can see Florida, and if Lake becomes the governor of Arizona, I can see Lake doing this, and then maybe Texas would follow.
[00:59:44.881 --> 00:59:46.442]  Governor Abbott, he's a follower.
[00:59:47.063 --> 00:59:48.244]  He's not a leader, he's a follower.
[00:59:48.865 --> 01:00:03.025]   So if the leaders like DeSantis and Lake declare that, you know what, any federal government institution no longer has any Jurisdiction in my state.
[01:00:03.265 --> 01:00:03.605]  Sorry.
[01:00:04.126 --> 01:00:06.367]  FBI, DOJ, IRS.
[01:00:06.667 --> 01:00:06.827]  No.
[01:00:07.167 --> 01:00:07.308]  Nope.
[01:00:07.848 --> 01:00:08.128]  Sorry.
[01:00:08.288 --> 01:00:09.249]  No jurisdiction here.
[01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:10.089]  You're not allowed here.
[01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:11.030]  You don't have any rights here.
[01:00:13.311 --> 01:00:14.112]  And that's how you do it.
[01:00:16.661 --> 01:00:20.985]  Arizona Republicans call on the state of Arizona to end cooperation with the FBI.
[01:00:21.446 --> 01:00:23.087]  That's how it's done.
[01:00:23.127 --> 01:00:25.390]  You want to protect your constituents?
[01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:27.732]  You want to protect the citizens of your state?
[01:00:28.072 --> 01:00:32.436]  Protect them from this rogue, criminal, out-of-control federal government.
[01:00:34.138 --> 01:00:35.199]  That's how it needs to be done.
[01:00:37.922 --> 01:00:41.025]  There needs to be mass arrests happening.
[01:00:42.537 --> 01:00:50.001]  There need to be people being walked out in shackles for what's being done at the FBI and what's being done at the Department of Justice.
[01:00:51.962 --> 01:00:53.283]  But that might be a pipe dream.
[01:00:54.483 --> 01:01:01.727]  So our best hope is that state governments will say, FBI, IRS, DOJ, you no longer can operate here.
[01:01:02.528 --> 01:01:04.609]  But that's just the beginning of the corruption.
[01:01:04.869 --> 01:01:07.090]  Wait till you see what's next from the Mar-a-Lago raid.
[01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:10.032]  You know, I gotta tell you folks, this stuff is uh...
[01:01:11.044 --> 01:01:14.208]  It's so dangerous what's happening in this country.
[01:01:16.171 --> 01:01:18.714]  It's so dangerous how corrupt our government has become.
[01:01:18.774 --> 01:01:20.957]  And it's not just hard to believe.
[01:01:23.632 --> 01:01:28.474]  The extreme levels of corruption at the FBI, the DOJ, the IRS, and the White House.
[01:01:29.315 --> 01:01:32.196]  It's just as hard to believe that there's almost no resistance.
[01:01:32.376 --> 01:01:33.777]  Like, nobody wants to stop this?
[01:01:35.498 --> 01:01:39.720]  We have a small handful of Congress members that are willing to speak out against this corruption?
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:41.301]  Nobody in the military?
[01:01:41.321 --> 01:01:46.043]  I mean, most people in media don't even want to address it?
[01:01:46.083 --> 01:01:48.444]  There's just a small handful of people in media that want to address this?
[01:01:48.464 --> 01:01:49.825]  I mean, this is just shocking stuff.
[01:01:53.612 --> 01:01:57.033]  The Department of Justice threatening federal agents that blow the whistle on corruption?
[01:01:57.053 --> 01:01:58.393]  I mean, come on!
[01:01:59.113 --> 01:02:00.534]  Do you not see where this goes?
[01:02:01.574 --> 01:02:03.374]  Do you not see how dangerous this is?
[01:02:07.596 --> 01:02:08.456]  And here's what they do.
[01:02:10.516 --> 01:02:12.037]  They set up the false flags.
[01:02:12.417 --> 01:02:21.119]  They set up the false narratives so that they can claim to be the victim and assume more power as their hour of corruption is on full display.
[01:02:23.939 --> 01:02:27.521]  Why doesn't the DOJ want federal agents blowing the whistle?
[01:02:27.602 --> 01:02:29.163]  Because they know what they're doing is illegal.
[01:02:29.703 --> 01:02:37.808]  Why does the Boston Children's Hospital erase all the documents about the trans kids' surgeries and erase all their videos about the trans kids' surgeries?
[01:02:37.828 --> 01:02:39.269]  Because they know what they're doing is child abuse.
[01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:49.696]  They don't want you to know what they're doing, but they want to be able to do it in public so that you just assume it's okay, but then when you point it out and you say, hey, that's not okay, they say, wait a second, we're not even doing this.
[01:02:50.717 --> 01:02:51.798]  Because they know it's criminal.
[01:02:52.078 --> 01:02:57.908]   They're abusing children, And they're using the government in authoritarian, totalitarian ways.
[01:02:59.249 --> 01:03:08.556]  And we just sit here and take it because our Congress is so pathetic, our media is so pathetic, and quite frankly the average American person is so pathetic.
[01:03:11.197 --> 01:03:11.958]  Sad truths.
[01:03:13.553 --> 01:03:14.254]  Sad truths.
[01:03:14.974 --> 01:03:16.495]  So they set themselves up at the victim.
[01:03:17.215 --> 01:03:21.698]  Bomb threat at Boston Children's Hospital was false alarm, police say.
[01:03:22.139 --> 01:03:22.899]  Oh, you don't say!
[01:03:22.919 --> 01:03:24.120]  They probably bomb threat themselves.
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:29.483]  Probably one of those liberal doctors that chops little kids' weenies off and chops little girls' breasts off.
[01:03:29.804 --> 01:03:33.846]  Probably one of those doctors that called in a fake bomb threat to say, see, I'm the victim!
[01:03:34.166 --> 01:03:35.988]  Now bring in more kids for me to slaughter!
[01:03:37.669 --> 01:03:39.490]  Bring in more kids for me to chop up!
[01:03:40.643 --> 01:03:42.924]  Bring in more kids for me to slice and dice!
[01:03:43.925 --> 01:03:46.826]  I'm a liberal, and I'm here to slaughter your baby.
[01:03:48.687 --> 01:03:52.989]  And then when you call it out, they erase the documents, they erase the videos, and they say, we never did this!
[01:03:53.209 --> 01:03:56.170]  In fact, you're lying about us, and now we're getting bomb threats!
[01:03:56.991 --> 01:04:01.413]  These people are unreal in their evil.
[01:04:01.733 --> 01:04:05.995]  They're unreal in their lying, and their fraud, and their corruption.
[01:04:07.596 --> 01:04:09.737]  And their disdain towards humanity.
[01:04:10.902 --> 01:04:11.985]  FBI does the same thing.
[01:04:13.749 --> 01:04:14.631]  The Daily Beast today.
[01:04:15.012 --> 01:04:17.818]  FBI is facing unprecedented mega-threats.
[01:04:18.917 --> 01:04:24.301]  Oh, what, a bunch of federal agents go online and post anonymous accounts threatening the FBI?
[01:04:24.781 --> 01:04:35.009]  Oh, oh, like a bunch of federal agents pretend to kidnap Governor Whitmer, try to pretend to kidnap Governor Northam, go out on January 6th inciting violence, telling people to go into the Capitol?
[01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:37.471]  Unbelievable levels of corruption.
[01:04:37.711 --> 01:04:40.513]  This is the most dangerous time in this country's history.
[01:04:41.374 --> 01:04:42.635]  Perhaps even the world.
[01:04:45.623 --> 01:04:49.564]  If the American government becomes this authoritarian and this corrupt, folks, it's over.
[01:04:50.524 --> 01:04:51.104]  Forget about it.
[01:04:52.404 --> 01:04:52.885]  Forget about it.
[01:04:53.105 --> 01:04:58.906]  America is the last bastion of hope and freedom and independence and prosperity that this planet has to offer.
[01:04:59.386 --> 01:05:02.126]  And if it goes away, it's done.
[01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:04.507]  It's over.
[01:05:05.587 --> 01:05:09.668]  And that's why the globalists are so intent on destroying America right now.
[01:05:09.768 --> 01:05:13.829]  That's why you see all the operations so hardcore in America right now.
[01:05:15.888 --> 01:05:19.090]  So they false flag themselves, oh we're getting threatened!
[01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:21.011]  They threaten themselves, it's false flag.
[01:05:21.671 --> 01:05:26.234]  Whether it's the Boston Children's Hospital or whether it's the FBI, it's them doing it to themselves.
[01:05:27.074 --> 01:05:29.476]  So that they can cry victim in their time of exposure.
[01:05:30.276 --> 01:05:34.659]  And then they threaten employees who dare go public with the corruption.
[01:05:35.799 --> 01:05:39.521]  But then you've got the Mar-a-Lago raid, and everybody involved in that needs to be in jail.
[01:05:40.382 --> 01:05:42.123]  But they won't because they're Democrats.
[01:05:44.952 --> 01:05:48.994]  So, they just released a photo from inside Mar-a-Lago.
[01:05:49.114 --> 01:05:50.935]  Folks, this is so ridiculous.
[01:05:52.415 --> 01:05:55.857]  Again, it's hard to even fathom that this is the reality that we live in right now.
[01:05:55.897 --> 01:05:57.638]  It's hard to fathom how corrupt our government is.
[01:05:57.858 --> 01:06:00.959]  It's hard to fathom how big of liars our politicians are.
[01:06:01.319 --> 01:06:09.063]  So you've got Eric Swalwell, you've got Liz Cheney, you've got other members of the establishment, the corrupt American regime.
[01:06:10.609 --> 01:06:25.556]  Putting out a photo that gets leaked, how convenient, of the Mar-a-Lago raid, where it's all the top secret documents laid out on a floor at Mar-a-Lago, and then the boxes of pictures that they took.
[01:06:25.776 --> 01:06:26.436]  It's pictures.
[01:06:26.677 --> 01:06:32.579]  Donald Trump has framed magazine covers of Time Magazine and other stuff in frames that they took and they put in boxes too.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.641]  Oh my gosh, guys!
[01:06:37.239 --> 01:06:45.725]  The stuff that Donald Trump took from the White House at Mar-a-Lago is so secretive that they're publishing it on the internet!
[01:06:47.566 --> 01:06:55.091]  It's such a crime, the documents that Donald Trump has, that they're taking pictures of them for the American people to see!
[01:06:56.332 --> 01:06:58.013]  I mean, talk about a fraud!
[01:07:01.536 --> 01:07:03.977]  Talk about desperation!
[01:07:05.086 --> 01:07:06.527]  Why didn't they release this originally?
[01:07:06.787 --> 01:07:09.408]  Because they're losing now.
[01:07:09.428 --> 01:07:11.548]  They've lost the Mar-a-Lago narrative.
[01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:18.291]  So now they're putting up these secrets, these pictures of secret documents supposedly, and they're saying, look, this is what Trump had.
[01:07:18.471 --> 01:07:20.251]  Well then why are you putting pictures out of their secret?
[01:07:22.072 --> 01:07:24.913]  You redacted the whole affidavit that you said Trump was afraid for people to see.
[01:07:24.973 --> 01:07:26.013]  You were afraid for people to see it.
[01:07:26.053 --> 01:07:26.914]  You lied about that too.
[01:07:28.434 --> 01:07:39.093]   And then the nerve of Eric Swalwell, the guy caught with a Chinese spy, He says, these are the secrets that protect our troops.
[01:07:39.213 --> 01:07:39.414]  Really?
[01:07:39.434 --> 01:07:40.475]  You just published them on Twitter.
[01:07:41.216 --> 01:07:43.017]  Either you want them protected, really?
[01:07:43.038 --> 01:07:44.059]  You just published them on Twitter.
[01:07:44.459 --> 01:07:48.123]  Or believe they should be in the hands of a corrupt man who has used U.S.
[01:07:48.143 --> 01:07:49.905]  resources before to help himself.
[01:07:50.405 --> 01:07:56.171]  Eric, we're still waiting for you to produce the evidence of Russian collusion that you claimed you had multiple times.
[01:07:57.199 --> 01:08:00.440]  During congressional hearings, you claimed you had the proof of Russian collusion.
[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:01.901]  We haven't seen that yet, Eric.
[01:08:02.201 --> 01:08:03.361]  So you lied about that, too.
[01:08:03.662 --> 01:08:05.482]  You're a dirty, rotten, no-good liar.
[01:08:05.702 --> 01:08:06.463]  And everyone knows it.
[01:08:07.443 --> 01:08:09.724]  But then he just reaches for new levels of insanity.
[01:08:09.764 --> 01:08:12.205]  He says, are you with the troops or Trump?
[01:08:12.645 --> 01:08:19.568]  I'm sick and tired of liberal Democrats getting to wave the American flag like they're patriots whenever it's convenient for them.
[01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:24.450]  The American Democrat Party has destroyed our military.
[01:08:26.274 --> 01:08:29.356]  They've let out top secrets of our military.
[01:08:29.596 --> 01:08:31.557]  Hillary Clinton has released top secrets.
[01:08:33.338 --> 01:08:38.781]  They allowed top secrets to get confiscated because of the fallout after Afghanistan and the pullout.
[01:08:40.213 --> 01:08:42.194]  They're the ones that kneel for the flag.
[01:08:42.435 --> 01:08:45.077]  They're the ones that tell you how bad and racist America is.
[01:08:45.317 --> 01:08:46.598]  They're the haters of America.
[01:08:46.758 --> 01:08:48.659]  They're the ones destroying the American way of life.
[01:08:48.819 --> 01:08:51.381]  They're the ones wiping their ass with the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:08:51.621 --> 01:08:55.524]  But then, whenever it's convenient for them, they act like they're the American patriots.
[01:08:55.824 --> 01:08:57.746]  Oh, now Eric Swalwell cares about America.
[01:08:58.046 --> 01:09:00.648]  Oh, Eric Swalwell's the American patriot, not Donald Trump.
[01:09:00.988 --> 01:09:02.810]  What a BS lie!
[01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:03.990]  What is it, Democrats?
[01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:05.952]  Do you hate America, or do you love America?
[01:09:06.972 --> 01:09:07.872]  Make up your mind.
[01:09:08.112 --> 01:09:09.192]  We all know what it is.
[01:09:09.473 --> 01:09:10.673]  We all know you hate America.
[01:09:10.713 --> 01:09:11.973]  We all know you hate the American people.
[01:09:12.273 --> 01:09:16.954]  So why do you wave the American flag and claim to stand for the troops whenever it's convenient for you?
[01:09:18.754 --> 01:09:20.255]  It's obnoxious, but oh my gosh.
[01:09:21.515 --> 01:09:23.595]  The top secret Mar-a-Lago documents.
[01:09:23.895 --> 01:09:26.196]  Oh, they're so top secret that they're now sharing them.
[01:09:26.476 --> 01:09:30.277]  Eric Swalwell is now publishing pictures of them on the internet saying how top secret they are.
[01:09:30.517 --> 01:09:42.305]   But you know, it's funny because When we had Hillary Clinton's emails, and they said top secret on them, and those got leaked, and we had them, and they all said top secret and confidential and everything, they didn't care then, did they?
[01:09:43.086 --> 01:09:47.570]  They didn't care about Hillary Clinton's secret email servers that she smashed up and all the confidential stuff.
[01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:48.731]  They didn't care about that.
[01:09:49.031 --> 01:09:54.676]  So the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Democrat Party all know what they're doing, quite frankly, is treason.
[01:09:54.936 --> 01:09:55.877]  It's just all treason.
[01:09:57.051 --> 01:10:07.135]  And so they're threatening employees that blow the whistle, and they're going to the media, and they're saying, hey, don't talk about this, don't cover this, censor this, it's Russian disinformation.
[01:10:07.195 --> 01:10:07.876]  No, it's the truth.
[01:10:07.956 --> 01:10:13.218]  They just claim it's Russian disinformation because they don't want you to know the truth about the treason that they're currently involved in.
[01:10:15.259 --> 01:10:16.540]  It's just unprecedented, folks.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:26.284]  It's truly unprecedented, and it's soul-crushing that we don't have a louder, stronger, bigger resistance against this.
[01:10:27.495 --> 01:10:35.040]  And that innocent people, there's all kinds of innocent people rotting in jails right now, but I mean, let's talk about the political nature of it.
[01:10:36.861 --> 01:10:41.845]  Nonviolent, innocent people, January 6th defendants, rotting away in jail cells right now.
[01:10:42.005 --> 01:10:44.727]  Veterans, rotting away in jail cells right now.
[01:10:44.807 --> 01:11:02.186]   Grandparents, doctors, rotting away in jail cells right now because of the Democrat Party needs their political prisoners to Ammunition to their narrative that Trump supporters are the bad guys when they know they're the real terrorists.
[01:11:02.366 --> 01:11:03.326]  They're the real bad guys.
[01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:06.927]  So they have to arrest all their opposition to say, see, we told you they're the bad guys.
[01:11:08.608 --> 01:11:14.549]  Meanwhile, everything they're doing is an act of war against America, sabotaging our communications, sabotaging our energy.
[01:11:16.930 --> 01:11:20.891]  And then the real criminals in the Democrat Party and the FBI get to walk free.
[01:11:23.652 --> 01:11:24.192]  Breaks your heart.
[01:11:26.172 --> 01:11:29.033]  Break your heart, crushes your soul that this is how corrupt our country is.
[01:11:29.933 --> 01:11:33.594]  And there's barely any resistance, there's barely any noise to shut this down.
[01:11:35.534 --> 01:11:44.217]  Small handful of people in the media, small handful of people in Congress, and now the Department of Justice is threatening government officials who blow the whistle on corruption.
[01:11:44.577 --> 01:11:54.621]   Folks, these are dark times for this country, and if we don't turn it around fast, You're gonna see corruption and darkness and evil, the likes of which you never thought you would.
[01:11:55.662 --> 01:12:00.923]  And those two faces that you just had on the screen, Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, you are just as guilty as anyone else.
[01:12:01.503 --> 01:12:07.765]  Your complete abstention from any action on this is guilt.
[01:12:10.319 --> 01:12:19.804]  The fact that those two are such pieces of trash politicians that they can't call out the corruption of the FBI, the DOJ, the Democrat Party.
[01:12:19.824 --> 01:12:25.807]  Instead, they sit in silence and do nothing like wuss bags and cowards and squishies.
[01:12:27.328 --> 01:12:30.289]  Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy are an embarrassment.
[01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:35.192]  They are an embarrassment and they are a pathetic excuse for a man.
[01:12:36.661 --> 01:12:39.726]  A pathetic excuse for men, Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy.
[01:12:40.066 --> 01:12:41.429]  You two suck!
[01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:46.356]  Everybody should be emailing Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell right now.
[01:12:47.218 --> 01:12:48.359]  DO SOMETHING!
[01:12:50.595 --> 01:12:53.197]  Do something about the FBI corruption!
[01:12:53.497 --> 01:12:55.458]  Do something about the DOJ corruption!
[01:12:55.779 --> 01:12:58.361]  Do something to protect the FBI whistleblowers!
[01:12:58.701 --> 01:13:02.283]  Do something to release the political prisoners of the Democrat Party!
[01:13:02.584 --> 01:13:05.305]  Do something to address the Biden crime family!
[01:13:05.486 --> 01:13:08.748]  Because Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy have done nothing!
[01:13:08.648 --> 01:13:09.488]  Nothing!
[01:13:09.488 --> 01:13:11.328]  Nothing!
[01:13:11.328 --> 01:13:19.528]  I've got other news to cover and we got a guest coming up.
[01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:21.662]  Sarah Gonzalez from The Blaze.
[01:13:22.523 --> 01:13:25.086]  But, uh, I mean, this is everything, folks.
[01:13:27.328 --> 01:13:41.440]  And as big as all the other news on my desk is with the vaccines and the crime waves, and our military being shut down, and the sexual grooming of the children in the classrooms, and our infrastructure failing, that's all big stuff.
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:42.441]  Those are all big developments.
[01:13:42.481 --> 01:13:42.902]  But this?
[01:13:43.442 --> 01:13:46.083]  But this right here is bigger than all of it.
[01:13:46.383 --> 01:13:57.187]  The corruption at the FBI, the corruption at the DOJ, the corruption of the Democrat Party is death for freedom, death for America, and death for prosperity.
[01:13:58.008 --> 01:13:58.488]  It's all of it.
[01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:00.028]  It's all done.
[01:14:01.609 --> 01:14:04.310]  So all the other stuff is just a trickle down.
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:11.583]  All the other stuff, the infrastructure failing, the military failing, the sexual grooming of the children, the crime waves, all of it.
[01:14:11.944 --> 01:14:14.985]  That's all trickle down of this right here.
[01:14:15.385 --> 01:14:17.907]  The corruption at the government at the very top.
[01:14:18.967 --> 01:14:20.268]  That's the problem here.
[01:14:21.609 --> 01:14:25.111]  And we don't even have strong enough leadership to even address it.
[01:14:25.831 --> 01:14:26.492]  A mouse!
[01:14:27.872 --> 01:14:28.493]  A mouse!
[01:14:29.901 --> 01:14:33.283]  In a church makes more noise than Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy.
[01:14:34.183 --> 01:14:43.269]  I have baby frogs in my backyard that make more of a racket than Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy dealing with political prisoners and Democrat Party corruption.
[01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:54.275]  I'd rather have a can of spam as the leaders of the Republican Party.
[01:14:54.295 --> 01:14:57.577]  That might be a little more effective than Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy.
[01:14:58.490 --> 01:15:03.172]  A can of spam, or maybe like a tube of toothpaste or something.
[01:15:03.532 --> 01:15:05.213]  Anything, anything is about the same!
[01:15:06.673 --> 01:15:13.076]  The effectiveness of Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell is about as equal to an empty cup of coffee.
[01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:14.556]  An empty mug.
[01:15:15.477 --> 01:15:16.597]  It is just worthless.
[01:15:17.778 --> 01:15:19.518]  That's Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy.
[01:15:19.558 --> 01:15:20.879]  Completely worthless, doing nothing.
[01:15:22.822 --> 01:15:34.008]  I got all these videos, I got all these news stories, but it's like, if we don't address this, if we can't stop the most obvious political corruption that we've ever seen in the history of this country, then nothing else matters.
[01:15:34.248 --> 01:15:45.174]  They'll sexualize the kids, they'll groom the kids, they'll rape the kids in the classroom, they'll chop off their breasts, they'll chop off their weenies, they'll shut down our military, they'll shut down our infrastructure, they'll force you to get a poisonous vaccine.
[01:15:45.754 --> 01:15:47.475]  It all trickles down from this right here.
[01:15:48.447 --> 01:16:01.035]  The fact that we won't be honest about how corrupt our government is, the fact that we can't be real about how corrupt our government is, and the fact that the real criminals in this country are yet to be brought to justice, it's only going to get worse.
[01:16:02.096 --> 01:16:04.557]  It only gets worse until this is addressed right here.
[01:16:07.039 --> 01:16:20.829]   How they're able to get away with the criminal raid at Mar-a-Lago, how they're able to get away with threatening federal officials who blow the whistle on government corruption, If that is not addressed, it's over, folks.
[01:16:20.949 --> 01:16:22.670]  It's game over for you.
[01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:24.291]  It's game over for this country.
[01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:27.612]  It's just game over, man.
[01:16:30.053 --> 01:16:34.595]  And you sit there and you look at Mitch McConnell and Ken McCarthy and you just say, why are you doing this to us?
[01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:38.717]  Why are you letting us be destroyed?
[01:16:39.437 --> 01:16:41.959]  Why are you letting our country get raped and pillaged and plundered?
[01:16:42.599 --> 01:16:42.879]  Why?
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:46.841]  Are you getting paid off?
[01:16:48.041 --> 01:16:50.142]  Are you actually a Democrat posing as Republican?
[01:16:50.482 --> 01:16:51.962]  Or are you really that pathetic?
[01:16:53.162 --> 01:16:56.503]  Are you really that much of a sad excuse for a human being?
[01:16:58.224 --> 01:17:00.605]  Or maybe you guys are too busy getting monkey pox with one another.
[01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:04.626]  So I'm going to get to the other news.
[01:17:05.785 --> 01:17:06.686]  Coming up here shortly.
[01:17:06.726 --> 01:17:08.167]  But it's everything, folks.
[01:17:08.227 --> 01:17:08.707]  It's everything.
[01:17:09.147 --> 01:17:11.209]  And you know it, I know it, everybody knows it.
[01:17:11.629 --> 01:17:22.777]  Until we address the corruption at the top, highest levels of our government, the double standards, all of it, the hypocrisies, the treason, until it's addressed, nothing else will be addressed.
[01:17:22.977 --> 01:17:23.257]  Nothing.
[01:17:24.278 --> 01:17:24.518]  Nothing.
[01:17:24.858 --> 01:17:29.221]  And your country will continue to spiral out of control and into a third world country.
[01:17:30.342 --> 01:17:30.422]  So.
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:34.061]  So does anyone in Congress want to start taking this seriously?
[01:17:34.722 --> 01:17:36.843]  Do people in media want to start taking this seriously?
[01:17:36.863 --> 01:17:38.444]  Does anybody want to start taking this seriously?
[01:17:38.564 --> 01:17:44.148]  Or is it just going to be the same small handful of folks in media and government that are actually taking this seriously?
[01:17:44.568 --> 01:17:49.992]  And sadly, it's just to a point where we're just basically doing play-by-play commentary on the fall of America.
[01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:52.794]  Because nobody will take serious action.
[01:17:54.144 --> 01:17:59.609]  We get arrested, we get censored, we get shut down, we get lied about, we're political prisoners, we're politically persecuted.
[01:17:59.649 --> 01:18:07.036]  I mean, we're at the front lines and it's just like, okay, we're bleeding out, it's almost done, anybody want to come help?
[01:18:09.098 --> 01:18:13.302]  Forget about Infowars' bloody corpse bleeding out on the battlefield about to die.
[01:18:13.482 --> 01:18:14.003]  Forget about that.
[01:18:14.303 --> 01:18:15.945]  The country's about to die!
[01:18:18.703 --> 01:18:22.448]  Now we are still on air every day and of course that angers the Democrat Party.
[01:18:22.708 --> 01:18:25.832]  They throw fits of rage that they haven't shut us down yet.
[01:18:27.093 --> 01:18:28.074]  Fits of rage!
[01:18:29.531 --> 01:18:33.894]  From the globalists, that we're not off air yet, but we're still here thanks to your support at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:18:50.724 --> 01:19:00.283]   The big sale's happening right now, just a few days left, to get 50% off on DNA Force Plus and 40% off Give me back my country!
[01:19:00.303 --> 01:19:01.124]  You sick bastards!
[01:19:01.424 --> 01:19:02.405]  You communist devils!
[01:19:02.305 --> 01:19:05.305]  left on those two big sales.
[01:19:05.305 --> 01:19:11.064]   These are products that go out of stock quite frequently because they're so popular and so effective.
[01:19:11.064 --> 01:19:18.625]   So 50% off DNA Force Plus, 40% off Ultimate Fish Oil, but only five days left on that sale at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:19:18.625 --> 01:19:22.704]  Give me back my country!
[01:19:22.704 --> 01:19:24.864]  You sick bastards!
[01:19:24.864 --> 01:19:26.585]  You communist devils!
[01:19:26.585 --> 01:19:30.003]  You know, here's the basic understanding.
[01:19:30.865 --> 01:19:40.284]   I don't really like buying into the left-right paradigm, but it's obviously real, you can't deny it.
[01:19:39.449 --> 01:19:40.830]  And so let's just be honest about it.
[01:19:42.471 --> 01:19:48.116]  The left-wing ideology is all about human control.
[01:19:49.864 --> 01:19:53.806]  And it's going to take humans to control other humans.
[01:19:54.386 --> 01:19:55.607]  That's everything.
[01:19:56.167 --> 01:19:57.147]  That's the foundation.
[01:19:57.187 --> 01:20:02.570]  That's the root of everything that is the left-wing ideology, is that humans need to be in control of other humans.
[01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:06.391]  So that's why the left needs you to be their subjects.
[01:20:06.631 --> 01:20:07.832]  They can't have you free.
[01:20:08.332 --> 01:20:09.653]  They can't have you independent.
[01:20:10.213 --> 01:20:12.754]  They can't have you in charge of yourself.
[01:20:12.954 --> 01:20:14.215]  They have to be in charge of you.
[01:20:15.165 --> 01:20:17.546]  Whether it's health things, war things, it doesn't matter.
[01:20:17.686 --> 01:20:19.226]  They're in control of you.
[01:20:19.586 --> 01:20:22.307]  You, the human, can't be trusted, so they have to control you.
[01:20:23.727 --> 01:20:27.128]  The right-wing paradigm is self-government.
[01:20:27.428 --> 01:20:29.648]  You are in control of yourself.
[01:20:30.988 --> 01:20:32.529]  Live and let others live.
[01:20:35.009 --> 01:20:36.230]  That's the basis of all of it.
[01:20:36.730 --> 01:20:38.610]  Everything else is window dressing.
[01:20:39.490 --> 01:20:42.571]  Everything else is political footballs being punted back and forth.
[01:20:43.317 --> 01:20:44.397]  That's the foundation.
[01:20:44.477 --> 01:20:47.678]  That's what people need to understand, comprehend, and be honest about.
[01:20:47.998 --> 01:20:49.858]  Because the left-wing ideology will fail.
[01:20:50.618 --> 01:20:52.319]  Just like it has failed throughout human history.
[01:20:53.859 --> 01:21:01.260]  Why do communists always end up in blood-drenched civilizations?
[01:21:01.361 --> 01:21:03.041]  Because they try to control people.
[01:21:04.001 --> 01:21:04.561]  It fails.
[01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:06.041]  People don't want to be controlled.
[01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:07.562]  Their control mechanisms fail.
[01:21:08.262 --> 01:21:18.040]   And their Leadership fails, so people starve, people die, people go homeless, people lose everything, and then they get mad at the people that tried to control them and did it all.
[01:21:19.301 --> 01:21:22.725]  Look at Mao Zedong, Lenin, Stalin, it doesn't matter.
[01:21:22.985 --> 01:21:24.086]  All left-wing ideologies.
[01:21:25.287 --> 01:21:37.162]   You thought that humanity leaving The 20th century into the 21st century, you thought that's what we learned.
[01:21:37.322 --> 01:21:38.564]  I thought that's what we learned.
[01:21:38.905 --> 01:21:43.152]  Communism, socialism, the left-wing ideology fails.
[01:21:44.254 --> 01:21:47.258]  It fails and it results in death and misery.
[01:21:48.902 --> 01:21:52.303]  But apparently we didn't learn that, and so I guess we ought to learn it again, don't we?
[01:21:52.703 --> 01:21:54.224]  And this time on a global scale.
[01:21:54.524 --> 01:22:00.185]  So how many people have to die now because of the left-wing ideology trying to take over the globe?
[01:22:00.785 --> 01:22:03.146]  Well, by their own numbers, 8 billion?
[01:22:04.706 --> 01:22:09.408]  About 8-9 billion have to die so that the left-wing ideology can finally have its pipe dream?
[01:22:09.428 --> 01:22:10.768]  I mean, that's what it really comes down to.
[01:22:11.208 --> 01:22:13.769]  How do you really have your communist utopia?
[01:22:13.809 --> 01:22:15.209]  Well, you kill everyone, Sal.
[01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.850]  You have to kill everyone.
[01:22:18.834 --> 01:22:20.377]  So that's what people need to understand.
[01:22:20.778 --> 01:22:26.448]  Forget about all the other fluff and window dressing and all the other stuff that happens.
[01:22:28.482 --> 01:22:32.725]  The basis of left-wing ideology is humans have to be controlled by other humans.
[01:22:33.085 --> 01:22:36.507]  The basis of the right-wing ideology is humans are in control of themselves.
[01:22:37.167 --> 01:22:39.249]  Humans should be trusted to be in control of themselves.
[01:22:39.569 --> 01:22:42.110]  And I thought we all learned that that was the right way to do it.
[01:22:42.431 --> 01:22:51.756]  I thought that the proof that the American way of life was the most free and prosperous and the bastion of all hope and freedom on the planet was proof enough entering the 21st century that this is how it needs to be.
[01:22:52.077 --> 01:22:55.239]  Might not be perfect, but it's much better than what we left in the 20th century.
[01:22:55.479 --> 01:22:55.959]  But no.
[01:22:56.359 --> 01:22:57.180]  Here we are again.
[01:22:58.652 --> 01:22:59.553]  And so what happens?
[01:23:00.694 --> 01:23:04.376]  Well, you've got all the government corruption I just covered, but they always protect themselves.
[01:23:06.238 --> 01:23:12.583]  Highest Missouri State Court fines Kim Gardner only $750 after she admits to wrongdoing in Greitenskates.
[01:23:13.223 --> 01:23:15.525]  Records show 62 acts of misconduct.
[01:23:15.565 --> 01:23:25.681]   So you had the corrupt FBI and a Soros Circuit attorney set up a governor, Eric Greitens, set him up, frame him!
[01:23:26.241 --> 01:23:41.406]  Much like they tried to frame those individuals for kidnapping Governor Whitmer, much like they tried to frame people for kidnapping Northam, much like they framed people on January 6th, feds framing people, they got caught doing it to Eric Greitens, and they, and all you have is a $750 fine.
[01:23:44.067 --> 01:23:44.988]  Those are communists.
[01:23:45.548 --> 01:23:46.408]  Those are dirtbags.
[01:23:47.008 --> 01:23:48.329]  Those are corrupt government officials.
[01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:54.360]  And of course, your infrastructure is going to fail.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:59.661]  Globalist wiping out small business owners through high energy costs.
[01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:00.581]  Bingo!
[01:24:01.281 --> 01:24:02.582]  That's what it's really all about.
[01:24:02.802 --> 01:24:05.482]  That's what the man-made climate change narrative is really all about.
[01:24:05.883 --> 01:24:07.543]  Pricing you out of energy.
[01:24:08.223 --> 01:24:09.383]  That's what it's really all about.
[01:24:09.423 --> 01:24:12.724]  The elites are the only ones that should be allowed to have energy, not you.
[01:24:13.304 --> 01:24:22.607]  So you're going to be priced out of energy and it's all in the false narrative name of man-made climate change that doesn't even exist, at least nowhere near the scale they're claiming.
[01:24:24.295 --> 01:24:27.698]  So they're going to shut you down and they're going to make your infrastructure fail.
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:36.487]  California asks residents to avoid charging electric vehicles due to blackout risk days after unveiling new gas car ban.
[01:24:36.587 --> 01:24:37.288]  Isn't that funny?
[01:24:37.548 --> 01:24:38.709]  We're banning gas cars!
[01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:42.673]  But by the way, don't charge your electric vehicle because we don't have the energy capacity.
[01:24:45.036 --> 01:24:46.998]  And now they've put out this heat bulletin.
[01:24:48.624 --> 01:24:51.546]  Excessive heat starting tomorrow will stress energy grid.
[01:24:51.606 --> 01:24:55.189]  Consumer conservation likely needed this weekend to avert power outages.
[01:24:55.469 --> 01:24:56.650]  So they're going to shut your power off.
[01:24:56.851 --> 01:24:57.971]  It has nothing to do with the heat.
[01:24:58.332 --> 01:24:59.032]  I went and I looked.
[01:24:59.373 --> 01:25:02.335]  They're expecting 96 degrees in California tomorrow.
[01:25:02.795 --> 01:25:09.661]  Folks, the entire months of June and July in Austin, Texas were about 100 degrees on average.
[01:25:12.335 --> 01:25:15.356]  Without any relief from the sun.
[01:25:16.217 --> 01:25:22.980]  I mean, we had about 60 straight days of 100 degrees and clear skies with the sun beating down on us.
[01:25:26.401 --> 01:25:27.802]  And our energy grid didn't fail.
[01:25:28.922 --> 01:25:30.223]  We didn't have to shut off the energy.
[01:25:30.263 --> 01:25:31.383]  Now, warnings were put out.
[01:25:31.443 --> 01:25:32.544]  There were requests made.
[01:25:33.763 --> 01:25:36.645]  There may have been some compliance, but it wasn't a big thing.
[01:25:36.705 --> 01:25:37.906]  It wasn't a huge problem.
[01:25:38.286 --> 01:25:40.888]  There wasn't massive energy grid shutdowns.
[01:25:41.809 --> 01:25:46.833]  So why is 96 degrees in California going to force them to shut the grid down?
[01:25:46.953 --> 01:25:47.393]  It's not.
[01:25:47.493 --> 01:25:48.154]  It's a lie.
[01:25:49.455 --> 01:25:50.776]  These are what communists do.
[01:25:51.196 --> 01:25:52.357]  It's false scarcity.
[01:25:52.877 --> 01:25:53.738]  It's control.
[01:25:55.119 --> 01:26:08.514]   This is like when Garcetti The mayor of Los Angeles, I think it was last year or maybe it was two years ago, where he put out a tweet saying, it's three o'clock, it's time to turn your AC off, it's time to shut all your electricity off, we're conserving energy.
[01:26:10.536 --> 01:26:16.260]  Now look, I'm okay with the notion that we could be better stewards to this planet.
[01:26:16.801 --> 01:26:21.484]  I'm okay with ideas that suggest, hey, maybe we could be more energy conscious.
[01:26:21.785 --> 01:26:23.446]  I'm okay with that, I think that's fine.
[01:26:24.738 --> 01:26:25.519]  Here's the problem.
[01:26:25.879 --> 01:26:27.680]  You can't force people to do it.
[01:26:29.702 --> 01:26:36.727]  And when the people promoting that are the biggest liars and conmen and thieves in this country's history, well, we're not going to listen to you.
[01:26:38.328 --> 01:26:43.272]  If we had noble leaders that actually practiced what they preached, say, hey, you know what?
[01:26:44.292 --> 01:26:50.557]  We might be able to save energy and consume less energy, and that might be better for our civilization and the planet long term.
[01:26:51.178 --> 01:26:52.479]  Here's some of the things we could do.
[01:26:52.899 --> 01:26:54.160]  Maybe you can consider doing that.
[01:26:55.455 --> 01:26:59.718]  And then, okay, well, maybe you do, maybe it works, maybe it doesn't, maybe you save on some energy bills.
[01:27:00.399 --> 01:27:20.774]  But when it's the biggest liars, thieves, and conmen that this country and this planet has ever seen, telling you that you can't use energy while they fly around the planet on private jets, and they circumnavigate the planet on their gigantic yachts, and they've got ten mansions around the planet that all have their thermostats at 69 degrees, then of course we're not going to listen.
[01:27:20.794 --> 01:27:22.256]  Of course not.
[01:27:23.274 --> 01:27:23.816]  You're liars!
[01:27:23.836 --> 01:27:25.442]  You don't practice what you preach!
[01:27:26.586 --> 01:27:29.196]  So that's why they have to force you to do it.
[01:27:30.652 --> 01:27:38.015]  A water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi has left residents with no running water, a hospital without air conditioning, and moved schools online.
[01:27:38.415 --> 01:27:41.917]  Jackson likely to go without reliable drinking water indefinitely.
[01:27:42.357 --> 01:27:43.518]  And so what are they saying though?
[01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:46.059]  They're blaming it on white people!
[01:27:46.799 --> 01:27:52.982]  They're saying, oh it's white, it's white people, it's white racism, the whites did this.
[01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:55.163]  75% of Jackson, Mississippi is black.
[01:27:58.243 --> 01:28:03.005]  So, okay, there's your race argument down the drain, but it has nothing to do with race.
[01:28:04.326 --> 01:28:14.691]  In fact, if you really want to know what's about to hit this country, the infrastructure is about to fail in ways you can't even imagine, folks, like what's happening in our military.
[01:28:15.592 --> 01:28:15.852]  U.S.
[01:28:15.932 --> 01:28:23.596]  Army grounds entire fleet of Chinook helicopters because they're malfunctioning and not working, and there have been engine fires.
[01:28:24.949 --> 01:28:30.694]  Ten Navy helicopters suffer major damage, several blown out in sudden storm.
[01:28:30.794 --> 01:28:33.376]  So I mean, it's just... So, but here's what's going on.
[01:28:34.557 --> 01:28:42.019]  Colleges are now saying that quote-unquote minorities don't have to pass MCATs or SATs or ACTs to get into colleges.
[01:28:42.359 --> 01:28:50.161]  You've got all this affirmative action, so you could have a straight A student get rejected from a college, but a student that has straight Cs that's a minority will get accepted.
[01:28:50.562 --> 01:28:54.423]  And then in the affirmative action in the workplace, they get hired for a job that they're not qualified for.
[01:28:54.703 --> 01:29:03.330]   So what do you think is going to happen when you have a bunch of unqualified People in positions that they shouldn't be in.
[01:29:03.650 --> 01:29:09.233]  Your infrastructure is going to collapse, your military is going to collapse, and your civilization is going to collapse.
[01:29:10.433 --> 01:29:11.914]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[01:29:13.454 --> 01:29:15.115]  Oh, but it's affirmative action!
[01:29:15.475 --> 01:29:16.836]  We're helping minorities!
[01:29:17.176 --> 01:29:24.259]  No, you're crushing civilization with false promotion.
[01:29:25.783 --> 01:29:29.566]  Oh, you're not smart enough for this job, but your skin color is right, so we put you in charge.
[01:29:29.646 --> 01:29:30.947]  Oop, the whole plant failed!
[01:29:31.888 --> 01:29:38.293]  So, Justin Trudeau is admitting that politicians are more hated than ever.
[01:29:40.255 --> 01:29:41.376]  And of course, we all know why.
[01:29:41.416 --> 01:29:48.742]  That's because our politicians are more corrupt and two-faced and have never had such disdain for the people.
[01:29:50.851 --> 01:29:52.851]  than they're displaying now.
[01:29:52.851 --> 01:29:56.150]  But Trudeau won't admit that. No.
[01:29:56.150 --> 01:30:00.751]   What does Trudeau blame all the resentment towards politicians on now?
[01:30:00.751 --> 01:30:04.851]  Climate change? That's right. Here he is in clip seven.
[01:30:04.851 --> 01:30:11.152]   I'm just wondering, what do you think is behind the rise in threats that politicians are facing?
[01:30:11.152 --> 01:30:14.152]  [Sigh]
[01:30:14.152 --> 01:30:17.152]  [Sigh]
[01:30:17.152 --> 01:30:18.152]  We've been through a lot.
[01:30:18.353 --> 01:30:19.274]  Because he's corrupt.
[01:30:19.794 --> 01:30:22.975]  As a country, as a world, over these past years, obviously the pandemic.
[01:30:23.275 --> 01:30:23.996]  You lied about that.
[01:30:24.036 --> 01:30:26.397]  Increasing anxiety because of climate change.
[01:30:26.417 --> 01:30:27.137]  You lied about that too.
[01:30:27.177 --> 01:30:28.657]  Transformations of our economy.
[01:30:28.837 --> 01:30:29.518]  You lied about that.
[01:30:29.898 --> 01:30:39.702]  Rise in mental health and addiction problems, particularly with the opioid crisis that has been ravaging communities right across the country.
[01:30:39.722 --> 01:30:41.102]  You caused that by colluding with Big Pharma.
[01:30:41.722 --> 01:30:43.783]  It's a lot of pressure on a lot of people.
[01:30:43.943 --> 01:30:44.643]  Because of you.
[01:30:47.441 --> 01:30:48.241]  So we resent you for it.
[01:30:50.203 --> 01:30:51.503]  There are no easy solutions.
[01:30:51.723 --> 01:30:52.164]  Yeah, you.
[01:30:52.184 --> 01:30:52.304]  Leave.
[01:30:52.324 --> 01:30:53.845]  For all these challenges we're facing.
[01:30:53.985 --> 01:30:54.765]  Yeah, there is an easy one.
[01:30:54.805 --> 01:30:54.965]  You.
[01:30:55.005 --> 01:30:55.145]  Get out.
[01:30:55.165 --> 01:30:56.106]  It's going to take hard work.
[01:30:56.126 --> 01:30:56.866]  It's going to take people.
[01:30:56.886 --> 01:30:57.186]  Not really.
[01:30:57.206 --> 01:30:57.627]  You should leave.
[01:30:57.647 --> 01:30:58.327]  Listening to each other.
[01:30:58.347 --> 01:31:00.788]  It's going to take orders of government stepping up.
[01:31:00.989 --> 01:31:01.829]  Oh, more government.
[01:31:02.089 --> 01:31:02.670]  Oh, I love that.
[01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:03.630]  Pause that one.
[01:31:04.290 --> 01:31:05.671]  Oh, we need more government.
[01:31:06.772 --> 01:31:08.853]  Justin Trudeau, there's never been more disdain for the government.
[01:31:08.873 --> 01:31:09.553]  What do you think the answer is?
[01:31:09.593 --> 01:31:10.414]  We need more government.
[01:31:12.150 --> 01:31:13.851]  And everything he just said is the very reasons.
[01:31:14.091 --> 01:31:15.252]  They lied about COVID.
[01:31:15.312 --> 01:31:16.652]  They lied about climate change.
[01:31:16.993 --> 01:31:20.995]  They gave big pharmaceutical more power than they've ever had.
[01:31:22.215 --> 01:31:23.196]  They did all of that.
[01:31:23.536 --> 01:31:24.817]  They lied to us about all of it.
[01:31:25.397 --> 01:31:26.217]  And we know it now.
[01:31:26.698 --> 01:31:27.758]  And we don't like you for it.
[01:31:28.959 --> 01:31:29.819]  But what is his solution?
[01:31:29.859 --> 01:31:31.760]  Well, you need to give me more power.
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:33.941]  No, you just need to get the hell out.
[01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:35.302]  You just need to leave us alone.
[01:31:35.342 --> 01:31:38.924]  You just need to go disappear, crawl into a hole, and everything will be just fine.
[01:31:40.009 --> 01:31:41.010]  I mean, it's no secret, folks.
[01:31:41.651 --> 01:31:44.654]  The quickest solution to saving America is getting rid of the Democrat Party.
[01:31:44.814 --> 01:31:46.495]  Removing all Democrats from positions of power.
[01:31:46.656 --> 01:31:48.898]  This country will surge overnight.
[01:31:48.918 --> 01:31:54.203]  Now, you're going to have to deal with the cowardly Republicans, too, but they're not the ones sabotaging the country.
[01:31:54.503 --> 01:31:55.624]  They're just a bunch of wussbags.
[01:31:56.405 --> 01:31:58.067]  But let's continue here with Trudell.
[01:31:58.843 --> 01:31:59.824]  No, we don't want government!
[01:31:59.844 --> 01:32:01.124]  We're sick of government!
[01:32:00.963 --> 01:32:06.564]   to each other can take orders of government stepping up and delivering for people.
[01:32:06.564 --> 01:32:07.762]  And it's a time for responsible leaders.
[01:32:07.762 --> 01:32:08.762]  No, we don't want government.
[01:32:08.762 --> 01:32:09.764]  We're sick of government.
[01:32:09.764 --> 01:32:15.844]   It's time for people to look to assuage fears and angers, to respond with a positive vision
[01:32:15.844 --> 01:32:16.844]  of the future.
[01:32:16.844 --> 01:32:19.083]  No, you use fear and anger to control people.
[01:32:19.231 --> 01:32:19.871]  Because of you!
[01:32:20.171 --> 01:32:20.631]  Because of you!
[01:32:20.671 --> 01:32:22.912]  People are hurting because of you!
[01:32:22.932 --> 01:32:23.632]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:32:23.652 --> 01:32:24.893]  Is that Fidel Castro's son?
[01:32:24.712 --> 01:32:29.591]   people are hurting because of you. A country and not just political leaders
[01:32:29.591 --> 01:32:35.752]   but community leaders, institutions are focused on supporting each other.
[01:32:35.752 --> 01:32:42.872]  Alright, that's enough. Is that Fidel Castro's son?
[01:32:42.872 --> 01:32:51.512]   Fidel Castro's other son Ted Cruz, he's actually getting it right.
[01:32:51.013 --> 01:32:54.496]  He is actually understanding that the government is the problem and we need less of it.
[01:32:55.037 --> 01:32:58.240]  So here's Ted Cruz in a candid moment.
[01:32:58.991 --> 01:33:02.293]  Discussing corruption and the solution with the FBI in clip 14.
[01:33:02.373 --> 01:33:08.517]  I wanted to say thank you so much for all you're doing to fight for Ursula Walker and to take back the Senate.
[01:33:08.537 --> 01:33:13.440]  I just think it's so important that you guys actually do defund all those IRS agents.
[01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:13.921]  Absolutely.
[01:33:13.961 --> 01:33:18.824]  But I think it's imperative that you really have to defund the FBI after all the witch hunts they're going on.
[01:33:18.944 --> 01:33:21.986]  It is horrific, the abuse of power of the FBI, and it's wrong.
[01:33:22.546 --> 01:33:26.148]  And there needs to be a complete house cleaning that happens at the FBI.
[01:33:26.208 --> 01:33:28.729]  Are you all going to be able to do that when you rethink the Senate?
[01:33:28.850 --> 01:33:30.630]  I think we need to fight to do that.
[01:33:30.671 --> 01:33:32.492]  We need to fight to have real oversight.
[01:33:32.532 --> 01:33:32.872]  Great.
[01:33:32.892 --> 01:33:34.453]  Thank you so much.
[01:33:36.158 --> 01:33:39.819]  Now I think that that's a undercover left-winger that goes in there.
[01:33:40.159 --> 01:33:41.459]  This group called the Undercurrent.
[01:33:41.479 --> 01:33:50.521]  They try to be like Project Veritas for liberals, but they can't because Republicans aren't conmen and liars that cheat, lie, and steal, and then you can catch them admitting it behind the scenes.
[01:33:50.581 --> 01:33:52.741]  They're just mostly upright, upstanding people.
[01:33:52.841 --> 01:33:56.182]  Pussies maybe, but they're actually better people than Democrats.
[01:33:56.442 --> 01:33:59.263]  Project Veritas exists because Democrats and liberals are liars and conmen.
[01:34:00.143 --> 01:34:01.625]  So you catch him behind the scenes admitting the truth.
[01:34:02.105 --> 01:34:04.888]  But, uh, the Undercurrent thinks that that hurts Ted Cruz?
[01:34:05.408 --> 01:34:07.871]  Ted Cruz calling for the abolishment of the FBI?
[01:34:08.391 --> 01:34:08.912]  Yeah!
[01:34:09.813 --> 01:34:11.795]  I celebrate that from Ted Cruz!
[01:34:12.095 --> 01:34:15.258]  Thank you, Undercurrent, for getting Ted Cruz to admit that!
[01:34:15.338 --> 01:34:31.097]  Thank you very much.
[01:34:31.158 --> 01:34:34.983]  That's why I said, yeah, go to Infoworkstore.com, get the book, it starts shipping in a couple weeks.
[01:34:35.083 --> 01:34:40.471]  The Great Reset and the War for the World, but I said go to Amazon, because it's the number one book chart in the world.
[01:34:40.851 --> 01:34:44.512]  And if it goes to number one, not of political, not of history, not of U.S.
[01:34:44.532 --> 01:34:48.653]  history, it's already number one over 40 categories, like political science, you name it.
[01:34:48.673 --> 01:34:50.313]  40 plus categories is number one.
[01:34:50.573 --> 01:34:58.495]  Ladies and gentlemen, drumroll please, of books in the world, The Great Reset and the War for the World is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[01:34:59.115 --> 01:35:01.316]  We are now number nine in the world.
[01:35:01.136 --> 01:35:06.775]  We are now number 9 in the world.
[01:35:06.775 --> 01:35:08.216]  This is major.
[01:35:08.099 --> 01:35:09.359]  This is political.
[01:35:09.359 --> 01:35:10.819]  This could fund our war chest.
[01:35:10.819 --> 01:35:14.059]  Just go to Amazon.com, everybody, and buy 10 copies.
[01:35:14.059 --> 01:35:18.958]   Send this blueprint to the Death Star and the New World Order, 'cause you read this,
[01:35:18.958 --> 01:35:20.378]  you know their whole plan, how to stop 'em.
[01:35:20.378 --> 01:35:22.198]  Hit the Great Reset, the War for the World now.
[01:35:22.198 --> 01:35:23.378]  It's gonna go to number one.
[01:35:23.378 --> 01:35:25.458]  What do you make of that?
[01:35:25.458 --> 01:35:29.759]  I've got a whole stack of news here.
[01:35:29.759 --> 01:35:36.998]   Not only do we have radical liberals sexually grooming children in the classrooms.
[01:35:37.442 --> 01:35:48.871]  We now have multiple stories where they're actually engaging in sexual acts with the students, and then the liberals on the school board cover it up, and then later they get hired to work on Democrat Party campaigns.
[01:35:49.211 --> 01:35:49.731]  Who knows?
[01:35:50.752 --> 01:35:56.216]  You protect a pedophile, you might be the next Supreme Court justice, as long as you're a good liberal Democrat.
[01:35:56.717 --> 01:36:02.981]   And so Sarah Gonzalez From the Blaze has been covering this a lot, specifically what's going on in Texas.
[01:36:03.141 --> 01:36:05.387]  Now Sarah, I find this hilarious here.
[01:36:06.408 --> 01:36:08.968]  As if this is somehow, there needs to be a debate about this.
[01:36:09.489 --> 01:36:12.429]  Franklin High School Teacher's Lesson stirs up debate.
[01:36:12.809 --> 01:36:13.609]  A debate about what?
[01:36:14.069 --> 01:36:19.550]  Texas high school teacher tells students not to judge pedophiles who sexually abuse five-year-olds.
[01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:24.291]  Franklin High School Teacher's Lesson on sex with five-year-old viral video sparks row.
[01:36:24.611 --> 01:36:26.551]  So apparently we're supposed to debate this?
[01:36:27.132 --> 01:36:33.673]  We're supposed to debate whether teachers sexually grooming and raping children is a good thing.
[01:36:33.893 --> 01:36:35.613]  Apparently this is a debate, Sarah.
[01:36:37.150 --> 01:36:41.554]  Yeah, it's really sad to see, Owen, how far we've come in this matter.
[01:36:41.694 --> 01:36:53.543]  I mean, you know, there were a lot of people, whenever we talked about the gay marriage issue, who said this is a slippery slope, and before you know it, they're going to be trying to, you know, make us empathetic towards pedophiles.
[01:36:53.663 --> 01:36:57.386]  And here we are, and we're having this conversation about whether or not we should sexualize children.
[01:36:57.407 --> 01:37:03.972]  We're having this conversation about whether or not children can consent to not only sexual acts, but also mutilating their own genitals.
[01:37:04.352 --> 01:37:13.898]  And we're having a conversation about changing the terminology of pedophiles to calling them minor attracted persons, again, to create that empathy.
[01:37:13.918 --> 01:37:16.940]  You have empathy for this person because, I mean, they can't help it.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:18.621]  Oh, and they can't help themselves.
[01:37:18.781 --> 01:37:20.302]  They are attracted to minors.
[01:37:20.362 --> 01:37:21.923]  It is something that they cannot control.
[01:37:22.343 --> 01:37:24.804]  And what happens next, they also cannot control.
[01:37:24.864 --> 01:37:26.365]  So, you know, it's really sad to see.
[01:37:26.405 --> 01:37:35.089]   I think there are a lot of people who should feel very vindicated Uh, for whatever it's worth, which is not much, but feel very vindicated and knowing that they were correct when they said, this is a slippery slope.
[01:37:35.389 --> 01:37:36.429]  This is where it's going to lead.
[01:37:36.770 --> 01:37:37.330]  And here we are.
[01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:40.091]  And it's really sad, especially for people like me who have children.
[01:37:40.111 --> 01:37:54.897]   I mean, we are raising the next generation and the amount of shielding that we're having to do for our children to make sure that they are not affected by all of these radical, you know, pedophiles and these, these radical perverted, uh, people is just, It's really, really sad.
[01:37:54.917 --> 01:38:04.329]  I went undercover to a drag show here in Texas over the weekend, and here's the footage.
[01:38:04.369 --> 01:38:05.090]  You're showing it now.
[01:38:05.210 --> 01:38:08.053]  It was really, really perverse what we saw.
[01:38:08.774 --> 01:38:16.162]   Children tipping, Drag queens, often force-fed dollars by their mothers so that they could tip these drag queens.
[01:38:16.443 --> 01:38:17.704]  Drag queens on tables.
[01:38:18.065 --> 01:38:29.117]  So we're talking about a grown man in a skirt, a very short skirt, standing on a table where there was a young girl just underneath who was able to look up the skirt.
[01:38:29.757 --> 01:38:49.853]  So, it's just, it's really scary what's happening, especially in Texas, and I think there are a lot of people who have taken for granted that Texas would just always be conservative and red, and that's just where you could go, and didn't pay any attention to all of these left-leaning, radical Democrats from California and other places who were moving here.
[01:38:50.393 --> 01:38:52.415]  And here we are, and I witnessed it with my own eyes.
[01:38:52.975 --> 01:38:53.816]  It was disgusting.
[01:38:53.996 --> 01:38:54.756]  It was perverted.
[01:38:54.777 --> 01:39:00.821]  There are so many aspects, Owen, that I could get into with you about this, quote, family-friendly drag show.
[01:39:01.842 --> 01:39:08.167]  But I think that it's really sad that there are any parents in this society who are willing to put this on their children.
[01:39:08.187 --> 01:39:10.489]  Well, and just to add some...
[01:39:11.627 --> 01:39:12.528]  Evidence to what you're talking about.
[01:39:12.548 --> 01:39:19.735]  There was a couple that moved to Austin, Texas from California, obviously because they wanted to escape the hellhole that Democrats made in California.
[01:39:20.135 --> 01:39:23.839]  And then they gave $5 million, I think that was the number, to Beto O'Rourke's campaign.
[01:39:24.519 --> 01:39:26.081]  Because they didn't get it yet.
[01:39:26.241 --> 01:39:28.643]  Because they're not bright people, obviously, they're Democrats.
[01:39:28.683 --> 01:39:39.411]   But I want to get back into the issue where they want to change the terminology and call them maps, but you just talked about You know, people are saying it's time for the mama bears to step up, and I'm seeing the mama bears step up.
[01:39:39.451 --> 01:39:42.112]  I think we are seeing a lot of action being taken.
[01:39:42.932 --> 01:39:59.918]  It's sad that it's women that have to take this leadership role, because let's say you take your kids to the park, and they're playing around in the park, and some dude shows up in a tutu and a wig with fake breasts, and starts dancing and gyrating for children on the pool.
[01:40:01.099 --> 01:40:10.366]   I mean, I'm not asking, I'm not demanding people be violent, but I mean, let's be clear, I think a father might be inclined to give that guy a knuckle sandwich and put his head in the dirt.
[01:40:12.856 --> 01:40:15.438]  Yeah, you know, there are two aspects at play here.
[01:40:15.478 --> 01:40:18.519]  You mentioned the mothers who, there are mama bears who are standing up.
[01:40:18.539 --> 01:40:21.401]  There are also, unfortunately, at that pact.
[01:40:21.481 --> 01:40:22.782]  I mean, pact, Owen.
[01:40:23.482 --> 01:40:24.843]  You can see it right here in the video.
[01:40:25.063 --> 01:40:25.583]  It was pact.
[01:40:25.663 --> 01:40:27.965]  It was so pact that they were over fire code.
[01:40:28.025 --> 01:40:31.347]  They admitted to me personally that they were violating fire code.
[01:40:31.607 --> 01:40:33.408]  Now, we called the cops, but did the cops do anything?
[01:40:33.548 --> 01:40:34.589]  No, of course not.
[01:40:34.869 --> 01:40:37.230]  So this was an event that was pact.
[01:40:37.290 --> 01:40:38.391]  There was overflow.
[01:40:38.991 --> 01:40:49.799]   And obviously, a lot of mama bears consenting to it, but The amount of fathers that were in attendance at this event was the most appalling thing to me about the event.
[01:40:50.060 --> 01:41:01.149]  All of the children that I saw that were tipping, that were taking pictures, that were clapping along, all had fathers standing there going along with it, clapping along with them.
[01:41:01.209 --> 01:41:12.019]   There's one right there, a father taking the picture with his two young daughters and his wife With these grown men dressed as women trying to sexualize his children.
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:18.947]  I don't know if it's all the soy in the food, but I don't know what the hell has happened with American men and how they are standing by.
[01:41:19.087 --> 01:41:21.650]  I get it that white liberal women are mentally ill.
[01:41:22.071 --> 01:41:22.571]  I get that.
[01:41:22.932 --> 01:41:24.674]  But what about the dads?
[01:41:24.774 --> 01:41:26.496]  Why are the dads not stepping up?
[01:41:26.576 --> 01:41:27.497]  Are they so whipped?
[01:41:27.637 --> 01:41:32.276]   and brainwashed by their wives that they just can't stand to step up.
[01:41:32.276 --> 01:41:33.516]  I don't know what it is.
[01:41:33.516 --> 01:41:37.076]  Maybe you can shed some light on it, but it has to change.
[01:41:37.076 --> 01:41:38.437]  The dads have to be stepping up.
[01:41:38.437 --> 01:41:44.717]   I said, I don't understand with what I was witnessing, how there was not a group of dads
[01:41:44.717 --> 01:41:47.917]   in the community who said, "Hell no, we're not going to let this happen.
[01:41:47.917 --> 01:41:51.117]   We're going to go in and we're going to disrupt the event and we're going to shut this thing
[01:41:51.117 --> 01:41:52.117]  down."
[01:41:52.117 --> 01:41:55.676]   Obviously not with violence or anything like that, but you go in and you let your voices
[01:41:55.676 --> 01:41:56.676]  be heard.
[01:41:56.676 --> 01:41:59.756]  That didn't happen.
[01:41:59.756 --> 01:42:04.437]   It's appalling to me that it has to be the group of moms that are standing up, that are
[01:42:04.437 --> 01:42:05.877]  protesting across the street.
[01:42:06.282 --> 01:42:08.223]  Where in the hell are the fathers?
[01:42:08.983 --> 01:42:13.045]  Well, it's a shame that you're asking me for clarification on that issue, because that's what I was going to ask you next.
[01:42:13.125 --> 01:42:14.326]  It doesn't make any sense to me!
[01:42:14.726 --> 01:42:15.987]  It doesn't make any sense to me!
[01:42:16.946 --> 01:42:22.507]  I mean, maybe, I mean, the one thing you hinted at, and maybe that's it, are they just, are they just so whipped by their wives?
[01:42:22.547 --> 01:42:24.368]  Are they just so controlled by their wives?
[01:42:24.388 --> 01:42:25.368]  Are they just so cucked?
[01:42:25.768 --> 01:42:27.808]  Are, I mean, are they filled with the soy?
[01:42:27.828 --> 01:42:29.369]  I mean, I can't figure it any other way.
[01:42:29.409 --> 01:42:30.349]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:42:30.369 --> 01:42:45.792]  I mean, I guess it might be, it might be one thing if, like, the mom took her daughter to one of these things, maybe, but it's like, oh, it's a family event, and let's, I want my son to look at a dude dressed like a woman flashing, flashing his trouser snake in front of little girls.
[01:42:47.205 --> 01:42:57.534]  Yeah, I mean, I do think there is something to be said for, you know, radical feminism and the fact that we have emasculated our men and made our women more masculine.
[01:42:57.914 --> 01:43:01.177]  So the women are likely, you know, running the show.
[01:43:01.557 --> 01:43:09.964]  The women are the masculine figures and the men are very emasculated all the time by their wives and therefore just kind of go along to get along with the wives.
[01:43:10.004 --> 01:43:12.046]  But you have to think.
[01:43:12.506 --> 01:43:23.089]  That there would be a certain point in their brain where they would click and their defense mechanism would come up and their protection mechanism would come up and they would say, I can't let you do this to my child anymore.
[01:43:23.129 --> 01:43:30.851]  Because used to, especially at the drag show over in Dallas at the gay bars, we would at least see that it was just single moms.
[01:43:30.911 --> 01:43:37.553]  It just appeared to be these moms that were doing this to their young boys because they had a vendetta against their ex-husband and wanted to trans their kids.
[01:43:39.574 --> 01:43:40.855]  Well, now that's not what we're seeing.
[01:43:40.895 --> 01:43:42.396]  We're seeing these dads go along with it.
[01:43:42.436 --> 01:43:54.422]  And I can't help but think that it must just be these emasculated, feminized men that we're confusing to make them think that their masculine is toxic and they shouldn't have it on display anymore.
[01:43:55.396 --> 01:44:13.707]  And here we are, and the dads are just allowing this, they're subjecting their children to it, and they're going along with these monstrosities that's going to affect their children for a very, very, very long time, you know, if their children survive this, because of course a lot of times they change them into trans and then they end up harming themselves.
[01:44:14.645 --> 01:44:20.228]  And maybe, too, as I was just looking at some of this footage, it looks like some of these fathers are really enjoying the show.
[01:44:20.888 --> 01:44:22.249]  One guy was trying to get the upskirt.
[01:44:22.269 --> 01:44:25.811]  He really had a nice smile on his face, kind of like Joe Biden in a child classroom.
[01:44:26.171 --> 01:44:35.916]  So maybe there's an element here that they're just not getting any gratification from their wives, and they think this is like the only hope I have of, I guess, maybe getting some skin time?
[01:44:35.976 --> 01:44:36.757]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:44:37.397 --> 01:44:38.478]  But there's no doubt.
[01:44:39.098 --> 01:44:42.380]  Here's one aspect of it, and we'll talk on this after the break.
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:47.141]  The one aspect that I think is obvious is that they just want to rub our face in it.
[01:44:47.561 --> 01:44:53.522]  Half of the motivation of this is just to rub it in our face, own conservatives, own Christians, own Americans.
[01:44:53.962 --> 01:45:03.803]  That's why when there's street preachers out at these gay pride events, these gay men go and gyrate and strip and make out and rub their genitals on the street preacher just to rub it in his face.
[01:45:04.844 --> 01:45:06.184]  Sarah Gonzalez is our guest.
[01:45:06.204 --> 01:45:08.404]  She's a host at Blaze TV.
[01:45:09.144 --> 01:45:10.405]  The news and why it matters.
[01:45:11.545 --> 01:45:12.445]  And it does matter.
[01:45:13.908 --> 01:45:31.996]  And one of the things that I actually was getting messages in the break, people were saying, Owen, one of the reasons why parents are afraid to speak out against the trans agenda, because they get threatened by liberals that they're going to send CPS to take their kids, and they're going to lose parental rights.
[01:45:32.577 --> 01:45:35.258]  And so there's definitely an aspect of that happening, Sarah.
[01:45:35.338 --> 01:45:38.920]  I don't know if you have any more personal experience with that, or you know other parents that have said that.
[01:45:39.813 --> 01:45:46.838]  So I want to talk on that, why parents are so afraid to speak out against this agenda in the classrooms, in the hospitals.
[01:45:46.878 --> 01:46:05.540]   But first, do you agree, I think 50% of the motivational factor to these events, and that's why there's all the hoopla, that's why there's all the hype, that's why there's all the media, Sexualizing and grooming kids is a get conservative moment for the left.
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:11.383]  They really view this as a let's stick it to conservatives, let's stick it to Christians, let's stick it to Republicans.
[01:46:12.143 --> 01:46:13.664]  By grooming children?
[01:46:14.184 --> 01:46:15.705]  By sexualizing children?
[01:46:15.725 --> 01:46:30.513]   Like, if you can't take a look in the mirror and realize that you have fallen way far from the moral compass, that you have fallen into the depths of evil, That you're going to use children to stick it to conservatives?
[01:46:30.894 --> 01:46:32.395]  But that's what I see going on.
[01:46:32.795 --> 01:46:33.736]  I see it at these events.
[01:46:33.836 --> 01:46:35.277]  I see it at the gay pride parades.
[01:46:35.817 --> 01:46:48.326]  Half of the motivational factor here is, let's be as flagrantly abusive of children, flagrantly as sexual deviant as possible in public, because that'll own the conservatives.
[01:46:48.626 --> 01:46:49.347]  Do you agree with that?
[01:46:50.751 --> 01:46:51.051]  I do.
[01:46:51.611 --> 01:46:52.512]  I absolutely do.
[01:46:52.852 --> 01:46:58.015]  It has become own the cons to the extent that we will ruin our own children, too, by the way.
[01:46:58.055 --> 01:46:59.576]  I mean, I think that that's important to point out.
[01:46:59.596 --> 01:47:02.017]  We're not even just talking about someone else's children.
[01:47:02.077 --> 01:47:22.885]   You have liberal families, liberal moms and dads who are willing to sacrifice their own children at the altar of their religion, which, as we all know, is their political ideology, especially when you talk about the LGBTQIA plus semicolon crowd, this is their religion.
[01:47:22.885 --> 01:47:26.685]  They live and die for this particular ideology.
[01:47:26.685 --> 01:47:31.846]   So I guess it should come as no surprise that they are willing to commit child sacrifice
[01:47:31.846 --> 01:47:34.206]  in order to achieve their goals.
[01:47:34.206 --> 01:47:39.966]   But I also think the other part of it is that we've allowed them to gain so much traction.
[01:47:40.006 --> 01:47:42.927]  We've allowed them to control so much of the conversation.
[01:47:42.967 --> 01:47:44.747]  We've completely given up our power.
[01:47:44.787 --> 01:47:58.891]  And I do understand what you're talking about and what the viewers out there, you know, they feel trapped because you're either going to have CPS called on you or you're going to be, you know, found out as a red hat wearer and get fired from your job or whatever the case may be.
[01:47:58.931 --> 01:48:02.353]  But I think that in that moment, we really are giving up our power.
[01:48:02.393 --> 01:48:03.813]  I think we saw that during COVID.
[01:48:04.113 --> 01:48:06.694]  I think we see this during the LGBTQ conversation.
[01:48:06.734 --> 01:48:16.459]  I think we're seeing it over and over again that people are forgetting that there are a lot more of us out there than we realize because we're all so afraid to speak up.
[01:48:16.779 --> 01:48:22.882]  I mean, imagine, if you will, if we would have just spoken up against all of the mask mandates and the vaccine mandates.
[01:48:22.922 --> 01:48:26.964]  And I know I'm kind of getting going to another topic here, but it's all related.
[01:48:27.504 --> 01:48:31.109]  Imagine if we had spoken up and enough of us had said, no, I'm not going to get the damn shot.
[01:48:31.349 --> 01:48:34.313]  Enough of the nurses at the hospital said, no, I'm not going to get the damn shot.
[01:48:34.353 --> 01:48:37.356]  And they all walked out and there were no nurses to treat any patients.
[01:48:37.717 --> 01:48:39.078]  What do you think the hospitals would have done?
[01:48:39.179 --> 01:48:40.801]  It's the same thing in this instance.
[01:48:41.141 --> 01:48:42.222]  There are enough of us.
[01:48:42.563 --> 01:48:45.727]  We have the power, but we're just giving it away because we're too scared.
[01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:52.102]  Well, and this goes back to what you said at the beginning here.
[01:48:52.563 --> 01:48:57.285]  Because people didn't speak out about the gay agenda, now here we are.
[01:48:58.065 --> 01:49:05.349]  And they properly posed themselves saying, look, if you don't like this, you're a bigot.
[01:49:05.549 --> 01:49:06.909]  And people don't want to be called a bigot.
[01:49:06.949 --> 01:49:08.010]  They don't want to be called a racist.
[01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:09.171]  They don't want to be referred to as that.
[01:49:09.211 --> 01:49:11.852]  So they just kind of let their guard down and they just said, fine.
[01:49:12.432 --> 01:49:21.757]  If gay people want to get married, no big deal, no skin off my nose, whatever, I'm not going to fight this, I'm not going to be called a bigot, I'm not going to be called a homophobe.
[01:49:22.617 --> 01:49:31.441]  Not realizing at the time that was just pushing you down that slippery slope, pushing our culture, pushing our civilization down that slippery slope.
[01:49:31.801 --> 01:49:37.004]  We thought, alright, fine, whatever, gay marriage, leave us alone, have your gay marriage, we're done with it, we're not going to debate you anymore.
[01:49:37.524 --> 01:49:45.955]   Now they Are having us debate whether they should be not just sexually grooming kids in the classroom, but folks actually having sex acts with kids.
[01:49:45.975 --> 01:49:47.518]  I mean, that's the debate they want to have.
[01:49:48.279 --> 01:49:51.724]  We're teachers, liberal teachers, having sex with the students.
[01:49:52.165 --> 01:49:54.288]  But you know, here's what I think is sad about this.
[01:49:55.248 --> 01:49:59.390]  Why couldn't, and we are kind of getting off onto another lane, but like you said, it's all connected.
[01:49:59.810 --> 01:50:03.492]  Well, why wouldn't more nurses stand up and refuse to take the vaccine?
[01:50:03.512 --> 01:50:07.053]  Or why wouldn't more workers in government stand up and refuse to take the vaccine?
[01:50:07.734 --> 01:50:16.698]  Our country has been under such attack and such sabotage for so long, that the majority of Americans are now living paycheck to paycheck, and they feel they can't!
[01:50:17.158 --> 01:50:22.160]  They feel they can't take that risk, because if they don't have their job next week, they're not paying their bills!
[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:47.703]   And so, you know, We have so many problems right now that are just all cascading down on us, and the most frustrating part is that we're refusing to address the root cause of any of it, and we have to sit here and debate whether or not kids should be sexualized in classrooms, instead of looking up and saying, that's not a debate, that's criminal, let's have an actual debate about why our country is in such a bad state.
[01:50:48.223 --> 01:50:52.386]  Now we're having to debate whether or not you should be sexually grooming children in hospitals?
[01:50:52.626 --> 01:50:56.389]  That's the left putting us in their debate arena once again!
[01:50:57.955 --> 01:51:16.830]  Yeah, I mean it's because they have been the ones who have controlled the narrative for so long and so they were able to push and push and push and now we're constantly on the defense and they've done a really great job, by the way, of infiltrating the classrooms, of making sure that it's all of them that are infiltrating the education system, academia, the medical community.
[01:51:17.130 --> 01:51:26.418]  They have done a very slow and incremental, you know, move where they have just very slowly and methodically infiltrated themselves into all of these places.
[01:51:26.898 --> 01:51:35.280]  And to that extent that I saw so many teachers at this drag show event for kids, at this family-friendly event.
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:44.522]  I sat next to a public school teacher, which it was a male who was married, but he was there by himself because his wife didn't want to come, so try to work that one out in your head.
[01:51:44.582 --> 01:51:49.543]  But I was sitting next to him and he was talking about all of these right-wing people he had to deal with.
[01:51:49.563 --> 01:51:50.303]  Did he have monkey pox?
[01:51:50.323 --> 01:51:51.663]  Sounds like he might have had monkey pox.
[01:51:53.129 --> 01:51:53.589]  I don't know.
[01:51:53.669 --> 01:51:55.832]  I didn't want to get close enough to find out.
[01:51:55.952 --> 01:52:09.127]  But he's talking about all of these right-wing nutjobs who, you know, these parents who come in and actually think that they want to, you know, that they should have a say in their child's curriculum and how horrible they were.
[01:52:09.227 --> 01:52:10.809]  And the other lady next to me was...
[01:52:11.109 --> 01:52:15.868]   agreeing and saying she has so many friends who are educators who have really seen, it's
[01:52:15.868 --> 01:52:19.109]   the conservatives who are now infiltrating the school boards.
[01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:21.948]   I would say we're taking it back, but that's a whole other story.
[01:52:21.948 --> 01:52:26.628]   But the amount of teachers, there was one point where one of the drag queens said he
[01:52:26.628 --> 01:52:28.509]  used to be a teacher.
[01:52:28.509 --> 01:52:31.349]   He taught high school, he taught history, he taught all of these things.
[01:52:31.349 --> 01:52:33.849]  And they asked how many teachers were in the house.
[01:52:33.849 --> 01:52:37.307]  And there were a ton, I mean, it was raucous applause.
[01:52:37.307 --> 01:52:42.669]   Our friend Taylor Hanson, he was over there at the event with me and he actually got voice
[01:52:42.669 --> 01:52:47.449]   recording of a teacher talking about, she said that she was with Keller ISD school district
[01:52:47.449 --> 01:52:49.449]  and she said that there were a ton of teachers.
[01:52:49.561 --> 01:52:55.561]   that were there and they were just trying to keep it on the down low and they had to remove some posts on their social
[01:52:55.561 --> 01:52:58.561]   media but they were all banding together and they were all
[01:52:58.561 --> 01:53:01.461]   showing up to this event in support of it and these are the people
[01:53:01.461 --> 01:53:06.461]   who are teaching the next generation. They have done this on purpose, Owen, because they know if they can control the
[01:53:06.461 --> 01:53:09.461]   minds of the youth, they can control everything.
[01:53:09.461 --> 01:53:13.461]   Well, and you think about the classroom. It's obviously, you know,
[01:53:13.461 --> 01:53:19.461]   the trust we put in teachers is about as big as a trust we put into any individual, any worker
[01:53:19.461 --> 01:53:21.461]  And it's a very...
[01:53:21.374 --> 01:53:22.434]  Compromising situation.
[01:53:22.494 --> 01:53:24.495]  You leave your kids with this individual all day.
[01:53:25.015 --> 01:53:25.575]  And you know what?
[01:53:26.115 --> 01:53:28.976]  I know plenty of people that love kids in a wholesome way.
[01:53:29.076 --> 01:53:29.996]  They love kids.
[01:53:30.016 --> 01:53:31.317]  They like uplifting kids.
[01:53:31.597 --> 01:53:34.178]  And they like seeing kids grow and become better people.
[01:53:34.478 --> 01:53:36.318]  And those are the people that become teachers.
[01:53:36.578 --> 01:53:41.060]  But see, now you realize there's another type of person that wants to get into the classroom.
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:43.200]  And they don't love kids because they love them.
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:45.161]  They love kids because they're attracted to them.
[01:53:46.521 --> 01:53:48.902]  So they want us to have a debate now.
[01:53:50.157 --> 01:53:56.846]  Whether or not liberals should be allowed to sexually groom and even have sex with kids in the classroom.
[01:53:56.866 --> 01:53:57.908]  I'm not even kidding you folks.
[01:53:57.948 --> 01:54:05.639]  This is the debate they want to have after a Franklin High School teacher who was having sexual intercourse with the students got caught.
[01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:11.484]  And he was called a pedophile, and the other teachers are saying, don't you dare call him a pedophile.
[01:54:11.524 --> 01:54:13.185]  He's a minor attracted person.
[01:54:13.565 --> 01:54:15.186]  Pedophiles are too marginalized.
[01:54:15.727 --> 01:54:16.027]  Really?
[01:54:16.067 --> 01:54:17.868]  People that rape children are marginalized?
[01:54:17.928 --> 01:54:19.490]  Probably not marginalized enough.
[01:54:19.890 --> 01:54:22.632]  They probably shouldn't even exist, if you catch my drift.
[01:54:23.352 --> 01:54:24.253]  But they're there.
[01:54:24.393 --> 01:54:29.477]  And so, what do you think is behind this new re-wording of pedophile?
[01:54:29.557 --> 01:54:32.900]  And now they want to say that it's a minor attracted person.
[01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:34.541]  What do you think is behind that, Sarah?
[01:54:35.879 --> 01:54:39.941]  Yeah, I mean, obviously they want to invoke some sort of empathy for these people.
[01:54:39.981 --> 01:54:42.902]  They want to change the language, as we see them do all the time.
[01:54:42.962 --> 01:54:44.442]  This is how they change the narrative.
[01:54:44.482 --> 01:54:48.024]  This is how they meet their agenda, is by changing the language.
[01:54:48.064 --> 01:54:58.648]  And so instead of calling someone a pedophile, because that has a stigma, this poor pedophile, this poor, you know, kid diddler might feel offended that you are calling them out on their perversion.
[01:54:59.148 --> 01:55:06.669]  And so they need to find something a little bit gentler to say that makes it sound like they don't actually have any control over it.
[01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:08.230]  They're just born this way, right?
[01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:10.090]  So we're seeing them shift this.
[01:55:10.110 --> 01:55:14.451]  We're seeing this change the language simply because these are disgusting people.
[01:55:14.551 --> 01:55:21.432]  These are perverted people and they want to satisfy their fantasies of doing things with young children.
[01:55:21.552 --> 01:55:23.532]  It really is as simple as that.
[01:55:23.612 --> 01:55:33.618]   And you know, I do think there's also a certain component of this that Again, we talked about them doing this slowly and methodically and the right just standing back and saying, I don't want to get involved.
[01:55:33.998 --> 01:55:39.222]  I want, for whatever reason, some of them, you know, very real reasons, but they said, I don't want to get involved.
[01:55:39.662 --> 01:55:48.229]  I'm going to just do my thing with my family and I'm going to go to work and I'm going to work hard and I'm going to come home and whatever, you know, whoever wants to marry each other, they can do that.
[01:55:48.429 --> 01:55:51.131]  Whoever wants to, you know, let me, let me give you this one.
[01:55:52.768 --> 01:56:03.456]  Everyone I've talked to, or I should say a lot of people that I've talked to about adult drag shows will say, they always want to preface it and say, I only have a problem if it's under 18, if it's for kids.
[01:56:03.897 --> 01:56:06.359]  I don't have a problem with adults going to drag shows.
[01:56:06.379 --> 01:56:06.959]  Well, you know what?
[01:56:07.399 --> 01:56:07.780]  I do.
[01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:10.962]  And I think it's a big problem that nobody has a problem with drag shows.
[01:56:11.082 --> 01:56:12.483]  I'm not saying you should go and ban it.
[01:56:12.743 --> 01:56:13.924]  I'm not saying you should protest it.
[01:56:13.964 --> 01:56:31.357]   But the idea that we should be celebrating, I mean, I couldn't fathom as a woman, Making money, bringing money to an event, turning around and handing my hard-earned money over to a bunch of grown men who are appropriating my sex and my gender.
[01:56:31.658 --> 01:56:36.261]  It boggles the mind why that would be something that would be great.
[01:56:36.921 --> 01:56:44.266]  It basically is all of the trans movement, the drag queen movement, all of these things are basically the actual patriarchy.
[01:56:44.506 --> 01:56:47.308]  You know, the left insisted that there was this patriarchy for so long.
[01:56:47.648 --> 01:56:48.809]  This is the patriarchy.
[01:56:48.889 --> 01:56:53.191]   This is women in This is women encouraging these grown men to appropriate their gender.
[01:56:53.251 --> 01:56:59.034]  This is women giving away their hard-earned money to men simply for impersonating them.
[01:56:59.334 --> 01:57:09.559]  It is so wild to me that this is acceptable in society and everyone goes along with it and goes and has, you know, champagne and mimosas and kicks back and enjoys it and smiles and laughs.
[01:57:09.639 --> 01:57:11.940]  And I'm going, how the hell did we even get here?
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:18.003]  I mean, maybe I'm a prude, Owen, but it just, it feels a lot like we just had this thing where we go, you know what?
[01:57:19.159 --> 01:57:22.080]  I'm okay with it, as long as it's not for kids.
[01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:30.864]  And they knew, the left knew, if they could get us used to this, if they could normalize this kind of behavior, that eventually they could trickle it down to the children.
[01:57:31.384 --> 01:57:33.465]  And now we're seeing that happen in the schools.
[01:57:34.275 --> 01:58:04.244]   Well there's no doubt the crossroads of Christianity in the West and freedom in the West left kind of a void where we do respect freedom and we are tolerant so we let our culture kind of degrade itself and we let the Cardi B's and the Megan Thee Stallions become and the Kim Kardashians become role models for our little girls because we believe in freedom and freedom of choice and that does come with consequences but I think the proper measurement Hey, you know what?
[01:58:04.565 --> 01:58:05.427]  We're going to be Christians.
[01:58:05.447 --> 01:58:07.292]  We have our values, but we also appreciate freedom.
[01:58:07.312 --> 01:58:09.798]  We realize how important that is for the prosperity of our country.
[01:58:10.239 --> 01:58:12.124]  But you know, when you talk about the issue...
[01:58:13.065 --> 01:58:16.904]   of men dressing like women, how is it any different than blackface?
[01:58:16.904 --> 01:58:22.505]   I'm yet to see a legitimate explanation for that because I mean God knows if you do blackface,
[01:58:22.505 --> 01:58:26.305]   unless you're a liberal Democrat, Jimmy Kimmel, Justin Trudeau, you can do blackface all day
[01:58:26.305 --> 01:58:27.305]  long.
[01:58:27.305 --> 01:58:30.465]  What's the host, Joy Bayh-Ark, she can do blackface.
[01:58:30.465 --> 01:58:36.385]   But oh, but a man pretending to be a woman though, that's not offensive at all.
[01:58:36.352 --> 01:58:42.824]  If anything it's more offensive because it's not like people in blackface are going out actually pretending to be black to make money.
[01:58:43.264 --> 01:58:46.711]  These are men actually pretending to be women to make money!
[01:58:48.689 --> 01:58:57.355]  Yeah, I mean, and that's why I used the term appropriating our gender on purpose because this is, I'm using the left's language.
[01:58:57.395 --> 01:58:58.556]  This is the left's own language.
[01:58:58.596 --> 01:59:02.358]  You are not allowed to, as you pointed out, you're not allowed to do blackface.
[01:59:02.378 --> 01:59:16.347]  You're not allowed to dress as a certain, you know, maybe I remember a story a while back of a girl that went to prom and wore a Japanese style outfit, but she wasn't Japanese and she was making headlines for this.
[01:59:16.628 --> 01:59:17.588]  I mean, you're not allowed to eat.
[01:59:18.628 --> 01:59:23.047]   Certain food that is outside your culture. Everything is cultural appropriation yet
[01:59:23.047 --> 01:59:28.128]   somehow we have these people these men who are profiting off of
[01:59:28.128 --> 01:59:32.868]   impersonating women and they are appropriating our gender and
[01:59:32.868 --> 01:59:38.628]   Weirdly enough women are just celebrating it. They are they're willing to fund it
[01:59:38.628 --> 01:59:43.048]   It is the it is the wildest thing that I have ever seen and like I said
[01:59:43.048 --> 01:59:47.229]   I'm not saying I'm trying to take away an adult freedom to go to a drag show
[01:59:47.229 --> 01:59:55.500]   show but I'm saying it should be it should be it should be That's something that they should do in secret because they know that society will be disgusted with them.
[01:59:55.580 --> 02:00:08.693]  That's how I feel about it and the fact that the women have cheered this on, the women are cheering on the sexualization of their own young girls, of their own young boys, is just absolutely reprehensible.
[02:00:09.821 --> 02:00:10.441]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:00:10.562 --> 02:00:15.005]  Kim Kardashian has every right to slut it up and become a billionaire.
[02:00:15.165 --> 02:00:15.905]  Perfectly fine.
[02:00:16.486 --> 02:00:19.868]  And I have every right to say that she's a horrible influence on little girls.
[02:00:19.928 --> 02:00:20.788]  That's how this goes.
[02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:30.835]  But, you know, getting back to the change of the verbology here, or the words here, where they want to consider it a minor attracted person because too much of a stigma comes along with pedophile.
[02:00:31.155 --> 02:00:31.636]  Okay, fine.
[02:00:31.656 --> 02:00:32.857]  You know what?
[02:00:32.997 --> 02:00:35.739]  I'll even humor you and I'll go into that arena for a debate.
[02:00:36.599 --> 02:00:38.401]  We have all kinds of problems in this country.
[02:00:39.342 --> 02:00:44.348]  We have problems with alcohol abuse, and alcoholics, and drug abuse, and sex addicts, and all this stuff.
[02:00:44.388 --> 02:00:45.289]  And what do we do?
[02:00:45.689 --> 02:00:48.612]  We say, you have a problem, you need help.
[02:00:48.893 --> 02:00:54.159]  You have a mental disorder, or you have a physical disorder, and a reliance on a chemical that's bad for you.
[02:00:55.083 --> 02:00:58.484]  You need to address that and you need help and you need to get that under control.
[02:00:59.025 --> 02:01:09.429]  So if you, if, if, and I'm humoring here, if you want to say minor attracted person is a mental disorder, I don't know what it's like to be a minor attracted person, okay?
[02:01:09.509 --> 02:01:10.469]  I'm not even going to try.
[02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:12.030]  So I can't relate to that.
[02:01:13.171 --> 02:01:16.212]  But okay, let's say that's a real thing and you can't help it.
[02:01:16.852 --> 02:01:24.894]  Well, just like somebody that's an alcoholic or a drug abuser or a gambling addict, you need help and you need to put that under control.
[02:01:25.154 --> 02:01:29.755]  So this would be like you showing up to Alcoholics Anonymous and we give you a keg of beer.
[02:01:30.075 --> 02:01:33.595]  You show up to a sex addicts meeting and we bring you three hookers.
[02:01:34.435 --> 02:01:42.337]  No, if you're a minor attractive person, we're not putting you in the classroom, we're not putting you at Drag Queen Storytime, we're getting you away from children.
[02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:49.846]  Yeah, and I think it goes back to what we were talking about earlier with the medical community.
[02:01:49.886 --> 02:01:58.596]  They have been infiltrated by all of these radicalists, by all of these perverted people, and they are controlling the narrative.
[02:01:58.616 --> 02:02:03.620]   They're controlling the narrative when it comes to, you know, What is deemed acceptable and what is deemed a disorder.
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:13.161]  We've seen them change the manuals that they're using, that they're teaching to all of these psychology students to not include gender dysphoria as a disorder anymore.
[02:02:13.201 --> 02:02:25.543]  I mean, we are seeing them change the language in real time so that the medical community will accept this as normalized and push this oftentimes on teams, on people.
[02:02:25.603 --> 02:02:28.984]  I mean, all of their agenda is being purported.
[02:02:30.894 --> 02:02:38.418]  And so it's difficult to see how we navigate back to this because they will always have an expert to back up what they are saying.
[02:02:39.118 --> 02:02:42.980]  I just do want to point out though, Owen, touch on something that you said earlier.
[02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:46.381]  It is a fact that dead pedophiles do not reoffend.
[02:02:47.582 --> 02:02:48.502]  Well, that is a fact.
[02:02:48.522 --> 02:02:49.783]  I don't think you can deny that.
[02:02:51.346 --> 02:02:58.270]  And that's, folks, again, this is the most heinous crime you can commit is a sexual act against a child.
[02:02:58.790 --> 02:03:05.373]  And the fact that we're sitting here acting like, oh, you're a poor victim, you're marginalized because you're sexually abusing children.
[02:03:05.393 --> 02:03:07.775]  I mean, that just shows you were total Twilight Zone.
[02:03:08.135 --> 02:03:09.376]  One segment left with Sarah Gonzalez.
[02:03:09.396 --> 02:03:09.876]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:03:11.269 --> 02:03:14.070]  One segment left with our guest, Sarah Gonzales.
[02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:15.730]  She's a host over at The Blaze.
[02:03:16.710 --> 02:03:19.531]  Host of The News and Why It Matters.
[02:03:19.611 --> 02:03:23.131]  And you can follow her on Twitter right there, at SarahGonzalesTX.
[02:03:23.872 --> 02:03:40.315]  Sarah, here's the big final question I have for you, and we can hone in on this question with the topic that we've been discussing in this hour with the clear sexual grooming of children going on, the clear promotion of pedophilia that's going on.
[02:03:41.485 --> 02:03:48.267]  But the question I have for you really expands to everything else, so if you want to answer it on the subject material and then expand afterwards, feel free.
[02:03:49.567 --> 02:03:57.069]  The question is, let's say you see your school sexually grooming kids, doing the gay pride stuff, everything else.
[02:03:58.729 --> 02:03:59.289]  You have a choice.
[02:04:00.029 --> 02:04:03.090]  Do you leave the school, or do you fight?
[02:04:04.127 --> 02:04:09.212]  Do you leave that community that's becoming blue and crime ridden and socialist?
[02:04:09.452 --> 02:04:10.653]  Or do you stay and fight?
[02:04:10.773 --> 02:04:15.898]  And it just expands as you get from the local level to the national level.
[02:04:15.918 --> 02:04:20.041]  But I mean, isn't that the existential question that we all have right now as Americans?
[02:04:20.942 --> 02:04:28.508]  Do I just go, do I just leave Austin, Texas and go find a place on a lake or in the woods where there's not gonna be a Democrat within a hundred miles, thank God?
[02:04:29.009 --> 02:04:35.474]  Or do I stay here and try to save American culture and conservative values in these blue cities?
[02:04:35.814 --> 02:04:37.496]  But on the school issue, start with that.
[02:04:38.036 --> 02:04:40.238]  Do you fight it or do you leave it?
[02:04:41.781 --> 02:04:46.284]  So I think that you can do both at the same time when it comes to the schools.
[02:04:46.545 --> 02:04:50.528]  And what I mean by that is, I have a little bit of personal experience in this actually.
[02:04:50.908 --> 02:04:58.593]  My older son, I had at a charter school, I worked very hard to find this charter school for him because I did not want to put him in regular public school.
[02:04:58.674 --> 02:05:00.455]  And I thought that I had a good thing going.
[02:05:00.795 --> 02:05:04.358]  I vetted them very heavily and it turned out through COVID, they went insane.
[02:05:05.089 --> 02:05:11.851]  They did the mask mandates when kids went back to school and I said, there's no way in hell that my son is going to wear a mask.
[02:05:12.271 --> 02:05:12.952]  We're not doing this.
[02:05:12.992 --> 02:05:18.574]  Then later I found out that they had a Black Lives Matter mural up in the hallways for all the children to see, but that's a different story.
[02:05:18.634 --> 02:05:22.135]  So I realized I can't subject my son to this right now.
[02:05:22.235 --> 02:05:28.517]  So what I did was I left, we left the school and I homeschooled him for the entire semester with a newborn, by the way.
[02:05:28.637 --> 02:05:31.538]  I was completely unprepared to do it, but I said, it doesn't matter.
[02:05:31.938 --> 02:05:37.244]  I have to get my son out of this school because what they're going to do is going to hurt him.
[02:05:37.664 --> 02:05:39.386]  So I left the school.
[02:05:39.506 --> 02:05:40.367]  I pulled my son out.
[02:05:40.847 --> 02:05:42.129]  I did a stopgap, right?
[02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:43.270]  I put a band-aid on it.
[02:05:43.951 --> 02:05:45.893]  But in the meantime, I still fought.
[02:05:46.053 --> 02:05:48.836]  I fought against all of the mask mandates in all of the schools.
[02:05:49.156 --> 02:05:52.380]  I fought against what the school boards were doing in the area.
[02:05:52.980 --> 02:05:57.585]  I still fought the school, but I needed to remove my son from the toxic situation.
[02:05:57.625 --> 02:06:14.453]   And that's what I would encourage everyone to do, at least when it comes to schools, because I know a lot of people say, trust me, I understand people work, people work very hard, they have long hours, the thought of homeschooling their children sometimes is just, it seems like it just, it can't happen, but
[02:06:16.013 --> 02:06:28.399]  If I can do it, I promise you, there are often times where it is really not that expensive and it doesn't take the time that public school takes because you're not a glorified babysitter, you're actually getting the curriculum done.
[02:06:28.439 --> 02:06:34.362]  So I would encourage parents to look at that and at least remove their children from the toxic environment while they fight.
[02:06:34.622 --> 02:06:36.243]  So I think that you can do both.
[02:06:36.363 --> 02:06:44.807]   I would say when it comes to the larger aspect of communities, I would look at what was it When you moved there.
[02:06:44.967 --> 02:06:56.055]  If you live in a place, because when you decided to move to that place, or the place had always been like that, because this place had a certain mindset, the community had a certain vibe.
[02:06:56.095 --> 02:07:04.122]  I mean, like it or not, I know the left wants to just have this melting pot of all these different people and diversity and all these different things, but that's not how community works.
[02:07:04.162 --> 02:07:07.744]  Community has to have cohesive values and cohesive morals.
[02:07:08.004 --> 02:07:12.468]  And if you don't have that, you don't have a functional community, which is why we're seeing what we're seeing happening.
[02:07:12.868 --> 02:07:19.331]  So, I think that it is important that if this is the community that you grew up in and you look around and you say, I don't recognize this anymore.
[02:07:19.411 --> 02:07:25.294]  I think you say and you fight, but you got to remove your kids from the fallout at the schools that they're being taught, right?
[02:07:25.314 --> 02:07:26.955]  You always have to protect your children first.
[02:07:27.415 --> 02:07:28.596]  I think that you can do that.
[02:07:28.636 --> 02:07:39.521]  I think that you can do both while you fight, but you definitely fight to either take back your community, your state, your country in some matters, as obviously we're seeing.
[02:07:40.061 --> 02:07:45.544]  Um, but certainly you don't move to a community and then try to change it as we see the left always do.
[02:07:46.084 --> 02:07:47.005]  This is your community.
[02:07:47.145 --> 02:07:51.087]  It is yours to take back if you so choose to take back your power.
[02:07:51.387 --> 02:07:57.291]  And I think that if we see people go to these school board meetings, if people have to ask themselves, when is the last time I went to a city council meeting?
[02:07:57.611 --> 02:07:59.632]  When is the last time I went to a school board meeting?
[02:07:59.672 --> 02:08:01.193]  When is the last time that I pushed back?
[02:08:01.713 --> 02:08:08.437]  I gotta tell you, before our friend Alex Stein, there was nobody showing up at these meetings trying to press back on these people.
[02:08:08.457 --> 02:08:09.477]  They are not used to it.
[02:08:09.817 --> 02:08:21.784]  So there is so much that we can be doing, and we just have to make the time to do it because it is so, so important that we maintain and take back control of our communities, if not for us, at least for our children.
[02:08:23.063 --> 02:08:23.803]  You know, that's so funny.
[02:08:23.823 --> 02:08:27.005]  You mentioned the Alex Stein thing and you're right.
[02:08:27.145 --> 02:08:28.365]  Nobody watches this stuff.
[02:08:28.405 --> 02:08:35.889]  In fact, I used to go to, we have the Citizens Communication is what they call it here at the Austin City Council.
[02:08:35.929 --> 02:08:45.533]   I used to go to it like once a month and then by the fourth or fifth time, because I, you know, I actually would try to be serious and like bring up serious problems so nobody really cares.
[02:08:45.933 --> 02:08:49.274]  By the fifth time I was doing it, Mayor Adler here, he wouldn't even show up.
[02:08:49.314 --> 02:08:50.175]  He'd leave the room.
[02:08:50.495 --> 02:08:53.556]  He'd just leave the room when I would get on the podium because he's such a coward.
[02:08:53.876 --> 02:08:56.877]  And then the other city council members ended up following the same suit.
[02:08:57.117 --> 02:09:03.720]  So I would be at the podium and there'd only be two members of like a ten-member city council here and only two would be left over.
[02:09:03.780 --> 02:09:05.401]  Those are the conservatives that actually want to listen.
[02:09:05.721 --> 02:09:07.381]  So I quit doing it because it was a waste of time.
[02:09:07.742 --> 02:09:08.242]  But you're right.
[02:09:09.002 --> 02:09:16.247]  What was genius about what Stein did is he took the element of comedy and culture jamming and just shoved it in their face.
[02:09:16.587 --> 02:09:38.677]   And I would argue that if you combined every city council meeting in the history of this country and then you combine the views that Alex Stein got at his city council meeting, I think Alex Stein has made more people watch a city council meeting and put more energy and focus on city council meetings than any other person, individual, issue of all time.
[02:09:38.677 --> 02:09:43.099]   But doesn't that just show how so much of what our government does, especially at the
[02:09:43.099 --> 02:09:45.898]  local level, it's just ceremonious.
[02:09:45.898 --> 02:09:49.618]   They get into these positions, they fluff themselves up, they tell their friends how
[02:09:49.618 --> 02:09:50.858]  prestigious they are.
[02:09:50.858 --> 02:09:52.497]  Look at me, I'm on the city council.
[02:09:52.536 --> 02:09:55.219]  Look at me, I've got a big chair and I've got a name placard.
[02:09:55.820 --> 02:09:56.740]  Aren't I a big deal?
[02:09:57.021 --> 02:10:01.024]  But when it comes to actually showing up, doing a job and taking care of things, they're not there.
[02:10:01.465 --> 02:10:08.592]  I think that issue has been highlighted so much now because Stein just goes and does a comedic routine and it's like nothing really changes.
[02:10:08.772 --> 02:10:11.014]  They didn't care before, they still don't care after.
[02:10:12.884 --> 02:10:14.505]  Yeah, no, I totally agree with you.
[02:10:14.525 --> 02:10:23.852]  And it really is, it's astounding sometimes to watch the disdain on their faces that they have when he is coming up and speaking in front of them.
[02:10:23.892 --> 02:10:27.834]  Because, look, I mean, say what you will about Alex's bits.
[02:10:27.975 --> 02:10:30.616]  I think they're, as you said, I think that they're genius.
[02:10:30.656 --> 02:10:31.457]  I think that they're great.
[02:10:31.517 --> 02:10:48.054]   But just the level of disdain that these people have when he comes up and talks to them and They speak to him as if he doesn't have the right to address them because they're just so used to, for so long, people just, I mean, they didn't have anyone at these school board meetings, at these city council meetings.
[02:10:48.094 --> 02:10:49.616]  They didn't think anyone was paying attention.
[02:10:50.197 --> 02:10:51.478]  And I agree with you, they do.
[02:10:51.578 --> 02:10:56.745]  They think that this is their, you know, they're in power and they're in control and they have forgotten somewhere along the way.
[02:10:57.105 --> 02:11:00.266]  That they are supposed to serve the people, the people are not supposed to serve them.
[02:11:00.586 --> 02:11:19.751]  But I think that the more pushback that they get, I mean, imagine if there were, you know, maybe comedy isn't your thing, but if there were at least a bunch of Alex Steins or Owen Schroyers who just pack the room, fill the room at every single one of those meetings, can they walk away from everyone every single time?
[02:11:20.151 --> 02:11:27.140]  I would argue that they would be scared of the fallout of doing so because they would see that the tide has turned against them.
[02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:32.768]  As we know, these politicians, even down to the local level, all they care about is remaining in office.
[02:11:33.757 --> 02:11:42.000]  If you put the pressure on them enough in numbers, and we don't give up our power, and we put the pressure on them in droves, they're going to want to get re-elected.
[02:11:42.220 --> 02:11:50.062]  And they're going to, you know, think that the only way that they can do that is to cater to whatever the popular political ideology is.
[02:11:50.422 --> 02:11:57.806]  Sadly, I mean, I wish that it wasn't that way, but that seems to be what politics has become, is just whoever screams the loudest gets what they want.
[02:11:57.846 --> 02:12:00.747]  Which is why, I would say, which is why you see this.
[02:12:01.607 --> 02:12:04.109]  How many trans people do we have in this country?
[02:12:04.169 --> 02:12:07.010]  It's like a tiny, minute population.
[02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:08.011]  Is it even 1%?
[02:12:09.351 --> 02:12:17.900]  And they have been able to grab the message, and they have been able to drive the narrative because they are the ones screaming the loudest.
[02:12:17.940 --> 02:12:19.282]  The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
[02:12:19.822 --> 02:12:22.565]  And again, I just think that we've given this up for so long.
[02:12:22.664 --> 02:12:26.625]   I know a lot of people feel like there's no hope at all, but I would say if you feel like
[02:12:26.625 --> 02:12:32.784]   there's no hope, what's the harm in just taking this last ditch effort, banding together,
[02:12:32.784 --> 02:12:36.305]   showing up at these school board meetings, showing up at the city council meetings, showing
[02:12:36.305 --> 02:12:40.944]   up at the Capitol, showing up, by the way, to all of these drag shows, even if it's just
[02:12:40.944 --> 02:12:42.265]  a protest, whatever.
[02:12:42.265 --> 02:12:46.265]   I would encourage everyone to follow my social media because I am working on, we're in the
[02:12:46.265 --> 02:12:52.984]   works of creating a non-profit that is going to mobilize people, parents in these areas,
[02:12:52.984 --> 02:12:57.783]   in these communities where these drag shows are happening, and make sure that they can
[02:12:57.783 --> 02:13:02.225]   make a difference, whether it be protesting, whether it be infiltrating the event, whether
[02:13:02.225 --> 02:13:07.344]   it be, you know, we are going to mobilize parents who are willing and members of the
[02:13:07.344 --> 02:13:09.944]  community to actually do something about it.
[02:13:09.944 --> 02:13:11.784]  Yeah, and I would say it's already happening.
[02:13:11.798 --> 02:13:19.522]  Just look at all the overturns of the school boards that we've had in the last two years when people realized what the left was doing to the education system.
[02:13:19.562 --> 02:13:22.703]  And by the way, the trans community is not 1% of 1%.
[02:13:23.884 --> 02:13:25.525]  But if they get their way, it will be.
[02:13:25.605 --> 02:13:26.705]  Then it'll be 1%, then it'll be 10%.
[02:13:26.765 --> 02:13:28.746]  That's what they're really going for.
[02:13:28.786 --> 02:13:30.127]  Sarah Gonzales, thank you so much.
[02:13:30.187 --> 02:13:30.687]  Great stuff.

[02:14:46.681 --> 02:14:47.101]  Thank you.
[02:14:48.152 --> 02:14:48.592]  There I am.
[02:14:50.433 --> 02:14:51.653]  Well, I'm not Kay Daly.
[02:14:52.433 --> 02:14:55.534]  She's on another mission today, so I'm sitting in for her.
[02:14:56.014 --> 02:15:09.518]  But I am going to use some information that she sent me, and I'm going to talk to you a little bit about this, because I'm going to tell you, I'm in the middle of a storm, and you can imagine, I left off a word, you can imagine what kind of storm, over this issue of whether they're not viruses.
[02:15:09.638 --> 02:15:18.869]   I never meant to be in the middle of this, but It's a matter of sharing information and having people decide whether they believe it or not, you know, what other people confirm or deny.
[02:15:18.909 --> 02:15:19.810]  That's what science is.
[02:15:19.870 --> 02:15:21.172]  It isn't about shouting at each other.
[02:15:21.192 --> 02:15:23.876]  It's about sharing information and debating it, right?
[02:15:24.781 --> 02:15:29.642]  But I have come to the notion that there really aren't viruses the way we think they were.
[02:15:29.682 --> 02:15:32.283]  And I mentioned this the other day on Alex's show.
[02:15:32.883 --> 02:15:37.404]  But let me just make sure that you understand that doesn't mean there's not a disease.
[02:15:37.444 --> 02:15:43.866]  It doesn't mean that we haven't seen people dying, but we got to look at all the possibilities and not just look at viruses.
[02:15:44.466 --> 02:15:48.167]  So what I'm going to do this hour is I'm going to lay out what I know about this.
[02:15:48.747 --> 02:15:55.972]  And I'm going to start by talking about the pandemic of 1918 in a little more depth than I had a chance to the other day.
[02:15:56.452 --> 02:16:09.321]  But I think that we have to, this is, my kids have told me about the TLDR, you know, too long, did not read, that's for the guppies that have no, what do I want to say?
[02:16:11.281 --> 02:16:21.823]  Ability to keep their attention span so they can't read the whole article they just want to get the subset or they're too busy and here's my TLDR that I think that viruses and Genetics and stuff.
[02:16:22.303 --> 02:16:23.064]  It's it.
[02:16:23.224 --> 02:16:41.594]   They may be real somewhere out there I don't see any evidence of the viruses, but but not saying they don't completely exist I will say I think it's a false biologic narrative that we've been dealing with and And that it steers us away of real looking at real threats to humanity, which are the silent weapons of electromagnetic frequency.
[02:16:41.634 --> 02:16:44.777]  And that's what we're going to really talk about in the big section here.
[02:16:45.078 --> 02:16:48.842]  And remember this in Latin virus means toxin.
[02:16:49.565 --> 02:16:59.049]  I think we've been facing, as many on this show have pointed out, the chemtrails, the food poisoning, all the things that are going on.
[02:16:59.429 --> 02:17:05.852]  We've been subjected to electromagnetic frequency and toxins for a long time, and the toxins come in a variety of things.
[02:17:07.092 --> 02:17:09.253]  You know, not just vaccines.
[02:17:09.433 --> 02:17:12.274]  We've dealt with fluoride in the water for a long time.
[02:17:12.914 --> 02:17:14.555]  That's not conspiracy.
[02:17:14.615 --> 02:17:15.535]  That is fact.
[02:17:15.675 --> 02:17:17.736]  It's a conspiracy, but it's not a conspiracy theory.
[02:17:18.016 --> 02:17:19.156]  That's conspiracy fact.
[02:17:19.737 --> 02:17:26.279]  The fluoride in the water has been there for a reason, and even the EPA recognizes it damages your children's IQ.
[02:17:26.359 --> 02:17:27.339]  Why is it still there?
[02:17:27.799 --> 02:17:28.320]  I don't know.
[02:17:28.420 --> 02:17:29.820]  I've tried to get it out in my town.
[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:30.280]  I can't.
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:32.121]  So we've been faced with all these things.
[02:17:32.788 --> 02:17:39.799]  The other thing I'm going to say that I think is fairly provable is that the Great Reset is a nice term.
[02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:53.033]   What we're really facing here is an extinction-level event, and we need to Have all the brains working and figuring out what's going on because the real story here is that human beings are kept in the dark.
[02:17:53.653 --> 02:17:57.876]  And we, there are murderous technologic capabilities out there.
[02:17:58.277 --> 02:18:03.320]  We, the military industrial complex is multi, it's a multinational corporation.
[02:18:03.380 --> 02:18:05.442]  It's not just one nation against another.
[02:18:05.862 --> 02:18:09.845]  And we're little people are just seeing tips, you know, knowledge.
[02:18:10.325 --> 02:18:11.646]  I think really this is the story.
[02:18:12.107 --> 02:18:13.568]  I think of knowledge like a dartboard.
[02:18:14.128 --> 02:18:16.869]  At the center of the dartboard are the people that really know what's going on.
[02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:27.211]  Those of us trying to save lives in all this pandemic, the so-called pandemic, those of us trying to figure out what's been going on from the shedding to whatever, we're on the outside ring.
[02:18:27.551 --> 02:18:30.532]  Some of us may have worked in one ring, but we're not in the center.
[02:18:30.892 --> 02:18:37.053]  And so we have to talk to each other in a professional manner, all of us, and try and figure this out.
[02:18:37.093 --> 02:18:43.255]  And I'm just going to give you some more information that I think kind of clarifies in my mind where this is heading.
[02:18:44.496 --> 02:18:52.921]  Don't misunderstand the fact that the occulting of knowledge, the hiding of knowledge, is a very sophisticated art beyond our wildest expectations.
[02:18:53.021 --> 02:19:05.709]  So we're going to be taking a break here in a few seconds and when we come back I'm going to start talking about the pandemic and then what we learned from 1918 that I think is repeating here and then we'll go to electromagnetic frequencies.
[02:19:06.089 --> 02:19:07.590]  Thank you for inviting me on the show.
[02:19:08.857 --> 02:19:09.839]  Okay, well thank you.
[02:19:09.919 --> 02:19:10.880]  I'm Dr. Lee Merritt.
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:16.928]  You can usually find me at themedicalrebel.com, but I'm sitting in for Kate Daly today, who's out.
[02:19:17.389 --> 02:19:28.834]   But I've got to tell you, recently I did a big deep dive on my On my website, I have a little like a pseudo substack because I got demonetized from substack.
[02:19:29.235 --> 02:19:30.555]  It's all about what happened really in 1918.
[02:19:31.276 --> 02:19:33.877]  And it's important because it's happening again.
[02:19:33.897 --> 02:19:35.578]  In my opinion, it's happening again.
[02:19:35.979 --> 02:19:42.983]  And the thing that she pointed out to me, this is how this whole thing got started, is Kate said to me, you know, I have this news archive I can look in.
[02:19:43.583 --> 02:19:51.768]  And what I discovered is that the numbers in the 1918 pandemic are being inflated just like the numbers of COVID.
[02:19:52.208 --> 02:19:55.589]  And she said, you know, if you look at what happened, she couldn't add up.
[02:19:56.149 --> 02:19:58.429]  They gave county numbers, but they didn't all put them together.
[02:19:58.469 --> 02:20:09.631]  She tried to add them up and she said she figures there's about 100,000 at the most people, maybe up to 150,000, but not more than that, who died in the United States during the so-called great pandemic of 1919 or 1918.
[02:20:09.490 --> 02:20:16.031]   of 1919 or 1918. But by 1920, they'd already started reporting 500 million
[02:20:16.031 --> 02:20:20.870]   people or 500,000 people dead in the United States. And then it keeps going up.
[02:20:21.395 --> 02:20:31.123]  Recently the CDC told us 50 million people died worldwide and she looked at papers all in between there and all the numbers keep getting larger and larger.
[02:20:31.443 --> 02:20:34.466]  Well the disease didn't change in those years, so what's going on?
[02:20:34.566 --> 02:20:35.927]  It's the same propaganda.
[02:20:36.248 --> 02:21:05.181]   I'm going to tell you, I thought This idea that talking heads on the news this was a digital age problem when they all said the same things and we've all seen those those videos where they superimpose people talking together and then there was a German I remember a German TV announcer who died a month after he said this but he quit and said I'm tired of taking my talking points from the intelligence services and he didn't survive too long after that but nonetheless
[02:21:06.309 --> 02:21:21.334]  I thought it was all digital age, but I found right away when I started, I decided to take up what Kate's been doing, and I just, I got my news archive, I subscribed, and it turns out all these small town newspapers all over the United States were in the same boat by 1919.
[02:21:22.694 --> 02:21:32.017]  They were reporting on the great pandemic of 1918, and here's four newspapers, I'm just going to mention the names, but let me tell you, there were a lot of these.
[02:21:32.357 --> 02:21:33.217]  It wasn't just these four.
[02:21:33.457 --> 02:21:39.860]  The Bemidji Daily Pioneer, the Leadville Herald Democrat, the Ferdinand News, and the Iowa City Citizen.
[02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:40.720]  That one's caught my mind.
[02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:45.622]  What I noticed was all these articles are exactly the same.
[02:21:46.163 --> 02:21:52.246]  They're talking about the pandemic as if it's this horrible thing and they're going on about it, but it's all these articles are word for word.
[02:21:52.466 --> 02:21:53.947]  They weren't published on the same date.
[02:21:53.987 --> 02:21:59.070]  They're all about October or November of 1919, but they have word for word.
[02:21:59.110 --> 02:22:00.371]  Okay.
[02:22:01.312 --> 02:22:07.636]  Now, interestingly, in the age of Linotype, those articles had to be, you know, purposely printed by hand.
[02:22:07.676 --> 02:22:11.939]  So the Linotype operator made different typos in different papers, but they were all the same.
[02:22:12.620 --> 02:22:16.702]  But they were, and another telling thing is these were never front page stories.
[02:22:17.043 --> 02:22:25.569]  These articles were like next to the church news or the lingerie sales or whatever, you know, they were not front page news.
[02:22:26.425 --> 02:22:38.968]  Here's another point that, according to a 1920, I researched all sorts of things like historical data artifacts and archives and military archives and stuff.
[02:22:39.148 --> 02:22:46.670]  In 1920, the Harvard historical document showed that 5,000 people in Boston died in the pandemic of 1918, but it was the third largest city for death.
[02:22:47.210 --> 02:22:53.672]  Again, that number doesn't ring as a crisis of unmitigated proportion, right?
[02:22:56.093 --> 02:23:00.115]  Well, here's what I think, another thing that I've learned.
[02:23:00.175 --> 02:23:04.737]  So, I've started talking to people, and my grandparents lived through this, lived through the pandemic.
[02:23:04.797 --> 02:23:05.917]  They never once mentioned it.
[02:23:05.977 --> 02:23:11.699]  You see all these pictures, because pictures burn their way into your soul.
[02:23:12.099 --> 02:23:17.081]  But, you know, the truth of the matter is, and I would, anybody that has, came from an old family like mine.
[02:23:17.121 --> 02:23:20.143]  My grandfather, whose birthday actually was yesterday, was born in 1884.
[02:23:21.684 --> 02:23:25.246]  He was in his young, you know, adulthood during the pandemic.
[02:23:25.266 --> 02:23:29.368]  He and my great, or he and my grandmother, all my great aunts and uncles.
[02:23:29.648 --> 02:23:30.908]  My dad was 13.
[02:23:30.988 --> 02:23:34.490]  My dad had three doctorate degrees by the time he was an adult.
[02:23:34.870 --> 02:23:38.612]  But he never, and one of them was, he was a, but he ultimately became a country doctor.
[02:23:38.652 --> 02:23:40.753]  He went from teaching at Harvard to being a country doctor.
[02:23:40.773 --> 02:23:42.694]  He just decided to get out of this stuff.
[02:23:42.714 --> 02:23:47.456]  But he said, you know, he told, these guys told me stories about the family all over the place.
[02:23:47.576 --> 02:24:05.714]   Not one mention in my lifetime with them Ever of the 1918 pandemic so we're expected to believe it was this horrible thing that went across America that would you know universities closed down and all these bad things happen, but I'm going to tell you there's something not quite right about this so when we look at it.
[02:24:07.714 --> 02:24:10.136]  Well, the Spanish Flu, but it didn't start in Spain.
[02:24:10.316 --> 02:24:12.957]  It started in Fort Riley, Kansas.
[02:24:13.558 --> 02:24:26.586]  And in Fort Riley, Kansas, interestingly enough, the very first thing that happened, I think, I've gone back and looked again at the military archives here and the Kansas City Historical Society stuff.
[02:24:27.066 --> 02:24:31.589]  On May 25th of 1917, an Army medical school was established in Fort Riley.
[02:24:32.209 --> 02:24:41.578]  Now, I bring this up because shortly after that, about a month, three months after that, was there were 525 cases of typhoid fever that occurred in Kansas.
[02:24:42.419 --> 02:24:45.662]  And the response to that was to give vaccinations.
[02:24:45.722 --> 02:24:50.907]  The Kansas State Board of Health gave 9,000 free shots, they called them, right?
[02:24:52.935 --> 02:24:58.740]  Presumably, about the same time, the Navy and Army recruits at Fort Riley were also vaccinated.
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:05.345]  In fact, we know they were given vaccines because we have documents in scientific paper, which I'm going to get to in a minute.
[02:25:06.646 --> 02:25:15.728]   Well, interestingly, three months after this typhoid fever outbreak and these shots were given, We had an outbreak of meningitis.
[02:25:15.808 --> 02:25:22.554]  Now think about today, how one of the big side effects of the vaccine seemed to be neurologic problems.
[02:25:22.714 --> 02:25:36.926]  We're having, they're warning us about flaccid paralysis, Guillain-Barre, you know, the drooping face, the different nerve, single nerve problems that we're experiencing.
[02:25:38.347 --> 02:25:40.229]  So what's really going on?
[02:25:41.007 --> 02:25:42.087]  Is this really meningitis?
[02:25:42.127 --> 02:25:45.948]  So the question is, three months afterwards, they start having this meningitis.
[02:25:45.988 --> 02:25:53.810]  Now, I looked when in 2015, when we were, when the state of Iowa was going to institute and they did mandatory meningitis shots for the children.
[02:25:55.390 --> 02:26:03.012]  I tried to point out that I couldn't find a case of fatal meningitis in a school child going back decades, actually almost 80 years.
[02:26:03.032 --> 02:26:03.132]  Okay.
[02:26:06.309 --> 02:26:10.932]  But that the biggest, in fact, the biggest outbreak I could find had been in the 90s.
[02:26:10.952 --> 02:26:14.334]  There was an outbreak of meningitis among gay men in San Francisco.
[02:26:14.394 --> 02:26:16.395]  It was a big outbreak, nine cases.
[02:26:16.876 --> 02:26:20.058]  So when they talk about outbreaks, that's the numbers we normally are talking about.
[02:26:20.098 --> 02:26:20.758]  But guess what?
[02:26:21.198 --> 02:26:25.501]  In Fort Riley, this meningitis outbreak, the U.S.
[02:26:25.581 --> 02:26:28.143]  Navy and Army estimated 40%, 36 to 40% of their troops were affected.
[02:26:30.902 --> 02:26:33.444]  This is not a natural outbreak.
[02:26:33.784 --> 02:26:37.066]  So this is how this whole thing apparently started.
[02:26:37.426 --> 02:26:39.988]  And then what did they do to the troops and to the other people?
[02:26:40.488 --> 02:26:44.091]  They actually then vaccinated with meningitis vaccines.
[02:26:44.571 --> 02:26:45.491]  And they talk about it.
[02:26:45.511 --> 02:26:49.674]  We have all the historical society records of this.
[02:26:49.694 --> 02:26:50.855]  So this is not conjecture.
[02:26:51.613 --> 02:26:55.314]  Now, interestingly, the same names show up all over the place.
[02:26:55.874 --> 02:26:58.714]  There was a Dr. Frederick Gates who was involved in this.
[02:26:58.874 --> 02:27:00.455]  Dr. Gates was trained.
[02:27:01.075 --> 02:27:06.456]  He graduated from Yale and he won the Adam White Award, by the way, which Adam White was a skull and bones man.
[02:27:06.476 --> 02:27:12.817]  I don't know if Gates was, but Frederick Gates then went on to Johns Hopkins University and got his medical degree.
[02:27:12.857 --> 02:27:14.057]  Where do we hear Johns Hopkins?
[02:27:14.097 --> 02:27:19.578]  Again, we hear it in the event 201 and in this outbreak, they've been very central in doing research and things.
[02:27:20.058 --> 02:27:30.938]  And he goes off and his first job, after he volunteers for service in the World War I, is to be a physician consultant for the Rockefeller Institute.
[02:27:30.998 --> 02:27:32.241]  I'm telling you, you can't make this up!
[02:27:33.032 --> 02:27:36.514]  And he tells us how these vaccines were made.
[02:27:36.994 --> 02:27:45.499]  And he talks about giving these vaccines and how they literally did it by, they were made at the Rockefeller Institute and then they were reconstituted locally.
[02:27:45.619 --> 02:27:52.182]  And they gave these initial doses like by 250 or 500 million cocci.
[02:27:52.222 --> 02:27:57.685]  They'd figured out the cocci numbers and they kept upping it in the troops until they got to a certain size.
[02:27:57.705 --> 02:28:15.812]   And they said about half of those vaccinated Whose third injection were due after February 4th, 1918 were given a final injection of 4,000 million cocci on account of the occurrence of several fairly severe reactions from the larger dose among medical officers at Fort Riley.
[02:28:15.832 --> 02:28:19.413]  So they were having problems and they decided to back down a little bit.
[02:28:20.987 --> 02:28:24.028]  So, when we come back, I'm going to talk a little bit more about this.
[02:28:24.048 --> 02:28:33.274]  I think I have one thing to say, I can squeeze in here, that probably at the same time they were, like today, they're kind of targeting the Native Americans.
[02:28:33.514 --> 02:28:37.376]  And so, the Native Americans were also vaccinated.
[02:28:37.737 --> 02:28:53.477]   And one of the first things we saw after this vaccine rolled out from January and February There was a scarlet fever epidemic in Kansas affecting four counties and in March five students at a Native American school were affected.
[02:28:53.517 --> 02:28:54.800]  We'll talk about that when I get back.
[02:28:55.498 --> 02:29:02.459]  Thanks, this is the Alex Jones Show, and I'm guest hosting, I'm Dr. Lee Merritt, and I'm just telling you the story of the 1918 pandemic.
[02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:08.221]  And what I'm getting at is that this pandemic was not as advertised.
[02:29:08.401 --> 02:29:17.343]  It appears that it was vaccine related, that it was not as deadly, it was not all over the country, it was confined to cities and military institutes.
[02:29:17.723 --> 02:29:33.455]   I was just talking about the timeline, and right after they finished the vaccination in February and March, We started to see Native Americans coming down with this and there were five dead and 457 were affected in March with what they called streptogrip.
[02:29:34.076 --> 02:29:40.904]  It just kept going on until finally in October of 1918 we started seeing cases of influenza.
[02:29:41.838 --> 02:29:46.319]  And the interesting thing about this was they could not prove transmission.
[02:29:46.819 --> 02:29:50.380]  That's what I'm getting at here about the whole issue of viruses.
[02:29:50.520 --> 02:29:51.700]  Was this ever a virus?
[02:29:51.800 --> 02:29:53.501]  And if it wasn't, what was it?
[02:29:53.801 --> 02:29:54.601]  And what is it now?
[02:29:55.221 --> 02:30:00.942]  So unlike today, they did autopsies and they actually tried to prove transmission.
[02:30:01.282 --> 02:30:12.746]   And in Boston, they tried to prove transmission by putting well people at 118 volunteers, although they were probably in the military brig because They commuted their sentences after this.
[02:30:12.786 --> 02:30:13.747]  That was their reward.
[02:30:13.807 --> 02:30:15.748]  So volunteers may be an overstatement.
[02:30:16.188 --> 02:30:18.330]  But they were, they put their, these were young healthy people.
[02:30:18.370 --> 02:30:23.354]  They put their faces on the faces of the dying without touching them and just breathed in their exhalations.
[02:30:23.434 --> 02:30:24.855]  Not one person got sick.
[02:30:25.315 --> 02:30:35.842]  They didn't get sick when they were swabbed with the dying person's nose goo or their lung or their, they swabbed the dying person's throat and lungs or throat and nose and they put it into the well.
[02:30:35.942 --> 02:30:36.663]  They didn't get sick.
[02:30:37.103 --> 02:30:39.204]  They couldn't do anything to transfer this disease.
[02:30:39.304 --> 02:30:42.867]  Even horses were getting sick and they couldn't transfer it from one horse to another.
[02:30:43.207 --> 02:30:44.988]  Which raises this whole question.
[02:30:45.368 --> 02:30:49.931]  Are we dealing with an infectious agent or a toxin or something in the environment?
[02:30:50.623 --> 02:30:53.284]  Well, that brings us to what was in the environment.
[02:30:53.804 --> 02:30:55.185]  So what was in the environment?
[02:30:55.245 --> 02:31:00.007]  Well, it turns out that these young people were down there to learn to be telegram operators.
[02:31:00.807 --> 02:31:05.469]  It may come as a surprise to everybody, but we didn't really have influenza outbreaks every year.
[02:31:05.529 --> 02:31:10.871]  We didn't have a winter death season until we laid down the telegram lines in the 1850s.
[02:31:11.271 --> 02:31:13.892]  And after that, we started having these seasonal deaths.
[02:31:14.620 --> 02:31:33.352]  Now, it may sound crazy at first until we get to the point here, but the point is that we have multiple things going on, and the electrification of the ionosphere seems to be a disease-producing problem.
[02:31:33.992 --> 02:31:36.193]  Influenza simply means influence.
[02:31:37.614 --> 02:31:51.901]   Notice that right during the outbreak here of COVID, The CDC published a paper and it showed that neither masking, disinfecting your environment, or wearing gloves made a difference in the transmission of influenza.
[02:31:51.961 --> 02:31:52.721]  Why is that?
[02:31:52.801 --> 02:31:55.603]  Because maybe it's not a transmissible agent.
[02:31:56.183 --> 02:31:56.463]  Okay?
[02:31:56.763 --> 02:32:20.346]   But what we do know is that when Come all over the world at one time, in the age of wooden ships and iron men, the Navy would get it and they'd be out at sea and they hadn't seen anybody in weeks and yet they were all getting sick and the same thing was happening in ships all over and in countries all over the world in the in the 1700s and 1800s without
[02:32:24.216 --> 02:32:25.777]  An obvious cause, right?
[02:32:25.837 --> 02:32:26.877]  They're not talking to each other.
[02:32:26.897 --> 02:32:27.998]  They're not getting near each other.
[02:32:28.498 --> 02:32:30.679]  It's all over the world, simultaneous outbreak.
[02:32:30.719 --> 02:32:48.646]  Well, some very smart astronomers figured out that these outbreaks corresponded over the last 300 years with the Sun cycle, with electrification of our ionosphere that happens when there are sunspots and high sun flare activity.
[02:32:50.927 --> 02:33:04.180]   And so, One of the, and interestingly, one of the, one of the, by the way, one of the person's names that looked at this is a British guy named Hope Simpson, but there was a Canadian, they're Canadian, if you want to look these up, they're Canadian astronomers.
[02:33:05.341 --> 02:33:08.103]  Ken Tapping is a Canadian astronomer that looked this up.
[02:33:08.123 --> 02:33:08.944]  There's a bunch of stuff.
[02:33:08.964 --> 02:33:13.848]  Dr. Arthur Furstenberg's book, The Invisible Rainbow, goes through this in some detail.
[02:33:14.328 --> 02:33:38.710]   But the point is, is that Is that in the winter something happens to us every year now that was happening kind of like it was only during these outbreaks before and what's been happening and And this is why people people want to poopoo this idea of electromagnetic frequencies being damaging if you're if you're one of those people that thinks this is all nonsense I really recommend that you watch dr. Debra's
[02:33:40.437 --> 02:33:50.141]  lecture that she gave in Australia, in Melbourne, Australia years ago to a combined medical school and engineering school.
[02:33:50.821 --> 02:33:53.102]  And it's because this is a problem of both.
[02:33:53.622 --> 02:34:00.425]  And she shows the relationship that the idea that we don't have any data about electromagnetic frequency toxicity is wrong.
[02:34:00.565 --> 02:34:10.736]   As she pointed out, and I think she was once the physician with the EPA or something, she had a government position that Makes her the right candidate to say this.
[02:34:10.776 --> 02:34:24.900]  She said, I thought it was nonsense until I started looking at the data that they put out, or lack thereof, and I realized they were using the same arguments for this electromagnetic frequency toxicity that they were using for secondhand smoke and for cigarette smoking.
[02:34:25.709 --> 02:34:28.890]  And it really just is not right.
[02:34:29.090 --> 02:34:45.857]  So what she showed, for example, even in 2G and 3G phones, they had documented cases where women were wearing the phones inside their jog bra or whatever, and they had tumors that outlined the antenna of the phone.
[02:34:47.748 --> 02:35:00.016]  What were happening to people in the early 1800s, they were getting sick along railway lines, because the telegram lines were put along the railways, right?
[02:35:01.684 --> 02:35:07.707]  In the old days, at least, they used to teach medical students Cannon's Law of the Body.
[02:35:08.208 --> 02:35:12.430]  It's a law that says that the body responds to rate of change, not to absolutes.
[02:35:12.610 --> 02:35:22.396]  So, it's interesting that in 1918, the doctors reported it wasn't the scrawny kids from the city that were getting sick when they moved down to Fort Riley and started training on the telegraph.
[02:35:23.096 --> 02:35:24.917]  It was the big farm kids.
[02:35:25.157 --> 02:35:27.038]  They're the healthiest looking guys down there.
[02:35:27.298 --> 02:35:30.279]  But you see, they had come from an area that did not have electrification.
[02:35:30.679 --> 02:35:32.660]  So it's the sudden change.
[02:35:32.740 --> 02:35:34.220]  The sudden change is important.
[02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:39.122]  You can, to some degree, you can adapt.
[02:35:39.762 --> 02:35:46.085]  But now we're in a world where it's almost impossible to get away from the electromagnetic frequencies.
[02:35:46.545 --> 02:35:48.306]  And are we completely adapting?
[02:35:48.406 --> 02:35:49.647]  That is really the question.
[02:35:49.707 --> 02:36:06.115]   Now, I have a video I can't show yet, but we're hoping to get to it here soon, to show you how your mitochondria work and how it actually How this can happen, how the electromagnetic frequencies can damage our bodies.
[02:36:06.755 --> 02:36:15.622]  One of the things we noted are people, even in research like Alexander Graham Bell, Edison, people that were around all this electricity all the time started getting diabetes.
[02:36:17.143 --> 02:36:26.310]  Animals in this age that we're in now, where we keep adding electromagnetic frequencies, they're noticing in veterinary research that animals are becoming more obese.
[02:36:26.330 --> 02:36:31.034]  They're having more signs and symptoms of like pre-diabetic states.
[02:36:32.219 --> 02:36:39.022]  So, we need to start looking at being not so much at viruses, because that's not been so proven.
[02:36:39.042 --> 02:36:42.064]  We know that we can have diseases without them, even if they exist.
[02:36:42.444 --> 02:36:46.646]  I'm pretty sure that the pandemic of 1918 did not involve some infectious virus.
[02:36:46.886 --> 02:36:48.166]  They couldn't prove transmission.
[02:36:48.206 --> 02:36:48.887]  So what is it?
[02:36:49.347 --> 02:36:51.988]  Well, we need to be looking at the electromagnetic frequencies.
[02:36:52.668 --> 02:37:03.413]   Now, it turns out, and I I sent this little vignette, although the fact checkers say not true, not true, not true about Wuhan.
[02:37:04.013 --> 02:37:11.016]  Yes, because Woody Harrelson even said, hey, you know, this COVID is breaking out in places where the 5G just turned out.
[02:37:11.496 --> 02:37:14.958]  But Wuhan was a model city for 5G rollout.
[02:37:15.058 --> 02:37:19.400]  And when was it announced that it was underway and it was getting completed?
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:20.581]  It was October of 2019.
[02:37:22.318 --> 02:37:24.581]  This thing is in the city.
[02:37:24.981 --> 02:37:26.543]  That's what this is talking about.
[02:37:26.583 --> 02:37:28.645]  So we'll be back and talk about that in just a minute.
[02:37:29.186 --> 02:37:29.546]  All right.
[02:37:29.566 --> 02:37:31.128]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:31.228 --> 02:37:32.149]  I'm Dr. Lee Merritt.
[02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:36.494]  We're talking, I talked about the 1918 pandemic and that it wasn't a virus.
[02:37:37.115 --> 02:37:38.517]  It was a combination of things.
[02:37:39.638 --> 02:37:40.559]  Three things, actually.
[02:37:40.679 --> 02:37:53.567]   It was electromagnetic It was vaccines that were crude and first-time use in a war setting for our troops.
[02:37:53.948 --> 02:37:56.791]  And the third thing actually I didn't mention was a bad drug.
[02:37:56.851 --> 02:37:57.992]  Now we have remdesivir.
[02:37:58.052 --> 02:38:01.075]  Back then we had aspirin and Bayer Aspirin had lost its patent.
[02:38:03.247 --> 02:38:16.074]  And it had convinced all these doctors to give handfuls of aspirin to these sick kids and unfortunately it caused bleeding and that one of the things that was noted in the pathology was that they had bled and many of them had bled into their lungs.
[02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:42.860]  Even today, though, researchers going back in and looking at the autopsy findings, by the way, in the 1918 pandemic, there was a Chinese researcher, Sheng, I think his name was, and he looked at all these paraffin blocks, and at the end of the time, he said, we still don't know, there's not, using even modern genetic analysis, the DNA stuff that they're doing, he said, we can't show that this was due to a viral outbreak.
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:45.422]  We can't show that, we don't know what it was really caused.
[02:38:45.462 --> 02:38:51.625]   So, Again, we need to be looking at other things, and I think the first thing we need to be looking at is electromagnetic frequencies.
[02:38:51.645 --> 02:38:53.085]  A couple facts.
[02:38:53.165 --> 02:38:57.347]  Number one is that Wuhan rolled out 5G right before the outbreak.
[02:38:57.507 --> 02:38:59.308]  It really, and it put it into the hospitals.
[02:38:59.608 --> 02:39:06.532]  In fact, that hospital where Dr. Lee died, I believe, was one of the first hospitals that was completely, where the Wi-Fi was completely installed.
[02:39:06.552 --> 02:39:08.332]  And let's look at where else this thing broke out.
[02:39:08.693 --> 02:39:10.113]  It broke out in Lombardy, Italy.
[02:39:10.173 --> 02:39:11.254]  It broke out in New York.
[02:39:11.554 --> 02:39:14.447]   It broke out on cruise ships, which were early 5G.
[02:39:19.028 --> 02:39:20.469]  Again, it's not proof.
[02:39:20.769 --> 02:39:32.717]  It's just you have to ask yourself and I can tell you if this had been an airborne disease that they thought given the way it was trans, you know, it would the number of people involved that were suddenly becoming sick.
[02:39:32.777 --> 02:39:40.743]  I won't say transmission because they couldn't really even prove transmission completely what they could they tried to look at within houses lots of times.
[02:39:40.763 --> 02:39:44.565]  There would only be one person affected and the other person never got sick.
[02:39:44.805 --> 02:39:55.446]   But what they did show in China looking at 10 million traces, they couldn't find Or anybody, asymptomatic person, in a household with a sick person transmitted it to anybody.
[02:39:56.101 --> 02:39:57.742]  So there's something wrong with the whole picture.
[02:39:58.043 --> 02:40:03.527]  If it had really been transmissible with this kind of death rate initially breaking out in China, it would have been all over China.
[02:40:03.807 --> 02:40:04.687]  It would have been in Paris.
[02:40:04.727 --> 02:40:07.089]  It would have been in Philadelphia, but it wasn't.
[02:40:07.169 --> 02:40:11.552]  So it was confined to these areas where 5G rollout was known to have occurred.
[02:40:12.433 --> 02:40:14.234]  Again, not proof, but a question.
[02:40:14.274 --> 02:40:23.132]   Now, it's also interesting that there are only two industries that I'm aware of that are completely indemnified against any medical Problem.
[02:40:23.713 --> 02:40:25.716]  And that is the vaccine industry.
[02:40:25.916 --> 02:40:29.642]  If the vaccines are on the childhood panel, they're indemnified.
[02:40:30.243 --> 02:40:32.847]  And the second one is the telecommunications industry.
[02:40:32.887 --> 02:41:06.334]   You can sue the telecommunications industry for their You know the the the appearance okay if you think that it's an ugly eyesore by your house you can you can take them to court but you can't take them if you think it's killing your children you know if you're thinking it I also noticed that they put these 5g towers up all by schools right where I am they seem to all be by schools except in the rural areas so I don't know what to make of that well I think I do but it's something that we need to take seriously if this is a problem you have we are we on the local
[02:41:06.353 --> 02:41:12.013]   level are going to have to make sure that this stops. I know that Arthur
[02:41:12.013 --> 02:41:18.292]   Furstenberg has sent out a compendium of information and I'm going to try and
[02:41:18.292 --> 02:41:21.833]   make that available on my site for people that want to take this on in
[02:41:21.833 --> 02:41:26.474]   their counties. That's what we need is county action about getting rid of the
[02:41:26.474 --> 02:41:30.773]   the wavelength. Now there are other ways to deal with this and we're
[02:41:30.773 --> 02:41:34.974]   going to talk on the, I guess I'm going to be with Owen Schroer next, talking
[02:41:34.974 --> 02:41:38.313]  about what we can do to save ourselves physically.
[02:41:38.313 --> 02:41:39.313]  And...
[02:41:39.432 --> 02:41:41.794]  And there are lots of things to say about that.
[02:41:41.914 --> 02:41:47.398]  We'll try to get to that a little bit here, but mostly I think we're going to talk about that the next hour of treatments.
[02:41:47.458 --> 02:41:51.240]  But one of the things is electromagnetic frequency mitigation.
[02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:58.280]   You need to block x-rays, but you don't need to completely block electromagnetic frequency.
[02:41:58.280 --> 02:41:59.400]  And I'm going to--
[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:05.960]   I have a video that I wanted to show you about how the electromagnetic frequency actually
[02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:06.879]  damages the body.
[02:42:06.879 --> 02:42:10.600]  Just keep in mind, we are really holograms.
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:12.440]  We are really wavelength.
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:15.799]  Everything in existence, it's the E equals mc squared.
[02:42:15.799 --> 02:42:16.560]  It really is.
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:19.799]  Mass and energy are the same.
[02:42:19.799 --> 02:42:22.960]  We're wavelength and a projection.
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:32.359]   And so we have to have some interaction with all these wavelengths.
[02:42:31.074 --> 02:42:32.494]  I mean, it has to matter.
[02:42:32.514 --> 02:42:40.718]  I will tell you two interesting pieces of information from Luke Montagnier.
[02:42:41.759 --> 02:42:44.021]  And a Russian named Kozlochev.
[02:42:44.061 --> 02:42:56.668]  Now, Luc Montagnier showed, and he was the famous French researcher that did the studies on HIV, which he subsequently recanted, but still got the Nobel Prize, which must have given them some tight jaws.
[02:42:57.348 --> 02:43:02.431]  But Luc Montagnier showed that you could actually save the imprint of water.
[02:43:04.140 --> 02:43:10.220]   or of DNA in water, that you can put DNA in water, it leaves its electromagnetic signature,
[02:43:10.220 --> 02:43:15.341]   even when it's not there, you can gather that electromagnetic frequency
[02:43:15.341 --> 02:43:19.819]   and then you can restore DNA in another vial of water with the amino acids.
[02:43:19.819 --> 02:43:22.620]  So it's very interesting stuff that he did.
[02:43:22.620 --> 02:43:25.220]  Everybody working on that, by the way, got demonetized.
[02:43:25.125 --> 02:43:37.774]  They lost their funding and ended up... Jacques Benaviste was a French researcher just at about the same time, slightly prior to Luc Montagnier getting into this, and he ended up in a trailer in the back lot.
[02:43:37.854 --> 02:43:39.715]  So there's something they don't want us to know about this.
[02:43:40.776 --> 02:43:51.642]   But in the in the 30s, Kozlachev, a Russian, showed that you can You can project, there's something that comes off of cells that can project disease to other cells.
[02:43:52.603 --> 02:43:58.686]  And whatever the disease or damage is, the dying cell gives off what they call death photons that go to the other cells.
[02:43:58.746 --> 02:44:07.231]  Now let's just consider the possibility of being able to project disease using that technology, using this capture of wavelength.
[02:44:07.772 --> 02:44:10.313]  If we are wavelength, then it interacts with us.
[02:44:10.793 --> 02:44:15.076]  Your DNA is like a big antenna, and it's a helical structure.
[02:44:15.692 --> 02:44:18.914]  Your hair is a helical structure, meaning it looks like a spiral.
[02:44:20.054 --> 02:44:29.139]  5G was developed by DARPA and probably other military aspects, deep arts, but it was developed by DARPA as a denial of access program.
[02:44:29.799 --> 02:44:46.334]   If you look, they used it, I believe, in the Gulf War, and they called, I think they called them poppers, but basically you turned on the 5G emitter, And depending on how you turn up the gain and how you turn the frequency, it interacts with helical structures.
[02:44:47.094 --> 02:44:55.679]  So it interacts with your, the way it could clear an area of anybody standing there is it could, they could set it to interact with your hair follicle.
[02:44:55.720 --> 02:44:57.381]  That was the denial of access weapon.
[02:44:57.741 --> 02:45:02.304]  And when they turned it on, we've had some troops that accidentally got caught in the beam and they reported it.
[02:45:02.344 --> 02:45:03.144]  You can't stay there.
[02:45:03.484 --> 02:45:05.966]  It makes you feel like your whole body is on fire.
[02:45:06.730 --> 02:45:11.652]  Because the hair follicle is lit up.
[02:45:12.453 --> 02:45:18.175]  Now, I'm trying to think about what that thing is I'm looking at there.
[02:45:22.097 --> 02:45:29.020]  Anyway, the other thing though it can do, think about it, it can damage your DNA.
[02:45:29.060 --> 02:45:33.302]  We know that x-rays, we know that certain wavelengths, we know for sure damage DNA.
[02:45:34.443 --> 02:45:42.970]   Why are we not talking about what this wavelength 5G means 5th generation.
[02:45:43.010 --> 02:45:44.311]  It's not a particular wavelength.
[02:45:44.331 --> 02:45:52.533]  What they've done is opened up the entire wavelength spectrum available to the telecommunications industry now above 1 gigahertz.
[02:45:53.193 --> 02:45:54.233]  So these are microwaves.
[02:45:57.213 --> 02:46:02.637]  Why do they tell people with microwave ovens, if you have a pacemaker, don't get too close to it?
[02:46:03.218 --> 02:46:07.161]  Because they are not completely shielded.
[02:46:07.341 --> 02:46:17.550]  Microwaves don't travel as far as other waves, but they have toxicity to our tissues in multiple ways.
[02:46:20.771 --> 02:46:22.312]  We don't have the video.
[02:46:22.753 --> 02:46:36.466]  I tried to put it out, but I was going to show you how this works at the mitochondrial level and hopefully we'll just have... Okay, when we come back, we'll talk about that because every cell in your body has mitochondria.
[02:46:37.747 --> 02:46:46.011]   The mitochondria, and I think there are about 320,000 mitochondria per cell, And you have trillions of cells in your body.
[02:46:46.532 --> 02:46:51.799]  You have thousands, I think, I can't remember how many nanomotors.
[02:46:52.219 --> 02:46:54.442]  This is the way a power plant works.
[02:46:54.542 --> 02:46:56.144]  And it's the way your mitochondria work.
[02:46:56.164 --> 02:46:57.927]  And we're going to talk about that when I come back.
[02:46:59.992 --> 02:47:00.832]  It's the same method.
[02:47:01.313 --> 02:47:02.913]  It's all run on electricity.
[02:47:03.033 --> 02:47:05.034]  Your way of producing energy in the body.
[02:47:05.094 --> 02:47:06.174]  So hang on for that.
[02:47:06.214 --> 02:47:09.015]  We'll be back in just a couple minutes and we'll go over that.
[02:47:09.475 --> 02:47:10.275]  Alright, we're back.
[02:47:10.855 --> 02:47:11.936]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:11.996 --> 02:47:12.896]  I'm Dr. Lee Marat.
[02:47:13.296 --> 02:47:16.737]  And I was talking about how electromagnetic frequencies damage the body.
[02:47:16.757 --> 02:47:19.658]  And there are a couple effects, but let's start this video.
[02:47:19.698 --> 02:47:23.339]  And I'm going to show you the one that I think, I think there's a couple of them we need to talk about.
[02:47:23.379 --> 02:47:24.139]  This is a big one.
[02:47:24.980 --> 02:47:26.020]  It's how you make energy.
[02:47:27.145 --> 02:47:30.607]  Okay, now we normally make energy in the Grand Coulee Dam.
[02:47:30.647 --> 02:47:32.829]  It's made because water comes down under pressure.
[02:47:33.229 --> 02:47:35.990]  There's more water on top of the dam than on the bottom.
[02:47:36.050 --> 02:47:46.537]  Water comes down and it fills these little rotors, these little cups on these rotors, and then these spin around, and that is attached to a generator that then produces electricity.
[02:47:46.897 --> 02:47:51.940]  And believe it or not, in your body, we have actually the same principle.
[02:47:52.660 --> 02:47:53.281]  We'll give it a minute.
[02:47:53.301 --> 02:47:56.103]  Maybe I gave myself too long to explain that, but you've seen it.
[02:47:57.459 --> 02:47:59.284]  This is from Harvard University.
[02:47:59.424 --> 02:48:01.068]  It's actually the very best...
[02:48:03.058 --> 02:48:04.939]  picture of the mitochondria I've ever seen.
[02:48:04.999 --> 02:48:12.082]  So here's your cell, and in every cell in the human body, of which there's trillions, there are these little mitochondria.
[02:48:12.222 --> 02:48:15.404]  And the mitochondria are your little power plants within the cell.
[02:48:15.464 --> 02:48:19.126]  This is what they purportedly look like, although I don't think we completely know.
[02:48:19.486 --> 02:48:24.428]  And they have all these interior walls that are lined with what they call nano-motors.
[02:48:24.889 --> 02:48:29.311]  And they really work just like that generator I just showed you from Grand Coulee Dam.
[02:48:30.851 --> 02:48:33.833]  Every mitochondria has an inner and outer membrane.
[02:48:33.993 --> 02:48:36.454]  This is a lipid bilayer construct.
[02:48:36.494 --> 02:48:37.014]  There it is.
[02:48:37.615 --> 02:48:42.917]  And on one side of the lipids, you have a lot of protons, which are hydrogen ions.
[02:48:43.217 --> 02:48:45.018]  And on the other side, it's a lower amount.
[02:48:45.038 --> 02:48:45.759]  So you have a gradient.
[02:48:46.219 --> 02:48:46.759]  Now look at that.
[02:48:46.799 --> 02:48:52.562]  That literally is a schematic of the proteins that make up these nanomotors.
[02:48:52.682 --> 02:49:24.379]   And they turn around and they produce ATP which is the money that's the that's your that's your like gasoline that's your fuel in the body okay ATP so you've got all these protons going through this gradient and it's supported by these other proteins that are the support structure this is like your power plants on the right and all these complexes are your your mining your coal mine and the train that takes the coal to the power plant that's essentially what this is we call it the electron transport chain
[02:49:25.385 --> 02:49:27.047]  Now, why is this important?
[02:49:27.067 --> 02:49:30.409]  Because everything runs on electricity.
[02:49:30.489 --> 02:49:32.391]  It's an electron transport chain.
[02:49:32.831 --> 02:49:34.533]  It needs certain things to happen.
[02:49:34.573 --> 02:49:37.475]  Now, here you see these blue are the electrons.
[02:49:38.476 --> 02:49:46.796]   They're little electrons dropping down this transport chain and it's creating, these are redox centers,
[02:49:46.796 --> 02:49:50.516]   reduction oxidation centers, and they're taking a little bit of sugar
[02:49:50.516 --> 02:49:55.515]  and they're creating an electron gradient, okay?
[02:49:55.515 --> 02:50:00.275]   And what this does, there's a low affinity for the electrons at the top
[02:50:00.275 --> 02:50:01.835]  and a high affinity at the bottom.
[02:50:01.835 --> 02:50:03.835]  In other words, there's a gradient.
[02:50:03.835 --> 02:50:08.236]   And if you suddenly walk into an electromagnetic environment
[02:50:08.796 --> 02:50:14.275]   this is going to change the gradient on the outside that this has to work against.
[02:50:14.417 --> 02:50:16.638]  I mean, I think that's what's one of the problems that's going on.
[02:50:16.938 --> 02:50:25.521]  This is a very delicate system, and we know that in countries that have suddenly electrified, people are start getting diabetes.
[02:50:25.561 --> 02:50:27.702]  It's not because of the sugar dropping down.
[02:50:27.942 --> 02:50:31.944]  The sugar is still there, but now they can't process it because the gradient is screwed up.
[02:50:32.724 --> 02:50:38.707]  And this shows now this gradient produces energy that feeds the cell, feeds these protein complexes.
[02:50:39.127 --> 02:50:44.070]  But some of the electrons are what will become the power.
[02:50:44.090 --> 02:50:47.572]  That's what we're going to add for the power in the body.
[02:50:47.592 --> 02:50:49.873]  And so they're like the coal that gets moved forward.
[02:50:50.413 --> 02:50:58.179]  On these little, these things that look like purple teeth, think of these as the coal cars that are moving the substrate to the power plant, okay?
[02:50:58.399 --> 02:50:59.600]  It's coenzyme Q10.
[02:50:59.640 --> 02:51:10.929]  Now those of you who take statin drugs, I'm not telling you not to take a drug, I don't give medical advice, but what we know that what statin drugs do is they deplete the coenzyme Q10 in the basilar membrane of the mitochondria.
[02:51:11.370 --> 02:51:12.931]  That's the little purple teeth here.
[02:51:12.971 --> 02:51:16.853]   So if you don't have enough Coal cars, you can't get enough coal to the power plant.
[02:51:16.893 --> 02:51:25.796]  If you don't have enough coenzyme Q10, you can't get enough electrons in your electron transport chain to go to that little nanomotor and make your ATP.
[02:51:26.336 --> 02:51:28.016]  That's really what's going on here.
[02:51:29.297 --> 02:51:38.420]  We'll move, it'll tell us, and it'll show us here in a minute how it adds water, it adds oxygen, and you're at the end point.
[02:51:40.940 --> 02:51:42.801]  So this is the electron transport chain.
[02:51:45.579 --> 02:51:47.379]  This is the end complex.
[02:51:48.140 --> 02:51:49.100]  Now we're having water.
[02:51:51.300 --> 02:51:55.141]  Water contributes its... There we go.
[02:51:55.201 --> 02:51:58.081]  The oxygen and the water molecule combine.
[02:51:58.101 --> 02:52:02.522]  And without oxygen, all this thing falls apart.
[02:52:03.882 --> 02:52:06.963]  And this allows the electrons to be pumped to the gradient.
[02:52:06.782 --> 02:52:12.983]   So part of what does does this is that the we have to keep the gradient going to keep those rotors turning just like
[02:52:12.983 --> 02:52:15.262]   Grand Coulee Dam
[02:52:15.262 --> 02:52:27.542]   And then in yourself There's the electron transport chain, and you have you have
[02:52:27.542 --> 02:52:36.375]   gazillions of these things and they're always rotating Now, the final common pathway for disease is right there.
[02:52:36.735 --> 02:52:37.656]  It's in the mitochondria.
[02:52:37.676 --> 02:52:44.279]  The reason I went to the trouble of showing you that is it's not just EMF that can make you sick, it's anything that toxifies that system.
[02:52:45.199 --> 02:52:46.840]  So, you deplete the coenzyme Q10.
[02:52:49.796 --> 02:52:55.264]  You can damage your mitochondria by having too much byproducts of the reactions.
[02:52:55.324 --> 02:52:58.508]  In other words, you get a reactive oxygen species.
[02:52:58.548 --> 02:53:01.492]  You get basically think of your think of these things.
[02:53:01.532 --> 02:53:04.055]  I think of their little mitochondria like sawmills.
[02:53:04.396 --> 02:53:04.576]  Okay.
[02:53:05.036 --> 02:53:06.377]  You're going to produce boards.
[02:53:06.417 --> 02:53:07.939]  You're going to produce boards from lumber.
[02:53:08.279 --> 02:53:21.850]  But the problem is if you don't have somebody inside, if you're inefficient and you make a lot of sawdust more than you should because you've got dull blades or something, then you start creating more sawdust and you're not making as many boards.
[02:53:21.910 --> 02:53:23.531]  That's aging in your mitochondria.
[02:53:24.012 --> 02:53:27.535]  You start being less efficient because you start gumming up the works.
[02:53:27.615 --> 02:53:29.536]  Your mitochondria are not working as well.
[02:53:29.836 --> 02:53:31.378]  And there are multiple reasons for that.
[02:53:33.921 --> 02:53:42.971]  When we talk about solutions, we have to understand that it's not just about viruses, if they even exist, it's about toxins to the mitochondria.
[02:53:43.772 --> 02:53:46.475]  Ancient medicine looked at two things.
[02:53:47.556 --> 02:53:51.000]  There were two treatments, purification and detoxification.
[02:53:51.647 --> 02:53:55.134]  Okay, get right with God, purification and detoxification.
[02:53:55.154 --> 02:54:01.746]  They saw the world as filled with toxins and I think they're ultimately going to be proven right.
[02:54:02.688 --> 02:54:08.531]  It's interesting that when you look at older medical books, they deal with a couple things.
[02:54:08.671 --> 02:54:11.272]  They deal with parasites and they deal with toxins.
[02:54:11.872 --> 02:54:14.493]  This is where we should put some attention.
[02:54:15.454 --> 02:54:19.515]  One of the toxins is electromagnetic frequencies, and we've talked about that a little bit.
[02:54:19.696 --> 02:54:23.577]  Other toxins are the poisons in our water, our air, and our food.
[02:54:24.077 --> 02:54:25.858]  This is a big thing coming to us.
[02:54:26.579 --> 02:54:29.720]  And a huge toxin is what's in these vaccines.
[02:54:30.606 --> 02:54:38.909]  Provably now, I think, multiple laboratory people have shown that there is graphene oxide in these vaccines.
[02:54:39.509 --> 02:54:41.090]  Now what does graphene oxide do?
[02:54:41.390 --> 02:54:50.126]   Graphene is a huge electron It sucks up electrons.
[02:54:50.186 --> 02:54:51.887]  It steals electrons from things.
[02:54:51.947 --> 02:54:56.889]  It can do all sorts of things, but one of the things it does is steal electrons.
[02:54:57.390 --> 02:55:01.072]  Cationic lipids in the vaccines, they steal electrons.
[02:55:01.512 --> 02:55:02.252]  And what do we see?
[02:55:02.312 --> 02:55:06.314]  We see the result of that in clotting and in mitochondrial damage.
[02:55:07.475 --> 02:55:12.678]  We need to go back to basics and let's just think about how we can detoxify our mitochondria.
[02:55:13.328 --> 02:55:14.829]  And there are lots of different options.
[02:55:14.849 --> 02:55:17.171]  We'll be talking about those, I think, in the next segment.
[02:55:17.191 --> 02:55:18.953]  But there are lots of different things we can do.
[02:55:19.574 --> 02:55:21.936]  First of all, I tell people, stop poisoning yourself.
[02:55:21.996 --> 02:55:24.598]  Stop eating food that is toxic.
[02:55:25.639 --> 02:55:26.299]  Don't eat junk.
[02:55:26.399 --> 02:55:36.068]  Don't eat wheat-based products that have lots of chemicals in them, including glyphosate, including chemicals that open up your bowel, that damage your immune system.
[02:55:37.046 --> 02:55:38.427]  Don't eat artificial oils.
[02:55:38.667 --> 02:55:40.848]  It turns out artificial oils are damaging.
[02:55:40.908 --> 02:55:53.176]  The seed oils, the man-made oils, you know, what one of my favorite people, Jack LaLanne, he's dead now, but he died at 96, I believe, doing fingertip push-ups at 92.
[02:55:53.236 --> 02:55:54.837]  But what Jack LaLanne always said is true.
[02:55:55.597 --> 02:55:57.038]  If man made it, don't eat it.
[02:55:57.771 --> 02:56:04.117]  You know, we've been given things that look like food, we think are food, but they're not food.
[02:56:04.457 --> 02:56:08.140]  You know, if your great-grandmother couldn't recognize it as food, it's not food.
[02:56:08.181 --> 02:56:14.426]  Would your great-grandmother recognize a box, at least my great-grandmother, in the 1860s and 70s?
[02:56:14.506 --> 02:56:14.726]  No.
[02:56:15.787 --> 02:56:22.914]  If you saw a box of macaroni and cheese, instant macaroni and cheese, I don't think she would have recognized that as food.
[02:56:24.324 --> 02:56:25.525]  We have so many things like that.
[02:56:25.545 --> 02:56:28.567]  If it has a big ingredient list, think of those ingredients as toxins.
[02:56:29.627 --> 02:56:31.268]  Let's eat real food for real people.
[02:56:31.308 --> 02:56:32.649]  That's the Weston A. Price thing.
[02:56:33.369 --> 02:56:34.870]  And let's detoxify our body.
[02:56:34.930 --> 02:56:41.674]  Isn't it interesting too that the other thing that we've known in classic medicine was parasites and the five drugs that they don't want us to have.
[02:56:45.787 --> 02:57:00.619]  All the anti-parasitic drugs, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, ivermectin, nidazoxonide and chlorine dioxide, which is not a drug but is used extensively in industry and among missionaries to do all sorts of good things for the body.
[02:57:01.180 --> 02:57:04.523]   So detoxification, Taking out parasites.
[02:57:05.184 --> 02:57:06.685]  Let's refocus our energies.
[02:57:07.145 --> 02:57:11.369]  Let's think about these EMF towers because quite frankly, doctors can't solve this one.
[02:57:11.989 --> 02:57:13.931]  You at the local level have to solve this one.
[02:57:14.271 --> 02:57:16.053]  And we're going to get the information out there.
[02:57:16.633 --> 02:57:19.075]  And then you need to make use of it just like you are.
[02:57:19.816 --> 02:57:20.196]  I love it.
[02:57:20.236 --> 02:57:22.358]  Just like you are with the electoral process.
[02:57:22.678 --> 02:57:23.299]  County level.
[02:57:24.700 --> 02:57:28.000]  environment like we're taking back our electoral process.
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:31.140]  So I really appreciate being asked to come on.
[02:57:31.140 --> 02:57:35.100]   Might not be asked back, but anyway, I've had a great time and I hope this has been helpful.
[02:57:35.100 --> 02:57:37.240]  Thank you so much, hope to see you again.
[02:57:37.240 --> 02:57:38.080]  Be well.
[02:57:38.080 --> 02:57:50.140]   I've heard it thousands and thousands of times and I know you have as well.
[02:57:50.140 --> 02:57:53.719]  Why don't more people stand up for freedom?
[02:57:52.975 --> 02:57:55.959]  Why don't more people fight the globalists and their tyranny?
[02:57:56.640 --> 02:58:00.866]  And the answer is, when you fight them, they come after you.
[02:58:02.455 --> 02:58:04.717]  And the enemies of freedom have come after Infowars.
[02:58:04.757 --> 02:58:05.617]  They've come after us.
[02:58:05.917 --> 02:58:08.439]  They're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[02:58:08.719 --> 02:58:12.522]  And they're on national television saying we want to shut Alex Jones down.
[02:58:13.042 --> 02:58:15.444]  Because they see us as populist, which we are.
[02:58:15.844 --> 02:58:21.348]  They see us as the archetypal example of people that aren't bowing to them.
[02:58:22.128 --> 02:58:26.210]  I don't care if you're black, white, old, young or where you came from in America or anywhere else in the world.
[02:58:26.951 --> 02:58:39.798]  These globalists hate the general public and they hate men more than anything because men historically have been the ones during times of tyranny to rally to the evil and say no.
[02:58:40.816 --> 02:58:44.761]  And that's why they're coming after us with everything they've got.
[02:58:45.321 --> 02:58:47.664]  So when you ask, why doesn't somebody stand up against this evil?
[02:58:48.205 --> 02:58:50.688]  The answer is because most people don't want to take the attacks.
[02:58:51.409 --> 02:58:57.396]  But now it's become clear that submitting to the attacks is way more dangerous and way more sickening.
[02:58:58.683 --> 02:58:59.684]  Than fighting them.
[02:59:00.445 --> 02:59:04.609]  Going along with slavery, especially during the endgame, is worse than death.
[02:59:05.490 --> 02:59:11.716]  It was Zapata, the great Mexican revolutionary, that said it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees as slaves.
[02:59:12.076 --> 02:59:13.057]  But I want to go one further.
[02:59:13.637 --> 02:59:15.599]  You actually die on your knees.
[02:59:16.620 --> 02:59:17.901]  You live on your feet!
[02:59:18.872 --> 02:59:23.757]  I'm not fighting these people because it's some lost cause and it's just the right thing to do.
[02:59:23.957 --> 02:59:25.219]  I'd do that if it was the case.
[02:59:25.859 --> 02:59:32.045]  I'd do it because I believe in you and I know we can beat these people, but I need you to believe in yourself.
[02:59:32.746 --> 02:59:49.375]   So at this critical juncture, while the enemies of humanity are doing everything they can to try to silence you and your family, It is more important than ever that you spread the word about InfoWars and about the reports and the guests we have because they fear us for a good reason.
[02:59:49.435 --> 02:59:51.377]  We've got their number and we know how to beat them.
[02:59:52.438 --> 02:59:56.381]  Separately, we try to sell the best products we can because we want them to work.
[02:59:56.401 --> 02:59:57.221]  We want you to love them.
[02:59:57.241 --> 02:59:58.402]  We want you to come back and get them.
[02:59:58.663 --> 03:00:00.584]  They took our sponsors away more than a decade ago.
[03:00:01.265 --> 03:00:07.629]  And our flagship product that has funded so much of the great work we've done together, thanks to your support, is DNA Force Plus.
[03:00:08.510 --> 03:00:11.072]  It's got PQQ, CoQ10.
[03:00:11.572 --> 03:00:21.220]  It's got so many incredible products that you should go read about and discover for yourself that do amazing things for your body and your immune system and your DNA.
[03:00:22.461 --> 03:00:27.882]  It's finally in stock, and InfoWars is right on the edge of being in the red and the black during a bankruptcy.
[03:00:27.902 --> 03:00:35.204]  But if you support us and support the investment you've made over the years, you have my pledge that we'll never give in, we'll never surrender, but we could give out.
