[00:00.000 --> 00:24.000]  Info wars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:24.000 --> 00:32.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am back in the saddle in the ATX, it is Friday.
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.000]  April 8th, the year is 2022 and I think the crew are doing a great job.
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.000]  While I was in Connecticut for three days being deposed, or they're total four days,
[00:42.000 --> 00:47.000]  but being deposed two days back yesterday, afternoon our flight got a little bit late
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  so I wasn't able to do the broadcast, but Harrison Smith did a really excellent job.
[00:51.000 --> 01:00.000]  You know, I tend to get up here when I'm exhausted particularly and just start getting very loud and bombastic.
[01:00.000 --> 01:09.000]  That's really a coping strategy I have when I'm exhausted and I am also very frustrated with everything that's happening and unfolding.
[01:09.000 --> 01:16.000]  As they say, ignorance is bliss and the beginning of knowledge comes with great sorrow.
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.000]  One is the 20th century antidote, the other is out of the holy Bible.
[01:21.000 --> 01:29.000]  Ignorance is bliss and the beginning of knowledge comes with great sorrow.
[01:29.000 --> 01:40.000]  But also with great knowledge comes great compassion and decency and civilization and everything we need to move into the future.
[01:40.000 --> 01:47.000]  And I can see God's hand and God's work and everything we face and everything we see unfolding,
[01:47.000 --> 01:54.000]  but the madness and the insanity of the satanic left is just unspinkably obvious now
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.000]  and their open attack on children's innocence and their very bodies,
[01:58.000 --> 02:13.000]  deadly injections and gender-bending drugs and brainwashing is just the beginning of what they have planned for our little ones.
[02:13.000 --> 02:17.000]  So those of us that stand up for the little ones, they're going to be attacked, we're going to be demonized,
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.000]  we're going to be shot, we're going to be killed, we're going to be imprisoned, we're going to be tortured,
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  a lot of things are going to happen to a lot of us, but at the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:27.000 --> 02:35.000]  God is watching and God is in control and those evildoers carrying these wicked deeds out will pay.
[02:35.000 --> 02:40.000]  In fact, the crew found one of the great knowledge, comes great sorrow, quotes, there's four or five of the Bible,
[02:40.000 --> 02:56.000]  but please he asked, he's 118 is for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increases knowledge increases sorrow.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  Or you can boil that down to ignorance is bliss.
[03:00.000 --> 03:08.000]  I have much knowledge and I have much sorrow.
[03:08.000 --> 03:15.000]  Much sorrow for the hundreds of millions of innocent people starving to death right now.
[03:15.000 --> 03:23.000]  We go to our football games and watch our sitcoms
[03:23.000 --> 03:29.000]  and then people that are living in pockets still of western freedom, western wealth,
[03:29.000 --> 03:36.000]  just go about their business playing golf and tennis and having fun and going to movies
[03:36.000 --> 03:47.000]  as the water rises for those final islands of safety and security will finally be engulfed.
[03:47.000 --> 03:53.000]  But ignorance is bliss, right?
[03:53.000 --> 04:00.000]  And with much knowledge comes great sorrow, but also with the beginning of knowledge comes great sorrow.
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  Those are both Bible quotes.
[04:05.000 --> 04:13.000]  But we are about to see the world we've known destroyed and on its ashes built
[04:13.000 --> 04:22.000]  a system designed to destroy the human that's made the image of God.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  It's a very sad thing.
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  It's a very painful thing to see the spirit of evil spreading its black wings over the earth
[04:30.000 --> 04:37.000]  and sinking its long stinking fangs in our children's very souls.
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  But that is the price of consciousness and free will for good is not the only thing in the universe.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  Evil dwells there as well.
[04:45.000 --> 04:51.000]  And it is when those good spirits do not stand up and fight for innocence that innocence is destroyed
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.000]  and the blood of the children is on our hands.
[04:55.000 --> 05:11.000]  We're right back.
[05:26.000 --> 05:35.000]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty Tree coin.
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  It is powerful.

[05:45.000 --> 05:51.000]  that we're set to launch in the very near future thanks to your support of this project.

[05:55.000 --> 06:24.000]  and also gives you a real piece of history at 1776coin.com.
[06:26.000 --> 06:34.000]  At the end of the archetypal Star Wars Episode 3 before it was Disney-fied, Yoda says,
[06:34.000 --> 06:39.000]  failed have I and failed we have.
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.000]  Now the real pain starts.
[06:42.000 --> 06:47.000]  Now the new old order is going to kill billions of people including a lot of us
[06:47.000 --> 06:52.000]  and target our children for slow chemical biological annihilation.
[06:52.000 --> 06:56.000]  These demons like to take their time with the children.
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.000]  Failed have I.
[07:01.000 --> 07:06.000]  But the seeds have implanted.
[07:06.000 --> 07:08.000]  Now we've gone to the first act and to the second act.
[07:08.000 --> 07:11.000]  We'll have great victory in the third act.
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.000]  But when Jesus was at the Garden of Gethsemane,
[07:14.000 --> 07:20.000]  it was omnipresent but still in the body of a human,
[07:20.000 --> 07:26.000]  feeling all of it, tasting it all, smelling it all, seeing it all.
[07:26.000 --> 07:32.000]  He wept and said, please take this cup from me.
[07:32.000 --> 07:35.000]  The cup was not taken away.
[07:35.000 --> 07:43.000]  Because only by going in, through and beyond we find our true place in God's pantheon.
[07:43.000 --> 07:48.000]  Only by this test and you will all be tested just as Christ was.
[07:48.000 --> 07:54.000]  You are not Christ but you are a sub-art type and that's why Satan hates you.
[07:54.000 --> 08:01.000]  Your soul is so beautiful and its potential so powerful
[08:01.000 --> 08:07.000]  that these demons rage with envy at your glory and your might.
[08:07.000 --> 08:16.000]  Because a spark of the Creator fell and kindled and created what you are in your mother's womb.
[08:16.000 --> 08:23.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this April 8, 2022 transmission.
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.000]  And I can tell you that we forecast things here and we talk about a lot of things here that come true
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  and we wish they wouldn't.
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  We forecast them hopefully so people understand what's happening
[08:36.000 --> 08:41.000]  and see it before it happens so we can either completely stop it or mitigate it.
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.000]  But the spirit of evil that is running rampant on this planet right now
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  is going to burn, burn, burn like an out of control wildfire.
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  And already is.
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.000]  So let me stop pontificating and actually get into the news we've got here.
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  Pretty amazing.
[09:00.000 --> 09:05.000]  NBC News came out with a big report saying yes, we lie to the public on purposes for your own good.
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.000]  The Pentagon came out and said we lie to the public on purposes for their own good.
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.000]  Here's the M4's article about it, but here's the actual NBC story.
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  And that's really the last phase of lying, isn't it?
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.000]  Where they lie and try to cover it up, then deny it, then attack people that are pointing it out.
[09:22.000 --> 09:27.000]  And finally, just go, yeah, we're lying to you for your own good.
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.000]  And we're censoring you for your own good.
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  Yeah, it's all for our own good, isn't it?
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.000]  Just a few decades ago, it was maybe one woman a year had her breasts removed
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  because she thought she was a man mutilating herself.
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  Now it's hundreds of thousands of women a year have their breasts cut off.
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.000]  So I'm as young as 12 years old.
[09:49.000 --> 09:55.000]  After all, Angelina Jolie made it so cool.
[09:55.000 --> 10:00.000]  And Megan Kelly laughs about how her third grade son, they tried to turn him into a transgender.
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  But it's not a laughing matter.
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  It's not like it's some kooky side French thing.
[10:05.000 --> 10:11.000]  This is the biological takeover of our civilization by the technocrats.
[10:11.000 --> 10:18.000]  This is some weird thing that was hatched on university campuses by weirdos 30 years ago, 40 years ago.
[10:18.000 --> 10:24.000]  It was developed and prepared for the moment we're at now.
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  There's that stack.
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.000]  We have the big Russia stack breaking Russia suspended from UN Human Rights Council.
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  We're getting that.
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  We have this report out.
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  Western Journal has it as big polls.
[10:37.000 --> 10:45.000]  17% of Biden voters would have abandoned him if they knew about the stories covered and censored by the media,
[10:45.000 --> 10:54.000]  like the Hunter Biden Pito laptop, which is him talking about the head of Chinese intelligence,
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  the one that controls me and my dad, and he's worth $57 billion and we have $3 billion or whatever it is,
[11:00.000 --> 11:03.000]  and it's missing and he's disappeared.
[11:03.000 --> 11:05.000]  My handler at China has been arrested.
[11:05.000 --> 11:12.000]  What am I going to do?
[11:12.000 --> 11:18.000]  I mean, that's where we are in a country where they'll arrest people and try to give them 10 years in prison
[11:18.000 --> 11:24.000]  or when the cops wave them in, the majority of folks, into the capital and they're walking between velvet ropes.
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.000]  They don't know an hour before people did break in and the police stood down.
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.000]  They don't know.
[11:31.000 --> 11:36.000]  But they still get to sit in solitary confinement for a year.
[11:36.000 --> 11:44.000]  Finally, a judge acquitted on all charges, a January 6th protestor,
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  who was on the tail end of folks that went and didn't know.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  There's video of it all.
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.000]  The government's still trying to suppress it, but he was able to get it via the trial.
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  The evidence was put on.
[11:55.000 --> 12:01.000]  He chose the judges of a jury and the judge said, yeah, he polite the whole time, never attacked anybody.
[12:01.000 --> 12:06.000]  He didn't know he was waved in, but he didn't know that he shouldn't have gone in.
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.000]  But just remember that that's the type of stuff that's going on and you can laugh at January 6th and say,
[12:11.000 --> 12:18.000]  oh, my gosh, they overblow it. They make a big deal about it. Can we just move on? It's not about January 6th.
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  It was still a terrible fiasco and I wish never would have happened.
[12:21.000 --> 12:29.000]  It's about the fact that they're branding all Americans or populists or conservatives or nationalists as terrorists officially
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.000]  and have moved on to the PTA meetings and the school boards.
[12:33.000 --> 12:38.000]  I mean, this is really, really happening.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  And there's a stack of articles here today, New York Times, London Guardian, where it says,
[12:42.000 --> 12:54.000]  the investigation has moved on to Ali Alexander and Alex Jones.
[12:54.000 --> 13:02.000]  It says we're the main focus of the investigation by the Jan 6th committee and by the Justice Department.
[13:02.000 --> 13:08.000]  And of course, I told you that last week, didn't I? And I'm not going to get into it now at this point,
[13:08.000 --> 13:14.000]  but it's just ridiculous. We want to talk to you about, you know, were you involved in this?
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.000]  Yeah, and I'm involved in going out and putting gasoline on myself and lighting myself on fire
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  or putting a shotgun up to my foot and blowing my foot off.
[13:21.000 --> 13:27.000]  No, I'm not involved in the fiasco of the idiots that went in there because they thought Q was commanding them to
[13:27.000 --> 13:33.000]  and there were some provocateurs and they had half the cops there they were supposed to and they blocked Trump's National Guard.
[13:33.000 --> 13:38.000]  We were set up by the institutions that were supposed to be protecting that Capitol
[13:38.000 --> 13:45.000]  so they could let a few misguided morons led by Q brainwashing break into the Capitol
[13:45.000 --> 13:51.000]  so that then the entire million people out there protesting for a 10-day investigation in the Senate
[13:51.000 --> 13:58.000]  could be demonized and they could attempt the outlaw of dissent in this country which they're now officially doing.
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  I saw in the news two weeks ago that all these prosecutors were stepping down or resigning,
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.000]  refusing to quote do what they've been asked to do to go after First Amendment activity.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  But see, now they have the people that will do it.
[14:11.000 --> 14:21.000]  Oh, yes sir, Mr. Garland, yes sir, Mr. Biden, we will go after people for their First Amendment now.
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.000]  I mean, you're not going to just get put in Twitter jail or get banned on YouTube now.
[14:25.000 --> 14:32.000]  Oh no, no, no, no, no, you're going to be on the inside of a federal prison.
[14:32.000 --> 14:35.000]  And people are like, whoa, we better back off and not criticize this.
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  Well, then you all end up in a prison.
[14:37.000 --> 14:43.000]  Remember what they said in a bug's life when the grasshoppers are making the ants gather all this food up form as they're lazy
[14:43.000 --> 14:49.000]  and the other grasshoppers say to the head grasshopper, why'd you just attack and beat up that one little ant
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  who didn't follow your orders? You're just ignoring him.
[14:52.000 --> 14:58.000]  And he goes, because if you let one ant stand up, they might all stand up.
[14:58.000 --> 15:06.000]  And there goes our way of life, being able to do whatever the sick, globalist demons want to be able to do to us.
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.000]  Yeah, there's the scene right there. In fact, try to queue it up next segment if we can.
[15:11.000 --> 15:16.000]  So here's the deal. I've said this a hundred times, I'll say it again.
[15:16.000 --> 15:22.000]  This was just some boss hog government that wanted a big, popular, powerful country.
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.000]  And they were skimming something off the top.
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.000]  I wouldn't be even fighting with these people. I'd be like, that's not good. You shouldn't do that.
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  But I'm not going to go up against boss hog when all he's doing is boss hogging.
[15:33.000 --> 15:38.000]  But when people are cutting little girls' breasts off and little boys' penis is off,
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.000]  and it's all over the news, they should do it. Man, we're in a frickin' cult.
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  And I went out of it. And I'm not going along with it because this is satanic.
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.000]  If you don't oppose this, you might as well get on your knees to Satan
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  and sign your name in blood in the book of death.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  Not me. I want mine written in the book of life.
[15:57.000 --> 16:04.000]  Bye-bye.
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  It is so historic.
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  And it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty being refreshed
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  with the blood of Patriots and Tyrants and more.
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com.
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  It's also at infoworkstore.com. It's amazing.
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  There's only 10,000 of them.
[16:46.000 --> 16:49.000]  And as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air,
[16:49.000 --> 16:54.000]  we're planning something very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.
[16:54.000 --> 16:59.000]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[16:59.000 --> 17:03.000]  You know, it's a fact, and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true,
[17:03.000 --> 17:08.000]  that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty,
[17:08.000 --> 17:16.000]  as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[17:16.000 --> 17:23.000]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[17:23.000 --> 17:30.000]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them, at infowars.com.
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.000]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you.
[17:33.000 --> 17:38.000]  And so now we need to support more than ever because this fight has intensified.
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  Don't need me to tell you that at infowars.com.
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.000]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[17:45.000 --> 17:48.000]  Things have been sold out for a long time, like info wars life,
[17:48.000 --> 17:54.000]  fizzy magnesium mix that's so amazing, and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[17:54.000 --> 17:59.000]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at infowars.com right now.
[17:59.000 --> 18:04.000]  The newest product from infowars life is now available exclusively at infowars.com.

[18:10.000 --> 18:14.000]  your immune system, while at the same time, funding the info war.
[18:14.000 --> 18:18.000]  Our immune systems have always been critical, but in this globalist era,
[18:18.000 --> 18:23.000]  with all the criminal activity they're involved in, it is more important than ever to take the tools God gave us

[20:17.000 --> 20:23.000]  One person is allowed to stand up and rally the people that triggers the power of populism
[20:23.000 --> 20:30.000]  and the programming God put in us to build good, decent, powerful, beautiful civilizations
[20:30.000 --> 20:33.000]  that will stretch to the cosmos and beyond.
[20:33.000 --> 20:36.000]  It's just this level of creation.
[20:36.000 --> 20:42.000]  That's why they fear you, standing up and being a true individual.
[20:42.000 --> 20:47.000]  There was that ant that stood up to me.
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  Yeah, but we can forget about him.
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.000]  Yeah, it was just one ant.
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  Ooh, one ant.
[20:53.000 --> 20:57.000]  You're right. It's just one ant.
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.000]  Yeah, boys, they're puny.
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  Hmm, puny?
[21:02.000 --> 21:07.000]  Say, let's pretend this rain is a puny little ant.
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.000]  Did that hurt?
[21:09.000 --> 21:10.000]  Nope.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  Are you kidding me?
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  How about this?
[21:27.000 --> 21:33.000]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[21:33.000 --> 21:38.000]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[21:38.000 --> 21:43.000]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  It's not about food.
[21:45.000 --> 21:48.000]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[21:48.000 --> 21:51.000]  That's why we're going back.
[21:51.000 --> 21:56.000]  Does anybody else want to stay?
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.000]  He's quite the motivational speaker, isn't he?
[22:00.000 --> 22:12.000]  Let's ride!
[22:12.000 --> 22:15.000]  Now, that's a children's movie.
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  This is the real world.
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.000]  Not some Hollywood fantasy.
[22:20.000 --> 22:23.000]  Of course, you should Hollywood had some decent messages in it like that,
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  because those are popular to what people want.
[22:25.000 --> 22:28.000]  But notice, over time, it's all been taken out.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  You can go see basically anything now.
[22:30.000 --> 22:35.000]  It's just pure satanic garbage.
[22:35.000 --> 22:44.000]  Let's talk about this right now, because this is a big, big deal.
[22:44.000 --> 22:45.000]  Oh, and the UN will tell you this.
[22:45.000 --> 22:46.000]  In fact, they come out and said it.
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  They're the ones running it and doing it.
[22:50.000 --> 22:57.000]  The entire planet Earth operates on the 90-day food supply.
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  Jack Purcell put an excellent link to a video laying that out.
[23:00.000 --> 23:09.000]  About 15% of the world's calories is that grain alone you see on screen.
[23:09.000 --> 23:13.000]  In fact, maybe we should play this.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  Let's go ahead and roll this now. Here it is.
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  15% of the world's calories come from wheat.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  About a third of that wheat comes from Russia, Ukraine.
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  Russia has banned export of wheat.
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.000]  The wheat spring planting season is like now, this week.
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.000]  And there's not a lot of planting going on.
[23:27.000 --> 23:31.000]  So not only is the current wheat supply in Russia, Ukraine blocked up
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  and cannot make its way to countries in Africa and elsewhere,
[23:34.000 --> 23:38.000]  but the future planting season is now significantly at risk.
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  And again, that's 15% of global calories.
[23:40.000 --> 23:46.000]  And just to take a step back, the whole planet Earth operates on a 90-day food supply.
[23:46.000 --> 23:49.000]  Once we stop making food, humans run out of food in 90 days.
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  And that's not just linearly across all nations.
[23:52.000 --> 23:55.000]  What happens is the most vulnerable nations lose their food supply first,
[23:55.000 --> 24:00.000]  and the richer nations buy that food supply to secure their population's calories.
[24:00.000 --> 24:05.000]  And so you very quickly see a bifurcation happen where suddenly famine is a real risk.
[24:05.000 --> 24:09.000]  And we already have about 800 million people on Earth
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.000]  that are subsisting on below 1,200 calories a day.
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.000]  So this very quickly tips the bucket in a significant way
[24:16.000 --> 24:19.000]  in a number of countries that's going to be really awful.
[24:19.000 --> 24:23.000]  And that's just on the wheat supply and wheat planting problem.
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  Perfectly said.
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  So you see 800 million.
[24:27.000 --> 24:31.000]  It's 270-something million they estimate the U.N. does
[24:31.000 --> 24:35.000]  that are about to starve to death in the next year and a half, two years.
[24:35.000 --> 24:40.000]  And it's very accurate because the U.N. runs the food distribution and the controls,
[24:40.000 --> 24:45.000]  even with the corporations, it creates a technocracy tracking system
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  so they can control it and turn it off when they want.
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  And then they'll have a photo op with some models flying by helicopter
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  and feed a few starving African kids that look like they're about to die,
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.000]  most of them do, get eaten by buzzards, by vultures.
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.000]  And then the supermodel gets back on the helicopter, flies back, gets on the jet leaves,
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  and they put it on TV, give us money, they're starving, they're dying.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  When the two-year lockdowns, because they did lockdowns in Africa for up to two years
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.000]  in many countries, because the IMF World Bank ordered it.
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.000]  Remember they had a Belarus show, the documents on air here in Avago,
[25:18.000 --> 25:21.000]  where they were going to give him billions of dollars if he just made everybody stay in,
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  except big companies, big multinational companies, they gave him a list
[25:25.000 --> 25:30.000]  that were in Belarus, they would all stay open, it was everybody else wouldn't.
[25:30.000 --> 25:35.000]  And he said, why would I take two, three billion dollars to steal hundreds of billions for my people?
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  No.
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.000]  But that's how this works, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:42.000 --> 25:48.000]  I think the National Geographic photographer took that famous photo of the vulture about to eat the dead black baby.
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.000]  I think they actually took that baby and actually gave him food and nursed him back to health.
[25:52.000 --> 25:55.000]  The answer is no.
[25:55.000 --> 26:01.000]  They used that baby to get you, to think the UN cares about you when the UN is set up
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.000]  by the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds to establish planetary government, planetary control
[26:06.000 --> 26:09.000]  over every facet of your life, and now we're here.
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  It ain't coming, you get a front row seat to Davos Group and UN meetings,
[26:13.000 --> 26:18.000]  where their top people say, you don't have free will, it's gone, we're going to get rid of 90% of you.
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  In fact, there won't be any humans by 2045.
[26:22.000 --> 26:31.000]  And I'm showing you documents, hey look, they say 90% depopulation by 2030.
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.000]  And you've got all the Democrats running around and leftists saying the world's all about to end in eight years.
[26:36.000 --> 26:46.000]  They don't mean the world for them, they mean for us, folks, like this little black baby that starved to death.
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  People always say, why don't they just move where the food is?
[26:48.000 --> 26:53.000]  It's always a war, it's always some mining company kicking them off that causes that.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  You're like, well, there are probably too many people.
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  Really, you're going to watch that vulture eat that baby?
[26:58.000 --> 27:04.000]  The point is, ladies and gentlemen, this is the real world, this right here, this right there.
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  Look at it, look at it, look at it.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  That's where humanity is on its knees.
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  And you know that little boy is praying to God right there.
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.000]  He's never been told about God, but he knows in his heart he's already about to die,
[27:15.000 --> 27:20.000]  his spirit is about to go to God, and he's there on his knees in 100 degree heat,
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  where the vulture that's about to eat his guts.
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.000]  And that's the new world order, that's the UN, that's Madeline Albright up there,
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.000]  who's burning in hell now, died two weeks ago in the media war, she's like, oh, she's a woman.
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  Oh, first secretary, she's a woman.
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.000]  Oh, it's like, oh, first black female member of the Supreme Court.
[27:41.000 --> 27:49.000]  Oh, so what if she's a pedo booster and anti-gun and everything, she's black.
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.000]  And Madeline Albright says, hey, what about 500,000 dead kids with your sanctions in Iraq?
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  Three times worse than George Herbert Walker Bushes, they were horrible.
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  And she said, yeah, it was a good price to pay.
[28:01.000 --> 28:07.000]  To see, that's her power, she's so powerful, but she's liberal.
[28:07.000 --> 28:14.000]  If I question a mass shooting, then I'm the worst man on earth, or Jesse Smollett,
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  or WMDs in Iraq.
[28:16.000 --> 28:22.000]  But if you killed Losie Stolls like your sanctions, you ran, killed 500,000 children,
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.000]  she goes, that's right. She goes, is that a good price to pay? Yeah, it's a good price.
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.000]  And they're like, oh, liberal.
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.000]  Oh, they're chopping millions of little boys' penises off every year,
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.000]  and hundreds of thousands of little girls' breasts, oh, liberal.
[28:39.000 --> 28:46.000]  It's almost as liberal as a vulture eating a black baby.
[28:46.000 --> 28:51.000]  And when the clock strikes midnight, which it's about to do, ladies and gentlemen,
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  all the evil you've seen is going to be visited on us.
[29:21.000 --> 29:26.000]  The last coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what we sold it.
[29:26.000 --> 29:29.000]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly.
[29:29.000 --> 29:33.000]  And I appreciate listeners getting over half of them now.
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  I'd like to move them out very quickly.
[29:35.000 --> 29:38.000]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days.
[29:38.000 --> 29:43.000]  And without the last coin sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  We would have had to lay off a lot of people and had some big problems.
[29:45.000 --> 29:49.000]  So as a limited edition, collectible, tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom,
[29:49.000 --> 29:52.000]  and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems.
[29:52.000 --> 29:59.000]  So please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the neural water at 1776coin.com.
[29:59.000 --> 30:08.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWarsStore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20-year history.
[30:08.000 --> 30:13.000]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding,
[30:13.000 --> 30:20.000]  supply chains have broken down, and InfoWars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for operations.
[30:20.000 --> 30:25.000]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making their main move.
[30:25.000 --> 30:28.000]  InfoWars, its paradoxical, is more popular than ever.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.000]  It is reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[30:31.000 --> 30:35.000]  But because of the cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure,
[30:35.000 --> 30:39.000]  pay for our own bandwidth, everything else, we are running out of money.
[30:39.000 --> 30:45.000]  So listen up to 75% off at InfoWarsStore.com on things like amazing Patriot t-shirts
[30:45.000 --> 30:48.000]  that help spread the word and fund the operation.
[30:48.000 --> 30:54.000]  On supplements, on books, on films, everything is 25-75% off right now.
[30:54.000 --> 30:57.000]  The biggest sell in our history at InfoWarsStore.com.
[30:57.000 --> 31:10.000]  Thank you for your support.
[31:27.000 --> 31:42.000]  InfoWars and Bandit Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide.
[31:42.000 --> 31:49.000]  But the expenses in Bandwits alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[31:49.000 --> 31:52.000]  So the biggest sale in InfoWars history is going right now.
[31:52.000 --> 31:59.000]  The mega-emergency blowout sale, up to 75% off, getting incredible products and keep InfoWars as strong as ever.
[32:22.000 --> 32:27.000]  We are announcing incredible tyranny. Everything we've talked about is now coming true.
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.000]  And the globalists want to take us off air.
[32:29.000 --> 32:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running the biggest sale in the history of InfoWars right now.
[32:35.000 --> 32:41.000]  In our 28 years, all InfoWars apparel is being sold at cost until the inventory is gone
[32:41.000 --> 32:46.000]  and we're never going to print these t-shirts and ball caps at InfoWars flags again.
[32:46.000 --> 32:49.000]  We may have t-shirts and apparel in the future, but I don't even know.
[32:49.000 --> 32:52.000]  We are blowing out of everything to get emergency funds in right now.
[32:52.000 --> 32:57.000]  I'm firing the bat signal and asking you to get your t-shirts at infowarsstore.com.
[32:57.000 --> 33:21.000]  Right now, they're at cost.
[33:21.000 --> 33:29.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:29.000 --> 33:32.000]  All right, no one opened the phones up in a day.
[33:32.000 --> 33:35.000]  Second and third hour, I cleared the decks.
[33:35.000 --> 33:41.000]  We have one guest popping in who got his leg really, really messed up or amputated after he took the shot.
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.000]  We're going to have to take a lot of calls here on this Friday edition.
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.000]  I'm very blessed and honored to be here.
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  Thank you for joining us.
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  I was talking about the UN keeping most of the money it collects to, quote,
[33:53.000 --> 33:57.000]  feed starving people while it actually puts the policies in with COVID,
[33:57.000 --> 34:01.000]  but also previous operations to cause the mass starvation and control
[34:01.000 --> 34:05.000]  and that the supermodels famously fly out, take their photos of the dead and dying children,
[34:05.000 --> 34:06.000]  and then fly out.
[34:06.000 --> 34:11.000]  But to clarify, I wasn't saying that the photographer in the famous photo itself
[34:11.000 --> 34:12.000]  actually didn't help the child.
[34:12.000 --> 34:17.000]  I'm saying in the aggregate that this is a well-known phenomenon.
[34:17.000 --> 34:24.000]  There's an article about it, the famous photographer who took his own life after taking this one photo
[34:24.000 --> 34:28.000]  of the little boy about to die, about to be eaten by the buzzer.
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.000]  So there you have that.
[34:31.000 --> 34:36.000]  I wanted to hit a few more of these articles dealing with the economy and then the cutting off of the food
[34:36.000 --> 34:44.000]  and how it's been the lockdowns that have caused the breakdown of society.
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.000]  It's been the lockdowns, not the pandemic that caused all the havoc.
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  There's a big Mises Institute article up on infowords.com.
[34:52.000 --> 34:53.000]  It's very important.
[34:53.000 --> 34:55.000]  I suggest you read and share.
[34:55.000 --> 34:56.000]  It lays that all out.
[34:56.000 --> 35:02.000]  So continuing inflation, what they're not telling you.
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.000]  The fact that it's every product and it's not going away and it's from the devaluation of currency,
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  it is, and the shutting down of infrastructure, it is in supply chain.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  It is not from Russia.
[35:13.000 --> 35:14.000]  And it was Russia's fault.
[35:14.000 --> 35:15.000]  Boy, that'd be great.
[35:15.000 --> 35:16.000]  That'd be easy to fix.
[35:16.000 --> 35:21.000]  Drill more oil, set up more energy systems here.
[35:21.000 --> 35:25.000]  But that's being shut down simultaneously by the same people that devalued the currencies.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  That's just a fact.
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  Big article on that actually in thefederalist.com.
[35:29.000 --> 35:36.000]  Biden admin prioritizes climate fantasies while famine threatens the world.
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  And it goes all through how, oh, oh, Biden's a cook.
[35:40.000 --> 35:41.000]  He's a nut.
[35:41.000 --> 35:46.000]  They're cutting down coal plants and shutting down gas plants and shutting down oil drilling
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.000]  and pipelines, which is killing and starving people and bankrupting people here.
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.000]  But it's just because he's a cook.
[35:51.000 --> 35:52.000]  He's a nut.
[35:52.000 --> 35:53.000]  He's stupid.
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  Why does he do that?
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.000]  Because it's a post-industrial world.
[35:59.000 --> 36:04.000]  But it's okay because look, you've got the one fake black lady up on screen with Biden,
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  who's Indian, nothing against Indian.
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  She's the first Indian vice president.
[36:08.000 --> 36:14.000]  And then you've got the black lady who is a pedo supporter and a total communist.
[36:14.000 --> 36:19.000]  But that's cool because she's authoritarian.
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.000]  You're supposed to just fall down and worship her.
[36:22.000 --> 36:27.000]  But nobody's supposed to go help the baby be eaten by the vulture or the baby black or white.
[36:27.000 --> 36:32.000]  Just in US court reinstates Biden's COVID-19 vaccine mandates for all federal employees.
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.000]  Told you that was coming.
[36:33.000 --> 36:34.000]  They're going to bring it all back.
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.000]  China's already done it.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  Destroying America to save it.
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  Biden's nihilistic destruction of the energy industry.
[36:41.000 --> 36:42.000]  Excellent article.
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  Again, I mentioned you should go read and see the facts for yourself.
[36:46.000 --> 36:53.000]  How the Fed made itself into the world's biggest savings and loan.
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  And it just goes on from there.
[36:55.000 --> 36:56.000]  Study.
[36:56.000 --> 37:02.000]  Americans will need to spend $5,200 more this year to live the exact same life.
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.000]  And that's just getting started.
[37:06.000 --> 37:11.000]  The media is ignoring these two events which could cause economic collapse, particularly the dollar.
[37:11.000 --> 37:17.000]  And that's the ruble going up and gold going up and being connected to those.
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.000]  And of course, the world reserve currency, they're pushing as well.
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.000]  And how that will affect the special drawing rights banking system.
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  It's a big deal.
[37:27.000 --> 37:28.000]  I abbreviated that.
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.000]  Just go read it for yourself.
[37:33.000 --> 37:40.000]  All right, I've got big news on the Pito front because they just had their Pito out in the open situation.
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.000]  That's that segment.
[37:41.000 --> 37:47.000]  I've got all over the world in the U.S. in blue cities, but also in Europe and other areas.
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.000]  People just have the book thrown at them that defend themselves.
[37:51.000 --> 37:52.000]  Oh, you've been robbed four times.
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.000]  Oh, they raped your wife.
[37:53.000 --> 37:54.000]  Oh, they got a knife.
[37:54.000 --> 37:55.000]  They're trying to stab you.
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  You defend yourself.
[37:56.000 --> 38:02.000]  Even with your fist, you go to jail and get a longer sentence than they get.
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  Macron says he is opposed to self-defense.
[38:05.000 --> 38:11.000]  That's a close quote after farmer shoots one of four burglars who broke into his home.
[38:11.000 --> 38:14.000]  You know, Tim Poole tweeted, gun rights are human rights.
[38:14.000 --> 38:15.000]  That's true.
[38:15.000 --> 38:24.000]  But self-defense is one of the most basic human rights there is any government or system telling you what's bad is the enemy.
[38:24.000 --> 38:27.000]  So that's coming up as well in more detail.
[38:27.000 --> 38:38.000]  And why don't the Democrats care that there was a town hall article last Monday, this last Monday, five days ago that I didn't get to when I was doing the show.
[38:38.000 --> 38:43.000]  But the headlines were it's like the Democrats are trying to implode themselves.
[38:43.000 --> 38:46.000]  It's like they're trying to destroy themselves.
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.000]  No, their mission is to destroy America and any free system.
[38:49.000 --> 38:56.000]  They're the demolition operatives in this economic, cultural, spiritual, biological, chemical war.
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.000]  So you look at them and you're like, why are they destroying their own country?
[38:59.000 --> 39:00.000]  Why are they hurting their own interests?
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.000]  Why, if they rule everything, why are they trying to make it all horrible?
[39:03.000 --> 39:11.000]  Because they want to get rid of people because they like to kill people because they're bad.
[39:11.000 --> 39:12.000]  You're like, well, that sounds really mean.
[39:12.000 --> 39:13.000]  Well, look at all the other countries.
[39:13.000 --> 39:18.000]  Look at all the other countries you read about you see in history and you actually witness yourself now happening here and around the world.
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.000]  That's what happens when good people do nothing like bad people getting charged.
[39:22.000 --> 39:35.000]  Speaking of that, there's a lot of disinfo articles and a lot of fake news out there saying that Info Wars is swimming in money and it's not true.
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.000]  Info Wars is maxed out. Info Wars does not want to have layoffs.
[39:40.000 --> 39:49.000]  I personally bought an expensive nice house knowing the market would go up four years ago, sold it for double, put it right back into the operation.
[39:49.000 --> 39:53.000]  That's what we do, ladies and gentlemen.
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.000]  And somebody running an operation like this and he's $20, $30 million in the bank.
[39:57.000 --> 40:03.000]  We've got a couple million in the bank, maximum, and that's for payroll and stuff out in the future.
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  I personally have exhausted my funds down to almost nothing, which is fine.
[40:07.000 --> 40:08.000]  I don't care. I got a decent car.
[40:08.000 --> 40:09.000]  This place I live now.
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  I don't care about all that.
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.000]  I'm really concerned about what's happening in the world, but we really need your support.
[40:14.000 --> 40:15.000]  Plus, we got great products.
[40:15.000 --> 40:23.000]  So it'll sell out by the end of the weekend. It is the part two of the founding member coins.
[40:23.000 --> 40:26.000]  The first was George Washington's Slayin' the Dragon.
[40:26.000 --> 40:31.000]  The second is the Tree of Liberty, Thomas Jefferson quote with also the skull on the back, beautiful coin.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  And we'll tell you what the third one is and that's it for founder coins.
[40:33.000 --> 40:34.000]  There'll be no more founder coins.
[40:34.000 --> 40:41.000]  And if we're able to continue on and operate, those that are founding members are going to get something very, a lot of things that are very, very special.
[40:41.000 --> 40:47.000]  So if you leave your email with us when you do that, I'm leaving it at that, but a lot of new stuff getting launched with some great people we're working with.
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  And it's just a gorgeous, gorgeous coin.
[40:49.000 --> 40:50.000]  The second one, the first one was amazing.
[40:50.000 --> 40:55.000]  I personally like this one even better than the first and it will sell out because I was out of town a little bit.
[40:55.000 --> 41:00.000]  So it would have sold out today, but it'll sell out probably by Saturday evening at current sales rates.
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.000]  So we want to get yours.
[41:01.000 --> 41:09.000]  We're going to hold back 250 for special deals and things in the future, but it'll officially sell out its main offering at the price it's being offered.
[41:09.000 --> 41:23.000]  And that will be sometime in the next 48 hours or so in full or store.com is a big banner at the top to link through to Patrick collectibles.com to get it or simply go to 1776 coin.com.
[41:23.000 --> 41:29.000]  And then finally, we're doing all this accounting and stuff to try to try to find where the money is and where is it.
[41:29.000 --> 41:34.000]  They keep telling me for years are like Alex, you're designing new t-shirts all the time, but you never really promote them.
[41:34.000 --> 41:42.000]  We've got 63,000 t-shirts and if we sold them where the profit would be a million dollars or more.
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  But if you just show them at cost, we'll bring in $500, $600,000.
[41:46.000 --> 41:47.000]  Okay, so they're all at cost.
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  So the shirt cost $5 is $5 and it costs $10 is $10.
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.000]  Some of them were designed and they cost 20 bucks or 20 bucks.
[41:55.000 --> 41:56.000]  They're all there.
[41:56.000 --> 41:57.000]  Rest Fauci shirts, you name it.
[41:57.000 --> 42:03.000]  And they're all in an edition because no matter which the oldest shirts we've had, the M4s in your face shirt or the mass murderers agree.
[42:03.000 --> 42:09.000]  Gun control work shirts or turning response team shirts or the Gadsden flag shirts.
[42:09.000 --> 42:13.000]  We'll have some new shirts limited in the future, but the cemetery's got to go.
[42:13.000 --> 42:16.000]  These shirts will never be remade again.
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.000]  All these classic shirts over 200 designs and a lot of them have already sold out.
[42:20.000 --> 42:24.000]  We were down to 41,000 shirts.
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  So great job everybody the last week.
[42:26.000 --> 42:32.000]  You bought more than 20,000 shirts and they're going to be all out in the world, triggering leftist and globalist and tyrants everywhere.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  They're really a piece of history.
[42:34.000 --> 42:35.000]  We need the funds now.
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.000]  So go to infowarstore.com or infowarstheese.com.
[42:38.000 --> 42:45.000]  It takes you right to the sub page of all the great t-shirts and all the apparel, ball caps, flags, all of it is at cost.
[42:45.000 --> 42:53.000]  Moulin Labe, the list goes on and on at infowarstore.com or triple A 253-3139.
[42:53.000 --> 42:54.000]  We'll be right back.
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  Please stay with us.
[42:59.000 --> 43:08.000]  In December of 2021, infowarst offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776 anti-tyrant coin.
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  And it's sold out in 10 days.
[43:10.000 --> 43:18.000]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin, a founding member coin, we would not be on air today.
[43:18.000 --> 43:26.000]  Now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin, is being offered and it will probably sell out in 10 days again.
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  It certainly needs to, the funder operation.
[43:28.000 --> 43:37.000]  It is so historic and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty being refreshed with the blood of Patriots and Tyrants and more.
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.000]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com.
[43:41.000 --> 43:43.000]  It's also at infowarstore.com.
[43:43.000 --> 43:44.000]  It's amazing.
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  There's only 10,000 of them.
[43:46.000 --> 43:54.000]  And as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air, we're planning something very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.
[43:54.000 --> 43:59.000]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.000]  Ultimate Bone Broth is back and better than ever.

[44:11.000 --> 44:14.000]  And it's now been reformulated as even stronger.
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.000]  It's Ultimate Bone Broth Plus.

[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  goji berry, alfalfa herb powder.
[44:25.000 --> 44:29.000]  Then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[44:29.000 --> 44:35.000]  It's got a real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[44:35.000 --> 44:37.000]  It even tastes better than last formula.

[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  Info wars and Bandot video have become a mothership
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide.
[46:42.000 --> 46:47.000]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter,
[46:47.000 --> 46:49.000]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.000]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now.
[46:52.000 --> 46:55.000]  The mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off,

[46:59.000 --> 47:04.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[47:04.000 --> 47:29.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:29.000 --> 47:54.000]  Freedom came my way one day.
[47:54.000 --> 47:59.000]  Getting the theme of this cutting your food off.
[47:59.000 --> 48:06.000]  If I'm guilty, I will pay.
[48:06.000 --> 48:11.000]  But I did not.
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[48:15.000 --> 48:21.000]  So look at the news today.
[48:21.000 --> 48:24.000]  All you see on corporate media is an obsession with putting
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.000]  experimental shots that don't protect your virus,
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  but destroy your immune system and give you blood clots
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  and all these other horrible things.
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  Obsessed foaming at the mouth, drooling to get them in children.
[48:34.000 --> 48:38.000]  And then drooling to talk to five and four year olds in public school
[48:38.000 --> 48:41.000]  and everywhere else about how they can be another gender
[48:41.000 --> 48:44.000]  and having the school market that this person has another gender
[48:44.000 --> 48:47.000]  so the state takes control of your child and screws them up
[48:47.000 --> 48:53.000]  and then has them later amputate their genitals.
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  I mean, that's what's going on.
[48:55.000 --> 49:00.000]  Then we have the new Supreme Court justice after Mitt Romney came in
[49:00.000 --> 49:05.000]  and supported her, what a cursed fat man is.
[49:05.000 --> 49:08.000]  And she literally, it's not like she just always gives
[49:08.000 --> 49:11.000]  below the minimum sentence the worst judge in the federal government
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.000]  for defending pedophiles, but baby rapers,
[49:15.000 --> 49:20.000]  he says child rape, torture,
[49:20.000 --> 49:26.000]  and apologizing to people
[49:26.000 --> 49:33.000]  that are going to jail for, in some cases, a couple of months.
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  And if you punched a cop in the face of January 6th,
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.000]  you're getting 20 years in jail.
[49:39.000 --> 49:42.000]  If you walked in there, didn't do anything violent,
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  you're getting, you know, a year in jail,
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  there's a guy that just got acquitted.
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  There's a cop's waving him in.
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.000]  But if you're sharing tens of thousands of images of children,
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  real children being tortured and raped,
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  or you even are part of it, you're going to serve a couple of years,
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  sometimes a couple of months.
[49:59.000 --> 50:03.000]  And man, I was reading her opinions and reading the transcripts.
[50:03.000 --> 50:06.000]  I mean, you're reading this stuff, you're like, this can't be real.
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  This cannot be real.
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  And then you go check the links and it's all real.
[50:10.000 --> 50:15.000]  This is just like, what world do we live in?
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.000]  What parallel universe?
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.000]  Well, I'll tell you, it's not a parallel universe of evil.
[50:22.000 --> 50:27.000]  It's a parallel universe where good people haven't stood up.
[50:27.000 --> 50:30.000]  So here's Jen Psaki.
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.000]  It says, gender-affirming health care for transgender kids
[50:34.000 --> 50:38.000]  is the best practice for potentially life-saving care.
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  That's what they're all saying.
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.000]  Oh, they might commit suicide if you don't chemically castrated them
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  or cut their genders off.
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  Think about that.
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  Transgenders have the highest level of suicide
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  and lowest life expectancy of anybody in the world
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  because they've been targeted by the globalists for extermination.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  Not because people are mean to them.
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  Not because they're not celebrated enough.
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.000]  That's the spiderweb of celebrating it to get people to do it.
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  And I'm on attack and some people have decided to do it
[51:02.000 --> 51:06.000]  or people that are doing it in a healthy way.
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  That's what they want to do and I put health in quotes.
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  That's their free will.
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.000]  Just stay away from the children.
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.000]  Socky, gender-affirming health care for transgender kids
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  is the best practice for potential life-saving.
[51:18.000 --> 51:23.000]  The White House has determined that gender-affirming care includes
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  social affirmation, worshiping it,
[51:25.000 --> 51:28.000]  puberty blockers, harm therapy, gender-affirming surgery,
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  cutting the genitals off.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  Let me show you some genitals being cut off.
[51:32.000 --> 51:35.000]  Now, here's a meme that says how women have changed over the years.
[51:35.000 --> 51:38.000]  1970s, you know, and in the 80s,
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  they started trimming their pubic hair.
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  By the 90s, they were all gone.
[51:42.000 --> 51:45.000]  Well, now in the year 2020, it's not a female anymore.
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  Women have a penis.
[51:47.000 --> 51:50.000]  No joke. This is real.
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  Don't miss gender in California.
[51:52.000 --> 51:56.000]  And here's two biological women who had their breasts removed
[51:56.000 --> 52:03.000]  and this poor lady even had her nipples removed.
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  They think they're men now.
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  Everyone has to celebrate it.
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  Look, you cut your breast off, not because you had breast cancer,
[52:09.000 --> 52:12.000]  but because you're a man. Yay!
[52:12.000 --> 52:16.000]  Whoo! You ran off the edge of a cliff.
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  It's so beautiful. It's so wonderful.
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  It's so magical.
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.000]  It's so magical.
[52:24.000 --> 52:28.000]  So dreamy, creamy.
[52:28.000 --> 52:32.000]  White House latest threats exposed to probability
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  that cannot stand.
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.000]  That's a perfect way of saying it.
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  Depravity that cannot stand.
[52:39.000 --> 52:42.000]  If you were in a coma for the last decade and suddenly woke up,
[52:42.000 --> 52:45.000]  there's likely nothing that could shock you more
[52:45.000 --> 52:48.000]  than how quickly radical transgender ideology
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  has overtaken society, because it's not radical.
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  It's establishment.
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  It's what the big banks corporations want.
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  It's a depopulation plan.
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  It's for transgenderism.
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  It's to get you ready for transhumanism.
[53:00.000 --> 53:03.000]  We're hearing arguments 2012 that children should only be able
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.000]  to choose their gender after the school tells them to
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  and manipulates them, but they have a civil right
[53:08.000 --> 53:11.000]  to physically mutilate themselves in response.
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  Yet that's exactly where we are.
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  They used to be chopped their finger off.
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  They put you in a mental institution.
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  Now you want your penis chopped off. It's good.
[53:19.000 --> 53:23.000]  As red states, as reported recently, calls for gender-affirming care
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.000]  have moved on from the fringe to firmly into mainstream
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  Democrat politics.
[53:29.000 --> 53:32.000]  And Republican governors and others have been vetoing bills
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  that would stop it. Just the targeting of children.
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  Hell, the governor of Florida just said, hey,
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  five to eight years old, don't talk to him about sex.
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  They're like, you want him to commit suicide?
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  You hate gay people.
[53:43.000 --> 53:47.000]  We're like, dude, if a mom or dad was talking to their child
[53:47.000 --> 53:51.000]  about this type of adult sex and things that children aren't doing,
[53:51.000 --> 53:55.000]  they'd be bad people.
[53:55.000 --> 53:58.000]  This is rampant. This is teachers. This is the school.
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  Think about the power grab here.
[54:00.000 --> 54:04.000]  But see, no one would expect something this outrageous,
[54:04.000 --> 54:08.000]  this over the top.
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  But that's who these people are.
[54:10.000 --> 54:14.000]  Rogan on trans NCAA champ swimmer, Leah Thomas,
[54:14.000 --> 54:18.000]  an assault on women's rights, women's sports.
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  Of course it is. You're a biological woman.
[54:20.000 --> 54:23.000]  You have different chromosomes. You are definitely a woman.
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  And because somebody else says they're a woman,
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.000]  you've got to accept them beating you at wrestling
[54:29.000 --> 54:34.000]  or swimming or sprinting or pole vaulting
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  or shock pudding.
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.000]  And now in most sports, it's men dominating it.
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.000]  So the men dominate the men's and then the ones that can't win
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  and men's, they go down and beat up the girls.
[54:45.000 --> 54:48.000]  The classic bully bit. Oh my gosh, he's a guy with long hair
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  talking in a lisp.
[54:50.000 --> 54:58.000]  Let's immediately bow down to him right now.
[54:58.000 --> 55:02.000]  President Macron says he is opposed to self-defense
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  as farmer shoots one of the burglars who broke into his home.
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  I'm going to get more into this next hour.
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  I'm going to give the number out. I'm going to take your calls.
[55:09.000 --> 55:13.000]  We also have big pushes by Elon Musk who I'm on the fence about.
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  He'll say five good things, then one horrible thing.
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.000]  He's pushing robot takeover, universal basic income.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  We'll talk about that next hour, how that ties together.
[55:21.000 --> 55:24.000]  And we're going to take your phone calls today,
[55:24.000 --> 55:27.000]  six after next hour.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.000]  We'll open the phones up.
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  We'll take your phone calls for the next hour
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.000]  and 54 minutes ahead of the next great guest host
[55:34.000 --> 55:40.000]  that takes over at 2 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[55:40.000 --> 55:45.000]  We have the latest on COVID lockdowns part three coming.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  I told you it was coming. It's all mainstream news now
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  and a lot more. But again, knowing is half the matter.
[55:49.000 --> 55:53.000]  We also have Brian Stelter had a disinformation summit
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  where he declares all other media, corporate media,
[55:55.000 --> 55:58.000]  evil and horrible that must be banned.
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  And they just got annihilated by the college students
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  that were like, hey, you guys said the Hunter Biden laptop
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  was a Russian disinfo.
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  You know it was real. Hey, you said that.
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  Yeah, you say that there's not two genders.
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  There's like 57 of them currently.
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  I mean, it's a joke.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  It's Humpty Dumpty with no viewers up there,
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  but he's going to tell you
[56:17.000 --> 56:20.000]  and he's going to run fact-checking groups for CNN
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  and Microsoft and Google and Twitter
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  that censor and control what everybody can see.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  Everybody can hear it is despicable.
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  And folks, info wars is the tip of the spear.
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  We are what the enemy hates the most.
[56:31.000 --> 56:35.000]  They know that we successfully, your help, us together,
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  ignited the current resistance.
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  And that's why we're the most targeted.
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  So I need your prayer now, please.
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  And I need your word of mouth to share the articles
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  and videos to override the censorship.
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  I need you to go to infowarstore.com, like I said earlier.
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  And all our t-shirts must go.
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  None of these designs will ever be made again.
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  Some of these designs we've been making 25 years.
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  Some we've been making a month.
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.000]  All of it's going to go from triple X large down to children small.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  It's all there.
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  Liberty or death, don't tread on me so much.
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  infowarstore.com.
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  I rest Fauci, limited edition, all of it.
[57:09.000 --> 57:10.000]  Believe me, you're going to need it
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  because they're going to try to lock down again.
[57:12.000 --> 57:18.000]  infowarstore.com, or triple A 253-3139er.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  And that will keep us on the air.
[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  Love that comment. Take it.
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  Church, she's wearing right to the great Christy Lee.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  infowarstore.com, or triple A 253-139.
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  There's nothing globalist hate more than us creating an economy,
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  an ecosystem of patriots that are self-funding.
[57:31.000 --> 57:34.000]  That pisses them off because that's getting ahead of their market
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  of the beast, which will try to control it.
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  Everybody does via this new system.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  Got a John Bowne report coming up,
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  and we're going to get to your phone call. Stay with us.
[57:49.000 --> 57:52.000]  We are only offering three coins in the series.
[57:52.000 --> 57:55.000]  The first coin was released in December of 2021
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  and sold out in 10 days.
[57:57.000 --> 58:01.000]  Now, the second coin, as we enter the last days of March
[58:01.000 --> 58:05.000]  into April, 2022, is now being offered.
[58:05.000 --> 58:08.000]  And I believe it will sell out in just a few days again
[58:08.000 --> 58:11.000]  because these are historic coins and because our amazing listeners
[58:11.000 --> 58:14.000]  want to support freedom and keep info wars at the front lines
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  of the fight against these tyrants.

[59:40.000 --> 59:42.000]  and keep info wars on the air.
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[59:44.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  Take action now infowarsstore.com.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  We now live in a world where the hidden 1,291 adverse effects
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  according to a Pfizer document are popping up everywhere.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  Taking the vaccine and the injuries caused by it basically
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  it's like a weapon, right?
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  So the virus itself was a pretty bad weapon to begin with
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  but what we need to realize is that the real weapon
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  is the bullet inside the gun, right?
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  So you can deliver the bullet in different ways
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  and the bullet is the spike protein.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  The virus was a pretty good gun to shoot the spike protein
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  into your body but the vaccine, the injections
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  are like a dirty bomb.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  We still won't face the truth.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  Whilst you've been distracted by Russia, Ukraine
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  the UK government quietly published data
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  confirming the triple vaccinated are just weeks away
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  from developing acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  We're not really certain how to treat this.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  We're kind of throwing the kitchen sink at it.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  We're throwing antiretrovirals at it.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  We're throwing interferon at it.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, antiparasitics
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  that are in study right now.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  We're trying to use everything that we can think of
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  to boost up the CD4, CD8 counts
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  and reverse this collapse, this calamity.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  The kill shot, the money ball, whatever you want to call it
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  it is just devastating to the immune system.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  If you look at the Stanford study, the spike protein
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  in the COVID-19 vaccines that everyone is talking about
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  is called the lentivirus.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  The lenti contains a combination of HIV
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  types 1 through 3, SRV slash 1
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  which is AIDS, MERS and SARS.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  In the Stanford study, the best known lentivirus
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  is the human immune deficiency pathogen
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  which causes AIDS.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  This is why we are seeing autoimmune
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  and neurodegenerative decline after COVID-19,
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  especially the booster.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  This is a condition known as prion
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  and the mRNA from the lentivirus cocktail
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  is inserted into the DNA of human cells
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  through an invasive procedure, injection
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  and permanently changes the genoma of the cell.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  As Gateway Pundit reported, Richard Jefferson Bustamante Bautista
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  suffered a horrific adverse reaction
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  reportedly due to the Pfizer vaccine.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  Days after receiving his second dose,
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  he developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome,
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  a rare serious disorder of the skin and mucous membranes.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  And as Substack points out,
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  on the subject of excess deaths of youths,
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  and her Edward Dowd, he was a portfolio manager
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  for the multinational investment firm BlackRock
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  saying the millennials about ages 25 to 40
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  experienced an 84% increase in excess mortality last fall,
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  describing it as the worst ever excess mortality, I think, in history.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  It was the highest increase in excess deaths of any age group last year,
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  seven times higher than the silent generation who are older than 85.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  And the increase coincided with the vaccine mandates
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  and the approval of the booster shots.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  Basically, millennials experienced a Vietnam War
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  in the second half of 2021, Dowd said,
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  noting 58,000 people died in that conflict.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  I love the smell of that come in the morning.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  And as the casualties and injuries continue to pile up for celebrities
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  from the very real possibility of the mRNA vaccine,
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  67-year-old Bruce Willis' recent announcement of aphasia
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  ending his career has doctors immediately ruling out the vaccine as causal.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  Regardless of the many COVID vaccine recipients reporting brain fog
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  and a failure to concentrate after taking the vaccine,
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  while the VAERS data shows 3,057 cases where aphasia is a symptom due to the COVID-19 vaccine.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  It's on infowars.com right now.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  It's live-saving. Please get it out.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three-part Founder Series
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  at 1776coin.com or infowarstore.com
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  and the second installment is the Tree of Liberty.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  Thomas Jefferson, quote, must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  It's a coin I designed. I'm very, very proud of it.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  And it will end up being a collectible.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  for three times what we sold it.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  and I appreciate listeners getting over half of them now.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  I'd like to lose them out very quickly.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  And without the last coin sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  We would have had to lay off a lot of people and that's a big problem.
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  So it's a limited edition collectible, tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  So please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the New World Order at 1776coin.com.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  We are living in incredible times when we're watching a depopulation operation happen via COVID-19,
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  creating a lab and the vaccine that's actually more of the same weapon.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  It's biblical, it's amazing, it's not marriage, but we are here at least exposing it
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  and fighting on to warn as many people as we possibly can.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  That's why you sharing the articles, the videos, the live feeds is literally the heart of the battle.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  If you don't do it, we're going to lose.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  If you take action, we're going to win together.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  So I wanted to get to this little clip here.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  I've got quite a few actually, but this is a clip dealing with the whole vaccine situation
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  and what's unfolding with that.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  It's clip four, miscarriages, 50% in vaccinated women, miscarriages, 75% in vaccinated women in the first trimester.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  This is actually in the New England Medical Journal and a bunch of others.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  You think, well, where are the ambulance chasing lawyers?
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  They're not given the green light by the bar.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  Well, the Democratic Party to do that, but here's a clip.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  Medicine, one of the wonderful doctors we have here is a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  He runs a fertility clinic and he showed that, and obviously people who come to fertility clinics
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  have difficulty getting pregnant.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  So he says that his data correlates with the rest of the world, corresponds with the rest of the world,
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  that about 13% of pregnant women have miscarriages.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  That's sad, but that's the reality of people in fertility clinics.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  He said with vaccinated women, it goes up to 50% and with vaccinated women in the first trimester,
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  if they were vaccinated in the first trimester, 75% miscarriage.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  These are facts that are just being ignored and he's got to come up with a way now of getting them out into the public domain.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  All right, so now let's move.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  That's what's happening over in Australia.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  Now let's move to a very, very important piece of information.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  And that's Peter Ducey asking Saki how they can say if Obama supposedly had COVID
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  and everybody else has COVID while they're hugging and kissing and how that's not close contact.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  And again, it's all hyper-fraud, close contact, hugging, all that actually early on.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  A lot of people just create antibodies and get over it. It's locking folks up in their houses that causes all the big mutations and the rest of it.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  But the point is they're telling you to keep school kids locked down and toddlers with masks and all this.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  We see all the Hollywood parties and the rest of it where the elites aren't wearing masks,
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  but their servants and butlers and minions are.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  I mean, this is a cult where right out in front of your face, like all that famous book by George Arwell on Animal Farm,
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  where at first the pigs convinced other farm animals to rebel against the humans.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  That's the archetype of the sitting elite and aristocrats in government by saying four legs good, two legs bad.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  But then once the pigs take over, they say, well, two legs good, four legs good.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  And then later they say, actually, four legs bad, two legs good because the pigs start walking upright.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  And so that's how this hypocrisy works. They're like, you wear your mask, you do all this, but we don't.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  Four legs bad, two legs good.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  It all started out with four legs good, two legs bad.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  Here is that clip.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  It will be an outside event and we'll be marking it in that way.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  Thanks, Jen.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  How do you guys say that President Biden was not a close contact with Speaker Pelosi when there is video of the speaker kissing him?
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  Well, Peter, the way that it is defined is by the Center for Disease Control, the CDC,
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  and their definition of it is 15 minutes of contact within a set period of time and within six feet.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  It did not meet that bar. It does not mean that no one will get COVID around the world who does not have a close contact.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  It just means we are defining for all of you whether the President and their interaction met the definition of the CDC of a close contact.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  I have the cabinet was there on Tuesday, at least two additional cabinet members.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  So let's back that up about 10 seconds. I love the zombies hugging each other. She's got her hands like the swamp thing or the thing from the black lagoon.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  She's like grabbing him and I mean both of these mummies.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  This is who rules us.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  A bunch of sycophantic scum that is hijacked the government that now wants to declare any opposition as illegal.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  We are in quite the pickle.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  Anyway, you slice it.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  All right, I want to give the number up for first time callers.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  We don't screen your calls. All we ask for is a good, clean phone line.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  So we can hear what you have to say. We're going to go to you and move the next person so everybody gets on.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  I love your calls. Any subject you want to call in about, it's just got to have a clean phone line and we're going to go to your calls.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  The toll-free number is 877-789-2539. 877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  And we will get you up, ladies and gentlemen, on the air.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  So please, I want to hear from you.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  If you disagree, you agree. All I ask for is you got a clean phone line. We want to hear from you.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  Again, toll-free number to join us, 877-789-2539-877-789.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  Alex and your calls are coming up.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  Now, I've covered, I'm doing okay today. I've covered 30% of the news in the first hour and 12 minutes or so.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  I'm going to go to your calls first.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  But interspersed with the calls, we've got this very important question
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  that's being asked by the corporate media everywhere that is so central.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  Everyone, even New York Times, not just Town Hall, liberal and conservative, are asking this big question.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  How on earth are Democrats, when Biden on average has a 30% or lower percent poll, the lowest of any president ever,
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  even in establishment polls that sample 10 to 15 to 20 points more for Democrats,
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  how on earth are they in the midterms going to retain anything when even major blue states are going Republican,
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  hoping to just end this nightmare of gas prices and open borders and collapsing country and war and all the rest of it?
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  And the answer is election fraud.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  And that's why they don't care. That's why they're going to turn pipelines off.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  That's why they're going to open borders up. That's why they're going to teach drag queen pedophile time.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  That's why they do it all because they know in blue cities and states, in almost every case the fix is in,
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  it came out that Bill Barr as Attorney General blocked an investigation that the FBI wanted to have of 200 plus thousand ballots
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  from one state being driven into Pennsylvania confirmed and instead basically threatened to indict the postal worker
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  that thought it was suspicious and looked in it.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  Shipping in pre-printed ballots to steal the election.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  And how do you get away with that? Well, you get away with it by controlling the Justice Department
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  and that's where all this insanity and all this arrogance and all this chutzpah and all of this bravada
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  and whatever you want to call it comes from, but also the ineptitude of the globalists
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  because they can just commit any damn crime they want. You have Hunter Biden with tens of thousands of horrible crimes
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  on his laptop and just things that are unspeakable and Chinese top spy generals running him
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  and he's talking about it and payoffs to his father, hundreds of millions of dollars.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  And the corporate media completely and totally shut that story down.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  And that's why they hate talk radio. That's why they hate what's left of the free Internet
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  is because that's a place where no matter what they do, it still comes out.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  Because they might have successfully suppressed Hunter Biden's laptop in the last month of the election
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  and national polls show that Trump would have won even despite the fraud by 17 extra points.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  So they stole three points from to win. So that means 13 plus point victory for Trump in national polls
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  if they had known about Hunter Biden and the crackhead stuff and the trophy photos
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  with his naked niece and all the rest of it.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  I'm glad to hear at least 70% of Democrats aren't pedophiles or crackheads or Chinese spies
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  but surprise there's not more, but that's a huge win for Trump.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  But notice they didn't get a chance to see it because it got suppressed as fake and Russian propaganda
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  but it wasn't. It was all real.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  The Liberty Tree Coin is being offered and it will probably sell out in 10 days again.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  It certainly needs to the front of operation. It is so historic and it has a quote from
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty being refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants and more.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com. It's also at infowarestore.com.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  It's amazing. There's only 10,000 of them and as a founding member,
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  if we're able to stay on the air, we're planning something very, very special for everyone
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  that helps us go to the next level. So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  at 1776coin.com.
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  You know, it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty,
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at infowars.com
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  and we are funded by listeners and viewers like you and so now we need to support more than ever
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  because this fight has intensified. Don't need me to tell you that at infowars.com.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now. Things have been sold out for a long time
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  like info wars life, fizzy magnesium mix that's so amazing and our new immune support formula
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  that's so critical. They're all available 25 to 75% off at infowars.com right now.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowars.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  and that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains are broken down
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  and infowars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for operations
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalist making their main move.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  Infowars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people than ever despite the censorship
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  but because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  and everything else, we are running out of money. So listen, up to 75% off at infowars.com
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  on things like amazing patriot t-shirts that helps spread the word and fund the operation
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  on supplements, on books, on films, everything is 25 to 75% off right now.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  The biggest sale in our history at infowars.com. Thank you for your support.

[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  but in this globalist era, with all the criminal activity they're involved in, it is more important than ever
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  to take the tools God gave us and supercharge our immune systems.

[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live about to go to Joshua, Steve, James, Cobra, John, Sean, John and many others
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  on this live Friday edition. But first I wanted to hit this. Again, they can try to censor, they can try to debank,
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  they can try to block people, they can sue people but you're not going to stop humanity from wanting the truth.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  And our greatest achievement here at infowars is studying the globalist white papers, their operations,
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  warning the public worldwide and seeing all these populist leaders get elected that are aware of Soros
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  and the WEF and the rest of it and to just see how many big talk show hosts now, the most popular in every country in the world
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  are telling the truth and get who the enemy is and that's why they're in full panic mode right now.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  And want to set the precedent to destroy those that stand up to their tyranny.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  So beautiful student-confronts fake news purveyor Brian Stelter from CNN at disinfo conference and it's glorious.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  That's what the Gateway pundit Jim Hoff had to say and it's also on infowars.com if you want to see it.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  And this went on and on. I watched a bunch of this this morning. I mean people just hit them and hit them and hit them
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  and they're fake news and how are they now posing as the who's going to censor who's going to control when they are the definition of fake news.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  Here it is.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  Hi, thank you for coming. My name is Christopher Phillips. I'm a first year at the college. My questions were Mr. Stelter.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  You've all spoken extensively about Fox News being a purveyor of disinformation, but CNN is right up there with them.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  They pushed the Russian collusion hoax. They pushed the Jesse Smollett hoax.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  They smeared Justice Kavanaugh as a rapist and they also smeared Nick Sandman as a white supremacist.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  And yes, they dismissed the Hunter Biden laptop affair as pure Russian disinformation.
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  With mainstream corporate journalists becoming little more than apologists and cheerleaders for the regime,
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  is it time to finally declare that the canon of journalistic ethics is dead or no longer operative?
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  All the mistakes of the mainstream media and CNN in particular seem to magically all go in one direction.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  Are we expected to believe that this is all just some sort of random coincidence or is there something else behind it?
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  It's too bad. It's time for lunch.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  You have 30 seconds.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  There's a clock that says 30 seconds, but I think my honest answer to you, and I'll come over and talk in more detail after this,
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  is that I think you're describing a different channel than the one that I watch.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  But I understand that that is a popular right-wing narrative about CNN.
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  I think it's important when we talk about shared reality and democracy, all these networks, all these outlets have to defend democracy.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  And when they screw up, admit it.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  But when Benjamin Hall, the Fox correspondent, was wounded in Ukraine,
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  the news crews at CNN in the New York Times stopped what they were doing and they tried to help.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  They tried to help them get out of the country. They tried to find the dead crew members.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  That's what news outlets do.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  That's how they actually do work together to your question about sharing those kinds of connections and trust.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  We don't talk about it enough, though.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  We don't share that reality about how that happens.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  And with regards to the regime, I think you mean the President Biden.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  The last time I spoke with a Biden aide, we yelled at each other.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  So that's the reality of the news business that people don't see, that people don't hear.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  They imagine that it's a situation that simply is not.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  But I think your question, it speaks to the failure of journalism to show our work and show the reality of how our profession operates.
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  We have a lot of work to do, I think.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  Did you hear that? Oh, those are Fox News talking points that they lied about the Hunter Biden laptop.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  They lied about Jesse Smallup that they lied about Peter Sandman that they on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  Forever lying on purpose.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  I mean, we've made a few mistakes here and they get pumped up and promoted and pushed like it's everything we do when we admit we make mistakes.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  These people engage in deception on purpose.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  Have you noticed with my show 90% of the time when I'm talking about something, we show you the video or the audio.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  We show you the article to go find more.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  When you turn to CNN, they say, Alex Jones is a white supremacist.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  Do they show me supporting Hitler, that loser?
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  Do they show me hailing Hitler? No.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  No, they don't.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  They have New York Times articles saying we had a fish at the office and I reached in the fishbowl and ate it.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  I've never had a fish at the office and I don't even really like fish that much.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  I wouldn't eat a well-cooked fish most of the time.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  I had beef instead, but it doesn't matter.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  It's just fancy lies so big that people go, well, it's got to be true.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  I mean, the New York Times isn't going to say a poor employee had a little fish and Jones goes, why do you have a fish and grabs it and eats it?
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  And you're like, where have I heard of that before? Wolf of Wall Street.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  And again, the only reason I tell that story is they are consciously lying.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  I have never consciously lied.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  Have I been sitting up here with heartburn or headache sometimes and gotten something wrong or I've handed something.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  I think it's the one document, it's another, and I get something all the time.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  All the time.
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  I caught myself in the last hour going, you know, these supermodels go out there to Africa to shoot video for the dying kids and then,
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  you know, the cameraman and everybody leave and the kids die and we take care of them.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  And my crew member said, hey, actually the guy that took this photo, which I knew that I'd forgotten it.
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  He died, he committed suicide after he saw the little baby die.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  I'm like, oh my gosh, you forgot about that. I wasn't clear about that. Let me fix that.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  And that was in one segment and four minutes later, next segment, I came out last hour and I corrected it right then.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  Because I got a crew in there of six people and they're not perfect, just like me, and they're watching.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  They're watching.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  And if they see something, they think it's wrong or they think I got something wrong and it happens every day,
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  they come and say, hey, you got this wrong.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  You need to get that right.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  And do I go like a primadonna? You get out of here.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  No, I'm like, oh my gosh, I forgot.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  It sounded like I was saying this photographer didn't care. I was talking about all the other ones.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  Oh yeah.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  Because they literally go out to dead and starving people and shoot a photo, shoot it, spin all the news,
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  and give them none of the money or support.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  I mean, here's the deal.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  The Salvation Army spends about 90% of the money they get on the people.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  That's incredible to only spend 10%.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  They're the model. They're not perfect either. They've gotten all woke and they're bad now.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  But the point is,
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  Bono has been running for 30 years, his foundation, that they admit was giving less than 1%.
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  Once people complained, he started giving 1.2%.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  Imagine running telephones all over the world, everybody airs, and you beg for money for starving children,
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  and you keep 99%.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  That is a monster.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  And that's why the globalists love him.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  It's like Klaus Schwab, and that's why Bill Gates vacationed with him,
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  because he's just a fake dude with pink sunglasses who is a freaking monster.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  And again, they were giving like 0.9% before, and now it's 0.12, or 1.2.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  How do you do that? How do you sit there and beg for money for people to say it's for starving Africans,
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  and then you keep the damn money?
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  How could you come up with somebody like that?
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  We're not saying while he's raising money or going to Africa to help people, he shouldn't be on a private jet,
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  or shouldn't pay for his expenses, but the point is, is that he doesn't do any of that.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  He keeps every freaking nickel, and he doesn't even go to Africa.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  This is a greedy, monstrous devil.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  And he's going to be made in hell to eat all those gold coins.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  I mean that metaphysically. All right, we're going to break. We're going to go right back to your calls.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  Straight ahead, ladies and gentlemen. Joshua, Steve, James, Cobra, Don, John, Sean, John, Elizabeth, Alex,
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  and the order that received your calls live on air to millions straight ahead
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  in defiance of tyranny, in defense of liberty.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  infowars.com lives.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three-part Founder Series at 1776coin.com,
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:10.000]  or infowars.com, and the second installment is the Tree of Liberty.
[1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  Thomas Jefferson, quote, must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  It's a coin I designed. I'm very, very proud of it, and it will end up being a collectible.
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what we sold it.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly, and I appreciate listeners getting over half of them now.
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:37.000]  I'd like to move them out very quickly. I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days.
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  And without the last coin sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  We would have had to lay off a lot of people, and that's a big problem.
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  So it was a limited edition collectible, tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom,
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  So please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the new order at 1776coin.com.
[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  We are only offering three coins in the series.
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  The first coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days.
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  Now, the second coin as we enter the last days of March into April 2022 is now being offered.
[1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  I believe it will sell out in just a few days again because these are historic coins
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep in full wars
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  at the front lines of the fight against these tyrants.
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:33.000]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty Tree coin.
[1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  It is powerful.
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:40.000]  Witness this powerful iconography for yourself and have this piece of history
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  and be part of the founding member system that we're set to launch in the very near future
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:49.000]  thanks to your support of this project.
[1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  Get a historic memento that helps keep info wars on the air
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:58.000]  and also gives you a real piece of history at 1776coin.com.
[1:30:58.000 --> 1:31:03.000]  April 2022 just kicked off and it's already been incredible.
[1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, Joe Biden, they along with many other new order operatives
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:15.000]  have gone on national television and announced that we are now under a world government.
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:20.000]  They have a summit taking place right now in Dubai titled World Government Summit
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:23.000]  and they are announcing incredible tyranny.
[1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:28.000]  Everything we've talked about is now coming true and the globalists want to take us off air.
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:34.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running the biggest sale in the history of info wars right now.
[1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:40.000]  In our 28 years, all info wars apparel is being sold at cost until the inventory is gone
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:45.000]  and we're never going to print these t-shirts and ball caps and info wars flags again.
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  We may have t-shirts in apparel in the future, but I don't even know.
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  We are blowing out of everything to get emergency funds in right now.
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  I'm firing the bat signal and asking you to get your t-shirts at infowarstore.com right now.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:31:59.000]  They're at cost.
[1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out.
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:13.000]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the creator,
[1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  and we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much.
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy, is it true?
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  They read all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God of this world who is a loser.
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever.
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe handling.
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:59.000]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:04.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  So we saw the student confront fake news purveyor Brian Stelter, the self appointed globalist of disinformation censorship.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  Him being destroyed with the facts of certified documented proven hoax stories they ran.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  Many of which they've paid federal elections commission fines for.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  And his answer is that's a right wing talking point that doesn't exist even though we all know it exists.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  And that ties into this NBC News US putting out phony intel as part of info war with Russia.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  And I really resent that they use the term info war.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  The Pentagon calls it that as deception.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  No info war can be true.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  It can be a lie or it can be a mix of the two.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  So we call it info wars is getting people aware of the fact that there's a what a war on for your mind.
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  But now more and more here the term info war info war.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  Again, I was sitting there in 1997 and on the air a few years.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  A retired Air Force intelligence officer deputy fire chief good friend of mine Vic Vreeland said you need a website over to south drinking beer with him.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  His wife have a dinner.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  He's an older guy.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  Got the parents talk to sitting around in south Austin.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  And I said, what's the name?
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  He goes, you know, you're involved in information warfare.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  Let's see if info wars is available info war wasn't available info wars was.
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  We got it.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  That's history.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  But that's just like I didn't come up with the answer to 1984 1776 a famous British economist that advised the main government was the top economist in England.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  I don't know who he was when I met him.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  He died like a year after I interviewed him at Bilderberg 2006 in Canada.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  He said, you know, Alex, you know, Alex, it's a mathematical equation.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  Liberty of us is telling me the answer is 1984 is 1776.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  But that's a great idea.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  And I had dinner with him and drank some beer with him and Jim Tucker and back to even Google people's names.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  But he was like, I was once an economist.
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  I looked the guy up later.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  He was like super famous.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  But the point is that cool saying came from them.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  And that's what info wars is.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  It's not about Alex Jones.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  It's not about you.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  It's not about your neighbor.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  It's about all of us together.
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  How we all come up with really cool stuff.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  So yeah, that's our slogan.
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, but it didn't come from me.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  It came from you.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  I did come up with info wars tomorrow's news today.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  That's kind of a cool, cool little deal.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  But the point is all of our victories together are victories for all of us.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  So NBC News, US putting out phony intel as part of info war with Russia.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  And then here's the actual, because I'm not just going to show you an info wars article.
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  You know, who knows, maybe we're lying.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  I always say, trust me that I'm not trying to lie to you,
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  but I get stuff wrong.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  Sometimes you should check.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  Like Ronald Reagan said, trust me, verify.
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  But here's the NBC article.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  Go read it.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  They say lying's good when it's for stopping bad guys.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  In a break with the past, the US is using intel to fight an info war with Russia,
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  even when the intel isn't rock solid.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  That's a nice way of putting it.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  All right, let's go to your phone calls Joshua in Pennsylvania.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  Thank you so much for holding.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  Welcome.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  Hey, Alex, how's it going?
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  Quick plug for your product.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  The official man is amazing.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  Like the highest quality stuff I've used.
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  I've used Nordic's naturals from vitamin shop.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  And this stuff is way beyond it.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  So yeah.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  And the iodine is great too.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  I mean, it just awakens your new mentally.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  You just feel way more energized.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  Yeah, people need to get that stuff now.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  No doubt.
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  Absolutely.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  So I found this quote that is pretty, pretty incredible.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  It's from 1962.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  And just bear with me.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  I'm going to read it.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  The image of the world as traced in my imagination.
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  Cold world.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  The cold war will be a thing of the past internal pressure of the constantly growing
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  intelligency in Russia for more freedom in the pressure of the masses for raising
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  their living standards may lead to a gradual democratization of the Soviet Union.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  This was in 1962.
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  On the other hand, the increasing influence of the workers and farmers and the rising
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  political importance of men of science may transform the United States into a
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  welfare state with a planned economy.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  Essentially what's happening now.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  Western and Eastern Europe will become a federation of autonomous states having a
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  socialist and democratic regime with the exception of the USSR or Russia.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  As the federated Eurasian state, all other continents will become united in a
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  world alliance at whose disposal will be an international police force.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  All armies will be abolished and there will be no more wars in Jerusalem.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  The United Nations.
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  It's really United Nations will build a shrine of the profits to serve the
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  federated Union of all continents.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  This will be the seat of the Supreme Court of mankind to settle all controversies
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  among the federated continents as prophesied by Isaiah.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  Higher education will be the right of every person in the world.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  A pill to prevent pregnancy will slow down the explosive natural increase in the
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  world, particularly in China, India.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  And by 1987, the average life span may reach 100 years.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  This was the founder of Israel, David Ben-Gurion, then the first prime minister.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  So this guy obviously knew something.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  How about it?
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  And most of what he said is actually unfolded and come true.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  So yes, that gets in a State Department of Random 7277, which was officially signed
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  in the U.S. government policy by Kennedy in 62.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  Have you ever seen 7277?
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  Wow, it's amazing.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  And then they whacked him.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  It's all there, brother.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  It's all there.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  It's incredible.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  I'm really glad you brought that up.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  How do people find that Ben-Gurion quote?
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  You've got to do some digging.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  It's from Look Magazine, January 16, 1962.
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  All right, so Ben-Gurion interview, Look Magazine 62.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  Thank you, brother.
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  All right, let's move to the next person here.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  I'm going in the order the calls are received.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  Let's go to Cobra in Massachusetts.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  Great to finally get through to you, Alex.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  First of all, I want to talk about, sometimes you say it's a two-way win for your products.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  It's actually a two-for-one win for us.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  We get great products that keep us healthy and alive and great information.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  And then in return, you get funded.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  So it's actually, we get two things and you get one.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  Good news without you, brother.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  It's a no-brainer.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  Yep, it's a no-brainer.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  What I want to talk about is I've actually worked with pharmaceuticals for over 20 years.
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  They bring my company in when the drugs come in the market.
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  And I've worked at many pharmaceuticals and only about 5% of all drugs that try to go to market make it.
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  So when I heard that there were no phase three long-term trials,
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  I literally pulled what you did on one of the shows where you said impossible five straight times.
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  I mean, that is impossible.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  And the reason I say that is because, and I've worked a long time with this,
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  whenever there's short-term side effects, especially death,
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  they shut it down because the long-term is exponentially worse.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  So unfortunately, what you might see here is something really, really bad.
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  And it is not by accident.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  This whole thing is intentional, completely intentional.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  And if you knew what I knew, you'd be really scared for these people that got this shot.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  Well, let me give us your research, experience, knowledge,
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  a few more minutes on why you're so concerned.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  Just because, I mean, when a drug's coming to market,
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  you have to learn everything about the drugs.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  So I see all the side effects and the short-term side effects.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  They don't worry about it because they know the amount of poison they put in these in a shot or vaccine.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  So they know short-term is not a big deal because they know how much poison they're going to kill somebody.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  They don't know the long-term effect.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  And they never did a safe study, a trial on long-term effects.
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  And now you see in short-term, so many short-term.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  We're still in short-term now.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  So I'm not saying it's going to happen, but from my experience,
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  from what I've seen and studying a drug,
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  I'm basically adopted because they make you study everything about the drug
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  and not many of them go to market because it's so hard to get approved
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  and just to see that no longer...
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  This whole thing skipped any basic trials and they covered up what was in the live trial databases,
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  which is just mass murder.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  Well said. Thank you, Cobra.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  All right, we're going to go to break. We're going to come right back.
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  Take five calls the next segment and then a whole another hour of phone calls
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  and breaking news straight ahead, infowars.com.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  It's a catch-22.
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  Infowars and Bandai Video have become a mothership
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  promoting the pro-human-liberty movement worldwide.
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter,
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  So the biggest sale in infowars history is going right now,
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  the mega-emergency blowout sale up to 75% off,
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  getting credible products and keeping infowars as strong as ever.
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability,
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:05.000]  anything that's really satisfying and empowering and fulfilling
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  is going to be hard to attain.
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  And when it comes to information, boy, is that true today.
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  We see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation,
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  great reset combine,
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes,
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  their transhumanist nightmare vision,
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  suppressing the voices of good people all around the world
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria,
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  their world's gonna end in 2030,
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  And none of it can succeed.
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  None of it can actually be carried out
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  unless everybody is silenced and gaslit.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  And that's why it's hard to share infowars links and ban video links.
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  This is the best bone broth out there.
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  Here's an M4WarsStore.com today.

[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  From a deeper perspective, I think it really is going to shape the future of humanity
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  and the future of life itself.
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  Because the new technologies will soon give some corporations
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  and governments the ability to hack human beings.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  There is a lot of talk about hacking computers,
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  smartphone, emails, bank accounts,
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  but the really big thing is hacking human beings.
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  To hack human beings, you need a lot of biological knowledge,
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  a lot of computing power, and especially a lot of data.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  If you have enough data about me,
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  and enough computing power and biological knowledge,
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  you can hack my body, my brain, my life.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  You can reach a point when you know me better than I know myself.
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  And once you reach that point, and we are very close to that point,
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  then democracy, the free market, and actually all political systems,
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  also authoritarian regimes, we have no idea what happens once you pass that point.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  But he promotes an authoritarian system where they force you to do this.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  He says, the days of your free will are over,
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  but oh, he thinks he'll be programming it.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  That's one of the Davos groups top, quote, scientists.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  And it's everything I'm warning you about, but I'm saying it's bad.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  He's saying it's good.
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  But when I say it's bad, oh, I get attacked and lied about and sued.
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  When he says it's good, we should follow it all.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  All right, let's go back to your phone calls here.
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  Let's go to James in West Virginia.
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  James, thank you for calling.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  A couple of points I'd like to make real quick.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  Number one is our Senator Joe Manchin.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  He's a Democrat, but oftentimes he's, you know, he's pretty good.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  He hardly sidelines with most of the Democrats when it comes to doing what is actually right for the state.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  And I'm usually pretty, pretty impressed with him.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  Sure, he's one of the populace.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  Yeah, right.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  But this time when he voted for Katanji Jackson, I was very, very upset with that.
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  And I just kind of shocked.
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  I didn't think he was going to do it just because of his previous, you know, stances on what's right and giving her her history in the court.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  I just was a little shocked to see that.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  And I'm pretty mad about it.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  Well, you saw some Republicans vote for her as well.
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  And again, I don't give a flying, you know what, that she's got dark skin.
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  If she was a patriot, great.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  Love a black woman on there.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  It's that she is a horrible Pito protector.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  But who do you think Joe Biden, the Pito granddaddy is going to put in there?
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  Well, I mean, I should have been expected.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  Yeah, I didn't expect less, but I was just shocked that he sidelines with him on that one.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  Because often, like I said, he does not.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  He was a real fight, you know, for Joe getting some stuff across the table.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  You know, he's, he's, he's opposing me.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  Well, sure.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  I mean, I mean, the Democrats get mad at anyone.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  They don't support carbon taxes and things like that that would totally end the country.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  You're absolutely right.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  Thanks to the call, brother.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  Okay, let's go to Sean in Virginia.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  Thanks for calling.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  Go ahead, Sean.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  Hi, Alex.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  Afternoon.
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  How you doing?
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  I'm just living inside the new role order now, bro.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  It's going to get crazier for me right now.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  You got that, right?
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  Look, I'm, I'm a father.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  I'm a veteran.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  I'm a red blooded American and I'm pissed.
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  I've been listening.
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  I've been listening to you forever, man.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  And I love you.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  And I can't believe I've had so much I wanted to say and talk about, but I've had to take
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  a break, man.
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  The past two, three weeks or so, I've had to turn everything off.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  I was, I was on a hair trigger.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  I was pissed off at everybody just getting mad and I had to step back.
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  But what I wanted to, what came to my mind first today is communication.
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  I wanted to pick your brain.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  What do we do?
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  I mean, we know they're going to turn the lights out.
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  We know they're going to turn the internet off.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  So let's, let's think about it now and prepare right now.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  How do, how do we act?
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  How do we, you know, expose the Davos group next move after a viral release is a war,
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  an economic collapse and then sporadic power outages to totally crater civilization.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  And if people read that from Klaus Schwab and know ahead of time, then if they dare do
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  it, the states will organize and others will realize what's happening.
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  But we won't even have the gas power plants or the pipelines during a shutdown to get
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  the stuff in we need.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  But most of America is somewhat self-sufficient other than areas in California and New York
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  and, you know, like Connecticut in a few places.
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  And so that's why they're shutting our infrastructure off to make us dependent when they go for the
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  jugular.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  Because, because we know that they'll just leave their lines open, their media outlets,
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  you know, what they want us to hear and program.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  Yeah, they're essential.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  We're non-essential.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  Yes.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  Well, should we start buying printing presses?
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  I mean, that's where we're going back.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  If they shut down.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  You're a smart guy.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  You're thinking about what to do once they hit us with that.
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  And I agree we should be doing some of that planning.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  But how about stopping them now?
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  How about saying no to their plan now?
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  Because if there's enough heat on them that look at COVID, we partially back them off
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  to at least take the pressure off because they saw our opposition exploding.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  We were about to politically take over.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  So they back off as soon as we're about to win.
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  And then they bring it back later.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  Exactly.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  Do you think that I know that there's been a lull that they've let us go here for a little
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  bit with the COVID scenarios.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  Do you think that they've lost people's minds in that aspect when they try to turn it back
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  on that they're going to lose a big percentage of the people that they had captured?
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  Absolutely.
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  I mean, as things get worse and worse, they're going to lose almost everybody, but then
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  the people will blame the government instead of the globalist and control the government.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  And obviously the government's out of control and I'm at the government, but it's an extension
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  of us losing control of it.
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  So Larry Fink and Bill Gates and all the usual suspects, Klaus Schwab, obsess on governments
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  are failing.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  We need corporate rulership and we need digital currencies and we need social credit scores
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  and we need virtual basic incomes, which Elon Musk just announced and said, we need them
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  to play that next hour.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  And so again, they create the crisis and are for the solution.
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  Yep.
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  And I feel like if they do or if and when they do shut things down, you know, if we
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:05.500]  do have those things in line like a printing press or something, we'll have a chance to
[1:54:05.500 --> 1:54:11.000]  recapture people's minds because their machine will be on pause for whatever reason they're
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  using port at that time.
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  But just thoughts, man.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  Hey, keep it up, Alex.
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  I love you.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  Sean, we love you too.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  Thank you so much for calling.
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  All right, go to the next call or they're received.
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  Steve North Dakota.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  Steve, welcome.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  Go ahead.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  Well, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  Yes, sir.
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  Have you ever heard of a guy called, he goes by the name of Ice Age Farmer?
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  I have heard of that.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  One of my producers told me about him.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  So I should get him on.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:37.760]  He's laying out.
[1:54:37.760 --> 1:54:45.000]  He warned they would use the caravans, right, as a, as a pretext to bring in martial law,
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  right?
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  They're going after their cop.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  They just burn blue and they're going around killing thousands of not millions of turkeys
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  and chickens.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  So when Joe Biden says there's food stories coming, there is.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  Because they're, they're produced.
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  They're doing it.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  Well, that's right.
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  There's major supply breakdowns everywhere.
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  It's the post industrial world.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  It's everything you see with extinction rebellion, but at the, at the higher level, extinction
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  rebellion is the lower level minions, but Klaus Schwab is the high priest of that.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  Bird flu cases forced killing of 5.3 million chickens in Iowa alone.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  I'm glad you mentioned that.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  That was in my stack to mention.
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  Yeah, they're using the same PCR test they use for COVID to test these, all these chickens
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  that took it for bird flu.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  And then there's wiping out the whole flock.
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  They did the same thing with spongy form and seven lobby.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  Most of the cows and sheep didn't have it.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  But they used a false test.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  Remember that?
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  What was that 20 years ago and killed basically all the cows and sheep in Britain?
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  Well, and they're also telling the railroad companies to stop delivering grain or feed
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  to all the major cattle and dairy producers.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  So they're going to have to call their herd because they can't feed them.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  When they talk about flu shortage, they are creating it.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  Steve preach it.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  You are dead on everything you're saying.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  They're just pulling up mainstream news.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  You could just see it every level to cut off the pipelines, cut off the oil drilling,
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  cut off the gas drilling, cut off the chickens, cut off the turkeys, cut off the green,
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  cut it off, cut it off.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  Yeah, but one more thing.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  You guys say it's calm world.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  I prefer the term bizarre world.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  I hear your brother.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  God bless.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  We'll be right back next hour with all the great callers that are patiently holding
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  like Don and John and Lang and Elizabeth and Alex and so many other straight ahead
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  power.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  Number three, just a few minutes away.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  And yes, we need your support.
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  Folks, this is the last weekend for 40% off on Vaso beats.

[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  the body.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  Every cell must have it to operate.
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  It's 40% off.

[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  nine.
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  We will not be able to stay on your support.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  We appreciate your support.
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  Don't forget this weekend.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  It's going to sell out and that is the part two of the coin series.
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  The founder coin series at 1776coin.com and your funding of that coin helps us stay on
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  there and build new systems.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:43.000]  1776coin.com will sell out within two days.
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  Stay with us.
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  We are only offering three coins in the series.
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  The first coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days.
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  Now, the second coin as we enter the last days of March into April, 2022, is now available
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:08.000]  and I believe it will sell out in just a few days again because these are historic coins
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep info wars at the
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  front lines of the fight against these tyrants.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty Tree coin.
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  It is powerful.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  Witness this powerful iconography for yourself and have this piece of history and be part
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  of the founding member system that we're set to launch in the very near future thanks to
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  your support of this project.
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  Get a historic memento that helps keep info wars on the air and also gives you a real
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:47.000]  piece of history at 1776coin.com.
[1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  and that is because the economy is breaking down.
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:01.000]  Inflation is exploding.
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:07.000]  The supply chains have broken down and info wars is having serious trouble making its
[1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  payroll and paying for operations and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  of the globalists making their main move.
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  Info wars, it's paradoxical.
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  It's more popular than ever.
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  It is reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  some bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of money.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  So listen, up to 75% off infowarstore.com on things like amazing patriot t-shirts that
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  helps spread the word and fund the operation.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:43.000]  On supplements, on books, on films, everything is 25 to 75% off right now.
[1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  The biggest sell in our history at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:49.000]  Thank you for your support.
[1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:58.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:59:58.000 --> 2:00:04.000]  Federal bunglers of injustice, the FBI and the federal prosecutors once again fumbled
[2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:10.000]  their first amendment violating undercover operations after misleading a federal court
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:16.000]  seeking unwarranted gag orders during a federal investigation of Project Veritas' ties to
[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  the alleged theft of a diary belonging to President Joe Biden's daughter Ashley Biden.
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  Politico claimed that the raids generated controversy in some circles because Project
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  Veritas identifies itself as a news organization and the use of search warrants against journalists
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  and news outlets is extremely rare due to justice department policies and a federal
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:45.000]  law passed in 1980 to limit such investigative steps.
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  After Project Veritas rated Roger Stone's style, US District Court Judge Annalisa Torres agreed
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:59.000]  to a request by Project Veritas to appoint a special master to review the info on their
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  seized devices to ensure that prosecutors couldn't get access to their emails, their text messages
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  and other records that might be subject to attorney client privileges.
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  Lo and behold, Project Veritas' attorneys have now learned that for nearly a year before
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  the raids even occurred, prosecutors had already used gag orders within grand jury
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  subpoenas and court ordered seizures of all of the emails O'Keeffe and several Project
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  Veritas colleagues kept during a three month span in 2020.
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  Project Veritas is just one example of the war being waged on those who wield their first
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  rights in a bid to expose the truth.
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  Recently, the EU president tweeted that the state owned Russia Today in Sputnik and their
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  subsidiaries will no longer be able to spread lies to justify Putin's war and announced
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  a ban on these outlets.
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  Say what you want about invasive Russian propaganda.
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  The censorship of RT in Sputnik cancels any dialogue from the opposing side.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  Meanwhile, Info Wars faces down a Sandy Hook lawsuit engineered to set a precedent to cancel
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  any news organization that questions the mainstream media narrative, leading to the inevitability
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  that all dissent, even by individuals, will be outlawed.
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  They start out with demonizing me that I believe in a new world order and a global government.
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  And of course, just last week, the Davos Group met, announced world government planetary control.
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  And the title of this session, are we ready for a new world order?
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  And they're really thinking with this lawsuit, they're going to outlaw questioning big events
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  like WMDs in Iraq or Jesse Smollett or any of these things that have happened and that
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  questioning these and looking at the evidence and information is a crime.
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  But here's the big takeaway and I'll just admit it.
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  I could have done a better job on Sandy Hook.
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  Some of the anomalies that we reported on were not accurate and I admitted it years before I was sued.
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  But the issue is this is all about them being holier than thou and they're the arbiters of truth
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  and they're the Democrats and they're the ones that love you.
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  And Alex Jones is the devil to distract from how the corporate media has been caught lying to people
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  consciously about WMDs, the list literally goes on and on.
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  And what's crazy is the public's basically totally woken up, not just here but around the world
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  and nothing they're doing is reversing that but they pick these weird neurotic subjects
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  like January 6th where Alex Jones and Sandy Hook and they just obsess like a religion on that.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  And meanwhile I'm here in Connecticut, everywhere I go I'm just shaking hands, black, white, old, young, old, Alex Jones
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  but a lot of them are mad at me and they go, hey, we questioned Sandy Hook, why are you backing off?
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  And these folks don't even get up in their big ivory tower law firms that the world has moved on from their BS
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  and yeah, do I make mistakes? Yes, but I don't lie on purpose like the corporate media does on record.
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  And so I had the impression watching the attack on Mr. Jones that this trial will be about something far greater
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  than what happened at Sandy Hook. The trial is going to be about ordinary people's ability to say, I'm not buying it.
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  I want to raise questions, I want to draw my own conclusions.
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  I mean for those of us who missed the McCarthy era, I guess this president is intent on bringing it to us
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  but with new force and new power and new urgency unlike anything we've ever seen.
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  The federal government aided by tech overlords and a deeply propagandized media
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  is yet again flagrantly violating and abusing First Amendment rights in order to satisfy the dictatorial demands
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  of the creeping agenda of the New World Order. John Bowne reporting.
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:05:18.000]  They'll be back with your calls.
[2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  Now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin is being offered and it will probably sell out in 10 days again.
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  It certainly needs to in front of operation. It is so historic and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:37.000]  about the Tree of Liberty being refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants and more.
[2:05:37.000 --> 2:05:43.000]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com. It's also at infowarstore.com.
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  It's amazing. There's only 10,000 of them and as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air,
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  we're planning something very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:06:17.000]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:25.000]  Dr. Robert Malone is on target when he gives these big conferences all over the U.S. and the world to millions,
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  pointing out it's a New World Order. It's a global government. It's the world economic forum.
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:31.000]  They're the enemy. They've got to be driven from power. They're the ones penetrating our governments,
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  putting their cult members in control. Here it is.
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  They are coming from a belief system that says that nation-state is an obsolete idea
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  and we have to have a one-world government that is basically a fusion of the interests of corporations
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:53.000]  and politics, global politics. And we've got to start by finding out who they are,
[2:06:53.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  voting them out of office, making sure they are not part of our governments.
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:03.000]  Two notable characters here in the United States are governors Inslee and Newsom.
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:09.000]  We've got to out these people. We've got to force them to account for whether or not they're Americans
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:13.000]  or are they globalists? And if they're globalists, they've got to get out.
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:17.000]  We've got to get rid of them. We've got to take back ownership of our country.
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  If you believe in the Constitution, if you believe in the principles of free speech and personal autonomy,
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  medical autonomy and autonomy at every level, other level, it's time to fight.
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  Or your children are going to live in basically a techno-fascism for the rest of their natural lives
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  as serfs.
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  If they're lucky enough to even be alive.
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  Let's go to your calls quickly now, then I've got a Hillary Clinton clip coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  She's been confronted. Let's talk to John in Pennsylvania. John, welcome.
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  Good afternoon, Alex. It's actually an honor to talk with you.
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:07:59.000]  Honored to talk to you, brother. What's on your mind?
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:04.000]  I've been listening to you since Jesse Venture, conspiracy theory was on back in 2008.
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  Yes, sir. No, there's a video clip.
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  Actually, you're the one who gave Jesse Venture all his leads to most of his stories.
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  And I wanted to ask if you're still in touch with him at all.
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  No, I mean, I didn't give him most of his leads, but some of the first season's episodes, I gave him leads, some of the second season.
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  It got all UFOs and tube of cobbers by the last season, so I didn't want to be involved in it.
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  And Jesse used to be concerned about vaccines, used to be aware of things.
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  Over the years, especially Trump made him really flip out and just really joined the Democrats.
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  So that's nothing against Ventura.
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  He came out recently and said, you need to take the shot. We need to make everybody take the shot.
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:57.000]  And I just don't think his elevator goes all the way up now.
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  I understand. I just wondered if you might reach out to him because, you know, he was working with RT, and that's what turned me off about him also.
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  I mean, he's the one who broke that episode with Dr. Rima Labo that you really gave him the lead to.
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  And she flew in from Mexico, I remember.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:19.000]  Well, I did quarterback that episode, a couple others I basically wrote most of it.
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  The one on FEMA camps was 80% me.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:28.000]  And it was great, reached a lot of people, so it's a lot of work we've done. And now that stuff is evergreen, John.
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  Well, I just wondered though, I mean, you know, if you may have a personal talk with him sometime and ask what really changed his mind about, you know, the vaccines when he should already know that, you know, ahead that they were dangerous.
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  This was actually what Rima Labo talked about in that one episode.
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  And now, all of a sudden, he just was a sellout, but I just wondered if you might reach out to him and just see what, you know, may have changed his mind about the vaccines.
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  You know, I almost thought about a month ago or so, or two months ago when I saw that clip of him.
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  Guys, see, you can pull it up. It was like, Jesse Ventura says forced injections are good or everybody's, or you're dumb if you don't take it.
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  It was something like that. I don't want to misconstrued what my memory remembers, but it's pretty crazy.
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  Thank you so much, John. Good point.
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  All right. Up next here is Alex. Alex in California. Go ahead.
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  I've been a fan of yours for a long time. This was my first time actually getting through to you.
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  But I have a couple of points that I want to make that are bothering me beyond belief and that it's going to lead to a question I have for you.
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  But at first I'm going to mention your products.
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  Ever since I was young, I'm exactly your age and whatever since I was young, I did all the nutritional supplements and the weight gainers and stuff.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  But I stopped after a while because most of it didn't work.
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  But I think back when you had Dr. Walik on, I think the first thing I forgot was the Alex pack or something.
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  Ever since then, I've been getting all of your products and I really appreciate him because it's the best prices out there and the highest quality products.
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  And pretty much everything I take, I can feel the difference with.
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  We can put crap fillers out or use stuff that certifies us or that, but isn't really concentrated.
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  Everything we sell is the very best we can find.
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  Well, and it absolutely works. So anybody interested in excellent health, they should absolutely be on your website buying stuff.
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  So anyway, the first thing that I want to mention is the 2020 elections.
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  I mean, every single day I hear people mention President Joe Biden and it just makes me sick because, I mean, we basically watch the Democrats tell us straight off that no matter what the results were, that they were going to basically kick them out.
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  And that's exactly what they did.
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  And I just can't believe that they actually walked out there and got him out of the White House and stuck Joe Biden in there.
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  And we're all just standing around calling him President Joe Biden.
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  That part, I can't get past.
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  And I think until we fix that, I mean, I don't know how we fix the country or how we do anything until we deal with that part.
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  And then in that least in my second thing, which is the whole January six situation, I mean, we had all these beautiful Americans come together doing exactly what we're supposed to do.
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  And stand up for our rights in our country.
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  And we basically got hijacked.
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  And the whole thing, I mean, we've got these Americans in a gulag basically.
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  And we have President Trump.
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:18.000]  We have the status.
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  We have all these great patriots.
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  And nobody can do anything to get justice or due process.
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  And now they've announced all over the news, I got a stack of articles right here just came out today that they want to start grabbing more people and people that it organized the peaceful ellipse rally that the Democrats want them arrested.
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  Here's some of the articles.
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  Justice Department investigation of January six confront sprawling cast of characters.
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  Of course, I'm in there and it goes on Capitol attack investigators zero in on far right oathkeepers and proud boys and says it's now focusing on my communications with the what like having them on the air a couple times.
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  And it just goes on from there to all of us, you know, basically they're demoralizing us and letting us know that, you know, we're coming for you.
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:15.000]  And with all the documentation that you see coming out of the White House, you know, declaring your everyday American as an enemy of the state, basically, I mean, I mean, that freaks me out beyond.
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  I mean, I literally do get the chills up my spine and my hair stands up.
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  I'm thinking what the hell is looking over my shoulder saying what's going on here.
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  I can't even and being in California, it's easy to be demoralized, obviously, because every corner you turn, you've got corners of neighborhoods being taken over by homeless people, all this stuff.
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  I mean, they're taxing us beyond belief and the roads are busted.
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  We're like 1950s technology here.
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  You know, you go you go anywhere, you know, San Francisco LA anywhere in between.
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  And basically, you know, you pay all the bills, you know, as a middle class person, you have no rights, but all these people can sit in front of your house, they could go to the bathroom on the street.
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  I mean, I can't tell you how many times I've been out with my girlfriend places and I've seen people literally, you know, drop a due somewhere.
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  That is total dehumanization on record.
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  They're admitted plan.
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  It's all declassified.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  And we're just sitting here watching them do it to us.
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  All right, we're going to come back and go right back to your phone calls and the order that they have been received up next is dawn and then laying and others.
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  And then we have a special guest joining us who got damaged by the so called cupboard vaccine that is really a deadly gene therapy.
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  So that guest is going to be joining us coming up above the hour, but your call straight ahead on the other side of the spring talking about products.

[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  You got all these fake news articles out there that I got $10 million don't have that.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:47.000]  I got $20 million don't have that.
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  I got a hundred million don't have that.
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  I don't have that.

[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  The XQ does wonders.
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  They recommend it to everybody.
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  You're on the fence about it.
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  Get off the fence.

[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  Awesome.
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:42.000]  So first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products.

[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:49.000]  It helps in the bedroom.

[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:24.000]  It's the young Jones show and I really appreciate you all being part of it.
[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  Don in Minnesota you're on the air welcome.
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  Don welcome sir go ahead.
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:37.000]  Don you hear me?
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  Oh hold on.
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:40.000]  All right.
[2:20:40.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  Hey Don you still there?
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:43.000]  All right go ahead and let down.
[2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:44.000]  Can you hear me now?
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:45.000]  Yeah I sure can Don.
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:47.000]  Oh perfect sorry.
[2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:51.000]  Yeah I've been listening to you for quite a while.
[2:20:51.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  One of your previous callers mentioned the last governor, the governor of Minnesota here
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  where I'm located, Jesse Ventura.
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  That's around the time I started listening to you too and the Obama deception.
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  Fantastic film there.
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:18.000]  I've been taking your iodine for many months now and I realized how depleted I was and
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:20.000]  till after about a few weeks that really kicked in.
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:22.000]  I was like whoa should have been taking this a while ago.
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  Oh yeah.
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  I just recently started taking the brain force ultra.
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  My problem with that is I've developed a strong liking for the taste and I am pretty
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:37.000]  much drinking it from the bottle now.
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  Probably not a good idea.
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:41.000]  I really love brain force ultra it works good.
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:43.000]  Yeah and it tastes good too.
[2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  Kind of strange.
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:48.000]  Yeah big fan of yours.
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:51.000]  The Putin thing.
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  Putin everybody is talking about how he's losing and it's not going very well for him.
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  That's not part of his plan.
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  If he's been planning this for years and years, 15 plus years, he's not just going to go in
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  there.
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:13.000]  He doesn't play a regular chess bet.
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:16.000]  He's on a much grander chess bet.
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:20.000]  He might be a mad man maybe but he's not a moron.
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  He's look at the equipment they're throwing in there.
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:29.000]  Those tanks and all the armor is just old, old and rusty, barely even running.
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  Yeah that's to get all the western weapons that are cast to shoot those up so the more
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:35.000]  high tech stuff doesn't get destroyed.
[2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:37.000]  Yeah that's the fact I've been saying this since day one.
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  He wants to drive up the rubble and force folks away from the dollar which is happening.
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:44.000]  But I would say the Ukrainians have been putting up a pretty big fight.
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:46.000]  The whole thing's bad news for America.
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:48.000]  I wish it would end.
[2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  Well here's the thing Alex.
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  He doesn't care about these conscripts or that old equipment.
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  He's using Ukraine as a training ground.
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  The ones that come back, the soldiers are now soldiers of war for a potentially much larger in the near future.
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  Well there's no doubt that the U.S. has called Vietnam a war game and Korea a war game.
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  And the Pentagon does these little wars to test their weapons so you're right.
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  Russia has used Syria as a war game.
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  Now they've gone to a much bigger theater, Ukraine.
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:25.000]  So definitely that is what Putin is doing.
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  Many nations including the U.S. has always done that through war.
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:32.000]  It's to keep the military trained.
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:43.000]  Trained for other conflicts in the future because if a military goes without being in any conflict for years, decades, whatever, none of them have any experience.
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  No that's right Don, you're dead on.
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:46.000]  Thank you so much for the call.
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  Lang in Alabama, Lang, you're on the air.
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  This is my first time caller.
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:54.000]  Welcome.
[2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  And I've been listening to you since the mid to late 90s.
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  Wow good to have you on board.
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  You've been listening 25 years.
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  Again I'm a little older than you are.
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  Good to have you on board brother God bless you.
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  Well let me tell you what I was looking at.
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  And somebody needs to get it out because nobody looks at these things.
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  But I was looking at Fitton's latest release of information in regard to the different things that came out of the resettlement of refugees and everything.
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  I was looking at the clinical notes and in the clinical notes I noticed this ORR core or ORR care.
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  Now I'm going to give you a website that you really need to go to is ACF.HHS.gov.
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  And it will tell you how all of these people and it even has a United States map on it you can click on.
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  And it will tell you which NGO that these immigrants or which essentially they're calling refugees illegal immigrants is that.
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  And how they can access state by state and find all the NGOs that will help them.
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  That's right the UN is bringing all these people in and hook them up with NGOs inside the country.
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  Oh yes I mean it's all being done by that.
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  But my main thing was while I was doing this because I'm in the middle of writing a book.
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  And I ran up on some national security memos.
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  There's a memorandum on revitalizing Americans foreign policy and national security workforce institutions and partnerships.
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  This was released back in February the 4th of 2021 along with three other memorandums.
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  Now in this memorandum it's essentially to revitalize national security and foreign policy institutions and values accelerating.
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  You know love this domestic renewal.
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  Now why would you be doing something with national security on policy institution foreign policy institution and values to renew the domestic.
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  Essentially it's implementing foreign policy for the middle class in America and it says it in the damn memorandum.
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  Which the UN calls a unionization.
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  Remember like 10 years ago they couldn't get the carbon tax pass so Schwarzenegger became the head UN delegate to go to the cities and get the cities.
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  And counties implement the UN treaties outside of the states or federal government.
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  So that's exactly what you're talking about.
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  The committee is made up of the following departments.
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:54.000]  The Department of State Department of Transportation Department of Defense Department of Justice Department of Commerce Department of Energy Department of Human Services Department of Homeland Security
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:27:15.000]  Director of National Intelligence CIA and the VA and the policy on engagement partnerships says that national security and foreign policy goals is to implement foreign policy on domestic America and partner with state and local governments.
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  That's right they're leveraging their outside like Obama signed executive order while he was still president when Trump was president elect with billions of dollars to quote counter disinformation and then put his operatives using international money to actually target Americans.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  With using state local governments academic research institutions the private sector NGOs and civil society.
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:45.000]  Essentially it's foreign policy for the American middle classes destruction and control.
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:51.000]  And Alex Americans especially the middle class is being attacked from all directions.
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  Well that's why they're God bless you.
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  That's why they're all the power plants off open on the borders attacking our children.
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  You said it's all the big UN world government takeover plan.
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  God bless you.
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  First they seize the federal government and even they don't have control of the Congress the executive branch links up with the states and cities they control to get their agenda through.
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  We're going to break.
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  We're going to calls in the order received Elizabeth up next and Lorenzo and John I'll get to you all but I got a special guest popping in for like a segment and a half.
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  I'll go back to your phone calls.
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  This is an article we posted a few days ago.
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  Vaccine harm.
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  Man describes losing leg every AstraZeneca jab.
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  Alex Mitchell joining us on the other side of this quick break to talk about this because we can talk about the statistics all day and the facts but to hear from an individual.
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  What happened is very, very important.
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  I know a lot of people personally that didn't listen to the shot and got very serious blood clots and some that died.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  We'll be talking to him on the other side.
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  Please remember we don't receive him for wars dot com.
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  We have band dot video band dot video and news wars dot com.
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:29:09.000]  We'll be right back want to thank folks that got part one in the three part founder series at 1776 coin dot com or info or store dot com and the second installment is the tree of liberty.
[2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:13.000]  Thomas Jefferson quote must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:14.000]  It's a coin I designed.
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:18.000]  I'm very proud of it and it will end up being a collectible.
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:24.000]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what we sold it.
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly and I appreciate listeners getting over half of them now.
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:33.000]  I'd like to lose them out very quickly.
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:36.000]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days.
[2:29:36.000 --> 2:29:41.000]  And without the last coin sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:43.000]  We have had to lay off a lot of people and had some big problems.
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:50.000]  So it was a limited edition collectible tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom and it's needed for infrastructure and building new systems.
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:30:02.000]  So please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the new order at 1776 coin dot com introducing the newest product from info wars life dot com.
[2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:05.000]  We are so proud of him for his life immune support.

[2:30:19.000 --> 2:30:21.000]  So that's the 360 win.
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:23.000]  Let me tell you what is in this amazing product.

[2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:34.000]  This product is incredible.
[2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:42.000]  Info wars immune support exclusively available at info wars store dot com is funding the tip of the spear, the info wars operation.
[2:30:42.000 --> 2:30:44.000]  It is a 360 win.
[2:30:44.000 --> 2:30:51.000]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's natural defenses and keep info wars on the air.
[2:30:51.000 --> 2:30:53.000]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[2:30:53.000 --> 2:30:56.000]  Take action now info wars store dot com.
[2:30:56.000 --> 2:31:06.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, info wars store dot com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[2:31:06.000 --> 2:31:13.000]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains have broken down.
[2:31:13.000 --> 2:31:18.000]  And info wars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for operations.
[2:31:18.000 --> 2:31:23.000]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making their main move.
[2:31:23.000 --> 2:31:27.000]  Info wars, its paradoxical is more popular than ever.
[2:31:27.000 --> 2:31:30.000]  It is reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[2:31:30.000 --> 2:31:37.000]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own band with everything else, we are running out of money.
[2:31:37.000 --> 2:31:46.000]  So listen up to 75% off at info wars store dot com on things like amazing patriot t-shirts that help spread the word and fund the operation.
[2:31:46.000 --> 2:31:49.000]  On supplements, on books, on films.

[2:31:55.000 --> 2:32:21.000]  Thank you for your support.
[2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:47.000]  Thank you.
[2:32:47.000 --> 2:32:51.000]  It's that simple. They can't beat us because of our free speech and our guns.
[2:32:51.000 --> 2:32:55.000]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[2:32:55.000 --> 2:33:20.000]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[2:33:20.000 --> 2:33:25.000]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[2:33:25.000 --> 2:33:31.000]  We got some very exciting positive news breaking next segment but we're just now getting it in.
[2:33:31.000 --> 2:33:35.000]  I need to be able to scan it next segment before I cover it all. This is some very positive news.
[2:33:35.000 --> 2:33:44.000]  We're about to have a special guest pop in but I wanted to play a short clip of this Kelly McBreen article about Project Veritas that's live on the vaunted info wars dot com.
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:54.000]  Only way this dog hunts is you let it out of the cage so release the kraken. Project Veritas confronts Hillary Clinton over ties to disgrace dim operative.
[2:33:54.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  Here it is.
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:34:15.000]  I just want to say thank you for elevating black voices before it was full. I just want to ask I'm Shirley teeter. She was recently ordered to pay Project Veritas legal expenses.
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  You're a good friend Bob Cramer.
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:45.000]  I don't know Bob Cramer.
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  It was unbelievable what we had Clinton with everything.
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  And we are back ladies and gentlemen taking your phone calls. We line that guest up. Let's go ahead and talk to Elizabeth in Ohio. Elizabeth you're on the air.
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:34.000]  I just wanted to thank you for taking my call and I wanted to thank you so much for everything that you do. I'm a born again Christian and I pray for you and your family every day.
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  And I am totally awake to what's going on. I'm a registered nurse. I got out of the hospital. I worked with the critically care. It was critical care nursing with the COVID patients. It was one step before the ICU.
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:36:04.000]  And I saw how awful everything it was just it was like a battlefield like four people a day were dying on my shift. You know I saw how the doctors were doing nothing for these people.
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:12.000]  So I I ultimately do want to go to healthcare because it's completely falling apart but I work on night shift at different nursing homes.
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  And I'm constantly just like listening to all these different podcasts because there's so much downtime. And you know I talked to my fellow coworkers about what's going on and they're like taking notes like writing down Clashwap's name saying they're going to look into this.
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  And like you know totally everybody's waking up and you know I have different ranges of emotions all the time like angry sad you know whatever about what's going on it's just so intense but you know it just I just want to say a few hopeful things about you know people are
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:54.000]  waking up and you know Joe Biden brought up the other day about the fourth turning.
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:59.000]  Am I on the air.
[2:36:59.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  Hello.
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  No I'm listening to you said Joe brought and brought.
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  Okay I'm sorry I'm sorry I came out with so many words at once I just wanted to make sure you were there.
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  I'm sorry I'm a first time I've never talked to anybody on a radio show.
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  Hey I love the fact you're there waking people up at the hospital where you work and people are so ready for the truth right now.
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  Everything is so true so true people think of like these big complex things we've got to do to beat the globalist all we've got to do is word of mouth expose their program and who they are and it's game over and you're doing it.
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:40.000]  I decided that was the only thing that I could do presently to help the situation was to wake people up and people really are waking up and Joe Biden brought up the other day the fourth turning which I had looked into that about four years ago.
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  But I just wanted to say so the book the fourth turning by how and straw straw they went back like 500 years and there's a cycle every 100 years.
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:38:07.000]  Well the current cycle if it follows what's happened the previous 500 years if it's the millennials are going to they're going to tear down everything the baby boomers have done and rebuild society.
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  And that's the pattern that's happened for the last 500 years.
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  And the globalists know that's coming so they've hijacked it to create an artificial revolution of post human.
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:23.000]  Eugenics out of it instead of us having our revolution restoring humanity the right path.
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  Yeah but I just started to have hope and I know they're aware of it but you know it's not up to the baby boomers for this new world order.
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  It's up to us millennials and if you go and you look I looked it up the other day.
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  It said millennials are on average are more conservative at that because you know you become more conservative as you get older.
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  It said millennials are more conservative at the current age and compared to Generation X and the baby boomers.
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  Absolutely thank you so much for the call.
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:03.000]  Thank you so much. Let's talk to Lorenzo in Chicago. Welcome Lorenzo.
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:06.000]  Hi Alex how's everybody doing.
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:12.000]  Man I'm tired. It's it's crazy stuff's wild. It's just incredible to have it all out in the open now. It's really crazy.
[2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:18.000]  I hear you Alex I'm going to be as fast as I can. I have a few comments and just a few questions hit us brother.
[2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:30.000]  Okay really quick 10 years ago I was in on business in Hunt County Greenville Texas. I saw a guy with a in four wars bumper sticker asked about it.
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:33.000]  The rest is history. I've been on fire ever since.
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:41.000]  Just then I discovered your supplements and your guests like Mike Adams I wish you'd have him on a little bit more often.
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  We'd have him on as much as he wants to come on.
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:48.000]  He's awesome. All you guys are awesome especially your crew.
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  Really quick I want to share with you what I do to get the word out Alex.
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:40:04.000]  In my vehicle I keep a a roll of masking tape with a with a sharpie marker when I'm at the gas station I write a different message every time.
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  Basically I'll write pandemic the population kill shot in four wars dot com band video put it on I put it on the gas pump stop signs.
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:24.000]  Maybe something you know your listeners can do because our our resources are limited and I'm asking tape is cheap and I'm not defacing property it's even easy to tear off you know what I mean.
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  Hey brother they're killing babies and mass shopping children's genitals off you know we're involved in civil disobedience now as long as we don't hurt somebody just get out there and get it done.
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  It's not graffiti we're not defacing property.
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:38.000]  No I agree. I totally agree with what you're saying.
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  A few questions regarding Hunter Biden's laptop OK.
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  Alex what info is going to do the most damage to the Bidens and the Democrats will it be the Chinese collusion.
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:54.000]  Well I mean the public is punched down to all the pedophilia which is definitely in there and that's important to head on.
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  But him saying I'm under the command of the top Chinese communist.
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:06.000]  And now he's been disappeared and they're coming after me and I'm so scared the FBI is coming to my house.
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:11.000]  You know I work for my dad. I mean I'm sure you've heard that audio right.
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  I have.
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  We should probably play it more. I mean here's the deal.
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  I would not look at the laptop because I've never seen child porn.
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:30.000]  I've only seen by accident you know a woman getting attacked by a sexual horse and I've seen by accident somebody goes look at this and it was like women eating poo and I can never get out of my head.
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  And I've got a goal in life to never see child porn.
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  And so I've never seen it so I would not go on there and look at it as a journalist you can go look at it if it's if it's on the laptop but I still would not do it.
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  Major journalist groups have done it. It's come out and it's just he had child porn child porn he shot himself torturing women just sex with family members but that's just one part of it.
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  And then there's all the cocaine and the crack and all of it and then there's all the money laundering for his dad and the Chinese communists running him.
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:10.000]  Exactly. That's why I was asking which one is going to do the most damage. Hopefully all of it.
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:14.000]  I have one more question Alex regarding Trump.
[2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  I've seen the footage of him shaking hands with Paula Schwab. I've seen the footage of him on stage with Bill O'Reilly openly bragging taking responsibility for the MRNA gene therapy how it's so good that he's been jabbed that he's been boosted.
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:34.000]  Then I've seen the crowd the crowd how they booed him and he kind of mocked them saying oh that's just a small minority.
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:36.000]  Now here's my question Alex.
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  If Trump is is reelected. What are his many priorities going to be and let me just ask you straight out. Can we trust him or is Trump a globalist. I want to know.
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  You know we should do a whole call in show and I said I started doing these a few weeks ago but I haven't been so busy.
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:55.000]  We're starting a few week night shows and more like three hour commercial free calls.
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:42:58.000]  That'd be a topic.
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:06.000]  We are only offering three coins in the series. The first coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days.
[2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:14.000]  Now the second coin as we enter the last days of March into April 2022 is now being offered.
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:25.000]  I believe it will sell out in just a few days again because these are historic coins and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep info wars at the front lines of the fight against these tyrants.
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:33.000]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty Tree coin.
[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  It is powerful.
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  Witness this powerful iconography for yourself and have this piece of history and be part of the founding member system that we're set to launch in the very near future thanks to your support of this project.
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:58.000]  Get a historic memento that helps keep info wars on the air and also gives you a real piece of history at 1776coin.com.
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:04.000]  It has been noted by many a historian the first casualty of war is the truth.
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:19.000]  Then the next big casualty isn't even the people that died. No, that invariably follows. But first there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and massive censorship.
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  And now across the world from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced that if you amplify any quote pro Russian information, you can be censored, you can be arrested, you can be a prisoner.
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:49.000]  And of course now Canada is under this legislation that if you have a fought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online, that you will be censored and arrested.
[2:44:49.000 --> 2:44:58.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes info wars dot com more important than ever.
[2:44:58.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  April 2022 just kicked off and it's already been incredible.
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:15.000]  The Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, Joe Biden, they along with many other new order operatives have gone on national television and announced that we are now under a world government.
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:23.000]  They have a summit taking place right now in Dubai titled World Government Summit and they are announcing incredible tyranny.
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:28.000]  Everything we've talked about is now coming true and the globalists want to take us off air.
[2:45:28.000 --> 2:45:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running the biggest sale in the history of info wars right now in our 28 years.
[2:45:35.000 --> 2:45:45.000]  All info wars apparel is being sold at cost until the inventory is gone and we're never going to print these t-shirts and ball caps and info wars flags again.
[2:45:45.000 --> 2:45:48.000]  We may have t-shirts and apparel in the future, but I don't even know.
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:51.000]  We are blowing out of everything to get emergency funds in right now.
[2:45:51.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  I'm firing the bat signal and asking you to get your t-shirts at infowarstore.com right now. They're at cost.
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:31.000]  We're running close to 10 million views a day. We're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:35.000]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[2:46:35.000 --> 2:46:41.000]  Info wars and Bandai video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide.
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:48.000]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:58.000]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now, the mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off, getting incredible products and keep info wars as strong as ever.
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:18.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:35.000]  Well, we got some big news breaking before we take a few final calls here.
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:39.000]  Hand the baton of the next guest host here on the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:43.000]  This is out of the major Channel 4 news out of Detroit, Michigan.
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:45.000]  This just happened in the last 15 minutes.
[2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  Two acquitted mistrial declared for two others in Whitmer kidnapping plot where a whole group of FBI agents and FBI and
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  formers and assets led these individuals in what they believed was an attack on her house and to kidnap her and kill her.
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:11.000]  But it turns out in the audio recordings that the FBI is basically ordering them to attack.
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  They're like, I don't want to, I don't want to do it.
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  I don't want to go there.
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:16.000]  And who was the FBI agent?
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  And Governor Whitmer kidnapped plot, who was running it, a guy that then got arrested beating up his wife to a bloody pulp after,
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:27.000]  I guess, something bad happened at a Swinger Club.
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  So that's the type of folks they got hired.
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  And this was a beta test.
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  So the FBI agents that ran that whole fake synthetic plot, they then all moved on over to January 6th a few months later.
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:44.000]  And that's why that's such a nightmare situation.
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  It doesn't mean there weren't real people that went in.
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:48.000]  It doesn't mean some of them didn't attack police, which is wrong.
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  A lot of folks believe that Q was ordering them to do it and other groups.
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  I had no idea that Oathkeepers and Proud Boys and some of those groups supposedly worked together to breach the Capitol.
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:02.000]  That's in the indictments, but they lie so much.
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  I don't know if that's true.
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  I mean, did the Oathkeepers beat anybody up?
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  Did they kidnap anybody?
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:09.000]  No.
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  How many times did Democrats break into capitals or force their ways in?
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  And again, I'm not defending any of it.
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  I'm just saying we got to really, really, really, really, really be skeptical of all of this.
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:23.000]  A jury in the trial against four men charged,
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:26.000]  applied to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer,
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:28.000]  have returned a mixed verdict.
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:34.000]  The judge found Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta not guilty of all charges
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  and were unable to reach a verdict in the charges against Adam Fox and Barry Croft resulting in a mistrial.
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:45.000]  The verdict was read in federal court in Grand Rapids on Friday afternoon.
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  The jury started deliberations on Monday.
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:50.000]  You know, the feds used to have a 96% conviction rate.
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  They don't on January 6 and related stuff like this.
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:57.000]  It's more like 75% for what I've seen.
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:50:03.000]  Because, you know, if somebody's guilty, you're not open and shut, then charge them and put them in prison.
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  They went out and created the group.
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  Just like they did with Atari militia a decade before.
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  There's a lot, just like you can get Hispanic youth, black youth, white youth, mixed youth, Asian youth,
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  who don't have fathers, you can get them when they're 10, 11, 12,
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  make them feel important, do a little errands and stuff,
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:29.000]  and then next they're dealing drugs, next they're killing people by the time they're 14.
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  And you got a lot of these fatherless men want to be in a militia,
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:34.000]  want to feel like they're part of something special,
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  and they get recruited by FBI agents that know how to manipulate them, and this was their leader, this FBI agent.
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  When it's off time, reportedly, beats his wife after death.
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  Hey, dude, if you're taking your wife to swing her clubs and get mad that she's liking it, that's your problem.
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:55.000]  So, I guess he didn't like the cucking or whatever, but no excuse to beat up a woman.
[2:50:55.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  So, that's the type of weirdness we're dealing with, and the FBI is destroying itself with this type of behavior.
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:06.000]  I believe we need a federal investigative body in this country.
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:12.000]  But it doesn't need to be run by people like this with a new world order agenda.
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:15.000]  And it's just killing our country.
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  All right, I'm going to jam in John in California,
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:26.000]  and we're going to go to break and come back and kick off the fourth hour with the amazing J. Dyer.
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:30.000]  And by the way, J. Dyer is a great historian and researcher and best-selling author,
[2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  but man, did he knock it out of the park last week.
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:36.000]  I did some work in my office and ate lunch and watched him in the fourth hour,
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:40.000]  and it was just, actually, that was the week before I watched him in my office.
[2:51:40.000 --> 2:51:45.000]  I was actually at night on the road somewhere, and I watched the poem.
[2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:53.000]  I watched his elite plan to kill everyone, titled Our, and it was just bam, bam, bam,
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:55.000]  with just quote, quote, here's the book.
[2:51:55.000 --> 2:51:56.000]  Here's where they said it.
[2:51:56.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  Here's the white paper.
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:51:58.000]  Here's where to find it.
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  And he digs up stuff I didn't even know about, which I know about a lot of stuff,
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:05.000]  and you watch J. Dyer, you learn about a lot of stuff that I didn't know,
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:07.000]  and probably you didn't know either.
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:13.000]  So it's definitely a very important list, and that is coming up at the start of the next hour with J. Dyer.
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:15.000]  Right now, let's go to John in California.
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  John, you're on the air.
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:19.000]  Can you talk to me?
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:21.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:28.000]  You know, as a man of God and a man of faith, I'm inspired by you and all the other people,
[2:52:28.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  all the other info warriors who are out there just speaking the words, speaking the truth of God.
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:40.000]  And then by doing that, it dispels all their lies, and it's just so amazing how it works.
[2:52:40.000 --> 2:52:42.000]  It's just like God is on our side.
[2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:43.000]  There is no defeating us.
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:45.000]  We shall be victorious.
[2:52:45.000 --> 2:52:47.000]  It's truly amazing.
[2:52:47.000 --> 2:52:53.000]  And it's just a blessing to be able to talk to you and to know that there's other warriors of peace out there.
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  Well, it's good to talk to you. John, what else is on your mind?
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:53:03.000]  Oh, I'm just, you know, I get a little discouraged when I hear about all the stuff going on.
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:14.000]  But then, you know, I'm just lifted up, lifted up by God to just go out there and to help others who are like lost in the fog.
[2:53:14.000 --> 2:53:18.000]  They're lost in the fog of deceit, and they don't know where they are, you know.
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:28.000]  And as we reveal that truth to them, we can like give them that compass, that compass of faith that helped them and guide them through all this madness, you know.
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:30.000]  Absolutely, brother.
[2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:32.000]  And that's why they want to stamp out God.
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:35.000]  They want people to stamp out having any faith.
[2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:38.000]  They don't want you to know that there's more power out there than just us.
[2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:44.000]  We believe there's a government, and corporations, and corrupt groups that we're all along, but we're not. We have God, brother.
[2:53:44.000 --> 2:53:45.000]  Preach it. Anything else?
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:49.000]  Yes, Alex, I was trying to get another founding member coin.
[2:53:49.000 --> 2:53:54.000]  And if you could put me on hold so I could talk to one of your crew and help me out getting that, I would appreciate it.
[2:53:54.000 --> 2:53:59.000]  I bought your first one and all your other products, but I can't get it home in the second one, please.
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:04.000]  So when you go to 1776coin.com, it's not letting you process the order?
[2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:10.000]  No, it's not or on your site either, and I've been kind of dumbfounded by it. I can't get through.
[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:12.000]  What happens when you go to try to buy it?
[2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:17.000]  It just goes, it says site not available. It's not going to the site.
[2:54:17.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  Hey, guys, pull up 1776coin.com on screen. Just type it in yourself.
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:32.000]  1776coin.com. So that's 1176, or 1776, 1776coin.com.
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:35.000]  And you're saying you can't see that?
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:41.000]  No, it's the site unavailable. It's been saying that for days, and I've been just like trying to get the second coin.
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:44.000]  Well, patreoncollectibles.com, does that get you there?
[2:54:44.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  That doesn't go through either.
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:48.000]  Crazy, man.
[2:54:48.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  All right, let's put John on hold and give me his name and number, and I'll hand it over to the customer service folks to get him on the line and get it.
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:54:58.000]  And yeah, folks, there's a substantive markup on the coin.
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:04.000]  I mean, these coins cost us 40-something bucks to do each one, and then it's got the markup there because we don't have the funds we're going to shut down.
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:08.000]  And believe me, I'm not trying to impress you. I'm not trying to scare you.
[2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:15.000]  We're on empty. We're on fumes. I'm just trusting God's going to come through with everything we're up against and all the attacks and legal fees.
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:19.000]  I do not want to start downsizing because everybody we've got here, we need.
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  So I need you to go to 1776coin.com and get the final coins.
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:28.000]  I need you to go get things you need by DNA Force Plus at infowarstore.com.
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:36.000]  And things like our new concentrated immune support with all the key herbs and compounds for your immune system now in stock in all of it.
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:41.000]  It's at infowarstore.com or by calling toll 3-888-253-3139.
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:49.000]  I hate to sit there and lean on the listeners and stuff, but we're not funded by George Soros, the globalist, and we're paying for a massive bandwidth because we're reaching so many people.
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  Nobody else has basically been taken off because nobody has their own servers or own systems.
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:56:00.000]  We're here up to 10 million people a day still able to get our videos and websites and information off our site.
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  We see where it's magnified and we're estimating it's about 10 million a day right now, despite all the bans, all the demonization.
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:11.000]  And people are more ready and more hungry for the truth than they've ever been, ever.
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:20.000]  All right, great job with the crew. I'll be back Sunday, Lord willing, 4-6 p.m. and then there'll be the Sunday live, 6-8 p.m. and then back Monday.
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:26.000]  We got the War Room today, 3 p.m. central. That's coming up in an hour and four minutes from now.
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:28.000]  I believe Christy Lee's hosting today.
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  So look for the War Room. She's a great job, by the way.
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:34.000]  Never really did live radio or TV, but she's just like a fish to water.
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  And so she's really kicking butt there.
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:42.000]  Owen is on a well-deserved visit to family up in St. Louis, Missouri, where he's from. I haven't seen him in a year.
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:50.000]  Because he's not allowed to travel. He has to get special permission from his probation officer while he's under indictment for being outside the Capitol peacefully.
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:55.000]  He's a very... It's Harrison today. OK, I saw her earlier this week. Harrison does another stupendous job.
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:59.000]  How about burning the candle at both ends? Didn't he host The Morning Show as well?
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  Which he hosts is American Journal.
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:06.000]  So these are real original Americana transmissions, served out worldwide. People are hungry for this.
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:14.000]  So I want to thank you all for your support. And I want to encourage you to understand, finally, that we are selling out of the 200-plus designs of t-shirts we had,
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:18.000]  many of which I ordered, never promoted, that just sat there. A lot of them are great designs. Some are OK designs.
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:21.000]  The point is, it funds the operation. They're historic. They're limited edition.
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:23.000]  And we're never going to print them again.
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:26.000]  Infowarsstore.com, selling out the t-shirts at cost.
[2:57:26.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  Another critical thing you can do to keep us on air.
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:32.000]  And I want to thank you all, and the crew, thanks you as well, because they want to stay in the fight.
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  My crew is great. They can get jobs elsewhere and put up with less. But let me tell you, they love staying in the fight, and we love them for doing that.
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:43.000]  That's it for my part of the transmission. J. Dyer takes over in T-minus 120 seconds.
[2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:56.000]  In December of 2021, Infowars offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776 Anti-Tyrant Coin.
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:58:07.000]  And it sold out in 10 days. And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin, a founding member coin, we would not be on air today.
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:14.000]  Now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin, is being offered, and it will probably sell out in 10 days again.
[2:58:14.000 --> 2:58:19.000]  It certainly needs to be front of operation. It is so historic.
[2:58:19.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  And it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty being refreshed with the blood of Patriots in Tyrants and more.
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:34.000]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com. It's also at infowarstore.com. It's amazing. There's only 10,000 of them.
[2:58:34.000 --> 2:58:42.000]  And as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air, we're planning something very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.
[2:58:42.000 --> 2:58:47.000]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[2:58:47.000 --> 2:58:56.000]  You know, it's a fact, and I'm out bragging when I say it, it's just true, that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty.
[2:58:56.000 --> 2:59:04.000]  As the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[2:59:04.000 --> 2:59:12.000]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:19.000]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at infowarstore.com.
[2:59:19.000 --> 2:59:22.000]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you.
[2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:30.000]  And so now we need to support more than ever because this fight has intensified. Don't need me to tell you that at infowarstore.com.
[2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:34.000]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[2:59:34.000 --> 2:59:43.000]  Things have been sold out for a long time like info wars life, fizzy magnesium mix that's so amazing, and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[2:59:43.000 --> 2:59:48.000]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at infowarstore.com right now.
[2:59:48.000 --> 2:59:55.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:00:02.000 --> 3:00:06.000]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host J. Dyer of jasonalsis.com.
[3:00:06.000 --> 3:00:12.000]  Last week we had a really in-depth talk about Bertrand Russell's book, The Scientific Outlook.
[3:00:12.000 --> 3:00:22.000]  And I mentioned a couple times in that talk another pretty wild text that he wrote a few decades later called The Impact of Science on Society.
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:29.000]  And since we haven't lectured through that entire book, I thought we would just go ahead and point out that his views didn't change over the next 20 years.
[3:00:29.000 --> 3:00:33.000]  And in fact, he took an even more real stance if you can believe it.
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:38.000]  I mean, I know we on the last through that it was pretty wild. It was pretty crazy.
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:42.000]  But where did he end up years later after World War II?
[3:00:42.000 --> 3:00:48.000]  What did he think would be the, quote, impact of science on society be? What would it be?
[3:00:48.000 --> 3:00:54.000]  Well, remember that we saw last week that Russell is a proponent of scientism.
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:01:04.000]  Scientism is a faith-based worldview where we have no real proof of the external world, the scientific method of all these philosophy principles that underlie science.
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:10.000]  But we're going to ignore all that and just do science for the sake of science in the sense of will to power.
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:18.000]  Now, this is odd because Russell presented himself as an advocate of liberalism, as an advocate of democracy.
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:26.000]  But if you don't know, the Royal Society had, as we said last week, a front, a kind of cover group that was the Fabian Socialist,
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:38.000]  who presented a liberal democratic face to the people. Meanwhile, in the background, they were also part of the other side of the circle, the society, the elect, the inner party,
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:47.000]  that did not believe in anything remotely close to liberal values, democracy, or any of these catchphrases and slogans that they used.
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:57.000]  Russell is a proponent, as we said, of a radical depopulation agenda. And this book is very important because he explains how that will come about, potentially.
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:02:08.000]  So the book begins by discussing the notion that what happened in the Enlightenment and in the Darwinian Revolution is that the world was divested of meaning and purpose.
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:20.000]  There's nothing inherently in the world that has purpose. Purpose is something that humans construct as a kind of social construct, as they made up a subjective thing.
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:25.000]  It's not something that's discovered. Things don't have purpose, they just do what they do.
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:32.000]  So an acorn becoming a tree is just what it is. It's not a purpose that the acorn has within it.
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:39.000]  The rejection of all ancient and medieval and metaphysical ideas is something that Bertrand Russell says was crucial to the modern world.
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:44.000]  And clearly, that would also mean the rejection of the notion of any kind of God.
[3:02:44.000 --> 3:02:49.000]  So what's the new religion? Who are the patron saints of the new religion?
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  Well, it's the so-called scientist. Which is interesting, though, because he comes up with a sort of a hall of scientists series of saints.
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:03:06.000]  As we said last time, people like Galileo, Kepler, Darwin, which is weird because many of those people had theistic views as well.
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:10.000]  So they don't exactly fit this narrative of atheistic materialism that Russell believes in.
[3:03:10.000 --> 3:03:22.000]  But we'll set that aside because he says that really science is grounded in the observation of the world and coming to conclusions on the basis of those observations.
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:29.000]  And he doesn't have any values. So wait a minute. So science doesn't contain any notion of values, any notion of right and wrong.
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  He just describes what is the case and it's you figuring out how things work.
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:40.000]  But if science doesn't have any values and can't give us values, how are we going to have values in this world?
[3:03:40.000 --> 3:03:47.000]  Well, according to Russell, it's going to be the scientific elite that will also tell you the values.
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:53.000]  And so we come to ideas that come out of the same British Royal Society elites like mentham of utilitarianism.
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:04:05.000]  Utilitarianism usually goes along with these kinds of atheistic materialist philosophies because the idea is, well, I guess the best we could come up with is just just maximize everyone's pleasures.
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:12.000]  There's no real reason. There's no way that we know exactly what that means. How do we quantify pleasure?
[3:04:12.000 --> 3:04:17.000]  What are the pleasure points? Do you get 50 pleasure points and I get 20 pleasure points?
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:22.000]  And there were actually utilitarians who thought they could come up with a moral calculus.
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:30.000]  And so eventually it became evident. And by the way, Bentham is the same guy who was a PEDO and he came up with the idea of the panopticon.
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:39.000]  So the centralized surveillance system inside of a prison, which would be the model for total information awareness nowadays.
[3:04:39.000 --> 3:04:46.000]  And that's all going, it's all concomitant. All these things go together in terms of this ideology.
[3:04:46.000 --> 3:04:54.000]  So if we can't be managed and engineered in terms of self-surveillance, which is the purpose of the panopticon, how are we going to be managed?
[3:04:54.000 --> 3:05:23.000]  Well, ultimately, Russell comes.
[3:05:24.000 --> 3:05:33.000]  First Life Immune Support is a game changer. And everyone out there that wants to be healthy and wants to boost your natural defenses should get it today.

[3:06:00.000 --> 3:06:03.000]  Welcome back to The Out of the Zone. So I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[3:06:03.000 --> 3:06:11.000]  Jay's analysis, we were covering Bertrand Russell's book The Impact of Science on Society and his explanation of what the scientism worldview and religion is.
[3:06:11.000 --> 3:06:17.000]  And he immediately moves to the beginning as we were saying to this notion of how do we get values? What are we going to do for the future?
[3:06:17.000 --> 3:06:34.000]  Well, first and foremost, you need to understand Malthus. He says, Thomas Malthus is the guy who essentially gives us the quantification approach to the world and taking his economic theories and applying them to resource wars and population.
[3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:41.000]  What does that mean? Well, if there's limited resources, then we're all going to be fighting over the resources. That's the way this theory goes.
[3:06:41.000 --> 3:06:51.000]  So if there's too many people, then we got to cut down on the people, right? You've heard Sat Guru, this Guru going around on all the TV, the TV shows and talk shows and podcasts.
[3:06:51.000 --> 3:07:02.000]  And he says, there are too many people to reduce the carbon footprints. We must reduce the feats. Get rid of the feats, the people.
[3:07:02.000 --> 3:07:19.000]  So even the mainline gurus nowadays promote this exact same Malthusian worldview, which again was originally kind of an economic theory, but evolves into a theory connected to social Darwinism of whom Bertrand Russell is one of the most famous proponents.
[3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:33.000]  It's funny too, because Russell says early on in the first chapter that really we don't believe in egalitarianism. Darwinism disproves egalitarianism and remember that he has a fiercely racial view as a rabid eugenicist.
[3:07:33.000 --> 3:07:44.000]  So Russell, again, is not any kind of egalitarian. He even admits that in the first chapter, but he plays the part of a liberal humanitarian democracy proponent.
[3:07:44.000 --> 3:07:56.000]  And I can't, for the life of me, figure out why people don't understand this or can't figure it out. You know, the people in his circles are saying the Duke of Kent, remember him going on all the TV interviews.
[3:07:56.000 --> 3:08:07.000]  And he says, I want to come back as a virus and kill everybody in the interviews. And the woman interviewing him is like, but what exactly do you mean? What do you mean come back as a virus and kill everybody?
[3:08:07.000 --> 3:08:15.000]  And he says, well, can't you guess? Can't you guess what I mean? I mean, kill everybody. Come back as a virus and kill everybody. What exactly do you mean? What does it mean?
[3:08:15.000 --> 3:08:23.000]  What do you mean? What does it mean? He says what it means. All of these people say what they mean. Every one of them writes books saying what they mean.
[3:08:23.000 --> 3:08:39.000]  Now, what doofs everybody right away is the liberal cover. Well, he was part of the democratic society, believed in democracy, believed in liberals. That's not a thing. It's not a real thing.
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:50.000]  Have you not figured this out? That's a cloak. And the same people who run the world now use the same cloak. Somebody was just showing me a photo. It was so bizarre.
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:09:08.000]  I don't even know how to interpret it. The elites at Davos go through a ritual sort of hazing process where they pretend to be refugees and they crawl around on the ground and they have soldiers barking at them so that they get the experience of a refugee.
[3:09:08.000 --> 3:09:20.000]  I mean, it's probably just a photo op to make it look like they care about the refugees. They care about the people. Meanwhile, they say, let's kill everybody. How can we more effectively kill everybody?
[3:09:20.000 --> 3:09:38.000]  No, they care about the people. So Bertrand Russell begins his book with liberal order where liberal democratic denizens of science ism with science ism. But then he says in the very first chapter that if Darwinism is true, then there's no egalitarianism. Some people are more evolved than other people.
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:57.000]  I mean, what's the title of Charles Darwin's book, right? The origin of species, the favored races of man. Okay, so the whole, the very title of the book presupposes the idea that some people are not evolved and others are.
[3:09:57.000 --> 3:10:14.000]  He goes on the next chapter says, well, how are we going to erect a fair loving global government? Because he says that the scientific process and scientific technique are going to have the potentiality to erect a technocratic order that will become a nightmare dystopia.
[3:10:14.000 --> 3:10:28.000]  So he says, it's scary what they can do. They're going to do all these crazy things and he's going to list them. And who do you think he picks as the guy that the bad version of this Hitler, of course, right?
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:39.000]  Hitler. So Hitler's the bad guy, which he is, but he says, it's not the modus operandi of what Hitler had going. He just did it all wrong.
[3:10:39.000 --> 3:10:48.000]  He just should have put on a pink sweater. He should have put on rainbows, right? He should have done obeisance to liberal cover.
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:11:01.000]  And there would have been no problems with his views, right? Aside from the choosing the teutonic, Germanic idea, somehow like the ultimate, most evolved form of the race of the species, right?
[3:11:01.000 --> 3:11:14.000]  Well, the only difference is that Russell says, no, it's actually the Anglo-Saxon English citizen, the Lord and Ladies of London. They're the most evolved. It's literally the exact same philosophy, just a different group.
[3:11:14.000 --> 3:11:30.000]  But he says, what we're going to do is tweak this where we don't pick one race. Who cares about races? We're just going to pick amongst the different people groups, the most elite, the most wicked, the highest IQ, the most scientifically advanced amongst all the people groups.
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:44.000]  And we don't really care about the so-called races. And we'll make them kind of the future class that goes into the future and everybody else will have to come to us, the scientifically, and you'll have to prove why we should let you live.
[3:11:44.000 --> 3:12:03.000]  George Bernard Shaw says the exact same thing, part of the same Fabian social society. And so he says, what we're going to have to do is stoke fears. How can we scare everybody into accepting our plan for global government and a liberal technocracy, a liberal world order?
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:17.000]  And so the first thing we're going to do is come up with threats to the entire planet. Planetary global threats. What did Noah, Yuval, Harari, Novocaine, Yousafro, Ferrari, what did he just say the other day?
[3:12:17.000 --> 3:12:27.000]  It's a global threat. Climate. We're going to have to kill everyone. You don't have free will. He's saying literally what Bertrand Russell said one hundred years ago.
[3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:39.000]  There's no free will. But by the way, we have to stamp out free will. Well, how do you stamp something out doesn't exist. And by the way, in other interviews, just like Bertrand Russell, Harari contradicts himself as well.
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:52.000]  He says, in the future, there would be choices that are made at the top by the scientific elite, and then it will filter down and then you will be ruled by the AI. There will still be a human equation here at the very top.
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:13:01.000]  They will make choices for you, and then you will be governed by the AI. And then he says, there is no free will. No one will make choices. You don't have that. That's gone. That's old.
[3:13:01.000 --> 3:13:14.000]  This is gaslight. This is just lying in your face outright contradicting. I mean, in one video, he says there is free will among the elite who will make the decisions for you.
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:26.000]  And then there is no free will. No one has free will. That's an illusion. Okay, so again, basic fundamental contradiction at a very obvious prima facie level.
[3:13:26.000 --> 3:13:34.000]  Russell says that first thing we got to do, and this is where he's writing in the 50s, is he says, we got to figure out ways to destroy Russia.
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:52.000]  Yes, he says, because the Russian nation, he says, has the ability to, if they grew in population, and if they were able to maximize their resources, because it's such a resource dense country, and so vast,
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  they could potentially be a challenger or dominate the Anglo-UK degenerate empire, perfidious Albion. So he says, we have to stop them at all costs. And he says, that's why I really like the way Bolshevism and Stalinism have had such a disastrous effect on the Russian people.
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:27.000]  Now, he eventually doesn't like what Stalin does during the Cold War, and when Stalin rejects Marshall Plan A, this kicks off the Cold War. So I'm not trying to oversimplify this as if Bertrand Russell was always a proponent or a fan of Stalin and his actions.
[3:14:27.000 --> 3:14:41.000]  But originally, as we saw in last week's book, Scientific Outlook, at that time, writing in the 20s or 30s, he liked it. He's like, oh, I actually like the Bolsheviks. I like what they're doing because they're destroying and putting Russia under a scientific government.
[3:14:41.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  It's a scientific experiment. And he says, really, all this means is just get the population down. That's it. That's the only thing that we're concerned with, do whatever is possible to get Russia's population down.
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  And he says in this book, why? Because we don't want a competitor to the enlightened, evolved Anglo-Saxon man.
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:13.000]  Now, I'm not trying to make this a racial thing. Ultimately, it's not. It's a spiritual problem. It's a problem of evil.
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:28.000]  But that's the attitude that Bertrand Russell has as a rabid eugenicist at this time. And remember, although he in practice disagrees with Hitler's philosophy, he just has another version of a Hitlerian philosophy which says, kill everybody.
[3:15:28.000 --> 3:15:44.000]  And I'm going to show you in the book where he says this, the end of the book, in a kind of shocking way, actually, what he says. It's just the exact same thing that Duke of Kansas, right? He says it in a more pressing, more fundamental way.
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:56.000]  Now, I'll tell you about being reincarnated as a tiny British virus, but as a black death, as we'll see. This is the Out of the Dome Show. Don't go anywhere. I'm Jay Dyer, guest host.
[3:15:56.000 --> 3:16:04.000]  We here at Infowars are proud to announce the first-ever Kava Kava root supplement that is now available at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:16:04.000 --> 3:16:15.000]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[3:16:15.000 --> 3:16:31.000]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe. The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[3:16:31.000 --> 3:16:36.000]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:48.000]  Info Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to, German chamomile, organic skullcap, and ballerian root.
[3:16:48.000 --> 3:16:56.000]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfowarsStore.com.
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:17:13.000]  So it's a fact, and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true that Infowars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty, as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[3:17:13.000 --> 3:17:27.000]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done, so I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them, at InfowarsStore.com.

[3:18:11.000 --> 3:18:22.000]  Our immune systems have always been critical, but in this globalist era, with all the criminal activity they're involved in, it is more important than ever to take the tools God gave us and supercharge our immune systems.

[3:19:18.000 --> 3:19:26.000]  And they are announcing incredible tyranny. Everything we've talked about is now coming true, and the globalists want to take us off air.
[3:19:26.000 --> 3:19:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running the biggest sale in the history of Infowars right now. In our 28 years, all Infowars Apparel is being sold at cost until the inventory is gone and we're never going to print these t-shirts and ball caps at Infowars Flags again.
[3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:48.000]  We may have t-shirts in apparel in the future, but I don't even know. We are blowing out of everything to get emergency funds in right now.
[3:19:48.000 --> 3:19:55.000]  I'm firing the bat signal and asking you to get your t-shirts at InfowarsStore.com right now. They're at cost.
[3:19:55.000 --> 3:20:02.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:11.000 --> 3:20:23.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones. I'm your guest host, Jay at Dyer of Jay's Analysis. We're talking about Burson Russell's explanation of how the technocratic government will be put in in a sneaky little stealthy way
[3:20:23.000 --> 3:20:28.000]  so that you won't fall for it and you will think it's liberal.
[3:20:28.000 --> 3:20:40.000]  So he's really one of the pioneers of this idea that you hear Alex always joking about, right, of putting on a pink sweater and knitting around and that will actually convince people that, oh, it's not threatening.
[3:20:40.000 --> 3:20:44.000]  It's not scary because it's not Stormtroopers coming at me with Jack Boots.
[3:20:44.000 --> 3:20:53.000]  It's tech guys bouncing around and giggling in pink sweaters and hoodies, right, and trendy socks.
[3:20:53.000 --> 3:21:07.000]  Alex's always making this joke. Well, that's accurate. Burson Russell's one of the first guys to really come up with this idea that seems to me to say, well, all you have to do is dress your death order up in a bunch of liberal garb and people buy into it.
[3:21:07.000 --> 3:21:25.000]  Now the whole world is basically duped by a liberal face, liberal front to a death cult. So it's like there's an inner death cult core and then there's like a pink outer portico of soft, sensitive softies, right.
[3:21:25.000 --> 3:21:33.000]  So you can be in the profane pink outer core or you can be in the inner death core of just pure Satanism.
[3:21:33.000 --> 3:21:40.000]  Now the global government, he says, that could be erected. Now get this, this is his little tricky bait and switch he does.
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:50.000]  He says, there could be a terrible world government that is erected. That's a scientific dictatorship. That's his, the way he describes it.
[3:21:50.000 --> 3:22:07.000]  And he says, what they'll probably do is attack the food supply through genetic modification, through tainting everything with toxins, making everything basically poisonous, deadly.
[3:22:07.000 --> 3:22:20.000]  He says they will use inoculations, vaccines, diet. But he's saying this before Jonah Salk in his books said, let's use vaccines to experiment on people on a wide scale.
[3:22:20.000 --> 3:22:31.000]  He says that and will do this, he says, he's saying, I don't, I don't advocate this, but they might do this. But by the way, later on, it will advocate this.
[3:22:31.000 --> 3:22:40.000]  This is what he does, right. So keep in mind that he's playing right now like he doesn't believe in this. But he says this scientific dictatorship will do all this in a backdoor stealthy way.
[3:22:40.000 --> 3:22:48.000]  But what they'll do is convince everybody that it's good, liberal and healthy by using pop culture.
[3:22:48.000 --> 3:23:02.000]  So Bertrand Russell was one of the early pioneers of pop culture. Again, makes sense because he's in the same circles with HD Wells and the Fabian Social Society, who pioneered using popular culture to promote his
[3:23:02.000 --> 3:23:17.000]  scientism, global order depopulation agenda. All of the all of the HD Wells science fiction is just a fiction version that will reach the masses of his more boring technical stuff about world government that nobody reads.
[3:23:17.000 --> 3:23:25.000]  But everybody's going to read War of the Worlds. Everybody's going to read Alan and Dr. Moreau, Time Machine, all these books that promote his version of scientism.
[3:23:25.000 --> 3:23:34.000]  He says, do not use logic on the masses. They will not be convinced by your reasoning and your logic and your objective argumentation and facts.
[3:23:34.000 --> 3:23:48.000]  He says, use music, pomp, smoke and mirrors. He says, that will get everybody convinced. Look at all the pop stars. This is the whole pop culture is getting you to accept the culture of death.
[3:23:48.000 --> 3:24:02.000]  And even says that they will become so sophisticated at this technique of using the pop culture to brainwash that you will be able to convince people in this technocracy that snow is black.
[3:24:02.000 --> 3:24:13.000]  They'll be so brainwashed that if I tell you to say that the snow is black, you won't just say it is because you think I want you to say that. You will actually believe it.
[3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:24.000]  And that is what Orwell is writing about in 1984 is what's in these texts of Russell. Orwell was describing what the people that he was around wanted to do.
[3:24:24.000 --> 3:24:30.000]  Who do you think he's talking about? He's talking about this. Okay.
[3:24:30.000 --> 3:24:39.000]  Now, Russell goes on to say, well, look, globalism is inevitable. And what I just told you sounds like a nightmare, right?
[3:24:39.000 --> 3:24:45.000]  He says that the nation state is an old defunct idea, and that's dead and gone because now we live in the world of power blocks.
[3:24:45.000 --> 3:24:50.000]  And the world wars enabled us to transition into power blocks.
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:55.000]  And so now we have a basis to get rid of international law.
[3:24:55.000 --> 3:25:13.000]  He says that the nuke crisis and the nuclear war, nuclear proliferation and all this stuff, really, that's just the means by which there would be an international policing governing unit coming out of the United Nations, coming out of the Baruch plan.
[3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:21.000]  And that was kind of what helped us move away from the notion of international law into a power block world where there is no such thing as international law anymore.
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:25.000]  And then he goes on to say that there will be a fake left.
[3:25:25.000 --> 3:25:32.000]  So the very chapter after that, Chapter 3, he describes the technocracy. He calls it a scientific oligarchy.
[3:25:32.000 --> 3:25:40.000]  He says they'll have a left cover. I wonder how he knew that. Well, maybe because he is the left cover for this.
[3:25:40.000 --> 3:25:47.000]  And I'm going to show you how that's the case. Now, he goes on and says that when this really comes into fruition, when they really set up this 1984 scenario,
[3:25:47.000 --> 3:25:51.000]  he says it's going to be the worst thing you can imagine.
[3:25:51.000 --> 3:25:57.000]  He says it's going to be spying and surveillance of everyone at all times. There will be child spies.
[3:25:57.000 --> 3:26:06.000]  Child spies, your children will be incentivized to rat on you, parents, authorities, etc.
[3:26:06.000 --> 3:26:13.000]  And so it will be intentionally inverted. He says there will be such things as geoengineering, cloud seeding.
[3:26:13.000 --> 3:26:22.000]  They will use, as we said, vaccines, diet. They might even promote the most heinous things like cannibalism for the masses.
[3:26:22.000 --> 3:26:35.000]  He says because anything that works to sterilize, stunt, deform, and basically stultify and make you unable to have offspring to go into the future, he says that's the goal.
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:44.000]  And then he says the model for this is Plato's Republic. He says it on page 51 right there, Plato's Republic. See that right there?
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:51.000]  There he says it, Plato's Republic. So if Plato's Republic is the model, maybe we should be aware of what Plato talked about.
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:27:01.000]  Maybe we should be aware of the fact that Plato said that we need to practice and fantasize. We need to kill large portions of the population so that they don't get out of balance with Mother Earth.
[3:27:01.000 --> 3:27:12.000]  That's Plato's view. He says that in this global government, in the technocracy, that's his word, there will not be rights, there will not be anything like that.
[3:27:12.000 --> 3:27:23.000]  He says that it will all be top-down control by a scientific elite. And he says it will all be under the cover of democracy.
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:31.000]  Now he says, and he uses these kind of platitudes, oh, it's not really fair and it's not really what we would like to do and maybe this isn't the best idea.
[3:27:31.000 --> 3:27:38.000]  And he says, I don't like all of that sound. That stuff sounds bad. So he says, here's the better way to do it.
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:44.000]  So now he's just going to take all that horrible stuff. He's going to say, let's just do it in a nice way. I'm not kidding.
[3:27:44.000 --> 3:27:51.000]  That's what he says in the book. He says there's better, nicer ways to do it, easier ways to do it.
[3:27:51.000 --> 3:27:58.000]  And so he says that we're going to have to lie to everybody. There's going to have to be a large-scale deception to get this across.
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:28:04.000]  But he says, really, keep in mind that the public never knows what's going on anyway. They're always duped anyway. The public is stupid.
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:11.000]  So just keep lying to them and telling them that this is the best for them and keep selling it as freedom.
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:21.000]  And he says, look at the models of the I-Lenin. He says, Lenin was a model of this. Democratic socialism, he says.
[3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:31.000]  Sell the people on collectivism and democratic socialism for their own good. It's all a lie. But who cares? That's what's...
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:35.000]  I mean, they deserve it because they're stupid anyway and they need to die.
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:41.000]  He's telling you, people that believe this, that you're dumb if you believe this.
[3:28:41.000 --> 3:28:50.000]  And then he's the same guy that brings the Frankfurt School Marxist over to the West to help destroy western civilization by his own design, to bring in the technocracy.
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:29:06.000]  Don't go anywhere. We'll be right back as we look at Bertrand Russell's evil texts.
[3:29:20.000 --> 3:29:29.000]  10 million views a day were a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[3:29:29.000 --> 3:29:33.000]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[3:29:33.000 --> 3:29:40.000]  Info wars and Bandai video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide.
[3:29:40.000 --> 3:29:47.000]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[3:29:47.000 --> 3:29:56.000]  The biggest sale in info wars history is going right now, the mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off, getting incredible products and keep info wars as strong as ever.

[3:30:56.000 --> 3:31:13.000]  April 2022 just kicked off and it's already been incredible. Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, Joe Biden, they along with many other new order operatives have gone on national television and announced that we are now under a world government.
[3:31:13.000 --> 3:31:24.000]  They have a summit taking place right now in Dubai titled World Government Summit and they are announcing incredible tyranny. Everything we've talked about is now coming true.
[3:31:24.000 --> 3:31:32.000]  And the globalists want to take us off air. Ladies and gentlemen, we are running the biggest sale in the history of info wars right now.
[3:31:32.000 --> 3:31:43.000]  In our 28 years, all info wars apparel is being sold at cost until the inventory is gone and we're never going to print these t-shirts and ball caps and info wars flags again.
[3:31:43.000 --> 3:31:56.000]  We may have t-shirts in apparel in the future, but I don't even know. We are blowing out of everything to get emergency funds in right now. I'm firing the bat signal and asking you to get your t-shirts at infowarstore.com right now. They're at cost.
[3:32:13.000 --> 3:32:23.000]  I'm very, very proud of it and it will end up being a collectible. I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what we sold it.
[3:32:23.000 --> 3:32:32.000]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly and I appreciate listeners getting over half of them now. I'd like to move them out very quickly.
[3:32:32.000 --> 3:32:40.000]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days and without the last coin sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[3:32:40.000 --> 3:32:49.000]  We would have had to lay off a lot of people and that's a big problem. So it was a limited edition collectible, tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems.
[3:32:49.000 --> 3:33:10.000]  So please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the new order at 1776coin.com.
[3:33:10.000 --> 3:33:21.000]  Welcome back. I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis. We were talking about the technocratic world government that Bertrand Russell predicted to come in and the liberal cover that he puts on it.
[3:33:21.000 --> 3:33:30.000]  And then later on in the book, he's going to tell us what he really wants. What does he really want? Well, as we're moving through, we saw the Republic of Plato as the model.
[3:33:30.000 --> 3:33:48.000]  He says that the New World Order really is about death. He says that the world order that's coming will utilize the power and principle of death to steer the species to its proper end goal in his mind in the sense of steering and commandeering evolution.
[3:33:48.000 --> 3:34:07.000]  Since death is part of the natural process, he argues, then death should just be accepted and the scientific elite need to utilize death. He says that really what this leads to is the need and necessity for an international global authority that trumps every local nation state and law.
[3:34:07.000 --> 3:34:16.000]  Now, wait a minute. I thought he had said a few minutes ago that he doesn't want to see a tyrannical world government. Oh, this is the nice world government. See, this is the nice one.
[3:34:16.000 --> 3:34:31.000]  Oh, okay. So yeah, this is the liberal one, not the tyrannical one. And the nice one is going to give you the vaccines, give you the GMO foods, give you the sterilization, give you the toxic culture in a friendly coom podway.
[3:34:31.000 --> 3:34:38.000]  So you're going to enjoy it. You see, it won't be a hard. They're not going to put you in a camp and murder you. They're going to murder you in a slow kill way.
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:57.000]  And that was the whole ethos of the Fabian socialist slow kill model. You see, so he was part of that group again with H.G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw, the Fabian socialist who had as their model both a wolf in sheep's clothing as their symbol and a turtle because it's a slow version of this.
[3:34:57.000 --> 3:35:15.000]  It doesn't work very good to stomp down the streets, you know, in stormtrooper outfits that scares people. Just dress it all up in propaganda and liberalism and health and consumerism, basically.
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  Death, he says, is actually the real deity. I'm not joking. He says that if you really want to understand who God is or what God is, what people call God is really just a symbol of their fear of death.
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:44.000]  And he says on page 78 that really death is the real God. And if he says, if you want to understand our worldview, we have accepted death, not just as a reality, but as the real motivating power in the universe in evolution to propel the species.
[3:35:44.000 --> 3:36:05.000]  So it's a death cult. We worship a death cult. Do you remember Planet of the Apes? It's a really silly series, cheeseball, but in I think the second installment, there's a cult in the apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic monkey world that worships the bomb, the bomb almighty.
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:17.000]  They have a religious service where they worship this bomb. And although that's a goofy B movie, that actually is a great image of the attitude of Bertrand Russell.
[3:36:17.000 --> 3:36:29.000]  They have like a liturgical service and like a choir. There's like a cult of really pale, mutated people who worship the bomb almighty as the symbol of mass death.
[3:36:29.000 --> 3:36:42.000]  Yeah, there you go. That's it. It's a whole church service they have. So you want to go to church with Bertrand Russell? There you go. That's his church. So don't go there.
[3:36:42.000 --> 3:36:52.000]  I'm not joining that church. He says that the reason we believe this is just scientific pragmatism. We don't care about truth. We don't care about it. It's all about will to power and force.
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:37:04.000]  And that doesn't sound very liberal. I thought you were a liberal fan of freedom of democracy. Now you're telling me that might makes right, that social Darwinism leads to a Nietzschean will to power.
[3:37:04.000 --> 3:37:14.000]  That sounds like Hitler again. I thought you were against Hitler. No, I'm not against Hitler in terms of his philosophy, Russell's saying. I'm against the approach he took.
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:29.000]  He did it in all the wrong way. He should have just done a music video. If he had done an MTV video and dressed it all up in skittles and candy, then it would have been fine.
[3:37:29.000 --> 3:37:39.000]  And he would have gotten a lot more done. And in a sense, I guess you could say Russell is right about appealing to the weaknesses in human nature that from a pragmatic standpoint,
[3:37:39.000 --> 3:37:55.000]  if the people seeking global government had utilized the latest research in terms of Bernays, Walter Lippmann, admin type stuff, madman type stuff, they could have been able to sell it a lot better.
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:38:08.000]  And guess what? Oh, that's now you see, that's where we live. We live now in the world where all of those techniques of advertising, psychological warfare, lying, gaslighting, selling it as a right.
[3:38:08.000 --> 3:38:23.000]  This was crucial. This is what Russell decades before Tim Leary or Tim Leary said that I couldn't get people to do acid on a mass scale until I told them that it was their right.
[3:38:23.000 --> 3:38:35.000]  And that they were being denied their rights to do LSD on a mass scale. He said, once I promoted it and sold it as your right that's being taken from you and trampled,
[3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:44.000]  he said, I learned a powerful message in terms of human social engineering. And guess who was way before him in terms of that? Decades ahead, Bertrand Russell.
[3:38:44.000 --> 3:38:57.000]  By the way, did you know Bertrand Russell actually had free love views way before anybody else? The 60s counterculture ethos of free love, all of that.
[3:38:57.000 --> 3:39:10.000]  Russell had that view decades earlier in the 20s and 30s. He believed that back then he's actually open about it and a lot of his exes and mistresses and various people, you know, fussed about it and made a big deal about it.
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:21.000]  And Russell saw the effects of that and he said, why don't we just apply these techniques in mass, you see. That's the weaponization of human biology and sexuality.
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:33.000]  And so you hear Alex all the time, he talks about siege, right. These are the people that know how to conduct siege, not just in classical warfare, but in terms of mental warfare,
[3:39:33.000 --> 3:39:41.000]  Info War, Cycle Warfare, you say, Cy War. And they had learned this and figured this out a long time ago.
[3:39:41.000 --> 3:39:49.000]  So when it comes to big things like Coofit and getting everybody to take stabs, what do we see the Canadian government admit?
[3:39:49.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  Oh, yes, we use psychological warfare techniques that NATO developed to deceive the public to scare the crap out of them to get them to do this.
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:40:00.000]  That it was all admitted. What do we see come out what, yesterday?
[3:40:00.000 --> 3:40:11.000]  Oh, yeah, a lot of the news stories about the Ukraine are lies and they're fake intelligence, but it's for the good of everybody else. We have to do that, you say.
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:23.000]  So Russell goes on to say, it's true that socialism has succeeded in its fanatical creed in terms of killing millions of people.
[3:40:23.000 --> 3:40:31.000]  But he says, but why is that really bad? So he's like, yeah, socialism does work to kill lots of people.
[3:40:31.000 --> 3:40:37.000]  But so what? Like, why is that a problem? He says, really, the problem is that it doesn't kill enough.
[3:40:37.000 --> 3:40:47.000]  And then he talks about the cult of the bomb. He actually has a chapter on the cult of the bomb, literally what's in Planet of the Apes 2.
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:54.000]  I'm making that up. If you have read this book, you will know if you've seen that. Maybe you think, well, this is just like Planet of the Apes 2. What's going on here? This is crazy.
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:41:08.000]  And Russell goes on to say, well, the reason I like the bomb is that it is the potential salvation in terms of depopulation.
[3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:16.000]  He says that, right? He says it might not be the best way to do it because we can't necessarily ensure that the elite will survive, too, right?
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:20.000]  If we bomb it, blow the planet up, right? That's not going to be the best for us.
[3:41:20.000 --> 3:41:28.000]  So what can we do in terms of warfare or strategies to get the population down?
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:37.000]  Because then he gets to the key chapter, chapters six and seven, where he says, we're going to have to have a world state.
[3:41:37.000 --> 3:41:42.000]  We need an international authority. We got to sell it and dress it up in rainbow liberal garb.
[3:41:42.000 --> 3:41:49.000]  But how are we going to do that to be effective in terms of radically reducing population?
[3:41:49.000 --> 3:41:53.000]  This is where it gets really important and juicy in his book.
[3:41:53.000 --> 3:41:59.000]  Because one thing that we got to do is right now begin the reeducation process.
[3:41:59.000 --> 3:42:09.000]  That's what he says. Reeducation process to process and socialize people into accepting this system through education.
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:14.000]  He says that, I don't see this as a future that will be either capitalist or communist.
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:25.000]  He says, back then, I envisioned some kind of third way system that utilizes elements of both to have this global control structure.
[3:42:25.000 --> 3:42:29.000]  But the number one problem, he says, is population.
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:36.000]  So we're going to engage in a series of techniques to convince everybody that the world must be radically depopulated.
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:41.000]  He says it's going to take a long time, right? It's going to take decades to get people into this attitude.
[3:42:41.000 --> 3:42:45.000]  We're living now in the time that he was talking about 100 years ago. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
[3:42:45.000 --> 3:42:50.000]  We get back, we're going to look at his techniques, how everybody will be killed.
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:55.000]  Virgin Russell told us 100 years ago, how we're going to kill everybody, he says. Let's find out when we come back.
[3:42:55.000 --> 3:42:59.000]  We are only offering three coins in the series.
[3:42:59.000 --> 3:43:04.000]  The first coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days.
[3:43:04.000 --> 3:43:12.000]  Now the second coin as we enter the last days of March into April 2022 is now being offered.
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:23.000]  I believe it will sell out in just a few days again because these are historic coins and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep in full wars at the front lines of the fight against these tyrants.
[3:43:23.000 --> 3:43:30.000]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty Tree coin.
[3:43:30.000 --> 3:43:46.000]  It is powerful. Witness this powerful iconography for yourself and have this piece of history and be part of the founding member system that we're set to launch in the very near future thanks to your support of this project.
[3:43:46.000 --> 3:43:55.000]  Get a historic memento that helps keep info wars on the air and also gives you a real piece of history at 1776coin.com.
[3:43:55.000 --> 3:44:00.000]  With the world awakening, I think what's important that we were at the momentum right now, take advantage of this moment.
[3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:08.000]  And I've always had an idea that something everybody can do with every listener can do. I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to hang the banners over highways.
[3:44:08.000 --> 3:44:13.000]  Imagine a giant thing in our Houston, Atlanta, Atlanta that says Alex Jones is right, info wars dot karma.
[3:44:13.000 --> 3:44:16.000]  We stand with the truckers, we'll rest out or whatever.
[3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:18.000]  Brother, I'm so glad you called elaborate on this.
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:27.000]  Yes, now is the time in your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on your car or banner hangs over highways.
[3:44:27.000 --> 3:44:29.000]  And it will be a chain reaction.
[3:44:29.000 --> 3:44:31.000]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[3:44:31.000 --> 3:44:32.000]  I have a few ideas.
[3:44:32.000 --> 3:44:35.000]  First of all, health care is one important form.
[3:44:35.000 --> 3:44:37.000]  Rest out, rest out, swap.
[3:44:37.000 --> 3:44:38.000]  The vaccine is poison.
[3:44:38.000 --> 3:44:39.000]  There's tons of things.
[3:44:39.000 --> 3:44:40.000]  I said, keep it short.
[3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:41.000]  Keep it concise.
[3:44:41.000 --> 3:44:42.000]  No, I agree.
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:43.000]  Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates.
[3:44:43.000 --> 3:44:45.000]  The COVID backs is poison.
[3:44:45.000 --> 3:44:46.000]  Beautiful.
[3:44:46.000 --> 3:44:49.000]  There's ways that we can all be involved if we can all be affected.
[3:44:49.000 --> 3:44:50.000]  So that's what I'm calling about.
[3:44:50.000 --> 3:44:51.000]  God bless you, Chris.
[3:44:51.000 --> 3:44:54.000]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[3:44:54.000 --> 3:44:55.000]  Thank you so much.
[3:44:55.000 --> 3:45:04.000]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three part founder series at 1776 coin dot com or info or store dot com.
[3:45:04.000 --> 3:45:07.000]  And the second installment is the tree of liberty.
[3:45:07.000 --> 3:45:11.000]  Thomas Jefferson quote must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:12.000]  It's a coin I designed.
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:15.000]  I'm very, very proud of it and it will end up being a collectible.
[3:45:15.000 --> 3:45:22.000]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what we sold it.
[3:45:22.000 --> 3:45:25.000]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly.
[3:45:25.000 --> 3:45:29.000]  And I appreciate listeners getting over half of them now.
[3:45:29.000 --> 3:45:31.000]  I'd like to move them out very quickly.
[3:45:31.000 --> 3:45:34.000]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days.
[3:45:34.000 --> 3:45:39.000]  And without the last coin sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[3:45:39.000 --> 3:45:41.000]  We would have had to lay off a lot of people and had some big problems.
[3:45:41.000 --> 3:45:45.000]  So it was a limited edition collectible tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom.
[3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:48.000]  And it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems.
[3:45:48.000 --> 3:45:55.000]  So please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the new order at 1776 coin dot com.
[3:45:55.000 --> 3:46:00.000]  The newest product from the fore's life is now available exclusively at info or store dot com.

[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:21.000]  it is more important than ever to take the tools God gave us and supercharge our immune systems.
[3:46:21.000 --> 3:46:25.000]  Info wars life immune support is a game changer.

[3:47:06.000 --> 3:47:20.000]  Welcome back to the House of Jones. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[3:47:20.000 --> 3:47:26.000]  I use it every day. I probably brush my teeth probably like five times at least from 9 to 10 a.m.
[3:47:26.000 --> 3:47:31.000]  And then probably irregular intervals about five times each hour.
[3:47:31.000 --> 3:47:36.000]  I also brush my teeth again. So I love my cruel calcium. I'm joking, but I actually do like it.
[3:47:36.000 --> 3:47:40.000]  I do have two bottles of it because I know the first one is going to run out at least by the end of the day.
[3:47:40.000 --> 3:47:45.000]  So go get those products. Get the super malvotality. Get the brain force.
[3:47:45.000 --> 3:47:49.000]  Get all those products that do support the info war definitely.
[3:47:49.000 --> 3:47:52.000]  There's also t-shirts. There's also documentaries, books, all that stuff.
[3:47:52.000 --> 3:48:00.000]  I've actually bought quite a bit from Alex over the years and most of those books, documentaries and whatnot have been pretty much game changers for me.
[3:48:00.000 --> 3:48:03.000]  And I highly recommend that you go get them too.
[3:48:03.000 --> 3:48:09.000]  You can also get my book at my website, Jay's Analysis.com. There's a shop and you get signed copies of my books.
[3:48:09.000 --> 3:48:13.000]  Every copy is a signed copy. Don't get it from Jeff Bezos.
[3:48:13.000 --> 3:48:19.000]  He might be trying to forge my signature, but you'll be able to tell it's not me.
[3:48:19.000 --> 3:48:21.000]  And that's Jeff's signature, not mine.
[3:48:21.000 --> 3:48:25.000]  So get the real authentic signature over at my website, not from Amazon.
[3:48:25.000 --> 3:48:33.000]  And we're talking about Bertrand Russell, his view of the sneaky, sneaky, sneaky stealth way to get in this scientific dictatorship.
[3:48:33.000 --> 3:48:35.000]  How can we sneak this in the back door?
[3:48:35.000 --> 3:48:41.000]  Well, he says we're going to have to think about subtle things like food. Food.
[3:48:41.000 --> 3:48:42.000]  Yes.
[3:48:42.000 --> 3:48:49.000]  Now, we had mentioned earlier GMOs, but he says feeding the planet is something that we can immediately go to.
[3:48:49.000 --> 3:49:03.000]  And perhaps if we cause a resource war or an intentional shortage, we can give the impression that there's too many people and there's not enough food to go around.
[3:49:03.000 --> 3:49:15.000]  If we can hype this up and scare people more and more and more through zillions of dollars of propaganda, through other staged fake resource crises like peak oil.
[3:49:15.000 --> 3:49:19.000]  He was talking about peak oil as well as HG wells back in the 30s, 40s, 50s.
[3:49:19.000 --> 3:49:25.000]  They said we can convince people that they're using up too much of the dinosaur juice.
[3:49:25.000 --> 3:49:30.000]  And there's not enough dinosaur juice to go around, aka oil, so cold fossil fuels.
[3:49:30.000 --> 3:49:38.000]  And he says all we have to do is inculcate guilt, make people feel guilty for eating and breathing.
[3:49:38.000 --> 3:49:39.000]  That's what he says.
[3:49:39.000 --> 3:49:40.000]  This is the whole chapter.
[3:49:40.000 --> 3:49:51.000]  Guilt convinced the masses that they're guilty of breathing air and using oil and eating food because there's not enough.
[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:52.000]  How dare you?
[3:49:52.000 --> 3:50:01.000]  He says that really this is Malthusianism applied to global logistics and global supply chains.
[3:50:01.000 --> 3:50:11.000]  He says if you can do this successfully enough to where you can keep causing these shocks to the system, and what did we just hear about shutting things down?
[3:50:11.000 --> 3:50:17.000]  Pipelines, food supply lines, food shortages, Biden just talked about it.
[3:50:17.000 --> 3:50:19.000]  Yeah, there's going to be shortages, man.
[3:50:19.000 --> 3:50:20.000]  Come on, man.
[3:50:20.000 --> 3:50:22.000]  There's going to be food shortages.
[3:50:22.000 --> 3:50:23.000]  Come on, man.
[3:50:23.000 --> 3:50:25.000]  Well, that's a strategy, right?
[3:50:25.000 --> 3:50:27.000]  It's not a real problem.
[3:50:27.000 --> 3:50:40.000]  It's a Fortune 100 corporate engineer plan to intentionally cause and make there be shortages, sort of a holodom or type of thing, starve them out,
[3:50:40.000 --> 3:50:49.000]  give it the impression that it was caused by evil right wingers and people who have farms and people that eat meat.
[3:50:49.000 --> 3:50:53.000]  They're eating too many resources up and there's not enough to go around.
[3:50:53.000 --> 3:50:55.000]  It's an intentional shortage.
[3:50:55.000 --> 3:50:56.000]  It's fake.
[3:50:56.000 --> 3:50:58.000]  It's a made up crisis.
[3:50:58.000 --> 3:51:00.000]  It's an engineered crisis.
[3:51:00.000 --> 3:51:02.000]  It's a fundamental element of warfare.
[3:51:02.000 --> 3:51:04.000]  It's called siege.
[3:51:04.000 --> 3:51:07.000]  You hear Alex talk about it.
[3:51:07.000 --> 3:51:13.000]  And all this is a siege with a bunch of lies on top of it that people are using up to many resources.
[3:51:13.000 --> 3:51:14.000]  It's not true.
[3:51:14.000 --> 3:51:17.000]  It's a lie.
[3:51:17.000 --> 3:51:24.000]  And Bertrand Russell says we will use these techniques on purpose to blame people.
[3:51:24.000 --> 3:51:29.000]  People believe that it's everybody else that people will turn on each other.
[3:51:29.000 --> 3:51:31.000]  It's a really simple thing.
[3:51:31.000 --> 3:51:35.000]  So all this system does is caused what you see on the screen there.
[3:51:35.000 --> 3:51:46.000]  They cause that on purpose through two years of pandemic and then supply chain shortages that are done on purpose by corporate vipers.
[3:51:46.000 --> 3:51:55.000]  And then they say you are having shortages because people wouldn't get vaccines, you are having shortages because people are eating too much meat and using too many resources.
[3:51:55.000 --> 3:51:57.000]  It's all lies.
[3:51:57.000 --> 3:52:09.000]  And all that does is split the population down the middle to get the zombie horde mad at the other half of the population that is halfway awake to get them to turn on each other, rip them each other apart.
[3:52:09.000 --> 3:52:13.000]  And then it moves into the next phase of the lockdown and the collapse.
[3:52:13.000 --> 3:52:16.000]  It's a basic warfare strategy.
[3:52:16.000 --> 3:52:20.000]  It's not even hard to figure out.
[3:52:20.000 --> 3:52:27.000]  And so Russell goes on to say that what can we do to get this through?
[3:52:27.000 --> 3:52:32.000]  Now I've already told you that I don't like the jack boot top down model.
[3:52:32.000 --> 3:52:35.000]  We need a nicer model or a stealth model.
[3:52:35.000 --> 3:52:42.000]  He says quote, this is page 102.
[3:52:42.000 --> 3:52:51.000]  The inevitable result of the increase of the population is if it is not checked, then we're going to have to resort to Malthusian laws.
[3:52:51.000 --> 3:52:54.000]  I do not pretend that this is what page 121 moves on to say.
[3:52:54.000 --> 3:52:59.000]  I don't pretend that birth control is the only way to get this done to keep it from increasing.
[3:52:59.000 --> 3:53:05.000]  There are other methods which one must suppose opponents of birth control would prefer war.
[3:53:05.000 --> 3:53:12.000]  Remember he had talked about the bomb almighty and war.
[3:53:12.000 --> 3:53:14.000]  War has hitherto been disappointing for bringing down population.
[3:53:14.000 --> 3:53:20.000]  But perhaps bacteriological warfare could prove more effective.
[3:53:20.000 --> 3:53:31.000]  If a black death could be spread throughout the world once in every generation, survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full.
[3:53:31.000 --> 3:53:41.000]  If a black death could be spread throughout the world in every generation, survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full.
[3:53:41.000 --> 3:53:43.000]  Did you hear me? Do you hear that?
[3:53:43.000 --> 3:53:46.000]  Page 102, excuse me 103.
[3:53:46.000 --> 3:54:00.000]  If a black death could be spread throughout the world in every generation, survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full.
[3:54:00.000 --> 3:54:02.000]  It's a death cult.
[3:54:02.000 --> 3:54:04.000]  He's telling you that right there.
[3:54:04.000 --> 3:54:06.000]  That's not out of context.
[3:54:06.000 --> 3:54:09.000]  He goes on to say that a lot of people can handle that.
[3:54:09.000 --> 3:54:12.000]  But if you're high-minded, you can handle that.
[3:54:12.000 --> 3:54:14.000]  He says high-minded people could handle this.
[3:54:14.000 --> 3:54:18.000]  Then he goes on to say that why does anybody have a problem with this?
[3:54:18.000 --> 3:54:22.000]  Infanticide was essential to Plato's Republic.
[3:54:22.000 --> 3:54:26.000]  And the Soviet Union was based on Plato's Republic and they had Infanticide.
[3:54:26.000 --> 3:54:29.000]  Why does anybody have a problem with abortion and infanticide?
[3:54:29.000 --> 3:54:39.000]  He says that if you believe in evolution, you must believe in world government because clearly we're evolving to a world government.
[3:54:39.000 --> 3:54:41.000]  What? Really?
[3:54:41.000 --> 3:54:43.000]  I don't know. I thought there's no purpose.
[3:54:43.000 --> 3:54:49.000]  There's no telos, but somehow there is a purpose in evolution to guide us to world government, which it doesn't make any sense.
[3:54:49.000 --> 3:55:01.000]  This whole chapter is about that. It's about the end goal and then there's a final kind of conclusion section about de-population.
[3:55:01.000 --> 3:55:08.000]  He says that industrialization has this effect, which is good, which he says to bring down population.
[3:55:08.000 --> 3:55:16.000]  He says non-industrialized populations, families, for example, they depend upon having a lot of kids to run their farm or whatever.
[3:55:16.000 --> 3:55:24.000]  So it was kind of necessary because one of the positive effects of a scientific technocratic society is that when you get automation, you don't need people.
[3:55:24.000 --> 3:55:25.000]  You don't need kids.
[3:55:25.000 --> 3:55:41.000]  So the more technocracy we have, the more we have an industrialized population that will be necessarily the case that not only will we not need people, we will have to have less and less people.
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:49.000]  So he ends the whole thing by saying that the key to a technocratic future is to massively de-populate the world.
[3:55:49.000 --> 3:55:58.000]  By any of the stealth means, the backdoor means, the slow kill, Fabian socialist, slow model approach.
[3:55:58.000 --> 3:56:09.000]  So that's why the world has been under this gradualism ever since, for example, the fall of the Soviet Union, which remember Bertrand Russell said, the Soviet Union was a fantastic experiment.
[3:56:09.000 --> 3:56:15.000]  David Rockefeller, Mao's government is a fantastic experiment.
[3:56:15.000 --> 3:56:27.000]  So from their vantage point, the technocrats, the scientific elite, so-called, these revolutions are mass experiments.
[3:56:27.000 --> 3:56:30.000]  What happens if we do a scientific government in Russia?
[3:56:30.000 --> 3:56:38.000]  What happens if we force a Maoist revolution in China, which was funded and forced upon the Chinese by the OSS?
[3:56:38.000 --> 3:56:41.000]  Did you know that the OSS trained Mao's guerrillas?
[3:56:41.000 --> 3:56:45.000]  Did you know that Mao was a Yali, Yale in China?
[3:56:45.000 --> 3:56:51.000]  Mao was helped into position by skull and bones on record, public.
[3:56:51.000 --> 3:56:55.000]  Yale magazine, they have public things bragging about this.
[3:56:55.000 --> 3:56:57.000]  We helped put Mao in power.
[3:56:57.000 --> 3:57:04.000]  We helped change China forever through the cultural revolution that the OSS supported.
[3:57:04.000 --> 3:57:09.000]  Now you understand why David Rockefeller says, Maoism is great.
[3:57:09.000 --> 3:57:11.000]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[3:57:11.000 --> 3:57:17.000]  One of the most wealthy capitalists in the world is a massive proponent of communism.
[3:57:17.000 --> 3:57:26.000]  Bertrand Russell, the face of liberal democracy, loves socialism, fabianism, communism, Stalinism, Maoism.
[3:57:26.000 --> 3:57:28.000]  Why wouldn't he love those things?
[3:57:28.000 --> 3:57:31.000]  Because they get the job done in terms of killing everybody.
[3:57:31.000 --> 3:57:35.000]  And he says it's a death cult and we're going to kill everybody.
[3:57:35.000 --> 3:57:37.000]  And these are the means that we're going to use.
[3:57:37.000 --> 3:57:42.000]  And if you can't hear that, if you can't wake up to that, you will be susceptible to it.
[3:57:42.000 --> 3:58:02.000]  That's what Bertrand Russell tells you.
[3:58:12.000 --> 3:58:14.000]  In full wars, it's paradoxical.
[3:58:14.000 --> 3:58:16.000]  It's more popular than ever.
[3:58:16.000 --> 3:58:18.000]  It's reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
