[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  It's Monday, September 12th, the year is coming to an end, and we are there in direct conflict
[00:11.000 --> 00:16.000]  with the Marine Corps.
[00:16.000 --> 00:20.000]  Info wars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:20.000 --> 00:26.000]  The globalists are in grave danger.
[00:26.000 --> 00:29.000]  Their new world order is not going well.
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.000]  Humanity is waking up to them all over the planet.
[00:33.000 --> 00:43.000]  There are populist parties, nationalist parties, anti-world economic forum parties coming to power.
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  The new Conservative leader in Canada is completely anti-new world order and just won the leadership of his party.
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.000]  If they held elections today, Justin Trudeau would be removed as the leader of Canada.
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  And the same thing is happening around the world.
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.000]  So as bad as things are, it's because the globalists are desperate and know that they are behind the aid bowl.
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.000]  Thank you so much for joining us. This is going to be an extremely powerful broadcast today.
[01:08.000 --> 01:15.000]  The big interview that I taped last Thursday morning with Andrew Tate, the most Google man in the world,
[01:15.000 --> 01:18.000]  is going to air in the second hour, a little bit into the third hour.
[01:18.000 --> 01:27.000]  And Rob Dude did a great job adding video clips and documents and articles to it. So it's really like a documentary.
[01:27.000 --> 01:35.000]  Extremely powerful medicine to counter the anti-human, anti-man, anti-woman, anti-child agenda.
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.000]  That is going to be premiering in the second hour today.
[01:40.000 --> 01:47.000]  Then we'll post the full interviews. You can share it at band.videoandinfowars.com.
[01:47.000 --> 01:53.000]  That said, I never do this at the beginning of a broadcast before I get to all the news, so I'm going to do it right now.
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.000]  And this is the way God works, but I got to tell you, when you watch the Democrat Party playing as lawyers,
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.000]  the last show trial they had a month ago in Texas and the new one that starts today in Connecticut
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  that I'll be up there next week in the hot seat, they get up and say, this man's worth $400 million.
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.000]  And we want to shut this man down, take his platform away.
[02:12.000 --> 02:19.000]  I am not worth $5 million if you sold my house, my cars, all the equipment we have.
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.000]  That is a lie and it's all coming out and it's all going to come out.
[02:24.000 --> 02:32.000]  That's why we filed bankruptcy because we're right on the edge of being insolvent and to prove all these numbers in these people's faces.
[02:32.000 --> 02:39.000]  But they say that because they don't want money. They got all our financials in a lawsuit. They know the truth.
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.000]  They want to shut us down.
[02:42.000 --> 02:48.000]  So, in the last year plus, because of supply chain breakdowns, we've been sold out of a lot of the products we have.
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  And in the past, when we had the products, we sold them out to be able to actually make money and even expand.
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  Well, now a lot of the products have come back in and we desperately need people to get these amazing products.
[02:58.000 --> 03:04.000]  Diet force naturally speeds up your entire metabolic system in a natural, healthy way.

[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  DNA force plus, back in stock, massively discounted.

[03:27.000 --> 03:35.000]  And green fiber capsules really should be called ultimate greens, highest quality concentrated wheatgrass and cilantro and so much more.
[03:35.000 --> 03:42.000]  Over the top, good for your intestines, your whole body, your immune system, it's back in stock, 50% off as well.
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  But here's the big announcement as we go to break.
[03:45.000 --> 03:53.000]  We had the three founder coins that were fundraiser coins, original coins I designed, made right here in America, silver one ounce rounds.
[03:53.000 --> 04:00.000]  And now we have the next in the series, not a founding member coin, but a Americana coin.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  And this is the Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena coin.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  It is a fundraiser to keep us on air and we absolutely am encouraging everybody to get it.
[04:08.000 --> 04:19.000]  It will sell out on average, they sell it in about two weeks, 1776coin.com, 1776, 1776coin.com is where you exclusively get it.
[04:19.000 --> 04:28.000]  And for all of you that want to be in the arena, that have been in the arena, this is a long term fight.
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  We're having more effect than we ever had.
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  We're under globalist attack. We cannot stand without you. We cannot stand without your support.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  So I thank you for your passport.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  I would encourage you all to get the coin.
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.000]  The man in the arena, Teddy Roosevelt, gladiator coin at 1776coin.com.
[04:43.000 --> 04:49.000]  And the markup on it again is a fundraiser. You'll have a memento and a piece of history and know you are the woman or the man in the arena.
[04:49.000 --> 04:55.000]  This is historic, 1776coin.com. Go there now and I want to thank you all for your support.
[04:55.000 --> 05:01.000]  1776coin.com. Go to infoworshore.com to get the amazing products as well.
[05:01.000 --> 05:04.000]  People ask me all the time, what is your best new tropic?
[05:04.000 --> 05:10.000]  You've got turbo force, you've got brain force plus, and you've got brain force ultra.
[05:10.000 --> 05:20.000]  Which one is better? And that's like asking, what's better, a Ford F-150 or a Cadillac or a Ferrari?
[05:20.000 --> 05:27.000]  It's different strokes for different folks. It varies. All three are different formulas. All three do different things.
[05:27.000 --> 05:34.000]  Turbo force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy. I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[05:34.000 --> 05:47.000]  Brain force plus is a long-term acting clean new tropic. This brain force ultra is a super fast acting new tropic that creates incredible clarity, but doesn't last very long.
[05:47.000 --> 05:56.000]  They're all three different formulas. And finally, back in stock, massively discounted, brain force ultra is available at infoworshore.com.
[05:56.000 --> 06:00.000]  Brain force ultra, back in stock, infoworshore.com.
[06:00.000 --> 06:13.000]  From the front lines of the information war, this is the Alex Jones show.
[06:13.000 --> 06:28.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:28.000 --> 06:36.000]  For more than 28 years, we have been on the front lines and the cutting edge of the battle against the New World Order.
[06:36.000 --> 06:46.000]  And we have had irrevocable effect against their operations. That is why we are amongst the most hated people by tyrants on Earth.
[06:46.000 --> 06:54.000]  Always faithful, never giving up, never backing down, empowered by God and empowered by the people.
[06:54.000 --> 07:03.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Monday Transmission. The big Andrew Tate interview that, believe me, is extremely powerful.
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  It's what the enemy is scared of. Learn what they're scared of. This is one of his best interviews ever, if not the best.
[07:08.000 --> 07:14.000]  And again, Rob Do and others added a bunch of B-roll and video clips and documents to the hour-long interview.
[07:14.000 --> 07:18.000]  It'll fill up the second hour and part of the third hour that we have a special guest.
[07:18.000 --> 07:26.000]  At the end of the third hour today, you do not want to miss this Monday worldwide broadcast.
[07:26.000 --> 07:32.000]  Now, let me tell you what's coming up in this hour. I got a lot of huge news here.
[07:32.000 --> 07:38.000]  The biggest vaccine news yet is just getting crazier, incredibly serious economic news.
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  The whole social credit score is going to be announced here in the U.S.
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  It's being rolled out. We'll get into that.
[07:44.000 --> 07:49.000]  More Biden staffers caught engaged in absolutely heinous activity.
[07:49.000 --> 07:56.000]  But I wanted to hit this first, not even to sell the book. The plans of the Death Star.
[07:56.000 --> 07:59.000]  But just to illustrate what a fraud we're dealing with.
[07:59.000 --> 08:03.000]  Tony Lyons of Sky Works Publishing was on with me last night.
[08:03.000 --> 08:06.000]  The biggest independent book publisher in the U.S. have a lot of courage.
[08:06.000 --> 08:14.000]  And this book, just in stores in its first week of release, sold more than 30,000 copies.
[08:14.000 --> 08:18.000]  Hundreds of thousands in pre-sell. And guess what they did?
[08:18.000 --> 08:21.000]  The New York Times said, we don't care. They've never done this before.
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.000]  They said, we're not even listing it in the New York Times best-seller list.
[08:24.000 --> 08:29.000]  Despite the fact in many lists, it was number one. In the Wall Street Journal list, it was number two.
[08:29.000 --> 08:35.000]  In other big lists, it was number two. In the USA Day list, it was number 10.
[08:35.000 --> 08:38.000]  But they count all the textbooks that are sold every August.
[08:38.000 --> 08:44.000]  So there were some textbooks ahead of us. But it was the number one book in nonfiction on USA Day's list.
[08:44.000 --> 08:50.000]  Didn't even show up on the New York Times when they talked to Tony Lyons.
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.000]  They know him well. And they said, we're not going to cover Alex Jones.
[08:55.000 --> 09:02.000]  So they tell you it's the best-seller. They give you a list of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, B.S. that can't even sell any books.
[09:02.000 --> 09:05.000]  But that's just emblematic of their fraud.
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.000]  New York Times caught rigging best-seller lists against Alex Jones, the great reset.
[09:09.000 --> 09:14.000]  The story's up on infowords.com. Number two, Wall Street Journal list.
[09:14.000 --> 09:21.000]  Number two, Publishers Weekly. Number 10, USA Day.
[09:21.000 --> 09:29.000]  Not on the New York Times, even though it's sold nearly nine times what their best-selling books did.
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  Here it is from the Wall Street Journal, actually from the Wall Street Journal.
[09:32.000 --> 09:39.000]  The great reset in the world of the world. Number two, In the World.
[09:39.000 --> 09:50.000]  There's another list. And it goes on from there because we actually show you information versus just telling you it's there and hoping you believe us like the mainstream media does.
[09:50.000 --> 09:57.000]  Like when they tell you, Trump said he hates all Mexicans and all Mexicans are criminals.
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.000]  Never said it. There's no video of it. It's a lie, but they don't care. They just keep saying it.
[10:02.000 --> 10:10.000]  Like they say, Alex Jones is white supremacist and a Nazi. Really? Where's the video? Where's the audio? You don't have it because it doesn't exist.
[10:10.000 --> 10:17.000]  You're the globalist exterminating and aborting all the babies, particularly the brown ones. You are the scum.
[10:17.000 --> 10:25.000]  And look, it's just desperation by these people because they want to, through Hollywood and the control corporate media, the dinosaur media, they want to dominate culture.
[10:25.000 --> 10:32.000]  They want to control everything. And it's that simple. And they don't want to show that freedom is popular.
[10:32.000 --> 10:42.000]  That's why when Iniesta Sousa's film, 22,000 mules was so big and the top documentary wasn't listed anywhere as in the top documentary charts.
[10:42.000 --> 10:50.000]  Because it's organized corporate fraud trying to suppress the people and their hunger for freedom, but it's not going to work.
[10:50.000 --> 10:59.000]  But why is it so important that we're on the air? Why is it so important your backing of the few LACs of truth and freedom?
[10:59.000 --> 11:07.000]  Because as things get worse and worse, as the New World Order comes out in the open, people are hungering for the truth more than ever.
[11:07.000 --> 11:16.000]  And the globalists know if we stay on air and others stay on air, we will dominate the culture war. We will win. They will go to prison.
[11:16.000 --> 11:26.000]  They will be defeated. That's why it is critical, beyond critical, essential that you continue in the face of censorship
[11:26.000 --> 11:32.000]  and everything that's going on by word of mouth, by text message, by email, by the side of your barn, the back of your car, calling you to talk radio,
[11:32.000 --> 11:38.000]  calling you to c-span, going to live events, going to speaking to city council events.
[11:38.000 --> 11:48.000]  School boards, wherever you can be heard, know whether it's by five people or a thousand or a hundred thousand or a million, you're going to win the fight.
[11:48.000 --> 11:56.000]  Go to these football games with a shirt, with a message of liberty on it. Do a banner hang. Do whatever it takes legally and lawfully,
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  but with civil disobedience to culture jam these enemies, because this is what we're really facing.
[12:01.000 --> 12:06.000]  Every week I say this is the biggest COVID news, because every week it gets crazier two and a half years into this.
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  They cooked it in the lab. They released it. It ain't a function. They lied to Congress.
[12:10.000 --> 12:17.000]  And now on infowars.com we have links to the New England Medical Journal and the Landsat British Medical Journal,
[12:17.000 --> 12:25.000]  and just you name it, prestigious universities confirming that the shots don't protect you and are causing mass death.
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.000]  We can spend a whole four-hour show just on one of these studies. Look at this one.
[12:29.000 --> 12:40.000]  50-page study says COVID vaccines worse than the disease. Link to the study on infowars.com.
[12:40.000 --> 12:48.000]  Gateway Pundit Recap. 16-month vaccine deaths exceed last 30 years on the VAERS reporting systems combined.
[12:48.000 --> 12:56.000]  COVID vaccine destroys natural immunity. NEJM study finds New England Journal Medicine. Boom!
[12:56.000 --> 13:05.000]  Does it protect you, erases your immune system and gives you VAIDS? Vaccine autoimmune acquired autoimmune deficiency disorder.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  Unbelievable. More good news. That's bad news, but good news here.
[13:09.000 --> 13:16.000]  Judge tells White House to turn over emails from KJP, the press secretary, and fouts you to social media platforms
[13:16.000 --> 13:22.000]  censoring in the last few years in accorded fashion with the White House, Big Pharma, and Big Tech.
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  Scientists and doctors exposing what is now totally confirmed that these shots are deadly.
[13:27.000 --> 13:33.000]  That's what's illegal. Yeah, Big Tech can argue they can censor. It's still wrong. They should lose the Section 230 immunity.
[13:33.000 --> 13:43.000]  But when you are colluding with the government and with the industry to suppress, that's serious trade fraud.
[13:43.000 --> 13:52.000]  That's serious criminal activity. 1,100 athletes die from sudden death from 1960-60,004.
[13:52.000 --> 13:59.000]  Now 673 have died since January 2021. See the numbers?
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.000]  And it goes on and on and on.
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  Western sued over vaccine mandates.
[14:08.000 --> 14:16.000]  Western University has no lawful authority to collect, copy, store, or use personal vaccination and medical information of students.
[14:16.000 --> 14:22.000]  But they did it illegally by letting HIPAA and so much more.
[14:22.000 --> 14:29.000]  So that's just some of the news on that front today.
[14:29.000 --> 14:35.000]  Meanwhile, and I think they should get in trouble, but they shouldn't pay 36 million. That's these trial lawyers.
[14:35.000 --> 14:45.000]  Oberlin College went along with other leftist hate crime hoax of that bakery saying they were racist at the bakery and didn't like black people.
[14:45.000 --> 14:57.000]  It was all made up by leftists in the college. The college went along with it and just paid 36 million dollars for a false flag fake racist attack like Jesse Smollett type crap.
[14:57.000 --> 15:05.000]  And they paid 36 million. I mean, you see these judgments. Everybody's going to go bankrupt. The whole society's going to collapse.
[15:05.000 --> 15:13.000]  36 million dollars. How about they put the person that staged the fake attack in jail? How about that?
[15:13.000 --> 15:20.000]  Democrat Senator compares 9-11 terrorist to January 6th rioters. We've got more on that coming up, but let's go back to this.
[15:20.000 --> 15:27.000]  Killing people in mass, nobody gets in trouble with poison shots that erase their immune system. They knew exactly what it would do before they rolled it out.
[15:27.000 --> 15:32.000]  That's how we had the documents in new. We didn't just tell you two and a half years ago before it rolled out, a year before it rolled out.
[15:32.000 --> 15:41.000]  What would happen magically would cause blood clots, heart swelling, infertility, cancer. It was in the CDC internal documents that came out.
[15:41.000 --> 15:51.000]  That's why we're on air is to continue to expose this magnitude of pure absolute evil. And that's why it's beyond critical in the fight for humanity's future that you spread the word about the live feed
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  infowars.com.
[15:53.000 --> 16:15.000]  The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass and so many other ingredients that are known to make us healthy, to make us vibrant and to defend our immune systems.
[16:15.000 --> 16:26.000]  Now, over a year and a half ago, we came out with a product that was top sourced top the line as good as going to get, but then the supply chain broke down and it was sold out for more than a year.
[16:26.000 --> 16:35.000]  Finally, green fiber capsules, this big old bottle jam packed is back in stock for a limited time at infowars.com 30% off.

[16:45.000 --> 16:55.000]  And what's just as amazing is it funds the info war and keeps us on air. We're all under globalist attack. They don't want you to have these essential nutrients that are in this product.

[16:59.000 --> 17:08.000]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular system, for your brain, for every part of your body.
[17:08.000 --> 17:18.000]  But what I don't see being promoted is the fact that it has natural psychotropic effects. It certainly does for me.
[17:18.000 --> 17:24.000]  When I take a couple of these capsules an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing.
[17:24.000 --> 17:33.000]  Now there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain, but I want you to experience it for yourself.

[17:40.000 --> 17:49.000]  But I want you to experience this high grade fish oil, this ultimate fish oil at infowars.com and see what it does if you take it before bedtime.
[17:49.000 --> 17:58.000]  Ultimate fish oil, 50% off, now exclusively available at infowars.com. Thank you all for your support. You're really going to miss out if you don't get it.
[17:58.000 --> 18:08.000]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[18:08.000 --> 18:16.000]  Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested, above organic, in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[18:16.000 --> 18:21.000]  Yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune.
[18:21.000 --> 18:26.000]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.000]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[18:30.000 --> 18:37.000]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more, per pound, and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.000]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[18:41.000 --> 18:48.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story. We had like that. I'm not saying you wouldn't believe it.
[18:48.000 --> 19:17.000]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation. And if you don't fund us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[19:17.000 --> 19:26.000]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[19:26.000 --> 19:31.000]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four-national daughter.
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.000]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well. I love to make breakfast.
[19:35.000 --> 19:44.000]  And literally, it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurturative and then all sit down together and have that communal event.
[19:44.000 --> 19:51.000]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions are coming together.
[19:51.000 --> 20:18.000]  We really are sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that want to domesticate us and turn us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue.
[20:25.000 --> 20:37.000]  We are living in insanely important times. Thank you again so much for joining us on this Monday, September 12th, 2022 broadcast.
[20:37.000 --> 20:41.000]  The tyrants of the world know they're backs against the wall.
[20:41.000 --> 20:48.000]  So they're taking the gloves off. They're accelerating their project of total enslavement and extermination.
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.000]  I mean, all you got to do is turn on the news and there's too many people. We got to depopulate everybody.
[20:53.000 --> 20:57.000]  Fall all over the world. Western governments say they're going to shut down half the farms.
[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  The place is like the Netherlands. That's the second largest food exporter in the world.
[21:02.000 --> 21:08.000]  Then they turn around like we have amnesia as things collapse and say, oh, gee, people are starving all over the world.
[21:08.000 --> 21:16.000]  There's riots everywhere. We better have a global government and a universal basic income that will fix all this.
[21:16.000 --> 21:21.000]  When the very people setting up the corporate world government are the ones behind it.
[21:21.000 --> 21:28.000]  Meanwhile, Democrat Senator compares 9-11 terrorists to January 6 rioters.
[21:28.000 --> 21:41.000]  Democrat Senator Mark Warner went on national television yesterday and used the 21st anniversary of 9-11 to absurdly compare the terrorists to attack the Twin Towers
[21:41.000 --> 21:50.000]  and the Pentagon insurgents who entered the capital on January 6. Hell, Tucky Schumer already said.
[21:50.000 --> 22:01.000]  If you remember that January 6 was worse than 9-11 and Pearl Harbor. Unbelievable.
[22:01.000 --> 22:07.000]  Then we travel over to Switzerland, Swiss social media, a buzz over a rat out your neighbor energy posters.
[22:07.000 --> 22:17.000]  It's not just three years in prison if you turn your thermostat in the winter up above 66 degrees or in the summer above 80 degrees.
[22:17.000 --> 22:24.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, they have posters everywhere saying rat out your neighbors. Nazi Germany is certainly here.
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  2.0 and that ties into this. This is out of the Guardian.
[22:28.000 --> 22:31.000]  Guns bought through credit cards in the U.S. will now be trackable.
[22:31.000 --> 22:37.000]  They don't care you go through the NICS system and the FBI, that it's bought a sporting goods store or Walmart, totally legal.
[22:37.000 --> 22:47.000]  The credit card companies have now decided outside of law that they're going to track it and create a digital code in a file on your name.
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.000]  Keeping records of what you buy and what you do.
[22:52.000 --> 22:58.000]  You know, next it'll be alcohol for the insurance companies and extra sexual habits or what diseases you have.
[22:58.000 --> 23:04.000]  Oh, we got a tracker number that you're getting medicine for HIV or you're getting medicine for heart problems.
[23:04.000 --> 23:07.000]  You're getting medicine for whatever the case is.
[23:07.000 --> 23:12.000]  And now that's valuable info that big tech can sell and use.
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  But then they're going to start though with Alex Jones.
[23:14.000 --> 23:17.000]  Oh, we're just going to censor Alex Jones and then Donald Trump and then well everybody.
[23:17.000 --> 23:22.000]  And well, now it's a social credit score through the banks that tracks what you buy and what you do.
[23:22.000 --> 23:26.000]  This is all being rolled out worldwide. It's here now.
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  Credit card purchases of firearms.
[23:28.000 --> 23:33.000]  The U.S. can now be tracked and purchases deemed suspicious can even be shared with law enforcement.
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.000]  Oh, as if you didn't do a background check with law enforcement.
[23:36.000 --> 23:42.000]  According to a new measure approved by an organization that sets parameters for business transactions.
[23:42.000 --> 23:46.000]  The international organization for standardization, part of the U.N.
[23:46.000 --> 23:52.000]  ISO voted in favor of creating a merchant code for firearms stores according to Reuters,
[23:52.000 --> 23:58.000]  which is then a code for everything else.
[23:58.000 --> 24:02.000]  A code for food, a code for oil or gas.
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  Oh, yeah, get ready to shut down that black market.
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  This is the social credit score.
[24:06.000 --> 24:16.000]  You know, Hitler made the gays wear the pink triangle and Hitler made the Jews wear the yellow star and Hitler had all the yet to wear it.
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  Your papers will get checked.
[24:18.000 --> 24:24.000]  You get caught without it. Oh, you go right to the gulag. You go right to the work camp and then off to death after that.
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  But now it's just digital.
[24:26.000 --> 24:30.000]  It's right there and it shows who you are and where you've gone and they're announcing in Australia and everywhere else.
[24:30.000 --> 24:36.000]  There's Internet IDs to get online and remember they beta tested it and this year in Australia were oh,
[24:36.000 --> 24:41.000]  we're going to just call your phone randomly to make sure you're at home.
[24:41.000 --> 24:44.000]  Citizens are only allowed out one hour a day with a mask on.
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  And if you don't answer within five minutes, we're coming to your house.
[24:47.000 --> 24:51.000]  You got to turn it on and take a screenshot. Yes, I'm at home. I'm a good slave.
[24:51.000 --> 25:03.000]  This is all dog training and the average liberal loves it and thinks they're joining some utopian Star Trek Wonder World when they're joining an absolute hell on Earth.
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  That ties into this MSN.com story.
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.000]  This robot catches grandma before she falls.
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.000]  The robot follows you around, shadows you while you sleep, while you go to the bathroom.
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.000]  It's the next level of the home assistant that spies and watches you.
[25:18.000 --> 25:24.000]  And it's a motorized wheelchair that, again, follows you around and calls the police if you fall down.
[25:24.000 --> 25:28.000]  Sounds good, but how about we just never have humans anymore because they die and get sicker?
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  How about we just put exoskeletons on the old people?
[25:30.000 --> 25:36.000]  That's the nanny state on steroids.
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  Well, we've been having blackouts here in the United States and Europe because the globals have got the power off and the power plants.
[25:41.000 --> 25:51.000]  But over in Ukraine, after they launched a major western backed offensive and did push back Russian forces in several areas, the Russians began bombing power plants.
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  They've been not targeting the infrastructure.
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  Ukraine subversed massive blackout after Russian strikes.
[25:56.000 --> 26:04.000]  And the moral of the story is this is escalating out of control very, very quickly.
[26:04.000 --> 26:11.000]  All right, I'm going to hit the fact that Biden is directly funding genocide in China.
[26:11.000 --> 26:20.000]  We pointed this out with direct taxpayer money, hundreds of billions of dollars of it in his green deal and all the rest of it that he didn't get officially passed.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  But he had added his port barrel.
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  We'll be covering that at the start of the next segment.
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  But I've got a very exciting announcement here.
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.000]  I got to say, I love the George Washington coin.
[26:34.000 --> 26:40.000]  I love the Tree of Liberty coin and I love the gun coin too, but this coin is my favorite.
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  You had the three founding member coins.
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.000]  We're going to be launching some new stuff and new exclusive things imminently.
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.000]  Well, already people that bought the founding member coins got 30% off on this new coin with a promo code.
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  We sent them some things like that.
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  But well beyond it, the deal set.
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  Things are ready.
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  A bunch of stuff is about to go down.
[26:59.000 --> 27:04.000]  But we have the freedom series of coins that are now launched.
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.000]  There are fundraisers that are collectible, that are historic to keep us on air.
[27:08.000 --> 27:09.000]  Be the man and woman in the arena.
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  Support the tip of the spear.
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.000]  The new Teddy Roosevelt citizen in a republic speech.
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  Man in the arena.
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  It is a gorgeous coin that I designed.
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  Made right here in the United States.
[27:21.000 --> 27:27.000]  One ounce 999 silver, exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[27:27.000 --> 27:32.000]  And just like folks did a great job buying the signed books, which will all be shipped out by tomorrow.
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.000]  I've been off more than I could shoot, but thank you for your support, folks.
[27:35.000 --> 27:38.000]  By Wednesday, we're going to be caught up.
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.000]  We're almost caught up as of today.
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  So thank you all for getting the signed books.
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  Can't do those anymore, but this is a silver coin.
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.000]  And it has the markup in it again to fund the operation.
[27:51.000 --> 27:55.000]  It is a collectible, only 10,000 exist and will ever exist in the world.
[27:55.000 --> 27:59.000]  This is the only Teddy Roosevelt man in the arena silver coin out there.
[27:59.000 --> 28:04.000]  It's exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  And I want to thank all you that got the past coins.
[28:06.000 --> 28:07.000]  I want to encourage those of you that haven't.
[28:07.000 --> 28:08.000]  We need the funds.
[28:08.000 --> 28:15.000]  Please don't make me prove to you how close we are to imploding by layoffs or shutting down or no, no, no.
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.000]  We are barely in the black.
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  We're in chapter five bankruptcy.
[28:18.000 --> 28:24.000]  That means if we just can be somewhat profitable and have it all overseen by a court, which we're close to having done,
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  we will then have a plan to continue on.
[28:26.000 --> 28:32.000]  No matter how big these rigged judgments are and our cruel stay employed and I will stay on air.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  Sure, I won't get paid much.
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  That's fine.
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.000]  I want to keep info wars and what we're doing going.
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.000]  I'm not going to give the enemy what they want.
[28:38.000 --> 28:41.000]  They thought they could just bankrupt things and take money away and then I would give up.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  That makes me fight that much harder.
[28:43.000 --> 28:50.000]  So 1776coin.com or PatriotCollectibles.com, please go there now and get the coin.
[28:50.000 --> 28:56.000]  1776coin.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.000]  We'll be right back with the situation here.
[28:59.000 --> 29:02.000]  People ask me all the time, what is your best at troping?
[29:02.000 --> 29:04.000]  You've got turbo force.
[29:04.000 --> 29:08.000]  You've got brain force plus and you've got brain force soldier.
[29:08.000 --> 29:09.000]  Which one is better?
[29:09.000 --> 29:18.000]  And that's like asking what's better, a Ford F-150 or a Cadillac or a Ferrari.
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.000]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[29:21.000 --> 29:22.000]  It varies.
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  All three are different formulas.
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  All three do different things.
[29:26.000 --> 29:30.000]  Turbo force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy.
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[29:32.000 --> 29:37.000]  Brain force plus is a long-term acting, clean, neutral.
[29:37.000 --> 29:44.000]  This brain force ultra is a super fast acting, neutral pick that creates incredible clarity
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.000]  but doesn't last very long.
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  They're all three different formulas.
[29:48.000 --> 29:55.000]  And finally, back in stock, massively discounted, brain force ultra is available at infowarstore.com.
[29:55.000 --> 29:59.000]  Brain force ultra back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[29:59.000 --> 30:04.000]  Ultimate fish oil is back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[30:04.000 --> 30:06.000]  What does ultimate mean?
[30:06.000 --> 30:10.000]  That's just our name for the best, the highest grade.
[30:10.000 --> 30:19.000]  What this concentrated anchovy oil, pure Arctic krill oil and high quality wild caught salmon oil does
[30:19.000 --> 30:26.000]  for your brain, your heart, your cardiovascular system and for your entire body's functions is insane.
[30:26.000 --> 30:31.000]  Regular low grade fish oil in all the studies does outstanding things.
[30:31.000 --> 30:35.000]  This is the highest grade and it's not been pasteurized.
[30:35.000 --> 30:36.000]  It's not been boiled.
[30:36.000 --> 30:39.000]  So it has its original effects intact.
[30:39.000 --> 30:45.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, everybody should visit infowarstore.com today and get ultimate fish oil
[30:45.000 --> 30:48.000]  finally back in stock for 50% off.
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  For our regular fans and our big supporters, you're going to love it.
[30:50.000 --> 30:52.000]  You already know how great it is.
[30:52.000 --> 30:56.000]  But for folks that have been on the fence, experience ultimate fish oil for yourself.
[30:56.000 --> 30:59.000]  Try taking some before bedtime and see what happens with your dreams.
[30:59.000 --> 31:05.000]  It's the fourth coin that we've released the last year and I believe the most powerful.
[31:05.000 --> 31:09.000]  The man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[31:09.000 --> 31:12.000]  Citizen of a Republic.
[31:12.000 --> 31:14.000]  The man in the arena.
[31:14.000 --> 31:17.000]  There's only 10,000 of this coin and it exists in the world.
[31:17.000 --> 31:20.000]  It will never be made again.
[31:20.000 --> 31:22.000]  It's not just an amazing historic coin.
[31:22.000 --> 31:26.000]  It funds the information war against the globalist.
[31:26.000 --> 31:28.000]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren.
[31:28.000 --> 31:30.000]  This is something you want to own.
[31:30.000 --> 31:36.000]  And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war against the globalist.
[31:36.000 --> 31:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available.
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.000]  They'll sell out very quickly.
[31:40.000 --> 31:43.000]  Please be part of history and thank you all for your support.
[31:43.000 --> 31:50.000]  You can go to 1776coin.com or you can go to patreoncollectibles.com and secure this coin.
[31:50.000 --> 31:55.000]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence and it funds the info war.
[31:55.000 --> 31:59.000]  Man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt, 1776coin.com.
[31:59.000 --> 32:07.000]  Donald Trump and the Martin Republicans represented extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic.
[32:07.000 --> 32:10.000]  I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't have an operational name.
[32:10.000 --> 32:12.000]  In fact, I bet it does.
[32:12.000 --> 32:15.000]  I bet it's called Operation Matador.
[32:15.000 --> 32:21.000]  They see us as the bull and they are shaky, a red flag in our face.
[32:21.000 --> 32:26.000]  And the Matador is the deep state with a long, skinny, razor sharp sword
[32:26.000 --> 32:31.000]  so that when the bull lunges forward, the Matador uses the force of its weight
[32:31.000 --> 32:37.000]  to drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape as the bull buries himself into the dust.
[32:37.000 --> 32:41.000]  They've got the ace of spades in their hand, which is false flags.
[32:41.000 --> 32:45.000]  Before you launch a war, you stage false flags. That's the first thing you do.
[32:45.000 --> 32:48.000]  Because nobody wants to say they started a war. Bad guys start wars.
[32:48.000 --> 32:53.000]  So every time a war gets launched by bad guys, they stage an event.
[32:53.000 --> 32:56.000]  This is Operation Matador.
[33:25.000 --> 33:30.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[33:30.000 --> 33:36.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:36.000 --> 33:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[33:40.000 --> 33:43.000]  The big Andrew Chan interview is coming up next hour and then more.
[33:43.000 --> 33:49.000]  So let's just go back and look at who the globalists are targeting, what their priorities are.
[33:49.000 --> 33:58.000]  Senator Mark Warner compares 9-11 terrorist that killed 3,000 people to January 6th rioters.
[33:58.000 --> 34:06.000]  Meanwhile, Biden has put forward hundreds of billions of dollars to pay and incentivize
[34:06.000 --> 34:10.000]  to make Americans buy electric cars, basically,
[34:10.000 --> 34:16.000]  when 80-plus percent of the electric car parts and solar panels are made in China,
[34:16.000 --> 34:19.000]  much of it by Uyghur slaves.
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.000]  Lawmakers say Biden administration may be directly funding Chinese genocide.
[34:24.000 --> 34:28.000]  There's no directly funding, maybe. They're doing it.
[34:28.000 --> 34:33.000]  Congressional Republicans want to know if the federal government is purchasing solar panels from China
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  that were built using slave labor.
[34:35.000 --> 34:38.000]  Well, not just purchasing for the federal government, they're incentivizing it for everybody.
[34:38.000 --> 34:41.000]  Lawmakers sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General,
[34:41.000 --> 34:44.000]  raised the alarm about the issue, which has come increasingly into the spotlight
[34:44.000 --> 34:47.000]  when Biden administration pushes the U.S. towards renewable energy sources.
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  They market that China dominates.
[34:49.000 --> 34:54.000]  Representative Bob Gibbs, Republican Ohio, other Republicans on the House, oversight committee,
[34:54.000 --> 34:58.000]  raised questions about China's notorious human rights violations and U.S. taxpayers
[34:58.000 --> 35:03.000]  would support unethical practices and enrich one of America's greatest rivals.
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.000]  It's not that we're not just vigilant.
[35:05.000 --> 35:13.000]  We are absolutely rolling over to this evil and then letting the left sit there and moralize
[35:13.000 --> 35:18.000]  like they have the moral high ground.
[35:18.000 --> 35:24.000]  Let's continue looking at the economics of what's unfolding from the two-plus years in the third world
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  that the countries were shut down.
[35:27.000 --> 35:32.000]  Futures jump as dollar slide accelerates.
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.000]  And that means prices are going to go up even more.
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  That's called inflation, folks, when your dollar buys less.
[35:40.000 --> 35:46.000]  Railroads enact contingency plans preparing for labor strike as union talks fail.
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.000]  EU ministers call for 10% cut in electricity consumption.
[35:50.000 --> 35:53.000]  Say, learn to wear a blanket.
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.000]  And it goes on and on.
[35:56.000 --> 36:01.000]  Economists warn energy bill price caps can lead to blackouts in the U.K.
[36:01.000 --> 36:16.000]  They snap their fingers and the whole world accelerates into a collapse.
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  And who's running our government?
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.000]  Who's running the institution?
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  This has all come out in the last few months and few weeks.
[36:27.000 --> 36:34.000]  More and more of it comes out that almost every new high-level initiative director is involved
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  in just absolutely heinous stuff.
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.000]  Satanism, pedophilia support.
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  It's par for the course because this is a legion of scum.
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.000]  A legion of filth that wants access to our children.
[36:47.000 --> 36:54.000]  Top Biden staffer, defended gay pedophilia prostitution website rated by Feds in 2015 article.
[36:54.000 --> 37:02.000]  Disgusting, Biden DOE hired, he runs the program, a man that defended pedophilia.
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  And then you look at this guy, what the hell do you expect?
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  Oh, your babysitter's here.
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.000]  Yeah, he's babysitting the nuclear material.
[37:10.000 --> 37:16.000]  I mean, oh, let's hire this person to run the nuclear program, the nuclear waste.
[37:16.000 --> 37:22.000]  Oh, let's hire this guy to run the monkeypox program into Satanism and stuff I can't even mention on air.
[37:22.000 --> 37:29.000]  Look at him, he's in charge, double giving power, seething with satanic power, he thinks.
[37:29.000 --> 37:35.000]  Biden's monkeypox are ruthlessly mocked online for photos following First Pressor.
[37:35.000 --> 37:42.000]  And the reason I covered all that is it and recapped as it ties into Timothy Comets,
[37:42.000 --> 37:48.000]  that's how you say his name, sexy bisexual cannibal, stuns Venice, bones and all,
[37:48.000 --> 37:58.000]  8.5 minute standing ovation, and reportedly, it's two men and a woman who all have sex together with each other,
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  kidnapping and killing and eating people after they torture them to death.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  Oh, it's so sexy and so cute.
[38:04.000 --> 38:08.000]  I told you where the left would lead you, cannibalism, collapse of civilization,
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  to the point of having to eat your neighbors.
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  And I said, well, we'll have to eat the left then, won't we?
[38:12.000 --> 38:15.000]  Like, eat the rich, a modest proposal, Jonathan Swift.
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.000]  And I said, this is satire, but it's where they're going to take you two years ago,
[38:19.000 --> 38:20.000]  and I was crazy.
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.000]  But now they openly admit that's exactly where we are.
[38:25.000 --> 38:28.000]  Absolutely disgusting.
[38:28.000 --> 38:35.000]  And it continues, two women, followers of an Atlantic cult, charged with murder,
[38:35.000 --> 38:41.000]  kidnapping and were they learning uncoupled from their vehicle and shot them dead because they were white.
[38:41.000 --> 38:46.000]  And that ties into all the mass shooting of whites, the kidnapping and rape of whites,
[38:46.000 --> 38:52.000]  but the left is pushing everywhere.
[38:52.000 --> 39:05.000]  Meanwhile, BLM's been caught to have $90 million extra sitting on the sideline that George Soros didn't spend manipulating our elections.
[39:05.000 --> 39:08.000]  This is who these people are.
[39:08.000 --> 39:12.000]  This is what they stand for.
[39:12.000 --> 39:18.000]  They tell you that I'm bad and Trump's bad and the Sanders is bad.
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.000]  And the truth is, I'd love to support Trump outright, but he does support the poison shots,
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  even though it's come out they don't work and hurt people.
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  But they still hate Trump because he actually hates the globalist and was fighting him.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  He just won't admit he's wrong with the shots.
[39:31.000 --> 39:38.000]  As for us, we've been against this sucker the whole time from the documents we had and knew what was happening.
[39:38.000 --> 39:44.000]  And we know what's going to happen coming up in the future if we don't get extremely aggressive about saying,
[39:44.000 --> 39:48.000]  this is a premeditated, great reset, new world order takeover.
[39:48.000 --> 39:53.000]  And as I said at the beginning of the broadcast today, the good news is all over the world,
[39:53.000 --> 40:01.000]  they are electing anti-globalist leaders and anti-globalist leaders are becoming the heads of major political parties
[40:01.000 --> 40:02.000]  and major organizations.
[40:02.000 --> 40:09.000]  And in Canada, now voted in as the head of the Conservative Party who now has the votes to unseat Trudeau,
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.000]  is a man that harps on the new world order and the deliberate great reset
[40:13.000 --> 40:18.000]  and the World Economic Forum being a criminal, corporate, fascist takeover system.
[40:18.000 --> 40:24.000]  So that is extremely, extremely important.
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  Now, since I mentioned this, we're going to play it.
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.000]  It's Senator Mark Warner compares 9-11 terrorist January 6 rioters.
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.000]  Since I mentioned it, we're going to go ahead and play this clip,
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  but I just want this to sink in with all the collapsing borders and all the exploding crime
[40:39.000 --> 40:45.000]  and all the racially motivated mass shootings on both sides and all the trouble the globalists have stirred up culturally
[40:45.000 --> 40:50.000]  and the currency imploding and the fentanyl deaths and the record suicide
[40:50.000 --> 40:55.000]  and the bankruptcies and all of it and the war with Russia.
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  And the list goes on and on.
[40:57.000 --> 41:04.000]  The number one threat and the big terrorist are the million people that showed up to protest that stolen election
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  and the thousand or so that got waved into the Capitol by the Capitol Police.
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.000]  There's a couple hundred broke through because the police stood down.
[41:13.000 --> 41:20.000]  Here he is with a further declaration of war just like Biden gave his blood red speech with the troops behind him.
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.000]  This is what they're running on with 57 days of the midterms.
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.000]  And our country came together in many ways.
[41:26.000 --> 41:32.000]  We defeated the terrorists because of the resilience of the American public because of our intelligence community.
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  And we are safer, better prepared.
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.000]  The stunning thing to me is here we are 20 years later
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.000]  and the attack on the symbol of our democracy was not coming from terrorists,
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.000]  but it came from literally insurgents attacking the Capitol on January 6th.
[41:48.000 --> 41:51.000]  So I believe we are stronger.
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  I believe our intelligence community has performed remarkably.
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.000]  I think the threat of terror has diminished.
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.000]  I think we still have new challenges in terms of nation state challenges.
[42:02.000 --> 42:07.000]  Russia in longer term, a technology competition with China.
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.000]  But I do worry about some of the activity in this country where the election deniers,
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  the insurgency that took place on January 6th.
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  That is something I hope we could see that same kind of unity of spirit.
[42:18.000 --> 42:24.000]  The insurgency, like we're in Afghanistan, the insurgents,
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.000]  knowing insurgency would have had guns and armored vehicles,
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.000]  the insurgency would have come and taken over and held the Capitol.
[42:32.000 --> 42:35.000]  But you don't even hold the Capitol to take government over.
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  It's pure crap.
[42:37.000 --> 42:38.000]  You do what the globalists do.
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.000]  You go in, you take over the government, you take over all the bureaucracies,
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  you put all the key people you want in the corporations,
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  and then you bring in your fascist tyranny.
[42:45.000 --> 42:49.000]  You take control of the credit cards and start assigning code numbers to gun owners
[42:49.000 --> 42:54.000]  outside of law, creating your own corporate list to enforce your social credit score.
[42:54.000 --> 42:57.000]  All right, big news straight ahead. Please stay with us.
[43:00.000 --> 43:03.000]  People ask me all the time, what is your best new tropic?
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  You've got Turbo Force.
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.000]  You've got Rain Force Plus, and you've got Rain Force Ultra.
[43:09.000 --> 43:10.000]  Which one is better?
[43:10.000 --> 43:19.000]  And that's like asking, what's better, a Ford F-150, or a Cadillac, or a Ferrari?
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.000]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[43:21.000 --> 43:26.000]  It varies. All three are different formulas. All three do different things.
[43:26.000 --> 43:31.000]  Turbo Force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy.
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.000]  Rain Force Plus is a long-term acting, clean, new tropic.
[43:37.000 --> 43:43.000]  This Rain Force Ultra is a super fast acting, new tropic thing.
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.000]  It creates incredible clarity, but doesn't last very long.
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  They're all three different formulas.
[43:48.000 --> 43:51.000]  And finally, back in stock, massively discounted,
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.000]  Rain Force Ultra is available at infowarstore.com.
[43:55.000 --> 44:02.000]  Rain Force Ultra back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.000]  All we've got to do is survive the crash.
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  And right now, we still have time to prepare.
[44:34.000 --> 44:38.000]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.000]  It's time to convert it into hard assets, now.
[44:41.000 --> 44:47.000]  Including food, water, and survival gear to keep us strong and at the ready.

[44:59.000 --> 45:03.000]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family,
[45:03.000 --> 45:07.000]  to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate our marriages.
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  And the studies are all clear.
[45:09.000 --> 45:15.000]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom.
[45:15.000 --> 45:19.000]  And the number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[45:19.000 --> 45:22.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this
[45:22.000 --> 45:26.000]  because they don't want people having lasting, good, loving relationships.
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  They want to break up society.
[45:28.000 --> 45:35.000]  And we are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world,

[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  And it's not just for folks that have problems in the bedroom.

[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  That's just our name for the best, the highest grade.
[46:10.000 --> 46:18.000]  What this concentrated anchovy oil, pure arctic krill oil, and high quality wild caught salmon oil
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  does for your brain, your heart, your cardiovascular system,
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  and for your entire body's functions is insane.
[46:26.000 --> 46:31.000]  Regular low grade fish oil in all the studies does outstanding things.
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  This is the highest grade.
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  It's not been pasteurized.
[46:35.000 --> 46:36.000]  It's not been boiled.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  So it has its original effects intact.
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, everybody should visit infowarstore.com today

[46:56.000 --> 47:12.000]  Try taking some before bedtime and see what happens with your dreams.
[47:12.000 --> 47:18.000]  Welcome back to the final segment of this hour, the big Andrew Tate interview is coming up.
[47:18.000 --> 47:22.000]  I want to briefly head on Russia, but first I want to get back to this because it's such a big deal.
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  We're talking a lot about this in the next few days and weeks to come because
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.000]  this is what we've got to get Congress and the Legislatures to move against.
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.000]  Guns bought through credit cards in the US will now be trackable.
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  Even though you do a background check with the federal government,
[47:36.000 --> 47:41.000]  they're creating a law enforcement file at the international organization
[47:41.000 --> 47:44.000]  for standardization via the United Nations.
[47:44.000 --> 47:50.000]  So the real translation here is UN creating global social credit score
[47:50.000 --> 47:55.000]  begins coding of products with guns and gun accessories.
[47:55.000 --> 48:03.000]  So the gun is to be tracked by a United Nations international organization.
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.000]  And then of course we've got this Ukraine suffers massive blackout after Russia strikes.
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  That war is escalating very, very quickly.
[48:09.000 --> 48:13.000]  We're in direct conflict with Russia right now and we need this to end.
[48:13.000 --> 48:19.000]  We need to pray for peace and a global awakening because this is all part of the concerted globalist operation.
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  And they pushed Russia into this war.
[48:21.000 --> 48:27.000]  I wish Russia wouldn't have done it, but now it's going on and Russia took debate.
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.000]  And I warned it was a setup and there's US troops over there fighting the Russians.
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.000]  And this is so dangerous, ladies and gentlemen, but that's why we're here on air.
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  That's why it's so precious.
[48:36.000 --> 48:41.000]  What you do is spreading the word about this broadcast because we cut through the left-right paradigm.
[48:41.000 --> 48:42.000]  We cut to populism.
[48:42.000 --> 48:48.000]  We cut right to the heart of what we're facing, a designed global forced depopulation.
[48:48.000 --> 48:56.000]  Let me play a short clip from the interview that's going to premiere next hour with the most Google man in the world, Andrew Tate.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  Then we've got a special Greg Reese report and more.
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  Please stay with us, infowars.com.
[49:00.000 --> 49:01.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[49:04.000 --> 49:11.000]  It's been a very interesting few years and we've seen what happens when people don't have a voice and don't stand up and try and repel against these systems.
[49:11.000 --> 49:18.000]  I really do think that the acts that have happened across these last few years in the name of trying to save lives for COVID have been genuinely, genuinely criminal.
[49:18.000 --> 49:25.000]  And I don't think they would have tested this kind of system or tested this kind of censorship and repression to just stop it and go back to normal.
[49:25.000 --> 49:34.000]  I think it was a test of a system and they intend on coming in harder than ever before with some new story and some new excuse later on down the line.
[49:34.000 --> 49:40.000]  And it gets to a point where you finally have to stand up and realize that you cannot run from what is going to come to you.
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  You cannot escape it.
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.000]  You cannot hide.
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  You cannot deny it.
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  You get to a point where you understand you need to find people who are like minded and stand up.
[49:47.000 --> 49:55.000]  And the best way you can stand up at this current point in time is just to educate others and just to highlight the injustices which are being purported by these systems.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  My banning was absolutely not the unjust.
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  I never broke any terms of service.
[49:59.000 --> 50:04.000]  They know that the whole world knows that now and the public sentiment is on my side.
[50:04.000 --> 50:14.000]  And the more people talk about this and the more people discuss this and tell others and educate others, the harder it's going to be for them to keep this curtain, this iron curtain of theirs over the truth.
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  Because that's all they truly want to do.
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  Everyone knows this saying and it's completely and utterly true.
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.000]  And we're now in a situation where they have absolute power.
[50:24.000 --> 50:31.000]  But I do believe that we're moving to a transitional period, a transitional place, and you've been a massive leader in that force.
[50:31.000 --> 50:38.000]  And even now, as much as they say you're banned, anybody who types your name into a lot of these matrix led platforms can still find videos of you.
[50:38.000 --> 50:43.000]  So they can't completely and utterly shut you up because people want to listen to what you have to say.
[50:43.000 --> 50:44.000]  People want to hear you.
[50:44.000 --> 50:50.000]  And it's for that reason that they fear you because they try and take men like us to lead us and replace us with these talking heads.
[50:50.000 --> 50:55.000]  But humans have an instinct and that instinct allows us to feel affinity with somebody.
[50:55.000 --> 51:01.000]  They can hear your voice or mine and know they want to hear what we have to say because they know we have character and we're integral and we have morals.
[51:01.000 --> 51:04.000]  These talking heads don't have any of that.
[51:04.000 --> 51:08.000]  So when they put them there to read from the hymn sheet, it simply doesn't resonate with the youth of today.
[51:08.000 --> 51:15.000]  And that's how I managed to become the most Google man on the planet by just telling men the truth about the experience they're going through and the life they're going to live.
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  It's a really interesting period of human time.
[51:17.000 --> 51:23.000]  And I've really been appreciative also of your support and the support of the other mainstream characters who stood up and said, listen, this is going on long enough.
[51:23.000 --> 51:36.000]  On April 23, 1910, the iconic American president who busted up the Rockefeller Trust in America gave his incredibly historic speech, Citizen in a Republic.
[51:36.000 --> 51:41.000]  It was the man in the arena speech that sent shockwaves throughout the world.
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  And I live by this creed.
[51:43.000 --> 51:53.000]  I'm about to read to you just a short excerpt of the 30 plus minute speech he gave over 5 million attendees in Paris, France.
[51:53.000 --> 52:04.000]  We have released a coin that has Teddy Roosevelt on the front and the gladiator on the back discusses a Citizen in the Republic and the man in the arena.
[52:04.000 --> 52:11.000]  And in full wars, everything we do is about the man and the woman in the arena fighting tyranny.
[52:11.000 --> 52:18.000]  It's the fourth coin in the series we've offered at PatriotCollectibles.com or 1776coin.com.
[52:18.000 --> 52:22.000]  There are only 10,000 of this coin available.
[52:22.000 --> 52:28.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this coin is funding our operations as men and women in the arena.
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.000]  Let me read to you part of his famous speech.
[52:31.000 --> 52:39.000]  It's not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man has stumbled or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[52:39.000 --> 52:45.000]  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood,
[52:45.000 --> 52:52.000]  who strives valiantly, who errors, who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming,
[52:52.000 --> 52:57.000]  but who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotions,
[52:57.000 --> 53:05.000]  who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at worst, if he fails,
[53:05.000 --> 53:13.000]  at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be amongst the cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.
[53:13.000 --> 53:17.000]  This is the man in the arena coin, only 10,000 in the world.

[53:23.000 --> 53:34.000]  Everyone says that today the royal family is nothing more than a ceremonial figure,
[53:34.000 --> 53:42.000]  even though they choose the government, have final approval over all legislation and own half the country.
[53:42.000 --> 53:51.000]  And so while we remember Queen Elizabeth, let us not forget how this incestuous family has used their own children to gain power.
[53:51.000 --> 54:01.000]  Parliamentary lawfare over trading rights between England and Scotland led to the first iteration of the United Kingdom in 1707
[54:01.000 --> 54:09.000]  and created the legal groundwork for George of Hanover to be crowned King of England in Ireland in 1714.
[54:09.000 --> 54:19.000]  He was 55 years old, married to his first cousin and didn't speak any English because he was from the German House of Hanover.
[54:19.000 --> 54:26.000]  The English people were not happy about this and his coronation was met with riots all across the country,
[54:26.000 --> 54:34.000]  followed by years of rebellions. His grandson, King George III, inspired the American Revolution.
[54:34.000 --> 54:43.000]  And when his granddaughter Victoria married her first cousin, Prince Albert, the House of Saxe, Coburg and Gotha took sway over the country.
[54:43.000 --> 54:51.000]  Throughout the First World War, the people of England were questioning the loyalty of the German bloodlines who ruled over them,
[54:51.000 --> 54:57.000]  which prompted the royal family to change their name to Windsor in 1917.
[54:57.000 --> 55:05.000]  Nine years later, Queen Elizabeth was born, who was initiated into the Druid Order in 1946,
[55:05.000 --> 55:14.000]  married Prince Philip of Nazi bloodlines in 1947 and gave birth to Charles in 1948.
[55:14.000 --> 55:23.000]  In 2010, William Coombs, survivor of Canada's infamous residential schools where the mass graves of children were found,
[55:23.000 --> 55:31.000]  claimed to have witnessed Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip visit the Cam Loops Residential School in 1964,
[55:31.000 --> 55:36.000]  where they took ten of the children away with them, never to return.
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.000]  A year later, William Coombs dies in the hospital.
[55:40.000 --> 55:50.000]  In 1988, Prince Philip told the German press that he hopes to be reincarnated as a deadly virus to help with the population problem.
[55:50.000 --> 55:56.000]  And his son, King Charles, likes to joke on television how he is related to Dracula.
[55:56.000 --> 56:02.000]  His royal highness, Prince Charles, who can trace his ancestry back to Romania's dark and distant past.
[56:02.000 --> 56:09.000]  The genealogy shows that I'm descended from Vlad the Impale, so I do have a bit of a stake in the country.
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  As it were.
[56:11.000 --> 56:20.000]  These royals are the result of an incestuous breeding program wherein children were used as a way to gain power over the masses.
[56:20.000 --> 56:28.000]  So it's no surprise that they are caught up with the likes of Jeffrey Epstein, who made a living using children to leverage power.
[56:28.000 --> 56:38.000]  And Jimmy Savile, who had unfettered access to rape hundreds of children inside NHS hospitals, and was a dear friend of King Charles.
[56:38.000 --> 56:43.000]  Along with Klaus Schwab, King Charles is a founder of the Great Reset.
[56:43.000 --> 56:53.000]  He's as green as Greta Thunberg, and last year he announced the need for a military-style campaign to bring the world to zero emissions.
[56:53.000 --> 57:03.000]  Here we need a vast military-style campaign to marshal the strength of the global private sector, with trillions at his disposal.
[57:03.000 --> 57:18.000]  Far beyond global GDP, and with the greatest respect, beyond even the governments of the world's leaders, it offers the only real prospect of achieving fundamental economic transition.
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.000]  So, how do we do it?
[57:21.000 --> 57:29.000]  We know how they'll do it, by cutting off Europe's fuel and forcing the people back into the 1700s.
[57:29.000 --> 57:35.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[57:35.000 --> 58:04.000]  The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass and so many other ingredients that are known to make us healthy, to make us vibrant, and to defend our immune systems.
[58:04.000 --> 58:15.000]  Now, over a year and a half ago, we came out with a product that was top sourced, top of the line, as good as it's going to get, but then the supply chain broke down and it was sold out for more than a year.
[58:15.000 --> 58:24.000]  Finally, green fiber capsules, this big old bottle, jam-packed, is back in stock for a limited time at Infowarsstore.com, 30% off.
[58:24.000 --> 58:35.000]  And this limited time left time to go into all the great things it does or what it has inside, but go to Infowarsstore.com and look up green fiber capsules for yourself and see how amazing it is.
[58:35.000 --> 58:39.000]  And what's just as amazing is, it funds the Infowar and keeps us on air.
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  We're all under globalist attack.
[58:41.000 --> 58:44.000]  They don't want you to have these essential nutrients that are in this product.
[58:44.000 --> 58:49.000]  Get yours today at 25% off at Infowarsstore.com, now back in stock.
[58:49.000 --> 58:55.000]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire.
[58:55.000 --> 58:59.000]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[58:59.000 --> 59:00.000]  You see it every year.
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[59:02.000 --> 59:05.000]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[59:05.000 --> 59:15.000]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this show.
[59:15.000 --> 59:20.000]  It's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[59:20.000 --> 59:26.000]  To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.
[59:26.000 --> 59:31.000]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[59:31.000 --> 59:46.000]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-900-4285.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  Well, I'm known as the most controversial...
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  in America, probably the world, except now somebody's giving me a really good run for my money.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  And he's a good friend of mine.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  He's a good friend of Potson.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  We've hung out.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  He's been on the show many times.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  He's hosted the show.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  He's Andrew Tate, the most searched individual in the last six months on the Internet every single day.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  And he is just on fire with the young people with a really good, strong, pro-human message that completely threatens the power structure because they want us to be weak.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  They want us to be victims.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  And Andrew Tate is the opposite.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  But what really freaks people out is that their daughters are listening to Andrew Tate.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  I was having dinner a few days ago with another good friend of mine that's a well-known podcaster.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  And he brought up Andrew Tate and he said, yeah, it's really crazy.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  My daughters are big fans and those are high school daughters.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  So Andrew Tate has absolutely, massively and had a gigantic effect and the power structure is insanely scared of him.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  Now, if he was a bad guy and had this much influence and they didn't control him, they'd be coming after him.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  But he's a good guy with incredible pull and that scares them to their very core.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  And that's why this hour-long interview uncensored is so critical.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  Andrew Tate being able to speak for himself because now he's become one of the most banned men in the world.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  There's only a few other people out there.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  Donald Trump is one of them.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  I'd say in the top three most banned people in the world, it's Andrew Tate, Alex Jones and Donald Trump.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  That's why this interview is so incredibly important.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  We're in a club.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  It's a pretty elite club and it's because we scare the establishment.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  Andrew Tate, great to have you here, my friend.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  Absolutely glad to be here and that's a pretty good club to be part of.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  So I'm almost happy for the membership.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  Where to start?
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  The ban?
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  What you're going through?
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  What's unfolding?
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  What's coming next?
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  We're getting into so much here today.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  Yeah, it was the Matrix attacked me.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  I knew they always would.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  They attacked in a very clever manner.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  I received a strike on YouTube, which prevents you from posting for seven days.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  After I received the strike, Metta banned me, which is Instagram and Facebook.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  They banned me.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  I filmed a YouTube video to reply to the ban while I still had my YouTube account because
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  they're pretending they're fair and that it all doesn't happen in sync.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  They allowed my YouTube account to survive for four more days and then they banned my YouTube account.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  So the strike was given to me on purpose to make sure that I couldn't post my reply video
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  directly after the first ban and for them to pretend that there was some kind of degree
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  of separation between the large Matrix attacks.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  I've been banned on basically every single platform from Airbnb to Uber through to social
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  media platforms, payment processors, absolutely everything.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  And you're completely right.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  I teach people and inspire people to think for themselves and that makes you the enemy
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  of the establishment because you are not allowed to think.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  You're only allowed to comply.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  Let's walk through that because before we started this interview today, you said the
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  most important point is once they silence you, then they can tell whatever lies about you.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  You're not just put the Phantom Zone.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  Now they can misrepresent who you are.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  Absolutely.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  And that's the number one intention, right?
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  Because when these large companies decide to ban somebody, they also monitor in real
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  time public perception, social media comments and posts and how people feel about their
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  decision.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  So to make sure they don't look tyrannical after they ban you, they use the media machine
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  to lie about you and paint a narrative that you're the worst person in the world to try
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  and convince the populace that your ban was actually a good thing.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  So they can get away with their actions unscathed.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  The lives are a very, very important part of their plan.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  They're always pre-orchestrated and they come in hard and fast and heavy across every single
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  mainstream media outlet in real time.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  As soon as you've been banned, you can no longer defend yourself.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  You are defenseless.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  And what you just said is so incredibly critical and that's why they're scared of you.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  When they began their purge of info wars in August of 2018, Tim Cook later bragged that
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  he met that Sunday night with the heads of the big six tech companies.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  That's how important the censorship is.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  We think that what the user wants is someone that does review these apps.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  Someone that does review the podcasts.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  Someone that on like Apple news were a human.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  and so many other ingredients that are known to make us healthy, to make us vibrant
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  and to defend our immune systems.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  Now over a year and a half ago, we came out with a product that was top sourced,
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  top the line as good as it's going to get, but then the supply chain broke down
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  and it was sold out for more than a year.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  Finally, green fiber capsules.

[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  We're all under globalist attack.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  They don't want you to have these essential nutrients that are in this product.

[1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  Now back in stock.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  Tim Cook later bragged that he met that Sunday night with the heads of the big six tech companies.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  That's how important the censorship is.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  We think that what the user wants is someone that does review these apps.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  Someone that does review the podcasts.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  Someone that on like Apple news where a human is selecting the top stores.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  But at what point were you like, okay, that's it.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  Alex Jones has to go.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  We get into a singular kind of event.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  But I think there's enough there that reasonable people could agree that if you're going to curate, that that should be all.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  And it wasn't just about Alex Jones who's about to take this precedent
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  and how they first decided to have YouTube shut me down.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  First was the strike so we could respond.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  It's all very strategic.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  This is admitted by the way. Cook's give interviews.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  To Vice and you name it.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  In terms of power, I've never felt like I had any power.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  Then Facebook, Instagram, all of the major sites, over 60 of them even linked in,
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  then banned me two days after the YouTube strike and it was all very, very strategic.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  And this is a battle plan and they now admit it's a battle plan,
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  which they later used on Donald Trump as well.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  And now they're using it's millions of not just Americans, but people all over the world.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  And we see the videos in Europe and in the UK where the man criticizes transgenderism
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  and puts up a transgender flag with swastika on it and they come and arrest the veteran at his home.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  So whatever you see being done to and rotate now it shows that Donald Trump today will end up being done to you.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  This is a blueprint where they pick out the alpha males that they see on the vanguard
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  because they're really coming after everybody else.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  Absolutely. That's the first thing they want to do. You're right.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  They destroy the people who can inspire resistance amongst the populace
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  and they need to control the narrative.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  These people are who I call, I often use the popular movie as an easy way to characterize and explain my mindset.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  I call them the Matrix and they are the Matrix because they purport a false version of reality
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  for people to subscribe to so they can be drained of their resource and use.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  And they literally paint a false reality and the reason they're able to do that
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  is because everyone who counters that reality, they attempt to delete in real time.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  They just did it with COVID. They convinced people that something was happening
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  that literally wasn't even happening in real time.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  And the reason they didn't manage to get away with it for so long
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  is because every time you spoke up and told the truth and talked about what you see with your own eyes
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  and hear with your own ears, you're silenced.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  They need to control the world and control how people think.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  And we are a threat to that.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  And that's how the gaslighting works.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  So let's expand on that for people that don't know what it's like to be unpersoned.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  And this is a forte or this is a first look at what's going to happen
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  under the Global Social Credit Score they've set up.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  They came after your banking, your credit cards, your processing.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  Describe for people, not as a victim as you've said, but as a warrior at the front of the fight,
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  how the enemy's going to attack so people behind us in the fight know what's coming.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  Yeah, first thing they want to do is they want to hurt your money.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  So they destroy your processing, your banking, anything that involves money.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  They're going to start being put under review or deleted and disabled in real time.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  Shortly after you're right, the social media platforms ban you.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  First, one bans you.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  The other ones usually wait a day or two, but they put in a strike
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  so you cannot reply and use the platform.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  They put in a day or two gap to try and pretend that they're not all doing it in succinct.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  And after that, it comes in hard and fast.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  From Airbnb to Uber to Discord to Gmail accounts to absolutely anything and everything.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  They just start annihilating in real time, wiping them off the face of the planet.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  And you have no recourse.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  While they are doing this, they ensure that their media machine is telling it the biggest lies
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  and gaslighting the public into believing you're genuinely dangerous and deserve what's happening to you.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  This is a big part of it.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  They need the populace to believe that you deserve this treatment.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  So they elaborate, they exaggerate, they choose small portions of things you said.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  They take things out of context and they attack you absolutely so that people at home sit and go,
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  wow, this bad person should be deleted for my safety.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  The amount of people I see who are like, free speech, let's not ban Tate,
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  or a lot of the stuff I say is, I don't like Tate,
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  but I believe in not censoring people in free speech.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  It's all men.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  He is saying vile stuff that I'm a woman.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  You're not. It doesn't affect you.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  There is a whole other problem about unilaterally banning somebody
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  the way these platforms work together to ban somebody overnight, completely remove them.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  The way that I see it and you Tate, because I'm very aware of...
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  You might know more than...
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  Yeah, because I don't know...
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  Maybe, right? Maybe, possibly.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  I see him as a hate group.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  He's saying stuff like that women are the property of their boyfriend or husband, whatever it is.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  Ultimately, what he advocates is for violence against women.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  If you take into context also that he's done sex trafficking, does it change your...
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  Well, listen, 100% if he's doing sex trafficking, then that's...
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  They convince the people of the world that the only way they can be safe is if people like us don't exist,
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  when nothing could be further from the truth.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  And what you said again is beyond critical.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  The globalists even brag about this.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  They have the head of YouTube get up and say,
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  yeah, my son likes Alex Jones, so I worked with her big tech to banning.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  I decided you don't get to see him.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  And Tim Cook said, we curated like a museum, you know, Alex Jones put him in the Phantom Zone.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  It's all coordinated and that's what makes it illegal.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  Yeah, they can argue that we're utilities, but we're so allowed to ban people.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  We're private companies.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  But once they coordinate with the federal government and with Interpol
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  and with European nations and the communist Chinese and others,
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  now it's government and that is illegal in every western nation.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  That's why lawsuits have been filed against Twitter, Facebook and others,
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  because even Zuckerberg went on Joe Rogan two weeks ago and admitted.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  He said, yeah, the FBI said, don't put out the Hunter Biden story.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  It's this info, which we all knew it was true.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  It was true then.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  And so they censored billions of users for being able to see that info because the FBI said so.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  That's the government in direct, the deep state in direct collusion with big tech.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  If that isn't authoritarianism, if that isn't tyranny, nothing is.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  Well, that's how tyranny works.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  One of the key components to tyranny is you have to remove all opposing sides of an argument.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  And that's basically the easiest way to tyranny.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  This is what people don't understand.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  If you have two sides of an argument, regardless, even the people who disagree with me,
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  I think they should have a platform should be allowed to speak so that we can find a way
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  to make sure that all of our discourse and all of our narratives are tested and battleground tested
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  and we have a chance to explain ourselves.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  When you remove the other side and live in an echo chamber,
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  nobody needs to have any kind of logical explanation or logical grounding for their thoughts.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  And that's how it's very, very easy and quick to grind into complete and our tyranny.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  Look what happened in the last three years.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  Nobody was allowed to stand up and say these lockdown measures of draconian,
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  these lockdown measures are out of control,
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  and they're genuinely damaging people more than the virus itself because nobody was allowed to say that.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  Look what we spiraled into.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  We spiraled into a situation where, like you said, the government broke their own law,
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  broke the own laws of the Constitution to protect us against basically everything
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  and destroy people's lives in real time.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  I don't believe that the lockdown measures have been legal in a single country.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  They were implemented.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  How could they be?
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  Well, that's right.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  And they say there's science, but everything they said was a lie.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  I use the Hunter Biden laptop.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  The COVID censorship of Ivor Mectin that they knew worked,
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  they confirm major studies works, the censorship of other treatments,
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  the ventilators, they're not letting family in to see their parents in nursing homes,
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  but sending sick people in.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  Everything they did claiming that the vaccine is 100% effective.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  Now they admit it doesn't work.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  Nine out of 10 dying have been triple jabbed.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  I mean, they really have proven that they're in a war against science,
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  and science is questioning.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  Science is challenging.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  That's what freedom is.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  Real science is freedom.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  And as you said, they need a echo chamber where they can just brainwash people
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  or a matrix, a false reality bubble they put people in.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  But we were talking before we went on air today,
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  you want to talk about the Great Awakening.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  You were telling me they're losing.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  Yeah, I think that there's massive pressure behind the dam
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  that people are starting to wake up and understand that these people are tyrannical.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  And the only thing that's missing, the only crack that has been missing for a long time
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  is the fact that once you've been depersoned,
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  a lot of people are genuinely fearful of it
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  because they don't feel like they can maintain mainstream consciousness.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  You've done very, very well.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  I'm now going to do very, very well myself.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  And as we continue to lead the world to show that even without these platforms,
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  you can stay relevant, respected, and still reach your audience,
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  then that's going to put the crack in the dam,
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  and I believe the pressure is going to do the rest,
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  and it's going to finally explode and blow open.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  People are tired of being told what they're allowed to hear
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  and what they're allowed to think.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  On all sides of the spectrum,
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  I like to believe that people are tired of this,
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  and it doesn't matter what kind of monopoly you hold.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  Every single monopoly in history believed they had ultimate power
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  and would never, ever, ever lose control.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  The Roman Empire did. The Mongol Empire did.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  This tech empire does.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  And sooner or later, when you're too tyrannical
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  and you piss off populations, there is revolution.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  The world up until this point was based on freedom.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  How they advertised you to be a good slave
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  was they would give you some freedom.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  And when I say slave, I use that word particularly
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  because a slave used to work his ass off
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  and he would get food and a house in return.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  And 99% of people out here, my friend, are...
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  People ask me all the time,
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  what is your best new tropic?
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  You've got turbo force.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  You've got brain force plus,
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  and you've got brain force ultra.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  Which one is better?
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  And that's like asking, what's better?
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  A Ford F-150, or a Cadillac, or a Ferrari.
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  It varies. All three are different formulas.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  All three do different things.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  Turbo force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy.
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  Brain force plus is a long-term acting, clean, new tropic.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  This brain force ultra is a super fast acting, new tropic thing.
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  It creates incredible clarity, but doesn't last very long.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  They're all three different formulas.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  And finally, back at stock, massively discounted,
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  brain force ultra is available at infowarstore.com.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  Brain force ultra, back at stock, infowarstore.com.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  It's the fourth coin that we've released the last year.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  And I believe the most powerful.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  The man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  The citizen of a republic.
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  The man in the arena.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  There's only 10,000 of this coin.
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  It exists in the world.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  It will never be made again.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  It's not just an amazing historic coin.
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  It funds the information war against the globalist.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  This is something you want to own.
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war against the globalist.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available.
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  They'll sell out very quickly.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  Please be part of history.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  And thank you all for your support.

[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  Man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  1776coin.com
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  does fantastic things for your cardiovascular system,
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  for your brain, for every part of your body.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  But what I don't see being promoted is the fact that
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  it has natural psychotropic effects.
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  It certainly does for me.
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  When I take a couple of these capsules from an hour before bed,
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  my sleep, my dreams are amazing.
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  Now there are actually some studies out there
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  linking it to amazing events in the brain.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  But I want you to experience it yourself.

[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  99% of people out here, my friend,
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  are working their asses off.
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  They can buy food in the house.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  That's it.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  Most people are still slaves.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  They would tell you,
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  you're going to be a slave,
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  but you'll be free at least.
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  You know, you can do what you want.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  You can think what you want.
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  You can say what you want.
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  You can walk around outside,
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  look at the trees.
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  You're a slave, but you're free.
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  Freedom, freedom, freedom.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  And what happened when they did this,
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  something changed.
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  The internet came.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  People started to talk.
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  People started to think.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  People started to realize how money's made.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  People started to realize it's all a scam.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  Cryptocurrency was invented.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  Now you have Bitcoin,
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  which is surpassing the global reserve currency.
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  We don't need banks anymore.
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  We don't need the IMF anymore.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  People are starting to talk.
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  People have elected Trump,
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  a man who's not bought and controlled by the establishment.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  People are starting to actually get their minds right.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  So the people in charge are like,
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  oh, fuck, we're losing control.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  We no longer control the money.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  We no longer control who's in charge of each country.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  Oh, we've got to put an end to this.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  We can no longer base our societies on freedom.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  We must base our societies on safety.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  You can't think for yourself.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  We can't put these videos on YouTube
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  because it's fake news and it's dangerous.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  You can't go outside because of the virus and it's dangerous.
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  You can't travel in between countries without that injection
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  because it's dangerous.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  This is no longer about freedom, my friends.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  This is about your safety.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  They're going to take all your freedom away
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  and instead they're going to do a nice big helping of safety
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  and you're going to take it and go, oh, at least I'm safe.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  You were safer before.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  You were safer before
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  because now the government can arrest you
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  for saying something you don't like
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  because now you're spreading fake news.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  You were safer when you could have an opinion.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  Well, that's right.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  I'm not a world champion kickboxer like you,
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  but I certainly learned growing up in Dallas
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  where it was rough and tumble
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  that a lot of people start a fight with you and hit you
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  and then they would stand back and wait for you to fall over.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  But if you didn't fall over,
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  well, then you were on top of them and they were losing.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  And what the globalists do is they attack us.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  They demonize us and they expect us to bind to the narrative
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  that, oh, it's over for us.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  But if you just keep fighting, the human instinct sees that
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  and has a real desire, a fiery lust to be part of that.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  And so by us not giving up,
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  even if we're destroyed like the Alamo,
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  we inspire others for the overall victory of our species.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  And I think that's where we're going to win in the end.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  The globalists think we're like them where if they were attacked
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  or they were bullied or they were demonized,
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  they would go away because they're followers.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  They joined the globalists, this hierarchical system.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  They don't understand that we don't give up when we're attacked.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  We just attack harder.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  How would you quantify that phenomenon?
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  No, you're completely and utterly right.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  We are men of old and leaders of old used to charge first into battle.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  We don't send other people's sons and kids to go die in war
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  and hide in a nice cushy office ourselves.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  No, men of old, we got on a horse and we charged in front of our armies
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  and we're a different caliber of man.
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  And that's why we have independent thoughts in the first place.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  You're right. We never subscribed.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  We never sold our souls.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  We developed independent thoughts that allowed us to think for ourselves
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  and come to our own conclusions,
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  despite the fact that there are large groups of people that told us
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  we are completely and utterly wrong.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  And we have the kind of personality and persuasion
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  and also charisma to convince others and inspire others to charge at the enemy.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  And that's exactly what they're scared of.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  Well, I'm going to go ahead and tell a story here
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  and I'm not going to name names because I don't want to embarrass anybody,
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  but I had problems when I was a teenager too.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  I'm not perfect.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  But I have somebody very close to me that got into being a victim.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  They were still great, but felt sorry for themselves
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  and just was caught up in the system
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  and had girlfriends that were liberal and just that whole sick society.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  And I couldn't wake them up with my pep talks.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  I couldn't get them to make the leap into being a real man
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  when they had such incredible potential
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  and literally listening to you the last eight months or so
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  because I'm really busy, stuff's going on.
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  I watch your clips. I love you.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  I wasn't really paying attention.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  And someone very close to me said,
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  Andrew Tate, he's amazing. He's waking me up.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  He's doing all this. You know, he's number one.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  He's incredible.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  I'm like, yeah, I know Andrew. He's wonderful.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  And then I just saw this total change the last eight months
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  and this person's very close to me thanks to you.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  And it's invaluable and it's a total difference.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  It's like night and day.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  How do people get out of the mind control they're under?
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  Why are you so popular with the young people?
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  And how do adults watching this send their young people to you?
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  They go, oh, it's brash. Oh, it's this.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  Well, that's what humanity is.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  And sure, you may be what they call extreme
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  because we're so domesticated.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  But really, a thousand years ago, you'd just be normal.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  You'd be a normal alpha male. You'd be a normal leader.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  So how do we take the success you've had
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  that scares the hell out of them
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  in getting young girls and boys, teenagers, college people
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  to really break the spell?
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  Because you've been doing it.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  And I think that's what they're scared of
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  because there's a huge swath of the population
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  that aligns with my messaging.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  And the reason they fear it is because
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  I'm speaking to the youth of the world
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  and telling them that the way they've been feeling
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  when they've been feeling like they've been disaffected
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  and forgotten about is not their fault.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  They try and delete me and replace me with some puppet
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  like Logan Paul or James Charles
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  or one of these mouthpieces.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  And nobody feels affinity to these people
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  because they know they're not brave.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  They know that they sold their souls
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  and they know that they're just parrots
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  which are repeating what they've been told to say.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  I am inspiring the youth by actually standing up
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  and talking about the issues which are true to them
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  and they see that my reality is a reality
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  they want to emulate.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  And when you're a young man and you see a man
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  whose life you want, you're very likely to listen
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  to his thoughts and opinions on how he should get there.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  That's all I'm doing.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  And I'm leading by example
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  and that's what they're truly, truly fearful of.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  They don't want me to make people to feel better.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  We're talking about your friend.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  I made your friend feel better.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  That's what they want.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  They don't want that.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  They don't want people to feel better.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  They don't want anyone to feel good.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  They don't want anyone to think.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  They don't want anyone to have their own independent thoughts.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  They don't want any of that.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  What they want is mindless, soulless slaves
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  who are so depressed
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  they can't think about anything outside of themselves
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  and they're busy popping medication
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  and sitting around in a room
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  in between shifts at their slave job.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  That's all they want.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  And they find me as a threat.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  They think I'm a threat to the system
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  purely because I encourage young men to get strong,
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  train hard, find some brothers who they can rely on
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  and think for themselves.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  Well, that's it.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  And you said it.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  Aspire to something.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  Young people aren't aspiring to anything.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  The left teaches them to be lazy,
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  to be victims, to be depressed.
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  And that's cool.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  No.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  When you're fighting in a business or for your family
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  or for your life
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  or getting up to go to your friend's house
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  when they need your help
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  and them helping you,
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  that's the real brotherhood, the sisterhood,
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  the human community of being a clan.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  And we're one human species that needs those goals.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  And so people need to aspire
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  and say, I want to be successful
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  because it's not even getting to the success that matters.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  It's aspiring to it.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  It's what you're supposed to do
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  because you've got to have a purpose-driven life
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  and a mission.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  And these young people need a mission
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  and you're giving them a mission.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  Absolutely.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  And what's actually interesting
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  is this extremely hypocritical
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  because when the shit hits the fan,
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  when they need soldiers to go die in a war,
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  when they need firemen
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  to charge into a burning building,
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  when they need police officers
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  to hopefully save children in a school shooting
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  and not just stand outside,
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  when they need real men to go do real things,
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  then they call on the men like me
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  and the men who think like me.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  Then they want the men who are brave,
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  who are masculine,
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  who have tenets of masculinity,
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  who have honor, who have duty.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  Then they want us.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  But as soon as they don't want us
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  to go risk our lives to protect them,
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  they say we're not allowed opinion,
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  we're not allowed to think,
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  we're not allowed to talk
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  and we should be depersoned and deleted.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  They try and use us.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  Absolutely not early
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  because society needs men like us
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  and I'm the one who's been speaking up for them.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  They also pretend they give a shit
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  about men's mental health.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  You told me one example
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  about how I helped your friend.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  I have hundreds of thousands of emails
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  for young men I've helped
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  and older men who I've helped
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  with their mindset
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  and helped with their approach towards life.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  I have genuinely changed the lives
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  of hundreds of thousands of people
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  for the better.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  They talk about giving a shit about men
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  and giving a shit about men's mental health
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  while deleting me,
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  the person who helps them the most
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  and saying they're going to replace me
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  with some algorithm matrix agent bot
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  like Logan Paul,
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  who nobody respects
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  and doesn't want to listen to.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  It's bullshit.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  If they gave a shit about men's mental health,
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  they'd leave me up there to inspire the youth.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  They don't care.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  All they care about is narrative control.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  And we're going to dive into Andrew Tate.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  I don't feel like platforming this guy.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  I don't feel like giving him the blessing of...
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:28:59.000]  People ask me all the time,
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  what is your best new tropic?
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  You've got turbo force,
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  you've got brain force plus
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  and you've got brain force ultra.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  Which one is better?
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  And that's like asking
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  what's better,
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  a Ford F-150
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  or a Cadillac
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  or a Ferrari.
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  It varies.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  All three are different formulas.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  All three do different things.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  Turbo force is 10 hours of clean
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  out of control energy.
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  Brain force plus is a
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  long-term acting clean utropic.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:37.000]  This brain force ultra
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  is a super fast acting
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  neutropic thing.
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  Creates incredible clarity,
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  but doesn't last very long.
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  They're all three different formulas.
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  And finally,
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:49.000]  back in stock, massively discounted,

[1:29:57.000 --> 1:29:59.000]  The rage

[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  have been concentrated green
[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  powders with
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:07.000]  wheatgrass and so many other ingredients
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:09.000]  that are known to make us healthy,
[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  to make us vibrant
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  and to defend our immune systems.
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  Now, over a year and a half ago
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:17.000]  we came out with a product that was top sourced,
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  top of the line,
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  as good as it's going to get,
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  but then the supply chain broke down
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  and it was sold out for more than a year.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  Finally, green fiber capsules,
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:29.000]  this big old bottle jam packed

[1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  We're all under globalist attack.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  They don't want you to have these essential nutrients

[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  your identity from identity theft,
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:51.000]  hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.

[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  I don't feel like giving him the blessing
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  of being my dance partner in the ring.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  Especially after
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  the social media platforms
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  have made it very clear
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  how they feel about this guy, right?
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  And I would even
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  put a little call out here
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  to fellow creators
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  and even JJ.
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  You want to re-platform this guy?
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  Anyone?
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  You want to have him on your shows?
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  You want to give him another opportunity to speak
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  and spread his agenda?
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  Because whether you
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  believe it or not,
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  the shit that Andrew Tate is saying
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  will have a ripple effect
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  much more dangerous than you can imagine
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  because his narrative is truly hateful,
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  his rhetoric has
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  a negative energy and it will affect
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  impressionable young people
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  in a way that will not show
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  until years from now
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  And on the 23rd, 1910, the iconic American president who busted up the Rockefeller Trust in America gave his incredibly historic speech,
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  attendees in Paris, France.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  We have released a coin
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  that as Teddy Roosevelt on the front
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  and the gladiator on the back
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  discusses a citizen in the Republic
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  and the man in the arena.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  And info wars in everything we do
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  is about the man and the woman
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  in the arena fighting,
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  tyranny. It's the fourth coin
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  in the series we've offered
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  at PatriotCollectibles.com
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  or 1776coin.com
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  There are only 10,000
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  of this coin available.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this coin
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  is funding our operations
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  as men and women in the arena.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  Let me read to you
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  part of his famous speech.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  It's not the critic who counts,
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  not the man who points out how the strong man is stumbled
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  or where the doer of deeds
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  could have done them better.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  The credit belongs to the man
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  who is actually in the arena
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  and lives valiantly, who errs,
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  who comes short again and again
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  because there is no effort without error
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  and shortcoming, but who does actually strive
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  to do the deeds, who knows the great
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  enthusiasm, the great devotions,
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  who spends himself in a worthy cause,
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  who at best knows
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  in the end the triumph of high achievement
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  and who at worst, if he fails,
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  at least fails while daring greatly
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  so that his place shall never be
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  amongst the cold and timid souls
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  who know neither victory nor defeat.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  This is the man in the arena coin
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  only 10,000 in the world.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  Get yours now at
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  1776tocoin.com
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  and take the info or the next level.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  Are you going to get in the ring with Logan Paul?
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  Let's hope for his sake it never happens
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  because he doesn't want to get hurt that badly.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  I just find it very interesting
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  what happened to me and probably the same thing happened to you.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  During my banning
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  I saw in real time and learned
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  which public figures,
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  which talking heads, which are allowed
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  on the platform by the matrix
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  actually have any kind of degree of character
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  and which ones will instantly bend, break
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  and swap and change their opinion on you
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  overnight because somebody above them told them
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  they have to. You get to learn in real time
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  who actually sticks up for you and it's true
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  and some people are and which ones
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  just instantly cave and comply.
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  You'd be amazed how many people have absolutely
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  no moral fiber.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  How would you quantify? Because I know you have this
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  and I have it
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  like,
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  right, I don't care about being attacked
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  and when I'm in the fight politically
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  or physically or whatever it is
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  I'm in ecstasy
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  and I see these unhappy men that don't get
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  taking a chance standing up being a man
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  it's what you're supposed to do damn it
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  and so they're not even alive, they're in a coma
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  and they think like you're some weird dinosaur
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  well they should try to become that dinosaur
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  because they become nothing but jellyfish
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  can you describe what you get in the ring
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  world champion, kicked all these people's ass
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  beat all these other big champions
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  you've won like four times at least I know of
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  against top people in real
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  bare-knuckle stuff
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  what is the essence of that when you climb in the ring?
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  Yeah and that's the essence of masculinity
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  as a whole, I think it's always been about
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  competition, I think it always has been
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  it's always been about respect and respect comes from
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  winning in different various forms of competition
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  whether it's money, financial, business, physical, etc
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  and there's so many men out there today
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  that you're right, nobody respects them
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  no, they are afraid of competition
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  they've been told by the matrix they should be that way
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  they're unhappy with their lives
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  they're unhappy seeing others win
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  and then they become extremely hateful
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  and these are the exact people who pray for our downfall
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  you couldn't line up a line of people
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  and I can tell just by looking at them
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  which ones like me and support me
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  and which ones hate me
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  you can tell by their stature, you can tell by the way they talk
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  you can tell by their confidence
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  you can tell by so many different things
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  the successful people in the world are huge fans of mine
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  the successful people in the world want their children to listen to me
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  the successful people in the world realize I'm a force for good
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  the people who want to sit and pretend that I am somehow dangerous
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  are people who are sad, miserable, and lonely
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  hate never comes from above, it always comes from below
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  and these people are just desperate
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  to try and find a way to attack an alpha male
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  and the only way they can do that
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  is via these platforms run by betas
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  they can't attack us in the real world
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  perfectly said, the globalist are a bunch of
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  wimps, a bunch of nerds
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  who hate humanity, hate women, hate men
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  and see themselves really as not even human
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  and they think if they can defeat human strength
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  of family, men, women, children
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  and mount our head on the wall
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  that somehow now they're really the alpha
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  instead of becoming an alpha
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  and competing and getting in the ring
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  they want to isolate us
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  and use technology to control us
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  so they can play god
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  it's pathetic
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  I completely and utterly agree with you
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  this is the first time in human history
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  where these type of people have had any kind of influence
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  over people like us
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  before this technology bullshit
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  when they saw people like us, they bowed down
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  in respect or they ran away
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  or they complied or they followed us
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  or they were inspired by us and became something better
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  one of a few things happened
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  never in a period of human history
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  did you have a bunch of betas, dorks and geeks
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  who had the ability to shut the alphas up
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  ever and now they've got this little bit of control
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  and they think they're going to have it forever
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  and I completely and utterly disagree with that
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  I do not think god will allow the world to burn
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  the way it would burn if these people retained control
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  I think something has to happen
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  and I do believe we're at the very very beginning
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  of this movement
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  that's right and real alphas aren't evil
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  you've got twisted people you could call alphas that are evil
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  but everywhere the left is in control
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  is feces and needles and collapse
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  and ugliness and pain and crime and destruction
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  because at the end of the day they're not leading
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  they're just annihilating leadership and undermining
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  and they're even undermining their own stance
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  all these globalists are building armored redoubts
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  and fortresses running from what they've done
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  they removed male leadership from the world
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  they set up a technocracy
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  now things are collapsing
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  they feel like they're winning
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  they don't even understand chivalry
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  we didn't develop chivalry in the last few thousand years
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  as we were wimps we said hey let's just let men kill men
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  and men compete let's not wipe everything out
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  while we're doing it let's have some rules
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  and these guys have broken the rules
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  oh completely and utterly
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  you absolutely and utterly nailed it
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  and they don't even have enough self-accountability
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  or enough honor or enough responsibility
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  to look in the mirror and realize that they f***ed up
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  they're just going to run away and they're going to hire
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  some alpha male armed guards
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  big strong men to build them a bunker
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  once again more alpha males
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  they're going to exploit alpha males because they managed to get some money
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  and they're going to pay those guys and they're going to sit there and hide
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  like a bunch of f***ing cowards
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  and they don't know because I know these people
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  I know you do all
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  of the top tier people are just can't wait
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  to kill the globalist once it goes down
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  I mean they don't understand like their worst enemies
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  sitting right next to them they are so stupid
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  and that's the thing
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  I think in real time now we're starting to live in a period of history
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  after the lockdown after corona
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  now we have the problems going on in Europe
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  with Russia and Ukraine
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  we're living in a scenario now where politicians
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  in most western countries are ignoring the needs
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  of their own people to try and support this idealistic
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  view
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  or this idealistic war somewhere else
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  and this large swath of the population recently
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  in Czech Republic was huge protest
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  France was huge protest, Italy was protest
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  even in Germany they're starting to protest
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  people are starting to understand their own politicians don't care about them
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  they're selling out their own people
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  selling out their own businesses
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  selling out their own energy sector anything it takes
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  to try and support some idealistic war
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  somewhere else because they've been told to
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  by higher power and people are starting to wake up
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  saying this doesn't make sense nobody's actually representing us
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  and public consciousness
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  is what they have to fear the more people learn
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  the more people finally wake up
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  then they're going to have a serious serious problem
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  Andrew take the great reset
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  which is quantifying what you're saying
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  top 4500
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  artificially cut off the economy
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  pump credit out to people to control them bring out a social credit score
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  universal basic income
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  to dictate human behavior
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  while they're dissolving the very infrastructure
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  that protects them
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  and gives them all this science
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  and medicine and wealth
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  and then they're pretending like they're going to manage this
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  and get rid of most of us
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  and then they're going to survive with what's left
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  that is the stupidest dumbest
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  thing of you studied history
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  and it's just going to fail it's already failing
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  it's the fourth
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  coin
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  that we've released the last year
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  and I believe the most powerful
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  the man in the arena coin
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  Teddy Roosevelt
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  citizen of a republic
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  the man in the arena
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  there's only 10,000 of this coin
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  it exists in the world
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  it will never be made again
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  it's not just an amazing historic coin
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  it funds the information war
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  against the globalist
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  this is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:29.000]  this is something you want to own
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  and as a fundraiser
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  it is funding the information war
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  against the globalist
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  ladies and gentlemen
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  10,000 coins are available they'll sell out very quickly
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  please be part of history

[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  there's only 10,000 of this coin
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  in existence and it funds the info war
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:57.000]  man in the arena coin
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  Teddy Roosevelt
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  1776coin.com
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  the globalist are bombarding us with propaganda
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:05.000]  and with spiritual warfare
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  it's all come out
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  not because we're weak but because
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  we're made the image of God the creator
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  and we are powerful
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  and the social engineers fear that so much
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  so that's why I repeat
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  that famous internet saying that nobody
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  knows who first came up with the boy
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  is it true
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  the propaganda
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  would not be necessary if the situation
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  was hopeless
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  they need all their propaganda
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  and all their lies and all their evil
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  and all their cultural death
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  they know
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  we are strong and they know in the end
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  they signed on the God of this world
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  who is a loser and that's why it's so
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  important that everybody keep info wars in the air
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  now more than ever because even you don't believe
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  in God
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  what the globalist are manifesting and setting up
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  is safe handling and we are opposing
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  the one world government and the mark of the beast
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  they just announced
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:01.000]  the eugenicists over 100 years ago
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  were very public about their plans
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  they financed major universities
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  full page stories
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  and advertisements pushing their propaganda
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  of the New York Times and other major newspapers
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  that the family as we know it
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  is a bad thing and must be ended
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  and the first step in that
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  is getting women out of the household
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  and teaching women that
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  cooking dinner and taking care of their sons
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  and daughters and husbands is a bad thing
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  and I was just sitting here tonight
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  making dinner for my daughter
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  my four national daughter
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  my wife makes dinner a lot of times
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  and I make breakfast
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  and literally it's the funnest thing on earth
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  to make food family and be nurturative
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  and then all sit down together
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  and have the communal event
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  and that's what the system is attacking
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  and bombarding
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  is our normal biological actions
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  and coming together they really are
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  sick evil scientific cult
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  of filth and will domesticate us
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  and turn us into lab rats
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  we cannot let this continue

[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  than a year and a half because of supply chain breakdowns

[1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  of the new world order
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  it's Alex Jones
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  Andrew take the great reset
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  which is quantifying what you're saying
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  $14,500
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  artificially cut off the economy
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  pump credit out to people to control them
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  bring out a social credit score
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  universal basic income to dictate human behavior
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  while they're dissolving the very infrastructure
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  that protects them
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  and gives them all this science
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  and medicine and wealth
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  and then they're pretending like they're going to manage this
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  and get rid of most of us
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  and then they're going to survive with what's left
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  that is the stupidest dumbest
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  thing of you studied history
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  and you know it's already failing
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  Oh absolutely
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  but these people are completely arrogant
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  and deeply narcissistic
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  they've been born into families or societies
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  or systems where they're told for some reason
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  they're somehow god and they believe that
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  they know everything and they've never lived in the real world
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  they never interacted with real people
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  and they're just spoiled children
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  who've grown up inside of some silver spoon
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  coddled room
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  padded room bull
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  and they're f***ing fantasists
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  at a certain level of arrogance
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  you become a full-on fantasist like they are
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  it's a stupid idea and it's absolutely destined to fail
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  what's unfortunate about it is
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  it can't just fail in isolation
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  for it to fail millions of people are going to suffer and die
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  and these people are not even going to have any kind of
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  they're not even going to have any empathy
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  they're not even going to feel bad for what they did
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  because they've been born without it
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  because it's been bred out of them
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  it's absolutely not only disgusting
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  and what you said this is the essence of what we face
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  it's not just a bunch of nerds
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  and a bunch of control freaks that want to get rid of competition
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  and alpha males and show up
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  the system and what they call the final revolution
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  ending the normal
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  healthy human cycle
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  it is the aristocratic royalty and
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  inbred 20, 30 generations
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  where 300 years ago
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  if a king didn't lead an army he would get assassinated
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  they haven't led armies in over 100 years
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  they lay around
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  and they're all just
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  being pampered by sycophants
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  and they're totally delusional
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  with a technocracy
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  deploying something attacking
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  the very system that they're living off of
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  their jump of the shark
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  and it's going to fail
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  absolutely and utterly you completely nailed it
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  that's exactly what they're doing and they have this supreme arrogance
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  where they believe it's going to be okay
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  it's going to be okay for me because I have money
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  and to a degree it saved them up until this point
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  and money can save you to a point but it gets to
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  in certain places like Sri Lanka for example
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  when there's a large enough
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  uprising of the populace and people have finally had enough
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  and money didn't save them over there
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  and it gets to a certain point where people have finally had enough
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  listen, we're all human
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  and we want to have safe families and safe neighborhoods
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  we want to have consensual
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  beautiful relationships and marriages
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  we want to feel happy and feel good
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  and unfortunately under some of these laws they're making
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  and some of the societies they're trying to create
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  is literally impossible for a full-grown man
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  to have a happy consensual relationship
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  feel safe and secure in his home
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  and enjoy raising his children
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  that's becoming impossible
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  for people there's going to be massive backlash
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  amazing
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  in the 20 minutes we've got left
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  you're a great interview
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  I want to try to shut up and just let you
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  roll here for viewers and listeners
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  there's something I do with
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  guests I really want to hear from
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  for the next five minutes Andrew Tate
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  I'm going to give you the floor that I've got a bunch of questions I want to ask
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  but you've got the floor here
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  millions and millions are going to watch this obviously
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  when the two most censor men in the world
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  get together on air
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  give us your treatise
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  yeah I have a law I can talk about and a law I can say
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  but I think that it's very very important
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  that we understand if we do not
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  hang together we will hang one by one
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  and it's important
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  for people to sit here and think
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  well he got banned, maybe he was too extreme
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  this guy got banned, maybe he said
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  this one bad thing once
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  he got banned, maybe the media has a point
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  they don't have a point
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  if they had a genuine point
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  and they weren't afraid of open debate
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  and discourse then nobody would be getting banned at all
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  and they're pushing things far too
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  close to the barrier
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  and they're doing that on purpose because they fear
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  different ideas. I do believe
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  that God has a plan for the world
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  and his plan is not to allow
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  these people to completely and utterly burn it to the ground
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  I do believe that we're in a
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  period of a redemption arc for humanity
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  and things have gotten dark now
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  but a ball always hits the bottom
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  before it bounces to the top
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  it's very important the people who are awake
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  and the people who understand
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  not only trying to educate as many people as possible
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  but also support each other
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  and also support the leaders like yourself
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  and like myself who are out here
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  taking on the risk and the responsibility
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  of being completely de-platformed, de-personed
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  having serious threats on our safety
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  and security to try and tell the truth
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  it's been
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  a very interesting few years
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  and we've seen what happens when people don't have a voice
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  and don't stand up and try and repel against these systems
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  I really do think the acts
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  that have happened across these last few years
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  in the name of trying to save lives for COVID
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  have been genuinely, genuinely criminal
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  and I don't think they would have tested this kind of system
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  or tested this kind of censorship and repression
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  to just stop it and go back to normal
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  I think it was a test of a system
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  and they intend on coming in
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  harder than ever before
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  with some new story and some new excuse
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  later on down the line
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  and it gets to a point where you finally have to stand up and realize that
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  you cannot run from what is going to come to you
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  you cannot escape it
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  you cannot hide, you cannot deny it
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  you get to a point where you understand
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  you need to find people who are like-minded and stand up
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  and the best way you can stand up at this current point in time
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  is just to educate others
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  and just to highlight the injustices which are being purported
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  by these systems
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  my banning was absolutely not the unjust
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  I never broke any terms of service
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:53.000]  they know that, the whole world knows that now
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  and the public sentiment is on my side
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  and the more people talk about this
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  and the more people discuss this
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  and tell others and educate others
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  the harder it's going to be for them to keep this curtain
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  this iron curtain of theirs
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  over the truth
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  because that's all they truly want to do
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  power corrupts and absolute power corrupts
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  absolutely everyone knows this saying
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  and it's completely and utterly true
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  and we're now in a situation where they have absolute power
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  but I do believe
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  that we're moving to a transitional period
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  a transitional place
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  and you've been a massive leader in that force
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  and even now
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  even to a lot of these matrix led platforms
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  can still find videos of you
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  so they can't completely and utterly shut you up
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  because people want to listen to what you have to say
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  people want to hear you
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  and it's for that reason that they fear you
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  because they try and take men like us to lead us
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  and replace us with these talking heads
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  but humans have an instinct
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  and that instinct allows us to feel affinity with somebody
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  they can hear your voice or mine
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  and know they want to hear what we have to say
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  because they know we have character and we're integral
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  and we have morals
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  so when they put them there to read from the hymn sheet
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  it simply doesn't resonate with the youth of today
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  and that's how I managed to become the most google man on the planet
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  by just telling men the truth
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  about the experience they're going through
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  and the life they're going to live
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  it's a really interesting period of human time
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  and I've really been appreciative also of your support
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  and the support of the other mainstream characters who stood up and said listen
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  this is going on long enough
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  well it certainly has
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  the people are hungry for freedom
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  let's talk about how the enemy is going to strike back
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  because they're definitely in trouble
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  but I'm really concerned about false flags
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  ahead of the midterms
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  we already see them cutting the power off all over the world
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  they said we're going to go big
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  with environmentalism and power outages in the undercover
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  video from project Veritas
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  about eight months ago we now see that happening
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  how do you see
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  these control freaks striking back
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  well this is what's scary
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  is because power and energy
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  is the absolute base for any country on the planet
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  if you don't have energy or power you have nothing else
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  you don't have security, you don't have safety
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  you don't have food production
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  you don't have absolutely anything
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  so they're going down to the very very core
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  and very very crux of humanity now
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  once power outages start becoming a mainstream thing
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  it's not just about not being able to turn on your television
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  it's about crime
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  it's about people dying on the street
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  it's about emergency services
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  it's about food production
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  it's about so many more important things
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  and it's truly evil
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  but when you get insulated like these people are
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  at the level they're at completely insulated
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  in action they're prepared to sacrifice
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  a few pawns in their own mind
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  to try and win the chess game
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  and that's what they see us as
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  they see us as disposable and expendable
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  and yes we're living in
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  2022 we're living in a society
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  and a world which is very very technologically advanced
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  there is no reason for anywhere
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  to be running out of power
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  we've had electricity for long enough
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  and when that starts happening to believe it's some kind of
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  accident or coincidence
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  is asinine
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  it's impossible in the current world we live in
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  with all the current resource and all the smart people on the planet
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  and the fact that we all know we need electricity
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  and the fact that we had all the electricity we needed
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  in the 80's
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  to now be here 40 or 50 years later
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  and say we can't generate electricity
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  that is clown world fantasy
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  and the globalists said they were going to cut the power off
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  they cut off thousands of coal power plants here alone
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  while China builds three a week
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  they have shut us down
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  this is warfare against the west
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  because the western ideal
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  when the globalists have all these other countries under slavery
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  people will aspire
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  to western freedom
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  and so it has to be gotten rid of can you speak to that
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  oh yeah completely and early
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  and they have to change society
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  and change the basis on which society is run
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  society was run on in the west
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  on the premise of freedom you can come to the west
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  and if you comply with the law
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  we will provide you with freedom
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  they've realized that like you said
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  that doesn't give them enough control and that's what tyrants are obsessed with
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  so they want to replace freedom
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  with safety because it's the only thing
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  that people will accept their freedom being taken away for
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  we're going to take all your freedom away
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  but don't worry you're going to be safe
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  you'll be safe from the common cold
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  you'll be safe from whatever else
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  so they're trying to destroy our freedoms
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  and replace it with safety
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  now to replace freedom with safety
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  you need to convince people that they're in danger
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  how do you do that
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  well you either create a media spin
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  and convince everyone the common cold is somehow deadly
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  or what you can do
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  to increase rates
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  cause mass famine
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  and put people in danger for real
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  because when they're in real danger and they're really scared
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  then they'll really sign up for safety
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  if there's only going to be one town
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  in the whole state that has electricity
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  you're going to agree with whatever piece of paper
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  they make you sign
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  whatever rules you have to agree to
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  you're going to agree to get in
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  and that's what they're trying to do
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  and they admit that
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  club of Rome, Bilderberg group
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  build back better
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:43.000]  and you're going to have a universal basic income
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  with program tokens that tell you where and how
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  and when you can spend that money
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  I mean
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:51.000]  people ask me all the time
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  what is your best new tropic
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  you've got turbo force
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  you've got brain force plus
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:57:59.000]  and you've got brain force ultra
[1:57:59.000 --> 1:58:01.000]  which one is better
[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:03.000]  and that's like asking
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  what's better, a Ford F-150
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  or a Cadillac
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  it's different strokes for different folks
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  it varies
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  all three are different formulas
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  all three do different things
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  turbo force is 10 hours of clean
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  out of control energy
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  I can't even take a whole pack myself
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  brain force plus is a

[1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  creates incredible clarity
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  but doesn't last very long
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  three different formulas
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  and finally back at stock massively discounted

[1:59:45.000 --> 1:59:47.000]  you're really going to miss out if you don't get it
[1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:51.000]  Leading a frontal assault
[1:59:51.000 --> 1:59:53.000]  on the lies of the New World Order
[1:59:53.000 --> 1:59:55.000]  it's Alex Jones
[2:00:09.000 --> 2:00:11.000]  and I admit that
[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:13.000]  we're going to get rid of the old system
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  that's the great reset to build back better
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:17.000]  and you're going to have a universal basic income
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:19.000]  with program tokens
[2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:21.000]  that tell you where and how
[2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:23.000]  and when you can spend that money
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  I mean that is beyond the market
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:27.000]  the beast
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:29.000]  absolutely because if anybody ends the world
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:31.000]  every single system on the planet
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  is absolutely and utterly corrupt
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  the judicial system is corrupt
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  the law system is corrupt
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  the medical systems are now corrupted
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  the system that involves humanity
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:43.000]  at any level is going to have a degree of corruption
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:45.000]  and if you think they're going to give you these tokens
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  and it's going to be somehow fair and non-corrupt
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  you are an idealist at best
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  and an idiot at worst
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  probably a combination of the two
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  I often say to people
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  if you go to a poker game
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:00:59.000]  and there's no referee
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  and there's $5,000 at stake
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  do you think people would cheat
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  without any kind of referee
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  and people say well yeah probably
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  how are you going to sit and then believe
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  that the most powerful people on the planet
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  to control nations and control entire populace
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  is they're not going to cheat and bend the rules
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  of course they are this is human nature
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  absolutely what they're going to do
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  they're not going to risk losing
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  so they're going to cheat and lie and be corrupt their entire way
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  that's the only thing they're interested in
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  is absolutely not our power
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  let's talk about something that doesn't get enough attention
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  yes we know we're deep platform
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  yes we know we're demonized because we're pro-human leaders
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  yes we know the power sector is scared
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  all over twitter on the street
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  every time I go out
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  people go man I used to be a really big listener
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  are you still on air
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  only a minority of our hardcore really smart people
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  go to infowars.com
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:49.000]  or go to your website
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  or understand that they're the ones that have got to get the clips
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  and get them out on their own platforms
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:55.000]  or on the establishes platform
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  so I know people watching today are like well that's common sense
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:01:59.000]  you know I tell everybody about Tate's website
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  or Alex Jones' website
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  but this is a war
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  it wouldn't be necessary if the situation was hopeless
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  if the situation was dire
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  and it couldn't be turned around
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  and they'd already won
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  then they wouldn't need to censor us
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:15.000]  no, freedom is incredibly popular
[2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  and it's our destiny
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  and just because evil always tries to take full control of create monopolies
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  doesn't mean it's going to win
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  in fact it always destroys itself
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  so we need to get preposition as you said on the upward arc
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  I believe we're going to get into better times soon
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  we have to get preposition
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  and realize even the sociopaths out there
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  that keep going along with tyranny
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  they'd get way further ahead
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  going against the system
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  and I think that's going to be the biggest part of the tipping point we've already reached
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  not just good people saying no
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  but even people that are just mercenaries saying
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:45.000]  this is a destructive system
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  this isn't empowering me, so on those two points
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  I know you've got several websites
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  and we put them on screen
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  but it's critical that everyone say
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  we're all andritate, we're all Alex Jones
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  we're all going to promote
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  what is being attacked by the enemy
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  attacking is the antidote to the poison
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  so I'm going to ask all the viewers and listeners
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  take this interview and share it
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  go to Andrew's website, go to my site
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:09.000]  share these clips, take clips out
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  show it to your employees, show it to your boss
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  show it to your church, show it to everybody
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  because this is what the bad guys
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  don't want you to know
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  that means it's got to be magnified and amplified
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  so again the best site for people to visit
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  yeah absolutely
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  you're completely right though the enemy wants you to be lethargic, lazy
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  and perhaps even distracted
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  with their bullshit entertainment
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  they don't want you to get out there and do the real groundwork
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  of educating other people and waking them up
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  and you're right this is a war and that's the most important thing that people can do
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  I can be reached at
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  you can go there and sign up to my email list
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  it's completely and utterly free
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  where I send out a daily email on world events
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  I recommend everybody get to
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  I have some other products on there
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  I have the war room which is my private network
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:51.000]  for people who think exactly like I do
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  5000 people all around the world
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  it can be accessed through the website
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  or now the mailing list is free
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  and I look forward to speaking to people on there
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  and I keep the whole world updated with my life
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  we've got about 6-7 minutes left
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  and you've got to jump on a plane
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  and I've got to do my Thursday show
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  we're going to be airing this on the Monday show
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  and posting it to band.video
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  and so that's the coordinates of victory folks
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  don't wait for orders from headquarters
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  go to the sound of the guns as George Washington said
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  back during the Revolutionary War
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  we are going to win this thing together
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  your brother
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  you first got banned
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  where he read a bible verse on there
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:29.000]  and literally said this is full
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  mobilization everybody's got to go to rumble
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  you're also done a deal with rumble
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:35.000]  that's beautiful that's all exploding
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  when I say switch to rumble
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  let me hit you
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  with Matthew 724-7
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  everyone who hears these words of mine
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  and does them
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  will be like a wise man who built his house
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  on the rock
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:51.000]  and the rain fell and the floods came
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  down on that house
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:55.000]  but it did not fall
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:04:57.000]  because it had been founded on the rock
[2:04:57.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  the rage
[2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:01.000]  for more than a decade
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:03.000]  have been concentrated
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  green powders
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:07.000]  with wheatgrass
[2:05:07.000 --> 2:05:09.000]  and so many other ingredients that are known
[2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:11.000]  to make us healthy
[2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:13.000]  to make us vibrant
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:15.000]  and to defend our immune systems
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:17.000]  now over a year and a half ago

[2:05:19.000 --> 2:05:21.000]  as good as it's going to get
[2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:23.000]  but then the supply chain broke down
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  and it was sold out for more than a year
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:27.000]  finally green fiber capsules

[2:05:59.000 --> 2:06:01.000]  at infowarstore.com
[2:06:01.000 --> 2:06:19.000]  everyone says that today the royal family
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:21.000]  is nothing more than a ceremonial figure
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:23.000]  even though they choose the government
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  have final approval over all legislation
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:29.000]  and own half the country
[2:06:29.000 --> 2:06:31.000]  and so while we remember Queen Elizabeth
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:33.000]  let us not forget
[2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  how this incestuous family
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:37.000]  has used their own children
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:39.000]  to gain power
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  parliamentary law fair
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  over trading rights between England
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:45.000]  and Scotland
[2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:47.000]  led to the first iteration of the United Kingdom
[2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:49.000]  in 1707
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:51.000]  and created the legal groundwork
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:53.000]  for George of Hanover
[2:06:53.000 --> 2:06:55.000]  to be crowned King of England
[2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:57.000]  in Ireland in 1714
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  he was 55 years old
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  married to his first cousin
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:03.000]  and didn't speak any English
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:07.000]  because he was from the German house of Hanover
[2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:09.000]  the English people were not happy about this
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:11.000]  and his coronation was met
[2:07:11.000 --> 2:07:13.000]  with riots all across the country
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  followed by years of rebellions
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:17.000]  his grandson
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  King George III
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:21.000]  inspired the American Revolution
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:23.000]  and when his granddaughter Victoria
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  married her first cousin Prince Albert
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:27.000]  the house of Saxe, Coburg and Gotha
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:29.000]  took sway over the country
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:31.000]  throughout the first world war
[2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  the people of England
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:35.000]  were questioning the loyalty
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  of the German bloodlines
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  who ruled over them
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  which prompted the royal family
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  to change their name to Windsor
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:45.000]  in 1917
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  nine years later Queen Elizabeth was born
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:49.000]  who was initiated
[2:07:49.000 --> 2:07:51.000]  into the druid order in 1946
[2:07:51.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  married Prince Philip
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:55.000]  of Nazi bloodlines
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  in 1947
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:07:59.000]  and gave birth to Charles
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  in 1948
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:03.000]  in 2010
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:05.000]  William Coombs, survivor of Canada's
[2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  infamous residential schools
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  where the mass graves of children were found
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  claimed to have witnessed
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:13.000]  Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip
[2:08:13.000 --> 2:08:15.000]  visit the Cam Loops
[2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:17.000]  there's why I published my book
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  with Tony Lyons
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  he joins us to talk about this
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:23.000]  we can also put the book on the screen
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:27.000]  I had a copy here with me but somebody took it off my desk
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  the great reset in the war for the world
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  I've talked to friends and family
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  in Dallas
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  and Austin
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  who went into bookstores
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  and
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:43.000]  in one case there was five books
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  by the time she left
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  there was one book left she bought one
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  that's while she was there
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  and it was a similar story out of Dallas
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  so thanks for everybody getting this book
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:55.000]  it's a political statement to have it
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:08:57.000]  it's the blueprints of the new world order they don't want it read
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  and imagine if this was to number one
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  which we know it really did
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  imagine how big that would be
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  for a cultural statement
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:07.000]  but just like they'll steal an election
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  ladies and gentlemen
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  they will engage in this type of behavior
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  but we just get punch-drunk to it
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  Tony don't we
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  we just get punch-drunk to them engaging
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:19.000]  in this type of behavior
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  what would you call it as the publisher
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  of the great reset in the war for the world
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  what would you call this type of activity
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  and unlike corporate media
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  we're going to show people the other
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  bestseller list
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  we're on multiple top lists we're number two
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  and a bunch of others we're on the top five
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  top ten
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  and then doesn't even make the so-called
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  vaunted New York Times bestseller list
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  that is a total
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  red-handed
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  what does this really mean
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  yeah you know it's exactly
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  what's covered in your book
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  I mean this kind of thing is the great reset
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  in that
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  they want to control
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  what you do what you think
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  and what you read
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  and they use their bestseller list
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  as a way to convince people
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  that something is worth reading
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  so it's a recommended reading list
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  so this book sold more
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  than any other hard-cover
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:15.000]  non-fiction book in America
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:17.000]  last week and it was nowhere
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  on the New York Times bestseller list
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  so there was a book on that list
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  that sold 3,500 copies
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  your book Alex
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  sold nine times as many copies
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  as that book and didn't make it
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  on their list I mean it's absolute
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  fraud and they are
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:35.000]  telling you I mean they are falsely
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  claiming that this book isn't selling
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:39.000]  well and it's the
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  best-selling book in America this week
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  so it's insane
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:45.000]  and we need to really fight against it
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  that the best-selling book in America
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  doesn't make that list
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  you can't read about it in any mainstream
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  newspaper it's a total media
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:55.000]  silence media blackout
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:57.000]  and you know your viewers
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  have to recognize what's happening here
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  that you've written an important
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  book and the subject matter
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  of the book is exactly
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  what's happening to the book
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  that they're trying to exercise total control
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  and what all the big tech
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:13.000]  platforms do with this kind of
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  book is they don't allow you to
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:17.000]  advertise for it they take
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  likes off they put this kind of
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  friction on it so that it makes it
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  really hard for people to find
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  it so they play around with the
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  algorithms so these
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  companies are trying to control
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  what you see what you do
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:33.000]  what you think everything
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  and that's what this book
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:37.000]  is about and that's why this book
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:39.000]  is so important
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  Tony Tony you just said it way better
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:43.000]  than I can say it I mean to quantify
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  this it's number one in non-fiction
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  number two book in the world according
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  to Wall Street Journal and we're in a bunch
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  of other major lists the New York Times
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  says no yeah we know
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  we claim something's the best-seller
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  people believe the knowledge of the crowd
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  but we're gonna lie to you until you other stuff
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  is I mean this really is
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  fraud it's it's absolutely
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:05.000]  insane it shows we'd win the culture
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  war overnight if they would just
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  stop the censorship it's a very
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  ballsy move
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  I mean this is just insane
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  censorship and they know
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  what they're doing and I
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  called them up and I asked them
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  what's the story here
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  you can look at NPD book scan
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  and you see this this monster
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  number how is it that
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  you don't put it on the best-seller
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:31.000]  list and they said well
[2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  the sales didn't meet
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  our standards so I said what do
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  you mean by that and they said
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  the sales didn't meet our standards so
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:41.000]  I said please clarify that
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  they then came back and said
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  it's just about sale so I said
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  is this about
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  the fact that it's Alex Jones
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  is it about the fact
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  that it's a subject matter that you disagree
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:55.000]  with and they said absolutely
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  not it's just sales so
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  they're so used to lying
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  to the American public that they have
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:03.000]  no qualms about saying something
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  that's so blatantly untrue
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  there's no way that this is
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  about anything other than
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  the subject matter they don't want
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  you to read this book they don't want
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:15.000]  you to think about this book they don't
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  want you to believe that this is the
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  best-selling book in America and it is
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:21.000]  that's just amazing
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  and what I've
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  anecdotally heard from friends and family about
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:27.000]  it you know the book being
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  at the front of the store but selling out quickly
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  you were telling me on the phone the other day
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  that you're seeing massive orders
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  at the bookstore level so that's got to
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  really freak out the establishment
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  sure I mean
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:41.000]  they will do everything
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  to make it less likely that
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  people buy this book you know like I said
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  they're going to be libraries that don't
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  carry it you know small
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  privately owned bookstores all across
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  the country are boycotting the book
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  they're not
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  going to let us advertise for it like I said
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  before so all of these different kind
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  of friction so they're in the book business
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  but they're really in the
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  1984 business
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  of banning books
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  sure you know they
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  they specifically say
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  that they won't carry books now
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  that they disagree with so there are
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  hundreds of bookstores in this country
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:19.000]  that will not take even a special
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  order so if you call up a bookstore
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  and say I want
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  10 copies of Alex Jones's The Great
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  Reset they will say
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  we don't carry that book we don't want the order
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  and these are struggling bookstores
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  so they feel so
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:35.000]  sort of empowered and so
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  convinced that
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  censorship is the
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  right way to run a business
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  and you know that the truth
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  is that if you
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:47.000]  have a better argument you don't need
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  censorship if they could address
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  the claims in this book
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  and disprove them they would do that
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  right I mean
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:57.000]  why do they need to try to prevent
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  people from reading the book by playing
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:01.000]  all these games if they
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  have a real argument if they could have
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  a debate with you over these things
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  that are happening in this country
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  but they don't want debate they don't believe in
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  debate because they're fascists
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  and they're trying to force you
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:15.000]  to do what they want you to do
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  and to think what they want you to think
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  well that's right I mean talk about we're gonna go to break
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  but the Streisand effect the arrogance
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  of doing this and I guess they think it's gonna work
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  but it looks like so far it hasn't
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  thanks to all the great listeners
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  and viewers that have gotten the book
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:31.000]  and so this is a real political war here
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  to continue to hammer this out we come back

[2:20:03.000 --> 2:20:19.000]  it's Alex Jones
[2:20:19.000 --> 2:20:21.000]  Tony Lyons, owner and publisher

[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:27.000]  he was telling me during the break
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:29.000]  he's never seen anything like it
[2:20:29.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  the New York Times will push titles down
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:33.000]  next number one
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  they've never taken it out of the bestseller list
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:37.000]  this is fraud next level
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  they claim they're showing you bestselling books
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  they're lying to you and you're not
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:43.000]  the other big charts show number two

[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:51.000]  yeah so in
[2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:53.000]  25 years of publishing books
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:55.000]  I've published 59
[2:20:55.000 --> 2:20:57.000]  New York Times bestsellers
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:20:59.000]  I've seen the New York Times play all kinds of games
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  I've seen them take books that should have been
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:03.000]  number one and make it number five
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:05.000]  make it number seven
[2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  but I've never seen them do this
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  where a book outsold any other
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  book in the country in its category
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:13.000]  and they did not put it on
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  anywhere and then they claim that it was
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:17.000]  about sales I mean that is an
[2:21:17.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  absolute fraud on the American
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  public and
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  if you look at some of the blurbs that we got
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:25.000]  for this book you know I want to
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:27.000]  just read a couple of things that people said
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:29.000]  so Tucker Carlson said
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  if Alex Jones is just a crackpot
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  why are the most powerful people
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:35.000]  in the country trying to silence him
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:37.000]  so you see that here that the
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  New York Times is trying to silence him
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:41.000]  that you know
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:43.000]  every major newspaper
[2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  is trying to silence him that the
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  government doesn't want you to read this book
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  and why is that it's because they're afraid
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:51.000]  of the message in this book
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  Steven Bannon says
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:55.000]  that people should read the book
[2:21:55.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  and decide for yourself
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:21:59.000]  you know that's you know
[2:21:59.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  what people need to do
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  what they need to have the right to do
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:05.000]  in a democracy is get
[2:22:05.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  real information
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  and you know what's happened over the last
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  two years is that we've been told
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:13.000]  that the government or that big tech companies
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:15.000]  want to protect us from
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  misinformation but what it's really
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  come down to is that
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  they just want to tell their narrative
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  and they want to get rid of every
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:25.000]  other narrative and that's what
[2:22:25.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  Alex Jones is talking about in this
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:29.000]  book that we have to protect freedom
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:31.000]  and there are a bunch of things that
[2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:33.000]  you can do to help get this
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:35.000]  message out so I would like
[2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:37.000]  people to go on to Facebook
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:39.000]  to go on to YouTube to go on
[2:22:39.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  to Instagram and say
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  that the New York Times
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  is committing the worst
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:47.000]  kind of fraud on the American
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:49.000]  public that they took the number one
[2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  best-selling book and they didn't list
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:53.000]  it anywhere and that
[2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:55.000]  has to be called out and people
[2:22:55.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  have to be alerted
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:22:59.000]  to the kinds of things that are happening
[2:22:59.000 --> 2:23:01.000]  that all the big tech platforms now
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  have been enlisted by the government
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:05.000]  to shut out
[2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  any kind of dissent
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:09.000]  that they're trying to prevent what they
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  call confusion
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  and they're using what they call friction
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:15.000]  which is de-emphasizing
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  books, delisting books
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  making it harder for people to find
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  things and one of the ways that they
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  do that is by keeping it off
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:25.000]  best-seller lists.
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:27.000]  A very bold move
[2:23:27.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  they're afraid of this because it's a
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  countervailing narrative to their
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  globalist narrative. They don't want a debate
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  to be about a bunch of multinational
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  corporations announcing me into freedom.
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  Right,
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  but what's really so
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:43.000]  shocking there is that exactly the same
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  kinds of things that you're describing
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  in this book are being used
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:49.000]  against this book
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  and they are trying
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  kind of tooth and nail doing everything
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:55.000]  they can do to get
[2:23:55.000 --> 2:23:57.000]  viewers
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  and readers not to read the book
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  and I think you're going to see that more
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  and more in the coming days. This is
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  a playbook that they've described
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  in pamphlets that they put out
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:09.000]  where they say that they're going to
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  partner with all kinds
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:13.000]  of places that the government's going to
[2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:15.000]  partner with big tech companies
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  to make sure that the general public
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:19.000]  doesn't get any misinformation
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:21.000]  and any time you hear that
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  word now from the government
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:25.000]  it should be a red flag
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:27.000]  that this book is not
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  misinformation. This is a narrative
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:31.000]  that they don't like
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  and if they have a good argument against
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  the thoughts in this book
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  they should come out and make those
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:39.000]  arguments. They should disprove
[2:24:39.000 --> 2:24:41.000]  what Alex Jones says, not
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  censor him. It's un-American
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  it's unconstitutional
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  and it has to stop.
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  And we're unlike corporate media
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  that will actually show you the real list.
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  I've got the Wall Street Journal, I've got a bunch of others here.
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  Number two, Wall Street Journal, number two
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:57.000]  publishes weekly. Number ten, USA Today
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  which includes all categories including
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  textbooks, not even shown
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  on the New York Times bestseller list.
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  Total fraud. Here's the actual numbers
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:07.000]  tell us about this.
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  Yeah, so
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  the Wall Street Journal made it
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  the number two book
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  and the claim that I saw
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:17.000]  there was that they were
[2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  about 6,000 copies
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  sold that didn't actually get
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  shipped because the book was selling
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  so quickly in a four or
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  five day period. So something
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:29.000]  like 36,000 were ordered
[2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  but only 30,000 shipped.
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  So maybe the Wall Street Journal wasn't
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  playing games there, that's kind of hard
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  to tell. But the New York Times
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  clearly this is a game
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:41.000]  this is fraud and they're
[2:25:41.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  really struggling to
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  tell their readers one narrative
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  and to make sure
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  that you don't get any other narrative
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:51.000]  that you don't know the truth, you don't
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:25:53.000]  know what's selling, you don't know what people
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  believe, you don't know what people are interested
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  in and if they can do that
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  with a book they can do it about anything.
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  So you have to look at
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  any story that a place like
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  the New York Times publishes
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  and wonder whether that itself
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  is real misinformation
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  where they're just telling a story
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  because they want you to
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  believe that story, not because
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:17.000]  it's factual, not because it's based on
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:19.000]  research and not because it's based
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  on, in this case, the number
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  of copies sold.
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:25.000]  Well Tony, I want to commend you
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  and thank you for your courage and
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  the fact that I've been interviewing you
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  for many years at
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:33.000]  infoworksport.com we've sold hundreds of titles
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  like Robert F. Kennedy's book that came out that was huge
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:37.000]  and you said, hey, let's do this
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:39.000]  and so I said, okay, I'll do it
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:41.000]  and your courage doing this because obviously
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  you're going to get targeted, you're going to be attacked
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  for what you've done but
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:47.000]  regardless of your political
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:49.000]  bent, this is
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  just pro-freedom to do this
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  and so I'm just blessed that you've been here,
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  you've been involved in this
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  but I guess in closing
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  did you even expect the censorship to be
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:01.000]  this intense?
[2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:03.000]  I did not think
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:05.000]  in my wildest dreams that they would
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:07.000]  totally keep it off the best seller list.
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  I mean, I've seen a lot
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  of
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:13.000]  stories coming out of the New York
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:15.000]  Times that I believe are just
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  untrue and I've seen
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:19.000]  all kinds of games on big
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  tech platforms to make it less likely
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  that you can buy something
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:25.000]  but they are going, they are
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  getting to the depths
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:29.000]  of corruption and of
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  censorship and
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  so this is something that I'm going to fight against
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  for the rest of my life.
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:37.000]  People have asked me whether I'm
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  afraid of standing up
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  to these powerful forces that want to control
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  what people think and read
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:45.000]  and my position is
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:47.000]  I would be afraid not to.
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:49.000]  I would be afraid to live in a world
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:51.000]  where I couldn't
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  and wasn't willing to fight against
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  these kinds of things and I'm glad
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  to be partnering with you on this book
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  because I've seen that you are fighting
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  against these same kinds of forces.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:03.000]  We got 50 seconds left
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  as
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:07.000]  negative as this is and as sad as it is
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  they are showing themselves. We forced
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  them out in the open and so I think
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  in the end we are going to win because now
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  they are acting like complete and total tyrants.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  Yeah, because this is
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  so blatant that
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  people ought to realize it
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:23.000]  and that's what's happened during
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  this whole two year period now
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  that there's been so much censorship
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  so much
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  deplatforming of sort of doctors
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  and scientists and writers
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  and anybody who disagrees
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  with a very specific narrative
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  and so what's happened is you went
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  from sort of a counterculture
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  of people who
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  didn't believe the New York Times
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  narrative or the
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  US government narrative on certain
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  subject matter. Tony, Tony, don't hang up.
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  I got Alex Dine popping in briefly from Tucker Carlson.
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:55.000]  I'm going to come back to you. Do one more segment.
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  The rage
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:28:59.000]  for more than a decade
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  have been concentrated
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:03.000]  green powders
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:05.000]  with wheatgrass and so
[2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:07.000]  many other ingredients that are known
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:09.000]  to make us healthy, to make us
[2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:11.000]  vibrant and to defend
[2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:13.000]  our immune systems. Now over
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  a year and a half ago we came out with a product
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:17.000]  that was top sourced, top of the line
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:19.000]  as good as it's going to get
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:21.000]  but then the supply chain broke down
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  and it was sold out for more than a year. Finally
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:25.000]  green fiber capsules
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  this big old bottle jam packed
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:29.000]  is back in stock
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  for a limited time at infowarstore.com

[2:29:47.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  We're all under globalist attack
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:51.000]  they don't want you to have these essential nutrients
[2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  that are in this product. Get yours today

[2:30:45.000 --> 2:30:47.000]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com
[2:30:47.000 --> 2:30:49.000]  and that's how we fund this operation
[2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:57.000]  and if you don't fund us and don't want to share that's fine.
[2:30:57.000 --> 2:30:59.000]  It's the fourth coin
[2:30:59.000 --> 2:31:01.000]  that we've released the last year
[2:31:01.000 --> 2:31:03.000]  and I believe the most powerful
[2:31:03.000 --> 2:31:05.000]  the man in the arena coin
[2:31:05.000 --> 2:31:07.000]  Teddy Roosevelt
[2:31:07.000 --> 2:31:09.000]  citizen of a republic
[2:31:09.000 --> 2:31:11.000]  the man in the arena
[2:31:11.000 --> 2:31:13.000]  there's only 10,000 of this coin
[2:31:13.000 --> 2:31:15.000]  and it exists in the world
[2:31:15.000 --> 2:31:17.000]  it will never be made again
[2:31:17.000 --> 2:31:19.000]  and it's not just an amazing historic coin
[2:31:19.000 --> 2:31:21.000]  it funds the information war
[2:31:21.000 --> 2:31:23.000]  against the globalist
[2:31:23.000 --> 2:31:25.000]  this is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren
[2:31:25.000 --> 2:31:27.000]  this is something you want to own
[2:31:27.000 --> 2:31:29.000]  and as a fundraiser
[2:31:29.000 --> 2:31:31.000]  it is funding the information war
[2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:33.000]  against the globalist
[2:31:33.000 --> 2:31:35.000]  ladies and gentlemen
[2:31:35.000 --> 2:31:37.000]  10,000 coins are available
[2:31:37.000 --> 2:31:39.000]  they'll sell out very quickly
[2:31:39.000 --> 2:31:41.000]  please be part of history
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:43.000]  and thank you all for your support

[2:31:53.000 --> 2:31:55.000]  man in the arena coin
[2:31:55.000 --> 2:31:57.000]  Teddy Roosevelt
[2:31:57.000 --> 2:31:59.000]  1776coin.com
[2:31:59.000 --> 2:32:01.000]  if you're like myself and so many other people on this planet
[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:03.000]  especially as you get older
[2:32:03.000 --> 2:32:05.000]  you gain weight even if you eat a lot less
[2:32:05.000 --> 2:32:07.000]  I gotta tell you
[2:32:07.000 --> 2:32:09.000]  info wars is only about bringing you amazing products
[2:32:09.000 --> 2:32:11.000]  that really work
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:13.000]  so we looked at the supplement market
[2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:15.000]  what are the best selling
[2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:17.000]  natural healthy anti-fat weight loss
[2:32:17.000 --> 2:32:19.000]  products that are out there
[2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:21.000]  we went and looked at the top 10
[2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:23.000]  they all had the same ingredients
[2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:25.000]  in common that is in this product
[2:32:25.000 --> 2:32:27.000]  but with our new product from X7
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:29.000]  diet force
[2:32:29.000 --> 2:32:31.000]  we got the very best concentrates
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:33.000]  of these known
[2:32:33.000 --> 2:32:35.000]  natural essences
[2:32:35.000 --> 2:32:37.000]  that's just two amazing things for your body
[2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:39.000]  and so I've lost almost 40 pounds
[2:32:39.000 --> 2:32:41.000]  I'm so a little bit of a weight
[2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:43.000]  in the last three months and I've been doing it
[2:32:43.000 --> 2:32:45.000]  using diet force and also exercise

[2:33:15.000 --> 2:33:25.000]  it really works
[2:33:25.000 --> 2:33:35.000]  it really works
[2:33:35.000 --> 2:33:45.000]  does anybody else see a problem here
[2:33:45.000 --> 2:33:47.000]  alright here's the bottom line
[2:33:47.000 --> 2:33:49.000]  this isn't even about bringing in money
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:51.000]  it does some of that
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  it's about culturally having the number one
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  book and the people exposing
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:57.000]  Klaus Schwab and the great research
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  of the new world order
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  and the death star plan of their operation
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:03.000]  and that's why it was the number one
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  bug and that's why the New York Times
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  censored it when they're supposedly
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  the most prestigious group that tells you
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  what America's reading and what the people
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  think that's a fraud
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:15.000]  on their readers
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  on their supporters
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  but we're not going to give up
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:21.000]  this is already a huge victory
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:23.000]  against their tyranny
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  the great reset
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:27.000]  and the war for the world
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  and there are a lot of important places to get it
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  but wherever you get it call your book stores
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  out, ask for more
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:35.000]  do your Christmas shopping
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  don't battle the crowds, don't wait
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:39.000]  months and drive around in all the traffic
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:41.000]  just order 5, 6, 7 copies
[2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  of the book right now at Amazon.com
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:45.000]  or M4store.com
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  or Skyhorse or Barnes & Noble
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  and know that it's a revolutionary act
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  to share this book
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:53.000]  that the enemies of free speech
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:34:55.000]  are scared of it
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:34:57.000]  piss in the face
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:34:59.000]  of the New York Times
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:01.000]  let them know you're aware of what they've done
[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  because believe me, they're scared of the fact
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:05.000]  that I have the number one Joe Rogan podcast
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  three of them
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:09.000]  they're scared of the fact that freedom is so popular
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:11.000]  and they don't want to recognize
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:13.000]  that you recognize the truth
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:15.000]  and justice and freedom
[2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:17.000]  plus the information in this book
[2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:19.000]  is insane
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:21.000]  it's their own words
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  it's their own admissions, it's like Hitler wrote Mein Kampf
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:25.000]  saying what he would do but people ignored it
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  we're showing you in their own words
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  what they would do and they're doing it
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  this is like their Mein Kampf
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  but I wrote it for them to bring them down
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:35.000]  so Tony Lyons in closing
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  how do people beat the censorship
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  how do they defeat it
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  the system scared of this weapon
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  everybody should use this book as a rallying point right now
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  because that's what it is
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  definitely, I mean buying this book
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:49.000]  is an act of rebellion
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:51.000]  against the things that are described in this book
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  and they are using
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:55.000]  the methods that are described
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:35:57.000]  in this book against the book itself
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:35:59.000]  so like I said
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:01.000]  if you have a better argument
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:03.000]  and I mean the New York Times
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  if the New York Times has a better argument
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:07.000]  they don't need to censor the book
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:09.000]  they're afraid of the book
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:11.000]  they can't answer the allegations
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:13.000]  they must know that they're true
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  but for the New York Times
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:17.000]  which is a news organization
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  to do everything they can
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:21.000]  to lie to the American people
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  about the sales of a book in its first week
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  you know that's
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  what have we come to
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  as a country
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:31.000]  and like you were saying
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:33.000]  there are periodicals that come out
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:35.000]  this is one that
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:37.000]  says that they're going to do all these kinds of things
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:39.000]  this is from the US Surgeon General
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:41.000]  and it basically says
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  that they're going to have these kind of public
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  and private partnerships
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  the kinds of things described in this book
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:49.000]  to stifle dissent
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:51.000]  to make sure that you
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:53.000]  can't get other ideas
[2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:55.000]  other narratives
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:36:57.000]  so this is an important book
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:36:59.000]  I would like you guys to go on to social media
[2:36:59.000 --> 2:37:01.000]  to tell the world what's going on here
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:03.000]  this was the best selling book in America
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:05.000]  and the New York Times
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  is not listing it, not reviewing it
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  not saying a word about it
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  and you know Alex Jones
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  has an important message
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  that people have to read
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:17.000]  and I would like to read Joe Rogan's blurb
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:19.000]  about Alex Jones
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:21.000]  is right about far more
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:23.000]  than he's wrong about
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  he's the most misunderstood guy on the planet
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  so all the people who think
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  that they disagree with you Alex
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:31.000]  they have to read this book
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:33.000]  that's what happens in a democracy
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  if you're going to say you disagree with a book
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:37.000]  you have to read it, you have to think about it
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  and then make a better argument
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:41.000]  and everybody else
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:43.000]  all of you people who have already bought copies
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  and who know what Alex Jones stands for
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  and what he said in this book
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  like I said, go on social media
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:51.000]  tell the world what's going on here
[2:37:51.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  and expose all of these
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:37:55.000]  more importantly than just buying another copy
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  to give us a gift and that's important
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:37:59.000]  is to now tell people why you got the book
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:01.000]  and do a review on YouTube, Twitter
[2:38:01.000 --> 2:38:03.000]  Facebook, Instagram
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:05.000]  and exercise your free speech and say
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:07.000]  I read the book, here's what I think
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:09.000]  and I'm trying to think of a headline for this show
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  that we're live right now about the rear part of it tomorrow
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  after the Andrew Taylor review we're going to premiere
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  but I mean it's breaking
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:18.000]  New York Times caught in massive censorship scandal
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  suppresses number one book in the world
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:22.000]  for political views
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  I mean this is a big deal
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:25.000]  and they're trying to just normalize
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  they can do stuff like this, no
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  it's not normal and that's what tyrants do
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:31.000]  Hitler did it, Stalin did it
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  Mao did it, Velikastro did it
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  Hugo Chavez did it
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  they try to just normalize this type of crap
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:39.000]  this is outrageous
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  people have to know that when they go
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  on the internet now
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  they can see things that aren't true
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  when they read the New York Times
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:49.000]  they can read things that just blatantly aren't true
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  you can have a book
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:53.000]  that
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  doesn't have any likes for example
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  because
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  the specific platform
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  doesn't like that book
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:03.000]  so they take the likes down
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  so we've seen that in book after book
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:07.000]  but this book so far it's got more than
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  500 reviews
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  and they're almost all
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:13.000]  5 stars
[2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  so the people are speaking
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  the people who are actually reading the book
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:19.000]  that's important too on Amazon
[2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:21.000]  like a 99% positive rating
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:23.000]  I mean this thing is getting 5 stars everywhere
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  yeah
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  so we have to watch it closely
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:29.000]  to make sure that they don't start taking down
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  any of those
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:33.000]  because that's what they've done in the past
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:35.000]  and we have to hold their feet to the fire
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:37.000]  hold the mainstream media's feet
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:39.000]  to the fire
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:41.000]  and the stories that people really care about
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  and they have to write about the books
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:45.000]  and like I said even if they disagree
[2:39:45.000 --> 2:39:47.000]  they have to make an argument
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:49.000]  of why they disagree
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:51.000]  well that's right Tony something we saw
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  starting about 10 years ago but now it's almost everywhere
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:55.000]  all these big newspapers almost all of them got rid of comments
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:39:57.000]  now YouTube
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  a pro Alex Jones quote
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  or a pro Robert F. Kennedy jr. quote
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:03.000]  somebody may have
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  10,000 likes
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  it's way down the bottom something with 5
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:09.000]  dislikes is the top thing
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  YouTube even admits they put
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  negative stuff up on top
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:15.000]  so this is at every level they're trying to stop
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  the average person from having their voice heard
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  and this book is a major rallying point
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:21.000]  in that fight
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  that's a great point that you brought up
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:25.000]  because with Robert F. Kennedy jr.
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:27.000]  book The Real Anthony Fauci
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:29.000]  the number one
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  review was written by Dr.
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  Mercola and it had something like
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:35.000]  7,500 likes
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  and that was just taken down
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  so now the top positive review
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  has only 59 likes
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  and the top negative one
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  has 2,500
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  I mean I see it all the time they'll have some article that I have
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  child porn it's totally not true
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  and then they'll have some dude with 500
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:53.000]  likes at the top and somebody with 20,000
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:55.000]  views cut out I mean this is
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:40:57.000]  organized brigades of fraud going on
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  as the establishment tries to suppress
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  human will
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  this is
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  history of truth this is
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  1984 happening before
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:09.000]  our eyes and that's what
[2:41:09.000 --> 2:41:11.000]  this book is about that's what the great
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  reset is about it's about
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  all of these incredible
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  processes that have been instituted
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  in this country to take away
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:21.000]  your freedom and how they're trying to make it permanent
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  so in closing it's critical
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  everybody folks why battle
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  the lines and the traffic
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  and all of it seriously this is a serious war
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:31.000]  I just want to stay on air and beat these people
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:33.000]  go
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:35.000]  get 5, 10 copies in your
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  Christmas shopping now where is the best place
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  for people to go buy the book where it sells
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  so many copies because we're just counting the
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  weeks as it came out and even way more sells
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  in pre-order and they're ignoring
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  those but you're almost
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  saying more important than regular
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  listeners buying more copies is just do a
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:53.000]  review
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  right definitely go on to
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:57.000]  Amazon go on to barnesandnoble.com
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:41:59.000]  go on to target.com
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  and write a
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:03.000]  review and make sure that it stays there
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  and then also write about
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:07.000]  like I said the New York Times
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  write about these things that are going on
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  and if you see them playing games write
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  about that if you see if you
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  put a review up and it gets taken
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  down write about that put it on
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  Instagram put it on Facebook
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  they're scared of this book being a rallying point
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  which it already is so let's make it a battle
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:25.000]  point to get all the sheeple to go
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  read it and find out just like Alexander
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  Schultz and Easton's Gulagher Pelago
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:31.000]  this is a very important book Tony
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  Lyons thank you for being a visionary
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  thanks for getting me to write the book
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  and God bless you sir
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  thanks so much
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  wow that was powerful I got one more
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  segment I'm going to do with some other news
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  I want to hit we're going to come back and cover it
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  but man
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:49.000]  the New York Times has never done this
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  before they are so scared
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:53.000]  what is it in the great reset in the war for
[2:42:53.000 --> 2:42:57.000]  they don't want you to see
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:42:59.000]  people ask me all the time
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:01.000]  what is your best new tropic
[2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:03.000]  you've got turbo force
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:05.000]  you've got brain force plus
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:07.000]  and you've got brain force ultra
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  which one is better
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:11.000]  and that's like asking
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:13.000]  what's better a Ford F-150
[2:43:13.000 --> 2:43:15.000]  or a Cadillac
[2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:17.000]  or a Ferrari
[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:19.000]  it's different strokes for different folks
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:21.000]  it varies all three are different formulas
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:23.000]  all three do different things
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:25.000]  turbo force is 10 hours of
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  clean out of control energy
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  I can't even take a whole pack myself
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  brain force plus
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:33.000]  is a long term acting
[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  clean new tropic
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:37.000]  this brain force ultra
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:39.000]  is a super fast acting
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:41.000]  new tropic that
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:43.000]  creates incredible clarity but doesn't last very long
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:45.000]  they're all three different formulas
[2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:47.000]  and finally back in stock

[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:28.000]  and all the things out there hurting everybody

[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:40.000]  in the last few years
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:42.000]  the only way you fail is not
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:44.000]  writing down the URL
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:46.000]  jonestaxrelief.com
[2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:48.000]  one word jonestaxrelief.com
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:53.000]  833-904-285
[2:45:53.000 --> 2:45:56.000]  833-904-285
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  everybody knows that

[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:08.000]  but what I don't see being
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  promoted is the fact that it has
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  natural
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:14.000]  psychotropic effects
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  it certainly does for me
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  I've done a couple of these capsules
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  an hour before bed
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  my sleep my dreams are amazing
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  now there are actually some studies out there
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:26.000]  linking it to amazing
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  events in the brain

[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:54.000]  thank you all for your support
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  we're going to miss out if you don't get it
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:30.000]  that's coming up here in just a few minutes with your calls
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  and a bunch of other news
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  alright
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  I meant to play this Friday
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:38.000]  I didn't get to it I want to play it now
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:40.000]  Alec Stein
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:42.000]  a lot of people were thinking oh this guy is just a troll
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:44.000]  oh this guy
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:46.000]  you know what's he doing
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  he's very smart
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:50.000]  they killed his mother with the covid hospital garbage
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:52.000]  and I told you watch this guy carefully
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  because he's the type of people that the bad guys
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:56.000]  are getting off the bench with their activity
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:47:58.000]  so he went out and trolled to get a
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:00.000]  massive following
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:02.000]  and now he's showing you the intellectual he is
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  and when I'm in Connecticut with the next show trial
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:08.000]  not this week but next week
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:10.000]  he'll be hosting one of the shows here
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:12.000]  and he'll show you the real Alec Stein
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  that's why in his first phase
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:16.000]  when he was here months ago
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:18.000]  I said stop it and show me who you really are
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  because I knew
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  later he goes not yet
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  but now he is showing them
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:26.000]  and he's a very smart guy
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  and that's what I've been waiting for
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:30.000]  is other men and women
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:32.000]  that have the power to take down the new world order
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:34.000]  I'm waiting for you
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  and I'm starting to see it so it's very very exciting
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:38.000]  we're going to win this folks
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  we already are winning intellectually
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  but it's going to get a lot rougher before
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:44.000]  we turn the tide
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  that's why history works but here he was last week
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:48.000]  on Tucker Carlson laying out
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  control the trauma based mind control
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  and then you know we have to get conspiratorial
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  and we look at the Iran Contra
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:48:58.000]  the CIA was trading drugs with
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  Nicaraguans for guns
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:02.000]  we were giving them guns and then they were taking that cocaine
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  and they were flying it into Mina Arkansas
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  which Bill Clinton happened to be the governor of that state
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  and they were taking those drugs and they were putting them in Florida
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  they were putting in California, Freeway, Ricky Ross
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  so they created the crack epidemic
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  so the same people that did that
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:16.000]  they're creating the problems that we have today
[2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:18.000]  it's just a new drug for a new era
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  amazing
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  not really, it's scary
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:24.000]  I know what you mean, I know you mean that sarcastic
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:26.000]  but it's just interesting because
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:28.000]  I mean I grew up in a world where
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  speaking for myself I actually believe
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  that conspiracy theories
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:34.000]  were the way that
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:36.000]  dumb, uninformed people explained the
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  complex world
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  you couldn't understand what was actually happening
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  you resorted to a conspiracy theory and that was a mark of
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:44.000]  a low IQ
[2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  now
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:48.000]  I always think this, the more informed
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:50.000]  the smarter the person
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  the more likely they are to be connecting the dots
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  that you're connecting so you grew up in a world
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:56.000]  where people just assumed
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:58.000]  that the system was not on the level
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  I think
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  well it's called cognitive dissonance
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:04.000]  it's like you know the government has done corrupt stuff
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  you know there's classified levels of intelligence
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  that you'll never be a part of
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  but you have cognitive dissonance thinking that the government has your back
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  they don't, it's a personal people control
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:14.000]  they want to control us
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:16.000]  and that's one of the biggest parts of why they want to keep you depressed
[2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  because Tucker when you're constantly depressed
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:20.000]  you're in what is called fight or flight
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  so your hormone response is constant
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  cortisol and that's why Brian Stelter
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  those guys that constantly have the ticker on CNN
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  how many people die, how many people die
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  because people get addicted to that hormonal response
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  and once you're in that fear state of fight or flight
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:34.000]  you can't see the forest for the tree right in front of your face
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:36.000]  so then they can literally
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  like a dog with a treat
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  they can make you do whatever you want
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:42.000]  it's more trauma what I call trauma based mind control
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  just more fear tactics
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:46.000]  in order to control you so that's what's happening now
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  is the mainstream media not you
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:50.000]  but most of the mainstream media uses fear
[2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:52.000]  to control us and that's the same mechanism
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  that the government uses
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  I couldn't agree more
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:58.000]  so three big takeaways from that
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  three big takeaways
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  and what are they
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:04.000]  there's even more than that in two minutes
[2:51:04.000 --> 2:51:06.000]  but what are the takeaways
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:08.000]  become aware of the globalist operations
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  step outside the propaganda
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:12.000]  see how they're controlling you become conscious of it
[2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:16.000]  and Tiger Carlson
[2:51:16.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  I used to think people that were conspiratorial
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:20.000]  were wrong now I see
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  that's the real world view to understand this
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  because that's what we're dealing with
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:26.000]  we don't have altruistic good leaders that want to build a better society
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:28.000]  for their children and your children
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:30.000]  we have bad people during a good cycle
[2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  that normally is true
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:34.000]  but not during corrupt cycle was Hitler out for your own good
[2:51:34.000 --> 2:51:36.000]  was Stalin
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:38.000]  was Mao
[2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:40.000]  was Genghis Khan no
[2:51:40.000 --> 2:51:42.000]  so stop being a chump
[2:51:46.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  and so
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:50.000]  those are two of the big takeaways but
[2:51:50.000 --> 2:51:52.000]  what's the third takeaway
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:56.000]  there's more than one way to skin a cat
[2:51:56.000 --> 2:51:58.000]  and what Alex Stein has done
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:52:00.000]  going out and trolling them
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  and doing all this
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:04.000]  to build up a big audience and then attack them
[2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:06.000]  with intellectual information
[2:52:06.000 --> 2:52:08.000]  that's what I did and I really wasn't conscious
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:10.000]  about it the first 10 years but on air 28
[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:12.000]  29 years
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:14.000]  but now that's where we are
[2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:16.000]  and I'm like a man that's been out in the ocean
[2:52:16.000 --> 2:52:18.000]  thrown off of ship
[2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:20.000]  for a day swimming for his life
[2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  finally finding an island to rest
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:24.000]  because that's what I love seeing
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:28.000]  is the Joe Rogan, the Tiger Carlson
[2:52:28.000 --> 2:52:30.000]  and the Alex Stein's waking up
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:32.000]  getting hardcore and realizing that the tyranny is real
[2:52:32.000 --> 2:52:34.000]  because
[2:52:34.000 --> 2:52:36.000]  that's when our real mission has been complete
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:38.000]  we are the men and women
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:40.000]  in the arena
[2:52:40.000 --> 2:52:42.000]  now I'm coming into Mara
[2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:44.000]  through the first hour
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:46.000]  and then we're going to have
[2:52:46.000 --> 2:52:48.000]  Andrew Tate, the biggest lucifer
[2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:50.000]  interview and more after that I'm going to
[2:52:52.000 --> 2:52:54.000]  fly up to Dallas
[2:52:54.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  on my buddy's helicopter
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:52:58.000]  tomorrow
[2:52:58.000 --> 2:53:00.000]  at noon
[2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:02.000]  so I can get to the studios
[2:53:02.000 --> 2:53:04.000]  of
[2:53:04.000 --> 2:53:06.000]  Steve Crowder
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:08.000]  and do his huge show
[2:53:08.000 --> 2:53:10.000]  and I'll be back in the evening
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:12.000]  but tomorrow is going to be a big show
[2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:14.000]  but tomorrow
[2:53:14.000 --> 2:53:16.000]  in the first hour I'm going to hit the news
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:18.000]  I didn't get to and all the other breaking news
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:20.000]  like this
[2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:22.000]  well this story of the London Guardian says it all doesn't it
[2:53:22.000 --> 2:53:24.000]  guns brought through
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:26.000]  credit cards
[2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:28.000]  and the US will now be trackable
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:30.000]  you're already
[2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:32.000]  giving info to the ATF
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:34.000]  you're already going to a background check
[2:53:34.000 --> 2:53:36.000]  why will they then
[2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:38.000]  they say at all gun shops
[2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:40.000]  and all sporting goods stores be put in a database
[2:53:40.000 --> 2:53:42.000]  because they're going to use that database against you outside of law
[2:53:42.000 --> 2:53:44.000]  that's corporate governance
[2:53:44.000 --> 2:53:46.000]  that's the universal credit score
[2:53:48.000 --> 2:53:50.000]  that's the social credit score
[2:53:50.000 --> 2:53:52.000]  that's their plan
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:54.000]  and that's so damn
[2:53:54.000 --> 2:53:56.000]  illegal and the governors
[2:53:56.000 --> 2:53:58.000]  and congress and others should be acting
[2:53:58.000 --> 2:54:00.000]  and they will
[2:54:00.000 --> 2:54:02.000]  but this is the enemy making their move
[2:54:02.000 --> 2:54:04.000]  and tomorrow we'll be covering
[2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:06.000]  this story out of MSN
[2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:08.000]  this robot
[2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:10.000]  catches grandma before she falls
[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:12.000]  so a robot follows grandma around
[2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:14.000]  to make sure he doesn't fall
[2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:16.000]  it surveils grandma
[2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:18.000]  it watches grandma
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:20.000]  it controls grandma
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:22.000]  it's the AI takeover
[2:54:22.000 --> 2:54:24.000]  you see that right there that's the next level
[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:26.000]  of government
[2:54:26.000 --> 2:54:28.000]  1,100 plus athletes
[2:54:28.000 --> 2:54:30.000]  die from sudden death
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  the majority just in the last year and a half
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:38.000]  and some good news
[2:54:38.000 --> 2:54:40.000]  I meant to get to this but
[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:42.000]  judge tells White House to turn over emails from
[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:44.000]  KJP
[2:54:44.000 --> 2:54:46.000]  Fauci to social media platforms
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:48.000]  where they've been directing censorship
[2:54:48.000 --> 2:54:50.000]  yeah you can censor if you want as a platform
[2:54:50.000 --> 2:54:52.000]  but not in coordination with the government
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:54.000]  that's illegal
[2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  we'll be talking about this and this big clip tomorrow
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:54:58.000]  Senator Hawley puts entire Biden regime on notice
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:00.000]  an army of whistleblowers
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:02.000]  has produced evidence that exposes
[2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:04.000]  their entire program
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  and I've got the articles here
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:08.000]  where they call it sleeper cells
[2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:10.000]  with Project Veritas
[2:55:10.000 --> 2:55:12.000]  how they see themselves as agents
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:14.000]  working against the American people
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:16.000]  we need more
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  Josh Hawley's
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  we need more
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  like the new conservative leader who's got the votes
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:24.000]  to beat Trudeau
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:26.000]  up in Canada, Pierre Hall of Air
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:28.000]  but I'll say this
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  very briefly
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:32.000]  this is a fundraiser
[2:55:32.000 --> 2:55:34.000]  this is how we stay on air
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:36.000]  it's on a founder coin
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:38.000]  the first three coins were founder coins
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:40.000]  and all founders are getting
[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  special access and benefits the only they get
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:44.000]  the other email that I'm not going to talk about on air
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:46.000]  it's inside baseball it's fight club stuff
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  but this is the fourth coin
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:50.000]  it is a fundraiser coin
[2:55:50.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  that is a piece of history and there's only 10,000
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:54.000]  of these and we need to stay on air
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:55:56.000]  plus it's amazing the man in the arena
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  Teddy Roosevelt coin
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:00.000]  Teddy Roosevelt on the front on the back
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:02.000]  a gladiator the man in the arena
[2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:04.000]  what an incredible piece of history
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  what a collector's item
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:08.000]  many of the previous coins were sold
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:10.000]  for three four times
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:12.000]  what we sold them for
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:14.000]  it is pure 999 silver
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:16.000]  silver round citizen of republic
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:18.000]  man in the arena
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:20.000]  coin
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  and the markup you see on them
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:24.000]  is to keep us on the air
[2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:26.000]  and launch special projects
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:28.000]  so thank you all for your support
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  all three of the other coins
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:32.000]  kept us on air
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:36.000]  this coin will take us to the next level
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:38.000]  and even though
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:40.000]  folks that bought the first three coins
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:42.000]  get exclusive content

[2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:54.000]  get this coin for like $39 less than retail
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:56.000]  we're going to have subscription services

[3:00:54.000 --> 3:00:56.000]  96 years old
[3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:00.000]  nobility
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:04.000]  is ungodly
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:06.000]  what does she count more
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:08.000]  than my mother dying

[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:14.000]  well my father
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:16.000]  when he was 71 oh they don't count
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:18.000]  they're just plantation workers
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  of slave landia
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:22.000]  they're not nobility
[3:01:22.000 --> 3:01:24.000]  and this guy all dressed up
[3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:26.000]  in his all his costume
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:28.000]  drag

[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:36.000]  with his costumes on
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:38.000]  the reason they do this
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:42.000]  is to make all of us
[3:01:42.000 --> 3:01:44.000]  look worthless
[3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:46.000]  nobility

[3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:54.000]  better than you

[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:02.000]  what a bunch of crap
[3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:04.000]  crap
[3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:08.000]  the reason they do this
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:10.000]  is you start with the nobility
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:12.000]  and don't forget to roll out the red carpet
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:14.000]  and dress all those little clowns
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:16.000]  up in their dread
[3:02:16.000 --> 3:02:18.000]  so they can salute
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:22.000]  and when you see the pope
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:24.000]  don't forget to kiss his ring
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:26.000]  yeah, you better not bend over
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:28.000]  you know hey
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:30.000]  that may be another thing
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:32.000]  another story

[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:42.000]  we're going to take a break in a few minutes
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:44.000]  I got a big big announcement to make
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:12:46.000]  I had one of the one most wonderful
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:48.000]  it'll be
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:50.000]  one of the most memorable
[3:12:50.000 --> 3:12:52.000]  memorable memorable
[3:12:54.000 --> 3:12:56.000]  days of my life
[3:12:56.000 --> 3:12:58.000]  that I'll never forget
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:00.000]  and I've been with presidents
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:02.000]  prime ministers and princes
[3:13:02.000 --> 3:13:04.000]  got a picture of me
[3:13:04.000 --> 3:13:06.000]  and Ronald Reagan over there
[3:13:06.000 --> 3:13:08.000]  when I picked him up
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:10.000]  at the Chicago Hilton
[3:13:10.000 --> 3:13:12.000]  when I was 30 years old
[3:13:12.000 --> 3:13:14.000]  and put on a brunch for him
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:16.000]  with
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:18.000]  our board of directors
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:20.000]  put on a
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:22.000]  concert with
[3:13:22.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  Elefants Gerald
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:26.000]  one with Deon Warwick
[3:13:26.000 --> 3:13:28.000]  the superdome back in the days
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:30.000]  when I used to work in the corporate world
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:32.000]  but on Saturday
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:36.000]  I met a man of great admiration
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:40.000]  we got together
[3:13:40.000 --> 3:13:42.000]  we want to talk about some things
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:44.000]  Van Morrison
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:46.000]  that's right
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:48.000]  he was playing at
[3:13:48.000 --> 3:13:50.000]  the Forest Hill Stadium this past weekend
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:54.000]  and the stadium was packed
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:56.000]  Tom Jones let it off
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:00.000]  and what a show these people put on
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:04.000]  here we are
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:06.000]  John Plantania
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:10.000]  Van Morrison and me
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  what a show
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:14.000]  John is a guitarist
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:16.000]  played non-stop
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:18.000]  non-stop and these aren't young cats
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:20.000]  we're all not young cats
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:22.000]  they played non-stop for the people
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  and
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:30.000]  he wanted to meet me but ironically
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:32.000]  he didn't know about a piece that I wrote
[3:14:32.000 --> 3:14:34.000]  back in
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:38.000]  two years ago in September
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:40.000]  of 2020
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:42.000]  when I come back I'm going to talk
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:44.000]  more about it
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:46.000]  but
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:48.000]  these people, these performers
[3:14:48.000 --> 3:14:50.000]  what they give the people
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:52.000]  it ain't one bad rap man
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  this guy playing
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  Armonic but picking up a saxophone
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:14:58.000]  John playing non-stop
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  man
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:02.000]  an hour and 45 minutes almost two hours
[3:15:04.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  they're giving the people what they need
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:08.000]  but
[3:15:08.000 --> 3:15:10.000]  they've gone after
[3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:12.000]  Van Morrison
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:14.000]  because he's a man of the truth
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:16.000]  a man of freedom
[3:15:16.000 --> 3:15:18.000]  and a man of peace
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:20.000]  and when I get back
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:22.000]  I'm going to tell you more about it
[3:15:22.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  when our meeting was about
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:26.000]  the time we spent
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:28.000]  and
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:32.000]  again it was a real honor to be there
[3:15:34.000 --> 3:15:36.000]  and we must unite
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:38.000]  and again when we come back
[3:15:38.000 --> 3:15:40.000]  I'm going to show you what we wrote
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:42.000]  two years ago
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:44.000]  and how we could turn this around
[3:15:46.000 --> 3:15:48.000]  because if we don't turn it around
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  we're going down
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:52.000]  it's a freak show
[3:15:52.000 --> 3:15:54.000]  and they're in charge
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:16:08.000]  we'll be right back

[3:17:58.000 --> 3:18:00.000]  Donald Trump and the magnet republicans
[3:18:00.000 --> 3:18:02.000]  represent an extremism
[3:18:02.000 --> 3:18:04.000]  that threatens the very foundations
[3:18:04.000 --> 3:18:06.000]  of our republic
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:08.000]  I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't have an operational name
[3:18:08.000 --> 3:18:10.000]  in fact I bet it does
[3:18:10.000 --> 3:18:12.000]  I bet it's called operation
[3:18:12.000 --> 3:18:14.000]  matador
[3:18:14.000 --> 3:18:16.000]  they see us as the bull
[3:18:16.000 --> 3:18:18.000]  we see a red flag
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:20.000]  in our face
[3:18:20.000 --> 3:18:22.000]  and the matador is the deep state
[3:18:22.000 --> 3:18:24.000]  with a long skinny razor shark sword
[3:18:24.000 --> 3:18:26.000]  so that when the bull lunges forward
[3:18:26.000 --> 3:18:28.000]  the matador uses the force of its weight
[3:18:28.000 --> 3:18:30.000]  to drive it into the heart
[3:18:30.000 --> 3:18:32.000]  and step aside with his cape
[3:18:32.000 --> 3:18:34.000]  as the bull
[3:18:34.000 --> 3:18:36.000]  buries himself into the dust
[3:18:36.000 --> 3:18:38.000]  they've got the ace of spades in their hand
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:40.000]  which is false flags
[3:18:40.000 --> 3:18:42.000]  before you launch a war you stage false flags
[3:18:42.000 --> 3:18:44.000]  that's the first thing you do
[3:18:44.000 --> 3:18:46.000]  after the war bad guys start wars
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:48.000]  so every time a war gets launched
[3:18:48.000 --> 3:18:50.000]  by bad guys they stage an event
[3:18:50.000 --> 3:18:52.000]  this is operation matador
[3:18:58.000 --> 3:19:00.000]  sold out for more than a year and a half
[3:19:00.000 --> 3:19:02.000]  because of supply chain breakdowns

[3:19:48.000 --> 3:19:50.000]  in the fight against the globalist
[3:19:50.000 --> 3:19:52.000]  super blue being sold out for more than a year and a half
[3:19:52.000 --> 3:20:10.000]  finally back available at infowarstore.com
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:38.000]  Hey great being on the Alex Jones show
[3:20:38.000 --> 3:20:40.000]  and remember all you can
[3:20:40.000 --> 3:20:42.000]  to support info wars
[3:20:42.000 --> 3:20:44.000]  because it's censorship
[3:20:44.000 --> 3:20:46.000]  2.0 something we warned about
[3:20:46.000 --> 3:20:48.000]  years and years ago
[3:20:48.000 --> 3:20:50.000]  that would happen
[3:20:50.000 --> 3:20:52.000]  that's the way it is
[3:20:52.000 --> 3:20:54.000]  and it's only going to get worse
[3:20:54.000 --> 3:20:56.000]  again I mentioned
[3:20:56.000 --> 3:20:58.000]  about meeting Van Morrison
[3:20:58.000 --> 3:21:00.000]  he wanted to meet me
[3:21:00.000 --> 3:21:02.000]  and he didn't know that I wrote this
[3:21:02.000 --> 3:21:04.000]  in the trans journal
[3:21:04.000 --> 3:21:06.000]  and by the way if you want to know what's going on
[3:21:06.000 --> 3:21:08.000]  you need the trans journal
[3:21:08.000 --> 3:21:10.000]  but the way he knows me is through info wars
[3:21:10.000 --> 3:21:12.000]  here we are
[3:21:14.000 --> 3:21:16.000]  John Plotania
[3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:18.000]  Van Morrison
[3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:20.000]  and me on Saturday
[3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:22.000]  Forest Hills
[3:21:22.000 --> 3:21:24.000]  great place by the way
[3:21:24.000 --> 3:21:26.000]  the old time joint you know
[3:21:26.000 --> 3:21:28.000]  and everybody was so nice
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:30.000]  anyway
[3:21:30.000 --> 3:21:32.000]  back in September
[3:21:32.000 --> 3:21:34.000]  2020
[3:21:34.000 --> 3:21:36.000]  2 years ago
[3:21:36.000 --> 3:21:38.000]  September 22nd
[3:21:38.000 --> 3:21:40.000]  we wrote
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:42.000]  back in March when New York State was locked down
[3:21:42.000 --> 3:21:44.000]  by Governor Andrew Cuomo
[3:21:44.000 --> 3:21:46.000]  this is from the trans journal
[3:21:46.000 --> 3:21:48.000]  we wrote this article
[3:21:48.000 --> 3:21:50.000]  Gerald Salenty
[3:21:50.000 --> 3:21:52.000]  was inspired to write
[3:21:52.000 --> 3:21:54.000]  two anti lockdown songs
[3:21:54.000 --> 3:21:56.000]  here's some of the lyrics
[3:21:56.000 --> 3:21:58.000]  the first one was
[3:21:58.000 --> 3:22:00.000]  How am I gonna
[3:22:00.000 --> 3:22:02.000]  how am I gonna pay my rent
[3:22:02.000 --> 3:22:04.000]  how am I gonna cut your hair
[3:22:04.000 --> 3:22:06.000]  how am I gonna serve your food
[3:22:06.000 --> 3:22:08.000]  when they won't allow you
[3:22:08.000 --> 3:22:10.000]  the other one is just some of the lyrics in the beginning of the song
[3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:12.000]  the other one is don't mask me
[3:22:12.000 --> 3:22:14.000]  don't mask me
[3:22:14.000 --> 3:22:16.000]  I'm born to be free
[3:22:16.000 --> 3:22:18.000]  not a coward, not a thief
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:20.000]  nothing to hide you can see me
[3:22:20.000 --> 3:22:22.000]  don't mask me
[3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:24.000]  Salenty had someone to put the band together
[3:22:24.000 --> 3:22:26.000]  to begin producing the songs
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:28.000]  but the lockdowns made it impossible
[3:22:28.000 --> 3:22:30.000]  to rent the studio
[3:22:30.000 --> 3:22:32.000]  etc
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:34.000]  Van Morrison to the rescue
[3:22:34.000 --> 3:22:36.000]  that's the breakout point
[3:22:36.000 --> 3:22:38.000]  and now as reported by BBC
[3:22:38.000 --> 3:22:40.000]  Van Morrison the famed singer behind Brown Eyed Girl
[3:22:40.000 --> 3:22:42.000]  and boy he did that
[3:22:42.000 --> 3:22:44.000]  then I'm telling you the phenomenal
[3:22:44.000 --> 3:22:46.000]  phenomenal
[3:22:46.000 --> 3:22:48.000]  and again all the musicians
[3:22:48.000 --> 3:22:50.000]  man these cats played
[3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:52.000]  not one big rep
[3:22:56.000 --> 3:22:58.000]  no it wasn't that it was real music
[3:22:58.000 --> 3:23:00.000]  and how they did it
[3:23:00.000 --> 3:23:02.000]  their rage kept going on
[3:23:02.000 --> 3:23:04.000]  but anyway Brown Eyed Girl
[3:23:04.000 --> 3:23:06.000]  has gone back into the studio
[3:23:06.000 --> 3:23:08.000]  to accuse British government
[3:23:08.000 --> 3:23:10.000]  of enslaving the population
[3:23:10.000 --> 3:23:12.000]  of the strict coronavirus mandates
[3:23:12.000 --> 3:23:14.000]  calling the UK government
[3:23:14.000 --> 3:23:16.000]  quote fascist bullies
[3:23:16.000 --> 3:23:18.000]  disturbing our peace
[3:23:18.000 --> 3:23:20.000]  the BBC reported
[3:23:20.000 --> 3:23:22.000]  Morrison wrote three new songs
[3:23:22.000 --> 3:23:24.000]  that include the lyric
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:26.000]  no more taking of our freedom
[3:23:26.000 --> 3:23:28.000]  and our God given rights
[3:23:28.000 --> 3:23:30.000]  pretending it's only for our safety
[3:23:30.000 --> 3:23:32.000]  when it's really to enslave
[3:23:32.000 --> 3:23:34.000]  yep
[3:23:34.000 --> 3:23:36.000]  so
[3:23:36.000 --> 3:23:38.000]  calling out the cast of quote celebrities
[3:23:38.000 --> 3:23:40.000]  telling us
[3:23:40.000 --> 3:23:42.000]  what they're supposed to feel
[3:23:42.000 --> 3:23:44.000]  and quote Morrison said they're being
[3:23:44.000 --> 3:23:46.000]  used as mouthpieces for the government
[3:23:46.000 --> 3:23:48.000]  to sell the people
[3:23:48.000 --> 3:23:50.000]  what they are peddling
[3:23:50.000 --> 3:23:52.000]  he said it is becoming rare nowadays
[3:23:52.000 --> 3:23:54.000]  to find an artist who is not afraid
[3:23:54.000 --> 3:23:56.000]  to speak out against what is high
[3:23:56.000 --> 3:23:58.000]  being widely accepted
[3:23:58.000 --> 3:24:00.000]  as groupthink
[3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:02.000]  yep
[3:24:02.000 --> 3:24:04.000]  in
[3:24:04.000 --> 3:24:06.000]  tune
[3:24:06.000 --> 3:24:08.000]  of what Gerald Slanty
[3:24:08.000 --> 3:24:10.000]  and the Trends Journal have been advising
[3:24:10.000 --> 3:24:12.000]  for decades think for yourself
[3:24:12.000 --> 3:24:14.000]  Morrison said his songs are
[3:24:14.000 --> 3:24:16.000]  not about quote telling people
[3:24:16.000 --> 3:24:18.000]  what to do or think
[3:24:18.000 --> 3:24:20.000]  it's about freedom of choice
[3:24:20.000 --> 3:24:22.000]  people have the right
[3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:24.000]  to think for themselves
[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:28.000]  the Irish Post
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:30.000]  ran an article they called on a legendary singer
[3:24:30.000 --> 3:24:32.000]  to be stripped
[3:24:32.000 --> 3:24:34.000]  of the freedom
[3:24:34.000 --> 3:24:36.000]  of Belfast Award
[3:24:36.000 --> 3:24:38.000]  he had been given
[3:24:38.000 --> 3:24:40.000]  due to his new songs
[3:24:40.000 --> 3:24:42.000]  can you imagine that
[3:24:42.000 --> 3:24:44.000]  yep
[3:24:44.000 --> 3:24:46.000]  he's stripped of
[3:24:46.000 --> 3:24:48.000]  an award he got
[3:24:48.000 --> 3:24:50.000]  because he told people to be free
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:52.000]  Ennick McDonough Brown
[3:24:52.000 --> 3:24:54.000]  a Belfast city councilist
[3:24:54.000 --> 3:24:56.000]  said Morrison received the honor
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:24:58.000]  in 2013
[3:24:58.000 --> 3:25:00.000]  and is the highest honor the city bestows
[3:25:00.000 --> 3:25:02.000]  again
[3:25:02.000 --> 3:25:04.000]  remember I wrote this in 2000
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:06.000]  this is written in the Trends Journal
[3:25:06.000 --> 3:25:08.000]  two years ago
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:10.000]  quote
[3:25:10.000 --> 3:25:12.000]  his most recent lyrics undermine
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:14.000]  the guidance in place to protect lives
[3:25:14.000 --> 3:25:16.000]  and are ignorant of established
[3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:18.000]  science
[3:25:18.000 --> 3:25:20.000]  as we grapple with COVID-19
[3:25:20.000 --> 3:25:22.000]  so I've asked the city council
[3:25:22.000 --> 3:25:24.000]  to consider revoking it
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:26.000]  okay clown lady
[3:25:26.000 --> 3:25:28.000]  hey little clown lady
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:30.000]  oh what is she
[3:25:30.000 --> 3:25:32.000]  oh city councilor
[3:25:32.000 --> 3:25:34.000]  city piece of crap
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:36.000]  star
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:38.000]  hey dumb bell
[3:25:38.000 --> 3:25:40.000]  all the jerks that you
[3:25:40.000 --> 3:25:42.000]  played with
[3:25:42.000 --> 3:25:44.000]  that robbed us of our freedom
[3:25:44.000 --> 3:25:46.000]  none of your crap worked
[3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:50.000]  and as you go to info wars
[3:25:50.000 --> 3:25:52.000]  today they got a whole list of them on there
[3:25:52.000 --> 3:25:54.000]  of all the failures
[3:25:54.000 --> 3:25:56.000]  that have happened
[3:25:56.000 --> 3:25:58.000]  with the vaccines and all the other
[3:25:58.000 --> 3:26:00.000]  made up crap
[3:26:00.000 --> 3:26:02.000]  not science
[3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:04.000]  dumb bell
[3:26:04.000 --> 3:26:06.000]  political science
[3:26:06.000 --> 3:26:08.000]  you political piece of crap
[3:26:08.000 --> 3:26:10.000]  oh a dignitary
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:12.000]  oh I may go from the city council
[3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:14.000]  and then work my way up
[3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:16.000]  and then you'll have to roll out the red carpet
[3:26:18.000 --> 3:26:20.000]  alright
[3:26:20.000 --> 3:26:22.000]  an influential California
[3:26:22.000 --> 3:26:24.000]  republican lawyer tweeted
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:26.000]  is it possible to love
[3:26:26.000 --> 3:26:28.000]  Ann Morrison more
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:30.000]  I don't know right now
[3:26:30.000 --> 3:26:32.000]  an influential
[3:26:32.000 --> 3:26:34.000]  piece of garbage
[3:26:34.000 --> 3:26:36.000]  influential to who
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:38.000]  this is propaganda
[3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:40.000]  influential
[3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:44.000]  you're a bunch of jerks
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:46.000]  you're destroying the world
[3:26:46.000 --> 3:26:48.000]  you suck the joy
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:50.000]  and beauty out of life

[3:26:52.000 --> 3:26:54.000]  freedom for you to be you

[3:26:56.000 --> 3:26:58.000]  how dare you not bow

[3:27:06.000 --> 3:27:08.000]  Robert Swan
[3:27:08.000 --> 3:27:10.000]  Northern Ireland's health minister
[3:27:10.000 --> 3:27:12.000]  call the new song
[3:27:12.000 --> 3:27:14.000]  Samaras in dangerous health minister

[3:27:18.000 --> 3:27:20.000]  of bureaucratic crap
[3:27:20.000 --> 3:27:22.000]  you're too damn stupid
[3:27:22.000 --> 3:27:24.000]  to get a job in a real world
[3:27:24.000 --> 3:27:26.000]  health minister
[3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:28.000]  that's nobility
[3:27:28.000 --> 3:27:30.000]  a minister the noble the kings up there
[3:27:30.000 --> 3:27:32.000]  then you got the princes

[3:27:34.000 --> 3:27:36.000]  minister
[3:27:36.000 --> 3:27:38.000]  minister moron

[3:27:44.000 --> 3:27:46.000]  you're too damn stupid to know
[3:27:46.000 --> 3:27:48.000]  where he got his facts
[3:27:48.000 --> 3:27:50.000]  I know where he got his facts
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:52.000]  the same way I get my facts
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:54.000]  for the trends journal only the facts
[3:27:54.000 --> 3:27:56.000]  freaky boy
[3:27:56.000 --> 3:27:58.000]  only the facts
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:28:00.000]  I know the facts
[3:28:00.000 --> 3:28:02.000]  yep
[3:28:02.000 --> 3:28:04.000]  I know where
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:06.000]  the emotions are on this
[3:28:06.000 --> 3:28:08.000]  but I will say
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:10.000]  that sort of messaging
[3:28:10.000 --> 3:28:12.000]  is dangerous
[3:28:12.000 --> 3:28:14.000]  you are the dangerous people
[3:28:14.000 --> 3:28:16.000]  that destroyed life
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:18.000]  you suck the joy out of life
[3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:20.000]  no things did not come back
[3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:22.000]  and they're gonna get worse
[3:28:22.000 --> 3:28:24.000]  and we're gonna talk about that
[3:28:24.000 --> 3:28:26.000]  we go on to write
[3:28:26.000 --> 3:28:28.000]  Morrison makes it clear
[3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:30.000]  in his new songs
[3:28:30.000 --> 3:28:32.000]  how unhappy he is
[3:28:32.000 --> 3:28:34.000]  with the way the government has taken
[3:28:34.000 --> 3:28:36.000]  away personal freedoms
[3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:38.000]  the statement said
[3:28:38.000 --> 3:28:40.000]  on his website announcing the releases
[3:28:40.000 --> 3:28:42.000]  according to OJC false
[3:28:42.000 --> 3:28:44.000]  the legendary singer
[3:28:44.000 --> 3:28:46.000]  called on the music industry to stand with him
[3:28:46.000 --> 3:28:48.000]  because concerts were
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:50.000]  where social distancing is mandated
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:28:52.000]  are not
[3:28:52.000 --> 3:28:54.000]  financially feasible
[3:28:54.000 --> 3:28:56.000]  we'll be back
[3:28:56.000 --> 3:28:58.000]  everybody knows that high quality
[3:28:58.000 --> 3:29:00.000]  fish oil does
[3:29:00.000 --> 3:29:02.000]  fantastic things for your cardiovascular system
[3:29:02.000 --> 3:29:04.000]  for your brain
[3:29:04.000 --> 3:29:06.000]  for every part of your body
[3:29:06.000 --> 3:29:08.000]  but what I don't see being promoted
[3:29:08.000 --> 3:29:10.000]  is that it has
[3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:12.000]  natural
[3:29:12.000 --> 3:29:14.000]  psychotropic effects
[3:29:14.000 --> 3:29:16.000]  it certainly does for me
[3:29:16.000 --> 3:29:18.000]  when I take a couple of these capsules
[3:29:18.000 --> 3:29:20.000]  from an hour before bed
[3:29:20.000 --> 3:29:22.000]  my sleep, my dreams are amazing
[3:29:22.000 --> 3:29:24.000]  now there are actually some studies out there
[3:29:24.000 --> 3:29:26.000]  linking it to amazing
[3:29:26.000 --> 3:29:28.000]  events in the brain
[3:29:28.000 --> 3:29:30.000]  but I want you to experience it yourself
[3:29:30.000 --> 3:29:32.000]  we know it's good for your heart
[3:29:32.000 --> 3:29:34.000]  we know it's good for your brain

[3:29:54.000 --> 3:29:56.000]  thank you all for your support
[3:29:56.000 --> 3:29:58.000]  you're really going to miss out if you don't get it
[3:29:58.000 --> 3:30:00.000]  get our great
[3:30:00.000 --> 3:30:02.000]  a bag of it here
[3:30:02.000 --> 3:30:04.000]  I mean this is from people saying
[3:30:04.000 --> 3:30:06.000]  communist
[3:30:06.000 --> 3:30:08.000]  well that's where some of the best coffee in the world
[3:30:08.000 --> 3:30:10.000]  that's wild harvested above organic
[3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:12.000]  in the volcanic soil
[3:30:12.000 --> 3:30:14.000]  better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah
[3:30:14.000 --> 3:30:16.000]  we buy it from the little farmers
[3:30:16.000 --> 3:30:18.000]  that the media calls communist but really they're just a commune
[3:30:18.000 --> 3:30:20.000]  and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee
[3:30:20.000 --> 3:30:22.000]  and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over
[3:30:22.000 --> 3:30:24.000]  so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels
[3:30:24.000 --> 3:30:26.000]  and I've been buying it for what 14 years
[3:30:26.000 --> 3:30:28.000]  and the price has never gone up

[3:30:42.000 --> 3:30:44.000]  we had like that
[3:30:44.000 --> 3:30:46.000]  I'm not sure if you want to believe it

[3:33:34.000 --> 3:33:36.000]  my meeting with
[3:33:36.000 --> 3:33:38.000]  Van Johnson
[3:33:38.000 --> 3:33:40.000]  and those great great guitarist
[3:33:40.000 --> 3:33:42.000]  John Patanya
[3:33:42.000 --> 3:33:44.000]  I was reading an article
[3:33:44.000 --> 3:33:46.000]  again this article was written
[3:33:46.000 --> 3:33:48.000]  in the trends journal
[3:33:48.000 --> 3:33:50.000]  two years ago
[3:33:50.000 --> 3:33:52.000]  Van Morrison
[3:33:52.000 --> 3:33:54.000]  on trend with Solenti
[3:33:54.000 --> 3:33:56.000]  because these are the things
[3:33:56.000 --> 3:33:58.000]  that I've been saying
[3:33:58.000 --> 3:34:00.000]  you go back to the trends journal cover
[3:34:00.000 --> 3:34:02.000]  January 28th
[3:34:02.000 --> 3:34:04.000]  2020
[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:06.000]  the COVID war began
[3:34:06.000 --> 3:34:08.000]  on Chinese Lunar New Year
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:12.000]  January 2020
[3:34:12.000 --> 3:34:14.000]  the year of the rat
[3:34:14.000 --> 3:34:16.000]  next week
[3:34:16.000 --> 3:34:18.000]  trends journal
[3:34:18.000 --> 3:34:20.000]  coronavirus 106 dead in China
[3:34:20.000 --> 3:34:22.000]  our next line was
[3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:24.000]  1.6 billion still alive
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:26.000]  what are you telling me this for
[3:34:26.000 --> 3:34:28.000]  the reason we have masses
[3:34:28.000 --> 3:34:30.000]  the air is so filthy over there
[3:34:30.000 --> 3:34:32.000]  anyway
[3:34:32.000 --> 3:34:34.000]  so we were at this right from the start
[3:34:34.000 --> 3:34:36.000]  we knew it was
[3:34:36.000 --> 3:34:38.000]  to rob us of our rights
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:40.000]  more of the new world disorder
[3:34:40.000 --> 3:34:42.000]  and the
[3:34:42.000 --> 3:34:44.000]  big taking over and the elites
[3:34:44.000 --> 3:34:46.000]  the nobility
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:48.000]  the all nobility
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:50.000]  taking over
[3:34:50.000 --> 3:34:52.000]  the big zone everything
[3:34:54.000 --> 3:34:56.000]  again
[3:34:56.000 --> 3:34:58.000]  the legendary singer called on the music industry
[3:34:58.000 --> 3:35:00.000]  to stand with him because concerts
[3:35:00.000 --> 3:35:02.000]  where social distancing is mandated
[3:35:02.000 --> 3:35:04.000]  are not financially feasible
[3:35:04.000 --> 3:35:06.000]  for the artist or the venue
[3:35:06.000 --> 3:35:08.000]  and here's our article
[3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:10.000]  again see the date
[3:35:10.000 --> 3:35:14.000]  we're making this stuff up
[3:35:14.000 --> 3:35:16.000]  Van Morrison
[3:35:16.000 --> 3:35:18.000]  he goes on to say
[3:35:18.000 --> 3:35:20.000]  Morrison goes on to claim that
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:22.000]  scientists are essentially making up
[3:35:22.000 --> 3:35:24.000]  quote crooked facts
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:26.000]  they're not scientists
[3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  these are
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:30.000]  bureaucrats
[3:35:30.000 --> 3:35:32.000]  people spelled it wrong
[3:35:32.000 --> 3:35:34.000]  they're bureaucrats
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:36.000]  they can't get a job in the real world
[3:35:36.000 --> 3:35:40.000]  they can't get a job in the political system
[3:35:40.000 --> 3:35:42.000]  in order
[3:35:42.000 --> 3:35:44.000]  for government officials to justify their mandates
[3:35:44.000 --> 3:35:46.000]  so again let's just remember
[3:35:46.000 --> 3:35:48.000]  how stupid it is
[3:35:48.000 --> 3:35:50.000]  right across the street from me
[3:35:50.000 --> 3:35:52.000]  is where they had the farmers market
[3:35:52.000 --> 3:35:54.000]  they used to have it in the street where it was fun
[3:35:54.000 --> 3:35:56.000]  but now they have it in the county parking lot
[3:35:56.000 --> 3:35:58.000]  and you have these little kindergotten people
[3:35:58.000 --> 3:36:00.000]  that call themselves adults
[3:36:00.000 --> 3:36:02.000]  drawing circles outside on the sidewalk
[3:36:02.000 --> 3:36:04.000]  six feet apart
[3:36:04.000 --> 3:36:06.000]  the wind only blows
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:08.000]  and then every six feet
[3:36:08.000 --> 3:36:10.000]  in front of the vendors circles
[3:36:10.000 --> 3:36:12.000]  the wind only blows
[3:36:12.000 --> 3:36:14.000]  in straight lines along the
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:16.000]  sidewalk and in straight lines
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:18.000]  when you're in front of the vendors
[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:20.000]  it doesn't blow up or down or around
[3:36:20.000 --> 3:36:22.000]  six feet apart
[3:36:22.000 --> 3:36:24.000]  everything he said
[3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:26.000]  Morrison said is right on line
[3:36:26.000 --> 3:36:28.000]  and I could keep going on wearing masks
[3:36:28.000 --> 3:36:30.000]  when you're in an airplane
[3:36:30.000 --> 3:36:32.000]  you could eat and drink without the mask on
[3:36:32.000 --> 3:36:34.000]  and you're not eating or drinking because the COVID knows it
[3:36:34.000 --> 3:36:36.000]  you know
[3:36:36.000 --> 3:36:38.000]  so like he said they're crooked
[3:36:38.000 --> 3:36:40.000]  and he said
[3:36:40.000 --> 3:36:42.000]  that
[3:36:42.000 --> 3:36:44.000]  in order for government officials
[3:36:44.000 --> 3:36:46.000]  to justify their mandates
[3:36:46.000 --> 3:36:48.000]  look how stupid, remember
[3:36:48.000 --> 3:36:50.000]  how stupid people are
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:52.000]  yep
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:54.000]  all little kids playing instruments
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:36:56.000]  yep there they are
[3:36:56.000 --> 3:36:58.000]  on the same line look at this
[3:36:58.000 --> 3:37:00.000]  right
[3:37:00.000 --> 3:37:02.000]  and Van Morrison
[3:37:02.000 --> 3:37:04.000]  was one of the very very very few
[3:37:04.000 --> 3:37:06.000]  hey
[3:37:06.000 --> 3:37:08.000]  Crosby stills nation young
[3:37:08.000 --> 3:37:10.000]  your little coward boys
[3:37:10.000 --> 3:37:12.000]  oh yeah but you were
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:14.000]  protesters during the Vietnam War
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:16.000]  wonder why clownies
[3:37:16.000 --> 3:37:18.000]  oh the draft would get you
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:20.000]  yeah
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:22.000]  you're all sold out
[3:37:22.000 --> 3:37:24.000]  you're listening to a moron
[3:37:24.000 --> 3:37:26.000]  Kimmel
[3:37:26.000 --> 3:37:28.000]  yeah one clown after another
[3:37:28.000 --> 3:37:30.000]  cold bear
[3:37:30.000 --> 3:37:32.000]  Morrison was only
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:34.000]  real men out there
[3:37:34.000 --> 3:37:36.000]  one of the real men
[3:37:36.000 --> 3:37:38.000]  and at one time artists
[3:37:38.000 --> 3:37:40.000]  led the charge
[3:37:40.000 --> 3:37:42.000]  no more, no more, most of them are freaks
[3:37:42.000 --> 3:37:44.000]  and this is our trend post
[3:37:44.000 --> 3:37:46.000]  in this article
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:48.000]  or our trend forecast rather
[3:37:48.000 --> 3:37:50.000]  as Marshall McClugh would emphasize
[3:37:50.000 --> 3:37:52.000]  the medium is the message
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:54.000]  as we have forecast
[3:37:54.000 --> 3:37:56.000]  art
[3:37:56.000 --> 3:37:58.000]  will be among the most powerful mediums
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:00.000]  to spread the message
[3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:02.000]  of liberty, love, joy, and beauty
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:04.000]  in an era of total corporate
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:06.000]  government control
[3:38:06.000 --> 3:38:08.000]  of the mainstream media
[3:38:08.000 --> 3:38:10.000]  entrentpreneurs
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:12.000]  who understand the missing
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:14.000]  message
[3:38:14.000 --> 3:38:16.000]  large segments
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:18.000]  of the population want to embrace
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:20.000]  and use the proper mediums
[3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:22.000]  to market them
[3:38:22.000 --> 3:38:24.000]  will reap considerable financial
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:26.000]  and emotional rewards
[3:38:34.000 --> 3:38:36.000]  art is the way of finding the true meaning
[3:38:36.000 --> 3:38:38.000]  of the human spirit
[3:38:38.000 --> 3:38:40.000]  and we talked about this
[3:38:40.000 --> 3:38:42.000]  you know he was mentioning about Davos
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:44.000]  and other things, I said people don't
[3:38:44.000 --> 3:38:46.000]  facts don't matter
[3:38:46.000 --> 3:38:48.000]  facts don't matter to people
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:50.000]  we have to win over the masses
[3:38:50.000 --> 3:38:52.000]  and the masses don't listen to facts
[3:38:52.000 --> 3:38:54.000]  I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:38:56.000]  a Yankee Doodle
[3:38:56.000 --> 3:38:58.000]  do or die
[3:38:58.000 --> 3:39:00.000]  what do you mean do or die
[3:39:00.000 --> 3:39:02.000]  do or die for world war one
[3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:04.000]  a world light us into
[3:39:04.000 --> 3:39:06.000]  by a murderous freak
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:08.000]  Woodrow Wilson
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:10.000]  a clown, Harvard Princeton
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:12.000]  yeah, former president of Princeton
[3:39:12.000 --> 3:39:14.000]  bullets bombs and banks
[3:39:14.000 --> 3:39:16.000]  this is the guy that gave us world war one
[3:39:16.000 --> 3:39:18.000]  he gave us the Federal Reserve
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:20.000]  and
[3:39:20.000 --> 3:39:22.000]  he gave us Federal
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  income tax
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:26.000]  and the IRS which is now getting
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:28.000]  80 billion dollars
[3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:30.000]  so I said to them
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:32.000]  we got to do this with art, music
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:34.000]  I said you've created
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:36.000]  the lives that you've changed
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:38.000]  and all the other great musicians
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:40.000]  we have to bring
[3:39:40.000 --> 3:39:42.000]  back that true spirit
[3:39:42.000 --> 3:39:44.000]  it's been stolen from us
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:46.000]  the Kings James Bible got it wrong
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:48.000]  they said the meek
[3:39:48.000 --> 3:39:50.000]  shall inherit the earth
[3:39:50.000 --> 3:39:52.000]  the geeks have inherited the earth
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:39:56.000]  when the geeks took over
[3:39:56.000 --> 3:39:58.000]  everything went down
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:40:00.000]  for the dressing like
[3:40:00.000 --> 3:40:02.000]  I think I'll wear a black t-shirt
[3:40:02.000 --> 3:40:04.000]  and jeans
[3:40:04.000 --> 3:40:06.000]  I'll be Zuckerberg
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:08.000]  I'll wear a blue t-shirt and jeans
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:10.000]  once upon a time
[3:40:10.000 --> 3:40:12.000]  it was hip to look good
[3:40:12.000 --> 3:40:14.000]  feel good
[3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:18.000]  rock and roll
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:20.000]  bop and stroll
[3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:22.000]  and swing and boogie
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:26.000]  and now it's one bad rap
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:30.000]  the Renaissance followed
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:32.000]  the black plague
[3:40:32.000 --> 3:40:34.000]  a la ramana a la antica
[3:40:34.000 --> 3:40:36.000]  in the man of the Romans and the
[3:40:36.000 --> 3:40:38.000]  ancients
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:40.000]  they described the quality
[3:40:40.000 --> 3:40:42.000]  of the work that they were making
[3:40:42.000 --> 3:40:44.000]  in the Renaissance
[3:40:44.000 --> 3:40:46.000]  the people-wise stuff
[3:40:46.000 --> 3:40:48.000]  that they were living low lives
[3:40:48.000 --> 3:40:50.000]  and that's why so many people would die
[3:40:52.000 --> 3:40:54.000]  they went back to the past
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:00.000]  and Van Morrison
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:02.000]  and his crew and a number of others
[3:41:04.000 --> 3:41:06.000]  Tom Jones was also there
[3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:08.000]  man the cat was singing I couldn't believe it
[3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:10.000]  21 years old
[3:41:10.000 --> 3:41:12.000]  sound like a young guy
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:14.000]  they're giving the passion
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:16.000]  the beauty, the joy
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:18.000]  the creativity
[3:41:18.000 --> 3:41:20.000]  they're giving it everything they can
[3:41:20.000 --> 3:41:22.000]  and to me that's what's going to change it
[3:41:22.000 --> 3:41:24.000]  and we need a new political system
[3:41:24.000 --> 3:41:26.000]  anybody that
[3:41:26.000 --> 3:41:28.000]  votes Republican or Democrat
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:30.000]  I don't want to talk to you
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:32.000]  I don't want to talk to you
[3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:34.000]  oh you like Bush
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:36.000]  no I like Clinton
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:38.000]  Obama I love Trump
[3:41:38.000 --> 3:41:40.000]  I don't want to hear it
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:42.000]  they've done nothing for us
[3:41:42.000 --> 3:41:44.000]  only for themselves
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:48.000]  we need a new system
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:50.000]  and art
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:52.000]  again
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:54.000]  as Marie-Pierre taught me
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:41:56.000]  is the way of finding
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:41:58.000]  the true meaning of the human spirit
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:02.000]  and it's been sucked out of us
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:04.000]  again I looked at the people
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:06.000]  I was up in Saratoga
[3:42:06.000 --> 3:42:08.000]  racetrack
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:12.000]  during Labor Day
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:14.000]  weekend, end of the races
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:16.000]  number one racetrack in America at the time
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:18.000]  on the first ones
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:20.000]  I was there 20 years ago everybody was
[3:42:20.000 --> 3:42:22.000]  dressed
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:24.000]  and that was a slob show
[3:42:24.000 --> 3:42:26.000]  some people were dressed
[3:42:26.000 --> 3:42:28.000]  80% weren't
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:30.000]  same thing at the
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  Van Morrison thing
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:34.000]  there were some nice people dressed
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:36.000]  but masses
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:38.000]  and again
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:44.000]  we're in an ultra-processed world
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:46.000]  ultra-processed with the geeks
[3:42:46.000 --> 3:42:48.000]  with their fake
[3:42:48.000 --> 3:42:50.000]  sounds
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:52.000]  an ultra-processed with fake food
[3:42:52.000 --> 3:42:54.000]  we're going to take a break and we'll be right back
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:42:56.000]  about the economy
[3:42:56.000 --> 3:42:58.000]  the rage for more than a decade
[3:42:58.000 --> 3:43:00.000]  have been concentrated
[3:43:00.000 --> 3:43:02.000]  green powders
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:04.000]  with wheat grass
[3:43:04.000 --> 3:43:06.000]  and so many other ingredients that are known
[3:43:06.000 --> 3:43:08.000]  to make us healthy
[3:43:08.000 --> 3:43:10.000]  to make us vibrant
[3:43:10.000 --> 3:43:12.000]  and to defend our immune systems
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:14.000]  now over a year and a half ago
[3:43:14.000 --> 3:43:16.000]  we came out with a product that was top sourced
[3:43:16.000 --> 3:43:18.000]  top of the line
[3:43:18.000 --> 3:43:20.000]  as good as it's going to get
[3:43:20.000 --> 3:43:22.000]  but then the supply chain broke down
[3:43:22.000 --> 3:43:24.000]  and it was sold out for more than a year
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:26.000]  finally green fiber capsules
[3:43:26.000 --> 3:43:28.000]  this big old bottle jam-packed

[3:43:50.000 --> 3:43:52.000]  we're all under globalist attack
[3:43:52.000 --> 3:43:54.000]  they don't want you to have these essential nutrients
[3:43:54.000 --> 3:43:56.000]  that are in this product
[3:43:56.000 --> 3:43:58.000]  your voice counts

[3:44:06.000 --> 3:44:08.000]  the globalists know their agenda is unpopular

[3:45:00.000 --> 3:45:02.000]  you've got turbo force
[3:45:02.000 --> 3:45:04.000]  you've got brain force plus
[3:45:04.000 --> 3:45:06.000]  and you've got brain force ultra
[3:45:06.000 --> 3:45:08.000]  which one is better
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:10.000]  and that's like asking
[3:45:10.000 --> 3:45:12.000]  what's better a Ford F-150
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:14.000]  or a Cadillac
[3:45:14.000 --> 3:45:16.000]  or a Ferrari
[3:45:16.000 --> 3:45:18.000]  different strokes for different folks
[3:45:18.000 --> 3:45:20.000]  it varies
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:22.000]  all three are different formulas
[3:45:22.000 --> 3:45:24.000]  all three do different things
[3:45:24.000 --> 3:45:26.000]  turbo force is 10 hours of clean
[3:45:26.000 --> 3:45:28.000]  out of control energy
[3:45:28.000 --> 3:45:30.000]  I can't even take a whole pack myself
[3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:32.000]  brain force plus is a

[3:45:34.000 --> 3:45:36.000]  this brain force ultra

[3:45:38.000 --> 3:45:40.000]  new tropic that
[3:45:40.000 --> 3:45:42.000]  creates incredible clarity
[3:45:42.000 --> 3:45:44.000]  but doesn't last very long

[3:46:34.000 --> 3:46:35.640]  in the world.
[3:46:35.640 --> 3:46:36.560]  Woo!
[3:46:36.560 --> 3:46:37.840]  This is major.
[3:46:37.840 --> 3:46:39.120]  This is political.
[3:46:39.120 --> 3:46:40.640]  This could fund our war chest.
[3:46:40.640 --> 3:46:42.340]  Just go to Amazon.com, everybody,
[3:46:42.340 --> 3:46:43.880]  and buy 10 copies.
[3:46:43.880 --> 3:46:46.920]  Send this blueprint to the Death Star
[3:46:46.920 --> 3:46:48.080]  and the New World Order,
[3:46:48.080 --> 3:46:49.480]  because you read this, you know their whole plan,
[3:46:49.480 --> 3:46:50.320]  how to stop them.
[3:46:50.320 --> 3:46:52.000]  Get the great reset in the world now.
[3:46:52.000 --> 3:46:53.160]  It's gonna go to number one.
[3:46:53.160 --> 3:46:54.160]  What do you make of that?
[3:46:57.760 --> 3:47:00.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:47:00.560 --> 3:47:02.320]  of the New World Order,
[3:47:02.320 --> 3:47:04.160]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:04.160 --> 3:47:27.040]  Your mom will put you on the road
[3:47:27.040 --> 3:47:29.520]  at a bed that you read to the police station.
[3:47:29.520 --> 3:47:31.120]  You went through the police station.
[3:47:31.120 --> 3:47:35.760]  When the pop will found out, and she'll start an investigation.
[3:47:35.760 --> 3:47:37.600]  It's against the law.
[3:47:37.600 --> 3:47:39.440]  What my mama saw, it was against the law.
[3:47:39.440 --> 3:47:41.640]  Yeah, goodbye, Rosie, Queen of Corona.
[3:47:41.640 --> 3:47:43.320]  Yep, Corona.
[3:47:43.320 --> 3:47:45.880]  That's to my father's side of the family.
[3:47:45.880 --> 3:47:47.520]  A lot of them live there.
[3:47:47.520 --> 3:47:49.560]  Yeah, you know, Corona.
[3:47:49.560 --> 3:47:53.080]  And you got my cousin, Liz, Queen of Corona.
[3:47:53.080 --> 3:48:00.560]  Yeah, and great Italian restaurants around there, boy.
[3:48:00.560 --> 3:48:03.400]  Yeah, I remember going there and going to the World's Fair
[3:48:03.400 --> 3:48:07.880]  from my aunt Ida's house, many rest in peace.
[3:48:07.880 --> 3:48:11.560]  1964 World's Fair.
[3:48:11.560 --> 3:48:18.680]  Anyway, those who are able to see beyond the shadows
[3:48:18.680 --> 3:48:26.440]  and lies of their culture will never be understood,
[3:48:26.440 --> 3:48:31.680]  let alone believed by the masses.
[3:48:31.680 --> 3:48:37.600]  So what we do with the trends journal giving you facts
[3:48:37.600 --> 3:48:41.480]  and information and only putting them in there,
[3:48:41.480 --> 3:48:45.760]  they're not understood by the masses who are brainwashed.
[3:48:45.760 --> 3:48:52.760]  What Van Morrison said about what's going on
[3:48:52.760 --> 3:48:57.760]  and how we're being robbed of our freedom.
[3:48:57.760 --> 3:49:03.960]  He said that the U.K. government fascist bullies
[3:49:03.960 --> 3:49:08.120]  disturbing our peace.
[3:49:08.120 --> 3:49:10.680]  He says no more taking of our freedom
[3:49:10.680 --> 3:49:13.240]  and our God given rights pretending it's only
[3:49:13.240 --> 3:49:16.960]  for our safety when it's really to enslave.
[3:49:16.960 --> 3:49:19.960]  Those are his lyrics.
[3:49:19.960 --> 3:49:23.880]  So we're doing everything we can with the trends journal.
[3:49:23.880 --> 3:49:25.800]  Artists like Van Morrison and others
[3:49:25.800 --> 3:49:27.440]  are doing it with music.
[3:49:27.440 --> 3:49:30.760]  And Info Wars is doing it in the way they're doing it
[3:49:30.760 --> 3:49:32.160]  with the information that they put out

[3:49:35.480 --> 3:49:37.960]  So you really need to do is to support those

[3:50:17.920 --> 3:50:22.000]  and it's magnificent, the work that they do.
[3:50:22.000 --> 3:50:25.320]  And then this formula, it's loaded with natural compounds
[3:50:25.320 --> 3:50:32.080]  and others to support your cognitive health.
[3:50:32.080 --> 3:50:33.640]  And you need that major boost
[3:50:33.640 --> 3:50:36.880]  and you get it with Brainforce Plus.
[3:50:36.880 --> 3:50:43.760]  So visit infowarsstore.com, infowarsstore.com.

[3:50:50.600 --> 3:50:53.400]  And so you don't want to avoid missing out
[3:50:53.400 --> 3:50:58.200]  on this massive, massive savings.
[3:50:58.200 --> 3:51:03.040]  So going back to where we left off
[3:51:03.040 --> 3:51:05.080]  about art being the way of finding
[3:51:05.080 --> 3:51:06.560]  the true meaning of the human spirit,
[3:51:06.560 --> 3:51:08.880]  I believe it with all my heart.
[3:51:08.880 --> 3:51:12.280]  And that's the only way it's going to happen
[3:51:12.280 --> 3:51:15.520]  because the masses don't care about facts.
[3:51:15.520 --> 3:51:18.480]  Our magazine is filled with facts.
[3:51:18.480 --> 3:51:21.480]  Here are people out there like Dr. Joseph Merkola,
[3:51:21.480 --> 3:51:24.600]  nothing but facts, too blacklisted,
[3:51:24.600 --> 3:51:29.080]  taken off the air on YouTube as Info Wars and others.
[3:51:29.080 --> 3:51:31.600]  So we have to unite.
[3:51:31.600 --> 3:51:35.680]  So support the artists, support Info Wars,
[3:51:35.680 --> 3:51:37.920]  support the Trends Journal.
[3:51:37.920 --> 3:51:42.800]  We're giving you what you need to lift your spirits
[3:51:42.800 --> 3:51:44.680]  in many different ways.
[3:51:44.680 --> 3:51:47.040]  And we're giving it to you in the Trends Journal,
[3:51:47.040 --> 3:51:50.960]  financially, spiritually, morally, and economically.
[3:51:50.960 --> 3:51:53.960]  We're giving you information that in trend forecasts,
[3:51:53.960 --> 3:51:55.960]  you're not going to find anywhere.
[3:51:55.960 --> 3:51:58.600]  And again, go to support the artists.
[3:51:58.600 --> 3:52:00.840]  It was so wonderful to see a packed house,
[3:52:00.840 --> 3:52:02.960]  there were people out there, you got any tickets to sale,
[3:52:02.960 --> 3:52:04.320]  you got any tickets to sale.
[3:52:04.320 --> 3:52:08.600]  So walking in, they wanted to see this so badly.
[3:52:08.600 --> 3:52:11.640]  And seeing before the clock runs out,
[3:52:11.640 --> 3:52:15.320]  I used to, how I love Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra,
[3:52:15.320 --> 3:52:16.760]  they're gone, you know.
[3:52:18.040 --> 3:52:21.720]  Everybody loves somebody sometimes.
[3:52:21.720 --> 3:52:23.360]  When the moon hits your eye,
[3:52:23.360 --> 3:52:26.960]  like a big pizza pie, that's the morning.
[3:52:26.960 --> 3:52:28.960]  Yeah, when the stars make you juice,
[3:52:28.960 --> 3:52:32.520]  just like a pasta for Zool, that's the morning.
[3:52:32.520 --> 3:52:35.760]  Bells will ring, tingling a ling, tingling a ling.
[3:52:35.760 --> 3:52:39.280]  And yeah, so anyway, they're gone.
[3:52:39.280 --> 3:52:43.000]  And support these people, you know,
[3:52:43.000 --> 3:52:45.920]  buy what they have, do what you can.
[3:52:45.920 --> 3:52:49.400]  Because if we don't unite, we're going to die.
[3:52:49.400 --> 3:52:51.000]  World War III has begun.
[3:52:52.040 --> 3:52:54.520]  You find Kremlin insists war will continue
[3:52:54.520 --> 3:52:56.240]  despite retreat.
[3:52:56.240 --> 3:52:59.520]  Ukraine recaptures dozens of settlements in northeast.
[3:52:59.520 --> 3:53:01.720]  That's the headline out of CNBC.
[3:53:02.640 --> 3:53:07.040]  Ukraine inflicts major operational defeat on Russia
[3:53:07.040 --> 3:53:09.400]  as its forces retreat.
[3:53:09.400 --> 3:53:11.400]  You know, they weren't writing about this
[3:53:11.400 --> 3:53:14.440]  with the United States in its war with Iraq,
[3:53:14.440 --> 3:53:17.280]  didn't hear about this in Afghanistan.
[3:53:17.280 --> 3:53:20.640]  Oh, you mean the United States didn't get defeated?
[3:53:20.640 --> 3:53:23.440]  How come your clowns weren't writing this every day,
[3:53:23.440 --> 3:53:24.760]  every day, every day?
[3:53:26.200 --> 3:53:29.000]  I'll tell you why, because we're prostitutes.
[3:53:29.000 --> 3:53:31.960]  We're little lemons, we're little tapas,
[3:53:31.960 --> 3:53:34.680]  we're little Anderson Cooper girly boys,
[3:53:34.680 --> 3:53:37.680]  we're little nobodies.
[3:53:37.680 --> 3:53:40.920]  My mommy was Gloria Vanderbilt.
[3:53:40.920 --> 3:53:43.240]  Oh, she must have been a celebrity too.
[3:53:43.240 --> 3:53:45.160]  Oh, no royalty.
[3:53:45.160 --> 3:53:47.960]  You wouldn't have got a job shoveling crap
[3:53:47.960 --> 3:53:50.800]  if it wasn't for your mother, so take it easy.
[3:53:53.160 --> 3:53:56.880]  These are the people that are selling us the garbage.
[3:53:56.880 --> 3:53:59.200]  Where were you with the other wars?
[3:53:59.200 --> 3:54:01.360]  You little war hawks.
[3:54:01.360 --> 3:54:06.360]  Again, look at the trends journal cover, support war,
[3:54:07.800 --> 3:54:09.120]  support Satan.
[3:54:10.360 --> 3:54:13.040]  More billions of hour dollars go in there.
[3:54:13.040 --> 3:54:16.560]  That's right, great Anthony Frieda artwork.
[3:54:16.560 --> 3:54:18.800]  We're doing everything we can.
[3:54:18.800 --> 3:54:21.760]  World War III has begun.
[3:54:21.760 --> 3:54:25.320]  It's now up to $67 billion of our money
[3:54:25.320 --> 3:54:28.280]  that's gone to Ukraine, $67 billion
[3:54:28.280 --> 3:54:30.120]  as the streets are filled with homeless,
[3:54:30.120 --> 3:54:31.640]  the bridges are rotting,
[3:54:31.640 --> 3:54:34.120]  the streets are filled with potholes,
[3:54:34.120 --> 3:54:36.560]  and people have lousy, stinking jobs
[3:54:36.560 --> 3:54:38.720]  and can't make ends meet
[3:54:38.720 --> 3:54:41.440]  to enrich the military industrial complex.
[3:54:43.120 --> 3:54:46.040]  And then on to the equity markets, it's a fuss.
[3:54:46.040 --> 3:54:47.300]  It's a joke.
[3:54:49.000 --> 3:54:50.240]  It's a joke.
[3:54:52.120 --> 3:54:54.520]  And Gregory Manorino's writing a lot about it
[3:54:54.520 --> 3:54:55.800]  in this week's article.
[3:54:57.040 --> 3:54:58.120]  It's a joke.
[3:54:58.120 --> 3:55:00.040]  The market should be in the toilet
[3:55:00.040 --> 3:55:02.760]  with the toilet bowl people that are running it.
[3:55:02.760 --> 3:55:04.360]  Bunch of crapsters.
[3:55:05.600 --> 3:55:06.940]  What are you kidding me?
[3:55:08.400 --> 3:55:11.040]  Business is nothing compared to what it used to be.
[3:55:12.640 --> 3:55:14.880]  Everywhere I go, empty buildings.
[3:55:16.560 --> 3:55:19.800]  I talked to the drivers.
[3:55:19.800 --> 3:55:21.520]  I was, well, you know, it's not the same.
[3:55:21.520 --> 3:55:24.040]  You know, a lot of people working at home.
[3:55:24.040 --> 3:55:25.760]  Office occupancy rates.
[3:55:27.280 --> 3:55:28.280]  What are they around?
[3:55:28.280 --> 3:55:31.440]  50 something percent? No, they're about 40%.
[3:55:32.680 --> 3:55:35.760]  That means 60% down from where it was.
[3:55:35.760 --> 3:55:38.320]  All the businesses that depended on it, gone.
[3:55:40.360 --> 3:55:42.960]  We're going into the worst financial crisis
[3:55:44.600 --> 3:55:47.960]  in human history, or modern history, I should say.
[3:55:49.240 --> 3:55:51.600]  And with all those fails, they take it to war
[3:55:51.600 --> 3:55:53.800]  and they're taking us to war.
[3:55:53.800 --> 3:55:55.760]  Gold prices went up today.
[3:55:55.760 --> 3:55:58.920]  Oil prices are down, but they're going back up.
[3:55:58.920 --> 3:56:01.440]  And the more this war keeps heating up,
[3:56:01.440 --> 3:56:04.920]  the worse it's going to get, particularly in Europe.
[3:56:07.120 --> 3:56:09.080]  You're going to see protests and revolutions
[3:56:09.080 --> 3:56:10.320]  like you've never seen.
[3:56:11.640 --> 3:56:14.480]  And if we don't stop this, you've got a mad woman in there,
[3:56:14.480 --> 3:56:16.640]  a little clown of a nobody, trust.
[3:56:16.640 --> 3:56:19.200]  How could your trust tell you gotta really be stupid?
[3:56:19.200 --> 3:56:21.080]  In the UK, that says she's ready
[3:56:21.080 --> 3:56:22.960]  to push a finger on the button.
[3:56:22.960 --> 3:56:24.200]  And look at the imbeciles we got
[3:56:24.200 --> 3:56:25.720]  running all the other countries.
[3:56:25.720 --> 3:56:27.360]  Are you like the little Katzone Macron,
[3:56:27.360 --> 3:56:30.600]  the little nothing of a clown, the Rothschild girl boy?
[3:56:32.040 --> 3:56:34.880]  A Rothschild, that's what he is, a child of nothing.
[3:56:34.880 --> 3:56:39.120]  An arrogant little piece of garbage, one after another.
[3:56:41.160 --> 3:56:45.160]  Support InfoWords, support the musicians,
[3:56:45.160 --> 3:56:47.640]  buy what they have, the good ones,
[3:56:47.640 --> 3:56:50.600]  not the clown boys and girls that sold out.
[3:56:50.600 --> 3:56:52.920]  And if you want to know what in the world is going on
[3:56:52.920 --> 3:56:55.680]  and what to do, you really need to Trends Journal.
[3:56:56.520 --> 3:57:00.480]  And the products from InfoWords,
[3:57:00.480 --> 3:57:03.680]  they help you and they help InfoWords.
[3:57:03.680 --> 3:57:05.280]  So you really want to get them.
[3:57:06.120 --> 3:57:09.320]  You know, we're on the path of no return
[3:57:09.320 --> 3:57:11.320]  if we don't unite for peace.
[3:57:11.320 --> 3:57:14.360]  United we stand, divided we die.
[3:57:14.360 --> 3:57:17.200]  And I don't want to check out like this.
[3:57:17.200 --> 3:57:19.280]  You know, I want to have a, I want to, you know,
[3:57:19.280 --> 3:57:21.360]  I want to boogie before the lights go out.
[3:57:21.360 --> 3:57:23.480]  There ain't not enough boogie out there, man.
[3:57:23.480 --> 3:57:26.120]  Whew, not too tight.
[3:57:26.120 --> 3:57:28.760]  Not a drop of boogie, not an ounce of jazz.
[3:57:28.760 --> 3:57:30.520]  We got to bring that back.
[3:57:30.520 --> 3:57:32.960]  Again, go to Van Morrison, check him out.
[3:57:32.960 --> 3:57:34.600]  He's touring all around.
[3:57:34.600 --> 3:57:36.600]  You're not going to want to miss him.
[3:57:36.600 --> 3:57:41.600]  And do what you can, do your part
[3:57:41.600 --> 3:57:43.240]  to get in the best shape you can
[3:57:43.240 --> 3:57:44.720]  and InfoWords will help you.
[3:57:44.720 --> 3:57:46.240]  Thank you.
[3:57:46.240 --> 3:57:50.760]  It's the fourth coin that we've released the last year.
[3:57:50.760 --> 3:57:52.320]  And I believe the most powerful,
[3:57:52.320 --> 3:57:55.560]  the man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[3:57:56.960 --> 3:58:01.000]  Citizen of a Republic, the man in the arena.
[3:58:01.000 --> 3:58:04.760]  There's only 10,000 of this coin and it exists in the world.
[3:58:04.760 --> 3:58:07.200]  It will never be made again.
[3:58:07.200 --> 3:58:09.320]  It's not just an amazing historic coin.
[3:58:09.320 --> 3:58:12.960]  It funds the information war against the globalist.
[3:58:12.960 --> 3:58:14.480]  This is something you want to hand down
[3:58:14.480 --> 3:58:15.520]  to your grandchildren.
[3:58:15.520 --> 3:58:17.240]  This is something you want to own.
[3:58:17.240 --> 3:58:20.360]  And as a fundraiser, it is funding
[3:58:20.360 --> 3:58:23.000]  the information war against the globalist.
[3:58:23.000 --> 3:58:25.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available.
[3:58:25.440 --> 3:58:27.120]  They'll sell out very quickly.
[3:58:27.120 --> 3:58:28.680]  Please be part of history.
[3:58:28.680 --> 3:58:30.680]  And thank you all for your support.
[3:58:30.680 --> 3:58:33.160]  You can go to 1776coin.com
[3:58:33.160 --> 3:58:36.120]  or you can go to patreoncollectibles.com
[3:58:36.120 --> 3:58:37.320]  and secure this coin.
[3:58:37.320 --> 3:58:40.520]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence
[3:58:40.520 --> 3:58:42.320]  and it funds the Info War.
[3:58:42.320 --> 3:58:46.560]  Man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt, 1776coin.com.
[3:58:46.560 --> 3:58:48.760]  Our world is so full of hype.
[3:58:48.760 --> 3:58:51.560]  We are force fed dehumanizing propaganda
[3:58:51.560 --> 3:58:52.800]  by the corporate media,
[3:58:52.800 --> 3:58:55.640]  by the controlled churches and the universities.
[3:58:55.640 --> 3:58:57.240]  Why is this the case?
[3:58:57.240 --> 3:58:59.800]  Because we innately, by God,
[3:58:59.800 --> 3:59:01.800]  have been given the keys for our own minds,
[3:59:01.800 --> 3:59:03.800]  our own psyche, our own souls.
[3:59:03.800 --> 3:59:06.720]  And by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves
[3:59:06.720 --> 3:59:10.720]  and transcend the quote, fallen or sinful state.
[3:59:10.720 --> 3:59:13.080]  So the chemicals that we ingest
[3:59:13.080 --> 3:59:15.640]  and all the things we've got to bring into our bodies
[3:59:15.640 --> 3:59:17.960]  to change who we are,
[3:59:17.960 --> 3:59:19.280]  are only lowering us.
[3:59:19.280 --> 3:59:20.760]  They're only making us more depressed.
[3:59:20.760 --> 3:59:23.160]  From the end, they're only making us less fulfilled.
[3:59:23.160 --> 3:59:25.160]  It is only by going within
[3:59:25.160 --> 3:59:26.560]  and really making that connection to God
[3:59:26.560 --> 3:59:28.920]  that we can truly empower ourselves.
[3:59:28.920 --> 3:59:31.800]  That's why the globe was bombarded with toxins and chemicals
[3:59:31.800 --> 3:59:34.560]  to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals
[3:59:34.560 --> 3:59:37.160]  and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy
[3:59:37.160 --> 3:59:39.800]  and to be able to basically reach out
[3:59:39.800 --> 3:59:41.360]  beyond the third dimension.
[3:59:41.360 --> 3:59:43.120]  And that's where the incredible products come in
[3:59:43.120 --> 3:59:44.400]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:59:44.400 --> 3:59:48.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[3:59:48.920 --> 4:00:14.920]  it's Alex Jones.
