[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500]  [Music]
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:17.000]   Unfortunately, for the second straight weekend, I'm gonna be having to cover
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   the perverts and the deranged, demented activity at the hands of the LGBTQ+ Pride Month Brigade.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.000]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:28.723 --> 00:00:48.599]   Which is really too sad for rational, normal, Gay people or queer people out there, whatever it is, that don't want to be involved with this, don't want to be involved with child abuse, don't want to be involved with all the propaganda, don't want to be involved in the culture wars, just want to do their own thing and be left alone like everyone else.
[00:00:49.940 --> 00:01:24.638]   But no, they're going to use you to groom and indoctrinate children so that their identity growing up is all based on their sexual Whatever's that have now been injected into their minds, the different ideas, instead of principles like courage, or integrity, or honesty, or bravery, family, loyalty, hard work.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.244]  No, it's gonna be all about what sex you are.
[00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:42.744]  And you gotta ask yourself, how is Gay Pride Month now the second, maybe the biggest thing in this country?
[00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:46.906]  And you might say, well what are you talking about?
[00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:54.211]  I doubt there is as much government spending and organizing and everything that goes into these events.
[00:01:54.971 --> 00:01:57.633]  I was thinking the only thing that comes close is maybe Christmas.
[00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:02.075]  Folks, there are hundreds of gay pride parades.
[00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:03.236]  Hundreds!
[00:02:06.434 --> 00:02:08.195]  And look at the size of these things.
[00:02:08.635 --> 00:02:10.175]  Look at all the corporate sponsors.
[00:02:14.037 --> 00:02:20.719]  Now, so, I literally have hours and hours of this from over the weekend, so I'm going to come back and let you know what's going on.
[00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:30.422]  But, I mean, quickly though, on the political side of the spectrum, Joe Biden is an absolute political disaster.
[00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.642]  His approval rating is quickly heading into the 20s.
[00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:37.704]  Historic lows, we're talking.
[00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:41.587]  Congress already crossed that threshold long ago.
[00:02:43.248 --> 00:02:45.470]  So the government is in just an abysmal failure.
[00:02:47.952 --> 00:02:59.422]  Everyone is seeing their gas prices go up, their energy prices go up, their grocery bills go up, probably their paychecks go down because their taxes are also going up.
[00:03:02.643 --> 00:03:12.946]  And no matter how much the Democrats try to blame Putin, or blame January 6th, or keep playing the blame game, it's not sticking anywhere.
[00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:17.247]  It's like the old saying, I am rubber, you are glue.
[00:03:17.307 --> 00:03:19.407]  Whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you.
[00:03:19.947 --> 00:03:21.408]  That's the Democrats right now.
[00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:29.310]  And even with January 6th, and even with January 6th, they're not changing any minds.
[00:03:30.598 --> 00:03:35.307]  In fact, neutral or inquiring minds are saying, why are they still bringing this up?
[00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:48.452]   And if you knew this was going to go down, why did you turn down the National Guard, and why did you turn down having extra police on the scene that day?
[00:03:49.113 --> 00:03:53.776]  This isn't adding up, and this doesn't affect me anyway.
[00:03:54.296 --> 00:03:55.577]  At least that's how they view it.
[00:03:56.098 --> 00:03:57.099]  A political witch hunt.
[00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:04.364]  The Democrat Party weaponizing the government against its opposition does affect all of us, but a lot of people won't understand that.
[00:04:04.404 --> 00:04:09.968]  But they do understand their gas bill going up, and their electric bill going up, and their grocery bill going up.
[00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:18.600]   and their kids coming home from school with sexual propaganda and racial propaganda.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.760]   And no amount of blame gaming by the Democrats and Biden can fix the damage
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.201]  that the Democrats have done to this country and themselves.
[00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:36.759]  [MUSIC]
[00:04:37.633 --> 00:04:38.613]  You fight against our rights.
[00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:40.755]  You say we all lead lives you can't respect.
[00:04:40.775 --> 00:04:41.495]  But you're just frightened.
[00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:45.314]   there who are still working against equal rights, we have a message for you.
[00:04:46.314 --> 00:04:54.314]   You think we're sinful, you fight against our rights, you say we all lead lives you can't respect.
[00:04:54.314 --> 00:05:04.314]   But you're just frightened, you think that we'll corrupt your kids if our agenda goes unchecked.
[00:05:04.314 --> 00:05:07.314]  It's funny.
[00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:09.427]  Just this once, you're correct.
[00:05:11.987 --> 00:05:14.228]  We'll convert your children.
[00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:16.869]  Happens bit by bit.
[00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.089]  Quietly and subtly.
[00:05:19.549 --> 00:05:22.250]  And you will barely notice it.
[00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.590]  You can keep them from disco.
[00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.231]  Warn about San Francisco.
[00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:30.432]  Make them wear pleated pants, we don't care.
[00:05:32.772 --> 00:05:34.833]  We'll convert your children.
[00:05:36.212 --> 00:05:38.474]  We'll make them tolerant and fair.
[00:05:39.735 --> 00:05:45.199]  At first I didn't get why you'd be so scared of us turning your children into accepting, caring people.
[00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:52.385]  So, buckle up, ladies and gentlemen, on this Sunday, June 12th, and let me just give you a fair warning.
[00:05:52.405 --> 00:06:04.515]  I just, I don't even know how to properly explain what it is we're about to show you today, because here's the deal.
[00:06:06.892 --> 00:06:28.972]  I'm going to tell you the serious nature of it all, and you're going to see some of this stuff, and it's going to make you nauseous and sickened, but I mean, folks, you've got to understand, we're only human here at this crew, here at InfoWars, and some of this stuff is just belly laughter worthy.
[00:06:30.562 --> 00:06:45.789]  I mean, when you've got, when you've got linebacker looking, uh, you know, NFL athlete dudes dressed up as leather daddies, dancing to Beyonce, grinding for children, and see, and that's where it gets ridiculous is the aspect of the children.
[00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.591]  And so that's when you start to get nauseous and sickened by this.
[00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:56.615]  But it's just, I mean, there's just so many different levels of ridiculousness to what's going on now.
[00:06:57.725 --> 00:07:00.226]  I mean, look at that big fat Cleveland steamer coming at ya.
[00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:03.088]  Yeah, look at that big ol' daddy dump truck!
[00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:07.090]  Slaps his butt, shakes it for the children.
[00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.991]  I mean, folks, this was happening all weekend long again.
[00:07:10.211 --> 00:07:11.652]  So, here's the fair warning.
[00:07:11.892 --> 00:07:14.113]  If you don't want to watch this stuff, I don't blame you.
[00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:14.674]  Okay?
[00:07:14.974 --> 00:07:16.175]  I don't want to watch this stuff.
[00:07:17.475 --> 00:07:20.677]  I went to one of these events here in Austin yesterday.
[00:07:20.837 --> 00:07:21.917]  I was there for about an hour.
[00:07:22.038 --> 00:07:23.838]  I saw Heontze perform.
[00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:26.240]  I mean, folks, it'd be like...
[00:07:27.276 --> 00:07:30.678]  If I got into, uh, you know, a bra and panties and said I was Shakira, okay?
[00:07:30.698 --> 00:07:33.940]  I mean, it's just... But it's Heonse!
[00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:37.223]  Probably better than the real thing, since it's a dude.
[00:07:37.563 --> 00:07:41.465]  Since men do everything better than women now, men are even better at being women than women.
[00:07:42.066 --> 00:07:43.927]  So I saw Heonse yesterday.
[00:07:44.307 --> 00:07:45.328]  Better than the real deal.
[00:07:45.608 --> 00:07:46.729]  Better than the real thing.
[00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:47.930]  There, there you go.
[00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.333]  There's some of the stuff that we're gonna be showing you coming up on the transmission today, so...
[00:07:53.502 --> 00:07:55.063]  I don't blame you if you don't want to see it.
[00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:56.585]  I don't blame you if you're tuned out.
[00:07:57.465 --> 00:07:59.968]  I understand if you're even like, why do you even show this stuff?
[00:08:00.788 --> 00:08:05.872]  Because folks, nobody else is covering it, and it's all oriented to children.
[00:08:07.314 --> 00:08:09.175]  That's the driving force.
[00:08:09.195 --> 00:08:12.898]  And if you guys go to the end of the video I uploaded yesterday, you'll see Heonsay's performance.
[00:08:12.938 --> 00:08:13.539]  I was getting down.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.841]  I was getting down to some Heonsay.
[00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:17.082]  Oh yeah.
[00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:23.265]   And you can see Taylor Hanson and a couple other Friends of the show are out there.
[00:08:24.385 --> 00:08:25.386]  And they stuck it out.
[00:08:25.846 --> 00:08:26.986]  Those troopers stuck it out.
[00:08:27.066 --> 00:08:28.526]  They were there all evening.
[00:08:28.566 --> 00:08:32.927]  They had to see about 30 different gay drag show for kids events.
[00:08:34.127 --> 00:08:35.007]  And I didn't.
[00:08:35.107 --> 00:08:37.208]  I had to... Heyonce was it for me.
[00:08:38.868 --> 00:08:42.089]  I said, once I've seen it... Heyonce, I think I've seen them all.
[00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:46.869]  And you really can't... You know, that's just... That's just the one for me.
[00:08:46.989 --> 00:08:47.450]  That was it.
[00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.330]  I saw Heyonce.
[00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:49.490]  I said, it's better than Beyonce.
[00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:49.850]  I'm done.
[00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:57.272]  But, so it'd be one thing if I wanted to come in here and, I mean, look, I'm gonna laugh, I'm not gonna lie.
[00:08:57.392 --> 00:08:58.893]  I mean, some of this stuff is ridiculous.
[00:08:58.973 --> 00:09:03.774]  I mean, 350-pound dudes in leotards, you know, humping the ground for children.
[00:09:04.235 --> 00:09:06.475]  I mean, and there's a level of humor in that.
[00:09:07.796 --> 00:09:11.177]  You know, so there's a level of, wow, these are perverts, this is grooming children.
[00:09:11.837 --> 00:09:14.899]  And then there's just, I gotta, I mean, I don't wanna go completely crazy.
[00:09:15.299 --> 00:09:18.280]  Let's at least, let's at least look at the humorous aspect of this.
[00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:21.476]  But even I feel dirty doing that.
[00:09:21.556 --> 00:09:34.081]  Even I feel dirty doing that because this is child abuse on a mass scale with the guys, with the mask, with the veil of liberalism and tolerance and gay pride.
[00:09:35.621 --> 00:09:38.442]  You can have all that stuff without the child abuse.
[00:09:39.123 --> 00:09:39.983]  Thank you very much.
[00:09:41.424 --> 00:09:42.104]  But they can't.
[00:09:43.164 --> 00:09:43.765]  Why can't they?
[00:09:43.825 --> 00:09:47.226]  Because that's what it was always about.
[00:09:47.886 --> 00:10:10.408]   It was always about Perverts and groomers having a sexual revolution that once they get the children involved, they can come out of the closet as minor attracted people, formerly called pedophiles, and then they've blurred all the lines of morals and sex.
[00:10:11.969 --> 00:10:13.450]  Which, of course, they don't believe in creation.
[00:10:13.471 --> 00:10:16.713]  They just think we're a bunch of randomized cells.
[00:10:17.293 --> 00:10:19.555]  So yeah, just go out there and stick it wherever you can.
[00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:26.804]  That's their sexual revolution, and then it's your sexual identity of, ooh, what do you stick it in?
[00:10:28.245 --> 00:10:29.786]  Or what do you stick inside of it?
[00:10:31.547 --> 00:10:33.248]  And then here's the flag for you.
[00:10:33.628 --> 00:10:35.269]  You don't have a nation's flag anymore.
[00:10:35.289 --> 00:10:40.293]  You don't have a sovereign nation-state you're from that your forefathers helped build.
[00:10:41.093 --> 00:10:41.854]  No, no, no, no.
[00:10:42.214 --> 00:10:45.356]  You've got a, hey, where do I stick my pee-pee or wee-wee?
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:52.829]  And ew, here's my flag, because I live in the global government now, and my identity is my sex.
[00:10:55.962 --> 00:10:58.243]  And so, again, I'm just rolling the B-roll here.
[00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:00.944]  I'm going to come down and go down the list.
[00:11:01.704 --> 00:11:03.145]  Got about 15 of these videos.
[00:11:03.165 --> 00:11:05.926]  I'm going to go down the list when I come back in the next segment and really focus.
[00:11:05.946 --> 00:11:09.128]  We're also going to be joined over the phone by Savannah Hernandez for a segment.
[00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:10.388]  She's still on the ground in D.C.
[00:11:10.408 --> 00:11:11.929]  where they had one of these major events yesterday.
[00:11:12.289 --> 00:11:13.349]  She got just stunning footage.
[00:11:13.369 --> 00:11:16.050]  It was in D.C., it was in Dallas, it was in Austin, it was in Houston.
[00:11:16.651 --> 00:11:19.892]  And then, another one.
[00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:22.213]  Another one.
[00:11:22.273 --> 00:11:23.053]  Where was this one?
[00:11:23.093 --> 00:11:24.174]  There's two over the weekend.
[00:11:25.748 --> 00:11:29.231]  Head of Drag Queen Story Hour organization arrested for child porn.
[00:11:30.272 --> 00:11:31.873]  That's from the National Pulse.
[00:11:34.616 --> 00:11:35.156]  Oh, really?
[00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:43.043]  Pedophiles are going to try to hide amongst the crowds of all of these other sexual perverts to get access to children when they have these events for children?
[00:11:43.383 --> 00:11:44.704]  Who could have seen that coming?
[00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:46.025]  Oh, it's already happened multiple times.
[00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:47.867]  And, oh, it happens again.
[00:11:50.049 --> 00:11:51.230]  We'll convert your children.
[00:11:52.418 --> 00:11:58.101]  Brett Blom, a former head of the Cream City LGBTQ plus thing.
[00:12:01.563 --> 00:12:05.826]  Again, I'm not trying to be, this is not a pun intended, but they rub it in your face.
[00:12:07.067 --> 00:12:11.649]  Cream City, they have Miss Kitty Litter go around reading to kids, Miss Kitty Litter.
[00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.892]  Again, I don't even know half of these sexual references that they make.
[00:12:19.074 --> 00:12:20.675]  I'm no church mouse.
[00:12:22.591 --> 00:12:23.832]  I know what Cream City means.
[00:12:24.312 --> 00:12:29.636]  I didn't know what... I didn't know what kitty litter meant, but found that out the hard way.
[00:12:32.278 --> 00:12:34.079]  Might have something to do with a dirty Sanchez.
[00:12:36.621 --> 00:12:36.721]  Oh!
[00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:38.422]  We're from Cream City!
[00:12:38.983 --> 00:12:40.224]  We're here for your children!
[00:12:40.704 --> 00:12:42.605]  We're gonna bring them to Cream City with us!
[00:12:43.786 --> 00:12:44.807]  Oh, that was a pedophile!
[00:12:45.227 --> 00:12:46.088]  Oh, shocking!
[00:12:47.785 --> 00:12:48.205]  Shocking.
[00:12:48.786 --> 00:12:59.915]  I'm shocked that Brett Blom, the former head of Cream City LGBTQ Plus Foundation, that runs a drag queen story hour for kids program, was arrested on charges of possession of child pornography.
[00:13:02.798 --> 00:13:09.623]  And was trying to put it on a social media messaging application.
[00:13:11.345 --> 00:13:12.185]  Who could have seen it coming?
[00:13:12.586 --> 00:13:19.430]   And then I was talking to Mass resistance Houston activist Tracy Shannon and Kevin Witt.
[00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.570]  And they've got one in Houston again.
[00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:22.950]  I believe it was in Houston.
[00:13:23.651 --> 00:13:25.411]  And they just broke the story earlier today.
[00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:29.272]  Guys, will you see if they have it up on the... I don't know if they have it up on their website yet.
[00:13:29.312 --> 00:13:30.472]  They were telling me they were going to break it.
[00:13:31.552 --> 00:13:34.433]  Maybe check Mass Resistance Texas or Mass Resistance Houston.
[00:13:34.453 --> 00:13:35.493]  They busted another one.
[00:13:35.773 --> 00:13:36.493]  Oh, and it's even worse.
[00:13:36.513 --> 00:13:40.954]  They send me the criminal records of this drag queen for kids.
[00:13:42.671 --> 00:13:50.436]  Like, seven drug dealing convictions, multiple prostitution convictions, and one sodomy crime against nature?
[00:13:50.255 --> 00:13:51.255]  future?
[00:13:51.255 --> 00:13:52.255]  So, yeah.
[00:13:52.255 --> 00:14:07.175]   So, oh, but Nancy Pelosi was on RuPaul's Drag Race and says this is what America's all about.
[00:14:07.191 --> 00:14:08.231]  That's right, folks.
[00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:10.832]  What I tell you, that's the Democratic Party, that's the left, that's the globalists.
[00:14:11.192 --> 00:14:11.812]  What is it all about?
[00:14:11.832 --> 00:14:16.133]  America is not about freedom, freedom of speech, right to bear arms, self-government.
[00:14:17.153 --> 00:14:17.953]  No, no, no, no.
[00:14:18.633 --> 00:14:20.553]  Rugged individualism created by God.
[00:14:20.653 --> 00:14:21.173]  No, no, no, no.
[00:14:21.554 --> 00:14:29.595]  America is now all about what you have sex with, says Nancy Pelosi, who no one wants to touch.
[00:14:32.348 --> 00:14:42.573]  These are just all the family-friendly events for kids over the weekend here you're seeing on the screen.
[00:14:42.652 --> 00:14:51.652]   Go and see San Francisco, go and turn up that disco, you'll forget you were ever upset.
[00:14:51.652 --> 00:14:56.652]   These are just all the family-friendly events for kids over the weekend here you're seeing on the screen.
[00:14:56.652 --> 00:15:00.652]  Oh yes, for children.
[00:15:00.652 --> 00:15:04.652]  All the different kinks can be explored by your kids now.
[00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:06.310]  Thanks to the left.
[00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:07.310]  Liberals.
[00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:08.211]  Democrats.
[00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:12.093]  Not a kink they won't tell your child about.
[00:15:13.073 --> 00:15:14.354]  And show for them too.
[00:15:15.055 --> 00:15:17.996]  As this was happening all over the country this weekend.
[00:15:18.216 --> 00:15:43.674]   And I... I'm really at a loss wrapping my head around the fact that Because I'm trying to argue myself out of this conclusion, but more time and effort and corporate sponsorship go into Gay Pride Month than even Christmas now.
[00:15:45.215 --> 00:15:54.433]   Because I was thinking about that when I went to The Gay Pride event for families, for kids, yesterday here in downtown Austin.
[00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:55.834]  I was there for about an hour during the day.
[00:15:56.374 --> 00:15:58.115]  Did some filming with Taylor Hanson and others.
[00:15:58.655 --> 00:16:00.116]  The video's up on the War Room channel.
[00:16:00.136 --> 00:16:01.176]  There's some funny stuff there.
[00:16:01.236 --> 00:16:02.977]  I saw a Beyonce performance.
[00:16:03.918 --> 00:16:05.118]  Better than Beyonce, folks.
[00:16:05.138 --> 00:16:05.859]  You can't even imagine.
[00:16:06.439 --> 00:16:07.919]  You know, men are better women than women now.
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.880]  So that's modern-day feminism.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.221]  Men can be women and they're better at it.
[00:16:15.134 --> 00:16:17.556]  It was really just some mild stuff when I was there.
[00:16:17.596 --> 00:16:19.197]  There wasn't much going on.
[00:16:19.237 --> 00:16:20.358]  There wasn't much in attendance.
[00:16:20.538 --> 00:16:22.800]  But later on the night, it got pretty wild and we got some footage.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:29.124]  But how do I wrap my head around the fact that... I mean, it's just true!
[00:16:30.485 --> 00:16:36.890]  Gay Pride Month is now a bigger corporate event, national event, than Christmas even.
[00:16:38.561 --> 00:16:40.503]  Here in Austin, we do some stuff for Christmas.
[00:16:40.523 --> 00:16:43.986]  We got a little park, we put a little big Christmas tree up, we do some Christmas lights.
[00:16:44.707 --> 00:16:46.008]  You know, we got a little Christmas stuff.
[00:16:46.048 --> 00:16:48.310]  Might even have a little Christmas parade and stuff.
[00:16:49.512 --> 00:16:50.192]  Down at the park.
[00:16:51.634 --> 00:16:58.040]  Fourth of July, we do fireworks, got a big band that shows up, plays the National Anthem, all kinds of festivities.
[00:16:59.461 --> 00:17:01.643]  Christmas thing lasts about three weeks, maybe four.
[00:17:02.796 --> 00:17:07.157]  July 4th stuff usually does, you know, it's that weekend, and then of course on July 4th.
[00:17:07.577 --> 00:17:09.098]  But I mean, this is the whole month!
[00:17:09.238 --> 00:17:10.018]  Every weekend!
[00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:12.539]  Every weekend!
[00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:15.720]  In multiple areas.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.541]  Huge pride events.
[00:17:18.501 --> 00:17:28.004]  And look, there's your puppy kink, and all the little puppy kinks come out, and they have their little puppy kinks on their, on their strollers, and on their leashes.
[00:17:29.178 --> 00:17:31.201]  And with their doggy masks on.
[00:17:31.843 --> 00:17:34.868]  And they go up and they pretend they're little doggies and they have the kids pet them.
[00:17:37.179 --> 00:17:40.322]  Hey look, at least there was one drag queen storytime over the weekend.
[00:17:40.342 --> 00:17:42.424]  They've pretty much eliminated the storytime.
[00:17:42.824 --> 00:17:46.127]  So how do I wrap my head around that fact?
[00:17:46.607 --> 00:17:47.628]  I'm still in denial of it.
[00:17:47.688 --> 00:17:50.370]  So let's just start showing you some of this footage.
[00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:55.195]  A lot of this is from Savannah Hernandez, who joins us in the next hour.
[00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:56.356]  She's still in D.C.
[00:17:57.136 --> 00:17:58.738]  covering some of the madness that's going on there.
[00:17:59.973 --> 00:18:00.814]  Uh, let's start.
[00:18:00.854 --> 00:18:01.515]  This is clip one.
[00:18:01.535 --> 00:18:03.657]  This is the Pride Parade in D.C.
[00:18:04.217 --> 00:18:06.019]  And, uh, they're marching right down through D.C.
[00:18:06.059 --> 00:18:10.663]  and they've got a nice transgender man that's had, uh, breast surgery.
[00:18:11.083 --> 00:18:12.505]  So, uh, three bulges.
[00:18:12.785 --> 00:18:13.846]  And this guy's close.
[00:18:14.486 --> 00:18:16.348]  And, and he's going around topless.
[00:18:16.769 --> 00:18:18.931]  And to me, what he does to this police officer is assault.
[00:18:19.931 --> 00:18:20.711]  Sexual assault.
[00:18:20.951 --> 00:18:26.213]  The police officer should arrest this individual immediately, but oh it's liberal, oh it's gay, oh it's Pride Month.
[00:18:26.513 --> 00:18:29.554]  So you're allowed to get away with sexual assault in the name of Pride Month now.
[00:18:29.854 --> 00:18:42.814]   uh... here it is in clip one this is a transsexual man walking around
[00:18:42.814 --> 00:18:45.734]   breasts out [cheering]
[00:18:45.236 --> 00:18:49.219]  And then goes up to a police officer to grind on a police officer, backing into him.
[00:18:49.659 --> 00:18:53.462]  Tell me that that's not, tell me that should not be assault.
[00:18:56.064 --> 00:18:56.865]  Are you kidding me?
[00:18:57.205 --> 00:19:04.751]  You go up to some random person in the street, and you put your ass into them, and you shake it in the air.
[00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:08.514]  That is, that is, at the very least, lewd.
[00:19:08.774 --> 00:19:10.655]  There is lewd conduct charges there.
[00:19:11.056 --> 00:19:12.297]  That is, that is absurd.
[00:19:13.837 --> 00:19:17.699]  And I feel bad for that police officer that has to be embarrassed like that.
[00:19:19.179 --> 00:19:20.980]  What an embarrassing thing to stand there.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.781]  You're trying to work as a police officer.
[00:19:23.021 --> 00:19:24.422]  You're actually trying to protect these people.
[00:19:24.442 --> 00:19:26.322]  You may not even agree with them, disagree with them, who knows.
[00:19:27.623 --> 00:19:35.906]  And you're just standing there at this event and some pervert, some dude that decides to get breast implants comes up and tries to shake his ass on you.
[00:19:36.867 --> 00:19:41.529]  I wish he would have thrown that dude to the ground and arrested him and taken him in right there.
[00:19:43.322 --> 00:19:45.063]  For lewd misconduct in public.
[00:19:45.683 --> 00:19:46.764]  Because that's what that is!
[00:19:48.204 --> 00:19:49.285]  And that's what all of this is!
[00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:54.587]  See, this is what liberalism has done.
[00:19:54.747 --> 00:19:56.348]  This is what the Democrat Party has done.
[00:19:56.708 --> 00:19:58.709]  But this is the culture of liberalism.
[00:20:01.971 --> 00:20:04.392]  It's well beyond gay pride, folks.
[00:20:05.052 --> 00:20:06.933]  Has very little to do with gay pride, in fact.
[00:20:08.137 --> 00:20:12.400]  That is, that should... People have their lives ruined.
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:33.595]  People have had their lives ruined because they step into the woods at a ball game to take a pee and some parent calls the cops and says, that man's urinating in the woods and they end up getting a lewd misconduct in front of minors charges because there's kids playing soccer at the park.
[00:20:33.635 --> 00:20:35.236]  He goes back to the woods to take a leak.
[00:20:37.668 --> 00:20:38.709]  Okay, that goes on.
[00:20:38.729 --> 00:20:40.489]  That happens.
[00:20:43.691 --> 00:20:44.731]  You can say that's good or bad.
[00:20:44.771 --> 00:20:45.632]  That goes on.
[00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:51.094]  And okay, that'll deter people from peeing at public events, for sure.
[00:20:51.454 --> 00:20:52.535]  Or peeing in public.
[00:20:52.815 --> 00:20:54.776]  You get one lewd misconduct charge.
[00:20:56.459 --> 00:20:57.839]  That'll stop people from peeing in public.
[00:20:57.859 --> 00:20:59.180]  You can argue that's legitimate or it's not.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.400]  I'm saying that goes on.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.861]  But oh, you're at a gay kink event.
[00:21:04.361 --> 00:21:05.961]  Oh, you're at a gay pride parade.
[00:21:06.362 --> 00:21:07.562]  Oh, you're a liberal.
[00:21:08.002 --> 00:21:13.163]  And so now all of a sudden you can walk around naked, grinding on people.
[00:21:15.784 --> 00:21:19.245]  How is that not lewd misconduct in front of minors?
[00:21:21.141 --> 00:21:38.255]  You're walking around, you claim to be a woman, you're walking around in a thong with a, you got the old tuck job going on, and you've got your fake breasts out, shaking them, and you go up to a police officer and you try to grind your ass on him.
[00:21:38.656 --> 00:21:40.998]  You should have been arrested on the spot.
[00:21:41.658 --> 00:21:48.164]  And I feel, my heart breaks for that police officer that has to deal with that embarrassment.
[00:21:51.291 --> 00:21:52.732]  That is just disgusting.
[00:21:53.232 --> 00:21:55.053]  Oh my god.
[00:21:55.173 --> 00:21:56.154]  It's so serious.
[00:21:57.335 --> 00:22:07.420]  I mean, this is just... Here we go, guys.
[00:22:07.781 --> 00:22:09.682]  Let's show them the puppy play gear.
[00:22:10.202 --> 00:22:11.323]  Guys, give me clip two.
[00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:12.563]  It's the puppy fetish time.
[00:22:12.623 --> 00:22:13.544]  It's gay pride, though.
[00:22:13.564 --> 00:22:14.004]  Come on now.
[00:22:18.407 --> 00:22:19.167]  All gay pride.
[00:22:19.207 --> 00:22:20.388]  Here comes your puppy fetish.
[00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:26.211]  Look, kids, we tie each other up in leashes and whips and chains.
[00:22:26.992 --> 00:22:29.353]  And we pretend we're doggies and do doggie things.
[00:22:29.373 --> 00:22:30.813]  Do you know about doggie things?
[00:22:31.773 --> 00:22:33.374]  Do you know about doggie style?
[00:22:33.394 --> 00:22:36.695]  We're gonna teach your kids all about doggie style.
[00:22:36.735 --> 00:22:37.816]  We're the puppy kinks.
[00:22:40.437 --> 00:22:44.818]  I mean, you're tuned into the Alex Jones Show.
[00:22:45.059 --> 00:22:46.299]  You're a full-grown adult.
[00:22:46.919 --> 00:22:48.540]  You're tuned into the Alex Jones Show.
[00:22:50.046 --> 00:22:57.008]  And I'm sure everybody knows all about putting on doggy play masks and doing it doggy style and puppy kinks.
[00:22:58.128 --> 00:22:59.188]  No, probably not.
[00:23:00.609 --> 00:23:10.331]  Most adults don't want to know about you wanting to pretend to be a dog and doing doggy style puppy fetish kink.
[00:23:11.031 --> 00:23:13.032]  Most adults don't want to know about that.
[00:23:14.092 --> 00:23:16.212]  But there you are promoting it for kids.
[00:23:17.093 --> 00:23:17.453]  Wow.
[00:23:17.932 --> 00:23:30.173]   liberalism you know we could just let this this fad
[00:23:30.173 --> 00:23:38.787]   this trend of degenerate liberalism Because it only has a finite amount of time, it can't exist.
[00:23:39.007 --> 00:23:41.708]  It will phase into oblivion, undoubtedly.
[00:23:41.728 --> 00:23:46.470]  The problem is, it's gonna drag us into oblivion with it.
[00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.011]  And we'd rather not go there.
[00:23:50.291 --> 00:23:53.172]  So we've got more of this activity for you.
[00:23:54.313 --> 00:23:54.973]  Unfortunately.
[00:23:55.862 --> 00:24:00.164]  Before Savannah Hernandez, who had to experience a lot of this for herself in person.
[00:24:00.184 --> 00:24:00.945]  That's always fun.
[00:24:02.486 --> 00:24:04.147]  And a lot of it was in D.C.
[00:24:04.327 --> 00:24:05.548]  Andy Noh shares this video.
[00:24:05.568 --> 00:24:08.009]  This is a drag queen story time event.
[00:24:08.109 --> 00:24:10.490]  They still do the story time every once in a while.
[00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:12.211]  Every once in a while.
[00:24:12.271 --> 00:24:14.653]  That was kind of the gateway into it.
[00:24:14.873 --> 00:24:16.394]  Oh, we're reading stories to them.
[00:24:16.434 --> 00:24:18.175]  It's an academic thing, don't you know?
[00:24:18.555 --> 00:24:20.336]  Now it's just straight up drag time.
[00:24:22.037 --> 00:24:36.388]  Dance time for kids, strip time for kids, stripper pull for kids, Kitty's first stripper pull with a drag queen, Kitty's first lap dance on a drag queen, you know, drag queen's first kitty time at the bar.
[00:24:36.408 --> 00:24:38.109]  I mean, it's not going to lick itself.
[00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.692]  So that's what's going on here.
[00:24:42.493 --> 00:24:46.096]  But hey, sometimes they still do the story time, like here in clip three.
[00:24:47.517 --> 00:24:49.098]  Don't they look so happy together?
[00:24:49.826 --> 00:24:52.546]   And of course it's all the books are all about gay how kids are gay
[00:24:52.546 --> 00:25:01.532]   Oh, yeah, two two boys and they're gay They're all happy.
[00:25:03.173 --> 00:25:03.753]  Hey.
[00:25:05.634 --> 00:25:11.777]  And I mean, hey, you know, it couldn't be, it couldn't even be like somebody just reading the book.
[00:25:11.837 --> 00:25:13.338]  I mean, this dude could be just...
[00:25:14.002 --> 00:25:16.504]  You know, in normal clothes, does he wear that every day of his life?
[00:25:16.884 --> 00:25:17.205]  Maybe?
[00:25:17.265 --> 00:25:17.625]  I don't know.
[00:25:18.065 --> 00:25:19.126]  I guess that's his normal clothes.
[00:25:19.146 --> 00:25:21.929]  See, it's all about, let's just really show the kids it all.
[00:25:22.449 --> 00:25:24.030]  Full exposure here.
[00:25:24.571 --> 00:25:25.812]  Look, you're gay.
[00:25:26.132 --> 00:25:26.913]  Look, I'm gay.
[00:25:27.173 --> 00:25:28.454]  Look, I dress like a woman.
[00:25:29.495 --> 00:25:31.276]  And it's all about how gay we all are.
[00:25:32.417 --> 00:25:38.262]  And look, you got, I mean, in that one shot alone, I see, I think, 30 gay flags.
[00:25:40.824 --> 00:25:41.805]  Pride for kids.
[00:25:41.885 --> 00:25:42.806]  Pride for kids.
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:49.022]  Yeah, you know, you ask kids from the 60s, 70s, 80s.
[00:25:49.363 --> 00:25:51.084]  Heck, even most kids probably my age.
[00:25:53.145 --> 00:25:55.687]  Say, oh, when was your first kiss?
[00:25:55.707 --> 00:25:56.628]  Who was your first kiss?
[00:25:56.648 --> 00:26:01.091]  It's like, oh, you know, my first girlfriend in high school in my car.
[00:26:01.111 --> 00:26:03.813]  Oh, you know, my first girlfriend freshman year.
[00:26:03.833 --> 00:26:05.174]  We were in a movie theater.
[00:26:05.194 --> 00:26:09.497]  Oh, we were under the bleachers at a football game.
[00:26:09.537 --> 00:26:10.438]  High school football game.
[00:26:10.618 --> 00:26:11.559]  High school dance.
[00:26:12.605 --> 00:26:14.867]  You ask kids these days, hey kids, when was your first kiss?
[00:26:15.167 --> 00:26:19.410]  It was a, it was a, it was a puppy kink at a gay pride parade!
[00:26:21.171 --> 00:26:22.913]  It was at drag queen story time!
[00:26:23.153 --> 00:26:25.494]  The dragon princess kissed me on the bum bum!
[00:26:29.577 --> 00:26:32.640]  Oh, oh, when was your first kiss, little Johnny?
[00:26:33.812 --> 00:26:38.853]  I was at the, I was at the Gay Pride Parade and a man came up and started shaking his butt for me!
[00:26:38.873 --> 00:26:40.733]  And he kissed me on the cheek!
[00:26:41.294 --> 00:26:42.454]  It was my first kiss!
[00:26:43.434 --> 00:26:44.414]  My first kiss!
[00:26:44.934 --> 00:26:47.235]  Kitty's first kiss at the Gay Pride event!
[00:26:50.475 --> 00:26:51.536]  It's like, ah, oh!
[00:26:52.756 --> 00:26:58.397]  There was a whole lineup of men wanting to kiss me when I was 8 years old at the Gay Pride event!
[00:27:01.304 --> 00:27:05.888]  Oh yeah, you ask a kid my age, oh yeah, football game, dancing, oh gay pride!
[00:27:10.191 --> 00:27:25.163]  Oh and I love this too, we've got them, they all, they get a little confused and so they start to merge some of their current things together and so they've got their support for Ukraine because they don't want to be total frauds.
[00:27:26.636 --> 00:27:28.617]  Or they just support the current thing and put it down.
[00:27:28.637 --> 00:27:31.299]  You know, like a kid with a new toy for a week or two.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.803]  Kid likes his new toy, plays with it about a week, puts it back into the toy box, gets something new.
[00:27:37.524 --> 00:27:40.946]  They don't want to fully show you they have the mind of children, the IQs of children.
[00:27:42.307 --> 00:27:44.588]  Oh, look, we still remember Ukraine, too!
[00:27:44.628 --> 00:27:47.389]  Like, hey, you know, oh, we still remember Ukraine!
[00:27:47.429 --> 00:27:48.750]  Don't worry, we still remember Ukraine!
[00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:56.314]  Where they don't let you be trans, they didn't let you leave the country if you were trans, and they don't really do the gay stuff, either.
[00:27:56.454 --> 00:27:57.994]  But, oh, there, guys, give me the audio!
[00:27:58.014 --> 00:28:00.816]  The Ukraine, yeah!
[00:28:01.636 --> 00:28:02.617]  Yeah!
[00:28:02.637 --> 00:28:02.937]  Woo!
[00:28:03.597 --> 00:28:07.439]  We didn't forget Ukraine just because we're so much gayer than we were last month!
[00:28:10.302 --> 00:28:11.963]  Look, we're gay with Ukraine, too!
[00:28:12.743 --> 00:28:14.023]  Oh, I'm so gay with Ukraine.
[00:28:15.184 --> 00:28:17.044]  Oh, I'm even gayer with Ukraine.
[00:28:17.664 --> 00:28:18.205]  Oh, yeah.
[00:28:19.465 --> 00:28:20.265]  Yeah, man.
[00:28:20.285 --> 00:28:20.925]  Like, oh.
[00:28:22.526 --> 00:28:23.106]  Oh, my gosh.
[00:28:23.146 --> 00:28:24.907]  I'm so gay for gun control, too.
[00:28:25.707 --> 00:28:28.048]  Like, I'm getting gay with gun control, okay?
[00:28:28.768 --> 00:28:30.128]  I'm getting gay with Ukraine.
[00:28:30.148 --> 00:28:30.709]  I'm getting gay.
[00:28:30.729 --> 00:28:37.691]  I'm just... Let's see how many... Let's just see how many activism things we can get gay with today.
[00:28:38.663 --> 00:28:47.950]  So we're just totally, we're gays for gun, gay with gun control, gay with Ukraine, like, we'll be gay with, gay with, gay with Islam too, like, aww.
[00:28:48.691 --> 00:28:49.311]  Oh, whoa.
[00:28:50.352 --> 00:28:50.812]  Whoa.
[00:28:54.976 --> 00:28:56.297]  So they had to throw Ukraine in there.
[00:28:56.317 --> 00:28:58.138]  It's like, hey, whoa, we still like Ukraine.
[00:28:58.418 --> 00:28:58.919]  Come on.
[00:28:59.599 --> 00:29:01.121]  We haven't forgotten all about Ukraine.
[00:29:01.741 --> 00:29:03.262]  Hey, we'll slide them right in.
[00:29:04.763 --> 00:29:07.706]  We'll jell at Ukraine right up and slide them right in.
[00:29:08.814 --> 00:29:12.899]  Hey, I'm the organizer of the Gay Pride Parade.
[00:29:15.061 --> 00:29:18.024]  Guys, we've got a group of Ukraine activists.
[00:29:18.645 --> 00:29:19.966]  They're getting gay with Ukraine.
[00:29:22.309 --> 00:29:23.691]  Where do you think we could fit them in?
[00:29:23.751 --> 00:29:25.553]  Do you think we could fit them in at the Gay Pride March?
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:33.283]  Oh, yeah, I think we've got room right in between the puppy kinks and the, um, sex slaves.
[00:29:34.464 --> 00:29:38.986]  Yes, yeah, let's put them in between the puppy kinks and the dominatrix sex slaves, yeah.
[00:29:39.867 --> 00:29:41.748]  Yeah, that'll fit nicely, yeah, I like that.
[00:29:42.428 --> 00:29:44.049]  Yeah, I like that juxtaposition there.
[00:29:44.069 --> 00:29:45.830]  That'll be real good.
[00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:46.991]  Let's do that.
[00:29:49.272 --> 00:29:49.412]  Oh!
[00:29:50.253 --> 00:29:54.475]  Oh, and don't forget, guys, we have the Texas Ticklers!
[00:29:55.950 --> 00:30:01.873]  Guys, give me, in clip 5 here, let's look at the Texas Ticklers.
[00:30:04.074 --> 00:30:07.016]  Oh yeah, so hot.
[00:30:08.817 --> 00:30:10.618]  Oh my gosh, listen to this!
[00:30:11.538 --> 00:30:16.501]  Folks, this was in Austin, Texas.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.721]  You know, I tell you what, they, uh...
[00:30:20.721 --> 00:30:25.720]  So they, uh... It's for kids, guys.
[00:30:25.632 --> 00:30:27.133]  These guys are dry-humping the air.
[00:30:27.153 --> 00:30:34.659]  I mean, again, if I went into a strip club or a gay bar or saw something like that, I'd laugh and I wouldn't really be interested, but I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:30:34.679 --> 00:30:38.322]  It's like, oh, hey, there's a family-friendly event down at the public park.
[00:30:38.342 --> 00:30:39.903]  And then, bingo!
[00:30:39.963 --> 00:30:41.144]  The Texas Ticklers!
[00:30:41.224 --> 00:30:41.724]  Whoa!
[00:30:42.945 --> 00:30:43.245]  Whoa!
[00:30:43.325 --> 00:30:43.886]  Hey, whoa!
[00:30:44.686 --> 00:30:45.427]  What are you doing there?
[00:30:47.228 --> 00:30:48.209]  You didn't warn me, Doc!
[00:30:50.751 --> 00:30:51.331]  Oh, sorry!
[00:30:51.491 --> 00:30:53.313]  You didn't know the Texas Tickler was coming?
[00:30:55.006 --> 00:30:57.627]  What do you think Texas Tickler means, folks?
[00:30:59.568 --> 00:31:01.208]  You think that's child-friendly?
[00:31:01.308 --> 00:31:02.289]  A little Texas Tickler?
[00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:05.029]  For kids?
[00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:07.730]  Hey kids, let me tell you all about the Texas Tickler.
[00:31:08.171 --> 00:31:10.011]  Let me tell you all about the Cleveland Steamer.
[00:31:10.831 --> 00:31:14.313]  Hey kiddos, we're gonna tell you all about the Dirty Sanchez.
[00:31:17.994 --> 00:31:19.254]  I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:31:20.495 --> 00:31:21.935]  They made this public park.
[00:31:22.836 --> 00:31:23.476]  I mean, what?
[00:31:25.089 --> 00:31:26.911]  They made this public park in Austin.
[00:31:27.312 --> 00:31:28.973]  They opened it last summer.
[00:31:29.254 --> 00:31:30.275]  They did a pretty good job.
[00:31:32.958 --> 00:31:36.441]  There's a bit of a problem they're having because the whole thing is really confusing.
[00:31:36.602 --> 00:31:40.346]  The layout, and they got construction on multiple ends, so there's no street access to it.
[00:31:40.646 --> 00:31:41.947]  So it's hard to even get in the thing.
[00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.853]  But I mean, you know, it's a nice little concert venue they have there.
[00:31:48.837 --> 00:32:03.836]  And I'm leaving yesterday, and I know that people have a hard time finding it, because I've been to this venue before, and I can tell people are kind of walking around confused, and they can see that I had come from the event, and people start asking me, they're like, hey, how do you get in?
[00:32:03.876 --> 00:32:05.478]  And they didn't really know how to ask.
[00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.891]  I talked to three different groups of people, and they didn't really know how to ask.
[00:32:09.231 --> 00:32:10.691]  So I said, hey, where's the event?
[00:32:11.171 --> 00:32:12.351]  One said, hey, where's the parade?
[00:32:12.431 --> 00:32:13.411]  One said, hey, where's the party?
[00:32:13.732 --> 00:32:14.972]  And so they didn't really know what to say.
[00:32:15.252 --> 00:32:20.933]  So I responded the same way every time to them, because I didn't know how else to say it either, because there's all kinds of stuff going on in Austin, Texas on a weekend.
[00:32:21.413 --> 00:32:21.973]  All kinds of stuff.
[00:32:22.353 --> 00:32:23.134]  So I really didn't know.
[00:32:23.154 --> 00:32:25.654]  And they said, hey, where's the event?
[00:32:25.694 --> 00:32:26.634]  I said, you mean the gay thing?
[00:32:26.654 --> 00:32:27.995]  Yeah, that.
[00:32:28.315 --> 00:32:28.615]  They knew.
[00:32:28.915 --> 00:32:30.115]  They said, yeah, the gay thing's in there.
[00:32:30.135 --> 00:32:31.415]  And hey, where's the parade?
[00:32:31.455 --> 00:32:32.255]  Oh, you mean the gay thing?
[00:32:32.356 --> 00:32:33.576]  It's like, yeah, yeah, it's over there.
[00:32:34.056 --> 00:32:34.336]  Thank you.
[00:32:35.942 --> 00:32:37.282]  Hey, where's the, uh, where's that party?
[00:32:37.422 --> 00:32:38.162]  Oh, you mean the gay thing?
[00:32:38.803 --> 00:32:39.983]  Yeah, yeah, the gay thing's right through there.
[00:32:40.003 --> 00:32:40.523]  You gotta go over there.
[00:32:40.783 --> 00:32:41.203]  Oh, thank you.
[00:32:43.784 --> 00:32:45.324]  The Texas Tickler, kiddos.
[00:32:46.744 --> 00:32:47.805]  The Texas Tickler.
[00:32:48.485 --> 00:32:50.145]  Next, we're gonna tell you about the Puppy Kink.
[00:32:50.625 --> 00:32:51.505]  Oh, don't worry, folks.
[00:32:51.605 --> 00:32:52.806]  I've got much more to come.
[00:32:53.086 --> 00:32:53.866]  More of that.
[00:32:54.686 --> 00:32:54.966]  Yes.
[00:32:55.686 --> 00:32:55.986]  Good.
[00:32:56.066 --> 00:32:56.786]  Good for kids.
[00:32:58.087 --> 00:33:03.468]  This is totally normal, what you're watching.
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.220]  Nothing to see here.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.561]  Not a pervert.
[00:33:07.921 --> 00:33:09.121]  Not a sexual deviant.
[00:33:09.141 --> 00:33:13.402]  I mean, talk about illustrative.
[00:33:13.422 --> 00:33:20.343]  A sexual deviant leading a bunch of children around a parade.
[00:33:20.363 --> 00:33:26.604]  Our coverage continues from the madness over the weekend.
[00:33:28.265 --> 00:33:40.008]   I'm sorry that for the second straight weekend my theme for the transmission is How the perverts are grooming your children, but no one else is really warning you about it.
[00:33:40.068 --> 00:33:45.690]  Nobody else is really putting a light on these cockroaches, so we'll continue to do just that.
[00:33:46.891 --> 00:33:48.912]  Here is more from Taylor Hanson.
[00:33:48.952 --> 00:33:54.715]  He was at the Drag Queen for Kids show, the Pride event here in Austin, Texas.
[00:33:55.075 --> 00:33:59.275]   and uh... this is yet another drag queen going into the crowd and uh... getting
[00:33:59.275 --> 00:34:12.355]   right up in the children's faces and clip six what is the purpose of this evening
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:13.600]  Yeah, there's the kiddos.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.320]  Yeah, get right into those kids.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:15.721]  Yeah.
[00:34:16.661 --> 00:34:17.001]  Notice.
[00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:21.282]  Spots the kids from the stage, and then goes right down in front of the children.
[00:34:23.383 --> 00:34:27.384]  I'm sure that wasn't, uh... the plan.
[00:34:28.825 --> 00:34:29.745]  Just happened that way.
[00:34:31.306 --> 00:34:34.847]  Hey, let's just play some 80s music or something, or some 60s, and just...
[00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:38.053]  You know, let's just put a man in drag.
[00:34:38.353 --> 00:34:39.094]  It's called For Kids.
[00:34:39.695 --> 00:34:40.636]  That's good entertainment.
[00:34:41.818 --> 00:34:45.824]  I mean, it's like, again, they have a whole month of this crap.
[00:34:46.645 --> 00:34:49.510]  All the corporate sponsorship, all the big events, it's bigger than Christmas now.
[00:34:50.902 --> 00:34:52.002]  They could have just had a normal day.
[00:34:52.042 --> 00:34:53.123]  They just could have... I mean, why not?
[00:34:53.163 --> 00:34:54.203]  Adventure time for kids.
[00:34:54.243 --> 00:34:55.383]  Discovery time for kids.
[00:34:55.443 --> 00:34:56.423]  Learning time for kids.
[00:34:56.503 --> 00:34:57.444]  Music time for kids.
[00:34:57.464 --> 00:34:58.244]  Like, anything.
[00:34:58.464 --> 00:34:59.124]  Anything innocent.
[00:34:59.164 --> 00:34:59.744]  Anything normal.
[00:34:59.864 --> 00:35:01.024]  They could have taken all the funding.
[00:35:01.244 --> 00:35:02.845]  They could have had great bands playing.
[00:35:03.585 --> 00:35:08.146]  They could have had little Disney performances of their favorite movies and stuff like that.
[00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:09.106]  Mascots running around.
[00:35:09.306 --> 00:35:11.347]  They could have done, you know, normal stuff!
[00:35:12.605 --> 00:35:21.074]  We could have spent the millions on normal activities for kids, and wholesome activities, and actual family-friendly stuff, and actually have a learning experience.
[00:35:21.554 --> 00:35:25.158]  No, because it's all about sexually grooming the children.
[00:35:25.418 --> 00:35:29.902]  So we disguise it as this family-friendly thing, but we all know what's really going on.
[00:35:31.027 --> 00:35:32.248]  It's not about the kids.
[00:35:32.288 --> 00:35:33.549]  It's not about having fun with the kids.
[00:35:33.809 --> 00:35:34.889]  It's about us.
[00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:39.452]  It's about us sexualizing the kids.
[00:35:39.812 --> 00:35:40.893]  That's what it's really about.
[00:35:40.993 --> 00:35:42.234]  It's not about the kids having fun.
[00:35:42.334 --> 00:35:47.397]  It's about us subjugating the kids because we're leftists.
[00:35:47.637 --> 00:35:48.538]  We're liberals.
[00:35:48.918 --> 00:35:49.818]  We're democrats.
[00:35:49.878 --> 00:35:51.279]  We need to subjugate things.
[00:35:51.339 --> 00:35:52.320]  We need subjects.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:53.881]  The kids are our subjects.
[00:35:56.018 --> 00:36:02.401]  But imagine, all the fanfare, they have that big beautiful park, there's a little park there too, a little playground, all those booths and everything.
[00:36:02.942 --> 00:36:13.687]  They could have done an event that would have actually been awesome for kids, but instead they use it to groom and sexualize and indoctrinate them.
[00:36:14.628 --> 00:36:17.329]  Kids don't know whether they're having fun or not, they don't know what's going on.
[00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:24.433]  They just see a dude coming up to them, dancing around, singing, laughing, and they say, okay, I guess I'm having fun now.
[00:36:26.067 --> 00:36:28.589]  Daddy says it's okay for this person to be touching me.
[00:36:30.851 --> 00:36:32.092]  I mean, what is this, folks?
[00:36:32.132 --> 00:36:33.213]  You're just seeing it on the screen.
[00:36:33.233 --> 00:36:35.895]  It's just, it's out of control.
[00:36:37.497 --> 00:36:39.879]  But, I mean, imagine, imagine they actually, like, had a fair.
[00:36:39.919 --> 00:36:42.601]  Maybe a, oh, I don't know, put up a Ferris wheel or something.
[00:36:42.621 --> 00:36:44.042]  I mean, God forbid.
[00:36:44.062 --> 00:36:50.127]  No, it's all, it's all gonna be gay activities all month long.
[00:36:52.629 --> 00:36:54.171]  Not carnival games, or...
[00:36:55.461 --> 00:36:56.462]  Anything like that.
[00:36:57.142 --> 00:36:57.423]  No.
[00:36:57.823 --> 00:37:00.245]  Not cartoon characters or anything like that.
[00:37:00.265 --> 00:37:03.808]  I don't know, maybe some, maybe, maybe a petting zoo.
[00:37:04.469 --> 00:37:07.631]  Maybe pet the ponies, you know, pet the little lambs.
[00:37:08.512 --> 00:37:09.513]  Feed the goats.
[00:37:11.675 --> 00:37:13.576]  I mean, I'll go to a local farmer's market.
[00:37:13.596 --> 00:37:15.318]  They'll have a little petting zoo out there for the kids.
[00:37:17.347 --> 00:37:18.447]  Oh, at the gay pride stuff?
[00:37:18.527 --> 00:37:27.909]  No, it's all about let's get kinks, and let's get gay dancers, and let's get tranny dancers, and let's get top and bottom surgery performers, and let's show the kids that.
[00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:29.489]  That's what we're going to do for the kids.
[00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:31.330]  That's what we're going to spend the millions on.
[00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:32.950]  That's what we're going to do the planning with.
[00:37:35.471 --> 00:37:37.291]  Stuff children are actually into?
[00:37:38.031 --> 00:37:39.832]  Stuff that's actually themed for kids?
[00:37:40.472 --> 00:37:42.692]  That kids have loved forever?
[00:37:44.112 --> 00:37:45.413]  No, we're not doing that.
[00:37:45.473 --> 00:37:46.733]  We're making it gay.
[00:37:48.604 --> 00:37:49.645]  Alright, let's continue.
[00:37:50.265 --> 00:37:59.473]  Here's a child in the front row as the drag performer for Children is dancing in front of them requesting that the child touch his breasts in clip 7.
[00:37:59.313 --> 00:38:08.873]   clip 7 little kids in the front row
[00:38:08.873 --> 00:38:16.872]   as this dude pretending to be a woman does a strip tease
[00:38:16.872 --> 00:38:27.633]   because this is what kids want They want, I mean, you go talk to kids.
[00:38:28.473 --> 00:38:28.754]  See that?
[00:38:28.834 --> 00:38:31.596]  Oh yeah, he looks right at the kid and goes, yeah, look at these.
[00:38:31.616 --> 00:38:32.637]  How do you like these?
[00:38:34.658 --> 00:38:35.579]  Oh my gosh.
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.481]  You see it at the beginning of the clip here.
[00:38:37.981 --> 00:38:40.183]  Looks right at the kid and says, how do you like these puppies?
[00:38:42.965 --> 00:38:43.706]  Oh jeez.
[00:38:45.947 --> 00:38:47.208]  Oh my gosh.
[00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:49.109]  Take it, take it down, take it off the screen.
[00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:59.109]   *sigh* *laughs*
[00:38:59.109 --> 00:39:04.109]  This is just so ridiculous.
[00:39:04.654 --> 00:39:05.655]  I'm sorry, man.
[00:39:07.016 --> 00:39:08.397]  I just can't even believe it, man.
[00:39:09.158 --> 00:39:15.343]  I just, you know, I feel like I'm not that far removed from being a kid.
[00:39:15.363 --> 00:39:23.620]   I mean, I'm only 32.
[00:39:21.259 --> 00:39:23.620]  So I'm, I'm, you know, I'm 20 years removed from this stuff.
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.121]  It's not that long ago.
[00:39:25.821 --> 00:39:27.842]  This was never going on!
[00:39:28.443 --> 00:39:31.204]  No, nothing anywhere near this!
[00:39:33.765 --> 00:39:34.386]  And you know what?
[00:39:35.827 --> 00:39:38.848]  Whether, whether it was straight kids or gay kids, you know what?
[00:39:38.868 --> 00:39:40.209]  We all like the same stuff.
[00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:42.230]  We all like playing the same games.
[00:39:43.131 --> 00:39:43.851]  We all did it.
[00:39:44.631 --> 00:39:47.393]  Look at, does that kid look like he's having fun right there, that little girl?
[00:39:48.462 --> 00:39:50.523]  See, you know, that is everything right there.
[00:39:50.783 --> 00:39:53.304]  That is everything, that little image right there.
[00:39:54.065 --> 00:39:57.846]  Guys, guys, pull that back for me.
[00:39:58.147 --> 00:40:06.210]  Right before that, you'll see, there's a group of... I'm telling you, this has nothing... The only purpose this serves for children is grooming them.
[00:40:06.291 --> 00:40:07.971]  This is all for the gay community.
[00:40:07.991 --> 00:40:09.652]  This is all for these demented adults.
[00:40:09.712 --> 00:40:11.173]  Does that girl look like she's having fun?
[00:40:12.392 --> 00:40:14.336]  Or is it all the parents around her?
[00:40:14.576 --> 00:40:15.217]  All the parents?
[00:40:15.277 --> 00:40:17.281]  All the leftist liberal democrat parents around her?
[00:40:17.521 --> 00:40:18.623]  Who are the ones having fun?
[00:40:18.844 --> 00:40:19.505]  The little girl?
[00:40:19.545 --> 00:40:20.186]  The little kid?
[00:40:20.246 --> 00:40:20.867]  Or the parents?
[00:40:23.051 --> 00:40:24.013]  It's all about them.
[00:40:24.353 --> 00:40:25.515]  It's always all about them.
[00:40:27.145 --> 00:40:36.012]  It's funny, I mean, look, I can sit here and I can go down the list of negative characteristic and character traits and personal traits and it's a liberal that possesses all of them.
[00:40:36.532 --> 00:40:38.193]  That's just more proof right there of the selfishness.
[00:40:38.734 --> 00:40:40.275]  But again, there's more proof they're showing the images.
[00:40:40.295 --> 00:40:41.776]  The kids aren't having fun at these things.
[00:40:42.536 --> 00:40:43.637]  The kids don't want to be there.
[00:40:44.798 --> 00:40:45.839]  They're forced to go there.
[00:40:46.359 --> 00:40:48.701]  And it's all the adults that are the ones having fun.
[00:40:48.821 --> 00:40:55.426]  And they just pretend it's for kids because they're grooming the kids because they have a level of sexual perversion and deviant in them.
[00:40:56.425 --> 00:40:57.885]  I think that's pretty obvious at this point.
[00:40:59.105 --> 00:41:05.607]  But hey, if that little girl was maybe on a ferry, like a ferris wheel or something, or a merry-go-round, maybe petting a pony, you know?
[00:41:07.007 --> 00:41:12.788]  You think she'd be having fun, or maybe there was a performer singing, like, one of her favorite Disney songs, like, from Frozen or something like that?
[00:41:12.888 --> 00:41:13.848]  You think she'd be having fun then?
[00:41:14.048 --> 00:41:15.648]  Yeah, because that's what kids like!
[00:41:16.008 --> 00:41:17.349]  And that's what kids have always liked!
[00:41:17.389 --> 00:41:20.829]  But see, we're not, we're not having this event for the children, are we?
[00:41:20.889 --> 00:41:25.110]  No, we're having this event for all the adults, and we're just pretending it's for the children.
[00:41:26.769 --> 00:41:30.151]  When really it's just all for the gay, selfish needs of the adults.
[00:41:31.873 --> 00:41:34.695]  That also have an agenda to groom the children.
[00:41:34.735 --> 00:41:35.475]  They brag about it.
[00:41:35.895 --> 00:41:36.676]  Here's another one, guys.
[00:41:36.696 --> 00:41:37.777]  Let's go to the drag queen.
[00:41:38.137 --> 00:41:39.798]  Here dancing and doing the splits.
[00:41:39.838 --> 00:41:42.680]  Just shaking that stuff for the kids in clip 8.
[00:41:46.543 --> 00:41:48.764]  Oh yeah, here comes Big Daddy Dump Truck.
[00:41:51.406 --> 00:41:51.967]  Yeah!
[00:41:52.807 --> 00:41:53.388]  For kids!
[00:41:56.091 --> 00:41:58.091]  I mean, are you kidding me?
[00:41:58.091 --> 00:42:07.091]  [MUSIC]
[00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:09.091]  Folks, I just, I'm at a loss.
[00:42:09.091 --> 00:42:10.091]  (upbeat music)
[00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:29.268]   Who wants to see some Oswald Cobblepot looking freak in a rainbow leotard and a wig I mean, folks, this is like, and it's just right there literally humping, dry humping the ground right in front of children.
[00:42:30.068 --> 00:42:33.370]  Spreading his legs like a stripper.
[00:42:33.391 --> 00:42:35.292]  It's for kids, guys.
[00:42:35.332 --> 00:42:36.352]  It's all for kids, though.
[00:42:37.573 --> 00:42:38.914]  Okay, well, that was fun.
[00:42:39.474 --> 00:42:41.296]  Oh, and I've only gotten through half of the list.
[00:42:42.476 --> 00:42:44.458]  So, I've got more coming up here, folks.
[00:42:45.987 --> 00:42:47.228]  No one else is covering this stuff.
[00:42:47.288 --> 00:42:48.550]  I don't blame them, quite frankly.
[00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:50.211]  But we're going to warn you.
[00:42:50.271 --> 00:42:50.972]  We're going to warn you.
[00:42:51.012 --> 00:42:51.873]  The Liberals are coming.
[00:42:51.913 --> 00:42:52.774]  The Liberals are coming.
[00:42:52.834 --> 00:42:54.075]  And they're coming for your kids.
[00:42:54.816 --> 00:43:00.721]  And they're coming with some of the most perverted, deviant stuff that you have ever seen.
[00:43:02.363 --> 00:43:06.086]  And we haven't even had enough time in this hour to cover it.
[00:43:06.367 --> 00:43:07.407]  Sadly, more coming.
[00:43:07.407 --> 00:43:13.407]  [MUSIC]
[00:43:13.407 --> 00:43:17.487]   Well, the Biden administration is playing the blame game for
[00:43:17.487 --> 00:43:22.687]   the absolute economic devastation that has happened since Biden took office and
[00:43:22.687 --> 00:43:24.367]  the Democrats took over.
[00:43:24.367 --> 00:43:25.206]  (laughs)
[00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:26.551]  And there's no hiding it, though.
[00:43:26.591 --> 00:43:27.872]  Everybody knows what's going on.
[00:43:29.013 --> 00:43:29.693]  But here's a...
[00:43:30.789 --> 00:43:35.588]   compilation of Biden trying to claim, because remember they admit, oh yeah, inflation's high,
[00:43:35.588 --> 00:43:40.308]   it's Putin, gas prices high, it's Putin, but then they say it's the greatest economic recovery ever.
[00:43:40.308 --> 00:43:44.228]   So here's Biden lying to the American people, the Biden administration, telling you how good it is.
[00:43:44.228 --> 00:43:49.110]   I would put food on the table for their kids to be able to have a little bit of breathing room.
[00:43:49.110 --> 00:44:01.909]   As my dad would then say, with a little breathing room, to give families just a little bit more breathing room.
[00:44:02.016 --> 00:44:05.337]  We give them a little bit of breathing room every month.
[00:44:06.238 --> 00:44:09.419]  Providing some extra breathing room for families.
[00:44:09.439 --> 00:44:12.220]  My dad would just say, just a little breathing room.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.861]  We're just looking for a little bit of breathing room.
[00:44:14.921 --> 00:44:18.162]  But as my dad used to say, just a little more breathing room.
[00:44:18.242 --> 00:44:22.103]  In order to provide a little breathing room for millions of American families.
[00:44:22.203 --> 00:44:23.984]  Finally have a little more breathing room.
[00:44:24.827 --> 00:44:26.148]  It's a little bit of breathing room.
[00:44:26.608 --> 00:44:27.689]  Just a little breathing room.
[00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:29.170]  A little bit of breathing room.
[00:44:29.511 --> 00:44:35.275]  You gotta give these folks a little bit of breathing room in order to provide a little breathing room for millions of American families.
[00:44:35.415 --> 00:44:36.976]  It gave them just a little bit of breathing room.
[00:44:37.117 --> 00:44:38.578]  A little more breathing room.
[00:44:38.718 --> 00:44:40.859]  To give them just a little bit of breathing room.
[00:44:40.879 --> 00:44:43.261]  A little bit of breathing room.
[00:44:43.341 --> 00:44:44.823]  Just a little bit of breathing room.
[00:44:44.843 --> 00:44:47.465]  Everybody's entitled to just a little bit of breathing room.
[00:44:48.365 --> 00:44:49.086]  Just a little bit.
[00:44:50.549 --> 00:44:51.730]  A little bit of breathing room.
[00:44:52.231 --> 00:44:59.298]  You know, my dad used to say, every family needs a little bit of breathing room.
[00:44:59.338 --> 00:45:03.222]  Got your breathing room?
[00:45:03.262 --> 00:45:06.726]  There's Joe Biden, every month of his presidency saying, we're gonna get you a little breathing room.
[00:45:06.746 --> 00:45:07.667]  A little breathing room.
[00:45:07.827 --> 00:45:13.212]  As they raise your taxes, raise the prices, cause inflation, all of it.
[00:45:13.272 --> 00:45:24.243]   Now granted, You can't place the inflation thing just on the Biden administration, but the prices going up, the energy prices going up, that 100% you can.
[00:45:25.644 --> 00:45:26.824]  But that's the real inflation.
[00:45:27.185 --> 00:45:29.405]  It's not the devaluation of the dollar, that's been going on.
[00:45:29.445 --> 00:45:38.569]  The real inflation is the supply chain shortages, the scarcities, the shutting off the oil, shutting off the energy, that's what's caused it.
[00:45:38.889 --> 00:45:41.871]  But Biden wants to give you a little bit of breathing room, folks, as he's choking you.
[00:45:41.891 --> 00:45:45.232]  He's like, I'm just trying to give you breathing room with his hands around your neck shaking you.
[00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:52.252]  Well, we do want to give you some breathing room, or at least some insurance in case of a total collapse.
[00:45:52.792 --> 00:45:56.694]  That's why preparetoday.com was created, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:47:06.965 --> 00:47:10.729]  So that's people going there and some of the more popular packages are already selling out.
[00:47:10.769 --> 00:47:11.670]  But there's still plenty.
[00:47:12.191 --> 00:47:12.992]  It's ready to go.
[00:47:13.112 --> 00:47:16.215]  So these people aren't taking your order on food they don't have.
[00:47:16.255 --> 00:47:17.176]  They have the food.
[00:47:17.236 --> 00:47:19.759]  It's already boxed up and ready to be shipped out.

[00:47:40.127 --> 00:47:42.009]  How are you going to feed your family?

[00:47:49.492 --> 00:48:02.372]  We're joined on the phone line by Savannah Hernandez.
[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:05.723]  She's actually still in the field right now in Washington, D.C.
[00:48:05.743 --> 00:48:11.830]  There's all kinds of craziness going on this weekend in D.C., including yesterday.
[00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:17.256]  A lot of the footage that we played in the first hour was from Savannah Hernandez at the D.C.
[00:48:17.336 --> 00:48:18.637]  Pride March that they had there.
[00:48:18.697 --> 00:48:34.770]   So the man Walking around with his breasts out and his tuck job with his little underwear there, grinding around, humping the ground, in my opinion, assaulting an officer, and all that other footage captured by Savannah Hernandez.
[00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:36.472]  She joins me now on the phone.
[00:48:37.273 --> 00:48:44.257]  So Savannah, you've seen a lot of this activity more and more over the course of your career as a journalist in the field.
[00:48:44.297 --> 00:48:46.938]  Was this maybe the wildest that you've seen here?
[00:48:47.278 --> 00:48:52.721]  The kinks, the puppy play, the drag queens, the men with their breasts out, the children?
[00:48:52.761 --> 00:48:57.704]  I mean, just try to put it all into perspective for us that weren't there.
[00:48:59.164 --> 00:49:10.430]  I think the best way that I can put it in perspective, everything that I witnessed, is I feel spiritually depleted today after seeing everything that happened at our nation's capital.
[00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:20.656]  Again, we had children that were as young as one to two years old that were marching in this parade, and then you had grown men with their breasts out twerking on police officers.
[00:49:21.216 --> 00:49:28.000]  And the crowd cheering the kids on as they marched, the newborn babies that were clad in rainbow gear.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:35.200]   as the parents had them attend this event and watch all of this happen was just insane to me.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.699]  And it took me a while to even digest what I saw.
[00:49:38.699 --> 00:49:43.119]  As a grown adult, having to witness that was horrific.
[00:49:43.119 --> 00:49:48.199]   So I couldn't imagine what it would be like to witness this as a child.
[00:49:48.199 --> 00:49:50.280]  I'm in front of the White House right now as well.
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:54.960]  And we really have been conquered by the LGBTQ community.
[00:49:55.171 --> 00:50:03.119]  The federal building, the Treasury Department, currently has an LGBTQ flag flying alongside the American flag on top.
[00:50:03.579 --> 00:50:04.260]  Which version?
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:05.741]  I mean, there's so many versions now.
[00:50:06.141 --> 00:50:07.542]  Does it have the Ukraine flag in there?
[00:50:07.562 --> 00:50:09.144]  The OG original version.
[00:50:09.184 --> 00:50:10.305]  We don't have the Ukraine flag.
[00:50:10.325 --> 00:50:11.146]  Just the rainbow.
[00:50:11.346 --> 00:50:12.026]  With this one.
[00:50:12.107 --> 00:50:12.907]  Just the rainbow.
[00:50:13.007 --> 00:50:14.569]  Wow, well they need to get with the times.
[00:50:14.589 --> 00:50:15.650]  That's actually bigoted.
[00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:23.475]  That's bigoted against trans and other sexual groups like puppy kinks and stuff, so they should probably change that.
[00:50:25.177 --> 00:50:32.582]  Yeah, and you know, again, it was just so disturbing to have to witness everything and there's still large amounts of the LGBTQ community walking around D.C.
[00:50:32.982 --> 00:50:35.244]  And what happened to public indecency?
[00:50:35.544 --> 00:50:37.705]  Didn't people used to go to jail for that type of thing?
[00:50:37.945 --> 00:50:44.130]  There were people walking around naked in the street or just straight up in their underwear, exposing themselves to children, twerking in the street.
[00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:47.512]  The entire event yesterday smelled like weed.
[00:50:47.652 --> 00:50:49.373]  People were openly drinking in the streets.
[00:50:49.673 --> 00:50:51.634]  It was like a giant block party.
[00:50:51.695 --> 00:50:53.856]  And there's children just playing in the grass.
[00:50:53.978 --> 00:50:58.617]   alongside all of these adults who are essentially crumping each other in the park.
[00:50:58.617 --> 00:51:02.416]   I'm sorry to be vulgar, but that was what was happening during this event.
[00:51:02.416 --> 00:51:07.018]   So again, the only words I can use to describe this are horrific and it really just shows
[00:51:07.018 --> 00:51:09.157]  how much we've degraded as a nation.
[00:51:09.157 --> 00:51:10.856]  We've been conquered by this community.
[00:51:10.856 --> 00:51:12.298]  They're targeting our children.
[00:51:12.298 --> 00:51:13.637]  They say it straight out.
[00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:15.597]  And what are we doing to counter any of this?
[00:51:15.597 --> 00:51:16.438]  Nothing.
[00:51:16.438 --> 00:51:17.258]  We've been conquered.
[00:51:17.258 --> 00:51:18.298]  Their flag is flying everywhere.
[00:51:18.298 --> 00:51:25.538]   Well, that was my point in the first hour was, and it really is it's larger than even that
[00:51:26.121 --> 00:51:35.010]  Any of this activity that we see in the name of gay pride or trans story time or any of this other stuff, in any other circumstances it would be criminal.
[00:51:35.311 --> 00:51:41.838]  In any other circumstances it would be considered indecent, lewd conduct, probably even an arrestable, finable offense.
[00:51:43.042 --> 00:51:43.983]  Here's a perfect example.
[00:51:44.003 --> 00:51:52.867]  The video you shot of the gentleman with his fake breasts out, jumping around, and he goes up and he tries to twerk on a police officer.
[00:51:52.947 --> 00:51:54.728]  I feel so bad for that police officer.
[00:51:54.928 --> 00:52:06.414]  That police officer should have turned around and knocked that guy cold on his butt and arrested him for public indecency and lewd activity in front of a minor and see how he liked that.
[00:52:06.654 --> 00:52:09.456]  But oh, see, so you're allowed to do all this illegal activity.
[00:52:10.456 --> 00:52:13.237]  Lude, misconduct in front of minors, all this other stuff.
[00:52:13.778 --> 00:52:14.938]  Because it's liberal!
[00:52:15.018 --> 00:52:15.898]  It's gay pride!
[00:52:16.199 --> 00:52:18.420]  Any other circumstance, you'd never be allowed to do that.
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:23.722]  But if it's, oh, if it's liberal gay pride, okay, yeah, public indecency, ludeness in front of minors, it's all good.
[00:52:24.873 --> 00:52:25.353]  Exactly.
[00:52:25.373 --> 00:52:27.835]  And they kept spouting, love is love, love is love.
[00:52:27.895 --> 00:52:29.596]  And I said, okay, well, what does that mean?
[00:52:29.616 --> 00:52:32.478]  Because there are hundreds of minors in attendance today.
[00:52:32.858 --> 00:52:44.485]  Again, I think the youngest child that I saw, maybe one or two years old, toddling along, being hyped up by the crowd, holding a little rainbow hand-drawn sign that I'm sure, you know, his parents drew for him.
[00:52:44.505 --> 00:52:46.606]  And again, it's like, oh, love is love.
[00:52:46.746 --> 00:52:48.407]  You just love whoever you love.
[00:52:48.863 --> 00:52:54.768]  And that's what these people are doing, and that's what they're perpetuating in our society, and it's just, it's horrible!
[00:52:54.848 --> 00:53:04.516]  And you know, the best part about that video is that man found my Instagram account and said that I was transphobic for the way that I framed the video.
[00:53:04.556 --> 00:53:14.664]  I said a man with breast, that's apparently transphobia, and because of Instagram, I can't call that out unless I want to get completely deleted off the face of the earth for exposing this type of corruption.
[00:53:15.054 --> 00:53:28.245]  So, um, that's big tech, that's the modern day, and of course we have the mainstream media and every single major corporation in America propping up this same community who has audacity to say that they're oppressed, that they're the ones that are the victim in society.
[00:53:28.265 --> 00:53:29.085]  It's ridiculous.
[00:53:30.286 --> 00:53:37.933]  People have gotten arrested and charged and had their lives ruined in some cases for going behind a dumpster to urinate.
[00:53:38.894 --> 00:53:41.637]  And then they'll get caught, and they'll get fined, they'll get public indecencies.
[00:53:41.777 --> 00:53:44.359]  If there's kids around, they'll get lewdness in front of a minor.
[00:53:44.379 --> 00:53:49.183]  They can put them on a sexual predator list for going to take a leak behind a dumpster in the woods or something.
[00:53:49.564 --> 00:53:53.067]  But, oh, you do it, you're liberal, you're gay, like, then it's okay.
[00:53:53.928 --> 00:53:57.010]  Any other circumstances, this activity would be considered inappropriate.
[00:53:57.030 --> 00:54:07.181]   And here, there's so many different levels of the child abuse, and I don't know if you catch this in real time, but when we're going back and we're watching the footage, You can tell most of the children seem very unhappy at these events.
[00:54:07.261 --> 00:54:08.643]  They seem like they're drugged there.
[00:54:09.024 --> 00:54:11.267]  It seems like their parents are forcing them to do this.
[00:54:11.788 --> 00:54:16.435]  Even that video you talked about where it's that little kid walking with the rainbow up.
[00:54:16.475 --> 00:54:18.418]  You can see the parents have set it up.
[00:54:18.458 --> 00:54:19.800]  It's like a movie shot for them.
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:23.261]  They have him walking there alone, they're walking in front of him and filming like it's a movie shot.
[00:54:23.601 --> 00:54:29.244]  These parents, these adults are just using their kids to virtue signal like, oh look at how great I am as an ally.
[00:54:29.504 --> 00:54:30.784]  I'm sexualizing my kid.
[00:54:30.844 --> 00:54:31.705]  I'm grooming my kid.
[00:54:31.725 --> 00:54:32.685]  Aren't I great as an ally?
[00:54:33.005 --> 00:54:36.426]  Oh look, I'm going to put this on social media and get a bunch of likes and a bunch of shares.
[00:54:38.067 --> 00:54:38.768]  I mean, how many different lines?
[00:54:38.828 --> 00:54:43.011]  Exactly, and you know, the indoctrination and the brainwashing of our youth was so apparent.
[00:54:43.332 --> 00:54:46.454]  I interviewed two young girls, probably 15, 16 years old.
[00:54:46.735 --> 00:54:53.801]  This young girl tells me, oh, well, I'm queer, and then I thought I was pan, then I thought I was bi, and then, you know, now I'm transmasc.
[00:54:54.361 --> 00:55:05.771]  And she just goes through this entire list of all of these fake ideologies and fake sexualities that this community has created and pushed on these young children that just want to feel loved and accepted in life.
[00:55:06.089 --> 00:55:18.677]  And again, because instead of, you know, raising up children in a traditional home, traditional family, they are now being victimized and attacked by this community because a lot of them don't have strong parents who are raising them properly.
[00:55:18.697 --> 00:55:20.679]  So they're latching onto these ideologies.
[00:55:21.019 --> 00:55:21.819]  They're confused.
[00:55:21.879 --> 00:55:22.480]  They're upset.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:26.202]  The LGBTQ community loves to tout how high their suicide rates are.
[00:55:26.502 --> 00:55:27.603]  It's because they're degenerate.
[00:55:27.663 --> 00:55:30.165]  It's because look at the lifestyle that they're promoting.
[00:55:30.185 --> 00:55:31.666]  Look at what they're doing to children.
[00:55:31.926 --> 00:55:32.826]  They can't be happy.
[00:55:32.867 --> 00:55:34.287]  And I could see it in all of their eyes.
[00:55:34.327 --> 00:55:35.048]  They were soulless.
[00:55:35.348 --> 00:55:36.108]  They were sad.
[00:55:36.388 --> 00:55:38.089]  I didn't like being in that environment.
[00:55:38.189 --> 00:55:39.049]  It drained me.
[00:55:39.129 --> 00:55:48.931]  I'm still drained today having to be around these people who are pretending to be happy and pretending that what they're doing is a good thing when in reality they're all mentally ill degenerate.
[00:55:51.091 --> 00:55:54.132]  Yeah and just watching the footage it doesn't look like the children are happy.
[00:55:54.672 --> 00:56:05.368]   It looks like they're forced to be there and Yeah, then they see a dude humping the ground in front of them with fake breasts.
[00:56:05.888 --> 00:56:06.829]  It's a little shocking.
[00:56:06.849 --> 00:56:07.869]  They tend to stare.
[00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:10.471]  That doesn't mean that they like it.
[00:56:11.052 --> 00:56:13.153]  Savannah, where can people see all of your videos?
[00:56:13.173 --> 00:56:15.875]  Because it's impossible for me to even play them in this two-hour show.
[00:56:17.749 --> 00:56:38.281]  People can find my videos on True Social at Sav Says or on my YouTube channel, Sav Says, Instagram at Sav with one N. And again, you know, go share those clips and videos because it's only a matter of time before I'm completely banned again because I will be accused of targeting the LGBTQ community because I'm showing the world what they are doing to children.
[00:56:39.742 --> 00:56:41.342]  Was there any pushback in D.C.
[00:56:41.382 --> 00:56:42.043]  at all yesterday?
[00:56:43.792 --> 00:56:46.014]  Nope, the police were enjoying their time.
[00:56:46.234 --> 00:56:50.719]  And again, I think I was in front of the only police officer who didn't look like he was enjoying it.
[00:56:51.039 --> 00:56:53.441]  But even the fire department was marching in the parade.
[00:56:53.722 --> 00:56:55.824]  Muriel Bowser was marching in the parade.
[00:56:56.184 --> 00:56:58.346]  So the government's fully involved with this.
[00:56:58.686 --> 00:57:04.932]  And like I said, the LGBTQ flag flying alongside the American on the majority of federal buildings here near the White House.
[00:57:06.794 --> 00:57:07.375]  My word.
[00:57:08.146 --> 00:57:09.727]  All right, Savannah Hernandez.
[00:57:10.507 --> 00:57:12.968]  I know it's not fun to have to go and be a part of that stuff.
[00:57:13.008 --> 00:57:14.949]  It's just so toxic, you don't want to be anywhere near it.
[00:57:15.029 --> 00:57:19.492]  But you got the best shots, I would say, from the DC event.
[00:57:19.552 --> 00:57:20.432]  And so we thank you for it.
[00:57:20.452 --> 00:57:21.613]  We thank you for joining us out here.
[00:57:22.213 --> 00:57:24.974]  And stay safe, stay sane out there, Savannah Hernandez.
[00:57:26.095 --> 00:57:26.555]  Thanks, Dad.
[00:57:27.876 --> 00:57:28.396]  All right.
[00:57:29.317 --> 00:57:32.317]  Ladies and gentlemen, believe it or not, we've got more.
[00:57:32.317 --> 00:57:43.436]   Head of drag queen story hour organization arrested for child porn.
[00:57:43.398 --> 00:57:44.578]  And yet another.
[00:57:45.419 --> 00:57:58.363]  How many of these Drag Queen Story Time, Drag Queen Dance Time organization leaders have criminal records, prostitution, drug dealing, solicitation of a minor, child porn possession, all of it?
[00:58:00.084 --> 00:58:02.405]  Can't swing a stick at one of these events without hitting one of them.
[00:58:06.246 --> 00:58:07.807]  We've got more, believe it or not.
[00:58:08.027 --> 00:58:08.808]  We've got more.
[00:58:09.748 --> 00:58:10.729]  Let's check it out now.
[00:58:10.829 --> 00:58:12.230]  We go back to D.C.
[00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:17.513]  where a marcher notices a group of children and says, ooh, children?
[00:58:17.432 --> 00:58:20.271]  I'm gonna really get freaky with it in clip 10.
[00:58:20.271 --> 00:58:26.992]  Oh yeah, that's nice.
[00:58:27.119 --> 00:58:28.460]  Ooh, a group of kids are about to walk by.
[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:30.702]  I'm gonna bend over and show them my ass.
[00:58:32.063 --> 00:58:32.543]  It's liberal!
[00:58:33.584 --> 00:58:33.944]  Oh, okay.
[00:58:36.212 --> 00:58:37.372]  It's liberal, it's gay pride!
[00:58:39.393 --> 00:58:43.254]  Any other time it'd be public indecency, lewd misconduct in front of a minor.
[00:58:43.494 --> 00:58:47.396]  But if it's liberal and gay pride, then we'd love it.
[00:58:51.357 --> 00:58:53.098]  What a deranged time we live in.
[00:58:55.839 --> 00:58:57.839]  What an odd thing.
[00:58:57.839 --> 00:59:01.839]  [Cheering]
[00:59:01.839 --> 00:59:04.839]   What, do they just sit there and scream because they're waving their flags?
[00:59:05.079 --> 00:59:06.300]  What are we cheering on here?
[00:59:08.281 --> 00:59:10.023]  We're celebrating how we're grooming children.
[00:59:10.043 --> 00:59:10.763]  What are you talking about?
[00:59:11.063 --> 00:59:12.304]  Here's more of it, guys.
[00:59:12.324 --> 00:59:13.585]  Let's keep the fun rolling in clip 11.
[00:59:13.765 --> 00:59:21.190]  Oh yeah, let that kid be trans.
[00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:22.511]  Protect trans kids.
[00:59:23.492 --> 00:59:25.891]  Just footage of all the kids they have parading here.
[00:59:25.891 --> 00:59:35.731]  It's just so infuriating.
[00:59:35.862 --> 00:59:37.723]  It's just so despicable.
[00:59:37.743 --> 00:59:43.205]  They just scream and wave their gay flags.
[00:59:44.405 --> 00:59:45.686]  Any of these children seem happy?
[00:59:45.706 --> 00:59:49.408]  Here, let's bring out the strippers.
[00:59:52.409 --> 00:59:53.910]  Let's bring out the youth strippers.
[00:59:53.769 --> 00:59:55.769]  That'll do it.
[00:59:55.769 --> 00:59:57.769]  [crowd cheering]
[00:59:57.769 --> 00:59:59.769]  [crowd cheering]
[00:59:59.769 --> 01:00:03.769]   I'm not seeing many kids that are having that much fun.
[01:00:03.769 --> 01:00:05.769]  [crowd cheering]
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:08.682]  All these children, they don't really seem to be having much fun.
[01:00:10.623 --> 01:00:16.687]  You know, they might like something like, I don't know, maybe like a petting zoo, or maybe like a hayride, or I don't know.
[01:00:17.587 --> 01:00:21.390]  You know, stuff that kids have been doing in America, having fun for decades.
[01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:24.151]  Yeah, here's the child abuse right here.
[01:00:26.092 --> 01:00:26.813]  Oh my gosh.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:37.723]  Here was the interview Savannah Hernandez was talking to, the interview she was talking about in the last segment, where they've got the youth so confused, folks.
[01:00:38.324 --> 01:00:43.746]  When you've got an individual this confused, do you really think they have a shot to be successful and prosperous?
[01:00:43.886 --> 01:00:45.666]  And I'm not trying to be rude to this young girl.
[01:00:45.726 --> 01:00:51.128]  She's just been blasted by psychological weaponry and by sexual weaponry.
[01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:52.529]  And so this is what happens.
[01:00:52.569 --> 01:00:57.951]  Do you think this individual has been well prepared to succeed in the world in Clip 12 by her liberal colleagues?
[01:00:59.984 --> 01:01:00.485]  I'm gay.
[01:01:02.906 --> 01:01:04.426]  What age did you know that you were gay?
[01:01:09.009 --> 01:01:13.831]  I think at like 10, I knew that I... I think at 10, but I wasn't like...
[01:01:14.924 --> 01:01:16.005]  I wasn't clear on my gender.
[01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:27.575]  Yeah, I think it was around like 10 as well when I started questioning if I was bi, and then since then it was kind of like a slippery slope because I kept, I was like, am I bi?
[01:01:27.755 --> 01:01:27.995]  Omni?
[01:01:28.055 --> 01:01:28.536]  Lesbian?
[01:01:28.636 --> 01:01:33.500]  And then I kind of like came to the point, and then now recently I've been like... Now pause it real quick.
[01:01:34.041 --> 01:01:42.261]   These girls seem to be about high school age, young girls here, and They don't know what they're saying.
[01:01:42.321 --> 01:01:43.301]  Oh, maybe I was gay when I was 10.
[01:01:43.341 --> 01:01:44.082]  They don't know what they're saying.
[01:01:44.382 --> 01:01:45.703]  It's all a fad, folks.
[01:01:45.943 --> 01:01:46.723]  It's all a trend.
[01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:49.845]  Think about how many trends and fads you go through when you're a kid.
[01:01:50.906 --> 01:01:53.767]  Think about all the different things that come and go when you're a kid.
[01:01:54.328 --> 01:01:58.190]  One day you're convinced this is who you are, the next day you're convinced this is who they are.
[01:01:58.210 --> 01:02:08.616]  But see, with the sexual stuff, it's all promoted, it's all propagandized, it's all injected, and then it's all enforced and reinforced so that they try to carry it with them forever.
[01:02:10.725 --> 01:02:14.026]  Do you think these people sound like they're prepared to be adults on this planet?
[01:02:14.546 --> 01:02:20.329]  Do you think these two are being prepared to succeed in this world by their liberal indoctrination?
[01:02:20.349 --> 01:02:20.969]  Let's continue.
[01:02:21.689 --> 01:02:22.470]  Like, am I pan?
[01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:29.372]  But then I, like, I think, now I'm starting to realize that I'm queer, but yeah, it was, it started around 10, it wasn't like- So, so, pause it.
[01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:31.213]  What are we talking about?
[01:02:31.233 --> 01:02:34.154]  We're talking about sex, okay?
[01:02:34.374 --> 01:02:35.755]  Let's just, let's be clear here.
[01:02:36.775 --> 01:02:38.376]  We're talking about sex.
[01:02:40.579 --> 01:02:43.120]  How do you know if you're a pansexual or any of the stuff they're talking about?
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:45.601]  What do you like to do?
[01:02:45.621 --> 01:02:49.643]  I mean, do I have to have a biology lesson here?
[01:02:51.604 --> 01:02:54.905]  So, oh yeah, by the age of 10, oh yeah, I liked pansexual.
[01:02:54.965 --> 01:02:58.146]  Folks, I'm not going to sit here and tell you what they claim pansexual to mean.
[01:02:58.686 --> 01:03:00.467]  A 10 year old is not a pansexual.
[01:03:01.207 --> 01:03:02.348]  It's all a fad.
[01:03:04.386 --> 01:03:11.593]  It's all a fad, like, if I'm ten years old, and I watch the Ghostbusters, and I think I'm Dr. Venkman.
[01:03:12.553 --> 01:03:20.481]  And so, you know, I run around with a little outfit I've got on, and a little toy I've got, pretending to vanquish ghosts.
[01:03:21.962 --> 01:03:26.166]  Or I'm playing Star Wars with my friends, and we're building forts in the basement.
[01:03:26.206 --> 01:03:30.530]  We've got little guns and lightsabers, and, ooh, we think we're Star Wars Jedi Knights!
[01:03:32.059 --> 01:03:33.220]  Let's pretend.
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.440]  It's a fad.
[01:03:34.521 --> 01:03:36.682]  I'm not still pretending to be a Jedi.
[01:03:37.242 --> 01:03:39.003]  I'm not still playing with lightsabers.
[01:03:39.704 --> 01:03:40.384]  Or maybe I am.
[01:03:40.444 --> 01:03:40.824]  I don't know.
[01:03:42.405 --> 01:03:48.489]  So the point is, it's kids, and they get shown all this different sexual crap.
[01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:51.031]  So it's not, oh, I'm watching Star Wars.
[01:03:51.051 --> 01:03:51.871]  I think I'm a Jedi.
[01:03:53.192 --> 01:03:54.453]  Oh, I'm watching Ghostbusters.
[01:03:54.493 --> 01:03:55.694]  I think I'm Dr. Venkman.
[01:03:56.894 --> 01:03:57.935]  Or even with sports.
[01:03:58.075 --> 01:03:59.676]  Oh, I'm watching my favorite sports.
[01:03:59.716 --> 01:04:00.997]  I think I'm a basketball player.
[01:04:02.199 --> 01:04:11.021]  No, it's all sex stuff that they get introduced to, and then they see it all over the world around them with all the other propaganda, so it becomes this fad.
[01:04:11.801 --> 01:04:13.761]  But then how do you keep the fad going?
[01:04:14.261 --> 01:04:16.381]  Well, you're constantly changing your sex, see?
[01:04:16.882 --> 01:04:17.922]  You're constantly changing.
[01:04:17.962 --> 01:04:20.142]  So that's how they keep the propaganda going.
[01:04:20.162 --> 01:04:30.664]  They tell the kids, they show them the propaganda, they bring it in as a fad, and then they give them all these different flavors and tastes and colors to kind of change around with, so that they never leave the table.
[01:04:31.044 --> 01:04:32.205]  Here, let's finish this clip.
[01:04:33.245 --> 01:04:34.165]  It started around 10.
[01:04:34.285 --> 01:04:40.588]  It wasn't, like, fully formed, but I guess, like, that's when I realized, wait, that's a possibility?
[01:04:41.268 --> 01:04:41.469]  Yeah.
[01:04:41.869 --> 01:04:44.470]  I am genderqueer, transmasc, and queer.
[01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:45.350]  What's transmasc?
[01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:52.253]  Transmasc is, like, people under the non-binary umbrella identifying, like, or presenting masc.
[01:04:53.314 --> 01:04:53.954]  Masculine?
[01:04:54.174 --> 01:04:54.394]  Yeah.
[01:04:54.494 --> 01:04:55.014]  What about you?
[01:04:55.675 --> 01:05:01.473]   Um, I'm trans and, uh, My sexuality is unlabeled.
[01:05:03.295 --> 01:05:04.356]  I use he-him pronouns.
[01:05:04.677 --> 01:05:05.758]  Yeah, and I use he-they pronouns.
[01:05:06.278 --> 01:05:07.920]  Tell us what you guys identify as.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.642]  We're asking everyone here today.
[01:05:10.183 --> 01:05:14.908]  Gay, cis... What is it?
[01:05:15.288 --> 01:05:16.089]  Cisgender male.
[01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.710]  There we go.
[01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:17.411]  I don't know.
[01:05:19.214 --> 01:05:21.075]  Gender neutral or gender fluid.
[01:05:21.175 --> 01:05:22.055]  I think that's what he said.
[01:05:22.075 --> 01:05:22.375]  I don't know.
[01:05:22.395 --> 01:05:23.075]  I'm confused.
[01:05:23.715 --> 01:05:23.975]  Yeah.
[01:05:24.196 --> 01:05:25.516]  Do you identify as gender fluid?
[01:05:26.276 --> 01:05:26.896]  I don't know.
[01:05:27.316 --> 01:05:29.177]  It's all made up.
[01:05:29.517 --> 01:05:32.938]  I feel like, honestly, honestly, it should not be a bad thing.
[01:05:33.098 --> 01:05:35.398]  Like, I've talked to people who go with they and them.
[01:05:35.418 --> 01:05:40.540]  I'm like, well, in the grammar of things, how would you want to represent yourself?
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:44.501]  I was like, I mean, I guess it because it's like, you're it.
[01:05:44.621 --> 01:05:45.321]  You're the it.
[01:05:46.161 --> 01:05:47.682]  Like, it shouldn't be a bad name.
[01:05:47.762 --> 01:05:49.223]  It should just be... owned.
[01:05:49.943 --> 01:05:50.384]  Gay.
[01:05:51.184 --> 01:05:51.585]  Yes.
[01:05:52.605 --> 01:05:56.568]  Yes, I love it.
[01:05:57.488 --> 01:05:57.889]  She.
[01:05:58.709 --> 01:05:59.690]  Pronouns are he, him.
[01:06:00.070 --> 01:06:03.872]  Sometimes you say... I'm sure these people are going to be smashing successes.
[01:06:04.172 --> 01:06:06.274]  They've all been built for success here.
[01:06:07.835 --> 01:06:09.036]  Hey, what's your experience?
[01:06:09.336 --> 01:06:09.876]  Experience?
[01:06:10.276 --> 01:06:10.677]  I'm gay.
[01:06:11.753 --> 01:06:14.695]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:14.755 --> 01:06:32.345]  Alright, I think we'll be able to cover the rest of it here in this segment, the rest of the videos that we still haven't gotten to, including, I mean, perhaps the most ridiculous, ludicrous, absurd marketing campaign you've ever seen in your life from Postmates.
[01:06:32.665 --> 01:06:35.947]  This one is, uh, oh boy.
[01:06:36.963 --> 01:06:37.243]  Wow.
[01:06:38.044 --> 01:06:40.326]  But let's finish up some of the sights and scenes from the events.
[01:06:40.366 --> 01:06:42.248]  Here's one more from Savannah Hernandez.
[01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:47.973]  Attendees explain why it's a good thing that kids are being groomed at Pride marches.
[01:06:48.974 --> 01:06:51.977]  I notice there's a lot of kids in attendance here this year.
[01:06:52.157 --> 01:06:54.380]  Are there always this many kids and also do you think it's a good thing?
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:07:01.674]   Absolutely and it is a great thing because I feel like Making sure that children are aware of what is around them is important.
[01:07:02.155 --> 01:07:02.855]  Oh, gay sex?
[01:07:03.455 --> 01:07:09.419]  Just because you are around certain things doesn't mean that you're going to be persuaded to be a part of things, but you should be aware... Wow, you're that dumb, huh?
[01:07:09.439 --> 01:07:10.700]  ...of the other types of people that live around you.
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:13.081]  And if you're not capable... Ever heard of nurture?
[01:07:14.362 --> 01:07:17.724]  It's a developmental problem, and this is how... This is a guy in a cheated costume, by the way.
[01:07:17.744 --> 01:07:22.307]  And some of the kids who maybe saw some nudity here, maybe saw some twerking, what do you think about that?
[01:07:22.887 --> 01:07:25.549]  Sometimes when you grow up, you see some nudity.
[01:07:25.909 --> 01:07:26.730]  Do you understand that?
[01:07:27.648 --> 01:07:29.009]  It helps you to understand who you are.
[01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:30.771]  Sometimes you're gonna see some Tarkin.
[01:07:30.851 --> 01:07:32.093]  Um, I absolutely love it.
[01:07:32.113 --> 01:07:33.814]  I work at a Montessori daycare.
[01:07:33.834 --> 01:07:35.776]  Yeah, hit it, pause it, guys.
[01:07:35.796 --> 01:07:37.638]  Yeah, come on, man.
[01:07:37.658 --> 01:07:41.482]  Yeah, every once in a while, a kid's gonna watch a 400-pound dude shake his ass in his face.
[01:07:41.522 --> 01:07:41.863]  Come on, man.
[01:07:42.844 --> 01:07:50.892]  Yeah, you know, a kid walks down the street, sees a guy, sees a guy, you know, doing the old, uh, the old meat cycle there with the old, uh, the old male member.
[01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:54.851]  Kid walking down, gets a little lewd misconduct.
[01:07:55.111 --> 01:07:56.012]  So that's the deal, guys.
[01:07:56.932 --> 01:08:00.774]  Hey, you're, you know, someone tries to hit you for a lewd misconduct, you're taking a leak at a ballgame.
[01:08:00.794 --> 01:08:02.394]  You're saying, whoa, whoa, gay pride, bro!
[01:08:02.794 --> 01:08:03.615]  Gay pride!
[01:08:03.695 --> 01:08:05.295]  Hey, gay pride!
[01:08:05.575 --> 01:08:07.536]  Maybe even have a little rainbow flag with you.
[01:08:07.816 --> 01:08:13.138]  Police starts to approach you to write you a ticket, you're taking a leak, you know, outside of a ballgame or something, behind a dumpster.
[01:08:13.358 --> 01:08:15.359]  You whip out that gay pride flag, start waving it.
[01:08:15.579 --> 01:08:17.140]  Whoa, whoa, buddy.
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:18.701]  You don't want to be a bigot.
[01:08:18.921 --> 01:08:21.304]  You're not going to arrest a gay pride marcher now, are you?
[01:08:21.704 --> 01:08:22.605]  Like, whoa, sir.
[01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:25.108]  I'm sorry, I thought you were just peeing back here.
[01:08:25.368 --> 01:08:29.312]  That would have been sexual lewd misconduct in front of minors that are down the street here.
[01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:31.434]  But I didn't realize this was a gay pride march.
[01:08:31.694 --> 01:08:32.515]  Flaunt away!
[01:08:32.535 --> 01:08:37.820]  Go have a golden... Go to a golden fountain down by the kids if you want to, sir.
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:38.881]  I didn't realize you were gay!
[01:08:39.662 --> 01:08:40.222]  Excuse me.
[01:08:41.843 --> 01:08:42.603]  My bad here.
[01:08:43.343 --> 01:08:45.464]  Thought you were back here trying to take a leak.
[01:08:45.824 --> 01:08:46.725]  That would have been a crime.
[01:08:47.005 --> 01:08:49.586]  But you were back here showing the kids you're Johnson because you're gay?
[01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:51.026]  Right on, brother.
[01:08:51.407 --> 01:08:52.147]  Excuse me.
[01:08:52.267 --> 01:08:52.687]  Pardon me.
[01:08:52.927 --> 01:08:53.547]  Let's continue.
[01:08:55.728 --> 01:09:00.650]  We work at a Montessori daycare and we are very open sexuality based.
[01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:02.671]  Oh, we're open sexually with our kids.
[01:09:02.691 --> 01:09:02.951]  Nice.
[01:09:05.493 --> 01:09:10.414]  Very queer, and it's just a beautiful community, so I'd love to see it here as well.
[01:09:10.434 --> 01:09:12.075]  Guys, this is ridiculous!
[01:09:12.735 --> 01:09:13.515]  Guys, look here.
[01:09:13.535 --> 01:09:14.055]  Alright?
[01:09:15.876 --> 01:09:22.458]  I've got a little, uh... I've got a little... This is a little sound pack.
[01:09:22.478 --> 01:09:23.938]  I don't know what we call these things.
[01:09:23.958 --> 01:09:25.398]  A little sound receiver here, okay?
[01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:26.879]  See this?
[01:09:28.519 --> 01:09:30.540]  This is a binary system that you have here.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:31.740]  Okay?
[01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:33.741]  Here's one end of the system, right here.
[01:09:33.761 --> 01:09:34.641]  Okay?
[01:09:36.127 --> 01:09:36.387]  Right here.
[01:09:36.407 --> 01:09:37.108]  Give me a doc cam.
[01:09:37.168 --> 01:09:39.030]  Let me just explain this to the liberals.
[01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:39.851]  Maybe they don't get this.
[01:09:40.732 --> 01:09:41.453]  Pretty simple stuff.
[01:09:41.493 --> 01:09:43.375]  But liberals, guys, give me a doc cam, okay?
[01:09:43.395 --> 01:09:45.156]  This is a binary system here.
[01:09:45.557 --> 01:09:49.241]  I've got one piece, and I've got a second piece right here.
[01:09:49.261 --> 01:09:50.121]  Okay?
[01:09:50.202 --> 01:09:54.666]  And you notice how this one piece fits into the other piece hole like that.
[01:09:55.367 --> 01:09:55.747]  See that?
[01:09:55.987 --> 01:09:56.788]  Now I've got sound.
[01:09:57.708 --> 01:10:01.054]  Now the technology works!
[01:10:01.956 --> 01:10:08.086]  Now the purpose of the binary system works as intended.
[01:10:09.431 --> 01:10:11.591]  Just like our binary systems.
[01:10:12.231 --> 01:10:13.652]  Is that a good one for you there?
[01:10:14.112 --> 01:10:15.552]  Good little example, do you get it?
[01:10:15.652 --> 01:10:16.972]  It doesn't work any other way.
[01:10:17.232 --> 01:10:25.454]  Yeah, like the airline telling you how gay they are, like, yeah, if I try to plug two of the same parts into one another, guess what?
[01:10:25.774 --> 01:10:28.514]  You're not gonna take off the plane, are ya?
[01:10:31.055 --> 01:10:32.135]  Because it didn't work.
[01:10:36.896 --> 01:10:37.276]  Wow.
[01:10:37.976 --> 01:10:43.570]   So there you go, but Let's continue here with them telling you how great it is that kids are there.
[01:10:44.751 --> 01:10:49.012]  Well, they get the chance to see such a diverse culture.
[01:10:49.072 --> 01:10:54.014]  They get the chance to be open to whatever their body or their mind tells themselves.
[01:10:54.034 --> 01:10:55.275]  What was that?
[01:10:55.335 --> 01:10:57.035]  Hold on, stop it!
[01:10:57.075 --> 01:10:57.896]  Bring it on back.
[01:10:58.916 --> 01:11:00.097]  Wait a second now.
[01:11:00.637 --> 01:11:01.017]  What?
[01:11:02.739 --> 01:11:03.600]  You saw it too.
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.321]  Guys, rewind that one back for me.
[01:11:07.242 --> 01:11:07.642]  I don't know.
[01:11:07.842 --> 01:11:10.402]  We gotta identify whatever that was.
[01:11:10.402 --> 01:11:13.021]  What? Oh my god.
[01:11:13.021 --> 01:11:17.842]  Don't even make me say it.
[01:11:18.628 --> 01:11:19.929]  Is that a dildo tail?
[01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.850]  What the hell?
[01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:25.992]  I mean, that's the thing is I'm watching these images just flash across the screen.
[01:11:26.012 --> 01:11:30.015]  I mean, this person is walking around in a rat tail.
[01:11:31.178 --> 01:11:32.239]  Is that a sex thing?
[01:11:32.259 --> 01:11:34.120]  I don't want to know.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.423]  Here's someone, they got their, they got their partners on leashes.
[01:11:37.483 --> 01:11:39.384]  They got them with like chains and whips.
[01:11:39.524 --> 01:11:40.645]  I mean, what?
[01:11:41.586 --> 01:11:42.807]  Keep it in the bedroom.
[01:11:42.887 --> 01:11:44.348]  Why is that such a big thing?
[01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:46.270]  Keep it in the bedroom.
[01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:50.289]  I don't want to know that you wear a rat tail during sex!
[01:11:50.289 --> 01:11:51.189]  God!
[01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:56.809]  I mean, like...
[01:11:56.809 --> 01:11:58.029]  Oh!
[01:11:58.029 --> 01:11:59.750]  Oh!
[01:12:01.487 --> 01:12:01.627]  Oh!
[01:12:02.688 --> 01:12:03.888]  I get it, alright?
[01:12:03.988 --> 01:12:07.709]  You put your partner on a leash and you drag him around the bedroom, okay?
[01:12:07.789 --> 01:12:08.430]  Keep it there.
[01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:18.873]  I mean, what is the... Guys, if you are seeing what's on the screen, I just... They have, they have, like, dog sex kink parks.
[01:12:20.034 --> 01:12:26.116]  Where sex kink dogs go and pretend they're puppies and play in a little dog park with other puppy plays.
[01:12:28.670 --> 01:12:33.252]  I don't want to know that you wear a rat tail during sex.
[01:12:34.152 --> 01:12:34.713]  Please.
[01:12:35.393 --> 01:12:37.194]  Where do you... Folks, she's wearing that out in public.
[01:12:37.414 --> 01:12:38.674]  Where do you think that's been?
[01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:49.639]  What type of degenerate, disgusting activities has that rat tail been a part of and now she's out wearing it in the streets?
[01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:52.140]  Has that thing been properly cleaned?
[01:12:54.045 --> 01:12:59.148]  Oh, these furries, they like to do their stuff inside their costumes, like that's their whole thing.
[01:12:59.529 --> 01:13:02.510]  They don't even clean those things, they run around hugging children with them.
[01:13:04.692 --> 01:13:10.115]  There was another slide in that video montage where there's like a little boy dry humping a grown man.
[01:13:10.135 --> 01:13:14.018]  I mean, folks, I don't want to see this stuff, I'm sorry.
[01:13:16.359 --> 01:13:20.782]  Oh, the rat tail got me, alright?
[01:13:20.802 --> 01:13:22.003]  The rat tail got me!
[01:13:25.049 --> 01:13:25.729]  You're walking?
[01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:29.251]  I mean, now I'm just... I mean, there's so many questions!
[01:13:31.773 --> 01:13:32.773]  I mean, what are you doing?
[01:13:32.853 --> 01:13:35.475]  You walk into your local sex dungeon?
[01:13:35.515 --> 01:13:36.775]  Yeah, can I get the rat tail?
[01:13:37.936 --> 01:13:44.839]  Yeah, you got one of them... Yeah, you got one of them rat tails I can get.
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:51.423]  Yeah, I was at an orgy last night and I saw someone run around in a rat tail.
[01:13:51.943 --> 01:13:53.144]  It was just really hot to me.
[01:13:54.224 --> 01:13:56.026]  I didn't know if maybe he had some lying around.
[01:13:56.787 --> 01:13:57.748]  What is that?
[01:14:00.010 --> 01:14:01.011]  Oh, it's the doggie tail.
[01:14:02.293 --> 01:14:03.554]  Oh, that's the doggie tail.
[01:14:04.215 --> 01:14:05.016]  Oh, okay.
[01:14:06.499 --> 01:14:10.923]  Yeah, yeah, I saw someone run around in a doggy tail at my local orgy last night.
[01:14:11.263 --> 01:14:16.748]  Yeah, I was getting whipped and beaten, and I noticed somebody ran by with a doggy tail.
[01:14:17.229 --> 01:14:19.911]  So I was thinking maybe I should get myself one of those.
[01:14:20.532 --> 01:14:22.293]  I barely remember it.
[01:14:22.353 --> 01:14:24.415]  Part of my kink is being beaten half to death.
[01:14:25.236 --> 01:14:26.497]  I'm going to teach my kids, too.
[01:14:26.857 --> 01:14:27.278]  It's great.
[01:14:27.858 --> 01:14:29.079]  Oh, just go back to the clip.
[01:14:29.179 --> 01:14:29.660]  I can't even.
[01:14:31.693 --> 01:14:34.453]  Their body or their mind is telling themselves.
[01:14:34.513 --> 01:14:37.514]  They get to learn that at such a young age, and I love that for them.
[01:14:37.594 --> 01:14:50.376]  A lot of people, like, that are claiming to not be homophobic say that, like, they shouldn't get their kids involved, they shouldn't get kids involved with this type of stuff, but I think that, like, it should be, you know, adding little kids to it, it kind of helps normalize pride.
[01:14:50.936 --> 01:14:58.998]  I, like, am so excited for our future because I know that there's going to be a way more open and, like, accepting, and I'm really, like, happy that it exists.
[01:14:59.018 --> 01:14:59.638]  Pause it right there.
[01:14:59.678 --> 01:15:04.331]   See, that's, that, folks, This is really why it's such a threat.
[01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:10.753]  Because we're not talking about building a future of prosperity.
[01:15:10.793 --> 01:15:17.135]  We're not talking about building a future on innovation and technology and expansion and consciousness.
[01:15:17.295 --> 01:15:18.836]  No, it's gay.
[01:15:20.345 --> 01:15:23.669]  What the future's all about, where do I put my private parts?
[01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:26.172]  And how do I use my private parts for pleasure?
[01:15:26.792 --> 01:15:28.134]  And that makes them feel good.
[01:15:28.554 --> 01:15:32.279]  You, a normal person, see civilization collapsing around you.
[01:15:32.719 --> 01:15:38.226]  Them, a demented freak show, says, well, at least we're all gonna be gay and having sex.
[01:15:40.859 --> 01:16:04.156]   Some of the final bits and pieces of our coverage from the Gay Pride parades and marches and the grooming and everything that comes with it here in the last segment today I'm going to show you and then you've got a Houston parent Who brought up a situation at a Houston Independent School District that is not good, that is now going to be investigated.
[01:16:04.616 --> 01:16:06.517]  The Texas Governor has said he's going to investigate.
[01:16:06.537 --> 01:16:09.318]  Looks like some more child grooming going on in the schools there.
[01:16:10.078 --> 01:16:10.999]  So we'll have that for you too.
[01:16:11.039 --> 01:16:16.341]  And then Postmates put out perhaps the most ridiculous marketing campaign you've ever seen.
[01:16:17.081 --> 01:16:19.422]  And we're going to play that clip for you too here as well.
[01:16:19.802 --> 01:16:22.443]  A reminder folks, Harrison Smith taking over after this.

[01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:26.794]  He's got a bunch of news coverage for himself.

[01:17:24.446 --> 01:17:29.328]  Here is some of the last stuff from some of the events from over the weekend.
[01:17:30.148 --> 01:17:33.490]  What they're doing to your children at these drag shows, these pride events.
[01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:33.750]  Clip 14.
[01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:42.827]   And of course it's the Drag queen for kids dancer, leading children in a march.
[01:17:44.407 --> 01:17:45.607]  Very illustrative, isn't it?
[01:17:47.047 --> 01:17:48.828]  Satan leading lambs to the slaughter.
[01:17:50.088 --> 01:17:51.668]  Yes, in many ways indeed.
[01:17:52.347 --> 01:18:01.787]   and quite literally when you talk about the genital mutilation that they recommend for these children and promote for
[01:18:01.787 --> 01:18:09.467]   these children simply incredible
[01:18:09.631 --> 01:18:18.077]  All right, now listen to this Houston parent at, I believe this is either a school board meeting hearing or a city council hearing.
[01:18:18.297 --> 01:18:24.761]  I can't tell, but either way, Governor Abbott has said he is directing the Texas education system to investigate this story.
[01:18:24.781 --> 01:18:30.405]  Houston parent claims one of the teachers takes his kids to an adult drag show.
[01:18:30.445 --> 01:18:31.306]  Here it is in clip 19.
[01:18:33.076 --> 01:18:35.357]  My son attended Sam Houston MSTC.
[01:18:36.917 --> 01:18:41.139]  His teacher, Mr. Patrick Bickler, he was his chemistry teacher.
[01:18:41.339 --> 01:18:45.440]  He was also a writer for About Magazine, an LGBTQ magazine.
[01:18:46.141 --> 01:18:54.644]  He published an article with a lot of students on them without authorization.
[01:18:55.324 --> 01:18:56.324]  He recruited my son.
[01:18:57.725 --> 01:19:00.325]  He also took my son to a drag show when he was underage.
[01:19:03.857 --> 01:19:08.100]  Took him to a drag show when he was underage, and it was really bad.
[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:09.401]  It was a really bad experience.
[01:19:11.263 --> 01:19:16.747]  He also put him next to this sex offender while he was out there with my son.
[01:19:17.768 --> 01:19:20.730]  There's a lot of stuff that nothing got done.
[01:19:23.872 --> 01:19:27.115]  I have a lot of info, a lot of videos, text messages.
[01:19:27.395 --> 01:19:30.017]  Police, HSD has a lot of messages.
[01:19:30.977 --> 01:19:31.478]  It was really bad.
[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:36.440]  And here's some of it.
[01:19:39.621 --> 01:19:40.582]  An eight year old boy.
[01:19:42.042 --> 01:19:43.783]  And so here's here's how it is, folks.
[01:19:44.923 --> 01:19:49.405]  You know, a lot of these drag queen performers might not be the bad guy.
[01:19:50.085 --> 01:19:52.066]  They might be innocent enough just into their thing.
[01:19:52.086 --> 01:19:55.407]  And, you know, they get invited to go do this stuff and they figure it's innocent enough.
[01:19:55.547 --> 01:20:01.950]  But there are those out there that are predators and there are those out there that have friends that are predators.
[01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:13.136]  And so you're just seeing this inappropriate, this adult-themed drag show that an educator took his eight-year-old boy to here on the screen in front of me now.
[01:20:14.017 --> 01:20:19.640]  So the governor has said he's going to investigate this.
[01:20:24.243 --> 01:20:26.425]  So we'll see how that goes.
[01:20:26.465 --> 01:20:27.065]  But that's what they do.
[01:20:29.676 --> 01:20:32.878]  So there's a small percentage of people involved in this that may be innocent enough.
[01:20:32.918 --> 01:20:47.185]  But the people organizing it at the top, they know exactly what they're doing, they know why they're targeting the kids, and then there's always a friend or a colleague that they bring in later on in the process that happens to be a pedophile.
[01:20:48.385 --> 01:20:57.269]   Either convicted multiple times, prostitute, a drug dealer, a child porn distributor, Every single time.
[01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:59.553]  Oh yeah, we're doing Drag Queen for Kids.
[01:20:59.573 --> 01:20:59.893]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:20:59.913 --> 01:21:04.219]  And they bring them all in and then they invite their little friend over who's got that pedophile background.
[01:21:05.561 --> 01:21:06.482]  And it just keeps happening.
[01:21:06.522 --> 01:21:06.643]  Now...
[01:21:08.368 --> 01:21:12.531]  This is Postmates, and I believe Postmates is like a food delivery service.
[01:21:12.791 --> 01:21:13.992]  I've never used Postmates.
[01:21:14.152 --> 01:21:15.052]  Guys, am I right about that?
[01:21:15.453 --> 01:21:19.916]  It's a food delivery service, and it's probably one of the bigger ones, I would imagine.
[01:21:21.697 --> 01:21:22.617]  It's one of the bigger ones.
[01:21:23.218 --> 01:21:24.519]  Probably not after this, though.
[01:21:25.139 --> 01:21:27.541]  This has to be one of the oddest marketing campaigns.
[01:21:27.721 --> 01:21:34.245]  And by the way, they've been very active on their social media accounts with this as well.
[01:21:34.265 --> 01:21:36.567]  Like, here's a post from them.
[01:21:37.878 --> 01:21:41.600]  We're tired of heterosexual sex being the main focus of sexual education.
[01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:48.384]  Homosexual sex, specifically bottoming, is all too often omitted and stigmatized, not this year Happy Pride.
[01:21:48.644 --> 01:21:50.345]  That's because there's nothing biological about that.
[01:21:51.005 --> 01:21:54.627]  Heterosexual sex is the biological reproductive system.
[01:21:54.727 --> 01:21:55.708]  That's why it's taught.
[01:21:56.608 --> 01:21:57.669]  That's what it is.
[01:21:58.610 --> 01:22:04.553]  Sticking your wee-wee in the exit is not biological and nothing to be proud of.
[01:22:07.296 --> 01:22:10.777]  I mean, I'm sorry, man.
[01:22:10.817 --> 01:22:11.858]  I just can't help myself.
[01:22:11.918 --> 01:22:13.618]  I was going to make a really disgusting joke.
[01:22:14.459 --> 01:22:15.279]  But I'm going to withhold.
[01:22:15.299 --> 01:22:16.239]  I'm going to stop.
[01:22:16.859 --> 01:22:25.323]  So here's Postmates letting its users know what foods that they can eat that are good for bottoming, a.k.a.
[01:22:25.643 --> 01:22:26.263]  anal sex.
[01:22:28.664 --> 01:22:29.404]  Eating this pride.
[01:22:30.684 --> 01:22:34.446]  Well, if you're a top, it seems like you can eat whatever you want.
[01:22:35.868 --> 01:22:38.430]  But if you're a bottom, you're expected to starve?
[01:22:39.791 --> 01:22:40.712]  Not this pride.
[01:22:40.992 --> 01:22:41.573]  You know what, guys?
[01:22:41.633 --> 01:22:42.534]  Pause it and restart it.
[01:22:42.714 --> 01:22:44.275]  Because you hear what they say there?
[01:22:44.295 --> 01:22:46.837]  Oh, if you're a top, you can eat whatever you want, but not if you're a bottom.
[01:22:47.158 --> 01:22:51.541]  Let me actually give you the actual science.
[01:22:52.282 --> 01:22:55.064]  If you're not having anal sex, you're good to go.
[01:22:56.706 --> 01:23:00.509]  If no one's sticking it in your exit, you're gonna be quite alright.
[01:23:01.570 --> 01:23:03.872]  So no, it has nothing to do with topping or bottoming.
[01:23:05.535 --> 01:23:11.917]  If you don't want to worry about getting poop on ya, don't have anal sex.
[01:23:13.057 --> 01:23:15.238]  Don't put your wee-wee in the poop hole.
[01:23:15.898 --> 01:23:19.259]  See, they're gonna, oh, oh, it's so unfortunate for bottoms.
[01:23:19.279 --> 01:23:27.961]  They don't know what they can do because, you know, what happens with the... So, uh, we're gonna try to give you guys food that you can eat because you're so discriminated against.
[01:23:27.981 --> 01:23:29.262]  Alright, play it again.
[01:23:29.302 --> 01:23:29.862]  I'll shut up.
[01:23:31.161 --> 01:23:32.782]  What are you eating this pride?
[01:23:32.802 --> 01:23:37.906]  Well, if you're a top, it seems like you can eat whatever you want.
[01:23:37.926 --> 01:23:40.248]  Yeah, if you're not having anal sex, you're good to go.
[01:23:40.588 --> 01:23:41.849]  You're expected to starve?
[01:23:43.231 --> 01:23:44.251]  Not this pride.
[01:23:44.451 --> 01:23:47.354]  Introducing the bottom friendly menu from Postmates.
[01:23:48.875 --> 01:24:02.646]   We teamed up with Dr. Evan Gold Insoluble fiber won't help you feel cute, so avoid things like whole grains, sweet bran, cauliflower, potatoes, legumes.
[01:24:03.407 --> 01:24:03.748]  Hold up!
[01:24:04.028 --> 01:24:05.931]  Are you just fully diving into those beans?
[01:24:08.433 --> 01:24:15.515]  The problem with these foods is they don't dissolve in water, which could cause a traffic jam in your digestive system, making a mess of your evening.
[01:24:16.436 --> 01:24:19.677]  Speaking of messy, it's a good idea to avoid dairy.
[01:24:19.697 --> 01:24:22.298]  I cannot handle lactose right now!
[01:24:22.438 --> 01:24:23.698]  Look at it!
[01:24:24.798 --> 01:24:29.260]  If you're going to eat something insoluble, give your body about 24 hours to process all of it.
[01:24:32.689 --> 01:24:36.513]  Soluble fibers and protein are the key to having some good, clean fun.
[01:24:36.773 --> 01:24:41.198]  These all digest easily and slowly while feeding your... What's that clean fun you're talking about, Postmates?
[01:24:41.378 --> 01:24:42.199]  Why don't you say it?
[01:24:42.219 --> 01:24:42.920]  Why don't you just say it?
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:43.500]  Oh, it's all wrong.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:43.761]  Believe me.
[01:24:43.601 --> 01:24:49.041]   Option why don't you just say it? There's no right or wrong way to bottom, but if you're planning on getting oh, it's
[01:24:49.041 --> 01:24:52.620]   all wrong Believe me the bottom friendly menu on Postmates has the
[01:24:52.620 --> 01:25:03.311]   kinds of foods that could keep you feeling good And then they do all their leftist promotion leftist
[01:25:03.311 --> 01:25:09.681]   promotion at the end of it Oh
[01:25:09.681 --> 01:25:15.986]   *sobbing* I'm sorry, it's just so ridiculous.
[01:25:18.849 --> 01:25:25.473]  We do entire, we do entire ad campaigns for people that are about to go get their butts plugged.
[01:25:28.776 --> 01:25:30.197]  Wow, Biden's America, folks.
[01:25:31.155 --> 01:25:31.735]  Postmates.
[01:25:32.256 --> 01:25:33.797]  How's their stock looking after that?
[01:25:33.977 --> 01:25:35.798]  Do they have stock options?
[01:25:35.858 --> 01:25:37.079]  My guess is it's tanking.
[01:25:37.679 --> 01:25:39.480]  My guess is it's bottoming out.
[01:25:40.401 --> 01:25:40.921]  You know what I mean?
[01:25:41.862 --> 01:25:43.423]  Alright, there you go, folks.
[01:25:43.823 --> 01:25:44.423]  There you go.
[01:25:44.503 --> 01:25:55.970]  If you're worried about keeping your crap in your britches, call Postmates for when your little friend with a rat tail shows up for your orgy.
[01:25:56.491 --> 01:25:57.271]  Alright, liberals.
[01:25:57.371 --> 01:25:57.871]  Gay pride.
[01:25:57.690 --> 01:25:59.690]  It's all fun.
[01:25:59.690 --> 01:26:01.690]  [explosion]
[01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:11.690]   Please, all of you out there watching and listening, remember how many times I've been right.
[01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:15.991]  Remember how many times I told you exactly what was going to happen, and it did happen.
[01:26:16.891 --> 01:26:27.154]  30 months ago, I told you there'd be worldwide food shortages and massive inflation because I was reading what BlackRock and the Bilderberg Group and the Davos Group were actually talking about.
[01:26:27.494 --> 01:26:33.456]  Not in their public statements, but in their policy reports that are public, but not widely distributed.
[01:26:34.176 --> 01:26:40.719]  So the biggest thing you can do now is get high quality, affordable food and it's back in stock, ready to ship right now.
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:45.882]  So write down this URL I'm about to give you and take action and protect yourself and your family.
[01:26:46.182 --> 01:26:49.684]  Don't be dependent on the system with the storm that's coming and it's already here.
[01:26:53.306 --> 01:26:56.827]  PrepareToday.com.
[01:26:56.927 --> 01:27:06.273]   That is one of the most important URLs for your future and the future of your security, and your stability and your independence. Now folks know
[01:27:06.273 --> 01:27:12.634]   for decades I have believed in survival and preparation. I believe we should grow gardens, we
[01:27:12.634 --> 01:27:16.713]   should know how to use firearms, and should know how to fix electrical systems, you name it.
[01:27:16.713 --> 01:27:20.453]   Because going into the future, if the globalists have their way, and they now are during
[01:27:20.453 --> 01:27:26.284]   the great reset, most of the major infrastructure is going to be slowly shut down. So we've
[01:27:26.284 --> 01:27:27.913]  got to get ahead of that curve.
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:31.543]  Now, storable food is always a must-have.
[01:27:32.083 --> 01:27:42.191]  There's a lot of fly-by-night companies out there, but I've always gone out and found the very best sponsors and the very best products to bring to you, the very products that I've researched, that I use.
[01:27:42.631 --> 01:28:07.266]   And instead of just going to InfoWareStore.com, which still has the products linked on it, we have created with some great Partners prepare today.com so it's a one-stop shop not just of the highest quality storable food with the largest selections but also hundreds and hundreds of great survival and preparedness items the lowest prices you're going to find anywhere and then it also sponsors info wars
[01:28:07.454 --> 01:28:12.173]   and keeps the First Amendment and the fight against the New World Order going, so it's a 360 win.
[01:28:12.173 --> 01:28:19.373]   Now you can also follow preparewithalex.com and that URL now points at preparetoday.com.
[01:28:19.373 --> 01:28:26.734]   All of you that in the last 30 months went out and bought storable food, made such a great decision.
[01:28:26.959 --> 01:28:29.260]  Food prices are up over 30% in the U.S.
[01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:32.502]  and even higher in other parts of the world, and they're only going up.
[01:28:32.922 --> 01:28:33.883]  That's not a safe bet.
[01:28:34.023 --> 01:28:35.224]  That is a guaranteed.
[01:28:35.844 --> 01:28:40.227]  The central banks of the world have done this by design to bring the people to their knees.
[01:28:40.267 --> 01:28:46.891]  So when I told people at the beginning of the COVID lockdowns that it was going to cause worldwide food shortages and collapse, we were right.
[01:28:47.211 --> 01:28:51.334]  And those of you that bought storable food in the last few years have saved a lot of money.
[01:28:52.014 --> 01:28:55.697]  I would get involved now and get your storable food taken care of and other preparedness items.
[01:28:56.137 --> 01:28:59.659]  PrepareToday.com while you still can and keep it before it's on the air.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.581]  PrepareToday.com.
[01:29:01.941 --> 01:29:04.743]  Don't procrastinate, don't wait, don't be dependent on the system.
