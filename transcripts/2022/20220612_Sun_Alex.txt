[00:00.000 --> 00:17.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:17.000 --> 00:24.520]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones and now your
[00:24.520 --> 00:40.240]  host Owen Troyer. Unfortunately for the second straight weekend I'm gonna be
[00:40.240 --> 00:50.560]  having to cover the perverts and the deranged demented activity at the hands
[00:50.560 --> 01:00.320]  of the LGBTQ plus pride month brigade which is really too sad for rational
[01:00.320 --> 01:07.440]  normal gay people or queer people out there whatever it is they don't want to
[01:07.440 --> 01:10.120]  be involved with this don't want to be involved with child abuse don't want to
[01:10.120 --> 01:13.400]  be involved with all the propaganda don't want to be involved in the culture
[01:13.400 --> 01:17.920]  wars just want to do their own thing and be left alone like everyone else but
[01:17.920 --> 01:25.440]  no they're gonna use you to groom and indoctrinate children so that their
[01:25.440 --> 01:32.360]  identity growing up is all based on their sexual whatever's that have now
[01:32.360 --> 01:41.960]  been injected into their minds the different ideas instead of principles
[01:41.960 --> 01:54.440]  like courage or integrity or honesty or bravery family loyalty hard work no it's
[01:54.440 --> 02:06.680]  gonna be all about what sex you are and you got to ask yourself how is gay
[02:06.680 --> 02:13.200]  pride month now the second maybe the biggest thing in this country and you
[02:13.200 --> 02:18.360]  might say well what are you talking about I doubt there is as much government
[02:18.360 --> 02:23.000]  spending and organizing and everything that goes into these events I was
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.440]  thinking the only thing that comes closest maybe Christmas folks there are
[02:27.440 --> 02:36.040]  hundreds of gay pride parades hundreds and look at the size of these things
[02:36.040 --> 02:45.880]  look at all the corporate sponsors now so I literally have hours and hours of
[02:45.880 --> 02:48.120]  this from over the weekend so I'm gonna come back and let you know what's
[02:48.120 --> 02:55.680]  going on but I mean quickly though on the political side of the spectrum Joe
[02:55.680 --> 03:02.360]  Biden is an absolute political disaster his approval rating is quickly heading
[03:02.360 --> 03:08.280]  into the 20s historic lows we're talking Congress already crossed that
[03:08.280 --> 03:16.120]  threshold long ago so the government isn't just an abysmal failure everyone
[03:16.120 --> 03:21.960]  is seeing their gas prices go up their energy prices go up their grocery bills
[03:21.960 --> 03:30.400]  go up probably their paychecks go down because their taxes are also going up and
[03:30.400 --> 03:37.240]  no matter how much the Democrats try to blame Putin or blame January 6th or
[03:37.240 --> 03:41.640]  keep playing the blame game it's not sticking anywhere it's like the old
[03:41.640 --> 03:47.240]  saying I am rubber you are glue whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you
[03:47.240 --> 03:55.160]  that's the Democrats right now and and even with January 6th and even with
[03:55.160 --> 04:00.680]  January 6th they're not changing any minds in fact neutral or inquiring minds
[04:00.680 --> 04:05.680]  are saying why are they still bringing this up and if you knew this was gonna
[04:05.680 --> 04:13.160]  go down why did you turn down the National Guard and why did you turn down
[04:13.160 --> 04:20.240]  having extra police on the scene that day this isn't adding up and this doesn't
[04:20.240 --> 04:25.360]  affect me anyway at least that's how they view it a political witch hunt the
[04:25.360 --> 04:29.640]  Democrat Party weaponizing the government against its opposition does
[04:29.640 --> 04:32.640]  affect all of us but a lot of people won't understand that but they do
[04:32.640 --> 04:36.800]  understand their gas bill going up and their electric bill going up and their
[04:36.800 --> 04:42.760]  grocery bill going up and their kids coming home from school with sexual
[04:42.760 --> 04:49.520]  propaganda and racial propaganda and no no amount of blame gaming by the
[04:49.520 --> 04:54.960]  Democrats and Biden can fix the damage that the Democrats have done to this
[04:54.960 --> 05:04.360]  country and themselves a lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find out of
[05:04.360 --> 05:08.400]  the thousands of great items and enforced or calm all the storeable food so

[07:11.280 --> 07:18.360]  children into accepting caring so buckle up ladies and gentlemen on this Sunday
[07:18.360 --> 07:26.560]  June 12th and let me just give you a fair warning I just I don't even know
[07:26.560 --> 07:32.960]  how to properly explain what it is we're about to show you today because here's
[07:32.960 --> 07:40.680]  the deal I'm gonna tell you the serious nature of it all and I mean you're gonna
[07:40.680 --> 07:46.360]  see some of this stuff and it's gonna make you nauseous and sickened but I
[07:46.360 --> 07:52.200]  mean folks you gotta understand we're only human here at this crew here at
[07:52.200 --> 07:59.520]  Infowars and I mean some of this stuff is just belly laughter worthy okay I mean
[07:59.520 --> 08:06.040]  when you've got when you've got linebacker looking you know NFL athlete dudes
[08:06.040 --> 08:11.960]  dressed up as leather daddies dancing to Beyonce grinding for children and see
[08:11.960 --> 08:15.880]  and that's where it gets ridiculous is the aspect of the children and so that's
[08:15.880 --> 08:19.880]  when you start to get nauseous and sickened by this but it's just I mean
[08:19.880 --> 08:25.680]  there's just so many different levels of ridiculousness to what's going on now I
[08:25.680 --> 08:30.120]  mean look at that big fat Cleveland steamer coming at you yeah look at that
[08:30.120 --> 08:36.320]  big old daddy dump truck slaps his butt shakes it for the children I mean folks
[08:36.320 --> 08:40.600]  this is this was happening all weekend long again so here's the fair warning if
[08:40.600 --> 08:44.200]  you don't want to watch this stuff I don't blame you okay I don't want to
[08:44.200 --> 08:49.760]  watch this stuff I went to one of these events here in Austin yesterday I was
[08:49.760 --> 08:56.240]  there for about an hour I saw he on say perform I mean folks it'd be like if I
[08:56.240 --> 09:01.160]  got into you know a brawn panties and said I was Shakira okay I mean it's just
[09:01.160 --> 09:06.480]  but it's he on say probably better than the real thing since it's a dude since
[09:06.480 --> 09:09.920]  men do everything better than women now men are even better at being women than
[09:09.920 --> 09:14.960]  women so I saw he on say yesterday better than the real deal better than the
[09:14.960 --> 09:18.480]  real thing there there you go there's some of the stuff that we're gonna be
[09:18.480 --> 09:23.000]  showing you coming up on the transmission today so I don't blame you if
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.960]  you don't want to see it I don't blame you if you're tuned out I understand if
[09:26.960 --> 09:30.640]  you're even like why do you even show this stuff because folks nobody else is
[09:30.640 --> 09:37.240]  covering it and and it's all oriented to children it's it that that's the
[09:37.240 --> 09:40.040]  driving force and if you guys go to the end of the video I uploaded yesterday
[09:40.040 --> 09:44.040]  you'll see he on stage performance I was getting down I was getting down to some
[09:44.040 --> 09:51.240]  he on say oh yeah and you can see Taylor Hanson and a couple other friends of the
[09:51.240 --> 09:55.960]  show were out there and they stuck it out those troopers stuck it out they
[09:55.960 --> 10:00.720]  were there all evening they had to see about 30 different gay drag show for
[10:00.720 --> 10:08.680]  kids events and I didn't I had to he on say was it for me I said once I've seen
[10:08.680 --> 10:13.640]  it hi he on say I think I've seen them all and you really can't you know that's
[10:13.640 --> 10:17.800]  just that's just the one for me that was it I saw he on say said it's better than
[10:17.800 --> 10:24.160]  Beyonce I'm done but so it'd be one thing if I wanted to come in here now I
[10:24.160 --> 10:27.080]  mean look I'm gonna laugh I'm not gonna lie I mean some of this stuff is
[10:27.080 --> 10:31.680]  ridiculous I mean 350 pound dudes and leotards you know humping the humping the
[10:31.680 --> 10:37.000]  ground for children I mean and there's a level of humor in that you know so
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.160]  there's a level of wow these are perverts this is grooming children and
[10:40.160 --> 10:44.360]  then there's just I gotta I mean I don't want to go completely crazy let's at
[10:44.360 --> 10:49.360]  least let's at least look at the humorous aspect of this but even I feel
[10:49.360 --> 10:53.720]  dirty doing that even I feel dirty doing that because this is child abuse on a
[10:53.720 --> 10:59.600]  mass scale with the guys with the mask with the veil of liberalism and
[10:59.600 --> 11:07.120]  tolerance and gay pride you can have all that stuff without the child abuse
[11:07.120 --> 11:14.320]  thank you very much but they can't why can't they because that's what it was
[11:14.320 --> 11:23.000]  always about it was always about perverts and groomers having a sexual
[11:23.000 --> 11:29.560]  revolution that once they get the children involved they can come out of
[11:29.560 --> 11:34.760]  the closet as minor attracted people formerly called pedophiles and then
[11:34.760 --> 11:41.440]  they've blurred all the lines of morals and sex which of course they don't
[11:41.440 --> 11:46.000]  believe in creation they just think we're a bunch of randomized cells so
[11:46.000 --> 11:51.160]  yeah just go out there and stick it wherever you can that's that's their
[11:51.160 --> 11:55.120]  sexual revolution and then it's your sexual identity of ooh what do you stick
[11:55.120 --> 12:02.360]  it in or what do you stick inside of it and then here's the flag for you you
[12:02.360 --> 12:05.200]  don't have a nation's flag anymore you don't have a you don't have a sovereign
[12:05.200 --> 12:11.000]  nation-state you're from that your forefathers help build no no no you've
[12:11.000 --> 12:17.680]  got a hey where do I stick my pee pee or wee wee and you here's my flag because
[12:17.680 --> 12:25.200]  I live in the global government now and my identity is of is my sex and so again
[12:25.200 --> 12:30.440]  I'm just rolling the b-roll here I'm gonna come down and go down the list got
[12:30.440 --> 12:33.400]  about 15 of these videos I'm gonna go down the list when I come back in the

[20:28.560 --> 20:33.840]  upset these are just all the family friendly events for kids over the weekend
[20:33.840 --> 20:41.680]  here you're seeing on the screen oh yes four children all the different kinks
[20:41.680 --> 20:49.160]  can be explored by your kids down thanks to the left liberals democrats not a
[20:49.160 --> 20:54.440]  kink they won't tell your child about and show for them to as this was
[20:54.440 --> 21:01.920]  happening all over the country this weekend and I I I'm really at a loss
[21:01.920 --> 21:09.880]  wrapping my head around the fact that because I'm trying to argue myself out
[21:09.880 --> 21:20.040]  of this conclusion but more time and effort and corporate sponsorship go into
[21:20.040 --> 21:26.280]  gay pride month than even Christmas now because I was thinking about that when I
[21:26.280 --> 21:33.120]  went to the gay pride event for families for kids yesterday here in downtown
[21:33.120 --> 21:36.080]  Austin I was there for about an hour during the day did some filming with
[21:36.080 --> 21:39.400]  Taylor Hansen and others the videos up on the war room channel there's some
[21:39.400 --> 21:44.080]  funny stuff there I saw he on safe performance better than Beyonce folks
[21:44.080 --> 21:47.480]  you can't even imagine you know men are better women than women now so thank
[21:47.480 --> 21:54.160]  that's that's modern-day feminism men can be women and they're better at it so it
[21:54.160 --> 21:58.080]  was really just some mild stuff when I was there there wasn't much going on
[21:58.080 --> 22:01.280]  there wasn't much in attendance but later on then I got pretty wild and we got
[22:01.280 --> 22:07.560]  some footage but how how do I wrap my head around the fact that I mean it's
[22:07.560 --> 22:14.360]  just true gay pride month is now a bigger corporate event national event
[22:14.360 --> 22:19.720]  than Christmas even here in Austin we do some stuff for Christmas we got a
[22:19.720 --> 22:22.720]  little park we put a little big Christmas tree up we do some Christmas lights
[22:22.720 --> 22:25.880]  you know we got a little Christmas stuff might happen you might even have a
[22:25.880 --> 22:32.600]  little Christmas parade and stuff down at the park 4th of July we do fireworks
[22:32.600 --> 22:37.680]  got a big band that shows up place the national anthem all kinds of festivities
[22:37.680 --> 22:43.320]  Christmas thing lasts about three weeks maybe four July 4th stuff usually does
[22:43.320 --> 22:47.200]  you know it's that weekend and then of course on July 4th but I mean this is
[22:47.200 --> 22:56.080]  the whole month every weekend every weekend in multiple areas huge pride
[22:56.080 --> 23:00.360]  events and look there's your puppy kink and all the little puppy kinks come out
[23:00.360 --> 23:06.360]  and they have their little puppy kinks on their on their strollers and on their
[23:06.360 --> 23:11.880]  leashes and with their their doggy masks on and they go up and they pretend
[23:11.880 --> 23:17.240]  they're little doggies and they have the kids pet them hey look at least they was
[23:17.240 --> 23:20.120]  there was one drag queen story time over the weekend they've pretty much
[23:20.120 --> 23:25.040]  eliminated the story time so how do I how do I wrap my head around that fact
[23:25.040 --> 23:28.880]  I'm I'm still in denial of it so let's just start showing you some of this
[23:28.880 --> 23:33.560]  footage this is a lot of this is from Savannah Hernandez who joins us in the
[23:33.560 --> 23:39.480]  next hour she's still in DC covering some of the madness is going on there let's
[23:39.480 --> 23:44.200]  start this is clip one this is the pride parade in DC and they're marching right
[23:44.200 --> 23:50.200]  down through DC and they've got a nice transgender man the Ted breast surgery so
[23:50.200 --> 23:56.120]  three bulges and this guy's clothes and and he's going around topless and to me
[23:56.120 --> 24:00.040]  what he does to this police officer is assault the police sexual assault the
[24:00.040 --> 24:03.160]  police officer to should arrest this individual immediately but oh it's
[24:03.160 --> 24:07.160]  liberal oh it's gay oh it's pride month so you're allowed to get away with sexual
[24:07.160 --> 24:11.960]  assault in the name of pride month now here it is in clip one
[24:18.080 --> 24:25.000]  this is a transsexual man walking around breasts out and then goes up to a
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.080]  police officer to grind on a police officer backing into him tell me that
[24:29.080 --> 24:36.680]  that's not a tell me that should not be assault are you kidding me you you go up
[24:36.680 --> 24:43.040]  to some random person in the street and you put your ass into them and you shake
[24:43.040 --> 24:48.320]  it in the air that is that is at the very least lewd there there is lewd
[24:48.320 --> 24:53.960]  conduct charges there that is that is absurd and I feel bad for that police
[24:53.960 --> 24:58.400]  officer that has to be embarrassed like that what what a what a what an
[24:58.400 --> 25:02.080]  embarrassing thing to stand there you're trying to work as a police officer you're
[25:02.080 --> 25:04.440]  actually trying to protect these people you may not even agree with them
[25:04.440 --> 25:08.160]  disagree with them who knows and you understand they're at this event and
[25:08.160 --> 25:13.320]  some pervert some dude that decides to get breast implants comes up and tries
[25:13.320 --> 25:18.160]  to shake his ass on you I wish he would have thrown that dude to the ground and
[25:18.160 --> 25:24.040]  arrested him and taken him in right there for lewd misconduct in public
[25:24.040 --> 25:32.560]  because that's what that is and that's what all of this is see this is what
[25:32.560 --> 25:36.240]  liberalism has done this is what the democrat party has done but this is the
[25:36.240 --> 25:45.120]  culture of liberalism well beyond gay pride folks has very little to do with
[25:45.120 --> 25:51.400]  gay pride in fact that is that that should people have their lives ruined
[25:51.400 --> 25:57.240]  people have had their lives ruined because they step into the woods at a
[25:57.240 --> 26:03.960]  ballgame to take a pee and some and some parent calls the cops and says that
[26:03.960 --> 26:09.400]  man's urinating in the woods and they end up getting a lewd misconduct in
[26:09.400 --> 26:12.240]  front of in front of minor's charges because there's kids playing soccer at
[26:12.240 --> 26:17.560]  the park he goes back to the woods to take a to take a leak okay that goes on
[26:17.560 --> 26:25.320]  that that that happens you can say that's good or bad that that goes on and
[26:25.320 --> 26:31.040]  okay that'll deter people from peeing at public events for sure or peeing in
[26:31.040 --> 26:36.540]  public you get one lewd misconduct charge that'll stop people from peeing in
[26:36.540 --> 26:39.800]  public you know are you that's legitimate or not I'm saying that goes on but
[26:39.800 --> 26:45.720]  oh you're at a gay kink event oh you're at a gay pride parade oh you're a
[26:45.720 --> 26:53.960]  liberal and so now all of a sudden you can walk around naked grinding on people
[26:53.960 --> 27:01.280]  how is that not lewd misconduct in front of minors you're you're walking around
[27:01.280 --> 27:07.160]  you claim to be a woman you're walking around in the fog with a with a you got
[27:07.160 --> 27:12.920]  the old tuck job going on and you've got your your fake breasts out shaking them
[27:12.920 --> 27:17.760]  and you go up to a police officer and you try to grind your ass on him you
[27:17.760 --> 27:22.560]  should have been arrested on the spot and I feel on my heart breaks for that
[27:22.560 --> 27:30.840]  police officer that has to deal with that embarrassment that is just
[27:30.840 --> 27:49.640]  disgusting oh here we go guys let's show them the puppy play gear guys we're

[30:05.520 --> 30:10.400]  by the corporate media by the controlled churches and universities why is this a
[30:10.400 --> 30:15.840]  case because we innately by God have been given the keys for our own minds
[30:15.840 --> 30:19.800]  our own side he's our own souls and by connecting to God we can empower
[30:19.800 --> 30:26.240]  ourselves and trend send the quote fallen or sinful state so the chemicals
[30:26.240 --> 30:30.680]  that we ingest and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to change
[30:30.680 --> 30:35.320]  who we are are only lowering us they're only making this for the press and the
[30:35.320 --> 30:39.880]  end they're only making us less filled it is only by going within and really
[30:39.880 --> 30:43.600]  making that connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves that's why
[30:43.600 --> 30:47.920]  the globals bombard us with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal
[30:47.920 --> 30:52.480]  vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be
[30:52.480 --> 30:56.240]  able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension and that's what the
[30:56.240 --> 31:01.760]  incredible products you know it's going back to what we all thought was going to
[31:01.760 --> 31:05.640]  happen in the 90s when the internet and mobile technology first came out which
[31:05.640 --> 31:08.440]  is we thought you know this is going to level the playing field everybody's
[31:08.440 --> 31:10.840]  gonna have access to the same information everybody's gonna be able to
[31:10.840 --> 31:15.560]  freely communicate that information that's our goal to get back to that
[31:15.560 --> 31:20.080]  place where we all have access to all of the information we all have the
[31:20.080 --> 31:23.720]  ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want
[31:23.720 --> 31:28.520]  whenever we want and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're
[31:28.520 --> 31:33.520]  doing and trying to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to
[31:33.520 --> 31:38.160]  go after us because of the conversations we're having because of the internet
[31:38.160 --> 31:42.600]  searches that we're doing because of the discussions the people we want to talk
[31:42.600 --> 31:46.840]  to about these things so that's our goal is to help people take back their
[31:46.840 --> 31:50.280]  freedom by helping them to take back their privacy and so that's really what
[31:50.280 --> 31:55.200]  we're trying to do and so I hope that everybody listening we'll check us out

[41:30.760 --> 41:36.320]  pretty good job there's a bit of a problem they're having because they the
[41:36.320 --> 41:39.440]  whole thing is really confusing the layout and they got construction on
[41:39.440 --> 41:42.800]  multiple ends so like there's no street access to it so it's hard to even get in
[41:42.800 --> 41:48.080]  the thing but I mean you know it's a nice little concert venue they have there
[41:48.080 --> 41:53.440]  and I know and I'm leaving yesterday and I and I know that people have a
[41:53.440 --> 41:55.920]  hard time finding it because I've been to this venue before and I can tell people
[41:55.920 --> 42:01.720]  are kind of walking around confused and they can see that I had come from the
[42:01.720 --> 42:04.920]  event and they and people start asking me they're like hey where how do you get

[47:46.200 --> 47:55.240]  pervert not a sexual deviant I mean what talk about illustrative a sexual
[47:55.240 --> 48:03.800]  deviant leading a bunch of children around a parade our coverage continues
[48:03.800 --> 48:09.080]  from the madness over the weekend I'm sorry that for the second straight
[48:09.080 --> 48:15.720]  weekend my theme for the transmission is how the perverts are grooming your
[48:15.720 --> 48:19.920]  children but no one else is really warning you about it nobody else is
[48:19.920 --> 48:25.640]  really putting a light on these cockroaches so we'll continue to do just
[48:25.640 --> 48:32.160]  that here is more from Taylor Hansen he was at the drag queen for kids show the
[48:32.160 --> 48:36.960]  pride event here in Austin Texas and this is yet another drag queen going
[48:36.960 --> 48:50.560]  into the crowd and getting right up in the children's faces and clip six what
[48:50.560 --> 48:54.120]  is the purpose of this even yeah there's the kiddos yeah get right into those
[48:54.120 --> 49:00.120]  kids yeah notice spots the kids from the stage and then goes right down in front
[49:00.120 --> 49:10.760]  of the children I'm sure that wasn't the plan just happened that way hey let's
[49:10.760 --> 49:14.240]  just play music let's just play some 80s music or something or some 60s just
[49:14.240 --> 49:19.200]  you know let's just put a let's put a man in drag called for kids that's
[49:19.200 --> 49:26.200]  good entertainment it's like again they have a whole month of this crap all the
[49:26.200 --> 49:30.440]  corporate sponsorship all the big events it's bigger than Christmas now they can
[49:30.440 --> 49:33.280]  just had a normal day they just could have I mean why not adventure time for
[49:33.280 --> 49:36.920]  kids discovery time for kids learning time for kids music time for kids like
[49:36.920 --> 49:39.960]  anything anything innocent anything normal they could have taken all the
[49:39.960 --> 49:43.760]  funding they could have had great bands playing they could have they could have
[49:43.760 --> 49:47.400]  little Disney performances of their favorite movies and stuff like that
[49:47.400 --> 49:52.240]  mascots running around they could have done you know normal stuff we could have
[49:52.240 --> 49:57.160]  spent the millions on normal activities for kids and and wholesome activities and
[49:57.160 --> 50:01.720]  actual family-friendly stuff and actually I'm learning experience no because
[50:01.720 --> 50:06.520]  it's all about sexually grooming the children so we disguise it as a family
[50:06.520 --> 50:11.480]  friendly thing but we all know what's really going on it's not about the kids
[50:11.480 --> 50:18.360]  it's not about having fun with the kids it's about us it's about us sexualizing
[50:18.360 --> 50:21.760]  the kids that's what it's really about it's not about the kids having fun it's
[50:21.760 --> 50:28.360]  about us subjugating the kids because we're leftists we're liberals we're
[50:28.360 --> 50:32.560]  Democrats we need to subjugate things we need subjects the kids are our
[50:32.560 --> 50:37.960]  subjects but imagine all the fanfare they have that big beautiful park there's
[50:37.960 --> 50:41.680]  a little park there too a little playground all those booze and everything
[50:41.680 --> 50:46.760]  they could have done an event that that would have actually been awesome for
[50:46.760 --> 50:54.120]  kids but instead they use it to groom and sexualize and indoctrinate them kids
[50:54.120 --> 50:59.120]  don't know whether they're having fun or not they don't know what's going on they
[50:59.120 --> 51:02.420]  just see a dude coming up to them dancing around singing laughing and they're
[51:02.420 --> 51:07.360]  so okay I guess I'm having fun now daddy says it's okay for this person to be
[51:07.360 --> 51:14.000]  touching me I mean what is this folks you're just singing on the screen it's
[51:14.000 --> 51:18.680]  just it's out of control but I mean imagine imagine they actually like had
[51:18.680 --> 51:22.800]  a fair maybe a poll I don't know put up a ferris wheel or something I mean God
[51:22.800 --> 51:32.600]  forbid no it's all it's all got to be gay activities all month long not carnival

[54:58.240 --> 55:04.320]  little girl the little kid or the parents it's all about them it's always all
[55:04.320 --> 55:09.560]  about them it's what I mean I look I can sit here and I go go down the list of
[55:09.560 --> 55:13.720]  negative characteristic and character traits and personal traits and it's it's
[55:13.720 --> 55:16.960]  a liberal that possesses all of them that's just more proof right there the
[55:16.960 --> 55:20.040]  selfishness but again just more proof they're showing the images the kids are
[55:20.040 --> 55:24.920]  having fun at these things the kids don't want to be there they're forced to go
[55:24.920 --> 55:28.480]  there and it's all the adults that are the ones having funds and they just
[55:28.480 --> 55:31.200]  pretend it's for kids because they're grooming the kids because they have they
[55:31.200 --> 55:36.040]  have a level of sexual perversion and and and deviant in them I think that's
[55:36.040 --> 55:40.400]  pretty obvious at this point but hey if that little girl was maybe on a fairy
[55:40.400 --> 55:45.680]  like a ferris wheel or something or a merry-go-round maybe pet naponi you know
[55:45.680 --> 55:49.400]  you think she'd be having fun or maybe there was a performer singing like one
[55:49.400 --> 55:52.480]  of her favorite Disney songs like from frozen or something like that you think
[55:52.480 --> 55:55.720]  she'd be having fun then yeah because that's what kids like and that's what
[55:55.720 --> 55:59.440]  kids have always liked but see we're not we're not having this event for the
[55:59.440 --> 56:03.080]  children are we no we're having this event for all the adults and we're just
[56:03.080 --> 56:07.920]  pretending it's for the children when really it's just all for the for the the
[56:07.920 --> 56:14.080]  gay selfish needs of the adults that also have an agenda to groom the children
[56:14.080 --> 56:17.640]  they brag about it here's another one guys let's go to the drag queen here
[56:17.640 --> 56:21.720]  dancing and doing the splits just shaking that stuff for the kids in clip
[56:21.720 --> 56:29.920]  8 oh yeah here comes big daddy dump truck
[56:30.080 --> 56:39.120]  yeah for kids I mean are you kidding me

[57:03.800 --> 57:09.200]  right there literally humping dry humping the ground right in front of children
[57:09.200 --> 57:17.200]  spreading his legs like a stripper for kids guys it's all for kids though okay
[57:17.200 --> 57:22.360]  well that was fun oh and I've only gotten through half of the list so I've
[57:22.360 --> 57:27.040]  got more coming up here folks no one else is covering this stuff I don't blame
[57:27.040 --> 57:30.880]  quite frankly but we're gonna warn you we're gonna warn you the liberals are

[57:34.440 --> 57:40.080]  coming with some of the most perverted deviant stuff that you have ever seen
[57:40.080 --> 57:48.720]  and we haven't even had enough time in this hour to cover it sadly more coming
[57:48.720 --> 57:53.480]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer
[57:53.480 --> 57:57.480]  or answer a doctor a lawyer or a millionaire fortune and money magazine

[58:01.680 --> 58:05.760]  different answers 50 different tax returns 50 different answers and almost
[58:05.760 --> 58:10.040]  all of them just screw you over especially the big firms and the big
[58:10.040 --> 58:13.280]  tax groups because they're part of the system and they don't want the general
[58:13.280 --> 58:17.240]  public understanding this and knowing this so it's a very important situation
[58:17.240 --> 58:23.120]  with inflation all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do
[58:23.120 --> 58:26.680]  things tax wise it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your money
[58:26.680 --> 58:30.720]  we wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few
[58:30.720 --> 58:36.640]  years the only way you fail is not writing down the URL Jones tax relief

[59:55.680 --> 59:58.400]  resistance
[59:58.400 --> 1:00:16.080]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today and now your host Owen Troyer
[1:00:18.520 --> 1:00:23.640]  well the Biden administration is playing the blame game for the
[1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:28.840]  absolute economic devastation that has happened since Biden took office of the
[1:00:28.840 --> 1:00:33.160]  Democrats look over and there's no hiding it though everybody knows what's
[1:00:33.160 --> 1:00:38.960]  going on here's a compilation of Biden trying to claim because remember they
[1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:42.560]  admit oh yeah inflation's high it's Putin gas price is high it's Putin but
[1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:46.720]  then they say it's the greatest economic cover ever so here's Biden lying to the
[1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:49.560]  American people the Biden administration telling you how good it is
[1:00:49.560 --> 1:00:55.720]  I would have put food in a table for their kids to be able to have a little bit of breathing room
[1:00:58.840 --> 1:01:04.760]  as my dad would then say with a little breathing room to give families just a
[1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:13.920]  little bit more breathing room providing some extra breathing room for families
[1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:17.720]  my dad would just say just a little breathing room we're just looking for a
[1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:22.320]  little bit of breathing room as my dad used to say just a little more breathing
[1:01:22.320 --> 1:01:25.760]  room in order to provide a little breathing room for millions of American
[1:01:25.760 --> 1:01:30.720]  from us finally have a little more breathing room, even a little bit of breathing room
[1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:34.720]  just a little breathing room that little bit of breathing room, it's going to give
[1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:37.540]  these folks a little bit of breathing room in order to provide a little breathing
[1:01:37.540 --> 1:01:41.760]  room for millions of Americans families. It's just a little bit of breathing room
[1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:46.360]  more breathing room to give them just a little bit of breathing room
[1:01:46.360 --> 1:01:52.360]  just a little bit of breathing room. Everybody's entitled to just a little bit of breathing room.
[1:01:52.360 --> 1:01:56.360]  Just a little bit. A little bit of breathing room.
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:01.360]  You know, my dad used to say, every family is a little bit of breathing room.
[1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:05.360]  Got your breathing room?
[1:02:07.360 --> 1:02:10.360]  There's Joe Biden every month of his presidency saying,
[1:02:10.360 --> 1:02:12.360]  we're going to get you a little breathing room. A little breathing room.
[1:02:12.360 --> 1:02:17.360]  As they raise your taxes, raise the prices, cause inflation, all of it.
[1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:23.360]  Now, granted, you can't place the inflation thing just on the Biden administration,
[1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:29.360]  but the prices going up, the energy prices going up, that 100% you can.
[1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:33.360]  But that's the real inflation. It's not the devaluation of the dollar. That's been going on.
[1:02:33.360 --> 1:02:40.360]  The real inflation is the supply chain shortages, the scare cities, the shutting off the oil,
[1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:43.360]  shutting off the energy. That's what's caused it.
[1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:46.360]  But Biden wants to give you a little bit of breathing room, folks, as he's choking you.
[1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:50.360]  I'm just trying to give you a breathing room with his hands around your neck shaking you.
[1:02:50.360 --> 1:02:56.360]  Well, we do want to give you some breathing room, or at least some insurance in case of a total collapse.

[1:06:20.360 --> 1:06:23.360]  We're joined on the phone line by Savannah Hernandez.
[1:06:23.360 --> 1:06:27.360]  She's actually still in the field right now in Washington, D.C.
[1:06:27.360 --> 1:06:31.360]  There's all kinds of craziness going on this weekend in D.C.
[1:06:31.360 --> 1:06:35.360]  Including yesterday, a lot of the footage that we played in the first hour
[1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:40.360]  was from Savannah Hernandez at the D.C. Pride March that they had there.
[1:06:40.360 --> 1:06:46.360]  So the man walking around with his breasts out and his tuck job
[1:06:46.360 --> 1:06:50.360]  with his little underwear there, grinding around, humping the ground,
[1:06:50.360 --> 1:06:52.360]  in my opinion, assaulting an officer.
[1:06:52.360 --> 1:06:56.360]  And all that other footage captured by Savannah Hernandez,
[1:06:56.360 --> 1:06:58.360]  she joins me now on the phone.
[1:06:58.360 --> 1:07:02.360]  So Savannah, you've seen a lot of this activity more and more
[1:07:02.360 --> 1:07:05.360]  over the course of your career as a journalist in the field.
[1:07:05.360 --> 1:07:08.360]  Was this maybe the wildest that you've seen here?
[1:07:08.360 --> 1:07:13.360]  The kinks, the puppy play, the drag queens, the men with their breasts out,
[1:07:13.360 --> 1:07:17.360]  the children, I mean, just try to put it all into perspective for us
[1:07:17.360 --> 1:07:20.360]  that weren't there.
[1:07:20.360 --> 1:07:23.360]  I think the best way that I can put it in perspective,
[1:07:23.360 --> 1:07:28.360]  everything that I witnessed is, I feel spiritually depleted today
[1:07:28.360 --> 1:07:32.360]  after seeing everything that happened at our nation's capital.
[1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:36.360]  Again, we had children that were as young as one to two years old
[1:07:36.360 --> 1:07:38.360]  that were marching in this parade.
[1:07:38.360 --> 1:07:40.360]  And then you had grown men with their breasts out,
[1:07:40.360 --> 1:07:44.360]  working on police officers, and the crowd hearing the kids on
[1:07:44.360 --> 1:07:49.360]  as they marched, the newborn babies that were clad in rainbow gear
[1:07:49.360 --> 1:07:54.360]  as the parents had them attend this event and watch all of this happen
[1:07:54.360 --> 1:07:56.360]  was just insane to me.
[1:07:56.360 --> 1:08:01.360]  And, you know, it took me a while to even digest what I saw.
[1:08:01.360 --> 1:08:04.360]  As a grown adult, having to witness that was horrific,
[1:08:04.360 --> 1:08:09.360]  so I couldn't imagine what it would be like to witness this as a child.
[1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:11.360]  I'm in front of the White House right now as well,
[1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:16.360]  and we really have been conquered by the LGBTQ community.
[1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:18.360]  The federal building, the Treasury Department,
[1:08:18.360 --> 1:08:24.360]  currently has an LGBTQ flag flying alongside the American flag on top.
[1:08:24.360 --> 1:08:27.360]  Which version? I mean, there's so many versions now.
[1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:29.360]  Does it have the Ukraine flag in there?
[1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:33.360]  The OG original version. We don't have the Ukraine flag with this one.
[1:08:33.360 --> 1:08:34.360]  Just the rainbow.
[1:08:34.360 --> 1:08:36.360]  Wow, well, they need to get with the times.
[1:08:36.360 --> 1:08:43.360]  That's bigoted against trans and other sexual groups like puppy kinks and stuff,
[1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:45.360]  so they should probably change that.
[1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:49.360]  Yeah, and, you know, again, it was just so disturbing to have to witness everything,
[1:08:49.360 --> 1:08:54.360]  and there's still large amounts of the LGBTQ community walking around D.C.
[1:08:54.360 --> 1:08:56.360]  And what happened to public indecency?
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:08:59.360]  Didn't people used to go to jail for that type of thing?
[1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:01.360]  There were people walking around naked in the street
[1:09:01.360 --> 1:09:04.360]  or just straight up in their underwear, exposing themselves to children,
[1:09:04.360 --> 1:09:06.360]  twerking in the street.
[1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:09.360]  The entire event yesterday smelled like weed.
[1:09:09.360 --> 1:09:11.360]  People were openly drinking in the streets.
[1:09:11.360 --> 1:09:13.360]  It was like a giant block party,
[1:09:13.360 --> 1:09:17.360]  and there's children just playing in the grass alongside all of these adults
[1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:20.360]  who are essentially pumping each other in the park.
[1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:24.360]  I'm sorry to be vulgar, but that was what was happening during this event.
[1:09:24.360 --> 1:09:27.360]  So, again, the only words I can use to describe this are horrific,
[1:09:27.360 --> 1:09:30.360]  and it really just shows how much we've degraded as a nation.
[1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:32.360]  We've been conquered by this community.
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:35.360]  They're targeting our children. They say it's straight out.
[1:09:35.360 --> 1:09:37.360]  And what are we doing to counter any of this?
[1:09:37.360 --> 1:09:41.360]  Nothing. We've been conquered. Their flag is flying everywhere.
[1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:45.360]  Well, that was my point in the first hour was...
[1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:47.360]  And it really is. It's larger than even that.
[1:09:47.360 --> 1:09:51.360]  Any of this activity that we see in the name of gay pride
[1:09:51.360 --> 1:09:54.360]  or trans-storytime or any of this other stuff,
[1:09:54.360 --> 1:09:57.360]  in any other circumstances, it would be criminal.
[1:09:57.360 --> 1:10:01.360]  In any other circumstances, it would be considered indecent, lewd conducts,
[1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:04.360]  probably even an arrestable, finable offense.
[1:10:04.360 --> 1:10:07.360]  Here's a perfect example. The video you shot of the gentleman
[1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:10.360]  with his fake breasts out jumping around,
[1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:14.360]  and he goes up and he tries to twerk on a police officer.
[1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:16.360]  I feel so bad for that police officer.
[1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:20.360]  That police officer should have turned around and knocked that guy cold on his butt
[1:10:20.360 --> 1:10:26.360]  and arrested him for public indecency and lewd activity in front of a minor
[1:10:26.360 --> 1:10:28.360]  and see how he liked that.
[1:10:28.360 --> 1:10:32.360]  Oh, see, so you're allowed to do all this illegal activity, lewd,
[1:10:32.360 --> 1:10:36.360]  misconduct in front of minors, all this other stuff, because it's liberal.
[1:10:36.360 --> 1:10:40.360]  It's gay pride. In the other circumstance, you'd never be allowed to do that.
[1:10:40.360 --> 1:10:43.360]  But if it's, oh, if it's liberal, gay pride, okay, yeah, public indecency,
[1:10:43.360 --> 1:10:46.360]  lewdness in front of minors, it's all good.
[1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:49.360]  Exactly. And they kept spouting, love is love, love is love.
[1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:51.360]  And I said, okay, well, what does that mean?
[1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:54.360]  Because there are hundreds of minors in attendance today.
[1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:56.360]  Again, I think the youngest child that I saw,
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:11:00.360]  maybe one or two years old, toddling along, being hyped up by the crowd,
[1:11:00.360 --> 1:11:04.360]  holding a little rainbow hand-drawn sign that I'm sure, you know,
[1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:06.360]  his parents drew for him.
[1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:08.360]  And again, it's like, oh, love is love.
[1:11:08.360 --> 1:11:10.360]  You just love whoever you love.
[1:11:10.360 --> 1:11:12.360]  And that's what these people are doing.
[1:11:12.360 --> 1:11:14.360]  And that's what they're perpetuating in our society.
[1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:16.360]  And it's just, it's horrible.
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:21.360]  And, you know, the best part about that video is that man found my Instagram account
[1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:25.360]  and said that I was transphobic for the way that I framed the video.
[1:11:25.360 --> 1:11:28.360]  I said a man with breasts that's apparently transphobia.
[1:11:28.360 --> 1:11:33.360]  And because of Instagram, I can't call that out unless I want to get completely deleted
[1:11:33.360 --> 1:11:36.360]  off the face of the earth for exposing this type of corruption.
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:38.360]  So, um, that's big tech.
[1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:39.360]  That's the modern day.
[1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:43.360]  And of course, we have the mainstream media and every single major corporation in America
[1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:47.360]  propping up this same community who has dodacity to say that they were pressed,
[1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:49.360]  that they're the ones that are the victim in society.
[1:11:49.360 --> 1:11:51.360]  It's ridiculous.
[1:11:51.360 --> 1:11:56.360]  People have gotten arrested and charged and had their lives ruined in some cases
[1:11:56.360 --> 1:11:59.360]  for going behind a dumpster to urinate.
[1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:01.360]  And then they'll get caught and they'll get fined.
[1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:02.360]  They'll get public indecencies.
[1:12:02.360 --> 1:12:05.360]  If there's kids around, they'll get lewdness in front of a minor.
[1:12:05.360 --> 1:12:09.360]  They can put them on a sexual predator list for going to take a leak behind a dumpster
[1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:10.360]  in a woods or something.
[1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:11.360]  But, oh, you do it.
[1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:12.360]  You're liberal.
[1:12:12.360 --> 1:12:13.360]  You're gay.
[1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:14.360]  Like, then it's okay.
[1:12:14.360 --> 1:12:18.360]  Any other circumstances, this activity would be considered inappropriate.
[1:12:18.360 --> 1:12:20.360]  And here, there's so many different levels of the child abuse.
[1:12:20.360 --> 1:12:22.360]  And I don't know if you catch this in real time,
[1:12:22.360 --> 1:12:25.360]  but when we're going back and we're watching the footage,
[1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:28.360]  you can tell most of the children seem very unhappy at these events.
[1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:30.360]  They seem like they're drugged there.
[1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:32.360]  It seems like their parents are forcing them to do this.
[1:12:32.360 --> 1:12:37.360]  Even that video you talked about where it's that little kid walking with the rainbow up,
[1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:39.360]  you can see the parents have set it up.
[1:12:39.360 --> 1:12:41.360]  It's like a movie shot for them.
[1:12:41.360 --> 1:12:42.360]  They have them walking there alone.
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:44.360]  They're walking in front of them filming like it's a movie shot.
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:48.360]  These parents, these adults are just using their kids to virtue signal like,
[1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:50.360]  oh, look at how great I am as an ally.
[1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:52.360]  I'm sexualizing my kid.
[1:12:52.360 --> 1:12:53.360]  I'm grooming my kid.
[1:12:53.360 --> 1:12:54.360]  Aren't I great as an ally?
[1:12:54.360 --> 1:12:59.360]  Oh, look, I'm going to put this on social media and get a bunch of likes and a bunch of shares.
[1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:01.360]  I mean, how many of you realize, yeah.
[1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:02.360]  Exactly.
[1:13:02.360 --> 1:13:04.360]  And you know, the indoctrination and the brainwashing of our youth was so apparent.
[1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:07.360]  I interviewed two young girls, probably 15, 16 years old.
[1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:11.360]  This young girl tells me, oh, well, I'm queer, and then I thought I was canned,
[1:13:11.360 --> 1:13:15.360]  and I thought I was bi, and then, you know, now I'm trans-masked.
[1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:21.360]  And she just goes through this entire list of all of these fake ideologies and fake sexualities
[1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:27.360]  that this community has created and pushed on these young children that just want to feel loved and accepted in life.
[1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:33.360]  And again, because instead of, you know, raising up children in a traditional home, traditional family,
[1:13:33.360 --> 1:13:38.360]  they are now being victimized and attacked by this community because a lot of them don't have strong parents
[1:13:38.360 --> 1:13:40.360]  who are raising them properly.
[1:13:40.360 --> 1:13:47.360]  They're latching onto these ideologies, they are confused, they're upset, the LGBTQ community loves to tout how high their suicide rates are.
[1:13:47.360 --> 1:13:49.360]  It's because they're degenerate.
[1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:53.360]  It's because, look at the lifestyle that they're promoting, look at what they're doing to children.
[1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:55.360]  They can't be happy, and I could see it in all of their eyes.
[1:13:55.360 --> 1:13:57.360]  They were soulless, they were sad.
[1:13:57.360 --> 1:13:59.360]  I didn't like being in that environment.
[1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:00.360]  It drained me.
[1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:07.360]  I'm still drained today having to be around these people who are pretending to be happy and pretending that what they're doing is a good thing
[1:14:07.360 --> 1:14:11.360]  when in reality they're all mentally ill degenerate.
[1:14:11.360 --> 1:14:15.360]  Yeah, and just watching the footage, it doesn't look like the children are happy.
[1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:18.360]  It looks like they're forced to be there.
[1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:26.360]  And, yeah, then they see a dude humping the ground in front of them with fake breasts.
[1:14:26.360 --> 1:14:29.360]  It's a little shocking, they tend to stare.
[1:14:29.360 --> 1:14:31.360]  That doesn't mean that they like it.
[1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:34.360]  Savannah, where can people see all of your videos?
[1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:38.360]  Because it's impossible for me to even play them in this two-hour show.
[1:14:38.360 --> 1:14:46.360]  People can find my videos on TrueSocial at SavSays or on my YouTube channel, SavSays, Instagram at Savwith1n.
[1:14:46.360 --> 1:14:52.360]  And again, go share those clips and videos because it's only a matter of time before I'm completely banned again
[1:14:52.360 --> 1:15:00.360]  because I will be accused of targeting the LGBTQ community because I'm showing the world what they are doing to children.
[1:15:00.360 --> 1:15:04.360]  Was there any pushback in D.C. at all yesterday?
[1:15:04.360 --> 1:15:07.360]  Nope, the police were enjoying their time.
[1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:12.360]  And again, I think I was in front of the only police officer who didn't look like he was enjoying it.
[1:15:12.360 --> 1:15:17.360]  But even the fire department was marching in the parade. Muriel Bowser was marching in the parade.
[1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:20.360]  So the government fully involved with this.
[1:15:20.360 --> 1:15:27.360]  And like I said, the LGBTQ flag flying alongside the American on the majority of federal buildings here near the White House.
[1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:29.360]  My word.
[1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:31.360]  All right, Savannah Hernandez.
[1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:34.360]  I know it's not fun to have to go and be a part of that stuff.
[1:15:34.360 --> 1:15:36.360]  It's just so toxic. You don't want to be anywhere near it.
[1:15:36.360 --> 1:15:40.360]  But you've got the best shots, I would say, from the D.C. event.
[1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:43.360]  And so we thank you for it. We thank you for joining us out here.
[1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:47.360]  And stay safe. Stay sane out there, Savannah Hernandez.
[1:15:47.360 --> 1:15:49.360]  Thanks, guys.
[1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:59.360]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, believe it or not, we've got more.
[1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:24.360]  And I do the work of 25, 30 year olds and I work them into the ground and you want to know why.
[1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:27.360]  And I've tested this and I've taken your B12.
[1:16:27.360 --> 1:16:31.360]  And let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price. I really do.
[1:16:31.360 --> 1:16:34.360]  I take that B12 and I'm electric, man.
[1:16:34.360 --> 1:16:39.360]  I can run 10 miles. I did some pretty heavy work with the highway department.
[1:16:39.360 --> 1:16:45.360]  And my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah, for a guy in his 60s, you know, pushing 70,
[1:16:45.360 --> 1:16:57.360]  and I know I'm not just blowing smoke here. The B12 saves my life.
[1:16:57.360 --> 1:17:01.360]  I designed over 200 T-shirts the last 25 years.
[1:17:01.360 --> 1:17:05.360]  And we have some of those original designs still for sale at m4store.com.
[1:17:05.360 --> 1:17:06.360]  These are real classics.
[1:17:06.360 --> 1:17:12.360]  But ladies and gentlemen, they're all about to be limited edition because we're selling out of them.
[1:17:12.360 --> 1:17:17.360]  They're about to be history and we're selling out of the hoodies, the ball caps, the T-shirts,
[1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:20.360]  all these amazing designs at costm4store.com.

[1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:46.360]  resistance to the new world order than the Alex Jones was right shirt,
[1:17:46.360 --> 1:17:49.360]  exclusively available at infowarsstore.com.
[1:17:49.360 --> 1:17:52.360]  And again, this shirt is limited edition as well.

[1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:26.360]  I told you over two years ago, the globalists were going to have massive inflation
[1:18:26.360 --> 1:18:29.360]  and food shortages and it's happened just like clockwork.
[1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:32.360]  And I'm telling you, it's going to get a lot worse.
[1:18:32.360 --> 1:18:33.360]  They have designed this.

[1:18:56.360 --> 1:18:57.360]  Take action.
[1:18:57.360 --> 1:19:03.360]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[1:19:03.360 --> 1:19:05.360]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[1:19:05.360 --> 1:19:09.360]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[1:19:09.360 --> 1:19:10.360]  I tried to stop it.
[1:19:10.360 --> 1:19:15.360]  And now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever
[1:19:15.360 --> 1:19:20.360]  because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents.
[1:19:20.360 --> 1:19:22.360]  It's now out in the open.
[1:19:22.360 --> 1:19:28.360]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group.
[1:19:28.360 --> 1:19:31.360]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:35.360]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[1:19:35.360 --> 1:19:36.360]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:19:36.360 --> 1:19:38.360]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[1:19:38.360 --> 1:19:42.360]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support
[1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:45.360]  because without you, info wars would not be here.
[1:19:45.360 --> 1:19:48.360]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war
[1:19:48.360 --> 1:19:51.360]  and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:19:51.360 --> 1:19:54.360]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done
[1:19:54.360 --> 1:20:23.360]  and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[1:20:23.360 --> 1:20:30.360]  The head of Drag Queen Story Hour Organization arrested for child porn and yet another.
[1:20:30.360 --> 1:20:36.360]  How many of these Drag Queen Story Time, Drag Queen Dance Time organization leaders
[1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:45.360]  have criminal records, prostitution, drug dealing, solicitation of a minor child porn possession, all of it?
[1:20:45.360 --> 1:20:51.360]  Can't swing a stick at one of these events without hitting one of them.
[1:20:51.360 --> 1:20:54.360]  We've got more, believe it or not, we've got more.
[1:20:54.360 --> 1:20:56.360]  Let's check it out now.
[1:20:56.360 --> 1:21:01.360]  We go back to DC where a marcher notices a group of children and says,
[1:21:01.360 --> 1:21:11.360]  ooh, children, I'm going to really get freaky with it in clip 10.
[1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:12.360]  Oh yeah, that's nice.
[1:21:12.360 --> 1:21:14.360]  Ooh, a group of kids are about to walk by.
[1:21:14.360 --> 1:21:17.360]  I'm going to bend over and show them my ass.
[1:21:17.360 --> 1:21:19.360]  It's liberal, it's liberal, it's liberal.
[1:21:19.360 --> 1:21:24.360]  It's liberal, it's gay pride.
[1:21:24.360 --> 1:21:28.360]  Any other time it'd be public indecency, lewd misconduct in front of a minor.
[1:21:28.360 --> 1:21:36.360]  But if it's liberal and gay pride, then we'd love it.
[1:21:36.360 --> 1:21:41.360]  What a deranged time we live in.
[1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:47.360]  What an odd thing.
[1:21:47.360 --> 1:21:50.360]  What do they just sit there and scream because they're waving their flags?
[1:21:50.360 --> 1:21:53.360]  What are we cheering on here?
[1:21:53.360 --> 1:21:55.360]  We're just celebrating how we're grooming children.
[1:21:55.360 --> 1:21:56.360]  What are you talking about?
[1:21:56.360 --> 1:21:57.360]  Here's more of it, guys.
[1:21:57.360 --> 1:22:01.360]  Let's keep the fun rolling in clip 11.
[1:22:01.360 --> 1:22:06.360]  Oh yeah, let that kid be trans.
[1:22:06.360 --> 1:22:08.360]  Protect trans kids.
[1:22:08.360 --> 1:22:13.360]  Just footage of all the kids they have parading here.
[1:22:13.360 --> 1:22:21.360]  It's just so infuriating.
[1:22:21.360 --> 1:22:26.360]  It's just so despicable.
[1:22:26.360 --> 1:22:29.360]  They just scream and wave their gay flags.
[1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:33.360]  Any of these children seem happy.
[1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:37.360]  Here, let's bring out the strippers.
[1:22:37.360 --> 1:22:39.360]  Let's bring out the youth strippers.
[1:22:39.360 --> 1:22:45.360]  Of course, that'll do it.
[1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:51.360]  I'm not seeing many kids that are having that much fun.
[1:22:51.360 --> 1:22:56.360]  All these children, they don't really seem to be having much fun.
[1:22:56.360 --> 1:22:59.360]  You know, they might like something like, I don't know, maybe like a petting zoo,
[1:22:59.360 --> 1:23:03.360]  or maybe like a hay ride, or I don't know,
[1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:08.360]  stuff that kids have been doing in America having fun for decades.
[1:23:08.360 --> 1:23:11.360]  Here's the child abuse right here.
[1:23:11.360 --> 1:23:14.360]  Oh my gosh.
[1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:17.360]  Here was the interview Savannah Hernandez was talking to.
[1:23:17.360 --> 1:23:20.360]  The interview she was talking about in the last segment,
[1:23:20.360 --> 1:23:23.360]  where they've got the youth so confused, folks.
[1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:25.360]  When you've got an individual this confused,
[1:23:25.360 --> 1:23:29.360]  do you really think they have a shot to be successful and prosperous?
[1:23:29.360 --> 1:23:31.360]  And I'm not trying to be rude to this young girl.
[1:23:31.360 --> 1:23:36.360]  She's just been blasted by psychological weaponry and bisexual weaponry.
[1:23:36.360 --> 1:23:38.360]  And so this is what happens.
[1:23:38.360 --> 1:23:41.360]  Do you think this individual has been well prepared to succeed in the world
[1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:44.360]  in clip 12 by her liberal colleagues?
[1:23:44.360 --> 1:23:48.360]  I'm gay.
[1:23:48.360 --> 1:23:54.360]  What age did you know that you were gay?
[1:23:54.360 --> 1:24:00.360]  I think at like 10, I knew that I, I think at 10, but I wasn't like,
[1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:02.360]  I wasn't clear on my gender.
[1:24:02.360 --> 1:24:07.360]  I, I think it was around like 10 as well when I started questioning
[1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:08.360]  if I was bi.
[1:24:08.360 --> 1:24:11.360]  And then since then it was kind of like a slippery slope because I kept,
[1:24:11.360 --> 1:24:13.360]  I was like, am I bi, omnilezbian?
[1:24:13.360 --> 1:24:17.360]  And then I kind of like came to the point and recently I've been like.
[1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:19.360]  Now pause it real quick.
[1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:22.360]  These girls seem to be about high school age.
[1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:24.360]  Young girls here.
[1:24:24.360 --> 1:24:27.360]  And they don't know what they're saying.
[1:24:27.360 --> 1:24:28.360]  Oh, maybe I was gay when I was 10.
[1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:29.360]  They don't know what they're saying.
[1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:32.360]  It's all a fad, folks. It's all a trend.
[1:24:32.360 --> 1:24:36.360]  Think about how many trends and fads you go through when you're a kid.
[1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:39.360]  Think about all the different things that come and go when you're a kid.
[1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:42.360]  One day you really, you're convinced this is who you are.
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:44.360]  The next day you're convinced this is who they are.
[1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:46.360]  But see, with the sexual stuff, it's all promoted.
[1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:48.360]  It's all propagandized.
[1:24:48.360 --> 1:24:49.360]  It's all injected.
[1:24:49.360 --> 1:24:56.360]  And then it's all enforced and reinforced so that they try to carry it with them forever.
[1:24:56.360 --> 1:25:00.360]  Do you think these people sound like they're prepared to be adults on this planet?
[1:25:00.360 --> 1:25:06.360]  Do you think these two are being prepared to succeed in this world by their liberal indoctrination?
[1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:07.360]  Let's continue.
[1:25:07.360 --> 1:25:08.360]  Like am I pan?
[1:25:08.360 --> 1:25:12.360]  But then I, like, I think now I'm starting to realize that I'm queer.
[1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:14.360]  But yeah, it was, it started around 10.
[1:25:14.360 --> 1:25:16.360]  So pause it.
[1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:17.360]  What are we talking about?
[1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:19.360]  We're talking about sex.
[1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:20.360]  Okay.
[1:25:20.360 --> 1:25:22.360]  Let's just, let's be clear here.
[1:25:22.360 --> 1:25:25.360]  We're talking about sex.
[1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:29.360]  How do you know if you're a pansexual or any of the stuff they're talking about?
[1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:31.360]  What do you like to do?
[1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:36.360]  I mean, do I have to have a biology lesson here?
[1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:40.360]  So, oh yeah, by the age of 10, oh yeah, I liked pansexual folks.
[1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:43.360]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you what they claim pansexual to mean.
[1:25:43.360 --> 1:25:46.360]  A 10-year-old is not a pansexual.
[1:25:46.360 --> 1:25:49.360]  It's all a fad.
[1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:56.360]  It's all a fad, like, if I'm 10 years old and I watch the Ghostbusters and I think I'm
[1:25:56.360 --> 1:25:57.360]  Dr. Venkman.
[1:25:57.360 --> 1:26:04.360]  And so, you know, I run around with a little outfit I've got on and a little toy I've got
[1:26:04.360 --> 1:26:06.360]  pretending to vanquish ghosts.
[1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:11.360]  Or I'm playing Star Wars with my friends and we're building forts in the basement.
[1:26:11.360 --> 1:26:16.360]  We've got little guns and lightsabers and, oh, we think we're Star Wars Jedi knights.
[1:26:16.360 --> 1:26:19.360]  Let's pretend it's a fad.
[1:26:19.360 --> 1:26:22.360]  I'm not still pretending to be a Jedi.
[1:26:22.360 --> 1:26:24.360]  I'm not still playing with lightsabers.
[1:26:24.360 --> 1:26:25.360]  Oh, maybe I am.
[1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:27.360]  I don't know.
[1:26:27.360 --> 1:26:34.360]  So the point is, it's kids and they get shown all this different sexual crap.
[1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:36.360]  So it's not, oh, I'm watching Star Wars.
[1:26:36.360 --> 1:26:37.360]  I think I'm a Jedi.
[1:26:37.360 --> 1:26:39.360]  Oh, I'm watching Ghostbusters.
[1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:41.360]  I think I'm Dr. Venkman.
[1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:43.360]  Or even with sports.
[1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:45.360]  Oh, I'm watching my favorite sports.
[1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:47.360]  I think I'm a basketball player.
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:51.360]  No, it's all sex stuff that they can introduce to.
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:55.360]  And then they see it all over the world around them with all the other propaganda.
[1:26:55.360 --> 1:26:57.360]  So it becomes this fad.
[1:26:57.360 --> 1:26:59.360]  But then how do you keep the fad going?
[1:26:59.360 --> 1:27:02.360]  Well, you're constantly changing your sex, see?
[1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:03.360]  You're constantly changing.
[1:27:03.360 --> 1:27:05.360]  So that's how they keep the propaganda going.
[1:27:05.360 --> 1:27:09.360]  They tell the kids, they show them the propaganda, they bring it in as a fad.
[1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:14.360]  And then they give them all these different flavors and tastes and colors to kind of change around with
[1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:16.360]  so that they never leave the table.
[1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:18.360]  Here, let's finish this clip.
[1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:19.360]  It started around 10.
[1:27:19.360 --> 1:27:26.360]  It wasn't fully formed, but I guess that's when I realized, wait, that's a possibility?
[1:27:26.360 --> 1:27:27.360]  Yeah.
[1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:30.360]  I am genderqueer, transmask and queer.
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:31.360]  What's transmask?
[1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:38.360]  Transmask is people under the non-binary umbrella identifying or presenting mask.
[1:27:38.360 --> 1:27:39.360]  Masculine?
[1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:40.360]  Yeah.
[1:27:40.360 --> 1:27:41.360]  What about you?
[1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:48.360]  I'm trans and my sexuality is unlabeled.
[1:27:48.360 --> 1:27:50.360]  I use he, him pronouns.
[1:27:50.360 --> 1:27:51.360]  Yeah, and I use he, they pronouns.
[1:27:51.360 --> 1:27:53.360]  Tell us what you guys identify as.
[1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:54.360]  We're asking everyone here today.
[1:27:54.360 --> 1:27:55.360]  Gay, fuck.
[1:27:55.360 --> 1:27:56.360]  Gay.
[1:27:56.360 --> 1:27:57.360]  Gay.
[1:27:57.360 --> 1:27:58.360]  Gay.
[1:27:58.360 --> 1:27:59.360]  Sis.
[1:27:59.360 --> 1:28:00.360]  What is it?
[1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:01.360]  Sis, gender male.
[1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:02.360]  There we go.
[1:28:02.360 --> 1:28:03.360]  I don't know.
[1:28:03.360 --> 1:28:06.360]  Gender, gender neutral or gender fluid.
[1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:07.360]  I think that's what they say.
[1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:08.360]  I don't know.
[1:28:08.360 --> 1:28:09.360]  I'm confused.
[1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:10.360]  Yeah.
[1:28:10.360 --> 1:28:11.360]  Gender fluid?
[1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:12.360]  I don't know.
[1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:14.360]  It's all made up.
[1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:18.360]  It, I feel like, honestly, honestly, it should not be a bad thing.
[1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:21.360]  Like, I've talked to people who go with they and them.
[1:28:21.360 --> 1:28:26.360]  I'm like, well, in the grammar of things, how would you want to represent yourself?
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:28.360]  I was like, I mean, I guess it.
[1:28:28.360 --> 1:28:31.360]  Because it's like, you're it, you're the it.
[1:28:31.360 --> 1:28:33.360]  Like, it shouldn't be a bad name.
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:35.360]  It should just be owned.
[1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:36.360]  Gay.
[1:28:36.360 --> 1:28:37.360]  Yes.
[1:28:37.360 --> 1:28:40.360]  I identify it.
[1:28:40.360 --> 1:28:41.360]  Do you see her?
[1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:42.360]  Oh.
[1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:43.360]  She.
[1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:45.360]  Pronouns are he, him.
[1:28:45.360 --> 1:28:46.360]  Sometimes you stay.
[1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:47.360]  I don't get it.
[1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:49.360]  I'm sure these people are going to be smashing successes.
[1:28:49.360 --> 1:28:52.360]  They've all been built for success here.
[1:28:52.360 --> 1:28:53.360]  You know.
[1:28:53.360 --> 1:28:54.360]  Hey, what's your experience?
[1:28:54.360 --> 1:28:55.360]  What experience?
[1:28:55.360 --> 1:28:56.360]  I'm gay.

[1:30:03.360 --> 1:30:06.360]  which is we thought, you know, this is going to level the playing field.
[1:30:06.360 --> 1:30:08.360]  Everybody's going to have access to the same information

[1:30:22.360 --> 1:30:27.360]  whenever we want, and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing
[1:30:27.360 --> 1:30:33.360]  and trying to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us
[1:30:33.360 --> 1:30:38.360]  because of the conversations we're having, because of the Internet searches that we're doing,
[1:30:38.360 --> 1:30:42.360]  because of the discussions, the people we want to talk to about these things.
[1:30:42.360 --> 1:30:46.360]  So that's our goal, is to help people take back their freedom

[1:33:21.360 --> 1:33:27.360]  Waging war on corruption, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:27.360 --> 1:33:30.360]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:33:30.360 --> 1:33:34.360]  All right, I think we'll be able to cover the rest of it here in this segment,
[1:33:34.360 --> 1:33:40.360]  the rest of the videos that we still haven't gotten to, including, I mean,
[1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:46.360]  perhaps the most ridiculous ludicrous, absurd marketing campaign you've ever seen
[1:33:46.360 --> 1:33:48.360]  in your life from Postmates.
[1:33:48.360 --> 1:33:53.360]  This one is, oh boy, wow.
[1:33:53.360 --> 1:33:56.360]  But let's finish up some of the sights and scenes from the events.
[1:33:56.360 --> 1:33:58.360]  Here's one more from Savannah Hernandez.
[1:33:58.360 --> 1:34:04.360]  Attendees, explain why it's a good thing that kids are being groomed at Pride Marches.
[1:34:04.360 --> 1:34:07.360]  I noticed there's a lot of kids in attendance here this year.
[1:34:07.360 --> 1:34:10.360]  Are there always this many kids and also do you think it's a good thing?
[1:34:10.360 --> 1:34:11.360]  Absolutely.
[1:34:11.360 --> 1:34:15.360]  And it is a great thing because I feel like making sure that children are aware
[1:34:15.360 --> 1:34:18.360]  of what is around them is important.
[1:34:18.360 --> 1:34:19.360]  Oh, gay sex?
[1:34:19.360 --> 1:34:22.360]  Just because you are around certain things doesn't mean that you're going to be persuaded
[1:34:22.360 --> 1:34:24.360]  to be a part of things, but you should be aware of that.
[1:34:24.360 --> 1:34:26.360]  Wow, you're that dumb, huh?
[1:34:26.360 --> 1:34:27.360]  To live around you.
[1:34:27.360 --> 1:34:28.360]  And if you're not capable...
[1:34:28.360 --> 1:34:30.360]  Have you heard of nurture?
[1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:31.360]  It's a developmental problem.
[1:34:31.360 --> 1:34:32.360]  And this is...
[1:34:32.360 --> 1:34:34.360]  This is a guy in a cheetah costume, by the way.
[1:34:34.360 --> 1:34:37.360]  Some of the kids who maybe saw some nudity here, maybe saw some twerking.
[1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:38.360]  What do you think about that?
[1:34:38.360 --> 1:34:41.360]  Sometimes when you grow up, you see some nudity.
[1:34:41.360 --> 1:34:43.360]  Do you understand that?
[1:34:43.360 --> 1:34:45.360]  It helps you to understand who you are.
[1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:47.360]  Sometimes you're going to see some twerking.
[1:34:47.360 --> 1:34:48.360]  I absolutely love it.
[1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:50.360]  I work at a Montessori Daycare.
[1:34:50.360 --> 1:34:52.360]  Yeah, pause it, guys.
[1:34:52.360 --> 1:34:54.360]  Yeah, come on, man.
[1:34:54.360 --> 1:34:57.360]  Every once in a while, kids are going to watch a 400-pound dude shake his ass in his face.
[1:34:57.360 --> 1:34:58.360]  Come on, man.
[1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:02.360]  Yeah, you know, kid walks down the street, sees a guy, sees a guy, you know.
[1:35:02.360 --> 1:35:07.360]  Doing the old meat cycle there with the old male member.
[1:35:07.360 --> 1:35:10.360]  Kid walking down, gets a little lewd misconduct.
[1:35:10.360 --> 1:35:12.360]  So that's the deal, guys.
[1:35:12.360 --> 1:35:15.360]  Hey, you're, you know, if someone tries to hit you for a lewd misconduct,
[1:35:15.360 --> 1:35:16.360]  you're taking a leak at a ballgame.
[1:35:16.360 --> 1:35:18.360]  Just say, whoa, whoa, gay pride, bro.
[1:35:18.360 --> 1:35:19.360]  Gay pride.
[1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:21.360]  Hey, gay pride.
[1:35:21.360 --> 1:35:23.360]  Maybe you can have a little rainbow flag with you.
[1:35:23.360 --> 1:35:25.360]  Police starts to approach you to write you a ticket.
[1:35:25.360 --> 1:35:28.360]  You're taking a leak, you know, outside of a ballgame or something behind a dumpster.
[1:35:28.360 --> 1:35:31.360]  You whip out that gay pride flag, start waving it.
[1:35:31.360 --> 1:35:33.360]  Whoa, whoa, buddy.
[1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:34.360]  You don't want to be a bigot.
[1:35:34.360 --> 1:35:37.360]  You're not going to arrest a gay pride marcher now, are you?
[1:35:37.360 --> 1:35:39.360]  It's like, whoa, sir, I'm sorry.
[1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:41.360]  I thought you were just peeing back here.
[1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:45.360]  That would have been sexual lewd misconduct in front of minors that are down the street here.
[1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:48.360]  But I didn't realize this was a gay pride march flaunt away.
[1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:53.360]  Go have a golden, go to a golden fountain down by the kids if you want to.
[1:35:53.360 --> 1:35:55.360]  Sir, I didn't realize you were gay.
[1:35:55.360 --> 1:35:56.360]  Excuse me.
[1:35:56.360 --> 1:35:58.360]  My bad here.
[1:35:58.360 --> 1:36:01.360]  I thought you were back here trying to take a leak.
[1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:02.360]  That would have been a crime.
[1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:05.360]  But you were back here showing the kids you're Johnson because you're gay?
[1:36:05.360 --> 1:36:07.360]  Right on, brother.
[1:36:07.360 --> 1:36:08.360]  Excuse me.
[1:36:08.360 --> 1:36:09.360]  Pardon me.
[1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:15.360]  We're going to work at a Montessori Daycare, and we are a very open sexuality base.
[1:36:15.360 --> 1:36:16.360]  We're going to the Daycare.
[1:36:16.360 --> 1:36:18.360]  Oh, we're open sexually with our kids.
[1:36:18.360 --> 1:36:23.360]  Natural children that are non-binary, very queer, and it's just a beautiful city.
[1:36:23.360 --> 1:36:25.360]  So I'd love to see it here as well.
[1:36:25.360 --> 1:36:26.360]  Thank you for the chance.
[1:36:26.360 --> 1:36:27.360]  Guys, it's fine.
[1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:28.360]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:29.360]  Guys, look here.
[1:36:29.360 --> 1:36:30.360]  All right.
[1:36:30.360 --> 1:36:38.360]  I've got a little, I've got a little, this is a little sound pack.
[1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:39.360]  I don't know what we call these things.
[1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:41.360]  A little sound receiver here.
[1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:42.360]  Okay.
[1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:44.360]  See this?
[1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:47.360]  This is a binary system that you have here.
[1:36:47.360 --> 1:36:48.360]  Okay.
[1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:50.360]  Here's one end of the system right here.
[1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:51.360]  Okay.
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:52.360]  Right here.
[1:36:52.360 --> 1:36:53.360]  Give me a doc cam.
[1:36:53.360 --> 1:36:54.360]  Let me just explain this to the liberals.
[1:36:54.360 --> 1:36:56.360]  They appear, maybe they don't get this.
[1:36:56.360 --> 1:36:59.360]  It's pretty simple stuff, but liberals, guys, give me a doc cam.
[1:36:59.360 --> 1:37:00.360]  Okay.
[1:37:00.360 --> 1:37:01.360]  This is a binary system here.
[1:37:01.360 --> 1:37:05.360]  I've got one piece and I've got a second piece right here.
[1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:06.360]  Okay.
[1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:10.360]  Notice how this one piece fits into the other piece whole like that.
[1:37:10.360 --> 1:37:11.360]  See that?
[1:37:11.360 --> 1:37:13.360]  And now I've got sound.
[1:37:13.360 --> 1:37:17.360]  Now the technology works.
[1:37:17.360 --> 1:37:27.360]  Now the purpose of the binary system works as intended, just like our binary systems.
[1:37:27.360 --> 1:37:29.360]  Is that a good one for you there?
[1:37:29.360 --> 1:37:30.360]  Good little example.
[1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:31.360]  Do you get it?
[1:37:31.360 --> 1:37:32.360]  It doesn't work any other way.
[1:37:32.360 --> 1:37:38.360]  Yeah, like the airline telling you how gay they are, like, yeah, if I try to plug two
[1:37:38.360 --> 1:37:41.360]  of the same parts into one another, guess what?
[1:37:41.360 --> 1:37:46.360]  You're not going to take off the plane, are you?
[1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:52.360]  Because it didn't work.
[1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:53.360]  Wow.
[1:37:53.360 --> 1:37:54.360]  So there you go.
[1:37:54.360 --> 1:38:00.360]  But let's continue here with them telling you how great it is that kids are there.
[1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:04.860]  Well, they get the chance to see such a diverse culture.
[1:38:04.860 --> 1:38:08.360]  They get the chance to be open to whatever their body.
[1:38:08.360 --> 1:38:10.360]  What was that?
[1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:12.360]  Oh, God, stop it.
[1:38:12.360 --> 1:38:14.360]  Bring it on back.
[1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:16.360]  Wait a second now.
[1:38:16.360 --> 1:38:17.360]  What?
[1:38:17.360 --> 1:38:20.360]  You saw it too.
[1:38:20.360 --> 1:38:22.360]  Guys, rewind that one back for me.
[1:38:22.360 --> 1:38:23.360]  I don't know.
[1:38:23.360 --> 1:38:26.360]  We got to identify whatever that was.
[1:38:26.360 --> 1:38:31.360]  Oh, my God.
[1:38:31.360 --> 1:38:34.360]  Don't even make me say it.
[1:38:34.360 --> 1:38:36.360]  Is that a dildo tale?
[1:38:36.360 --> 1:38:38.360]  What the hell?
[1:38:38.360 --> 1:38:42.360]  I mean, that's the thing is I'm watching these images just flash across the screen.
[1:38:42.360 --> 1:38:46.360]  I mean, this person is walking around in a rat tail.
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:48.360]  Is that a sex thing?
[1:38:48.360 --> 1:38:50.360]  I don't want to know.
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:51.360]  Here's someone.
[1:38:51.360 --> 1:38:53.360]  They got their partners on leashes.
[1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:56.360]  They got them with like chains and whips.
[1:38:56.360 --> 1:38:58.360]  I mean, keep it in the bedroom.
[1:38:58.360 --> 1:39:00.360]  Why is that such a big thing?
[1:39:00.360 --> 1:39:02.360]  Keep it in the bedroom.
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:06.360]  I don't want to know that you wear a rat tail for sex.
[1:39:06.360 --> 1:39:19.360]  I mean, oh, oh, oh, I get it.
[1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:23.360]  All right, you put your partner on a leash and you drag them around the bedroom.
[1:39:23.360 --> 1:39:24.360]  Okay.
[1:39:24.360 --> 1:39:25.360]  Keep it there.
[1:39:25.360 --> 1:39:27.360]  I mean, what is that?
[1:39:27.360 --> 1:39:34.360]  Guys, if you are seeing what's on the screen, I just, they have, they have like dog sex kink
[1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:41.360]  parks where sex kink dogs go and pretend their puppies and play in a little dog park with
[1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:44.360]  other puppy plays.
[1:39:44.360 --> 1:39:49.360]  I don't want to know that you wear a rat tail during sex.
[1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:50.360]  Please.
[1:39:50.360 --> 1:39:53.360]  Where do you, folks, she's wearing that out in public.
[1:39:53.360 --> 1:39:55.360]  Where do you think that's been?
[1:39:55.360 --> 1:40:03.360]  What type of degenerate, disgusting activities has that rat tail been a part of?
[1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:06.360]  And now she's out wearing it in the streets?
[1:40:06.360 --> 1:40:09.360]  Has that thing been properly cleaned?
[1:40:09.360 --> 1:40:14.360]  Oh, these furries that they like to do their stuff inside their costumes, like that's their
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:15.360]  whole thing.
[1:40:15.360 --> 1:40:16.760]  They don't even clean those things.
[1:40:16.760 --> 1:40:20.360]  They run around hugging children with them.
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:24.360]  There was another slide in that, in that video montage where there's like a little boy like
[1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:26.360]  dry humping a grown man.
[1:40:26.360 --> 1:40:29.360]  I mean, folks, I'm like, I don't want to see this stuff.
[1:40:29.360 --> 1:40:31.360]  I'm sorry.
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:34.360]  Oh, the rat tail got me.
[1:40:34.360 --> 1:40:36.360]  All right.
[1:40:36.360 --> 1:40:40.360]  The rat tail got me.
[1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:42.360]  You walk it?
[1:40:42.360 --> 1:40:47.360]  I mean, now I'm just, I mean, there's so many questions.
[1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:49.360]  I mean, what are you doing?
[1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:51.360]  You walk into your local sex dungeon?
[1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:53.360]  Yeah, can I get the rat tail?
[1:40:53.360 --> 1:40:58.360]  Yeah, you got one.
[1:40:58.360 --> 1:41:02.360]  You got one of them rat tails.
[1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:07.360]  Yeah, I was at an orgy last night and I saw someone run around in a rat tail.
[1:41:07.360 --> 1:41:09.360]  It's really hot to me.
[1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:12.360]  I didn't know maybe you had some lying around.
[1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:15.360]  What do you, what is that?
[1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:17.360]  Oh, it's the doggie tail.
[1:41:17.360 --> 1:41:19.360]  Oh, that's the doggie tail.
[1:41:19.360 --> 1:41:21.360]  Oh, okay.
[1:41:21.360 --> 1:41:26.360]  Yeah, yeah, I saw someone run around in a doggie tail at my local orgy last night.
[1:41:26.360 --> 1:41:28.360]  Yeah, I was getting whipped and beaten.
[1:41:28.360 --> 1:41:32.360]  And I noticed, I noticed somebody ran by with a doggie tail.
[1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:35.360]  So I was thinking maybe I should get myself one of those.
[1:41:35.360 --> 1:41:37.360]  I barely remember it.
[1:41:37.360 --> 1:41:40.360]  I was, you know, as part of my kink is being beaten half to death.
[1:41:40.360 --> 1:41:42.360]  I'm going to teach my kids too.
[1:41:42.360 --> 1:41:43.360]  It's great.
[1:41:43.360 --> 1:41:45.360]  I'll just go back to the clip.
[1:41:45.360 --> 1:41:47.360]  I can't even.
[1:41:47.360 --> 1:41:50.360]  Their body or their mind is telling themselves.
[1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:53.360]  They get to learn that at such a young age and I love that for them.
[1:41:53.360 --> 1:41:57.360]  A lot of people like that are, claim to not be homophobic say that like,
[1:41:57.360 --> 1:41:59.360]  they shouldn't get their kids involved.
[1:41:59.360 --> 1:42:01.360]  They shouldn't get kids involved with this type of stuff.
[1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:04.360]  But I think that like it should be adding little kids to it.
[1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:06.360]  It kind of helps normalize pride.
[1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:12.360]  I like, I'm so excited for our future because I know that it's going to be open and like accepting.
[1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:15.360]  And I'm really like happy that it's even positive right there.
[1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:17.360]  See, that's that folks.
[1:42:17.360 --> 1:42:21.360]  This is this is really why it's such a threat.
[1:42:21.360 --> 1:42:26.360]  Because we're not talking about building a future of prosperity.
[1:42:26.360 --> 1:42:32.360]  We're not talking about building a future on innovation and technology and expansion and consciousness.
[1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:35.360]  No, it's gay.
[1:42:35.360 --> 1:42:37.360]  What the future is all about?
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:39.360]  Where do I put my private parts?
[1:42:39.360 --> 1:42:42.360]  And how do I use my private parts for pleasure?
[1:42:42.360 --> 1:42:44.360]  And that makes them feel good.
[1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:48.360]  You, a normal person, see civilization collapsing around you.
[1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:57.360]  Them, a demented freak show says, well, at least we're all going to be gay and having sex.
[1:42:57.360 --> 1:43:02.360]  A lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find out of the thousands of great items
[1:43:02.360 --> 1:43:05.360]  at m4store.com, all the storeable food.
[1:43:05.360 --> 1:43:09.360]  So we've made it easy with our great partners that supply us with the highest quality storeable food
[1:43:09.360 --> 1:43:12.360]  out there at the lowest price you're going to find for good food.

[1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:22.360]  and what is already unfolding with global food shortages.
[1:43:22.360 --> 1:43:27.360]  I told you over two years ago, the global is going to have massive inflation and food shortages
[1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:29.360]  and it's happened just like clockwork.
[1:43:29.360 --> 1:43:32.360]  And I'm telling you, it's going to get a lot worse.
[1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:33.360]  They have designed this.
[1:43:33.360 --> 1:43:38.360]  The way to beat them is to buy food now before your dollar is even more devalued.
[1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:43.360]  We're ready to ship to you right now at PrepareToday.com
[1:43:43.360 --> 1:43:46.360]  and not just storeable food, hundreds of the highest quality,
[1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:51.360]  survival and preparedness items in stock at low prices ready to ship to you right now
[1:43:51.360 --> 1:43:53.360]  at PrepareToday.com.
[1:43:53.360 --> 1:43:57.360]  You can also use the URL PrepareWithAlex.com and it takes you there.
[1:43:57.360 --> 1:43:58.360]  Take action.
[1:43:58.360 --> 1:44:05.360]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[1:44:05.360 --> 1:44:11.360]  Not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[1:44:11.360 --> 1:44:16.360]  It's a real study of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design.
[1:44:16.360 --> 1:44:22.360]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:25.360]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment,
[1:44:25.360 --> 1:44:29.360]  the sound of the Bilderberg group, the trilateral commission of the United Nations,
[1:44:29.360 --> 1:44:32.360]  the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[1:44:32.360 --> 1:44:38.360]  Until ten years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media of the Bilderberg group didn't exist.
[1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:43.360]  The Bilderberg group is public and its former head, the Silver String Committee, is called Schwab
[1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:46.360]  and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[1:44:46.360 --> 1:44:51.360]  And if, as a Liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head-on
[1:44:51.360 --> 1:44:55.360]  about the second-tier worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[1:44:55.360 --> 1:44:57.360]  We do expose them, we can beat them easily.
[1:44:57.360 --> 1:45:01.360]  I want to take a minute out to address the viewers and listeners of M4 Wars
[1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:05.360]  and to remind you that we've been vindicated and that world government
[1:45:05.360 --> 1:45:09.360]  and its tyrannical aim of depopulation is now out of the open.
[1:45:09.360 --> 1:45:13.360]  Everything you and I have done together has been distorted.
[1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:16.360]  And we cannot continue in this fight without your support.
[1:45:16.360 --> 1:45:20.360]  I want to encourage you all to be part of history right now, while you still can,
[1:45:20.360 --> 1:45:25.360]  to get the third and final coin in the founding member coin series,
[1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:31.360]  the come and take it free men bear arms coins at 1776coin.com.
[1:45:31.360 --> 1:45:37.360]  In just a few days, this coin will be gone forever and you will have the coin in your possession
[1:45:37.360 --> 1:45:43.360]  and know you helped M4 Wars stay on air at the most critical time in our 28-year history.
[1:45:43.360 --> 1:45:47.360]  So I want to thank you all for your support and I want to encourage you all to be part of history
[1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:53.360]  and to get this historic memento that keeps us on air at M4WarStore.com
[1:45:53.360 --> 1:45:56.360]  or 1776coin.com while you still can.
[1:45:56.360 --> 1:46:00.360]  M4 Wars has made history.
[1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:03.360]  You have made history in your support of M4 Wars.
[1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:08.360]  And one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the censors has been
[1:46:08.360 --> 1:46:12.360]  patriot, apparel, so we can identify each other, so we can spread the word,
[1:46:12.360 --> 1:46:15.360]  and so we can push people to websites like M4Wars.com
[1:46:15.360 --> 1:46:18.360]  so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:22.360]  Now ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts,
[1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:25.360]  some of which go back more than 25 years.
[1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:28.360]  All these shirts are limited edition, they are about to be history,
[1:46:28.360 --> 1:46:31.360]  and will only exist in your closet, your drawer, or your wardrobe.
[1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:35.360]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left.
[1:46:35.360 --> 1:46:38.360]  In a couple weeks they'll all be gone and they'll be history.
[1:46:38.360 --> 1:46:42.360]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:44.360]  So thank you all for your support.
[1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:48.360]  Please visit infowarstore.com and get one of these historic shirts,
[1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:52.360]  hoodies, long sleeves, ball caps, you name it, while you still can.
[1:46:52.360 --> 1:46:54.360]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:46:54.360 --> 1:46:57.360]  infowarstore.com
[1:46:57.360 --> 1:47:26.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:27.360 --> 1:47:34.360]  So some of the final bits and pieces of our coverage from the gay pride parades and marches
[1:47:34.360 --> 1:47:39.360]  and the grooming and everything that comes with it here in the last segment today,
[1:47:39.360 --> 1:47:41.360]  I'm going to show you.
[1:47:41.360 --> 1:47:48.360]  And then you've got a Houston parent who brought up a situation at a Houston independent school district
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:51.360]  that is not good, that is now going to be investigated.
[1:47:51.360 --> 1:47:53.360]  The Texas governor has said he's going to investigate,
[1:47:53.360 --> 1:47:56.360]  looks like some more child grooming going on in the schools there.
[1:47:56.360 --> 1:47:57.360]  So we'll have that for you too.
[1:47:57.360 --> 1:48:03.360]  And then Postmates put out perhaps the most ridiculous marketing campaign you've ever seen.
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:06.360]  And we're going to play that clip for you too here as well.
[1:48:06.360 --> 1:48:09.360]  A reminder, folks, Harrison Smith taking over after this.
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:11.360]  He's going to take your phone calls.
[1:48:11.360 --> 1:48:13.360]  He's got a bunch of news coverage for himself.
[1:48:13.360 --> 1:48:19.360]  And remember, everything we do here is brought to you by you supporting us at infowarstore.com.
[1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:22.360]  But I have to tell you about Prepare Today again, folks.
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:26.360]  I'm telling you, if you don't have emergency food supply, you're probably starting to think about it.
[1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:30.360]  You're probably starting to have the instinct to get an emergency food supply.
[1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:33.360]  PrepareToday.com is the source.
[1:48:33.360 --> 1:48:35.360]  And people are realizing it.
[1:48:35.360 --> 1:48:40.360]  And we're already selling out of some of the packages we have there at PrepareToday.com.
[1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:44.360]  So get to PrepareToday.com to get your emergency food supply.

[1:48:57.360 --> 1:48:58.360]  What about air filtration?
[1:48:58.360 --> 1:48:59.360]  What about water filtration?
[1:48:59.360 --> 1:49:01.360]  What about other survivor gear needs?
[1:49:01.360 --> 1:49:04.360]  All of it at PrepareToday.com.
[1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:08.360]  And your support there will support the transmission.
[1:49:08.360 --> 1:49:10.360]  All right.
[1:49:10.360 --> 1:49:16.360]  Here is some of the last stuff from some of the events from over the weekend.
[1:49:16.360 --> 1:49:21.360]  What they're doing to your children at these drag shows, these Pride events, clip 14.
[1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:30.360]  And of course, it's the Drag Queen for Kids Dancer, leading children in a march.
[1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:33.360]  Very illustrative, isn't it?
[1:49:33.360 --> 1:49:36.360]  Satan leading lambs to the slaughter?
[1:49:36.360 --> 1:49:38.360]  Yes, in many ways indeed.
[1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:43.360]  And quite literally, when you talk about the genital mutilation,
[1:49:43.360 --> 1:49:54.360]  that they recommend for these children and promote for these children.
[1:49:54.360 --> 1:49:56.360]  Simply incredible.
[1:49:56.360 --> 1:49:57.360]  All right.
[1:49:57.360 --> 1:49:59.360]  Now, listen to this Houston parent.
[1:49:59.360 --> 1:50:04.360]  I believe this is either a school board meeting hearing or a city council hearing.
[1:50:04.360 --> 1:50:11.360]  I can't tell, but either way, Governor Abbott has said he is directing the Texas Education System to investigate this story.
[1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:16.360]  Houston parent claims one of the teachers takes his kids to an adult drag show.
[1:50:16.360 --> 1:50:18.360]  Here it is in clip 19.
[1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:22.360]  My son attended some Houston MSDC.
[1:50:22.360 --> 1:50:27.360]  His teacher, Mr. Patrick Peetler, he was his chemistry teacher.
[1:50:27.360 --> 1:50:32.360]  He was also a writer for About Magazine and LGTVQ Magazine.
[1:50:32.360 --> 1:50:41.360]  He published an article with a lot of students and a lot of students without authorization.
[1:50:41.360 --> 1:50:43.360]  He recruited my son.
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:49.360]  He also took my son to a drag show when he was underage.
[1:50:49.360 --> 1:50:54.360]  He took him to a drag show when he was underage and it was really bad.
[1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:57.360]  It was a really bad experience.
[1:50:57.360 --> 1:51:04.360]  He also put him next to this sex offender or he was out there with my son.
[1:51:04.360 --> 1:51:10.360]  There's a lot of stuff that nothing got done.
[1:51:10.360 --> 1:51:13.360]  I have a lot of info, a lot of videos, text messages.
[1:51:13.360 --> 1:51:17.360]  Police, HSD has a lot of messages.
[1:51:17.360 --> 1:51:18.360]  It was really bad.
[1:51:18.360 --> 1:51:27.360]  Here's some of it.
[1:51:27.360 --> 1:51:29.360]  An eight-year-old boy.
[1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:31.360]  Here's how it is, folks.
[1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:36.360]  A lot of these drag queen performers might not be the bad guy.
[1:51:36.360 --> 1:51:42.360]  They might be innocent enough just into their thing and they get invited to go do this stuff and they figure it's innocent enough.
[1:51:42.360 --> 1:51:50.360]  There are those out there that are predators and there are those out there that have friends that are predators.
[1:51:50.360 --> 1:52:04.360]  You're just seeing this inappropriate, this adult-themed drag show that an educator took his eight-year-old boy to here on the screen in front of me now.
[1:52:04.360 --> 1:52:10.360]  The governor has said he's going to investigate this.
[1:52:10.360 --> 1:52:15.360]  We'll see how that goes, but that's what they do.
[1:52:15.360 --> 1:52:19.360]  There's a small percentage of people involved in this that may be innocent enough.
[1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:22.360]  The people organizing it at the top, they know exactly what they're doing.
[1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:24.360]  They know why they're targeting the kids.
[1:52:24.360 --> 1:52:34.360]  There's always a friend or a colleague that they bring in later on in the process that happens to be a pedophile.
[1:52:34.360 --> 1:52:43.360]  Either convicted multiple times, prostitute, a drug dealer, a child porn distributor, every single time.
[1:52:43.360 --> 1:52:45.360]  Oh, yeah, we're doing drag queen for kids.
[1:52:45.360 --> 1:52:51.360]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, they bring them all in and then they invite their little friend over who's got that pedophile background.
[1:52:51.360 --> 1:52:52.360]  And it just keeps happening.
[1:52:52.360 --> 1:52:56.360]  Now, this is Postmates.
[1:52:56.360 --> 1:52:58.360]  And I believe Postmates is like a food delivery service.
[1:52:58.360 --> 1:53:00.360]  I've never used Postmates.
[1:53:00.360 --> 1:53:01.360]  Guys, am I right about that?
[1:53:01.360 --> 1:53:03.360]  It's a food delivery service.
[1:53:03.360 --> 1:53:07.360]  And it's probably one of the bigger ones, I would imagine.
[1:53:07.360 --> 1:53:09.360]  It's one of the bigger ones.
[1:53:09.360 --> 1:53:11.360]  Probably not after this, though.
[1:53:11.360 --> 1:53:14.360]  This has to be one of the oddest marketing campaigns.
[1:53:14.360 --> 1:53:21.360]  And by the way, they've been very active on their social media accounts with this as well.
[1:53:21.360 --> 1:53:24.360]  Like here, here's a post from them.
[1:53:24.360 --> 1:53:28.360]  We're tired of heterosexual sex being the main focus of sexual education.
[1:53:28.360 --> 1:53:35.360]  Homosexual sex, specifically bottoming, is all too often omitted and stigmatized, not this year, happy pride.
[1:53:35.360 --> 1:53:37.360]  That's because there's nothing biological about that.
[1:53:37.360 --> 1:53:41.360]  Heterosexual sex is the biological reproductive system.
[1:53:41.360 --> 1:53:44.360]  That's why it's taught, because that's what it is.
[1:53:44.360 --> 1:53:52.360]  Sticking your wee wee in the exit is not biological and nothing to be proud of.
[1:53:52.360 --> 1:53:57.360]  I mean, I'm sorry, man.
[1:53:57.360 --> 1:53:58.360]  I just can't help myself.
[1:53:58.360 --> 1:54:00.360]  I was going to make a really disgusting joke.
[1:54:00.360 --> 1:54:02.360]  But I'm going to withhold.
[1:54:02.360 --> 1:54:03.360]  I'm going to stop.
[1:54:03.360 --> 1:54:10.360]  So here's Postmates letting its users know what foods that they can eat that are good for bottoming,
[1:54:10.360 --> 1:54:14.360]  a.k.a. anal sex.
[1:54:14.360 --> 1:54:16.360]  Eating this pride.
[1:54:16.360 --> 1:54:21.360]  Well, if you're a top, it seems like you can eat whatever you want.
[1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:25.360]  But if you're a bottom, you're expected to start.
[1:54:25.360 --> 1:54:27.360]  Not this pride.
[1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:28.360]  You know what, guys?
[1:54:28.360 --> 1:54:30.360]  Postmates restart it, because here they say,
[1:54:30.360 --> 1:54:33.360]  oh, if you're a top, you can eat whatever you want, but not if you're a bottom.
[1:54:33.360 --> 1:54:38.360]  Let me actually give you the actual science.
[1:54:38.360 --> 1:54:42.360]  If you're not having anal sex, you're good to go.
[1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:47.360]  If no one's sticking it in your exit, you're going to be quite all right.
[1:54:47.360 --> 1:54:51.360]  So no, it has nothing to do with topping or bottoming.
[1:54:51.360 --> 1:54:57.360]  If you don't want to worry about getting poop on you,
[1:54:57.360 --> 1:54:59.360]  don't have anal sex.
[1:54:59.360 --> 1:55:02.360]  Don't put your wee-wee in the poop hole.
[1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:05.360]  See, they're going to, oh, oh, it's so unfortunate for bottoms.
[1:55:05.360 --> 1:55:09.360]  They don't know what they can do, because you know what happens with the,
[1:55:09.360 --> 1:55:12.360]  so we're going to try to give you guys food that you can eat,
[1:55:12.360 --> 1:55:14.360]  because you're so discriminated against.
[1:55:14.360 --> 1:55:15.360]  All right, play it again.
[1:55:15.360 --> 1:55:17.360]  I will shut up.
[1:55:17.360 --> 1:55:19.360]  What are you eating this pride?
[1:55:19.360 --> 1:55:24.360]  Well, if you're a top, it seems like you can eat whatever you want.
[1:55:24.360 --> 1:55:26.360]  Yeah, if you're not having anal sex, you're good to go.
[1:55:26.360 --> 1:55:29.360]  If you're a bottom, you're expected to starve.
[1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:30.360]  Not this pride.
[1:55:30.360 --> 1:55:34.360]  Introducing the bottom-friendly menu of Postmates.
[1:55:34.360 --> 1:55:37.360]  We teamed up with Dr. Evan Goldstein from Bespoke Surgical
[1:55:37.360 --> 1:55:41.360]  to bring you a menu of bottom-friendly foods backed by science.
[1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:44.360]  Insoluble fiber won't help you feel cute,
[1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:49.360]  so avoid things like whole grains, wheat bran, cauliflower, potatoes, legumes.
[1:55:49.360 --> 1:55:50.360]  Hold up.
[1:55:50.360 --> 1:55:54.360]  Are you just fully diving into those beans?
[1:55:54.360 --> 1:55:57.360]  The problem with these foods is they don't dissolve in water,
[1:55:57.360 --> 1:56:00.360]  which could cause a traffic jam in your digestive system,
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:02.360]  making a mess of your evening.
[1:56:02.360 --> 1:56:06.360]  Speaking of messy, it's a good idea to avoid dairy.
[1:56:06.360 --> 1:56:08.360]  I cannot handle my toast right now.
[1:56:08.360 --> 1:56:10.360]  Look at her.
[1:56:10.360 --> 1:56:13.360]  If you're going to eat something insoluble,
[1:56:13.360 --> 1:56:18.360]  give your body about 24 hours to process all of it.
[1:56:18.360 --> 1:56:23.360]  Soluble fibers and protein are the key to having some good, clean fun.
[1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:26.360]  These all digest easily and slowly while feeding your gut.
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:28.360]  What's that clean fun you're talking about, Postmates?
[1:56:28.360 --> 1:56:30.360]  Why don't you say it?
[1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:32.360]  Why don't you just say it?
[1:56:32.360 --> 1:56:35.360]  There's no right or wrong way to bottom, but if you're planning on getting...
[1:56:35.360 --> 1:56:37.360]  Oh, it's all wrong. Believe me.
[1:56:37.360 --> 1:56:39.360]  The bottom-friendly menu on Postmates has the kinds of foods
[1:56:39.360 --> 1:56:41.360]  that could keep you feeling good.
[1:56:41.360 --> 1:56:43.360]  Organic.
[1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:52.360]  And then they do all their leftist promotion,
[1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:54.360]  leftist promotion at the end of it.
[1:56:59.360 --> 1:57:02.360]  I'm sorry, it's just so ridiculous.
[1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:08.360]  We do entire ad campaigns
[1:57:08.360 --> 1:57:11.360]  for people that are about to go get their butts plugged.
[1:57:14.360 --> 1:57:16.360]  Wow, Biden's America, folks.
[1:57:16.360 --> 1:57:18.360]  Postmates.
[1:57:18.360 --> 1:57:20.360]  How's their stock looking after that?
[1:57:20.360 --> 1:57:22.360]  Do they have stock options?
[1:57:22.360 --> 1:57:24.360]  My guess is it's tanking.
[1:57:24.360 --> 1:57:26.360]  My guess is it's bottoming out.
[1:57:26.360 --> 1:57:28.360]  You know what I mean?
[1:57:28.360 --> 1:57:30.360]  All right, there you go, folks.
[1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:34.360]  There you go. If you're worried about keeping your crap in your britches,
[1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:37.360]  call Postmates for when...
[1:57:37.360 --> 1:57:42.360]  You know, your little friend with a rat tail shows up for your orgy.
[1:57:42.360 --> 1:58:08.360]  All right, liberals, gay pride. It's all fun.
[1:58:12.360 --> 1:58:16.360]  I've been claus Schwab said last week that they rule the Earth,
[1:58:16.360 --> 1:58:18.360]  the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group.
[1:58:18.360 --> 1:58:21.360]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[1:58:21.360 --> 1:58:24.360]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[1:58:24.360 --> 1:58:26.360]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:58:26.360 --> 1:58:28.360]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[1:58:28.360 --> 1:58:30.360]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth
[1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:32.360]  and your prayer and your financial support
[1:58:32.360 --> 1:58:35.360]  because without you, info wars would not be here.
[1:58:35.360 --> 1:58:38.360]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war
[1:58:38.360 --> 1:58:41.360]  and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:58:41.360 --> 1:58:44.360]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done
[1:58:44.360 --> 1:59:13.360]  and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[1:59:14.360 --> 1:59:16.360]  Thank you so much for watching.
[1:59:44.360 --> 1:59:54.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
