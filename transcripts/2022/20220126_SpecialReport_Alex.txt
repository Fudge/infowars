[00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:05.496]  And welcome back to this live Wednesday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:05.656 --> 00:00:06.717]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:07.318 --> 00:00:17.871]  We're about to dive into something that is of paramount importance and is an issue that I hammer home every day because it is one of the main keys of victory and destiny.
[00:00:18.712 --> 00:00:20.253]  We have to know who our enemies are.
[00:00:21.094 --> 00:00:31.282]  We have to understand who the globalists are and what their plans for us are and how they brag in hundreds of books they've written and thousands of articles that I've personally read.
[00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:42.352]  I'm sure there's thousands more I haven't read about how we're idiots and how we need to be depopulated and how they've taken control of society and civilization through the corporations.
[00:00:43.345 --> 00:00:55.270]  And if we simply identify these people and realize from their own words and deeds, because they're not boasting, that they are the authors of 90% or more of the world's problems.
[00:00:56.195 --> 00:00:58.856]  Now, an example of this is Klaus Schwab.
[00:00:59.776 --> 00:01:00.956]  He's the central example of it.
[00:01:01.637 --> 00:01:32.008]   If you go to the Wikipedia page, it has a link to the Davos Group with him bragging about, three years ago, seizing control of, quote, democracies by penetrating them and infiltrating them and whining and dining and paying off young leaders, in many cases at the college level and up, by the thousands every year around the world, using intelligence agency tactics To then embed them as spies inside first local, state, and then federal governments.
[00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:42.035]  And then these international organizations like the IMF, the World Bank, the UN through the Davos Group can direct a top-down takeover.
[00:01:43.216 --> 00:01:54.876]   By the very top of the world system, this unelected authoritarian Going and recruiting and getting all the people elected and put in positions in the local state and national governments.
[00:01:55.296 --> 00:01:58.000]  This is how you capture a civilization.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.323]  This is what has happened to us.
[00:02:00.403 --> 00:02:05.990]  And I understand our amazing audience is sitting there saying, Alex, we knew this before you were born.
[00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:10.045]  Or a lot of you are like, yeah Alex, we tuned in 20 years ago, we know, we checked, we know it's true.
[00:02:10.546 --> 00:02:11.447]  Why are you telling us again?
[00:02:12.108 --> 00:02:15.212]  Because the general public still doesn't know.
[00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:24.905]  And I talk to top lawyers and top bank owners and top talk show hosts all the time and spend 10-15 minutes showing them clips about Klaus Schwab and the UN.
[00:02:25.505 --> 00:02:38.191]  And the Davos Group, and the Bilderberg Group, and the Club of Rome, and British Intelligence, and Carol Quigley, and Cecil Rhodes, and explaining how it all works, and boom, they wake up, they understand it, they're off and running, and then they're now not exposing it.
[00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:49.196]  So we've gone from almost nobody knowing about this 25 years ago, to a large portion of folks getting it, and we're very, very close to identifying it and stopping it dead in its tracks.
[00:02:49.756 --> 00:03:01.479]   Now a new piece of video has emerged From the Harvard Kennedy School with the globalist New World Order operative David Gergen interviewing Klaus Schwab.
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.182]  At the Kennedy School, which is again one of these big globalist organizations.
[00:03:06.542 --> 00:03:08.503]  So you have a real Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:03:08.603 --> 00:03:10.585]  fighting the Great Reset Agenda.
[00:03:11.205 --> 00:03:23.172]  And then you've got something bearing his brother's name, and it's absolutely captured by the organization, a multinational group that undoubtedly ran the murder of the man whose name they've now stolen.
[00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:24.452]  It's just too rich.
[00:03:24.532 --> 00:03:28.415]  But getting back to the video clip you're about to see, it's only a minute and 15 seconds long.
[00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:36.701]  We're going to link in the live show feed of Infowars.com the full hour-long discussion so you can go watch for yourself because there's stuff just as bad in it.
[00:03:36.981 --> 00:03:45.629]  But here is Klaus Schwab admitting what he says in the Wikipedia entries on television in front of a crowd of people on C-SPAN.
[00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:51.533]  Here he is saying that their alumni, including Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin, oh you didn't know that?
[00:03:52.034 --> 00:04:04.598]   Including the Prime Minister of New Zealand, the Prime Minister of Canada, the President of France, All of them went to the Bilderberg School, the Davos Young Global Leader School.
[00:04:05.218 --> 00:04:09.760]  Now, obviously, anybody wanting to get powerful, anybody wanting to get ahead, wants to go be part of this feeder group.
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.061]  And I'm not saying everybody that's gone is evil.
[00:04:12.621 --> 00:04:14.102]  Tulsi Gabbards went to it.
[00:04:14.742 --> 00:04:15.442]  Dan Crenshaw.
[00:04:15.923 --> 00:04:34.590]  But the point is is that we should be aware of this and understand this and understand that what Klaus Schwab set up with Henry Kissinger is only a more modern model of what the British roundtable groups started setting up in places like India 250 years ago for the British East India Company that then spread around the world.
[00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:46.354]   And that is these organizations and groups that go and recruit the locals and roundtable groups That are controlled by like a central agent in the middle that operate like a British intelligence operation because it is a British intelligence operation.
[00:04:46.394 --> 00:04:47.494]  That's the model of it.
[00:04:47.674 --> 00:04:49.435]  And Carol Quigley and many others wrote books about it.
[00:04:49.495 --> 00:04:50.255]  Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[00:04:50.715 --> 00:04:52.796]  This is not a secret in the intelligentsia.
[00:04:53.216 --> 00:05:02.959]  And we have to be adults and know the playbook and know what we're up against and realize these globalist would-be controllers are very evil and don't even want you to be alive.
[00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:05.780]  That's their ideology, is to destroy you.
[00:05:06.637 --> 00:05:09.995]   to enslave you and suck everything you've got out of you and then destroy you.
[00:05:09.995 --> 00:05:13.596]   That's why they've got to be opposed. So here's this short, extremely powerful clip.
[00:05:13.596 --> 00:05:15.117]  We're going to come back with more.
[00:05:16.076 --> 00:05:24.675]   When I mention our names like Mrs. Merkel, even Vladimir Putin and so on, they all have been young global leaders of
[00:05:24.675 --> 00:05:27.117]  the world economic forum.
[00:05:27.117 --> 00:05:27.956]  Mm-hmm.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:43.166]   But what we are very proud of now is the young generation like Prime Minister Trudeau, President of Argentina and so on, That we penetrate the cabinets.
[00:05:43.807 --> 00:06:03.839]  So yesterday I was at a reception for Prime Minister Trudeau and I would know that half of this cabinet or even more half of this cabinet are actually young global leaders of the world economy.
[00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:05.569]  That's true in Argentina as well.
[00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.571]  It's true in Argentina, and it's true in France now.
[00:06:09.731 --> 00:06:19.174]  I'm here with the president, with the young global leader, but... If you're live, we've linked to it again at InfoWars.com in the live show feed area.
[00:06:19.194 --> 00:06:22.795]  You can go watch this for yourself, where he's describing their alumni.
[00:06:23.755 --> 00:06:34.364]  Not just being the Prime Ministers and Presidents, but having the majority of the cabinets being their people and being believers in the transhumanism world government depopulation agenda.
[00:06:34.584 --> 00:06:35.364]  This is a death code.
[00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:51.658]  And that's why whether it's Merkel, or whether it is Macron, or whether it is Leonardo DiCaprio, they're all graduates, they tell you the world's ending in 2030 because they plan to trigger events to blame on the general public and global warming that lead to that depopulation.
[00:06:52.398 --> 00:06:54.420]  So that's why I'm so desperate to warn you about this.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:06.928]  Now let's go back to 2004 and a short clip from one of my documentaries, where we run into David Gergen on the streets of New York at the RNC and bring up Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove.
[00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:11.151]  That is the sexual side of this and that binds them together in the cult.
[00:07:11.752 --> 00:07:17.496]  So here's a few minutes from 9-1-1, martial law, and then we'll go back to Owen Schroeder in a live broadcast.
[00:07:17.516 --> 00:07:19.237]  And I hope you research all this yourself and share it.
[00:07:19.741 --> 00:07:24.743]  While in New York, we ran into the Karl Rove of four administrations.
[00:07:25.304 --> 00:07:33.268]  David Gergen, top presidential advisor to Ford, Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush, and Bill Clinton.
[00:07:34.088 --> 00:07:43.413]  We're talking to David Gergen and he has advised several presidents and of course has written quite a few books and is a, I would call you a political pundit or researcher?
[00:07:44.373 --> 00:07:45.874]  Commentary at Over the Hill, whatever.
[00:07:46.394 --> 00:07:47.415]  What do you think of this circus?
[00:07:48.254 --> 00:07:52.518]  Well, I haven't seen all the protests yet, but I've never seen as much security for a convention as we have here.
[00:07:52.818 --> 00:07:58.362]  There's been a lot of news articles and reports saying that there's a heightened risk of terror attacks.
[00:07:58.522 --> 00:08:00.904]  Do you think there's a chance of that?
[00:08:01.485 --> 00:08:02.846]  Yeah, I think it's very real danger.
[00:08:04.487 --> 00:08:11.949]  Madison Square Garden is sitting right, you know, basically on top of a train station, and Boston Convention was right on top of a train station.
[00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:15.870]  Yeah, I just have to remember that trains are very accessible, vulnerable.
[00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.350]  One last question.
[00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:27.673]  I read a Washington Times article many years ago where you had a comment about the organization, and then now it's been in the Wall Street Journal, it's been in a lot of different newspapers, and that's the Bohemian Grove.
[00:08:28.073 --> 00:08:28.874]  And back in, what was it, 19...
[00:08:30.994 --> 00:08:35.798]  In 1996, when you joined as a Clinton advisor, the Republicans were criticizing you.
[00:08:35.918 --> 00:08:37.019]  Oh, what about Bohemian Grove?
[00:08:37.139 --> 00:08:39.741]  And then you countered them by saying, hey, I don't run around in the woods naked.
[00:08:39.781 --> 00:08:41.443]  What did that mean?
[00:08:41.743 --> 00:08:43.344]  I don't know what quote you're referring to.
[00:08:43.364 --> 00:08:44.686]  I'm not aware of any quote like that.
[00:08:45.506 --> 00:08:51.031]  Listen, I am a happy member of the Bohemian Grove.
[00:08:51.071 --> 00:08:52.712]  I like the folks who come there.
[00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:58.357]  And it's really inappropriate for me to talk about the group beyond that.
[00:08:59.617 --> 00:09:02.140]  Have you been there for the ceremony with the cremation of Kerr?
[00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:10.421]   frankly, I don't think that's something I need to talk to you about.
[00:09:10.421 --> 00:09:24.460]  I'm Alex Jones and I snuck in there in 2000.
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.821]  I'm the guy that blew it wide open and got the video.
[00:09:26.841 --> 00:09:27.902]  It's been on national TV.
[00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:29.422]  Well, I disrespect you for that.
[00:09:29.863 --> 00:09:30.163]  You do?
[00:09:30.343 --> 00:09:30.563]  I do.
[00:09:30.583 --> 00:09:32.984]  But it's a lot of big public officials going in there.
[00:09:33.204 --> 00:09:34.865]  Don't we deserve to know?
[00:09:34.885 --> 00:09:37.066]  I don't know anything about you and I don't know anything about your film.
[00:09:37.386 --> 00:09:41.568]  But if you go in there with an understanding, you violated that understanding by releasing that film and I don't respect you for that.
[00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:42.476]  Really?
[00:09:43.477 --> 00:09:47.540]  I'm sorry, you took an understanding when you went in there that you would not do that film.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.041]  Did you have an understanding when you went in there?
[00:09:49.461 --> 00:09:49.662]  No.
[00:09:49.882 --> 00:09:50.522]  Did you crash it?
[00:09:50.903 --> 00:09:51.103]  Yes.
[00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:53.444]  Yeah, and it has no trespassing signs there too, doesn't it?
[00:09:53.464 --> 00:09:54.445]  No, they put them up after.
[00:09:54.885 --> 00:09:55.466]  I just walked in.
[00:09:55.586 --> 00:09:56.947]  I'm sorry, sir, I've been there before.
[00:09:56.987 --> 00:10:01.370]  I know what the circumstances are, and I'm sorry you violated the understandings.
[00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.751]  That was not a gentlemanly thing to do.
[00:10:02.771 --> 00:10:03.592]  But what about the ritual?
[00:10:03.431 --> 00:10:05.431]  Is the ritual gentlemanly?
[00:10:05.431 --> 00:10:12.431]  [Cheering]
[00:10:12.431 --> 00:10:16.431]  Sir, everything... I don't owe you this comment.
[00:10:16.707 --> 00:10:18.430]  I know, I appreciate it.
[00:10:18.471 --> 00:10:22.337]  This is what's called ambush journalism, and I disrespect you for that as well, so thank you and goodbye.
[00:10:22.357 --> 00:10:23.259]  Have you ever been in the original?
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.243]  That's none of your damn business.
[00:10:26.008 --> 00:10:27.530]  Oh, great.
[00:10:28.111 --> 00:10:29.173]  Listen, listen.
[00:10:29.854 --> 00:10:33.519]  You go around and make understandings with people and violate them.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.646]  You ambush people on the streets, and that's an inappropriate form of journalism.
[00:10:38.846 --> 00:10:42.150]  If you wish to practice that, that's fine, but don't ask others to respect you for it.
[00:10:43.052 --> 00:10:45.413]  You can do your Free American like anything you want.
[00:10:45.693 --> 00:10:48.814]  If you want to be uncivil and rude and ungentlemanly, that's up to you.
[00:10:49.074 --> 00:10:52.114]  But don't expect the rest of us to say, oh well, you're... You guys are setting policy in there, Mr. Gergen.
[00:10:52.194 --> 00:10:53.915]  I'm sorry, nobody sets policy in there.
[00:10:54.175 --> 00:10:55.675]  We try to be gentlemen.
[00:10:55.975 --> 00:10:57.656]  And obviously, you don't belong there.
[00:10:57.676 --> 00:10:58.936]  Weaving spiders coming out here?
[00:11:01.457 --> 00:11:01.997]  Yeah!
[00:11:02.377 --> 00:11:04.258]  That is a three-pointer!
[00:11:04.477 --> 00:11:05.477]  Woo!
[00:11:05.477 --> 00:11:07.477]  (Explosion)
[00:11:07.477 --> 00:11:11.918]  A riotous mob.
[00:11:12.405 --> 00:11:18.331]  Whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.
[00:11:18.351 --> 00:11:19.031]  Insurrection.
[00:11:19.372 --> 00:11:22.635]  We will follow the facts wherever they lead.
[00:11:22.655 --> 00:11:23.776]  Domestic terrorists.
[00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:28.069]  The days of independent media are numbered.
[00:11:28.369 --> 00:11:30.811]  The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:33.912]  They are now debanking us behind the scenes.
[00:11:34.352 --> 00:11:37.374]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:42.757]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps.
[00:11:43.297 --> 00:11:45.818]  The traitors know they can shut us down by force.
[00:11:46.579 --> 00:11:49.140]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:50.301]  So be it.
[00:11:51.261 --> 00:11:53.022]  Make them silence us by force.
[00:11:53.662 --> 00:11:56.123]  This is the final battle of the information war.
[00:11:56.663 --> 00:11:57.303]  Give now.
[00:11:57.963 --> 00:11:58.804]  Buy products.

[00:12:00.644 --> 00:12:01.885]  Before everything changes.
[00:12:02.485 --> 00:12:04.845]  We need you to carry us through to the end.
[00:12:05.306 --> 00:12:06.226]  Victory or death.
