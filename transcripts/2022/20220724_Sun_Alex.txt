[00:00.000 --> 00:09.720]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:09.720 --> 00:19.280]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:19.280 --> 00:25.680]  all right we've got a very special Sunday evening version or type of broadcast
[00:25.680 --> 00:30.320]  they're always informative they're always important but tonight we're gonna
[00:30.320 --> 00:36.400]  have several special guests in studio in the third and fourth hour Ali Alexander
[00:36.400 --> 00:47.520]  Eddie Bravo Harrison Smith will also be co-hosting that is coming up tonight but
[00:47.520 --> 00:54.440]  the planet's really aligned with political crossover in the populous
[00:54.440 --> 01:02.920]  free speech sphere on Saturday I was interviewed by Steve Bannon it was very
[01:02.920 --> 01:05.400]  very gracious and I think did a great job brought a lot of really important
[01:05.400 --> 01:10.280]  points basically a full endorsement of info wars and some pretty amazing
[01:10.280 --> 01:14.600]  statements we're gonna be airing a large part of that hour-long interview in this
[01:14.600 --> 01:22.160]  hour and then in the second hour it was on Rockfinn at the Alex's War premiere
[01:22.160 --> 01:27.920]  with Glenn Greenwald Alex Moyer and myself that's a streaming service we're
[01:27.920 --> 01:33.280]  gonna play about half the interview we'll find the rest at Rockfinn coming up in
[01:33.280 --> 01:38.320]  the second hour today and that's Glenn Greenwald interviewing me and it was
[01:38.320 --> 01:45.280]  pretty powerful and we're also on the eve of this kangaroo court trial of one
[01:45.280 --> 01:49.440]  of three that starts in Austin tomorrow the Democratic Party in their anti-gun
[01:49.440 --> 01:55.080]  movement using the Sandy Hook folks is there as they're foiled and they're
[01:55.080 --> 01:58.800]  admitted plan to try to bankrupt us and silence doesn't take us off the air and
[01:58.800 --> 02:03.880]  then use that model to get everybody else's speech we're on the eve of that
[02:03.880 --> 02:10.080]  unfolding and just to be there and and and to be talking about the attack on
[02:10.080 --> 02:13.800]  free speech not just here but worldwide and then to see of the deep-states
[02:13.800 --> 02:19.200]  activities against me it doesn't make me mad that they're doing this to me
[02:19.200 --> 02:23.880]  I know it's designed for everybody else and they admit it is and just to see the
[02:23.880 --> 02:29.360]  media and the judges in the system working in concert to say you can't
[02:29.360 --> 02:31.680]  talk about the First Amendment you're already guilty when we have this trial
[02:31.680 --> 02:35.040]  you can't say you're innocent well I mean a guy found with dead bodies can say
[02:35.040 --> 02:38.800]  he's innocent you will not tell the jury you're innocent this is an order you
[02:38.800 --> 02:45.680]  will not mention the First Amendment you won't tell them your bankrupt you won't
[02:45.680 --> 02:49.400]  tell them any this so they don't know anything they're just told he's guilty
[02:49.400 --> 02:54.080]  now we're going to tell you how guilty he is that is beyond even like North
[02:54.080 --> 03:02.640]  Korea that's beyond Venezuela I mean this is just ridiculous if they bother
[03:02.640 --> 03:07.400]  to have a trial in Venezuela North Korea then they at least put on some show
[03:07.400 --> 03:09.640]  usually they just take you out back and shoot you in the back of the head but
[03:09.640 --> 03:13.880]  that's where all this is going and this is a stuff that happened early on in
[03:13.880 --> 03:18.640]  Nazi Germany deep platforming debanking people corporations ganging up and
[03:18.640 --> 03:22.960]  taking folks out of the market then you're putting ghettos then you don't
[03:22.960 --> 03:26.280]  get trials or you don't get fair trials then you don't get trials I mean this is
[03:26.280 --> 03:30.640]  real bona fide tyranny the stuff you read about in history books you just get
[03:30.640 --> 03:34.080]  angry hearing about corrupt government like this and then you see it and it's
[03:34.080 --> 03:39.640]  weird laughing smiling leftist almost all of them women it's like oh they're
[03:39.640 --> 03:44.200]  women so they get to violate everybody's rights it's cute info oh you're
[03:44.200 --> 03:47.560]  convicted pedophile but you dress up like a woman so you can come into the
[03:47.560 --> 03:53.440]  public school and have five-year-olds sitting around I mean just unbelievable

[05:05.880 --> 05:11.400]  between what we've known and what's to come and right now the most important
[05:11.400 --> 05:16.760]  thing to remember is don't panic stay calm because now is the time that we
[05:16.760 --> 05:22.240]  must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe sound course there is
[05:22.240 --> 05:27.360]  nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building our
[05:27.360 --> 05:32.920]  own society all we got to do is survive the crash and right now we still have
[05:32.920 --> 05:39.040]  time to prepare the world fiat currency system is racing towards zero it's time
[05:39.040 --> 05:44.800]  to convert it into hard assets now including food water and survival gear
[05:44.800 --> 05:51.000]  to keep us strong and at the ready go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials
[05:51.000 --> 06:01.000]  storeable foods water filtration first aid power and more at preparedtoday.com
[06:10.520 --> 06:14.360]  it's a decade ago folks laughed self-driving robot cars about the
[06:14.360 --> 06:18.240]  hit Nevada highways they passed the law soon there won't be any truck drivers
[06:18.240 --> 06:23.240]  anymore there won't be any checkout lanes anymore why the future doesn't need us
[06:23.240 --> 06:28.080]  and then the technocrats they're designing the infrastructure they're
[06:28.080 --> 06:32.880]  designing the system they're designing all of it not to empower humanity and
[06:32.880 --> 06:37.760]  build up humanity the vaccines the GMO reduced fertility dumb you down they
[06:37.760 --> 06:43.120]  frame the whole thing that is a foregone conclusion that your brain will be
[06:43.120 --> 06:47.160]  transplanted in a machine and copies of it will be distributed out and death
[06:47.160 --> 06:50.520]  will be conquered they want a transhumanist new dark age for the rest
[06:50.520 --> 06:54.880]  of us turning off our resources in a post-industrial world while in high-tech
[06:54.880 --> 06:59.000]  reservations the new class system they have the advanced tech which people
[06:59.000 --> 07:05.200]  beg for like a slave med iPad like a slave created iPad made it slave factories
[07:05.200 --> 07:09.240]  with suicide nets then they give it to the so-called upper-class and Google
[07:09.240 --> 07:13.600]  believes that the first artificial intelligence will be a supercomputer
[07:13.600 --> 07:19.240]  based on the neuron activities of the hive mind of humanity and so then it's
[07:19.240 --> 07:23.640]  the end of consciousness and free will for individuals as we know and a true
[07:23.640 --> 07:28.960]  2.0 in a very bad way hive mind consciousness with an AI jacked into
[07:28.960 --> 07:31.920]  everyone knowing our hopes and dreams because we were already wired and
[07:31.920 --> 07:35.920]  absorbed before we knew it by giving over our consciousness to the system by
[07:35.920 --> 07:39.640]  our daily decisions that it was able to manipulate and control into a larger
[07:39.640 --> 07:44.320]  system the ultimate racism the ultimate anti-human globalist eugenics movement
[07:44.320 --> 07:49.240]  that says humanity's failed and over and the machines are gonna override us and
[07:49.240 --> 07:53.480]  the elite are gonna merge with silicon and that to do that they must first
[07:53.480 --> 07:59.720]  shed themselves of us the cancer the priest at Google the priest at Apple the
[07:59.720 --> 08:06.760]  priest at IBM the priest at Microsoft that is their religion I declare this
[08:06.760 --> 08:13.000]  July 4th 2022 to be a declaration of independence against the alien force on
[08:13.000 --> 08:18.160]  this planet today waging war against humans and our biology and our very
[08:18.160 --> 08:23.880]  future that is attempting to exterminate the majority of us and force the minority
[08:23.880 --> 08:31.480]  that's left to merge with AI computers and become cyborg slaves of Satan okay
[08:31.480 --> 08:36.280]  we're gonna have the the great Alex Jones on here momentarily but we want to
[08:36.280 --> 08:40.840]  take a little different cut on this there's a huge film coming out it's gonna
[08:40.840 --> 08:45.160]  premiere tonight in Austin Texas we actually have part of the team down
[08:45.160 --> 08:49.360]  there to be at the premiere and then this film's gonna be I think available on
[08:49.360 --> 08:56.920]  the 29th the tip to watch is called Alex Alex's war but there's also it as
[08:56.920 --> 09:02.160]  importantly I actually think I think for many reasons maybe even more
[09:02.160 --> 09:06.360]  importantly there's a major new book coming out by the guys over at Skyhorse
[09:06.360 --> 09:09.720]  Tony Lyons and team by Alex Jones called the great reset in the war for the
[09:09.720 --> 09:16.480]  world which is a incredible document the reason I want to start I want to bring
[09:16.480 --> 09:20.880]  in Joe Allen we're doing a short tribute to Alex Jones because here's
[09:20.880 --> 09:25.400]  thing people say Alex Jones crazy he's a conspiracy theory guys a nutcase he got
[09:25.400 --> 09:31.320]  these rants and all that what they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve
[09:31.320 --> 09:38.280]  on so many different topics of signal not noise he's one of the the the the
[09:38.280 --> 09:44.560]  the really the leaders in describing what transhumanism is it's dangerous and
[09:44.560 --> 09:47.760]  what's happening on this and we just did a short mashup we could we could have
[09:47.760 --> 09:51.600]  done a whole hour of things Joe Allen you're our editor in charge of this I
[09:51.600 --> 09:54.480]  know you're now working on a couple of projects for us that's why you're not on
[09:54.480 --> 09:58.200]  the show as frequently as you're not your daily hits anymore we're gonna get
[09:58.200 --> 10:00.960]  you back more ingrained and we understand you get a huge project you're
[10:00.960 --> 10:06.200]  working on for us tell me about Alex Jones in the in transhumanism and how
[10:06.200 --> 10:11.440]  he was a prophet about this sir well yes Steve you know as we've discussed
[10:11.440 --> 10:16.240]  before Alex Jones was raising the alarm on transhumanism long before anybody
[10:16.240 --> 10:20.760]  was paying attention or would touch it I mean yeah he has a reputation for
[10:20.760 --> 10:25.080]  throwing wild haymakers but when those haymakers connect they definitely
[10:25.080 --> 10:29.880]  crack skulls and I think that people like him whose antennas are out who are
[10:29.880 --> 10:35.680]  very sensitive to danger when he starts screaming about something I think you
[10:35.680 --> 10:40.640]  should really stop and pay attention I mean there really aren't many topics
[10:40.640 --> 10:45.640]  more terrifying than transhumanism most people will try to ignore it mainly
[10:45.640 --> 10:49.800]  because of its utter horror you're talking about merging human beings with
[10:49.800 --> 10:54.160]  machines you're talking about genetic engineering and human monkey chimeras
[10:54.160 --> 10:59.600]  brain enhancement chemicals and robots and brain implants and super human
[10:59.600 --> 11:04.120]  artificial intelligence and I would say that Alex Jones especially in regard to
[11:04.120 --> 11:10.160]  Ray Kurzweil has been pointing out all of those things as they develop so we
[11:10.160 --> 11:15.280]  may differ on the theory of the case but he has presented tons of valid evidence
[11:15.280 --> 11:20.160]  and facts that I think have been really really important to raising consciousness
[11:20.160 --> 11:26.760]  to what the sort of technocratic global elite really want to do again if you go
[11:26.760 --> 11:31.080]  back doesn't matter if you go back if you go back if you go back and look at
[11:31.080 --> 11:35.480]  the signal coin show and not the noise you look at the signal and you compare
[11:35.480 --> 11:42.320]  that to PBS and NPR and BBC let's go to the super high elite of reporting and
[11:42.320 --> 11:47.080]  you compare what they've put out over the last decade or so about this topic
[11:47.080 --> 11:50.400]  which I keep saying and the reason we got Joe Allen on here full-time is
[11:50.400 --> 11:54.320]  probably at the end of the day the most important part and this is with the
[11:54.320 --> 11:58.760]  brilliance of his new book the Great Reset Alex Jones cuts to the heart of
[11:58.760 --> 12:05.960]  the matter if you compare the finest and I'm telling you to take MIT technology
[12:05.960 --> 12:09.640]  review you take science take all these magazines and journals add the
[12:09.640 --> 12:15.120]  electronic part of it and you know NPR PBS all of it I'll take it I'll match
[12:15.120 --> 12:19.400]  up and I will go through and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus
[12:19.400 --> 12:23.840]  what your collective body has put out there and if you're a sent in a human
[12:23.840 --> 12:26.760]  being and just watching it you say we've got Alex Jones was ahead of this not
[12:26.760 --> 12:30.080]  only that he kind of explained it maybe all the pieces didn't fit together the
[12:30.080 --> 12:34.120]  other stuff is just standard stock and leaves you with nothing this is the
[12:34.120 --> 12:40.520]  importance this is a signal not noise yeah last last year we called NPR the
[12:40.520 --> 12:43.880]  whores of the techno apocalypse and I think that still stands and it
[12:43.880 --> 12:47.760]  definitely stands for the guardian who are basically promoting it and slow you
[12:47.760 --> 12:52.240]  know kind of soft peddling the implications of it CNN anytime they
[12:52.240 --> 12:55.840]  touch anything like this they just make it sound like cool new technology that
[12:55.840 --> 13:00.160]  you should look forward to yeah Alex Jones is saying pay attention and be
[13:00.160 --> 13:05.120]  afraid yeah and I think that he's done a tremendous service in that regard I want
[13:05.120 --> 13:08.240]  you to hang on let me play the cold open now I want to play the trailer for this
[13:08.240 --> 13:13.080]  film it's it's it's insane it's insanely good let's play the cold number
[13:13.080 --> 13:26.040]  reacts I'm Alex Jones the story you're about to see is truth this is reality
[13:26.040 --> 13:30.800]  Alex Jones is a fake he's a performance artist I'm perceived as a clown to nut
[13:30.800 --> 13:39.040]  maniac on his website info wars he touts Aaron Aaron Neuerborn the sickest most
[13:39.040 --> 13:44.360]  offensive theories Alex Jones claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City
[13:44.360 --> 13:49.080]  bombings were inside jobs don't you stand for America sir he said me and
[13:49.080 --> 13:58.840]  Hillary are demons I met him back in 1990 I knew right away he was gonna be a
[13:58.840 --> 14:03.280]  star I saw all the conspiracy terrorists that were talking about the new world
[14:03.280 --> 14:11.000]  order that's what I'll do was that attack on humanity I saw early on that I
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.240]  really wanted to waste war on you're lying to the public it's disgusting when
[14:14.240 --> 14:20.280]  she takes that there's no going back everything's a war that's the way the
[14:20.280 --> 14:24.360]  universe works and everything is propaganda I don't trust Donald Trump
[14:24.360 --> 14:28.920]  but I agree with probably 95% of what Donald Trump says your reputation is
[14:28.920 --> 14:35.600]  amazing I will not let you down that's when the media took the gloves off Alex
[14:35.600 --> 14:39.600]  Jones said the Sandy Hook shooting which claimed the lives of 20 children was
[14:39.600 --> 14:42.320]  fake I try to tell the truth and sometimes I'm wrong
[14:42.320 --> 14:46.480]  did the New York Times get in trouble for consciously lying about WMD's that
[14:46.480 --> 14:51.240]  then led to a war still tens of thousands of conflict no the attempts to
[14:51.240 --> 14:55.880]  platform us to fail they have the CIA the FBI following me around now we got
[14:55.880 --> 15:06.400]  to destroy Alex Jones we're not playing games here it's all just insane okay
[15:06.400 --> 15:09.600]  let's put me in prison for questioning okay even though that's my right like
[15:09.600 --> 15:13.000]  let's execute Alex Jones let's let's put in front of a firing squad pull the
[15:13.000 --> 15:22.960]  trigger I have a sick feeling actually just I know it comes next all right
[15:22.960 --> 15:31.240]  folks so we're gonna go to break and then we're going to come back with the
[15:31.240 --> 15:35.440]  rest of this a great interview with Steve Bannon I really appreciate him
[15:35.440 --> 15:38.760]  having me on he doesn't call my show soon he was of course just recently
[15:38.760 --> 15:43.960]  falsely convicted of not testifying to Congress because he had the
[15:43.960 --> 15:50.320]  presidential discretion not to do that separation of powers so that is all
[15:50.320 --> 15:55.800]  coming up ladies and gentlemen on the other side stay with us
[15:59.080 --> 16:04.120]  the globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family to destroy
[16:04.120 --> 16:08.640]  heterosexual relationships to annihilate our marriages and the studies are all
[16:08.640 --> 16:15.440]  clear the number one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the
[16:15.440 --> 16:20.440]  bedroom and the number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction ladies and
[16:20.440 --> 16:23.960]  gentlemen the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people
[16:23.960 --> 16:27.080]  having lasting good love and relationships they want to break up

[17:04.400 --> 17:08.280]  overweight I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding
[17:08.280 --> 17:12.080]  on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it so the
[17:12.080 --> 17:15.680]  first one I got was the original survival shield the X1 and it worked
[17:15.680 --> 17:19.120]  pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with X2 you have you know
[17:19.120 --> 17:22.080]  with a deep burn source you know and I got really excited about that so I took
[17:22.080 --> 17:26.880]  it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my
[17:26.880 --> 17:31.560]  brain was enlightened you know I could think again I could connect with people
[17:31.560 --> 17:35.920]  again and over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and
[17:35.920 --> 17:38.880]  I religiously take basically all of your supplements there they're all
[17:38.880 --> 17:42.720]  absolutely amazing supplements the one I like recently is a knockout it'll
[17:42.720 --> 17:46.200]  literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but
[17:46.200 --> 17:50.200]  anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean yet to break free of the
[17:50.200 --> 17:54.000]  globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our
[17:54.000 --> 17:57.720]  own hands beautifully said brother I thank you so much for your call and God
[17:57.720 --> 18:02.240]  speed I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or
[18:02.240 --> 18:05.800]  pump gas or whether you're a farmer a rancher a doctor a lawyer or a
[18:05.800 --> 18:10.200]  millionaire fortune and money magazine have all done these profiles you see it
[18:10.200 --> 18:14.200]  every year 30 different tax returns 30 different answers 50 different tax
[18:14.200 --> 18:18.840]  returns 50 different answers and almost all of them just screw you over
[18:18.840 --> 18:22.600]  especially the big firms and the big tax groups because they're part of the
[18:22.600 --> 18:25.960]  system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing
[18:25.960 --> 18:30.200]  this so it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out
[18:30.200 --> 18:35.480]  they're hurting everybody to be able to do things tax wise it's legal and
[18:35.480 --> 18:38.840]  awful that allows you to keep more your money we wouldn't even be here if I
[18:38.840 --> 18:44.440]  hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years the only way you fail is
[18:44.440 --> 18:49.800]  not writing down the url jonestaxrelief.com one word jonestaxrelief.com
[18:49.800 --> 18:58.320]  or call 833-904-285 833-904-285
[18:58.320 --> 19:05.760]  there is nothing there is no more epitome of free speech than right here and
[19:05.760 --> 19:11.240]  that's what people recognize and resonate with and as word said you're not
[19:11.240 --> 19:14.520]  going to find a better place for information you might not agree with
[19:14.520 --> 19:17.960]  everything you might not agree with all our perspectives but we cover all the
[19:17.960 --> 19:21.880]  information and there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here thank
[19:21.880 --> 19:26.520]  you for that word infowarstore.com by the way products he mentions infowar
[19:26.520 --> 19:29.920]  store.com is where to get them folks and we do have the best supplements I mean
[19:29.920 --> 19:35.880]  just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information we do the
[19:35.880 --> 19:40.320]  best with our supplements as well I mean look at the hair and beard support
[19:40.320 --> 19:45.000]  formula folks this is a joke I mean we're giving this thing away at 75% off
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.840]  by the way it works for me in case you haven't noticed the hair and beard
[19:48.840 --> 19:55.520]  formula is working for me quite well I might add quite well my barber
[19:55.520 --> 20:00.320]  appreciates hair and beard support for men I go and see him quite often now
[20:00.320 --> 20:09.000]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[20:16.680 --> 20:22.680]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming
[20:22.680 --> 20:30.000]  to you live from the front lines of the info war. Alex thank you very much for
[20:30.000 --> 20:34.000]  joining us tell us about this movie you a great filmmaker made this you're
[20:34.000 --> 20:39.840]  interviewed for it but other than that it's their film correct? It is I mean I've
[20:39.840 --> 20:43.440]  turned on a lot of other documentary offers because it's the establishment
[20:43.440 --> 20:47.560]  they always lie but I'd seen some of her films and knew that it was independent
[20:47.560 --> 20:50.800]  and it shows me in a bad light and a good light because I mean I'm a real
[20:50.800 --> 20:54.720]  person just like you but it's hard to come on here Steve because I've
[20:54.720 --> 20:59.080]  admired you and it was a brain behind a lot of what Trump was able to do and
[20:59.080 --> 21:03.160]  you've had the most courage of anybody out there standing up to this January
[21:03.160 --> 21:08.200]  6th fraud and really bringing America back so it's hard to come on your show
[21:08.200 --> 21:15.320]  and then talk about myself here it's surreal with what you did not backing
[21:15.320 --> 21:20.360]  down to the committee and them and their kangaroo court and how they wouldn't let
[21:20.360 --> 21:24.720]  you cross-examine people I'm facing three rig lawsuits run by Democrats same
[21:24.720 --> 21:29.040]  ones in Travis County that the indicted Rick Perry and Tom DeLay that I'm not
[21:29.040 --> 21:33.120]  allowed to say I'm innocent at my trial next week that starts they put an order
[21:33.120 --> 21:37.560]  out you cannot say you're innocent you cannot say it's rigged and you can I
[21:37.560 --> 21:40.880]  mean it's insane I'm supposed to sit there and not talk and not say I'm
[21:40.880 --> 21:45.200]  innocent this is the end of America so if they can destroy Steve Bannon and
[21:45.200 --> 21:48.560]  Alex Jones they can destroy you so I'm just honored and I'm not gushing here
[21:48.560 --> 21:53.920]  just a gush I mean I don't gosh I'm gushing because literally we are in the
[21:53.920 --> 21:58.000]  arena and you and I and you at a greater level I gotta say they were so
[21:58.000 --> 22:03.440]  scared of you and and so I admire your work and I have you know really really
[22:03.440 --> 22:06.680]  push people that have you know attacked you and stuff to not because they're
[22:06.680 --> 22:10.480]  wrong and when they do they're buying into the globalist propaganda so I am
[22:10.480 --> 22:14.600]  really this is a big bucket list being on your show and I'm I'm so proud of the
[22:14.600 --> 22:18.280]  fact that it's exploded and everybody talks about I'm at the grocery store I'm
[22:18.280 --> 22:23.160]  at church everywhere almost every day people go man I really love your show
[22:23.160 --> 22:25.880]  and I love Steve Bannon did you see this you see that and I don't get like
[22:25.880 --> 22:29.520]  envious I feel good I go to sleep at night like if they put me in prison or
[22:29.520 --> 22:33.520]  kill me next week at least Steve Bannon's out there and this team you put
[22:33.520 --> 22:38.040]  together but here the reason I want to have you on is the film look the films
[22:38.040 --> 22:43.480]  of powerhouse film and I don't think you're a unique let's talk about Steve
[22:43.480 --> 22:49.920]  Bannon okay okay we'll talk about yeah but I'd listen I but here's why I
[22:49.920 --> 22:53.640]  think so important because your trials coming up and look you're a fighter and
[22:53.640 --> 22:57.440]  they're obviously trying to take you down the point I don't think people get
[22:57.440 --> 23:02.000]  about you I we do at the war room and I personally do because I followed you for
[23:02.000 --> 23:06.080]  years is that you're not just a man of action the guy that they see on that
[23:06.080 --> 23:08.520]  show every night the guy they see out the bullhorn the guy that's taking
[23:08.520 --> 23:12.120]  leadership and saying hey you know I'm like in the first tank and we'll drive
[23:12.120 --> 23:19.440]  this as much and as important as that leadership is the true thing that you've
[23:19.440 --> 23:24.600]  done which is stunning if you look at the evidence of that of the facts you are
[23:24.600 --> 23:29.280]  one of the great thinkers of this that is very rare you got to go back almost to
[23:29.280 --> 23:34.040]  the revolutionary generation and see that in this new book I got to tell you
[23:34.040 --> 23:37.840]  when Tony Lyons first approached me I read this thing I go this is it this
[23:37.840 --> 23:42.480]  guy has summarized these pulled together in this new the film is powerful but the
[23:42.480 --> 23:46.960]  film is going to show Alex Jones in all his glory the good and the bad and you
[23:46.960 --> 23:51.240]  make your decision but you see Alex Jones the brawler Alex Jones the
[23:51.240 --> 23:55.240]  intellectual brawler but this book the great reset in the war for the world I'm
[23:55.240 --> 23:58.560]  telling you everybody in America the people that hate Alex Jones the most
[23:58.560 --> 24:02.640]  have to read this book this is no beach read you're not gonna be flipping pages
[24:02.640 --> 24:05.480]  or you're gonna be having a pen out you're gonna be underlying stuff it's
[24:05.480 --> 24:10.040]  amazing so look I appreciate the kind words and a look you know we're both in
[24:10.040 --> 24:12.920]  this and there's no back down you know Tucker I was on Tucker last night
[24:12.920 --> 24:18.160]  Trump you made others that we're not gonna back down an inch we can't that the
[24:18.160 --> 24:21.960]  Republic this is a fourth turning the Republic is is in play right now we're
[24:21.960 --> 24:24.960]  either gonna win or we're gonna lose it's very simple right and because Steve
[24:24.960 --> 24:28.960]  let's explain this to viewers if we back down it's like dying it's like
[24:28.960 --> 24:32.200]  committing suicide to back down we're not looking for trouble but we just can't
[24:32.200 --> 24:35.920]  back down we need America to understand that you be with us together
[24:35.920 --> 24:41.440]  exactly we just were not backing down we can't do it no absolutely I tell you
[24:41.440 --> 24:44.840]  what I'm gonna take a short break here I'm gonna get Alex I want to talk about

[26:07.600 --> 26:13.760]  War Room pandemic with Stephen K. Vannum the epidemic is a demon and we cannot let this
[26:13.760 --> 26:23.120]  demon hide here's your host Stephen K. Vannum you know people that have watched
[26:23.120 --> 26:26.160]  this show know me over the years you know you know the financial times the
[26:26.160 --> 26:29.240]  economists we go through that's the way play every day we start with MSNBC and
[26:29.240 --> 26:33.000]  CNN clips are not playing conservative right wing news so I'm a I'm a huge
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.400]  believer in information in collecting information and I go to I watch the
[26:38.400 --> 26:43.160]  the the info wars every day and follow Alex Jones closely you know why he can
[26:43.160 --> 26:48.480]  put you ahead of the curve and he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist
[26:48.480 --> 26:55.720]  right I gotta tell you this book the great reset in the war for the world is
[26:55.720 --> 27:00.600]  the the left in the mainstream media are going to have to sit there and we've
[27:00.600 --> 27:06.320]  got to force them to respond to this book this book is that important and Alex
[27:06.320 --> 27:10.920]  I appreciate it and I don't understand as busy as you are doing as many hours of
[27:10.920 --> 27:13.600]  the day and all the other things you do are getting out there and leading from
[27:13.600 --> 27:16.760]  the front tank and going to rallies and doing all that I don't honestly
[27:16.760 --> 27:20.920]  understand humanly how you pulled this together I want you to make the case that
[27:20.920 --> 27:26.400]  you make in this book the great reset because you take three authors
[27:26.400 --> 27:31.640]  essentially and you tie together these three books to make the case of showing
[27:31.640 --> 27:36.480]  data and evidence through their words you take Klaus Schwab in the fourth
[27:36.480 --> 27:41.760]  industrial revolution you take the CEO of Nadella the CEO the followed Gates and
[27:41.760 --> 27:47.200]  those guys at and Gates is a guy has CEO and Microsoft hit reset and then you
[27:47.200 --> 27:52.480]  take your vault Noah Herrera Homo Deus and his other books and you make the case
[27:52.480 --> 27:58.240]  of what the not just the New World Order is but using this great reset to
[27:58.240 --> 28:03.320]  really take up there's whole idea of control and authoritarianism and combine
[28:03.320 --> 28:06.560]  it really with state capitalism so I want you make the case here in the great
[28:06.560 --> 28:11.280]  reset what is this great reset and why are we at a war for the world right now
[28:11.280 --> 28:18.880]  sir the establishment is a lot of different power groups as you know but
[28:18.880 --> 28:22.760]  science is always the cutting edge and they know there's a revolution of
[28:22.760 --> 28:26.280]  science and so they want to control that science I want to be the people that
[28:26.280 --> 28:31.240]  direct that science and they don't bring in a worldwide authoritarian system they
[28:31.240 --> 28:35.480]  know there'll be competition to them and they're basically afraid all right
[28:35.480 --> 28:38.560]  folks this is a good part of the interview right now amazing to be on
[28:38.560 --> 28:41.880]  the street man he has a giant shell a lot of courage and it's now about to be a
[28:41.880 --> 28:45.360]  political prisoner like so many of us as we go into this dark night of tyranny
[28:45.360 --> 28:50.520]  but the enemy is splashing out because they know humanity is waking up it's
[28:50.520 --> 28:57.280]  the great awakening versus the great reset stay with us
[28:57.280 --> 29:04.760]  we are now living in the void sliding towards collapse in the strange space
[29:04.760 --> 29:10.280]  between what we've known and what's to come and right now the most important
[29:10.280 --> 29:15.640]  thing to remember is don't panic stay calm because now is the time that we
[29:15.640 --> 29:21.120]  must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe sound course there is
[29:21.120 --> 29:26.320]  nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building our

[33:05.960 --> 33:08.960]  Alex Jones
[33:38.720 --> 33:43.680]  welcome back to this live sunday July 24th worldwide broadcast I'm your host
[33:43.680 --> 33:47.680]  Alex Jones a special four-hour live transmission tonight
[33:47.680 --> 33:53.440]  Glenn Greenwald interviewed me at length yesterday at the film premiere for
[33:53.440 --> 33:58.880]  the documentary Alex's war that's a very fair film it's a critical film it's I
[33:58.880 --> 34:03.000]  would say a very accurate snapshot representation of what we do what we
[34:03.000 --> 34:07.120]  stand for maybe proud of my work in many areas and not so proud in other areas and
[34:07.120 --> 34:11.640]  I you know talked about that because life is working progress with Glenn and so
[34:11.640 --> 34:15.640]  we're gonna be airing large excerpts of that interview in the second hour then
[34:15.640 --> 34:22.880]  Eddie Bravo taped with us yesterday in studio before the premiere we're gonna
[34:22.880 --> 34:29.040]  be airing that coming up and also Harrison Smith and so much more the full
[34:29.040 --> 34:32.920]  Steve Bannon interview that we won't have time to air all of we're about 60% of it
[34:32.920 --> 34:38.240]  is obviously on his site on rumble and we posted it to info wars.com if you
[34:38.240 --> 34:40.720]  like to go watch it without the interruptions and things but let me just
[34:40.720 --> 34:45.560]  throw this out there real quick because you know Steve's better than I am at
[34:45.560 --> 34:50.280]  plug-in books since he's written a lot more books than I have this really is
[34:50.280 --> 34:54.400]  an important book and if you think the video clips on the show and the
[34:54.400 --> 34:59.680]  documents are powerful this is a thick book but a a fast read but also a deep
[34:59.680 --> 35:04.640]  read because it's it's got all the proof of the nightmare world government
[35:04.640 --> 35:10.160]  dehumanization transhumanist plan the population plan and it's all in one book
[35:10.160 --> 35:13.960]  there's a lot of great reset books out there that are excellent including those
[35:13.960 --> 35:17.080]  written by the globalist themselves that they're evil but they're excellent at
[35:17.080 --> 35:22.120]  telling you what they're gonna do to you this book now available at amazon.com
[35:22.120 --> 35:27.600]  is the best overall work out there today I'm sure stuff will come out that's
[35:27.600 --> 35:30.160]  even more important in the future because people have more information but
[35:30.160 --> 35:35.240]  this is really a total conviction of these criminals it's not for sale yet on
[35:35.240 --> 35:40.360]  infowarstore.com because we were greenlit to sell it last week and we
[35:40.360 --> 35:43.800]  just never put it up for sale that's how we roll not mad at anybody it's just
[35:43.800 --> 35:48.040]  how rag tag we are and you know what's going on around here but by tomorrow it
[35:48.040 --> 35:54.720]  will be up for pre-sale and it starts shipping on August 15th at infowarstore.com
[35:54.720 --> 36:00.880]  or triple eight two five three three one three nine but right now it is
[36:00.880 --> 36:04.360]  available at Barnes & Noble and Amazon and places like that and it's important
[36:04.360 --> 36:07.760]  to get it from Amazon because if it pushes up to the number one political
[36:07.760 --> 36:11.040]  book or even number one book period that makes everybody else start buying it
[36:11.040 --> 36:14.720]  causes a big political firestorm and then the message really gets out there so I
[36:14.720 --> 36:17.800]  don't normally say go to Amazon to get stuff but in the case of the great
[36:17.800 --> 36:21.760]  reset you get a really good deal on it and we want to send it to number one so
[36:21.760 --> 36:28.720]  go to Amazon.com get the great reset and the war for the world by yours truly
[36:28.720 --> 36:31.920]  Alex Jones there and if you want to support us you can start buying some
[36:31.920 --> 36:37.280]  copies on Monday hopefully it'll be up at infowarstore.com and you can also get
[36:37.280 --> 36:41.880]  signed copies there as well so again the great reset and the war for the world
[36:41.880 --> 36:46.000]  we're gonna go out to break in seven minutes with more of the band and clip
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.680]  and then we're gonna come back without my introduction in the last segment of
[36:50.680 --> 36:54.760]  the show as well and then the Glenn Greenwald on-stage interview last night
[36:54.760 --> 36:57.560]  that was really powerful folks are saying that they thought it was very
[36:57.560 --> 37:02.040]  informative that is coming up in the second hour tonight so here is more of
[37:02.040 --> 37:09.760]  the Steve Bannon War Room Alex Jones interview. The establishment is a lot
[37:09.760 --> 37:13.840]  of different power groups as you know but science is always the cutting edge and
[37:13.840 --> 37:17.280]  they know there's a revolution of science and so they want to control that
[37:17.280 --> 37:21.000]  science I want to be the people that direct that science and they don't bring
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.360]  in a worldwide authoritarian system they know there'll be competition to them
[37:25.360 --> 37:29.920]  and they're basically afraid of these massive technological developments that
[37:29.920 --> 37:35.680]  are about to happen contrary to limits to growth and things that MIT put out in
[37:35.680 --> 37:41.280]  the 60s claiming society we collapse will actually expand infinitely with our
[37:41.280 --> 37:46.360]  technology if we have a culture if we're moral and we don't destroy each other
[37:46.360 --> 37:53.400]  and so they have decided to trigger a controlled collapse and then bring in a
[37:53.400 --> 37:57.720]  new dark age to control the general public where they will be in their
[37:57.720 --> 38:02.760]  Elysium fields you know to use the Greek analogy where where they're these
[38:02.760 --> 38:06.920]  demigods and then if they even keep us around it's like you let some ants live
[38:06.920 --> 38:11.240]  in your backyard you have a potted plant as Ray Kurzweil has said and so really
[38:11.240 --> 38:16.880]  it was easy to write this book if the problem was condensing it down because
[38:16.880 --> 38:21.040]  they tell us what they're doing we're gonna be gods Ray Kurzweil says I don't
[38:21.040 --> 38:25.880]  believe in God yet I'm gonna become a God he's gonna resurrect his father but
[38:25.880 --> 38:30.960]  he needs all of us to get in line behind his AI so he can be God over us and so
[38:30.960 --> 38:34.040]  it's basically a destruction of free will and so you look at Harari and you
[38:34.040 --> 38:38.520]  look at all these people that are in the book they say we're gonna be gods we're
[38:38.520 --> 38:43.200]  about to be gods but we've got to get everybody in line to do what we say
[38:43.200 --> 38:48.160]  before we can become those gods and it's just quote after quote after quote of
[38:48.160 --> 38:51.960]  just the most insane stuff that if your neighbor said it you know you'd lock
[38:51.960 --> 38:55.160]  your door and be scared of them but they're up there at the Nabos group and
[38:55.160 --> 38:58.360]  they're writing books and they're making these statements saying resistance is
[38:58.360 --> 39:04.160]  futile we're gonna take your body over the future is not human looking
[39:04.160 --> 39:07.200]  forward the end of humanity but these are Wall Street Journal headlines these
[39:07.200 --> 39:11.520]  are New York Times headlines and it's these people these self-appointed high
[39:11.520 --> 39:16.120]  priests that are just saying we are in control of your destiny oh but it's gonna
[39:16.120 --> 39:19.000]  be wonderful and you're gonna be empowered but we're gonna control everything
[39:19.000 --> 39:26.520]  you do so so it's it's a authoritarian delusion of grandeur but because humans
[39:26.520 --> 39:30.400]  are so amazing and we are made by God we've created such great technology
[39:30.400 --> 39:35.280]  they're just declaring themselves the aficionados of humans and that they're
[39:35.280 --> 39:39.600]  in charge of our of our development and where we're going and so it's literally
[39:39.600 --> 39:44.840]  a hijacking the old global elites couldn't beat the Renaissance innovation
[39:44.840 --> 39:50.800]  550 years ago the Gutenberg press and so it's been them trying to maintain and
[39:50.800 --> 39:54.160]  control technology because it threatens them and so now they're trying to use
[39:54.160 --> 39:58.680]  technology to superimpose their will over us but just like internet backfired
[39:58.680 --> 40:03.000]  on them it's gonna backfire on them again so again it's a bunch of mad scientists
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.840]  self-appointed control freaks who have set themselves up as the new priests
[40:06.840 --> 40:11.040]  class who are self-anointed and are telling us that we have to get in line
[40:11.040 --> 40:14.720]  with the utopia they're building but when we see the great reset the cutting
[40:14.720 --> 40:18.800]  off of energy and the so-called great transition there we're in there is no
[40:18.800 --> 40:24.080]  new technology coming in they're blocking that and so really they're just
[40:24.080 --> 40:28.520]  imploding things under the cloud and Pippin model so that they can get that
[40:28.520 --> 40:33.680]  control over us walk me through Klaus Schwab how did you've been at this now
[40:33.680 --> 40:37.040]  for 20 or 30 years you've been focused on this what you call the new world order
[40:37.040 --> 40:42.040]  tell us about how does a guy like Klaus Schwab come up and take this conference
[40:42.040 --> 40:45.840]  started in Davos and let this be kind of the governing in the other or the
[40:45.840 --> 40:50.600]  governor mechanism of all this how did he pull this off because you start off
[40:50.600 --> 40:54.160]  by his fourth industrial revolution tell us about Schwab how they pulled off in
[40:54.160 --> 40:58.720]  Davos and what's important about his book the fourth industrial revolution
[40:58.720 --> 41:06.280]  wow that's huge up Klaus Schwab and his family go back being technocrats going
[41:06.280 --> 41:15.080]  back into World War two and on the bad guy side and he was a protege of Henry
[41:15.080 --> 41:21.240]  Kissinger and that whole OSS CIA Atlantic Alliance and so the Bilderberg
[41:21.240 --> 41:26.080]  group set up in Usherbeck Holland in 1954 was a alliance the old European
[41:26.080 --> 41:28.920]  elite and the Anglo-American establishment the British Empire in the
[41:28.920 --> 41:35.400]  US and was a consortium meeting on time to create consensus within the elites
[41:35.400 --> 41:39.720]  and then once they had that by the 70s and the trilateral Commission was set
[41:39.720 --> 41:43.960]  up by David Rockefeller and Jimmy Carter once they kind of had that order set up
[41:43.960 --> 41:48.480]  then they said okay we've got to take this royal roundtable international
[41:48.480 --> 41:53.640]  organization royal international affairs the British model of its CFR is the
[41:53.640 --> 41:58.200]  US model we've got to now take that to the to the state and to the county into
[41:58.200 --> 42:05.720]  the city and to the ecumenical and the educational systems and and and really
[42:05.720 --> 42:10.120]  put that program in and as Klaus Schwab says we penetrate the cabinets we
[42:10.120 --> 42:15.120]  control half the governments you will eat the bugs and and so he is really the
[42:15.120 --> 42:21.320]  press secretary of this and they then used the quote world economic forum
[42:21.320 --> 42:25.520]  with massive money and private jets and all the things that come with that the
[42:25.520 --> 42:30.480]  big dinners and the other things that you get when you go the sex operatives all
[42:30.480 --> 42:35.640]  of it and they just roped in all the best talent and all the best people from
[42:35.640 --> 42:41.400]  every level media academia a business government and just brought them all in

[46:58.680 --> 47:26.000]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.440]  tomorrow's news today
[47:40.560 --> 47:45.200]  socialism is the operating system for the general masses just like China's
[47:45.200 --> 47:49.440]  communist but it's really rich oligarchs and you know Obama before he left
[47:49.440 --> 47:53.200]  office came speeches of South America saying listen we need to mix the
[47:53.200 --> 47:56.760]  communism and capitalism like one country's communist the others capitalist
[47:56.760 --> 48:01.520]  but those are the feudal slaves under communism and then you have the quote
[48:01.520 --> 48:06.120]  capitalist system extracting it but it's not really capitalist it's a fascist
[48:06.120 --> 48:11.840]  crony capitalist authoritarian system over it and so Klaus Schwab is the
[48:11.840 --> 48:16.040]  mouthpiece of these organizations and groups and they create the press releases
[48:16.040 --> 48:20.240]  the operational memorandums that then gets sent out to Australia and New Zealand
[48:20.240 --> 48:23.960]  and Germany and France and the US and Canada and you know over a hundred
[48:23.960 --> 48:28.760]  countries who all now the politicians speak in one unified voice why we see
[48:28.760 --> 48:34.160]  those composite videos where one person says build back better great reset
[48:34.160 --> 48:37.760]  transition and then it's one another one another one and all sudden there's a
[48:37.760 --> 48:43.400]  hundred screens and a hundred languages all saying we're doing this and then
[48:43.400 --> 48:46.480]  we go hey we don't want our energy cut off you don't even have a replacement
[48:46.480 --> 48:52.600]  they go oh no that's a conspiracy theory or or oh Putin did that that's why your
[48:52.600 --> 48:55.600]  gas prices are up for the local gas station but then on the other side of
[48:55.600 --> 49:00.640]  their mouth they say no no this is good you need pain booty judges said and and
[49:00.640 --> 49:04.960]  and granholm and all of them we're doing this in a transition but it's not a
[49:04.960 --> 49:10.720]  transition into a better Star Trek civilization it's a transition into a
[49:10.720 --> 49:14.760]  new feudal estate literally cutting off the energy to make everybody pour and
[49:14.760 --> 49:20.920]  dump down feudalism 2.0 and so that's that's what the great reset is that's
[49:20.920 --> 49:26.600]  what claus Schwab is that's what this professor of medieval studies Harari is
[49:26.600 --> 49:30.160]  none of those are his ideas that's all been said by the club of Rome it's all
[49:30.160 --> 49:33.320]  been said by the Bilderberg group it's all been said by limits to growth it you
[49:33.320 --> 49:36.400]  know it's all been said by the population bomb it's all been said in

[49:49.680 --> 49:53.000]  look at it you know this is the closest thing to Hitler I've ever seen this is
[49:53.000 --> 49:58.560]  like Hitler 5.0 this is like Hitler Buck Rogers level with with what they're
[49:58.560 --> 50:04.640]  saying and they're just in this huge revolution against choice and free will
[50:04.640 --> 50:09.720]  and normal technological development and adoption of technology that empowers
[50:09.720 --> 50:15.200]  humanity instead they want adoption of technology forced adoption world IDs
[50:15.200 --> 50:19.840]  global social credit scores carbon taxes that that dominate and monitor every

[50:49.160 --> 50:54.880]  major works by by major there this is not intellectual slumming this is a
[50:54.880 --> 51:01.080]  heavy book and he takes away he takes apart and and repurposes in their works

[51:16.280 --> 51:19.920]  ever participated as an interview is made by an independent filmmaker quite
[51:19.920 --> 51:24.840]  frankly a stunning filmmaker it's out on the 29th of July Alex is finishing up
[51:24.840 --> 51:28.160]  this book but he can pre-order it one of the Tony lines of the Sky Horse press

[51:31.880 --> 51:36.440]  Jones just a moment
[51:40.440 --> 51:46.360]  the story you're about to see is truth this is reality truth is stranger than
[51:46.360 --> 51:52.720]  fiction I'm the most fan most evenized media person in the world Alex Jones is
[51:52.720 --> 51:58.640]  a fake and he's a performance artist I'm perceived as a clown to nut maniac on
[51:58.640 --> 52:04.440]  his website info wars he touts Aaron Aaron Neuerborn the sickest most
[52:04.440 --> 52:10.440]  offensive theories Alex Jones claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings
[52:10.440 --> 52:15.040]  were inside jobs don't you stand for America sir he said me and Hillary are
[52:15.040 --> 52:26.280]  demons I met him back in 1990 I knew right away he was gonna be a star I saw
[52:26.280 --> 52:28.960]  all these conspiracy terrorists that we're talking about the new world order
[52:28.960 --> 52:36.760]  that's what I'll do was that attack on humanity I saw early on that I really
[52:36.760 --> 52:39.840]  wanted to waste war on you're lying to the public it's disgusting when she
[52:39.840 --> 52:45.720]  tastes that there's no one backed everything's a war that's the way the
[52:45.720 --> 52:49.800]  universe works and everything is propaganda I don't trust Donald Trump
[52:49.800 --> 52:54.320]  but I agree with probably 95% of what Donald Trump says your reputation is
[52:54.320 --> 53:01.640]  amazing I will not let you down that's what the media loves off Alex Jones said
[53:01.640 --> 53:06.000]  the Sandy Hook shooting which claimed the lives of 20 children was fake I try
[53:06.000 --> 53:09.120]  to tell the truth and sometimes I'm wrong to the New York Times getting
[53:09.120 --> 53:13.560]  trouble for consciously lying about WMD's that then led to a war still tens of
[53:13.560 --> 53:18.600]  thousands of consulate no the attempts to platform us to fail they've had the
[53:18.600 --> 53:22.880]  CIA the FBI following me around now we gotta destroy Alex Jones we're not
[53:22.880 --> 53:33.160]  playing games here it's all just insane okay let's put me in prison for
[53:33.160 --> 53:36.280]  questioning okay even though that's my right let's execute Alex Jones let's
[53:36.280 --> 53:41.120]  let's put them in front of a firing squad pull the trigger I have a sick
[53:41.120 --> 53:45.360]  feeling actually because I know it comes next
[53:45.360 --> 53:53.160]  okay a blockbuster film premieres tonight in Austin Texas Alex's war Alex
[53:53.160 --> 53:57.000]  Jones is a interviewed by it but it's not by him it's by a fantastic filmmaker
[53:57.000 --> 54:02.920]  and it's not a you know it's not a hyography it's a it's a tough film but
[54:02.920 --> 54:07.200]  I gotta tell you I think you watch it you come away with an appreciation that is
[54:07.200 --> 54:11.360]  I think a lot of people are gonna be blown away by this also a major new book
[54:11.360 --> 54:15.140]  comes out basically in mid-August being finishing up by now now by Alex the
[54:15.140 --> 54:19.160]  great reset in the war for the world it's incredible some of the things were
[54:19.160 --> 54:23.840]  breaking down with Alex Alex one of the things I I loved about the book is that
[54:23.840 --> 54:29.120]  because I said I said I think he's the first guy since besides me that thinks
[54:29.120 --> 54:33.240]  hey you've had Kissinger but then he got Mika Brzezinski's dad Dr. Brzezinski
[54:33.240 --> 54:37.960]  was national security visor after Kissinger when the Ford administration
[54:37.960 --> 54:42.880]  was defeated by Carter he came in but I've said for years he's actually 10x
[54:42.880 --> 54:47.760]  the intellectual thinker geopolitically and what and if he had this boy
[54:47.760 --> 54:52.840]  which you cite that if you read it it really was the railhead of everything
[54:52.840 --> 54:57.520]  that's kind of happening for the talents about Dr. Brzezinski versus Dr. Henry
[54:57.520 --> 55:02.600]  Kissinger sir well you're absolutely right I mentioned Kissinger because
[55:02.600 --> 55:08.040]  Posh Schwab directly worked under him but the real intellectual that got his
[55:08.040 --> 55:15.440]  ideas adopted was Zbigniew Brzezinski who of course helped start the Afghan war
[55:15.440 --> 55:18.840]  and lured the Soviets in he was quite the mastermind he wrote the Grand
[55:18.840 --> 55:22.720]  Chess Board you know a decade or so ago admitting his world government plans but
[55:22.720 --> 55:27.200]  I read when I was a teenager because my dad was really into it when I was a
[55:27.200 --> 55:29.560]  little kid he said you ought to read these books when you get old enough so I
[55:29.560 --> 55:32.880]  read the technotronic era and several others and he was talking about micro
[55:32.880 --> 55:36.560]  chips to buy and sell into your skin he was talking about a technocracy with
[55:36.560 --> 55:40.600]  computers controlling everything you did he was explaining how governments
[55:40.600 --> 55:45.200]  actually control but Alex Alex that's why I'm sure you understand that book
[55:45.200 --> 55:52.720]  came out basically in the 70s correct yes sir 1970 read this you he was laying
[55:52.720 --> 55:57.400]  out exactly where this was headed correct absolutely and then he is the
[55:57.400 --> 56:02.720]  main thinker and he gave a speech at the Canadian CFR again about a decade ago
[56:02.720 --> 56:07.320]  where he said that people could pull the quote up he said before we could use
[56:07.320 --> 56:11.160]  propaganda to control people it was infinitely easier to control a million
[56:11.160 --> 56:14.640]  people propaganda now it's infinitely easier to kill them and we may just have
[56:14.640 --> 56:20.840]  to get rid of everybody so Brzezinski in some of his books bragged well I didn't
[56:20.840 --> 56:25.040]  kill the Cambodians but I put Paul Pond in to do it so it's just when you're
[56:25.040 --> 56:30.760]  you're reading what a real psychopath is is is saying here so I guess that's why
[56:30.760 --> 56:35.640]  Mika is so attracted to Scarborough no psycho psycho jokes I guess he's like
[56:35.640 --> 56:42.800]  daddy but she's looking for daddy again there believe that all over okay I want
[56:42.800 --> 56:45.600]  to pivot I want to get into more we're gonna have Alex back to go through this
[56:45.600 --> 56:49.880]  because the book is the the great reason here's the thing this is not a
[56:49.880 --> 56:54.240]  beach book I want you to take it to the beach but this is not like some smile
[56:54.240 --> 56:58.600]  spy novel you buy in the airport this is a serious book and it's got to be
[56:58.600 --> 57:01.280]  treated seriously I think you're actually toning the guys I'll put a study
[57:01.280 --> 57:04.560]  guide out with it because it's that important Alex tell us about your
[57:04.560 --> 57:08.560]  upcoming travails they're clearly not there it's beyond trying to shut you up
[57:08.560 --> 57:13.160]  they can't do that they've tried that every different way they're trying to

[57:17.360 --> 57:23.160]  happening well you've been alright we're going to come back and start our

[57:30.640 --> 57:34.680]  gonna get to the Glenn Greenwald interview he did with me last night this

[59:06.360 --> 59:10.640]  all of them just screw you over especially the big firms and the big
[59:10.640 --> 59:13.880]  tax groups because they're part of the system and they don't want the general
[59:13.880 --> 59:17.800]  public understanding this and knowing this so it's a very important situation
[59:17.800 --> 59:23.760]  with inflation all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do

[59:48.320 --> 59:57.080]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:00:04.080 --> 1:00:10.640]  they're trying to they're trying to expunge you in any way possible walk us
[1:00:10.640 --> 1:00:15.280]  through what's happening well you've been through this president Trump's been
[1:00:15.280 --> 1:00:20.560]  through this and what they do is they're they fear populace they fear loyal
[1:00:20.560 --> 1:00:24.200]  Americans that believe in the you know America and promoting it because they
[1:00:24.200 --> 1:00:27.200]  know that's going to be popular they have to shut that down or they can demonize
[1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:30.520]  Steve Bannon and destroy Steve Bannon they can demonize the stones or Donald
[1:00:30.520 --> 1:00:33.960]  Trump and I'm not trying to put myself in that league but we're that that's the
[1:00:33.960 --> 1:00:37.480]  league it's like your college Jones are the main targets kind of going down from
[1:00:37.480 --> 1:00:40.640]  there I think you're probably a bigger target because you're respecting it or
[1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:44.120]  also you have your intelligence background and they know was the
[1:00:44.120 --> 1:00:48.800]  brink by a lot of Trump's successes and and so I'm not the labishing you it's
[1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:52.720]  just true I guess here's how I hang on there's why I disagree with this
[1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:58.400]  because I think I like Trump you have a you know as Bernard Charles said all
[1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:04.080]  only connect you have a way of connecting with the working class in this
[1:01:04.080 --> 1:01:07.000]  country in the middle class in this country that is very powerful I mean
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:10.440]  one of my guilty pleasures is watching your rants and they're they're
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:14.240]  absolutely amazing there I mean they're incredible you have a way of connecting
[1:01:14.240 --> 1:01:19.440]  like Trump has a way of connecting that is their biggest fear their biggest fear
[1:01:19.440 --> 1:01:24.360]  is the education and enlightenment the awakening of that army of what I call
[1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:28.440]  the army of the awakened and they will take I think Tucker and I are far and
[1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:33.840]  back of that because you and Trump have a way of connecting a hard connection with
[1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:38.200]  that that is you can't coach that right that's a God-given talent that's just
[1:01:38.200 --> 1:01:41.960]  a native charisma and you have it that's why the hell I don't want to say that I've
[1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:48.120]  got what what what what they're what are they trying to do right now they've
[1:01:48.120 --> 1:01:51.880]  done everything possible in the technocratic way to shut you down
[1:01:51.880 --> 1:01:55.280]  eliminate your voice you've powered through that what is the latest they're
[1:01:55.280 --> 1:02:01.040]  trying to do to destroy you well if you try to describe it under you just what
[1:02:01.040 --> 1:02:03.760]  I know would take hours of I try to describe it would take hours but here's
[1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:10.720]  the bottom line I have the motions in limity at info wars calm of the judges
[1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:14.560]  order of the first of three rig sandy hook trials where I've already been found
[1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:18.480]  guilty I've been defaulted when I gave them everything and more which they use
[1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:23.600]  them as a bleep a blueprint to further debank us and he platform us and the
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:28.120]  judge put in the order for the trial where I'm guilty that I cannot say I'm
[1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:32.160]  innocent says word for word may not see your innocent anyway well if that was a
[1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:35.760]  murderer you know caught with dead bodies in my basement I would could get up
[1:02:35.760 --> 1:02:39.560]  and say I'm innocent of the jury I could I could say I'm not guilty no I am
[1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:44.800]  guilty and I can't cross examine anybody and I can't raise the First
[1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:49.520]  Amendment and I can't say the trial is rigged and so but then we're ordered to
[1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:54.080]  have this trial or I'll be held in contempt she did a million dollar fine a
[1:02:54.080 --> 1:02:58.560]  month ago court of appeals turned it around in one day and said pay it I
[1:02:58.560 --> 1:03:02.760]  paid a million dollars of and I'm out of money they finally run me to ground I
[1:03:02.760 --> 1:03:07.440]  paid a million dollars on Monday that literally brought the company down like
[1:03:07.440 --> 1:03:10.840]  $300,000 in the bank but that's okay lizards are coming to supporting us but
[1:03:10.840 --> 1:03:14.960]  this is a real war as you nailed it you stole my thunder because you I understand
[1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:18.120]  why you want to show people this is veritas we're some pateco because the
[1:03:18.120 --> 1:03:22.280]  truth is the truth they hate Steve Bannon they hate Tucker Carlson they
[1:03:22.280 --> 1:03:27.200]  hate Donald Trump they hate me because we are populist we are we love the people
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:30.920]  the people get that they can see it they can feel it and they've seen we've gone
[1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:34.120]  through and they don't want them to have a spirit so they think if they can
[1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:38.560]  break us and destroy us that's their symbol of the American people Trump
[1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:42.200]  always says look they got to get through me to get to you and it's totally true
[1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:45.720]  we have decided to stand up because we love America and we can't stand seeing
[1:03:45.720 --> 1:03:49.400]  this happen we're not heroes we just can't roll over it's like being raped
[1:03:49.400 --> 1:03:54.440]  and so they see us standing up I think if they can break us and smash us they
[1:03:54.440 --> 1:03:58.920]  can do it and this is not my rights that are being robbed it's all of our rights
[1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:04.040]  I mean when Steve Bannon cannot cross examine people at his own trial in a
[1:04:04.040 --> 1:04:08.360]  rigged DC situation we are all having our rights stolen and when I can't say
[1:04:08.360 --> 1:04:12.920]  I'm innocent and can't say I'm bankrupt and can't say there's three trials coming
[1:04:12.920 --> 1:04:18.440]  up literally she says we can say almost nothing but we have to be there and so
[1:04:18.440 --> 1:04:22.920]  that's where this is and again I'm just blessed that it's not criminal like it
[1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:26.160]  is for you or what Julian Assange so anytime I feel sorry for myself I go
[1:04:26.160 --> 1:04:31.040]  well there's Julian Assange and there's Roger Stone and there's people like
[1:04:31.040 --> 1:04:34.240]  Steve Bannon that have been really persecuted but I understand that's their
[1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:38.320]  next phase is they're also always implying everything's criminal I'm doing
[1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:41.960]  and everything and I need to and I know they got grand juries open and we that
[1:04:41.960 --> 1:04:45.880]  grand jury subpoenas and some of them not talked about on air but it's just a
[1:04:45.880 --> 1:04:50.080]  nightmare and I'm not a victim I asked for this I got the arena but I want
[1:04:50.080 --> 1:04:53.920]  America to know we're fighting for you we're fighting for our own families

[1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:42.320]  really demonized for coming to interview me the left said hey you can
[1:06:42.320 --> 1:06:44.800]  interview Charlie Manson you can interview Saddam the same you can
[1:06:44.800 --> 1:06:47.680]  interview Alex Jones because then they can't misrepresent what I've actually
[1:06:47.680 --> 1:06:51.560]  said and done we talk about free speech the attack on liberty the death of the
[1:06:51.560 --> 1:06:56.440]  corporate media and so much more and then after that Eddie Bravo in studio
[1:06:56.440 --> 1:07:00.280]  Harrison Smith and so much more for the balance of the hour ladies and gentlemen
[1:07:00.280 --> 1:07:06.560]  here is large sections of the event streamed by Rockfinn find the whole
[1:07:06.560 --> 1:07:12.560]  interview there we'll also be linking to it at info wars.com but here it is so do
[1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:16.000]  you want to end the weirdness of talking about Alex Jones right in front of him
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:23.120]  if he's not here and bring him up on stage all right get up here AJ come on Alex
[1:07:28.320 --> 1:07:34.760]  does he have a mic yeah he should have a mic we can share you can share no I
[1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:39.480]  mean I haven't asked you want to talk
[1:07:39.480 --> 1:07:48.200]  no I mean listen I got into this on access TV when I was 21 years old and I
[1:07:48.200 --> 1:07:52.120]  but I meant everything purity I made a lot of mistakes I've done a lot of bad
[1:07:52.120 --> 1:07:55.720]  stuff it wasn't on purpose so it's great to be here with Glenn Greenwald it's
[1:07:55.720 --> 1:08:00.160]  great to be here with Alex Moyer and the thing is I didn't lie on purpose I made
[1:08:00.160 --> 1:08:04.360]  a lot of mistakes but I'm not some person getting orders in lying to people and
[1:08:04.360 --> 1:08:07.680]  we're probably like 90% accurate we're gonna we're gonna pull this right here
[1:08:07.680 --> 1:08:12.680]  I'm gonna make that decision you know you learn things about the universe and
[1:08:12.680 --> 1:08:16.560]  then you know what's gonna happen and I'm not mad at the crew I'm not mad at
[1:08:16.560 --> 1:08:20.520]  anybody that's why I couldn't leave today and just air these things once
[1:08:20.520 --> 1:08:26.640]  problems start they just continue on and on and on so they had a problem with the
[1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:30.160]  file they sent us and they jacked with it for like four hours for the show I was
[1:08:30.160 --> 1:08:33.600]  told hey the audio is great but as soon as we're the computer and played here it's
[1:08:33.600 --> 1:08:37.080]  the weird thing about computers like all the time we'll grab an MSNBC clip or a
[1:08:37.080 --> 1:08:41.560]  CNN clip or a C-SPAN clip looks crystal clear looks fine a computer we transfer
[1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:45.680]  it over and it's garbled you may never see the Glenn Greenwald interview I don't
[1:08:45.680 --> 1:08:48.160]  think a good recording of it was made but it doesn't matter Glenn Greenwald
[1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:53.520]  bucked all the folks he came to the deal and now broadcast changes I'm here
[1:08:53.520 --> 1:08:57.880]  ladies and gentlemen and guess what I got ready for the show and I've got all
[1:08:57.880 --> 1:09:03.320]  this powerful news and all this powerful information to cover and I told you when
[1:09:03.320 --> 1:09:07.880]  I was a young I didn't follow my instincts but the deepest thing Donald
[1:09:07.880 --> 1:09:11.300]  Trump ever said was that's reason I'm telling the story right now it's a
[1:09:11.300 --> 1:09:16.920]  teaching moment that the deepest thing he ever discovered was being shallow that
[1:09:16.920 --> 1:09:23.040]  is such a Zen Yoda statement and the media made fun of it and said the deepest
[1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:28.720]  thing he ever learned was to be shallow but your instincts your spirit your
[1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:32.320]  discernment if you have it your immediate women's intuition whatever you
[1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:37.280]  want to call it that you have is a gestalt stand of all the information you
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:42.920]  have and patterns that your brain has learned to see and understand and it's
[1:09:42.920 --> 1:09:48.240]  always right and I said my instinct is this will never air on the show or
[1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:52.400]  tonight and it's just gone with it I should just go with it so I did I'm
[1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:56.560]  happy and it's cool and I hope we find a good copy of the Glenn Greenwald thing
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:09:59.600]  because it was a great interview people said it was the best ever they loved it
[1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:02.440]  he's got a lot of courage and we appreciate him doesn't agree with a lot
[1:10:02.440 --> 1:10:06.360]  of stuff I say but he understands it's important be able to talk to folks to
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:09.320]  be able to have discussions with him so but wow we do have a Steve Bannon
[1:10:09.320 --> 1:10:13.520]  interview and that's great and we're gonna get that whole thing posted also
[1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:18.320]  up on band.video so you'll be able to see that in the last ten minutes or so
[1:10:18.320 --> 1:10:26.280]  that we did not get to earlier but hey I'm gonna reset here for a moment and I'm
[1:10:26.280 --> 1:10:31.960]  gonna come back and I've got the monkey pox news and the new roll out of
[1:10:31.960 --> 1:10:34.840]  lockdowns we told you was coming it's now been announced unbelievably horrible
[1:10:34.840 --> 1:10:37.920]  but at least we're gonna get ahead of it and get people ready to say no and not
[1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:42.400]  comply with the QR codes and of course inoculations and the masking and the
[1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:46.760]  all the crap that's coming back and then the latest carbon taxes that are going
[1:10:46.760 --> 1:10:53.280]  into place and so much more but boy did it make the corporate media go into an
[1:10:53.280 --> 1:11:00.240]  absolute total and complete hissy fit. Steve Bannon tells Alex Jones he's one
[1:11:00.240 --> 1:11:04.080]  of the greatest political thinkers since the founding fathers Steve Bannon calls
[1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:06.080]  Alex Jones one of the greatest political thinkers since the Revolutionary
[1:11:06.080 --> 1:11:10.960]  Generation. Now that isn't about Alex Jones tooting his horn from myself a
[1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:15.400]  third person it's about the fact that people know we've been right 95% of the
[1:11:15.400 --> 1:11:19.440]  time they know we're trying to tell the truth and they know that we're all in
[1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:24.640]  this together and now that you got all these people from from Steve Bannon and
[1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:30.000]  on the right and Glenn Greenwald on the so-called left and Joe Rogan came out
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:34.160]  this week and I had dinner with Joe Friday night with Eddie Bravo and Andrew
[1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:38.560]  Schultz and you know he just said really nice things they spent like 30
[1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:44.440]  minutes on his interview Friday with Andrew Schultz saying nice things about
[1:11:44.440 --> 1:11:49.920]  the show and how we were right and see Joe knows that they're trying to destroy me
[1:11:49.920 --> 1:11:53.520]  and he knows we told the truth so he knows saying nice things goes against
[1:11:53.520 --> 1:11:57.160]  their narrative of destroying people that are black sheep and mavericks it's the
[1:11:57.160 --> 1:12:00.280]  same thing with Glenn Greenwald the same thing with people like Steve Bannon that
[1:12:00.280 --> 1:12:05.040]  we have to stick together because yes we're telling the truth yes we're right
[1:12:05.040 --> 1:12:10.360]  about these things and that's why the system is coming after us. Do I agree with
[1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:14.720]  everything that Rand Paul says almost everything but not everything but everything
[1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:20.760]  that Joe Rogan says 95% but not all of it? Do I agree with Glenn Greenwald? About 80%
[1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:26.400]  do I agree with Steve Bannon? About 99% do I agree with Roderstone? About 95%
[1:12:26.400 --> 1:12:31.840]  the point is is that we have a right to say it and we have a right to do it and
[1:12:31.840 --> 1:12:39.200]  we know what's going on in our face and we're not going to submit to this
[1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:44.440]  tyranny and and and holding up and and defending individuals that have been
[1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:48.920]  chosen for destruction isn't just about saving Alex Jones or Tucker Carlson or
[1:12:48.920 --> 1:12:54.200]  others that are in battle and behind the scenes he's in battle it's about betting
[1:12:54.200 --> 1:12:59.680]  on people that bet on you and we have bet on you ladies and gentlemen and and we
[1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:04.040]  believe in you and I know you believe in us and that is a beautiful beautiful
[1:13:04.040 --> 1:13:11.440]  powerful powerful thing and I am just despite all the persecution and all the
[1:13:11.440 --> 1:13:16.640]  attacks and all the frustration I am extremely blessed to be alive on this
[1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:20.280]  planet today and to be in the position I've been in to take these people on so
[1:13:20.280 --> 1:13:25.600]  I am just extremely honored to be associated with all of you and to be
[1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:30.120]  associated with the movement of freedom and liberty and justice and a pro-human
[1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:34.240]  future so it's a very very very magic moment to be alive here in history as
[1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:39.080]  nastiest things are you know Newtonian physics for every action there's an
[1:13:39.080 --> 1:13:43.440]  opposite equal reaction we are the opposite and equal reaction to the
[1:13:43.440 --> 1:13:48.600]  tyranny that's who we are so evil exists but we exist as well so that's really
[1:13:48.600 --> 1:13:54.400]  the thing we have to understand that consciousness is a big deal and with it
[1:13:54.400 --> 1:13:57.840]  comes a lot of pain but also a lot of pleasure and a lot of discovery and
[1:13:57.840 --> 1:14:02.080]  exhilaration and honor and if you go through consciousness of being alive to
[1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:06.080]  the next level it's a good thing for those that fall to evil or those that get
[1:14:06.080 --> 1:14:10.920]  twisted you know caught in the trap it's very very sad but that's what
[1:14:10.920 --> 1:14:16.120]  consciousness and free will is all about and that's why the system is
[1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:20.280]  attacking it and so we talk about the the deepest thing Donald Trump ever
[1:14:20.280 --> 1:14:24.280]  learned was how to be shallow that just means go with the instincts go with the
[1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:31.880]  gut go with your understanding go with your spirit and 999 times out of a
[1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:34.960]  thousand it's gonna be right and the time it's wrong means you didn't
[1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:43.200]  interpret it right means you didn't go with the gut instinct first today I
[1:14:43.200 --> 1:14:46.000]  hardly ever do this I was just gonna run a rebroadcast all these big interviews
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:50.720]  because they're amazing and I thought I just feel like the files aren't gonna
[1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:54.680]  work today and I walked in I said the files aren't gonna work and it wasn't me
[1:14:54.680 --> 1:14:57.560]  cursing it I just do they're like oh come on the files are gonna work I might
[1:14:57.560 --> 1:15:01.640]  watch they won't work and see that's what I'm talking about I know when that
[1:15:01.640 --> 1:15:06.320]  stuff can happen it's really weird and it's like it's on so many fronts you
[1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:10.560]  all experience it every day you know what I'm talking about and that's the
[1:15:10.560 --> 1:15:15.760]  magic of this universe but it doesn't matter we're gonna keep fighting we're
[1:15:15.760 --> 1:15:20.120]  going forward we're not gonna back down and this is the animating contest of
[1:15:20.120 --> 1:15:23.360]  liberty and people love us because we're ragtag people love us because we're
[1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:26.320]  grassroots and we love you because you're ragtag and because you're grassroots
[1:15:26.320 --> 1:15:30.200]  and that's what's beautiful about all this but yeah the way the universe works
[1:15:30.200 --> 1:15:33.200]  synergistically serendipity all these big attacks are coming out against them
[1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:36.520]  full wars in America and you and your family right now but at the same time all
[1:15:36.520 --> 1:15:40.880]  this resistance like Alex's war the film and the great reset book and all of its
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:44.960]  hitting and so many other things at the same time this is a very exciting
[1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:49.880]  amazing time to be alive and discover and find out who we really are we'll be
[1:15:49.880 --> 1:15:53.640]  right back with a ton of breaking news stay with us
[1:15:56.520 --> 1:16:01.560]  so when I first started taking survival skill basically I was 275 pounds
[1:16:01.560 --> 1:16:05.600]  I was overweight I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding
[1:16:05.600 --> 1:16:09.640]  on to a job and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it so the first
[1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:13.440]  one I got was the original survival shield the X1 and it worked pretty good
[1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:16.640]  and then shortly thereafter you came out with that you had you know with a
[1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:20.000]  deeper source you know and I got really excited about that so I took it and man
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:25.200]  in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was
[1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:29.360]  enlightened you know I could think again I could connect with people again and
[1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:33.320]  over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I
[1:16:33.320 --> 1:16:37.120]  religiously take basically all of your supplements they're all absolutely
[1:16:37.120 --> 1:16:40.880]  amazing supplements the one I like recently is knockout literally like if
[1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:44.360]  you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point
[1:16:44.360 --> 1:16:48.080]  is we have to get ourselves clean that's a break free of the globalist
[1:16:48.080 --> 1:16:51.920]  system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand
[1:16:51.920 --> 1:16:57.560]  beautifully said brother I thank you so much for your call at Godspeed there is
[1:16:57.560 --> 1:17:04.560]  nothing there is no more epitome of free speech than right here and that's what
[1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:08.960]  people recognize and resonate with and as Ward said you're not gonna find a
[1:17:08.960 --> 1:17:13.080]  better place for information you might not agree with everything you might not
[1:17:13.080 --> 1:17:17.240]  agree with all our perspectives but we cover all the information and there's
[1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:19.760]  nowhere else really that does it like we do here I thank you for that word
[1:17:19.760 --> 1:17:24.600]  infowarstore.com by the way the products he mentions infowarstore.com is

[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:38.600]  supplements as well I mean look at the hair and beard support formula folks this
[1:17:38.600 --> 1:17:43.060]  is a joke I mean we're giving this thing away at 75% off by the way it
[1:17:43.060 --> 1:17:47.440]  works for me in case you haven't noticed the hair and beard formula is working
[1:17:47.440 --> 1:17:54.600]  for me quite well I might add quite well my barber appreciates hair and beard
[1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:59.360]  support for men I go and see him quite often now sold out for seven months

[1:20:47.560 --> 1:20:54.880]  child operators attack no I mean listen I got into this on access TV when I was 21
[1:20:54.880 --> 1:20:59.640]  years old and I but I meant everything purity I made a lot of mistakes I've
[1:20:59.640 --> 1:21:02.680]  done a lot of bad stuff it wasn't on purpose so it's great to be here with
[1:21:02.680 --> 1:21:07.440]  Greenwald it's great to be here with Alex Moyer and the thing is I didn't lie
[1:21:07.440 --> 1:21:11.640]  on purpose I made a lot of mistakes but I'm not some person getting orders and
[1:21:11.640 --> 1:21:16.160]  lying to people and we're probably like 90% accurate 10% wrong and I want to get
[1:21:16.160 --> 1:21:19.720]  better and so that's just where I met and it's great to be here and I'm glad
[1:21:19.720 --> 1:21:24.160]  you made a film that just kind of shows what we've done because I look at it's
[1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:28.560]  kind of horrifying obnoxious I am and then parts of it are good but I mean I
[1:21:28.560 --> 1:21:33.200]  did this from a peer place and that's at the end of the day like I did not lie
[1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:37.360]  to people on purpose I did make mistakes on purpose and I'm just glad you guys
[1:21:37.360 --> 1:21:45.200]  made this film so Alex let me actually begin by asking you a little bit about
[1:21:45.200 --> 1:21:49.720]  that in terms of your intentions and and the light because I when I remember
[1:21:49.720 --> 1:21:53.240]  when I watched the film it was just so striking this early footage of you and
[1:21:53.240 --> 1:21:55.840]  I remember when the internet first discovered some of the early pictures
[1:21:55.840 --> 1:21:59.920]  of you from your public access days in Austin I remember liberals being almost
[1:21:59.920 --> 1:22:02.680]  horrified like with this cognitive dissonance like we're supposed to look
[1:22:02.680 --> 1:22:05.800]  at him as a screaming spitting monster and yet these these pictures are
[1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:12.520]  disturbingly handsome in this like very mainstream normal way you obviously from
[1:22:12.520 --> 1:22:15.560]  the beginning had a kind of charisma a natural charisma in front of the
[1:22:15.560 --> 1:22:18.840]  camera that's what people even said from the first time they saw you and so when
[1:22:18.840 --> 1:22:22.400]  you combine these attributes that you had when you were young I think you
[1:22:22.400 --> 1:22:26.240]  clearly had you been somebody who was willing to affirm rather than question
[1:22:26.240 --> 1:22:31.120]  establishment pieties could have ended up as like a meteorologist on like Good
[1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:36.320]  Morning America or like some Anderson Cooper type and I'm wondering if you were
[1:22:36.320 --> 1:22:41.400]  aware of that potential and purposely chose to reject it for a different path
[1:22:41.400 --> 1:22:44.960]  this kind of path of misfits and outcasts that were surrounded by
[1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:50.840]  delightfully or whether it was just so natural to your personality that you
[1:22:50.840 --> 1:22:54.480]  never even considered trying to to pursue that kind of mainstream
[1:22:54.480 --> 1:22:59.520]  acceptability Glenn I was thinking about driving her today what I wanted to say
[1:22:59.520 --> 1:23:04.200]  and I forgot to thank God you brought that up no no no seriously no it's
[1:23:04.200 --> 1:23:10.400]  really intuitive my enemies say I'm this Lex Luthor mastermind and I would love
[1:23:10.400 --> 1:23:16.600]  to say that it's none of that I had no I could study the news and politics and
[1:23:16.600 --> 1:23:20.640]  read like books by which is bigger Brazilian like these were scary things
[1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:27.320]  but I had no training no idea no plan and the this idea that like I'm this
[1:23:27.320 --> 1:23:33.000]  mastermind it's in these opposite I mean I can't balance my checkbook you know
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:36.920]  and and so and I'm not trying to put myself down it's just like they
[1:23:36.920 --> 1:23:40.920]  literally think I'm like this evil mastermind and I literally can't balance
[1:23:40.920 --> 1:23:44.600]  my checkbook and they're just like attacking me constantly like where's
[1:23:44.600 --> 1:23:48.080]  the secret where's the Russians where's the who's giving the mercers who's
[1:23:48.080 --> 1:23:51.200]  giving the orders I'm like I was just covering the news I was just giving my
[1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:56.480]  opinion on something and so no I had no idea what I was doing I just was pro
[1:23:56.480 --> 1:24:00.760]  America and like have a libertarian and like didn't like Republicans didn't like
[1:24:00.760 --> 1:24:04.280]  Democrats and I was just watching all this happen I said God I don't access
[1:24:04.280 --> 1:24:08.120]  TV so I try to go to college and try to get an RTF job and they're like I'll
[1:24:08.120 --> 1:24:12.440]  take it five years even be anything in radio so I was like well I'll be
[1:24:12.440 --> 1:24:17.360]  access TV so that was it was basically I had my own political beliefs they were
[1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:21.440]  just pro-freedom then I got involved it was immediately successful and then I
[1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:25.240]  was like trying to like figure out as I went and I'm trying to be truthful made
[1:24:25.240 --> 1:24:29.280]  a lot of mistakes long away but none of it was with malice none of it was
[1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:33.240]  maternity buddy yeah we're gonna talk about the mistakes for sure in a few
[1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:36.680]  minutes because it wouldn't be a complete discussion without that before we
[1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:40.080]  get to that I just I you know the question of your politics I I think is
[1:24:40.080 --> 1:24:44.680]  so interesting and this is what was striking me watching the film is there's
[1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:49.040]  a the idea there's this idea you know if you ask somebody with what political
[1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:52.240]  faction or ideology is Alex Jones associated they would instantly say
[1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:57.160]  oh the far right and I'm watching you well before most people thought about
[1:24:57.160 --> 1:25:02.160]  doing it spreading huge amounts of skepticism and doubt about the CIA the
[1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:06.720]  US security state you're confronting the FBI well before Trump began spreading
[1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:12.120]  that kind of skepticism in Republican circles you even are talking about the
[1:25:12.120 --> 1:25:16.200]  NSA before 9-11 you're warning about the dangers of exaggerating the threats
[1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:20.640]  of bin Laden in al-Qaeda in order to kind of bring into a sort of authority
[1:25:20.640 --> 1:25:26.000]  authoritarian imbalance lots of things that people very associated with the
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:29.520]  left have been saying for a long time kind of opposing these institutions of
[1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:35.240]  of authoritarianism warning about how they exploit people's perceptions to put
[1:25:35.240 --> 1:25:39.840]  the population population in fear how have you seen yourself ideologically in
[1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:46.640]  and politically on the years exactly what we starting out like 95 96 first
[1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:51.760]  articles were like communist Alex Jones is anti-American because I was against
[1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:55.480]  wars and surveillance that just seemed like well Bill Wright says you don't do
[1:25:55.480 --> 1:25:59.560]  this so this is bad and I was just following Constitution really hand
[1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:03.720]  fistedly and I was like well I see all this news about this and so I wasn't
[1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:07.560]  even being right-wing or left-wing I was simply thinking I want to promote
[1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:10.960]  freedom that's that's a fun thing to do and so that's really where it came from
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:18.120]  and then and then that's why like Martin Sheen 18 years ago or so said I want to
[1:26:18.120 --> 1:26:23.560]  fly you out here to California and we want you to you know Milo Estevez's son
[1:26:23.560 --> 1:26:26.920]  we really love what you're doing so I get their house and it's like I'm sitting
[1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:30.160]  there and they're putting movies on like so you're really a good liberal right
[1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:33.720]  you're against these wars and you're in George Bush I'm like yeah I'm in George
[1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:37.400]  Bush and they didn't care that I was pro-gun or any of this stuff it was like
[1:26:37.400 --> 1:26:41.040]  I'm sitting there like oh Anthony Hopkins is going for dinner let's have
[1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:44.800]  dinner right now so but we're talking like 18 years ago I'm sitting with Anthony
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:49.400]  Hopkins eating roast beef and like like Martin Sheen's house in Malibu and I'm
[1:26:49.400 --> 1:26:53.520]  like what's this place I guess I had no idea like a private jet land splice out
[1:26:53.520 --> 1:26:56.440]  of California they're like you're a very important young filmmaker you're
[1:26:56.440 --> 1:26:59.960]  you're exposing the evil right wingers I'm like I just don't want to have a war
[1:26:59.960 --> 1:27:05.200]  I don't want to support these people are doing and so there was that and then as
[1:27:05.200 --> 1:27:10.280]  soon as Obama got in they're like boy wait a minute this is Obama and I'm like
[1:27:10.280 --> 1:27:15.440]  what I mean I don't like what about bomb is continuing the same stuff so to me I
[1:27:15.440 --> 1:27:20.040]  literally just went on access TV at like 21 years old got a local radio show at
[1:27:20.040 --> 1:27:24.720]  22 got syndicated at 23 totally self-taught and a ton of mistakes but I
[1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:28.960]  did it from a place of truth and then I experienced like Hollywood and what it
[1:27:28.960 --> 1:27:35.120]  does and the right wing and then just I had this great experience over 28 years
[1:27:35.120 --> 1:27:40.840]  on air of like seeing all the weird underbellies of all this stuff because I
[1:27:40.840 --> 1:27:45.840]  didn't come into it from the establishment I literally came out of access TV in
[1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:49.840]  Austin Texas and so because I wasn't part of any of the power structures I got
[1:27:49.840 --> 1:27:53.640]  to see stuff nobody else is saying so let me let me ask you the similar
[1:27:53.640 --> 1:27:57.520]  question that the one asked Alex which is you know it is a striking when I
[1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:02.320]  began writing about politics in 2005 liberals hated more than anybody George
[1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:07.320]  Bush the architects of the Iraq war I began writing in opposition to rendition
[1:28:07.320 --> 1:28:11.800]  and the torture regime and Guantanamo and due process free imprisonment and it's
[1:28:11.800 --> 1:28:16.480]  just so striking that all the people back then who were implementing it were
[1:28:16.480 --> 1:28:21.760]  advocating it are completely acceptable in fact be loved in mainstream liberal
[1:28:21.760 --> 1:28:25.280]  circles liberals watch media outlets and consume media outlets that employ those
[1:28:25.280 --> 1:28:29.040]  people as I was saying I could interview all of them and I would be applauded by
[1:28:29.040 --> 1:28:33.720]  liberals and yet you who back in 2004 were saying folks you're gonna hear the
[1:28:33.720 --> 1:28:37.000]  end of that question and Alex's response on the other side we're gonna
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:41.560]  continue on with that question-and-answer session that took place after the premiere
[1:28:41.560 --> 1:28:47.760]  of Alex's war which by the way was an incredible film absolutely amazing I got
[1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:51.200]  to attend the premiere but I will tell you the Q&A was almost just as
[1:28:51.200 --> 1:28:54.120]  interesting so stay tuned we'll finish up on the other side of Harrison Smith
[1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:57.440]  sitting in for Alex Jones stay tuned
[1:28:58.440 --> 1:29:03.560]  info wars has made history you have made history in your support of info wars

[1:32:59.480 --> 1:33:10.640]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:33:10.640 --> 1:33:14.000]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen yesterday was the world premiere of
[1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:18.800]  the new documentary alex's war and afterwards there is a q&a with glenn
[1:33:18.800 --> 1:33:22.360]  greenwald and alex jones and the filmmaker alex lee moyer we returned
[1:33:22.360 --> 1:33:27.120]  out to that q&a so let me let me ask you the a similar question that the one
[1:33:27.120 --> 1:33:31.040]  asked alex which is you know it is so striking when I began running about
[1:33:31.040 --> 1:33:36.760]  politics in 2005 liberals hated more than anybody george bush the architects of
[1:33:36.760 --> 1:33:40.880]  the iraq war I began writing in opposition to rendition and the torture
[1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:45.600]  regime and guantanamo and due process free imprisonment it's just so striking
[1:33:45.600 --> 1:33:50.560]  that all the people back then who were implementing it were advocating it are
[1:33:50.560 --> 1:33:55.400]  completely acceptable in fact be loved in mainstream liberal circles liberals
[1:33:55.400 --> 1:33:59.360]  watch media outlets and consume media outlets that employ those people as I
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:02.360]  was saying I could interview all of them and I would be applauded by liberals
[1:34:02.360 --> 1:34:08.240]  and yet you who back in 2004 were saying don't trust george w bush his father
[1:34:08.240 --> 1:34:12.760]  was the CIA director the the iraq war is based on lies all things that auto
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:17.680]  appeal to that sensibility of liberals you are uniquely castigated and kind of
[1:34:17.680 --> 1:34:21.600]  cast out of good company to the point where you're one of the very few people
[1:34:21.600 --> 1:34:25.640]  that even journalists are told they can't speak to why is that why have you
[1:34:25.640 --> 1:34:30.120]  been identified as such a threat in a way that other people who actually have
[1:34:30.120 --> 1:34:36.200]  bought on their hands and wars on their legacy aren't even remotely cast as well
[1:34:36.200 --> 1:34:39.720]  I mean that's the right question and I again only learn this one through
[1:34:39.720 --> 1:34:46.120]  organic experience of it but if I lied about WMD's if I kill billions of
[1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:50.120]  people I'm part of the establishment but they're they're not scared of alex
[1:34:50.120 --> 1:34:54.160]  Jones they're scared of populist movements and the fact that I wasn't left
[1:34:54.160 --> 1:35:00.720]  wing or right wing the fact that I was just pro-america and pro-freedom they
[1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:06.200]  really wasn't me they just saw me as like the American people and like okay
[1:35:06.200 --> 1:35:10.400]  this is what the American people produced this is organic because they
[1:35:10.400 --> 1:35:13.560]  wouldn't check out who I was knew I wasn't controlled they're like this guy
[1:35:13.560 --> 1:35:17.920]  just came out of the dirt and so this is this is the enemy and so it's their
[1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:23.120]  hatred of the general public their hatred of the organic grassroots it's not me
[1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:29.240]  it's their hatred of just good decent classical liberal Americans that want
[1:35:29.240 --> 1:35:33.360]  peace and want justice and want unity and want justice and want everybody live
[1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:36.240]  in peace we don't want to hurt anybody we're not judging anybody we just want
[1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:41.040]  to win our freedom and so that's what freaked them out like well this guy get
[1:35:41.040 --> 1:35:45.120]  this popular he's just some idiot on access TV what are we gonna do so I'm
[1:35:45.120 --> 1:35:49.640]  a symbol of their insecurity I'm not that strong they're weak and that's
[1:35:49.640 --> 1:35:58.840]  the scare up so you know it is it is interesting that the thing they hate
[1:35:58.840 --> 1:36:02.600]  most are people who develop influence and a significant audience without being
[1:36:02.600 --> 1:36:06.200]  captive to their structures and their influence and that is something that
[1:36:06.200 --> 1:36:09.400]  defines what you've done I think more than anything you came out of public
[1:36:09.400 --> 1:36:12.760]  access TV which was tolerated because it's supposed to be a joke that no one
[1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:17.080]  watches and yet you developed this gigantic audience and clearly part of
[1:36:17.080 --> 1:36:21.760]  why is because you have a kind of showman charisma kind of you know
[1:36:21.760 --> 1:36:25.480]  entertainment component to you that made people want to watch and one of the
[1:36:25.480 --> 1:36:28.680]  things that struck me was you knew you were talking early on in in in this
[1:36:28.680 --> 1:36:32.720]  funny episode about how when you were 12 you would see these preachers with
[1:36:32.720 --> 1:36:38.080]  Royce's and gigantic houses doing co-op hookers breast and whatever and they
[1:36:38.080 --> 1:36:41.240]  developed an audience because they had this similar kind of showmanship they
[1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:44.360]  were able to get people to watch and by the end of the film we're watching you
[1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:49.560]  talking about praying for president Bush and satanic influences in a way that
[1:36:49.560 --> 1:36:54.200]  see I'm just wondering no let's be honest I became the abyss okay but what is
[1:36:54.200 --> 1:36:58.800]  there up what do you notice that kind of similar no it's when you know I became
[1:36:58.800 --> 1:37:04.680]  what I saw but for a good cause but it wasn't on purpose only at 48 can I now
[1:37:04.680 --> 1:37:08.640]  see it no I was like damn that's a hot slut that preachers bang on his back
[1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:14.440]  porch that rolls Royce was pretty nice no I mean I mean I wasn't doing that
[1:37:14.440 --> 1:37:18.040]  consciously but yeah there's there's death I mean I'm not gonna lie yeah it's
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:23.200]  true I'm a preacher and and and so only now at like 48 last year the money whoa
[1:37:23.200 --> 1:37:26.480]  what have I been doing I've kind of like you know the things you get old you go
[1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:31.320]  damn what I just do you're like like damn I did all that like god a freaking
[1:37:31.320 --> 1:37:35.800]  horrible person but but then I didn't do it consciously the establishment is
[1:37:35.800 --> 1:37:40.760]  lying according to formulas I didn't ever do stuff on purpose and but I want
[1:37:40.760 --> 1:37:43.880]  to absolve myself I haven't done that much bad but you know I've been I've
[1:37:43.880 --> 1:37:47.920]  done some bad so that's very intuitive very that's what you said it's true I
[1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:52.840]  have I'm like it's just true I am the crazy preacher well that's that's why I
[1:37:52.840 --> 1:37:58.960]  put it in the movie Alex no I got the movie I was horrified I had to walk out
[1:37:58.960 --> 1:38:04.640]  five times you think I was sitting there like this was really great I look like
[1:38:04.640 --> 1:38:10.080]  job of the hut up there like on PCP or something but the difference is I do it
[1:38:10.080 --> 1:38:13.720]  on purpose like you know imagine the people that know this stuff and they
[1:38:13.720 --> 1:38:19.160]  go I like this yeah let me let me talk about January 6th it's obviously a
[1:38:19.160 --> 1:38:23.480]  prominent part of the film and I think one of the things people probably don't
[1:38:23.480 --> 1:38:29.000]  know I didn't know this until I saw the film was what a vocal effort you made to
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:33.480]  urge the public to be nonviolent at least because you knew what they weren't
[1:38:33.480 --> 1:38:39.440]  it would be strategic would strategically backfire looking back on on what
[1:38:39.440 --> 1:38:43.920]  happened with January 6th and and the fact that most people there did heed
[1:38:43.920 --> 1:38:47.880]  those warnings to be nonviolent but a few people didn't and they were able to
[1:38:47.880 --> 1:38:51.800]  take that and kind of spin this insurrection narrative out of it that
[1:38:51.800 --> 1:38:55.840]  to this very day is the thing they're trying to have shape the legacy of the
[1:38:55.840 --> 1:39:00.480]  Trump movement and Donald Trump itself do you look back on on January 6th as
[1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:06.000]  something that was a huge strategic error with regret or do you think that
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:09.320]  it's basically been immediate distortion that has taken what was
[1:39:09.320 --> 1:39:12.960]  otherwise a good event and turned it into something darker you know it's a
[1:39:12.960 --> 1:39:17.000]  paradox the cool Republican thing is to say we did a great job screw you
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:23.280]  Democrats but I had we had so many other events around the country and DC with
[1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:27.080]  like half a million people that I didn't expect it would go haywire I thought the
[1:39:27.080 --> 1:39:32.040]  police would be there and it would be controlled but it was a disaster and and
[1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:36.160]  then I get subpoenaed I spent a half million dollars lawyers in the last
[1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:41.200]  year and a half like with the federal government's FBI subpoenas is crawling
[1:39:41.200 --> 1:39:45.400]  all over us and they just keep asking we want the Trump meeting where he gave me
[1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:48.560]  the order so I even talked to Trump like a year before January 6th I'm gonna say it's
[1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:55.000]  the truth they have all my phone records and so so so I mean I'm mad that we got
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:59.680]  lured into that trap but the same time I'm more mad about how they said it was
[1:39:59.680 --> 1:40:04.800]  bigger than Pearl Harbor and big as 9-11 and Chuck Schumer's like this was as
[1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:09.760]  big as Pearl Harbor and 9-11 no dude 3,000 people died each event this is
[1:40:09.760 --> 1:40:13.840]  this not as bad as Pearl Harbor it was terrible and we just walked like idiots
[1:40:13.840 --> 1:40:17.440]  into the year in DC it's so massive and you're like well I expect the
[1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:21.200]  authorities are in command here we got a million people there and I just
[1:40:21.200 --> 1:40:28.200]  expected that the system would be in place and it wasn't and I'm mad at Pelosi
[1:40:28.200 --> 1:40:33.440]  trying to block Trump with his 10,000 troops I'm upset with Trump waiting you
[1:40:33.440 --> 1:40:37.360]  know over an hour and a half while all this was going on I mean I'm out there
[1:40:37.360 --> 1:40:40.760]  trying to stop what's happening and I'm also mad we learned was like a thousand
[1:40:40.760 --> 1:40:44.120]  feds and military were in plain clothes so I'm like don't go in the building don't
[1:40:44.120 --> 1:40:47.640]  go in the building if they just stood up it wouldn't happen so it's a very
[1:40:47.640 --> 1:40:54.920]  complex situation but you've had it all over to do it shows like we tried to
[1:40:54.920 --> 1:40:58.600]  launch a peaceful demonstration of our numbers to show we didn't buy the
[1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:02.400]  election which obviously look at Biden I mean I can't tie shoelaces he didn't
[1:41:02.400 --> 1:41:06.280]  win the election we were trying to show hey he can't get 10 people every day
[1:41:06.280 --> 1:41:11.880]  like campaign events at like a Chevy dealership like cars jeep right there
[1:41:11.880 --> 1:41:17.080]  and there's a there's a something over there and so we wanted a big number
[1:41:17.080 --> 1:41:21.880]  that's what Trump wanted and I just like a fool walking into that trap so it's
[1:41:21.880 --> 1:41:28.480]  it you know Glenn it's a complex issue but if all if I had it all to do again I
[1:41:28.480 --> 1:41:32.080]  would have just stepped back and said Biden just sink the ship and see what
[1:41:32.080 --> 1:41:36.240]  happens because man I'm not a revolutionary leader in like war I'm not
[1:41:36.240 --> 1:41:39.400]  trying to lead troops I don't have some weird thing in my head like I need to be
[1:41:39.400 --> 1:41:44.880]  a military GI Joe guy and but when you get a million people in DC it doesn't
[1:41:44.880 --> 1:41:49.600]  matter even if they're being manipulated you still your responsibility so I have
[1:41:49.600 --> 1:41:54.120]  a lot of guilt over January 6th because it could have gone really bad if the
[1:41:54.120 --> 1:41:58.280]  federal provocateurs had their way they would have the Q people would have
[1:41:58.280 --> 1:42:03.120]  actually kidnapped Mike Pitts and Pelosi and put them in handcuffs well we'd be
[1:42:03.120 --> 1:42:05.760]  in martial law right now because that would have been us capturing the
[1:42:05.760 --> 1:42:10.080]  Capitol that would have been the country going down the tube so we came in
[1:42:10.080 --> 1:42:15.760]  January 6th and closing was a dud it was meant to provocateur us into a violent
[1:42:15.760 --> 1:42:20.400]  event that was meant to get out of control thank God it failed and so I feel
[1:42:20.400 --> 1:42:24.120]  like I've been brought to the edge of death and so January 6th to be very
[1:42:24.120 --> 1:42:28.280]  serious let me ask you about the underlying cause of January 6th which
[1:42:28.280 --> 1:42:32.560]  nominally at least was the idea that there had been widespread fraud in the
[1:42:32.560 --> 1:42:36.040]  2020 election that Donald Trump actually won the states like Arizona
[1:42:36.040 --> 1:42:40.040]  Pennsylvania Georgia all right folks don't go anywhere stay tuned we'll be
[1:42:40.040 --> 1:42:43.600]  back on the other side of this short commercial break to show you more of

[1:42:56.840 --> 1:43:01.880]  the globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family to destroy
[1:43:01.880 --> 1:43:06.360]  heterosexual relationships to annihilate our marriages and the studies are all
[1:43:06.360 --> 1:43:13.200]  clear the number one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the
[1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:18.240]  bedroom and the number one issue men have is a rectile dysfunction ladies and
[1:43:18.240 --> 1:43:21.720]  gentlemen the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people

[1:43:57.000 --> 1:44:02.120]  the eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans they
[1:44:02.120 --> 1:44:07.320]  financed major universities they ran full-page stories and advertisements
[1:44:07.320 --> 1:44:11.200]  pushing their propaganda of New York Times other major newspapers that the
[1:44:11.200 --> 1:44:16.280]  family as we know it is a bad thing it must be ended and the first step in that
[1:44:16.280 --> 1:44:21.240]  is getting women out of the household teaching women that cooking dinner and
[1:44:21.240 --> 1:44:25.160]  taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing and I was
[1:44:25.160 --> 1:44:29.240]  just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter my four national daughter
[1:44:29.240 --> 1:44:32.360]  my wife makes dinner a lot of times but I like to make it as well I love to make
[1:44:32.360 --> 1:44:36.520]  breakfast and literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your
[1:44:36.520 --> 1:44:41.200]  family and be nurturative and then all sit down together and have the communal
[1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:46.520]  event and that's what the system is attacking and bombarding is our normal
[1:44:46.520 --> 1:44:51.680]  biological actions and coming together they really are sick evil scientific
[1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:56.320]  cult of filth and domesticate us and turn us into lab rats we cannot let this

[1:46:05.760 --> 1:46:09.960]  have all done these profiles you see it every year 30 different tax returns 30
[1:46:09.960 --> 1:46:14.040]  different answers 50 different tax returns 50 different answers and almost
[1:46:14.040 --> 1:46:18.320]  all of them just screw you over especially the big firms and the big
[1:46:18.320 --> 1:46:21.560]  tax groups because they're part of the system and they don't want the general
[1:46:21.560 --> 1:46:25.480]  public understanding this and knowing this so it's a very important situation
[1:46:25.480 --> 1:46:31.400]  with inflation all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do
[1:46:31.400 --> 1:46:34.960]  things tax wise it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your money
[1:46:34.960 --> 1:46:39.000]  we wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:45.360]  years the only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com
[1:46:45.360 --> 1:46:55.840]  one word jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-904-285 833-904-285
[1:46:55.840 --> 1:47:07.640]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:47:11.640 --> 1:47:15.720]  all right welcome back ladies and gentlemen without any delay we go back
[1:47:15.720 --> 1:47:19.000]  to that question-and-answer session and that was held between glennon greenwald
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:24.960]  and alex jones yesterday here it is about the underlying cause of January 6
[1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:29.320]  which nominally at least was the idea that there had been widespread fraud in
[1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:32.880]  the 2020 election that donald trump actually won the states like Arizona
[1:47:32.880 --> 1:47:38.720]  Pennsylvania Georgia and others and that because of fraud they had swung the
[1:47:38.720 --> 1:47:43.920]  rightful victor which is donald trump to Joe Biden there is a point in the film
[1:47:43.920 --> 1:47:46.680]  where you were talking about sandy hook and I thought something you said was
[1:47:46.680 --> 1:47:51.080]  very poignant which is anyone can kind of get carried away in their ideology
[1:47:51.080 --> 1:47:54.240]  where you start almost becoming so anti-established but I definitely feel
[1:47:54.240 --> 1:47:58.120]  this myself sometimes that you kind of want to cast out on the what the
[1:47:58.120 --> 1:48:02.520]  establishment is saying simply because they lie so often that you want to kind
[1:48:02.520 --> 1:48:06.200]  of make the point that these are untrustworthy institutions independent
[1:48:06.200 --> 1:48:09.400]  of the argument you're making in this case where you were saying there was
[1:48:09.400 --> 1:48:13.160]  widespread fraud did you actually conduct what you feel like is kind of a
[1:48:13.160 --> 1:48:17.960]  meticulous a forensic analysis of the voting patterns and conclude that there
[1:48:17.960 --> 1:48:21.120]  was fraud in these states sufficient to have swung the election or was this kind
[1:48:21.120 --> 1:48:25.600]  of an ethos like a way of saying that the establishment was so against Trump
[1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:29.560]  from the beginning in illegitimate ways that I'm going to kind of endorse this
[1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:34.800]  cause not because it's necessarily true in its particulars but more as kind of a
[1:48:34.800 --> 1:48:38.840]  thematic way of protesting no I mean I'll be honest which is the which the
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:42.640]  establishment doesn't do I'll be honest it was a yeah no it was a pre-baked
[1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:48.280]  deal that obviously vibes I need more votes of Trump and these and we saw all
[1:48:48.280 --> 1:48:53.080]  the weird you know anomalies and like Democrats blocking the windows and
[1:48:53.080 --> 1:48:57.280]  people like feeding machines full of things and so we saw some evidence and
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:49:01.200]  but we were expecting it and and so you can say it's kind of a foregone
[1:49:01.200 --> 1:49:04.080]  conclusion and we all went through a rose-colored dark lease but I think it's
[1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:07.960]  kind of 50-50 and then now in hindsight with 2,000 mules all those numbers come
[1:49:07.960 --> 1:49:11.920]  out I mean I think that obviously I don't think Biden got more votes to Trump but
[1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:15.600]  in a sick way it's better that Biden's in so we now get to see what these
[1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:21.200]  tabloids was really about but we expect election fraud right away and so kind of
[1:49:21.200 --> 1:49:25.680]  when you're a hammer everything's a nail I mean I think we distorted our views
[1:49:25.680 --> 1:49:29.920]  obviously and they'll say Jones admits he distorted views no there was evidence
[1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:33.840]  of the fraud and it got covered up and got suppressed but I'm not gonna lie and
[1:49:33.840 --> 1:49:39.680]  say we didn't I didn't distort my views in hindsight to what was happening yeah
[1:49:39.680 --> 1:49:44.840]  you know I think one of the things I think about a lot is the established
[1:49:44.840 --> 1:49:49.120]  media its function is to spread disinformation they like constantly in
[1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:53.560]  ways far worse than what you just kind of exactly I had met I'm wrong because I
[1:49:53.560 --> 1:49:57.260]  don't want to be a liar like them on purpose it looks rush to gate rush to
[1:49:57.260 --> 1:50:01.480]  gate being that I mean the for you know calling you a conspiracy theorist is so
[1:50:01.480 --> 1:50:06.080]  hilarious given that for four years the leading institutions of our country were
[1:50:06.080 --> 1:50:10.840]  insisting that the Kremlin had seized the levers of power in the United States by
[1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:14.800]  virtue of sexual blackmail over Donald Trump to sort of you know kind of like
[1:50:14.800 --> 1:50:18.960]  Robert Ludlow novel from the Cold War that would get rejected for being too
[1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:23.440]  stupid and banal that was like the leading narrative of our discourse for so
[1:50:23.440 --> 1:50:28.360]  long however when you are somebody who's standing against kind of establishment
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:31.200]  authority and establishment institutions you know that one of the things
[1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:37.000]  they're gonna do is seize on any mistake that you make so is is and this is what
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:40.080]  I kind of try and counsel people all the time who are trying to be dissidents
[1:50:40.080 --> 1:50:43.960]  which is you need to be a thousand times more careful because they can lie all
[1:50:43.960 --> 1:50:46.720]  the time and no one's going to call them out on it because they're on the side
[1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:51.640]  of the people with the more powerful megaphone do you feel like you at on some
[1:50:51.640 --> 1:50:57.240]  occasions have paid insufficient attention to the need not to hand your
[1:50:57.240 --> 1:51:01.320]  enemies really easy and cheap weapons for them to take and bash you over the
[1:51:01.320 --> 1:51:07.200]  head with 100% when I because I'm a 48 now and the last year has been learning
[1:51:07.200 --> 1:51:10.760]  process but I never realized how big to show us it's been big for 20 years
[1:51:10.760 --> 1:51:15.680]  really big for 10 and so I would just kind of like I would say devil's
[1:51:15.680 --> 1:51:20.000]  having at this that I'd say this is just a debate they will take out a context
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  and so when you've got that big a megaphone just because they're the ones
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:27.960]  editing it doesn't mean you still have a responsibility to not do that so I try
[1:51:27.960 --> 1:51:31.560]  to be a lot more careful now about things and my audience actually likes that I
[1:51:31.560 --> 1:51:35.480]  was just untrained and didn't know what I was doing so most of what I said was
[1:51:35.480 --> 1:51:39.800]  accurate and resonated with the grassroots but some of it was absolutely
[1:51:39.800 --> 1:51:44.360]  not right and it was said with so much confidence because I wasn't lying like
[1:51:44.360 --> 1:51:47.360]  when you're not you're not lying on purpose but you're saying you believe it
[1:51:47.360 --> 1:51:51.440]  people believe it because you're being genuine that's even more dangerous and
[1:51:51.440 --> 1:51:56.080]  and I think that's what it is and so unlike CNN or MSNBC or ABC or the
[1:51:56.080 --> 1:51:59.960]  New York Times I want to admit in front of the world that I'm not perfect I made
[1:51:59.960 --> 1:52:05.480]  a lot of mistakes and I'm trying to figure this out because as you get more
[1:52:05.480 --> 1:52:10.200]  power you realize well I'm really having an effect here and this affects people I
[1:52:10.200 --> 1:52:14.560]  need to really watch what I'm saying but then you see the very people lying on
[1:52:14.560 --> 1:52:18.600]  purpose point their finger at you and say you're a liar you're putting out this
[1:52:18.600 --> 1:52:22.520]  hip but I'm like dude I didn't watch all these wars I'm not lying on purpose I
[1:52:22.520 --> 1:52:25.800]  made mistakes and that's really what frustrates me is they still kind of
[1:52:25.800 --> 1:52:30.080]  moralized like to this high authority and they have all this stuff and like I'm
[1:52:30.080 --> 1:52:34.360]  trying to tell the truth and I'm and I get things wrong they are lying as you
[1:52:34.360 --> 1:52:38.680]  set on purpose and they think it's funny and so they're not my judge God's my
[1:52:38.680 --> 1:52:42.880]  judge my viewers are my judge and so yes I will have been in front of my viewers
[1:52:42.880 --> 1:52:46.800]  that I've been wronged I made a lot of mistakes and I apologize for them but I
[1:52:46.800 --> 1:52:50.000]  did it from a place of truth but I will not be judged by the New York Times I
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:57.760]  will not be judged by these people so you know I mentioned before I want to
[1:52:57.760 --> 1:53:00.720]  ask you a little bit about Sandy Hook I know the expectation is I'm supposed to
[1:53:00.720 --> 1:53:04.320]  come here and bash you over the head of us go ahead I know I have no interest in
[1:53:04.320 --> 1:53:07.080]  doing that I don't give a shit what the expectations are it would bore me if I
[1:53:07.080 --> 1:53:11.120]  tried you've talked about it extensively for people who are interested in it
[1:53:11.120 --> 1:53:14.520]  you've been deposed about it you've talked for hours about it people interested
[1:53:14.520 --> 1:53:17.040]  in the particulars can go watch that if they want I'm not going to jump through
[1:53:17.040 --> 1:53:20.720]  hoops in order to like appease people anger that I'm here I do don't want to
[1:53:20.720 --> 1:53:24.400]  ask you about a question that I'm actually interested in myself which is you
[1:53:24.400 --> 1:53:30.280]  know you have just you just said that that you have made mistakes obviously one
[1:53:30.280 --> 1:53:32.800]  of those is the stuff you said about Sandy Hook we watched you in the film
[1:53:32.800 --> 1:53:36.200]  come very clean about the fact that you made statements that turned out to be
[1:53:36.200 --> 1:53:40.240]  untrue you've obviously spent a lot of kind of reflective time it's like the
[1:53:40.240 --> 1:53:45.320]  soulful Alex Jones we got to see in the last part of the the film what is it
[1:53:45.320 --> 1:53:50.680]  that you think caused you to do that I mean you you reference some things I you
[1:53:50.680 --> 1:53:54.920]  know and I just identify with it myself that when you know people who lie for a
[1:53:54.920 --> 1:53:59.440]  living are telling you that you're a liar when people who are whose job it is
[1:53:59.440 --> 1:54:02.280]  to spread disinformation are accusing you of doing that you kind of want to
[1:54:02.280 --> 1:54:06.720]  dig in a little bit and and not give an inch to people who you know aren't
[1:54:06.720 --> 1:54:10.600]  criticizing you in good faith but what is it about kind of how social media
[1:54:10.600 --> 1:54:15.560]  works about how kind of groups function have you thought about some of the
[1:54:15.560 --> 1:54:19.920]  psychological and cultural dynamics that that led you to to make some of those
[1:54:19.920 --> 1:54:24.680]  mistakes in Sandy Hook well sure think of this like a thousand page book and
[1:54:24.680 --> 1:54:29.320]  in Sandy Hook in my life it's like a quarter page and then not putting down
[1:54:29.320 --> 1:54:34.120]  the kids that died or you know that stuff it's just like the I used to on the
[1:54:34.120 --> 1:54:39.440]  air go with take calls just be a call different show it still is but like ten
[1:54:39.440 --> 1:54:43.120]  years ago was like almost all calls like four hours a day so the callers all
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:45.760]  calling and say we don't believe this look at this so I go let's look at this
[1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:50.360]  let's look at that they kind of take pieces of that out of context and so
[1:54:50.360 --> 1:54:55.000]  here's a way to describe it fast forward to Jesse Small I do a Sunday show and I
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:58.080]  guess it was a Saturday night or wherever it was maybe it was a Monday show I
[1:54:58.080 --> 1:55:03.080]  forget but they say he's at 2 30 in the morning and guys don't bleach on him and
[1:55:03.080 --> 1:55:06.160]  put a noose over his head and say it's a matter of country and I already been
[1:55:06.160 --> 1:55:09.480]  sued for Sandy Hook and I said I don't care if I get sued this doesn't sound
[1:55:09.480 --> 1:55:16.160]  real and of course it wasn't real or or or or that that NASCAR driver Bubba
[1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:20.960]  Wallace they had nooses hanging in my thing it's like like you just know that's
[1:55:20.960 --> 1:55:25.360]  BS so a lot of us just I'm a talk show host so I don't go I'm journalistic and
[1:55:25.360 --> 1:55:29.720]  I have the witnesses and I have the proof and you know Jesse Small it's full of
[1:55:29.720 --> 1:55:35.240]  crap but I still went on air and I said the day after that but I said Jesse
[1:55:35.240 --> 1:55:40.720]  Small it's full of crap there's not dudes at 23 below zero running around at 2
[1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:44.800]  30 in the morning dumping bleach on black people get your fast kicks I mean
[1:55:44.800 --> 1:55:49.280]  like I mean you go attack black people building on Chicago you're gonna die I
[1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:54.480]  mean like run around to 30 the morning that ain't going on so so to me it's
[1:55:54.480 --> 1:55:58.480]  kind of like the internet doesn't buy anything it's told anymore because they've
[1:55:58.480 --> 1:56:02.200]  been lied to so much I mean take take take you vaulting I didn't say anything
[1:56:02.200 --> 1:56:05.720]  about you vaulting the hestate police said everything we've been told to lie
[1:56:05.720 --> 1:56:10.160]  we don't know what happened I mean project what you want on lies and
[1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:14.120]  incompetence in the 77 minutes stand down the police are putting hand
[1:56:14.120 --> 1:56:20.560]  sanitizers I'm Glenn I'm sorry it's a long answer what was the question what
[1:56:20.560 --> 1:56:24.760]  do you think led you into these kind of errors that you've been describing it
[1:56:24.760 --> 1:56:28.400]  led it going with great question it was just being on air for five hours a day
[1:56:28.400 --> 1:56:32.320]  you're very cavalier and so you you're not putting a journalistic filter on
[1:56:32.320 --> 1:56:35.520]  things when I write an article I would do that or make a film I was like getting
[1:56:35.520 --> 1:56:39.120]  every piece together those were pretty good films watch my films for 20 years
[1:56:39.120 --> 1:56:43.400]  ago they're pretty accurate but they're cavalier and like a friggin vodka and
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:47.520]  smoking cigarettes and like you know do whatever and you're like you're like
[1:56:47.520 --> 1:56:54.360]  yeah it's but fake BS man and like you're sued for it oh god so so and then
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:56:58.960]  once I got into that process you know once they came after me for it once
[1:56:58.960 --> 1:57:02.280]  Hillary made a big issue out of it it was a you know totally different ball
[1:57:02.280 --> 1:57:08.840]  game and and then what makes me mad is they misrepresented what I said what I
[1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:13.680]  did and then in the trials they have coming up starting next week they
[1:57:13.680 --> 1:57:17.720]  defaulted me and the judge in Texas issued orders forget Alex Jones let's
[1:57:17.720 --> 1:57:23.400]  say I'm Hitler the order says cannot mention First Amendment it's in the
[1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:29.560]  order cannot say you're innocent it cannot say it's a show trial incredible
