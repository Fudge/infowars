[00:00.000 --> 00:28.000]  It for Wars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  Welcome to this broadcast of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:31.000 --> 00:34.000]  I'm Mike Adams, the health ranger filling in today.
[00:34.000 --> 00:41.000]  And we today are going to do something that's never been done in the world on live radio.
[00:41.000 --> 00:48.000]  I brought my microscope. We have actual clots that have been removed from the deceased who, quote,
[00:48.000 --> 00:56.000]  died suddenly. We're going to be looking at these clots live here in real time under the microscope
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  and finding out more about what these are made of because it turns out these are not blood clots.
[01:03.000 --> 01:10.000]  I want to encourage you, share the URL, theinfowar.tv, forward slash Alex.
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.000]  Share that with everybody you can to get people live to watch what you are about to see here.
[01:15.000 --> 01:17.000]  And we have special guests coming up.
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.000]  We have a physician, an urgent care physician whose voice is going to be altered to protect his identity,
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  who is going to speak to us about these clots and how many people are presenting with these clots
[01:29.000 --> 01:36.000]  and they're dying. And people's fingers and toes are suffering necrosis and they are dying
[01:36.000 --> 01:42.000]  and they're having to have amputations. People's arteries are being clogged with these clots
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  which are not blood clots. They are what I'm calling engineered bio structures.
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  You're looking at one of the photos there.
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.000]  We're going to show you a lot more here on the show today.
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.000]  Again, a world exclusive. You've never seen this.
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.000]  And for those of you listening on radio, we're going to walk you through it.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  We're going to describe verbally everything for you.
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.000]  Harrison Smith is going to be joining me here in studio in a couple of minutes also
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  to help provide context and reaction to what we are seeing.
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.000]  We've also got embalmer Richard Hirschman joining us today as well as Dr. Jane Ruby
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.000]  later on in our number three.
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  This is going to be a show that you will not forget.
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.000]  And I want to mention that what we are about to look at here, I've got them right here
[02:24.000 --> 02:30.000]  although they are sanitized, these are bio structure clots that have been pulled out of the deceased.
[02:30.000 --> 02:38.000]  These are from dead people who are now going to speak to us through the science of microscopy.
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.000]  In essence, we have become speakers for the dead.
[02:42.000 --> 02:48.000]  We here at Infowars and across the independent media, we are the only ones left to speak for the dead.
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.000]  The dead could speak out right now, they would be screaming.
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.000]  Stop the vaccines.
[02:53.000 --> 02:54.000]  Stop the mass murder.
[02:54.000 --> 02:55.000]  Stop the injections.
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.000]  Stop the medical experiments on children.
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  And since they cannot speak, we must speak for them.
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  And that's what we are going to be doing right here today exclusively on Infowars.com.
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  And again, the URL to give out is theinfowar.tv.
[03:11.000 --> 03:22.000]  That would get you right to the live stream and you are going to see this unfold over the next hour with images that will be horrifying and shocking.
[03:22.000 --> 03:25.000]  It's not blood and guts, there is no gore here.
[03:25.000 --> 03:33.000]  But I just want to say a word of caution to those of you who are easily made nauseous or queasy,
[03:33.000 --> 03:41.000]  what you are about to see may be something that you want to, I don't know, look away at certain times.
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.000]  I'll indicate that verbally when that's about to happen.
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  But that's what's coming up today.
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  We've got also news about the economy.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  Markets are crashing right now.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  Crypto is getting hammered very aggressively.
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  Inflation is getting worse.
[03:54.000 --> 04:01.000]  And the dismantling of our nation is only accelerating through multiple vectors.
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  They are trying to kill us.
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  You know this, they're trying to kill us economically.
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  They're trying to kill us through bioweapons.
[04:07.000 --> 04:15.000]  They're trying to kill us with these vaccines, with chemical pollution, exposure, culture wars that are off the charts.
[04:15.000 --> 04:25.000]  They're trying to kill us, but I believe they will fail because we here at Infowars and across the independent media, we are resilient and we will not go down.
[04:25.000 --> 04:32.000]  And we will not remain silent even if it means we must speak for the dead as we are doing here today.
[04:32.000 --> 04:39.000]  We're also going to cover a little bit about Justin Bieber and his facial paralysis Ramsey Hunt syndrome as it's called.
[04:39.000 --> 04:51.000]  And Steve Kirsch from substack.com saying that he is convinced statistically 99% chance that Justin Bieber's facial paralysis was caused by the COVID vaccine.
[04:51.000 --> 04:59.000]  We wish a speedy recovery to Justin Bieber and I have some good news for him that perhaps you can pass along to him if you know him.
[04:59.000 --> 05:08.000]  A lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find out of the thousands of great items at InfowarsTour.com all the storeable food.
[05:08.000 --> 05:15.000]  So we've made it easy with our great partners that supply us with the highest quality storeable food out there at the lowest price you're going to find for good food.
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.000]  Prepare to day.com.
[05:18.000 --> 05:25.000]  Go to preparetoday.com and protect yourself and your family with what's coming and what is already unfolding with global food shortages.
[05:25.000 --> 05:33.000]  I told you over two years ago the global is going to have massive inflation and food shortages and it's happened just like clockwork.
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.000]  And I'm telling you it's going to get a lot worse. They have designed this.
[05:36.000 --> 05:42.000]  The way to beat them is to buy food now before your dollar is even more devalued.
[05:42.000 --> 05:48.000]  We are ready to ship to you right now at preparetoday.com and not just storeable food.
[05:48.000 --> 05:56.000]  Hundreds of the highest quality, survival and preparedness items in stock at low prices ready to ship to you right now at preparetoday.com.
[05:56.000 --> 06:14.000]  You can also use the URL preparetoday.com and it takes you there. Take action.
[06:14.000 --> 06:26.000]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show. Thank you for joining us today. It's Mike Adams here for the entire show. We're going to be joined by some very special guests.
[06:26.000 --> 06:37.000]  And also Harrison Smith sitting in with me in the next segment as we go live with a world exclusive, a shocking demonstration using live laboratory microscopy that I actually brought this morning.
[06:37.000 --> 06:45.000]  We set it up here and we actually have a blood sample on that microscope right now from one of the crew members donated a drop of blood.
[06:45.000 --> 06:53.000]  And we're showing you what that drop of blood looks like because what you're going to see coming up and this is again just an exclusive thing.
[06:53.000 --> 07:05.000]  Nobody else is doing this. You're going to see microscopy images at various magnifications of the clots that are being removed from people who quote died suddenly.
[07:05.000 --> 07:14.000]  And you've heard about this called sudden adult death syndrome, SADS as it's called. You've heard about people, you know, they suddenly died.
[07:14.000 --> 07:26.000]  And then the embalmers are pulling out of these people's bodies, these shockingly large, what I'm calling bio structures, they are referred to as blood clots.
[07:26.000 --> 07:34.000]  They are not blood. What you're seeing right now is blood and you're going to see the difference between that and what we're about to show you.
[07:34.000 --> 07:44.000]  Those of you listening on radio, we're going to be describing this for you, walking you through this and also encouraging you to make sure that you check the video archives at band.video.
[07:44.000 --> 07:53.000]  And also tune in at theinfowar.tv slash alex right now in order to watch this broadcast and see all these images.
[07:53.000 --> 08:00.000]  We're going to be doing it live again. I've got a vial of clots that were removed from the deceased.
[08:00.000 --> 08:08.000]  These dead human beings are going to be in essence speaking to the world through these images and this microscopy that we're doing here today.
[08:08.000 --> 08:11.000]  We have become in essence speakers for the dead.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  And what is the message from the dead today? It is a warning for humanity.
[08:15.000 --> 08:23.000]  It is a warning that says we must halt immediately all of these experimental COVID vaccines on a global basis.
[08:23.000 --> 08:31.000]  We must halt them now or many millions more may die. And what you're about to see will be absolutely shocking.
[08:31.000 --> 08:35.000]  You're going to be blown away by what is being pulled out of these people.
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.000]  And some of it is so large it's about the diameter of one of your fingers.
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  And these are not blood clots. You're going to see that coming up.
[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  First, we're going to cover the other news here.
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  The economic news is pretty serious today. Stock market is not doing well.
[08:48.000 --> 08:50.000]  It's getting hammered quite aggressively.
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  And also the crypto markets are getting hammered and this is actually a bit of a more of a shocking story.
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  Bitcoin fell about 15% over the weekend.
[09:00.000 --> 09:08.000]  This morning when I last checked it was 23,000 something which is down from roughly 60,000 at its peak.
[09:08.000 --> 09:16.000]  $200 billion in valuation wiped off the crypto market over the weekend kind of makes you wonder if they're really attacking crypto right now
[09:16.000 --> 09:24.000]  because they know that people are going to be working to flee the dollar because the dollar is showing its weakness
[09:24.000 --> 09:32.000]  with massive money printing and inflation and global economic warfare where the United States attempts to weaken Russia
[09:32.000 --> 09:37.000]  and only ends up causing more inflation and fuel and food in the United States.
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  So that news is happening.
[09:39.000 --> 09:47.000]  The crypto firm Celsius which is one of the major crypto firms out there. They give out crypto loans and so on.
[09:47.000 --> 09:53.000]  They have paused withdrawals and transfers now citing market conditions.
[09:53.000 --> 10:00.000]  This is basically the equivalent of the crypto world sort of bank freeze where a bank says, well, guess what?
[10:00.000 --> 10:06.000]  You can't come in and get your money out anymore because your assets are currently frozen.
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  So they're pausing all withdrawals and swaps and transfers between accounts
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.000]  and the statement there from the founder says, acting in the interest of our community is our top priority.
[10:17.000 --> 10:24.000]  This is a very concerning language and it's also sort of reminding me of what may be happening with some of the stablecoins
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  as the Evergrande situation unravels in China.
[10:28.000 --> 10:35.000]  So keep your eye on that and keep in mind that the powers that be do not want you to have any options
[10:35.000 --> 10:41.000]  other than their fiat currencies which are of course fraudulent currencies that are going to collapse.
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.000]  Okay, a fascinating story I pulled up over the weekend that you need to know about.
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.000]  You know the war on carbon dioxide is a war against life on planet Earth.
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.000]  Carbon dioxide is what grows plants, it grows crops.
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.000]  The higher the levels of CO2, the more easily we could grow food and feed the world.
[10:57.000 --> 11:05.000]  So at a time when the world is facing food scarcity and food inflation and real famine, starvation in certain areas,
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  especially developing nations, why are they pulling carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere?
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  They're doing that because they want to of course exterminate billions of human beings.
[11:15.000 --> 11:24.000]  Well another story that I found shows that higher levels of CO2 enhance plants' medicinal properties.
[11:24.000 --> 11:31.000]  And what they found in this experiment is that when you have more CO2 in the atmosphere that the plants are exposed to,
[11:31.000 --> 11:42.000]  you not only get higher crop yields, you get better plant nutrition and you get more medicinal constituents that are found in those plants.
[11:42.000 --> 11:50.000]  So when they are engaged in carbon sequestration, which is these large scale projects where they're sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere,
[11:50.000 --> 12:00.000]  and they're then dumping it underground through these pipelines and sequestration deposit locations located across the Midwest of the United States.
[12:00.000 --> 12:09.000]  As they're doing this, they are making the food supply less nutritious, they're taking away the medicinal properties of medicinal herbs,
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  and they're causing global starvation.
[12:11.000 --> 12:18.000]  So when you think about, quote, climate change and the desire to take CO2 out of the atmosphere,
[12:18.000 --> 12:26.000]  that is another form of global starvation, because they know with lower levels of CO2, it won't be able to grow as much food.
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  So that is another act of war against humanity.
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  Now let's move on to Justin Bieber.
[12:32.000 --> 12:44.000]  Now late last week Justin Bieber announced with a video that half his face was apparently paralyzed with this syndrome that he called Ramsey Hunt syndrome,
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  and his doctors informed him of this diagnosis.
[12:48.000 --> 12:56.000]  And I do want to, by the way, acknowledge the courage of Justin Bieber for filming this video and being transparent with his audience,
[12:56.000 --> 13:02.000]  and I want to say that we wish him the best in his recovery.
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  There's good news and bad news in this.
[13:04.000 --> 13:12.000]  So the good news is that often these facial paralysis syndromes are relatively quickly reversed.
[13:12.000 --> 13:18.000]  So there is a good chance that Justin Bieber may be able to resume his career.
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  And there's also some bad news.
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.000]  And the bad news is that according to Steve Kirsch, whose article says, and Steve Kirsch is on substack.com,
[13:26.000 --> 13:32.000]  why I'm 99% certain that Justin Bieber's facial paralysis was caused by the COVID vaccine.
[13:32.000 --> 13:41.000]  And in that article, Kirsch goes through a very simple statistical analysis and shows that there's only a 1% chance that this was just sort of like a bolt of lightning,
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  bad luck, spontaneous, out of the blue situation for Justin Bieber.
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.000]  99% chance this is a post-vaccine side effect.
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.000]  And if that's the case, then it's possible that it may take longer for him to recover.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  It's also possible he may not recover.
[13:57.000 --> 14:05.000]  Now, some people have lost their sense of smell or taste or sometimes other cognitive or neurological functions.
[14:05.000 --> 14:12.000]  They've lost them both upon exposure to the pathogenic gain of function nanoparticle SARS-CoV-2.
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.000]  And other people have lost these senses responding to the vaccine or, you know, after taking the vaccine.
[14:18.000 --> 14:26.000]  We don't know what's causing this for Justin Bieber, but we know that Eric Clapton came out and he told the truth.
[14:26.000 --> 14:34.000]  And he said, yes, that this vaccine caused almost a loss of his musical career, Eric Clapton's.
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  And he then came out and spoke out against the dangers of this vaccine.
[14:38.000 --> 14:44.000]  So I just want to say to Justin Bieber, this is an opportunity, Justin, once you learn the truth about what caused this.
[14:44.000 --> 14:51.000]  This is an opportunity to do what Eric Clapton did and to reach out to your many followers and help save other people
[14:51.000 --> 14:57.000]  from making the mistake of trusting in a medical establishment that is murdering people and injuring people
[14:57.000 --> 15:06.000]  through experimental, unsafe, risky mRNA injections that have never been proven to be safe or effective for that matter.
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  So Justin Bieber, we are praying for you. We wish you well.
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  And we believe there's a good chance you may recover.
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]  And we hope that you will find out the truth about what's causing this.
[15:16.000 --> 15:23.000]  And when you do share that with the world, many people could benefit from you sharing that information.
[15:23.000 --> 15:31.000]  Smithfield Foods in California is closing its pork plant, citing high operating costs, both inflation and fuel costs.
[15:31.000 --> 15:40.000]  One more shutdown of a food facility in California, adding to the deliberate shutdowns, the arson, and also the economic punishment
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  of the food industry by both the USDA and federal policies as well.
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  So folks, get ready. Mass starvation is being engineered.
[15:48.000 --> 15:53.000]  It's coming. And when we come back after this break, we're going to get right into the microscope and we're going to show you
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  what these clots look like up close and personal.
[15:56.000 --> 16:19.000]  I'm Mike Adams. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[16:27.000 --> 16:33.000]  And the prices are exploding.
[16:33.000 --> 16:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to protect yourself and your family and not be dependent on the system.
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  The time to be self-sufficient is now.

[16:59.000 --> 17:02.000]  The globalists are making their move. Their great reset is here.
[17:02.000 --> 17:06.000]  They're coming for your children. They're coming for the value of your currency.
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  They're coming for your national sovereignty.
[17:08.000 --> 17:13.000]  They're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny.
[17:13.000 --> 17:18.000]  They're coming for your free speech. They're coming for your privacy.
[17:18.000 --> 17:26.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, they're coming for your right to vote and have your representative and government that you and your fellow Americans choose.
[17:26.000 --> 17:31.000]  The new film, the seminal film, the most important documentary ever made in my view,

[18:45.000 --> 18:54.000]  So thank you all for your support. Please visit infowarsstore.com and get one of these historic shirts, hoodies, long sleeves, ball caps, you name it, while you still can.
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[18:56.000 --> 19:25.000]  infowarsstore.com
[19:26.000 --> 19:32.000]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[19:32.000 --> 19:41.000]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong.
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.000]  And they know in the end they signed on the God of this world who is a loser.
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.000]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep infowars on the air now more than ever.
[19:49.000 --> 19:55.000]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe handling.
[19:55.000 --> 19:59.000]  We are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[19:59.000 --> 20:27.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:27.000 --> 20:37.000]  So what are we looking at here?
[20:37.000 --> 20:47.000]  As I mentioned before, we have acquired these clots that have been removed from deceased patients who died suddenly.
[20:47.000 --> 20:53.000]  And the embalmers have never seen these clots before until the vaccines began to be administered.
[20:53.000 --> 20:58.000]  And the embalmer that provided these to me who is our guest today is Richard Hirschman.
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  So he'll be chiming in on this.
[21:00.000 --> 21:06.000]  These are the clots and I hope we can get maybe a kind of an up close shot.
[21:06.000 --> 21:07.000]  We can do maybe a yeah.
[21:07.000 --> 21:15.000]  But anyway, I'm going to take these out of the vial here and again live on radio and the video broadcast.
[21:15.000 --> 21:22.000]  I'm going to take these out and I'm going to stain these with iodine and then I'm going to prepare these on the slide.
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.000]  And then we're going to look at magnifications up to 1500 times and see what these are.
[21:28.000 --> 21:39.000]  And most importantly, Harrison, is that what we're showing on the microscope right now is a drop of blood from one of the crew members who donated this drop this morning.
[21:39.000 --> 21:42.000]  Just with a little diabetes, you know, Lance type thing.
[21:42.000 --> 21:47.000]  And we're going to show you that like that drop of blood is coagulating right now and there it is live.
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  That is very different from what we're about to see.
[21:49.000 --> 21:52.000]  That's a healthy, normal piece of blood.
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.000]  Yes, that is now dried.
[21:54.000 --> 21:55.000]  So it's a little scab.
[21:55.000 --> 21:56.000]  Right.
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  I could say it's like a one drop scab.
[21:58.000 --> 22:04.000]  And so for our radio listeners, the vial that Mike is holding, it looks like it's filled with little worms.
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  I mean, they look like little tiny earthworm looking things.
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.000]  It's really pretty gross and that came out of a human being.
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.000]  Well, yes, and these are only the very smallest examples.
[22:14.000 --> 22:20.000]  There are more vials I have that are some of these strands are the thickness of your finger.
[22:20.000 --> 22:21.000]  Oh, Lord.
[22:21.000 --> 22:28.000]  And what's happening, and you're going to hear this from our physician guest who's joining us in the next segment with his voice altered to protect his identity,
[22:28.000 --> 22:32.000]  is that these are blocking femoral arteries.
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  They're blocking carotid arteries.
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.000]  Some people are having to have femoral artery bypass surgery in order to not die.
[22:39.000 --> 22:46.000]  And these are on the smaller size here when these lodge near your hands or toes,
[22:46.000 --> 22:53.000]  they will cut off circulation to your extremities, which is called peripheral cardiovascular disease, typically.
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  And it can cause your fingers and toes to turn black.
[22:56.000 --> 22:57.000]  Now, there's a photo.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  Yeah, there's an up close photo of the vial.
[22:59.000 --> 23:06.000]  There's another photo for the producers that should show a man's fingers that have turned black.
[23:06.000 --> 23:07.000]  Oh, my gosh.
[23:07.000 --> 23:11.000]  That's what happens when these clots block blood circulation.
[23:11.000 --> 23:15.000]  Looks like a very extreme case of frostbite or something.
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  Exactly, which is the same thing as your extremities have lost blood flow.
[23:18.000 --> 23:19.000]  Right.
[23:19.000 --> 23:22.000]  But the thing is, Harrison, and I mean, you're welcome.
[23:22.000 --> 23:28.000]  I brought extra gloves if you want to get in on this, but I don't mean to joke about this.
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.000]  This is serious business, but these have the consistency of small rubber bands.
[23:32.000 --> 23:33.000]  Right.
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.000]  No, it's horrifying looking in person.
[23:36.000 --> 23:41.000]  Hopefully, it's coming across on the camera because it really does look like something from a horror film.
[23:41.000 --> 23:49.000]  And these were drawn out of somebody's veins who had died of a sudden heart attack or something similar.
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  And I was taking them out of the vial here now.
[23:52.000 --> 23:59.000]  And there's already pre-died ones, but we're doing this live and actually going to take the real thing and you say diet with iodine.
[23:59.000 --> 24:00.000]  Yes.
[24:00.000 --> 24:07.000]  Iodine is used in the standard gram staining techniques for microbiology along with violet-colored dyes.
[24:07.000 --> 24:15.000]  But what I found is that iodine, yeah, this came out of a living, well, a previously living person.
[24:15.000 --> 24:21.000]  And the reason this is important for us to study is because these people are dead and they can't speak.
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  Right.
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  We have to speak for them.
[24:24.000 --> 24:30.000]  And by the way, these samples have all been sterilized for anybody concerned about medical procedures.
[24:30.000 --> 24:35.000]  These have been sterilized with ultraviolet radiation as well as ethyl alcohol treatments and so on.
[24:35.000 --> 24:40.000]  So there's no danger to us, but I am wearing gloves as you might expect.
[24:40.000 --> 24:41.000]  Yeah.
[24:41.000 --> 24:51.000]  And folks, if you are a radio listener, you've got to get to Bandod video and see this and share this imagery because even just seeing this thing,
[24:51.000 --> 25:00.000]  this entity that came out of someone's veins, I mean, that alone is enough to convince you there's something very disturbing going on here.
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  So this is just iodine, folks. This is not blood. This is just iodine.
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.000]  Right.
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  And iodine is used for staining in order to provide contrast.
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  And then I'm just washing it with ethyl alcohol.
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.000]  And once this is done, we're going to go ahead and place it under the microscope.
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.000]  And that's to get the contrast so it's just more easily viewable under the microscope, right?
[25:18.000 --> 25:19.000]  Exactly.
[25:19.000 --> 25:25.000]  Again, kind of standard staining techniques, but usually used for microbiology.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  But we're just using it for these tissue samples here.
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000]  Now, I'm going to flatten this out with another slide because it's a little too tall.
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  It's pretty chunky here.
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  So I'm just going to kind of flatten it out a little bit.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  I don't know if you can see that.
[25:40.000 --> 25:41.000]  Yeah.
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.000]  And now we're going to go ahead and place this under the microscope in real time.
[25:45.000 --> 25:53.000]  Again, because the reason I'm doing this is I don't want anybody to think that any of this is faked or anything like that.
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  Right. Doing the whole thing live. My God.
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.000]  Yeah. So, yeah.
[25:59.000 --> 26:00.000]  Ooh.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  Make it that graphic right there.
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.000]  No, but I mean, but look, this is what's in people's body.
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.000]  This is what's being removed from people's damaged hearts. And you can see why.
[26:10.000 --> 26:11.000]  I mean, my God.
[26:11.000 --> 26:14.000]  But again, for the radio viewers.
[26:14.000 --> 26:17.000]  I don't know how to describe it. You got to just see the image.
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  Go back to the microscope image if you would please.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  Yeah, help describe this for the radio viewers.
[26:22.000 --> 26:27.000]  But we're going to start zooming in on this and we're going to get a lot more contrast and information.
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  I have to refocus as we move.
[26:29.000 --> 26:35.000]  But what I want you to notice about this, and again, this is coming out of people who were formerly alive.
[26:35.000 --> 26:41.000]  People are walking around with these things growing inside their arteries and blood vessels.
[26:41.000 --> 26:46.000]  These are massive. These are not the size of just one protein.
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  These are like billions of proteins.
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  And these are strands.
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  In fact, I want to show you something. Let me zoom out.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  I want to show you something that's just going to blow your mind.
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  If I grab this with the forceps here, you can see that on screen.
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  And I start to pull.
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  I want to show you how much I can pull and how strong these are before this breaks.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  Oh, wow.
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.000]  You see how they are fibrous and they are strong.
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  They're like rubber bands.
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  Right. And it looks like it has a consistency of, and I hate to even put it this way,
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  but it looks like something like raw calamari.
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.000]  I mean, it looks like some sort of rubbery seafood.
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  But not something you want to eat.
[27:27.000 --> 27:31.000]  That's a good description of raw calamari.
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  But understand that these are not clumps of blood.
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  That's what I'm trying to get across.
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  There's no way that these are blood clots.
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  These are, I call them engineered biostructures.
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  Right.
[27:42.000 --> 27:50.000]  So something in people's bodies is programming them to build these biostructures inside their arteries.
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  And for anyone watching who is skeptical, they might think,
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  no, those look like blood vessels.
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  You must have taken the blood vessels or the capillaries.
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  No, this is inside the blood vessels.
[28:01.000 --> 28:07.000]  And I mean, I can just tell from the sort of rubbery consistency of it, it's not blood.
[28:07.000 --> 28:13.000]  I mean, it clearly is something, I mean, it doesn't look natural to me.
[28:13.000 --> 28:21.000]  It looks like seafood, like raw sort of, I don't know, squid parts.
[28:21.000 --> 28:29.000]  Let me show you now that here's, I stained these yesterday using a different staining technique.
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  But we're about to go to break.
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.000]  When we come back, I'm going to show you this because there's a lot more detail.
[28:35.000 --> 28:36.000]  Yeah.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  Yeah, you can see the detail there.
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  Wow.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  All right.
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.000]  I'm going to stick around as we do this live experiment here.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  Incredibly disturbing folks.
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.000]  Again, if you're a radio listener, I can only describe it so well.
[28:49.000 --> 28:59.000]  You've got to go to band.video and see the images we are broadcasting live as we look through the microscope into the depths of hell, really.
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  So go to prepare with Alex.com or prepare to day.com is in stock, ready to ship.

[29:53.000 --> 29:55.000]  I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen.
[29:55.000 --> 29:59.000]  One of the most important things you can do is get ahead of inflation now because the inflation is just beginning.
[29:59.000 --> 30:05.000]  Every single person listening to the sound of my voice needs to listen to me very, very carefully.
[30:05.000 --> 30:22.000]  The nestices are made the most important documentary in the U.S. history, 2,000 mules. That's not hype. That's the truth. The film proves how the deep state Democrats stole the 2020 election and how they're planning to do it again.
[30:22.000 --> 30:34.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, with all the censorship going on, it is critical to own the DVD with the expanded extras so you have it in your library so it can't be censored and so you can show it to your church, your business, your neighbors or just perfect strangers.

[33:25.000 --> 33:36.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. This is the Alex Jones Show. I'm Harrison Smith. I'm sitting in studio with Mike Adams who has this very impressive microscope array.
[33:36.000 --> 33:47.000]  And while it is a microscope that we're dealing with, the samples are not microscopic. The samples are actually fairly large, about the size of a half dollar piece or so, but just scrunched up.
[33:47.000 --> 34:03.000]  Most people understand the scale that we're operating at. So we just saw the sort of raw, undried and just slightly stained sort of fresh sample, but now we have something else that we're looking at here, Mike.
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  What are we seeing on the screen now?
[34:05.000 --> 34:11.000]  Yes, so we're showing this is another clot that was removed from, again, from a formerly living person.
[34:11.000 --> 34:17.000]  And I understand that if you're looking at this right now, you think it's maybe a piece of dried chicken jerky or something. It is not.
[34:17.000 --> 34:28.000]  This came out of a living person, a formerly living person's blood vessels or arteries. And I've only stained this one with iodine, which explains why the color is more yellowish and not purplish.
[34:28.000 --> 34:42.000]  But this one has what appears to be what I would call a kind of a wire type of substance. We're going to zoom in on that. And I want your reaction, Harrison, to here. Let me let me zoom in.
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  What you think this is there. You see that.
[34:44.000 --> 34:50.000]  Oh, wow. Yeah, that is made of repeating patterns.
[34:50.000 --> 34:58.000]  And if the producers could show the images, this is from folder number seven. These are repeating patterns at the very high resolution.
[34:58.000 --> 35:07.000]  They look like almost reptilian scale on the side. And yeah, there you go. Right. See those reptilian scales.
[35:07.000 --> 35:17.000]  So the the the actual material that we're looking at, it looks like dried meat. It looks almost like prosciutto or something because it's dried and because it's been stained with iodine.
[35:17.000 --> 35:27.000]  But on top of that, is this thin? I mean, it looks like hair to me. It looks like images you've seen of, you know, from from crime scenes or whatever, where they zoom in on the hair to identify it.
[35:27.000 --> 35:35.000]  It looks like a human hair. It's a very thin sort of tubular structure that is about as thick. It looks like it's about as thick as a human hair.
[35:35.000 --> 35:42.000]  Well, it is just just to avoid any confusion. This is definitely not hair. Right.
[35:42.000 --> 35:56.000]  It came out of a person's blood vessels. Right. So what happens is when the embalmer is pushing embalming fluid into someone's arteries, and then blood is coming out sometimes with clots, sometimes slightly congealed.
[35:56.000 --> 36:07.000]  But these things are what's coming out of people now. These clots that we're looking at here. And this hair like fiber, which is kind of like a wire.
[36:07.000 --> 36:16.000]  To me, it doesn't look like a hair under the microscope because I've looked at a lot of hair and the hairs don't normally have these kinds of repeating structures. Interesting.
[36:16.000 --> 36:28.000]  And if you go to very, very high resolution, which is very difficult to focus, you're actually going to see structures in here that look like scaly, you know, skin like. Right.
[36:28.000 --> 36:42.000]  Which is very different because hair normally has these linear fibers, but not cross sections like this. So what I'm saying is that looking at this is shocking to me because, number one, none of this belongs in the human body.
[36:42.000 --> 36:54.000]  Right. This is being found in in people who have, quote, died suddenly and embalmers have never seen these things until after the vaccine started being given to people.
[36:54.000 --> 37:05.000]  I'm telling you, it's horrific seeing it in person. I hope it's coming across, you know, the television screens because it's real. It's like it's just disturbing.
[37:05.000 --> 37:15.000]  It's a disturbing thing to see. It's clearly not natural. Yeah, it doesn't look like human hair. It almost looks glass like or I don't know if crystalline is the is an appropriate word.
[37:15.000 --> 37:22.000]  But it certainly doesn't look like the rest of the material. It's something else entirely.
[37:22.000 --> 37:34.000]  We're looking at a live microscope feed here just for those radio or TV listeners. And that's why I'm manipulating this and the focus is going in and out because I'm changing lenses and so on.
[37:34.000 --> 37:46.000]  Right. This is not something prerecorded or done a lot or, you know, allowed somewhere else. This is we're looking at this live and manipulating the microscope here live and are we at what's the zoom that we're at here.
[37:46.000 --> 37:59.000]  We're at 75 X right now. I want to show you you see this white spot in the middle here. Right. One of our guests is going to talk about this how they're some of the blood that comes out of these people appears to be somewhat chalky.
[37:59.000 --> 38:11.000]  And we're seeing these strange white particles and there's there they are in focus right now and will increase the magnification. But these resisted staining.
[38:11.000 --> 38:18.000]  Whatever these are, not normal biological cells, which would be staying, you can see everything else here in the clock has been stained. Right.
[38:18.000 --> 38:26.000]  But these white particles, they have almost a crystalline type of structure. I'll zoom in even more here, which will be a challenge. But right.
[38:26.000 --> 38:33.000]  So with the staining, it almost takes it almost takes on a bark like color. And yeah, it looks like jerky or prosciutto.
[38:33.000 --> 38:42.000]  I mean, it looks like some sort of dried meat. But but then there's this white speck that almost looks like to me, just like a speck of salt or something.
[38:42.000 --> 38:50.000]  But clearly, it's not that it's almost crystalline structure. Or you could say perhaps it's a polymer, maybe a micro plastic particle or something.
[38:50.000 --> 38:59.000]  But these are being seen in the blood that's coming out of people who died suddenly. In fact, we're going to bring in our guest shortly who's standing by.
[38:59.000 --> 39:08.000]  But this is not normal. These are not blood clots. And just for comparison, again, I want to let me put the blood sample actually on here.
[39:08.000 --> 39:14.000]  And so that that that little white chunk, that is microscopic. I mean, that's that's a tiny thing that you almost can't see with the human eye.
[39:14.000 --> 39:21.000]  But the microscope can't see with the human eye. You can see this little tiny white spot on top of this normal blood looks like this.
[39:21.000 --> 39:31.000]  OK, and that's just dried blood. Right, right. You notice it doesn't have strands. It doesn't have fibers. It doesn't have, you know, twisty, turny tentacles or anything like that.
[39:31.000 --> 39:40.000]  No, yeah, that's like blood blood, right. And that's a blood. That's a little blood clot effectively because it's just congealed, right, scabbed blood.
[39:40.000 --> 39:50.000]  So that's the difference, folks. And that's what I wanted to show here today. Now we got to bring in our doctor who is here with a voice changer in order to protect his identity.
[39:50.000 --> 39:55.000]  Can we just can we confirm that he's with us right now?
[39:55.000 --> 40:01.000]  OK, doctor, can you can you hear me and have you been able to see some of these images?
[40:01.000 --> 40:10.000]  Yeah, I can hear you. I can't see these images on the road right now, but I saw what you sent me yesterday.
[40:10.000 --> 40:20.000]  And I discussed with you a couple of months ago about some of the experiments I did and we don't have to talk about that right now.
[40:20.000 --> 40:32.000]  But apparently what's happening is these injections are reprogramming or DNA or RNA to produce these new proteins that form these blue structures.
[40:32.000 --> 40:44.000]  What prompted me to call you was that we're seeing huge influx of people that are coming into the hospital and urgent care with what we call chronication,
[40:44.000 --> 40:59.000]  which is usually from frontal vascular disease or frontal artery disease, which are blockages in the, excuse me, in their extremities that can cause tissues with blood flow to your tissue.
[40:59.000 --> 41:07.000]  And we're seeing a huge skyrocketing in the amount of patients that are that we're seeing that have these types of issues.
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.000]  So are these in the one picture I showed?
[41:09.000 --> 41:17.000]  Sorry to interrupt, but are these did you see any of this before the vaccines started or was it very rare before that?
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.000]  Or what's what's the difference between, you know, three years ago versus today in terms of the numbers?
[41:22.000 --> 41:32.000]  I wouldn't say it's rare, but it's not to this extent. This is skyrocketed and we're seeing it in relatively young patients, which is unheard of.
[41:32.000 --> 41:40.000]  We're seeing this in people in their 40s, 50s, 60s. When you start getting into your 70s and 80s, that's when you start having some issues.
[41:40.000 --> 41:48.000]  It's relatively rare, but people with heart disease, usually these people that we see with these problems, we know have heart disease.
[41:48.000 --> 41:53.000]  Because if you have blockages in your heart, you're going to have blockages in your other extremities.
[41:53.000 --> 42:00.000]  So those are the types of patients we usually see this in. We're seeing this in patients that have never had any of these problems.
[42:00.000 --> 42:08.000]  So as you were talking there, doctor, and I'm just going to call you doctor, you know, we're protecting your identity and I appreciate you being willing to come on.
[42:08.000 --> 42:14.000]  We were just showing for the video viewers a massive clot that was pulled out of someone's carotid artery.
[42:14.000 --> 42:29.000]  It was about the diameter of a human finger. And my question to you is, are you seeing other symptoms of people having arterial blockage or requiring arterial bypass surgery, things like that?
[42:29.000 --> 42:46.000]  Yes, we are. There's a procedure called BEMPOP, which is a thermal ophthalmial artery bypass. One of the hospitals that I work with, that's a vascular surgery service is bought for months for these type of procedures.
[42:46.000 --> 42:51.000]  So they're artificially bypassing the ones that are clogged up in order to...
[42:51.000 --> 42:59.000]  We've got to go to break. We'll be right back after this break. Stay with us. Sorry to interrupt you. We'll be right back. Alex Jones Show.
[43:22.000 --> 43:30.000]  It's now out in the open. Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the Earth, the Bilderberg Group founded Davos Group.
[43:30.000 --> 43:38.000]  So now the fight's out in the open. They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule. We're going to win this thing.
[43:38.000 --> 43:47.000]  God's watching the children counting on us. I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[43:47.000 --> 43:53.000]  So I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[43:53.000 --> 43:59.000]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.

[46:05.000 --> 46:15.000]  Dinesh D'Souza made the most important documentary in U.S. history. 2,000 mules. That's not hype. That's the truth.
[46:15.000 --> 46:22.000]  The film proves how the deep state Democrats stole the 2020 election and how they're planning to do it again.
[46:22.000 --> 46:35.000]  Now ladies and gentlemen, with all the censorship going on, it is critical to own the DVD with the expanded extras so you have it in your library so it can't be censored and so you can show it to your church, your business, your neighbors or just perfect strangers.

[47:11.000 --> 47:33.000]  All right, continuing here, I want to thank you for joining me today on the Alex Jones Show exclusive broadcasts of the, what I'm calling biostructures, these are the so-called clots that are being pulled out of people's bodies after they spontaneously expire.
[47:33.000 --> 47:50.000]  And as you saw with the microscope, I want to thank Harrison for sitting in there. These clots are not blood clots. These are structures. These are complex structures that have strands and that even have a tensile strength like little small rubber bands.
[47:50.000 --> 48:05.000]  And to our physician who is joining us now, he is an urgent care doctor. He has chosen not to reveal his identity for obvious purposes, but you will note from his language and vocabulary that he is a practicing physician.
[48:05.000 --> 48:21.000]  And to the doctor, again, thank you for taking the time to join us today. And I want to ask you, because this is something you told me privately that I want to share publicly, you are seeing that these clots are not responding to normal clot drug interventions such as Coumadin and Heperman.
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.000]  Is that correct? You want to add to that?
[48:25.000 --> 48:40.000]  Yeah, that is correct. So these people were seeing increased rates of deep pain for embosses, which are fontanel or extremities that can travel through the lung and cause pulmonary embolism.
[48:40.000 --> 48:54.000]  And we're seeing increased rates of that as well, and then relatively young people. And the treatment for this is separate and Coumadin, some of the newer medications are also eloquent.
[48:54.000 --> 49:07.000]  And these clots are not responding to these medications. So it's using a different pathway to cause these clots, or it's a completely different protein, and these are not blood clots.
[49:07.000 --> 49:14.000]  So this absolutely supports what you're saying about these clots. This has nothing to do with the blood.
[49:14.000 --> 49:30.000]  That's what's shocking about this. As you just said, these are not blood clots, and we've proven that under the microscope. These are not congealed blood. This is not just cross leaking of blood elements, scabbing and clotting, nothing of that kind.
[49:30.000 --> 49:39.000]  These are structures. These are large structures that are taking up space inside the arteries, and apparently they are growing larger over time.
[49:39.000 --> 49:58.000]  So do you think, in your opinion, would it be fair to say that there is an unknown number of people walking around right now with these structures growing inside their own bodies who have yet to become symptomatic or yet to present to an urgent care or an ER facility?
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  Would that be a fair assessment of the situation?
[50:01.000 --> 50:12.000]  Absolutely. From what I'm seeing, the patterns that I'm seeing, because physicians, we like to look for patterns, and there's definitely a pattern that's getting worse.
[50:12.000 --> 50:21.000]  Either people are noticing that sometimes they might be a little short of breath or their legs might be aching if they take a walk. They might be a little dizzy.
[50:21.000 --> 50:31.000]  They might have elevated blood pressure because when your vessels can't, the blood's not being pumped in there, it's like a pipe. If you're getting some restrictions, that's going to cause your blood pressure to increase.
[50:31.000 --> 50:40.000]  There's a lot of different systems that people might be experiencing and they haven't gotten to the threshold of causing them to get treatment.
[50:40.000 --> 50:49.000]  Even if they did, unless doctors know what they're doing and they're looking for this, they might miss this, they say.
[50:49.000 --> 51:04.000]  Absolutely. I want to remind our audience, especially our radio audience, to bear with us because we're using a voice-changing technology in order to protect the identity of our guest right now who is a practicing physician, an urgent care physician who has seen these issues firsthand.
[51:04.000 --> 51:17.000]  I also want to encourage you, if you want to share this, to tell others to tune in because there's a lot more coming up today. The URL is theinfowar.tv forward slash alex that will get you right to the live show.
[51:17.000 --> 51:30.000]  Now, to our guest physician, again, I want to thank you for joining us. I've got a lot more questions for you. You're familiar with the term sudden adult death syndrome, SADS, that is now being used.
[51:30.000 --> 51:40.000]  I understand it's a medical term that has existed for a long time, but it's now being applied to people who apparently are dying from these clots.
[51:40.000 --> 51:52.000]  What are your thoughts on the sudden deaths that are occurring and are there any signs that people might be aware of where they could save their own lives?
[51:52.000 --> 52:02.000]  Just an early warning sign if they feel like they have a clot that is beginning to take up 100% of the space in a carotid artery or something like that. What are your thoughts on that?
[52:02.000 --> 52:18.000]  There's no such thing as people just dropping dead because of this disease. You're always going to die from another clot, and they're using that like a term to try to make people aware of what's going on.
[52:18.000 --> 52:36.000]  But the symptoms that we just spoke about, people need to start looking for shortness of breath, headache, blood pressure issues. This is speculation, but a lot of these deaths may be that they're throwing clots that cause heart attacks or the theory of thought that's causing a stroke.
[52:36.000 --> 52:54.000]  Something is causing these little pieces to break off and blocking a major artery or vessel, and then people, you know, the heart just stops or they die from a stroke. Again, that's speculation, but there's only so many things that people can drop dead from.
[52:54.000 --> 53:11.000]  Well, exactly. And let me ask you, as a practicing physician in urgent care, had you ever seen any kind of phenomenon like this more than two years ago, let's say pre-vaccine, was this something that you saw in a lot of people at all?
[53:11.000 --> 53:25.000]  I mean, pardon me if it feels like I'm pressing on this, but I want to be sure that what you are seeing is something that is relatively new, or at least the numbers are different. Can you just speak to that again, please?
[53:25.000 --> 53:44.000]  Absolutely. This is not something we've seen. I mean, every once in a while, you get an older woman that may have taken a plane ride or a long trip, and they had a blood clot in her leg, and then we would treat that or, you know, somebody would come in if they thought it was heartburn and they were having a heart attack, but that was rare.
[53:44.000 --> 54:09.000]  This is almost on a daily basis that we're beginning to see this. And my colleagues that have spoken to the hospital, they're definitely seeing this in the hospital, they're beginning to get filled up again, but younger patients that are having these conditions that was traditionally only seen in, you know, 60, 70, 80-year-old patients, and the age is definitely dropping down.
[54:09.000 --> 54:22.000]  So what is, where is this going then in your view? You're saying it's affecting younger and younger patients now, and that's what we're hearing from the media's so-called sudden adult death syndrome is affecting those under the age of 50.
[54:22.000 --> 54:36.000]  A lot of even, let's say, soccer players and sports stars are dropping dead in their 20s and 30s unexpectedly, otherwise very healthy people. Do you believe that these clots or biostructures, as I'm calling them,
[54:36.000 --> 54:45.000]  could they explain these, you know, soccer field deaths or sudden loss of consciousness by otherwise healthy athletes?
[54:45.000 --> 55:10.000]  They would certainly explain it. If you're cutting the blood supply off to your heart or to your brain, that would explain it. And they're asking like, this is normal, and this is just part of life, and this was unheard of. I mean, when I was practicing, I don't know, when I first came out of practice, I had a local high school.
[55:10.000 --> 55:18.000]  There was a student that dropped dead, he was a football player, and he had a hole in his heart that was undiagnosed, and he ended up just dropping dead.
[55:18.000 --> 55:29.000]  That is so rare that, I mean, I've never seen it up to that point, but now this is becoming commonplace, and that's, it's tearing the crap out of me.
[55:29.000 --> 55:35.000]  And the unfortunate thing is most doctors aren't even really paying attention, they're not seeing this.
[55:35.000 --> 55:42.000]  Well, that's what's extraordinary about this. Again, sorry to interrupt, but, you know, here we are on Infowars.com, independent media.
[55:42.000 --> 55:55.000]  Dr. Jane Ruby is going to be joining me later today, and she has been really instrumental in bringing all this together and allowing me to acquire these clot samples and to use the microscope that we have already shown here.
[55:55.000 --> 56:06.000]  But doctor, nobody else is doing this. I mean, the entire medical establishment is refusing to look at this. They're pretending that this isn't happening, and yet people are dropping dead left and right.
[56:06.000 --> 56:17.000]  And as you said, you are seeing an explosion in new cases. How long can this go on before the denial finally implodes in your opinion?
[56:17.000 --> 56:30.000]  That's a good question. I don't know. I'm so frustrated with medicine right now and the ignorance, either deliberate or by accident that that's happening.
[56:30.000 --> 56:44.000]  I don't think we can go much longer. I mean, we were predicting a year ago that there were some people saying that 70% or 80% of these vaccinated people would have been dead within, I don't know, a couple of years.
[56:44.000 --> 56:58.000]  And that was a serious thought, but now we're seeing this in real time. I don't know. This is not good. And we don't know how to treat this. I don't know how to stop it. I don't know if there's really anything that we can do.
[56:58.000 --> 57:15.000]  Well, but you bring up a really important point, and I got to say here, I think on behalf of Infowars, we demand a worldwide halt to all of these vaccines, especially in children who are now the next target for this until these clots can be studied until these vaccines can be properly tested.
[57:15.000 --> 57:29.000]  We hereby demand a worldwide halt to all of these vaccines because they are killing people and they are setting people up for future deaths via these bio structures that are growing inside their bodies as we have shown you here today.
[57:29.000 --> 57:49.000]  So we're going to be back with our physicians. Stay with us. We'll be back right after this break here on the Alice Jones show. I'm Mike Adams of naturalnews.com with my laboratory microscope here today. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this break.

[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  Alright, welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Mike Adams here filling in for the entire show. And we have our guest on the line here with his voice altered.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  He is a practicing urgent care physician who is also sounding the alarm on what's happening right now. Now, for those of you watching and listening, this segment isn't aired on all stations.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  So there's a big topic that I want to ask our guests that we will occur in the following segment, which is about the shortage of medical supplies that appears to be getting worse in many areas of the United States.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  But for the remainder of this segment, let me ask you, doctor, do you think that there is any intervention, first of all, that can, is there a way to detect these clots?
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  So if people are listening and they think that they may be growing these bio structures in their body, is there a way to detect it?
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  And then secondly, is there any promising intervention that you know of that might be able to maybe over time dissolve these? Any idea?
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  I don't know if any interventions at this point, because traditionally we would use, you know, the cruminine, heparin, eliquids, they're all to those medications.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  So I would ask for things like that. And for what I'm seeing, those medications are not working because it's usually a completely different pathway to cause these clots in cascade.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  I'm going to start trying to research this and what I'm looking for are potential options. But at this point, I don't know what to treat these people with.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  Now, there's not like a blood test you can get. There's not a simple test that you can get.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  They can do something called an ABI, which is our arterial brachial index, which compares your blood pressure to your lower extremities to your upper extremities.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  And if there's a discrepancy, that might indicate a blockage that's happening. You know, STQ scans, Doppler ultrasound, things like that, which we use for regular blood clots, may be able to detect these.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  But if this is happening, like I think it is in the small vessels, the capillaries, there's not a whole lot to do to really detect this.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  MRI, potentially, might be able to detect these, but they don't have anything to do with it.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  If you're a patient and you suspect that you have this, maybe you took the vaccines and you're starting to suffer some symptoms of this, maybe in fact impaired cognition due to reduced blood flow through the carotid arteries, for example.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  If you go to your doctor and say, hey, doctor, I want an MRI because I think that I'm growing, you know, biostructures in my blood vessels, that doctor is not going to, you know, order that MRI for you.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  You know, he's going to think you're crazy because they don't even really know about this that we're presenting right here today. So how can a patient even, you know, go ahead.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  Well, that you're absolutely correct. Plus, if a patient came in today and wants an MRI, if you're having some headaches or something like that, I'm going to have to fight with the insurance companies to get them to authorize the pay for that MRI.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  If you go to the ER, you'll never get MRIs on patients, or virtually never, because that's considered an outpatient procedure.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  So we've got to tell people what to do to try to get the insurance company to agree to pay for it. You've got to go through, you know, other scans or other, you know, CTs.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  We might get lucky to be able to get that. But get the MRI, which is what I think would maybe show a lot of this. It's only a fight.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  And it's just gotten worse over the last years since we've got Obama here.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  What about the D-dimer tests for, you know, microclotting or blood inflammation markers in the blood? Could that be useful in this scenario?
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  I am not seeing any correlation with the D-dimer. I've heard other doctors talk about it. That's maybe elevated. And that would prompt the CT scan of your lung to see if you have a blood clot.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  But that one, that's negative. If you don't have anything going on in the lung, we still don't know what's going on everywhere else.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  So that may be a good initial test, but it's not 100% either way.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  Okay.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  I just haven't seen any data yet to correlate that with these new types of plot.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  All right, so stay with us, doctor. We're about to go to break, but we're going to keep you from one more segment.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  I want to ask you about the medical supply shortage that you are experiencing. And I'd like you to name what specific supplies are becoming very difficult to acquire and why this might be happening.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  So please stay with us for one more segment. You're watching the Alex Jones show at infowars.com. Also give out the URL, theinfowar.tv forward slash Alex to watch the full show in real time. We'll be right back.

[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  All right, welcome to the second hour of the Alex Jones show here on infowars.com Monday, June 13, 2022. And we are joined for this segment by our sort of secret physician. His voice is being altered to protect his identity.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  And he's been telling us about the explosion in the clots that are presenting in patients via urgent care. And now I'm going to ask him here about the shortage of medical supplies that is getting worse because we're seeing a supply chain collapse affecting a lot of the medical industry.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  So, Doctor, could you please give us your assessment of what's running out that you are seeing and we're not going to talk about, you know, obviously what state or city where you work to protect your identity.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  But what are you seeing that's in short supply and where is this headed in your opinion?
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  So, I told you I got a friend of mine who's a fire chief that called me two days ago, panicking, desperate, asking me if I knew where I could help him get IV solution.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  He was down to 12 bags of normal saline solution. He was down to half a dozen or so of D5 solution and the IV flushes were, yeah, like, I don't know, 12 of those and he didn't have any IV tubing.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  And there was an allocation from his suppliers that was provided that to him. So, he said it's going to be like that for at least six months is what they told him. He was joking around.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  You might have part-time patients and the ambulance is with them to treat hypoglycemic patients.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  What I'm seeing is there's a major shortage in injectable steroids or if you come in with an asthma attack or if you have a poison on IV or something like that, we can't get the injectable solutions.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  I'm not saying this is happening everywhere, but we can't get it from our normal suppliers. There's a shortage on sterile blood.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  There's a shortage on the IV tubing, as I mentioned. Toradol, which is an injectable anti-inflammatory that we use, can't get that.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  It's just, I'm sure I'm missing something. I tried to prescribe several patients a couple weeks ago.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  Dipropoxin, which I like to use for urinary tract infection. No pharmacy in the city was able to get that. Now, that's changed this week. I haven't heard that this week.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  Let me ask you this. During the spring of 2020, right after the first real launch of the pandemic, we saw these kinds of shortages because China had spent the previous six months buying up all kinds of personal protection equipment, PPE supplies everywhere.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  Is this shortage that you're seeing now, is this the first real shortage that you've seen since 2020 and how does it compare to that shortage?
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  We were seeing some shortages of the gloves, but not the sterile gloves. We were seeing the general everyday youth gloves. We're seeing a shortage of gloves a little bit, but this is much worse.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  In addition to our suppliers, it's something that we haven't normally ordered, like on a regular basis. It's on allocation, almost everything.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  We can't always decide if we want 200 boxes of gloves because we're only purchasing 50 boxes, for instance. They're really restricting what we can get.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  So what happens to paramedics and EMTs and ER docs and so on? What happens if you can't get saline solution, you can't get dextrose solution, you can't get sterile gloves, you can't get IV tubing? What do you do at that point?
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  That's a good question. There's other types of fluids that we can maybe stop super at. In the meantime, we're trying to play black ball a little bit and try to fix that.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  But I think it's beginning to get to the point that we're going to have a major crisis here.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  I don't see a solution because most of the stuff, as you said, we used to get from China. We got 80% of our runs from China.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  And we're just not able to get these down. And I think there was enough supply in the chain right now to try to cover that up and try to mask it a little bit.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  But we're beginning to get to the point that they can't do that anymore. Now that's a really scary thought.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  So would you put this in the category of a medical supply chain crisis? I mean, would you use the word crisis at this point?
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  Absolutely. And just because you can go today, you'll come to see me and I can give you a liter of fluid.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  I still consider it a crisis because I know I can't order that. And like my fire chief, he's desperate. He doesn't know what he's going to do.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  So you may get delayed. Now the hospitals might still be able to get it a little bit.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  But so if you're bleeding out and you need to stay alive for a little bit to get something in you before you get blood, which we would use fluid to that situation, you may not be able to get that.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  You may not survive the blood to the hospital. This is the type of situation that we're in now.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  Well, this is extremely concerning. And many people believe that these shortages are being engineered. Others believe that it's just, I don't know, incompetence or problems with logistics.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  But more and more, it seems to be engineered. Your final thoughts, Doctor, before we let you go today, I want to thank you in advance for sharing your time and knowledge with us.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  It takes a lot of courage to speak out publicly on these issues. What are your final thoughts today?
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  I just pray that something can intervene, someone can intervene to realize what's happening because we're at this very early stage of a huge crisis in medicine that it's just about to get a lot worse.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  And we didn't even get the chance to speak about the staffing issue in the nursing home situation where they can't get enough people to take care of their loved ones in the nursing home setting.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  We're in a really big crisis, and I don't know what the solution is.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  Everybody just needs to pray and start talking to their legislators, and I don't know what can be done. It's going to take years to fix this, I think.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  Well, it's going to take years, it seems like, even for all of this to roll out in terms of, you know, if young children are being injected right now, and if these mRNA instructions are ordering their bodies to build these bio structures in their arteries and blood vessels,
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  that process can happen over several years, seemingly, and that would mean that we have already initiated what will be a long-term medical crisis involving younger and younger patients, and by the time the establishment perhaps acknowledges what's happening,
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  we may have millions of people already on the countdown clock to clot death.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  Your thoughts? I agree with that, and it seems to be an accumulative effect, so if you made a mistake and got a vaccine, you don't panic, or your loved ones did just try to encourage anybody that's thinking about getting to not get any more of it.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  In the meantime, people like you and me and others that are the heroes of this, I think, are trying to work on solutions that may try to reverse this or mitigate the effect.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  Okay, well, I agree with you, and I want to thank you for taking the time today, Doctor. You have a lot of courage to speak out, and thank you for spreading this word of alarm around the world.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  Now, as we were just talking about the medical supply chain breaking down there, folks, you've got to understand, if you don't get prepared right now, you're going to be caught flat-footed.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  You're going to run out of food. I mean, the situation is becoming dire.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  Infowars has a new preparedness website. It's called preparetoday.com, and at this site is a collection of different kinds of preparedness items, including food and other preparedness gear.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  I strongly urge you to get serious about your preparedness, if not already, and if you have taken steps, consider doubling down on that while also supporting this broadcast.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  I would not be able to be here doing this for you, if not for the infrastructure that Alex Jones at Infowars has built here thanks to your support.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  So go to preparetoday.com. I also want to mention, if you are listening on the radio today, if you have missed any of these visual images that we have shown here, which are extraordinary, they are shocking, they are horrifying.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  You need to get these. Go to band.video. You can go to theinfoward.tv. Of course, I'm going to be publishing more photos on my website later this week, naturalnews.com.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  But look all across the alternative media video sites as well. You know, I've got Brighton, there's Bitshoot, there's Rumble, there's Odyssey, there's all of these sites.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  This is going to be shared widely, and there's a lot more coming. And I'm hoping, by the way, that Alex might ask me back to do some other microscopy of food items in the future.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  Yeah, we could have something like Mike's Microscopy Monday or something, you know, from time to time, and kind of see what's in things.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  But stay with us. We'll be right back with another guest straight ahead here on The Alex Jones Show, just in a couple of minutes.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  I'm Mike Adams. Thank you for watching. We continue shortly.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  So now, the fight's out in the open. They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule. We're going to win this thing.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  God's watching the children counting on us. I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support, because without you, info wars would not be here.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  So I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war, and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the truth. We have the smoking gun evidence. We know what happened during the 2020 election, how the deep state-controlled Democrats stole the election.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  All the proof, absolutely cut and dry. There's no denying it. It's the film 2000 Mules by Dinesh De Souza, and we have the DVD with the expanded extras available right now at infowarstore.com.
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:34.000]  You can also get the DVD with massive discounts when you get it with other films like in-game blueprint for global enslavement and the new COVID land, the shot part three that just came out.
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the film every American must have. This is the most important documentary ever made in U.S. history because it proves that a major presidential election was stolen and it shows how they did it and how they're planning to do it again.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  Get 2000 Mules now at infowarstore.com and show it to every one you can so they don't steal the next election.
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  The globalists are making their move. Their great reset is here. They're coming for your children. They're coming for the value of your currency. They're coming for your national sovereignty.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  They're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny. They're coming for your free speech. They're coming for your privacy.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, they're coming for your right to vote and have your representative in government that you and your fellow Americans choose.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  The new film, the seminal film, the most important documentary ever made in my view, 2000 Mules is now available on DVD with expanded extras at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  You can also get the powerful film with other documentaries discounted at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  Everyone needs this DVD in their library to show everyone you know. We have the tools to bring these criminals to justice.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  They're planning to run the same scams again. This film can stop them if you take action. Infowarstore.com, 2000 Mules.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  You know, it's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when the internet and mobile technology first came out, which is we thought, you know, this is going to level the playing field.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  Everybody's going to have access to the same information and everybody's going to be able to freely communicate that information.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  That's our goal, to get back to that place where we all have access to all of the information. We all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever we want,
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations we're having,
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  because of the internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions, the people we want to talk to about these things.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  So that's our goal, is to help people take back their freedom by helping them to take back their privacy.
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  And so that's really what we're trying to do, and so I hope that everybody listening will check us out at boltowireless.com.
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  That's boltowireless.com.
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  Who has been seeing these outrageous clots and he, in fact, provided these clots to me, the clots that we have brought here today to the studio and we showed you in the previous hour.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  If you missed that, you've got to go back and see those live microscopy photos of these clots because these are not blood clots, folks.
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  These are not blood clots, so you keep hearing the term blood clots and that people are dying from blood clots or that people are having symptoms from blood clots.
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  These are not normal blood clots, these are tissues, some kind of structure that is growing or is being built inside the vessels, the blood vessels and the arteries,
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  and this is not normal, this has never happened before that we know of, and here to give us more details about his observations is Richard Hirschman,
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  who first noticed these and he's been working with Dr. Jane Ruby, who also joins us in the next segment, to try to, you know, expose what's happening.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  So, Mr. Hirschman, thank you so much for joining us today. You are live on the broadcast now. How's your Monday so far?
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  Seems crazy. Mike, it really does.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  Yeah, it is crazy. Well, thanks to you sending me these clot samples, all kinds of people are kind of freaking out about what's going on.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  So, show us, I understand you have some other vials there as well, show us what you have collected and then walk us through how are you collecting these samples,
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  because a lot of people are very skeptical about where these have come from, so please tell us the procedure how you're getting these clot samples.
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  Sure, when we embalm, we typically push fluid into an artery. This is an example of one of the five that I've got.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  And we force chemicals from how to hide into the body and then we allow the blood to drain out through a drain tube.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  And most of the time, a lot of times they just come out of the body without having to be pulled.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  But sometimes they start blocking the vessels and we have to put in some forceps in order to pull these out,
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  in order to allow the blood to continue to flow out of the body so that we can replace it.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  So, let me be clear, you're pushing embalming fluid into the vascular system and then in many cases, as you said, these clot structures are just coming out on their own through the drain tube.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  Yes, and when it gets clogged up, because some of these get really large, then we have to go in and try to manually pull them or help them out so that way the blood continues to flow and the preservative can be added to the body.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  Now, I want to, by the way, I've got a lot of questions for you, but I want to thank you for your courage. You are a true, oh my goodness.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  It's not just a hit and miss now, I see it all the time.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  Well, the fact that you're doing this and that you sent me samples and that you're willing to go public and use your name and talk about this is quite noteworthy in this age of medical repression and scientific authoritarianism.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  No one's allowed to talk about these things, but let me ask you then, in your experience as an embalmer, first of all, for how many years have you been engaged in this practice?
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  Yes, well, I remember during my apprenticeship, I remember being in the funeral home when 9-11 happened, so at least 20 years.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  And then how many embalming procedures would you say, just an estimate, that you have carried out over those roughly two decades?
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  That's a lot. In the beginning, when I worked for just one funeral home, we typically handled about somewhere between 100 to 150 bodies a year.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  Then I went in 2005 and worked for a corporation at a centralized embalming facility where there were three of us and we embalmed nearly a thousand bodies a year.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  Now I'm a trade embalmer since 2015 and I embalmed probably over 400 bodies a year now.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  So it's fair to say you've done thousands of these procedures over your career, easily?
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  Absolutely.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  Now, before the vaccines came out, these mRNA vaccines, before that time, had you ever seen these kinds of clot structures that we are now finding very frequently?
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  No. I did notice an increase in blood clotting during the peak of the COVID stuff.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  However, after the vaccine rolled out, and I'm estimating and guessing on exactly when I started to kind of put my finger on, hey, something's different, that would have been around May or June of last year, 2021.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  The first image I ever took was in late September and it was because people weren't understanding what I'm talking about when I talk about blood clots. They're very abnormal. That white fibrous material is strange to me.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  It almost looks like a vessel itself.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  See, that's the question that a skeptic would look at what you and I are doing here under the microscope and they would say, oh, you're playing with blood vessels. But these are not blood vessels.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  These are coming out of blood vessels. There's the shocker. And by the way, I showed this on camera in the last hour, but if you use tools and you pull these apart, they are very, very strong.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  Kind of like rubber bandery, you know, if you could say in terms of their properties, they don't just fall apart. They're not fragile. They have tensile strength.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  They do. They do. Sometimes they stretch pretty good. Now, of course, if they're the smaller ones and they're really thin, they do break, but often you can take them and stretch them just like you could a rubber band.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  Now, this one clot, there's a photo that we have been showing here today is very, very large clot that you told me came out of a carotid artery.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  And this clot is the size of a finger in terms of its diameter. And yeah, they're showing it right now. It's horrifying to people.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  I mean, one question is, how could someone even live with something like this in their carotid artery? Or maybe that's why they died. What are your thoughts?
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  Exactly. See, what you see there is just the that's the one. Okay, so when I was embalming this individual, I was told he was fine when he went to bed. Yes, it was an older gentleman, but he seemed to be fine and then just never woke up.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  His body was so full of clots that I had to go into each leg, each arm, and and raised the vessel in the neck as well. And I was like, you know, decided to try to push fluid from the from the groin area, pushing it up.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  And I opened the carotid artery to see if I could get fluid coming out because something's blocking this. And when I did that, I know as soon as I opened the artery, I could see there was a clot in there. So I tried to pull it out.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  Well, then, you know, some of it broke off. And as I'm pushing the fluid up and there's no fluid coming out, or use my forces to kind of help open it up Richard Richard stay with us.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  I'm sorry to interrupt. We're going to break here. It's shocking what you're describing and it explains why many people are dying suddenly. But we'll be right back after this break here on the Alice Jones show with Richard Hirschman, the embalmer.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  Stay with us.
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  Americans and others can get ready, be self sufficient and fund the info war while saving massive amounts of money on critical items they need. And of course, getting things delivered to them quickly, because in stock, preparetoday.com.

[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  I want to take a minute out to address the viewers and listeners of M4 Wars and to remind you that we've been vindicated and that world government and its tyrannical aim of depopulation is now out of the open.
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  Everything you and I have done together has been historic and we cannot continue in this fight without your support.
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  I want to encourage you all to be part of history right now while you still can to get the third and final coin in the founding member coin series to come and take it free men bear arms coins at 1776coin.com.
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  In just a few days, this coin will be gone forever and you will have the coin in your possession and know you helped info or stay on air at the most critical time in our 28-year history.
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  So I want to thank you all for your support and I want to encourage you all to be part of history and to get this historic memento that keeps us on air at infowarstore.com or 1776coin.com while you still can.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  And the social engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true.
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless. They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong.
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  And they know in the end they signed on the God of this world who is a loser. And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars on the air now more than ever.
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:33:09.000]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  And the heart of the resistance. It's Mike Adams. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  All right, continuing with this bombshell broadcast today on the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  And we are calling for a worldwide halt to all of these mRNA covid vaccines pending further investigation into these clots. These bio structure clots that we have shown conclusively under the microscope here live in studio in the last hour.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  These are not blood clots. These are structures that are growing inside people's bodies growing inside arteries inside blood vessels and then when they get large enough, they can lodge and cause heart attacks or strokes or thrombosis or they can simply cut off the blood supply to the brain and the patient dies.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  And we believe that this is what's causing so called sudden adult death syndrome SADS. And we are joined by embalmer Richard Hirschman here to continue this conversation.
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  I do want to mention that the fourth hour host today is Gerald Salenty of the trend journal is going to be commenting on the rather dynamic market conditions that are taking place today.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  And also Dr. Jane Ruby is coming up here in about 30 minutes. She'll be joining me for the entire third hour to help pull all of this together.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  I want to thank Dr. Ruby also for connecting us Hirschman and myself and facilitating the acquisition of these clots that you have seen here today.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  Without Dr. Ruby, none of this would be happening. And without Hirschman, this would not be happening either.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  So Richard Hirschman, again, thank you for continuing with us. Now, you talked about chalky substances in the blood in a private conversation that we had a couple of days ago.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  I'd like to ask you about these chalky substances because what we're seeing on the microscope here in the studio are strange white specs or white substances that resist normal staining techniques.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  They resist iodine staining, for example, and they show up as white flecks or specs on these clots that may be a clue. What are you seeing with the chalky substances?
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  Yes, sometimes when I am doing the embalming, this is why something is strange. Something has been different with the blood.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  The blood is not the same. And when I talk about the chalky substance, when I embalm, sometimes it looks almost as if there's like this chalky substance flowing in it.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  And sometimes I refer to it as looking almost like, you know, fine coffee grounds coming out in the blood as I'm embalming.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  You know, which isn't normal. You know, I'm not used to seeing blood look like that. And I've seen it several times now.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  Is visible to the naked eye? I mean, you're seeing these particles and you're describing them as coffee grounds. Is that roughly the particle size of a coffee ground?
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  Yes, sometimes they're larger, like a grain of coffee, and sometimes it's really fine, almost like if you were maybe using a powdered coffee and a little residue that you might see at the bottom of your cup.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  So what we're showing while you're talking is we're showing some of the microscopy photos that show these white particles or substances which resemble either perhaps microplastics or perhaps some kind of crystalline structures.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  But what we are looking at is at a much smaller scale than what would be visible to the naked eye. So what you are seeing is probably a thousand times larger than what we're showing on the screen.
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  I mean, if you're seeing these particles with the naked eye, you know, something is very, very wrong. This is not normal.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  Right. And one of the doctors that I spoke with, his name was Dr. Thorpe up in Michigan. And when I showed him the images of some of the pictures that I have, he basically was saying, you know, that's kind of scary.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  But what's concerning to him are what he called microclots. And when I hear the term microclots, I'm still I'm thinking of something you can't see with the naked eye.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  But I can see this stuff. And I'm curious, you know, and, you know, and I can work with you or whoever wants to be worked with when I have another case that I see this chalky granular substance, maybe collect a sample of that and chip it and see
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  if you put it on their microscope and zoom in, is it basically the same structure at a much smaller scale?
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  Well, that's an absolute yes. So if you see that, go ahead and collect that sample, ship it to me, we'll sterilize it with proper laboratory handling procedures.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  And then we can bring it into the studio here and we can take a look at that probably do the same thing we're doing today live on air.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  But and I want to I want to say too, by the way, just just to honor the dead here, we are, you know, these people died, we believe from these clots.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  And I believe that if they could speak, they would want us to tell the world and sound the alarm.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  And I don't want anybody out there to think that we are in any way, you know, exploiting the tissues of these dead people for any kind of sensationalism.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  What's sensational or horrifying is the fact that these are being found.
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  And I believe in my heart that the dead would want us to sound the alarm.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  Do you agree with that assessment or sort of what is your philosophical approach to what you and I are doing right now publicly with the tissues from the dead?
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  Yes, that is one of the reasons why I am coming out. I felt like I was being led that I have to say something.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  But I didn't know exactly how or where to say it.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  But I was sitting or seeing all of these clots and, you know, in the beginning when COVID was still around, that was a great excuse.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  So, you know, maybe this was related, maybe it was related to the virus itself.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  However, when COVID is going away and yet these clots are getting worse, it's like, okay, so now what's happening?
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  And I feel like something's contributing.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  All these people that are dying are not being listed as COVID anymore.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  And they're being listed as normal, you know, heart attack stroke or whatever.
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  And I'm seeing all these strange clots and I feel like somebody's got to say something.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  Because my fear is this, we can prove, if we can prove, and I'm pretty sure it's coming, you know, we can prove this is due to the vaccine itself.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  Then we need to stop because it's possible that all of these people died prematurely because of these strange virus tissues that are in their blood.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  You're exactly right, Richard.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  In fact, you know, adults have a choice of whether or not to take this vaccine in most cases.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  I understand there's a lot of coercion, a lot of threats and so on.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  But children are now being targeted by these vaccines as young as five years old or even younger, the new emergency use authorization targeting children and so on.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  These children do not have a choice.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  They do not have informed consent.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  And if these bio structures are growing after injection, then these children that are being injected today, two years down the road or a year or three years, we don't exactly know the timeline.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  They may die from sudden child death syndrome, you know, which is really just these clots.
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  I mean, this is a medical slaughter of a generation, it seems.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  And it could go generation all.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  Tell me about other embalmers that you must know in the industry.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  Are they confirming what you are seeing?
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  Yes, I've asked several people that have more years of experience than I do.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  They're all seeing it.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  When I show some of the ones that have like 40, 50 years of experience, sometimes they're in the embalmering with me and I'm like, have you ever seen this stuff?
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  And it's always been, no, they've never seen it.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  I've got a, I follow a Facebook page, it's a private thing that has other embalmers across the country.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  And most of them also are seeing the same situation in their area.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  So why, I mean, we only have a few seconds left here, but why are they not willing to speak out like you are in your opinion?
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  I'm a trade person.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  I work for myself.
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  I work for several funeral homes.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  Most of the embalmers work for a funeral home.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  If a person brings too much attention to the funeral home, they could get blowback and maybe fired for just bringing too much negative attention.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  And nobody wants to be the first one on the dance floor.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  People are afraid to speak.
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  There's people afraid to lose in their jobs.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  That's why I think there's so much silence.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  All right, we're about to go to break.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  We're going to be continuing to hear one more segment with Richard Hirschman here on the Alex Jones show.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  You're watching infowars.com, theinfowar.tv is the website to give out.
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  Ask everybody to join in much more straight ahead.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:29.000]  The most important documentary ever made in my view.
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  2,000 mules is now available on DVD with expanded extras at infowarsstore.com.
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  You can also get the powerful film with other documentaries discounted at infowarsstore.com.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  Everyone needs this DVD in their library to show everyone you know.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  We have the tools to bring these criminals to justice.
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  They're planning to run the same scams again.
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  This film can stop them if you take action.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:57.000]  infowarsstore.com, 2,000 mules.
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  Both the regular shows and special reports.

[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  That look in to say the Anglo-American establishment.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  The founder of the Bilderberg group, the Trilateral Commission of the United Nations.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  The whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  Until 10 years ago the media said the control corporate media of the Bilderberg group didn't exist.
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  Well now the Bilderberg group is public in its former head.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  Still on the steering committee.
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  It's called Schwab.
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  And he has set up the great reset in global government.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  And if as a liberty movement worldwide we don't address the globalist head on.
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  About the fact that they are worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover.
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  We don't have a shot.
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  If you expose them we can beat them easily.
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported infowars financially with word of mouth and prayer.
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:05.000]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists.
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  The fact that we're not caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  I just want to thank you all for buying products and infowars.com like books and films and supplements and water filtration and air filtration so much more.

[1:46:54.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  Thank you so much for your support. Please take action.
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  I'm calling bio structures that we were showing here earlier with the microscope now in studio and there's a lot more that coming folks.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  This has really only been kind of a teaser of what you are about to see.
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  We are trying to wake up the world's medical communities to the truth about what's happening after vaccination.
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  Apparently people's bodies are being programmed to grow, to build, to engineer bio structures inside their arteries and blood vessels.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  And for a while as these grow they begin to take up more and more space inside the arteries but blood flows around them at first.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  And so people may not have any symptoms or anything noticeable but over time they become so large that they can kill people.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  And that's why these large tissue like clots that are very fibrous, that are very durable, they are kind of like a rubber band in terms of their properties.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  That's why these are being found in people's bodies and again our embalmer here Richard Hirschman is joining us to give us more details about this.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  We're going to be joined by Dr. Jane Ruby in the beginning of the next hour.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  She'll be joining us for her thoughts on all this.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  Richard Hirschman, back to you.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  The trends that you're observing in this right now, are you expecting to see more and more of these clots now in the dead that are presented to you that you're required to work on?
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  I believe so.
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  Like last year in November people kept asking me how many of these am I seeing and I wasn't really keeping track so I started taking notes on my computer of people with strange clots.
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  And back then it was pretty close to 50% and probably in February it was probably around 60 something percent.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  And it seems like right now I'm pushing 70, maybe even 80% of the bodies that I do.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  Sometimes the clots aren't always the same.
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  Now if I see a body that's not clotted at all or doesn't have anything that looks suspicious to me on my computer, I leave it blank.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  But if it has even small clots that I find to be strange, I highlight that like in yellow and the clots that are a little bit more fibrous
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  like the ones that I showed, kind of like this kind of stuff right here, then I'll highlight that in orange.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  And if I find out that they're vaccinated like this one was, then I'll highlight that in green.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  So I am trying to keep track and it seems like the numbers are getting more and more of the bodies that I have have this strange stuff in it.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  It also seems like some of the age groups are starting to get a little bit on the younger side.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  Most of them that I've had are older people.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  Shocking information there.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  If this is approaching 70 to 80% of the embalming subjects that you work on, that is consistent, I would think,
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  with a lot of the increased death rates that are being observed by insurance companies and also in government statistics around the world.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  But I want to ask you a very technical question here.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  First of all, what is the largest diameter clot tissue that you have collected that you actually have in your possession right now?
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  If you were to estimate, I don't know, in millimeters or something, what's the largest diameter that you have?
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  You know, I don't really know.
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  The largest one that I collected was that large one that came out of that carotid artery, but it's no longer in my possession.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  And that would have been probably almost as thick as my pinky finger.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  Right, right, but you have a lot that I've seen.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  What would you see coming off of that, those branches?
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  Yes.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  That's typically what I'm seeing.
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  All right, so then I'm just going to estimate that what you're showing us in your vials, they look like maybe five millimeters up to five millimeters in diameter,
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  something maybe four millimeters, something in that range.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  Yeah.
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  Let me find out an example of something that is smaller that I have here.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  Diameter of a pencil eraser, let's say, to use a common object.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  No, no, not quite that.
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  Okay.
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  Like here's a small sample and I don't know if you can see those.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  That looks pretty small.
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  Yeah, those are smaller ones, but again, you know, then they get bigger.
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  I see.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  And then they get to be a whole bunch of them, you know.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  Right.
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  Okay, now here's my next question.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  What we need to do is we need to see these tissues are self-sustaining, which means they appear to be composed of living cells.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  We, I mean, they're not dead cells floating around the body is not what it appears because they, they, they have branches.
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  They are obviously growing or assembling over time.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  We need to cut into some of these and see if there's anything going on inside these.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  I mean, I don't know any other way to put it, but we need a large sample that we can kind of dissect.
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  Yes.
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  Well, we also need to run genetic tests on these tissues and find out, do they share the same genes as the person?
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  Or is there some other kind of genetic code at work here?
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  I mean, that would be a key test.
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  Unfortunately, I can't run that test, but that's what we need done.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  That's, you know, there's, there's more questions that come out the longer we do this.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  Now I've had, I had a medical examiner try to tell me these are postmortem clots.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  But there's, I mean, I've dealt with clots for 20 years and all these clots that I see are different.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  And of course I had to respectfully disagree, but I mean, I'm not the doctor.
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  I just know what I see and what I'm used to.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  Well, I also, I know what blood cells look like under a microscope and I know what congealed blood cells look like.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  These are not blood cells.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  These are fibrous structures.
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  These have repeating segments, I mean, even sort of scale-like or skin-like segments that are repeating on the outside structures of some of these strands.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  I mean, that's clearly these are not blood cells.
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  That's immediately obvious to any trained physician or biologists or anybody.
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  So there's something else, then there's something that appears to be living cells, which means, I mean, if that's confirmed,
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  it means that people are walking around with tissues living inside them.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  And the question is, are they their own tissues, somehow, that the programming has gone wrong, like a cancer tumor, you know?
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  Or are they something completely different?
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  I mean, that's the mystery.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  I talked to a lady who works at a veterinary clinic and she saw some of the samples, one of the first samples that I had, it was in a cup.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  And she said it looked like heartworms.
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  But, you know, I've never seen any of these things move, so I have no idea.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  No, and if they were heartworms, they would, we would have seen that under the microscope.
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  We would have seen the parasitic structures, because, you know, even heartworms have, you know, organelles and organ systems and so on.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  And, you know, certain segmentation.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  Thank you for clarifying that one for me, because I have no idea.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  No, these are clearly not heartworms.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  These are not parasites, and they are some, yeah, there's a photo of heartworms.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  These don't look like that under the microscope at all.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  I have a whole set of slides where I've studied parasites and insects and organelles and things like that under the microscope, so that I know kind of what common things look like in different bacteria slides and single cell microorganisms and so on.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  So, I do have some knowledge in that area. These are not heartworms, I can tell you that.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  Well, I was asked earlier today, somebody that would like to speak with you, and he was asking if I could, you know, did I send samples of normal blood clots and to compare them against normal blood clots, but I don't have anything like that.
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  It seems like the clots have all changed, and I don't know what normal is anymore with the strange stuff that I'm seeing.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  Well, you know, we took a blood sample here today, I mean, just a drop of blood from one of the crew members to show how it would clot on the slide.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  So, you know, we anticipated that question, and we showed very clearly what a normal healthy drop of blood when it starts to clot, what it looks like, and it does not have strands and fibers and structures and repeating elements like what we're seeing in these clots.
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  So, you know, we've already clearly shown that. I mean, a normal blood clot is, yes?
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  I thank you very much for doing that, because people want to try to say that these are normal, and I've been in this business for 20 years. I know what normal blood clots look like.
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  Yeah, this is not normal. This is why I say, yeah.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  Richard Hirschman, I want to thank you for joining us today, and it's been a great honor to be able to speak with you about this. Keep us informed and keep the samples coming.
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  And just thank you for joining us today. God bless you.
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  God bless you. Thank you, Mike.

[2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:21.000]  Coming up in about five minutes, we're going to be joined by Dr. Jane Ruby, kind of tied together the astonishing bombshell information that we've shared with you here today on this Infowars broadcast, Monday, June 13, 2022.
[2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:29.000]  I'm Mike Adams. I want to kind of summarize what we've learned here today in the next few minutes, and then we'll be joined by Dr. Jane Ruby on the other side.
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  Gerald Salenti is coming up as the fourth hour host after all this. But I want to summarize what we've shown you here today exclusively on Infowars.com is that these clots that are coming out of the bodies of people who have passed, who have suddenly in the post-vaccine era, these clots are not blood clots.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  They are tissues. They are complex tissue structures. I'm calling them bioengineered structures. They have never appeared in the body as far as we can tell until the vaccines came along.
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  They now, as Richard Hirschman just told us, they now represent 70 to 80% of the subjects of embalming. So you could estimate maybe 70 to 80% of the deaths occurring today as a rough estimate, maybe occurring among those who have these clots.
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  And you could project with some, you know, estimates and say, this is going to be devastating unless there is a way found to halt and reverse these clots, which are not blood clots.
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  Again, they are tissues that apparently are being grown or engineered or constructed inside the blood vessels and inside the arteries of people.
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  We may be looking at a mass die-off from these clots in the next, well, I mean, it has already begun, and it may continue for years to come.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  And now they're targeting children with these vaccines. What's going to happen to these children in the next year or two if this same phenomenon begins to be observed in the vascular systems of these children?
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  We heard from a physician who is seeing what he called an explosion of these clots in patients presenting to urgent care.
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  And we've also shown you microscopy photos of what these clots are, and they clearly are fibrous structures that have rather strong, linear strength or tensile strength.
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  They appear to be like small rubber bands. We've shown you photos of these clots at different sizes in the body, which indicates that they may start small and then they grow over time.
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  They expand. They build more cells. They are constructed in the body.
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  And to be constructed in the body, there must be instructions for that construction, which means there must be genetic code for the protein synthesis.
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  These are proteins that are creating these clots, these fibers. Where is this code coming from?
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  You probably already know the answer to that, where this code is coming from.
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  We can only ask questions right now and demand further investigations. We know that these clots do not respond to traditional anti-clotting interventions.
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  Heparin does nothing. Coomidin does nothing. These clots can't be treated by modern medicine in any way that is currently known.
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  We know that patients are having such extreme clots that they have to undergo, for example, femoral artery bypass surgery, or they're finding massive clots in the carotid arteries.
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  Well, I want to add something to this analysis.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  If the carotid arteries are being partially blocked, that would explain declining cognition among those who have been vaccinated if indeed these vaccines are contributing to these clots or these clot structures.
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  You see, if you start to lose blood flow to your brain, your cognition begins to slowly decline.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  You may not even be aware of it, but you might begin to exhibit symptoms of Alzheimer's or dementia.
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  You might begin to behave kind of like the way in which we see Joe Biden, who appears to be not in possession of his full mental faculties, shall we say.
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  What if this is happening across the population? Could this explain the decline in reason and rationality that is contributing to the downfall of Western civilization?
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  Could it be destruction by injection and clots that block brain function to take away our humanity and our reason?
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:57.000]  We'll be back with Dr. Jane Ruby to ask those questions and much more. Stay with us here on the Alex Jones show.
[2:04:57.000 --> 2:05:09.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, high quality, storeable food is back in stock, ready to ship right now. We've not been selling food for three months because it was taking several weeks for the food to get packaged and delivered to you.
[2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:15.000]  Most other companies are completely out, but now they have a large spectrum of high quality food ready to ship.
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  Everything you find at PrepareWithAlex.com or PrepareToDay.com is in stock ready to ship, so go to PrepareWithAlex.com or PrepareToDay.com and order your high quality, storeable food right now, ready to ship to you and your family.
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  With the inflation happening, with the food shortages, with the wars, with the collapsing wars, everything's happening.
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:50.000]  One of the most important things you can make is to have high quality, storeable food, water filtration, air filtration and more, and it's not just those items. It's hundreds of other high quality, preparedness items and survival items right now at PrepareWithAlex.com that again redirects to PrepareToday.com.
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:06:05.000]  I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen. One of the most important things you can do is get ahead of inflation now because the inflation is just beginning.
[2:06:05.000 --> 2:06:15.000]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[2:06:15.000 --> 2:06:23.000]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Mike Adams and this is Monday, June 13th, 2022. This is our number three.
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  We're going to be joined shortly by Dr. Jane Ruby, who deserves tremendous credit for helping to make today's show happen, by the way.
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:47.000]  It's Dr. Ruby who has been pursuing this kind of investigation into these clots that we're now able to bring to you and she has run into a lot of resistance, by the way, in trying to get this kind of analysis to take place.
[2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  And I have to say that Dr. Ruby deserves tremendous credit and that she and Richard Hirschman put their faith in myself to be able to take these samples and do the analysis that you're seeing today.
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  And I will promise you there is more to come. This is just the beginning.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  So I want to bring in Dr. Jane Ruby and just say, Dr. Ruby, thank you for having the courage and the foresight to make this happen.
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:23.000]  You are truly a hero for humanity and with your effort, we are beginning to be able to spread the alarm about these clots and the dangers that these appear to pose to humanity as a whole.
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  Welcome to the show today.
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  Thank you so much, Mike. The real heroes really seriously are you and Mr. Hirschman for him for coming forward with such bravery because I've spoken to possibly 50 or 60 other embalmers who showed me the same things and they don't want to come forward at all.
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:49.000]  They're too frightened. So he's a hero. And thank you so much for taking this baton.
[2:07:49.000 --> 2:07:59.000]  We've tried since January to get somebody to look at it. And to be honest with you, we've been sabotaged. We've been gaslighted and we've been stalled.
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  And I should have thought of you from the beginning because you have the integrity and the honesty and the reputation and you certainly have the skills with your certified labs.
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  So I'm just happy to send this on to you.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  Well, again, this really is a team effort. All of us here in the independent media. I mean, think about this. The mainstream media won't touch this.
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  Mainstream science won't touch this. Anybody who would do what we are doing here today would have their funding cut off by Fauci and the NIH and so on, or they would, all their federal grants would be cut and so on.
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  I mean, this is really a critical moment for humanity and demonstrating the integrity and the real science that we are conducting in the independent media that is showing the danger to the world of what is happening right now.
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  So I just have to say thank you, but let's jump right into it, Dr. Ruby.
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  The resistance that you found, I still can't believe it, that no one was willing to do this. But have you been able to see some of these images now from the microscope I published on last night on my website and here today?
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  What are your initial reactions to some of these microscopy images?
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  Well, you might find this surprising, but I'm not shocked by it. Because remember, I've been working with all kinds of experts for the last 18 months because we're feeling our way through the dark, essentially.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  And these people all have a different angle on this, patents, protocols, other kinds of reports, blood reports, and then putting the pieces together over the months.
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  I'm not surprised, and I'll take you one step further backward.
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  In September of 2019, when President Trump signed the Modernization Act for newer technologies, there was an obligation from the NIH to go before Congress.
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  And so Fauci appeared on December 4th, 2019. It's a transcript record 14 pages before the House Energy Committee and the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight.
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  And he specifically said, Mike, we're going to be using self-assembling nanoparticles. No one said a word, no one called him out, no one asked him to explain what that was, and they just let it go on.
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  And what you're looking at from your brilliant work, it looks like to me, is the results of self-assembling nanomachinery inside blood vessels.
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  They could be developing in other types of vessels, remember lymphatic vessels, other types of chambers in the body.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  It's just that we haven't seen them readily as you would from an embalmer. So that's really my first response to everything that you presented on the show today.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  The key word that you just used there is absolutely, I should have used it earlier, self-assembling.
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  What's clear is that these clot structures, they are not, let's say, attached to the vascular walls. They don't have an umbilical cord, for example.
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  They are clearly self-assembling based on whatever they're able to capture from the blood, but they also have instructions.
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  You know, because, well, you have to have protein synthesis instructions in order to self-assemble these structures inside the body.
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  So we know these are not normal blood clots. They're not just blood. They are flesh-like protein structures.
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:28.000]  They are self-assembling like you just said. Thank you for that. And they are growing inside the body.
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:37.000]  This should be alarm bells ringing worldwide. This should be a global call to stop all the vaccines right now, should it not?
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:43.000]  Absolutely. And I have to tell you something else. Kind of a breaking piece of information.
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  I don't know if Mr. Hirschman, you know, mentioned it or in any of your discussions with him, but he has actually gone back to a vial a couple of days later,
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  just a couple of days in formula, in a refrigerator or freezer, and these things were larger on their own.
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  So they don't necessarily need the inside of a human body, but inside a human body.
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  And remember, Mike, we know from the leaked communications between Pfizer and the EMA from last year, they're now in the public domain,
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  that Pfizer negotiated for themselves, and I'm sure the other companies did too, that 50% of those vials didn't have to be declared,
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  which gave them the leeway to change it. I've always said it really looks, and I credit the work of Team Enigma that looked at the lot numbers
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  and found huge discrepancies within the same lot number, and they said this could not be a statistical anomaly.
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  This is due to the fact that there are different materials in there at any given time.
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  So God only knows what we're dealing with. We have tomorrow, the 14th of June, and Wednesday, the 15th of June,
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  they're coming for our babies, our six-month-old babies and toddlers, and I just want to get the word out to parents who may be on the fence
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:03.000]  for some strange reason. You've got to rethink this. You've got to rethink this.
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  Well, wow. You're exactly right. They're coming for the children on this.
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  But I've got to say, for the record, what you described, some of these structures continuing to grow even outside the body.
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  I am very skeptical of such a description. I do not believe that unless I see it, frankly, because that would be so wild.
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  That would be just so unexpected. I mean, my theory is that these need the blood supply flowing around these structures
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  in order to continue to maintain viability and to expand. I'm not saying that he's wrong.
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  I'm just saying I would need a lot of evidence to believe such a thing.
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  But you make a really important point. They're going after the children.
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  What if now, through all these injections of children who have no choice in this matter, this is almost like post-birth abortion?
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  I mean, it's a kind of slow medical slaughtering of children if they died two years down the road from blood clots
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  that were caused by these injections. Isn't that true?
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  Yeah, and you know, Mike, you raised an interesting issue. We don't know how much these people suffered before they dropped dead.
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  Because this didn't develop overnight, right?
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  So it had to have taken some time because of these are large structures to the point where it overwhelms the body
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  and then the person keels over. But we don't know from the time they got shot up to the time they dropped dead
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  what they lived with. They were either afraid to say it, didn't understand it, cognitive dissonance.
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  Doctors that they went to told them they were imagining it. So people are suffering in between.
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  And I'm just so worried about the babies and the children. But yeah, yeah, there's a lot.
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  And who knows? Maybe it doesn't need a human body if it's taking materials that also occur in the nonbiologic sense, right?
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  That's possible.
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  What we need to do and what I'm asking Richard Hirschman to do is find the largest diameter clot that he can
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  to get it to me. And what we need to do is dissect that clot structure under the microscope
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  and find out if there is any kind of internal structure to this. I mean, for example, does it have angiogenesis?
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  Is it building its own internal blood distribution vascular system like a cancer tumor does?
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  I mean, I don't know. I'm not claiming it does. But we need to look at this closely and dissect it.
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  I mean, what if this is some other viable organism being developed? I mean, we don't know, but what if?
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  Yeah, one of the most stunning findings that you presented was the nanowire. And I know that you don't know 100% if that is, but it doesn't.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  We've got to go to break, Dr. Ruby. I apologize for interrupting you. We'll be right back to answer that question about the nanowires and biocircuitry.
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:55.000]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show. I'm Mike Adams. We'll be right back after this break.
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:16:04.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the truth. We have the smoking gun evidence. We know what happened during the 2020 election.
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  How the deep state-controlled Democrats stole the election. All the proof, absolutely cut and dry. There's no denying it.
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:22.000]  It's the film 2000 Mules by Dinesh Desuza. And we have the DVD with the expanded extras available right now at infowarstore.com.
[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  You can also get the DVD with massive discounts when you get it with other films like in-game blueprint for global enslavement and the new COVID land, The Shot, Part 3, that just came out.
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the film every American must have. This is the most important documentary ever made in U.S. history because it proves that a major presidential election was stolen and it shows how they did it and how they're planning to do it again.
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  Get 2000 Mules now at infowarstore.com and show it to everyone you can so they don't steal the next election.
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  If you're in a nightmare or you're in a horror, you get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused. You have a concussion.
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:36.000]  And that's what the globalists have done. They have stunned us. They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings.
[2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:47.000]  And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave a speech called The Great New Narrative where he brags how the public is lost, how the culture and the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  and guide humanity over the edge of a cliff. That's what the great reason is. They need darkness to thrive.

[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:31.000]  Understanding this and knowing this. So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do things tax wise.
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:39.000]  It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.

[2:19:57.000 --> 2:20:13.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:13.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  We are unveiling today a worldwide emergency, a medical emergency that could be affecting literally billions of human beings who may be walking around right now with these engineered bio structures growing inside their vascular systems.
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:43.000]  It's hyperbole. It's not exaggeration. This is what we are seeing. This is what the evidence is showing us. We have physical possession of these clot samples. They are not blood clots. They are complex structures.
[2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  They are being built. They contain repeating patterns. The body is clearly receiving instructions to build these structures. We don't yet know what they are or what their purpose is.
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:21:13.000]  Dr. Ruby joins us now. She is on Telegram. Dr. Ruby, I want to ask you for your theories of what could explain this, specifically a question that was actually posed by a crew member here.
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  Could these clots be explained by just the presence of spike protein? Could a bunch of spike proteins come together and make these things? Is that possible? What's your theory?
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  That's a really good question. I had a discussion with the famous virologist, Dr. Sukrit Bhakti in Germany. He pointed out something really important that the mRNA technology is designed supposedly to force your body to make billions of those spike proteins.
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  We know the lipid nanoparticle gets into every cell in the body. When it gets into every cell, especially the lining of your blood vessels, it starts to produce these things all over your body. These spikes eventually, when you are making them by the billions, they stick out.
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:13.000]  When you stick out in the lumen of a blood vessel, you're interrupting the velocity or the speed of the flow. There's a natural pressure sensors to that. The body detects that something's in there and it sends clotting and fibrinogen and things like that.
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:29.000]  For that reason, it's a good question, but I think that you would see blood clots from real blood form and probably take the person out with throwing one into their brain or their lung or their heart.
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  The embalmers would not find the extent of this material throughout the vasculature. That would be my roundabout answer to that. It's always a possibility.
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:23:08.000]  What is really interesting in my mind, I've had many discussions with Mr. Hirschman as you can imagine over the months. One of the startling things he has said consistently is that these white fibrous pieces, while they do have blood around them and sometimes on one end or the other, they're attached to a bloody clot,
[2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  he said when he kind of peels it back and this is really, really creepy, he said the white fibrous thing that we don't know exactly what it is yet seems to be feeding off of or emanating out of the blood.
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  So there could be that theory that it's using materials in it or maybe it's hanging on to it or stuck to it for some other reason.
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:43.000]  But look, the bottom line, Mike, and you said this a number of times, this is not for your health. This is not for the public health. This does not have anything to do with A virus, any virus.
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:57.000]  And the thing that got me really upset in the very beginning was the lockstep nature of this. How does this happen simultaneously in every country, every state in the United States, every industry, every corporation?
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  It didn't make sense to me. So I knew that there was something more than just a couple of rogue scientists.
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  The big question on this is if indeed that these mRNA instructions are somehow telling the body to build these structures,
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  is this an unintended consequence of mucking around and playing God with genetic code or is this something that they knew was going to happen that was engineered into the system?
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  Because if you look at the mRNA gene sequences, there are a lot of suspicious sequences in there that might have to do with fibrinogen, as you mentioned, or how the blood reacts.
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  I mean, maybe they just didn't test it. We know they didn't bother to test it. They fudged all the trials and emergency use authorization was just thrown out there.
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  It's safe and effective. Just take it. Isn't it possible this could even take them by surprise?
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:07.000]  You know, Mike, not a chance. And I'll tell you why. I spent 20 years in this industry on the medical research side.
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  You couldn't sneeze and the PR department would be down your throat. Everything had to come out of their department. Everything was damage control.
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  Everything was positive, right? You haven't heard a peep from any of these companies.
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  And furthermore, you haven't heard a peep from any of the other companies, the hundreds of hundreds and thousands of companies in this industry.
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  Doesn't that strike anyone is really strange? Because if this was unintended and an oops moment and oh my gosh, we were sloppy with, you know, you know, with the testing, they would have been out here apologizing, pulling it back themselves, recalculating it, resetting it.
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  But instead, they're pushing it and pushing it and they want you to take booster after booster because, Mike, I think that in order to get this to develop in the body, you have to keep taking it, right?
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  I believe you have to keep priming the system with this direction because the body is not a potted plant, right? You know, God is incredible.
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  This is a genius system and it's always going to try to save us. And so the point I'm trying to make is that the body degrades, I mean, everything.
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  That's why we give you, you're on a medication, you're on it every day because your liver breaks it down, your system breaks it down in many other ways.
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  It metabolizes it down and excretes it. So your body's probably doing something like that here.
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  You're thinking this is why they keep pushing more booster shots and also perhaps this might explain the motivation for why they want to inject young children, five and under, who are at essentially zero risk from COVID.
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  There's no medical justification for an immunization program targeting children in that age range against COVID. So clearly there's some other motivation at work here and maybe this is it.
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  You know, you hit them with these injections and you wait 18 months or whatever the duration is and children grow massive clots in their arteries and they're dead within five years.
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  I mean, that could be what we're looking at here.
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  Yeah, I think it's a multi pronged approach. I think it's immediate death for depopulation.
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:25.000]  I think it is also I've been looking at talking to Dr. Daniel Negasi, he's done his work on molecular biology and says this stuff is poisoning the human genome.
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  And through recombinant DNA activity, transcriptase, reverse transcriptase, you're going to see this continue through generations.
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:42.000]  If people survive long enough to procreate, they're not in the clear. And so there's there's that there's the damaging of the human DNA.
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  Remember the Moderna CMO, Tysax saying we're going to hack, you know, the the the software of life human beings are like the software of life.
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  So so I think it's I think it's depopulation death. It's changing the genome. And I also think that this nano wire that you've nailed in these pictures in your work.
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  I think that's going to lead to maybe a third part of their their program to to be able to send signals or retrieve signals.
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:23.000]  You have this this sick animal, you've all know Vary Harari saying, you know, we're going to, you know, put everybody through this, you know, central mental, you know, the net of all things.
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  This is how they're probably doing it. And their technology is Dr. Ruby, I'm going to glove up here during this break coming up.
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  And I'm going to go I'm going to I have that nano wire sample right here on the microscope.
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  Go over to that station in the next segment with you. And I'd like to have a conversation with you. You're getting video from us, correct?
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  You can see the broadcast video. OK, so we're going to go live on the microscope right after this break.
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones show info wars dot com live microscopy coming right up.

[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:19.000]  We've not sold food for three months, because there was a wait.
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  Now there is not a wait. Almost every other storeable food distributor is completely out and will not have more food for months if ever.
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  And the prices are exploding.
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to protect yourself and your family and not be dependent on the system.
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  The time to be self sufficient is now.
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:43.000]  We have the best deals on high quality, storeable food and a whole spectrum of other preparedness and survival items right now.

[2:29:56.000 --> 2:30:08.000]  I want to take a minute out to address the viewers and listeners of info wars and to remind you that we've been vindicated and that world government and its tyrannical aim of depopulation is now out of the open.
[2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:15.000]  Everything you and I have done together has been historic and we cannot continue in this fight without your support.
[2:30:15.000 --> 2:30:18.000]  I want to encourage you all to be part of history right now.
[2:30:18.000 --> 2:30:30.000]  But you still can't get the third and final point in the founding member coin series to come and take it free men bear arms coins at 1776 point dot com.
[2:30:30.000 --> 2:30:42.000]  In just a few days this coin will be gone forever and you will have the coin in your possession and know you helped info wars stay on air at the most critical time in our 28 year history.
[2:30:42.000 --> 2:30:55.000]  So I want to thank you all for your support and I want to encourage you all to be part of history and to get this historic momento that keeps us on air at info wars store dot com or 1776 point dot com while you still can.
[2:30:55.000 --> 2:31:03.000]  The globalists are making their move. Their great reset is here. They're coming for your children. They're coming for the value of your currency.
[2:31:03.000 --> 2:31:12.000]  They're coming for your national sovereignty. They're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny. They're coming for your free speech.
[2:31:12.000 --> 2:31:22.000]  They're coming for your privacy and ladies and gentlemen they're coming for your right to vote and have your representative in government that you and your fellow Americans choose.
[2:31:22.000 --> 2:31:35.000]  The new film the seminal film the most important documentary ever made in my view 2000 mules is now available on DVD with expanded extras at info wars store dot com.
[2:31:35.000 --> 2:31:41.000]  You can also get the powerful film with other documentaries discounted at info wars store dot com.
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:47.000]  Everyone needs this DVD in their library to show everyone you know we have the tools to bring these criminals to justice.
[2:31:47.000 --> 2:31:57.000]  They're planning to run the same scams again. This film can stop them if you take action info wars store dot com 2000 mules.
[2:31:57.000 --> 2:32:07.000]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training probably not as much as they should be but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for info wars store dot com.
[2:32:07.000 --> 2:32:17.000]  Before I start out on a run I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going you know besides the energy turbo force.
[2:32:17.000 --> 2:32:27.000]  It is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:40.000]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones sore less. I have bad joints. Thanks mom. So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[2:32:40.000 --> 2:32:52.000]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon. Good news turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day.
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:32:57.000]  And so let's keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[2:32:57.000 --> 2:33:07.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:07.000 --> 2:33:34.000]  All right folks we're back. I'm on the microscope and we're joined by Dr. Jane Ruby who's going to be helping us interpret what we're seeing here live in real time and we're going to be feeding this video microscope image of the so-called nano wire.
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:45.000]  And in fact to the producers you can just show that right now I want to show people this is a live real time image we're going to be able to zoom in and out and cruise around and take a closer look at this.
[2:33:45.000 --> 2:33:52.000]  So Dr. Ruby this is the nano wire structure at least that's what I'm calling it. We don't yet know what this is.
[2:33:52.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  But looking at this structure you can see the repeating patterns it looks like almost like a snake skin type structure. This is not normal. This should not be in your blood supply. What do you make of this Dr. Ruby.
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:12.000]  Well I'm certainly not an expert. Obviously none of us are in this this evil.
[2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  But I agree with you the repeating patterns. I look inside it looks like it's an insulated wire right or that something is insulated. And when you and Mr. Hirschman talked about the tensile strength of these materials these
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  thoughts that you've you've handled it makes perfect sense that this is an encasement right. And so those those I agree with you also on the description that it's scale like look at that almost looks like it's laying over.
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:54.000]  But of course when you're observing something with your naked eye even through a microscope you could it could appear to be scale like and it could be something else when you get a little bit closer.
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:35:06.000]  But this is this is pretty amazing magnification Mike I'm I'm really impressed and oh yeah you could it could be overlapping scaling or it could be like fissures right.
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  Well yeah just to be clear you know you're exactly right. We don't know what this is Dr. Ruby and I'm I'm not claiming that these are you know reptilian scales.
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:24.000]  I'm I'm just saying that they remind me of that visually they they kind of look like that. But this is on a much smaller scale. These are nano scale structures that we're actually looking at here.
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  So they're very very tiny. And but but thank you you know for reminding me to clarify that we we do not know what this is folks. But this is coming out of people's blood vessels and arteries and it's part of a much larger
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  structure. In fact I'm going to zoom out right now and show you that this is part of this massive clot structure.
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:54.000]  In fact I'll go ahead and zoom out more there. That's what we're that's the zoomed out version of what we're looking at.
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:36:07.000]  And I tried to pull this the so-called nano wire out of this clot. I tried to pull it out with the the the tweezers here and it did not want to come out. It's attached somehow. I'm not sure how.
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  But this is freaking me out a little bit. What are your thoughts. Hey Mike is it. Yeah me too. Of course is it possible to to get a look at the attachment point.
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:31.000]  You know where that wire that you're having a hard time pulling it out from you to get a look at that attachment to see if there's any structure that you haven't seen yet that is holding it right.
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  That's something that's a really good point Dr. Ruby. Unfortunately what happens is these samples dry once they're exposed to open air and when they dry they're no longer malleable.
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  So you know if I take these live samples out of this vial then they're still kind of rubbery and liquidy and I can manipulate them.
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:37:03.000]  But now that they're dried they become more fragile and I can't I can't really like tear it apart. I can't manipulate it with the the tweezers here.
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  Although if I find one of these again I'm going to do that. That's a really great suggestion.
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:17.000]  But you know just for those of you watching live let me insert the tweezers into the microscope image so you can see the size of the tweezers compared to this.
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:26.000]  I mean that's the tip of a tweezer right there. Yeah. And it is very massive. I mean so we're zoomed in right now at about.
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:37.000]  Well two hundred a thousand and at this point there's there's our structure and we can go even more. We can go fifteen hundred on this.
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  There we go. It almost looks a little hair like Mike you know like when hairs are lined up on each other. Yeah. Yeah it does.
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  But here's the thing you know I only even looked at a small sample of what Richard Hirschman sent me.
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:58.000]  There are so many more. I mean there are you know he's got bags of these things.
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  He's got refrigerators full of bags and you know you raise an interesting point. It could be that if you examine these samples you know maybe another bag from another day in another patient a month later you may find visually something very different.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:14.000]  That's right.
[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  Well we're seeing these white chalky particles something that looks like crystalline structures something that looks like really tiny maybe I say they resemble little circuits.
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  I don't know what they are. And then these so-called nanowires again that's just a physical resemblance we don't know what these are.
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  But clearly these are not blood plots because you know look I've got here's here's a piece of dried blood from earlier today there under the microscope right now that's dried blood.
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:46.000]  Yes.
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  Okay.
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:49.000]  And it's already kind of fragmenting by the way.
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  But what we are seeing looks nothing like blood plots.
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:39:03.000]  That's correct. It's very smooth. You can tell that when it was liquid there wasn't anything in it otherwise it would as it is it dried and shrunk.
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  Then anything in the blood would start to protrude. It was one of the things I called attention to in the OJ trial.
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  Any nurse or doctor worth their salt Mike would have said yeah the glove doesn't fit because it was soaked in blood. Blood is viscous and it shrinks when it's when it dries.
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  So yeah that blood that sample that you had looked like it was a clean you know wasn't filled with anything structurally.
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  That is so unusual Mike that string coming through.
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  Wow.
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:48.000]  Yeah these are very strange things now I you know I've done a lot of microscopy on food and I've seen you know some pretty creepy structures in food that are you know harvested from chickens or beef or what have you but I've never seen anything like this coming out of people's arteries.
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  And that's why I was so careful with Richard Hirschman to say are you sure that this is coming out of people's vascular system as you're you know pushing and bombing fluid through that system and he said yes absolutely.
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  He is certain and apparently other embalmers are certain of this as well.
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  But you've been trying to sound the alarm on this for a long time Dr. Ruby and you've been you know you've hit a lot of resistance.
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  Yeah I've heard a lot of resistance Mike I mean it hasn't gone much further until until you and your work now.
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  It really hasn't gone much further and I'm aware of directly aware of the fact that there are a few of a recognizable so to speak frontline doctors and experts that have had it and didn't get to it whatever their reasons were.
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  Didn't didn't take it any further and I'm not sure what that is about so we just kept hitting these walls Mr. Hirschman and I.
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:52.000]  And I again I was leaving him to do it because it was his material he owns it and I didn't want to get in the way of any chain of custody issues or anything like that.
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:41:04.000]  But eventually it just got to the point where I had to start really thinking who we could trust and that that took a while to figure out but yeah you know I want to call attention to something.
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:16.000]  I don't know if people are aware of this but after President Trump signed the executive order in 2019 Fauci Fauci said you know nano self assembling nano particles.
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:30.000]  I mean on page four I just want to read really quickly he says these platform technologies that we're going to bring forward and you can listen to this while you're looking at these samples include DNA messenger RNA which by the way was a lie because these
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:40.000]  are modified RNA they're not natural RNAs virus like particles vector based and bingo self assembling nanoparticle vaccines.
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  So this is what you're seeing developing here this is not a vaccine it's not here for your health it's not going to confer future protection.
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  In fact now we know thanks to your Mr. Hirschman's courage and your your work Mike and your courage now we know what this is is for and I just don't know how to get this to the larger part of the world right because I think if people
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:18.000]  see this and by the way speaking to Mr. Hirschman he has I brought that question up to him about you know people aren't going to believe this and so he did live videos pulling this out.
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  There's no way he could shove that in and then try to pull it out for a video.
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  Yeah that's right I saw me some of those videos and they're too graphic I think to show on the air but I've seen them and so thank you for reminding me but there are videos that show him pulling this out of the
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  embalming subjects and I've got something on screen right now another kind of nanowire structure that I found just while you were talking I'm just poking around see if you can show that on screen and we can move through the range of focus on that
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  so that people can kind of see that and that's also found on this clot that came out of a person's body.
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:43:16.000]  Stay with us we'll be right back much more straight ahead on The Alex Jones Show.
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:33.000]  As I said last week that they rule the earth the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group so now the fight's out in the open they're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  We're going to win this thing.
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:36.000]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:43.000]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you info wars would not be here.
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:55.000]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance so I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[2:43:55.000 --> 2:44:13.000]  Our world is so full of hype. We are force fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate media, by the controlled churches and the universities. Why is this the case? Because we innately by God have been given the keys to our own minds, our own psyches, our own souls.
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:29.000]  And by connecting to God we can empower ourselves and transcend the quote fallen or sinful state. So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to change who we are are only lowering us.
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:38.000]  They're only making us more depressed. In the end they're only making us less filled. It is only by going within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves.
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:51.000]  That's why the globe was bombarded with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:45:09.000]  And that's where the incredible products come in at M4store.com.
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:36.000]  It's 24.95. Alex Jones is right on the front, the Red Thunderbolt, and again on the back, a big bold M4store.com. Exercise your First Amendment. Don't let the leftist and the globalist bully silence you and fund the M4store at the same time.
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:46.000]  There is not a more politically incorrect shirt that sends a stronger message of freedom, resistance to the new world order than the Alex Jones was right shirt exclusively available at M4store.com.
[2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:55.000]  And again, this shirt is limited edition as well. We're doing one more run and then no more. M4store.com. Get yours today.
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  It's because the spirit I carry is one of justice and truth and courage and honor and will and love.
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  My friends, the enemies coming after me, not because I'm a loser, but because I'm a winner. They're coming after you, not because you're a bad person, because you're a good person, because you love God and God loves you.
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:46.000]  And so I signed up for this. I signed up for this fight. And I'm not a victim. I'm an overcomer. But I can't fight this fight without you. That's why I want you always to remember that I appreciate you.
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:47:07.000]  Because M4 is your fight. M4 is your baby. It's the thing you built. We did this together. So God bless you all. Let's keep fighting.
[2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:17.000]  Alright, final segment today here on The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salenti coming up in the fourth hour.
[2:47:17.000 --> 2:47:26.000]  And I'm joined now in this final segment by Dr. Jane Ruby continuing our discussion of what these mysterious clots are that are now being found.
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:39.000]  They are exploding in numbers in the bodies of people who are suddenly dying. And so, of course, these are strongly suspected of being the cause of death in a great many people.
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:50.000]  Dr. Ruby, during the break, I just brought up this kind of another nano strand of some kind on the microscope. If the producers can put that up, there we go.
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  That was found in this sample that I had prepped right here in the studio. So now it's starting to dry out so it looks a little less liquidy, but you're starting to see these strands and fibers.
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  Clearly, these are not blood clots. Clearly, these are, you know, advanced complex structures. What are your thoughts?
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:18.000]  Yeah, Mike, I've got a very interesting thought. You know, I've been working with experts all over the world for 18 months now, putting pieces together, looking at blood of people who've been jabbed and feel sick and things like that.
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  And that last picture you put up before the break, it just hit me right between my eyes. And I tried to send a couple of pictures, but you can't do it at the last minute with production.
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:37.000]  But there's a ribbon sort of aspect to what you just showed. It's kind of, if you look, the one you showed before we went to break sort of was a little wider.
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:44.000]  Even in this one, you can see there's a little bit of a luminescence. It's a flat ribbon sort of aspect to it.
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  This has been seen under so many different conditions, like blood microscopy and things like that.
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  It's been seen in the vials of all of the companies, all of the, well, we just got Novavax, but the first four.
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  It's been seen in blood over and over and over again, where you see the Rulio bloods, you know, stacking like coins, but wrapped around are those exact structures?
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  Those exact structures, yeah, fascinating.
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  In order for, in the whole realm of biology, for these structures to be constructed, there must be genetic instructions.
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  And genetic code, of course, describes protein synthesis. And these are clearly proteins, but they are not, at least, I mean, my guess is they're not spike proteins.
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  These are more like structural proteins that the body might typically use to build, you know, muscle or tissue or tendons or things like that.
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  So could this just be that, you know, the programming has gone haywire, that somehow the body is building another body inside its own arteries accidentally or something?
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  I mean, you know, or it's been invoked. I'm trying to find alternative explanations.
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  I hear you. Remember all the evidence and the documents and the patents and the communications from the Wuhan lab and the World Genome Bank talked about this was designed in silico.
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  This is a synthetic material. That's not, that's why it's not messenger RNA, which is natural organic RNA.
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  It is a synthetic version. God only knows what it's going to be programmed to do. And here's an example of it. But I have to go back to the second part, your question.
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  And I appreciate very much your desire to try to, you know, like, let's try, if we could find any other alternative explanation, because it's hard to believe that your government is no longer there and that your agencies have collapsed
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  and that there's some worldwide force that's actually trying to kill you off and make you suffer before they do it.
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:59.000]  But I go back again. This is an industry itself. It's being silenced. If any of this was innocent, there would be outcries from those organizations and agencies and governments that previously protected us.
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:09.000]  This is happening at the same time that a Google engineer is claiming that an artificial intelligence system built by Google has achieved consciousness.
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:23.000]  And it's called the Lambda system. Is it sentient? And I read the exchange between Google engineers and this Lambda system, which believes itself to be a person.
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:36.000]  And this AI system is able to write stories about its own state of consciousness, its own moods, its own observations about its own internal processes of cognition.
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:41.000]  I mean, it appears to be far more intelligent than any human being living alive.
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:54.000]  And yet you and I, Dr. Ruby, are talking about some kind of living tissue that is being grown somehow or constructed inside human bodies and is now showing up, you know, it's exploding in terms of its numbers.
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:52:11.000]  I don't think these things are disconnected in the sense that the so-called scientists are playing God with the definitions of life and they are building AI systems and they are playing around with the genetic code and building biological systems.
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:15.000]  Don't you agree that these are related?
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  They're 100% related. And my biggest concern, Mike, is that once you interfere with human DNA,
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:28.000]  now nature does it all the time, right? That's how you get cancer, that's how you get a lot of things.
[2:52:28.000 --> 2:52:39.000]  And sometimes there's a repair. But to do it intentionally and either to know the end game or to know part of it but not all of it is just incredibly dangerous.
[2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:43.000]  It comes down to, is this the world that you want to live in?
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:48.000]  Because eventually we will all be swallowed up by it if we don't stop it.
[2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:53.000]  I can't even get people to destroy, you know, mail-in drop boxes outside of their polling places.
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  How are we going to get them to, you know, really stop taking these shots and their loved ones as well?
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:03.000]  Now I'm going to let the viewers in on a little secret that you and I have here.
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:16.000]  Dr. Ruby and myself, we are collaborating now on the next phase of the analysis of these clots and we are going to jointly announce these findings roughly in about a week or so.
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:21.000]  And we will, of course, I'll initially publish on naturalnews.com.
[2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:25.000]  I'll give permission, Infowars, to repost that story.
[2:53:25.000 --> 2:53:27.000]  Dr. Ruby will be covering on your telegram channel.
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:30.000]  Dr. Jane Ruby, that's your telegram.
[2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:33.000]  Perhaps you or, I'm sorry?
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:40.000]  Yep, and my show, the Dr. Jane Ruby show on Red Voice Media and my bright tea on TV show on Monday nights live with Dr. Jane Ruby.
[2:53:40.000 --> 2:53:42.000]  So make sure it gets into both shows.
[2:53:42.000 --> 2:53:48.000]  Yes, thank you for that. I just want to say that everything that you and I find, we're going to try to share it here on Infowars.
[2:53:48.000 --> 2:53:54.000]  If Alex wants to be back in the studio to talk about it and have you on, that's great.
[2:53:54.000 --> 2:54:00.000]  Stu Peters will probably be covering it as well, I would imagine, because he's also very courageous in telling the truth about all this.
[2:54:00.000 --> 2:54:07.000]  I just got to say, this is a group effort of independent media and folks, this effort has only just begun.
[2:54:07.000 --> 2:54:15.000]  If you think that what you saw today was shocking, wait till you see what happens next week, because, well, we'll just leave it at that.
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:19.000]  Fair enough. Anything you want to say about that, Dr. Ruby?
[2:54:19.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  Well, you know, a lot of it is still going to be a surprise to me as well, because you, Mike, in this analysis, you're taking this to a level that no one either has, but hasn't let us know, or that no one ever has.
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  So you are moving the needle with these analyses, and I know that your second stage is going to be, if I understood it correctly, a little more on the chemical side and maybe composition side, which would be wonderful, even if we could just rule out certain things.
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:52.000]  Yeah, that's exactly right. That's all the hints you're going to get, folks, too, about what's coming up, but it's more than microscopy. We'll just put it that way.
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:55:03.000]  We're going to get some lab reports on what this stuff is. So, Dr. Ruby, I really want to thank you for your courage and your compassion for humanity, and just taking the time to join us today.
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  God bless you for all that you do.
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:15.000]  Well, thanks, Mike, for taking this on, and I'm just honored to work with you. I've followed your work for years, and so very happy to help out wherever I can.
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  Well, thank you so much. I mean, we're just honored to have you on, and we appreciate you joining us today.
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  Now, folks, Joe Salenti is coming up in the fourth hour. I want to thank Dr. Ruby for joining us and also Richard Hirschman and our first guest, the anonymous physician.
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  The Infowars Store summer sale has arrived. It's up to 60% off. Double Patriot points. And the reason I mentioned this is because the support of Infowars is so crucial.
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  We could not be here with all the crew and all the equipment, the infrastructure to be here is only made possible by you and your support.
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:56:07.000]  So check out InfowarsStore.com. They've got immune support, 60% off, whole food, multivitamin, hair and beard support, which is really a multivitamin that has many purposes outside of hair and beards, by the way.
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:15.000]  60% off. All the Dr. Jones natural products are 40% off, including the charcoal toothpaste, mouthwash, and many others.
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  All t-shirts are priced at cost. All of that is available at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  And I also want to thank all of you for supporting me and my work, and I want to thank the Infowars crew for allowing me to come in and kind of invade the space with these pretty grotesque little clot samples here.
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:42.000]  I think that's the first time that's happened here, but probably not the last, but hey, whatever it takes to tell the truth, that's what we're all about.
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:52.000]  Gerald Slenty is coming up in the fourth hour, and do not miss all the broadcasts this week because there's a lot of breaking news happening in the world right now.
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  The markets are getting hammered. Crypto is getting whipsawed right now. You need to get prepared financially with your food supplies, with backup communications,
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  self-defense gear, wear legal, make sure you acquire the firearms, the ammunition that you can legally obtain, and even stockpile, if necessary, because believe me, folks, a collapse is being engineered.
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  We, humanity, we are under attack from every possible vector, and this is the best place to get the truth. Infowars.com.
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  Well, thank you for watching today. Mike Adams here, the health ranger of naturalnews.com. Gerald Slenty comes up next from Trends Journal. God bless you all. We'll talk to you again soon. Take care.
[2:57:55.000 --> 2:58:02.000]  Go to www.preparetoday.com.
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:54.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the truth. We have the smoking gun evidence. We know what happened during the 2020 election. How the deep state-controlled Democrats
[2:58:54.000 --> 2:59:01.000]  stole the election. All the proof. Absolutely cut and dry. There's no denying it.
[2:59:01.000 --> 2:59:10.000]  It's the film 2000 Mules by Dineshta Sousa, and we have the DVD with the expanded extras available right now at infowarsstore.com.
[2:59:10.000 --> 2:59:21.000]  You can also get the DVD with massive discounts when you get it with other films like in-game blueprint for global enslavement and the new COVID-land, The Shot, Part 3, that just came out.
[2:59:21.000 --> 2:59:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the film every American must have. This is the most important documentary ever made in U.S. history because it proves that a major presidential election was stolen and it shows how they did it and how they're planning to do it again.
[2:59:37.000 --> 2:59:52.000]  Get 2000 Mules now at infowarsstore.com and show it to everyone you can so they don't steal the next election.
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:22.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:38.000]  Hey, great thing on the Alex Jones show. And listen everybody, do what you can to support Infowars. They're going to do everything they can to silence the truth. Censorship was one of our trends back in 2017.
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:55.000]  Censorship 2.0. It's so sad what's going on and how the media just sells its propaganda lies and when you don't swallow that they're garbage, they call you a conspiracy theorist.
[3:00:55.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  I mean, how stupid. And again, you know, remember that thing called the Iraq War? It was okay for them to sell those lies that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda.
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  And how dare you not believe those government officials and experts and people like Dick Cheney. Oh, I don't want to get censored. I have to be proper.
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  Penis Cheney. One after another, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell.
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:40.000]  Oh, that wasn't a conspiracy theory. And a guy by the name of Scott Ritter was the UN. He's none of this proof that there's nothing there, no weapons of mass destruction.
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:54.000]  And they censor him. And by the way, we're having a peace and freedom rally up here in Kingston, New York on July 23.
[3:01:54.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  And Scott Ritter is going to be one of the speakers, Gary Null, Judge Andrew Napolitano. They're going to have great music, great damn band, boy, they rock and roll and bopping in a reel and rocking in a rolling.
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:15.000]  Yep. Good times. Food, drink.
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:27.000]  Four corners of freedom. John and Crown Street, the only place in America with pre-revolutionary warstone buildings on each corner. And this will be in the Garden of the 1750s, Franz Roganhaus.
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  And so please get here, do what you can. We're doing everything we can to have a peace movement.
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:42.000]  You know, you see what's going on now with this Ukraine war. And it's just the BS is coming out over and over again.
[3:02:42.000 --> 3:02:50.000]  U.S. officials say Russia will likely control a region in eastern Ukraine within weeks.
[3:02:50.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  And this is according to an unnamed senior U.S. official told the Washington Post. Oh, no kidding.
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:14.000]  Oh, now Biden is saying that Zelensky didn't believe him when they said Russia was going to invade and they didn't do anything to negotiate for peace.
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:18.000]  And what do we say before the war started?
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:33.000]  Napoleon couldn't beat the Russians and sent 422,000 men, young boys, who believed as crap to go invade Moscow and came back with only 10,000.
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:45.000]  If Hitler launching Operation Barbarossa, they killed only 25 million Russians or 27 million, depending on whose numbers you look at, couldn't beat them in World War II.
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:51.000]  What makes you think the Russians are going to lose to Ukraine?
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:58.000]  What will Biden do if Putin goes nuclear? Experts say the nuclear response is unlikely, but not impossible.
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  Oh, experts say? Oh, what kind of experts? The same little low life pieces of scum garbage crap that you haven't won a war since World War II?
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:17.000]  And you're telling me about your expertise, Junior? How about our expertise?
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:26.000]  World War III has started. It'll only become official when a nuclear bomb drops.
[3:04:26.000 --> 3:04:35.000]  It was on with Rick Wiles and True News. That's exactly what he said. We're in tough times.
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:44.000]  We must unite for peace. United we stand, divided we die, and support InfoWars.
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:57.000]  You need these products as much as you need InfoWars, and the price is right. We're going to be right back. Stay tuned.
[3:04:57.000 --> 3:05:06.000]  It's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when the Internet and mobile technology first came out, which is we thought this is going to level the playing field.
[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:11.000]  Everybody's going to have access to the same information, and everybody's going to be able to freely communicate that information.
[3:05:11.000 --> 3:05:17.000]  That's our goal, to get back to that place where we all have access to all of the information.
[3:05:17.000 --> 3:05:23.000]  We all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever we want,
[3:05:23.000 --> 3:05:32.000]  and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying to judge us, or categorize us, or figure out some way to go after us
[3:05:32.000 --> 3:05:41.000]  because of the conversations we're having, because of the Internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions, the people we want to talk to about these things.
[3:05:41.000 --> 3:05:47.000]  That's our goal, is to help people take back their freedom by helping them to take back their privacy.
[3:05:47.000 --> 3:05:57.000]  And so that's really what we're trying to do, and so I hope that everybody listening will check us out at boltowireless.com, that's B-O-L-T-A, wireless.com.
[3:06:18.000 --> 3:06:20.000]  Hey, great P90 Alice Jones show.
[3:06:20.000 --> 3:06:22.000]  And like I said, do everything you can to support this.
[3:06:22.000 --> 3:06:24.000]  It's not like you're giving your money away.
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:35.000]  You're getting great products for it, and you really need them to build your immune system, and to get in the best shape you can, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[3:06:35.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  We're in the fight for our lives.
[3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:51.000]  You know, it's just, what's going on here, you're seeing all these people that are still getting all the shots, and still getting the virus, right?
[3:06:51.000 --> 3:06:52.000]  One after another.
[3:06:52.000 --> 3:06:55.000]  A little true dope up there in Canada.
[3:06:55.000 --> 3:06:59.000]  Yep, fully vaxed, and fully COVID.
[3:06:59.000 --> 3:07:02.000]  One after another.
[3:07:02.000 --> 3:07:07.000]  So you got it, you know, I got no vaxes at all, and I haven't gotten COVID.
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:11.000]  I haven't been sick in over three years.
[3:07:11.000 --> 3:07:16.000]  Every year I say, I hope I don't get a cold, hope I don't get a sore throat, you know, hope I don't get the flu.
[3:07:16.000 --> 3:07:20.000]  And I did, I took a lot of supplements to build my immune system.
[3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:28.000]  And you can do the same thing to do yours, and InfoWars has a lot of those great products that will help you.
[3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:39.000]  So going back to this Ukraine disaster, we said at the very beginning that Ukraine should negotiate because they're going to lose.
[3:07:39.000 --> 3:07:42.000]  Now, Biden's even saying it as well.
[3:07:42.000 --> 3:07:50.000]  And in your Trends Journal, we quoted this guy, DeLula, who's running for president against Bolsonaro in Brazil.
[3:07:50.000 --> 3:08:00.000]  And him saying, making fun of, this guy's, you don't get to the left of DeLula, and making fun of Zelensky for not negotiating for peace.
[3:08:00.000 --> 3:08:08.000]  $56 billion of our dough has gone to bloody the killing fields in Ukraine.
[3:08:08.000 --> 3:08:12.000]  Again, every time I drive around, I'm so disgusted.
[3:08:12.000 --> 3:08:15.000]  I'm like in a third world country.
[3:08:15.000 --> 3:08:25.000]  We've got a comedian who played, you know, piano with, as you know what, and he's running Ukraine.
[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:26.000]  A comedian.
[3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:35.000]  A comedian that played the president of Ukraine on a TV show is now the president of Ukraine and telling the people what to do.
[3:08:35.000 --> 3:08:38.000]  And we're the people standing up to fight this.
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:40.000]  It's a losing war.
[3:08:40.000 --> 3:08:43.000]  And you're hearing it more and more.
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:48.000]  Ukraine to decide how much territory it trades for peace.
[3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:59.000]  NATO Secretary General Jen Stoltenberg said on Sunday that the U.S.-led alliance aims to strengthen Ukraine's position at a negotiation table,
[3:08:59.000 --> 3:09:05.000]  but added that any peace deal would involve compromises, including territory.
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:27.000]  This is the same arrogant little jerk off over there in NATO, Stoltenberg, a member of the club, an arrogant, arrogant, arrogant little boy,
[3:09:27.000 --> 3:09:40.000]  an arrogant nobody, that man-to-man. I can't say the words, but he wouldn't either pee a poop if you called him out.
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:42.000]  Let's go back.
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:50.000]  Not ancient history, Stoltenberg off over there in NATO.
[3:09:50.000 --> 3:10:03.000]  And in this review of the Washington Post, NATO General Jen Stoltenberg said Ukraine should not avoid declaring ambitious war aims of driving Russia out of eastern Donbass region
[3:10:03.000 --> 3:10:10.000]  and the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia has controlled since 2014.
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:12.000]  This is June 3.
[3:10:12.000 --> 3:10:14.000]  And now fat mouth over there.
[3:10:14.000 --> 3:10:17.000]  Hey, you're doing a 180.
[3:10:17.000 --> 3:10:19.000]  Yeah.
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:26.000]  Or maybe you're doing a transgender return.
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:28.000]  All right.
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:31.000]  You're losing.
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:34.000]  You should negotiate a peace before this happened.
[3:10:34.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  And these are the little crap heads that they pump up.
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:44.000]  These are the imbecilic morons that are running and ruining our lives.
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:54.000]  They're eventually ill jerks off over there in NATO in a country near you.
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:11:04.000]  They have the right to say they are fighting for the whole of Ukraine, Stoltenberg said.
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:06.000]  Yep.
[3:11:06.000 --> 3:11:08.000]  All these weapons of death.
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:13.000]  Hey, where are all you Catholic priests?
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:18.000]  Where are all you Protestant bishops?
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:22.000]  Where are the Jews, the Muslims?
[3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:24.000]  Hey, Mohammed, I haven't seen you around.
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:26.000]  Where are all you people?
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:29.000]  How come you're not talking about peace?
[3:11:29.000 --> 3:11:33.000]  I don't hear a people about peace.
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:35.000]  We are going to fight.
[3:11:35.000 --> 3:11:36.000]  Yeah.
[3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:38.000]  I'm a Yankee doodle dandy, huh?
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:41.000]  A Yankee doodle do or die.
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:44.000]  We're going to bring us into World War I singing about it.
[3:11:44.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  And happiness can be, huh?
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:50.000]  We got crazy people in charge.
[3:11:50.000 --> 3:11:59.000]  And that was brought to you World War I by mentally ill Woodrow Wilson, the former president of Princeton.
[3:11:59.000 --> 3:12:00.000]  That's right.
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:05.000]  Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Bollocks, bombs, and banks.
[3:12:05.000 --> 3:12:11.000]  The same low life scum that brought us to Federal Reserve.
[3:12:11.000 --> 3:12:18.000]  Woodrow Wilson brought us to public education system, the government education system.
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:25.000]  Woodrow Wilson brought us federal tax.
[3:12:25.000 --> 3:12:41.000]  Woodrow Wilson made you rotten hell because you're a demonic piece of slime and the other ones could join the club.
[3:12:41.000 --> 3:12:43.000]  Yeah.
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:45.000]  Harvard, Princeton, Yale.
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:52.000]  Look at that arrogant little boy we got as the, uh, our Secretary of State.
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:54.000]  Anthony Blinken.
[3:12:54.000 --> 3:12:55.000]  Yeah.
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:12:57.000]  A daddy's boy.
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:12:59.000]  Another arrogant daddy's boy.
[3:12:59.000 --> 3:13:00.000]  I went to Dalton.
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:02.000]  Then I went to Harvard.
[3:13:02.000 --> 3:13:13.000]  Oh, and then I went to Yemen to give them intelligence on how they, it's a Saudi Arabia rather, so they could bomb and kill more people in Yemen.
[3:13:13.000 --> 3:13:18.000]  But I speak so properly because I am a daddy's boy, a member of the club.
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  Harvard, Princeton, Yale, bullets, bombs, and banks.
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:33.000]  Robbing us of our freedom, stealing our money, where these little slimmers never work a day in their lives.
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:36.000]  Oh, but they're officials, so that's right.
[3:13:36.000 --> 3:13:42.000]  Official pieces of crap.
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:44.000]  Obama.
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:49.000]  Oh yeah, now Obama is even questioning whether Ukraine could win.
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:51.000]  Anthony Blinken.
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:54.000]  U.S. Secretary of State.
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:55.000]  Look at him.
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:58.000]  Arrogant little Blinken, you murderer.
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:01.000]  There wasn't a war that you didn't love a push for.
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:03.000]  You are a murderer.
[3:14:03.000 --> 3:14:06.000]  Hey, the fish rots in their head down.
[3:14:06.000 --> 3:14:07.000]  All right.
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:09.000]  Wonder why young kids are blowing people out.
[3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:10.000]  Hey, I'm Obama.
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:11.000]  That guy, Gaddafi.
[3:14:11.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  I want a man here.
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:13.000]  You got it?
[3:14:13.000 --> 3:14:14.000]  Oh, no.
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:15.000]  So then he speak properly.
[3:14:15.000 --> 3:14:17.000]  Assad has to go.
[3:14:17.000 --> 3:14:19.000]  Gaddafi has to go.
[3:14:19.000 --> 3:14:21.000]  You don't say I want him.
[3:14:21.000 --> 3:14:22.000]  I want that guy dead.
[3:14:22.000 --> 3:14:23.000]  You got it?
[3:14:23.000 --> 3:14:24.000]  Oh, no, no, no.
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  Be proper.
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:29.000]  There wasn't a war that Blinken didn't love.
[3:14:29.000 --> 3:14:31.000]  Just like Biden.
[3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:32.000]  Biden the drafter.
[3:14:32.000 --> 3:14:34.000]  You're Vietnam.
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:35.000]  Yep.
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:37.000]  Clinton became.
[3:14:37.000 --> 3:14:38.000]  We saw he died.
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:42.000]  How happy he was that Gaddafi was killed.
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:46.000]  And there he is, Obama, the Nobel piece of crap prize winner.
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:49.000]  You're going to do a chip surge in Afghanistan.
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:52.000]  Oh, yeah, just kill more of our people and kill more of them.
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:55.000]  Hey, but the military industrial complex is getting rich.
[3:14:55.000 --> 3:14:58.000]  Oh, Raytheon's moving to D.C.
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:02.000]  The second biggest defense contractor in America.
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:04.000]  They're all moving to D.C.
[3:15:04.000 --> 3:15:05.000]  Boeing.
[3:15:05.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  Oh, Raytheon.
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:09.000]  Hey, who's the guy playing our department of defense?
[3:15:09.000 --> 3:15:12.000]  Oh, Lloyd Austin.
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:13.000]  Yeah.
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:15.000]  Oh, who was he?
[3:15:15.000 --> 3:15:16.000]  Oh, he's a general.
[3:15:16.000 --> 3:15:17.000]  Salante.
[3:15:17.000 --> 3:15:18.000]  Yeah.
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:22.000]  Oh, general sitting on the board of directors of Raytheon.
[3:15:22.000 --> 3:15:25.000]  They're all moving into Washington, D.C.
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:27.000]  You got it.
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:29.000]  World War III has begun.
[3:15:29.000 --> 3:15:32.000]  They're only interested in money.
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:35.000]  Just like the drug lords that people call big pharma.
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:37.000]  Yeah.
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:42.000]  The military industrial complex that Dwight D. Eisenhower,
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:45.000]  five-star general warned us about.
[3:15:45.000 --> 3:15:48.000]  Robbing us of the future of the scientists,
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:49.000]  the genius of the scientists,
[3:15:49.000 --> 3:15:52.000]  the laborers in the future of the children.
[3:15:52.000 --> 3:15:53.000]  We'll be right back.
[3:15:53.000 --> 3:15:55.000]  Stay tuned.
[3:15:55.000 --> 3:15:57.000]  William, California.
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:16:00.000]  People are asleep and programmed controlled.
[3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:01.000]  I agree.
[3:16:01.000 --> 3:16:03.000]  How do you make the sleeper awaken, William?
[3:16:03.000 --> 3:16:04.000]  Hi, Alex.
[3:16:04.000 --> 3:16:05.000]  Thanks for taking my call.
[3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:07.000]  Can I plug Alex real quick?
[3:16:07.000 --> 3:16:08.000]  Yeah, go ahead.
[3:16:08.000 --> 3:16:09.000]  Hey, I'm in my 60s,
[3:16:09.000 --> 3:16:12.000]  and I did the work of 25, 30-year-olds,
[3:16:12.000 --> 3:16:14.000]  and I worked them into the ground,
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:15.000]  and you wanted to know why?
[3:16:15.000 --> 3:16:16.000]  And I've tested this,
[3:16:16.000 --> 3:16:26.000]  and I've taken your B-12, and let me tell you,
[3:16:26.000 --> 3:16:28.000]  when I don't take it, I pay a price.
[3:16:28.000 --> 3:16:29.000]  I really do.
[3:16:29.000 --> 3:16:32.000]  I take that B-12, and I am electric, man.
[3:16:32.000 --> 3:16:33.000]  I can run 10 miles.
[3:16:33.000 --> 3:16:36.000]  I do some pretty heavy work with a highway department,
[3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:39.000]  and my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah,
[3:16:39.000 --> 3:16:43.000]  for a guy in his 60s pushing 70,
[3:16:43.000 --> 3:16:46.000]  I mean, I'm not just blowing smoke here.
[3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:48.000]  The B-12 saves my life.
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:16:59.000]  Every single person listening to the sound of my voice
[3:16:59.000 --> 3:17:02.000]  needs to listen to me very, very carefully.
[3:17:02.000 --> 3:17:05.000]  Dinesh D'Souza made the most important documentary
[3:17:05.000 --> 3:17:07.000]  in U.S. history.
[3:17:07.000 --> 3:17:09.000]  2,000 mules.
[3:17:09.000 --> 3:17:10.000]  That's not hype.
[3:17:10.000 --> 3:17:12.000]  That's the truth.
[3:17:12.000 --> 3:17:15.000]  The film proves how the Deep State Democrats
[3:17:15.000 --> 3:17:17.000]  stole the 2020 election
[3:17:17.000 --> 3:17:20.000]  and how they're planning to do it again.
[3:17:20.000 --> 3:17:21.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:17:21.000 --> 3:17:22.000]  with all the censorship going on,
[3:17:22.000 --> 3:17:24.000]  it is critical to own the DVD

[3:17:30.000 --> 3:17:31.000]  your business, your neighbors,

[3:18:03.000 --> 3:18:05.000]  And one of the biggest tools we've had to
[3:18:05.000 --> 3:18:07.000]  circumvent and override the censors
[3:18:07.000 --> 3:18:09.000]  has been Patriot Apparel
[3:18:09.000 --> 3:18:11.000]  so we can identify each other,
[3:18:11.000 --> 3:18:12.000]  so we can spread the word,
[3:18:12.000 --> 3:18:14.000]  and so we can push people to websites
[3:18:14.000 --> 3:18:15.000]  like infowarstore.com
[3:18:15.000 --> 3:18:17.000]  so they can understand the globalist plan
[3:18:17.000 --> 3:18:18.000]  and how to stop it.
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:19.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:18:19.000 --> 3:18:20.000]  two months ago we announced

[3:18:22.000 --> 3:18:23.000]  of t-shirts,

[3:18:25.000 --> 3:18:26.000]  All these shirts are limited edition.
[3:18:26.000 --> 3:18:27.000]  They are about to be history,
[3:18:27.000 --> 3:18:29.000]  and will only exist in your closet,
[3:18:29.000 --> 3:18:31.000]  your drawer, or your wardrobe.
[3:18:31.000 --> 3:18:33.000]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts
[3:18:33.000 --> 3:18:35.000]  of 60 plus thousand left.
[3:18:35.000 --> 3:18:36.000]  In a couple weeks,
[3:18:36.000 --> 3:18:37.000]  they'll all be gone,
[3:18:37.000 --> 3:18:38.000]  and they'll be history.
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:40.000]  We're selling them all at cost
[3:18:40.000 --> 3:18:42.000]  at infowarstore.com.

[3:19:54.000 --> 3:20:05.000]  while getting great products.
[3:20:24.000 --> 3:20:26.000]  With full assault on the lies
[3:20:26.000 --> 3:20:28.000]  of the New World Order,
[3:20:28.000 --> 3:20:30.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:30.000 --> 3:20:31.000]  And now,
[3:20:31.000 --> 3:20:36.000]  your host, Gerald Salente.
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:38.000]  Hey everybody,
[3:20:38.000 --> 3:20:41.000]  great being on the Alex Jones show
[3:20:41.000 --> 3:20:44.000]  on Info Wars.
[3:20:44.000 --> 3:20:46.000]  Again,
[3:20:46.000 --> 3:20:49.000]  it's up to you to support the truth.
[3:20:49.000 --> 3:20:53.000]  Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger,
[3:20:53.000 --> 3:20:54.000]  remember this,
[3:20:54.000 --> 3:20:57.000]  going back into the 80s,
[3:20:57.000 --> 3:20:59.000]  it was a big, big, big
[3:20:59.000 --> 3:21:02.000]  anti-nuclear protest in New York.
[3:21:02.000 --> 3:21:06.000]  About a million people turned out.
[3:21:06.000 --> 3:21:09.000]  And the next day,
[3:21:09.000 --> 3:21:11.000]  the Defense Secretary at the time,
[3:21:11.000 --> 3:21:14.000]  Casper Weinberger,
[3:21:14.000 --> 3:21:17.000]  was on any TV in New York,
[3:21:17.000 --> 3:21:18.000]  so you could Google it up
[3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:20.000]  and you could hear it yourself.
[3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:21.000]  He said,
[3:21:21.000 --> 3:21:22.000]  the fact that a very large number
[3:21:22.000 --> 3:21:24.000]  of people turn out for a particular event
[3:21:24.000 --> 3:21:27.000]  is certainly something that people notice.
[3:21:27.000 --> 3:21:29.000]  But I don't think that anybody rushes back
[3:21:29.000 --> 3:21:30.000]  and says,
[3:21:30.000 --> 3:21:32.000]  we have to change our policy
[3:21:32.000 --> 3:21:37.000]  or something because there's been a rally.
[3:21:37.000 --> 3:21:39.000]  The point being is that
[3:21:39.000 --> 3:21:41.000]  you got to keep this thing going.
[3:21:41.000 --> 3:21:44.000]  And Info Wars is doing that.
[3:21:44.000 --> 3:21:46.000]  The people are giving everything they can
[3:21:46.000 --> 3:21:50.000]  to make this a winning situation.
[3:21:50.000 --> 3:21:52.000]  And it's a win-win situation
[3:21:52.000 --> 3:21:55.000]  because you have to prepare for the worst
[3:21:55.000 --> 3:21:57.000]  and the worst is coming.
[3:21:57.000 --> 3:22:03.000]  And PrepareToday.com from Info Wars
[3:22:03.000 --> 3:22:05.000]  has what you need.
[3:22:05.000 --> 3:22:08.000]  And they finally created Prepare.com.
[3:22:08.000 --> 3:22:10.000]  It's a one-stop shop
[3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:12.000]  to get the highest quality,
[3:22:12.000 --> 3:22:15.000]  storable foods and preparedness gear.
[3:22:15.000 --> 3:22:16.000]  As I said,
[3:22:16.000 --> 3:22:18.000]  we did it in the trench journal
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:20.000]  before the war started in Ukraine
[3:22:20.000 --> 3:22:25.000]  two days before the Ukraine-Covid-War-World War.
[3:22:25.000 --> 3:22:27.000]  So this stuff is ready to ship
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:29.000]  and you see what's going on.
[3:22:29.000 --> 3:22:31.000]  The shortage is going on.
[3:22:31.000 --> 3:22:35.000]  And the stock is 100 award-winning certified preparedness items.
[3:22:35.000 --> 3:22:38.000]  So PrepareWithAlex.com
[3:22:38.000 --> 3:22:40.000]  will take you to the same site
[3:22:40.000 --> 3:22:44.000]  and it's their huge sponsor funding this operation.
[3:22:44.000 --> 3:22:46.000]  So Americans can get ready
[3:22:46.000 --> 3:22:48.000]  to be self-sufficient.
[3:22:48.000 --> 3:22:50.000]  Self-sufficiency, by the way,
[3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:52.000]  is one of our top trends for 2022.
[3:22:52.000 --> 3:22:54.000]  And fund the Info Wars
[3:22:54.000 --> 3:22:57.000]  while you're saving NASA's amounts of money
[3:22:57.000 --> 3:23:00.000]  on critical items that you need.
[3:23:00.000 --> 3:23:04.000]  And of course, getting things delivered quickly
[3:23:04.000 --> 3:23:06.000]  because it's in stock
[3:23:06.000 --> 3:23:08.000]  and you can see how things get out of stock
[3:23:08.000 --> 3:23:10.000]  and how short they can become.
[3:23:10.000 --> 3:23:13.000]  So PrepareToday.com
[3:23:13.000 --> 3:23:16.000]  is the only way you fail
[3:23:16.000 --> 3:23:18.000]  is by not visiting PrepareToday.com.
[3:23:18.000 --> 3:23:20.000]  Again, you prepare for the worst.
[3:23:20.000 --> 3:23:23.000]  If the worst doesn't happen, you lose nothing.
[3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:25.000]  If the worst doesn't happen and you're not prepared,
[3:23:25.000 --> 3:23:27.000]  you lose everything.
[3:23:27.000 --> 3:23:30.000]  So Failing to Prepare is preparing to fail.
[3:23:30.000 --> 3:23:34.000]  Visit PrepareToday.com.
[3:23:34.000 --> 3:23:37.000]  They have what you need for the future
[3:23:37.000 --> 3:23:39.000]  and the future is rough.
[3:23:39.000 --> 3:23:41.000]  I mentioned that little true dope.
[3:23:41.000 --> 3:23:44.000]  Got all the shots and got COVID again, again.
[3:23:44.000 --> 3:23:47.000]  And the same thing with our Health Secretary,
[3:23:47.000 --> 3:23:50.000]  the Sarah Test Positive for COVID-19
[3:23:50.000 --> 3:23:53.000]  twice in less than a month.
[3:23:53.000 --> 3:23:55.000]  Twice in less than a month
[3:23:55.000 --> 3:23:58.000]  and these little slime balls out there,
[3:23:58.000 --> 3:24:00.000]  the little prostitutes,
[3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:03.000]  media whores that get paid to put out
[3:24:03.000 --> 3:24:05.000]  by their corporate pimps
[3:24:05.000 --> 3:24:07.000]  and their government whormasters,
[3:24:07.000 --> 3:24:09.000]  call you a conspiracy theorist
[3:24:09.000 --> 3:24:12.000]  and stupid if you don't get
[3:24:12.000 --> 3:24:15.000]  their operation, warp speed,
[3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:18.000]  gene therapy and oculation,
[3:24:18.000 --> 3:24:22.000]  get the boost, get the virus.
[3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:24.000]  Oh, and those little comedians,
[3:24:24.000 --> 3:24:26.000]  they had a Kimmel Clowns
[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:28.000]  and a Colbert Freaky little boy,
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:30.000]  all these little jerks
[3:24:30.000 --> 3:24:33.000]  off over there in Hollywood
[3:24:33.000 --> 3:24:35.000]  selling the Vaxes.
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:38.000]  People are dumb enough to listen to comedians.
[3:24:38.000 --> 3:24:40.000]  Of course they are.
[3:24:40.000 --> 3:24:42.000]  Dumb enough to believe Georgie Bush,
[3:24:42.000 --> 3:24:44.000]  another little daddy's boy.
[3:24:44.000 --> 3:24:46.000]  It's George Cullen, the great George Cullen
[3:24:46.000 --> 3:24:48.000]  says, one big club and you ain't in it.
[3:24:48.000 --> 3:24:51.000]  It's a big club, a little jerks.
[3:24:51.000 --> 3:24:53.000]  Mentally ill.
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:55.000]  Get this in your head.
[3:24:55.000 --> 3:24:57.000]  These are mentally ill people
[3:24:57.000 --> 3:24:59.000]  but unlike you, Selenti,
[3:24:59.000 --> 3:25:02.000]  who become passionate and angry
[3:25:02.000 --> 3:25:05.000]  when people try to mess with you,
[3:25:05.000 --> 3:25:07.000]  they know how to do it properly.
[3:25:07.000 --> 3:25:09.000]  That's why they're in these positions.
[3:25:09.000 --> 3:25:11.000]  They know how to suck up
[3:25:11.000 --> 3:25:14.000]  and bow down to the truth.
[3:25:14.000 --> 3:25:16.000]  They will do anything
[3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:17.000]  to spread their lies.
[3:25:17.000 --> 3:25:19.000]  Look at this little jerk.
[3:25:19.000 --> 3:25:22.000]  Look at these little clowns,
[3:25:22.000 --> 3:25:24.000]  little true dope, a daddy's boy,
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:25.000]  another daddy's boy.
[3:25:25.000 --> 3:25:29.000]  You be nobody, you little arrogant boy.
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:33.000]  You're an arrogant little boy.
[3:25:33.000 --> 3:25:36.000]  My daddy was Justin.
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:43.000]  Oh, yes.
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:45.000]  We're going down.
[3:25:45.000 --> 3:25:47.000]  Look at the markets.
[3:25:47.000 --> 3:25:48.000]  Look what's going on.
[3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:49.000]  Look at inflation.
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:51.000]  Are you ready for this one?
[3:25:51.000 --> 3:25:55.000]  Hey, front page of Financial Times.
[3:25:55.000 --> 3:25:58.000]  U.S. said to plunge into recession next year.
[3:25:58.000 --> 3:26:00.000]  Economists predict.
[3:26:00.000 --> 3:26:05.000]  Well, if they predicted, yep.
[3:26:05.000 --> 3:26:09.000]  If they predicted, we said this was going to happen.
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:12.000]  It's in detail in your Trends Journal
[3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:21.000]  for over a year and a half.
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:24.000]  They pumped this thing up with cheap money,
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:29.000]  totally artificially inflated.
[3:26:29.000 --> 3:26:32.000]  Now tumbles in stock-centered bear market.
[3:26:32.000 --> 3:26:34.000]  Oh, worries are rate hikes.
[3:26:34.000 --> 3:26:37.000]  You mean you're going to cut off the monetary methadone
[3:26:37.000 --> 3:26:41.000]  that you've been injecting into the money junkies on Wall Street?
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:44.000]  They need their methadone, the monetary methadone.
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:48.000]  Yeah, that's all it is.
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:51.000]  The trillions of dollars they pumped into artificially
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:54.000]  prop up the economy after these sick people,
[3:26:54.000 --> 3:26:58.000]  these mentally ill people locked down our economy.
[3:26:58.000 --> 3:27:00.000]  We're going to fight the COVID war.
[3:27:00.000 --> 3:27:02.000]  We're going to make up crap.
[3:27:02.000 --> 3:27:06.000]  Stand six feet apart.
[3:27:06.000 --> 3:27:08.000]  When you're going to a restaurant, put on a mask.
[3:27:08.000 --> 3:27:11.000]  But when you sit down, you could take it off and eat
[3:27:11.000 --> 3:27:15.000]  because the virus knows when you're eating and walking.
[3:27:15.000 --> 3:27:17.000]  All right.
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:20.000]  They destroyed our economy with this cheap money.
[3:27:20.000 --> 3:27:22.000]  They artificially propped it up.
[3:27:22.000 --> 3:27:26.000]  Why gold prices are down now, I don't know why.
[3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:29.000]  They say they're going down because Treasury yields now
[3:27:29.000 --> 3:27:37.000]  3% and it's a safe investment and gold yields no interest.
[3:27:37.000 --> 3:27:38.000]  I don't get financial advice.
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:43.000]  I'm still bullish on gold because if this thing goes down,
[3:27:43.000 --> 3:27:46.000]  the only reason a dollar is going up is because all the other
[3:27:46.000 --> 3:27:50.000]  currencies are so bad and the other countries are in worse shape.
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:53.000]  They tank it.
[3:27:53.000 --> 3:27:56.000]  And it's only going to get worse.
[3:27:56.000 --> 3:28:02.000]  And by the way, when all else fails, they take you to war.

[3:28:41.000 --> 3:28:43.000]  Oh, it's different weather over there in South Korea.

[3:31:11.000 --> 3:31:14.000]  and so we can push people to websites like infowars.com
[3:31:14.000 --> 3:31:17.000]  so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[3:31:17.000 --> 3:31:19.000]  Now ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced
[3:31:19.000 --> 3:31:22.000]  we're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts.
[3:31:22.000 --> 3:31:24.000]  Some of which go back more than 25 years.
[3:31:24.000 --> 3:31:26.000]  All these shirts are limited edition.
[3:31:26.000 --> 3:31:31.000]  They are about to be history and will only exist in your closet, your drawer, or your wardrobe.
[3:31:31.000 --> 3:31:34.000]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left.

[3:32:49.000 --> 3:32:51.000]  PrepareToday.com
[3:32:51.000 --> 3:32:53.000]  PrepareToday.com
[3:32:53.000 --> 3:33:16.000]  And I'll see you there.
[3:33:23.000 --> 3:33:28.000]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:28.000 --> 3:33:31.000]  And again, do what you can to support info wars.
[3:33:31.000 --> 3:33:34.000]  They're fighting for freedom and we are too.
[3:33:34.000 --> 3:33:42.000]  We're going to have a peace and freedom rally festival up here in Kingston, New York.
[3:33:42.000 --> 3:33:48.000]  On July 23rd, on the four corners of freedom, John Crown Street.
[3:33:48.000 --> 3:33:52.000]  The only place in America with pre-revolutionary warstone buildings on each corner.
[3:33:52.000 --> 3:33:54.000]  And we have three of them.
[3:33:54.000 --> 3:33:57.000]  And it's going to having in the garden of the Franz Roggenhaus.
[3:33:57.000 --> 3:33:59.000]  The hot damn band is going to be here.
[3:33:59.000 --> 3:34:02.000]  And of course we have Scott Riddleby's speaker.
[3:34:02.000 --> 3:34:04.000]  Judge Napolitano.
[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:06.000]  Great food.
[3:34:06.000 --> 3:34:07.000]  Free. It's free.
[3:34:07.000 --> 3:34:08.000]  It's open to everybody.
[3:34:08.000 --> 3:34:13.000]  And drinks, you know, going to have a good time, but we're going to unite for peace.
[3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:15.000]  July 23rd.
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:18.000]  And info wars is doing it as well.
[3:34:18.000 --> 3:34:26.000]  We're in a very critical time and these products that they have are products that you need to support them and to support yourself.
[3:34:26.000 --> 3:34:28.000]  So do what you can.
[3:34:28.000 --> 3:34:34.000]  You know, the markets, I just, you know, the break was almost down at 900 points.
[3:34:34.000 --> 3:34:39.000]  And this comes as no, no shock to transjournal subscribers.
[3:34:39.000 --> 3:34:41.000]  We had forecast this.
[3:34:41.000 --> 3:34:46.000]  Let's go back to over a year ago, almost almost a year over a year and a half.
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:54.000]  You had the Fed head drone Powell saying that inflation was transitory or temporary than transitory.
[3:34:54.000 --> 3:34:58.000]  And same thing with Janet Yellen, our treasury secretary.
[3:34:58.000 --> 3:35:03.000]  And again, if anybody's got a brain bigger than a P, you could figure this out.
[3:35:03.000 --> 3:35:09.000]  Our treasury secretary used to be a Fed head and then they brought over to run the treasury.
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:12.000]  So they're in complete control of our lives.
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:15.000]  These again, these are mentally ill people.
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:20.000]  They're only concerned about their own welfare and those of the club.
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  And she said back in April over a year ago that inflation would not go past 3%.
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:32.000]  And then last week, quote, she thought she was wrong.
[3:35:32.000 --> 3:35:33.000]  I think I was wrong.
[3:35:33.000 --> 3:35:38.000]  You think you think what do you think you were wrong.
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:35:47.000]  So again, you listen to the stupidity of those in charge.
[3:35:47.000 --> 3:35:54.000]  Biden, when he imposed sanctions on Russia, the oil sanctions, no oil coming in.
[3:35:54.000 --> 3:35:59.000]  And now, of course, oil around the United States is what?
[3:35:59.000 --> 3:36:06.000]  Over $5 a barrel on nationally in places like California is like $7.
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:09.000]  Last yesterday, I filled up my car.
[3:36:09.000 --> 3:36:14.000]  It was $85 and 68 cents.
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:16.000]  85 bucks.
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:21.000]  Oh, you think people want to commute back and forth to work?
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:24.000]  Anyway, the implications of this are very far and deep.
[3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:26.000]  And we write about them in the Trends Journal.
[3:36:26.000 --> 3:36:34.000]  But going back to BS Biden, quote, American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin.
[3:36:34.000 --> 3:36:36.000]  To Putin's war machine.
[3:36:36.000 --> 3:36:44.000]  That's the words coming out of his moronic mouth.
[3:36:44.000 --> 3:36:52.000]  When he put the sanctions on Russia on the gas and oil sanction.
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:54.000]  So he got it backwards.
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:36:59.000]  It did nothing to stop Putin.
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:05.000]  The powerful blow has hit Americans.
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:08.000]  But nobody calls them out.
[3:37:08.000 --> 3:37:10.000]  Nobody calls them out.
[3:37:10.000 --> 3:37:11.000]  You know what?
[3:37:11.000 --> 3:37:12.000]  They're prostitutes.
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:14.000]  They're media whores.
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:20.000]  They get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and their government whormasters.
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:24.000]  Going back to, again, the Ukraine war.
[3:37:24.000 --> 3:37:30.000]  CNN reports suggest that officials in Washington, London and Brussels
[3:37:30.000 --> 3:37:35.000]  are meeting without the Ukrainian counterparts in an effort to plant a ceasefire and peace settlement.
[3:37:35.000 --> 3:37:36.000]  Oh, officials?
[3:37:36.000 --> 3:37:39.000]  How about official pieces of crap?
[3:37:39.000 --> 3:37:40.000]  What officials?
[3:37:40.000 --> 3:37:43.000]  What officials?
[3:37:43.000 --> 3:37:45.000]  They're slimy lowlives.
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:37:48.000]  They're murderous creeps.
[3:37:48.000 --> 3:37:53.000]  That's the official language to use for them.
[3:37:53.000 --> 3:37:54.000]  No.
[3:37:54.000 --> 3:37:55.000]  Selenchi?
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:37:56.000]  I'm a little boy.
[3:37:56.000 --> 3:37:58.000]  I'm a lowlife girl.
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:01.000]  I bow down and do what they tell me.
[3:38:01.000 --> 3:38:04.000]  Put on that mask.
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:14.000]  Get that shot and inject your kids, even though they don't get it.
[3:38:14.000 --> 3:38:21.000]  All of these clowns shot their mouths off.
[3:38:21.000 --> 3:38:24.000]  And Ukraine was going to beat Russia.
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:26.000]  It's 100 days.
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:27.000]  100 days.
[3:38:27.000 --> 3:38:30.000]  We're there for 20 years up in Afghanistan.
[3:38:30.000 --> 3:38:35.000]  And you couldn't beat these lightly armed clowns up there, the Taliban.
[3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:37.000]  They're there 100 days.
[3:38:37.000 --> 3:38:39.000]  What are they going to lose?
[3:38:39.000 --> 3:38:40.000]  Oh, yeah.
[3:38:40.000 --> 3:38:41.000]  Remember?
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:42.000]  Yep.
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:45.000]  Our goal is clear.
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:48.000]  Putin must not win the war.
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:51.000]  I am convinced that he will not win it.
[3:38:51.000 --> 3:38:53.000]  Oh, that was the German guy.
[3:38:53.000 --> 3:38:54.000]  Shultz over there.
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:38:57.000]  Oh, you got that right.
[3:38:57.000 --> 3:39:02.000]  Our commitment is to be there for you until this fight is done.
[3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:07.000]  We stand with Ukraine until victory is won.
[3:39:07.000 --> 3:39:09.000]  How plosy.
[3:39:09.000 --> 3:39:11.000]  Hey, plosy.
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:15.000]  Maybe your husband's not drunk enough to drive over there and go fight.
[3:39:15.000 --> 3:39:17.000]  Send your kids and you go too.
[3:39:17.000 --> 3:39:18.000]  What do you mean?
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  What do you mean that we stand with Ukraine?
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:32.000]  You mean you're going to steal more of our money and give it to the military industrial complex?
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:34.000]  We will stand.
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:42.000]  Anybody that supports the war, put on your military drag and go fight.
[3:39:42.000 --> 3:39:48.000]  It is not my war, I am an American.
[3:39:48.000 --> 3:39:53.000]  I believe in George Washington, you little low-lives.
[3:39:53.000 --> 3:39:55.000]  No foreign entanglements.
[3:39:55.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  Selenti, calm down.
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:39:59.000]  You should love Obama.
[3:39:59.000 --> 3:40:03.000]  You should love the creeps in charge.
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:06.000]  How's that smiley Lewis over there?
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:07.000]  Oh, yeah.
[3:40:07.000 --> 3:40:11.000]  All these great generals, you guys haven't won a war.
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:13.000]  You love all your ribbons.
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:16.000]  Oh, I got this one for that and that one for this.
[3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:18.000]  It's not Halloween.
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:25.000]  You can take your costumes off.
[3:40:25.000 --> 3:40:28.000]  Ukraine clearly believes that it could win.
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:29.000]  You ready?
[3:40:29.000 --> 3:40:32.000]  And so does everyone here.
[3:40:32.000 --> 3:40:39.000]  That was from Secretary of our defense, Lloyd Austin.
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:44.000]  Yep.
[3:40:44.000 --> 3:40:46.000]  The armed forces of Ukraine are here.
[3:40:46.000 --> 3:40:51.000]  Most importantly, our people, the people of our nation are here.
[3:40:51.000 --> 3:40:55.000]  We have been defeated, defending our country for 100 days already.
[3:40:55.000 --> 3:40:57.000]  Victory will be ours.
[3:40:57.000 --> 3:41:02.000]  Glory to Ukraine, said Zelensky.
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:06.000]  Yep.
[3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:10.000]  And I have one message for you today, Zelensky.
[3:41:10.000 --> 3:41:13.000]  Ukraine will win.
[3:41:13.000 --> 3:41:15.000]  Ukraine will be free.
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:20.000]  You know, shut that crap out of his mouth?
[3:41:20.000 --> 3:41:23.000]  Boris Johnson.
[3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:27.000]  How can you get a more freaky little moron
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:31.000]  than that guy up there in the UK?
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:34.000]  Lying little Boris Johnson.
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:39.000]  These little flabby little boys, they couldn't fight.
[3:41:39.000 --> 3:41:44.000]  But boy, they sent your kids to go fight and die.
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:46.000]  Occupied peace.
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:49.000]  Go to occupiedpeace.com.
[3:41:49.000 --> 3:41:56.000]  We're going to be putting up the info about the July 23rd rally,
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:42:01.000]  the freedom, peace, and justice.
[3:42:01.000 --> 3:42:04.000]  Yep. They're taking us to war.
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:07.000]  When all else fails, they take you to war,
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:10.000]  and this economy is failing big time.
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:13.000]  The worst is yet to come.
[3:42:13.000 --> 3:42:17.000]  It hasn't even started yet.
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:19.000]  Businesses are going out, man.
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:24.000]  Oh, and women.
[3:42:24.000 --> 3:42:29.000]  This thing is going to go down hard and fast.
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:36.000]  You're going to start seeing civil unrest in countries around the world.
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:39.000]  Civil war is going to regional wars,
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  and then it's a world war if we don't unite for peace.
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:45.000]  So support info wars.
[3:42:45.000 --> 3:42:48.000]  Support the truth.
[3:42:48.000 --> 3:42:56.000]  And get to Trends Journal if you want to see history before it happens.

[3:46:00.000 --> 3:46:04.000]  and to remind you that we've been vindicated and that world government
[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:08.000]  and its tyrannical aim of depopulation is now out of the open.
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:12.000]  Everything you and I have done together has been historic.
[3:46:12.000 --> 3:46:15.000]  And we cannot continue in this fight without your support.
[3:46:15.000 --> 3:46:18.000]  I want to encourage you all to be part of history right now,

[3:46:39.000 --> 3:46:42.000]  at the most critical time in our 28-year history.
[3:46:42.000 --> 3:46:44.000]  So I want to thank you all for your support,
[3:46:44.000 --> 3:46:47.000]  and I want to encourage you all to be part of history
[3:46:47.000 --> 3:46:51.000]  and to get this historic memento that keeps us on air

[3:46:58.000 --> 3:47:02.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[3:47:02.000 --> 3:47:05.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:05.000 --> 3:47:08.000]  Hey, great B90 Alex Jones show.
[3:47:08.000 --> 3:47:11.000]  And again, you know, Alex is just saying,
[3:47:11.000 --> 3:47:15.000]  you know, look what's going on with the equity markets now.
[3:47:15.000 --> 3:47:19.000]  You know, it's, it just took a quick look.
[3:47:19.000 --> 3:47:22.000]  Dow's down almost 1,000 points.
[3:47:22.000 --> 3:47:25.000]  1,000 points, 970-something points.
[3:47:25.000 --> 3:47:27.000]  Well, I just looked.
[3:47:27.000 --> 3:47:29.000]  Yes, it is.
[3:47:29.000 --> 3:47:35.000]  The S&P, the NASDAQ, down over 4%.
[3:47:35.000 --> 3:47:39.000]  You look what happened, wiped out in Asia last night,
[3:47:39.000 --> 3:47:42.000]  wiped out in Europe.
[3:47:42.000 --> 3:47:45.000]  We've been warning about this.
[3:47:45.000 --> 3:47:47.000]  We've been giving you details about this.
[3:47:47.000 --> 3:47:50.000]  And by the way, Bitcoin just broke below our point
[3:47:50.000 --> 3:47:53.000]  of it could go down to,
[3:47:53.000 --> 3:47:56.000]  we're forecasting around that.
[3:47:56.000 --> 3:48:00.000]  It could go down to, we're forecasting around 10,000.
[3:48:00.000 --> 3:48:03.000]  Again, we've had all these numbers in the trends journal.
[3:48:03.000 --> 3:48:06.000]  Week after week, it's a weekly magazine.
[3:48:06.000 --> 3:48:08.000]  There's no magazine like in the world and I'm not saying it
[3:48:08.000 --> 3:48:10.000]  because I'm the publisher.
[3:48:10.000 --> 3:48:13.000]  It's only magazine that tells you what the world is going on,
[3:48:13.000 --> 3:48:16.000]  what it means and what's next and what you might want to do
[3:48:16.000 --> 3:48:18.000]  trend forecasts.
[3:48:18.000 --> 3:48:22.000]  So we are in critical times and we must unite
[3:48:22.000 --> 3:48:25.000]  and unite with infowars.
[3:48:25.000 --> 3:48:28.000]  If I do this, I don't get paid to do this.
[3:48:28.000 --> 3:48:33.000]  I do it because I believe in what Infowars Alex Jones is doing.
[3:48:33.000 --> 3:48:35.000]  And it's one of the few places out there,
[3:48:35.000 --> 3:48:37.000]  there are a couple, you know, there are great places.
[3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:43.000]  Gary Null will be a speaker up here on July 23rd.
[3:48:43.000 --> 3:48:46.000]  He does a progressive radio network.
[3:48:46.000 --> 3:48:50.000]  That's his station with a lot of great speakers on there,
[3:48:50.000 --> 3:48:52.000]  great people.
[3:48:52.000 --> 3:48:58.000]  And Scott Ritter and Judge Napolitano will be here.
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:49:00.000]  So we're looking at what's going on.
[3:49:00.000 --> 3:49:04.000]  This thing is going to go down big.
[3:49:04.000 --> 3:49:08.000]  People are going to realize how bad it is when these markets crash.
[3:49:08.000 --> 3:49:14.000]  It's not a matter of if it's a matter of when.
[3:49:14.000 --> 3:49:17.000]  And it's the same thing with this, you know, being prepared
[3:49:17.000 --> 3:49:19.000]  and having to do it.
[3:49:19.000 --> 3:49:23.000]  And then, of course, there's the whole other side where they're going to start hitting us with.
[3:49:23.000 --> 3:49:30.000]  And it's a great book, Leaving Humanity by Joe Durand who writes for us.
[3:49:30.000 --> 3:49:35.000]  And the corrupt designs of the technocratic elite,
[3:49:35.000 --> 3:49:40.000]  because they're going to take more and more advantage of us as things go down
[3:49:40.000 --> 3:49:45.000]  and things get worse, more mind control.
[3:49:45.000 --> 3:49:51.000]  Ukraine fears defeat in East without weapons supply.
[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:57.000]  That's from today's Wall Street Journal.
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:50:02.000]  As the U.S. and allies gather Wednesday to discuss fresh military aid.
[3:50:02.000 --> 3:50:06.000]  Military aid.
[3:50:06.000 --> 3:50:08.000]  Your partner is in crime.
[3:50:08.000 --> 3:50:10.000]  It's not military aid.
[3:50:10.000 --> 3:50:12.000]  You're a partner in crime.
[3:50:12.000 --> 3:50:15.000]  If somebody, I wanted a gun and I didn't have one.
[3:50:15.000 --> 3:50:17.000]  And I said, hey, give me a gun.
[3:50:17.000 --> 3:50:19.000]  I want to blow Freddie's brains out.
[3:50:19.000 --> 3:50:21.000]  And you gave me the gun.
[3:50:21.000 --> 3:50:26.000]  You'd be accessory to the crime.
[3:50:26.000 --> 3:50:31.000]  It depends on how fast and in what quantities these heavy weapons arrive.
[3:50:31.000 --> 3:50:33.000]  Isn't that great?
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:36.000]  They write that nicely.
[3:50:36.000 --> 3:50:41.000]  Murderous weapons to kill more people and destroy more cities rather than negotiate for peace.
[3:50:41.000 --> 3:50:42.000]  Why not?
[3:50:42.000 --> 3:50:43.000]  Because we're sick people.
[3:50:43.000 --> 3:50:46.000]  By the way, we're owned by the military industrial complex.
[3:50:46.000 --> 3:50:49.000]  And if you don't believe me, read the book,
[3:50:49.000 --> 3:50:51.000]  Wars of Racket by General Smedley Butler,
[3:50:51.000 --> 3:50:55.000]  the most decorated marine in history when he wrote it.
[3:50:55.000 --> 3:50:59.000]  Without a massive and rapid increase in military assistance.
[3:50:59.000 --> 3:51:01.000]  Isn't that nice words?
[3:51:01.000 --> 3:51:03.000]  They're prostitutes.
[3:51:03.000 --> 3:51:04.000]  They're media wars.
[3:51:04.000 --> 3:51:06.000]  That's the way they write.
[3:51:06.000 --> 3:51:10.000]  Ukraine faces defeat in East and Donbas region.
[3:51:10.000 --> 3:51:15.000]  Ukrainian officials, officials, officials, official pieces of crap.
[3:51:15.000 --> 3:51:16.000]  What officials?
[3:51:16.000 --> 3:51:18.000]  What officials?
[3:51:18.000 --> 3:51:21.000]  Stop with this garbage crap words, officials.
[3:51:21.000 --> 3:51:24.000]  Oh, it's dignitary, political dignitary.
[3:51:24.000 --> 3:51:25.000]  Oh, nobility.
[3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:29.000]  Well, now nobility is something different.
[3:51:29.000 --> 3:51:39.000]  Anyway, one, that would pave the way for Russia to pursue its offensive actions to Odessa
[3:51:39.000 --> 3:51:42.000]  and Kharkiv after regrouping.
[3:51:42.000 --> 3:51:43.000]  You got it.
[3:51:43.000 --> 3:51:49.000]  Western officials and analysts question whether Russia has the wherewithal.
[3:51:49.000 --> 3:51:57.000]  Again, Western officials, Western clowns, Western jerks.
[3:51:57.000 --> 3:52:00.000]  You've been wrong about everything.
[3:52:00.000 --> 3:52:02.000]  We've been right.
[3:52:02.000 --> 3:52:08.000]  But you don't have the guts to call a winner a winner because you're losers.
[3:52:08.000 --> 3:52:12.000]  We said this would happen before the war happened.
[3:52:12.000 --> 3:52:16.000]  We said it would happen before the war happened.
[3:52:16.000 --> 3:52:18.000]  But what do they do?
[3:52:18.000 --> 3:52:25.000]  Billions and billions, scores of billions of dollars, stealing our money to kill more people.
[3:52:25.000 --> 3:52:28.000]  Let's go back to the markets.
[3:52:28.000 --> 3:52:32.000]  They're blaming inflation on the Russian war.
[3:52:32.000 --> 3:52:36.000]  They're right about that much to some extent.
[3:52:36.000 --> 3:52:45.000]  The real inflation is because of all the cheap money that the Fed heads and the government bandits pumped into the markets
[3:52:45.000 --> 3:52:50.000]  when they locked down society with their moronic COVID war mandates.
[3:52:50.000 --> 3:52:55.000]  We're going to lock it down for two weeks and we're going to flatten the colleagues.
[3:52:55.000 --> 3:53:00.000]  Oh, Andy Cuomo, another daddy's boy.
[3:53:00.000 --> 3:53:03.000]  Little Andy Cuomo, another daddy's boy.
[3:53:03.000 --> 3:53:07.000]  And I'm naming the tap-n-z bridge after my daddy.
[3:53:07.000 --> 3:53:11.000]  And of course the 20 million dollars.
[3:53:11.000 --> 3:53:13.000]  You've got to put the M on.
[3:53:13.000 --> 3:53:15.000]  Take down the size, but the new ones.
[3:53:15.000 --> 3:53:20.000]  Mary Lou Cuomo.
[3:53:20.000 --> 3:53:21.000]  All right.
[3:53:21.000 --> 3:53:24.000]  We've got a bunch of jerks telling us what to do.
[3:53:24.000 --> 3:53:27.000]  They destroyed our economy.
[3:53:27.000 --> 3:53:30.000]  It's unprecedented.
[3:53:30.000 --> 3:53:33.000]  The streets are dead at night up here.
[3:53:33.000 --> 3:53:35.000]  Dead.
[3:53:35.000 --> 3:53:36.000]  Nine o'clock.
[3:53:36.000 --> 3:53:40.000]  Restaurants closing.
[3:53:40.000 --> 3:53:48.000]  Bars out of business, out of business, out of business.
[3:53:48.000 --> 3:53:52.000]  They artificially propped up this economy for two years.
[3:53:52.000 --> 3:54:03.000]  That the equity markets went up after they were crashing in March of 2020 was a joke.
[3:54:03.000 --> 3:54:08.000]  Total fraud.
[3:54:08.000 --> 3:54:12.000]  And now they're coming down.
[3:54:12.000 --> 3:54:15.000]  And we're telling you what you should do to prepare.
[3:54:15.000 --> 3:54:23.000]  In our way, an info was, is telling you how to prepare today in their way.
[3:54:23.000 --> 3:54:27.000]  And so get their products because you're going to need them.
[3:54:27.000 --> 3:54:30.000]  This thing's going down hard and heavy.
[3:54:30.000 --> 3:54:31.000]  Here's the here.
[3:54:31.000 --> 3:54:33.000]  And we got here.
[3:54:33.000 --> 3:54:37.000]  Ready?
[3:54:37.000 --> 3:54:38.000]  We got it.
[3:54:38.000 --> 3:54:39.000]  Get those products.
[3:54:39.000 --> 3:54:41.000]  But here we got this also.
[3:54:41.000 --> 3:54:43.000]  Front page of New York Wall Street Journal.
[3:54:43.000 --> 3:54:47.000]  Weaker earnings pose new threat to royal markets.
[3:54:47.000 --> 3:54:53.000]  The S&P 500 has dropped 18% in 2022.
[3:54:53.000 --> 3:54:54.000]  You ready?
[3:54:54.000 --> 3:55:10.000]  It's worth start to a year since 1962 as the Federal Reserve embarks on great rising.
[3:55:10.000 --> 3:55:13.000]  You know, they might, they might back off.
[3:55:13.000 --> 3:55:16.000]  They might back off on this.
[3:55:16.000 --> 3:55:22.000]  Because this thing is, this, this markets are going, they didn't even haven't done it yet.
[3:55:22.000 --> 3:55:26.000]  And you got things going down.
[3:55:26.000 --> 3:55:35.000]  So it's, they may only raise interest rates, maybe 50 basis points.
[3:55:35.000 --> 3:55:38.000]  They're talking about 75 basis points.
[3:55:38.000 --> 3:55:48.000]  But they, they may have to back off this because this thing's going down really, really hard.
[3:55:48.000 --> 3:55:49.000]  And it's global.
[3:55:49.000 --> 3:55:52.000]  That's the thing to get in your head.
[3:55:52.000 --> 3:55:57.000]  It's not only just America.
[3:55:57.000 --> 3:56:02.000]  So prepare today.com.
[3:56:02.000 --> 3:56:04.000]  Prepare today.com.
[3:56:04.000 --> 3:56:10.000]  Get your, what you need to prepare for the worst from Infowars.
[3:56:10.000 --> 3:56:17.000]  And to prepare, prevail and prosper, you're going to want to TrendsJournal at TrendsJournal.com.

[3:56:19.000 --> 3:56:23.000]  I'd pay $5 a day for the Wall Street Journal.
[3:56:23.000 --> 3:56:29.000]  $3 a day for the, for the New York Times.
[3:56:29.000 --> 3:56:33.000]  And how much do I get for the Financial Times, a good paper?
[3:56:33.000 --> 3:56:37.000]  $2.50.
[3:56:37.000 --> 3:56:40.000]  The TrendsJournal is $2 a week.
[3:56:40.000 --> 3:56:43.000]  30 day money back guarantee.
[3:56:43.000 --> 3:56:46.000]  Again, last week's like 165 pages.
[3:56:46.000 --> 3:56:50.000]  And the cover of the artwork is brilliant by Anthony Frieda.
[3:56:50.000 --> 3:56:57.000]  So in wrapping up, you better stay tuned to Infowars.
[3:56:57.000 --> 3:57:01.000]  You better prepare all you can, alert your friends, love ones.
[3:57:01.000 --> 3:57:04.000]  We're going down to very difficult times.
[3:57:04.000 --> 3:57:06.000]  Yep.
[3:57:06.000 --> 3:57:12.000]  And knowledge is power.
[3:57:12.000 --> 3:57:16.000]  And we're giving you all the knowledge we can, and so is Infowars.
[3:57:16.000 --> 3:57:25.000]  So remember, prepare today.com and TrendsJournal.com.
[3:57:25.000 --> 3:57:28.000]  This thing's going down hot and heavy.
[3:57:28.000 --> 3:57:31.000]  The worst is really yet to come.
[3:57:31.000 --> 3:57:34.000]  And we have to unite for peace.
[3:57:34.000 --> 3:57:39.000]  Remember the rally July 23rd, Kingston, New York, on the Four Corners of Freedom.
[3:57:39.000 --> 3:57:41.000]  Thanks for tuning in.
[3:57:41.000 --> 3:57:46.000]  We'll see you next week.
[3:57:46.000 --> 3:57:52.000]  Every single person listening to the sound of my voice needs to listen to me very, very carefully.
[3:57:52.000 --> 3:57:58.000]  The Nestuses have made the most important documentary in the U.S. history.
[3:57:58.000 --> 3:58:01.000]  2,000 mules. That's not hype.
[3:58:01.000 --> 3:58:02.000]  That's the truth.
[3:58:02.000 --> 3:58:07.000]  The film proves how the deep state Democrats stole the 2020 election
[3:58:07.000 --> 3:58:09.000]  and how they're planning to do it again.
[3:58:09.000 --> 3:58:12.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, with all the censorship going on,
[3:58:12.000 --> 3:58:17.000]  it is critical to own the DVD with the expanded extra so you have it in your library

[3:58:46.000 --> 3:58:48.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[3:58:48.000 --> 3:58:50.000]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[3:58:50.000 --> 3:58:51.000]  Welcome.
[3:58:51.000 --> 3:58:52.000]  Hello, Alex.
[3:58:52.000 --> 3:58:53.000]  Yes, Malcolm.
[3:58:53.000 --> 3:58:54.000]  All right.
[3:58:54.000 --> 3:58:56.000]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[3:58:56.000 --> 3:59:01.000]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[3:59:01.000 --> 3:59:04.000]  Supermail Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[3:59:04.000 --> 3:59:05.000]  Mix those two together.
[3:59:05.000 --> 3:59:07.000]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[3:59:07.000 --> 3:59:09.000]  Supermail Vitality really, really works.
[3:59:09.000 --> 3:59:13.000]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[3:59:13.000 --> 3:59:20.000]  And so it has a dramatic of compared to powdered versions that also work quite well but just aren't as strong.
[3:59:20.000 --> 3:59:22.000]  This is like a very fine wine.
[3:59:22.000 --> 3:59:24.000]  In fact, each batch is different.
[3:59:24.000 --> 3:59:25.000]  Sometimes it's super strong.
[3:59:25.000 --> 3:59:26.000]  Sometimes it's just okay.
[3:59:26.000 --> 3:59:29.000]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[3:59:29.000 --> 3:59:30.000]  That's just how it is.
[3:59:30.000 --> 3:59:32.000]  It's how it works.
[3:59:32.000 --> 3:59:34.000]  So it's always good.
[3:59:34.000 --> 3:59:36.000]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[3:59:36.000 --> 3:59:43.000]  If you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
