[00:00.000 --> 00:25.160]  We won that election, Al Gore won the election, Al Gore was elected President of the United
[00:25.160 --> 00:30.440]  States just wasn't counted. Do you know it? I know it. They know it. We won that election.
[00:30.440 --> 00:35.000]  There is overwhelming evidence that George W. Bush did not win this election. Do you
[00:35.000 --> 00:40.040]  think Republicans stole that election? In 2000, I wish the United States Supreme Court
[00:40.040 --> 00:45.600]  had let them finish counting the votes. The Supreme Court denied the actual and accurate
[00:45.600 --> 00:52.480]  counting of the votes of Florida. If Catherine Harris, Jeb Bush, Jim Baker, and the Supreme
[00:52.480 --> 00:59.760]  Court hadn't tampered with the results, Al Gore would be President. An election has been
[00:59.760 --> 01:08.960]  stolen, robbed. It wasn't a fair process. It wasn't a neutral process. It was a process
[01:08.960 --> 01:12.800]  that was rigged against us. We actually won the last presidential election, folks. They
[01:12.800 --> 01:18.320]  stole the last presidential election. As we look at our election system, I think it's
[01:18.320 --> 01:25.800]  fair to say that there are many legitimate questions about its accuracy, about its integrity.
[01:25.800 --> 01:30.160]  How are you going to keep it from us being able to be in a position where you can manipulate
[01:30.160 --> 01:34.160]  the machines, manipulate the records? In Virginia, while I was governor, I had to replace all
[01:34.160 --> 01:40.560]  the machines. Too many voters have cast votes on machines that jam or malfunction or suck
[01:40.560 --> 01:44.440]  the votes without a trace. I kept voting in the Senate race, kept voting for the Democrat,
[01:44.440 --> 01:48.600]  Republican name kept coming up. Three times that happened. How many other votes did the
[01:48.600 --> 01:54.600]  computers get wrong? I brought in some technology experts. They were able to hack into our machines
[01:54.600 --> 01:59.640]  from offsite in about five or six minutes, and within four minutes they were able to
[01:59.640 --> 02:06.520]  change a vote. The legitimacy of any president that's elected is going to be impaired unless
[02:06.520 --> 02:12.640]  the American people understand that there has been a full and fair count of all the
[02:12.640 --> 02:18.120]  votes. We will continue to object to the election procedures until they are corrected. The
[02:18.120 --> 02:23.440]  objection is in writing, and I don't care that it is not signed by a member of the Senate.
[02:23.440 --> 02:29.200]  It is our duty to challenge this vote. It's not as if it's just Republicans who have
[02:29.200 --> 02:33.040]  monkeyed around with elections in the past. Sometimes Democrats have to. I would be standing
[02:33.040 --> 02:41.680]  here saying this no matter what the outcome of the election. I just don't even know why
[02:41.680 --> 02:46.120]  there aren't uprisings of all of the country. Maybe there will be. People need to start
[02:46.120 --> 02:50.600]  taking to the streets. This is a dictator. You know, there needs to be unrest in the
[02:50.600 --> 02:55.480]  streets for as long as there's unrest in our lives. Enemies of the state. Show me where
[02:55.480 --> 03:00.920]  it says that protests are supposed to be polite and peaceful. Do something about your dad's
[03:00.920 --> 03:05.680]  immigration practices, you feckless. They go low, we kill them. How do you resist the
[03:05.680 --> 03:11.640]  temptation to run up and bring her neck? Biggest terror threat in this country is white men
[03:11.640 --> 03:15.520]  and most of them radicalized, rocked up to the right. I thought he should have punched
[03:15.520 --> 03:19.240]  him in the face. I said, even if you lost, he insulted your wife. He came down the escalator
[03:19.240 --> 03:21.760]  and called Mexicans rapists and murders. He said, well, what do you think I should have
[03:21.760 --> 03:23.760]  done? I said, I think you should have punched him in the face and then gotten out of the
[03:23.760 --> 03:27.680]  race. You would have been a hero. I'd like to punch him in the face. I said, if we're
[03:27.680 --> 03:31.680]  in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him. Punch some
[03:31.680 --> 03:36.880]  people in the face. When was the last time an actor assassinated a president? They're
[03:36.880 --> 03:43.520]  still going to have to go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump. And that's a fact. Look as
[03:43.520 --> 03:53.000]  his character is stabbed to death. Where is John Wilkes Booth when you need him? I have
[03:53.000 --> 03:59.800]  thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House. A Missouri state senator is under
[03:59.800 --> 04:05.760]  investigation by the Secret Service after saying she hopes President Trump is assassinated.
[04:05.760 --> 04:12.760]  I will go and take Trump out tonight. And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant,
[04:12.760 --> 04:20.760]  in a department store, in a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you
[04:20.760 --> 04:28.600]  push back on them and you tell them they're not welcome anymore and anywhere. And sadly,
[04:28.600 --> 04:34.800]  the domestic enemies to our voting system and our honoring our Constitution are right
[04:34.800 --> 04:39.760]  at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. They're not going to stop before Election Day in November and
[04:39.760 --> 04:43.960]  they're not going to stop after Election Day. And that should be, everyone should take note
[04:43.960 --> 04:48.760]  of that on both levels, that this isn't, they're not going to let up and they should not. If
[04:48.760 --> 05:00.760]  you think we're rallying now, you ain't saying nothing yet.
[05:00.760 --> 05:06.720]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right. People ask
[05:06.720 --> 05:11.040]  what's it like to be vindicated? Well, it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew
[05:11.040 --> 05:16.960]  this was coming. I tried to stop it. And now everything I've talked about is going to become
[05:16.960 --> 05:23.120]  more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and
[05:23.120 --> 05:29.760]  documents. It's now out in the open. Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth.
[05:29.760 --> 05:35.280]  The Bilderberg Group founded Davos Group. So now the fight's out in the open. They're
[05:35.280 --> 05:39.480]  making their move because they know they're behind schedule. We're going to win this thing.
[05:39.480 --> 05:43.080]  God's watching the children counting on us. I just want to thank the viewers and listeners
[05:43.080 --> 05:47.440]  for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you,
[05:47.440 --> 05:51.040]  info wars would not be here. I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are
[05:51.040 --> 05:55.800]  the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance. So I want to thank
[05:55.800 --> 06:00.800]  you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[06:00.800 --> 06:14.920]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex
[06:14.920 --> 06:24.920]  Jones show. And now your host, Owen Shroyer. Well, ladies and gentlemen, did you like that?
[06:24.920 --> 06:33.560]  Did you like that little intro? Some may have missed they're picking up some of the radio
[06:33.560 --> 06:40.480]  syndicates today in the first five minutes. We played a compilation of Democrats denying
[06:40.480 --> 06:46.520]  election results, pushing back against election results, followed by another compilation of
[06:46.520 --> 06:52.960]  Democrats calling for violence, direct violence, even killing the president. It's amazing,
[06:52.960 --> 07:00.440]  isn't it? They're allowed to do that, but you're not. They're allowed to burn entire
[07:00.440 --> 07:04.960]  cities to the ground, but you're not even allowed to stand in Washington, D.C. if you're
[07:04.960 --> 07:11.360]  a Trump voter. They're allowed to engage in political assassination attempts and mass
[07:11.360 --> 07:22.960]  murder attempts, but you're not even allowed to question an election. And I believe most
[07:22.960 --> 07:30.720]  people watching that hearing last night, let's say that were neutral. If there was neutral
[07:30.720 --> 07:36.080]  audience members last night, I'd say most people watch that and saw that and they didn't
[07:36.080 --> 07:41.800]  think, oh boy, Trump's scary or oh boy, Republicans are scary. No, they sat there and they said,
[07:41.800 --> 07:49.440]  wow, this Democrat party is scary. There has never been a more aggressive. There's never
[07:49.440 --> 08:00.480]  been a more obtuse. There has never been a more unabashed politically motivated and
[08:00.480 --> 08:12.800]  corrupt hearing or investigation or lie campaign, however you want to describe it, as what we
[08:12.800 --> 08:19.240]  saw last night. And I got to be honest. You know, I'm somebody that's pretty well aware
[08:19.240 --> 08:28.080]  of what's going on here and I'm involved in it. And even for me watching that last night
[08:28.080 --> 08:33.120]  had a tinglies going up my spine, not the good kind, not the good kind when you know
[08:33.120 --> 08:39.160]  you're making a lifelong memory, not the good kind when you're having a smashing successor.
[08:39.160 --> 08:44.600]  You're hearing a perfect sound or you're having a perfect moment. No, no, no, no, not the
[08:44.600 --> 08:49.480]  good kind, the bad kind, the bad kind that a bad guy is about to come up from behind
[08:49.480 --> 08:54.920]  you and stab you. The bad kind that you're free falling and you don't know when you're
[08:54.920 --> 09:01.960]  going to land or if you're going to make it. No, I had tinglies up my spine like, wow,
[09:01.960 --> 09:11.640]  a reminder just how corrupt our country is and just how corrupt this Democrat party is.
[09:11.640 --> 09:18.680]  And it just makes you wonder, doesn't it? You just can't help but ask the obvious questions.
[09:18.680 --> 09:27.960]  Which might be, the answers to might be meaningless because the result is the same. But I mean
[09:27.960 --> 09:36.200]  everybody on that panel knows they're lying. So why? What is the motivating factor? Are
[09:36.200 --> 09:44.120]  they really just doing it for politics? Are they taking money from some sort of anti-American
[09:44.120 --> 09:50.040]  force that they're just openly working for another team behind the scenes? Are they just
[09:50.040 --> 09:55.960]  literally paid actors? Just the Democrats just pay actors to pretend like their representatives
[09:55.960 --> 10:03.880]  like AOC. I think that's been more clear than ever that AOC is nothing more than an actress.
[10:03.880 --> 10:10.440]  She keeps lying about her experience on January 6th, faking tears. That's an actress, folks.
[10:10.440 --> 10:19.640]  That is an actress. So even I, somebody that is dealing with this, follows it every day,
[10:19.640 --> 10:27.320]  very much informed and aware of what's going on. Even I watch something like that and say,
[10:27.320 --> 10:38.560]  wow. I'm not even sure I can fully comprehend what I just watched. How do you properly respond
[10:38.560 --> 10:45.440]  to an entire panel of liars that know they're lying and know what they're doing as a sham
[10:45.440 --> 10:52.320]  and a fraud and know they're total hypocrites? How do you deal with that? How do you respond
[10:52.320 --> 10:56.280]  to that? I mean, it'd be one thing, hey, we could all just ignore it, but it wouldn't
[10:56.280 --> 11:06.960]  go away. The consequences of it would not go away. But seriously, what motivates these
[11:06.960 --> 11:16.920]  people to go up there and lie? And then all the lies that get told by the media? So again,
[11:16.920 --> 11:21.240]  you know, part of me wants to open up the phone lines and ask how you felt watching
[11:21.240 --> 11:24.600]  that. We've got a lot of great guests today, and maybe we'll try to squeeze in some phone
[11:24.600 --> 11:30.040]  calls. But I got Pete Santilli coming up at 11.30. I got Roger Stone and Darren Beatty
[11:30.040 --> 11:34.960]  coming up at 12.30 with breaking news as well. I'm expecting to hear from Alex before the
[11:34.960 --> 11:44.080]  end of today's transmission too. But I'll tell you how I felt. I felt like I've lost
[11:44.080 --> 11:53.400]  my country. And it was a feeling that honestly, I've only had a few other times, and that's
[11:53.400 --> 11:59.360]  literally when I was being arrested and thrown into jail for my free speech and for my politics
[11:59.360 --> 12:06.680]  when I spent nights in jail as a political prisoner, feeling like I've lost my country.
[12:06.680 --> 12:10.560]  This is not my country anymore. This is something else. This country hates me. This country wants
[12:10.560 --> 12:17.600]  me dead. This country wants me enslaved. And I'm sitting there watching it last night,
[12:17.600 --> 12:25.000]  feeling that exact same sinking feeling and just wondering what is the what is the right
[12:25.000 --> 12:33.360]  thing to do here? How much longer do you really put up with this before you just say it's
[12:33.360 --> 12:42.320]  over America's America's gone. We've lost. Now, I don't want to pontificate too much
[12:42.320 --> 12:47.800]  more on that because that's not the news. That's more of the psychological impact these
[12:47.800 --> 12:54.280]  liars and crooks running our country have on us and their sham hearing has on us from
[12:54.280 --> 13:03.920]  last night. That that's more of a caller based topic show. And maybe I'll do that Sunday
[13:03.920 --> 13:07.720]  because I got the big guests coming up today and Christy Lee is going to be hosting the
[13:07.720 --> 13:14.040]  war room. She might want to take your calls. But I got to tell you, watching that was like
[13:14.040 --> 13:26.440]  being kicked in the balls over and over again because it sucks to have to sit there and
[13:26.440 --> 13:33.120]  think about, wow, everything I'm fighting for, everything I'm putting my livelihood on the
[13:33.120 --> 13:39.640]  line for, which is just wanting this country to exist, wanting freedom to persist, wanting
[13:39.640 --> 13:42.860]  to live in the land of the free and the home of the brave, wanting to live with the Bill
[13:42.860 --> 13:51.320]  of Rights and the Constitution as our founding principles and documents. But is it gone? Is
[13:51.320 --> 13:57.720]  it gone? Is it just totally gone? Can it be restored? Is America lost? Can we ever recover
[13:57.720 --> 14:10.600]  from corruption like this without the worst happening? I don't know. And I don't want
[14:10.600 --> 14:20.880]  to be a part of the worst happening. Now, there's any hope. Most people don't buy the
[14:20.880 --> 14:27.400]  lives of the Democrats. I think last night's hearing is going to backfire. But will it actually
[14:27.400 --> 14:32.000]  have real consequences? Will we actually have real elections? Will Republicans actually
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.600]  follow through on their pledge to investigate the investigators? I don't know. Only time
[14:37.600 --> 14:44.600]  will tell. And I think we'll have a pretty good idea coming up in 151 days in the midterms.
[14:44.600 --> 14:51.800]  But man, oh, man, if we can't, if we, if Republicans don't have victories in the midterms,
[14:51.800 --> 14:59.600]  I just, I don't know how much longer this country can take it, folks. And I'll tell
[14:59.600 --> 15:03.800]  you this, if Republicans don't have victories in the midterms, if you think the Democrats
[15:03.800 --> 15:12.000]  are bad now, oh my, it will be 10 times worse if Republicans don't have major victories
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.160]  in the midterms. It will be 10 times worse. I mean, they're just going out and arresting
[15:17.160 --> 15:22.760]  their political opposition at will now. And I got people calling me about last night asking
[15:22.760 --> 15:29.440]  me about it. And I'm saying, I think it's pretty clear at this point that January 6th
[15:29.440 --> 15:33.560]  for the Democrats is never going to go away. And they're going to arrest their political
[15:33.560 --> 15:39.920]  opposition at any given moment with the, with the excuse of January 6th. I mean, it could
[15:39.920 --> 15:46.080]  be 20 years down the road and you'll be sitting in your house reading about Donald Trump winning
[15:46.080 --> 15:51.400]  the 2020 election and some FBI Democrat will come kick in your door, point a gun at your
[15:51.400 --> 15:55.560]  face and take you to prison and disappear your forever. That's where this Democrat Party
[15:55.560 --> 16:02.560]  is going, like the most corrupt authoritarian regimes in the history of this planet.

[20:33.960 --> 20:39.960]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:39.960 --> 20:46.960]  Growing up as a child, I would hear my grandparents on both sides of my family talk about the
[20:47.880 --> 20:52.120]  interesting lives of my ancestors that led and how they were people that stood up for
[20:52.120 --> 20:58.240]  freedom and were known throughout history for their complete and absolute dedication
[20:58.240 --> 21:04.320]  to freedom, whether it was back in England or whether it was back in France or Germany
[21:04.320 --> 21:09.840]  or here in the United States with the Mayflower and 1776 and the rest of it. Then of course
[21:09.840 --> 21:14.680]  the Texas Revolution. I almost thought back when I was younger that my family was bragging.
[21:14.680 --> 21:18.600]  It was almost kind of shameful. I had this sense inside myself that I had to achieve
[21:18.600 --> 21:23.880]  things myself and it was just kind of ridiculous that they were so proud of their ancestors
[21:23.880 --> 21:28.000]  but they were actually proud of who they were and who I was. They wanted me to know what
[21:28.000 --> 21:33.160]  I came from and what I was made of. I bet if you check your history, you've got some
[21:33.160 --> 21:36.920]  incredible people back there as well. Let's remember our ancestors and let's realize
[21:36.920 --> 21:41.920]  they give us a lot of strength. Let's defeat evil together.
[21:41.920 --> 21:48.080]  Thank you, Alex Jones. We're back here live on the Alex Jones Show. I'm sure we're filling
[21:48.080 --> 21:53.280]  in for Alex again today and honor a pleasure to be with you as we're witnessing this human
[21:53.280 --> 22:00.960]  history. You know, this is a true test for America, folks. It's a true test for her people
[22:00.960 --> 22:10.640]  as well. That's us. Nations fall and rise on God's great planet and great consciousness.
[22:10.640 --> 22:18.560]  Good and evil competes, wins, loses and we're just in the throes of one of the most epic
[22:18.560 --> 22:25.600]  battles of good and evil in human history and in this country's history. Not that the
[22:25.600 --> 22:35.200]  current, not that the current cycle that we're in is the worst it's ever been but the potential
[22:35.200 --> 22:42.400]  impact or what follows it could be the worst it's ever been. And that's the implications
[22:42.400 --> 22:45.600]  if they're able to conquer this country. That's the implications if they're able to remove
[22:45.600 --> 22:50.280]  the Bill of Rights in the First Amendment, in the Second Amendment, in free and fair elections.
[22:50.280 --> 22:55.440]  And that is, they might still let us have the ceremony of the United States of America.
[22:55.440 --> 23:00.120]  They might even let us have a border on a map still. But for all intents and purposes,
[23:00.120 --> 23:03.200]  there will be no more freedoms. There will be no more God-given rights. There will be
[23:03.200 --> 23:08.000]  no more borders. You'll be in the corporate world government, under the World Health Organization,
[23:08.000 --> 23:12.380]  run by Bill Gates, run by Klaus Schwab, run by the World Economic Forum. You'll own nothing.
[23:12.380 --> 23:18.680]  You'll have no rights. You'll eat the bugs and it'll just be global slavery, global government.
[23:18.680 --> 23:24.960]  And then the challenge to get out of that, now that might be the most difficult endeavor
[23:24.960 --> 23:31.080]  that mankind will ever have to undertake. But see, we don't want to get there. That's
[23:31.080 --> 23:39.560]  the point. And so that's why we're here, now, trying to stop that from happening.
[23:39.560 --> 23:52.880]  Let me do this. Man, oh man, I've got so much content today and I just, it's just, it's
[23:52.880 --> 24:01.520]  just frustrating, folks. So let me just do this real quick, before we get our first
[24:01.520 --> 24:08.040]  guest on Pete Santilli. I don't want the nation to collapse. I've got a whole stack
[24:08.040 --> 24:14.080]  of news here. I mean, here's the headlines. Food prices hitting record high, avocado prices
[24:14.080 --> 24:20.680]  hitting record high, supply chain shortages. Now there's a shortage of tampons. I guess
[24:20.680 --> 24:24.280]  that's because they're putting them in boys' bathrooms now. So, you know, that's a problem.
[24:24.280 --> 24:32.200]  U.S. inflation, 8.6 in May. It's like 10% every month now. Britain's food supply at risk.
[24:32.200 --> 24:38.720]  Michigan police won't respond to 9-11 calls because they can't afford gas. So this is
[24:38.720 --> 24:44.000]  exactly what the Biden administration promised they would do, collapse the economy and the
[24:44.000 --> 24:53.120]  energy sector, put you into domestic servitude of the great reset. To stop man-made climate
[24:53.120 --> 24:59.520]  change. Yeah, right. To stop man. Everything after that's made up. To stop man. So if you
[24:59.520 --> 25:07.640]  aren't prepared for a collapse, folks, you're just nuts. And look, I understand it's not
[25:07.640 --> 25:12.280]  really something you want to do. It's not really something you want to talk about. And
[25:12.280 --> 25:16.480]  it's like, you know, insurance. You don't like paying the forced car insurance or the
[25:16.480 --> 25:22.000]  house insurance or all this stuff. But I mean, do you have insurance for a collapse? Do you
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.200]  have insurance for the Biden administration and the Democrats and the globalist and the
[25:26.200 --> 25:30.520]  World Economic Forum collapsing this country? Do you have insurance for that? Do you have
[25:30.520 --> 25:37.680]  storeable foods? Do you have emergency food supplies? Do you have water filtration? We've
[25:37.680 --> 25:48.880]  got all of that available for you at preparetoday.com. Preparetoday.com. So I mean, you're looking
[25:48.880 --> 25:53.600]  all around you folks. You're seeing the signs of civilization collapse. You know what the
[25:53.600 --> 26:00.120]  agenda is from the Democrats, the World Economic Forum and Build Back Better. So you know that's
[26:00.120 --> 26:07.080]  going on. Why wouldn't you hedge against that to make sure that if society collapses, civilization
[26:07.080 --> 26:15.080]  collapses as they plan to, you're not insured so that you're not in a desperate situation.
[26:15.080 --> 26:21.880]  You've got emergency food supplies and other emergency supplies from preparetoday.com.
[26:21.880 --> 26:27.920]  So cannot recommend that enough. And by the way, it's the highest quality storeable foods.

[26:31.240 --> 26:37.520]  price. Don't waste your time. We've already done it. That's why preparetoday.com exists
[26:37.520 --> 26:44.560]  and we're already selling out of some of this stuff. So get there quickly. Preparetoday.com.
[26:44.560 --> 26:55.080]  All right. Man, oh man. Let me revisit something quickly from yesterday. Let me just revisit
[26:55.080 --> 27:02.400]  something quickly that's kind of off topic. But I couldn't help but want to revisit this
[27:02.400 --> 27:12.240]  today. And that's the Joy Behar clip from yesterday because I'm not sure there's been
[27:12.240 --> 27:21.920]  a more unabashed racist moment in the history of live television. At least one that's not,
[27:21.920 --> 27:27.160]  you know, at least one that's not intended comedy or satire or something like that. No,
[27:27.160 --> 27:34.960]  this was Joy Behar openly showing her racism, pointing her finger at a black woman saying
[27:34.960 --> 27:41.920]  when blacks get guns, we'll ban them then. And it's an amazing thing. So here's the
[27:41.920 --> 27:44.720]  clip and I want to kind of break it down. I got 60 seconds. I'm going to try to do this
[27:44.720 --> 27:48.200]  clip quickly. Here's the clip I'm talking about.
[27:48.200 --> 27:55.200]  Okay. Let me say one more thing. So that's all I'm saying is that they're not just crazy
[27:55.200 --> 27:58.960]  people. Here's the thing. Once black people get guns in this country, the gun laws will
[27:58.960 --> 28:07.240]  change. Trust me. That's what happens. I just, I'm amazed. I have never seen a more racist
[28:07.240 --> 28:11.280]  live moment in television in the history of my life. And guys, I want you to try to do
[28:11.280 --> 28:16.200]  something quickly for me here. There's three screen grabs that really show this moment.
[28:16.200 --> 28:23.080]  It's Joy Behar. It's basically at, there's two at the 10 second mark of Joy Behar pointing
[28:23.080 --> 28:27.040]  her finger at the black woman. And then the black woman's first response, I don't know
[28:27.040 --> 28:30.400]  her name. I should probably know it by now. And then her second response, but you can
[28:30.400 --> 28:34.760]  see in real time the racism from Joy Behar pointing at a black woman saying when you
[28:34.760 --> 28:40.520]  get guns, we'll ban them. And then you can, you can see this woman's face like she just
[28:40.520 --> 28:46.480]  got hit with raw racism on live TV. And you can see like at first she's like, she's like
[28:46.480 --> 28:50.160]  shocked like, Oh my gosh, you're saying that. And then, and then her second look is this
[28:50.160 --> 28:55.960]  pure devastation like, Oh my God, I just got, I just experienced racism on live TV. This
[28:55.960 --> 29:11.040]  is unbelievable. It's liberals prepare today.com, prepare today.com or simply follow the URL

[33:31.440 --> 33:38.440]  And with me now is Pete Santilli, the Pete Santilli show, and we're going to get his
[33:44.920 --> 33:51.920]  breakdown and reaction to the sham hearing the Hollywood made for TV sham hearing that
[33:52.440 --> 33:59.440]  was last night. And Pete, let me just start the conversation off by saying this. I don't
[33:59.440 --> 34:06.440]  know if there's ever been a better example put on display with such a mass media push
[34:08.040 --> 34:15.040]  behind it of where the country is currently at. I mean, a banana republic, the Politburo,
[34:15.800 --> 34:21.000]  I mean, the Ministry of Truth. I really don't even know how to properly classify what we
[34:21.000 --> 34:28.000]  witnessed last night other than just total political corruption, total partisanship,
[34:28.000 --> 34:34.760]  a total sham, total fraud. And it's just, it's just totally encompassing of everything
[34:34.760 --> 34:41.760]  that an authoritarian tyrannical regime represents. And it's just, it's, it's unbelievable to
[34:41.760 --> 34:47.520]  think that this is what we're experiencing now in America. A panel of nine liars that
[34:47.520 --> 34:52.560]  know they're lying, know what they're doing is political hackery. The media goes along
[34:52.560 --> 34:59.400]  with it. I mean, I just, it's sad, Pete, that, that our great country is at such a low point
[34:59.400 --> 35:00.840]  right now.
[35:00.840 --> 35:07.240]  There's, there's a positive side of it. You know, previously we've had this vague and
[35:07.240 --> 35:12.280]  ambiguous stuff that they throw out there and you can never really hold these people accountable.
[35:12.280 --> 35:18.160]  But here's the beautiful side of this thing. For those of you that watched that first hearing,
[35:18.160 --> 35:23.200]  they were probably disgusted, if not nauseated like I was, especially when we need to talk
[35:23.200 --> 35:30.200]  about this, what they did to Staff Sergeant, decorated Staff Sergeant Combat War veteran,
[35:31.560 --> 35:37.520]  Joe Biggs, was not only a travesty of justice, we should never allow that to have happened
[35:37.520 --> 35:42.000]  to any American, of course, but especially not somebody that's received two purple hearts
[35:42.000 --> 35:46.840]  and served as his country honorably. They want to go after Trump at the expense of Staff
[35:46.840 --> 35:51.480]  Sergeant Joe Biggs. Here's the beautiful side of all of this is as a result of this first
[35:51.480 --> 35:58.480]  hearing, I'm going to call this out right now. There was an attorney that gave a presentation
[35:58.480 --> 36:04.760]  framed Alex Jones himself. I've put that information out there. Stuart Rhodes, Alex Jones, he
[36:04.760 --> 36:10.200]  misrepresented what he put out there. He should have a state bar complaint filed against him.
[36:10.200 --> 36:14.920]  We should also have our congressional officials because of what happened last night and the
[36:14.920 --> 36:20.280]  way they laid things out. This was a Soviet style show trial. This had nothing to do
[36:20.280 --> 36:26.520]  with congressional oversight or investigations. This was mainly to propagandize the public.
[36:26.520 --> 36:32.280]  These people need to be held to account. And I would say at minimum, the penalty should
[36:32.280 --> 36:37.000]  be that they should stop the proceedings and correct the information that they put out
[36:37.000 --> 36:42.720]  last night because it was a fake, a fraud, a lie. And I'll tell you what, people that
[36:42.720 --> 36:47.440]  are pending trial right now like Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs and many, many others, hundreds
[36:47.440 --> 36:54.400]  of others have been so not just disparaged. They've been denied their due process rights.
[36:54.400 --> 36:59.960]  They're prejudicing the jury, tainting the jury with false information. These guys cannot
[36:59.960 --> 37:05.320]  get a fair trial. It doesn't even matter if they request a change of venue. The damage
[37:05.320 --> 37:10.120]  that was caused and that's the blessing in disguise is that these buffoons that go after
[37:10.120 --> 37:16.240]  President Trump at the expense of our Constitution and a lot of great Americans, they need to
[37:16.240 --> 37:21.640]  be held to account. These proceedings need to stop after this first one. And I can present
[37:21.640 --> 37:25.480]  a legal case and I'm not even an attorney. But unfortunately, I've got too much legal
[37:25.480 --> 37:27.200]  experience with them.
[37:27.200 --> 37:33.960]  Well, so do you want to lay that case out now? Because I mean, I'll be honest with you.
[37:33.960 --> 37:40.520]  I mean, I see the positives from last night. The positive I take away is that most people
[37:40.520 --> 37:45.040]  know that's a lie. I mean, most people can still identify a liar when they see one. Most
[37:45.040 --> 37:49.200]  people can still identify a sham, a fraud when they see one. So I believe most people that
[37:49.200 --> 37:53.640]  let's say that tuned in that were neutral to that if that audience existed last night
[37:53.640 --> 37:59.640]  are sitting there saying that's a liar. This is a fraud. This is a sham. But so what? Like
[37:59.640 --> 38:06.000]  you said, the January 6th defendants are now facing what should be mistrials because this
[38:06.000 --> 38:12.280]  is now tainting juries, tainting judges, tainting the whole process. So I mean, if there is
[38:12.280 --> 38:16.720]  a positive, that's the positive I take away from it. But I agree, these things should
[38:16.720 --> 38:19.520]  be stopped immediately. I don't expect them to be.
[38:19.520 --> 38:24.280]  Well, no, they need to be. As a matter of fact, Marcus Childress, I'll call him out.
[38:24.280 --> 38:31.720]  I already have his state bar license numbers right here. I'm going to pursue that he's
[38:31.720 --> 38:36.400]  an attorney. We're not talking about politicians like Liz Cheney. And I'm going to outline
[38:36.400 --> 38:41.880]  what Liz Cheney did that was so egregious that it should cause a mistrial with Ryan
[38:41.880 --> 38:48.000]  Samsell. As a matter of fact, if we could go, if we go to clip number one and maybe
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.640]  go like three quarters of the way in just because it's a longer clip, but three quarters
[38:52.640 --> 38:59.160]  of the way in where that one Capitol police officer, the female was describing what happened
[38:59.160 --> 39:05.320]  to her. Liz Cheney actually played that clip of how she was attacked and she was unconscious
[39:05.320 --> 39:09.360]  and all this stuff. Well, she stopped the clip at the most important moment. And then
[39:09.360 --> 39:14.000]  we'll go to that second clip, but about three quarters of the way through a clip number one,
[39:14.000 --> 39:18.120]  let's take, let's take a look at that and you'll see exactly what I'm referring to.
[39:18.120 --> 39:25.600]  They selectively edited this thing. And it's so egregious. And I mean, so egregious. What
[39:25.600 --> 39:32.640]  she did as she testifies Liz Cheney cuts to this video of Ryan chill, Ryan Samsell, sorry,
[39:32.640 --> 39:38.160]  with the red hat in and on as you recall, he turns his hat backwards and he's grabbing
[39:38.160 --> 39:43.440]  the barricade and she's trying to hold it back. And she and by the way, they don't put
[39:43.440 --> 39:49.200]  Ray Epps in there. Ray Epps was right there. He was never shown last night. He was just
[39:49.200 --> 39:53.080]  very, very briefly. I think so. But here's the most egregious thing that happened. They
[39:53.080 --> 40:00.000]  show Ryan Samsell. She goes back in our heels, right? And essentially what happens, they
[40:00.000 --> 40:06.680]  missed this clip. This is a perfect depiction. She stops the clip at a very, very strategic
[40:06.680 --> 40:13.920]  time. And my second, my second clip that I sent you guys, if you can pull that up, it's
[40:13.920 --> 40:20.600]  a short one. Okay. What she selectively edited. And I know this because I spoke to Ryan Samsell.
[40:20.600 --> 40:25.560]  He literally helped her. He rendered first aid. No, you can see his reaction after she
[40:25.560 --> 40:30.360]  falls down. He grabs his head like, oh, no, oh, no. And then tries to stop her from getting
[40:30.360 --> 40:36.020]  hurt. Yeah, go to, if you can go to clip number three, it shows it right where she, she actually
[40:36.020 --> 40:43.600]  cut it off. And that's, here he is, Ryan Samsell. She, she cut it off at, at this point. And
[40:43.600 --> 40:49.360]  Ryan Samsell actually turns his hat around. She gets pushed back a little bit. And he
[40:49.360 --> 40:53.160]  actually goes around the barricade and renders first aid. And there's Ray Epps right there
[40:53.160 --> 40:58.360]  at the front. There's Ray Epps right there. Okay. I have some breaking news about that
[40:58.360 --> 41:03.880]  as well. And I'm going to do this on info wars exclusively about what's happening at
[41:03.880 --> 41:07.800]  that front barricade. And by the way, let's just analyze this real quick. So because I'm
[41:07.800 --> 41:11.800]  just watching this again with you right now and, and we'll continue the clip and you break
[41:11.800 --> 41:17.200]  it down. But as you can see here, folks, okay, so Samsell is there with his hat on and he
[41:17.200 --> 41:21.920]  actually is not the, he's there. He's in a bad position. He probably would have acted
[41:21.920 --> 41:25.760]  differently in hindsight, but he's there in a bad position. He's standing there and then
[41:25.760 --> 41:31.760]  all of a sudden Ray Epps comes up and then eight guys clad in black start shoving the
[41:31.760 --> 41:37.360]  barricades back into that officer. Who are those? Who are those people clad in black?
[41:37.360 --> 41:43.280]  Liz Cheney stopped the video where that, that Capitol police officer was actually pushed
[41:43.280 --> 41:50.440]  back and she was injured. And she selectively edited it to not show Ryan Sam cell actually
[41:50.440 --> 41:55.800]  assisting and the Capitol police officer actually testified that she was not done conscious.
[41:55.800 --> 42:00.680]  So she doesn't have any recollection of being assisted by the Moga Patriot. There she is
[42:00.680 --> 42:06.800]  falling down and then Ryan Sam cell literally renders first aid by helping her up off the
[42:06.800 --> 42:12.480]  ground. They left that out. That's very egregious, very prejudicial to Ryan Sam cell and guess
[42:12.480 --> 42:16.920]  well, yeah, there's no, there's no counter. There's no counter representative. There's
[42:16.920 --> 42:22.280]  no counter lawyers. It's just all Democrat party propaganda. That's exactly right. Now
[42:22.280 --> 42:29.800]  on the other side of this break that's coming up and I informed Alex that we have whistleblowers
[42:29.800 --> 42:35.280]  internally that we're doing facial recognition at that frontline. The majority of the people
[42:35.280 --> 42:41.920]  at that frontline were quote unquote friendlies and feds and were excluded out. Ray Epps was
[42:41.920 --> 42:46.040]  one of them. And that's why he actually got wiped off the FBI's list when I'll tell you
[42:46.040 --> 42:50.440]  what Pete and we'll also we'll juxtapose that with the video I have that a lot of people
[42:50.440 --> 42:56.040]  have seen and there's more video out there. I got one example of groups clad in black
[42:56.040 --> 43:01.520]  then going into the woods to change into Trump gear. Ladies and gentlemen, high quality

[43:38.760 --> 43:42.800]  have high quality storeable food, water filtration, air filtration and more. And it's not just

[44:08.360 --> 44:13.280]  William in California, people are asleep and program controlled. I agree. How do you make
[44:13.280 --> 44:18.600]  the sleeper awaken William? Hi Alex. Thanks for taking my call. Can I plug Alex real quick?

[44:29.520 --> 44:34.800]  and let me tell you when I don't take it, I pay a price. I really do. I take that B12
[44:34.800 --> 44:40.200]  and I'm electric man. I can run 10 miles. I did some pretty heavy work with a highway

[44:46.120 --> 44:51.600]  you know, pushing 70, and I know I'm not just blowing smoke here. The B12 saves my life.

[47:01.440 --> 47:07.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:17.360 --> 47:23.600]  Back here live on the Alex Jones show with Pete Santillio and Troyer filling in. One
[47:23.600 --> 47:30.160]  of the individuals involved in the impeachment shams, remember they did the Russia hoax sham,
[47:30.160 --> 47:34.280]  they did the impeachment shams, all to get Donald Trump. Daniel Goldman says, we may
[47:34.280 --> 47:40.280]  be watching chilling video and wrenching testimony, but Donald Trump should be seeing handcuffs.
[47:40.280 --> 47:47.080]  No, these liars, the only crooks involved in this thing are all the people sitting on
[47:47.080 --> 47:51.560]  the panel. And then I can't believe they get anybody to go along and lie with them. I mean,
[47:51.560 --> 47:55.560]  this is one of the biggest mysteries of how they get so many people to lie with them.
[47:55.560 --> 47:59.360]  Do they really hate America that much? Do they really hate Donald Trump that much? Clearly
[47:59.360 --> 48:03.240]  they're afraid of Donald Trump to run all these shams, to try to destroy him around
[48:03.240 --> 48:08.520]  the clock, but Pete, it doesn't stop there. They've got lawyers trying to frame innocent
[48:08.520 --> 48:11.480]  people with this deal and you've got them.
[48:11.480 --> 48:15.880]  Absolutely. And we're going to get to that in a second here and I'm going to kind of
[48:15.880 --> 48:21.080]  lead the way here. But first, I want everybody to recognize that what they did to Staff Sergeant
[48:21.080 --> 48:29.840]  Joe Biggs, because of his status as a double purple heart combat veteran, served honorably,
[48:29.840 --> 48:35.280]  got out medically discharged. He's actually being held pre-trial, okay? And he's presumed
[48:35.280 --> 48:39.880]  innocent, but they used his name as if he led the entire thing.
[48:39.880 --> 48:44.860]  But they're of course going to go after him. You see, they're going to pursue President
[48:44.860 --> 48:52.200]  Trump at the expense of the likes of Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, of course. Enrique Terry,
[48:52.200 --> 48:56.760]  all of them being held pre-trial, all of their names being disparaged. They want to go after
[48:56.760 --> 48:58.640]  Trump, but it's at the expense of our Constitution.
[48:58.640 --> 49:02.440]  Yeah, and let me just kind of rephrase that, Pete, too, because this is such a key point
[49:02.440 --> 49:08.520]  and this is why these people are so dangerous. Folks, they don't care. Collateral damage means
[49:08.520 --> 49:13.480]  nothing to them. They don't care who gets killed. They don't care whose lives are destroyed.
[49:13.480 --> 49:18.160]  They don't care if the entire civilization collapses for their agenda. Literally, collateral
[49:18.160 --> 49:21.720]  damage is nothing to these people. They want to get Trump. They want to destroy our freedoms
[49:21.720 --> 49:25.480]  in this country. All the lives and culture and civilization that gets destroyed in the
[49:25.480 --> 49:28.520]  process, they don't care.
[49:28.520 --> 49:35.000]  That's right. That's absolutely right now. I'm going to say this loud and clear on infowars.com.
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.320]  There's no doubt about it. Our elected officials must step forward because of what happened
[49:39.320 --> 49:44.200]  last night. Isn't just some political game. We're talking about lives at stake here.
[49:44.200 --> 49:50.880]  We have Americans sitting in the gulag in D.C. pre-trial. The presumption of innocence
[49:50.880 --> 49:56.120]  is destroyed and the information that's being put out there is to deceive the public. It
[49:56.120 --> 50:02.080]  was a Soviet show trial. None of that information would have ever withstood the scrutiny in
[50:02.080 --> 50:03.080]  a court of law.
[50:03.080 --> 50:08.160]  I'm going to give you an example. This is a bombshell. It's never before been seen
[50:08.160 --> 50:14.120]  until last night, of course. But this Marcus Childress, he's not a politician. He's a licensed
[50:14.120 --> 50:19.280]  attorney. I have all of his five licenses. He's licensed in many different areas that
[50:19.280 --> 50:24.120]  we're going to obviously pursue him and file complaints the appropriate people should.
[50:24.120 --> 50:29.280]  Alex Jones for one. I want to play this clip that's on, I just published it on a rumble
[50:29.280 --> 50:36.840]  channel. We're going to broadcast it exclusively here. This attorney framed Alex Jones just
[50:36.840 --> 50:41.720]  a short segment during that hearing yesterday and Stuart Rhodes as well. Stuart Rhodes
[50:41.720 --> 50:46.040]  and Alex Jones were framed by an attorney. These attorneys know better. What was done
[50:46.040 --> 50:49.560]  was egregious. Let's go to that right now. It's a short clip, but it's powerful.
[50:49.560 --> 50:54.400]  December 19th, President Trump tweeted about the January 6th rally and told attendees,
[50:54.400 --> 50:59.800]  be there, we'll be wild. Many of the witnesses that we interviewed were inspired by the president's
[50:59.800 --> 51:05.440]  call and came to D.C. for January 6th. But the extremists, they took it a step further.
[51:05.440 --> 51:10.120]  They viewed this tweet as a call to arms. A day later, the Department of Justice describes
[51:10.120 --> 51:15.040]  how the Proud Boys created a chat called the Ministry of Self-Defense Leadership Chat.
[51:15.040 --> 51:19.480]  In this chat, the Proud Boys established a command structure in anticipation of coming
[51:19.480 --> 51:24.240]  back to D.C. on January 6th. The Department of Justice describes Mr. Tarrio coming into
[51:24.240 --> 51:31.040]  possession of a document called the 1776 Returns, which describes individuals occupying key
[51:31.040 --> 51:35.440]  buildings around the United States Capitol. The Oathkeepers are another group that the
[51:35.440 --> 51:55.680]  committee investigated. The committee learned that the Oathkeepers set up quick reaction
[51:55.680 --> 52:01.760]  forces outside of the city in Virginia where they stored arms. The goal of these quick
[52:01.760 --> 52:04.920]  reaction forces was to be on standby just in case President Trump invoked the Interaction
[52:04.920 --> 52:07.920]  Act. Did the Oathkeepers ever provide weapons to
[52:07.920 --> 52:14.560]  members? I'm going to climb to answer that with them with browns for a due process grounds.
[52:14.560 --> 52:19.720]  On December 19th, President Trump tweeted about the January 6th rally and told attendees,
[52:19.720 --> 52:23.280]  be there, we'll be wild. But the extremists, they took it a step further.
[52:23.280 --> 52:30.520]  Let's stop it right there. Here it is. This attorney, he just, he laid it out at the beginning.
[52:30.520 --> 52:36.040]  I actually just repeated it to tail into my video. He said December 19th, President Trump
[52:36.040 --> 52:44.040]  sent out a tweet and incited people. And it was a call to arms. And then he cut to Alex
[52:44.040 --> 52:52.480]  Jones on November 10th. How can Alex Jones be incited? How was there a call to arms based
[52:52.480 --> 52:57.960]  on a tweet that was sent out December 19th? And then jumbling all that together and associating
[52:57.960 --> 53:04.040]  it with guns, of course, the QRF. Well, I'll tell you what, the Oathkeepers and the probs
[53:04.040 --> 53:10.640]  was that anybody that went to D.C. with firearms, which they're legally allowed to do so, didn't
[53:10.640 --> 53:15.920]  take them into D.C. because it was illegal. They stored them where it was legally appropriate.
[53:15.920 --> 53:19.360]  Yeah, another big lie. They say, oh, arm protesters, they didn't have a single arm
[53:19.360 --> 53:26.160]  protester there. That's right. Now, here's another most egregious thing. Stuart Rhodes
[53:26.160 --> 53:32.080]  gave testimony voluntarily. I guess he just stepped forward and gave testimony, but he
[53:32.080 --> 53:38.000]  asserted his fifth amendment rights. What did they do with that information? They presented
[53:38.000 --> 53:43.760]  it in the show trial to create the impression that he's guilty and then show guns and show
[53:43.760 --> 53:51.120]  Alex Jones jumbling all of that together, not by politician and attorney. Let me just interject
[53:51.120 --> 53:58.080]  something too here, Pete, because there's a full spectrum here as well. I believe that
[53:58.080 --> 54:04.640]  at the very outset of this, and I hope Republicans investigate this, and Democrats, if they lie
[54:04.640 --> 54:09.880]  under oath, then they should be held accountable. But I believe right at the outset of this,
[54:09.880 --> 54:15.200]  they planned on making this a big Hollywood production right out of the gates. And they
[54:15.200 --> 54:20.160]  knew we need to start compiling, we need to start compiling everything we can. Let's
[54:20.160 --> 54:24.840]  get as many people deposed as possible so they have thousands of hours of deposition
[54:24.840 --> 54:29.880]  that they can boil down to 10 minutes and cherry pick to get the appearance that they
[54:29.880 --> 54:34.800]  want. Same thing with getting thousands of emails, thousands of text messages from all
[54:34.800 --> 54:38.960]  these people. Cherry pick it so they can have the exact presentation they want. It took
[54:38.960 --> 54:43.240]  them a year and a half to do it. Now they have it all. They're doing their little presentation.
[54:43.240 --> 54:49.160]  They're showing you 1% or less of what they got. It's the 1% that they can use against
[54:49.160 --> 54:53.680]  their political opposition. This is all a big Hollywood production.
[54:53.680 --> 54:58.040]  I'm not going to talk about your case specifically. He was an American, let's say, because of
[54:58.040 --> 55:01.880]  your circumstances. That's all I'll say about your case, because I understand and respect
[55:01.880 --> 55:08.240]  why you need to remain silent in that regard. You found out last night, formally and officially,
[55:08.240 --> 55:13.320]  that the US government knew well in advance through intelligence. Cheney said that they
[55:13.320 --> 55:16.920]  knew that there was going to be an insurrection. They knew there was going to be violence.
[55:16.920 --> 55:21.720]  They knew that all this stuff was supposed to happen. It was all preplanned. It was all
[55:21.720 --> 55:28.160]  done by President Trump and his co-conspirators to insurect. But they had one person standing
[55:28.160 --> 55:33.960]  there at the front face of the people coming up to the Capitol. The doors were left open.
[55:33.960 --> 55:39.520]  They were totally understaffed. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer basically denied President
[55:39.520 --> 55:43.960]  Trump's request for National Guard. Are you upset that they knew that there was going
[55:43.960 --> 55:49.120]  to be violence? There was going to be chaos? They knew so well in advance and did not provide
[55:49.120 --> 55:54.600]  you as a peaceful person that was assembling there and acting as a journalist? Aren't you
[55:54.600 --> 55:58.080]  upset that there wasn't enough adequate security knowing what they knew?
[55:58.080 --> 56:04.440]  Absolutely. I am furious that the Democrats stood down for security that day.
[56:04.440 --> 56:08.960]  All of these defendants were put in circumstances where they're emotionally charged because
[56:08.960 --> 56:13.840]  they love their country. They thought that, well, everyone went there to redress grievance,
[56:13.840 --> 56:18.800]  to stand peaceably. And there were provocateurs internally. And I'm just going to end on this
[56:18.800 --> 56:24.280]  note. Are you upset right now that there are whistleblowers internally in a small group
[56:24.280 --> 56:31.480]  that have identified with facial recognition, including Ray Epps, that that's why he was
[56:31.480 --> 56:36.840]  removed? He was a friendly. That the majority of the people at the frontline of that initial
[56:36.840 --> 56:41.880]  breach were all feds. Are you upset right now that that information is not being revealed?
[56:41.880 --> 56:46.600]  That the videotapes are not being revealed because it'll reveal through facial recognition
[56:46.600 --> 56:52.600]  who the feds were that were mingling inside and outside the Capitol? America should be
[56:52.600 --> 56:58.680]  upset by that. That it was federal agents put in the crowd and inside the Capitol that
[56:58.680 --> 57:04.680]  provoked the whole thing. And we've got citizens like Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs. I'm singling
[57:04.680 --> 57:08.840]  him out because of what they did to him last night was so egregious. Sitting there pending
[57:08.840 --> 57:15.240]  trial while Liz Cheney used the U.S. Congress for political purposes.
[57:15.240 --> 57:24.280]  Yeah. Let me put it this way. I am extremely upset that this entire January 6th day now
[57:24.280 --> 57:31.560]  seems to be like it was an entrapment from the very beginning. Alaw, Michigan, FBI, Governor
[57:31.560 --> 57:36.160]  Whitmer kidnapping. It seems that they were running the exact same entrapment technique
[57:36.160 --> 57:41.800]  on January 6th in Washington, D.C. And guess what? It was the same FBI leader that ran
[57:41.800 --> 57:49.400]  the fake kidnapping of Whitmer that was leading the charge on January 6th, folks.
[57:49.400 --> 57:54.320]  A lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find out of the thousands of great items
[57:54.320 --> 57:58.920]  at m4store.com, all the storeable food. So we've made it easy with our great partners

[58:14.040 --> 58:18.320]  I told you over two years ago the global is going to have massive inflation and food
[58:18.320 --> 58:23.120]  shortages and it's happened just like clockwork. And I'm telling you it's going to get a lot
[58:23.120 --> 58:28.680]  worse. They have designed this. The way to beat them is to buy food now before your dollar
[58:28.680 --> 58:35.080]  is even more devalued. We are ready to ship to you right now at preparetoday.com and not

[58:49.400 --> 58:52.920]  It's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when the internet
[58:52.920 --> 58:57.360]  and mobile technology first came out, which is we thought this is going to level the playing
[58:57.360 --> 59:00.240]  field. Everybody is going to have access to the same information and everybody is going
[59:00.240 --> 59:06.160]  to be able to freely communicate that information. That's our goal, to get back to that place
[59:06.160 --> 59:11.320]  where we all have access to all of the information. We all have the ability to freely communicate
[59:11.320 --> 59:17.480]  that information with whomever we want, whenever we want and we don't have to worry about anybody
[59:17.480 --> 59:23.080]  tracking what we're doing and trying to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way
[59:23.080 --> 59:28.200]  to go after us because of the conversations we're having, because of the internet searches
[59:28.200 --> 59:32.880]  that we're doing, because of the discussions, the people we want to talk to about these
[59:32.880 --> 59:38.000]  things. That's our goal, is to help people take back their freedom by helping them take
[59:38.000 --> 59:44.000]  back their privacy. That's really what we're trying to do. I hope that everybody listening
[59:44.000 --> 1:00:11.800]  will be able to hear us. We'll check us out at boltowireless.com. That's B-O-L-T-A-Wireless.com.
[1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:17.280]  You know, there's another angle to this, Pete, that really shows how desperate the Democrats
[1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:24.320]  are. It's like a rabid raccoon or something that's cornered and is just gnashing and
[1:00:24.320 --> 1:00:29.960]  slashing violently. That shows that they're panicked because they know they're the bad
[1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:36.000]  guy, know that in a legitimate circumstance that they are not going to be victorious.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:40.200]  That's why they had to run all their marketing. Now, I didn't take the time to print the thousands
[1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:44.560]  of different tweets, but I wonder if they weren't paying people even to market this
[1:00:44.560 --> 1:00:50.480]  event. Anna Navarro marketing it, Mark Hamill marketing it. He's always got his popcorn.
[1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:54.120]  You think he voluntarily did that? Or do you think someone encouraged him to do that? Michelle
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:59.920]  Obama, Hillary Clinton, all other Hollywood actors, Hollywood liberals, mainstream media.
[1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:06.760]  I mean, that guy's roll clip, roll the clip that shows all the different news networks
[1:01:06.760 --> 1:01:11.120]  versus Fox News. I guess that's clip eight guys. Put that on the screen right now. So
[1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:16.600]  I mean, they did a massive marketing push for this. Any cable news station last night
[1:01:16.600 --> 1:01:21.200]  that does live news coverage in the evening, covered it live, except Fox News kept their
[1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:25.080]  host on and they kind of went in and out of it. Every other one did it. Okay, now let's
[1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:31.840]  do 2000 mules. How about that, Pete? How about now we air 2000 mules on every news network,
[1:01:31.840 --> 1:01:35.800]  cable news network on prime time and let's have everybody market that to the public
[1:01:35.800 --> 1:01:40.760]  too. So I mean, again, if we want to talk positives here, which it's hard to do, but
[1:01:40.760 --> 1:01:44.560]  we need to do it. I mean, it really shows how desperate they are that they had to beg
[1:01:44.560 --> 1:01:49.440]  and plead for everybody to watch their sham hearing last night. And I haven't seen the
[1:01:49.440 --> 1:01:54.680]  ratings numbers yet, but my guess is the ratings were not good.
[1:01:54.680 --> 1:02:02.080]  You know, we had more people on our getter's feed than CNN did on their, their Facebook
[1:02:02.080 --> 1:02:08.000]  feed. That should tell you a lot. And we have a small show. But you know, the positive side
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  of things, let's, let's go at it at the jugular. Marjorie Taylor Green, she was at the podium
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:16.920]  before the hearings. She was calling out the fact that the video hasn't been released.
[1:02:16.920 --> 1:02:22.080]  You know, we need, we need all hands on deck from our God's ultra mug of Patriots will
[1:02:22.080 --> 1:02:27.440]  step forward and say, these proceedings need to stop. Here's the positive thing. It was
[1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:34.240]  so legally egregious. You can't put together in a court of law montages and say Joe Biggs
[1:02:34.240 --> 1:02:39.840]  and then show nooses and then mentioned President Trump's tweet, you know, December 19th and
[1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:42.880]  then cut to Alex Jones on November 10th.
[1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:47.960]  You cannot do that in a court of law. You can't build these montages, have them out of context
[1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:53.320]  for the purposes of persuading the jury with lies. So therefore, these proceedings, which
[1:02:53.320 --> 1:02:57.240]  are intended to deceive the public because they flat out told lies and we can prove it
[1:02:57.240 --> 1:02:58.240]  legally.
[1:02:58.240 --> 1:03:04.240]  The Republican officials need to step forward and say pause on these proceedings. We need
[1:03:04.240 --> 1:03:08.320]  to, we need to verify this information you're putting out. You're deceiving the public. Stop
[1:03:08.320 --> 1:03:14.560]  that. Next thing, Owen, you have a case right now. Info wars was so disparage that they're
[1:03:14.560 --> 1:03:20.920]  literally, I'm calling it a framing of Alex Jones and Stuart Rhodes. You need to file
[1:03:20.920 --> 1:03:24.880]  state bar complaints against that attorney that did that. You know why? Because he knows
[1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:28.960]  better. File a state bar complaint against these attorneys for knowing what they did
[1:03:28.960 --> 1:03:30.560]  was absolutely wrong.
[1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:37.560]  File a complaint against Liz Cheney for stepping outside of the bounds of appropriate decorum
[1:03:37.560 --> 1:03:43.280]  and ethics to edit a video selectively, not show Ryan Samsell rendering first aid to the
[1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:48.920]  Capitol Police. What is that to do? That's to deceive the public, to paint a narrative,
[1:03:48.920 --> 1:03:49.920]  to brainwash us.
[1:03:49.920 --> 1:03:54.000]  On the other side of the break, let's talk about how patient they are. They'll work with
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:01.080]  a potential active shooter like the Buffalo shooter for two years in a 4chan chat thread
[1:04:01.080 --> 1:04:07.600]  to get him to be a willing shooter at the local black American grocery store. Of course,
[1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:12.960]  these are very patient people that not only script things and script their narratives,
[1:04:12.960 --> 1:04:17.040]  they have to put all their stuff on the teleprompter to make sure they're lining up their lives
[1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:22.360]  so that nobody really can tell the difference. But we caught them. We caught them yesterday.
[1:04:22.360 --> 1:04:27.440]  That's the positive side of it. Oh, and we caught them in the first day of their hearings.
[1:04:27.440 --> 1:04:34.000]  Now let's take action. Yeah, and holding action exactly. And you know, Republicans,
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:39.160]  and this might be too little too late, but it's an idea. Maybe it, maybe it could desire
[1:04:39.160 --> 1:04:43.680]  some application here, but hey, let's do hearings. Let's call up the police from New York that
[1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:47.520]  were hospitalized by Democrat riots in 2020. Let's call the police in Chicago that were
[1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:52.640]  hospitalized by Democrat riots, the police in Los Angeles, the victims of the families
[1:04:52.640 --> 1:04:56.200]  of the dead police. Let's call them for hearings about the Democrat riots. Let's get one of
[1:04:56.200 --> 1:04:57.200]  those going.
[1:04:57.200 --> 1:05:04.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, high quality, storeable food is back in stock, ready to ship right
[1:05:04.760 --> 1:05:09.280]  now. We've not been selling food for three months because it was taking several weeks
[1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:12.880]  for the food to get packaged and delivered to you. Most other companies are completely
[1:05:12.880 --> 1:05:18.200]  out, but now they have a large spectrum of high quality food, ready to ship. Everything
[1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:25.240]  you find at preparewithallux.com or preparetoday.com is in stock, ready to ship. So go to preparewithallux.com
[1:05:25.240 --> 1:05:29.840]  or preparetoday.com and order your high quality, storeable food right now, ready to ship to
[1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:34.240]  you and your family with the inflation happening, with the food shortages, with the wars, with
[1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:38.080]  the collapse and wars, everything's happening is one of the most important as you can make
[1:05:38.080 --> 1:05:42.080]  is to have high quality, storeable food, water filtration, air filtration and more. And it's
[1:05:42.080 --> 1:05:46.080]  not just those items, it's hundreds of other high quality preparedness items and survival
[1:05:46.080 --> 1:05:52.920]  items right now at preparewithallux.com that again redirects to preparetoday.com. I would
[1:05:52.920 --> 1:05:55.840]  not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important things you can do is
[1:05:55.840 --> 1:06:05.440]  get ahead of inflation now because the inflation is just beginning.
[1:06:05.440 --> 1:06:19.320]  You know, it all makes sense now. This is just a big Hollywood production. That's why
[1:06:19.320 --> 1:06:23.400]  they've been marketing it for the last year and a half to keep it in your consciousness
[1:06:23.400 --> 1:06:28.200]  because they knew they were going to eventually release their big movie, a.k.a. these January
[1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:33.000]  6 hearings. So I mean, yeah, let's why not bring up the summer of 2020 riots? Why not?
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:38.160]  I mean, let's bring them up. We should seriously, I mean, Democrats want to act like they're
[1:06:38.160 --> 1:06:42.880]  the party of peace. I played the compilation earlier on the transmission. I mean, you
[1:06:42.880 --> 1:06:47.400]  could play compilations for hours of Democrats calling for violence. I mean, directly calling
[1:06:47.400 --> 1:06:52.760]  for violence and then they attempt to assassinate dozens of politicians at a baseball practice
[1:06:52.760 --> 1:06:57.160]  in D.C. They go out in front of Supreme Court justices to attempt assassination. They kill
[1:06:57.160 --> 1:07:00.360]  a Trump supporter in Portland. They kill a Trump supporter in Denver. They kill a Trump
[1:07:00.360 --> 1:07:05.160]  supporter in D.C. Five of them actually on January 6. I mean, let's have hearings. Democrats
[1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:09.600]  want to play hearing games. Let's go Republicans step up to the plate. Let's let's let's put
[1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:14.200]  all the facts out there. Let's show the world who the true evil party is. That's an easy
[1:07:14.200 --> 1:07:20.200]  victory for Republicans. I mean, the Democrats give us thousands of times the ammunition
[1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:27.320]  that the Democrats have one day, one day in the history of this country, one out of thousands
[1:07:27.320 --> 1:07:34.640]  of Republican events that got out of hand. One, one, we've got dozens, hundreds, thousands
[1:07:34.640 --> 1:07:38.520]  of Democrat events that get underhand. We know that it's the weather underground that
[1:07:38.520 --> 1:07:44.120]  influenced Barack Obama, Kathy Baudin, Chesa Baudin. I mean, it's got a history of domestic
[1:07:44.120 --> 1:07:48.600]  terrorism. I mean, I can go on and on and I'd rather not play these games. I'd rather
[1:07:48.600 --> 1:07:53.840]  just the country look at these corrupt Democrats and just say, Hey, you know what, you're done.
[1:07:53.840 --> 1:07:59.880]  Stop your sham hearings. I'm not going to accept the and I understand what you're saying.
[1:07:59.880 --> 1:08:05.040]  It's one day compared to what they do and the impact of what they do and the damage they
[1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:09.200]  cause during your riots. I'm not going to accept the accepted for the following reason
[1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:15.280]  that it was one day that some people made mistakes because they are withholding information.
[1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:19.760]  We have whistleblowers internally that are afraid to come forward. The attorneys need
[1:08:19.760 --> 1:08:27.200]  to request the facial recognition programs that identified Ray Epps and that's how they
[1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:32.560]  determined to take Ray Epps off of the list of people to target for indictment, as well
[1:08:32.560 --> 1:08:38.240]  as the hundreds of federal agents who were in the crowd. The majority of the frontline
[1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:42.560]  and the breeds were federal agents. So I'm not going to accept that the chaos was something
[1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:47.840]  that spontaneously occurred because of emotion. I'm going to say that it was provocative toward
[1:08:47.840 --> 1:08:53.280]  by federal agents. They needed that scenario because they reverse engineer indictment.
[1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:58.680]  They needed an insurrection because we were gathered together peaceably and we generally
[1:08:58.680 --> 1:09:04.920]  are peaceable. So Owen, I want to know what did they find out with the facial recognition
[1:09:04.920 --> 1:09:09.000]  software? How many friendlies were there? There are people internally that are whistleblowers
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:13.320]  that want to come forward, but they're afraid to do that. Here's the next thing, Owen. You
[1:09:13.320 --> 1:09:18.280]  could have Liz Cheney play political games and Shifty Schiff and say, well, we can get
[1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:23.760]  away with this stuff. We're not non attorneys and we're just congressional political hacks.
[1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:31.120]  But look at this guy right here. See this guy? Marcus Tildris is a licensed attorney who
[1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:38.840]  was investigative counsel for the US House of Representatives. What he did was so egregious.
[1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:43.240]  He knows better as an attorney. He could actually have his bar license removed because he's
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:48.080]  not Liz Cheney, the political act. He's actually an attorney that knows better than to do what
[1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:54.720]  he did legally to Alex Jones and to Stuart Rhodes by essentially framing them and attaching
[1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:58.640]  them to something derogatory that they should have never been associated with.
[1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:05.280]  Well, I don't know, Pete. We've got a real powerful testimony here from a J6 witness
[1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:10.040]  in clip nine. Apparently in the middle of the most violent insurrection of all time,
[1:10:10.040 --> 1:10:14.760]  folks, listen to what the J6 witness in clip nine has to say.
[1:10:14.760 --> 1:10:20.840]  Well, no, first of all, we went round to the back and down the steps and we took some photographs
[1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:26.600]  on the east side of the Capitol. And then we went for lunch. We went for tacos.
[1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:32.720]  They went for tacos, Pete. And by the way, that was the documentary filmmaker who was
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:38.160]  filming the Proud Boys that day. He was called to the stand as a witness in the middle of
[1:10:38.160 --> 1:10:42.760]  the violent insurrection, the planned insurrection. They just said, Hey, guys, want to get some
[1:10:42.760 --> 1:10:49.200]  tacos? You know, in the Bundy cases, do you know what broke the case open? Because they
[1:10:49.200 --> 1:10:54.600]  had a quote unquote documentary filmmaker organization. It was actually the FBI. They
[1:10:54.600 --> 1:11:00.520]  had a $500,000 Mercedes, Mercedes Sprinter. They had this huge team of people they had
[1:11:00.520 --> 1:11:05.000]  been pretended. They were documentary filmmakers. And they did so for the purposes of getting
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:11.200]  everybody on record. Six months after Bundy Ranch, they got them drunk and had them make
[1:11:11.200 --> 1:11:17.560]  certain admissions on on film, right? And they presented that that video to the jury.
[1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:21.680]  Well, guess what? Right in the middle of the trial, we found out that it was actually done
[1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:27.280]  by the FBI and it was busted wide open and their entire case unraveled and the jury was
[1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:33.680]  disgusted by it. So I want to ask that documentary filmmaker with the British accent, sir, are
[1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:40.080]  you working for British intelligence? A, B, are you getting paid by the FBI or the CIA?
[1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:46.560]  Are we asking any questions whatsoever to cross examine everything they're putting out there?
[1:11:46.560 --> 1:11:50.500]  Absolutely not. But guess what? I believe the American public deserves to have the answers
[1:11:50.500 --> 1:11:55.360]  to these questions and especially those that are waiting trial. Don't you agree, Owen, that
[1:11:55.360 --> 1:12:00.440]  we have to have answers to the question? Oh, absolutely. I mean, I mean, you can't have
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:04.840]  any because let's be honest, they want to they want to perpetuate this as a legal proceeding.
[1:12:04.840 --> 1:12:09.160]  It's obviously not. If it were a legal proceeding or a legitimate hearing, you'd have you'd
[1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:15.080]  have counterpoints. You'd have counter witnesses, counter evidence, counter lawyers. You don't
[1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:20.520]  have any counter. It's just all totally controlled. But I mean, come on, Pete. I mean, you know,
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:24.600]  they claim that this violent insurrection, this coup, they tall was being planned for
[1:12:24.600 --> 1:12:29.200]  months and everything. Let's just go get tacos. Guy asked me about all of our planning. Let's
[1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:33.000]  just go get some tacos. And by the way, I agree with what you said at the beginning of
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:37.680]  the segment. And let's just show them more evidence of this. And this is just one example.
[1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:41.280]  There's other videos out there. I just wanted to present at least one today for the sake
[1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:45.400]  of time, guys. Just go ahead and give me the B roll of clip 14. This is what we were mentioning
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:50.480]  earlier, guys. Go ahead and B roll me clip 14. This is what you would guess are Antifa
[1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:56.160]  members after they after they break the barriers and after they break through the Capitol, they
[1:12:56.160 --> 1:13:01.360]  then go out into the woods and change into their Trump gear. They go out and change into
[1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:04.560]  their Trump gear. And by the way, this isn't the only example. There were others that were
[1:13:04.560 --> 1:13:08.880]  actually inside with backpacks clad in black that broke windows and then went inside and
[1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:13.000]  put on a Trump hat. So there's all kinds of evidence. Oh, look, these guys clad in black
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:16.560]  covering their faces, broke the barriers, broke into the Capitol. And now all of a sudden
[1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:20.400]  they have Trump gear on. I mean, how is this not presented out there?
[1:13:20.400 --> 1:13:26.400]  Yeah. And then, of course, they roll this clip here and they say, oh, here comes Joe
[1:13:26.400 --> 1:13:31.160]  Biggs, right after they just disparage. Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs is awaiting trial. He's
[1:13:31.160 --> 1:13:36.320]  presumed innocent, but they're attaching him to say that he led 1.5 million people through
[1:13:36.320 --> 1:13:40.200]  this window and they put his name across the bottom. You think he's going to get a fair
[1:13:40.200 --> 1:13:45.360]  trial? You think he's going to find a jury anywhere in America that saw this thing to
[1:13:45.360 --> 1:13:51.920]  think that Joe Biggs is innocent? And here's a legitimate question and I genuinely don't
[1:13:51.920 --> 1:13:57.080]  know the answer. My guess is no. Have any of those individuals that broke into the Capitol
[1:13:57.080 --> 1:14:01.240]  that we just saw in that film that were all clad in black, classic antifa wear, have any
[1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:06.320]  of them been ID'd and or arrested? Do you know of it? To my knowledge, the answer is
[1:14:06.320 --> 1:14:11.760]  no. This is what I do know. The reason why the video has not been released is because
[1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:17.560]  there's been a lot of people ID'd and the majority of them, a lot of them are feds.
[1:14:17.560 --> 1:14:22.080]  They don't want to reveal that to the public. Marjorie Taylor Green pointed that out yesterday
[1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:26.080]  at the podium on the floor of Congress. Why are you not releasing those videos? Well, I'm
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:31.560]  going to tell you that we had a whistleblower come forward, leak information through proper
[1:14:31.560 --> 1:14:37.280]  channels because they're desperate to get somebody to request all the data that they've
[1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:44.200]  identified hundreds of federal agents. I know one of them that was out on the lawn outside
[1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:49.760]  the Capitol that was removing all of the barricades that said restricted area. How many people
[1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:56.160]  got charged with entering a restricted area? Well, that restricted area was made available
[1:14:56.160 --> 1:15:01.000]  thanks to the good graces of somebody working for the Joint Terrorism Task Force. And by
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:09.920]  the way, any other circumstance, any other circumstance, if you're going to try to charge
[1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:14.900]  someone with trespassing, but you, the defendant, let's say you're a defendant, you get charged
[1:15:14.900 --> 1:15:18.880]  with trespassing and you, the defendant, you have evidence that shows you were invited
[1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:23.880]  into the building. Guess what? Trust passing charges dropped, trial thrown out. There's
[1:15:23.880 --> 1:15:29.000]  video of the police inviting them in. There's videos of police removing the barricades.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:33.640]  Now our trespassing charges not dropped, even for those that weren't even trespassing,
[1:15:33.640 --> 1:15:40.080]  like I don't know, maybe me. Yeah, but of course they say that everyone, 1.5 million
[1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:44.760]  of us, had the intent to go there and stop a congressional proceeding. I don't know
[1:15:44.760 --> 1:15:48.600]  where that came from. That's like, oh, here's Donald Trump calling for peace. Here's Alex
[1:15:48.600 --> 1:15:53.480]  Jones calling for peace. Oh, there to blame. Here's Ray Epps calling for violence. No,
[1:15:53.480 --> 1:15:58.600]  no interest in Ray Epps though. Let's play that clip when we come back with Pete Santilli.
[1:15:58.600 --> 1:16:04.600]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right. People ask,
[1:16:04.600 --> 1:16:08.800]  what's it like to be vindicated? Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew
[1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:14.720]  this was coming. I tried to stop it and now everything I've talked about is going to become
[1:16:14.720 --> 1:16:20.880]  more important than ever because the globalist aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and
[1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:27.520]  documents. It's now out in the open. Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth.
[1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:33.040]  The Bilderberg group founded Davos group. So now the fight's out in the open. They're
[1:16:33.040 --> 1:16:37.240]  making their move because they know they're behind schedule. We're going to win this thing.
[1:16:37.240 --> 1:16:40.800]  God's watching the children counting on us. I just want to thank the viewers and listeners
[1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:45.200]  for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you,
[1:16:45.200 --> 1:16:48.800]  info wars would not be here. I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are
[1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:53.560]  the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance. So I want to thank
[1:16:53.560 --> 1:16:58.560]  you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:03.360]  Every single person listening to the sound of my voice needs to listen to me very, very
[1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:11.440]  carefully. The Nestos is made the most important documentary in the US history. 2000 mules.

[1:19:04.320 --> 1:19:10.160]  one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the censors has been patriot,
[1:19:10.160 --> 1:19:14.120]  apparel, so we can identify each other so we can spread the word and so we can push
[1:19:14.120 --> 1:19:18.960]  people to websites like infowars.com so they can understand the globalist plan and how
[1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:22.320]  to stop it. Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out
[1:19:22.320 --> 1:19:26.880]  of all of our designs of t-shirts, some of which go back more than 25 years. All these

[1:19:36.040 --> 1:19:39.680]  left. In a couple of weeks, they'll all be gone and they'll be history. We're selling

[1:19:59.520 --> 1:20:21.400]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:21.400 --> 1:20:25.520]  Remember when a Democrat showed up in a Republican baseball practice to attempt a mass murder?
[1:20:25.520 --> 1:20:32.760]  No hearings. Remember when a Democrat mowed over almost 100 people at a Christmas parade?
[1:20:32.760 --> 1:20:38.080]  No hearings. Remember when a Democrat went to assassinate Brett Kavanaugh? No hearings.
[1:20:38.080 --> 1:20:42.080]  Remember when Democrats burned American cities for an entire summer straight, $2 billion property
[1:20:42.080 --> 1:20:47.400]  damage, thousands of injuries, thousands of police hospitalizations, dozens of murders.
[1:20:47.400 --> 1:20:52.720]  Some businesses never reopened. Any hearings? No. No, but the political stuntry of the
[1:20:52.720 --> 1:20:56.720]  Democrat party continues. It's the most corrupt party in this nation's history, folks. This
[1:20:56.720 --> 1:21:01.960]  country can never get to the next level until the Democrats are completely done, completely
[1:21:01.960 --> 1:21:08.960]  eradicated politically from this country. Here's the video of Ray Epps that still many
[1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:13.720]  questions remain and many may be answered in the next segment when we're joined by Dr.
[1:21:13.720 --> 1:21:17.880]  Jaren Beatty, Pete Santilli still with us. Here's the video of Ray Epps that they made
[1:21:17.880 --> 1:21:24.880]  sure did not make the air last night and they don't want you to see in clip 4.
[1:05:00.860 --> 1:22:03.880]  Now here is January 6th. The other footage was January 5th the night before
[1:22:03.880 --> 1:22:07.880]  now January 6th doing the same thing. Ray Epps calling for people to go in.
[1:22:07.880 --> 1:22:23.440]  Now before the breach of the grounds here's Ray Epps again. Right at the barrier as it's
[1:22:23.440 --> 1:22:32.320]  being breached. And then you have a bunch of guys clad in black who were the first guys
[1:22:32.320 --> 1:22:38.160]  to go into the Capitol. A bunch of guys clad in black. Still not identified. And then there
[1:22:38.160 --> 1:22:53.960]  goes Ray Epps. So to my knowledge and I would imagine they'd show us any other evidence
[1:22:53.960 --> 1:23:00.440]  if it existed of individuals encouraging people to engage in violence or encouraging
[1:23:00.440 --> 1:23:05.000]  people to break into the Capitol or encouraging people to go over the barricades that was
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:10.560]  Ray Epps and that's John Sullivan. I've yet to see any other evidence of people encouraging
[1:23:10.560 --> 1:23:16.840]  that except those two. Neither one is currently in jail. John Sullivan is in a legal battle.
[1:23:16.840 --> 1:23:23.040]  My guess is he'll probably fare just fine in that. And then Ray Epps no charges, no arrests,
[1:23:23.040 --> 1:23:27.240]  you know not even brought up in the hearing. It's just amazing stuff. Pete we've got you
[1:23:27.240 --> 1:23:31.360]  here for five more minutes before Darren Beatty and Roger Stone join me. What else do you
[1:23:31.360 --> 1:23:38.080]  want to depart here to our audience? Okay, you brought up a really good point about why
[1:23:38.080 --> 1:23:42.600]  justice is never served to the other side. I'm going to call it anarchy. They're never
[1:23:42.600 --> 1:23:48.440]  held accountable for violating the law at all because they've hijacked our judiciary
[1:23:48.440 --> 1:23:57.560]  or DOJ. We've got Soros buying off DA's. Thankfully Chesa Boudin was removed. He's a Bill Ayers,
[1:23:57.560 --> 1:24:04.840]  George Soros leftist that was put in San Francisco. He's been removed. These DA's won't prosecute
[1:24:04.840 --> 1:24:10.320]  anyone on the left side that assists in the left side of the political spectrum and narrative.
[1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:16.520]  It's called anarchy. Then they refer to what they do to us when they of course take the
[1:24:16.520 --> 1:24:23.720]  seat of government by stolen elections. They call it justice and preserving democracy and
[1:24:23.720 --> 1:24:29.880]  they say constitution and democracy and all of that stuff. And no, I'm going to tell you
[1:24:29.880 --> 1:24:38.840]  Alex Jones is living proof of edits, of lies, of omissions, of malicious prosecution, of
[1:24:38.840 --> 1:24:43.480]  even entrapment over a long period of time. I know that they sent their operatives to
[1:24:43.480 --> 1:24:49.440]  Alex Jones to sprinkle fake news only to later on down the road be able to sue him because
[1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:54.120]  they knew that their little operation eventually would result in something that they could
[1:24:54.120 --> 1:25:00.000]  hold him to account to. It's edits, it's lies, it's omissions, it's malicious prosecution
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:05.400]  and entrapment and they want to destroy and break Alex Jones. Notice what they're doing,
[1:25:05.400 --> 1:25:10.440]  the shenanigans. He wants to go to the bankruptcy court and show all of his books. They say,
[1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:15.880]  oh, we'll just dismiss those. We're looking more to do a show trial and to break you financially
[1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:19.840]  and get your viewers to all look away and destroy your operation.
[1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:25.160]  But what they're doing to us legally, I mean, behind the scenes, it's folks, it's unreal.
[1:25:25.160 --> 1:25:30.880]  It's unreal. It's unreal. Now, here's, again, back to the positive side of it. There's a
[1:25:30.880 --> 1:25:35.880]  lot of people that tune into Info Wars. I'm hoping that somebody like Marjorie Taylor-Green
[1:25:35.880 --> 1:25:40.760]  who suspected that there's a reason why they're withholding all the videos. Now, I'm going
[1:25:40.760 --> 1:25:45.480]  to tell those people that are listening, if you're an elected official and you're on the
[1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:52.160]  good side of things, on the godly side of things, then you will demand to find out who
[1:25:52.160 --> 1:25:59.120]  these whistleblowers who have come through a retired senior FBI special agent in charge.
[1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:04.400]  They were trusted with this information to bring it as public as it could be, to get
[1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:11.720]  our elected officials and the attorneys to demand to see the facial recognition software.
[1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:17.520]  That they identified Ray Epps at the front line as a friendly. That's why he got dropped
[1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:22.840]  off the FBI's most wanted list. That the majority of the people at the Brutal were identified
[1:26:22.840 --> 1:26:27.320]  with facial recognition. They have this data. There are people internally, a small group
[1:26:27.320 --> 1:26:32.720]  that identified who they were. Well, I think that that should be very helpful in establishing
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:39.800]  the truth behind who provoked all of the emotion and the chaos and everything that they needed
[1:26:39.800 --> 1:26:45.600]  to bring this day. It's all scripted, folks. Look at every single word was scripted. Every
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:51.920]  single frame was scripted, and it was all for the purposes of deceiving the public.
[1:26:51.920 --> 1:26:56.360]  Don't let them break us. Don't let them break info wars. Don't let them break independent
[1:26:56.360 --> 1:27:00.400]  media. When we say we need your support, look at what we're going up against. When these
[1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:04.600]  people take the seat of government, they have an unlimited budget. They spent millions
[1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:09.480]  and millions of dollars and literally went to the, and they think they think we're stupid.
[1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:13.520]  They think that we don't listen to Liz Cheney say that we knew well in advance. There was
[1:27:13.520 --> 1:27:17.080]  going to be a disastrous insurrection. It was preplanned, blah, blah, blah. And we
[1:27:17.080 --> 1:27:21.760]  had one person at the barricade in the same exact presentation.
[1:27:21.760 --> 1:27:26.640]  If you're an elected official, stop these proceedings because guess what? At minimum,
[1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:31.520]  push the pause button and say, we'll do the proceedings after the trials are completed
[1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:38.240]  because we don't want to prejudice the juries and we don't want to destroy the presumption
[1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:43.120]  of innocence of all of these defendants. What they did to Stuart Rhodes was awful. What
[1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:48.320]  they did, of course, to frame as always, Alex Jones, just within that short clip that they
[1:27:48.320 --> 1:27:52.760]  did yesterday was unacceptable. And ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell you, if you
[1:27:52.760 --> 1:27:57.400]  don't rise up to this thing with the emotion and the energy and the godliness of demand
[1:27:57.400 --> 1:28:01.760]  that your lectures and officials shut this down, what they did to Staff Sergeant Joe
[1:28:01.760 --> 1:28:08.200]  Biggs, a double purple heart recipient, a man who served our country honorably, a man
[1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:14.800]  who now suffers from PTSD needs appropriate medical care, obviously, behind bars. To go
[1:28:14.800 --> 1:28:22.280]  after President Trump at the expense of one of our troops, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs is
[1:28:22.280 --> 1:28:27.560]  nothing that I will ever accept while I'm here on this soil in the United States of
[1:28:27.560 --> 1:28:31.840]  America. If you love your country, you will rise up and not as well.
[1:28:31.840 --> 1:28:34.920]  Yeah, let me just let me just put it like this. People out there thinking, hey, I'm
[1:28:34.920 --> 1:28:38.440]  innocent. I'll never deal with this. Folks, I'm innocent. And look at what I'm going
[1:28:38.440 --> 1:28:42.600]  through. So believe me, no one's innocent in a world run by Democrats. And by the way,
[1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:48.640]  they're estimating the cost of this hearing right now, Pete, at $8 million, $8 million.
[1:28:48.640 --> 1:28:51.880]  That's just what we know, folks. Imagine how much was spent on this Hollywood made for
[1:28:51.880 --> 1:28:55.280]  TV production. Pete Santilli, The Pete Santilli Show. God bless you, brother. Thank you for

[1:33:19.360 --> 1:33:29.360]  Waging War on Corruption, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show. And now, your host,
[1:33:29.360 --> 1:33:31.360]  Owen Troyer.
[1:33:31.360 --> 1:33:38.560]  And Dr. Darren J. Beatty from Revolver.News is about to join us. They've got a new breaking
[1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:44.360]  news story right now, Meet Ray Epps Part 2. And I want to get Darren on to discuss that
[1:33:44.360 --> 1:33:48.960]  and obviously respond to the hearings. He was on Tucker Carlson last night as well. And
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:54.120]  Tucker Carlson's opening lead was so perfect. I want to read to you the opening line right
[1:33:54.120 --> 1:34:02.120]  now as we get Darren on the air from Tucker Carlson last night.
[1:34:02.120 --> 1:34:07.040]  It tells you a lot about the priorities of our ruling class that the rest of us are getting
[1:34:07.040 --> 1:34:13.360]  yet another lecture about January 6th tonight from our moral inferiors no less. An outbreak
[1:34:13.360 --> 1:34:18.920]  of mob violence, a forgettably minor outbreak by recent standards, that took place more
[1:34:18.920 --> 1:34:24.360]  than a year and a half ago. But they've never stopped talking about it. In the meantime,
[1:34:24.360 --> 1:34:30.680]  in the 18 months since January 6th, gas prices have doubled. Drug overdoses have reached their
[1:34:30.680 --> 1:34:37.080]  highest point ever. The U.S. economy is careening towards a devastating recession at best. And
[1:34:37.080 --> 1:34:42.480]  scariest and least noted of all, this country has never in its history been closer to a
[1:34:42.480 --> 1:34:47.960]  nuclear war. Tucker Carlson nailing it last night. Darren Beattie was with him then. Darren
[1:34:47.960 --> 1:34:52.520]  Beattie is with us now. Dr. Beattie, where do you want to start? Do you want to start
[1:34:52.520 --> 1:34:58.240]  with your latest breaking news on Ray Epps, who somehow was able to not be mentioned in
[1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:02.320]  the hearing last night? Or do you want to just come on with your response to the hearing
[1:35:02.320 --> 1:35:05.360]  last night, Dr. Darren Beattie from Evolver.News?
[1:35:05.360 --> 1:35:12.560]  Well, first of all, thanks very much for having me. This is a very important issue. And what
[1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:20.280]  can we really say about this January 6th committee? It's clearly a sham. And really, if a question
[1:35:20.280 --> 1:35:26.160]  is important, if something is central to getting to the bottom of what really happened on January
[1:35:26.160 --> 1:35:31.800]  6th, you can rest assured, they're not going to say anything about it. And as I said on
[1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:39.440]  Tucker last night, there are four or five decisive questions that any objective observer
[1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:46.080]  conducting real investigation doing legitimate detective work would ask to get to the bottom
[1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:52.600]  of the story. And one of those questions is, of course, what's the deal with Ray Epps?
[1:35:52.600 --> 1:35:59.600]  He was the person who we've covered very extensively on Evolver.News for the full story. Just go
[1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:05.000]  to the site and read it for yourself. But he's the only person who's caught on camera
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:10.480]  in the mountains of documentary footage on that day and the day prior, calling on the
[1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:17.560]  crowd to go into the Capitol. And he does it, in fact, the night before. And he follows
[1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:24.080]  up on his mission the next day. On that decisive day, January 6th, he's ubiquitous. He's everywhere.
[1:36:24.080 --> 1:36:31.040]  He's there way before Trump's speech even ended. And he's directing people to go to
[1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:37.520]  the Capitol, quote, unquote, where our problems are. And then finally, at the very first breach
[1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:42.560]  point in the Capitol, the very first breach, decisive breach that allowed this rally to
[1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:48.360]  turn into a riot that occurred at approximately one PM, actually more around like 1256 to
[1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:54.600]  be more precise. Ray Epps was right there. He was right there by the barricade. He whispers
[1:36:54.600 --> 1:37:00.000]  into someone's ear that someone's called Ryan Samsell. And then no more than two seconds
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:06.440]  later, Samsell breaks down the barrier and the whole crowd goes in and the rest is history.
[1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:12.360]  And yet of all the people that they've subpoenaed, of all the people that they've arrested for
[1:37:12.360 --> 1:37:18.200]  nothing charges, you know this better than anybody for nothing trespassing charges. We
[1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:24.480]  could talk about the whole trespassing stuff later. Of all the people that they've demonized,
[1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:32.560]  the one person that these committee members actively protect and actively defend is the
[1:37:32.560 --> 1:37:38.200]  one person who's caught on camera telling people to go into the Capitol and following
[1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:43.280]  it up by apparently orchestrating that first and decisive breach. This is the story of
[1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:49.200]  Ray Epps and this is the story that the January 6th committee does not want you to hear about,
[1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:53.480]  does not want you to read about. They don't want you to go to revolver.news and read it
[1:37:53.480 --> 1:38:00.640]  and share it with everybody you know. And let's just reiterate and capsulize that.
[1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:08.080]  Of the entire really January 6th day and all the videos and everything that you've seen,
[1:38:08.080 --> 1:38:13.680]  I've seen, the audience has seen, Democrats, Republicans, everybody's seen, to my knowledge
[1:38:13.680 --> 1:38:18.320]  there are still only really two individuals but one who's repeatedly encouraging people
[1:38:18.320 --> 1:38:23.360]  to break down the barriers, repeatedly encourage people to go into the Capitol on record saying
[1:38:23.360 --> 1:38:28.640]  it is Ray Epps. The other one you could say was John Sullivan and some of his own live
[1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:32.440]  streams but that's a separate story. At least he has charges against him, at least he's
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:35.960]  in a legal fight, maybe dropped, it might be a nice smooth ride for him but that's not
[1:38:35.960 --> 1:38:41.760]  the point. Ray Epps is the only person on tape multiple times encouraging people to
[1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:47.480]  go into the Capitol and yet he doesn't face charges, he's not mentioned at the hearings
[1:38:47.480 --> 1:38:53.040]  and the Democrats and Adam Kinzinger are protecting him. Why do you suppose that is, Darren?
[1:38:53.040 --> 1:39:00.320]  Well, look it's well known and I've generated a lot of controversy for first bringing you
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:05.880]  know the public's attention, the thesis that January 6th was not what they're telling us
[1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:11.680]  it was. January 6th is just like, you know forget about going way back into history of
[1:39:11.680 --> 1:39:16.680]  the FBI and government operations and things. Let's just go back a few months before January
[1:39:16.680 --> 1:39:21.920]  6th to the Michigan plot which has now been definitively exposed as an FBI entrapment
[1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:26.400]  operation. All the people that they charge they've gotten zero convictions and it turned
[1:39:26.400 --> 1:39:35.400]  out of the original like 26 so-called plotters, 12 were either FBI informants or FBI agents
[1:39:35.400 --> 1:39:40.720]  and keep in mind that this was this Michigan case, people talk about it as the plot to
[1:39:40.720 --> 1:39:46.400]  kidnap the Michigan governor but it was also a plot to storm the Michigan State Capitol.
[1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:53.120]  It was a plot that involved one of the three main militia groups imputed to January 6th
[1:39:53.120 --> 1:39:59.920]  and it was a plot that was infiltrated by the feds to an astonishing percentage and
[1:39:59.920 --> 1:40:05.280]  Revolver News is the first to point out that the FBI special agent in charge in that Detroit
[1:40:05.280 --> 1:40:12.960]  office who oversaw the Michigan plot with striking similarities January 6th, the guy
[1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:24.040]  who oversaw that hoax entrapment operation was in October promoted to the FBI field office
[1:40:24.040 --> 1:40:30.600]  in DC and later went on to oversee the January 6th investigations. In fact, to tie it into
[1:40:30.600 --> 1:40:39.080]  another extremely bizarre and dark and as of yet unexplained aspect of January 6th, it
[1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:44.920]  was precisely this Detroit field office agent in charge who oversaw the entrapment operation
[1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:51.280]  in Michigan later promoted to the DC field office who was everywhere in the media telling
[1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:58.560]  people we need your help to discover the identity of this so-called pipe bomber because pipe
[1:40:58.560 --> 1:41:05.520]  bombs were planted at the DNC and the RNC, we need your help and they provide this nothing
[1:41:05.520 --> 1:41:10.320]  video Revolver.News has the most thorough investigation of this so-called pipe bomb
[1:41:10.320 --> 1:41:17.440]  which is so, so dirty. It's just incredible what they think they can get away with here
[1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:21.840]  and they say, oh, we need your help. They give you grainy video. It's clear that there's
[1:41:21.840 --> 1:41:25.920]  mountains of evidence that they're not just presenting the public because I think their
[1:41:25.920 --> 1:41:31.560]  effort to identify the pipe bomber is disingenuous just in the same way that their effort to
[1:41:31.560 --> 1:41:38.760]  identify Ray Epps was disingenuous. Ray Epps was actually one of the first 20 people to
[1:41:38.760 --> 1:41:44.640]  appear on the FBI's most wanted list for January 6th. They begged the public to identify this
[1:41:44.640 --> 1:41:51.480]  guy. Well, the internet got to work and as the internet is able to do with kind of weaponized
[1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:58.920]  autism as they say, people discovered Ray Epps was very quickly and not shortly after
[1:41:58.920 --> 1:42:05.400]  that, they took him off the most wanted list. They didn't actually want people to know
[1:42:05.400 --> 1:42:11.520]  who he was and I think there's something similar to this pipe bomber. There's just not a sincere
[1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:17.920]  effort to identify it and the reason that the pipe bomb is so suspicious is that we
[1:42:17.920 --> 1:42:25.320]  now only just recently learned that the vice president-elect then Kamala Harris was not
[1:42:25.320 --> 1:42:31.920]  actually in the capitals. She was in the DNC building, the very building that had a pipe
[1:42:31.920 --> 1:42:37.800]  bomb planted right in front of it and somehow the secret service did not discover the pipe
[1:42:37.800 --> 1:42:43.880]  bomb after the sweep. Somehow the secret service didn't discover it. It was only later discovered
[1:42:43.880 --> 1:42:50.020]  by some random passerby who discovered something outside the RNC and then somehow immediately
[1:42:50.020 --> 1:42:58.320]  they found the DNC. That's Dr. Darren Beatty. We got to take a break here. We'll be right
[1:42:58.320 --> 1:42:59.320]  back.
[1:42:59.320 --> 1:43:02.640]  The globalists are making their move. Their great reset is here. They're coming for your
[1:43:02.640 --> 1:43:06.840]  children. They're coming for the value of your currency. They're coming for your national
[1:43:06.840 --> 1:43:12.640]  sovereignty. They're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny. They're
[1:43:12.640 --> 1:43:18.360]  coming for your free speech. They're coming for your privacy and ladies and gentlemen,
[1:43:18.360 --> 1:43:22.440]  they're coming for your right to vote and have your representative in government that
[1:43:22.440 --> 1:43:27.400]  you and your fellow Americans choose. The new film, the seminal film, the most important

[1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:28.880]  and you want to know why and I've tested this and I've taken your B12 and let me tell you
[1:44:28.880 --> 1:44:35.200]  when I don't take it, I pay a price. I really do. I take that B12 and I'm electric man.
[1:44:35.200 --> 1:44:40.720]  I can run 10 miles. I do some pretty heavy work with a highway department and my friends
[1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:47.720]  will attest to the fact that yeah, for a guy in his 60s, you know, pushing 70 and I'm not
[1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:59.240]  just blowing smoke here. The B12 saves my life.
[1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:08.160]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep
[1:45:08.160 --> 1:45:14.720]  prince, that the general public is in, the best word would actually be the people are
[1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:20.920]  lost. Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're in a car or you
[1:45:20.920 --> 1:45:29.200]  get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused.
[1:45:29.200 --> 1:45:33.440]  You have a concussion and that's what the globalists have done. They have stunned us.
[1:45:33.440 --> 1:45:38.360]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings and then Klaus Schwab recently
[1:45:38.360 --> 1:45:42.400]  came out and gave a speech called The Great New Narrative where he brags how the public
[1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:47.280]  is lost, how the culture and the media has been driven to make sure the people are all
[1:45:47.280 --> 1:45:51.640]  alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff. That's what the great
[1:45:51.640 --> 1:45:58.120]  reset is. They need darkness to thrive. The light lives at infowars.com.

[1:46:58.440 --> 1:47:22.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've just gotten at least I've just seen for the first time the
[1:47:22.560 --> 1:47:34.800]  ratings from last night total flop total flop. The biggest ratings obviously CNN and MSNBC
[1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:43.080]  almost drew a zero on this on the on the Nielsen scale, I think is what it is. The highest
[1:47:43.080 --> 1:47:49.640]  and in the 8 p.m. Eastern hour was ABC News getting a half of a percentage, a half of
[1:47:49.640 --> 1:47:59.320]  a percentage and then in the 9 p.m. block ABC getting a sixth of a percentage. So in
[1:47:59.320 --> 1:48:05.600]  other words, Darren, not many people tuned in did not have the public interest that I'm
[1:48:05.600 --> 1:48:10.360]  sure the Democrats were begging for and hoping for. That's why they had all the Hollywood
[1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:15.240]  celebrities and everybody promoting it around the clock like it was a big Hollywood movie.
[1:48:15.240 --> 1:48:22.840]  So it did not get the attention of the American people as I'm sure they hoped it did. Now
[1:48:22.840 --> 1:48:28.360]  aside from that and feel free to comment on that if you'd like, there was another missing
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:32.960]  element to last night that may have kind of been brought up in passing but was not a serious
[1:48:32.960 --> 1:48:40.400]  issue. However, to me, they did all these depositions, Darren, of people who were there
[1:48:40.400 --> 1:48:44.360]  and people who probably said some things that were not good while they were there, maybe
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:49.280]  did some things that they regret while they were there but it was all QAnon stuff. It
[1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:53.760]  was all QAnon told me to be here, QAnon told me we were overthrowing the election, QAnon
[1:48:53.760 --> 1:48:58.120]  told me we were taking the traders out, all this stuff and these are probably people that
[1:48:58.120 --> 1:49:04.160]  are, let's say, easily persuaded. Let's just be kind and say easily persuaded, maybe some
[1:49:04.160 --> 1:49:09.840]  learning disabilities, the typical QAnon follower and so they're out there because QAnon told
[1:49:09.840 --> 1:49:12.560]  them to be there, they thought this whole thing was going down, they take thousands
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:16.680]  of hours of witness testimony, boil it down to the little clips that they can use for
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:22.080]  their Hollywood production but clearly it was Q that motivated those people to be here,
[1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:27.640]  QAnon. Where is the investigation into QAnon? Where is the calling of let's find out who
[1:49:27.640 --> 1:49:33.120]  QAnon is? Why is nobody attempting to bring QAnon in for questioning? Darren, the only
[1:49:33.120 --> 1:49:38.360]  thing I can land on here is QAnon is just another Democrat, another Fed, another entrapment
[1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:46.240]  scheme. That's something that I just don't, I don't know about. I haven't done enough
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:52.520]  research into QAnon. I do know that QAnon, whatever it is, has served as a pretext for
[1:49:52.520 --> 1:50:02.080]  a lot of these sort of disinformation NGOs to use QAnon as a pretext to censor political
[1:50:02.080 --> 1:50:08.640]  speech more broadly but as far as QAnon, what it is and what its relationship is is January
[1:50:08.640 --> 1:50:16.440]  6th, I just don't, that's not a dimension of the story that I've explored efficiently.
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:22.040]  And the problem is that nobody seems to know because my guess is that QAnon was being run
[1:50:22.040 --> 1:50:27.360]  by the feds or run by the government as part of this big entrapment scheme on January 6th
[1:50:27.360 --> 1:50:31.720]  and then they bring out all these witnesses that were told to go there by QAnon and yet
[1:50:31.720 --> 1:50:35.400]  then they blame Donald Trump who had nothing to do with QAnon. They even made Donald Trump
[1:50:35.400 --> 1:50:39.280]  disavow QAnon. You weren't allowed to bring QAnon signs into Trump rallies so they tried
[1:50:39.280 --> 1:50:42.640]  to shut it down but the feds and the Democrats, my guess were the ones running that but that's
[1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:46.000]  fine. We don't have to talk about that. I just wanted to point that out because I noticed
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:52.280]  that from last night. Your latest piece on Revolver.News. Meet Ray Epps part two, damning
[1:50:52.280 --> 1:50:58.640]  new details emerge, exposing massive web of unindicted operators at the heart of January
[1:50:58.640 --> 1:51:07.560]  6th. What do we know about Ray Epps? Why do you suppose that I guess he's just going
[1:51:07.560 --> 1:51:13.080]  to be above all this investigation and then what are the big details in your latest piece
[1:51:13.080 --> 1:51:20.000]  on Revolver.News? Well, this is our latest major piece on January
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:26.760]  6th and really it's required reading for anybody who maybe is not fully up to date,
[1:51:26.760 --> 1:51:32.360]  who's not informed about January 6th or for anybody who has skeptical friends or family
[1:51:32.360 --> 1:51:38.960]  members or if you're skeptical yourself. Take what I call the Revolver challenge. Don't
[1:51:38.960 --> 1:51:44.440]  take my word for it. Read that piece but most importantly watch the video embedded in that
[1:51:44.440 --> 1:51:53.280]  piece if you go to the website version of Revolver.News. Watch all of the compiled embedded videos and
[1:51:53.280 --> 1:52:00.000]  run through the narrative that we present and it's impossible I think after doing that
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:05.600]  exercise to look anyone in the eye to look me in the eye, tell people read this, watch
[1:52:05.600 --> 1:52:09.400]  the video then look me in the eye and tell me that the feds weren't involved. Nobody
[1:52:09.400 --> 1:52:16.480]  can do it. It's definitive here and it's not just Ray Epps by the way. Ray Epps has I think
[1:52:16.480 --> 1:52:22.360]  rightly become sort of the most prominent and infamous figure representing the feds
[1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:30.080]  erection hypothesis but there are a lot of other key individuals who played decisive
[1:52:30.080 --> 1:52:36.200]  roles in that initial breach. I mentioned the trespassing charges that are really being
[1:52:36.200 --> 1:52:42.960]  used politically through selective prosecution in order to punish various people because
[1:52:42.960 --> 1:52:46.880]  there are hundreds and hundreds of people if not thousands who are technically trespassing
[1:52:46.880 --> 1:52:53.200]  on restricted grounds. The only problem is the overwhelming majority probably over 95%
[1:52:53.200 --> 1:52:58.000]  weren't even aware that they were committing a criminal offense because the barriers and
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:03.720]  fencing had been taken down before the crowd got there. Or they were even waved in by police.
[1:53:03.720 --> 1:53:13.160]  Or they were waved in or both or both. The fact is is we have video of individuals methodically
[1:53:13.160 --> 1:53:20.000]  removing fencing way before the speech was even done, way before the main crowd even
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:24.280]  went to the capitol at the direction of people. Oh my gosh I can't even believe this. I've
[1:53:24.280 --> 1:53:27.960]  never actually seen this before. You have the pictures right there. They're cutting
[1:53:27.960 --> 1:53:33.480]  the fence down. Nobody's stopping them. What do we know about these individuals? Well yes
[1:53:33.480 --> 1:53:39.800]  there are key individuals and unlike Ray Epps some of the most egregious actors here who
[1:53:39.800 --> 1:53:46.280]  created the preconditions for the rally to turn into the riot haven't even been identified
[1:53:46.280 --> 1:53:54.400]  publicly. There's one individual called Fence Cutter Bullwark who's represented quite prominently
[1:53:54.400 --> 1:53:59.160]  in the Revolver.News piece that you mentioned and there's another individual I think who
[1:53:59.160 --> 1:54:05.520]  other than Ray Epps is a key figure here but unlike Ray Epps he hasn't even been identified.
[1:54:05.520 --> 1:54:10.640]  He hasn't been put on the FDI Most Wanted List like Epps and of course they took Epps's
[1:54:10.640 --> 1:54:16.040]  name off there as soon as we started reporting on this stuff but still there's zero total
[1:54:16.040 --> 1:54:24.320]  radio silence about this individual from the feds. He's known only by his moniker to researchers
[1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:30.520]  as scaffold commander and here's a guy who was again he was stationed there right at
[1:54:30.520 --> 1:54:36.200]  the peace monument right by that initial breach site before the Proud Boys got there, before
[1:54:36.200 --> 1:54:42.080]  all these other people got there. He was there along with other key individuals. He ended
[1:54:42.080 --> 1:54:49.280]  up taking a really strategic position on top of that white scaffold that many people have
[1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:54.960]  seen from video footage on this and he was directing people, coolly, professionally,
[1:54:54.960 --> 1:55:01.640]  but constantly move forward, move forward, move forward and so the experience of your
[1:55:01.640 --> 1:55:07.240]  average rally goer you have people like Epps directing you to the capital after the speech.
[1:55:07.240 --> 1:55:11.920]  You get there, people like Fence Cutter Bullwark had removed the fencing so you don't even know
[1:55:11.920 --> 1:55:17.440]  you're in restricted area and then you hear this confident definitive and constant voice
[1:55:17.440 --> 1:55:22.760]  coming from a bullhorn saying move forward, move forward, we need your help. Now if you
[1:55:22.760 --> 1:55:28.240]  hear that constantly people just as a matter of psychology, as a matter of crowd control,
[1:55:28.240 --> 1:55:32.800]  people obey these authoritative commands especially when they say things like we need
[1:55:32.800 --> 1:55:33.800]  your help.
[1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:37.360]  And that's just where the momentum of the mass of people was going. I mean most people
[1:55:37.360 --> 1:55:39.680]  couldn't even control themselves at that point.
[1:55:39.680 --> 1:55:44.480]  Exactly. Then you know momentum takes over and then you're just caught up in it and
[1:55:44.480 --> 1:55:49.920]  you move forward because everyone around you is moving forward but it takes key individuals
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:55.560]  such as this scaffold commander as of yet unidentified but who played a decisive role
[1:55:55.560 --> 1:56:02.400]  in this whole operation to create the conditions for what happened. And then after he was saying
[1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:07.320]  move forward, move forward, move forward, he started saying okay we need to climb in,
[1:56:07.320 --> 1:56:12.440]  we need you to go in the windows then he actively encouraged people to go into the capital and
[1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:13.440]  break in.
[1:56:13.440 --> 1:56:20.560]  What's amazing is is that the feds have really exhibited zero interest not only in arresting
[1:56:20.560 --> 1:56:27.640]  this guy and questioning him and identifying him, nothing. And as of today, this key player
[1:56:27.640 --> 1:56:32.720]  has not been identified. Nobody knows who he is.
[1:56:32.720 --> 1:56:38.880]  I mean folks this is just, let me try to make an analogy here. Let's say that you have a
[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:47.200]  big building in some metropolitan area and there have been threats made and so somebody
[1:56:47.200 --> 1:56:52.240]  comes to you and says hey there's been a threat made here to your building, you should get
[1:56:52.240 --> 1:56:57.520]  security and then you take out a big insurance policy on your building and you don't get
[1:56:57.520 --> 1:57:03.960]  security and then there's video footage of people pouring gasoline all around your building
[1:57:03.960 --> 1:57:10.720]  and then lighting it on fire and then you have a big insurance payout and then somebody
[1:57:10.720 --> 1:57:15.400]  doesn't investigate the person pouring gas, doesn't investigate the person lighting the
[1:57:15.400 --> 1:57:19.800]  fire, doesn't investigate the person who takes out the big insurance before the fire, doesn't
[1:57:19.800 --> 1:57:25.180]  investigate the person that stands down security before the fire. Any other investigator would
[1:57:25.180 --> 1:57:28.600]  say hey I'm going to investigate that person, I'm going to investigate those people, but
[1:57:28.600 --> 1:57:34.560]  Not this time, the person that lit the fire, poured the gas, turned down the security and
[1:57:34.560 --> 1:57:40.200]  bought the insurance package is the one not being investigated in the arson.
[1:57:40.200 --> 1:57:44.440]  This is unprecedented stuff and I think the Democrats plan to use this against innocent
[1:57:44.440 --> 1:57:48.240]  Americans forever.

[2:00:15.320 --> 2:00:16.320]  us.
[2:00:16.320 --> 2:00:19.120]  Darren, I think they're going to be using January 6 against their political opposition
[2:00:19.120 --> 2:00:20.120]  forever.
[2:00:20.120 --> 2:00:21.120]  That's their plan.
[2:00:21.120 --> 2:00:25.720]  They just arrested a GOP governor candidate in Michigan just out of nowhere because he
[2:00:25.720 --> 2:00:27.440]  was leading in the polls.
[2:00:27.440 --> 2:00:32.560]  I mean, a lot of people they're charging weren't even there in Washington, D.C., let alone
[2:00:32.560 --> 2:00:33.560]  my story.
[2:00:33.560 --> 2:00:37.560]  He never went into the building, passed, never touched anybody, never did anything.
[2:00:37.560 --> 2:00:41.760]  But, I mean, Enrique Tarrio wasn't even there, Roger Stone wasn't even there.
[2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:43.320]  I think they want to take this to the next level.
[2:00:43.320 --> 2:00:47.000]  Oh, you talked about a rigged election, oh, you supported Donald Trump, they want to come
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  arrest you.
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:52.480]  I mean, where do you think it goes from here, even though their ratings flopped, they have,
[2:00:52.480 --> 2:00:55.160]  I think, three more of these things planned.
[2:00:55.160 --> 2:01:01.600]  Where do you think this corrupted authoritarian, tyrannical, I don't even know how else to
[2:01:01.600 --> 2:01:02.600]  describe this.
[2:01:02.600 --> 2:01:05.800]  I don't know if anything this bad has ever happened, you know, as far as the political
[2:01:05.800 --> 2:01:10.080]  party weaponizing the government against the people in U.S. history, where do you think
[2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:13.560]  the Democrats take this next, Dr. Darren J. Bede?
[2:01:13.560 --> 2:01:22.960]  Well, that's an excellent observation and I think it really has incumbent on us to remember
[2:01:22.960 --> 2:01:26.800]  what the stakes are here, what the purpose is, what is the agenda.
[2:01:26.800 --> 2:01:29.480]  It isn't really about January 6.
[2:01:29.480 --> 2:01:38.760]  It's about the significance, the false narrative of January 6 holds to further the regime's
[2:01:38.760 --> 2:01:39.760]  agenda.
[2:01:39.760 --> 2:01:46.040]  And that agenda is the reconfiguration and really the weaponization of the American national
[2:01:46.040 --> 2:01:54.080]  security apparatus against American people to silence, suppress, and destroy the energies
[2:01:54.080 --> 2:02:00.320]  associated with movements like the Donald Trump movement, but not just that, any movement
[2:02:00.320 --> 2:02:04.400]  that could be threatening to the regime and its hold on power.
[2:02:04.400 --> 2:02:05.920]  And that's what it's about.
[2:02:05.920 --> 2:02:11.040]  The Department of Homeland Security is spearheading what some people have called the domestic
[2:02:11.040 --> 2:02:12.200]  war on terror.
[2:02:12.200 --> 2:02:13.200]  And guess what?
[2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:17.840]  Benny Thompson, who is the chairman of the January 6 committee, is also the chairman
[2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:25.000]  of the Homeland Security Committee, he is the Department of Homeland Security's stooge
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:31.920]  in Congress and he's conducting an investigation, a sham investigation on January 6, the false
[2:02:31.920 --> 2:02:38.560]  narrative about which is used as the propelling pretext for the Department of Homeland Security's
[2:02:38.560 --> 2:02:46.680]  reconfiguration as a political tool to silence and suppress and destroy Trump supporters.
[2:02:46.680 --> 2:02:49.280]  So that's really what's going on.
[2:02:49.280 --> 2:02:50.280]  Those are the stakes.
[2:02:50.280 --> 2:02:55.480]  That's why, despite how boring or irrelevant a lot of this stuff is, it's really just boring
[2:02:55.480 --> 2:02:56.840]  from the side they're talking about.
[2:02:56.840 --> 2:03:03.840]  It's actually explosive and dark, but extremely interesting to investigate what actually happened
[2:03:03.840 --> 2:03:09.640]  there because it opens up an entire can of worms that's entirely alien to most American
[2:03:09.640 --> 2:03:14.320]  people or naive, comfortably naive about the nature of their own government and the types
[2:03:14.320 --> 2:03:19.000]  of the operations that the government has been conducting against their citizens, not
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  just in January 6, but going back a long time.
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:26.520]  And this is just the tip of the iceberg in that regard.
[2:03:26.520 --> 2:03:30.600]  And so I hope everyone will go to revolver.news, read our piece with an open mind and share
[2:03:30.600 --> 2:03:36.440]  it and begin the educational process because the stakes are too high to be ignorant on this
[2:03:36.440 --> 2:03:37.440]  issue.
[2:03:37.440 --> 2:03:38.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:03:38.440 --> 2:03:44.040]  And it's just, the more they flop, it seems like the more aggressive they get.
[2:03:44.040 --> 2:03:48.880]  And I just want to tell you also, Dr. Beatty, that I have just been sent information from
[2:03:48.880 --> 2:03:49.880]  Pete Santilli.
[2:03:49.880 --> 2:03:55.080]  He says he has identified the fence cutting bulwark.
[2:03:55.080 --> 2:04:00.280]  So if you'd like, I can forward that information to you and maybe your team can get to work
[2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:01.480]  on that.
[2:04:01.480 --> 2:04:05.640]  Yep, we're definitely looking, definitely looking for tips.
[2:04:05.640 --> 2:04:09.320]  So we'll pursue that and see where it leads.
[2:04:09.320 --> 2:04:10.320]  Wonderful.
[2:04:10.320 --> 2:04:11.320]  We'll send you that information.
[2:04:11.320 --> 2:04:15.160]  And Dr. Darren Beatty from revolver.news.
[2:04:15.160 --> 2:04:16.160]  Thank you so much.
[2:04:16.160 --> 2:04:17.160]  God bless you.
[2:04:17.160 --> 2:04:18.160]  Godspeed.
[2:04:18.160 --> 2:04:20.920]  And folks, just pray for people like Darren Beatty who are putting everything on the line
[2:04:20.920 --> 2:04:24.240]  to stand up against this political corruption in the Democrat Party, folks.
[2:04:24.240 --> 2:04:25.240]  It's no joke.
[2:04:25.240 --> 2:04:26.240]  These people mean business.
[2:04:26.240 --> 2:04:29.120]  In case you haven't noticed, they shoot and kill Ashley Babbitt and they celebrate it.
[2:04:29.120 --> 2:04:31.200]  And that's just one of their political murders.
[2:04:31.200 --> 2:04:34.320]  So, Darren Beatty, thank you so much for joining us today.
[2:04:34.320 --> 2:04:37.040]  Revolver.news, folks, is where you can find all the information.
[2:04:37.040 --> 2:04:38.040]  All right.
[2:04:38.040 --> 2:04:42.200]  When we come back, Alex Jones is going to be joining us with some of his latest breaking
[2:04:42.200 --> 2:04:45.720]  information and response to what we saw last night.
[2:04:45.720 --> 2:04:51.880]  And I've got other big stories and videos to cover as we enter the third hour now of
[2:04:51.880 --> 2:05:17.880]  the Alex Jones show.
[2:05:17.880 --> 2:05:46.500]  Thanks for watching this video.
[2:05:46.500 --> 2:05:53.300]  today.com. That's preparetoday.com or simply type in preparewithalex.com and it's a hyperlink
[2:05:53.300 --> 2:05:58.300]  to preparetoday.com. Get prepared now at preparetoday.com.
[2:05:58.300 --> 2:06:12.300]  You've found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[2:06:12.300 --> 2:06:16.980]  You know folks, I've got to tell you, I don't know about you but there's something in the
[2:06:16.980 --> 2:06:25.380]  air. There's something in the air here and I just want to be clear as we're about to
[2:06:25.380 --> 2:06:30.100]  be joined by Alex Jones because I know he shares this same sentiment but I'll speak
[2:06:30.100 --> 2:06:37.060]  for myself. I have no intention and never had any intention of being a violent revolutionary.
[2:06:37.060 --> 2:06:41.820]  Not my thing. I'm not a violent person. I don't like fighting. I don't really like combat.
[2:06:41.820 --> 2:06:47.380]  I'm not really big into hunting. I never wanted to join the military. I like talking. I like
[2:06:47.380 --> 2:06:51.340]  telling the truth. I like justice. I like freedom. That's what motivates me to be here.
[2:06:51.340 --> 2:06:56.180]  I'm a lover of life. I love life so much. I want to preserve the life that we have here.
[2:06:56.180 --> 2:07:03.180]  That's what motivates me and so that's the driving force here but you hear talks about
[2:07:03.180 --> 2:07:10.140]  a cold civil war. Folks, the Democrats are already hot. They already have political prisoners.
[2:07:10.140 --> 2:07:14.320]  They're already censoring free speech. They're already killing Trump supporters. They show
[2:07:14.320 --> 2:07:19.540]  up to Supreme Court justices' houses to murder them. They try to do mass murders at baseball
[2:07:19.540 --> 2:07:24.380]  practices. So I don't even really know how to properly handle it or analyze it at this
[2:07:24.380 --> 2:07:29.980]  point, Alex, as they're trying to destroy us and end our country and we're just lovers
[2:07:29.980 --> 2:07:34.740]  of life. I mean, I know you, Alex. You're a big loving fuzzball but we have a commitment
[2:07:34.740 --> 2:07:39.500]  and a passion to freedom and truth that drives us to this transmission every day that resonates
[2:07:39.500 --> 2:07:44.780]  with the people. So I mean, I know you've got big information and lots of stuff to analyze
[2:07:44.780 --> 2:07:49.940]  here but I mean, just being in this historic moment, seeing where the Democrats are going,
[2:07:49.940 --> 2:07:53.060]  I don't know if there's ever been such an evil force in this country. I don't know if
[2:07:53.060 --> 2:07:56.820]  the country has ever experienced the government being weaponized against the people like we're
[2:07:56.820 --> 2:08:02.540]  seeing right now. I mean, how do we harness this energy for good? How do we take these
[2:08:02.540 --> 2:08:06.780]  trying times and turn them into a positive for America to unite the people, to bring
[2:08:06.780 --> 2:08:12.140]  people together back with love and a desire for freedom and prosperity? Because I know
[2:08:12.140 --> 2:08:14.660]  it's there, Alex. I know it's there.
[2:08:14.660 --> 2:08:20.780]  Well, Owen, you just stole my thunder when we had talk before I came on the show here.
[2:08:20.780 --> 2:08:24.140]  That's exactly the point I was going to make is that we're in a hot war. They're starting
[2:08:24.140 --> 2:08:28.500]  a civil war. They're a foreign political group. They are the globalist party. They are the
[2:08:28.500 --> 2:08:34.660]  great reset, build back better organization. They are the new world order and they know
[2:08:34.660 --> 2:08:41.780]  they're losing the people from the US to Brazil, to Canada, to Germany, to the UK, to Australia.
[2:08:41.780 --> 2:08:45.300]  And that's why they're putting in this martial law system. And let's just remember, I've
[2:08:45.300 --> 2:08:48.900]  listened to the show today. You haven't really talked about yourself much, but you were there
[2:08:48.900 --> 2:08:54.140]  with us peacefully trying to get people to not go in the Capitol on video and they arrested
[2:08:54.140 --> 2:08:58.700]  you and charged you and said that you broke down barricades and attacked the Capitol and
[2:08:58.700 --> 2:09:03.380]  that, quote, you did not work with info wars and that you'd perjured yourself to federal
[2:09:03.380 --> 2:09:08.180]  court when you said I was with Alex Jones, peaceful. He's not been arrested. Why have
[2:09:08.180 --> 2:09:12.820]  I been arrested? They just said he does not work there. Your honor, he is a liar. And
[2:09:12.820 --> 2:09:18.180]  the federal judge said, I don't care. It's immaterial if they lie. The charges go forward.
[2:09:18.180 --> 2:09:22.500]  That is in the judge's ruling. So that is America where the judge says, yes, they are
[2:09:22.500 --> 2:09:27.220]  lying. You do work at info wars, but I want to go back to last night. There's some clips
[2:09:27.220 --> 2:09:31.500]  on info wars.com. We should probably play him after I leave, but Tucker Carlson knocked
[2:09:31.500 --> 2:09:36.780]  out of the park where he just said, listen, they are framing the American people as terrorists
[2:09:36.780 --> 2:09:42.020]  as their opposition as terrorist. They are creating an authoritarian society, not just
[2:09:42.020 --> 2:09:47.380]  surveillance, not just censorship. We have cases where just two weeks ago, the Antifa
[2:09:47.380 --> 2:09:57.420]  member that shot two random people in the middle of the street in Colorado and the feds said,
[2:09:57.420 --> 2:10:04.820]  okay. And the judge said, no prison time. That's actually shooting people. And so I never
[2:10:04.820 --> 2:10:09.420]  heard Stuart Rhodes or I never heard of those people talk about going into the Capitol.
[2:10:09.420 --> 2:10:14.260]  I never saw any of that information. They, we were all concerned that anti-famon attack
[2:10:14.260 --> 2:10:20.540]  is at our hotel. You know, we, we had security for some of the events we had the days before.
[2:10:20.540 --> 2:10:25.500]  We had big, peaceful rallies. That was probably 500,000 people. The biggest one, you know,
[2:10:25.500 --> 2:10:30.820]  weeks before January 6th, everybody know that they know what we came there for to say, look,
[2:10:30.820 --> 2:10:36.980]  we got a million people. Joe Biden can't fill, you know, a small parking lot and a Jeep dealership
[2:10:36.980 --> 2:10:42.180]  for his rallies. In fact, I saw a meme, a joke, it shows a car salesman slapping on the roof
[2:10:42.180 --> 2:10:46.620]  of the car and saying to the guy that he's trying to sell it to, you can fit four Biden
[2:10:46.620 --> 2:10:51.980]  rallies in this bad boy. So that was our whole point. We stated our point when we wanted the
[2:10:51.980 --> 2:10:57.100]  10 day investigation that the Democrats had called for four years before that the Senate
[2:10:57.100 --> 2:11:01.180]  by law can have if they want, there had been no real investigation. The courts didn't look
[2:11:01.180 --> 2:11:04.580]  at the evidence of fraud. They just said, no, we're not going to do it. And so it was
[2:11:04.580 --> 2:11:09.660]  the house and Senate's job to do that. But everybody knows that. And the American people
[2:11:09.660 --> 2:11:14.140]  are not buying the whole fraud. The January 6th was the new Pearl Harbor, worse than 9-11,
[2:11:14.140 --> 2:11:20.900]  all these preposterous, assign things that were said and done. But the backdrop here
[2:11:20.900 --> 2:11:25.780]  is the white supremacist attack a month ago in Buffalo and the situation two weeks ago
[2:11:25.780 --> 2:11:33.420]  or 16 days ago, 17 days ago in Uvaldi. That's the real issue because if you look at the
[2:11:33.420 --> 2:11:37.500]  whole backdrop of both these stories, they don't add up, they don't make sense. You
[2:11:37.500 --> 2:11:43.460]  have the white supremacist 18 year old mentally ill person with a Fed and daily contact, constant
[2:11:43.460 --> 2:11:49.380]  contacts with FBI admits for two years. So you've got one hand of the FBI investigating
[2:11:49.380 --> 2:11:53.940]  the other hand of the feds. You've got all this going on. And then you've got, you've
[2:11:53.940 --> 2:11:59.300]  got, you know, the Hollywood stars like Matthew McConaughey running around saying, let's take
[2:11:59.300 --> 2:12:04.300]  all the assault weapons, let's take all the rifles and then magically his hometown gets
[2:12:04.300 --> 2:12:10.020]  attacked. And then the police lie 40 plus times, changed their story 18 times. And none
[2:12:10.020 --> 2:12:13.780]  of it adds up. They were having all these drills at the school in the days and weeks
[2:12:13.780 --> 2:12:19.580]  before. Now the police chief that ordered the stand down won't talk to the state police
[2:12:19.580 --> 2:12:25.300]  or the FBI. There's a massive coverup going on. We know we're being lied to. And all of
[2:12:25.300 --> 2:12:30.500]  this right on time is happening. And so I've been saying for, for, for a year, right before
[2:12:30.500 --> 2:12:33.700]  the midterms, you're going to start seeing white supremacist attacks on black grocery
[2:12:33.700 --> 2:12:37.060]  stores. Boom, that happened. You're going to see mass shootings in schools. Boom, that
[2:12:37.060 --> 2:12:41.820]  happened. And I'm not saying that the shooting didn't happen. What I'm saying is, is that
[2:12:41.820 --> 2:12:45.820]  if you look at the anomalies and things, this thing has 10 times the anomalies, a sandy
[2:12:45.820 --> 2:12:51.420]  hook and no one can deny that. So most are listeners just think it didn't happen. Well,
[2:12:51.420 --> 2:12:57.180]  I can't prove that. All I'm saying is, is the season and the timing and it being McConaughey's
[2:12:57.180 --> 2:13:03.580]  town to make him this big hero as they prepare him to run for president, uh, uh, uh, later.
[2:13:03.580 --> 2:13:09.580]  This is massive preparation, ladies and gentlemen, massive, massive, massive, massive evil going
[2:13:09.580 --> 2:13:14.820]  on. Everybody can see it. We know it's synthetic. It's like when you walk into a grocery store,
[2:13:14.820 --> 2:13:19.820]  you can tell a real bag of cherries versus a display of plastic, uh, bananas and apples.
[2:13:19.820 --> 2:13:23.820]  Now, you know, when you look at the plastic banana, what type of plastic is it made of?
[2:13:23.820 --> 2:13:27.980]  Where was it made? You don't know looking at it, but you know, it's fake. You know, it's
[2:13:27.980 --> 2:13:33.300]  not real. You know that something is inherently wrong with it. You know, it's synthetic.
[2:13:33.300 --> 2:13:37.260]  Even the best CG, people can look at it in movies and say, I don't know why it's CG,
[2:13:37.260 --> 2:13:43.060]  but you can tell it's CG. I remember six years ago, Hillary had campaign ads running, uh,
[2:13:43.060 --> 2:13:47.860]  and I remember just seeing dust in the air, looked like 80 millimeter film had shot it,
[2:13:47.860 --> 2:13:52.340]  uh, the scripted answers at a town hall and I said on air, that's a fake town hall. Those
[2:13:52.340 --> 2:13:57.700]  are actors. It came out a month later. It was all fake, a fake town hall with actors
[2:13:57.700 --> 2:14:04.220]  shot on super HD, uh, film cameras or digital film cameras, Hollywood cameras. And, and,
[2:14:04.220 --> 2:14:11.060]  and January 6th, they tried to keep it secret that a former top news and entertainment executive
[2:14:11.060 --> 2:14:18.140]  put out, he ran ABC, that he is running the entire January 6th thing as a scripted deal.
[2:14:18.140 --> 2:14:22.500]  And then they have a lawyer get up there and put up as a document. They're calling this
[2:14:22.500 --> 2:14:26.100]  a hearing, a court. They're swearing people at these things. So that means that they lie.
[2:14:26.100 --> 2:14:32.180]  It's criminal as well. And they play a clip from months before January 6th with Stuart
[2:14:32.180 --> 2:14:36.980]  Rhodes saying, we better all get to DC because anti-fibon attacking people and trying to
[2:14:36.980 --> 2:14:40.340]  intimidate folks in the streets. And we should go there to show our numbers and support Trump
[2:14:40.340 --> 2:14:45.300]  first amendment activity. He was saying to try to stop a civil war. They then take a clip
[2:14:45.300 --> 2:14:51.180]  of him saying, stop civil war, stop blood. And they cut it in with me and say to the
[2:14:51.180 --> 2:14:56.820]  committee and the world and all the major TV stations carrying it and C-spanning radio,
[2:14:56.820 --> 2:15:02.300]  post-fed state-run media, only Fox didn't carry it and said, here is Alex Jones planning
[2:15:02.300 --> 2:15:07.900]  the attack. And Trump directed them to do this. A, Trump didn't direct us to do it.
[2:15:07.900 --> 2:15:15.980]  A, we weren't calling for violence. And B, it was a hearing. It was a show we did from
[2:15:15.980 --> 2:15:22.180]  November months before. So this is the level of criminal perjury. This is the level of
[2:15:22.180 --> 2:15:27.860]  criminal activity. And we have Schiff on the committee who has three times in the committee
[2:15:27.860 --> 2:15:34.140]  falsified documents and taken emails and moved the words around to make it say something
[2:15:34.140 --> 2:15:38.780]  completely different. That's why I took the fifth amendment. I knew that if I didn't go,
[2:15:38.780 --> 2:15:43.220]  they would have me indicted for contempt of Congress like they've done to Navarro.
[2:15:43.220 --> 2:15:47.300]  Alex, we're hitting a break right now. Stay right there, ladies and gentlemen. Alex Jones
[2:15:47.300 --> 2:15:50.940]  on the line. And Adam Schiff, the liar he's talking about, remember, he said he was going
[2:15:50.940 --> 2:15:55.540]  to show you the evidence of Russian inclusion. He never did. He never had it. He lied.
[2:15:55.540 --> 2:16:01.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the truth. We have the smoking gun evidence. We know what
[2:16:01.780 --> 2:16:07.380]  happened during the 2020 election, how the deep state-controlled Democrats stole the
[2:16:07.380 --> 2:16:13.700]  election. All the proof, absolutely cut and dry. There's no denying it. It's the film

[2:16:42.820 --> 2:16:47.340]  that a major presidential election was stolen and it shows how they did it and how they're
[2:16:47.340 --> 2:16:52.940]  planning to do it again. Get 2000 Mules now at infowarstore.com and show it to every one
[2:16:52.940 --> 2:16:57.140]  you can so they don't steal the next election.
[2:16:57.140 --> 2:17:02.540]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[2:17:02.540 --> 2:17:07.100]  a healthier life. InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your
[2:17:07.100 --> 2:17:12.620]  system with a supplement that contains both. This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus
[2:17:12.620 --> 2:17:17.740]  zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store. The rose hips contained
[2:17:17.740 --> 2:17:24.180]  within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[2:17:24.180 --> 2:17:28.980]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[2:17:28.980 --> 2:17:33.700]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[2:17:33.700 --> 2:17:38.460]  shown. As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an
[2:17:38.460 --> 2:17:43.540]  important role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[2:17:43.540 --> 2:17:48.660]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[2:17:48.660 --> 2:17:53.700]  like here in America. So next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarstore.com
[2:17:53.700 --> 2:17:56.460]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie.

[2:18:01.900 --> 2:18:07.060]  still for sale at infowarstore.com. These are real classics. Ladies and gentlemen, they're

[2:18:55.660 --> 2:18:59.700]  You know, it's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when
[2:18:59.700 --> 2:19:03.820]  the internet and mobile technology first came out, which is we thought, you know, this is
[2:19:03.820 --> 2:19:07.100]  going to level the playing field. Everybody's going to have access to the same information
[2:19:07.100 --> 2:19:11.540]  and everybody's going to be able to freely communicate that information. That's our goal,
[2:19:11.540 --> 2:19:16.980]  to get back to that place where we all have access to all of the information. We all have
[2:19:16.980 --> 2:19:22.740]  the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever we want, and
[2:19:22.740 --> 2:19:27.420]  we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying to judge us or
[2:19:27.420 --> 2:19:33.740]  categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations we're
[2:19:33.740 --> 2:19:38.660]  having, because of the internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions, the
[2:19:38.660 --> 2:19:43.340]  people we want to talk to about these things. So that's our goal is to help people take
[2:19:43.340 --> 2:19:47.260]  back their freedom by helping them to take back their privacy. And so that's really what
[2:19:47.260 --> 2:19:54.060]  we're trying to do. And so I hope that everybody listening will check us out at boltowireless.com.
[2:19:54.060 --> 2:20:22.500]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones show. Alex, you were just getting into the known
[2:20:22.500 --> 2:20:29.060]  liar Pete Sand – excuse me, I'm talking to Pete Sandhillie in the break. Adam Schiff,
[2:20:29.060 --> 2:20:34.580]  who said, he said, Alex, I've seen the evidence of Russian collusion. I will prove it to you
[2:20:34.580 --> 2:20:37.540]  that there was Russian collusion with Trump. Turns out the whole thing was made up. Hillary
[2:20:37.540 --> 2:20:42.300]  Clinton, the original Jussie Smollett, and she just ran the whole hoax, made the whole
[2:20:42.300 --> 2:20:46.580]  thing up herself. And then Adam Schiff lied and carried water for her. Now he's doing
[2:20:46.580 --> 2:20:50.780]  the same thing again with this January 6th thing. I mean, if there's any good news to
[2:20:50.780 --> 2:20:56.060]  come to this, Alex, the ratings are really low. Everybody knows the Democrats are liars,
[2:20:56.060 --> 2:20:59.980]  but the problem is it doesn't stop them. They continue to engage in their criminal
[2:20:59.980 --> 2:21:01.860]  activity and their deceit.
[2:21:01.860 --> 2:21:07.900]  Well, I absolutely agree with you. And look, America is in deep trouble. It's been taken
[2:21:07.900 --> 2:21:11.220]  over by foreign multinational corporations. They're literally cutting off the power,
[2:21:11.220 --> 2:21:14.940]  cutting off the energy. They said they would use inflation to destroy us and bankrupt our
[2:21:14.940 --> 2:21:20.580]  system to bring in this new castle society. And finally, Tucker Carlson gets it. Finally,
[2:21:20.580 --> 2:21:27.700]  they're, they're talking like Bolsonaro or Victor Orban, but we need to get everybody
[2:21:27.700 --> 2:21:32.740]  understanding that we're under attack. And these people know exactly what they've done
[2:21:32.740 --> 2:21:38.060]  and they know exactly what they are establishing. And so I just want listeners to understand
[2:21:38.060 --> 2:21:41.660]  that they're trying to censor and shut us down because they want to censor and shut
[2:21:41.660 --> 2:21:46.320]  you down. And I know that listeners and audience get this, but inforges has almost become
[2:21:46.320 --> 2:21:52.660]  passe now because everything we said came true. Well, folks should understand the rest
[2:21:52.660 --> 2:21:54.260]  of it's going to come true.
[2:21:54.260 --> 2:21:58.460]  Total planetary collapse, billions starving to death and dying over the next decade. The
[2:21:58.460 --> 2:22:05.460]  plan of it into 2030 is nothing less than mass genocide on a global scale. And so that
[2:22:05.460 --> 2:22:12.420]  isn't hype. That isn't BS. That isn't rhetorical rhetoric to demonize our political opponents.
[2:22:12.420 --> 2:22:18.260]  That's the reality. Everybody knows it. And so that's why I am so extremely dedicated
[2:22:18.260 --> 2:22:22.660]  doing everything I can to stop these people. And that's why listeners have to understand
[2:22:22.660 --> 2:22:26.860]  imports is so precious because it really is the brain trust and the, and the brainchild
[2:22:26.860 --> 2:22:31.340]  of, of, of not just myself, the people that came before us that saw this coming that knew
[2:22:31.340 --> 2:22:36.100]  what was happening. It was mainly a good FBI agents and good people in the Pentagon and
[2:22:36.100 --> 2:22:41.340]  good people in intelligence agencies and good people in Congress that in the 50s, 60s, 70s
[2:22:41.340 --> 2:22:45.660]  and 80s held a lot of this back. And we're saying this group's trying to take over. This
[2:22:45.660 --> 2:22:49.420]  is their plan. They want to make you poor so they can enslave you and then you populate
[2:22:49.420 --> 2:22:52.740]  you. They're going to put computers in, in control of everything. They're going to build
[2:22:52.740 --> 2:22:57.140]  a technocracy. They're going to monitor everywhere you go and, and you buy and sell with face
[2:22:57.140 --> 2:23:01.100]  scans and hand scans because they had face scanners and, and retina scanners back in
[2:23:01.100 --> 2:23:06.220]  the 60s folks. And that's why it's in the 1980s James Bond movies. This is all old stuff
[2:23:06.220 --> 2:23:11.460]  that they have been trying to move forward and, and, and, and attack us with. And for
[2:23:11.460 --> 2:23:14.140]  decades and decades, the globals would just say, Oh, there's no builder group. Oh, there's
[2:23:14.140 --> 2:23:17.700]  no new world order. Oh, there's no plan for world government. Oh, there's no plan to break
[2:23:17.700 --> 2:23:20.780]  up the family. Oh, there's no plan to promote pedophilia. Oh, there's no plan to evaluate
[2:23:20.780 --> 2:23:25.220]  the currency. Oh, there's no plan to get rid of the borders. But now it should be very
[2:23:25.220 --> 2:23:29.340]  easy to beat these people because we're in it. And I know we've got hundreds of articles
[2:23:29.340 --> 2:23:32.580]  and dozens of videos and so much to cover here today, but I just go back to the fact
[2:23:32.580 --> 2:23:35.940]  that we have to know we're in a war. We have to know who's running the war. We have to
[2:23:35.940 --> 2:23:39.660]  know what their aims are, how they tick, how they're financed, how they operate and just
[2:23:39.660 --> 2:23:44.980]  wake up as a people, not just in America, but worldwide and say, no to this system.
[2:23:44.980 --> 2:23:49.460]  We've also got to be prepared. You know, so many people are stockpiling guns and ammunition.
[2:23:49.460 --> 2:23:52.940]  That's fine. Defend yourself. And it's a great check against tyranny. But if we don't use
[2:23:52.940 --> 2:23:56.740]  the first amendment to override and stop all this tyranny, we'll never use the second
[2:23:56.740 --> 2:24:01.100]  amendment as the last dish effort if we fell with the first. So we don't want to give them
[2:24:01.100 --> 2:24:04.540]  the civil war they want because they'll play us off against each other. It won't be a war
[2:24:04.540 --> 2:24:08.740]  against the globalists the way they're setting it up. We want to fix this peacefully. That's
[2:24:08.740 --> 2:24:12.460]  why I go back to this. Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't have storable food and if you
[2:24:12.460 --> 2:24:18.140]  don't have water filtration and if you don't have air filtration, you are a sitting duck.
[2:24:18.140 --> 2:24:23.780]  Those things are just as important as firearms. They're just as important as anything else
[2:24:23.780 --> 2:24:26.900]  you can have. Now, a relationship with God is number one. Having friends and family,
[2:24:26.900 --> 2:24:32.260]  you can work together and defend each other is absolutely key. And then if you have God
[2:24:32.260 --> 2:24:41.140]  and then family, then comes defense and food and water and a rural exit route, if you can
[2:24:41.140 --> 2:24:45.540]  and separately then fight in the info war to keep organizations that fight for you and
[2:24:45.540 --> 2:24:51.900]  your family's future and expose and politically lays or illuminate the enemy and spotlight
[2:24:51.900 --> 2:24:56.780]  the cockroaches as the great Ted Nugent says. So I encourage everybody to keep in force
[2:24:56.780 --> 2:25:01.100]  on the air to keep spreading the word about the broadcast and to go to preparedtoday.com.
[2:25:01.100 --> 2:25:05.980]  That's the new clearinghouse with our partners so that the orders go out within a day to
[2:25:05.980 --> 2:25:10.220]  two days, everything's in stock, the water filtration, the air filtration, the food,
[2:25:10.220 --> 2:25:14.220]  the hundreds of award-winning high quality preparedness items that are in many cases
[2:25:14.220 --> 2:25:17.820]  the lowest price you're going to find because my Patriot is the biggest supplier in the
[2:25:17.820 --> 2:25:23.180]  U.S. that they're the maker of the Alexa Pure and the Alexa Pure Breeze. They're the
[2:25:23.180 --> 2:25:27.300]  makers of all this. They're a huge company all over the U.S. and they give us the best
[2:25:27.300 --> 2:25:32.340]  deals and so I said to them, I said, listen, you guys just set up our own separate big
[2:25:32.340 --> 2:25:36.180]  deal that you were on, that way the orders come through, it goes right to you, that way
[2:25:36.180 --> 2:25:40.940]  we don't take the orders then for our store.com, it goes right through you so there's no hand
[2:25:40.940 --> 2:25:45.060]  off that can even hold things up a couple of days and they've got the storeable food
[2:25:45.060 --> 2:25:51.940]  in stock right now at preparedtoday.com, the URL, preparewithalex.com, redirects there
[2:25:51.940 --> 2:25:57.700]  preparewithalex.com or preparetoday.com and ladies and gentlemen, it is a win-win. You
[2:25:57.700 --> 2:26:01.980]  get prepared, you get ready, the food's ready to ship, it beats inflation because it's obviously
[2:26:01.980 --> 2:26:05.540]  already going to explode in prices until years go by, it already has. They haven't raised
[2:26:05.540 --> 2:26:08.580]  prices in a year, they're going to have to raise them soon but they bought a huge stock
[2:26:08.580 --> 2:26:14.260]  pile of food, major investment and they're ready to ship it to you right now at a third
[2:26:14.260 --> 2:26:19.460]  the price of the stuff and cost in the grocery store and its high quality so preparetoday.com
[2:26:19.460 --> 2:26:23.100]  you can also go to infowarstore.com where we have 2,000 mules that everybody needs on
[2:26:23.100 --> 2:26:27.420]  DVD with the expanded extras so you can show it to your neighbors, your friends, your family,
[2:26:27.420 --> 2:26:32.780]  perfect strangers and there's other big discounts with 2,000 mules at infowarstore.com with other
[2:26:32.780 --> 2:26:38.380]  documentaries like in-game blueprint for global enslavement, the new part three, the shot,
[2:26:38.380 --> 2:26:44.700]  most powerful of the three, COVID land, you get it discounted with 2,000 mules when you
[2:26:44.700 --> 2:26:49.260]  buy them as a combo because the enemy is trying to shut us down until two months ago we were
[2:26:49.260 --> 2:26:53.660]  in the red worse than I even thought. We would have had to already have massive layoffs and
[2:26:53.660 --> 2:26:58.500]  huge problems but by the grace of God we had a lot of small donations, folks stepped up
[2:26:58.500 --> 2:27:04.540]  and bought a lot of products at infowarstore.com and for the first time ever we had big donors.
[2:27:04.540 --> 2:27:09.820]  Previously our biggest donors were $50,000, $80,000 and that only happened a few times.
[2:27:09.820 --> 2:27:14.420]  The average donation was like $50 but we don't know who this donor is with Bitcoin but they
[2:27:14.420 --> 2:27:20.500]  literally pulled our ass out of the fire and then I did more accounting and found out I'm
[2:27:20.500 --> 2:27:23.700]  not going to get into it all but things were even worse than we thought because product
[2:27:23.700 --> 2:27:28.060]  prices have gone up, supply chains have broken down, we can't get in a lot of the best selling
[2:27:28.060 --> 2:27:32.420]  products like DNA force and others that have been staples to have us be able to fund ourselves
[2:27:32.420 --> 2:27:37.140]  and so we were screwed and I literally sort of praying, I never really prayed before for
[2:27:37.140 --> 2:27:42.500]  God to send this money and my prayers have almost basically always been answered and
[2:27:42.500 --> 2:27:46.740]  it's like the Garth Brooks song though, some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
[2:27:46.740 --> 2:27:49.940]  when I was younger I'd pray for a few things but please let me have that girl back, please
[2:27:49.940 --> 2:27:54.460]  let me win this football game, that was stupid stuff, God doesn't listen to that but God
[2:27:54.460 --> 2:27:57.380]  does listen when you've done the right thing and you're standing up and you're proving
[2:27:57.380 --> 2:28:00.900]  you're fighting and that's an example not just for info wars but for all of you out
[2:28:00.900 --> 2:28:05.300]  there that are steadfast and God knows your heart and knows you care, pray to God, God
[2:28:05.300 --> 2:28:09.460]  will answer your prayers ladies and gentlemen if it lines up with God's larger plans.
[2:28:09.460 --> 2:28:14.620]  So thank you all for the support, it's been absolutely insane and I was pulling my hair
[2:28:14.620 --> 2:28:18.060]  out, totally stressed out just two months ago, I was going to have to cut people's
[2:28:18.060 --> 2:28:23.060]  pay in half, lay folks off, start basically shutting down and imploding but by the grace
[2:28:23.060 --> 2:28:27.460]  of God folks have come through so we can battle all the criminal charges against Owen so we
[2:28:27.460 --> 2:28:31.980]  can battle all the Democrat lawsuits that are coming to a head right now, God has provided
[2:28:31.980 --> 2:28:35.540]  us to give us provision, the listeners have done that, God has worked through them so
[2:28:35.540 --> 2:28:38.820]  I want to thank those folks that have donated whether it was 20 bucks or the individual
[2:28:38.820 --> 2:28:42.340]  that donated millions or whether it was a thousand dollars or whether it's buying product
[2:28:42.340 --> 2:28:46.500]  to them for store.com or prepare2day.com it's really been amazing but Owen they're going
[2:28:46.500 --> 2:28:52.060]  next level went on national television under oath with swearing people in claiming it's

[2:32:12.900 --> 2:32:18.620]  the sun like me i was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but
[2:32:18.620 --> 2:32:24.140]  since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually
[2:32:24.140 --> 2:32:30.380]  people think i'm 55 years old and i was already taking your other supplements but i thought
[2:32:30.380 --> 2:32:34.260]  you know well maybe that's what i need to do because i just thought it was a hopeless
[2:32:34.260 --> 2:32:38.780]  situation but when i've been taking it i mean it doesn't happen immediately but you know
[2:32:38.780 --> 2:32:44.580]  over a period of time i started noticing okay you know this is the ticket this is working
[2:32:44.580 --> 2:32:50.060]  this is wonderful you know i don't i don't have to put on derma blend anymore you know
[2:32:50.060 --> 2:32:58.340]  so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin leading a frontal
[2:32:58.340 --> 2:33:18.740]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones you found it the tip of the
[2:33:18.740 --> 2:33:31.980]  spear it is the alex jones show with owin shroyer there's no doubt the corruption of
[2:33:31.980 --> 2:33:38.580]  washington dc the corruption of mainstream media has never been more prevalent more
[2:33:38.580 --> 2:33:46.580]  obvious for the american people to witness and to see on a daily basis now and they're
[2:33:46.580 --> 2:33:51.740]  getting crushed with the party policies of the democrats that are causing record inflation
[2:33:51.740 --> 2:34:01.620]  rates 8.6 in may record food prices record gas prices energy prices i mean it's it's
[2:34:01.620 --> 2:34:05.660]  unreal folks i mean anybody and everybody now you're paying double for your grocery
[2:34:05.660 --> 2:34:10.860]  bill you're paying double at the gas pump and by the way that's not stopping that's
[2:34:10.860 --> 2:34:19.100]  only going to get worse but how do we juxtapose or i guess the question alex is we know we're
[2:34:19.100 --> 2:34:24.940]  being gaslit about january 6 we know that the entire january 6 investigation is just
[2:34:24.940 --> 2:34:33.300]  another power grab and another weapon or weaponization of the u.s. government against the political
[2:34:33.300 --> 2:34:38.580]  opposition of the democrat party but for most people that's not the real issue the real
[2:34:38.580 --> 2:34:43.180]  issue is how they're being crushed by democrat party policy that joe biden just blamed on
[2:34:43.180 --> 2:34:49.340]  vladimir putin in a speech today how do we get people to understand that it's all connected
[2:34:49.340 --> 2:34:54.060]  how do we get people to understand that there's a big agenda the great reset build back better
[2:34:54.060 --> 2:34:59.420]  world economic forum world health organization bill gates how do we get people to understand
[2:34:59.420 --> 2:35:04.380]  that they're slowly deteriorating your rights attacking the founding of this country attacking
[2:35:04.380 --> 2:35:08.820]  the bill of rights attacking american patriots attacking free speech attacking the second
[2:35:08.820 --> 2:35:15.380]  amendment and how that's all tied into the fact they're intentionally dropping an economic
[2:35:15.380 --> 2:35:21.140]  bomb on us with the inflation and everything else plus the welfare state plus the open
[2:35:21.140 --> 2:35:27.260]  borders and because that's the key alex once people figure all of that out which slowly
[2:35:27.260 --> 2:35:33.300]  but surely they are it's a race against time how do we then manifest that into restoring
[2:35:33.300 --> 2:35:40.940]  what america is supposed to be well you just have to know that again we we're in a war
[2:35:40.940 --> 2:35:45.660]  it is a declared globalist war against civilization is declared war against america whose ideas
[2:35:45.660 --> 2:35:50.340]  of freedom are incompatible with their corrupt technocracy world government they're establishing
[2:35:50.340 --> 2:35:53.860]  so that's it oh and we keep going back to that we've got hundreds of clips hundreds
[2:35:53.860 --> 2:35:57.940]  of articles we've got all these things we can cover but all of them are symptoms of the
[2:35:57.940 --> 2:36:02.900]  new world order and they now know we're awake they now know know that we're taking our country
[2:36:02.900 --> 2:36:08.340]  back peacefully so they want to overturn the chessboard with a civil war with violence
[2:36:08.340 --> 2:36:13.900]  and it's not going to work it has blown up in their face they've done the same policies
[2:36:13.900 --> 2:36:17.540]  time and time again in third world countries the same system inflation the same system
[2:36:17.540 --> 2:36:21.940]  of years of riots and then the country collapses in the global spot of a penny's a dollar that
[2:36:21.940 --> 2:36:27.980]  is not going to work here and so this is the immovable object comes into contact with
[2:36:27.980 --> 2:36:32.380]  unstoppable force this is going to be extremely explosive that's why we've got a call for
[2:36:32.380 --> 2:36:36.300]  peace we've got a call for justice we've got a call for truth not just because that's
[2:36:36.300 --> 2:36:41.060]  the right thing to do but because we're winning with the ideas of freedom and liberty we're
[2:36:41.060 --> 2:36:47.100]  winning hearts and minds at a record level the body politic not just here but all the
[2:36:47.100 --> 2:36:51.580]  planet is so ready for the truth and I'm just honored to be a part of info wars and I know
[2:36:51.580 --> 2:36:55.900]  all you great people and all the crew and the host and the listeners the affiliates
[2:36:55.900 --> 2:37:00.460]  and the sponsors and everybody because we're on the right side of history and it's a great
[2:37:00.460 --> 2:37:04.820]  honor to be here but I'm just gonna say this in closing when you get back to the news again
[2:37:04.820 --> 2:37:08.980]  I only watched part of that yesterday it's so sick but I watched a bunch of highlights
[2:37:08.980 --> 2:37:13.820]  last night this morning are the lowlights and again to watch them say you're under oath
[2:37:13.820 --> 2:37:20.060]  this is a real hearing and then sit there and put on fabricated evidence edited tapes
[2:37:20.060 --> 2:37:24.980]  things out of context putting one thing on one day when it's from two months before just
[2:37:24.980 --> 2:37:31.460]  all of that is absolutely criminal and it just shows they have no bottom but as you said
[2:37:31.460 --> 2:37:37.180]  the more they lose the more they double quadruple quintuple down and they do it again and these
[2:37:37.180 --> 2:37:41.620]  people are destroying themselves in front of us the question is can they take us down
[2:37:41.620 --> 2:37:45.540]  with them they've already inflated the currencies where this kind of collapse they're just using
[2:37:45.540 --> 2:37:49.940]  the money now to consolidate control while cutting money off to us giving themselves
[2:37:49.940 --> 2:37:54.660]  all the inflated currency to buy up the infrastructure so this is economic war it's all been planned
[2:37:54.660 --> 2:37:58.580]  out the bastards brag about it over there at their debauched group but something with
[2:37:58.580 --> 2:38:02.860]  the public mouthpiece of the Bilderberg group and it's insane so the people have a choice
[2:38:02.860 --> 2:38:06.500]  and then there's all these mainline articles about suddenly record heart attacks in young
[2:38:06.500 --> 2:38:11.580]  people and blood clots in women but why 40% increase in death in young people no one knows
[2:38:11.580 --> 2:38:16.460]  where it's coming from suddenly you know a hundred plus percent percentage in death
[2:38:16.460 --> 2:38:20.860]  in people above 65 no one knows why they're all having heart attacks when the CDC's own
[2:38:20.860 --> 2:38:25.660]  documents in October 2000 said that it was going to cause heart attacks and blood clots
[2:38:25.660 --> 2:38:30.340]  they are literally murdering us and all of this was just the training wheels the beta
[2:38:30.340 --> 2:38:35.300]  test for the next operation so folks your life is in the balance you better wake people
[2:38:35.300 --> 2:38:38.780]  up you better wake up your church you better wake up your businesses you better wake up
[2:38:38.780 --> 2:38:42.820]  perfect strangers because it is only going to get worse that we look at all these issues
[2:38:42.820 --> 2:38:46.740]  alone they're going to win but if we know that it's all part of a larger global operation
[2:38:46.740 --> 2:38:50.900]  and fight back with the truth and fight back by spotlighting these people it's game over
[2:38:50.900 --> 2:38:55.020]  info wars.com is the front line of the fight for humanity tomorrow's news today I love
[2:38:55.020 --> 2:38:59.220]  you all and I love the crew I'm going to hand this back over to you my friend Alex Jones

[2:39:06.940 --> 2:39:10.860]  and let me just in fact let me just stop myself before I start waxing here and let me just
[2:39:10.860 --> 2:39:15.060]  really focus and cover the rest of this news and get to the rest of these video clips that
[2:39:15.060 --> 2:39:19.620]  are on my desk because they're way more important we're all in this together our souls are connected
[2:39:19.620 --> 2:39:25.820]  are our unlimited consciousness are our infinite experiences it's all connected we all know
[2:39:25.820 --> 2:39:30.900]  what's going on so let me just highlight some of the other news stories now people are starting
[2:39:30.900 --> 2:39:35.220]  to get it that pretty much everything the establishment tells you is a lie here's Kurt
[2:39:35.220 --> 2:39:40.700]  Schilling Major League Baseball Hall of Famer they lied about the dossier Russia Ukraine
[2:39:40.700 --> 2:39:45.580]  Kavanaugh small at Avenatti Hunter Biden Joe Biden Rittenhouse George Floyd Michael
[2:39:45.580 --> 2:39:51.780]  Brown gender is fluid systemic racism America was founded in 1619 BLM Antifa and now they
[2:39:51.780 --> 2:39:57.260]  have a committee to get at the truth F them good for Kurt Schilling because folks I'm
[2:39:57.260 --> 2:40:01.260]  telling you you come out as a conservative American patriot now in the sports world you
[2:40:01.260 --> 2:40:06.300]  get tarred and feathered just ask Jack del Rio here's another one Jason Meister he goes
[2:40:06.300 --> 2:40:11.980]  on Fox News other places as a commentator J6 was not an insurrection Trump did not collude
[2:40:11.980 --> 2:40:16.220]  with Russia Kavanaugh wasn't a gang rapist small it isn't a victim of a hate crime COVID
[2:40:16.220 --> 2:40:20.420]  didn't originate in a wet market Rittenhouse isn't a white supremacist Biden didn't get
[2:40:20.420 --> 2:40:24.700]  81 million votes men can't get pregnant Hunter Biden's laptop is real so again people are
[2:40:24.700 --> 2:40:29.860]  just starting to realize now it's just the truth if a Democrat's talking a Democrat's
[2:40:29.860 --> 2:40:36.540]  lying and most of the mainstream media are just Democrat activists at this point let's
[2:40:36.540 --> 2:40:42.340]  get to some of these other video clips here if I can in the last two minutes let's go
[2:40:42.340 --> 2:40:50.580]  to oh this is a wild moment on MSNBC Rachel Maddow unintentionally tells the truth last
[2:40:50.580 --> 2:40:55.140]  night in clip 13 I'll explain what I mean by unintentionally first here is the clip
[2:40:55.140 --> 2:40:59.860]  just the key point that yes there was a pro-Trump rally at which the president spoke and you
[2:40:59.860 --> 2:41:03.180]  can we can absolutely talk about all the things the president said there but the idea that
[2:41:03.180 --> 2:41:08.340]  that rally is the thing that got out of hand and that somehow resulted in the breaching
[2:41:08.340 --> 2:41:11.900]  of the capital that rally was very far from the capital and the people who as you say
[2:41:11.900 --> 2:41:16.940]  did the initial breach that allowed everybody else to come in they never even went to that
[2:41:16.940 --> 2:41:24.580]  rally so that's Rachel Maddow accidentally telling a truth through a lie do you understand
[2:41:24.580 --> 2:41:30.740]  what I'm saying Rachel Maddow is lying she's she's she's lying trying to build up the big
[2:41:30.740 --> 2:41:35.820]  narrative that oh people were plotting and planning an insurrection in a coup and all
[2:41:35.820 --> 2:41:39.100]  of this other stuff I mean maybe QAnon was you should find out who that is I think we're
[2:41:39.100 --> 2:41:42.980]  all curious except you guys you were probably running it maybe Rachel Maddow's QAnon but
[2:41:42.980 --> 2:41:49.300]  see she's lying saying oh it was all pre-coordinated all pre-scripted but then she accidentally
[2:41:49.300 --> 2:41:54.100]  tells the truth in a lie that hey there's no way Trump was running the thing he was on
[2:41:54.100 --> 2:42:00.340]  the stage talking and the thing was already going on at the capital oops Rachel Maddow
[2:42:00.340 --> 2:42:07.300]  accidentally tells the truth through a lie that's a pretty wild one right there but there
[2:42:07.300 --> 2:42:13.260]  you have it yeah you know I've got all these headlines here but we've pretty much covered
[2:42:13.260 --> 2:42:19.260]  it all as far as the events from last night and everything else leading up to it Republicans
[2:42:19.260 --> 2:42:27.380]  pledge a probe into January 6 investigation now folks this is the key factor on saving
[2:42:27.380 --> 2:42:32.420]  this country country peacefully and politically this is the key factor is having good members
[2:42:32.420 --> 2:42:36.860]  of Congress obviously that's only gonna happen in the Republican Party now that push back

[2:44:06.140 --> 2:44:11.180]  of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil
[2:44:11.180 --> 2:44:15.100]  better than watermelon coffee and yeah we buy from the little farmers that you know the
[2:44:15.100 --> 2:44:18.820]  media calls communist but really they're just a commune and whatever the point is is that
[2:44:18.820 --> 2:44:22.220]  it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take
[2:44:22.220 --> 2:44:25.700]  over so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what 14
[2:44:25.700 --> 2:44:28.780]  years and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another
[2:44:28.780 --> 2:44:32.940]  name for about 50% more per pound and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're

[2:48:22.220 --> 2:48:27.420]  let's just hit some of this news on my desk without any rhyme or reason to just make sure
[2:48:27.420 --> 2:48:35.420]  we've covered it here john hassan has gone out and and done in a look at how much news
[2:48:35.420 --> 2:48:39.500]  coverage the new york times the washington post and joe biden gave or mentioned her
[2:48:39.500 --> 2:48:45.340]  coverage that joe biden gave to the governor whitmer kidnapping attempt which was an fbi
[2:48:45.340 --> 2:48:53.300]  set up and that versus the cavanaugh assassination attempt which was organic democrat terrorism
[2:48:53.300 --> 2:48:58.180]  and you can see it there on the screen new york times covered the whitmer kidnapping
[2:48:58.180 --> 2:49:03.860]  attempt in the two days following that with plenty of stories you can see there on the
[2:49:03.860 --> 2:49:08.940]  search results lots of stories there only two stories only two stories on the cavanaugh
[2:49:08.940 --> 2:49:15.740]  assassination attempt from the new york times let's just say more than triple that on the
[2:49:15.740 --> 2:49:22.460]  whitmer fbi set up washington post same deal three stories though and washington post had
[2:49:22.460 --> 2:49:27.500]  three stories on the cavanaugh assassination attempt but again more than double on the
[2:49:27.500 --> 2:49:35.460]  fbi set up entrapment of the governor whitmer kidnapping attempt and then joe biden yes biden
[2:49:35.460 --> 2:49:42.300]  did of course comment on the fake fbi set up of capturing governor whitmer nothing on
[2:49:42.300 --> 2:49:48.780]  the cavanaugh assassination attempt nothing from our president but we did hear from joe
[2:49:48.780 --> 2:49:55.140]  biden today he's doing the blame game as he normally is to try to save his ratings from
[2:49:55.140 --> 2:50:01.460]  reaching the 20s 20th percentile which they may reach by the end of june folks look out
[2:50:01.460 --> 2:50:15.860]  for that but here's joe biden playing the blame game in clip 24 today i'd like to speak about
[2:50:15.860 --> 2:50:21.980]  my top economic priority fighting inflation i understand americans are anxious and they're
[2:50:21.980 --> 2:50:27.660]  anxious for good reason i was raising the household when the price of gasoline rose precipitously
[2:50:27.660 --> 2:50:32.460]  it was the discussion at the table it made a difference and food prices went up but we've
[2:50:32.460 --> 2:50:39.340]  never seen anything like putin's tax on both food and gas putin's tax on food and gas no
[2:50:39.340 --> 2:50:44.780]  biden literally shut down the oil pipelines in the west and then opened the oil pipelines
[2:50:44.780 --> 2:50:57.340]  to putin in the european east the food tax by putin i mean folks this is just incredible
[2:50:57.340 --> 2:51:04.580]  biden blaming this on putin even though all of it started as soon as biden got in just
[2:51:04.580 --> 2:51:10.140]  wow but here's what he's talking about well don't worry the mainstream news is covering
[2:51:10.140 --> 2:51:14.780]  for him this was a syndicated story by the way so i have the print out here from fortune
[2:51:14.780 --> 2:51:20.260]  magazine but it's on yahoo it's everywhere they syndicated it what causes a recession
[2:51:20.260 --> 2:51:26.180]  maybe it's you and how grumpy you are about the economy oh so prices go up you can't afford
[2:51:26.180 --> 2:51:31.980]  anymore you get grumpy that's your fault according to will daniel and fortune magazine and everywhere
[2:51:31.980 --> 2:51:37.180]  else yahoo news that syndicated this story it's your fault it's putin's fault no i mean
[2:51:37.180 --> 2:51:41.660]  that's like biden saying i'm gonna do everything i can to stop the democrats you're saying wait
[2:51:41.660 --> 2:51:45.780]  you are a democrat i'm gonna do everything i can to stop inflation wait you are causing
[2:51:45.780 --> 2:51:52.580]  the inflation avocado prices hit record high supply chain crisis the latest crisis america
[2:51:52.580 --> 2:51:55.940]  now has a nationwide shortage of tampons it might have something to do with the democrats
[2:51:55.940 --> 2:52:04.500]  putting them in boys bathrooms now u.s inflation jumps 8.6 percent in may that is a huge number
[2:52:04.500 --> 2:52:08.380]  i mean again the trend just continues it's like five to ten percent every month the inflation
[2:52:08.380 --> 2:52:13.820]  goes up it's not stopping it's getting worse britain's food supply at risk uh michigan police
[2:52:13.820 --> 2:52:18.500]  say they won't respond to 911 calls because they can't afford gas but it's your fault
[2:52:18.500 --> 2:52:24.620]  it's putin's fault don't you see no it's the same dirty rotten liars that are destroying
[2:52:24.620 --> 2:52:30.140]  this country it's it's their fault just like a pretty much everything is sadly and they
[2:52:30.140 --> 2:52:34.540]  really like stealing elections because they can't win them legitimately tell me how this
[2:52:34.540 --> 2:52:41.580]  sounds to you supreme court okay is counting on dated mail-in ballots in pennsylvania on
[2:52:41.580 --> 2:52:47.260]  dated so you want to vote for biden in the 2020 presidential election sure go ahead
[2:52:47.260 --> 2:52:54.460]  right now tomorrow if you want on dated unbelievable and a supreme court justice said it could
[2:52:54.460 --> 2:53:01.100]  well affect the outcome of the fall elections oh you don't say the mail-in drop boxes oh
[2:53:01.100 --> 2:53:10.860]  2000 mules have you seen it i can't wait till 2000 mules gets its prime time media coverage
[2:53:10.860 --> 2:53:15.380]  with all the mass media push and marketing of it and then on all every cable news network
[2:53:15.380 --> 2:53:19.820]  on prime time news are we gonna have that how do you think that would go i bet ratings
[2:53:19.820 --> 2:53:24.060]  for that would be big do you think the democrats would allow that though do you think the mainstream
[2:53:24.060 --> 2:53:28.820]  media would allow that though probably not by the way i don't have time for it today
[2:53:28.820 --> 2:53:35.820]  but i want to let you know guys and let's put i want to put two videos today on the
[2:53:35.820 --> 2:53:42.300]  alex jones channel on band dot video guys and that's gonna be clip six and clip eleven
[2:53:42.300 --> 2:53:46.380]  let me explain these videos i don't have the time to play them today but it's definitely

[2:53:50.820 --> 2:53:55.940]  jones channel the first one is and i watched this last night and i gotta say brandon fellows
[2:53:55.940 --> 2:54:02.700]  is in good spirits for a man in his position to shoot this documentary but he did it he
[2:54:02.700 --> 2:54:08.380]  did a great job and he lets you know what it's like inside the dc gitmo folks secret
[2:54:08.380 --> 2:54:14.940]  video recordings leaks from inside the whole dc gitmo first footage released inside the
[2:54:14.940 --> 2:54:23.260]  cells of january six defendants that's brandon fellows again i how he's in such good spirits
[2:54:23.260 --> 2:54:27.500]  honestly probably just knowing he's talking to someone through the cameras probably what
[2:54:27.500 --> 2:54:32.180]  put him in such good spirits for the first time doing in ten months so we're gonna put
[2:54:32.180 --> 2:54:42.820]  that at the alex jones channel and the title will be something along footage inside dc
[2:54:42.820 --> 2:54:48.900]  gitmo shows horrible treatment of j6 defendants or something like that folks you're gonna want
[2:54:48.900 --> 2:54:53.120]  to watch this video now if you've been listening to me for a while you may recall after the
[2:54:53.120 --> 2:54:58.700]  democrats held me in a jail cell in dc i came on air after that and i said i don't know
[2:54:58.700 --> 2:55:06.300]  how the standards in these jail cells are legal because i was i was kept in those jail cells
[2:55:06.300 --> 2:55:13.100]  in january of 2020 if you recall for standing in the capital legally and lawfully you may
[2:55:13.100 --> 2:55:17.260]  remember that you had a bunch of trump supporter or excuse me yet a bunch of trump haters doing
[2:55:17.260 --> 2:55:24.940]  a demonstration in there i believe that was on a thursday you had a bunch of trump haters
[2:55:24.940 --> 2:55:29.780]  doing a big demonstration about 40 of them inside the capital on a thursday i went in
[2:55:29.780 --> 2:55:36.140]  there the day after and and simply had a piece of tape over my mouth that said censored and
[2:55:36.140 --> 2:55:41.500]  i got arrested for it and they kept me in dc gitmo for a night and i told you how bad
[2:55:41.500 --> 2:55:45.340]  those facilities were i couldn't believe they were legal this just sheds even more light
[2:55:45.340 --> 2:55:49.220]  on it i watched it for the first time last night folks you gotta see this you gotta share
[2:55:49.220 --> 2:55:54.380]  it it's just honestly it's heartbreaking and then another one i'm gonna upload is lieutenant
[2:55:54.380 --> 2:55:59.540]  governor of north carolina speaking at the nr a you know racist bigot hate monger joy
[2:55:59.540 --> 2:56:03.780]  bayhar says that when black people get guns then we'll ban them the most racist statement
[2:56:03.780 --> 2:56:09.220]  i've ever seen on live tv that's just legitimately racist and not satire or comedy i wonder how
[2:56:09.220 --> 2:56:13.300]  she feels about mark robinson's speech we're gonna put that on banned out video as well
[2:56:13.300 --> 2:56:18.100]  that's just such a powerful speech it needs to be spread far and wide so those things
[2:56:18.100 --> 2:56:26.060]  are coming but uh... here's a couple other things as we head into the break the city
[2:56:26.060 --> 2:56:31.940]  of miami this is ken russell who's working with the city of miami that i mean these people
[2:56:31.940 --> 2:56:37.780]  are so dumb at city of miami commission we just created a voluntary gun buyback program
[2:56:37.780 --> 2:56:44.700]  through miami pd that will take guns off the streets and send them to ukraine to help against
[2:56:44.700 --> 2:56:49.460]  the russian invasion this could be a model for police departments across the country
[2:56:49.460 --> 2:56:53.820]  so again you the american law abiding citizen you don't get a gun but then they send them
[2:56:53.820 --> 2:56:58.020]  into ukraine where they almost certainly end up on the black market you really think this
[2:56:58.020 --> 2:57:03.060]  is taking guns off the streets how dumb must you be how many people are going to sell the
[2:57:03.060 --> 2:57:09.260]  gun to you and then go by go out and buy a nicer one how many how many criminals are
[2:57:09.260 --> 2:57:14.820]  are are selling their guns this is ridiculous it's not going to stop anything you want
[2:57:14.820 --> 2:57:19.260]  to do a gun buyback program fine you want to send a new ukraine ukraine okay fine it
[2:57:19.260 --> 2:57:23.860]  just shows how the double standard american get a gun but oh see it's like george tk the
[2:57:23.860 --> 2:57:29.500]  other day says oh if uh oh if ar-15s work so well why don't we send more to ukraine
[2:57:29.500 --> 2:57:37.460]  oh you figured it out oh you stupid liberal figured it out the gun stopped here the gun
[2:57:37.460 --> 2:57:44.220]  stopped the bad guy the new york governor signs off on new gun laws requiring permits

[3:00:04.580 --> 3:00:26.660]  in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence
[3:00:26.660 --> 3:00:33.780]  whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex we must also be alert to
[3:00:33.780 --> 3:00:41.900]  the equal and opposite danger that public policy could become the captive of a scientific
[3:00:41.900 --> 3:00:46.980]  technological elite and we'll be faced with equally consequential decisions in the 21st
[3:00:46.980 --> 3:00:53.220]  century can a microscopic tag be implanted in a person's body to track is every movement
[3:00:53.220 --> 3:00:58.900]  there's actual discussion about that you will rule on that mark my words before your tenure
[3:00:58.900 --> 3:01:04.980]  is over can brain scans be used to determine whether a person is inclined toward criminality
[3:01:04.980 --> 3:01:19.420]  or violent behavior you will rule on that if you have enough data on a person especially
[3:01:19.420 --> 3:01:28.220]  biometric data and if you have enough computing power you can understand that person better
[3:01:28.220 --> 3:01:35.300]  than the person understand himself or herself and then you can control this person manipulate
[3:01:35.300 --> 3:01:40.460]  them and make decisions for them can you imagine certain 10 years when we are sitting
[3:01:40.460 --> 3:01:48.900]  here we have an implant in our brains and I can immediately feel because you all will
[3:01:48.900 --> 3:01:56.540]  have implants people will literally be part of a network all the bodies all the brains
[3:01:56.540 --> 3:02:03.940]  will be connected together to a network and you won't be able to survive if you are disconnected
[3:02:03.940 --> 3:02:10.540]  from the net they are taking over many of the unskilled and possibly some of the skilled
[3:02:10.540 --> 3:02:16.140]  activities then there will be people for whom there is seems to be society won't have much
[3:02:16.140 --> 3:02:22.500]  use for these people we need to accept that there will be some pain in the process I think
[3:02:22.500 --> 3:02:26.220]  we're going to have to think about a recalibration of a whole range of human rights that are
[3:02:26.220 --> 3:02:31.220]  playing out online individual carbon footprint tracker many of these things will be built
[3:02:31.220 --> 3:02:38.300]  directly into our bodies that's a hostile corporate takeover of your body and a digital
[3:02:38.300 --> 3:02:43.820]  surveillance censorship dictatorship president Eisenhower tried to warn us about this years
[3:02:43.820 --> 3:02:53.340]  ago the hostile takeover of a scientific technological elite say provide much more powerful intelligence
[3:02:53.340 --> 3:03:02.140]  for decision making can a microscopic tag be implanted in a person's body to track his
[3:03:02.140 --> 3:03:11.060]  every movement you will rule the next phase is the surveillance going under our skin now
[3:03:11.060 --> 3:03:16.020]  that we've cracked the code of life it will not take much longer before we can start to
[3:03:16.020 --> 3:03:26.300]  play God the new powers that we are gaining now especially the powers of biotechnology
[3:03:26.300 --> 3:03:34.020]  and artificial intelligence are really going to transform us into guns it's a total complete
[3:03:34.020 --> 3:03:43.700]  AI takeover of every fast human life like a Ferrari and others have been saying given
[3:03:43.700 --> 3:03:50.660]  all the technological developments it might be feasible even easy to support people even
[3:03:50.660 --> 3:03:55.940]  if they don't work to give them a universal basic income to give them enough food enough
[3:03:55.940 --> 3:04:03.900]  medicine and so forth the big question is meaning what will they do all day and one of the answers
[3:04:03.900 --> 3:04:09.740]  is that they will just play computer games all day our virtual reality games they will
[3:04:09.740 --> 3:04:17.740]  spend more and more time playing virtual reality games that will give them much more excitement
[3:04:17.740 --> 3:04:25.340]  and emotional engagement than anything in the real world outside but what I see is a huge
[3:04:25.340 --> 3:04:31.140]  disruption that is before we get to the world that Yuba and this is his description of the
[3:04:31.140 --> 3:04:37.300]  future there's going to be a complete destabilization of the human condition and of human society
[3:04:37.300 --> 3:04:39.660]  this is not going to happen quietly

[3:06:39.860 --> 3:06:46.660]  the way she's she's lying but it's it's the truth depending on how you perceive it from
[3:06:46.660 --> 3:06:51.460]  Hillary Clinton last night the people involved in the criminal conspiracy to overturn the
[3:06:51.460 --> 3:06:58.380]  will of Americans voters which culminated in the attempted coup of January 6 must be held
[3:06:58.380 --> 3:07:03.860]  accountable are you talking about the people that stole the election Hillary remember is
[3:07:03.860 --> 3:07:13.380]  that what you know because she's right it's amazing in it it's just incredible some other
[3:07:13.380 --> 3:07:20.660]  things here oh yeah a democrat just tried to assassinate a supreme court justice but that's
[3:07:20.660 --> 3:07:25.420]  not stopping the democrats from encouraging more violence like Michelle Obama Michelle
[3:07:25.420 --> 3:07:31.180]  Obama urges abortion right supporters to double down ahead of rovers wade ruling folks they
[3:07:31.180 --> 3:07:35.860]  must know by the way we still don't know the leaker the leaker will be protected as a democrat
[3:07:35.860 --> 3:07:41.860]  they must know that I guess rovers wade is gonna be overturned which really just means
[3:07:41.860 --> 3:07:45.140]  it's gonna go down to the states level so nobody's even banning abortion so that's another
[3:07:45.140 --> 3:07:51.540]  democrat party lie nobody's banning abortion it's going to the state levels but oh someone
[3:07:51.540 --> 3:07:55.340]  just tried to assassinate a supreme court justice Michelle Obama says double down on
[3:07:55.340 --> 3:07:59.900]  the protest yeah we need more people trying to kill supreme court justices is that what
[3:07:59.900 --> 3:08:04.380]  Michelle Obama is saying it would seem like it would certainly seem like a fossil they
[3:08:04.380 --> 3:08:10.580]  must know this decision and uh... boy oh boy can they really draw up a crowd of baby killers
[3:08:10.580 --> 3:08:14.900]  in a heartbeat that's an amazing thing and then you had a record attendance ladies and
[3:08:14.900 --> 3:08:20.060]  gentlemen record attendance at a wnba game because there were democrat protesters there
[3:08:20.060 --> 3:08:27.300]  topless pro-road protesters stormed the court at a wnba game and understanding ovation from
[3:08:27.300 --> 3:08:31.020]  the crowd as it says in the yahoo story uh... folks look i'm not trying to make fun of the
[3:08:31.020 --> 3:08:36.740]  wnba it's it's fine it's whatever i actually know a couple wnba players
[3:08:36.740 --> 3:08:41.940]  nobody goes their games they get like five hundred people per game in attendance and
[3:08:41.940 --> 3:08:50.260]  about fifty abortion activists bust to go to this wnba game where multiple women ran
[3:08:50.260 --> 3:08:52.140]  on the court topless
[3:08:52.140 --> 3:08:53.340]  let me ask this question
[3:08:53.340 --> 3:08:55.060]  why topless
[3:08:55.060 --> 3:09:00.260]  what is the what is the deal what is the deal with the topless thing
[3:09:00.260 --> 3:09:02.420]  why do they always have to be topless
[3:09:02.420 --> 3:09:04.460]  so they run on the court topless
[3:09:04.460 --> 3:09:07.860]  to support abortion okay that's what they do
[3:09:07.860 --> 3:09:11.740]  but they forgot to glue themselves to the court so they were quickly whisked away
[3:09:11.740 --> 3:09:15.340]  uh... it's the left they're getting more and more out of control but
[3:09:15.340 --> 3:09:19.580]  back to the liberal violence that we're experiencing do you remember this clip from
[3:09:19.580 --> 3:09:25.580]  Jen Psaki just about a month ago uh... as we're sitting here still
[3:09:25.580 --> 3:09:28.860]  thinking about another attempted democrat assassination
[3:09:28.860 --> 3:09:31.300]  another democrat tried to assassinate
[3:09:31.300 --> 3:09:33.020]  a uh...
[3:09:33.020 --> 3:09:35.860]  politician or government
[3:09:35.860 --> 3:09:36.940]  agent
[3:09:36.940 --> 3:09:40.860]  that's what the liberals do ever since the weather underground who inspired
[3:09:40.860 --> 3:09:45.820]  barack obama member this clip from Jen Psaki just a month ago in clip seven
[3:09:45.820 --> 3:09:50.380]  so i know that there's an outrage right now i guess about uh... protest that have
[3:09:50.380 --> 3:09:51.940]  been peaceful to date
[3:09:51.940 --> 3:09:54.620]  and we certainly continue to encourage that outside of
[3:09:54.620 --> 3:09:57.180]  judges homes and that's the president's position
[3:09:57.180 --> 3:09:58.260]  all
[3:09:58.260 --> 3:10:03.460]  you encourage it outside of justices homes that's the president's position
[3:10:03.460 --> 3:10:06.540]  all i guess now we know why the democrats and joe biden have said
[3:10:06.540 --> 3:10:07.900]  nothing about
[3:10:07.900 --> 3:10:11.780]  their guy going out to assassinate justice cavenal
[3:10:11.780 --> 3:10:14.860]  yes that's why they're not saying they're no they're saying they want more
[3:10:14.860 --> 3:10:18.620]  democrats i guess what justice cavenal dead
[3:10:18.620 --> 3:10:21.340]  and so then that brings us to a o c
[3:10:21.340 --> 3:10:24.140]  who's a known liar
[3:10:24.140 --> 3:10:26.700]  and this is interesting so
[3:10:26.700 --> 3:10:31.780]  there was proposed legislation to send extra security to supreme court justices
[3:10:31.780 --> 3:10:32.700]  houses
[3:10:32.700 --> 3:10:35.060]  because democrats are trying to murder them
[3:10:35.060 --> 3:10:38.860]  and so a bill was proposed to send extra security to their homes
[3:10:38.860 --> 3:10:41.180]  a o c actually voted against it
[3:10:41.180 --> 3:10:44.820]  and and listen to her logic this is hilarious
[3:10:44.820 --> 3:10:47.180]  in clip twenty three
[3:10:47.180 --> 3:10:50.380]  now i wake up this morning i start to hear murmurs that there's going to be an
[3:10:50.380 --> 3:10:51.740]  attempt to pass
[3:10:51.740 --> 3:10:55.780]  the supreme court supplemental protection bill
[3:10:55.780 --> 3:11:00.500]  the day after gun safety legislation for schools and kids and people
[3:11:00.500 --> 3:11:02.580]  uh... installed
[3:11:02.580 --> 3:11:06.460]  also we can pass protections for us
[3:11:06.460 --> 3:11:11.100]  and and here easily right but we can't pass protections for everyday people i
[3:11:11.100 --> 3:11:11.860]  think
[3:11:11.860 --> 3:11:14.380]  not
[3:11:14.380 --> 3:11:16.020]  folks
[3:11:16.020 --> 3:11:18.940]  if there was ever somebody with a zero iq
[3:11:18.940 --> 3:11:19.980]  i give you
[3:11:19.980 --> 3:11:21.180]  a o c
[3:11:21.180 --> 3:11:24.580]  now i'm more convinced than ever and i was never really a big proponent of the
[3:11:24.580 --> 3:11:28.500]  theory that she's just a paid actress i believe she's just a paid actress now
[3:11:28.500 --> 3:11:31.380]  but that's that's not the point here
[3:11:31.380 --> 3:11:33.820]  what does she say she says oh
[3:11:33.820 --> 3:11:38.740]  we can have protection but the citizens can't i think not
[3:11:38.740 --> 3:11:42.860]  you called for the defunding of police you're calling for the disarming of
[3:11:42.860 --> 3:11:45.420]  civilians while you get access
[3:11:45.420 --> 3:11:48.180]  to arm security
[3:11:48.180 --> 3:11:52.500]  what clown world do these people
[3:11:52.500 --> 3:11:55.420]  a o c votes to defund the police
[3:11:55.420 --> 3:11:59.860]  votes to disarm american citizens has our security for herself funded by the
[3:11:59.860 --> 3:12:06.700]  taxpayer and then act like she's pro citizen protection
[3:12:06.700 --> 3:12:07.900]  i just
[3:12:07.900 --> 3:12:10.300]  and see that's the problem is
[3:12:10.300 --> 3:12:12.940]  when a o c claims that she's been raped
[3:12:12.940 --> 3:12:14.900]  i don't want to just disbelieve her
[3:12:14.900 --> 3:12:17.900]  but how could i not she's a known liar
[3:12:17.900 --> 3:12:21.220]  and now she's claiming that she she has been raped
[3:12:21.220 --> 3:12:24.500]  you know a o c claims to be a rape victim it's just how convenient now i
[3:12:24.500 --> 3:12:25.820]  guess
[3:12:25.820 --> 3:12:28.520]  i guess it's a good thing to be a rape victim now
[3:12:28.520 --> 3:12:31.220]  uh... and so now i didn't know i didn't realize she claimed to be a rape
[3:12:31.220 --> 3:12:33.180]  victim and she says
[3:12:33.180 --> 3:12:36.260]  look at this footage lauren bobert was tweeting the speaker's location as this
[3:12:36.260 --> 3:12:41.220]  all was happening when i spoke of my fear of being raped again what she was
[3:12:41.220 --> 3:12:42.860]  raped who raped her
[3:12:42.860 --> 3:12:46.260]  while locked in my office bathroom
[3:12:46.260 --> 3:12:49.340]  uh... she was mocked well now wait a second
[3:12:49.340 --> 3:12:53.620]  wait a second we have the footage of a o c's office
[3:12:53.620 --> 3:12:55.000]  during
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:12:56.260]  the uh...
[3:12:56.260 --> 3:12:58.340]  the january sixth
[3:12:58.340 --> 3:13:03.380]  invasion of the capital guys and so let's roll that here it is in clip five
[3:13:03.380 --> 3:13:08.260]  this was the journey that my life was
[3:13:08.260 --> 3:13:12.180]  i felt that things were going to be okay
[3:13:12.180 --> 3:13:13.820]  fake crime
[3:13:13.820 --> 3:13:16.100]  this is all this is all an act
[3:13:16.100 --> 3:13:18.500]  she's a total faker an actress
[3:13:18.500 --> 3:13:21.100]  uh... and that
[3:13:21.100 --> 3:13:23.300]  i had fulfilled my purpose
[3:13:23.300 --> 3:13:27.220]  half of weekend close to half of the house nearly dying
[3:13:27.220 --> 3:13:28.500]  on wednesday
[3:13:28.500 --> 3:13:31.420]  you have all of those thoughts
[3:13:31.420 --> 3:13:33.260]  uh...
[3:13:33.260 --> 3:13:36.060]  where you know at the end of your life
[3:13:36.060 --> 3:13:39.380]  and all of these thoughts come rushing to you
[3:13:39.380 --> 3:13:40.620]  and
[3:13:40.620 --> 3:13:41.900]  uh...
[3:13:41.900 --> 3:13:45.700]  that's what happened to a lot of us on wednesday
[3:13:45.700 --> 3:13:48.220]  uh...
[3:13:48.220 --> 3:13:49.260]  and
[3:13:49.260 --> 3:13:50.540]  i thought i
[3:13:50.540 --> 3:13:52.140]  i did not think
[3:13:52.140 --> 3:13:55.620]  i did not know if i was going to make it to the end of that day life
[3:13:55.620 --> 3:13:58.780]  now again for audio listeners guys just give me the b-roll there on the screen
[3:13:58.780 --> 3:14:00.260]  again for audio listeners

[3:14:03.420 --> 3:14:06.980]  live footage from aoc's office right there on the screen
[3:14:06.980 --> 3:14:09.140]  where there's hundreds of people gathered
[3:14:09.140 --> 3:14:12.740]  no violence no panic no danger
[3:14:12.740 --> 3:14:15.300]  and she claims she was going to be killed and raped

[3:16:44.820 --> 3:16:48.620]  we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to
[3:16:48.620 --> 3:16:52.900]  take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother i thank you so

[3:17:11.820 --> 3:17:15.100]  the film proves how the deep state democrats
[3:17:15.100 --> 3:17:16.780]  stole the twenty twenty election
[3:17:16.780 --> 3:17:19.380]  and how they're planning to do it
[3:17:19.380 --> 3:17:22.580]  now ladies and gentlemen with all the censorship going on it is critical to

[3:20:02.180 --> 3:20:09.180]  it's alex jones
[3:20:12.380 --> 3:20:15.540]  welcome back to the alex joneshaw under guest host jay dyer
[3:20:15.540 --> 3:20:17.220]  of jays analysis
[3:20:17.220 --> 3:20:19.020]  you know it's been about uh...
[3:20:19.020 --> 3:20:23.580]  probably six or seven months since on the fourth hour we covered anything related to
[3:20:23.580 --> 3:20:29.100]  hollywood and the industry and the arts and all of that we've focused so heavily on
[3:20:29.100 --> 3:20:30.620]  geopolitical texts
[3:20:30.620 --> 3:20:32.140]  the writings of the elite
[3:20:32.140 --> 3:20:36.540]  uh... if you go back into the band of video archives in the last two years you'll find
[3:20:36.540 --> 3:20:39.980]  many many many lectures from those writings that we've done
[3:20:39.980 --> 3:20:43.780]  today i want to return to something uh... that i wrote my two books on which is the
[3:20:43.780 --> 3:20:45.460]  influence of
[3:20:45.460 --> 3:20:50.100]  propaganda in film and literature
[3:20:50.100 --> 3:20:54.460]  what recently occurred was as i'm sure many of you know the fourth
[3:20:54.460 --> 3:20:57.820]  season of stranger things stranger things is the
[3:20:57.820 --> 3:21:02.700]  uh... wildly popular netflix series which took off
[3:21:02.700 --> 3:21:05.860]  uh... four or five years ago maybe six years ago
[3:21:05.860 --> 3:21:09.900]  as a nostalgia piece harkening back to the nineteen eighties
[3:21:09.900 --> 3:21:14.100]  and what's interesting about the show isn't playing on nostalgia and all that
[3:21:14.100 --> 3:21:17.220]  kind of stuff i mean i think we're kind of getting bored with that i mean it
[3:21:17.220 --> 3:21:21.060]  basically all movies i mean drastic part just came out and
[3:21:21.060 --> 3:21:23.100]  once again we have
[3:21:23.100 --> 3:21:26.860]  uh... you know basically just regurgitating the same plots the same
[3:21:26.860 --> 3:21:28.540]  narrative this is the same
[3:21:28.540 --> 3:21:30.860]  oddities once again we have jeff
[3:21:30.860 --> 3:21:34.580]  goldblum uh... he's there uh... doing the
[3:21:34.580 --> 3:21:38.700]  the chaos mathematician uh... stick over and over and over i mean how many times
[3:21:38.700 --> 3:21:40.980]  we have to see the same things
[3:21:40.980 --> 3:21:43.040]  in these big series well
[3:21:43.040 --> 3:21:46.100]  what was interesting about stranger things wasn't so much all of the
[3:21:46.100 --> 3:21:49.180]  archetypal repetitive
[3:21:49.180 --> 3:21:49.980]  eighties
[3:21:49.980 --> 3:21:51.220]  arcana
[3:21:51.220 --> 3:21:54.900]  but the propaganda that they interjected into
[3:21:54.900 --> 3:21:58.300]  not just the whole series but particularly seasons three and four so
[3:21:58.300 --> 3:22:00.420]  if you don't recall just to kind of recap
[3:22:00.420 --> 3:22:04.340]  the series uh... takes place in a small indiana town
[3:22:04.340 --> 3:22:06.060]  in the early eighties
[3:22:06.060 --> 3:22:09.980]  uh... in the midst of the cold war we have explicit references to
[3:22:09.980 --> 3:22:12.060]  the nuclear threat of the cold war
[3:22:12.060 --> 3:22:16.580]  and the the plot centers around a secret program at a
[3:22:16.580 --> 3:22:18.340]  uh... department of energy
[3:22:18.340 --> 3:22:20.740]  facility in this small town
[3:22:20.740 --> 3:22:25.180]  what we find out is that the part uh... the department of energy cover there
[3:22:25.180 --> 3:22:27.660]  is really a mind control
[3:22:27.660 --> 3:22:30.780]  tapping into the next dimension seren type of thing
[3:22:30.780 --> 3:22:34.860]  so it gets weirder and weirder as the series progresses but initially we
[3:22:34.860 --> 3:22:39.220]  have season one focusing explicitly on the mkltra programs
[3:22:39.220 --> 3:22:42.340]  it even comes up in the series is explicitly mentioned when some of the
[3:22:42.340 --> 3:22:44.740]  characters start doing research into
[3:22:44.740 --> 3:22:48.580]  why uh... these bizarre events are occurring in this town we have missing
[3:22:48.580 --> 3:22:50.020]  children
[3:22:50.020 --> 3:22:53.300]  taking place in the eighties
[3:22:53.300 --> 3:22:54.540]  in season one
[3:22:54.540 --> 3:22:58.500]  uh... just to summarize and again as sure as who most people have seen and i'm
[3:22:58.500 --> 3:23:01.660]  not going to go into detail to details about the plot but
[3:23:01.660 --> 3:23:04.380]  you have this figure who's sort of the handler to the children that he's
[3:23:04.380 --> 3:23:07.460]  experimenting on and he's kind of a composite of
[3:23:07.460 --> 3:23:12.460]  uh... maybe timothy leary or doctors uh... john c lily or jose delgado and
[3:23:12.460 --> 3:23:14.020]  for those that don't recall
[3:23:14.020 --> 3:23:18.100]  those are prominent mkltra figures doctors who were really involved in the
[3:23:18.100 --> 3:23:19.220]  program
[3:23:19.220 --> 3:23:22.060]  perhaps even dr uan cameron uh... who
[3:23:22.060 --> 3:23:26.780]  were directly involved in testing experimenting on children
[3:23:26.780 --> 3:23:30.580]  especially in the case of dr john c lily he mentions this in his book
[3:23:30.580 --> 3:23:34.180]  programming and met a programming in the human bio computer
[3:23:34.180 --> 3:23:36.500]  and the idea was that if we could
[3:23:36.500 --> 3:23:40.180]  maybe kickstart evolution if we if we could uh... even at the expense of
[3:23:40.180 --> 3:23:44.780]  abusing the youth and using children or even giving them lsd in many cases
[3:23:44.780 --> 3:23:48.980]  cursor spur on the next stage of human evolution
[3:23:48.980 --> 3:23:52.900]  and i i don't know for sure but i speculate that this had to do with
[3:23:52.900 --> 3:23:54.100]  picking out
[3:23:54.100 --> 3:23:57.700]  profiling high iq children particularly gifted children
[3:23:57.700 --> 3:24:00.460]  and sing if they were able to uh...
[3:24:00.460 --> 3:24:03.060]  you know kickstart or or tap into
[3:24:03.060 --> 3:24:06.140]  the creative process of high iq children
[3:24:06.140 --> 3:24:10.140]  uh... or creatively gifted children and then try to weaponize that
[3:24:10.140 --> 3:24:13.940]  and quite a few tv shows have capitalized on this and if you follow my
[3:24:13.940 --> 3:24:15.180]  work you know that
[3:24:15.180 --> 3:24:18.140]  i've delved into the research of people like uh... david mcgallin
[3:24:18.140 --> 3:24:22.340]  uh... people like douglas valentine in the phoenix program
[3:24:22.340 --> 3:24:27.100]  where we covered the programs of the c i had cooked up during particularly in vietnam
[3:24:27.100 --> 3:24:29.060]  uh... to create
[3:24:29.060 --> 3:24:30.380]  cannibal serial killers
[3:24:30.380 --> 3:24:31.300]  this is a real thing
[3:24:31.300 --> 3:24:33.420]  it's detailed in the phoenix program book
[3:24:33.420 --> 3:24:37.140]  uh... it was a real program how extensive it was we don't know
[3:24:37.140 --> 3:24:40.980]  likewise other programs such as dr thomas narrate of the navy had uh...
[3:24:40.980 --> 3:24:43.580]  discussed in uh... public interviews
[3:24:43.580 --> 3:24:46.300]  that the navy had their own separate program where they uh... sort of
[3:24:46.300 --> 3:24:47.980]  experimented with
[3:24:47.980 --> 3:24:50.100]  psychotics perverts
[3:24:50.100 --> 3:24:54.060]  psychos to sort of train them to become assassins and killers
[3:24:54.060 --> 3:24:57.580]  uh... tom o'neill has a recent book out that kind of hints that some of this
[3:24:57.580 --> 3:24:58.260]  where he
[3:24:58.260 --> 3:25:01.700]  details the uh... called chaos where he connects
[3:25:01.700 --> 3:25:06.060]  manson to various uh... perhaps mind control type of programs and so we know
[3:25:06.060 --> 3:25:07.980]  a lot of this is going on
[3:25:07.980 --> 3:25:10.140]  there are uh... quite a few
[3:25:10.140 --> 3:25:13.420]  hard details that we can pin down in these programs
[3:25:13.420 --> 3:25:16.620]  but as to who was in these programs of course that's up for
[3:25:16.620 --> 3:25:19.540]  uh... debate we don't know for sure uh... some of the serial killers for
[3:25:19.540 --> 3:25:21.180]  example did have
[3:25:21.180 --> 3:25:23.740]  uh... role to play in certain uh...
[3:25:23.740 --> 3:25:27.100]  uh... mind control program some of them were explicitly involved in mk ultra
[3:25:27.100 --> 3:25:28.620]  like the unabomber
[3:25:28.620 --> 3:25:33.220]  uh... we know that uh... david burkowitz in his military uh... time that he did
[3:25:33.220 --> 3:25:37.700]  experiment with lsd and then it did quote change his personality
[3:25:37.700 --> 3:25:41.220]  but as to whether they were specifically part of my control programs
[3:25:41.220 --> 3:25:44.500]  uh... the serial killer that is uh... that's up for some speculation but there
[3:25:44.500 --> 3:25:47.140]  are some details that suggest that especially
[3:25:47.140 --> 3:25:50.780]  the timing of a lot of serial killers being a station in vietnam
[3:25:50.780 --> 3:25:54.100]  and being given uh... assassin type training now
[3:25:54.100 --> 3:25:57.300]  back to stranger things uh... the reason this is relevant is that the show is
[3:25:57.300 --> 3:25:59.820]  explicitly playing upon
[3:25:59.820 --> 3:26:02.500]  the stanford research projects
[3:26:02.500 --> 3:26:07.700]  which dealt with tapping into and trying to weaponize occult practices
[3:26:07.700 --> 3:26:11.660]  remote viewing was one that according to declassified documents of project
[3:26:11.660 --> 3:26:13.380]  stargate and others
[3:26:13.380 --> 3:26:16.380]  uh... seem to have had the most degree of success
[3:26:16.380 --> 3:26:19.540]  uh... how again how far they took this we don't know and there's some other
[3:26:19.540 --> 3:26:20.620]  bizarre
[3:26:20.620 --> 3:26:25.300]  uh... documents of the sea i declassified dealing with studies into uh...
[3:26:25.300 --> 3:26:28.020]  uh... meditation
[3:26:28.020 --> 3:26:31.020]  uh... whether how real it is we don't know
[3:26:31.020 --> 3:26:35.540]  again it's speculative but it's odd that the show comes out and that it was so
[3:26:35.540 --> 3:26:37.220]  focused on
[3:26:37.220 --> 3:26:41.860]  the uh... abuse and experimentation on young children
[3:26:41.860 --> 3:26:45.300]  particularly the main character being the girl eleven who is uh... i think her
[3:26:45.300 --> 3:26:48.180]  name is significant uh... that there's they're given numbers
[3:26:48.180 --> 3:26:50.260]  her name she doesn't know her real name
[3:26:50.260 --> 3:26:53.780]  and there's other uh... you know ten other children in the program
[3:26:53.780 --> 3:26:58.020]  also given names as numbers eleven is significant we can think of events like
[3:26:58.020 --> 3:26:59.660]  nine eleven
[3:26:59.660 --> 3:27:02.740]  and by season four uh... we were uh... we that the
[3:27:02.740 --> 3:27:07.020]  for one that they the first child uh... who's the man that the young boy in the
[3:27:07.020 --> 3:27:07.820]  experiment
[3:27:07.820 --> 3:27:08.620]  uh... is
[3:27:08.620 --> 3:27:11.700]  sort of a nemesis that she has to square off against
[3:27:11.700 --> 3:27:14.820]  but what's really relevant is that
[3:27:14.820 --> 3:27:17.460]  taking place in a spiritual
[3:27:17.460 --> 3:27:21.940]  uh... world so there's there's a spiritual world known as the upside down
[3:27:21.940 --> 3:27:25.420]  where the government experimenters are trying to tap into
[3:27:25.420 --> 3:27:27.300]  whether trying to tap into this and
[3:27:27.300 --> 3:27:31.420]  again this is you know it's fiction it's highly speculative but we do know that
[3:27:31.420 --> 3:27:35.020]  during of the caz ex experimentation into
[3:27:35.020 --> 3:27:37.540]  uh... the occult through sanford research
[3:27:37.540 --> 3:27:40.460]  uh... through various microtrol programs you know about my doctor michael
[3:27:40.460 --> 3:27:42.580]  uh... carnal michael quinoa being involved
[3:27:42.580 --> 3:27:45.980]  uh... in writing the army's psychological warfare doctrine from mine
[3:27:45.980 --> 3:27:49.060]  waterside war he was also the founder of the satanic
[3:27:49.060 --> 3:27:51.060]  sacked known as the temple of sat
[3:27:51.060 --> 3:27:54.420]  we know that he was also involved in studying
[3:27:54.420 --> 3:27:59.660]  uh... the ufo uh... uh... aerial phenomena as well as studying elements of
[3:27:59.660 --> 3:28:00.940]  uh... in kaltra
[3:28:00.940 --> 3:28:04.700]  again to what degree he was involved in that speculation we don't know but
[3:28:04.700 --> 3:28:08.300]  uh... it there is a clear connection here between the military
[3:28:08.300 --> 3:28:09.300]  the pentagon
[3:28:09.300 --> 3:28:13.620]  intelligence agencies studying the occult at a high level
[3:28:13.620 --> 3:28:16.120]  and let's never forget the infamous
[3:28:16.120 --> 3:28:20.060]  minister ago it's right the john ronston tax that was turned into a
[3:28:20.060 --> 3:28:22.100]  movie with you know greger
[3:28:22.100 --> 3:28:23.420]  uh... george cloney
[3:28:23.420 --> 3:28:24.100]  et cetera
[3:28:24.100 --> 3:28:27.100]  and i'm really is full of references to this kind of
[3:28:27.100 --> 3:28:30.860]  uh... material right you have the all sing i throughout the film you have
[3:28:30.860 --> 3:28:35.020]  the uh... the attempt to tap into these uh... uh... higher dimensions and what not
[3:28:35.020 --> 3:28:37.260]  a lot of uh... lsd research
[3:28:37.260 --> 3:28:40.460]  now it's not successful in the film but it is referenced pretty significantly
[3:28:40.460 --> 3:28:41.380]  throughout
[3:28:41.380 --> 3:28:42.820]  the story
[3:28:42.820 --> 3:28:45.780]  and that is playing on the first earth battalion is playing on general
[3:28:45.780 --> 3:28:46.980]  stubble bind
[3:28:46.980 --> 3:28:48.880]  uh... who was part of that program
[3:28:48.880 --> 3:28:50.220]  and his research
[3:28:50.220 --> 3:28:53.220]  so we get back to go deeper in the strange things and look at what's going
[3:28:53.220 --> 3:28:56.660]  on this is the alex jones show don't go anywhere
[3:28:56.660 --> 3:29:00.260]  the globalist are making their move their great reset is here

[3:32:51.620 --> 3:32:54.860]  One of the most important things you can do is get ahead of inflation now because the
[3:32:54.860 --> 3:32:57.900]  inflation is just beginning.
[3:32:57.900 --> 3:33:07.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:07.700 --> 3:33:12.780]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:12.780 --> 3:33:15.740]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of JaysonAlsis.
[3:33:15.740 --> 3:33:21.740]  We're talking about Stranger Things, this weird, synchronicity-filled show that sort
[3:33:21.740 --> 3:33:26.940]  of parallels to the Cold War that we're experiencing now in terms of a new Cold War.
[3:33:26.940 --> 3:33:34.380]  So the show, of course, hence and harkens back to 1983, 4, 5, 6, 7, around in this time
[3:33:34.380 --> 3:33:40.660]  period when the wall was about to fall, supposedly the Cold War was coming to its end, and there
[3:33:40.660 --> 3:33:46.700]  were persistent fears of nuclear threats, Chernobyl, the mutual assured destruction.
[3:33:46.700 --> 3:33:52.580]  At any moment, we're going to be nuked very parallel to what's going on right now with
[3:33:52.580 --> 3:33:56.540]  the proxy war going on in Ukraine.
[3:33:56.540 --> 3:34:02.620]  Now the show doesn't explicitly reference anything occultic until we get to seasons
[3:34:02.620 --> 3:34:07.500]  3 and 4, where we bring in the serial killer narrative, which I'll get to that in a moment.
[3:34:07.500 --> 3:34:12.340]  But before we get to that, we have to point out that in season 1, the show initially revolves
[3:34:12.340 --> 3:34:15.900]  around Dungeons and Dragons, the role-playing game.
[3:34:15.900 --> 3:34:21.820]  And the children who are kind of the goonies type of, you know, troop of kids that go on
[3:34:21.820 --> 3:34:28.380]  their adventure, they initially invoke this entity from the beyond through playing Dungeons
[3:34:28.380 --> 3:34:34.020]  and Dragons and through this game, which deals with a lot of fantasy and whatnot.
[3:34:34.020 --> 3:34:39.820]  I personally think it's a harmless fantasy game, but it takes place right at the onset
[3:34:39.820 --> 3:34:46.260]  of the Satanic Panic, which was, you know, coming into fewer in the mid-80s, especially
[3:34:46.260 --> 3:34:54.100]  when TV shows like Oprah and Geraldo focused on both serial killers and Satanic cults,
[3:34:54.100 --> 3:34:55.700]  this leading to this panic.
[3:34:55.700 --> 3:35:01.380]  And a lot of the so-called Satanic cults and sects that were mentioned and discussed
[3:35:01.380 --> 3:35:06.100]  kind of turned out to be somewhat real, although in my view what happened was there was a lot
[3:35:06.100 --> 3:35:10.100]  of focus on this and sensationalism that made everybody think, oh, this isn't real.
[3:35:10.100 --> 3:35:11.900]  This is all hyped up and it's just made up.
[3:35:11.900 --> 3:35:19.580]  But no, in fact, there were real Satanic cults and some of the serial killers did have connections
[3:35:19.580 --> 3:35:20.580]  to the Satanic.
[3:35:20.580 --> 3:35:25.900]  I mean, in fact, in the Geraldo's famous series, I think he goes into discussing the serial
[3:35:25.900 --> 3:35:31.140]  killer Bobby Burdella, and Bobby Burdella was into Satanism and did have a Satanic
[3:35:31.140 --> 3:35:37.060]  cult, and that was connected to his murders, to the BDSM and so forth, that he was involved
[3:35:37.060 --> 3:35:38.700]  in these underground scenes.
[3:35:38.700 --> 3:35:43.580]  And this is something that we find as a pattern in a lot of these stories of the serial killers,
[3:35:43.580 --> 3:35:46.500]  which the media typically plays down.
[3:35:46.500 --> 3:35:48.340]  They don't talk about the cult element.
[3:35:48.340 --> 3:35:53.540]  They don't talk about other elements like accomplices and, you know, mind control,
[3:35:53.540 --> 3:35:56.620]  drugging, all these kinds of things are usually left out or played down.
[3:35:56.620 --> 3:35:58.700]  They always focus on it being the lone knot.
[3:35:58.700 --> 3:36:04.700]  They focus on it being these patterns that aren't always there or aren't really there.
[3:36:04.700 --> 3:36:05.700]  Right?
[3:36:05.700 --> 3:36:06.700]  Oh, he's just a lone crazy guy.
[3:36:06.700 --> 3:36:11.100]  He acted weird and they leave out the military training.
[3:36:11.100 --> 3:36:15.380]  They leave out the interest in Satanism and the occult.
[3:36:15.380 --> 3:36:20.100]  Again, this is present in so many of the serial killers that it's really implausible
[3:36:20.100 --> 3:36:21.100]  to think.
[3:36:21.100 --> 3:36:23.300]  It's really ridiculous to think that it has no connection.
[3:36:23.300 --> 3:36:28.300]  I mean, literally there's probably 24 of the most famous serial killers who express
[3:36:28.300 --> 3:36:34.620]  an avid interest in Satanism and the occult in ritual magic or some form or something
[3:36:34.620 --> 3:36:35.620]  like that.
[3:36:35.620 --> 3:36:39.260]  So to overlook that or to play that down is somewhat absurd.
[3:36:39.260 --> 3:36:45.820]  But in the show, it's presented as really not being anything serious in regard to the
[3:36:45.820 --> 3:36:46.820]  pop culture.
[3:36:46.820 --> 3:36:47.820]  And I would agree with that.
[3:36:47.820 --> 3:36:48.820]  Right?
[3:36:48.820 --> 3:36:51.020]  I mean, the show goes in the direction of pointing out that, wait a minute, there's something
[3:36:51.020 --> 3:36:56.860]  actually deeply satanic in a real global sense going on.
[3:36:56.860 --> 3:37:01.740]  But it's not really things that the media told everybody to focus on.
[3:37:01.740 --> 3:37:05.900]  This or that pop song, this or that game, Dungeons and Dragons, right?
[3:37:05.900 --> 3:37:10.740]  I mean, those things might in a very loose sense have fantasy elements.
[3:37:10.740 --> 3:37:18.500]  But is that really what was the satanic, so to speak, threat of the time period?
[3:37:18.500 --> 3:37:23.060]  And the show actually does make an interesting point in season four that the real satanic
[3:37:23.060 --> 3:37:29.900]  threat is whatever is going on at this meta geopolitical level that is engineering the
[3:37:29.900 --> 3:37:36.500]  Cold War to take us into some kind of dystopian demonic future.
[3:37:36.500 --> 3:37:39.060]  It's almost apocalyptic in the show.
[3:37:39.060 --> 3:37:42.220]  Now, again, I'm not saying that this is the end of the world.
[3:37:42.220 --> 3:37:45.900]  The apocalypse can also mean the end of an era.
[3:37:45.900 --> 3:37:46.900]  All right?
[3:37:46.900 --> 3:37:49.220]  So it doesn't necessarily have to be the end times.
[3:37:49.220 --> 3:37:50.220]  It could be, I don't know.
[3:37:50.220 --> 3:37:51.220]  Right?
[3:37:51.220 --> 3:37:52.220]  I'm not making that claim.
[3:37:52.220 --> 3:37:59.380]  The show is talking about a opening of the demonic that occurs not just through teenagers
[3:37:59.380 --> 3:38:04.420]  playing games, but rather the real opening of the demonic is occurring through high-level
[3:38:04.420 --> 3:38:13.460]  people in the government engineering a new era or a new Aeon based on their satanic philosophy.
[3:38:13.460 --> 3:38:15.140]  And it might not even be explicitly satanic.
[3:38:15.140 --> 3:38:21.460]  I mean, for example, the mind control handler character from the Pentagon in the show, he
[3:38:21.460 --> 3:38:26.420]  doesn't seem to be personally that nefarious, right?
[3:38:26.420 --> 3:38:32.020]  He thinks that he's working for the good of the country, fighting the Cold War of mastering
[3:38:32.020 --> 3:38:38.860]  these mind control techniques and the nuclear technology and so forth to fight the evil
[3:38:38.860 --> 3:38:39.860]  Russians, right?
[3:38:39.860 --> 3:38:41.020]  That's how he sees it.
[3:38:41.020 --> 3:38:46.020]  And so he thinks that the actions that he's taking are completely justified.
[3:38:46.020 --> 3:38:50.460]  And so even though it might not be pretty, it's necessary because of the global conflict,
[3:38:50.460 --> 3:38:51.460]  right?
[3:38:51.460 --> 3:38:52.460]  The global...
[3:38:52.460 --> 3:38:53.460]  The Cold War, right?
[3:38:53.460 --> 3:38:54.460]  And it justifies everything.
[3:38:54.460 --> 3:39:00.540]  And in fact, when we go and read the CIA and the military approach to mind control and
[3:39:00.540 --> 3:39:03.820]  in-culture, that was typically the kind of rationale, the kind of justification that they
[3:39:03.820 --> 3:39:04.820]  would have as well.
[3:39:04.820 --> 3:39:08.620]  We have to do it because if we don't, the Soviets are going to do it, you see.
[3:39:08.620 --> 3:39:10.860]  But so you see how this feeds into a...
[3:39:10.860 --> 3:39:13.260]  I mean, this could lead to the justification of anything, right?
[3:39:13.260 --> 3:39:16.180]  Oh, well, I mean, the enemy could be doing anything.
[3:39:16.180 --> 3:39:19.420]  So we have to be doing anything and everything.
[3:39:19.420 --> 3:39:24.260]  And if you study deep into the Cold War, you realize that although it was being fought
[3:39:24.260 --> 3:39:29.780]  on the ground level and amongst the spies and so forth in a real way, at the top, there
[3:39:29.780 --> 3:39:34.260]  was a lot of collusion going on that was an engineer dialectic.
[3:39:34.260 --> 3:39:35.820]  And many books have been written on this.
[3:39:35.820 --> 3:39:38.300]  This is kind of a known in academia.
[3:39:38.300 --> 3:39:42.860]  There's the famous book by Professor Antony Sutton, Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution
[3:39:42.860 --> 3:39:47.020]  where the Bolsheviks basically kicked off that whole revolution with support from a
[3:39:47.020 --> 3:39:53.660]  lot of Western industrialists and financial organizations.
[3:39:53.660 --> 3:39:58.460]  And other people pop up in the Cold War as kind of playing both sides and being involved
[3:39:58.460 --> 3:40:06.940]  in aiding this arena such as the United Nations, such as Bernard Baruch in terms of the nuclear
[3:40:06.940 --> 3:40:10.820]  program, which quickly goes into talking about.
[3:40:10.820 --> 3:40:15.260]  You have members of the Council on Foreign Relations being very pro-Soviet.
[3:40:15.260 --> 3:40:21.540]  They want to merge together with the Soviet Union and create a new global order out of
[3:40:21.540 --> 3:40:26.700]  the dialectical process of East versus West, capitalism versus Sovietism or communism.
[3:40:26.700 --> 3:40:33.700]  The product being the synthesis in the Hegelian philosophy, which underlies a lot of this.
[3:40:33.700 --> 3:40:37.860]  Other thinkers like David Rockefeller, as we know, as we covered last week, being very
[3:40:37.860 --> 3:40:43.540]  adamant about the positive aspects of socialism and communism and how this kind of a control
[3:40:43.540 --> 3:40:47.140]  mechanism might be something that we could look towards in the future.
[3:40:47.140 --> 3:40:51.220]  The Chinese socialist-communist model being something that could be a pattern for the
[3:40:51.220 --> 3:40:52.220]  rest of the world.
[3:40:52.220 --> 3:40:56.700]  David Rockefeller was famous for saying that as well as many other industrialists, many
[3:40:56.700 --> 3:41:05.540]  other very wealthy powerful individuals in the West supporting consistently socialist-communist
[3:41:05.540 --> 3:41:07.180]  Marxist causes.
[3:41:07.180 --> 3:41:13.420]  And this is why many grateful, even philosophers, even historians outside of the domain of geopolitics,
[3:41:13.420 --> 3:41:15.660]  nothing to do with conspiracy.
[3:41:15.660 --> 3:41:19.820]  What does the famous philosopher of history, Oswald Spengler, say?
[3:41:19.820 --> 3:41:26.580]  There's never been a socialist movement that didn't have the backing of capital or powerful
[3:41:26.580 --> 3:41:27.580]  capital.
[3:41:27.580 --> 3:41:33.060]  And so that's, I think, something we have to keep in mind as well as recent revelations
[3:41:33.060 --> 3:41:39.860]  about who the fifth man was in terms of the moles in Cambridge and Oxford and all this,
[3:41:39.860 --> 3:41:43.940]  all the spy stuff of Kim Filby and these kinds of things.
[3:41:43.940 --> 3:41:48.220]  And what we find out is that people like Victor Rothschild apparently were playing both sides
[3:41:48.220 --> 3:41:51.060]  in the Cold War, the famous spy.
[3:41:51.060 --> 3:41:54.340]  And there's many other cases of this, right?
[3:41:54.340 --> 3:41:58.220]  We have Anthony Sutton writing other books.
[3:41:58.220 --> 3:42:02.420]  Other writers have talked about how the Cold War could never have happened had there not
[3:42:02.420 --> 3:42:09.900]  been a lot of, you know, the Ford, for example, Ford helping to build plants, the Gorky Auto
[3:42:09.900 --> 3:42:10.900]  plant.
[3:42:10.900 --> 3:42:13.740]  I believe that was built by Ford for the Soviets.
[3:42:13.740 --> 3:42:18.140]  So none of this could have occurred without the militant industrial complex basically
[3:42:18.140 --> 3:42:23.300]  supporting the industrialists, supporting and building up the dialectical opposition to
[3:42:23.300 --> 3:42:24.300]  the American West.
[3:42:24.300 --> 3:42:28.660]  Now, if these figures were actually patriotic Americans who believed in Western ideas or
[3:42:28.660 --> 3:42:32.820]  Western ideals, why would they have expended so much time and energy?
[3:42:32.820 --> 3:42:38.460]  By the way, I think there's whole books written on how Walmart was helped by a certain Western
[3:42:38.460 --> 3:42:41.100]  very wealthy people set up in China.
[3:42:41.100 --> 3:42:45.540]  How could that have occurred if the people in the West, the rich people of the West were
[3:42:45.540 --> 3:42:50.060]  really good, you know, guys fighting for free markets and democracy?
[3:42:50.060 --> 3:42:52.660]  No, it's a game that's played out, you see.
[3:42:52.660 --> 3:42:55.140]  We're going to get back to Stranger Things in the next section.
[3:42:55.140 --> 3:42:56.140]  Don't go anywhere.

[3:43:19.180 --> 3:43:21.020]  Now there is not a wait.
[3:43:21.020 --> 3:43:25.340]  Almost every other storeable food distributor is completely out and will not have more food
[3:43:25.340 --> 3:43:30.220]  for months if ever and the prices are exploding.
[3:43:30.220 --> 3:43:34.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to protect yourself and your family and not be dependent
[3:43:34.460 --> 3:43:35.460]  on the system.
[3:43:35.460 --> 3:43:37.460]  The time to be self-sufficient is now.

[3:43:56.660 --> 3:44:03.580]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class, not
[3:44:03.580 --> 3:44:08.500]  in Communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[3:44:08.500 --> 3:44:12.820]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[3:44:12.820 --> 3:44:14.540]  That's done by design.
[3:44:14.540 --> 3:44:20.580]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[3:44:20.580 --> 3:44:25.460]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment, the sound of the Bilderberg Group, the Trilateral
[3:44:25.460 --> 3:44:30.580]  Commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[3:44:30.580 --> 3:44:34.820]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media of the Bilderberg Group didn't
[3:44:34.820 --> 3:44:35.820]  exist.
[3:44:35.820 --> 3:44:38.820]  Well, now the Bilderberg Group is public in its former head.
[3:44:38.820 --> 3:44:44.220]  Still on the steering committee is Klaus Schwab and he has set up the great reset in global
[3:44:44.220 --> 3:44:45.220]  government.
[3:44:45.220 --> 3:44:50.460]  And as a Liberty Movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about the second
[3:44:50.460 --> 3:44:52.900]  thing or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover.
[3:44:52.900 --> 3:44:53.900]  We don't have a shot.
[3:44:53.900 --> 3:44:54.900]  We do expose them.
[3:44:54.900 --> 3:44:55.900]  We can beat them easily.
[3:44:55.900 --> 3:45:00.740]  A lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find out of the thousands of great items

[3:45:17.900 --> 3:45:20.420]  is already unfolding with global food shortages.
[3:45:20.420 --> 3:45:24.700]  I told you over two years ago, the globalists are going to have massive inflation and food
[3:45:24.700 --> 3:45:27.860]  shortages and it's happened just like clockwork.
[3:45:27.860 --> 3:45:30.300]  And I'm telling you, it's going to get a lot worse.
[3:45:30.300 --> 3:45:31.620]  They have designed this.
[3:45:31.620 --> 3:45:37.060]  The way to beat them is to buy food now before your dollar is even more devalued.
[3:45:37.060 --> 3:45:42.820]  We're ready to ship to you right now at PrepareToday.com and not just storeable food, hundreds of

[3:45:54.540 --> 3:45:57.380]  Take action.
[3:45:57.380 --> 3:45:59.620]  Info Wars has made history.
[3:45:59.620 --> 3:46:03.700]  You have made history in your support of Info Wars and one of the biggest tools we've had
[3:46:03.700 --> 3:46:09.340]  to circumvent and override the sensors has been Patriot apparel so we can identify each
[3:46:09.340 --> 3:46:14.140]  other so we can spread the word and so we can push people to websites like InfoWars.com
[3:46:14.140 --> 3:46:17.100]  so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[3:46:17.100 --> 3:46:20.380]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our
[3:46:20.380 --> 3:46:24.100]  designs of t-shirts, some of which go back more than 25 years.
[3:46:24.100 --> 3:46:25.340]  All these shirts are limited edition.
[3:46:25.340 --> 3:46:30.260]  They are about to be history and will only exist in your closet, your drawer or your wardrobe.
[3:46:30.260 --> 3:46:34.860]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left in a couple weeks.
[3:46:34.860 --> 3:46:36.740]  They'll all be gone and they'll be history.
[3:46:36.740 --> 3:46:41.540]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[3:46:41.540 --> 3:46:43.380]  So thank you all for your support.

[3:46:48.740 --> 3:46:50.740]  ball caps, you name it, while you still can.
[3:46:50.740 --> 3:46:56.740]  I want to thank you all for your support, infowarstore.com.
[3:46:56.740 --> 3:47:08.740]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:08.740 --> 3:47:12.460]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:12.460 --> 3:47:14.020]  This is Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[3:47:14.020 --> 3:47:19.620]  We are doing a deep dive into the meaning and significance of Stranger Things and particularly
[3:47:19.620 --> 3:47:23.940]  the recent release of season four of Stranger Things, which actually isn't complete yet.
[3:47:23.940 --> 3:47:28.220]  There's a couple more episodes that they're waiting to release that will close out season
[3:47:28.220 --> 3:47:29.220]  four.
[3:47:29.220 --> 3:47:34.260]  But we were getting into the Cold War dialectic and now I want to go to the spiritual dimension
[3:47:34.260 --> 3:47:40.140]  because one thing that's going on in this show is consistent references to pop culture
[3:47:40.140 --> 3:47:45.740]  conspiracy theory and pop culture images of the battle between good and evil.
[3:47:45.740 --> 3:47:52.380]  So for example, the show mentions 80s horror films and the notion of the demonic and entities
[3:47:52.380 --> 3:47:57.620]  coming into this realm from the spiritual plane from the beyond.
[3:47:57.620 --> 3:48:03.100]  We have reference to Tolkien and to the Eye of Sauron and how that's really sort of the
[3:48:03.100 --> 3:48:07.780]  narrative that a lot of the characters in season four utilize consistently.
[3:48:07.780 --> 3:48:11.340]  They constantly reference the Shire, leaving the Shire going to Mordor.
[3:48:11.340 --> 3:48:17.700]  This is the domain where the demonic entities in the other dimension, the upside down, reside
[3:48:17.700 --> 3:48:22.420]  and that they're trying to kind of incarnate themselves into this world.
[3:48:22.420 --> 3:48:29.540]  And so the villain of the four season is a sort of mix of all the 80s horror villains,
[3:48:29.540 --> 3:48:34.220]  Freddie and you know, Penhead, right?
[3:48:34.220 --> 3:48:39.100]  We have such things to show you all these different 80s horror villains kind of enmeshed
[3:48:39.100 --> 3:48:45.580]  into one, which is this demonic entity who possesses different figures and kind of does
[3:48:45.580 --> 3:48:46.580]  ritual murders.
[3:48:46.580 --> 3:48:47.580]  Okay.
[3:48:47.580 --> 3:48:53.380]  So they add this occult ritual murder element to season four and there's a figure who is
[3:48:53.380 --> 3:48:59.300]  just sort of this 80s metalhead guy who they initially think is behind the murders.
[3:48:59.300 --> 3:49:02.820]  He's not the one that's really doing it.
[3:49:02.820 --> 3:49:07.260]  I thought it was fascinating that they brought in a serial killer ritual murder element to
[3:49:07.260 --> 3:49:11.620]  this season because again, that's something that's very important in the research of the
[3:49:11.620 --> 3:49:16.560]  serial killers because there does seem to be a connection between the mind control experiment
[3:49:16.560 --> 3:49:21.740]  and if some of these experiments went wrong, that some of these serial killers had been
[3:49:21.740 --> 3:49:23.540]  a part of that.
[3:49:23.540 --> 3:49:25.460]  That's brought out in this season.
[3:49:25.460 --> 3:49:30.140]  It's hinted at and we find out that number one who's sort of the main villain, he's kind
[3:49:30.140 --> 3:49:35.020]  of possessed by this, this Invecna entity, this demon from the beyond and this demon
[3:49:35.020 --> 3:49:40.340]  drives him to do these kind of ritual murders and to, to display the bodies and these sort
[3:49:40.340 --> 3:49:41.340]  of bent poses.
[3:49:41.340 --> 3:49:45.980]  So you get these references to kind of Dahmer stuff, the way Dahmer would, would kill another
[3:49:45.980 --> 3:49:51.540]  serial killers from the 80s and 90s and 70s, 80s and 90s.
[3:49:51.540 --> 3:49:57.820]  And we find out that what's really going on is that the military things, this is interesting,
[3:49:57.820 --> 3:50:03.580]  that the ritual murders are being done by Soviet sleeper agents.
[3:50:03.580 --> 3:50:07.100]  So the military is trapped in this kind of dialectical thinking that well, it has to
[3:50:07.100 --> 3:50:13.540]  be, you know, Soviet people coming after us and they don't really grasp that there's
[3:50:13.540 --> 3:50:18.860]  a secret project going on in the Department of Energy that's above the military that's
[3:50:18.860 --> 3:50:24.620]  really behind this, that is engaging in just really sort of unbelievable experiments on
[3:50:24.620 --> 3:50:27.340]  the youth, abusive youth and so forth.
[3:50:27.340 --> 3:50:33.780]  And that they have produced both 11 who is the sort of hero protagonist girl and her
[3:50:33.780 --> 3:50:39.860]  nemesis number one who is the demonically possessed kind of, so in other words, his
[3:50:39.860 --> 3:50:44.700]  programming went haywire and so he becomes this ritual murderer figure.
[3:50:44.700 --> 3:50:50.700]  He's really behind the murders and the show continually references where he is and where
[3:50:50.700 --> 3:50:56.420]  his domain is in both the spiritual sense and at the secret underground base.
[3:50:56.420 --> 3:50:58.420]  It's referenced as Mordor.
[3:50:58.420 --> 3:51:05.900]  I thought that was fascinating that you have all these Tolkien-esque references.
[3:51:05.900 --> 3:51:10.020]  There's references to things that are emerging right in the middle of the 80s, the internet
[3:51:10.020 --> 3:51:11.860]  becomes a big deal.
[3:51:11.860 --> 3:51:17.620]  The references are made to the beast and that it is really the beast that is behind this
[3:51:17.620 --> 3:51:20.780]  dialectical battle of East versus West.
[3:51:20.780 --> 3:51:26.860]  We know that the cop character Hop, who's sort of the surrogate father to 11, he's been
[3:51:26.860 --> 3:51:33.020]  imprisoned in a Soviet gulag, so a large portion of the series is him escaping the Soviet gulags.
[3:51:33.020 --> 3:51:39.140]  But really the main point here is that the actual battle that's going on is a spiritual
[3:51:39.140 --> 3:51:47.180]  battle and the children, this sort of this Goonies group here, they have tapped into
[3:51:47.180 --> 3:51:51.380]  what's really going on through the pop culture fiction that they're into.
[3:51:51.380 --> 3:51:57.660]  So, for example, there's multiple references to John Carpenter movies throughout the 80s.
[3:51:57.660 --> 3:52:02.380]  A lot of the characters have John Carpenter posters like The Thing hanging up and they're
[3:52:02.380 --> 3:52:08.100]  big fans of John Carpenter's movies, and so in season four we have a lot of references
[3:52:08.100 --> 3:52:13.620]  to the apocalypse, to the end, to this opening of the abyss, again, which is mentioned in
[3:52:13.620 --> 3:52:17.860]  the apocalypse of scripture, and the opening of the abyss, the sort of hell mouth, this
[3:52:17.860 --> 3:52:25.860]  portal is what's going to allow this evil to be unleashed into our world, into our dimension.
[3:52:25.860 --> 3:52:32.980]  Very Sauron, very Mordor-ish here, because Sauron wants to incarnate.
[3:52:32.980 --> 3:52:39.300]  But the reason I find this fascinating is just that the children are more hip to what's
[3:52:39.300 --> 3:52:45.060]  going on by paying attention to the archetypes and the symbols in pop culture.
[3:52:45.060 --> 3:52:48.660]  And so if you don't know, John Carpenter, of course, has a famous trilogy known as the
[3:52:48.660 --> 3:52:53.500]  apocalypse trilogy, and they're not directly connected, they're just three movies that
[3:52:53.500 --> 3:52:58.380]  he made, which are very apocalyptic in scope and in significance.
[3:52:58.380 --> 3:53:02.060]  So there's The Thing, there's Prince of Darkness, and there's In the Mouth of Madness, and
[3:53:02.060 --> 3:53:06.900]  they're worth mentioning because, again, I think they're kind of in the subtext of this
[3:53:06.900 --> 3:53:13.420]  season as well as other things like Tolkien, Hellraiser, and Freddy, and so forth.
[3:53:13.420 --> 3:53:18.620]  And in the John Carpenter trilogy you have a, in The Thing, of course we have this off-world
[3:53:18.620 --> 3:53:26.300]  entity which is exiled from the heavens, from space, and crashes on our planet and becomes
[3:53:26.300 --> 3:53:31.540]  this entity that can kind of take over in a borg invasion of the body snatchers way.
[3:53:31.540 --> 3:53:35.820]  The Thing, it perfectly mimics everything that we have.
[3:53:35.820 --> 3:53:42.140]  And if you go into depth analyzing The Thing, the original Thing came out during the outside
[3:53:42.140 --> 3:53:43.900]  of the Cold War as well.
[3:53:43.900 --> 3:53:48.740]  John Carpenter's The Thing also has a kind of a Cold War theme to it because one of the
[3:53:48.740 --> 3:53:54.900]  characters is thought to be a Soviet, right, and there's a Soviet western thing going on
[3:53:54.900 --> 3:53:58.380]  throughout chess game that's going on with the Kurt Russell and so forth throughout the
[3:53:58.380 --> 3:54:00.380]  whole narrative.
[3:54:00.380 --> 3:54:06.180]  In the next trilogy, Prince of Darkness, we have explicit references to a cult within
[3:54:06.180 --> 3:54:12.460]  the superstructure of the Roman Catholic Church, which is kind of an inner Gnostic cult that
[3:54:12.460 --> 3:54:16.620]  is, if I recall, headed by Donald Pleasance.
[3:54:16.620 --> 3:54:21.500]  So Donald Pleasance often plays kind of a secret Gnostic Luciferian priest.
[3:54:21.500 --> 3:54:26.700]  If you've ever seen the old pre-Eyes, Watch, Shut movie, Eye of the Devil, Donald Pleasance
[3:54:26.700 --> 3:54:29.060]  plays a Luciferian priest in that as well.
[3:54:29.060 --> 3:54:39.100]  And Donald Pleasance is always playing the Luciferian priest who demands the human sacrifice.
[3:54:39.100 --> 3:54:41.020]  Well in Prince of Darkness it's no different.
[3:54:41.020 --> 3:54:44.700]  I don't think he's a bad guy, but he's just kind of this Gnostic priest that knows what
[3:54:44.700 --> 3:54:46.820]  the Roman Catholic Church is really about.
[3:54:46.820 --> 3:54:51.020]  And it ties into quantum mechanics and the idea that a portal is going to be opened and
[3:54:51.020 --> 3:54:56.620]  that the Antichrist from the future is somehow beaming his transmission back in time through
[3:54:56.620 --> 3:55:00.140]  quantum mechanics to the present day.
[3:55:00.140 --> 3:55:04.060]  And the show, if you've never seen Prince of Darkness, it's a great 80s B-Hormone, but
[3:55:04.060 --> 3:55:10.660]  it ends with the entities from the beyond stepping into our domain, very Lovecraft kind
[3:55:10.660 --> 3:55:11.660]  of thing, right?
[3:55:11.660 --> 3:55:17.660]  The Cthulhu and these old entities from the beyond stepping into the here and the now.
[3:55:17.660 --> 3:55:19.780]  In the mouth of madness, exact same thing, right?
[3:55:19.780 --> 3:55:27.220]  You have this Stephen King kind of character, Sam Neal is the main guy and that.
[3:55:27.220 --> 3:55:32.660]  And he's a writer who has dissociative identity disorder and finds out that he's kind of possessed
[3:55:32.660 --> 3:55:38.820]  by this entity from another domain or another dimension and it's very into the world, very
[3:55:38.820 --> 3:55:39.820]  apocalyptic.
[3:55:39.820 --> 3:55:44.540]  He becomes a sort of channel for Antichrist or the spirit of the Antichrist and he pens
[3:55:44.540 --> 3:55:50.620]  this novel, which he, unbeknownst to him, kind of instantiates the end of the world.
[3:55:50.620 --> 3:55:57.060]  All of that, again, is referenced and is a subtext in Stranger Things season four.
[3:55:57.060 --> 3:56:01.220]  And I say all that to, again, not to say that I think we're necessarily at the end of the
[3:56:01.220 --> 3:56:09.220]  world or the end of time, but there's always an apocalyptic element to the idea of the Cold
[3:56:09.220 --> 3:56:15.180]  War and the Soviets and the US, Russia and the West, you know, nuking each other.
[3:56:15.180 --> 3:56:20.420]  But what we find in a lot of the fiction that I think is worth looking at and tapping into
[3:56:20.420 --> 3:56:27.620]  is the idea that this battle, this dialectic is being managed at a higher level by a higher
[3:56:27.620 --> 3:56:30.860]  power and this is in a lot of the fiction.
[3:56:30.860 --> 3:56:36.100]  If you've never seen the movie 2010, which is the sequel to, you know, the Kubrick Arthur
[3:56:36.100 --> 3:56:43.220]  C. Clarke 2001, Arthur C. Clarke was in the circles of the Luciferian elite.
[3:56:43.220 --> 3:56:48.500]  So he was writing into those novels what the real plans were, what they really believed.
[3:56:48.500 --> 3:56:53.860]  And if you go and watch 2010, you'll find out that the Soviet Western dialectic, the
[3:56:53.860 --> 3:56:56.860]  whole point of that was to produce this new Aeon.
[3:56:56.860 --> 3:57:02.100]  And in 2010, it's an Aeon that they explicitly call the Children of Light.
[3:57:02.100 --> 3:57:07.060]  It will be the period in which we enter into colonizing space and it will result out of
[3:57:07.060 --> 3:57:15.180]  the clash, the dialectic, right, the nuclear war in 2001 that Star Child ignites, right?
[3:57:15.180 --> 3:57:20.380]  This leads to the new era of after a mass depopulation, we'll enter into this new era,
[3:57:20.380 --> 3:57:21.380]  right?
[3:57:21.380 --> 3:57:27.420]  If you watch the Watchmen, right, Alan Moore, the famous esoteric graphic novel writer,
[3:57:27.420 --> 3:57:31.580]  that was a situation that was engineered to massively depopulate the planet out of the
[3:57:31.580 --> 3:57:32.580]  Cold War.
[3:57:32.580 --> 3:57:37.820]  And then we enter into a new Aeon apiece and in Stranger Things season four, the villain,
[3:57:37.820 --> 3:57:38.820]  the bad guy.
[3:57:38.820 --> 3:57:41.140]  What does he say at the end of season four?
[3:57:41.140 --> 3:57:46.140]  He says that my goal is to reduce the population of the planet severely.
[3:57:46.140 --> 3:57:49.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the truth.
[3:57:49.140 --> 3:57:50.660]  We have the smoking gun evidence.
[3:57:50.660 --> 3:57:56.580]  We know what happened during the 2020 election, how the deep state controlled Democrats stole
[3:57:56.580 --> 3:57:57.580]  the election.
[3:57:57.580 --> 3:58:02.460]  They stole the proof, absolutely cut and dry, there's no denying it.
[3:58:02.460 --> 3:58:08.220]  It's the film 2000 Mules by Dinesh to Susan, and we have the DVD with the expanded extras

[3:58:22.620 --> 3:58:27.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the film every American must have.
[3:58:27.780 --> 3:58:32.180]  This is the most important documentary ever made in U.S. history because it proves that
[3:58:32.180 --> 3:58:36.580]  a major presidential election was stolen and it shows how they did it and how they're
[3:58:36.580 --> 3:58:37.940]  planning to do it again.

[3:58:53.100 --> 3:58:56.100]  banned.video.
[3:58:56.100 --> 3:59:02.220]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry, you guys have no idea how many people
[3:59:02.220 --> 3:59:07.300]  have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez, how many people have just been put on a launch
[3:59:07.300 --> 3:59:11.180]  pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[3:59:11.180 --> 3:59:15.740]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform and
[3:59:15.740 --> 3:59:19.780]  I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[3:59:19.780 --> 3:59:24.580]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cas, the super
[3:59:24.580 --> 3:59:25.580]  Tim Cas IRL.
[3:59:25.580 --> 3:59:31.460]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and banned.video for granted because
[3:59:31.460 --> 3:59:33.780]  you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[3:59:33.780 --> 3:59:36.580]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[3:59:36.580 --> 3:59:41.380]  So go check out the store, go support their store, go support info wars, leave a donation
[3:59:41.380 --> 3:59:42.380]  right now.
