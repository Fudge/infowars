[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:01.752]  Emergency Friday broadcast.
[00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:08.242]  Globulus-controlled hospitals are medically kidnapping patients and killing them all over the Western world.
[00:00:08.262 --> 00:00:11.787]  And that's just the first headline.
[00:00:12.568 --> 00:00:14.231]  Meanwhile, as predicted...
[00:00:15.234 --> 00:00:25.823]  New lab-grown version of HIV spiked with COVID-19 has been released in the Netherlands as part of phase two of the globalist depopulation operations.
[00:00:26.863 --> 00:00:36.211]  Dr. Peter McCullough will join Alex live to counter MSM lies that he put out disinformation on Joe Rogan.
[00:00:37.017 --> 00:00:39.240]  You do not want to miss that second hour.
[00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.620]   From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:01:03.620]  [Music]
[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.620]  InfoWars.
[00:01:04.828 --> 00:01:06.828]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:01:06.828 --> 00:01:16.828]  It's Friday, February 4th, 2022.
[00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:28.597]  And each day, each broadcast gets more intense because of the terrain we are in spiritually, physically, mentally, financially, interdimensionally.
[00:01:31.793 --> 00:01:35.535]  Again, all of these articles and documents are not here as props.
[00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:45.439]  I have probably read 20% of these articles this morning and scanned over the rest, and I just must cover it all.
[00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:48.861]  I've got to at least hit on the surface of these.
[00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:51.722]  This is unbelievable.
[00:01:53.062 --> 00:01:55.063]  But I am in a paradox, a catch-22.
[00:01:56.144 --> 00:02:02.386]   I should really only talk about one Story today that is the biggest.
[00:02:04.127 --> 00:02:05.468]  And then it ties into all the others.
[00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.071]  In fact, I just wrote the show headline minutes before we went live.
[00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:11.311]  It's about to go up.
[00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:12.252]  I dictated it.
[00:02:13.553 --> 00:02:21.117]  And I decided to go with the medical kidnapping all over the world by big pharma control hospitals, where they're keeping people away from children and adults to then murder them.
[00:02:22.538 --> 00:02:26.280]  And say COVID-19 did it after stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from each victim.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.301]  That's all confirmed.
[00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:35.339]  In criminal cases, lawsuits, lawyers, Epic Times has a huge breakdown on that.
[00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:36.260]  That's giant.
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.541]  But it's not the root.
[00:02:41.383 --> 00:02:43.685]  The headline deals with that, and we're going to leave the headline that way.
[00:02:43.725 --> 00:02:44.285]  That's important.
[00:02:45.946 --> 00:02:50.189]  The sub-headline deals with the root.
[00:02:53.392 --> 00:02:56.774]  And I knew this was coming, and we were the first to say it, along with Dr. Boyle.
[00:02:57.597 --> 00:03:18.833]  Because when you've got all the jigsaw pieces in front of you, and you start putting them in, and you know that the same jigsaw maker took the photo and made this one as similar ones you built before, even though you've not seen the cover of the box even, you start figuring out what the image is.
[00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:30.926]   And so two years ago, now two years ago, Two years ago, plus now, I have the articles right here from InfoWars.com, late January 2020.
[00:03:31.906 --> 00:03:42.291]  Now, two plus years, we specifically, exactly predicted what they would do.
[00:03:43.492 --> 00:03:49.774]  And when I got up this morning at 5am and started researching and saw these headlines, it was like a punch in the stomach.
[00:03:54.016 --> 00:04:03.095]   How are you going to like A common cold virus that you can't escape, that gives you HIV, gives you AIDS.
[00:04:04.876 --> 00:04:05.577]  How you gonna like that?
[00:04:05.597 --> 00:04:11.461]  Because that's really what COVID-19 is.
[00:04:13.343 --> 00:04:18.167]  And then when you take the vaccine, it actually starts growing it inside your body.
[00:04:18.207 --> 00:04:20.869]  And you'd ask, well, why don't they just give you one shot that gives it to you right away?
[00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:29.434]  Well, then it's too obvious, but if they do it through a group of shots, then it slowly happens, and the demographics are different, so they're able to hide it better.
[00:04:30.554 --> 00:04:33.116]  They also hit certain populations with placebos, now confirmed.
[00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:36.978]  And then they can also have cures.
[00:04:37.038 --> 00:04:41.480]  They've got treatments and cures for themselves when they get infected to the prion crystals.
[00:04:43.564 --> 00:04:55.330]  And things that mitigate it, even when you're not actively sick, things like ivermectin do go in and start eradicating the lattice that these prion crystal occupiers, colonizers build.
[00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.552]  So we've cracked the complete code, and they've now announced it.
[00:05:00.232 --> 00:05:07.596]  They've now announced, oh my gosh, there's a new deadly HIV, why you catch it like a cold, and it's more deadly and it's gonna kill you.
[00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.351]  Oh, it mutated with COVID-19, that's right.
[00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:14.032]  Viruses don't do that, folks.
[00:05:15.132 --> 00:05:21.815]  And the Indian scientists, when they first looked at it in January two years ago, they've got a gene editing machine.
[00:05:21.975 --> 00:05:23.696]  They said, this is man-made.
[00:05:23.736 --> 00:05:25.877]  This is five different viruses, very serious.
[00:05:26.398 --> 00:05:28.138]  HIV delivery system, spike protein.
[00:05:28.359 --> 00:05:29.999]  They gave the code number, owned by Fauci.
[00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:31.120]  He owns it with Bill Gates.
[00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.483]  I mean, Bill Gates even owns the weapon in our bodies.
[00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:35.823]  It's in my body, it's in your body.
[00:05:36.143 --> 00:05:38.944]  And they're just murdering us with extreme enjoyment.
[00:05:39.745 --> 00:05:41.025]  And we're probably just going to lay down and take it.
[00:05:41.085 --> 00:05:41.625]  That's what we do.
[00:05:42.145 --> 00:05:42.726]  And our children.
[00:05:43.366 --> 00:05:44.066]  He's our God.
[00:05:44.286 --> 00:05:45.267]  Our children belong to Bill Gates.
[00:05:45.587 --> 00:05:46.427]  He is our king.
[00:05:47.627 --> 00:05:48.348]  You got me.
[00:05:50.848 --> 00:05:53.209]  Welcome so much for joining us.
[00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:59.652]  I want to thank you so much for being here with us on this Friday, February 4th, 2022 transmission.
[00:06:02.825 --> 00:06:09.589]  I know a lot of haters tune in as well, but everybody to know who's signed on to this evil system, you're not going to get out of the system.
[00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.491]  You're not going to come out on top serving it.
[00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:19.196]  The only way we make it out of this is coming back to goodness, coming back to God and coming back to being honest, decent people.
[00:06:20.837 --> 00:06:27.201]  And so we got a big tent here for everybody who wants to be informed and involved and engaged.
[00:06:31.305 --> 00:06:33.526]  Because I'm not out to destroy or hurt anybody.
[00:06:34.466 --> 00:06:37.067]  But I do have a mission and a job to not go along with this evil.
[00:06:37.547 --> 00:06:43.829]  And I have reverse engineered along with all of our experts, guests and researchers what's exactly going on.
[00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:46.410]  And it is incredible.
[00:06:50.031 --> 00:06:54.553]  Now, there's a lot that goes into this, and I'm going to cover it in great detail at the bottom of the hour.
[00:06:55.307 --> 00:07:11.759]  And I hope that everybody out there reaches out to their friends, their family, their neighbors, random strangers, and tells them to tune in right now at InfoWars.com forward slash show, FreeWorldNews.tv, and the current URL, they're not banning or blocking, FutureNews.news.
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.884]  And send them the live feed that's live on the Alex Jones section there at FutureNews.news.
[00:07:21.505 --> 00:07:38.260]  I didn't just get up here last month or last year or today and say they're going to roll out a new HIV that's basically airborne and that is much more deadly and that attacks your white blood cells.
[00:07:40.182 --> 00:07:48.449]  And that what they launched, what Fauci was program leader on, what they launched in the late 1970s, early 1980s, he was high level on the project, became the director later.
[00:07:49.941 --> 00:07:54.884]  was a beta test for the new group and batch of these viruses that they're releasing.
[00:07:57.606 --> 00:08:01.348]  And these viruses, of course, mutate over time and become less infectious.
[00:08:01.388 --> 00:08:16.697]  They're developed to be very deadly in the lab, but over time, even artificial viruses under God's system and plan degenerate and procreate into a system that is not as deadly.
[00:08:18.177 --> 00:08:24.342]  And that actually is able to live in the host organism, which is the real mission of the virus, not to actually kill its host.
[00:08:27.144 --> 00:08:32.708]  So we knew this in January and February, two years ago.
[00:08:33.068 --> 00:08:43.336]  And I have all the articles, you know, unlike Brian Stelter, unlike mainstream media, I will actually show you the articles when we wrote them, what we said, and then give you the new news.
[00:08:45.637 --> 00:08:46.438]  And it's very horrible.
[00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:51.543]  New HIV strain found in the Netherlands.
[00:08:52.044 --> 00:08:53.004]  Highly infectious.
[00:08:53.104 --> 00:08:57.086]  Variant makes people ill twice as quickly.
[00:08:59.087 --> 00:09:02.389]  Now, I don't just go off this as if it's true or you're believing it out of the Daily Mail.
[00:09:02.809 --> 00:09:04.050]  I already know about this project.
[00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.431]  I already knew this was coming.
[00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:35.026]   I told you, and we can get the archivist to find it, in January and February, two years ago, and March, laying out our predictions that the vaccine for COVID-19 would cause autoimmune deficiency disorder, autoimmune deficiency syndrome, and that they would then just say, oh really, suddenly everybody's just got HIV.
[00:09:35.406 --> 00:09:47.809]  Because I read the scientific reports, I read the scans of the man-made virus, COVID-19, and we know Fauci headed up the HIV bioweapon program against Africa, that blew back into the West by design.
[00:09:49.759 --> 00:10:01.802]  And into gay men with compromised immune systems from hundreds of partners and methamphetamine use that could also tip the T lymphocytes over to dying and being susceptible to colonization by the HIV.
[00:10:02.242 --> 00:10:05.303]  There's a lot of other factors that went into it, but that's the real science on it.
[00:10:07.363 --> 00:10:09.124]  So you study criminology.
[00:10:09.204 --> 00:10:11.845]  Criminals like to do the same thing over and over again.
[00:10:12.785 --> 00:10:17.126]  And Fauci was heavily involved in developing and deploying HIV against the world.
[00:10:18.168 --> 00:10:25.450]  I mean, he was known back then, it came out, and blocking good treatments and giving people deadly treatments that also then kill the sick.
[00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.030]  That's his added fun.
[00:10:27.351 --> 00:10:32.612]  Just like Rendezivir, but 37% of people, it kills them on record.
[00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:39.794]  So they don't let you have zinc or hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin or vitamin D. You don't get any of that.
[00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:42.911]  It's like, oh, you're drowning?
[00:10:42.931 --> 00:10:44.072]  Let me hold your head underwater.
[00:10:44.492 --> 00:10:50.236]  How about some randesivir that does nothing to stop the virus and literally eats your liver and kidneys?
[00:10:51.397 --> 00:10:52.638]  Hey, renal failure is fun, huh?
[00:10:52.658 --> 00:10:57.281]  A little gift from old Doc E. F. D. R. Fauci.
[00:11:01.124 --> 00:11:13.877]   And so we looked at COVID-19 and the man-made spike protein synthetic HIV delivery system, and we said it's going to give people False positives for HIV.
[00:11:14.037 --> 00:11:17.902]  And indeed, they go, Oh, some of the COVID vaccines cause false positives.
[00:11:17.922 --> 00:11:20.706]  Don't worry, wink wink, you don't really have HIV.
[00:11:22.228 --> 00:11:23.830]  And they just sit there and watch what it does.
[00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:55.002]   And then when you take the Pfizer, the Moderna or the J&J or AstraZeneca, they all have different mechanisms, but they're The same destination as Fauci told him in December before COVID was even announced two plus years ago, 25 months ago, 26 months ago, came out in documents via Peter Daszak's group and lawsuits that, oh, oh, get ready for this type of vaccine and your vaccine can do it however it wants, but it's got to create this spike protein in the body.
[00:11:56.576 --> 00:12:03.458]  Which is the alone, man-manipulated, man-made HIV delivery system.
[00:12:03.838 --> 00:12:04.238]  On record!
[00:12:04.258 --> 00:12:05.058]  This is not debatable.
[00:12:05.378 --> 00:12:05.838]  It's a fact.
[00:12:09.119 --> 00:12:12.480]  Like, what the molecular makeup of is water is a fact.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.161]  Well, this is a fact.
[00:12:14.461 --> 00:12:18.402]  And then you look at it and you go, well, they're going to give you something that makes you sick and turns off your white blood cells.
[00:12:18.862 --> 00:12:21.823]  They're going to put a virus out that attacks your white blood cells.
[00:12:22.263 --> 00:12:26.609]   And then they're going to Sit back and try to cover this up.
[00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:28.751]  How are they going to do it?
[00:12:28.811 --> 00:12:35.335]  I've said last year and this year, thousands of times, they're going to have a new virus that shows up on the scene even worse.
[00:12:35.475 --> 00:12:36.155]  And guess what?
[00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:40.698]  It's the super HIV that's much easier to catch.
[00:12:42.546 --> 00:12:44.969]  And kills you a lot faster, they're saying.
[00:12:45.349 --> 00:13:04.768]  And then when you find out you're positive, when you're really just positive from the so-called vaccine, you will then go and Fauci, who owns the big patents on the stuff, will pump you full of the AZT and all the new chemicals and interferon disruptors and the rest of it, that will kill your ass.
[00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:06.390]  Just like Rendezvous.
[00:13:07.125 --> 00:13:11.826]  And so they will get you sick with the first phase, the bioweapon, and then it's binary.
[00:13:12.086 --> 00:13:14.947]  They will then hit you with the next phase of the bioweapon.
[00:13:17.008 --> 00:13:17.808]  And that's how it works.
[00:13:18.268 --> 00:13:18.828]  Just like that.
[00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:23.570]  And then they get all the money out of you while they kill you.
[00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.270]  See how that works.
[00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:27.231]  Learn about binary weapons.
[00:13:28.371 --> 00:13:29.331]  So that's at the bottom of the hour.
[00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:30.612]  I'm going to go through all that.
[00:13:30.652 --> 00:13:31.652]  It's a big deal.
[00:13:32.313 --> 00:13:35.474]  And we predicted it would show up, and they would do it exactly, and they have.
[00:13:35.754 --> 00:13:36.534]  Because we know the enemy.
[00:13:36.914 --> 00:13:37.434]  That's what we do.
[00:13:38.295 --> 00:13:40.435]  And that's why they want us off air, that's why they can't stand us.
[00:13:40.475 --> 00:13:44.336]  Now that leads me... That's one stack.
[00:13:46.136 --> 00:13:47.117]  One incredible stack.
[00:13:47.657 --> 00:13:49.457]  Let me tell you about the other incredible stacks.
[00:13:50.177 --> 00:14:04.053]   Amazing stuff happening in Canada and around the world with these truckers, triggering peaceful revolution everywhere, and letting all the weak-minded that have stayed quiet and felt alone, and been gaslit under Mass Stockholm psychosis is what I call it.
[00:14:04.413 --> 00:14:05.974]  Call it mass formation psychosis.
[00:14:06.274 --> 00:14:09.356]  Carl Jung and the clinical term would be mass psychosis.
[00:14:09.816 --> 00:14:11.697]  Mob rule, the madness of crowds.
[00:14:12.238 --> 00:14:14.399]  Those are the more arcane names for it.
[00:14:15.159 --> 00:14:16.320]  The founding fathers talked about.
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.021]  But here we are.
[00:14:20.222 --> 00:14:26.046]  And they're now announcing the Canadian news that the government's preparing to use the military against them.
[00:14:26.787 --> 00:14:28.528]  Boy, I sure hope they do that.
[00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:30.589]  That would really backfire on the New World Order.
[00:14:30.729 --> 00:14:34.211]  Except, if they do use the military, they will stage a false flag.
[00:14:35.812 --> 00:14:44.677]  All special operations at the captain level and above get taught how to stage false flags when you're outnumbered and can't defeat a group.
[00:14:45.357 --> 00:14:47.999]  And if they're given orders, they will stage a false flag.
[00:14:48.019 --> 00:14:48.699]  The military will.
[00:14:49.239 --> 00:14:51.741]  The public just has to be made aware of that.
[00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:52.201]  Okay?
[00:14:53.038 --> 00:15:05.833]  But it came out in the WikiLeaks, and I already knew this because I talked to family that was told this stuff when they were in the military, that it was captains and above in the Green Berets being taught how to stage a false flag.
[00:15:06.556 --> 00:15:09.179]  And that might mean killing a village kid and blaming it on the enemy.
[00:15:09.579 --> 00:15:14.725]  Or that might mean blowing up, you know, the food supply at the village and the water supply, the water tower to blame the enemy.
[00:15:14.985 --> 00:15:18.028]  If you gotta get people pissed and forced to multiply them, it's what you do.
[00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:20.852]  So the next big move will be a false flag against the truckers.
[00:15:21.091 --> 00:15:23.091]  We got all that stuff for you coming up as well.
[00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:47.091]  [Music]
[00:15:47.091 --> 00:15:50.091]  Emergency Friday Broadcast.
[00:15:50.036 --> 00:15:55.801]  Globalist-controlled hospitals are medically kidnapping patients and killing them all over the Western world.
[00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:59.325]  And that's just the first headline.
[00:16:00.105 --> 00:16:13.357]  Meanwhile, as predicted, new lab-grown version of HIV spiked with COVID-19 has been released in the Netherlands as part of phase two of the globalist depopulation operations.
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:23.786]  Dr. Peter McCullough will join Alex live to counter MSM lies that he put out disinformation on Joe Rogan.
[00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:26.768]  You do not want to miss that second hour.
[00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:28.429]  All right.
[00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.232]  Bottom of the hour, I'm going to hit the big HIV news.
[00:16:33.553 --> 00:16:37.115]  And people know I don't just put out fear porn.
[00:16:38.776 --> 00:16:41.398]  People used to tune in 20 years ago, they thought this is wildly entertaining.
[00:16:42.262 --> 00:16:44.503]  Even Harry Shearer, you know, went on national TV.
[00:16:45.163 --> 00:16:46.504]  He's a great actor, great comedian.
[00:16:46.564 --> 00:16:47.524]  You love the work he does.
[00:16:48.244 --> 00:16:49.965]  And Spinal Tap, The Simpsons, you name it.
[00:16:50.525 --> 00:16:52.346]  And said, man, Alex Jones is just incredible.
[00:16:52.366 --> 00:16:53.646]  He's one of the greatest writers ever.
[00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:56.967]  The stuff he comes up with, he's just a science-fixing genius.
[00:16:57.588 --> 00:16:59.769]  No, dude, I didn't come up with any of this.
[00:17:01.049 --> 00:17:02.149]  It's what they're doing to us.
[00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:05.911]  And I get that it sounds insane.
[00:17:07.031 --> 00:17:07.451]  Believe me.
[00:17:08.332 --> 00:17:08.972]  But they're doing it.
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.527]  And I've had a lot of friends and family get really sick or die from this crap.
[00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.638]  And the damn vaccine is not a vaccine and it attacks your white blood cells.
[00:17:19.999 --> 00:17:20.399]  On record!
[00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.051]  It's all confirmed now!
[00:17:23.612 --> 00:17:43.311]  And they've made their move, that's why they've paid out tens of billions of dollars from high-level influencers, movie stars, basketball players, football players, who get hundreds of thousands if not millions, right down to small YouTube channels with 100,000 members, with maybe 10-20,000 people watching their videos at a time, getting tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:17:44.632 --> 00:17:46.214]  Thousands of people have gone public!
[00:17:47.358 --> 00:17:59.266]  TikTok influencers, you name it, and said, look, here's the letter offering me $2,000 up to $50,000, $100,000, depending on the letters, for every time I mention and say I took the vaccine, I love it.
[00:18:01.868 --> 00:18:02.588]  I took the vaccine.
[00:18:02.808 --> 00:18:03.149]  I took it.
[00:18:03.329 --> 00:18:03.669]  It works.
[00:18:03.869 --> 00:18:04.249]  I loved it.
[00:18:04.409 --> 00:18:04.870]  It's wonderful.
[00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:06.251]  Oh my gosh, I want boosters.
[00:18:06.431 --> 00:18:06.911]  It's so great.
[00:18:07.231 --> 00:18:08.232]  Bing, bing, bing, cashier.
[00:18:08.272 --> 00:18:09.473]  Ching, ching, ching, ching, ching, ching, ching.
[00:18:10.683 --> 00:18:14.064]  They did all this, folks, to move against the public.
[00:18:14.084 --> 00:18:17.204]  And you can say, well, the dumbasses that believe it and take it, they deserve it.
[00:18:18.784 --> 00:18:33.687]  Do the children... Do the children deserve to be injected with something that the Pfizer, Moderna, J&J, and AstraZeneca all turn off the killer T?
[00:18:35.047 --> 00:18:38.668]  The killer T is the infantryman of the blood.
[00:18:40.033 --> 00:18:56.159]  HIV attacks the T lymphocyte, that is the general, that first approaches, sees what something is, and then goes and puts out, call it viruses, orders, whatever, chemical orders, to the other white blood cells to attack.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.800]  So HIV takes out the generals.
[00:19:02.461 --> 00:19:07.163]  COVID injections, masquerading as vaccines, take out the troops.
[00:19:08.914 --> 00:19:11.355]  Jack Spratt could eat no fat, his wife could eat no lean.
[00:19:11.775 --> 00:19:15.036]  Between the two of them, they licked the platter clean.
[00:19:18.277 --> 00:19:20.498]  Yeah, what do you think killer Ts do all day?
[00:19:20.518 --> 00:19:23.880]  They just run around like Pac-Man, eating cancer viruses.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.140]  Eating cancer cells.
[00:19:28.121 --> 00:19:31.982]  This is a direct attack on your defense system.
[00:19:34.123 --> 00:19:35.824]  They're basically amoebas.
[00:19:36.812 --> 00:19:43.635]  Programmed and grown in your bones, in your femurs, to kill the enemies of your body.
[00:19:45.075 --> 00:19:50.378]  And if you want to take your body down, you shut those little sweethearts down.
[00:19:51.278 --> 00:19:52.038]  Plus, they deserve to die.
[00:19:52.058 --> 00:19:52.439]  They're white.
[00:19:52.779 --> 00:19:53.539]  They are white in color.
[00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:53.879]  Very bad.
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.541]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is where we are.
[00:20:00.782 --> 00:20:01.662]  And this is what we face.
[00:20:01.682 --> 00:20:05.244]  And I'm going to hit all the science next segment, but here's an example of what we're talking about.
[00:20:06.744 --> 00:20:12.587]  They had a State Department briefing yesterday, and an AP reporter is saying, we want to see proof.
[00:20:12.627 --> 00:20:15.989]  You know, like, Kennedy showed the nuclear missile launchers in Cuba.
[00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:24.474]  And at least with the fake WMDs in Iraq, they held up fake anthrax and at least said, well, here's a truck that makes anthrax, which it didn't.
[00:20:24.494 --> 00:20:31.879]  It was actually a truck that pumped up hydrogen balloons to direct artillery that the US and British had sold Saddam in the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s.
[00:20:34.628 --> 00:20:38.551]  But the point is, is that the State Department thinks the public doesn't research or know any of this.
[00:20:39.011 --> 00:20:51.199]  So they just get up there and they say, hey, we're telling you this is a classified statement, we're not going to give you any evidence that Russia is making a movie about a false flag they're going to stage.
[00:20:51.219 --> 00:20:52.960]  And they're like, wow, you got those specifics?
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:53.660]  Tell us!
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:54.521]  Let us see it!
[00:20:54.801 --> 00:20:56.242]  Oh no, we can't let you see that.
[00:20:58.663 --> 00:21:05.341]   Now the truth is, Tens of billions of dollars of high-tech weapons, anti-tank, anti-aircraft have been shipped in the last two years.
[00:21:05.721 --> 00:21:07.262]  And Putin said, you're massing troops.
[00:21:07.582 --> 00:21:10.083]  I know army guys that just came back from there.
[00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:13.044]  They were literally in fights with the Russians, the little green men.
[00:21:13.444 --> 00:21:14.685]  We're losing troops, they're losing troops.
[00:21:14.965 --> 00:21:17.306]  We're in a proxy war with the Russians.
[00:21:17.806 --> 00:21:19.447]  And by the way, Trump basically expanded it.
[00:21:19.867 --> 00:21:21.127]  It was one of the bad things he did.
[00:21:22.568 --> 00:21:34.510]   And so, the Russians are massing troops in Belarus and other areas saying, listen, you keep saying You want to be peaceful, but you're moving people in and weapons in, and you've got proxy armies attacking us.
[00:21:35.991 --> 00:21:39.853]  That's all Western weird psyops, and they show, here's the poor Ukrainians.
[00:21:40.114 --> 00:21:41.595]  They've got wooden guns.
[00:21:41.935 --> 00:21:43.956]  They don't have any weapons or know how to use them.
[00:21:44.197 --> 00:21:45.237]  That's all made up.
[00:21:45.457 --> 00:21:47.119]  They've got warehouses full of weapons.
[00:21:47.699 --> 00:21:50.861]  They just don't have people willing to go start a fight with the Russians.
[00:21:52.422 --> 00:21:54.624]  So they're shooting at each other at a half mile away.
[00:21:55.302 --> 00:21:58.883]  And sabotaging warehouses and blowing up chemical plants.
[00:21:58.963 --> 00:22:06.524]  And both sides are tit for tatting back and forth on the borders of eastern and western Ukraine.
[00:22:08.144 --> 00:22:09.785]  And so I'm not lionizing Russia.
[00:22:09.805 --> 00:22:10.845]  I'm not saying Russia's perfect.
[00:22:11.465 --> 00:22:17.366]  I'm saying that you're watching this piece we'll get to a little bit later in the hour after I hit the big news.
[00:22:18.306 --> 00:22:21.367]  And the AP reporter thinks he scores this big Michael Jordan slam dunk.
[00:22:22.313 --> 00:22:25.535]  He goes, you're going into Alex Jones territory here with all your false flags.
[00:22:27.316 --> 00:22:30.178]  You and Psaki say they're going to stage a false flag.
[00:22:30.618 --> 00:22:31.859]  You don't have evidence of that.
[00:22:33.119 --> 00:22:35.781]  And the media is like, oh boy, got a big score in.
[00:22:35.801 --> 00:22:36.421]  Where's the proof?
[00:22:36.662 --> 00:22:37.302]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:22:37.502 --> 00:22:42.045]  The difference is when Alex Jones tells you something might be a false flag, I've got evidence and reasons.
[00:22:42.125 --> 00:22:49.029]  And I'm questioning because a lot of times stuff isn't real, whether it's Jussie Smollett or whether it's Bubba Wallace or whether it's the Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:22:50.894 --> 00:22:53.455]  Or whether it's Roe v. Wade, that baby never died.
[00:22:53.515 --> 00:22:54.495]  They now admit it was fake.
[00:22:57.677 --> 00:23:02.699]  And I'd say 80% of the time, hate crimes and stuff that starts wars, you name it, staged.
[00:23:03.679 --> 00:23:05.120]  And all major governments do it.
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:14.023]  It's in mainline history books that the French and the British constantly staged false flags on each other in the 500 years of wars they had.
[00:23:14.903 --> 00:23:15.564]  It's what you do.
[00:23:18.265 --> 00:23:21.803]   Because War's dirty.
[00:23:23.164 --> 00:23:24.465]  And I'm not defending dirtiness.
[00:23:24.545 --> 00:23:27.246]  I'm just telling you that people should actually know how war works.
[00:23:27.266 --> 00:23:28.587]  You should actually know how wars start.
[00:23:29.988 --> 00:23:30.968]  But instead they talk down to you.
[00:23:31.128 --> 00:23:36.731]  Oh, it's Alex Jones territory to think that if the Russians were going to invade, they'd stage a provocation.
[00:23:36.992 --> 00:23:38.332]  Yeah, you bet they would.
[00:23:38.732 --> 00:23:39.593]  And you bet the U.S.
[00:23:39.653 --> 00:23:41.794]  military would if they get the order to go in.
[00:23:42.775 --> 00:23:45.116]  You're just going to attack the Russians without staging something?
[00:23:46.519 --> 00:23:47.400]  What, you don't think the U.S.
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.503]  government had to stage plenty of stuff, like the USS Maine, to start the Spanish-American War?
[00:23:51.523 --> 00:23:54.985]  Grow up, people!
[00:23:55.005 --> 00:24:01.390]  It's like in The Godfather, when she says to Michael Kirlian, she goes, he goes, you know, presidents have people killed, I have people killed.
[00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:02.951]  She goes, presidents don't have people killed!
[00:24:03.931 --> 00:24:05.673]  He says, Kay, look who's being naive.
[00:24:06.473 --> 00:24:07.834]  Let's just stop being naive, people.
[00:24:08.034 --> 00:24:08.915]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:24:10.012 --> 00:24:14.393]  So, we know that HIV was a lab-grown, developed weapon.
[00:24:14.693 --> 00:24:16.994]  The evidence scientists, all the information came out.
[00:24:17.934 --> 00:24:22.415]  Since then, top scientists with modern systems have scanned it and said, yes, it's man-made.
[00:24:23.455 --> 00:24:34.378]  Fauci owns, along with the consortium, but he's the majority owner, the patent on the isolated HIV spike protein.
[00:24:35.898 --> 00:24:52.672]   And so, All the different Wuhan lab testing and development of a whole class of viruses, of chimeric viruses, used that spike protein that they'd already developed as the main weapon system.
[00:24:53.706 --> 00:25:10.217]  A natural spike protein they'd found that they had then bred and through generations in animals and humans to create a particularly rhinoceros-like virus that just, half the virus is the giant spike that gets into those receptor sites into the cells.
[00:25:10.578 --> 00:25:15.161]  So it's the cannon that fires the poison.
[00:25:15.221 --> 00:25:17.422]  It's the fangs that inject it.
[00:25:19.163 --> 00:25:20.484]  So that's all there.
[00:25:20.985 --> 00:25:24.747]   I mean, this guy is a Modern Joseph Mingala.
[00:25:24.787 --> 00:25:27.089]  He makes Joseph Mingala look like an amateur.
[00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:28.750]  Amateur.
[00:25:31.112 --> 00:25:32.153]  Absolutely amateur.
[00:25:33.654 --> 00:25:35.655]  Compared to what Fauci's done and the scale he's done.
[00:25:35.675 --> 00:25:37.937]  In fact, it's not fair to call him Joseph Mingala.
[00:25:38.257 --> 00:25:40.138]  Joseph Mingala had nothing on him.
[00:25:41.179 --> 00:25:43.641]  And he's just one of the operatives of these mad scientists involved.
[00:25:43.661 --> 00:25:44.802]  They're all involved at the top.
[00:25:45.919 --> 00:25:47.340]  Google's chief scientist, all of them.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.741]  So, let's look at this.
[00:25:50.241 --> 00:25:53.043]  New HIV strain found in the Netherlands.
[00:25:53.463 --> 00:25:54.964]  Highly infectious variant.
[00:25:55.384 --> 00:25:57.105]  Makes people ill twice as quick.
[00:25:57.866 --> 00:26:00.447]  Oh, and it's strangely connected to COVID, they're telling us.
[00:26:01.048 --> 00:26:05.010]  This is just the cover story, of course, put out by MI6 at the Daily Mail.
[00:26:06.483 --> 00:26:15.808]  A new super mutant HIV strain that makes infected individuals ill twice as fast as current versions of the virus has been detected in the Netherlands.
[00:26:16.388 --> 00:26:23.491]  The new mutant, called the VB variant, has infected at least 109 people according to a study by Oxford University.
[00:26:23.631 --> 00:26:24.272]  Oh my goodness!
[00:26:25.092 --> 00:26:33.236]  The strain damages the immune system and weakens a person's ability to fight everyday infections and diseases faster than previous versions of the virus.
[00:26:33.965 --> 00:26:35.506]  Now, what is now confirmed?
[00:26:35.566 --> 00:26:43.392]  Because they have this lie that Fauci said a year ago, people in the hospital, 99% dying have not had the vaccine.
[00:26:44.132 --> 00:26:45.373]  Total lie, been proven so.
[00:26:45.753 --> 00:26:48.455]  Now they say, oh, 90% of the hospitalizations are that.
[00:26:48.675 --> 00:26:50.416]  They just repeat it, never giving you a source.
[00:26:50.717 --> 00:26:51.197]  It's made up.
[00:26:54.159 --> 00:26:59.543]  But the vaccine itself, it's a gene therapy, does turn off your killer T's.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.361]  It continues.
[00:27:02.441 --> 00:27:13.670]  So a lot of this is, oh, you're sick, you have HIV, and now they've got tests that are tailored where when they test you, you've had COVID-19 from the lab leak, the lab release, or you've had it from the vaccine.
[00:27:14.231 --> 00:27:18.434]  We've had top scientists on, does the exact same thing, because the shots are even worse than actually catching it.
[00:27:18.634 --> 00:27:21.846]   You get a larger load and it Tends to replicate better in the body.
[00:27:22.246 --> 00:27:26.388]  And then now they skew the test over before to not call it HIV.
[00:27:26.428 --> 00:27:28.629]  Now they change the test and go, Oh my God!
[00:27:28.649 --> 00:27:29.810]  This is happening.
[00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:44.057]  It's all over the news like Houston, Texas record HIV, LA record HIV, New York, Detroit, Miami, London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Durban, Mexico City.
[00:27:45.922 --> 00:27:55.289]  Rio de Janeiro, just type it in, record HIV, and it's worse, and it's bad, and they get fevers, and their immune system's gone, and they die, and they get cancer real quick.
[00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.752]  What have we been saying 85 billion times on air?
[00:27:58.872 --> 00:27:59.532]  Let's not exaggerate.
[00:27:59.552 --> 00:28:01.754]  5,000, 10,000 times in the last two years?
[00:28:02.094 --> 00:28:05.657]  Myself, Mike Adams, Dr. Boyle, bunch of medical doctors.
[00:28:07.338 --> 00:28:09.280]  These shots will turn your immune system off.
[00:28:10.399 --> 00:28:15.343]  And then you get cancer, or you can jack it way up, the way it's designed, and they call it ADE.
[00:28:15.883 --> 00:28:17.364]  Antibody Dependency Enhancement.
[00:28:20.426 --> 00:28:21.907]  So, oh my gosh!
[00:28:22.408 --> 00:28:27.151]  The virus and the vaccine creates the HIV spike protein.
[00:28:27.631 --> 00:28:36.842]   You set the test to either not pick up the spike protein, so people don't get scared they've been given HIV, Or then when you want to tell them, "Oh, now the new plague
[00:28:36.842 --> 00:28:40.922]  is super HIV that just showed up everywhere."
[00:28:40.922 --> 00:28:45.161]  [Laughter]
[00:28:45.161 --> 00:28:46.161]  [Inhales]
[00:28:46.161 --> 00:28:48.161]  Wow!
[00:28:47.915 --> 00:28:49.176]  Wow.
[00:28:49.556 --> 00:28:50.797]  Isn't that just sick?
[00:28:53.519 --> 00:28:56.222]  And if you're dumb enough to take it, I guess they think you deserve it.
[00:28:59.184 --> 00:28:59.985]  But the children don't.
[00:29:01.923 --> 00:29:03.404]  And you're like, well, I just won't take the shot.
[00:29:03.484 --> 00:29:04.005]  It doesn't matter.
[00:29:04.045 --> 00:29:05.986]  These bodies then breed it and replicate it.
[00:29:06.006 --> 00:29:07.468]  Get the Dr. Malone clip from two days ago.
[00:29:07.488 --> 00:29:07.968]  I never played.
[00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:09.769]  Ready, guys?
[00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:11.311]  Remember Malone?
[00:29:11.671 --> 00:29:12.572]  He said this two years ago.
[00:29:12.592 --> 00:29:13.252]  The inventor of mRNA.
[00:29:13.292 --> 00:29:14.333]  And he said it again a year ago.
[00:29:14.393 --> 00:29:15.134]  Said it again a month ago.
[00:29:15.414 --> 00:29:16.134]  Said it again this week.
[00:29:17.155 --> 00:29:17.996]  Had this clip since Monday.
[00:29:18.036 --> 00:29:18.636]  Haven't played it yet.
[00:29:19.437 --> 00:29:21.078]  He says, listen, I don't want to fearmonger here.
[00:29:21.318 --> 00:29:22.319]  So he dials it way down.
[00:29:22.359 --> 00:29:29.445]  He goes, but when you give billions of people a shot while they have a virus, it causes it to mutate, become more aggressive.
[00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:33.552]  Normally, if somebody has a virus, it mutates and becomes less aggressive.
[00:29:34.453 --> 00:29:35.073]  That's what they do.
[00:29:35.394 --> 00:29:47.482]  But when you, when you, during a big outbreak, go give people something like this that then goes and suppresses it, it then causes it to spike worse and become more powerful, just like bugs becoming resistant to pesticides.
[00:29:48.863 --> 00:29:54.267]  You know, the Nietzschean saying, that which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:29:54.627 --> 00:29:59.696]   So let me just show you a few back, Headlines this took the crew about two minutes or before the show.
[00:30:00.096 --> 00:30:24.982]   I said just go search engine InfoWars HIV COVID-19 And they got dozens of articles from January of 2020 two years ago plus but here's the whole headline About the super deadly kills you really quick spreads really easy might be able just to touch somebody and get it Because it's COVID-19, it's the vaccine.
[00:30:25.142 --> 00:30:26.363]  It's what it does.
[00:30:26.683 --> 00:30:34.448]  It's another form of HIV that turns on your own immune system.
[00:30:36.209 --> 00:30:36.949]  Look at this one.
[00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:48.116]  February 3rd, Dr. Francis Boyle, creator of BioWeapons, acts as coronavirus' bio-welfare weapon, and then he links it to HIV and says it'll have AIDS-like effects on people.
[00:30:48.576 --> 00:30:53.139]  That is a big, detailed report right there for you.
[00:30:55.479 --> 00:30:58.301]  Israel's study offers strongest proof yet of vitamin D's power.
[00:30:58.361 --> 00:30:59.562]  Oops, that should have been in the stack.
[00:30:59.722 --> 00:31:00.983]  No, evil vitamin D. Get away.
[00:31:01.764 --> 00:31:02.204]  Here's another one.
[00:31:02.305 --> 00:31:07.389]  Australia cancels COVID vaccine trial over unexpected false positives for HIV.
[00:31:07.649 --> 00:31:10.331]  Then they just tell them, ignore those, ignore those.
[00:31:10.531 --> 00:31:12.953]  But now they think you've forgotten, so now they're going to tell you what they didn't tell you.
[00:31:13.794 --> 00:31:16.035]  That's Zero Hedge with links to the Australian News.
[00:31:17.436 --> 00:31:22.300]  Indian scientists discover coronavirus engineered with HIV-AIDS-like insertions.
[00:31:23.441 --> 00:31:29.990]   February 1st, 2020.
[00:31:29.009 --> 00:31:29.990]  India Newswire.
[00:31:31.071 --> 00:31:33.874]  HIV in the vaccine.
[00:31:35.956 --> 00:31:40.360]  Australia scraps COVID-19 vaccine that produced HIV false positives.
[00:31:40.781 --> 00:31:42.262]  Oh, but now they're going to tell you.
[00:31:43.223 --> 00:31:43.924]  That's New York Times.
[00:31:44.244 --> 00:31:48.909]  At gatherings of HIV AIDS pioneers, raw memories mixed with current conflicts.
[00:31:51.323 --> 00:31:56.847]  Soros joins World Health Group to battle drug-resistant TB HIV explosion.
[00:31:56.887 --> 00:31:57.307]  Yes.
[00:31:58.748 --> 00:32:02.991]  Scientists discover HIV-like mutation which makes coronavirus extremely infectious.
[00:32:03.351 --> 00:32:09.675]  Oh, it's a HIV-like mutation welded directly on and Fauci owns the patent to doing that.
[00:32:09.875 --> 00:32:10.576]  Just no big deal.
[00:32:13.334 --> 00:32:13.734]  COVID!
[00:32:13.774 --> 00:32:16.655]  Australian vaccine abandoned over false HIV response.
[00:32:16.935 --> 00:32:19.516]  Oh, but two years later, it's like, actually, it's no big deal.
[00:32:19.616 --> 00:32:20.616]  Oh, yeah, you got it.
[00:32:21.256 --> 00:32:23.156]  Scientists discover HIV-like mutation.
[00:32:23.196 --> 00:32:24.157]  Goes on and on.
[00:32:24.716 --> 00:32:26.716]  That's a News Wars article.
[00:32:26.716 --> 00:32:32.716]  Info Wars, February 26th.
[00:32:32.879 --> 00:32:38.080]  Scientists discover HIV-like mutation in the virus.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:39.841]  Here's one.
[00:32:40.121 --> 00:32:43.141]   Info Wars, January 31st, 2020.
[00:32:44.021 --> 00:32:45.702]  That's first, folks.
[00:32:47.262 --> 00:32:49.523]  Coronavirus contains HIV insertions.
[00:32:49.883 --> 00:32:51.864]  Stoke fears of artificially created bioweapon.
[00:32:52.104 --> 00:32:52.224]  Oh.
[00:32:55.965 --> 00:32:58.646]  Indian scientists discover coronavirus engineered with HIV.
[00:33:02.447 --> 00:33:03.207]  And it just goes on.
[00:33:05.569 --> 00:33:11.693]  And of course, Bayer says it settled decades-old HIV-tainted blood cases where they gave millions of people HIV on purpose.
[00:33:12.273 --> 00:33:12.413]  Hmm.
[00:33:12.854 --> 00:33:13.394]  NBC News.
[00:33:14.235 --> 00:33:15.115]  So they've done this before.
[00:33:15.135 --> 00:33:17.056]  They're doing it on a much bigger scale now.
[00:33:17.457 --> 00:33:21.959]  And people better wake up to this and understand that it's being injected in you with the vaccine.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:27.083]  People are being given an AIDS-like disease with the vaccine, and now the hospitals are full of the dead and dying.
[00:33:27.103 --> 00:33:27.903]  It's going to get a lot worse.
[00:33:28.343 --> 00:33:28.904]  Very, very sick.
[00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:36.293]  Sick evolution to a state where it may be more pathogenic and more able to elude immune response.
[00:33:37.253 --> 00:33:41.815]  So in sum, I don't wish to scare, we've had enough fear porn.
[00:33:42.996 --> 00:33:58.943]  But if we continue to pursue universal vaccination, the high probability is that what we will continue to see is the evolution of additional escape mutants that are increasingly infectious and may well become more pathogenic.
[00:34:00.239 --> 00:34:10.245]  This policy of forced universal vaccination is absolutely contrary to all of our understanding about basic viral evolution.
[00:34:10.926 --> 00:34:15.789]  We are clearly seeing the development of escape mutants that are resistant to the vaccine.
[00:34:16.549 --> 00:34:22.553]  Omicron is not only resistant to the vaccine, but its infectivity seems to be facilitated by the vaccine.
[00:34:23.573 --> 00:34:28.236]  And in my opinion, this must stop for the sake of the world.
[00:34:29.037 --> 00:34:29.177]  Over.
[00:34:30.038 --> 00:34:33.801]  I'm going to boil this down very, very simply on the Alex Jones Show on this Friday edition.
[00:34:36.724 --> 00:34:40.086]  Christians believe in treating everybody good and standing up for the innocent.
[00:34:40.867 --> 00:34:42.668]  Pagans believe in survival of the fittest.
[00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:50.815]  And they believe that if you can dominate and control and kill people and exercise your will, it means that you have a right to do it and you're making the world a better place.
[00:34:53.717 --> 00:34:55.639]  And there's arguments for both schools of thought.
[00:34:58.208 --> 00:35:01.171]  But at the end of the day, the globalists aren't even doing survival of the fittest to empower us.
[00:35:01.211 --> 00:35:05.235]  They're doing it to end humanity as we know it.
[00:35:07.897 --> 00:35:12.702]  So you wonder why Fauci and these globalists have released a new version of HIV as a vaccine.
[00:35:14.604 --> 00:35:16.125]  And remember how they attacked me two years ago.
[00:35:16.185 --> 00:35:21.571]  Jones is claiming that it was made in a lab connected to HIV and that the vaccine will give you HIV.
[00:35:24.229 --> 00:35:31.331]  I don't know, that's just, you know, the owner and the creator of it, the guy that owns the Spike Pro team, and the guy that ran the lab, and the guy that says he wants to kill you and your family.
[00:35:31.751 --> 00:35:34.051]  On record, Bill Gates and Fauci want to depopulate you.
[00:35:34.231 --> 00:35:37.012]  They go to depopulation summons and talk about how they want to kill everybody.
[00:35:37.292 --> 00:35:37.712]  And they are!
[00:35:37.732 --> 00:35:41.353]  I mean, you gotta respect the fact that they're actually doing what they said they'd do.
[00:35:41.713 --> 00:35:42.893]  I'm just going off what they say.
[00:35:44.213 --> 00:35:44.713]  What they do.
[00:35:45.253 --> 00:35:45.934]  Their track record.
[00:35:45.974 --> 00:35:47.414]  They've killed before, they're killing again.
[00:35:50.052 --> 00:35:50.412]  Ms.
[00:35:50.552 --> 00:35:54.833]  French, his ex-wife, I think, probably wasn't read in on the whole thing.
[00:35:55.193 --> 00:36:00.374]  And she's decided to go hide, and totally pull out of the foundation, and stop funding all the eugenics.
[00:36:04.174 --> 00:36:04.815]  That's good.
[00:36:05.855 --> 00:36:06.535]  That's real good.
[00:36:10.636 --> 00:36:17.017]  Because you're on a collision course with us, and we're in a civil war against the devil worshippers and those that love Christ.
[00:36:17.517 --> 00:36:18.797]  That's the real civil war on this planet.
[00:36:19.701 --> 00:36:20.541]  It's a war against God.
[00:36:22.342 --> 00:36:25.864]  And just now the evil people are figuring out this isn't going to be the cakewalk they thought it was.
[00:36:26.224 --> 00:36:28.945]  Because they know we're not going to turn off in this game of chicken.
[00:36:30.666 --> 00:36:33.767]  And now they're going to have to bite the bullet like big boys.
[00:36:35.368 --> 00:36:36.288]  Like big boys.
[00:36:37.509 --> 00:36:42.311]  Do you think you're just going to kill little kids and poison everybody and dumb everybody down and get away with this?
[00:36:42.431 --> 00:36:42.671]  No.
[00:36:43.551 --> 00:36:46.813]  You're going to have to face retribution.
[00:36:51.562 --> 00:37:03.928]  Real justice, not the type handed out by your corrupt courts and the Justice Department, but the intergalactic, interdimensional, multiverse judgment of the big guy, the kahuna, the maker, the master.
[00:37:04.928 --> 00:37:15.233]  You keep playing like you're God all day, pretending like you are the force of nature that's here to call us little mere humans, and we just have to sit here while you kill us.
[00:37:15.253 --> 00:37:17.033]  That's not how the world works.
[00:37:17.053 --> 00:37:18.014]  That's not how the ball bounces.
[00:37:19.975 --> 00:37:33.418]  So after McCullough leaves us, this is going to be a big interview where he exclusively counters all the disinformation and lies in the media attacking him predominantly and Dr. Malone from the Joe Rogan megaviral interviews.
[00:37:37.304 --> 00:37:39.786]  I'll get more into this because there's a lot to cover.
[00:37:40.567 --> 00:37:43.230]  And so we'll do this the last 30 minutes of the third hour.
[00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:44.351]  We'll do an hour and a half of McCullough.
[00:37:44.671 --> 00:37:48.394]  Then I'll be able to really spend, I mean, we need to spend a lot of time on this.
[00:37:48.455 --> 00:37:52.398]  And it's not because it became the top news story in the US yesterday.
[00:37:53.579 --> 00:37:58.244]  Seriously, like thousands of articles, tens of millions of views.
[00:37:59.645 --> 00:38:07.652]  Per video, I mean, one is like 10 million, 5 million, I wasn't even trying to find them, it's just everywhere, like 10 million, 5 million, 3 million, 2 million, on every news channel.
[00:38:07.892 --> 00:38:08.852]  Ha ha, look!
[00:38:09.253 --> 00:38:10.554]  They want war with Russia!
[00:38:11.495 --> 00:38:18.140]  And the State Department wouldn't give any evidence, and we're talking about false flags, that's Alex Jones territory, because you know, false flags don't exist.
[00:38:18.881 --> 00:38:20.342]  No, false flags are a very real thing.
[00:38:20.362 --> 00:38:25.506]  The difference is when I talk about false flags, I give you evidence and history and background.
[00:38:26.384 --> 00:38:28.467]  And I look at big events and say, could they be a false flag?
[00:38:28.487 --> 00:38:30.169]  A lot of times they are, sometimes they're not.
[00:38:31.171 --> 00:38:35.156]  Most of the time we've been right, sometimes we've been wrong, questioning false flags, or potential false flags.
[00:38:35.196 --> 00:38:36.198]  And I don't apologize for that.
[00:38:38.701 --> 00:38:43.608]  But they don't want you, the little people, when there's a big event to ask, who actually stands to gain from this?
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:53.283]  So we got Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, the Wall Street Journal, the BBC, the London Telegraph, the Moscow Times.
[00:38:53.303 --> 00:38:54.723]  They all have this.
[00:38:54.763 --> 00:38:56.384]  This is one of the biggest stories in the world.
[00:38:59.305 --> 00:39:04.507]  The AP reporter is sitting there asking the State Department spokesman, what is your evidence?
[00:39:04.827 --> 00:39:05.728]  You're not like Kennedy.
[00:39:05.748 --> 00:39:07.448]  That's what the reporter should have said.
[00:39:07.989 --> 00:39:16.469]   you know, showing us the photos of the medium range nuke missiles in Cuba in 1961, 62.
[00:39:16.469 --> 00:39:23.989]  They didn't say, "Hey, show us documents."
[00:39:24.242 --> 00:39:25.642]  He just said, Hey, give me something.
[00:39:25.722 --> 00:39:30.223]  And I goes, well, I just told you, you know, kind of like saving effective.
[00:39:30.263 --> 00:39:31.144]  You take the vaccine.
[00:39:31.164 --> 00:39:34.785]  Uh, you can't transmit it to other people, which was not true.
[00:39:36.165 --> 00:39:38.406]  They just want us to believe them.
[00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:53.057]  And so, you know, it's very true that we are in Alex Jones territory, where we actually learn about history, learn how things work, do our own research, instead of being an expert on football or baseball or basketball, which I'm not against people that like that, but you know, their whole lives they're knowing everything about it.
[00:39:53.718 --> 00:39:57.460]  And where the players all live and what they eat for breakfast and what their wife's name is.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.221]  That doesn't help you in the world.
[00:39:59.661 --> 00:40:07.085]  Knowing about geopolitics and the private Federal Reserve and the Uyghurs and the New World Order and nanotech, that's important.
[00:40:07.665 --> 00:40:08.886]  And how the power grid works.
[00:40:10.615 --> 00:40:13.636]  And how under law they're putting kill switches in all the cars now.
[00:40:13.776 --> 00:40:14.577]  Isn't that a big deal?
[00:40:14.777 --> 00:40:15.737]  What do you think that's for?
[00:40:17.238 --> 00:40:21.320]  When you try to go have an Ottawa demonstration against the lockdowns, well we just turn your car off.
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.501]  They're putting the kill switches in everything.
[00:40:23.781 --> 00:40:25.242]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:40:29.103 --> 00:40:30.844]  So I'll play the whole exchange coming up.
[00:40:32.065 --> 00:40:42.818]   Maybe you guys real quick just queue up to the middle where they do the little Alex Jones thing, but the whole exchange is six minutes long and I really want to air the whole thing because It is new for them to give no evidence.
[00:40:42.878 --> 00:40:58.695]  I mean, in front of the UN in 2003 to launch that fake phase of the war, Colin Powell holds up fake anthrax, wasn't even real, puts up pictures of trucks that were pumping up balloons, artillery, hydrogen balloons.
[00:40:58.715 --> 00:41:01.498]  They didn't have drones back then in the 80s.
[00:41:02.603 --> 00:41:04.524]  Or at least drones that you can put in a battlefield easily.
[00:41:05.044 --> 00:41:12.268]  And so you just run a balloon up of hydrogen, and it would have cameras on it in a truck that would transmit that back to the generals to direct their artillery.
[00:41:13.248 --> 00:41:19.691]  And he puts up the artillery balloon truck, and he goes, and this is where they make the anthrax.
[00:41:20.292 --> 00:41:23.633]  Of course, anybody can go to a Jane's Weapons Quarterly and look up that exact truck.
[00:41:23.693 --> 00:41:24.454]  We did, by the way.
[00:41:24.494 --> 00:41:25.254]  I was on the air then.
[00:41:25.274 --> 00:41:26.775]  And we actually broke that.
[00:41:26.795 --> 00:41:40.981]   We're like, that's a Jane's Weapons Quarterly Balloon truck for anti-aircraft and not an aircraft for artillery direction.
[00:41:41.382 --> 00:41:45.264]  The point I'm getting at here is is that they don't want you to know how this works.
[00:41:45.744 --> 00:41:47.525]  They don't want you to think about how this works.
[00:41:48.105 --> 00:41:51.387]  They don't want you to be aware of any of this information.
[00:41:54.838 --> 00:41:59.600]  Yeah, now the Pentagon's using radar balloon network to track cars in six Midwestern states.
[00:42:00.081 --> 00:42:11.206]  I mean, this is a military-industrial complex out of control that Eisenhower told us about that is just gobbling up like a cancer and eating America and eating our troops and eating our sovereignty.
[00:42:11.906 --> 00:42:13.327]  It's not our military at the top.
[00:42:13.627 --> 00:42:16.648]  It's globalist traitors that tell you white people are the main enemy.
[00:42:17.169 --> 00:42:19.550]  That's the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the ADL.
[00:42:22.762 --> 00:42:23.602]  They're Hitlerian.
[00:42:24.103 --> 00:42:27.444]  They're bringing you a race based system of discrimination and evil.
[00:42:29.305 --> 00:42:30.365]  So that's all coming up.
[00:42:30.465 --> 00:42:38.989]  But I mean, it just really is insane that this isn't Alex Jones territory in that the guy gave no evidence or any history or any background.
[00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:47.252]  But it is Alex Jones territory that now they've so discredited talking about false flags, even though they're a real part of human history.
[00:42:49.423 --> 00:42:56.453]  That now when someone tries to say the Russians might do a false flag, that can't even be brought up because that's a term you're not allowed to talk about.
[00:42:56.673 --> 00:43:05.485]  That's the level of political correctness where they're not just banning words like, oh, we got to ban Lynch Hall because lynching might scare somebody.
[00:43:08.132 --> 00:43:18.015]  To words like mother and father scare me, oh ban them, to you can't talk about a known thing in history that the Russians might stage an attack on themselves as a pretext to come in.
[00:43:18.035 --> 00:43:19.076]  I mean, that's possible.
[00:43:20.096 --> 00:43:23.417]  The West does it more often and it is more corrupt in my view right now.
[00:43:23.677 --> 00:43:26.338]  But the point is, this is a real thing being discussed.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:28.941]  Of course they're probably lying about it.
[00:43:29.201 --> 00:43:30.922]  Russia doesn't have a motive to go into Ukraine.
[00:43:31.482 --> 00:43:42.308]  Troops and weapons are being massed in Ukraine to push the Russians out of Crimea that they took in 2014 that is their historic land and their main oil pipelines.
[00:43:43.055 --> 00:43:45.977]  And the West is already trying to cut off their pipelines into Europe right now.
[00:43:46.197 --> 00:43:47.278]  The old ones and the new ones.
[00:43:47.678 --> 00:43:48.618]  But see, I'm a weirdo.
[00:43:48.879 --> 00:43:50.019]  I know the old pipelines.
[00:43:50.139 --> 00:43:51.100]  I know the Nord Stream.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.901]  I know the big communication cables.
[00:43:53.361 --> 00:43:53.982]  I'm a weirdo.
[00:43:54.262 --> 00:43:59.925]  I don't know the sports scores of your favorite baseball player, but I know the names of some of the big cables.
[00:44:00.546 --> 00:44:01.987]  I know the satellite networks.
[00:44:02.247 --> 00:44:05.389]  I know how many satellites Elon Musk has put up.
[00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:07.230]  I mean, I'm into stuff like that.
[00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:08.631]  I'm a weirdo.
[00:44:11.784 --> 00:44:13.687]  And I want you to know about all that.
[00:44:14.128 --> 00:44:18.454]  And so coming up after Dr. McCullough leaves us, we're going to play the club and get into all of it.
[00:44:18.494 --> 00:44:20.377]  But it's a wild world, folks.
[00:44:22.227 --> 00:44:22.928]  We're going to go to break.
[00:44:22.988 --> 00:44:31.237]  Please don't forget, you've only got nine days until the 13th to get 25% off of the highest quality, affordable food you're going to find out there for anywhere near this price.
[00:44:31.257 --> 00:44:32.458]  It's what I've got for my family.
[00:44:32.618 --> 00:44:33.279]  It's what I use.
[00:44:33.479 --> 00:44:35.321]  And at this price, they haven't offered this in four years.
[00:44:35.341 --> 00:44:36.723]  You're not going to see this for a long time.
[00:44:36.743 --> 00:44:37.884]  They're ready to ship to you right now.
[00:44:38.224 --> 00:44:43.950]  PrepareWithAlex.com, PrepareWithAlex.com or InfoWarsTore.com has the direct links right there.
[00:44:44.211 --> 00:44:46.278]   And Today is the final day.
[00:44:46.318 --> 00:44:54.305]  We might extend it into Sunday, but this weekend's the last time to get 50% off on our new amazing course and in breakdown analysis.
[00:44:54.185 --> 00:45:10.185]  It's beyond the course at resetwars.com.
[00:45:10.185 --> 00:45:11.524]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:11.477 --> 00:45:23.909]  To take on the establishment with a lot of bombshell information, new developments, and also countering the corporate media that's on the payroll of Big Pharma, lying and saying that he gave out this information without ever giving any specifics.
[00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:29.915]  Who's going to respond to the big Joe Rogan controversy coming up here in just a moment?
[00:45:29.995 --> 00:45:32.578]  Greg Reese has filed a new report I want to get to.
[00:45:33.894 --> 00:45:39.498]  Right now, and there's such big developments with the convoy in Canada and the truckers on the border with Canada and everything.
[00:45:39.538 --> 00:45:40.519]  It's beautiful what's happening.
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:42.621]  They're talking about using the military on them now.
[00:45:42.681 --> 00:45:44.662]  That'll definitely backfire.
[00:45:44.682 --> 00:45:45.883]  We've got that information.
[00:45:46.424 --> 00:45:53.809]  We've got Dem Senator Ben Ray Lugin suffers stroke at age 49, halting Dem's slim majority.
[00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:57.773]  He's so sick and so ill after he got his third shot.
[00:45:59.406 --> 00:46:00.987]  You know, I saw the OAN statement.
[00:46:01.027 --> 00:46:03.128]  Others may get, hey, liberals, please take more shots.
[00:46:03.448 --> 00:46:04.229]  Please take boosters.
[00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:06.570]  I understand it's a turn of phrase.
[00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:08.952]  We don't mean it, but this is really serious.
[00:46:09.612 --> 00:46:18.977]  But I would tell them before they want to make children take it who aren't of age and can't make a decision for themselves, I would ask people that are wanting to hurt the children because they think there's too many people on the planet.
[00:46:19.978 --> 00:46:20.538]  Kill yourselves.
[00:46:21.059 --> 00:46:21.399]  Seriously.
[00:46:22.459 --> 00:46:25.761]  I mean, if there's too many people, show us how you do it.
[00:46:26.302 --> 00:46:26.762]  Bill Gates.
[00:46:27.907 --> 00:46:28.988]  I don't wish any harm upon you.
[00:46:29.008 --> 00:46:29.988]  I'm not going to attack you myself.
[00:46:30.048 --> 00:46:30.608]  Nobody should.
[00:46:30.909 --> 00:46:36.071]  But if you want to pour gasoline all over yourself on national television, you already pay for most of the media.
[00:46:36.091 --> 00:46:41.714]  You buy all the channels for an hour, come on every channel in the world that's corporate, and then just pour gasoline on yourselves.
[00:46:41.734 --> 00:46:42.494]  There's too many people.
[00:46:42.954 --> 00:46:50.638]  And I mean to show you that I mean to act by example, lead by example, just strike the match, self-immolate, and I will really respect Bill Gates.
[00:46:50.758 --> 00:46:57.758]  Here's Greg Rees's report.
[00:46:57.758 --> 00:47:08.758]   If the government served the people, then the government would have nothing to fear from the people.
[00:47:09.011 --> 00:47:10.956]  But it is clear that now the government fears us.
[00:47:12.373 --> 00:47:20.280]  After years of persistent abuse of the Constitution, during which time they have betrayed, robbed, injured and killed the Australian people, we have had enough.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:21.641]  And we are not alone.
[00:47:22.301 --> 00:47:28.767]  Internationally, the people are rising up peacefully against the unlawful and criminal excesses of those whom they have elected.
[00:47:29.207 --> 00:47:34.791]  Millions of good and decent men and women around the world have decided that this war for the world must end.
[00:47:35.292 --> 00:47:39.996]  And they know it will end when enough of us stand up and declare, in one voice, no more.
[00:47:41.098 --> 00:47:57.267]  Here in Australia, the people are gathering in the nation's capital, Canberra, in order to communicate their intent that the Governor-General should meet his constitutional responsibility by dissolving the Parliament and appointing a new Executive Council in order to prepare for free and fair elections.
[00:47:58.387 --> 00:48:02.630]  In the long journey from barbarism to civilisation, days such as these are rare.
[00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:10.574]  Seminal days, when a people bands together, putting aside their petty differences in order to secure their lives and their liberty.
[00:48:11.551 --> 00:48:14.714]  In other words, to earn their rights to their sovereign nationhood.
[00:48:15.595 --> 00:48:18.798]  Now is the time to play your part in the liberation of Australia.
[00:48:18.858 --> 00:48:22.641]  Now is the time to stand alongside your fellow Australians and resist tyranny.
[00:48:23.242 --> 00:48:26.785]  Now is the time to ensure your children and grandchildren are free.
[00:48:27.586 --> 00:48:32.170]  You are here because generations ago your ancestors sacrificed all for you.
[00:48:32.551 --> 00:48:34.252]  It is now time to pay that debt forward.
[00:48:35.233 --> 00:48:36.975]  Now, nothing else matters.
[00:48:37.924 --> 00:48:39.084]  This is not about politics.
[00:48:39.184 --> 00:48:40.604]  This is a non-political event.
[00:48:40.985 --> 00:48:43.145]  This is about our very lives and our very future.
[00:48:43.605 --> 00:48:46.525]  You must drop everything and get to Canberra as soon as you can.
[00:48:47.166 --> 00:48:52.206]  Some have made their way from far afield as Adelaide, Melbourne and Rockhampton.
[00:48:53.207 --> 00:48:54.047]  What's your excuse?
[00:48:55.287 --> 00:48:57.607]  And they plan to stay until we win.
[00:48:58.908 --> 00:49:01.488]  Remain calm regardless of the force used against you.
[00:49:01.988 --> 00:49:07.069]  They will provoke a reaction which ultimately will see the use of police snipers opening fire.
[00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:09.430]  This is a reality.
[00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:15.592]  Regardless of the force used against you, you must, we must, remain calm in order to win.
[00:49:16.533 --> 00:49:21.754]  Fly, drive, walk if you must, but we need an army of millions in Canberra to win this war.
[00:49:22.134 --> 00:49:24.155]  And we will win if you attend.
[00:49:25.135 --> 00:49:26.977]  Pack up as much food and water as you can.
[00:49:27.257 --> 00:49:30.459]  The people already there are sharing and cooperating as never before.
[00:49:30.919 --> 00:49:33.001]  If you can't find accommodation, sleep in your car.
[00:49:33.441 --> 00:49:34.682]  We must come together now.
[00:49:35.242 --> 00:49:36.523]  This is our time.
[00:49:37.083 --> 00:49:37.704]  We the people.
[00:49:38.204 --> 00:49:40.766]  Do it for your family, and do it for the future of Australia.
[00:49:41.546 --> 00:49:42.387]  I'm Riccardo Bozzi.
[00:49:42.727 --> 00:49:43.868]  I'm looking forward to seeing you there.
[00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:52.114]  And they've now announced they're going to use the military against the truckers in Canada, which is going to blow up their face, just like Ceausescu in Romania.
[00:49:52.173 --> 00:49:59.173]  This is the fall of the New World Order.
[00:49:59.173 --> 00:50:07.974]   Experience the next level in high-powered energy nootropics with our latest BrainForce
[00:50:07.974 --> 00:50:10.052]  offering, BrainForce Ultra.

[00:51:03.438 --> 00:51:05.280]  Dr. Peter McCullough is our guest.
[00:51:06.158 --> 00:51:11.063]  And he's a cardiologist, very respected, run different government FDA study programs.
[00:51:11.823 --> 00:51:15.867]  And he went on Joe Rogan in late December and came on our show a few days later.
[00:51:16.548 --> 00:51:25.636]  And over the next three plus hours, he just laid out the science, the studies, the facts, citing them all, showing everything that he talked about.
[00:51:26.457 --> 00:51:32.087]   Then CNN and every other globalist establishment channel Literally.
[00:51:32.248 --> 00:51:33.028]  Attacked him.
[00:51:33.449 --> 00:51:35.470]  Then Dr. Malone came on, the inventor of mRNA.
[00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:36.271]  They attacked him.
[00:51:36.291 --> 00:51:40.354]  And just would never, though, specifically say what they said was wrong.
[00:51:40.715 --> 00:51:42.496]  They just say, they're crazy.
[00:51:42.856 --> 00:51:43.697]  They're kooks.
[00:51:44.037 --> 00:51:45.438]  They're giving out this information.
[00:51:45.679 --> 00:51:47.840]  But they never showed what it was.
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:51.123]  So I asked Dr. McCullough a couple weeks ago to please come on.
[00:51:51.163 --> 00:51:52.344]  He had time today.
[00:51:52.845 --> 00:51:58.809]  He was going to be here, but the I-35 from Dallas to Austin basically shut down in many areas from the snowstorm.
[00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:05.630]   but he joins us now and in the next hour and a half of time we have, we're gonna have a lot of B-roll.
[00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:11.349]   After he goes, we're gonna play some of the clips of the big anti-forced injection rally
[00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:13.530]  that happened a few weeks ago in D.C. and more.
[00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:19.550]   But I wanted him to first get into the Joe Rogan interview and it really seems like the tipping point
[00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:27.110]   and the attacks and the disinformation and how we counter these disinformation specialists
[00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:33.189]   that then project onto us and say we are the people involved in disinformation when we are showing people
[00:52:33.189 --> 00:52:34.490]  everything we're claiming.
[00:52:34.251 --> 00:52:36.093]  So, Dr. McCullough, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[00:52:37.034 --> 00:52:37.894]  Well, thanks for having me.
[00:52:38.895 --> 00:52:41.097]  Well, again, Dr. Peter McCullough is our guest.
[00:52:41.357 --> 00:52:44.720]  You can find him on Twitter at P underscore McCullough MD.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:46.421]  Where do you want to start here?
[00:52:48.115 --> 00:52:52.902]  Alex, I just wanted to tell the audience about the context of my Joe Rogan interview.
[00:52:53.302 --> 00:53:00.532]  Joe had reached out to me about a month in advance, and because of scheduling, it was about a month period of time for me to get down there.
[00:53:00.552 --> 00:53:01.954]  I was down there on December 8th.
[00:53:03.175 --> 00:53:11.602]  And, you know, I sent Joe a slide deck, a slide deck of all the data on COVID-19 that I had.
[00:53:11.662 --> 00:53:14.705]  In fact, a slide deck I've reviewed with your audience in studio.
[00:53:15.205 --> 00:53:27.015]  That slide deck was continuing medical education certified for a presentation at the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons meeting in October of 2021.
[00:53:27.235 --> 00:53:30.318]  So this was semi-certified.
[00:53:32.845 --> 00:53:34.706]  Every single slide was cited.
[00:53:35.627 --> 00:53:37.128]  All the evidence was there.
[00:53:37.688 --> 00:53:43.271]  And so I brought my computer in studio and I brought it and I showed Joe the slides and went over it.
[00:53:43.291 --> 00:53:44.832]  And, you know, Joe was the journalist.
[00:53:44.972 --> 00:53:47.053]  Joe did not offer any medical opinions.
[00:53:47.334 --> 00:53:49.615]  Neither did I. I simply was showing the data.
[00:53:49.655 --> 00:53:58.060]  I left the slide file as well as separate figures for his producers, you know, as I would with your studio.
[00:53:58.875 --> 00:54:07.677]  And the interesting thing is the reaction actually was basically levered at Joe, as if Joe had, quote, spread misinformation.
[00:54:07.717 --> 00:54:08.677]  Joe was the journalist.
[00:54:08.697 --> 00:54:10.257]  I was the doctor expert.
[00:54:10.697 --> 00:54:12.858]  I know because I've published some of these studies.
[00:54:13.458 --> 00:54:18.859]  And so the bottom line is, you know, this is just part of medical scientific interchange.
[00:54:19.439 --> 00:54:21.280]  No one reached out to me at all.
[00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:21.720]  No one.
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:22.560]  Spotify.
[00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:24.600]  No one sent me any messages.
[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:26.821]  No one asked me for the slides or opinions.
[00:54:27.141 --> 00:54:28.241]  None of the fact checkers.
[00:54:28.701 --> 00:54:33.260]   reached out to me. None of the fact-checkers produced any of their slides. And so my point
[00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:38.960]   is, and this escalated all the way to the White House, where Jen Psaki in a press interview
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:41.581]  said that Rogan should be censored.
[00:54:41.603 --> 00:54:47.927]  I reached out through Twitter and I said listen I'd be happy to sit down with the President, the Surgeon General, Jen Psaki.
[00:54:48.207 --> 00:54:49.928]  We'll go over all the data.
[00:54:50.209 --> 00:54:55.732]  There now are a thousand papers on vaccine injuries in the peer-reviewed literature.
[00:54:55.792 --> 00:54:57.153]  A thousand papers Alex.
[00:54:57.554 --> 00:54:58.954]  So I'd be happy to go through them.
[00:54:58.974 --> 00:55:04.038]  It'll take about a day and we can organize it into myocarditis, blood clots.
[00:55:04.058 --> 00:55:10.182]  We can go through all the diseases and they can figure out what published scientific papers they would want to censor or not.
[00:55:10.771 --> 00:55:12.351]  But what you're saying is so key here.
[00:55:12.511 --> 00:55:16.773]  You spent two plus hours with us after Joe, only showing part of the slides.
[00:55:16.833 --> 00:55:18.633]  I mean, it would take days, as you said.
[00:55:18.653 --> 00:55:20.994]  This is college-level medical stuff.
[00:55:21.334 --> 00:55:23.875]  But it's all well known, as you said six months ago on the show.
[00:55:24.275 --> 00:55:28.596]  They now have a term in cardiology for vaccine-caused microcarditis.
[00:55:28.816 --> 00:55:29.716]  This is not debated.
[00:55:29.796 --> 00:55:31.937]  The inserts admit it can cause this.
[00:55:31.997 --> 00:55:33.437]  They admit increases in it.
[00:55:33.777 --> 00:55:35.798]  But then they turn around and say, you're just making it up.
[00:55:36.058 --> 00:55:38.979]  But then they never challenge what you're specifically lying about.
[00:55:39.019 --> 00:55:44.045]   And the key, as you said, Didn't reach out to you to ever get a comment or let you defend yourself.
[00:55:44.306 --> 00:55:45.087]  They just lied.
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.963]  Actually, they never reached out for the slides or the figures.
[00:55:50.003 --> 00:55:52.685]  I mean, they actually never reached out to see the information.
[00:55:53.165 --> 00:56:02.033]  So I'd be happy to, it's an open offer, I'm happy to sit down with any platform if, you know, Spotify being a common carrier, essentially, or any journalist.
[00:56:02.393 --> 00:56:07.817]  I thought Joe Rogan was a very perceptive, intelligent, wonderful journalist.
[00:56:08.518 --> 00:56:10.860]  There was no hyperbole, there was no opinion.
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:18.446]  In fact, one of the fact-checkers raised some issue with a comment about pandemic planning.
[00:56:19.027 --> 00:56:25.912]  And you know, just as I did with you, Alex, I referred to the book by Peter Breggin, COVID-19 and the Global Press, We Are the Prey.
[00:56:26.032 --> 00:56:27.634]  It has all the citations in it.
[00:56:27.954 --> 00:56:29.976]  Actually, I gave you a print copy, Alex.
[00:56:30.336 --> 00:56:35.320]  So, you know, I am just referring to the information that's out there.
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:38.443]  People can seek it themselves and they can review it themselves.
[00:56:40.157 --> 00:56:40.778]  Absolutely.
[00:56:40.818 --> 00:56:43.281]  But again, they can't counter us on facts.
[00:56:43.321 --> 00:56:46.185]  So they just say disinformation, silence them, censor them.
[00:56:46.205 --> 00:56:49.750]  But I think it's safe to say this has backfired on them mightily.
[00:56:50.371 --> 00:56:52.914]  Previously, Elon Musk had the biggest interview with Joe Rogan.
[00:56:53.074 --> 00:56:59.074]   I had the second, third, fourth, and fifth biggest, but now you and Malone's interviews are right up there
[00:56:59.074 --> 00:57:02.474]  in the top five with myself and Elon Musk, which is great.
[00:57:02.474 --> 00:57:06.833]   So his normal show has 10 million, but now it's got 50, 60, 70 million
[00:57:06.833 --> 00:57:11.233]   on the different platforms because they tried that and everywhere the world is waking up
[00:57:11.233 --> 00:57:12.432]  and turning against him.
[00:57:12.432 --> 00:57:14.633]  It's true.
[00:57:14.633 --> 00:57:21.514]   And Neil Young didn't reach out to me, neither did Prince Harry.
[00:57:21.514 --> 00:57:23.313]  None of these celebrities--
[00:57:23.227 --> 00:57:27.091]  I'm the guest, I presented all the data, I've published in this field.
[00:57:27.311 --> 00:57:30.295]  I've had Aaron Rodgers reach out to me, I've had Eric Clapton.
[00:57:30.795 --> 00:57:31.416]  Reach out to me.
[00:57:31.456 --> 00:57:34.758]  I've had Arthur Joseph reach out to me.
[00:57:34.778 --> 00:57:39.781]  So listen, it's not an unusual thing for people to reach out and want to have a discussion.
[00:57:40.121 --> 00:57:46.705]  But the fact that Spotify or the White House Press Secretary, no one actually wanted to have a discussion and review of the data.
[00:57:46.986 --> 00:57:48.847]  They simply wanted to slam Joe Rogan.
[00:57:49.567 --> 00:58:07.220]  I thought that was wrong and unfair and I saw Joe's response and when Joe basically got out there and said listen I brought on these experts he's on a doctor and I think both you and Joe have a terrific journalism style where you're you're simply you know helping the viewers get access to medical experts.
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:08.341]  Exactly.
[00:58:08.401 --> 00:58:16.211]  We have known, I mean, many, many years ago I had Shoemaker and Levy on because I wanted to know about comets and things, you know, hitting gas giants.
[00:58:16.251 --> 00:58:17.112]  And so I didn't do it.
[00:58:17.132 --> 00:58:17.853]  I'm not an astronomer.
[00:58:18.113 --> 00:58:24.161]  And it was a cool interview where I had all the people that discovered it, the amateur astronomers, one was a professional, two were amateur, on.
[00:58:24.181 --> 00:58:24.982]  It was a two-hour interview.
[00:58:25.902 --> 00:58:30.245]  Because I'm not an astronomer, but I had famous astronomers on, and it's the same thing.
[00:58:30.305 --> 00:58:41.791]  We have, and that's why they're so scared of you, is you are one of the top people in your field, and so instead of debate your credentials or the facts, they try to shut down the venue you were on to punish people to not have you on.
[00:58:41.991 --> 00:58:45.353]  But let me guess, that's not probably silence to you.
[00:58:45.993 --> 00:58:49.595]  I would imagine after Joe, you got a lot more media requests, even though you were already flooded.
[00:58:51.454 --> 00:58:56.375]  You know, I had made one statement on Joe Rogan that evolved with the science.
[00:58:56.415 --> 00:58:59.877]  You know, on December 8th, I said you can't get COVID-19 a second time.
[00:59:00.597 --> 00:59:04.898]  And on December 10th, the news broke that, in fact, Omicron broke through natural immunity.
[00:59:05.338 --> 00:59:10.220]  So when I went on your show and others, I let the audience know.
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.300]  I was on Laura Ingraham and Fox News.
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.521]  I said, listen, you know, the virus is mutated.
[00:59:14.881 --> 00:59:15.701]  Things change.
[00:59:16.381 --> 00:59:17.762]  But everything is factual.
[00:59:17.782 --> 00:59:23.678]   I think Let's just start discussing the data.
[00:59:23.758 --> 00:59:27.423]  More and more information comes out on my Twitter feed.
[00:59:27.503 --> 00:59:29.786]  I have five papers today.
[00:59:29.806 --> 00:59:31.688]  It's very factual.
[00:59:31.748 --> 00:59:33.791]  These come out in the British Medical Journal.
[00:59:34.451 --> 00:59:36.874]  One is by the CDC, the MMWR.
[00:59:38.156 --> 00:59:46.202]  Well, Doc, stay there.
[00:59:46.222 --> 00:59:59.071]  It sounds like you want to go to that first because, wow, Japanese come out with a huge study on ivermectin, a couple other big studies, now even Reuters admits, okay, ivermectin is antiviral, and these other papers vindicating everything you have said.
[00:59:59.271 --> 01:00:05.036]  We'll be right back with Dr. Peter McCullough and we'll give you all his websites and more, but the best place is his Twitter.
[01:00:05.516 --> 01:00:06.477]  We'll be right back.
[01:00:06.817 --> 01:00:10.039]  Best place to find us is futurenews.news.
[01:00:10.339 --> 01:00:12.020]  That's the current URL they haven't banned.
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:13.181]  Futurenews.news.
[01:00:14.682 --> 01:00:21.306]  So the hallmark of my broadcast are that when I talk about something, I neurotically show it to you.
[01:00:21.986 --> 01:00:24.128]  It doesn't mean that piece of information is always totally accurate.
[01:00:24.148 --> 01:00:25.769]  It doesn't mean things don't change.
[01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:32.438]   Like Dr. McCullough said, normally, Viruses don't evolutionarily just jump like Omicron did.
[01:00:32.458 --> 01:00:44.311]  And that's why a lot of top scientists said, this looks like it was lab manipulated to actually end this pandemic and some white hats made it to counter the lab-made virus that we know from my research Fauci made.
[01:00:44.351 --> 01:00:45.752]  But Dr. McCullough doesn't go there.
[01:00:45.772 --> 01:00:46.734]  He doesn't like to speculate.
[01:00:47.334 --> 01:00:51.638]   The point is, is that 99% of the time, you don't see stuff like that happen.
[01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:57.362]  But when suddenly, okay, Omicron has now, you know, done this and people that were immune can get sick from it.
[01:00:57.502 --> 01:01:01.804]  I know because I've had both Delta and Omicron, that that's absolutely true.
[01:01:02.565 --> 01:01:04.867]  But when he wasn't wrong, things just changed.
[01:01:04.987 --> 01:01:06.608]  In general, that's normally how it is.
[01:01:06.668 --> 01:01:09.209]  But this is a weird, wacky world we're in right now.
[01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:13.612]  So doctor, let's go through I think the best place to start is the latest information.
[01:01:13.993 --> 01:01:16.054]  And people can follow along with that on your Twitter.
[01:01:17.263 --> 01:01:24.470]  So Dr. Peter McCullough, people should go to at P underscore MC McCullough MD or just go to Twitter and search Dr. Peter McCullough.
[01:01:25.291 --> 01:01:29.635]  We'll also link to his Twitter under the live show feed right now so folks can find that easier.
[01:01:29.896 --> 01:01:30.997]  Let's start getting into these studies.
[01:01:32.558 --> 01:01:37.942]  Okay, well the first one is let's pick up on Haase et al from the CDC, MMWR.
[01:01:38.463 --> 01:01:47.630]  They published six weeks of safety data of children ages 5 to 11 getting the vaccines and the data were not good at all.
[01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:54.916]  They ended up with 100 serious safety reports, 15% of which had an elevation intraponin.
[01:01:54.956 --> 01:01:59.076]   That means there's heart injury occurring in children below age 12.
[01:01:59.076 --> 01:02:01.516]  We previously didn't think this was possible.
[01:02:01.516 --> 01:02:07.635]   When we looked at myocarditis before COVID-19 vaccination, you almost never saw it before puberty.
[01:02:07.635 --> 01:02:09.795]  Almost, just basically just didn't happen.
[01:02:09.795 --> 01:02:14.195]   A paper by Aurelia and colleagues from Finland demonstrated that, you know,
[01:02:14.195 --> 01:02:19.516]   the explosion in myocarditis is very rare, but if it happens, it happens after puberty.
[01:02:19.516 --> 01:02:24.315]   Here with the COVID-19 vaccines, it looked like it's gonna happen in younger children.
[01:02:24.315 --> 01:02:30.995]   And then in the HACI paper, the self-reported data came in from V-safe, Alex,
[01:02:30.995 --> 01:02:40.516]   and reported their systemic reactions were reported in 34% of the children on shot one,
[01:02:40.516 --> 01:02:46.355]   40% on shot two, and then a negative health impact on the children,
[01:02:46.355 --> 01:02:51.355]  10% of those at shot one and 15% in shot two.
[01:02:52.276 --> 01:02:56.155]  And that's by HACI in MMWR.
[01:02:56.155 --> 01:02:57.995]  That was just out recently.
[01:02:58.325 --> 01:02:59.265]  This does not look good.
[01:02:59.305 --> 01:03:17.109]  This is CDC data, and I can tell you, since children at this age have a negligible symptomatic presentation for COVID-19, and it's likely the majority are now COVID-recovered, to actually sustain this type of damage and injury is simply unacceptable.
[01:03:17.749 --> 01:03:20.272]  And sir, they're trying to spin it, I've noticed, to interrupt.
[01:03:20.292 --> 01:03:25.438]  They're trying to spin it now that, oh, inflation's causing heart attacks, including in eight-year-olds.
[01:03:25.738 --> 01:03:28.762]  I have articles saying, well, now little kids have heart attacks.
[01:03:28.782 --> 01:03:29.643]  It's just the new normal.
[01:03:29.923 --> 01:03:30.964]  It's the stress.
[01:03:31.825 --> 01:03:32.946]  No, doctor, what's really happening?
[01:03:32.966 --> 01:03:38.312]  Because first they said, oh, COVID-19's causing the myocarditis, but then now it's happening in people that have already been recovered.
[01:03:38.332 --> 01:03:38.973]  What's really happening?
[01:03:39.784 --> 01:03:43.607]  No, Joe Rogan and I, you know, have had a conversation offline on this too.
[01:03:44.207 --> 01:03:48.350]  The COVID-19, the respiratory infection, does not cause myocarditis.
[01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:53.454]  That's been ruled out by a paper by Joy and colleagues from Washington University in St.
[01:03:53.474 --> 01:03:53.714]  Louis.
[01:03:53.934 --> 01:04:01.139]  What happens in sick adults, they can have an isolated elevated troponin because they're sick in the ICU, just like someone with pneumococcal sepsis.
[01:04:01.159 --> 01:04:08.063]   But the clinical definition of myocarditis, chest pain, EKG changes, heart failure, Sky Hydroponin.
[01:04:08.103 --> 01:04:13.265]  That is basically what we see with the vaccines, not with the respiratory illness.
[01:04:13.365 --> 01:04:17.866]  I want to move to, you made a comment regarding mutations of Omicron.
[01:04:18.246 --> 01:04:32.094]   Paper out by medical reporter in British Medical Journal, Mahasi, it's on my Twitter feed, Mahasi, Remember, the BA1 signifies the Omicron variant, and then the BA2 is the sub-variant.
[01:04:32.394 --> 01:04:43.961]  It turns out, you're right Alex, that the BA2 looks like it's actually a back mutation, where there's been some code restored for the spike protein in the BA2.
[01:04:44.001 --> 01:04:47.506]   That's picking up in In Europe.
[01:04:47.526 --> 01:04:50.528]  But the point is, in the Mahasi paper, look at this.
[01:04:50.848 --> 01:05:00.593]  At 25 weeks, the vaccines only had 9% vaccine efficacy for the original Omicron and only 13% for the BA2.
[01:05:01.133 --> 01:05:09.958]  And the boosted, the freshly boosted calculated vaccine efficacy was 63% for BA1 and 70% for BA2.
[01:05:10.418 --> 01:05:16.361]  I can tell you that the non-randomized estimates of vaccine efficacy are gross overestimates.
[01:05:16.801 --> 01:05:19.003]  And these are low gross overestimates.
[01:05:19.043 --> 01:05:27.668]  What I'm telling you is, with no randomized data at this point in time, it would be my inference that the vaccines are fundamentally useless against Omicron.
[01:05:29.129 --> 01:05:31.111]  Which they tried to deny just a few months ago.
[01:05:31.151 --> 01:05:42.038]  They said, get your shot, all these world leaders, and it'll protect you, just like Biden kept saying, oh, get the shot, you're totally protected, six months, a year after they were admitting that it had waning effectiveness.
[01:05:43.092 --> 01:05:56.557]  Well, you see this in the report again on my Twitter feed by Ioko Biusi, also in British Medical Journal, where the National Health System alleges completely dropped vaccines for the health care workers in the UK.
[01:05:57.537 --> 01:06:01.378]   So I can tell you it's just not a compelling Proposition.
[01:06:01.898 --> 01:06:05.979]  The next big update actually came from JAMA in the United States.
[01:06:06.019 --> 01:06:07.119]  This just hit the wires.
[01:06:08.019 --> 01:06:08.820]  Very good study.
[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:10.580]  High quality antibody study.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.600]  Listen to this.
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:12.880]  It's by Alejo.
[01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:14.181]  A-L-E-J-O.
[01:06:14.861 --> 01:06:26.563]  Alex, in those who have COVID recovered like you and I, 99% have positive antibodies and it's not limited by time with these better antibody tests.
[01:06:27.423 --> 01:06:32.525]  Of those who had suspected COVID but never got a test, 55% had antibodies.
[01:06:32.925 --> 01:06:36.666]  And completely asymptomatic, 11% had antibodies.
[01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:51.031]  And now we saw something hit the newswire that Starbucks and GE and other companies are hiring back unvaccinated workers, since unvaccinated workers look so good in terms of their immunity for those who are COVID recovered.
[01:06:51.451 --> 01:06:54.632]  And let me just interrupt before you keep going and go back, because I saw this.
[01:06:54.652 --> 01:06:56.273]  It's one of the reasons I was begging you to come on last week.
[01:06:56.853 --> 01:07:03.156]  This is huge to have the British medical system, the UK, say, OK, we're not going to make our workers take it anymore.
[01:07:03.617 --> 01:07:12.121]  And then they start sourcing and people have interviewed them and they're told, hey, we're told this vaccine is getting pulled soon or the whole program is going to be pulled.
[01:07:12.421 --> 01:07:13.221]  We've seen that.
[01:07:13.261 --> 01:07:14.922]  We've heard that from sources in the UK.
[01:07:15.162 --> 01:07:16.103]  Have you heard any rumblings?
[01:07:18.869 --> 01:07:19.810]  No, I haven't.
[01:07:20.010 --> 01:07:27.433]  I've been calling for the vaccine mandates to be dropped and the vaccines to be pulled from the market for quite some time, and I hope it's soon.
[01:07:28.634 --> 01:07:41.721]  When I was at a packed auditorium in Fox River Lutheran Church in Illinois last weekend, Alex, when I mentioned the idea of the vaccines being pulled off the market, there was a standing room ovation.
[01:07:41.741 --> 01:07:45.643]   People thought I thought it would be a national holiday the day the vaccines go away.
[01:07:45.943 --> 01:07:54.549]  I want to point you to another paper in JAMA out by Akashi and colleagues and this is the results of all the asymptomatic testing done at the Olympics.
[01:07:55.049 --> 01:08:00.212]  Now I was on Newsmax with Rob Mitchell before the Olympics and I forecasted this.
[01:08:00.653 --> 01:08:14.537]   They ended up doing thousands of tests Alex and What they found is that the rate of picking up any positive test at the Olympics was 0.44% and it was clinically useless.
[01:08:15.198 --> 01:08:22.919]  So I've said for the longest time we should follow the regulatory science here and patients with no symptoms should never be tested.
[01:08:22.939 --> 01:08:29.521]  The tests are only approved or clinically cleared to use as a diagnostic aid in acutely sick individuals.
[01:08:31.047 --> 01:08:32.188]  Wow, we're going to go to break.
[01:08:33.329 --> 01:08:34.289]  You've got so much to cover.
[01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:35.090]  What are we going to hit next?
[01:08:36.571 --> 01:08:40.574]  I want to hit some highlights from the Senate testimony on January 24th.
[01:08:40.674 --> 01:08:41.995]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:42.295]  Wow.
[01:08:42.355 --> 01:08:43.176]  Yeah, that was important.
[01:08:43.496 --> 01:08:45.457]  We've got so much here with Dr. Peter McCullough.
[01:08:45.817 --> 01:08:49.000]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:55.204]  Tomorrow's news today and later when this live show is over, we're going to put like an hour of amazing clips he sent us on the end of it for you to share.
[01:08:56.252 --> 01:09:05.598]  Well, they definitely got a tiger by the tail with the medical community of doctors and scientists and nurses and lab technicians that are seeing all this cancer explode.
[01:09:06.499 --> 01:09:14.263]  You've got the epidemiologists going public, you've got the pathologists of the world going public, from Germany to Japan to the United States to Canada.
[01:09:14.764 --> 01:09:15.344]  Who's who?
[01:09:15.823 --> 01:09:20.823]   I mean, I'm actually proud of the scientific community at the real level.
[01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:25.623]   But then you've got the big pharma corporations and big tech and the big media together trying
[01:09:25.623 --> 01:09:28.582]  to force these products down people's throats.
[01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:30.943]  And man, is it blowing up in their face.
[01:09:30.943 --> 01:09:36.263]   You've got Bill Gates' wife now publicly separating herself not just from Jeffrey Epstein and
[01:09:36.263 --> 01:09:38.342]  her husband, but from his agenda.
[01:09:38.342 --> 01:09:42.583]  I mean, these are rats leaving the sinking ship.
[01:09:42.583 --> 01:09:45.022]  Maybe she's a good person and didn't know how bad he was.
[01:09:45.022 --> 01:09:47.942]   So Dr. McCullough, I want to talk about the 35,000 foot view.
[01:09:47.942 --> 01:09:50.942]   You don't have the floor to drill into all the science and facts like you like.
[01:09:50.942 --> 01:09:57.582]   But as a patriot, as an American, as a doctor, as a citizen, as a free soul.
[01:09:57.582 --> 01:10:07.582]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:09:58.712 --> 01:09:59.894]  How do you see this fight going?
[01:09:59.914 --> 01:10:02.559]  It looks like they've got a tiger by the tail and they're getting torn up by it.
[01:10:02.919 --> 01:10:05.043]  And then I get a little concerned, what are they going to do to counter that?
[01:10:05.063 --> 01:10:10.593]  I mean, you've got former BlackRock fund managers, high level, coming out saying, we've crunched the numbers.
[01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:13.920]  What VAERS, what the Pentagon numbers show, it's even worse.
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:16.261]  There's mass death and illness everywhere this is happening.
[01:10:16.481 --> 01:10:17.182]  You can't hide it.
[01:10:17.242 --> 01:10:17.902]  It's historic.
[01:10:18.382 --> 01:10:20.963]  Everybody anecdotally sees it, plus we see it in the numbers.
[01:10:21.544 --> 01:10:26.246]  What would you call this moment in history, and how do you think the system extricates itself?
[01:10:26.286 --> 01:10:32.569]  Because this is going to make other bad drugs that were put on the market historically that caused disasters look tame in comparison.
[01:10:32.629 --> 01:10:36.791]  Is this the biggest medical malpractice, big pharma disaster in human history?
[01:10:38.283 --> 01:10:47.406]  You know, what I see is the first wave was the respiratory illness, which caused great fear and and the medical community and the public responding to it.
[01:10:47.766 --> 01:10:55.929]  But the vaccine rollout, the worldwide indiscriminate vaccine rollout, has really galvanized the world on freedom.
[01:10:55.969 --> 01:10:59.990]  Now, it's not freedom like one country and its borders with another country.
[01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:01.811]  It's medical freedom.
[01:11:01.971 --> 01:11:06.555]  It's the personal freedom to decide what goes into one's own body.
[01:11:06.875 --> 01:11:19.344]  And we saw that on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, the Defeat the Mandates American Homecoming march, and then about 35,000 marched from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial.
[01:11:19.964 --> 01:11:25.569]  And TJ Sears, who's Austin's own comedian, was the moderator.
[01:11:25.709 --> 01:11:28.491]  I gave the lead-off medical presentation.
[01:11:29.171 --> 01:11:43.090]   And we had doctors, scientists, nurses, lawyers, public health officials, really a spirited presentation by Austin's Del Bigtree of the That was fantastic.
[01:11:43.210 --> 01:11:46.851]  And I tell you, everyone was listening to every word of Bobby Kennedy.
[01:11:47.051 --> 01:11:50.092]  That was the backdrop for January 23rd.
[01:11:50.573 --> 01:11:53.674]  And then we moved right into the historic U.S.
[01:11:53.754 --> 01:11:58.096]  Senate panel led by Republican Ron Johnson from Wisconsin.
[01:11:58.796 --> 01:12:00.336]  I co-moderated the panel.
[01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:05.198]  And the title of the panel was, A Second Opinion on COVID-19.
[01:12:05.238 --> 01:12:06.939]  And boy, it couldn't have any better title.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:13.584]   So putting on your citizen cap, Where do you see this going?
[01:12:13.664 --> 01:12:19.431]  I mean, you even have the head of the UN vaccine program, as you know, it got almost no attention two weeks ago saying, don't give this to children.
[01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:21.613]  You have the EU a month ago saying, don't give it to children.
[01:12:21.633 --> 01:12:25.518]  You have all these different federal regulators having to resign because they said, don't give it to children.
[01:12:25.958 --> 01:12:31.905]  And then here's Biden and Psaki and all their little paid for minions on YouTube and Instagram saying, you better do it.
[01:12:32.285 --> 01:12:34.088]  You know, the children will die if you don't.
[01:12:34.369 --> 01:12:37.213]  I mean, do these people realize the crime they've signed on to?
[01:12:37.393 --> 01:12:40.078]  Because you could argue they did it by accident, they didn't know before.
[01:12:40.098 --> 01:12:42.221]  I think all that was premeditated, the evidence is there.
[01:12:42.522 --> 01:12:46.248]  But now they know, and so now they are committing the crime.
[01:12:47.532 --> 01:12:48.652]  The wall is crumbling.
[01:12:48.692 --> 01:12:51.453]  It seems like bricks are falling on either side of the wall.
[01:12:51.713 --> 01:12:58.315]  You know, when we were in D.C., we couldn't even get a cup of coffee without showing a vaccine card in D.C.
[01:12:58.335 --> 01:13:04.657]  But we go a few miles into the state of Virginia, it was easy to, you know, no masks, no vaccines required.
[01:13:05.297 --> 01:13:07.998]  Scotland, Ireland and England, the U.K.
[01:13:08.018 --> 01:13:10.859]  just dropped all mandates, including vaccine mandates.
[01:13:11.479 --> 01:13:12.899]  That's happening in a few places.
[01:13:12.979 --> 01:13:13.800]  So does Sweden.
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:14.460]  So does Sweden.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.300]  It's like dominoes.
[01:13:16.314 --> 01:13:17.895]  It's like dominoes in the United States.
[01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:21.216]  The city of Denver just dropped all its mandates.
[01:13:21.756 --> 01:13:23.596]  Starbucks dropped its mandates.
[01:13:24.096 --> 01:13:25.037]  GE and others.
[01:13:25.317 --> 01:13:27.738]  So you're going to see this fracturing here.
[01:13:28.018 --> 01:13:29.258]  But what happened in the U.S.
[01:13:29.278 --> 01:13:32.139]  Senate panel was five hours of truth bombs.
[01:13:32.619 --> 01:13:38.201]  And it was dozens and dozens of doctors and scientists, nurses, patients.
[01:13:38.781 --> 01:13:41.305]  And by the way, let me interrupt.
[01:13:41.745 --> 01:13:43.467]  We put up five or six versions of this.
[01:13:43.567 --> 01:13:45.350]  One's five hours long, one's three hours long.
[01:13:45.370 --> 01:13:46.531]  There's a bunch of short clips.
[01:13:47.072 --> 01:13:49.395]  But everybody needs to see the whole presentation.
[01:13:49.715 --> 01:13:51.357]  Wherever you find it, folks, you need to get it.
[01:13:51.938 --> 01:13:56.544]  What's the best term to search, doctor, to find the full Senate Committee meeting?
[01:13:57.692 --> 01:14:01.154]  I think just search US Senate Panel Second Opinion, Ron Johnson.
[01:14:01.214 --> 01:14:04.675]  One of the best, Alex, is a 38-minute highlight reel.
[01:14:04.715 --> 01:14:07.336]  I'll shoot that over to your producers to get that up.
[01:14:07.396 --> 01:14:08.197]  It's up on YouTube.
[01:14:08.797 --> 01:14:19.242]  And I have to tell you, what I learned from this is that there are far more doctors who understand COVID-19 as a treatable illness than I ever thought.
[01:14:20.022 --> 01:14:25.628]  We heard from the father of critical care, the person who's published more on critical care than anybody in the world, Paul Merrick.
[01:14:26.108 --> 01:14:32.334]  He said flat out, based on his analysis, and he cited the data, Remdesivir is killing Americans.
[01:14:34.416 --> 01:14:35.017]  And that's right.
[01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:42.684]  And just to be clear, we have that 38-minute clip, so when this show's over today and we archive it to go viral, folks, I know it'll get a million views, it needs 10 million listeners.
[01:14:43.934 --> 01:14:47.316]  We've got some videos at 5, 6, 7 million, but none have ever hit 10 million at Banned.video.
[01:14:47.636 --> 01:14:48.837]  I want to reach more people.
[01:14:49.177 --> 01:14:50.437]  This is a life and death situation.
[01:14:50.457 --> 01:14:53.199]  You mentioned Rendezvir.
[01:14:54.221 --> 01:14:56.323]  We will add the video you just talked about to the end of the report.
[01:14:56.703 --> 01:15:12.756]  But I have articles out of the Epoch Times, very credible with all the links to it, all over the U.S., not just in Canada or Europe, they are taking people away from their families, they are intubating them, just like they did the last two years, and they are forcing them on Rendezvir and killing them.
[01:15:12.796 --> 01:15:18.440]  So this is being called, by the Epoch Times, not by me, that's radical for them, medical kidnapping.
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:19.101]  What's going on here?
[01:15:20.274 --> 01:15:20.674]  It's true.
[01:15:20.715 --> 01:15:30.883]  We heard from Dr. Aaron Carity, former professor at UC Irvine, a professor of psychiatry, human ethics expert, present and testify to that fact.
[01:15:30.903 --> 01:15:32.325]  This is all in the Senate record now.
[01:15:32.665 --> 01:15:36.028]  I think it's the authoritative nature of the presenters.
[01:15:36.207 --> 01:15:41.807]   When Paul Merrick, who's published more on critical care, he's taking care of acutely sick COVID patients
[01:15:41.807 --> 01:15:43.567]  in the hospital, hundreds of them.
[01:15:43.567 --> 01:15:49.287]   When he said his analysis from Deserveer is killing people, when Aaron Carity, who's in ethics,
[01:15:49.287 --> 01:15:53.546]   he does hospital ethics consults, and he said basically patients are imprisoned
[01:15:53.546 --> 01:15:54.487]  against their will.
[01:15:54.487 --> 01:15:55.766]  I mean, these were truth bombs.
[01:15:55.766 --> 01:16:02.926]   I asked Christina Parks, a respected scientist, a PhD scientist from Michigan, who's African-American,
[01:16:02.926 --> 01:16:06.807]   I asked her, are African-Americans being denied treatment, Alex?
[01:16:06.773 --> 01:16:07.494]  You know what she said?
[01:16:07.914 --> 01:16:15.525]  She said, yes, Dr. McCullough, my dad just died three days ago of COVID and he was denied monoclonal antibodies and early treatment.
[01:16:16.867 --> 01:16:17.287]  Absolutely.
[01:16:17.308 --> 01:16:18.469]  I remember asking you months ago.
[01:16:19.562 --> 01:16:21.805]  Are they suppressing monoclonal antibodies?
[01:16:21.846 --> 01:16:22.987]  You said it looks like it.
[01:16:23.408 --> 01:16:25.451]  And then I talked to people that actually run clinics in Texas.
[01:16:25.471 --> 01:16:28.195]  They said, yeah, but we don't want to, you know, buck the system right now.
[01:16:28.215 --> 01:16:29.337]  Now they've since gone public.
[01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:33.783]  And then last week, Biden comes out and just says they don't work.
[01:16:34.725 --> 01:16:35.265]  Is that true?
[01:16:36.744 --> 01:16:54.549]  There's a paper by Pulliam and colleagues from South Africa, it's a modeling study, not a clinical study, suggesting that the Lilly product and the Regeneron product may not hit the Omicron BA1 variant, and we don't know about the BA2 sub-variant, but clearly Soterivumab, the GSK product, does.
[01:16:55.189 --> 01:17:02.897]  And it's designed to actually cover mutant strains since it targets a glycoprotein part of the spike protein that's not amenable to mutation.
[01:17:03.217 --> 01:17:06.180]  So that GSK product's been EUA approved from May.
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:08.762]  And so I was on Sean Hannity radio.
[01:17:09.063 --> 01:17:11.525]  I said, Sean, we're at the Battle of the Bulge with Omicron.
[01:17:11.545 --> 01:17:14.047]  We've got some sick seniors who will get symptomatic.
[01:17:14.068 --> 01:17:14.748]  We need to use it.
[01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:16.770]  Where's the GSK product?
[01:17:17.231 --> 01:17:19.653]  Our administration has completely fallen flat.
[01:17:19.813 --> 01:17:24.373]   supply lines and here we are when we really need it we've got a high quality
[01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:28.813]   product the federal government has no accountability or transparency on where
[01:17:28.813 --> 01:17:33.292]   it is. Well it seems like a Fauci doesn't own a stake in it it doesn't get
[01:17:33.292 --> 01:17:39.011]   promoted. You know just that the therapeutics overall have not been
[01:17:39.482 --> 01:17:45.167]  Twitter feed today, Senator Rand Paul says we have to be focused on therapeutics.
[01:17:45.187 --> 01:17:47.369]  That's what Ron Johnson has said all along.
[01:17:47.589 --> 01:17:59.560]  Do you know that Ron Johnson invited dozens and dozens of public health officials and others to attend the second opinion and learn from expert doctors who are publishing and those who are treating COVID-19 patients?
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:00.841]  No one showed up.
[01:18:01.401 --> 01:18:02.422]  That is so powerful.
[01:18:02.442 --> 01:18:03.663]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[01:18:03.964 --> 01:18:11.451]  And, something else Senator Paul said, he's going to call for a criminal investigation and have hearings on Fauci.
[01:18:11.491 --> 01:18:15.114]  So, that's all happening if the Republicans win back control of the Senate.
[01:18:15.454 --> 01:18:20.939]  And with this Senator, the Democratic Senator, almost dead from the shot it looks like, maybe sooner than we thought.
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:23.642]  Well, Big Pharma tried to take over.
[01:18:24.884 --> 01:18:27.405]  And it looked like they were winning at first, but right now it's blowing with their face.
[01:18:27.425 --> 01:18:28.826]  Dr. Peter McCullough is our guest.
[01:18:29.346 --> 01:18:32.327]  There's so many places to go, so many studies, so much new breaking news.
[01:18:33.428 --> 01:18:39.551]  And I know you're not a vindictive person, but Fauci and the gain of function and the things he said, the things he's done.
[01:18:39.571 --> 01:18:43.272]  Senator Paul that you mentioned is now saying he's really going to go after him.
[01:18:44.713 --> 01:18:53.057]  I don't even want to go after these people, except it seems like if we don't discredit them and go after them, they're going to keep coming after us with lockdowns that John Hopkins has discredited.
[01:18:54.321 --> 01:18:58.202]  More, quote, boosters that don't even work and vaccine passports.
[01:18:58.222 --> 01:19:00.602]  So it just seems like we've got to really go after the system.
[01:19:00.622 --> 01:19:01.522]  What's your view on that?
[01:19:01.562 --> 01:19:05.703]  And how do we punish those in power that have done this so they don't do it again?
[01:19:06.963 --> 01:19:09.204]  Well, tensions are clearly mounting.
[01:19:09.984 --> 01:19:11.224]  You know, at our U.S.
[01:19:11.264 --> 01:19:28.868]   Senate panel by video, Professor Jay Bhattacharya from Stanford, who's one of the authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, He's been directly attacked by our Director of the National Allergy and Immunology Branch at the NIH.
[01:19:28.888 --> 01:19:33.270]  And remember, Alex, that a division head at the NIH is not a very high position.
[01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:36.611]  And the NIH is a government research organization.
[01:19:36.651 --> 01:19:37.531]  They work for us.
[01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:38.852]  I'm an academic doctor.
[01:19:38.872 --> 01:19:43.834]  The NIH basically is subservient to a clinical investigator, which would be my status.
[01:19:44.234 --> 01:19:46.534]  The CDC is an outbreak investigation unit.
[01:19:46.555 --> 01:19:47.635]  They also work for us.
[01:19:48.155 --> 01:19:53.482]  And then the FDA is a drug safety watchdog organization, and they do the advertising labels for the new drugs.
[01:19:53.842 --> 01:19:57.867]  Remember, these agencies do not sit above doctors and the public.
[01:19:57.887 --> 01:19:58.869]  They're actually below us.
[01:19:58.929 --> 01:19:59.810]  They work for us.
[01:19:59.890 --> 01:20:00.671]  They serve us.
[01:20:00.691 --> 01:20:02.894]  That's the kind of employment relationship.
[01:20:03.354 --> 01:20:18.627]  So, we have a situation where the doctors, the treating doctors, are the ones who have superiority in any type of decision, any type of clinical care, and really, honestly, have superiority in the decisions on how to interpret the data.
[01:20:19.268 --> 01:20:21.449]  And so, Jay Bhartachar has been very fair.
[01:20:21.489 --> 01:20:29.356]  He's a frequent contributor on Fox News, along with myself, and Scott Atlas, and Kirk Millhone, and Ray Eskewey, and others.
[01:20:29.396 --> 01:20:35.917]   And we've been very fair as we review review the data and we go on many news channels, OAN, Newsmax,
[01:20:35.917 --> 01:20:37.417]  etc.
[01:20:37.417 --> 01:20:42.478]   What we have not seen is we have not seen fair balance with respect to our public health
[01:20:42.478 --> 01:20:46.738]   officials or even our executive branch people when their statements
[01:20:46.737 --> 01:20:54.001]  So for instance, anytime the vaccine is presented, it must be according to law, it must be presented with risks and benefits.
[01:20:54.662 --> 01:21:05.709]  That there's the truth in advertising, the US Food and Drug Cosmetic Act, and the Landman Act, that all say any biopharmaceutical product, EUA or not, must be presented in fair balance.
[01:21:05.909 --> 01:21:07.250]  And there's, you know, there's no fair balance.
[01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:10.992]  President Biden has basically barked a command saying get vaccinated.
[01:21:13.829 --> 01:21:15.991]  Doctor, I think you hit something really central here.
[01:21:17.051 --> 01:21:23.896]  We have corporations trying to take over the office of doctors and of healers.
[01:21:24.717 --> 01:21:31.982]  And that's what this really is, is a corporate media big tech war trying to say that they are who you can go to.
[01:21:32.442 --> 01:21:34.164]  And when they tell you something, you've got to live by it.
[01:21:34.404 --> 01:21:40.498]   Forget a second opinion as they try to gag the real Medical people.
[01:21:40.958 --> 01:21:44.220]  I mean, it just seems extremely evil, and that's what this fight is all about.
[01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:48.441]  It's true, and you know, doctors have to show some backbone.
[01:21:49.042 --> 01:21:52.643]  And I can tell you, the doctors in this group had no problem doing that.
[01:21:52.703 --> 01:21:57.145]  Pierre Corey, the fearless leader of the Frontline Critical Care Consortium.
[01:21:57.465 --> 01:22:03.627]  Ryan Cole, who really brought up the issue about the vaccines and the emerging data on cancer.
[01:22:03.567 --> 01:22:14.686]   Richard Urso, around the table, David Wiseman, former J&J scientist, vaccine scientist.
[01:22:14.826 --> 01:22:20.148]  Robert Malone, independent consultant and patent holder on messenger RNA vaccines.
[01:22:20.929 --> 01:22:22.409]  This was an all-star cast.
[01:22:22.449 --> 01:22:26.511]  Paul Alexander, former White House advisor, WHO advisor.
[01:22:26.851 --> 01:22:30.573]  Christina Parks, I've mentioned, it just kept going on and on.
[01:22:30.593 --> 01:22:34.314]  Jennifer Bridges, who's the lead nurse in the Houston Methodist case.
[01:22:34.374 --> 01:22:41.882]   And Jennifer Bridges told a man Absolutely extraordinary.
[01:22:41.902 --> 01:22:43.784]  Again, I could guide the discussion, but you're the expert here.
[01:22:43.884 --> 01:22:47.243]   and how she lost her job because she couldn't take the vaccine.
[01:22:47.243 --> 01:22:48.844]  She couldn't medically take the vaccine.
[01:22:48.844 --> 01:22:50.923]  I mean, this was stunning testimony.
[01:22:50.923 --> 01:22:51.682]  It was five hours.
[01:22:51.682 --> 01:22:53.043]  There's no break.
[01:22:53.043 --> 01:22:55.003]  And it was it was extraordinary.
[01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:57.923]  Absolutely extraordinary.
[01:22:57.923 --> 01:23:00.722]   Again, I could guide the discussion, but you're the expert here.
[01:23:00.722 --> 01:23:04.363]   What else do you want to get to the viewers mind out there so they're aware
[01:23:04.363 --> 01:23:04.963]  of what's happening?
[01:23:04.963 --> 01:23:12.082]   Well, the very important updates now are that it's becoming fundamentally clear
[01:23:12.484 --> 01:23:15.043]  that there's little or no interest in our seniors.
[01:23:15.079 --> 01:23:21.743]  You never hear our public health agencies talk about our seniors, but our seniors still are where the action are.
[01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:26.826]  There still are going to be some seniors who get hospitalized or worse with Omicron.
[01:23:26.846 --> 01:23:27.746]  There's no mention of them.
[01:23:28.467 --> 01:23:30.788]  There's an incredible focus on children.
[01:23:30.828 --> 01:23:35.371]  We've now heard about trying to vaccinate children below age five.
[01:23:35.971 --> 01:23:38.254]  Remember, children, there's been no school outbreaks.
[01:23:38.294 --> 01:23:39.516]  The kids are back at school.
[01:23:40.537 --> 01:23:44.061]  There's no credible student-to-teacher spread with serious illness.
[01:23:44.742 --> 01:23:47.886]  We know the transmission is within the household, usually adult-to-child.
[01:23:47.926 --> 01:23:53.013]  When it happens, a majority of children probably are actually already immune.
[01:23:53.653 --> 01:24:04.461]  That the focus now on children under age 5 and here it would be Pfizer giving 5 micrograms of messenger RNA and the trials actually failed to raise immunity.
[01:24:04.501 --> 01:24:08.524]  The children's bodies were pretty adept at fighting off the messenger RNA.
[01:24:08.565 --> 01:24:12.788]  Now there's some recalculation of trying to push forward even though they're not efficacious.
[01:24:13.348 --> 01:24:16.269]  You know, these are things that parents need to understand.
[01:24:16.289 --> 01:24:22.733]  When I gave my presentation on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, I said, really, the decision is in everyone's hands.
[01:24:22.793 --> 01:24:27.715]  If everyone tomorrow worldwide said no, this entire program crumbles.
[01:24:28.035 --> 01:24:38.866]   And you know, while we were having a rally in Washington, there were dozens and dozens of rallies and marches occurring over the Leading up to this all over the world.
[01:24:39.147 --> 01:24:44.208]  And then shortly afterwards was this massive Canadian convoy that converged on Ottawa.
[01:24:44.248 --> 01:24:45.149]  It's really made the news.
[01:24:45.469 --> 01:24:47.749]  Heroes like Paul Alexander were there.
[01:24:48.009 --> 01:24:49.030]  Roger Hodkinson.
[01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:50.270]  Dr. Pines.
[01:24:50.730 --> 01:24:53.671]  These were absolutely terrific Canadian heroes.
[01:24:53.971 --> 01:24:56.972]  Many Americans can't get across the border because they haven't taken the vaccine.
[01:24:57.012 --> 01:25:00.394]  But I tell you, our Canadians have really made us proud.
[01:25:00.794 --> 01:25:01.714]  They're basically shocked.
[01:25:03.157 --> 01:25:09.978]  Dr. Peter McCullough, you're absolutely right, and a point you raised, because you're the doctor, but I've looked at the studies, that's what I gleaned from them, but you can correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:25:10.599 --> 01:25:27.342]  The children are so powerful, they're fighting off the attempt by the GMO injection to take over their cells, so it's not working, and they even admit in the headlines, doesn't work, but still let's do it, just to have that pretext to own children's bodies, I guess.
[01:25:29.191 --> 01:25:30.272]  It's going to cause harm.
[01:25:30.493 --> 01:25:31.594]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:25:31.634 --> 01:25:33.876]  If there's no benefit, then there's only harm.
[01:25:34.497 --> 01:25:37.500]  The data do not look good on safety across the board.
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:44.608]  You know, I've said from the very beginning, young people should not take the vaccine because more harm than good.
[01:25:47.851 --> 01:25:49.693]  We're going to cover a lot of news in the next 30 minutes.
[01:25:49.713 --> 01:25:50.454]  What are we going to cover next?
[01:25:52.328 --> 01:26:03.751]  Well, I'd like to pick up on the whole issue of the erosion of the mandates and the data that are coming forward on masking, social distancing, lockdowns.
[01:26:04.312 --> 01:26:08.373]  And it's a real indictment that just came out of Johns Hopkins.
[01:26:08.993 --> 01:26:15.835]  And Marty Macri, who's also one of my colleagues from Johns Hopkins, frequent contributor on Fox News, it's become clear now.
[01:26:16.463 --> 01:26:24.589]  That the virus wasn't impacted at all by social distancing, wearing masks, or lockdowns, and they've caused irreparable harm.
[01:26:25.429 --> 01:26:33.395]  Harm on an individual psychological level, from a sociological level, economic, you know, this is irrecoverable.
[01:26:33.435 --> 01:26:41.840]  We can't go backwards now because children have been impacted, families have been fractured, there are suicides we can't get back.
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:50.006]   You know, there's more suicides in the military Then military actually getting serious COVID-19 or dying with COVID-19.
[01:26:50.506 --> 01:26:53.506]  The same thing would be true in teenagers.
[01:26:53.506 --> 01:26:54.506]  So they...
[01:26:54.506 --> 01:26:55.506]  Dr. McCullough, stay right there.
[01:26:55.506 --> 01:26:58.026]  We're going to come back with 30 more minutes with you.
[01:26:58.026 --> 01:27:00.105]  We really appreciate your time today.
[01:27:00.105 --> 01:27:01.985]   And by the way, I'm going to ask you about this when we come back.
[01:27:01.985 --> 01:27:06.506]   You saw the headline, "Denver won't make adults take the shot or wear masks, but children
[01:27:06.506 --> 01:27:07.506]  have to."
[01:27:07.506 --> 01:27:10.626]   Because that's the little prisoners they've got with the National Education Association
[01:27:10.626 --> 01:27:11.905]  trying to create a cult.
[01:27:11.905 --> 01:27:13.746]  This is a true war crime against humanity.
[01:27:13.746 --> 01:27:18.506]   Ladies and gentlemen, we can't fund ourselves without your support and your word of mouth.
[01:27:18.585 --> 01:27:19.726]  Thank you for keeping us on the air.
[01:27:19.947 --> 01:27:23.390]  Now we're entering the most important fight ever, not just for InfoWars, but everybody.

[01:28:44.602 --> 01:28:50.926]  With the globalists plotting their next big lockdown, or the next phase of the Great Reset, being a staged cyber attack.
[01:28:51.367 --> 01:28:57.431]  With the deep state pushing a civil war, not just here, but in Europe, and war with Russia.
[01:28:57.851 --> 01:29:09.679]  With the massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place, like supply chain breakdowns, you need to get prepared now with high quality storable food that is ready to ship.
[01:29:10.119 --> 01:29:18.326]   And it's been four years since my Patriot Supply at preparewithalex.com has offered the restorable food at 25% off.

[01:29:25.032 --> 01:29:34.400]  A little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at preparewithalex.com on the entire catalog of My Patriot Supply.
[01:29:34.821 --> 01:29:36.502]  Act now, get prepared now.

[01:29:42.119 --> 01:29:42.939]  All right, welcome back.
[01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:45.881]  A lot of stations carry the first five minutes, but some don't.
[01:29:46.521 --> 01:30:05.992]  So I want to ask Dr. Peter McCullough, board-certified cardiologist and one of the main experts out there exposing all this insanity, who's been totally vindicated, to hit some other important subjects so that next segment, when a bunch of stations join us, we can get into the mandates, the lockdowns, the John Hopkins report that broke over a week ago and has gotten almost no coverage.
[01:30:06.032 --> 01:30:06.792]  It's been blacked out.
[01:30:07.192 --> 01:30:08.573]  So that's coming up here in about six minutes.
[01:30:08.593 --> 01:30:10.434]  But what else is on your radar screen, Doc?
[01:30:12.341 --> 01:30:27.813]  Well, I think the big news is that lead attorney Tom Rents and co-counsel Lee Dundas came to the table at the historic Senate panel held on Monday, January 24th, Ron Johnson, COVID-19, a second opinion.
[01:30:27.933 --> 01:30:34.898]  And what Rents and Dundas presented was data from three Department of Defense whistleblowers.
[01:30:35.879 --> 01:30:40.242]  And they gave the Department of Defense data, which is very important.
[01:30:40.845 --> 01:30:49.657]  Because this is clinical data, it's not VAERS, it's not self-reported, where they knew vaccine administration and they knew the diseases that occurred after the vaccine.
[01:30:50.298 --> 01:31:03.923]   And there were several fold increases in neurologic, cardiac, including myocarditis, miscarriages, hematologic disease. Alex, the disclosure was
[01:31:03.923 --> 01:31:08.804]   stunning. Senator Ron Johnson said that those data and reports have been subpoenaed. He
[01:31:08.804 --> 01:31:13.595]   actually took action swiftly to subpoena it to make sure they didn't fudge the numbers
[01:31:13.595 --> 01:31:21.105]   afterwards. So all this basically is out in the open. And that's why when I see Fauci and I
[01:31:21.105 --> 01:31:28.061]   see the head of Pfizer on TV, They don't look as arrogant as they used to look.
[01:31:28.101 --> 01:31:29.843]  They look like the air has been let out of them.
[01:31:31.784 --> 01:31:32.164]  It's true.
[01:31:32.204 --> 01:31:40.367]  I think they know they have a giant safety problem on their hands that, you know, in the Open VAERS system, and they've now clarified this.
[01:31:40.507 --> 01:31:44.248]  I've had some personal communication with a group that runs the Open VAERS system.
[01:31:44.288 --> 01:31:46.369]  It's an overlay, and I've done my own queries.
[01:31:46.549 --> 01:31:48.710]  I've done my own VAERS queries to validate this.
[01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:54.252]  About 90% of what we see in domestic reports, 10% are actually U.S.
[01:31:54.292 --> 01:31:55.072]  that report through.
[01:31:55.092 --> 01:32:01.672]   The vast majority are actually reported by the pharmaceutical companies and then by doctors or other health care workers
[01:32:01.672 --> 01:32:07.872]   to VAERS. Sadly, we're over 21,000 people have lost their lives, about 50%
[01:32:07.872 --> 01:32:13.573]   within two days, 80% within a week. The deaths are very quick. We know that 86%
[01:32:13.573 --> 01:32:17.943]   of the time by McLaughlin and colleagues showed this, that the only cause
[01:32:17.943 --> 01:32:24.413]   is the vaccine. It's a giant signal. We're approaching 400,000 hospitalizations,
[01:32:24.413 --> 01:32:28.752]   ER visits, and office visits for vaccine injuries.
[01:32:28.452 --> 01:32:35.615]  Sadly, we've topped 40,000 now permanently disabled Americans because they've taken a COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:32:35.835 --> 01:32:39.137]  So the sentiment that I'm hearing Alex is that people are furious.
[01:32:39.477 --> 01:32:42.498]  They feel like they've been duped because they took the vaccine.
[01:32:42.778 --> 01:32:44.079]  They got COVID anyway.
[01:32:44.339 --> 01:32:45.679]  They took enormous risks.
[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:52.502]  They've seen family members, friends, church members and others be injured or even worse die after the vaccine.
[01:32:52.903 --> 01:32:55.904]  Americans are becoming furious over the vaccine program.
[01:32:56.826 --> 01:32:58.206]  Well, that was actually my next question.
[01:32:59.387 --> 01:33:00.867]  How are they going to get away with this?
[01:33:01.027 --> 01:33:04.228]  And it's just crazy, because what you're saying is true.
[01:33:04.288 --> 01:33:05.008]  I see it online.
[01:33:05.048 --> 01:33:05.728]  I see it in person.
[01:33:06.028 --> 01:33:09.249]  I know a lot of people took two or three shots, and now they're mad because they got even sicker.
[01:33:09.649 --> 01:33:14.270]  And so they're really angry now that Fauci and others are saying, take four, take five, take six.
[01:33:14.290 --> 01:33:15.031]  Look at Israel.
[01:33:15.371 --> 01:33:16.111]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:33:17.737 --> 01:33:20.118]  You know, the WHO is advising against it now.
[01:33:20.178 --> 01:33:24.939]  The WHO is basically questioned the utility of any further boosters.
[01:33:24.959 --> 01:33:33.822]  And in fact, there's some statements let out by the European Medical Association, European Health Association, saying that the vaccines actually may weaken the immunity.
[01:33:33.842 --> 01:33:38.803]  And there's a good rationale for that because the body continues to be loaded with the spike protein.
[01:33:39.203 --> 01:33:41.504]  So the immune system is basically taxed.
[01:33:41.904 --> 01:33:44.187]  We're trying to clear out this foreign protein.
[01:33:44.207 --> 01:33:48.291]  It gets distributed into the brain, the heart, blood vessels, all through the body.
[01:33:48.772 --> 01:33:55.940]  And then recently, Stephanie Senoff, who's a PhD scientist at MIT, was on Laura Ingram.
[01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:58.282]  And Stephanie and I are publishing together.
[01:33:58.322 --> 01:34:02.607]  She's discovered that the messenger RNA itself travels in exosomes.
[01:34:02.967 --> 01:34:11.432]  And the messenger RNA itself, you know, may be and probably does have direct toxicity in alone and separate from the spike protein.
[01:34:11.852 --> 01:34:20.557]  Clearly exosomes can travel along neurons into the brain and we certainly have a risk of a neurologic injury from the spike protein and the messenger RNA.
[01:34:20.577 --> 01:34:23.899]  I want to talk more about that and then the big news, the lockdown straight ahead.
[01:34:24.639 --> 01:34:29.442]  Dr. Peter McCullough is right up there.
[01:34:32.637 --> 01:34:40.803]  Exposing and fighting the biomedical, world government, world ID, world social credit score, vaccine passport takeover.
[01:34:41.163 --> 01:34:42.745]  Because even if these shots work, great!
[01:34:43.675 --> 01:34:48.958]  I'd be taking them, but I wouldn't want the vaccine passport to control and track where I go and what I do.
[01:34:49.038 --> 01:34:51.399]  That's really the big scandal.
[01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:56.622]  And the big corporations admit this is just their power move to get total control over our lives.
[01:34:57.063 --> 01:34:58.163]  They consolidate control.
[01:34:58.203 --> 01:35:04.467]  But you were getting into, and I'm glad you bring this up, because I've been making this point all week long, and so did Paul Watson when he was on yesterday.
[01:35:06.064 --> 01:35:08.367]  I read this whole thing when it came out a week ago or so.
[01:35:08.908 --> 01:35:27.515]   It's only 60-something pages long, and a lot of it I've seen in the news, I've heard from you and others, but it's outrageous to have John Hopkins, one of the most respected medical university systems in the world, that actually quarterbacked a lot of the whole COVID tyranny, coming out from the belly of the beast and saying this didn't help
[01:35:27.515 --> 01:35:31.755]   anybody and this caused mass suicide and depression and death and
[01:35:31.755 --> 01:35:37.036]   not to mention destroyed the economy and amidst that and consolidated power but all the big billionaires on
[01:35:37.036 --> 01:35:41.155]   average doubled their wealth so now we see
[01:35:41.155 --> 01:35:44.435]   where this is all going. Why did so many American mainstream media
[01:35:44.435 --> 01:35:49.676]   outlets ignore the reputable university study that lockdowns didn't work?
[01:35:49.676 --> 01:35:53.414]   John Hopkins study, lockdowns did not reduce COVID deaths but had devastating
[01:35:53.414 --> 01:35:56.916]   effects close quote on society
[01:35:56.916 --> 01:36:01.515]   that's another headline. New John Hopkins study, lockdowns have had
[01:36:01.515 --> 01:36:06.328]   little to no public health health effects, close quoted, imposed enormous economic and
[01:36:06.328 --> 01:36:06.929]  social costs.
[01:36:06.929 --> 01:36:08.050]  Those are quotes.
[01:36:08.050 --> 01:36:15.489]   And so when you read InfoWars, you have to believe me, we link to the actual study here right now.
[01:36:15.489 --> 01:36:17.929]  So, Dr. Peter McCullough, you've read this.
[01:36:17.929 --> 01:36:19.609]  This is a huge story.
[01:36:19.609 --> 01:36:20.688]  Why is it so big?
[01:36:20.688 --> 01:36:22.809]  And please go over it for us.
[01:36:22.809 --> 01:36:24.130]  Alex, it's cohesive.
[01:36:24.130 --> 01:36:28.449]   I think the main thing I want your audience to understand is cohesive.
[01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:34.130]   So Jay Bhattacharya, who testified in the Senate panel by video, presented the principles
[01:36:34.130 --> 01:36:38.849]   of the Great Barrington Declaration, which was signed in mid-2020.
[01:36:38.818 --> 01:36:46.282]  And it was clear the Great Barrington Declaration, of which had thousands and thousands of experts signed, said, listen, no lockdowns.
[01:36:46.462 --> 01:36:46.963]  Don't do it.
[01:36:47.383 --> 01:36:48.483]  It's going to cause harm.
[01:36:49.264 --> 01:36:57.386]   Scott Atlas, who was on the White House task force, going to cause harm.
[01:36:57.386 --> 01:37:00.985]   We had Paul Alexander, advisor to President Trump and then the WHO.
[01:37:00.985 --> 01:37:02.226]  Paul testified at the Senate.
[01:37:02.226 --> 01:37:03.746]  Paul showed all the data.
[01:37:03.746 --> 01:37:08.266]   There was no benefit to public masking, no benefit to lockdowns from all the
[01:37:08.266 --> 01:37:11.945]   studies, Paul has tabulated this in the Brownstone Institute.
[01:37:11.945 --> 01:37:16.505]   And then this paper comes out from Johns Hopkins, really a meta-analysis
[01:37:16.505 --> 01:37:18.305]  synthesizing all the information.
[01:37:18.305 --> 01:37:19.664]  It's conclusive.
[01:37:19.664 --> 01:37:22.226]  It's not just one person.
[01:37:24.386 --> 01:37:28.386]   It is clear that it was a colossal mistake to ever put a mask
[01:37:28.386 --> 01:37:29.744]  on somebody without symptoms.
[01:37:29.744 --> 01:37:32.226]   It was a colossal mistake to have people stay in their homes
[01:37:32.226 --> 01:37:33.466]  who didn't have COVID-19.
[01:37:33.466 --> 01:37:36.305]   The only people who needed to quarantine was the small fraction of people who
[01:37:36.305 --> 01:37:37.945]  are sick at any given time.
[01:37:37.945 --> 01:37:41.626]   And we only quarantine when we give early treatment in order to basically
[01:37:41.626 --> 01:37:44.226]  make the syndrome resolve.
[01:37:44.745 --> 01:37:53.887]  So we have a situation here where the social and psychological and economic impact is disastrous.
[01:37:54.207 --> 01:38:05.669]  And now there are three more analyses, one by Subramanian, Kampff and Beattie, all showing from a medical perspective, the mass vaccination program was a colossal disaster.
[01:38:05.969 --> 01:38:12.470]  So everywhere where there's a greater intensity of vaccination, there are more and more COVID-19 cases.
[01:38:13.630 --> 01:38:14.511]  And there's more deaths.
[01:38:15.112 --> 01:38:23.259]  So it's clear that from the very beginning there wasn't a single step that was taken from a public health perspective that turned out to be a correct step.
[01:38:25.161 --> 01:38:25.922]  We've got a clip.
[01:38:25.942 --> 01:38:27.803]  I know you're familiar with him talking about it.
[01:38:27.823 --> 01:38:30.566]  A lot of scientists and epidemiologists and virologists have talked about it.
[01:38:30.606 --> 01:38:48.644]   But what about what Malone keeps pointing out a year ago and now currently has been proven, at least by what I've seen as a layperson, That when you give a bunch of so-called vaccines or gene therapies to people, while a virus is in the middle of a big blow-up, you're going to put evolutionary stress on it, and you're going to make super viruses come out.
[01:38:48.664 --> 01:38:59.534]  So, whereas normally viruses get less lethal over time, that actually doing a mass injection program, a vaccine during it, can actually create even more deadly ones and cause all sorts of problems.
[01:39:00.114 --> 01:39:00.955]  What is your view of that?
[01:39:02.252 --> 01:39:10.558]  You know, I think to unpack it, now I'm an internist and cardiologist, I'm a trained epidemiologist, and I've been focusing on this for two years now, Alex.
[01:39:10.598 --> 01:39:17.523]  I basically have a fellowship in at least COVID-19 infectious disease, and I see and examine patients and I treat them.
[01:39:18.463 --> 01:39:28.527]   My view on this is that it's clear in analyses by Nissen, Venkata, Krishnan and others, including the original report on the
[01:39:28.527 --> 01:39:36.617]   border of Botswana of Omicron, is clear that mass vaccination has promoted the advancement
[01:39:36.617 --> 01:39:43.146]   of super dominant mutants. We went from a blend of wild type alpha, beta, gamma into a super
[01:39:43.146 --> 01:39:49.466]   dominant delta as a result of mass vaccination and then super dominant delta right into super
[01:39:49.466 --> 01:39:54.117]   dominant Omicron. Literally, it just changed within a few weeks. The only thing that can do that
[01:39:54.117 --> 01:39:58.957]   is mass vaccination because the immunity is so narrow. What the virus is doing is it's
[01:39:58.957 --> 01:40:01.326]  taking advantage of the nasal cavity.
[01:40:01.537 --> 01:40:06.138]  So with Omicron, it replicates 70 times faster than that of Delta in the nasal cavity.
[01:40:06.258 --> 01:40:11.500]  It closes the immunologic door on Omicron by forming immunity against Delta.
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.820]  I'm sorry, so Omicron forms immunity against Delta.
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:17.021]  Omicron obviously forms great immunity against itself.
[01:40:17.761 --> 01:40:27.997]   So what we're seeing is the virus is climbing Call it a bottleneck and then it finds a way to innovate and survive.
[01:40:28.017 --> 01:40:34.841]  If we didn't have the vaccine program, it's my estimation that the whole pandemic would have been closed by this time.
[01:40:35.061 --> 01:40:43.466]  We haven't seen the specter of what Van der Bosch and Malone have implicated, that we have a hyperdominant strain that's more lethal.
[01:40:43.526 --> 01:40:45.587]  Thank goodness that hasn't happened yet.
[01:40:46.568 --> 01:40:55.497]  But we must stop vaccination now in order to let diversity in natural immunity and diversity in the viral strains come back into play.
[01:40:55.778 --> 01:40:56.258]  What about ADE?
[01:40:58.499 --> 01:41:06.645]  You know, outside of a paper by Li Yu and colleagues, I looked at that carefully, that from a preclinical perspective suggests it could happen.
[01:41:06.925 --> 01:41:12.209]  And then the burst of cases we see after shot number one with the messenger RNA vaccines.
[01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:14.330]  This is the Pfizer briefing booklet, by the way.
[01:41:14.671 --> 01:41:17.693]  I think that's the only manifestation of ADE we've seen.
[01:41:17.933 --> 01:41:24.997]   Remember, antibody-dependent enhancement means the disease is enhanced or more More severe, and so far we haven't seen that.
[01:41:25.258 --> 01:41:30.640]  I can tell you, Alex, and you probably can attest to this yourself, Omicron's a far milder syndrome.
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:32.321]  Oh yeah, I was not even worried about cold at all.
[01:41:32.341 --> 01:41:33.682]  Yeah.
[01:41:33.862 --> 01:41:36.483]  Yeah, but Delta, man, I felt like that was rough.
[01:41:37.464 --> 01:41:37.644]  Right.
[01:41:38.464 --> 01:41:40.025]  It was definitely not the flu or a cold.
[01:41:40.045 --> 01:41:41.005]  I've never been sick like that.
[01:41:41.045 --> 01:41:42.126]  You can tell, like, this is new.
[01:41:43.795 --> 01:41:44.535]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:41:44.615 --> 01:41:49.696]  I think most people, and by the way, I was on Fox News, Marty McAleer was on the week this came out.
[01:41:50.456 --> 01:41:53.337]  Omicron is basically acting like a natural booster.
[01:41:53.717 --> 01:41:59.338]  It's boosting the immunity of someone who's COVID recovered, but it's also boosting the immunity of the vaccinated.
[01:41:59.378 --> 01:42:02.398]  So I tell many of my vaccinated patients, listen, it's not a bad thing.
[01:42:02.998 --> 01:42:04.218]  It's a very mild syndrome.
[01:42:04.258 --> 01:42:11.780]  Well, I know you don't like to speculate, but a lot of scientists have looked at it and said it looks like it was built to counter what was built by what looks like Fauci.
[01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:14.121]  How do we speculate?
[01:42:14.161 --> 01:42:17.043]  How do we know, looking at what happened with Omicron?
[01:42:18.024 --> 01:42:18.884]  It's hard to know.
[01:42:18.924 --> 01:42:23.368]  Remember, most mutations are either deletions or substitutions.
[01:42:23.808 --> 01:42:26.890]  The unique thing with Omicron, it actually had an insertion.
[01:42:27.411 --> 01:42:31.174]  So it actually had some new code inserted into the receptor binding domain.
[01:42:31.214 --> 01:42:33.215]  So, I mean, that's what's raised the speculation.
[01:42:34.556 --> 01:42:41.942]  I mean, again, I'm not a genetic engineer, but like a lot of the big institutions even said, wow, what, it's like 20 plus changes just in the spike protein?
[01:42:43.166 --> 01:42:48.132]  I was actually 30 in the spike protein, but it's peppered around the receptor binding domain.
[01:42:48.172 --> 01:42:51.195]  I showed your audience that diagram from Venkata Krishnan.
[01:42:51.215 --> 01:42:54.719]  You know, there's a company in Boston called Inference, and they're doing great work.
[01:42:55.039 --> 01:42:57.943]  They're doing great sequencing work using modeling.
[01:42:58.503 --> 01:43:01.545]  And you know, there's actually a lot of great science out there, Alex.
[01:43:01.605 --> 01:43:02.605]  It's not all bad.
[01:43:03.145 --> 01:43:08.348]  And you know, the medical field is advancing in its understanding of COVID-19.
[01:43:09.048 --> 01:43:15.531]  It's just that I think at this point, Tom, we need to drop the mandates, pull the vaccines off the market, and then let us treat the final cases.
[01:43:15.711 --> 01:43:16.871]  I want to be clear.
[01:43:17.092 --> 01:43:17.772]  It's like a gun.
[01:43:18.352 --> 01:43:25.480]  A gun can be used to hunt food, or defend yourself, or it can be used to rob people, or a tractor can be used to pull houses down, or, you know, plow fields.
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:33.268]  So I'm all for science, I just don't want the bad guys having control of it, and then silencing us, because isn't science about second and third opinions and open debate?
[01:43:33.528 --> 01:43:36.552]  Isn't the idea that don't question science, isn't that the opposite of science?
[01:43:37.885 --> 01:43:38.165]  It is.
[01:43:38.386 --> 01:43:41.609]  Science is all about discourse and debate.
[01:43:41.829 --> 01:43:43.110]  This happened in the Senate panel.
[01:43:43.130 --> 01:43:43.871]  People disagreed.
[01:43:43.931 --> 01:43:45.332]  I pointed it out to Senator Ron Johnson.
[01:43:45.653 --> 01:43:48.576]  Disagreement is normal for us to advance the field.
[01:43:49.456 --> 01:43:49.737]  Wow.
[01:43:50.217 --> 01:43:51.699]  Dr. Peter McCullough, final segment.
[01:43:52.039 --> 01:43:52.860]  So much to hit.
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:53.460]  Stay with us.
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:54.862]  And I got big breaking news after he goes.
[01:43:55.102 --> 01:43:56.223]  We're so thankful for him being here.
[01:43:56.243 --> 01:44:01.168]  I want to thank Dr. Peter McCullough for his tireless service to truth.
[01:44:02.106 --> 01:44:12.469]  And to freedom and to my family and your family everybody's family because it wasn't for integrity of people like him and just the Armies of good doctors and scientists the vast majority of them.
[01:44:12.509 --> 01:44:15.690]  It's very few That'll actually even get up there and chill.
[01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:21.211]  That's why there's like 10 or 15 you see internationally Up there and they're loathed and they're hated.
[01:44:21.271 --> 01:44:23.752]  I mean humanity is really seeing through them.
[01:44:23.812 --> 01:44:29.542]   So he will always tends to win up front, but very soon people turn against it.
[01:44:29.542 --> 01:44:33.221]   And that's why I love Dr. Peter McCullough, because I'm a factoid obsessed person.
[01:44:33.221 --> 01:44:35.221]  I read news constantly. I'm addicted to it.
[01:44:35.221 --> 01:44:37.141]  And I don't just read news because I want to believe it.
[01:44:37.141 --> 01:44:38.621]  I go research it, try to find out the truth.
[01:44:38.621 --> 01:44:39.862]  And most of the time I'm right.
[01:44:39.862 --> 01:44:43.461]   Sometimes I'm wrong, but we're always finding out more.
[01:44:43.461 --> 01:44:47.702]   He just mentioned last segment real fast as he rattles off all this data to you
[01:44:47.702 --> 01:44:50.101]  for you to go check that, oh.
[01:44:50.101 --> 01:44:54.542]  The senator in this hearing, they had put him on notice.
[01:44:54.542 --> 01:44:56.820]  Do not destroy the data. Do not change the data.
[01:44:56.820 --> 01:45:00.302]  And here's the letter he just mentioned.
[01:45:00.302 --> 01:45:01.662]  Honorable Lloyd J.
[01:45:01.662 --> 01:45:08.782]   Austin, Secretary of Defense, from the senator saying, do not destroy this information.
[01:45:08.782 --> 01:45:10.302]  And then sure enough.
[01:45:10.996 --> 01:45:30.307]  Within 24 hours of that happening, the articles on Infowars.com by Don Salazar, with links to the Defense Department's own site, DOD claims glitch in database after attorney exposes skyrocketing military vaccine injuries, and now the FDA suddenly scrubs Moderna document from website after reporters ask question.
[01:45:30.628 --> 01:45:33.932]   This is what guilty people Do.
[01:45:33.972 --> 01:45:36.555]  So you mentioned, Senator Ron Johnson, him doing this.
[01:45:36.855 --> 01:45:46.645]  Here's the letter bringing up the hypertension, diseases of nervous system, 1,000 plus percent, hypertension 2,000 plus, malignant neoplasms, 894.
[01:45:47.666 --> 01:45:49.567]  This is what their own data shows.
[01:45:49.647 --> 01:45:50.949]  It mirrors data out of Europe.
[01:45:51.309 --> 01:45:53.471]  And boy, they are trying to spike this right now.
[01:45:53.992 --> 01:45:56.074]  I tell you, this is amazing.
[01:45:56.094 --> 01:45:58.296]  You talk about hand in the cookie jar here, doctor.
[01:45:59.677 --> 01:46:04.218]  You know, this is the first time that I've seen data, aggregate data, on cancer.
[01:46:04.818 --> 01:46:07.579]  And note, it was breast cancer that was the lead.
[01:46:08.199 --> 01:46:12.480]  You know, there had been a paper published earlier, a lot of people, you know, overlooked it.
[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:26.003]  It was published by the University of Pittsburgh, showing that the S2 segment of the spike protein, which is produced in those who take the vaccine, it interacts with the BRCA, or the BRCA gene, which controls breast cancer and female reproductive cancer.
[01:46:26.363 --> 01:46:29.563]  Now we have the data emerging from the DoD.
[01:46:29.563 --> 01:46:35.722]   Now, it's either discovery bias, that is people held back on mammograms
[01:46:35.722 --> 01:46:39.682]   and they held back on other screenings, or in fact, it's real,
[01:46:39.682 --> 01:46:42.402]  that it's an explosive rise in cancer.
[01:46:42.402 --> 01:46:45.882]  Pathologist Ryan Cole testified in the Senate committee.
[01:46:45.882 --> 01:46:47.123]  He thought it was real.
[01:46:47.123 --> 01:46:50.123]   I've talked to Scott Atlas, and I tend to agree with Scott.
[01:46:49.845 --> 01:47:10.602]  I think it's probably discovery bias, but I tell you, those who are on this cancer trail right now, this is worrisome because, you know, so many people have accepted the vaccines, they never understood what was in them, and now the first DoD hard data under file, Senator Ron Johnson, and this, all this is going to generate tremendous investigation.
[01:47:11.083 --> 01:47:25.701]   Because you know... Let me stop you there, because you've been out for a long time talking about this, but I remember I remember Dr. Yidan, former chief scientist over vaccines and respiratory stuff at Pfizer and others, and Wolfgang Woodard writing that lawsuit in late 2020 to the EU saying, don't do this.
[01:47:26.061 --> 01:47:30.143]  It's going to cause myocarditis, heart attacks, infertility, blood clots, cancer.
[01:47:30.423 --> 01:47:34.284]  And then the CDC had a document in October of 2020 saying the same thing.
[01:47:34.324 --> 01:47:41.026]  So even before it started, the experts knew this would happen, both the good guys, the bad guys, and I guess the asleep people.
[01:47:41.366 --> 01:47:42.707]  So that's why this is so powerful.
[01:47:43.147 --> 01:47:48.528]  Exactly what the CDC predicted, exactly what other scientists warned, is exactly what happened.
[01:47:48.648 --> 01:47:49.988]  I call that pretty damn conclusive.
[01:47:50.208 --> 01:47:57.870]  Like, I don't need to be a pathologist to know, if I stick a 12-gauge shotgun in my mouth, a double-locked buck, and pull it, the back of my head's gonna blow off, it's gonna kill me, probably.
[01:47:58.090 --> 01:47:59.330]  Or maybe I'll live, be a vegetable.
[01:47:59.650 --> 01:48:01.910]  So, they told me, you take this, this happens.
[01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:03.171]  It happened, I saw it happen.
[01:48:03.431 --> 01:48:06.171]  So it's like, don't run in traffic, a bus is gonna kill you.
[01:48:06.471 --> 01:48:10.412]  I mean, I don't need to be a scientist to know this, it's very obvious what's going on here.
[01:48:11.607 --> 01:48:24.117]  Well, on that CDC slide, which I believe is from their meeting in October of 2020, you know, they had all the neurologic, hematologic, and cardiac problems, but notice there's no cancer on that slide, no cancer.
[01:48:24.738 --> 01:48:31.203]  And I think that the DOD data, which I said is the first aggregate data I've seen now on cancer, is explosive.
[01:48:31.423 --> 01:48:45.279]   A lot of the things on this slide, there's official FDA warnings, you know, there's warnings for Guillain-Barre syndrome, there's warnings for anaphylaxis, there's warnings for myocarditis. Even in the EUA documents, the consent form,
[01:48:45.279 --> 01:48:47.369]  consent form lists that death can happen.
[01:48:47.369 --> 01:48:53.690]   So you're right, this is transparent. Most of this, Alex, is really buyer beware. The people
[01:48:53.690 --> 01:48:58.010]   who are signing up and taking the vaccine, they really need to know what they're getting into.
[01:48:58.010 --> 01:49:03.930]   The FDA has laid it out here and the surprise was the cancer.
[01:49:04.574 --> 01:49:11.544]  In a recent program that I held, a public program in Wichita, Kansas, we had Chris Kobach as co-presenter.
[01:49:11.844 --> 01:49:15.750]  He's running for the AG in Kansas, terrific constitutional lawyer.
[01:49:16.647 --> 01:49:18.830]  And also Physician State Senator.
[01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:20.592]  But we had a private doctor's meeting, Alex.
[01:49:21.053 --> 01:49:27.461]  And the question that was asked was, what percent of patients do you think took the vaccine for medical reasons?
[01:49:27.921 --> 01:49:30.625]  And what percent do you think were forced into it because of their job?
[01:49:30.865 --> 01:49:33.068]  And you know what the general gestalt was?
[01:49:33.088 --> 01:49:33.108]  50-50.
[01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:35.170]  Wow.
[01:49:35.190 --> 01:49:40.752]  So I can tell you, 50% of people who took the vaccine are really angry.
[01:49:41.352 --> 01:49:45.054]  They were forced into it, and now we've got a safety nightmare.
[01:49:45.074 --> 01:49:49.535]  Well, that's where I'm going in closing, and I appreciate your time, and I hope to get you in the studio soon, you and your wonderful wife.
[01:49:49.935 --> 01:49:51.656]  I love visiting with you and your crew.
[01:49:53.657 --> 01:49:56.858]  I guess we talked in text message the other day, and you said, I think the worm's turning.
[01:49:56.898 --> 01:49:58.578]  I think the word you used, we've hit the tipping point.
[01:49:58.958 --> 01:49:59.959]  And I think that's clear.
[01:50:00.019 --> 01:50:03.440]  Why are you saying we've hit the tipping point in understanding and awakening to this?
[01:50:04.662 --> 01:50:12.905]  I'm getting more and more messages from academic physicians, doctors who in my circle who were previously quiet and now they're coming out saying, you know, I'm really with you here.
[01:50:12.965 --> 01:50:14.185]  I'm starting to see this.
[01:50:14.265 --> 01:50:15.706]  We understand your viewpoint.
[01:50:16.366 --> 01:50:19.447]  I just had a very high level administrator who I worked with for years.
[01:50:20.207 --> 01:50:21.547]  He's now in the biotech industry.
[01:50:21.587 --> 01:50:24.488]  He just got COVID himself and he went on this scramble.
[01:50:24.508 --> 01:50:26.088]  He had severe his immunocompromised.
[01:50:26.108 --> 01:50:27.128]  He had severe symptoms.
[01:50:27.528 --> 01:50:31.869]  We got him early treatment through one of our early treatment networks and he texted me this morning.
[01:50:31.909 --> 01:50:35.170]  He says he says now I understand now.
[01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:44.311]  I understand the struggle this chill that was put on early treatment the suppression of early treatment and the forcing the mass vaccination, you know, he feels burned.
[01:50:44.611 --> 01:50:45.511]  He took the vaccine.
[01:50:45.551 --> 01:50:49.172]  He got severe COVID anyway, and now he can't get early treatment.
[01:50:52.157 --> 01:50:52.818]  Well, exactly.
[01:50:52.878 --> 01:50:54.338]  My dad was dying.
[01:50:54.418 --> 01:50:55.859]  Didn't tell me he was sick for eight days.
[01:50:56.039 --> 01:50:56.599]  Almost died.
[01:50:56.639 --> 01:50:57.500]  82% oxygen.
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:04.002]  Within a day of ivermectin and zinc and Z-Pak and inhalable steroids, he was back.
[01:51:04.143 --> 01:51:04.663]  He was back.
[01:51:05.063 --> 01:51:06.984]  He had some brain fog for a while, but he was back.
[01:51:07.004 --> 01:51:10.805]  I mean, I had it, and as soon as I got on the drugs, I felt a lot better.
[01:51:10.845 --> 01:51:11.906]  It was like night and day.
[01:51:11.926 --> 01:51:18.289]  And then imagine that being denied when you take your husband or wife or child to the hospital, and they're denying you this stuff.
[01:51:18.309 --> 01:51:18.969]  That's insane.
[01:51:20.529 --> 01:51:23.810]  You know, I published a paper with Fazio and colleagues from Italy.
[01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:26.951]  It just hit, it was published in the Medical Science Monitor.
[01:51:27.071 --> 01:51:31.792]  And the point of the paper, Alex, is the golden window for treatment is the first three days.
[01:51:32.452 --> 01:51:33.512]  That's where it's all at.
[01:51:33.552 --> 01:51:36.813]  If you can hit it in the first three days, patients turn around quickly.
[01:51:36.853 --> 01:51:38.433]  This case I mentioned last night touched me.
[01:51:38.453 --> 01:51:41.474]  This is already better because we got him on day two.
[01:51:41.754 --> 01:51:44.035]  There still are going to be a few high risk people.
[01:51:44.335 --> 01:51:47.455]  They must seek early treatment in the first three days.
[01:51:47.495 --> 01:51:49.536]  Hospitalization is completely avoidable.
[01:51:49.716 --> 01:51:50.157]  That's right.
[01:51:50.197 --> 01:51:51.298]  This is not a joke, folks.
[01:51:51.318 --> 01:51:54.563]  You go to the hospital, they turn you away and wait until you're too sick, and then they intubate you.
[01:51:54.903 --> 01:51:55.704]  This is life and death.
[01:51:55.724 --> 01:51:59.369]  You start getting sick now, you better do the pre-treatments or you're in big trouble.
[01:51:59.629 --> 01:52:02.193]  Dr. McCullough, thank you so much for the incredible time.
[01:52:02.213 --> 01:52:04.977]  Everybody should follow you on Twitter and any other sites.
[01:52:05.037 --> 01:52:06.659]  Where's the best place to find everything?
[01:52:06.679 --> 01:52:07.400]  Dr. Peter McCullough.
[01:52:08.579 --> 01:52:14.680]  America Out Loud Talk Radio, the McCullough Report, weekly report to the nation, and guests from all over.
[01:52:14.740 --> 01:52:22.442]  It's not just my voice, and it's a great, great way to basically become updated on the podcast circuit.
[01:52:22.602 --> 01:52:28.283]  It's produced... Yeah, you're doing a beautiful job, and just as our listeners already know a lot of this, share with everybody, this is life and death.
[01:52:28.323 --> 01:52:30.783]  Yeah, we're starting to win, but we haven't completely won yet.
[01:52:31.043 --> 01:52:31.803]  God bless you, doctor.
[01:52:31.823 --> 01:52:32.403]  Have a great weekend.
[01:52:33.464 --> 01:52:33.784]  Thank you.
[01:52:33.984 --> 01:52:34.864]  We'll be back with a bunch of news.
[01:52:34.884 --> 01:52:35.184]  Stay with us.
[01:52:36.423 --> 01:52:41.344]  All right, I probably covered 20% of the news today, which is good because there's just so damn much of it.
[01:52:42.485 --> 01:52:44.165]  And I kind of want to let the crew off tomorrow.
[01:52:44.185 --> 01:52:46.405]  I've been doing Saturday shows a lot that are very popular.
[01:52:46.425 --> 01:52:46.986]  But you know what?
[01:52:47.026 --> 01:52:47.766]  We just can't do it.
[01:52:47.806 --> 01:52:48.906]  The crew wants to come in anyways.
[01:52:49.726 --> 01:52:53.987]  So ladies and gentlemen, let's just pick a time.
[01:52:54.027 --> 01:52:54.768]  Let's do it again.
[01:52:54.828 --> 01:52:58.628]  Let's go live tomorrow at 2 p.m.
[01:52:58.668 --> 01:53:07.349]   Central for two hours, commercial free, to get to all this I didn't get to and To cover more than will obviously break by then.
[01:53:07.869 --> 01:53:10.590]  Because I got to 20%, but don't you want to hear all the rest of this?
[01:53:11.210 --> 01:53:12.550]  Because it's all just as important.
[01:53:12.570 --> 01:53:17.631]  I mean, it's crazy, crazy level important here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:19.331 --> 01:53:32.894]  Let me go ahead, though, and get to this, because this is one of those stories that is so complex and so interesting, but also so simple at many levels, that if you understand this piece of information, you basically understand it all.
[01:53:33.863 --> 01:53:36.724]  And that is the State Department having a press briefing.
[01:53:36.784 --> 01:53:38.044]  An Associated Press writer.
[01:53:38.664 --> 01:53:41.925]  It's one of the top stories, if not the top story, in the last 24 hours.
[01:53:42.305 --> 01:53:42.905]  It's everywhere.
[01:53:43.345 --> 01:53:44.365]  All over foreign news.
[01:53:44.705 --> 01:53:45.765]  Top of all the channels.
[01:53:45.825 --> 01:53:46.606]  Top trending.
[01:53:46.846 --> 01:53:49.586]  Trended number one last night without me even looking for it.
[01:53:49.606 --> 01:53:52.207]  Everybody's calling like, you're the number one on Twitter and Instagram.
[01:53:52.447 --> 01:53:53.187]  Ten million views.
[01:53:53.227 --> 01:53:53.967]  Five million views.
[01:53:54.007 --> 01:53:54.607]  Eight million views.
[01:53:55.167 --> 01:53:57.988]  And it's all, oh, you're in Alex Jones territory.
[01:53:58.528 --> 01:54:01.211]  Well, I mean, I think we're all kind of in Alex Jones territory.
[01:54:01.651 --> 01:54:04.714]  Because Alex Jones sees what's going on, so do you.
[01:54:05.235 --> 01:54:06.036]  And we're not stupid.
[01:54:06.516 --> 01:54:10.520]  So false flags are very, very real in world history.
[01:54:10.540 --> 01:54:12.562]  I'm going to show you some proof of that here in a moment.
[01:54:13.817 --> 01:54:34.297]  Because unlike the spokesperson for the State Department, I'll show you my proof that false flags are a real thing, that are done sometimes, that could be happening anytime there's an event, so we should look for those and ask, as the Romans did in Latin, qui bono, qui bono, who stands to gain, who has the motive, who benefits.
[01:54:34.337 --> 01:54:43.777]   So, the Alex Jones territory Is the reporter saying saying that governments might stage terror to launch a war is Alex Jones territory?
[01:54:43.857 --> 01:54:45.358]  Well, no, that's a real thing that could happen.
[01:54:45.838 --> 01:54:47.539]  The West has a bigger history of doing it.
[01:54:47.819 --> 01:54:49.380]  I don't believe Joe Biden who controls him.
[01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:50.781]  The Russians don't want a war.
[01:54:52.082 --> 01:54:52.642]  The U.S.
[01:54:52.742 --> 01:54:56.024]  and NATO are massing troops in Ukraine.
[01:54:56.084 --> 01:54:57.905]  That's why Russia's massing troops on the border.
[01:54:58.665 --> 01:54:59.525]  We do the same thing.
[01:54:59.766 --> 01:55:00.326]  It's just a fact.
[01:55:01.272 --> 01:55:03.294]  So they don't want you questioning events.
[01:55:03.314 --> 01:55:05.095]  They don't want you questioning Jussie Smollett.
[01:55:05.395 --> 01:55:09.178]  They don't want you questioning WMDs in Iraq, the Gulf of Tonkin, all this.
[01:55:09.599 --> 01:55:15.684]  Because when you do, you usually find out it's staged as a pretext for the war.
[01:55:15.704 --> 01:55:21.062]   I'm going to show you some historical examples that are admitted That I guess this AP reporter doesn't want known.
[01:55:21.303 --> 01:55:23.644]  Now, do I believe the rat-like State Department spokesman?
[01:55:23.924 --> 01:55:27.327]  Do I believe the Russians really are planting a false flag and that Biden has proof?
[01:55:27.387 --> 01:55:27.547]  No.
[01:55:28.007 --> 01:55:28.428]  The U.S.
[01:55:28.488 --> 01:55:28.988]  is massing.
[01:55:29.008 --> 01:55:29.969]  The globalists are massing.
[01:55:30.369 --> 01:55:33.391]  They want to let Russia know, if you try to fight back, we're going to call it a false flag.
[01:55:33.671 --> 01:55:36.013]  And when we attack your troops, we're going to say you did it.
[01:55:36.734 --> 01:55:38.035]  That's where all the money's at.
[01:55:38.075 --> 01:55:39.676]  That's where all the history's at.
[01:55:39.716 --> 01:55:41.097]  That's where the motive is.
[01:55:42.751 --> 01:55:45.254]  Doesn't mean I lionize the Russians or say they're perfect either.
[01:55:45.715 --> 01:55:53.604]  But the motive and the history and the cutting off the Russian pipelines and the triggering the revolution in Ukraine, that's been the West doing that.
[01:55:54.085 --> 01:55:57.649]  And then drawing Russia in to start a new Cold War.
[01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:58.550]  That's what's happening.
[01:55:58.570 --> 01:55:59.431]  And Putin said that.
[01:55:59.791 --> 01:56:02.655]  He's been trying to stop that, even cut their defense spending five years ago.
[01:56:03.982 --> 01:56:05.263]  So here's the bizarre exchange.
[01:56:05.303 --> 01:56:09.728]  Journalist says State Department engaging in Alex Jones level Russian false flag conspiracies.
[01:56:10.449 --> 01:56:13.992]  So now talking about a historical thing that governments do do, it's bad.
[01:56:14.032 --> 01:56:15.153]  It's Alex Jones territory.
[01:56:15.534 --> 01:56:16.715]  But see the trap now?
[01:56:17.336 --> 01:56:18.537]  See the trap now they're all in?
[01:56:18.577 --> 01:56:19.378]  Here's part of the exchange.
[01:56:20.843 --> 01:56:23.607]  Okay, well that's quite a mouthful there.
[01:56:24.188 --> 01:56:28.295]  So you said actions such as these suggest otherwise.
[01:56:28.515 --> 01:56:34.084]  Suggest meaning that they suggest they're not interested in talks and they're going to go ahead with something.
[01:56:34.144 --> 01:56:35.326]  What action are you talking about?
[01:56:36.736 --> 01:56:38.917]  One, the actions I've just pointed to.
[01:56:38.937 --> 01:56:40.217]  What actions?
[01:56:40.257 --> 01:56:45.279]  The fact that Russia continues to engage in disinformation campaigns.
[01:56:45.299 --> 01:56:48.380]  You know, you made an allegation that they might do that.
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:50.301]  Have they actually done it?
[01:56:50.501 --> 01:56:56.803]  What we know, Matt, is what I've just said, that they have engaged in this activity, in this planning activity.
[01:56:58.644 --> 01:57:05.008]  Because obviously this is not the first time we've made these reports public.
[01:57:05.329 --> 01:57:07.210]  You'll remember that just a few weeks ago.
[01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:09.932]  I'm sorry, made what report public?
[01:57:10.592 --> 01:57:13.094]  If you let me finish, I will tell you what report we made public.
[01:57:13.854 --> 01:57:23.341]  We told you a few weeks ago that we have information indicating Russia also has already prepositioned a group of operatives to conduct a false flag operation in eastern Ukraine.
[01:57:23.721 --> 01:57:34.165]   So that, Matt, to your question, is an action that Russia It's an action that you say that they have taken, but you have shown no evidence to confirm that.
[01:57:34.666 --> 01:57:41.348]  And I'm going to get to the next question here, which is, what is the evidence that they... I mean, this is like crisis actors, really?
[01:57:41.408 --> 01:57:45.169]  This is like Alex Jones territory, you're getting into that.
[01:57:45.669 --> 01:57:49.971]  What evidence do you have to support the idea that there is some... All right, let's hit pause there.
[01:57:50.051 --> 01:57:50.891]  Back it up ten seconds.
[01:57:51.351 --> 01:57:53.472]  This is Alex Jones territory.
[01:57:54.671 --> 01:57:56.872]  What evidence do you have?
[01:57:57.312 --> 01:57:58.292]  He won't give the evidence.
[01:57:58.312 --> 01:57:59.673]  He says, the evidence is I told you.
[01:58:01.153 --> 01:58:12.537]  And so you got Ned Price, the CIA operative, a little swarmy, arrogant know-it-all, obviously up there lying to everybody, not giving any proof, not giving any evidence, saying, I've just given you evidence.
[01:58:12.637 --> 01:58:13.357]  No, you haven't.
[01:58:13.737 --> 01:58:16.158]  But then his counter is, you're in Alex Jones territory.
[01:58:16.538 --> 01:58:17.959]  What, exposing false flags?
[01:58:18.279 --> 01:58:19.199]  Exposing the lies?
[01:58:19.599 --> 01:58:21.000]  Exposing these people are doing this?
[01:58:22.529 --> 01:58:31.357]  So it shows how desperate they are that the power structure is now having its own propaganda used against it because no one buys what the system says.
[01:58:31.797 --> 01:58:36.381]  And then they use the guy exposing not trusting the system as the example of the system.
[01:58:37.182 --> 01:58:38.002]  Now they're getting smart.
[01:58:38.042 --> 01:58:41.726]  I told Politico when Rand Paul got elected years ago, they said, why'd he win?
[01:58:41.766 --> 01:58:42.446]  We threw everything at him.
[01:58:42.466 --> 01:58:44.288]  And I said, if you endorsed him, he'd have lost.
[01:58:47.014 --> 01:58:51.278]  You say, but start calling Joe Biden Alex Jones, that will hurt Alex Jones.
[01:58:51.979 --> 01:58:53.600]  So see, they're starting to get sophisticated here.
[01:58:56.863 --> 01:58:58.424]  I mean, look at that little arrogant swarming.
[01:58:58.504 --> 01:58:59.585]  Oh, he's in the CIA.
[01:58:59.806 --> 01:59:00.586]  Oh my God.
[01:59:00.947 --> 01:59:04.230]  He has the intel no one else has up there lying to us.
[01:59:05.762 --> 01:59:06.182]  Continue.
[01:59:06.523 --> 01:59:11.922]   evidence to confirm that and I'm gonna get to the next question here which is
[01:59:11.922 --> 01:59:16.682]   what is the evidence that they I mean this is like crisis actors really this
[01:59:16.682 --> 01:59:21.643]   is like Alex Jones territory you're getting into that what evidence do you
[01:59:21.643 --> 01:59:26.283]   have to support the idea that there is some propaganda film in the in in the
[01:59:26.283 --> 01:59:33.123]   making now this is derived from information known to the US government
[01:59:30.884 --> 01:59:31.204]  government.
[01:59:31.444 --> 01:59:33.925]  Intelligence information that we have declassified.
[01:59:33.965 --> 01:59:35.406]  Pause again.
[01:59:35.486 --> 01:59:42.890]  Just like I'm a Russian agent, Trump's a Russian agent, the Russians won the election, the truckers are protesting lockdowns because they're Russians.
[01:59:43.411 --> 01:59:45.612]  You're full of crap.
[01:59:46.332 --> 01:59:49.034]  Yeah, there's Jesse Smollett with the rope around his neck with the cops.
[01:59:49.974 --> 01:59:51.475]  Was that Russian disinfo too?
[01:59:52.036 --> 01:59:52.416]  Continue.
[01:59:53.426 --> 01:59:53.827]  Where is it?
[01:59:53.967 --> 01:59:55.230]  Where is this information?
[01:59:55.811 --> 01:59:58.135]  It is intelligence information that we have declassified.
[01:59:58.155 --> 01:59:58.716]  Well, where is it?
[01:59:58.816 --> 02:00:00.239]  Where is the declassified information?
[02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:01.841]  I just delivered it.
[02:00:03.395 --> 02:00:06.216]  No, you made a series of allegations.
[02:00:06.236 --> 02:00:09.678]  This is the gaslighting of the young turds and all those YouTube shows and all of it.
[02:00:09.998 --> 02:00:12.519]  They just go, 90% of people in the hospital take the shot.
[02:00:12.639 --> 02:00:13.700]  It's not true, they just say it.
[02:00:14.180 --> 02:00:14.940]  I just told you.
[02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:17.921]  I just told you, it's classified, I told you it's the case.
[02:00:18.522 --> 02:00:28.586]  Just believe me, I'm swarmy, I have a small neck, and I'm not against small neck people, but this is what the elite thinks powerful, a swarmy, manipulated, you know, don't be mean to the ferrets.
[02:00:31.047 --> 02:00:32.108]  Ferret's much more odd.
[02:00:32.128 --> 02:00:33.428]  I mean, I'm just saying.
[02:00:34.949 --> 02:00:37.110]  Yes, if this guy was a superhero, he'd be super ferret.
[02:00:37.590 --> 02:00:39.931]  But let's continue.
[02:00:39.951 --> 02:00:43.192]  Because you will see a transcript of this briefing that you can print out for yourself.
[02:00:43.273 --> 02:00:44.193]  That's not evidence, Ned.
[02:00:44.253 --> 02:00:45.233]  That's you saying it.
[02:00:45.293 --> 02:00:46.314]  That's not evidence.
[02:00:46.414 --> 02:00:46.894]  I'm sorry.
[02:00:47.715 --> 02:00:48.275]  Hit pause again.
[02:00:50.036 --> 02:00:55.398]  There'll be a transcript of what I just said, and so you can print that off and that's your classified briefing.
[02:00:56.553 --> 02:01:06.716]  And look at his arrogance, his projection of hating everyone, thinking everyone's dumb, thinking he's smarter than you, and now he's being called the devil Alex Jones.
[02:01:07.156 --> 02:01:12.518]  But then in that is the truth, and this is all Alex Jones territory, the fall of this corrupt system.
[02:01:12.738 --> 02:01:13.298]  Let's continue.
[02:01:14.419 --> 02:01:15.099]  What would you like now?
[02:01:16.319 --> 02:01:26.626]   I would like to see some proof that you can show that Matt, you have been... That shows that the Russians are doing this.
[02:01:26.686 --> 02:01:28.567]  Matt, I've been doing this for a long time.
[02:01:28.667 --> 02:01:29.907]  I know, that was my point.
[02:01:30.047 --> 02:01:31.447]  You have been doing this for quite a while.
[02:01:31.507 --> 02:01:44.911]  You know that when we declassify intelligence information, we do so in a means... We do so... This guy is a total weasel, and that's being mean to weasels, but again, Kennedy had to show us the missiles in Cuba.
[02:01:45.956 --> 02:01:48.297]  We had to be shown at least something, and a lot of it ended up being fake.
[02:01:48.597 --> 02:01:52.516]   We're going to come back with a bunch of false flag news straight ahead, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:01:52.516 --> 02:01:57.238]   showing you admitted false flags that Weasel Man and the AP doesn't want you to know about.
[02:01:57.238 --> 02:02:08.677]  It's hard to believe January 2022 is almost over.
[02:02:08.677 --> 02:02:12.398]  And that means our big New Year's special is about to end.
[02:02:12.488 --> 02:02:30.685]   The highest quality whole food based multivitamin and our best-selling vitamin C with zinc and rose hips formula that absolutely turbocharges your immune system are both on sale for just a few more days For 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:03:03.810 --> 02:03:16.540]  From New York City to Tokyo, Japan, robots are now on the streets ordering you to wear a face mask and scanning your vaccine passports.
[02:03:18.832 --> 02:03:22.793]  And we've got similar things happening all over the Western world.
[02:03:22.913 --> 02:03:23.533]  It is sick.
[02:03:23.553 --> 02:03:31.415]  I want to show you an article that ties into this whole CIA, State Department garbage we just saw, where, oh, we're in Alex Jones territory here.
[02:03:32.295 --> 02:03:33.736]  False flags are a real thing.
[02:03:33.776 --> 02:03:34.756]  They're a part of history.
[02:03:36.396 --> 02:03:40.177]  And the fact that the corporate media has demonized me for popularizing, and I'm on record.
[02:03:40.758 --> 02:03:46.119]  They admit I popularized the term, though it was in scholarly papers and military documents throughout history.
[02:03:46.870 --> 02:03:53.033]  And they didn't want a discussion about that, but now that it's in the lexicon, people are having debates about it.
[02:03:54.074 --> 02:04:02.398]  But Alex Jones territory is about documentation and a historical understanding into present times, and then projecting forward with a future misunderstanding.
[02:04:02.818 --> 02:04:04.699]  That's why we're tomorrow's news today.
[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:13.224]  But a really big article from Mises.org posted on Infowars.com, wokeism could provoke a global anti-American backlash.
[02:04:13.849 --> 02:04:14.950]  What have I told you for years?
[02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:33.522]  The plan is, globalism launches all the wokeism, all the pedophilia, all of it on the world, and then the world turns against America when America implodes, but the disease has already been injected out there, and then the globalists themselves don't get blamed for what they've done around the planet.
[02:04:34.143 --> 02:04:38.926]  We've been hijacked by the Club of Rome, by the Bilderberg Group, by these organizations.
[02:04:40.547 --> 02:04:47.352]  And they want us to carry out their dirty work and it be seen as America and Hollywood that are behind all this.
[02:04:47.372 --> 02:04:48.714]  But Hollywood is not America.
[02:04:50.115 --> 02:04:52.076]  And so there's a big understanding of this taking place.
[02:04:52.496 --> 02:04:53.137]  And it's important.
[02:04:53.437 --> 02:04:57.961]  People like this CIA operative up there gaslighting everybody.
[02:04:58.241 --> 02:05:00.523]  He doesn't represent America.
[02:05:02.164 --> 02:05:03.125]  So here's some of the headlines.
[02:05:03.225 --> 02:05:08.409]  Alex Jones territory reporter battles State Department spokesman on Russia false flag claim.
[02:05:10.205 --> 02:05:16.151]  Veteran reporter tears in the State Department spook over Russia false flag allegation.
[02:05:16.472 --> 02:05:17.473]  You have no evidence.
[02:05:18.934 --> 02:05:20.516]  Well, does Alex Jones have evidence?
[02:05:21.517 --> 02:05:24.880]  When he talks about things, here's a history article.
[02:05:25.301 --> 02:05:28.364]  How a false flag sparked World War II, the Glywoods incident.
[02:05:29.264 --> 02:05:40.349]  Where the Nazis attacked their own radio station, dressed up some concentration camp victims as German and Polish soldiers, shot them for the newsreels, and then put it on the newsreels so they could have an excuse to invade Poland.
[02:05:40.369 --> 02:05:41.829]  That's how World War II started in Europe.
[02:05:44.610 --> 02:05:45.251]  Let's continue.
[02:05:45.271 --> 02:05:46.371]  We'll go back to Northwoods in a minute.
[02:05:46.931 --> 02:05:50.973]  Here's the Glywots Incident on your precious Wikipedia for anybody that wants to see it.
[02:05:51.013 --> 02:05:53.094]  So show that to the Associated Press writer.
[02:05:54.668 --> 02:05:58.510]  This week in history, Nazi staged fake attack at the start of World War II.
[02:05:58.590 --> 02:05:59.450]  Desert.com.
[02:06:00.911 --> 02:06:02.251]  What was Operation Ajax?
[02:06:02.311 --> 02:06:12.175]  CIA staged, in 1953, the overthrow of Mohammed Mosaddegh by blowing up mosques and buildings and blaming it on the government.
[02:06:12.455 --> 02:06:13.115]  Declassified.
[02:06:13.416 --> 02:06:16.677]  Herman Roosevelt, grandson of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, carried that out.
[02:06:17.937 --> 02:06:20.639]  He gave NPR interviews before he died bragging about it.
[02:06:20.719 --> 02:06:23.260]  The Gulf of Tonkin incident, they've now declassified in 2004.
[02:06:26.116 --> 02:06:35.779]  From 1964, the audio tapes of LBJ from his Texas ranch talking to McNamara of the Defense Department about how they were going to stage an attack later in that day against U.S.
[02:06:35.839 --> 02:06:39.601]  aircraft carriers to blame it on the North Vietnamese as a pretext to launch the war.
[02:06:40.601 --> 02:06:43.162]  You can look that up yourself, totally declassified.
[02:06:44.002 --> 02:06:50.084]  Oh, see, the White House Globalist New World Order arm doesn't show any proof of a Russian false flag.
[02:06:50.524 --> 02:06:52.565]  I show you history that false flags exist.
[02:06:52.925 --> 02:06:53.645]  That's why I'm back.
[02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:56.101]  ForeignPolicy.com.
[02:06:56.661 --> 02:06:59.402]  That's the folks over at the CFR and the Washington Post.
[02:06:59.582 --> 02:07:02.784]  64 years later, CIA finally releases the tales of Iranian coup.
[02:07:03.244 --> 02:07:04.245]  Operation Ajax.
[02:07:06.066 --> 02:07:09.728]  It's all right there for you, ladies and gentlemen, but they don't want you to look at it.
[02:07:09.748 --> 02:07:10.308]  Here's the U.S.
[02:07:10.348 --> 02:07:10.668]  example.
[02:07:11.108 --> 02:07:12.169]  Operation Northwoods.
[02:07:12.945 --> 02:07:13.005]  L.L.
[02:07:13.105 --> 02:07:17.128]  Lemnitzer, Curtis LeMay, on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, brought in the plan to bomb U.S.
[02:07:17.168 --> 02:07:18.769]  movie theaters, shoot up U.S.
[02:07:18.789 --> 02:07:20.050]  streets, attack U.S.
[02:07:20.070 --> 02:07:24.973]  military bases to blame it on Cuba, and as a pretext of war, for war with the Soviet Union.
[02:07:27.235 --> 02:07:29.856]  You can go find it on the National Archives for yourself.
[02:07:29.896 --> 02:07:30.497]  Here's a photo.
[02:07:31.017 --> 02:07:34.699]  Operation Northwoods with Kennedy and with L.L.
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:35.280]  Lemnitzer.
[02:07:35.894 --> 02:07:41.536]  Now, his brother of all people, as Attorney General, did work with the Pentagon to stage a Central American false flag for a coup.
[02:07:41.836 --> 02:07:42.616]  They blew up the U.S.
[02:07:42.656 --> 02:07:42.997]  Embassy.
[02:07:43.397 --> 02:07:44.977]  That's declassified, been on PBS.
[02:07:45.537 --> 02:07:49.719]  But again, that's what the grown-up table talks about, you see, at the State Department.
[02:07:49.999 --> 02:07:52.180]  You're the little kids over at the little kid table.
[02:07:52.580 --> 02:07:56.941]  You're not supposed to know about the big boy table and what they're openly doing over there.
[02:07:58.522 --> 02:08:04.044]  I love the America that believes in the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, a human liberty, and a connection to God.
[02:08:04.813 --> 02:08:06.695]  Private property, you name it, right to self-defense.
[02:08:07.856 --> 02:08:10.358]  The people that have hijacked our country are the opposite of that.
[02:08:10.739 --> 02:08:17.625]  They're parasites that are running our nation under the ground, that have been propagandizing us and brain-damaging us and trying to keep us in a tiny box.
[02:08:18.396 --> 02:08:20.837]  So we're not aware of the enemy we face.
[02:08:21.217 --> 02:08:24.898]  Now, we got a big special guest host about to take over.
[02:08:25.138 --> 02:08:27.199]  Very excited to listen to this in the fourth hour.
[02:08:27.219 --> 02:08:31.160]  It's a bestselling author and researcher, and I couldn't have made Reset Wars without him.
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:33.541]  He's got a bunch of big topics to cover.
[02:08:33.981 --> 02:08:36.001]  Jake Ducey is about to take over.
[02:08:36.021 --> 02:08:40.843]  But I wanted, before we end this hour, to go to him briefly to hear about some of what he's about to lay out the next hour.
[02:08:40.863 --> 02:08:56.052]   But first, get his take on this statement here that The biggest story in the country yesterday, literally, Alex Jones territory, the whole media turning against Biden saying we don't want war with Russia and saying you have no proof you're Alex Jones.
[02:08:56.512 --> 02:08:57.334]  I have the proof.
[02:08:57.774 --> 02:08:59.517]  I say study any big event.
[02:08:59.797 --> 02:09:01.439]  A lot of times it's staged or provocateur.
[02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:04.602]  I'm not the White House not giving evidence.
[02:09:04.742 --> 02:09:08.304]  I'm the opposite giving evidence and continuing to control the paradigm.
[02:09:08.645 --> 02:09:15.229]  This is just we're inside their heads Jake and that's what Reset Wars does is help us get inside our heads to get them out of our heads.
[02:09:15.669 --> 02:09:16.170]  Jake Ducey.
[02:09:17.471 --> 02:09:19.072]  Hey Alex, it's good to see you.
[02:09:20.473 --> 02:09:32.303]   I just wanted to first say just a couple minutes ago I found out that Really a guy that changed my life, my mentor, and I excuse my emotions.
[02:09:32.383 --> 02:09:37.147]  I just found out that he passed away about two minutes ago.
[02:09:37.907 --> 02:09:38.728]  Sorry to hear that, man.
[02:09:39.608 --> 02:09:40.649]  Did he come back to you?
[02:09:42.671 --> 02:09:44.172]  You know, I'm good.
[02:09:44.232 --> 02:09:53.168]   You know, I think that when we think about reset wars and we think about everything happening in the world, This individual's name is Bob Proctor.
[02:09:53.188 --> 02:10:15.657]   He really changed my life and the reason he changed my life and you know the message that we're hoping to get across with Reset Wars is that we create our reality and we control our reality and that the system doesn't and that What they want us to do, there's two forms of consciousness.
[02:10:15.697 --> 02:10:20.061]  There's a creation form of consciousness and a reaction form of consciousness, right?
[02:10:20.081 --> 02:10:22.624]  And you were mentioning that viral clip.
[02:10:23.488 --> 02:10:29.251]  Where they were being interrogated and what they want us to do is stay in this reaction consciousness, right?
[02:10:29.431 --> 02:10:36.656]  And an example of that with that viral clip was he just wanted everyone to just react and accept it.
[02:10:36.816 --> 02:10:37.696]  Oh my gosh, Russia.
[02:10:37.836 --> 02:10:38.737]  Oh my gosh, Russia.
[02:10:38.877 --> 02:10:39.377]  Oh my gosh.
[02:10:39.457 --> 02:10:39.677]  Okay.
[02:10:39.717 --> 02:10:40.017]  Okay.
[02:10:40.118 --> 02:10:42.359]  And stay in a reaction state of consciousness.
[02:10:43.463 --> 02:10:57.567]  And I believe that the solutions to our problems are found in something I learned from my mentor, Bob Proctor, which is that human beings are the only creatures on Earth with the ability to create their own environment.
[02:10:57.927 --> 02:11:03.029]  And we can use creativity or we can use reaction consciousness.
[02:11:03.049 --> 02:11:06.150]  And by the way, this is crazy because Bob Proctor is the trailblazer.
[02:11:06.710 --> 02:11:10.751]  Yeah, and I know you would laugh at me being emotional because Bob always says, you're a spiritual being in a physical body.
[02:11:10.570 --> 02:11:13.371]  He literally just died today in the last few hours.
[02:11:13.371 --> 02:11:15.570]  It's just now breaking in the news this minute.
[02:11:15.570 --> 02:11:17.671]  And you told me what a big mentor he was for you.
[02:11:17.671 --> 02:11:22.350]  So it's just wild that he just went to the next level today.
[02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:27.810]   Yeah, and I know you would laugh at me being emotional because Bob always says,
[02:11:27.810 --> 02:11:30.171]  "You're a spiritual being in a physical body."
[02:11:30.171 --> 02:11:38.131]   And one of the reasons that I think his work is so powerful is because what the whole system is designed
[02:11:38.131 --> 02:11:40.730]  us trapped in our physical self.
[02:11:40.890 --> 02:11:50.814]  It's to make us believe we're just a physical body because when we're just a physical body They can manipulate us through the reptilian centers of our brain and through the fear complexes.
[02:11:50.854 --> 02:12:06.670]   This is what traps us in a lower electromagnetic states and this is how they use manipulation and fear and So I and for everyone listening, please excuse me, you know for a little bit of those A little bit of those feelings.
[02:12:08.371 --> 02:12:12.611]  Hold on, you're going to take over in a minute, but I want you to talk about Bob Proctor, because I've read some of his work.
[02:12:12.971 --> 02:12:26.494]  Great guy, and he's just dialing into what we already innately know, but doing a great job organizing and getting people to realize that, and not letting the globalists say, you're a loser, you're a failure, it's all over, you're going to die, we're not going to make it, humans are dirty, post-human world, looking forward to the end of humanity.
[02:12:26.834 --> 02:12:34.395]  No, we're beautiful, we're amazing, we're made in the image of God, and by accepting God in our lives, he helps us transcend our sin and our fallen nature and takes us to the next level.
[02:12:35.382 --> 02:12:40.825]  Jake Ducey is about to take over in the fourth hour today to talk about ResetWars.com.
[02:12:41.265 --> 02:12:45.187]  And I should also add to all the viewers and listeners, they've been trying to censor, they've been trying to block it.
[02:12:45.447 --> 02:12:48.148]  It's a great course and it funds the InfoWar.
[02:12:48.448 --> 02:12:49.809]  A 360 win and only we failed.
[02:12:50.758 --> 02:12:51.539]  You don't take action.
[02:12:51.899 --> 02:12:52.480]  It's 50% off.
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:13:00.028]  Today was going to be the last day, but in memory of Bob Proctor, we're going to extend it through Sunday and then that's it because we got to fund a bunch of stuff with this and build a big infrastructure.
[02:13:00.388 --> 02:13:01.789]  So again, a lot's coming out of this.
[02:13:01.829 --> 02:13:03.771]  Thanks for being right on the front lines, folks.
[02:13:03.811 --> 02:13:05.253]  Thank you all that signed up for it.
[02:13:05.573 --> 02:13:07.535]  If you've been on the fence and have it, go get it today.
[02:13:07.795 --> 02:13:08.916]  Be part of this special event.
[02:13:09.417 --> 02:13:10.538]  ResetWars.com.
[02:13:10.558 --> 02:13:10.838]  50% off.
[02:13:10.858 --> 02:13:11.299]  Stay with us.
[02:13:14.116 --> 02:13:14.676]  Hello, everybody.
[02:13:14.696 --> 02:13:18.338]  I want to welcome you back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:18.498 --> 02:13:28.083]  My name is Jake Ducey and I apologize for a little bit of my emotion there earlier.
[02:13:28.103 --> 02:13:32.806]  I just found out that probably more so than anyone that's really ever lived.
[02:13:33.976 --> 02:13:35.357]  God, that really changed my life.
[02:13:35.798 --> 02:13:44.965]  And I want to talk a little bit about some of the things that I learned that I think can really help us defeat this agenda that we're facing here.
[02:13:46.567 --> 02:14:10.261]   And in order to kind of illustrate this power of the human spirit that, first of all, they don't want us to tap into, and second of all, the thing that they fear the most, In order to illustrate that, I just wanted to play a quick video that really touched me that I'm not sure if you've all seen yet or that Alex played earlier.
[02:14:11.021 --> 02:14:21.650]  So if we could roll that clip at Washougal High School here of the very, very amazing kid that, if I was his parent, I would be incredibly proud of.
[02:14:21.710 --> 02:14:28.616]  So if we've got that clip, guys, we can go ahead and we can roll that here to start off today.
[02:14:29.991 --> 02:14:31.313]  Everybody shut up!
[02:14:34.275 --> 02:14:38.959]  This is not an excuse for any of you freshmen and sophomores to disrespect your teachers.
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:46.606]  If I hear of anybody disrespecting teachers or staff tomorrow, that makes us look bad.
[02:14:48.127 --> 02:14:50.909]  We want this to be a peaceful, respectful movement.
[02:14:50.949 --> 02:14:53.972]  We are just trying to gain back our rights as citizens.
[02:14:55.731 --> 02:15:00.173]  We do not care about... The teachers in the end are just doing their jobs.
[02:15:00.693 --> 02:15:01.794]  It doesn't come from them.
[02:15:03.155 --> 02:15:04.395]  It comes from the state.
[02:15:06.016 --> 02:15:09.318]  Now, what we're hoping is that they kick us out.
[02:15:09.498 --> 02:15:11.799]  This sounds bad, but we're hoping that they kick us out.
[02:15:12.359 --> 02:15:14.520]  Because they have to report that attendance to the state.
[02:15:15.241 --> 02:15:23.325]  And if the state sees a day where 100 or I don't even know how many kids are here, are absent, they're going to start asking questions.
[02:15:24.491 --> 02:15:26.493]  Our hope is, is we can get this statewide.
[02:15:28.354 --> 02:15:31.817]  Now I might get in trouble for this, but the plan still stands for Wednesday.
[02:15:32.377 --> 02:15:33.198]  For tomorrow, I mean.
[02:15:34.659 --> 02:15:40.343]  Everybody is gonna meet at the back row of the senior parking lot, and we're all walking into the school with no mask on.
[02:15:42.204 --> 02:15:44.726]  You can get me in trouble, they can suspend me, I don't care.
[02:15:44.987 --> 02:15:45.787]  We're done with this.
[02:15:46.708 --> 02:15:48.269]  And obviously all of you are too.
[02:15:48.289 --> 02:15:49.730]  Shut up.
[02:15:50.231 --> 02:15:50.551]  Shut up!
[02:15:52.350 --> 02:15:54.512]  Obviously all you are are done with the mask too.
[02:15:57.033 --> 02:15:59.815]  Now again, we're doing this peacefully and respectfully.
[02:15:59.875 --> 02:16:05.219]  If a staff member asks you to put a mask on, you say no thank you and keep walking.
[02:16:05.839 --> 02:16:07.921]  And if they kick you out, then go home.
[02:16:09.201 --> 02:16:14.565]  And if people need rides home, then some of the seniors, I'm sure we can start giving people rides home.
[02:16:15.846 --> 02:16:17.067]  That's about it.
[02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:32.031]  So the reason that I love that video, I found it very touching, is because I think it's the perfect example of, look, we're all upset about what's happening in the world.
[02:16:32.071 --> 02:16:33.853]  We don't like what's happening in the world.
[02:16:33.933 --> 02:16:42.604]   If you watch InfoWars, You know how bad things are getting and it's very easy to get angry and it's very easy to get upset.
[02:16:43.184 --> 02:16:44.364]  But that's what they want us to do.
[02:16:44.405 --> 02:16:47.366]  They want us to move into a victim state of consciousness.
[02:16:47.986 --> 02:16:51.907]  And what Bob Proctor taught me is that there's only two forms of consciousness.
[02:16:51.947 --> 02:16:56.829]  There's a creation form of consciousness and there's a reaction form of consciousness.
[02:16:57.729 --> 02:17:01.957]   And they want us to be asking Well, how bad is this?
[02:17:02.257 --> 02:17:03.438]  How bad is this going to get?
[02:17:03.558 --> 02:17:04.579]  Why are they so bad?
[02:17:04.679 --> 02:17:05.840]  Why are they so evil?
[02:17:06.220 --> 02:17:07.661]  They want us to be angry.
[02:17:07.741 --> 02:17:09.362]  They don't care if we know what's happening.
[02:17:09.402 --> 02:17:10.923]  They just want us to stay angry.
[02:17:11.584 --> 02:17:20.652]   And my question that I want to pose to you is, how can you take The energy of anger, the energy of depression and the energy of despair that you may feel.
[02:17:21.212 --> 02:17:25.937]  And how can you creatively transmute that energy into doing something powerful?
[02:17:25.997 --> 02:17:32.323]  Because you were given, God given, not only rights, but you're made in the image of God.
[02:17:32.363 --> 02:17:36.868]  The creative force of the universe is literally moving through you at any single second.
[02:17:37.555 --> 02:17:41.736]  And the question is, how can we turn this energy into powerful forces?
[02:17:42.197 --> 02:17:45.057]  And we're going to be talking about that for the rest of the show here today.
[02:17:45.478 --> 02:17:47.278]  I'm on in honor of Reset Wars.
[02:17:47.598 --> 02:17:51.319]  It's a 50% off censorship special going on right now.
[02:17:51.780 --> 02:18:00.482]  That's ResetWars.com, where you can join the movement, which is about moving out of our anger and our victimhood, transforming our minds and changing our world.
[02:18:00.522 --> 02:18:01.623]  That's ResetWars.com.
[02:18:03.773 --> 02:18:07.175]  So I want to welcome you back to the Alex Jones Show here in the fourth hour.
[02:18:07.235 --> 02:18:13.998]  My name is Jake Ducey and I'm filling in in honor of the 50% off Reset Wars special at ResetWars.com.
[02:18:14.018 --> 02:18:16.579]  So I want to thank you for being involved in that.
[02:18:17.199 --> 02:18:24.443]  And I want to talk a little bit about what I learned from my mentor, Bob Proctor, that really changed my life.
[02:18:25.443 --> 02:18:30.906]  And I was aware of all of these things that were happening in the world.
[02:18:31.744 --> 02:18:37.030]  But if I looked in the mirror, I was angry, I was depressed, and I wasn't doing anything about it.
[02:18:37.590 --> 02:18:40.193]  And Bob posed a question to me.
[02:18:40.733 --> 02:18:44.337]  He said, does your thinking create your reality?
[02:18:44.798 --> 02:18:46.579]  Or is the world creating your reality?
[02:18:47.260 --> 02:18:49.002]  Does your thinking create your reality?
[02:18:49.242 --> 02:18:50.904]  Or is the world controlling your thinking?
[02:18:51.841 --> 02:19:01.686]  And in Alex's course, Reset Wars, one of the things that I really love about it is a section where he talks about, are you a victim to the New World Order?
[02:19:01.746 --> 02:19:03.267]  Are you a victim to the regime?
[02:19:04.282 --> 02:19:16.149]  And the way that they've set the system up is to keep us in a state of anger so that we're trapped in the reptilian center of our brain, which traps us into lower states of consciousness.
[02:19:16.669 --> 02:19:21.773]  And when we're trapped in lower states of consciousness, we remain in a reactive state only.
[02:19:22.113 --> 02:19:23.474]  We can only react.
[02:19:23.554 --> 02:19:27.356]  We may have great knowledge of what's occurring, but we can only react to it.
[02:19:28.316 --> 02:19:32.619]  And kind of like a ton of bricks, it finally hit me that there wasn't much I was doing about it.
[02:19:33.422 --> 02:19:36.683]  I could tell you all types of declassified documents.
[02:19:36.723 --> 02:19:38.383]  I could tell you what the agenda was.
[02:19:38.443 --> 02:19:40.464]  I could tell you what was coming down the pipeline.
[02:19:40.904 --> 02:19:43.465]  I could recite everything that was happening in the world.
[02:19:43.985 --> 02:19:45.585]  But I wasn't doing anything about it.
[02:19:46.346 --> 02:19:47.306]  I really wasn't.
[02:19:48.186 --> 02:19:52.047]  I like to think I was because I had a lot of knowledge of what was occurring.
[02:19:53.067 --> 02:19:58.489]  And I realized that I had become a victim to the New World Order.
[02:19:59.309 --> 02:20:00.469]  I'd become a victim to it.
[02:20:00.949 --> 02:20:02.570]  I thought that I couldn't get ahead in life.
[02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:07.911]  I thought there was nothing really to find that much joy in because X, Y, and Z things were happening.
[02:20:08.531 --> 02:20:10.152]  And I want to pose this question to you.
[02:20:11.832 --> 02:20:17.914]  Does your thinking create your reality or has the regime controlled your thinking?
[02:20:19.063 --> 02:20:25.569]  And one of the things that Bob Proctor talks about is the ability to accept or reject any idea, right?
[02:20:25.609 --> 02:20:30.614]  There's something called our conscious mind and our conscious minds responsible for 5% of our life.
[02:20:31.134 --> 02:20:38.961]  The majority of our life is a subconscious habitual thought pattern that is controlled by a reactionary animalistic state of consciousness.
[02:20:39.502 --> 02:20:49.533]   And the entire goal is to In a sense, disorient our conscious mind so that we accept the will that is given to us.
[02:20:50.194 --> 02:20:56.156]  So we accept the will or we accept the regime or we accept the agenda that is being laid down.
[02:20:57.157 --> 02:21:00.198]  And I want to pose a question to you.
[02:21:00.898 --> 02:21:06.921]  And that question is, have you discovered what you're really capable of as a human being?
[02:21:08.061 --> 02:21:11.723]  Have you discovered what you're really capable of as a human being?
[02:21:13.303 --> 02:21:18.705]  And it's one thing to have all of these knowledges about everything that's taking place in this world.
[02:21:18.785 --> 02:21:25.948]  And I believe it's another thing to ask ourselves this question of what creative utility can I provide to the world?
[02:21:26.808 --> 02:21:54.267]   And the reason that I've come on the show and I've been, you know, relentlessly promoting Reset Wars is quite frankly, because I believe that the way the world changes And I believe it can change is when we wake up, not to our power, just to find out what's going on, not just to our power of getting upset and protesting.
[02:21:54.688 --> 02:22:05.076]  But when we realize what Buckminster Fuller once said so eloquently, and I'm paraphrasing here, he said that in order to change the system, you don't fight it.
[02:22:05.176 --> 02:22:07.658]  You build a new one that makes the old one obsolete.
[02:22:08.218 --> 02:22:09.299]  And I believe that.
[02:22:10.083 --> 02:22:18.449]  We're spiritual beings in a physical body, and God is always speaking to us and moving through us if we're ready to answer that call.
[02:22:19.310 --> 02:22:26.315]  And my question to you is, what place in this incredible moment in history do you have?
[02:22:27.656 --> 02:22:29.657]  Is it to rebuild the education system?
[02:22:30.118 --> 02:22:32.039]  Is it to build new media platforms?
[02:22:32.399 --> 02:22:34.481]  Is it to build a new social media company?
[02:22:35.261 --> 02:22:38.904]  And you might say, well, I don't know how to do it, or I don't have the resources to do it.
[02:22:39.953 --> 02:22:44.074]  And I want to challenge any thinking that may come up there.
[02:22:44.154 --> 02:22:47.715]  You may think you're too old, you're too young, you're in the wrong spot, you're too busy.
[02:22:48.375 --> 02:23:04.320]  Because I believe that when you have a vision, when you are inspired by some great purpose, by some extraordinary bonds, all of your perceived limitations break apart and you find yourself to be a more powerful individual than you ever thought possible.
[02:23:06.340 --> 02:23:09.003]  The question is, what is your place?
[02:23:09.583 --> 02:23:10.624]  What is your purpose?
[02:23:12.146 --> 02:23:15.209]  And I'm willing to bet deep down.
[02:23:15.985 --> 02:23:18.666]  You know that there's something big that you're meant for.
[02:23:19.286 --> 02:23:31.990]  And the way that we start to change this world is when all of us, instead of just watching InfoWars, instead of just telling everyone what's happening in the world, it's when you create something meaningful.
[02:23:32.330 --> 02:23:39.132]  When you and I all come to an inspired place and we tap into that higher level of spiritual energy.
[02:23:39.732 --> 02:23:41.853]  Not the lower level that makes us angry.
[02:23:42.253 --> 02:23:43.213]  We transmute it.
[02:23:43.853 --> 02:23:48.817]  Alex talks a lot in Reset Wars about the various laws of the universe and about quantum physics.
[02:23:48.857 --> 02:23:51.959]  And he talks about how energy is never created or destroyed.
[02:23:52.499 --> 02:23:54.641]  It can only be transferred to different states.
[02:23:55.281 --> 02:23:58.744]  And what we're talking about here is the transmutation of energy.
[02:23:59.104 --> 02:24:06.549]  From anger, from despair, from helplessness, from I can't believe what Bill Gates is doing, I can't believe what the regime is doing.
[02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:08.251]  And we reverse that.
[02:24:08.751 --> 02:24:12.974]  And we say, I'm going to take all of that energy and build something meaningful.
[02:24:13.354 --> 02:24:21.379]  And I'm challenging you to take that energy and take that anger and build something great today.
[02:24:22.019 --> 02:24:33.505]  Whatever it is, rebuilding the education system, writing a book, building meaningful music, teaching kids, building a new school, whatever it is that might be for you.
[02:24:33.665 --> 02:24:46.948]   One of the things that I learned from Bob Proctor was to take whatever it was that my vision was, And I'm pulling it off my computer here and write it on a piece of paper and carry that index card with you everywhere that you go.
[02:24:47.428 --> 02:25:03.532]  Because the fact is, not only is all of these crazy things occurring in the world, but outside of all of these crazy things that are occurring in the world, at some point, you and I are going to have to face who we've been in this life.
[02:25:04.597 --> 02:25:07.858]  And we're going to have to face God, and we're going to have to face the universe.
[02:25:08.539 --> 02:25:11.440]  Not in a fear-based way of, are we going to be punished?
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:14.921]  But in a way of, did you make the most of it?
[02:25:16.302 --> 02:25:22.525]  We're alive in the greatest time in human history, with the most tools, with the best technology that we've ever had.
[02:25:23.045 --> 02:25:24.345]  And there are a lot of problems.
[02:25:25.426 --> 02:25:27.767]  But there's a lot of great things that we can do about it.
[02:25:28.924 --> 02:25:39.306]  We all have access to the same universal mind that Einstein had access to, that Elon Musk has access to, that anyone that you're admired by, Alex Jones has access to.
[02:25:39.726 --> 02:25:42.126]  We can all tap into that unconscious level.
[02:25:42.707 --> 02:25:49.648]  But what happens is, we've been conditioned through a self-image to believe that the other people have the power.
[02:25:50.148 --> 02:26:02.469]   Whether it's Joe Rogan, whether it's Alex Jones, whether it's Owen, whether it's Paul Watson, We've been conditioned to believe that we cannot be the one.
[02:26:04.471 --> 02:26:14.101]  And not only have I found that to be an incredibly incorrect statement, but I've found that the focus is entirely shifted in the wrong direction.
[02:26:14.882 --> 02:26:28.879]   And I think that When we can start to find significant purpose and significant meaning in something we can do every single solitary day to make the world a better place.
[02:26:29.019 --> 02:26:35.403]  And for me, I thought the only thing I could do was just study how bad things were and to study what was wrong.
[02:26:36.364 --> 02:26:40.847]  And I started to reverse engineer that and I said, what is a problem I could solve?
[02:26:42.588 --> 02:26:44.049]  What is a problem I could solve?
[02:26:44.835 --> 02:26:48.597]  And my question that I want to pose to that is you, is what is a problem you can solve?
[02:26:49.078 --> 02:26:56.662]  And what I invite you to do here as we head into a break in just a moment, is to pull out a pen and pad and write out what problem you can solve.
[02:26:57.023 --> 02:26:57.963]  Write out a goal.
[02:26:58.203 --> 02:27:00.485]  Bob Proctor talks about three types of goals.
[02:27:00.925 --> 02:27:03.006]  An A-type goal is a goal you know how to do.
[02:27:03.527 --> 02:27:05.928]  A B-type goal is a goal you think you know how to do.
[02:27:06.008 --> 02:27:08.309]  Based off your current thing, I think I could probably do that.
[02:27:08.810 --> 02:27:12.132]  And a C-type goal is a goal you have no idea how to do.
[02:27:12.772 --> 02:27:15.693]  It's going to take an entire new paradigm.
[02:27:16.014 --> 02:27:24.657]  It's going to take the power of God to uplift you once you have the courage to face that big vision, that big fear, even if you're afraid.
[02:27:25.058 --> 02:27:33.381]  And I'm inviting you to look within yourself and call upon God for a C-type goal, a C-type goal that can build something beautiful, right?
[02:27:33.401 --> 02:27:34.922]  They talk about building back better.
[02:27:35.342 --> 02:27:39.026]  What about building something beautiful and building something meaningful?
[02:27:39.086 --> 02:27:43.991]  And I'm really proud of Alex and I'm proud to have been involved in Reset Wars because that's a plan to do that.
[02:27:44.471 --> 02:27:45.953]  It's ResetWars.com.
[02:27:46.033 --> 02:27:48.876]  It's a 50% off censorship special right now.

[02:27:57.624 --> 02:27:59.105]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:59.165 --> 02:28:05.950]  My name is Jake Ducey and I'm here in honor of the Reset Wars 50% off special that's going on right now.
[02:28:06.310 --> 02:28:18.378]  Alex's first ever online course that breaks down exactly what they don't want you to know, how to prepare for the Great Reset, and more importantly, how to transmute all of this energy that we're facing.
[02:28:18.498 --> 02:28:23.722]  These psychological warfare, spiritual warfare, the anger, all these rightful feelings that we have.
[02:28:24.122 --> 02:28:29.684]  How do we transmute that so that we can make a dent in the universe in a meaningful and significant way?
[02:28:30.144 --> 02:28:31.685]  That's at ResetWords.com.
[02:28:31.725 --> 02:28:35.246]  It's a 50% off special right now, so you can go ahead and check that out.
[02:28:35.826 --> 02:28:40.267]  And let's talk a little bit about what they don't want us to know.
[02:28:40.468 --> 02:28:41.988]  What do they actually fear?
[02:28:42.508 --> 02:28:48.610]  Now that people are waking up to the agenda, do they fear us just knowing about the agenda?
[02:28:49.331 --> 02:28:50.651]  Or is there something deeper?
[02:28:51.432 --> 02:28:54.013]  And I would argue that there's something deeper to it.
[02:28:54.993 --> 02:28:58.434]  And it's the hidden knowledge that's always been there.
[02:28:59.235 --> 02:29:01.015]  But the books have been burned.
[02:29:02.596 --> 02:29:06.377]  The secret libraries have been moved underground.
[02:29:07.798 --> 02:29:11.679]  And that question is, what do they not want us to know?
[02:29:12.319 --> 02:29:20.422]  And I think in order to answer that question, we have to ask ourselves maybe a more significant question.
[02:29:21.342 --> 02:29:24.631]  And that question might be, who are you really?
[02:29:25.573 --> 02:29:26.897]  And what are you capable of?
[02:29:28.215 --> 02:29:37.917]  And just right before we went live on air, I found out that one of my best friends and my mentor, Bob Proctor, he just passed away.
[02:29:38.397 --> 02:29:42.478]  And I know he would laugh at my feelings.
[02:29:43.098 --> 02:29:53.100]  And I'm not sure if it's because I'm sad that he passed away or if it's just that I'm overwhelmed with everything I've learned from this individual and how he's changed my life.
[02:29:54.120 --> 02:30:00.670]   And one of the things that they don't want us to know, Is the real power of consciousness.
[02:30:01.430 --> 02:30:17.734]  We're seeing now that governments are even starting to talk about the power of vitamin D. And I have to laugh at that because not because, yeah, vitamin D, they've shown all the studies that people that are most susceptible to illness and death are people that have low vitamin D levels.
[02:30:18.154 --> 02:30:22.255]  But more importantly, I think it's because it's incredibly elementary.
[02:30:24.449 --> 02:30:31.856]  The best way to protect our immune system, and more importantly, the best way to defeat this agenda, is to recognize the power of human consciousness.
[02:30:32.603 --> 02:30:43.069]  You know, there's a few terms in science that, for whatever reason, they have not made it into the scientific textbooks that we're studying in schools and colleges.
[02:30:43.610 --> 02:30:45.731]  And a couple of those terms are epigenetics.
[02:30:46.291 --> 02:30:49.733]  We know about placebo, but what about nocebo effect?
[02:30:50.174 --> 02:30:55.097]  The placebo effect, of course, and forgive me, I know you know about the placebo.
[02:30:55.797 --> 02:31:00.420]  A placebo, right, is take a sugar pill and you may think it's real.
[02:31:01.608 --> 02:31:11.095]  And due to the power of consciousness, you can evoke a response through your nervous system, through your cells, and through your immune system.
[02:31:11.695 --> 02:31:19.340]  Now, the nocebo effect, Dr. Joe Dispenza has read at length about this in his book called You Are the Placebo.
[02:31:20.101 --> 02:31:22.403]  Not the placebo effect, but you are the placebo.
[02:31:22.923 --> 02:31:40.063]   Now, the nocebo effect is consciousness that you and I hold also Has the same ability to affect us negatively on a cellular level, or more importantly, because cells are just energy and you and I are just a field of energy.
[02:31:40.083 --> 02:31:45.205]  It looks like my body ends right here, but it really extends, you know, maybe another five, six, seven feet.
[02:31:45.625 --> 02:31:46.206]  I'm a feet.
[02:31:46.246 --> 02:31:50.247]  I'm on an electromagnetic field of energy and you are an electromagnetic field of energy.
[02:31:50.887 --> 02:32:05.454]   And the nocebo effect is about how Negative consciousness or negative assumptions about reality can not only make you sick, but they can actually kill you.
[02:32:06.434 --> 02:32:19.982]  And if we bring it back to what we were talking about earlier in Reset Wars, one of the parts of Alex's course that I love so much is he breaks down a section about, are you a victim to the New World Order?
[02:32:20.422 --> 02:32:31.171]   And he says, you know, you may be awake, you may know everything that's happening in the world, He may be one of the most brilliant individuals that can explain exactly what's occurring in the world.
[02:32:32.451 --> 02:32:35.132]  But that doesn't mean that we aren't victims to the New World Order.
[02:32:35.753 --> 02:32:45.037]  And that's why the famous quote is said so often that knowledge isn't power, it's the application of that knowledge that becomes power.
[02:32:45.677 --> 02:32:49.939]  And so the question is, what are we going to do with these things that we know?
[02:32:50.339 --> 02:32:52.300]  And what are we going to do with these things that we learned?
[02:32:53.030 --> 02:33:04.038]  And I think as we move deeper into that, and we move into the Nocebo Effect, we can see how the negative images that we're holding, all of reality is a projection of images and a projection of consciousness.
[02:33:04.498 --> 02:33:06.280]  If I say, think of your refrigerator.
[02:33:07.841 --> 02:33:12.905]  You can close your eyes, and in a second, the image flashes onto the screen of your mind.
[02:33:13.525 --> 02:33:15.186]  Your refrigerator might be silver.
[02:33:15.567 --> 02:33:17.388]  Or you say, what's your car look like?
[02:33:17.548 --> 02:33:19.930]  And immediately you see a white four-door SUV.
[02:33:20.908 --> 02:33:21.769]  We think in images.
[02:33:22.930 --> 02:33:24.651]  95% of our life is subconscious.
[02:33:24.671 --> 02:33:28.454]  So 95% of those images are held subconsciously.
[02:33:28.994 --> 02:33:38.501]  And those subconscious images, because the ruling elites know this, are designed to reinforce a image of a negative future.
[02:33:38.521 --> 02:33:46.705]   And this image of a negative future, I would propose Is also run by the nocebo effect.
[02:33:47.085 --> 02:34:01.134]  Now, we talked about the immune system where the most powerful way to strengthen your immune system is to understand that your immune system is a stress response that's based off electromagnetic stimuli that's moving through your nervous system and your brain on a subconscious level.
[02:34:01.735 --> 02:34:09.720]  But if we take a step back, the question is, are we using the nocebo effect to create our own enslavement every single day?
[02:34:10.698 --> 02:34:16.202]  And one of the things that I learned from Bob Proctor is that I have the ability to accept or reject any idea.
[02:34:16.902 --> 02:34:20.064]  I know that there's talk of a planned economic collapse.
[02:34:20.564 --> 02:34:33.913]  I know we're seeing inflation at record levels, but as Bob says, he once saw a bumper sticker on the back of a car that said, I heard there's a recession taking place and I will not participate in it.
[02:34:34.514 --> 02:34:37.736]  I heard there's a recession taking place and I will not participate in it.
[02:34:38.257 --> 02:34:44.081]  I heard there's a collapse of the middle class, an enslavement of the middle class, but I will not participate in it.
[02:34:44.901 --> 02:34:51.966]  And the conscious mind, because we're free, powerful individuals, we have the ability to accept or reject any ideas.
[02:34:52.427 --> 02:35:04.979]   And what I invite you to do is look at the assumptions that you're holding about the future and look at your assumptions that you're holding about reality and ask yourself, Is this an image?
[02:35:05.759 --> 02:35:14.623]  Given that you're made in the image of God, you're endowed with creative faculties and the ability to create your own environment, is this an image that you want to hold?
[02:35:15.563 --> 02:35:24.839]   Now, if all of us are collectively holding Negative images about how they have bought and sold all the governments.
[02:35:24.899 --> 02:35:35.167]  If we believe Klaus Schwab's Wikipedia page that Alex has talked about repeatedly, where he talks about capturing global governments, if we believe they've captured it, then they have.
[02:35:36.808 --> 02:35:37.949]  It's just the fact of the matter.
[02:35:39.010 --> 02:35:59.930]   But if we believe the opposite, if we believe that that's just a suggestion, If we understand that what they're trying to do is implant these ideas into our subconscious, let's say you're always going to be a debt slave, you have to worry about your own death, if you have to worry about your own immune system, they win.
[02:36:01.050 --> 02:36:17.824]   Now, if the nocebo effect can affect an immune system in a way that can create illness or create death, Can the nocebo effect also cause us, if all of us are holding these negative images, can it also cause us to create our own enslavement?
[02:36:18.966 --> 02:36:22.749]  And we're going to be talking about that more through the rest of today's show.
[02:36:23.630 --> 02:36:34.478]  And if you want to find out how to reprogram that, rebuild that, and become a powerful force of good in the world far beyond your wildest imaginations, I encourage you to go to ResetWars.com right now.
[02:36:34.799 --> 02:36:40.203]  There's a 50% off censorship special right now at ResetWars.com, so check it out.
[02:36:40.783 --> 02:36:43.644]  I want to welcome you back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:36:43.664 --> 02:36:49.125]  My name is Jake and I'm here in honor of the Reset Wars 50% Off Censorship Special.
[02:36:49.325 --> 02:37:05.327]  We've got five or six major attacks on Reset Wars and we're doing a 50% Off Censorship Special because quite frankly they don't want this type of information to get out there and it's not just Reset Wars.
[02:37:06.268 --> 02:37:20.986]   It's this type of information in general because They want to sustain a reactive state of consciousness where using the observer effect, the power of quantum physics, and the nocebo effect, we continue to feel powerless to what's happening.
[02:37:21.726 --> 02:37:27.308]  And the more powerless we feel, even if we're awake to what's happening, the more they win.
[02:37:28.409 --> 02:37:34.271]  And so you can go to ResetWars.com right now and check out the 50% off censorship special that's going on.
[02:37:35.054 --> 02:38:17.021]   I think it was going to close today, but Alex extended it for another day or two in honor of the passing of my mentor and one of my dear friends, Bob Proctor, who's really changed my life in an immeasurable way because he helped me realize that I have the power of free will and I have the power to harness my own consciousness and my own mind and my own behaviors and my own actions to do something meaningful in the world instead of just sit around and complain about what's happening and study it and get mad at it that I could take this energy and do something useful.
[02:38:17.779 --> 02:38:21.781]  That's the why behind Reset Wars and why it was created.
[02:38:21.961 --> 02:38:45.332]  Of course, it's very important to continue to fund these operations, but more significantly, this is about the next step in human evolution and tapping into the power that you have as an individual to do something incredibly meaningful in the limited amount of time that you're here in a body.
[02:38:46.417 --> 02:38:53.322]  And so I want to talk a little bit about quantum physics here, and I want to talk a little bit about the observer effect.
[02:38:54.343 --> 02:38:59.947]  But before we get into that, I just finished a great book called Embrace the Suck.
[02:39:00.067 --> 02:39:01.849]  It was written by a Navy SEAL.
[02:39:01.889 --> 02:39:03.990]  I'm forgetting his name right now off the top of my head.
[02:39:04.611 --> 02:39:17.946]   And I really love the phrase embrace the suck, because look, right now there's a lot of Bad things happening in the world on a global level, but you may be influenced on a personal level.
[02:39:18.067 --> 02:39:19.227]  You may have lost a job.
[02:39:19.647 --> 02:39:21.228]  You may be behind financially.
[02:39:21.368 --> 02:39:24.270]  There may be a lot more stress than you'd like to have.
[02:39:24.810 --> 02:39:36.277]  And when you're aware of what's happening in the world, there's also an increased level of subconscious tension because you want to do something about it and it can be frustrating.
[02:39:37.538 --> 02:39:44.073]   And I think a good mantra for us is to embrace the suck and do something meaningful.
[02:39:46.234 --> 02:39:51.097]  We're not going to be able to avoid the suck that happens in life.
[02:39:51.157 --> 02:39:59.042]  But the question is, are you trading your suck for building something meaningful?
[02:39:59.943 --> 02:40:01.604]  Or are you just tolerating it?
[02:40:02.144 --> 02:40:05.907]  Most people just tolerate the suck.
[02:40:07.125 --> 02:40:28.685]  Well, this is just the way it is, and you know, if the financial system wasn't such a fraud, and if they didn't declare everyone non-essential, and if this wasn't happening, I'd be happier, I'd have more financial freedom, or if X, Y, and Z wasn't occurring, I'd write that book, I'd rebuild the education system, I'd run for local office, but I can't, here's why.
[02:40:30.447 --> 02:40:36.750]  But embracing the suck, I think, is illustrated very well in Viktor Frankl's book, A Man's Search for Meaning.
[02:40:37.230 --> 02:40:55.390]   And we've all heard about that book, but one of the points that really stuck out to me is, here was this psychologist that got put in Auschwitz and many of these terrible camps, and while faced with You know, an unspeakable level of tyranny.
[02:40:56.030 --> 02:41:07.052]  What he realized was that they could do anything to him, but they could not take away his ability to think what he wanted to think.
[02:41:08.373 --> 02:41:22.385]   And he found that the people that didn't make it, that just couldn't find the will to keep going in the face of this enslavement, It was because they didn't have a connection to something larger than themselves.
[02:41:22.405 --> 02:41:23.725]  They couldn't find meaning in it.
[02:41:24.866 --> 02:41:46.071]  And what I love about Reset Wars is it's giving us the tools to not only embrace the suck, but to find significant meaning in what's happening in the world and find your place to make it brighter, to make it better, to make it more beautiful.
[02:41:47.011 --> 02:41:58.611]   And Telling everyone what's happening in the world alone isn't going to solve or fix what's occurring.
[02:41:59.592 --> 02:42:09.398]   What's going to change the world is when everyone around you sees that you've woken up And you're changing your financial life.
[02:42:09.439 --> 02:42:11.359]  You've doubled your sales in your business.
[02:42:11.779 --> 02:42:13.700]  You've started to build that nonprofit.
[02:42:13.740 --> 02:42:16.680]  You've started to rebuild the education system.
[02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:21.281]  You had an idea, but you don't know how to code, so you taught yourself how to code.
[02:42:21.942 --> 02:42:25.983]  Whatever it is, this is the keys to our own freedoms.
[02:42:27.343 --> 02:42:33.789]   Now, one of the questions that I posed earlier is, What really is the hidden knowledge?
[02:42:34.169 --> 02:42:37.592]  And the hidden knowledge comes back to a question is, who are you really?
[02:42:38.292 --> 02:42:45.817]  And as Bob Proctor always said, who you are isn't your name and it's not who you see in the mirror.
[02:42:46.358 --> 02:42:48.799]  And there's a point in my life when someone said, who are you?
[02:42:48.819 --> 02:42:50.921]  I would say, well, I'm Jake Ducey.
[02:42:51.241 --> 02:42:52.101]  Here's who I am.
[02:42:52.121 --> 02:42:52.982]  I have blue eyes.
[02:42:53.002 --> 02:42:54.103]  I'm about this tall.
[02:42:54.463 --> 02:42:55.404]  This is who I am.
[02:42:56.144 --> 02:42:57.265]  But that's not who I am.
[02:42:58.806 --> 02:43:14.933]  The physical body is just a rental car that houses your soul for a limited period of time, and your soul is your connection to God, to this Holy Spirit that's all-powerful, that's all-knowing.
[02:43:15.833 --> 02:43:35.071]   And this same creative force that is constantly expanding the galaxies in the universe You and I have access to it within our own minds, and we can accept what's happening in the world right now, or we can disassociate from our five senses, tap into the spiritual side of ourselves, and build a vision.
[02:43:36.492 --> 02:43:38.273]  And I believe this is how things change.
[02:43:38.854 --> 02:43:49.322]  Now, one of the most empowering things that I found about quantum physics and the observer effect is regardless of what's happening in the world, it's changeable.
[02:43:51.192 --> 02:43:59.857]  Steve Jobs, he had a quote, and he said that, once you realize the world was built by people no smarter than you, you can mold it, shape it, and change it however you want.
[02:44:00.437 --> 02:44:03.439]  Now, that's not just an inspirational quote.
[02:44:04.179 --> 02:44:06.621]  Observer effect of quantum physics shows us that.
[02:44:07.001 --> 02:44:19.788]  That this pen right here looks like a solid object, but all it really is is a mass of molecules, or an energy pattern, that vibrates at a frequency that's so dense, and we're so used to it, that it appears to be a solid object.
[02:44:20.488 --> 02:44:22.469]  Similarly is so for your bank account.
[02:44:22.789 --> 02:44:24.809]  Similarly is so for the state of the world.
[02:44:25.209 --> 02:44:27.250]  It's just an electromagnetic field.
[02:44:27.350 --> 02:44:36.512]  It's just a frequency pattern that has been vibrating at a certain amplitude or rate of vibration for so long that it seems immovable.
[02:44:37.152 --> 02:44:39.633]  And what I want to suggest that it is movable.
[02:44:40.673 --> 02:44:49.275]  Now, what the observer effect shows us is that there's these things, right?
[02:44:50.550 --> 02:44:50.870]  Atoms.
[02:44:51.451 --> 02:44:54.473]  And we always thought atoms were the building blocks of the universe.
[02:44:54.894 --> 02:44:57.756]  But there's these things even smaller called subatomic particles.
[02:44:58.136 --> 02:45:06.002]  And what they found out was that these subatomic particles would sometimes be observable and sometimes they would be invisible.
[02:45:06.703 --> 02:45:09.725]  Sometimes they would be a particle and sometimes they would be a wave.
[02:45:10.085 --> 02:45:14.389]  Meaning they were a frequency pattern that was no longer localized in space and time.
[02:45:15.029 --> 02:45:17.331]  Albert Einstein called this the spooky science.
[02:45:18.228 --> 02:45:19.349]  But what does this show us?
[02:45:19.809 --> 02:45:31.738]  Well, it shows us that the basis of reality that we think is real, the future that we are headed on right now, is actually totally changeable, malleable, and movable.
[02:45:32.819 --> 02:45:47.550]  And based off of our own consciousness, based off of our own vibratory rates, and based off of the own images that we're holding, we are affecting reality, first our own personal realities, and then collectively our whole world, from a subatomic level.
[02:45:48.707 --> 02:45:51.148]  This is why they don't want us to wake up.
[02:45:51.248 --> 02:46:03.051]  This is why they censored Reset Wars, and this is why they're stopping this information from getting out, is because if we wake up to the power of recreating our world, they lose.
[02:46:03.371 --> 02:46:07.532]  The whole goal is to keep us trapped in fear in the reptilian centers of our brain.
[02:46:08.092 --> 02:46:16.219]  And if you want to learn how to break free from that, you can head to ResetWars.com right now for the 50% off censorship special.
[02:46:16.620 --> 02:46:21.444]  That's ResetWars.com right now for the 50% off censorship special.
[02:46:22.205 --> 02:46:23.606]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:46:23.626 --> 02:46:34.075]  My name is Jake and I'm here in honor of the Reset Wars 50% off censorship special that is going on right now at ResetWars.com.
[02:46:35.859 --> 02:46:39.700]  You know, I've been on the show promoting Reset Wars real hard.
[02:46:40.540 --> 02:47:01.785]  And the reason that I'm promoting it so hard and why it's so obvious that they don't want this type of information in general to come out is, of course, as we've mentioned, we've had numerous iterations of censorship and numerous iterations of shutdowns of putting this work out there in the world.
[02:47:02.645 --> 02:47:11.905]   But more importantly, It's about giving their goal is about giving the appearance that we are not in control.
[02:47:12.945 --> 02:47:18.146]  And I go back to the question that Alex poses in the Reset Wars courses.
[02:47:18.746 --> 02:47:21.647]  Are you a victim to the New World Order?
[02:47:22.707 --> 02:47:27.268]  And so far today, we've talked a lot about the power of consciousness.
[02:47:27.708 --> 02:47:39.833]   We've talked about the really immeasurable power that you have as a human being because you're connected to God, you're connected to the universe.
[02:47:40.793 --> 02:47:48.196]  And you can harness this power to create measurable change and measurable impact in the world.
[02:47:48.976 --> 02:48:00.985]   But what happens is, based off of the way that we've been programmed from the time we were little children up until the time you're about six years old, You're in a brainwave state similar to hypnosis.
[02:48:01.085 --> 02:48:03.106]  You're in a hypnotic brainwave state.
[02:48:03.886 --> 02:48:08.709]  So we've inherited all of this conditioning from the way that we grew up.
[02:48:09.250 --> 02:48:14.553]  By the time we're about 18 years old, the neurological circuits in our brain have pretty much been formed.
[02:48:14.973 --> 02:48:18.295]  And then we spend the rest of our lives playing those programs out.
[02:48:19.446 --> 02:48:26.373]  And we come to build what's known as a personality and your personality might say you're good at this.
[02:48:26.413 --> 02:48:27.274]  You're not good at this.
[02:48:27.314 --> 02:48:28.595]  You're only capable of this.
[02:48:29.376 --> 02:48:35.341]  But what I invite you to consider is that your personality is is nothing more than an illusion.
[02:48:36.702 --> 02:48:40.486]  It's an illusion that feels very real due to the nervous system.
[02:48:41.078 --> 02:48:46.322]  There's a term in neuroscience that Alex talks about in the Reset Wars course called Hebb's Law.
[02:48:46.982 --> 02:48:50.625]  And Hebb's Law says that nerve cells that fire together, wire together.
[02:48:51.025 --> 02:48:57.309]  Every time we have a thought, every time we have an emotion, especially in the earlier years of our life, we fire cells in our brain.
[02:48:57.329 --> 02:49:10.118]  And when we fire the same cells over and over and over again, they wire together and they build the neurological circuitry in our brain similar to an old growth forest, how all the roots grow together.
[02:49:11.289 --> 02:49:15.212]  And they basically become one and it becomes a hardened root system.
[02:49:15.752 --> 02:49:18.134]  Well, similarly, that's all your personality is.
[02:49:18.774 --> 02:49:23.357]  But we now know through neuroscience and neuro meaning brain and plastic meaning changeable.
[02:49:23.757 --> 02:49:28.380]  We know through the changeable studies of the brain that you aren't stuck that way.
[02:49:29.441 --> 02:49:32.123]  And today we talked about building a vision.
[02:49:32.791 --> 02:49:37.174]  And three types of goals, an A-type goal, a B-type goal, and a C-type goal.
[02:49:37.714 --> 02:49:39.975]  And a C-type goal is a goal that you don't know how to do.
[02:49:40.496 --> 02:49:46.940]  So a C-type goal is when God fills you with a vision, an extraordinary purpose.
[02:49:47.640 --> 02:50:00.748]  But what happens to most people is once they're inspired by that, they move back into their old personality complex that rationally explains why they can't or can't, why they can or cannot do something.
[02:50:02.009 --> 02:50:17.041]   And The whole of this agenda relies, again, off of us believing we are just physical bodies, we are just our past, and we are what our brain or nervous system tells us.
[02:50:18.241 --> 02:50:23.223]  And there's two questions that Bob Proctor really changed my life with.
[02:50:23.743 --> 02:50:26.024]  And he said, number one, is it true?
[02:50:26.604 --> 02:50:29.245]  And number two, who would I be without that thought?
[02:50:30.322 --> 02:50:36.527]  Is it really true that because of the regime that you cannot find joy?
[02:50:37.087 --> 02:50:46.775]  Is it really true that you have to be depressed and angry and upset and resort to overdrinking or overusing of substances?
[02:50:47.195 --> 02:50:48.116]  Is it really true?
[02:50:50.138 --> 02:50:51.639]  And who would I be without that thought?
[02:50:52.039 --> 02:50:59.421]   Who would I be without the thought that I will always be in debt because of the debt slave system that was created.
[02:51:00.002 --> 02:51:02.302]  Who would I be without the thought that I don't know how?
[02:51:02.742 --> 02:51:12.644]  Who would I be without the thought, well, I want to build a big media company, I want to build an awesome podcast that inspires people, I want to do X, Y, and Z, but I don't know how.
[02:51:13.264 --> 02:51:14.564]  Who would I be without that thought?
[02:51:17.405 --> 02:51:33.092]   And there was a time in my life where I thought that The people with the power were just Joe Rogan or just Alex Jones or just some of the other great guests that would come on and expose what was happening in the world.
[02:51:33.772 --> 02:51:39.657]  And then there was a point in my life where I said, why am I giving my power away to everything outside of myself?
[02:51:41.099 --> 02:51:43.380]  And this is the question that they don't want us to ask.
[02:51:44.621 --> 02:51:46.403]  How am I giving my power away?
[02:51:47.444 --> 02:51:48.545]  And why am I doing it?
[02:51:50.026 --> 02:52:02.755]  Now, the answer to why we're doing it is because it's a habitual thought pattern, but we have something called free will, and that's the ability to think anything that we want to think and override the programs that are buried in the subconscious.
[02:52:03.616 --> 02:52:32.237]   And so the question that I invite you to keep in your back pocket as we end the show here today and you Pull out a pen and pad and you write down your big vision for the way that you're going to dent the universe, for the way that you're going to tap into the image in God in which you were made, and you're going to harness that divine power to do something powerful and do something meaningful and do something significant.
[02:52:33.598 --> 02:52:36.720]  Whenever the old thoughts come in, you ask yourself two questions.
[02:52:37.280 --> 02:52:38.881]  Is this really true?
[02:52:40.783 --> 02:52:42.564]  And the answer is probably no.
[02:52:43.675 --> 02:52:46.363]  And the next question is, who would I be without that thought?
[02:52:48.075 --> 02:52:49.376]  Who would I be without that thought?
[02:52:49.696 --> 02:53:14.372]  Because it's easy to think that you can't build a new, awesome business, you can't rebuild, you can't build an awesome new social platform, you can't do something powerful with the education system because, oh, well, we don't have In-Q-Tel funding us, and we don't have the venture capital behind us, or I don't have the charisma or the skill set that Alex Jones has, or whatever it might be.
[02:53:14.432 --> 02:53:16.253]  I'm too busy, I have too much going on.
[02:53:17.179 --> 02:53:18.240]  I don't have the time.
[02:53:19.081 --> 02:53:20.603]  Who would I be without that thought?
[02:53:22.185 --> 02:53:23.666]  Who would I be without that thought?
[02:53:24.928 --> 02:53:35.359]  You know, when Jesus said, mountains move and they shall, I don't think he sat back and said, but could I really?
[02:53:36.860 --> 02:53:38.022]  Is it actually possible?
[02:53:41.016 --> 02:53:45.698]  Because at every single second, this universal energy is flowing through us.
[02:53:46.059 --> 02:53:51.241]  And at every single second, you and I are making a free will decision of how we're going to harness this energy.
[02:53:52.882 --> 02:54:04.248]  And there's a quote that Tony Robbins says a lot, and he says that most people overestimate what they can accomplish in a year, and they underestimate what they can accomplish in a decade.
[02:54:05.208 --> 02:54:21.199]   And as we come to the conclusion today, Earlier in the show, I was a little emotional because just three minutes before I came on air, I found out that my mentor and one of my dear friends, Bob Proctor, had just passed away today.
[02:54:22.480 --> 02:54:28.045]  And it made me think about something.
[02:54:29.206 --> 02:54:30.588]  What do you want to leave behind?
[02:54:32.242 --> 02:54:35.785]  The life expectancy of a human being is roughly 78 years.
[02:54:36.005 --> 02:54:40.969]  You know, let's say it's higher now because of new advances in technology or whatnot.
[02:54:41.690 --> 02:54:47.455]  And I want you to just pull out a mental calculator in your head, take your age and subtract it by call it 80 years.
[02:54:47.995 --> 02:54:50.157]  You're 50 years old, subtracted by 80.
[02:54:50.357 --> 02:54:54.941]  That means you got roughly 30 years left.
[02:54:54.961 --> 02:54:55.542]  30 years left.
[02:54:57.322 --> 02:55:05.302]   And the question is, are you going to surrender your creative power to what's happening in the world, or are you
[02:55:05.302 --> 02:55:07.322]  going to do something about it?
[02:55:07.322 --> 02:55:11.322]  We're all not going to be Alex Jones.
[02:55:11.340 --> 02:55:18.183]  But in every single city, in every single state, in every single country, there's work to be done.
[02:55:19.083 --> 02:55:37.232]  Now, your work may not be altruistically feeding a million kids, but you might be able to harness the power of creative energy to double the sales in your business so you have double the resources to not only protect your family, but then to fund the projects that you care about and that you find meaningful.
[02:55:38.010 --> 02:55:39.651]  And I'm not asking you to believe me.
[02:55:40.252 --> 02:55:42.314]  I'm asking you to test this to yourself.
[02:55:42.814 --> 02:55:50.140]  I'm asking you to deepen your connection to God and deepen your connection to the universe and ask God to show up for you.
[02:55:50.540 --> 02:55:54.284]  To take a big, bold action somehow in your life today.
[02:55:54.904 --> 02:56:00.188]  Tap into a C-type vision and ask God to show up for you in a meaningful way.
[02:56:01.009 --> 02:56:03.131]  If you don't know how, it doesn't matter.
[02:56:03.471 --> 02:56:04.351]  You don't need to know how.
[02:56:04.712 --> 02:56:18.277]  If all the energy that ever was and ever will be is already created because energy can never be destroyed, that means the future, that means your problems, that means the know-how, the plan, the resources, it's already out there somewhere in the quantum field.
[02:56:18.897 --> 02:56:28.021]  But most people never find out that real magic of God and that real magic of the universe because they talk themselves out of it before they even get there.
[02:56:28.782 --> 02:56:32.223]  That's what they want to do and that's what they want to keep happening.
[02:56:33.067 --> 02:56:39.374]  So, I encourage you, if you're looking for a first step or a next step, to head to ResetWars.com right now.
[02:56:39.454 --> 02:56:41.496]  It's a 50% off censorship special.
[02:56:41.876 --> 02:56:48.343]  Learn how they reverse engineered everything, all of these new advances in quantum physics, to keep you stuck.
[02:56:48.624 --> 02:56:54.270]  How to rewire and reprogram your brain, your mind, your life, and how we can take this power to change the world.
[02:56:54.129 --> 02:57:11.250]   reset wars.com. Info Wars is all about setting new trends, starting new systems
[02:57:11.250 --> 02:57:13.848]  of awakening.
[02:57:12.553 --> 02:57:22.856]  We are not here chasing and following Hollywood, or the DC crowd, or the New York elitist, or any of these people's worldviews or ideas.
[02:57:23.257 --> 02:57:30.139]  We know who they are, we know what they're pushing, we know that their transhumanism is not a new idea, it goes back to the Garden of Eden.
[02:57:31.099 --> 02:57:41.956]  It is a satanic lie that we can transcend our bodies and become gods by merging with these different systems that the corrupt globalist priesthood has built.
[02:57:43.363 --> 02:58:12.843]  And to get us to accept transhumanism, to get us to believe our bodies are evil and bad, and that only the state or biomedical systems can save us, they have created the whole COVID-19 hysteria and fear to brainwash and abuse our children with masks and poison shots to teach us that we're inherently evil and bad and have to have the satanic sacrament of the GMO gene therapy injected into our bodies for the privilege to go outside and go to the park or have a job or fly on an airplane.
[02:58:13.583 --> 02:58:20.466]  And that's why it's more important than ever to realize that humanity is desperate for the truth.
[02:58:20.906 --> 02:58:28.769]  And with the almost total censorship happening in mainstream television and now even the internet, that makes info wars more precious than ever.
[02:58:29.409 --> 02:58:34.051]  And so a lot of times we set trends that are new and trailblazing.
[02:58:34.969 --> 02:58:42.714]  In other cases, we bring back things that are old, but that are absolutely crucial because of the changing battlefield that we face.
[02:58:43.234 --> 02:58:45.155]  And a great example of that is DVD.
[02:58:45.836 --> 02:58:47.077]  I've made 20 plus films.
[02:58:47.397 --> 02:58:51.059]  We always sell some of them, even though DVD in the last decade has been phased out.
[02:58:51.659 --> 02:59:00.425]  And suddenly, I noticed that we were selling out of all of my old back catalog of films.
[02:59:01.949 --> 02:59:04.312]  And I asked myself, why is that happening?
[02:59:04.933 --> 02:59:09.158]  So we emailed some of the customers and asked them, why are you suddenly buying DVDs?
[02:59:09.859 --> 02:59:14.124]  And they told us, it's because we know we need to have a hard copy in our library.
[02:59:14.504 --> 02:59:19.270]  We know because of censorship, we've got to go back to the old days, Alex, when you would put your films out.
[02:59:20.131 --> 02:59:24.614]  To the public and tell them to make copies of the DVD and we had a huge effect.
[02:59:24.914 --> 02:59:27.116]  Millions of copies were handed out to folks.
[02:59:27.656 --> 02:59:34.121]  And so organically, the listeners are trailblazing by going back to low tech to get around the sensors.
[02:59:34.701 --> 02:59:39.504]  They're making copies of the DVD, giving it to others and telling them make copies of the DVD.
[02:59:39.824 --> 02:59:44.408]  So COVID land, the mask, part two, incredibly powerful, an activist tool.
[02:59:45.268 --> 02:59:45.869]  It's now out.
[02:59:46.289 --> 02:59:47.110]  It's now available.
[02:59:47.370 --> 02:59:48.211]  We want you to get it.
[02:59:48.271 --> 02:59:49.592]  We want you to make copies of it.
[02:59:49.813 --> 02:59:50.694]  We want you to share it.
[02:59:50.974 --> 02:59:59.182]  And when you do that, you get two films on one DVD, absolutely free with it, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove and The Order of Death.
[02:59:59.522 --> 03:00:04.207]  And then that funds our operation and the filmmakers operation when you buy the one film.
[03:00:04.487 --> 03:00:08.631]  So it's available until the 13th at infowarsstore.com.
[03:00:09.412 --> 03:00:20.602]  February 13th, 2022 is your last chance to get COVIDLAND the film, Part 2 The Mask, for $19.95 and get two other films for your library.
[03:00:20.642 --> 03:00:27.589]  And then I want you to take all three of these films and make copies of them and share them with everyone you know.
[03:00:27.649 --> 03:00:34.014]  We can only offer this again for the next two weeks until February 13th and then this deal is going to be over.
[03:00:35.209 --> 03:00:40.814]  I cannot express to you enough how important it is to let people know this is censored information.
[03:00:41.135 --> 03:00:54.366]  Both the films on The Occult and The Globalist, and both the documentaries that are out, Part 1 and Part 2, on COVID land, of the real history and what really happened, and the real science that The Globalist are desperate for you not to learn.
[03:00:54.727 --> 03:00:56.168]  So thank you all for your support.
[03:00:56.488 --> 03:01:01.773]  Get your copy of COVID Land, The Mask, Part 2 and Part 1 as well at InfoWarsTour.com.
