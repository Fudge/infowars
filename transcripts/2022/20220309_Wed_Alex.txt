[00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:15.777]  Where they can coerce you as a healthcare worker, as somebody who works in a grocery store or wherever, to get that flu shot, and there are economic incentives to do this.
[00:00:15.777 --> 00:00:19.603]  So, where someone might say, this is not...
[00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:23.585]  Not, you know, federally controlled.
[00:00:23.585 --> 00:00:24.726]  Well, try again.
[00:00:24.726 --> 00:00:26.366]  It's all funded by the federal government.
[00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.247]  They're giving it away, and people are still rejecting it.
[00:00:29.247 --> 00:00:31.828]  In past years, consumers had to pay.
[00:00:31.828 --> 00:00:37.011]  Now they're saying you get the flu shot for free.
[00:00:37.011 --> 00:00:40.372]  Bill, that's my question to you.
[00:00:40.372 --> 00:00:42.873]  Analyzing this, I want your perspective.
[00:00:44.222 --> 00:00:47.784]  Is this just not the perfect federalization vehicle?
[00:00:47.784 --> 00:00:50.586]  Is this not just a beta test for the future?
[00:00:50.586 --> 00:00:55.849]  A way to clamp down on society during a financial meltdown or for other reasons?
[00:00:55.849 --> 00:01:06.095]  Even better than terrorism, a biological pathogen is the perfect way to be able to fully federalize things and take total control over society.
[00:01:06.095 --> 00:01:11.939]  And all the evidence that I'm seeing shows that this is a beta test for total federalization.
[00:01:14.284 --> 00:01:20.588]  The chirping agents of the New World Order are mindlessly and relentlessly demanding a no-fly zone.
[00:01:20.588 --> 00:01:28.013]  Over the past few days, there have been growing calls for the United States and NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine.
[00:01:28.013 --> 00:01:38.059]  This airspace safety is something that I think the people of Ukraine would see as extremely important for their freedom of movement and ability to get to safety.
[00:01:38.817 --> 00:01:42.641]  With forces battling on the ground, Ukraine is begging the U.S.
[00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:45.705]  and its allies for more firepower in the sky.
[00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:54.134]  Now the Biden administration is negotiating with Poland to give Ukraine its old Soviet-made MiG fighter jets and replace them with U.S.-made F-16s.
[00:01:54.955 --> 00:01:58.537]  NATO has said none of its 30 members are willing to set up a no-fly zone.
[00:01:58.537 --> 00:02:03.199]  President Biden has been very clear he has no interest in that or combat troops.
[00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:11.123]  But what more can the United States do here if, for instance, the Polish government, a NATO member, wants to send fighter jets?
[00:02:11.123 --> 00:02:13.104]  Does that get a green light from the U.S.
[00:02:13.104 --> 00:02:16.426]  or are you afraid that that will escalate tension?
[00:02:16.426 --> 00:02:17.986]  No, that gets a green light.
[00:02:17.986 --> 00:02:21.128]  In fact, we're talking with our Polish friends right now.
[00:02:21.613 --> 00:02:29.297]  As a passive public allows the fire to be stoked, there can only be one result if a no-fly zone is authorized.
[00:02:29.297 --> 00:02:36.261]  The acceleration of World War III, followed by a very good possibility of global thermonuclear war.
[00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:38.903]  Shall we play a game?
[00:02:38.903 --> 00:02:44.046]  How about global thermonuclear war?
[00:02:45.327 --> 00:02:47.849]  Which side do you want?
[00:02:47.849 --> 00:03:09.666]  If the talking head idiots succeed with their petition for a no-fly zone, a 24-hour airborne warning and control system long-range radar surveillance and control center for air defense, known as AWACS, would need to be protected by NATO's Air Force, which would quickly cause Allied fighter jets to engage Russian fighter jets.
[00:03:11.818 --> 00:03:21.685]  Russia's MAX Airshow, held every two years at an old flight test center outside of Moscow, is more than just a chance for Russian pilots to show off their skills.
[00:03:21.685 --> 00:03:30.011]  It's an important forum for Russia's aerospace industry to entice foreign buyers and to impress the boss with their latest creations.
[00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:34.135]  This year, aircraft manufacturer Sukhoi had a big announcement.
[00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:37.097]  A design for a brand new stealth fighter jet.
[00:03:39.178 --> 00:03:46.825]  Are you and your colleagues now more open to a no-fly zone?
[00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:50.988]  So, basically, a no-fly zone, if people understood what it means, it means...
[00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:52.912]  World War 3.
[00:03:52.912 --> 00:03:54.393]  It means starting World War 3.
[00:03:54.393 --> 00:04:04.540]  So, I think there are a lot of things we can do to help Ukraine protect itself, both from airstrikes and missile strikes, but I think people need to understand what a no-fly zone means.
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.082]  It's not just, it's not some rule you pass that everybody has to oblige by.
[00:04:08.082 --> 00:04:14.167]  It's the willingness to shoot down the aircrafts of the Russian Federation, which is basically the beginning of World War 3.
[00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:16.849]  That would be the point of no return.
[00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:20.011]  The globalists would be safe in their massive bunkers.
[00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:31.961]  And according to Putin's posturing, China's backing, and Russia's protocols, Putin says, look, if these anti-ballistic missiles are placed in Eastern Europe, if those missiles are placed on water,
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:44.909]  Patrolling the Mediterranean and the Northern Seas, and in Alaska, almost the whole Russian territory would be encircled by these systems.
[00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:54.317]  As you can see, that is another great strategic mistake by our partners, because all these actions are going to be adequately answered by Russia.
[00:04:54.317 --> 00:04:56.739]  A nuclear offensive would be imminent.
[00:04:56.739 --> 00:04:57.800]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:05:01.318 --> 00:05:04.662]  Two of our best-selling products are back in stock.
[00:05:04.662 --> 00:05:06.404]  Themfulwarestore.com.
[00:05:06.404 --> 00:05:11.749]  And they will sell out in the next 3-4 months before I get more of the product in if I sell it at full price.
[00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:20.338]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting Winter Sun or getting X3 to try the products and see how amazing they are.
[00:05:20.338 --> 00:05:24.322]  And I believe you will then get hooked on them like myself and my family.
[00:05:24.682 --> 00:05:25.862]  And the crew are.
[00:05:25.862 --> 00:05:28.263]  So again, both these products are back in stock.
[00:05:28.263 --> 00:05:30.063]  Both X3 and Winter Sun.
[00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:38.725]  They are 50% off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this price, I would estimate, in less than a month.
[00:05:38.725 --> 00:05:43.426]  So, this is your chance to get X3 and experience the good halogens versus the bad halogens.
[00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:48.307]  This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune system as well.
[00:05:48.307 --> 00:05:50.467]  They're amazing and they're at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:50.467 --> 00:05:54.088]  And the reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation.
[00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:56.673]  I need funds to run the operation.
[00:05:56.673 --> 00:05:57.596]  You need to be healthy.
[00:05:57.596 --> 00:05:58.799]  We need to stay on air.
[00:05:58.799 --> 00:05:59.761]  It's a match made in heaven.
[00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:07.641]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, March 9th, 2022.
[00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:12.184]  I will be here for the next four hours live.
[00:06:31.332 --> 00:06:36.254]  Dear TV viewer, you notice that the screens are all dead in here.
[00:06:36.254 --> 00:06:46.417]  I had the crew do that as a symbol of what it'll be like during a nuclear war with the power off, literally, for years.
[00:06:46.417 --> 00:06:51.939]  And it's estimated that a large-scale nuclear war would kill at least 5 billion people.
[00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:59.702]  A billion would die in a basic exchange between Europe, the United States against Russia, and back against the West.
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:11.788]  And then an estimated four billion people would then starve to death in the next two years.
[00:07:11.788 --> 00:07:16.531]  Will humanity destroy ourselves is the big question.
[00:07:16.531 --> 00:07:18.613]  And I want to really thank you all for joining us today.
[00:07:18.613 --> 00:07:22.135]  We've truly reached information overload point.
[00:07:22.135 --> 00:07:28.960]  So let me just tell you what we have here today and the three big guests that are going to be joining us.
[00:07:30.222 --> 00:07:45.668]  We have the Undersecretary of State, Victoria Nuland, the Ukraine-Eastern Europe expert, she's called, who helped architect the overthrow of the Russian-backed leader eight years ago, and was recorded on tape admitting that.
[00:07:45.668 --> 00:07:48.929]  She has now come out under oath in hearings and admitted the U.S.
[00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:59.453]  is running Level 4 bioweapon labs in Ukraine and near the border with Russia, and now they're claiming the Russians are going to get the bioweapons and release them
[00:08:01.238 --> 00:08:02.080]  On everybody.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:09.212]  So, first they had thousands of articles written the last week when the Russians came out and said there's bioweapon labs.
[00:08:09.212 --> 00:08:10.835]  And the media all said it's not true.
[00:08:10.835 --> 00:08:13.500]  They had countless articles saying Alex Jones is a Russian agent.
[00:08:14.767 --> 00:08:19.891]  Infowars are Russians because they're reporting the Russians are telling the truth.
[00:08:19.891 --> 00:08:23.734]  I don't side with anybody except God and my family and my country.
[00:08:23.734 --> 00:08:26.355]  And if the Russians are lying, I'll say they're lying.
[00:08:26.355 --> 00:08:29.278]  When they're telling the truth, I'll tell you that they're telling the truth.
[00:08:29.278 --> 00:08:30.879]  Because I could go back to the U.S.
[00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:41.847]  Pentagon funding tens of billions of dollars, over $10 billion the last decade in Ukraine, and all of this is going on, and there's Wall Street Journal articles and
[00:08:43.171 --> 00:08:47.653]  Department of Energy reports and National Geographic reports.
[00:08:47.653 --> 00:08:49.975]  I mean, we put a video together last week.
[00:08:49.975 --> 00:08:55.858]  I've aired it several times this week, dealing with the bioweapon labs.
[00:08:55.858 --> 00:08:56.818]  Gregory sent a report.
[00:08:56.818 --> 00:09:01.181]  We just show you the articles and news clips and government documents where they admit all of this.
[00:09:02.532 --> 00:09:16.145]  So that's a fact, and now they've gone from denying it to saying, oh, the Russians are going to get the bioweapons and release them, as if the Russians don't have their own bioweapons, as if they need to go invade and take over labs to do it.
[00:09:17.503 --> 00:09:24.168]  So this is just one more thing the New World Order has done to stir up and get in the Russians' face.
[00:09:24.168 --> 00:09:33.835]  Not just missiles, not just weapons, not just moving nukes close to Russia's border and delivery systems, but now confirming the bioweapon labs.
[00:09:33.835 --> 00:09:34.615]  Unbelievable.
[00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:35.776]  Now there it is.
[00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:36.517]  Russia says U.S.
[00:09:36.517 --> 00:09:38.758]  has biolabs with plague and anthrax.
[00:09:38.758 --> 00:09:39.439]  Ukraine, U.S.
[00:09:39.439 --> 00:09:41.780]  calls it absurd.
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.382]  But that was five days ago.
[00:09:44.382 --> 00:09:46.344]  Now they have done an about-face.
[00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:48.050]  And
[00:10:04.298 --> 00:10:05.519]  We're good to go.
[00:10:19.304 --> 00:10:26.365]  In fact, if Vladimir Putin intends to nuke a civilian center first with a nuclear weapon, I call for people to assassinate him.
[00:10:26.365 --> 00:10:27.686]  But he's not doing that.
[00:10:27.686 --> 00:10:35.327]  Anybody, I mean if Biden called to nuke an innocent city in Russia preemptively, I would call for Biden to be arrested.
[00:10:35.327 --> 00:10:38.468]  I mean, but he's obviously, hopefully not doing that too.
[00:10:38.468 --> 00:10:43.249]  I'm just saying hypothetically, before they run around saying Jones says assassinate Putin, I did not say that.
[00:10:43.249 --> 00:10:45.029]  I said if Putin was going to blow up Kiev,
[00:10:45.819 --> 00:10:50.204]  With a 50 megaton bomb and kill 3 million people and start World War III.
[00:10:50.204 --> 00:10:56.170]  Yeah, somebody put him in a rubber room injecting with Thorazine.
[00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.332]  Give him a lobotomy, but that's not what's going on.
[00:10:58.332 --> 00:11:00.234]  But the Pentagon was in Congress yesterday.
[00:11:00.234 --> 00:11:02.556]  We've got those clips coming up.
[00:11:03.673 --> 00:11:05.375]  And I forgot to tell the crew to get those.
[00:11:05.375 --> 00:11:06.116]  They're in the articles.
[00:11:06.116 --> 00:11:09.699]  There's several Pentagon spokespersons and State Department spokespersons.
[00:11:09.699 --> 00:11:10.400]  It's all over the news.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:17.968]  But saying that saying that the crew please grab that saying that they think he might preemptively use a nuke.
[00:11:17.968 --> 00:11:18.949]  We've got that coming up.
[00:11:19.926 --> 00:11:21.547]  We've got Zelensky over there.
[00:11:21.547 --> 00:11:22.847]  They're calling the new Churchill.
[00:11:22.847 --> 00:11:24.007]  Give me a break.
[00:11:24.007 --> 00:11:30.329]  He is a puppet who did get an overthrown regime handed to him back by George Soros.
[00:11:30.329 --> 00:11:32.510]  That doesn't mean I support Russia invading.
[00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.190]  It's just a fact.
[00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.151]  He's not Winston Churchill.
[00:11:35.151 --> 00:11:42.153]  And his three main brigades are Nazi brigades that go back to the stay-behind networks of the Nazis in World War II.
[00:11:42.153 --> 00:11:44.113]  They hail Hitler.
[00:11:44.113 --> 00:11:45.354]  And that's on record.
[00:11:45.354 --> 00:11:49.075]  I have a BBC report from five years ago talking about Ukraine's Nazi problem.
[00:11:50.236 --> 00:12:00.920]  So to compare Zelensky to Winston Churchill, again, is absolute, total BS, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:10.364]  And it is those brigades, right there on screen, that overthrew multiple elected governments, firebombed the police, all of it.
[00:12:10.364 --> 00:12:14.386]  So, there you see them hailing Hitler on tape in their new swastika symbol.
[00:12:15.854 --> 00:12:17.555]  We've got that.
[00:12:17.555 --> 00:12:19.157]  China warns hegemonic U.S.
[00:12:19.157 --> 00:12:22.059]  against Pacific version of NATO.
[00:12:22.059 --> 00:12:29.225]  Their head government spokesman also said that they blame NATO's expansion on what is happening with Russia invading.
[00:12:29.225 --> 00:12:33.129]  There's more peace talks going on throughout the week and more happening in Turkey.
[00:12:33.129 --> 00:12:35.350]  Very high level talks tomorrow.
[00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.153]  I hope Ukraine accepts the neutrality deal.
[00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:39.631]  Okay.
[00:12:58.962 --> 00:12:59.762]  To Ukraine.
[00:12:59.762 --> 00:13:01.963]  So that's not a real negotiation.
[00:13:01.963 --> 00:13:03.583]  Putin's going to want those eastern areas.
[00:13:03.583 --> 00:13:06.184]  He's going to want Crimea, them to accept its annexations.
[00:13:06.184 --> 00:13:07.564]  It's always been Russian.
[00:13:07.564 --> 00:13:13.206]  And then he's going to want them to have an agree for open free, new open elections that'll be monitored.
[00:13:13.206 --> 00:13:15.947]  And obviously they'll want a pro-Russian person put in.
[00:13:17.683 --> 00:13:29.831]  And I don't like any of that, but the point is I don't want nuclear war, I don't want worldwide energy collapse, I don't want 25% of the world's grain supply to be cut off, and that could cause tens of millions of deaths around the world.
[00:13:29.831 --> 00:13:41.739]  Because unlike the globalists that claim they really care about third world people while they try to starve them to death, I really do not want to kill those third world people by starvation and have their blood on my hands by my knowing this
[00:13:42.279 --> 00:14:02.349]  And turning a blind eye to what's going on, because that's what this really is about, is the great reset and global destabilization and bringing in authoritarian tyranny worldwide and making everybody forget about the last big tyranny that's still ongoing in most parts of the world of the lockdowns, the digital IDs, the vaccine passports, the global social credit score, carbon tax, fulcrum.
[00:14:02.349 --> 00:14:04.230]  So we have that.
[00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.291]  And then, ladies and gentlemen, there's so much more.
[00:14:06.291 --> 00:14:09.433]  When I say and, and there's like 15 other stacks at least.
[00:14:11.129 --> 00:14:18.092]  Total vindication of myself, of Tucker Carlson, of Dr. Darren Beatty, and of so many others.
[00:14:18.092 --> 00:14:27.997]  The New York Times reporter says, ton of FBI informants were at January 6th calls, traumatized fellow journalists, bitches, and admits it was basically staged by the feds.
[00:14:27.997 --> 00:14:28.898]  This is the senior
[00:14:29.884 --> 00:14:55.508]  National Security writer at the New York Times, Matthew Rosenberg, and he also says on the tape, it's on Infowars.com, gotten by undercover folks at Project Veritas, that, again, he understands that it was a staged event, basically, and this is the same guy that attacked Tucker Carlson mercilessly, and we have those articles where he lied and said there was no evidence of any federal informants there.
[00:14:56.786 --> 00:15:19.594]  We've got Senator Rand Paul weighing in on this, and we've got some new developments where we've learned that the Capitol Police aren't just setting up offices across the country and spying on their political opposition for the Democrats as a new Praetorian Guard, but that people like Steve Bannon, of course myself, Roger Shett, and others have been illegally spied on by Homeland Security since before Trump was even elected.
[00:15:19.594 --> 00:15:22.055]  So there's new articles out on that today.
[00:15:23.885 --> 00:15:26.686]  There's already a coup of multinational corporations through Biden.
[00:15:26.686 --> 00:15:27.667]  They did steal the election.
[00:15:27.667 --> 00:15:28.427]  They did install him.
[00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:31.909]  They're trying to sell the idea that it's illegal to say he stole the election.
[00:15:31.909 --> 00:15:42.174]  January 6th has now come out, the new public committee, and said that raising money to challenge elections is illegal, and they want the Justice Department to arrest anyone that raises money to challenge elections.
[00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:42.994]  That's totally lawful.
[00:15:43.474 --> 00:15:45.576]  So they're trying to outlaw their political opposition.
[00:15:45.576 --> 00:15:46.737]  That's coming up.
[00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:49.419]  And we've got bizarre statements from Biden just saying, get used to it.
[00:15:49.419 --> 00:15:53.262]  It's the way it is with the gas prices increasing and so much more.
[00:15:53.262 --> 00:15:55.524]  This is going to be one hell of a transmission.
[00:15:55.524 --> 00:15:56.645]  Please, everybody, you know, tune in now.
[00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:06.556]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great InfoWars listeners and viewers.
[00:16:06.556 --> 00:16:15.385]  If you will simply get X3 with all three types of good iodine that boost your immune system and help everything that goes on in your body at the cellular level,
[00:16:16.085 --> 00:16:17.226]  It will change your life.
[00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:18.387]  It will invigorate you.
[00:16:18.387 --> 00:16:19.548]  It will empower you.
[00:16:19.548 --> 00:16:22.671]  Almost everyone has iodine deficiency.
[00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:24.253]  Look into it for yourself.
[00:16:24.253 --> 00:16:25.714]  It's the opposite of fluoride.
[00:16:25.714 --> 00:16:27.916]  It's the good halogen.
[00:16:27.916 --> 00:16:31.319]  And then your purchase of X3 funds our operation.
[00:16:31.319 --> 00:16:37.084]  Now a lot of our products have been sold out and never came back in because of lockdowns and supply chain breakdowns.
[00:16:37.084 --> 00:16:39.486]  We were sold out of X3 for a long time.
[00:16:39.486 --> 00:16:40.487]  And I had it on sale.
[00:16:40.487 --> 00:16:40.828]  We're 50% off.
[00:16:40.828 --> 00:16:42.189]  A lot of folks have been getting it.
[00:16:42.449 --> 00:16:43.570]  And I was thinking, you know what?
[00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.253]  I'm going to bring it back on sale again just until it sells out.
[00:16:47.253 --> 00:16:54.640]  Because even though we won't make as much money in the long run, a lot of folks need this product, and we need to get the money from the sales in now to stay on air.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.244]  See your X3 right now at 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:17:00.504 --> 00:17:07.028]  I stay on air selling high quality products that you need, that you want, and that you're going to be happy with.
[00:17:07.028 --> 00:17:10.069]  That's why you come back and buy products from me again.
[00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:11.870]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:18.754]  I promote liberty, I promote freedom, I fight the globalists, and I'm able to do that because you buy products at InfoWarshaw.com.
[00:17:18.754 --> 00:17:20.275]  And listen, all the products are great.
[00:17:20.655 --> 00:17:31.138]  But when it comes to high-quality, storable food in an inflationary system with major supply chain breakdowns, this is an absolute 360 win, a no-brainer.
[00:17:31.138 --> 00:17:34.499]  And they've got high-quality, storable food ready to ship to you right now.
[00:17:34.499 --> 00:17:39.401]  The great folks at My Patriot Supply exclusively at PrepareWithAlex.com discounted.
[00:17:39.401 --> 00:17:43.142]  So again, beat inflation, be prepared, fund the InfoWar.
[00:17:43.142 --> 00:17:49.384]  The only way you lose is not taking action at InfoWarStore.com or PrepareWithAlex.com right now.
[00:17:49.684 --> 00:17:51.106]  This is high quality, storable food.
[00:17:51.106 --> 00:17:53.109]  This is how you beat inflation.
[00:17:53.109 --> 00:17:53.850]  Get yours today.
[00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:54.831]  It's ready to ship.
[00:17:54.831 --> 00:17:58.677]  But I wouldn't wait because prices are about to go up because inflation is exploding.
[00:17:59.142 --> 00:18:02.684]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here.
[00:18:02.684 --> 00:18:17.410]  All over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany, these tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, and then coming to your house and threatening, in some cases actually, taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:25.633]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process, where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[00:18:25.993 --> 00:18:27.795]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[00:18:27.795 --> 00:18:35.602]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S.
[00:18:35.602 --> 00:18:38.945]  government military grade at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:18:38.945 --> 00:18:40.867]  We have the entire line of silent
[00:18:40.967 --> 00:18:41.247]  I think so.
[00:18:59.798 --> 00:19:01.039]  A riotous mob.
[00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:06.942]  Whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.
[00:19:06.942 --> 00:19:08.002]  Insurrectionists.
[00:19:08.002 --> 00:19:11.304]  We will follow the facts wherever they lead.
[00:19:11.304 --> 00:19:12.425]  Domestic terrorists.
[00:19:14.409 --> 00:19:17.010]  The days of independent media are numbered.
[00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:20.132]  The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[00:19:20.132 --> 00:19:22.993]  They are now debanking us behind the scenes.
[00:19:22.993 --> 00:19:26.774]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[00:19:26.774 --> 00:19:31.917]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps.
[00:19:31.917 --> 00:19:35.178]  The traitors know they can shut us down by force.
[00:19:35.178 --> 00:19:38.420]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:38.940]  So be it.
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.302]  Make them silence us by force.
[00:19:42.302 --> 00:19:45.304]  This is the final battle of the information war.
[00:19:45.304 --> 00:19:46.565]  Give now.
[00:19:46.565 --> 00:19:48.086]  Buy products.
[00:19:48.086 --> 00:19:49.267]  Donate.
[00:19:49.267 --> 00:19:51.108]  Before everything changes.
[00:19:51.108 --> 00:19:53.950]  We need you to carry us through to the end.
[00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:55.311]  Victory or death.
[00:19:55.311 --> 00:20:00.895]  Go now to infowarstore.com.
[00:20:00.895 --> 00:20:05.498]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:05.498 --> 00:20:06.779]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:10.461 --> 00:20:14.961]  Meanwhile, behind the facade of this innocent-looking bookstore...
[00:20:36.711 --> 00:20:44.957]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the most demonized, lied-about attack broadcast in the world.
[00:20:44.957 --> 00:20:46.378]  You have found it.
[00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:48.819]  The tip of the spear.
[00:20:48.819 --> 00:20:55.524]  Promoting a pro-human, pro-God, future for humanity.
[00:20:55.524 --> 00:20:56.344]  All right, here we are.
[00:20:56.344 --> 00:21:00.987]  Global Bombshell.
[00:21:00.987 --> 00:21:02.488]  State Department confirms U.S.
[00:21:02.488 --> 00:21:04.570]  operating bioweapons labs in Ukraine.
[00:21:05.373 --> 00:21:10.158]  Pentagon warns Putin may use nukes preemptively.
[00:21:10.158 --> 00:21:18.426]  And then we've got articles out today, along with the thousands of others that came out the last few weeks, a debunked conspiracy theory about U.S.
[00:21:18.426 --> 00:21:24.752]  bioweapons laboratories in Ukraine was seized upon by Russia and Chinese media outlets.
[00:21:24.752 --> 00:21:27.795]  You mean like the Associated Press years ago reporting on it?
[00:21:30.802 --> 00:21:45.687]  And so they have Business Insider and all these other groups out there running around saying none of this is true when there were hearings yesterday where the Undersecretary of State came out and admitted this.
[00:21:45.687 --> 00:21:53.489]  So here's Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland admitting it.
[00:21:53.489 --> 00:21:55.770]  Does Ukraine have chemical or biological weapons?
[00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:14.563]  Ukraine has biological research facilities, which in fact we are now quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of.
[00:22:14.563 --> 00:22:17.786]  So we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can
[00:22:18.446 --> 00:22:21.188]  I'm sure you're aware that the Russian propaganda
[00:22:30.134 --> 00:22:39.739]  Two groups are already putting out there all kinds of information about how they've uncovered a plot by the Ukrainians to release biological weapons in the country and with NATO's coordination.
[00:22:39.739 --> 00:22:48.725]  If there's a biological or chemical weapon incident or attack inside of Ukraine, is there any doubt in your mind that 100% it would be the Russians that would be behind it?
[00:22:48.725 --> 00:22:59.030]  There is no doubt in my mind, Senator, and it is classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy what they're planning to do themselves.
[00:22:59.030 --> 00:22:59.611]  Last question.
[00:23:00.692 --> 00:23:03.114]  Oh yeah, is Russia going to invade the whole world?
[00:23:03.114 --> 00:23:06.417]  Is Russia going to teach five-year-old boys they're really girls?
[00:23:06.417 --> 00:23:07.398]  Are they going to open up the U.S.
[00:23:07.398 --> 00:23:07.698]  borders?
[00:23:07.698 --> 00:23:09.479]  Are they going to devalue the dollar?
[00:23:09.479 --> 00:23:13.763]  Are they going to cut off the Keystone Pipeline so that we go bankrupt?
[00:23:13.763 --> 00:23:16.585]  Are they going to shut down all the small businesses and say we're not essential?
[00:23:16.585 --> 00:23:26.234]  Are they going to finance the Wuhan lab with Fauci and Gates and then release the virus and then inject us with a deadly poison gene therapy that turns off our immune system and gives us blood clots and heart attacks?
[00:23:26.234 --> 00:23:27.555]  Oh no, that's you!
[00:23:28.604 --> 00:23:33.106]  The New World Order that has hijacked our country, and that's what Jesus said.
[00:23:33.106 --> 00:23:37.588]  They said, Christ, how will we know who's good and who's bad?
[00:23:37.588 --> 00:23:42.810]  Because the devil can quote scripture, can masquerade as angel of light.
[00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:48.052]  And Christ said, you will judge them by their fruits.
[00:23:48.052 --> 00:23:52.413]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:23:52.413 --> 00:23:53.474]  And what is the fruits?
[00:23:54.867 --> 00:23:56.669]  Of the people that now hijack this country.
[00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:58.410]  They hate the Midwest.
[00:23:58.410 --> 00:23:59.431]  They hate the South.
[00:23:59.431 --> 00:24:04.975]  They hate hard workers in the Western areas and Northern California.
[00:24:04.975 --> 00:24:09.078]  They hate everybody that loves God.
[00:24:09.078 --> 00:24:17.866]  And they've been starting a war with Russia for a long time and now poked Putin to come in there.
[00:24:17.866 --> 00:24:23.210]  And now they're blaming all the commodity prices exploding, the oil prices exploding on Putin.
[00:24:24.704 --> 00:24:32.389]  When that's just the icing on the cake and the cherry on top, the new increases, they were all going to continue on at high levels.
[00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:35.551]  Now they can just blame that.
[00:24:35.551 --> 00:24:37.852]  But I've got some even bigger news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:41.186 --> 00:24:46.390]  When I started the broadcast, I talked about these labs being admitted, being huge.
[00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:55.837]  I talked about the Pentagon warning that Putin may launch nuclear strikes first, which means the globalists may do a false flag and blame Russia, because I don't believe Russia is that stupid to actually start World War III.
[00:24:55.837 --> 00:25:00.321]  The globalists are satanic enough to do it.
[00:25:00.321 --> 00:25:10.809]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's this report right here that I'm going to get to in a moment that the Wall Street Journal and others have confirmed.
[00:25:12.091 --> 00:25:27.124]  It is simply striking to see this and to know this and to watch it only getting worse.
[00:25:27.124 --> 00:25:34.510]  And that is that world leaders will not even take phone calls from Biden now.
[00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:36.552]  What does that mean?
[00:25:36.552 --> 00:25:39.054]  It means they know he's not the president and he's a puppet.
[00:25:39.983 --> 00:25:43.525]  It's like the communist Chinese won't even talk to Biden now.
[00:25:43.525 --> 00:25:52.111]  They won't even come to negotiation tables with Blinken because they're insulted because they know these aren't people really in charge.
[00:25:52.111 --> 00:25:54.672]  They know Zelensky's a puppet.
[00:25:54.672 --> 00:25:56.814]  They know America's run by puppets.
[00:25:56.814 --> 00:25:59.635]  And that is the most damaging thing you can do to our country ever.
[00:25:59.635 --> 00:26:08.281]  I'm going to get to that in a moment, but here's a little compilation of US senators and others calling for preemptive nuclear war.
[00:26:09.912 --> 00:26:17.934]  War crimes and admitting it's a proxy war of the last eight years against the Russians.
[00:26:17.934 --> 00:26:19.455]  And the Russians have responded.
[00:26:19.455 --> 00:26:21.815]  Does not mean I agree with what Putin's done.
[00:26:21.815 --> 00:26:22.856]  I think he walked into a trap.
[00:26:22.856 --> 00:26:24.936]  It's stupid.
[00:26:24.936 --> 00:26:27.877]  But poke the bear.
[00:26:27.877 --> 00:26:29.278]  The bear is going to attack.
[00:26:29.278 --> 00:26:31.558]  And now the bear has walked into a bear trap.
[00:26:31.558 --> 00:26:33.519]  But that bear trap is a trap for the globalists as well.
[00:26:34.687 --> 00:26:39.752]  Because the American people aren't buying that it's Putin's fault that their gas prices went up and that every other commodity went up.
[00:26:39.752 --> 00:26:40.833]  They know.
[00:26:40.833 --> 00:26:42.174]  They know it's the lockdowns.
[00:26:42.174 --> 00:26:43.836]  They know it was the COVID garbage.
[00:26:43.836 --> 00:26:45.137]  They know it wasn't the virus.
[00:26:45.137 --> 00:26:48.741]  It was the policies used to collapse the economies.
[00:26:48.741 --> 00:26:50.262]  And there's the Wall Street Journal.
[00:26:50.262 --> 00:26:54.927]  Saudi emirate leaders declined calls with Biden during Ukraine crisis.
[00:26:54.927 --> 00:26:56.068]  Instead, they speak to Putin.
[00:26:56.068 --> 00:26:57.950]  And now other world leaders aren't talking to him.
[00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:58.631]  Here's some of the clips.
[00:26:59.215 --> 00:27:14.365]  Well, military action could mean that we stand off with our ships in the Black Sea and we rain destruction on Russian military capability.
[00:27:14.365 --> 00:27:15.726]  It could mean that.
[00:27:15.726 --> 00:27:18.088]  It could mean that we participate.
[00:27:18.088 --> 00:27:20.529]  And I would not rule that out.
[00:27:20.529 --> 00:27:24.112]  I would not rule out American troops on the ground.
[00:27:24.112 --> 00:27:28.835]  Do you know, we don't rule out first-use nuclear.
[00:27:31.578 --> 00:27:32.519]  Fight is our fight.
[00:27:32.519 --> 00:27:33.920]  2017 will be the year of offense.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.721]  All of us will go back to Washington
[00:27:44.341 --> 00:27:53.768]  And we will push the case against Russia.
[00:27:53.768 --> 00:27:57.851]  Enough of our Russian aggression.
[00:27:57.851 --> 00:28:03.296]  It is time for them to pay a heavier price.
[00:28:03.296 --> 00:28:10.241]  The United States aids Ukraine and her people so that we can fight Russia over there and we don't have to fight Russia here.
[00:28:11.144 --> 00:28:15.528]  When the Soviet Union, the Soviet Empire collapsed.
[00:28:15.528 --> 00:28:24.697]  And as the Empire collapsed, I moved in and picked up the pieces.
[00:28:24.697 --> 00:28:26.478]  First in Hungary in 1984.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.521]  That's right, replacing Russian control with his control.
[00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:41.484]  We'll be right back with world leaders refusing to talk to the puppet Biden.
[00:28:56.676 --> 00:28:58.302]  And Biden insulting America.
[00:29:00.433 --> 00:29:05.637]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022.
[00:29:05.637 --> 00:29:24.489]  And in the month of February, we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product X3 that has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much.
[00:29:24.489 --> 00:29:28.392]  And the majority of the population of the world is iodine deficient.
[00:29:28.392 --> 00:29:29.873]  This is the very best iodine out there.
[00:29:30.713 --> 00:29:34.595]  We had it on sale at 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have.
[00:29:34.595 --> 00:29:38.437]  Orders are going to come in for a long time, so I took it back to full price.
[00:29:38.437 --> 00:29:40.038]  And I was just thinking, you know what?
[00:29:40.038 --> 00:29:42.359]  We need the funds in now to stay on air.
[00:29:42.359 --> 00:29:44.741]  Plus, this is a great product everybody needs.
[00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:54.286]  So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience it for yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out.
[00:29:54.286 --> 00:29:57.647]  Get X3 right now exclusively at Infowarestore.com for 50% off.
[00:29:59.548 --> 00:30:02.469]  It has been noted by many a historian.
[00:30:02.469 --> 00:30:05.969]  The first casualty of war is the truth.
[00:30:05.969 --> 00:30:10.690]  Then the next big casualty isn't even the people that die.
[00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:12.811]  No, that invariably follows.
[00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:21.093]  But first there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty, and speech, and massive censorship.
[00:30:21.093 --> 00:30:27.454]  And now across the world, from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced that if you
[00:30:28.594 --> 00:30:38.079]  Amplify any, quote, pro-Russian information, you can be censored, you can be arrested, you can be imprisoned.
[00:30:38.079 --> 00:30:50.186]  And of course, now, Canada's introduced legislation that if you have a thought crime, and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online, that you will be censored and arrested.
[00:30:50.847 --> 00:30:56.718]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity.
[00:30:56.718 --> 00:30:58.782]  That makes InfoWars.com more important than ever.
[00:31:01.031 --> 00:31:01.772]  So I did it.
[00:31:01.772 --> 00:31:03.893]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[00:31:03.893 --> 00:31:11.418]  I've been training, probably not as much as I should be, but thank goodness for prayer, and thank goodness for InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:11.418 --> 00:31:17.242]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some TurboForce to give me that energy I need to get going.
[00:31:17.242 --> 00:31:30.451]  You know, besides the energy, TurboForce, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[00:31:30.811 --> 00:31:34.694]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones Soreless.
[00:31:34.694 --> 00:31:35.895]  I have bad joints.
[00:31:35.895 --> 00:31:36.796]  Thanks, Mom.
[00:31:36.796 --> 00:31:43.881]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[00:31:43.881 --> 00:31:48.324]  The quick-release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[00:31:48.324 --> 00:31:59.153]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, TurboForce, that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day, and Soreless can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:10.628]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled.
[00:32:10.628 --> 00:32:19.595]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their laws.
[00:32:19.595 --> 00:32:25.360]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers,
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:34.525]  Now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[00:32:34.525 --> 00:32:37.847]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[00:32:37.847 --> 00:32:42.170]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:48.273]  Like Canada, where they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario.
[00:32:48.273 --> 00:32:50.975]  And other areas of the world are following suit, like Australia.
[00:32:51.315 --> 00:32:53.136]  So pray for these folks big time.
[00:32:53.136 --> 00:32:55.198]  It's a very serious situation.
[00:32:55.198 --> 00:33:01.182]  Stay tuned in to Infowars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[00:33:01.182 --> 00:33:05.785]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:05.785 --> 00:33:07.066]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:20.874 --> 00:33:21.954]  Big Brother.
[00:33:21.954 --> 00:33:23.795]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:23.795 --> 00:33:25.655]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:25.655 --> 00:33:27.396]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:27.396 --> 00:33:29.036]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:29.036 --> 00:33:34.398]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.398 --> 00:33:37.059]  Global bombshell.
[00:33:37.059 --> 00:33:38.739]  State Department confirms U.S.
[00:33:38.739 --> 00:33:41.400]  operating bioweapons lab in Ukraine.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.501]  Pentagon warns Putin may use nukes preemptively.
[00:33:45.771 --> 00:33:50.057]  Welcome to Front Row Seats for the Potential of Armageddon.
[00:33:50.057 --> 00:33:51.139]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:51.139 --> 00:33:53.302]  Very thankful and blessed to be here today.
[00:33:53.302 --> 00:34:01.072]  Very thankful for all the listeners and viewers, all of our affiliates, our sponsors, our supporters, this great crew, and everybody who's in the InfoWars organization.
[00:34:01.969 --> 00:34:07.714]  That means all of you that spread the word and pray for the broadcast and buy the products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:34:07.714 --> 00:34:11.257]  You propel and empower this transmission.
[00:34:11.257 --> 00:34:24.449]  And as bad as the New World Order is and as bad as the things are that are happening, it's causing a great awakening because the very corrupt corporate forces, the very satanic forces of the planet, are having to take their mask off.
[00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:25.931]  They're having to take their gloves off.
[00:34:27.537 --> 00:34:31.458]  To try to keep us in line, and it's really showing who they are.
[00:34:31.458 --> 00:34:45.183]  I mean, I can tell you behind the scenes, world leaders call me, top billionaires, top media, and it's not just the folks everybody knows that I know are great people.
[00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:52.245]  I mean, it's basically a lot of people you just could think of have reached out in the last year.
[00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:55.266]  And it's accelerating.
[00:34:55.266 --> 00:34:56.606]  And they're asking, what do we do?
[00:34:56.606 --> 00:34:58.387]  Mr. Jones, we know you're right about this.
[00:34:58.387 --> 00:34:59.647]  And they've gone and done their own research.
[00:34:59.647 --> 00:35:01.548]  They know that it's accurate.
[00:35:01.548 --> 00:35:12.973]  And my answer is, get the more psychotic members of the elite to realize that they need to just turn loose and not try to dominate and control everybody, or they're going to destroy themselves.
[00:35:12.973 --> 00:35:18.735]  But they can't help it, because they're hyper-competitive to a point of being destructive.
[00:35:18.735 --> 00:35:19.716]  And they just can't quit.
[00:35:19.716 --> 00:35:21.436]  They don't know when to stop.
[00:35:21.436 --> 00:35:22.537]  And so we have to stop them.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.175]  And the first thing is not complying with them, being aware of their tricks.
[00:35:27.685 --> 00:35:49.411]  And then getting alliances together of intellectuals and artists and people that are wealthy and successful and people that are hard-working and from the most powerful people in the world down to the most common people, all of us coming together because a common farmer is just as important as a scientist or is just as important as a billionaire when they put their will into action.
[00:35:49.411 --> 00:35:53.972]  But you've got to realize you've got power and you've got to start using that will to do it.
[00:35:55.546 --> 00:36:04.870]  So I can tell you, by the grace of God, all glory goes to God, they could kill me right now or put me in prison right now, and that would just make us bigger.
[00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:05.810]  And I don't want that to happen.
[00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:06.310]  I'm selfish.
[00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:07.050]  I want to keep living.
[00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.771]  But I'm not compromising.
[00:36:08.771 --> 00:36:10.052]  I'm not backing down.
[00:36:10.052 --> 00:36:12.393]  I'm not selling out.
[00:36:12.393 --> 00:36:16.634]  And they've got a gun to my head, just so you know, literally and figuratively.
[00:36:16.634 --> 00:36:18.315]  And I'm just like, well, I'm in God's hands.
[00:36:19.434 --> 00:36:21.575]  Because I have to carry this all the way through.
[00:36:21.575 --> 00:36:24.176]  In fact, it's so easy now not to sell out.
[00:36:24.176 --> 00:36:25.937]  It was hard 25 years ago.
[00:36:25.937 --> 00:36:26.957]  It was hard 20 years ago.
[00:36:26.957 --> 00:36:30.718]  It was still not hard, but you know, tempting 15 years ago.
[00:36:30.718 --> 00:36:33.379]  I mean, I never did it.
[00:36:33.379 --> 00:36:39.582]  But now there's no going back, not even a 1% chance.
[00:36:39.582 --> 00:36:44.844]  I mean, I am totally committed, totally on the other side against Satan.
[00:36:45.786 --> 00:36:47.547]  And it is amazing.
[00:36:47.547 --> 00:36:48.408]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[00:36:48.408 --> 00:36:50.009]  Doesn't mean I'm not a sinner.
[00:36:50.009 --> 00:36:52.491]  Doesn't mean I don't make mistakes.
[00:36:52.491 --> 00:36:56.894]  But I am ten times the man I was twenty years ago.
[00:36:56.894 --> 00:36:58.115]  Ten times.
[00:36:58.115 --> 00:36:59.996]  Ten times the understanding.
[00:36:59.996 --> 00:37:01.717]  Ten times the will.
[00:37:01.717 --> 00:37:10.723]  And it's because I've been tortured and attacked and lied about and drugged through the mud at a lot of levels.
[00:37:13.246 --> 00:37:22.911]  Have just, you know, learned to basically deal with it and God never put pressure on me that I couldn't handle.
[00:37:22.911 --> 00:37:36.339]  And so I now realize that, and I realize it then that the torture and the attacks and the pain that that was done so that I would be strong later and be able to take what's now happening.
[00:37:36.339 --> 00:37:39.861]  So again, I see the mystery of God being fulfilled.
[00:37:41.664 --> 00:38:08.242]  learn more and more about the secrets of the universe at levels that are just indescribable in human terms in third dimensional terms and I know that those of you out there that are awake as well have also gone through experiences that are similar to mine in some cases even more extreme than mine and you understand that we are now kindred in that our spirits are kindred and that we have experienced
[00:38:09.099 --> 00:38:26.664]  The same thing, or similar things, and chewed some of the same dirt, and climbed some of the same hills and mountains, and been stabbed by some of the same daggers and swords, and been poisoned by some of the same concoctions, and that it has made us strong.
[00:38:26.664 --> 00:38:27.264]  Unbelievable.
[00:38:27.264 --> 00:38:35.686]  Alright, let's get into the huge news.
[00:38:35.686 --> 00:38:37.587]  To cover this information,
[00:38:39.284 --> 00:38:46.128]  And to really lay this out is a tightrope that has to be walked.
[00:38:46.128 --> 00:39:05.361]  Because if I don't fully explain how this phenomenon operates, we will actually be aiding the globalists in discrediting and destroying our republic, which they want to sink so that it's no longer an example of freedom and liberty and human empowerment around the world.
[00:39:05.361 --> 00:39:08.283]  So to do that they've infiltrated the institutions, they've taken over
[00:39:09.318 --> 00:39:38.307]  The churches, the Boy Scouts, the major Christian denominations, and they are selling that poisonous, evil, wicked idea worldwide into the world marketplace to poison the world, but at the same time have the world reject America and blame America for the satanic, perverted, pedophilic, Hollywood poison.
[00:39:39.588 --> 00:39:46.233]  When we are the main victim of the poison and of the globalist occupation.
[00:39:46.233 --> 00:40:03.045]  And so when we see Biden put in to discredit America and to make America look like a joke, to then empower the UN and empower other global forces and empower China, while playing us off against Russia, who's not fully controlled by the globalists.
[00:40:04.542 --> 00:40:22.753]  If we just come out and say, look what an idiot Antony Blinken is, or look what a moron Victoria Nuland is, or look at how pathetic Prince Valiant Fiona Hill is, or Vitamin, or any of these losers, or Obama, or Hillary.
[00:40:22.753 --> 00:40:24.694]  They're just high-level gophers.
[00:40:24.694 --> 00:40:27.335]  They're just front men and women.
[00:40:27.335 --> 00:40:30.818]  And so they put Biden in so he'd be doddering and be a fool.
[00:40:30.818 --> 00:40:33.119]  They put him in so that
[00:40:34.013 --> 00:40:43.495]  They could blame all their criminal agenda and raping the American people and destroying our energy and shutting down our infrastructure on him so the globalists wouldn't get the blame.
[00:40:43.495 --> 00:40:55.438]  And so Larry Fink and Klaus Schwab can then offer their solution to an angrier, collapsing world of the global universal income takeover.
[00:40:55.438 --> 00:40:58.179]  And by the way, Larry Fink, I played the clips a few weeks ago.
[00:40:58.179 --> 00:41:02.460]  We had the clip.
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.140]  Larry Fink.
[00:41:07.608 --> 00:41:17.291]  Came out and Larry Fink said, we're creating an angrier world and we're going to blame nation states for this colossal crisis.
[00:41:17.291 --> 00:41:22.472]  And then corporations are going to then step in as the solution and quote, fix everything with free money.
[00:41:22.472 --> 00:41:24.333]  Yeah, there he is.
[00:41:24.333 --> 00:41:26.973]  And there he is at Davos talking about it.
[00:41:26.973 --> 00:41:28.314]  They think you're so dumb.
[00:41:28.314 --> 00:41:30.634]  They sit around and talk about how they're doing this to you.
[00:41:30.634 --> 00:41:32.075]  So yes, we don't like Biden.
[00:41:32.075 --> 00:41:33.015]  And yes, he's a joke.
[00:41:33.015 --> 00:41:34.055]  And yes, he's a fraud.
[00:41:34.055 --> 00:41:36.936]  And yes, he's a puppet, but he's a puppet to these people.
[00:41:39.008 --> 00:41:53.014]  And so when I read these articles here out of the Wall Street Journal, you name it, Biden tried to ask Saudis and UAE for more oil, but they refused to take his calls and talked to Putin instead and told them, we're not talking to you because you're not in charge.
[00:41:53.014 --> 00:41:57.835]  They can just call the real president.
[00:41:57.835 --> 00:41:59.136]  Larry, think if they want to.
[00:41:59.136 --> 00:42:01.777]  And I mean, he is the president, the head of BlackRock.
[00:42:03.206 --> 00:42:08.587]  Saudi's UAE refused to take Biden's calls to discuss the Ukraine situation, talked to Putin instead.
[00:42:08.587 --> 00:42:11.368]  You can put the Wall Street Journal up there on screen for folks.
[00:42:11.368 --> 00:42:21.410]  Viktor Orban refuses to punish Hungarian families for Russian-Ukraine war, does not embargo their fuel.
[00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:30.952]  So that is such a big deal that we're so pathetic in the world's eyes that have been positioned for collapse at such a great level for China by the globalists.
[00:42:31.525 --> 00:42:35.106]  Bill Gates is over there giving them the latest reactors and the latest supercomputers.
[00:42:35.106 --> 00:42:38.128]  Google won't work with the Pentagon, but they'll work with Communist China.
[00:42:38.128 --> 00:42:49.972]  We're being positioned for destruction, where our economy's brought down as the Russian economy's brought down, while we kill each other, and then in swoops the globalist arm and China in the end.
[00:42:49.972 --> 00:42:56.314]  So China's acting like they're big buddies over there, but they're not.
[00:42:56.314 --> 00:42:57.655]  They're not big buddies with Russia.
[00:43:00.071 --> 00:43:06.195]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great InfoWars listeners and viewers.
[00:43:06.195 --> 00:43:15.020]  If you will simply get X3 with all three types of good iodine that boost your immune system and help everything that goes on in your body at the cellular level,
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.861]  It will change your life.
[00:43:16.861 --> 00:43:18.021]  It will invigorate you.
[00:43:18.021 --> 00:43:19.202]  It will empower you.
[00:43:19.202 --> 00:43:22.304]  Almost everyone has I and I deficiency.
[00:43:22.304 --> 00:43:23.904]  Look into it for yourself.
[00:43:23.904 --> 00:43:25.345]  It's the opposite of fluoride.
[00:43:25.345 --> 00:43:27.566]  It's the good halogen.
[00:43:27.566 --> 00:43:30.948]  And then your purchase of X3 funds our operation.
[00:43:30.948 --> 00:43:36.711]  Now a lot of our products have been sold out and never came back in because of lockdowns and supply chain breakdowns.
[00:43:36.711 --> 00:43:38.772]  We were sold out of X3 for a long time.
[00:43:38.772 --> 00:43:41.814]  And I had it on sale for 50% off and a lot of folks were getting it.
[00:43:42.014 --> 00:43:43.295]  And I was thinking, you know what?
[00:43:43.295 --> 00:43:46.898]  I'm gonna bring it back on sale again, just until it sells out.
[00:43:46.898 --> 00:43:54.283]  Because even though we won't make as much money in the long run, a lot of folks need this product, and we need to get the money from the sales in now to stay on air.
[00:43:54.283 --> 00:43:57.666]  See your X3 right now at 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:43:59.256 --> 00:44:13.775]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put in place.
[00:44:14.595 --> 00:44:19.760]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:27.987]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun.
[00:44:27.987 --> 00:44:36.214]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[00:44:36.214 --> 00:44:36.995]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:44:37.967 --> 00:44:40.769]  We are crossing the Rubicon now.
[00:44:40.769 --> 00:44:44.032]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[00:44:44.032 --> 00:44:50.397]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of the World ID and carbon taxes.
[00:44:50.397 --> 00:44:52.499]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[00:44:52.499 --> 00:44:56.022]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[00:44:56.022 --> 00:44:58.224]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[00:45:02.771 --> 00:45:03.931]  Granny Do-Right.
[00:45:03.931 --> 00:45:04.731]  Granny Do-Right.
[00:45:04.731 --> 00:45:05.932]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:45:05.932 --> 00:45:06.372]  Go ahead.
[00:45:06.372 --> 00:45:06.912]  Hi, Alex.
[00:45:06.912 --> 00:45:09.532]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[00:45:09.532 --> 00:45:20.234]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[00:45:20.234 --> 00:45:26.235]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[00:45:26.235 --> 00:45:27.236]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[00:45:29.536 --> 00:45:37.240]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:46.004]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[00:45:46.004 --> 00:45:46.824]  This is working.
[00:45:46.824 --> 00:45:47.825]  This is wonderful.
[00:45:47.825 --> 00:45:52.347]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know.
[00:45:52.347 --> 00:45:57.009]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[00:46:00.058 --> 00:46:00.799]  So I did it.
[00:46:00.799 --> 00:46:02.900]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:10.445]  I've been training, probably not as much as I should be, but thank goodness for prayer, and thank goodness for InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:10.445 --> 00:46:16.249]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some Turbo Force to give me that energy I need to get going.
[00:46:16.249 --> 00:46:29.458]  You know, besides the energy, Turbo Force, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[00:46:29.838 --> 00:46:33.699]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones Soreless.
[00:46:33.699 --> 00:46:34.920]  I have bad joints.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.820]  Thanks, Mom.
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:42.902]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[00:46:42.902 --> 00:46:47.344]  The quick-release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[00:46:47.344 --> 00:46:58.167]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, TurboForce, that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day, and Soreless can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[00:47:00.566 --> 00:47:05.167]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:05.167 --> 00:47:10.829]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:13.090]  Well, Augustine,
[00:47:28.544 --> 00:47:38.795]  Karstens is the head of the World Economic Forum's banking sector, and he's also the general manager for the Bank of International Settlements.
[00:47:38.795 --> 00:47:43.921]  And if you're wondering where all your freedoms went in banking with him spying on you, well, he ate them.
[00:47:43.921 --> 00:47:46.704]  And I say that because he is quite large.
[00:47:46.704 --> 00:47:48.285]  It's just a joke I like to make.
[00:47:49.005 --> 00:47:51.928]  But I want to play a clip so you know where this is all going.
[00:47:51.928 --> 00:47:57.354]  Remember that nominee that failed a few months ago because she was a communist that was going to be the head U.S.
[00:47:57.354 --> 00:47:58.655]  bank regulator?
[00:47:58.655 --> 00:48:05.723]  And she said, oh, we own all the money in your account, and the Federal Reserve should be able to take money out of your account whenever it wants.
[00:48:05.723 --> 00:48:08.726]  No judge, no jury, no warrant, no court finding.
[00:48:08.726 --> 00:48:09.146]  Remember that?
[00:48:09.747 --> 00:48:10.948]  People said, where does she get that?
[00:48:10.948 --> 00:48:18.474]  Well, that's from the IMF and the World Bank and the Bank of International Settlements that manages and tracks all the money around the world.
[00:48:18.474 --> 00:48:23.698]  And now they're coming out with their global digital system that everything else has to be fed through.
[00:48:23.698 --> 00:48:29.142]  And then they're going to track and trace everything you do with it.
[00:48:29.142 --> 00:48:31.544]  And so here he is, this just came out yesterday, BIS,
[00:48:34.414 --> 00:48:38.336]  Our analysis on CBDC, in particular for the use of general, to the general use,
[00:49:01.978 --> 00:49:09.283]  We tend to establish the equivalence with cash, and there is a huge difference there.
[00:49:09.283 --> 00:49:15.567]  For example, in cash, we don't know, for example, who's using a $100 bill today.
[00:49:15.567 --> 00:49:17.808]  We don't know who is using a $1,000 bill today.
[00:49:17.808 --> 00:49:19.449]  Oh my goodness!
[00:49:19.449 --> 00:49:25.153]  A key difference with the CBDC is that central banks will have
[00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:40.360]  Absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine the use of that expression of central bank liability and also we will have the technology to enforce that.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:47.641]  Those two issues are extremely important and that makes a huge difference with respect to what cash is.
[00:49:51.798 --> 00:49:57.088]  So they are all over the news, all the big central bank heads and then the regional heads.
[00:49:57.088 --> 00:50:01.797]  They had the head of the private bank that masquerades as a government bank up in Canada last week say,
[00:50:03.035 --> 00:50:06.638]  Very soon, we'll tell you where you can spend your money and how you can.
[00:50:06.638 --> 00:50:11.082]  And if it's environmental, we'll let you use it if we say it's good for the earth.
[00:50:11.082 --> 00:50:13.985]  But if it's bad, then we're going to tax you.
[00:50:13.985 --> 00:50:15.406]  And we'll just do this whenever we want.
[00:50:15.406 --> 00:50:17.688]  No judge, no jury, no laws.
[00:50:17.688 --> 00:50:21.732]  Just the international banks will set it, and then you will submit to it.
[00:50:21.732 --> 00:50:26.276]  But to do that, they first got to devalue the dollar, devalue the yen, the yuan.
[00:50:27.208 --> 00:50:32.831]  The peso, the shekel, the ruble, and then have everybody agree to go to a new global digital standard.
[00:50:32.831 --> 00:50:36.494]  You'll still have your local money, but it'll be pegged and set to that.
[00:50:36.494 --> 00:50:41.457]  I like your driver's license that says Texas or New York, but it's part of the real ID.
[00:50:41.457 --> 00:50:43.338]  It's really a national ID.
[00:50:43.338 --> 00:50:45.319]  The real ID.
[00:50:45.319 --> 00:50:48.761]  Well, now imagine a global ID, and with that, all the control.
[00:50:48.761 --> 00:50:54.985]  And they admit out of the gates, what you saw with the Canadian truckers is what they're going to do with these systems.
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:58.120]  And you heard him.
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:07.403]  He said, listen, we can't just let somebody have a hundred dollar bill or a thousand peso and then not know what they're doing.
[00:51:07.403 --> 00:51:10.123]  I mean, we already track everything you do online.
[00:51:10.123 --> 00:51:11.344]  We already watch and listen to you.
[00:51:11.344 --> 00:51:14.965]  You already got assistants in your house, little robots that, you know, watch and listen to you.
[00:51:14.965 --> 00:51:23.227]  Well, now, now we're going to have it where the money tracks everything you do and controls you with a carbon tax and more.
[00:51:24.718 --> 00:51:30.768]  And that's what the COVID-19 power grab was all about, was introducing that idea to the world.
[00:51:30.768 --> 00:51:35.155]  And when we played world leaders, Cleps saying, hey, no one would have accepted.
[00:51:36.789 --> 00:51:39.110]  Taking a gene therapy in their body.
[00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:44.332]  95% of people, the head of Bayer said last week, would never have accepted these gene therapies.
[00:51:44.332 --> 00:51:46.634]  We could never get them approved because they killed so many people.
[00:51:46.634 --> 00:51:56.738]  But we gave an emergency authorization, called it a vaccine, censored anybody that criticized it, shut them up, and then forced it on billions of people.
[00:51:56.738 --> 00:52:00.380]  And now, oh, we're going to roll out all these other things without regular authorization.
[00:52:01.587 --> 00:52:08.673]  I mean, it's just all the standards, all the protections of civilization, the social contract itself being broken.
[00:52:08.673 --> 00:52:17.560]  Now, there's a bunch of these clips of Psaki and Biden and the rest of it, but here's a clip of Biden yesterday evening in Fort Worth, Texas.
[00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:19.811]  He's asked about the gas price.
[00:52:19.811 --> 00:52:21.952]  He says there's nothing he can do.
[00:52:21.952 --> 00:52:24.434]  That is a 100% lie.
[00:52:24.434 --> 00:52:30.718]  He can turn the Keystone Pipeline on to bring those millions of barrels a day from Canada down.
[00:52:30.718 --> 00:52:42.646]  Canada can't ship it here, so it's put on trains owned by George Soros and Warren Buffett on record, shipped to the west coast of Canada, British Columbia, and shipped to China and to Japan.
[00:52:42.646 --> 00:52:43.627]  That's how you turn the U.S.
[00:52:43.627 --> 00:52:44.287]  economy off.
[00:52:44.287 --> 00:52:45.348]  That's how we're non-essential.
[00:52:46.326 --> 00:52:48.048]  And he could do that.
[00:52:48.048 --> 00:52:53.634]  He could take the drilling on public lands that's half the country's federal land.
[00:52:53.634 --> 00:52:54.996]  They could take those off.
[00:52:54.996 --> 00:52:59.341]  He could take the other restrictions, the Gulf of Mexico off, because somebody else is going to drill it.
[00:52:59.341 --> 00:53:06.068]  But no, no, no, he can't do much because we're in a transition of bankrupting you.
[00:53:06.068 --> 00:53:06.429]  Here he is.
[00:53:12.867 --> 00:53:14.308]  Russia's responsible.
[00:53:14.308 --> 00:53:17.671]  A bunch of lazy government bureaucrats around him.
[00:53:17.671 --> 00:53:21.814]  Everybody wearing their little outfits like a bunch of wicked witches, flying monkeys.
[00:53:43.868 --> 00:53:45.250]  And it's just so much fun.
[00:53:45.250 --> 00:53:45.951]  There's the puppet.
[00:53:45.951 --> 00:53:47.392]  World leaders won't even talk to him.
[00:53:47.392 --> 00:53:48.133]  It's a total joke.
[00:53:48.133 --> 00:53:50.216]  But all the Americans fawn after him.
[00:53:50.216 --> 00:53:51.678]  Oh, all the libtards.
[00:53:51.678 --> 00:53:52.399]  It's so cute.
[00:53:52.399 --> 00:53:56.103]  He goes, there's not much I can do.
[00:53:56.103 --> 00:53:58.366]  They're going to go up.
[00:53:58.366 --> 00:53:59.488]  It's Putin's fault.
[00:53:59.488 --> 00:54:00.489]  It's Russia's fault.
[00:54:00.489 --> 00:54:02.572]  Yeah, you lying maggot.
[00:54:03.857 --> 00:54:10.542]  And Saki laughs when they say, please turn on the Keystone Pipeline that would literally lower the prices down to below $3.
[00:54:10.542 --> 00:54:11.442]  That's on record.
[00:54:11.442 --> 00:54:15.345]  Keystone Pipeline would lower prices to down below $3 instead of over $4.
[00:54:15.345 --> 00:54:16.646]  Screw you!
[00:54:16.646 --> 00:54:18.887]  Screw you!
[00:54:18.887 --> 00:54:21.449]  China gets a new coal plant every week.
[00:54:21.449 --> 00:54:24.171]  We get them shut down every week.
[00:54:24.171 --> 00:54:25.752]  China gets all our oil.
[00:54:25.752 --> 00:54:27.553]  We don't get jack squat.
[00:54:29.642 --> 00:54:48.758]  And you look at these politicians, and these Air Force people, and just all of them, and they're part of the establishment, they think they're cool, they're the officer corps, they're the globalist corps, and they are literally sucking this country dry, and the world knows it, and has no respect for our leadership, because our leadership are not even Americans.
[00:54:48.758 --> 00:54:54.123]  They're a pack of criminals, raping and looting the country into oblivion, and hating
[00:54:55.127 --> 00:54:59.771]  The Americans that are left for every race, color, and creed that want justice and freedom and a future.
[00:54:59.771 --> 00:55:11.862]  And they just laugh at us with disdain, but they also fear us because they know we might actually get back control of our country and stop their looting and criminal activity.
[00:55:11.862 --> 00:55:15.665]  I don't even care about bringing them to justice, though that's important.
[00:55:15.665 --> 00:55:17.066]  I just want to get them off of us.
[00:55:17.066 --> 00:55:18.447]  I want to stop it.
[00:55:18.447 --> 00:55:20.129]  Coming up next hour, Joel Scowls, informer.
[00:55:20.933 --> 00:55:21.353]  Thank you
[00:55:51.413 --> 00:55:52.094]  We're good to go.
[00:56:07.305 --> 00:56:17.229]  In just a few days, because it's about to sell out, highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K. Why am I not going to go back to full price, even though more won't come in for probably five, six months?
[00:56:17.229 --> 00:56:24.051]  Because I want you to get it, and I want you to have a good immune system, and I want people that have been on the fence about trying these products to get them.
[00:56:24.051 --> 00:56:25.932]  So, it's super high quality.
[00:56:25.932 --> 00:56:33.415]  We can sell synthetic D3 for, you know, a lot less, but this is high quality D3 with vitamin K at a very low price.
[00:56:34.335 --> 00:56:35.255]  It's 50% off.
[00:56:35.255 --> 00:56:36.736]  We also have X3.
[00:56:36.736 --> 00:56:39.017]  Big runs on quality iodine out there.
[00:56:39.017 --> 00:56:41.398]  People learn about immune system and so many other issues.
[00:56:41.398 --> 00:56:43.139]  This is all three types of iodine you need.
[00:56:43.139 --> 00:56:44.479]  It is amazing.
[00:56:44.479 --> 00:56:46.520]  The Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, two other types.
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:51.802]  It is 50% off.
[00:56:51.802 --> 00:56:57.184]  And it is selling out at current sales rates in the next week.
[00:56:57.184 --> 00:56:58.705]  Maybe even sooner.
[00:56:58.705 --> 00:57:00.725]  And I'm going to keep it at 50% off regardless.
[00:57:00.725 --> 00:57:01.726]  Infowarstore.com
[00:57:03.473 --> 00:57:05.094]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:05.094 --> 00:57:09.758]  I want to thank you all for your support, but you really need to experience this.
[00:57:09.758 --> 00:57:12.561]  And then finally, sold out the first two batches we got.
[00:57:12.561 --> 00:57:13.362]  It's finally back in.
[00:57:13.362 --> 00:57:15.063]  It's been sold out for five months.
[00:57:15.063 --> 00:57:16.284]  Brain Force Ultra.
[00:57:16.284 --> 00:57:19.447]  Very fast-acting, clean, amazing nootropic.
[00:57:19.447 --> 00:57:20.688]  It's beyond nootropic.
[00:57:20.688 --> 00:57:23.550]  And it also wears off in two to three hours, which is what I like.
[00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:28.695]  You can take this in the evening when you've got to finish some work up or whatever, but then still go to sleep, in my experience.
[00:57:28.695 --> 00:57:30.056]  That's the reviews we're getting.
[00:57:30.717 --> 00:57:38.327]  That is, again, Brain Force Ultra, InfoWarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:38.327 --> 00:57:40.730]  Get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt at Storable Food as well.
[00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:43.253]  Get ready while you still can and fund the Info War.
[00:57:43.253 --> 00:57:44.475]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:57:44.475 --> 00:57:45.016]  Please stay with us.
[00:57:50.342 --> 00:57:55.586]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022.
[00:57:55.586 --> 00:58:14.418]  And in the month of February, we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product X3 that has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much.
[00:58:14.418 --> 00:58:18.301]  And the majority of the population in the world is iodine deficient.
[00:58:18.301 --> 00:58:19.802]  This is the very best iodine out there.
[00:58:20.602 --> 00:58:24.444]  We had it on sale for 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have.
[00:58:24.444 --> 00:58:28.366]  More isn't going to come in for a long time, so I took it back to full price.
[00:58:28.366 --> 00:58:29.926]  And I was just thinking, you know what?
[00:58:29.926 --> 00:58:32.287]  We need the funds in now to stay on air.
[00:58:32.287 --> 00:58:34.668]  Plus, this is a great product everybody needs.
[00:58:34.668 --> 00:58:44.213]  So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience it yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out.
[00:58:44.213 --> 00:58:47.574]  Get X3 right now exclusively at InfowarsStore.com for 50% off.
[00:58:49.770 --> 00:58:52.632]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[00:58:52.632 --> 00:59:06.621]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech, government are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[00:59:06.621 --> 00:59:11.064]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[00:59:11.064 --> 00:59:19.450]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:22.653]  That's why everybody should visit InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:59:43.112 --> 00:59:44.213]  Check out the new line.
[00:59:44.213 --> 00:59:44.754]  It's amazing.
[00:59:50.942 --> 00:59:56.848]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:30.013]  Think about the arrogance of Biden.
[01:00:30.013 --> 01:00:32.154]  Just saying, hey, it's going up.
[01:00:32.154 --> 01:00:33.355]  Get used to it.
[01:00:33.355 --> 01:00:34.755]  It's all Russia's fault.
[01:00:34.755 --> 01:00:37.397]  And then the talking point's how the Democrats are.
[01:00:37.397 --> 01:00:39.598]  We're going to stop Putin and pay.
[01:00:39.598 --> 01:00:41.339]  These people are filthy rich.
[01:00:41.339 --> 01:00:43.600]  They've got drivers that drive them around.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.782]  And to them, hey, it's no pain to them.
[01:00:45.782 --> 01:00:47.563]  They just pass it on to you, their enemy.
[01:00:47.563 --> 01:00:47.903]  Here it is.
[01:01:07.687 --> 01:01:22.754]  And of course the answer in the EU and here and everywhere else with exploding energy prices from devaluation of currencies and all these wars and the sanctions is, oh, we need trillions in new green deals, more windmills, more electric cars.
[01:01:22.754 --> 01:01:24.275]  Stephen Colbert laughed two nights ago.
[01:01:25.438 --> 01:01:32.125]  He said, I almost played the clip, but he's so arrogant and insufferable I can't even look at him.
[01:01:32.125 --> 01:01:34.667]  He goes, I don't have to worry, I've got a Tesla.
[01:01:34.667 --> 01:01:37.190]  And look, nothing against Teslas, nothing against electric cars.
[01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:47.601]  They cost a lot of money, and it takes twice as much carbon on average to make an electric car, and then most of the electricity generated that the cars get uses more carbon
[01:01:49.315 --> 01:02:00.262]  to produce the electricity than the fuel does right there in the engine, because you lose on average about half the energy when you're transferring it down power lines and then into the vehicle.
[01:02:00.262 --> 01:02:14.870]  The West Texas stuff that was a giant multi-billion dollar boondoggle of Obama that made a lot of money for Boone, Pickens, and other people, it loses over 60 to 70 percent of the power in the 400 mile journey.
[01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:15.711]  Pretty incredible, huh?
[01:02:16.664 --> 01:02:18.886]  So it's all just a giant joke.
[01:02:18.886 --> 01:02:26.672]  A windmill will never produce the amount of energy of the carbon it took just to make those big giant things in their lifetime.
[01:02:26.672 --> 01:02:27.452]  You can look this up.
[01:02:27.452 --> 01:02:28.693]  You hear what I just said?
[01:02:28.693 --> 01:02:31.815]  Those windmills, break in a couple years on average, gotta be replaced.
[01:02:31.815 --> 01:02:38.981]  The amount of carbon it takes to make those giant colossal eyesores is more energy than it'll ever produce.
[01:02:42.133 --> 01:02:51.561]  But it's a scam, though, and the globalists run their own little companies while they tell you, oh, we're cutting your fuel off to save the Earth, wink, wink, while they block all the real technologies.
[01:02:51.561 --> 01:02:55.544]  Zero point, all of it's real.
[01:02:55.544 --> 01:02:59.708]  Yep, Toyota's chief says electric vehicles are overhyped.
[01:02:59.708 --> 01:03:02.951]  Unaffordable for average people.
[01:03:02.951 --> 01:03:05.553]  And he goes on to admit that they use just as much carbon or more.
[01:03:07.188 --> 01:03:10.969]  Now, if you want one and you think they're cool, there's some really cool electric cars out there.
[01:03:10.969 --> 01:03:14.929]  And boy, I wish they'd make cars that cool for gas, because there's some cool stuff.
[01:03:14.929 --> 01:03:21.110]  Chevy, the Mustang, the Teslas are beautiful cars.
[01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:22.791]  There's a lot of cool new electric vehicles.
[01:03:22.791 --> 01:03:28.212]  It's just, it takes too long to charge them.
[01:03:28.212 --> 01:03:29.872]  And when they break, you got big problems.
[01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:32.592]  And almost all the parts are made overseas.
[01:03:32.592 --> 01:03:35.753]  And it's just a screw job.
[01:03:35.753 --> 01:03:36.833]  It's a screw job.
[01:03:38.488 --> 01:03:51.023]  Here's Biden talking about how we need to get on the green train to fix the gas prices, which they said they were going to raise prices so high on fossil fuels that it'll bankrupt these, which is their plan.
[01:03:51.023 --> 01:03:52.145]  Here it is.
[01:03:52.145 --> 01:03:53.967]  This crisis is a stark reminder.
[01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:59.022]  To protect our economy over the long term, we need to become energy independent.
[01:03:59.022 --> 01:04:06.270]  I've had numerous conversations over the last three months with our European friends about how they have to wean themselves off of Russian oil.
[01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:10.094]  It's just not tenable.
[01:04:10.094 --> 01:04:13.017]  It should motivate us to accelerate the transition of clean energy.
[01:04:13.533 --> 01:04:15.354]  You know what bankrupted?
[01:04:15.354 --> 01:04:17.216]  They don't deny it, economists don't.
[01:04:17.216 --> 01:04:20.498]  Spain went all in 15 years ago on green energy.
[01:04:20.498 --> 01:04:23.700]  Shut down all their coal plants, shut down a bunch of other systems.
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.541]  Hell, they're even going for natural gas now all over the world.
[01:04:25.541 --> 01:04:27.863]  It's been shut down here, totally clean.
[01:04:27.863 --> 01:04:28.984]  And they just said, nope!
[01:04:30.031 --> 01:04:32.012]  And they shut them down and now Spain's over.
[01:04:32.012 --> 01:04:36.735]  Spain's got 40-something percent unemployment and young people, 20-something percent in the general public.
[01:04:36.735 --> 01:04:38.536]  It's an absolute hellhole.
[01:04:38.536 --> 01:04:39.617]  And that's what the communists do.
[01:04:39.617 --> 01:04:40.958]  They want control.
[01:04:40.958 --> 01:04:42.099]  They want you poor.
[01:04:42.099 --> 01:04:44.660]  They want to dictate the terms of your surrender.
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:46.121]  That's the new world order.
[01:04:46.121 --> 01:04:47.282]  Feudalism.
[01:04:47.282 --> 01:04:48.083]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:48.083 --> 01:04:48.483]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.693 --> 01:05:02.854]  Two of our best-selling products are back in stock.
[01:05:02.854 --> 01:05:04.634]  Themfulwarestore.com.
[01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:09.855]  And they will sell out in the next three, four months before I get more of the product in if I sell it at full price.
[01:05:09.855 --> 01:05:18.537]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting Winter Sun or getting X3 to try the products and see how amazing they are.
[01:05:18.537 --> 01:05:22.398]  And I believe you will then get hooked on them like myself and my family.
[01:05:22.838 --> 01:05:23.079]  We're good.
[01:05:37.455 --> 01:05:41.616]  This is your chance to get X3 and experience the good halogens versus the bad halogens.
[01:05:41.616 --> 01:05:46.518]  This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune system as well.
[01:05:46.518 --> 01:05:48.699]  They're amazing and they're at InfoWars4.com.
[01:05:48.699 --> 01:05:53.140]  And the reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation.
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:54.901]  I need funds to run the operation.
[01:05:54.901 --> 01:05:55.781]  You need to be healthy.
[01:05:55.781 --> 01:05:57.002]  We need to stay on air.
[01:05:57.002 --> 01:05:57.962]  It's a match made in heaven.
[01:06:09.421 --> 01:06:13.985]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:06:13.985 --> 01:06:15.927]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:15.927 --> 01:06:17.589]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:27.618]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:27.618 --> 01:06:29.900]  Does Ukraine have chemical or biological weapons?
[01:06:32.219 --> 01:06:48.687]  Ukraine has biological research facilities, which in fact we are now quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of.
[01:06:48.687 --> 01:06:51.888]  So we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can
[01:06:52.619 --> 01:06:55.402]  I'm sure you're aware that the Russian propaganda...
[01:07:04.244 --> 01:07:13.849]  Two groups are already putting out there all kinds of information about how they've uncovered a plot by the Ukrainians to release biological weapons in the country and with NATO's coordination.
[01:07:13.849 --> 01:07:22.833]  If there's a biological or chemical weapon incident or attack inside of Ukraine, is there any doubt in your mind that 100% it would be the Russians that would be behind it?
[01:07:22.833 --> 01:07:33.139]  There is no doubt in my mind, Senator, and it is classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy what they're planning to do themselves.
[01:07:33.139 --> 01:07:33.719]  Last question.
[01:07:38.143 --> 01:07:42.828]  All right, one of our longest-running guests, over 23 years or so he's been coming on.
[01:07:42.828 --> 01:07:54.140]  Joel Skousen is a former Marine Corps Naval Aviator, Marine Corps Officer, best-selling author, researcher, the top secure home builder in the world, they say, and a good friend of mine.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:58.284]  And he is not a big fan of the Ruskies and trusted about as far as
[01:07:58.925 --> 01:08:00.046]  He can throw them.
[01:08:00.046 --> 01:08:08.754]  So I wanted to get him on with his perspective on, I see China being a big beneficiary of all this and world leaders are now refusing to talk to Biden.
[01:08:08.754 --> 01:08:13.438]  The Wall Street Journal reports they're now confirming these labs in Russia while trying to deny that.
[01:08:14.312 --> 01:08:18.254]  Previously, Biden's cavalier attitude about let them eat cake.
[01:08:18.254 --> 01:08:19.635]  Yeah, your gas prices are going up.
[01:08:19.635 --> 01:08:21.976]  Just get used to it.
[01:08:21.976 --> 01:08:33.782]  Senate hearings where Pentagon experts are warning that Putin may launch a preemptive nuclear strike and vaporize a Ukrainian city to make them capitulate, a la Hiroshima and Nagasaki 1945.
[01:08:33.782 --> 01:08:36.303]  There is a lot to get into here, Joel.
[01:08:36.303 --> 01:08:38.724]  Worldoffirstbrief.com, he's the editor over there.
[01:08:38.724 --> 01:08:39.505]  Excellent information.
[01:08:40.689 --> 01:08:52.034]  At the World At First Brief, give us the 35,000 foot view in your opinion, and then where you think this is all going, and then drill into any of these areas you want to get into.
[01:08:52.034 --> 01:08:54.475]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[01:08:54.475 --> 01:09:07.741]  The Russians are rather stalled in Ukraine, even though they have air superiority over the entire country, and they've got by far the largest military on the ground in armor and artillery.
[01:09:08.845 --> 01:09:21.609]  The Ukrainian army is pretty well neutralized at this point, but the big thing the Russians did not count on is the heavy resistance within the cities of the Ukrainian people themselves.
[01:09:21.609 --> 01:09:26.410]  The government gave a lot of AK-47s and other arms.
[01:09:26.410 --> 01:09:32.632]  Russia wanted to walk in and neutralize the Ukrainian military and then
[01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:36.671]  Cut a deal and get them to capitulate.
[01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:38.312]  And that hasn't happened.
[01:09:38.312 --> 01:09:44.554]  And Ukraine, fortunately, is refusing their negotiated settlement with the Russians.
[01:09:44.554 --> 01:09:49.316]  But the Russians clearly wanted this over with very, very quickly with very few civilian casualties.
[01:09:49.316 --> 01:09:51.316]  Now that's all out the window.
[01:09:51.316 --> 01:10:00.760]  In fact, in order to push Zelensky into agreeing to demilitarize, remember, this is not just, you know, give up and be a neutral and not join NATO.
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:09.688]  He wants Ukraine completely demilitarized, either by destroying the military or by them voluntarily saying, we give up and let you take over the entire military.
[01:10:09.688 --> 01:10:13.692]  Now, no country would really want to do that, obviously.
[01:10:13.692 --> 01:10:17.415]  And so now, you know, Putin has started leveling cities.
[01:10:17.415 --> 01:10:24.522]  Mariupol and Kharkiv have been mostly leveled now, a tremendous amount of damage and destruction in those cities.
[01:10:24.522 --> 01:10:25.343]  So the civilian
[01:10:26.468 --> 01:10:31.233]  Population is being, you know, contrary to what he said, I'm not going to harm civilians.
[01:10:31.233 --> 01:10:35.437]  This is clearly an attack on civilians now.
[01:10:35.437 --> 01:10:44.866]  And the issue of, you know, Zelensky is calling for more aircraft from NATO, especially the MiG aircraft from Poland.
[01:10:45.515 --> 01:10:54.218]  But this is untenable because there are no airfields to land at or to refuel or to, they've all been blasted by the Russians.
[01:10:54.218 --> 01:11:05.462]  So they'd have to go back to Poland and re-land and be re-armed, etc., which would draw NATO into the conflict, which, as I've said in the World Affairs Brief, neither the U.S.
[01:11:05.462 --> 01:11:11.284]  or NATO want to actually stop Putin from winning this war.
[01:11:11.284 --> 01:11:14.185]  They don't want to get involved, but they are
[01:11:15.223 --> 01:11:35.015]  Successful in making Putin show his hand, that basically he's going to try to take back, this is the first, well not the first, it's the second, Belarus was the first, or Georgia in 2008 was attacked and taken back into the Russian orbit.
[01:11:35.015 --> 01:11:38.758]  And now they want Ukraine back because of all the natural resources they have.
[01:11:39.727 --> 01:11:41.928]  Of course, it's the breadbasket of Russia.
[01:11:41.928 --> 01:11:47.131]  It used to produce most of the nuclear missiles for the Soviet Union.
[01:11:47.131 --> 01:11:47.872]  And the U.S.
[01:11:47.872 --> 01:11:50.773]  put in several biological weapons labs.
[01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:54.776]  I had the chuckle of Victoria Nuland saying that the Ukrainians have these.
[01:11:54.776 --> 01:11:55.516]  These are U.S.
[01:11:55.516 --> 01:11:57.717]  bioweapons labs in Ukraine.
[01:11:57.717 --> 01:11:59.058]  They've got them in Bulgaria.
[01:11:59.058 --> 01:12:02.400]  They've got them in Romania.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:08.924]  Dilyana Detansheva, the very courageous investigative reporter out of Bulgaria, has
[01:12:09.451 --> 01:12:16.395]  Put out a list which I put a link to in Friday's World Affairs Brief of all of the U.S.
[01:12:16.395 --> 01:12:17.195]  weapons labs.
[01:12:17.195 --> 01:12:20.017]  You know, they do this because it's against the law, U.S.
[01:12:20.017 --> 01:12:23.519]  law, and so they put these in the former Soviet states.
[01:12:23.519 --> 01:12:33.785]  But the bigger issue that we're facing here is a crisis within the conservative movement of the United States because
[01:12:34.551 --> 01:12:46.620]  Very few conservatives understand that the Soviet Union faked their own demise in 1989 and 90, that the communists just went underground, that they actually ordered the Berlin Wall to come down.
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:53.805]  They ordered the dictators to, and they even shot Ceausescu and his wife because they wouldn't step down.
[01:12:53.805 --> 01:12:59.889]  They told Eric Honecker, you know, to let the riots go forth and the student riots in Leipzig.
[01:13:00.754 --> 01:13:07.756]  And even the Russians who were parading around in Moscow Square in support of Yeltsin were looking around and saying to themselves, where are the KGB?
[01:13:07.756 --> 01:13:11.858]  Normally they're always over us and arresting.
[01:13:11.858 --> 01:13:14.478]  And so Americans don't understand this.
[01:13:14.478 --> 01:13:15.979]  Conservatives don't understand this.
[01:13:15.979 --> 01:13:21.381]  They think Reagan won the Cold War by causing the collapse of the Soviet Union.
[01:13:21.381 --> 01:13:22.201]  And it isn't true.
[01:13:22.972 --> 01:13:33.416]  The Soviet, the communists went underground and faked their own demise in order to get Western aid and trade, which has helped them regain military dominance throughout the world.
[01:13:33.416 --> 01:13:45.820]  And so without this understanding, without the understanding that Putin is following on in this great grand deception of faking their own demise, they think number one, he's a Christian, which he is not.
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:50.022]  You don't get to be a Colonel in the KGB by being a dedicated Christian.
[01:13:50.022 --> 01:13:50.482]  Number two.
[01:13:51.195 --> 01:13:55.198]  That he is fighting against globalism.
[01:13:55.198 --> 01:13:59.341]  Well, to a certain extent he is, but only in a very limited sense.
[01:13:59.341 --> 01:14:05.787]  Because even in Syria, for example, even though he's understood that the U.S.
[01:14:05.787 --> 01:14:19.798]  created ISIS and Al-Qaeda and other terrorists and things, and he exposed that, and they're lining up at the Turkish border to sell ISIS oil, protected by the U.S., he never has come out verbally and attacked the U.S.
[01:14:19.798 --> 01:14:20.138]  for this
[01:14:20.939 --> 01:14:21.079]  Yeah.
[01:14:51.425 --> 01:15:01.729]  At the mainstream media, after so many years of covering for Russia, and they're still covering to a large extent for China, and not attacking them.
[01:15:01.729 --> 01:15:10.892]  Ever since Donald Trump was elected, they came out early and started to link, you know, Russia improperly with election fraud or collusion with Donald Trump.
[01:15:10.892 --> 01:15:13.392]  And it was totally made up.
[01:15:13.392 --> 01:15:20.895]  But I've long said in the World Affairs Brief, I told my subscribers that when you watch the globalists,
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:31.323]  Instead of covering for the Soviet Union and the fall, which they did, they could have seen the phony fall just like I did, but they refused to, they wanted to let it go.
[01:15:32.171 --> 01:15:33.652]  So that they could give that aid and trade.
[01:15:33.652 --> 01:15:35.472]  Remember, they're building weapons.
[01:15:35.472 --> 01:15:37.893]  They're building future enemies in Russia and China.
[01:15:37.893 --> 01:15:38.954]  Joel Skousen, stay there.
[01:15:38.954 --> 01:15:40.915]  We're going to come back with this key point from your perspective.
[01:15:40.915 --> 01:15:43.075]  You've been saying this for a long time.
[01:15:43.075 --> 01:15:47.877]  And that when we saw the West then turn against Russia, that meant something big was about to happen.
[01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:49.678]  We're entering a new phase of all this.
[01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:54.280]  We'll come right back and look at so many angles and where you think this is going to go next.
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:54.740]  Straight ahead.
[01:15:58.399 --> 01:16:03.643]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022.
[01:16:03.643 --> 01:16:22.475]  And in the month of February, we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product X3 that has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much.
[01:16:22.475 --> 01:16:26.378]  And the majority of the population in the world is iodine deficient.
[01:16:26.378 --> 01:16:27.859]  This is the very best iodine out there.
[01:16:28.579 --> 01:16:32.500]  We had it on sale at 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have.
[01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:36.421]  More isn't going to come in for a long time, so I took it back to full price.
[01:16:36.421 --> 01:16:37.982]  And I was just thinking, you know what?
[01:16:37.982 --> 01:16:40.342]  We need the funds in now to stay on air.
[01:16:40.342 --> 01:16:42.723]  Plus, this is a great product everybody needs.
[01:16:42.723 --> 01:16:52.266]  So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience it for yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out.
[01:16:52.266 --> 01:16:55.627]  Get X3 right now exclusively at Infowarestore.com for 50% off.
[01:16:58.846 --> 01:17:05.390]  I stay on air selling high quality products that you need, that you want, and that you're going to be happy with.
[01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:08.412]  That's why you come back and buy products from me again.
[01:17:08.412 --> 01:17:10.233]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[01:17:10.233 --> 01:17:17.098]  I promote liberty, I promote freedom, I fight the globalists, and I'm able to do that because you buy products at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:17:17.098 --> 01:17:18.619]  And listen, all the products are great.
[01:17:19.019 --> 01:17:29.482]  But when it comes to high-quality storable food in an inflationary system with major supply chain breakdowns, this is an absolute 360 win, a no-brainer.
[01:17:29.482 --> 01:17:32.842]  And they've got high-quality storable food ready to ship to you right now.
[01:17:32.842 --> 01:17:37.744]  The great folks at My Patriot's Supply exclusively at PrepareWithAlex.com discounted.
[01:17:37.744 --> 01:17:41.504]  So again, beat inflation, be prepared, fund the InfoWar.
[01:17:41.504 --> 01:17:47.746]  The only way you lose is not taking action at InfoWarStore.com or PrepareWithAlex.com right now.
[01:17:48.046 --> 01:17:49.467]  This is high quality, storable food.
[01:17:49.467 --> 01:17:51.448]  This is how you beat inflation.
[01:17:51.448 --> 01:17:52.209]  Get yours today.
[01:17:52.209 --> 01:17:53.190]  It's ready to ship.
[01:17:53.190 --> 01:17:57.433]  But I wouldn't wait because prices are about to go up because inflation is exploding.
[01:17:57.433 --> 01:18:00.355]  It has been noted by many a historian.
[01:18:00.355 --> 01:18:03.017]  The first casualty of war is the truth.
[01:18:03.817 --> 01:18:08.559]  Then the next big casualty isn't even the people that die.
[01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:10.659]  No, that invariably follows.
[01:18:10.659 --> 01:18:18.962]  But first, there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty, and speech, and massive censorship.
[01:18:18.962 --> 01:18:25.304]  And now, across the world, from the United States to Europe, legislation's being introduced that if you
[01:18:26.464 --> 01:18:31.325]  Amplify any, quote, pro-Russian information.
[01:18:31.325 --> 01:18:35.947]  You can be censored, you can be arrested, you can be in prison.
[01:18:35.947 --> 01:18:48.050]  And of course now, Canada's introduced legislation that if you have a fraught crime, and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online, that you will be censored and arrested.
[01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:54.575]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity.
[01:18:54.575 --> 01:18:57.637]  That makes InfoWars.com more important than ever.
[01:18:57.637 --> 01:19:04.623]  Experience the next level in high-powered energy nootropics with our latest brain force offering, Brain Force Ultra.

[01:19:14.411 --> 01:19:19.973]  A variety of toxic additives, each ingredient is specifically selected for its many key properties.
[01:19:19.973 --> 01:19:32.056]  Some of the proprietary super-ingredients behind Brain Force Ultra include Gorana Seed, which is loaded with energy compounds and antioxidants that have been used by Amazonian tribes for centuries.
[01:19:32.056 --> 01:19:37.878]  Alpha-GPC, a natural compound found in the brain that delivers an essential nutrient, Choline.
[01:19:37.878 --> 01:19:41.979]  And Ginkgo Leaf, which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant content.
[01:19:42.239 --> 01:19:48.365]  This product is more than twice the servings of our Brain Force Plus as well, so you know it's packed full of the good stuff.
[01:19:48.365 --> 01:20:00.176]  Destroy that brain fog today and secure your bottle of Brain Force Ultra before it is completely sold out at m4store.com.
[01:20:00.176 --> 01:20:06.062]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:16.407 --> 01:20:29.881]  Alright, we're talking about the geopolitical realities.
[01:20:29.881 --> 01:20:32.203]  We're getting Phil Scouser's perspective on things.
[01:20:32.203 --> 01:20:33.164]  He's a smart guy.
[01:20:35.285 --> 01:20:39.887]  But I look at World War II and I see how Hitler and Stalin had a deal and then they broke that.
[01:20:39.887 --> 01:20:42.248]  Hitler did with Operation Barbarossa.
[01:20:42.248 --> 01:20:44.588]  And he thought Stalin was about to break the deal.
[01:20:44.588 --> 01:20:53.692]  And I know that Joel was on with us, you know, last time saying he thinks that Zelensky was basically a double agent with the Russians.
[01:20:53.692 --> 01:20:56.353]  I wonder what his perspective is on that now.
[01:20:56.353 --> 01:20:59.554]  I'm not saying he's wrong and I'm not lionizing Putin.
[01:20:59.554 --> 01:21:00.814]  I know he was like the head of the KGB in
[01:21:03.766 --> 01:21:08.031]  Large areas like East Berlin, and that's a very important position.
[01:21:08.031 --> 01:21:13.238]  He had major interfaces with the CIA and the globalists.
[01:21:13.238 --> 01:21:20.827]  And I know that he's a graduate of the Debo School, the class of 93, that first class that Merkel
[01:21:21.904 --> 01:21:22.244]  I don't
[01:21:45.370 --> 01:21:45.550]  for me
[01:22:00.603 --> 01:22:00.843]  Let's
[01:22:16.799 --> 01:22:17.459]  Thank you very much.
[01:22:35.965 --> 01:22:59.405]  I see the global technocrats seeding the communist Chinese and seeding the communist Russians, and I understand they're real power blocs, I agree with Joel, that are then struggling against the West, but out of that Hegelian dialectic of synthesis, the West uses that tyranny to build its own tyranny in the name of countering that tyranny, and then finally uses that huge KGB-style apparatus against the Christians here in this country.
[01:22:59.405 --> 01:23:04.189]  But you got cut off by the break, Joel Scowls, in a WorldAffairsBrief.com, and you were getting to the big point.
[01:23:06.462 --> 01:23:18.105]  Well, it's a complex situation because, first of all, because of the phony fall of the Soviet Union, of the communists going underground, you know, Putin claiming to be an anti-communist, you can't trust that.
[01:23:18.105 --> 01:23:20.226]  You can't trust his claims to be a Christian.
[01:23:20.226 --> 01:23:28.068]  You know, it's very naive of Christians to say, you know, Bill Clinton claiming to be a Christian, and they don't believe it.
[01:23:28.068 --> 01:23:30.529]  Or Joe Biden.
[01:23:30.529 --> 01:23:34.570]  Or Obama, or Joe Biden, all these people claiming, and they don't believe it, but when Putin says,
[01:23:35.327 --> 01:23:39.930]  I'm a Christian, you know, they believe it because they want to have a savior.
[01:23:39.930 --> 01:23:43.111]  They want somebody to come in and save us from our globalists.
[01:23:43.111 --> 01:23:45.773]  But I'll tell you this, Putin is not the savior.
[01:23:45.773 --> 01:23:51.556]  Putin has his own set of weapons of mass destructions and they're not being built for defensive purposes.
[01:23:51.556 --> 01:23:53.637]  These are purely offensive nuclear weapons.
[01:23:53.637 --> 01:23:58.000]  And believe me, this war is not going to start with the United States through Ukraine.
[01:23:58.707 --> 01:24:05.930]  Well, I want you to talk about different war scenarios and these Pentagon drills of a billion people dying in a scenario starting in Ukraine.
[01:24:05.930 --> 01:24:07.771]  But before we do that, you got caught up on the break.
[01:24:07.771 --> 01:24:14.774]  You were saying, when you see the West turn against Russia, when they've been propping it up forever, that means big stuff's about to happen.
[01:24:14.774 --> 01:24:16.855]  You've talked about this for decades.
[01:24:16.855 --> 01:24:18.855]  What are we seeing?
[01:24:18.855 --> 01:24:27.619]  Well, I've long said, when they start to attack Russia, it means, first of all, that the war is now getting close, that they want
[01:24:27.984 --> 01:24:30.006]  They want World War 3.
[01:24:30.006 --> 01:24:39.653]  They want a nuclear preemptive strike by Russia and China on US military forces because that's the only thing that drives America to give up sovereignty and join a militarized global government.
[01:24:39.653 --> 01:24:41.335]  COVID doesn't do it.
[01:24:41.335 --> 01:24:42.596]  Only another war does.
[01:24:42.596 --> 01:24:45.158]  And that's why they've been building up these two enemies.
[01:24:45.158 --> 01:24:46.619]  And so this is the danger point.
[01:24:46.619 --> 01:24:47.920]  They're still covering for China.
[01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:50.792]  But, you know, it's just like the Olympics.
[01:24:50.792 --> 01:24:54.456]  You know, they should have pulled out of the Olympics out of protest of all the human rights abuses.
[01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:55.017]  But they didn't.
[01:24:55.017 --> 01:25:01.404]  They just did a diplomatic protest and then went ahead and continued to praise China throughout the Olympics.
[01:25:01.404 --> 01:25:04.347]  But they've absolutely turned against Russia now.
[01:25:04.347 --> 01:25:07.030]  And as I was saying, it is revolting to me.
[01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:08.932]  I look there with utter revulsion.
[01:25:09.492 --> 01:25:20.520]  To see the same media talking heads who lied to us all throughout this COVID pandemic and lied throughout all the years about disarmament and how wonderful it would be, etc.
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:22.541]  and how we can trust the Russians, etc.
[01:25:22.541 --> 01:25:27.925]  And now to have them telling mostly the truth, it doesn't give me any sense of satisfaction at all.
[01:25:27.925 --> 01:25:37.232]  I feel only revulsion that these people are so evil that they can turn and do both sides, both evil and truth, without...
[01:25:38.982 --> 01:25:40.723]  Any flick of conscience whatsoever.
[01:25:40.723 --> 01:25:43.745]  It's just incredibly revolting, Alex.
[01:25:43.745 --> 01:25:47.607]  But unfortunately, most conservatives don't think that deeply.
[01:25:47.607 --> 01:25:48.648]  Most conservatives say,
[01:25:49.537 --> 01:25:52.239]  Look, I can't trust anything in the mainstream media.
[01:25:52.239 --> 01:25:56.122]  If they say that Putin is a bad guy, he must be a good guy.
[01:25:56.122 --> 01:25:58.243]  This is extremely naive.
[01:25:58.243 --> 01:26:01.686]  Well, it's two-dimensional thinking, not even third-dimensional thinking.
[01:26:01.686 --> 01:26:09.271]  But pulling back from that, it almost becomes a Q-type thing, where Putin's part of the secret good side and all this is going on.
[01:26:09.271 --> 01:26:18.938]  And regardless if Russia's changed or Putin's moved more towards the light, whether that's true or not, we can't count on Vladimir Putin to save us.
[01:26:20.595 --> 01:26:23.937]  Well, and we can't trust him to ever tell the truth.
[01:26:23.937 --> 01:26:25.077]  Period.
[01:26:25.077 --> 01:26:26.678]  Get that in your head, conservatives.
[01:26:26.678 --> 01:26:30.841]  You cannot trust Vladimir Putin to ever tell the truth.
[01:26:30.841 --> 01:26:37.104]  He's part of a major, one of the three major conspiracies, worldwide conspiracies.
[01:26:37.104 --> 01:26:39.726]  Number one was the phony fall of the Soviet Union.
[01:26:39.726 --> 01:26:45.108]  Number two was that 9-11 was an attack by Muslims against the United States.
[01:26:45.108 --> 01:26:45.889]  It was deep state.
[01:26:45.889 --> 01:26:47.790]  And number three was this COVID pandemic.
[01:26:48.385 --> 01:26:55.951]  These are global conspiracies that have been bought in by almost 100% of the people, except for the few that understand these things.
[01:26:55.951 --> 01:27:00.515]  But they're going to culminate in a huge World War III, and Ukraine isn't it.
[01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:06.139]  It might be, if the US and NATO were to actually try to stop Putin.
[01:27:06.139 --> 01:27:11.423]  He might start in retaliating with nuclear, but I tell you, he will not use nuclear weapons.
[01:27:11.423 --> 01:27:15.386]  He does not want to use them until China's ready to join with him.
[01:27:15.386 --> 01:27:17.007]  And China's clearly not ready yet.
[01:27:18.086 --> 01:27:22.967]  This is not going to lead to World War III yet, but it is too late to stop now.
[01:27:22.967 --> 01:27:27.928]  And that's why the globalists, albeit a little bit early, have turned against Putin.
[01:27:27.928 --> 01:27:33.470]  And they, and they went early because they had to use Putin as a foil against Donald Trump.
[01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:46.293]  Um, but, uh, anyway, I'm in, in Friday, last Friday's World Affairs Brief, I outlined in some 12 pages, all of the documentation that shows why the conservatives have bought, uh,
[01:27:47.518 --> 01:27:53.821]  bought into this phony idea that Putin is going to save us from the globalists, that he's a good guy.
[01:27:53.821 --> 01:27:59.904]  People, your listeners can get a free copy of that if they just go to World Affairs Briefing, click on Request a Sample.
[01:27:59.904 --> 01:28:10.069]  And the key that I said is, first of all, the right wing or conservative pundits who don't understand the Russian threat are deceived by two things.
[01:28:10.069 --> 01:28:13.511]  Number one is lack of understanding of the
[01:28:15.905 --> 01:28:16.086]  Yes.
[01:28:29.853 --> 01:28:34.016]  Yanukovych of Ukraine was not a Western coup.
[01:28:34.016 --> 01:28:35.637]  Now, the Western had influence there.
[01:28:35.637 --> 01:28:37.959]  They threw billions of dollars.
[01:28:37.959 --> 01:28:39.120]  Joel Stahler, we got to go to break.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.100]  I want to come back and finish with this.
[01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:43.763]  And then there's big developments on the bioweapon lab news.
[01:28:43.763 --> 01:28:47.146]  Just now breaking huge developments on the other side.
[01:28:47.146 --> 01:28:50.308]  This is massive and where we think this is going.
[01:28:50.308 --> 01:28:55.271]  So regardless, folks, what you think about Putin, we need to talk about what's going to happen next and get a lot of predictions here.
[01:28:55.271 --> 01:28:55.672]  Stay with us.
[01:28:58.723 --> 01:29:03.967]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022.
[01:29:03.967 --> 01:29:22.779]  And in the month of February, we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, X3, that has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much.
[01:29:22.779 --> 01:29:26.682]  And the majority of the population in the world is iodine deficient.
[01:29:26.682 --> 01:29:28.163]  This is the very best iodine out there.
[01:29:29.003 --> 01:29:34.708]  We had it on sale at 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or is it going to come in for a long time?
[01:29:34.708 --> 01:29:36.630]  So I took it back to full price.
[01:29:36.630 --> 01:29:38.331]  And I was just thinking, you know what?
[01:29:38.331 --> 01:29:40.673]  We need the funds in now to stay on air.

[01:30:58.422 --> 01:31:05.350]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:11.237]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[01:31:11.237 --> 01:31:17.604]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[01:31:17.924 --> 01:31:25.149]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[01:31:25.149 --> 01:31:35.437]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[01:31:35.837 --> 01:31:44.847]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[01:31:44.847 --> 01:31:51.454]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.

[01:32:44.882 --> 01:32:46.723]  I've given them to my parents as gifts.
[01:32:46.723 --> 01:32:49.125]  Way out in the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work.
[01:32:49.125 --> 01:32:49.946]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1020.
[01:32:49.946 --> 01:32:51.207]  941-955-1020 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:04.063]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:04.063 --> 01:33:05.384]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:05.384 --> 01:33:24.899]  You are listening to an Infowars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:24.899 --> 01:33:28.802]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:33:32.765 --> 01:33:53.631]  I know why, hell, even most Democrats, most Republicans I know, just mainline people, are rooting for the Russians, is we watch the American empire invade all these countries and tell incredible lies, and leave our borders wide open and devalue our currency and tell us how bad our nation is and demoralize us, and then they see another country
[01:33:55.225 --> 01:34:04.613]  And then you think, well, it must be good because the bad media we hate and the Democratic Party we hate, the Republican neocons we hate, they hate that country.
[01:34:04.613 --> 01:34:07.575]  So that country must be good.
[01:34:07.575 --> 01:34:08.676]  I know this.
[01:34:08.676 --> 01:34:15.782]  I know that the Russian people and the people in Eastern Europe are on fire with anti-New World Order, anti-Soros.
[01:34:15.782 --> 01:34:16.662]  And that's real.
[01:34:16.662 --> 01:34:18.284]  And that's a good thing.
[01:34:18.284 --> 01:34:21.426]  Is Putin opportunistically using that?
[01:34:21.426 --> 01:34:22.487]  Whatever.
[01:34:22.487 --> 01:34:24.949]  The point is, is he did lie about invading Ukraine.
[01:34:26.239 --> 01:34:29.154]  And that was one time where just a month ago...
[01:34:30.287 --> 01:34:34.371]  They're talking to the State Department and say, you're in Alex Jones territory, claiming you know they're about to invade.
[01:34:34.371 --> 01:34:40.796]  But no, they have a satellite and a spy seeing the blood being brought up and the ambulances and the troops and the weapons and knew it was real.
[01:34:40.796 --> 01:34:46.862]  So just because our corporate media usually lies, well, sometimes they tell the truth if something like this is happening.
[01:34:46.862 --> 01:34:48.683]  So I get Joel Skousen's point.
[01:34:48.683 --> 01:34:55.950]  Regardless, I want to hit this huge news about world leaders not talking to Biden, where you think he's going, some big breaking news with these
[01:34:56.917 --> 01:34:59.940]  Well, it's hard to tell at this particular time.
[01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:04.545]  All I can tell is that Vladimir Putin is not going to give up.
[01:35:20.166 --> 01:35:24.410]  Ukraine is going to fall because the West is not going to help save it from that.
[01:35:24.410 --> 01:35:25.651]  And by the way, I need to correct you.
[01:35:25.651 --> 01:35:28.534]  I've never said that Zelensky is a double agent for Putin.
[01:35:28.534 --> 01:35:33.658]  In fact, I think he's the only legitimate nationalist Ukrainian president that they've elected.
[01:35:33.658 --> 01:35:35.100]  And that's one of the reasons why Putin chose him.
[01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:35.900]  I misunderstood you.
[01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:41.545]  Going back, who was the one that they claimed they were pro-Ukraine, but you were saying might be a double agent?
[01:35:41.545 --> 01:35:42.186]  Poroshenko.
[01:35:43.587 --> 01:35:43.887]  Yeah.
[01:35:43.887 --> 01:35:51.432]  Poroshenko was the one that the Maidan coup brought into power, and so everyone thought, well, he must be a globalist puppet.
[01:35:51.432 --> 01:35:52.292]  But he wasn't.
[01:35:52.292 --> 01:35:57.455]  He was actually a Putin puppet who was masquerading as pro-Western.
[01:35:57.455 --> 01:35:58.396]  And that was part of the reason.
[01:35:58.396 --> 01:35:59.877]  I'm sorry I conflated that, Joel.
[01:35:59.877 --> 01:36:01.337]  Thanks for correcting it.
[01:36:01.337 --> 01:36:04.019]  So what do you think of Zelensky?
[01:36:04.019 --> 01:36:05.220]  Well, actually, I think he's...
[01:36:06.209 --> 01:36:14.517]  He's somewhat naive, or at least he started out somewhat naive, but he clearly doesn't have a deep state background that all of these others did.
[01:36:14.517 --> 01:36:20.303]  He did have one of the Ukrainian oligarchs who helped fund his campaign.
[01:36:21.028 --> 01:36:24.810]  But he's clearly not a neo-Nazi and he is saying the right things.
[01:36:24.810 --> 01:36:26.851]  He's not fleeing the country.
[01:36:26.851 --> 01:36:28.672]  He is staying and fighting.
[01:36:28.672 --> 01:36:33.994]  He's rallying the people to fight and he's really getting after the West for letting him fall.
[01:36:33.994 --> 01:36:38.817]  I mean, especially after the Russians bombed this hospital and maternity hospital.
[01:36:38.817 --> 01:36:40.257]  A lot of babies and things are dying.
[01:36:40.257 --> 01:36:41.558]  He said, you know, these are war crimes.
[01:36:42.153 --> 01:36:44.595]  And it was really sickening to see the U.S.
[01:36:44.595 --> 01:36:55.344]  start to talk about war crimes against Putin without ever admitting all the war crimes that we did in World War II, bombing all those civilian cities with phosphorus to turn them into firestorms.
[01:36:55.344 --> 01:37:00.288]  I mean, it was just the most criminal acts we ever did in World War II, but we've never been prosecuted.
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:02.901]  Although they're telling the truth.
[01:37:02.901 --> 01:37:04.962]  These are war crimes by Putin.
[01:37:04.962 --> 01:37:10.204]  You know, these are the hypocrites calling the kettle black.
[01:37:10.204 --> 01:37:13.726]  So what I think is we're going to have a war of attrition against the civilians.
[01:37:13.726 --> 01:37:17.508]  And I think it's pretty soon going to get turned on Kiev.
[01:37:17.508 --> 01:37:21.069]  They've not been willing so far to obliterate Kiev.
[01:37:21.069 --> 01:37:22.030]  They want an agreement.
[01:37:22.030 --> 01:37:28.353]  That's why they've been meeting every other day to try to get an agreement, to try to get the Ukrainians to give in and say we've lost.
[01:37:29.413 --> 01:37:31.735]  And I'm afraid we're getting pretty close.
[01:37:31.735 --> 01:37:41.401]  That's why they're upping the civilian deaths to pull on Zelensky to say, look, if you want more of your people to die, then just keep fighting.
[01:37:41.401 --> 01:37:42.321]  Because you can't win.
[01:37:42.321 --> 01:37:44.623]  Let me raise this point.
[01:37:44.623 --> 01:37:48.125]  One thing we know that Putin didn't lie about for sure was that he wasn't going to invade.
[01:37:48.125 --> 01:37:53.869]  And then he masked all those troops from all over ethnic areas of Russia, a lot of them conscripts,
[01:37:54.887 --> 01:37:55.487]  And that's
[01:38:11.878 --> 01:38:14.520]  Ukraine, they lied to us.
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:18.222]  So now we know that Putin did lie to his troops.
[01:38:18.222 --> 01:38:23.746]  Usually the U.S., even with false pretenses, will brainwash the troops for a year or two before they invade somewhere.
[01:38:23.746 --> 01:38:24.627]  They'll believe it.
[01:38:24.627 --> 01:38:30.691]  That's quite the tactic, not to have large parts of your military not know you're about to invade your neighbor.
[01:38:30.691 --> 01:38:33.012]  Yeah, absolutely true, Alex.
[01:38:33.012 --> 01:38:38.256]  He never put in his first line troops into this invasion, and that's one of the reasons why it has stalled.
[01:38:38.786 --> 01:38:41.749]  But believe me, he's got an awful lot of first line stuff available.
[01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:43.190]  He is reluctant to show it.
[01:38:43.190 --> 01:38:44.691]  He doesn't want the U.S.
[01:38:44.691 --> 01:38:45.312]  eavesdropping.
[01:38:45.965 --> 01:38:48.347]  On his top of the line weapons and what they can do.
[01:38:48.347 --> 01:38:55.992]  And that's why you're going to see people like Colonel McGregor, Doug McGregor, getting on Fox News and talking to Carlson about how the Russian military is weak.
[01:38:55.992 --> 01:39:00.015]  And this proves that they can't even conquer a country like Ukraine.
[01:39:00.015 --> 01:39:01.636]  Don't believe it.
[01:39:01.636 --> 01:39:06.839]  Russia's got a very, very powerful conventional military and they aren't even using half of it.
[01:39:06.839 --> 01:39:14.024]  You know, they're using conscripts, they're using second line people, they're using T-72s and T-80 tanks instead of the new Armata tanks.
[01:39:14.650 --> 01:39:15.531]  What does China do?
[01:39:15.531 --> 01:39:18.113]  I agree with you.
[01:39:18.113 --> 01:39:18.914]  What does China do with Taiwan?
[01:39:40.805 --> 01:39:55.425]  I think China is still going to attack Taiwan and clearly China has taken a great deal of positive feeling from the fact that the West is not going to intervene in Ukraine or NATO in Ukraine and that's a signal to China that we won't intervene.
[01:39:55.925 --> 01:39:57.707]  If you take Taiwan as well.
[01:39:57.707 --> 01:40:07.495]  And doesn't it look like the horrible exit out of Afghanistan, which were for exiting, but was done perfectly to collapse it, was almost to entice Russia to do this.
[01:40:07.495 --> 01:40:11.939]  And now what we're doing with Russia is enticing China to go into Taiwan.
[01:40:11.939 --> 01:40:17.703]  And China also was enticed by the Afghanistan pullout saying, look, you can't trust the Americans.
[01:40:17.703 --> 01:40:22.007]  They betrayed the Afghani people after claiming that they would protect them.
[01:40:22.007 --> 01:40:22.928]  So it was a double
[01:40:23.707 --> 01:40:29.848]  A signal given to both the major predator powers, Russia and China, that we will not defend these countries.
[01:40:29.848 --> 01:40:34.729]  And to a certain extent, you see, the globalists want Russia to show their aggressive hand.
[01:40:34.729 --> 01:40:37.550]  They want China to show their aggressive hand.
[01:40:37.550 --> 01:40:45.512]  So when World War III comes along, it won't be difficult to paint Russia and China as the two predator states that the U.S.
[01:40:45.512 --> 01:40:47.832]  media has protected us from seeing.
[01:40:47.832 --> 01:40:50.833]  And you have been predicting this for over 20 years.
[01:40:50.833 --> 01:40:51.453]  In closing,
[01:40:52.409 --> 01:41:02.651]  Real fast, and I'm going to come back after you're gone to get more into this, but we now have Victoria Nuland admitting they have all these labs, 300 plus worldwide, dozens in Ukraine, dozens more in Eastern Europe.
[01:41:02.651 --> 01:41:06.312]  Turns out that Hunter Biden's Rosemont Seneca invested in it.
[01:41:06.312 --> 01:41:07.332]  That's all confirmed.
[01:41:07.332 --> 01:41:10.652]  And then we have articles going back to 2005, U.S.
[01:41:10.652 --> 01:41:13.753]  to aid Ukraine in countering bioweapons.
[01:41:13.753 --> 01:41:17.314]  Obama setting up bioweapon labs there, Washington Post.
[01:41:17.314 --> 01:41:18.894]  And then the media trying to deny this.
[01:41:19.634 --> 01:41:23.104]  For weeks and then now going okay and admitting it.
[01:41:23.104 --> 01:41:25.891]  Why do you think this is all coming out now and what does this signify?
[01:41:27.183 --> 01:41:29.565]  Well, it's being exposed.
[01:41:29.565 --> 01:41:32.887]  That's why Vic Norley said these were the Ukrainian labs.
[01:41:32.887 --> 01:41:34.708]  It's just a pure lie.
[01:41:34.708 --> 01:41:38.930]  So the globalists are still protecting themselves even as they're attacking Russia.
[01:41:38.930 --> 01:41:44.373]  But the Russians are going to gain control of all these weapons labs and all the research that they're doing there.
[01:41:44.373 --> 01:41:47.675]  There's no way to keep that out of Russian hands right now.
[01:41:47.675 --> 01:41:53.659]  But you see, remember, Russia has their own set of illegal bioweapons labs all throughout Siberia.
[01:41:54.179 --> 01:41:58.001]  And that's one of the reasons why they haven't been blowing a whistle on the U.S.
[01:41:58.001 --> 01:42:05.384]  because the whistle would be blown in reverse against Russia cheating on the bioweapons stuff in Siberia as well.
[01:42:05.384 --> 01:42:08.406]  So these are both evil empires that we're dealing with.
[01:42:08.406 --> 01:42:09.926]  Do you buy the BS that the U.S.
[01:42:09.926 --> 01:42:11.267]  doesn't have hypersonic missiles?
[01:42:11.267 --> 01:42:13.228]  Because I remember seeing them being developed in the 80s.
[01:42:13.228 --> 01:42:15.529]  I see the Air Force third missile test fail.
[01:42:15.529 --> 01:42:17.790]  Does Russia really have better hypersonic missiles than us?
[01:42:18.857 --> 01:42:21.718]  They do, and China does as well.
[01:42:21.718 --> 01:42:25.439]  We're playing catch up with hypersonic missiles, but that's not the whole game.
[01:42:25.439 --> 01:42:32.202]  You know, the ballistic missiles with maneuvering warheads are still much more up of a powerful factor than the hypersonic missiles.
[01:42:32.202 --> 01:42:37.224]  They're really a danger to our naval forces out there in the sea, but the ICBM,
[01:42:38.752 --> 01:42:46.736]  You know, the Russians have about a three times greater capacity to hurt us with ICBMs than the U.S.
[01:42:46.736 --> 01:42:47.376]  does.
[01:42:47.376 --> 01:42:47.696]  All right.
[01:42:47.696 --> 01:42:49.957]  Joel Skalzin, WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[01:42:49.957 --> 01:42:50.657]  Thank you so much.
[01:42:50.657 --> 01:42:53.378]  Look forward to speaking to you again, and hopefully we don't have World War III.
[01:42:53.378 --> 01:42:53.819]  God bless.
[01:42:53.819 --> 01:42:54.979]  All right.
[01:42:54.979 --> 01:42:56.120]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:56.400]  All right.
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:56.720]  We'll be back.
[01:42:58.217 --> 01:43:01.078]  That has been noted by many a historian.
[01:43:01.078 --> 01:43:04.579]  The first casualty of war is the truth.
[01:43:04.579 --> 01:43:09.280]  Then the next big casualty isn't even the people that die.
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:11.381]  No, that invariably follows.
[01:43:11.381 --> 01:43:19.684]  But first, there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty, and speech, and massive censorship.
[01:43:19.684 --> 01:43:26.046]  And now, across the world, from the United States to Europe, legislation's being introduced that if you
[01:43:27.186 --> 01:43:32.049]  Amplify any, quote, pro-Russian information.
[01:43:32.049 --> 01:43:36.673]  You can be censored, you can be arrested, you can be imprisoned.
[01:43:36.673 --> 01:43:48.781]  And of course, now, Canada's introduced legislation that if you have a thought crime, and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online, that you will be censored and arrested.
[01:43:49.401 --> 01:43:55.303]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity.
[01:43:55.303 --> 01:44:00.906]  That makes InfoWars.com more important than ever.
[01:44:00.906 --> 01:44:02.986]  Your voice counts.
[01:44:02.986 --> 01:44:08.048]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[01:44:08.048 --> 01:44:10.629]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:12.130]  They know your anger.
[01:44:12.130 --> 01:44:16.932]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[01:45:06.170 --> 01:45:13.340]  After years of being off the shelves, we're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas ever and it's now been reformulated and is even stronger.
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:15.183]  It's Ultimate Bone Broth Plus.

[01:45:28.507 --> 01:45:35.028]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[01:45:35.028 --> 01:45:36.969]  It even tastes better than the last formula.
[01:45:36.969 --> 01:45:39.450]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[01:45:39.450 --> 01:45:44.351]  Again, it has that cutting-edge chicken broth protein isolate powder.
[01:45:44.611 --> 01:45:46.872]  For better flavor and dissolvability.
[01:45:46.872 --> 01:45:51.014]  You're gonna love this and what it does for your joints, what it does for your body, what it does for your bones.

[01:45:58.376 --> 01:46:06.722]  With the world awakening, I think what's important is that we rise to the momentum right now, take advantage of this moment, and I've always had the idea that it's something everybody can do, that every listener can do.
[01:46:06.722 --> 01:46:10.904]  I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to, uh, you know, hang banners over highways.
[01:46:10.904 --> 01:46:15.067]  Imagine a giant banner on a piece of LA land that says, Alex Jones is right.
[01:46:15.067 --> 01:46:18.890]  Infowars.com, or we stand with the truckers, arrest scouts, or whatever.
[01:46:18.890 --> 01:46:21.411]  Brother, I'm so glad you called to elaborate on this.
[01:46:21.411 --> 01:46:27.816]  Yes, now is the time in your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall, or to put a sticker on your car, or
[01:46:28.396 --> 01:46:32.499]  Banner hangs over highways, and it will be a chain reaction.
[01:46:32.499 --> 01:46:34.600]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:35.681]  I have a few ideas.
[01:46:35.681 --> 01:46:38.523]  First of all, Alex Jones is going to be on that farm.
[01:46:38.523 --> 01:46:39.383]  Arrest Fauci.
[01:46:39.383 --> 01:46:40.344]  Arrest Fox Schwab.
[01:46:40.344 --> 01:46:41.385]  The vaccine is poison.
[01:46:41.385 --> 01:46:42.205]  There's tons of things.
[01:46:42.205 --> 01:46:43.106]  I say, keep it short.
[01:46:43.106 --> 01:46:43.666]  Keep it concise.
[01:46:43.666 --> 01:46:44.667]  No, I agree.
[01:46:44.667 --> 01:46:45.648]  Arrest Fauci.
[01:46:45.648 --> 01:46:46.728]  Arrest Bill Gates.
[01:46:46.728 --> 01:46:48.329]  The COVID vax is poison.
[01:46:48.329 --> 01:46:48.770]  Beautiful.
[01:46:48.770 --> 01:46:51.692]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved and we could all be affected.
[01:46:51.692 --> 01:46:53.072]  So, that's what I'm calling about.
[01:46:53.072 --> 01:46:53.993]  God bless you, Chris.
[01:46:53.993 --> 01:46:57.375]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[01:46:57.375 --> 01:46:58.016]  Thank you so much.
[01:46:59.657 --> 01:47:05.564]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:47:34.346 --> 01:47:38.570]  All right, my friends, we have got so much to cover.
[01:47:38.570 --> 01:47:55.483]  I've got a special guest joining us in the first 30 minutes of the next hour to talk about some really empowering, helpful information for millions of Americans and some of the horror stories out there, too, with what the big central banks are up to and what they're trying to bring in.
[01:47:55.483 --> 01:48:03.429]  And then we have another special guest joining us in the fourth hour, and that is the great Mike Adams.
[01:48:04.471 --> 01:48:11.515]  He really predicted over a year ago that they would next cut off the fertilizer, and he has just been on fire nailing it.
[01:48:11.515 --> 01:48:19.120]  So I'm going to co-host with Mike Adams in the fourth hour, and so much more.
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:31.708]  I have had a few crew members come in and hand me emails and, you know, say they disagree with Skousen, and that's why I put microphones in the control room if they ever want to like, hey, pop in my ear and then come on, but nobody ever wants to.
[01:48:33.598 --> 01:48:36.961]  Because I think it's important to challenge folks.
[01:48:36.961 --> 01:48:39.043]  I've known Joel 20 plus years.
[01:48:39.043 --> 01:48:47.390]  His uncle was high-level FBI and was the first person to expose the New World Order plan here in the U.S., even before the John Birch Society.
[01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:48.310]  So I respect him.
[01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:50.012]  I think he believes what he's saying.
[01:48:50.012 --> 01:48:52.214]  I think most of it's true.
[01:48:52.214 --> 01:48:54.696]  But really, a lot of it's perspective.
[01:48:55.706 --> 01:49:05.415]  I'm just saying, people hate our government so much that they're even like, oh, Xi Jinping's standing up, and Xi Jinping's saying no to the New World Order.
[01:49:05.415 --> 01:49:06.716]  And that's true to a certain extent.
[01:49:06.716 --> 01:49:10.160]  He's saying, no, we're going to have three kids now, not one.
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:12.342]  And we're not going to turn our men into women.
[01:49:12.342 --> 01:49:13.623]  Because they know that's a poison.
[01:49:13.623 --> 01:49:18.648]  But China then funds that through four of the six Hollywood production houses they own.
[01:49:20.373 --> 01:49:24.816]  So I know China gains from the US and Russia fighting with each other.
[01:49:24.816 --> 01:49:30.419]  And I'd like to see North Korea and all these places reformed.
[01:49:30.419 --> 01:49:32.100]  That's what I'd like to see.
[01:49:32.100 --> 01:49:34.842]  I'd like to see China reformed, all of it.
[01:49:34.842 --> 01:49:43.668]  But yes, America is run by the most evil crime syndicate on Earth, but that's not our country.
[01:49:43.668 --> 01:49:45.789]  Now, getting back to these bioweapon labs,
[01:49:49.929 --> 01:49:51.770]  This is a big deal.
[01:49:51.770 --> 01:49:57.153]  And again, it's all over Twitter and Instagram and where people are sending me links.
[01:49:57.153 --> 01:49:59.155]  People say, how does Jones know again?
[01:49:59.155 --> 01:50:03.457]  How did he know weeks ago these weapon labs were real?
[01:50:03.457 --> 01:50:05.779]  And then indeed, Russia was telling the truth.
[01:50:05.779 --> 01:50:09.001]  And they were owned by the quote, US.
[01:50:09.001 --> 01:50:13.424]  Because we have articles going back to 2005.
[01:50:18.103 --> 01:50:20.043]  Where they said all this.
[01:50:20.043 --> 01:50:21.724]  To counter the Russian threat, the U.S.
[01:50:21.724 --> 01:50:28.065]  is building these Level 4 labs, where in the name of defense, they can produce weapons, just like what we saw at Wuhan.
[01:50:28.065 --> 01:50:30.746]  So let me show you some of these.
[01:50:30.746 --> 01:50:37.747]  I mean, it's not hard here to know the damn things were built there in the last 15 years.
[01:50:37.747 --> 01:50:39.388]  Here it is, Washington Post.
[01:50:39.388 --> 01:50:39.648]  U.S.
[01:50:39.648 --> 01:50:42.368]  to aid Ukraine in countering bioterrorism.
[01:50:42.368 --> 01:50:42.929]  August 30, 2005, Joe Warrick.
[01:50:47.386 --> 01:50:55.569]  And it says Obama is spending billions to build this network of labs.
[01:50:55.569 --> 01:50:56.830]  Exclusive!
[01:50:56.830 --> 01:51:04.893]  The tail webpage shows Obama led an effort to build a Ukrainian-based biolab handling especially dangerous pathogens.
[01:51:04.893 --> 01:51:08.715]  And it links through the Washington Post article admitting all that.
[01:51:08.715 --> 01:51:13.497]  Documents expose Barack Obama ordered construction of biolabs in Ukraine to create dangerous pathogens.
[01:51:14.755 --> 01:51:16.676]  Here's one out of the San Francisco News.
[01:51:16.676 --> 01:51:18.177]  There's a bunch of these.
[01:51:18.177 --> 01:51:20.238]  Al Gore reports on the secret U.S.
[01:51:20.238 --> 01:51:22.859]  biolabs in Ukraine.
[01:51:22.859 --> 01:51:32.983]  So now that this is coming out, they've gone from saying these labs didn't exist, and that I'm a big liar and all the rest of it, to, OK, they exist, but they're Ukrainian labs.
[01:51:32.983 --> 01:51:35.064]  We're worried the Russians are going to get it and release it.
[01:51:35.064 --> 01:51:39.786]  I mean, come on, people.
[01:51:39.786 --> 01:51:40.867]  Of course, we have the transcript of
[01:51:42.048 --> 01:51:45.871]  Nuland trying to overthrow Ukraine before, and they indeed did that under Obama.
[01:51:45.871 --> 01:51:50.415]  I mean, just look at that satanic woman.
[01:51:50.415 --> 01:51:52.136]  So do I lionize Putin and Russia?
[01:51:52.136 --> 01:51:52.876]  No.
[01:51:52.876 --> 01:51:53.557]  Am I naive?
[01:51:53.557 --> 01:51:53.917]  No.
[01:51:53.917 --> 01:51:56.199]  But are they the ones under attack?
[01:51:56.199 --> 01:51:57.600]  Has Russia been expansionist?
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:58.901]  No.
[01:51:58.901 --> 01:52:01.203]  The globalists running our country have been expansionist.
[01:52:01.203 --> 01:52:03.785]  They're destroying the very nature of our country existing.
[01:52:05.305 --> 01:52:11.067]  And now they can try to get us to support the corrupt occupational government because we fear Russia.
[01:52:11.067 --> 01:52:14.148]  And China is ten times the threat, in my view, that Russia is.
[01:52:14.148 --> 01:52:19.250]  But I have other guests on to give other perspectives because we're not a cult.
[01:52:19.250 --> 01:52:20.090]  It's like Sandy Hook.
[01:52:20.819 --> 01:52:24.421]  We barely ever even covered that in the aggregate, but the Internet didn't think it happened.
[01:52:24.421 --> 01:52:25.081]  People questioned it.
[01:52:25.081 --> 01:52:26.202]  There were some anomalies.
[01:52:26.202 --> 01:52:29.243]  So I had people on that thought it happened and people that didn't think it happened.
[01:52:29.243 --> 01:52:33.465]  People would get mad and say, why are you having a couple of debates about this?
[01:52:33.465 --> 01:52:35.486]  You need to say it didn't happen.
[01:52:35.486 --> 01:52:37.967]  And I said many times, well, I can see how people think that.
[01:52:37.967 --> 01:52:39.008]  We've been lied to so much.
[01:52:39.008 --> 01:52:42.049]  And then it's sued for that so they can get rid of the First Amendment.
[01:52:42.049 --> 01:52:43.830]  It's preposterous, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:44.932 --> 01:52:46.794]  Of course I question Jesse Smollett.
[01:52:46.794 --> 01:52:48.695]  Of course I question a lot of these events.
[01:52:48.695 --> 01:52:50.937]  And it turns out Snake Island didn't happen.
[01:52:50.937 --> 01:52:52.859]  And the ghost of Kiev didn't happen.
[01:52:52.859 --> 01:52:55.201]  And the Russians didn't make the reactor leak.
[01:52:55.201 --> 01:52:57.183]  So, yeah.
[01:52:57.183 --> 01:53:00.926]  And it turns out Biden is involved with his son in the bio labs.
[01:53:00.926 --> 01:53:02.327]  It's right here.
[01:53:02.327 --> 01:53:03.348]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:53:03.348 --> 01:53:04.649]  Here are the letters.
[01:53:04.649 --> 01:53:07.232]  They break it all down.
[01:53:07.232 --> 01:53:10.775]  So yes, we're vindicated again, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:12.458 --> 01:53:15.979]  But it's not hard to be vindicated when it's on record.
[01:53:15.979 --> 01:53:26.402]  They just think that other people don't know how to look up articles from 16, 17 years ago, but we do.
[01:53:26.402 --> 01:53:33.704]  Now I said I would get to this, this segment, but I'm going to hit it at the bottom of the hour.
[01:53:33.704 --> 01:53:38.426]  The January 6th tyranny and where it's going has really
[01:53:39.366 --> 01:53:40.426]  Crystalized.
[01:53:40.426 --> 01:53:44.328]  It's gotten very crystal clear, and it's come to a head.
[01:53:44.328 --> 01:53:45.868]  And it's bad.
[01:53:45.868 --> 01:54:01.333]  And just like I can tell you, when they start faltering with their COVID-19 power grab, they'll announce that the power grab's over, but they'll keep doing it in places where they've got control, like Australia, like Germany, and like South Korea.
[01:54:03.697 --> 01:54:03.937]  I don't know.
[01:54:27.981 --> 01:54:39.074]  I said, as soon as they get enough opposition, they'll claim it's over when it's not over, and then they'll launch a big war and then a cyber attack because they don't even hide what they're planning in their policy reports.
[01:54:40.592 --> 01:54:48.839]  You know, new videos out that's going viral of 2009 where I say they're going to release a virus in lockdown cities and make you wear a mask and track everywhere you go with vaccine passports.
[01:54:48.839 --> 01:54:50.801]  Because that was in previous documents.
[01:54:50.801 --> 01:54:55.245]  But there I am before Lockstep came out in 2011, nailing it.
[01:54:55.245 --> 01:54:57.187]  Because that's all I do is study people.
[01:54:57.187 --> 01:55:02.292]  So let me tell you what's coming up at the bottom of the hour in 35 minutes.
[01:55:02.292 --> 01:55:04.674]  I'm going to tell you the next shoe to drop, and it's bad.
[01:55:06.237 --> 01:55:15.924]  Because they aren't lining up this January 6th thing and saying questioning elections is terror and let's arrest the opposition because they're not planning to do it.
[01:55:15.924 --> 01:55:29.195]  And they're just waiting with these little low-level indictments and things of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers and the rest of it and almost all that's made up BS to target the Republican Party leadership itself.
[01:55:30.171 --> 01:55:32.573]  And make no mistake, that's who the real targets are.
[01:55:32.573 --> 01:55:46.865]  They plan to target the Trump populist movement, the whole leadership of it, and try to have a hot coup in America against a whole class of people that is destined to blow up in their face.
[01:55:46.865 --> 01:55:53.631]  But I just want it on record that I'm not involved in any of this, and if all these groups want to destroy the country and destroy your futures,
[01:55:54.767 --> 01:56:06.011]  I've done my work, I've exposed what's going on, that it's all insane, but I am not going to be drafted politically by their BS and suckered in to conflict in this country.
[01:56:06.011 --> 01:56:08.752]  But believe me, it's coming.
[01:56:08.752 --> 01:56:14.794]  So, my retirement is at hand because they're going to cut the damn power off and stuff.
[01:56:14.794 --> 01:56:21.717]  I mean, people, you need to understand, I'm not telling you all this stuff to try to just, you know, tune in, he's saying wild stuff.
[01:56:21.717 --> 01:56:22.797]  This is where they're
[01:56:24.136 --> 01:56:24.616]  Going.
[01:56:24.616 --> 01:56:30.480]  They've declared questioning elections and lockdowns terrorism.
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:34.102]  And they're training the military to take on the American people.
[01:56:34.102 --> 01:56:38.305]  While they cull the military.
[01:56:38.305 --> 01:56:42.127]  Using critical race theory and the deadly shots to get the smart folks out.
[01:56:42.127 --> 01:56:44.849]  So, this is the end of the republic.
[01:56:44.849 --> 01:56:46.510]  Maybe the political class will wake up.
[01:56:46.510 --> 01:56:48.251]  Maybe some sanity will reign.
[01:56:48.251 --> 01:56:52.133]  But almost like fighting them almost encourages them at this point.
[01:56:52.133 --> 01:56:52.754]  They're mentally ill.
[01:56:53.596 --> 01:56:55.037]  They're satanic.
[01:56:55.037 --> 01:56:56.738]  And we're a cursed country.
[01:56:56.738 --> 01:56:59.320]  And so in ways, we deserve what's about to happen to us.
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:00.681]  I wish it wasn't going to happen.
[01:57:00.681 --> 01:57:02.262]  Maybe God's going to give us a reprieve.
[01:57:02.262 --> 01:57:04.364]  I don't think so.
[01:57:04.364 --> 01:57:06.065]  But we need to stay on air as long as we can.
[01:57:06.065 --> 01:57:10.748]  We need to individually be as healthy and vibrant as we can be.
[01:57:10.748 --> 01:57:13.070]  And that's why everybody needs vitamin D3.
[01:57:13.070 --> 01:57:15.131]  We got great vitamin D3 at 50% off.
[01:57:15.131 --> 01:57:16.432]  That sale's about to end.
[01:57:16.432 --> 01:57:19.254]  Winter sun with the vitamin K. And we've got
[01:57:21.383 --> 01:57:27.888]  X3, the highest quality iodine you're going to find for your immune system, your body, and everything, and it's 50% off.
[01:57:27.888 --> 01:57:31.310]  Even though we won't get more in for months and months and months, I want you to get it because you need it.
[01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.571]  It's 50% off.
[01:57:31.571 --> 01:57:36.194]  It's going to sell out in a week at current sales rates.
[01:57:36.194 --> 01:57:38.296]  Perhaps in the sale on Winter Sun as well.
[01:57:38.296 --> 01:57:39.416]  They're all selling out.
[01:57:39.416 --> 01:57:39.937]  But it's a catch-22.
[01:57:39.937 --> 01:57:42.599]  I need the money in now, so I'm selling it discounted.
[01:57:42.599 --> 01:57:43.579]  Infowarestore.com.
[01:57:48.604 --> 01:57:54.730]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great InfoWars listeners and viewers.
[01:57:54.730 --> 01:58:03.519]  If you will simply get X3 with all three types of good iodine, it will boost your immune system and help everything that goes on in your body at the cellular level.
[01:58:04.259 --> 01:58:05.379]  It will change your life.
[01:58:05.379 --> 01:58:06.540]  It will invigorate you.
[01:58:06.540 --> 01:58:07.720]  It will empower you.
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:10.821]  Almost everyone has iodine deficiency.
[01:58:10.821 --> 01:58:12.421]  Look into it for yourself.
[01:58:12.421 --> 01:58:13.862]  It's the opposite of fluoride.
[01:58:13.862 --> 01:58:16.062]  It's the good halogen.
[01:58:16.062 --> 01:58:19.483]  And then your purchase of X3 funds our operation.
[01:58:19.483 --> 01:58:25.225]  Now a lot of our products have been sold out and never came back in because of lockdowns and supply chain breakdowns.
[01:58:25.225 --> 01:58:27.645]  We were sold out of X3 for a long time.
[01:58:27.645 --> 01:58:28.345]  And I had it on sale.
[01:58:28.345 --> 01:58:28.686]  We're 50% off.
[01:58:28.686 --> 01:58:30.386]  A lot of folks have been getting it.
[01:58:30.526 --> 01:58:31.728]  And I was thinking, you know what?
[01:58:31.728 --> 01:58:35.433]  I'm going to bring it back on sale again, just until it sells out.
[01:58:35.433 --> 01:58:42.724]  Because even though we won't make as much money in the long run, a lot of folks need this product, and we need to get the money from the sales in now to stay on air.
[01:58:42.724 --> 01:58:46.430]  So get your X3 right now at 50% off at infowarestore.com.
[01:58:48.844 --> 01:58:49.424]  So I did it.
[01:58:49.424 --> 01:58:51.685]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[01:58:51.685 --> 01:58:59.226]  I've been training, probably not as much as I should be, but thank goodness for prayer, and thank goodness for InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:58:59.226 --> 01:59:05.027]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some TurboForce to give me that energy I need to get going.
[01:59:05.027 --> 01:59:18.210]  You know, besides the energy, TurboForce, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[01:59:18.610 --> 01:59:22.471]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones Soreless.
[01:59:22.471 --> 01:59:23.691]  I have bad joints.
[01:59:23.691 --> 01:59:24.591]  Thanks, Mom.
[01:59:24.591 --> 01:59:31.672]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[01:59:31.672 --> 01:59:36.113]  The quick-release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[01:59:36.113 --> 01:59:46.935]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, TurboForce, that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day, and Soreless can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[01:59:50.956 --> 01:59:55.441]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:55.441 --> 02:00:03.689]  Big guest coming up next segment.
[02:00:03.689 --> 02:00:07.313]  The first is an incredibly important report.
[02:00:10.569 --> 02:00:12.590]  Where has Dr. Fauci gone?
[02:00:12.590 --> 02:00:15.330]  All of a sudden, the fame-addicted vaccine dictator has disappeared.
[02:00:15.330 --> 02:00:17.951]  Could it have something to do with the 55,000-page set of documents
[02:00:31.155 --> 02:00:44.827]  Recently released by the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, revealing public the data Pfizer submitted to the FDA from its clinical trials in support of a COVID-19 vaccine license.
[02:00:44.827 --> 02:00:48.650]  A big blow to the New World Order plandemic after U.S.
[02:00:48.650 --> 02:00:52.954]  District Judge Mark T. Pittmans denied the request from the FDA
[02:00:53.314 --> 02:00:58.717]  I have frequently said, you know, we're going to lead with the science, science is going to be the foundation of everything we do.
[02:00:58.717 --> 02:00:59.898]  That is entirely true.
[02:01:12.925 --> 02:01:15.988]  The public heard that as science is full proof.
[02:01:15.988 --> 02:01:18.389]  Science is black and white.
[02:01:18.389 --> 02:01:23.853]  Science is immediate and we get the answer and then we, you know, make the decision based on the answer.
[02:01:23.853 --> 02:01:26.375]  And the truth is, science is great.
[02:01:26.375 --> 02:01:28.237]  And science is not always immediate.
[02:01:28.237 --> 02:01:32.280]  And sometimes it takes months and years to actually find out the answer.
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:35.903]  But you have to make, you know, decisions in a pandemic before you have that answer.
[02:01:36.463 --> 02:01:52.190]  A 38-page report included in the documents features an appendix titled, List of Adverse Events of Special Interest, listing 1,291 different adverse events following vaccination.
[02:01:52.190 --> 02:02:01.614]  The list includes acute kidney injury, acute flaccid myelitis, anti-sperm antibody positive, brain stem embolism,
[02:02:02.154 --> 02:02:06.275]  It seems to indicate a break in the veil
[02:02:30.559 --> 02:02:38.886]  That may allow legal action basically due to fraud and concealment of these risks from the general public.
[02:02:38.886 --> 02:02:50.935]  This is why you have not been able to have full informed consent is they've hidden all this information from you and they've used all of the propaganda and censorship tools which you're about to cover.
[02:02:51.741 --> 02:02:57.568]  I'm an epidemiologist and people have asked me, Dr. McCullough, are the vaccines actually causing the deaths?
[02:03:09.488 --> 02:03:16.252]  The epidemiological construct that we have to go through is called the Bradford Hill Tenets of Causality.
[02:03:16.252 --> 02:03:19.274]  So the first question is, is it a large signal?
[02:03:19.274 --> 02:03:21.495]  Is it a large epidemiologic signal?
[02:03:21.495 --> 02:03:23.416]  And I tell you, it's astronomical.
[02:03:23.416 --> 02:03:29.279]  All the vaccines combined in the United States per year, it's no more than 150 deaths, not temporarily related.
[02:03:29.279 --> 02:03:31.120]  Here we are at over 21,000 deaths.
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:33.662]  So clearly it's a massive signal, number one.
[02:03:34.122 --> 02:03:37.263]  Number two, is there a dangerous mechanism of action?
[02:03:37.263 --> 02:03:38.223]  The answer is yes.
[02:03:38.223 --> 02:03:41.764]  Frankly, we know the vaccines have a dangerous mechanism of action.
[02:03:41.764 --> 02:03:44.204]  They install production of the spike protein.
[02:03:44.204 --> 02:03:54.927]  The spike protein is what makes the respiratory infection lethal, and it follows that in some people, excessive production of the spike protein in a vulnerable person would be lethal after a vaccine.
[02:03:54.927 --> 02:03:59.968]  The third criteria is, is it internally consistent?
[02:03:59.968 --> 02:04:00.668]  Are there other
[02:04:01.587 --> 02:04:06.110]  Conditions that are now acknowledged that they themselves could be fatal.
[02:04:06.110 --> 02:04:07.351]  And the answer is sure.
[02:04:07.351 --> 02:04:13.735]  With myocarditis, our FDA agrees, all the regulatory experts agree, that the vaccines cause myocarditis.
[02:04:13.735 --> 02:04:14.556]  Can it be fatal?
[02:04:14.556 --> 02:04:15.156]  Yes.
[02:04:15.156 --> 02:04:17.457]  Have there been fatal cases published?
[02:04:17.457 --> 02:04:18.218]  Yes.
[02:04:18.218 --> 02:04:23.301]  There's over a thousand peer-reviewed papers published on fatal and non-fatal outcomes.
[02:04:23.301 --> 02:04:24.302]  So that criteria is met.
[02:04:24.642 --> 02:04:31.204]  It is beyond any shadow of a doubt that the vaccines are causing large numbers of deaths.
[02:04:31.204 --> 02:04:33.084]  It's unequivocal.
[02:04:33.084 --> 02:04:34.505]  It is unassailable.
[02:04:34.505 --> 02:04:40.907]  Those conclusions, and I'm a card-carrying epidemiologist, I'm telling you, the vaccines are causing large numbers of deaths.
[02:04:40.907 --> 02:04:52.030]  Maybe Dr. Fauci can crawl out of his hole and explain what he knew about the massive list of injuries that he had hoped would only be released long after he was gone.
[02:04:52.030 --> 02:04:53.170]  John Bowne reporting.
[02:04:59.605 --> 02:05:02.488]  Two of our best-selling products are back in stock.
[02:05:02.488 --> 02:05:04.369]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:05:04.369 --> 02:05:09.693]  And they will sell out in the next three, four months before I get more of the product in if I sell it at full price.
[02:05:09.693 --> 02:05:18.279]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting Winter Sun or getting X3 to try the products and see how amazing they are.
[02:05:18.279 --> 02:05:22.142]  And I believe you will then get hooked on them like myself and my family.
[02:05:22.162 --> 02:05:22.703]  We're good.
[02:05:37.179 --> 02:05:41.263]  This is your chance to get X3 and experience the good halogens versus the bad halogens.
[02:05:41.263 --> 02:05:46.248]  This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune system as well.
[02:05:46.248 --> 02:05:48.450]  They're amazing and they're at infowarestore.com.
[02:05:48.450 --> 02:05:52.895]  And the reason it's a 360 win is it funds the operation.
[02:05:52.895 --> 02:05:54.656]  I need funds to run the operation.
[02:05:54.656 --> 02:05:55.537]  You need to be healthy.
[02:05:55.537 --> 02:05:56.759]  We need to stay on air.
[02:05:56.759 --> 02:05:57.720]  It's a match made in heaven.
[02:06:14.435 --> 02:06:26.460]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:30.382]  American Tax Solution is a very well-respected company.
[02:06:30.382 --> 02:06:33.363]  I've had friends and family that have used it.
[02:06:34.549 --> 02:06:41.635]  And I wanted to get them on, just like I have some of these medical doctors on that have telemedicine that are getting people ivermectin.
[02:06:41.635 --> 02:06:45.358]  I like to have guests on that is something that is really, really helpful.
[02:06:45.358 --> 02:06:50.442]  And so I want to get in with them some of the things that they have witnessed.
[02:06:51.980 --> 02:07:14.330]  With the IRS trying to now have access to everybody's bank accounts without warrants and lifetime, with all these central bankers and Biden officials saying that they want to be able to control the money you have and saying they own your money, I've got all these headlines right here because these folks have their ear to the ground and they know what's really going on with the IRS when we hear about
[02:07:15.495 --> 02:07:23.438]  All these tens of thousands of new agents being hired to target working class people, but also nouveau riche.
[02:07:23.438 --> 02:07:27.960]  Some of the folks that are making $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 a year as well.
[02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:33.202]  And so the real horror stories of what's happening on the ground.
[02:07:33.202 --> 02:07:37.363]  And so Tyler Bennett of American Tax Relief is with us.
[02:07:37.363 --> 02:07:41.765]  This is something everybody needs to write down, everybody needs to save and know this because
[02:07:42.830 --> 02:07:44.532]  You can do three things.
[02:07:44.532 --> 02:07:48.595]  You can go hide out in the woods and not pay the taxes.
[02:07:48.595 --> 02:07:53.359]  Or you can try to avert them and maybe get sent to prison or lose your house or business.
[02:07:53.359 --> 02:08:03.328]  Or you can, I guess, just go to the system and get screwed over and not learn the advantages that are out there and the ways the system uses to legally and lawfully avoid most of this BS tax.
[02:08:03.328 --> 02:08:08.693]  And then if you've already gotten in trouble with these people, they can literally talk your bills down
[02:08:10.307 --> 02:08:15.474]  From thousands of dollars to hundreds of dollars, from hundreds of thousands of dollars to thousands of dollars.
[02:08:15.474 --> 02:08:21.181]  But if you try to negotiate with these people, the IRS directly, they will eat your lunch.
[02:08:22.858 --> 02:08:26.119]  There's a lot of these companies out there, but this one's been around a long time.
[02:08:26.119 --> 02:08:27.500]  I have friends and family that have used it.
[02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:36.944]  We've gotten rave reviews, and so I've gone out and approached them and said, I want you to be a sponsor of the show because you have great ratings with the Better Business Bureau.
[02:08:36.944 --> 02:08:40.566]  You've been around a long time, and this is a service I can bring listeners.
[02:08:41.266 --> 02:08:54.473]  That will then fund our operation to get the truth out and will also help people who decide to go the avenue of negotiating with the IRS or also very inexpensive but tried and true ways to also protect yourself.
[02:08:54.473 --> 02:09:05.099]  And so we're very, very excited about all of this information and Tyler Bennett is one of their top tax experts and I appreciate him coming on with us.
[02:09:05.099 --> 02:09:07.300]  So Tyler, thank you so much for coming on with us today.
[02:09:08.539 --> 02:09:11.821]  Hi Alex, great to be here.
[02:09:11.821 --> 02:09:13.321]  Thanks for having me on the show.
[02:09:13.321 --> 02:09:17.764]  Like you said before, there is three things going on at once.
[02:09:17.764 --> 02:09:22.646]  First of all, the globalists are trying to take more and more of your hard-earned money, right?
[02:09:22.646 --> 02:09:34.692]  And so what we can do is, if you're part of that group of people that are making more money than you did last year, you need to make sure that we put you in the right kind of entity so that you don't get screwed over by the globalists.
[02:09:35.232 --> 02:09:45.626]  Likewise, if you're already in a situation where the IRS is coming after you, they're coming after your property, because we know that's what they want to do is take all away of everyone's property.
[02:09:45.626 --> 02:09:48.850]  And so what we can do is we can help you out of that mess.
[02:09:48.850 --> 02:09:52.695]  We can get you back to square one so you don't owe the IRS what you can't afford to pay.
[02:09:53.729 --> 02:09:57.971]  Because Alex, there's three things going on at the same time here, okay?
[02:09:57.971 --> 02:10:12.019]  We have the war with Ukraine, we have the war with the bankers against the people, against your money, and we have the war with the vaccine and the vaccine companies trying to kill people and do all this stuff, right?
[02:10:12.019 --> 02:10:20.123]  And at the end of the day, and you can see it from this Politico news article, the thing that combines
[02:10:21.488 --> 02:10:32.712]  All of these wars is the IRS in taxation, because at the end of the day, the government printed off three trillion dollars, and they need a way to pay for this war, because of inflation.
[02:10:32.712 --> 02:10:37.234]  Absolutely, and what I like about you guys is you're the highest rated firm out there.
[02:10:37.234 --> 02:10:40.575]  There are a few others that are almost as highly rated with the Better Business Bureau and other groups.
[02:10:40.575 --> 02:10:48.978]  People love you guys, you've been around for a long, long time, and you don't just help people that are already in trouble with the IRS negotiate it way down.
[02:10:49.958 --> 02:10:58.925]  You also have a lot of other services for people, and we have a URL where people can go right to your site with all the services and then support this broadcast, the 360Win.
[02:10:58.925 --> 02:11:01.207]  It's jonestaxrelief.com.
[02:11:01.207 --> 02:11:04.930]  One word, jonestaxrelief.com.
[02:11:04.930 --> 02:11:09.754]  Tell folks about all the different great services before we get into some of the current horror stories and what the IRS is up to.
[02:11:10.854 --> 02:11:11.734]  Absolutely.
[02:11:11.734 --> 02:11:17.116]  So Alex, so if you go to Jones Tax Relief right now, we got people standing by to take your call.
[02:11:17.116 --> 02:11:22.018]  But basically, look, if you're already in a mess and you owe the IRS money, that's a problem.
[02:11:22.018 --> 02:11:26.239]  But let's say you are right now in the middle class making more money, small business owner.
[02:11:26.679 --> 02:11:27.639]  We're good to go.
[02:11:44.785 --> 02:11:51.271]  These services to the middle class, to the people, so everybody is paying the least amount of tax as possible.
[02:11:51.271 --> 02:11:58.797]  Why that's important is because you know, Alex, what happens with your tax dollars is a percentage of it's going to fund NATO.
[02:11:58.797 --> 02:12:03.281]  A large percentage is going to fund the Ukrainian war and devalue the US currency.
[02:12:03.281 --> 02:12:04.702]  So here's what we can do.
[02:12:04.702 --> 02:12:08.506]  If you're making money, you need to be in an entity, the proper type.
[02:12:09.206 --> 02:12:13.027]  Uh, you know, whether you need a C-corporation to be put on payroll.
[02:12:13.027 --> 02:12:23.831]  There's all sorts of things that we can do to get you tax lea- uh, excuse me, income, tax-free or paying the least amount of tax as possible legally.
[02:12:23.831 --> 02:12:25.671]  Because there's two things in this world.
[02:12:25.671 --> 02:12:29.272]  There's tax evasion, which is a felony, and you don't want to do that.
[02:12:29.272 --> 02:12:31.033]  Like you previously said, you're going to end up in jail.
[02:12:31.033 --> 02:12:32.013]  And there's tax avoidance.
[02:12:32.353 --> 02:12:39.412]  Which is the exact same thing, but we are using the legal law, the IRC, the Internal Revenue Code, and the loopholes therein.
[02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:42.792]  Typically only reserved for the elitist and globalists.
[02:12:42.792 --> 02:12:54.823]  And that's the key, because explain, like, going back 15 years ago, they passed regulations and laws that made most CPAs and groups scared to actually even tell people the loopholes for legal tax avoidance.
[02:12:54.823 --> 02:12:59.507]  But organizations and groups like yours, you help people actually do it right, and you stand behind it.
[02:12:59.507 --> 02:13:00.388]  That's the key.
[02:13:00.388 --> 02:13:04.732]  When the IRS sees the name of your group on it, they know to take it very, very seriously.
[02:13:05.905 --> 02:13:07.926]  Absolutely, Alex, and here's the difference, okay?
[02:13:07.926 --> 02:13:18.509]  So, when you have a CPA firm, CPAs by their very nature, especially when the government comes out and says, hey, this is how it's going to be and we're not going to accept anything else, they're not advocates.
[02:13:18.509 --> 02:13:23.171]  CPAs are designed to fill out the tax return and play by the rules.
[02:13:23.171 --> 02:13:28.893]  So, when the government, the IRS, comes out and says, hey, these are the new rules, they say, okay, that's the way we're going to play.
[02:13:28.893 --> 02:13:34.595]  We're tax attorneys here, we have CPAs, we have enrolled agents as well, but the difference between them and us is we are advocates.
[02:13:35.131 --> 02:13:42.736]  Just because the IRS is saying something, just because Biden's saying something, that doesn't mean necessarily we can't get around it.
[02:13:42.736 --> 02:13:46.338]  That isn't legally, but of course, and that doesn't mean that it's right.
[02:13:47.912 --> 02:13:59.497]  Well, I cannot stress enough to people that in my 28 years on air being self-funded and self-financed, I wish I knew about the IRS and the real rules 28 years ago what I've learned in the last few years.
[02:13:59.497 --> 02:14:05.079]  We wouldn't even be able to stay on air if we didn't start, you know, basically doing the same research, the same things that you guys are up to.
[02:14:05.079 --> 02:14:08.741]  And I just don't think people realize that this is worth its weight in gold.
[02:14:08.741 --> 02:14:11.662]  It's so affordable, so inexpensive.
[02:14:11.662 --> 02:14:17.385]  If people have an IRS problem, you know, you guys have a formula where it's just insane
[02:14:17.985 --> 02:14:23.188]  On average, how much are you able to lower in a tax bill for people once they're already even in trouble?
[02:14:23.188 --> 02:14:27.210]  It's typically, we're able, so let's say you're in trouble and you owe the IRS 100 grand.
[02:14:27.210 --> 02:14:30.811]  We are typically able to lower that to about 10% or less of what you owe.
[02:14:30.811 --> 02:14:31.692]  So you owe 100 grand.
[02:14:32.503 --> 02:14:35.345]  A typical case, we'd be able to lower that to 10 for you.
[02:14:35.345 --> 02:14:36.906]  I have family that use you guys.
[02:14:36.906 --> 02:14:39.487]  That's why when we were looking, I went, wait a minute, who's my family use?
[02:14:39.487 --> 02:14:40.348]  Who have I heard of before?
[02:14:40.348 --> 02:14:40.888]  Who's the top?
[02:14:40.888 --> 02:14:41.789]  I said, get them.
[02:14:41.789 --> 02:14:46.051]  So I mean, I approached you guys about being a sponsor because you guys are awesome.
[02:14:46.051 --> 02:14:49.413]  And I mean, on average, reducing it to 10%.
[02:14:49.413 --> 02:14:55.397]  But then I've had friends and family that negotiated themselves and maybe got it down 30, 40, 50% maximum.
[02:14:55.397 --> 02:14:57.158]  How are you guys able to do that?
[02:14:57.158 --> 02:15:00.680]  Instead of getting them to cut it in half, you negotiate right to 10%.
[02:15:02.638 --> 02:15:03.339]  100%.
[02:15:03.339 --> 02:15:15.565]  So here's the thing, Alex, is the IRS wants you to represent yourself so that you sign away your rights, you give it up, you consent to what they're doing to you.
[02:15:15.565 --> 02:15:18.306]  Because the people at the IRS are not attorneys, most of them.
[02:15:18.306 --> 02:15:19.587]  They're not even enrolled agents.
[02:15:19.587 --> 02:15:21.928]  They're clerks, and they're handed a rule book.
[02:15:22.348 --> 02:15:23.649]  And they go off of that.
[02:15:23.649 --> 02:15:28.011]  And they may even be breaking the law when they are operating with you.
[02:15:28.011 --> 02:15:37.476]  So of course, they don't want you to give legal representation so you know what your actual rights are and what you're actually obligated to pay as opposed to what they're saying you pay.
[02:15:37.476 --> 02:15:41.899]  Because at the end of the day, remember, the IRS only knows what you or somebody else tell them.
[02:15:42.915 --> 02:15:43.396]  That's right.
[02:15:43.396 --> 02:15:45.119]  JonesTaxRelief.com.
[02:15:45.119 --> 02:15:45.941]  One word.
[02:15:45.941 --> 02:15:47.283]  JonesTaxRelief.com.
[02:15:47.283 --> 02:15:50.990]  They are awesome folks and they've got so many services.

[02:15:54.136 --> 02:15:54.656]  We'll be right back.

[02:16:08.394 --> 02:16:10.115]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[02:16:10.115 --> 02:16:17.098]  I promote liberty, I promote freedom, I fight the globalists, and I'm able to do that because you buy products at InfoWarsaw.com.

[02:16:53.167 --> 02:16:58.809]  But I wouldn't wait, because prices are about to go up, because inflation is exploding.
[02:16:58.809 --> 02:17:08.972]  Whether they were present that day, or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy, we will follow the facts wherever they lead.
[02:17:12.173 --> 02:17:14.353]  The days of independent media are numbered.
[02:17:14.353 --> 02:17:17.894]  The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[02:17:17.894 --> 02:17:20.755]  They are now debanking us behind the scenes.
[02:17:20.755 --> 02:17:24.515]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[02:17:24.515 --> 02:17:32.937]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps, the traitors know they can shut us down by force.
[02:17:32.937 --> 02:17:36.178]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[02:17:36.178 --> 02:17:36.678]  So be it.
[02:17:37.678 --> 02:17:40.061]  Make them silence us by force.
[02:17:40.061 --> 02:17:43.064]  This is the final battle of the information war.
[02:17:43.064 --> 02:17:44.326]  Give now.

[02:17:48.850 --> 02:17:51.713]  We need you to carry us through to the end.
[02:17:51.713 --> 02:17:53.075]  Victory or death.

[02:17:58.371 --> 02:18:06.039]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days, with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[02:18:06.039 --> 02:18:14.607]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, Down and Out, is just the thing.
[02:18:14.607 --> 02:18:20.994]  It's our new, faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[02:18:21.604 --> 02:18:22.445]  We're good to go.
[02:18:40.805 --> 02:18:47.471]  Which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[02:18:47.471 --> 02:18:53.617]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.
[02:18:53.617 --> 02:18:56.039]  Selling out now at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:18:57.660 --> 02:19:08.332]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled.
[02:19:08.332 --> 02:19:16.662]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their laws.
[02:19:17.262 --> 02:19:32.238]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[02:19:32.238 --> 02:19:34.900]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[02:19:35.561 --> 02:19:49.013]  The problem is some globalist-controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover, like Canada, where they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario, and other areas of the world are following suit, like Australia.
[02:19:49.013 --> 02:19:50.855]  So pray for these folks big time.
[02:19:50.855 --> 02:19:52.716]  It's a very serious situation.
[02:19:52.716 --> 02:19:56.400]  And stay tuned in to Infowars.com, because truth is absolutely paramount.
[02:19:59.887 --> 02:20:13.518]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:13.518 --> 02:20:18.822]  I'm no stranger to the rain
[02:20:21.993 --> 02:20:23.895]  Look, I gotta get Tyler Bennett.
[02:20:23.895 --> 02:20:25.736]  I mean, this guy's amazing.
[02:20:25.736 --> 02:20:30.020]  I mean, behind the scenes, our crew and stuff have hung out for a while.
[02:20:30.020 --> 02:20:32.363]  These guys are definitely on board with us.
[02:20:32.363 --> 02:20:37.147]  And that's why it was great when I said, I want one of these good tax companies to advise people on health and good service.
[02:20:37.147 --> 02:20:39.469]  And I remembered this company from Fins and Families.
[02:20:39.469 --> 02:20:40.891]  It's been around for a long, long time.
[02:20:41.491 --> 02:20:49.957]  And that we got this gentleman on, who's their spokesman, and turned out he knows some of my friends and some of the people that we actually work with that are patriots.
[02:20:49.957 --> 02:20:51.678]  So it's a very, very small world.
[02:20:51.678 --> 02:21:01.125]  We've got to do like an hour commercial-free thing with him, too, because he's got these horror stories, what they're currently up to, and the dirty tricks they're running, and the things people need to know.
[02:21:01.125 --> 02:21:08.750]  So you wanted to tell people about these five or six incredible developments that are happening right now, where they admit they're targeting Christians and tell them to their face.
[02:21:09.991 --> 02:21:12.595]  Just all this crazy stuff Joe Biden's doing.
[02:21:12.595 --> 02:21:23.409]  Tell people about what is about to hit us because you were describing this to me that it is just monstrous that as bad as what we see in the news about how they're coming after folks, it's even worse than that.
[02:21:25.103 --> 02:21:25.983]  That's right, Alex.
[02:21:25.983 --> 02:21:34.085]  So, first of all, I want to remind people that the IRS is the world's largest collection agency, and they collect for the globalists, right?
[02:21:34.085 --> 02:21:35.925]  So they have all the power.
[02:21:35.925 --> 02:21:41.366]  And so because of that, it's not even, it's a rigged game, right?
[02:21:41.366 --> 02:21:46.387]  So we look at the true globalists out there, like George Soros hasn't paid taxes in three years.
[02:21:46.387 --> 02:21:50.448]  Michael Bloomberg, you know, pays taxes every other year, has nothing.
[02:21:50.448 --> 02:21:52.529]  Elon Musk, a few years ago, paid nothing in taxes.
[02:21:52.529 --> 02:21:53.449]  The only reason he paid
[02:21:53.849 --> 02:21:56.133]  This year is because he made a billion dollars.
[02:21:56.133 --> 02:21:58.997]  Hey, if you were making a billion dollars, I'm sure you'd pay taxes, too.
[02:21:58.997 --> 02:22:00.819]  See, here's the thing, okay?
[02:22:00.819 --> 02:22:00.940]  Is...
[02:22:01.954 --> 02:22:06.038]  The United States is printed off $3 trillion, right?
[02:22:06.038 --> 02:22:08.600]  And so we're in an inflation, right?
[02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:18.569]  And so the government has two options at that point, raise interest rates and make spending of money harder for everybody, or how convenient that they could actually fund a war.
[02:22:18.569 --> 02:22:24.595]  And the Biden administration just signed a $19 billion check to the Ukrainian war effort.
[02:22:25.155 --> 02:22:36.483]  And so, you know, the thing is, is where, and again, let me hold up this article again, this is all connected, Alex, is that what does the IRS have to do with Russia and Ukraine?
[02:22:36.483 --> 02:22:39.024]  Well, let's talk about gas prices for a second.
[02:22:39.024 --> 02:22:44.808]  You know, here where I live in California, okay, I go out and buy gas for my car, it's $7 a gallon.
[02:22:44.808 --> 02:22:45.569]  And guess what?
[02:22:45.569 --> 02:22:47.570]  There's gas taxes on top of that.
[02:22:47.970 --> 02:22:53.072]  So this is a three-way attack on the people, Alex.
[02:22:53.072 --> 02:23:04.476]  They have devalued our currency, which makes costs and goods and services go up, but because they're funding this war, the government is also buying these costs and goods and services and taxing them.
[02:23:04.476 --> 02:23:13.119]  So that means that the American person is going to get taxed more and have the same amount of money because their wages didn't go up even though it's worth less.
[02:23:13.986 --> 02:23:20.430]  And so these three things combined, raising of prices, raising of taxes, which will happen.
[02:23:20.430 --> 02:23:24.253]  Biden has not been able to- And by the way, Tyler, you're even more animated than I am.
[02:23:24.253 --> 02:23:25.233]  We're two birds with a feather.
[02:23:25.233 --> 02:23:26.054]  Your earpiece fell out.
[02:23:26.054 --> 02:23:26.514]  Yeah.
[02:23:26.514 --> 02:23:27.615]  Please continue.
[02:23:27.615 --> 02:23:28.616]  I saw that about you.
[02:23:28.616 --> 02:23:29.336]  Yeah.
[02:23:29.336 --> 02:23:30.137]  I'm Italian.
[02:23:30.137 --> 02:23:30.977]  I love to talk with my hands.
[02:23:30.977 --> 02:23:32.078]  So, yes.
[02:23:32.478 --> 02:23:33.419]  That's the thing.
[02:23:33.419 --> 02:23:35.841]  It's a trifecta.
[02:23:35.841 --> 02:23:37.922]  Because as you're saying, you know, it's true.
[02:23:37.922 --> 02:23:40.604]  They wanted to value the US currency.
[02:23:40.604 --> 02:23:43.526]  They want to have everybody on the same plane.
[02:23:43.526 --> 02:23:46.909]  They want you to own nothing and be happy about it, right?
[02:23:46.909 --> 02:23:49.531]  We've heard that by 2030, okay?
[02:23:49.531 --> 02:23:51.532]  And that makes me angry, right?
[02:23:51.532 --> 02:23:54.214]  I'm out there saying, hey, look, I am in this world.
[02:23:54.214 --> 02:23:56.476]  I have the American dream like anybody else.
[02:23:56.476 --> 02:23:57.877]  I want to buy property.
[02:23:57.877 --> 02:23:59.478]  And they're saying 10 years from now,
[02:24:00.158 --> 02:24:01.659]  That won't even be a thing, right?
[02:24:01.659 --> 02:24:16.347]  And so what, honestly, I think everybody's duty as a, you know, God-fearing, red-blooded patriot is to pay the least amount of taxes as physically possible because that is what they're using.
[02:24:16.347 --> 02:24:22.610]  The crazy thing is this, not only do they want to take your kids, they want to take your life, they want you to pay for it, Alex.
[02:24:22.610 --> 02:24:26.592]  So we're going to give them the least amount of money possible and slow the globalists as much as we can.
[02:24:27.032 --> 02:24:28.194]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[02:24:28.194 --> 02:24:38.625]  And again, if people like you that are lawyers and experts know the tax code, and instead of paying huge amounts of money like a lot of the tax companies do, the tax law firms, you guys do it very, very inexpensively.
[02:24:38.625 --> 02:24:43.411]  It is invaluable from small to even large businesses, but also people in trouble.
[02:24:44.289 --> 02:24:50.034]  With the IRS, you guys can negotiate, on average, you said, for 10% of what they're demanding.
[02:24:50.034 --> 02:24:52.537]  That is just amazing results.
[02:24:52.537 --> 02:24:55.820]  What are some of the other services people are going to find at American Tax Relief?
[02:24:55.820 --> 02:25:04.128]  And again, the place to go to get their full services and then support the broadcast when you go there is the site that's on screen, jonestaxrelief.com.
[02:25:04.128 --> 02:25:05.969]  Leads you right to a landing page.
[02:25:05.969 --> 02:25:07.311]  The number's up there, 833-900-8333.
[02:25:10.373 --> 02:25:14.194]  4285 and so much more, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:14.194 --> 02:25:17.495]  Please continue, Tyler, about the services you guys have.
[02:25:17.495 --> 02:25:31.379]  Okay, so let me just mention real quick that the IRS is really, really, really after cryptocurrency because it's not contained by the US Banking Administration, right?
[02:25:31.379 --> 02:25:32.379]  It's DeFi.
[02:25:33.084 --> 02:25:40.129]  And so everybody that has crypto assets is on a list at the IRS and they specifically are going to come after you harder.
[02:25:40.129 --> 02:25:45.673]  And here's the thing is a lot of CPAs and firms that do taxes don't want to touch crypto.
[02:25:45.673 --> 02:25:48.855]  It's a little bit, you know, dicey how the government's going to handle it.
[02:25:49.415 --> 02:25:50.875]  We specialize in that.
[02:25:50.875 --> 02:26:12.121]  If you have crypto assets, if you've made money on coins, NFTs, coin drops, anything like that, we can absolutely help you out so that you're paying the least amount of tax possible because the Biden administration has already labeled you a criminal and hired 500 extra IRS agents to find the alleged crimes that you, just a U.S.
[02:26:12.121 --> 02:26:14.122]  citizen investing, have made.
[02:26:15.763 --> 02:26:18.867]  When we talk about that, there are specialized crypto services.
[02:26:18.867 --> 02:26:21.109]  But let's talk about the business owner, right?
[02:26:21.109 --> 02:26:27.756]  Because this is the person who is getting screwed the most in the middle class by the globalists, okay?
[02:26:27.756 --> 02:26:34.504]  The top corporations in the world use international tax treaties, which we can talk about in a second, to pay almost nothing in taxes.
[02:26:34.924 --> 02:26:41.211]  Whereas me and you in the middle class, we don't have the ability to do that because it's a real pay-to-play globalist game.
[02:26:41.211 --> 02:26:49.240]  And since the IRS was invented in 1913, with the passing of the 16th Amendment, the whole entire thing has been about...
[02:26:49.841 --> 02:26:53.125]  The rich have been able to delete us.
[02:26:53.125 --> 02:26:58.472]  The globalists have been able to put in loopholes that they can only qualify for.
[02:26:58.472 --> 02:26:59.533]  That's the thing.
[02:26:59.533 --> 02:27:05.741]  So where we're starting to see a little bit of change here with advocacy and me and people, what we try to do is we say, hey,
[02:27:06.405 --> 02:27:09.067]  We know that you can do that with 10 million dollars.
[02:27:09.067 --> 02:27:12.810]  How can we replicate that with 10,000 in your bank account?
[02:27:12.810 --> 02:27:20.095]  Well, I want to get you back on very, very soon, Tyler, because the stuff you get into here is just incredible.
[02:27:20.095 --> 02:27:21.916]  A Christian group in Texas called Christians
[02:27:22.296 --> 02:27:23.016]  We're good to go.
[02:27:50.683 --> 02:27:52.083]  Well, I appreciate that, Alex.
[02:27:52.083 --> 02:27:55.664]  And yeah, here's the crazy thing about that story in Texas.
[02:27:55.664 --> 02:28:07.847]  Is that not-for-profit Christian organization was denied not-for-profit status because of their Christian ties, which they said are related to the Republican Party, which is complete BS.
[02:28:07.847 --> 02:28:10.448]  But, beyond that, think about this.
[02:28:10.448 --> 02:28:14.849]  The IRS has given tax-free status to the Church of Scientology.
[02:28:15.686 --> 02:28:20.727]  So, a religion that was invented in the last 50 years that's clearly by anybody's account.
[02:28:20.727 --> 02:28:23.027]  And the Temple of Satan and all those other groups.
[02:28:23.027 --> 02:28:25.508]  Folks, give them a call at 833-900-4285.
[02:28:25.508 --> 02:28:26.128]  833-900-4285.
[02:28:26.128 --> 02:28:36.710]  JonesTaxRelief.com takes you right to the subsection of their site with all their services so that we also get some support with them as sponsors.
[02:28:36.710 --> 02:28:37.930]  A 360 win.
[02:28:37.930 --> 02:28:38.530]  Great job.
[02:28:38.530 --> 02:28:40.851]  I want to invite you back on very, very soon.
[02:28:40.851 --> 02:28:42.291]  Tyler Bennett from American Tax Relief.
[02:28:42.291 --> 02:28:42.931]  Thank you so much.
[02:28:43.954 --> 02:28:45.176]  Absolutely, John.
[02:28:45.176 --> 02:28:46.317]  Alex, it's great to be on here.
[02:28:46.317 --> 02:28:47.099]  You bet.
[02:28:47.099 --> 02:28:49.702]  Yeah, this guy's got as much energy as I do, and then some more.
[02:28:49.702 --> 02:28:50.623]  They're awesome.
[02:28:50.623 --> 02:28:51.645]  Check it out today.
[02:28:51.645 --> 02:28:52.766]  Protect yourself today.

[02:28:58.322 --> 02:29:08.569]  Two of our best-selling products are back in stock in FullWorthStore.com, and they will sell out in the next three, four months before I get more of the product in if I sell it at full price.
[02:29:08.569 --> 02:29:20.978]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting Winter Sun or getting X3 to try the products and see how amazing they are, and I believe you will then get hooked on them like myself and my family.
[02:29:21.318 --> 02:29:21.779]  We're good.
[02:29:36.035 --> 02:29:40.098]  This is your chance to get X3 and experience the good halogens versus the bad halogens.
[02:29:40.098 --> 02:29:44.981]  This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune system as well.
[02:29:44.981 --> 02:29:47.602]  They're amazing and they're at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:29:47.602 --> 02:29:51.605]  And the reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation.
[02:29:51.605 --> 02:29:53.386]  I need funds to run the operation.
[02:29:53.386 --> 02:29:54.266]  You need to be healthy.
[02:29:54.266 --> 02:29:55.487]  We need to stay on air.
[02:29:55.487 --> 02:29:56.428]  It's a match made in heaven.

[02:30:00.270 --> 02:30:14.259]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech, government are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[02:30:14.259 --> 02:30:18.702]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[02:30:18.702 --> 02:30:27.068]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.

[02:30:51.839 --> 02:30:52.399]  It's amazing.
[02:30:58.420 --> 02:30:59.141]  So I did it.
[02:30:59.141 --> 02:31:01.262]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[02:31:01.262 --> 02:31:08.788]  I've been training, probably not as much as I should be, but thank goodness for prayer, and thank goodness for InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:08.788 --> 02:31:14.613]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some TurboForce to give me that energy I need to get going.
[02:31:14.613 --> 02:31:27.803]  You know, besides the energy, TurboForce, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[02:31:28.183 --> 02:31:32.045]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones Soreless.
[02:31:32.045 --> 02:31:33.265]  I have bad joints.
[02:31:33.265 --> 02:31:34.165]  Thanks, Mom.
[02:31:34.165 --> 02:31:41.248]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[02:31:41.248 --> 02:31:45.690]  The quick-release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[02:31:45.690 --> 02:31:56.514]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, TurboForce, that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day, and Soreless can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.

[02:33:11.308 --> 02:33:16.049]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:16.049 --> 02:33:25.332]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.332 --> 02:33:29.393]  January 6th has really come to a head and we now know what it is.
[02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:36.866]  A deep state move to outlaw political opposition to the Democratic Party here in the United States.
[02:33:36.866 --> 02:33:53.621]  But more and more information is coming out in federal documents and in these court cases, and in the 14,000 hours of footage from January 6, the Democrats have been trying to block as pieces of it comes out, showing indeed there were multiple provocateur groups inside the
[02:33:54.804 --> 02:34:08.931]  Oath keepers inside of the Proud Boys, inside of the other groups that were there pushing it, and it's come out in federal court that there were federal informants inside that were helping lead these attacks.
[02:34:10.151 --> 02:34:21.702]  The other people are basically patsies being set up who, yeah, went in the Capitol, stormed the Capitol, you know, what, six weeks in jail, instead held over a year, solitary confinement, many of them.
[02:34:21.702 --> 02:34:30.911]  And we see the move in Canada, peaceful trucker convoy organizers held in shackles, facing 10 years in prison, no bond.
[02:34:30.911 --> 02:34:33.374]  And we know that the White House that came out was advising
[02:34:34.557 --> 02:34:35.918]  We're good to go.
[02:34:59.884 --> 02:35:01.646]  And guess who wrote this?
[02:35:01.646 --> 02:35:08.211]  Matthew Rosenberg, one of the senior Homeland Security writers at the New York Times, got caught trying to pick up a chick.
[02:35:08.211 --> 02:35:09.993]  Didn't know it was a patriot.
[02:35:11.613 --> 02:35:21.536]  said that it's a ton of FBI informants were January 6th basically admits the thing was staged and says it's a drama for political power by the Democrats, which we all know.
[02:35:21.536 --> 02:35:35.900]  But here he is publicly attacking Tucker Carlson, Dr. Beatty, I've been attacked, and then exactly what we say he is now saying in this bombshell article at Infowars.com and ZeroHedge.com as well.
[02:35:35.900 --> 02:35:38.241]  So, Professor, Dr. Darren J.
[02:35:39.201 --> 02:35:49.870]  Beatty, who was also a speechwriter and advisor to President Trump, former professor of political science at Duke University, who is now with us, revolver.news, or at Darren J. Beatty on Twitter.
[02:35:49.870 --> 02:35:55.194]  Completely vindicated, absolute total vindication.
[02:35:55.194 --> 02:36:00.018]  I shot the story over to Tucker this morning and he just responded back, got total vindication.
[02:36:00.018 --> 02:36:01.800]  And that's exactly what this is.
[02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:03.581]  So this is a big deal.
[02:36:03.581 --> 02:36:04.362]  Break it down for us.
[02:36:06.181 --> 02:36:13.831]  Yeah, it's not only vindication for us, it should be humiliation for the New York Times.
[02:36:13.831 --> 02:36:21.240]  I mean, this is not simply a New York Times reporter acknowledging two major things.
[02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:23.784]  One, that yeah, it wasn't really a big deal.
[02:36:24.745 --> 02:36:26.747]  Nothing really to be scared about.
[02:36:26.747 --> 02:36:39.559]  He ridicules and mocks the kind of younger millennial dweebs working for the New York Times who are so like performatively terrified about the event.
[02:36:39.559 --> 02:36:42.362]  But at the same time, he acknowledges that they run the show.
[02:36:43.234 --> 02:36:56.736]  He might mock them in private while trying to pick up a girl, but in public and as part of his job, he's a good little dog and he plays the game that he needs to play to have a byline at the New York Times.
[02:36:56.736 --> 02:37:01.917]  And that's what's so amazing is that this isn't just any New York Times reporter.
[02:37:01.917 --> 02:37:07.418]  This is a New York Times reporter living a double life in at least one sense.
[02:37:07.418 --> 02:37:11.679]  And that is that he's the guy who wrote this extensive piece
[02:37:12.663 --> 02:37:23.368]  Just, you know, ridiculing and criticizing Tucker Carlson for his Patriot Purge documentary, which I played a big role in.
[02:37:23.368 --> 02:37:36.613]  The documentary was really, really influential in terms of mainstreaming the facts and the compelling evidence suggesting a federal involvement role in January 6th.
[02:37:36.613 --> 02:37:40.335]  He goes on to criticize Revolver News' coverage
[02:37:40.855 --> 02:37:44.176]  Of Ray Epps, which, again, is still an open question.
[02:37:44.176 --> 02:37:55.760]  Ray Epps' question hasn't been resolved or answered to any degree, but he mocks anyone who would dare ask questions about Ray Epps.
[02:37:55.760 --> 02:37:57.021]  And then what do you know?
[02:37:58.044 --> 02:38:06.491]  He's on a date or whatever, which is brilliant, by the way, the way that James O'Keefe sets this up, because these people are such pathetic simps.
[02:38:06.491 --> 02:38:09.994]  They'll spill the beans whenever they have a woman in front of them.
[02:38:09.994 --> 02:38:13.857]  And that's a great, you know, kind of business model on Project Veritas' part.
[02:38:13.857 --> 02:38:18.921]  And so he's there, he's bragging, he's frankly being honest.
[02:38:18.921 --> 02:38:27.328]  And in his honest moments, he says, look, the whole January 6th thing, the whole narrative that's been pushed
[02:38:28.041 --> 02:38:33.144]  By the New York Times, very prominently, is a joke.
[02:38:33.144 --> 02:38:34.805]  It's a scam.
[02:38:34.805 --> 02:38:36.065]  It's a lie.
[02:38:36.065 --> 02:38:37.446]  He mocks it.
[02:38:37.446 --> 02:38:39.487]  He mocks his colleagues.
[02:38:39.487 --> 02:38:45.430]  And he says, look, January 6 is not this terror event they're making it out to be.
[02:38:45.430 --> 02:38:49.672]  And oh, by the way, it was swarming with FBI informants.
[02:38:49.672 --> 02:38:54.595]  So I just, it's so rich, you couldn't even make it up and have somebody believe it.
[02:38:55.456 --> 02:39:06.223]  And I'm just reminded, looking at him, that he went on CNN on a bunch of shows, including Anderson Cooper five years ago, or four years ago, and said, Alex Jones and Roger Stone are insane.
[02:39:06.223 --> 02:39:07.744]  No one was spying on the campaign.
[02:39:07.744 --> 02:39:09.124]  No one was wiretapping them.
[02:39:09.124 --> 02:39:12.486]  Of course, we had documents that knew they were, and the same guy sits there and does that.
[02:39:12.486 --> 02:39:16.429]  So we now know whatever he's saying, he knows it's the opposite.
[02:39:16.429 --> 02:39:18.510]  This is just devastating.
[02:39:18.510 --> 02:39:23.193]  But I guess with the corporate media, they've been caught lying so much, they're just going to move on like nothing's happened.
[02:39:24.204 --> 02:39:37.357]  No, frankly, I mean, we can point this out and mock them and expose them, but in a way, ultimately, the joke's on us because the mainstream outlets have such a stranglehold on sort of
[02:39:38.334 --> 02:39:43.996]  Legitimate public opinion that they're just going to move on and they're going to move on to the next lie.
[02:39:43.996 --> 02:39:46.858]  And there's really no accountability to this system.
[02:39:46.858 --> 02:40:04.905]  And really, I think the sort of double life of this of this reporter, the enormous discrepancy between the public reporting, official reporting and the private understanding, it underscores something more generally about our society and our system, which is that
[02:40:05.899 --> 02:40:16.083]  In order to work for an organization like the New York Times right now, you really either have to be a slavish coward or an idiot.
[02:40:17.048 --> 02:40:20.290]  That's the only way you can get by in an institution like that.
[02:40:20.290 --> 02:40:36.882]  You're either dumb enough to believe the mainstream narrative, or you're a good enough obedient dog that you know the truth and you'll say it in private when you don't know you're being recorded, but publicly you'll do what you're told like a good obedient dog, which seems to be what this guy is in.
[02:40:37.062 --> 02:40:40.385]  Well, that's right, Dr. Beatty, and let me just throw this out here.
[02:40:40.385 --> 02:40:44.929]  Elizabeth Williamson basically stalks me, writes articles full of lies at the New York Times.
[02:40:44.929 --> 02:40:49.614]  But then I've met with her colleagues over the years, and I go, you know, she's a joke at the New York Times.
[02:40:49.614 --> 02:40:51.695]  She actually believes her lies.
[02:40:51.695 --> 02:40:56.120]  With the other ones, they know, oh, we listen, we all know it's a fraud, uh-huh, this is off record.
[02:40:56.120 --> 02:40:59.623]  I mean, I've met with New York Times reporters that literally admit it's all a big fraud.
[02:41:00.303 --> 02:41:01.784]  I mean, I've had drinks with them.
[02:41:01.784 --> 02:41:05.767]  But then they make fun of her because at least they're mercenaries.
[02:41:05.767 --> 02:41:08.149]  I mean, I've gone out with ABC News anchors, you name it.
[02:41:08.149 --> 02:41:09.250]  Steaks, wine.
[02:41:09.250 --> 02:41:11.251]  They're like, hey, at least, yeah, we're mercenaries.
[02:41:11.251 --> 02:41:12.232]  Alex would really like you.
[02:41:12.232 --> 02:41:14.834]  But at least they'll admit behind the scenes they're mercenaries.
[02:41:14.834 --> 02:41:18.476]  This Elizabeth Williams woman is a joke of the New York Times because she believes it.
[02:41:18.476 --> 02:41:27.923]  And then people like this guy, he laughs at her, Matthew Rosenberg, because he can't believe that because he talks about the other reporters, the ones that actually believe the bull.
[02:41:27.923 --> 02:41:28.864]  They're the biggest idiots.
[02:41:30.967 --> 02:41:42.331]  No, it's so true, and the reporter you just showed, she does have that sort of deranged Elizabeth Warren slash Jeb Bush look about her.
[02:41:42.331 --> 02:41:51.193]  There's a certain sort of physiognomy that never portends good things, and she seems to have it.
[02:41:51.193 --> 02:41:54.254]  Kind of idiotic sociopathy that you see.
[02:41:54.254 --> 02:41:58.155]  Yeah, it's like an idiotic witch that stuck its penis in an electrical socket.
[02:41:59.662 --> 02:42:00.983]  Sorry, I'm sorry.
[02:42:00.983 --> 02:42:01.823]  I'm being obnoxious.
[02:42:01.823 --> 02:42:04.224]  Please continue.
[02:42:04.224 --> 02:42:05.965]  No, it's it's it's true.
[02:42:05.965 --> 02:42:23.192]  And it really like the larger question here is what kind of moron or scoundrel do you have to be these days in order to actually work at a mainstream American institution and live with yourself?
[02:42:23.192 --> 02:42:24.053]  And you really do.
[02:42:24.053 --> 02:42:25.053]  You either have to be
[02:42:27.870 --> 02:42:33.254]  A slavish dog or an idiot.
[02:42:33.254 --> 02:42:43.921]  And if you've ever asked yourself, why are institutions getting so and so, so much more mediocre, so low in quality, it's because a precondition for working there.
[02:42:43.921 --> 02:42:54.308]  Yeah, they want high quality, but high quality subject to the primary criteria of one, either being a slavish, obedient dog and having no dignity or two, being an idiot.
[02:42:54.308 --> 02:42:54.768]  That's right.
[02:42:54.768 --> 02:42:55.009]  Stay there.
[02:42:55.009 --> 02:42:55.469]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:58.843 --> 02:43:04.987]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great InfoWars listeners and viewers.
[02:43:04.987 --> 02:43:13.772]  If you will simply get X3 with all three types of good iodine that boost your immune system and help everything that goes on in your body at the cellular level,
[02:43:14.512 --> 02:43:15.633]  It will change your life.
[02:43:15.633 --> 02:43:16.794]  It will invigorate you.
[02:43:16.794 --> 02:43:17.974]  It will empower you.
[02:43:17.974 --> 02:43:21.076]  Almost everyone has iodine deficiency.
[02:43:21.076 --> 02:43:22.617]  Look into it for yourself.
[02:43:22.617 --> 02:43:24.118]  It's the opposite of fluoride.
[02:43:24.118 --> 02:43:26.339]  It's the good halogen.
[02:43:26.339 --> 02:43:29.741]  And then your purchase of X3 funds our operation.
[02:43:29.741 --> 02:43:35.485]  Now, a lot of our products have been sold out and never came back in because of the lockdowns and supply chain breakdowns.
[02:43:35.485 --> 02:43:37.886]  We were sold out of X3 for a long time.
[02:43:37.886 --> 02:43:38.867]  And I had it on sale.
[02:43:38.867 --> 02:43:39.467]  We're 50% off.
[02:43:39.467 --> 02:43:40.608]  A lot of folks have been getting it.
[02:43:40.888 --> 02:43:41.989]  And I was thinking, you know what?
[02:43:41.989 --> 02:43:45.674]  I'm going to bring it back on sale again, just until it sells out.
[02:43:45.674 --> 02:43:53.082]  Because even though we won't make as much money in the long run, a lot of folks need this product, and we need to get the money from the sales in now to stay on air.
[02:43:53.082 --> 02:43:56.666]  So get your X3 right now at 50% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:43:57.950 --> 02:44:03.337]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[02:44:03.337 --> 02:44:12.750]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[02:44:13.371 --> 02:44:23.342]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[02:44:23.342 --> 02:44:30.110]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[02:44:30.110 --> 02:44:31.531]  But there is only two things to do.
[02:44:32.652 --> 02:44:35.796]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[02:44:35.796 --> 02:44:39.100]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[02:44:39.100 --> 02:44:44.506]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[02:44:44.506 --> 02:44:46.328]  And so, we must prepare.
[02:44:46.328 --> 02:44:48.170]  Get up to a year's worth of storable foods.
[02:44:48.770 --> 02:44:49.571]  We're good to go.
[02:45:04.531 --> 02:45:14.194]  Now it is easier than ever to take in the new liquid form with eight beneficial super ingredients, Brain Force Ultra is the result of years of enhanced formulation.
[02:45:14.194 --> 02:45:19.896]  Free of toxic additives, each ingredient is specifically selected for its many key properties.
[02:45:19.896 --> 02:45:23.938]  Some of the proprietary super ingredients behind Brain Force Ultra include
[02:45:24.438 --> 02:45:31.983]  Gorana seed, which is loaded with energy compounds and antioxidants that have been used by Amazonian tribes for centuries.
[02:45:31.983 --> 02:45:37.807]  Alpha-GPC, a natural compound found in the brain that delivers an essential nutrient, choline.
[02:45:37.807 --> 02:45:41.910]  And Ginkgo leaf, which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant content.
[02:45:42.170 --> 02:45:48.293]  This product is more than twice the servings of our Brain Force Plus as well, so you know it's packed full of the good stuff.
[02:45:48.293 --> 02:45:57.398]  Destroy that brain fog today and secure your bottle of Brain Force Ultra before it is completely sold out at m4store.com.
[02:45:57.398 --> 02:46:08.203]  It has been noted by many a historian, the first casualty of war is the truth.
[02:46:08.203 --> 02:46:09.344]  The next big casualty
[02:46:11.638 --> 02:46:14.359]  Is it even the people that die?
[02:46:14.359 --> 02:46:16.460]  No, that invariably follows.
[02:46:16.460 --> 02:46:24.765]  But first, there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty, and speech, and massive censorship.
[02:46:24.765 --> 02:46:39.774]  And now, across the world, from the United States to Europe, legislation's being introduced that if you amplify any, quote, pro-Russian information, you can be censored, you can be arrested,
[02:46:40.354 --> 02:46:41.735]  You can be in prison.
[02:46:41.735 --> 02:46:54.487]  And of course now, Canada's introduced legislation that if you have a fraud crime, and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online, that you will be censored and arrested.
[02:46:54.487 --> 02:46:59.992]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the world.
[02:46:59.992 --> 02:47:05.877]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:17.097 --> 02:47:29.530]  My eyes are blind, but I can see snowflakes glistening on the trees.
[02:47:29.530 --> 02:47:30.832]  Dr. Darren J. Beatty is our guest.
[02:47:30.832 --> 02:47:32.233]  Revolver.News.
[02:47:32.233 --> 02:47:34.115]  At Darren J. Beatty on Twitter.
[02:47:34.115 --> 02:47:37.419]  You should really follow his instrumental, critical work.
[02:47:38.800 --> 02:47:45.684]  We'll have him back up for a full hour as soon as he can do it to get into the larger Ukraine situation, Russia, China, how he sees all that working together.
[02:47:45.684 --> 02:47:48.226]  But I want to clarify, too, what I was saying earlier.
[02:47:48.226 --> 02:47:55.510]  I feel like I traffic around the New York Times or with ABC people a lot, but I do know how to meet with people off record.
[02:47:55.510 --> 02:47:59.393]  And, you know, I've been interviewed by one time, the anchor of ABC came down here like 10 years ago now.
[02:47:59.393 --> 02:48:00.814]  And I said, you're just a mercenary.
[02:48:00.814 --> 02:48:01.394]  I said, that's OK.
[02:48:01.394 --> 02:48:02.495]  And he goes, hey, let's go get dinner.
[02:48:03.305 --> 02:48:10.852]  And he'd been the host of 700 Club and all that before that, and he wasn't really an evil guy, but he said, yeah, I know a lot of what you say is true, but this is where I work.
[02:48:10.852 --> 02:48:18.698]  And with the New York Times people, I met some at the RNC in 2016, got to know them, and then got to know them over the years, and they would come to town.
[02:48:18.698 --> 02:48:23.162]  I met with some of them, and I know a lot of other ones, obviously, and they just make fun.
[02:48:23.162 --> 02:48:30.909]  I guess that's a thing of the libtards that actually believe the Kool-Aid, and that's what this guy is doing, Matthew Rosenberg, in the video.
[02:48:32.352 --> 02:48:36.234]  And it's just crazy to watch this, but yes, this is good.
[02:48:36.234 --> 02:48:38.356]  This has come out, and great job to Veritas.
[02:48:38.356 --> 02:48:42.878]  They are just unreal how amazing they are, and what James O'Keefe and his team do.
[02:48:42.878 --> 02:48:46.740]  But here's the bad news.
[02:48:46.740 --> 02:48:50.362]  Sloppy criminal action by Chris Wray's FBI.
[02:48:50.362 --> 02:48:52.443]  Fed secretly spied on Steve Bannon's lawyer.
[02:48:52.443 --> 02:48:54.404]  It's totally illegal.
[02:48:54.404 --> 02:48:59.127]  We've got longtime Proud Boy leader Enrique Tarrio charged with conspiracy, January 6th.
[02:49:00.458 --> 02:49:08.164]  Now we've got inside January 6th committee's effort to trace every dollar raised and spent by Trump's false election claims.
[02:49:08.164 --> 02:49:16.652]  This article goes on to say it's illegal to challenge elections and the FBI is being told by the Justice Department it's criminal to raise money to challenge elections.
[02:49:16.652 --> 02:49:17.552]  That's just not true.
[02:49:17.552 --> 02:49:22.196]  It's like saying it's illegal to raise money to, you know, for charities or whatever.
[02:49:22.196 --> 02:49:22.476]  It's just...
[02:49:23.410 --> 02:49:25.351]  They're clearly trying to outlaw their opposition.
[02:49:25.351 --> 02:49:28.112]  They're building everything on this sand.
[02:49:28.112 --> 02:49:30.393]  We're 244 days out from the election.
[02:49:30.393 --> 02:49:32.834]  They're trying to outlaw their political opposition.
[02:49:32.834 --> 02:49:33.915]  I know you've agreed with that.
[02:49:33.915 --> 02:49:35.015]  You've talked about it.
[02:49:35.015 --> 02:49:36.716]  But how serious is this?
[02:49:36.716 --> 02:49:41.078]  Because I know the globalists and the Democrats are buffoons at a certain level.
[02:49:41.078 --> 02:49:41.878]  My God, look at them.
[02:49:41.878 --> 02:49:42.959]  But they still have the power.
[02:49:43.519 --> 02:50:00.860]  And I don't see them doing all this and branding their opposition as terrorists and announcing if you question elections you're a terrorist or if you question lockdowns you're a terrorist and put that officially into the doctrine of the FBI and the military in America without them planning some big preparatory event or false flag
[02:50:01.320 --> 02:50:06.583]  to help them sell this invasion of America by the captured federal state.
[02:50:06.583 --> 02:50:12.806]  So just as the Russians, they figure, would stage some false flags to come into Ukraine, it looks like they did do some car bombs and things.
[02:50:12.806 --> 02:50:16.928]  That was actually State Department being true in my view once in a while.
[02:50:16.928 --> 02:50:25.773]  Clearly, they're going to need some preparatory event to fully outlaw their opposition, which is populist, which is up and coming, which is winning.
[02:50:25.773 --> 02:50:27.334]  And so they're desperate to do that.
[02:50:27.334 --> 02:50:28.735]  They're branding it all for that.
[02:50:28.735 --> 02:50:29.855]  I see them doing that.
[02:50:29.855 --> 02:50:30.716]  What is your view on that?
[02:50:33.061 --> 02:50:41.669]  Well, they've certainly been planting this narrative that their political opposition constitutes a national security threat.
[02:50:41.669 --> 02:50:52.079]  That's been a dominant theme, really, since the Trump phenomenon began, but it's really accelerated in terms of its intensity over the past
[02:50:53.951 --> 02:50:56.193]  Over the past couple of years.
[02:50:56.193 --> 02:50:58.595]  And you see that in every dimension.
[02:50:58.595 --> 02:51:02.318]  You already see transformations on this basis.
[02:51:02.318 --> 02:51:08.202]  You see the weaponization of the national security apparatus against the American people.
[02:51:08.202 --> 02:51:19.351]  You see in particular, we've written about this at revolver.news quite a bit, that the Department of Homeland Security has irrigated to itself a special role in this transformation.
[02:51:19.887 --> 02:51:32.914]  As early as the Trump years, under the Trump presidency, the DHS released a report suggesting that white supremacy was the new number one terror threat.
[02:51:32.914 --> 02:51:36.216]  So this transformation is really in the works.
[02:51:36.216 --> 02:51:46.722]  And of course, January 6th, the lies told about January 6th have been tremendously useful to the regime in terms of advancing the implementation
[02:51:47.418 --> 02:51:53.544]  Of this agenda as for whether there's going to be another event or another false flag event.
[02:51:53.544 --> 02:51:56.647]  That's certainly that's certainly possible.
[02:51:56.647 --> 02:52:04.494]  I think they've already gotten a tremendous amount of mileage out of the nothing burger of January 6 and other things.
[02:52:04.494 --> 02:52:06.316]  So the question is, are things so?
[02:52:07.958 --> 02:52:11.981]  So bleak at this point that they even need another false flag.
[02:52:11.981 --> 02:52:25.048]  But we have seen some indications that, you know, there have been reports from ex-generals and so forth saying they anticipate another kind of domestic insurrection.
[02:52:25.048 --> 02:52:28.470]  Well, yeah, I mean, they've got the CIA saying civil war is already begun.
[02:52:28.470 --> 02:52:30.331]  I mean, here's what I'm saying, Doc.
[02:52:32.003 --> 02:52:35.345]  Biden doesn't care if the gas prices are $6 a gallon.
[02:52:35.345 --> 02:52:38.046]  They don't care if their poll numbers are below 30.
[02:52:38.046 --> 02:52:41.868]  No one ever acts like this politically unless they're planning to just set up a dictatorship.
[02:52:41.868 --> 02:52:43.809]  They're acting like they don't have a care in their world.
[02:52:43.809 --> 02:52:49.571]  They're just totally arrogant, and they've got all their generals and CIA saying, we're preparing for war with the American people.
[02:52:49.571 --> 02:52:53.853]  I mean, it's just, is this the madness of King George, or what the hell's going on here?
[02:52:55.020 --> 02:52:57.964]  Well, I mean, it's it's a very interesting point.
[02:52:57.964 --> 02:53:09.519]  And as for whether they're preparing for any kind of decisive coup type event after which you say, wow, we're radically something different from what we were yesterday.
[02:53:10.640 --> 02:53:29.973]  That I don't know, but I think it's almost a more useful exercise to reflect instead of, oh, are they going to do some kind of dramatic coup to become a dictatorship, is to look at the situation on the ground, see how much things have changed over the past year, two years, five years, ten years, and recognize that we're all ready.
[02:53:30.553 --> 02:53:32.974]  We're in a dystopian situation.
[02:53:32.974 --> 02:53:34.735]  We're already in a tyranny.
[02:53:34.735 --> 02:53:49.742]  If you had told, you know, the version of yourself, you know, years ago, it's like, okay, people, there's going to be the lockdowns, there's going to be all the COVID nonsense, there's going to be this level of lies, the national security apparatus is going to come against the American people.
[02:53:49.742 --> 02:53:55.705]  But ironically, you, Alex, is probably, you know, one of the few people who actually knew all of this stuff back years ago.
[02:53:55.705 --> 02:53:57.306]  But most people, if they would have
[02:53:57.586 --> 02:54:06.011]  You know, talk to the earlier version of themselves, they would be astonished and they say, if all of those things were to happen, we would already be in tyranny.
[02:54:06.011 --> 02:54:09.232]  So I think if you look at the actual... No, you're right.
[02:54:09.232 --> 02:54:19.098]  They're already winning with the iceberg effect, already winning with the glacial slow-moving effect, but over time, completely devastating and pretty soon you're already cooked like the frog in the pot.
[02:54:19.438 --> 02:54:19.838]  Yes.
[02:54:19.838 --> 02:54:32.646]  So I think we're all kind of looking for, is there going to be some grand coup event where Biden declares himself emperor or whoever's behind him declares himself emperor and suspends the Constitution?
[02:54:32.646 --> 02:54:41.672]  But I think it might be the darker truth about the dystopia that we're in is that they've already effectively done that in all but formality.
[02:54:42.435 --> 02:54:54.485]  And it's preserving that formality that allows them to hang on to this thread, this pretense of legitimacy that is eroding before our eyes.
[02:54:54.485 --> 02:54:56.427]  That is the smartest thing I've heard in years.
[02:54:56.427 --> 02:54:58.209]  That is exactly where we are.
[02:54:58.209 --> 02:54:59.590]  I just see the buildup.
[02:54:59.590 --> 02:55:00.351]  We're in a civil war.
[02:55:00.351 --> 02:55:01.351]  They're going to be terrorists.
[02:55:01.351 --> 02:55:05.935]  I see them staging some things, provocateuring things to further cement what they've done.
[02:55:05.935 --> 02:55:07.817]  And then they're like, we're the democracy.
[02:55:07.817 --> 02:55:09.679]  We're not the ones that blew up another federal building.
[02:55:10.439 --> 02:55:10.900]  But I agree.
[02:55:10.900 --> 02:55:15.244]  We don't see a big emperor announcement or we are a dictatorship officially.
[02:55:15.244 --> 02:55:18.448]  I'm seeing more events to further outlaw political opposition.
[02:55:18.448 --> 02:55:29.840]  I see them needing something more to really then say, oh, don't question the election when they steal the midterms in 244 days, which if they already did it before, they're trying to outlaw questioning it.
[02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:30.781]  We know their next move.
[02:55:32.003 --> 02:55:32.383]  Right.
[02:55:32.383 --> 02:55:53.176]  No, I think it's very possible, and they're certainly sort of wargaming these kinds of scenarios to say, if there's anything off with the election, we are going to preemptively frame any opposition to it as some kind of, you know, proto-insurrection or some kind of dangerous national security threat.
[02:55:53.796 --> 02:56:11.439]  And this is part of the reason why the regime pushed back so hard and freaked out so much about Revolver News' coverage on January 6th, because the more that type of coverage comes out, the more skeptical people will be when this new thing rolls out.
[02:56:11.439 --> 02:56:20.881]  People are already at peak levels of skepticism, and unlike decades before, where the government was more easily able to pull off these things,
[02:56:21.241 --> 02:56:26.387]  We're still in an age of kind of mass-distributed surveillance.
[02:56:26.387 --> 02:56:34.377]  People have cell phones, people have the internet, so it actually makes it more difficult for the regime to pull off... Well that's right, we're surveilling them.
[02:56:34.377 --> 02:56:37.261]  We think of them as surveilling us, but we're actually decentralized.
[02:56:37.701 --> 02:56:45.263]  Humet decentralization, and that's why everybody being a reporter, everybody calling in to talk radio, everybody putting videos out is so powerful.
[02:56:45.263 --> 02:56:50.925]  You may just put out two videos a year, folks, but your Humet is much more credible to the public than the enemy's.
[02:56:50.925 --> 02:56:54.886]  That's why the only way the enemy wins is the common person not being active and engaged.
[02:56:54.886 --> 02:57:06.589]  We're going to come back and do five more minutes with Dr. Beatty, and then Mike Adams has just got everything's bombshell here, but this is just bombshell, bombshell, bombshell, tying the Russia situation with Ukraine.
[02:57:07.009 --> 02:57:12.037]  And the COVID tyranny and all of it next hour with the great Mike Adams of Natural News.
[02:57:12.037 --> 02:57:18.567]  Be sure to check out revolver.news for all of the verboten information on January 6th, the China and so much more.
[02:57:18.567 --> 02:57:19.709]  And whatever you do.
[02:57:20.552 --> 02:57:32.021]  Realize that the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless, and the number one thing you can do is share this live interview, share the archive of it later, and get it out to folks, because people are ready for the truth now.
[02:57:32.021 --> 02:57:34.904]  So keep sharing the articles and links from Bandod Video.
[02:57:34.904 --> 02:57:38.406]  You are the resistance, and this is a war we're in.
[02:57:38.406 --> 02:57:42.410]  All right, hour number four is only two minutes away.
[02:57:48.226 --> 02:57:53.450]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022.
[02:57:53.450 --> 02:58:12.302]  And in the month of February, we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, X3, that has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much.
[02:58:12.302 --> 02:58:16.185]  And the majority of the population of the world is iodine deficient.
[02:58:16.185 --> 02:58:17.686]  This is the very best iodine out there.
[02:58:18.506 --> 02:58:22.329]  We had it on sale at 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have.
[02:58:22.329 --> 02:58:24.230]  More isn't going to come in for a long time.
[02:58:24.230 --> 02:58:26.231]  So I took it back to full price.
[02:58:26.231 --> 02:58:27.852]  And I was just thinking, you know what?
[02:58:27.852 --> 02:58:30.194]  We need the funds in now to stay on air.
[02:58:30.194 --> 02:58:32.555]  Plus, this is a great product everybody needs.
[02:58:32.555 --> 02:58:42.101]  So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience it for yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out.
[02:58:42.101 --> 02:58:45.463]  Get X3 right now exclusively at InfowarsStore.com for 50% off.
[02:58:48.678 --> 02:58:55.203]  I stay on air selling high quality products that you need, that you want, and that you're going to be happy with.
[02:58:55.203 --> 02:58:58.245]  That's why you come back and buy products from me again.
[02:58:58.245 --> 02:59:00.046]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[02:59:00.046 --> 02:59:06.931]  I promote liberty, I promote freedom, I fight the globalists, and I'm able to do that because you buy products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[02:59:06.931 --> 02:59:08.432]  And listen, all the products are great.
[02:59:08.832 --> 02:59:19.320]  But when it comes to high-quality, storable food in an inflationary system with major supply chain breakdowns, this is an absolute 360 win, a no-brainer.
[02:59:19.320 --> 02:59:22.683]  And they've got high-quality, storable food ready to ship to you right now.
[02:59:22.683 --> 02:59:27.587]  The great folks at My Patriot Supply exclusively at PrepareWithAlex.com discounted.
[02:59:27.587 --> 02:59:31.350]  So again, beat inflation, be prepared, fund the InfoWar.
[02:59:31.350 --> 02:59:37.575]  The only way you lose is not taking action at InfoWarStore.com or PrepareWithAlex.com right now.
[02:59:37.875 --> 02:59:39.256]  This is high quality, storable food.
[02:59:39.256 --> 02:59:41.279]  This is how you beat inflation.
[02:59:41.279 --> 02:59:42.039]  Get yours today.
[02:59:42.039 --> 02:59:43.000]  It's ready to ship.
[02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:50.809]  But I wouldn't wait because prices are about to go up because inflation is exploding.
[02:59:50.809 --> 02:59:54.733]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:01.699 --> 03:00:07.283]  All right, final segment with Revolver News Head, Dr. Darren J. Beatty, Revolver.News on Alex Jones.
[03:00:07.283 --> 03:00:09.104]  Your host, Mike Adams, is coming up.
[03:00:09.104 --> 03:00:11.226]  Got a lot to cover here in the next hour.
[03:00:11.226 --> 03:00:16.930]  Other in the five minutes we have left, Doc, what are other key areas you want to cover?
[03:00:16.930 --> 03:00:26.656]  Other things you think people should know about Jan 6 and why it's so important and what you think is coming next and how we as a people, I think, can come together and call for peace and not call for violent revolution.
[03:00:26.656 --> 03:00:28.037]  I think that's very important.
[03:00:28.037 --> 03:00:28.958]  What else is on your radar?
[03:00:30.182 --> 03:00:44.165]  Well, the biggest thing we'll take home is that our politics in this country will be largely fake and performative until the national security state is brought to heel, until it's brought into the proper fold.
[03:00:44.165 --> 03:00:55.107]  And January 6th, the lies told about January 6th are meant to advance this larger narrative that the role of the national security state is effectively to crush
[03:00:55.587 --> 03:00:56.968]  And to fight and to overcome.
[03:01:10.629 --> 03:01:11.649]  Perfectly said.
[03:01:11.649 --> 03:01:14.331]  I mean, I lose sleep at night over this.
[03:01:14.331 --> 03:01:18.692]  The fall of our republic, and then there's no more example of liberty worldwide.
[03:01:18.692 --> 03:01:21.673]  I mean, I wish there was a bunch of other countries that were freer than us.
[03:01:21.673 --> 03:01:23.754]  We're the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[03:01:23.754 --> 03:01:24.655]  Look at Australia.
[03:01:24.655 --> 03:01:25.275]  Look at Europe.
[03:01:26.610 --> 03:01:27.491]  Look at the UK.
[03:01:27.491 --> 03:01:29.993]  I mean, it all runs from bad to worse.
[03:01:29.993 --> 03:01:32.376]  And we're the bad and they're the worse.
[03:01:32.376 --> 03:01:39.443]  And China and North Korea, you know, it's just, my God, why has the elite of the world given up on freedom in the Renaissance?
[03:01:39.443 --> 03:01:42.166]  That's what's protected them and the general public.
[03:01:42.166 --> 03:01:49.453]  What aristocrat, what system gets rid of a free society when that's the safest, best system for everybody?
[03:01:51.152 --> 03:01:53.594]  No, it's outrageous, and you're absolutely right.
[03:01:53.594 --> 03:02:00.979]  We've given up, when we give up all of our freedoms, which we're very close to having done, we will be nothing better, nothing different from China.
[03:02:00.979 --> 03:02:08.065]  In fact, the only difference would be sometimes I say that we're going to be exactly like China, plus drag queens.
[03:02:08.065 --> 03:02:09.185]  That's the only difference.
[03:02:09.185 --> 03:02:11.527]  China doesn't have the drag queens, and we do.
[03:02:11.527 --> 03:02:18.132]  Other than that... You're a sicky sweet leftist, anti-male, anti-family patina.
[03:02:18.132 --> 03:02:19.393]  That's the only difference.
[03:02:19.393 --> 03:02:20.174]  Right.
[03:02:20.174 --> 03:02:20.334]  Right.
[03:02:20.994 --> 03:02:40.900]  No, and that's the direction we're heading and it's where we'll be if people like you, people like me, people like the whole group of patriots listening to this don't continue to expose and act against these really dangerous transformations that are taking place at this pivotal moment.
[03:02:41.440 --> 03:02:42.801]  In our nation's history.
[03:02:42.801 --> 03:02:44.063]  What do you think they do about Biden?
[03:02:44.063 --> 03:02:48.166]  I mean, they knew he was controllable and an idiot, but he's really deteriorating fast.
[03:02:48.166 --> 03:02:49.888]  World leaders won't talk to him.
[03:02:49.888 --> 03:02:51.029]  He's super arrogant.
[03:02:51.029 --> 03:02:51.970]  What's going to happen with that guy?
[03:02:53.982 --> 03:03:00.026]  I think that's probably a big problem for them internally, and they're probably still figuring out what to do.
[03:03:00.026 --> 03:03:19.979]  And if you look at their moments of really impressive hyper coordination that they exposed throughout the Democratic primary, there's moments of like totally unexpected, but really powerful consolidation in order to push Biden into the presidency.
[03:03:19.979 --> 03:03:23.642]  And whatever kind of mechanisms were behind that, I'm not sure if they've
[03:03:24.142 --> 03:03:34.230]  Fully reached a consensus on how to delicately get over the Biden situation and save face while doing so.
[03:03:34.230 --> 03:03:34.670]  Well, that's right.
[03:03:34.670 --> 03:03:39.954]  They showed incredible coordination, like a cartoon where the cat's got a hundred plates and saucers trying to balance them.
[03:03:39.954 --> 03:03:45.779]  I wish they'd put that into space bases and moon bases and life extension and being a good society.
[03:03:45.779 --> 03:03:48.341]  If they put that type of work into that, we would be at the next level.
[03:03:50.583 --> 03:03:51.043]  Right.
[03:03:51.043 --> 03:03:57.067]  No, I mean, I wish we would orient ourselves toward, you know, great, great achievements.
[03:03:57.067 --> 03:03:59.569]  And again, it's like China for all its faults.
[03:03:59.569 --> 03:04:06.514]  It does seem to be oriented toward actually making things and developing their country to a certain degree, whereas
[03:04:07.234 --> 03:04:25.863]  In the United States, or what I call the globalist American empire, it really seems to be simply an exercise of continuous resource extraction and exploitation on the part of a corrupt, decrepit, illegitimate ruling class against its increasingly indignant citizens.
[03:04:25.863 --> 03:04:28.945]  That's right, we have a spoiled, rotten, America-hating group of trash
[03:04:29.825 --> 03:04:34.049]  That are fifth-generational trust fund kids, and they're the worst on earth.
[03:04:34.049 --> 03:04:35.431]  Dr. Beattie, always amazing.
[03:04:35.431 --> 03:04:36.331]  Congratulations.
[03:04:36.331 --> 03:04:37.272]  I know Tucker tonight.
[03:04:37.272 --> 03:04:38.553]  I don't even need to talk to him.
[03:04:38.553 --> 03:04:41.536]  I know he's going to be doing a victory lap with this information.
[03:04:41.536 --> 03:04:42.777]  So, thank you so much, Doc.
[03:04:42.777 --> 03:04:45.059]  It's a victory lap for you as well.
[03:04:45.059 --> 03:04:46.521]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:46.521 --> 03:04:48.983]  Great job, Project Veritas!
[03:04:48.983 --> 03:04:49.724]  Whoo!
[03:04:49.724 --> 03:04:50.845]  Man!
[03:04:50.845 --> 03:04:52.386]  Man, that guy's a superhero.
[03:04:52.386 --> 03:04:52.927]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:57.779 --> 03:05:01.842]  The first ten amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791.
[03:05:01.842 --> 03:05:07.946]  The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press.
[03:05:07.946 --> 03:05:16.192]  Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference, and restraint by the government.
[03:05:17.833 --> 03:05:23.518]  231 years later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious attack.
[03:05:23.518 --> 03:05:25.900]  GCN is under attack.
[03:05:25.900 --> 03:05:30.704]  Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not want you to know the truth.
[03:05:30.704 --> 03:05:38.331]  I'm asking our fellow broadcasters, and you, to rise up and help us defend our right to continue telling you the truth.
[03:05:38.911 --> 03:05:40.412]  Would you like to join us?
[03:05:40.412 --> 03:05:45.594]  If so, please consider visiting SaveGCN.com.

[03:05:55.297 --> 03:06:00.579]  I'm Vincent Fennelli.
[03:06:00.579 --> 03:06:08.142]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:10.868 --> 03:06:18.952]  Well, Maria Zakharova is the head spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Information, and she just came out in a big press conference.
[03:06:18.952 --> 03:06:21.694]  The video is on Infowars.com as we speak.
[03:06:21.694 --> 03:06:23.815]  We're going to post it on the live show feed as well.
[03:06:23.815 --> 03:06:24.635]  Breaking video.
[03:06:24.635 --> 03:06:28.918]  Russia tells the US, we have found your biological weapons, which they're now
[03:06:29.716 --> 03:06:38.724]  Victoria Nuland is confirming their bioweapon labs, but saying it's Ukraine's, but I have the Washington Post from 2005 saying Obama paid for it and did it.
[03:06:38.724 --> 03:06:43.608]  So this is all exploding in their face, literally and figuratively.
[03:06:43.608 --> 03:06:44.409]  Here she is talking.
[03:06:45.333 --> 03:07:02.423]  Suggesting, Miss Sakharova, that the Russians have now discovered, just discovered, the remnant vestiges of chemical and biological weapons factories, and also adding that the United States is in control of all these sites.
[03:07:02.423 --> 03:07:04.404]  Now, just in April 2020, the U.S.
[03:07:04.404 --> 03:07:08.787]  Embassy in Ukraine issued a stark statement completely categorically denying
[03:07:09.267 --> 03:07:17.971]  That the US are running any biological weapons sites in Ukraine as have the security services of Ukraine.
[03:07:18.408 --> 03:07:21.290]  All right, so Mike Adams is here to cover the waterfront.
[03:07:21.290 --> 03:07:27.213]  Over a year and a half ago, he was just hammering that they're going to cut the fertilizer off next, and they'd start a big war.
[03:07:27.213 --> 03:07:28.414]  He's been dead on.
[03:07:28.414 --> 03:07:34.858]  Tomorrow's News Today, NaturalNews.com, and he's got a bunch of articles out on this.
[03:07:34.858 --> 03:07:42.242]  The starvation matrix decoded, Russian fertilizer, hydrocarbon CO2, the Haber equation, and crop yields explained.
[03:07:42.242 --> 03:07:43.763]  This is so important.
[03:07:43.763 --> 03:07:44.644]  This just came out.
[03:07:45.137 --> 03:07:46.718]  We're going to be getting to corn and soybean.
[03:07:46.718 --> 03:07:50.660]  Farmer warns Americans that average grocery bill will increase by $1,000 a month.
[03:07:50.660 --> 03:07:52.641]  That'll starve the third world to death.
[03:07:52.641 --> 03:07:59.045]  When the metric goes above the level it's already gone above, it will cause mass rebellions in the third world.
[03:07:59.045 --> 03:08:02.807]  When you spend more than half your paycheck on food, it's a well-known equation.
[03:08:02.807 --> 03:08:04.948]  Last time it happened, we had the Arab Spring.
[03:08:04.948 --> 03:08:08.270]  The binary weapon extermination plot becomes clear.
[03:08:08.270 --> 03:08:14.453]  mRNA spike protein injections suppress DNA repair, followed by global nuclear events that unleash DNA-damaging radiation.
[03:08:15.293 --> 03:08:16.854]  So much more.
[03:08:16.854 --> 03:08:19.555]  And Mike's going to take over because I want to actually hear him talk.
[03:08:19.555 --> 03:08:23.397]  He's going to host the rest of the show coming up here in about 20 minutes.
[03:08:23.397 --> 03:08:24.798]  And then Owen Schroer is coming up.
[03:08:24.798 --> 03:08:26.278]  But Mike, you're always on fire.
[03:08:26.278 --> 03:08:29.320]  You've really been on fire lately.
[03:08:29.320 --> 03:08:32.801]  Obviously, I just want your take on Russia and Ukraine and just big picture.
[03:08:32.801 --> 03:08:35.963]  Then we'll zoom in next segment and drill into all these other facets.
[03:08:35.963 --> 03:08:37.603]  But good to see you there, my friend.
[03:08:37.603 --> 03:08:38.944]  Wow, what a time to be alive.
[03:08:39.778 --> 03:08:40.839]  Isn't it though?
[03:08:40.839 --> 03:08:42.040]  Thank you for having me on, Alex.
[03:08:42.040 --> 03:08:54.308]  So Ukraine, breaking news just today, announced that they're banning all exports of wheat and buckwheat, oats, I think barley, millet, meat and other crops in order to try to protect their own domestic supply.
[03:08:54.308 --> 03:08:59.892]  Now the reason this matters, and this is on the heels of Hungary a few days ago banning exports of wheat there,
[03:09:00.632 --> 03:09:00.852]  I think?
[03:09:20.929 --> 03:09:25.996]  In South America, we've had drought across the western United States for the last growing season.
[03:09:25.996 --> 03:09:28.579]  In China, they've had extreme floods.
[03:09:28.579 --> 03:09:33.185]  And then in Europe, they are no longer going to be able to produce fertilizer.
[03:09:33.185 --> 03:09:36.250]  This is a key thing that we are going to talk about here today, I hope.
[03:09:36.730 --> 03:09:42.653]  Which is that the nitrogen-based fertilizers are produced from natural gas.
[03:09:42.653 --> 03:09:56.860]  And so you have to have hydrocarbons, which typically come out of Russia, and they go through the pipelines into Germany and other Western European nations, ultimately, in order to produce ammonia, which is the basis for the nitrogen-based fertilizers.
[03:09:58.201 --> 03:10:00.363]  I know you appreciate this, Alex.
[03:10:00.363 --> 03:10:01.664]  This is critical.
[03:10:01.664 --> 03:10:04.706]  You can't make fertilizer from solar panels.
[03:10:04.706 --> 03:10:08.068]  You can't make fertilizer out of wind farms.
[03:10:08.068 --> 03:10:12.931]  You can't make fertilizer out of hydroelectric dams generating electricity.
[03:10:12.931 --> 03:10:15.012]  You need hydrocarbons.
[03:10:15.012 --> 03:10:17.314]  And the equation, it's in my article today.
[03:10:17.314 --> 03:10:23.718]  I've got three key equations for those who want to put on their nerd caps today and study the equations.
[03:10:23.718 --> 03:10:26.220]  But we all need to understand the Haber equation.
[03:10:26.880 --> 03:10:39.431]  Photosynthesis and hydrocarbon combustion, and how those three things now interrelate, and how the globalists are weaponizing all of this in order to cause global famine.
[03:10:39.431 --> 03:10:51.921]  And my prediction, Alex, and I'll turn it back to you, my prediction is by the end of this year, one to two billion people on planet Earth will face starvation because of what's been set into motion in the last two weeks.
[03:10:52.802 --> 03:10:58.144]  And again, you're explaining to people what the mainline scientists and the major head funds and all of them are saying.
[03:10:58.144 --> 03:10:59.344]  This is not debatable.
[03:10:59.344 --> 03:11:09.327]  We can argue some fine points of how bad it's going to be, but this is a pretty conservative breakdown you've got here, that if you cut off the food supply, people starve.
[03:11:09.327 --> 03:11:11.928]  And in this equation, it's simple math.
[03:11:12.731 --> 03:11:13.933]  We're good to go.
[03:11:29.534 --> 03:11:38.237]  Well, I don't care who you blame, the point is this is the Great Reset, and most of the damage has been caused by the ongoing lockdowns that the IMF and World Bank demanded.
[03:11:38.237 --> 03:11:40.918]  In the third world, some countries are still under lockdown.
[03:11:40.918 --> 03:11:44.320]  I mean, this is crazy, and it's all been planned, Mike, as you've said.
[03:11:45.376 --> 03:11:53.539]  Yes, and understand that half the world's population, about 4 billion people, are only alive today because of hydrocarbon-based fertilizers.
[03:11:53.539 --> 03:11:56.119]  Through that process, I just described the Haber equation.
[03:11:56.119 --> 03:11:59.180]  Now understand, you know, plants need nitrogen.
[03:11:59.180 --> 03:12:01.941]  Nitrogen is about 80% of the atmosphere.
[03:12:01.941 --> 03:12:06.443]  We're swimming in a nitrogen soup in gaseous form all around us every day.
[03:12:06.443 --> 03:12:10.824]  But plants can't use that nitrogen until it's combined with hydrocarbons.
[03:12:11.244 --> 03:12:14.946]  From typically from natural gas, but they can also use methane and so on.
[03:12:14.946 --> 03:12:29.454]  And so that that Haber process, which requires big industrial plants, you have to have 200 times atmospheric pressure and so on in order to kind of crush these elements into a new molecule, which is the ammonia molecule or NH3.
[03:12:29.454 --> 03:12:30.715]  N is nitrogen from the air.
[03:12:30.715 --> 03:12:33.876]  H is the hydrogen from hydrocarbons.
[03:12:33.876 --> 03:12:35.257]  That's how you get ammonia.
[03:12:35.257 --> 03:12:38.219]  So now we have a global shortage of ammonia.
[03:12:39.079 --> 03:12:41.461]  And Russia cutting off fertilizer exports.
[03:12:41.461 --> 03:12:45.105]  Russia produces a massive amount of fertilizer for the world.
[03:12:45.105 --> 03:12:49.149]  And Belarus also produces a tremendous amount of potash.
[03:12:49.149 --> 03:12:53.993]  So remember, you need phosphorus and you need potassium, in addition to nitrogen, in order for crops to grow.
[03:12:53.993 --> 03:12:58.618]  Well, if you cut off the thing that feeds 4 billion people,
[03:12:59.679 --> 03:13:01.260]  What happens to the four billion people?
[03:13:01.260 --> 03:13:06.944]  So, as you've been saying, Alex, I've been listening the last couple of days intently about what you're saying.
[03:13:06.944 --> 03:13:09.866]  This is a global reset cover story.
[03:13:09.866 --> 03:13:18.673]  They're going to blame Russia while they crush food supplies, crush fertilizer, crush energy, crash the economies, but then it's all going to be Putin's fault.
[03:13:19.133 --> 03:13:20.314]  That's what they're setting up.
[03:13:20.314 --> 03:13:21.194]  You're absolutely right.
[03:13:21.194 --> 03:13:24.977]  And the globalists, whether they're in France or Australia or here in the U.S., they brag.
[03:13:24.977 --> 03:13:31.481]  Psaki and the head of the energy department and Buttigieg, the head of transportation, they all say, oh, it's a transition.
[03:13:31.481 --> 03:13:33.863]  Yeah, we could cut the price, but we're not.
[03:13:33.863 --> 03:13:37.285]  But it's not a transition onto where we have windmills and they work our solar panels.
[03:13:37.285 --> 03:13:45.211]  It's a transition where the third world starves to death and then who survives flood the first world and then they collapse the first world as well.
[03:13:45.211 --> 03:13:47.812]  This is how we own nothing and have nothing by 2030, Mike.
[03:13:49.440 --> 03:13:54.945]  Right, and when they say zero emissions, the only way to achieve zero emissions is to have zero population.
[03:13:54.945 --> 03:13:59.329]  So it's really the Bill Gates equation that he presented at that TED Talk the one time.
[03:13:59.329 --> 03:14:04.074]  Like he says, one of these variables has to go to zero, and one of them is P for population.
[03:14:04.694 --> 03:14:10.116]  So zero emissions, the only way you get there is through mass global starvation or killing people off.
[03:14:10.116 --> 03:14:25.282]  And we're in a very strange situation right now where the only way that there might be enough food to feed people for the next one to two years is if the vaccine die-off accelerates so rapidly that billions are killed and therefore billions won't starve.
[03:14:25.282 --> 03:14:28.443]  So the real question now is what's going to kill you first?
[03:14:28.983 --> 03:14:35.445]  Is it the spike protein bioweapon, the mRNA injections that alter your chromosomes and turn you into a bioweapons factory?
[03:14:35.445 --> 03:14:46.268]  Or is it starvation and famine that's been engineered by the weaponization of the food system and the economic sanctions causing the cutoff of exports of grains and fertilizers and energy?
[03:14:46.268 --> 03:14:46.908]  That's the question.
[03:14:46.908 --> 03:14:48.889]  It's kind of like, how are we going to die?
[03:14:49.369 --> 03:14:50.570]  Pick your poison.
[03:14:50.570 --> 03:14:54.891]  We're going to come back and get more into the math on this, but you've said it, I've said it.
[03:14:54.891 --> 03:15:02.134]  How are they going to get away with injecting millions of people with a soft kill weapon while they've got to have a new bioweapon or a new war or a financial collapse?
[03:15:02.134 --> 03:15:04.735]  Something that's so horrible, much worse than the last thing.
[03:15:05.715 --> 03:15:07.336]  That happens as an intense event.
[03:15:07.336 --> 03:15:10.237]  It's not, in the aggregate, worse than the bio-attack that just happened.
[03:15:10.237 --> 03:15:11.137]  It's a soft kill.
[03:15:11.137 --> 03:15:16.600]  But it's so big and dramatic, it smokescreens what they already did to us, and now here we are.
[03:15:16.600 --> 03:15:17.240]  We knew it.
[03:15:17.240 --> 03:15:18.501]  We both predicted war.
[03:15:18.501 --> 03:15:22.282]  And so we're going to come back and ask Mike Adams, what comes next?
[03:15:22.282 --> 03:15:24.543]  What's the next shoe to drop after this?
[03:15:24.543 --> 03:15:28.345]  And is there a way to reverse this countdown to extinction?
[03:15:28.905 --> 03:15:30.326]  This countdown to Armageddon.
[03:15:30.326 --> 03:15:36.529]  NaturalNews.com, incredible flagship of Liberty, InfoWars.com, the tip of the spear.
[03:15:36.529 --> 03:15:44.472]  They wanted us all off the air by now, but we're still here because of you to be on air during this critical time, which gives us a real chance, I think, to mitigate how bad this is going to get.
[03:15:44.472 --> 03:15:45.553]  But it's going to get bad.
[03:15:45.553 --> 03:15:51.436]  So get prepared and get ready, folks, because you're going to look back on 2022 and think it was the good old days.

[03:16:56.465 --> 03:17:02.889]  It has been noted by many a historian, the first casualty of war is the truth.
[03:17:02.889 --> 03:17:07.633]  Then the next big casualty isn't even the people that die.
[03:17:07.633 --> 03:17:09.734]  No, that invariably follows.
[03:17:09.734 --> 03:17:18.020]  But first, there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty, and speech, and massive censorship.
[03:17:18.020 --> 03:17:24.384]  And now across the world, from the United States to Europe, legislation's being introduced that if you
[03:17:25.525 --> 03:17:35.013]  Amplify any, quote, pro-Russian information, you can be censored, you can be arrested, you can be imprisoned.
[03:17:35.013 --> 03:17:47.123]  And of course, now, Canada's introduced legislation that if you have a thought crime, and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online, that you will be censored and arrested.
[03:17:47.743 --> 03:17:53.630]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity.
[03:17:53.630 --> 03:17:55.673]  That makes InfoWars.com more important than ever.
[03:17:57.739 --> 03:18:05.404]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days, with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[03:18:05.404 --> 03:18:13.970]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, Down and Out, is just the thing.
[03:18:13.970 --> 03:18:20.354]  It's our new, faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[03:18:20.974 --> 03:18:25.700]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with Down and Out.
[03:18:25.700 --> 03:18:31.407]  Now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[03:18:31.407 --> 03:18:36.232]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[03:18:36.232 --> 03:18:39.937]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the Passionflower.
[03:18:40.157 --> 03:18:40.818]  We're good to go.
[03:18:56.533 --> 03:19:04.879]  With the World Awakening, I think what's important is that we ride through momentum right now, take advantage of this moment, and I've always had the idea that it's something everybody can do, that every listener can do.
[03:19:04.879 --> 03:19:09.061]  I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to, uh, you know, hang banners over highways.
[03:19:09.061 --> 03:19:13.224]  Imagine a giant banner on a piece of LA land that says, Alex Jones is right.
[03:19:13.224 --> 03:19:16.987]  InfoWars.com, or We Stand With The Truckers, or Rescouts, or whatever.
[03:19:26.553 --> 03:19:30.676]  Banner hangs over highways, and it will be a chain reaction.
[03:19:30.676 --> 03:19:32.737]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[03:19:32.737 --> 03:19:33.818]  I have a few ideas.
[03:19:33.818 --> 03:19:36.680]  First of all, Alex Jones is running for the Arkansas farm.
[03:19:36.680 --> 03:19:37.500]  Arrest Fauci.
[03:19:37.500 --> 03:19:38.501]  Arrest Fox Schwab.
[03:19:38.501 --> 03:19:39.542]  The vaccine is poison.
[03:19:39.542 --> 03:19:40.362]  There's tons of things.
[03:19:40.362 --> 03:19:41.383]  I say, keep it short.
[03:19:41.383 --> 03:19:41.823]  Keep it concise.
[03:19:41.823 --> 03:19:42.844]  No, I agree.
[03:19:42.844 --> 03:19:43.785]  Arrest Fauci.
[03:19:43.785 --> 03:19:44.885]  Arrest Bill Gates.
[03:19:44.885 --> 03:19:46.486]  The COVID vax is poison.
[03:19:46.486 --> 03:19:46.927]  Beautiful.
[03:19:46.927 --> 03:19:49.849]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved, that we could all be affected.
[03:19:49.849 --> 03:19:51.229]  So, that's what I'm calling about.
[03:19:51.229 --> 03:19:52.150]  God bless you, Chris.
[03:19:52.150 --> 03:19:55.532]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[03:19:55.532 --> 03:19:56.173]  Thank you so much.
[03:19:58.894 --> 03:20:09.601]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:09.601 --> 03:20:23.429]  Alright, final segment I'm hosting, because I want Mike Adams to really be able to roll the next two long segments coming up out of the War Room, 3P and Central, and then 4Wars.com for its live show and band-on video, and stations across the country with Owen Schroyer.
[03:20:24.707 --> 03:20:27.008]  But I see the awakening as very positive.
[03:20:27.008 --> 03:20:29.530]  As negative as all this is, it's really an opportunity.
[03:20:29.530 --> 03:20:30.330]  I know Mike agrees.
[03:20:30.330 --> 03:20:31.951]  I listen to his show.
[03:20:31.951 --> 03:20:36.294]  For those of us that are aware, we're going to be the leaders and help build the new future.
[03:20:36.294 --> 03:20:39.656]  And the power elite that are in control now are going to burn themselves out and really fail.
[03:20:40.436 --> 03:20:41.156]  They are failing.
[03:20:41.156 --> 03:20:43.778]  Many of their agendas are falling apart and waking people up.
[03:20:43.778 --> 03:20:46.399]  But then that makes them double down, double down, double down.
[03:20:46.399 --> 03:20:47.619]  So it looks like they're winning.
[03:20:47.619 --> 03:20:49.300]  In my view, they're actually failing.
[03:20:49.300 --> 03:20:51.661]  But it's still going to be extremely destructive.
[03:20:51.661 --> 03:20:54.042]  But I got to tell you, I travel around the country.
[03:20:54.042 --> 03:20:54.803]  I go all over the place.
[03:20:54.803 --> 03:20:56.864]  And Mike Adams has been around for 20 years.
[03:20:56.864 --> 03:20:57.824]  He's reached so many people.
[03:20:57.824 --> 03:21:00.966]  But now all the time, oh, I love Mike Adams.
[03:21:00.966 --> 03:21:05.368]  Oh, and I love... So just to see the buzz out there for Mike increasing is great.
[03:21:06.374 --> 03:21:17.922]  Because that's another bellwether of how folks are really getting it, because, you know, Mike Adams is a scientist, and he's got hardcore info, and it's shocking, but it's what people need to know to be able to stop this.
[03:21:17.922 --> 03:21:21.885]  So, you've got a lot coming up in the next two segments, but you heard my question.
[03:21:21.885 --> 03:21:26.788]  We obviously predicted war, now I think cyber attacks, maybe a new bio-release.
[03:21:26.788 --> 03:21:29.430]  The globalists are just getting started, in my view.
[03:21:29.430 --> 03:21:33.553]  What do you think they're going to launch next as they go from crisis to crisis?
[03:21:35.379 --> 03:21:38.520]  Okay, well, and by the way, thanks for blowing my cover there, Alex.
[03:21:38.520 --> 03:21:44.923]  I was pretending that I have no influence whatsoever, so that maybe they would leave me alone.
[03:21:44.923 --> 03:21:49.624]  Just trying to hide out a little bit, you know, in the corners of the truth, right?
[03:21:49.624 --> 03:21:50.745]  But, in any case...
[03:21:51.585 --> 03:21:52.766]  Here's what we're facing.
[03:21:52.766 --> 03:21:56.768]  Number one, there's no new farmland on the planet, really.
[03:21:56.768 --> 03:22:00.990]  There are slight increases in places like Brazil, maybe 1%, 2% a year.
[03:22:00.990 --> 03:22:04.572]  But there's really no new farmland, no new continent to grow food.
[03:22:04.572 --> 03:22:12.516]  And so you only have this set amount of dirt, of land, and the soils are being depleted through erosion, by the way.
[03:22:12.516 --> 03:22:14.958]  There are really only two ways to increase crop yields.
[03:22:15.918 --> 03:22:22.219]  One way is through fertilizer, which we've talked about, and for that reason, half the people of the world are able to eat.
[03:22:22.219 --> 03:22:27.141]  The second way is to have higher concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere.
[03:22:27.141 --> 03:22:30.821]  If you raise the level of CO2, crop yields explode.
[03:22:30.821 --> 03:22:33.842]  If you want to grow more crops, you need more CO2.
[03:22:33.842 --> 03:22:35.262]  So what are the globalists doing?
[03:22:35.262 --> 03:22:38.043]  They're sucking the CO2 out of the air.
[03:22:38.683 --> 03:22:39.303]  We're good to go.
[03:22:55.075 --> 03:22:59.981]  And Mike, think of what a victory for anti-science this is, because you go through the equations in your latest article.
[03:22:59.981 --> 03:23:09.211]  We have sunlight, we have water, we have chlorophyll, we have these different base gases that the plants need combined to be able to live and survive.
[03:23:10.072 --> 03:23:14.996]  And they're literally attacking it at its base of carbon dioxide.
[03:23:14.996 --> 03:23:20.620]  And the average person doesn't know that that's literally like saying, let's get rid of water on planet Earth, or let's get rid of sunlight.
[03:23:20.620 --> 03:23:22.942]  I mean, those are the things you've got to have.
[03:23:22.942 --> 03:23:27.265]  And exactly, they've got a war on carbon, which is a war on life.
[03:23:27.265 --> 03:23:33.089]  And we know the Earth had a much higher carbon before, for a lot of reasons, but volcanoes and other things were more active.
[03:23:33.089 --> 03:23:36.452]  And so they're literally attacking something that we need
[03:23:37.172 --> 03:23:39.874]  Is this carbon that's bound in the earth that's part of our life cycle?
[03:23:39.874 --> 03:23:48.058]  It's just insane that they're able to brainwash and train the public to literally hate the oxygen of plants.
[03:23:48.058 --> 03:23:50.679]  We have oxygen, they have carbon dioxide.
[03:23:50.679 --> 03:23:51.720]  That's the life cycle.
[03:23:51.720 --> 03:23:53.761]  To be able to teach people this is insane.
[03:23:55.097 --> 03:24:05.446]  Yes, and think about hydrocarbons, or fossil fuels, are really stored plant food that is released to the crops of the world when you burn hydrocarbons.
[03:24:05.446 --> 03:24:14.373]  So hydrocarbons, in a molecular format, are basically just C and H. That's the name hydrocarbon or hydrogen and carbon, but it's typically CH.
[03:24:14.373 --> 03:24:17.476]  You burn it in the presence of oxygen, or O2.
[03:24:17.476 --> 03:24:19.477]  You get only two outputs, Alex.
[03:24:19.477 --> 03:24:23.701]  One of those is plant food, which is CO2, and the other output is water.
[03:24:24.241 --> 03:24:30.685]  So if you burn hydrocarbons, you're creating food for crops and water that can water crops.
[03:24:30.685 --> 03:24:32.826]  So there's nothing negative about that.
[03:24:32.826 --> 03:24:36.047]  It's not pollution, it's actually sustaining life.
[03:24:36.047 --> 03:24:47.654]  And when you have higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, and NASA imagery has proven this, they've been taking images while CO2 has been slowly rising into like 409 parts per million or whatever it is right now.
[03:24:48.334 --> 03:24:50.855]  The Earth is greening more and more.
[03:24:50.855 --> 03:24:55.116]  Now Alex, remember when I said there's only a limited amount of farmland on the planet?
[03:24:55.116 --> 03:25:00.477]  The way to create more farmland is to raise CO2 levels in the atmosphere.
[03:25:00.477 --> 03:25:03.138]  Then you can turn deserts into farmland.
[03:25:03.138 --> 03:25:06.679]  Then you have new acreage in which to grow food.
[03:25:06.679 --> 03:25:10.400]  And explain that to people because I've seen the studies that they're mind-blowing.
[03:25:10.400 --> 03:25:16.882]  Just a little bit of CO2 going up makes plants need less water, makes them more hardy, makes them grow faster.
[03:25:16.882 --> 03:25:17.462]  It's incredible.
[03:25:18.973 --> 03:25:29.516]  Well, there are experiments where they've attached greenhouses to coal-fired power plants so that the output of the coal burning, which contains CO2, becomes food for the greenhouse.
[03:25:29.516 --> 03:25:30.377]  And it grows plants.
[03:25:30.377 --> 03:25:34.558]  And that's a very smart way to use these two natural resources on planet Earth.
[03:25:34.558 --> 03:25:36.519]  And then what do those evil plants do?
[03:25:36.519 --> 03:25:39.560]  The evil plants create oxygen and even more deadly gas.
[03:25:39.560 --> 03:25:39.980]  That's right.
[03:25:40.980 --> 03:25:41.860]  And food.
[03:25:41.860 --> 03:25:45.801]  So again, you want to grow more food, you need more CO2, not less.
[03:25:45.801 --> 03:25:54.662]  But if you raise the CO2 level in the atmosphere, then deserts can become grasslands, grasslands can become forests or rainforests.
[03:25:54.662 --> 03:25:56.443]  Or you can use them for farming.
[03:25:56.443 --> 03:26:02.024]  Areas that can't be farmed today will be able to be farmed when CO2 levels are higher.
[03:26:02.024 --> 03:26:08.505]  And with higher levels of CO2, which existed in the history of the Earth, you have a wetter, warmer planet.
[03:26:08.505 --> 03:26:09.105]  More lush.
[03:26:09.845 --> 03:26:12.470]  More diversity of life in rainforests.
[03:26:12.470 --> 03:26:16.136]  There are studies that show more flowers are blooming.
[03:26:16.136 --> 03:26:19.241]  And so why do Democrats and leftists hate rainforests?
[03:26:19.241 --> 03:26:21.144]  Why do they hate rainforest flowers?
[03:26:21.144 --> 03:26:22.126]  Because they hate life.
[03:26:22.126 --> 03:26:22.988]  Because they're satanic.
[03:26:23.908 --> 03:26:24.488]  That's right.
[03:26:24.488 --> 03:26:25.369]  They hate life.
[03:26:25.369 --> 03:26:25.890]  You nailed it.
[03:26:25.890 --> 03:26:27.671]  I mean, that's exactly it.
[03:26:27.671 --> 03:26:39.020]  You know, Maryland is proposing a new law that would allow you to murder babies 28 days after they're born because for some reason they think that on day 29 that would be an evil act.
[03:26:39.020 --> 03:26:42.182]  So, these are the kind of lunatics we're dealing with.
[03:26:42.182 --> 03:26:43.643]  I saw that report, didn't even get to it.
[03:26:43.643 --> 03:26:44.003]  Incredible.
[03:26:44.003 --> 03:26:45.725]  Alright, you're about to take over.
[03:26:45.725 --> 03:26:47.186]  Mike Adams, what are you going to cover when you come back?
[03:26:48.399 --> 03:26:56.246]  Well, of course, a little bit more about hydrocarbons, what people need to understand about your own food supply, how to navigate and survive this.
[03:26:56.246 --> 03:27:15.301]  Also, I want to talk about how I think we've reached a tipping point for widespread global crypto-embracing, because the banks have been weaponized against the people, and I think every person needs to become proficient in crypto in order to move money and not be subject to the illegal confiscation that governments and banks are carrying.
[03:27:15.301 --> 03:27:15.842]  Well, that's right.
[03:27:15.842 --> 03:27:17.103]  I saw what you were saying two weeks ago.
[03:27:17.583 --> 03:27:18.584]  They were going after the truckers.
[03:27:18.584 --> 03:27:21.186]  You said this is going to make crypto go back up, and it is going back up.
[03:27:21.186 --> 03:27:24.448]  Mike Adams takes over in four minutes when we come back from break.
[03:27:24.448 --> 03:27:30.452]  For listeners, folks, I know you're awake, but your friends and your family are awake to waking up.
[03:27:30.452 --> 03:27:31.933]  They're not awake yet, many of them.
[03:27:31.933 --> 03:27:38.938]  People are ready, to use the plant analogy, the ground is very fertile, there's water, there's sunlight, you know, the tyranny wakes them up.
[03:27:38.938 --> 03:27:40.820]  People need to get the articles and videos now.
[03:27:40.820 --> 03:27:43.982]  You need to share this interview with Mike Adams once it's archived.
[03:27:43.982 --> 03:27:46.424]  You need to share this information that you know,
[03:27:47.125 --> 03:27:48.250]  People don't know it.
[03:27:48.250 --> 03:27:49.675]  And I know you know that.
[03:27:49.675 --> 03:27:52.686]  I'm just trying to remind listeners of how damn important you are.
[03:27:53.584 --> 03:27:55.765]  It's like if a plant doesn't have carbon dioxide, it dies.
[03:27:55.765 --> 03:27:57.807]  If you don't share this show, we die.
[03:27:57.807 --> 03:27:58.707]  We all die together.
[03:27:58.707 --> 03:27:59.828]  It's that simple.
[03:27:59.828 --> 03:28:02.709]  Separately, everybody's got runs on iodine.
[03:28:02.709 --> 03:28:05.391]  We've got high quality tri-iodine, all the good iodines you need.
[03:28:05.391 --> 03:28:09.574]  Even though it's going to sell out in like a week now, 50% off because I want you to get it.
[03:28:09.574 --> 03:28:13.056]  Same thing, our vitamin D3 winter sun, it's going to sell out in a matter of days.
[03:28:13.056 --> 03:28:15.017]  We're keeping it 50% off.
[03:28:15.017 --> 03:28:18.359]  Infowarstore.com because I've got to get funds in to operate.
[03:28:18.359 --> 03:28:20.380]  Also, we have the great nootropic.
[03:28:20.920 --> 03:28:24.561]  Brain Force Ultra hits really quick and dissipates fast.
[03:28:24.561 --> 03:28:28.062]  Unlike Turbo Force and unlike Brain Force Plus that last a long time.
[03:28:28.062 --> 03:28:29.843]  They're totally different formulas.
[03:28:29.843 --> 03:28:30.423]  They're all great.
[03:28:30.423 --> 03:28:31.243]  They're all different.
[03:28:31.243 --> 03:28:36.305]  But if you like them, you're really going to love Brain Force Plus and of course Brain Force Ultra.
[03:28:36.445 --> 03:28:37.746]  Ultra, the new product.
[03:28:37.746 --> 03:28:38.786]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:28:38.786 --> 03:28:40.347]  It's 40% off.
[03:28:40.347 --> 03:28:42.068]  Get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt.
[03:28:42.068 --> 03:28:45.170]  A lot of you don't have water filtration, portable, with what's coming.
[03:28:45.170 --> 03:28:47.151]  That's something you've got to have as well.
[03:28:47.151 --> 03:28:51.493]  We've got an Alexa Pure Pro, one of the highest rated systems at a very low price.
[03:28:51.493 --> 03:28:52.613]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:28:52.613 --> 03:28:53.514]  Mike Adams takes over.
[03:28:58.160 --> 03:28:58.901]  So I did it.
[03:28:58.901 --> 03:29:01.023]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[03:29:01.023 --> 03:29:08.572]  I've been training, probably not as much as I should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:08.572 --> 03:29:14.379]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some TurboForce to give me that energy I need to get going.
[03:29:14.379 --> 03:29:16.722]  You know, besides the energy, TurboForce
[03:29:17.242 --> 03:29:27.944]  It is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[03:29:27.944 --> 03:29:31.805]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones Soreless.
[03:29:31.805 --> 03:29:33.025]  I have bad joints.
[03:29:33.025 --> 03:29:33.925]  Thanks, Mom.
[03:29:33.925 --> 03:29:41.006]  So, this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[03:29:41.006 --> 03:29:44.987]  The quick-release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[03:29:45.447 --> 03:29:57.192]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, TurboForce, that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day, and Soreless can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[03:29:57.192 --> 03:30:04.135]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[03:30:04.135 --> 03:30:09.558]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[03:30:09.998 --> 03:30:16.682]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars Store.
[03:30:16.682 --> 03:30:23.905]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[03:30:23.905 --> 03:30:34.191]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[03:30:34.591 --> 03:30:43.598]  As for Vitamin C and Zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[03:30:43.598 --> 03:30:50.204]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[03:30:50.204 --> 03:30:56.429]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InforWearStore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[03:30:56.749 --> 03:30:59.291]  No end run contact tracers aren't coming.
[03:30:59.291 --> 03:31:00.191]  They're here.
[03:31:00.191 --> 03:31:01.132]  All over the world.
[03:31:01.132 --> 03:31:02.973]  From Australia to the United States.
[03:31:02.973 --> 03:31:04.514]  From Canada to Germany.
[03:31:04.514 --> 03:31:07.436]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go.
[03:31:07.436 --> 03:31:14.921]  And they're coming to your house and threatening, in some cases actually, taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[03:31:14.921 --> 03:31:23.187]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[03:31:23.487 --> 03:31:25.310]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[03:31:25.310 --> 03:31:33.102]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S.
[03:31:33.102 --> 03:31:36.467]  government military grade at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:36.467 --> 03:31:38.370]  We have the entire line of silent
[03:31:38.490 --> 03:31:38.770]  I think so.
[03:31:57.990 --> 03:32:03.234]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022.
[03:32:03.234 --> 03:32:22.046]  And in the month of February, we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product X3 that has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much.
[03:32:22.046 --> 03:32:25.929]  And the majority of the population of the world is iodine deficient.
[03:32:25.929 --> 03:32:27.430]  This is the very best iodine out there.
[03:32:28.270 --> 03:32:33.973]  We had it on sale at 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or is it going to come in for a long time?
[03:32:33.973 --> 03:32:36.014]  So I took it back to full price.
[03:32:36.014 --> 03:32:37.595]  So I was just thinking, you know what?
[03:32:37.595 --> 03:32:39.936]  We need the funds in now to stay on air.
[03:32:39.936 --> 03:32:42.317]  Plus, this is a great product everybody needs.
[03:32:42.317 --> 03:32:51.862]  So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience it for yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out.
[03:32:51.862 --> 03:32:55.303]  Get X3 right now exclusively at InfowarsStore.com for 50% off.
[03:32:58.143 --> 03:33:04.061]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:33:15.748 --> 03:33:17.890]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.890 --> 03:33:26.599]  Fourth hour here, Mike Adams, and I've been handed this segment and the next segment to carry out the rest of this hour.
[03:33:26.599 --> 03:33:30.503]  So thank you for having me on, Alex, and we're going to cover today here.
[03:33:31.544 --> 03:33:37.010]  Some things that you need to be able to know how to do to protect yourself from the global famine that's already been engineered.
[03:33:37.010 --> 03:33:38.311]  It's set in stone.
[03:33:38.311 --> 03:33:40.633]  So point number one is that you can't stop this.
[03:33:40.633 --> 03:33:44.477]  None of us can, because it takes time to grow plants.
[03:33:44.477 --> 03:33:47.459]  And crops are already... Well, think about it this way.
[03:33:48.220 --> 03:33:51.323]  A lot of the food we're eating now is last year's crops.
[03:33:51.323 --> 03:34:03.013]  So the winter wheat and last year's corn and soy that was grown often in the fall or processed over the winter in different parts of the world depending on the climate.
[03:34:03.013 --> 03:34:04.194]  What's happening now is we have
[03:34:07.003 --> 03:34:22.828]  Shortages of fertilizer, shortages of crops, shortages of energy, and then extremely high increases of prices of the diesel fuel that's used to transport food as well as to run the tractors and the agricultural equipment that creates food.
[03:34:22.828 --> 03:34:25.929]  So this shockwave begins now.
[03:34:25.929 --> 03:34:29.890]  This shockwave will not be fully felt until later this summer.
[03:34:30.891 --> 03:34:34.396]  And then it's going to continue to last for the next one to two years.
[03:34:34.396 --> 03:34:35.778]  That's my prediction.
[03:34:35.778 --> 03:34:42.266]  So you're not going to see the store shelves going empty tomorrow because we still have a little bit of a buffer in the system.
[03:34:43.075 --> 03:34:46.659]  But in late summer, it's going to get very bad.
[03:34:46.659 --> 03:34:48.381]  And in the fall, even worse.
[03:34:48.381 --> 03:34:55.949]  And by the winter, my prediction is, again, 1 to 2 billion people on this planet will face the real possibility of starvation.
[03:34:55.949 --> 03:35:02.275]  We're talking about food scarcity or food insecurity, as it's called, on a massive scale.
[03:35:02.275 --> 03:35:03.477]  And again, 1 to 2 billion people.
[03:35:04.482 --> 03:35:05.082]  We'll be affected.
[03:35:05.082 --> 03:35:06.703]  And that's if things don't get worse.
[03:35:06.703 --> 03:35:14.887]  If things get worse, and we have a nuclear exchange, then you have Cesium-137 contamination of soils.
[03:35:14.887 --> 03:35:18.069]  Now Cesium-137 is a radioisotope.
[03:35:18.069 --> 03:35:29.715]  It's part of the fallout from Fukushima, from Chernobyl, from 1986, and it's the reason why you can't grow crops right now in northern Ukraine near the Chernobyl site.
[03:35:30.635 --> 03:35:41.823]  Season 137, because it has a half-life of about 20, what is it, 29 years or so, remember you need 10 half-lives in order for that to be considered gone from the environment.
[03:35:41.823 --> 03:35:45.366]  So 10 half-lives is roughly three centuries.
[03:35:45.366 --> 03:35:52.131]  300 years is what it's going to take to get back the farmland and make it usable if we have a nuclear exchange.
[03:35:52.751 --> 03:35:58.494]  So anywhere the fallout happens, just to say one more time, you can't use the farms for 300 years.
[03:35:58.494 --> 03:36:00.275]  What is that going to do to the global food supply?
[03:36:00.275 --> 03:36:03.557]  Obviously, billions are going to starve.
[03:36:03.557 --> 03:36:05.698]  Just bluntly stated.
[03:36:05.698 --> 03:36:11.942]  The second thing to realize is that Cesium-137 mimics the biological pathways of Potassium.
[03:36:11.942 --> 03:36:15.023]  So it goes everywhere in plants that Potassium goes.
[03:36:15.023 --> 03:36:17.525]  And Potassium is one of the key nutrients to grow plants.
[03:36:17.525 --> 03:36:19.186]  It's one of the key fertilizers, right?
[03:36:19.186 --> 03:36:21.067]  Nitrogen, Potassium, and Phosphorus.
[03:36:21.787 --> 03:36:33.758]  So, when you eat those plants, or when cows eat those plants, if they contain cesium-137, then those cows become, well, they produce radioactive milk.
[03:36:33.758 --> 03:36:42.685]  And this is one of the key ways that people are exposed to radiation after a nuclear event is through milk, through water, through food, through crops.
[03:36:42.685 --> 03:36:44.387]  So understand what's at stake here.
[03:36:46.008 --> 03:36:56.759]  Cesium-137 is a different isotope, obviously, than iodine-131, which is the nuclear fallout isotope that can kill you and burn out your thyroid and so on.
[03:36:56.759 --> 03:37:00.744]  But that has a half-life of only, I think it's seven or eight days.
[03:37:00.744 --> 03:37:02.325]  It's very short compared to cesium.
[03:37:03.226 --> 03:37:08.308]  So ten half-lives of iodine-131 is only about ten weeks.
[03:37:08.308 --> 03:37:25.196]  And if you wait three weeks before going outside after a nuclear fallout event, like literally living indoors for three weeks, then the level of iodine-131 will be cut to one-eighth, because that's three halvings, obviously.
[03:37:25.196 --> 03:37:27.557]  And wait another week and it'll be one-sixteenth, and so on.
[03:37:29.488 --> 03:37:37.751]  Oh, by the way, the InfoWars store iodine, I was just asking the crew during their break, do you have that in inventory?
[03:37:37.751 --> 03:37:39.212]  The X, I think it's the X2?
[03:37:39.212 --> 03:37:40.392]  Yeah.
[03:37:40.392 --> 03:37:42.253]  And they said yes, they do have it in inventory.
[03:37:42.253 --> 03:37:43.653]  Or X3, I'm sorry.
[03:37:43.653 --> 03:37:44.874]  Maybe it's two different versions.
[03:37:44.874 --> 03:37:51.256]  But Alex had the foresight to order a tremendous quantity of this, and I think it took a long time to get it.
[03:37:51.256 --> 03:37:54.117]  I think they waited almost a year to get it in stock.
[03:37:54.117 --> 03:37:56.098]  And wouldn't you know it, now that they have it in stock,
[03:37:56.798 --> 03:37:57.919]  It's not going to last very long.
[03:37:57.919 --> 03:38:06.788]  I'm telling you folks, if you want some iodine, go to Infowars store right now and get it because it's not going to last very long and it'll be difficult to get more.
[03:38:06.788 --> 03:38:12.573]  And the other secret of iodine is it is an element and it stores almost forever.
[03:38:13.601 --> 03:38:15.723]  I mean, I know they can't say that legally on their labels.
[03:38:15.723 --> 03:38:18.826]  They have to have an expiration date, you know, for FDA.
[03:38:18.826 --> 03:38:21.048]  I think of typically two years or something like that.
[03:38:21.048 --> 03:38:30.937]  But I'm just telling you as a scientist, if you have liquid iodine, like in alcohol or other solutions, it doesn't go bad.
[03:38:30.937 --> 03:38:34.661]  It's not like a vitamin C molecule or a plant nutrient molecule.
[03:38:34.661 --> 03:38:35.362]  It's an element.
[03:38:36.320 --> 03:38:40.784]  It's just in an elemental or simple molecular form.
[03:38:40.784 --> 03:38:41.745]  It's not going to go bad.
[03:38:41.745 --> 03:38:47.811]  So that's a lifetime investment in something that you're going to have on the shelf for the rest of your life, frankly.
[03:38:47.811 --> 03:38:49.133]  I mean, that's my view on it.
[03:38:50.711 --> 03:38:53.974]  Okay, but getting back to what's going to happen with food and what you can do.
[03:38:53.974 --> 03:39:13.468]  Understand that if you can go out and purchase some fertilizers right now, even at relatively small quantities like a 50-pound bag of a nitrogen-based fertilizer that's used in farming and in hydroponic production, understand that that fertilizer represents the potential for future food.
[03:39:14.716 --> 03:39:20.361]  So storing fertilizer, and then having some seeds, and then having a way to grow that food.
[03:39:20.361 --> 03:39:27.808]  Not just in soil, but also in what I advocate, what's called suspended net pot non-circulating hydroponic systems.
[03:39:27.808 --> 03:39:30.390]  It's also known as the Kratky system.
[03:39:30.390 --> 03:39:32.792]  K-R-A-T-K-Y, Kratky.
[03:39:33.433 --> 03:39:37.177]  And I encourage you, that's what I do, I grow food like crazy using this system.
[03:39:37.177 --> 03:39:51.794]  You use a little tiny amount of fertilizer, you stir it into the water in that system, and I'm growing just massive amounts of lettuce and herbs and kale and proteins and natural medicine and basil and all kinds of things, wild onions.
[03:39:51.794 --> 03:39:52.495]  It's incredible.
[03:39:53.570 --> 03:39:58.831]  So, investing in fertilizer makes a lot of sense in this environment right now.
[03:39:58.831 --> 03:40:01.272]  Because, you know, you think about storing food.
[03:40:01.272 --> 03:40:02.332]  Okay, that's great.
[03:40:02.332 --> 03:40:04.033]  You have a certain amount of food.
[03:40:04.033 --> 03:40:08.434]  But the food is eventually going to run out, especially if we have a two-year famine.
[03:40:08.434 --> 03:40:11.115]  You need to have potential for food.
[03:40:11.115 --> 03:40:13.435]  And that's fertilizer, and that's seeds.
[03:40:13.435 --> 03:40:16.156]  But a lot of people own seeds, and they forgot about the fertilizer.
[03:40:16.576 --> 03:40:19.639]  Without the fertilizer, your seed yields are very low.
[03:40:19.639 --> 03:40:30.889]  And if you think about your primary equation when it comes to survival and survival gardening is how many calories are you expending versus how many calories are you getting back out of the food.
[03:40:30.889 --> 03:40:36.994]  And that's why people tend to grow a lot of potatoes in a survival garden because you get a relatively high return.
[03:40:36.994 --> 03:40:43.039]  But if you don't know what you're doing with gardening and you don't have fertilizer, you can starve to death while you're gardening.
[03:40:43.786 --> 03:40:48.147]  You're just not getting the calories to compensate for the effort that it takes to grow the food.
[03:40:48.147 --> 03:40:56.389]  And this is why I advocate, again, the non-circulating suspended net hydroponic system because it requires no pumps, no electricity.
[03:40:56.389 --> 03:40:57.429]  It's super simple.
[03:40:57.429 --> 03:41:04.731]  I mean, it's just the easiest thing imaginable and it takes very little effort because there's no weeding, there's no soil.
[03:41:04.731 --> 03:41:10.072]  There's almost no effort to grow that food and you can live off that food.
[03:41:11.021 --> 03:41:11.081]  I'm
[03:41:42.341 --> 03:41:47.163]  It's critical that you plan ahead for the global famine that's going to take place.
[03:41:47.163 --> 03:41:48.463]  It is set in stone.
[03:41:48.463 --> 03:41:50.204]  Mark my words.
[03:41:50.204 --> 03:41:53.565]  One to two billion people will face starvation by the end of this year.
[03:41:53.565 --> 03:41:57.826]  There's no question about it because there's no magical way to produce food.
[03:41:57.826 --> 03:41:59.006]  It has to be grown.
[03:41:59.006 --> 03:42:05.668]  It takes time and it takes inputs and those inputs have been locked out of the system as of today.
[03:42:05.668 --> 03:42:10.610]  So you have advanced knowledge of this and that's one of the things you know pat yourself on the back.
[03:42:11.786 --> 03:42:24.791]  Thank God for the blessings that you have to be an InfoWars viewer or fan or watching any of the work that any of us do in our podcasts and websites and so on because you have advanced notice.
[03:42:24.791 --> 03:42:30.473]  You almost have a crystal ball time machine and you know what's coming where the masses don't.
[03:42:30.473 --> 03:42:32.254]  So take advantage of that knowledge.
[03:42:32.734 --> 03:42:35.015]  Go through and listen to what I said here.
[03:42:35.015 --> 03:42:36.536]  Get yourself a food growth system.
[03:42:36.536 --> 03:42:37.797]  Get yourself some fertilizers.
[03:42:37.797 --> 03:42:42.859]  Get yourself some seeds and the knowledge to turn that into food so you can survive what's coming.
[03:42:42.859 --> 03:42:47.281]  I'll be back with much more about crypto and other topics straight ahead here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:47.281 --> 03:42:48.042]  I'm Mike Adams.
[03:42:48.042 --> 03:42:49.222]  Stay with us.
[03:42:49.222 --> 03:42:50.343]  We'll be right back after this break.
[03:42:57.751 --> 03:43:02.995]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022.
[03:43:02.995 --> 03:43:21.827]  And in the month of February, we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product X3 that has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much.
[03:43:21.827 --> 03:43:25.730]  And the majority of the population of the world is iodine deficient.
[03:43:25.730 --> 03:43:27.211]  This is the very best iodine out there.
[03:43:28.031 --> 03:43:33.756]  We had it on sale at 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or is it going to come in for a long time?
[03:43:33.756 --> 03:43:35.757]  So I took it back to full price.
[03:43:35.757 --> 03:43:37.378]  And I was just thinking, you know what?
[03:43:37.378 --> 03:43:39.700]  We need the funds in now to stay on air.
[03:43:39.700 --> 03:43:42.082]  Plus, this is a great product everybody needs.
[03:43:42.082 --> 03:43:48.346]  So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence, get X3 and experience it for yourself and support the broadcast.
[03:43:48.346 --> 03:43:51.629]  I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out.
[03:43:51.629 --> 03:43:54.991]  Get X3 right now exclusively at InfowarsStore.com for 50% off.
[03:43:57.483 --> 03:44:05.247]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the foods.
[03:44:05.247 --> 03:44:06.748]  It's all come out.
[03:44:06.748 --> 03:44:13.531]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made in the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful.
[03:44:13.531 --> 03:44:16.753]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[03:44:16.753 --> 03:44:22.516]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with it, but boy, is it true.
[03:44:24.426 --> 03:44:30.233]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[03:44:30.233 --> 03:44:42.468]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world who is a loser.
[03:44:43.008 --> 03:44:46.911]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep Infowars in the air now more than ever.
[03:44:46.911 --> 03:44:52.615]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is satanic.
[03:44:52.615 --> 03:44:56.418]  And we are opposing the one world government and the Mark of the Beast they just announced.
[03:44:57.955 --> 03:45:04.080]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great InfoWars listeners and viewers.
[03:45:04.080 --> 03:45:12.907]  If you will simply get X3 with all three types of good iodine that boost your immune system and help everything that goes on in your body at the cellular level,
[03:45:13.627 --> 03:45:14.747]  It will change your life.
[03:45:14.747 --> 03:45:15.908]  It will invigorate you.
[03:45:15.908 --> 03:45:17.088]  It will empower you.
[03:45:17.088 --> 03:45:20.009]  Almost everyone has iodine deficiency.
[03:45:20.009 --> 03:45:21.589]  Look into it for yourself.
[03:45:21.589 --> 03:45:23.049]  It's the opposite of fluoride.
[03:45:23.049 --> 03:45:25.270]  It's the good halogen.
[03:45:25.270 --> 03:45:28.670]  And then your purchase of X3 funds our operation.
[03:45:28.670 --> 03:45:34.412]  Now a lot of our products have been sold out and never came back in because of the lockdowns and supply chain breakdowns.
[03:45:34.412 --> 03:45:36.832]  They were sold out of X3 for a long time.
[03:45:36.832 --> 03:45:39.573]  And I had it on sale for 50% off and a lot of folks were getting it.
[03:45:39.873 --> 03:45:40.914]  And I was thinking, you know what?
[03:45:40.914 --> 03:45:44.597]  I'm going to bring it back on sale again just until it sells out.
[03:45:44.597 --> 03:45:51.983]  Because even though we won't make as much money in the long run, a lot of folks need this product and we need to get the money from the sales in now to stay on air.
[03:45:51.983 --> 03:45:56.887]  See your X3 right now at 50% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:45:56.887 --> 03:46:05.414]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[03:46:07.088 --> 03:46:09.850]  And when it comes to information, boy is that true.
[03:46:09.850 --> 03:46:17.334]  Today we see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation, great reset combine.
[03:46:17.334 --> 03:46:23.417]  Trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision.
[03:46:23.417 --> 03:46:29.761]  Suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers.
[03:46:30.621 --> 03:46:39.245]  That are exposing all their lies, their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[03:46:39.245 --> 03:46:40.826]  And none of it can succeed.
[03:46:40.826 --> 03:46:46.328]  None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[03:46:46.328 --> 03:46:50.390]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[03:46:50.390 --> 03:46:54.372]  And that's why it's hard to share in full wars links and banned audio links.
[03:46:54.372 --> 03:46:56.253]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[03:46:58.450 --> 03:47:03.074]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:03.074 --> 03:47:04.355]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:47:15.299 --> 03:47:17.921]  Alright, we're back here, folks, on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.921 --> 03:47:24.967]  Mike Adams, the health ranger of NaturalNews.com, and I'm also the founder of Brighteon.com, the free speech video site.
[03:47:24.967 --> 03:47:32.953]  I want to mention about videos, one of the things I strongly recommend that everybody do right now, because we may be looking at an internet shutdown.
[03:47:32.953 --> 03:47:37.837]  There are even rumors of what Russia is doing with disconnection from the internet, I believe, on the 11th.
[03:47:37.837 --> 03:47:39.037]  That's just a couple days away.
[03:47:40.058 --> 03:47:42.140]  But there could be an internet kill switch, a shutdown.
[03:47:42.140 --> 03:47:58.673]  So one of the things that you should probably think about doing is going to all of the video sites that have how-to videos about how to grow food, how to do hydroponics, how to harvest, how to save seeds, all these amazing things, these skills that you need to survive.
[03:47:59.654 --> 03:48:10.718]  And I encourage you to support and visit all the alternative sites, the free speech sites, and then get yourself a video downloader and just download those videos locally.
[03:48:10.718 --> 03:48:20.983]  So, you know, not just Brighttown.com, there's Bitchute, there's Odyssey, there's Rumble, and there's still quite a few videos on YouTube that are good how-to videos that can teach you a lot.
[03:48:20.983 --> 03:48:23.303]  Because there's going to come a day where you don't have the internet.
[03:48:23.303 --> 03:48:24.064]  There's going to come a day
[03:48:24.864 --> 03:48:30.785]  Infowars isn't broadcasting, where I'm not doing podcasts, where natural news is offline, and so on.
[03:48:30.785 --> 03:48:35.346]  And where, frankly, the entire ecosystem is offline, probably.
[03:48:35.346 --> 03:48:36.547]  That day is coming.
[03:48:36.547 --> 03:48:44.969]  And it'll probably be a cyber war, false flag attack on America, carried out by the deep state of America, and then blamed on Russia.
[03:48:44.969 --> 03:48:50.490]  Because, of course, Russia, or Putin in particular, is now blamed for every single thing that ever happens.
[03:48:51.110 --> 03:48:56.313]  Even if you lose your car keys or get a flat tire, pretty sure it's Putin's fault, whatever happened.
[03:48:56.313 --> 03:49:08.620]  So, get this information in advance, download the videos, store them locally, so you've got a local library of knowledge that you can turn to, because you may still have electricity, even though you don't have internet, right?
[03:49:08.620 --> 03:49:10.961]  So you can still watch those videos locally.
[03:49:10.961 --> 03:49:12.002]  That's another thing that you can do.
[03:49:12.702 --> 03:49:16.926]  The third thing is to get the skills and start growing your food.
[03:49:16.926 --> 03:49:18.328]  This is the perfect time of the year.
[03:49:18.328 --> 03:49:26.456]  This is March or coming up on mid-March, and for most of North America, this is the time to begin planting and to begin growing.
[03:49:26.456 --> 03:49:28.398]  You don't have to do it on a massive scale, folks.
[03:49:29.219 --> 03:49:36.485]  Just get the knowledge, just the practice of knowing how to grow food so you have that in your wheelhouse of skills.
[03:49:36.485 --> 03:49:48.975]  Even if you grow one tomato plant and just keep it alive and produce tomatoes, that alone is a skill set that could be life-saving as we move into this global famine and scarcity situation.
[03:49:50.274 --> 03:49:51.235]  Okay.
[03:49:51.235 --> 03:50:14.610]  Also, about storable food and nutrition, you know I'm a food scientist, and I want to mention that across the board, one reason you need to grow food is because all storable food, virtually all storable food, suffers from a lack of living plant nutrients or complex nutrients such as vitamin C. So, storable food has a very important role, which is to provide calories.
[03:50:15.430 --> 03:50:17.171]  And to provide protein and things like that.
[03:50:17.171 --> 03:50:18.591]  And it's very good at that.
[03:50:18.591 --> 03:50:20.712]  All kinds of different forms of storable food.
[03:50:20.712 --> 03:50:28.595]  But typically it lacks vitamin C. And it almost always lacks the phytonutrients such as anthocyanins.
[03:50:28.595 --> 03:50:31.196]  Now we're going to talk about anthocyanins here for a second.
[03:50:31.196 --> 03:50:35.778]  Anthocyanins are the molecules in fresh produce, fruits and vegetables.
[03:50:36.758 --> 03:50:39.479]  That give it the color pigmentation.
[03:50:39.479 --> 03:50:44.562]  So the purple on an eggplant skin, it comes from anthocyanins.
[03:50:44.562 --> 03:50:47.624]  Purple corn, that purple is from anthocyanins.
[03:50:47.624 --> 03:50:52.306]  Blackberries, blueberries, all kinds of different, even raspberries and so on.
[03:50:52.306 --> 03:50:58.689]  The pigments, especially the darker blue and purple and black pigments in food, those are anthocyanins.
[03:50:58.689 --> 03:51:00.670]  You might say, well why does that matter?
[03:51:00.670 --> 03:51:01.891]  What's the deal with anthocyanins?
[03:51:02.776 --> 03:51:06.760]  Well, anthocyanins reduce inflammation of your vascular system.
[03:51:06.760 --> 03:51:12.185]  And anthocyanins, in particular, suppress a glycoprotein known as CD38.
[03:51:12.185 --> 03:51:15.248]  And you say, well, who cares?
[03:51:15.248 --> 03:51:15.848]  What's the deal with CD38?
[03:51:17.199 --> 03:51:37.803]  Well, the hemorrhagic fever viruses that are about to be released on the world, they kill you by over-expressing CD38, causing massive inflammation of your vascular system and internal hemorrhaging and bleeding, including bleeding out of all your orifices, like your eyes and your nose and your mouth and maybe your ears.
[03:51:37.803 --> 03:51:39.244]  It's bad, okay?
[03:51:39.244 --> 03:51:40.924]  So, what I'm saying here
[03:51:42.122 --> 03:51:59.958]  is that anthocyanins, even though more research is needed, anthocyanins may be a natural way for you to suppress the overexpression of CD38 that is associated with mortality following exposure to hemorrhagic fever viruses.
[03:51:59.958 --> 03:52:03.442]  Now I can't say for sure because again more research is needed.
[03:52:03.942 --> 03:52:06.783]  But this is a feasible theory based on published science.
[03:52:06.783 --> 03:52:11.665]  We know that anthocyanins reduce the overexpression of CD38.
[03:52:11.665 --> 03:52:17.847]  So, the thing is, there's no downside to eating healthier or choosing foods of color.
[03:52:17.847 --> 03:52:18.207]  Right?
[03:52:18.207 --> 03:52:22.669]  In our society today, in the progressivism, they always talk about people of color.
[03:52:22.669 --> 03:52:24.490]  Well, what about foods of color?
[03:52:24.490 --> 03:52:26.090]  That's what we need to be eating.
[03:52:26.090 --> 03:52:30.772]  So, foods of color can save people of all colors, by the way.
[03:52:31.152 --> 03:52:36.376]  No matter who you are or your ethnicity, we have the same basic physiology.
[03:52:36.376 --> 03:52:37.977]  So we all need these molecules.
[03:52:37.977 --> 03:52:48.765]  So the next time you go to the grocery store, or the next time you decide what to grow, if you could grow red carrots or purple carrots versus just yellow carrots, go for the darker colors.
[03:52:48.765 --> 03:52:51.987]  Because what's actually happening in that case is the plant
[03:52:52.908 --> 03:53:06.430]  is synthesizing this medicinal molecule or group of molecules anthocyanins also your antioxidants and carotenoids and so on the synthesizing it from air for the most part so carbon dioxide
[03:53:07.568 --> 03:53:07.728]  I think?
[03:53:35.146 --> 03:53:38.007]  New molecules that did not exist in the seed.
[03:53:38.007 --> 03:53:40.468]  The plant is creating molecules for you.
[03:53:40.468 --> 03:53:46.711]  Another example, sprouting broccoli seeds produces a molecule known as sulforaphane.
[03:53:46.711 --> 03:53:51.994]  And yes, there's sulfur in it, as the name implies, but the rest of it is hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen.
[03:53:51.994 --> 03:53:56.936]  Sulforaphane is well documented to achieve neurological repair.
[03:53:58.072 --> 03:54:08.303]  So can you think of why we might want to have brain repair or neurological repair right now as we're living in a world where we're all under attack by spike proteins that damage your brain?
[03:54:08.303 --> 03:54:16.532]  Even spike protein shedding or exposure or someone who took the first couple of vaccines and then they decided to stop because they realized it was killing them.
[03:54:16.952 --> 03:54:20.554]  How do you repair your brain, your neurological tissue?
[03:54:20.554 --> 03:54:23.555]  Part of the answer comes down to these natural molecules.
[03:54:23.555 --> 03:54:26.897]  You can buy sprouting seeds, just broccoli seeds.
[03:54:26.897 --> 03:54:30.338]  You can sprout them in a mason jar for free.
[03:54:30.338 --> 03:54:32.259]  Just rinse it once a day.
[03:54:32.259 --> 03:54:33.380]  It'll sprout in the jar.
[03:54:33.380 --> 03:54:35.361]  It will create sulforaphane.
[03:54:35.361 --> 03:54:42.424]  And then you eat the broccoli sprouts and you are getting powerful natural medicine that's known to repair damaged neurological tissue.
[03:54:43.044 --> 03:54:55.235]  Now, this matters not only right now, but also think about in a collapse scenario, where you don't have access to neurological doctors and specialists and hospitals and all that testing and MRIs and everything else.
[03:54:55.235 --> 03:54:58.998]  You're going to need to know how to grow your own medicinal molecules.
[03:54:58.998 --> 03:55:01.500]  And that's an area where I specialize.
[03:55:01.500 --> 03:55:07.525]  I think that's why Alex asked me on today, to talk about this interaction between carbon dioxide, foods, food molecules.
[03:55:08.459 --> 03:55:08.619]  I think?
[03:55:28.806 --> 03:55:47.541]  We have the answers, we have the knowledge, and Mother Nature and God provide the molecules that we need in order to survive everything that's coming and to feed ourselves so that we can remain free citizens and don't end up standing in line in a FEMA camp somewhere begging for food handouts because you don't know how to grill your own food!
[03:55:48.496 --> 03:55:51.317]  Growing food is simple when you know how to do it.
[03:55:51.317 --> 03:55:52.658]  Growing medicine is simple.
[03:55:52.658 --> 03:55:54.338]  It happens automatically.
[03:55:54.338 --> 03:56:01.221]  You just have to know this key knowledge, the kind of knowledge I'm sharing with you right here today, and then put it to use.
[03:56:01.221 --> 03:56:02.081]  Practice this.
[03:56:02.081 --> 03:56:03.882]  This is the application of this knowledge.
[03:56:03.882 --> 03:56:04.962]  Okay.
[03:56:04.962 --> 03:56:09.104]  Now, real quick, I only have a couple minutes left.
[03:56:09.104 --> 03:56:09.824]  Oh, wow, yeah.
[03:56:09.824 --> 03:56:10.244]  Okay.
[03:56:10.244 --> 03:56:11.685]  I want to talk about crypto for a second here.
[03:56:13.096 --> 03:56:18.379]  In the past, I've been somewhat critical of some crypto speculation and hype and so on.
[03:56:18.379 --> 03:56:25.882]  The equation has completely changed now because the banks have weaponized their financial systems against you, the customer.
[03:56:25.882 --> 03:56:27.163]  Banks can no longer be trusted.
[03:56:27.163 --> 03:56:29.384]  They will steal and loot your money as Canada proved.
[03:56:29.924 --> 03:56:56.482]  Crypto now has the tipping point in my opinion widespread adoption for financial transactions for moving money even Internationally in in a fast secure way, especially with the privacy coins And I think from here forward we all need to become proficient in using crypto and moving to this parallel Financial ecosystem that is not controlled by centralized governments.
[03:56:56.482 --> 03:56:58.963]  So as of today, I just want to announce that
[03:57:00.304 --> 03:57:02.245]  Well, with some precautions.
[03:57:02.245 --> 03:57:08.907]  There are still some, you know, investment scams and so on out there, but crypto, I think, is the answer to defend ourselves.
[03:57:08.907 --> 03:57:10.427]  It's kind of like the life jacket.
[03:57:10.427 --> 03:57:13.908]  It's the survival vest for the financial ecosystem.
[03:57:13.908 --> 03:57:19.770]  Everybody needs to learn how to use crypto, and I am now using it once again for these purposes that I've described here.
[03:57:19.770 --> 03:57:21.191]  So I just want to get that on the record.

[03:58:54.913 --> 03:59:05.459]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[03:59:05.459 --> 03:59:15.124]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[03:59:15.444 --> 03:59:21.410]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[03:59:21.410 --> 03:59:26.254]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[03:59:26.254 --> 03:59:30.318]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of
