[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's
[00:11.000 --> 00:18.000]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one!
[00:18.000 --> 00:47.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47.000 --> 00:58.000]  The evidence of vaccine death and injuries is overwhelming to anyone capable of seeing past the mainstream media's hypnotic lies.
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.000]  The numbers tell us that the vaccines have already caused a 20% increase in deaths.
[01:04.000 --> 01:17.000]  Now we have a run rate of about 20% excess mortality that's confirmed by the CDC numbers, the funeral home numbers and the insurance company numbers, and then somebody did an independent study I saw recently suggesting 20% is the number.
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.000]  So we're running a 20% excess deaths.
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  And a 10% increase in disabilities.
[01:22.000 --> 01:31.000]  This is a stunning number. You're telling me that things have been flat for five years of 29 million and all of a sudden out of the data they got 3 million people are disabled out of nowhere.
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.000]  And now we are beginning to understand that this is just the beginning.
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  Things are going to get much, much worse.
[01:38.000 --> 01:49.000]  Many of us have already seen the mysterious objects found in the vials of COVID vaccines by two separate independent groups using electron microscopy.
[01:49.000 --> 02:01.000]  We are also familiar with the rising number of strokes, heart attacks and other side effects experienced worldwide after the biggest experimental vaccination in history.
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000]  And now we are getting a first glimpse of what is causing all this.
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  Something in the COVID vaccines seems to be growing within the recipient's vascular system.
[02:12.000 --> 02:19.000]  Anomalous objects are being discovered in the dead bodies of the vaccinated by embalmers and coroners.
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.000]  Horrific things being grown inside the veins and arteries.
[02:24.000 --> 02:38.000]  These are not blood clots and they appear to be some sort of organic material with small crystals and extremely thin wires made up of what looks like reptilian scales.
[02:38.000 --> 02:47.000]  This internal blockage growing within the vaccinated would certainly explain all of the deadly side effects we are seeing today.
[02:47.000 --> 02:54.000]  What the mainstream media is currently spinning as sudden adult death syndrome.
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.000]  We do not know what these things are, but they are being found by embalmers and coroners everywhere.
[03:01.000 --> 03:08.000]  Except pretty much all of them are too afraid to speak out or they don't care.
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  Only one has shown the courage to speak out so far.
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  And this is the real tragedy.
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  For those who remain silent, things will not get better.
[03:18.000 --> 03:28.000]  The FDA is poised to authorize these deadly vaccines to children as young as six months old and humanity does nothing.
[03:28.000 --> 03:34.000]  Today, we want to provide an update on a topic that I know many parents and grandparents are focused on.
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  The potential for the first COVID-19 vaccines for kids under five.
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.000]  We have waited a long time for this moment.
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  Well guys, here's some good news.
[03:45.000 --> 03:52.000]  The Biden administration has finally announced a vaccine rollout plan for children under five and they've ordered 10 million doses.
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  That's great.
[03:54.000 --> 04:00.000]  Right now, kids are like, oh my gosh, we could finally meet up for drinks.
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  Yep, as we speak, everyone in the lollipop industry is like, we're buying a yacht, here we go.
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  You get a lollipop, you get one.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  It's very exciting to hear a four-year-old scream.
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  Facebook told me Bill Gates controls the vaccines.
[04:12.000 --> 04:22.000]  Why should we deserve anything other than pain and suffering if we do nothing to protect our own children?
[04:22.000 --> 04:30.000]  Once those afraid of speaking out begin seeing their coroner tables filled with dead children, it will be too late.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  But it's not too late now.
[04:32.000 --> 04:38.000]  If you are an embalmer, a coroner, or a funeral director and you are seeing these things,
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.000]  there is still time to save the lives of our innocent children.
[04:43.000 --> 04:50.000]  You can start now by contacting Dr. Jane Ruby at protonmail.com.
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.

[05:24.000 --> 05:28.000]  The immune support, X2, D3 gummies, and multivitamin.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  The immune support formula is incredible by itself.
[05:32.000 --> 05:34.000]  These other three together, it is amazing.
[05:34.000 --> 05:35.000]  60% off.
[05:35.000 --> 05:41.000]  Then the trapezec to immune support, 50% off on immune support, X2, and D3 gummies.

[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  Now, just the X2 alone is the missing link with most people,

[05:52.000 --> 05:55.000]  beyond critical for immune system in your whole body.
[05:55.000 --> 06:17.000]  It's 40% off back in stock, but get four of the products together for 60% off.
[06:17.000 --> 06:32.000]  It's Monday, June 27th for the year, it's 2022.
[06:32.000 --> 06:33.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:33.000 --> 06:39.000]  I want to thank you all for joining us on this historic transmission.
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.000]  Russia has defaulted on its international debt,
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  fired more missiles in the Kiev.
[06:44.000 --> 06:48.000]  Ball the G7 is meeting nearby in Europe.
[06:48.000 --> 06:55.000]  Biden has cryptically said that new lockdowns are imminent,
[06:55.000 --> 07:02.000]  and we see Los Angeles and Toronto and other globalist controlled cities
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000]  announcing that they may need new lockdowns and new restrictions on gatherings
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  because of monkeypox.
[07:09.000 --> 07:15.000]  So, right on time, it's all beginning to unfold,
[07:15.000 --> 07:19.000]  and we have leaked documents out of Europe, the UK, the US,
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  and Canada as well as Australia and New Zealand,
[07:22.000 --> 07:25.000]  but they're planning new lockdowns in the fall.
[07:25.000 --> 07:27.000]  That doesn't mean they're going to do them,
[07:27.000 --> 07:29.000]  it means they're planning them and trying to get ready.
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  It doesn't protect you, destroys your immune system.
[07:32.000 --> 07:41.000]  These folks really absolutely want to lock us down forever
[07:41.000 --> 07:46.000]  and make us slaves of the great reset with carbon lockdowns
[07:46.000 --> 07:49.000]  directed by our cell phones on when we're allowed to leave our house,
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.000]  what we're allowed to do, where we're allowed to go.
[07:52.000 --> 07:55.000]  Now, I told you years ago that we're going to use cell phones for this
[07:55.000 --> 07:59.000]  because it's in the IMF and World Bank document plans,
[07:59.000 --> 08:03.000]  but now it's here, so for people to think, oh, they backed off the vaccine passports
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  and oh, they backed off the forced inoculation
[08:05.000 --> 08:09.000]  and oh, they backed off the, they didn't back off anything.
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.000]  And if you work at these hospitals or you're in the military
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.000]  or at many corporations, they make you take these shots
[08:15.000 --> 08:19.000]  and now they're talking about three quote boosters a year
[08:19.000 --> 08:22.000]  that does nothing but destroy your immune system.
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.000]  So, we're going to be getting to all of that coming up today.
[08:25.000 --> 08:30.000]  Biden once again claims another pandemic is on the way.
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  Monkeypox spreading locally at large LA County events,
[08:34.000 --> 08:37.000]  health officials say they need to stop those.
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  That's how it begins.
[08:39.000 --> 08:48.000]  Meanwhile, major new study out documenting what we already know
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  that the so-called COVID shots are gene therapies
[08:51.000 --> 08:55.000]  that cause all sorts of blood clots, cancer and destruction of your immune system
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.000]  and fertility, a lot of key news on that front.
[08:59.000 --> 09:05.000]  Obviously, we have the massive news and the fallout from the Roe v. Wade decision,
[09:05.000 --> 09:10.000]  but there's been other big, very good decisions out of the Supreme Court
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  as well that we'll be getting into.
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  I mean, this is a no-brainer.
[09:14.000 --> 09:16.000]  You don't need a Supreme Court to tell you this,
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.000]  but for 30 years across the United States,
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  in fact, right when I was leaving high school,
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.000]  30-something years ago, they were telling people,
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.000]  don't say a prayer and don't thank God
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.000]  if you're the valovictorian or the salutatorian.
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.000]  They were telling coaches, don't say prayers here in Austin
[09:37.000 --> 09:44.000]  at the beginning of a game, even in a huddle with your team.
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.000]  And then you've seen coaches that have been fined,
[09:47.000 --> 09:54.000]  coaches that have been fired in high school because they say a prayer.
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.000]  Now, that's their right to say that.
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  Separation of church and state means we don't have a state-run religion.
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  Like the Democrats do, pedophilia and Satanism,
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.000]  they're trying to bring in corporate nihilistic evil.
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  So they have their big global government religion of political correctness.
[10:11.000 --> 10:14.000]  But in America, you can be a Buddhist, you can be a Catholic,
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.000]  you can be a Christian, a Protestant, you can be an agnostic,
[10:18.000 --> 10:22.000]  you can be an atheist, you can be whatever you want.
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  And you can hand out Christmas cards at school
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.000]  and you can say a prayer at the lunch table if you want
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  and people are offended, they can move away.
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.000]  That's not state-run religion.
[10:35.000 --> 10:42.000]  The left's religion is political correctness and oppression of speech and control.
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  Their religion is tyranny.
[10:45.000 --> 10:50.000]  Their religion is enslavement.
[10:50.000 --> 10:55.000]  But now, the Supreme Court has come out and said,
[10:55.000 --> 10:59.000]  no, people can pray on the football team
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  and if somebody wants to get them to say a prayer before the game, they can do it.
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  That is up to those individuals and the people at that school
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  and that school board and those parents.
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  But because a few parents are offended by something going on,
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.000]  doesn't mean everybody else than has to keep their mouths shut,
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  call the left parades half-naked children through the streets
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.000]  with naked men all over the United States this weekend.
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.000]  We have horrible footage from across the United States
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  that we can't even show here because of obscenity laws.
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  We're showing you the milder stuff and it is horrific.
[11:35.000 --> 11:41.000]  Naked women, naked men, people urinating on each other, eating poop off the ground.
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.000]  While the Boy Scouts of America march through the middle of it
[11:46.000 --> 11:53.000]  with their rainbow flags and men naked on bikes with their penises hanging out
[11:53.000 --> 11:57.000]  right in front of three-year-old babies with their mothers holding them out
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.000]  like they've just won the Olympics.
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  They've just won a gold medal.
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  That's all coming up today, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  And remember, as shocking as the stuff is we're going to be showing you,
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.000]  it is only the milder garbage.
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.000]  So that's coming up in the last segment of this hour.
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  So a warning for those that don't want to be subjected to this,
[12:23.000 --> 12:24.000]  but we have to get it on record.
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  Because our children are the ones being forcibly subjected to this
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.000]  in true, pedophilic fashion.
[12:30.000 --> 12:38.000]  The realination, the rape of these children's minds, these children's souls
[12:38.000 --> 12:44.000]  will break it all down in the last segment of this hour.
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  We also have John Henry West in the head of Live Sight News.
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  It's tirelessly worked for the victories we're starting to have.
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.000]  He'll be joining us to lay out what he thinks is really unfolded
[12:55.000 --> 12:56.000]  and what's coming next.
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  And the next attacks the left is going to launch in their push
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.000]  to assure their access to the blood of the innocents.
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  But let me keep telling you what else is coming up here today.
[13:08.000 --> 13:14.000]  When we come back, Democrats' response to abortion ruling sounds a lot like
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  a real insurrection.
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  When they do it and do it much more intensely, it's good.
[13:21.000 --> 13:22.000]  It's wonderful.
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  And I've got CNN, MSNBC, all of them, Democrat leaders saying,
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  this is going to be a revolution.
[13:29.000 --> 13:30.000]  We're putting on the armor.
[13:30.000 --> 13:31.000]  We're going to war.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.000]  A whirlwind.
[13:32.000 --> 13:33.000]  You're going to pay.
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  And they're at the Supreme Court.
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.000]  Justice House is threatening them.
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  And the media is like, this is mostly peaceful.
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.000]  This is good.
[13:39.000 --> 13:46.000]  Taking over highways, attacking people, doing all of this with the psycho leftist
[13:46.000 --> 13:47.000]  government.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  They want access to your children, period.
[13:50.000 --> 13:56.000]  The whole thing is an act of their dominance over the life processes of humans,
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  over men and women and children.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  And remember this key point.
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  I'm going to make this again in the last segment of this hour,
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  but I'm going to do it in more detail.
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.000]  But if you take anything away from this, understand, when you see the evil in the streets
[14:10.000 --> 14:16.000]  and the naked men parading children as their captured spoils, as trophies,
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  through the streets of San Francisco, through the streets of Seattle,
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  through the streets of Dallas, through the streets of Austin,
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  through the streets of Houston, through the streets of Miami,
[14:25.000 --> 14:30.000]  through the streets of New York and Toronto and London and Berlin.
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  And all over the world this week, it's all directed by the big corporations,
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.000]  the uniforms, the outfits, the drag queen pedophile time,
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.000]  the parading of the children, the handing out of condoms to the Boy Scouts.
[14:43.000 --> 14:48.000]  All of it is directed to poison and bring down society as a weapon,
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  and it's all on record that's their plan.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  Going back to the 60s, it's in government documents,
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  and think tank documents we cover in end game, blueprint for global enslavement,
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  how this was all completely planned.
[15:01.000 --> 15:08.000]  And so that's all they're doing is parading captured children,
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  like when the Romans would parade captured slaves from countries they'd conquered,
[15:12.000 --> 15:19.000]  they are parading their children, our children, in front of us.
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  And that's what the Romans would do when they conquered an area,
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.000]  is they would come back with the spoils of thousands of captured women and children,
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.000]  they'd kill the men, celebrating the spoils of their victory,
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  pissing on the children, literally, celebrating their victory over us,
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.000]  their active dominance, their planning of the flag, and their announcement that
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  we don't just own your body, we're going to forcibly inject you,
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.000]  we're not just going to lock you in your house, but we are going to take your children.
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  If we can't kill them in the womb and do medical experiments on them,
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.000]  we're going to ruin their souls and minds after, because we serve the devil.
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.000]  Sodom and Gomorrah ain't got nothing on these people.
[15:59.000 --> 16:05.000]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones is right.
[16:05.000 --> 16:07.000]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[16:07.000 --> 16:11.000]  Well, it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew this was coming,
[16:11.000 --> 16:17.000]  I tried to stop it, and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever
[16:17.000 --> 16:23.000]  because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents.
[16:23.000 --> 16:25.000]  It's now out in the open.
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  I was upset last week that they rule the earth.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  The Bilderberg group founded Davos Group.
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[16:37.000 --> 16:38.000]  We're going to win this thing.
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.000]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth
[16:43.000 --> 16:46.000]  and your prayer and your financial support because without you,
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  Info Wars would not be here.
[16:48.000 --> 16:51.000]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the Info War
[16:51.000 --> 16:54.000]  and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  The globalists are making their move.
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  Their great reset is here.
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  They're coming for your children.
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  They're coming for the value of your currency.
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  They're coming for your national sovereignty.
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.000]  They're coming for your varied bodies with their biomedical tyranny.
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  They're coming for your free speech.
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  They're coming for your privacy.
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, they're coming for your right to vote
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  and have your representative in government
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  that you and your fellow Americans choose.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  The new film, the seminal film,
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  the most important documentary ever made in my view,

[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  They're planning to run the same scams again.

[20:00.000 --> 20:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[20:05.000 --> 20:11.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[20:11.000 --> 20:16.000]  Music
[20:16.000 --> 20:18.000]  Now listen up!
[20:18.000 --> 20:31.000]  Music
[20:31.000 --> 20:36.000]  It's Monday, June 27th.
[20:36.000 --> 20:42.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones, and coming up at the end of the hour,
[20:42.000 --> 20:45.000]  end of the next hour, we're going to go into the depths of hell.
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.000]  In fact, watching the crew review some of the footage
[20:48.000 --> 20:51.000]  and clips were getting ready reminded me of things I'd forgotten.
[20:51.000 --> 20:57.000]  We have clip after clip after clip in Louisiana and Texas,
[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  in New York, in California, and Kansas, just everywhere.
[21:02.000 --> 21:10.000]  Men coming to city councils in their mail attire and saying,
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  I'm a drag queen.
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  I dance at the local gay bar.
[21:14.000 --> 21:15.000]  That's where I work.
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.000]  I want access to your children.
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  I will groom your children.
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  I need access to them.
[21:21.000 --> 21:25.000]  And what's crazy is you see these clips from Florida and Texas,
[21:25.000 --> 21:28.000]  and the one I was mentioning was Baton Rouge.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  They all say the same thing.
[21:30.000 --> 21:34.000]  I need access to the children.
[21:34.000 --> 21:39.000]  And if you study the criminology of pedophiles,
[21:39.000 --> 21:46.000]  they are unremorseful and say they've got to have it.
[21:46.000 --> 21:52.000]  Imagine you're 18, you've got your male vigor going,
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.000]  and you just see really gorgeous women and you go ask them out
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.000]  and you want to date them because you have a huge attraction to them.
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  But if they brush you off and stuff,
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  or whatever you know not to push it,
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  because you can control your hormones,
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.000]  these are people that aren't going after folks that are of age,
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  that are adults.
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.000]  They're going after little two, three, four, five-year-old children
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  that see adults as authority figures,
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.000]  and their mothers are there saying, here, these are the good people.
[22:20.000 --> 22:23.000]  A bunch of them are convicted pedophiles and perverts
[22:23.000 --> 22:26.000]  dancing around naked in the streets,
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  doing things that we can't even show you,
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  being cheered by crowds of people,
[22:30.000 --> 22:36.000]  marching the Boy Scouts of America through the middle of it.
[22:36.000 --> 22:41.000]  I mean, folks, this is perverts on parade,
[22:41.000 --> 22:46.000]  and the whole thing is pedophilic on its face.
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  I said I'd get to it at the end of the hour,
[22:49.000 --> 22:52.000]  end of the next hour, because there's a lot of it, ladies and gentlemen,
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.000]  and the new stuff is just unbelievable.
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  But this has been going on a long time.
[22:59.000 --> 23:04.000]  But we're talking people eating feces off the ground,
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.000]  urinating in each other's mouths,
[23:06.000 --> 23:10.000]  having sex on the street.
[23:10.000 --> 23:18.000]  That footage is pouring out of Seattle and San Francisco and Europe.
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  And the media is freaking out that in Eastern Europe,
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  they're arresting people that do this.
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  You have sex in front of kids.
[23:25.000 --> 23:28.000]  You bring kids to one of these in Hungary.
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.000]  They arrest your ass, and they should.
[23:32.000 --> 23:33.000]  Think about this.
[23:33.000 --> 23:34.000]  I'm going to start getting to this right now,
[23:34.000 --> 23:35.000]  and then I'll hit abortion next segment.
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  It's all intertwined.
[23:37.000 --> 23:41.000]  Imagine if you went to the local park,
[23:41.000 --> 23:44.000]  and there was a mother and father standing there naked,
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  and they had a couple of their children with them
[23:46.000 --> 23:47.000]  who were scantily clad,
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  and the children were twerking in front of the adults.
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  You'd think, man, I'm calling the police.
[23:51.000 --> 23:57.000]  This is some kind of weird, crazy pervert deal.
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  And the police would come,
[23:59.000 --> 24:07.000]  and they would arrest them for indecent secrecy with a child.
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.000]  And if the parents were involved, CPS would come, and they should.
[24:10.000 --> 24:14.000]  But when its parents bringing their children to events
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  to have them be part of this,
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  it's praised by these jurisdictions and protected,
[24:21.000 --> 24:27.000]  and taking children to not just homosexual bars,
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.000]  taking them to bars that are sex clubs
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  where people have naked dancing,
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.000]  and they've got big signs on the walls saying,
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  it ain't going to lick itself,
[24:37.000 --> 24:41.000]  and then pornographic posters up that we can't even show you.
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  We have the footage inside the Dallas Place
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  where they were parading kids as young as three,
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.000]  putting money in men's G-strings.
[24:49.000 --> 24:54.000]  And it's unbelievably brutal stuff, folks.
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  It's a very destructive lifestyle,
[24:56.000 --> 24:59.000]  and these folks have chewed through themselves
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  and absolutely drug themselves out of their minds,
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  and the final thing, the final evil thing to do,
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  the final thing that will help them get their kicks
[25:06.000 --> 25:09.000]  is destroy your children's innocence.
[25:09.000 --> 25:18.000]  The whole thing is 100% vampiric.
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.000]  100% vampiric.
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  And I have clip after clip after clip we're going to play
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  of them saying, I need access to your children.
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  And every time they come out of the woodwork,
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  they come to the city council or the school board,
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  and they say, we're not allowed to come to the elementary school
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  on a young career day and teach your children
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  about the great careers we've got up at the local gay bar
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  where we dance. It's beautiful art.
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  We want to teach your children this art,
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.000]  and we want to groom them for the next generation.
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  These are exact quotes.
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.000]  Countless videos of men and giant dressed up like nuns
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  with clown makeup on their faces saying,
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  we are going to get your children.
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.000]  You will not stop us. We are taking them over.
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  And then the San Francisco Choir,
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.000]  the official gay choir that gets almost the same funding
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  as the main choir of the city,
[26:14.000 --> 26:17.000]  says, we're going to get your children.
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  Your children belong to us.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  We're going to groom them. We're going to take them.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  And then we're going to get you.
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  And you look at them.
[26:25.000 --> 26:31.000]  If you were trying to hire somebody to be around your children,
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.000]  you'd take one look at every one of these men,
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  and you would say those guys are perverts.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  Those guys are fruits,
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.000]  not just because they like the same sex.
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.000]  No, it's because they want access to children
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.000]  and they look like who you'd hire for a Hollywood production
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  if you were going to make a movie about a cult of pedophiles
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  that is a thousand strong,
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  that goes around kidnapping kids,
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  and you had their underground meeting,
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  it would look like these people.
[27:00.000 --> 27:03.000]  This is what it looks like. This is it.
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  Some men dressed up in clown outfits
[27:05.000 --> 27:09.000]  with their children being brought to them,
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  and many of the people we've been showing on screen
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  later get arrested
[27:14.000 --> 27:19.000]  because they already have prior convictions
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  for assaulting children.
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  And yeah, the local newscast in Houston
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.000]  were like, well, got to get them while they're young.
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.000]  And then Desmond is amazing.
[27:31.000 --> 27:36.000]  They parade him around with convicted chainsaw murderers.
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.000]  One guy killed his boyfriend with a chainsaw.
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  He's a famous, he's dead now, advocate for pedophilia.
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.000]  He himself was a club boy when he was like 12 and 13 in the gay bars.
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  Yeah, there he is right there.
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  He died of a drug overdose last year,
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  and they've got Desmond is amazing,
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  this little boy being paraded around
[27:57.000 --> 28:05.000]  talking about sex and taking ketamine with these guys.
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.000]  And they get up to kindergartners
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  and say, let me show you how to shake your ass.
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.000]  And that's at the library. That's on the Associated Press.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  That's them saying it's a good thing.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  And people were asking me 10 years ago,
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  Jones, why are you so upset about this?
[28:21.000 --> 28:25.000]  I said, folks, this is the globalist takeover arm.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  If you can have a big disgusting fat man
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.000]  in a clown outfit that's obviously scary as hell
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  and make kids go sit in their lap
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  and the kids always look scared
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  and the mothers make them go sit in their lap,
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.000]  it's a big, giant, evil, sick exercise of dominance and control
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  of bondage.
[28:43.000 --> 28:46.000]  This is children being put into sexual bondage
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  and their innocence being destroyed
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  and it is a curse on our nation if it's allowed to continue.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  The devil knows exactly what he's doing.
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  This is an affront to God.
[28:55.000 --> 29:24.000]  If it doesn't continue, we'll be destroyed.
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  Thank you so much for watching.
[29:55.000 --> 30:06.000]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all.
[30:06.000 --> 30:10.000]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[30:10.000 --> 30:15.000]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare
[30:15.000 --> 30:18.000]  and that alone is something to be grateful for.
[30:18.000 --> 30:22.000]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water
[30:22.000 --> 30:25.000]  even in the event of your taps getting shut off
[30:25.000 --> 30:31.000]  and having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.

[32:27.000 --> 32:30.000]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[32:30.000 --> 32:32.000]  No, you've never seen that have you?
[32:32.000 --> 32:42.000]  And this little jewel right here is solid liquid consciousness.
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.000]  Look it up.
[32:44.000 --> 32:50.000]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[32:50.000 --> 32:55.000]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil
[32:55.000 --> 33:00.000]  just like our information is dynamite so are our products in forestore.com.
[33:00.000 --> 33:29.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:30.000 --> 33:41.000]  Well, if you believe the BBC and ABC News, which they lie so much it's hardly anything they say,
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  but it might have happened.
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.000]  We'll try to talk to independent reporters over there.
[33:46.000 --> 33:51.000]  Putin just fired missiles at a shopping mall in Kiev blowing it to bits.
[33:51.000 --> 33:56.000]  It's a giant smoking crater still on fire.
[33:56.000 --> 34:01.000]  That's a little message in the G7 that's meeting nearby.
[34:01.000 --> 34:05.000]  We'll be getting into all of that coming up in the third hour today.
[34:05.000 --> 34:15.000]  Speaking of the economy, Democrat response to abortion ruling sounds a lot like a call for insurrection.
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.000]  We're seeing violence and attacks all over the country.
[34:18.000 --> 34:28.000]  I have clips here of MSNBC, NBC, you name it, saying that this is going to spark a civil war in America
[34:28.000 --> 34:34.000]  and that there's violence in the ruling, that Republicans are violent by not letting people kill babies.
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  Talk about upside down world.
[34:36.000 --> 34:37.000]  Talk about doublespeak.
[34:37.000 --> 34:38.000]  We've got a big compilation.
[34:38.000 --> 34:45.000]  It's up on infowars.com of Democrat leaders saying, oh, we want to kill babies up until the time they're born,
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.000]  maybe even after they're born.
[34:47.000 --> 34:51.000]  So there's just no end to how they keep pushing the envelope.
[34:51.000 --> 34:58.000]  Alexandria Cortez AOC calls for Supreme Court justices to be impeached.
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.000]  And it just goes on from there.
[35:00.000 --> 35:06.000]  We're going to be laying out the latest abortion news and how that ties into Biden,
[35:06.000 --> 35:16.000]  who the Democrats think can run on Roe v. Wade being overturned and misrepresenting what that really does.
[35:16.000 --> 35:25.000]  Instead of the facts that they have accelerated inflation and the collapse of our borders and the devaluation of the currency.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  And here are those headlines.
[35:27.000 --> 35:36.000]  As gas prices surge, stations now hold up to 175 of your money when you swipe.
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  Wall Street Journal.
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  Why are they doing that?
[35:42.000 --> 35:48.000]  When drivers insert a credit card, debit card at the pump, the gas station doesn't know how much fuel they will buy,
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.000]  and it places a hold on the account for an amount set by the gas station.
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.000]  And they're letting it max out at $175.
[35:56.000 --> 36:02.000]  Some pumps only let you get $100, which won't even fill up most average tanks.
[36:02.000 --> 36:03.000]  But that's okay.
[36:03.000 --> 36:06.000]  It doesn't matter that gas prices have had all-time records.
[36:06.000 --> 36:16.000]  Biden administration is planning a propaganda blitz to tell how he's delivering for the middle class and how great things are.
[36:16.000 --> 36:20.000]  That story is up on infowords.com.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  There's all these questions being asked.
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.000]  Did corporate greed fuel inflation?
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  It's not the biggest culprit.
[36:28.000 --> 36:33.000]  Well, it's corporate greed wanting government contracts and other things.
[36:33.000 --> 36:38.000]  Lobbying for more quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve.
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  And so, yes, corporations run the world.
[36:40.000 --> 36:48.000]  They set the policy, the Fortune 100, that control the Fortune 500, that controls the Fortune 5000.
[36:48.000 --> 36:54.000]  And they deliberately created monetary policy that they knew would do exactly what they're doing.
[36:54.000 --> 37:01.000]  Destroy the middle class, destroy the currency, but transfer all the power in the process on the ride up to themselves.
[37:01.000 --> 37:07.000]  And now they're in charge on top of us on the ride down.
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  Russia defaults on foreign debt for the first time since 1918.
[37:11.000 --> 37:16.000]  Bloomberg reports Russia defaults on its foreign currency sovereign debt for the first time in a century.
[37:16.000 --> 37:22.000]  The culmination of ever-tuffeting Western sanctions, the shutdown payment, routes to overseas creditors.
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  That'll certainly not just hurt Russia, but hurt the world economy.
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  We'll have more on that coming up.
[37:28.000 --> 37:37.000]  But I wanted to speak to the fact that Russia actually is now the biggest oil exporter in the world,
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.000]  passing up Saudi Arabia, who passed up the U.S. in the last year and a half under Biden.
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  And many areas of the Russian economy are doing better than they were previously doing,
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  while the Europe's economy and the U.S. economy is falling apart.
[37:50.000 --> 37:55.000]  You know the globalists know that, and they're making money on both sides.
[37:55.000 --> 38:00.000]  Now, let's continue here, because I want to play several clips here,
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.000]  discussing the Democrats breaking into the Arizona capital, Democrats blocking highways,
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  Democrats saying we're in a civil war, Democrats saying get your armor on,
[38:09.000 --> 38:15.000]  saying get in the streets, you know, go out and intimidate people at their houses.
[38:15.000 --> 38:23.000]  But then if Republicans do one-tenth of that, we are Satan and must all be arrested and must see all put in jail,
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  and not even the people that do stuff like that should be put in jail,
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.000]  but people that are just around or even trying to stop it need to be put in jail.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  I'll, uh, January 6th.
[38:33.000 --> 38:42.000]  So here's several clips of NBC's reporters and others saying we're going into a civil war.
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  Here's some of the rhetoric.
[38:44.000 --> 38:51.000]  You know, here's a case where the Supreme Court is doing a decision that is going to fly in the face of,
[38:51.000 --> 38:57.000]  at least what polls tell us is a majority of Americans, maybe 60 to 70%.
[38:57.000 --> 39:04.000]  And if you look at human history and American history, that tends to push a society into civil war,
[39:04.000 --> 39:10.000]  or at least toward civil war, if it's something that's as basic as this.
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.000]  I'm not saying this is the same as the Dred Scott decision in 1857,
[39:15.000 --> 39:22.000]  but basically that was a decision that said anyone who hopes for an end to slavery and for black people in America
[39:22.000 --> 39:27.000]  to be full of first-class citizens can give up hope.
[39:27.000 --> 39:30.000]  That did a lot to accelerate our civil war.
[39:30.000 --> 39:36.000]  I'm worried that when you have a Supreme Court making a decision like this and doing it in language
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.000]  that's almost provocative and angry and vengeful, it could have that effect.
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.000]  I love our country. Part of our country is unity. I think that's jeopardized.
[39:46.000 --> 39:51.000]  There is a war out there and we need to recognize that we've got to armor up.
[39:51.000 --> 39:54.000]  That's right. This is not a drill.
[39:54.000 --> 40:15.000]  We're in trouble, folks. The trans creature has cut some of his hair.
[40:15.000 --> 40:25.000]  It's over. The she-maiden folks, ready to lark, ready to play Dungeons & Dragons in the local park.
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.000]  Oh, and they're going to talk to your kids. If you don't like it, well...
[40:29.000 --> 40:38.000]  Here's the Antifa burning the Gadsden flag, other flags up front, the Supreme Court.
[40:38.000 --> 40:49.000]  Again, here's another one of the deadly warriors. They're flame torches. They're coming to get you, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.000]  Really, they just want access to your children.
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.000]  We've got a compilation of that coming up next segment.
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.000]  In fact, we're going to go to break and come back and really dig into this and tie it together with abortion,
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.000]  with the trans movement, wanting to sterilize children.
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  All of it's about destroying life, sterilizing people, killing people.
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.000]  I'm going to lay it out coming out next segment.
[41:11.000 --> 41:19.000]  But first, in this world of destabilization and devaluation and inflation,
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  the smartest move is to get high-quality, storable food from a trusted source.
[41:23.000 --> 41:30.000]  We have high-quality, storable food, amazing quality, taste delicious, very nutritious.

[45:06.000 --> 45:12.000]  And one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the sensors has been Patriot Apparel,
[45:12.000 --> 45:18.000]  so we can identify each other, so we can spread the word, and so we can push people to websites like Infowars.com,
[45:18.000 --> 45:21.000]  so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[45:21.000 --> 45:25.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts,
[45:25.000 --> 45:29.000]  some of which go back more than 25 years. All these shirts are limited edition.
[45:29.000 --> 45:34.000]  They are about to be history, and will only exist in your closet, your drawer, or your wardrobe.
[45:34.000 --> 45:37.000]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left.
[45:37.000 --> 45:40.000]  In a couple weeks, they'll all be gone and they'll be history.
[45:40.000 --> 45:45.000]  We're selling them all at cost at InfowarsStore.com.
[45:45.000 --> 45:51.000]  So, thank you all for your support. Please visit InfowarsStore.com and get one of these historic shirts,

[45:59.000 --> 46:06.000]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all.
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[46:10.000 --> 46:17.000]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare, and that alone is something to be grateful for.
[46:17.000 --> 46:25.000]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut off.
[46:25.000 --> 46:30.000]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[46:30.000 --> 46:37.000]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[46:37.000 --> 46:42.000]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming,
[46:42.000 --> 46:48.000]  but you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.

[47:41.000 --> 47:46.000]  Your children will work to convert all their sisters and brothers.
[47:46.000 --> 47:57.000]  Then soon they're almost certain your kids will start converting you.
[47:57.000 --> 48:07.000]  The gay agenda is coming home. The gay agenda is here.
[48:07.000 --> 48:12.000]  But you don't have to worry because there's nothing wrong with standing by our side.
[48:12.000 --> 48:24.000]  Get on board and get on board with us.
[48:24.000 --> 48:28.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have hours and hours and hours of this.
[48:28.000 --> 48:32.000]  This is the Democratic Party culture.
[48:32.000 --> 48:37.000]  I was in New York last year to go on Andrew Schultz's podcast
[48:37.000 --> 48:42.000]  and to go on Michael Malice's podcast.
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.000]  I was there four days and it was Gay Pride Month.
[48:46.000 --> 48:49.000]  It was this time last year. It was just flags everywhere.
[48:49.000 --> 48:58.000]  The churches, the people, men running around in dresses and children being indoctrinated into a sex cult.
[48:58.000 --> 49:03.000]  It's about the sex and the future of the children so that they'll have their innocence destroyed
[49:03.000 --> 49:09.000]  and will be forced into this with groups saying, we're coming for your children, you won't stop us.
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  They're doing it in the private schools. They're doing it in the public schools.
[49:12.000 --> 49:18.000]  There is a very big, large Christian school in Austin that's Episcopal.
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.000]  I know a lot of people that go there and a lot of people are pulling their children out
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.000]  because I have four children and two of them are still in school.
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.000]  They don't go there but they have friends that go there.
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  My daughter is now going to kindergarten. She's just turned five.
[49:34.000 --> 49:39.000]  We were just talking to some of the parents about whether we're going to home school or a small school
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.000]  and they said, we're having to pull our six-year-old daughter out
[49:43.000 --> 49:50.000]  because she came home from the biggest private school in Austin that used to be right wing years ago
[49:50.000 --> 49:57.000]  and said, boys can be girls. Girls can be boys.
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  You can pick your gender but you can have two daddies, two mommies.
[50:01.000 --> 50:07.000]  I mean, what the hell is a six-year-old being taught that at a Christian school?
[50:07.000 --> 50:16.000]  It's taken over people and it's going to make you be part of it just like in the biblical tale of Sodom and Gomorrah
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  where they come to your door and they say, come out in the street with us.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  We're going to have sex with you in the street.
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.000]  If you live here, we have sex with you.
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  It's an act of dominance. It's rape.
[50:27.000 --> 50:33.000]  I mean, the left has Gillette commercials and other corporate ads out saying if a guy tells a girl she's good looking
[50:33.000 --> 50:38.000]  or asks a girl out, that's harassment and wrong and all sex is rape between a man and a woman.
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  That's what they teach.
[50:40.000 --> 50:45.000]  But if it's a man teaching a five-year-old how to give a blow job, well, then it's a wonderful thing.
[50:45.000 --> 50:54.000]  Or if it's a three-year-old seeing naked men dance around and cut themselves in the streets of Seattle or Dallas,
[50:54.000 --> 50:58.000]  well, then it's a good thing.
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  Imagine.
[51:00.000 --> 51:07.000]  I mean, you hear about some of these Mormon break-off group in Texas where he had like 10 wives
[51:07.000 --> 51:13.000]  and some of them were like 16 years old and he's in prison.
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.000]  For rape.
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  Okay, put them in prison.
[51:18.000 --> 51:26.000]  These people are literally coming to your school and taking children to these sex bars
[51:26.000 --> 51:30.000]  and planning their flag of control over them and saying we're here to recruit them.
[51:30.000 --> 51:36.000]  We're here to take them over and they've got full Disney, full Hollywood, full Democratic Party backing
[51:36.000 --> 51:40.000]  with the Democratic Party litmus test at the Democrat debates.
[51:40.000 --> 51:45.000]  Do you believe that men deserve access to abortion rights so they can have their babies?
[51:45.000 --> 51:50.000]  Yes, we've got to get men access to abortions.
[51:50.000 --> 51:56.000]  It's mind control, ladies and gentlemen.
[51:56.000 --> 52:00.000]  It's mind control.
[52:00.000 --> 52:08.000]  They have ads running everywhere, not just Gillette, saying a man talking to a woman is wrong and evil.
[52:08.000 --> 52:15.000]  But if you're going to teach a five-year-old to sit on a convicted pedophile's lap while he rubs his genitals on them,
[52:15.000 --> 52:18.000]  I mean, we got stuff we can't even show you, folks.
[52:18.000 --> 52:25.000]  We shot in Austin four years ago that Millie Weaver shot.
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  She did a great job.
[52:27.000 --> 52:36.000]  She went to one of their confabs at a big hotel in a conference room and they had men totally naked with glitter on their penises
[52:36.000 --> 52:40.000]  with three and four or five-year-old kids sitting in their lap.
[52:40.000 --> 52:47.000]  We've shown a little bit of it, but not the kids actually sitting on the genitals because that's child porn.
[52:47.000 --> 52:53.000]  They were in there producing child porn, in my view.
[52:53.000 --> 52:59.000]  We can't even show it to you because I will not distribute it.
[52:59.000 --> 53:05.000]  As journalists, we went there and it was criminal.
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.000]  We just have little kids taking their clothes off, folks.
[53:08.000 --> 53:11.000]  What we're showing you is what can be put out on air.
[53:11.000 --> 53:14.000]  And by the way, we called for criminal investigations of this.
[53:14.000 --> 53:15.000]  We called the police department.
[53:15.000 --> 53:21.000]  They're not going to do anything because the DA is a communist on record.
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  Here's a compilation from just a few years ago.
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.000]  We're having to make new ones because there's so much horrible new stuff.
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  But here they are declaring your children belong to us.
[53:28.000 --> 53:29.000]  We're coming for them.
[53:29.000 --> 53:30.000]  It's all pedophilic.
[53:30.000 --> 53:37.000]  And then remember, the abortions to kill them and the trans stuff is to confuse kids, have the state take them, and then sterilize them as well.
[53:37.000 --> 53:38.000]  They don't want to just rape them.
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  They want to cut their testicles off.
[53:40.000 --> 53:41.000]  Here's the report.
[53:41.000 --> 53:48.000]  The Heights Public Library today debuting a new children's story hour called Drag Queen Story Time.
[53:48.000 --> 53:49.000]  My name is Blackberry.
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  I'm a bearded drag queen.
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  That means I'm a lady with lots of facial hair.
[53:53.000 --> 53:57.000]  I'm actually going to be one of the drag queens reading for Drag Queen Story Time.
[53:57.000 --> 53:58.000]  Drag Queen Story Time.
[53:58.000 --> 54:05.000]  And we have to warn you ladies and gentlemen, if you've got young or impressionable children in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[54:07.000 --> 54:12.000]  And we witnessed parents taking their children as young as two inside to take part.
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  Talking, singing, and reading.
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  We can both be grooms.
[54:16.000 --> 54:20.000]  To an audience of preschoolers, toddlers, and their caregivers.
[54:20.000 --> 54:24.000]  The hips on the drag queen go swish, swish, swish.
[54:24.000 --> 54:28.000]  Turn around and shake your butt. Shake them, shake them, shake them, shake them.
[54:28.000 --> 54:32.000]  It was a first for this branch of the public library too.
[54:32.000 --> 54:33.000]  Are you nervous?
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.000]  Yes.
[54:34.000 --> 54:35.000]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[54:35.000 --> 54:36.000]  No.
[54:36.000 --> 54:42.000]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[54:42.000 --> 54:47.000]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable than seeing it.
[54:47.000 --> 54:55.000]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone. No one's there to persuade people or to recruit people.
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.000]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up?
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  You could be a drag queen superhero.
[55:00.000 --> 55:01.000]  Are you nervous?
[55:01.000 --> 55:02.000]  Yes.
[55:04.000 --> 55:10.000]  They were all accepting. They all were happy about it and excited and giving me hugs and everything.
[55:10.000 --> 55:15.000]  The woman gets up on her table, spreads her legs. It's a man. This is adult entertainment.
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.000]  Most people seem to walk away having a good time.
[55:18.000 --> 55:19.000]  I start them young, right?
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  I start them young, right?
[55:21.000 --> 55:25.000]  Anyone can do drag. Everyone can do drag.
[55:29.000 --> 55:33.000]  I'm all about education. I actually do Storytime with Drag Queens in Chicago.
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  Right?
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  Yes. Family programming.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  Love it. Yes.
[55:40.000 --> 55:49.000]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at a Houston public library as part of its drag queen story hour.
[55:49.000 --> 55:58.000]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those drag queens, Tatiana Malanina, is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[55:58.000 --> 56:02.000]  In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an eight-year-old boy.
[56:02.000 --> 56:05.000]  This is Tatiana Malanina, my sister from Queens of the Week.
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  What has this world come to? It's come to a world where drag kids actually exist.
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  And people do ketamine on a couch.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  Desmond is the world's youngest club kid.
[56:15.000 --> 56:20.000]  And we challenge you, as the people out there, to find a younger club kid. Will they find one? No.
[56:20.000 --> 56:25.000]  Please welcome Desmond Naples, a.k.a. Desmond is amazing!
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  Yeah, have you been to a night club?
[56:29.000 --> 56:30.000]  No.
[56:30.000 --> 56:31.000]  No? Okay.
[56:31.000 --> 56:42.000]  Drag should be an all-agent thing, and some people consider it provocative. It's not inappropriate.
[56:42.000 --> 56:46.000]  This used to be a fun show.
[56:57.000 --> 57:00.000]  Teach the children. Teach the children.
[57:00.000 --> 57:12.000]  I'm all about education.
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.000]  And everywhere else, it's called pedophilia.
[57:15.000 --> 57:22.000]  But when it's done institutionally, and they can get away with people dressed up like demon clowns with your children,
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.000]  pull up tranny time in the New York schools.
[57:25.000 --> 57:31.000]  This is put out in New York Times, like it's wonderful. And it's the biggest scary-looking group of weirdo pot-bellied men.
[57:31.000 --> 57:36.000]  Looks like a bunch of Dennis Hasterds running around with clown makeup on,
[57:36.000 --> 57:40.000]  just hopping around, rubbing their giant bellies in front of children.
[57:40.000 --> 57:45.000]  And you're like, what alternate universe is this? What planet did I wake up in?
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  We'll be back. Stay with us.
[57:49.000 --> 57:55.000]  There's an old Bedouin saying that's thousands of years old, and it goes like this.
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.000]  Trust in God, but tie up your camel.
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  Hunter S. Thompson put it this way.
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  Pray to God, but row away from the rocks.
[58:02.000 --> 58:07.000]  If your boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God that you don't get smashed on him and killed,
[58:07.000 --> 58:10.000]  but also try to row away. You can't just sit there like a jellyfish.
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  And it's the same thing with our immune system.
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  God helps those who help themselves.
[58:14.000 --> 58:19.000]  We have a lot of amazing products on sale right now at infowarsstore.com.
[58:19.000 --> 58:25.000]  Like the Ultimate Immune Support Pack, our four best-selling products together at 60% off.

[58:41.000 --> 58:44.000]  So the Ultimate Sale will probably be over in just a few days.

[58:46.000 --> 58:49.000]  and protect yourself and your family at infowarsstore.com.
[58:55.000 --> 58:57.000]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[58:57.000 --> 58:59.000]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing. It is.
[58:59.000 --> 59:04.000]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[59:04.000 --> 59:07.000]  The fish oil is better than that, and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[59:07.000 --> 59:12.000]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[59:12.000 --> 59:16.000]  Crill oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm just sorry.
[59:16.000 --> 59:18.000]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  The Crill is hallucinogenic. It's so good.
[59:20.000 --> 59:23.000]  It ain't my view. I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[59:23.000 --> 59:26.000]  I eat five caplets of Crill oil before I go to bed.
[59:26.000 --> 59:29.000]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[59:29.000 --> 59:35.000]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[59:35.000 --> 59:40.000]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess,
[59:40.000 --> 59:43.000]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[59:43.000 --> 59:44.000]  I just can't do it.
[59:44.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  I just can't do it.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  All right, we're going deep down the rabbit hole on this Roe v. Lane decision.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  Some of the other big decisions that just happened that are very good,
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  the Second Amendment, and the right of free speech.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  Not just the right of children to not be in their mother's wombs,
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  and the pushback with the left with one of the top experts,
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  the founder and head of Lifesight News, to be joining us.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  But I wanted to go to another one of these compilations we've done.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  Probably 20 of them.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  We just played one about four years ago.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  Here's one from about a year ago, or less, that Rob do put together.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  And then we've got a new compilation,
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  bottom of the hour, of the stuff happening at the pedophile parades.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  That's what they are.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  They're not gay parades.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  They're pedophile parades.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  And so we're going to show that.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  These are celebrations of their war against innocent,
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  and this cult saying they're taking over our children and our lives.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  So that compilation is being put together from what happened over the weekend.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  It's coming up at the bottom of the hour, but first, here's this report.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  We're going to have a great night tonight.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  And for you people in Florida, we're going to have a gay night.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  Gay.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  Gay.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  Gay.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  Gay.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  Gay.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  Gay.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  Gay.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  Gay.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  Gay.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  Gay.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  Gay.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  Gay.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  Gay.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  Gay.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  Gay.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  Gay.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  Gay.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  Gay.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  Gay.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  Gay.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  Gay.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  Gay.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  This is the most cringed thing I've ever seen,
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  fully psycho members.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  And literally obsessed with sex.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  That's what a part of it is.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  I mean, these people are just crazy.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  And they want access to your children.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  They got access to them.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  We said sex, we said sex, we said sex, we said sex, we said sex, we said sex, we said sex, we said sex, we said sex, we said sex.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  You think we're sinful?
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  You fight against our rights?
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  You say we all lead lives?
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  You can't respect?
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  We'll convert your children.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  Someone's got to teach them not to hate.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  We're coming, we are dreaming.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  It turns out a bunch of these people were convicted child rapists, of course.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  In the San Francisco gay choir.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Fun of gay choir.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  It's a child rape organization, in my view.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  Child rape of their minds and their innocence.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  That's Austin right there.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  Men naked, posing with children.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  And at the degeneration rate of this, they'll be raping children in the town square within one year.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  I'm excited, and giving me hugs and everything.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  I start them young, right?
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  Everyone can do that.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  Everyone can do that.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  But you don't have to worry.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  Because there's nothing wrong with standing by our side.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  Get on board and get ready.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  Drake should be at all ages.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  They can tell people that they're not provocative.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  Get on board and get ready.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  Because there's nothing wrong with standing by our side.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  Get on board and get ready.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  Because the world always needs help.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  There's no crime.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  Come on, try a little crime.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  We'll convert your children.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  Then we'll turn to you.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  Giving off the tear inside your screen like you never knew.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  Go and see San Francisco.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  Go and turn up that disco.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  You'll forget you were ever upset.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  We'll convert your children.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  And make an ally of you again.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  These are people that fell to Satan.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  These are soulless zombies now.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  That only reflect they're alive when they're destroying innocents.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  We should be very sad.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  We lost these people.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  And we should not make fun of them.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  We should stand against them and protect our children from them.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  I'm pushing an overly sexualized agenda.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  Are you nervous?
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Yes.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  No.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  And for the children and the people that support it,
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  are going to realize that this is going to be
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  the grooming of the next generation.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  Yep.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  They go to city councils and they say we're grooming your children.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  They're ours.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  We're going to convince them to have their genitals cut off.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  We can't abort them.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  We'll cut their genitals off later.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  and your prayer and your financial support.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  Because without you, info wars would not be here.
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  And you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour number two on this live Monday,
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  June 27th broadcast.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  We have a true warrior and a champion of the fight for the unborn
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  and now the born, they're wanting to kill babies.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  After they're born, a champion for life against euthanasia,
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  against all of it, is John Henry Weston.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  And he of course heads up the great organization LifeSite News.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  He's been on with us many times and I've been reading his website
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  for more than a decade and covering the incredible information
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  that they lay out at LifeSiteNews.com.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  And we couldn't get a better person on today to talk about this historic ruling
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  last week and the responses to it and what the next phase of the battle
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  is going to be both by those drunk on the blood of the innocents
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  and those of us whose hearts are convicted trying to stop it.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  The Democrats are now threatening civil war.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  They're now saying they're going to hand out morning after pills everywhere
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  out of vending machines.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  That's going to be the new fight, very toxic, very dangerous pills
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  that they can kill women.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  We've got all of this and more to discuss with him.
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  And then it's all interconnected, the pedophile parades nationwide,
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  parading children through the streets with naked men, eating feces,
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  urinating on each other.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  Folks, we can't show you this on TV.
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  We're on a lot of TV stations and cable stations.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  We can't show you this, but children are being subjected to it.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  So the stuff we showed you, if you think it was bad earlier in the last hour
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  is nothing.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  I literally have had nightmares in the last three days
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  over having to review this stuff because it's one thing to see these
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  sick pedophile pervert freaks dancing around,
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  but little kids looking very upset, very threatened with their parents
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  shoving them into the arms of MOLOC to have their innocence destroyed.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  It's just unbelievable.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  This is true mass demonic possession of my view, but I'm ranting.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  I appreciate John Henry Weston, the head of LifeSiteNews,
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  LifeSiteNews.com joining us, a real world expert on this.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  It's got to be satisfying after your decades and decades of this long fight,
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  beating one of the leading, if not the leading pro life site in the world
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  to see so much success happening.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  And so thank you for joining us.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  Congratulations.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  Good to be with you.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  Where do you want to start?
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  Well, first of all, praise the God.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  What an incredible thing.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  And who would have thought?
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  I think realists like you are would have said, I don't know,
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  even though, yes, we made some good appointments,
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  but then there've been betrayals among the Supreme Court justices.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  But Trump gave us what we needed to get over the hump in terms of the Supreme Court.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  But it was still incredible.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  When the leak came in May and the left went insane,
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  there was a lot still on the table.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  We knew that should one of the justices be killed,
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  which was a very real possibility,
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  that the leaked ruling or the draft ruling wouldn't stand.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  And that's why we had an attempt on the life of Justice Kavanaugh.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  And it's incredible because truly what I think happened was the prayer
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  that went into defending the lives of the justices
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  and the prayer that has gone into ending Roe v. Wade for 50 years has come true.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  So that our Lord is able to now,
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  you're going to see a very divided United States.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  You're going to have some states where the blood will continue to be shed,
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  where the blood of the innocent, which cries to heaven or vengeance,
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  as the scriptures say, will continue to flow.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  But in certain states, ten right off the bat,
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  but another ten that are going to come online very soon,
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  the protection of life of the innocent in their mother's womb
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  is now protected by law the way it should be.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  All of a sudden, at least this basic element of civilization has been restored
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  to a good part of the United States of America.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  So that God's blessing can once again flow,
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  but it's a divided America.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  You have all these other states,
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  which want to call themselves a sanctuary for abortion,
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  where they're saying, please come, let us kill your children.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  They put it, of course, in their own terminology,
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  but that's exactly what it is.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  So it's a divided America.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  And what the ruling does is it brings the battle to the states.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  No longer can the federal government force abortion on unwilling states
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  so that in Alabama and other places where they want the legislature
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  was voted in to protect life,
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  no longer can the federal's just say, hey, you got to do it anyway.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  Most of your people, the vast majority of your people want to protect life,
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  tough luck, we're going to kill your babies anyhow.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  We're going to legalize it.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  No, no more.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  Now the states get to decide for themselves.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  So the battle is there.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  Now at the state level, there's a lot of work to be done.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  And the work to be done is not only at the legislative level,
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  but it's also obviously working to change minds and hearts to support women
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  who find themselves in troubled pregnancies and unexpected pregnancies
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  to educate people on abstinence and on the reality of marriage and everything else
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  that leads to life and this great gift of sexuality, which is meant for procreation
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  and to bring it all back to normalcy.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  We need to get there.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  There's a lot of work to be done, but an amazing first step because while some people say,
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  oh, it does nothing, it does nothing, actually it does something
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  because the law in addition to what it is on its face in terms of protection
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  and police powers is also a teacher.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  So the very fact that laws are now on the books in many states that protect life
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  from conception will teach people that once again the value of life is real
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  and it should be protected, should be protected in law.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  I'm not a theologian like you and many of your crew are.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  I know you're just immersed in it, but I remember Sunday school and reading the Bible
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  and it just seems like common sense to me that God wanted governments to have righteous rules
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  and God would hold it against the population, even if a lot of the population was good,
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  if the government was carrying out evil and then if the people didn't oppose it,
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  they would then basically not receive the blessings of God anymore.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  And that's how I see this. It divides the wheat from the shaft, the goats from the sheep.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  It'll bring the evil of these people out in the open and how horrible they act
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  and the simulation of killing children and them admitting it's about killing babies
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  and really the operating system of the Democrats is now overtly Satanistic
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  and getting more intense and so that bringing out this evil will then further convict other people's hearts
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  to really wake up and understand this is a battle between good and evil.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  I do see this as a gigantic victory, as you were saying, moving us really fast in the right direction
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  and Trump was far from perfect, but his grand amazing victory, his supreme legacy,
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  regardless of what happens to Trump in the future, is that he said he would do this in that debate
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  six years ago with Hillary and he deliberate on it and it happened
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  and that makes Trump amazing and a blessing and an incredible man.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  You judge a tree by its fruits, no way Trump's bad doing something like that.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  Well, absolutely so. What an incredible gift if he did absolutely nothing else
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  that would have been worth it in spades because the number of American children's lives
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  he's saved by those appointments will only be seen in the future
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  and it will redound to his own blessing.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  There's a lot that Trump has to answer for, but you know what?
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  This is going to work in his favor when he has to meet his maker.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  In terms of what you were talking about, it's very interesting.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  Yes, the bombing and firebombing of churches and vandalism and threats
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  and all of the hell that we're seeing break out because the demon has had a defeat
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  and now he's flailing and as you put it in his minions, these are people who are lost
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  that are given to Satan, the anger, the violence that is coming out of them right now.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  Hopefully they'll look in the mirror and be able to see it for what it is
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  and turn around, but the one effect that you mentioned that is so powerful
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  is that others will get to see.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  Eyes will be opened.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  In a way, I think that right now it's not.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  People can see in the destruction of churches, in the vandalism, the firebombing,
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  the threats to people's lives, the willingness to even commit murder.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  People will say, wait a minute, I thought this was a movement about choice
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  and honoring women and these fetuses weren't children really,
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  but all of a sudden it's becoming clear Satan is letting his guard down
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  in order to whip up a frenzy.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  That's right, stay right there, John Henry, you've got to come right back
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  and this is incredibly important information.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 30 months we've witnessed the globalists hit humanity
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  and hit humanity extremely hard.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  It is beyond critical that everyone listening to the sound of my voice
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  protect yourselves and your families to the greatest extent possible

[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  You get the big secret, you ever seen fish oil look like that?
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  No, you never seen that have you?
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  And this little jewel right here is solid liquid consciousness.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  Look it up, find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  just like our information is dynamite so are our products in forestore.com
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  We have literally hours and hours of Democrats right here in Austin this weekend saying I love Satan, I want to kill children.
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  And you think okay, they're just trying to freak you out.
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  But we've infiltrated their meetings, we've played the undercover videos, Project Veritas has as well.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  They have really adopted Satanism and a few years ago that Satanic Temple put out that movie,
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  it's called Hail Satan.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  I went to Salt and My Wife and the audience at Alamo Draft House was full of people laughing at the Christians,
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  cheering the Satanists and saying Hail Satan, like they think it's cute and funny,
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  but it's not a joke, they're actually taking it up.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  It's like a child pretending to be a police officer or a fireman and they become one later.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  And there's national articles about the fastest growing religion among Democrats and leftist is Satanism.
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  Look it up.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  And the Satanic churches admit it's a sacrament of sacrifice.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  We always told you that.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  This is deadly serious and it's backed by the big corporations and by Disney and others.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  And this whole agenda of dehumanizing is run by the God of this world, the following.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  We're going to talk to one of the leading figures battling this evil, how historic this is in a moment.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  But here's just two clips.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  One from Saturday with our reporters Savannah Hernandez drew Hernandez out front the Supreme Court.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  Just one clip of hundreds we got.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  This was part of the course.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  And then a clip from a few years ago of an abortion doctor sounding exactly the same with the,
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  I hate the children.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  I don't want to come to children.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  Here it is.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  Have a conversation. Calm down.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  Let the site.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  No, I'm not having a conversation.
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  Oh yeah, calm down.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  More at this little bit of shit.
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  Guess the pandemic's over.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  What's wrong, sir?
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  You like killing babies?
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  You love killing babies?
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  Yeah, I love killing babies.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  You love killing babies, huh?
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  You love that, don't you?
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  You love that.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  A treat, sir.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  You got to repent, sir.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  You got to repent, sir, for murdering babies.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  Why?
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  Because it's a sin before God.
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  Why?
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  Stinky breath.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  Yeah, it's pretty evil, you sir.
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  Yeah, I am.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  And I hope and pray that you...
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  Well, that's what you do to babies, huh?
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  Yeah, I love it.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  You love it, huh?
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  Yeah, I do.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  Okay, I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  Oh, I'd ever go to Christ.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  No, I don't go to Christ.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  Yeah, you...
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  I don't listen to Christ.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  You will have a darkened heart, sir.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  I do have a darkened heart.
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  Yeah.
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  You have a darkened heart?
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  I do.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  I do very, very much.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  And you will stand before God in judgment day?
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  Yes, I will.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  Every day.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  You will stand before God in judgment day?
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  Yes, I will.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  Every day.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  All the babies in that field.
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  Yeah, I will.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  Yeah, keep tearing the babies apart.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  Yeah, I will.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  Keep tearing the babies apart.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  I will.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  Keep tearing the babies apart.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  Oh, yes, I will.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  Yeah, sir.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  The babies, their blood streams from the ground.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  Their blood streams from the ground.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  You are a murderer, sir.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  You are a murderer.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  Yes, sir.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:09.560]  For radio listeners that don't know, he's in his face hissing like a demon with a pair
[1:23:09.560 --> 1:23:12.640]  of scissors in his hand.
[1:23:12.640 --> 1:23:17.360]  And ladies and gentlemen, if you don't believe me, I'm begging you, go to a pro-death rally.
[1:23:17.360 --> 1:23:20.600]  And these people are the majority.
[1:23:20.600 --> 1:23:25.000]  Not the minority now, women, men, old people, young people, black people, brown people,
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:28.740]  but majority white people literally hissing and acting like demons.
[1:23:28.740 --> 1:23:30.320]  You can't make this up.
[1:23:30.320 --> 1:23:33.800]  And we can't show you the footage of these pedophile pride parades.
[1:23:33.800 --> 1:23:35.320]  You got to go to one for yourself.
[1:23:35.320 --> 1:23:36.760]  You got to see it for yourself.
[1:23:36.760 --> 1:23:37.920]  It's so unbelievable.
[1:23:37.920 --> 1:23:39.640]  They're eating feces off the ground.
[1:23:39.640 --> 1:23:41.160]  They're, I can't even say it on air.
[1:23:41.160 --> 1:23:44.800]  And I even feel evil repeating this stuff, folks, but you got to know.
[1:23:44.800 --> 1:23:46.080]  So the poison's coming out.
[1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:47.260]  The world's seeing it.
[1:23:47.260 --> 1:23:51.720]  Very eloquent words by John Henry Weston, everybody should visit LifesiteNews.com.
[1:23:51.720 --> 1:23:54.200]  Next segment we'll have the floor, but I wanted to spend some time there.
[1:23:54.200 --> 1:23:57.720]  But in the five minutes we have left in the shorter segment, what do you make of what
[1:23:57.720 --> 1:23:58.720]  we just saw?
[1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:02.160]  Doesn't that illustrate what you're saying about the mask is coming off the demons?
[1:24:02.160 --> 1:24:07.100]  We see that in the Bible historically that when the devil starts losing, he drops the
[1:24:07.100 --> 1:24:09.200]  mask.
[1:24:09.200 --> 1:24:10.200]  It does indeed.
[1:24:10.200 --> 1:24:11.960]  It's an incredible thing.
[1:24:11.960 --> 1:24:13.840]  It's happening everywhere.
[1:24:13.840 --> 1:24:18.960]  I second you in encouraging people to go to pro-abortion demonstrations.
[1:24:18.960 --> 1:24:21.920]  In fact, just go to the March for Life.
[1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:23.880]  You'll find the protesters at the March for Life.
[1:24:23.880 --> 1:24:28.200]  In fact, when we were at the March for Life just recently in Canada, there was a guy at
[1:24:28.200 --> 1:24:30.360]  the back with a satanic flag.
[1:24:30.360 --> 1:24:31.760]  He was screaming, Hail Satan.
[1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:33.800]  We asked him, why are you here?
[1:24:33.800 --> 1:24:34.800]  Because I'm a Satanist.
[1:24:34.800 --> 1:24:37.320]  So you're at the Pro-abortion March because you're a Satanist?
[1:24:37.320 --> 1:24:38.320]  Yes.
[1:24:38.320 --> 1:24:41.240]  We also talked to one of these handmaids, women.
[1:24:41.240 --> 1:24:45.560]  He was 30, 32, 33 degrees Celsius.
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:48.240]  So in Fahrenheit, it's over 90.
[1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:52.280]  And we asked her, what are you doing here?
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:55.840]  Why are you doing this when it's so hot and yet you're doing this?
[1:24:55.840 --> 1:24:58.360]  She said it's spiritual.
[1:24:58.360 --> 1:25:00.440]  So it's very real.
[1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:02.280]  It's very out there.
[1:25:02.280 --> 1:25:04.120]  This is a satanic movement.
[1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:07.720]  The mask is coming down and you're able to see it for yourself.
[1:25:07.720 --> 1:25:13.120]  And hopefully a lot of that middle America that isn't really on either side, but they're
[1:25:13.120 --> 1:25:18.080]  generally what they call pro-choice, we want women to do what they do, finally can see
[1:25:18.080 --> 1:25:24.240]  wait a minute, gee, this is really the side of evil.
[1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:25.240]  And it's time to wake up.
[1:25:25.240 --> 1:25:27.360]  It's time to turn around.
[1:25:27.360 --> 1:25:34.160]  And really on the part of those who value life, those who value God, we have to understand
[1:25:34.160 --> 1:25:35.960]  this is on us.
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:42.440]  Remember what the scriptures say, if my people will turn from their wicked ways, if they
[1:25:42.440 --> 1:25:48.240]  will turn to me and heed my voice, I will bless their land.
[1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:53.560]  The whole land, the whole of the United States of America, the whole of the West will be
[1:25:53.560 --> 1:25:59.960]  blessed if Christians turn to Christ, if Christians get on their knees.
[1:25:59.960 --> 1:26:05.320]  The only way we got to the overturning of Roe v. Wade in the Dove's decision just now
[1:26:05.320 --> 1:26:08.200]  was because of prayer.
[1:26:08.200 --> 1:26:13.400]  Get your prayer pants on, wear out those praying knees as the song says.
[1:26:13.400 --> 1:26:14.960]  This is what we need in America.
[1:26:14.960 --> 1:26:17.280]  This is what we need in the whole of the world.
[1:26:17.280 --> 1:26:20.560]  And this is the path to victory.
[1:26:20.560 --> 1:26:22.320]  And Christ has already won that victory.
[1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:28.760]  It's just ours now to join Him in our own little sacrifices with His on the cross.
[1:26:28.760 --> 1:26:31.760]  And for that we will be blessed in amazing ways.
[1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:33.320]  What do you expect Him to do next?
[1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:34.320]  They're threatening violence.
[1:26:34.320 --> 1:26:35.320]  They're carrying out violence.
[1:26:35.320 --> 1:26:36.720]  They are just beside themselves.
[1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:38.760]  They're talking about packing the court.
[1:26:38.760 --> 1:26:40.320]  They're talking about impeaching the court.
[1:26:40.320 --> 1:26:42.240]  I mean, they are in a red rage.
[1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:43.680]  How do you see this affect the election?
[1:26:43.680 --> 1:26:44.680]  I think it backfires.
[1:26:44.680 --> 1:26:46.960]  I think it energizes Christians and conservatives.
[1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:50.520]  And as you said, short story, not name-dropping is where I was.
[1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:54.440]  I was at my, you know, he's a big Christian now, been a Christian a long time.
[1:26:54.440 --> 1:26:59.440]  But Jesse James, famous outlaw guy, and his wife, he's been marrying a really nice lady,
[1:26:59.440 --> 1:27:01.240]  but with her own story passed.
[1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:05.720]  And a bunch of these friends were there, some of which I've known for years, because I've
[1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:07.920]  known Jesse for a long time.
[1:27:07.920 --> 1:27:09.800]  And they're all right-wing conservatives now.
[1:27:09.800 --> 1:27:10.920]  He's been a right-winger forever.
[1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:12.680]  But they're all right-wing conservatives now.
[1:27:12.680 --> 1:27:14.160]  They used to be super liberal women.
[1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:17.160]  And we're sitting around the table, they're like, I used to be pro-abortionally.
[1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:18.160]  It was just a choice.
[1:27:18.160 --> 1:27:19.160]  And, you know, it doesn't feel anything.
[1:27:19.160 --> 1:27:23.360]  They go, now I know it's about a power and control, and it's a ritual, and it's evil.
[1:27:23.360 --> 1:27:28.200]  And all these liberal women who've been liberal are now super right-wing Christians without
[1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:29.200]  even having to go to church.
[1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:32.280]  And, of course, I went to church with Jesse as well and his wife yesterday, but the thing
[1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:37.240]  is, is that they're being converted by seeing the evil of these minions.
[1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:40.800]  They're like, I don't want to be like that person, because they see how soulless and
[1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:42.680]  ugly and horrible they are.
[1:27:42.680 --> 1:27:47.120]  And it makes them scared, gosh, I don't want to be one of those.
[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:49.840]  You know, it's truly amazing, Alex.
[1:27:49.840 --> 1:28:00.360]  Karma Makurvi, the row of Roe V. Wade, was herself taken in by abortion supporters who
[1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:05.640]  basically sort of cajoled her into doing what she did.
[1:28:05.640 --> 1:28:07.680]  And she saw the light after.
[1:28:07.680 --> 1:28:09.440]  She had a conversion.
[1:28:09.440 --> 1:28:10.520]  She became a Christian.
[1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:14.440]  She fought for life for the rest of her life.
[1:28:14.440 --> 1:28:19.560]  And she was, of course, scarred by what happened to her, but she worked with an organization
[1:28:19.560 --> 1:28:23.680]  called Silent No More, which is connected to Priests for Life, the great Father Frank
[1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:29.800]  Pavone and his great friend and co-worker Janet Morana.
[1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:34.520]  And they were with Norma as Norma was dying.
[1:28:34.520 --> 1:28:41.120]  And she begged them to continue the fight until Roe V. Wade was overturned.
[1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:47.080]  And I texted them on Friday, the both of them, Father Pavone and Janet Morana.
[1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:52.120]  And I said to them, you can tell Norma now, promise fulfilled.
[1:28:52.120 --> 1:28:53.120]  Beautiful.
[1:28:53.120 --> 1:28:54.120]  Stay there.
[1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:55.120]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:55.120 --> 1:28:56.120]  They promised that they would work.
[1:28:56.120 --> 1:28:57.120]  Let's repeat that when we come back.
[1:28:57.120 --> 1:29:03.320]  There's an old Bedouin saying that's thousands of years old and it goes like this, trust
[1:29:03.320 --> 1:29:05.720]  in God, but tie up your camel.
[1:29:05.720 --> 1:29:10.400]  Hunter S. Thompson put it this way, pray to God, but row away from the rocks.
[1:29:10.400 --> 1:29:14.480]  If your boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God that you don't get smashed on him
[1:29:14.480 --> 1:29:15.480]  and killed.
[1:29:15.480 --> 1:29:16.480]  But also try to row away.
[1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:20.520]  You can't just sit there like a jellyfish and it's the same thing with our immune system.
[1:29:20.520 --> 1:29:22.600]  God helps those who help themselves.

[1:29:57.720 --> 1:30:03.360]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[1:30:03.360 --> 1:30:04.880]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[1:30:04.880 --> 1:30:10.600]  Well, it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew this was coming, I tried to stop it
[1:30:10.600 --> 1:30:15.800]  and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[1:30:15.800 --> 1:30:20.960]  the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents.
[1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:22.600]  It's now out in the open.
[1:30:22.600 --> 1:30:28.200]  Claw Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg Group founded Davos
[1:30:28.200 --> 1:30:29.200]  Group.
[1:30:29.200 --> 1:30:34.280]  So now the fight's out in the open, they're making their move because they know they're
[1:30:34.280 --> 1:30:35.280]  behind schedule.
[1:30:35.280 --> 1:30:36.280]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:30:36.280 --> 1:30:38.240]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:42.000]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:45.400]  your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[1:30:45.400 --> 1:30:49.760]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are
[1:30:49.760 --> 1:30:52.120]  the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:30:52.120 --> 1:30:56.640]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[1:30:56.640 --> 1:30:57.640]  your efforts.
[1:30:57.640 --> 1:31:03.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, high quality, storeable food is back in stock, ready to ship right

[1:31:33.160 --> 1:31:36.960]  wars, everything's happening is one of the most important as you can make is to have
[1:31:36.960 --> 1:31:40.800]  high quality, storeable food, water filtration, air filtration and more, and it's not just
[1:31:40.800 --> 1:31:45.160]  those items, it's hundreds of other high quality, preparedness items and survival items right

[1:31:54.040 --> 1:31:57.360]  is get ahead of inflation now because the inflation is just beginning.
[1:31:57.360 --> 1:31:59.240]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[1:31:59.240 --> 1:32:00.680]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:32:00.680 --> 1:32:01.680]  Good, bro.
[1:32:01.680 --> 1:32:02.680]  Great last caller.
[1:32:02.680 --> 1:32:09.800]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements, it's basically the only
[1:32:09.800 --> 1:32:14.880]  way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization and absurdity, it's like
[1:32:14.880 --> 1:32:16.760]  we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[1:32:16.760 --> 1:32:19.720]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire, Eric, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[1:32:19.720 --> 1:32:21.240]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[1:32:21.240 --> 1:32:24.240]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:28.000]  The XG Group does wonders, they recommend it to everybody, you're on the fence about
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:31.200]  it, get off the fence, get the product, support the import war.
[1:32:31.200 --> 1:32:33.920]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[1:32:33.920 --> 1:32:36.560]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you, it's an honor.
[1:32:36.560 --> 1:32:37.560]  Honored talk to you.
[1:32:37.560 --> 1:32:38.560]  Awesome.
[1:32:38.560 --> 1:32:44.120]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products, alpha power, even at 29, if
[1:32:44.120 --> 1:32:48.960]  you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps with the bedroom, so just number one
[1:32:48.960 --> 1:32:49.960]  for a few of you.
[1:32:49.960 --> 1:32:51.960]  I like that one, he works, it's not a joke.
[1:32:51.960 --> 1:32:52.960]  Absolutely.
[1:32:52.960 --> 1:33:20.320]  As you can see in here, he's a very eloquent, smart individual and we should try to get
[1:33:20.320 --> 1:33:21.320]  him on more often.
[1:33:21.320 --> 1:33:26.440]  He's a busy guy, hard to get on, John Henry Weston, LifeSiteNews.com, I want to just say
[1:33:26.440 --> 1:33:30.280]  this, he got caught off by the break, wanted to tell that story over again because it was
[1:33:30.280 --> 1:33:33.880]  bringing tears to my eyes and his as well and I think it leads into my next question,
[1:33:33.880 --> 1:33:37.600]  but I want to really try to not be so excited and give him the floor to cover other key
[1:33:37.600 --> 1:33:40.600]  aspects, he's one of the leading experts in the world on the pro-life movement and how
[1:33:40.600 --> 1:33:47.480]  it ties into everything and this battle between good versus evil, but I think you were expanding
[1:33:47.480 --> 1:33:51.520]  into the fact that people have invested time, energy, their will, people have been sent
[1:33:51.520 --> 1:33:57.400]  to prison for peacefully protesting, this is a big win, but the real battle to win the
[1:33:57.400 --> 1:34:02.320]  war is now just starting and if we just hold the line against all their venom and hate
[1:34:02.320 --> 1:34:07.080]  and violence, we're going to see a huge revival coming out of this and you can already see
[1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:10.840]  it, so we've just got to hold the line, but please, finish your story, elaborate on that
[1:34:10.840 --> 1:34:14.320]  and then other facets you'd like to get into.
[1:34:14.320 --> 1:34:21.480]  So the story really is of Norma McCorvey, the role of Roe V. Wade, who after she was
[1:34:21.480 --> 1:34:29.840]  used by abortion supporters to do this law in 1973 and just the horror of it, that affected
[1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:35.840]  her for the rest of her life and she eventually was converted to be pro-life, then to be a
[1:34:35.840 --> 1:34:42.200]  Christian, and finally she worked as a Catholic with priests for life and also Silent No More,
[1:34:42.200 --> 1:34:48.480]  an organization of women who had themselves had abortions and speak out now for life trying
[1:34:48.480 --> 1:34:53.440]  to get other women to avoid the damage that was caused them by abortion.
[1:34:53.440 --> 1:35:00.840]  And so Norma, as she was dying, she held the hand of Janet Morana, now the head of Silent
[1:35:00.840 --> 1:35:10.560]  No More and she basically begged Father Frank Pavone and Janet Morana to see to it that
[1:35:10.560 --> 1:35:18.280]  the end of Roe V. Wade would happen and I texted them on Friday to tell them that indeed
[1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:22.320]  promised fulfilled is what you can tell Norma now as she's in the afterlife.
[1:35:22.320 --> 1:35:23.800]  That is powerful.
[1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:30.520]  Again, I've got a lot of questions here, John Henry, but what other areas should we be aware
[1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:31.520]  of?
[1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:32.520]  What should we be looking for?
[1:35:32.520 --> 1:35:33.520]  What's the next leg of the battle?
[1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:37.320]  It looks to me like they're going to push morning after pills and vending machines, I mean they're
[1:35:37.320 --> 1:35:38.320]  saying that's their plan.
[1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:41.360]  Is that something big to be watching?
[1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:43.440]  Well it is indeed.
[1:35:43.440 --> 1:35:50.520]  The fact of abortion being killing and child sacrifice is very real so that when they do
[1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:56.480]  it, no matter how small the children are, it's still abortion, it's still killing babies.
[1:35:56.480 --> 1:36:00.320]  And the effect on the people's souls is also still there.
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:05.600]  So whether they're doing it by a morning after pill or the abortion pill, the early abortion
[1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:08.280]  pill, whatever they're using, they're damaging.
[1:36:08.280 --> 1:36:12.800]  Now in addition to the spiritual harm that it causes, the fact that you are engaging
[1:36:12.800 --> 1:36:18.680]  in murder and associating yourself with murder, there is also the physical health consequences
[1:36:18.680 --> 1:36:19.680]  to the mother.
[1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:25.120]  They take these drugs which are deadly and then they don't get the proper medical care
[1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:30.720]  afterward because very often abortionists are concerned basically about getting the
[1:36:30.720 --> 1:36:33.120]  job done in terms of killing the baby.
[1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:38.240]  And as we've seen so many countless times, they don't really give a care about the woman
[1:36:38.240 --> 1:36:39.240]  after the fact.
[1:36:39.240 --> 1:36:43.080]  If she bleeds to death, oh well that's on her.
[1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:47.680]  It's unbelievable and who's there to pick up the pieces on the other side of abortion?
[1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:49.520]  The pro-life movement as well.
[1:36:49.520 --> 1:36:51.560]  So that's an incredible thing you can look at.
[1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:59.320]  But what is coming up is yes, that pushing, but there's also the want to do it anyway.
[1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:04.440]  I believe it was Senator Warren is talking about getting Biden to make for some kind
[1:37:04.440 --> 1:37:12.600]  of area inside the states where abortion is now illegal to do it anyway.
[1:37:12.600 --> 1:37:16.800]  They're going to try anything by hook or by crook because again for them this is like
[1:37:16.800 --> 1:37:19.280]  a sacrament as you said.
[1:37:19.280 --> 1:37:23.320]  And they might be deluded with this is a women's right and so on, but what's coming out now
[1:37:23.320 --> 1:37:30.000]  with all of the violence and the extremity is many people will see it for what it really
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:31.200]  is.
[1:37:31.200 --> 1:37:33.920]  And God willing we'll have more pushback.
[1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:38.120]  So we'll see this, this war fight out and it will be a war.
[1:37:38.120 --> 1:37:43.040]  They've already shown that they will commit violence, not only violence against children
[1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:47.040]  in the womb, they're firebombing churches and pregnancy centers.
[1:37:47.040 --> 1:37:52.900]  Jane's revenge that organization to somehow publicly threatening people talked about even
[1:37:52.900 --> 1:38:00.840]  how the next actions they take won't be as simple as cleaning up from a fire or some
[1:38:00.840 --> 1:38:02.080]  vandalism.
[1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:09.280]  So they're talking about real actual harmful violence that might kill people who knows
[1:38:09.280 --> 1:38:13.120]  what they're talking about, but this is very real.
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:17.880]  And so we have to be ready for that on faith and reason, which was one of the shows that
[1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:25.280]  Lifesight puts out, we spoke of how churches and pregnancy centers need to protect themselves.
[1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:28.520]  Churches for instance, need to develop security teams.
[1:38:28.520 --> 1:38:33.360]  We talked about how outside your church, you might park a van, a security van outside.
[1:38:33.360 --> 1:38:36.840]  A lot of churches are already doing this, they're shutting down most entrances, having
[1:38:36.840 --> 1:38:42.080]  people only enter through the one entrance so that ushers and your security team can
[1:38:42.080 --> 1:38:43.080]  be there.
[1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:49.120]  So if that's really neat, you can involve all those young men, those young men between
[1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:53.320]  the ages of 19 and 25 who you very rarely see at church.
[1:38:53.320 --> 1:38:54.320]  You know what?
[1:38:54.320 --> 1:38:55.320]  They've got a job now.
[1:38:55.320 --> 1:39:01.360]  They can put all of those muscles and their bigness to the test by the church needs protection.
[1:39:01.360 --> 1:39:03.800]  Your parents, your grandparents need protection.
[1:39:03.800 --> 1:39:08.400]  Your little brothers and sisters or your nephews and nieces need protection.
[1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:14.000]  Come and stand there and protect the house of God at the same time, they can hear the
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:18.360]  message of the Lord and they can come on side with the faith in Jesus Christ, which will
[1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:20.480]  lead them to embrace life.
[1:39:20.480 --> 1:39:23.320]  There's opportunity in all of this for us.
[1:39:23.320 --> 1:39:28.600]  So even though, yes, there's hard times coming, we need to pull up our bootstraps, we need
[1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:29.920]  to work really hard.
[1:39:29.920 --> 1:39:37.000]  We have an opportunity now to save lives and to work now in the state legislatures to get
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:39.880]  to the point where we can elect pro-life representatives.
[1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:47.200]  And that's why, as you keep saying, to make sure elections are fair and properly run is
[1:39:47.200 --> 1:39:50.760]  so key to what we're going to see in November.
[1:39:50.760 --> 1:39:56.280]  Expanding on that, I mean, you track all this at Lifesite News, but it doesn't make national
[1:39:56.280 --> 1:40:01.320]  news, but every day Antifa is attacking a pregnancy center, every day they're attacking
[1:40:01.320 --> 1:40:02.320]  another church.
[1:40:02.320 --> 1:40:07.360]  And I see countless videos, even in DC, of the left just randomly go pick a Catholic
[1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:11.840]  church and go inside for breaking stuff or screaming at people and just doing all this
[1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:12.840]  psychotic stuff.
[1:40:12.840 --> 1:40:18.320]  I mean, they literally hate God, they hate churches, they see it as the enemy and even
[1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:22.120]  in jurisdictions where abortion is still legal, they go attack the police.
[1:40:22.120 --> 1:40:26.640]  I mean, they're just frothing with hatred and the things they say, the things they do,
[1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:27.640]  we can't even put on air.
[1:40:27.640 --> 1:40:34.080]  I mean, it's unspeakable that they think this is going to sell everyone on the practice
[1:40:34.080 --> 1:40:37.080]  of killing children when they are our best advertising against them.
[1:40:37.080 --> 1:40:41.280]  I know I keep going back to that, but that's what you predicted would happen, that's what
[1:40:41.280 --> 1:40:46.680]  the Bible tells us would happen, that's why we know as these end times come, we'll see
[1:40:46.680 --> 1:40:48.720]  the biggest revival ever on earth.
[1:40:48.720 --> 1:40:53.400]  So yeah, the Antichrist wins for a season, but then that's actually the war that the
[1:40:53.400 --> 1:40:54.720]  devil loses.
[1:40:54.720 --> 1:41:02.080]  It's an amazing thing, you know, how is it that even when so many church leaders have
[1:41:02.080 --> 1:41:06.880]  really lost their way, they've basically gone into the democratic camp, they hardly ever
[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:12.440]  talk about abortion at all, they're, you know, they're trying to be on the uppity-up with
[1:41:12.440 --> 1:41:18.480]  everything, not condemning LGBT anything, sometimes even participating in private days,
[1:41:18.480 --> 1:41:27.240]  total insanity, and yet the devil still sees the church as the enemy and therefore gets
[1:41:27.240 --> 1:41:32.280]  the people whom he has in his clutches to go and protest in, why are they protesting in
[1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:33.680]  Catholic churches?
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:40.400]  Why are women basically going nudes with slogans of the need for abortion in Catholic
[1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:41.800]  churches?
[1:41:41.800 --> 1:41:43.680]  What are they doing?
[1:41:43.680 --> 1:41:49.200]  It's disturbing as heck for sure, but it's also demonstrating a couple of things, one
[1:41:49.200 --> 1:41:56.880]  for all the mushy middle, sheesh, this is what we're fighting for, this is the right
[1:41:56.880 --> 1:42:01.760]  to women's choice, this is really evil.
[1:42:01.760 --> 1:42:11.400]  And then also it convinces the people that, wait a minute, this is satanic and we need
[1:42:11.400 --> 1:42:12.840]  to wake up.
[1:42:12.840 --> 1:42:18.800]  And I think that's part of the effort here, the need to wake up the whole middle ground
[1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:22.960]  so they can see this for what it is, and that's happening now.
[1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:27.160]  And the media, of course, is playing its game, it's unwilling to cover.
[1:42:27.160 --> 1:42:34.040]  As of already last week, we had over 23 crisis pregnancy centers, fire bombed and vandalized
[1:42:34.040 --> 1:42:38.800]  and destroyed, and there's more of that happening every single day.
[1:42:38.800 --> 1:42:42.720]  Check out LifeSiteNews.com, you'll see it report by report by report.
[1:42:42.720 --> 1:42:46.640]  We're seeing the same thing at Catholic churches, at Christian churches everywhere.
[1:42:46.640 --> 1:42:47.640]  It's accelerating.
[1:42:47.640 --> 1:42:49.840]  Do one more segment with us, do about five more minutes to the next segment, because
[1:42:49.840 --> 1:42:53.400]  I want to ask you big picture how this ties in with our other agendas and how we fight
[1:42:53.400 --> 1:42:58.400]  back against it, LifeSiteNews.com and Alex Jones, then FullWars.
[1:42:58.400 --> 1:43:04.880]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all.
[1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:09.160]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[1:43:09.160 --> 1:43:14.920]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare, and that alone is something to
[1:43:14.920 --> 1:43:16.360]  be grateful for.
[1:43:16.360 --> 1:43:21.840]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of
[1:43:21.840 --> 1:43:24.360]  your taps getting shut off.
[1:43:24.360 --> 1:43:29.840]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[1:43:29.840 --> 1:43:34.320]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider
[1:43:34.320 --> 1:43:37.120]  stocking up for your neighbors.
[1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:42.640]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by
[1:43:42.640 --> 1:43:47.320]  having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[1:43:47.320 --> 1:43:52.400]  Whoever sews bountifully will also reap bountifully.

[1:43:59.160 --> 1:44:03.200]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going
[1:44:03.200 --> 1:44:06.720]  on both at home and the world at large.
[1:44:06.720 --> 1:44:11.280]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep

[1:44:20.040 --> 1:44:22.840]  get the shut-eye you deserve.

[1:44:27.160 --> 1:44:32.760]  the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[1:44:32.760 --> 1:44:37.200]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[1:44:37.200 --> 1:44:42.400]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally
[1:44:42.400 --> 1:44:48.120]  used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[1:44:48.120 --> 1:44:52.400]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will
[1:44:52.400 --> 1:44:54.280]  be Down and Out.

[1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:27.000]  In two weeks I went from brain fog to literally like my brain was enlightened.
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:31.880]  I could think again, I could connect with people again and over the course of the next
[1:45:31.880 --> 1:45:36.640]  couple of years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[1:45:36.640 --> 1:45:38.640]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:40.680]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[1:45:40.680 --> 1:45:43.600]  It literally, like if you want to sleep just take it, it's amazing.
[1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:44.600]  It works.
[1:45:44.600 --> 1:45:48.120]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[1:45:48.120 --> 1:45:49.120]  the globalist system.
[1:45:49.120 --> 1:45:52.840]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[1:45:52.840 --> 1:45:54.000]  Beautifully said, brother.
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:57.880]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.

[1:46:19.960 --> 1:46:22.480]  is already unfolding with global food shortages.
[1:46:22.480 --> 1:46:26.800]  I told you over two years ago, the globalist is going to have massive inflation and food
[1:46:26.800 --> 1:46:29.920]  shortages and it's happened just like clockwork.
[1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:32.360]  And I'm telling you, it's going to get a lot worse.
[1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:33.680]  They have designed this.
[1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:39.200]  The way to beat them is to buy food now before your dollar is even more devalued.

[1:46:59.040 --> 1:47:17.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:17.720 --> 1:47:23.800]  Last time John Henry was here with us, I told the story and I don't tell it because I'm
[1:47:23.800 --> 1:47:26.040]  proud of what I was involved in.
[1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:29.480]  I tell it because it's really a redemption story.
[1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:34.960]  I was brought up a Christian and I had a relationship with God, but I was promiscuous as a teenager
[1:47:34.960 --> 1:47:41.120]  and it felt very empty and I was depressed over it, but I was still doing it.
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:44.680]  And my dad confronted me and he said, I know you're out there getting girls pregnant and
[1:47:44.680 --> 1:47:49.480]  paying for abortions because I get one of the girls over the house and he talked to her.
[1:47:49.480 --> 1:47:58.280]  My mom did and she was like 17 or 18 like I was and my dad said, quit killing my grandkids
[1:47:58.280 --> 1:48:04.840]  and he said, you're going to wreck your life and wreck all these futures, stop it.
[1:48:04.840 --> 1:48:09.960]  And I remember over the next year being convicted by that and then praying to God to forgive
[1:48:09.960 --> 1:48:17.080]  me and it was like, it was lifted off of me, not even some subconscious guilt that I wasn't
[1:48:17.080 --> 1:48:21.640]  a happy person because of what I was involved in and it doesn't mean I'm perfect today.
[1:48:21.640 --> 1:48:27.680]  The point is, I'm sure it's going to have an abortions and but but people once they've
[1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:31.240]  had abortions, they harden their heart and they get more and more evil till they turn
[1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:32.240]  into these devils.
[1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:35.120]  And about I told my dad, no, I'm not going to listen to you and kept doing that.
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:38.120]  I'd probably be a devil worshiper today.
[1:48:38.120 --> 1:48:39.760]  I mean, that's the path you're on.
[1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:43.120]  You've got to be on a path and I'm telling people, you can break away from that path
[1:48:43.120 --> 1:48:46.760]  and you'll be so fulfilled and so empowered when you get on your knees and say, I repent
[1:48:46.760 --> 1:48:51.240]  to God, come into me, help me be good, put me on the right path and it's a process.
[1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:54.880]  And then life is so much more fulfilling, so much more powerful.
[1:48:54.880 --> 1:48:58.920]  And these people are looking for power from Satan, getting on your knees to Christ.
[1:48:58.920 --> 1:48:59.920]  That's where the real power is.
[1:48:59.920 --> 1:49:02.680]  And I wanted to get your view on that.
[1:49:02.680 --> 1:49:08.720]  No, well, it's absolutely nothing truer than that.
[1:49:08.720 --> 1:49:15.800]  I too come from a very sinful past involved in all sorts of very similar things.
[1:49:15.800 --> 1:49:23.120]  And what led me to this was, first of all, the recognition that this stuff is real, that
[1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:24.120]  the faith is real.
[1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:29.760]  In fact, it came out of the example of my dad, a daily mass, daily rosary Catholic.
[1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:35.440]  But it wasn't just his example of doing that, of spending all his life praying and, gosh,
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:38.920]  I would come home from going to dance clubs two in the morning, still be there praying
[1:49:38.920 --> 1:49:44.520]  in his bedside, sometimes falling asleep and kneeling, but sleeping on the bed.
[1:49:44.520 --> 1:49:49.160]  Really what affected me even more than that was the persecution he received for being
[1:49:49.160 --> 1:49:50.720]  that way.
[1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:56.960]  His family members, myself and my siblings included, his own spouse, his family, his
[1:49:56.960 --> 1:50:03.800]  mom and his siblings, his colleagues at work, all calling him extreme or a freak, whatever,
[1:50:03.800 --> 1:50:06.040]  for being so religious.
[1:50:06.040 --> 1:50:07.040]  You know what?
[1:50:07.040 --> 1:50:08.920]  He did anyway, because he loved Christ.
[1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:12.200]  It was all about love.
[1:50:12.200 --> 1:50:16.720]  And you know that persecution he received for being faithful, that persecution he received
[1:50:16.720 --> 1:50:21.720]  for loving Christ, above all else, was what told me it was real more than any words he
[1:50:21.720 --> 1:50:23.280]  could have said.
[1:50:23.280 --> 1:50:30.040]  And so I was able to embrace Christ myself, thanks to his example, and it gives you the
[1:50:30.040 --> 1:50:31.960]  greatest joy.
[1:50:31.960 --> 1:50:39.200]  It's an incredible thing, and it leads us to also recognize where the world is at and
[1:50:39.200 --> 1:50:45.360]  work for the world's redemption, because all of these people, all of these people, even
[1:50:45.360 --> 1:50:52.280]  those on the other side, even the ones performing the abortions, are still children of God,
[1:50:52.280 --> 1:50:56.240]  and there's still a chance, till they die, to reach them.
[1:50:56.240 --> 1:51:00.200]  Perhaps we can't, but it doesn't stop us from trying.
[1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:05.720]  And so we don't hate the people who are on the other side.
[1:51:05.720 --> 1:51:06.720]  We actually love them.
[1:51:06.720 --> 1:51:07.720]  That's right.
[1:51:07.720 --> 1:51:13.080]  We reach out to them, and that's why such a big movement is in the pro-life movement
[1:51:13.080 --> 1:51:18.000]  to reach out to those on the other side, those committing abortions, assisting it.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:21.560]  Who is Abby Johnson, one of the greatest pro-life leaders that exists in the world today?
[1:51:21.560 --> 1:51:22.680]  Who was she?
[1:51:22.680 --> 1:51:27.440]  She headed up Planned Parenthood Clinics, and she knows the inside story.
[1:51:27.440 --> 1:51:33.360]  And now she runs an organization which seeks to convert and has converted many, many abortion
[1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:34.360]  workers.
[1:51:34.360 --> 1:51:35.360]  And it's so beautiful.
[1:51:35.360 --> 1:51:42.320]  Speaking to that, this Supreme Court is doing so many other great things, but the reason
[1:51:42.320 --> 1:51:46.120]  they're accelerating the censorship, it's come out from some of the big tech leaks,
[1:51:46.120 --> 1:51:50.560]  as you know, is the gathering steam of the pro-life movement through free speech.
[1:51:50.560 --> 1:51:55.000]  And so, surely they wanted to target Alex Jones and Donald Trump, but they're really
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:52:00.560]  going after the movement that is showing people, hey, these are really babies.
[1:52:00.560 --> 1:52:04.600]  This is really a satanic movement, and that's why this newest Supreme Court ruling is really
[1:52:04.600 --> 1:52:05.600]  good.
[1:52:05.600 --> 1:52:07.840]  A bunch more of these are going to come out in the next few days.
[1:52:07.840 --> 1:52:11.680]  Supreme Court says high school football coach can pray at the 50-yard line.
[1:52:11.680 --> 1:52:14.200]  Yes, we don't have a state-run religion.
[1:52:14.200 --> 1:52:18.400]  We have religious freedom in America, but I can hand out Christmas cards, or I can
[1:52:18.400 --> 1:52:23.000]  pray with people if they want to, or I, as a valedictorian, I wasn't a valedictorian,
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:24.880]  but I could say a prayer.
[1:52:24.880 --> 1:52:28.440]  But even when I was a senior in high school, 30-something years ago, they told us, don't
[1:52:28.440 --> 1:52:36.880]  say any prayers, if you say anything at your graduation, and the football team, you can't
[1:52:36.880 --> 1:52:40.520]  pray in public, the coach can't pray at the huddle, that is tyranny.
[1:52:40.520 --> 1:52:42.200]  We individually can do whatever we want.
[1:52:42.200 --> 1:52:43.200]  That's the First Amendment.
[1:52:43.200 --> 1:52:47.000]  The First Amendment defends that, and finally, the Supreme Court said, stop it.
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:49.240]  That's another big victory.
[1:52:49.240 --> 1:52:52.400]  It is absolutely, because this is the thing.
[1:52:52.400 --> 1:52:58.080]  If we remove Christ from the public square, obviously, people who should be able to see
[1:52:58.080 --> 1:53:03.760]  the good example Christians are giving are, that's withdrawn from them.
[1:53:03.760 --> 1:53:05.280]  That's crazy.
[1:53:05.280 --> 1:53:08.800]  We see all of the mother Teresa's of this world.
[1:53:08.800 --> 1:53:13.480]  If she's never allowed to express her faith, people just think, oh, what a great, wonderful
[1:53:13.480 --> 1:53:14.480]  woman.
[1:53:14.480 --> 1:53:15.840]  That's not what she wanted.
[1:53:15.840 --> 1:53:18.360]  She didn't want to be known as a great, wonderful woman.
[1:53:18.360 --> 1:53:22.760]  She wanted to be known as the hands and feet of Jesus, who are here to serve you and to
[1:53:22.760 --> 1:53:28.200]  love you and to reach out to you and invite you into an eternal relationship with Jesus.
[1:53:28.200 --> 1:53:34.320]  That's what it's all about, and if we're forbidden from doing that, it so deprives
[1:53:34.320 --> 1:53:35.320]  the world.
[1:53:35.320 --> 1:53:41.920]  So this is an amazing Supreme Court victory, and all of this is coming too ahead, because
[1:53:41.920 --> 1:53:45.000]  the whole battle in life is all about this.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:47.960]  It's actually all about eternal life.
[1:53:47.960 --> 1:53:52.740]  We're here for, even if we're here for 100 years, that is a blip on the screen, compared
[1:53:52.740 --> 1:53:54.200]  to eternity.
[1:53:54.200 --> 1:54:00.400]  But in that blip, you're going to decide where you spend all of eternity for millions
[1:54:00.400 --> 1:54:04.120]  and billions of years in this shortest period of time.
[1:54:04.120 --> 1:54:05.480]  You've got to make that decision.
[1:54:05.480 --> 1:54:10.480]  And that's why the elites are all gathering to fight all the same agendas.
[1:54:10.480 --> 1:54:13.840]  You mentioned before the break, how does all this work together?
[1:54:13.840 --> 1:54:14.840]  It does.
[1:54:14.840 --> 1:54:21.680]  Look, the same temptation that Satan always had, that he gave to Adam and Eve to pride,
[1:54:21.680 --> 1:54:26.360]  to take power, to take the place of God, to be God's yourself, is given especially to
[1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:28.200]  the elites of this world.
[1:54:28.200 --> 1:54:32.320]  Take the power and lord it over everyone.
[1:54:32.320 --> 1:54:33.320]  And what do they do?
[1:54:33.320 --> 1:54:40.160]  Well, they say, as you know, and you've said for over 20 years, the elites want to control
[1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:41.160]  the population of the world.
[1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:44.280]  They want to bring it down to, what, 500,000 or so?
[1:54:44.280 --> 1:54:47.080]  Excuse me, 500 million or so.
[1:54:47.080 --> 1:54:48.080]  Why?
[1:54:48.080 --> 1:54:49.080]  Why 500 million?
[1:54:49.080 --> 1:54:50.240]  Because it's controllable.
[1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:51.480]  And how do they get there?
[1:54:51.480 --> 1:54:53.160]  Well, population control.
[1:54:53.160 --> 1:54:55.600]  Well, how do we do population control?
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:54:57.080]  Well, contraception.
[1:54:57.080 --> 1:55:01.400]  And the first thing that did was it decoupled the link between sexuality and procreation,
[1:55:01.400 --> 1:55:02.960]  which is absolutely essential.
[1:55:02.960 --> 1:55:06.160]  Why sexuality was created for procreation?
[1:55:06.160 --> 1:55:07.160]  Then what did they do?
[1:55:07.160 --> 1:55:11.040]  They destabilized marriage, because they know that's the building block of society.
[1:55:11.040 --> 1:55:15.120]  And that is what keeps families grounded, and they don't want children grounded.
[1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:19.960]  They want them subsidiaries of the state, not of parents, so they attack marriage.
[1:55:19.960 --> 1:55:26.640]  And then they attack life itself, both in early term and late term abortion.
[1:55:26.640 --> 1:55:28.560]  And so all of this works together.
[1:55:28.560 --> 1:55:33.880]  And of course, homosexuality is sexuality apart from procreation as well.
[1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:37.480]  And now they've got the transgenderism to sterilize the children.
[1:55:37.480 --> 1:55:42.440]  It's all about decoupling us from God's order, making us basically domesticated corporate
[1:55:42.440 --> 1:55:43.440]  commodities.
[1:55:43.440 --> 1:55:46.320]  I mean, you can see the cold-bloodedness of this.
[1:55:46.320 --> 1:55:47.400]  Absolutely.
[1:55:47.400 --> 1:55:54.040]  And with COVID came a forwarding of this agenda, like, was very hard to see in the past.
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:55:59.520]  How could we fast forward this so fast to get us to a point where we'll all be subjected
[1:55:59.520 --> 1:56:02.240]  to a tyranny almost immediately?
[1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:03.400]  And it worked.
[1:56:03.400 --> 1:56:05.240]  They shut down churches.
[1:56:05.240 --> 1:56:07.000]  They made you stay in your home.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:12.120]  They forced you to get an abortion tainted jab under pain of losing your job, your livelihood,
[1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:17.320]  or being unable to see your parents dying in the hospital, and being unable to get treatment
[1:56:17.320 --> 1:56:23.160]  in a hospital for, you know, whatever disorder you may have, life-threatening doesn't matter.
[1:56:23.160 --> 1:56:26.480]  You need to get this abortion tainted jab, otherwise we're not going to treat you.
[1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:27.880]  And it was done.
[1:56:27.880 --> 1:56:28.880]  It all happened.
[1:56:28.880 --> 1:56:29.880]  That's right.
[1:56:29.880 --> 1:56:30.880]  We're out of time.
[1:56:30.880 --> 1:56:31.880]  I want to close this.
[1:56:31.880 --> 1:56:35.160]  John Henry Weston, life-sightednews.com, with this.
[1:56:35.160 --> 1:56:38.840]  Even the Daily Mail, even the London Telegraph, even the Associated Press, where I've run
[1:56:38.840 --> 1:56:41.040]  this video, of scientists don't know why.
[1:56:41.040 --> 1:56:44.640]  When the sperm makes it into the egg, there's an electrochemical explosion they can't even
[1:56:44.640 --> 1:56:49.960]  describe, because that's literally the new life, the new entity, with a spiritual connection
[1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:52.840]  to the higher dimensions of God, being activated.
[1:56:52.840 --> 1:56:55.400]  And scientists don't know why this happens.
[1:56:55.400 --> 1:57:00.160]  There it is, right there, an explosion of energy when those things come together.
[1:57:00.160 --> 1:57:01.360]  We are magic.
[1:57:01.360 --> 1:57:02.360]  God made us.
[1:57:02.360 --> 1:57:08.240]  We have a special destiny, and to deny that is to let these evil men that serve Satan
[1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:12.800]  become lords over us and pretend to be God when it's all a fraud.
[1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:13.800]  Thank you so much.
[1:57:13.800 --> 1:57:14.800]  God bless you.
[1:57:14.800 --> 1:57:15.800]  God bless you.
[1:57:15.800 --> 1:57:16.800]  That was a powerful interview.
[1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:17.800]  Okay.
[1:57:17.800 --> 1:57:18.800]  Look, I got a ton of news across the board that all ties back together here.
[1:57:18.800 --> 1:57:19.800]  We're going to come back and we're going to cover it.
[1:57:19.800 --> 1:57:20.800]  I didn't plug any of this hour, and we're, again, barely in the black right now.
[1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:21.800]  We'll continue down this road another few months.
[1:57:21.800 --> 1:57:22.800]  We'll be back in the red.
[1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:23.800]  So please go to infoworkstore.com.
[1:57:23.800 --> 1:57:24.800]  We're doing important work.
[1:57:24.800 --> 1:57:25.800]  We've got great products, great films, great books, portable foods, everything.
[1:57:25.800 --> 1:57:26.800]  infoworkstore.com.
[1:57:26.800 --> 1:57:27.800]  Or preparetoday.com.
[1:57:27.800 --> 1:57:28.800]  Stay with us.
[1:57:28.800 --> 1:57:29.800]  We'll be right back.
[1:57:29.800 --> 1:57:30.800]  We'll be right back.
[1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:31.800]  We'll be right back.
[1:57:31.800 --> 1:57:32.800]  We'll be right back.
[1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:33.800]  We'll be right back.
[1:57:33.800 --> 1:57:34.800]  We'll be right back.
[1:57:34.800 --> 1:57:47.800]  We'll be right back.
[1:57:47.800 --> 1:57:52.800]  The Internet and Talk Radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones is right.
[1:57:52.800 --> 1:57:54.800]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[1:57:54.800 --> 1:57:58.800]  Well, it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[1:57:58.800 --> 1:58:00.800]  I tried to stop it.
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:05.800]  And now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[1:58:05.800 --> 1:58:10.800]  the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents.
[1:58:10.800 --> 1:58:12.800]  It's now out in the open.
[1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:18.120]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos
[1:58:18.120 --> 1:58:19.120]  Group.
[1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:22.160]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[1:58:22.160 --> 1:58:25.360]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[1:58:25.360 --> 1:58:26.360]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:58:26.360 --> 1:58:28.240]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[1:58:28.240 --> 1:58:31.960]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and
[1:58:31.960 --> 1:58:35.400]  your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[1:58:35.400 --> 1:58:39.720]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are
[1:58:39.720 --> 1:58:42.080]  the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:58:42.080 --> 1:58:46.600]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[1:58:46.600 --> 1:58:47.600]  your efforts.
[1:58:47.600 --> 1:58:49.240]  The globalists are making their move.
[1:58:49.240 --> 1:58:51.160]  Their great reset is here.
[1:58:51.160 --> 1:58:52.680]  They're coming for your children.
[1:58:52.680 --> 1:58:55.000]  They're coming for the value of your currency.
[1:58:55.000 --> 1:58:57.120]  They're coming for your national sovereignty.
[1:58:57.120 --> 1:59:01.840]  They're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny.
[1:59:01.840 --> 1:59:04.160]  They're coming for your free speech.
[1:59:04.160 --> 1:59:06.000]  They're coming for your privacy.
[1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:10.920]  And ladies and gentlemen, they're coming for your right to vote and have your representative
[1:59:10.920 --> 1:59:14.400]  in government that you and your fellow Americans choose.
[1:59:14.400 --> 1:59:20.040]  The new film, the seminal film, the most important documentary ever made in my view, 2000 mules
[1:59:20.040 --> 1:59:25.600]  is now available on DVD with expanded extras at info wars store.com.
[1:59:25.600 --> 1:59:32.920]  You can also get the powerful film with other documentaries discounted at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:32.920 --> 1:59:36.320]  Everyone needs this DVD in their library to show everyone you know.
[1:59:36.320 --> 1:59:39.200]  We have the tools to bring these criminals to justice.
[1:59:39.200 --> 1:59:41.400]  They're planning to run the same scams again.
[1:59:41.400 --> 1:59:44.000]  This film can stop them if you take action.
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  infowarstore.com.
[1:59:45.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  2000 mules.
[1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:55.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:59:55.000 --> 2:00:11.160]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[2:00:11.160 --> 2:00:36.160]  front lines of the info war.
[2:00:41.160 --> 2:01:08.160]  Look at you, I love you.
[2:01:08.160 --> 2:01:20.200]  Cute.
[2:01:20.200 --> 2:01:37.000]  They look equal.
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:09.620]  My choice!
[2:02:09.620 --> 2:02:12.520]  My choice!
[2:02:12.520 --> 2:02:14.040]  My choice!
[2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:17.280]  My choice!
[2:02:17.280 --> 2:02:19.320]  My choice!
[2:02:19.320 --> 2:02:21.360]  My choice!
[2:02:21.360 --> 2:02:22.800]  My choice!
[2:02:22.800 --> 2:02:26.800]  My choice!
[2:02:26.800 --> 2:02:30.080]  Take this!
[2:02:30.080 --> 2:02:33.160]  Wow, Mon-M!
[2:02:33.160 --> 2:02:59.860]  half
[2:02:59.860 --> 2:03:23.180]  In today's world abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully
[2:03:23.180 --> 2:03:33.180]  activists. If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshippers, maybe you can call the A-team.
[2:03:33.180 --> 2:03:41.180]  How many did I adopt? I killed my kids. I killed my kids.
[2:03:41.180 --> 2:03:47.180]  So one f***ing friend was facing a f***ing male that doesn't stand for women's rights.
[2:03:47.180 --> 2:03:52.180]  Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle. That's pretty cool man.
[2:03:52.180 --> 2:03:59.180]  Is that you on the Facebook? Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[2:03:59.180 --> 2:04:01.180]  I don't think so.
[2:04:01.180 --> 2:04:08.180]  I don't hear children. I f***ing love things.
[2:04:08.180 --> 2:04:10.180]  How do you get your abortion paid for?
[2:04:10.180 --> 2:04:11.180]  I pay for them.
[2:04:11.180 --> 2:04:13.180]  I thought you said three.
[2:04:13.180 --> 2:04:15.180]  Upwards of fifty.
[2:04:15.180 --> 2:04:16.180]  Really?
[2:04:16.180 --> 2:04:20.180]  Oh yeah.
[2:04:20.180 --> 2:04:22.180]  F*** you, you piece of f***ing s***.
[2:04:22.180 --> 2:04:24.180]  Bunch of misogynists and motherf***ers.
[2:04:24.180 --> 2:04:26.180]  Take your male privilege somewhere else.
[2:04:26.180 --> 2:04:27.180]  What's up, are you being aggressive?
[2:04:27.180 --> 2:04:28.180]  I'm being aggressive.
[2:04:28.180 --> 2:04:31.180]  Come on in, Oz! Get him, Oz!
[2:04:31.180 --> 2:04:33.180]  Wow!
[2:04:33.180 --> 2:04:37.180]  These are the guys that attack Alex Jones.

[2:06:38.180 --> 2:06:41.180]  But that's not why he's here.
[2:06:41.180 --> 2:06:43.180]  He is a well-known, really smart political analyst who I've been interviewing for six, seven, eight, nine years.
[2:06:43.180 --> 2:06:44.180]  I forget how long.
[2:06:44.180 --> 2:06:48.180]  And I said please come on the show and talk about what Roe V. Wade means.
[2:06:48.180 --> 2:06:50.180]  What these other big rulings mean.
[2:06:50.180 --> 2:06:55.820]  Revenge over the stolen election 22 election analysis rhinos subverting red wave
[2:06:56.580 --> 2:06:59.260]  22 midterm warning for patriots
[2:06:59.740 --> 2:07:03.120]  One million votes for the GOP seven states vote tomorrow
[2:07:03.780 --> 2:07:10.280]  Mary Miller over Rodney Davis in Illinois. We got so much to cover with Ali Alexander. He's just like him for wars
[2:07:11.620 --> 2:07:18.300]  Persecuted the platformed except it gives in go.com forward slash Ali Alexander and on gab true social
[2:07:18.300 --> 2:07:23.940]  Telegram and Ali Alexander. So be sure and check him out and support what he's doing. All right, Ali
[2:07:23.940 --> 2:07:30.140]  You're always loaded for bear. Let's get right into it. There's so many subjects. What is your analysis of the current state of affairs?
[2:07:31.060 --> 2:07:37.340]  Well, look, you know, I think what's really interesting is that they claimed that Joe Biden got 81 million votes
[2:07:37.540 --> 2:07:39.860]  But you know a few months into his presidency
[2:07:40.420 --> 2:07:42.500]  Analysts were already predicting a red wave
[2:07:42.500 --> 2:07:49.300]  Where was it any indication that if Joe Biden was the most popularly elected president in the United States history?
[2:07:49.420 --> 2:07:54.220]  Garnered more votes than Barack Obama that he was somehow going to face a red wave
[2:07:54.220 --> 2:07:58.980]  And so what's really been interesting is to see how this red wave was going to take shape
[2:07:59.180 --> 2:08:03.700]  Because in 2010, you know, we had a red wave, but it was really an anti-establishment
[2:08:04.780 --> 2:08:06.780]  conservative libertarian wave
[2:08:06.780 --> 2:08:12.980]  Against the Republican establishment and that was huge. What's really interesting about this one is that we've got a
[2:08:13.540 --> 2:08:19.940]  Popular former president and Trump. He's endorsing inside of primaries and he's having a lot of
[2:08:20.820 --> 2:08:24.500]  Success and open priorities, but not so much success against
[2:08:24.980 --> 2:08:32.100]  Incumbents and so what's really interesting is how this and this wave is shaping up and we got data today that in 43 states
[2:08:32.100 --> 2:08:38.580]  1 million people have switched over to the Republican Party, whereas only 600,000 have switched over the Democrat Party
[2:08:39.220 --> 2:08:42.860]  Clearly, you know, where are these 81 million people? That's my question
[2:08:44.380 --> 2:08:46.380]  Well, you're not supposed to question
[2:08:47.580 --> 2:08:54.220]  Election integrity unless you're a Democrat. What is your handicapping or just far out prediction?
[2:08:54.500 --> 2:08:59.060]  134 days still pretty far out. What gut level? What do you think's about to go down with this midterm?
[2:08:59.060 --> 2:09:04.020]  I think they try to steal the whole thing from everybody again. They're already trying to outlaw the idea of questioning election fraud
[2:09:04.020 --> 2:09:06.780]  You know trying to put you and me in jail just for questioning it
[2:09:07.820 --> 2:09:11.940]  Just for questioning it. Look, I I don't know what I believe about the Senate
[2:09:11.940 --> 2:09:18.980]  I usually like make my Senate call in July or August. You can do it pretty much that early the house races, you know
[2:09:19.060 --> 2:09:22.060]  They can be really interesting. I remember in 2010
[2:09:22.140 --> 2:09:28.860]  We were watching races the night of that no one thought was competitive that we were pulling like 15 20 points
[2:09:28.860 --> 2:09:34.140]  Outside of we were winning those one of those races was in North Carolina Renee Elmer
[2:09:34.140 --> 2:09:38.940]  She was a nurse if you'll remember her she didn't had an alleged affair with Kevin McCarthy
[2:09:38.940 --> 2:09:45.940]  Which prevented him from becoming speaker, which is why Ryan Paul Ryan became speaker, you know, actually there
[2:09:46.900 --> 2:09:48.660]  You know after we took back the house
[2:09:48.660 --> 2:09:54.540]  So that was really interesting history and this is a little bit of the same where I actually believe that the Republican
[2:09:54.540 --> 2:10:02.100]  Establishment and Kevin McCarthy. They're trying to temper the red wave. I don't think that they want a hundred seats
[2:10:02.100 --> 2:10:04.460]  I don't think that they want 60 seats
[2:10:04.460 --> 2:10:10.500]  I think Kevin McCarthy wants, you know, 30 seats because then you can control the caucus
[2:10:10.500 --> 2:10:12.500]  But the more conservatives get elected
[2:10:12.980 --> 2:10:18.940]  The more subjective he is to actually the house Freedom Caucus and our friends like Paul Gosar
[2:10:18.940 --> 2:10:25.420]  MTG Andy Biggs and people who are really, you know fighting for the America first agenda
[2:10:25.420 --> 2:10:28.580]  So I actually think that Republicans are in on it. I tell our friends this
[2:10:28.660 --> 2:10:35.100]  Why is it Kevin McCarthy in front of a gas station every Friday every Monday doing the press conference?
[2:10:35.100 --> 2:10:41.700]  I mean, this is something that pierces to the suburban voter the people who voted against Republicans in 2018
[2:10:41.700 --> 2:10:46.180]  But voted for Republicans allegedly in 2020 but left Trump off their ballot
[2:10:46.180 --> 2:10:50.340]  I mean, it's a really strange voter that they're telling us exists. I don't believe they exist
[2:10:50.340 --> 2:10:56.980]  But if they existed why isn't Kevin McCarthy in front of the gas station, you know, so only there's no doubt that the Republican
[2:10:57.140 --> 2:11:00.660]  Establishment in the past managed power of the Democrats and that right now
[2:11:00.660 --> 2:11:06.780]  They're trying to head off the populist movement that put Trump in that could unseat them and they're very close if we get 30 40
[2:11:06.900 --> 2:11:11.020]  Had people like MTG or Gosar in its game over
[2:11:11.020 --> 2:11:17.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, but if we just get 30 40, you know neocons and a mix of rhinos, it'll be business as usual
[2:11:17.220 --> 2:11:21.900]  You're absolutely right. They want their personal power. They want to be in power 20 years from now as a speaker
[2:11:22.020 --> 2:11:23.700]  They're trying to manage all this
[2:11:23.700 --> 2:11:29.060]  But what they have to understand is the Democrats are trying to outlaw the Republican Party and have been demonizing them as well
[2:11:29.060 --> 2:11:32.220]  they need to stop being corporate lawyers and
[2:11:32.820 --> 2:11:34.660]  Running the country and into the ground
[2:11:34.660 --> 2:11:39.180]  They need to have a real revolution peacefully and take this country back, but you're absolutely right
[2:11:39.180 --> 2:11:41.580]  They should be trying to impeach Biden
[2:11:41.580 --> 2:11:47.500]  It doesn't matter that they don't have the votes the Democrats did that with Trump because it takes the political football away and
[2:11:47.500 --> 2:11:49.500]  makes it about open borders and
[2:11:50.140 --> 2:11:55.060]  Inflation and the rest of it instead they give the football the Democrats to have their January 6th show trial
[2:11:55.060 --> 2:11:59.820]  So it's a no-brainer to be having impeachment votes and impeachment hearings
[2:11:59.820 --> 2:12:07.540]  And it's it's a no-brainer because then it puts the focus massively back on Biden and how horribly is but no they're not doing that
[2:12:07.540 --> 2:12:12.340]  Are they? No, they're not and I was actually when I was in DC on Friday
[2:12:12.340 --> 2:12:17.540]  I was I was talking with a chief of staff and an ally of the America first agenda
[2:12:17.540 --> 2:12:23.540]  And I told him and conveyed to him that I support a fast impeachment of Joe Biden next year
[2:12:23.540 --> 2:12:28.380]  I don't support a long one. I support a fast one. So let's and let's impeach him for several things, right?
[2:12:28.380 --> 2:12:33.380]  It doesn't just have to be the border. It does need to include the due process abuses as you
[2:12:33.380 --> 2:12:40.340]  Articulated they're trying to outlaw the Republican Party and there's not enough conservative media focusing on this
[2:12:40.340 --> 2:12:42.340]  I mean think about this. They subpoenaed
[2:12:42.820 --> 2:12:48.740]  The top organizers the top activists in both the Tea Party and the election integrity movement in Michigan
[2:12:48.860 --> 2:12:56.140]  They've arrested the the leading gubernatorial candidate there against Gretchen Whitmore. They've rigged Michigan
[2:12:56.140 --> 2:13:00.140]  I've told people my first forecast of 2024 is that we've lost it
[2:13:00.140 --> 2:13:05.780]  We've officially lost it because they've shackled us down and we can't organize in Michigan
[2:13:05.780 --> 2:13:12.980]  My sources are telling me and some of the own the information that I'm getting from my lawyers is that Arizona and Georgia are next
[2:13:13.100 --> 2:13:15.100]  So they're actually stealing
[2:13:15.620 --> 2:13:21.980]  2024 two years ahead of time by doing what they've done to you and me for the past year and a half
[2:13:22.020 --> 2:13:28.420]  They're now spreading it out to about 50 or 60 different top activists in the states where we have to have
[2:13:28.420 --> 2:13:33.500]  complete organization peaceful protesting voter registration, you know
[2:13:33.500 --> 2:13:39.420]  Trump rallies and all of that and my fear is that Kevin McCarthy is actually in on it
[2:13:39.420 --> 2:13:41.420]  And so I favor a fast impeachment
[2:13:41.420 --> 2:13:45.460]  I favor a select committee to investigate this select committee
[2:13:45.460 --> 2:13:51.540]  I favor giving the oversight judiciary and how select committee a limited subpoena power and
[2:13:51.540 --> 2:13:59.260]  Kevin McCarthy needs to let them go. Jim Jordan, Jim Banks, Darrell Issa, they know what they're doing when they're managing these type of operations
[2:13:59.260 --> 2:14:02.140]  He needs to release an America first promise
[2:14:02.500 --> 2:14:09.700]  This summer and tell us what is the agenda for 2023 and I don't think that the establishment is ready to do that
[2:14:09.700 --> 2:14:15.860]  I think they're ready to do more of what we saw in the Senate where we had Republicans crossing over to outlaw guns
[2:14:15.900 --> 2:14:19.700]  While the Supreme Court is saying this is actually a fundamental right
[2:14:19.700 --> 2:14:26.780]  I mean, it's it's insane what we're seeing we're seeing the Hegelian dialectic management of the decline in real time
[2:14:27.140 --> 2:14:32.500]  But they've really taken off, you know, I don't know the facade of it all the Republicans are in on the game
[2:14:33.260 --> 2:14:37.620]  That's right. The establishment Republicans that want to be the functionaries want to keep their positions
[2:14:37.780 --> 2:14:41.140]  They are trying to manage the populist movement over the edge of a cliff
[2:14:42.180 --> 2:14:47.660]  When if the globalists continue down this road as you said this managed decline is it has a bottom
[2:14:47.660 --> 2:14:50.260]  It's gonna drop out and that's gonna destroy their own future
[2:14:50.260 --> 2:14:57.700]  But they were put in power because they follow orders by their corporate controllers and we know the Republicans have been bought off by big tech
[2:14:57.700 --> 2:15:01.820]  That's why they wouldn't stop the censorship and that's why Trump had the election stolen from him
[2:15:01.820 --> 2:15:04.380]  So they continue to purposely throw the fight
[2:15:05.740 --> 2:15:09.140]  It's it's absolutely right. I mean think about this if you are facing
[2:15:09.860 --> 2:15:11.340]  massive inflation
[2:15:11.340 --> 2:15:15.780]  massive gas prices food prices through the roof energy prices through the rails and
[2:15:15.780 --> 2:15:20.860]  A housing crisis that is in a complete bubble. Why would you send money to Ukraine?
[2:15:21.020 --> 2:15:24.980]  Except for they're in in on it. They are okay with the coming crash
[2:15:25.060 --> 2:15:29.340]  They think that they can set up another new deal and that's why they gave us
[2:15:29.860 --> 2:15:35.580]  Biden is that they want a new deal and they want Biden to usher that in and take the blame for any problems
[2:15:35.580 --> 2:15:41.980]  Absolutely, Ali Alexander is our guest. We've got a bunch of other analysis to do on other Supreme Court rulings that are coming up
[2:15:41.980 --> 2:15:47.220]  What's gonna happen in the aftermath of this Roe v. Wade being overturned? What's Trump's role?
[2:15:47.220 --> 2:15:51.020]  What's Ron DeSantis's role so many angles to cover with Ali Alexander?
[2:15:51.660 --> 2:15:53.660]  Analysis of 2022 and beyond straight ahead
[2:15:56.780 --> 2:16:02.540]  The best decisions new film 2000 mules is the most important documentary in modern times because it proves
[2:16:02.980 --> 2:16:09.660]  How the deep state stole a 2020 election and how they're planning to steal future elections and complete our journey to basically being like
[2:16:09.660 --> 2:16:13.660]  Venezuela now, it's great that it's online. It's great that millions watched online
[2:16:13.700 --> 2:16:19.100]  But you need to have the high quality HD DVD in your library with the expanded extras

[2:19:55.580 --> 2:20:10.860]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones
[2:20:25.580 --> 2:20:27.580]  You might like to dance
[2:20:28.580 --> 2:20:32.460]  You may be the heavyweight champion of the world
[2:20:33.420 --> 2:20:39.980]  You might be a socialite with a long-finger pulse, but you're gonna have to serve somebody
[2:20:41.420 --> 2:20:47.060]  Yes, I got a hundred questions for Ali Alexander because I knew him as a one of the most respected young
[2:20:47.460 --> 2:20:51.940]  Political analyst out there in the last ten years and I got to knowing not just on the show of the years
[2:20:51.940 --> 2:20:56.100]  But especially in the 2020 insanity and now obviously we're both
[2:20:56.380 --> 2:21:01.500]  Being persecuted together because we were there trying to stop people entering the Capitol and they still trying to put us in jail
[2:21:01.820 --> 2:21:06.420]  This is crazy and he was just in the grand jury and he's not ready to talk about that till Sunday
[2:21:06.540 --> 2:21:10.260]  But he told me quite a bit about it pretty amazing to say the least but
[2:21:13.340 --> 2:21:15.020]  I've got a thousand questions
[2:21:15.020 --> 2:21:18.420]  You've got a bunch of races to look at and and what's coming up in the midterms
[2:21:18.420 --> 2:21:24.340]  But then I got big questions for you or 35,000 foot questions about what do you make of the push for new lockdowns?
[2:21:24.340 --> 2:21:26.340]  What do you think's gonna happen with?
[2:21:26.420 --> 2:21:27.540]  these
[2:21:27.540 --> 2:21:32.100]  Pride parades that are basically pedophile pedophile events because I don't dislike gay people
[2:21:32.100 --> 2:21:34.860]  I don't dislike any of people that are adults and whatever
[2:21:34.860 --> 2:21:41.060]  But when they're bringing kids to things there's naked men running around the street. I mean, this is pedophilic. What are the Democrats thinking?
[2:21:41.060 --> 2:21:45.460]  Why are they going so nuts? I want to get your take on that as well. I want to get your take on Trump the Santas
[2:21:46.060 --> 2:21:47.580]  all of it but
[2:21:47.580 --> 2:21:49.380]  Roe v. Wade ruling
[2:21:49.380 --> 2:21:54.300]  You got to give Trump credit. I know you're a big supporter. I'm a big supporter would upset about the vaccine the rest of it
[2:21:54.300 --> 2:22:01.180]  But Donald Trump's supreme legacy is he said I'll overturn it. He did it. He gets a lot of the credit
[2:22:01.180 --> 2:22:07.860]  I mean that is you judge a tree by its fruits and that right there is the biggest W win for Trump in my view
[2:22:07.860 --> 2:22:09.860]  What do you say Ali Alexander? I
[2:22:10.380 --> 2:22:15.020]  Agree, you know when I when I was in high school and I thought I was a Democrat
[2:22:15.020 --> 2:22:19.420]  I thought I was a conservative Democrat and my debate coach said no, I think you're Republican
[2:22:19.420 --> 2:22:25.660]  Why did you spend this spring break doing some research and I I came back from three spring break and I said, you know
[2:22:25.660 --> 2:22:27.180]  Oh my gosh, I'm a Republican
[2:22:27.180 --> 2:22:31.180]  I think I'm a conservative Republican and she just laughed because you know
[2:22:31.180 --> 2:22:37.580]  She knew my values and knew that that was about accurate and I remember in that that my top issue was life
[2:22:37.900 --> 2:22:41.820]  That that life exceeded politics. It wasn't even a question
[2:22:41.820 --> 2:22:48.860]  I I wondered why people could justify abortion. You never find a child who thinks abortion is natural
[2:22:49.340 --> 2:22:53.420]  And so for me, this is a day. I never thought right. We all thought for this day
[2:22:53.820 --> 2:22:56.300]  But none of us thought it was going to actually happen
[2:22:56.700 --> 2:23:00.060]  And and I thought that it would never happen. So to watch the court
[2:23:01.100 --> 2:23:07.180]  overturn a poorly written decision with poor logic and poor science and poor reasoning
[2:23:07.180 --> 2:23:12.780]  Uh that derives from a butchered understanding the 14th amendment that's really for black people
[2:23:12.940 --> 2:23:18.380]  But it's become a shopping cart for for the progressive left and the Marxist left and the Bolshevik left
[2:23:18.860 --> 2:23:21.420]  Um, it really restores some of your faith
[2:23:22.060 --> 2:23:26.380]  In the system that if you want abortion, you're going to have to pass it at the state level
[2:23:26.620 --> 2:23:29.660]  Or if you want something else, you're going to have to pass it at the congressional level
[2:23:29.820 --> 2:23:35.100]  Why have Democrats never passed abortion at the federal level because it's never been popular
[2:23:35.100 --> 2:23:40.220]  Because they've always had to trick the public, you know, because there's only so much of the country that's liberal
[2:23:40.460 --> 2:23:45.020]  And then they need those moderate Democrats or those conservative Democrats to get any type of majority
[2:23:45.340 --> 2:23:51.260]  So, I mean what we're seeing is an accurate portrayal of the country and I applaud this court and I applaud Donald Trump
[2:23:51.580 --> 2:23:57.420]  He is the man that god anointed for this position. We got three justices on the court that held the line
[2:23:57.660 --> 2:24:03.420]  We can see that chief justice roberts was actually the mistake and you know, god will give you what you need not what you
[2:24:03.420 --> 2:24:07.420]  You know what and I credit the president trump for crediting god
[2:24:07.900 --> 2:24:11.660]  And then saying that this is due to um decades of answers of prayer
[2:24:11.980 --> 2:24:16.380]  And so I think that this is trump lining himself to frankly run better
[2:24:16.940 --> 2:24:20.860]  Uh, then he ran in 2016 and he'll align those metaphysical forces
[2:24:21.340 --> 2:24:25.100]  Uh, you know in his favor because we're going to really be up against it
[2:24:25.100 --> 2:24:28.620]  So huge shout out to this court and I want to point this out, alec
[2:24:28.620 --> 2:24:35.740]  The court had a string of christian victories not republican victories. These are deeply christian victories
[2:24:36.060 --> 2:24:38.060]  And so whether it's the religious funding
[2:24:38.620 --> 2:24:43.980]  The case out of main or whether it's the the football coach who was praying at the 50 yard line
[2:24:44.140 --> 2:24:49.020]  After games and the school district came down hard on him or it's overturning roe and kasey
[2:24:49.420 --> 2:24:54.300]  With this dob's decision a huge shout out to the christians who stood alone
[2:24:54.300 --> 2:24:59.340]  Who didn't have republican party backing and simply just said i'm gonna do the right thing
[2:24:59.500 --> 2:25:04.220]  And I think that this is a testament of our time, you know, we look at the election integrity issue
[2:25:04.300 --> 2:25:08.300]  It's an 85 issue alec's and we led the way in a very peaceful way
[2:25:08.700 --> 2:25:12.620]  You know 500 rallies across the country all without a police report
[2:25:13.180 --> 2:25:19.900]  And and yet, you know, you can't find that in conservative media that's propped up by facebook or youtube or subsidized
[2:25:19.900 --> 2:25:24.060]  You know by seeing in and so um, and let's expand on that holly
[2:25:24.780 --> 2:25:26.780]  Let's expand on that
[2:25:27.180 --> 2:25:32.780]  These these victories for free speech all these victories are just further enraging the left
[2:25:33.180 --> 2:25:38.620]  What do you expect them to do next in in the face of this and why do you think the court suddenly?
[2:25:39.180 --> 2:25:44.380]  After these years of really not doing the right thing suddenly is maybe it's the left threatening them more
[2:25:44.700 --> 2:25:47.100]  Maybe it's seeing the accelerated decline of the country
[2:25:47.100 --> 2:25:51.420]  Well, you know alec's i'm gonna say something crazy, but I you know, this is my kind of
[2:25:51.900 --> 2:25:57.740]  Four-dimensional analysis of the issue is that um, we are watching the implosion of our country
[2:25:58.300 --> 2:26:02.860]  And you can never and you and I have talked about this especially on your air about
[2:26:03.500 --> 2:26:05.500]  Inversion well
[2:26:05.740 --> 2:26:06.860]  This is implosion
[2:26:06.860 --> 2:26:09.340]  They're gonna give us some of what we want
[2:26:09.660 --> 2:26:15.580]  In order to make the left irate and then they're gonna give the left some of what they want in order to make us
[2:26:15.580 --> 2:26:23.180]  In order to make us irate. Okay, so that's two dimensions where you get four dimensions is then you add the inversion
[2:26:23.420 --> 2:26:24.940]  So for example
[2:26:24.940 --> 2:26:32.220]  They give them drag your kids to pride in dallas where you know taylor hansen came and we you know
[2:26:32.220 --> 2:26:36.220]  He came on clubhouse and I interviewed him and he told me things that you know
[2:26:36.220 --> 2:26:40.860]  The conservative media didn't even report that that there was alcohol served from 11 to 2
[2:26:40.860 --> 2:26:46.060]  Uh p.m. That there were children at the bar that there were children crying that there wasn't just that sign that said if you
[2:26:47.100 --> 2:26:51.180]  Uh, uh, you lick it you know, there was a sign said something about licking it
[2:26:51.180 --> 2:26:54.380]  But there was another sign said if you lick it you own it so I mean
[2:26:55.020 --> 2:26:58.300]  So that's a way of making us irate the row decision
[2:26:58.780 --> 2:27:05.100]  Is the way of making them irate but the inversion is to make sure that liberals are illiberal
[2:27:05.100 --> 2:27:12.460]  And the inversion on our side is to turn the military against itself through the force vaccination
[2:27:12.460 --> 2:27:16.940]  So you can really see that our country is facing an existential crisis
[2:27:17.580 --> 2:27:21.420]  And they're convinced the globalist that we won't be able to solve it
[2:27:21.740 --> 2:27:29.260]  So i'm not sure that either through a supernatural spiritual dark force or through globalist temporal planning
[2:27:29.980 --> 2:27:31.580]  We are being
[2:27:31.580 --> 2:27:36.940]  Demolished this is a controlled demolition in four different aspects in a quadrant type
[2:27:37.660 --> 2:27:40.620]  Aspect and so that's what I really think truthfully is happening
[2:27:41.500 --> 2:27:44.140]  Well, I I agree that that's what satan wants to do
[2:27:44.620 --> 2:27:49.580]  But we're bringing real activism and a real awakening of the table that has forced them into this position
[2:27:49.580 --> 2:27:53.420]  So they're going to try to have a collapse which they can pose as a savior's over
[2:27:53.820 --> 2:27:56.300]  But I believe that's going to blow up in their face and in the end
[2:27:56.700 --> 2:27:59.100]  Uh, this is going to be a big defeat for the new world order
[2:27:59.100 --> 2:28:03.260]  So take a long time, but I believe ollie we are starting to hit bottom
[2:28:05.820 --> 2:28:11.980]  Yeah, I think so and I and I want to say that miracles happen and miracles happen when gods people are obedient
[2:28:12.140 --> 2:28:17.420]  You know and we turn away from some of that stupid stuff that we've been doing and so I've done that in my life
[2:28:17.420 --> 2:28:20.300]  I hope other people are doing that in their life and we should prepare away
[2:28:20.860 --> 2:28:27.260]  For a miracle because frankly, that's what we're going to need if we're going to take the country back in 2022 and 2024
[2:28:27.260 --> 2:28:31.500]  And we're going to have to hold the republicans accountable to our conservative principle
[2:28:32.140 --> 2:28:35.500]  Well, I'll tell you this if they're parading kids with neck and men through the streets
[2:28:37.020 --> 2:28:41.500]  Of major cities, what will they be doing in a year? They'll be having sex with them on tv
[2:28:42.860 --> 2:28:44.780]  heaven forbid

[2:34:30.800 --> 2:34:33.840]  But with inflation and the problems and all the things that came in
[2:34:34.320 --> 2:34:36.320]  We brought in several outside
[2:34:36.560 --> 2:34:41.440]  Accounting firms and had them do projections and analysis with the things that are going on
[2:34:41.440 --> 2:34:49.600]  And they finally got back with the numbers last week if we weren't given nine million dollars in bitcoin donations two months ago
[2:34:50.480 --> 2:34:54.800]  Which i dumped half of it. Thank god and got it at like 40 39 dollars
[2:34:55.600 --> 2:34:59.840]  Kept back the rest and then lost two million of it. So nine million became seven million
[2:35:01.120 --> 2:35:03.120]  If we hadn't been given
[2:35:03.680 --> 2:35:05.680]  That donation
[2:35:05.680 --> 2:35:10.800]  I've already sold almost everything i've got i could sell my cars everything it wouldn't run us for a month
[2:35:11.440 --> 2:35:13.440]  Whoever did that and i don't know who you are
[2:35:14.560 --> 2:35:16.560]  Whoever did that
[2:35:18.160 --> 2:35:22.800]  You saved info wars at least for this is foreseeable for five months
[2:35:23.920 --> 2:35:27.920]  That said we took two million dollars of the money which it turned out we didn't
[2:35:28.400 --> 2:35:29.760]  We made the order last week
[2:35:29.760 --> 2:35:34.240]  We didn't have money to buy the product because the supply chain breakdowns that happened previously
[2:35:34.240 --> 2:35:37.920]  We didn't get enough product in to make the quote of what we had to sell
[2:35:38.560 --> 2:35:44.320]  So we got the jam we got new awesome manufacturers bunch of products have been out for over eight nine months
[2:35:44.320 --> 2:35:47.680]  I'll be back in looks like in about a month dna force you name it
[2:35:48.320 --> 2:35:50.320]  And that'll pull us out of this
[2:35:50.640 --> 2:35:54.560]  But we it was worse. I was telling you we had a two three million dollar underage
[2:35:55.280 --> 2:35:59.600]  We had a six million dollar underage and I have hard
[2:36:00.720 --> 2:36:02.720]  hard accounting on this now
[2:36:02.720 --> 2:36:05.840]  And it's insane it literally the exact amount of money
[2:36:05.840 --> 2:36:13.840]  We needed to pay off the previous bills get up the speed and then order enough product to project out to be barely in the black through this year
[2:36:15.600 --> 2:36:17.600]  It happens so thank you whoever you are
[2:36:18.160 --> 2:36:22.720]  But all the little donations and all the product purchases without you wouldn't be here either so whether you bought
[2:36:23.440 --> 2:36:24.960]  a tube of toothpaste

[2:36:36.560 --> 2:36:38.080]  And so that's why we're having a problem

[2:36:40.560 --> 2:36:43.760]  And with whatever products we've got left a lot of the great products are still there
[2:36:43.760 --> 2:36:47.440]  But we're running out of those having to offer them at sell price to move them. So

[2:37:21.120 --> 2:37:26.960]  Like ollie alexander who they've basically threatened to put in jail for no reason for helping organize
[2:37:27.280 --> 2:37:31.280]  The stop the steal and stand up for all of our rights. He's been in front of the committee
[2:37:31.680 --> 2:37:34.000]  I took the fifth because I mean I know how dangerous they are
[2:37:34.560 --> 2:37:37.680]  He had the wavos to go on the lines did and do it to face Goliath
[2:37:37.840 --> 2:37:39.840]  He went in front of the grand jury
[2:37:39.840 --> 2:37:43.760]  And he told the truth despite all the persecution put his ass on the line
[2:37:43.760 --> 2:37:51.680]  So everybody should support this man. Give sin go dot com forward slash ollie alexander
[2:37:51.760 --> 2:37:54.160]  Proven battle hard. You don't know who somebody is. So you're in the trenches with him
[2:37:54.160 --> 2:37:58.880]  I've been in this the trenches with this guy for two years at least so ollie continuing
[2:37:59.280 --> 2:38:03.280]  Everybody wants to talk about this. So do I I'm very torn. I love DeSantis
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:11.440]  He's really done an amazing job so eloquent so smart so untarget way ahead of trump on the vaccine issue trump gets the
[2:38:11.440 --> 2:38:16.800]  Super touchdown in sudden death overtime with he pledged to do with roe v. Wade
[2:38:16.960 --> 2:38:23.760]  I am really in a paradox here of not knowing who I want to back. I think that'll materialize as time goes on
[2:38:23.760 --> 2:38:27.200]  I know trump isn't getting to run. I can tell you folks. He is running. He'll announce within them
[2:38:27.280 --> 2:38:32.640]  You know probably six months to a year. I probably have to midterms the word is so ollie with all your inside baseball
[2:38:32.640 --> 2:38:34.640]  What do you think's going on here with those two?
[2:38:34.640 --> 2:38:41.120]  Yeah, it is really interesting because uh DeSantis is clearly keeping his options open
[2:38:41.760 --> 2:38:43.760]  You know when someone polling is high
[2:38:44.080 --> 2:38:49.280]  In in his approval rating within the GOP as trump, which you know, I have to remind people
[2:38:49.840 --> 2:38:56.720]  Is the most high that any republican nominee any democrat nominee or any president has pulled with his in within his own party
[2:38:57.120 --> 2:39:02.560]  Is president trump trump has reshaped some of the political science in the modern era
[2:39:02.560 --> 2:39:06.000]  And that's why you know when I'm when I'm talking about the stolen election
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:07.280]  I'm like look
[2:39:07.280 --> 2:39:12.240]  You see on tv link and project what you have to understand is that they are the smallest dissenting force
[2:39:12.720 --> 2:39:18.960]  That any nominee or any president has ever faced period. So where did the magic voters come from?
[2:39:19.200 --> 2:39:22.320]  especially if trump increased his votes with gays
[2:39:22.960 --> 2:39:24.960]  muslims blacks
[2:39:25.040 --> 2:39:26.320]  Hispanic
[2:39:26.320 --> 2:39:29.680]  And we supposedly then lost white men give me a break
[2:39:29.680 --> 2:39:34.560]  But I don't want to revisit 2020 as much as I want to say is I want to relitigate
[2:39:35.040 --> 2:39:37.760]  Uh 2020 in 2024
[2:39:38.080 --> 2:39:44.800]  I want the american people to see with their own eyes that the democrats could not ever possibly get 81 million
[2:39:45.040 --> 2:39:51.280]  They couldn't get 71 million if they wanted. Okay, they made up so many votes in my opinion that uh
[2:39:51.680 --> 2:39:54.400]  That you know, it needs the fraud needs to be exposed
[2:39:54.480 --> 2:39:58.960]  But you know what I think is dark and nefarious is again again again
[2:39:58.960 --> 2:40:00.960]  There's an implosionary
[2:40:01.040 --> 2:40:07.040]  In in inversion happening within our party the deep state is trying to lock up all the trump support
[2:40:07.680 --> 2:40:13.120]  Uh uh criminally indict trump or put, you know, the air of misdeed around him
[2:40:14.080 --> 2:40:19.440]  Have legal challenges to his name on the ballot and select states and then say well conservatives
[2:40:19.680 --> 2:40:24.160]  Why don't you choose to santa's so, you know, I love what governor de santa's is doing
[2:40:24.160 --> 2:40:31.200]  After all I did stop the seal in 2018 to protect his seat and rick scott's seat. Unfortunately. We lost the ag
[2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:33.600]  commissioner race there
[2:40:33.600 --> 2:40:37.440]  Um, but but at the end of the day, you know, I got to support trump
[2:40:37.760 --> 2:40:44.320]  But the great thing about this pressure right that's building behind de santa's is that it makes trump a better candidate
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:50.000]  So, you know, I I'm I too am in this paradox where you know, I'm kind of cheering for both
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:56.080]  But, you know, if if the election if the primary election was held today, you know, I'd vote for trump trump would win
[2:40:56.400 --> 2:41:01.280]  But de santa's is making trump a better candidate. Ali. Alexander. That is the most perfect analysis. I've heard
[2:41:01.680 --> 2:41:05.760]  De santa's keeps trump young makes you more hardcore populist
[2:41:06.400 --> 2:41:11.360]  Keeps him true to the populist message because the media is like this is a trump message that's winning. No, it's a populist
[2:41:11.920 --> 2:41:17.120]  Tea party pro america christian message that trump adopted the santa's as well
[2:41:17.120 --> 2:41:22.000]  Uh, and I admire both men. I think both men are good man. They both made mistakes. Somebody's perfect
[2:41:22.320 --> 2:41:26.480]  But you're absolutely right. We got to dance with a guy that brung us and I think you just convinced me
[2:41:27.040 --> 2:41:30.880]  Because even last week I'm like, maybe it's the santa's now. I think trump just edged ahead
[2:41:31.360 --> 2:41:34.240]  And I think de santa's will keep trump honest
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:41.040]  Yeah, and you know, I have a couple swing issues, you know, de santa's got better on the j6
[2:41:41.520 --> 2:41:46.000]  Victims, especially those guys who are still locked up there. Um, you know, whatever
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:51.280]  Um, if de santa's, you know, or trump gets worse on the vaccine issue, then, you know, whatever
[2:41:51.280 --> 2:41:56.320]  So there's a lot of wiggle room and I will say, you know, the polling is starting to shift
[2:41:56.720 --> 2:42:02.880]  So donald trump has to do something to again, like you said adopt this populist message that since 2008
[2:42:02.880 --> 2:42:05.680]  We have been crying for we say we don't want to moderate
[2:42:06.080 --> 2:42:08.000]  We want this to be a christian nation
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:13.600]  We want this to be a conservative nation where your locality governs you and that you can have community standards
[2:42:13.600 --> 2:42:18.640]  If you want to be a little liberal or a little conservative, especially because we've seen the liberals want to conquer everything
[2:42:18.880 --> 2:42:21.440]  And put the most radical pedophiles and satanists in charge
[2:42:21.600 --> 2:42:24.480]  They don't want to live in peace with us. They want to conquer us
[2:42:24.480 --> 2:42:27.520]  They're not a party that wants to work with people they want to outlaw us
[2:42:27.760 --> 2:42:32.720]  So we've got to culturally and politically non-violently annihilate them
[2:42:32.880 --> 2:42:36.560]  We have to extinct the democratic party because they're trying to extinct america
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:41.040]  Yep, we got to make liberalism great again by defeating them
[2:42:41.040 --> 2:42:43.760]  Ali, what do you want to hit in the final segment straight ahead?
[2:42:45.200 --> 2:42:49.600]  I think uh, you know, maybe we should talk about well, I don't know. What should we talk about?
[2:42:49.600 --> 2:42:54.240]  I got a hundred things to talk about. Don't worry. I got a lot of questions for you. You're kicking butt. My friend will be right back
[2:42:56.560 --> 2:43:03.680]  Ladies and gentlemen in the last 30 months, we've witnessed the globalist hit humanity and hit humanity extremely hard
[2:43:04.400 --> 2:43:09.120]  It is beyond critical that everyone listening to the sound of my voice

[2:44:01.840 --> 2:44:03.840]  of the planet's ruling class
[2:44:03.840 --> 2:44:09.040]  Not in communist china, not in mexico, not in the united states, not anywhere
[2:44:09.760 --> 2:44:14.320]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:20.400]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[2:44:21.280 --> 2:44:23.920]  that look into say the anglo-american establishment
[2:44:24.400 --> 2:44:30.160]  The founder of the bill berg group the trilateral commission the united nations the whole project of the ross calls of the rock folks
[2:44:31.040 --> 2:44:33.040]  until 10 years ago the media said
[2:44:33.040 --> 2:44:36.080]  The control corporate media the bill berg group didn't exist
[2:44:36.800 --> 2:44:39.440]  Well, now the bill berg group is public in its former head
[2:44:40.080 --> 2:44:41.520]  He's still on the steering committee
[2:44:41.520 --> 2:44:45.360]  It's called schwaab and he has set up the great reset at global government
[2:44:45.840 --> 2:44:49.840]  And if as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on
[2:44:50.560 --> 2:44:55.520]  About the fact that you're a worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover. We don't have a shot. We do expose them
[2:44:55.520 --> 2:44:59.920]  We should beat a measly cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left
[2:44:59.920 --> 2:45:04.240]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept
[2:45:04.480 --> 2:45:08.720]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition
[2:45:08.880 --> 2:45:13.040]  Buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store.com

[2:45:34.960 --> 2:45:41.040]  Can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells

[2:47:16.960 --> 2:47:21.360]  In fact things are so insane. It kind of feels weird to just be up here
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:24.000]  Calmly talking about this
[2:47:24.560 --> 2:47:27.760]  I mean, they're getting false flags ready. I didn't even cover this
[2:47:28.320 --> 2:47:31.440]  I'll actually cover this after ollie leaves us and then hand the baton to
[2:47:32.160 --> 2:47:34.160]  Cheryl salante that's coming up, but
[2:47:34.560 --> 2:47:36.560]  We talk about news and information overload
[2:47:37.600 --> 2:47:40.480]  project veritas caught democrat party operatives
[2:47:40.480 --> 2:47:46.480]  Talking about infiltrating the republican party to then commit crimes and blame them
[2:47:50.080 --> 2:47:51.920]  I mean
[2:47:51.920 --> 2:47:53.920]  ladies and gentlemen
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:56.000]  They talk about sleeper cells
[2:47:56.800 --> 2:47:58.960]  This has been going on a long time ladies and gentlemen
[2:47:59.920 --> 2:48:02.320]  You don't really think those white supremacist groups running around
[2:48:02.960 --> 2:48:04.960]  Polling out of the back of u-haul trucks
[2:48:05.360 --> 2:48:07.360]  Are real right?
[2:48:07.360 --> 2:48:12.240]  I mean, I'm sorry. It's just unbelievable
[2:48:12.640 --> 2:48:15.440]  Uh ollie alexander on your radar screen
[2:48:16.800 --> 2:48:20.400]  How can the deep state grab victory from the jaws of defeat?
[2:48:20.640 --> 2:48:22.560]  What's the rabbit they're gonna try to pull out of their hat?
[2:48:22.720 --> 2:48:24.720]  I see all the pre-programming as you said to
[2:48:25.280 --> 2:48:27.520]  label all of their opposition illegal
[2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:29.600]  We you and I first started saying that a year and a half ago
[2:48:29.840 --> 2:48:34.240]  Sir Carlson, rightfully has you know realized that and picked it up some republicans are getting it
[2:48:34.240 --> 2:48:40.000]  I mean the democrats really are saying now they went out while the republican party because they know they've lost the hearts and minds
[2:48:40.240 --> 2:48:43.920]  So all they've got selection fraud and a civil emergency or a war
[2:48:44.560 --> 2:48:49.440]  Uh, I mean it's just insane that biden could snap his fingers and turn on the keystone pipeline
[2:48:49.760 --> 2:48:54.640]  And lift the restrictions on drilling and in about three months prices would go back down to close to trump
[2:48:54.800 --> 2:49:00.720]  But he won't do it and he says oh, it's a transition. So it's just crazy how they have their foot on our neck
[2:49:00.720 --> 2:49:06.160]  And obviously there's gonna be a giant landslide all the former liberals. I knew almost all of them are now
[2:49:06.640 --> 2:49:08.640]  rabid populist totally awake
[2:49:09.120 --> 2:49:13.360]  I mean, this is a total political realignment in my view a fourth turning's already happened
[2:49:13.600 --> 2:49:16.640]  And I don't think their great research is gonna gonna convince people
[2:49:18.480 --> 2:49:23.360]  Yeah, you know, it's it's really interesting because you know in my reading of history
[2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:29.840]  We're stuck in like you said this cyclical. I actually think that we're seeing in the end of recycles
[2:49:29.840 --> 2:49:35.440]  Okay, so we're probably at the end of a hundred year cycle a 500 year cycle and then potentially, you know
[2:49:35.600 --> 2:49:38.400]  The big one perfectly. We're in the end of a super cycle
[2:49:39.600 --> 2:49:41.360]  Yeah, and
[2:49:41.360 --> 2:49:44.800]  But the irony of it is that we're tortured by
[2:49:45.680 --> 2:49:47.520]  retarded oligarchs
[2:49:47.520 --> 2:49:51.520]  So in a lot of ways they have the plan from their predecessors
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:58.800]  You know and they use the star charts and they use these secret symbols and and and and they're very aware of when they need to do things
[2:49:58.800 --> 2:50:02.240]  But but in as much as they've done us down
[2:50:02.720 --> 2:50:08.080]  They themselves have done themselves down and that's why you see the oligarchs are now hunter biden
[2:50:08.240 --> 2:50:10.880]  You know of all people and mit romney and you know
[2:50:10.880 --> 2:50:16.480]  These are these are not the oligarchs that we should be afraid of we're more afraid that they're actually going to mess things up
[2:50:16.720 --> 2:50:20.720]  And accidentally genocide all of us and so it seems to me
[2:50:21.440 --> 2:50:25.520]  That you know is that god's way of making an opening for us
[2:50:25.520 --> 2:50:30.720]  You know that that we the spiritual people are the ones that are defending
[2:50:31.840 --> 2:50:36.240]  Conscious and and consent and reason. You know these things that
[2:50:37.520 --> 2:50:42.320]  And survival a good clean civilization is a good thing. It's makes you secure and prosperous
[2:50:43.600 --> 2:50:48.800]  It's true. You know and yeah, we're the champions of science, you know, they're the champions of scientism
[2:50:48.880 --> 2:50:51.440]  So, you know in a lot of ways, you know, I
[2:50:51.440 --> 2:50:56.720]  I don't know what's happening, but it is surreal. I was talking to a publisher last night and I said
[2:50:56.960 --> 2:51:02.880]  I would call this period american surrealism, you know, because you know, no one's going to believe this in 50 years
[2:51:02.960 --> 2:51:08.400]  If we survive no one's gonna believe what we went through with the names of people were, you know, supreme court justice
[2:51:08.480 --> 2:51:11.920]  That said she couldn't she wasn't a biologist or she couldn't affirm that she was a woman
[2:51:12.160 --> 2:51:14.320]  But she was appointed that position because she was a woman
[2:51:14.560 --> 2:51:19.520]  They're considering row v way because women, you know, it's just it's just very very surreal
[2:51:19.520 --> 2:51:23.920]  I think what we're going through and I think that's part of their game though to make us crazy
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:28.080]  And so that's always I'm always telling people drink water work out
[2:51:28.720 --> 2:51:34.480]  Supplements and pray, you know, that's that's how you get the base before you even start reading or consuming any of this
[2:51:35.040 --> 2:51:38.960]  I mean, I mean my my family told me that about six months ago. I was working 15 hours a day
[2:51:39.040 --> 2:51:42.880]  They said son, you know this better than I but you got to drink water. You got to exercise
[2:51:42.960 --> 2:51:47.200]  You got to take supplements. You tell everybody this you got to go have some fun and you're gonna go crazy
[2:51:47.200 --> 2:51:52.400]  And now I'm feeling a lot better doing great lost 30 something pounds. I'm still fat because I just realized hey
[2:51:52.480 --> 2:51:54.240]  You can't beat this alone
[2:51:54.240 --> 2:51:56.960]  Give it to god fight as hard as you can, but just give it to god
[2:51:57.040 --> 2:51:57.920]  We got
[2:51:57.920 --> 2:52:00.160]  Like and I'm not perfect ollie yesterday
[2:52:00.160 --> 2:52:06.640]  I was so upset watching pedophile marches around the country that I really literally was choking on air
[2:52:06.880 --> 2:52:09.760]  It's because but but when you hit that wall, you just got to
[2:52:10.560 --> 2:52:13.600]  Go to the quiet place the most tired of king david talked about and just give it to god
[2:52:13.600 --> 2:52:19.280]  It's so true and I'll say that, you know when we spoke briefly yesterday. You sounded
[2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  Um, you know full of fight and full of joy
[2:52:22.720 --> 2:52:24.720]  Uh for the first time in months
[2:52:25.280 --> 2:52:30.320]  And uh, I had a friend uh comment last night when I was on the phone with her and she said, you know
[2:52:30.480 --> 2:52:33.680]  It's so good to hear that you have your spirit back because for four weeks
[2:52:33.760 --> 2:52:39.120]  I've been dreading this grand jury gate that I did on friday and it was affecting my breathing patterns
[2:52:39.120 --> 2:52:44.000]  It was affecting just how I approached everything and and finally it was like god was saying it was okay
[2:52:44.320 --> 2:52:46.800]  And then my flight was delayed six times
[2:52:47.120 --> 2:52:51.920]  Which allowed me enough time to go to the supreme court and just walk amongst the liberals
[2:52:52.400 --> 2:52:56.640]  And it was just it was fascinating because here's what's not being reported on the news
[2:52:56.880 --> 2:52:58.880]  There are fewer protesters
[2:52:59.600 --> 2:53:06.720]  Uh outside the supreme court on the on the decision day then there were in may when the leak actually happened
[2:53:06.720 --> 2:53:11.600]  So what's funny is the democrats are losing momentum. They're losing steam. They're falling apart and you're right
[2:53:11.600 --> 2:53:16.320]  I felt good yesterday when we talked and then I hadn't seen all the footage and I came in here and watched an hour of it
[2:53:16.640 --> 2:53:22.320]  And got depressed. How do you cope with that? Like looking at the abyss that Nietzsche talked about and not becoming the abyss
[2:53:23.600 --> 2:53:28.240]  Yeah, well like we just we we just alluded to look we are souls in this temporal body
[2:53:28.720 --> 2:53:33.200]  And we do have to take care of this temporal body because it affects our perspective, you know how we align
[2:53:33.200 --> 2:53:37.840]  You know with god's will and the universe and so and and I'm bad at that too, you know, you know
[2:53:38.240 --> 2:53:42.480]  You've got you're you're you're across the barrier like I don't drink enough water. I don't work out
[2:53:42.560 --> 2:53:46.560]  I don't eat enough and so, you know, it's taking care of that physical body
[2:53:46.880 --> 2:53:52.160]  It's surrounding yourself by people who can mean it and encouraging in the word and people, you know
[2:53:52.240 --> 2:53:54.480]  Other christians who will tell you despair is a sin
[2:53:54.880 --> 2:53:59.920]  You know, you can be sad but you're not allowed to despair or if you have something to offer the world
[2:53:59.920 --> 2:54:07.280]  If god has given you a gift or a talent you owe it to him to to be in the fight and and you can't become the monster
[2:54:07.360 --> 2:54:11.520]  So in the same ways that I don't want to cringe they remain peaceful remain peaceful
[2:54:11.920 --> 2:54:17.040]  I still owe it if that's my true statement to occasionally say that um, but to not step off the gas
[2:54:17.120 --> 2:54:20.160]  I was really it was really great during the break, you know
[2:54:20.640 --> 2:54:27.200]  To hear 1776 or you know, what was said in the travesty letter victory or death. We're just quoting historical document
[2:54:27.200 --> 2:54:32.560]  We're not calling for violence. We're saying find that spirit within you that enrages against
[2:54:32.960 --> 2:54:39.840]  Immorality and what is wrong and what will hurt the poor and women and widows the most and fight like hell
[2:54:40.320 --> 2:54:45.440]  In the way that we've agreed to and that's definitely what they're scared of you and trump and to sanis and everybody
[2:54:45.680 --> 2:54:50.960]  And myself and all these listeners is we have the spirit of victory. We have the antidote to their poison
[2:54:51.200 --> 2:54:54.080]  I mean, I go to a conservative rally or I go it can be black white
[2:54:54.080 --> 2:55:00.720]  People look healthy their eyes are shining you go to a leftist event. They look like some kind of demons suck their soul out
[2:55:01.040 --> 2:55:03.040]  I mean, it's scary
[2:55:03.040 --> 2:55:07.520]  It's it's it literally is night and day you if you haven't protested in your life
[2:55:07.600 --> 2:55:13.120]  And I know a lot of people uh in uh, the post-election of 2020 that was some of their first protesting
[2:55:13.440 --> 2:55:17.680]  Uh, but you have to go out and just observe this, you know outside the supreme court
[2:55:17.840 --> 2:55:20.080]  There was a gentleman just playing music, you know
[2:55:20.080 --> 2:55:24.800]  He looked like he was in his 60s and he had a table and he's playing music and he was just he was just like
[2:55:25.040 --> 2:55:26.800]  You know dropping the funk
[2:55:26.800 --> 2:55:31.920]  And these women came and they just shrieked and yelled and these young guys came and they shrieked and they yelled
[2:55:32.160 --> 2:55:35.280]  And you could tell all of them were on the spectrum, you know, no offense
[2:55:35.360 --> 2:55:41.600]  There's a lot of people on the spectrum now, but all of them were on the spectrum and they really were trying to imitate
[2:55:42.400 --> 2:55:47.440]  Violent, you know, it was very bizarre and he's just smiling and every time they were to attack him
[2:55:47.440 --> 2:55:53.040]  The u.s. Capitol police would come over and get them away from him and it never worked the other way
[2:55:53.040 --> 2:55:59.040]  You'll never see a pro lifer attack a pro abortionist, you know outside the supreme court
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:01.600]  It's always the other way and I just I thought
[2:56:02.560 --> 2:56:06.800]  We are looking at the people who say they're pro science pro reason pro tolerance
[2:56:07.280 --> 2:56:13.200]  Be antithetical to all those things. They've been demonically possessed and this is because you know, this is
[2:56:13.200 --> 2:56:16.480]  Oh as Luciferian as it is Bolshevik as it is
[2:56:17.280 --> 2:56:21.360]  Marxist as it is democrat and they they need to implode the country
[2:56:21.360 --> 2:56:26.000]  But I don't I do I have I have a lot of hope that we're going to stop them our joy
[2:56:26.320 --> 2:56:32.000]  Our laughter our reason our patience will win out the day, you know, the gifts of the spirit
[2:56:32.480 --> 2:56:37.200]  Will beat anything, you know on this that's why they don't want us to talk about it because they know it's the answer
[2:56:37.200 --> 2:56:40.560]  Ali Alexander, everybody can find you. Where's the best place?

[3:01:27.200 --> 3:01:31.200]  I'm very much in a lot of ways, but I don't know how to turn it off and turn it on
[3:01:33.200 --> 3:01:39.200]  You know, I I know how to I know how to be in certain spaces, you know, you got to be able to turn it off and turn it on
[3:01:39.200 --> 3:01:41.200]  So
[3:01:41.360 --> 3:01:48.320]  Like we literally like this is this is how you this is the only way you're going to take the dynamics in South Carolina
[3:01:49.280 --> 3:01:51.280]  You got to find some folks that
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:54.080]  Are a little bit polished
[3:01:54.080 --> 3:02:00.800]  Maybe are not, you know, nobody really knows them that well. Maybe they haven't really been politically active
[3:02:01.760 --> 3:02:03.760]  But we need some secret sleepers
[3:02:03.760 --> 3:02:08.240]  Like we need we need them to run as the other side even though they for our side
[3:02:09.280 --> 3:02:11.280]  And we need to win
[3:02:12.400 --> 3:02:19.520]  Because that's how like I mean we can we can battle them in public all day as long as we know we're working for the same goal
[3:02:19.520 --> 3:02:24.480]  You know, I tell my colleagues up here all the time. I'm going to be that every day of the week
[3:02:24.880 --> 3:02:28.560]  have too many people that that ain't enough ain't out for us and
[3:02:29.120 --> 3:02:33.920]  Look like this me, but honestly these ain't the same type of black people that I grew up around
[3:02:34.320 --> 3:02:36.640]  I don't recognize these like that. So
[3:02:39.280 --> 3:02:43.760]  Black because I don't understand the type of black that they are now. Can I talk intelligently?
[3:02:43.840 --> 3:02:46.960]  Can I I could be listening I can move in all kind of circles
[3:02:46.960 --> 3:02:53.440]  But I'm a little hard. I love black people. I feel safe if you're around my feet. So for me
[3:02:54.720 --> 3:02:58.640]  I feel like y'all we need sleepers, but we need a group of sleepers
[3:02:59.200 --> 3:03:04.080]  We need some folks that ain't that we need some folks that team wear all black at night and take their
[3:03:04.720 --> 3:03:06.720]  Yard signs down when they when they sleeping
[3:03:07.200 --> 3:03:09.040]  The same they do with us
[3:03:09.040 --> 3:03:12.160]  Just the other way, you know, I'm saying we ain't gotta make a question
[3:03:12.160 --> 3:03:19.280]  All right, that's enough of it. We gotta go live about it. Well, she thinks she thinks that she's invented all of this
[3:03:19.360 --> 3:03:21.360]  It's called Dan Crenshaw
[3:03:22.160 --> 3:03:28.320]  You you didn't invent sleeper cell sweetheart. It's called Kevin McCarthy. It's called Mitt Romney
[3:03:30.000 --> 3:03:32.000]  It's called George W. Bush
[3:03:32.800 --> 3:03:36.000]  We need democrat globalist opposes republicans and ron
[3:03:37.520 --> 3:03:39.920]  That's exactly what's been going on forever and then
[3:03:39.920 --> 3:03:44.880]  They want to use drug money. They go on to say to control this and look, I don't know, you know
[3:03:45.680 --> 3:03:50.160]  I don't know if Crenshaw's stupid or he's a sellout. I don't want to attack the guy. I've invited him on the show
[3:03:51.920 --> 3:03:54.640]  You know, he reached out to a well-known talk show host whenever I
[3:03:55.200 --> 3:03:59.040]  Talked about him being a debos and I'm a numb lion a numb a numb lie
[3:03:59.760 --> 3:04:01.440]  alumni and
[3:04:01.440 --> 3:04:06.400]  He's on there. He said it isn't true. I said come on the show. I'd love to have Crenshaw on but the point is
[3:04:06.400 --> 3:04:12.960]  You have to go up their voting records and that means you actually have to go look up their voting record for yourself. Okay
[3:04:14.640 --> 3:04:16.640]  I want to say wonderful job to the crew

[3:05:11.680 --> 3:05:17.840]  Screw you over especially the big firms and the big tax groups because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public
[3:05:17.840 --> 3:05:24.400]  Understanding this and knowing this show. It's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody

[3:06:22.080 --> 3:06:25.280]  Hey great being on the alex john show and
[3:06:26.640 --> 3:06:30.800]  Yeah, the election was stolen. Oh freedom has been stolen
[3:06:32.080 --> 3:06:37.040]  And this country has gone down physically emotionally and spiritually
[3:06:37.760 --> 3:06:40.240]  In ways that you know just beyond the belief
[3:06:40.240 --> 3:06:44.000]  And of course now the big issue is
[3:06:44.640 --> 3:06:47.760]  Roe vs. Wade and I'm not going to take a side on it
[3:06:48.400 --> 3:06:51.120]  I'm just going to look at it for what it is and what's going on
[3:06:52.880 --> 3:06:56.160]  Number one, they're going to say that the democrats are going to use this
[3:06:57.360 --> 3:07:03.680]  And it's going to help them win the midterm elections and I want to make this 100 clear
[3:07:03.680 --> 3:07:10.640]  I don't want the democrats to win the midterm election and I want to make it
[3:07:11.440 --> 3:07:16.080]  100 clear. I don't want the repulsive kins
[3:07:16.880 --> 3:07:23.040]  Women winning the midterm election. They're both to me a crime syndicate
[3:07:23.600 --> 3:07:27.040]  By their deeds you shall know them
[3:07:27.040 --> 3:07:33.280]  How many more wars these low life pieces of scum have to start
[3:07:33.840 --> 3:07:39.680]  How much more of our money that I have to steal to give to the too big to fails
[3:07:40.320 --> 3:07:46.000]  Yeah, how could you be so stupid to look up to a clown like McConnell?
[3:07:46.000 --> 3:07:51.520]  Well, maybe you want to bend over for Lindsey Graham. Yeah, he liked that
[3:07:52.240 --> 3:07:55.760]  That little clown there's not a war that he hasn't pushed for
[3:07:55.760 --> 3:08:03.280]  One after another, little boys that couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag
[3:08:03.760 --> 3:08:07.120]  And how much more of our money that they have to steal
[3:08:08.560 --> 3:08:17.600]  In the name of too big to fail. Hey, hey, so empty. I'm Jamie Dimon. Do you know who I am?
[3:08:18.480 --> 3:08:24.560]  Yeah, my bank and all the others were going out of toilet, but they pumped 29 trillion
[3:08:24.560 --> 3:08:32.480]  into the system between 2007 to 2010
[3:08:33.280 --> 3:08:38.960]  To give me more dough and only my bank has only been convicted of five felonies
[3:08:39.280 --> 3:08:43.520]  But you're just a piece of crap. We'll lock you up for anything
[3:08:43.840 --> 3:08:51.120]  But hey, I'll stay on top because the repulsive gins and demo craps. I bought them all out
[3:08:51.120 --> 3:08:56.480]  Oh, just like that clown show going on over there in Illinois
[3:08:57.920 --> 3:09:03.040]  Oh, yeah, you got a senator's or governor's race and a guy Pritzker
[3:09:03.760 --> 3:09:10.400]  That could throw an S in there too for it. Oh my daddy and my my family. Oh, we own Hyatt
[3:09:11.040 --> 3:09:16.640]  Hyatt hotel. We got a lot of dough and that other guy Griffin dumping in billions
[3:09:16.640 --> 3:09:20.320]  The whole game is rigged
[3:09:21.920 --> 3:09:24.160]  So going back to Roe versus Wade
[3:09:25.920 --> 3:09:29.840]  And what's going on and the hypocrisy of the government
[3:09:36.000 --> 3:09:40.640]  Where these people these are the biggest libtards out there
[3:09:40.640 --> 3:09:45.680]  They're protesting my body my choice
[3:09:47.520 --> 3:09:50.000]  Okay, fine. Hey

[3:10:54.320 --> 3:10:58.960]  That they pushed into the system to sell the Vax
[3:10:58.960 --> 3:11:06.720]  Two million dollars. Hey, plan parenthood. What about my body my choice?

[3:11:37.600 --> 3:11:39.600]  anyway

[3:11:45.440 --> 3:11:48.160]  Said quote the u.s. Supreme Court's decision to oververt
[3:11:48.560 --> 3:11:51.920]  Roe vs. Wade ends federal protections for abortion
[3:11:52.320 --> 3:11:54.320]  diminishes human rights
[3:11:54.320 --> 3:11:57.760]  Hey Soros, how about my human rights?

[3:12:19.600 --> 3:12:21.600]  What hypocrisy?
[3:12:21.600 --> 3:12:23.600]  What hypocrisy?

[3:14:13.520 --> 3:14:15.520]  and are tired of it
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:22.000]  And don't want to be told what to do with our bodies. You're all a bunch of low life

[3:14:55.760 --> 3:15:00.320]  Denouncing rovers way my body my choice
[3:15:00.320 --> 3:15:09.360]  As you have no choice to take a vaccine that you keep promoting all over the world
[3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:13.680]  Get this in your head everybody
[3:15:15.920 --> 3:15:18.800]  Mentally ill people are controlling the world
[3:15:20.320 --> 3:15:23.680]  This is bigger than big. It's demonic
[3:15:25.200 --> 3:15:27.200]  Satanic
[3:15:27.200 --> 3:15:31.360]  Evil and cruel. Oh, yeah
[3:15:32.560 --> 3:15:36.080]  Rights of a newborn but no rights to me. Hey
[3:15:36.960 --> 3:15:42.080]  You're just a little italian from the Bronx. You grew up in a bra. You're a nobody. Hey
[3:15:42.640 --> 3:15:48.320]  No, you know, my daddy was my daddy was George Bush. No, no, my daddy was true dope. Yeah
[3:15:48.320 --> 3:15:56.320]  It's one big show and you ain't in it. So stay in it and support him for wars
[3:15:58.320 --> 3:16:04.320]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean this is from people say why is it from Chiapas, Mexico the communist?
[3:16:04.320 --> 3:16:12.320]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil better than watermelon coffee
[3:16:12.320 --> 3:16:16.320]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that you know the media calls communist, but really they're just a commune
[3:16:16.320 --> 3:16:22.320]  And whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over
[3:16:22.320 --> 3:16:26.320]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up
[3:16:26.320 --> 3:16:32.320]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more for pound and I just think it's some of the best coffee
[3:16:32.320 --> 3:16:36.320]  You're gonna find anywhere. It's wake up America patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally
[3:16:36.320 --> 3:16:40.320]  Um, in fact, I'm gonna tell you a little story
[3:16:40.320 --> 3:16:42.320]  Um
[3:16:42.320 --> 3:16:47.320]  We had like that. Okay, you wouldn't believe it. Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com
[3:16:47.320 --> 3:16:51.320]  And that's how we fund this operation and if you don't find us and don't want to share that's fine
[3:16:55.320 --> 3:17:02.320]  At this point best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all
[3:17:02.320 --> 3:17:06.320]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse

[3:20:19.320 --> 3:20:21.320]  The Alex Jones Show
[3:20:21.320 --> 3:20:26.320]  And now your host Gerald Salente
[3:20:27.320 --> 3:20:29.320]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show
[3:20:29.320 --> 3:20:31.320]  This is what Alex just said
[3:20:31.320 --> 3:20:32.320]  This town
[3:20:32.320 --> 3:20:33.320]  The inflation is going to go
[3:20:33.320 --> 3:20:35.320]  It's much going to get much worse
[3:20:35.320 --> 3:20:37.320]  And so get these products now
[3:20:37.320 --> 3:20:39.320]  He's 100% correct
[3:20:39.320 --> 3:20:44.320]  We are in a period of life unimaginable
[3:20:44.320 --> 3:20:48.320]  I've been in the trend forecasting business 42 years
[3:20:48.320 --> 3:20:50.320]  42 years
[3:20:50.320 --> 3:20:52.320]  That's when I began it
[3:20:52.320 --> 3:20:55.320]  I've never seen anything like this
[3:20:55.320 --> 3:20:58.320]  The whole situation
[3:20:58.320 --> 3:21:01.320]  That's been created
[3:21:01.320 --> 3:21:04.320]  Is done by mentally ill people
[3:21:04.320 --> 3:21:06.320]  They call politicians, polytics
[3:21:06.320 --> 3:21:08.320]  Many ticks
[3:21:08.320 --> 3:21:10.320]  That suck the life out of your body
[3:21:10.320 --> 3:21:13.320]  So they could get everything that they want
[3:21:13.320 --> 3:21:16.320]  The inflation that they caused
[3:21:16.320 --> 3:21:18.320]  Is very clear in front of everybody's eyes
[3:21:18.320 --> 3:21:21.320]  Since the panic of 08
[3:21:21.320 --> 3:21:23.320]  When they started pumping all this cheap money
[3:21:23.320 --> 3:21:26.320]  Into the system and artificially hyping it up
[3:21:26.320 --> 3:21:29.320]  And as John Williams Shadow Stat shows
[3:21:29.320 --> 3:21:31.320]  The inflation numbers are double or more
[3:21:31.320 --> 3:21:33.320]  Than what they actually are
[3:21:33.320 --> 3:21:35.320]  Well, the housing prices only went up
[3:21:35.320 --> 3:21:38.320]  Like 20% a year for the last couple of years
[3:21:38.320 --> 3:21:40.320]  No, that's not inflation
[3:21:40.320 --> 3:21:42.320]  We don't put that in there
[3:21:42.320 --> 3:21:44.320]  Oh, the price of steak went up
[3:21:44.320 --> 3:21:46.320]  People are eating chopped meat now
[3:21:46.320 --> 3:21:48.320]  So we're not going to put that in there
[3:21:48.320 --> 3:21:50.320]  This is actually what they've done
[3:21:50.320 --> 3:21:52.320]  And worse than that
[3:21:52.320 --> 3:21:55.320]  So listen to what Alex said
[3:21:55.320 --> 3:21:57.320]  Get these products now
[3:21:57.320 --> 3:22:00.320]  You're getting them for three major reasons
[3:22:00.320 --> 3:22:04.320]  Reason number one is yourself
[3:22:04.320 --> 3:22:07.320]  Reason number two
[3:22:07.320 --> 3:22:10.320]  To keep the truth alive and stay on
[3:22:10.320 --> 3:22:12.320]  By keeping info wars out there
[3:22:12.320 --> 3:22:14.320]  Because the guests today bring on
[3:22:14.320 --> 3:22:16.320]  The hard work that the people do there
[3:22:16.320 --> 3:22:19.320]  And how Alex puts his neck on the line
[3:22:19.320 --> 3:22:21.320]  Like, woof
[3:22:21.320 --> 3:22:23.320]  You want to do everything you can to support the truth
[3:22:23.320 --> 3:22:26.320]  Because they're robbing it from us day by day
[3:22:26.320 --> 3:22:29.320]  And number three goes back to inflation
[3:22:29.320 --> 3:22:32.320]  You'll save a lot of dough by doing it now
[3:22:32.320 --> 3:22:35.320]  So anyway, go to infowarsstores.com
[3:22:35.320 --> 3:22:37.320]  And get what you can get
[3:22:37.320 --> 3:22:40.320]  I was talking about the hypocrisy
[3:22:40.320 --> 3:22:43.320]  Of these anti-abortion people
[3:22:43.320 --> 3:22:46.320]  These are the biggest proponents
[3:22:46.320 --> 3:22:49.320]  Of forcing us
[3:22:49.320 --> 3:22:53.320]  Like that slime ball gates
[3:22:53.320 --> 3:22:56.320]  The vax king of the world
[3:22:56.320 --> 3:22:58.320]  What a hypocrite little boy
[3:22:58.320 --> 3:23:01.320]  And again, when you look at the gates
[3:23:01.320 --> 3:23:03.320]  And you look at the Zuckerbergs
[3:23:03.320 --> 3:23:06.320]  And you look at the cooks and the peach eyes
[3:23:06.320 --> 3:23:09.320]  These are the geek freaks that have taken over
[3:23:09.320 --> 3:23:12.320]  Human spirit, that's right
[3:23:12.320 --> 3:23:14.320]  One after another
[3:23:14.320 --> 3:23:17.320]  Little boys of nothing
[3:23:17.320 --> 3:23:21.320]  Little cowardly boys
[3:23:21.320 --> 3:23:23.320]  The geek world
[3:23:23.320 --> 3:23:26.320]  They took the spirit out of life
[3:23:26.320 --> 3:23:28.320]  They did it with music
[3:23:28.320 --> 3:23:30.320]  Oh no, we can digitize it
[3:23:30.320 --> 3:23:32.320]  It's just as good
[3:23:32.320 --> 3:23:34.320]  Yeah, Count Basie, Duke Ellington
[3:23:34.320 --> 3:23:37.320]  No, forget them
[3:23:37.320 --> 3:23:39.320]  That's domino
[3:23:39.320 --> 3:23:41.320]  No, no, no, no, I forget that
[3:23:41.320 --> 3:23:44.320]  No, no, no, forget all this
[3:23:44.320 --> 3:23:46.320]  We got digital now
[3:23:46.320 --> 3:23:48.320]  And one bad rap
[3:23:48.320 --> 3:23:50.320]  This country's gone down
[3:23:50.320 --> 3:23:52.320]  Physically, emotionally and spiritually
[3:23:52.320 --> 3:23:53.320]  Like I said
[3:23:53.320 --> 3:23:55.320]  And the geeks brought it down
[3:23:55.320 --> 3:23:57.320]  The hardest and the fastest to make
[3:23:57.320 --> 3:23:58.320]  Along with the banksters
[3:23:58.320 --> 3:23:59.320]  What they all have been doing now
[3:23:59.320 --> 3:24:00.320]  Well, you have to do this
[3:24:00.320 --> 3:24:02.320]  You remember what happened to Jesus Christ
[3:24:02.320 --> 3:24:05.320]  Three days after he drove them out of the temple
[3:24:05.320 --> 3:24:07.320]  It's on the cross
[3:24:07.320 --> 3:24:09.320]  Nailed to it
[3:24:09.320 --> 3:24:12.320]  Going back to the hypocrisy
[3:24:12.320 --> 3:24:16.320]  So they had yesterday
[3:24:16.320 --> 3:24:19.320]  Reuters headline today
[3:24:19.320 --> 3:24:21.320]  Pride parades march on
[3:24:21.320 --> 3:24:25.320]  With new urgency across U.S.
[3:24:25.320 --> 3:24:27.320]  Number one, be who you want to be
[3:24:27.320 --> 3:24:29.320]  I don't care, it's your trip
[3:24:29.320 --> 3:24:31.320]  You know, if you're proud of it, that's okay
[3:24:31.320 --> 3:24:33.320]  I'm proud of who I am
[3:24:33.320 --> 3:24:35.320]  I don't talk about it
[3:24:35.320 --> 3:24:36.320]  Be whatever you want to be
[3:24:36.320 --> 3:24:37.320]  Do whatever you want to do
[3:24:37.320 --> 3:24:39.320]  This is America
[3:24:39.320 --> 3:24:41.320]  But pride parades march on
[3:24:41.320 --> 3:24:46.320]  With new urgency across U.S.
[3:24:46.320 --> 3:24:48.320]  It's too bad
[3:24:48.320 --> 3:24:56.320]  There is no peace in their pride march
[3:24:56.320 --> 3:25:00.320]  As the United States sends
[3:25:00.320 --> 3:25:05.320]  Billions of dollars of weaponry
[3:25:05.320 --> 3:25:09.320]  To keep bloodying the killing fields of Ukraine
[3:25:09.320 --> 3:25:11.320]  Have no pride in that
[3:25:11.320 --> 3:25:13.320]  No pride in peace
[3:25:13.320 --> 3:25:21.320]  Nope, hey, if, if, if, if
[3:25:21.320 --> 3:25:27.320]  The pride folks
[3:25:27.320 --> 3:25:31.320]  Be pro-abortion
[3:25:31.320 --> 3:25:34.320]  My body, my choice folks
[3:25:34.320 --> 3:25:36.320]  United for peace
[3:25:36.320 --> 3:25:39.320]  Day, then it would be news
[3:25:39.320 --> 3:25:42.320]  Day, then, now we're talking
[3:25:42.320 --> 3:25:45.320]  Big news, big news, big news
[3:25:45.320 --> 3:25:47.320]  Now hear this
[3:25:47.320 --> 3:25:49.320]  I'm a little Jake Kapper up there, you know what?
[3:25:49.320 --> 3:25:52.320]  I'm a little, uh, uh
[3:25:52.320 --> 3:25:53.320]  What's that called?
[3:25:53.320 --> 3:25:55.320]  Anderson Cooper
[3:25:55.320 --> 3:25:57.320]  Mommy's girl, no, mommy's girl
[3:25:57.320 --> 3:25:58.320]  Mommy's boy, I forgot
[3:25:58.320 --> 3:26:01.320]  Gloria Vanderbilt's son, yeah
[3:26:01.320 --> 3:26:03.320]  Oh, you would all be promoting
[3:26:03.320 --> 3:26:07.320]  If it was a pride peace march
[3:26:07.320 --> 3:26:12.320]  And a, a, a Planned Parenthood peace march
[3:26:12.320 --> 3:26:13.320]  No, then it would be news
[3:26:13.320 --> 3:26:16.320]  But hey, Salenty's having a rally
[3:26:16.320 --> 3:26:19.320]  With Judge Napolitano
[3:26:19.320 --> 3:26:21.320]  Scott Ritter, Gary Null
[3:26:21.320 --> 3:26:23.320]  And others, hot damn Ben
[3:26:23.320 --> 3:26:25.320]  Having a free party come
[3:26:25.320 --> 3:26:26.320]  You know, you buy what you already want
[3:26:26.320 --> 3:26:29.320]  From the vendors
[3:26:29.320 --> 3:26:32.320]  For peace and freedom
[3:26:32.320 --> 3:26:35.320]  The true American spirit
[3:26:35.320 --> 3:26:37.320]  No foreign entanglements
[3:26:37.320 --> 3:26:38.320]  Oh, George Washington
[3:26:38.320 --> 3:26:40.320]  Oh, you're gonna listen to George Washington
[3:26:40.320 --> 3:26:41.320]  He was a slave
[3:26:41.320 --> 3:26:43.320]  Hey, yeah, take it easy
[3:26:43.320 --> 3:26:44.320]  Of course the Delaware, right?
[3:26:44.320 --> 3:26:46.320]  Went in fight, not like these little boys
[3:26:46.320 --> 3:26:47.320]  Like Obama
[3:26:47.320 --> 3:26:49.320]  I want that guy a son out of there
[3:26:49.320 --> 3:26:51.320]  I want that guy, uh
[3:26:51.320 --> 3:26:53.320]  Gaddafi, yeah, no, I'm not gonna go take him out
[3:26:53.320 --> 3:26:55.320]  You go take him out
[3:26:55.320 --> 3:26:57.320]  Yeah, I can't fight my way out of a paper bag
[3:26:57.320 --> 3:26:59.320]  But boy, do I know how to talk arrogantly
[3:26:59.320 --> 3:27:04.320]  And have stupid people follow what I tell them
[3:27:04.320 --> 3:27:08.320]  Yeah, those people
[3:27:08.320 --> 3:27:10.320]  It'll all be bragging
[3:27:10.320 --> 3:27:12.320]  All be bragging
[3:27:12.320 --> 3:27:19.320]  If it was a pride peace parade
[3:27:19.320 --> 3:27:25.320]  Or a Planned Parenthood peace parade
[3:27:25.320 --> 3:27:30.320]  But a true American spirit
[3:27:30.320 --> 3:27:35.320]  Selenty rally for occupied peace
[3:27:35.320 --> 3:27:37.320]  And united
[3:27:37.320 --> 3:27:40.320]  Though the universal church of freedom, peace and justice
[3:27:40.320 --> 3:27:42.320]  Nah, that's not news
[3:27:42.320 --> 3:27:44.320]  We don't want peace
[3:27:44.320 --> 3:27:46.320]  We're prostitutes
[3:27:46.320 --> 3:27:48.320]  We sell war
[3:27:48.320 --> 3:27:53.320]  We sell war
[3:27:53.320 --> 3:27:54.320]  Hypocrisy
[3:27:54.320 --> 3:27:56.320]  Right in front of our eyes
[3:27:56.320 --> 3:27:59.320]  So going back to where I was gonna begin at
[3:27:59.320 --> 3:28:00.320]  What you're looking at
[3:28:00.320 --> 3:28:02.320]  Is this going to be an issue
[3:28:02.320 --> 3:28:03.320]  When I started
[3:28:03.320 --> 3:28:05.320]  On the midterm elections?
[3:28:05.320 --> 3:28:07.320]  No, no
[3:28:07.320 --> 3:28:08.320]  It may be
[3:28:08.320 --> 3:28:10.320]  But a small one
[3:28:10.320 --> 3:28:12.320]  It's the economy's stupid
[3:28:12.320 --> 3:28:15.320]  That was the phrase that the Clinton administration
[3:28:15.320 --> 3:28:17.320]  Used in 1992
[3:28:17.320 --> 3:28:19.320]  That's all the people really care about
[3:28:19.320 --> 3:28:20.320]  Are their pocketbooks
[3:28:20.320 --> 3:28:22.320]  That's going to decide this
[3:28:22.320 --> 3:28:24.320]  Yeah, they may be something that comes up
[3:28:24.320 --> 3:28:25.320]  And they draw a false flag
[3:28:25.320 --> 3:28:27.320]  That changes the deal
[3:28:27.320 --> 3:28:29.320]  And puts it back on to this
[3:28:29.320 --> 3:28:31.320]  It's the economy's stupid
[3:28:31.320 --> 3:28:33.320]  And remember
[3:28:33.320 --> 3:28:36.320]  Inflation is a part of that stupid
[3:28:36.320 --> 3:28:38.320]  So do you can now to buy these products
[3:28:38.320 --> 3:28:41.320]  From InfowarsStores.com

[3:28:45.320 --> 3:28:47.320]  And you're gonna do everything you need
[3:28:47.320 --> 3:28:48.320]  To protect yourself
[3:28:48.320 --> 3:28:50.320]  In these rough times ahead

[3:29:20.320 --> 3:29:22.320]  You and your fellow Americans choose
[3:29:22.320 --> 3:29:24.320]  The new film, the seminal film
[3:29:24.320 --> 3:29:26.320]  The most important documentary ever made
[3:29:26.320 --> 3:29:27.320]  In my view
[3:29:27.320 --> 3:29:29.320]  2000 mules is now available
[3:29:29.320 --> 3:29:31.320]  On DVD with expanded extras
[3:29:31.320 --> 3:29:35.320]  At infowarsstore.com

[3:29:47.320 --> 3:29:49.320]  If they're planning to run the same scams again
[3:29:49.320 --> 3:29:51.320]  This film can stop them if you take action
[3:29:51.320 --> 3:29:53.320]  Infowarsstore.com
[3:29:53.320 --> 3:29:55.320]  2000 mules
[3:29:55.320 --> 3:29:57.320]  Look at that
[3:29:57.320 --> 3:29:59.320]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear
[3:29:59.320 --> 3:30:00.320]  That's because it's been denatured
[3:30:00.320 --> 3:30:01.320]  It's been worked out
[3:30:01.320 --> 3:30:03.320]  We didn't do that
[3:30:03.320 --> 3:30:05.320]  You think I would metaphysically
[3:30:05.320 --> 3:30:08.320]  Tell you something that is the very best I can get
[3:30:08.320 --> 3:30:10.320]  I'd rather go to hell and do that
[3:30:10.320 --> 3:30:13.320]  I will only give you the maximum best info
[3:30:13.320 --> 3:30:16.320]  The maximum truth, the maximum product
[3:30:16.320 --> 3:30:19.320]  Because I want that good will
[3:30:19.320 --> 3:30:21.320]  What I do to you, I do to myself
[3:30:21.320 --> 3:30:23.320]  Don't you get the big secret?
[3:30:23.320 --> 3:30:25.320]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[3:30:25.320 --> 3:30:27.320]  No, you never seen that have you
[3:30:27.320 --> 3:30:29.320]  And this little jewel right here
[3:30:29.320 --> 3:30:31.320]  Is solid
[3:30:33.320 --> 3:30:35.320]  Liquid consciousness
[3:30:38.320 --> 3:30:39.320]  Look it up
[3:30:39.320 --> 3:30:41.320]  Find out
[3:30:42.320 --> 3:30:44.320]  How even the FDA and the government
[3:30:44.320 --> 3:30:46.320]  Admits fish oil is incredible
[3:30:46.320 --> 3:30:48.320]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves
[3:30:48.320 --> 3:30:51.320]  Is take good fish oil or krill oil
[3:30:51.320 --> 3:30:53.320]  Just like our information is dynamite

[3:31:19.320 --> 3:31:21.320]  I told you over two years ago
[3:31:21.320 --> 3:31:23.320]  The globe was going to have massive inflation
[3:31:23.320 --> 3:31:25.320]  And food shortages and it's happened
[3:31:25.320 --> 3:31:27.320]  Just like clockwork
[3:31:27.320 --> 3:31:29.320]  And I'm telling you it's going to get a lot worse
[3:31:29.320 --> 3:31:31.320]  They have designed this
[3:31:31.320 --> 3:31:33.320]  The way to beat them is to buy food now

[3:31:54.320 --> 3:32:23.320]  Take action
[3:32:24.320 --> 3:32:26.320]  The Bilderberg Group founded Davos Group
[3:32:26.320 --> 3:32:28.320]  So now
[3:32:28.320 --> 3:32:30.320]  The fight's out in the open
[3:32:30.320 --> 3:32:31.320]  They're making their move
[3:32:31.320 --> 3:32:33.320]  Because they know they're behind schedule
[3:32:33.320 --> 3:32:34.320]  We're going to win this thing
[3:32:34.320 --> 3:32:36.320]  God's watching the children counting on us
[3:32:36.320 --> 3:32:38.320]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners
[3:32:38.320 --> 3:32:39.320]  For your word of mouth

[3:32:41.320 --> 3:32:42.320]  Because without you
[3:32:42.320 --> 3:32:43.320]  Info Wars would not be here
[3:32:43.320 --> 3:32:45.320]  I just want you to really internalize
[3:32:45.320 --> 3:32:47.320]  The fact that you are the Info War
[3:32:47.320 --> 3:32:48.320]  And you are the reason
[3:32:48.320 --> 3:32:50.320]  Humanity has a fighting chance
[3:32:50.320 --> 3:32:51.320]  So I want to thank you
[3:32:51.320 --> 3:32:53.320]  And salute you again for all you've done
[3:32:53.320 --> 3:32:55.320]  And I ask you now to redouble your efforts
[3:33:23.320 --> 3:33:25.320]  The frontal assault on the lies
[3:33:25.320 --> 3:33:27.320]  Of the New World Order
[3:33:27.320 --> 3:33:29.320]  It's Alex Jones
[3:33:29.320 --> 3:33:31.320]  And now your host
[3:33:31.320 --> 3:33:35.320]  Gerald Salente
[3:33:35.320 --> 3:33:37.320]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show
[3:33:37.320 --> 3:33:38.320]  In Info Wars
[3:33:38.320 --> 3:33:39.320]  And again
[3:33:39.320 --> 3:33:41.320]  The only thing you can to support Info Wars
[3:33:41.320 --> 3:33:42.320]  The future's in your hands
[3:33:42.320 --> 3:33:44.320]  Don't drop it
[3:33:44.320 --> 3:33:45.320]  Because they're censoring us
[3:33:45.320 --> 3:33:46.320]  All over the place
[3:33:46.320 --> 3:33:47.320]  Again
[3:33:47.320 --> 3:33:49.320]  Going back to the hypocrisy
[3:33:49.320 --> 3:33:50.320]  Of Planned Parenthood
[3:33:50.320 --> 3:33:52.320]  The vaccine champions
[3:33:52.320 --> 3:33:53.320]  And my body
[3:33:53.320 --> 3:33:55.320]  My choice of hypocrites
[3:33:55.320 --> 3:33:56.320]  You know
[3:33:56.320 --> 3:33:58.320]  If you say anything that
[3:33:58.320 --> 3:34:00.320]  You know, you didn't want to get the vax
[3:34:00.320 --> 3:34:01.320]  Or you didn't believe in it
[3:34:01.320 --> 3:34:03.320]  Because of different reasons
[3:34:03.320 --> 3:34:04.320]  You were censored
[3:34:04.320 --> 3:34:07.320]  And still are
[3:34:07.320 --> 3:34:08.320]  And so
[3:34:08.320 --> 3:34:10.320]  That this has happened in this country
[3:34:10.320 --> 3:34:12.320]  Is heartbreaking to me
[3:34:12.320 --> 3:34:14.320]  And that's why I'm doing everything
[3:34:14.320 --> 3:34:15.320]  To support Info Wars
[3:34:15.320 --> 3:34:17.320]  And you can too
[3:34:17.320 --> 3:34:18.320]  And again
[3:34:18.320 --> 3:34:19.320]  If you want to see history
[3:34:19.320 --> 3:34:20.320]  Before it happens
[3:34:20.320 --> 3:34:22.320]  Everything's going on in the economy now
[3:34:22.320 --> 3:34:23.320]  You know
[3:34:23.320 --> 3:34:25.320]  We had forecast this inflation
[3:34:25.320 --> 3:34:27.320]  Almost two years ago
[3:34:27.320 --> 3:34:28.320]  And giving the data
[3:34:28.320 --> 3:34:29.320]  Why it was happening
[3:34:29.320 --> 3:34:30.320]  While the Federal Reserve
[3:34:30.320 --> 3:34:32.320]  The Fed had Powell
[3:34:32.320 --> 3:34:33.320]  And Janet Yellen
[3:34:33.320 --> 3:34:35.320]  Screaming that it was only temporary
[3:34:35.320 --> 3:34:37.320]  And transitory
[3:34:37.320 --> 3:34:38.320]  Or transgendatory
[3:34:38.320 --> 3:34:39.320]  It'd be proper
[3:34:39.320 --> 3:34:40.320]  You know
[3:34:40.320 --> 3:34:41.320]  It's just a bunch of BS
[3:34:41.320 --> 3:34:42.320]  So transjournal.com
[3:34:42.320 --> 3:34:43.320]  The magazine
[3:34:43.320 --> 3:34:46.320]  Averages about 160 pages a week
[3:34:46.320 --> 3:34:47.320]  You read what you want
[3:34:47.320 --> 3:34:48.320]  No ads
[3:34:48.320 --> 3:34:49.320]  There's a real magazine
[3:34:49.320 --> 3:34:50.320]  Telling you what the world is going on
[3:34:50.320 --> 3:34:51.320]  What it means
[3:34:51.320 --> 3:34:52.320]  What's next
[3:34:52.320 --> 3:34:53.320]  What to do
[3:34:53.320 --> 3:34:54.320]  And the model
[3:34:54.320 --> 3:34:55.320]  Of course being
[3:34:55.320 --> 3:34:56.320]  Think for yourself
[3:34:56.320 --> 3:34:57.320]  And
[3:34:57.320 --> 3:34:59.320]  As the brilliant covers by Anthony Freight
[3:34:59.320 --> 3:35:00.320]  Of the current one
[3:35:00.320 --> 3:35:01.320]  You know
[3:35:01.320 --> 3:35:03.320]  A picture of the White House
[3:35:03.320 --> 3:35:04.320]  With a fence around
[3:35:04.320 --> 3:35:06.320]  It's a mental institution
[3:35:06.320 --> 3:35:07.320]  I mean
[3:35:07.320 --> 3:35:08.320]  How much more proof do you need
[3:35:08.320 --> 3:35:09.320]  How stupid can you be
[3:35:09.320 --> 3:35:10.320]  To believe this
[3:35:10.320 --> 3:35:12.320]  Gobbage that the mainstream floods out
[3:35:12.320 --> 3:35:14.320]  And speaking of which
[3:35:14.320 --> 3:35:15.320]  A big promoter's a war
[3:35:15.320 --> 3:35:16.320]  If there hasn't been a war
[3:35:16.320 --> 3:35:17.320]  They never loved
[3:35:17.320 --> 3:35:18.320]  Remember the main
[3:35:18.320 --> 3:35:20.320]  Oh, that was the Hearst Foundation
[3:35:20.320 --> 3:35:23.320]  How about the Gulf of Tonkin incident
[3:35:23.320 --> 3:35:24.320]  That never happened
[3:35:24.320 --> 3:35:25.320]  That they saw us
[3:35:25.320 --> 3:35:27.320]  That McNamara lighted us into that
[3:35:27.320 --> 3:35:28.320]  Oh, that's okay
[3:35:28.320 --> 3:35:29.320]  The media did it
[3:35:29.320 --> 3:35:30.320]  How about Saddam Hussein
[3:35:30.320 --> 3:35:31.320]  Has weapons of mass destruction
[3:35:31.320 --> 3:35:32.320]  And ties to that
[3:35:32.320 --> 3:35:33.320]  Okay, it doesn't matter
[3:35:33.320 --> 3:35:34.320]  If it's true or false
[3:35:34.320 --> 3:35:35.320]  Remember the New York Times
[3:35:35.320 --> 3:35:36.320]  Helped sell it with the lie
[3:35:36.320 --> 3:35:38.320]  That he got these aluminum tubes
[3:35:38.320 --> 3:35:41.320]  From Nigeria, Niger someplace
[3:35:41.320 --> 3:35:43.320]  To make the weapons
[3:35:43.320 --> 3:35:45.320]  So we're giving you what
[3:35:45.320 --> 3:35:47.320]  No one else has really given you

[3:35:56.320 --> 3:35:58.320]  Prestitudes and the mainstream media
[3:35:58.320 --> 3:36:00.320]  Boris Johnson warns
[3:36:00.320 --> 3:36:02.320]  Russian victory in Ukraine
[3:36:02.320 --> 3:36:06.320]  Would be absolutely catastrophic
[3:36:06.320 --> 3:36:10.320]  Boris Johnson warns

[3:36:25.320 --> 3:36:28.320]  Like Boris Johnson
[3:36:28.320 --> 3:36:29.320]  The Boris Johnson

[3:36:31.320 --> 3:36:32.320]  Can't go out

[3:36:38.320 --> 3:36:41.320]  Another daddy's boy, by the way
[3:36:41.320 --> 3:36:43.320]  Another little nothing of a clown boy
[3:36:43.320 --> 3:36:45.320]  Nothing of a clown boy
[3:36:45.320 --> 3:36:47.320]  That couldn't fight their way again
[3:36:47.320 --> 3:36:51.320]  Out of a paper bag

[3:36:56.320 --> 3:36:59.320]  On Sunday
[3:36:59.320 --> 3:37:01.320]  Allowing Russian President Putin
[3:37:01.320 --> 3:37:04.320]  To succeed in his invasion of Ukraine
[3:37:04.320 --> 3:37:07.320]  Would have absolutely catastrophic
[3:37:07.320 --> 3:37:09.320]  Consequences for the world
[3:37:09.320 --> 3:37:12.320]  A fat face, how?

[3:37:13.320 --> 3:37:16.320]  Would have absolutely catastrophic
[3:37:16.320 --> 3:37:18.320]  Consequences for the world
[3:37:18.320 --> 3:37:20.320]  What's going on between Ukraine and Russia
[3:37:20.320 --> 3:37:22.320]  Like they're right next to each other
[3:37:22.320 --> 3:37:24.320]  Right, be part of each other
[3:37:24.320 --> 3:37:26.320]  On and off for centuries
[3:37:26.320 --> 3:37:29.320]  What does it have to do with the
[3:37:29.320 --> 3:37:31.320]  You know
[3:37:31.320 --> 3:37:32.320]  If it goes back to Russia
[3:37:32.320 --> 3:37:34.320]  Russia's in control of it
[3:37:34.320 --> 3:37:36.320]  How will that be catastrophic
[3:37:36.320 --> 3:37:37.320]  For the rest of the world
[3:37:37.320 --> 3:37:39.320]  Oh, I know, it's coming out of the fat mouth
[3:37:39.320 --> 3:37:41.320]  Of one of the murderous groups
[3:37:41.320 --> 3:37:45.320]  Of low-life people in the world
[3:37:45.320 --> 3:37:48.320]  The British are coming
[3:37:48.320 --> 3:37:49.320]  The British are coming
[3:37:49.320 --> 3:37:51.320]  No, not like that, Selenity
[3:37:51.320 --> 3:37:54.320]  The British are coming to kill you
[3:37:54.320 --> 3:37:56.320]  Oh, yeah
[3:37:56.320 --> 3:37:59.320]  American Revolution, who will we fight?
[3:37:59.320 --> 3:38:02.320]  Oh, I know, the sun never sets
[3:38:02.320 --> 3:38:04.320]  On the British Empire
[3:38:04.320 --> 3:38:06.320]  Empire?
[3:38:06.320 --> 3:38:08.320]  You made your murderous low lives
[3:38:08.320 --> 3:38:10.320]  To go into countries
[3:38:10.320 --> 3:38:13.320]  To steal what they have
[3:38:13.320 --> 3:38:16.320]  And you've been doing it for centuries
[3:38:16.320 --> 3:38:18.320]  Look at how you screwed up
[3:38:18.320 --> 3:38:20.320]  The world after World War I
[3:38:20.320 --> 3:38:22.320]  That you instigated
[3:38:22.320 --> 3:38:25.320]  Oh, yeah, cutting up
[3:38:25.320 --> 3:38:27.320]  You know, the Balfour Agreement
[3:38:27.320 --> 3:38:28.320]  All other things taking over
[3:38:28.320 --> 3:38:31.320]  Control of countries
[3:38:31.320 --> 3:38:33.320]  The British
[3:38:33.320 --> 3:38:34.320]  Or the Queen
[3:38:34.320 --> 3:38:36.320]  The nobility
[3:38:36.320 --> 3:38:37.320]  The nobility that don't do
[3:38:37.320 --> 3:38:39.320]  Number one and number two
[3:38:39.320 --> 3:38:42.320]  No, no
[3:38:42.320 --> 3:38:44.320]  The English
[3:38:44.320 --> 3:38:46.320]  The sun never sets on the British
[3:38:46.320 --> 3:38:48.320]  Oh, yeah, into the valley of death
[3:38:48.320 --> 3:38:49.320]  Road to 600
[3:38:49.320 --> 3:38:50.320]  What are you doing over there
[3:38:50.320 --> 3:38:53.320]  Trying to conquer Afghanistan?
[3:38:53.320 --> 3:38:56.320]  Wait a minute, let the Americans go
[3:38:56.320 --> 3:38:58.320]  Following the Russians
[3:38:58.320 --> 3:39:02.320]  And let them get slaughtered
[3:39:02.320 --> 3:39:05.320]  This clown goes on
[3:39:05.320 --> 3:39:08.320]  Speaking to Jake Tapper
[3:39:08.320 --> 3:39:12.320]  Hours after Russian missiles hit Kyiv
[3:39:12.320 --> 3:39:17.320]  Front page of the Wall Street Journal
[3:39:17.320 --> 3:39:22.320]  Russian missile strikes target Ukraine's capital
[3:39:22.320 --> 3:39:24.320]  Hey, who wrote this?
[3:39:24.320 --> 3:39:26.320]  Who wrote this?
[3:39:26.320 --> 3:39:28.320]  What prostitute?
[3:39:28.320 --> 3:39:34.320]  Alex or Alan Cullison
[3:39:34.320 --> 3:39:36.320]  And you leave a Cherenov
[3:39:36.320 --> 3:39:38.320]  Or you leave her at home
[3:39:38.320 --> 3:39:40.320]  Do whatever you want with her
[3:39:40.320 --> 3:39:45.320]  How come you weren't writing about
[3:39:45.320 --> 3:39:51.320]  U.S. missile strikes target
[3:39:51.320 --> 3:39:53.320]  All of the countries
[3:39:53.320 --> 3:39:56.320]  Where they've killed millions of people
[3:39:56.320 --> 3:40:02.320]  I didn't see this weekly, daily, hourly coverage
[3:40:02.320 --> 3:40:05.320]  With the Iraq War
[3:40:05.320 --> 3:40:08.320]  That they lied us into, both of them
[3:40:08.320 --> 3:40:10.320]  Oh, you remember the first Bush war?
[3:40:10.320 --> 3:40:12.320]  The first murderous Bush war?
[3:40:12.320 --> 3:40:15.320]  Oh, yeah, that the Iraqi soldiers
[3:40:15.320 --> 3:40:17.320]  Are going into hospitals
[3:40:17.320 --> 3:40:20.320]  And bayoneting little kids in incubators
[3:40:20.320 --> 3:40:22.320]  Remember that made-up story?
[3:40:22.320 --> 3:40:24.320]  Or Saddam Hussein?
[3:40:24.320 --> 3:40:26.320]  How come you weren't showing
[3:40:26.320 --> 3:40:28.320]  All of the deadliness
[3:40:28.320 --> 3:40:32.320]  That the United States and its NATO allies
[3:40:32.320 --> 3:40:35.320]  Were committing, oh, I forgot about Yugoslavia
[3:40:35.320 --> 3:40:38.320]  And the Kosovo war
[3:40:38.320 --> 3:40:41.320]  This is why you listen to info ones
[3:40:41.320 --> 3:40:44.320]  And this is why you subscribe to the Trends Journal
[3:40:44.320 --> 3:40:47.320]  I'm not taking a side here
[3:40:47.320 --> 3:40:49.320]  I'm just giving you facts
[3:40:49.320 --> 3:40:51.320]  As the prostitutes take sides
[3:40:51.320 --> 3:40:53.320]  And they're prostitutes because they're
[3:40:53.320 --> 3:40:56.320]  Medial whores that get paid to put out
[3:40:56.320 --> 3:40:58.320]  By their corporate pimps
[3:40:58.320 --> 3:41:00.320]  And their government whormasters
[3:41:00.320 --> 3:41:02.320]  So they're prostitutes
[3:41:02.320 --> 3:41:05.320]  And those are proper whores
[3:41:05.320 --> 3:41:08.320]  So, I would just say to the people
[3:41:08.320 --> 3:41:10.320]  In the United States
[3:41:10.320 --> 3:41:12.320]  That this is something that America
[3:41:12.320 --> 3:41:15.320]  Historically does and has to do
[3:41:15.320 --> 3:41:18.320]  And this is to step up for peace
[3:41:18.320 --> 3:41:21.320]  And freedom and democracy
[3:41:21.320 --> 3:41:25.320]  First of all, don't you say anything
[3:41:25.320 --> 3:41:27.320]  To the people in the United States
[3:41:27.320 --> 3:41:30.320]  Mind your own damn business
[3:41:30.320 --> 3:41:32.320]  I'm an American, I don't need
[3:41:32.320 --> 3:41:35.320]  A Mickey Mouse clown like you
[3:41:35.320 --> 3:41:37.320]  To tell me what to think
[3:41:37.320 --> 3:41:40.320]  And secondly, promoting the lines
[3:41:40.320 --> 3:41:43.320]  Of peace and freedom and democracy
[3:41:43.320 --> 3:41:46.320]  Yeah, it was a racket
[3:41:46.320 --> 3:41:49.320]  That was General Smedley Butler
[3:41:49.320 --> 3:41:51.320]  What, are you kidding me?
[3:41:51.320 --> 3:41:53.320]  Oh, like we brought freedom and democracy
[3:41:53.320 --> 3:41:55.320]  To Afghanistan?
[3:41:55.320 --> 3:41:57.320]  No, it's about 2.3 trillion dollars
[3:41:57.320 --> 3:42:00.320]  Left several billion dollars worth of weapons there
[3:42:00.320 --> 3:42:04.320]  These are the ignorant, arrogant, imbecilic
[3:42:04.320 --> 3:42:07.320]  Psychopaths, sociopaths, and pathological liars
[3:42:07.320 --> 3:42:10.320]  Running and ruining our life in a country near you
[3:42:10.320 --> 3:42:12.320]  If we don't unite for peace
[3:42:12.320 --> 3:42:14.320]  We're going to die in war
[3:42:14.320 --> 3:42:16.320]  Well, all these people want is power
[3:42:16.320 --> 3:42:18.320]  This clown boy says he's going to keep
[3:42:18.320 --> 3:42:20.320]  Staying in there despite
[3:42:20.320 --> 3:42:22.320]  All the criticism about him
[3:42:22.320 --> 3:42:26.320]  And his party's losing until 2030
[3:42:26.320 --> 3:42:29.320]  Get power hungry freaks
[3:42:29.320 --> 3:42:32.320]  That's a good picture of him
[3:42:32.320 --> 3:42:35.320]  He looks sober, almost
[3:42:35.320 --> 3:42:37.320]  Slobbingly slova
[3:42:37.320 --> 3:42:38.320]  Look at that jerk
[3:42:38.320 --> 3:42:40.320]  Hey, is that the natural color hair?
[3:42:40.320 --> 3:42:42.320]  How many bottles of dye did you throw on?
[3:42:42.320 --> 3:42:44.320]  Hey, listen, we're going to be back in a little while

[3:48:01.320 --> 3:48:06.320]  By the way, I'm going to talk about the economy and what's going on and what to expect.
[3:48:06.320 --> 3:48:15.320]  But first, I want to talk about supporting info wars and one of the ways you do it by supporting info wars, you're supporting yourself with these great products.

[3:48:46.320 --> 3:48:56.320]  You know, the World Health Organization estimates that nearly 50 million people will suffer from some kind of mental impairment related to eye dying deficiency.
[3:48:56.320 --> 3:49:04.320]  And even a CDC says that eye dying deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world.
[3:49:04.320 --> 3:49:11.320]  That's probably why so many people are brain dead. And that's why it's so important for you to try survival shield x2.

[3:50:14.320 --> 3:50:19.320]  So going back to the economy and the stupidity.
[3:50:19.320 --> 3:50:30.320]  I was talking before about how they artificially inflated the economy with zero and negative interest rate policy over there in the ECB.
[3:50:30.320 --> 3:50:34.320]  And zero interest rate in the United States even though.
[3:50:34.320 --> 3:50:40.320]  They're lying to us that they had a 2% inflation rate went over that they would raise rates.
[3:50:40.320 --> 3:50:43.320]  They said that oh it was only temporary transitory.
[3:50:43.320 --> 3:50:47.320]  And again in today's world now transgendatory inflation.
[3:50:47.320 --> 3:50:54.320]  And we said now this is going to happen and you better prepare prevail because it's going to get a lot worse.
[3:50:54.320 --> 3:50:57.320]  And now it is.
[3:50:57.320 --> 3:51:02.320]  The high they raise interest rates the deeper this thing is going to collapse.
[3:51:02.320 --> 3:51:08.320]  You already although housing sales went up in May is staying real big slowdowns everywhere.
[3:51:08.320 --> 3:51:18.320]  Your mortgage rate is almost double what it was a year ago.
[3:51:18.320 --> 3:51:22.320]  The higher the mortgage rates the higher the interest rates the deep in the economy falls.
[3:51:22.320 --> 3:51:31.320]  So what you need to do is you need to really fight for a new system.
[3:51:31.320 --> 3:51:41.320]  Because if the same criminal group is in charge of the government we're going to go down big and we're going to go down hard and deadly.
[3:51:41.320 --> 3:51:44.320]  Because in all else fails they take you to war.
[3:51:44.320 --> 3:51:46.320]  Just look at history.
[3:51:46.320 --> 3:51:47.320]  Now I don't want to go into it.
[3:51:47.320 --> 3:51:52.320]  I've gone into it a hundred times.
[3:51:52.320 --> 3:52:02.320]  And this is going to fail to me the only way.
[3:52:02.320 --> 3:52:07.320]  That we could change this is with a new political system.
[3:52:07.320 --> 3:52:13.320]  We have to get rid of the crime syndicate in there that have given nothing us nothing but disaster.
[3:52:13.320 --> 3:52:18.320]  And the people this one was better than that one that's their argument.
[3:52:18.320 --> 3:52:23.320]  Now Trump was better than Biden.
[3:52:23.320 --> 3:52:26.320]  McDonald's is better than Burger King.
[3:52:26.320 --> 3:52:29.320]  Where they done for we the people bottom line.
[3:52:29.320 --> 3:52:32.320]  What have they done for we the people.
[3:52:32.320 --> 3:52:35.320]  We need a new system.
[3:52:35.320 --> 3:52:38.320]  Without it we're finished.
[3:52:38.320 --> 3:52:45.320]  This clown freak Boris Johnson.
[3:52:45.320 --> 3:52:48.320]  It goes on.
[3:52:48.320 --> 3:52:52.320]  The cost to Western nation of defending Ukraine.
[3:52:52.320 --> 3:52:54.320]  Let's stop at that clown boy.
[3:52:54.320 --> 3:52:57.320]  It's.
[3:52:57.320 --> 3:53:03.320]  It's not my business as an American to defend.
[3:53:03.320 --> 3:53:08.320]  Ukraine again George Washington.
[3:53:08.320 --> 3:53:11.320]  Cross the Delaware really know how to fight.
[3:53:11.320 --> 3:53:14.320]  Not like you guys or girls.
[3:53:14.320 --> 3:53:20.320]  No foreign entanglements warning us explicitly not to get involved with European ones.
[3:53:20.320 --> 3:53:24.320]  And don't say whether you like a country or dislike.
[3:53:24.320 --> 3:53:31.320]  So how dare you say that we should be defending Ukraine and fat mouth.
[3:53:31.320 --> 3:53:35.320]  You're probably too stupid.
[3:53:35.320 --> 3:53:38.320]  And too arrogant.
[3:53:38.320 --> 3:53:40.320]  To have read.
[3:53:40.320 --> 3:53:48.320]  Your trends journal when we wrote all about it back in 2014.
[3:53:48.320 --> 3:53:54.320]  How the United States over through the democratically elected government the Victor Yanukovych in Ukraine.
[3:53:54.320 --> 3:53:56.320]  And form the coup.
[3:53:56.320 --> 3:54:00.320]  Oh the freedom and democracy that they're bringing that that kind.
[3:54:00.320 --> 3:54:02.320]  And Victoria Newland.
[3:54:02.320 --> 3:54:06.320]  Google it up December 2013.
[3:54:06.320 --> 3:54:14.320]  Saying in Washington DC with a sign of Chevron over one shoulder and standard oil over the next.
[3:54:14.320 --> 3:54:23.320]  That the United States pumped in five trillion dollars to non governmental organizations to bring democracy to Ukraine.
[3:54:23.320 --> 3:54:27.320]  It's a couple of months before the overthrow of the government.
[3:54:27.320 --> 3:54:33.320]  So when I got a clown boy like saying we should be defending.
[3:54:33.320 --> 3:54:35.320]  Ukraine.
[3:54:35.320 --> 3:54:43.320]  And quote you ready everybody dig into your pockets because clown boy Johnson said.
[3:54:43.320 --> 3:54:49.320]  That the price is worth paying for.
[3:54:49.320 --> 3:54:53.320]  Democracy and freedom.
[3:54:53.320 --> 3:54:57.320]  Is use that clown line on how many times the price.
[3:54:57.320 --> 3:55:00.320]  You mean the price of death and destruction.
[3:55:00.320 --> 3:55:06.320]  A stupid we said before the war started.
[3:55:06.320 --> 3:55:11.320]  A better negotiator peace deal with Russia.
[3:55:11.320 --> 3:55:13.320]  Because you're not going to beat him.
[3:55:13.320 --> 3:55:18.320]  And now Russia controls some 20% of Ukraine controls it.
[3:55:18.320 --> 3:55:21.320]  You're not going to get it back.
[3:55:21.320 --> 3:55:27.320]  You could have made a deal that wouldn't be all this money spent all this death and all destruction.
[3:55:27.320 --> 3:55:30.320]  But why should we listen to you so lengthy.
[3:55:30.320 --> 3:55:33.320]  Soros doesn't give you any money.
[3:55:33.320 --> 3:55:35.320]  Gates wouldn't give you a penny.
[3:55:35.320 --> 3:55:38.320]  Buffet not a dime.
[3:55:38.320 --> 3:55:40.320]  Why should we listen to you.
[3:55:40.320 --> 3:55:42.320]  A man of courage.
[3:55:42.320 --> 3:55:45.320]  Trends wisdom.
[3:55:45.320 --> 3:55:49.320]  Who fights for freedom peace and democracy.
[3:55:49.320 --> 3:55:57.320]  And as a trend forecasting record that I'll put up against anybody in the world show me your books your magazines.
[3:55:57.320 --> 3:56:02.320]  Why should we support you for peace when you see World War three coming.
[3:56:02.320 --> 3:56:07.320]  A further decline of our lives.
[3:56:07.320 --> 3:56:13.320]  Stealing more of our money as prices go higher so that bigs could get bigger.
[3:56:13.320 --> 3:56:17.320]  Oh you have a column in your magazine each week.
[3:56:17.320 --> 3:56:19.320]  Bigs getting bigger.
[3:56:19.320 --> 3:56:24.320]  And how merger and acquisition activity.
[3:56:24.320 --> 3:56:29.320]  In 2020 2021.
[3:56:29.320 --> 3:56:35.320]  The biggest climb ever as they jumped and juiced all that money.
[3:56:35.320 --> 3:56:39.320]  Into the pockets of the money junkies.
[3:56:39.320 --> 3:56:48.320]  Why should we give you anything for peace.
[3:56:48.320 --> 3:56:50.320]  That's where we're at.
[3:56:50.320 --> 3:56:52.320]  Back to the economy.
[3:56:52.320 --> 3:56:54.320]  The markets are mixed.
[3:56:54.320 --> 3:56:56.320]  To me.
[3:56:56.320 --> 3:57:01.320]  It's going to get a lot lot worse.
[3:57:01.320 --> 3:57:05.320]  Oil prices are going to continue to escalate I forecast.
[3:57:05.320 --> 3:57:14.320]  As the sanctions worse in our Russia and more tensions escalate in the Middle East.
[3:57:14.320 --> 3:57:19.320]  Businesses away off this covid wars destroyed them in ways that are unimaginable.
[3:57:19.320 --> 3:57:28.320]  Everywhere I go at night the streets are dead dead night 30 dead dead.
[3:57:28.320 --> 3:57:32.320]  Unite for peace and die for war occupied peace.
