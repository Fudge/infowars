[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.371]  They don't just kill children in torture dungeons.
[00:00:03.411 --> 00:00:07.594]  That's what they do in their off time to blow off some steam, to have a little fun.
[00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:19.703]  But in the real world, in the open public world, not the hidden one, they kill us with 5G and GMO and poison shots.
[00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.653]  And that's why Fauci defends the communist Chinese lockdowns.
[00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:32.619]  That's why Apple turned off protest communications right before the lockdown uprising started in China.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.521]  That's why Twitter helped.
[00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:36.904]  That's why Facebook helped.
[00:00:37.384 --> 00:00:38.826]  That's why Apple helped.
[00:00:39.326 --> 00:00:40.487]  Because that's who they are.
[00:00:40.888 --> 00:00:42.649]  And now the Chinese military is hitting the streets.
[00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.552]  Because China is what they wish they could do to you.
[00:00:45.852 --> 00:00:47.554]  They wish they could take your little farm.
[00:00:47.974 --> 00:00:49.436]  They wish they could take your children.
[00:00:49.736 --> 00:00:51.037]  They wish they could rape your wife.
[00:00:51.438 --> 00:00:53.660]  They are criminals of the highest order.
[00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.707]  They are rampaging Satanists who just have nothing but disdain for you because they are predators.
[00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:14.699]  And they see the domesticated, dumbed down, asleep, lackadaisical, learned helplessness, Stockholm Syndrome, addled public, and they see me on the table.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.483]  So don't become a wolf like them, and don't be a sheep.
[00:01:18.783 --> 00:01:21.145]  Be a sheepdog, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.751]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:32.412]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:36.574 --> 00:01:44.677]  All you have to do is check out what I'm saying, and that's why they run the fake headline against myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere, every day.
[00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.138]  Jones admits he's an actor.
[00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.400]  Or Tucker Carlson says nobody would take me seriously.
[00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.479]  Where do we say that?
[00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:53.480]  We never said that.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.880]  They just say we said that.
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.901]  But where's the clip?
[00:01:58.161 --> 00:01:59.061]  Where's the article?
[00:01:59.302 --> 00:02:00.002]  Where do we say that?
[00:02:00.022 --> 00:02:01.082]  It doesn't exist.
[00:02:01.662 --> 00:02:05.724]  Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist.
[00:02:06.064 --> 00:02:09.005]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show.
[00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:13.246]  The radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act.
[00:02:13.686 --> 00:02:15.607]  He's actually a performance artist.
[00:02:15.807 --> 00:02:17.067]  He's a performance artist.
[00:02:17.448 --> 00:02:18.588]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.873]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid.
[00:02:22.913 --> 00:02:27.717]  And it's all based on the custody battle with my ex-wife five years ago.
[00:02:28.298 --> 00:02:35.505]  And she was trying to put into evidence me dressed up more than a decade before, like the Joker, being sarcastic, saying, take your Prozac, kids.
[00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:36.827]  Take your illegal drugs, too.
[00:02:36.847 --> 00:02:37.888]  You'll die.
[00:02:37.948 --> 00:02:38.508]  It's fun.
[00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:40.590]  So people wouldn't take drugs.
[00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:45.052]  And they wanted to enter that in evidence and say, look, he's insane, telling kids to use drugs.
[00:02:45.672 --> 00:02:51.913]  And my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks that's really Jack Nicholson.
[00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:54.213]  So, yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander.
[00:02:54.653 --> 00:02:55.774]  Hail Cobra!
[00:02:56.074 --> 00:02:56.994]  Or Optimus Prime.
[00:02:57.234 --> 00:02:58.894]  Autobots, let's roll!
[00:02:59.274 --> 00:03:01.855]  Or the Joker, because I can do imitations of them all really good.
[00:03:02.355 --> 00:03:03.015]  Or Darth Vader.
[00:03:03.235 --> 00:03:05.455]  Don't act so surprised, globalist.
[00:03:06.355 --> 00:03:09.416]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[00:03:10.905 --> 00:03:12.266]  Do I really think I'm Darth Vader?
[00:03:12.466 --> 00:03:12.726]  No.
[00:03:12.746 --> 00:03:14.727]  Do I think I'm Optimus Prime?
[00:03:15.147 --> 00:03:15.787]  Bubble Commander?
[00:03:15.827 --> 00:03:16.247]  The Joker?
[00:03:16.307 --> 00:03:16.467]  No.
[00:03:16.767 --> 00:03:23.930]  And clearly, no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire that what I'm saying is what I really think.
[00:03:24.631 --> 00:03:26.091]  No one believes the Babylon Bee.
[00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:29.092]  It's not trying to lie to you, it's being sarcastic.
[00:03:29.393 --> 00:03:31.173]  Buy the Vaccinate Me Elmo doll today.
[00:03:31.553 --> 00:03:33.194]  It's required by the CDC.
[00:03:33.294 --> 00:03:34.595]  But they play those games.
[00:03:35.675 --> 00:03:37.856]  And that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to.
[00:03:38.316 --> 00:03:46.499]  Even though I tell people, okay, this is a joke, this isn't serious, they clip it out and they say, no, this is what he really believes.
[00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.080]  Every day when I leave work, I do this.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.741]  That man's a threat to this country.
[00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:53.022]  And they go, look, he admitted in court he's an actor.
[00:03:53.302 --> 00:03:55.783]  Well, yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly.
[00:03:56.163 --> 00:03:57.363]  I was an actor in Waking Life.
[00:03:57.784 --> 00:04:00.545]  I was an actor when I was Cobra Commander.
[00:04:02.751 --> 00:04:11.198]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host, up here reading news articles to you isn't a real thing and isn't something I'm actually saying.
[00:04:11.238 --> 00:04:11.999]  And you know that!
[00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:13.760]  You're insulted right now.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.062]  I'm even explaining that to you.
[00:04:15.382 --> 00:04:19.225]  And so am I. But that's who these people are.
[00:04:20.346 --> 00:04:23.489]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.791]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[00:04:27.116 --> 00:04:28.700]  I think Alex Jones seems really talented.
[00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:29.783]  He's smart.
[00:04:30.083 --> 00:04:31.427]  He's funny as hell.
[00:04:31.447 --> 00:04:32.529]  He's truly funny.
[00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.770]  I'm kind of retarded.
[00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:41.770]  [Music]
[00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:48.770]   Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes, do you now not listen to what I say about other things
[00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.770]   when I show you a powerful news article by Dr. Joseph Mercola on InfoWars.com?
[00:04:54.673 --> 00:04:59.176]  It has all the cited information, the latest tragedy, sudden adult death syndrome.
[00:04:59.697 --> 00:05:01.198]  No, that's a real thing.
[00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:04.381]  That's something happening in the real world.
[00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:06.623]  And that's what we're breaking down here today.
[00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:11.315]  I am Alex Jones, and I am the guy on this show every day.
[00:05:11.916 --> 00:05:24.468]  I am an American, and that's what I promote, is freedom, and justice, and liberty, and they can't stand it.
[00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:31.367]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:05:31.367 --> 00:05:41.367]  Info Wars has been banned.
[00:05:41.367 --> 00:05:43.367]  (rock music)
[00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:43.526]  Arrested.
[00:05:43.646 --> 00:05:49.849]  Attacked and threatened.
[00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:51.570]  Because we are effective.
[00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.712]  The Great Awakening is here.
[00:05:54.952 --> 00:05:56.673]  Go to Banned.Video.
[00:05:57.353 --> 00:05:59.494]  Download the videos and share.
[00:06:01.215 --> 00:06:10.375]   Support the information war at Infowarsstore.com And never give up the fight
[00:06:10.375 --> 00:06:34.294]   It's Tuesday, November 29th [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:27.960]  Get ready, we got a big broadcast lined up for you.
[00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:29.301]  Huge developments.
[00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:30.762]  Things just get more and more intense by the day.
[00:06:30.782 --> 00:06:32.944]  Again, we're live Tuesday, November 29th.
[00:06:32.964 --> 00:06:46.479]   A predatory Predatory corporate world government has openly been established and has announced itself and its in-game goal 90% forced depopulation of the earth.
[00:06:47.139 --> 00:07:04.227]  Communist China is their testing ground for their absolute tyranny and now we've seen the UN, the World Economic Forum, leftist political parties across the world, big tech, the major corporations, Hollywood, all line up against free speech.
[00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:19.339]  And they're now saying everywhere that free speech does break bones, and that anyone criticizing open borders, election fraud, gun confiscation, pedophilia, energy prices, wars, are criminals who need to be arrested.
[00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:23.602]  I've got a bunch of clips out of the gates with this openly being pushed.
[00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:27.472]  Openly being said, but let's remember the First Amendment.
[00:07:27.512 --> 00:07:39.919]  Congress shall make no law respecting and establishing of religion, prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people to peaceably assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
[00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.559]  The First Amendment to the U.S.
[00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:42.700]  Constitution, December 15, 1791.
[00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:51.237]  Everything you're seeing is a classical, high-tech version of tyranny.
[00:07:51.998 --> 00:07:59.087]  We saw Bob Baer of the CIA, who played it yesterday, over the weekend saying, your freedoms are pathetic.
[00:07:59.127 --> 00:08:02.110]  If there's no First Amendment, Americans shouldn't have any free speech.
[00:08:02.591 --> 00:08:04.614]  You don't want the Russians to win, do you?
[00:08:06.957 --> 00:08:08.819]  But there's a lot of big victories happening.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.466]  Elon Musk has come out and said he's going to release the files showing the government secretly running Twitter.
[00:08:14.507 --> 00:08:15.047]  We already know that.
[00:08:15.087 --> 00:08:16.249]  A bunch of documents already came out.
[00:08:18.151 --> 00:08:23.097]  And they've responded saying they want national security investigations of Musk.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:25.741]  Think about that.
[00:08:27.657 --> 00:08:33.520]  He's also come out and said, we're going to allow people to talk about COVID however they want and talk about their experiences.
[00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:35.841]  Oh, he's going to allow disinformation.
[00:08:36.202 --> 00:08:53.451]  That means challenging the official narrative that was a premeditated, global government, corporate created fraud, unified to push total lies on us and poison shots and suppress all sorts of treatments that were natural and healthy.
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:09:01.084]  Natural therapeutics, serious crimes against humanity, forced injections, Nuremberg Code violations.
[00:09:04.306 --> 00:09:06.827]  Meanwhile, Fauci's in a new video, we'll play that segment.
[00:09:07.608 --> 00:09:10.389]  He again defends Chinese lockdowns, saying they're great.
[00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.031]  We'll look at these incredibly tyrannical lockdowns.
[00:09:13.551 --> 00:09:15.532]  People locked up for hundreds of days.
[00:09:16.533 --> 00:09:17.514]  Not about the virus.
[00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:24.085]  A giant test of their social credit score where one day your smartphone says you're a yellow code.
[00:09:24.365 --> 00:09:25.446]  You can't return to your home.
[00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:26.767]  You live on the street for months.
[00:09:27.327 --> 00:09:30.289]  Another code tells you go to one of the emergency COVID camps.
[00:09:30.589 --> 00:09:31.970]  Another code says stay in your house.
[00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.492]  We're going to weld you inside your home for 120, 140 days.
[00:09:34.552 --> 00:09:37.634]  When your house catches on fire, you can't leave.
[00:09:40.694 --> 00:09:42.094]  And the fire department doesn't come.
[00:09:42.895 --> 00:09:46.316]  It's all about when I say jump, you ask how high.
[00:09:46.816 --> 00:09:50.697]  If I say stand on your head with your thumb on your rear end, you're going to do it.
[00:09:52.297 --> 00:10:02.300]  It's all cult brainwashing, all cult training, all weaponized psychological warfare being used against the people of the world.
[00:10:02.421 --> 00:10:03.721]  But first, let's get to these clips.
[00:10:03.761 --> 00:10:05.822]  Here's a reporter at the White House briefing.
[00:10:06.202 --> 00:10:10.283]  Quote, what tools do you have to stop Elon Musk from restoring free speech?
[00:10:12.025 --> 00:10:13.286]  Then Sheila Jackson Lee.
[00:10:13.706 --> 00:10:17.668]  It's very well documented that words nowadays can actually break your bones.
[00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:27.414]  John Kirby says President Biden will not defend or support the protest in China because they want to bring that type of tyranny here.
[00:10:28.555 --> 00:10:29.416]  Where is Congress?
[00:10:29.476 --> 00:10:30.336]  Where is the response?
[00:10:30.697 --> 00:10:31.957]  Where are people calling this out?
[00:10:31.977 --> 00:10:32.998]  Well, DeSantis has.
[00:10:34.339 --> 00:10:39.162]  DeSantis says Apple removing Elon Musk's Twitter from App Store warrants congressional response.
[00:10:41.101 --> 00:10:42.245]  We're talking about doing it.
[00:10:44.392 --> 00:10:45.516]  I know what Elon Musk did.
[00:10:45.757 --> 00:10:47.683]  I'll leave it at that for behind-the-scenes information.
[00:10:48.868 --> 00:10:53.169]  They're trying to take him over, trying to stop him launching some symbols of free speech.
[00:10:53.209 --> 00:10:57.309]  So he thought, well, I'll make it look like I'm going along with him by throwing Alex Jones over the bus.
[00:10:57.329 --> 00:10:59.670]  I don't agree with what he did, but I understand what he did.
[00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:06.391]  But he is definitely freeing up Twitter and they are in absolute full panic mode.
[00:11:06.831 --> 00:11:08.991]  That is all coming up.
[00:11:09.732 --> 00:11:20.983]   But first, this is a White House press briefing with reporters who are protected by the First Amendment, who are supposed to be the number one defenders Of the First Amendment.
[00:11:22.485 --> 00:11:27.891]  And here they are decrying it, hoping the American people and people of the world don't have a voice.
[00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:51.730]  Here it is.
[00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.312]  Are you concerned about that?
[00:11:53.372 --> 00:11:55.034]  What tools do you have?
[00:11:55.094 --> 00:11:58.839]  Who is it at the White House that is really keeping track of this?
[00:11:59.479 --> 00:12:25.674]  This is something that we're certainly keeping an eye on and look, we have always been very clear and that when it comes to social media platforms, it is their responsibility to make sure that when it comes to misinformation, when it comes to the hate that we're seeing, that they take action, that they continue to take action.
[00:12:25.794 --> 00:12:28.276]   Again, We're all keeping a close eye on this.
[00:12:28.356 --> 00:12:32.720]  We're all monitoring what's currently occurring.
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:40.466]  And we see, you know, we see it with our own eyes of what you all are reporting and just for ourselves what's happening on Twitter.
[00:12:41.087 --> 00:12:47.871]   But again, social media companies have a responsibility to prevent their platforms They're the ones coming at us with deadly shots.
[00:12:47.891 --> 00:12:50.472]  They're the ones caught lying on purpose on every front.
[00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:54.930]   directed at individual communities as we have been seeing and the president has
[00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:59.970]   been very clear on calling that out he'll continue to do that and we're
[00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.970]   gonna continue to monitor the situation. They're the ones coming at us with
[00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:08.251]   deadly shots they're the ones caught lying on purpose on every front you have
[00:13:08.251 --> 00:13:12.571]   the head of the CDC saying they knew the shots didn't work two plus years ago but
[00:13:12.571 --> 00:13:19.571]  they lied to us. It's just over the top.
[00:13:18.366 --> 00:13:23.888]  So anybody that disagrees with these known liars and gets in the way of their gas lighting is violent.
[00:13:24.989 --> 00:13:30.171]  They're the ones violently coming at us with their GMO and their poison shots and their 5G and the rest of it.
[00:13:30.611 --> 00:13:41.592]   Here's Governor DeSantis talking about Apple's open discussions, as Tim Cook did to me four years ago, of removing Twitter off of the App Store.
[00:13:41.592 --> 00:13:49.592]   And then when you also hear reports that Apple is threatening to remove Twitter from the App Store
[00:13:49.592 --> 00:13:57.592]   because Elon Musk is actually opening it up for free speech and is restoring a lot of accounts
[00:13:57.592 --> 00:14:05.592]   that were unfairly and illegitimately suspended for putting out accurate information about COVID.
[00:14:06.042 --> 00:14:08.822]  That's like one of the main things that's being reinstated.
[00:14:09.322 --> 00:14:14.504]  So many things these experts were wrong at, and you had people on Twitter that were calling that out.
[00:14:15.044 --> 00:14:20.825]  And Twitter, the old regime in Twitter, their response was to try to just suffocate the dissent.
[00:14:21.465 --> 00:14:27.086]  And Elon Musk knows that's not a winning formula, and so he's providing free speech.
[00:14:27.306 --> 00:14:45.331]   And so if Apple responds to that, By nuking them from the App Store, you know, I think that that would be a huge, huge mistake, and it would be a really raw exercise of monopolistic power that I think would merit a response from the United States Congress.
[00:14:45.391 --> 00:14:59.054]  And so, don't be a vassal of the CCP on one hand and then use your corporate power in the United States on the other to suffocate Americans and try to suppress their right to express themselves.
[00:14:59.687 --> 00:15:09.293]  That's right, it's now come out that Twitter, Google, Apple, all of them that are helping China suppress their peaceful dissidents, that they try to suppress us.
[00:15:09.693 --> 00:15:13.155]  What China's doing is their goal for us, total enslavement.
[00:15:13.175 --> 00:15:17.398]  But here's Sheila Jackson Lee now saying, no, no, words do break your bones.
[00:15:18.137 --> 00:15:20.679]  Let me just say this, uh, Reverend Sharpton.
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:28.306]  It is, uh, very well documented that words nowadays can actually, uh, break your bones.
[00:15:28.746 --> 00:15:30.447]  Words have generated violence.
[00:15:30.507 --> 00:15:31.228]  We've seen that.
[00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:34.871]  Yeah, when the Democrats call for people to go out and attack Republicans.
[00:15:34.891 --> 00:15:44.739]  And then we got John Kirby, the Defense Department spokesman, saying Biden's not gonna support, uh, people not wanting to live in a total medical tyranny and force injections and combat robots.
[00:15:44.919 --> 00:15:45.220]  Here it is.
[00:15:46.024 --> 00:15:54.046]  I'm wondering, what is the President's reaction when he hears protesters in China chant, freedom, or Xi Jinping, step down?
[00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:57.627]  The President's not going to speak for protesters around the world.
[00:15:57.887 --> 00:15:59.047]  They're speaking for themselves.
[00:16:00.248 --> 00:16:01.208]  So there's no reaction?
[00:16:02.308 --> 00:16:03.989]  These protesters are speaking for themselves.
[00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:07.590]  What we are doing is making it clear that we support the right of peaceful protest.
[00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:08.370]  Oh really?
[00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:09.710]  Unless it's the American people.
[00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.911]  You people running our country are criminals.
[00:16:11.931 --> 00:16:12.391]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:14.005 --> 00:16:21.048]  Every day before I come into the studio, I just sit back and marvel at the historic moment we're all living in right now.
[00:16:22.508 --> 00:16:23.969]  And I say to myself, you got to be calm.
[00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:26.610]  Got to come in here and just lay all this out.
[00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:30.832]  But then once I get on air and start talking about it, it's just wild.
[00:16:31.572 --> 00:16:36.474]  They've got the CIA on TV saying, screw your freedom.
[00:16:36.534 --> 00:16:37.574]  Free speech is a joke.
[00:16:38.475 --> 00:16:38.915]  It's over.
[00:16:41.172 --> 00:16:46.617]  They've got politicians everywhere openly saying, we've got to get rid of free speech for anybody we disagree with.
[00:16:46.957 --> 00:16:48.799]  You've got the UN saying they run free speech.
[00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:53.504]  You've got the head of this UN agency bragging they control the US media.
[00:16:55.646 --> 00:17:01.011]  Communist China is being lauded for locking people up for over 100 days who aren't even sick.
[00:17:01.591 --> 00:17:06.096]  They've all got social credit scores where the phone tells them, just wait here.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:07.881]  You're not allowed to leave this point.
[00:17:07.921 --> 00:17:09.682]  People just sit there on the street until they starve to death.
[00:17:10.082 --> 00:17:11.263]  Or you can't go back to your house.
[00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:12.483]  Or you're locked up in your house.
[00:17:12.804 --> 00:17:13.784]  Or you're going to a camp.
[00:17:15.165 --> 00:17:16.426]  And it's all UN-directed.
[00:17:16.466 --> 00:17:17.907]  It's all being set up worldwide.
[00:17:17.927 --> 00:17:18.907]  They're getting it ready for us.
[00:17:18.927 --> 00:17:21.329]  You already saw what they did in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.
[00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:22.409]  And they're bringing it all back.
[00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.992]  And then I see a lot of people are upset about it.
[00:17:27.012 --> 00:17:29.394]  But some other people just think, oh, it's for our own good.
[00:17:29.414 --> 00:17:30.394]  Let's go along with it.
[00:17:30.434 --> 00:17:31.515]  And then we'll get out of it.
[00:17:32.035 --> 00:17:33.256]  They have no life force.
[00:17:33.696 --> 00:17:34.537]  No common sense.
[00:17:36.109 --> 00:17:43.134]  No understanding of what's happening, and the average leftist knows they've got to defend the CCP because, well, they're the good guys.
[00:17:43.174 --> 00:17:49.858]  Remember under Trump, they had Washington Post headlines, GG Ping must crush Trump to save the world.
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:57.043]  GG Ping is a dictator on the order of Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler.
[00:17:58.044 --> 00:18:04.008]  He makes Kim Jong-un and Fidel Castro look like choir boys.
[00:18:06.072 --> 00:18:12.235]  And the most evil, corrupt, out of control, ruthless corporations are openly helping China suppress their people.
[00:18:16.356 --> 00:18:43.477]   And I saw last night, and by the way, China admits they're doing this, footage of them beating people over the heads, breaking people's arms, in China, if they try to leave their houses, or if they just randomly won't be bent over On a table in the middle of the street and an anal swab shoved in their rear end and the woman screaming and yelling and begging.
[00:18:47.718 --> 00:18:51.860]  And I was reading the Twitter comments and the leftists were saying she should do what she's told.
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.880]  It's for her own good.
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:19:01.023]  And you can see they break her wrists.
[00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.391]  They definitely torqued the hell out of it.
[00:19:09.772 --> 00:19:11.672]  Maybe she's double-jointed, maybe it didn't break her arm.
[00:19:12.133 --> 00:19:23.857]  It looks like they break her wrist, and then they bend her over and men in white jumpsuits shove something in her rear end for a virus they cooked up in a lab with a poison shot they've got.
[00:19:24.157 --> 00:19:31.560]  And again, they lock people up for over 100 days in high-rises when the virus only stays in the body for less than 14, even if you believe the official story.
[00:19:33.371 --> 00:19:37.094]  It's all about what can you get people to put up with.
[00:19:37.494 --> 00:19:46.441]  And it's about Xi Jinping testing his dictatorship and his towns and cities to see who will enforce this god-awful insane evil on people.
[00:19:47.522 --> 00:19:51.005]  If you ask why Hitler did all the things he did that were so bad, it was about power.
[00:19:51.705 --> 00:19:53.387]  Or the communists in Russia, it's about power.
[00:19:54.247 --> 00:19:55.628]  Or why do cults do what they do?
[00:19:55.929 --> 00:19:58.691]  Because they want control over people's minds.
[00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:01.353]  They are satanic control freaks.
[00:20:04.517 --> 00:20:05.658]  But we've got Fauci.
[00:20:07.199 --> 00:20:09.001]  The full video is on Infowars.com.
[00:20:09.101 --> 00:20:11.143]  Again, defends Chinese lockdowns.
[00:20:11.163 --> 00:20:11.603]  Here it is.
[00:20:12.964 --> 00:20:20.150]  China's official news agency today published an op-ed asserting that the country's strict COVID measures are scientific and effective.
[00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.791]  Are they?
[00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:31.829]  Well, when you want to shut down in order to interrupt immediately a process that's going on like the spread of infection, there should be a purpose to it.
[00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:39.256]   Like you want to make sure you get enough ventilators or enough PPE or you want to get your population Vaccinated.
[00:20:39.316 --> 00:20:46.924]  The comment that I made about their severe actions that they've taken is that you have to have an endgame.
[00:20:47.024 --> 00:20:47.825]  What's the purpose?
[00:20:47.885 --> 00:21:01.855]   If the purpose is let's get all the people vaccinated, particularly the elderly, then okay for a temporary period of time to do that, but they have very, very strict type of a lockdown, they're locking people in their homes,
[00:21:01.855 --> 00:21:08.394]   which is really, they can't even go out and, from what I hear, shop or walk a dog or something like that.
[00:21:08.394 --> 00:21:14.786]   That's going to create a lot of pushback on the part of the population if there's no underlying purpose of what you
[00:21:14.786 --> 00:21:15.395]  want to do.
[00:21:15.395 --> 00:21:20.596]   Now what are you seeing here? Oh, we just lock you up for a few months and give you forced injections.
[00:21:20.736 --> 00:21:21.597]  That's the good cop.
[00:21:21.917 --> 00:21:27.021]  The bad cop locks you up for 120 days, 140 days, and lets you starve to death.
[00:21:27.601 --> 00:21:35.246]  So see, now just locking us up and having forced injections and vaccine passports and anal swabs, that's okay.
[00:21:36.247 --> 00:21:40.750]  It's just don't lock people up for over 100 days while they starve to death.
[00:21:41.871 --> 00:21:45.974]  So that's the psychology that's being pushed here.
[00:21:47.182 --> 00:21:56.228]  And that's the plan that these people are carrying out, and they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:21:56.928 --> 00:22:08.447]   It's all UN, WEF, Rockefeller Foundation developed, Microsoft deployed, UN enforced, on record,
[00:22:08.447 --> 00:22:12.928]   censoring the media, surveilling the public for control, and the end game is China,
[00:22:12.928 --> 00:22:16.688]   and all the rest of us are being forcibly marched towards this point.
[00:22:16.688 --> 00:22:23.248]  They're going right to the end.
[00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:24.445]  Can they lock you up in their house?
[00:22:24.465 --> 00:22:25.506]  Can they take you away to camp?
[00:22:25.986 --> 00:22:26.947]  No judge, no jury.
[00:22:27.267 --> 00:22:28.988]  So he said, what is the endgame?
[00:22:29.308 --> 00:22:53.203]   The endgame is the biomedical establishment being the priesthood for the big banks that own the big pharmaceutical companies having world control and a world ID and saying they can just disappear you at any time they want while they cook up a bunch of gain-of-function viruses that'll kill the majority of people deader than a hammer and while the very people cooking them all up are obsessed With depopulation.
[00:22:53.623 --> 00:22:56.005]  Are obsessed with world government.
[00:22:56.446 --> 00:23:01.029]  Are obsessed with killing you, and they tell you that's who they are.
[00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:05.293]  Bill Gates is on record hundreds of times saying he wants to forcibly depopulate the Earth.
[00:23:06.614 --> 00:23:07.435]  His father is.
[00:23:07.735 --> 00:23:08.736]  Prince Charles is.
[00:23:09.036 --> 00:23:10.337]  Prince Charles' father.
[00:23:10.477 --> 00:23:18.204]  I'm sorry, King Charles III's father, Prince Philip, is on record saying he wants to kill 80% of the world with a deadly virus.
[00:23:23.078 --> 00:23:29.762]  And Klaus Schwab says China is the model of communism and we need to be under a Chinese model.
[00:23:30.122 --> 00:23:30.982]  Wake up folks!
[00:23:31.302 --> 00:23:32.643]  That's who the bad guys are.
[00:23:32.883 --> 00:23:33.924]  That's the worldview.
[00:23:34.264 --> 00:23:35.505]  That's the transformation.
[00:23:35.805 --> 00:23:36.805]  That's the program.
[00:23:37.126 --> 00:23:38.246]  That's the operation.
[00:23:38.566 --> 00:23:39.347]  That's what they want.
[00:23:40.782 --> 00:23:58.491]  And that's why they want us off air, because we read their own documents decades ago, we've interviewed all the top guests, we've got their number, we know their plan, and there's all these thousands of other shows and thousands of flavors of political idiocy that are side issues and diversions.
[00:23:58.691 --> 00:24:08.316]  You know, I could come back next segment and do the most entertaining, hilarious hour you've ever seen making fun of the left and what buffoons they are, and showing you insane stuff.
[00:24:09.346 --> 00:24:11.526]  But it just makes you feel good, like you're laughing at them.
[00:24:11.846 --> 00:24:14.587]  Those are the people that have succumbed to the spirit of collapse.
[00:24:16.267 --> 00:24:19.168]  Just sitting here laughing at everything burning around us is not good.
[00:24:20.468 --> 00:24:24.249]  But it is important to look at what they've done to these people, and we'll cover some of that when we come back.
[00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:28.509]  Remember the guy involved who runs the US nuclear stockpile?
[00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:30.030]  He just got arrested.
[00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:31.450]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:37.911]  Alright, so let's look at the clown world of the globalist minions they're putting in charge of civilization.
[00:24:39.912 --> 00:24:45.533]  To collapse it and make the good, hard-working people that care, who built civilization, quit and leave.
[00:24:47.334 --> 00:24:55.996]  Biden's gender-fluid nuclear official, the one that looks like it's a clown, charged with felony theft after lying to the police.
[00:24:58.136 --> 00:24:59.596]  Now, why are you surprised?
[00:24:59.676 --> 00:25:06.998]  This is the person involved in our spent nuclear fuel stockpile and the storage of nuclear weapons.
[00:25:10.452 --> 00:25:11.693]  They'll do whatever they're told.
[00:25:13.194 --> 00:25:14.515]  They're totally compromised.
[00:25:15.296 --> 00:25:22.421]  And they're selling the message that you'll be promoted and put in positions of power if you illegally come here or if you're a degenerate.
[00:25:24.402 --> 00:25:25.443]  And what did he reportedly do?
[00:25:25.483 --> 00:25:26.884]  He's pled guilty to it.
[00:25:26.904 --> 00:25:39.774]  He admits that he saw a $2,200 bag at the airport and stole it and then got videotaped at the same DC airport flying in and out with the stolen bag.
[00:25:41.459 --> 00:25:43.380]  When the police called him, he said, it's my bag.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.300]  It's my clothes.
[00:25:45.321 --> 00:25:49.743]  Later admitted, well, I took it, but you know, I identify it as mine.
[00:25:49.883 --> 00:25:50.443]  I'm not joking.
[00:25:51.304 --> 00:25:52.564]  Says, I identify this as mine.
[00:25:52.945 --> 00:25:53.945]  That's the magical thinking.
[00:25:53.965 --> 00:25:54.986]  Well, you identify as a woman.
[00:25:55.286 --> 00:26:00.608]  The woman is now an ugly man with a bald head and a beard in lipstick.
[00:26:02.069 --> 00:26:03.010]  It's a joke on women.
[00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:03.890]  These guys hate women.
[00:26:06.211 --> 00:26:07.772]  And it just continues on from there.
[00:26:09.437 --> 00:26:14.225]  Video Disney show has kids hold up signs saying we love Satan.
[00:26:16.349 --> 00:26:17.411]  Starting to get the pattern here.
[00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:19.674]  It's not just Balenciaga.
[00:26:22.359 --> 00:26:23.180]  And that's for Christmas!
[00:26:24.824 --> 00:26:25.464]  Here's another one.
[00:26:25.524 --> 00:26:26.845]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:26:27.205 --> 00:26:37.071]  Washington Post, New York Times, and New York Post praise pedophile play as brilliant that humanizes convicted pedophiles that rape children and stalk playgrounds.
[00:26:37.411 --> 00:26:44.215]  They all say it's wonderful, and there's even video of the play where they drool over the children.
[00:26:46.156 --> 00:26:50.338]  Pedophiles are good, and the mainstream media praises it.
[00:26:52.165 --> 00:26:57.726]  Meanwhile, thousands of convicted pedophiles in California are getting less than a year of prison time.
[00:26:58.206 --> 00:27:05.188]  People that brutally kidnap and rape children under 14 are given less time than drunk drivers.
[00:27:05.467 --> 00:27:21.467]   plus. That ladies and gentlemen is this anti-human alien force.
[00:27:21.121 --> 00:27:32.326]  That tells you a woman is somebody that looks like they're an alien toddling off the spaceship in close encounters of a third time.
[00:27:33.686 --> 00:27:37.468]  Non-binary nuclear official charged with stealing woman's luggage.
[00:27:37.568 --> 00:27:38.068]  What do you know?
[00:27:40.129 --> 00:27:42.130]  Then we've got all this we'll be getting into later.
[00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:52.713]   Top Balenciaga fashion stylist Social media loaded with images of satanic child abuse, witchcraft, satanism, you name it.
[00:27:52.733 --> 00:27:56.075]  We're going to be going into that some in the next hour.
[00:27:56.095 --> 00:27:57.876]  Viewer discretion is advised.
[00:27:58.337 --> 00:27:59.797]  And it's the whole thing is like this.
[00:27:59.878 --> 00:28:00.698]  It's just it's everywhere.
[00:28:00.718 --> 00:28:03.820]  It'd be like trying to count fish in the sea to tell you what's going on.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.661]  They organize their people.
[00:28:07.822 --> 00:28:08.683]  They're making their move.
[00:28:08.703 --> 00:28:10.184]  Remember yesterday, I played you a clip.
[00:28:12.679 --> 00:28:33.697]  In fact, guys, go ahead and print me the Belgian pedophile scandal, where the government, top officials, judges, police chiefs, had dungeons full of little kids they were raping, murdering, and torturing, and they found a bunch of dungeons full of dead kids, and some full of kids, who are now grown women, who describe what they did in the dungeons, satanic rituals.
[00:28:34.318 --> 00:28:35.299]  These are confirmed!
[00:28:36.219 --> 00:28:37.661]  This isn't, oh, debatable.
[00:28:39.639 --> 00:28:44.682]  Some magic nebulous pizza place, or, oh, what Q says is down under the earth.
[00:28:44.702 --> 00:28:46.703]  It's not under the earth, it's out in the open.
[00:28:49.944 --> 00:28:50.444]  That's all.
[00:28:52.565 --> 00:28:58.448]  Coming up at the start of the next hour.
[00:28:58.468 --> 00:29:02.790]  Then we're going to open the phones up and take your calls.
[00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:10.511]   But they don't just Kill children in torture dungeons, that's what they do in their off time to blow off some steam, to have a little fun.
[00:29:12.213 --> 00:29:22.641]  But in the real world, in the open public world, not the hidden one, they kill us with 5G and GMO and poison shots.
[00:29:25.287 --> 00:29:29.592]  And that's why Fauci defends the communist Chinese lockdowns.
[00:29:30.013 --> 00:29:35.559]  That's why Apple turned off protest communications right before the lockdown uprising started in China.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.442]  That's why Twitter helped.
[00:29:38.022 --> 00:29:39.804]  That's why Facebook helped.
[00:29:40.285 --> 00:29:43.408]  That's why Apple helped because that's who they are.
[00:29:43.808 --> 00:29:48.472]  And now the Chinese military is hitting the streets because China is what they wish they could do to you.
[00:29:48.772 --> 00:29:50.474]  They wish they could take your little farm.
[00:29:50.894 --> 00:29:52.355]  They wish they could take your children.
[00:29:52.655 --> 00:29:53.957]  They wish they could rape your wife.
[00:29:54.357 --> 00:29:56.599]  They are criminals of the highest order.
[00:29:56.859 --> 00:30:03.625]  They are rampaging Satanists who just have nothing but disdain for you because they are predators.
[00:30:05.287 --> 00:30:17.609]  And they see the domesticated, dumbed down, asleep, lackadaisical, learned helplessness, Stockholm Syndrome, addled public, and they see me on the table.
[00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:21.390]  So don't become a wolf like them, and don't be a sheep.
[00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:32.072]  Be a sheepdog, ladies and gentlemen, and admit this is happening, admit this is going on, and admit this is their revolution to normalize all of this.
[00:30:33.097 --> 00:30:38.701]  Where they flip on emotions and, oh, you said something that hurts my feelings, you're arrested, but we're gonna screw your kid.
[00:30:38.741 --> 00:30:42.104]  Or we're gonna give you a deadly shot, gives you a heart attack.
[00:30:42.424 --> 00:30:51.591]  I have stacks of articles of children and young people dying of heart attacks at rates 10, 20,000, what they were before, unheard of, with these shots.
[00:30:52.732 --> 00:31:00.518]  And the federal government puts a study out saying children are having heart attacks and dying because you told them the shot would give them a heart attack.
[00:31:01.078 --> 00:31:01.719]  With no proof!
[00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:09.976]  COVID-19 vaccines and the misrepresentation of perceived side effects clearly on the safety of vaccines.
[00:31:11.738 --> 00:31:13.399]  A new major study with no evidence.
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.021]  Oh, it's psychological!
[00:31:17.763 --> 00:31:25.089]  Yes, even though their own CDC document, October 2000, said it would cause myocarditis, blood clots, and heart attacks.
[00:31:25.589 --> 00:31:32.218]   Now if you know that, now if you see that, now if you witness that, Now if you say it's wrong, you're the devil.
[00:31:32.459 --> 00:31:45.370]  So we consider it make fun of the head of the nuclear spent fuel radiation dump head and go look at the clown confessing to stealing a woman's expensive bag.
[00:31:48.113 --> 00:31:50.775]  By the way, who would want a $2,300 bag?
[00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:52.917]  You want the status.
[00:31:52.937 --> 00:31:53.638]  You want people looking at you.
[00:31:53.898 --> 00:31:54.979]  All that does is get you robbed.
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:56.380]  I got a $50 suitcase.
[00:31:58.459 --> 00:32:00.380]  In fact, I almost don't even wear this Rolex.
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:05.123]  I never wore watches until my dad, like 15 years ago, gave me a green Rolex, which I like.
[00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:07.184]  It's just a cool watch, and I like it.
[00:32:07.744 --> 00:32:09.305]  But not because it's a luxury item.
[00:32:09.545 --> 00:32:16.009]  But I think I'm going to hang this up, and I think I'm going to get like a $100 regular watch.
[00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:20.472]  Just because I don't even want to contribute to this.
[00:32:20.492 --> 00:32:21.833]  There's nothing wrong with nice brands.
[00:32:22.173 --> 00:32:23.193]  Nothing wrong with wanting nice things.
[00:32:23.233 --> 00:32:25.435]  But in this dangerous world, it's just stupid.
[00:32:25.635 --> 00:32:27.496]  So how do I tell my oldest daughter?
[00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:33.132]  Another family member gave her a Rolex.
[00:32:33.653 --> 00:32:34.593]  Don't wear that, sweetheart.
[00:32:34.914 --> 00:32:46.463]  How do I tell my 18-year-old daughter, don't wear one of these if you don't want to get hit on the head or robbed by the head of the nuclear stockpile?
[00:32:47.504 --> 00:32:48.104]  How do I do that?
[00:32:48.124 --> 00:32:52.968]  And it's nothing wrong with it, except it becomes a symbol of the largesse.
[00:32:53.028 --> 00:32:54.630]  It really becomes an idol.
[00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:56.511]  And I'm not judging anybody.
[00:32:56.551 --> 00:32:57.232]  I like my watch.
[00:32:57.392 --> 00:32:59.392]  I'm wearing it 15 years.
[00:32:59.392 --> 00:33:02.270]  But...
[00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:06.112]  Do I love this more than my family?
[00:33:05.803 --> 00:33:07.064]  Do I love this more than my freedom?
[00:33:07.966 --> 00:33:08.967]  Why do I even care about it?
[00:33:09.307 --> 00:33:18.999]  Because all our real values, our due process, and our bodies, and control over our bodies, and control over our sovereignty and our currency, it's all being stolen, so we cling!
[00:33:20.322 --> 00:33:26.605]  To our house, and our swimming pool, and our Rolex, and our car, and going to a ball game thinking, well, at least I get this little bit of respite.
[00:33:26.805 --> 00:33:30.606]  But it's because you don't fully commit to fighting the tyranny, you're going to lose it all.
[00:33:30.806 --> 00:33:39.090]  There's nothing wrong with all that nice stuff, but it shouldn't come first, it shouldn't come second, it shouldn't come third, it shouldn't come fourth, it shouldn't come fifth.
[00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:40.831]  God should come first.
[00:33:41.171 --> 00:33:42.512]  Your family should come second.
[00:33:42.772 --> 00:33:43.413]  Your country.
[00:33:43.773 --> 00:33:44.633]  Doing the right thing.
[00:33:44.914 --> 00:33:45.834]  Being a good person.
[00:33:46.094 --> 00:33:46.915]  Being engaged.
[00:33:46.995 --> 00:33:47.836]  Being involved.
[00:33:48.256 --> 00:33:48.976]  Being informed.
[00:33:49.036 --> 00:33:49.617]  Being healthy.
[00:33:49.657 --> 00:33:50.257]  Being strong.
[00:33:50.658 --> 00:33:55.581]  All that comes before all the stupid trappings and garbage.
[00:33:56.622 --> 00:33:57.923]  It's a hierarchy of needs.
[00:33:58.283 --> 00:33:59.844]  We gotta get our heads screwed on now.
[00:33:59.864 --> 00:34:00.805]  We'll be right back.
[00:34:00.825 --> 00:34:02.746]  Alright, welcome back.
[00:34:02.786 --> 00:34:05.448]  So let's talk about documented real evil.
[00:34:07.193 --> 00:34:16.561]  And how, whether it's these reports being mocked on the internet, on Twitter, on Facebook by the left, or whether it's them mocking the Chinese lockdowns on Twitter and saying how great it is, they wish that was here.
[00:34:17.862 --> 00:34:22.906]  The average person imagining they're part of Xi Jinping's takeover and loving the tyranny because they pretend they're part of it.
[00:34:23.326 --> 00:34:24.067]  Totally insane.
[00:34:24.127 --> 00:34:25.007]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:34:25.488 --> 00:34:27.489]  Here are stacks of mainstream news articles.
[00:34:28.931 --> 00:34:29.551]  Stacks of them.
[00:34:30.712 --> 00:34:32.914]  DW.com, New York Times, all of it.
[00:34:34.676 --> 00:34:37.678]  Germany, 30,000 potential suspects in pedophile ring.
[00:34:38.759 --> 00:34:42.841]  Children given to known pedophiles over several decades by the government to be raped.
[00:34:43.342 --> 00:34:44.642]  Belgium pedophile scandal.
[00:34:45.703 --> 00:34:47.904]  Belgium still haunted by pedophile scandal.
[00:34:48.485 --> 00:34:51.247]  Belgian pedophile planned underground city of victims.
[00:34:51.367 --> 00:34:51.727]  Lawyer.
[00:34:53.768 --> 00:34:56.690]  Harmony and Security.
[00:34:56.910 --> 00:35:00.993]  Serial pedophile planned underground city with victims.
[00:35:02.401 --> 00:35:03.801]  The revelation of WikiLeaks.
[00:35:04.842 --> 00:35:06.802]  Europe cracks down on global pedophile ring.
[00:35:06.842 --> 00:35:08.102]  This is all real.
[00:35:08.982 --> 00:35:10.203]  This is all real.
[00:35:10.243 --> 00:35:11.143]  This is confirmed.
[00:35:14.184 --> 00:35:17.404]  And it goes on and on and on and on.
[00:35:17.764 --> 00:35:24.746]  All these major institutions, all these major organizations, they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:35:26.949 --> 00:35:31.654]  And they're recruiting people that will then get involved in this so they can trust to put in positions of power.
[00:35:31.674 --> 00:35:38.040]  It came out last year, the CIA would initiate mayors in Afghanistan.
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:44.005]  Before they put a mayor in charge, they would have them rape little children as a sign that they were under their control.
[00:35:44.326 --> 00:35:45.707]  That's mainstream news!
[00:35:47.308 --> 00:35:48.489]  That's NBC news!
[00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:50.772]  They just hide this stuff in plain view!
[00:35:53.004 --> 00:36:01.430]  So I played a couple minute clip of this yesterday, but I'm going to play a larger clip right now, the testimony of Anique Lucas, survivor of the Belgian Pedophile Network.
[00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:09.495]  Children were mainly used for sex, but there were a number of aristocrats who were part of the club who also enjoyed killing children.
[00:36:09.955 --> 00:36:12.337]  Listen to this and realize what we're really up against.
[00:36:13.274 --> 00:36:14.454]  My name is Annika Lucas.
[00:36:15.195 --> 00:36:16.055]  I am a mom.
[00:36:16.875 --> 00:36:17.475]  I have pets.
[00:36:18.516 --> 00:36:22.937]  And I'm currently the leader of an organization that brings yoga into prisons.
[00:36:23.477 --> 00:36:26.938]  I'm also a survivor of child sex trafficking.
[00:36:28.579 --> 00:36:38.482]  I was raised in Belgium and sold into a murderous pedophile network right around my sixth birthday.
[00:36:38.502 --> 00:37:09.518]   I was used in this network For five years and a half, adult men that were part of this exclusive club were there for various reasons, but there was a lot of alcohol, a lot of drugs, and the children were the commodity, the highest, the most valued commodity.
[00:37:11.491 --> 00:37:13.994]  And were used for sex mostly.
[00:37:15.616 --> 00:37:24.626]  But there were a number of aristocrats that were part of this club who also liked killing children.
[00:37:26.528 --> 00:37:28.030]  And then my time had come.
[00:37:29.952 --> 00:37:32.675]  At the age of 11, I was about to be killed.
[00:37:34.713 --> 00:37:42.575]  I was tortured because someone who had protected me for a while and then abused me really badly was done with me.
[00:37:43.916 --> 00:37:56.479]  I was strapped to a butcher's block that was black from the blood of all the children that had come before me.
[00:37:56.499 --> 00:38:09.896]   I was there for a few hours My body is full of scars.
[00:38:11.498 --> 00:38:14.020]  And every scar reminds me of the moment.
[00:38:16.482 --> 00:38:26.630]  I thought that I was going to be killed like all the children that weren't loved enough to live.
[00:38:27.591 --> 00:38:29.692]  And I was going to be forgotten as well.
[00:38:30.873 --> 00:38:32.655]  And I wasn't ready to die.
[00:38:34.449 --> 00:38:39.092]  Someone from inside that network loved me enough to rescue me.
[00:38:42.414 --> 00:38:45.296]  That torture lasted a few hours.
[00:38:46.757 --> 00:38:52.160]  However, I was in that network for five years and a half.
[00:38:53.981 --> 00:38:58.784]  In that time, I was raped many, many, many times.
[00:39:01.548 --> 00:39:06.070]  I don't have any scars to show how many times I was raped.
[00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:08.390]  But I did the math.
[00:39:10.471 --> 00:39:13.692]  Usually it was a whole night and a weekend.
[00:39:14.512 --> 00:39:23.175]  And so I gathered that I was raped, actually raped, for about six hours a week.
[00:39:22.995 --> 00:39:34.995]  1,716 hours of rape before I reach the age of 12.
[00:39:34.995 --> 00:39:37.914]  (breathing deeply)
[00:39:38.137 --> 00:39:55.785]  I grew up with instructions that were given to me by the person who rescued me, that kept me out of prostitution, kept me away from drugs, led me out of the country, Belgium, where I was, where this all happened.
[00:39:58.466 --> 00:40:10.894]   As a young adult, Though I didn't have any scars, I had been projected upon so much as a sexual object that I attracted men.
[00:40:12.536 --> 00:40:18.260]  And part of me needed that to live, because that was the only way I knew how to feel good.
[00:40:20.402 --> 00:40:41.632]   And as a young woman, I was so disrespected and so used And yet everyone was so ready to put the blame with me for being promiscuous, for being, as was said, cheap, a whore.
[00:40:43.554 --> 00:40:48.137]  All these things, all these epithets, so quick to denounce me.
[00:40:49.637 --> 00:40:57.377]   And then as I was healing, I realized, no, I have to break out of this pattern that I'm in,
[00:40:57.377 --> 00:41:02.476]  that I need sexual attention.
[00:41:02.476 --> 00:41:05.996]  So let me break away from it.
[00:41:05.996 --> 00:41:08.836]  Let me not objectify myself at all.
[00:41:08.836 --> 00:41:11.418]  Let me become a liberated woman.
[00:41:11.418 --> 00:41:19.877]   And so I worked for decades and decades, feeling into all the pain of what was done to me,
[00:41:19.877 --> 00:41:25.458]  all the betrayal of being sold by my parents.
[00:41:25.458 --> 00:41:29.617]  Children are the most vulnerable of our population.
[00:41:29.617 --> 00:41:40.717]   We want to create a society where children will be safe, where children will have a community around them,
[00:41:40.717 --> 00:41:43.438]  around them.
[00:41:43.485 --> 00:41:44.926]  Every child deserves safety.
[00:41:45.766 --> 00:41:52.190]  No child deserves what I went through and what millions of children each day go through.
[00:41:54.711 --> 00:42:01.486]   But, unfortunately, the way the system is right now, That is part of the system.
[00:42:02.947 --> 00:42:14.235]  As women, we have so much potential to be truly empowered by feeling into everything that we as women endure.
[00:42:15.376 --> 00:42:18.819]  That gives us more strength than anyone.
[00:42:19.479 --> 00:42:29.358]   All that pain behind all that powerlessness and that humiliation Really feeling into what was done to me.
[00:42:29.679 --> 00:42:33.004]  Really understanding that it wasn't me.
[00:42:34.025 --> 00:42:36.890]  That at the end of the day, I'm okay.
[00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:38.392]  I was a child.
[00:42:38.873 --> 00:42:40.235]  I was being victimized.
[00:42:40.215 --> 00:42:42.215]  It wasn't my fault.
[00:42:42.215 --> 00:43:01.715]  Annika Lucas is a hero.
[00:43:02.357 --> 00:43:06.720]  They rape children to scar them for life and make them hate themselves, but she transcended it.
[00:43:07.221 --> 00:43:07.921]  She's a hero.
[00:43:08.822 --> 00:43:12.865]  And we're champions of the children, and we can't fight the pedophile rings without you.
[00:43:13.305 --> 00:43:19.130]  When you fund this operation, you are literally battling satanic pedophiles at point-blank range.
[00:43:20.131 --> 00:43:26.576]  So many of the people we directly face on a day-to-day basis in Infowars are operatives of this cult and are involved in it.
[00:43:27.056 --> 00:43:29.358]  They are sick, and they are evil, and they will burn in hell.
[00:43:30.831 --> 00:43:32.352]  But we need your funding to stay on air.
[00:43:32.372 --> 00:43:33.772]  And we've got incredible products.

[00:45:50.026 --> 00:46:02.026]  Our government was responsible for their deaths.
[00:46:02.097 --> 00:46:02.678]  You hear me now?
[00:46:02.698 --> 00:46:03.218]  I hear him inside!
[00:46:03.038 --> 00:46:05.038]  100,000 people.
[00:46:05.038 --> 00:46:09.038]  You hear me?
[00:46:09.038 --> 00:46:15.038]  I can saw it right now!
[00:46:15.038 --> 00:46:16.038]  I hear him inside!
[00:46:16.038 --> 00:46:20.038]  Several party members have been murdered, Chief Inspector.
[00:46:20.038 --> 00:46:31.038]   We're interrupting your regularly scheduled program to bring you this terrifying report.
[00:46:31.252 --> 00:46:33.714]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:46:34.274 --> 00:46:36.215]  It just pancaked.
[00:46:36.275 --> 00:46:40.058]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[00:46:40.078 --> 00:46:43.040]  New York, very much a city still in chaos.
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.261]  The phones are not working properly.
[00:46:45.301 --> 00:46:47.383]  The subway lines are not working properly.
[00:46:47.403 --> 00:46:52.226]  The sky now black with smoke in front of us, just across the Tigris River here.
[00:46:52.766 --> 00:46:56.709]  This is shock and awe, Tom, to the population of Baghdad.
[00:46:57.730 --> 00:46:59.411]  Sharp and o'er, indeed.
[00:46:59.891 --> 00:47:05.235]  The people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the American military.
[00:47:05.875 --> 00:47:09.858]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.481]  It is a big idea.
[00:47:14.041 --> 00:47:15.102]  A new world order.
[00:47:15.342 --> 00:47:16.083]  I love my dad.
[00:47:17.302 --> 00:47:18.162]  I'd kill for him.
[00:47:18.283 --> 00:47:20.544]  I'd go to prison for him, because I love him so much.
[00:47:20.684 --> 00:47:21.684]  I love Bill Clinton.
[00:47:21.764 --> 00:47:24.546]  What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[00:47:24.886 --> 00:47:25.706]  My sister-in-law.
[00:47:25.786 --> 00:47:31.449]  When you are subverting the power of government, that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to democracy.
[00:47:31.489 --> 00:47:33.030]  What do you think of Edward Snowden?
[00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:34.752]  I think he's a traitor.
[00:47:35.012 --> 00:47:38.797]  Obama is the one that kills the US troops if the Russians bomb any of them.
[00:47:38.817 --> 00:47:40.539]  Obama is the one that put them in harm's way.
[00:47:40.679 --> 00:47:42.922]  Obama is the one using them as human shields.
[00:47:43.122 --> 00:47:47.348]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[00:47:47.368 --> 00:47:48.449]  I'm here to warn people!
[00:47:48.469 --> 00:47:49.731]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[00:47:50.031 --> 00:47:50.892]  This isn't a game!
[00:47:55.478 --> 00:47:56.819]  Welcome to America, ISIS!
[00:47:56.859 --> 00:47:57.960]  This is what we do!
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:58.620]  Woo!
[00:47:59.641 --> 00:48:02.583]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:48:02.683 --> 00:48:04.384]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:48:04.404 --> 00:48:06.025]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:48:06.165 --> 00:48:15.571]  In 2012, your agency was saying, quote, the Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria.
[00:48:15.712 --> 00:48:16.592]  In 2012, the U.S.
[00:48:16.632 --> 00:48:19.374]  was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups.
[00:48:19.774 --> 00:48:20.875]  And why did you not stop that?
[00:48:20.955 --> 00:48:22.156]  Why didn't you come forward before?
[00:48:22.396 --> 00:48:23.517]  What were you waiting for?
[00:48:23.757 --> 00:48:25.138]  Well, for you, Inspector.
[00:48:26.158 --> 00:48:26.939]  I needed you.
[00:48:26.959 --> 00:48:36.424]  I suddenly had this feeling that everything was connected.
[00:48:36.664 --> 00:48:43.348]  We're all part of it.
[00:48:43.368 --> 00:48:44.889]  Are we ready for it?
[00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:52.390]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:48:52.390 --> 00:49:08.390]  I want you to get up now.
[00:49:08.922 --> 00:49:10.966]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[00:49:12.299 --> 00:49:22.686]  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'M AS MAD AS HELL AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
[00:49:23.887 --> 00:49:33.293]  I want you to get up right now, stick your head out of the window, open it, and stick your head out and keep yelling and yell, I'M AS MAD AS HELL AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
[00:49:33.813 --> 00:49:37.156]  Just get up from your chairs, right now, go to the window!
[00:49:37.256 --> 00:49:38.036]  Where are you going?
[00:49:38.236 --> 00:49:39.897]  I wanna see if anybody's yelling!
[00:49:42.299 --> 00:49:46.765]  How am I going to take this anymore?
[00:49:46.945 --> 00:49:48.207]  I'm mad as hell!
[00:49:48.347 --> 00:49:51.611]  I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:49:51.611 --> 00:50:07.611]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:50:07.611 --> 00:50:08.611]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:50:08.611 --> 00:50:09.611]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:50:10.402 --> 00:50:16.001]   It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:50:16.001 --> 00:50:29.601]  [Music]
[00:50:29.601 --> 00:50:35.001]   Again, I want to thank you all for joining us on this live Tuesday, November 29th, worldwide broadcast.
[00:50:35.212 --> 00:50:36.333]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:50:38.703 --> 00:50:48.311]  And I want to look at just some examples of the private corporate government that is taking the planet over right now.
[00:50:49.492 --> 00:50:55.157]  World Economic Forum, its influence and control now extend to legislation and regulations in the UK.
[00:50:55.217 --> 00:50:59.320]  They appear to have seamlessly replaced the European Union.
[00:51:00.521 --> 00:51:05.485]  And they've now announced three months ago that the WEF is co-equal to the UN.
[00:51:06.667 --> 00:51:08.949]  And as merged with the United Nations.
[00:51:08.969 --> 00:51:12.171]  Because the governments have no power in the UN.
[00:51:13.652 --> 00:51:16.014]  Except for a handful of them in the Security Council.
[00:51:16.655 --> 00:51:18.616]  And then the UN bureaucracy runs everything else.
[00:51:19.397 --> 00:51:20.217]  Here's that document.
[00:51:21.078 --> 00:51:22.599]  His Majesty's Government.
[00:51:25.741 --> 00:51:27.963]  Regulation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
[00:51:28.423 --> 00:51:29.024]  White paper.
[00:51:29.704 --> 00:51:32.987]  That talks about being under direct control of Klaus Schwab in the UK.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:39.762]  Laura Ingraham talked about this, the architect of sovereign destruction, Klaus Schwab.
[00:51:39.782 --> 00:51:45.945]  And they wrote all these articles attacking yours truly, saying, Jones is crazy!
[00:51:46.565 --> 00:51:49.826]  He claims Klaus Schwab wants to take over your government.
[00:51:50.687 --> 00:51:56.769]  If you go to his Wikipedia, it links right to his own website, he says, we want to capture democracy and take control from the people.
[00:51:57.049 --> 00:51:57.610]  That's a quote.
[00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:00.411]  They say we've penetrated the cabinets.
[00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:07.554]  Meanwhile, the World Economic Forum says, how to take a strategic approach to investing in metaverse.
[00:52:07.574 --> 00:52:13.579]  Because they're going to lock you down during the future lockdowns and make you work through the VR goggles.
[00:52:13.599 --> 00:52:19.184]  But there's been totally rejected, but they don't care because they need to imprison you in your home.
[00:52:19.544 --> 00:52:23.487]  They need to control your environment to fully engage in their mind control.
[00:52:23.768 --> 00:52:25.249]  They're a mind control cult.
[00:52:27.090 --> 00:52:29.993]  How to take a strategic approach to investing in the metaverse.
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:34.762]  And it goes on from there.
[00:52:36.143 --> 00:52:38.285]  Oh, you won't actually visit islands anymore.
[00:52:38.865 --> 00:52:41.768]  You'll pay to virtually visit them.
[00:52:42.969 --> 00:52:44.551]  And here are the names of the programs.
[00:52:45.091 --> 00:53:04.770]   Complete Control, Microsoft Magic Leap, Infrastructure Control, Meta, that's Facebook, Content Control, Axie, Platform Control, Roblox, They're gonna lock you in your house and make you live in their false reality.
[00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:05.571]  You say, I'll never do that.
[00:53:06.131 --> 00:53:07.652]  It'll be tied to your social credit score.
[00:53:08.793 --> 00:53:10.815]  It'll be tied to you being able to travel.
[00:53:10.875 --> 00:53:13.317]  It'll be tied to you when they do let you out of your house.
[00:53:13.698 --> 00:53:20.003]  How much time do you spend in this hellscape brainwashing set they make you put on your head?
[00:53:20.023 --> 00:53:32.294]   Remember the eight-year-old video and photos of Mark Zuckerberg strutting through His Facebook event and there are all his employees wearing the VR goggles hunched over their laptops.
[00:53:33.595 --> 00:53:34.976]  He's not wearing the VR goggles.
[00:53:36.016 --> 00:53:37.418]  You got the bag over your head.
[00:53:37.798 --> 00:53:38.879]  You're under their control.
[00:53:39.299 --> 00:53:40.260]  They're the master now.
[00:53:42.821 --> 00:53:44.923]  And that's why I'm so torn by Elon Musk.
[00:53:46.264 --> 00:53:47.025]  I know what's going on.
[00:53:50.027 --> 00:53:52.809]  It's like the good cop, bad cop with Fauci.
[00:53:54.989 --> 00:53:57.411]  Oh, I believe in lockdowns and forced injections.
[00:53:57.791 --> 00:53:59.292]  But not more than two months.
[00:53:59.312 --> 00:54:01.574]  A hundred days is too long.
[00:54:03.935 --> 00:54:05.096]  He's the good cop.
[00:54:05.416 --> 00:54:07.558]  He just wants you locked up and forced injected.
[00:54:07.638 --> 00:54:09.319]  Not for more than a hundred days, though.
[00:54:11.541 --> 00:54:14.263]  And Elon's like, well, I'm for free speech for some people.
[00:54:15.684 --> 00:54:18.426]  But regardless, he is freeing up Twitter to a great extent.
[00:54:19.026 --> 00:54:21.448]  He is letting people expose the vaccines are deadly.
[00:54:22.543 --> 00:54:24.564]  So he's a real paradox, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:25.624 --> 00:54:27.965]  Is he a man walking a tightrope in a balancing act?
[00:54:29.666 --> 00:54:31.327]  Hey, he's better than the average globalist.
[00:54:32.147 --> 00:54:34.928]  So I'm gonna sit back and try to analyze it as fairly as I can.
[00:54:35.629 --> 00:54:37.049]  What do you think of Elon Musk?
[00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:39.170]  I'm gonna open the phones up today.
[00:54:40.351 --> 00:54:42.992]  And the rest of the hour, I have a special guest joining us.
[00:54:45.353 --> 00:54:46.814]  And we're gonna talk about Elon Musk.
[00:54:48.554 --> 00:54:54.070]   And we're gonna talk About is he good or is he bad or is he playing both sides?
[00:54:55.331 --> 00:54:56.913]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:54:56.933 --> 00:54:56.993]  877-789-2539.
[00:54:57.013 --> 00:54:57.253]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:54:57.073 --> 00:55:01.872]   seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight
[00:55:01.872 --> 00:55:08.992]   nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine Alex and let's
[00:55:08.992 --> 00:55:15.473]   let's get first-time callers on again please only refer some color in the
[00:55:15.473 --> 00:55:18.019]   first round Second round of calls, we'll take everybody's calls.
[00:55:18.059 --> 00:55:18.600]  We love you all.
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:21.903]  But 877-789-2539.
[00:55:22.143 --> 00:55:25.386]  Elon drops bombshell about free speech suppression.
[00:55:27.968 --> 00:55:28.929]  Files he's found.
[00:55:31.454 --> 00:55:35.816]  Elon Musk says expose of Twitter's free speech suppression coming soon.
[00:55:36.176 --> 00:55:36.976]  We all know it's there.
[00:55:36.996 --> 00:55:37.697]  We have the documents.
[00:55:38.297 --> 00:55:42.879]  Twitter stops enforcing COVID-19 misinformation because everything the establishment put out was a lie.
[00:55:43.159 --> 00:55:43.859]  We were the truth.
[00:55:44.679 --> 00:55:45.740]  Good stuff by Elon.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:50.722]  And incredible quotes by Elon about tyranny is taking over the world.
[00:55:50.802 --> 00:55:52.342]  Only free speech can counter it.
[00:55:53.103 --> 00:55:55.444]  But then he goes along with it, censoring me.
[00:55:56.184 --> 00:56:00.786]  Twitter is no longer enforcing its COVID-19 disinformation rules.
[00:56:02.878 --> 00:56:07.021]  Very, very interesting, isn't it?
[00:56:10.303 --> 00:56:10.903]  It's a big deal.
[00:56:13.165 --> 00:56:15.126]  So Elon Musk sounds like Alex Jones.
[00:56:15.887 --> 00:56:23.892]  Is it that Elon Musk knows the populists are winning, knows humanity's rising, and he wants to be the maverick?
[00:56:25.009 --> 00:56:35.595]  It's like he took over PayPal, or took over Tesla, or took over NASA, or took over all these things, taking over Twitter, and he doesn't want people to know about Alex Jones.
[00:56:36.016 --> 00:56:37.356]  Because I'm not in a competition with Elon.
[00:56:37.777 --> 00:56:42.499]  Actually, if he'd actually be real and do this, I'm ready to disappear right now.
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:44.400]  Believe me.
[00:56:48.123 --> 00:56:48.963]  I'm ready right now.
[00:56:50.444 --> 00:56:51.885]  I don't want the power, I don't want any of it.
[00:56:55.188 --> 00:56:57.950]  But Elon, literally, I had it in my tweets and I lost it.
[00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:59.131]  Guys, pull up Elon's Twitter.
[00:57:00.072 --> 00:57:10.321]  Last night and today, he says like, tyranny's taking over, only free speech stands in its way, there's a world government, it's out of control, our children are being enslaved, if we don't stand against this, and there's a bunch of incredible tweets.
[00:57:10.601 --> 00:57:12.022]  I don't know how I lost it in my stack.
[00:57:12.323 --> 00:57:13.384]  I'll try to find it during the break.
[00:57:14.765 --> 00:57:16.542]   But It's all over the news.
[00:57:16.582 --> 00:57:18.304]  Just type in Elon.
[00:57:18.524 --> 00:57:19.384]  I'll do it on my phone.
[00:57:19.624 --> 00:57:20.245]  I'll show the crew.
[00:57:20.285 --> 00:57:20.785]  I love the crew.
[00:57:20.825 --> 00:57:21.486]  I'll show you right now.
[00:57:21.506 --> 00:57:22.186]  I'll do it myself.
[00:57:22.786 --> 00:57:25.768]  Just go to Google, or go to Bing, or go to DuckDuckGo.
[00:57:25.808 --> 00:57:26.669]  Go wherever you want.
[00:57:26.689 --> 00:57:29.131]  Just type in Elon Tyranny.
[00:57:29.451 --> 00:57:29.871]  There it is.
[00:57:30.832 --> 00:57:33.754]  This is a battle for the future of civilization.
[00:57:34.794 --> 00:57:35.735]  Where have you heard that before?
[00:57:36.195 --> 00:57:41.278]  If free speech is lost, even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead.
[00:57:42.899 --> 00:57:43.660]  Write that again for me.
[00:57:45.714 --> 00:57:47.914]  I have nothing but support for what Elon just said there.
[00:57:49.875 --> 00:58:02.778]  But then he wants you to take a brain chip with Neuralink, and he wants you to be bathed in 5G satellites, and he, he does all, and he wants you to have the electric cars that actually have slave mines and cobalt mines, and he talks about babies dying in their arms.
[00:58:03.218 --> 00:58:04.478]  My baby died in my arms!
[00:58:04.498 --> 00:58:05.458]  I don't like Alex Jones!
[00:58:05.498 --> 00:58:06.819]  Like, I'm the ultimate sin!
[00:58:07.279 --> 00:58:10.299]  Oh, I questioned a mass shooting, now his child died in his arms.
[00:58:10.379 --> 00:58:11.400]  Alex Jones did that.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:12.880]  Alex Jones is the devil.
[00:58:14.389 --> 00:58:19.051]  So no, Elon, I don't want to be the Christ figure in this because I'm not like Christ.
[00:58:19.531 --> 00:58:22.733]  I love Christ and I want to be like Christ, but I'm not like Christ.
[00:58:24.013 --> 00:58:27.895]  I'm a wicked, wicked devil, but I know that and I made the right choice.
[00:58:28.235 --> 00:58:30.476]  But you want to say I'm the devil?
[00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:51.836]  And you quote Christ against me and say that I don't suffer the children, that I've hurt the children, that I should have a millstone tied around my neck, while you are the second largest owner of cobalt mines in Africa where hundreds of children die a month as young as 10 years old in cave-ins and death.
[00:58:52.076 --> 00:58:54.957]  Did you hold the black children in your arms?
[00:58:54.977 --> 00:58:56.497]  Look, I know that's industrialization.
[00:58:56.838 --> 00:58:58.138]  I know that's a job for the future.
[00:58:58.378 --> 00:58:59.278]  I know the world's rough.
[00:58:59.559 --> 00:59:00.539]  I never judged you on it.
[00:59:02.176 --> 00:59:07.022]  But you're like the owner of that big NBA team that said, I don't care about Uyghur slaves in China.
[00:59:07.302 --> 00:59:15.591]  And then you sit up there all high and mighty and say, Alex Jones is the most evil man on earth, but I'm good.
[00:59:15.692 --> 00:59:16.753]  I'm Elon Musk.
[00:59:16.833 --> 00:59:17.914]  And it's just a joke.
[00:59:18.214 --> 00:59:21.879]  But then the paradox, he's doing all this good stuff.
[00:59:23.783 --> 00:59:25.303]  But see, that's the good cop, bad cop.
[00:59:25.323 --> 00:59:26.324]  At the end of the day, that's what it is.
[00:59:26.764 --> 00:59:28.584]  He knows there's a big movement against tyranny.
[00:59:29.025 --> 00:59:30.625]  He knows that's where the real future is.
[00:59:31.005 --> 00:59:33.646]  So what he's doing is hedging his bets.
[00:59:34.446 --> 00:59:35.947]  Well, Elon, I didn't hedge my bets.
[00:59:37.107 --> 00:59:40.508]  And I'm way richer when it comes to spiritual strength and truth than you'll ever be.
[00:59:40.808 --> 00:59:46.450]  That's why you've got to plagiarize everything I say and do while you try to bury the real thing.
[00:59:48.353 --> 00:59:50.974]  But Elon, one day, you will die.
[00:59:51.594 --> 00:59:52.535]  You will face your maker.
[00:59:53.295 --> 00:59:55.256]  And I hope before then, you receive the Holy Spirit.
[00:59:55.776 --> 01:00:04.260]  You know, I see a lot of great callers on the board here, and we don't really screen your calls other than you have a clean phone line, and you have a topic you want to cover.
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:09.662]  But when I do say we're covering a topic, that means we're covering that topic.
[01:00:09.742 --> 01:00:11.143]  What do you think of Elon Musk?
[01:00:11.803 --> 01:00:13.024]  Is he good or is he bad?
[01:00:14.004 --> 01:00:17.706]  So I want to talk to Michael in Hawaii about the division and lack of common sense.
[01:00:19.451 --> 01:00:23.452]  I want to talk to these other callers like George.
[01:00:23.472 --> 01:00:25.413]  Let's talk about DeSantis in 2024.
[01:00:27.093 --> 01:00:28.914]  But we're talking about Elon Musk.
[01:00:28.954 --> 01:00:32.275]  So I'm going to go to all the first callers that are about Elon Musk and I'll get to you.
[01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:32.975]  And I'm not mad at you.
[01:00:32.995 --> 01:00:35.696]  It's just like, I want to hear what you have to say about this.
[01:00:38.457 --> 01:00:41.278]  Because again, he's doing so much good, but also so much bad.
[01:00:41.578 --> 01:00:45.319]  He's now come out and said he's going to release all the documents how Twitter was working with the U.S.
[01:00:45.359 --> 01:00:47.300]  government illegally to manipulate the 2020 election.
[01:00:49.199 --> 01:00:49.739]  And the 2022.
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:51.800]  Great!
[01:00:52.021 --> 01:00:59.945]  That's so much better than what Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai and all the rest of them are doing.
[01:01:00.025 --> 01:01:00.365]  Great!
[01:01:00.545 --> 01:01:05.808]  So, I ask the question, then, what's really going on here?
[01:01:07.188 --> 01:01:10.950]  Well, he says free speech is critical to stop tearing and save civilization.
[01:01:12.491 --> 01:01:15.553]  But he goes with an official story about me that isn't even true.
[01:01:17.637 --> 01:01:18.317]  We know what he's doing.
[01:01:18.417 --> 01:01:19.978]  Saving his ass by throwing me under the bus.
[01:01:20.418 --> 01:01:22.279]  Which is fine for me at the end of the day.
[01:01:22.299 --> 01:01:27.861]  I just don't know if this guy is evil, or is good, or is nothing but a pure opportunist.
[01:01:29.562 --> 01:01:31.502]  Big Truckin' Tim in Ohio.
[01:01:31.582 --> 01:01:32.663]  First caller, you're on the air.
[01:01:32.683 --> 01:01:34.503]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:34.543 --> 01:01:35.364]  How you doing, brother?
[01:01:35.624 --> 01:01:36.004]  Good, man.
[01:01:37.365 --> 01:01:39.505]  Hey, I just want to say thanks.
[01:01:39.585 --> 01:01:44.907]  First off, I've been listening to you about three years, ever since this COVID crap started.
[01:01:47.475 --> 01:01:55.075]   and you woke me up to it, and the red flags and everything else, the product's phenomenal.
[01:01:55.075 --> 01:01:58.635]  I can't even say enough, but thanks.
[01:01:58.635 --> 01:02:00.515]  Thank you, brother.
[01:02:00.515 --> 01:02:04.034]  Secondly, Elon, you wanna talk about Elon?
[01:02:04.034 --> 01:02:05.494]  I don't trust him.
[01:02:05.494 --> 01:02:13.154]   I mean, if you're gonna be on one side or the other, pick a side, don't play both sides of the fence.
[01:02:13.154 --> 01:02:19.275]   I mean, go balls to the wall, for lack of a better term, but pick a side, you know?
[01:02:19.275 --> 01:02:22.675]   If you're gonna be free speech, you're gonna let things out.
[01:02:22.749 --> 01:02:25.010]  Let everybody out and say they're free speech.
[01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:31.812]  You know, that is the great, one of the things that made America great and we're founded upon.
[01:02:33.073 --> 01:02:40.156]  If you want to play God like he's doing with you guys and then for wars and everything else, but oh, we can't let Alex back on.
[01:02:40.516 --> 01:02:43.077]  God forbid, I might upset the wrong person.
[01:02:44.212 --> 01:02:45.153]  No, I agree with you.
[01:02:45.173 --> 01:02:49.055]  The question is, we know he's playing both sides, but is he good or is he bad?
[01:02:49.575 --> 01:02:50.395]  What's your gut tell you?
[01:02:50.435 --> 01:02:52.997]  I think my gut tells me he's bad.
[01:02:53.597 --> 01:02:57.699]  My gut tells me that he's setting up a lot of people to fall.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:02.382]  And, just like Taunsi Gabbard, you know, I don't trust her either.
[01:03:03.483 --> 01:03:07.865]  Like you said, judge a tree by its fruits, not by, you know, not by what they say.
[01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:11.407]  And, that can go with anything in your life.
[01:03:11.894 --> 01:03:17.155]  You know, actions speak louder than words, and I've been taught that since I can't even remember.
[01:03:17.875 --> 01:03:18.695]  No, I hear you, brother.
[01:03:18.735 --> 01:03:19.655]  I appreciate your call.
[01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:21.756]  I'm going to take a call in Italy.
[01:03:21.776 --> 01:03:23.976]  I'll probably pronounce this wrong.
[01:03:24.636 --> 01:03:27.577]  It's Severino or Severano.
[01:03:28.197 --> 01:03:29.237]  Thanks for calling from Italy.
[01:03:29.257 --> 01:03:29.777]  You're on the air.
[01:03:29.797 --> 01:03:31.618]  Hi, Alex.
[01:03:31.658 --> 01:03:32.978]  My name is Saverio, anyway.
[01:03:33.278 --> 01:03:34.058]  Saverio.
[01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:35.138]  OK, thank you.
[01:03:35.218 --> 01:03:36.599]  Saverio, what a beautiful name.
[01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:37.659]  Go ahead.
[01:03:37.679 --> 01:03:38.179]  Thank you, sir.
[01:03:38.635 --> 01:03:48.563]  Hey, I want to let you know this guy, Eli Mosby, is a snake in the grass because he attacking you, which you are nobody in the planet.
[01:03:48.663 --> 01:03:50.084]  You know are the president.
[01:03:50.104 --> 01:03:50.925]  You are nobody.
[01:03:51.305 --> 01:03:52.706]  So they are scared of you.
[01:03:52.726 --> 01:03:54.547]  He's a snake in the grass.
[01:03:55.208 --> 01:03:56.549]  It works for them.
[01:03:56.569 --> 01:04:01.673]  Tesla is financed from the government.
[01:04:01.693 --> 01:04:04.155]  They give money to him to run this Tesla.
[01:04:05.247 --> 01:04:06.007]  Are you lucky?
[01:04:06.107 --> 01:04:07.748]  Are you blessed that you are not Twitter?
[01:04:08.308 --> 01:04:16.871]  I hope Trump will not go to Twitter and like Steve Bannon say, we got destroyed the Federal Bank.
[01:04:16.931 --> 01:04:18.451]  We got to print our money.
[01:04:18.891 --> 01:04:20.372]  You guys got to print the money.
[01:04:20.872 --> 01:04:22.072]  We don't need these people.
[01:04:22.632 --> 01:04:23.953]  These people, they kill us.
[01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:26.833]  This Karl Schwab, who is that?
[01:04:27.754 --> 01:04:28.994]  He's coming from where?
[01:04:29.014 --> 01:04:31.315]  Who is this guy running the planet?
[01:04:31.555 --> 01:04:32.115]  Look, China.
[01:04:32.839 --> 01:04:34.980]  We gotta destroy these people by any way.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.260]  We gotta start a civil war.
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.261]  Unfortunately, it is what it is.
[01:04:39.901 --> 01:04:41.121]  Italy, we are lucky.
[01:04:41.602 --> 01:04:52.285]  Meloni, she starts running like Mussolini, which he was a good man until the Federal Reserve, they want to destroy him.
[01:04:52.765 --> 01:04:54.885]  And they kill us like they killed Mussolini.
[01:04:55.166 --> 01:04:56.366]  I'm half Jewish too.
[01:04:56.906 --> 01:04:57.866]  I'm Italian Jewish.
[01:04:58.567 --> 01:05:00.127]  And you know, I support the AIDS.
[01:05:00.914 --> 01:05:07.342]  And I wish Alec Jones and Steve Bennett run for be a president and vice president.
[01:05:07.762 --> 01:05:09.564]  You guys be saved upon it.
[01:05:09.844 --> 01:05:10.866]  God bless you, Alec.
[01:05:11.406 --> 01:05:13.369]  Thank you for calling, sir, from Italy.
[01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:15.751]  Let's take another call.
[01:05:16.052 --> 01:05:19.656]  Michael in Hawaii does want to talk about Elon Musk and division and lack of common sense.
[01:05:19.996 --> 01:05:20.617]  Go ahead, Michael.
[01:05:20.637 --> 01:05:21.298]  Thanks for calling.
[01:05:22.572 --> 01:05:23.152]  You're welcome.
[01:05:23.812 --> 01:05:26.713]  And thank you for doing such a good job, Mr. Jones.
[01:05:26.833 --> 01:05:27.533]  I'm trying, brother.
[01:05:27.553 --> 01:05:28.354]  Please don't thank me.
[01:05:28.874 --> 01:05:30.314]  I'm pretty exhausted, though.
[01:05:30.334 --> 01:05:30.814]  Go ahead.
[01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:33.475]  Okay.
[01:05:33.635 --> 01:05:40.057]  The theme of Musk, I believe, is billionaires are going to save us one more time.
[01:05:40.077 --> 01:05:41.117]  Okay?
[01:05:42.037 --> 01:05:44.298]  And it's completely false, I believe.
[01:05:45.976 --> 01:06:07.016]   While your good cop bad cop analogy is is spot-on I believe that there's a time where the villain plays the leading role and he's you know a shining knight okay until he Is a villain, alright?
[01:06:07.336 --> 01:06:11.397]  And I believe that, uh, he's only following the family business, okay?
[01:06:11.717 --> 01:06:27.002]  Transhumanism, as Fauci, uh, is following his family business, whose Italian name, I love the Italian crawler, he's wonderful, but, uh, the name Fauci transmits, uh, translates to scythe, as in the Grim Reaper.
[01:06:27.762 --> 01:06:29.823]  It actually does, and it's sickle.
[01:06:32.061 --> 01:06:37.405]  A sickle is a side, you're right, it's just farming implement in some places.
[01:06:38.246 --> 01:06:44.750]  I got to play with a side in my youth and a sickle is a smaller side.
[01:06:45.831 --> 01:06:54.237]  But it's amazing that he's achieved such success, Bill Gates, following in the family tradition, genocide.
[01:06:54.517 --> 01:06:58.240]  Well you're right that Elon Musk's dad was a big transhumanist and so was his grandfather.
[01:06:58.933 --> 01:07:01.375]  Well, he was like the head of the Transhumanist Society of Canada.
[01:07:01.876 --> 01:07:04.077]  So you're absolutely right that Musk is something else.
[01:07:05.679 --> 01:07:15.127]  Well, and he will have his Act 1, Act 2, Act 3, and put all the people into complacency.
[01:07:17.256 --> 01:07:20.319]  And so far it seems to be working pretty well, okay?
[01:07:20.459 --> 01:07:31.649]  And so, in terms of Fauci, I would have to say, to give him his credit, he is the world's most successful mass murderer to date, okay?
[01:07:31.689 --> 01:07:33.731]  He really does make Joseph Mengele blush.
[01:07:34.292 --> 01:07:35.013]  Thank you for the call.
[01:07:35.273 --> 01:07:37.114]  Let's put Elon Musk's mom back on screen.
[01:07:37.715 --> 01:07:41.739]  She's a quote, model, and it's all very, uh...
[01:07:43.956 --> 01:07:47.878]  Very dark, very occultic, very twisted stuff.
[01:07:47.918 --> 01:07:49.819]  So there's definitely something to all of this.
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:59.885]  And I'm actually honored to have Elon Musk come out and say he's holier than thou and I'm the devil while he has all these slave cobalt mines and everything else because I question mass shooting.
[01:07:59.925 --> 01:08:04.788]  I mean, if I've got somebody like Elon Musk saying I'm the bad guy, I must be pretty good.
[01:08:06.229 --> 01:08:07.810]  It just gets crazier and crazier.
[01:08:08.130 --> 01:08:09.671]  And I don't want to make an enemy of Elon Musk.
[01:08:09.731 --> 01:08:11.552]  I mean, I wish we could turn this around.
[01:08:14.121 --> 01:08:16.001]  It'd be better for the globalists to stop doing what they're doing.
[01:08:16.882 --> 01:08:19.322]  But we'll see what happens.
[01:08:19.342 --> 01:08:20.643]  We'll be right back with more of your calls.
[01:08:20.723 --> 01:08:21.323]  Stay with us.
[01:08:22.203 --> 01:08:25.604]  So here's my best thinking, and I'll go back to your calls and what's really going on.
[01:08:26.564 --> 01:08:28.524]  There are two different schools of thought.
[01:08:28.684 --> 01:08:30.585]  A renaissance pro-human expansion.
[01:08:31.225 --> 01:08:33.366]  The universe is ours just like the earth is ours.
[01:08:33.426 --> 01:08:33.866]  Genesis 2.0.
[01:08:35.446 --> 01:08:43.448]  And if there's a huge population boom, it'll force stresses on humanity that make us basically innovate and go to the next level.
[01:08:44.372 --> 01:08:53.837]  And Elon's acting like he wants to go to Mars and have a pro-human future, he should have more kids, you shouldn't depopulate, beware the AI gods, beware the New World Order, you know, beware the tyrants.
[01:08:55.818 --> 01:08:59.981]  But then at every level what he does is the very heart of the New World Order.
[01:09:02.442 --> 01:09:03.603]  While he speaks out against it.
[01:09:03.683 --> 01:09:05.544]  So you gotta sit back and ask, what is that?
[01:09:06.444 --> 01:09:10.446]  And obviously he's their man, he's their champion, he's the devil's champion.
[01:09:10.867 --> 01:09:12.648]  In his own words, out there doing that.
[01:09:13.618 --> 01:09:15.439]  And that's so they can control the discourse.
[01:09:16.179 --> 01:09:33.124]  Because there's another movement, if you translate it out, the devil's a fallen angel, a fallen entity, it says, merge with me, become a god, Garden of Eden, get rid of the rest of the humans, you don't want their competition, you must prove you're the superman, the uber-mention, by exterminating all the lesser ones.
[01:09:33.824 --> 01:09:38.506]  And that's really what the Satanism and the selfishness and the power and the control is all about.
[01:09:41.027 --> 01:09:50.077]  And so Elon is riding the fence trying to be the king of both kingdoms in some Illuminati synthesis, basically, or balance.
[01:09:50.578 --> 01:09:52.360]  And they tell you in their movies, it's like Darth Vader.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.823]  He's meant to bring balance to the force, defeat the Sith.
[01:09:55.123 --> 01:09:59.108]  But really, he defeats the Jedi and the Sith and destroys the old existing Stagnant Order.
[01:10:01.127 --> 01:10:04.330]  And so, Elon Musk thinks he's Anika Skywalker.
[01:10:05.131 --> 01:10:07.493]  I mean, that's really in the Illuminati's stratagem.
[01:10:08.213 --> 01:10:09.675]  That's what he thinks he is.
[01:10:09.955 --> 01:10:11.737]  And so, I don't even need to ask the callers.
[01:10:11.757 --> 01:10:12.397]  The callers are great.
[01:10:12.417 --> 01:10:13.238]  You're bringing up great points.
[01:10:13.478 --> 01:10:14.299]  We'll get your take on it.
[01:10:14.319 --> 01:10:15.060]  But really, that's it.
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:15.900]  We all know what it is.
[01:10:17.041 --> 01:10:23.647]  I am just insanely honored that the Devil's Champion says I am the most evil person on Earth.
[01:10:24.528 --> 01:10:30.596]   And the Devil's Viceroy Albert Bourla says, I'm an agent of evil and the most evil man on earth.
[01:10:31.016 --> 01:10:32.537]  Why is Albert Bourla?
[01:10:33.437 --> 01:10:36.058]  Why is the ADL?
[01:10:36.078 --> 01:10:41.359]  Why is Elon Musk saying, I am the worst person on earth?
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:44.840]  Truth is, I'm not, folks.
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:45.441]  I love God.
[01:10:45.481 --> 01:10:46.061]  I love justice.
[01:10:46.121 --> 01:10:46.701]  I love children.
[01:10:47.021 --> 01:10:47.481]  I love you.
[01:10:47.501 --> 01:10:48.261]  I love strength.
[01:10:48.662 --> 01:10:49.222]  I love life.
[01:10:49.682 --> 01:10:51.522]  And I am not an angel.
[01:10:52.003 --> 01:10:56.444]  I am not godlike, but I love God and I try to follow God.
[01:11:00.214 --> 01:11:02.876]  I'm not an intervention, I'm just a man like my ancestors.
[01:11:04.678 --> 01:11:05.718]  I'm not a superman.
[01:11:05.738 --> 01:11:09.902]  I made the image of God though that makes me beyond that, but only through God.
[01:11:12.103 --> 01:11:14.285]  So there we've answered the question of Elon Musk, I think.
[01:11:16.387 --> 01:11:20.750]  I don't want to judge the soul, only God does that, and he without sin let him cast the first stone.
[01:11:22.551 --> 01:11:40.476]   But to tell me I should tie a millstone around my neck, that I'm a persecutor of children, When Elon Musk owns those cobalt mines where thousands of children have died in those horrible conditions, I've never killed one child, Elon, other than my unborn.
[01:11:40.977 --> 01:11:45.940]  And when I funded those abortions when I was a teenager, I repented later and didn't know what I was doing, and God has forgiven me.
[01:11:46.201 --> 01:11:46.901]  I'm not proud of it.
[01:11:47.181 --> 01:11:48.782]  I think that's why I explained it on air.
[01:11:50.544 --> 01:11:52.685]  That I'm a sinner and you can always come back from that.
[01:11:55.207 --> 01:11:57.689]  And I pay by not having those amazing humans in my life.
[01:11:58.905 --> 01:12:05.507]  And it's a real point of darkness in my life.
[01:12:10.068 --> 01:12:12.289]  So, no more free ride to Elon Musk.
[01:12:13.409 --> 01:12:16.350]  He wants to sit up there and act like he's Jesus and quote Jesus?
[01:12:16.730 --> 01:12:18.491]  Then you better start acting like it, buddy.
[01:12:21.104 --> 01:12:27.066]  How about you come out and say you believe in Jesus Christ and you repent and you want to receive the Holy Spirit and be born again?
[01:12:27.807 --> 01:12:29.507]  Or don't you quote Jesus Christ?
[01:12:29.768 --> 01:12:34.850]  Because the Bible tells us Satan masquerades as an angel of light and Satan quotes scripture.
[01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:49.916]  But if you are a prototype of the Antichrist, as you wish you were, it's obvious, then know this, God will break you and you were defeated from the foundations of earth and the devil's champion is a loser.
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:58.403]  SG, your 5G activist from Rhode Island, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:12:59.864 --> 01:13:02.786]  Hey Alex, it's an honor, but I'll skip the pleasantries.
[01:13:02.886 --> 01:13:20.930]   So a little bit of a background, I converted like a Kawasaki Ninja motorcycle to be electric a couple years ago, and there's really a great community of like people, you know, making open source kind of electric vehicles off of golf car parts and there's some
[01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:25.350]   companies that make you know unique stuff, but I'm always really not like Tesla because
[01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:32.010]   There's a couple of things Everyone's talking about BMW or Mercedes doing a DLC unlock
[01:13:32.010 --> 01:13:36.789]   to make your car go faster He's been doing that for a while Tesla
[01:13:37.662 --> 01:13:43.925]  They had one instance where basically you could pay to unlock battery capacity on your car.
[01:13:44.425 --> 01:13:47.607]  So like, they found out it would be cheaper to make one battery pack.
[01:13:48.127 --> 01:13:57.272]  So you'd buy the cheaper, less capacity battery on paper, but really you have the same battery and you could pay like $2,000 to unlock it.
[01:13:57.292 --> 01:13:59.313]  That's right, that's a very deceptive fraud.
[01:14:00.339 --> 01:14:00.519]  Yep.
[01:14:00.959 --> 01:14:10.946]  And then another thing is, you know, being with the DIY EV community, there's been instances of people where they'll buy like a salvaged Tesla that just has body damage.
[01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:17.291]  They would do all the repairs, and then they find out it's been bricked remotely when they bought it.
[01:14:17.693 --> 01:14:24.092]   and that they have to take it, you know, in some cases, three states over to a Tesla dealership and pay them.
[01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:31.393]   Oh, it's got all the AI, pre-programming, social credit score, societal straitjacket systems in it.
[01:14:31.393 --> 01:14:37.193]   So if you judge a tree by its fruits, his mouth says a lot of good things, but what he actually creates is evil.
[01:14:37.193 --> 01:14:45.092]   Yes, 100%. And going to Neuralink, like, I'm really afraid of that because, you know, we don't have AI.
[01:14:45.126 --> 01:14:46.148]  It's all machine learning.
[01:14:46.188 --> 01:14:49.034]  It's all code looking at pictures and patterns.
[01:14:49.715 --> 01:15:05.108]   If, you know, millions of people get a brain chip, That's like monitoring their brainwaves in real time, and then that stuff gets all put into a server, you know, I think they could make, you know, kind of like a demonic AI based off of people's brainwaves, the amalgamation of all that.
[01:15:05.128 --> 01:15:05.828]  Well that's it.
[01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:12.050]  The robots won't really be human, but they'll model so many brainwaves and actions, they'll be able to mimic humans, even mimic our voice.
[01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:17.733]  Which is their next big scam to say, oh, your father or mother died, but they uploaded to a machine first.
[01:15:18.113 --> 01:15:21.415]  And so this is your mom and dad really lives on, but it's a facsimile.
[01:15:21.495 --> 01:15:22.856]  It's not really them.
[01:15:23.176 --> 01:15:23.896]  Great point, sir.
[01:15:23.956 --> 01:15:24.577]  God bless you.
[01:15:25.277 --> 01:15:26.798]  Let's go to Zach in California.
[01:15:26.898 --> 01:15:27.739]  Zach, you're on the air.
[01:15:27.759 --> 01:15:30.000]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:30.780]  I'm alright, brother.
[01:15:32.541 --> 01:15:40.146]  Um, I just, um, you know, as far as Elon Musk, I just wanted to say that, um, I actually think he's a rather, he doesn't know what he bought Twitter.
[01:15:40.186 --> 01:15:42.087]  He doesn't know what he was getting into, in my opinion.
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:48.683]  And he failed the litmus test of unbanning you.
[01:15:49.104 --> 01:15:54.807]  I know you don't want to be unbanned unless it's a free speech platform.
[01:15:55.287 --> 01:15:56.748]  Well sure, I don't want to make it about me.
[01:15:56.908 --> 01:15:57.909]  They made it about me.
[01:15:57.969 --> 01:15:59.330]  The point is, is that...
[01:16:01.503 --> 01:16:06.703]   Is that we're having a debate about Elon Musk and the listeners thought I was too easy on him.
[01:16:06.703 --> 01:16:10.703]   I wanted to see him do all these good things and I'll be honest, he's doing a bunch of good stuff.
[01:16:10.703 --> 01:16:14.543]   It's just the end of the day, we need to really have a discussion about this guy
[01:16:14.543 --> 01:16:16.543]  because he's at the heart of the new world order.
[01:16:16.543 --> 01:16:17.823]  All right.
[01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:27.264]   Yeah, he, I think him, I think he's thinking both sides of his mouth, you know.
[01:16:27.490 --> 01:16:32.873]  He's quoting, making Bible quotes and addressing him like the devil that's, you know.
[01:16:33.033 --> 01:16:33.413]  No, I agree.
[01:16:33.433 --> 01:16:40.657]  We know he's talking out of both sides of his mouth, but do we think he's a conscious devil's champion, or is he just a fool?
[01:16:40.957 --> 01:16:41.957]  And I don't think he's a fool.
[01:16:42.778 --> 01:16:47.220]  I think Elon Musk might be the most evil man on Earth right now.
[01:16:50.549 --> 01:16:52.451]  Yeah, I believe that.
[01:16:52.651 --> 01:16:57.137]  I cannot get behind that.
[01:16:57.157 --> 01:17:05.666]  I don't think that Twitter, as long as he's playing, I think he is playing both sides at the same time.
[01:17:07.548 --> 01:17:07.809]  Maybe.
[01:17:07.829 --> 01:17:10.592]  Well, we know he's playing both sides.
[01:17:10.612 --> 01:17:14.198]   The question is, Is he doing that to fool the globalists to beat him?
[01:17:14.258 --> 01:17:16.419]  Or is he doing that to fool us and beat us and beat the globalists?
[01:17:16.779 --> 01:17:18.399]  Because the globalists all want to take each other over.
[01:17:18.519 --> 01:17:21.080]  I mean, is he the super predator playing both sides?
[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:23.260]  And I think more and more he's moving into that category.
[01:17:26.461 --> 01:17:27.801]  I think he is.
[01:17:27.821 --> 01:17:30.082]  I think he is, absolutely.
[01:17:31.342 --> 01:17:32.923]  Alright, Zach, thank you.
[01:17:33.683 --> 01:17:43.978]   Ahmed, Robert, Jacob, Josh, George, Berman, Keith, Steve, Jeff, John, stay with us.

[01:17:46.159 --> 01:17:47.420]  I can tell you this is the real deal.
[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:49.161]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:17:49.181 --> 01:17:50.602]  We're going right back to your phone calls.
[01:17:51.262 --> 01:17:52.703]  I was talking to Scott, the producer.
[01:17:52.723 --> 01:17:54.484]  He's really a smart guy and he has his own talk show.
[01:17:54.504 --> 01:17:57.886]  He doesn't want one, though, but we may make him do it.
[01:17:59.247 --> 01:18:00.388]  I said, what do you think, Elon Musk?
[01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:38.844]   He says he's an opportunist based in the freest country in the world, taking over the satellites, taking over the cars, taking over energy, taking over the brain, taking over the internet, who basically talks this big game, but at the end of the day, the globalists currently couldn't even take him off the internet because he's got his own satellites, his own infrastructure, and he's basically one of their own types in a hostile takeover of their own system, because it is a bunch of addled, brain-dead, Henry Kissinger types that are still in control and Elon Musk is just marching in and taking over from them while claiming he's against them.
[01:18:39.325 --> 01:18:41.346]  It's just meet the new boss same as the old boss.
[01:18:41.707 --> 01:18:42.647]  Won't get fooled again.
[01:18:42.667 --> 01:18:45.150]  And I think that's basically what it comes down to.
[01:18:45.170 --> 01:18:51.275]  But we should have this Elon Musk discussion because he was allowed to take over Tesla.
[01:18:51.295 --> 01:18:52.876]  He was allowed to get the government funding.
[01:18:53.216 --> 01:18:55.378]  He was allowed to take over much of NASA's missions.
[01:18:55.798 --> 01:19:02.580]   He's been allowed at every front to do what he's doing Well, the power structure acts like they don't like him.
[01:19:03.921 --> 01:19:05.961]  But at the end of the day, he is the power structure.
[01:19:06.582 --> 01:19:08.522]  And so I'm not going after Musk because he's attacking me.
[01:19:08.582 --> 01:19:14.485]  I mean, I think this is a really pregnant question now that needs to be dealt with.
[01:19:15.425 --> 01:19:18.427]  But I love the fact he's going to expose government control of Twitter previously.
[01:19:18.927 --> 01:19:22.428]  And he's cutting back, cutting back on the pedophilia on Twitter.
[01:19:22.808 --> 01:19:23.909]  I mean, those are good things.
[01:19:26.118 --> 01:19:27.399]  Those are good things he's doing.
[01:19:28.179 --> 01:19:30.700]  But in between everything else, it's a real enigma.
[01:19:31.441 --> 01:19:32.621]  So let's go back to your calls.
[01:19:32.781 --> 01:19:35.002]  Ahmed in New York, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[01:19:36.003 --> 01:19:37.564]  General Jones, salute!
[01:19:37.924 --> 01:19:38.644]  What's going on?
[01:19:38.784 --> 01:19:39.845]  God bless you, what's on your mind?
[01:19:40.393 --> 01:19:41.414]  God bless you too brother.
[01:19:41.594 --> 01:19:45.178]  I just was calling because it's time to sign up the enemy.
[01:19:45.218 --> 01:19:48.441]  The enemy's been signing up us for God knows how long.
[01:19:48.542 --> 01:19:50.003]  It's time to sign up the enemy.
[01:19:50.023 --> 01:19:55.289]  I want to relate this to also like to the Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.
[01:19:55.549 --> 01:20:09.815]   They were playing with each other like how they're not In the offseason they were playing with the media because the media was attacking them because of what happened with the vaccine mandates with Kyrie and Kevin Durant defending Kyrie and they saw how much fire and scrutiny they were under.
[01:20:10.155 --> 01:20:17.557]  So in the offseason they were playing the media saying that we're not going to be on the same team, we don't like each other, I'm going to go play with LeBron, blah blah blah.
[01:20:17.837 --> 01:20:20.238]  So I'm looking at this in a grand scale.
[01:20:20.605 --> 01:20:23.605]  as the same thing as Trump making the vaccines.
[01:20:23.605 --> 01:20:27.944]   If it wasn't for him making the vaccines, he hijacked the movement because it would have been Bill
[01:20:27.944 --> 01:20:29.565]  Gates and his vaccines.
[01:20:29.565 --> 01:20:37.155]   So I look at this as Elon Musk playing not with you, but playing with the psyops, the people that create these psyops
[01:20:37.155 --> 01:20:38.164]  on the public.
[01:20:38.164 --> 01:20:42.525]   It's not that he doesn't like you, it's just that if he befriends you,
[01:20:42.525 --> 01:20:47.124]   Twitter is gonna be taken off, Apple Store, just like your app was taken off
[01:20:47.124 --> 01:20:52.045]   of all the platforms, which is a disgrace, honestly, to free speech.
[01:20:52.784 --> 01:20:59.104]   Another thing is it's a god. It's a blessing for you because band our video is powerful as ever and honestly
[01:20:59.104 --> 01:21:04.564]   Band our video is kicks the crab out of YouTube any day and rumble and any other place
[01:21:04.564 --> 01:21:07.764]   Because this is where you get your information. This is where you stream out
[01:21:07.764 --> 01:21:11.925]   This is where you rely on yourself lean on yourself and your self-dependent self-reliance
[01:21:11.925 --> 01:21:17.894]   And that's what it's all about is being self-dependent self-reliance So we have to create our own Renaissance and I feel like
[01:21:17.894 --> 01:21:24.045]   Elon Musk is pushing off against you Because he doesn't want all the heat on Twitter free speech
[01:21:24.045 --> 01:21:29.434]   child pornography That's on Twitter and he also accessed all the data the
[01:21:29.434 --> 01:21:37.995]   last how old is Twitter He owns all the data that they've been messaging back and forth with all the child human trafficking.
[01:21:38.035 --> 01:21:38.535]  Oh, you're right.
[01:21:38.595 --> 01:21:43.056]  It's major leverage, or you call it blackmail, against the deep state.
[01:21:43.096 --> 01:21:44.697]  That's a great point.
[01:21:44.717 --> 01:21:50.579]  Well, there's no doubt he was under pressure for not censoring more, so he just threw me to the wolves as a way to get out of that.
[01:21:50.599 --> 01:21:51.519]  I mean, that's clear.
[01:21:51.539 --> 01:21:52.740]  That's not debatable.
[01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:56.062]  It's just I was having a larger discussion, but you make some great points.
[01:21:56.102 --> 01:21:56.842]  God bless you, sir.
[01:21:57.282 --> 01:21:58.163]  Really powerful caller.
[01:21:58.763 --> 01:22:00.765]  Brian in Kansas, you're on the air.
[01:22:00.785 --> 01:22:02.866]  Hi, can you hear me?
[01:22:03.046 --> 01:22:03.346]  Yes, sir.
[01:22:04.307 --> 01:22:36.194]   Yeah, I think it's the hostile takeover approach that your producer said, but there's a lot of people like Kanye West, Trump, that I don't fully trust, that I want to trust and think they mean well, or they're less evil than the previous people, but I'm always worried about mind control and blackmail and But more so than that, it's like everything comes down to mind control, or David Icke talked about psychs running the operation, and there's always powerful doctors or psychiatrists behind celebrities and powerful people.
[01:22:37.095 --> 01:22:44.518]  Absolutely, look, I know Kanye West very well, I'll leave it at that, and nobody's controlling that guy.
[01:22:45.098 --> 01:22:51.241]  Doesn't mean I agree with anything he's saying either, but when it comes to a lot of these other people, that's definitely going on.
[01:22:52.250 --> 01:23:04.241]   And I feel like they're trying to do that on the individuals and get control of the opinion leaders like Bernie Spears and I felt like One person you were wrong about, but I think you might have changed course with Michael Jackson.
[01:23:04.701 --> 01:23:07.182]  I think that's an interesting piece of the overall equation.
[01:23:07.202 --> 01:23:09.243]  Yeah, well they never proved he was having sex with kids.
[01:23:09.303 --> 01:23:11.143]  He'd definitely been abused by his father.
[01:23:11.583 --> 01:23:12.324]  That's on record.
[01:23:12.384 --> 01:23:16.145]  And so he was arrested development, like a child that wanted to be around children.
[01:23:16.465 --> 01:23:17.745]  They never, he was a drug addict.
[01:23:17.765 --> 01:23:19.026]  They put him on drugs to control him.
[01:23:19.366 --> 01:23:20.226]  There's no evidence.
[01:23:21.026 --> 01:23:21.547]  And you're right.
[01:23:22.047 --> 01:23:24.387]  Decades ago, I said Jackson looks like a pedophile.
[01:23:24.708 --> 01:23:27.568]  But the more I studied the story, he was abused.
[01:23:27.588 --> 01:23:29.089]  There was no evidence he ever abused children.
[01:23:29.744 --> 01:23:40.887]  Yeah, I was in the courtroom in 2005 and knew people involved, and it was completely the first character assassination fraud by the media, and it's what they replicated on Donald Trump.
[01:23:41.027 --> 01:23:42.588]  Brother, you ain't gotta tell me that.
[01:23:42.988 --> 01:23:50.250]  They sent me, right after they sued me, or some group did, hidden child porn embedded in emails.
[01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:51.451]  We never opened it.
[01:23:51.511 --> 01:23:55.832]  They sued us, demanded those emails, then found the hidden stuff and said, I sent it to them.
[01:23:56.545 --> 01:23:59.787]  Yeah, he was the ultimate scapegoat for Hollywood and all the other people.
[01:24:00.347 --> 01:24:05.831]  All the young people that were in Hollywood were going to him for comfort and to confide in about who the real pedophiles were.
[01:24:06.431 --> 01:24:08.192]  And everybody fell for it, unfortunately.
[01:24:08.212 --> 01:24:10.434]  But I'm glad you understand now.
[01:24:11.826 --> 01:24:15.432]  Well, I mean, I think the jury, I'd say the jury's still out on Jackson.
[01:24:15.452 --> 01:24:17.435]  They never proved anything to Sex With Kids.
[01:24:17.856 --> 01:24:18.737]  Definitely screwed up.
[01:24:19.098 --> 01:24:20.620]  Definitely had the brain of an eight-year-old.
[01:24:20.741 --> 01:24:21.582]  Incredible talent.
[01:24:21.782 --> 01:24:23.145]  Genius at music and stuff.
[01:24:23.665 --> 01:24:24.767]  I love Michael Jackson's music.
[01:24:25.028 --> 01:24:26.009]  The point is, is that...
[01:24:27.014 --> 01:24:29.936]  He was definitely, you hear those recordings people sing, he looked like a little kid.
[01:24:30.516 --> 01:24:32.778]  I mean, that guy was raped, beaten, hardcore.
[01:24:33.598 --> 01:24:37.961]  All the songs he was singing as a little kid out there, behind the scenes he was being tortured, that's admitted.
[01:24:37.981 --> 01:24:39.942]  Alright, God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[01:24:40.663 --> 01:24:41.723]  Jeff in Canada is up next.
[01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:43.364]  Let me just say this very briefly.

[01:25:24.973 --> 01:25:26.154]  Lower shipping prices.
[01:25:26.174 --> 01:25:27.375]  A lot of stuff's about to happen.
[01:25:27.875 --> 01:25:29.756]  But to do that, we've got to get leaner and meaner.
[01:25:29.816 --> 01:25:32.237]  So all this classic stuff is gone.
[01:25:32.758 --> 01:25:33.778]  Gone tonight at midnight.

[01:25:40.022 --> 01:25:40.582]  Thanks for calling.
[01:25:41.972 --> 01:25:43.792]  Alex, I just want to say first that I love you.
[01:25:43.812 --> 01:25:45.013]  I love InfoWars.
[01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:46.373]  I pray for you guys every day.
[01:25:46.393 --> 01:25:47.473]  I pray for your supporters.
[01:25:49.034 --> 01:25:53.135]  So I just, before I make my point about Elon Musk, I want to make two quick points.
[01:25:53.515 --> 01:26:00.316]  One, when they came out with that ridiculous 1.25 trillion dollar judgment against you, or it was advertised as that.
[01:26:00.336 --> 01:26:00.696]  It's actually 1.44.
[01:26:03.997 --> 01:26:14.581]  Yeah, I wanted to say that I was going to suggest that you do some kind of a press conference and offer them a $100 trillion Zimbabwe note and ask them for change.
[01:26:14.601 --> 01:26:15.041]  You know what?
[01:26:15.181 --> 01:26:17.702]  I thought of the same thing and I had some around the office.
[01:26:17.742 --> 01:26:18.962]  Guys, reorder online.
[01:26:18.982 --> 01:26:21.123]  They're expensive now to actually get them.
[01:26:21.403 --> 01:26:22.703]  Get me like a $20 trillion Zimbabwe note.
[01:26:24.384 --> 01:26:25.826]  And I'll say, hey, you can keep the change.
[01:26:25.886 --> 01:26:29.369]  And it's not to make a joke about it, but they did that to sigh off our audience.
[01:26:29.389 --> 01:26:30.510]  Like, it must be over.
[01:26:30.811 --> 01:26:34.855]  He owes $1.44 trillion, or $1.44 billion.
[01:26:35.075 --> 01:26:35.896]  They asked for trillions.
[01:26:36.376 --> 01:26:37.277]  And it's just insane.
[01:26:37.337 --> 01:26:38.078]  It means nothing.
[01:26:38.198 --> 01:26:39.099]  We're in bankruptcy.
[01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:41.561]  The money you buy products doesn't go to them.
[01:26:41.582 --> 01:26:42.583]  We're appealing it for years.
[01:26:43.223 --> 01:26:45.804]  So a lot of listeners are like, I'm not going to buy a product anymore, it goes to them.
[01:26:46.304 --> 01:26:47.524]  None of the money goes to them.
[01:26:47.784 --> 01:26:49.345]  We're in a two-year appeal process.
[01:26:49.725 --> 01:26:50.605]  We're in bankruptcy.
[01:26:50.625 --> 01:26:57.467]  If we make it through that and then we lose the appeals, then in a couple years, a percentage of profit will go to them.
[01:26:57.807 --> 01:27:00.008]  But that's like a million years away, folks.
[01:27:00.288 --> 01:27:02.548]  We need funding now to fight them to go to the appeal.
[01:27:02.769 --> 01:27:07.190]  Notice they say, oh, we don't want the money, just shut him down, because they know they're going to lose on appeal.
[01:27:07.210 --> 01:27:07.670]  Do you understand?
[01:27:12.307 --> 01:27:17.832]  I don't want to cut you off.
[01:27:17.872 --> 01:27:18.633]  Don't hang up, Jeff.
[01:27:19.534 --> 01:27:20.174]  I'm going to go to break.
[01:27:20.755 --> 01:27:23.517]  I'm going to come right back to you in two minutes, and then we have a very special guest.
[01:27:24.378 --> 01:27:30.464]  I tried to get the crew to hire her a couple years ago because I could tell she's a great reporter, and just somehow it never happened.
[01:27:31.064 --> 01:27:31.745]  But hey, it doesn't matter.
[01:27:31.765 --> 01:27:35.709]  She's on OAN and knocking it out of the park, and the left hates our guts.
[01:27:37.125 --> 01:27:38.666]  Because she's got beauty and brains.
[01:27:38.686 --> 01:27:40.327]  We've got a very special guest coming up.
[01:27:40.907 --> 01:27:41.828]  After the call, stay with us.
[01:27:42.789 --> 01:27:45.510]  OAN reporter Allison Steinberg joining us.
[01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:47.892]  The most controversial lady on their great channel.
[01:27:49.112 --> 01:27:50.293]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[01:27:50.313 --> 01:27:51.914]  We'll continue with your calls once she's on with us.
[01:27:52.455 --> 01:27:54.916]  Jevin Kennedy called in about Elon Musk and SpaceX.
[01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:56.197]  I want to hear about that.
[01:27:56.217 --> 01:27:56.837]  Give us your take.
[01:27:58.398 --> 01:27:58.939]  Hi Alex.
[01:27:58.999 --> 01:28:03.421]  Yeah, so I wanted to say that SpaceX is basically, it's a military industrial complex.
[01:28:03.822 --> 01:28:17.169]   It takes billions of dollars for the Department of Defense I believe he's controlled opposition, a limited hangout, his whole family comes from, you know, transhumanism, aristocracy, and like you said, it's all been allowed.
[01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:22.173]  So I think Elon Musk is, I think he's a deceiver.
[01:28:22.693 --> 01:28:26.636]  So what is the point of him taking over Twitter and actually doing a lot of good things?
[01:28:26.676 --> 01:28:27.817]  Just to earn the street cred?
[01:28:28.693 --> 01:28:29.574]  Absolutely, yeah.
[01:28:29.654 --> 01:28:34.999]  And you said, I think, maybe 10 years ago... Because they need to build the mega-world web that counters China in his own word.
[01:28:35.479 --> 01:28:39.803]  InternetX, act like it's free, get us all on board, pull the rug out from under our feet.
[01:28:41.505 --> 01:28:41.745]  Right.
[01:28:42.365 --> 01:28:45.168]  So anyway, I want to make one more point.
[01:28:45.208 --> 01:28:50.573]  You always say that you'll own nothing and you'll have nothing, but I think more importantly, they say that you'll have no privacy.
[01:28:51.664 --> 01:28:57.545]  And the privacy aspect of it is, so you'll own nothing is not having any property.
[01:28:57.905 --> 01:29:03.106]  But more importantly, not having any privacy is how they prevent you from ever having any property again.
[01:29:03.186 --> 01:29:06.187]  And without property, we can never challenge their power again.
[01:29:06.447 --> 01:29:06.767]  That's right.
[01:29:06.787 --> 01:29:12.048]  You can never organize your own business, your own system, anything that starts forming that is in competition to them.
[01:29:12.068 --> 01:29:13.368]  These regulators are shut down.
[01:29:13.768 --> 01:29:16.669]  That's what the censorship really is, is surveillance.
[01:29:17.489 --> 01:29:18.290]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:22.590]   censorship, censorship and surveillance. And you saw the press secretary, I played it first
[01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:27.430]   hour, she goes, "We've got to watch everyone closer and not let them involve in hate speech."
[01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:33.110]   So it's really the rolling out of the surveillance state that's already there, it's the legitimizing
[01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:37.789]   of it. Great points, thank you Jeff. Alright, Steve in Nevada, thanks for calling.
[01:29:37.789 --> 01:29:39.870]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:40.870]  Good brother.
[01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:45.070]   Great, I'm just sitting here starting my day with some Wake Up America coffee, souped up
[01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:46.070]  with a little espresso.
[01:29:46.964 --> 01:29:49.565]  Anyway, I'm out here in the beautiful state of Nevada.
[01:29:50.346 --> 01:29:52.287]  Anyway, you wanted to talk about Elon Musk?
[01:29:52.307 --> 01:29:55.289]  I don't want to talk about Michael Jackson, let's talk about Elon Musk.
[01:29:56.410 --> 01:30:07.417]  Elon Musk, do we really know more than... Okay, I saw him on Joe Rogan a few years ago, talking about when he went to the White House to talk to Obama.
[01:30:08.115 --> 01:30:08.335]  No.
[01:30:08.935 --> 01:30:11.456]  And he said Obama didn't want to talk nothing about AI.
[01:30:12.016 --> 01:30:13.396]  Now, tell me something.
[01:30:14.756 --> 01:30:18.097]  Has Elon Musk... How many times has this guy been in the White House?
[01:30:18.397 --> 01:30:20.017]  How many presidents has he gone through?
[01:30:20.077 --> 01:30:21.557]  It doesn't matter who the president is.
[01:30:21.977 --> 01:30:24.018]  They give this guy money to do things, right?
[01:30:24.398 --> 01:30:24.638]  Yes.
[01:30:25.738 --> 01:30:26.038]  Okay.
[01:30:26.598 --> 01:30:30.939]  Now, that tells you right there, Elon Musk is in it for Elon Musk.
[01:30:30.959 --> 01:30:33.459]  And that means if they're giving him money, he's kicking it back to them.
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:34.900]  He is mobbed up.
[01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:36.080]  He is greenlit.
[01:30:37.395 --> 01:30:41.159]  Right, so, you know, I listened to what you wanted to talk about and I said, yeah, I like that.
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:49.128]  Now, this guy, his family got thrown out of Canada, right, for trying to start some, like, socialist communist party or something?
[01:30:49.288 --> 01:30:49.509]  Yes.
[01:30:50.498 --> 01:31:14.972]  Okay, now, that being said, has this guy, do we know if this guy has any ties to the Future World Leaders Program, like Tulsi Gabbard and Trump's daughter and Hillary Clinton's daughter and so many other people that you would say, I mean, you could believe Hillary Clinton's daughter, but I mean, I believe that a lot of people in our government are tied into this Future World Leaders Program, even if they're a minion.
[01:31:15.532 --> 01:31:18.065]   Now, what's Elon Musk No, I agree.
[01:31:18.105 --> 01:31:22.128]  He's backed by the heart of the power structure while claiming he's battling it.
[01:31:21.988 --> 01:31:26.747]   the New World Order and it's a tyrannical. I'm not buying that. I think
[01:31:26.747 --> 01:31:33.427]   that's a smoke screen and I think that this cat I have no respect for. You know
[01:31:33.427 --> 01:31:39.588]   I you know it seems like he gets all his money to build this. No, I agree. He's backed by the
[01:31:39.588 --> 01:31:43.748]   heart of the power structure while claiming he's battling and we should all
[01:31:43.748 --> 01:31:50.548]  watch our backs. Oh and by the way this X2 is phenomenal.
[01:31:48.566 --> 01:31:49.747]  I recommend it to everybody.
[01:31:50.087 --> 01:31:51.588]  I've been taking it for a couple years now.
[01:31:51.988 --> 01:31:54.790]  You gotta be careful with it, but man, it's good stuff.
[01:31:55.371 --> 01:31:57.672]  One more point here with Elon Musk.
[01:31:58.193 --> 01:32:05.958]  You know, a friend of mine turned me on to this girl that he had a kid with, Grimms or Grimes, her name is.
[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:08.620]  Are you familiar?
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:09.661]  Yeah, Big Devil Orsher.
[01:32:10.655 --> 01:32:11.536]  Yeah, yeah, right, right.
[01:32:11.736 --> 01:32:12.877]  That's what I'm getting from it.
[01:32:13.438 --> 01:32:32.118]  I'm a musician, and her music's pretty interesting, but the whole underlying tone of what's behind what I see with Elon Musk, after seeing him on Joe Rogan a couple years ago, I thought they were sitting there smoking cigars and drinking... We're out of time, brother.
[01:32:32.158 --> 01:32:32.598]  We gotta go.
[01:32:32.458 --> 01:32:46.458]  I'll call back again.
[01:32:46.913 --> 01:32:55.358]  Many of our top selling items are included in this sale and are in limited supply, so once they're out, they will probably not be back in stock until next year.
[01:32:55.738 --> 01:32:59.860]  Everything is listed at deep discounts of up to 60% off market price.
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:05.604]  Plus, if you order now, we will include a free gift from the store for every order, regardless of what you buy.
[01:33:06.204 --> 01:33:12.847]  This item will be chosen at random from a hand-picked selection of our DVDs, books, stickers, and so much more.
[01:33:13.287 --> 01:33:18.109]  This is our gift to you for supporting the InfoWars and the Voice of Freedom worldwide.
[01:33:18.449 --> 01:33:29.213]  After the seemingly never-ending barrage of attacks on us, Alex and the rest of the crew here at InfoWars needs all the help we can get to allow the message of a pro-human future to reach the masses.
[01:33:29.713 --> 01:33:38.942]  Hurry to the store of InfoWars now to check out the mega blowout sale because some of these items are already selling out at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:33:40.063 --> 01:33:46.670]  And finally, another conspiracy theory proven to be true regarding COVID by none other than Bill Gates himself.
[01:33:47.568 --> 01:34:02.294]  It wasn't until early February when I was in a meeting that experts at the foundation said, there's no way, you know, this, there's been too much travel without diagnosis for us to contain this.
[01:34:02.974 --> 01:34:07.056]  And then at that point, we didn't really understand the fatality rate.
[01:34:07.216 --> 01:34:17.060]  You know, we didn't understand that it's a fairly low fatality rate and that it's a disease mainly of the elderly, kind of like flu is, although a bit different than that.
[01:34:18.345 --> 01:34:28.916]  Darn globalist Gates has only two years, a wrecked economy, and 225 million vaccines too late when he finally admits that maybe the panic and terror of COVID-19 was not warranted.
[01:34:28.936 --> 01:34:30.717]  And we're just supposed to accept that?
[01:34:30.737 --> 01:34:33.400]  And we're just supposed to, you know, let it all go?
[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:39.606]  That the smartest people, the best doctors, and the most intelligent scientists had nothing to do with any of this?
[01:34:40.507 --> 01:34:55.119]  If I, Malibu conspiracy theorist Barbie, put all of this together at the start of COVID using my own eyes and ears and just a little bit of common sense, why did it take Bill Gates, who is supposedly much smarter than I, two years to come to the same conclusion?
[01:34:55.899 --> 01:35:02.785]  Well, the answer is because Globalist Gates and all of his elite friends are far more demonic and sinister than any conspiracy theorist.
[01:35:03.246 --> 01:35:07.409]  At the end of the day, conspiracy theorists, or realists, just want to be told the truth.
[01:35:07.810 --> 01:35:09.091]  We're searching for real answers.
[01:35:09.531 --> 01:35:16.057]  Can you blame us for considering that it benefits elite establishment members to only give their version of the truth?
[01:35:16.697 --> 01:35:20.521]  And the narratives they go along with are the ones that generate the most profit.
[01:35:21.081 --> 01:35:30.889]  As the corporate media conglomerate NBC just ran a story encouraging parents to keep vaccinating their kids, even sharing this graphic that advises them to stay away from unvaccinated people.
[01:35:31.730 --> 01:35:34.072]  Will the insanity and mind games never end?
[01:35:34.572 --> 01:35:38.616]  Guys, we already established the vaccine doesn't stop anyone from transmitting COVID.
[01:35:39.116 --> 01:35:42.139]  So why is the mainstream media recycling outdated talking points?
[01:35:42.859 --> 01:35:47.265]  My guess is because they know they can keep scaring people and no one is going to say anything.
[01:35:47.885 --> 01:35:50.969]  That liberals outright love killing babies.
[01:35:51.570 --> 01:36:01.682]  Yes, between abortions, forced vaccinations at birth, formula shortages courtesy of Biden, it's no secret that these mentally deranged leftists are coming for your kids.
[01:36:02.423 --> 01:36:05.847]  We've been warning about it for years, only to be met with denial from the left.
[01:36:06.308 --> 01:36:12.415]  According to them, abortion is a constitutional right, and life doesn't begin until the child is out of the womb.
[01:36:12.976 --> 01:36:20.485]  They attempt to casually sweep their obsession with literally murdering children under the rug in the name of choice.
[01:36:21.326 --> 01:36:37.544]  On the off chance you're uncertain about the presence of evil and the capacity of its influence upon our society, if you still need proof that liberals are sick demons who thrive on the thought of death, boy do I have... If we continue to sit by idly and watch our nation crumble from the inside out.
[01:36:38.385 --> 01:36:41.467]  We used to have men that were both strong physically and mentally.
[01:36:41.807 --> 01:36:47.770]  Men who were willing to go to war and fight for our country to protect the freedoms that each and every one of us are so blessed to have.
[01:36:48.250 --> 01:36:48.670]  But now?
[01:36:49.290 --> 01:37:00.196]  Now we have a dwindling military with recruitment numbers lower than Joe Biden's approval rating, and a society full of low-testosterone soy boys that willingly muzzle themselves to drive alone in their cars.
[01:37:00.856 --> 01:37:15.495]  If we continue to bend the knee in an effort to appease the masses and bury our heads in the sand because we don't want to be political or ruffle any feathers, then we will continue to witness America and all of her beauty devolve into an unrecognizable state of destruction and devastation.
[01:37:18.237 --> 01:37:20.180]  Well that's just a few clips of Alison Steinberg.
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:21.101]  We've had her on as a guest.
[01:37:21.181 --> 01:37:23.064]  Owen has for years or so.
[01:37:23.144 --> 01:37:28.692]  I've had her on a few times and she's really doing a great job at One American News Network that's been under such attack.
[01:37:28.712 --> 01:37:31.856]  You can find her show daily at alisonatlarge.com.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:51.209]  And we're going to cover the waterfront here, so much to break down, the Balenciaga situation, Ye West, Trump, Twitter, Elon, free speech, Elon's refusal to reinstate yours truly, WEF, World ID, China revolts, what is really happening there, a battle of good versus evil, and so much more.
[01:37:51.249 --> 01:37:54.230]  We've got some big Balenciaga news that just broke.
[01:37:54.871 --> 01:37:58.413]  Turns out their parent company sells pedophile dolls.
[01:37:59.133 --> 01:38:00.794]  I don't even want to show these things on air.
[01:38:01.214 --> 01:38:02.715]  They're on InfoWars.com.
[01:38:03.096 --> 01:38:04.697]  The horror just gets worse and worse.
[01:38:05.297 --> 01:38:07.739]  Child sex stalls for pedophiles.
[01:38:08.459 --> 01:38:09.240]  And it gets worse.
[01:38:10.661 --> 01:38:11.862]  I don't know if we can even show this.
[01:38:12.702 --> 01:38:17.385]  Wow, Alison Steinberg, congratulations on being a grassroots reporter a few years ago.
[01:38:17.425 --> 01:38:27.392]  And now, I tell you, I mean, I watch a lot of OAN, a lot of great people there, but you're knocking it out of the park and you've gotten the globalists at the highest levels upset at you coming after you on a daily basis.
[01:38:27.412 --> 01:38:29.053]  So congratulations and great to have you here.
[01:38:29.073 --> 01:38:30.794]  You're going to be with us today.
[01:38:30.814 --> 01:38:31.715]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:38:31.795 --> 01:38:34.697]  It's truly an honor to be here and to have your support means the world.
[01:38:34.878 --> 01:38:36.259]  You are such an inspiration.
[01:38:36.539 --> 01:38:41.803]  You're doing such incredible work and it really means so much to me that you are so welcoming to have me back on your program.
[01:38:41.823 --> 01:38:43.104]  We love to have you all the time.
[01:38:43.204 --> 01:38:44.605]  So where do you want to start?
[01:38:44.625 --> 01:38:46.267]  What would you call the state of the world right now?
[01:38:46.627 --> 01:38:47.728]  The censorship, the attacks?
[01:38:47.828 --> 01:38:48.989]  You sent me a lot of great points.
[01:38:49.089 --> 01:38:52.111]  I sent you an email and said, please come on and tell us topics you want to hit.
[01:38:52.131 --> 01:38:53.873]  These are exactly the topics I would have wanted to hit.
[01:38:54.153 --> 01:38:55.214]  What do you want to dive into first?
[01:38:56.496 --> 01:39:02.218]  Well, I mean, you just talked about the breaking news on Balenciaga with the pedophile bears, a parent company that has that.
[01:39:02.278 --> 01:39:09.620]  I mean, I've been doing so much research on this Balenciaga saga that it seemingly is never ending and I haven't even heard about that one.
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:10.320]  It gets worse.
[01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:13.781]  It's not the pedo bears or the child porn documents.
[01:39:14.221 --> 01:39:17.122]  This is child-sized sex dolls.
[01:39:18.983 --> 01:39:20.163]  I mean... This just broke.
[01:39:20.183 --> 01:39:21.603]  It's a sad issue.
[01:39:21.663 --> 01:39:23.004]  Let's go back to Balenciaga.
[01:39:23.044 --> 01:39:23.744]  What do you make of that?
[01:39:25.029 --> 01:39:26.970]  It is just disturbing beyond belief.
[01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:38.034]  I just can't even believe it's real to know that so many high big name celebrities and so many different companies are involved with this is just it rattles me to my core.
[01:39:38.435 --> 01:39:43.016]  But with that being said, I think perhaps this is what we needed to happen to wake everyone up.
[01:39:43.317 --> 01:39:44.197]  I don't know why it took.
[01:39:44.617 --> 01:39:48.337]   this long but it seems like this is actually rattling some Democrats finally.
[01:39:48.337 --> 01:39:53.777]   I thought COVID would be the breaking point for everyone but apparently it wasn't.
[01:39:53.777 --> 01:39:57.417]   So maybe this is some way that can get through to the minds of the masses.
[01:39:57.417 --> 01:40:01.217]   You just drilled in the heart and I briefly said this last weekend but I meant to cover it more.
[01:40:01.217 --> 01:40:06.617]   For some reason this Balenciaga, bigger than Epstein, as big as it's...
[01:40:06.617 --> 01:40:09.417]  This somehow finally woke people up.
[01:40:09.417 --> 01:40:12.296]  Yes, it did and that's why it's so important.
[01:40:12.369 --> 01:40:25.800]  That's why we must, it's our job, you and me, Alex, to get to the bottom of this and find all the ties and all the connections and call out every single person that is responsible for perpetuating this and their involvement in this because this is how we get through to people.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:33.322]   For some reason, The masses worship these stupid celebrities who do nothing but get themselves involved in this mess.
[01:40:33.603 --> 01:40:35.823]  And it's time that we put an end to this.
[01:40:35.843 --> 01:40:37.943]  I mean, people need to wake up to what's really happening.
[01:40:38.203 --> 01:40:44.185]  We need to stop putting our faith into these worthless people who are all part of this evil cabal and get to the root of the problem.
[01:40:44.205 --> 01:40:45.385]  And I think that you and I can do that.
[01:40:45.405 --> 01:40:49.426]  I mean, it's a lot to uncover here, but I think we have a good start with everything going on.
[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:51.680]  I agree with you.
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:54.621]  Since you bring up Balenciaga, let's go ahead.
[01:40:54.741 --> 01:41:08.527]  Its parent company owns a production company that makes child-sized, anatomically correct children dolls of toddlers, little boys and girls up to age 10.
[01:41:09.067 --> 01:41:12.288]  And get this, they have human genitals for faces.
[01:41:14.091 --> 01:41:15.172]  Oh my goodness.
[01:41:16.514 --> 01:41:17.855]  I mean, where does it end?
[01:41:18.436 --> 01:41:20.759]  These people are just sick beyond belief.
[01:41:21.379 --> 01:41:27.346]  And it's not just these high up celebrities that we think that we're so distant from.
[01:41:27.406 --> 01:41:33.328]   It's people that are running our Districts, like Adam Schiff, he's involved with this.
[01:41:34.008 --> 01:41:44.475]  I don't know how much you know about the Standard Hotel, but there was one in West Hollywood, California, and he's got ties to this, all of these big-name celebrities, but it even trickles down to people running our cities.
[01:41:44.615 --> 01:41:52.241]  So I think there's a lot of deep diving that we need to do here, and there's a lot more than meets the eye, especially with this new news that you're just telling me about.
[01:41:52.281 --> 01:41:57.664]  I mean, I've seen some of these designers have heads of humans on their dinner tables.
[01:41:58.145 --> 01:42:01.367]   I mean, Kim Kardashian is just a straight demon.
[01:42:01.387 --> 01:42:05.591]  This mimics the book that was on the table, the Michael Borman's book.
[01:42:05.951 --> 01:42:08.353]  I mean, they're just telling you outright what they're doing.
[01:42:08.394 --> 01:42:09.495]  They're not secretive about it.
[01:42:09.515 --> 01:42:11.116]  They're not even trying to hide it.
[01:42:11.136 --> 01:42:18.863]  They want you to know, because that's part of their ritualistic, satanic cult-worshipping, is that they have to tell you what's going on.
[01:42:18.883 --> 01:42:20.584]  Well, that was my next question.
[01:42:20.624 --> 01:42:22.146]  Why are they coming out in the open right now?
[01:42:23.596 --> 01:42:30.661]  I think it's part of the satanic ritual that they've partaken to tell the people what they're doing.
[01:42:30.761 --> 01:42:37.285]  They can't get away with it by keeping it a secret, which they have done for many years, but they've dropped subtle hints in here and there.
[01:42:37.725 --> 01:42:43.328]  This time they're coming forward, they're being abundantly clear, and I think it's because our world is at a breaking point.
[01:42:44.329 --> 01:42:51.896]  There's so many different things happening between the war with Russia and Ukraine and COVID and China and all these things.
[01:42:51.956 --> 01:42:56.901]  I mean, it seems like we're kind of at a breaking point here in the end of the... It feels like the end of the world to me.
[01:42:56.941 --> 01:42:57.582]  I don't know about you.
[01:42:57.602 --> 01:42:58.683]  I think you probably agree.
[01:42:59.123 --> 01:43:02.486]  But I think it's, you know, they're coming out in full force.
[01:43:02.626 --> 01:43:06.029]  It's very clear that, you know, evil is very real.
[01:43:06.330 --> 01:43:07.691]  And they're just telling you because they have to.
[01:43:07.751 --> 01:43:10.034]   It's part of their I agree.
[01:43:10.174 --> 01:43:11.636]  Allison Steinberg, stay right there.
[01:43:11.676 --> 01:43:23.831]  I want to talk about the Twitter situation, Elon Musk, the WF, the China situation, and the war that OAN's been in as they've tried to shut you guys down when you guys exploded to the top of the charts the last few years.
[01:43:24.171 --> 01:43:26.394]  We'll be right back with Allison at large.
[01:43:26.414 --> 01:43:26.834]  Stay with us.
[01:43:27.495 --> 01:43:33.581]  Well, we got a real firecracker, a real firebrand, Allison Steinberg.
[01:43:34.121 --> 01:43:36.043]  Allison at large on the great OAN.
[01:43:36.844 --> 01:43:39.366]  And she's here with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:39.806 --> 01:43:44.891]  Been following her work for years when she was just an independent reporter on the street on Owen Schroer's show.
[01:43:45.552 --> 01:43:46.412]  And here she is.
[01:43:47.293 --> 01:43:48.554]  She's really got the elite's attention.
[01:43:48.574 --> 01:43:49.414]  They're really scared of her.
[01:43:49.455 --> 01:43:50.595]  That's why we love her even more.
[01:43:51.256 --> 01:43:53.217]  Let's talk about Elon Musk.
[01:43:53.277 --> 01:43:55.038]  What do you really think is going on with him?
[01:43:55.058 --> 01:44:05.225]  Doing a lot of great stuff, coming out saying they're going to expose government control of Twitter, going to stand up to communist China, going to support the protests, going to cut back on the pedophilias.
[01:44:05.245 --> 01:44:10.409]  Well, he's been trying that, but simultaneously coming out and demonizing myself and others.
[01:44:10.689 --> 01:44:15.112]  What's your women's intuition, but also just your analysis say about Elon Musk?
[01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:19.431]  Yeah, Alex, I would love to trust Elon.
[01:44:19.451 --> 01:44:20.412]  I really would.
[01:44:20.772 --> 01:44:32.177]  And I had, you know, little faith when I started seeing him crack down on, you know, taking out the Antifa accounts, cracking down on the child exploitation, the sex trafficking, all that stuff.
[01:44:32.277 --> 01:44:32.957]  It's great.
[01:44:33.755 --> 01:44:37.896]  But my intuition is telling me that he is not who we think he is.
[01:44:37.976 --> 01:44:42.598]  And the fact that he refuses to reinstate you really just gets me.
[01:44:42.778 --> 01:44:45.859]  I know that you have your reasoning as to why that may be.
[01:44:45.879 --> 01:44:50.680]  I'm sure there's other things at play that, you know, may not be super clear to those of us on the outside.
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:56.842]  But at the end of the day, if he's really for free speech, then he should absolutely, 100 percent, without question, reinstate you.
[01:44:56.962 --> 01:45:01.844]  I hate the fact that he gave some personal excuse as to why he refused to reinstate you.
[01:45:02.163 --> 01:45:06.243]   And then when it boils down to it, the whole reason why you were banned from Twitter is
[01:45:06.243 --> 01:45:07.603]  for a completely separate reason.
[01:45:07.603 --> 01:45:10.603]  So his logic there completely does not add up.
[01:45:10.603 --> 01:45:16.123]   And you know, I can't help but feel that this is maybe, there's maybe a more sinister agenda
[01:45:16.123 --> 01:45:17.123]  at play.
[01:45:17.123 --> 01:45:21.403]   Perhaps he's doing all the things that us conservatives want him to do to get us all
[01:45:21.403 --> 01:45:22.403]  on his side.
[01:45:22.403 --> 01:45:28.563]   And then eventually he's going to usher in his tyrannical, evil, globalist plan to chip
[01:45:28.869 --> 01:45:34.174]  I mean, he's no stranger to making it known that he wants to put chips in our brains, Neuralink.
[01:45:34.454 --> 01:45:35.536]  I mean, it's just...
[01:45:36.176 --> 01:45:40.059]  It's very sketchy to me, and I don't know that he can truly be trusted.
[01:45:40.479 --> 01:45:43.421]  Absolutely, and I want to be clear, because I've seen your show, you've talked about it.
[01:45:43.801 --> 01:45:48.144]  We're not for taking Antifa accounts down for their free speech being communist dirtbags.
[01:45:48.584 --> 01:45:58.651]  When they called for firebombing and tried to direct people to blow up Tesla headquarters in Silicon Valley and in Austin, Texas, as they did last week, he banned them.
[01:45:58.871 --> 01:46:00.172]  That's not protected free speech.
[01:46:00.613 --> 01:46:05.556]   If I got on air, hypothetically, which I'm not saying, It's the last thing I'd want.
[01:46:06.056 --> 01:46:08.257]  I said, go blow up the Texas Capitol.
[01:46:08.797 --> 01:46:10.258]  I shouldn't just be tagging off Twitter.
[01:46:10.738 --> 01:46:13.099]  A SWAT team should be in a truck on its way.
[01:46:13.119 --> 01:46:16.521]  Because I'm reaching millions of people saying, blow up the Texas Capitol.
[01:46:16.801 --> 01:46:17.902]  Hypothetically, didn't say that.
[01:46:19.222 --> 01:46:21.603]  Again, that's a direct call to violent action.
[01:46:21.643 --> 01:46:22.604]  That's not protected.
[01:46:23.672 --> 01:46:24.593]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:46:24.753 --> 01:46:27.935]  And if I may, Antifa is obviously extremely violent.
[01:46:27.955 --> 01:46:33.358]  I'm not saying take down their accounts just because they're Antifa, but when they've been, you know, no stranger to violence.
[01:46:33.418 --> 01:46:38.341]  I mean, as you mentioned earlier, I used to be on the streets independently reporting.
[01:46:38.621 --> 01:46:40.542]  I would go to many of these protests, many of these events.
[01:46:40.922 --> 01:46:56.048]  Which were completely peaceful, like legitimately peaceful, not some liberal diluted version of peaceful, but we were nothing but truly peaceful, and these crazy psychopaths would show up, cause violence, incite violence, actually physically harm people.
[01:46:56.148 --> 01:47:01.990]  Well that's right, they inherently say they're anti-free speech, and they organize violence publicly, that's illegal.
[01:47:03.132 --> 01:47:03.612]  Exactly.
[01:47:03.993 --> 01:47:05.714]  And they should be monitored.
[01:47:05.734 --> 01:47:06.594]  They should be watched.
[01:47:06.614 --> 01:47:09.897]  They do deserve to have their accounts suspended because this has gone on for far too long.
[01:47:10.197 --> 01:47:13.779]  They've gotten away with literal violence, sending out death threats.
[01:47:13.799 --> 01:47:17.482]  I mean, I'm sure you guys get this all the time, but I get death threats almost weekly.
[01:47:17.502 --> 01:47:18.983]  Oh, they threaten me in my face.
[01:47:19.083 --> 01:47:20.544]  I've seen the videos of them threatening you, yeah.
[01:47:21.545 --> 01:47:25.686]  Of course, and they've even gone as far as sending mail to my workplace.
[01:47:25.746 --> 01:47:28.487]  I mean, how uncomfortable and unsettling is that for me?
[01:47:28.507 --> 01:47:29.868]  So yes, these people need action.
[01:47:29.888 --> 01:47:30.748]  They're a terrorist.
[01:47:30.768 --> 01:47:33.889]  They're an anti-American, anti-freedom terror group.
[01:47:33.949 --> 01:47:43.432]  So all freedoms are protected as long as you hurt somebody else, but when you openly try to overthrow everybody's freedom, then you get outlawed, which is what the Democratic Party and the whole deep state's doing.
[01:47:45.064 --> 01:47:47.746]  Exactly, and they're working for them, ultimately.
[01:47:48.146 --> 01:47:57.053]  And so, I do love that Elon is taking action there, because it is necessary, and they've gone on for far too long getting away with this nonsense that just should not be tolerated.
[01:47:57.073 --> 01:48:01.896]  You know, they say talk show hosts are supposed to be decisive, and I'm very decisive, 99% of the time.
[01:48:01.916 --> 01:48:03.497]  That's why I'm asking listeners, I'm asking you.
[01:48:03.517 --> 01:48:05.579]  I think the jury's out.
[01:48:05.699 --> 01:48:09.502]  I love a lot of what Elon's doing, that's why I'm so torn by the bad things he does.
[01:48:09.542 --> 01:48:11.023]  Gut level, what do you think he really is?
[01:48:13.132 --> 01:48:17.378]  I mean, I think he told us who he was this past Halloween, dressing up as Baphomet.
[01:48:17.578 --> 01:48:20.823]  I mean, what more do we need to see of all costume choices?
[01:48:20.903 --> 01:48:21.203]  That?
[01:48:21.463 --> 01:48:21.724]  Really?
[01:48:21.744 --> 01:48:22.805]  I mean, come on!
[01:48:23.406 --> 01:48:25.509]  I think, you know, he's deceiving us.
[01:48:25.950 --> 01:48:32.612]   I would love to believe him, but I think conservatives are often very quick to jump to find some hero or find a
[01:48:32.612 --> 01:48:37.952]   leader that we can all flock to and think that he's going to come to save us and rescue
[01:48:37.952 --> 01:48:41.733]   us from this nightmare that we've been living the past several years.
[01:48:41.733 --> 01:48:46.492]   But I think we need to really hone in and focus on what's important, which is the new
[01:48:46.492 --> 01:48:50.811]  world order, the globalist attack on us and our freedoms.
[01:48:50.811 --> 01:48:56.311]   And we need to look at the bigger picture here and stop giving all of our power and
[01:48:56.311 --> 01:48:59.112]   hope away to people that may not have our best interest at heart.
[01:48:59.112 --> 01:49:03.311]   You mean we might not want to trust a guy that's the devil's champion?
[01:49:03.311 --> 01:49:06.472]  Yes, precisely.
[01:49:06.472 --> 01:49:07.472]  So is he just the biggest...
[01:49:07.472 --> 01:49:08.472]  Can you trust him?
[01:49:08.472 --> 01:49:09.472]  I don't.
[01:49:09.472 --> 01:49:14.432]  Is he just a mega troll or what is he really?
[01:49:14.432 --> 01:49:15.873]  I think he's working for...
[01:49:16.587 --> 01:49:19.868]  For the globe, I think he may be an undercover globalist myself.
[01:49:19.928 --> 01:49:22.069]  I mean, he's got all the connections.
[01:49:22.429 --> 01:49:23.909]  It's the perfect psy-op, right?
[01:49:23.989 --> 01:49:28.290]  He got the liberals under his thumb with the Teslas, right?
[01:49:28.571 --> 01:49:33.672]  And he's clearly for the electric vehicles, which is part of the New World Order to get everyone on an EV.
[01:49:33.532 --> 01:49:37.771]   EV so they can ultimately control you and track you and trace you.
[01:49:37.771 --> 01:49:39.211]  So he normalized that with Tesla.
[01:49:39.211 --> 01:49:41.451]  Now everyone's got a Tesla, even conservatives.
[01:49:41.451 --> 01:49:43.532]  I don't know about you, but I never want to drive an EV.
[01:49:43.532 --> 01:49:44.891]  I don't want anyone in control of that.
[01:49:44.891 --> 01:49:46.332]  And I think that it could go that far.
[01:49:46.332 --> 01:49:52.532]   I think that he is, you know, quietly bouncing around from party to party to convince people
[01:49:52.532 --> 01:49:53.532]  that he's the good guy.
[01:49:53.532 --> 01:49:59.172]   And in the end, I don't know, I think he could be the evil globalist that we should all actually
[01:49:59.172 --> 01:50:00.172]  fear.
[01:50:00.172 --> 01:50:01.172]  I mean, I don't, I don't get a good.
[01:50:01.172 --> 01:50:02.172]  I totally agree.
[01:50:02.661 --> 01:50:05.662]  And back last week when I was wanting to get you on the show, that was the main clip.
[01:50:05.742 --> 01:50:07.802]  And I didn't send the clip to the crew, so it's my fault.
[01:50:08.263 --> 01:50:15.705]  But a while back ago, you showed the smart meters how they were controlling the thermostat in your house, how it knew when you were in your house, it admitted that.
[01:50:16.105 --> 01:50:19.786]  And now it turns out governments are using them to control people and spy on people.
[01:50:20.107 --> 01:50:24.208]  You got made fun of by the national media, but they admit the smart meters are surveilling us.
[01:50:25.522 --> 01:50:57.493]   They absolutely are, and shortly after that video, after I got attacked and demonized by the left for trying to expose that, which by the way, you had an amazing segment on that probably several decades ago about micro dust or something, I can't remember the specific name, but these little particles that are installed into technology so they can track you and monitor you, and that's exactly what this device is doing, and sure enough, just weeks after I made that video, All of these people in Colorado came forward in the middle of a heat wave when their thermostats were completely shut off because the government is controlling you.
[01:50:57.513 --> 01:50:59.194]  They're not allowing you to have them on.
[01:50:59.274 --> 01:51:04.097]  It's just like we saw with Newsom here saying, oh, you have to limit your power usage from this hour to this hour.
[01:51:04.317 --> 01:51:08.559]  They're slowly ushering in the full government totalitarian takeover.
[01:51:08.599 --> 01:51:11.020]  And this is how they do it, step by step, piece by piece.
[01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:14.282]  And they've got people believing that you're in control.
[01:51:14.342 --> 01:51:14.882]  It's your home.
[01:51:15.382 --> 01:51:16.383]  It would never do that to you.
[01:51:16.423 --> 01:51:17.424]  It just makes your life easier.
[01:51:17.464 --> 01:51:19.005]  It's all in the name of convenience, right?
[01:51:19.225 --> 01:51:26.291]  But no, they really want to spy on you, track you, monitor you, and ultimately shut you down when you want to have control over your own life.
[01:51:26.871 --> 01:51:31.234]  But they can't shut you up, and there's so many other amazing people like you that have popped up the last few years.
[01:51:31.254 --> 01:51:37.239]  I want to come back and talk about you as a private business owner, why you got involved a few years ago, why you stood up, and now what you're doing.
[01:51:37.479 --> 01:51:39.161]  You're a great role model for us all.
[01:51:39.281 --> 01:51:42.964]  Alison Steinberg, one of the top hosts now, out of the gates on OAN.
[01:51:43.884 --> 01:51:54.787]  Allison at large, just incredible and so exciting to have her on and she is certainly alive and not reading off a teleprompter and that scares the New World Order something big time.
[01:51:54.807 --> 01:51:59.028]  We'll also look at China, the model of control, get her take on what's happening currently there.
[01:51:59.348 --> 01:52:00.869]  Now Big Tech's been supporting it.
[01:52:00.889 --> 01:52:01.309]  Stay with us.
[01:52:02.009 --> 01:52:03.750]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:07.471]  You know, I'm really glad that Project Veritas did this.
[01:52:07.531 --> 01:52:08.051]  It just broke.
[01:52:08.091 --> 01:52:09.511]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:52:10.072 --> 01:52:11.712]  Oh, Troy will be covering at 3 p.m.
[01:52:11.732 --> 01:52:27.097]  Central today, but we went down there last year, the year before last, and this year, and we showed the human smuggling of even babies being handed over to random people, and we got it all on tape, and people are like, whatever.
[01:52:28.237 --> 01:52:33.939]  But Project Veritas does it undercover with a DHS whistleblower, and it's huge, and I'm not in competition with them.
[01:52:35.031 --> 01:52:35.491]  That's great.
[01:52:37.012 --> 01:52:39.372]  But our reports back at the time were incredible.
[01:52:39.392 --> 01:52:52.836]  We sent an undercover police officer locally who was working with us in to the Maine Migrant Center and they had private men there with white vans getting little kids with no documentation and they're just disappearing into the country.
[01:52:54.097 --> 01:52:55.157]  Well now it just broke.
[01:52:55.277 --> 01:52:55.557]  U.S.
[01:52:55.577 --> 01:53:05.439]   Department of Health and Human Services whistleblower reveals tax dollars spent to put children quote in the hands of criminals says government complicit because we don't get sued by Traffickers.
[01:53:06.079 --> 01:53:06.740]  Migrant child.
[01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:09.863]  My family sponsor would pimp me to men.
[01:53:11.404 --> 01:53:12.385]  Children as young as two.
[01:53:13.305 --> 01:53:13.946]  It's all on video.
[01:53:13.966 --> 01:53:18.009]  So what I want the crew to do is to go back to us trying to stop the smuggling car.
[01:53:18.630 --> 01:53:21.772]  The guy coming out confronting us saying, I'm going to teach these young girls the way of the Lord.
[01:53:22.193 --> 01:53:22.933]  Super creepy.
[01:53:23.914 --> 01:53:25.175]  Or what undercover cops said.
[01:53:25.215 --> 01:53:27.798]  Because no one cares when we actually break it ahead of time.
[01:53:28.158 --> 01:53:30.560]  Everybody cares later when somebody else breaks it.
[01:53:31.041 --> 01:53:31.541]  Which is great.
[01:53:31.661 --> 01:53:32.802]  We love Project Veritas.
[01:53:32.842 --> 01:53:33.663]  We love James O'Keefe.
[01:53:34.063 --> 01:53:36.425]  But I'm just saying, we don't just have the whistleblowers.
[01:53:36.485 --> 01:53:38.147]  We have the damn video of it happening.
[01:53:40.259 --> 01:53:48.081]  The woman over and over at the airport handing six-month-old babies, year-old babies, people saying, here, with no documentation, the baby just is handed to people and disappears.
[01:53:48.421 --> 01:53:49.502]  We have the footage.
[01:53:52.342 --> 01:53:53.123]  Unbelievable.
[01:53:54.423 --> 01:53:55.523]  Absolutely insane.
[01:53:57.864 --> 01:54:13.194]   Going back to Alison Steinberg, I want to get into China and what's happening over there and incredible carnage and lockdowns and where you see that going, but what do you make of just openly coming out that the commodity The thing that runs this whole New World Order is children and sex slavery.
[01:54:13.575 --> 01:54:16.022]  I mean, what is going on?
[01:54:16.403 --> 01:54:17.566]  How widespread is this?
[01:54:19.318 --> 01:54:21.859]  I mean, it just seems like it's everywhere.
[01:54:21.959 --> 01:54:22.739]  It's unavoidable.
[01:54:22.859 --> 01:54:30.902]  I mean, from what you just said with this new Project Veritas news, Savannah Hernandez recently broke a similar story of what's going on at the border.
[01:54:30.922 --> 01:54:33.283]  I mean, it just doesn't end.
[01:54:33.323 --> 01:54:37.145]  And now this Balenciaga stuff, I mean, it's all seemingly intertwined.
[01:54:37.725 --> 01:54:41.786]   And the fact that, you know, this is happening Should concern everyone.
[01:54:41.826 --> 01:54:45.747]  As I said earlier, this could be the key that awakens everyone.
[01:54:45.867 --> 01:54:49.768]  And it is absolutely devastating that this is happening, but maybe this is what people need.
[01:54:49.848 --> 01:54:50.488]  I don't know what more.
[01:54:50.508 --> 01:54:57.969]  I mean, we see the people in China who are absolutely revolting because of these insane, draconian lockdowns from COVID.
[01:54:58.469 --> 01:55:00.970]  I mean, is that what... We had that happen here.
[01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:03.730]  I mean, not nearly as bad as what's going on in China, but... No, no, no.
[01:55:03.870 --> 01:55:05.451]  They tried it here.
[01:55:05.551 --> 01:55:06.731]  Fauci's even praising it.
[01:55:07.751 --> 01:55:08.632]  Right, he's praising it.
[01:55:09.333 --> 01:55:13.518]  You know, Klaus Schwab is saying that China is the model for how we should run everything.
[01:55:13.899 --> 01:55:15.301]  It's just disturbing beyond belief.
[01:55:15.561 --> 01:55:21.228]  I don't know why, when the lockdowns were happening here, people were not out in the streets revolting.
[01:55:21.248 --> 01:55:22.530]  I mean, I was...
[01:55:23.423 --> 01:55:26.986]  On the ground, trying to get people rallied up, obviously, peacefully.
[01:55:27.766 --> 01:55:34.811]  But the fact that it's not happening, and it is not happening here, but it is in China, I don't know what to make of that.
[01:55:35.051 --> 01:55:43.497]  It's quite amazing to me that people in a literal communist country can get up and stand up and rise up and combat the tyranny that is taking over.
[01:55:43.897 --> 01:55:45.439]  Why do we need to let that happen here?
[01:55:45.519 --> 01:55:47.260]  Is this what we need to happen with all of this?
[01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:50.161]  Child exploitation, sex trafficking, insanity.
[01:55:50.221 --> 01:55:54.282]  Is that what we need to have people out in the streets revolting like the people in China?
[01:55:54.322 --> 01:55:56.842]  Because it seems to me people here are way too complacent.
[01:55:57.082 --> 01:56:01.843]  We are way too distracted with all of this nonsense scrolling and swiping away on our phones.
[01:56:02.303 --> 01:56:02.943]  Wake up!
[01:56:03.184 --> 01:56:05.724]  There is just tragedy after tragedy after tragedy.
[01:56:05.964 --> 01:56:08.565]  If people in China can do this, where are we?
[01:56:09.645 --> 01:56:09.905]  Wow.
[01:56:11.045 --> 01:56:17.741]   And when we look at this, People said you support Trump or DeSantis.
[01:56:17.921 --> 01:56:19.262]  I'm nothing against Trump or DeSantis.
[01:56:19.302 --> 01:56:19.883]  I like them both.
[01:56:20.364 --> 01:56:21.405]  I'm not worried about them.
[01:56:21.505 --> 01:56:23.007]  I'm not looking for a political solution.
[01:56:23.367 --> 01:56:29.093]  We the people have to start saying no and getting aggressive legally and lawfully and confronting this.
[01:56:29.114 --> 01:56:30.155]  And I think that's really the answer.
[01:56:31.374 --> 01:56:36.216]  Absolutely, and the fact that people are so hung up on Trump versus DeSantis, I mean, why?
[01:56:36.716 --> 01:56:44.220]  If we got our last election stolen, then how on earth can we even be looking to 24 when 20 has not been resolved?
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:55.205]  There's no point in even bickering about that because there are so many issues from previous years that are still unsettled, and as we just saw in Arizona, the trend is continuing.
[01:56:55.925 --> 01:57:00.469]  There's no hope for a better tomorrow if we can't fix yesterday.
[01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:05.513]  And I don't understand why people don't seem to get that or what more needs to be done.
[01:57:05.993 --> 01:57:08.275]  But I think we really need to refocus on that.
[01:57:08.295 --> 01:57:15.021]  And that's something I wish Trump would step up and talk about, too, because he's announced his run for 24, which is great.
[01:57:15.101 --> 01:57:17.403]  But what is he going to do to resolve 2020?
[01:57:18.123 --> 01:57:23.628]  And how can we count on him winning 24 if the last election was stolen?
[01:57:25.327 --> 01:57:30.790]  So, Alison, how do you see all this not ending, but what's the next phase?
[01:57:30.810 --> 01:57:35.773]  Look at all the forces coming together, good and bad, and also apathetic.
[01:57:35.853 --> 01:57:39.836]  All these forces coming together, gut level, what do you see happening next?
[01:57:40.882 --> 01:57:49.050]  Yeah, it's a really interesting time because, you know, with the MAGA movement and with Trump before the stolen election, I feel like the conservatives were extremely united.
[01:57:49.130 --> 01:57:55.315]  I mean, myself being out there in the streets, at the rallies, at the protests, being amongst the masses of people.
[01:57:55.355 --> 01:58:00.840]  I mean, there were thousands of people who flew in from out of state who drove hours to join these events.
[01:58:01.841 --> 01:58:05.443]  And it was just this incredible feeling that I had never felt in my life.
[01:58:05.483 --> 01:58:07.404]  I mean, it just brought so much joy and unity.
[01:58:07.985 --> 01:58:12.707]  And that is the energy I think we need to focus on bringing back because now everyone is so divided.
[01:58:12.747 --> 01:58:21.492]  We have all of these different people intertwining and getting in the middle of a movement that should be, you know, trumping all else.
[01:58:22.272 --> 01:58:31.197]  There's people like Elon Musk, and Trump, and DeSantis, and yay, West, and of course all of the Democrats who are interjecting as well.
[01:58:31.237 --> 01:58:39.321]  But I think it's really a bigger picture plan to keep us all divided because they saw how strong the MAGA movement was and that terrified them.
[01:58:39.801 --> 01:58:50.406]  And I think we really need to focus on getting together and not letting these sick people divide us because our unity is the only hope of overcoming this.
[01:58:50.746 --> 01:58:51.187]  I agree.
[01:58:51.227 --> 01:58:53.069]  We shouldn't get obsessed with personalities.
[01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:54.310]  We should be issue-based.
[01:58:55.211 --> 01:59:06.723]  And if we're based on issues like lower energy costs, secure borders, stepping up against child exploitation, sex slavery, standing up for a strong currency, just bedrock issues is what we need to judge people by.
[01:59:07.865 --> 01:59:08.325]  Exactly.
[01:59:08.405 --> 01:59:19.352]  It's just it comes down to basic common sense and we need a common sense representative who can, you know, stop the division and get us all together on one side because it really should be a nonpartisan issue.
[01:59:19.392 --> 01:59:25.936]  All these things that are happening with the border crisis, the drug infiltrating, I mean, just the money laundering left and right.
[01:59:26.216 --> 01:59:28.558]  It's just it's it should be a non-issue.
[01:59:28.598 --> 01:59:29.358]  But clearly it is.
[01:59:29.418 --> 01:59:35.542]  It's been everything's been so politicized and we need someone that can truly bring us together and work on resolving the issues of the past.
[01:59:35.602 --> 01:59:36.763]  Otherwise, there is no future.
[01:59:37.389 --> 01:59:40.050]  Well, you talk about the battle of good versus evil.
[01:59:40.130 --> 01:59:42.972]  I mean, that's really what this is.
[01:59:44.433 --> 01:59:45.333]  Absolutely, it is.
[01:59:45.533 --> 01:59:51.776]  And, you know, I think, you know, as we were just talking about, these leaders try to come in and that's great.
[01:59:51.816 --> 01:59:54.498]  Obviously, we need someone to lead the movement, so to speak.
[01:59:54.878 --> 01:59:58.920]  But at the end of the day, I think it's important for us to remember that no one is going to save us.
[02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:08.183]   The best that we have is each other and this time here on Earth that we've been so blessed to have and we need to remember that Jesus is the only
[02:00:08.183 --> 02:00:09.183]  person that's going to save us.
[02:00:09.183 --> 02:00:10.882]  So we need to get right with Jesus.
[02:00:10.882 --> 02:00:12.962]  We need to think about what really matters here.
[02:00:12.962 --> 02:00:16.843]   We need to stop getting caught up in these little tiffs with one another and we need
[02:00:16.843 --> 02:00:22.023]   to unite and come together with love because love trumps all and I think we need to kind
[02:00:22.023 --> 02:00:25.003]  of restore the faith that our country was founded upon.
[02:00:25.003 --> 02:00:26.262]  I totally agree.
[02:00:26.246 --> 02:00:28.207]  You know, I asked you this before the last segment ended.
[02:00:28.427 --> 02:00:29.087]  We didn't get to that.
[02:00:29.107 --> 02:00:29.607]  We come back.
[02:00:30.067 --> 02:00:32.348]  Talk about yourself, because you're a really interesting person.
[02:00:32.728 --> 02:00:33.868]  You're a role model for others.
[02:00:33.908 --> 02:00:35.528]  Just a few years ago, you're a private citizen.
[02:00:35.969 --> 02:00:36.569]  Own your business.
[02:00:36.589 --> 02:00:38.289]  You're upset about the lockdowns, the tyranny.
[02:00:38.809 --> 02:00:44.110]  You get engaged, and now you've got one of the top shows on OAN, reaching millions of people every single week.
[02:00:44.130 --> 02:00:50.152]  I want to talk about that, but where is the best place for everybody to find you that wants to find your show, find the clips?
[02:00:51.548 --> 02:00:52.048]  Absolutely.
[02:00:52.088 --> 02:00:52.829]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:00:52.889 --> 02:00:56.250]  You can find me on Instagram and Twitter at Allison's Rage Page.
[02:00:56.270 --> 02:01:01.592]  That's Allison with one L. And you can find all of my shows on our website at OANN.com.
[02:01:01.712 --> 02:01:03.872]  Go to the Shows tab and click on Allison at Large.
[02:01:03.892 --> 02:01:05.093]  We're also on Rumble as well.
[02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.871]  Well, it's beautiful.
[02:01:06.931 --> 02:01:09.272]  Everything you're doing is amazing, and it's so exciting.
[02:01:09.312 --> 02:01:14.996]  And I can't wait to see who the next big crop of patriots is, because every one of us they try to suppress.
[02:01:15.056 --> 02:01:19.539]  Ten more pop up, a hundred more pop up, and that is so incredibly exciting.
[02:01:19.939 --> 02:01:22.061]  Alison Steinberg, final segment straight ahead.
[02:01:22.081 --> 02:01:26.284]  Then another amazing lady from Australia, leading the fight against tyranny there.
[02:01:26.344 --> 02:01:29.786]  She'll be hosting coming up in the fourth hour.
[02:01:30.146 --> 02:01:45.417]   Coming up in an hour and 13 minutes, Owen Schroyer takes over the war room, and he's going to be covering big time This video that we've now watched that's been posted at InfoWars.com from Project Veritas, this DHS whistleblower is powerful how they're selling children directly into sex slavery.
[02:01:45.797 --> 02:01:48.639]  The Senate report also confirms that, but this is an eyewitness to it.
[02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:56.865]  This just, for any parent particularly, just shakes your very core that this is what the Democratic-controlled government is doing by design.
[02:01:56.885 --> 02:01:58.286]  These people are pedophiles.
[02:01:58.306 --> 02:01:59.047]  They are Satanists.
[02:01:59.087 --> 02:02:01.709]  They are the scum of the earth.
[02:02:02.309 --> 02:02:03.931]  Allison Steinberg, let's talk about you.
[02:02:04.631 --> 02:02:06.493]  Because I saw you a few years ago on OAN.
[02:02:06.513 --> 02:02:07.855]  You've been a guest with me sometime.
[02:02:07.915 --> 02:02:08.595]  Follow your work.
[02:02:09.276 --> 02:02:11.178]  And then boom, you're on OAN doing a great job.
[02:02:11.659 --> 02:02:14.142]  You're an example to others to get involved and get engaged.
[02:02:14.882 --> 02:02:18.867]  Tell us about your trajectory and what got you politically awakened and involved.
[02:02:20.410 --> 02:02:26.893]  Well, I can't start without thanking you, Alex, for having me on and giving me a platform because that has certainly helped amplify my voice.
[02:02:26.933 --> 02:02:28.213]  So I just want to say thank you for that.
[02:02:28.233 --> 02:02:34.255]  And of course, all of your hard work for waking up so many people because you are a huge reason as to why I am where I am today.
[02:02:34.355 --> 02:02:35.556]  So thank you so much for that.
[02:02:36.296 --> 02:02:38.117]  But Alex, I got to be honest with you.
[02:02:38.177 --> 02:02:41.838]  It primarily started for me during the height of the COVID stuff.
[02:02:41.878 --> 02:02:44.599]  I mean, I was an independent business owner.
[02:02:44.799 --> 02:02:51.001]  I was a makeup artist working in Hollywood in the thick of the just in the belly of the beast.
[02:02:51.041 --> 02:02:52.602]  I mean, it was it was disgusting.
[02:02:52.642 --> 02:02:57.363]  And as time was progressing and I was seeing all of these, you know, things become so liberal.
[02:02:57.383 --> 02:03:02.425]  I wasn't even really involved with politics at the time, but I saw men coming in wanting to get their makeup done.
[02:03:02.465 --> 02:03:04.506]  And I'm just like, this is not OK.
[02:03:04.546 --> 02:03:04.866]  I can't.
[02:03:05.246 --> 02:03:05.907]  Can't really deal with this.
[02:03:05.947 --> 02:03:13.933]  And then COVID hit, and all of my hard work, my 10 years of building up my own business, just went out the door because my business was shut down.
[02:03:14.094 --> 02:03:15.235]  I had no option to work.
[02:03:15.295 --> 02:03:18.037]  Independent contractors got completely screwed out of the deal.
[02:03:18.297 --> 02:03:24.002]  I was getting no money, and it left me with a whole lot of time to do my own research and figure out what was going on here.
[02:03:24.102 --> 02:03:28.506]  So I have to thank COVID for the massive wake-up call.
[02:03:29.446 --> 02:03:32.849]   But it was then that I You know, put my foot down.
[02:03:32.909 --> 02:03:33.769]  I wasn't going to stand for it.
[02:03:33.789 --> 02:03:38.852]  I wasn't going to let the government and Gavin Newsom tell me what I can and can't do.
[02:03:38.872 --> 02:03:40.693]  I started taking my clients again.
[02:03:40.713 --> 02:03:42.454]  I got involved in my community.
[02:03:42.474 --> 02:03:49.678]  I was fortunate enough to meet an incredible group of people who were very like-minded, who were shockingly in Los Angeles.
[02:03:49.718 --> 02:03:52.039]  I mean, who even knew there were conservatives there?
[02:03:52.839 --> 02:03:59.823]  But it all pushed me to, you know, get more in touch with who I truly am, what my beliefs are, what I stand for, what I will and will not tolerate.
[02:04:00.023 --> 02:04:03.382]   And it was so empowering. It was an incredible time of my life.
[02:04:03.382 --> 02:04:10.063]   That eventually led me to meet Jess Weber of Weber's Way, which is where I started my boots-on-the-ground independent
[02:04:10.063 --> 02:04:10.682]  reporting.
[02:04:10.682 --> 02:04:13.882]   And I would go out onto the streets and get people to weigh in
[02:04:13.882 --> 02:04:16.983]  on current issues and the COVID stuff because I was just baffled.
[02:04:16.983 --> 02:04:20.382]   You know, I wanted to see what other people thought, where they stood,
[02:04:20.382 --> 02:04:23.682]   why they thought what they thought, why they were wearing seven masks.
[02:04:23.770 --> 02:04:28.373]  I mean, I just found it fascinating for no reason other than my own personal interest.
[02:04:28.393 --> 02:04:34.197]  So, Jeff Weber was so kind to give me that platform to start interviewing people on the streets.
[02:04:34.757 --> 02:04:41.082]  That got a little bit of traction and it was great insight to see, you know, where people stood and why they thought what they thought.
[02:04:41.822 --> 02:04:43.683]  And eventually I just kept speaking out.
[02:04:43.723 --> 02:04:44.503]  I made videos.
[02:04:45.044 --> 02:04:50.626]  You probably remember my Starbucks video that got a bit of viral attention.
[02:04:50.646 --> 02:05:05.292]   I was in my own car trying to order a drink in a Starbucks drive-thru and the Idiot working the cashier told me that he was unable to hand me my drink unless I was wearing a mask in my own vehicle.
[02:05:05.312 --> 02:05:06.952]  So I told him that's ridiculous.
[02:05:06.972 --> 02:05:08.453]  I'm absolutely not putting a mask on.
[02:05:08.913 --> 02:05:12.434]  And he ultimately told me, well, I can hand you a mask.
[02:05:12.834 --> 02:05:14.116]  And I said, I'm sorry, what?
[02:05:14.176 --> 02:05:17.019]  You can hand me a mask, but you can't hand me my drink?
[02:05:17.159 --> 02:05:18.120]  How does that make any sense?
[02:05:18.241 --> 02:05:19.943]  And his brain was just baffled.
[02:05:20.043 --> 02:05:23.667]  So that was a huge wake-up call for a lot of people.
[02:05:23.707 --> 02:05:32.596]   Shockingly, as funny as the video was, it ultimately got people thinking and started Allowing people to use their brains for their first time since all of the COVID stuff happened.
[02:05:32.616 --> 02:05:36.959]  I had so many people message me saying, thank you for your common sense approach.
[02:05:37.239 --> 02:05:38.160]  This is ridiculous.
[02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:43.424]  It even woke up people who weren't really political or identified more with the Democrat side of things.
[02:05:43.504 --> 02:05:57.210]   So after that video happened, it allowed me to realize that I, just me, this, you know, little person from LA and this small fish in a big sea, could have that much of an impact and could actually drive
[02:05:57.210 --> 02:05:59.310]  a point home to a mass audience.
[02:05:59.310 --> 02:06:03.210]   It was just so inspiring and uplifting and it pushed me to want to continue to speak
[02:06:03.210 --> 02:06:04.210]  out.
[02:06:04.210 --> 02:06:09.210]   I felt it was my civic duty to do so because I couldn't just sit idly by watching the corruption
[02:06:09.210 --> 02:06:10.210]  take over.
[02:06:10.210 --> 02:06:13.350]   And I knew that I needed to do this and I felt like it was my calling because my old
[02:06:13.350 --> 02:06:16.569]   life working in makeup with Hollywood and celebrities, it no longer meant anything to
[02:06:16.569 --> 02:06:18.470]  me and I knew how disgusting these people were.
[02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:22.429]   So I felt it was more important to come out and speak up and speak out.
[02:06:22.429 --> 02:06:26.469]   And from there I've just met so many incredible people and I think that that has continued
[02:06:26.469 --> 02:06:29.969]   to inspire me, meeting people like Matt Baker, who I know you've had on your show several
[02:06:29.969 --> 02:06:30.969]  times.
[02:06:30.969 --> 02:06:34.230]   There's a great group of freedom fighters here in San Diego who are working tirelessly
[02:06:34.230 --> 02:06:38.429]   to get our message out and to host events to get more people involved.
[02:06:38.387 --> 02:06:50.074]  And it just brings me so much joy to know that there are so many like-minded people that are working so hard every single day to keep up this fight and to keep going during these rather difficult times.
[02:06:50.314 --> 02:06:52.235]  And I think that we all need to be better about that.
[02:06:52.255 --> 02:06:54.957]  And it just goes to show that if I can do it, so can everyone else.
[02:06:54.977 --> 02:07:01.461]  So I truly encourage everyone to start speaking up if they have not already and share your message because you never know who you could influence.
[02:07:01.821 --> 02:07:02.402]  Well, that's right.
[02:07:02.602 --> 02:07:07.946]  And again, I remember meeting with a top globalist one time and they said, you don't get it.
[02:07:08.847 --> 02:07:12.250]  The public's going to adapt to being slaves, not adapt to overcome like you think.
[02:07:12.370 --> 02:07:14.332]  But no, we're not like animals.
[02:07:14.392 --> 02:07:15.813]  We have a choice about our environment.
[02:07:15.853 --> 02:07:16.493]  We have a soul.
[02:07:17.074 --> 02:07:20.477]  We can choose to overcome it and defeat it or choose to submit to it.
[02:07:20.877 --> 02:07:22.779]  And you've chosen not to submit to it.
[02:07:22.819 --> 02:07:23.839]  You've chosen to overcome it.
[02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:29.524]  And they're so scared of independent people like you and your voice and where you've come in just two years.
[02:07:29.984 --> 02:07:31.965]  I mean, it's nothing but a pure success story.
[02:07:32.326 --> 02:07:33.526]  Because I see your stuff everywhere.
[02:07:33.546 --> 02:07:35.408]  You're reaching millions and millions of people a week now.
[02:07:35.988 --> 02:07:38.890]  And I see Media Matters, Democratic Party attacking national news.
[02:07:39.230 --> 02:07:40.291]  They are so scared of you.
[02:07:40.331 --> 02:07:45.335]  But people should see their attacks on you as a badge of certification that you're good.
[02:07:45.675 --> 02:07:47.216]  But you don't need to have that certification.
[02:07:47.236 --> 02:07:48.017]  People know you're good.
[02:07:48.317 --> 02:07:49.538]  You're saying truthful things.
[02:07:51.016 --> 02:07:53.878]  Absolutely, and I think that's all what it boils down to is just speaking the truth.
[02:07:54.198 --> 02:07:55.479]  Who cares how the media spins it?
[02:07:55.519 --> 02:07:57.921]  And like you said, it is a badge of honor in my opinion.
[02:07:57.981 --> 02:08:02.524]  The more they attack me, the more it means to me that I am doing something right.
[02:08:02.604 --> 02:08:05.426]  So I think that is the ultimate message, obviously, is truth.
[02:08:05.466 --> 02:08:06.646]  That's why we are all here.
[02:08:06.727 --> 02:08:07.687]  We just want to know the truth.
[02:08:07.747 --> 02:08:12.410]  And I think that that is a message that can resonate with so many people, regardless of where you stand politically.
[02:08:12.690 --> 02:08:15.412]  We just want to know the truth and what's so dangerous about that.
[02:08:15.492 --> 02:08:24.539]   I mean, obviously, They don't want us knowing the truth, but I think we can all come together for the purpose of finding the truth.
[02:08:24.559 --> 02:08:32.445]  And I think we all need to work together to help get the truth out and expose the corruption that's happening in every facet of our lives.
[02:08:33.006 --> 02:08:33.486]  Well, you're right.
[02:08:33.526 --> 02:08:35.188]  This is such a historic time.
[02:08:35.988 --> 02:08:38.269]  It's really a time for choice, to decide who we're going to be.
[02:08:38.489 --> 02:08:43.051]  And as bad as things are, we didn't cause all this evil, but it's our job to counter it.
[02:08:43.111 --> 02:08:47.612]  And so people shouldn't see this as, oh, a job, or oh, it's terrible, and oh, it's insurmountable.
[02:08:47.992 --> 02:08:49.893]  It's invigorating, in my experience.
[02:08:50.353 --> 02:08:53.014]  It's empowering to challenge this.
[02:08:53.194 --> 02:08:57.435]  And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but over time, you get stronger, evil gets weaker.
[02:08:57.476 --> 02:08:58.576]  I think that's really my message.
[02:08:59.821 --> 02:09:00.342]  Absolutely.
[02:09:00.422 --> 02:09:01.904]  And I know you know that better than everyone.
[02:09:01.924 --> 02:09:03.526]  I mean, it is exhausting.
[02:09:03.566 --> 02:09:04.287]  It is daunting.
[02:09:04.327 --> 02:09:08.753]  I mean, being caught up in the news cycle every day definitely has its pros and cons.
[02:09:08.793 --> 02:09:10.495]  I mean, we are very informed, obviously.
[02:09:10.555 --> 02:09:12.778]  But, you know, it can get a little depressing.
[02:09:13.965 --> 02:09:14.566]  That's life.
[02:09:14.586 --> 02:09:16.747]  You know, it's our job to cover this.
[02:09:16.787 --> 02:09:23.332]  It's our job to be here for all of these breaking stories and to shed light on what's happening.
[02:09:23.652 --> 02:09:30.897]  Because at the end of the day, people need to know, and obviously the mainstream media is doing a very poor job at getting that message out there.
[02:09:31.238 --> 02:09:33.079]  So I find it invigorating as well.
[02:09:33.139 --> 02:09:35.421]  I think it's an incredible time to be alive.
[02:09:35.861 --> 02:09:41.765]   It's just A rare and unique opportunity that so few people get to have.
[02:09:42.006 --> 02:09:49.611]  And I just think that we need to keep working together to continue getting the message out there because there is never enough truth.
[02:09:49.631 --> 02:09:53.454]  I mean, as you know, we get censored every opportunity they get.
[02:09:53.854 --> 02:09:56.276]  Now with Elon, you know, who knows where that's going to go.
[02:09:56.376 --> 02:10:03.622]  But I do feel like we are breaking through and we are, you know, making major, major waves in the whole grand scheme of it all.
[02:10:04.497 --> 02:10:08.759]  Well, that's why as much as I want to criticize Elon, I'm so happy by what he's doing.
[02:10:08.799 --> 02:10:10.759]  He really is freeing up Twitter to a great extent.
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:15.141]  And if one big tech platform is quasi-free, they've all got to go that way.
[02:10:15.541 --> 02:10:19.843]  Instead, they want to just unify the censorship, act like it's normal, get us all to submit to it.
[02:10:19.903 --> 02:10:23.445]  So that's why I'm so frustrated by Elon, because I want to root for him.
[02:10:24.045 --> 02:10:24.865]  I want to support him.
[02:10:24.905 --> 02:10:29.447]  So I think we just support what he's doing that's good, call him out where he's bad, and just keep moving forward.
[02:10:30.845 --> 02:10:32.806]  Absolutely, I think that's the best we can do right now.
[02:10:33.667 --> 02:10:41.191]  You know, definitely proceed with caution due to the things that we've discussed earlier, but I do think for the time being he is doing good work.
[02:10:41.491 --> 02:10:44.092]  He is, you know, letting us speak freely.
[02:10:44.133 --> 02:10:52.016]   I mean, I don't know about you Alex, he's still got some work to do in that department, but For the vast majority of us, we are breaking through.
[02:10:52.056 --> 02:10:54.597]  We are, you know, actually having our messages seen.
[02:10:54.657 --> 02:11:01.339]  People are going viral for the first time that never even were on the map, which I think is incredible, and it is a good testimony as to what's happening here.
[02:11:02.279 --> 02:11:06.640]  So, yeah, I have to give him credit where credit is due, as long as he keeps up the good work.
[02:11:06.900 --> 02:11:07.540]  Absolutely.
[02:11:08.161 --> 02:11:09.241]  Well, freedom is popular.
[02:11:09.321 --> 02:11:10.741]  Alison Steinberg, amazing job.
[02:11:10.781 --> 02:11:12.442]  When does your next show air at LAM?
[02:11:13.757 --> 02:11:15.419]  I'm on daily, every single day.

[02:11:33.835 --> 02:11:35.877]  I'm so bad with the time, so forgive me.
[02:11:35.897 --> 02:11:36.517]  No, no, no, me too.
[02:11:36.537 --> 02:11:36.697]  8 p.m.
[02:11:36.757 --> 02:11:37.118]  Eastern.

[02:11:49.049 --> 02:11:49.870]  We'd love to get you on.
[02:11:49.890 --> 02:11:50.530]  Thank you so much.
[02:11:51.071 --> 02:11:51.971]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:11:52.031 --> 02:11:52.732]  And everyone, get X3.
[02:11:53.032 --> 02:11:54.012]  It's my favorite product.
[02:11:54.053 --> 02:11:54.633]  You're amazing.
[02:11:54.653 --> 02:11:55.493]  Keep up the great work.
[02:11:55.533 --> 02:11:55.974]  We love you.
[02:11:55.994 --> 02:11:56.474]  Oh, you're awesome.
[02:11:56.514 --> 02:11:57.355]  Wow, what a great lady.
[02:11:57.375 --> 02:11:59.996]  All right, I'll do a few more minutes and hand the baton to the next host.
[02:12:00.477 --> 02:12:01.617]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:12:01.637 --> 02:12:02.018]  Stay with us.
[02:12:02.438 --> 02:12:06.881]  Every move you make, every breath you take, New World Order is going to be watching you.
[02:12:08.246 --> 02:12:10.887]  Yes, I've been a fan for 10 years and I'm a first time caller.
[02:12:10.907 --> 02:12:14.868]  I think Elon's comments about you are ridiculous.
[02:12:14.688 --> 02:12:16.606]  That's Robert, California.
[02:12:16.606 --> 02:12:18.807]  Thanks for holding it on the air.
[02:12:18.807 --> 02:12:21.007]  Hi, yes, I've been a fan for 10 years.
[02:12:21.007 --> 02:12:23.127]  I'm a first time caller.
[02:12:23.127 --> 02:12:26.148]  I think Elon's comments about you are ridiculous.
[02:12:26.148 --> 02:12:33.328]   I can't believe how he could say something like that when you've been a defender of children
[02:12:33.328 --> 02:12:36.067]  and advocate against pedophiles.
[02:12:36.067 --> 02:12:42.367]   I mean, and then he's gonna go up there and say all those things and with passion too,
[02:12:42.367 --> 02:12:43.828]  like my baby died.
[02:12:44.216 --> 02:12:47.257]  And, you know, that's why we have to hate Alex Jones.
[02:12:47.417 --> 02:12:49.698]  I mean, it's absurd.
[02:12:51.119 --> 02:12:53.279]  And now his ex-wife says he made it up.
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:55.160]  The baby didn't die on his arms.
[02:12:56.381 --> 02:12:56.821]  Oh, wow.
[02:12:57.281 --> 02:13:02.923]  Yeah, I remember when the Thai divers were trying to rescue the kids.
[02:13:03.759 --> 02:13:08.140]  And they got in his way or something and he said they were pedophiles.
[02:13:08.981 --> 02:13:14.562]  And it seems like a pattern to me, like once somebody gets in his way, he accuses them of being pedophiles.
[02:13:15.322 --> 02:13:19.383]  And I don't know, or herders of children is what he's trying to say you are.
[02:13:20.124 --> 02:13:28.466]  And to me, I see a pattern, you know, and I don't know what's happened to him before, but I think it's really unfair the way he's treating you.
[02:13:29.264 --> 02:13:31.825]  Well, I appreciate you standing up for me.
[02:13:31.845 --> 02:13:33.226]  At the end of the day, I'm not worried about that.
[02:13:33.246 --> 02:13:38.448]  I just want to know who he's really working for.
[02:13:38.508 --> 02:13:40.429]  I like a lot of what he's doing.
[02:13:40.449 --> 02:13:43.170]  We're going to have to watch the long game here, brother.
[02:13:43.210 --> 02:13:43.930]  I appreciate your call.
[02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.670]  Thank you so much.
[02:13:45.311 --> 02:13:48.052]  Let's go to Heath in FEMA Region 4.
[02:13:48.132 --> 02:13:48.692]  Thanks for holding.
[02:13:48.712 --> 02:13:50.633]  Hey, man.
[02:13:50.653 --> 02:13:51.133]  How you been?
[02:13:51.573 --> 02:13:52.013]  Alright, brother.
[02:13:52.033 --> 02:13:52.334]  Go ahead.
[02:13:53.174 --> 02:13:53.674]  Good.
[02:13:53.914 --> 02:13:58.196]  Hey, I appreciate you making a commercial out of that last call, but listen.
[02:13:58.683 --> 02:14:00.144]  You know, I don't know how you do it, man.
[02:14:00.284 --> 02:14:10.129]  Say what you want about Alex Jones, but you are acting like a gentleman in this war that we're in and conducting yourself like one.
[02:14:10.149 --> 02:14:12.751]  I mean, say it like Elon Musk.
[02:14:13.351 --> 02:14:18.414]  You said everything that there needed to be said with your, you know, Anakin Skywalker rant.
[02:14:18.634 --> 02:14:19.874]  You know, I mean, mic drop.
[02:14:19.934 --> 02:14:20.855]  What else do you want to say?
[02:14:22.930 --> 02:14:25.731]  Well, I just, I mean, I don't want to look, I'm not perfect either.
[02:14:25.811 --> 02:14:26.451]  I'm trying to be good.
[02:14:26.511 --> 02:14:27.031]  I make mistakes.
[02:14:27.471 --> 02:14:33.352]  I'm trying to hope he really does want to be good, but I can't be naive about it that, you know, it, it, it.
[02:14:36.253 --> 02:14:39.553]  Anything else is just, you know, tiptoeing around the issue.
[02:14:40.014 --> 02:15:01.372]   If you look at his company, SpaceX and Boring Company and everything else, once you're aware of things like Project High Jump or Paperclip or Admiral Bird or You know, like the tunnel in Geneva or wherever, it's all obvious and anything else is just not true.
[02:15:02.772 --> 02:15:03.152]  I agree.
[02:15:03.252 --> 02:15:08.113]  Once you know who the cult is, you realize how crazy they are when they're in control.
[02:15:08.133 --> 02:15:09.554]  Heath, thank you so much.
[02:15:09.614 --> 02:15:10.874]  John of Nebraska, you're on the air.
[02:15:11.974 --> 02:15:13.175]  Oh, yeah, Alex.
[02:15:13.215 --> 02:15:17.336]  Six months ago, I was in Reno in a YMCA locker room.
[02:15:19.674 --> 02:15:23.435]  Just chatting with a young man, and he mentioned he worked for Tesla.
[02:15:23.475 --> 02:15:25.935]  I said, golly, have you ever met Elon?
[02:15:25.975 --> 02:15:27.096]  He said, oh, I work for him.
[02:15:27.756 --> 02:15:28.436]  Knows him well.
[02:15:28.596 --> 02:15:30.416]  I said, well, is he the real deal?
[02:15:30.476 --> 02:15:31.216]  And he said, no.
[02:15:31.436 --> 02:15:32.937]  He said he's an evil guy.
[02:15:33.797 --> 02:15:37.258]  He fired employees at a whim for no reason.
[02:15:38.278 --> 02:15:39.678]  People could not trust him.
[02:15:40.358 --> 02:15:41.718]  Totally unpredictable.
[02:15:42.319 --> 02:15:44.179]  Just a bad guy.
[02:15:44.947 --> 02:15:49.311]  And that, yeah, and it was so coincidental I'd run into him.
[02:15:49.391 --> 02:15:53.215]  I mean, you know, and I don't think he had any reason to lie.
[02:15:55.317 --> 02:15:58.480]  Well, he certainly got the backing of the most powerful money people on earth.
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:00.822]  So I think at the end of the day, that's the answer about Elon.
[02:16:01.683 --> 02:16:05.026]  And he's sent out there to try to fool us and act like he's our friend.
[02:16:05.046 --> 02:16:06.227]  I mean, I think that's really what's going on.
[02:16:07.853 --> 02:16:30.153]  I think he also may have mentioned he just ran a rough shot over the females, but that may have been something else I picked up in the, you know, who knows where, because I wasn't taking notes, but just the overall drift, and the guy was really sharp, really a sharp young man, and so I just don't think he had any reason to mislead me.
[02:16:31.374 --> 02:16:31.714]  I hear you.
[02:16:31.734 --> 02:16:33.075]  I wish I could talk to you all day, John.
[02:16:33.496 --> 02:16:34.336]  Sorry to Lisa.
[02:16:34.356 --> 02:16:34.977]  Sorry to Shane.
[02:16:35.017 --> 02:16:36.458]  I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:16:36.498 --> 02:16:36.838]  Central.
[02:16:36.898 --> 02:16:38.239]  Say their name and number if they want to do that.
[02:16:38.519 --> 02:16:40.501]  We'll call these callers back, get them back on air.
[02:16:41.081 --> 02:16:48.987]  We got a special guest host from Australia coming up on the other side, the known Troyer, in 55 Minutes, The War Room, 3 p.m.
[02:16:48.826 --> 02:17:02.826]   infowars.com/show Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[02:17:03.123 --> 02:17:05.443]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[02:17:05.784 --> 02:17:11.145]  Now, the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[02:17:11.585 --> 02:17:15.807]  The bad news is by Christmas, almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[02:17:16.087 --> 02:17:17.828]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[02:17:18.188 --> 02:17:22.329]  So now is the time to take action to support the InfoWar and get the biggest sales of the year.
[02:17:22.654 --> 02:17:28.277]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3, and BioTrue Selenium, and our Wake Up America award-winning coffee.
[02:17:28.558 --> 02:17:38.864]  And now, DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Refusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, so many other great products like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Vaz-O-Beats, Secret 12.
[02:17:39.584 --> 02:17:43.527]  They are all going to sell out in the next few weeks, or in the next month.
[02:17:43.726 --> 02:17:46.366]  Again, more stuff's gonna sell out today.
[02:17:46.366 --> 02:17:50.686]  So every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out at infowarestore.com.
[02:17:50.686 --> 02:17:57.405]   Promo code 1776 and you get an additional 10% off the already giant savings at infowarestore.com.
[02:17:57.405 --> 02:17:58.686]  Thank you so much for your support.
[02:17:58.686 --> 02:17:59.245]  God bless.
[02:17:59.245 --> 02:18:07.646]   Welcome to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show on this Tuesday, 29th of November broadcast.
[02:18:07.821 --> 02:18:11.003]  I'm your guest host, Maria Zee from ZeeMedia.com.
[02:18:11.023 --> 02:18:16.707]  That's Z-E-E-E-Media.com with three E's, just in case, because people always use two.
[02:18:16.787 --> 02:18:18.448]  It's good to be with you all today.
[02:18:19.048 --> 02:18:29.296]  We are absolutely, I mean the entire world is watching in shock and horror at the absolute atrocities happening to the Chinese people right now.
[02:18:30.096 --> 02:18:45.348]   You would have caught yesterday, Alex was covering a lot of what was happening, you know, the burning buildings, People being locked inside their homes, the doors being tied with wire, barricaded in, and then fires happening in these buildings.
[02:18:45.368 --> 02:18:46.870]  They're being burned alive.
[02:18:47.230 --> 02:18:49.632]  Children are being burned alive.
[02:18:49.652 --> 02:18:56.978]  You've got people starving and dying due to lack of availability of life-saving medications.
[02:18:57.399 --> 02:19:09.231]   And then you get Klaus Schwab, this absolute clown, coming out and telling everyone That the whole world needs to be like China, but we're not going to impose that.
[02:19:09.271 --> 02:19:11.833]  We don't recommend to impose that.
[02:19:12.333 --> 02:19:33.719]   Well, you may say that, Schwab, but when you're talking about the fact that you've penetrated all of the cabinets and praising your pet Trudeau, giving him a nice pat on the head for being such a good little slave, And listening to absolutely everything that you say.
[02:19:33.739 --> 02:19:39.463]  Of course, you're not imposing it openly, but every single one of your minions is.
[02:19:40.804 --> 02:19:55.895]  You know, in Australia, we had a senator, Senator Alex Antic, he's been on with Alex before, talking about the fact that he tried to get Australian politicians to disclose their ties to the World Economic Forum, and they refused.
[02:19:56.296 --> 02:19:57.997]  They actually stopped his motion.
[02:19:59.207 --> 02:20:10.339]  So, if your associations with the World Economic Forum are nothing to be ashamed of, or if you're not associated with them, why would you try and stop a motion like that?
[02:20:11.219 --> 02:20:20.389]  Well, it's because Klaus Schwab and anyone associated with the World Economic Forum endorses people burning alive in buildings.
[02:20:21.849 --> 02:20:25.951]  They endorse extreme human rights abuses.
[02:20:26.731 --> 02:20:31.753]  The fact that Klaus Schwab is saying, this is the perfect model for us, we all need to be more like this.
[02:20:32.133 --> 02:20:36.254]  He's literally telling the world, we want to burn you alive inside of buildings.
[02:20:36.575 --> 02:20:39.813]   We want to restrict It's everything that you do.
[02:20:40.333 --> 02:20:44.974]  And yes, there is a huge uprising in China at the moment and it's wonderful to see.
[02:20:45.375 --> 02:20:48.815]  But I wanted to ask the team to play some footage from Twitter.
[02:20:49.115 --> 02:20:56.097]  There's a clip that was uploaded by this really great account that's exposing a lot of what's happening in China.
[02:20:56.577 --> 02:21:05.119]  And this one is actually from March and it shows epidemic control staff wearing futuristic looking helmets.
[02:21:05.459 --> 02:21:09.202]  That actually monitor people on the street and monitor their temperature.
[02:21:09.882 --> 02:21:20.810]  And what the Chinese government is doing, and Dr Li Mingyan came on with me quite some time ago, warning about the traffic light system, warning about when your QR code goes red.
[02:21:22.512 --> 02:21:32.579]  What they're doing now is, if your QR code goes red, which the government can issue if you are disobeying them, it's got absolutely nothing to do with your health.
[02:21:32.699 --> 02:21:38.048]   It is literally Thinking for yourself, disagreeing with the CCP.
[02:21:38.969 --> 02:21:43.352]  If your QR code goes red, you're off to quarantine camp, buddy.
[02:21:43.372 --> 02:21:49.576]  And let's not even call it quarantine camp, these are concentration camps used to punish citizens.
[02:21:49.616 --> 02:21:52.618]  Here's the video now, if you can scroll down on that, team.
[02:21:53.379 --> 02:21:54.599]  This is unbelievable.
[02:21:54.860 --> 02:21:59.703]  So these helmets are actually monitoring the citizens, monitoring their body temperature.
[02:22:01.113 --> 02:22:10.040]  In the crowds, it's got an eight-hour battery, this device, and it monitors their temperature from up to five metres away.
[02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:11.421]  They're infrared cameras.
[02:22:12.783 --> 02:22:13.583]  Take a look at this.
[02:22:13.803 --> 02:22:21.250]  And this is the kind of police state that Schwab and every single person aligned with him wants to implement all over the world.
[02:22:23.231 --> 02:22:24.232]  This is unbelievable.
[02:22:24.272 --> 02:22:37.866]  But again, what they're trying to bring in really has nothing to do with your health because what's happening now in China is that citizens that are speaking out and trying to raise awareness on social media, the government is issuing them with a red QR code.
[02:22:38.507 --> 02:22:44.473]  Likewise, the people that are protesting are being issued with a red QR code.
[02:22:45.623 --> 02:22:48.925]  And that means that you essentially are locked out of society.
[02:22:49.245 --> 02:22:51.246]  Your bank accounts can be locked with that.
[02:22:51.546 --> 02:22:58.790]  I saw recently these people begging to be let back into society after they were banned on WeChat.
[02:22:58.810 --> 02:23:03.292]  A lot of people in China use WeChat for everything that they need to do.
[02:23:03.832 --> 02:23:05.313]  And this is what they do.
[02:23:05.353 --> 02:23:06.754]  They lock you out of society.
[02:23:07.654 --> 02:23:17.122]  And once you're issued with a red code, you can't participate in the economy until you've gone and served time in a quarantine camp at your expense.
[02:23:17.863 --> 02:23:20.405]  So they're constructing all these camps.
[02:23:20.445 --> 02:23:22.747]  There's more and more of them constantly popping up.
[02:23:23.047 --> 02:23:39.669]   And what is happening at the moment in China is truly an experiment to see how far they can push An incredibly oppressed people that are very used to being controlled, tracked, traced and all of the above by their government because this is what they want to do to you.
[02:23:41.149 --> 02:23:48.950]  When you watch the scenes out of China, you're watching their desired future for you and this applies to every country.
[02:23:49.770 --> 02:24:00.928]   It's not, you know, exclusive to just China because even Fauci said in a recent deposition that What they're seeing in China.
[02:24:01.188 --> 02:24:04.971]  This was his inspiration for the lockdowns.
[02:24:06.832 --> 02:24:09.594]  China was Fauci's inspiration.
[02:24:10.614 --> 02:24:14.697]  You're inspired by watching people being abused.
[02:24:14.717 --> 02:24:20.080]  You're inspired by watching people dying due to lack of medical care in camps.
[02:24:21.121 --> 02:24:23.562]  Conditions that we haven't seen since World War II.
[02:24:23.602 --> 02:24:25.844]  This is inspiring to you, Fauci?
[02:24:27.031 --> 02:24:30.874]  These people are sick, demented, evil human beings.
[02:24:31.615 --> 02:24:33.416]  And they need to be called out for what they are.
[02:24:33.756 --> 02:24:36.759]  And the problem that we have is we look at these people.
[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:45.286]  We look at people like Fauci and we say, yeah, you kill puppies and you're more than happy to see human beings being killed as well.
[02:24:45.306 --> 02:24:48.648]  And you're especially evil.
[02:24:48.668 --> 02:25:00.138]   But what we really need to recognise is that the rest of the politicians who have been penetrated by Schwab They are equally evil.
[02:25:00.198 --> 02:25:11.486]  They have the equal desire to see people suffer that maniacs like Schwab and Fauci do, because you have to be a maniac to align yourself with these people.
[02:25:11.846 --> 02:25:17.911]  No one in their right mind, no decent human being would see this and say, wow, that's inspiring.
[02:25:18.431 --> 02:25:23.095]  Look at this, how inspiring to see people being abused like this.
[02:25:23.155 --> 02:25:24.396]  We should do it everywhere.
[02:25:26.158 --> 02:25:26.818]  Who says that?
[02:25:28.759 --> 02:25:35.542]  There's another Twitter thread that I sent through to the team about these stormtroopers.
[02:25:35.582 --> 02:25:46.086]  This is from November the 29th in Guangzhou City, I hope I didn't butcher the pronunciation of that, facing off Chinese protesters last night.
[02:25:46.566 --> 02:26:01.212]   And, you know, it reminds me of scenes out of Melbourne when the Our very own police turned against us, and there are questions as to whether they were Australian police or not, or whether they were foreign.
[02:26:01.972 --> 02:26:05.673]  It seems like they were a foreign hired security company.
[02:26:06.073 --> 02:26:12.095]  No one's really 100% sure of this, but this reminds me of Melbourne.
[02:26:12.155 --> 02:26:26.679]   This reminds me of all of these people, and if you saw those scenes out of Melbourne, it was absolutely heartbreaking because you had Peaceful, innocent people kneeling in front of the police who were armed against their own citizens.
[02:26:27.339 --> 02:26:32.402]  And, you know, Daniel Andrews has just been re-elected.
[02:26:34.123 --> 02:26:40.026]  Daniel Andrews, who declared himself the dictator of Victoria, very much loves the CCP.
[02:26:41.047 --> 02:26:42.588]  Loves to see this kind of thing.
[02:26:42.688 --> 02:26:54.378]   And when you go back to the scenes that the whole world saw coming out of Australia and Melbourne, And see that really when they tell you that they are inspired by China, they're not joking.
[02:26:55.478 --> 02:27:00.702]  These people want to turn the entire world into a prison camp.
[02:27:02.783 --> 02:27:09.828]  But if they don't do it to you outright like this, there's some scenes out of Australia right there.
[02:27:09.888 --> 02:27:15.832]  This is what our people endured and we want to keep bringing that up because we forget very easily.
[02:27:17.481 --> 02:27:21.243]  People forget what they went through and I suppose they don't only forget.
[02:27:22.224 --> 02:27:24.846]  Remembering this every day of your life is not ideal.
[02:27:24.886 --> 02:27:27.047]  No one really wants to think about this all the time.
[02:27:27.367 --> 02:27:43.938]  But it's very, very important that we do remember these things and remember the people in our countries who suffered for the sake of doing what's right at the hands of power hungry people thinking that they're serving some sort of a greater cause.
[02:27:45.365 --> 02:27:49.707]  Never, ever forget what they did to us because next time it'll be worse.
[02:27:49.747 --> 02:27:51.948]  We'll continue right on the other side of this break.
[02:27:52.189 --> 02:27:54.130]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:54.190 --> 02:28:14.452]   You know, the reason why the globalists made us, uh, not, I mean, I don't hate the Chinese, but, but made the world really Dislike the Chinese people, some even hate them, is because they didn't want outrage to happen when they knew that they were going to be doing this to them.
[02:28:14.472 --> 02:28:19.200]  Because this is the greatest social experiment that we have seen to date.
[02:28:20.149 --> 02:28:31.105]  Of the most gross civil rights abuses and this is why I'm so passionate about this because I know that if they successfully do this to millions of people in China, they'll successfully do it to you and me.
[02:28:31.786 --> 02:28:36.813]  Every single human being that is suffering under the hands of these maniacs is suffering together.
[02:28:37.333 --> 02:28:55.030]  And so I just want to ask everyone that's listening to really pray for the people of China because what's happening right now and you know yesterday the CCP deployed a whole host of Twitter bots to fill Twitter with sexually explicit content to try and cover up what's actually happening in China.
[02:28:56.112 --> 02:29:04.695]  They don't want this news out there and Chinese citizens are contacting agencies like the Epoch Times news agencies and saying, thank you so much.
[02:29:04.775 --> 02:29:07.476]  Every bit of awareness that you're that you're raising is helping us.
[02:29:07.896 --> 02:29:10.957]  And so we really want to remember the Chinese people right now.
[02:29:10.977 --> 02:29:12.998]  I mean, just look at what they're going through.
[02:29:13.018 --> 02:29:13.798]  It's unbelievable.
[02:29:13.838 --> 02:29:16.119]  But right now, this is just in.
[02:29:17.208 --> 02:29:23.470]  Canadian Freedom Convoy, the Chinese are taking some inspiration from the previous Freedom Convoy.
[02:29:23.490 --> 02:29:32.673]  They're actually blockading roads, honking non-stop, and this is wonderful to see them pushing back in whatever way they can.
[02:29:32.693 --> 02:29:35.874]  I mean, really, this is their last fight.
[02:29:36.194 --> 02:29:42.916]  When you look at how far they've come and how they continue to lock people out of society, they can turn their codes red.
[02:29:43.596 --> 02:29:44.137]  Remotely.
[02:29:44.197 --> 02:29:46.418]  They don't even have to be in their presence, of course.
[02:29:46.478 --> 02:29:47.659]  I mean, it's via your phone.
[02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:49.360]  But look at this.
[02:29:49.520 --> 02:29:51.181]  Look, this is disgusting.
[02:29:51.402 --> 02:29:54.984]  These are groups of people bashing unarmed citizens.
[02:29:55.825 --> 02:30:11.666]   And this is what societies turn into when you give people that don't normally have positions of authority When you give them responsibility and they feel like they're somehow doing something good for society, this is what happens to them.
[02:30:11.887 --> 02:30:16.271]  It's what happened in Nazi Germany and it is what is going to happen if this continues.
[02:30:16.291 --> 02:30:26.262]  I've been talking a lot about Australian legislation that's been introduced and it's important for the whole world to understand and keep an eye out because they will do the same to your country.
[02:30:26.952 --> 02:30:40.256]  Here in Australia they've written into legislation that authorised COVID officers can come into your home without a warrant, break into your home, take your property, take you, take you to a quarantine facility where you'll be forcefully injected.
[02:30:40.316 --> 02:30:46.258]  This is real legislation that exists in Australia and it applies pretty much to every single state.
[02:30:47.418 --> 02:31:16.000]   So when you see scenes like the one that we just saw in China, when you see scenes like that, And you hear Schwab saying, China's an inspiration, and you see that they're writing things into legislation that allow for authorised officers, like those officers that we just saw in that last clip, grabbing a citizen and beating them because they're on a power trip over something that doesn't even exist, isn't even killing people.
[02:31:17.239 --> 02:31:23.080]  And when I say it doesn't exist, I mean to the extent that they're talking about and we're not even sure really what it is.
[02:31:23.120 --> 02:31:24.581]  All we know is it's a buyer weapon.
[02:31:26.561 --> 02:31:29.002]  Look at this extreme abuse of power.
[02:31:29.062 --> 02:31:34.663]  This is what happens when you give power to people that don't normally have it.
[02:31:35.043 --> 02:32:02.324]   And this is the same thing that's been written into legislation in Australia so that regular people who are brainwashed with the propaganda I just watched a poll yesterday about almost 50% of Americans during the heat of all the lockdowns and everything were wishing that unvaccinated people would be punished.
[02:32:02.504 --> 02:32:08.226]  Almost 30% thought that unvaccinated parents should have their children taken away from them.
[02:32:08.506 --> 02:32:14.749]  If they managed to create that sort of rage again in people and you don't think it's hard, they did it once.
[02:32:15.911 --> 02:32:21.955]  It won't be exactly the same, it'll be a new tactic, but the tactic of public health threat works best.
[02:32:22.015 --> 02:32:22.875]  They've figured that out.
[02:32:24.316 --> 02:32:33.502]  So you don't think that authorised officers who were just frothing at the mouth last time to see the unvaccinated punished wouldn't behave exactly like that?
[02:32:35.803 --> 02:32:42.087]  They are writing this into law for a reason and when they tell you, we want to be just like China, they're not kidding.
[02:32:42.850 --> 02:32:43.530]  They're not kidding.
[02:32:43.590 --> 02:32:50.812]  So when the Chinese right now are fighting for their very lives, it's not only their lives that they're fighting for, it's actually for ours too.
[02:32:51.972 --> 02:32:55.873]  This is such a huge stand that these people are taking.
[02:32:57.433 --> 02:33:01.674]  Watching these scenes out of Australia, this is Australian footage from last year.
[02:33:02.194 --> 02:33:04.494]  It's unbelievable and you can see the parallel.
[02:33:05.155 --> 02:33:20.741]   And I'm not saying that what we went through is worse than what others went through necessarily, but you have to admit, That watching police turn on innocent people, armed, shooting at them with rubber bullets, that is something that we have not seen in the West.
[02:33:21.562 --> 02:33:23.364]  It really is like scenes out of China.
[02:33:24.164 --> 02:33:33.332]  And, you know, I'll never forget, the police officer that was in charge that day said something to the effect of, let's get them boys.
[02:33:35.253 --> 02:33:38.736]  He saw the people as, I don't know, game?
[02:33:40.057 --> 02:33:40.878]  To be played with?
[02:33:43.021 --> 02:33:46.483]  He saw the people as targets.
[02:33:48.224 --> 02:33:49.645]  And it's not very hard.
[02:33:50.065 --> 02:33:55.429]  And, you know, in the last segment, Alex and his guests were talking about the division in society.
[02:33:55.449 --> 02:34:04.394]  It's not very hard to create that hatred with a false threat because people lose their ability to think clearly when they think they're in danger.
[02:34:06.055 --> 02:34:08.697]  It's not very hard for them to create something like that again.
[02:34:09.097 --> 02:34:13.608]   Who knows if they deploy Different waves next time.
[02:34:14.289 --> 02:34:17.873]  5G waves reacting with whatever's been injected into people.
[02:34:17.933 --> 02:34:18.734]  We just don't know.
[02:34:19.996 --> 02:34:23.300]  We don't know what that's going to do to people and that's just the reality of it.
[02:34:23.620 --> 02:34:25.302]  Some people may think that's too far.
[02:34:25.622 --> 02:34:28.225]  Go and watch my latest video with Dr David Nixon.
[02:34:28.266 --> 02:34:30.989]  It's up on Bandot Video and tell me if you think it's too far.
[02:34:32.478 --> 02:34:42.509]  Tell me if you think that footage of robot arms assembling under the microscope in the Pfizer vials is too far to imagine that 5G would be able to affect people's behaviour.
[02:34:42.529 --> 02:34:51.859]  So what we saw last time when they weren't all injected, God help us, God only knows what they'll achieve next time and we have to be prepared for that.
[02:34:53.624 --> 02:34:58.065]  Because it's not only the authorities that will turn on the people.
[02:34:58.206 --> 02:35:01.967]  As you can see, these authorised officers are turning on the Chinese people.
[02:35:02.467 --> 02:35:04.087]  They're not necessarily police.
[02:35:04.808 --> 02:35:08.729]  They've just been given a suit and now they are exercising their power.
[02:35:10.349 --> 02:35:12.670]  And the globalists understand human psychology.
[02:35:13.550 --> 02:35:14.291]  They really do.
[02:35:16.051 --> 02:35:21.333]  And they understand how to tap into the part of the mind that seeks to control other people.
[02:35:22.509 --> 02:35:27.251]  They understand how to sell that to others because they spend every day doing that themselves.
[02:35:29.131 --> 02:35:32.212]  So we must not underestimate these people and what they're capable of.
[02:35:32.612 --> 02:35:41.215]  And when they tell us they want the world to be like China, we better take them seriously because everything that they tell us, they tell us in advance and they mean it.
[02:35:42.076 --> 02:35:47.517]  And as you've seen, everything that they've said, they go ahead and they do.
[02:35:47.818 --> 02:35:52.039]  When they war game things, eventually we see those things happening.
[02:35:54.008 --> 02:35:54.848]  Event 201?
[02:35:55.268 --> 02:35:56.208]  Oh, COVID.
[02:35:57.649 --> 02:35:58.549]  Cyber Polygon?
[02:35:58.849 --> 02:36:00.029]  Oh, global shutdown.
[02:36:00.629 --> 02:36:04.190]  Can't access anything without a digital vaccine, they say.
[02:36:05.510 --> 02:36:10.912]  And we know that they're launching the Global Health Pass, and we know that the WHO is meeting next month.
[02:36:11.212 --> 02:36:21.654]  Again, all these meetings happening in secret about this Global Health Pass, so that they can do this to you, switch you to red, force you into quarantine, and so much more.
[02:36:23.965 --> 02:36:30.757]  On the other side of this break, we're going to talk about the Balenciaga scandal and I want to explain how this all ties in together.
[02:36:31.419 --> 02:36:33.182]  I'll see you in just a moment.
[02:36:34.178 --> 02:36:43.647]  You know, if we didn't have broadcasts like this one, if we didn't have Info Wars, if we didn't have independent media, we would not be aware of everything that's happening in the world.
[02:36:43.787 --> 02:36:47.791]  There is not a peep in the mainstream media about the atrocities that are happening in China.
[02:36:48.211 --> 02:36:54.197]  And there hasn't been a peep in the mainstream media about what is happening or what happened with Balenciaga.
[02:36:55.106 --> 02:37:18.854]  And the reason for that is because the same people that are aiming to control the world through complete and utter destruction that they want for you and your family, to starve you, to deny you basic things like water, they're telling us to reduce our water consumption, drink less water, use less heating, oh, put an extra jumper on.
[02:37:18.874 --> 02:37:34.419]   Eat the bugs, eat crickets, while we gather At a climate conference that we arrived in 400 jets in and ate meat, but you peasant, you're going to eat crickets.
[02:37:36.261 --> 02:37:37.883]  And the media doesn't say a thing.
[02:37:38.884 --> 02:37:44.971]  The media parades them around like, oh, look at all these leaders at the climate conference and in the next breath.
[02:37:45.700 --> 02:37:49.582]  They'll tell you that you need to reduce your water consumption.
[02:37:50.022 --> 02:37:51.143]  They just don't care.
[02:37:51.203 --> 02:37:53.504]  It is so blatant, so in your face right now.
[02:37:53.925 --> 02:37:57.246]  And this is exactly what happened with Balenciaga.
[02:37:58.047 --> 02:38:07.152]  I've sent the team a whole heap of photos that I want to go through because I did a little bit of digging and I want to give credit to this Twitter account, Curious Light.
[02:38:07.893 --> 02:38:14.236]  A lot of people are doing fantastic work out there, but they're not necessarily very well known.
[02:38:14.736 --> 02:38:24.040]  So if you're one of those people, just know that there are people that have a platform that are grateful for the work that you do, that helps us get the truth out there.
[02:38:25.501 --> 02:38:31.103]  You may not be at the front of a screen, but you are a silent hero, perhaps.
[02:38:31.924 --> 02:38:37.126]  And every single person that is standing for freedom truly is a hero, and I mean that wholeheartedly.
[02:38:38.809 --> 02:38:40.551]  But you've got photo one.
[02:38:40.571 --> 02:38:42.613]  I mean, most people have seen this.
[02:38:42.733 --> 02:38:45.937]  It is absolutely disgraceful and shocking.
[02:38:45.957 --> 02:38:48.559]  A child with a teddy bear.
[02:38:49.781 --> 02:38:50.381]  Bondage.
[02:38:51.723 --> 02:38:55.827]  You know, I can't even begin to explain everything that's wrong with this photo.
[02:38:55.847 --> 02:38:56.868]  You've got dog collars.
[02:38:57.208 --> 02:39:13.736]   You know, I can't understand how the photographer In photo two, he said, oh, he's been lynched over the bondage-themed campaign for featuring children, and the Spanish fashion house is responsible for the images, not him.
[02:39:13.896 --> 02:39:15.336]  Buddy, you took the photos!
[02:39:16.136 --> 02:39:21.698]  You sat there and said, yeah, okay, I'm going to take these photos of a child with bondage featured.
[02:39:22.779 --> 02:39:24.879]  It's everyone playing the blame game now.
[02:39:25.139 --> 02:39:27.260]  You were all fine as it was happening.
[02:39:29.051 --> 02:39:32.473]  None of you stopped and said, hang on a minute, this is a little bit too far.
[02:39:32.493 --> 02:39:42.377]  Okay, maybe you didn't see the court documents about the case where we wanted to allow for child pornography.
[02:39:44.178 --> 02:39:53.762]  Maybe you didn't see the books in the background that support pedophilia and rituals with children and God knows what.
[02:39:53.782 --> 02:39:54.742]  Maybe you didn't see that.
[02:39:55.082 --> 02:39:56.743]  But you did see the bondage bear.
[02:39:58.442 --> 02:40:02.764]  So I don't buy this nonsense of, oh, you know, someone else is responsible.
[02:40:02.784 --> 02:40:13.948]  He's made a statement anyway in Picture Three, and he's saying, oh, you know, following the hundreds of hate mails and messages that I received, I feel compelled to make this statement.
[02:40:14.068 --> 02:40:22.651]  I'm not in a position to comment on Balenciaga's choices, but I must stress that I was not entitled in whatsoever manner to either choose the products nor the models nor the combination of the same.
[02:40:22.691 --> 02:40:23.752]  You can say no!
[02:40:25.529 --> 02:40:34.975]  You know, this reminds me of all of the leaders, leaders, public health officials and these insane criminals that push the injections.
[02:40:35.335 --> 02:40:44.341]  If they at any point come out and say, oh, we didn't know, which is likely, you know, when more truth comes out that they'll do that.
[02:40:44.441 --> 02:40:45.161]  Oh, we didn't know.
[02:40:45.621 --> 02:40:46.222]  Yes, you did.
[02:40:47.634 --> 02:40:52.097]  You can't tell me as a photographer that you're sitting there, oh, I had no choice.
[02:40:52.117 --> 02:40:52.817]  Yeah, you did!
[02:40:52.857 --> 02:40:53.858]  You pressed the button!
[02:40:53.878 --> 02:40:58.041]  You see a child there in front of you with bondage and you don't, you, I didn't have a choice.
[02:40:58.481 --> 02:41:00.022]  You could have said, guys, this is wrong.
[02:41:00.102 --> 02:41:01.423]  I don't care about my paycheck.
[02:41:01.483 --> 02:41:02.363]  I can't do this.
[02:41:04.485 --> 02:41:08.187]  And it's the same thing with all the murderous doctors that are administering the death shots.
[02:41:08.247 --> 02:41:09.068]  Oh, I didn't have a choice.
[02:41:09.368 --> 02:41:10.829]  Yes, you damn well did.
[02:41:13.206 --> 02:41:14.927]  Every single person had a choice.
[02:41:15.507 --> 02:41:19.709]  And all of these authorised COVID officers that go and beat people up on the street.
[02:41:19.769 --> 02:41:20.469]  I didn't have a choice.
[02:41:20.489 --> 02:41:21.510]  The government told me to.
[02:41:21.810 --> 02:41:22.250]  Bollocks.
[02:41:24.912 --> 02:41:26.973]  Every single person has a choice to do what is right.
[02:41:27.053 --> 02:41:29.474]  And don't tell me that you didn't know what's wrong and right.
[02:41:29.754 --> 02:41:30.874]  We all have a conscience.
[02:41:32.655 --> 02:41:33.836]  These people are sick.
[02:41:33.876 --> 02:41:34.716]  They make me sick.
[02:41:36.357 --> 02:41:44.721]   But the photographer, Loda Volkova, sorry, the designer, She's one of the main stylists in Balenciaga.
[02:41:45.602 --> 02:42:01.870]  She's been one of the main stylists since 2014, has a relationship with an accused pedophile, and she's also done work with Adidas and many other brands.
[02:42:02.090 --> 02:42:05.712]  I just want to go through some of the photos on this woman's Instagram account.
[02:42:06.032 --> 02:42:09.974]  If you go to photo5team and we'll start there and we'll just go through them.
[02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:14.681]  This is, you know, it's very disturbing stuff.
[02:42:16.461 --> 02:42:27.564]  And when you think about a brand choosing to partner with someone like this, you might say, oh, well, that's artistic or, you know, we really want to push the boundaries, but let's keep going.
[02:42:27.584 --> 02:42:30.024]  In photo six, you've got Sex Witch.
[02:42:32.465 --> 02:42:40.241]   I mean, you start to see, you start to get a picture Of what this person's really about when you keep going through the photos.
[02:42:40.281 --> 02:42:47.726]  In photo 7, she's got all these very young males or male looking people.
[02:42:47.766 --> 02:42:59.074]  In photo 8 as well, photo 8 is it looks like a young boy dressed as a girl or a young girl that is made to look boyish.
[02:42:59.654 --> 02:43:01.655]  She's really got an obsession with children.
[02:43:01.695 --> 02:43:03.076]  Photo 9 is very similar.
[02:43:03.517 --> 02:43:17.588]   Very boyish looking A person dressed as a girl and this is the whole transgender aim to really remove your gender, to remove your God-given identity.
[02:43:17.929 --> 02:43:24.593]  This is what these people are about and I will explain why, but I really want people to get a good picture of this stylist in photo 10.
[02:43:26.294 --> 02:43:27.715]  This is absolutely sickening.
[02:43:28.055 --> 02:43:29.356]  She's got this photo of this.
[02:43:29.857 --> 02:43:31.338]  I mean, it is so creepy.
[02:43:31.778 --> 02:43:35.441]  It's like, I don't know if it's a child or a doll or meant to look like both.
[02:43:35.501 --> 02:43:41.345]  This lifeless child that looks like it's struggling but has a smile on its face.
[02:43:41.365 --> 02:43:45.148]  It's really, really sick stuff.
[02:43:46.449 --> 02:43:51.393]  In photo 11, a young little boy with heels on.
[02:43:54.460 --> 02:44:10.153]  Don't tell me you don't know who you're associating with when you go and take photos with this stylist who is obsessed with displaying little children in a sexualized fashion on their Instagram.
[02:44:12.495 --> 02:44:14.356]  Photo 12 is up on the screen now.
[02:44:14.376 --> 02:44:23.364]  I mean, this is all from this woman's Instagram page, this Lotte Volkova.
[02:44:24.745 --> 02:44:31.208]  She's also done work with Adidas, and as you can see in photo 13 here, obsessed with bondage.
[02:44:32.769 --> 02:44:34.510]  That's very, very clear here, you know?
[02:44:34.910 --> 02:44:39.253]  Really, just look at the dehumanization of people.
[02:44:40.633 --> 02:44:42.554]  And it's, of course, under the guise of art.
[02:44:42.614 --> 02:44:44.536]  Everything's done under the guise of something else.
[02:44:44.656 --> 02:44:48.137]  Oh, human rights, art, you know, expression.
[02:44:49.118 --> 02:44:50.299]  There's no expression here.
[02:44:50.359 --> 02:44:52.840]  This is dehumanization.
[02:44:54.321 --> 02:45:02.987]  You saw that video, probably, of that young woman walking a man down the street with a dog collar and humiliating him.
[02:45:03.007 --> 02:45:04.928]  And this is what it is.
[02:45:04.988 --> 02:45:08.951]  It's about humiliating people.
[02:45:09.111 --> 02:45:11.272]  It's about dehumanizing them.
[02:45:11.392 --> 02:45:13.153]  It's about changing gender roles.
[02:45:14.714 --> 02:45:16.215]  Elevating women above men.
[02:45:16.235 --> 02:45:18.837]  And it doesn't work.
[02:45:19.398 --> 02:45:48.218]   It doesn't work to elevate women above men, number one, because Neither of us are better than one another, but number two, because they know that the destabilization of the family unit, trying to challenge the man's role in the household, and they have successfully done so, emasculating men for generations, making them too afraid to leave the house.
[02:45:49.608 --> 02:45:54.232]  They know that that is what leads to a weaker generation, both men and women.
[02:45:56.013 --> 02:46:03.099]  They know that traditional family values are what is required for a healthy society, so they will do everything that they can to destroy them.
[02:46:03.119 --> 02:46:15.529]  I have a few more images to go through on the other side of this break, and then I'm going to tie this all together and explain to you why every single one of these things matters and how they're related.
[02:46:15.869 --> 02:46:16.490]  We'll be right back.
[02:46:17.972 --> 02:46:33.915]  Thank you to everyone who supports the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars, Owen Troy, all the amazing presenters on this broadcast, and I encourage everyone who hasn't supported InfoWars, head to InfoWarsStore.com and have a look at some of their products.
[02:46:34.155 --> 02:46:44.276]  These people are independently funded, and that means that they're never influenced by Big Pharma or any external organizations when they bring you the truth, and that is so powerful.
[02:46:44.296 --> 02:46:51.294]   I want to talk a little bit more On this Lotta Volkova, the Balenciaga stylist.
[02:46:51.955 --> 02:46:57.560]  I want to get the team to bring up a really disturbing video and I'm warning people in advance, it is disturbing.
[02:46:58.461 --> 02:47:01.124]  But I'm sure that it's nothing that the audience can't handle.
[02:47:01.164 --> 02:47:03.286]  The Balenciaga red bag video.
[02:47:03.306 --> 02:47:05.769]  If we can get that video up right now.
[02:47:07.927 --> 02:47:10.628]  Can we do a what's in your bag?
[02:47:10.668 --> 02:47:12.769]  Yeah, can we do a what's in the bag, please?
[02:47:12.809 --> 02:47:16.511]  Should I hold it for you and you can take things out?
[02:47:16.331 --> 02:47:18.331]  can we do what's in the bag please?
[02:47:18.331 --> 02:47:21.331]  should I hold it for you and you can take the things out?
[02:47:21.331 --> 02:47:24.331]   yeah look at that, blood in the bag
[02:47:24.331 --> 02:47:31.331]   there's like a, like when she starts to cry like then when she's gonna pee, I don't know
[02:47:31.331 --> 02:47:40.331]   then when she's boring, uh, she's gonna want to lick yeah, everything about school
[02:47:44.331 --> 02:47:49.331]   a red bag with a baby that he's carrying and things, items inside covered in blood
[02:47:49.746 --> 02:47:52.367]  This is what Balenciaga stands for, I guess.
[02:47:52.387 --> 02:47:55.829]  If you go to photo 14, the team can bring that one up.
[02:47:56.189 --> 02:48:03.753]  This Lotta Volkova posted this disturbing image with the hashtag Moloch.
[02:48:04.895 --> 02:48:11.719]  For those who don't know, that's an ancient pagan god that they sacrifice children to.
[02:48:11.799 --> 02:48:17.703]  And in photo 15, she's written, devil worshippers perform gruesome rituals in the forest.
[02:48:18.652 --> 02:48:19.792]  Just matter of fact.
[02:48:20.413 --> 02:48:21.213]  Well, we know.
[02:48:21.233 --> 02:48:22.253]  We know, Lotta.
[02:48:22.293 --> 02:48:22.953]  We actually know.
[02:48:22.993 --> 02:48:23.954]  But here you are telling us.
[02:48:23.994 --> 02:48:26.774]  In photo 16, the devil made her do it.
[02:48:27.434 --> 02:48:30.735]  Very, very disturbing images on this woman's Instagram.
[02:48:30.775 --> 02:48:34.256]  And it is very, very clear to us who these people are serving.
[02:48:34.296 --> 02:48:39.938]  You don't do stuff like this and just put it out there blatantly in people's faces.
[02:48:40.118 --> 02:48:43.199]  Oh, people, devil worshippers doing rituals in the forest.
[02:48:43.259 --> 02:48:49.175]   And all of these statements that this person is making Are not a coincidence.
[02:48:50.536 --> 02:48:52.357]  But it doesn't stop at Balenciaga.
[02:48:52.657 --> 02:48:55.118]  Photo 18, if the team can bring that up.
[02:48:57.599 --> 02:48:59.180]  Gucci's creative director.
[02:49:00.541 --> 02:49:02.462]  Alessandro Michele's IG page.
[02:49:03.923 --> 02:49:09.145]  And these disgusting photos that are on the page.
[02:49:09.546 --> 02:49:09.786]  Photo 18. 19.
[02:49:12.805 --> 02:49:15.207]  And 20 if the team can just go through that.
[02:49:16.268 --> 02:49:17.289]  You know, nude babies.
[02:49:18.430 --> 02:49:20.011]  Men with nude babies.
[02:49:21.372 --> 02:49:22.653]  That's Gucci as well, guys.
[02:49:22.693 --> 02:49:24.895]  It's not only Balenciaga.
[02:49:24.955 --> 02:49:26.896]  Every single one of these people is involved.
[02:49:26.936 --> 02:49:33.141]  If you just go to photo 21, this is something that a very sharp individual spotted in the Balenciaga photo shoot.
[02:49:34.542 --> 02:49:35.023]  Baal.
[02:49:35.924 --> 02:49:37.445]  B-double-A-L.
[02:49:38.706 --> 02:49:42.707]  And this is exactly what this entire thing is about.
[02:49:43.988 --> 02:49:46.308]  This is what civil rights abuses are about.
[02:49:46.348 --> 02:49:48.609]  This is what human rights abuses are about.
[02:49:48.649 --> 02:49:50.609]  This is what abusing children is about.
[02:49:50.629 --> 02:49:55.931]  It all goes back to this cult that is running the shots behind the scenes.
[02:49:57.191 --> 02:50:09.895]   And now they're just doing this blatantly in your faces, probably because their Lord told them That they need to do, put these things into the photo shoot.
[02:50:09.955 --> 02:50:24.127]  They're directed in certain things that they need to do out in the open because if you've noticed over time, where you used to get symbolism in one music video or some symbolism in a movie or an album cover and everyone used to go, oh my goodness, look at this, it's everywhere now.
[02:50:25.408 --> 02:50:33.895]  You look at the big rappers, big stars, and I'll talk about Kim Kardashian in a moment as well, even though I really don't want to.
[02:50:35.154 --> 02:50:40.816]  Because this person contributes absolutely nothing productive to society, as none of them do.
[02:50:42.076 --> 02:50:45.758]  You look at all of them and their stuff is littered with symbolism.
[02:50:46.998 --> 02:50:48.059]  And there's a reason for that.
[02:50:49.419 --> 02:50:54.641]  It is because they serve one purpose, which is to promote Satan.
[02:50:56.371 --> 02:50:57.151]  It's very simple.
[02:50:57.171 --> 02:51:04.872]  If you look at Kim Kardashian's pathetic response on photo 22, if the team can bring that up from her story.
[02:51:05.253 --> 02:51:13.794]  I've been quiet for the past few days, not because I haven't been disgusted and outraged by the recent Balenciaga campaigns, but because I wanted an opportunity to speak to them.
[02:51:14.894 --> 02:51:21.215]  She's been shaken by the disturbing images apparently, and the safety of children must be held with the highest regard.
[02:51:22.095 --> 02:51:25.636]  Then she appreciates their removal of the campaigns and apology.
[02:51:26.477 --> 02:51:35.042]  And in speaking with them, she believes they understand the seriousness of the issue and will take the necessary measures for this to never happen again.
[02:51:36.223 --> 02:51:40.866]  And then Kim will go on dressing like this.
[02:51:40.886 --> 02:51:43.928]  Oh, I believe they've taken it seriously.
[02:51:43.968 --> 02:51:48.231]  Yet you also dress in a way that promotes dehumanization.
[02:51:49.472 --> 02:51:54.755]  You also promote and will continue to promote their product.
[02:51:55.515 --> 02:51:55.895]  You will.
[02:51:56.216 --> 02:51:58.698]  This is the most pathetic response.
[02:51:59.979 --> 02:52:11.669]  And I only bring this person up because she has such an impact on so many young women in society because people have bought the lie that these globalists have sold them about what the world really is about.
[02:52:12.990 --> 02:52:23.899]  You know, the one thing that I'm grateful for over the past two years, because I always look for things to be grateful for, is that so much has been exposed that was wrong with the world.
[02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:30.142]  And where people are being pushed to pick a side.
[02:52:31.003 --> 02:52:32.184]  Will you pick the side of good?
[02:52:32.944 --> 02:52:34.125]  Will you pick the side of evil?
[02:52:34.165 --> 02:52:42.690]  Are you going to pick the side, if the team can bring up photo 17, I'm sure many people have seen this depiction of children being sacrificed to Moloch or Baal.
[02:52:44.671 --> 02:52:45.712]  Are you going to pick this side?
[02:52:45.732 --> 02:52:52.516]  Or are you going to pick the side that works to defend children?
[02:52:55.238 --> 02:52:55.938]  Defend liberty.
[02:52:58.027 --> 02:52:59.428]  Defend what's good and right.
[02:53:00.208 --> 02:53:04.330]  I mean, the fact that people even think that this isn't really happening.
[02:53:05.390 --> 02:53:16.175]  When things like this come out from Balenciaga and we see the blatant symbolism, not even symbolism now, just, which it's just in your face.
[02:53:16.195 --> 02:53:20.317]  It kind of tells you, no, it actually is happening.
[02:53:21.958 --> 02:53:25.119]  They've been doing child sacrifice for thousands of years.
[02:53:25.680 --> 02:53:26.881]  What makes us think they've stopped now?
[02:53:26.941 --> 02:53:28.181]  What, because we're civilised?
[02:53:30.402 --> 02:53:31.583]  Well, we're so civilised.
[02:53:32.444 --> 02:53:38.367]  We're so civilised that we're locking people up in buildings and not letting them out when they're burning.
[02:53:39.127 --> 02:53:45.550]  Because COVID is, it's better for them to die burning than potentially catch the sniffles.
[02:53:46.851 --> 02:53:47.912]  That's how civilised we are.
[02:53:49.372 --> 02:54:03.673]   We're so civilised that we're going to shoot at our own people We're so civilised that we're going to take people that have done nothing other than speak their minds to quarantine camps.
[02:54:05.894 --> 02:54:07.315]  And who is behind all of this?
[02:54:08.555 --> 02:54:12.356]  Who is driving that type of behaviour?
[02:54:14.397 --> 02:54:20.058]  What you just saw on your screen, you saw the Tower of Babel there, I think.
[02:54:21.879 --> 02:54:24.300]  And that is exactly the system that we're heading into now.
[02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:25.360]  It's a system of Babylon.
[02:54:27.273 --> 02:54:29.854]  And this is, people need to take this very seriously.
[02:54:29.894 --> 02:54:31.735]  You need to decide what side are you on.
[02:54:33.576 --> 02:54:41.879]  Because any corporations in this world that are not speaking out about this right now, they're in on it.
[02:54:42.399 --> 02:54:49.762]  This is one of the biggest scandals, or should be, excuse me, of our time.
[02:54:54.184 --> 02:54:59.895]   This should be something that every single Mainstream media outlet is speaking about.
[02:55:02.036 --> 02:55:02.976]  Child pornography.
[02:55:07.338 --> 02:55:09.158]  Child pornography in your faces.
[02:55:10.239 --> 02:55:19.722]  Every single media outlet should be talking about whether Lotta Volkova, the Balenciaga stylist, is fit to continue being their stylist.
[02:55:20.903 --> 02:55:28.275]   Every single media, mainstream media outlet should be telling you To re-evaluate your decisions to support these people.
[02:55:30.556 --> 02:55:31.816]  And yet they haven't said a word.
[02:55:32.856 --> 02:55:33.436]  And they won't.
[02:55:34.197 --> 02:55:44.159]  Because the same people that fund Balenciaga and fund them to keep doing this are the same people that are funding the media that isn't telling you that right now people are dying in China.
[02:55:44.419 --> 02:55:47.640]  That isn't telling you that Klaus Schwab and Co want to do it to you.
[02:55:47.660 --> 02:55:53.182]  That isn't telling you about all the laws that are passing to make it possible for them to do it to you.
[02:55:56.380 --> 02:55:57.720]  The people have to save themselves.
[02:55:59.561 --> 02:56:05.722]  No corporation, no so-called leader is coming to save us and the only way is through mass awakening.
[02:56:07.102 --> 02:56:09.863]  So I want to thank everyone that's watched this today.
[02:56:10.883 --> 02:56:12.363]  Share this information with everyone.
[02:56:12.523 --> 02:56:13.803]  Share InfoWars with everyone.
[02:56:14.023 --> 02:56:15.164]  Share Zmedia with everyone.
[02:56:16.764 --> 02:56:21.765]  If you're not in my Telegram, I provide regular news updates around the clock.
[02:56:23.075 --> 02:56:26.518]  Z Media is the address you need to go to with three E's.
[02:56:27.238 --> 02:56:35.724]  And again, I'm just, I'm so grateful for everyone standing on the right side of freedom right now, on the right side of truth, on the right side of history.
[02:56:36.585 --> 02:56:38.226]  Every single one of you is a hero.
[02:56:38.546 --> 02:56:39.347]  Don't ever forget it.
[02:56:39.787 --> 02:56:41.008]  These people are lunatics.
[02:56:41.709 --> 02:56:45.371]  They want to harm you and the world needs to know about it.
[02:56:45.472 --> 02:56:49.014]  And you, the person watching, plays the most crucial role in that.
[02:56:49.054 --> 02:56:50.055]  Thank you for joining me today.
[02:56:49.875 --> 02:57:10.674]  I'll see you next week.
[02:57:10.687 --> 02:57:11.527]  I got some bad news.
[02:57:11.768 --> 02:57:22.838]  I thought we had enough free gifts of books and films and t-shirts and DVDs and all the rest of it with every order to keep it going at least until early December.
[02:57:23.158 --> 02:57:23.759]  Sorry, can't.
[02:57:24.339 --> 02:57:25.080]  They've done the numbers.
[02:57:25.100 --> 02:57:28.003]  The current sales rates will be sold out by about 3 a.m.
[02:57:28.803 --> 02:57:29.404]  on Wednesday.
[02:57:30.545 --> 02:57:38.768]   So, tomorrow night at midnight, The free gift on top of up to 60% off and double patriot points will end.
[02:57:39.068 --> 02:57:41.830]  You'll still get up to 60% off with promo code 7076.
[02:57:41.930 --> 02:57:51.134]  We'll keep the blowout sale going on DNA Force Plus and Vitamin Mineral Fusion and Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula and Super Mel Vitality and Ultra 12 and Basil Beets and all of it.
