[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:00.690]  It's all over.
[00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.833]  New York Times, Washington Post, it's so wonderful.
[00:00:06.556 --> 00:00:09.559]  WEF slash UN, they've now officially merged a month ago.
[00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.322]  They publicly merged.
[00:00:13.383 --> 00:00:16.586]  WEF-UN call for total, total.
[00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:18.202]  Total!
[00:00:18.862 --> 00:00:27.965]  World Economic Forum, Davos Group, and the UN call for total ban on private car ownership.
[00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:28.985]  Let me read that again.
[00:00:29.565 --> 00:00:37.447]  World Economic Forum, UN call for total ban on private car ownership.
[00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:42.329]  Launching next phase of Great Reset Collapse.
[00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:52.529]   And when you read the articles in the press release by the WEF and the UN, They say it does not matter what governments do, we are cutting off the power.
[00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.714]  They will accept this new beautiful, they call it beautiful transition.
[00:00:59.034 --> 00:01:00.775]  There is no transition but death.
[00:01:01.316 --> 00:01:03.097]  There is no transition but collapse.
[00:01:04.818 --> 00:01:09.142]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:16.021]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:34.021]  [Music]
[00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:34.860]  Info Wars.
[00:01:34.932 --> 00:01:36.932]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:01:36.932 --> 00:01:45.932]   I gotta tell you, this book, "The Great Reset and the War for the World,"
[00:01:45.932 --> 00:01:48.932]   the left and the mainstream media are going to have to sit there
[00:01:48.932 --> 00:01:52.932]  and we've got to force them to respond to this book.
[00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:55.345]  This book is that important.
[00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:57.286]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter.
[00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:11.291]   If you compare the finest, and I'm telling you, you take MIT Technology Review, you take Science, take all these magazines and journals, add the electronic part of it, and you know, NPR, PBS, all of it, I'll take it.
[00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:18.418]  I'll match up and we'll go through and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there.
[00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.743]  And if you're a sentient human being and just watching it, you say, well, God, Alex Jones was ahead of this.
[00:02:22.783 --> 00:02:23.984]  Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[00:02:24.064 --> 00:02:26.307]  They're just in this huge revolution.
[00:02:26.887 --> 00:02:33.686]   against choice and free will and normal technological development and adoption of technology that empowers
[00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:34.387]  humanity.
[00:02:34.387 --> 00:02:41.887]   Instead, they want adoption of technology, forced adoption, world IDs, global social credit scores, carbon taxes,
[00:02:41.887 --> 00:02:44.887]  that dominate and monitor every facet of our lives.
[00:02:44.887 --> 00:02:49.387]   You make the case of what the not just the new world order is,
[00:02:49.387 --> 00:02:55.887]   but using this great reset to really take up their whole idea of control and authoritarianism.
[00:02:56.137 --> 00:03:05.381]  They have decided to trigger a controlled collapse and then bring in a new dark age to control the general public where they will be in their Elysium fields.
[00:03:05.641 --> 00:03:07.902]  There is no new technology coming in.
[00:03:07.922 --> 00:03:08.762]  They're blocking that.
[00:03:09.342 --> 00:03:15.364]  And so really they're just imploding things under the cloud pivot model to show that they can get that control over us.
[00:03:15.744 --> 00:03:17.685]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter.
[00:03:17.745 --> 00:03:30.629]  He has presented tons of valid evidence and facts that I think have been really, really important to raising consciousness to what this sort of technocratic global elite really want to do.
[00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:40.094]   The true thing that you've done, which is stunning, If you look at the evidence of that and the facts, you are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:03:40.674 --> 00:03:41.575]  That is very rare.
[00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:45.238]  You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:52.724]  This book, The Great Reset and The War for the World, I'm telling you, everybody in America, the people that hate Alex Jones the most have to read this book.
[00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:54.246]  This is no beach read.
[00:03:54.926 --> 00:03:56.147]  You're not going to be flipping pages here.
[00:03:56.167 --> 00:03:58.669]  You're going to be having a pen out and you're going to be underlying stuff.
[00:03:58.769 --> 00:03:59.350]  It's amazing.
[00:04:01.638 --> 00:04:04.520]  The Great Reset and the War for the World by Alex Jones.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.323]  Available now at Amazon and Infowarsstore.com.
[00:04:08.603 --> 00:04:23.393]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[00:04:23.473 --> 00:04:32.517]   People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which By any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[00:04:32.336 --> 00:04:35.336]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[00:04:35.336 --> 00:04:38.336]  [laughter]
[00:04:38.336 --> 00:04:40.336]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[00:04:40.336 --> 00:04:43.336]  [laughter]
[00:04:43.336 --> 00:04:46.336]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[00:04:46.336 --> 00:04:48.336]  [laughter]
[00:04:48.336 --> 00:04:52.336]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[00:04:52.222 --> 00:04:54.562]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[00:04:54.582 --> 00:04:57.283]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.421]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:12.602]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[00:05:12.702 --> 00:05:17.663]  Chloride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:20.584]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[00:05:20.624 --> 00:05:24.804]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition.
[00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:27.885]  We're gonna have to work with dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[00:05:29.206 --> 00:05:33.148]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[00:05:33.228 --> 00:05:33.989]  Well, join me.
[00:05:34.549 --> 00:05:36.711]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:38.732]  There's a need for a new world order.
[00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:40.794]  Someday.
[00:05:41.735 --> 00:05:47.735]  In the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[00:05:47.735 --> 00:05:50.735]  [Music]
[00:05:51.735 --> 00:05:54.735]  [Music]
[00:05:54.735 --> 00:06:19.735]  [Music]
[00:06:19.735 --> 00:06:31.735]  [Music]
[00:06:32.008 --> 00:06:32.910]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:50.270]  today.
[00:06:50.512 --> 00:06:56.737]  Good afternoon everybody and welcome to the session on resetting digital currencies.
[00:06:57.258 --> 00:07:02.242]  The theme of this year's forum, as you know, is a crucial year to rebuild trust.
[00:07:02.903 --> 00:07:06.566]  The digital payment system can help reduce these logistical costs.
[00:07:06.746 --> 00:07:10.746]  can help remove the dangers of holding cash.
[00:07:10.746 --> 00:07:21.026]   As the architects of multiple global crises pour on the tyranny, the IMF is enjoying an elevated position as the problem solver
[00:07:21.026 --> 00:07:25.866]   most nations turn to for help, racketeering on a global scale.
[00:07:25.866 --> 00:07:34.246]   With all the current issues on our agenda, we tend to forget that we are in the midst of the fourth
[00:07:34.246 --> 00:07:40.626]   industrial revolution, which accelerates global change in much more comprehensive
[00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:44.865]   and faster ways than the previous three revolutions.
[00:07:44.946 --> 00:07:50.227]  The objective is to quickly recognize the potential of new technologies.
[00:07:50.587 --> 00:07:54.528]  History is truly at a turning point.
[00:07:55.108 --> 00:08:01.969]  We do not yet know the full extent and the systemic and structural changes which will happen.
[00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:12.626]  However, we do know that global energy systems, food systems, and supply chains will be deeply affected.
[00:08:13.347 --> 00:08:28.259]  And as Bloomberg gleefully reported, key Democratic congressional allies are urging President Joe Biden's administration to support a new injection of resources for countries at the IMF to help them deal with the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
[00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:40.207]  To the tune of at least $650 billion in additional IMF reserve assets, the demand is being led by Representative Pramila Jayapal and Senator Elizabeth Warren.
[00:08:40.447 --> 00:08:52.495]  Zero Hedge recently put the puzzle pieces together concerning the Democrats' proposed $650 billion flooding of the IMF with special drawing right funds.
[00:08:52.975 --> 00:08:55.477]  What are special drawing right funds?
[00:08:56.657 --> 00:09:05.559]  The Special Drawing Rights, or SDR, was created by the IMF in 1969 to supplement the official reserves of its member countries.
[00:09:06.899 --> 00:09:17.821]  The SDR is an interest-bearing international reserve asset that can only be held by the IMF, its member countries, and designated official entities known as prescribed holders.
[00:09:18.701 --> 00:09:23.142]  In addition to this role, the SDR serves as the unit of account of the IMF.
[00:09:26.223 --> 00:09:31.283]  Zero Hedge writes, each new crisis brings global banks closer to their goal.
[00:09:31.523 --> 00:09:40.385]  The introduction of national digital currencies and the SDR basket become the de facto reserve trading tool for the world.
[00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:45.646]  Why do Democrats specifically want aid denominated in SDRs?
[00:09:45.986 --> 00:09:50.867]  Because funding allocations in the US have already hit their maximum.
[00:09:51.187 --> 00:09:54.466]  and new funding bills are being defeated in the Senate.
[00:09:54.466 --> 00:09:57.985]  At the IMF, there are no checks and balances.
[00:09:57.985 --> 00:10:04.807]   They can ask for almost any amount of money in the form of SDRs without oversight.
[00:10:04.807 --> 00:10:10.546]   There are always strings attached when it comes to the IMF, and in exchange for SDRs,
[00:10:10.546 --> 00:10:15.066]  the globalists will certainly want more centralized control.
[00:10:15.066 --> 00:10:18.466]   The Ukrainian war is not merely a money laundering operation.
[00:10:18.466 --> 00:10:25.027]   It is a linchpin to transfer the global economy out of the money printing of central banks
[00:10:25.027 --> 00:10:29.346]   and directly into the hands of globalists controlling the IMF.
[00:10:29.346 --> 00:10:35.586]   We are being looted in real time of our property, currency, sovereignty, and our very lives.
[00:10:35.789 --> 00:10:42.789]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:10:42.789 --> 00:10:48.189]  Welcome my friends to this live Thursday, July 28th.
[00:10:48.201 --> 00:10:54.901]   8th 2022 transmission. I'm your host Alex Jones. I wanted to play that critical John
[00:10:54.901 --> 00:11:00.139]   Bowne report you can find and share at Band.Video and Infowars.com because that's the exact
[00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:05.420]   topic I was going to start the broadcast with today. The control design collapse and where
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.821]   we're at right now in their project and we have a very good chance of slowing it down
[00:11:09.821 --> 00:11:16.100]   and finally stopping it if we have a mass awakening and epiphany which is already starting
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.701]  to happen right now.
[00:11:17.702 --> 00:11:22.404]  So I am extremely, extremely excited about all of that.
[00:11:22.484 --> 00:11:25.645]  And we're going to be getting into a lot more of it today.
[00:11:25.745 --> 00:11:31.608]  So as bad as the situation is, we also have a lot of hope as well right now.
[00:11:32.928 --> 00:11:41.792]  But the level of brainwashing, the level of gaslighting that is going on is next level.
[00:11:42.352 --> 00:11:50.535]   Because you have to understand this Propaganda system we see, and these puppets we see, even Klaus Schwab, even Bill Gates are not the highest level.
[00:11:52.016 --> 00:11:59.802]  Though they're high-level generals in this, but there are millions of people like Biden, and Gavin Newsom, and Macron, and the rest of them.
[00:12:02.224 --> 00:12:07.547]  That's just their placeholder that, again, takes the blame for the global operation.
[00:12:08.683 --> 00:12:16.767]  And if we just blame the minions, we never blame the system that's written all the battle plans, the white papers, the operational systems, to carry out what we're living in.
[00:12:16.847 --> 00:12:42.486]   That's why I've been able to, with total precision, to predict exactly what's going to happen, because they're in control of most of the systems of the planet, and they're trying to get full control, and we are in a race to mobilize our states, our counties, our cities, our governments, our municipalities around the world, Our churches, our educational systems, to understand this societal collapse system that they call the Great Reset.
[00:12:43.086 --> 00:12:44.867]  And on our ashes, they're built back better.
[00:12:45.427 --> 00:12:47.427]  So everything else flows from that.
[00:12:48.208 --> 00:12:49.508]  That's the heart of the Hydra.
[00:12:50.308 --> 00:12:54.269]  And we can fight the heads of the Hydra all day long, as much as we want.
[00:12:54.389 --> 00:13:00.291]  But until we start addressing the heart of the matter, the New World Order, we don't have a hope in hell.
[00:13:02.211 --> 00:13:16.981]   The good news is, all over the world, From Pakistan, to Mexico, to Iraq, to Canada, to Germany, to Sri Lanka.
[00:13:17.041 --> 00:13:23.284]  Just hundreds and hundreds of uprisings against the globalists and people are talking about the Great Reset.
[00:13:23.784 --> 00:13:26.565]  They're talking about Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, India, you name it.
[00:13:26.925 --> 00:13:29.086]  They're talking about the New World Order.
[00:13:29.986 --> 00:13:31.527]  And so it's actually happening.
[00:13:31.867 --> 00:13:33.328]  Humanity is getting caught up.
[00:13:34.468 --> 00:13:36.088]  With what is actually being done to us.
[00:13:36.489 --> 00:13:38.069]  And that is our main mission here.
[00:13:39.369 --> 00:13:42.150]  Yes, we'll break down the symptoms of the disease.
[00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:46.111]  Yes, we'll break down what they're doing in real time to recognize their operations.
[00:13:46.131 --> 00:13:51.893]  But you have to understand, Klaus Schwab says we're going to cut the energy off and make you transition to a new system.
[00:13:52.233 --> 00:13:55.394]  And we're using COVID as the pretext to make the initial cut.
[00:13:55.954 --> 00:13:59.495]  And then after that, we're going to expand to climate lockdowns by cutting off the fuel.
[00:14:00.115 --> 00:14:01.055]  I'm on air 32 months ago.
[00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:09.279]  With total precision saying exactly what would happen in the next three years, and we're here.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.981]  Because we have the damn battle plan.
[00:14:12.641 --> 00:14:19.865]  And there is nothing more frustrating than sitting here trying to put out brush fires that are being started by the globalist dragon.
[00:14:20.446 --> 00:14:27.130]  You slay the dragon, or it'll continue to fly around burning down our civilization.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:32.403]  Speaking of that, we have more leftists being indicted for setting fires all over the United States.
[00:14:32.844 --> 00:14:48.140]   And they said, when they're arrested, all of them, same thing in Europe, same thing in Russia, same thing in Mexico, same thing in Chile, they say, we're doing this to bring down civilization and to cut off the food so that We can depopulate the earth and save it.
[00:14:48.901 --> 00:14:50.542]  Where are they getting the programming from?
[00:14:50.602 --> 00:14:51.804]  Where are they getting the directives from?
[00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:52.864]  Well, you see it in Hollywood.
[00:14:53.065 --> 00:14:53.905]  You see it in universities.
[00:14:54.125 --> 00:14:56.267]  You see it in primary education.
[00:14:56.307 --> 00:14:58.089]  You see it in the culture everywhere.
[00:14:58.429 --> 00:15:00.070]  And that's who these people are.
[00:15:00.091 --> 00:15:02.533]  Now, here's the big announcement.
[00:15:03.794 --> 00:15:06.276]  Everything the World Economic Forum says, they get.
[00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:10.991]  Because no one's been opposing them until now.
[00:15:11.351 --> 00:15:11.852]  Who are they?
[00:15:11.892 --> 00:15:14.014]  They're just the mouthpiece of the big global corporations.
[00:15:14.755 --> 00:15:20.662]  A month ago the UN Secretary General said we've signed a deal to coordinate and have the WEF basically tell us what to do.
[00:15:21.182 --> 00:15:28.451]  Last week they signed a further deal specifically saying they are in command of the healthcare policy and more of the UN.
[00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:45.145]  So first they have an international coup of the UN having power transferred to it, and then the corporations come right in, like musical chairs, and move themselves into the position openly to normalize the Fortune 100 and the private central banks that finance them out of nothing.
[00:15:46.206 --> 00:15:46.947]  It's just incredible.
[00:15:46.967 --> 00:15:48.929]  We are at such an amazing moment.
[00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:59.767]   I'm going to hit these articles, but the big announcement when we come back The WEF has charted our course of disaster, driven our Titanic right into the ice field, right into the icebergs.
[00:16:01.047 --> 00:16:03.108]  And now the next part of the phase is here.
[00:16:03.708 --> 00:16:07.269]  You think they're moving to ban beef is bad, or ban mother and father is bad.
[00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:09.549]  Wait till you hear their next move.
[00:16:09.569 --> 00:16:10.029]  Stay with us.
[00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:16.391]  I take the globalist attack on humanity personal, because I am human.
[00:16:18.211 --> 00:16:20.232]  I am a human supremacist.
[00:16:23.936 --> 00:16:25.077]  Not a black supremacist.
[00:16:25.898 --> 00:16:26.979]  Not a white supremacist.
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.041]  Not a brown supremacist.
[00:16:30.483 --> 00:16:31.924]  But a human supremacist.
[00:16:33.346 --> 00:16:34.107]  I'm pro-human.
[00:16:34.747 --> 00:16:38.091]  And I get chills thinking about who we are and how amazing we are.
[00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:41.975]  When we're focused and we're connected to God, we're unstoppable!
[00:16:44.217 --> 00:16:45.579]  And the New World Order knows that.
[00:16:47.014 --> 00:16:47.995]  They want to play God.
[00:16:48.575 --> 00:16:50.856]  They want to tell us to hate ourselves and have us fight with each other.
[00:16:51.556 --> 00:16:54.318]  They want to disease us and poison us and drug us and dumb us down.
[00:16:54.818 --> 00:16:56.619]  We're coming together and they can't stop us.
[00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:00.401]  Catch the spirit.
[00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:01.682]  Catch the drift.
[00:17:02.402 --> 00:17:05.204]  We are live broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday.
[00:17:07.005 --> 00:17:08.025]  Thursday transmission.
[00:17:08.085 --> 00:17:10.066]  So let me go ahead and make the big announcement.
[00:17:10.086 --> 00:17:11.167]  You know, you knew it was coming.
[00:17:12.714 --> 00:17:33.277]   If you watch my film, Endgame, made in 2007, or if you watch Obama Deception, made in 2009, if you watch those two films, which you can still find online, because there's thousands of copies, there's a few copies left here and there, They took down the ones on YouTube and stuff with 50 million, 20 million views.
[00:17:33.577 --> 00:17:35.699]  You can still find them 500,000 million views here.
[00:17:35.999 --> 00:17:37.640]  They slap that down, another one pops up.
[00:17:38.441 --> 00:17:39.422]  The Obama deception.
[00:17:39.902 --> 00:17:40.222]  Endgame.
[00:17:40.503 --> 00:17:44.886]  Why don't you get in a time machine and go back to the future?
[00:17:45.527 --> 00:17:57.277]  Because you go back to those films from 13 years ago, from 15, 16, 17 years ago, and then you're not going back, you're going forward.
[00:18:00.265 --> 00:18:03.047]  You're going back to the future.
[00:18:03.327 --> 00:18:04.728]  You're not getting tomorrow's news today.
[00:18:04.748 --> 00:18:06.970]  You're getting 20 years from now today.
[00:18:08.891 --> 00:18:10.132]  Because we know the enemy battle plan.
[00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:12.894]  And that's the secret they can't deal with.
[00:18:12.914 --> 00:18:17.798]  Because I knew our power was predicting the enemy's operations.
[00:18:17.998 --> 00:18:21.080]  Because I've seen stuff they launched in the 1850s come true by the 1920s.
[00:18:25.109 --> 00:18:29.792]  I saw the New World Order's 50-year, 100-year plans for my own self.
[00:18:31.873 --> 00:18:35.695]  They say the West plans for a year, the Chinese plan for 50 years.
[00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:40.057]  Folks, the New World Order plans in 100- and 200-year blocks.
[00:18:40.857 --> 00:18:45.020]  And when you start thinking like they do, it's game over for them.
[00:18:48.261 --> 00:18:53.454]   So just as much as I know tomorrow morning at 6.35 a.m.
[00:18:53.494 --> 00:18:55.015]  or whatever it is, Texas time.
[00:18:55.715 --> 00:18:56.355]  Central time.
[00:18:57.016 --> 00:18:58.116]  What time is sunrise tomorrow?
[00:18:58.136 --> 00:18:59.556]  Guys, look up sunrise.
[00:18:59.576 --> 00:19:00.757]  Just type in sunrise tomorrow.
[00:19:00.797 --> 00:19:01.437]  Google will tell you.
[00:19:03.438 --> 00:19:12.080]  I know that big old yellow ball, that controlled thermonuclear explosion is going to come rising back up.
[00:19:14.141 --> 00:19:17.522]  And I know just like that sun's going to come up tomorrow, that 6.45 a.m.
[00:19:17.542 --> 00:19:19.063]  is the time.
[00:19:21.738 --> 00:19:23.220]  So I know at 6.45 a.m.
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.704]  tomorrow, the sun's gonna crest the horizon.
[00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.574]  Just like I know they would implode our borders.
[00:19:34.178 --> 00:19:37.279]  Just like I knew they'd have pedophile drag queen story time.
[00:19:37.599 --> 00:19:39.359]  Just like I knew they'd devalue the currency.
[00:19:39.759 --> 00:19:41.940]  Just like I knew they'd launch wars with Russia.
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:48.062]  Just like I knew they would start banning beef and then farms, period.
[00:19:48.382 --> 00:19:49.962]  And people said, there's no way they'll ban beef.
[00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:51.903]  There's no way they'll force farmers off their land.
[00:19:52.183 --> 00:19:53.603]  There's no way they'll do it.
[00:19:53.723 --> 00:20:04.565]   And now, starting in the Pacific, in Australia and New Zealand, through Western Europe, Through all over North America.
[00:20:05.106 --> 00:20:22.860]  The IMF and World Bank are in control, and they're coming into the governments they control, and they're saying, you are going to shut down your farms, and put regulations on them so hard, unless they're big corporate farms, that the small and medium-sized farms and ranches can't operate, whether you're in California, or whether you're in the Netherlands.
[00:20:24.742 --> 00:20:28.745]  Whether you're in Chile, or Argentina, or whether you're in Nigeria.
[00:20:30.567 --> 00:20:30.907]  Everywhere.
[00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:34.374]  Except China.
[00:20:34.494 --> 00:20:36.038]  They're not putting regulations on their people.
[00:20:36.198 --> 00:20:36.800]  They're expanding.
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:37.442]  And Russia.
[00:20:39.206 --> 00:20:40.389]  But everywhere this is happening.
[00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:41.772]  So just like clockwork...
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.382]  Just like I know we're going to break in four minutes, exactly.
[00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:48.404]  They've got an atomic clock in here.
[00:20:49.144 --> 00:20:50.706]  I knew this was coming.
[00:20:50.986 --> 00:21:01.093]  So they've started, oh, this year we only ban 30% of your cows, next year 50, and within five years we'll ban 90% of your cows in the Netherlands, and then now they're announcing it all over the world.
[00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:03.375]  And who is announcing?
[00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:04.376]  Who's our boss?
[00:21:04.456 --> 00:21:05.397]  Who's our dictator?
[00:21:05.437 --> 00:21:06.277]  Who's in control?
[00:21:06.597 --> 00:21:09.700]  Drumroll please, we'll put the live show headline up on screen.
[00:21:11.929 --> 00:21:12.549]  It's all over.
[00:21:12.709 --> 00:21:15.691]  New York Times, Washington Post, it's so wonderful.
[00:21:18.412 --> 00:21:21.434]  WEF slash UN, they've now officially merged a month ago.
[00:21:21.494 --> 00:21:24.175]  They publicly merged.
[00:21:25.236 --> 00:21:28.418]  WEF-UN call for total, total.
[00:21:29.508 --> 00:21:30.068]  Total!
[00:21:30.728 --> 00:21:39.810]  World Economic Forum, Davos Group, and the UN call for TOTAL ban on private car ownership.
[00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:40.830]  Let me read that again.
[00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:49.292]  World Economic Forum, UN call for TOTAL ban on private car ownership.
[00:21:50.832 --> 00:21:54.193]  Launching next phase of great reset collapse.
[00:21:55.653 --> 00:22:01.972]   And when you read the articles in the press release by the WEF and the UN, They say it does not matter what governments do.
[00:22:02.432 --> 00:22:04.373]  We are cutting off the power.
[00:22:05.634 --> 00:22:10.576]  They will accept this new beautiful, beautiful, they call it beautiful transition.
[00:22:10.876 --> 00:22:12.637]  There is no transition but death.
[00:22:13.157 --> 00:22:14.958]  There is no transition but collapse.
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.020]  Think of the magnitude of that.
[00:22:21.361 --> 00:22:22.982]  Think of the reality of that.
[00:22:24.182 --> 00:22:25.283]  Think of where we are.
[00:22:28.353 --> 00:22:32.555]  They're destroying the social networks of humans.
[00:22:32.935 --> 00:22:35.096]  They're destroying the small businesses, the small farms.
[00:22:35.537 --> 00:22:37.478]  They are annihilating the social contract.
[00:22:38.238 --> 00:22:39.699]  And they're officially calling.
[00:22:40.099 --> 00:22:40.839]  Go read it for yourself.
[00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:45.162]  It's on Infowars.com or just type in W-E-F calls for end of private car ownership.
[00:22:45.462 --> 00:22:49.144]  Where there's all these bot cars, robot self-driving cars.
[00:22:50.373 --> 00:22:51.073]  That's coming next.
[00:22:51.313 --> 00:22:51.893]  They admit that.
[00:22:52.274 --> 00:22:54.274]  And then you've got to only use those.
[00:22:54.294 --> 00:23:03.577]  Because listen, you're not using that car you care about, you take care of, you love that's yours in the morning and at lunch and in the afternoon and when you go to the beach.
[00:23:04.497 --> 00:23:12.459]  You go to an allotment from a corporate company and a robot car pulls up and drives you where you're going.
[00:23:14.139 --> 00:23:16.000]  How are they going to make us adopt that?
[00:23:17.281 --> 00:23:25.307]  First shut down the regular infrastructure, then ration what you're able to get and make you stand in line to get a car.
[00:23:25.427 --> 00:23:28.990]  And see, because they built our infrastructure off the autobahn system that Hitler invented.
[00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:30.611]  Eisenhower copied that.
[00:23:32.392 --> 00:23:36.515]  And it built a really decentralized nation and made us almost impossible to invade.
[00:23:36.535 --> 00:23:38.797]  We've got so many roads and so much infrastructure.
[00:23:39.698 --> 00:23:44.962]  But if you cut the energy off, it makes you incredibly weak because you're isolated in all this urban sprawl.
[00:23:48.697 --> 00:24:02.706]  But if you can make people then use a car that works 20 hours a day that everybody else is in, you have no car ownership, no mobility, and now you're locked in that suburb.
[00:24:02.966 --> 00:24:04.347]  You're now locked on that farm.
[00:24:04.587 --> 00:24:09.710]  You're now locked in that community that's decentralized and the centralizers don't want that.
[00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:27.681]   They want to drive you in to the big mega cities where everywhere you go there's high-rises being built and 250 square foot coffin apartments built You say, they'll never make us do that, they'll never make us eat bugs, they'll never make us get an electric car, but they will by bureaucratic fiat and dictatorship.
[00:24:29.262 --> 00:24:42.250]  So, in the year 2022, the gauntlet was thrown down that they're going to take our cars and take our fossil fuels, they've already done almost all of it, and give us no replacement but collapse and death.
[00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:44.651]  This is how they're going to depopulate us.
[00:24:45.151 --> 00:24:45.512]  Stay with us.
[00:24:46.485 --> 00:24:53.686]  I'm going to go ahead in the next segment, not this segment, the next segment, open up to you about some real secrets.
[00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:56.567]  I don't just know all this stuff from the documents.
[00:24:56.587 --> 00:24:58.087]  I know 95% of it from that.
[00:24:58.947 --> 00:25:10.589]  But I, like so many other people, have been given, I guess what they would call divine inspiration or just those magic moments.
[00:25:10.949 --> 00:25:17.215]   And for over 30 years, I have Had recurring dreams.
[00:25:20.076 --> 00:25:30.060]  And I saw what was coming and literally had countless dreams, but also recurring dreams about what was going to be unfolding.
[00:25:32.141 --> 00:25:37.743]  And maybe I won't do it next segment, it's so heavy, but I'll try to give you the introduction to it.
[00:25:38.884 --> 00:25:42.365]  But I just did it earlier and it's human supremacy.
[00:25:45.267 --> 00:25:52.431]  And I like to show exhibits of anything I talk about, so maybe I won't explain human supremacy today, because it's such a big deal.
[00:25:53.031 --> 00:25:59.695]  But will you guys please print me the opening part of Genesis, where God gives us dominion over the earth?
[00:26:00.735 --> 00:26:04.898]  Whether you believe in that or not, you've got to decide whether you have dominion over yourself.
[00:26:06.223 --> 00:26:16.370]  And you've got to decide whether it's God that's going to have dominion over you, that you get orders from as an agent of God, or whether some other human that's jacked into the evil force is going to have dominion over you.
[00:26:18.051 --> 00:26:30.320]  But I realize that my 28 years on air, just during the last few breaks, has now come to the pinnacle of the most important information we're ever going to reveal here on air.
[00:26:33.137 --> 00:26:37.298]  And it's quite a download, but all the planets aligned, all the information just condensed.
[00:26:38.639 --> 00:26:44.981]  It was that galaxy brain moment that so many seek.
[00:26:46.862 --> 00:26:47.762]  But it's God's plan.
[00:26:49.583 --> 00:26:50.203]  And it really is.
[00:26:50.243 --> 00:26:52.463]  Do we want to have a human plan or a post-human plan?
[00:26:53.004 --> 00:26:59.586]  Noval Harari and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates say humans are obsolete, we're scum, because they know we are their competition.
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:06.569]  They know that if we go for what we want and what God wants to have, they can't compete with that transmission.
[00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:08.372]  They can't compete with that blueprint.
[00:27:08.592 --> 00:27:10.135]  They can't compete without architecture.
[00:27:11.036 --> 00:27:13.299]  They can't compete with that master plan.
[00:27:16.598 --> 00:27:17.579]  But I just see it now.
[00:27:18.059 --> 00:27:19.200]  It'll be so clear soon.
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.482]  Are you pro-human or are you anti-human?
[00:27:22.202 --> 00:27:25.125]  And of course, we wrote the book on are you pro-human or anti-human?
[00:27:25.405 --> 00:27:29.128]  Now it's being picked up by the intellectuals and the human resistance everywhere.
[00:27:29.388 --> 00:27:32.751]  But you are the human resistance to this alien takeover.
[00:27:33.932 --> 00:27:43.099]  And again, when I say alien takeover, I don't mean some little tinfoil flying saucer crashing in Roswell from Alpha Centauri or from Beetle Geese.
[00:27:47.941 --> 00:28:01.588]  I'm talking about the transmission in the universe of God's order and God's will, or do you choose to serve the agents of death?
[00:28:01.608 --> 00:28:24.975]   And I will tell you, we are the human supremacy movement, and damn Did I not have black people growing up in Dallas, Texas do horrible, mean, racist things to me?
[00:28:29.598 --> 00:28:34.921]  But also had black people take me in their house and cook me amazing dinners and literally pet me and tell me how much they loved me.
[00:28:38.563 --> 00:28:40.885]  And I had white people do horrible things to me.
[00:28:41.977 --> 00:28:42.417]  My life.
[00:28:43.177 --> 00:28:48.219]  But also had white people take me in their house and pet me and tell me how great I was.
[00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:52.720]  And I had Mexicans break my leg.
[00:28:54.921 --> 00:28:56.981]  But also had Mexicans do wonderful things for me.
[00:28:59.922 --> 00:29:00.782]  Because they're all people.
[00:29:02.363 --> 00:29:05.223]  And like Martin Luther King said, we're not going to judge them off what color they are.
[00:29:06.404 --> 00:29:10.845]  We're going to judge them off of the character of their actions and deeds.
[00:29:12.076 --> 00:29:14.017]  So I'm going to say it right now, real clear.
[00:29:15.398 --> 00:29:18.639]  I love everybody, no matter what color your beautiful skin is.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:32.305]  Whether you're a pink, polka-dotted, speckled creature like me, or whether you've got beautiful ebony skin, or you've got pure, beautiful white skin.
[00:29:32.325 --> 00:29:35.367]  The word I'm looking for is porcelain skin.
[00:29:36.889 --> 00:29:39.431]  What I care about is your heart and your guts and your mind.
[00:29:39.891 --> 00:29:41.712]  And you're under attack by these Satanists.
[00:29:41.893 --> 00:29:43.113]  And they want to kill you!
[00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:44.795]  And they want to kill your children!
[00:29:45.175 --> 00:29:47.476]  And I say we set our differences aside.
[00:29:48.777 --> 00:29:58.224]  And I say we come together and we beat these people and we smash their technocracy and we build the future together and we can do anything with our real diversity.
[00:29:59.905 --> 00:30:01.907]  These enemies tell us all day about diversity.
[00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:05.549]  They mean divided and conquered groups of people separate from each other.
[00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.766]   I want Unity.
[00:30:09.867 --> 00:30:12.708]  They claim they're gonna give us unity with their AI telling us what to do.
[00:30:13.348 --> 00:30:15.889]  That's a satanic unity and a counterfeit of God's unity.
[00:30:16.469 --> 00:30:25.412]  Our unity will come out of our individual actions based on love and justice and freedom and God's spirit coming together through the conflict that is about to unfold.
[00:30:27.973 --> 00:30:30.894]  So you've got my pledge to never surrender.
[00:30:32.694 --> 00:30:35.295]  You have my pledge to never back down to these demons and these satanists.
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:42.904]  You have my pledge to be 100% committed to you.
[00:30:45.225 --> 00:30:46.867]  Not because I'm some angel.
[00:30:48.107 --> 00:30:50.049]  Not because I want to save you.
[00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:57.454]  But because I'm following God's plan and I know we've got to save each other!
[00:30:57.474 --> 00:30:59.616]  I need you!
[00:31:00.376 --> 00:31:01.477]  You need me!
[00:31:02.017 --> 00:31:04.259]  We can't beat this without each other!
[00:31:07.864 --> 00:31:08.567]  We gotta do it!
[00:31:11.499 --> 00:31:12.744]  We can't let these monsters win.
[00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:27.157]  All over the world, from Africa to Latin America to Asia to North America to Europe, they're cutting off the power, they're cutting off the farms, they're cutting off the ranches, they're harassing our hardest working people, and they're turning us against each other.
[00:31:27.377 --> 00:31:27.977]  And you know what?
[00:31:28.158 --> 00:31:38.984]  When you get some group discriminates against you, and some group hurts you, and some group gangs up on you, you get pissed, and you look for a group to join, because that's a normal human attribute, because you're looking for a gang to protect you.
[00:31:40.585 --> 00:31:42.726]  But you've got to transcend that and join Christ's gang.
[00:31:44.315 --> 00:31:44.936]  God's gang.
[00:31:46.077 --> 00:31:51.462]  And realize that Jesus didn't take it on the other cheek because he was weak.
[00:31:52.282 --> 00:31:55.285]  But he was teaching us how to transcend their control.
[00:31:55.926 --> 00:31:57.147]  He wasn't backing down.
[00:31:57.207 --> 00:31:58.088]  He wasn't a loser.
[00:31:58.148 --> 00:31:59.229]  He was the winner.
[00:31:59.829 --> 00:32:07.396]  And he used his intellect, because he was the son of God, to counter them and to show them what real strength was.
[00:32:07.436 --> 00:32:09.839]  And he transcended death itself.
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.523]  We must transcend the racism they taught us.
[00:32:16.524 --> 00:32:26.572]  We must transcend all their garbage and realize they create the problem and then offer the solution as if they're the priest, as if they're the arbiters, as if they're the ones that can fix all this.
[00:32:26.812 --> 00:32:32.717]  When they're the ones that didn't create it all, they just greased the skids using our own weakness against us.
[00:32:33.718 --> 00:32:35.759]  And we have to blast past these people.
[00:32:38.101 --> 00:32:38.822]  We gotta come together.
[00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:58.660]  Under a code of freedom, and liberty, and justice, and coming together, and working together, and being strong, and that's what InfoWars is, and that's why the enemies of humanity hate us so much, because we love God, and God loves humanity!
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.543]  And I am a human supremacist!
[00:33:02.982 --> 00:33:14.482]  I am a human supremacist!
[00:33:14.482 --> 00:33:24.482]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:33:15.673 --> 00:33:19.356]  That term will be the future war with the robots and the AI.
[00:33:19.536 --> 00:33:24.100]  What you're hearing now is the entire future and everything they tried to stop us from doing.
[00:33:25.223 --> 00:33:27.704]  Our supremacy will not end with this planet!
[00:33:28.304 --> 00:33:30.044]  We will people the stars!
[00:33:30.224 --> 00:33:31.164]  We will colonize!
[00:33:31.344 --> 00:33:33.205]  We will green dead worlds!
[00:33:33.925 --> 00:33:35.265]  We will go interdimensional!
[00:33:35.465 --> 00:33:36.966]  We will unlock the secrets of the universe!
[00:33:37.246 --> 00:33:39.826]  God has laid them out like Christmas presents for his children!
[00:33:39.846 --> 00:33:52.529]  And I am extremely honored to be in the fulcrum and the heart of the fight to bring our race, the human race, in a race for the future!
[00:33:54.145 --> 00:33:55.286]  I am honored to be here!
[00:33:56.506 --> 00:34:07.791]  And we will break the enemy, we will break the pedophiles, we will break the Satanists, because God already sent His own self down here to show us He could do it!
[00:34:08.371 --> 00:34:12.113]  God would never ask us to go through an obstacle course He wouldn't go through!
[00:34:12.433 --> 00:34:19.276]  And now we're gonna go through what Christ did, and we're gonna go through it, and we're gonna be destroyed, but reborn on the other side!
[00:34:19.636 --> 00:34:20.296]  Stay with us!
[00:34:21.357 --> 00:34:22.137]  You live, you learn!
[00:34:25.353 --> 00:34:27.956]  Look, I said I'd hit it next segment, but I kind of hit it now.
[00:34:29.477 --> 00:34:44.332]  And God said, let us make man in our image, and after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and let them be fruitful and multiply.
[00:34:44.752 --> 00:34:46.054]  That's Genesis, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:48.075 --> 00:34:49.556]  And now what do we see happening?
[00:34:50.136 --> 00:34:50.937]  There's no men.
[00:34:50.957 --> 00:34:51.837]  There's no women.
[00:34:51.857 --> 00:34:53.558]  We're going to cut your energy off.
[00:34:53.878 --> 00:34:54.739]  Humans are bad.
[00:34:54.779 --> 00:34:55.840]  World government's good.
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:01.063]  The globalists are getting you to sabotage yourself and your life force so they can take over.
[00:35:01.603 --> 00:35:07.647]  They want a globalist, technocracy, post-human, apocalyptic supremacy.
[00:35:09.007 --> 00:35:16.572]  We have to come together for human values of justice and freedom and liberty, based on being human, not on what color we are, and defeat these people.
[00:35:19.259 --> 00:35:21.700]  WEF calls for end to private car ownership.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.381]  In fact, give me that Elon Musk tweet you gave me yesterday I didn't get to.
[00:35:25.262 --> 00:35:29.524]  He said we need a new cosmology, a new system of pro-human future and human expansion.
[00:35:29.564 --> 00:35:30.284]  My exact quote.
[00:35:30.904 --> 00:35:31.745]  That's not a new system.
[00:35:31.785 --> 00:35:33.185]  That's Genesis.
[00:35:34.786 --> 00:35:35.747]  That's what we just covered.
[00:35:35.767 --> 00:35:36.507]  That's not new.
[00:35:36.847 --> 00:35:37.848]  That's the prime directive.
[00:35:38.148 --> 00:35:39.088]  And I know he knows that.
[00:35:39.108 --> 00:35:44.231]  But he's telling you it's new because we've been inside the satanic anti-human order.
[00:35:44.491 --> 00:35:46.031]  He says, oh, the new thing.
[00:35:46.552 --> 00:35:46.992]  Genesis.
[00:35:48.609 --> 00:35:50.350]  Pretty big deal, what Elon Musk understands.
[00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:51.751]  Is he a double dealer?
[00:35:51.771 --> 00:35:52.372]  Can we trust him?
[00:35:52.452 --> 00:35:52.872]  I don't know.
[00:35:53.853 --> 00:35:55.894]  He says, a new philosophy of the future is needed.
[00:35:56.374 --> 00:35:58.796]  I believe it should be curiosity about the universe.
[00:35:59.316 --> 00:35:59.577]  Yes.
[00:36:00.617 --> 00:36:07.162]  Expanded humanity to become a multi-planet, an interstellar species to see what's out there.
[00:36:07.662 --> 00:36:08.342]  Perfectly said.
[00:36:09.203 --> 00:36:10.304]  I totally endorse that.
[00:36:10.904 --> 00:36:11.665]  And that's God's plan.
[00:36:13.715 --> 00:36:17.057]  They're cutting our energy off, they're attacking our fertility, they've lowered our sperm count by 9%.
[00:36:17.097 --> 00:36:20.958]  They're saying they're going to ban our cars and our cows, and they're doing it!
[00:36:23.239 --> 00:36:28.041]  They're bringing out their world government in all of its different phases.
[00:36:28.662 --> 00:36:33.864]  And then I've got all their incredible gaslighting that's taking place.
[00:36:35.585 --> 00:36:37.586]  You got Biden's, he's had four shots.
[00:36:39.329 --> 00:36:41.770]  Saying, oh, I got this new drug that's protecting me.
[00:36:42.071 --> 00:36:44.152]  And he goes on and says, COVID's here for good.
[00:36:47.114 --> 00:36:53.778]  But he promised you over and over and over again, if you just took the shot, you'd be protected.
[00:36:55.859 --> 00:37:01.382]  Here, let's go ahead and roll this clip of Biden today saying COVID's with us forever.
[00:37:01.703 --> 00:37:03.724]  And then you've got Burks.
[00:37:05.768 --> 00:37:08.512]  Saying, oh, we always knew it wouldn't work, but they didn't tell Trump that.
[00:37:09.073 --> 00:37:09.494]  Here it is.
[00:37:09.995 --> 00:37:11.677]  Let's keep investing in these tools.
[00:37:12.439 --> 00:37:19.349]  Vaccinations, treatments, tests, and more so we can help making them available to Americans, the American people, on a permanent basis.
[00:37:20.385 --> 00:37:23.966]  Let's get moving, and I say permanent basis, as long as they are needed.
[00:37:23.986 --> 00:37:34.269]  I want to get your take on a lot of people looking at the president now having this, and all these people who have been fully vaccinated and boosted and all that, and they're getting it.
[00:37:34.629 --> 00:37:40.810]  The 20% or so of Americans who have not been vaccinated might look at that doctor and say, why bother?
[00:37:41.371 --> 00:37:41.871]  Why bother?
[00:37:42.031 --> 00:37:42.571]  What do you tell them?
[00:37:44.246 --> 00:37:50.611]  Well, if you're across the South and you're in the middle of this wave, what's going to save you right now is Pax Lovid.
[00:37:50.892 --> 00:38:00.199]  But once we get through this wave, during the long, you should get vaccinated and boosted because we do believe it will protect you, particularly if you're over 70.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:21.895]   I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection and I think we overplayed the vaccines and it made people then So that's total doublespeak.
[00:38:21.935 --> 00:38:23.195]  It will protect you, but it won't.
[00:38:24.076 --> 00:38:25.317]  But we will save you.
[00:38:25.397 --> 00:38:27.278]  We've got something new for you.
[00:38:27.998 --> 00:38:32.682]  They rope you in, they destroy your immune system, and they say, but don't worry, we've got a new drug for you.
[00:38:34.663 --> 00:38:36.284]  Think about the criminal level of that.
[00:38:37.284 --> 00:38:42.567]  Now I want to move in now to inflation.
[00:38:42.727 --> 00:38:45.609]  Let's move into inflation.
[00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:57.336]  We have the Biden administration saying there is no inflation, and they've got their press secretary saying there's no inflation.
[00:38:59.137 --> 00:39:02.479]  But then when you look deeper into it, all there is is inflation.
[00:39:02.539 --> 00:39:04.440]  All there is is recession.
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.782]  In fact, this particular clip we've got is recession.
[00:39:08.049 --> 00:39:09.190]  We're beyond recession.
[00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:18.578]  We're in a totally mismanaged by design inflationary system that destroys small businesses and builds up the big central businesses.
[00:39:20.559 --> 00:39:30.688]  And we've got clip 9 of her saying that there is no consensus that a recession is the definition.
[00:39:30.928 --> 00:39:32.849]  Then we'll play the definition of recession after that.
[00:39:32.869 --> 00:39:33.170]  Here it is.
[00:39:33.848 --> 00:39:40.010]  If things are going so great, though, then why is it the White House officials are trying to redefine recession?
[00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:41.690]  No, we're not redefining recession.
[00:39:41.811 --> 00:39:51.313]  If we all understand a recession to be two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth in a row, and then you have White House officials come up here to say, no, no, no, that's not what a recession is.
[00:39:51.794 --> 00:39:52.934]  It's something else.
[00:39:53.074 --> 00:39:54.795]  How is that not redefining recession?
[00:39:54.815 --> 00:39:55.855]  Because that's not the definition.
[00:39:56.555 --> 00:39:57.555]  That is not the definition.
[00:39:57.555 --> 00:40:04.955]   Breitbart said in 2008, of course economists have a technical definition, which is of a
[00:40:04.955 --> 00:40:10.154]   recession, which is two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
[00:40:10.154 --> 00:40:11.154]  I can tell you this.
[00:40:11.154 --> 00:40:15.434]   And then yesterday he said two negative quarters of GDP growth is not the definition.
[00:40:15.218 --> 00:40:17.418]  the technical definition of recession?
[00:40:17.418 --> 00:40:18.097]  It is not.
[00:40:18.097 --> 00:40:18.698]  It is not.
[00:40:18.698 --> 00:40:19.418]  Why did he say that?
[00:40:19.418 --> 00:40:20.137]  It is not.
[00:40:20.137 --> 00:40:25.657]   I can speak to what he said yesterday in front of all of you,
[00:40:25.657 --> 00:40:27.977]  which is the last thing that you just repeated.
[00:40:27.977 --> 00:40:29.577]  There are many factors.
[00:40:29.577 --> 00:40:33.777]   There are many factors, economic factors and indicators to consider.
[00:40:33.777 --> 00:40:39.818]   And I will say that the textbook definition of recession is not,
[00:40:39.818 --> 00:40:42.458]  is not two negative quarters of GDP.
[00:40:42.458 --> 00:40:44.538]  (static)
[00:40:44.723 --> 00:40:47.567]  From the Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms.
[00:40:50.611 --> 00:40:51.611]  recession.
[00:40:51.611 --> 00:41:00.970]  And it is exactly what we just said.
[00:41:01.576 --> 00:41:12.059]  A downturn in economic activity defined by many economies as at least two consecutive quarters of decline in the country's gross domestic product.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.721]  It'd be like if they said to her, hey, you're wearing a red suit.
[00:41:19.821 --> 00:41:22.022]  She said, no, I'm wearing a black suit, or I'm wearing a green suit.
[00:41:22.042 --> 00:41:23.702]  We're like, no, you're wearing a red suit.
[00:41:24.203 --> 00:41:25.203]  She goes, you're colorblind.
[00:41:26.408 --> 00:41:29.911]  Like I said, I'm wearing a red sports jacket.
[00:41:30.331 --> 00:41:33.514]  Everybody watching knows you're wearing a navy blue sports jacket with a light blue shirt.
[00:41:34.355 --> 00:41:38.118]  You've got a salt and pepper beard and brown hair and blue eyes.
[00:41:38.538 --> 00:41:38.958]  I'm like, nope!
[00:41:39.779 --> 00:41:41.721]  I'm green and I've got a red beard.
[00:41:43.822 --> 00:41:47.345]  But again, they're just gaslighting you and training you to accept this fraud.
[00:41:47.365 --> 00:41:49.667]  Alright, Robert Barnes is coming up.
[00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:50.648]  I'll be coasting with him.
[00:41:50.728 --> 00:41:52.990]  Huge amounts of news, a bunch of giant topics.
[00:41:54.474 --> 00:41:55.015]  Next hour.
[00:41:55.095 --> 00:41:56.155]  But let me hit this right now.
[00:41:56.596 --> 00:41:57.036]  Look at this.
[00:41:57.717 --> 00:42:02.481]  Number one on the Amazon charts in history and over 15 other categories.
[00:42:02.521 --> 00:42:04.703]  Number 40 something in books in the world.
[00:42:05.363 --> 00:42:09.166]  I don't want to sit there and have the book sold on Amazon, but that's the number one chart in the world.
[00:42:09.506 --> 00:42:14.631]  If it goes to even the top 10, it'll make the book be 10 times bigger and it gives the whole enemy blueprint.
[00:42:15.211 --> 00:42:16.932]  So, go to InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:45:03.183 --> 00:45:11.769]  After being deleted by YouTube and social media in 2018, most people did nothing to defend Alex Jones or InfoWars.
[00:45:12.389 --> 00:45:19.494]  Instead, they obediently learned the new rules and rationalized their submission as a necessary evil.
[00:45:20.314 --> 00:45:27.159]  As a result, things have only gotten worse for everyone, and without any recourse, they are about to get much worse.
[00:45:28.079 --> 00:45:33.386]  Alex Jones is now patient zero for America's new de facto justice system.
[00:45:34.007 --> 00:45:38.032]  Brought to you by the fear, complacency, and inaction of the people.
[00:45:38.472 --> 00:45:42.377]  Because we take it, here's how we can all expect to now be treated.
[00:45:43.319 --> 00:45:59.521]  Even though Jones never mentioned their name and the parents never sought a retraction, Alex Jones is being sued for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress by parents of children who were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
[00:46:00.121 --> 00:46:13.124]  The rest of the plaintiffs are federal agents, and the legal team is comprised of highly politicized members of the anti-gun lobby, who have admitted their intention is to silence Alex Jones.
[00:46:13.904 --> 00:46:25.787]  So with this new precedent, if you dare question the official narrative, say for example, the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, then someone can sue you into oblivion for emotional distress.
[00:46:26.367 --> 00:46:27.387]  But it only gets worse.
[00:46:28.067 --> 00:46:36.757]  The plaintiffs claim that Alex Jones was the perpetrator of the Sandy Hook Crisis Actor Conspiracy Theory, which is demonstrably false.
[00:46:37.277 --> 00:46:49.611]  After all the censorship and deleted videos, one can still find hours and hours of video content compiled from hundreds of sources, all questioning the official narrative of Sandy Hook.
[00:46:50.471 --> 00:46:55.515]  It was arguably the most discussed conspiracy theory since 9-11.
[00:46:56.155 --> 00:47:01.699]  And over the course of seven years, Alex Jones spent less than 30 minutes discussing it.
[00:47:02.279 --> 00:47:05.221]  We know this because it's all part of the public record.
[00:47:05.582 --> 00:47:08.824]  But these radical judges do not care about evidence.
[00:47:09.104 --> 00:47:13.127]  I am not currently representing Alex Jones, so I am free to speak my mind.
[00:47:14.108 --> 00:47:21.253]  They're already, apparently I've heard, that the plaintiff's lawyers are complaining about me speaking out about the case.
[00:47:21.433 --> 00:47:24.015]  That's how corrupt these plaintiff's lawyers are.
[00:47:24.115 --> 00:47:31.101]  They're political hacks standing on the bodies of dead kids to line their pockets and take away other people's political rights.
[00:47:31.421 --> 00:47:33.423]  And I find it disgusting what they've done.
[00:47:34.303 --> 00:47:38.687]   And so, but in this particular context, Jones has produced more discovery than anybody.
[00:47:38.907 --> 00:47:42.710]  I can't find anyone that's produced more discovery than he is, and yet they pretended that he didn't.
[00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.391]  Why?
[00:47:44.051 --> 00:47:46.753]  Because they built their whole case on a big lie.
[00:47:47.114 --> 00:47:57.382]  Both Judge Gamble in Texas and Judge Bellis in Connecticut have found Alex Jones guilty without ever holding a trial or hearing any evidence.
[00:47:57.802 --> 00:48:04.671]  Which is worse treatment than anyone has ever gotten in America, including Charles Manson and Al Capone.
[00:48:05.252 --> 00:48:14.885]  And their excuse for this abomination of justice is they claim that Jones failed to provide them with the incriminating evidence that they imagine must exist.
[00:48:15.605 --> 00:48:23.191]  Whatever that mysterious, unspecified evidence is, both judges have stripped Jones of his First Amendment right.
[00:48:23.651 --> 00:48:26.093]  But Judge Gamble has gone much further.
[00:48:26.693 --> 00:48:34.279]  Judge Maya Gamble comes from CPS, who has been exposed for human trafficking and working with pedophiles.
[00:48:34.819 --> 00:48:46.183]  Gamble helped publish CPS propaganda praising the state's authority and advising parents that it's normal for their children to lie about being abused in foster care.
[00:48:46.943 --> 00:48:58.407]  In the Alex Jones case, Judge Gamble has ordered that the words First Amendment and free speech cannot be used by Alex Jones, his witnesses, or even his lawyers.
[00:48:59.127 --> 00:49:01.068]  He is not allowed to defend himself.
[00:49:01.788 --> 00:49:10.032]  Judge Gamble has instructed that the jury is not allowed to hear about the emotional trauma caused by the mass murderer who killed the children.
[00:49:10.712 --> 00:49:15.835]  They are only allowed to hear how their trauma was caused by the words of Alex Jones.
[00:49:16.715 --> 00:49:24.579]  And during jury selection, not a single juror thought the media has ever treated Alex Jones or InfoWars unfairly.
[00:49:25.499 --> 00:49:32.689]  And any juror who questioned the $100 million amount casually discussed by the plaintiff's lawyers were kicked off the jury.
[00:49:33.932 --> 00:49:41.795]  Alex Jones was cancelled from social media in 2018, and is now being cancelled from the US Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:49:42.595 --> 00:49:45.796]  And because of our complacency, everyone else is next.
[00:49:46.556 --> 00:49:53.038]  And in case you were wondering, the way we used to do justice was a thing called innocent until proven guilty.
[00:49:53.718 --> 00:49:57.240]  It relied upon the burden of proof, and it was pretty good.
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:01.061]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:50:02.352 --> 00:50:08.185]  Well, well-known pundit, constitutional lawyer, and one of the smartest guys I know when it comes to history, Robert Barnes, is with us today.
[00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:10.831]  I'm going to go back down to the show trial of the history.
[00:50:12.264 --> 00:50:15.945]  Well, the show trial of the century, definitely, but here in America, unprecedented.
[00:50:16.005 --> 00:50:20.026]  Even Mike Cernovich, who's a lawyer, said he looked at it and he's never seen anything like it in U.S.
[00:50:20.046 --> 00:50:20.466]  history.
[00:50:21.466 --> 00:50:22.686]  Robert Barnes is here with us.
[00:50:22.706 --> 00:50:29.168]  He's going to be getting into the huge FBI whistleblower information that came out about how they're trying to launch a war against the American people.
[00:50:29.188 --> 00:50:38.050]  We already knew that with the different information coming out about, oh, it's terrorists to go to your school board and, you know, criticize critical race theory or drag queen pedophile time.
[00:50:39.298 --> 00:50:43.079]  Robert's going to be covering all of that and so much more coming up.
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:48.902]  We're also going to be hitting on the UN, the WEF, saying ban private ownership of cars.
[00:50:48.922 --> 00:50:49.662]  That's now official.
[00:50:50.002 --> 00:50:51.022]  Not just ban the beef.
[00:50:51.743 --> 00:50:55.564]  We have Berks coming out and saying, yeah, the shot never worked.
[00:50:55.624 --> 00:50:59.526]  So what is Trump going to do about that now that his own advisors admit it was a fraud?
[00:50:59.546 --> 00:51:02.427]  He has to decouple from them now and say he was lied to.
[00:51:02.727 --> 00:51:04.207]  That's the only thing really hurting Trump.
[00:51:04.608 --> 00:51:06.388]  That's the big sin he's committed, in my view.
[00:51:06.408 --> 00:51:08.069]  We're going to be getting into all of that.
[00:51:09.482 --> 00:51:14.165]  But Barnes, first off, you've been watching this trial that kicked off Monday.
[00:51:14.185 --> 00:51:14.926]  They call it a trial.
[00:51:15.546 --> 00:51:16.907]  They're trying to hide from the media.
[00:51:16.927 --> 00:51:17.808]  The media works with them.
[00:51:18.248 --> 00:51:22.271]  They're trying to hide from the jurors that a judge found me guilty, not a jury of my peers.
[00:51:22.291 --> 00:51:23.411]  She calls it a special case.
[00:51:23.431 --> 00:51:30.816]  She's been trying to block anything coming in, even stuff that was put in to Discovery years ago, things that was put in weeks ago as evidence.
[00:51:31.137 --> 00:51:37.361]  She's now playing dumb and saying we can't put in clips where I said Sandy Hook happened nine, ten years ago.
[00:51:38.686 --> 00:51:39.687]  So they can misrepresent.
[00:51:39.707 --> 00:51:41.527]  I have a right to say it didn't happen, if I believe that.
[00:51:41.567 --> 00:51:44.549]  But it shows we were putting out a lot of different ideas and views.
[00:51:45.089 --> 00:51:46.750]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:47.470]  No doubt.
[00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:51.152]  I mean, it's a complete joke of justice in Texas and in America.
[00:51:51.452 --> 00:51:54.434]  Because what's happened, you've already had a complete denial of due process of law.
[00:51:54.454 --> 00:51:56.095]  Your right to bring motions to dismiss.
[00:51:56.175 --> 00:51:58.676]  Your right to bring motions for summary judgment.
[00:51:58.696 --> 00:51:59.957]  Your right to bring slap motions.
[00:51:59.976 --> 00:52:03.855]   your right to bring appeals of those motions and any denial thereof.
[00:52:03.855 --> 00:52:07.976]   Then you've been denied the right to trial by jury on the substantive merits of the case.
[00:52:07.976 --> 00:52:12.056]   And now you're being systematically denied your right to present any evidence concerning
[00:52:12.056 --> 00:52:16.815]   your own case about the very limited issues she's allowing the jury hear.
[00:52:16.815 --> 00:52:20.695]   While she's allowing the jury to hear a bunch of inflammatory evidence that has nothing
[00:52:20.695 --> 00:52:23.936]   at all to do with the case because the judge has said we're only here for damages.
[00:52:23.936 --> 00:52:27.976]   Well, if we're only here for damages, then 90% of the evidence that's come in shouldn't
[00:52:27.976 --> 00:52:29.576]  have come in on behalf of the plaintiffs.
[00:52:29.705 --> 00:52:34.408]  But to the degree she's going to allow that evidence, there's something called the Rule of Completeness.
[00:52:34.488 --> 00:52:35.289]  What does that mean?
[00:52:35.369 --> 00:52:38.371]  For those folks out there, there's Rule 106 in the Federal Rules of Evidence.
[00:52:38.951 --> 00:52:40.332]  I use it a lot in the Snipes case.
[00:52:40.673 --> 00:52:51.040]  It means you can't take one excerpt out of a statement, out of a letter, out of a comment, out of an article, out of a broadcast, and exclude the context in which that comment is made.
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:53:00.044]   And here, their entire premise of the case Is that Alex Jones is solely and wholly responsible for all the pain ever suffered by anybody connected to Sandy Hook.
[00:53:00.444 --> 00:53:02.745]  The exculpatory evidence proves that's utterly false.
[00:53:02.885 --> 00:53:03.585]  Completely false.
[00:53:04.046 --> 00:53:07.247]  Proves that Infowars and Alex Jones covered every aspect of this case.
[00:53:07.287 --> 00:53:10.748]  That 99.9% of what they covered said Sandy Hook happened.
[00:53:11.148 --> 00:53:19.731]  And in fact there isn't evidence that the individual suffered injury from these words as is revealed in the fact they never sought retractions, corrections or apologies at the time.
[00:53:20.051 --> 00:53:22.132]  But you apologized even before that!
[00:53:22.492 --> 00:53:24.936]  And yet here, they're not allowing any of that evidence in.
[00:53:25.117 --> 00:53:25.437]  Why?
[00:53:25.517 --> 00:53:32.088]  Why is the... The judge ruled, as you know, two days ago, when you read a news article, Alex Jones apologized before they sued me.
[00:53:32.569 --> 00:53:33.691]  She goes, that is stricken.
[00:53:35.063 --> 00:53:35.944]  He's not allowed to say that.
[00:53:35.984 --> 00:53:36.444]  To the jury.
[00:53:36.604 --> 00:53:36.864]  Exactly.
[00:53:36.884 --> 00:53:43.469]  The jury's not allowed to know that you said that Sandy Hook happened and that most of Infowars said that over and over and over again over a seven year time period.
[00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:47.671]  They're not allowed to know that the real reason they're suing is simply asking questions.
[00:53:47.731 --> 00:53:52.355]  That's most of their legal theory of their lawsuit if you go back and listen to the deposition.
[00:53:52.395 --> 00:53:54.536]  And the Democrats admit this is a blueprint to ban everybody.
[00:53:54.716 --> 00:54:05.206]  Yes, exactly like Alex Berenson came out and attacked anybody who was defending you yesterday because he misunderstands and misapprehends the fact he didn't exercise his core duties of due diligence as a journalist.
[00:54:05.606 --> 00:54:10.271]  Because if you knew the facts, the actual theory of this case is to create a legal safe space.
[00:54:10.791 --> 00:54:23.540]  That if somebody challenges the government narrative on any major event, that there's somebody within a zone of emotional danger is offended by you disagreeing with the government narrative, they can now sue you into oblivion.
[00:54:23.901 --> 00:54:34.388]  If Alex Berenson had paid attention to the legal theory the plaintiffs are trying to use this case to establish precedent, they know they could sue him into oblivion because of what he has said dissident information about.
[00:54:34.408 --> 00:54:36.210]  So the press is getting rid of its own protections?
[00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:37.110]  Completely!
[00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:41.814]  I mean, what they're banking on is that this will only be used to target so-called heretics.
[00:54:41.894 --> 00:54:44.236]  I call it the return of the heresy trials in America.
[00:54:44.636 --> 00:54:51.281]  That this is an effort, and they assume that it will be gatekeeped in such a way that the Institute... Let me look at the Covington case.
[00:54:51.641 --> 00:55:04.351]  The judge dismissed a bunch of Nicholas Sandman's cases yesterday against a bunch of media outlets on the grounds that it wasn't a specifically enough statement made about a specifically identified individual under the constitutional colloquium requirement.
[00:55:04.451 --> 00:55:05.731]  And I never said these people's names.
[00:55:06.051 --> 00:55:06.372]  Exactly.
[00:55:06.412 --> 00:55:07.612]  They said Sandman's name.
[00:55:07.912 --> 00:55:08.532]  Correct.
[00:55:08.752 --> 00:55:09.433]  They said his name.
[00:55:09.473 --> 00:55:10.713]  They identified him by image.
[00:55:10.753 --> 00:55:11.633]  Where he went to school.
[00:55:11.933 --> 00:55:12.293]  Exactly.
[00:55:12.353 --> 00:55:13.874]  I never said any of their names.
[00:55:14.354 --> 00:55:14.754]  Exactly.
[00:55:14.794 --> 00:55:17.435]  And they go, Mr. Jones for 10 years stalked these people.
[00:55:17.795 --> 00:55:19.796]  We have videos the first four years he thought it happened.
[00:55:19.836 --> 00:55:20.656]  Later he questioned it.
[00:55:20.696 --> 00:55:21.616]  Later he said he thought it happened.
[00:55:21.956 --> 00:55:22.737]  We're not allowing that in.
[00:55:23.037 --> 00:55:23.377]  Exactly.
[00:55:23.417 --> 00:55:25.577]  They don't want the context to be presented.
[00:55:25.597 --> 00:55:27.258]  They want a caricature of Alex Jones.
[00:55:27.278 --> 00:55:33.700]  It'd be like if Martin Luther King was writing a letter, which he did, and then he quoted what a KKK leader said.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.761]  And then they went, look, Martin Luther King's pro KKK.
[00:55:36.781 --> 00:55:38.801]  And Martin Luther King's like, no, read the whole letter.
[00:55:39.102 --> 00:55:39.542]  Completely.
[00:55:39.742 --> 00:55:41.062]  It's why the rule of completeness exists.
[00:55:41.082 --> 00:55:46.724]  The rule of completeness exists to prevent the jury from coming to an incorrect conclusion about what was actually said.
[00:55:46.744 --> 00:55:48.485]  So why is the judge doing this?
[00:55:48.545 --> 00:55:51.506]  Because under Texas code, they were showing, they said it was over.
[00:55:51.526 --> 00:55:53.827]  In his opening statements, he said, he's guilty.
[00:55:54.127 --> 00:55:55.407]  He owes $150 million.
[00:55:55.767 --> 00:55:56.507]  He did this.
[00:55:56.608 --> 00:55:58.788]  And they said he totally violated state law.
[00:55:59.048 --> 00:56:00.249]  They said it's over on appeal.
[00:56:00.289 --> 00:56:00.709]  But who knows?
[00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:04.113]  I mean, what she said about defamation law was a lie.
[00:56:04.133 --> 00:56:05.274]  I mean, it was a flat-out lie.
[00:56:05.554 --> 00:56:07.016]  Libel law in Texas is very clear.
[00:56:07.076 --> 00:56:10.100]  You can use an apology as a right to mitigate damages.
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:12.042]  By the way, this is common law throughout the country.
[00:56:12.383 --> 00:56:12.743]  Why?
[00:56:13.124 --> 00:56:17.409]  Because we want to encourage and incentivize people to give apologies... Plus!
[00:56:18.655 --> 00:56:19.355]  It gets even worse.
[00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:20.416]  They never sent a retraction.
[00:56:20.816 --> 00:56:21.016]  Correct.
[00:56:21.056 --> 00:56:23.537]  I mean, they never requested a retraction, never requested a correction.
[00:56:23.757 --> 00:56:25.478]  They never did so until the very eve of suit.
[00:56:25.798 --> 00:56:28.219]  And he or she's denying the jury hearing all the facts.
[00:56:28.579 --> 00:56:36.782]  So they want the plaintiff's lawyers' made-up, fictional, fabricated version of events to be the only set of events they hear.
[00:56:37.002 --> 00:56:38.763]  It's basically completely gagging the defense.
[00:56:39.043 --> 00:56:40.824]  You can hear the plaintiff's side, you can't hear the defense.
[00:56:40.844 --> 00:56:41.324]  And it gets worse.
[00:56:41.684 --> 00:56:42.664]  I don't even really chew gum.
[00:56:42.724 --> 00:56:43.865]  I might have a stick of gum once.
[00:56:44.605 --> 00:56:44.926]  A month.
[00:56:44.966 --> 00:56:45.466]  I should do it more.
[00:56:45.486 --> 00:56:46.207]  It's good for your teeth.
[00:56:47.228 --> 00:56:48.850]  If it's a low sugar one or whatever.
[00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:51.553]  I'm just sitting there this morning totally not even paying attention.
[00:56:52.454 --> 00:56:53.475]  She goes, are you chewing gum?
[00:56:54.676 --> 00:56:55.217]  Are you chewing gum?
[00:56:56.337 --> 00:56:57.258]  Just to get that in the news.
[00:56:57.538 --> 00:56:57.718]  Right.
[00:56:58.239 --> 00:56:58.900]  I mean, that's insane.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:03.164]  I mean, this is a liberal authoritarian judge who has no business being on the court.
[00:57:03.204 --> 00:57:04.325]  She lied to get elected.
[00:57:04.345 --> 00:57:09.390]  I mean, she told people she would treat everybody fairly, give everybody a full hearing in her courtroom.
[00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:09.991]  She lied.
[00:57:10.111 --> 00:57:11.092]  She lied to get elected.
[00:57:11.753 --> 00:57:15.016]  It's not a big surprise, but you see her authoritarian tendencies in the courtroom.
[00:57:15.356 --> 00:57:21.839]  Judges with her temperament are precisely the kind of people who should never be judges in America, and people are getting to witness it in live time.
[00:57:22.139 --> 00:57:27.661]  But she's so scared of what people will witness that she's exclusively monopolizing who can publish and broadcast it.
[00:57:27.861 --> 00:57:28.301]  Well, that's right.
[00:57:28.321 --> 00:57:30.262]  They couldn't give me a trial, so they said I was guilty.
[00:57:30.542 --> 00:57:34.444]  Now they're trying to rig the damages portion.
[00:57:34.864 --> 00:57:37.287]  Absolutely, and she doesn't want the world to see what she's up to.
[00:57:37.647 --> 00:57:41.352]  So you're not allowed to... She keeps saying to the jury, this is a very special case, he's guilty.
[00:57:41.832 --> 00:57:48.420]  The jury, we learned, we have the videos, and the jury voir dire, most of the people are asking, well I thought I get to choose if he's guilty.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:49.381]  Exactly.
[00:57:49.701 --> 00:57:50.302]  That's America.
[00:57:50.362 --> 00:57:51.343]  Right to trial by jury.
[00:57:51.383 --> 00:57:52.785]  Established back in the Magna Carta.
[00:57:53.025 --> 00:57:54.147]  That was the whole point and principle.
[00:57:54.167 --> 00:57:57.331]  That's an eight century old principle in American and Anglo-Saxon law.
[00:57:57.351 --> 00:57:59.854]  And we know the Democrats have been pushing to get rid of jury trials.
[00:57:59.894 --> 00:58:02.457]  That's been a big push of the American Bar Association.
[00:58:02.958 --> 00:58:03.759]  And now this is it.
[00:58:03.919 --> 00:58:04.960]  Alex Jones is the test case.
[00:58:05.301 --> 00:58:07.724]  If you can take a jury trial from Alex Jones, everybody else follows.
[00:58:07.904 --> 00:58:11.905]  Exactly, like some people get confused when they say, oh, it's a default judgment and exception to right to trial by jury.
[00:58:11.925 --> 00:58:12.785]  Well, you didn't show up.
[00:58:12.805 --> 00:58:13.165]  That's not true.
[00:58:13.225 --> 00:58:14.205]  Yeah, it's not true at all.
[00:58:14.246 --> 00:58:23.048]  No, in fact, the reason why default judgments are generally not allowed in America is because of the right to trial by jury, not by judge.
[00:58:23.508 --> 00:58:29.929]  And this judge is someone who, if she had confidence in what she was doing, she'd let anybody clip or rebroadcast her, the court proceedings.
[00:58:29.969 --> 00:58:30.309]  She's not.
[00:58:30.329 --> 00:58:30.669]  That's it.
[00:58:30.709 --> 00:58:33.210]  She said, I may, today she said, I may just end the live broadcast.
[00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:38.753]  Then that wouldn't surprise me at all, because she's terrified at the fact that the- We talked on the phone last night for 10 minutes.
[00:58:40.073 --> 00:58:41.714]  You predicted she'd probably cut the feed.
[00:58:41.734 --> 00:58:42.635]  She said she made it out.
[00:58:42.795 --> 00:58:45.556]  Oh, absolutely, because she was already deleting videos.
[00:58:45.596 --> 00:58:47.717]  Like, I had lawyers who wanted to follow the case.
[00:58:47.997 --> 00:58:50.358]  Viva Frye was wanting to figure out where it was.
[00:58:50.499 --> 00:58:52.600]  And all of a sudden, the videos of the trial were disappearing.
[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:54.681]  And I'm going to leave, and you're going to take over now.
[00:58:54.901 --> 00:58:57.422]  We'll do one more segment, but I don't want to just harp on me all day.
[00:58:57.442 --> 00:58:58.503]  We've got a lot of other news to cover.
[00:58:59.443 --> 00:59:02.586]  You predicted it in our little, I looked at my phone, I hung up, it was like an 11 minute conversation.
[00:59:03.246 --> 00:59:05.308]  I'm like, wow, Barnes says she'll probably cut the feed.
[00:59:05.328 --> 00:59:06.529]  She said, I may just cut the feed.
[00:59:07.029 --> 00:59:12.674]  Imagine, she wants one feed so she can say what she wants, but then doesn't want it because she doesn't want people looking at what she's done.
[00:59:13.074 --> 00:59:13.395]  Exactly.
[00:59:13.435 --> 00:59:16.117]  She doesn't want, there's a public right to access the trials.
[00:59:16.397 --> 00:59:18.799]  In the old days, our trials were publicly held proceedings.
[00:59:19.059 --> 00:59:23.943]  She doesn't want the public to see what she's up to because it's such a travesty and tragedy of justice.
[00:59:24.224 --> 00:59:25.164]  But she did it first!
[00:59:26.266 --> 00:59:27.667]  Now she's going, whoa, what did I do?
[00:59:27.687 --> 00:59:36.653]  We're going to come in for a break and play a clip of last night when the trial was ending for the night where my lawyer, Andino Reynal, and the other lawyer got in a little bit of a fracas.
[00:59:36.673 --> 00:59:39.315]  We'll tell you why it happened after we play the clip on the other side.
[00:59:40.788 --> 00:59:56.303]  Okay, so Robert Barnes is going to hit world news, the economy, inflation, these giant FBI developments, Trump threatening to sue CNN, or says he is suing CNN, then admitting the head of the COVID response that it was all a fraud, didn't work, just incredible stuff coming up with Robert Barnes today.
[00:59:56.724 --> 01:00:07.167]   I'll go back down to the show trial of the century, but they have done stuff like put up a meme That was on the show once.
[01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:09.348]  We just flashed stuff up constantly of Beetlejuice.
[01:00:10.129 --> 01:00:13.030]  I've been on the Howard Stern Show many times before he turned against me.
[01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:15.671]  And I've been on the show with Beetlejuice.
[01:00:16.351 --> 01:00:17.892]  Well, Beetlejuice is a funny comedian.
[01:00:17.932 --> 01:00:22.634]  So they put a picture up that we put up of Beetlejuice that said, look, why does Alex hate black people?
[01:00:23.014 --> 01:00:25.315]  So we're not allowed to bring any of our evidence in.
[01:00:25.615 --> 01:00:26.856]  What does this have to do with the trial?
[01:00:28.397 --> 01:00:34.061]  That Beetlejuice, but that's the kind of stuff that went on yesterday, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:34.081 --> 01:00:41.687]  But imagine, they agree, and they have the emails and everything, and the judge agreed to the videos that Banksy was going to play, we could play.
[01:00:42.507 --> 01:00:48.812]  But the judge ruled that most of the videos that he plays only pieces of, we can't play the whole thing.
[01:00:50.563 --> 01:00:52.285]  And her excuse was, I haven't been able to watch them all.
[01:00:52.865 --> 01:00:54.607]  Anybody that knows the law knows that's pure fraud.
[01:00:54.627 --> 01:00:55.748]  I'm not even a lawyer and I know that.
[01:00:56.349 --> 01:01:05.818]  But here's about 5.30 last night, after the jury had left, and my main lawyer, Andino, right now, is saying, okay, well, here's the videos we're going to play tomorrow.
[01:01:05.918 --> 01:01:06.539]  It was his turn.
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.501]  And they said, we didn't agree to that.
[01:01:08.681 --> 01:01:09.682]  And he gets a little bit angry.
[01:01:09.702 --> 01:01:10.223]  Here's the video.
[01:01:11.032 --> 01:01:11.593]  Right here, man.
[01:01:11.873 --> 01:01:12.233]  My space.
[01:01:12.313 --> 01:01:13.234]  I came up to talk to you.
[01:01:13.595 --> 01:01:14.256]  Will you talk to me?
[01:01:14.996 --> 01:01:15.957]  Anita, will you talk to me?
[01:01:15.997 --> 01:01:16.678]  Will you talk to me?
[01:01:16.698 --> 01:01:17.719]  I was in the middle of the hallway.
[01:01:17.739 --> 01:01:19.101]  Will you talk to me?
[01:01:19.161 --> 01:01:22.545]  In the middle of the hallway, you said to me, are all your videos on this?
[01:01:22.585 --> 01:01:26.289]  I said this is a summary exhibit and we're agreeing to all this.
[01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:27.630]  Hey guys, maybe now's not the time.
[01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:29.993]  Maybe we can cool off and you and I can have a phone call later.
[01:01:30.613 --> 01:01:32.474]  Yeah, sounds like a good idea.
[01:01:32.574 --> 01:01:36.216]  Anything you're going to say to me, I'm just going to say it.
[01:01:36.236 --> 01:01:39.878]  That way you can go ahead and then we're not going to have a fight.
[01:01:39.918 --> 01:01:42.179]  Mark, do you have his phone number?
[01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:42.700]  I don't have it.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:43.780]  We're having a fight right now.
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:45.441]  Write your phone number down so we can get it.
[01:01:45.461 --> 01:01:49.743]  We'll call you after the plate cools down a little bit on both sides.
[01:01:49.763 --> 01:01:51.224]  I don't have it.
[01:01:51.264 --> 01:01:53.145]  Not exactly, which is why I'm trying to get you to open it.
[01:01:53.165 --> 01:01:54.786]  No, you can give me your phone number, Federico.
[01:01:54.806 --> 01:01:56.547]  I don't want to talk to you anymore right now.
[01:01:56.787 --> 01:01:57.608]  Give me your phone number.
[01:01:57.648 --> 01:01:59.189]  Write it down and we can give it a call.
[01:01:59.229 --> 01:01:59.869]  I'll text it to you.
[01:02:01.345 --> 01:02:05.589]  You have my phone number?
[01:02:05.689 --> 01:02:10.273]  I'll email it to you.
[01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:17.600]  So he gets mad because right before that, they're telling the judge, no, none of this is admissible, we didn't agree, even though the judge had already agreed.
[01:02:17.881 --> 01:02:19.682]  The level of this, they don't want us to have anything.
[01:02:20.263 --> 01:02:22.285]  We had one exhibit, they said none of that.
[01:02:22.879 --> 01:02:23.180]  Exactly.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:26.643]  I mean, it's a complete mockery at every level of any aspect of an impartial trial.
[01:02:26.683 --> 01:02:29.465]  I mean, again, even show trials tried to make a show of it.
[01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:33.429]  These show trials are a complete mockery and a complete embarrassment to the rule of law.
[01:02:33.449 --> 01:02:36.532]  To give an example, one, the parties agree to something before trial.
[01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:40.155]  They do that so that they don't have to worry about evidentiary objections during trial.
[01:02:40.456 --> 01:02:43.218]  That appeared to have been done here, but... No, he had the emails.
[01:02:43.238 --> 01:02:43.919]  He produced them today.
[01:02:44.119 --> 01:02:44.640]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.082]  Unsurprisingly, the plaintiff's lawyer lied.
[01:02:47.122 --> 01:02:49.645]  In my experience, he's a hopeless, profligate liar.
[01:02:50.346 --> 01:02:51.988]  Utterly unreliable, a mental freak.
[01:02:52.508 --> 01:02:57.774]  I mean, the way he got to law school was that he had a free ticket to the Nuthouse and the Uber driver dropped him off at the wrong place.
[01:02:58.154 --> 01:03:00.777]  So that's who he is, and so it's unsurprising.
[01:03:01.858 --> 01:03:11.287]  Still shocking to some degree is a court being complicit in this process, being so one-sided, being so partial, being so prejudicial as to not allow any of the merits.
[01:03:11.587 --> 01:03:21.597]  And again, if the Alex Berenson's of the world and the rest of them were right about this case, why is the plaintiff's lawyers, why is the court so scared for the jury to hear all the evidence?
[01:03:21.657 --> 01:03:22.518]  And let's expand on that.
[01:03:23.379 --> 01:03:28.643]  My lawyers and a bunch of lawyers I've talked to have never seen someone not call, the plaintiffs call the person they're suing.
[01:03:29.043 --> 01:03:29.964]  They've not called me.
[01:03:29.984 --> 01:03:30.744]  They've not subpoenaed me.
[01:03:30.784 --> 01:03:32.786]  Obviously, I'll testify on my side next week.
[01:03:33.626 --> 01:03:34.367]  What are they scared of?
[01:03:34.947 --> 01:03:35.347]  Exactly.
[01:03:35.508 --> 01:03:38.750]  I mean, you would think, I mean, you're supposed to be the living great Satan.
[01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:41.992]  You're supposed to be the devil, the demon in actual public presence.
[01:03:42.292 --> 01:03:45.695]  You would, in almost every case like this, you would be eager.
[01:03:46.175 --> 01:03:47.596]  To put the defendant on the stand.
[01:03:47.616 --> 01:03:49.177]  But they know that they've told a lie.
[01:03:49.197 --> 01:03:54.760]  It's not Alex Jones that's on trial, it's the caricature, the media caricature of Alex Jones that's on trial.
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:04:02.305]  And in order to sustain that illusion, they need to have only evidence that supports their caricatured version of Alex Jones.
[01:04:02.345 --> 01:04:09.689]  Because the real Alex Jones, the real evidence, the real live-time videos, the real live-time documents, disprove their theory of the case.
[01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:13.071]  It's the whole reason why the court and the plaintiffs begged for a default in the first place.
[01:04:13.371 --> 01:04:19.136]  Because the evidence they claimed exists just doesn't exist because their theory of the whole case was always wrong.
[01:04:19.156 --> 01:04:23.560]  That's how it started in Connecticut first with a sanction was they said give us your Sandy Hook.
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:24.781]  Marketing.
[01:04:24.801 --> 01:04:25.622]  We hardly ever covered it.
[01:04:25.642 --> 01:04:27.183]  We don't have like a news article.
[01:04:27.203 --> 01:04:28.424]  We don't have marketing with an article.
[01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:31.567]  If I cover monkey pox, there's not like a meeting about marketing with it.
[01:04:32.167 --> 01:04:33.148]  News is one thing.
[01:04:33.609 --> 01:04:35.711]  Products that we think are popular work well are another.
[01:04:36.371 --> 01:04:40.513]  But the judge said, no, I'm sanctioning you, you have it.
[01:04:41.034 --> 01:04:42.555]  And then that started the whole thing going.
[01:04:42.855 --> 01:04:45.096]  I mean, at every level, at every level.
[01:04:45.116 --> 01:04:48.718]  Again, when people say, oh, you defaulted, that's just ludicrous.
[01:04:49.038 --> 01:04:57.083]  I challenge anybody out there to find one other case where anybody participated in as much discovery as Alex Jones.
[01:04:57.123 --> 01:04:59.404]  That's the thing, the national headlines are, failed to show up.
[01:04:59.785 --> 01:05:02.506]  I've done like 14 depositions.
[01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:03.347]  You worked on the case.
[01:05:03.387 --> 01:05:03.967]  What have we given them?
[01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:06.249]  Oh, given more than anybody ever has.
[01:05:06.289 --> 01:05:08.892]  You gave them all the email that came into your junk email.
[01:05:09.193 --> 01:05:10.514]  So, I mean, you're talking about... What guys ordered that?
[01:05:10.795 --> 01:05:11.155]  Exactly.
[01:05:11.255 --> 01:05:18.744]  Millions of pages of documents, emails, your own personal private text, personal private financial... Oh, they called up and harassed Joe Rogan off our text.
[01:05:19.104 --> 01:05:19.424]  Completely.
[01:05:19.464 --> 01:05:20.705]  I mean, just one thing after the next.
[01:05:20.725 --> 01:05:21.906]  I mean, it's the most invasive.
[01:05:21.946 --> 01:05:24.348]  They called Joe Rogan off what we gave them.
[01:05:24.508 --> 01:05:24.768]  Exactly.
[01:05:24.788 --> 01:05:30.573]  And how would they know some of the information they're knowing that they're talking about in court unless you produced it on Discovery?
[01:05:30.633 --> 01:05:31.454]  They're showing emails.
[01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:34.336]  They're showing text while they say we never gave them anything.
[01:05:34.476 --> 01:05:34.916]  Exactly.
[01:05:34.936 --> 01:05:37.819]  They're able to exactly... And then we give them videos that are bait-stamped.
[01:05:37.839 --> 01:05:39.740]  They say, that's not evidence.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:40.100]  Exactly.
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:41.842]  Because he thinks the cameras are dumb.
[01:05:42.262 --> 01:05:42.422]  Right.
[01:05:43.442 --> 01:05:44.323]  And he's got away with it.
[01:05:44.363 --> 01:05:49.984]  The media's only told one side of the story, the court only wants one side of the story to be told, so the world can't know the truth.
[01:05:50.324 --> 01:05:52.045]  Is it safe to say it's blowing up in their face?
[01:05:52.525 --> 01:05:53.525]  Ultimately it will, yes.
[01:05:53.905 --> 01:06:02.528]  It's damaging the court of public opinion because if everything you'd heard bad about Alex Jones was true, they would be eager for all of the evidence to come forward.
[01:06:02.788 --> 01:06:06.229]  They would be eager for a trial by jury to hear everything.
[01:06:06.249 --> 01:06:06.929]  Now let's expand.
[01:06:06.949 --> 01:06:08.089]  What's this $150 million number?
[01:06:08.509 --> 01:06:10.230]  Because again, I don't have $2 million to put into this.
[01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:12.632]  So what is that about?
[01:06:12.452 --> 01:06:14.452]  about just to make it just sound outrageous?
[01:06:14.452 --> 01:06:18.772]   Well this is part of their... the reason why they had to do a fake story is they're saying
[01:06:18.772 --> 01:06:23.971]   that there's 75 million Americans that have doubts about Sandy Hook and that the only
[01:06:23.971 --> 01:06:26.772]   reason any of them have doubts about Sandy Hook is solely and wholly because of...
[01:06:27.652 --> 01:06:30.013]  He said, every one of these 75 million, it's because of him.
[01:06:30.254 --> 01:06:31.154]  How do you prove that?
[01:06:31.494 --> 01:06:33.535]  And then because they question, I'm guilty?
[01:06:33.795 --> 01:06:34.356]  Well, exactly.
[01:06:34.396 --> 01:06:35.616]  There's two major problems with it.
[01:06:35.656 --> 01:06:36.437]  Well, three major problems.
[01:06:36.557 --> 01:06:37.517]  One, his data is wrong.
[01:06:37.737 --> 01:06:39.058]  He's misstating what the data is.
[01:06:39.298 --> 01:06:41.699]  But secondly, what they're really doing is just asking questions.
[01:06:41.979 --> 01:06:46.581]  But third is, you are not primarily responsible for why people had doubts about Sandy Hook.
[01:06:46.821 --> 01:06:48.522]  You followed what other people were covering.
[01:06:48.562 --> 01:06:49.983]  And they're trying to criminalize that questions.
[01:06:50.223 --> 01:06:51.624]  But that's why they can't let the truth out.
[01:06:51.764 --> 01:06:54.306]  If they let the truth out, everybody knows their whole premise is false.
[01:06:54.326 --> 01:06:55.527]  Their whole story is false.
[01:06:55.547 --> 01:06:58.109]  Their whole caricature is, in fact, a caricature.
[01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:59.050]  And they lose.
[01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:00.191]  They lose in the court of law.
[01:07:00.231 --> 01:07:02.053]  They lose in the court of public opinion.
[01:07:02.113 --> 01:07:04.915]  But this is them attempting to get rid of jury trials, because they did it with Bannon.
[01:07:05.195 --> 01:07:07.377]  They had a jury trial, but they said he can't cross-examine.
[01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:08.317]  Right, exactly.
[01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:11.999]  He couldn't confront the main witness against him, Benny Johnson, the head of the committee.
[01:07:12.259 --> 01:07:13.780]  Wasn't even allowed to subpoena him.
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:16.021]  Wasn't even allowed to subpoena the Speaker of the House.
[01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:18.762]  Isn't that the Constitution, like, right to face your accuser?
[01:07:18.922 --> 01:07:19.362]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:07:19.382 --> 01:07:23.044]  It's the right of confrontation, right in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
[01:07:23.124 --> 01:07:24.985]  It's the seventh right on jury trial.
[01:07:25.045 --> 01:07:25.685]  That's exactly right.
[01:07:25.945 --> 01:07:28.547]  So the Sixth Amendment is right... Fifth Amendment, right to due process.
[01:07:28.727 --> 01:07:30.628]  Sixth Amendment, right to confrontation.
[01:07:30.708 --> 01:07:33.249]  Seventh Amendment, right to trial by jury.
[01:07:33.609 --> 01:07:35.210]  They've just gone through England doing this to us.
[01:07:35.490 --> 01:07:40.314]  Well, if you look at it, they managed to, it's like a checklist, a bill of rights that they've been violating in the Alex Jones case.
[01:07:40.354 --> 01:07:44.277]  First Amendment right of freedom of press, right of freedom of speech, right of freedom of association.
[01:07:44.517 --> 01:07:48.180]  Second Amendment right of self-defense and to speak out in the name and protection of self-defense.
[01:07:48.461 --> 01:07:53.024]  Fourth Amendment right to privacy, that's been eviscerated throughout the trial, throughout the discovery process.
[01:07:53.084 --> 01:07:54.485]  Fifth Amendment right to due process.
[01:07:54.525 --> 01:07:59.109]  Sixth Amendment right to confront those against you by being able to present meaningful evidence on your own behalf.
[01:07:59.369 --> 01:08:01.153]  7th Amendment right to a trial by jury.
[01:08:01.193 --> 01:08:04.661]  They're eviscerating all of it in just one single show trial.
[01:08:04.822 --> 01:08:08.911]  Yeah, my lawyer's literally, he's been a former federal prosecutor, he just doesn't seem to like it.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:24.228]  I gotta tell you, this book, The Great Reset and The War for the World, the left and the mainstream media are going to have to sit there and we've got to force them to respond to this book.
[01:08:25.029 --> 01:08:26.730]  This book is that important.
[01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:28.711]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter.
[01:08:29.072 --> 01:08:42.681]   If you compare the finest, and I'm telling you, you take MIT Technology Review, you take Science, take all these magazines and journals, add the electronic part of it, and, you know, NPR, PBS, all of it, I'll take it.
[01:08:42.801 --> 01:08:49.823]  I'll match up and we'll go through and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there.
[01:08:50.044 --> 01:08:54.125]  And if you're a sentient human being and just watching it, you say, well, God, Alex Jones was ahead of this.
[01:08:54.165 --> 01:08:55.385]  Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[01:08:55.445 --> 01:08:57.686]  They're just in this huge revolution.
[01:08:58.065 --> 01:09:03.065]   against choice and free will and normal technological development
[01:09:03.065 --> 01:09:06.065]  and adoption of technology that empowers humanity.
[01:09:06.065 --> 01:09:13.065]   Instead, they want adoption of technology, forced adoption, world IDs, global social credit scores, carbon taxes
[01:09:13.065 --> 01:09:16.065]  that dominate and monitor every facet of our lives.
[01:09:16.065 --> 01:09:20.065]   You make the case of what the not just the new world order is,
[01:09:20.065 --> 01:09:27.065]   but using this great reset to really take up their whole idea of control and authoritarianism.
[01:09:27.547 --> 01:09:36.815]  They have decided to trigger a controlled collapse and then bring in a new dark age to control the general public where they will be in their Elysium fields.
[01:09:37.055 --> 01:09:39.317]  There is no new technology coming in.
[01:09:39.337 --> 01:09:40.158]  They're blocking that.
[01:09:40.758 --> 01:09:46.764]  And so really they're just imploding things under the Clarence Pippen model to show that they can get that control over us.
[01:09:47.164 --> 01:09:49.106]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter.
[01:09:49.166 --> 01:10:02.037]  He has presented tons of valid evidence and facts that I think have been really, really important to raising consciousness to what this sort of technocratic global elite really want to do.
[01:10:02.497 --> 01:10:11.484]   The true thing that you've done, which is stunning, If you look at the evidence of that and the facts, you are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:10:12.084 --> 01:10:12.945]  That is very rare.
[01:10:13.025 --> 01:10:16.627]  You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[01:10:17.467 --> 01:10:24.111]  This book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, I'm telling you, everybody in America, the people that hate Alex Jones the most have to read this book.
[01:10:24.691 --> 01:10:25.612]  This is no beatry.
[01:10:26.312 --> 01:10:27.513]  You're not going to be flipping pages here.
[01:10:27.533 --> 01:10:29.835]  You're going to be having a pen out and you're going to be underlining stuff.
[01:10:30.155 --> 01:10:30.736]  It's amazing.
[01:10:31.256 --> 01:10:35.320]  The Great Reset and the War for the World by Alex Jones.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:47.290]   Available now on Amazon or InfoWarsStore.com Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, Robert Barnes guest
[01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:47.720]  hosting.
[01:10:48.186 --> 01:11:06.083]   Today we're going to be talking about a range of topics, including whether Donald Trump will sue the CNN for the various lies and libels they've been telling now for years, whether or not the Biden administration has a credible case to try to indict President Trump. Whether the continued weaponization of our
[01:11:06.083 --> 01:11:11.882]   legal system will lead to the criminalization of innocent content around the
[01:11:11.882 --> 01:11:14.253]   world, not only in terms of the freedom of press and the freedom
[01:11:14.253 --> 01:11:18.042]   of speech, but the freedom of association and political expression as well.
[01:11:18.042 --> 01:11:23.333]   But first, let's look at a major another FBI whistleblower disclosure that was
[01:11:23.333 --> 01:11:28.563]   brought forward by Congressman Jim Jordan today.
[01:11:27.458 --> 01:11:56.207]   If you go all the way back to the end of the Cold War, the FBI's first effort to create a domestic extremism movement, That it could then use to legitimate and justify invasive powers of surveillance, various misuse of prosecutorial resources, bigger and fatter and broader budgets in a post-Cold War era, which Russia could no longer, the Soviet Union could no longer be used as the predicate to justify those invasive surveillance powers or that expansive budget.
[01:11:56.787 --> 01:11:58.388]  Well, you just go back to PatCon.
[01:11:58.809 --> 01:12:01.010]  PatCon was something that was hidden for decades.
[01:12:01.411 --> 01:12:17.564]  PatCon was where the FBI was creating its own militia to help inspire a militia movement in the United States that it could then turn around and demonize to justify invasive surveillance powers, political suppression of dissident speech and thought, and excess budgets.
[01:12:18.024 --> 01:12:23.669]  Well, it has come out today that a similar kind of activity is taking place at the FBI again.
[01:12:24.289 --> 01:12:35.496]  That the FBI has been told by the Biden administration, everyday FBI agents, that they have to dummy up and drum up cases of so-called domestic extremism even when they don't exist.
[01:12:36.277 --> 01:12:41.961]  What's supposed to happen is a crime is reported or uncovered and the FBI investigates.
[01:12:42.341 --> 01:12:46.484]  What is not supposed to happen is the FBI creating the crime in the first place.
[01:12:46.844 --> 01:12:52.948]  What is not supposed to happen is the FBI going out there and looking to do a check in the box like a speeding ticket cop.
[01:12:53.268 --> 01:12:55.149]  Like, oh, I got to meet my quota this week.
[01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:59.891]  I got to get 30 speeding tickets, so I better go out there and find somebody I can nail with a speeding ticket.
[01:13:00.311 --> 01:13:05.072]  That's effectively what's happening at institutional levels within the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[01:13:05.333 --> 01:13:22.479]  And it has gotten so egregious and so bad that multiple FBI agents have stepped forward and come forward to Congressman Jim Jordan and others and blown the whistle on this Justice Department corruption and political collusion taking place at the Biden Justice Department.
[01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:28.702]  Basically saying, hey, go out there and even if the case isn't domestic extremism, call it domestic extremism.
[01:13:29.062 --> 01:13:30.642]  Label it domestic extremism.
[01:13:30.903 --> 01:13:39.907]  This explains the desire to tag innocent political First Amendment conduct as illicit criminal domestic extremism.
[01:13:40.247 --> 01:13:56.853]   Because FBI agents are under major pressure to dummy up and drum up fake cases of domestic extremism in order to meet their performance metrics In order to be able to keep their job or to get boosted up and promoted through the hierarchy.
[01:13:57.253 --> 01:14:05.636]  So that disclosure by Congressman Jordan today is just further evidence of the complete and utter uselessness that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has become.
[01:14:06.016 --> 01:14:14.819]  It has become thoroughly, completely, politically weaponized at the very top hierarchical level and that has in effect corrupted everything beneath it.
[01:14:15.239 --> 01:14:18.220]  This follows the disclosure earlier just this week.
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:25.685]  That the FBI illicitly suppressed and improperly closed the Hunter Biden laptop case.
[01:14:26.105 --> 01:14:36.053]  That in fact what happened was that the FBI agents knew of the laptop, knew of its authenticity, knew of its legitimacy, knew of the criminal conduct it exposed.
[01:14:36.353 --> 01:14:38.915]  You're talking about daily crimes in America.
[01:14:39.315 --> 01:14:42.780]  You're talking about complicity and participation in human trafficking.
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:45.684]  You're talking about massive drug abuse.
[01:14:46.044 --> 01:14:48.728]  You're talking about illicit possession of drugs.
[01:14:48.748 --> 01:14:50.330]  You're talking about major bribery.
[01:14:50.610 --> 01:14:52.473]  You're talking about felony gun charges.
[01:14:52.693 --> 01:14:56.839]  You're talking about crime after crime after crime after crime after crime.
[01:14:57.159 --> 01:15:07.764]  Being done day by day by day by day by day by someone who clearly almost wants the world to know how completely messed up his life is.
[01:15:08.104 --> 01:15:13.247]  How he has become a criminal reprobate because it indicts by implication his father.
[01:15:13.607 --> 01:15:20.693]  And that doesn't even get to the biggest crimes listed in the various items on the laptop and in the latest leaks.
[01:15:21.133 --> 01:15:32.001]  It shows continuous bribery going on, continuous money laundering going on, involvement with illicit intelligence services in places like China and Russia and elsewhere.
[01:15:32.382 --> 01:15:37.826]  You're talking about extensive criminal conduct that endangers the national security of the nation.
[01:15:38.226 --> 01:16:00.169]  Beyond the blackmail file that's available if anyone ever had access to it or was part of those various honey traps or drug traps or anything else that was present, you have admissions, you have communications, you have conversations, you have documentation, you have actual financial transactions with a pattern that goes back to then-Vice President and now-President Joe Biden.
[01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:05.715]  And so it comes out that they knew it was legit, they knew it was real, but what did the FBI do?
[01:16:06.176 --> 01:16:15.968]  The FBI closed the file claiming it was Russian disinformation, that it was fake, and leaked that to the press in order to suppress that story from coming to fruition.
[01:16:16.408 --> 01:16:18.089]  Now who did all of this happen under?
[01:16:18.549 --> 01:16:21.630]  It all happened under Attorney General William Barr.
[01:16:21.690 --> 01:16:28.352]  InfoWars was one of the few places to raise questions and doubts and skepticism about Attorney General Barr.
[01:16:28.772 --> 01:16:36.174]  Pointing out that Barr's history was his dad was the headmaster who put and hired Jeffrey Epstein in the first place.
[01:16:36.654 --> 01:16:43.076]  It was William Barr's father who gave Jeffrey Epstein access to underage girls at the very beginning when he didn't even qualify for the job.
[01:16:43.516 --> 01:16:52.443]  It was William Barr's father who wrote very interesting books about sexual misbehavior towards underage girls while he was a headmaster of a school with underage girls.
[01:16:52.964 --> 01:17:10.698]  And then of course William Barr got his big break working for Poppy Bush and covering up the CIA's illicit activities and destroying files and committing other illicit acts on behalf of the Bush family and the Central Intelligence Agency right during the mid-1970s when they were under major inquiry from the Church Committee and others in Congress.
[01:17:11.258 --> 01:17:21.766]  Then of course it was Barr who helped cover up a wide-ranging corruption when he was the Attorney General under Poppy Bush himself, including ties to Noriega, money laundering, drug trafficking, etc.
[01:17:22.227 --> 01:17:36.258]  So it shouldn't come as any surprise that it was Attorney General Barr that was presiding over the FBI when all of this was happening, nor should it shock us that Biden has accelerated it, but what should shock us and disturb us is that it's happening at the scale and the scope and the speed that it is.
[01:17:36.758 --> 01:17:39.263]  When we come back, will Biden indict Trump?
[01:17:39.583 --> 01:17:40.905]  Does he have credible charges?
[01:17:41.226 --> 01:17:42.528]  Will Trump sue CNN?
[01:17:42.749 --> 01:17:44.432]  Will Trump finally start to fight back?
[01:17:44.812 --> 01:17:47.677]  What about Birx admitting she was lying to us all along?
[01:17:49.329 --> 01:17:51.569]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:17:51.609 --> 01:17:54.270]  This is Robert Barnes guest hosting this part of the show.
[01:17:54.810 --> 01:17:57.671]  Later on, we'll be discussing whether or not Biden and the D.C.
[01:17:57.711 --> 01:18:05.272]  grand jury have enough evidence to indict Donald Trump, or whether it is entirely trumped up charges without merit.
[01:18:05.712 --> 01:18:13.834]  Also, whether or not Trump will sue, successfully, CNN for defamation and libel for the litany of false statements they have made over the years.
[01:18:14.614 --> 01:18:24.482]  But first, other disclosures from the Freedom of Information Act and whistleblowers about the role of the CDC in colluding with big tech to censor dissident voices.
[01:18:25.163 --> 01:18:45.497]   According to the published reports and the emails, some of which I've seen, published at Justin Hart, published by America First Legal, which is Stephen Miller's organization that has brought some good litigation in the country, some successful litigation, to be distinguished from the American First Policy Institute, Which is basically a warmongering institute backed by big oil money.
[01:18:45.877 --> 01:18:53.841]  The America First Legal by Stephen Miller is an organization that is dedicated to actually improving the legal well-being of ordinary Americans in the country.
[01:18:54.441 --> 01:18:56.962]  They made a Freedom of Information Act request.
[01:18:57.002 --> 01:19:05.725]  And by the way, for anybody out there, you too, anyone can make a request under the Freedom of Information Act for any particular information that you want.
[01:19:05.805 --> 01:19:21.692]   If you want to know what the government knows about you, what records they're keeping about you, You can request through the Freedom of Information Act, as well as the Privacy Act, a range of information that's in the government's files, appealing to specific government agencies that may have your information.
[01:19:21.732 --> 01:19:25.334]  You can get all of the information the Internal Revenue Service has on you.
[01:19:25.614 --> 01:19:28.355]  You can get all the information the FBI has on you.
[01:19:28.715 --> 01:19:31.176]  You can get the information the CIA has on you.
[01:19:31.876 --> 01:19:39.741]   Now, of course, Alex Jones's file would probably be too long for him to ever read it all, But you can actually get that information yourself as part of the process.
[01:19:39.761 --> 01:19:40.421]  So remember that.
[01:19:40.481 --> 01:19:41.142]  There are ways.
[01:19:41.182 --> 01:19:42.423]  You don't need a lawyer to do it.
[01:19:42.723 --> 01:19:44.324]  You don't have to be a lawyer to do it.
[01:19:44.784 --> 01:19:53.030]  Any ordinary American can request this information, including information about other people, historical figures, public figures, ongoing public controversies.
[01:19:53.490 --> 01:19:54.551]  That's what happened here.
[01:19:55.011 --> 01:20:15.524]  America First Legal made a request for information about what exactly was the Center for Disease Control, the CDC, doing in terms of its interactions and communications and conversations with Big Tech, with Google, with Facebook, with YouTube, with Twitter, and with social media giants like Snapchat and others.
[01:20:16.104 --> 01:20:17.104]  And that's what they requested.
[01:20:17.344 --> 01:20:25.827]  Just give us what you have communicated to those agencies within a certain time frame about any topic concerning censorship or conversation.
[01:20:26.167 --> 01:20:34.270]  Well, some of those files have now been released and disclosed and now divulged to the world at a range of places across the internet.
[01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:46.296]  And what we see is that there has been extensive collusion between the CDC and the FDA and Big Tech to censor and suppress dissident voices in the social media space.
[01:20:46.737 --> 01:20:56.222]  This is in fact part of Robert Kennedy's and the Children's Health Defense lawsuit against Facebook, currently pending before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
[01:20:56.622 --> 01:21:23.093]  They documented and demonstrated how there had been targeted censoring, algorithmic manipulation, outright misrepresentations about CHD, Children's Health Defense, and Robert Kennedy in the process because of their independent information, warning about the risk of lockdowns, warning about the risk of vaccines, warning about the risk of all of our pandemic policy responses, and how they could harm not only children, but Americans across the age spectrum.
[01:21:23.513 --> 01:21:33.543]  Well, this information shows that, in fact, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention coordinated with social media companies and Google to censor users.
[01:21:33.863 --> 01:21:39.448]  In other words, not just censor commentators, not just censor media sources, to censor users.
[01:21:40.109 --> 01:21:58.188]  Who expressed any skepticism or criticism of COVID-19 vaccines according to a trove of international of internal communications obtained by America First Legal and shared in this particular instance with the Washington Beacon.
[01:21:58.929 --> 01:22:17.368]  Over the course of the last six months, starting in December of 2020, not coincidentally, right after our election fornication in November of 2020, CDC officials regularly communicated with personnel at Twitter, Facebook, and Google over, quote, vaccine misinformation.
[01:22:17.948 --> 01:22:32.559]   At various times, CDC officials themselves Would flag specific posts by users, just users, ordinary people, on social media platforms such as Twitter as quote-unquote example posts to make an example of.
[01:22:33.439 --> 01:22:39.299]   In one email to a CDC staffer, a Twitter employee said, quote, he is looking forward to setting
[01:22:39.299 --> 01:22:42.798]  up regular chats with the agency.
[01:22:42.798 --> 01:22:48.878]   Other emails show the scheduling of meetings with the CDC and these various social media
[01:22:48.878 --> 01:22:54.478]   giants over how to monitor speech related to COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:22:54.478 --> 01:23:00.259]   Indeed, the efforts to police information also resulted in absolutely admitted mistaken
[01:23:00.259 --> 01:23:01.958]  acts of censorship.
[01:23:01.958 --> 01:23:05.759]  Of course, any act of censorship is mistaken by definition.
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.462]  Indeed, the question is, why isn't Big Tech held liable?
[01:23:08.882 --> 01:23:18.229]  Part of this is because of Section 230 and its misapplication and misappreciation by the court system, as Justice Thomas has repeatedly identified and noted.
[01:23:18.729 --> 01:23:33.598]  This is because Big Tech treats itself as immune thanks to the courts buying into the idea that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act passed all the way back in 1997, related to allegations concerning the Wolf of Wall Street, no less.
[01:23:34.538 --> 01:23:42.702]  We're of a kind in order to limit all efforts to regulate, or govern, or discipline, or hold accountable Big Tech.
[01:23:43.202 --> 01:24:09.317]   Traditionally in America, any person who breaches their contract, who makes a promise to you, but then breaks that promise, sometimes called promissory estoppel, if they do so under equitable relief, or they make a promise to you that they get to induce you to participate in their product, called fraud in the inducement, All of these things are actionable either under contract law, tort law, or equitable law.
[01:24:09.777 --> 01:24:12.760]  Yet none of those state claims are allowed against Big Tech.
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:13.200]  Why?
[01:24:13.681 --> 01:24:23.590]  Because Big Tech has re- because the big courts have reinterpreted Section 230 to say that anything Big Tech does is beyond the reach of the law.
[01:24:23.871 --> 01:24:26.073]  They're just completely and utterly immune.
[01:24:26.613 --> 01:24:32.795]  Now this is, as Justice Thomas has noted, a complete incorrect assessment of Section 230.
[01:24:33.475 --> 01:24:39.577]  And the Supreme Court of the United States itself has never lended clarity to this area critically needing it.
[01:24:39.937 --> 01:24:56.625]   Which means we need Congress and the new Congress come 2022 and definitely come 2024 with a new presidency to rewrite Section 230 to make clear That any immunity is conditioned on Big Tech complying with First Amendment principles.
[01:24:57.125 --> 01:25:06.333]  I was in a debate recently with a lawyer, a friend of mine from the left, who didn't understand why it is that I supported First Amendment principles being applied to Big Tech.
[01:25:06.393 --> 01:25:07.294]  And the reason is this.
[01:25:07.854 --> 01:25:09.976]  The argument, it goes all the way back to the U.S.
[01:25:09.996 --> 01:25:12.018]  Supreme Court dealing with company towns.
[01:25:12.518 --> 01:25:15.581]  Back in the old days, you had these companies would own the whole town.
[01:25:16.281 --> 01:25:25.026]  And consequently, they could prohibit people from organizing to support unions, organizing to support other workers, organizing to oppose the company at any level.
[01:25:25.902 --> 01:25:28.704]  Whether it's in its economic policy, financial, or political policy.
[01:25:29.145 --> 01:25:34.029]  It also is a way to scam the workers, overcharge the rent, overcharge the food, because you run the whole town.
[01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:38.332]  And the only person you can complain to is the company sheriff, not your sheriff.
[01:25:38.773 --> 01:25:53.725]  And so, in order to deal with that issue, the question was, when a company owns the public square, has a monopoly over the public square, do you still have a First Amendment right of expression, association, press, and speech, and to petition your government in that context?
[01:25:54.165 --> 01:25:54.405]  The U.S.
[01:25:54.425 --> 01:26:05.852]  Supreme Court said, yes you do, that when a private entity has a monopoly over the public square, then the First Amendment must apply to that private monopoly.
[01:26:06.413 --> 01:26:10.976]  The same principle was applied by the California Supreme Court in a case called Pruneyard.
[01:26:11.436 --> 01:26:22.103]  There you had a private shopping mall, and in the public square section of the private mall, people often got together to petition for candidates and causes of their choice.
[01:26:22.583 --> 01:26:24.284]  Then the malls decided to start limiting it.
[01:26:24.664 --> 01:26:30.308]  And the California Supreme Court said, no, you can't do that under the same principle that had been established by the U.S.
[01:26:30.328 --> 01:26:31.469]  Supreme Court before.
[01:26:31.969 --> 01:26:44.238]  Which is that when you have a monopoly on the public square, a private monopoly on the public square converts that square into a constitutionally protected square for speech.
[01:26:44.798 --> 01:26:45.758]  My argument is simple.
[01:26:46.119 --> 01:26:52.181]  The First Amendment shouldn't apply to everybody out there in terms of private citizenry and private companies.
[01:26:52.641 --> 01:26:57.583]  It should only apply to those private companies that have a monopoly on the public square.
[01:26:58.004 --> 01:26:59.804]  That is uniquely, and what is a monopoly?
[01:26:59.824 --> 01:27:00.164]  Does it mean 100%?
[01:27:01.645 --> 01:27:01.865]  No.
[01:27:01.965 --> 01:27:07.427]  Historically, in American law, monopoly is just 70% or more of that particular space.
[01:27:07.907 --> 01:27:11.248]  Well, Twitter has 70% or more of that particular space.
[01:27:11.608 --> 01:27:15.249]  Google has 70% or more of that space.
[01:27:15.609 --> 01:27:16.369]  Same with YouTube.
[01:27:16.789 --> 01:27:17.549]  Same with Facebook.
[01:27:17.589 --> 01:27:24.651]  Indeed, on average, it gets to the level of 95% is the degree of monopoly they hold over the public square.
[01:27:25.171 --> 01:27:30.552]  In that context, we should take the same premises, the same principles, the same precepts, the U.S.
[01:27:30.572 --> 01:27:46.035]  Supreme Court applied previously, the California Supreme Court applied in Pruneyard, and say that Big Tech, when they choose to monopolize the public square, is subject to the same First Amendment limiting principles as is any other company town.
[01:27:46.135 --> 01:27:48.696]  Because these are de facto company towns.
[01:27:49.016 --> 01:27:54.861]  The digital public square and big tech space have become the company towns of today.
[01:27:55.202 --> 01:27:57.744]  And we must protect freedom and liberty in that context.
[01:27:58.084 --> 01:28:01.027]  But it's going to require a conscientious court to do so.
[01:28:01.528 --> 01:28:04.690]  When we come back, does Biden have enough evidence to indict Trump?
[01:28:04.831 --> 01:28:10.175]  Or will it be as much of a kangaroo court as the case is in Alex Jones here in Travis County, Texas?
[01:28:10.676 --> 01:28:12.758]  That and more after we come back after the break.
[01:28:13.118 --> 01:28:15.301]   Remember everybody, You are the front of the line.
[01:28:15.601 --> 01:28:16.242]  Hold the line.
[01:28:16.502 --> 01:28:21.748]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and keep InfoWars alive and on the air for everybody to hear.
[01:28:22.909 --> 01:28:24.531]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:24.611 --> 01:28:31.419]  Robert Barnes guest hosting up a little bit later, evaluating the possible risk of indictment of Donald Trump.
[01:28:32.119 --> 01:28:35.642]  The new fake drudge report is predicting he's in deep, deep, deep trouble.
[01:28:35.943 --> 01:28:36.563]  Is he really?
[01:28:37.044 --> 01:28:43.950]  Or is this another kangaroo court, another scam criminal proceeding, much like many of the January 6th committee hearings have been?
[01:28:44.610 --> 01:28:52.537]  But up now, a special report about the risk of digital currencies that I've often talked about with George Gammon and others.
[01:28:53.098 --> 01:28:58.223]  In particular, Senator Manchin and the Democrats and Senator Sinema have appeared to have come to an agreement on a budget.
[01:28:58.823 --> 01:29:04.411]  And as part of that budget, they have proposed a 15% corporate tax rate that's really about a global tax rate.
[01:29:04.771 --> 01:29:08.917]  And that global tax rate is really about creating a global digital currency.
[01:29:09.017 --> 01:29:10.039]  That's the first step in it.
[01:29:10.439 --> 01:29:13.223]  So let's listen to this video breaking down that risk.
[01:29:17.125 --> 01:29:28.213]  Recently the central bank digital currencies have been the talking point at the global confabs because they lead to the creation of a global currency system.
[01:29:28.493 --> 01:29:34.738]  Good afternoon everybody and welcome to the session on resetting digital currencies.
[01:29:35.278 --> 01:29:40.242]  The theme of this year's forum as you know is a crucial year to rebuild trust.
[01:29:40.903 --> 01:29:48.785]   The digital payment system can help reduce these logistical costs, can help reduce remove the dangers of holding cash.
[01:29:48.785 --> 01:29:55.785]   As the architects of multiple global crises pour on the tyranny, the IMF is enjoying
[01:29:55.785 --> 01:30:01.426]   an elevated position as the problem solver most nations turn to for help,
[01:30:01.426 --> 01:30:03.945]  racketeering on a global scale.
[01:30:03.945 --> 01:30:10.865]   With all the current issues on our agenda, we tend to forget that we are in the midst
[01:30:10.865 --> 01:30:16.746]   of the fourth industrial revolution, which accelerates global change
[01:30:16.746 --> 01:30:22.586]   in much more comprehensive and faster ways than the previous three revolutions.
[01:30:22.936 --> 01:30:28.239]  The objective is to quickly recognize the potential of new technologies.
[01:30:28.619 --> 01:30:32.542]  History is truly at a turning point.
[01:30:33.122 --> 01:30:40.007]  We do not yet know the full extent and the systemic and structural changes which will happen.
[01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:50.629]  However, we do know that global energy systems, food systems, and supply chains will be deeply affected.
[01:30:51.349 --> 01:31:06.263]  And as Bloomberg gleefully reported, key Democratic congressional allies are urging President Joe Biden's administration to support a new injection of resources for countries at the IMF to help them deal with the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
[01:31:06.363 --> 01:31:18.207]  To the tune of at least $650 billion in additional IMF reserve assets, the demand is being led by Representative Pramila Jayapal and Senator Elizabeth Warren.
[01:31:18.447 --> 01:31:30.511]  Zero Hedge recently put the puzzle pieces together concerning the Democrats' proposed $650 billion flooding of the IMF with special drawing right funds.
[01:31:30.971 --> 01:31:33.472]  What are special drawing right funds?
[01:31:34.672 --> 01:31:43.582]  The Special Drawing Rights, or SDR, was created by the IMF in 1969 to supplement the official reserves of its member countries.
[01:31:44.924 --> 01:31:55.835]  The SDR is an interest-bearing international reserve asset that can only be held by the IMF, its member countries, and designated official entities known as prescribed holders.
[01:31:56.696 --> 01:32:03.818]  In addition to this role, the SDR serves as the unit of account of the IMF and several other international organizations.
[01:32:04.218 --> 01:32:09.279]  Zero Hedge writes, each new crisis brings global banks closer to their goal.
[01:32:09.539 --> 01:32:18.381]  The introduction of national digital currencies and the SDR basket become the de facto reserve trading tool for the world.
[01:32:18.641 --> 01:32:23.222]  Why do Democrats specifically want aid denominated in SDRs?
[01:32:24.002 --> 01:32:26.866]  Because funding allocations in the U.S.
[01:32:27.126 --> 01:32:32.212]  have already hit their maximum, and new funding bills are being defeated in the Senate.
[01:32:32.473 --> 01:32:35.636]  At the IMF, there are no checks and balances.
[01:32:35.977 --> 01:32:42.445]  They can ask for almost any amount of money in the form of SDRs without oversight.
[01:32:42.725 --> 01:32:52.807]  There are always strings attached when it comes to the IMF, and in exchange for SDRs, the globalists will certainly want more centralized control.
[01:32:53.067 --> 01:32:56.708]  The Ukrainian war is not merely a money laundering operation.
[01:32:56.988 --> 01:33:06.970]  It is a linchpin to transfer the global economy out of the money printing of central banks, and directly into the hands of globalists controlling the IMF.
[01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:13.484]  We are being looted in real time of our property, currency, sovereignty, and our very lives.
[01:33:13.806 --> 01:33:20.806]  John Bowne reporting.

[01:33:48.633 --> 01:33:49.754]  It's high quality vitamins and minerals.
[01:33:49.834 --> 01:33:50.234]  Okay, great.
[01:33:50.574 --> 01:33:53.476]  People love it because it tastes great and they see the results.
[01:33:53.936 --> 01:33:55.017]  And it funds the InfoWar.

[01:34:09.446 --> 01:34:10.947]  But who knows with supply chain breakdowns?
[01:34:11.747 --> 01:34:14.389]  It is surreal to actually be living inside the New World Order.

[01:34:18.328 --> 01:34:25.208]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, back in stock, 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:34:25.208 --> 01:34:26.208]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:34:26.208 --> 01:34:32.047]   It is surreal to actually be living inside the New World Order.
[01:34:32.047 --> 01:34:38.087]   It is bizarre to read all their white papers and battle plans from 50, 60, 70 years ago
[01:34:38.087 --> 01:34:41.288]  and now to see it all being implemented.
[01:34:41.288 --> 01:34:46.009]   What's truly horrifying is we know what their battle plans call for in the next phase, a
[01:34:46.009 --> 01:34:48.368]  90% foresty population of the planet.
[01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:57.794]  They have recruited an army of control freaks and pedophiles and scum and criminals of every sort to build their new world order army.
[01:34:57.814 --> 01:35:15.973]   And they have the big private central banks and their funding, they have the corporate media, they have most of the courts, but they don't have our hearts, our minds, and they don't have control of your soul, If we simply realize that God is the answer and reach out to God to give us discernment, to lead God and direct us, we are unstoppable together.
[01:35:15.993 --> 01:35:19.436]  Now, InfoWars is under unprecedented globalist attack.
[01:35:19.476 --> 01:35:22.379]  I'm quite frankly proud of it, even though it's very daunting.
[01:35:22.679 --> 01:35:25.761]  But I know I have the living God inside my soul.
[01:35:25.781 --> 01:35:29.785]  I have the power of the overcomer inside of me, and so do you, and we're going to win this.
[01:35:30.894 --> 01:35:41.178]  If we just continue to resist the tyrants, not because we hate these evil people, but because we love our children and we love the innocents that are counting on us to stand up and speak out and fight back.
[01:35:41.499 --> 01:35:42.979]  Now, the cavalry's here.
[01:35:43.059 --> 01:35:44.800]  So many of our best-selling products have been sold out.

[01:36:29.032 --> 01:36:30.872]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:36:30.834 --> 01:36:32.516]  This is Robert Barnes guest hosting.
[01:36:33.076 --> 01:36:39.621]  A little bit later we'll be discussing whether or not Biden has sufficient evidence to actually indict Trump or whether it's simply a bluff.
[01:36:40.421 --> 01:36:47.307]  And whether or not the state of Georgia may be bringing charges under the politically motivated district attorney there in Fulton County.
[01:36:48.086 --> 01:36:51.008]  But first up, an answer to Alex Berenson.
[01:36:51.709 --> 01:37:00.135]  Alex Berenson was on Twitter the other day, suggesting that anyone who defended Alex Jones should be ashamed of themselves and that he will be blocking them.
[01:37:00.875 --> 01:37:09.962]  My response was that Alex Berenson should feel ashamed for even making such a statement, given his own issues and concerns with fundraising and other related matters.
[01:37:10.002 --> 01:37:14.025]  If you have a log in your eye, don't go around looking for the speck in other people's eyes.
[01:37:14.725 --> 01:37:31.296]  Alex Berenson's response was to buy into the entire media narrative that the case has nothing to do with the First Amendment, has nothing to do with the Constitution, has nothing to do with due process of law, has nothing to do with trial by right of jury.
[01:37:31.937 --> 01:37:32.877]  But that's the problem.
[01:37:32.977 --> 01:37:38.041]  He simply accepted the media's narrative without looking at the actual facts.
[01:37:38.601 --> 01:37:42.464]  For those out there that want the actual facts, the actual facts are still the same.
[01:37:43.164 --> 01:37:50.649]  Alex Jones and Infowars produced more discovery than any defendant in a media defamation case than I have ever heard of.
[01:37:51.329 --> 01:37:57.113]  Indeed, you don't have to doubt that because you can simply listen to what the plaintiffs are talking about in court.
[01:37:57.513 --> 01:38:01.616]  The emails, the documents, the text, the videos, the financial information.
[01:38:02.016 --> 01:38:09.422]   And that shows you, as well as a wide range of video clip excerpts from depositions, And that tells you, huh?
[01:38:09.522 --> 01:38:14.107]  They said that there was no attempts to meaningfully do any discovery in the case.
[01:38:14.148 --> 01:38:21.716]  Well, if that is the case, then how is it they have all of these emails, all of these documents, all of these texts, all of these depositions?
[01:38:22.677 --> 01:38:35.723]  In fact, in that context, if you dig deep and if you dig further, what you will see and what you will witness is extraordinary participation by InfoWars and Alex Jones to an unparalleled and unprecedented degree in discovery.
[01:38:35.763 --> 01:38:40.646]  Discovery that, in my view, violated their First Amendment right of speech, press, and association.
[01:38:40.966 --> 01:38:41.466]  How so?
[01:38:41.866 --> 01:38:47.289]  They demanded that InfoWars try to turn over or disclose various whistleblower reports that they had received.
[01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:51.731]  Tried to force InfoWars to disclose what other members of the press they've ever talked to.
[01:38:52.051 --> 01:39:01.339]  Whether it's Joe Rogan or anyone else, demanded they actually try to get the InfoWars records of InfoWars consumers and donors and contributors.
[01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:14.191]  They failed in that effort due to the effort to object to it, but they were able to obtain a wide range of other financial information about members of InfoWars that they were not constitutionally entitled to under First or Fourth Amendment principles.
[01:39:14.611 --> 01:39:18.194]  So this is the degree to which they partook and participated in discovery.
[01:39:18.794 --> 01:39:22.097]  Alex Berenson would know this had he actually done his job.
[01:39:22.417 --> 01:39:27.481]  Had he actually done a little bit of due diligence and researched and reviewed the actual facts in the case.
[01:39:27.981 --> 01:39:31.204]  Here, by the way, is a red flag and you can use it for other cases.
[01:39:31.704 --> 01:39:41.710]  If you hear somebody has done something bad within a judicial proceeding that warrants their denial of their constitutional right or liberty, see if they're really specific about what that was.
[01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:49.014]  Here you've heard lots of stories about how Infowars didn't participate in discovery, but they never tell you how, do they?
[01:39:49.294 --> 01:39:52.176]  They never tell you what document was it that wasn't turned over?
[01:39:52.496 --> 01:39:54.377]  What deposition was it that wasn't done?
[01:39:54.718 --> 01:39:56.198]  What information wasn't presented?
[01:39:56.238 --> 01:40:00.518]   What information did they not ultimately already have or obtain by independent third party
[01:40:00.518 --> 01:40:01.518]  sources?
[01:40:01.518 --> 01:40:02.957]  They don't tell you any of that.
[01:40:02.957 --> 01:40:08.018]   And that's because they know it's a made up case of discovery noncompliance.
[01:40:08.018 --> 01:40:10.478]  This has been extraordinary discovery compliance.
[01:40:10.478 --> 01:40:14.917]   So in that context, this case already violates Infowars First Amendment rights because it
[01:40:14.917 --> 01:40:19.678]   allows a legal theory of the case to move forward that violates the constitutional principle
[01:40:19.678 --> 01:40:24.018]   of colloquium, which requires that you talk about a specific person.
[01:40:24.018 --> 01:40:29.597]   You identify that person by image or by name and that you say a specific fact about them,
[01:40:29.597 --> 01:40:34.357]   not a theory, and a factual item that can be confirmed by a jury.
[01:40:34.368 --> 01:40:42.513]  If you can't, then it's a violation of the First Amendment rights of freedom of the press, freedom of the speech, and freedom of association, and freedom of expression, the freedom to ask questions.
[01:40:42.533 --> 01:40:46.036]  That's why the right to petition our government is part of the First Amendment.
[01:40:46.716 --> 01:40:48.557]  So that's the first violation.
[01:40:48.577 --> 01:41:06.671]  The next violation was the Second Amendment right, because this speech was about your right to defend yourself with the Second Amendment, and that includes the right to bear and carry arms, as the Indiana gentleman did, that saved lives, as a person in West Virginia did just about a month ago, and saved lives, as happened all across America, and saves lives.
[01:41:07.111 --> 01:41:11.855]  It was a Fourth Amendment violation by the violation of the rights to privacy and a wide range of information.
[01:41:12.195 --> 01:41:15.658]  Just because you've been sued doesn't mean you forfeited your right to privacy.
[01:41:16.018 --> 01:41:24.345]  You still have the right to privacy under the Fourth Amendment that requires the court show and meet a certain high standard, the more intimate or private that information is.
[01:41:24.705 --> 01:41:29.749]  That right was routinely and flagrantly violated by the plaintiffs and even the courts in this case.
[01:41:30.209 --> 01:41:32.632]  The Fifth Amendment right is the right to due process of all.
[01:41:33.113 --> 01:41:33.754]  What does that mean?
[01:41:33.874 --> 01:41:41.663]  The due process of law entitles you to bring the same motions to dismiss, anti-slap motions, motions for summary judgment that everyone else has.
[01:41:42.064 --> 01:41:45.909]  And yet InfoWars has been denied that right in every single Sandy Hook case.
[01:41:46.289 --> 01:41:47.809]  No right to bring a motion to dismiss.
[01:41:47.969 --> 01:41:51.030]  No right to bring a motion under the anti-slap laws.
[01:41:51.370 --> 01:41:53.230]  No right to bring a motion for summary judgment.
[01:41:53.470 --> 01:41:57.071]  Indeed, only one court even heard those motions on the merits.
[01:41:57.491 --> 01:42:10.834]  And the Texas Supreme Court passed on getting involved at the preliminary stage when, frankly, they could have and should have and likely will regret that they didn't as they see the mockery and travesty of justice unfolding before our very eyes in Travis County, Texas.
[01:42:11.354 --> 01:42:17.276]  Then you have the Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against you, including those presenting evidence from the other side.
[01:42:17.637 --> 01:42:20.418]  In this context, that has been routinely and repeatedly denied.
[01:42:20.818 --> 01:42:32.163]  Cross-examination by presenting the full context of videos and documents has been systematically and continuously excluded by the court, even when the other side had agreed to those videos prior to trial.
[01:42:32.603 --> 01:42:39.125]   Indeed, Alex Jones is not even allowed to tell the jury that he repeatedly said Sandy Hook happened in many instances over the years.
[01:42:39.425 --> 01:42:55.029]  He's not allowed to tell the jury that for the mistakes that he made and the questions that he asked were the wrong questions, he has recognized and admitted and accepted responsibility for the things he got wrong, unlike CNN, unlike the New York Times, unlike, frankly, Fox News.
[01:42:55.589 --> 01:42:59.253]  So in that same context, then you get to the 7th Amendment right to trial by jury.
[01:42:59.533 --> 01:43:06.921]  This is why you cannot just routinely, flagrantly dismiss cases or default witnesses or exclude a jury from hearing evidence.
[01:43:07.381 --> 01:43:12.627]  That's because of the right to trial by jury, which goes all the way back to the Magna Carta itself.
[01:43:13.227 --> 01:43:15.910]  You're talking about eight centuries of history here, folks.
[01:43:16.170 --> 01:43:17.732]  That's how important this right was.
[01:43:18.132 --> 01:43:26.318]  Because we want to make sure that juries decide the facts, that juries decide the evidence, that juries decide the truth, not judges.
[01:43:26.759 --> 01:43:35.125]  Not judges who have political biases and personal prejudices and class biases that can shade their perception of the case.
[01:43:35.586 --> 01:43:43.292]  That's why you can't issue a default judgment outside of extreme and extraordinary circumstances that did not exist in this case.
[01:43:43.772 --> 01:43:52.199]  So the Alex Jones case is a case to see how many constitutional rights they can take away, they can strip, they can violate.
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:44:01.047]  Because if they can do it to Alex Jones, then you can guarantee, just like the social media censorship and suppression that took place, they are coming for you next.
[01:44:01.608 --> 01:44:04.390]  Once again, we are all Alex Jones.
[01:44:04.871 --> 01:44:14.942]   When we come back after the break, we're going to be discussing whether or not Joe Biden has the evidence and the goods to indict Donald Trump, or whether it's just more trumped up charges.
[01:44:15.363 --> 01:44:17.304]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:44:17.964 --> 01:44:19.725]  This is Robert Barnes guest hosting.
[01:44:20.726 --> 01:44:22.207]  Is Trump going to be indicted?
[01:44:23.255 --> 01:44:25.056]  Is Trump going to sue CNN?
[01:44:25.957 --> 01:44:31.401]  The possibilities of Trump getting indicted continue to mount, particularly in the state of Georgia.
[01:44:32.021 --> 01:44:46.952]  And there they are, but it appears that they are paralleling the same structure according to leaks from various FBI and Justice Department individuals about a pending grand jury in the District of Columbia where there have been extensive search warrants, extensive subpoenas, and the rest.
[01:44:47.532 --> 01:44:53.816]  This, by the way, shows the difference between the Durham investigation and a real investigation.
[01:44:54.277 --> 01:45:01.141]  That if Durham was serious, you would have heard many search warrants, you would have heard of many subpoenas, you would have heard of many witnesses.
[01:45:01.201 --> 01:45:01.882]  You never did.
[01:45:02.141 --> 01:45:05.141]  That was a sign that Durham was never the real deal.
[01:45:05.141 --> 01:45:09.541]   He was there to cover up the degree of corruption at the highest ranks.
[01:45:09.541 --> 01:45:14.141]   The goal, just as Mueller was there to cover up everything that took place involving Spygate,
[01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:19.742]   Durham was the cleanup guy to make sure that anything that went wrong with Spygate
[01:45:19.742 --> 01:45:28.820]   was not blamed on John Brennan, was not blamed on James Clapper, was not blamed on people like James Comey, was not blamed
[01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:33.911]   on Peter Stroke, was not blamed on anybody like that, but was instead blamed
[01:45:33.911 --> 01:45:36.641]  on low-level, mid-tier outsiders.
[01:45:36.739 --> 01:45:49.086]   And then even when then he brought charges, he brought them in cases like the District of Columbia, where he knew the jury was likely to acquit just because the defendant was anti-Trump.
[01:45:49.667 --> 01:45:54.810]  And so the same pattern has revealed in reverse when it relates to the D.C.
[01:45:54.910 --> 01:45:58.253]  grand jury and the Fulton County grand jury going after Trump.
[01:45:58.653 --> 01:46:11.722]  There have been extensive subpoenas, search warrants, a wide range of invasive investigative techniques that show they are desperate, scorched earth level desperate, to try to find anything they can use to indict Trump.
[01:46:12.183 --> 01:46:13.544]  But did Trump commit a crime?
[01:46:14.184 --> 01:46:18.168]  Well, I was part of the Trump election team in Georgia.
[01:46:18.689 --> 01:46:20.190]  And the answer is no.
[01:46:20.410 --> 01:46:26.256]  The only crime were the crimes he was exposing, not the crimes he partake and participated in.
[01:46:26.697 --> 01:46:33.744]  It's important to remember out there on the election contest context what the president's election contest was all about.
[01:46:34.244 --> 01:46:36.945]  Here they're claiming the electors are fake electors.
[01:46:37.165 --> 01:46:38.145]  That's utter hogwash.
[01:46:38.425 --> 01:46:45.687]  That would be like saying every time a candidate names electors, they're fake electors unless those are the ones that Congress ultimately determines to accept.
[01:46:46.287 --> 01:46:48.408]  Everybody is competing electors.
[01:46:48.428 --> 01:46:49.808]  Those aren't fake electors.
[01:46:50.028 --> 01:46:51.708]  They're competing electors.
[01:46:52.008 --> 01:46:57.970]  That if you win your election contest, one remedy can be for a court to appoint them as the electors.
[01:46:58.410 --> 01:47:02.431]  Also another remedy is for the state legislature to appoint them as electors.
[01:47:02.711 --> 01:47:09.801]  And even another remedy is for Congress itself to appoint them as electors, or of course you could just have a new election.
[01:47:10.141 --> 01:47:18.172]  You have to name what your competing electors are to make it easy for courts or Congress or state legislatures to give remedy.
[01:47:18.572 --> 01:47:20.255]  That's all President Trump did.
[01:47:20.775 --> 01:47:28.077]  All he did was make it easily available and accessible for the courts or Congress or state legislatures to give effective remedy.
[01:47:28.417 --> 01:47:30.197]  He didn't put forward fake electors.
[01:47:30.457 --> 01:47:31.738]  These people are all real!
[01:47:32.138 --> 01:47:39.880]  The whether or not they were accepted as electors was a question for the courts, a question for Congress, a question for the state legislatures.
[01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:45.861]  By definition, until the electors were chosen, they could not be legally fake electors.
[01:47:46.181 --> 01:47:51.406]  That makes the DC grand jury investigation a fake, fraudulent investigation.
[01:47:51.766 --> 01:47:56.730]  That makes the investigation out of Fulton County, Georgia a fake, fraudulent investigation.
[01:47:57.090 --> 01:48:08.340]  What it shows is Democrats are willing to weaponize all lawfare everywhere, whether it's prosecutorial power, whether it's state power, whether it's federal power, whether it's judicial power, whether it's lawsuit power.
[01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:14.385]  To go after and tar and feather, sometimes quite literally, their political opponents and adversaries.
[01:48:14.765 --> 01:48:19.109]  Well, unfortunately, Republicans and conservatives have mostly sat on their hands.
[01:48:19.610 --> 01:48:20.431]  Look at Hunter Biden.
[01:48:20.871 --> 01:48:26.036]  Hasn't Hunter Biden committed crimes in a whole bunch of counties and a whole bunch of states all across the country?
[01:48:26.636 --> 01:48:43.819]  Where are the state prosecutors or county prosecutors stepping up to the plate to make sure he is held accountable for all of his continuous daily filmed himself selfies, his crime selfies, that's what Biden makes, are crime selfies on a daily basis.
[01:48:44.179 --> 01:48:47.140]  Why has none of them stepped up to the plate and brought prosecution?
[01:48:47.439 --> 01:48:51.538]   Well, there are these fake fraudulent charges brought against President Trump,
[01:48:51.538 --> 01:48:56.858]   or being investigated against President Trump in Georgia and in the District of Columbia.
[01:48:56.858 --> 01:49:01.339]   So the short answer is, there is no case against President Trump for committing any crime
[01:49:01.339 --> 01:49:03.618]  because President Trump didn't commit any crime.
[01:49:03.618 --> 01:49:06.219]  President Trump exposed the crime.
[01:49:06.219 --> 01:49:10.458]   And just as they went through and tried to find something in New York,
[01:49:10.458 --> 01:49:14.739]   the Manhattan went through all of his financial history, all of his personal history,
[01:49:14.739 --> 01:49:18.500]   all of his professional history, looked at everything he's ever done
[01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:22.859]   or even possibly could do, and they couldn't find one piece of evidence
[01:49:22.859 --> 01:49:25.739]  that Donald Trump had committed one single crime.
[01:49:25.902 --> 01:49:37.006]  They couldn't even reach the low level of probable cause of criminal conduct to go after him in New York for his entire history as a businessman in New York, as a public figure in New York.
[01:49:37.346 --> 01:49:39.447]  And they looked at literally everything.
[01:49:39.927 --> 01:49:52.870]  They went after people that simply worked for Trump on whether they got all of their T's crossed and all of their I's dotted correctly on minutiae like taxes and they still couldn't find a single thing that Trump did wrong.
[01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:57.551]  If that's the case, why do they think now they're going to suddenly find something he did wrong?
[01:49:57.911 --> 01:50:03.553]  This is an attempt to create a fake narrative around the issue of the election.
[01:50:03.693 --> 01:50:07.794]  And let's go back to the election and remember what about it was problematic.
[01:50:07.834 --> 01:50:13.416]   Sometimes people get caught up in Machines, they get caught up in difficult to prove conspiracy theories.
[01:50:13.816 --> 01:50:22.560]  You don't have to do that to realize the election fornication that took place in 2020 did not meet the constitutional standard of a presidential election.
[01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:23.801]  What does that mean?
[01:50:23.921 --> 01:50:32.385]  It means that in order to be constitutionally qualified, it needs to conform to the rules set by the state legislature and only the state legislature.
[01:50:32.845 --> 01:50:41.050]  Because under the Constitution, presidential elections are only determined by the legislative branch of the state government, not anybody else.
[01:50:41.630 --> 01:50:44.171]  So were there, the big questions were three-fold.
[01:50:44.652 --> 01:50:48.214]  Were there constitutionally unqualified voters who voted?
[01:50:48.554 --> 01:50:53.957]  Meaning voters who did not meet the standards under the state legislature's rules for voting in the presidential election.
[01:50:54.537 --> 01:50:59.260]  Second, were there ballots cast that were not constitutionally qualified ballots?
[01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:00.321]  What does that mean?
[01:51:00.421 --> 01:51:04.764]  It means ballots cast in conformity with the rules set by the legislature of each state.
[01:51:05.424 --> 01:51:12.089]  Third, was the canvassing and the counting of the ballots done in a constitutionally qualified manner?
[01:51:12.449 --> 01:51:16.952]  Once again, in accord with the rules and standards established by the legislature of each state.
[01:51:17.412 --> 01:51:20.413]  Here's the fact that they don't want to disclose and don't want to talk about.
[01:51:20.933 --> 01:51:46.861]  In Georgia, in Arizona, in Wisconsin, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, in Arizona, in Nevada, in all of these states, there were more constitutionally unqualified voters, more constitutionally unqualified ballots, and more constitutionally unqualified canvassing and counting of those ballots than there was the margin of victory in each one of those states for determining the presidential election winner.
[01:51:47.441 --> 01:51:52.565]  And all Trump needed was just a few of those states, not all of them, and it happened in all of them.
[01:51:52.905 --> 01:51:53.826]  You want the proof of that?
[01:51:54.587 --> 01:51:55.948]  One singular piece of proof.
[01:51:56.288 --> 01:52:02.513]  So if anybody else out there says, oh, there's no proof, that's all made up, etc., ask them one question.
[01:52:02.953 --> 01:52:13.081]  Name the county or state in any contested election context for a presidential election of 2020 where the state allowed and authorized a full signature match check.
[01:52:13.641 --> 01:52:22.251]  In other words, match the signatures on the absentee ballot envelopes that came in with their confidential secret signature on the voter registration file.
[01:52:22.911 --> 01:52:24.954]  And they do this all the time.
[01:52:24.994 --> 01:52:30.420]  In fact, Barack Hussein Obama got himself elected by using signature match checks to kick off his opponents.
[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:40.942]  Guess how many counties and how many states in November of 2020, or for the November 2020 election, did a single signature match ballot check on any major election?
[01:52:41.422 --> 01:52:41.782]  None of them.
[01:52:42.142 --> 01:52:42.522]  None of them.
[01:52:42.643 --> 01:52:42.943]  Why?
[01:52:43.283 --> 01:52:45.863]  Because they knew they had committed fraud.
[01:52:46.163 --> 01:52:50.404]  The fraud isn't what President Trump did in the election, it was what was done to him in the election.
[01:52:50.984 --> 01:52:53.865]  When we come back, we'll be discussing that and more.
[01:52:54.793 --> 01:52:58.438]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, Robert Barnes guest hosting.
[01:52:59.139 --> 01:53:02.224]  With us for the bottom half of the hour is Mark Grobaer.
[01:53:02.504 --> 01:53:09.854]  We're going to be discussing a little bit later, what risk does President Trump face that happened to Robert Kennedy in 1968?
[01:53:11.897 --> 01:53:18.503]  When Robert Kennedy was looking for possible revenge on the deep state for the assassination of his brother, John Kennedy.
[01:53:19.324 --> 01:53:23.628]  You can find Mark Robert America's untold stories on YouTube.
[01:53:23.648 --> 01:53:27.592]  You can also find them at unstructured.locals.com.
[01:53:28.152 --> 01:54:03.546]   The Americas Untold Stories, you find an extraordinary kind of mini documentary series that not only includes the sort of wild adventures of Mark Rober's life, that includes adventures between the UFOs and Moonies, National Lampoons, and World Weekly News, Investigative journalism exposing rehabs, but the better part of a half century independently investigating what took place and what transpired involving the assassinations of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, as well as the assassination of Robert Francis Kennedy, and others in the context of what took place in the 1960s and 1970s.
[01:54:05.826 --> 01:54:08.107]  So that is why you should go to America's Untold Stories.
[01:54:08.127 --> 01:54:11.287]  You can get the breakdown on LBJ and find out all about Jumbo.
[01:54:11.327 --> 01:54:13.068]  We won't detail that any further here.
[01:54:13.508 --> 01:54:19.050]  You can find all about a wide range of information and details there in terms of what happened to participants.
[01:54:19.330 --> 01:54:23.131]  Because it's a useful template, not just if you're interested and curious in history.
[01:54:23.431 --> 01:54:27.652]  And you want to know what happened at, you know, how did the Kennedy assassination happen?
[01:54:27.692 --> 01:54:28.372]  Who covered it up?
[01:54:28.672 --> 01:54:29.933]  What happened with Robert Kennedy?
[01:54:30.013 --> 01:54:30.473]  What happened?
[01:54:30.493 --> 01:54:33.175]  Was Saran Saran really the sole assassin?
[01:54:33.195 --> 01:54:36.217]  Or was there a whole nother story, as Mark has detailed?
[01:54:36.597 --> 01:54:38.178]  But also look at it for templates.
[01:54:38.539 --> 01:54:58.472]  These are the kind of people to look out for in the gray space operators who operate between the black and the white, the David Faireys of the world, who managed to be both inside and outside government one foot in both, like the Guy Banisters of the world, the Clay Shaws of the world, and the many other culprits that show up in the Kennedy assassination.
[01:54:59.012 --> 01:55:06.318]  And so, Ed, that is the context in which we'll be discussing today some of the lessons that Mark has learned in investigating the Kennedy assassination.
[01:55:06.779 --> 01:55:08.660]  So, Mark, glad you could be with us.
[01:55:09.581 --> 01:55:10.742]  Hey, great to see you, Robert.
[01:55:10.762 --> 01:55:12.303]  Wow, that was quick.
[01:55:13.104 --> 01:55:19.690]  What led to your interest in the first place in investigating what really happened in the Kennedy assassination?
[01:55:21.211 --> 01:55:22.952]  Well, I guess I grew up into it.
[01:55:23.012 --> 01:55:43.973]   I mean, when you're a certain age and you see Jack Ruby being killed on television, sitting there with your parents in Brooklyn, and he's killed in a police station in Dallas, the most least likely place for a suspect like Oswald to be killed by Ruby, in police custody, the most famous
[01:55:45.697 --> 01:55:59.107]  The perpetrator or, you know, alleged perpetrator at the time, surrounded by 50 to 60 Dallas police officers to have a man come in, a nightclub owner, stick a gun into his stomach and blow his guts out.
[01:55:59.667 --> 01:56:07.533]  And you're sitting at home from school watching that the same weekend that your president's head has been blown off in that same city.
[01:56:08.434 --> 01:56:12.137]  You begin to ask a few questions at that time as to why that happened.
[01:56:13.134 --> 01:56:20.856]  You know, I mean, really, like a lot of people, the first questions that came up, the first answers were provided by Mark Lane, who wrote Rush to Judgment.
[01:56:20.876 --> 01:56:24.177]  It becomes the number one bestseller on the New York Times bestseller list.
[01:56:25.018 --> 01:56:37.362]  Mark Lane, an attorney in New York and Greenwich Village who was actually JFK's Democratic campaign manager in that area of New York City for his campaign.
[01:56:37.442 --> 01:56:41.743]  Mark Lane comes to Dallas and talks to Oswald's mother.
[01:56:42.606 --> 01:56:44.768]  And becomes the attorney for her.
[01:56:45.368 --> 01:56:47.290]  She wants him to represent her son.
[01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:49.992]  At that time, he's already, obviously, deceased.
[01:56:50.873 --> 01:56:59.881]  But that's where Mark Lane begins this journey, which leads to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of books and documentaries about the Kennedy assassination.
[01:57:00.401 --> 01:57:23.639]   But the point that starts this thing is Mark Lane's book reaching number one on the bestseller list, and the CIA Coming out with a memorandum a couple years later in 67, saying to their media assets, as they call it in the document, that Mark Lane has to be called a conspiracy theorist.
[01:57:23.699 --> 01:57:24.740]  That's their new word.
[01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:27.501]  Their new phrase is conspiracy theorist.
[01:57:27.521 --> 01:57:34.665]  This is developed because of the success of Rush to Judgment, the book, as well as the documentary, Robert.
[01:57:35.105 --> 01:57:51.332]   So the CIA creates this phrase For the first time against an American citizen who has had success with a book and with a documentary, but is also digging into the deep state for the first time in real time.
[01:57:51.672 --> 01:58:01.741]  Mark Lane goes to Dallas and interviews everyone who are witnesses to the Tippett slaying and other situations that occurred that weekend.
[01:58:02.222 --> 01:58:04.544]  And he's really the only one who puts them on film.
[01:58:05.498 --> 01:58:16.706]  And you mentioned that the CIA originated the term and popularized the term conspiracy theorist purely to discredit those asking questions and challenging the narrative about the Kennedy assassination.
[01:58:17.207 --> 01:58:30.317]  We have a trial going on in Travis County, Texas attacking Alex Jones and you have people like Alex Berenson saying that it's okay because people shouldn't be allowed to ask certain questions about murder conspiracies.
[01:58:30.797 --> 01:58:38.339]  And the first thought that came to my mind was, what would have happened had they had this legal weaponization back in the 1960s?
[01:58:38.799 --> 01:59:15.288]   Could they have sued Mark Blaine into oblivion on the grounds that you've said something the Warren Commission doesn't agree with, you've said his famous book Rush to Judgment is an indictment of the Warren Commission, you've challenged and contested the institutional narrative, and there's people who, let's say they have some emotional tie to somebody, let's say they got Tibbets' widow, for example, Somebody that's willing to play ball, to bring suit and say, oh my goodness, how dare you challenge Lee Harvey Oswald's complicity, you've personally attacked me, you've emotionally destroyed me, I should be able to sue you in oblivion, and it was a bit of a shock to me to watch people like Alex Berenson celebrate this as somehow being a good idea.
[01:59:15.928 --> 01:59:26.230]  Could you talk about how critical it was, throughout exposing the truth about the Kennedy assassination, that people were able to ask questions without fear of being sued into oblivion?
[01:59:27.645 --> 01:59:32.991]  Well, you know, the suit into oblivion part, they didn't really have to go to that route.
[01:59:33.051 --> 01:59:43.342]  What they did was, back then, the Secret Service went to all the local Dallas news stations and asked and received the actual footage that they had shot.
[01:59:44.162 --> 01:59:46.564]  That was the way of suppressing the media back then.
[01:59:46.584 --> 01:59:57.932]  Let's just take the case of Parkland doctor, Dr. Perry, who says that in the press conference, stands up and says that Kennedy is shot through the throat.
[01:59:58.392 --> 02:00:03.516]  This is an entrance wound and that's filmed by DSU and all the Dallas stations.
[02:00:03.996 --> 02:00:09.840]  The Secret Service goes over to those news stations and asks and receives the footage.
[02:00:10.419 --> 02:00:12.521]  Of Dr. Perry saying that.
[02:00:12.541 --> 02:00:17.244]  A little bit more ham-handed, Robert, than what is going on today, ham-fisted.
[02:00:17.584 --> 02:00:18.545]  But that's what they did.
[02:00:18.585 --> 02:00:20.646]  They just bulldogged their way through it back then.
[02:00:21.047 --> 02:00:23.428]  You know, they didn't have to sue anybody.
[02:00:23.789 --> 02:00:36.538]  The suits that you're seeing now are because, you know, obviously the media censorship, which is extremely draconian today, even that is not enough to suppress the truth today.
[02:00:37.182 --> 02:00:38.063]  You know what I mean?
[02:00:38.083 --> 02:00:50.535]  Even that is not enough to put a clamp down because I think their biggest nightmare and why we're seeing the wizard behind the curtain is the broad width of the internet.
[02:00:51.215 --> 02:00:54.258]  They cannot get this beast under control.
[02:00:54.278 --> 02:01:14.246]   They cannot, and that's why they're going after Alex, because his millions of followers, his millions of viewers, They are trying to take down InfoWars, from what I understand, lock, stock, and two smoking barrels, so it doesn't operate at this level, because they can't put this genie back in the bottle.
[02:01:14.656 --> 02:01:16.617]  They cannot put a clamp down.
[02:01:16.878 --> 02:01:19.139]  I'm trying to compare it to how easy it was back then.
[02:01:19.579 --> 02:01:25.423]  You know, for the Secret Service to literally go into WDSU in Dallas and give us the goddamn footage, bro.
[02:01:25.563 --> 02:01:26.563]  You know what I mean?
[02:01:26.563 --> 02:01:27.563]  Well, absolutely.
[02:01:27.563 --> 02:01:32.882]   I mean, it shows the importance of Alex Jones and Infowars is it's the best deterrent against
[02:01:32.882 --> 02:01:36.523]  deep state malfeasance because of its ability to expose it.
[02:01:36.523 --> 02:01:39.981]   And thus they have to come up with new and creative ways to suppress and censor that
[02:01:39.981 --> 02:01:43.002]  were unavailable to them back in the 1930s.
[02:01:43.002 --> 02:01:48.242]   When we come back after the 1960s and the 1930s, when we come back after the break,
[02:01:48.242 --> 02:01:52.722]   we'll be discussing with Mark Rober, the deep state plot to kill president presidential
[02:01:52.722 --> 02:01:58.403]   candidate Robert Kennedy, whether President Trump faces any risk of that as well.
[02:01:58.403 --> 02:02:02.483]   That in more topics with Mark Rober and you again, you can find all of his detailed mini
[02:02:02.483 --> 02:02:09.403]   documentaries, many stories of all of this deep state corruption exposure at America's
[02:02:09.403 --> 02:02:12.563]  untold stories on YouTube and rumble.
[02:02:12.592 --> 02:02:14.614]  That's America's Untold Stories.
[02:02:14.934 --> 02:02:18.417]  You should go and subscribe now to enjoy the benefit of that exclusive information.
[02:02:19.625 --> 02:02:21.546]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:02:21.586 --> 02:02:27.911]  This is Robert Barnes, guest hosting, here interviewing Mark Rober at America's Untold Stories.
[02:02:27.951 --> 02:02:29.552]  That's where you can find him on YouTube.
[02:02:29.572 --> 02:02:33.355]  You can also find him at unstructured.locals.com.
[02:02:33.915 --> 02:02:36.957]  People then ask me, and people often ask me, what books I'm reading.
[02:02:37.337 --> 02:02:43.417]   Mark recently gave me a big book on a certain general up near Dallas known as General Walker
[02:02:43.417 --> 02:02:45.817]  that he's doing a treatment of.
[02:02:45.817 --> 02:02:51.037]   Also has a treatment of Oswald, also has a treatment of RFK, and has been doing these
[02:02:51.037 --> 02:02:53.016]  America's Untold Stories in the interim.
[02:02:53.016 --> 02:02:56.856]   I can tell you the book I'm most looking forward to reading in addition to the book on General
[02:02:56.856 --> 02:03:00.016]  Walker will be this one.
[02:03:00.016 --> 02:03:01.737]  On Alex Jones, The Great Reset.
[02:03:02.703 --> 02:03:03.784]  Just listen to Steve Bannon.
[02:03:04.125 --> 02:03:09.990]  He loves to read populist books of great intellectual valor and quality, and he recommends the book.
[02:03:10.270 --> 02:03:12.051]  So you can go and pre-order it now.
[02:03:12.091 --> 02:03:16.375]  You can even pre-order one and get Alex Jones' personal signature on the inside.
[02:03:16.695 --> 02:03:19.117]  So I recommend it at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:03:20.038 --> 02:03:43.091]  Mark, both in unraveling what took place in the Kennedy assassination, you did a deep dive, looked at hundreds of hours of documentaries, hundreds and hundreds of books, gone through wide-ranging original source material, the best informed person on the Kennedy assassination that I've ever met, and you've been detailing little bits and pieces, little vignettes of the story at America's Untold Stories.
[02:03:43.611 --> 02:03:46.833]  I think a big part of that story is what followed up in 1968.
[02:03:48.254 --> 02:03:55.703]  You testified at the Saran Saran parole hearing, detailing and objecting to his continued detention and imprisonment.
[02:03:56.164 --> 02:04:06.476]  And as you've noted in the two-part series on RFK, his assassination and your treatment, RFK must die, that hopefully will be produced soon.
[02:04:07.177 --> 02:04:19.086]  That the Kennedy assassination, Robert Kennedy, was not assassinated by a lone, crazy, nutman, nut in the Saran Saran, as was popularly portrayed and presented in the Court of Public Opinion.
[02:04:19.866 --> 02:04:26.892]  In that context, you mentioned the relevance and significance of both the fact that the Deep State is who assassinated John F. Kennedy.
[02:04:27.672 --> 02:04:37.317]  Is that Robert Kennedy said, just I think a couple of days before his assassination, his intention to reopen the investigation into his brother's assassination.
[02:04:37.758 --> 02:04:40.939]  That everybody kind of knew it was a revenge tour for Bobby Kennedy.
[02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:50.925]  That if he got back into the White House, he was going to undo the damage that had been done by the deep state and correct what his brother was attempting to correct at the time of his assassination.
[02:04:51.445 --> 02:04:55.729]  Unfortunately, we never got to see what that looked like because he was assassinated soon thereafter.
[02:04:56.329 --> 02:05:12.724]  Can you describe for people how much is the Deep State the best evidence that the Deep State is the real culprit for the assassination of John Kennedy and that it was likely Deep State operators and affiliates and associates and motivation that was behind the assassination of his brother Robert Kennedy?
[02:05:13.991 --> 02:05:33.455]  Well, we were just talking about the other day on the show, myself and Eric Hundley, how Jock Whitney, this is some new revelation I had, Jock Whitney of the Whitney New York, Whitney Museum family owned the New York Herald-Tribune, for instance, just to give you an example of some obscure little tidbit that people don't realize.
[02:05:33.515 --> 02:05:37.416]  Multi-millionaire, owned the Tribune in New York.
[02:05:37.896 --> 02:05:48.860]   He wakes up on November 22nd, 1963 and must have gotten a phone call because he goes to work And makes himself into a copywriter that day.
[02:05:49.341 --> 02:06:01.370]  And he writes, on November 22nd, the first printed editorial calling Lee Harvey Oswald a lone assassin of JFK in a New York newspaper.
[02:06:02.386 --> 02:06:05.489]  Now, he has never written an article for the New York Herald Tribune.
[02:06:05.869 --> 02:06:07.711]  He's the publisher and owner.
[02:06:08.151 --> 02:06:13.696]  But he wakes up that morning, Robert, and he has a cup of espresso from Midtown Manhattan.
[02:06:13.716 --> 02:06:26.787]  He walks over to the office and he sits down and he writes the editorial that becomes the first ever in print story that Oswald is the lone assassin of JFK.
[02:06:27.188 --> 02:06:37.441]   Now, the reason that's important Is A, how fast it was done, and B, how deep this guy is into the deep state as a Whitney doing it.
[02:06:38.042 --> 02:06:39.183]  So, dig that.
[02:06:39.643 --> 02:06:51.272]  Here's a guy, he's a multi-millionaire, but he gets a phone call saying, listen, Jock, he's named Jock because he owned all these horses and was a big horse racing fanatic.
[02:06:52.332 --> 02:06:54.934]  But he's summoned to go to work and write the editorial.
[02:06:55.295 --> 02:07:01.964]   That is how quickly And how fast the payback of being a member of the Deep State
[02:07:02.901 --> 02:07:08.285]  It's kind of like the Godfather on a gritty level, on a downscale level, you see it in the Godfather.
[02:07:08.685 --> 02:07:14.929]  You know, someday we're going to come to you, you know, the funeral director, and you're going to have to do something for us.
[02:07:15.229 --> 02:07:24.976]  Well, on a MAGA scale, and I mean that MAGA meaning gigantic, not Trumpian, on a huge scale, that's how the Deep State works.
[02:07:25.336 --> 02:07:31.120]  A guy at the level, a level, of Jock Whitney, of the Whitney Museum family.
[02:07:31.623 --> 02:07:37.783]   could get a call saying, "Buddy, you got to go to work today and write this bullshit that we
[02:07:37.783 --> 02:07:42.823]   came up with and this story." And he goes, "Oh yeah, I'm going over right now." Now that's just
[02:07:42.823 --> 02:07:48.583]   an example of the deep state in regarding JFK. I mean, the snuffing out of witnesses.
[02:07:48.894 --> 02:07:52.195]  I mean, having Dulles on the Warren Commission, that's a deep state move.
[02:07:52.616 --> 02:07:56.577]  He'd already been, you know, the arch nemesis of JFK, fired by him.
[02:07:56.857 --> 02:08:04.601]  So, of course, the last guy you would want to investigate your murder is the guy who ran the operation that you fired.
[02:08:04.661 --> 02:08:06.202]  So that's, you know, that's crazy right there.
[02:08:06.262 --> 02:08:07.782]  But we all know that stuff.
[02:08:07.863 --> 02:08:21.400]   I mean, but what we're getting into now, including with you, is, you know, looking at this thing from a military angle, from the military angle Of a General Charles Cabell, who was fired as a second in command of the CIA.
[02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:28.204]  Of somebody like a General Walker, who's a two-star general in Dallas, Texas, who was fired by JFK.
[02:08:28.644 --> 02:08:35.869]  Somebody like Curtis Bombs Away LeMay, a four-star general who despised JFK.
[02:08:36.545 --> 02:08:50.773]  And said we have to nuke Cuba immediately, who said repeatedly that if the Japanese had won the war, he would have been tried and executed as a war criminal and rightfully so for killing over 300,000 Japanese in the firebombing of Tokyo civilians.
[02:08:51.213 --> 02:08:55.975]  So these were the arch nemesis of JFK and RFK.
[02:08:56.476 --> 02:09:04.380]  The bottom field level people, you know, the rubies running around at the street level, that's what people get to look at.
[02:09:05.117 --> 02:09:08.862]  You know, the people that are running around the dirty, filthy, you know, street-level cats.
[02:09:09.243 --> 02:09:16.013]  But up above are these puppet masters of the deep state, Robert, who have been doing this maybe going back to the 30s.
[02:09:17.054 --> 02:09:38.143]  And speaking of which, how much risk, like people have asked me what's the most analogous comparison to Trump's presidential campaign, and like the only time someone was in the presidency and went at the deep state and was removed, or wasn't re-elected by any means, was really John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy's attempts to return that power to the people.
[02:09:38.863 --> 02:09:52.237]  How much risk does Trump have that he faces a consequence in 2024 or in its approachment, if they're not able to indict him, if they're not able to politically take him out, that he faces a similar risk of the fate of Robert Kennedy did in 1968?
[02:09:52.277 --> 02:09:53.018]  A risk of assassination.
[02:09:55.140 --> 02:09:55.520]  This way.
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:57.942]  LBJ worked the same way.
[02:09:58.362 --> 02:10:01.004]  LBJ tried to intimidate.
[02:10:01.264 --> 02:10:02.745]  He tried to bribe.
[02:10:02.945 --> 02:10:03.706]  He would pay you.
[02:10:04.126 --> 02:10:06.087]  He would pay you to do his bidding.
[02:10:06.427 --> 02:10:07.988]  He would bribe you to do his bidding.
[02:10:08.229 --> 02:10:12.632]  And if none of that worked, then he would call up a Mack Wallace and have you killed.
[02:10:13.452 --> 02:10:14.653]  He would just say, take care of him.
[02:10:14.833 --> 02:10:16.434]  This is what the way LBJ did it.
[02:10:16.934 --> 02:10:28.141]   So I believe after they have exhausted 900 impeachments and indictments against Trump, We see what happens to a Lee Zeldin up in upstate New York.
[02:10:28.461 --> 02:10:29.782]  They just come at you with a knife.
[02:10:30.242 --> 02:10:36.384]  I mean, this is a guy running for the Republican seat as governor of the state of New York.
[02:10:36.964 --> 02:10:51.110]  A congressman, a United States congressman, is attacked in broad daylight by a man with a knife who comes inches away from stabbing him in the throat, if not for a United States Marine who intercedes there.
[02:10:52.622 --> 02:10:55.603]  He is then released immediately without bail.
[02:10:56.063 --> 02:11:08.387]  I mean, this, you know, is showing you when they're stalking United States Supreme Court justices, Robert, like Kavanaugh, and nobody bats an eye.
[02:11:08.907 --> 02:11:13.748]  You talk about dog whistles, they're literally doing it a different way now.
[02:11:14.028 --> 02:11:16.829]  They're sending out a mad dog whistle, as I call it.
[02:11:17.165 --> 02:11:20.188]  You know, they're not hiring a guy, you know, with a resume.
[02:11:20.208 --> 02:11:21.809]  They're just sending out a broad net.
[02:11:22.149 --> 02:11:32.258]  But if that broad net doesn't work, then you've got to get into a Sirhan-Thane-Eugene-Caesar plot that can be rather complicated.
[02:11:32.578 --> 02:11:42.306]  But I'm sure there's a bunch of these on the board that are ready to go against Trump, because he, like Alex Jones, have become these lightning rods of truth.
[02:11:43.010 --> 02:11:59.982]  In the American zeitgeist, in the American pop culture, in American history, and they will apparently go to any length to stop Jones and to stop Trump from getting back into power because they know that these guys are coming for them if they get back into power.
[02:12:00.302 --> 02:12:00.803]  You know what I mean?
[02:12:00.823 --> 02:12:11.410]  Like Kennedy, like you said, he spoke in March of 1968 right here in the Valley at what's now Northridge University.
[02:12:12.048 --> 02:12:23.396]  He said that he, for the first time, and he had never said this before, many of the Kennedy aides documented this, that if he's elected president, he's going to reopen the investigation into his brother's murder.
[02:12:23.777 --> 02:12:24.237]  Exactly.
[02:12:25.438 --> 02:12:27.840]  In less than a week or so later, he was dead.
[02:12:28.300 --> 02:12:29.722]  Thanks, Mark, for joining us.
[02:12:29.922 --> 02:12:32.584]  You can follow him at America's Untold Stories.
[02:12:32.624 --> 02:12:34.566]  You can follow him at Lord Buckley Twitter.
[02:12:34.606 --> 02:12:37.730]  You can follow him at unstructured.locals.com.
[02:12:38.150 --> 02:12:45.217]  But again, go to America's Untold Stories on YouTube or unstructured.locals.com to get inside information on a continuous level.
[02:12:45.277 --> 02:12:48.676]   Thanks everybody for joining us and Alex Jones show will be back tomorrow
[02:12:48.676 --> 02:13:01.777]   We are now living in the void sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what
[02:13:01.777 --> 02:13:09.288]   we've known and what's to come and And right now, the most important thing to remember is, don't panic.
[02:13:09.748 --> 02:13:16.929]  Stay calm, because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe, sound course.
[02:13:17.269 --> 02:13:21.310]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules.
[02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:23.772]  And building our own society.
[02:13:24.192 --> 02:13:26.414]  All we gotta do is survive the crash.
[02:13:26.794 --> 02:13:29.376]  And right now, we still have time to prepare.
[02:13:29.796 --> 02:13:33.599]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[02:13:33.999 --> 02:13:36.821]  It's time to convert it into hard assets, now.
[02:13:37.282 --> 02:13:40.204]  Including food, water, and survival gear.
[02:13:40.384 --> 02:13:42.286]  To keep us strong and at the ready.
[02:13:42.605 --> 02:13:46.845]  Go to preparetoday.com for the essentials.
[02:13:46.845 --> 02:13:54.746]   Storable foods, water filtration, first aid, power, and more at preparetoday.com.
[02:13:54.746 --> 02:14:02.425]   Hey everybody, Jason Burmess here in for Alex Jones in the fourth hour.
[02:14:02.425 --> 02:14:10.765]   And over the next 60 minutes or so, we are going to be discussing the historical significance
[02:14:10.765 --> 02:14:17.364]   of the Bohemian Grove, which by the way, is taking place right now, right now.
[02:14:16.955 --> 02:15:05.087]   Right now with zero media coverage whatsoever within the context of not only the military industrial complex former and today I assure you there are arms deals bank deals digital currency deals and food deals taking place in the Sonoma Redwoods right now but also In the regards of our history in compartmentalization, the executive within the executive, the very deep state that Robert Barnes was just discussing, and props to Robert Barnes talking about Bill Barr as a modern day part of that.
[02:15:05.107 --> 02:15:05.968]  And guess what?
[02:15:06.949 --> 02:15:12.551]  Bill Barr just happens to be in the Napa Valley right now giving speeches.
[02:15:12.631 --> 02:15:16.952]  I wonder if he might stop at the Grove.
[02:15:17.572 --> 02:15:52.772]   You see, once I found out that the Manhattan Project was hatched there, and that's where compartmentalization was taken to the next level, and we started to have these programs that were, what, born classified post-World War II, which we'll get into, I realized That this was not only a birthing place for the type of policies that led to technology that can totally dominate and change the world, humanity as a whole, but there was also a spiritual aspect to this.
[02:15:53.533 --> 02:16:05.732]   And so, over the last decade and a half, what I've done is I've amassed a slew of their own internal annals.
[02:16:05.772 --> 02:16:08.353]  For instance, this is their sixth annal here, 1973 to 1987.
[02:16:08.833 --> 02:16:18.016]  And when I talk about the military-industrial complex and I talk about the Deep State, okay, I want you to see this picture right here.
[02:16:18.796 --> 02:16:21.097]  Well, I guarantee his son will be in attendance.
[02:16:21.883 --> 02:16:28.445]  But right there you have George Bush with all those gentlemen in the middle dressed as spooks!
[02:16:29.085 --> 02:16:37.908]  Remember, George Bush will become the vice president of Reagan after being the CIA director.
[02:16:38.768 --> 02:16:39.108]  Okay?
[02:16:40.048 --> 02:16:47.821]   And there is zero, let me say this again, zero media coverage That this is happening right now.
[02:16:47.921 --> 02:16:59.129]  On top of that, we're going to take you into the historical spiritual aspect of this as well by showing you a man called George T. Bromley, the high priest of Bohemia.
[02:16:59.709 --> 02:17:01.531]  This book is his biography.
[02:17:01.591 --> 02:17:03.332]  As you can see, the owl's on the boat.
[02:17:03.792 --> 02:17:06.715]  The owl is also on the bind.
[02:17:07.535 --> 02:17:11.478]  And this book is dedicated to the Bohemian Club.
[02:17:11.518 --> 02:17:25.943]   In fact, I would suspect that this very copy right here was actually owned by a member of the Bohemian Grove, because what you're looking at right here is the obituary of Bromley.
[02:17:26.643 --> 02:17:42.325]   And in this book, he not only discusses his meeting with John D. Rockefeller, but he describes the ritual for neophytes or initiates Into the Bohemian Club as he is the High Priest.
[02:17:42.565 --> 02:17:51.290]  He also discusses other aspects of the occult and rituals via Druids, Aztecs and others.
[02:17:52.050 --> 02:17:53.411]  So this is an important topic.
[02:17:53.451 --> 02:17:57.193]  We're going to hit several of the annals and that biography.
[02:17:57.233 --> 02:17:58.954]  We've got eight annals here, folks.
[02:17:59.054 --> 02:18:05.878]  I don't know that there's anybody outside of the club itself that has as much of this historical information.
[02:18:06.458 --> 02:18:12.263]   And let's not forget, Alex Jones is the one that broke the cremation of care wide open.
[02:18:12.283 --> 02:18:17.668]  We're going to be describing that ritual in Bromley's own words as well.
[02:18:17.688 --> 02:18:30.000]  We're going to be getting into the Great Reset, the New World Order, the technology behind all of this post-World War II, the Good Shepherd, Top Gun Maverick, believe it or not, and so much more.
[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:35.404]   So, If you want to know this stuff, you're going to have to hang on, and we are going to be there shortly.
[02:18:35.465 --> 02:18:37.346]  But first, Alex's War.
[02:18:37.706 --> 02:18:38.986]  It's premiering tomorrow.
[02:18:39.427 --> 02:18:44.710]  Yeah, you can pre-order the book, but can you wait for this documentary right now?
[02:18:45.070 --> 02:18:48.372]  Be sure to check that out over at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:18:49.732 --> 02:18:51.093]  And we are back.
[02:18:51.133 --> 02:18:53.294]  We're talking about the Bohemian Grove.
[02:18:53.374 --> 02:19:08.992]   For those that are not familiar with the Grove, this is an encampment In Sonoma, California, it's been around for over a century, started in the late 1800s by a bunch of bohemian artisans.
[02:19:09.832 --> 02:19:16.595]  And as the establishment started to move in to the coastline, they started to take it over.
[02:19:17.015 --> 02:19:26.359]  And originally there were about 800 members, now it's a little over 3,000, but it has been extremely, extremely influential.
[02:19:28.423 --> 02:19:35.507]  In what we know today, and again, the modern day deep state in its secrecy models.
[02:19:36.107 --> 02:19:37.968]  You know, they pledged their allegiance to this.
[02:19:37.988 --> 02:19:53.972]   We're going to show you a clip from my film, Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined, where you understand that these people start these things as young men in college via Skull and Bones type secret societies, right?
[02:19:54.012 --> 02:19:58.075]  And that's where the occult rituals come in and their allegiance does.
[02:19:58.516 --> 02:20:08.865]  And that's actually post-World War II, and I want people to understand this, where they make the Central Intelligence Agency, where that is born.
[02:20:09.645 --> 02:20:19.447]   And then these guys are constantly jockeying for the black programs born classified at black sites like Area 51 and others.
[02:20:19.487 --> 02:20:50.982]   We're going to cover all that, but first let's get to George T. Bromley and the long ago and the later on his own book because historically here what you're looking at on one side are some of the plays and then you get to see the druidic in front of a Buddha and Bromley sitting in the middle himself Rituals that take place and When you look at this book here again, everything is dedicated to the Bohemian Club.
[02:20:51.002 --> 02:20:56.683]   Let's get right up to it Okay, everything is dedicated to the Bohemian Club.
[02:20:56.723 --> 02:20:58.345]  This was a huge part of his life.
[02:20:58.705 --> 02:21:04.910]  Throughout these chapters, not only does he tell you how he gets involved, and again, that meeting with Rockefeller right here.
[02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:12.917]  Mr. Rockefeller, unhesitantly, pronounced him the best man, this is one of his good friends that he went to school with, he had ever met.
[02:21:13.197 --> 02:21:20.043]  And this is also a man that died worth $5 million after investing, I believe it was, what was it, $25,000?
[02:21:21.884 --> 02:21:22.745]  With Rockefeller?
[02:21:23.065 --> 02:21:26.427]  It's good to know John D. Rockefeller and be in business with him.
[02:21:27.088 --> 02:21:27.448]  Alright?
[02:21:27.928 --> 02:21:38.956]  So they discuss right here how the High Priest of Bohemia, and that is George Bromley, initiates people into the club.
[02:21:39.836 --> 02:21:40.597]  And who is this?
[02:21:41.097 --> 02:21:42.438]  Is this Sir Henry Irving?
[02:21:42.458 --> 02:21:43.859]  Yes, Henry Irving.
[02:21:44.279 --> 02:21:45.660]  And this is his initiation.
[02:21:46.180 --> 02:21:49.022]  So the High Priest says, what is his object?
[02:21:49.423 --> 02:21:49.863]  The Cardinal.
[02:21:50.416 --> 02:21:53.299]  He desires to know what this is all about.
[02:21:53.940 --> 02:21:54.781]  Let him enter!
[02:21:55.682 --> 02:21:58.184]  Most excellent Cardinal, whom have you here?
[02:21:58.224 --> 02:22:00.046]  A stranger from a strange land.
[02:22:00.326 --> 02:22:05.672]  And I know this is a lot of goofy stuff to people, but this is how they do it.
[02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:09.503]  He has passed the ordeal of the election committee.
[02:22:09.523 --> 02:22:11.404]  In other words, they've nominated him.
[02:22:12.185 --> 02:22:18.371]  He has, without one feather dropping, then bring forth the paraphernalia and the sound, the gong.
[02:22:18.832 --> 02:22:21.334]  The owl, because that is their deity, folks.
[02:22:21.875 --> 02:22:26.239]  Okay, the cremation of care ritual, which we're going to read his own account of.
[02:22:27.584 --> 02:22:39.873]  Is a mollick type ball ritual where they burn the effigy of a body, but that symbolizes their soul, their very morality, their consciousness.
[02:22:40.093 --> 02:22:45.517]  You know, they might feel bad for some of the things they've done over the last year on behalf of this agenda.
[02:22:46.354 --> 02:22:49.196]  And this is very occult, and I'm going to go into the artwork one.
[02:22:49.636 --> 02:22:52.778]  But you can tell, again, I'm no Bible thumper.
[02:22:53.139 --> 02:22:53.919]  I'm no Christian.
[02:22:54.299 --> 02:22:54.580]  Okay?
[02:22:54.780 --> 02:22:55.580]  By any means.
[02:22:56.121 --> 02:23:01.424]  But, they have a very anti-Christian, pro-pagan, pro-occult attitude.
[02:23:01.805 --> 02:23:02.745]  High priest and all.
[02:23:03.225 --> 02:23:03.486]  Alright?
[02:23:03.526 --> 02:23:04.867]  And these are the deals.
[02:23:05.567 --> 02:23:06.828]  The owl and the loving cup.
[02:23:07.438 --> 02:23:13.740]  Resting upon a small table, were then placed before the candidate, and he was thus addressed by the high priest.
[02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:15.641]  Again, the owl is their deity.
[02:23:15.721 --> 02:23:17.582]  I will show this in their own annals.
[02:23:17.962 --> 02:23:24.644]  Illustrious neophyte, before you are permitted to know what this is all about, you will truly answer the question I am about to propound.
[02:23:26.167 --> 02:23:31.892]  But, as your future happiness may be affected by any mistake in your answer, I will reply to it for you.
[02:23:32.212 --> 02:23:52.010]  The answer being satisfactory, the candidate was requested to prepare himself for the obligation by taking the loving cup in his right hand and placing it in his left hand, uh, his left hand in his trousers pocket as the act of, uh, paying for the drink being given to understand that was a far as true bohemian ever got to paying for anything.
[02:23:52.470 --> 02:23:54.760]   In other words, Your money's no good here.
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:55.901]  We want your allegiance.
[02:23:56.641 --> 02:23:57.501]  That's what we want.
[02:23:57.661 --> 02:23:58.761]  We want your secrecy.
[02:24:01.082 --> 02:24:28.198]   In this presence of the owl and this July and August body, see, end of July, early August, again, Bohemian Club meeting now, now, and no one's reporting on it, I hereby pledge my word in this Bohemian toddy that I will ever cherish with feelings of delight The high old initiation I am passing through tonight nor will tell what hath been told me for friendship nor for Pell.
[02:24:29.079 --> 02:24:33.521]  Except it to be to someone who knows how it is himself.
[02:24:33.902 --> 02:24:39.265]  To the rules and regulations I will rigidly adhere by always drinking champagne in preference to beer.
[02:24:39.285 --> 02:24:45.349]  In other words, I'm going to shut my mouth and I only talk about this thing with other Bohemian Grove members.
[02:24:46.039 --> 02:24:51.783]  I will love each true bohemian, where on earth he goes, till he turns up to the daisies his emaciated toes.
[02:24:52.063 --> 02:24:53.264]  Till death I pledge this.
[02:24:54.224 --> 02:25:02.870]  As this, I truly promise, on the honor of my name, and I will do my level best to keep and perform the same, should I ever divulge the secrets I'm permitted here to know.
[02:25:03.350 --> 02:25:06.692]  May the wind blow through my whiskers, when they're allowed to grow.
[02:25:06.832 --> 02:25:08.153]  So once again, shut your mouth.
[02:25:11.095 --> 02:25:12.015]  The cremation of care.
[02:25:12.515 --> 02:25:12.836]  Okay?
[02:25:12.896 --> 02:25:18.977]  I know it's a little blown out there for the audience, but let's read from this, and this is what Bromley says about this.
[02:25:19.358 --> 02:25:19.758]  Alright?
[02:25:20.518 --> 02:25:29.701]  At the close of the hijinks, the ceremony of the cremation of care is solemnized, and it is not easy to conceive of a more solemn ceremony.
[02:25:30.381 --> 02:25:39.000]   On the top of the hill, in the rear of the hijink stage, are gathered those who do the participate in the cremation, and when the sire Declares the hijinks closed.
[02:25:39.020 --> 02:25:43.722]  He requests the audience to remain seated and the signal is given for the procession to move.
[02:25:44.182 --> 02:25:48.124]  The band playing the Dead March, it's all based in death.
[02:25:48.724 --> 02:25:52.466]  Again, look at Skull and Bones, look at their rituals on tape.
[02:25:52.486 --> 02:25:53.286]  We're going to play that.
[02:25:53.366 --> 02:25:54.327]  The devil equals death.
[02:25:54.707 --> 02:25:55.668]  Death equals the devil.
[02:25:57.969 --> 02:26:05.672]  The band playing the Dead March is followed by the high priest, that's Bromley, and the bearers of the casket containing the remains of care.
[02:26:05.852 --> 02:26:06.953]  Again, their consciousness.
[02:26:07.757 --> 02:26:12.231]  Then comes the procession bearing torches as they descend in the windway pathway.
[02:26:13.575 --> 02:26:18.317]  Lighted by varied colors, it is certainly one of the most solemn sights ever witnessed.
[02:26:18.757 --> 02:26:23.058]  For nowhere else could be seen such magnificent surroundings.
[02:26:23.218 --> 02:26:30.940]  As the procession passes, the audience, they all fall in and proceed to the ravine where the funeral pyre has been erected.
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:42.684]  And after marching twice around the pyre, the casket is then deposited thereon, the band plays a dirge, and the master of ceremonies delivers a short funeral oration.
[02:26:43.204 --> 02:26:52.481]  Then comes the High Priest with his address, closing with the soul-stirring announcement that Karkincare is conquered and Bohemia is free.
[02:26:52.942 --> 02:26:54.164]  Then come the Torchbearers.
[02:26:55.037 --> 02:26:59.080]  To apply their torches as soon as the whole... I can't even tell you what that is.
[02:26:59.380 --> 02:27:00.701]  Whatever it is, it's a blaze.
[02:27:01.281 --> 02:27:13.029]  And as the burning blocks fall asunder, the fireworks in the casket then burst forth, and a magnificent display of rockets, bombs, and Roman candles brilliantly light up the ravine and all of its surroundings.
[02:27:13.569 --> 02:27:13.870]  Okay?
[02:27:14.190 --> 02:27:15.751]  This is what Alex Jones captured.
[02:27:16.374 --> 02:27:18.255]  So, here he talks about this.
[02:27:18.776 --> 02:27:21.537]  So, again, there's more of an occult aspect.
[02:27:21.577 --> 02:27:22.638]  And why do they choose the owl?
[02:27:22.678 --> 02:27:24.459]  Because the owl is a predator.
[02:27:24.579 --> 02:27:26.520]  It can see in the night time.
[02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:31.123]  It represents death and destruction in the Mesoamerican culture.
[02:27:31.423 --> 02:27:33.124]  Weaving spiders come not here.
[02:27:33.565 --> 02:27:34.465]  Don't try to screw us.
[02:27:35.386 --> 02:27:44.351]  Among the midsummer hijinks at which I have officiated as high priest, again, I'm the high priest, were several upon which I should love to dilate.
[02:27:44.391 --> 02:27:45.072]  The Buddha jinx.
[02:27:45.894 --> 02:27:48.476]  Held in the Redwoods, back of Mount Timalapis.
[02:27:49.036 --> 02:27:52.578]  And sired by the late Fred M. Summers, the Druid Jinx!
[02:27:53.359 --> 02:27:53.719]  J.D.
[02:27:53.799 --> 02:27:58.802]  Redding, Aztec Jinx, and the High Madrid Jinx.
[02:27:59.262 --> 02:28:05.346]  So again, it's more than just this cremation of care ceremony.
[02:28:05.706 --> 02:28:06.006]  Okay?
[02:28:06.567 --> 02:28:08.808]  And I'm gonna show you some of the plays they do.
[02:28:08.868 --> 02:28:09.588]  They do Noah.
[02:28:10.209 --> 02:28:11.870]  There's a lot to this.
[02:28:12.631 --> 02:28:25.417]  But the important thing is that it is geopolitically relevant, and many of these people are bringing in the transhumanist, one-world, New World Order, Great Reset agenda.
[02:28:25.437 --> 02:28:26.658]  You know who's fighting that agenda?
[02:28:27.058 --> 02:28:31.060]  Alex Jones' every day at InfoWars.com.
[02:28:31.340 --> 02:28:36.963]  So now's the time to go to InfoWarsStore.com, make that donation or purchase, and what?

[02:28:48.427 --> 02:28:55.628]  The information that InfoWars is covering is literally the blueprint to counter their great reset with a great awakening.
[02:28:56.428 --> 02:29:00.589]  When you support InfoWars by getting great products, you keep the tip of the spear on the air.
[02:29:00.969 --> 02:29:13.331]  You see the enemy hates us probably more than even Trump because we are identifying who they are and what incredible psychotic control freaks they are and how humanity can be awakened to defeat them.
[02:29:14.171 --> 02:29:22.316]  Right now, we're doing a major fundraiser to fund our legal bills and to fund things into the future and to make sure we get stronger, not weaker.

[02:29:56.357 --> 02:29:57.157]  It's amazing for that.
[02:29:57.637 --> 02:29:58.358]  Diet force.

[02:30:40.513 --> 02:30:50.432]  please take action. So we are back on...
[02:30:48.392 --> 02:30:49.233]  I am Jason Burmess.
[02:30:49.253 --> 02:30:58.837]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, and we've been going through different annals and aspects of the Bohemian Club and Grove.
[02:30:58.877 --> 02:31:05.639]  The Grove right now meeting in Sonoma, California last week of July, first week of August.
[02:31:05.739 --> 02:31:11.002]   And again, big things get decided At the Grove!
[02:31:11.402 --> 02:31:22.149]  And when you have the Central Intelligence Agency running operations against their own politicians, many of them members, do you think any of the blackmail might be discussed?
[02:31:22.390 --> 02:31:25.932]  Do you think any of the arms deals might be discussed?
[02:31:26.873 --> 02:31:27.453]  I don't know!
[02:31:28.174 --> 02:31:33.537]  Sure seems that way, especially when you have some of the biggest players out there.
[02:31:33.877 --> 02:31:38.721]  And for some reason, they're into this weird owl deity.
[02:31:39.614 --> 02:31:44.475]  I want to show people here, I believe this one isn't quite a hundred years old, although I have one a little over.
[02:31:44.695 --> 02:31:46.555]  The Annals of the Bohemian Club.
[02:31:47.056 --> 02:31:50.916]  Okay, and it's to their tutelary owl deity.
[02:31:51.356 --> 02:31:54.417]  You can see the owl right here.
[02:31:55.257 --> 02:31:57.938]  Okay, and where is it right here?
[02:31:58.458 --> 02:32:02.079]  There it is, the tutelary deity, the owl.
[02:32:02.779 --> 02:32:08.000]  Alright, and in this you can actually see Bromley in cartoon form.
[02:32:08.760 --> 02:32:16.484]  And here he is, in his little boat in the corner, the owl boat riding across, and in his high priest outfit.
[02:32:17.244 --> 02:32:27.309]  And don't forget, this whole occult and technology thing, think about Jack Parsons, think about rockets, think about the Nazis themselves being in to the occult.
[02:32:27.469 --> 02:32:28.209]  There's Bromley.
[02:32:28.870 --> 02:32:32.071]  It all has historical precedence.
[02:32:32.531 --> 02:32:39.539]   And when we look at this annal here, and this is the eighth annal, this is focusing on the artwork, of Bohemia.
[02:32:40.040 --> 02:32:43.505]  You see and hear those themes again and again.
[02:32:44.166 --> 02:32:46.911]  And they start talking about a guy named Hague Padigan.
[02:32:46.971 --> 02:32:50.396]  He's the one that constructed the owl.
[02:32:50.797 --> 02:32:50.917]  Okay?
[02:32:50.937 --> 02:32:52.920]  Let's get to that right here.
[02:32:53.746 --> 02:33:02.208]  Okay, three-time club president, Hegg Patagon, among the best known of Bohemian Artigas, Patagon was one of the West Coast's most prominent sculptors.
[02:33:02.669 --> 02:33:08.550]  His Owl Shrine at the Grove stands as one of the most defining images of Bohemia.
[02:33:08.970 --> 02:33:11.231]  It is indeed their shrine.
[02:33:11.937 --> 02:33:27.122]  And in this, again, they talk about another artist, Robert Henri, and I want to read this, because I was trying to find this painting, if anybody can find it, I'd love to see it, whose urban realism and aesthetic flexibility he inherited and transported to California.
[02:33:27.202 --> 02:33:40.226]  Especially interesting for a bohemian artist was a 1914 painting entitled Greed, in which a naked family hung from a cross representing industrial avarice.
[02:33:41.007 --> 02:33:45.710]  They love that anti-Christian, anti-family stuff, even in 1914.
[02:33:46.550 --> 02:33:52.994]  And I'm going to read a quote from Jack London, of Call of the Wild, what he had to say about the artists that hung with these people.
[02:33:53.334 --> 02:33:57.937]  Because if you're a low-level minion, you know, Clint Eastwood likes to go there, he's part of the club.
[02:33:58.697 --> 02:34:13.472]   If you were, say, Willie Brown, mayor of San Francisco, you might want to be a part of this, because You get a low-key warning on the morning of 9-11 not to fly that day, and then you can, you know, years later deny it ever happened on camera.
[02:34:14.233 --> 02:34:15.976]  You know, it has its perks.
[02:34:16.576 --> 02:34:17.478]  Bohemian Club.
[02:34:18.038 --> 02:34:19.520]  And let me read this right here.
[02:34:19.580 --> 02:34:20.682]  This is from Jack London.
[02:34:21.437 --> 02:34:27.502]  This brings to mind none other than Jack London and his ambivalent views about the club and modern society.
[02:34:27.542 --> 02:34:35.788]  He expressed conflicting values and attachments that earlier Bohemian figures seem to be able to hold simultaneously.
[02:34:36.448 --> 02:34:43.233]  Perhaps the most famous Bohemian of all, London had written in 1907, even then, he saw where this was going.
[02:34:43.273 --> 02:34:48.277]  Remember, late 1800s, mostly artisans, and then started getting taken over.
[02:34:48.757 --> 02:34:52.677]   That Bromley book, I mean, you look at when he joins, same thing.
[02:34:53.818 --> 02:35:01.862]  As for the artists, they merely pander to the little less than ignoble taste of the plutocracy.
[02:35:02.602 --> 02:35:02.903]  Huh.
[02:35:03.823 --> 02:35:04.844]  The plutocracy.
[02:35:05.664 --> 02:35:09.746]  And if you don't know what plutocrats are, they keep getting richer and you keep getting poorer.
[02:35:09.766 --> 02:35:11.587]  It's like the definition.
[02:35:12.007 --> 02:35:13.148]  It's like the oligarchy.
[02:35:14.028 --> 02:35:17.410]  Alright, so even then, even then he was aware.
[02:35:18.151 --> 02:35:18.651]  Let's see.
[02:35:19.577 --> 02:35:25.101]  I want to show you just a couple of the things in the artwork, and then we're going to get into the military-industrial complex aspect of this.
[02:35:25.361 --> 02:35:27.822]  This looks like something right out of Eyes Wide Shut.
[02:35:28.343 --> 02:35:29.604]  You want to go to the Christmas dinner?
[02:35:29.624 --> 02:35:30.904]  That looks great.
[02:35:31.545 --> 02:35:32.285]  That looks fun.
[02:35:33.226 --> 02:35:34.567]  And let's see here.
[02:35:35.508 --> 02:35:36.328]  Here they do Noah.
[02:35:36.748 --> 02:35:38.489]  You know, they do a lot of these plays.
[02:35:38.890 --> 02:35:40.271]  By the way, no women.
[02:35:41.171 --> 02:35:42.712]  So the men play the women.
[02:35:42.732 --> 02:35:44.553]  A lot of them dress in drag.
[02:35:45.434 --> 02:35:51.722]   A lot of them were, and have been, Closeted homosexuals that have been compromised.
[02:35:51.962 --> 02:35:55.404]  People like Dennis Hassert, who's far worse.
[02:35:55.785 --> 02:35:59.247]  And I'm not saying that homosexuality is bad here.
[02:35:59.727 --> 02:36:06.692]  I'm saying that you get compromised when you're running on the conservative party and you say you're a Christian conservative and you have a family.
[02:36:07.072 --> 02:36:09.194]  Dennis, of course, did all those things.
[02:36:09.614 --> 02:36:15.358]  But, in fact, he was labeled as a serial child molester by a judge.
[02:36:16.419 --> 02:36:16.999]  No big deal.
[02:36:17.839 --> 02:36:20.680]  You know, he never did any time for that either.
[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:23.041]  That's not a big deal either, right?
[02:36:23.061 --> 02:36:28.784]  He just did 15 months and he's an old man in a wheelchair, free today.
[02:36:29.544 --> 02:36:31.345]  And all of these things integrate.
[02:36:31.365 --> 02:36:39.088]  And that's why when we come back, we're going to play a segment from Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined.
[02:36:39.588 --> 02:36:48.875]   But we're going to start with some of the biometrics Some of the technology that's emerging on a large scale now before we get into the Grove.
[02:36:48.955 --> 02:36:49.256]  Why?
[02:36:49.958 --> 02:36:52.559]  Because it all integrates together.
[02:36:52.579 --> 02:36:57.561]  We're going to work in Tom Cruise, Lockheed Martin, and much, much more.
[02:36:58.181 --> 02:37:01.782]  Skunk Works, the Oxcart Program, you better believe it.
[02:37:02.243 --> 02:37:05.204]  So much information here at InfoWars.com.
[02:37:05.484 --> 02:37:07.504]  You're not going to find anywhere else.
[02:37:07.865 --> 02:37:14.927]  So now's the time to hit InfoWarsStore.com, make that purchase, make that donation, support Alex Jones.
[02:37:15.207 --> 02:37:16.888]  We'll see you on the flip side of these commercials.
[02:37:18.283 --> 02:37:18.824]  We are back.
[02:37:18.924 --> 02:37:19.744]  I am Jason Bermas.
[02:37:19.764 --> 02:37:22.006]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:22.026 --> 02:37:24.508]  We're talking Bohemian Grove.
[02:37:24.608 --> 02:37:25.729]  It's going on right now.
[02:37:25.809 --> 02:37:26.770]  Nobody's writing about it.
[02:37:26.830 --> 02:37:35.978]  I'd love to see what the list looked like there over the last week and a half or so into the end of this week or what they're discussing.
[02:37:36.438 --> 02:37:43.004]  Because when you look at this book right here, The Greatest Men's Party on Earth, it's by John Van Der Zee.
[02:37:43.044 --> 02:37:44.125]  It's kind of tough to get.
[02:37:44.725 --> 02:37:46.307]  And he was actually allowed in.
[02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:49.942]  And let me just read, this is basically from the beginning of the prologue.
[02:37:50.442 --> 02:37:55.725]  Why have the paths of American men as seemingly diverse as Dwight Eisenhower and Bobby Kennedy?
[02:37:56.334 --> 02:38:03.917]  Pat Brown and Richard Nixon, Earl Warren and Barry Goldwater all passed through this one out-of-the-way woods.
[02:38:04.517 --> 02:38:11.219]  What is it that has made the Bohemian Grove one of the places that the man who has arrived in America arrives at?
[02:38:11.599 --> 02:38:16.841]  Most important, what needs and desires common to us all does the Grove represent?
[02:38:17.541 --> 02:38:18.002]  Power?
[02:38:18.782 --> 02:38:19.542]  Secrecy?
[02:38:20.022 --> 02:38:22.363]  Maybe the desire to help rule the world?
[02:38:22.563 --> 02:38:23.003]  I don't know!
[02:38:23.023 --> 02:38:24.524]  I don't know.
[02:38:25.228 --> 02:38:30.111]  But again, this is a good read and it shows that power structure and how diverse it is.
[02:38:30.871 --> 02:38:42.838]  And this is where I want to get to Dwight D. Eisenhower and the modern-day military-industrial complex that, again, was really born out of that model and the technology.
[02:38:42.879 --> 02:38:52.864]  Because we live in a world now, okay, where cloned beagles are being created and gene-edited.
[02:38:53.425 --> 02:38:58.463]   Now, In the 90s, we openly had the cloning of Dolly.
[02:38:58.904 --> 02:39:05.315]  Livestock has been cloned for years, if not over a decade publicly in this country alone.
[02:39:05.355 --> 02:39:06.016]  But now...
[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:12.844]  It's being normalized that CRISPR tools can be used to mess with life.
[02:39:13.064 --> 02:39:18.548]  Also, we live in a world where not only black helicopters now exist.
[02:39:18.568 --> 02:39:20.369]  Remember black helicopters in the United States?
[02:39:20.629 --> 02:39:21.630]  That's hooey!
[02:39:22.110 --> 02:39:27.414]  But now they're being controlled remotely after being retrofitted by DARPA.
[02:39:28.777 --> 02:39:31.761]  Yes, the Black Hawk helicopters have now become drones.
[02:39:31.881 --> 02:39:34.684]  Those are the worlds... I mean, this is the world we live in.
[02:39:34.724 --> 02:39:39.850]  They're rolling out technology they've had for a very, very long time.
[02:39:40.851 --> 02:39:42.974]  And most of this technology...
[02:39:43.829 --> 02:39:46.010]  has been beta tested one way or another.
[02:39:46.150 --> 02:39:58.773]  Area 51, Operation Paperclip, The Pentagon's Brain, and especially First Platoon, because we're going to be going over how the biometrics that we're seeing across the world were really beta tested during the War on Terror.
[02:39:59.154 --> 02:40:01.014]  We're going to lead into that through the fear of 9-11.
[02:40:01.034 --> 02:40:02.295]  Remember that?
[02:40:03.575 --> 02:40:10.457]  So, these books that you're looking at, to me, are a must-read history lesson.
[02:40:11.369 --> 02:40:23.973]  On how the Continuity of Government Program, born classified in the military-industrial complex, got out of control and is what was warned about by Eisenhower himself.
[02:40:24.653 --> 02:40:30.255]  So, let's take it back a step to Area 51 and the Oxcart Program.
[02:40:32.043 --> 02:40:43.647]  One of the things I actually liked about Top Gun Maverick is, spoiler alert, like the very first scene for the very first plane that he's going to be testing was an ode to the Oxcart program.
[02:40:44.027 --> 02:40:46.548]  It had the Skunk Works logo on the back.
[02:40:46.608 --> 02:40:49.769]  It said Lockheed Martin on the shift stick.
[02:40:50.629 --> 02:41:04.358]  Okay, and Tom Cruise had to do lengthy exercises and breathings and be in chambers just to fly the aircraft as documented, once again, in Annie Jacobson's Area 51.
[02:41:05.439 --> 02:41:11.122]  Then she gets interested in the fact that, wait a minute, a lot of these people were involved in the military-industrial complex and things like that?
[02:41:11.983 --> 02:41:13.204]  Yeah, it's weird.
[02:41:13.464 --> 02:41:14.504]  They were Nazis.
[02:41:15.705 --> 02:41:25.316]   And then the Good Shepherd Hollywoodizes The fact that Skull and Bones comes out of the OSS into the CIA.
[02:41:26.676 --> 02:41:26.937]  Right?
[02:41:27.197 --> 02:41:27.737]  Whole thing.
[02:41:27.757 --> 02:41:31.879]  And they do the occult rituals, and they dress in drag, and that's the model.
[02:41:32.279 --> 02:41:33.480]  That's why it's important.
[02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:35.381]  That's why it's important.
[02:41:35.821 --> 02:41:39.843]  So, let's play some of this right here and talk about some of that technology.
[02:41:40.589 --> 02:41:44.514]  In my mind, one day you're on one side of the ledger, the other day you may be on the other side of the ledger.
[02:41:44.975 --> 02:41:56.690]  Biometrics have been instituted in both Afghanistan and Iraq, where individuals are subject to fingerprint devices, iris scanners, and electronic databases to screen local residents, as well as DNA tests.
[02:41:57.631 --> 02:41:58.873]  Does this sound familiar, by the way?
[02:41:59.958 --> 02:42:07.721]  Again, we do this under the guise of the War on Terror because we were exploited by a thing called CNN Syndrome, which I'll show you in a minute.
[02:42:08.161 --> 02:42:09.562]  And now it's coming everywhere!
[02:42:09.582 --> 02:42:12.823]  This includes anyone within the populace of a combat zone.
[02:42:13.083 --> 02:42:22.667]  Someone has to go out there with the biometric registration equipment, take your iris scans, take your scans, and get you registered in the system like that.
[02:42:23.387 --> 02:42:29.750]   As scary and tyrannical as these systems seem to be, None may be as dangerous as the implantable RFID microchip.
[02:42:30.630 --> 02:42:37.792]  Through various pretenses, including terror, security, and entertainment, the chip has been promoted and integrated into society.
[02:42:39.053 --> 02:42:47.215]  In 2001, following the 9-11 terrorist attacks, the Jacobs family became the first family to be injected with microchips in front of a live television audience.
[02:42:47.853 --> 02:42:52.216]  We have a Florida family who are really pioneers in a brave new world.
[02:42:52.456 --> 02:43:00.002]  They have volunteered to be the first ever to have microchip identification devices implanted into their body.
[02:43:00.202 --> 02:43:04.224]  After 9-11, I was really concerned with the security of my family.
[02:43:04.665 --> 02:43:10.169]  In 2004, the FDA approved the use of RFID technology to be implanted into human beings.
[02:43:11.089 --> 02:43:16.293]  However, studies dating back to the 1990s show the implantable microchip has been linked to cancer in animals.
[02:43:16.917 --> 02:43:18.919]  But this has not slowed the agenda of control.
[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:25.445]  In Barcelona, trendies get chips in order to receive VIP status at the exclusive Baja nightclub.
[02:43:26.046 --> 02:43:29.929]  A simple swipe of the arm get them in without a line, and it pays for their drinks, too.
[02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:33.873]  The Mexican government also chipped employees for security measures in 2004.
[02:43:35.487 --> 02:43:42.930]  We were interested today to hear that more than 100 law enforcement officials in Mexico are having microchips implanted in their arms.
[02:43:42.990 --> 02:43:46.912]  The chips allow a person to be scanned, sort of like a cereal box at the supermarket checkout.
[02:43:47.392 --> 02:43:53.055]  Mexico's Attorney General and 160 of his deputies have had microchips implanted in their arms.
[02:43:54.315 --> 02:43:59.658]  It is to provide access, said the Attorney General, to the right people in exclusive areas.
[02:43:59.878 --> 02:44:08.516]   Today, aside from being promoted as a device that can save your life by storing all of your medical information in it, It is being promoted as the next generation tool for video gaming.
[02:44:09.598 --> 02:44:14.765]  Sega developer Yu Suzuki plans on developing gaming technology using implantable RFIDs.
[02:44:15.345 --> 02:44:20.472]  He states, people that have some sort of chips in their bodies to be able to keep track of vital signs.
[02:44:20.813 --> 02:44:25.253]   So it doesn't have to be a scary thing, but you could put a sensor here, you know, a bit
[02:44:25.253 --> 02:44:27.992]  like the Matrix, as he points to his arm.
[02:44:27.992 --> 02:44:30.052]  It's not really something only in the future.
[02:44:30.052 --> 02:44:32.813]  Some people already have them, chips in their bodies.
[02:44:32.813 --> 02:44:33.813]  Suzuki is correct.
[02:44:33.813 --> 02:44:39.132]   It has never been easier to order a microchip online and implant it under your skin.
[02:44:39.132 --> 02:44:42.772]   Microchips implanted in your hand, arm, or shoulder is just the beginning.
[02:44:42.772 --> 02:44:47.253]   Some have already taken implantable brain chips that may enable the blind to see again,
[02:44:47.253 --> 02:44:52.292]   the deaf to hear, and much, much more, including the ability to download information directly
[02:44:52.292 --> 02:44:56.692]   into the brain and instantly communicate with anyone in the world, creating a worldwide
[02:44:57.539 --> 02:44:58.779]  It's very interesting.
[02:44:59.299 --> 02:45:08.802]  So, I just want to point out, this film is from 2010, and how much of that has been mainlined and streamlined, and really the VeraChip type model is like a toy.
[02:45:09.143 --> 02:45:10.483]  And we're talking about Neuralink.
[02:45:11.013 --> 02:45:23.359]  We have Dennis Bushnell, the author of that future strategic warfare document that I continually go back to, because it is so important, so important for people to understand how real this is.
[02:45:23.919 --> 02:45:34.945]  Back in 2001, again talking about what, CNN syndrome, so that they could basically exploit the casualties of people for this same agenda.
[02:45:35.501 --> 02:45:42.390]  Sound like the COVID-19-84 nightmare when they talk about things that will monitor your very bodily autonomy?
[02:45:43.011 --> 02:45:44.753]  All of your vitals all the time?
[02:45:46.095 --> 02:45:48.278]  Bionanotech is here.
[02:45:48.458 --> 02:45:50.641]  It's not going anywhere.
[02:45:51.382 --> 02:45:52.824]  In this, they also talk about what?
[02:45:54.329 --> 02:45:54.729]  Oh yeah.
[02:45:55.109 --> 02:45:57.851]  Capturing and torturing Americans in living color on prime time.
[02:45:58.071 --> 02:46:00.472]  Terror attacks within the continental United States.
[02:46:00.572 --> 02:46:03.973]  Binary, biological, critical infrastructure takedowns.
[02:46:04.494 --> 02:46:05.514]  Cyber attack anybody?
[02:46:05.694 --> 02:46:07.835]  This document is from July of 2001.
[02:46:11.957 --> 02:46:20.341]  These are the type of things, again, that are promoted by these people that are at the very top through compartmentalization.
[02:46:20.561 --> 02:46:27.175]   Through the military-industrial complex, we were warned about By Eisenhower, that was a spiritual battle.
[02:46:27.496 --> 02:46:31.945]  So when we come back, we're going to get to the secret societies and the grove.
[02:46:32.006 --> 02:46:34.210]  It's Invisible Empire was produced here.
[02:46:35.083 --> 02:46:38.384]  at InfoWars.com over a decade ago.
[02:46:38.524 --> 02:46:39.584]  All of my films are free.
[02:46:39.624 --> 02:46:43.166]  Loose Change, Final Cut, Fabled Enemies, Invisible Empire, and Shade.
[02:46:43.226 --> 02:46:44.006]  Share them with others.
[02:46:44.366 --> 02:46:46.327]  Alex Jones says the same thing.
[02:46:46.367 --> 02:46:50.428]  That's why you need to go to InfoWars.com right now.
[02:46:50.868 --> 02:46:55.409]  Make the purchase, make the donation, and get the word out.
[02:46:55.589 --> 02:47:00.691]  Now is the time, if you have not, to get on the ground and join the InfoWars.
[02:47:04.818 --> 02:47:15.286]  I gotta tell you, this book, The Great Reset and The War for the World, the left and the mainstream media are going to have to sit there, and we've got to force them to respond to this book.
[02:47:16.087 --> 02:47:17.768]  This book is that important.
[02:47:17.808 --> 02:47:19.729]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter.
[02:47:20.110 --> 02:47:33.559]   If you compare the finest, and I'm telling you, you take MIT Technology Review, you take Science, take all these magazines and journals, add the electronic part of it, and, you know, NPR, PBS, all of it, I'll take it.
[02:47:33.839 --> 02:47:40.861]  I'll match up and we'll go through and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there.
[02:47:41.102 --> 02:47:45.183]  And if you're a sentient human being and just watching it, you say, well, God, Alex Jones was ahead of this.
[02:47:45.223 --> 02:47:46.423]  Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[02:47:46.483 --> 02:47:48.744]  They're just in this huge revolution.
[02:47:49.304 --> 02:47:53.942]   against choice and free will and normal technological development
[02:47:53.942 --> 02:47:56.943]  and adoption of technology that empowers humanity.
[02:47:56.943 --> 02:48:04.263]   Instead, they want adoption of technology, forced adoption, world IDs, global social credit scores, carbon taxes
[02:48:04.263 --> 02:48:07.384]  that dominate and monitor every facet of our lives.
[02:48:07.384 --> 02:48:11.584]   You make the case of what the not just the new world order is,
[02:48:11.584 --> 02:48:18.384]   but using this great reset to really take up their whole idea of control and authoritarianism.
[02:48:18.593 --> 02:48:27.835]  They have decided to trigger a controlled collapse and then bring in a new dark age to control the general public where they will be in their Elysium fields.
[02:48:28.095 --> 02:48:30.336]  There is no new technology coming in.
[02:48:30.376 --> 02:48:31.196]  They're blocking that.
[02:48:31.796 --> 02:48:37.818]  And so really, they're just imploding things under the Clough-Pippen model to show that they can get that control over us.
[02:48:38.198 --> 02:48:40.139]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter.
[02:48:40.199 --> 02:48:53.083]  He has presented tons of valid evidence and facts that I think have been really, really important to raising consciousness to what this sort of technocratic global elite really want to do.
[02:48:53.524 --> 02:49:02.547]   The true thing that you've done, which is stunning, If you look at the evidence of that and the facts, you are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:49:03.127 --> 02:49:04.028]  That is very rare.
[02:49:04.068 --> 02:49:07.669]  You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[02:49:08.509 --> 02:49:15.152]  This book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, I'm telling you, everybody in America, the people that hate Alex Jones the most have to read this book.
[02:49:15.732 --> 02:49:16.693]  This is no beach read.
[02:49:17.373 --> 02:49:18.574]  You're not going to be flipping pages here.
[02:49:18.594 --> 02:49:20.897]  You're going to be having a pen out and you're going to be underlining stuff.
[02:49:21.017 --> 02:49:21.798]  It's amazing.
[02:49:22.278 --> 02:49:26.362]  The Great Reset and the War for the World by Alex Jones.
[02:49:26.742 --> 02:49:31.107]  Available now on Amazon or InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:49:35.591 --> 02:49:36.272]  We are back.
[02:49:36.312 --> 02:49:38.033]  It's the final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:49:38.153 --> 02:49:49.218]   I am Jason Bermas and before we get back to this, Part in Invisible Empire, a new world order defined that discusses the Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones, and secret societies.
[02:49:49.238 --> 02:49:51.759]  A lot of people argue, Jason, they're just plays.
[02:49:52.239 --> 02:49:54.840]  These people are rooty-tooty good people!
[02:49:55.620 --> 02:49:56.580]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:49:57.361 --> 02:50:08.584]  Read the Franklin cover-up or the Franklin scandal, and one of the darkest accounts of what could happen to a child allegedly occurs at the Bohemian Grove.
[02:50:08.905 --> 02:50:14.129]   And it is worth noting Before we get into this segment, that what?
[02:50:15.070 --> 02:50:32.337]  The Daily Mail, of all places, earlier this week, did a extensive piece on the documentary Conspiracy of Silence, which was never released, okay, never released, and talked about the cowboys in the White House.
[02:50:32.717 --> 02:50:40.177]   Lawrence King, Peter Citron, victims, Elijah Kramer, I'm sorry, not Elijah Kramer.
[02:50:40.457 --> 02:50:41.718]  Alicia Owens, my bad.
[02:50:42.559 --> 02:50:46.862]  Troy Bonner, and of course, Paul Bonacci that gives that account.
[02:50:46.902 --> 02:50:49.744]  There's Bonacci and they show a picture of Citron here.
[02:50:50.264 --> 02:50:51.946]  I mean, again, the darkness.
[02:50:53.527 --> 02:51:01.971]  If you look at this information, the people that supposedly love us and rule over us, there's nothing benevolent about them.
[02:51:02.312 --> 02:51:09.595]  So let's kick off this clip on their secret societies, the Bohemian Grove, and their significance.
[02:51:13.017 --> 02:51:20.001]  Politicians, business leaders, and media figures are often portrayed as pillars of morality while they describe themselves as Christian conservatives.
[02:51:20.481 --> 02:51:21.862]  Nothing could be further from the truth.
[02:51:22.558 --> 02:51:26.939]  In reality, many of the elite are groomed at a young age to take part in occult rituals.
[02:51:27.499 --> 02:51:34.100]  Those who attend Yale are indoctrinated into the Order of Skull and Bones, an elite secret society cloaked as a fraternal order.
[02:51:34.640 --> 02:51:45.702]  Yale University is 300 years old this year, and were you to visit its campus, you would see that it still has exotic clubhouses, which look like tombs where Yale's legendary secret societies meet.
[02:51:46.842 --> 02:51:51.683]  Their prestige and importance have largely evaporated, but the rituals are still a secret.
[02:51:52.865 --> 02:52:00.987]  And so when we heard that some enterprising characters had managed to spy on the famous Skull and Bones Society, we couldn't resist.
[02:52:01.007 --> 02:52:04.789]  Skull and Bones, people say it's a fraternity.
[02:52:04.869 --> 02:52:05.529]  Pops the Reese.
[02:52:05.569 --> 02:52:06.029]  He'll mock you.
[02:52:06.049 --> 02:52:06.729]  Skip over the ice.
[02:52:07.369 --> 02:52:12.431]  Horrific screams caught on tape include chants of, the devil equals death, death equals the devil.
[02:52:15.390 --> 02:52:15.630]  True.
[02:52:16.131 --> 02:52:30.723]  Famous alums include Senators John Kerry and John Chafee, to name two, Cabinet Secretaries, such as Averill Harriman, and three Presidents, William Taft, George Bush, and George W. Bush, who's been reluctant to talk about skull and bones.
[02:52:30.963 --> 02:52:31.864]  Does it still exist?
[02:52:32.844 --> 02:52:35.606]  The thing is so secret that I'm not even sure it still exists.
[02:52:35.986 --> 02:52:43.371]  Former Skull and Bones members and current members have been presidents, heads of the CIA, senators, heads of business.
[02:52:43.431 --> 02:52:45.793]  I mean, huge, huge corporations.
[02:52:46.433 --> 02:52:52.277]  These people have the network that brings them to such a position of power that most people could only dream of.
[02:52:52.517 --> 02:52:55.839]  Bush would run against his fellow Bonesmen and distant cousin John Kerry in 2004.
[02:52:57.572 --> 02:53:00.815]  You both were members of Skull and Bones, a secret society at Yale.
[02:53:01.235 --> 02:53:01.896]  What does that tell us?
[02:53:02.676 --> 02:53:04.177]  Uh, not much because it's a secret.
[02:53:05.759 --> 02:53:06.780]  Is there a secret handshake?
[02:53:06.800 --> 02:53:07.820]  Is there a secret code?
[02:53:07.840 --> 02:53:11.463]  I wish there were something secret I could manifest.
[02:53:11.704 --> 02:53:12.524]  322, a secret number?
[02:53:12.544 --> 02:53:14.306]  There are all kinds of secrets, Tim.
[02:53:14.566 --> 02:53:16.988]  You were both in Skull and Bones, the secret society.
[02:53:18.089 --> 02:53:19.530]  It's so secret we can't talk about it.
[02:53:19.550 --> 02:53:20.631]  What does that mean for America?
[02:53:22.023 --> 02:53:24.544]  The conspiracy theorists are going to go wild.
[02:53:24.624 --> 02:53:25.005]  I don't know.
[02:53:25.045 --> 02:53:26.545]  I haven't seen the web.
[02:53:26.585 --> 02:53:29.187]  Number 322.
[02:53:29.387 --> 02:53:34.570]  You can bet, by the way, that George Bush is more than likely at the Grove.
[02:53:34.630 --> 02:53:36.551]  So let's get right to it.
[02:53:36.631 --> 02:53:37.611]  Here is the Grove.
[02:53:38.172 --> 02:53:39.492]  We're finally there, folks.
[02:53:40.193 --> 02:53:40.773]  Thumbs it up.
[02:53:41.391 --> 02:53:45.032]  Subscribe and share to everything I do outside of here.
[02:53:45.072 --> 02:53:49.014]  And by the way, we are fully demonetized on YouTube.
[02:53:49.034 --> 02:53:50.594]  We get kicked off all the time.
[02:53:50.694 --> 02:53:53.455]  Rockfin, Rumble, and Podbean is where you can find my stuff.
[02:53:53.715 --> 02:53:57.597]  Camp for the Powerful, an all-male gathering in great secrecy.
[02:53:58.057 --> 02:54:03.199]  This group was formed in the late 1800s by artists, industrialists, and politicians.
[02:54:04.025 --> 02:54:06.527]  Bohemian attendees worship the owl as their deity.
[02:54:06.947 --> 02:54:12.371]  The Aztecs, Mayans, and other natives of Mesoamerica consider the owl a symbol of destruction and death.
[02:54:13.112 --> 02:54:16.314]  This is why the opening ritual for the club is the cremation of care.
[02:54:16.794 --> 02:54:27.582]  During the ritual, the effigy of a baby is rowed across the water by the Grim Reaper and given to a high priest, who then tosses it on a fiery sacrificial altar of a 40-foot owl god.
[02:54:28.229 --> 02:54:31.151]  It is an Earth-based ritual in which care is burned away.
[02:54:31.571 --> 02:54:36.734]  The conscience is symbolically cast aside so that they may ignore the pain they have inflicted on others.
[02:54:37.295 --> 02:54:38.976]  The advancement of their own agendas.
[02:54:38.996 --> 02:54:52.564]  With this ceremony called the Cremation of Care that begins the two-week encampment where the body of dull care symbolizing woes and concerns is burned on an altar in front of a big owl statue.
[02:54:53.105 --> 02:54:56.207]  When that ceremony ends, they all start to cheer and yell.
[02:54:57.685 --> 02:54:59.987]  You have to ask yourself why.
[02:55:00.327 --> 02:55:06.132]  Why it is that somebody would want to do that, let alone these elite people.
[02:55:06.572 --> 02:55:08.093]  And that's a great question, Mark.
[02:55:08.434 --> 02:55:12.277]  Well, let me tell you in this last couple of minutes.
[02:55:13.519 --> 02:55:26.825]  Because these people at the top, many of which are generational sociopaths, are not like you and I. They look down upon us as commoners.
[02:55:27.406 --> 02:55:59.603]   And they see themselves as those that will drive the next evolution of humankind via veiled technology based on their systems of compartmentalization And achieve what they believe will be godhood as the rest of us that are allowed to survive are a new servant class that have been genetically changed
[02:56:00.820 --> 02:56:03.261]  And merged with machines.
[02:56:03.321 --> 02:56:13.743]  The idea that you or I or any of them will ever upload their consciousness into machines is a great lie.
[02:56:14.104 --> 02:56:29.455]   It is a great deception and it is a tool that they are using via their media and propaganda and entertainment to push Via their transgender, really trans-human movement.
[02:56:29.835 --> 02:56:32.196]  This is InfoWars.com.
[02:56:32.296 --> 02:56:37.139]  I want to thank Alex Jones for giving me the opportunity to do the fourth hour and discuss the Grove.
[02:56:37.459 --> 02:56:42.922]  Again, not one mention anywhere in the mainstream media this year about it.
[02:56:43.382 --> 02:56:44.883]  It is significant.
[02:56:45.629 --> 02:56:57.894]  Unfortunately, it appears very dark things go on there, aside from the occult rituals, again, that were caught on camera by Alex Jones over two decades ago.
[02:56:58.255 --> 02:57:04.397]  So, if you haven't done so yet, if you're new to the InfoWar, now is the time to support Alex Jones.
[02:57:04.417 --> 02:57:06.358]  Go to InfoWarStore.com.
[02:57:06.638 --> 02:57:08.239]  Get a copy of Alex's War.
[02:57:08.976 --> 02:57:12.580]  Pre-order the Great Reset book that they have done.
[02:57:12.620 --> 02:57:16.163]  And remember, all of my work is absolutely 100% free.
[02:57:16.183 --> 02:57:28.096]  I want you to check out Loose Change, Final Cut, Fabled Enemies, Invisible Empire, A New World Order to find all produced here for free, as well as Shade the Motion picture that Alex Jones appears in frequently.
[02:57:28.276 --> 02:57:28.656]  Love you guys.
[02:57:28.475 --> 02:57:48.395]   See you on the flip.
[02:57:49.110 --> 02:57:53.033]  We are now deciding the very future destiny of our species.
[02:57:53.273 --> 02:57:57.676]  And at the very forefront of that fight against the New World Order and their Great Reset is InfoWars.
[02:57:57.856 --> 02:58:06.203]  And it's you, the viewer and listener of this broadcast, that have paved the way for a real opposition to the New World Order that has a very good chance of defeating them.
[02:58:06.763 --> 02:58:08.425]  Even their own internal documents have leaked.
[02:58:08.954 --> 02:58:14.555]   where the top globalists admit they're losing their war for the world and their war to take
[02:58:14.555 --> 02:58:19.674]   over humanity. But still things are neck and neck and things are very very close. Ladies and
[02:58:19.674 --> 02:58:23.594]   gentlemen you've done an incredible job spreading the word about InfoWars, the broadcast, the articles,
[02:58:23.594 --> 02:58:29.114]   the videos, the special guests we have, our other great hosts. You've done an amazing job praying for us.
[02:58:29.314 --> 02:58:35.238]  You've done an incredible job buying the products and financially supporting us so we can support you in this critical fight.
[02:58:35.579 --> 02:58:43.345]  That's why I'm asking every viewer and every listener to understand we have reached the most critical point in our battle against the globalists in our 28-year history.
[02:58:44.426 --> 02:58:48.429]  We have major plans in development and major operations that are very close to being launched.
[02:58:48.770 --> 02:58:56.176]  We have so many projects that are not known to the enemy that we've been secretly financing, and just a lot of exciting things that have been going on.
[02:58:56.716 --> 02:58:58.918]  We only deliver with our information.
[02:58:58.938 --> 02:59:04.342]  We only deliver with real results against the New World Order, but we cannot do it without your support.
[02:59:04.382 --> 02:59:09.867]  So I'm asking you now, ladies and gentlemen, to not procrastinate and to go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:59:10.287 --> 02:59:12.109]  Plus, we've got items that you definitely want.
[02:59:12.529 --> 02:59:19.394]  Ladies and gentlemen, people have asked me for over 15 years since I wrote my last book to write a new book.
[02:59:20.075 --> 02:59:27.627]   And I finally got some of the researchers together and top editors to condense all the known enemy battle plans
[02:59:27.627 --> 02:59:31.326]   against humanity into this new book that comes out in August.
[02:59:31.326 --> 02:59:36.567]   You can pre-order it right now at Infowarsstore.com and secure a signed copy as well.
[02:59:36.567 --> 02:59:41.086]   We need the funds right now and you really need this book, especially for your friends,
[02:59:41.086 --> 02:59:44.688]   your family, your neighbors, because people are really listening right now and waking
[02:59:44.688 --> 02:59:45.688]  up to the great reset.
[02:59:45.688 --> 02:59:50.807]   Steve Bannon has said it is the most powerful book since the founding fathers when it comes
[02:59:50.807 --> 02:59:51.987]  to fighting tyranny.
[02:59:51.987 --> 02:59:55.867]   He said it's the blueprint of defeating the fourth turning New World Order takeover.
[02:59:55.867 --> 02:59:57.586]  I couldn't believe he said it, but it's true.
[02:59:57.586 --> 03:00:00.346]  He read the book and he was blown away.
[03:00:00.346 --> 03:00:02.707]   Others that have read the book have been completely blown away.
[03:00:02.707 --> 03:00:04.266]  You need to read this book.
[03:00:04.266 --> 03:00:10.027]   It is exclusively available through Skyhorse Publishing at Infowars.com and Amazon and
[03:00:10.027 --> 03:00:11.027]  other places.
[03:00:11.027 --> 03:00:14.827]   But when I say it's exclusively available at Infowars.com, that's where you can get
[03:00:14.827 --> 03:00:15.827]  the signed copies.
[03:00:15.827 --> 03:00:18.427]  Now, that said, this will keep us on air.
