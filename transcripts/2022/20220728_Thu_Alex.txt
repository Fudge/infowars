[00:00.000 --> 00:28.520]  I got to tell you, this book, the great reset in the war for the world, the left in the mainstream
[00:28.520 --> 00:33.920]  media are going to have to sit there, and we've got to force them to respond to this
[00:33.920 --> 00:34.920]  book.
[00:34.920 --> 00:36.680]  This book is that important.
[00:36.680 --> 00:39.040]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter.
[00:39.040 --> 00:44.640]  If you compare the finest, and I'm telling you, you take MIT technology review, you take
[00:44.640 --> 00:49.640]  science, take all these magazines and journals, add the electronic part of it, and you know,
[00:49.640 --> 00:56.120]  NPR, PBS, all of it, I'll match up and we'll go through and we'll do what Alex Jones put
[00:56.120 --> 01:01.480]  out there versus what your collective body has put out there, and if you're a human being
[01:01.480 --> 01:04.520]  and just watching it, you say, well, Alex Jones was the head of this, not only that,
[01:04.520 --> 01:05.520]  he kind of explained it.
[01:05.520 --> 01:12.240]  They're just in this huge revolution against choice and free will and normal technological
[01:12.240 --> 01:15.840]  development and adoption of technology that empowers humanity.
[01:15.840 --> 01:21.440]  Instead, they want adoption of technology, forced adoption, world IDs, global social
[01:21.440 --> 01:26.520]  credit scores, carbon taxes that dominate and monitor every facet of our launch.
[01:26.520 --> 01:32.920]  You make the case of what the not just the new world order is, but using this great reset
[01:32.920 --> 01:37.520]  to really take up, there's a whole idea of control and authoritarianism.
[01:37.520 --> 01:42.360]  They have decided to trigger a controlled collapse and then bring in a new dark age
[01:42.360 --> 01:47.080]  to control the general public where they will be in their Elysium fields.
[01:47.080 --> 01:49.320]  There is no new technology coming in.
[01:49.320 --> 01:53.840]  They're blocking that, and so really, they're just imploding things under the cloud pivot
[01:53.840 --> 01:57.040]  model to show that they can't get that control over us.
[01:57.040 --> 01:59.160]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter.
[01:59.160 --> 02:04.720]  He has presented tons of valid evidence and facts that I think have been really, really
[02:04.720 --> 02:10.440]  important to raising consciousness through what the sort of technocratic global elite
[02:10.440 --> 02:12.480]  really want to do.
[02:12.480 --> 02:18.120]  The true thing that you've done, which is stunning, if you look at the evidence of
[02:18.120 --> 02:22.160]  that and the facts, you are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:22.160 --> 02:23.160]  That is very rare.
[02:23.160 --> 02:27.560]  You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[02:27.560 --> 02:31.800]  This book, The Great Reset in the War for the World, I'm telling you, everybody in America,
[02:31.800 --> 02:34.760]  the people that hate Alex Jones the most have to read this book.
[02:34.760 --> 02:36.400]  This is no beach read.
[02:36.400 --> 02:38.920]  You're not going to be flipping pages or you're going to be having a pin out and you're going
[02:38.920 --> 02:39.920]  to be underlining stuff.
[02:39.920 --> 02:40.920]  It's amazing.
[02:40.920 --> 02:46.800]  The Great Reset in the War for the World by Alex Jones.
[02:46.800 --> 02:49.120]  Come now at amazonandinfowarsstore.com.
[02:49.120 --> 02:58.880]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling
[02:58.880 --> 03:05.120]  oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[03:05.120 --> 03:13.080]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs, which by any decent standard, they ought not
[03:13.080 --> 03:14.080]  to enjoy.
[03:14.080 --> 03:33.760]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[03:33.760 --> 03:35.960]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[03:35.960 --> 03:41.200]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[03:41.200 --> 03:46.080]  Precontaining vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[03:46.080 --> 03:47.080]  pediatrics.
[03:47.080 --> 03:51.600]  These new studies suggest that the offices that the preservatives may actually be associated
[03:51.600 --> 03:54.080]  with improved behavior and mental performance.
[03:54.080 --> 03:58.880]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[03:58.880 --> 04:03.840]  Oh yeah, the government had the right under U.S. law to conduct secret testing on the
[04:03.840 --> 04:06.000]  American public under a specific condition.
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.640]  We have to work with dark side over the last 10 times in the shadows.
[04:10.640 --> 04:14.680]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[04:14.680 --> 04:15.680]  Well, join me.
[04:15.680 --> 04:21.640]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to say it's a need for a new world order.
[04:21.640 --> 04:47.640]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[05:10.600 --> 05:15.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever as we reach the critical heart of
[05:15.600 --> 05:20.880]  the battle that you spread the word and that you support liberty and that you warn people
[05:20.880 --> 05:23.560]  like you've never done before.
[05:23.560 --> 05:25.920]  We have come so far together.
[05:25.920 --> 05:27.320]  Please help keep us from the air.
[05:27.320 --> 05:30.960]  We're under massive attack right now, but we're going to win with your help.
[05:30.960 --> 05:34.280]  We're going to overcome this with your help and with God's blessing.
[05:34.280 --> 05:37.680]  Please go to infoworkstore.com and get this book.
[05:37.680 --> 05:40.000]  Many, many, many years of research have gone into this.
[05:40.000 --> 05:45.560]  The Great Reset and the War for the World available right now at infoworkstore.com.
[05:45.560 --> 05:48.080]  There's also signed copies available as well.
[05:48.080 --> 05:51.640]  We've got a lot of other big projects we're working on that are about to start launching
[05:51.640 --> 05:56.240]  as well, but this is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because
[05:56.240 --> 05:58.600]  it warns the world of the globalist plan.
[05:58.600 --> 06:24.160]  Get the Great Reset at infoworkstore.com.
[06:24.160 --> 06:30.000]  Recently the central bank digital currencies have been the talking point at the global
[06:30.000 --> 06:35.240]  confabs because they lead to the creation of a global currency system.
[06:35.240 --> 06:42.200]  Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to the session on resetting digital currencies.
[06:42.200 --> 06:47.400]  The theme of this year's forum, as you know, is a crucial year to rebuild trust.
[06:47.400 --> 06:54.400]  The digital payment system can help reduce these logistical costs, can help remove the
[06:54.400 --> 06:55.840]  dangers of holding cash.
[06:55.840 --> 07:02.880]  As the architects of multiple global crises pour on the tyranny, the IMF is enjoying an
[07:02.880 --> 07:09.440]  elevated position as the problem solver most nations turn to for help, racketeering on
[07:09.440 --> 07:10.960]  a global scale.
[07:10.960 --> 07:17.680]  With all the current issues on our agenda, we tend to forget that we are in the midst
[07:17.680 --> 07:25.400]  of the forced industry revolution, which accelerates global change in much more comprehensive
[07:25.400 --> 07:29.920]  and faster ways than the previous three revolutions.
[07:29.920 --> 07:35.880]  The objective is to quickly recognize the potential of new technologies.
[07:35.880 --> 07:40.040]  History is truly at a turning point.
[07:40.040 --> 07:46.480]  We do not yet know the full extent and the systemic and structural changes which will
[07:46.480 --> 07:48.120]  happen.
[07:48.120 --> 07:56.800]  However, we do know that global energy systems, food systems and supply chains will be deeply
[07:56.800 --> 07:58.300]  affected.
[07:58.300 --> 08:03.360]  And as Bloomberg gleefully reported, key Democratic congressional allies are urging President
[08:03.360 --> 08:08.440]  Joe Biden's administration to support a new injection of resources for countries at the
[08:08.440 --> 08:13.280]  IMF to help them deal with the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
[08:13.280 --> 08:20.600]  To the tune of at least $650 billion in additional IMF reserve assets, the demand is being led
[08:20.600 --> 08:25.240]  by Representative Pramila Jayapal and Senator Elizabeth Warren.
[08:25.240 --> 08:30.640]  Zero hedge recently put the puzzle pieces together concerning the Democrats' proposed
[08:30.640 --> 08:37.960]  $650 billion flooding of the IMF with special drawing right funds.
[08:37.960 --> 08:41.600]  What are special drawing right funds?
[08:41.600 --> 08:48.920]  The special drawing right, or SDR, was created by the IMF in 1969 to supplement the official
[08:48.920 --> 08:51.800]  reserves of its member countries.
[08:51.800 --> 08:56.760]  The SDR is an interest bearing international reserve asset that can only be held by the
[08:56.760 --> 09:03.600]  IMF, its member countries, and designated official entities known as prescribed holders.
[09:03.600 --> 09:08.920]  In addition to this role, the SDR serves as the unit of account of the IMF and several
[09:08.920 --> 09:11.080]  other international organizations.
[09:11.080 --> 09:17.160]  Zero hedge writes, each new crisis brings global banks closer to their goal, the introduction
[09:17.160 --> 09:23.640]  of national digital currencies, and the SDR basket become the de facto reserve trading
[09:23.640 --> 09:25.560]  tool for the world.
[09:25.560 --> 09:31.160]  Why do Democrats specifically want aid denominated in SDRs?
[09:31.160 --> 09:36.840]  Because funding allocations in the US have already hit their maximum, and new funding
[09:36.840 --> 09:39.320]  bills are being defeated in the Senate.
[09:39.320 --> 09:42.840]  At the IMF, there are no checks and balances.
[09:42.840 --> 09:49.680]  They can ask for almost any amount of money in the form of SDRs without oversight.
[09:49.680 --> 09:55.400]  There are always strings attached when it comes to the IMF, and in exchange for SDRs,
[09:55.400 --> 09:59.960]  the globalists will certainly want more centralized control.
[09:59.960 --> 10:05.720]  The Ukrainian war is not merely a money laundering operation, it is a linchpin to transfer the
[10:05.720 --> 10:11.680]  global economy out of the money printing of central banks, and directly into the hands
[10:11.680 --> 10:14.240]  of globalists controlling the IMF.
[10:14.240 --> 10:20.760]  We are being looted in real time of our property, currency, sovereignty, and our very lives.
[10:20.760 --> 10:46.760]  John Bown reporting.
[10:46.760 --> 11:08.360]  I am extremely, extremely excited about all of that, and we're going to be getting into
[11:08.360 --> 11:10.680]  a lot more of it today.
[11:10.680 --> 11:17.920]  So as bad as the situation is, we also have a lot of hope as well right now.
[11:17.920 --> 11:27.400]  But the level of brainwashing, the level of gaslighting that is going on is next level.
[11:27.400 --> 11:33.200]  Because you have to understand, this propaganda system we see, and these puppets we see, even
[11:33.200 --> 11:37.880]  Klaus Schwab, even Bill Gates are not the highest level, though they're high-level generals
[11:37.880 --> 11:44.120]  in this, but there are many of these people like Biden and Gavin Newsom and Macron and
[11:44.120 --> 11:52.440]  the rest of them, that's just their placeholder that, again, takes the blame for the globalist
[11:52.440 --> 11:53.440]  operation.
[11:53.440 --> 11:57.320]  And if we just blame the minions, we never blame the system that's written all the battle
[11:57.320 --> 12:01.920]  plans, the white papers, the operational systems to carry out what we're living in.
[12:01.920 --> 12:06.320]  That's why I've been able to, with total precision, to predict exactly what's going to happen.
[12:06.320 --> 12:10.640]  Because they're in control of most of the systems of the planet and they're trying to
[12:10.640 --> 12:16.240]  get full control, and we are in a race to mobilize our states, our counties, our cities,
[12:16.240 --> 12:21.600]  our governments, our municipalities around the world, our churches, our educational
[12:21.600 --> 12:28.080]  systems to understand this societal collapse system that they call the Great Reset.
[12:28.080 --> 12:30.400]  And on our ashes, they're built back better.
[12:30.400 --> 12:33.280]  So everything else flows from that.
[12:33.280 --> 12:38.280]  That's the heart of the Hydra, and we can fight the heads of the Hydra all day long
[12:38.280 --> 12:43.640]  as much as we want, but until we start addressing the heart of the matter, the New World Order,
[12:43.640 --> 12:47.160]  we don't have a hope in hell.
[12:47.160 --> 12:59.760]  The good news is, all over the world, from Pakistan to Mexico to Iraq to Canada to Germany
[12:59.760 --> 13:06.360]  to Sri Lanka, just hundreds and hundreds of uprisings against the globalists, and people
[13:06.360 --> 13:10.600]  are talking about the Great Reset, they're talking about Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates,
[13:10.600 --> 13:14.960]  India, you name it, they're talking about the New World Order.
[13:14.960 --> 13:20.320]  And so it's actually happening, humanity is getting caught up with what is actually being
[13:20.320 --> 13:23.400]  done to us, and that is our main mission here.
[13:23.400 --> 13:27.120]  Yes, we'll break down the symptoms of the disease.
[13:27.120 --> 13:31.080]  Yes, we'll break down what they're doing in real time to recognize their operations.
[13:31.080 --> 13:36.040]  Please understand, Klaus Schwab says, we're going to cut the energy off and make you transition
[13:36.040 --> 13:40.920]  into a system, and we're using COVID as the pretext to make the initial cut.
[13:40.920 --> 13:44.920]  And then after that, we're going to expand to climate lockdowns by cutting off the fuel.
[13:44.920 --> 13:53.120]  I'm on air 32 months ago with total precision saying exactly what would happen in the next
[13:53.120 --> 13:55.600]  three years, and we're here.
[13:55.600 --> 14:00.520]  Because we have the damn battle plan, and there is nothing more frustrating than sitting
[14:00.520 --> 14:05.400]  here trying to put out brush fires that are being started by the globalist dragon.
[14:05.400 --> 14:13.280]  You slay the dragon, or it will continue to fly around burning down our civilization.
[14:13.280 --> 14:16.920]  Speaking of that, we have more leftists being indicted for setting fires all over the United
[14:16.920 --> 14:17.920]  States.
[14:17.920 --> 14:20.520]  And they said, and they're arrested, all of them.
[14:20.520 --> 14:24.320]  Same thing in Europe, same thing in Russia, same thing in Mexico, same thing in Chile.
[14:24.320 --> 14:32.200]  They say, we're doing this to bring down civilization and to cut off the food so that we can depopulate
[14:32.200 --> 14:33.960]  the earth and save it.
[14:33.960 --> 14:35.640]  Where are they getting the programming from?
[14:35.640 --> 14:36.800]  Where are they getting the directives from?
[14:36.800 --> 14:41.240]  Well, you see it in Hollywood, you see it in universities, you see it in primary education,
[14:41.240 --> 14:45.600]  you see it in the culture everywhere, and that's who these people are.
[14:45.600 --> 14:49.160]  Now, here's the big announcement.
[14:49.160 --> 14:55.760]  Everything the World Economic Forum says they get, because no one's been opposing them until
[14:55.760 --> 14:56.760]  now.
[14:56.760 --> 14:57.760]  Who are they?
[14:57.760 --> 14:59.600]  They're just the mouthpiece of the big global corporations.
[14:59.600 --> 15:03.640]  A month ago, the UN Secretary General said we've signed a deal to coordinate and have
[15:03.640 --> 15:06.320]  the WEF basically tell us what to do.
[15:06.320 --> 15:11.400]  Last week, they signed a further deal specifically saying they are in command of the health care
[15:11.400 --> 15:13.960]  policy and more of the UN.
[15:13.960 --> 15:18.440]  So, first, they have an international coup of the UN having power transferred to it,
[15:18.440 --> 15:23.000]  and then the corporations come right in like musical chairs and move themselves into the
[15:23.000 --> 15:29.360]  position openly to normalize the Fortune 100 and the private central banks that finance
[15:29.360 --> 15:31.160]  about a nothing.
[15:31.160 --> 15:32.160]  It's just incredible.
[15:32.160 --> 15:36.360]  We are at such an amazing moment, I'm going to hit these articles, but the big announcement
[15:36.360 --> 15:42.280]  when we come back, the WEF has charted our course of disaster, driven our Titanic right
[15:42.280 --> 15:46.040]  into the ice field, right into the icebergs.
[15:46.040 --> 15:48.640]  And now the next part of the phase is here.
[15:48.640 --> 15:53.000]  You think they're moving to ban beef is bad, or ban mother and father is bad.
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.720]  Wait till you hear their next move, stay with us.
[15:55.720 --> 16:05.080]  The globalist great reset or the war for the world is here, but humanity is not being caught
[16:05.080 --> 16:09.560]  flat footed because of info wars and because of your support.
[16:09.560 --> 16:14.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever as we reach the critical heart
[16:14.080 --> 16:19.080]  of the battle that you spread the word and that you support liberty and that you warn
[16:19.080 --> 16:22.160]  people like you've never done before.
[16:22.160 --> 16:26.960]  We have come so far together, please help keep us on the air, we're under massive attack
[16:26.960 --> 16:29.560]  right now, but we're going to win with your help.
[16:29.560 --> 16:32.880]  We're going to overcome this with your help and with God's blessing.
[16:32.880 --> 16:36.280]  Please go to infoworkstore.com and get this book.
[16:36.280 --> 16:40.160]  Many many many years of research have gone into this, the great reset and the war for
[16:40.160 --> 16:46.920]  the world available right now at infoworkstore.com, there's also signed copies available as well.
[16:46.920 --> 16:51.040]  We got a lot of other big projects we're working on that are about to start launching as well,
[16:51.040 --> 16:55.000]  but this is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because it
[16:55.000 --> 16:57.240]  warns the world of the globalist plan.

[19:55.080 --> 20:00.480]  appreciates hair and beard support for men I go and see him quite often now.
[20:00.480 --> 20:18.880]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[20:18.880 --> 20:35.640]  I take the most attack on humanity personal because I am human I am a human supremacist
[20:35.640 --> 20:44.880]  not a black supremacist not a white supremacist not a brown supremacist but a human supremacist
[20:44.880 --> 20:50.200]  I'm pro-human I get chills thinking about who we are and how amazing we are when we're
[20:50.200 --> 20:58.920]  focused and we're connected to God we're unstoppable and the New World Order knows that they want
[20:58.920 --> 21:03.360]  to play God they want to tell us to hate ourselves and have us fight with each other they want
[21:03.360 --> 21:07.400]  to disease us and poison us and drug us and dumb us down we're coming together and they
[21:07.400 --> 21:14.040]  can't stop us catch the spirit catch the drift.
[21:14.040 --> 21:20.200]  We are live broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday Thursday transmission so let me
[21:20.200 --> 21:25.280]  go ahead and make a big announcement you know you knew it was coming if you watch my film
[21:25.280 --> 21:33.960]  in game made in 2007 or if you watch Obama Deception made in 2009 if you watch those
[21:33.960 --> 21:38.880]  two films but you can still find online because there was thousands of copies there's a few
[21:38.880 --> 21:44.160]  copies left here and there they took down the ones on YouTube and stuff with 50 million
[21:44.160 --> 21:48.680]  20 million views you can still find them 500,000 million views here they slapped that down another
[21:48.680 --> 21:55.720]  one pops up the Obama Deception in game why don't you get in a time machine and go back
[21:55.720 --> 22:05.320]  to the future because you go back to those films from 13 years ago from 15 16 17 years
[22:05.320 --> 22:14.600]  ago and then you're not going back you're going forward you're going back to the future
[22:14.600 --> 22:20.600]  you're you're not getting tomorrow's news today you're getting 20 years from now today
[22:20.600 --> 22:24.880]  because we know the enemy battle plan and that's the secret they can't deal with because
[22:24.880 --> 22:31.360]  I knew our power was predicting the enemy's operations because I'd seen stuff they launched
[22:31.360 --> 22:40.000]  in the 1850s come true by the 1920s I saw the New World Order's 50 year 100 year plans
[22:40.000 --> 22:48.760]  for my own self they say the West plans for a year the Chinese plan for 50 years folks
[22:48.760 --> 22:53.920]  the New World Order plans in 100 and 200 year blocks and when you start thinking like they
[22:53.920 --> 23:05.000]  do it's game over for them so just as much as I know tomorrow morning at 6 35 a.m. or
[23:05.000 --> 23:11.000]  whatever it is Texas time central time what time sunrise tomorrow guys look up sunrise
[23:11.000 --> 23:20.600]  just type in sunrise tomorrow Google tell you I know that big old yellow ball that controlled
[23:20.600 --> 23:26.920]  thermonuclear explosion is going to come rising back up and I know just like that sun's going
[23:26.920 --> 23:35.040]  to come up tomorrow that the 6 45 a.m. is the time so I know at 6 45 a.m. tomorrow the
[23:35.040 --> 23:45.840]  sun's going to crest the horizon just like I know they would implode our borders just
[23:45.840 --> 23:50.720]  like I knew they'd have pedophile drag queen story time just like I knew they devalue the
[23:50.720 --> 23:57.200]  currency just like I knew they'd launch wars with Russia just like I knew they would start
[23:57.200 --> 24:01.800]  banning beef and then farms period and people said there's no way they'll ban beef there's
[24:01.800 --> 24:08.440]  no way they'll force farmers off their land there's no way they'll do it and now starting
[24:08.440 --> 24:16.480]  the Pacific in Australia and New Zealand through Western Europe through all over North America
[24:16.480 --> 24:20.240]  the IMF and World Bank are in control and they're coming into the government state control
[24:20.240 --> 24:25.360]  and they're saying you are going to shut down your farms and put regulations on them so
[24:25.360 --> 24:29.880]  hard unless they're big corporate farms that the small and medium sized farms and ranches
[24:29.880 --> 24:36.320]  can't operate whether you're in California or whether you're in the Netherlands whether
[24:36.320 --> 24:46.040]  you're in Chile or Argentina or whether you're in Nigeria everywhere except China they're
[24:46.040 --> 24:51.480]  not putting regulations on their people they're expanding and Russia but everywhere this is
[24:51.480 --> 24:57.200]  happening so just like clockwork just like I know we're going to break in four minutes
[24:57.200 --> 25:03.960]  exactly they got an atomic clock in here I knew this was coming so so so they started
[25:03.960 --> 25:08.720]  oh this year we only ban 30 percent of your cows next year 50 and within five years we'll
[25:08.720 --> 25:12.040]  ban 90 percent of your cows and the Netherlands and then now they're announcing it all over
[25:12.040 --> 25:18.480]  the world and who is announcing who's our boss who's our dictator who's in control drumroll
[25:18.480 --> 25:25.440]  please we'll put the live show headline up on screen it's all over New York Times Washington
[25:25.440 --> 25:34.120]  Post it's so wonderful WEF slash UN they've now officially merged a month ago they publicly
[25:34.120 --> 25:45.360]  merged WEF UN call for total total total World Economic Forum Davos Group and the UN call
[25:45.360 --> 25:54.680]  for total ban on private car ownership read that again World Economic Forum UN call for
[25:54.680 --> 26:07.200]  total ban on private car ownership launching next phase of great reset collapse and when
[26:07.200 --> 26:12.280]  you read the articles in the press release by the WEF the UN they say it does not matter
[26:12.280 --> 26:19.840]  what governments do we are acting off the power they will accept this new beautiful
[26:19.840 --> 26:29.920]  beautiful transition there is no transition but death there is no transition but collapse
[26:29.920 --> 26:39.840]  think of the magnitude of that think of the reality of that think of where we are they're
[26:39.840 --> 26:46.880]  destroying the social networks of humans they're destroying the small businesses the small farms
[26:46.880 --> 26:51.840]  they are annihilating the social contract and they're officially calling go read it for
[26:51.840 --> 26:56.800]  yourself it's on info wars.com or just type in WEF calls for end of private car ownership
[26:56.800 --> 27:03.800]  where there's all these bot cars robot self-driving cars that's coming next they admit that and
[27:03.800 --> 27:09.560]  then you've got to only use those because listen you're not using that car you care about you
[27:09.560 --> 27:14.240]  take care of you love that's yours in the morning and at lunch in the afternoon and
[27:14.240 --> 27:21.920]  when you go to the beach you go to an allotment from a corporate company and a robot car pulls
[27:21.920 --> 27:29.160]  up and drives you where you're going how are they going to make us adopt that first shut
[27:29.160 --> 27:33.840]  down the regular infrastructure then ration what you're able to get and make you stand
[27:33.840 --> 27:39.320]  in line to get a car and see because they built our infrastructure off the auto bond
[27:39.320 --> 27:46.240]  system that Hitler invented Eisenhower copied that and it built a really decentralized nation
[27:46.240 --> 27:51.040]  and made us almost impossible to invade we've got so many roads and so much infrastructure
[27:51.040 --> 27:55.160]  but if you cut the energy off it makes you incredibly weak because you're isolated in
[27:55.160 --> 28:06.040]  all this urban sprawl but if you can make people then use a car that works 20 hours
[28:06.040 --> 28:12.320]  a day that everybody else is in you have no car ownership no mobility and now you're
[28:12.320 --> 28:17.720]  locked in that suburb you're now locked on that farm you're now locked in that community
[28:17.720 --> 28:23.040]  that's decentralized and the centralizers don't want that they want to drive you in to the
[28:23.040 --> 28:28.240]  big mega cities where everywhere you go there's high rises being built and 250 square foot
[28:28.240 --> 28:32.560]  coffin apartments built you say they'll never make us do that they'll never make us eat
[28:32.560 --> 28:38.360]  bugs they'll never make us get an electric car but they will buy bureaucratic fiat and
[28:38.360 --> 28:45.720]  dictatorship show in the year 2022 the gauntlet was thrown now that they're going to take
[28:45.720 --> 28:52.480]  our cars and take our fossil fuels they already done almost all of it and give us no replacement
[28:52.480 --> 28:56.960]  but collapse and death this is how they're going to be populated stay with us
[28:56.960 --> 29:04.760]  the globalist great reset or the war for the world is here but humanity is not being caught

[33:15.960 --> 33:23.840]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones i'm gonna go ahead in the
[33:23.840 --> 33:32.760]  next segment about some real secrets i don't just know all the stuff from the documents
[33:32.760 --> 33:39.960]  i know 95% of it from that but i like so many other people have been given i guess what
[33:39.960 --> 33:49.920]  they would call divine inspiration or just those magic moments and for over 30 years
[33:49.920 --> 34:03.200]  i have had recurring dreams and i saw what was coming and literally had countless dreams
[34:03.200 --> 34:09.480]  but also recurring dreams about what was going to be unfolding and maybe i won't do it next
[34:09.480 --> 34:15.720]  segment it's so heavy but i'll try to give you the introduction to it but i just did
[34:15.720 --> 34:23.080]  it earlier and it's human supremacy and i like to show exhibits of anything i talk
[34:23.080 --> 34:29.320]  about so maybe i won't explain human supremacy today because it's such a big deal but will
[34:29.320 --> 34:35.480]  you guys please print me the opening part of genesis where god gives us dominion over
[34:35.480 --> 34:40.320]  the earth whether you believe in that or not you got to decide whether you have dominion
[34:40.320 --> 34:44.800]  over yourself and you got to decide whether it's god that's going to have dominion over
[34:44.800 --> 34:50.480]  you that you get orders from as an agent of god or whether some other human that's jacked
[34:50.480 --> 34:56.080]  into the evil force is going to have dominion over you but i realized that my 28 years on
[34:56.080 --> 35:04.120]  air just during the last few breaks has now come to the pinnacle of the most important
[35:04.120 --> 35:11.200]  information we're ever going to reveal here on air and it's quite a download but all the
[35:11.200 --> 35:20.760]  planets aligned all the information just condensed it was that galaxy brain moment that so many
[35:20.760 --> 35:28.320]  seek but it's god's plan and it really is do we want to have a human plan or a post human
[35:28.320 --> 35:33.600]  plan no vol horari and claus Schwab and bill gates say humans are obsolete we're scum because
[35:33.600 --> 35:40.080]  they know we are their competition they know that if we go for what we want and what god
[35:40.080 --> 35:44.000]  wants to have they can't compete with that transmission they can't compete with that
[35:44.000 --> 35:52.800]  blueprint they can't compete without architecture they can't compete with that master plan but
[35:52.800 --> 35:58.480]  i just see it now it'll be so clear soon are you pro human or are you anti human and of
[35:58.480 --> 36:02.680]  course we wrote the book on are you pro human or anti human now it's being picked up by the
[36:02.680 --> 36:08.400]  intellectuals and the human resistance everywhere but you are the human resistance to this alien
[36:08.400 --> 36:15.120]  takeover and again when i say alien takeover i don't mean some little tin foil flying saucer
[36:15.120 --> 36:28.120]  crashing in roswell from alphas and turries or from beetle geese i'm talking about the
[36:28.120 --> 36:34.720]  transmission in the universe of god's order and god's will or do you choose to serve the
[36:34.720 --> 36:49.200]  agents of death i will tell you
[36:49.200 --> 36:56.880]  we are the human supremacy movement and damn did i not have black people growing up in
[36:56.880 --> 37:07.200]  dallas texas do horrible mean racist things to me but also had black people take me in
[37:07.200 --> 37:10.680]  their house and cook me amazing dinners and literally pet me and tell me how much they
[37:10.680 --> 37:20.320]  love me and i had white people do horrible things to me in my life but also had white
[37:20.320 --> 37:28.040]  people take me in their house and pet me and tell me how great i was and i had mexicans
[37:28.040 --> 37:38.600]  break my leg but also had mexicans do wonderful things for me because they're all people and
[37:38.600 --> 37:42.640]  like martin Luther king said we're not going to judge them off what color they are we're
[37:42.640 --> 37:48.720]  going to judge them off of the character of their actions and deeds so i'm going to say
[37:48.720 --> 37:56.760]  it right now real clear i love everybody no matter what color your beautiful skin is whether
[37:56.760 --> 38:01.000]  you're a pink polka dotted speckled creature like me or whether you got beautiful ebony
[38:01.000 --> 38:13.160]  skin or you got pure beautiful white skin what i'm looking for is porcelain skin what
[38:13.160 --> 38:17.320]  i care about your heart and your guts and your mind and you're under attack by these
[38:17.320 --> 38:22.520]  satanists and they want to kill you and they want to kill your children and i say we set
[38:22.520 --> 38:28.680]  our differences aside and i say we come together and we beat these people and we smash their
[38:28.680 --> 38:36.160]  technocracy and we build the future together and we can do anything with our real diversity
[38:36.160 --> 38:40.040]  these enemies tell us all day about diversity they mean divided and conquered groups of
[38:40.040 --> 38:47.120]  people separate from each other i want unity they claim they're going to give us unity
[38:47.120 --> 38:52.040]  with their ai telling us what to do that's a satanic unity and a counterfeit of god's
[38:52.040 --> 38:56.680]  unity our unity will come out of our individual actions based on love and justice and freedom
[38:56.680 --> 39:04.360]  and god's spirit coming together through the conflict that is about to unfold so you've
[39:04.360 --> 39:10.840]  got my pledge to never surrender you have my pledge to never back down to these demons
[39:10.840 --> 39:22.000]  and these satanists you have my pledge to be 100 percent committed to you not because
[39:22.000 --> 39:30.000]  i'm some angel not because i want to save you but because i'm following god's plan
[39:30.000 --> 39:39.880]  and i know we've got to save each other i need you you need me we can't beat this without
[39:39.880 --> 39:52.320]  each other we got to do it we can't let these monsters win all over the world from africa
[39:52.320 --> 39:56.800]  to latin america to asia to north america to europe they're cutting off the power they're
[39:56.800 --> 40:00.840]  cutting off the farms they're cutting off the ranches they're harassing our hardest
[40:00.840 --> 40:04.880]  working people and they're turning this against each other and you know what when you get some
[40:04.880 --> 40:09.320]  group discriminates against you and some group hurts you and some group gangs up on you
[40:09.320 --> 40:13.440]  you get pissed and you look for a group to join that's a normal human attribute because
[40:13.440 --> 40:20.520]  you're looking for a gang to protect you but you got to transcend that and join christ gang
[40:20.520 --> 40:28.440]  god's gang and realize that jesus didn't take it on the other cheek because he was weak
[40:28.440 --> 40:33.800]  but he was teaching us how to transcend their control he wasn't backing down he wasn't a
[40:33.800 --> 40:40.760]  loser he was the winner and he used his intellect because he was the son of god to counter them
[40:40.760 --> 40:50.360]  and to show them what real strength was and he transcended death itself we must transcend
[40:50.360 --> 40:55.960]  the racism they taught us we must transcend all their garbage and realize they create
[40:55.960 --> 41:00.720]  the problem and then offer the solution as if they're the priest as if they're the arbiters
[41:00.720 --> 41:05.040]  as if they're the ones that can fix all this when they're the ones that didn't create it
[41:05.040 --> 41:11.360]  all they just grease the skids using our own weakness against us and we have to blast past
[41:11.360 --> 41:20.800]  these people we got to come together under a code of freedom and liberty and justice
[41:20.800 --> 41:25.440]  and and coming together and working together and being strong and that's what info wars
[41:25.440 --> 41:33.760]  is and that's why the enemies of humanity hate us so much because we love god and god
[41:33.760 --> 41:44.720]  loves humanity and i am a human supremacist i am a human supremacist i am a human supremacist
[41:44.720 --> 41:54.640]  i am a human supremacist i am a human supremacist that term will be the future war with the robots
[41:54.640 --> 41:59.840]  and the ai what you're hearing now is the entire future and everything they tried to stop us from
[41:59.840 --> 42:07.760]  doing our supremacy will not end with this planet we will people the stars we will colonize we will

[42:36.080 --> 42:43.840]  break the satanist because god already sent his own self down here to show us he could do it
[42:44.400 --> 42:48.400]  god would never ask us to go through an obstacle course he wouldn't go through
[42:48.400 --> 42:52.240]  and now we're going to go through what christ did and we're going to go through it and we're

[49:08.400 --> 49:12.720]  we have calls for in the private car ownership that give me that elon must tweet you gave me
[49:12.720 --> 49:17.920]  yesterday i didn't get to we said we need a new cosmology a new system of pro human future
[49:17.920 --> 49:22.560]  and human expansion my exact quote that's not a new system that's that's genesis
[49:22.560 --> 49:28.480]  that's what we just covered that's not new that's the prime directive and i know he knows that
[49:30.080 --> 49:34.560]  we're telling you it's new because we've been inside the satanic anti human order he says oh
[49:34.560 --> 49:41.360]  the new thing genesis pretty big deal what elon must understand is he a double dealer can we
[49:41.360 --> 49:46.800]  trust him i don't know he says a new philosophy of the future is needed i believe it should be
[49:46.800 --> 49:54.560]  curiosity about the universe yes expanded humanity to become a multi-planet that interstellar
[49:54.560 --> 50:01.120]  species to see what's out there perfectly said i totally endorse that and that's god's plan
[50:03.040 --> 50:06.400]  they're cutting our energy off they're attacking our fertility they've lowered our sperm counts
[50:06.400 --> 50:10.400]  90 percent they're saying they're going to ban our cars and our cows and they're doing it
[50:10.400 --> 50:18.800]  they're bringing out their world government in all of its different phases and then i've got all
[50:18.800 --> 50:29.520]  their incredible gas lighting that's taking place you got biden's said four shots saying oh i got
[50:29.520 --> 50:33.520]  this new drug that's protecting me and he goes on and says covid's here for good
[50:33.520 --> 50:43.200]  but he promised you over and over and over again if he just took the shot you'd be protected
[50:45.120 --> 50:51.440]  here let's go ahead and roll this clip of biden today saying covid's with us forever and then
[50:51.440 --> 50:59.280]  you've got berks saying oh we always knew it wouldn't work but they didn't tell trump that here it is
[50:59.280 --> 51:05.120]  let's keep investing in these tools vaccinations treatments tests and more so we can help making
[51:05.120 --> 51:11.280]  them available to americans the american people on a permanent basis let's get moving and i say
[51:11.280 --> 51:16.080]  permanent basis as long as they are needed want to get your take on a lot of people looking at
[51:16.080 --> 51:22.320]  the president now having this and all these people who've been fully vaccinated and boosted and all
[51:22.320 --> 51:27.200]  of that and they're getting it the 20 percent or so of americans who've not been vaccinated might
[51:27.200 --> 51:33.760]  look at that doctor and say well why bother why bother what do you what do you tell them well
[51:33.760 --> 51:38.800]  if you're across the south um and you're in the middle of this wave what's going to save you right
[51:38.800 --> 51:44.720]  now is pax lovin but once we get through this wave during that law you should get vaccinated and
[51:44.720 --> 51:50.480]  boosted because we do believe it will protect you particularly if you're over 70 i knew these
[51:50.480 --> 51:55.040]  vaccines were not going to protect against infection and i think we overplayed the vaccines
[51:55.040 --> 52:00.240]  and it made people then worry that it's not going to protect against severe disease and
[52:00.240 --> 52:06.960]  hospitalization it will but let's be very clear 50 of the people who died from the amicron surge
[52:06.960 --> 52:14.400]  were older vaccine so that's total doubles speak it will protect you but it won't but we will save
[52:14.400 --> 52:20.080]  you we've got something new for you they rope you in the destroy your immune system and they
[52:20.080 --> 52:26.720]  say but don't worry we got a new drug for you think about the criminal level of that now i
[52:26.720 --> 52:36.560]  want to move in now to inflation let's let's let's let's move into inflation we have the
[52:36.560 --> 52:43.920]  by-demonstration saying there is no inflation and they've got their press secretary saying there's no
[52:43.920 --> 52:53.280]  no inflation but then when you look deeper into it all there is is inflation all there is is
[52:53.280 --> 52:59.680]  recession in fact this particular clip we've got is recession we're beyond recession we're in a totally
[52:59.680 --> 53:06.480]  mismanaged by design inflationary system that destroys small businesses and builds up the
[53:06.480 --> 53:15.760]  big central businesses and we've got clip nine of her saying that there is no consensus that
[53:18.160 --> 53:22.640]  our recession is the definition then we'll play the definition of recession after that here it is
[53:23.200 --> 53:28.880]  things are going so great though then why is it the white house officials are trying to redefine
[53:28.880 --> 53:34.240]  recession no we're not redefining recession if we all understand the recession to be two consecutive
[53:34.240 --> 53:39.280]  quarters of negative GDP growth in a row and then you have white house officials come up here to say
[53:39.280 --> 53:44.160]  no no no that's not what a recession is it's something else how is that not redefining recession
[53:44.160 --> 53:50.560]  because that's not the definition that is not the definition right these said in 2008 of course
[53:50.560 --> 53:56.720]  economists have a technical definition which is of a recession which is two consecutive quarters
[53:56.720 --> 54:04.000]  of negative growth i can tell you this is that two consecutive two negative quarters of GDP growth
[54:04.000 --> 54:09.600]  is not the technical definition of a recession it is not it is not why did he say that it is not
[54:09.600 --> 54:15.360]  i can i can speak to i can speak to you to what he said yesterday in front of all of you which is
[54:15.360 --> 54:20.560]  the last thing that you just repeated there are many factors there are many factors economic
[54:20.560 --> 54:28.640]  factors and indicators to consider and i will say that the textbook definition of recession
[54:28.640 --> 54:36.960]  is not is not two negative quarters of GDP from the dictionary of finance and investment terms
[54:40.080 --> 54:40.800]  recession
[54:40.800 --> 54:55.440]  and it is exactly what we just said a downturn economic activity defined by many economies as
[54:55.440 --> 55:01.440]  at least two consecutive quarters of decline in the country's gross domestic product
[55:04.640 --> 55:10.480]  maybe like they said to her hey you're wearing a red suit she said no i'm wearing a black suit
[55:10.480 --> 55:14.320]  or i'm wearing a green suit we're like no you're you're wearing a red suit she goes your color

[59:45.920 --> 59:56.240]  preparetoday.com if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[59:56.240 --> 1:00:05.920]  after being deleted by youtube and social media in 2018 most people did nothing
[1:00:05.920 --> 1:00:12.880]  to defend alex jones or info wars instead they obediently learned the new rules and
[1:00:12.880 --> 1:00:19.360]  rationalized their submission as a necessary evil as a result things have only gotten worse
[1:00:19.360 --> 1:00:26.400]  for everyone and without any recourse they are about to get much worse alex jones is now patient
[1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:33.680]  zero for america's new de facto justice system brought to you by the fear complacency action of
[1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:40.400]  the people because we take it here's how we can all expect to now be done even though jones never
[1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:47.120]  mentioned their name and the parents were sought a retraction alex jones is being sued for defamation
[1:00:47.120 --> 1:00:53.440]  and intentional infliction of emotional distress by parents of children who were murdered at sandy
[1:00:53.440 --> 1:01:00.720]  hook elementary school the rest of the plaintiffs are federal agents and the legal team is comprised
[1:01:00.720 --> 1:01:06.880]  of highly politicized members of the anti gun lobby who have admitted their intention is to
[1:01:06.880 --> 1:01:13.680]  silence alex jones so with this new precedent if you dare question the official narrative say for
[1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:20.400]  example the school shooting in uvaldi texas then someone can sue you into oblivion for emotional
[1:01:20.400 --> 1:01:26.800]  distress but it only gets worse the plaintiffs claim that alex jones was the perpetrator
[1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:33.680]  of the sandy hook crisis actor conspiracy theory which is demonstrably false after all the censorship
[1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:40.800]  and deleted videos one can still find hours and hours of video content compiled from hundreds
[1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:48.160]  of sources all questioning the official narrative of sandy hook it was arguably the most discussed
[1:01:48.160 --> 1:01:56.160]  conspiracy theory since 9 11 and over the course of seven years alex jones spent less than 30 minutes
[1:01:56.160 --> 1:02:02.480]  discussing it we know this because it's all part of the public record but these radical judges do
[1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:07.760]  not care about evidence i am not currently representing alex jones so i am free to speak
[1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:13.680]  my mind they're already apparently i've heard that the plaintiffs lawyers are complaining
[1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:19.440]  about me speaking out about the case that's how corrupt these plaintiffs lawyers are their
[1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:25.200]  political hacks standing on the bodies of dead kids to line their pockets and take away other
[1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:30.800]  people's political rights and i find it disgusting what they've done and so but in this particular
[1:02:30.800 --> 1:02:35.520]  context jones has produced more discovery than anybody i can't find anyone that produced more
[1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:40.880]  discovery than he is and yet they pretended that he didn't why because they built their whole case
[1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:49.040]  on a big lie both judge gamble in texas and judge bellis in connecticut have found alex jones guilty
[1:02:49.040 --> 1:02:54.880]  without ever holding a trial or hearing any evidence which is worse treatment than anyone
[1:02:54.880 --> 1:03:01.760]  has ever gotten in america including charles manson and al capone and their excuse for this
[1:03:01.760 --> 1:03:07.120]  abomination of justice is they claim that jones failed to provide them with the incriminating
[1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:14.080]  evidence that they imagine must exist whatever that mysterious unspecified evidence is
[1:03:14.800 --> 1:03:20.880]  both judges have stripped jones of his first amendment right but judge gamble has gone much
[1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:28.560]  further judge maya gamble comes from cps who has been exposed for human trafficking and working
[1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:35.760]  with pedophiles gamble helped publish cps propaganda praising the state's authority and advising
[1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:42.720]  parents that it's normal for their children to lie about being abused in foster care in the alex
[1:03:42.720 --> 1:03:50.000]  jones case judge gamble has ordered that the words first amendment and free speech cannot be used
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:57.680]  by alex jones his witnesses or even his lawyers he is not allowed to defend himself judge gamble
[1:03:57.680 --> 1:04:02.800]  has instructed that the jury is not allowed to hear about the emotional trauma caused by the
[1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:08.960]  mass murderer who killed the children they are only allowed to hear how their trauma was caused
[1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:15.760]  by the words of alex jones and during jury selection not a single juror thought the media
[1:04:15.760 --> 1:04:23.520]  has ever treated alex jones or info wars unfairly and any juror who questioned the 100 million dollar
[1:04:23.520 --> 1:04:29.920]  amount casually discussed by the plaintiff's lawyers were kicked off the jury alex jones was
[1:04:29.920 --> 1:04:36.160]  canceled from social media in 2018 and is now being canceled from the us bill of rights and
[1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:43.040]  constitution and because of our complacency everyone else is next and in case you were wondering
[1:04:43.040 --> 1:04:49.840]  the way we used to do justice was a thing called innocent until proven guilty it relied upon the
[1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:58.960]  burden of proof and it was pretty good reporting for info wars this is greg reese the globalist
[1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:04.800]  great reset or the war for the world is here but humanity is not being caught flat-footed because
[1:05:04.800 --> 1:05:10.880]  of info wars and because of your support ladies and gentlemen it is now more important than ever

[1:06:02.560 --> 1:06:13.920]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex
[1:06:13.920 --> 1:06:18.880]  jones well well-known pundit constitutional lawyer and one of the smartest guys i know when it comes
[1:06:18.880 --> 1:06:23.520]  to history robert barnes is with us today i've got to go back down to the show trial of the history
[1:06:24.800 --> 1:06:28.720]  well the show trial century definitely but here in america unprecedented even
[1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:33.040]  mike sirvitch is a lawyer said he looked at he's never seen anything like it in us history
[1:06:33.920 --> 1:06:38.400]  robert barnes is here with us he's going to be getting into the huge fbi whistleblower information
[1:06:38.400 --> 1:06:42.160]  that came out about how they're trying to launch a war against the american people we already knew
[1:06:42.160 --> 1:06:47.520]  that with the different information coming out about oh it's terrorized to go to your school board
[1:06:47.520 --> 1:06:52.800]  and you know criticize critical race theory or drag queen pedophile time robert's going to be covering
[1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:59.520]  all of that and and and so much more coming up and we're also going to be hitting on the un the wf
[1:06:59.520 --> 1:07:04.560]  saying banned private ownership of cars that's now official not just banned the beef we have
[1:07:05.600 --> 1:07:09.920]  berks coming out and saying yeah they do the shot never works so what is trump going to do about that
[1:07:09.920 --> 1:07:14.000]  now that he has owned advisors a minute was a fraud he has to decouple from them now and say
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:19.280]  he was lied to that's the only thing really hurting trump that's the big sin he's committed my view
[1:07:19.280 --> 1:07:25.840]  and we're gonna be getting into all of that but barnes first off you've been watching this trial
[1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:30.080]  that kicked off monday they call a trial they're trying to hide from the media the media works
[1:07:30.080 --> 1:07:34.560]  with them they're trying to hide from the jurors that a judge found me guilty not a jury of my
[1:07:34.560 --> 1:07:39.920]  peers she calls it a special case she's been trying to block anything coming in even stuff that was
[1:07:39.920 --> 1:07:44.720]  put in to discovery years ago things was put in weeks ago as evidence she's now playing dumb and
[1:07:44.720 --> 1:07:51.600]  saying we can't put in clips where i said sandy cook happened nine ten years ago so they can
[1:07:51.600 --> 1:07:55.200]  misrepresent i have a right to say it didn't happen i believe that but it shows we were putting
[1:07:55.200 --> 1:08:00.480]  out a lot of different ideas and views i mean this this is just unbelievable no doubt i mean it's a
[1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:05.040]  complete joke of a of justice in texas and in america because what's happening already had a
[1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:09.520]  complete denial of due process of law your right to bring motions to dismiss your right to bring
[1:08:09.520 --> 1:08:13.760]  motions for summary judgment your right to bring slap motions your right to bring appeals of those
[1:08:13.760 --> 1:08:19.120]  motions and any denial thereof then you've been denied the right to trial by jury on the substantive
[1:08:19.120 --> 1:08:24.160]  merits of the case and now you're being systematically denied your right to present any evidence
[1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:29.600]  concerning your own case about the very limited issues she's allowing the jury here while she's
[1:08:29.600 --> 1:08:34.240]  allowing the jury to hear a bunch of inflammatory evidence that has nothing at all to do with the
[1:08:34.240 --> 1:08:38.160]  case because the judge has said we're only here for damages well if we're only here for damages
[1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:42.160]  then ninety percent of the evidence that's come in shouldn't have come in on behalf of the plaintiffs
[1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:45.840]  but to the degree she's going to allow that evidence there's something called the rule of
[1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:50.480]  completeness what what does that mean for those folks out there's rule 106 in the federal rules
[1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:55.840]  of evidence i use it a lot in the snipes case it means you can't take one excerpt out of a
[1:08:55.840 --> 1:09:02.160]  statement out of a letter out of a comment out of a article out of a broadcast and exclude the context
[1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:08.160]  in which that comment is made and here their entire premise of the case is that alex jones is solely
[1:09:08.160 --> 1:09:13.120]  and wholly responsible for all of the pain ever suffered by anybody connected to sandy hook the
[1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:18.160]  exculpatory evidence proves that's utterly false completely false proves that in fours and alex
[1:09:18.160 --> 1:09:22.960]  jones covered every aspect of this case that 99.9 percent of what they covered said sandy hook
[1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:28.080]  happened and in fact there isn't evidence that the individual suffered injury from these words
[1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:32.480]  as is revealed in the fact they never sought retractions corrections or apologies at the time
[1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:38.000]  but you apologize even before that and yet here they're not allowing any of that evidence in why
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:43.200]  why is the if the judge ruled as you know two days ago when he read a news article alex jones
[1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:49.120]  apologizes before they sued me she goes that is stricken he's not allowed to say that to the jury
[1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:53.280]  exactly the jury's not allowed to know that you said that sandy hook happened and that most of info
[1:09:53.280 --> 1:09:57.440]  wars said that over and over and over again over a seven-year time period they're not allowed to
[1:09:57.440 --> 1:10:02.480]  know that the real reason they're suing is simply asking questions that's most of their legal theory
[1:10:02.480 --> 1:10:06.400]  of their lawsuit if you go back and listen to the deposition and the democrats admit this is a blueprint
[1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:10.960]  to ban everybody yes exactly like alex baron said came out and attacked anybody who is defending
[1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:15.200]  you yesterday because he misunderstands and misapprehends the facts he didn't exercise his
[1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:20.240]  core duties of of due diligence as a journalist because if you knew the facts the actual theory
[1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:25.840]  of this case is to create a legal safe space that if somebody challenges the government narrative
[1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:32.400]  on any major event that there's somebody within a zone of emotional danger is offended by you
[1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:37.120]  disagreeing with the government narrative they can now sue you into oblivion if alex baron said
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:40.960]  and paid attention to the legal theory the plaintiffs are trying to use this case to establish
[1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:46.240]  precedent they know they could sue him into oblivion because of what he has said dissident
[1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:50.320]  information so the press is getting rid of its own protections completely i mean what they're
[1:10:50.320 --> 1:10:55.200]  banking on is that this will only be used to target so-called heretics i call it the return
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:11:00.800]  of the heresy trials in america that this is an effort and they assume that it will be gate keep
[1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:05.520]  in such a way that the institute let me look at the covington case the judge dismissed a bunch of
[1:11:05.520 --> 1:11:10.800]  nicolas sandman's cases yesterday against a bunch of media outlets on the grounds that it wasn't a
[1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:15.120]  specifically enough statement made about a specifically identified individual under the
[1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:19.920]  constitutional colloquium requirement and i never said these people's names exactly they said sandman's
[1:11:19.920 --> 1:11:25.280]  name correct they said his name they identified him by image where he went to school exactly i never
[1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:30.560]  said any other names no exactly and they go mr jones for 10 years stalked these people we have
[1:11:30.560 --> 1:11:33.840]  videos the first four years he thought it happened later he questioned it later he said he thought
[1:11:33.840 --> 1:11:38.400]  it happened we're not allowing that in exactly they don't want the context to be presented they want
[1:11:38.400 --> 1:11:43.680]  a caricature of alex jones it'd be like if martin Luther king was writing a letter which he did
[1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:49.280]  and then he quoted what a kkk leader said and then they went look martin Luther king's pro kkk
[1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:53.280]  and martin Luther king's like no read the whole letter completely it's why the rule of completeness
[1:11:53.280 --> 1:11:58.480]  exists the rule of completeness exists to prevent uh the jury from coming to an incorrect conclusion
[1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:03.440]  about what was actually so why is the judge doing this because under texas code they were showing
[1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:09.120]  they said it was over in his opening statements he said he's guilty he owes 150 million he did this
[1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:13.920]  and they said he totally violated state law they said it's over on appeal but who knows uh yeah
[1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:18.560]  there i mean what she said about defamation law was a lot i mean it was a flat out lie libel law
[1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:23.280]  in texas very clear you can use an apology as a right to mitigate damages by the way this is
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:28.960]  common law throughout the country why because we want to encourage and incentivize people to give
[1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:34.080]  apologies plus corrections it gets even worse they never sent a retraction correct i mean they never
[1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:37.440]  request their retraction ever request their correction they never did so until the very
[1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:43.280]  eve of suit and here she's denying the jury hearing all the facts so they want the the plaintiff's
[1:12:43.280 --> 1:12:49.520]  lawyers made up fictional fabricated version of events to be the only set of events they hear
[1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:53.280]  it's basically completely gagging the defense you can hear the plaintiff's side you can't hear the
[1:12:53.280 --> 1:12:57.680]  and it gets worse i i don't even really chew gum i might have a stick of gum once a month i should
[1:12:57.680 --> 1:13:02.400]  do it more it's good for your teeth you know it's if it's a low sugar one or whatever i'm just sitting
[1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:07.840]  there this morning totally not even paying attention she goes are you chewing gum are you chewing gum
[1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:13.280]  just to get that in the news right i mean that's insane i mean this is a liberal authoritarian
[1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:17.440]  judge who has no business having being on the court she lied to get elected i mean she told
[1:13:17.440 --> 1:13:22.160]  people she would treat everybody fairly give everybody a full hearing in her courtroom she
[1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:27.040]  lied she lied to get elected uh it's not a big surprise but you see her authoritarian tendencies
[1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:31.600]  in the courtroom judges with her temperament are precisely the kind of people who should never
[1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:35.760]  be judges in america and people are getting to witness it in live time but she's so scared of
[1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:40.320]  what people will witness that she's exclusively monopolizing who can publish and broadcast it
[1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:44.080]  well that's right they couldn't give me a trial so they said i was guilty now they're trying to rig
[1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:50.080]  the the damages portion absolutely and then she doesn't want the world to see what she's up to
[1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:54.720]  so you're not allowed to keep saying to the jury this is a very special case he's guilty the jury
[1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:59.920]  the jury we learned we have the videos in the jury for dire most people are asking well i thought
[1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:04.240]  i get to choose if he's guilty exactly because that's america right to trial by jury established
[1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:08.480]  back in the magna card that was the whole point in principle that's an eight century old principle
[1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:12.080]  in american and anglo-sac and we know the democrats have been pushing to get rid of jury
[1:14:12.080 --> 1:14:16.960]  trials that's been a big push of the american bar association and now this is it alex shows the
[1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:21.040]  test case if you can take a jury trial from alex shows everybody else follows exactly like some
[1:14:21.040 --> 1:14:24.240]  people get confused and they say oh there's a default judgment and exception to write the trial
[1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:28.400]  by jury didn't show up that's not true yeah it's not true at all no the in fact the reason why
[1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:34.720]  default judgments are generally not allowed in america is because of the right to trial by jury
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:39.520]  not by judge and this judge is someone who if she had confidence in what she was doing she let
[1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:43.920]  anybody clip or rebroadcast her the the court proceedings she's not that's it she said i made
[1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:47.520]  today she said i may just end the live broadcast then no one surprised me at all it's because she's
[1:14:47.520 --> 1:14:53.280]  terrified at the fact that the we talked to the phone last night for 10 minutes we you predicted
[1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:57.680]  she'd probably cut the feed she said she made a day oh absolutely because she was already deleting
[1:14:57.680 --> 1:15:02.560]  videos like i had lawyers who wanted to follow the case viva fry was wanting to figure out where
[1:15:02.560 --> 1:15:06.320]  it was and all of a sudden the videos of the trial are disappearing and i'm going to leave and you're
[1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:09.760]  going to take over now well we'll do one more segment but but i don't want to just harp on me
[1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:13.520]  all day we got a lot of other news to cover but you predicted it in our little i looked at my
[1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:17.680]  phone i hung up it was like a 11 minute conversation i'm like wow barns says she'll probably cut the
[1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:22.240]  feed she said i may just cut the feed imagine she wants one feed so she can say what she wants
[1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:26.080]  but then doesn't want it because she doesn't want people looking at what she's done exactly she
[1:15:26.080 --> 1:15:30.560]  doesn't want there's a public right to access the trials in the old days our trials were publicly
[1:15:30.560 --> 1:15:35.360]  held proceedings she doesn't want the public to see what she's up to because it's such a travesty
[1:15:35.360 --> 1:15:40.800]  and tragedy of justice but she did it first now she's going whoa what did i do we're gonna come in

[1:20:37.760 --> 1:20:41.520]  that it was all a fraud didn't work just incredible stuff coming up with robert marns today i'll go
[1:20:41.520 --> 1:20:48.880]  back down to the show trial of the century but they have done stuff like put up a meme
[1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:55.040]  that was on the show once we just flashed stuff up constantly a beetle juice i've been on the
[1:20:55.040 --> 1:21:00.080]  howard stern show many times before he turned against me and i've been on the show with beetle
[1:21:00.080 --> 1:21:04.720]  juice well beetle juice is a funny comedian so they put a picture up that we put up a beetle
[1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:09.280]  juice and said look why does alex hate black people so we're not allowed to bring any of our
[1:21:09.280 --> 1:21:14.640]  evidence in what does this have to do with the trial that that beetle juice but but but that's
[1:21:15.280 --> 1:21:20.160]  that's the kind of stuff that went on yesterday ladies and gentlemen but imagine they agree
[1:21:20.800 --> 1:21:25.280]  and they have the emails and everything and the judge agreed to the videos that banks that was
[1:21:25.280 --> 1:21:32.080]  going to play we could play but the judge ruled that most of the videos that he plays only pieces
[1:21:32.080 --> 1:21:37.600]  of we can't play the whole thing and her excuse was i haven't been able to watch them all anybody
[1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:41.600]  that knows the law knows that's pure fraud i'm not even a lawyer and i know that but but here's
[1:21:41.600 --> 1:21:49.040]  about 5 30 last night after the jury had left and my main lawyer and eno right now is saying okay
[1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:52.880]  well here's the videos we're going to play tomorrow it was his turn and they said we didn't agree to
[1:21:52.880 --> 1:21:58.160]  that and he gets a little bit angry here's the video right here man my space i came up to talk to you
[1:21:58.160 --> 1:22:02.880]  will you talk to me and you know will you talk to me will you talk to me will you talk to me
[1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:12.560]  are all your videos on this summary exhibit and we're agreeing to all hey guys maybe now's not
[1:22:12.560 --> 1:22:20.960]  the time then we can cool off you know we'll call okay anything you're gonna say no no i i'm just i'm
[1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:25.280]  just gonna tell you can tell him then we might have a fight and if we didn't mark you for this phone
[1:22:25.280 --> 1:22:30.000]  number i don't know we're having a fight right now why your phone number down so we can get it
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:37.200]  we'll call you everybody cool down a little bit on both sides exactly why i'm trying to get you
[1:22:37.200 --> 1:22:44.880]  okay no you can give me your phone number federica i don't want to talk to you anymore
[1:22:55.440 --> 1:23:00.160]  so he gets mad because right before that they're telling the judge no none of this is admissible
[1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:04.720]  we didn't agree even the judge had already agreed the level of this they don't want us to have anything
[1:23:04.720 --> 1:23:09.520]  we had one exhibit they said no to that no exactly i mean it's a complete mockery at every level of
[1:23:09.520 --> 1:23:14.560]  any aspect of an impartial trial i mean again even show trials try to make a show of it these
[1:23:14.560 --> 1:23:19.040]  show trials are a complete mockery and a complete embarrassment to the rule of law to give an example
[1:23:19.040 --> 1:23:23.120]  one the parties agreed to something before trial they do that so that they don't have to worry about
[1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:27.760]  evidentiary objections during trial that appeared to have been done here but and oh he had the emails
[1:23:27.760 --> 1:23:32.400]  he produced today yeah exactly the unsurprisingly the plaintiff's lawyer lied in my experience
[1:23:32.400 --> 1:23:38.320]  he's a hopeless profligate liar utterly unreliable a mental freak the i mean the way he got to law
[1:23:38.320 --> 1:23:42.000]  school was that he had a free ticket to the nut house and the uber driver dropped him off the wrong
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:48.240]  place so that's who he is and so it's unsurprising but what is still shocking to some degree is a
[1:23:48.240 --> 1:23:54.480]  court being complicit in this process being so one-sided being so partial being so prejudicial
[1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:58.720]  is to not allow any of the merits and again if the alex baronsons of the world and the rest of them
[1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:04.960]  were right about this case why is the plaintiff's lawyers why is the court so scared for the jury
[1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:09.600]  to hear all the evidence and let's expand on that my lawyers and a bunch of lawyers i've talked to
[1:24:09.600 --> 1:24:14.480]  have never seen someone not call the plaintiffs call the person they're suing they've not called me
[1:24:14.480 --> 1:24:19.440]  they've not subpoenaed me obviously i'll testify on my side next week what are they scared of
[1:24:19.440 --> 1:24:23.600]  exactly i mean you would think i mean you're supposed to be the living great satan is supposed
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:29.600]  to be the devil the demon in actual public presence you would in almost every case like this you would
[1:24:29.600 --> 1:24:34.960]  be eager to put the defendant on the stand but they know that they've told a lie it's not alex jones
[1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:39.760]  that's on trial it's the caricature the media caricature of alex jones it's on trial and in
[1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:45.200]  order to sustain that illusion they need to have only evidence that supports their caricatured
[1:24:45.200 --> 1:24:50.960]  version of alex jones because the real alex jones the real evidence the real live time videos the
[1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:55.760]  real live time documents disprove their theory of the case it's the whole reason why the court and
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:24:59.920]  the plaintiffs beg for a default in the first place because the evidence they claimed exist just
[1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:04.400]  doesn't exist because their theory of the whole case was always wrong that's how it started in
[1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:09.680]  connecticut first with a sanction was they said gibbacher sandy hook marketing we didn't we hardly
[1:25:09.680 --> 1:25:13.600]  ever covered it we don't have like a news article we don't have marketing with an article we'll cover
[1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:18.800]  monkeypox there's not like a meeting about marketing with it news is one thing products that we think
[1:25:18.800 --> 1:25:25.520]  are popular work well or another and it's too but the judge said no i'm sanctioning you you have it
[1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:29.680]  and then that started the whole thing going and really yeah i mean at every level at every level
[1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:34.960]  again the i mean when people say oh you defaulted that's just ludicrous the find a any i challenge
[1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:41.360]  anybody out there to find one other case where anybody participated in as much discovery as alex
[1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:46.080]  jones is the thing the national headlines are failed to show up i've done like 14 depositions
[1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:51.120]  you've you worked on the case what have we given them oh given more than anybody ever has you gave
[1:25:51.120 --> 1:25:55.760]  him all the email that came into your junk email so i mean you're talking about ordered that exactly
[1:25:55.760 --> 1:26:01.360]  millions of pages of documents emails your own personal private text personal private financial
[1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:05.040]  oh they called up and harassed joe rogan off our text completely i mean he says one thing after
[1:26:05.040 --> 1:26:09.600]  the x i mean it's the most invasive they called joe rogan off the what we gave him exactly and
[1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:14.000]  how would they know some of the information they're knowing uh that they're talking about in court
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:18.560]  unless you produce they're showing emails they're showing text while they say we never gave him
[1:26:18.560 --> 1:26:23.440]  anything exactly they're able to exactly give them videos that are bait stamp they say that's not in
[1:26:23.440 --> 1:26:28.480]  evidence exactly i would say it's because he thinks the cameras are done right well and he's got
[1:26:28.480 --> 1:26:32.400]  away with it the media's only told one side of the story the court only wants one side of the
[1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:36.960]  story to be told so the world can't know the truth is it safe to say it's blowing up in their face
[1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:41.440]  ultimately it will yes it's it's damaging the court of public opinion because if everything you'd
[1:26:41.440 --> 1:26:47.280]  heard bad about alex jones was true they would be eager for all of the evidence to come forward
[1:26:47.280 --> 1:26:51.840]  they would be eager for a trial by jury to hear and let's expand what's this hundred and fifty
[1:26:51.840 --> 1:26:56.080]  million dollar number uh because again i don't have a two million dollars to put into this
[1:26:56.080 --> 1:27:00.400]  so what is that about just to make it just sound outrageous there well this is part of their
[1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:05.440]  the reason why they had to do a fake story is they're saying that there's 75 million americans
[1:27:05.440 --> 1:27:10.240]  that have doubts about sandy hook and that the only reason any of them have doubts about sandy
[1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:13.920]  hook is solely and wholly because he said that word for what he said every one of these 75 million
[1:27:13.920 --> 1:27:18.880]  it's because of him how do you prove that and then because they question i'm guilty well exactly
[1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:22.880]  there's two major problems with it well three major problems one is data is wrong he's misstating
[1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:27.360]  what the data is but secondly what they're really doing is just asking questions but third is you
[1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:32.240]  are not primarily responsible for why people had doubts about sandy hook you you followed what other
[1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:35.760]  people were covering trying to criminalize that questions and but that's why they can't let the
[1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:39.200]  truth out if they let the truth out everybody knows their whole premise is false their whole
[1:27:39.200 --> 1:27:44.400]  story is false their whole caricature is in fact a caricature and they lose they lose in the court
[1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:48.160]  of law they lose in the court of public opinion but this is them attempting to get rid of jury

[1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:05.120]  was ahead of this not only that he kind of explained it they're just in this huge revolution
[1:34:05.920 --> 1:34:11.360]  against choice and free will and normal technological development and adoption of
[1:34:11.360 --> 1:34:17.520]  technology that empowers humanity instead they want adoption of technology forced adoption
[1:34:17.520 --> 1:34:22.880]  world IDs global social credit scores carbon taxes that that dominate and monitor every
[1:34:22.880 --> 1:34:29.680]  facet of our lives you make the case of what the not just the new world order is but using this
[1:34:29.680 --> 1:34:35.840]  great reset to really take up there's whole idea of control and authoritarianism they have decided
[1:34:35.840 --> 1:34:41.520]  to trigger a controlled collapse and then bring in a new dark age to control the general public
[1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:47.440]  where they will be in their elysium fields there is no new technology coming in they're blocking
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:52.800]  that and so really they're just imploding things under the cloud and pivot model show that they
[1:34:52.800 --> 1:34:57.600]  can get that control over us alex jones cuts to the heart of the matter he has presented
[1:34:57.600 --> 1:35:03.520]  tons of valid evidence and facts that i think have been really really important to raising
[1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:11.440]  consciousness through what this sort of technocratic global elite really want to do the true thing that
[1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:17.360]  you've done which is stunning if you look at the evidence of that and the facts you are one of the
[1:35:17.360 --> 1:35:22.960]  great thinkers of this that is very rare you got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation

[1:35:56.080 --> 1:36:01.920]  going to be talking about a range of topics including whether donald trump will sue the cnn for the
[1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:07.120]  various lies and libel's they've been telling now for years whether or not the biden administration
[1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:13.760]  has a credible case to try to indict president trump whether the continued weaponization of our
[1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:19.840]  legal system will lead to the criminalization of innocent conduct content around the world not
[1:36:19.840 --> 1:36:23.840]  only in terms of the freedom of press and the freedom of speech but the freedom of association
[1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:30.960]  and political expression as well but first let's look at a major another fbi whistleblower disclosure
[1:36:30.960 --> 1:36:37.200]  that was brought forward by congressman jim jordan today if you go all the way back to the end of
[1:36:37.200 --> 1:36:44.560]  the cold war the fbi's first effort to create a domestic extremism movement that it could then
[1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:51.120]  use to legitimate and justify invasive powers of surveillance various misuse of prosecutorial
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:57.040]  resources bigger and fatter and broader budgets in a post cold war era which the russia could no
[1:36:57.040 --> 1:37:01.840]  and so the union could no longer be used as the predicate to justify those invasive surveillance
[1:37:01.840 --> 1:37:07.600]  powers or that expansive budget well you just go back to pat con pat con was something that was
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:14.160]  hidden for decades pat con was where the fbi was creating its own militia to help inspire a militia
[1:37:14.160 --> 1:37:19.920]  movement in the united states that it could then turn around and demonize to justify invasive
[1:37:19.920 --> 1:37:25.520]  surveillance powers political suppression of dissident speech and thought and excess budgets
[1:37:25.520 --> 1:37:31.760]  well it has come out today that a similar kind of activity is taking place at the fbi again
[1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:36.960]  that the fbi has been told by the biden administration lie everyday fbi agents that they
[1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:43.280]  have to dummy up and drum up cases of so-called domestic extremism even when they don't exist
[1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:50.480]  as what's supposed to happen is a crime is reported or uncovered in the fbi investigates what is not
[1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:55.520]  supposed to happen is the fbi creating the crime in the first place what is not supposed to happen
[1:37:55.520 --> 1:38:00.720]  is the fbi going out there and looking to do a check in the box like a speeding ticket cop
[1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:05.120]  like oh i gotta meet my quota this week i gotta get 30 speeding tickets so i better go out there
[1:38:05.120 --> 1:38:09.280]  and find somebody i can nail with a speeding ticket that's effectively what's happening at
[1:38:09.280 --> 1:38:14.720]  institutional levels within the federal bureau of investigation and it has gotten so egregious
[1:38:14.720 --> 1:38:21.600]  and so bad that multiple fbi agents have stepped forward and come forward to congressman jim jordan
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:27.520]  and others and blown the whistle on this justice department corruption and political collusion
[1:38:27.520 --> 1:38:32.160]  taking place at the biden justice department basically saying hey go out there and even if
[1:38:32.160 --> 1:38:38.400]  a case isn't domestic extremism call it domestic extremist extremism label it domestic extremism
[1:38:38.400 --> 1:38:46.240]  this explains the desire to tag innocent political first amendment con uh conduct as illicit criminal
[1:38:46.240 --> 1:38:53.600]  domestic extremism because fbi agents are under major pressure to dummy up and drum up fake cases
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:59.040]  of domestic extremism in order to meet their performance metrics in order to be able to
[1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:06.400]  keep their job or to get boosted up and promoted through the hierarchy so that disclosure by
[1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:11.280]  uh congressman jordan today is just further evidence of the complete and utter uselessness
[1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:15.760]  that the federal bureau of investigation has become it has become thoroughly completely
[1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:21.520]  politically weaponized at the very top hierarchical level and that has in effect corrupted
[1:39:21.520 --> 1:39:28.480]  everything beneath it this follows the disclosure earlier just this week that the fbi illicitly
[1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:35.040]  suppressed and improperly closed the hunter biden laptop case that in fact what happened was that
[1:39:35.040 --> 1:39:41.600]  the fbi agents knew of the laptop knew of its authenticity knew of its legitimacy knew of the
[1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:47.600]  criminal conduct it exposed you're talking about daily crimes in america you're talking about
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:53.760]  complicity and participation in human trafficking you're talking about massive drug abuse you're
[1:39:53.760 --> 1:39:58.800]  talking about illicit possession of drugs you're talking about major bribery you're talking about
[1:39:58.800 --> 1:40:04.640]  felony gun charges you're talking about crime after crime after crime after crime after crime
[1:40:04.640 --> 1:40:12.320]  being done day by day by day by day by day by someone who clearly almost wants the world to know
[1:40:12.320 --> 1:40:19.440]  how completely messed up his life is how he has become a criminal reprobate because it indicts
[1:40:19.440 --> 1:40:25.600]  by implication his father and that doesn't even get to the biggest crimes listed in the various
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:31.920]  items on the laptop and in the latest leaks it shows continuous bribery going on continuous
[1:40:31.920 --> 1:40:37.520]  money laundering going on involvement in with illicit intelligence services in places like
[1:40:37.520 --> 1:40:43.680]  china and russia and elsewhere you're talking about extensive criminal conduct that endangers the
[1:40:43.680 --> 1:40:49.360]  national security of the nation beyond the blackmail file that's available if anyone ever had access
[1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:54.640]  to it or was part of those various honey traps or drug traps or anything else that was present
[1:40:54.640 --> 1:41:00.160]  you have admissions you have communications you have conversations you have documentation you
[1:41:00.160 --> 1:41:06.320]  have financial actual financial transactions with a pattern that goes back to then vice president
[1:41:06.320 --> 1:41:11.840]  and now president joe biden and so that comes out that they knew it was legit they knew it was real
[1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:17.840]  but what did the fbi do the fbi closed the file claiming it was russian disinformation that it
[1:41:17.840 --> 1:41:23.920]  was fake and leaked that to the press in order to suppress that story from coming to fruition
[1:41:23.920 --> 1:41:28.880]  now who did all of this happen under it all happened under attorney general william bar
[1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:33.840]  we were one of the uh info wars was one of the few places to raise questions and doubts and
[1:41:33.840 --> 1:41:40.240]  skepticism about attorney general bar pointing out that bar's history was his dad was the headmaster
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:46.400]  who put and hired uh jeffrey eppstein in the first place it was william bar's father who gave jeffrey
[1:41:46.400 --> 1:41:50.960]  eppstein accessed underage girls at the very beginning when he didn't even qualify for the job
[1:41:50.960 --> 1:41:55.760]  it was william bar's father who wrote very interesting books about sexual misbehavior
[1:41:55.760 --> 1:42:00.720]  towards underage girls while he was a headmaster of a school with underage girls and then of
[1:42:00.720 --> 1:42:05.680]  course william bar got his big break working for poppy bush and covering up the cia's illicit
[1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:10.720]  activities and destroying files and committing other illicit acts on behalf of the bush family
[1:42:10.720 --> 1:42:15.920]  in the central intelligence agency right during the mid 1970s when they were under major inquiry
[1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:20.800]  from the church committee and others in congress then of course it was bar who helped cover up a
[1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:26.480]  wide-ranging corruption when he was the attorney general under poppy bush himself including ties
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:31.760]  to noriega money laundering drug trafficking etc so it shouldn't come as any surprise that it was
[1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:36.960]  attorney general bar that was presiding over the fbi when all of this was happening nor should it
[1:42:36.960 --> 1:42:41.760]  shock us that biden has accelerated it but what should shock us and disturb us is that it's happening
[1:42:41.760 --> 1:42:47.040]  at the scale and the scope and the speed that it is when we come back will biden indict trump
[1:42:47.040 --> 1:42:52.240]  does he have credible charges will trump sue cnn will trump finally start to fight back

[1:47:18.240 --> 1:47:22.960]  later on we'll be discussing whether or not biden and the dc grand jury have enough evidence
[1:47:22.960 --> 1:47:29.760]  to indict donald trump or whether it is entirely trumped up charges without merit also whether
[1:47:29.760 --> 1:47:36.160]  not trump will sue successfully cnn for defamation and libel for the litany of false statements they
[1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:41.840]  have made over the years but first other disclosures from the freedom of information act and whistleblowers
[1:47:41.840 --> 1:47:49.360]  about the role of the cdc in colluding with big tech to censor dissident voices according to the
[1:47:49.360 --> 1:47:54.480]  published reports and the email some of which i've seen published at justin heart published by
[1:47:54.480 --> 1:47:59.760]  america first legal which is a steven miller's organization that has brought some good litigation
[1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:04.880]  in the country some successful litigation to be distinguished from the american first policy
[1:48:04.880 --> 1:48:09.920]  institute which is basically a war mongering institute backed by big oil money the america
[1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:15.040]  first legal by steven miller is an organization that is dedicated to actually improving the
[1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:19.840]  legal well-being of ordinary americans in the country they made a freedom of information
[1:48:19.840 --> 1:48:25.360]  act request and by the way for anybody out there you too anyone can make a request under the
[1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:30.080]  freedom of information act for any particular information that you want if you want to know
[1:48:30.080 --> 1:48:34.960]  what the government knows about you what records they're keeping about you you can request through
[1:48:34.960 --> 1:48:39.840]  the freedom of information act as well as the privacy act a range of information that's in
[1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:45.280]  the government's files appealing to specific government agencies that may have your information
[1:48:45.280 --> 1:48:49.840]  you can get all of the information the internal revenue service has on you you can get all the
[1:48:49.840 --> 1:48:55.920]  information the fbi has on you you can get the information the cia has on you now of course
[1:48:55.920 --> 1:49:00.560]  alex jones's file would probably be too long for him to ever read at all but you can actually get
[1:49:00.560 --> 1:49:05.280]  that information yourself as part of the process so remember that there are ways you don't need a
[1:49:05.280 --> 1:49:10.400]  lawyer to do it you don't have to be a lawyer to do it any ordinary american can request this
[1:49:10.400 --> 1:49:15.600]  information including information about other people historical figures public figures ongoing
[1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:21.280]  public controversies that's what happened here america first legal made a request for information
[1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:28.640]  about what exactly was the center for disease control the cdc doing in terms of its interactions
[1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:35.600]  and communications and conversations with big tech with google with facebook with youtube with
[1:49:35.600 --> 1:49:41.120]  twitter and with social media giants like snapchat and others and that's what they requested just
[1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:47.200]  give us what you've communicated to those agencies within a certain time frame about any topic
[1:49:47.200 --> 1:49:52.880]  concerning censorship or conversation well some of those files have now been released and disclosed
[1:49:52.880 --> 1:49:59.040]  and now divulge to the world at a range of places across the internet and what we see
[1:49:59.040 --> 1:50:05.920]  is that there has been extensive collusion between the cdc and the fda and big tech
[1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:11.760]  to censor and suppress dissident voices in the social media space this is in fact part of
[1:50:11.760 --> 1:50:17.440]  robert kennedy's and the children's health defense lawsuit against facebook currently
[1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:22.240]  pending before the ninth circuit court of appeals they documented and demonstrated how
[1:50:22.240 --> 1:50:27.840]  there had been targeted censoring algorithmic manipulation outright misrepresentations about
[1:50:27.840 --> 1:50:33.680]  chd children's health defense and robert kennedy in the process because of their independent
[1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:39.440]  information warning about the risk of lockdowns warning about the risk of vaccines warning about
[1:50:39.440 --> 1:50:44.480]  the risk of all of our pandemic policy responses and how they could harm not only children but
[1:50:44.480 --> 1:50:49.600]  americans across the age spectrum well this information shows that in fact the center
[1:50:49.600 --> 1:50:56.560]  for disease control and prevention coordinated with social media companies and google to censor
[1:50:56.560 --> 1:51:02.960]  users and that was not just censor commentators not to censor media sources to censor users
[1:51:03.520 --> 1:51:12.640]  who expressed any skepticism or criticism of covet 19 vaccines according to a trove of
[1:51:12.640 --> 1:51:19.520]  international of internal communications obtained by america first legal and shared in this particular
[1:51:19.520 --> 1:51:25.280]  instance with the washington beacon over the course of the last six months starting in december
[1:51:25.280 --> 1:51:32.960]  of 2020 not coincidentally right after our election fornication in november of 2020 cdc
[1:51:32.960 --> 1:51:40.000]  officials regularly communicated with personnel at twitter facebook and google over quote vaccine
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:47.600]  misinformation at various times cdc officials themselves would flag specific posts by users
[1:51:47.600 --> 1:51:53.120]  just users ordinary people on social media platforms such as twitter as quote unquote
[1:51:53.120 --> 1:52:01.280]  example post to make an example of in one email to a cdc staffer a twitter employee said quote
[1:52:01.280 --> 1:52:07.280]  he is looking forward to setting up regular chats with the agency other emails show the
[1:52:07.280 --> 1:52:14.640]  scheduling of meetings with the cdc but and these various social media giants over how to
[1:52:14.640 --> 1:52:21.920]  monitor speech related to covet 19 vaccines indeed the efforts to police information also resulted
[1:52:21.920 --> 1:52:27.680]  in absolutely admitted mistaken acts of censorship of course any act of censorship is mistaken by
[1:52:27.680 --> 1:52:34.080]  definition indeed the question is why isn't big tech held liable part of this is because of section
[1:52:34.080 --> 1:52:39.840]  230 and its misapplication and misappreciation by the court system as just as thomas has
[1:52:39.840 --> 1:52:46.000]  repeatedly identified and noted this is because big tech treats itself as immune thanks to the
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:51.600]  courts buying into the idea that section 230 of the communications decency act passed all the way
[1:52:51.600 --> 1:52:59.280]  back in 1997 related to allegations concerning the wolf of wall street no less were of a kind in
[1:52:59.280 --> 1:53:06.640]  order to limit all efforts to regulate or govern or discipline or hold accountable big tech
[1:53:06.640 --> 1:53:12.800]  traditionally in in america uh any person who breaches their contract who makes a promise to
[1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:18.720]  you but then breaks that promise sometimes called promissory estoppel if they do so under equitable
[1:53:18.720 --> 1:53:24.640]  relief or they make a promise to you that they get to induce you to participate in their product
[1:53:24.640 --> 1:53:30.960]  called fraud in the inducement all of these things are actionable either under contract law
[1:53:30.960 --> 1:53:37.120]  tort law or equitable law yet none of those state claims are allowed against big tech why
[1:53:37.120 --> 1:53:43.680]  because big tech has read the because the big courts have reinterpreted section 230 to say
[1:53:43.680 --> 1:53:49.200]  that anything big tech does is beyond the reach of the law they're just completely and utterly
[1:53:49.200 --> 1:53:56.880]  immune now this is as just as thomas has noted a complete incorrect uh assessment of section 230
[1:53:56.880 --> 1:54:02.160]  and the supreme court of the united states itself has never landed clarity to this area
[1:54:02.160 --> 1:54:08.640]  critically needing it which means we need congress in the new congress come 2022 and definitely come
[1:54:08.640 --> 1:54:17.040]  2024 with a new presidency to rewrite section 230 to make clear that any immunity is conditioned on
[1:54:17.040 --> 1:54:23.120]  big tech complying with first amendment principles i was in a debate recently with a lawyer uh friend
[1:54:23.120 --> 1:54:28.560]  of mine from the left who didn't understand why it is that i supported first amendment principles
[1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:33.440]  being applied to big tech and the reason is this the argument it goes all the way back to the us
[1:54:33.440 --> 1:54:38.640]  supreme court dealing with company towns back in the old days you had these companies would own the
[1:54:38.640 --> 1:54:44.480]  whole town and consequently they could prohibit people from organizing to support unions organizing
[1:54:44.480 --> 1:54:50.000]  to support other workers organizing to oppose the company at any level whether it's in its
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:55.120]  economic policy financial or political policy it also was a way to scam the workers overcharge the
[1:54:55.120 --> 1:54:59.680]  rents overcharge the food because you run the whole town and the only person you can complain to
[1:54:59.680 --> 1:55:05.360]  is the company sheriff not your sheriff and so in order to deal with that issue the question was
[1:55:05.360 --> 1:55:10.720]  when a company owns the public square has a monopoly over the public square do you still
[1:55:10.720 --> 1:55:15.600]  have a first amendment right of expression association press and speech into petition
[1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:22.400]  your government in that context the us supreme court said yes you do that when a private entity
[1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:29.840]  has a monopoly over the public square then the first amendment must apply to that private monopoly
[1:55:29.840 --> 1:55:35.360]  the same principle was applied by the california supreme court in a case called prune or there you
[1:55:35.360 --> 1:55:40.800]  had a private shopping mall and in the public square section of the private uh uh the private
[1:55:40.800 --> 1:55:46.080]  mall people often got together to petition for candidates and causes of their choice
[1:55:46.080 --> 1:55:50.400]  then the malls decided to start limiting it and the california supreme court said no you can't
[1:55:50.400 --> 1:55:55.760]  do that under the same principle that had been established by the us supreme court before which
[1:55:55.760 --> 1:56:02.080]  is that when you have a monopoly on the public square a private monopoly on the public square
[1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:09.680]  converts that square into a constitutionally protected square for speech my argument is simple
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:15.040]  the first amendment shouldn't apply to everybody out there in terms of private citizenry and
[1:56:15.040 --> 1:56:20.400]  private companies it should only apply to those private companies that have a monopoly on the
[1:56:20.400 --> 1:56:26.160]  public square that is uniquely in what is a monopoly does it mean a hundred percent no historically
[1:56:26.160 --> 1:56:32.400]  in american law monopoly is just 70 percent or more of that particular space well twitter has
[1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:38.160]  70 percent or more of that particular space google has 70 percent or more of that typical
[1:56:38.160 --> 1:56:44.720]  of that space same with youtube same with facebook indeed on average it gets to the level of 95 percent
[1:56:44.720 --> 1:56:50.640]  is the degree of monopoly they hold over the public square in that context we should take the same
[1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:56.320]  premises the same principles the same precepts the us supreme court applied previously the california
[1:56:56.320 --> 1:57:02.640]  supreme court applied in prune yard and say that big tech when they choose to monopolize the public
[1:57:02.640 --> 1:57:09.680]  square is subject to the same first amendment limiting principles as is any other company town
[1:57:09.680 --> 1:57:15.680]  because these are de facto company towns the digital public square and big tech space have
[1:57:15.680 --> 1:57:21.520]  become the company towns of today and we must protect freedom and liberty in that context
[1:57:21.520 --> 1:57:27.120]  but it's going to require a conscientious court to do so when we come back does biden have enough
[1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:32.240]  evidence to indict trump or will it be as much of a kangaroo court as the case is in alex jones

[2:00:30.720 --> 2:00:35.840]  with george gammon and others in particular senator manchin and the democrats and senator

[2:01:44.160 --> 2:01:52.000]  current issues on our agenda we tend to forget that we are in the midst of the forced industry
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:59.280]  revolution which accelerates global change in much more comprehensive and faster ways
[2:01:59.280 --> 2:02:06.640]  than the previous three revolutions the objective is to quickly recognize the potential of new
[2:02:06.640 --> 2:02:16.480]  technologies history is truly at the turning point we do not yet know the full extent and the systemic
[2:02:16.480 --> 2:02:26.320]  and structural changes which will happen however we do know that global energy systems food systems
[2:02:26.320 --> 2:02:33.440]  and supply chains will be deeply affected and as bloomberg gleefully reported key democratic
[2:02:33.440 --> 2:02:38.720]  congressional allies are urging president joe biden's administration to support a new injection
[2:02:38.720 --> 2:02:44.960]  of resources for countries at the imf to help them deal with the fallout from russia's invasion of
[2:02:44.960 --> 2:02:52.400]  ukraine to the tune of at least 650 billion in additional imf reserve assets the demand is
[2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:59.120]  being led by representative promilla jaya paul and senator elizabeth warren zero hedge recently
[2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:06.240]  put the puzzle pieces together concerning the democrats proposed 650 billion dollar flooding
[2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:15.040]  of the imf with special drawing right funds what are special drawing right funds the special drawing
[2:03:15.040 --> 2:03:22.400]  right or sdr was created by the imf in 1969 to supplement the official reserves of its member
[2:03:22.400 --> 2:03:29.760]  countries the sdr is an interest bearing international reserve asset that can only be held by the imf
[2:03:30.320 --> 2:03:36.400]  its member countries and designated official entities known as prescribed holders in addition
[2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:42.320]  to this role the sdr serves as the unit of account of the imf and several other international
[2:03:42.320 --> 2:03:48.880]  organizations zero hedge writes each new crisis brings global banks closer to their goal the
[2:03:48.880 --> 2:03:56.080]  introduction of national digital currencies and the sdr basket become the de facto reserve trading
[2:03:56.080 --> 2:04:04.400]  tool for the world why do democrats specifically want aid denominated in sdr's because funding
[2:04:04.400 --> 2:04:10.880]  allocations in the u.s. have already hit their maximum and new funding bills are being defeated in
[2:04:10.880 --> 2:04:18.080]  the senate at the imf there are no checks and balances they can ask for almost any amount
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:24.320]  of money in the form of sdr's without oversight there are always strings attached when it comes
[2:04:24.320 --> 2:04:32.400]  to the imf and in exchange for sdr's the globalists will certainly want more centralized control the
[2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:38.640]  ukrainian war is not merely a money laundering operation it is a linchpin to transfer the global
[2:04:38.640 --> 2:04:44.880]  economy out of the money printing of central banks and directly into the hands of globalists
[2:04:44.880 --> 2:04:51.920]  controlling the imf we are being looted in real time of our property currency sovereignty and our

[2:06:18.480 --> 2:06:23.920]  being implemented what's truly horrifying is we know what their battle plans call for in the next
[2:06:23.920 --> 2:06:29.920]  phase a 90 percent forced depopulation of the planet they have recruited an army of control
[2:06:29.920 --> 2:06:36.960]  freaks and pedophiles and scum and criminals of every sort to build their new world order army
[2:06:37.840 --> 2:06:41.200]  and they have the big private central banks and they're funding they have the corporate media
[2:06:41.200 --> 2:06:46.800]  they have most of the courts but they don't have our hearts our minds and they don't have control

[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:12.720]  welcome back to the alex jones show this is robert barnes guest hosting a little bit later
[2:08:12.720 --> 2:08:16.800]  we'll be discussing whether or not biden has sufficient evidence to actually indict trump
[2:08:16.800 --> 2:08:23.040]  or whether it's simply a bluff and whether or not the state of georgia may be bringing charges
[2:08:23.040 --> 2:08:28.800]  under the politically motivated district attorney there in folton county but first up an answer
[2:08:28.800 --> 2:08:35.520]  to alex baronson alex baronson was on twitter the other day suggesting that anyone who defended
[2:08:35.520 --> 2:08:41.200]  alex jones should be ashamed of themselves and that he will be blocking them my response was
[2:08:41.200 --> 2:08:46.240]  that alex baronson should feel ashamed for even making such a statement given his own issues and
[2:08:46.240 --> 2:08:51.360]  concerns with fundraising and other related matters if you have a log in your eye don't go around
[2:08:51.360 --> 2:08:58.080]  looking for the spec in other people's eyes alex baronson's response was to buy into the entire
[2:08:58.080 --> 2:09:03.680]  media narrative that the case has nothing to do with the first amendment has nothing to do with
[2:09:03.680 --> 2:09:09.360]  the constitution has nothing to do with due process of law has nothing to do with trial by
[2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:15.840]  right of jury but that's the problem he simply accepted the media's narrative without looking
[2:09:15.840 --> 2:09:21.280]  at the actual facts for those out there that want the actual facts the actual facts are still the
[2:09:21.280 --> 2:09:28.000]  same alex jones and info wars produced more discovery than any defendant in a media defamation
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:33.760]  case than i have ever heard of indeed you don't have to doubt that because you can simply listen
[2:09:33.760 --> 2:09:39.440]  to what the plaintiffs are talking about in court the emails the documents the text the videos the
[2:09:39.440 --> 2:09:46.640]  financial information and that shows you as well as a wide range of video clip excerpts from depositions
[2:09:46.640 --> 2:09:52.880]  and that tells you huh they said that there was no attempts to meaningfully do any discovery in
[2:09:52.880 --> 2:09:57.680]  the case well if that is the case then how is it they have all of these emails all of these
[2:09:57.680 --> 2:10:04.640]  documents all of these texts all of these depositions in fact in that context if you dig deep and if
[2:10:04.640 --> 2:10:09.600]  you dig further what you will see and what you will witness is extraordinary participation
[2:10:09.600 --> 2:10:15.200]  by info wars and alex jones to an unparalleled and unprecedented degree in discovery discovery
[2:10:15.200 --> 2:10:20.880]  that in my view violated their first amendment right of speech press and association how so
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:25.760]  they demanded that info wars try to turn over disclose various whistleblower reports that they
[2:10:25.760 --> 2:10:30.400]  had received tried to force info wars to disclose what other members of the press they have ever
[2:10:30.400 --> 2:10:35.760]  talked to whether it's joe rogan or anyone else demanded they tried to they actually tried to get
[2:10:35.760 --> 2:10:42.160]  the info wars records of info wars consumers and donors and contributors they failed in that effort
[2:10:42.160 --> 2:10:46.240]  due to the effort to object to it but they were able to obtain a wide range of other
[2:10:46.240 --> 2:10:51.520]  financial information about members of info wars that they were not constitutionally entitled to
[2:10:51.520 --> 2:10:56.000]  under first or fourth amendment principles so this is the degree to which they partook and
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:01.760]  participated in discovery alex baronson would know this had he actually done his job had he
[2:11:01.760 --> 2:11:06.320]  actually done a little bit of due diligence and researched and reviewed the actual facts in the
[2:11:06.320 --> 2:11:12.080]  case here by the way is a red flag and you can use it for other cases if you hear somebody has done
[2:11:12.080 --> 2:11:16.960]  something bad within a judicial proceeding that warrants their denial of their constitutional
[2:11:16.960 --> 2:11:22.640]  right or liberty see if they're really specific about what that was here you've heard lots of
[2:11:22.640 --> 2:11:28.320]  stories about how info wars didn't participate in discovery but they never tell you how do they
[2:11:28.320 --> 2:11:32.880]  they never tell you what document was it that wasn't turned over what deposition was it that
[2:11:32.880 --> 2:11:38.000]  wasn't done what information wasn't presented what information did they not ultimately already have
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:42.720]  or obtained by independent third party sources they don't tell you any of that and that's because
[2:11:42.720 --> 2:11:48.160]  they know it's a made up case of discovery non-compliance this has been extraordinary
[2:11:48.160 --> 2:11:53.440]  discovery compliance so in that context this case already violates info wars first amendment
[2:11:53.440 --> 2:11:58.160]  rights because it allows a legal theory of the case to move forward that violates the constitutional
[2:11:58.160 --> 2:12:04.160]  principle of colloquium which requires that you talk about a specific person you identify that
[2:12:04.160 --> 2:12:11.040]  person by image or by name and that you say a specific fact about them not a theory and a factual
[2:12:11.040 --> 2:12:15.680]  item that can be confirmed by a jury if you can't then it's a violation of the first amendment
[2:12:15.680 --> 2:12:19.520]  rights of freedom of the press freedom of the speech and freedom of association and freedom of
[2:12:19.520 --> 2:12:24.400]  expression the freedom to ask questions that's why the right to petition our government is part of
[2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:29.440]  the first amendment so that's first violation the next violation was the second amendment right
[2:12:29.440 --> 2:12:33.600]  because this speech was about your right to defend yourself with the second amendment and the net
[2:12:33.600 --> 2:12:39.520]  includes the right to bear and carry arms as the indiana gentleman did that saved lives as a person
[2:12:39.520 --> 2:12:45.440]  in west virginia did just about a month ago and save lives as happened all across america and saves
[2:12:45.440 --> 2:12:50.320]  lives it was a fourth amendment violation by the violation of the rights to privacy in a wide range
[2:12:50.320 --> 2:12:55.280]  of information just because you've been sued doesn't mean you forfeited your right to privacy you
[2:12:55.280 --> 2:13:00.080]  still have the right to privacy under the fourth amendment that requires the court show and meet
[2:13:00.080 --> 2:13:05.040]  a certain high standard the more intimate or private that information is that right was routinely
[2:13:05.040 --> 2:13:10.080]  inflagrantly violated by the plaintiffs and even the courts in this case the fifth amendment right
[2:13:10.080 --> 2:13:14.960]  is the right to due process of all what does that mean the due process of law entitles you to bring
[2:13:14.960 --> 2:13:20.480]  the same motions to dismiss anti slap motions motions for summary judgment that everyone else
[2:13:20.480 --> 2:13:26.000]  has and yet infores has been denied that right in every single sandy hook case no right to bring
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:31.200]  a motion to dismiss no right to bring a motion under the anti slap laws no right to bring a
[2:13:31.200 --> 2:13:36.480]  motion for summary judgment indeed only one court even heard those motions on the merits
[2:13:36.480 --> 2:13:41.280]  and the texas supreme court passed on getting involved at the preliminary stage when frankly
[2:13:41.280 --> 2:13:45.600]  they could have and should have and likely will regret that they didn't as they see the mockery
[2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:51.200]  and travesty of justice unfolding before our very eyes in travis county texas then you have the sixth
[2:13:51.200 --> 2:13:56.080]  amendment right to confront witnesses against you including those presenting evidence from the other
[2:13:56.080 --> 2:14:01.440]  side in this context that has been routinely and repeatedly denied cross examination by presenting
[2:14:01.440 --> 2:14:06.880]  the full context of videos and documents has been systematically and continuously excluded
[2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:12.880]  by the court even when the other side had agreed to those videos prior to trial indeed alex jones
[2:14:12.880 --> 2:14:17.200]  is not even allowed to tell the jury that he repeatedly said sandy hook happened in many
[2:14:17.200 --> 2:14:21.600]  instances over the years he's not allowed to tell the jury that for the mistakes that he made and
[2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:26.080]  the questions that he asked were that were the wrong questions he has recognized and admitted
[2:14:26.080 --> 2:14:32.560]  and uh accepted responsibility for the things he got wrong unlike cnn unlike the new york times
[2:14:32.560 --> 2:14:37.520]  unlike frankly fox news so in that same context then you get to the seventh amendment right to
[2:14:37.520 --> 2:14:44.320]  trial by jury this is why you cannot just routinely flagrantly dismiss cases and or default witnesses
[2:14:44.320 --> 2:14:49.360]  or exclude a jury from hearing evidence that's because of the right to trial by jury which goes
[2:14:49.360 --> 2:14:54.480]  all the way back to the magna carta itself whether you're talking about eight centuries of history
[2:14:54.480 --> 2:14:59.840]  here folks that's how important this right was because we want to make sure that juries decide
[2:14:59.840 --> 2:15:06.480]  the facts that juries decide the evidence that juries decide the truth not judges not judges
[2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:13.760]  who have political biases and personal prejudices and class uh biases that can shade their perception
[2:15:13.760 --> 2:15:19.280]  of a case that's why you can't issue a default judgment outside of extreme and extraordinary
[2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:26.800]  circumstances that did not exist in this case so the alex jones case is a case to see how many
[2:15:26.800 --> 2:15:32.720]  constitutional rights they can take away they can strip they can violate because if they can do it
[2:15:32.720 --> 2:15:37.840]  to alex jones then you can guarantee just like the social media censorship and suppression that
[2:15:37.840 --> 2:15:44.720]  took place they are coming for you next once again we are all alex jones when we come back

[2:20:19.200 --> 2:20:27.760]  hosting is trump going to be indicted is uh trump going to sue cnn the possibilities of trump getting
[2:20:27.760 --> 2:20:33.600]  indicted continue to mount particularly in the state of georgia and there they are but it appears
[2:20:33.600 --> 2:20:38.320]  that they are paralleling the same structure according to leaks from various fbi and justice
[2:20:38.320 --> 2:20:43.680]  department individuals about a pending grand jury in the district of columbia where there have been
[2:20:43.680 --> 2:20:49.680]  extensive search warrants extensive subpoenas and the rest this by the way shows the difference
[2:20:49.680 --> 2:20:55.920]  between the durham investigation and a real investigation that if durham was serious you
[2:20:55.920 --> 2:21:00.160]  would have heard many search warrants you would have heard of many subpoenas you would have heard
[2:21:00.160 --> 2:21:05.760]  of many witnesses you never did that was a sign that durham was never the real deal he was there
[2:21:05.760 --> 2:21:11.680]  to cover up the degree of corruption at the highest ranks the goal just as moeller was there to cover
[2:21:11.680 --> 2:21:16.960]  up everything that took place involving spy gate durham was the cleanup guy to make sure that anything
[2:21:16.960 --> 2:21:24.480]  that went wrong was sky spy gate was not blamed on john brennan was not blamed on james clapper
[2:21:24.480 --> 2:21:31.280]  was not blamed on people like james comey was not blamed on peter stroke was not blamed on anybody
[2:21:31.280 --> 2:21:37.920]  like that but was instead blamed on low level mid-tier outsiders and then even when then he
[2:21:37.920 --> 2:21:43.680]  brought charges he brought them in cases like the district of columbia where he knew the jury
[2:21:43.680 --> 2:21:50.880]  was likely to acquit just because the defendant was pro uh was anti trump and so the same pattern
[2:21:50.880 --> 2:21:57.440]  has revealed in reverse when it relates to the dc grand jury and the fulton county grand jury going
[2:21:57.440 --> 2:22:04.320]  after trump there have been extensive subpoenas search warrants a wide range of invasive investigative
[2:22:04.320 --> 2:22:10.080]  techniques that show they are desperate scorched earth level desperate to try to find anything
[2:22:10.080 --> 2:22:15.760]  they can use to indict trump but did trump commit a crime well i was part of the trump
[2:22:15.760 --> 2:22:23.120]  election team in georgia and the answer is no the only crime where the crimes he was exposing
[2:22:23.120 --> 2:22:28.240]  not the crimes he partake and participated in it it's important to remember out there on the
[2:22:28.240 --> 2:22:34.320]  election contest context what the president's election contest was all about here they're
[2:22:34.320 --> 2:22:39.520]  claiming the electors are fake electors that's utter hogwash that would be like saying every time a
[2:22:39.520 --> 2:22:44.080]  candidate names electors they're fake electors unless those are the ones that congress ultimately
[2:22:44.080 --> 2:22:50.160]  determines to accept everybody is competing electors those aren't fake electors they're
[2:22:50.160 --> 2:22:56.720]  competing electors that if you win your election contest one remedy can be for a court to appoint
[2:22:56.720 --> 2:23:02.320]  them as the electors also another remedy is for the state legislature to appoint them as electors
[2:23:02.320 --> 2:23:07.600]  and an even another remedy is for congress itself to appoint them as an elect as electors or of
[2:23:07.600 --> 2:23:13.280]  course you could just have a new election you have to name what your competing electors are
[2:23:13.280 --> 2:23:19.440]  to make it easy for courts or congress or state legislatures to give remedy that's all president
[2:23:19.440 --> 2:23:25.040]  trump did all he did was make it easily available and accessible for the courts or congress or
[2:23:25.040 --> 2:23:30.880]  state legislatures to give effective remedy he didn't put forth fake electors these people are
[2:23:30.880 --> 2:23:37.200]  all real the whether or not they were accepted as electors was a question for the courts a question
[2:23:37.200 --> 2:23:42.880]  for congress a question for the state legislatures by definition until the electors were chosen
[2:23:42.880 --> 2:23:50.320]  they could not be legally fake electors that makes the dc grand jury investigation a fake fraudulent
[2:23:50.320 --> 2:23:56.720]  investigation that makes the investigation out of fulton county georgia a fake fraudulent investigation
[2:23:56.720 --> 2:24:02.400]  what it shows is democrats are willing to weaponize all law fair everywhere whether it's
[2:24:02.400 --> 2:24:06.640]  prosecutorial power whether it's state power whether it's federal power whether it's judicial
[2:24:06.640 --> 2:24:12.160]  power whether it's lawsuit power to go after and tar and feather sometimes quite literally
[2:24:12.160 --> 2:24:17.120]  they're political opponents and adversaries well unfortunately republicans and conservatives have
[2:24:17.120 --> 2:24:22.960]  mostly sat on their hands look at hunter biden hasn't hunter biden committed crimes in a whole
[2:24:22.960 --> 2:24:27.920]  bunch of counties in a whole bunch of states all across the country where are the state prosecutors
[2:24:27.920 --> 2:24:34.240]  or county prosecutors stepping up to the plate to make sure he is held accountable for all of his
[2:24:34.240 --> 2:24:42.000]  continuous daily filmed himself selfies cry his his crime selfies that's what biden makes or crime
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:47.120]  selfies on a daily basis why has none of them stepped up to the plate and brought prosecution
[2:24:47.120 --> 2:24:52.720]  while there are these fake fraudulent charges brought against president trump or being investigated
[2:24:52.720 --> 2:24:57.840]  against president trump in georgia and in the district of columbia so the shorty answer is
[2:24:57.840 --> 2:25:02.000]  there is no case against president trump for committing any crime because president trump
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  didn't commit any crime president trump exposed the crime and just as they went through and tried
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:13.520]  to find something in new york the manhattan went through all of his financial history all of his
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:19.040]  personal history all of his professional history looked at everything he's ever done or even possibly
[2:25:19.040 --> 2:25:24.400]  could do and they couldn't find one piece of evidence that donald trump had committed one
[2:25:24.400 --> 2:25:30.480]  single crime they couldn't even reach the low level of probable cause of criminal conduct
[2:25:30.480 --> 2:25:36.320]  to go after him in new york for his entire history in as a businessman in new york as a public figure
[2:25:36.320 --> 2:25:41.840]  in new york and they looked at literally everything they went after people that simply worked for
[2:25:41.840 --> 2:25:47.760]  trump on whether they got all of their t's crossed and all of their i's dotted correctly on minutia
[2:25:47.760 --> 2:25:54.320]  like taxes and they still couldn't find a single thing that trump did wrong if that's the case why
[2:25:54.320 --> 2:25:59.040]  do they think now they're gonna suddenly find something he did wrong this is an attempt to
[2:25:59.040 --> 2:26:05.680]  create a fake narrative around the issue of the election and let's go back to the election remember
[2:26:05.680 --> 2:26:11.120]  what about it was problematic sometimes people get caught up in machines they get caught up in
[2:26:11.120 --> 2:26:16.960]  difficult to prove conspiracy theories you don't have to do that to realize the election fornication
[2:26:16.960 --> 2:26:22.720]  that took place in 2020 did not meet the constitutional standard of a presidential election
[2:26:22.720 --> 2:26:28.000]  what does that mean it means that in order to be constitutionally qualified it needs to conform to
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:34.480]  the rules set by the state legislature and only the state legislature because under the constitution
[2:26:34.480 --> 2:26:39.920]  presidential elections are only determined by the legislative branch of the state government
[2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:46.160]  not anybody else so were there the big questions were threefold were there constitutionally
[2:26:46.160 --> 2:26:51.040]  unqualified voters who voted meaning voters who did not meet the standards under the state
[2:26:51.040 --> 2:26:56.640]  legislature's rules for voting in the presidential election second where their ballots cast they were
[2:26:56.640 --> 2:27:02.160]  not constitutionally qualified ballots what does that mean it means ballots cast in conformity
[2:27:02.160 --> 2:27:08.160]  with the rules set by the legislature of each state third was the canvassing and the counting of
[2:27:08.160 --> 2:27:14.080]  the ballots done in a constitutionally qualified manner once again in accord with the rules and
[2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:18.640]  standards established by the legislature of each state here's the fact that they don't want to
[2:27:18.640 --> 2:27:25.040]  disclose and don't want to talk about in georgia in arizona in wisconsin in michigan in pennsylvania
[2:27:25.040 --> 2:27:32.400]  in arizona in nevada in all of these states there were more constitutionally unqualified
[2:27:32.400 --> 2:27:38.640]  voters more unconstitutionally unqualified ballots and more constitutionally unqualified
[2:27:38.640 --> 2:27:43.600]  canvassing and counting of those ballots then there was the margin of victory in each one of
[2:27:43.600 --> 2:27:49.360]  those states for determining the presidential election winner and all the trump needed was just
[2:27:49.360 --> 2:27:53.520]  a few of those states not all of them and it happened in all of them you want the proof of that
[2:27:53.520 --> 2:27:59.200]  that one singular piece of proof so if anybody else out there and says oh there's no proof there's
[2:27:59.200 --> 2:28:05.600]  that's all made up etc ask them one question name the county or state in any contested election
[2:28:05.600 --> 2:28:12.080]  context for presidential election of 2020 where the state allowed and authorized a full signature
[2:28:12.080 --> 2:28:17.440]  match check in other words match the signatures on the absentee ballot envelopes that came in
[2:28:17.440 --> 2:28:24.000]  in with their confidential secret signature on the voter registration file and is it they do this
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:28.880]  all the time in fact brock who's saying obama got himself elected by using signature match
[2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:34.000]  checks to kick off his opponents guess how many counties and how many states in november of 2020
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:40.320]  or for the november 2020 election did a single signature match ballot check of on any major
[2:28:40.320 --> 2:28:46.720]  election none of them none of them why because they knew they had committed fraud the fraud isn't
[2:28:46.720 --> 2:28:51.200]  what president trump did in the election it was what was done to him in the election when we come
[2:28:51.200 --> 2:29:00.480]  back we'll be discussing that and more globalist great reset or the war for the world is here

[2:33:26.400 --> 2:33:35.920]  man thomas jefferson welcome back to the alex jones show robert barnes guest hosting with us
[2:33:35.920 --> 2:33:40.720]  for the bottom half of the hour is mark robert we're going to be discussing a little bit later
[2:33:41.280 --> 2:33:48.240]  what risk does president trump face is that the happened to robert kennedy in 1968 when
[2:33:48.240 --> 2:33:53.280]  robert kennedy was looking for possible revenge on the deep state for the assassination of his
[2:33:53.280 --> 2:34:00.320]  brother john kennedy uh... you can find mark robert america's untold stories on youtube
[2:34:00.320 --> 2:34:06.560]  can also find them at unstructured dot locals dot com the america's untold stories you find an

[2:34:24.240 --> 2:34:31.440]  century independently investigating what took place in what transpired involving the assassinations
[2:34:31.440 --> 2:34:37.680]  of john that's jerald kennedy as well as the assassination of robert frances kennedy and others
[2:34:37.680 --> 2:34:43.760]  in the context of what took place in the 1960s and 1970s so that is why you should go to america's
[2:34:43.760 --> 2:34:48.560]  untold stories you can get the breakdown on lbj and find out all about jumbo we won't detail that
[2:34:48.560 --> 2:34:54.080]  any further here you can find all about a wide range of information and details there in terms of
[2:34:54.080 --> 2:34:58.960]  what happened to participants because it's a useful template not just if you're interested in curious
[2:34:58.960 --> 2:35:03.680]  in history and you want to know what happened at you know what how did the kennedy assassination
[2:35:03.680 --> 2:35:08.560]  happened who covered it up what happened with robert kennedy what happened was saran saran really
[2:35:08.560 --> 2:35:13.760]  the soul assassin or was there a whole another story as mark has detailed but also look at it
[2:35:13.760 --> 2:35:19.520]  for templates these are the kind of people to look out for in the gray space operators who operate
[2:35:19.520 --> 2:35:25.120]  between the black and the white the david fairies of the world who managed to be both inside and
[2:35:25.120 --> 2:35:30.800]  outside government one foot in both like the guy banisters of the world the clay shaws of the world
[2:35:30.800 --> 2:35:36.960]  and the many other culprits that show up in the kennedy assassination and so that is the context
[2:35:36.960 --> 2:35:41.120]  in which we'll be discussing today some of the lessons that mark has learned in investigating
[2:35:41.120 --> 2:35:47.040]  the kennedy assassination so uh mark glad you could be with us hey great to see you robert
[2:35:47.920 --> 2:35:54.320]  that was great what led to the uh your interest in the first place in investigating what really
[2:35:54.320 --> 2:36:00.560]  happened in the kennedy assassination well i guess i grew up into it i mean when you're a certain
[2:36:00.560 --> 2:36:07.440]  age and you see jack ruby being killed on television sitting there with your parents in
[2:36:07.440 --> 2:36:15.520]  brooklyn and he's killed in a police station in dalis the most least likely place for a suspect
[2:36:15.520 --> 2:36:24.240]  like oswald to be killed by ruby in police custody the most famous perpetrator or you know alleged
[2:36:24.240 --> 2:36:31.120]  perpetrator at the time surrounded by 50 to 60 dalis police officers to have a man come in
[2:36:31.680 --> 2:36:36.880]  a nightclub owner stick a gun into his stomach and blow his guts out and you're sitting at
[2:36:36.880 --> 2:36:42.000]  home from school watching that the same weekend that your president's head has been blown off
[2:36:42.560 --> 2:36:48.640]  in that same city uh you begin to ask a few questions at that time as to why that happened and
[2:36:49.360 --> 2:36:53.600]  you know i mean really like a lot of people the first questions that came up the first answers
[2:36:53.600 --> 2:36:58.800]  were provided by mark lane uh who wrote russia judgment it becomes the number one bestseller
[2:36:58.800 --> 2:37:05.520]  on the new york times bestseller list uh mark lane an attorney in new york and greenidge village
[2:37:05.520 --> 2:37:12.960]  who was actually jfk's democratic uh campaign manager in that area of new york city for his
[2:37:12.960 --> 2:37:20.960]  campaign mark lane comes to dalis and talks to uh oswald's mother and becomes the attorney for her
[2:37:20.960 --> 2:37:26.960]  uh she wants him to represent her son at that time he's already obviously deceased uh but that's
[2:37:26.960 --> 2:37:33.200]  where mark lane begins this journey which leads to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of books
[2:37:33.200 --> 2:37:39.760]  and documentaries about the identity assassination but the point that starts this thing is mark lane's
[2:37:39.760 --> 2:37:47.280]  book reaching number one on the bestseller list and the cia coming out with a memorandum a couple
[2:37:47.280 --> 2:37:54.480]  of years later in 67 saying to their media assets as they call it in the document in the document
[2:37:55.120 --> 2:38:02.320]  that mark lane has to be called a conspiracy theorist that's their new word their new phrase
[2:38:02.320 --> 2:38:08.240]  is conspiracy theorist this is developed because of the success of rush to judgment the book
[2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:17.200]  as well as the documentary robert so the cia creates this phrase for the first time against
[2:38:17.200 --> 2:38:24.880]  an american citizen who has had success with a book and with a documentary but is also digging
[2:38:24.880 --> 2:38:31.280]  into the deep state for the first time in real time because mark lane goes to dalis and interviews
[2:38:31.280 --> 2:38:38.400]  everyone who are witnesses to the tippet slaying and other situations that occurred uh that weekend
[2:38:38.400 --> 2:38:43.840]  and he's really the only one who puts them on film and you mentioned that the cia originated
[2:38:43.840 --> 2:38:49.520]  the term and popularized the term conspiracy theorist purely to discredit those asking questions
[2:38:49.520 --> 2:38:55.280]  and challenging the narrative about the kennedy assassination we have a trial going on in travis
[2:38:55.280 --> 2:39:01.680]  county texas attacking alex jones and you have people like alex baronson saying that it's okay
[2:39:01.680 --> 2:39:06.960]  because people shouldn't be allowed to ask certain questions about murder conspiracies
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:11.920]  and the first thought that came to my mind was what would have happened had they had this legal
[2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:18.080]  weaponization back in the 1960s and could they have sued mark lane into oblivion on the grounds
[2:39:18.080 --> 2:39:22.400]  that you've said something the war and commission doesn't agree with you've said something his famous
[2:39:22.400 --> 2:39:26.800]  book rush to judgment is an indictment of the war and commission you've challenged and contested
[2:39:26.800 --> 2:39:31.840]  the institutional narrative and there's people who let's say they have some emotional tie to somebody
[2:39:31.840 --> 2:39:36.880]  let's say they got tibet's widow for example or somebody that's willing to play ball to bring suit
[2:39:36.880 --> 2:39:41.840]  and say oh my goodness how dare you challenge lee harvey oswald's complicity you've personally
[2:39:41.840 --> 2:39:46.720]  attacked me you've emotionally destroyed me i should be able to sue you in oblivion and it was
[2:39:46.720 --> 2:39:51.120]  a bit of a shock to me to watch people like alex baronson celebrate this as somehow being a good
[2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:57.360]  idea could you talk about how critical it was throughout exposing the truth about the kennedy
[2:39:57.360 --> 2:40:04.480]  assassination that people were able to ask questions without fear of being sued into oblivion well
[2:40:04.480 --> 2:40:09.680]  you know the the suit into oblivion part uh they didn't really have to go to that route what they
[2:40:09.680 --> 2:40:16.480]  did was back then the secret service went to all the local local dallas news stations and asked
[2:40:16.480 --> 2:40:22.640]  and received the actual footage that they had shot uh that was the way of suppressing the media back
[2:40:22.640 --> 2:40:30.480]  then what they did and let's just take the case of parkland doctor uh dr perry who says that uh in
[2:40:30.480 --> 2:40:35.120]  the press conference stands up and says that kennedy is shot through the throat this is an
[2:40:35.120 --> 2:40:42.240]  entrance wound and that's filmed by dsu and all the dallas stations the secret service goes over
[2:40:42.240 --> 2:40:49.200]  to those news stations and asks and receives the footage of pair of dr perry saying that a little
[2:40:49.200 --> 2:40:55.120]  bit more ham-handed robert than what is going on today hamfisted but that's what they did they just
[2:40:55.120 --> 2:41:00.560]  bulldog their way through it back then you know they didn't have to sue anybody the suits that
[2:41:00.560 --> 2:41:08.560]  you're seeing now are because you know obviously the the media censorship which is extremely draconian
[2:41:08.560 --> 2:41:15.280]  today even that is not enough to suppress the truth today you know what i mean even that is not
[2:41:15.280 --> 2:41:22.320]  enough to put a clamp down because i think their biggest nightmare and why we're seeing the the
[2:41:22.320 --> 2:41:30.080]  wizard behind the curtain is the broad width of the internet they cannot get this beast under
[2:41:30.080 --> 2:41:36.480]  control and it cannot and that's why they're going after alex because his millions of followers his
[2:41:36.480 --> 2:41:43.200]  millions of viewers they are trying to take down info wars from what i understand lock stock and
[2:41:43.200 --> 2:41:50.160]  two smoking barrels so it doesn't operate at this level because they can't put this genie back in the
[2:41:50.160 --> 2:41:56.000]  bottle they cannot put a clamp down i'm trying to compare it to how easy it was back then you know
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  the secret service to literally go into w dsu in dallas they give us a goddamn footage bro you know
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:07.680]  what i mean oh absolutely i mean it shows the importance of alex jones and info wars is it's
[2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:13.120]  the best deterrence against deep state malfeasance because of its ability to expose it and thus they
[2:42:13.120 --> 2:42:17.680]  have to come up with new and creative ways to suppress and censor that were unavailable to them
[2:42:17.680 --> 2:42:24.000]  back in the 1930s when we come back after i mean 1960s uh and the 1930s when we come back after the
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:29.120]  break we'll be discussing with mark robert the deep state plot to kill president presidential

[2:48:20.240 --> 2:48:25.040]  dive looked at hundreds of hours of documentaries hundreds and hundreds of books gone through
[2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:29.920]  wide-ranging original source material the best informed person on the kennedy assassination
[2:48:29.920 --> 2:48:34.560]  that i've ever met and you've been detailing little bits and pieces little vignettes of the
[2:48:34.560 --> 2:48:40.960]  story uh at america's untold stories but i think a big part of that story is what followed up in
[2:48:40.960 --> 2:48:48.720]  1968 you testified at the saran saran parole hearing detailing and objecting to his continued
[2:48:48.720 --> 2:48:54.560]  detention and imprisonment and as you've noted in the two-part series on rfk uh his assassination
[2:48:54.560 --> 2:49:02.720]  and in your treatment rfk must die uh the hopefully will be produced soon that the kennedy assassination
[2:49:02.720 --> 2:49:09.120]  robert kennedy was not assassinated by a lone crazy nutman sir the nut nut in the saran saran
[2:49:09.120 --> 2:49:14.960]  as was popularly portrayed and presented in the court of public opinion in that context you
[2:49:14.960 --> 2:49:20.080]  mentioned the relevance and significance of both the fact that the deep state is who assassinated
[2:49:20.080 --> 2:49:26.640]  john f kennedy is that robert kennedy said just i think a couple of days before his assassination
[2:49:26.640 --> 2:49:32.640]  his intention to reopen the uh investigation into his brother's assassination that everybody kind of
[2:49:32.640 --> 2:49:37.760]  knew it was a revenge tour for bobby kennedy that if he got back into the white house he was going
[2:49:37.760 --> 2:49:42.720]  to undo the damage that had been done by the deep state and correct what his brother was attempting
[2:49:42.720 --> 2:49:47.360]  to correct at the time of his assassination unfortunately we never got to see what that
[2:49:47.360 --> 2:49:52.400]  looked like because he was assassinated soon thereafter can you describe for people how
[2:49:52.400 --> 2:49:57.280]  much is the deep state the the best evidence that the deep state is the real culprit for
[2:49:57.280 --> 2:50:02.240]  the assassination of john kennedy and that it was likely deep state operators and affiliates
[2:50:02.240 --> 2:50:06.960]  and associates and motivation that was behind the assassination of his brother robert kennedy
[2:50:06.960 --> 2:50:14.560]  well we were just talking about the other day on the show myself and uh eric hungley how jock
[2:50:14.560 --> 2:50:20.080]  whitney um this is some new revelation i had jock whitney of the whitney new york whitney
[2:50:20.080 --> 2:50:24.960]  museum family on the new york herald furbun for instance just to give you an example of some
[2:50:24.960 --> 2:50:31.200]  obscure little tidbit that people don't realize multi-millionaire owned the uh the tribune in
[2:50:31.200 --> 2:50:37.840]  new york he wakes up on november 22nd 1963 and must have gotten a phone call because he goes to work
[2:50:38.560 --> 2:50:46.400]  and makes himself into a copywriter uh that day and he writes on november 22nd the first
[2:50:46.400 --> 2:50:55.600]  printed editorial uh calling lehar v oswald a lone assassin of jfk in a new york newspaper
[2:50:55.600 --> 2:51:01.200]  now he has never written an article for the new york herald tribune he's the publisher
[2:51:01.200 --> 2:51:07.360]  and owner but he wakes up that morning robert and he has a cup of espresso and he from midtown
[2:51:07.360 --> 2:51:13.040]  madden he walks over to the office and he's and he sits down and he writes the editorial that
[2:51:13.040 --> 2:51:22.000]  becomes the first ever in print uh story that oswald is the lone assassin of jfk now the reason
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:30.720]  that's important is a how fast it was done and b how deep this guy is into the deep state as a
[2:51:30.720 --> 2:51:37.760]  whitney doing it so dig that here's the guy he's a multi-millionaire but he gets a phone call saying
[2:51:37.760 --> 2:51:44.080]  listen jock he's named jock because he owned all these uh horses and was a big horse racing uh
[2:51:44.080 --> 2:51:52.240]  uh fanatic but he's summoned to go to work and write the editorial that is how quickly and how
[2:51:52.240 --> 2:51:58.720]  fast the payback of being a member of the deep state uh it's kind of like the godfather on a
[2:51:58.720 --> 2:52:03.440]  gritty level on a down down several you see it in the godfather you know someday we're
[2:52:03.440 --> 2:52:08.080]  going to come to you the you know the the funeral director and how you're going to have to do
[2:52:08.080 --> 2:52:16.080]  something for us well on a maga scale and i mean that maga meaning can't say not uh trumpian on a
[2:52:16.080 --> 2:52:23.760]  huge scale that's how the deep state works a guy at the level a level of jock whitney of the whitney
[2:52:23.760 --> 2:52:31.360]  museum family could get a call saying buddy you got to go to work today and write this bullshit
[2:52:31.360 --> 2:52:36.800]  that we came up with and this story and he goes oh yeah i'm going over right now now that's just
[2:52:36.800 --> 2:52:43.360]  an example of the deep state in regarding jfk i mean the snuffing out of witnesses i mean having
[2:52:43.360 --> 2:52:48.880]  dulls on the wand commission that's a deep state move it already been you know the arch nemesis
[2:52:48.880 --> 2:52:56.000]  of jfk fired by him so of course the last guy you would want to investigate your murder is the guy
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:53:01.040]  who ran the operation that you fired so that's you know that's crazy right there but we all know
[2:53:01.040 --> 2:53:06.560]  that stuff i mean but what we're getting into now including with you is you know looking at this
[2:53:06.560 --> 2:53:13.120]  thing from a military angle from the military angle of a general charles cabell who's fired
[2:53:13.120 --> 2:53:19.040]  as a second in command of the cia of somebody like a general walker who's a two-star general
[2:53:19.040 --> 2:53:27.040]  in dallas texas who was fired by jfk somebody like kurtis bombs away lemay a four-star general
[2:53:27.040 --> 2:53:34.400]  who was just who despised jfk and said we have to nuke cuba immediately who said repeatedly
[2:53:34.400 --> 2:53:39.360]  that if the japanese had won the war he would have been tried and executed as a war criminal
[2:53:39.360 --> 2:53:45.600]  and rightfully so for killing over 300 000 japanese and the fire bombing of tokyo civilians so
[2:53:45.600 --> 2:53:54.160]  these were the arch nemesis of jfk and rfk the bottom field level people you know the rubies
[2:53:54.160 --> 2:53:59.760]  running around at the street level that's what people get to look at you know the people that
[2:53:59.760 --> 2:54:04.960]  are running around the dirty filthy you know street level cats but up above are these puppet
[2:54:04.960 --> 2:54:11.600]  masters of the deep state robert who have been doing this maybe going back to the 30s and speaking
[2:54:11.600 --> 2:54:16.480]  of which how much risk like people have asked me what's the most analogous comparison to trump's
[2:54:16.480 --> 2:54:22.560]  presidential campaign and like the only time someone was in the presidency and went at the
[2:54:22.560 --> 2:54:28.320]  deep state and was removed uh or wasn't reelected by any means was really john kennedy and the and
[2:54:28.320 --> 2:54:35.280]  robert kennedy's attempts to return that power to the people how much risk does trump have that he
[2:54:35.280 --> 2:54:40.800]  faces a consequence in 2024 or in its approachment if they're not able to indict him if they're not
[2:54:40.800 --> 2:54:46.000]  able to politically take him out that he faces a similar risk of the fate of robert kennedy did
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:55.280]  in 1968 a risk of assassination this way lbj uh worked the same way lbj tried to intimidate he
[2:54:55.280 --> 2:55:01.520]  tried to bribe he would pay you he would pay you to do his bidding he would bribe you to do his
[2:55:01.520 --> 2:55:07.520]  bidding and if none of that worked then he would call up a mac wallis and have you killed uh he would
[2:55:07.520 --> 2:55:14.960]  just say take care of him this is what the way lbj did it so i believe after they're they have exhausted
[2:55:14.960 --> 2:55:21.680]  900 impeachments and indictments against trump we see what happens to elise elden up in upstate
[2:55:21.680 --> 2:55:27.440]  new york they just come at you with a knife i mean this this is a guy running for the republican
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:33.360]  a seat as governor of the state of new york a congressman a united states congressman
[2:55:33.360 --> 2:55:40.480]  he's attacked in broad daylight by a man with a knife who comes inches away from stabbing him in
[2:55:40.480 --> 2:55:48.720]  the throat if not for united states marine who intercedes there um he is then released immediately
[2:55:48.720 --> 2:55:55.840]  without bail i mean this you know is showing you when they're when they're stalking united
[2:55:55.840 --> 2:56:03.840]  states supreme court justices robert like avonoff and and nobody that's an eye you talk about dog
[2:56:03.840 --> 2:56:09.360]  whistles they're they're literally doing it a different way now they're sending out a mad
[2:56:09.360 --> 2:56:14.480]  dog whistle as i call it you know they're not hiring a guy you know with a resume they're just
[2:56:14.480 --> 2:56:21.360]  sending out a broad net but if that broad net doesn't work then you've got to get into a a sirhan
[2:56:21.360 --> 2:56:28.960]  feign gene caesar plot that can be rather complicated but i'm sure there's a bunch of these on the
[2:56:28.960 --> 2:56:35.040]  board that are ready to go against trump because he like alex jones have become these lightning
[2:56:35.040 --> 2:56:41.600]  rods of truth in the american zeitgeist in the american pop culture in american history
[2:56:41.600 --> 2:56:48.160]  and they will apparently go to any length to stop jones and to stop trump from getting back into
[2:56:48.160 --> 2:56:54.080]  power because they know that these guys are coming for them if they get back into power
[2:56:54.080 --> 2:57:02.560]  you know what i mean like kennedy like you said he spoke in in march of 1968 right here in the valley
[2:57:02.560 --> 2:57:08.400]  at which now uh northridge university he said that he for the first time and he had never
[2:57:08.400 --> 2:57:13.520]  said this before many of the kennedy aides uh documented this that if he's elected president
[2:57:13.520 --> 2:57:19.200]  he was going to reopen the investigation into his brother's uh murder exactly in just a week
[2:57:19.200 --> 2:57:24.640]  and less than a week or so later he was dead thanks mark uh for joining us you can follow him at

[3:00:02.560 --> 3:00:11.040]  hey everybody jason bermas here in for alex jones in the fourth hour and over the next
[3:00:11.040 --> 3:00:19.280]  60 minutes or so we are going to be discussing the historical significance of the bohemian grove
[3:00:19.280 --> 3:00:29.440]  which by the way is taking place right now right now with zero media coverage whatsoever
[3:00:30.240 --> 3:00:38.960]  within the context of not only the military industrial complex former and a i assure you
[3:00:38.960 --> 3:00:48.320]  you there are arms deals bills digital currency deals and food deals taking place in the sonoma
[3:00:48.320 --> 3:00:58.240]  redwoods right now but also in the regards of our history in compartmentalization the executive
[3:00:58.240 --> 3:01:05.120]  within the executive the very deep state that robert barnes was just discussing and props to
[3:01:05.120 --> 3:01:13.440]  robert barnes talking about bill bar as a modern day part of that and guess what bill bar just
[3:01:13.440 --> 3:01:22.560]  happens to be in the nappa valley right now giving speeches i wonder if he might stop at the grove
[3:01:23.200 --> 3:01:29.520]  you see once i found out that the manhattan project was hatched there and that's where
[3:01:29.520 --> 3:01:36.000]  compartmentalization was taken to the next level and we started to have these programs
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:43.680]  that were what born classified post world war two which will get into i realized that this was
[3:01:43.680 --> 3:01:50.560]  not only a birthing place for the type of policies that led to technology that can totally
[3:01:50.560 --> 3:01:58.480]  dominate and change the world humanity as a whole but there was also a spiritual aspect to this
[3:01:58.480 --> 3:02:11.040]  and so over the last decade and a half what i've done is i've amassed a slew of their own internal
[3:02:11.040 --> 3:02:18.000]  annals for instance is their sixth annal here 1973 to 1987 and when i talk about the military
[3:02:18.000 --> 3:02:23.440]  industrial complex and i talk about the deep state okay i want you to see this picture right
[3:02:23.440 --> 3:02:30.480]  here well i guarantee his son will be in attendance but right there you have george bush with all
[3:02:30.480 --> 3:02:39.280]  those gentlemen in the middle dressed as spooks remember george bush will become the vice president
[3:02:39.920 --> 3:02:49.760]  of reagan after being the cia director okay and there is zero let me say this again zero
[3:02:49.760 --> 3:02:55.680]  media coverage that this is happening right now on top of that we're going to take you into the
[3:02:55.680 --> 3:03:02.800]  historical spiritual aspect of this as well by showing you a man called george t bramley the
[3:03:02.800 --> 3:03:10.080]  high priest of bohemia this book is his biography as you can see the owls on the boat the owl
[3:03:10.880 --> 3:03:19.440]  is also on the bind and this book is dedicated to the bohemian club in fact i would suspect
[3:03:19.440 --> 3:03:25.520]  that this very copy right here was actually owned by a member of the bohemian grove because
[3:03:26.080 --> 3:03:34.480]  what you're looking at right here is the obituary of bramley and in this book he not only discusses
[3:03:34.480 --> 3:03:43.680]  his meeting with john d rockefeller but he describes the ritual for neophytes or initiates
[3:03:43.680 --> 3:03:52.880]  into the bohemian club as he is the high priest he also discusses other aspects of the occult and
[3:03:52.880 --> 3:04:00.720]  rituals via druids as techs and others so this is an important topic we're going to hit several of
[3:04:00.720 --> 3:04:05.520]  the annals and that biography we've got eight annals here folks i don't know that there's
[3:04:05.520 --> 3:04:12.480]  anybody outside of the club itself that has as much of this historical information and let's
[3:04:12.480 --> 3:04:18.320]  not forget alex jones is the one that broke the cremation of care wide open we're going to be
[3:04:18.320 --> 3:04:24.880]  describing that ritual in bramley's own words as well we're going to be getting into the great
[3:04:24.880 --> 3:04:30.400]  reset the new world order the technology behind all of this post world war two the good shepherd
[3:04:30.960 --> 3:04:37.680]  top gun maverick believe it or not and so much more so if you want to know this stuff you're
[3:04:37.680 --> 3:04:44.000]  going to have to hang on and we are going to be there shortly but first alex's war it's premiere
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:50.960]  and tomorrow yeah you can preorder the book but can you wait for this documentary right now be sure

[3:06:02.560 --> 3:06:08.880]  and we are back we're talking about the bohemian growth for those that are not familiar with the
[3:06:08.880 --> 3:06:16.400]  growth this is an encampment in sonoma california it's been around for over a century started
[3:06:16.400 --> 3:06:26.800]  in the late 1800s by a bunch of bohemian artisans and as the establishment started to move in
[3:06:26.800 --> 3:06:32.400]  to the coastline they started to take it over and originally there were about 800 members now it's a
[3:06:32.400 --> 3:06:42.720]  little over 3000 but it has been extremely extremely influential in what we know today
[3:06:42.720 --> 3:06:50.000]  and again the modern day deep state in its secrecy models you know they pledge their
[3:06:50.000 --> 3:06:55.600]  allegiance to this we're going to show you a clip from my film invisible empire a new world order
[3:06:55.600 --> 3:07:03.360]  defined where you understand that these people start these things as young men in college via
[3:07:04.080 --> 3:07:09.520]  skull and bones type secret societies right and that's where the occult rituals come in
[3:07:09.520 --> 3:07:16.240]  and their allegiance does and that's actually post world war two and i want people to understand
[3:07:16.240 --> 3:07:23.600]  this where they make the central intelligence agency where that is born and then these guys
[3:07:23.600 --> 3:07:31.760]  are constantly jockeying for the black programs born classified at black sites like area 51
[3:07:31.760 --> 3:07:40.640]  and others we're going to cover all that but first let's get to george t brownley and the long ago
[3:07:40.640 --> 3:07:47.680]  and the later on his own book because historically here what you're looking at on one side are some
[3:07:47.680 --> 3:07:54.080]  of the plays and then you get to see the druidic in front of a buddha and brownley sitting in the
[3:07:54.080 --> 3:08:01.440]  middle himself rituals that take place and when you look at this book here again everything is
[3:08:01.440 --> 3:08:08.800]  dedicated to the bohemian club let's get right up to it okay everything is dedicated to the
[3:08:08.800 --> 3:08:13.760]  bohemian club this this was a huge part of his life throughout these chapters not only is he
[3:08:13.760 --> 3:08:19.280]  telling you how he gets involved and again that meeting with a rockefeller right here mr rockefeller
[3:08:19.280 --> 3:08:24.400]  unhesitantly pronounced him the best man this is one of his good friends that he went to school
[3:08:24.400 --> 3:08:31.520]  with he had ever met and this is also a man that died worth five million dollars after investing
[3:08:31.520 --> 3:08:38.640]  i believe it was what was it 25 000 with rockefeller it's good to know john d rockefeller and be in
[3:08:38.640 --> 3:08:47.040]  business with him all right so they they discuss right here how the high priest of bohemia and
[3:08:47.040 --> 3:08:54.960]  that is george brownley initiates people into the club and who is this is this sir henry
[3:08:54.960 --> 3:09:02.400]  erving yes henry erving and this is his initiation so the high priest says what is his object the
[3:09:02.400 --> 3:09:10.240]  cardinal he desires to know what this is all about let him enter most excellent cardinal
[3:09:10.240 --> 3:09:15.360]  whom have you hear a stranger from a strange land and i know that this is a lot of goofy stuff to
[3:09:15.360 --> 3:09:23.360]  people but this is how they do it um he has passed the ordeal of the election committee in other words
[3:09:23.360 --> 3:09:29.120]  they've nominated him uh he has without one feather dropping then bring forth the paraphernalia
[3:09:29.680 --> 3:09:36.800]  and the sound the gong the owl because that is their deity folks okay the cremation of care ritual
[3:09:36.800 --> 3:09:46.160]  which we're going to read his own account of is a mollic type ball ritual where they burn the effigy
[3:09:46.160 --> 3:09:53.280]  of a body but that symbolizes their soul their very morality their consciousness you know they
[3:09:53.280 --> 3:09:58.480]  might feel bad for some of the things they've done over the last year on behalf of this agenda
[3:09:59.200 --> 3:10:05.360]  and this is very occult i'm gonna go into the artwork one but you can tell again i'm no bible
[3:10:05.360 --> 3:10:13.280]  thumper i'm no christian okay by any means but they have a very anti christian pro pagan pro occult
[3:10:13.840 --> 3:10:20.320]  attitude high priest and all all right and these are these are the deals the owl in the loving cup
[3:10:20.320 --> 3:10:26.080]  resting upon a small table where then placed before the candidate and he was thus addressed by the
[3:10:26.080 --> 3:10:32.400]  high priest again the owl is their deity i will show this in their own annals illustrious neophyte
[3:10:32.400 --> 3:10:36.960]  before you are permitted to know what this is all about you will truly answer the question i'm about
[3:10:36.960 --> 3:10:43.680]  to propound but as your future happiness may be affected by any mistake in your answer i will reply
[3:10:43.680 --> 3:10:49.440]  to it for you the answer being satisfactory the candidate was requested to prepare himself for
[3:10:49.440 --> 3:10:54.880]  the obligation by taking the loving cup in his right hand and placing it in his left hand his
[3:10:54.880 --> 3:11:01.200]  left hand in his trousers pocket as the act of paying for the drink being given to understand
[3:11:01.200 --> 3:11:07.440]  that was a far as true bohemian ever got to paying for anything in other words your money's no good
[3:11:07.440 --> 3:11:15.280]  here we want your allegiance that's what we want we want your secrecy um in this presence of the owl
[3:11:15.280 --> 3:11:21.440]  and this july and august body see end of july early august again bohemian club meeting now
[3:11:22.320 --> 3:11:30.480]  now and no one's reporting on it i hereby pledge my word in this bohemian totty that i will ever
[3:11:30.480 --> 3:11:36.560]  cherish with feelings of delight the high old initiation i am passing through tonight nor
[3:11:36.560 --> 3:11:45.360]  will tell what hath been told uh me for friendship nor for pelt except it to be to someone who knows
[3:11:45.360 --> 3:11:51.280]  how it is himself to the rules and regulations i will rigidly adhere by always drinking champagne
[3:11:51.280 --> 3:11:55.840]  in preference to be in other words i'm going to shut my mouth and i only talk about this thing
[3:11:55.840 --> 3:12:02.480]  with other bohemian grove members i will love each true bohemian where on earthy goes till he
[3:12:02.480 --> 3:12:08.880]  turns up to the daisies as a macy of the toes till death i pledge this as this i truly promise
[3:12:08.880 --> 3:12:13.520]  on the honor of my name and i will do my level best to keep and perform the same should i ever
[3:12:13.520 --> 3:12:18.960]  divulge the secrets i'm permitted here to know may the wind blow through my whiskers when they're
[3:12:18.960 --> 3:12:26.080]  allowed to grow so once again shut your mouth so the cremation of care okay i know it's a
[3:12:26.080 --> 3:12:31.600]  little blown out there for the audience but let's read from this and this is what bromley says about
[3:12:31.600 --> 3:12:38.320]  this all right at the close of the hijinks the ceremony of the cremation of care is solemnized
[3:12:38.320 --> 3:12:44.880]  and it is not easy to conceive of a more solemn ceremony on the top of the hill in the rear of
[3:12:44.880 --> 3:12:50.080]  the hijinks stage are gathered those who do the participate in the cremation and when the sire
[3:12:50.640 --> 3:12:55.440]  declares the hijinks closed he requests the audience to remain seated and the signal is given
[3:12:55.440 --> 3:13:02.080]  for the procession to move the band playing the dead march it's all based in death again look at
[3:13:02.080 --> 3:13:07.520]  skull and bones look at their rituals on tape we're going to play that the devil equals death
[3:13:07.520 --> 3:13:13.680]  death equals the devil the the band playing the dead march is followed by the high priest that's
[3:13:13.680 --> 3:13:19.920]  bromley and the bears of the casket containing the remains of care again their consciousness
[3:13:20.560 --> 3:13:25.200]  then comes the procession bearing torches as they are descend in the windway pathway
[3:13:26.480 --> 3:13:31.600]  lighted by varied colors it is this it is certainly one of the most solemn sites ever witnessed
[3:13:31.600 --> 3:13:37.920]  for nowhere else could be seen such magnificent surroundings as the procession passes the audience
[3:13:37.920 --> 3:13:44.240]  they are all fall in and proceed to the ravine where the funeral pyre has been erected and
[3:13:44.240 --> 3:13:50.640]  after marching twice around the pyre the casket is then deposited there on the band plays a dirge
[3:13:50.640 --> 3:13:57.280]  and the master of ceremonies delivers a short funeral oration then comes the high priest with
[3:13:57.280 --> 3:14:02.720]  his address closing with the soul stirring announcement that karkin care is conquered
[3:14:02.720 --> 3:14:09.760]  and bohemian is bohemia is free then come the torchbearers to apply their torches as soon as the
[3:14:09.760 --> 3:14:16.160]  whole i can't even tell you what that is whatever it is it's a blaze and as the burning blocks fall
[3:14:16.160 --> 3:14:21.360]  asunder the fireworks in the casket then births forth and a magnificent magnificent display of
[3:14:21.360 --> 3:14:26.400]  rockets bombs and roman candles brilliantly light up the ravine and all of its surroundings
[3:14:26.400 --> 3:14:33.680]  okay this is what alex jones captured so here he talks about this so again there's more of an
[3:14:33.680 --> 3:14:38.480]  occult aspect and why do they choose the owl because the owl is a predator it can see in
[3:14:38.480 --> 3:14:45.200]  the nighttime it represents death and destruction in the mezzo-american culture weaving spiders
[3:14:45.200 --> 3:14:51.600]  come not here don't try to screw us among the mid-mid summer hijinks at which i have um
[3:14:51.600 --> 3:14:56.640]  officiated as high priest again i'm the high priest were several upon which i should love
[3:14:56.640 --> 3:15:03.200]  to dilate the buda jinx held the redwoods back of mount uh to malibus and sired by the late
[3:15:03.200 --> 3:15:13.280]  fred m summers the druid jinx jd redding aztec jinx and the high madrid jinx so again it's more
[3:15:13.920 --> 3:15:21.440]  than just this cremation of care ceremony okay and i'm going to show you some of the plays
[3:15:21.440 --> 3:15:29.120]  they do they do know a there's a lot to this but the important thing is that it is geopolitically
[3:15:29.120 --> 3:15:35.520]  rebel relevant and many of these people are bringing in the transhumanist one world new

[3:22:25.280 --> 3:22:30.240]  so we are back i am jason bermas this is the fourth hour of the alex jones show and we've
[3:22:30.240 --> 3:22:38.080]  been going through different annals and aspects of the bohemian club and grove the grove right now
[3:22:38.080 --> 3:22:44.480]  meeting in sonoma california last week of july first week of august and again big
[3:22:44.480 --> 3:22:52.560]  big things get decided at the grove and when you have the central intelligence agency running
[3:22:52.560 --> 3:22:58.160]  operations against their own politicians many of the members do you think any of the blackmail
[3:22:58.720 --> 3:23:05.120]  might be discussed you think any of the arms deals might be discussed i don't know
[3:23:05.920 --> 3:23:12.400]  sure seems that way especially when you have some of the biggest players out there and for some
[3:23:12.400 --> 3:23:19.600]  reason they're into this weird owl deity now i want to show people here i believe this one
[3:23:19.600 --> 3:23:24.800]  isn't quite a hundred years old although i have one a little over the annals of the bohemian club
[3:23:24.800 --> 3:23:35.280]  okay and it's to their tutelary owl deity you can see the owl right here okay and where is it
[3:23:35.280 --> 3:23:43.360]  right here there it is the tutelary deity the owl all right and in this you can actually see
[3:23:43.360 --> 3:23:51.120]  bromley in cartoon form and here he is in his little boat in the corner uh the owl boat riding
[3:23:51.120 --> 3:23:58.560]  across and in his high priest outfit and don't forget this whole occult and technology thing
[3:23:58.560 --> 3:24:04.480]  think about jack parson's think about rockets think about the nazis themselves being in
[3:24:04.480 --> 3:24:11.280]  to the occult there's bromley it all has historical precedence and when we look at this
[3:24:11.280 --> 3:24:18.320]  anal here and this is the eighth anal this is focusing on the artwork of bohemia you see
[3:24:18.320 --> 3:24:24.640]  and hear those themes again and again and they start talking about a guy named haig padigan
[3:24:24.640 --> 3:24:32.640]  and he's the one that constructed the owl okay let's get to that right here okay three time club
[3:24:32.640 --> 3:24:38.320]  president haig padigan among the best known of bohemian art against padigan was one of the west
[3:24:38.320 --> 3:24:44.240]  coast most prominent sculptors his owl shrine at the gross stands as one of the most defining
[3:24:44.240 --> 3:24:52.800]  images of bohemia it is indeed their shrine and in this again they talk about another artist
[3:24:52.800 --> 3:24:57.920]  robert on re and i want to read this because i was trying to find this painting if anybody can
[3:24:57.920 --> 3:25:04.000]  find i'd love to see it whose urban realism and aesthetic flexibility he inherited and transported
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:10.560]  uh to california especially interesting for a bohemian artist was a 1914 painting entitled
[3:25:10.560 --> 3:25:19.440]  greed in which a naked family hung from a cross representing industrial avarice they love that
[3:25:19.440 --> 3:25:26.960]  anti christian anti family stuff even in 1914 and i'm going to read a quote from jack london
[3:25:26.960 --> 3:25:31.040]  a call the wild what he had to say about the artist that hung with these people
[3:25:31.040 --> 3:25:35.120]  because if you're a low-level minion you know clinton eastwood likes to go there he's part of
[3:25:35.120 --> 3:25:41.520]  the club um if you were to say willy brown mayor of san francisco you you might want to be a part
[3:25:41.520 --> 3:25:47.920]  of this because you get a low-key warning on the morning of 9 11 not to fly that day and then you
[3:25:47.920 --> 3:25:55.680]  can you know years later deny it ever happened on camera you know it it has its perks bohemian club
[3:25:55.680 --> 3:26:01.440]  and let me read this uh right here this is from jack london this brings to mind none other than jack
[3:26:01.440 --> 3:26:08.000]  london and his ambivalent views about the club in modern society he expressed conflicting values
[3:26:08.000 --> 3:26:14.880]  and attachments that earlier bohemian figures seem to be able to hold simultaneously perhaps the most
[3:26:14.880 --> 3:26:21.520]  famous bohemian of all london had written in 1907 even then he saw where this was going remember
[3:26:21.520 --> 3:26:28.880]  lady 1800s mostly artisans and then started getting taken over that bromley book i mean you look at
[3:26:28.880 --> 3:26:37.760]  when he he joined same thing as for the artists they merely pander to the little less than ignoble
[3:26:37.760 --> 3:26:45.600]  tastes of the plutocracy huh the plutocracy and if you don't know what plutocrats are they keep
[3:26:45.600 --> 3:26:51.840]  getting richer and you keep getting poorer it's like the definition it's like the oligarchy all
[3:26:51.840 --> 3:26:59.200]  right so even then even then he was aware let's see i want to show you just a couple of the things
[3:26:59.200 --> 3:27:03.120]  in the artwork and then we're going to get into the military industrial complex aspect of this
[3:27:03.120 --> 3:27:07.840]  this looks like something right out of eyes wide shut you want to go to the christmas dinner
[3:27:07.840 --> 3:27:15.440]  that looks great that looks fun and let's see here here they do know you know they they do a
[3:27:15.440 --> 3:27:22.320]  lot of these plays by the way no women uh so the men play the women a lot of them dress in drag
[3:27:23.200 --> 3:27:30.000]  a lot of them were and have been closeted homosexuals that have been compromised people
[3:27:30.000 --> 3:27:36.560]  like denise hasard who's far far worse and i'm not saying that homosexuality homosexuality is
[3:27:36.560 --> 3:27:42.080]  bad here i'm saying that you get compromised when you're running on the conservative party and you
[3:27:42.080 --> 3:27:47.680]  say you're a christian conservative and you have a family denise of course did all those things but
[3:27:47.680 --> 3:27:56.480]  in fact uh he was labeled as a serial child molester by a judge no big deal you know that
[3:27:56.480 --> 3:28:02.800]  ain't never did any time for that either that's not a big deal either right he he just did
[3:28:02.800 --> 3:28:09.200]  15 months and he's an old man in the wheelchair free today and all of these things integrate and
[3:28:09.200 --> 3:28:16.320]  that's why when we come back we're going to play a segment from invisible empire a new world order
[3:28:16.320 --> 3:28:23.040]  defined but we're going to start with some of the biometrics some of the technology that's
[3:28:23.040 --> 3:28:30.320]  emerging on a large scale now before we get into the grove why because it all integrates together
[3:28:30.320 --> 3:28:38.400]  we're going to work in tom cruise lockheed martin and much much more skunkworks the ox cart program

[3:32:47.200 --> 3:32:51.520]  cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because it warns the world of the
[3:32:51.520 --> 3:32:59.520]  globalist plan get the great reset at infoworksstore.com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the
[3:32:59.520 --> 3:33:14.000]  new world order it's alex jones we are back i am jason bermas this is the fourth hour of the alex
[3:33:14.000 --> 3:33:20.320]  jones show we're talking bohemian grove it's going on right now nobody's writing about it i'd love to
[3:33:20.320 --> 3:33:27.200]  see what the list looked like there over the last week and a half or so into the end of this week
[3:33:27.200 --> 3:33:32.960]  or what they're discussing because when you look at this book right here the greatest men's party
[3:33:32.960 --> 3:33:39.280]  on earth it's by john van der z it's kind of tough to get and he was actually allowed in
[3:33:39.280 --> 3:33:44.000]  and let me just read this basically from the beginning the prologue why have the paths of
[3:33:44.000 --> 3:33:50.560]  american men as seemingly diverse as dwight eisenhower and bobby kennedy pat brown and richard nixon
[3:33:50.560 --> 3:33:57.280]  the old earl warren and bob berry goldwater all passed through this one out of the way woods what
[3:33:57.280 --> 3:34:02.400]  it is it that has made the bohemian grove one of the one of the places that the man who has arrived
[3:34:02.400 --> 3:34:09.360]  in american arrives at most important what needs and desires common to us all does the grove represent
[3:34:10.080 --> 3:34:18.720]  power secrecy maybe the desire to help rule the world i don't know i don't know but again
[3:34:18.720 --> 3:34:23.840]  this is a good read and it shows that power structure and how diverse it is and this is
[3:34:23.840 --> 3:34:31.440]  where i want to get to dwight d eisenhower and the modern day military industrial complex that
[3:34:31.440 --> 3:34:37.520]  again was really born out of that model and the technology because we live in a world now
[3:34:37.520 --> 3:34:49.120]  now okay where cloned beagles are being created and gene edited now in the nineties we openly had
[3:34:49.120 --> 3:34:56.800]  the cloning of dolly livestock has been cloned for years if not over a decade publicly in this
[3:34:56.800 --> 3:35:06.240]  country alone but now it's being normalized that crisper tools can be used to mess with life also
[3:35:06.240 --> 3:35:12.640]  we live in a world where not only black helicopters now exist remember black helicopters in the united
[3:35:12.640 --> 3:35:20.000]  states that's who we but now they're being controlled remotely after being retrofitted by darpa
[3:35:21.200 --> 3:35:26.560]  yes the black hawk helicopters have now become drones those of the worlds i mean this is the
[3:35:26.560 --> 3:35:34.400]  world we live in they're rolling out technology they've had for a very very long time and most of
[3:35:34.400 --> 3:35:41.280]  this technology has been beta tested one way or another area 51 operation pay in paperclip the
[3:35:41.280 --> 3:35:46.880]  pentagon's brain and especially first platoon because we're going to be going over how the
[3:35:46.880 --> 3:35:51.600]  biometrics that we're seeing across the world really beta tested during the war on terror
[3:35:51.600 --> 3:35:57.840]  we're going to lead into that through the fear of 9 11 remember that so these books that you're
[3:35:57.840 --> 3:36:06.320]  looking at to me are a must read history lesson on how the continuity of government program
[3:36:07.360 --> 3:36:13.200]  born classified in the military industrial complex got out of control and is what was
[3:36:13.200 --> 3:36:22.800]  warned about by eisenhower himself so let's take it back a step to area 51 and the ox cart program
[3:36:22.800 --> 3:36:31.600]  one of the things i actually liked about top gun maverick is spoiler alert like the very first
[3:36:31.600 --> 3:36:38.160]  scene for the very first plane that he's going to be testing was an ode to the ox cart program it
[3:36:38.160 --> 3:36:46.000]  had the skunk works logo on the back it said lockheed martin on the shift stick okay and tom
[3:36:46.000 --> 3:36:55.280]  lengthy exercises and breathing and being chambers just to fly the aircraft as documented once again
[3:36:55.280 --> 3:37:00.320]  in annie jacobson's area 51 then she gets interested in the fact that wait a minute a lot of these
[3:37:00.320 --> 3:37:05.920]  people were involved in the military industrial complex and things like that yeah it's it's weird
[3:37:05.920 --> 3:37:14.160]  they were nazis and then the the good shepherd hollywood eyes is the fact that skull and bones
[3:37:14.160 --> 3:37:22.400]  comes out of the os s into the cia right whole thing and they do the occult rituals and they dress
[3:37:22.400 --> 3:37:29.920]  in drag and that's the model that's why it's important that's why it's important so let's play
[3:37:29.920 --> 3:37:34.400]  some of this right here and talk about some of that technology my mind one day you're on one
[3:37:34.400 --> 3:37:38.400]  side of the ledger the other day you may be on the other side of ledger biometrics have been
[3:37:38.400 --> 3:37:43.920]  instituted in both afghanistan and iraq where individuals are subject to fingerprint devices
[3:37:43.920 --> 3:37:50.960]  iris scanners and electronic data to screen local residents as well as dna tests this is not familiar
[3:37:50.960 --> 3:37:57.120]  by the way again we do this under the guise on the war on terror because we were exploited by a
[3:37:57.120 --> 3:38:03.040]  thing called cnn syndrome which i'll show you in a minute and now it's coming everywhere this includes
[3:38:03.040 --> 3:38:08.320]  anyone within the populace of a combat zone someone has to go out there with the biometric
[3:38:08.320 --> 3:38:14.320]  registration equipment take your iris scans take your take your scans and get you registered in the
[3:38:14.320 --> 3:38:20.320]  system like that as scary and tyrannical as these systems seem to be none may be as dangerous as
[3:38:20.320 --> 3:38:27.440]  the implantable rfid microchip through various pretenses including terror security and entertainment
[3:38:27.440 --> 3:38:34.080]  the chip has been promoted and integrated into society in 2001 following the 911 terrorist attacks
[3:38:34.080 --> 3:38:38.880]  the jacob's family became the first family to be injected with microchips in front of a live
[3:38:38.880 --> 3:38:45.360]  television audience we have a florida family who are really pioneers in a brave new world they have
[3:38:45.360 --> 3:38:52.640]  volunteered to be the first ever to have microchip identification devices implanted into their body
[3:38:52.640 --> 3:38:59.440]  after 911 i was really concerned with the security of my family in 2004 the fda approved the use of
[3:38:59.440 --> 3:39:06.400]  rfid technology to be implanted into human beings however studies dating back to the 1990s show the
[3:39:06.400 --> 3:39:11.040]  implantable microchip has been linked to cancer and animals but this has not slowed the agenda of
[3:39:11.040 --> 3:39:17.680]  control in barcelona trendies get chips in order to receive vip status at the exclusive faha night
[3:39:17.680 --> 3:39:23.760]  club a simple swipe of the arm get them in without a line and it pays for their drinks too the mexican
[3:39:23.760 --> 3:39:29.440]  government also chipped employees for security measures in 2004 we were interested today to hear
[3:39:29.440 --> 3:39:35.120]  that more than a hundred law enforcement officials in mexico are having microchips implanted in their
[3:39:35.120 --> 3:39:39.840]  arms the chips allow a person to be scanned sort of like a cereal box at the supermarket checkout
[3:39:39.840 --> 3:39:45.520]  mexico's attorney general and 160 of his deputies have had microchips implanted in their arms
[3:39:47.360 --> 3:39:53.040]  it is to provide access at the attorney general to the right people in exclusive areas today aside
[3:39:53.040 --> 3:39:57.280]  from being promoted as a device that can save your life by storing all of your medical information in
[3:39:57.280 --> 3:40:03.760]  it it is being promoted as the next generation tool for video gaming second developer you suzuki
[3:40:03.760 --> 3:40:09.920]  plans on developing gaming technology using implantable rfid he states people that have some sort
[3:40:09.920 --> 3:40:14.560]  of chips in their bodies to be able to keep track of vital signs so it doesn't have to be a scary
[3:40:14.560 --> 3:40:20.560]  thing but you could put a sensor here you know a bit like the matrix as he points to his arm it's
[3:40:20.560 --> 3:40:25.360]  not really something only in the future some people already have them chips in their bodies
[3:40:25.360 --> 3:40:30.320]  suzuki is correct it has never been easier to order a microchip online and implant it under your
[3:40:30.320 --> 3:40:35.840]  skin microchips implanted in your hand arm or shoulder is just the beginning some have already
[3:40:35.840 --> 3:40:41.520]  taken implantable brain chips that may enable the blind to see again the depth to hear and much much
[3:40:41.520 --> 3:40:46.960]  more including the ability to download information directly into the brain and instantly communicate
[3:40:46.960 --> 3:40:53.040]  with anyone in the world creating a worldwide mind it's very interesting so i just want to point
[3:40:53.040 --> 3:40:58.480]  out this film is from 2010 and how much of that has been mainlined and streamlined and really the
[3:40:58.480 --> 3:41:05.360]  very chip type model is like a toy and we're talking about neurolink we have denis buschnell
[3:41:05.360 --> 3:41:11.920]  the author of that future strategic warfare document that i continually go back to because it is
[3:41:11.920 --> 3:41:18.960]  so important so important for people to understand how real this is back in 2001 again talking about
[3:41:18.960 --> 3:41:26.880]  what cnn syndrome so that they could basically exploit the casualties of people for this same
[3:41:26.880 --> 3:41:32.880]  agenda sound like the coveted 1984 nightmare when they talk about things that will monitor
[3:41:32.880 --> 3:41:42.400]  your very bodily autonomy all of your vitals all the time bio nanotech is here it's not going
[3:41:42.400 --> 3:41:48.960]  anywhere in this they also talk about what oh yeah capturing and torturing americans
[3:41:48.960 --> 3:41:53.760]  and living color on prime time terror attacks within the continental united states binary
[3:41:53.760 --> 3:41:59.520]  biological critical infrastructure takedowns cyber attack anybody this document is from
[3:41:59.520 --> 3:42:10.240]  july of 2001 these are the type of things again that are promoted by these people that are at the
[3:42:10.240 --> 3:42:15.760]  very top through compartmentalization through the military industrial complex we were warned about
[3:42:16.400 --> 3:42:22.560]  by eisenhower that was a spiritual battle so when we come back we're going to get to the secret

[3:47:56.160 --> 3:48:00.400]  has put out there and if you're a sentin human being and just watching it you say we've got alex
[3:48:00.400 --> 3:48:04.720]  jones was ahead of this not only that he kind of explained it they're just in this huge revolution
[3:48:05.520 --> 3:48:10.880]  against choice and free will and normal technological development and adoption of
[3:48:10.880 --> 3:48:17.040]  technology that empowers humanity instead they want adoption of technology forced adoption
[3:48:17.040 --> 3:48:22.400]  world ids global social credit scores carbon taxes that that dominate and monitor every
[3:48:22.400 --> 3:48:29.200]  facet of our lives you make the case of what the not just the new world order is but using this
[3:48:29.200 --> 3:48:35.360]  great reset to really take up there's whole idea of control and authoritarianism they have decided
[3:48:35.360 --> 3:48:41.040]  to trigger a controlled collapse and then bring in a new dark age to control the general public
[3:48:41.040 --> 3:48:46.960]  where they will be in their elysium fields there is no new technology coming in they're blocking
[3:48:46.960 --> 3:48:52.720]  that and so really they're just imploding things under the cloud pivot model show that they can
[3:48:52.720 --> 3:48:58.400]  get that control over us alex jones cuts to the heart of the matter he has presented tons of valid
[3:48:58.400 --> 3:49:04.320]  evidence and facts that i think have been really really important to raising consciousness through
[3:49:04.320 --> 3:49:12.080]  what the sort of technocratic global elites really want to do the true thing that you've done
[3:49:12.080 --> 3:49:17.680]  which is stunning if you look at the evidence of that and the facts you are one of the great
[3:49:17.680 --> 3:49:22.480]  thinkers of this that is very rare you got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation
[3:49:23.120 --> 3:49:28.160]  and see that this book the great reset in the war for the world i'm telling you everybody in
[3:49:28.160 --> 3:49:33.440]  america the people that hate alex jones the most have to read this book this is no beetry you're

[3:49:36.640 --> 3:49:44.640]  stuff it's amazing the great reset in the war for the world by alex jones available now on amazon
[3:49:44.640 --> 3:49:54.800]  or in four store dot com we are back it's the final segment of the alex jones show i am jason
[3:49:54.800 --> 3:50:01.200]  bermas and before we get back to this part in invisible empire a new world order defined
[3:50:01.200 --> 3:50:06.080]  that discusses the bohemian grove skull and bones and secrets aside a lot of people argue
[3:50:06.080 --> 3:50:12.560]  jason they're just plays these people are rudy to the good people well let me tell you something
[3:50:13.280 --> 3:50:19.360]  read the franklin cover up or the franklin scandal and one of the darkest accounts of what could
[3:50:19.360 --> 3:50:28.080]  happen to a child allegedly occurs at the bohemian grove and it is worth noting before we get into
[3:50:28.080 --> 3:50:38.000]  this segment that what the daily mail of all places earlier this week did a extensive piece on
[3:50:38.000 --> 3:50:44.960]  the documentary conspiracy of silence which was never released okay never released and
[3:50:45.680 --> 3:50:52.480]  talked about the callboys in the white house lorence king peter citron victims um
[3:50:52.480 --> 3:50:59.840]  um elijah kramer i'm sorry not elijah kramer alisha owens my bad uh troy bonner and of course
[3:50:59.840 --> 3:51:06.160]  paul bonacci that gives that account there's bonacci and they show a picture of citron here
[3:51:06.160 --> 3:51:14.160]  i mean again the darkness if you look at this information the people that supposedly love us
[3:51:14.160 --> 3:51:21.040]  and rule over us there's nothing benevolent about them so let's kick off this clip on their
[3:51:21.040 --> 3:51:30.480]  secret societies the bohemian grove and their significance politicians business leaders and
[3:51:30.480 --> 3:51:34.880]  media figures are often portrayed as pillars of morality while they describe themselves
[3:51:34.880 --> 3:51:40.000]  as christian conservatives nothing could be further from the truth in reality many of the
[3:51:40.000 --> 3:51:44.640]  elite are groomed at a young age to take part in a cult rituals those who attend Yale are
[3:51:44.640 --> 3:51:50.640]  indoctrinated into the order of skull and bones an elite secret society cloaked as a fraternal order
[3:51:50.640 --> 3:51:54.800]  Yale university is 300 years old this year and we're here to visit its campus you would see
[3:51:54.800 --> 3:52:01.440]  that it still has exotic clubhouses which look like tunes where Yale's legendary secret societies
[3:52:01.440 --> 3:52:07.840]  meet their prestige and importance have largely evaporated but the rituals are still a secret
[3:52:08.800 --> 3:52:13.440]  and so when we heard that some enterprising characters had managed to spy on the famous
[3:52:13.440 --> 3:52:20.800]  skull and bone society we couldn't resist skull and bones people say it's a fraternal fraternity
[3:52:20.800 --> 3:52:26.160]  perhaps the reason you'll mock you over the nice horrific screams caught on tape include chance of
[3:52:26.160 --> 3:52:28.400]  the devil equals death death equals the devil
[3:52:31.360 --> 3:52:37.680]  true famous alums include senators john carrey and john chafee to name two cabinet secretaries
[3:52:37.680 --> 3:52:44.320]  such as avril herriman and three presidents william taft george bush and george w bush
[3:52:44.320 --> 3:52:49.920]  who's been reluctant to talk about skull and bones does it still exist the thing is so secret
[3:52:49.920 --> 3:52:54.640]  i'm not even sure it still exists former skull and bones members and current members have been
[3:52:54.640 --> 3:53:04.000]  presidents heads of cia senators heads of business i mean huge huge corporations these people have
[3:53:04.000 --> 3:53:08.400]  the network that brings them to such a position of power that most people could only dream of
[3:53:08.400 --> 3:53:12.800]  bush would run against his fellow bonesmen and distant cousin john carrey in 2004
[3:53:13.520 --> 3:53:17.920]  you both were members of skull and bones a secret society at Yale what does that tell us
[3:53:18.960 --> 3:53:24.160]  not much because it's a secret is there a secret handshake is there a secret code
[3:53:24.160 --> 3:53:29.200]  i wish there were something secret i could manifest 322 a secret number there are all
[3:53:29.200 --> 3:53:34.640]  kinds of secrets then you were both in skull and bones the secret society it's so secret
[3:53:34.640 --> 3:53:39.440]  we can't talk about what does that mean for america the conspiracy theorists are going to go
[3:53:39.440 --> 3:53:48.000]  watch i don't know i haven't seen the web number 322 this you can bet by the way that george
[3:53:48.000 --> 3:53:54.800]  bush is more than likely at the grove so let's get right to it here is the grove we're finally
[3:53:54.800 --> 3:54:01.680]  there folks thumbs it up subscribe and share to everything i do outside of here and by the way
[3:54:02.400 --> 3:54:08.320]  we are fully demonetized on youtube we get kicked off all the time rock bin rumble and pod bean
[3:54:08.320 --> 3:54:14.000]  is where you can find my stuff camp for the powerful and all male gathering in great secrecy
[3:54:14.000 --> 3:54:19.280]  this group was formed in the late 1800s by artists industrialists and politicians
[3:54:19.280 --> 3:54:26.080]  ohemian attendees worship the owl as their deity the aztecs mayans and other natives of meso america
[3:54:26.080 --> 3:54:31.120]  consider the owl a symbol of destruction and death this is why the opening ritual for the club
[3:54:31.120 --> 3:54:36.560]  is the cremation of care during the ritual the effigy of a baby is rode across the water by
[3:54:36.560 --> 3:54:42.160]  the grim reaper and given to a high priest who then tosses it on a fiery sacrificial altar
[3:54:42.160 --> 3:54:48.400]  of a 40-foot owl god it is an earth-based ritual in which care is burned away the conscience
[3:54:48.400 --> 3:54:53.120]  is symbolically cast aside so that they may ignore the pain they have inflicted on others
[3:54:53.120 --> 3:54:58.560]  the advancement of their own agendas with this ceremony called the cremation of care
[3:54:58.560 --> 3:55:04.960]  that begins the uh the uh two-week encampment where the body of dull care symbolizing woes and
[3:55:04.960 --> 3:55:11.040]  concerns is burned on an altar in front of a big owl statue when that ceremony ends they all start
[3:55:11.040 --> 3:55:19.680]  to cheer and yell you have to ask yourself why why it is that somebody would want to do that let
[3:55:19.680 --> 3:55:26.800]  alone these elite people and and that's a great question mark well let me tell you in this last
[3:55:26.800 --> 3:55:36.160]  couple of minutes because these people at the top many of which are generational sociopaths
[3:55:36.160 --> 3:55:47.360]  are not like you and i they look down upon us as commoners and they see themselves as those that
[3:55:47.360 --> 3:55:57.280]  will drive the next evolution of humankind via veiled technology based on their systems of
[3:55:57.280 --> 3:56:06.800]  compartmentalization and achieve what they believe will be godhood as the rest of us that are allowed
[3:56:06.800 --> 3:56:19.520]  to survive are a new servant class that have been genetically changed and merged with machines the
[3:56:19.520 --> 3:56:30.000]  idea that you or i or any of them will ever upload their consciousness into machines is a great lie
[3:56:30.000 --> 3:56:37.120]  it is a great deception and it is a tool that they're using via their media and propaganda
[3:56:37.120 --> 3:56:47.600]  and entertainment to push via their transgender really transhuman movement this is info wars
