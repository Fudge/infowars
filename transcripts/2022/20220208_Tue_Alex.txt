[00:00.000 --> 00:05.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a maximum Red Alert.
[00:05.400 --> 00:09.760]  Vladimir Putin has officially threatened worldwide thermal nuclear war.
[00:09.760 --> 00:12.320]  EVE NATO continues their invasion.
[00:12.320 --> 00:13.320]  Red Alert.
[00:13.320 --> 00:14.320]  Maximum alert.
[00:14.320 --> 00:15.320]  Tune in now.
[00:15.320 --> 00:16.320]  Swear the word.
[00:16.320 --> 00:17.320]  Infowars.
[00:17.320 --> 00:21.760]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:21.760 --> 00:26.720]  The globalists have wanted nuclear war for a long time.
[00:26.720 --> 00:29.440]  Their launch of COVID-19 was just the beginning.
[00:29.440 --> 00:33.960]  Nuclear waging war against the entire planet itself and humanity.
[00:33.960 --> 00:37.320]  It's Tuesday, February 8th, 2022.
[00:37.320 --> 00:39.960]  And this is the most important broadcast we've ever done.
[00:39.960 --> 00:42.240]  Tell everyone you know, tune in now.
[00:42.240 --> 00:47.520]  We must trigger a chain reaction awakening and avert what the globalists are calling
[00:47.520 --> 00:49.220]  World War 4.
[00:49.220 --> 00:57.160]  This is their plan to drive Russia into conflict with the United States.
[00:57.160 --> 01:01.120]  In the capital city of Ottawa, thousands of truckers and others have clogged the city
[01:01.120 --> 01:03.240]  streets for more than 10 days.
[01:03.240 --> 01:06.480]  Ottawa's mayor has now declared a state of emergency.
[01:06.480 --> 01:11.520]  I'm outlining three steps that I believe Doug Ford should be taking right now urgently.
[01:11.520 --> 01:15.560]  I think that we need to declare a provincial state of emergency.
[01:15.560 --> 01:17.720]  This is how serious the situation is.
[01:17.720 --> 01:21.160]  The wheels are absolutely coming off of everything they're doing.
[01:21.160 --> 01:27.000]  John Hopkins, which is a very diverse scientific group and is the preeminent planner for the
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.640]  Rockefeller Foundation of the COVID attacks.
[01:29.640 --> 01:34.160]  The mission of the Pandemic Emergency Board is to provide recommendations to deal with
[01:34.160 --> 01:40.160]  a major global challenges arising in response to an unfolding pandemic.
[01:40.160 --> 01:44.200]  The board is comprised of highly experienced leaders from business, public health and
[01:44.200 --> 01:45.200]  civil society.
[01:45.200 --> 01:50.360]  We could be looking at double the number of cases in one week and 16 times as many in
[01:50.360 --> 01:53.280]  a month if we are not able to stop the spread.
[01:53.280 --> 02:00.080]  There are pockets and significant pockets of the country where vaccines aren't happening
[02:00.080 --> 02:05.160]  because of those, you know, the anti-vaxxers or whatever you want to call them who have
[02:05.160 --> 02:10.200]  made significant headway in trying to convince parents they shouldn't vaccinate children.
[02:10.200 --> 02:12.000]  Do you get mad about it?
[02:12.000 --> 02:13.000]  I push forward.
[02:13.000 --> 02:19.760]  I wouldn't say get angry, but I'm really impatient that we're not moving as fast as I'd like.
[02:19.760 --> 02:26.960]  The subsequent lies and fraud is now covering its ass by the very working group that was
[02:26.960 --> 02:30.160]  heavily involved with Bill Gates planning all this.
[02:30.160 --> 02:37.040]  Coming out the 60-plus page report saying lockdowns are a fraud and have killed more
[02:37.040 --> 02:42.000]  people than the virus and that the economic destruction of it is going to starve hundreds
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.480]  of millions of people to death, which is true.
[02:44.480 --> 02:50.360]  Reuters has come out and endorsed Iver Mecton and its incredible antiviral properties covering
[02:50.360 --> 02:52.600]  your little dirty asses, aren't you?
[02:52.600 --> 02:56.960]  The head of Reuters on the board of Pfizer and his quarterback, the censorship, Jeff
[02:56.960 --> 03:05.720]  Zucker, the America-hating AT&T hatchet man for this country, has now resigned and they
[03:05.720 --> 03:12.000]  always use the fall on the sword excuse of, oh, because he was having a relationship that
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.680]  was inappropriate with somebody that works there.
[03:14.680 --> 03:19.640]  Yeah, the big crime is men and women having sex and God forbid any children come along.
[03:19.640 --> 03:24.440]  It wasn't lying, it wasn't infiltrating groups, it wasn't overseeing the persecution of millions
[03:24.440 --> 03:29.840]  of people that CNN would covertly and overtly target and have de-platformed.
[03:29.840 --> 03:35.040]  Jeff Zucker's departure was shocking to the staff of CNN, but the people who say we're
[03:35.040 --> 03:41.240]  lacking journalism, that we've become an all talk channel, that we've run off and we're
[03:41.240 --> 03:47.200]  all opinions all the time, that Jeff Zucker led us astray, those people aren't watching
[03:47.200 --> 03:50.800]  CNN, they're not watching CNN.
[03:50.800 --> 03:53.880]  They're watching complaints about CNN on other channels that don't know what they're talking
[03:53.880 --> 03:54.880]  about.
[03:54.880 --> 03:59.440]  Joe Rogan's irresponsible, he took horse-market medicine the other day.
[03:59.440 --> 04:05.080]  Now tell me, sir, and don't tell me anything other than this, should there be a war?
[04:05.080 --> 04:08.080]  Yes, there should be a war.
[04:08.080 --> 04:12.120]  Even if you've done, I'd like to see you do that, Joe Rogan.
[04:12.120 --> 04:14.560]  Which sounds great, but not all opinions are created equal.
[04:14.560 --> 04:18.680]  The crime's not defunding the police, the crime's not opening up the violent people
[04:18.680 --> 04:24.840]  out of the prisons and having five-fold homicide and carjacking numbers explode in blue cities,
[04:24.840 --> 04:26.880]  a doubling nationwide on average.
[04:26.880 --> 04:34.320]  The wheels are coming off, the house of cards is collapsing, the New World Order is in deep,
[04:34.320 --> 04:40.800]  deep, deep trouble, they knew their system was going down.
[04:40.800 --> 04:44.840]  You better know these people aren't going to give up and they're going to stage false
[04:44.840 --> 04:49.000]  flags and blame it on people and they're going to go blow up and shoot up black churches
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.600]  and they're going to start war with Russia and they're going to try to gut our economy
[04:52.600 --> 04:56.520]  as fast as they can because they know they're going down and they want to take us down with
[04:56.520 --> 05:01.520]  them.
[05:01.520 --> 05:05.640]  It's out for months, X3 is now back in stock.
[05:05.640 --> 05:09.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing
[05:09.520 --> 05:15.320]  and so many people are deficient in iodine, it's not the soil anymore, most of it the
[05:15.320 --> 05:21.240]  ocean is contaminated, but when you get high quality triiodine, all three of the healthy
[05:21.240 --> 05:26.520]  types together, it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly
[05:26.520 --> 05:27.520]  your immune system.
[05:27.520 --> 05:33.960]  So, X3, the only triiodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available
[05:33.960 --> 05:37.640]  again at 50% off at InfoWarsHore.com.
[05:37.640 --> 05:41.480]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body, it takes about
[05:41.480 --> 05:45.840]  two weeks to get on average, you really need to experience X3.
[05:45.840 --> 05:48.800]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it, but
[05:48.800 --> 05:52.720]  particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing
[05:52.720 --> 05:56.120]  what it does for your body, it's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds
[05:56.120 --> 05:58.440]  the InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[05:58.440 --> 06:28.280]  So again, X3, back at stock.
[06:28.440 --> 06:42.840]  Here we are on the edge of thermal nuclear war.
[06:42.840 --> 06:50.920]  When I saw this quote this morning in the Daily Mail, I had trouble believing it, so
[06:50.920 --> 06:59.360]  I went and searched some of the quotes and found it nowhere else in the western news.
[06:59.360 --> 07:04.240]  So then our crew spent some time and found it in Russian, and we checked it and had it
[07:04.240 --> 07:10.240]  translated and indeed we found a version that has subtitles where Vladimir Putin, the president
[07:10.240 --> 07:17.960]  of Russia, has threatened nuclear war and said within the blinking of an eye, he says
[07:17.960 --> 07:24.960]  you won't have time to blink your eye if NATO continues its Article 5 takeover, I've got
[07:24.960 --> 07:31.600]  the quotes right here in the video, of Ukraine in this proxy war, we're going to basically
[07:31.600 --> 07:32.600]  stop you.
[07:32.600 --> 07:35.800]  He's been very clear, and that's what the troops are there for.
[07:35.800 --> 07:40.240]  He has no intention of invading if they don't take over the country, which the west already
[07:40.240 --> 07:45.560]  has a lot of troops and weapons, and there's been a long time six-year proxy war going
[07:45.560 --> 07:51.360]  on in the east, which is almost 100 percent Russian.
[07:51.360 --> 07:56.080]  So the headlines are all about Russia makes a fool of Macron by denying that Putin agreed
[07:56.080 --> 08:02.080]  to deal.
[08:02.080 --> 08:06.720]  But that's not what the headline really should state.
[08:06.720 --> 08:10.760]  Info wars got the headline right when we took the quote and posted it.
[08:10.760 --> 08:17.640]  Vladimir Putin warns a nuclear war could break out if Ukraine joins NATO.
[08:17.640 --> 08:25.760]  You don't have to believe me though, you can hear it directly from Putin.
[08:25.760 --> 08:29.600]  I'm again going to put this on screen, it's got subtitles for TV viewers, but for radio
[08:29.600 --> 08:34.840]  listeners we're going to start and stop it so that everybody can really get an idea of
[08:34.840 --> 08:37.560]  what's unfolding here because this is a big deal.
[08:37.560 --> 08:41.240]  This isn't invading some Middle Eastern country that doesn't have high-tech weapons.
[08:41.240 --> 08:44.760]  This isn't the regular, globalist operations.
[08:44.760 --> 08:52.160]  This is potentially into the world type stuff that is unfolding right now.
[08:52.160 --> 09:01.280]  So let's go ahead and roll that video of Putin.
[09:01.280 --> 09:03.920]  Take the cube down for me so I can read it please.
[09:03.920 --> 09:09.520]  I've been saying it, but I very much want you to finally hear me and deliver it to your
[09:09.520 --> 09:21.600]  audience in print, TV and online.
[09:21.600 --> 09:32.080]  Do you understand it or not that if Ukraine joins NATO and attempts to bring Crimea back
[09:32.080 --> 09:38.000]  by military means, the European countries will be automatically pulled into a war and
[09:38.000 --> 09:45.920]  conflict with Russia?
[09:45.920 --> 09:56.640]  Of course NATO and Russia, potentials are incomparable.
[09:56.640 --> 10:00.840]  We understand it, but we also understand that Russia is one of the leading nuclear
[10:00.840 --> 10:11.160]  states, and by some modern components it even outperforms many.
[10:11.160 --> 10:14.160]  There will be no winners.
[10:14.160 --> 10:16.640]  I can pause there, back in up to 10 seconds.
[10:16.640 --> 10:24.520]  So we just threatened to use their hypersonic cruise missiles and ballistic missiles.
[10:24.520 --> 10:28.400]  And of course the United States has even stuff more advanced than secret, but the point is,
[10:28.400 --> 10:31.280]  it doesn't matter, it's nuclear weapons.
[10:31.280 --> 10:36.480]  And they've got Russian suicide soldiers with suitcase nukes already in Europe and all over
[10:36.480 --> 10:37.480]  the place.
[10:37.480 --> 10:42.960]  It doesn't matter if space-based systems shoot down the Russian ballistic missiles or submarine
[10:42.960 --> 10:43.960]  launch missiles.
[10:43.960 --> 10:45.040]  It doesn't matter.
[10:45.040 --> 10:47.240]  The nukes are all over the place.
[10:47.240 --> 10:48.880]  Make no mistake.
[10:48.880 --> 10:49.880]  Make no mistake.
[10:49.880 --> 10:53.640]  And the United States has suicide troops as well all over the place.
[10:53.640 --> 10:57.560]  So this is not a good situation, and they're collectively bringing us all towards suicide.
[10:57.560 --> 11:02.120]  Let's go back to Putin.
[11:02.120 --> 11:13.760]  But we also understand, and by some modern components, it even outperforms many.
[11:13.760 --> 11:16.400]  There will be no winners.
[11:16.400 --> 11:24.640]  And you will be pulled into this conflict against your will.
[11:24.640 --> 11:29.760]  We won't even have time to blink your eye when you execute Article 5 Collective Defense
[11:29.760 --> 11:35.440]  of NATO members.
[11:35.440 --> 11:40.480]  But your President Macron, of course, doesn't want this.
[11:40.480 --> 11:51.440]  And I don't want it.
[11:51.440 --> 12:07.600]  And I don't want it, which is why he is here, touring with me for six straight hours.
[12:07.600 --> 12:11.920]  He said torturing me for six straight hours, trying to get him to not go to war.
[12:11.920 --> 12:13.800]  So there you have it.
[12:13.800 --> 12:20.080]  Let's go ahead since I ran through that and read through it, which was a little bit halting.
[12:20.080 --> 12:27.080]  Let's play it unedited, just so it's on record.
[12:27.080 --> 12:54.080]  Let's go ahead since I ran through that and read through it, which was a little bit halting.
[12:54.080 --> 13:19.080]  Let's go ahead since I ran through that and read through it, which was a little bit halting.
[13:19.080 --> 13:29.080]  Let's go ahead since I ran through that and read through it, which was a little bit halting.
[13:29.080 --> 13:39.080]  Let's go ahead since I ran through that and read through it, which was a little bit halting.
[13:39.080 --> 13:49.080]  Let's go ahead since I ran through that and read through it, which was a little bit halting.
[13:49.080 --> 13:59.080]  Let's go ahead since I ran through that and read through it, which was a little bit halting.
[13:59.080 --> 14:09.080]  Let's go ahead since I ran through that and read through it, which was a little bit halting.
[14:09.080 --> 14:19.080]  Let's go ahead since I ran through that and read through it, which was a little bit halting.
[14:19.080 --> 14:29.080]  Let's go ahead since I ran through that and read through it, which was a little bit halting.
[14:29.080 --> 14:39.080]  Let's go ahead since I ran through that and read through it, which was a little bit halting.
[14:39.080 --> 14:50.080]  These are high-level folks who don't like what's happening because they'd rather have businesses and build a future and have families.
[14:50.080 --> 15:02.080]  For the globalists, it's all about world domination, so that's where we are in 2022 on February 8th.
[15:02.080 --> 15:12.080]  The globalist propagandists have set it up where if they continue to attack the Russians and the Russians show footage of how they're being attacked,
[15:12.080 --> 15:19.080]  and as the campaigns escalate, then they will say, oh, it's a fake movie, oh, Russia attacks itself.
[15:19.080 --> 15:21.080]  That tells you all you need to know.
[15:21.080 --> 15:27.080]  Now, Joe Scalzen is a really good geopolitical analyst, and he has his own views of Russia.
[15:27.080 --> 15:35.080]  A lot of what he has said has turned out to be true. Remember when on my show, 20 years ago, predicting that by around this time,
[15:35.080 --> 15:42.080]  in the early 2020s and the mid-2020s, we would see the West pushing China and Russia into war, and now you see that happening.
[15:42.080 --> 15:45.080]  You see Xi Jinping and Putin being brought together.
[15:45.080 --> 15:50.080]  This isn't about whose side you're on, folks. It's about not wanting to have a nuclear war.
[15:50.080 --> 15:56.080]  You just saw the president of the second largest nuclear power in the world threaten nuclear war.
[15:56.080 --> 16:00.080]  The World's Greatest Nuclear Power
[16:00.080 --> 16:05.080]  Sold out for months. X3 is now back in stock.
[16:05.080 --> 16:12.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing, and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[16:12.080 --> 16:19.080]  It's not the soil anymore. Most of the ocean is contaminated, but when you get high quality tri-iodine,
[16:19.080 --> 16:25.080]  all three of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido,
[16:25.080 --> 16:32.080]  and most importantly, your immune system. So, X3, the only tri-iodine on the market, highest grade,
[16:32.080 --> 16:37.080]  is now exclusively available again at 50% off at mfoldwarestore.com.
[16:37.080 --> 16:42.080]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body takes about two weeks to get on average,
[16:42.080 --> 16:48.080]  you really need to experience X3. Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[16:48.080 --> 16:53.080]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body.
[16:53.080 --> 16:57.080]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the M4 war, a true 360 win.
[16:57.080 --> 17:01.080]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off at limited time.
[17:01.080 --> 17:07.080]  With all the craziness going on in the world, with the globalists plotting their next big lockdown,
[17:07.080 --> 17:14.080]  with the next phase of the Great Reset being a stage-cyber attack, with the deep state pushing a civil war,
[17:14.080 --> 17:21.080]  not just here, but in Europe and war with Russia, with the massive inflation and all the other garbage
[17:21.080 --> 17:27.080]  that's taking place like supply chain right now, you need to get prepared now with high-quality, storable food
[17:27.080 --> 17:34.080]  that is ready to ship. And it's been four years since my Patriot supply at preparewithalix.com
[17:34.080 --> 17:40.080]  has offered their storable food at 25% off, four years.
[17:40.080 --> 17:47.080]  But right now, it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022, a little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this
[17:47.080 --> 17:54.080]  to get 25% off at preparewithalix.com on the entire catalog of my Patriot supply.
[17:54.080 --> 18:21.080]  Act now, get prepared now. This is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[18:21.080 --> 18:26.080]  Superbill volatility really, really works. It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds
[18:26.080 --> 18:32.080]  that have never been heated up, and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[18:32.080 --> 18:36.080]  They also work quite well, but just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine wine.
[18:36.080 --> 18:41.080]  In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[18:41.080 --> 18:44.080]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[18:44.080 --> 18:50.080]  That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[18:50.080 --> 19:01.080]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[19:01.080 --> 19:06.080]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the Globalist.
[19:06.080 --> 19:13.080]  I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[19:13.080 --> 19:16.080]  But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[19:16.080 --> 19:24.080]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[19:24.080 --> 19:30.080]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show
[19:30.080 --> 19:33.080]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[19:33.080 --> 19:36.080]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda,
[19:36.080 --> 19:38.080]  but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[19:38.080 --> 19:41.080]  And one of the number one things to do is high-quality, storeable food.
[19:41.080 --> 19:45.080]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[19:45.080 --> 19:51.080]  So whether it's a month or a six-month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[19:51.080 --> 19:56.080]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[19:56.080 --> 20:25.080]  Because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[20:25.080 --> 20:28.080]  End of the world, alert.
[20:28.080 --> 20:34.080]  End of civilization as we know it, alert.
[20:34.080 --> 20:41.080]  Vladimir Putin officially threatens to use nuclear weapons against Europe if NATO continues takeover of Ukraine.
[20:41.080 --> 20:44.080]  An official press conference, Putin threw down the gauntlet,
[20:44.080 --> 20:49.080]  warning the West if NATO invokes Article 5 and absorbs Ukraine to NATO.
[20:49.080 --> 20:54.080]  Within a blink of an eye, he said the West will see a massive military response.
[20:54.080 --> 20:59.080]  And then he says NATO has the force to crush Russia with conventional weapons,
[20:59.080 --> 21:04.080]  and he will use nuclear weapons and that he will strike Western Europe.
[21:04.080 --> 21:09.080]  Now let me break down the timetable on this if this starts.
[21:09.080 --> 21:19.080]  When the Russians get overwhelmed by the NATO forces arrayed against them and all that heavy weapons and high-tech weapons,
[21:19.080 --> 21:26.080]  Putin is saying that they're going to use tactical nuclear weapons in theater against those forces.
[21:26.080 --> 21:31.080]  That will happen within about 10 minutes.
[21:31.080 --> 21:41.080]  At that point, the orders will go out and cruise missiles all over Europe, hypersonic, will be fired at Russian military bases.
[21:41.080 --> 21:46.080]  Once the Russians make the decision to use tacticals, they'll have all their submarines surfacing,
[21:46.080 --> 21:52.080]  their cruise missiles ready, their ICBMs ready, and the minute they detect with their radar and satellites,
[21:52.080 --> 21:58.080]  Western missile launches, they will have a total commitment release of their weapons.
[21:58.080 --> 22:02.080]  Their submarines will come up off our coast, they will vaporize Manhattan, Los Angeles,
[22:02.080 --> 22:06.080]  all of the Russian cities will be vaporized as well.
[22:06.080 --> 22:10.080]  Western Europe will be vaporized.
[22:10.080 --> 22:17.080]  Where I live in Austin, Texas, we'll have MIRV-tipped missiles open coming back into the atmosphere,
[22:17.080 --> 22:23.080]  launching dozens of warheads at military targets all over central Texas.
[22:23.080 --> 22:29.080]  Most of us will just get knocked down and maybe the roof cave in on you,
[22:29.080 --> 22:33.080]  but when you come outside, you'll be breathing all that delicious radiation,
[22:33.080 --> 22:37.080]  and of course the power won't be coming back on for years if you're lucky.
[22:37.080 --> 22:44.080]  So that's where we are, and we're an evil, decadent, satanic society, and I guess it's time to die.
[22:44.080 --> 22:47.080]  I mean, really.
[22:47.080 --> 22:52.080]  And that's the level of brinksmanship that's going on right now.
[22:52.080 --> 22:59.080]  So when the time it takes you to load your children in the car and drive to the school five miles away,
[22:59.080 --> 23:03.080]  and then drive to your work 15 minutes away,
[23:03.080 --> 23:08.080]  and then go walk into your office and sit down at your computer, in 25 minutes,
[23:08.080 --> 23:14.080]  the world as we know it will be over once this starts.
[23:14.080 --> 23:18.080]  We won't hear about it for five, ten minutes if I was live on air when it went down.
[23:18.080 --> 23:22.080]  I would not have time to get in my car and go get my four-year-old daughter
[23:22.080 --> 23:27.080]  before the mushroom clouds start, before the shock waves hit,
[23:27.080 --> 23:36.080]  before the airburst hydrogen bombs detonated 2,000 feet in the air.
[23:36.080 --> 23:42.080]  And there goes your Netflix, and you ask, why does this happen?
[23:42.080 --> 23:48.080]  Because the type of psychotics that get in control over history
[23:48.080 --> 23:51.080]  want global domination, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:51.080 --> 23:57.080]  Yeah, what do you think all those destroyers and missile cruisers are doing driving around in the Atlantic Ocean
[23:57.080 --> 24:04.080]  and the Mediterranean and then North Sea and all the rest of it?
[24:04.080 --> 24:08.080]  They're all carrying nuclear weapons. They're all carrying cruise missiles
[24:08.080 --> 24:17.080]  that fly along at 50 feet above the waterline and then detonate above their targets.
[24:17.080 --> 24:20.080]  And that's where we are.
[24:20.080 --> 24:27.080]  We're on Russia's doorstep. The West started the proxy war there.
[24:27.080 --> 24:32.080]  And if the Russians were pure communists and Satanists like Hollywood was, again,
[24:32.080 --> 24:37.080]  back when the Hollywood-type crowd ran in Russia, then I would be saying,
[24:37.080 --> 24:43.080]  oh, well, nuclear war is something I don't want to have, but the Russians are a threat.
[24:43.080 --> 24:50.080]  But we're in a greater threat of war with Russia today because it's more of a Christian nation
[24:50.080 --> 24:53.080]  and breaking with the globalist power structure.
[24:53.080 --> 24:57.080]  And so that's why Hollywood and the Left hate Russia so much,
[24:57.080 --> 25:01.080]  because for 80-plus years they could do whatever they wanted to Russia.
[25:01.080 --> 25:03.080]  It was their little playground.
[25:03.080 --> 25:06.080]  And the Left, all the wealthy leftists from the Clintons to Bernie Sanders,
[25:06.080 --> 25:13.080]  they all went to Russia for their honeymoons and visits where they could go see a land where atheism
[25:13.080 --> 25:18.080]  and Satanism reigned and where the people could be dominated by a horrible, evil mega-state.
[25:18.080 --> 25:24.080]  But now, because Putin doesn't follow their orders,
[25:24.080 --> 25:27.080]  they are so upset because he stands in the way of their New World Order.
[25:27.080 --> 25:30.080]  And just as Joe Scowls had said on my show 20 years ago,
[25:30.080 --> 25:37.080]  that the West would provoke and start fights with China and Russia in the future
[25:37.080 --> 25:43.080]  and with faint weakness here to trick China and Russia into a joint nuclear strike on the West,
[25:43.080 --> 25:46.080]  which is meant to knock out the original political system,
[25:46.080 --> 25:49.080]  and out of that comes a fascist system in the West,
[25:49.080 --> 25:52.080]  which will then have a war with Russia and China, which will be won,
[25:52.080 --> 25:59.080]  and then you'll have your worldwide New World Order system in place via that conflict.
[25:59.080 --> 26:03.080]  And I'm telling Scowls, well, the Chinese are on the globalist payroll.
[26:03.080 --> 26:04.080]  I mean, they're being built up.
[26:04.080 --> 26:09.080]  He's like, well, they're going to double-cross them sometime by 2023, 2024, 2025,
[26:09.080 --> 26:11.080]  is when I project this will happen.
[26:11.080 --> 26:14.080]  And he is a real researcher and a real historian,
[26:14.080 --> 26:21.080]  of course, a Marine Corps officer and naval aviator, smart guy.
[26:21.080 --> 26:24.080]  And I said, man, we got to get him on today.
[26:24.080 --> 26:26.080]  And he's not a Russophile. He doesn't like Putin.
[26:26.080 --> 26:28.080]  He calls it a predator state.
[26:28.080 --> 26:30.080]  He doesn't like Xi Jinping, neither do I.
[26:30.080 --> 26:34.080]  But Xi Jinping is saying we're not going to cut our son's penises off,
[26:34.080 --> 26:36.080]  like the kids are taught in school here.
[26:36.080 --> 26:38.080]  He says we're not going to have sissy men on TV.
[26:38.080 --> 26:42.080]  We're not going to have abortions anymore.
[26:42.080 --> 26:44.080]  We're going to pay people to have kids.
[26:44.080 --> 26:45.080]  Same thing Putin's doing.
[26:45.080 --> 26:47.080]  So I judge a tree by its fruits.
[26:47.080 --> 26:51.080]  They understand that they want to have big, powerful systems that are dominant,
[26:51.080 --> 26:54.080]  and you don't do that with what America's doing.
[26:54.080 --> 26:56.080]  So the globalists are attacking us.
[26:56.080 --> 26:57.080]  They're attacking the Russians.
[26:57.080 --> 26:58.080]  They're attacking the Chinese.
[26:58.080 --> 27:02.080]  They're attacking everybody.
[27:02.080 --> 27:06.080]  So we're going to come back, and I'm going to shift gears into all of the other huge news,
[27:06.080 --> 27:11.080]  but this is a big, big, big deal.
[27:11.080 --> 27:20.080]  Separately, I went to the grocery store yesterday,
[27:20.080 --> 27:29.080]  and it was almost empty of orange juice, and of milk, and of butter, and of lettuce,
[27:29.080 --> 27:30.080]  and of just everything.
[27:30.080 --> 27:33.080]  And Texas is a bread master compared to other parts of the country.
[27:33.080 --> 27:34.080]  Texas is like California.
[27:34.080 --> 27:37.080]  We have massive systems.
[27:37.080 --> 27:39.080]  We have tropical areas down on the border.
[27:39.080 --> 27:40.080]  I mean, we have it all.
[27:40.080 --> 27:46.080]  Third largest producer in the U.S. of citrus is the South Texas.
[27:46.080 --> 27:51.080]  And the fact that the store shelves look like a hurricane is about to hit,
[27:51.080 --> 27:53.080]  and people clean them off, tells you something.
[27:53.080 --> 27:55.080]  In the Northeast, it's on the local news.
[27:55.080 --> 27:58.080]  They've been basically bare for months and months,
[27:58.080 --> 28:03.080]  and it's because farmers and people can't produce with the COVID shutdowns and lockdowns,
[28:03.080 --> 28:07.080]  and the supply chains have broken down.
[28:07.080 --> 28:10.080]  And so everybody thinks it's fun to slack and fun to not go to work,
[28:10.080 --> 28:15.080]  and fun to just kind of stand around all day and talk, even if you do go to work.
[28:15.080 --> 28:18.080]  That's how civilization collapses.
[28:18.080 --> 28:21.080]  That's what happened in Venezuela and Cuba.
[28:21.080 --> 28:24.080]  Because the communists take everything you produce, so why should you produce?
[28:24.080 --> 28:25.080]  So people stop producing.
[28:25.080 --> 28:27.080]  Well, with the globalists, they just don't let you produce,
[28:27.080 --> 28:34.080]  and they also devalue your currency so that people that run businesses that supply the supply chain,
[28:34.080 --> 28:37.080]  they can't make ends meet anymore.
[28:37.080 --> 28:39.080]  Because if you raise the prices, people can't pay for it,
[28:39.080 --> 28:42.080]  but then you can't get the money to run your operation.
[28:42.080 --> 28:44.080]  So we're going into a depression.
[28:44.080 --> 28:46.080]  We're going into an economic collapse.
[28:46.080 --> 28:47.080]  We're going into hyperinflation.
[28:47.080 --> 28:48.080]  We're going into war.
[28:48.080 --> 28:50.080]  We're going into cyber attacks.
[28:50.080 --> 28:51.080]  We're going into stage terror attacks.
[28:51.080 --> 28:53.080]  We're going into hell.
[28:53.080 --> 28:55.080]  So just get ready and get right with Jesus.
[28:55.080 --> 29:24.080]  All right, we'll be right back. Stay with us.
[29:25.080 --> 29:26.080]  We'll be right back.
[29:55.080 --> 30:08.080]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[30:08.080 --> 30:14.080]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[30:14.080 --> 30:21.080]  This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[30:21.080 --> 30:28.080]  The hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[30:28.080 --> 30:33.080]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[30:33.080 --> 30:39.080]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[30:39.080 --> 30:44.080]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition,
[30:44.080 --> 30:47.080]  immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[30:47.080 --> 30:54.080]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[30:54.080 --> 31:01.080]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[31:01.080 --> 31:09.080]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[31:09.080 --> 31:13.080]  If you are having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of,
[31:13.080 --> 31:17.080]  our new sleep support formula down and out is just the thing.
[31:17.080 --> 31:24.080]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut eye you deserve.
[31:24.080 --> 31:29.080]  Formulated to improve upon our best selling product knockout with down and out,
[31:29.080 --> 31:35.080]  now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[31:35.080 --> 31:40.080]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[31:40.080 --> 31:44.080]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower,
[31:44.080 --> 31:50.080]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[31:50.080 --> 31:56.080]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.

[32:27.080 --> 32:32.080]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps,
[32:32.080 --> 32:35.080]  the traders know they can shut us down by force.
[32:35.080 --> 32:38.080]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[32:38.080 --> 32:40.080]  So be it.
[32:40.080 --> 32:42.080]  Make them silence us by force.
[32:42.080 --> 32:45.080]  This is the final battle of the information war.

[33:01.080 --> 33:11.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:11.080 --> 33:25.080]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:25.080 --> 33:30.080]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:30.080 --> 33:33.080]  So it's really hard for me to cover any other news than this,
[33:33.080 --> 33:38.080]  but I'm going to be going into it in great detail in the third hour of the Alex Jones show today
[33:38.080 --> 33:43.080]  with Joe Scalzen, but Vladimir Putin did say that if NATO continues their takeover of Ukraine,
[33:43.080 --> 33:48.080]  which is going on, that they're going to militarily move against it
[33:48.080 --> 33:52.080]  and that they expect that when NATO forces attack Russian forces,
[33:52.080 --> 33:55.080]  they're going to use nuclear weapons on them.
[33:55.080 --> 33:58.080]  And he said we're going to bring Europe into it.
[33:58.080 --> 34:00.080]  And it's just unbelievable.
[34:00.080 --> 34:05.080]  I'll be recapping some of that next hour and then going into it in depth in the third hour today,
[34:05.080 --> 34:10.080]  ahead of Wayne Allen Root in the fourth hour.
[34:10.080 --> 34:14.080]  And then I've got a really big announcement to make.
[34:14.080 --> 34:19.080]  It's some really important information that I'm going to get to at the bottom of the next hour.
[34:19.080 --> 34:24.080]  And it's so surreal to tell people this stuff,
[34:24.080 --> 34:29.080]  but I need listeners to know the inside stuff going on so that when you hear me say,
[34:29.080 --> 34:34.080]  hey, we're fighting to stay on air, you realize that's not a bluff.
[34:34.080 --> 34:38.080]  That's not something we're just saying.
[34:38.080 --> 34:47.080]  We've had the establishment literally say we want unconditional surrender of you
[34:47.080 --> 34:53.080]  and we want you to basically turn against everything you stand for and everything you've done,
[34:53.080 --> 34:56.080]  or we're not going to stop and we're going to shut you down.
[34:56.080 --> 35:01.080]  Because the goal of all these fraudulent lawsuits and these red courts, they are totally regged.
[35:01.080 --> 35:04.080]  I mean, it's like living in Nazi Germany. I mean, look around all the stuff we see here.
[35:04.080 --> 35:08.080]  Our old Soviet Russia is just completely red.
[35:08.080 --> 35:13.080]  And the whole exercise of this has not been about getting money from us.
[35:13.080 --> 35:17.080]  It's been about finding out how we operate and how we run and shutting us down.
[35:17.080 --> 35:20.080]  And that's now completely out in the open.
[35:20.080 --> 35:24.080]  And so Ted Anderson is going to be joining us, the owner of the GCN radio network,
[35:24.080 --> 35:29.080]  that is one of the providers that puts us out on satellite to tell you some of the stuff that's been going on.
[35:29.080 --> 35:33.080]  The last few years behind the scenes you didn't know about.
[35:33.080 --> 35:36.080]  And this is the tip of the iceberg, folks. This is a war.
[35:36.080 --> 35:43.080]  Now, I want to hit some news right now that dovetails with what's happening behind the scenes to us.
[35:43.080 --> 35:45.080]  And I want you to understand what's happened.
[35:45.080 --> 35:52.080]  They've weaponized the courts. They've weaponized all the different government bureaucracies and agencies.
[35:52.080 --> 35:57.080]  And they've weaponized the university students and now even some high school students
[35:57.080 --> 36:02.080]  into what you'd call a Soviet-style or Maoist-style spy grid
[36:02.080 --> 36:06.080]  with fake companies and infiltrators and everything.
[36:06.080 --> 36:11.080]  And I've been up here trying to explain to you, this is a total war, what just broke in Politico.
[36:11.080 --> 36:13.080]  And they're very proud of it. Like, it's a good thing.
[36:13.080 --> 36:17.080]  You've heard how they're setting up Capitol Police units all over the country
[36:17.080 --> 36:19.080]  with billions, two million dollars in funding.
[36:19.080 --> 36:21.080]  And you ask, how do they do that? It's not constitutional.
[36:21.080 --> 36:27.080]  Congress now creates its own executive agency separate from the executive power of the presidency
[36:27.080 --> 36:30.080]  that is operating now in all 50 states with two million dollars
[36:30.080 --> 36:36.080]  and sets up fake construction companies and home repair companies.
[36:36.080 --> 36:42.080]  That's what spies do to get in your houses.
[36:42.080 --> 36:44.080]  Of course.
[36:44.080 --> 36:51.080]  And this is what I've had to enjoy because it's not the Capitol Police. I haven't had any issues with them yet.
[36:51.080 --> 36:58.080]  It's the other weaponized universities, the CIA, through Georgetown University.
[36:58.080 --> 37:05.080]  Literally has sicked an army of over 10,000 Muslims that they brought in over the last few decades,
[37:05.080 --> 37:11.080]  run through the school and given degrees, and had intelligence badges enter after us.
[37:11.080 --> 37:15.080]  They've got gags of Muslims.
[37:15.080 --> 37:19.080]  I mean, they've got their secret armies, they're ready.
[37:19.080 --> 37:23.080]  And they are targeting and preparing.
[37:23.080 --> 37:27.080]  They've got a list of judges. They've got a list of good police captains.
[37:27.080 --> 37:29.080]  They've got all our numbers, folks.
[37:29.080 --> 37:31.080]  We're in a lot more trouble than you know.
[37:31.080 --> 37:35.080]  A lot more trouble than you know.
[37:35.080 --> 37:40.080]  And they, like a military, have said surrender and set things supposedly off the record
[37:40.080 --> 37:45.080]  that I don't think it's protected because I believe it's criminal.
[37:45.080 --> 37:47.080]  But we'll see.
[37:47.080 --> 37:51.080]  But they've certainly been off a lot more than they can shoot.
[37:51.080 --> 37:56.080]  But this is a real takeover. This country has bad cancer.
[37:56.080 --> 37:59.080]  This country has criminal authoritarianism.
[37:59.080 --> 38:02.080]  And the FBI is not going to do a damn thing about it.
[38:02.080 --> 38:04.080]  In fact, it's heavily involved in it.
[38:04.080 --> 38:08.080]  So this is just a criminal group working with multinational corporations
[38:08.080 --> 38:13.080]  hustling in using classic intelligence agency infiltration,
[38:13.080 --> 38:17.080]  disruption, espionage tactics against America.
[38:17.080 --> 38:19.080]  That's what cutting off the pipelines are.
[38:19.080 --> 38:20.080]  That's what imploding the borders are.
[38:20.080 --> 38:22.080]  That's what's demoralizing the children are.
[38:22.080 --> 38:24.080]  That's what defunding the police is.
[38:24.080 --> 38:29.080]  This is what you do when you're taken a country down.
[38:29.080 --> 38:33.080]  And they want their people in before the big cyber detector going to launch.
[38:33.080 --> 38:35.080]  They want their people in before they launch big wars.
[38:35.080 --> 38:40.080]  All of this is so they can emerge after the big war in control.
[38:40.080 --> 38:42.080]  We're a cursed nation now.
[38:42.080 --> 38:44.080]  We've lost the blessing of God.
[38:44.080 --> 38:46.080]  Let's just be honest about it.
[38:46.080 --> 38:53.080]  And the vast majority of people serving this system believe they're about to get this wonderful paycheck
[38:53.080 --> 38:58.080]  and positions of power in this new North America, Venezuela style system.
[38:58.080 --> 39:00.080]  And of course, that's not what they're going to get.
[39:00.080 --> 39:10.080]  The group that always brings this thing to power is then the group that's actually put in prison or killed.
[39:10.080 --> 39:12.080]  Very, very sad, ladies and gentlemen.
[39:12.080 --> 39:14.080]  So I'll cover this next segment.
[39:14.080 --> 39:22.080]  But oh, the inspector general opens an investigation into spying allegations against capital police,
[39:22.080 --> 39:35.080]  running around, setting up fake companies around the country, and infiltrating and spying on members of Congress.
[39:35.080 --> 39:38.080]  So we're going to come back and cover all of that in the next segment.
[39:38.080 --> 39:42.080]  But that's how this works, ladies and gentlemen, and that's where we are.
[39:42.080 --> 39:44.080]  We're going to go to break and come back with all of that.
[39:44.080 --> 39:48.080]  And we're going to have the latest with a special guest who's there with a convoy at Truckers,
[39:48.080 --> 39:55.080]  who's a reporter and a former special forces officer who has sources inside the military and police.
[39:55.080 --> 39:59.080]  And he said this weeks ago, and now it's confirmed that they're planning to use the military Tiananmen's
[39:59.080 --> 40:06.080]  square style with riot police coming up in the next 48 hours against the peaceful convoy there
[40:06.080 --> 40:09.080]  that's trying to end the blockade of the COVID lockdowns.
[40:09.080 --> 40:11.080]  So they're blockade busters.
[40:11.080 --> 40:13.080]  They're not a blockade as Trudeau is saying.
[40:13.080 --> 40:16.080]  Everything Trudeau says is they're cutting off our medicine and our food.
[40:16.080 --> 40:17.080]  They're destroying our economy.
[40:17.080 --> 40:19.080]  That's what they've done for two years.
[40:19.080 --> 40:21.080]  And now they don't like honking.
[40:21.080 --> 40:22.080]  That's coming up.
[40:22.080 --> 40:26.080]  But separately, here's a report out of the U.K. where it's even worse than it is here,
[40:26.080 --> 40:28.080]  but it's now starting here.
[40:28.080 --> 40:31.080]  Not just inflation, but the scarcity that comes with it.
[40:31.080 --> 40:35.080]  People who go and shop at that Tesco, they rely on their petrol.
[40:35.080 --> 40:36.080]  They rely on their food.
[40:36.080 --> 40:41.080]  They rely on a lot of hardware goods for around the house and things as well.
[40:41.080 --> 40:48.080]  And these rises we're talking about right across the board.
[40:48.080 --> 40:49.080]  Yeah, absolutely.
[40:49.080 --> 40:52.080]  I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news on a Monday morning,
[40:52.080 --> 40:56.080]  but when the chairman of Tesco says something, it really matters
[40:56.080 --> 41:00.080]  because it's Britain's biggest supermarket and it employs around 300,000 people,
[41:00.080 --> 41:04.080]  making it Britain's biggest private sector employer.
[41:04.080 --> 41:11.080]  Now, John Allen has said the worst is yet to come in an interview yesterday with the BBC.
[41:11.080 --> 41:14.080]  He said that heating or eating troubles them.
[41:14.080 --> 41:23.080]  He also pushed back at Jack Monroe, the food poverty campaigners claim that the basic goods in supermarkets,
[41:23.080 --> 41:27.080]  the basic staples like rice and pasta, are rising faster than inflation.
[41:27.080 --> 41:29.080]  He says that he can't speak for other supermarkets,
[41:29.080 --> 41:34.080]  but at Tesco, food inflation has remained at around 1% for the past three months.
[41:34.080 --> 41:38.080]  Food inflation according to the British Retail Consortium for all supermarkets,
[41:38.080 --> 41:41.080]  currently running at around about 2.7%.
[41:41.080 --> 41:42.080]  That's up 0.3%.
[41:42.080 --> 41:43.080]  That's enough.
[41:43.080 --> 41:45.080]  Total BS.
[41:45.080 --> 41:50.080]  So the stores are empty, the prices are going up, but there's no inflation.
[41:50.080 --> 41:52.080]  But the worst is yet to come and everything's okay.
[41:52.080 --> 41:55.080]  That's called double think, that's called mind control.
[41:55.080 --> 41:59.080]  And it's happening all over the world right now in the third world, starving to death,
[41:59.080 --> 42:03.080]  then being organized by the UN to flood the United States.
[42:03.080 --> 42:09.080]  Well, we've got high quality, storeable food ready to ship to you right now at the lowest price
[42:09.080 --> 42:11.080]  you're going to find anywhere for quality food.
[42:11.080 --> 42:14.080]  Even the cheap crappy stuff isn't this inexpensive.
[42:14.080 --> 42:16.080]  People are greedy and put huge markups on it.
[42:16.080 --> 42:18.080]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[42:18.080 --> 42:21.080]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[42:21.080 --> 42:26.080]  Or you can simply call toll three, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[42:26.080 --> 42:29.080]  That's triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[42:29.080 --> 42:33.080]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[42:33.080 --> 42:37.080]  And when you go to preparewithAlex.com, you can also find everything else.
[42:37.080 --> 42:42.080]  That's just a sublink to our main shopping cart info or store.com.
[42:42.080 --> 42:45.080]  So find it all at infoorstore.com, preparewithAlex.com.
[42:45.080 --> 42:47.080]  The 25% off deal is unprecedented.
[42:47.080 --> 42:50.080]  I haven't done it in four years and it ends on February 13th.
[42:50.080 --> 42:53.080]  And unlike other big food sellers that make you wait weeks or months,
[42:53.080 --> 42:55.080]  now these folks ship right out to you.
[42:55.080 --> 42:56.080]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[42:56.080 --> 42:59.080]  Get ready while you still can.
[42:59.080 --> 43:04.080]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock.
[43:04.080 --> 43:08.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing.
[43:08.080 --> 43:11.080]  And so many people are deficient in iodine.
[43:11.080 --> 43:13.080]  It's not the soil anymore.
[43:13.080 --> 43:15.080]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[43:15.080 --> 43:20.080]  But when you get high quality tri iodine, all three of the healthy types together,
[43:20.080 --> 43:26.080]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly, your immune system.
[43:26.080 --> 43:33.080]  So X3, the only tri iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again.
[43:33.080 --> 43:36.080]  Get 50% off at infoorstore.com.
[43:36.080 --> 43:40.080]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body,
[43:40.080 --> 43:44.080]  it takes about two weeks to get it on average, you really need to experience X3.
[43:44.080 --> 43:47.080]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[43:47.080 --> 43:52.080]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what does for your body.
[43:52.080 --> 43:57.080]  It's the good halogen, the bad halogen, and it funds the info or a true 360 win.
[43:57.080 --> 44:22.080]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off at limited time.
[44:27.080 --> 44:35.080]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[44:35.080 --> 44:41.080]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy.
[44:41.080 --> 44:46.080]  Leaving companies that only I own, profitable.
[44:46.080 --> 44:48.080]  You will then be my slaves.
[44:48.080 --> 44:56.080]  Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of freedom from Cobra, who will remove your immune system,
[44:56.080 --> 45:00.080]  so you'll be depended on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[45:00.080 --> 45:06.080]  I want to explain something that is absolutely feed understanding our world.
[45:06.080 --> 45:09.080]  It's very, very simple, but the multiple don't know.
[45:09.080 --> 45:16.080]  The privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars
[45:16.080 --> 45:25.080]  and other major currencies, and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual property, energy.
[45:25.080 --> 45:31.080]  They're using it to buy people, to buy influence, and in the past they created thousands of trillions
[45:31.080 --> 45:35.080]  so that they could leverage that manipulated market so they never allowed that money
[45:35.080 --> 45:39.080]  to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[45:39.080 --> 45:44.080]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy,
[45:44.080 --> 45:49.080]  buying up everything, not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down
[45:49.080 --> 45:55.080]  and force a collapse of civilization, making the companies they do fund the only things left handed.
[45:55.080 --> 45:58.080]  This is the great reset. This is what's happening now.
[45:58.080 --> 46:01.080]  We warn everyone. It's the only way to stop it.
[46:01.080 --> 46:06.080]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on
[46:06.080 --> 46:09.080]  both at home and the world at large.
[46:09.080 --> 46:14.080]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of,
[46:14.080 --> 46:18.080]  our new sleep support formula, Down and Out, is just the thing.
[46:18.080 --> 46:25.080]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[46:25.080 --> 46:30.080]  Formulated to improve upon our best selling product, Knockout, with Down and Out,
[46:30.080 --> 46:35.080]  now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[46:35.080 --> 46:40.080]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[46:40.080 --> 46:44.080]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the Passion Flower,
[46:44.080 --> 46:48.080]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees,
[46:48.080 --> 46:51.080]  who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[46:51.080 --> 46:54.080]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep,
[46:54.080 --> 46:57.080]  because you will be Down and Out.
[46:57.080 --> 47:01.080]  Selling out now at infowarstore.com.
[47:01.080 --> 47:08.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:20.080 --> 47:23.080]  Again, you remember two years ago, I started telling you over and over again
[47:23.080 --> 47:26.080]  you need to get storable food because of inflation.
[47:26.080 --> 47:30.080]  That's one way to beat inflation is to get high quality, storable food that last decades,
[47:30.080 --> 47:37.080]  but is really delicious and healthy, so that you could beat inflation.
[47:37.080 --> 47:41.080]  That's one of the best ways to do it, is storable food if you know you're going into an inflationary period.
[47:41.080 --> 47:45.080]  Plus, you've got the food lines, you've got the breakdowns of the supply chain
[47:45.080 --> 47:47.080]  that are only getting worse around the world.
[47:47.080 --> 47:50.080]  It is a no-brainer to do that at preparathalix.com.
[47:50.080 --> 47:53.080]  But I'm just thinking back to how dead on we've been about all this,
[47:53.080 --> 47:55.080]  and how I wish this wasn't the case.
[47:55.080 --> 47:59.080]  Now, here's a great example of how the media dials things back.
[47:59.080 --> 48:04.080]  When it's having to report on something, the establishment has done.
[48:04.080 --> 48:09.080]  Look at this Daily Mail headline, and almost no one else picked this up.
[48:09.080 --> 48:18.080]  Russia makes a fool of Macron by denying that Putin agreed on Ukraine deal despite claims.
[48:18.080 --> 48:21.080]  But that's not the article.
[48:21.080 --> 48:28.080]  You read deeper, he threatens nuclear war in a blink of an eye if NATO continues its invasion.
[48:28.080 --> 48:30.080]  And I played the video earlier.
[48:30.080 --> 48:38.080]  The video is posted on infowars.com in the live show Feed, right underneath my feed.
[48:38.080 --> 48:43.080]  Now imagine, that's how they do this, is it should be Putin threatens nuclear war in the blink of an eye
[48:43.080 --> 48:48.080]  if NATO continues the invasion of Ukraine.
[48:48.080 --> 48:50.080]  That's what he said.
[48:50.080 --> 48:52.080]  I played it twice earlier.
[48:52.080 --> 48:54.080]  He just tuned in.
[48:54.080 --> 48:58.080]  But it said, oh, he made a fool of Macron.
[48:58.080 --> 49:00.080]  When he did say, I give you a deal.
[49:00.080 --> 49:05.080]  Stop invading, stop sitting in heavy arms, and we will back down as well.
[49:05.080 --> 49:08.080]  But you are escalating on our border.
[49:08.080 --> 49:11.080]  Now, there it is, cut and dry.
[49:11.080 --> 49:15.080]  The average America doesn't even know what Putin wants, because this is not on the news.
[49:15.080 --> 49:20.080]  I searched it before the show and during a break a few minutes ago.
[49:20.080 --> 49:25.080]  It's nowhere except buried in a daily mail article and all over the Russian news.
[49:25.080 --> 49:30.080]  And he told the press conference with hundreds of news agencies, please get this out everywhere.
[49:30.080 --> 49:31.080]  I keep warning you.
[49:31.080 --> 49:33.080]  I keep telling you, but you won't report it.
[49:33.080 --> 49:42.080]  We're going to use nuclear weapons if you overwhelm our forces, which is standard military procedure.
[49:42.080 --> 49:47.080]  And we've got U.S. senators bipartisan threatening nuclear sneak attacks on Russia.
[49:47.080 --> 49:53.080]  So that's why Putin's now saying, OK.
[49:53.080 --> 49:58.080]  We don't want this fight, he says, but you're asking for it.
[49:58.080 --> 50:01.080]  And I know you've got more weapons than we do, but we can't be pushed around.
[50:01.080 --> 50:10.080]  And it's not on our news because we have controlled news in this country.
[50:10.080 --> 50:15.080]  And you know, Joe Rogan comes out.
[50:15.080 --> 50:20.080]  In a couple of days, if I send this to him or if he finds out about it and tells tens of millions of people,
[50:20.080 --> 50:25.080]  they'll call him a Russian agent just because he doesn't want to die or start a war.
[50:25.080 --> 50:28.080]  And you'll be called a Russian agent or I'll be called a Russian agent.
[50:28.080 --> 50:29.080]  It's ridiculous.
[50:29.080 --> 50:34.080]  How about an agent of sanity?
[50:34.080 --> 50:36.080]  Now, here's the perfect example of that.
[50:36.080 --> 50:42.080]  You see how that's a whitewash headline and at least an daily mail reported on it.
[50:42.080 --> 50:44.080]  Look at this Politico article.
[50:44.080 --> 50:50.080]  The Capitol Police examined background social media feeds of some who meet with lawmakers.
[50:50.080 --> 50:54.080]  You read the article, it says, yeah, they also get in plain clothes to spy on people.
[50:54.080 --> 51:01.080]  But now the documents are coming out being released by Congress and the investigation of the inspector general
[51:01.080 --> 51:04.080]  and inspecting themselves of the Capitol Police.
[51:04.080 --> 51:09.080]  And when you read what's in this, it's unbelievable.
[51:09.080 --> 51:17.080]  They went into members of Congress's offices at night like the plumbers, like Nixon did,
[51:17.080 --> 51:25.080]  having G. Gordon Liddy and others break into the psychiatrist of the Democrat candidate
[51:25.080 --> 51:27.080]  to find out about him for dirt.
[51:27.080 --> 51:28.080]  Not right, not good.
[51:28.080 --> 51:30.080]  Nixon had to leave office.
[51:30.080 --> 51:33.080]  This is the Capitol Police breaking in people's offices,
[51:33.080 --> 51:45.080]  posing as Capitol Repair officers or Capitol Repair technicians and photographing and stealing material.
[51:45.080 --> 51:49.080]  And this is what they've gotten the university students to do.
[51:49.080 --> 51:51.080]  I mean, the left is recruited.
[51:51.080 --> 51:53.080]  You think antifa is the only folks out breaking into things.
[51:53.080 --> 51:59.080]  The ADL got caught in the 80s breaking into police departments and stealing their files on people.
[51:59.080 --> 52:02.080]  And now they just run the police.
[52:02.080 --> 52:03.080]  So here we are.
[52:03.080 --> 52:11.080]  Congresswoman Troy Neals says the Capitol Police Intelligence Division investigated my office illegally
[52:11.080 --> 52:14.080]  and one of my staffers caught him in the act.
[52:14.080 --> 52:19.080]  On November 20, 2021, Capitol Police entered my office without my knowledge
[52:19.080 --> 52:24.080]  and photographed confidential legislative products protected by speech and debate clause
[52:24.080 --> 52:28.080]  enshrined in the Constitution Article 1, Section 6.
[52:28.080 --> 52:33.080]  Two days later on Monday, November 22, Thanksgiving week,
[52:33.080 --> 52:38.080]  three intelligence officers attempted to enter my office while the house was in recess.
[52:38.080 --> 52:42.080]  Upon discovering, a member of my staff, a special agent dressed like construction workers,
[52:42.080 --> 52:48.080]  began to question him as to his contents of a photograph taken illegally two days earlier.
[52:48.080 --> 52:53.080]  Yep, secret police, folks, with $2 billion of funding from Pelosi.
[52:53.080 --> 52:57.080]  You think they're going to give up power in 273 days?
[52:57.080 --> 53:00.080]  No, they're not. They're not.
[53:00.080 --> 53:05.080]  And we can't let them trick us into violent confrontations.
[53:05.080 --> 53:08.080]  Everybody hates them. Everybody knows they're evil.
[53:08.080 --> 53:11.080]  Everybody knows the government's run by pedophiles. The Democrats are satanic.
[53:11.080 --> 53:13.080]  Everybody knows it now. Basically everybody.
[53:13.080 --> 53:18.080]  There's a total collapse in confidence in these people.
[53:18.080 --> 53:21.080]  All they can do now is violence and war and depression.
[53:21.080 --> 53:26.080]  And so we just let everybody know they're the ones behind that too.
[53:26.080 --> 53:30.080]  And their own families will then turn against them.
[53:30.080 --> 53:33.080]  Their own society. They want to shun us. We're going to shun them, ladies and gentlemen.
[53:33.080 --> 53:37.080]  We're not going to give them the war they want, though.
[53:37.080 --> 53:41.080]  They know they're a power structure that has maybe 10% support.
[53:41.080 --> 53:46.080]  They know it's over for them. And all they've got left is to overturn it.
[53:46.080 --> 53:50.080]  But it gets better. You heard how they're sitting up offices around the country?
[53:50.080 --> 53:54.080]  In the documents, even political reports on,
[53:54.080 --> 54:04.080]  they set up fake offices, fake construction workers,
[54:04.080 --> 54:10.080]  fake companies.
[54:10.080 --> 54:16.080]  Just days before the USCP officer entered the Congressperson's office
[54:16.080 --> 54:19.080]  and took the picture of the whiteboard,
[54:19.080 --> 54:23.080]  he said his staff used a brainstorming catalog legislative ideas
[54:23.080 --> 54:27.080]  that Washington Post ran a story about a federal government contractor in rural Texas
[54:27.080 --> 54:32.080]  who defrauded the United States by supplying Chinese-made body armor,
[54:32.080 --> 54:35.080]  instead of body armor manufactured in the United States.
[54:35.080 --> 54:37.080]  From his home in rural Texas, a would-be defense contractor
[54:37.080 --> 54:42.080]  spun a web of fake companies and testing reports to pass the Chinese-made body armor
[54:42.080 --> 54:48.080]  onto American equipment that met rigorous standards.
[54:48.080 --> 54:51.080]  Washington Post wrote on November 2001,
[54:51.080 --> 54:55.080]  that Senator Jackson, 32-plus guilty Tuesday in Alexandria federal court
[54:55.080 --> 54:58.080]  to one of the wire fraud felony possible 20 years in prison.
[54:58.080 --> 55:02.080]  According to Nells, who previously served as the sheriff of Fort Bend, Texas,
[55:02.080 --> 55:07.080]  his office whiteboard specifically called out faulty Chinese body armor.
[55:07.080 --> 55:10.080]  In fact, the Washington Post article was a key catalyst
[55:10.080 --> 55:13.080]  spurring Nells to consider drafting legislation
[55:13.080 --> 55:16.080]  ban the procurement of Chinese body armor.
[55:16.080 --> 55:19.080]  But why were the Capitol Police there wanting to know about that?
[55:19.080 --> 55:23.080]  In 2001, they found patterns of the Chinese-run Democrats.
[55:23.080 --> 55:26.080]  I mean, most of the top Democrats are Chinese, double agent spies on record,
[55:26.080 --> 55:30.080]  wanting to try to stop any legislation that exposes the Chinese infiltration.
[55:30.080 --> 55:36.080]  So you see how this just gets worse and worse and worse.
[55:36.080 --> 55:43.080]  It also gets into all the other things that they basically stole and took.
[55:43.080 --> 55:46.080]  And it's just absolutely insane.
[55:46.080 --> 55:49.080]  And there's a lot more of this going on as they set these offices up
[55:49.080 --> 55:52.080]  around the country, not just California, not just Florida.
[55:52.080 --> 55:54.080]  Georgia, Texas, you name it.
[55:54.080 --> 55:59.080]  And we had Marjorie Taylor-Green on last week, and I talked to her a day after.
[55:59.080 --> 56:00.080]  She said this exclusive stuff.
[56:00.080 --> 56:03.080]  She said people break in, they break things, they threaten them,
[56:03.080 --> 56:06.080]  they attack their signage at their office in Georgia,
[56:06.080 --> 56:09.080]  and the Capitol Police are in the building with her now in Georgia,
[56:09.080 --> 56:12.080]  and they know who's doing it and do nothing.
[56:12.080 --> 56:15.080]  Well, of course not. It's mostly peaceful.
[56:15.080 --> 56:18.080]  Hell, if somebody burned down her office,
[56:18.080 --> 56:22.080]  the vice president might bail him out of jail.
[56:22.080 --> 56:25.080]  Because this is a communist takeover, folks.
[56:25.080 --> 56:28.080]  This is a classic Marxist-Leninist communist takeover
[56:28.080 --> 56:32.080]  funded by big banks offshore, the same ones that toppled Russia,
[56:32.080 --> 56:34.080]  the same ones that toppled China,
[56:34.080 --> 56:37.080]  and put their own communist control system into exploit the people
[56:37.080 --> 56:39.080]  is now being set up here.
[56:39.080 --> 56:42.080]  We are just absolutely devastated right now.
[56:42.080 --> 56:45.080]  At least the FBI has come out and said, okay, well, there's a giant Chinese communist threat.
[56:45.080 --> 56:48.080]  They've infiltrated everything, works in U.S. history, red alert, red alert.
[56:48.080 --> 56:50.080]  And maybe that's why the Democrats are panicking.
[56:50.080 --> 56:52.080]  Maybe they think something is going to happen to them.
[56:52.080 --> 56:56.080]  But all I can tell you is this country is totally infiltrated and overrun.
[56:56.080 --> 56:58.080]  What we need is a mass awakening to it,
[56:58.080 --> 57:01.080]  not a conflict where they manipulate us into a fight with each other.
[57:01.080 --> 57:03.080]  That is the last thing we want.
[57:03.080 --> 57:08.080]  We need to expose it with the light of truth and spotlight the cockroaches like Ted Nugent says.
[57:08.080 --> 57:11.080]  I'm going to start the next hour. We've got so much coming up.
[57:11.080 --> 57:14.080]  Please remember that we've got a bunch of sales that end today.
[57:14.080 --> 57:19.080]  I said last week in the multivitamin and the zinc vitamin C deal,
[57:19.080 --> 57:21.080]  because it was about to sell out.
[57:21.080 --> 57:23.080]  I wanted to sell it at full price for a while to bring in money,
[57:23.080 --> 57:25.080]  but they never got rid of the sale. I'm not mad at them.
[57:25.080 --> 57:27.080]  But it is going to end today.
[57:27.080 --> 57:29.080]  It is going to end. That's 40% off on those.
[57:29.080 --> 57:31.080]  The new sale is X3. Try it out.

[57:49.080 --> 57:53.080]  Sold out for months. X3 is now back in stock.
[57:53.080 --> 57:56.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing,
[57:56.080 --> 58:01.080]  our products are game changing and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[58:01.080 --> 58:05.080]  It's not the soil anymore. Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[58:05.080 --> 58:10.080]  But when you get high quality tri iodine, all three of the healthy types together,
[58:10.080 --> 58:13.080]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido,
[58:13.080 --> 58:15.080]  but most importantly, your immune system.

[58:31.080 --> 58:33.080]  you really need to experience X3.

[59:07.080 --> 59:08.080]  that also are on the site.
[59:08.080 --> 59:10.080]  infowarstore.com.
[59:10.080 --> 59:12.080]  That's just a site that takes you to these folks.
[59:12.080 --> 59:14.080]  They supply the board for everybody with their systems as well.

[59:25.080 --> 59:27.080]  These aren't, and the calls are free when folks call you.
[59:27.080 --> 59:32.080]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes.
[59:32.080 --> 59:33.080]  So the calls, they were free.
[59:33.080 --> 59:34.080]  It was like a regular cell phone.
[59:34.080 --> 59:35.080]  You're not being tracked or traced.
[59:35.080 --> 59:37.080]  And I keep one in my car.
[59:37.080 --> 59:39.080]  I've given them to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere
[59:39.080 --> 59:40.080]  where regular phones don't work.
[59:40.080 --> 59:41.080]  They work.
[59:41.080 --> 1:00:00.080]  infowarstore.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[1:00:12.080 --> 1:00:13.080]  All right.
[1:00:13.080 --> 1:00:18.080]  A former Special Forces officer and a great reporter and patriot we've had
[1:00:18.080 --> 1:00:19.080]  on many times over the years.
[1:00:19.080 --> 1:00:22.080]  He's in Ottawa, and he's joining us in this segment.
[1:00:22.080 --> 1:00:26.080]  He's got police and military sources that they are preparing to basically
[1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:30.080]  attack like Tiananmen Square 2.0, the peaceful demonstrators that are simply
[1:00:30.080 --> 1:00:34.080]  wanting their country to get out from under the lock of martial law.
[1:00:34.080 --> 1:00:38.080]  They're getting ready to turn the cell phones off, basically jam the communications,
[1:00:38.080 --> 1:00:42.080]  turn off the cell service to be technical, not physically turn the phones off.
[1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:44.080]  That's coming up next segment.
[1:00:44.080 --> 1:00:48.080]  Then Ted Anderson, the owner of the GCN radio network is going to give you the
[1:00:48.080 --> 1:00:52.080]  big inside scoop on plans to try to completely take us off the ear.
[1:00:52.080 --> 1:00:55.080]  It's time for me to start telling folks what's going on here, because I'm not
[1:00:55.080 --> 1:00:57.080]  crying wolf.
[1:00:57.080 --> 1:01:01.080]  But I wanted to take a few minutes out to talk about something that all of you
[1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:05.080]  can do and I can do to win this fight against the tyrants.
[1:01:05.080 --> 1:01:07.080]  And that's get the word out.
[1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:11.080]  In that saying on the Internet, nobody knows who said it, but if the situation
[1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:15.080]  was hopeless, the propaganda would not be necessary.
[1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:19.080]  They can't get away with the great reset and these wars and the devaluation
[1:01:19.080 --> 1:01:23.080]  of the currencies and the open borders and the sexualization of our children
[1:01:23.080 --> 1:01:28.080]  and the human animal cloning and all of these terrible, horrible things.
[1:01:28.080 --> 1:01:34.080]  They can't get away with that if we have speech and we can show where the majority
[1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:36.080]  and we can point out what they're doing is wrong.
[1:01:36.080 --> 1:01:39.080]  Now, I know that's very elementary.
[1:01:39.080 --> 1:01:41.080]  You're like, yeah, tell us something we don't know.
[1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:46.080]  Well, I see quotes like this on Instagram, on YouTube, on Twitter,
[1:01:46.080 --> 1:01:48.080]  every time I'm on it.
[1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:53.080]  And every day I go out in public, every time in a shopping mall or a store
[1:01:53.080 --> 1:01:56.080]  or anywhere, if you guys have overhead shot, I'll show this,
[1:01:56.080 --> 1:02:01.080]  every time people walk up to me and they say things just like this.
[1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:02.080]  This is on Twitter.
[1:02:02.080 --> 1:02:05.080]  Is he back on YouTube?
[1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:09.080]  What platform is he on?
[1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:13.080]  I took my four-year-old daughter and my 17-year-old daughter
[1:02:13.080 --> 1:02:18.080]  to Kalahari Indoor Water Park this weekend for a day and a half.
[1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:22.080]  And I probably had no exaggeration.
[1:02:22.080 --> 1:02:25.080]  200 people come up to me and say they were listeners
[1:02:25.080 --> 1:02:28.080]  in the video game arcade in the bowling alley in the water park.
[1:02:28.080 --> 1:02:32.080]  And about half of them said, man, I used to be a huge fan.
[1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:35.080]  Where do I find you?
[1:02:35.080 --> 1:02:38.080]  Are you back on the air?
[1:02:38.080 --> 1:02:41.080]  And I look at them, and I don't want to be mean to them,
[1:02:41.080 --> 1:02:43.080]  because they're not stupid, they're just not thinking,
[1:02:43.080 --> 1:02:46.080]  because they're so trained to YouTube and Instagram and Facebook
[1:02:46.080 --> 1:02:50.080]  that they don't even remember things like infowars.com
[1:02:50.080 --> 1:02:53.080]  or drudgereport.com, that they're still websites.
[1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:57.080]  We have our own video production, audio production, research, reporters,
[1:02:57.080 --> 1:02:59.080]  millions and millions and millions of people.
[1:02:59.080 --> 1:03:02.080]  We conservatively reach three to four million a day
[1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:04.080]  with the radio show, this live,
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:07.080]  and then millions and millions every day at Vandavidia.
[1:03:07.080 --> 1:03:09.080]  Millions.
[1:03:09.080 --> 1:03:13.080]  And if those millions went out and talked to people
[1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:15.080]  at a level that they could really get through their head
[1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:17.080]  that, you know, that censored info wars,
[1:03:17.080 --> 1:03:18.080]  the guy that I don't want you to hear,
[1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:20.080]  the guy that's been proven right about almost everything,
[1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:23.080]  he's still on the air on his own website.
[1:03:23.080 --> 1:03:24.080]  It's forbidden.
[1:03:24.080 --> 1:03:26.080]  It's infowars.com.
[1:03:26.080 --> 1:03:28.080]  You're not really able to share it online, they block it,
[1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:31.080]  but you can go there and you can word of mouth tell people
[1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:33.080]  about infowars.com.
[1:03:33.080 --> 1:03:36.080]  And I love people in the comments under this fella.
[1:03:36.080 --> 1:03:38.080]  This is just one example of it.
[1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:42.080]  I see it all the time, saying, yeah, he's at band.video.
[1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:43.080]  He's at getter.
[1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:44.080]  He's at rumble.
[1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:46.080]  He's at gab.
[1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:47.080]  And he's all right there.
[1:03:47.080 --> 1:03:51.080]  But notice, info wars red alerts as a fan had to put spaces
[1:03:51.080 --> 1:03:54.080]  because Twitter won't let you post those evil band words.
[1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:57.080]  infowars.com, band.video.
[1:03:57.080 --> 1:03:59.080]  You're not even allowed to put those URLs in,
[1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:03.080]  so we create new URLs like futurenews.news.
[1:04:03.080 --> 1:04:05.080]  They're already putting warnings on that on Twitter
[1:04:05.080 --> 1:04:07.080]  and Facebook and Instagram.
[1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:08.080]  Okay, fine.
[1:04:08.080 --> 1:04:12.080]  But you can for right now share futurenews.news
[1:04:12.080 --> 1:04:14.080]  because the truth is being suppressed
[1:04:14.080 --> 1:04:17.080]  and because it's the antidote like an antibiotic
[1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:19.080]  to a bad strep infection.
[1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:22.080]  You need to get it into your body, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:04:22.080 --> 1:04:25.080]  or vitamin D for your immunity before you get sick.
[1:04:25.080 --> 1:04:28.080]  Info wars is the vitamin D and the zinc
[1:04:28.080 --> 1:04:32.080]  and the hydroxychloroquine and the ivermectin
[1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:35.080]  and the sunshine of liberty.
[1:04:35.080 --> 1:04:37.080]  And you can carry the ball.
[1:04:37.080 --> 1:04:38.080]  Only you can.
[1:04:38.080 --> 1:04:40.080]  So just, I know you know where we're at.
[1:04:40.080 --> 1:04:41.080]  You found this, you're here.
[1:04:41.080 --> 1:04:43.080]  But the public's like, where's Alex Jones?
[1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:44.080]  Where's Alex Jones?
[1:04:44.080 --> 1:04:45.080]  You got to tell them.
[1:04:45.080 --> 1:04:48.080]  He's still on the air at band.video
[1:04:48.080 --> 1:04:49.080]  and infowars.com.
[1:04:49.080 --> 1:04:51.080]  You can't share those URLs most places.
[1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:52.080]  You got to tell them, word them out,
[1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:54.080]  and then tell them to tell others, creating what?
[1:04:54.080 --> 1:04:56.080]  The chain reaction.
[1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:01.080]  Sold out for months.
[1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:03.080]  X3 is now back in stock.
[1:05:03.080 --> 1:05:06.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing,
[1:05:06.080 --> 1:05:08.080]  our products are game changing,
[1:05:08.080 --> 1:05:11.080]  and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[1:05:11.080 --> 1:05:13.080]  It's not the soil anymore.
[1:05:13.080 --> 1:05:15.080]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[1:05:15.080 --> 1:05:18.080]  But when you get high quality triiodine,
[1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:20.080]  all three of the healthy types together,
[1:05:20.080 --> 1:05:23.080]  it does amazing things for your stamina,
[1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:26.080]  your libido, but most importantly, your immune system.
[1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:30.080]  So, X3, the only triiodine on the market,
[1:05:30.080 --> 1:05:33.080]  highest grade, is now exclusively available again
[1:05:33.080 --> 1:05:36.080]  at 50% off at infowars.com.
[1:05:36.080 --> 1:05:39.080]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine,
[1:05:39.080 --> 1:05:40.080]  and what it does for your body,
[1:05:40.080 --> 1:05:42.080]  it takes about two weeks to get it on average,
[1:05:42.080 --> 1:05:44.080]  you really need to experience X3.
[1:05:44.080 --> 1:05:46.080]  Those of you that have tried it and used it,
[1:05:46.080 --> 1:05:47.080]  I know you're going to be reordering it.
[1:05:47.080 --> 1:05:49.080]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product,
[1:05:49.080 --> 1:05:52.080]  you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body.
[1:05:52.080 --> 1:05:54.080]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen,
[1:05:54.080 --> 1:05:56.080]  and it funds the info award, a true 360 win.
[1:05:56.080 --> 1:06:00.080]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off.
[1:06:00.080 --> 1:06:26.080]  That is the eerie sound of the dreaded terrorist honking.
[1:06:26.080 --> 1:06:28.080]  Now, I could play you the city councils,
[1:06:28.080 --> 1:06:31.080]  the national government, the would-be dictator,
[1:06:31.080 --> 1:06:33.080]  who says he wants to be a dictator, Trudeau,
[1:06:33.080 --> 1:06:36.080]  denouncing them, saying they're terror, saying they're illegal,
[1:06:36.080 --> 1:06:38.080]  but you've probably already seen it.
[1:06:38.080 --> 1:06:40.080]  And listening and watching Trudeau is a little more
[1:06:40.080 --> 1:06:42.080]  than I could stomach today.
[1:06:42.080 --> 1:06:43.080]  But it's incredible.
[1:06:43.080 --> 1:06:45.080]  And they're like, how dare them blockade us?
[1:06:45.080 --> 1:06:47.080]  How dare them try to keep us from going out
[1:06:47.080 --> 1:06:49.080]  and try to bankrupt us and try to make us stand our homes
[1:06:49.080 --> 1:06:52.080]  when that's what they've been doing for two years
[1:06:52.080 --> 1:06:56.080]  to the Canadians through their nanny state garbage
[1:06:56.080 --> 1:06:58.080]  with the coronavirus they cooked up
[1:06:58.080 --> 1:07:00.080]  and they released on us through the Debo Scroop,
[1:07:00.080 --> 1:07:03.080]  through Klaus Schwab and his acolyte,
[1:07:03.080 --> 1:07:07.080]  his sworn servant that he brags that he owns.
[1:07:07.080 --> 1:07:11.080]  Klaus Schwab brags he owns, Trudeau.
[1:07:11.080 --> 1:07:14.080]  So joining us is Jeremy McKenzie,
[1:07:14.080 --> 1:07:16.080]  he's a former Special Forces officer,
[1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:18.080]  been on the show many years ago on other topics,
[1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:23.080]  and he is joining us here on air.
[1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:26.080]  He's also a popular podcaster.
[1:07:26.080 --> 1:07:29.080]  He's joining us to talk about the latest incredible developments,
[1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:32.080]  and we can air a little four minute video he put out last night
[1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:35.080]  that went viral about his police and military sources
[1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:38.080]  about the military crackdown that's about to happen.
[1:07:38.080 --> 1:07:40.080]  But instead he can just repeat that here for us now
[1:07:40.080 --> 1:07:42.080]  and give us some updates.
[1:07:42.080 --> 1:07:44.080]  There's been big developments since then.
[1:07:44.080 --> 1:07:47.080]  He's seeing all of the troops and military,
[1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:49.080]  some in plain clothes, some not,
[1:07:49.080 --> 1:07:51.080]  moving into the area, massive harassment,
[1:07:51.080 --> 1:07:54.080]  arresting and beating up old people that honk their horns.
[1:07:54.080 --> 1:07:55.080]  There's video of that.
[1:07:55.080 --> 1:07:57.080]  I mean, this is Tiananmen Square starting to unfold,
[1:07:57.080 --> 1:07:58.080]  ladies and gentlemen.
[1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:01.080]  The key is to not be violent like Mahatma Gandhi
[1:08:01.080 --> 1:08:05.080]  following the example of Christ or Martin Luther King Jr.
[1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:07.080]  And I'm just telling you, this is the time
[1:08:07.080 --> 1:08:10.080]  that they're going to destroy themselves doing this.
[1:08:10.080 --> 1:08:13.080]  And so he who shoots first loses.
[1:08:13.080 --> 1:08:15.080]  Same things happening in Australia and Europe,
[1:08:15.080 --> 1:08:17.080]  everywhere people are taking action.
[1:08:17.080 --> 1:08:23.080]  So Jeremy McKenzie at ragingdissonant.com joins us.
[1:08:23.080 --> 1:08:25.080]  Thank you so much, sir.
[1:08:25.080 --> 1:08:26.080]  How you doing, Alex?
[1:08:26.080 --> 1:08:27.080]  Thanks so much. Thanks for having me back.
[1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:28.080]  I just want to clarify.
[1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:29.080]  I wasn't an officer.
[1:08:29.080 --> 1:08:30.080]  I was an NCO.
[1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:31.080]  I was brief.
[1:08:31.080 --> 1:08:32.080]  You were a field marshal.
[1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:33.080]  You were a field marshal.
[1:08:33.080 --> 1:08:37.080]  Anyways, the point is let's get into exactly what is unfolding.
[1:08:37.080 --> 1:08:38.080]  Okay.
[1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:41.080]  So yeah, like as you were saying, it does appear.
[1:08:41.080 --> 1:08:43.080]  So there's supposed to be some negotiations happening
[1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:45.080]  with the organizers today.
[1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:47.080]  Right now, an hour ago,
[1:08:47.080 --> 1:08:49.080]  I haven't heard anything back from these guys.
[1:08:49.080 --> 1:08:50.080]  I'm waiting to see how that took place.
[1:08:50.080 --> 1:08:52.080]  They were expecting to meet with a delegation
[1:08:52.080 --> 1:08:54.080]  or some kind of representative from the federal government.
[1:08:54.080 --> 1:08:56.080]  The mayor of Ottawa is basically at his wit's end
[1:08:56.080 --> 1:09:00.080]  from what I've heard that he wants to settle one way or another.
[1:09:00.080 --> 1:09:01.080]  So that's what they're hoping for.
[1:09:01.080 --> 1:09:02.080]  I haven't heard anything back.
[1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:09.080]  However, it was fed to me from certain people inside the apparatus
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:12.080]  that there is a scenario on the table for mass arrests.
[1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:14.080]  They're busing in hundreds of federal police riot cops
[1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:16.080]  from the public order unit.
[1:09:16.080 --> 1:09:17.080]  I guess it's called the POU.
[1:09:17.080 --> 1:09:18.080]  I wasn't a cop.
[1:09:18.080 --> 1:09:20.080]  I'm learning as I go here.
[1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:24.080]  They're staging now and planning for this around the clock.
[1:09:24.080 --> 1:09:27.080]  Apparently, they're not very happy that I leaked that out there.
[1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:30.080]  They're cranky about that, but I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry.
[1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:32.080]  I forget to tell people.
[1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:33.080]  Spirits are high.
[1:09:33.080 --> 1:09:35.080]  People are holding the line here.
[1:09:35.080 --> 1:09:38.080]  There's more reinforcements, if you will, coming every day.
[1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:39.080]  It's families.
[1:09:39.080 --> 1:09:40.080]  It's truckers.
[1:09:40.080 --> 1:09:41.080]  It's farmers.
[1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:42.080]  It's blue-collar Canadians.
[1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:43.080]  There's kids down there.
[1:09:43.080 --> 1:09:44.080]  There's councils.
[1:09:44.080 --> 1:09:45.080]  There's free food.
[1:09:45.080 --> 1:09:47.080]  The homeless have never been more better fed in their lives.
[1:09:47.080 --> 1:09:49.080]  Crime has actually gone down in the city.
[1:09:49.080 --> 1:09:51.080]  And people that I know that live here say it's never been more pleasant
[1:09:51.080 --> 1:09:53.080]  to live in Ottawa as it is right now.
[1:09:53.080 --> 1:09:56.080]  And unfortunately, the honking will continue until freedom improves.
[1:09:56.080 --> 1:09:58.080]  That's just how it is.
[1:09:58.080 --> 1:10:01.080]  Well, expanding on that, for those that don't know,
[1:10:01.080 --> 1:10:05.080]  recap what the city council, what the central government,
[1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:06.080]  what they're all saying.
[1:10:06.080 --> 1:10:08.080]  I mean, they're calling people terrorists.
[1:10:08.080 --> 1:10:09.080]  They're calling them insurrectionists.
[1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:12.080]  They're saying racist or attacking and beating people.
[1:10:12.080 --> 1:10:13.080]  None of it's true.
[1:10:13.080 --> 1:10:15.080]  Of course, they never show the evidence.
[1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:17.080]  It's just unbelievable.
[1:10:17.080 --> 1:10:19.080]  Yeah, the federal government's been doing this.
[1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:22.080]  They've been fomenting hatred and division in the country for years now,
[1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:24.080]  and it's really ramped up the couple of months.
[1:10:24.080 --> 1:10:26.080]  And since this, you know, we've had BLM protests.
[1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:28.080]  We've had, you know, Indigenous People's protests and this kind of thing.
[1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:29.080]  They never had any issue with any of that.
[1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:30.080]  They're blocking pipelines.
[1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:33.080]  They were doing all kinds of stuff, trying to derail trains.
[1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:35.080]  But now, everyone's a terrorist because, coincidentally,
[1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:38.080]  it doesn't, you know, fit with the government's plans
[1:10:38.080 --> 1:10:39.080]  or their narrative, I suppose.
[1:10:39.080 --> 1:10:42.080]  And yeah, they were calling us terrorists, insurrectionists.
[1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:43.080]  Nothing could be further from the truth.
[1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:44.080]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[1:10:44.080 --> 1:10:46.080]  Yeah, that video there you're playing is a joke.
[1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:49.080]  You know, they're like, look at these violent truckers, you know.
[1:10:49.080 --> 1:10:52.080]  And yeah, they have no intention of negotiating with these people.
[1:10:52.080 --> 1:10:55.080]  It doesn't seem like I'm concerned it may be a trap of some kind.
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:10:56.080]  They're busing in a lot of cops.
[1:10:56.080 --> 1:10:58.080]  They're preparing to break this up by force.
[1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:02.080]  That's, allegedly, that's coming straight from the top of the government
[1:11:02.080 --> 1:11:04.080]  that they want this gone.
[1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:07.080]  And no one as of yet has even tried to speak to these people.
[1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:08.080]  There's been no crimes committed.
[1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:10.080]  No one, like, hardly, I don't know if there's even been any arrests.
[1:11:10.080 --> 1:11:11.080]  There's nothing like this is going on.
[1:11:11.080 --> 1:11:16.080]  Everything they're reporting is lopsided and incorrect, factually incorrect.
[1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:19.080]  And they're, you know, posting hoaxes.
[1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:22.080]  One of the guys from the Canadian anti-hate network
[1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:25.080]  tried to use a flyer that was posted in Miami,
[1:11:25.080 --> 1:11:28.080]  like an anti-Semitic, you know, kind of thing,
[1:11:28.080 --> 1:11:29.080]  and say that it was here in Ottawa.
[1:11:29.080 --> 1:11:32.080]  Like, blatantly, you know, demonstrably untrue, and yet they still do it.
[1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:34.080]  That's what the life goes.
[1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:35.080]  Yeah.
[1:11:35.080 --> 1:11:37.080]  It's the Solzhenitsyn quote, you know.
[1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:38.080]  They're lying.
[1:11:38.080 --> 1:11:39.080]  We know they're lying.
[1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:40.080]  They know that we know that they're lying.
[1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:42.080]  And, you know, we know that they know that we know that they're lying,
[1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:44.080]  and yet they still lie.
[1:11:44.080 --> 1:11:47.080]  That's a beautiful quote by Solzhenitsyn.
[1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:48.080]  What do you expect to happen?
[1:11:48.080 --> 1:11:52.080]  Because this isn't just your sources in the police that are telling you this.
[1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:54.080]  Trudeau's on TV saying this will not be tolerated.
[1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:55.080]  Their views are not tolerable.
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:11:58.080]  They're not acceptable views, is the quote.
[1:11:58.080 --> 1:12:02.080]  You have the city council with the police, you know, in these virtual meetings
[1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:04.080]  saying you will get out there.
[1:12:04.080 --> 1:12:05.080]  You will stop them.
[1:12:05.080 --> 1:12:06.080]  They are terrorists.
[1:12:06.080 --> 1:12:08.080]  They're using the word terrorist.
[1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:10.080]  And they're, I know, seizing people's gas cans.
[1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:12.080]  They're not letting people gas up their vehicles.
[1:12:12.080 --> 1:12:14.080]  They're calling it material support.
[1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:17.080]  Well, that's a term you use for supporting terrorists.
[1:12:17.080 --> 1:12:18.080]  Yeah.
[1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:21.080]  And, you know, the good people that we do still have in law enforcement
[1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:24.080]  are starting to kind of break ranks now, and they're disgusted by this,
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:27.080]  that they're seeing what they're seeing these police officers do.
[1:12:27.080 --> 1:12:29.080]  It's completely out of line.
[1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:30.080]  It's completely insane.
[1:12:30.080 --> 1:12:34.080]  And, yeah, that they're using intimidation tactics like this raid.
[1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:36.080]  You know, you've got the footage there.
[1:12:36.080 --> 1:12:39.080]  There was guys with, you know, like M4s.
[1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:41.080]  There was a guy with a tear gas grenade launcher.
[1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:44.080]  They're all dressed, you know, like show of force, right?
[1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:45.080]  It was a tense situation.
[1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:46.080]  There was families there.
[1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:47.080]  There was kids there.
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:48.080]  They were, it was nervous.
[1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:51.080]  You know, it wasn't a good time, apparently.
[1:12:51.080 --> 1:12:53.080]  There's no need of this.
[1:12:53.080 --> 1:12:55.080]  It's completely insane.
[1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:57.080]  All they want is to, you know, to be spoken to.
[1:12:57.080 --> 1:12:59.080]  And they're saying they want one of these crazy demands.
[1:12:59.080 --> 1:13:00.080]  They're trying to take over the country.
[1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:01.080]  They want the mandates gone.
[1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:03.080]  They want the vaccine passports gone.
[1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:05.080]  They want the vaccine passports and get rid of all of it.
[1:13:05.080 --> 1:13:06.080]  That's right.
[1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:08.080]  The news will never even say what the demands are.
[1:13:08.080 --> 1:13:09.080]  Stop the fake PCR test.
[1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:11.080]  Stop trying to put an experimental shot in us.
[1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:13.080]  And we don't want vaccine passports.
[1:13:13.080 --> 1:13:14.080]  We don't want the mark of the beast.
[1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:15.080]  We don't want this.
[1:13:15.080 --> 1:13:18.080]  I mean, these are valiant, good people saying don't discriminate against me
[1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:21.080]  because I don't want to take your big pharma product.
[1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:26.080]  That your prime minister has already bought out to 2026
[1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:29.080]  and is saying that he owns your body.
[1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:30.080]  Yeah.
[1:13:30.080 --> 1:13:32.080]  And he had some footage there from Coots, Alberta,
[1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:33.080]  Santa Alberta border.
[1:13:33.080 --> 1:13:36.080]  There's a huge situation going on there as well.
[1:13:36.080 --> 1:13:37.080]  People have come out in support.
[1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:39.080]  Like this is a national movement.
[1:13:39.080 --> 1:13:40.080]  This is a grassroots movement.
[1:13:40.080 --> 1:13:41.080]  It's happening all over the country.
[1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:44.080]  And it's a beautiful thing to see people come together like this
[1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:48.080]  and, you know, unite ironically above all of their differences together
[1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:51.080]  in opposition of this authoritarian government.
[1:13:51.080 --> 1:13:54.080]  You know, I couldn't be prouder of these people for what they're doing.
[1:13:54.080 --> 1:13:57.080]  And it's just, again, it's disgusting to see how they're treating this.
[1:13:57.080 --> 1:14:00.080]  And apparently all options are on the table still.
[1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:03.080]  Even just this morning, you had a liberal, I've been saying this for a little while.
[1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:05.080]  They're going to start jumping ship, one of the liberal MPs.
[1:14:05.080 --> 1:14:07.080]  I don't recall his name off the top of my head right now,
[1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:11.080]  but he's come out and condemned the prime minister and what they're doing.
[1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:15.080]  And the Republican or the, excuse me, the Tory or conservative leader up there,
[1:14:15.080 --> 1:14:18.080]  I know because he was going along with the lockdowns and the four shots.
[1:14:18.080 --> 1:14:22.080]  His party made him step down, correct?
[1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:23.080]  Yes.
[1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:26.080]  He was a completely weak, factless, you know, pointless, you know, leader.
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:28.080]  I wouldn't even use the term.
[1:14:28.080 --> 1:14:29.080]  He's been ousted now.
[1:14:29.080 --> 1:14:32.080]  We've got another guy that's going to, you know, try and get in there.
[1:14:32.080 --> 1:14:34.080]  I don't know if it's political opportunism or what's going on there,
[1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:36.080]  but the fact remains that this is a people's movement.
[1:14:36.080 --> 1:14:39.080]  This is a grassroots thing and it's pretty decentralized.
[1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:41.080]  And I don't, these guys are not going anywhere.
[1:14:41.080 --> 1:14:44.080]  They have no intention of going anywhere because they have nowhere to go back to.
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:46.080]  If this doesn't succeed, they lose everything.
[1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:47.080]  They lose their jobs.
[1:14:47.080 --> 1:14:48.080]  They lose their businesses.
[1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:49.080]  They can't go home.
[1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:53.080]  They're removing the wheels off of the trucks so they can't be towed anywhere.
[1:14:53.080 --> 1:14:57.080]  And now they're trolling the police because they're stealing Jerry cans.
[1:14:57.080 --> 1:15:01.080]  Guys are going around with empty fuel cans with, you know, writing on it that says,
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:06.080]  not gas, you know, and they're trying to ticket people and arrest people for carrying gas around.
[1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:08.080]  It's just desperation at this point.
[1:15:08.080 --> 1:15:11.080]  And there's no moves left that the state has that isn't going to make this worse.
[1:15:11.080 --> 1:15:18.080]  And by the way, if that crowd of 100,000 people that fluctuates in size really wanted to burn down the city, they could.
[1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:20.080]  I mean, if the people really want to take over, we can.
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:21.080]  We're not the criminals.
[1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:24.080]  We're not the left running around, burning everything down and shooting police.
[1:15:24.080 --> 1:15:27.080]  But if they, I want to come back and talk about this.
[1:15:27.080 --> 1:15:31.080]  If they do start attacking people, they fight back, then snipers shoot citizens.
[1:15:31.080 --> 1:15:33.080]  That's the way these dictatorships always fall.
[1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:37.080]  Trudeau is going to, I guess, get the dictator fate he keeps looking for.
[1:15:37.080 --> 1:15:40.080]  You know, after 10 days, he's emerged from hiding.
[1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:47.080]  And now some of his own protective detail in the Royal Mount of Police have been redesigning saying he's a tyrant.
[1:15:47.080 --> 1:15:49.080]  So you talk about moral courage.
[1:15:49.080 --> 1:15:59.080]  These people there, these truckers are the tip of the human spear worldwide and it's causing a chain reaction and we salute them.
[1:15:59.080 --> 1:16:01.080]  Sold out for months.
[1:16:01.080 --> 1:16:03.080]  X3 is now back in stock.
[1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:08.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing.
[1:16:08.080 --> 1:16:11.080]  And so many people are deficient in iodine.
[1:16:11.080 --> 1:16:13.080]  It's not the soil anymore.
[1:16:13.080 --> 1:16:15.080]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.

[1:17:34.080 --> 1:17:40.080]  AlphaGPC, a natural compound found in the brain that delivers an essential nutrient, Koli,
[1:17:40.080 --> 1:17:45.080]  and Ginkoli, which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant content.

[1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:50.080]  But right now, it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022, a little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at PrepareWithAlex.com
[1:18:50.080 --> 1:18:53.080]  on the entire catalog of my Patriot supply.
[1:18:53.080 --> 1:18:59.080]  Act now, get prepared now. This is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[1:19:02.080 --> 1:19:04.080]  Get our great bag of it here.
[1:19:04.080 --> 1:19:09.080]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the Communists?
[1:19:09.080 --> 1:19:15.080]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil,
[1:19:15.080 --> 1:19:20.080]  better than Guatemalan coffee. And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls Communists,
[1:19:20.080 --> 1:19:24.080]  but really, they're just a commune. And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[1:19:24.080 --> 1:19:28.080]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over. So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels.
[1:19:28.080 --> 1:19:31.080]  And I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[1:19:31.080 --> 1:19:35.080]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[1:19:35.080 --> 1:19:38.080]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:42.080]  It's Wake Up America Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:46.080]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[1:19:46.080 --> 1:19:49.080]  We had like that. You wouldn't believe it.
[1:19:49.080 --> 1:19:53.080]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[1:19:53.080 --> 1:20:13.080]  And if you don't find us, you don't want to share, that's fine.
[1:20:23.080 --> 1:20:51.080]  Jeremy McKenzie is a former Special Operations veteran.
[1:20:51.080 --> 1:20:56.080]  And he's a talk show host. It's popular. We've had him on years ago before all this started.
[1:20:56.080 --> 1:21:03.080]  And we've had him on, of course, recently from Canada, from Ottawa, the capital up there, beautiful area.
[1:21:03.080 --> 1:21:10.080]  And it is even more beautiful. The masses of people that are there on the ground peacefully honking
[1:21:10.080 --> 1:21:14.080]  and letting their voices be heard and saying, we don't want to be locked down.
[1:21:14.080 --> 1:21:18.080]  We don't want medical IDs. We don't want forced injections. We don't want to wear masks.
[1:21:18.080 --> 1:21:22.080]  We don't want to be locked in our houses under the Great Reset's martial law.
[1:21:22.080 --> 1:21:28.080]  You have the nastiest of all the world leader puppets, Trudeau, admitting he is a minion of Klaus Schwab
[1:21:28.080 --> 1:21:30.080]  and follows the Great Reset and build back better.
[1:21:30.080 --> 1:21:33.080]  And that this is good that there's a lockdown to cut our carbon
[1:21:33.080 --> 1:21:37.080]  and that he's introducing everyone to the new way of life. This is a damn cult.
[1:21:37.080 --> 1:21:41.080]  And then you have Schwab bragging that Trudeau is the greatest example.
[1:21:41.080 --> 1:21:44.080]  We have almost his whole cabinet under our control.
[1:21:44.080 --> 1:21:50.080]  We have half the world cabinets under our control. He brags on his own site, Klaus Schwab,
[1:21:50.080 --> 1:21:54.080]  head of the Bilderberg Group, that they control all these cabinets.
[1:21:54.080 --> 1:21:57.080]  So this is insane. This is a new type of warfare.
[1:21:57.080 --> 1:22:03.080]  So Jeremy McKenzie from RagingDissident.com, you also told my producer,
[1:22:03.080 --> 1:22:06.080]  I don't know if you want to get into this on air, that you've actually been followed around, stocked.
[1:22:06.080 --> 1:22:11.080]  There's a lot of crazy stuff going on. It's now in the news what you talked about last night.
[1:22:11.080 --> 1:22:15.080]  They're talking about cutting the cell stuff downtown.
[1:22:15.080 --> 1:22:19.080]  If the police move and they're talking about using the military as well,
[1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:24.080]  how do you expect this to unfold and what are your sources telling you?
[1:22:24.080 --> 1:22:29.080]  Yeah, so that was one of the aspects. Again, I was briefly with a special forces unit.
[1:22:29.080 --> 1:22:32.080]  They guys get sensitive about that kind of thing.
[1:22:32.080 --> 1:22:35.080]  I can't stand you military guys. Listen, I can't handle it.
[1:22:35.080 --> 1:22:37.080]  You know one reason I don't want to get military people on?
[1:22:37.080 --> 1:22:42.080]  Stop, stop, stop. You're hitting my pet pee right now. Fine, you were never in the military.
[1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:45.080]  Screw the military. I hate it.
[1:22:45.080 --> 1:22:49.080]  Please, God help me. God help me.
[1:22:49.080 --> 1:22:53.080]  I'm just telling people who you are because I was going to get into Afghanistan
[1:22:53.080 --> 1:22:56.080]  and talk about seeing freedoms being taken and then you tell me, don't say I'm this
[1:22:56.080 --> 1:23:00.080]  and then you say, don't say that. I don't care. Let's just say you're in Canada.
[1:23:00.080 --> 1:23:04.080]  Please help me. God help me right now.
[1:23:04.080 --> 1:23:09.080]  Go ahead. No, no, no. It's this thing you guys do because all the military people
[1:23:09.080 --> 1:23:12.080]  impact each other about who was what and who did what.
[1:23:12.080 --> 1:23:14.080]  Screw it all about that nuclear war. How about that?
[1:23:14.080 --> 1:23:16.080]  How about all the military people sitting on their ass with their thumbs up,
[1:23:16.080 --> 1:23:20.080]  their goddamn fucking asses doing nothing? How about that? Go ahead, man.
[1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:24.080]  There is a lot of great guys downtown. They're wearing their medals and stuff
[1:23:24.080 --> 1:23:26.080]  and thanks to those guys for showing up.
[1:23:26.080 --> 1:23:30.080]  So that is part of the plan. That's what they're hearing.
[1:23:30.080 --> 1:23:34.080]  Most of the guys are saying they're right next door to where this is nearby,
[1:23:34.080 --> 1:23:37.080]  to where these plans are being talked about. They would cut cell service.
[1:23:37.080 --> 1:23:40.080]  I would encourage anybody, your phone is your greatest weapon and your greatest defense.
[1:23:40.080 --> 1:23:43.080]  Film everything. You're not going to be able to livestream anything, probably,
[1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:48.080]  if they jam everything. Film as much as you can and try and get that out so the world sees what happens.
[1:23:48.080 --> 1:23:52.080]  That's really the MO here. Nobody here is going to be violent. Nobody wants violence.
[1:23:52.080 --> 1:23:56.080]  We're showing and demonstrating to the world how good the people of this country really are.
[1:23:56.080 --> 1:24:00.080]  I've never seen this level of unity and compassion for each other.
[1:24:00.080 --> 1:24:03.080]  I don't know how many people I've hugged in the last few days. It's insane.
[1:24:03.080 --> 1:24:07.080]  If they want to do this, I've always said, force a tyrant to act like one.
[1:24:07.080 --> 1:24:11.080]  If they want to send riot cops in here in full gear and tear gas,
[1:24:11.080 --> 1:24:16.080]  a bunch of families and kids and lock people up for wanting their lives back,
[1:24:16.080 --> 1:24:19.080]  for wanting to not have their jobs and their careers destroyed
[1:24:19.080 --> 1:24:21.080]  and want to be able to see their dying relatives in hospitals
[1:24:21.080 --> 1:24:25.080]  and not be robbed of the dignity of going to their own funerals and this kind of thing,
[1:24:25.080 --> 1:24:27.080]  is that really what these people want to do?
[1:24:27.080 --> 1:24:30.080]  The whole world is watching. They've got no moves left.
[1:24:30.080 --> 1:24:32.080]  They can give the people what they want.
[1:24:32.080 --> 1:24:35.080]  Like I said, they want the mandates gone, the testing, the passports,
[1:24:35.080 --> 1:24:38.080]  but more than that, they're here petitioning on behalf of every single person,
[1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:42.080]  all the first responders, all of the police, nurses, doctors, anyone that's been let go
[1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:45.080]  as a result of these mandates. They want their jobs back.
[1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:47.080]  Those are the demands and they're not unreasonable.
[1:24:47.080 --> 1:24:49.080]  Other countries have already dropped all of this.
[1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:54.080]  Many other countries have dropped this stuff because they know it's the writings on the wall here
[1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:59.080]  and these guys, probably because they are so personally invested in this scheme,
[1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:03.080]  this campaign, whatever it is you want to call it, they're very reluctant to let it go
[1:25:03.080 --> 1:25:06.080]  and they're malignant narcissists that are back into a corner,
[1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:08.080]  so that's the worrying part is how far are they willing to push this
[1:25:08.080 --> 1:25:15.080]  and I'm going to hope and hope to God that the better angels of our nature, as they say,
[1:25:15.080 --> 1:25:18.080]  that when push comes to shove and they order, if they order these cops to go in there,
[1:25:18.080 --> 1:25:21.080]  because they see us and we talk to them every day on the street and they know it's ridiculous.
[1:25:21.080 --> 1:25:26.080]  They said they've never seen a protest as peaceful and as wonderful as this is.
[1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:29.080]  You want to send these guys in there, I'm going to hope that maybe some of them,
[1:25:29.080 --> 1:25:32.080]  maybe a lot of them, maybe they just refuse to do it.
[1:25:32.080 --> 1:25:36.080]  I hear you brother and listen, I'm not mad at you or mad at anybody.
[1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:41.080]  I'm really pissed off about China and Russia and Putin threatening to nuke and nuclear war
[1:25:41.080 --> 1:25:44.080]  so I'm actually really on edge about that and just mad at everything
[1:25:44.080 --> 1:25:46.080]  and really pissed about what's happening there.
[1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:50.080]  I think my stress level's gone to another level here and I'm having trouble not blowing up.
[1:25:50.080 --> 1:25:54.080]  I had to take off some time last week and a few weeks ago because I'm just so pissed off
[1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:56.080]  and I'm trying to not get angry.
[1:25:56.080 --> 1:25:59.080]  How are you guys staying so friendly and peaceful?
[1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:02.080]  Because watching crap like this would make me get really mad.
[1:26:02.080 --> 1:26:07.080]  We have been for years and you know what, it was looking pretty dark there for a while
[1:26:07.080 --> 1:26:10.080]  but the images and stuff you're seeing, to see so many people, I get emotional.
[1:26:10.080 --> 1:26:12.080]  It's hard to even talk about.
[1:26:12.080 --> 1:26:16.080]  I bought some Canadian flag back there the first time in years
[1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:20.080]  and to see this, to see the country come back to life, I've compared it to like,
[1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:24.080]  you have a dying man or a brother on the battlefield who's got no heartbeat
[1:26:24.080 --> 1:26:26.080]  and you're trying to do everything to save him.
[1:26:26.080 --> 1:26:28.080]  That's the question I wanted to ask you because you brought this up years ago
[1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:30.080]  when you were on the show talking about tyranny in Canada
[1:26:30.080 --> 1:26:33.080]  that as a veteran you had some parallels to how upsetting it was
[1:26:33.080 --> 1:26:36.080]  to go supposedly fight for freedom overseas
[1:26:36.080 --> 1:26:38.080]  but then come back to your own country and see this happening.
[1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:40.080]  What's your take on that?
[1:26:40.080 --> 1:26:42.080]  Yeah, well now we're the bad guys.
[1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:46.080]  We're the criminals now because we believe in nationalism,
[1:26:46.080 --> 1:26:49.080]  we believe in our people and our culture and our history
[1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:51.080]  and they're trying to take all of that away.
[1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:54.080]  They're axing people like Don Cherry for sticking up for veterans on Veterans Day,
[1:26:54.080 --> 1:26:56.080]  this kind of thing.
[1:26:56.080 --> 1:27:00.080]  It's so sad but now like that guy who's dying on the field,
[1:27:00.080 --> 1:27:04.080]  you defib him and his heart comes back and he comes back to life
[1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:07.080]  and all of a sudden you're back in the game, you're seeing these people from all over the country,
[1:27:07.080 --> 1:27:11.080]  there's blockades everywhere, there's demonstrations in cities all over the country.
[1:27:11.080 --> 1:27:14.080]  So again, this isn't just Ottawa.
[1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:17.080]  The Windsor, the bridge there between Detroit and Ontario,
[1:27:17.080 --> 1:27:19.080]  there's a situation going on down there.
[1:27:19.080 --> 1:27:22.080]  Everything they do is only going to dig their own grave.
[1:27:22.080 --> 1:27:26.080]  Everyone is watching this and they know, they can see,
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:29.080]  there's 10,000 cell phones downtown taking pictures and video, getting it out to the world.
[1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:32.080]  The truth is out there, everyone that cares to look is going to see it.
[1:27:32.080 --> 1:27:34.080]  They know there's no Nazis down there.
[1:27:34.080 --> 1:27:37.080]  There was one guy with a Nazi flag, you know who took the picture of this guy,
[1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:40.080]  the Chateau, the hotel there, one of the most expensive ones downtown?
[1:27:40.080 --> 1:27:43.080]  The guy that took that photo was Trudeau's personal photographer.
[1:27:43.080 --> 1:27:45.080]  It was literally a literal false flag.
[1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:48.080]  And they talked about that, CBC ran with that for two solid days.
[1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:51.080]  Everybody knows, everybody knows this is nonsense.
[1:27:51.080 --> 1:27:53.080]  The mainstream media is being booed and chased out of places,
[1:27:53.080 --> 1:27:55.080]  and they're like, oh, we're just trying to do our job.
[1:27:55.080 --> 1:27:58.080]  Are you? Because most of the people I know don't have jobs anymore because of people like you,
[1:27:58.080 --> 1:28:00.080]  so I have no empathy for these people in the media.
[1:28:00.080 --> 1:28:03.080]  Well, Jeremy McKenzie, I really appreciate the great work you're doing.
[1:28:03.080 --> 1:28:07.080]  You do your own great show, ragingdissonant.com.
[1:28:07.080 --> 1:28:11.080]  I mean, if it's a plan on the table, do you have any percentage idea
[1:28:11.080 --> 1:28:15.080]  on if they're going to go in or when?
[1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:19.080]  I would guess, so negotiations were supposed to take place this afternoon.
[1:28:19.080 --> 1:28:21.080]  Again, just one of the organizers got back to me.
[1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:23.080]  He hasn't heard anything back yet.
[1:28:23.080 --> 1:28:28.080]  If that fails or nothing, I could guess potentially tonight, tomorrow night.
[1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:33.080]  I would guess they would probably move in late in the evening, early morning maybe,
[1:28:33.080 --> 1:28:35.080]  when there's the middle of the week, there's less amount of people here.
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:37.080]  They want this done before the weekend,
[1:28:37.080 --> 1:28:39.080]  because more and more people keep showing up on the weekends.
[1:28:39.080 --> 1:28:42.080]  People work, you know, and they want to come and be here.
[1:28:42.080 --> 1:28:45.080]  Jeremy McKenzie, ragingdissonant.com.
[1:28:45.080 --> 1:28:47.080]  I'm sorry, I have nothing to do with you.
[1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:49.080]  I'm on edge here. I might have to take a few days off again.
[1:28:49.080 --> 1:28:50.080]  No, I'm serious.
[1:28:50.080 --> 1:28:52.080]  Talking about going crazy here, it's pretty nice.
[1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:53.080]  God bless you, brother.
[1:28:53.080 --> 1:28:54.080]  We'll be back with Ted Anderson.
[1:28:54.080 --> 1:28:56.080]  You want to hear about the New World Order?
[1:28:56.080 --> 1:28:58.080]  You're about to learn about it.

[1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:03.080]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here,
[1:31:03.080 --> 1:31:06.080]  all over the world, from Australia to the United States,
[1:31:06.080 --> 1:31:08.080]  from Canada to Germany.
[1:31:08.080 --> 1:31:10.080]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do,
[1:31:10.080 --> 1:31:12.080]  everywhere you go, and then coming to your house
[1:31:12.080 --> 1:31:15.080]  and threatening, in some cases, actually taking people away
[1:31:15.080 --> 1:31:18.080]  into the night to their facilities.
[1:31:18.080 --> 1:31:20.080]  And they're planning in the next year
[1:31:20.080 --> 1:31:22.080]  to expand their shield process
[1:31:22.080 --> 1:31:24.080]  where they come and take, quote,
[1:31:24.080 --> 1:31:26.080]  healthy people away and put them in facilities
[1:31:26.080 --> 1:31:27.080]  for their safety.
[1:31:27.080 --> 1:31:29.080]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[1:31:29.080 --> 1:31:31.080]  And one big thing you can do to fight back
[1:31:31.080 --> 1:31:33.080]  is to get high quality Faraday cages,

[1:32:10.080 --> 1:32:12.080]  William in California, people are asleep
[1:32:12.080 --> 1:32:13.080]  and programmed controlled.
[1:32:13.080 --> 1:32:14.080]  I agree.
[1:32:14.080 --> 1:32:16.080]  How do you make the sleeper awaken, William?
[1:32:16.080 --> 1:32:17.080]  Hi, Alice.
[1:32:17.080 --> 1:32:18.080]  Thanks for taking my call.
[1:32:18.080 --> 1:32:20.080]  Can I plug Alice real quick?
[1:32:20.080 --> 1:32:21.080]  Yeah, go ahead.
[1:32:21.080 --> 1:32:25.080]  Hey, I'm in my 60s and I did the work of 25, 30 year olds
[1:32:25.080 --> 1:32:28.080]  and I worked them into the ground and you wanted to why.
[1:32:28.080 --> 1:32:30.080]  And I've tested this and I've taken your B12
[1:32:30.080 --> 1:32:32.080]  and let me tell you, when I don't take it,
[1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:33.080]  I pay a price.
[1:32:33.080 --> 1:32:34.080]  I really do.
[1:32:34.080 --> 1:32:37.080]  I take that B12 and I am electric, man.
[1:32:37.080 --> 1:32:38.080]  I can run 10 miles.
[1:32:38.080 --> 1:32:42.080]  I did some pretty heavy work with a highway department
[1:32:42.080 --> 1:32:45.080]  and my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah,
[1:32:45.080 --> 1:32:48.080]  for a guy in his 60s, you know, pushing 70,
[1:32:48.080 --> 1:32:51.080]  and I'm not just blowing smoke here.
[1:32:51.080 --> 1:33:17.080]  The B12 saves my life.
[1:33:17.080 --> 1:33:31.080]  Okay, so let me take you to the very front lines
[1:33:31.080 --> 1:33:34.080]  of censorship and deplatforming and debanking
[1:33:34.080 --> 1:33:37.080]  and really similar things to what we've seen
[1:33:37.080 --> 1:33:39.080]  in the Soviet and Nazi regimes
[1:33:39.080 --> 1:33:42.080]  where they first take away people's ability
[1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:44.080]  to have banks and then businesses
[1:33:44.080 --> 1:33:46.080]  and then they kick you out of your homes
[1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:48.080]  and put you in ghettos.
[1:33:48.080 --> 1:33:50.080]  Then they put you in forced labor camps
[1:33:50.080 --> 1:33:51.080]  and then when they're done with you,
[1:33:51.080 --> 1:33:52.080]  they put you in a death camp.
[1:33:52.080 --> 1:33:54.080]  And that's not just the Nazis that did that.
[1:33:54.080 --> 1:33:56.080]  This has been done all over the world.
[1:33:56.080 --> 1:33:58.080]  And with censorship and silencing,
[1:33:58.080 --> 1:34:02.080]  then comes arrest and imprisonment.
[1:34:02.080 --> 1:34:04.080]  And that's where we are.
[1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:07.080]  So you've seen the infiltration of the NRA
[1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:09.080]  when the NRA put TV shows on
[1:34:09.080 --> 1:34:11.080]  and was producing movies and ads
[1:34:11.080 --> 1:34:13.080]  and getting hardcore and getting political
[1:34:13.080 --> 1:34:16.080]  and really doing a great job thanks to Ted Nugent
[1:34:16.080 --> 1:34:19.080]  and others really cracking the whip in the last 10 years.
[1:34:19.080 --> 1:34:21.080]  Until about 10 years ago,
[1:34:21.080 --> 1:34:23.080]  the NRA was not as hardcore as it should be,
[1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:25.080]  but it got really hardcore and really good.
[1:34:25.080 --> 1:34:27.080]  And the IRS came after them,
[1:34:27.080 --> 1:34:29.080]  Leticia James came after them,
[1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:31.080]  working for Soros,
[1:34:31.080 --> 1:34:34.080]  and they're criminally going after them now.
[1:34:34.080 --> 1:34:36.080]  And they attack you in jurisdictions
[1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:38.080]  where they own it, like New York.
[1:34:38.080 --> 1:34:40.080]  So the NRA, why are they in New York?
[1:34:40.080 --> 1:34:42.080]  Well, they've been there since the end of the Civil War.
[1:34:42.080 --> 1:34:46.080]  When it was founded to train black people
[1:34:46.080 --> 1:34:49.080]  how to own and have guns to protect themselves in the south.
[1:34:49.080 --> 1:34:52.080]  On record, that's why the left calls it the KKK,
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:54.080]  because it's the opposite.
[1:34:54.080 --> 1:34:56.080]  The NRA has been bankrupted.
[1:34:56.080 --> 1:34:58.080]  The NRA basically pulled back its fangs
[1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:01.080]  and is now not being political and is a shadow of itself
[1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:03.080]  because of the infiltration, everything else.
[1:35:03.080 --> 1:35:05.080]  I know the inside baseball.
[1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:07.080]  They don't want it all out, but it was bad.
[1:35:07.080 --> 1:35:10.080]  Same things happen to us. We're a smaller organization.
[1:35:10.080 --> 1:35:13.080]  They had trouble, but they get infiltrators in.
[1:35:13.080 --> 1:35:16.080]  The infiltrators then lie about what's going on in your operation.
[1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:18.080]  They then sue you, Democratic Party,
[1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:22.080]  same law firm that sued Remington into bankruptcy.
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:25.080]  They then sue you, and then that data
[1:35:25.080 --> 1:35:28.080]  and that information they get when the judges order you to give them everything
[1:35:28.080 --> 1:35:30.080]  and has nothing to do with what they're suing you about,
[1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:33.080]  well, then they have a blueprint of what your operation is.
[1:35:33.080 --> 1:35:36.080]  And even when they discover that you don't have all this money,
[1:35:36.080 --> 1:35:38.080]  they don't care.
[1:35:38.080 --> 1:35:41.080]  I quote,
[1:35:41.080 --> 1:35:44.080]  unconditional surrender.
[1:35:44.080 --> 1:35:46.080]  They want us off the air.
[1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:49.080]  They want us to come out against America in the Second Amendment.
[1:35:49.080 --> 1:35:51.080]  Of course, we're not going to do that.
[1:35:51.080 --> 1:35:53.080]  But I see listeners comment on info or sometimes,
[1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:55.080]  you know, banned off video because I care about what you say,
[1:35:55.080 --> 1:35:58.080]  and people ask me in the street, hey, is it true you got hundreds of millions of dollars
[1:35:58.080 --> 1:36:00.080]  or, you know, I'm like, no, that's not true.
[1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:02.080]  I got, like, $400,000 in the bank
[1:36:02.080 --> 1:36:06.080]  and I sold my nice house to fund the operation
[1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:08.080]  because that was an investment to double my money
[1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:10.080]  in the last three years, buying a nice expensive house,
[1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:12.080]  knowing the awesome market.
[1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:16.080]  I did that so that I could then use that money to fight.
[1:36:16.080 --> 1:36:19.080]  And it meant nothing to me to sell my house to fight the tyrants.
[1:36:19.080 --> 1:36:20.080]  That's what I did it for.
[1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:23.080]  But the point is, people need to know,
[1:36:23.080 --> 1:36:25.080]  and I'm going to start in the days and weeks ahead
[1:36:25.080 --> 1:36:30.080]  to reveal this stuff to you because we've got incredibly damning stuff
[1:36:30.080 --> 1:36:32.080]  of what's really happened.
[1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:34.080]  Now, and we'll probably have to move Joel Scowson back 10 minutes
[1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:36.080]  to the next hour, he'll understand as I got Ted on a little late.
[1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:38.080]  I've got to cover this.
[1:36:38.080 --> 1:36:40.080]  And it's the reason last segment I got a little mad,
[1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:41.080]  not at the guest.
[1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:44.080]  I was just already so pissed about this, thinking about it in my mind
[1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:46.080]  that I just snapped and I apologize for that
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:50.080]  because it isn't Alex Jones that's angry because Alex Jones is under attack.
[1:36:50.080 --> 1:36:52.080]  I'm a fighter. I expect this.
[1:36:52.080 --> 1:36:54.080]  It's knowing that we're this far down the rat hole
[1:36:54.080 --> 1:36:56.080]  and this country is in this big of trouble,
[1:36:56.080 --> 1:36:58.080]  literally two minutes from midnight,
[1:36:58.080 --> 1:37:00.080]  thermal nuclear with Russia,
[1:37:00.080 --> 1:37:03.080]  and at every other level that just makes me have a rage
[1:37:03.080 --> 1:37:06.080]  and I pray to Jesus multiple times a day
[1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:09.080]  to give me peace and love to not blow up.
[1:37:09.080 --> 1:37:11.080]  That's why I've been preaching more love and more peace than ever
[1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:14.080]  because it's what we need here, folks, okay?
[1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:16.080]  I'm preaching to myself, not you.
[1:37:16.080 --> 1:37:18.080]  I'm sure some of you have the same problem.
[1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:23.080]  So what you're about to hear is only one small part of this
[1:37:23.080 --> 1:37:25.080]  and we're not going to release all of it yet.
[1:37:25.080 --> 1:37:28.080]  But Ted Anderson, I wanted him to just spend some time
[1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:30.080]  on who he is, what he's done.
[1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:34.080]  He was a sponsor of mine in 1997.
[1:37:34.080 --> 1:37:37.080]  A year later, he started the GCN radio network
[1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:40.080]  because he was already financing a bunch of shows.
[1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:42.080]  He already had a production thing producing his own shows.
[1:37:42.080 --> 1:37:44.080]  We're very popular on AMFM and Shortwave.
[1:37:44.080 --> 1:37:46.080]  In satellite, he said, why don't I start a network?
[1:37:46.080 --> 1:37:49.080]  When I got censored and kicked off my local radio station,
[1:37:49.080 --> 1:37:52.080]  he'd already set up his network a few years before
[1:37:52.080 --> 1:37:53.080]  and was getting it ready
[1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:56.080]  and I was already doing another show on it every day.
[1:37:56.080 --> 1:38:00.080]  And then about nine years ago, 10 years ago
[1:38:00.080 --> 1:38:02.080]  when the gold market was way down
[1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:05.080]  and Ted couldn't pay me anymore, I parted ways with Ted
[1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:08.080]  but instead you can still carry my show and syndicate it to stations.
[1:38:08.080 --> 1:38:09.080]  I'll syndicate myself.
[1:38:09.080 --> 1:38:11.080]  Two-thirds of my stations are with us
[1:38:11.080 --> 1:38:13.080]  and about 90-something are with him.
[1:38:13.080 --> 1:38:18.080]  And we're still friends, but he couldn't pay me anymore
[1:38:18.080 --> 1:38:21.080]  so I had to go out and try to syndicate my show more
[1:38:21.080 --> 1:38:24.080]  and try to get money in.
[1:38:24.080 --> 1:38:29.080]  He gets sued four years ago by the Sandy Hook Democrat lawyers
[1:38:29.080 --> 1:38:33.080]  and he had nothing to do with what I said on air or did
[1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:35.080]  and I was already off his network.
[1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:38.080]  He was only a satellite provider, but they don't care about that.
[1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:41.080]  And now we know, now they want the network itself
[1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:43.080]  and people say, well, keep fighting.
[1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:45.080]  Well, it takes money to fight them.
[1:38:45.080 --> 1:38:48.080]  Plus, Ted will have the floor here,
[1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:51.080]  but I just wanted to get this out now.
[1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:56.080]  Ted has been running this network with 700-plus affiliates
[1:38:56.080 --> 1:38:58.080]  and over 100 shows on it,
[1:38:58.080 --> 1:39:02.080]  but with Talk Radio and the implosion in the media and the economy
[1:39:02.080 --> 1:39:04.080]  for a couple of years it's been losing money,
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:06.080]  but because it's a pet project he started
[1:39:06.080 --> 1:39:08.080]  and because he's got other companies he can advertise on it,
[1:39:08.080 --> 1:39:11.080]  he keeps it propped up even though he's losing hundreds of thousands a year
[1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:13.080]  and that number is going up.
[1:39:13.080 --> 1:39:15.080]  Well, he can't defend a lawsuit against these people
[1:39:15.080 --> 1:39:18.080]  and so they say, that's fine, just give us your whole network.
[1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:20.080]  We want you to surrender.
[1:39:20.080 --> 1:39:22.080]  Thinking that would take me off the air,
[1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:24.080]  which it would be a crippling blow.
[1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:26.080]  But that's what this is all about, folks.
[1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:28.080]  This isn't just about shutting down our speech
[1:39:28.080 --> 1:39:30.080]  and misrepresenting what we said
[1:39:30.080 --> 1:39:32.080]  and connecting themselves to us to always say
[1:39:32.080 --> 1:39:34.080]  that I got famous off them when I didn't
[1:39:34.080 --> 1:39:37.080]  and they're literally using me to continue their anti-gun agenda.
[1:39:37.080 --> 1:39:39.080]  That is the lawyers in the media.
[1:39:39.080 --> 1:39:42.080]  And so imagine Ted Anderson has all these shows,
[1:39:42.080 --> 1:39:45.080]  liberal conservative, libertarian, veterinary shows,
[1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:49.080]  car shows, gardening shows, third largest syndicator in the country,
[1:39:49.080 --> 1:39:51.080]  but he's not a big megacorporation
[1:39:51.080 --> 1:39:54.080]  and his network's gone from making millions and millions of dollars
[1:39:54.080 --> 1:39:57.080]  at your profit to losing money, but he keeps it up there
[1:39:57.080 --> 1:39:59.080]  and keeps it running with the board ops,
[1:39:59.080 --> 1:40:02.080]  the engineers, the insurance and all the people.
[1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:04.080]  And then they come to him
[1:40:04.080 --> 1:40:06.080]  and Ted hadn't even told me this for a while,
[1:40:06.080 --> 1:40:08.080]  but then he just said, you know what, screw this,
[1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:10.080]  I'm not going to shut down.
[1:40:10.080 --> 1:40:13.080]  Quite frankly, Ted was planning to slowly shut down GCN.
[1:40:13.080 --> 1:40:15.080]  But because they're trying to shut him down
[1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:17.080]  and because they're trying to silence those other hosts,
[1:40:17.080 --> 1:40:19.080]  he was going to give them time.
[1:40:19.080 --> 1:40:22.080]  You know, if you had to down the road, I know to move other places.
[1:40:22.080 --> 1:40:25.080]  Now Ted's going to try to make GCN bigger than ever
[1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:28.080]  and stronger than ever, going to fight all the way through the end.
[1:40:28.080 --> 1:40:30.080]  And so he's here with us today, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:40:30.080 --> 1:40:33.080]  to talk about that, and I appreciate him holding while I was saying this,
[1:40:33.080 --> 1:40:35.080]  but I'm going to put this out on air right now.
[1:40:35.080 --> 1:40:37.080]  Let's put the URLs up, please.
[1:40:37.080 --> 1:40:41.080]  Ted's already spent $300 plus thousand dollars battling these people.
[1:40:41.080 --> 1:40:44.080]  Now to go to trial and fight him, it's going to cost him a half million dollars.
[1:40:44.080 --> 1:40:48.080]  He's already losing hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to fund this and keep it on air.
[1:40:48.080 --> 1:40:50.080]  And he's risking them getting judgments on him,
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:52.080]  even though he's totally innocent, if this happens.
[1:40:52.080 --> 1:40:54.080]  But he's an American and because of the First Amendment,
[1:40:54.080 --> 1:40:56.080]  he believes in it, he's going to do it.
[1:40:56.080 --> 1:40:59.080]  But he needs your help because after all these years and all the stuff,
[1:40:59.080 --> 1:41:01.080]  Ted is not a rich man.
[1:41:01.080 --> 1:41:03.080]  So save GCN.
[1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:06.080]  Well, you know, save GCN.com.
[1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:09.080]  It's also save GCNLive.com.
[1:41:09.080 --> 1:41:14.080]  And go there and make a donation, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:17.080]  because Ted needs to stay on air.
[1:41:17.080 --> 1:41:20.080]  And we don't want him to shut down.
[1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:22.080]  He needs to be able to stay on air.
[1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:26.080]  And I think once he gets all his other shows to plug that URL,
[1:41:26.080 --> 1:41:31.080]  and once he gets them to go and support it,
[1:41:31.080 --> 1:41:35.080]  that he'll actually get millions of dollars he needs to update his equipment
[1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:37.080]  and expand things and keep GCN going into the future.
[1:41:37.080 --> 1:41:39.080]  Because with the Internet kill switches and all this,
[1:41:39.080 --> 1:41:43.080]  all we've got, ladies and gentlemen, is AM and FM Talk Radio.
[1:41:43.080 --> 1:41:46.080]  And AM was obsolete in the 70s and 80s,
[1:41:46.080 --> 1:41:49.080]  but when there was no conservative radio and Rush Limbaugh came on,
[1:41:49.080 --> 1:41:52.080]  all those AM stations suddenly had great value.
[1:41:52.080 --> 1:41:55.080]  And so just like DVDs are coming back because of the censorship,
[1:41:55.080 --> 1:41:57.080]  we need to keep the AM and FM stations going.
[1:41:57.080 --> 1:42:00.080]  We need to support them as well, donate to them as well,
[1:42:00.080 --> 1:42:04.080]  and donate to the networks that have so many great shows on there telling the truth.
[1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:07.080]  So Ted Anderson for three segments will have the floor when we come back,
[1:42:07.080 --> 1:42:11.080]  but I want you to go to givesingo.com,
[1:42:11.080 --> 1:42:17.080]  and we'll put that URL back up there, savegcn.com, savegcn.com, one word,
[1:42:17.080 --> 1:42:19.080]  and go make a donation.
[1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:21.080]  Because Ted came to me and he said, you know,
[1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:26.080]  I need $300,000, $500,000 depending on what happens to go through this trial and all this.
[1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:29.080]  And he says, you know, I'm already losing a lot of money.
[1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:31.080]  Do you want to, you know, try to help me or what do you think I should do?
[1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:35.080]  And I said, Ted, by all means, do not turn the network over to these people
[1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:38.080]  so they can take all these people off the air and do this.
[1:42:38.080 --> 1:42:39.080]  Let's fight them.
[1:42:39.080 --> 1:42:42.080]  And he said, OK, so he needs to raise that money.
[1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:46.080]  That's how serious this is, is the gun grabbers also want our First Amendment
[1:42:46.080 --> 1:42:50.080]  and are literally trying to take radio networks off the air,
[1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:53.080]  and it's collateral damage to them if there's liberal shows on there as well.
[1:42:53.080 --> 1:42:57.080]  They want total power, total control to silence the American people.
[1:42:57.080 --> 1:43:02.080]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc
[1:43:02.080 --> 1:43:05.080]  are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:09.080]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system
[1:43:09.080 --> 1:43:11.080]  with a supplement that contains both.
[1:43:11.080 --> 1:43:15.080]  This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips
[1:43:15.080 --> 1:43:18.080]  should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[1:43:18.080 --> 1:43:23.080]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals
[1:43:23.080 --> 1:43:25.080]  that contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:43:25.080 --> 1:43:31.080]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[1:43:31.080 --> 1:43:36.080]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:38.080]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves,
[1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:42.080]  you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition,
[1:43:42.080 --> 1:43:45.080]  immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:43:45.080 --> 1:43:49.080]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate,
[1:43:49.080 --> 1:43:52.080]  even in affluent populations like here in America.
[1:43:52.080 --> 1:43:56.080]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com
[1:43:56.080 --> 1:43:58.080]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[1:43:58.080 --> 1:44:03.080]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement
[1:44:03.080 --> 1:44:07.080]  that is now available at infowarsstore.com.
[1:44:07.080 --> 1:44:11.080]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today,
[1:44:11.080 --> 1:44:14.080]  though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands
[1:44:14.080 --> 1:44:17.080]  for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[1:44:17.080 --> 1:44:19.080]  According to ancient Samoan legend,
[1:44:19.080 --> 1:44:23.080]  Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[1:44:23.080 --> 1:44:27.080]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[1:44:27.080 --> 1:44:30.080]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings
[1:44:30.080 --> 1:44:33.080]  and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[1:44:33.080 --> 1:44:38.080]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[1:44:38.080 --> 1:44:42.080]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend
[1:44:42.080 --> 1:44:46.080]  of not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including but not limited to
[1:44:46.080 --> 1:44:51.080]  German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Balerian Root.
[1:44:51.080 --> 1:44:54.080]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly,

[1:46:23.080 --> 1:46:25.080]  Goji berry alfalfa herb powder.
[1:46:25.080 --> 1:46:28.080]  It's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:33.080]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor
[1:46:33.080 --> 1:46:35.080]  and a touch of sea salt.
[1:46:35.080 --> 1:46:37.080]  It even tastes better than last formula.
[1:46:37.080 --> 1:46:39.080]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[1:46:39.080 --> 1:46:43.080]  Again, it has that cutting edge, chicken broth, protein,
[1:46:43.080 --> 1:46:46.080]  isolate powder for better flavor and solvability.
[1:46:46.080 --> 1:46:48.080]  You're going to love this.
[1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:50.080]  And what it does for your joints, what it does for your body,
[1:46:50.080 --> 1:46:52.080]  what it does for your bones is simply amazing.
[1:46:52.080 --> 1:46:54.080]  And it helps find the info war.
[1:46:54.080 --> 1:46:56.080]  This is really the best bone broth out there.
[1:46:56.080 --> 1:46:59.080]  So get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[1:46:59.080 --> 1:47:04.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[1:47:04.080 --> 1:47:06.080]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:47:15.080 --> 1:47:18.080]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, America is in a fight.
[1:47:18.080 --> 1:47:22.080]  The Western world is in a fight against multinational corporations
[1:47:22.080 --> 1:47:25.080]  that want to take over our lives and control everything we can see
[1:47:25.080 --> 1:47:26.080]  and what we can do.
[1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:28.080]  They want to control our bodies and put things in us.
[1:47:28.080 --> 1:47:30.080]  And at the very front lines of that fight,
[1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:34.080]  the very literal tip of the spear against the globalist is info wars.
[1:47:34.080 --> 1:47:37.080]  And we are their number one enemy because we understand their plans
[1:47:37.080 --> 1:47:40.080]  and because whether it's Joe Rogan or Tucker Carlson,
[1:47:40.080 --> 1:47:42.080]  or you name it, people really listen to us now
[1:47:42.080 --> 1:47:45.080]  and they understand that we know what we're talking about.
[1:47:45.080 --> 1:47:47.080]  We've been vindicated.
[1:47:47.080 --> 1:47:50.080]  We've been proven right.
[1:47:50.080 --> 1:47:52.080]  So Ted, I'm going to give you the floor here for the next 10 minutes.
[1:47:52.080 --> 1:47:54.080]  I'm not going to interrupt you.
[1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:59.080]  To talk about GCN, what's happened, what's going on,
[1:47:59.080 --> 1:48:03.080]  what these Democrat groups are doing,
[1:48:03.080 --> 1:48:05.080]  and what their real goal is.
[1:48:05.080 --> 1:48:08.080]  It's not the justice they claim for families or children
[1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:10.080]  for us questioning public events.
[1:48:10.080 --> 1:48:12.080]  I mean, hell, now the AP questions
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:15.080]  whether Russia is really going to launch a false flag.
[1:48:15.080 --> 1:48:18.080]  Everything, but really it's about taking everybody's free speech
[1:48:18.080 --> 1:48:21.080]  and all these shows, how many listeners you've got,
[1:48:21.080 --> 1:48:25.080]  how many affiliates, third largest radio network in the United States,
[1:48:25.080 --> 1:48:26.080]  and all of this.
[1:48:26.080 --> 1:48:27.080]  Ted, so I'm not going to interrupt you.
[1:48:27.080 --> 1:48:28.080]  So don't pause.
[1:48:28.080 --> 1:48:30.080]  You got 10 minutes, Ted.
[1:48:30.080 --> 1:48:31.080]  All right.
[1:48:31.080 --> 1:48:33.080]  Well, thanks, Alex, and I appreciate you having me up
[1:48:33.080 --> 1:48:38.080]  and certainly for the help with the Genesis Communications Network.
[1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:42.080]  And I got to say that the relationship that you and I have built
[1:48:42.080 --> 1:48:45.080]  over the years has been second to none.
[1:48:45.080 --> 1:48:50.080]  It's just amazing how much pressure that can be put on any kind
[1:48:50.080 --> 1:48:56.080]  of talk radio platform or anything that makes a difference nowadays.
[1:48:56.080 --> 1:49:02.080]  Right now, cancel culture is taking control of the point.
[1:49:02.080 --> 1:49:06.080]  I mean, people were applauding when they took you off of YouTube, Alex,
[1:49:06.080 --> 1:49:09.080]  and now all of a sudden they're taking everybody off of YouTube
[1:49:09.080 --> 1:49:11.080]  and they're sinking their own ship.
[1:49:11.080 --> 1:49:16.080]  Even Facebook had to change their name because they are losing
[1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:21.080]  their audiences and people are going away from that particular type
[1:49:21.080 --> 1:49:22.080]  of platform.
[1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:26.080]  The Genesis Communications Network happens to be a target as well.
[1:49:26.080 --> 1:49:30.080]  I mean, these people that have come in and created these platforms
[1:49:30.080 --> 1:49:32.080]  are like new kids to the block.
[1:49:32.080 --> 1:49:35.080]  And they think that they can go on and just kick people off
[1:49:35.080 --> 1:49:38.080]  and expect that the audience is going to continue to stay with them.
[1:49:38.080 --> 1:49:43.080]  So here we have a situation where you have this attorney group
[1:49:43.080 --> 1:49:48.080]  who actually, the father of one of the attorneys is actually a senator
[1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:51.080]  and there's a political movement to try to push away.
[1:49:51.080 --> 1:49:55.080]  I mean, the right to have a gun, the right to be able to speak freely.
[1:49:55.080 --> 1:50:01.080]  I mean, this is the very core of what the United States has been built on.
[1:50:01.080 --> 1:50:07.080]  And here we are watching censorship from a position of just
[1:50:07.080 --> 1:50:11.080]  canceling out complete radio shows like yours.
[1:50:11.080 --> 1:50:17.080]  And I find it completely interesting that they come in
[1:50:17.080 --> 1:50:21.080]  and they try to attack you by bringing you into a court,
[1:50:21.080 --> 1:50:27.080]  making you pay continued litigation costs until they just drain you dry
[1:50:27.080 --> 1:50:30.080]  and then all of a sudden you're forced to shut out of the business.
[1:50:30.080 --> 1:50:35.080]  Like you said, it's like they're looking for a full and complete surrender.
[1:50:35.080 --> 1:50:39.080]  They don't want to have platforms like yours.
[1:50:39.080 --> 1:50:42.080]  They don't want to have platforms like the Genesis communications
[1:50:42.080 --> 1:50:47.080]  network out there talking on a free level without fear to be able to say,
[1:50:47.080 --> 1:50:52.080]  hey, if I mentioned that, you know, that the Second Amendment counts
[1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:57.080]  and you can't have my guns, these people come after you.
[1:50:57.080 --> 1:51:02.080]  You know, that's probably why you're seeing the NRA backing off at this point in time.
[1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:07.080]  They're afraid to address these issues, to come right straight out
[1:51:07.080 --> 1:51:09.080]  and start talking about this stuff.
[1:51:09.080 --> 1:51:12.080]  It's like one of the few platforms that are out there right now
[1:51:12.080 --> 1:51:15.080]  is the Alex Jones Info Wars radio show.
[1:51:15.080 --> 1:51:17.080]  You know, Joe Rogan is another one.
[1:51:17.080 --> 1:51:22.080]  I mean, you know, to have Spotify have to consider
[1:51:22.080 --> 1:51:26.080]  whether or not they're going to have Neil Young or Joe Rogan.
[1:51:26.080 --> 1:51:28.080]  This shouldn't happen.
[1:51:28.080 --> 1:51:31.080]  We should be able to have free and free flowing information platforms.
[1:51:31.080 --> 1:51:33.080]  That's the way that it's supposed to work.
[1:51:33.080 --> 1:51:35.080]  That's why the United States was set up.
[1:51:35.080 --> 1:51:42.080]  We don't get sent to the gulags for trying to speak about, you know,
[1:51:42.080 --> 1:51:48.080]  non-narrative political, you know, messages.
[1:51:48.080 --> 1:51:53.080]  Just the whole coronavirus and the vaccines and the face masking
[1:51:53.080 --> 1:51:57.080]  and everything that has been going on makes you wonder, you know,
[1:51:57.080 --> 1:52:01.080]  all these truckers up in Canada that are protesting.
[1:52:01.080 --> 1:52:06.080]  And all that stuff put together just creates this environment
[1:52:06.080 --> 1:52:10.080]  where it's more dangerous to be able to speak
[1:52:10.080 --> 1:52:12.080]  than it is just to be able to do anything.
[1:52:12.080 --> 1:52:17.080]  You know, so if you don't have the support from the listeners
[1:52:17.080 --> 1:52:24.080]  actually, you know, coming in and helping with platforms like this one
[1:52:24.080 --> 1:52:27.080]  and your radio show, I just don't know how in the world
[1:52:27.080 --> 1:52:30.080]  that we're ever going to be able to survive this.
[1:52:30.080 --> 1:52:33.080]  And let's be clear, Ted, tell people again,
[1:52:33.080 --> 1:52:36.080]  because I want the exact numbers, I don't want to get it wrong,
[1:52:36.080 --> 1:52:40.080]  how long GCN has been around, how many affiliates you've got,
[1:52:40.080 --> 1:52:43.080]  and, you know, the fact that you've been running it for a couple years
[1:52:43.080 --> 1:52:46.080]  at a loss, because there's so much media out there,
[1:52:46.080 --> 1:52:48.080]  obviously talk radio has been in trouble,
[1:52:48.080 --> 1:52:50.080]  it's such a precious thing to support,
[1:52:50.080 --> 1:52:53.080]  give people the numbers of how big GCN is and how diverse the shows are,
[1:52:53.080 --> 1:52:57.080]  because I remember when I got censored with the number one show in Austin,
[1:52:57.080 --> 1:53:03.080]  you came and hired me and supported me and launched us into syndication
[1:53:03.080 --> 1:53:05.080]  and did an incredible job of me.
[1:53:05.080 --> 1:53:07.080]  So much of this revolution against tyranny,
[1:53:07.080 --> 1:53:09.080]  you get the credit for, Ted, and your tireless work,
[1:53:09.080 --> 1:53:12.080]  and then I know since Gold plunged 10 years ago
[1:53:12.080 --> 1:53:17.080]  and other things, you have just been pumping all your money in to keep GCN on,
[1:53:17.080 --> 1:53:19.080]  that's why we're here explaining this,
[1:53:19.080 --> 1:53:23.080]  that they are trying to take it over and are saying,
[1:53:23.080 --> 1:53:25.080]  just give us the network, we'll drop the suits against you,
[1:53:25.080 --> 1:53:28.080]  because they've now seen everything you're doing right now,
[1:53:28.080 --> 1:53:30.080]  know your finances right now, know you don't have a bunch of money,
[1:53:30.080 --> 1:53:34.080]  and they're saying, hey, just, you know, shut down and we'll drop our lawsuit against you,
[1:53:34.080 --> 1:53:41.080]  which is just absolutely amazing that this is going on, these people have no shame.
[1:53:41.080 --> 1:53:45.080]  Well, first of all, I mean, like we said, we started out with the, you know,
[1:53:45.080 --> 1:53:49.080]  you were over at what was a KJFK, I believe it was,
[1:53:49.080 --> 1:53:53.080]  and we started out with a shortwave radio station
[1:53:53.080 --> 1:53:57.080]  and a couple of AM and FM radio stations and built it into something huge.
[1:53:57.080 --> 1:54:03.080]  Genesis Communications Network right now has about 760 AM and FM radio stations
[1:54:03.080 --> 1:54:07.080]  across the United States with over 2,000 affiliate agreements,
[1:54:07.080 --> 1:54:10.080]  and we produce hundreds of radio shows,
[1:54:10.080 --> 1:54:13.080]  and you would think that the people would look at that kind of thing and go,
[1:54:13.080 --> 1:54:17.080]  wait a minute, this is just a broad spectrum of everybody's ideas.
[1:54:17.080 --> 1:54:21.080]  We're not trying to tell anyone what they have to say or what they have to do
[1:54:21.080 --> 1:54:25.080]  in order to have a platform on Genesis Communications Network.
[1:54:25.080 --> 1:54:29.080]  We're here to provide the signal to the radio stations
[1:54:29.080 --> 1:54:33.080]  and create a platform that people can rely on.
[1:54:33.080 --> 1:54:35.080]  And let's expand on that.
[1:54:35.080 --> 1:54:39.080]  They have defaulted us, even though you're a separate person, a separate company,
[1:54:39.080 --> 1:54:42.080]  even though we gave them everything they asked for so we don't get a real trial.
[1:54:42.080 --> 1:54:45.080]  We're guilty, now the jury decides how guilty.
[1:54:45.080 --> 1:54:51.080]  That's what's happening in America with you, with a very diverse radio network.
[1:54:51.080 --> 1:54:53.080]  And of course, what they wanted to find wasn't there.
[1:54:53.080 --> 1:54:55.080]  There wasn't some plan to talk about Sandy Hook.
[1:54:55.080 --> 1:54:59.080]  There wasn't any money made off of it. We barely ever talked about it. You never did.
[1:54:59.080 --> 1:55:02.080]  And I was already basically separated from you right around that time
[1:55:02.080 --> 1:55:06.080]  when that even went down because we had business disagreements, and that's on record.
[1:55:06.080 --> 1:55:09.080]  So imagine that, Ted, I said I wouldn't interrupt, but I can't help it.
[1:55:09.080 --> 1:55:13.080]  Imagine that, that this is actually going on in America.
[1:55:13.080 --> 1:55:17.080]  So yes, ladies and gentlemen, they plan on getting judgments too big to pay
[1:55:17.080 --> 1:55:20.080]  or too big to appeal because we can't get a bond for it or whatever
[1:55:20.080 --> 1:55:22.080]  because they know we don't have that much money.
[1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:27.080]  And then shut this place down with the constables, and they want to shut Ted down at the same time.
[1:55:27.080 --> 1:55:30.080]  They know we're on 300 affiliates.
[1:55:30.080 --> 1:55:32.080]  They know I'm on a bunch of cable and TV affiliates.
[1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:37.080]  They are so pissed, ladies and gentlemen, that we are reaching people and people are listening.
[1:55:37.080 --> 1:55:41.080]  So you folks, this is your fight. You cannot let them take GCN down.
[1:55:41.080 --> 1:55:44.080]  Ted could face a big judgment in these red cords, but he doesn't care.
[1:55:44.080 --> 1:55:47.080]  As long as he has the money to fight it, he's ready to go right through it,
[1:55:47.080 --> 1:55:49.080]  but he is literally running out of money.
[1:55:49.080 --> 1:55:55.080]  So save GCN, one word, SAVEGCN.com.
[1:55:55.080 --> 1:55:56.080]  That's give, send, go.
[1:55:56.080 --> 1:56:04.080]  And listen, when they took the $11 million away from the truckers at the big establishment,
[1:56:04.080 --> 1:56:07.080]  yeah, go fund me. When they took it away, go fund me.
[1:56:07.080 --> 1:56:10.080]  Now all those folks are going over to give, send, go because we and others told them to.
[1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:11.080]  Give, send, go.
[1:56:11.080 --> 1:56:12.080]  Servers are overweight.
[1:56:12.080 --> 1:56:13.080]  They're trying to expand.
[1:56:13.080 --> 1:56:17.080]  Everything's working fine, but it's a little bit slow because of the truckers,
[1:56:17.080 --> 1:56:19.080]  and that's great. People are moving to give, send, go.
[1:56:19.080 --> 1:56:21.080]  This is the only place we've got is give, send, go.
[1:56:21.080 --> 1:56:23.080]  We're even allowed to give us money.
[1:56:23.080 --> 1:56:28.080]  All the other places won't let you give to Christian or conservative or nationalist causes.
[1:56:28.080 --> 1:56:31.080]  So save GCN.com.
[1:56:31.080 --> 1:56:32.080]  Go there, please.
[1:56:32.080 --> 1:56:35.080]  About $2,000 has now been raised during this.
[1:56:35.080 --> 1:56:39.080]  Ted needs at least $300,000 to fight the next leg of this through trial,
[1:56:39.080 --> 1:56:42.080]  and he's rolling the dice even though he could get judgments against him,
[1:56:42.080 --> 1:56:46.080]  not backing down, not turning this important radio network over to the globalist.
[1:56:46.080 --> 1:56:50.080]  So go there now, savegcn.com.
[1:56:50.080 --> 1:56:54.080]  And listen, I could donate money to Ted's defense, and I'll do it if I have to,
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:55.080]  but I'm running out of money.
[1:56:55.080 --> 1:56:58.080]  That's why we have saveinfowars.com.
[1:56:58.080 --> 1:57:00.080]  We'll put that URL on screen.
[1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:02.080]  Saveinfowars.com.
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:06.080]  That also takes you to Give, Send, Go, where you can donate there.
[1:57:06.080 --> 1:57:10.080]  We've raised $360,000 on there.
[1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:12.080]  They did it to bankrupt this.
[1:57:12.080 --> 1:57:17.080]  We've got three trials coming up this summer, starting actually in March.
[1:57:17.080 --> 1:57:19.080]  Let's see, March, April.
[1:57:19.080 --> 1:57:22.080]  No, no, it's April, May, and March.
[1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:23.080]  No, I'm kidding.
[1:57:23.080 --> 1:57:25.080]  Point is, I'm going too fast here.
[1:57:25.080 --> 1:57:27.080]  Starting in April, May, and then June.
[1:57:27.080 --> 1:57:30.080]  Three trials, three different Sandy Hook people serving me in Austin
[1:57:30.080 --> 1:57:35.080]  to maximize the effect, the news coverage, you know, the power to bankrupt us,
[1:57:35.080 --> 1:57:39.080]  and then the big thing up in Connecticut that the Democrats and Senator Blumenthal run.
[1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:43.080]  I mean, this is literally what they're doing to silence you.
[1:57:43.080 --> 1:57:44.080]  They've got to get through us.
[1:57:44.080 --> 1:57:58.080]  So support us now.
[1:58:15.080 --> 1:58:20.080]  So, X3, the only tri iodine on the market, highest grade,

[1:58:30.080 --> 1:58:33.080]  you really need to experience X3.

[1:58:59.080 --> 1:59:01.080]  with eight beneficial super ingredients.

[1:59:05.080 --> 1:59:09.080]  Three of toxic additives each ingredient is specifically selected
[1:59:09.080 --> 1:59:11.080]  for its many key properties.
[1:59:11.080 --> 1:59:16.080]  Some of the proprietary super ingredients behind Brain Force Ultra include
[1:59:16.080 --> 1:59:20.080]  Garamaseed, which is loaded with energy compounds and antioxidants
[1:59:20.080 --> 1:59:23.080]  that have been used by Amazonian tribes for centuries.
[1:59:23.080 --> 1:59:26.080]  AlphaGPC, a natural compound found in the brain
[1:59:26.080 --> 1:59:29.080]  that delivers an essential nutrient, Co-Leap.
[1:59:29.080 --> 1:59:33.080]  And Ginko-Leap, which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant content.
[1:59:33.080 --> 1:59:37.080]  This product is more than twice the servings of our Brain Force Plus as well

[1:59:56.080 --> 1:59:58.080]  Brain Force Ultra
[1:59:58.080 --> 2:00:00.080]  Brain Force Ultra
[2:00:00.080 --> 2:00:05.080]  Brain Force Ultra
[2:00:23.080 --> 2:00:25.080]  Well, the quickening is here.
[2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:28.080]  I just received information in the last ten minutes
[2:00:28.080 --> 2:00:32.080]  that we knew was coming, but man, this is all coming down.
[2:00:32.080 --> 2:00:37.080]  After Ted leaves, I'm going to bring this up with Joel Scowles and Bushell.
[2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:40.080]  And I was reading the document.
[2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:44.080]  Bi-Chester Claire's terrorism threat due to false and misleading narratives
[2:00:44.080 --> 2:00:48.080]  and conspiracy theories, they go on in the document
[2:00:48.080 --> 2:00:51.080]  to say, unsanctioned speech is terrorism.
[2:00:51.080 --> 2:00:54.080]  They actually say that.
[2:00:54.080 --> 2:00:57.080]  Sanctioned means authorized by the government.
[2:00:57.080 --> 2:00:59.080]  Remember what Trudeau said last week?
[2:00:59.080 --> 2:01:04.080]  He said, these protesters hold unacceptable views and are terrorists.
[2:01:04.080 --> 2:01:08.080]  This is the global, I mean, I'm just...
[2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:12.080]  I mean, it's even sticking into me how dire the straits are
[2:01:12.080 --> 2:01:15.080]  and hopefully we back them off, hopefully we stop them peacefully.
[2:01:15.080 --> 2:01:20.080]  But all I can tell you is they use lawsuits against us
[2:01:20.080 --> 2:01:24.080]  to get the intel on how we operate, to then target everybody we're involved with
[2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:27.080]  to take us down and all we need is money.
[2:01:27.080 --> 2:01:30.080]  And I know I come to you constantly and I have people on trying to save starving Christians
[2:01:30.080 --> 2:01:33.080]  and I have other groups on. That's what we're doing here.
[2:01:33.080 --> 2:01:35.080]  It takes money to fight this war.
[2:01:35.080 --> 2:01:39.080]  And I want Ted to stay there and he's going to run ads
[2:01:39.080 --> 2:01:42.080]  for the rest of his great network and the other shows and his other shows.
[2:01:42.080 --> 2:01:47.080]  He'd get out there and say, hey, support our network and, you know, support GCN.
[2:01:47.080 --> 2:01:50.080]  So go to savegcn.com.
[2:01:50.080 --> 2:01:54.080]  That goes to give, send, go. Great Christian Patriots we can donate.
[2:01:54.080 --> 2:01:57.080]  And let's hit refresh on that, guys, on that page, please, so we can show people the new numbers.
[2:01:57.080 --> 2:02:02.080]  And donate today, ladies and gentlemen, at savegcn.
[2:02:02.080 --> 2:02:07.080]  Yeah, it's now almost three and a half thousand dollars.
[2:02:07.080 --> 2:02:10.080]  So thank you all for your support and also go to saveinfowars.com
[2:02:10.080 --> 2:02:13.080]  because believe me, folks, it takes millions of dollars to fight this war,
[2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:16.080]  toe-to-toe with the Democrats and the deep state and George Soros.
[2:02:16.080 --> 2:02:18.080]  And we're doing it. You want us to do it, we're doing it.
[2:02:18.080 --> 2:02:21.080]  You say we appreciate what we're doing, well, we've got to keep info wars on the air
[2:02:21.080 --> 2:02:26.080]  and I'm not about to watch them just celebrate and take over GCN.
[2:02:26.080 --> 2:02:28.080]  I mean, they might do it in a year, two years, whatever.
[2:02:28.080 --> 2:02:32.080]  We're fighting all the way to the end while other people build other infrastructure
[2:02:32.080 --> 2:02:34.080]  separate from us, but that's the answer.
[2:02:34.080 --> 2:02:37.080]  You think you'll get OAN? Other people are building three new networks.
[2:02:37.080 --> 2:02:42.080]  You think you'll get us? But we need time, ladies and gentlemen, time.
[2:02:42.080 --> 2:02:45.080]  And so that's what money is all about.
[2:02:45.080 --> 2:02:48.080]  That lets us have that shield while we're doing our broadcast
[2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:50.080]  and they're attacking trying to take us down.
[2:02:50.080 --> 2:02:52.080]  You keep us on air, you are the outreach.
[2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:55.080]  Go to saveinfowars.com and donate now.
[2:02:55.080 --> 2:02:59.080]  We need the support and go to savegcn.com as well.
[2:02:59.080 --> 2:03:03.080]  Do not wait. All right, Ted Anderson, please continue.
[2:03:03.080 --> 2:03:06.080]  Well, I mean, first of all, Alex will take your prayers as well,
[2:03:06.080 --> 2:03:09.080]  but it does take money in order to fight a lawsuit.
[2:03:09.080 --> 2:03:14.080]  Just to take a lawsuit is simple as the one that we have right here in front of Genesis.
[2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:19.080]  I'm being quoted about $300,000 just to get to the end of the lawsuit.
[2:03:19.080 --> 2:03:25.080]  If you lose the lawsuit, then you also have to pay whatever the settlement is at the very end as well.
[2:03:25.080 --> 2:03:29.080]  So it does take money and the people who are sitting here
[2:03:29.080 --> 2:03:33.080]  making sure that this broadcast is actually on air looks right.
[2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:35.080]  It's on the right satellite services.
[2:03:35.080 --> 2:03:40.080]  It's being played on the right radio stations and everything is being queued properly.
[2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:44.080]  That takes people and it takes paychecks and these people walk home
[2:03:44.080 --> 2:03:48.080]  and they have children, families, so on and so forth that they have to support as well.
[2:03:48.080 --> 2:03:54.080]  So yeah, it does take money and we never have asked for money before from our listeners.
[2:03:54.080 --> 2:04:00.080]  However, at this point in time, it is critical, critical that you get involved.
[2:04:00.080 --> 2:04:06.080]  Not only go to saveinfowars.com, but also go to savegcnlive.com.
[2:04:06.080 --> 2:04:10.080]  And I understand if you don't have any money, give us a prayer.
[2:04:10.080 --> 2:04:14.080]  Do something, get involved because this is the infowar.
[2:04:14.080 --> 2:04:19.080]  And quite frankly, if we don't do something, free speech will be gone.
[2:04:19.080 --> 2:04:25.080]  And after it's gone, then when you speak up, I mean, if you're in Russia right now,
[2:04:25.080 --> 2:04:30.080]  you say something against Putin, you're thinking about, am I going to go to the gulag?
[2:04:30.080 --> 2:04:32.080]  Am I going to be a free person?
[2:04:32.080 --> 2:04:35.080]  We don't want that to happen here in the United States.
[2:04:35.080 --> 2:04:38.080]  We want to be able to speak freely, speak our minds,
[2:04:38.080 --> 2:04:43.080]  and not be told that if we say the wrong words, we're going to have to go to prison.
[2:04:43.080 --> 2:04:44.080]  You're right, Ted.
[2:04:44.080 --> 2:04:48.080]  This is America's darkest hour and if they're able to silence us in this darkness,
[2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:50.080]  they're going to win, but the listeners understand that.
[2:04:50.080 --> 2:04:52.080]  We'll be right back to talk about this more than this huge news.
[2:04:52.080 --> 2:04:54.080]  We knew it was coming, but wow.
[2:04:58.080 --> 2:05:02.080]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock.
[2:05:02.080 --> 2:05:05.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game-changing,
[2:05:05.080 --> 2:05:10.080]  our products are game-changing and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[2:05:10.080 --> 2:05:11.080]  It's not the soil anymore.
[2:05:11.080 --> 2:05:16.080]  Most of the ocean is contaminated, but when you get high-quality triiodine,
[2:05:16.080 --> 2:05:21.080]  all three of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your stamina,
[2:05:21.080 --> 2:05:24.080]  your libido, but most importantly, your immune system.
[2:05:24.080 --> 2:05:29.080]  So, X3, the only triiodine on the market, highest grade,
[2:05:29.080 --> 2:05:34.080]  is now exclusively available again at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[2:05:34.080 --> 2:05:38.080]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body,
[2:05:38.080 --> 2:05:42.080]  it takes about two weeks to get on average, you really need to experience X3.
[2:05:42.080 --> 2:05:45.080]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it,
[2:05:45.080 --> 2:05:48.080]  but particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it
[2:05:48.080 --> 2:05:51.080]  because it's amazing what it does for your body, it's the good halogen,
[2:05:51.080 --> 2:05:55.080]  it's not the bad halogen, and it funds the info war, a true 360 win.
[2:05:55.080 --> 2:05:59.080]  So again, X3, back at stock.
[2:06:17.080 --> 2:06:22.080]  Well, the Democratic Party for their operatives have told us they want total surrender.
[2:06:22.080 --> 2:06:26.080]  They want us to not support the Second Amendment.
[2:06:26.080 --> 2:06:30.080]  They want us to just stand down and roll over to them,
[2:06:30.080 --> 2:06:35.080]  and they'll stop suing us in their reg courts.
[2:06:35.080 --> 2:06:40.080]  Well, in the words of John Paul Jones, the founder of the U.S. Navy,
[2:06:40.080 --> 2:06:44.080]  when the British ship twice their size said surrender, he said,
[2:06:44.080 --> 2:06:48.080]  I've only begun to fight, and of course he won.
[2:06:48.080 --> 2:06:52.080]  It does sicken me, though, that America has this much political rot,
[2:06:52.080 --> 2:06:54.080]  and these people are that authoritarian.
[2:06:54.080 --> 2:06:59.080]  And I've openly gone to my original radio network that still syndicates the show.
[2:06:59.080 --> 2:07:02.080]  I syndicate two-thirds of it. They syndicate the other third. They carry it
[2:07:02.080 --> 2:07:07.080]  because I didn't want to, you know, fully leave GCN right around 10 years ago
[2:07:07.080 --> 2:07:10.080]  because I liked Ted, and Ted stood up for me when we were the First Amendment issues
[2:07:10.080 --> 2:07:15.080]  and when I got fired from a local station for free speech and for what I was saying.
[2:07:15.080 --> 2:07:19.080]  And now they've come to him and said, we want your network. We want it all, period.
[2:07:19.080 --> 2:07:22.080]  They sued him along with me. They're not suing our radio stations.
[2:07:22.080 --> 2:07:24.080]  They can't do that. That's not even in the law.
[2:07:24.080 --> 2:07:27.080]  So the stations are fine, but they want the syndicator.
[2:07:27.080 --> 2:07:29.080]  Well, he wasn't technically the syndicator then. He was a carrier.
[2:07:29.080 --> 2:07:32.080]  But it doesn't matter. It's part of the next level of de-banking,
[2:07:32.080 --> 2:07:34.080]  de-platforming harassment.
[2:07:34.080 --> 2:07:36.080]  And so people are saying, oh, really?
[2:07:36.080 --> 2:07:41.080]  Oh, my God. I mean, part of me wants to just not fight this stuff and shut down.
[2:07:41.080 --> 2:07:46.080]  So people actually know how real this was. And then we'd be flooded with support
[2:07:46.080 --> 2:07:48.080]  to start something completely new.
[2:07:48.080 --> 2:07:51.080]  But I'm not going to give up with this great crew and do all this.
[2:07:51.080 --> 2:07:55.080]  I mean, part of me wants to just go, you know, lie on a beach while the world burns.
[2:07:55.080 --> 2:07:58.080]  But we can't do that because we were built for this moment.
[2:07:58.080 --> 2:08:01.080]  We were made for this. Everything we talked about is happening.
[2:08:01.080 --> 2:08:04.080]  DHS just came out. Huge article on infowars.com.
[2:08:04.080 --> 2:08:07.080]  I'll cover it with Ted Leaves saying, quote,
[2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:12.080]  unsanctioned speech is causing terror and needs to be banned.
[2:08:12.080 --> 2:08:16.080]  That's DHS, like I told you last June, but now it's official,
[2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:20.080]  declaring free speech terrorism.
[2:08:20.080 --> 2:08:24.080]  Saying we're going to have terror attacks as people are questioning open borders,
[2:08:24.080 --> 2:08:26.080]  election fraud and lockdowns.
[2:08:26.080 --> 2:08:31.080]  It now says it in the official bulletin.
[2:08:31.080 --> 2:08:35.080]  It says unsanctioned. You've got to have sanctioned speech.
[2:08:35.080 --> 2:08:40.080]  A bill where only approved media is allowed on major platforms,
[2:08:40.080 --> 2:08:43.080]  a law to ban unapproved stuff.
[2:08:43.080 --> 2:08:46.080]  The Democrats are trying to pass it in the house.
[2:08:46.080 --> 2:08:50.080]  It's sponsored by Pelosi. That's North Korea.
[2:08:50.080 --> 2:08:54.080]  So folks, we are overdone for a peaceful revolution in this country.
[2:08:54.080 --> 2:08:58.080]  We are cooked right now. This is insane.
[2:08:58.080 --> 2:09:04.080]  And Ted Anderson, that we're spending 300, 400, 500 thousand dollars
[2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:07.080]  in the last four years being signed on to this lawsuit with us.
[2:09:07.080 --> 2:09:09.080]  He gets defaulted even though he has his own lawyer,
[2:09:09.080 --> 2:09:12.080]  gave them all the stuff they wanted. They just count us all as one.
[2:09:12.080 --> 2:09:15.080]  You didn't give us anything, not through.
[2:09:15.080 --> 2:09:20.080]  Then they use all the contacts and info they got to then try to take us down.
[2:09:20.080 --> 2:09:25.080]  And they come to Ted and they say, turn over your old network to us
[2:09:25.080 --> 2:09:31.080]  with all those shows and 700 plus affiliates and we'll just leave you alone.
[2:09:31.080 --> 2:09:35.080]  Well, what do you do with the network? This is total surrender, just surrender it right now.
[2:09:35.080 --> 2:09:41.080]  And so Ted said, well, he told me, like I said, he was planning already to maybe phase out
[2:09:41.080 --> 2:09:45.080]  because of talk radio in decline and he's losing money,
[2:09:45.080 --> 2:09:47.080]  but he can also get some sponsors for his own products.
[2:09:47.080 --> 2:09:51.080]  He's on the fence and now this and Ted wants to fight.
[2:09:51.080 --> 2:09:54.080]  And so folks, he needs you to fight with him.
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:59.080]  This is so important. We need to see explosive giving at savegcn.com.
[2:09:59.080 --> 2:10:03.080]  He's at least 300,000 just through this one trial he's facing in Connecticut.
[2:10:03.080 --> 2:10:05.080]  Okay. And then he faces the judgment.
[2:10:05.080 --> 2:10:09.080]  He's willing to face that. He just needs the money for the fight.
[2:10:09.080 --> 2:10:11.080]  So he's a warrior for free speech. I wouldn't have been syndicated.
[2:10:11.080 --> 2:10:15.080]  Alex Jones wouldn't have had the success I've had if it wasn't for Ted Anderson.
[2:10:15.080 --> 2:10:17.080]  And I appreciate him being a fighter.
[2:10:17.080 --> 2:10:22.080]  So savegcn.com, savegcn.com and saveinfowars.com.
[2:10:22.080 --> 2:10:26.080]  Go there, make a donation. It takes millions to fight these people.
[2:10:26.080 --> 2:10:29.080]  And if folks would just give us big donations, if people would just support us,
[2:10:29.080 --> 2:10:31.080]  if they just step up and support us now,
[2:10:31.080 --> 2:10:35.080]  I wouldn't spend 30, 40% of my time trying to get money and plugging
[2:10:35.080 --> 2:10:37.080]  and messing the show up, having asked for help,
[2:10:37.080 --> 2:10:39.080]  but we won't be here if we don't do this.
[2:10:39.080 --> 2:10:42.080]  So buy products at infowarshtore.com.
[2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:46.080]  Get your storeable food 25% off from us right now at prepareloves.com.
[2:10:46.080 --> 2:10:50.080]  But the biggest thing we need is with food we're making with this discount,
[2:10:50.080 --> 2:10:53.080]  normally it's 30%, 25%, 20%.
[2:10:53.080 --> 2:10:56.080]  So yeah, millions of dollars come in, but it's hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[2:10:56.080 --> 2:10:57.080]  Fun things, doesn't do it.
[2:10:57.080 --> 2:10:59.080]  Same thing with supplements, okay?
[2:10:59.080 --> 2:11:01.080]  We make 50% or whatever on average.
[2:11:01.080 --> 2:11:03.080]  Other people mark it up way more.
[2:11:03.080 --> 2:11:06.080]  T-shirts, we might make $5 on them.
[2:11:06.080 --> 2:11:09.080]  But with this, you go give, you donate.
[2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:11.080]  We give 5%, they don't even ask for it.
[2:11:11.080 --> 2:11:13.080]  Give, send, go, so awesome, ask for nothing.
[2:11:13.080 --> 2:11:15.080]  We opt in to support them, an independent group,
[2:11:15.080 --> 2:11:18.080]  that now the truckers are using with 5%.
[2:11:18.080 --> 2:11:22.080]  And so they've gotten 5% of the $700,000 we've raised.
[2:11:22.080 --> 2:11:25.080]  Half of that was for Owen's defense, which it cost that to go to D.C.
[2:11:25.080 --> 2:11:27.080]  and have a criminal trial and face hold it.
[2:11:27.080 --> 2:11:28.080]  That's about what it costs.
[2:11:28.080 --> 2:11:30.080]  He's got the money he needs now.
[2:11:30.080 --> 2:11:31.080]  But what about infowars?
[2:11:31.080 --> 2:11:34.080]  It takes us millions, it's safe infowars to do this.
[2:11:34.080 --> 2:11:35.080]  That's why our goal is $2 million.
[2:11:35.080 --> 2:11:37.080]  We've raised 19% of what we need.
[2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:39.080]  This is a war, people.
[2:11:39.080 --> 2:11:41.080]  Ted Anderson, we got 5 minutes left.
[2:11:41.080 --> 2:11:42.080]  I really appreciate you.
[2:11:42.080 --> 2:11:44.080]  Just again, you said great things earlier.
[2:11:44.080 --> 2:11:47.080]  Other comments you'd like to impart to folks?
[2:11:47.080 --> 2:11:51.080]  Well, first of all, just think if you raise $9 million in this trucker thing,
[2:11:51.080 --> 2:11:54.080]  and the global elite come in and they say,
[2:11:54.080 --> 2:11:56.080]  hey, you've got to shut this down.
[2:11:56.080 --> 2:11:57.080]  And they shut it down.
[2:11:57.080 --> 2:12:00.080]  And these people are going to keep the money for themselves.
[2:12:00.080 --> 2:12:02.080]  Thank God they were down in Florida.
[2:12:02.080 --> 2:12:04.080]  It seemed like the Santa's gave us $5 million.
[2:12:04.080 --> 2:12:05.080]  That's right, go fund me, Ted.
[2:12:05.080 --> 2:12:08.080]  We're keeping the money for leftist groups until the Santa said that's criminal.
[2:12:08.080 --> 2:12:10.080]  I mean, that's how criminal the left is.
[2:12:10.080 --> 2:12:11.080]  Yeah, I know what.
[2:12:11.080 --> 2:12:12.080]  It's so what?
[2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:15.080]  They're going to come in and they're going to take the money
[2:12:15.080 --> 2:12:17.080]  and they're going to keep it for themselves.
[2:12:17.080 --> 2:12:20.080]  I mean, that's what cancel culture is all about.
[2:12:20.080 --> 2:12:23.080]  That's why you have to support the info wars.
[2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:26.080]  That's why you have to go to this.
[2:12:26.080 --> 2:12:29.080]  Save GCN.com and make your donation.
[2:12:29.080 --> 2:12:32.080]  I mean, this is an expensive fight.
[2:12:32.080 --> 2:12:34.080]  It takes money to go to court.
[2:12:34.080 --> 2:12:36.080]  You have to have attorneys.
[2:12:36.080 --> 2:12:39.080]  You have to go in and you have to do the depositions.
[2:12:39.080 --> 2:12:41.080]  And you have all these things that are happening.
[2:12:41.080 --> 2:12:44.080]  And by the time you hit the end, it costs a lot of money.
[2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:49.080]  Not to mention the fact you have to have employees in order just to keep
[2:12:49.080 --> 2:12:50.080]  the whole show on air.
[2:12:50.080 --> 2:12:54.080]  So yeah, without a question, if you can do that now at this point in time,
[2:12:54.080 --> 2:12:56.080]  go to save info wars.com.
[2:12:56.080 --> 2:12:59.080]  That's save info wars.com.
[2:12:59.080 --> 2:13:01.080]  Make a donation.
[2:13:01.080 --> 2:13:06.080]  And if you can do it, go to save GCN live.com and do it as well.
[2:13:06.080 --> 2:13:07.080]  We'll take your prayers.
[2:13:07.080 --> 2:13:08.080]  We need your donations.
[2:13:08.080 --> 2:13:10.080]  We need to fight this fight.
[2:13:10.080 --> 2:13:13.080]  If we don't fight, they're going to roll over us like steam rollers.
[2:13:13.080 --> 2:13:16.080]  Why would you want us to be crushed by this?
[2:13:16.080 --> 2:13:19.080]  This is one of the few bastions of truth.
[2:13:19.080 --> 2:13:24.080]  And anything else that's out there is getting shut down by cancel culture anyways.
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:25.080]  Right on.
[2:13:25.080 --> 2:13:26.080]  Absolutely.
[2:13:26.080 --> 2:13:30.080]  And that's why info wars has built its own satellite links, its own servers,
[2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:31.080]  its own infrastructure.
[2:13:31.080 --> 2:13:32.080]  We've been debanked.
[2:13:32.080 --> 2:13:33.080]  We've done it all.
[2:13:33.080 --> 2:13:35.080]  And we've gone through hell, but it's made it stronger.
[2:13:35.080 --> 2:13:39.080]  We're now the model of how to survive under these attacks.
[2:13:39.080 --> 2:13:42.080]  And now, I mean, literally the depositions, it's radio network satellites.
[2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:44.080]  Who is your satellite provider?
[2:13:44.080 --> 2:13:45.080]  Who are you on?
[2:13:45.080 --> 2:13:49.080]  It's all about targeting, just like an empire strikes back when they get,
[2:13:49.080 --> 2:13:52.080]  they go target, shield generator, maximum firepower.
[2:13:52.080 --> 2:13:55.080]  And that's what they want is to literally take us off here.
[2:13:55.080 --> 2:13:56.080]  They admit it.
[2:13:56.080 --> 2:14:02.080]  And because it's a military operation for them, they are conquering America right now.
[2:14:02.080 --> 2:14:03.080]  Yeah.
[2:14:03.080 --> 2:14:10.080]  And without a question, if something isn't done at this point, there won't be hope
[2:14:10.080 --> 2:14:12.080]  for free speech in the future.
[2:14:12.080 --> 2:14:17.080]  As far as I'm concerned, you can't go to YouTube and post a video unless you follow their rules.
[2:14:17.080 --> 2:14:21.080]  You can't go to Facebook and post a posting with unless you follow the rules.
[2:14:21.080 --> 2:14:24.080]  I mean, you do have to have your own servers.
[2:14:24.080 --> 2:14:26.080]  You have to have your own platforms.
[2:14:26.080 --> 2:14:29.080]  And both you and I have done that to start with.
[2:14:29.080 --> 2:14:32.080]  These guys weren't even available for us to use their platforms.
[2:14:32.080 --> 2:14:37.080]  When YouTube came out and you were able to post videos, it wasn't too long before they
[2:14:37.080 --> 2:14:41.080]  threw you off the air and that audience was not even able to find you.
[2:14:41.080 --> 2:14:46.080]  God, you have the services that you have now, the servers and everything you need.
[2:14:46.080 --> 2:14:47.080]  But that takes engineering.
[2:14:47.080 --> 2:14:48.080]  It takes staff.
[2:14:48.080 --> 2:14:49.080]  That's right.
[2:14:49.080 --> 2:14:52.080]  George Soros and Bloomberg on record have ordered us to be taken off the air and they've got
[2:14:52.080 --> 2:14:54.080]  armies of mercenaries trying to do it.
[2:14:54.080 --> 2:14:57.080]  And we don't have George Soros or Bloomberg or Senator Blumenthal.
[2:14:57.080 --> 2:14:59.080]  We have you listeners.
[2:14:59.080 --> 2:15:01.080]  So thank you so much for your support.
[2:15:01.080 --> 2:15:07.080]  Save GCN.com or Save Infowars, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:15:07.080 --> 2:15:11.080]  And that is how you support us because this is a major, major fight.
[2:15:11.080 --> 2:15:15.080]  I want to thank Brad Stuckey and all the folks that we see doing it.
[2:15:15.080 --> 2:15:17.080]  You are the tip of the spear and you are in this fight.
[2:15:17.080 --> 2:15:18.080]  This isn't just talk radio.
[2:15:18.080 --> 2:15:19.080]  This is entertainment.
[2:15:19.080 --> 2:15:24.080]  This is hardcore battling with the globalist, with the new world order.
[2:15:24.080 --> 2:15:26.080]  Ted Anderson, thank you so much.
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:27.080]  We'll get an update from you next week.
[2:15:27.080 --> 2:15:30.080]  And I really appreciate you standing up for us.
[2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:32.080]  I guess I've been working with you 26 years.
[2:15:32.080 --> 2:15:33.080]  How long is it?
[2:15:33.080 --> 2:15:36.080]  Oh, gosh, it's been about 26 years.
[2:15:36.080 --> 2:15:38.080]  What a wonderful 26 years, too.
[2:15:38.080 --> 2:15:40.080]  Great fight, I gotta tell you.
[2:15:40.080 --> 2:15:42.080]  Hey, we changed the world already with our listeners helping us.
[2:15:42.080 --> 2:15:43.080]  We did it together.
[2:15:43.080 --> 2:15:44.080]  Thank you.
[2:15:44.080 --> 2:15:45.080]  Save at GCN.com.
[2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:46.080]  Ted's not backing down.
[2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:47.080]  He's rolling the dice.
[2:15:47.080 --> 2:15:49.080]  He's making a big judgment on him.
[2:15:49.080 --> 2:15:51.080]  He just wants to be able to fight and tell the truth.
[2:15:51.080 --> 2:15:53.080]  He did nothing wrong but be an American.
[2:15:53.080 --> 2:16:21.080]  Stay with us.
[2:16:21.080 --> 2:16:47.080]  Thank you.
[2:16:47.080 --> 2:17:13.080]  Thank you.
[2:17:13.080 --> 2:17:39.080]  Thank you.
[2:17:39.080 --> 2:18:05.080]  Thank you.
[2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:31.080]  Thank you.
[2:18:31.080 --> 2:18:57.080]  Thank you.
[2:18:57.080 --> 2:19:23.080]  Thank you.
[2:19:23.080 --> 2:19:49.080]  Thank you.
[2:19:49.080 --> 2:20:15.080]  Thank you.
[2:20:15.080 --> 2:20:41.080]  Thank you.
[2:20:41.080 --> 2:21:07.080]  Thank you.
[2:21:07.080 --> 2:21:33.080]  Thank you.
[2:21:33.080 --> 2:21:57.080]  Thank you.
[2:21:57.080 --> 2:22:05.080]  Well, Alex, there's a lot of posturing going on, especially by Putin in that particular statement.
[2:22:05.080 --> 2:22:09.080]  He knows that the United States is not going to invade.
[2:22:09.080 --> 2:22:11.080]  Biden has already said it's off the table.
[2:22:11.080 --> 2:22:15.080]  There are going to be no troops coming into Ukraine.
[2:22:15.080 --> 2:22:17.080]  When it's attacked, they're going to let it fall.
[2:22:17.080 --> 2:22:18.080]  They're going to ring their hands.
[2:22:18.080 --> 2:22:20.080]  They're going to do sanctions.
[2:22:20.080 --> 2:22:27.080]  But I doubt if he's even going to be able to stop the gas pipeline coming in from Russia
[2:22:27.080 --> 2:22:34.080]  because the Germans are wedded to it and there's simply no way to handle their future gas needs.
[2:22:34.080 --> 2:22:40.080]  But I still don't believe that this is going to lead to nuclear war
[2:22:40.080 --> 2:22:44.080]  because the U.S. will not go to war with Russia over Ukraine.
[2:22:44.080 --> 2:22:45.080]  And that's good news.
[2:22:45.080 --> 2:22:54.080]  But on the other side, I remember you at least 20 years ago with your long-term strategic research
[2:22:54.080 --> 2:22:58.080]  that's really born out to be true, that the West would feign weakness
[2:22:58.080 --> 2:23:02.080]  and also have provocations with China and Russia to drive them together
[2:23:02.080 --> 2:23:07.080]  to do a joint attack on the United States, which will be used to wipe out the political opposition here
[2:23:07.080 --> 2:23:10.080]  and have the underground deep state emerge with its weapons
[2:23:10.080 --> 2:23:12.080]  and then form the fascist world government.
[2:23:12.080 --> 2:23:17.080]  And I remember you predicting right around 2022, 2023, 25.
[2:23:17.080 --> 2:23:20.080]  I know years later you moved it up a little, 2026, 2027.
[2:23:20.080 --> 2:23:24.080]  But my goodness, nobody, I'm not just praising you here.
[2:23:24.080 --> 2:23:25.080]  You're the only guy that did it.
[2:23:25.080 --> 2:23:31.080]  You laid out the scenario we're seeing now, but now you're saying it's not as bad or what's happening?
[2:23:31.080 --> 2:23:33.080]  No, I'm not saying it's not as bad.
[2:23:33.080 --> 2:23:38.080]  I'm just saying that in my military analysis, Russian China aren't quite ready yet.
[2:23:38.080 --> 2:23:43.080]  And, you know, they're just beginning to field their hypersonic weapons,
[2:23:43.080 --> 2:23:46.080]  and that's going to take a few more years to get it.
[2:23:46.080 --> 2:23:51.080]  They're still building their Blue Water Navy, which they have to do to control a global government
[2:23:51.080 --> 2:23:54.080]  that they intend to do so after they strike the West.
[2:23:54.080 --> 2:23:59.080]  But the reason I was able to key into the globalist plan
[2:23:59.080 --> 2:24:05.080]  is because the Presidential Decision Directive 60 signed in 1997.
[2:24:05.080 --> 2:24:09.080]  I started writing the World Affairs Brief in the year 2000,
[2:24:09.080 --> 2:24:13.080]  but I went on the Art Bell Show and exposed that,
[2:24:13.080 --> 2:24:18.080]  where it instructs our military forces to absorb a nuclear first strike,
[2:24:18.080 --> 2:24:22.080]  and then to retaliate afterwards.
[2:24:22.080 --> 2:24:26.080]  This got General Butch Neil to say, retaliate with what?
[2:24:26.080 --> 2:24:29.080]  You know, you got half of our submarines available, and why half?
[2:24:29.080 --> 2:24:33.080]  Because in that same year Clinton, instructed by executive order,
[2:24:33.080 --> 2:24:36.080]  50% of our submarines have to be imported any one time.
[2:24:36.080 --> 2:24:42.080]  And he clearly said to make the Soviets understand that we are not a threat,
[2:24:42.080 --> 2:24:45.080]  we are going to make ourselves more vulnerable.
[2:24:45.080 --> 2:24:49.080]  I mean, that's the kind of mentality that the globalist had during the Clinton administration.
[2:24:49.080 --> 2:24:54.080]  So they're trying to lure Russia and China into a sneak attack?
[2:24:54.080 --> 2:24:58.080]  Not only lure, but they've been building these two enemies.
[2:24:58.080 --> 2:25:02.080]  I mean, during the Nixon administration, we gave the Russians the miniature ball bearing technology,
[2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:04.080]  so they could merge their missiles.
[2:25:04.080 --> 2:25:10.080]  They couldn't do multiple independent missiles or warheads before,
[2:25:10.080 --> 2:25:15.080]  because they couldn't do the miniature gyros that are required to do the targeting.
[2:25:15.080 --> 2:25:19.080]  And Henry Kissinger told Nixon, you know, this isn't strategic,
[2:25:19.080 --> 2:25:21.080]  we can give it to the Russians.
[2:25:21.080 --> 2:25:26.080]  Just like we gave them the plans to the nuclear weapons that they couldn't steal from the Manhattan Project,
[2:25:26.080 --> 2:25:29.080]  we gave them the first shipment of enriched uranium.
[2:25:29.080 --> 2:25:33.080]  We brought China to power, we've allowed them to steal.
[2:25:33.080 --> 2:25:39.080]  We allowed them to have access to used aircraft and top secret military plans
[2:25:39.080 --> 2:25:42.080]  during the Clinton administration and others, so they could steal things,
[2:25:42.080 --> 2:25:44.080]  and they've been stealing things ever since.
[2:25:44.080 --> 2:25:48.080]  Now, what I'm just saying is the threat is not diminished.
[2:25:48.080 --> 2:25:54.080]  I'm just saying I don't think Ukraine is going to be a trigger event for World War III.
[2:25:54.080 --> 2:25:58.080]  Putin is clearly going to try to reconstitute the Soviet Union
[2:25:58.080 --> 2:26:03.080]  by taking back, starting with Ukraine, the former Soviet states.
[2:26:03.080 --> 2:26:07.080]  And Ukraine has been the subject of a lot of puppets.
[2:26:07.080 --> 2:26:12.080]  Timoshenko was a puppet, Poroshenko, Yanukovych,
[2:26:12.080 --> 2:26:16.080]  all of these prime ministers were puppets of Putin.
[2:26:16.080 --> 2:26:19.080]  The only one that isn't is a puppet of another oligarch,
[2:26:19.080 --> 2:26:22.080]  is Zelensky, the current president.
[2:26:22.080 --> 2:26:31.080]  And that's why he's trying to take over Ukraine now to put it under the growing Soviet ages.
[2:26:31.080 --> 2:26:36.080]  Remember, the Soviet Union faked their own collapse in 1990.
[2:26:36.080 --> 2:26:42.080]  They gave orders to let the wall come down, to let the riots go forward.
[2:26:42.080 --> 2:26:46.080]  They even gave orders for the communist dictators to step down.
[2:26:46.080 --> 2:26:51.080]  Ceaușescu of Romania was the only one who refused, and he and his wife were killed.
[2:26:51.080 --> 2:26:56.080]  Well, that's right, it's come out that 100% they staged that.
[2:26:56.080 --> 2:27:02.080]  So why is Biden fleeing out of Afghanistan and doing such a bad job?
[2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:04.080]  Why is he acting so weak?
[2:27:04.080 --> 2:27:08.080]  How does that help the globalist to have such an embarrassing puppet in there?
[2:27:08.080 --> 2:27:10.080]  What does that do?
[2:27:10.080 --> 2:27:14.080]  Well, in the first place, Afghanistan was essentially turned over to the Chinese.
[2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:17.080]  This is part of allowing the Chinese to make inroads
[2:27:17.080 --> 2:27:22.080]  and also to threaten Russia from its southern border.
[2:27:22.080 --> 2:27:27.080]  I mean, China is in control now of Afghanistan, including the essential minerals that are there,
[2:27:27.080 --> 2:27:34.080]  the oil and gas fields, and a lot of military equipment that we left behind.
[2:27:34.080 --> 2:27:37.080]  So it's a little bit difficult.
[2:27:37.080 --> 2:27:40.080]  I mean, as a military analyst to say, you know,
[2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:48.080]  why would you close down Bagram Air Force Base before you had evacuated everyone? It's just insane to do that.
[2:27:48.080 --> 2:27:54.080]  They clearly wanted to have a, you know, and Biden wouldn't know any difference.
[2:27:54.080 --> 2:27:58.080]  The military military told him, you know, let's go ahead and pull out this way.
[2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:00.080]  He doesn't know anything about military strategy.
[2:28:00.080 --> 2:28:05.080]  And so he wouldn't protest this, but it's the globalist military leaders that did this to us.
[2:28:05.080 --> 2:28:12.080]  And I think the secret plan behind it was to give more territory to China,
[2:28:12.080 --> 2:28:15.080]  which they already control Pakistan next door.
[2:28:15.080 --> 2:28:17.080]  And they've already into Iran.
[2:28:17.080 --> 2:28:19.080]  They're the primary supplier of Iran.
[2:28:19.080 --> 2:28:22.080]  So they've got the underbelly of Russia surrounded now.
[2:28:22.080 --> 2:28:24.080]  They aren't enemies right now.
[2:28:24.080 --> 2:28:27.080]  They're in temporary alliance to take down the West.
[2:28:27.080 --> 2:28:32.080]  But believe me, they're going to go after Russia eventually and this positions China
[2:28:32.080 --> 2:28:37.080]  to be able to pressure Russia during the next or the outcome of the World War Three,
[2:28:37.080 --> 2:28:40.080]  which they intend to succeed at.
[2:28:40.080 --> 2:28:44.080]  Exactly. And then China is making alliances with the Islamists,
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:46.080]  which they'll use in the Russian underbelly.
[2:28:46.080 --> 2:28:49.080]  We'll be right back with Joe Scowles and World Affairs Brief.com.
[2:28:49.080 --> 2:28:51.080]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[2:28:51.080 --> 2:29:03.080]  Visit and share those links. Stay with us.
[2:29:21.080 --> 2:29:31.080]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[2:29:51.080 --> 2:30:02.080]  Get our great bag of it here.
[2:30:02.080 --> 2:30:07.080]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[2:30:07.080 --> 2:30:12.080]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[2:30:12.080 --> 2:30:14.080]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[2:30:14.080 --> 2:30:18.080]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[2:30:18.080 --> 2:30:22.080]  they're just a commune. And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[2:30:22.080 --> 2:30:24.080]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[2:30:24.080 --> 2:30:26.080]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels.
[2:30:26.080 --> 2:30:29.080]  And I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[2:30:29.080 --> 2:30:33.080]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[2:30:33.080 --> 2:30:35.080]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[2:30:35.080 --> 2:30:39.080]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[2:30:39.080 --> 2:30:44.080]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[2:30:44.080 --> 2:30:51.080]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[2:30:51.080 --> 2:31:18.080]  And if you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[2:31:18.080 --> 2:31:25.080]  We're going to talk a little bit more about what we're going to find out about this operation.
[2:31:25.080 --> 2:31:29.080]  We're going to talk a little bit more about what we're going to find out about this operation.
[2:31:29.080 --> 2:31:36.080]  And if you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[2:31:36.080 --> 2:31:58.080]  And if you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[2:31:58.080 --> 2:32:05.080]  Why do my enemies hate me so much? Why do the globalists hate you so much? Why do they hate America so much?
[2:32:05.080 --> 2:32:12.080]  Because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot coexist with.
[2:32:12.080 --> 2:32:19.080]  It's very, very simple. For their world government, their anti-human, post-human, eugenic system to flourish,
[2:32:19.080 --> 2:32:25.080]  freedom and liberty and due process and justice and God fearing systems must fail.
[2:32:25.080 --> 2:32:31.080]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates. You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[2:32:31.080 --> 2:32:36.080]  You didn't start a fight with the UN. They started a fight with you.
[2:32:36.080 --> 2:32:45.080]  And they're not going to back down and they're not going to go away and they're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of God put into them.
[2:32:45.080 --> 2:32:51.080]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order or about globalism or about corporate taxes.
[2:32:51.080 --> 2:32:57.080]  It's not until people understand that and that we're under attack that we have any chance of beating these people.
[2:33:22.080 --> 2:33:28.080]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:33:28.080 --> 2:33:33.080]  So I've been accurate, no exaggeration on the big issues about 95% of the time.
[2:33:33.080 --> 2:33:36.080]  Joe Scalzen, I'd say, has been right about 98% of the time.
[2:33:36.080 --> 2:33:41.080]  But he thought we were going to have war with North Korea and it didn't happen.
[2:33:41.080 --> 2:33:44.080]  And I was glad he was wrong about that, but it came very close.
[2:33:44.080 --> 2:33:49.080]  I know folks that were actually involved at high level and mid level and they were told it was go as well.
[2:33:49.080 --> 2:33:55.080]  And those same people in the military now I talked to say they've been told, and I talked about this back six months ago,
[2:33:55.080 --> 2:34:01.080]  that by February we would see major escalations in Ukraine because they were already getting ready back then.
[2:34:01.080 --> 2:34:10.080]  So I hope Joe Scalzen is right when he says he doesn't think there's about to be some type of escalation of the conflict or a war.
[2:34:10.080 --> 2:34:16.080]  But when I see Putin saying, please listen to me, the media won't listen to me, you need to quote what I'm saying.
[2:34:16.080 --> 2:34:20.080]  And he says, yes, NATO can defeat us, but we have nuclear weapons.
[2:34:20.080 --> 2:34:26.080]  And by the time you can blink your eye, this is basically says, I'm paraphrasing it, that you'll be in a nuclear war.
[2:34:26.080 --> 2:34:27.080]  We're a nuclear power.
[2:34:27.080 --> 2:34:30.080]  So what is the point of that statement then, Joe?
[2:34:30.080 --> 2:34:33.080]  It sounds very desperate.
[2:34:33.080 --> 2:34:39.080]  No, it's to ensure that Biden won't go back on his pledge to not put US troops in Ukraine.
[2:34:39.080 --> 2:34:42.080]  It's to up the threat to a nuclear threat.
[2:34:42.080 --> 2:34:46.080]  But there's a couple of indications that what Putin said was absolutely wrong.
[2:34:46.080 --> 2:34:50.080]  In the first place, NATO cannot defeat Russia in a conventional war.
[2:34:50.080 --> 2:34:54.080]  I'm going to publish in next week's World Affairs Brief on Friday,
[2:34:54.080 --> 2:35:00.080]  an article by Scott Ritter, a very good military analyst from Europe that he's actually American,
[2:35:00.080 --> 2:35:03.080]  but he's done a lot of analysis over there.
[2:35:03.080 --> 2:35:11.080]  And he points out very, very clearly how Russian conventional forces are far superior to US now in terms of both tanks and especially artillery.
[2:35:11.080 --> 2:35:14.080]  And aren't they more cohesive as well?
[2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:15.080]  That's right.
[2:35:15.080 --> 2:35:17.080]  And they're up to our level in ECM.
[2:35:17.080 --> 2:35:20.080]  That's why they won't use their S-400 in Syria.
[2:35:20.080 --> 2:35:25.080]  They don't want us to get the radar signatures from their S-400 systems, et cetera.
[2:35:25.080 --> 2:35:27.080]  But here's what is interesting.
[2:35:27.080 --> 2:35:29.080]  Let me just correct one thing.
[2:35:29.080 --> 2:35:31.080]  I haven't yet predicted war with Korea.
[2:35:31.080 --> 2:35:37.080]  What I've said is that that will be the trigger event for World War III, and that still holds.
[2:35:37.080 --> 2:35:42.080]  And the reason I say that is because we've got 47,000 troops there.
[2:35:42.080 --> 2:35:45.080]  South Korea's got about 53,000.
[2:35:45.080 --> 2:35:47.080]  By the way, I wasn't trying to put you down.
[2:35:47.080 --> 2:35:52.080]  I just, you were thinking, before Trump got that so-called peace deal, that it was a...
[2:35:52.080 --> 2:35:55.080]  And I agree with you that they were planning an attack.
[2:35:55.080 --> 2:35:58.080]  Trump had given the order, but North Korea partially backed down.
[2:35:58.080 --> 2:36:02.080]  But I mean, remember, back at the time, you were thinking they were going to go ahead and do it.
[2:36:02.080 --> 2:36:08.080]  I don't recall that, Alex, because I never believed that Trump was actually going to use the military option.
[2:36:08.080 --> 2:36:10.080]  It was only a paper.
[2:36:10.080 --> 2:36:11.080]  Okay, well, I'm wrong. I apologize.
[2:36:11.080 --> 2:36:13.080]  Okay, but you got a perfect record then.
[2:36:13.080 --> 2:36:15.080]  So what do you think happens next?
[2:36:15.080 --> 2:36:16.080]  He never did go through that.
[2:36:16.080 --> 2:36:22.080]  But there is a threat related to North Korea that's coming up with the Taiwan situation with China.
[2:36:22.080 --> 2:36:32.080]  North Korea has said that if the U.S. intervenes militarily to stop China from taking Taiwan,
[2:36:32.080 --> 2:36:37.080]  that they will attack either South Korea or U.S. forces as a deterrent.
[2:36:37.080 --> 2:36:48.080]  So in other words, Pyongyang, Kim Jong-un has linked U.S. intervention to stop China from attacking Taiwan with a attack on South Korea.
[2:36:48.080 --> 2:36:58.080]  And that could trigger World War III because, you see, we would have to use tactical nuclear weapons to stop the overwhelming force that North Korea has in the South.
[2:36:58.080 --> 2:37:03.080]  They've got 60,000 artillery tubes pointed at Seoul.
[2:37:03.080 --> 2:37:08.080]  They've got, you know, a whole bevy of missiles that they could throw at us.
[2:37:08.080 --> 2:37:14.080]  Now, the air force isn't much to talk about, but their missile forces are far superior to South Korea.
[2:37:14.080 --> 2:37:21.080]  They could even hit Guam. They could even hit U.S. aircraft carriers steaming towards Taiwan.
[2:37:21.080 --> 2:37:26.080]  So this is a much more dangerous threat than the paper threat of Putin.
[2:37:26.080 --> 2:37:30.080]  And I recognize that Putin's threat was a paper threat when he talked about,
[2:37:30.080 --> 2:37:34.080]  you may be able to defeat us conventionally by NATO, and that just isn't true at all.
[2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:37.080]  NATO is a very weak conventional force.
[2:37:37.080 --> 2:37:47.080]  So what's going to happen here is that, first of all, I don't think the U.S. can effectively defeat China if it decides to take Taiwan.
[2:37:47.080 --> 2:38:00.080]  With the missiles that they have in stock there on the coast opposite Taiwan, they could obliterate Taiwan's military forces in about a day.
[2:38:00.080 --> 2:38:07.080]  And then with their invasion forces, they could probably take Taiwan within a week.
[2:38:07.080 --> 2:38:15.080]  And so it would take the U.S. two to three days to steam into that area to have an effective force,
[2:38:15.080 --> 2:38:17.080]  even though the airplanes could reach that sooner.
[2:38:17.080 --> 2:38:19.080]  So I don't think it's going to happen.
[2:38:19.080 --> 2:38:25.080]  And I think these two threats, Alex, by Putin about mentioning the nuclear possibility,
[2:38:25.080 --> 2:38:32.080]  and of South Korea, which we really fear because it is a real wild card,
[2:38:32.080 --> 2:38:39.080]  by them both threatening to intervene if the U.S. takes military action against either Russia or China,
[2:38:39.080 --> 2:38:46.080]  I think that's meant to simply ensure that we don't intervene because it's coming.
[2:38:46.080 --> 2:38:49.080]  What do you make of this China-Russia alliance?
[2:38:49.080 --> 2:38:56.080]  And that alliance really won't hold, we know, going back forever, Russia and China, that a lot of enmity between each other.
[2:38:56.080 --> 2:38:58.080]  Well, that's right, and it's still there.
[2:38:58.080 --> 2:39:02.080]  And China really is afraid of, I'm sorry, Russia is really afraid of China now.
[2:39:02.080 --> 2:39:04.080]  They know that they're bigger, stronger.
[2:39:04.080 --> 2:39:07.080]  They aren't as technologically advanced as Russia.
[2:39:07.080 --> 2:39:15.080]  And, you know, I was really shocked at Mike Flynn's discussion with Tucker Carlson when he talked about Russia being a paper tiger.
[2:39:15.080 --> 2:39:20.080]  He's been drinking the Kool-Aid that the globalists have been feeding them in the National War College things,
[2:39:20.080 --> 2:39:26.080]  but Russia is anything but a paper tiger, either conventional or nuclear-wise.
[2:39:26.080 --> 2:39:28.080]  They've got a lot more missiles than China.
[2:39:28.080 --> 2:39:30.080]  They've got 15 warheads.
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:34.080]  So, what do you make of Putin's pro-Christian talk and paying people to have children
[2:39:34.080 --> 2:39:38.080]  and GZPing three-child policy now and saying, no Sissy Man on TV?
[2:39:38.080 --> 2:39:40.080]  I mean, why do you think they're breaking?
[2:39:40.080 --> 2:39:41.080]  Oh, that's a big question.
[2:39:41.080 --> 2:39:42.080]  Why won't you want it?
[2:39:42.080 --> 2:39:47.080]  George Soros coming out and really doubling down and now the FBI doubling down on China.
[2:39:47.080 --> 2:39:50.080]  They denied China was a threat before.
[2:39:50.080 --> 2:39:52.080]  Why are they admitting it now?
[2:39:52.080 --> 2:39:55.080]  Well, first of all, let me answer the Putin question.
[2:39:55.080 --> 2:39:57.080]  This is meant to deceive.
[2:39:57.080 --> 2:40:05.080]  This is a major propaganda effort to deceive conservatives in the United States into thinking that Putin is our savior.
[2:40:05.080 --> 2:40:08.080]  And I get emails all the time about Putin is against the New World Order.
[2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:10.080]  Well, sure, he's against the New World Order.
[2:40:10.080 --> 2:40:20.080]  And he's been exposing, at least partially, the globalist in their support of ISIS in Syria, et cetera, by bombing those convoys.
[2:40:20.080 --> 2:40:27.080]  But the whole thing about Putin building churches and the support of Christianity is a total fraud.
[2:40:27.080 --> 2:40:35.080]  How many Americans would think that Clinton or Obama going to the National Cathedral and mentioning God was real?
[2:40:35.080 --> 2:40:37.080]  None of us would believe that.
[2:40:37.080 --> 2:40:44.080]  When Putin, who is an atheist, who has never been religious, starts to make waves.
[2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:52.080]  I mean, you've got to remember that during the Soviet days, the communists control all of the Orthodox churches.
[2:40:52.080 --> 2:40:55.080]  They control all of the top hierarchy of the Orthodox churches.
[2:40:55.080 --> 2:41:02.080]  So when Putin goes to Jerusalem and goes and bows down to shrines of Jesus, do you think that's all fake?
[2:41:02.080 --> 2:41:04.080]  It's all fake. It's all fake.
[2:41:04.080 --> 2:41:08.080]  I mean, you've got to remember the Soviets are masters of defeat, deceit.
[2:41:08.080 --> 2:41:10.080]  I mean, let's wake up people.
[2:41:10.080 --> 2:41:12.080]  The communism never fell.
[2:41:12.080 --> 2:41:14.080]  They never lost their atheism.
[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:16.080]  They're going to return to be as real as this.
[2:41:16.080 --> 2:41:20.080]  I've even had a subscriber say, why doesn't Ukraine just give in?
[2:41:20.080 --> 2:41:22.080]  It's not so bad living under Russia today.
[2:41:22.080 --> 2:41:27.080]  And I said, well, boy, you ought to read the books I've read about what happens when Russia returns.
[2:41:27.080 --> 2:41:32.080]  And they're even talking about prison camps for dissidents.
[2:41:32.080 --> 2:41:38.080]  You want to be one of those prisoners, you know, you just go along with a better read than dead type scenario.
[2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:42.080]  But, you know, it's very unfortunate what's going on there.
[2:41:42.080 --> 2:41:49.080]  And Ukraine is very divided because there are the Russians in the eastern portion of Ukraine that are pro-Russia.
[2:41:49.080 --> 2:41:51.080]  And they've drunk the Kulet too.
[2:41:51.080 --> 2:41:54.080]  They don't realize that the Soviet Union never really fell.
[2:41:54.080 --> 2:41:59.080]  They didn't even realize that it was a phony coup in 2014 during the Maidan Revolution.
[2:41:59.080 --> 2:42:06.080]  That it was Yanukovych that told the barricued, the secret, the riot police to stay in their barracks and let the protesters win.
[2:42:06.080 --> 2:42:15.080]  I mean, how many times, that's like Barack Obama or the deep state letting Trump supporters walk through the White House and opening the doors.
[2:42:15.080 --> 2:42:18.080]  Of course, they did in the large way and not prosecuting.
[2:42:18.080 --> 2:42:20.080]  Well, I know this and I'm not saying you're wrong.
[2:42:20.080 --> 2:42:25.080]  I think a lot of what you're saying is true, but Hollywood literally hates Rob Reiner, all of Putin.
[2:42:25.080 --> 2:42:32.080]  They literally hate at least as Christian rhetoric and he is paying people to have kids and that's a break with the Western elites.
[2:42:32.080 --> 2:42:36.080]  I mean, I think at least on the surface we're seeing that.
[2:42:36.080 --> 2:42:40.080]  Yeah, but he's persecuting all of the Protestant churches.
[2:42:40.080 --> 2:42:46.080]  Seventh-day Venice to Latter-day Saints and others are just being persecuted and closed down.
[2:42:46.080 --> 2:42:48.080]  So he's not a Christian.
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:52.080]  He's doing this to play to his own people.
[2:42:52.080 --> 2:42:55.080]  Let's shift gears to domestic when we come back.
[2:43:22.080 --> 2:43:32.080]  So, X3, the only tri-iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at InfoWarsHore.com.

[2:46:33.080 --> 2:46:49.080]  Four years, but right now it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022, a little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at PrepareWithAlex.com on the entire catalog of my Patriot supply.
[2:46:49.080 --> 2:46:57.080]  Act now, get prepared now. This is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[2:46:57.080 --> 2:47:07.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:07.080 --> 2:47:27.080]  All right, final segment with Joel Scowles. I'm going to host a little bit in the next hour with Wayne Allen Root who just interviewed Trump today and he invited me on to host with him. He's got some big news. Who knows what he brought to Trump? He's only been challenging Trump to have an intervention to stop pushing this so-called vaccine.
[2:47:27.080 --> 2:47:37.080]  It's really a poisonous gene therapy, but going back to the editor at worldoffirstbrief.com, Joel Scowles and Joel, the minutes we have left, the seven, eight minutes we have left.
[2:47:37.080 --> 2:47:47.080]  What do you make of the midterms? What do you make of Homeland Security coming out with a new report saying that unsanctioned news is creating terror?
[2:47:47.080 --> 2:48:05.080]  I mean, this reads like a joke. It's so authoritarian and I've got the bulletin right here saying the main terror threat is right-wingers and those that question the election. What do you make of this? What do you think happens in the next 273 days ahead of this midterm?
[2:48:05.080 --> 2:48:25.080]  Well, Alex, before I answer that, I want to make sure we get to the Reiner-Fulmick announcements this week. But in terms of the election, it's very important to understand that even though if there were fair elections, it would be an absolute slaughter for the Democrats in the midterm elections and in 2024 if they keep Joe Biden as president.
[2:48:25.080 --> 2:48:38.080]  And Kamala Harris is the same thing. Nobody likes her or trusts her. She's a giggling idiot. But there is still voter fraud and that's why they continue to push the scenario.
[2:48:38.080 --> 2:48:49.080]  Anyone who says there's a vote fraud is a domestic terrorist and they're painting the picture because that's exactly what's going to happen. There hasn't been any significant changes because we still have computer voting.
[2:48:49.080 --> 2:49:04.080]  And even though the Democrats did an awful lot of ballot harvesting and ballot stuffing in the box, etc., they still got the secret weapon which has never been fully exposed by any of the books on this is with vote fraud.
[2:49:04.080 --> 2:49:15.080]  They can flip votes. They can switch votes. They can make votes disappear, like the Edison data clearly showed, which Trump did not use, which Giuliani did not use to go before.
[2:49:15.080 --> 2:49:26.080]  It was the only evidence we had quantitatively of the vote fraud and nobody used it. It was just an incredibly sad story.
[2:49:26.080 --> 2:49:36.080]  So what's coming next? I mean, with the branding of the American people as terrorists for questioning elections, this is officially being done. I see false flags in the cards.
[2:49:36.080 --> 2:49:50.080]  Yeah, that's very possible. And that's why we've been predicting that they're going to sabotage the Canadian truckers' convoy. We could see sabotage of that in the Washington, D.C., U.S. convoy, the Australian convoy.
[2:49:50.080 --> 2:50:03.080]  Thank goodness the truckers are really standing up. You have to have it pretty bad for Americans to go to the streets and protest and they just haven't been awake.
[2:50:03.080 --> 2:50:12.080]  It's been very bad in Canada and that's what's enlivened the Canadians and it's been very, very bad in Australia and it's very bad in Austria and in Germany and France.
[2:50:12.080 --> 2:50:26.080]  And that's why with the vaccine passports, but we haven't really had those things rigidly enforced. So Americans are relatively asleep, but I'm afraid that the establishment is very much concerned about the power of the truckers.
[2:50:26.080 --> 2:50:37.080]  You know, you've got a huge multi-thousand pound rig that if you take the keys out and then you can't even tow it away and you park them bumper to bumper and you just can't move that kind of stuff.
[2:50:37.080 --> 2:50:45.080]  It's a real effective blockade of commerce as you're seeing on the photos right now.
[2:50:45.080 --> 2:51:01.080]  But I personally think that even with voter fraud, we're going to pick up seats in the house and we'll retain control of the Senate, but it won't be the complete slaughter that it would be if there were no vote fraud.
[2:51:01.080 --> 2:51:11.080]  And of course they are going to make it very sophisticated and get prepared to make sure that we don't win the presidency again in 2024.
[2:51:11.080 --> 2:51:14.080]  What else should we be watching out for?
[2:51:14.080 --> 2:51:28.080]  Well, I want to take a few minutes to talk about the Reiner-Fulmick supposed grand jury investigation that was on the television.
[2:51:28.080 --> 2:51:36.080]  He did all the right things in his presentation. He talked about the pre-planned pandemic, the dark winter, the event 201.
[2:51:36.080 --> 2:51:45.080]  I just gave a speech in Utah where I talked about the actual 10 wargaming that there were and the false pandemics.
[2:51:45.080 --> 2:51:49.080]  There were 13 false pandemics, including the 1976 virus.
[2:51:49.080 --> 2:52:02.080]  He mentions some of that. He talks about banning all the effective treatments so that they could justify putting forth an emergency authorization for a vaccine, which you can't do if there's any effective treatment.
[2:52:02.080 --> 2:52:08.080]  That's why they had to ban ivervector and hydroxychloroquine. He talks about vaccine damage.
[2:52:08.080 --> 2:52:16.080]  And last up half of his opening statement, he has the most complete list of experts and witnesses and doctors.
[2:52:16.080 --> 2:52:23.080]  Everyone that we've covered, you know, not only the World Affairs Brief, but you've interviewed, they're all there plus more.
[2:52:23.080 --> 2:52:28.080]  But there's one problem. This is not before a grand jury.
[2:52:28.080 --> 2:52:34.080]  This is not before a grand jury. He has not filed suit. He isn't going to be filed.
[2:52:34.080 --> 2:52:39.080]  These witnesses are not appearing before a grand jury. And I'm extremely disappointed.
[2:52:39.080 --> 2:52:46.080]  I've been waiting for over a year for him to fulfill his promise to file suit in the U.S. courts.
[2:52:46.080 --> 2:52:53.080]  And first of all, here's the evidence. First of all, you don't talk like he talks to a grand jury.
[2:52:53.080 --> 2:53:00.080]  It's also private. There's no filming of a grand jury. And so these cameras are not allowed in a real grand jury.
[2:53:00.080 --> 2:53:04.080]  He has never announced where he's filing this, where the grand jury is.
[2:53:04.080 --> 2:53:09.080]  The grand jury is a U.S. legal system only, not in Europe.
[2:53:09.080 --> 2:53:15.080]  And he hasn't filed suit in any legal thing that I've been able to find out.
[2:53:15.080 --> 2:53:23.080]  In addition, he talks about the putative defendants like Bill Gates and Dr. Fauci.
[2:53:23.080 --> 2:53:29.080]  That means the ones that we assume will be defendants. He talks about the public and dining.
[2:53:29.080 --> 2:53:36.080]  You see, if you're giving this to the public and he talks about us and we and this and you never talk that way before a grand jury.
[2:53:36.080 --> 2:53:43.080]  If you're giving an open statement to a grand jury, you talk about the evidence that you will prove by the factual witnesses.
[2:53:43.080 --> 2:53:49.080]  And you can't prove the general show. Let me throw this out because I mean, I covered this Saturday and Sunday this weekend.
[2:53:49.080 --> 2:53:52.080]  Heard large excerpts thought the info we put out was spot on.
[2:53:52.080 --> 2:53:59.080]  Like you said, I gathered that they were doing a people's grand jury, just like you have the 198 waves.
[2:53:59.080 --> 2:54:09.080]  The Pentagon talks about civil disobedience, nonviolent revolution as a way to put this on to then show grand juries and other bodies the blueprint for victory.
[2:54:09.080 --> 2:54:16.080]  I saw some statements out of them. Are you saying that you saw areas where it wasn't being clear or what's happening?
[2:54:16.080 --> 2:54:25.080]  Well, the entire Internet is alive with the false misimpression that he's actually filed suit and is sitting before a real grand jury.
[2:54:25.080 --> 2:54:28.080]  And I want to make sure people understand that isn't true.
[2:54:28.080 --> 2:54:31.080]  Oh, I got it. Absolutely. People have been calling me saying, hey, do you see the grand jury?
[2:54:31.080 --> 2:54:34.080]  And I said, no, they don't even have those in Europe. He's doing it.
[2:54:34.080 --> 2:54:40.080]  I guess that's the fine print as the model for other grand juries to then take action.
[2:54:40.080 --> 2:54:44.080]  Yeah, but you can't do that. In other words, what I'm saying is it's not a model.
[2:54:44.080 --> 2:54:46.080]  There never will be a grand jury in the first place.
[2:54:46.080 --> 2:54:49.080]  He should be filing a civil suit where you don't need a grand jury.
[2:54:49.080 --> 2:54:52.080]  Grand juries are very heavily controlled by prosecutors.
[2:54:52.080 --> 2:55:02.080]  They're just common citizens and they are like yes man to the prosecutors and it's very difficult to get a grand jury to really discuss the conspiratorial evidence.
[2:55:02.080 --> 2:55:07.080]  And you've got to have conspiratorial proof, which none of that opening statement requires.
[2:55:07.080 --> 2:55:10.080]  We all know it's true, but there's no way to prove it.
[2:55:10.080 --> 2:55:17.080]  You don't have NSA transcripts of collusion between Fauci and the vaccine manufacturers and the lie.
[2:55:17.080 --> 2:55:19.080]  You can't prove they're lying, etc.
[2:55:19.080 --> 2:55:21.080]  Then you have expert against expert.
[2:55:21.080 --> 2:55:27.080]  This would be a very difficult case except for the civil damages for vaccines, which would be fairly easy.
[2:55:27.080 --> 2:55:31.080]  But he's not doing that. That's what concerns me.
[2:55:31.080 --> 2:55:35.080]  But I agree the topics he covered was amazing.
[2:55:35.080 --> 2:55:37.080]  It's certainly informationally good.
[2:55:37.080 --> 2:55:39.080]  Absolutely.
[2:55:39.080 --> 2:55:43.080]  It's going to be beneficial, although it's a long watch.
[2:55:43.080 --> 2:55:51.080]  It's going to be hours and hours of testimony, which a lot of people like myself don't even have the time to dedicate to watch those things.
[2:55:51.080 --> 2:55:53.080]  We're watching and we've got crew on it.
[2:55:53.080 --> 2:55:55.080]  We're putting excerpts on Band-Aid video.
[2:55:55.080 --> 2:56:02.080]  Joel Scalzen, always informative, worldaffairsbrief.com. People can go there and I guess they can click on a button and send you an email.
[2:56:02.080 --> 2:56:04.080]  Or how do people get a free copy of it?

[2:56:14.080 --> 2:56:18.080]  All right. Thank you so much. Right there on the left-hand side, request a sample.
[2:56:18.080 --> 2:56:20.080]  Thank you, Joel.
[2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:21.080]  You're welcome.
[2:56:21.080 --> 2:56:28.080]  Hi folks. Wayne Allen Roots got some big news and he was going to be hosting the fourth hour, but he wants me to be on with him for some reason.
[2:56:28.080 --> 2:56:34.080]  I'm sure it's an important reason, so I'm going to be on the first segment, a long segment with him coming up.

[2:57:39.080 --> 2:57:46.080]  So please support infowarstore.com.
[2:57:46.080 --> 2:57:50.080]  Sold out for months. X3 is now back in stock.
[2:57:50.080 --> 2:57:58.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[2:57:58.080 --> 2:58:02.080]  It's not the soil anymore. Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[2:58:02.080 --> 2:58:11.080]  But when you get high quality tri iodine, all three of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido.
[2:58:11.080 --> 2:58:13.080]  But most importantly, your immune system.

[2:58:48.080 --> 2:58:56.080]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[2:58:56.080 --> 2:59:05.080]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, down and out, is just the thing.
[2:59:05.080 --> 2:59:12.080]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[2:59:12.080 --> 2:59:17.080]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, knockout, with down and out,
[2:59:17.080 --> 2:59:22.080]  now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[2:59:22.080 --> 2:59:27.080]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[2:59:27.080 --> 2:59:31.080]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower,
[2:59:31.080 --> 2:59:38.080]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[2:59:38.080 --> 2:59:44.080]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep, because you will be down and out.
[2:59:44.080 --> 2:59:47.080]  Selling out now at infowarstore.
[2:59:47.080 --> 2:59:54.080]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[3:00:05.080 --> 3:00:11.080]  Alright, Wayne Allen Root was on a few weeks ago with his intervention call for President Trump on the deadly vaccines,
[3:00:11.080 --> 3:00:18.080]  and that had a huge effect and got to Trump's ears, and Trump came out to criticising the force inoculations and the rest of it in the booster shots.
[3:00:18.080 --> 3:00:22.080]  So we'll see what his new news is. He just talked to Trump, I guess today, it hasn't aired yet.
[3:00:22.080 --> 3:00:29.080]  Now that's coming up next segment, but I got to tell you, this new document,
[3:00:29.080 --> 3:00:35.080]  I guarantee you, Owen Ferguson, will be covering this in an hour when the war room starts at 3 p.m. Central,
[3:00:35.080 --> 3:00:39.080]  and I read the whole thing out during these breaks, and man, is this amazing.
[3:00:39.080 --> 3:00:44.080]  It's unsanctioned information, it's causing terrorism,
[3:00:44.080 --> 3:00:47.080]  and openly attacks the First Amendment and says,
[3:00:47.080 --> 3:00:50.080]  Homeland Security's job is to shut up the American people,
[3:00:50.080 --> 3:00:55.080]  equating free speech with terrorism. Wow.
[3:00:55.080 --> 3:01:00.080]  Because they are planning, they're not planning, they've already done it in June of last year,
[3:01:00.080 --> 3:01:07.080]  to declare all opposition to lockdowns and force inoculations and open borders and election fraud as terrorism.
[3:01:07.080 --> 3:01:13.080]  They define that as white supremism, and they define white supremism as terrorism.
[3:01:13.080 --> 3:01:16.080]  It doesn't need to make sense, it isn't logic.
[3:01:16.080 --> 3:01:22.080]  That's how the system is dividing things, as it screws over the American people and the people of the world,
[3:01:22.080 --> 3:01:27.080]  just absolutely insane to have this going on, and here it is,
[3:01:27.080 --> 3:01:33.080]  Biden DHS declares terrorism threat due to false and misleading narratives and conspiracy theories online.
[3:01:33.080 --> 3:01:42.080]  Deep State working tirelessly to criminalize free speech as cover narrative collapses and freedom convoys spring up across the world.
[3:01:42.080 --> 3:01:48.080]  Joe Biden's Department of Homeland Security DHS declared a heightened terrorism threat due to several factors,
[3:01:48.080 --> 3:01:54.080]  including an online environment filled with false, misleading narratives and conspiracy theories.
[3:01:54.080 --> 3:02:02.080]  These are quotes. In other words, any speech or opinions of which DHS doesn't approve is now a terrorism threat.
[3:02:02.080 --> 3:02:07.080]  Read the tyrannical DHS National Terrorism Advisory Bulletin for yourself.
[3:02:07.080 --> 3:02:11.080]  Released last night, the United States remains in a heightened threat environment,
[3:02:11.080 --> 3:02:16.080]  fueled by several factors, including an online environment filled with false and misleading narratives.
[3:02:16.080 --> 3:02:19.080]  Of course, they tell you what's real and what's not.
[3:02:19.080 --> 3:02:22.080]  The State Department tells you that the Russians are going to stage a false flag,
[3:02:22.080 --> 3:02:33.080]  conspiracy theories and other forms of misdiss and mall information, MDM, including an or amplified by foreign and domestic threat actors.
[3:02:33.080 --> 3:02:37.080]  Domestic threat actors. Oh my goodness.
[3:02:37.080 --> 3:02:42.080]  That free speech, you're part of that domestic threat actor. Wow.
[3:02:42.080 --> 3:02:46.080]  These threat actors seek to exacerbate societal friction.
[3:02:46.080 --> 3:02:51.080]  What's the left doing to sow discord and undermine public trust in government institutions?
[3:02:51.080 --> 3:02:53.080]  What's the whole Black Lives Matter?
[3:02:53.080 --> 3:02:55.080]  Listen to this. This is exactly what they're doing.
[3:02:55.080 --> 3:03:00.080]  Total, total, total inversion, total complete projection.
[3:03:00.080 --> 3:03:08.080]  These threat actors seek to exacerbate societal friction to sow discord and undermine public trust in government institutions
[3:03:08.080 --> 3:03:12.080]  to encourage unrest, which could potentially inspire acts of violence,
[3:03:12.080 --> 3:03:18.080]  mass casualty attacks and or acts of targeted violence conducted by lone wolf offenders or lone offenders,
[3:03:18.080 --> 3:03:23.080]  a small group acting in the furtherance of ideological beliefs and or personal grievances.
[3:03:23.080 --> 3:03:27.080]  So when somebody does something bad and then says they're part of a group, you're all to blame.
[3:03:27.080 --> 3:03:29.080]  Classical authoritarianism.
[3:03:29.080 --> 3:03:34.080]  While the conditions underlying the heightened threat landscape have not significantly changed over the last year,
[3:03:34.080 --> 3:03:41.080]  the convergence of the following factors has increased the volatility, unprecedented, unprecedented ability,
[3:03:41.080 --> 3:03:45.080]  who's writing this, and complexity of the threat environment.
[3:03:45.080 --> 3:03:52.080]  Number one, the proliferation of false and misleading narratives that sow discord or undermine public trust in government institutions.
[3:03:52.080 --> 3:03:57.080]  Not allowed to do that. The government doing bad things didn't discredit itself. You did it.
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:04:01.080]  Two, continued calls for violence and directed at U.S. critical infrastructure.
[3:04:01.080 --> 3:04:04.080]  That's the left cutting off pipelines and burning everything down and saying,
[3:04:04.080 --> 3:04:06.080]  you know, get rid of gas engines.
[3:04:06.080 --> 3:04:11.080]  Soft targets, mass gatherings, oh my gosh, faith-based institutions that they shut down during the lockdowns,
[3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:18.080]  such as churches, synagogues and mosques, institutions of higher education, racial and religious minorities,
[3:04:18.080 --> 3:04:22.080]  groups, facilities and personals, including law enforcement and military.
[3:04:22.080 --> 3:04:25.080]  Well, the globalists are part of the military with deadly shots.
[3:04:25.080 --> 3:04:33.080]  The media, the perceived ideological opponents and calls for foreign terrorist organizations attacks the United States.
[3:04:33.080 --> 3:04:39.080]  And then it goes on to say, we're going to get to all of it, man, this is just insane.
[3:04:39.080 --> 3:04:45.080]  And the worst part is unapproved, unsanctioned narratives.
[3:04:45.080 --> 3:04:51.080]  They got a bill introduced to only let approved globalist media be on social media, period.
[3:04:51.080 --> 3:04:57.080]  Everything else barred by law. Yeah, that's North Korea.
[3:04:57.080 --> 3:05:00.080]  Ultimate bone broth is back and better than ever.
[3:05:00.080 --> 3:05:05.080]  And 20% off, plus free shipping and double Patriot points for our new sale.
[3:05:05.080 --> 3:05:09.080]  The years of being off the shelves are bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas ever,
[3:05:09.080 --> 3:05:12.080]  and it's now been reformulated as even stronger.
[3:05:12.080 --> 3:05:19.080]  It's ultimate bone broth, plus it's got concentrated high quality chicken broth protein, turmeric root,
[3:05:19.080 --> 3:05:24.080]  that's so amazing, chaga musher, beef pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder,
[3:05:24.080 --> 3:05:27.080]  and it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[3:05:27.080 --> 3:05:34.080]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[3:05:34.080 --> 3:05:36.080]  It tastes better than the last formula.
[3:05:36.080 --> 3:05:38.080]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[3:05:38.080 --> 3:05:45.080]  And again, it has that cutting edge, chicken broth, protein, isolate powder for better flavor and solvability.
[3:05:45.080 --> 3:05:47.080]  You're going to love this.
[3:05:47.080 --> 3:05:51.080]  And what it does for your joints, what it does for your body, what it does for your bones is simply amazing.
[3:05:51.080 --> 3:05:53.080]  And it helps find the info war.
[3:05:53.080 --> 3:05:55.080]  This is really the best bone broth out there.
[3:05:55.080 --> 3:06:05.080]  Here's an M4store.com today.
[3:06:05.080 --> 3:06:13.080]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[3:06:13.080 --> 3:06:15.080]  Roots for America.com, that's his website.
[3:06:15.080 --> 3:06:18.080]  This is the Alex Jones show, fourth hour, Wayne Allen Root.
[3:06:18.080 --> 3:06:23.080]  I won't do his whole background in media or the best selling books he sold or a syndicated radio show.
[3:06:23.080 --> 3:06:30.080]  People can find all that at RootForAmerica.com, Alex Jones, with the attacked and censored info wars.com.
[3:06:30.080 --> 3:06:33.080]  But he just finished an interview with Trump that hasn't even aired yet.
[3:06:33.080 --> 3:06:36.080]  He's got breaking news on that because unlike a lot of other talk shows,
[3:06:36.080 --> 3:06:43.080]  Wayne Allen Root has been holding his feet to the fire in a loving way with his intervention about the poison vaccines and more.
[3:06:43.080 --> 3:06:48.080]  But he's here with a lot of big announcements and information in the fourth hour.
[3:06:48.080 --> 3:06:50.080]  So Wayne Allen Root, thanks for being here.
[3:06:50.080 --> 3:06:52.080]  Hey, Alex, how are you?
[3:06:52.080 --> 3:06:58.080]  Man, it is a crazy world, brother. It's just seeing it all come true. It's just crazy.
[3:06:58.080 --> 3:07:00.080]  A lot of terrible things happening.
[3:07:00.080 --> 3:07:06.080]  But look, I try and stay positive because if you don't try and stay positive, you'll want to kill yourself.
[3:07:06.080 --> 3:07:11.080]  So I think it's important we keep everybody uplifted because we're going to have to fight.
[3:07:11.080 --> 3:07:15.080]  It's going to be a war and we got to stay positive and motivated.
[3:07:15.080 --> 3:07:19.080]  And when elections are rigged, the way the last one was rigged,
[3:07:19.080 --> 3:07:23.080]  I don't know, anyone could have any faith that the next one won't be rigged.
[3:07:23.080 --> 3:07:30.080]  So just winning at the voting booth or the electoral box isn't enough anymore.
[3:07:30.080 --> 3:07:36.080]  You could see the way they're attacking us that, you know, they're coming at us from a thousand directions.
[3:07:36.080 --> 3:07:42.080]  They're all communists. They want to destroy us, censor us, ban us, take us off the air.
[3:07:42.080 --> 3:07:45.080]  It's a communist takeover of the United States.
[3:07:45.080 --> 3:07:51.080]  I call that since January of 2021, the minute Biden put his hand on the Bible and signed in,
[3:07:51.080 --> 3:07:55.080]  I said, is this the start of a communist takeover of the United States?
[3:07:55.080 --> 3:07:59.080]  And by the way, when you're not saying that as words, this is really happening.
[3:07:59.080 --> 3:08:01.080]  I mean, this is really happening.
[3:08:01.080 --> 3:08:07.080]  And by the way, the thing that I bring to the battle, Alex, besides the fact that I grew up in a very rough neighborhood,
[3:08:07.080 --> 3:08:09.080]  you know, I mentioned this on your show before.
[3:08:09.080 --> 3:08:15.080]  I was a little runty Jewish kid in an all Italian rough neighborhood surrounded by an all black town,
[3:08:15.080 --> 3:08:20.080]  went to an all black middle school, all black high school, had a fight, learn how to fight to survive.
[3:08:20.080 --> 3:08:28.080]  And I bring that combattiveness to the conservative fight because we are led by weaklings and cowards,
[3:08:28.080 --> 3:08:35.080]  people like Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy. They're horrible. They don't know how to fight.
[3:08:35.080 --> 3:08:41.080]  So I bring that. And number two, this this kid from from Malvern in New York on the Bronx borderline me,
[3:08:41.080 --> 3:08:47.080]  I managed to graduate valedictorian in my class and get accepted at Columbia University,
[3:08:47.080 --> 3:08:51.080]  where I attended with my classmate, Barack Hussein Obama.
[3:08:51.080 --> 3:09:00.080]  And I bring my understanding of these Ivy League communists who are in charge of America now and what their plan is.
[3:09:00.080 --> 3:09:06.080]  Because I saw it from day one for four years as a college student at Columbia.
[3:09:06.080 --> 3:09:10.080]  I saw it all. I understood what they wanted to do to destroy America.
[3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:16.080]  And mostly it was based on their hatred for white people, even though they were all white.
[3:09:16.080 --> 3:09:20.080]  They were all white liberals who hated white people. They hated their parents.
[3:09:20.080 --> 3:09:24.080]  It's a psychological dysfunction. They're all self hating.
[3:09:24.080 --> 3:09:29.080]  And they've now brought that to government and they're trying to destroy us because they're so embarrassed and guilty
[3:09:29.080 --> 3:09:36.080]  at being born white and rich. Almost everyone I knew at Columbia was filthy rich spoiled brats, unlike me.
[3:09:36.080 --> 3:09:43.080]  And so I had nothing to be guilty about, but they had everything to be guilty about and they're trying to take our country down.
[3:09:43.080 --> 3:09:49.080]  I'm excited to be here and hear what you have to break down because your last big Trump interview was massive.
[3:09:49.080 --> 3:09:53.080]  You actually doing your intervention was a great idea. I picked up everywhere.
[3:09:53.080 --> 3:09:57.080]  What's the big news of the next Trump interview and when's that going to drop?
[3:09:57.080 --> 3:10:04.080]  Well, first of all, it'll air this afternoon. My TV version of it will take 48 hours being edited now, so tomorrow or the day after.
[3:10:04.080 --> 3:10:11.080]  But the radio version is at three o'clock West Coast time, six o'clock East on the Wayne Alleroo show, Ron unfiltered.
[3:10:11.080 --> 3:10:17.080]  USA Radio, you can find it at USARadio.com. USARadio.com.
[3:10:17.080 --> 3:10:21.080]  Well, give us a first look. I'm totally set some important things.
[3:10:21.080 --> 3:10:27.080]  Yeah, I took a few notes, Alex. I jogged a few down. Obviously, we talked about the rigged election.
[3:10:27.080 --> 3:10:32.080]  But I got off that topic really fast because we all know the election was rigged.
[3:10:32.080 --> 3:10:36.080]  And I think people are sick of hearing it. It's totally true.
[3:10:36.080 --> 3:10:42.080]  But people want to hear what are we going to do moving forward? And I said that to President Trump.
[3:10:42.080 --> 3:10:49.080]  Exactly. We know the sky's blue. We know they stole the election. We know you're really still president, but what are we going to do about it?
[3:10:49.080 --> 3:10:54.080]  But we got to move forward. So I also talked about getting rid of Mitch McConnell.
[3:10:54.080 --> 3:10:59.080]  I think that's news. I was bold enough to say that the Canadian truckers are our heroes.
[3:10:59.080 --> 3:11:03.080]  And I asked Trump, I said, you think they're heroes, right? You love them, right? He said, yes.
[3:11:03.080 --> 3:11:09.080]  I said, they have toppled their leader for conservatives in parliament in Canada.
[3:11:09.080 --> 3:11:16.080]  They threw him out because he was too wishy-washy. He was like an American rhino, like Mitt Romney or Mitch McConnell.
[3:11:16.080 --> 3:11:22.080]  We need to throw out Mitch McConnell. Trump, of course, didn't answer, yes, I want to throw out Mitch McConnell.
[3:11:22.080 --> 3:11:30.080]  But he just, I can't even remember the exact way he put it. He made it clear that there's a lot of bad people running the Republican Party.
[3:11:30.080 --> 3:11:36.080]  He wouldn't say out loud, I'm going to throw out Mitch McConnell. And that's not his job, obviously. It's our job.
[3:11:36.080 --> 3:11:44.080]  We got to get rid of Mitch McConnell. We got to convince all the people that get elected in 2022, November,
[3:11:44.080 --> 3:11:52.080]  that every Republican that gets in, when we take over the Senate and the House, we got to overthrow and throw out all the bums who are too weak,
[3:11:52.080 --> 3:11:58.080]  too cowardly, and don't think like you and me and your listeners and my listeners and my viewers and your viewers.
[3:11:58.080 --> 3:12:06.080]  And Donald Trump, I mentioned him being Speaker of the House, which I was the first guy in the country to ever bring that idea up,
[3:12:06.080 --> 3:12:11.080]  that he'd be Speaker of the House. And a lot of people give me credit, all the media, every time they talk about it.
[3:12:11.080 --> 3:12:18.080]  They say, Wayne Root asked him about it. But they say Steve Bannon is the one who first brought it up. Not true.
[3:12:18.080 --> 3:12:28.080]  Steve Bannon brought it up in February of 2021. I wrote about it in my nationally syndicated column in January of 2021.
[3:12:28.080 --> 3:12:38.080]  And I said, Trump should become Speaker of the House and lead and open and lead the investigations, criminal investigations against Biden for everything he's about to do
[3:12:38.080 --> 3:12:44.080]  that we know will destroy this country. And so I asked Trump whether he would be willing to be Speaker of the House.
[3:12:44.080 --> 3:12:54.080]  I put my foot on his neck again and said, will you be willing to be Speaker of the House? And he didn't say no, which is very interesting.
[3:12:54.080 --> 3:13:00.080]  He didn't say no. He said, well, I hope we don't need that. We shouldn't need that. But he wouldn't say no.
[3:13:00.080 --> 3:13:08.080]  That's a really good move because he could easily win a House seat anywhere he wants to do it. And then they would vote him in as a Speaker. That would be amazing.
[3:13:08.080 --> 3:13:19.080]  No, you don't need to win a House seat. Anybody could be Speaker of the House. After we win, after the Republicans control the House, you can name, you can vote in.
[3:13:19.080 --> 3:13:20.080]  First of all, you can nominate.
[3:13:20.080 --> 3:13:26.080]  No, but I knew that too. I read your article back when it came out. But I mean, at the same time, he could just run for the Senator, run for the House.
[3:13:26.080 --> 3:13:33.080]  I know the Senate is different than the House for Speaker, but that would be imagined Senator Trump. That's a great leapfrog back into the White House.
[3:13:33.080 --> 3:13:42.080]  But it's clear to me he doesn't want to do that. So I'd rather make it easy for him now. All you have to do instead of running is be nominated for Speaker of the House.
[3:13:42.080 --> 3:13:45.080]  And if the new House elects you, that's it.
[3:13:45.080 --> 3:13:49.080]  But have they ever had a Speaker of the House that didn't come out of the House?
[3:13:49.080 --> 3:13:58.080]  I don't believe so, but that doesn't mean, hey, did you ever think they'd elect Donald Trump President? Anything can happen in this world if you have enough momentum, anything can happen if you elect enough.
[3:13:58.080 --> 3:14:03.080]  No, I agree. You're about to take over here in a few minutes. But what else did you ask him? I'm intrigued.
[3:14:03.080 --> 3:14:17.080]  I did a big one here. I went out on a limb. I said that a fan of my show is a businessman who imports antigen COVID tests from directly from the manufacturer in China.
[3:14:17.080 --> 3:14:26.080]  So he knows the exact cost of the kits. And he knows what Biden just bought, how many he bought, and the price he paid.
[3:14:26.080 --> 3:14:35.080]  And he said, Wayne, Biden overpaid by eight hundred million dollars. And I said to President Trump, you know a crime is involved.
[3:14:35.080 --> 3:14:41.080]  You know that was a deal. Yeah. So Obama got in trouble for Carlos Slim making money off the Obama phones.
[3:14:41.080 --> 3:14:50.080]  But this is a great way to catch Biden overpaying massively the Chai comms. Probably I bet that same company probably bought some of Hunter's paintings.
[3:14:50.080 --> 3:14:58.080]  Right. So you know that there was a finder's fee of fifty a hundred million dollars involved with that deal. And I said it maybe it wasn't Biden.
[3:14:58.080 --> 3:15:03.080]  Maybe it was Hunter. Maybe it wasn't Hunter. Maybe it was a member of your administration, Mr. Biden.
[3:15:03.080 --> 3:15:08.080]  But we all know somebody took a kickback for it because they can't help themselves.
[3:15:08.080 --> 3:15:13.080]  That's why you do such a great job, Wayne. You're always ferreting this out. You're going to tell us more of what you talked to Trump about straight ahead.
[3:15:13.080 --> 3:15:15.080]  What else are you going to cover?
[3:15:15.080 --> 3:15:26.080]  I'm going to cover what I learned at Columbia, how you overcome the United States, overwhelm the American economy with clowered piven and destroy America once and for all.
[3:15:26.080 --> 3:15:31.080]  I learned it in class at Columbia and it's happening right now in front of our very eyes.
[3:15:31.080 --> 3:15:36.080]  That's right. They admit this is clowered and privy. That's what the great reset is. And on our ashes, they have billed back better.
[3:15:36.080 --> 3:15:41.080]  Wayne Allen Root is on fire, as usual. RootfordAmerica.com. Find out more.
[3:15:41.080 --> 3:15:45.080]  He'll be here in a couple of hours. This is a big Trump interview. He takes over with a balance for the next 45 minutes.
[3:15:45.080 --> 3:15:50.080]  And then Owen Schreuer today on the Attacked, Punished, InfoWars.com.

[3:16:20.080 --> 3:16:25.080]  I must cover a diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun.

[3:16:47.080 --> 3:16:53.080]  Things only get worse from here if we submit. They only get better if we resist and say no.
[3:16:53.080 --> 3:16:56.080]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.

[3:20:15.080 --> 3:20:18.080]  Alright, Wayne Ellingworth, welcome back to the show.
[3:20:18.080 --> 3:20:24.080]  I am hosting guest hosting for this last hour of the Alex Jones Show, hour number four.
[3:20:24.080 --> 3:20:28.080]  Thank you for everything you do, Alex, and thank you for inviting me on the show, it's an honor.
[3:20:28.080 --> 3:20:33.080]  For those of you who don't know me, I'm based out of Las Vegas, Nevada, originally born and raised in New York,
[3:20:33.080 --> 3:20:36.080]  which is one of the biggest fan in the world of Donald Trump.
[3:20:36.080 --> 3:20:43.080]  I'm a proud New York Jewish Republican businessman who produces reality shows
[3:20:43.080 --> 3:20:45.080]  and is married to one of the most gorgeous women in the world.
[3:20:45.080 --> 3:20:48.080]  Sound familiar? Me and Trump are like the same person.
[3:20:48.080 --> 3:20:54.080]  And so I'm a big fan of President Trump, and I just got through interviewing him on my national radio show,
[3:20:54.080 --> 3:21:01.080]  although we did hire a camera crew to come in and tape it as well to turn it into basically a TV interview.
[3:21:01.080 --> 3:21:03.080]  But Trump and I go back a long way.
[3:21:03.080 --> 3:21:08.080]  I was the opening speaker in seven Trump events, seven Trump rallies in Las Vegas,
[3:21:08.080 --> 3:21:13.080]  six of them while he was running for President of the United States in 2015 and 16,
[3:21:13.080 --> 3:21:18.080]  and then one of them is very first rally in Vegas as President of the United States.
[3:21:18.080 --> 3:21:20.080]  I'm very proud that Secret Service called me and said,
[3:21:20.080 --> 3:21:23.080]  you've been chosen to be the opening speaker by President Trump himself.
[3:21:23.080 --> 3:21:26.080]  And we'd like to set up the arrangements.
[3:21:26.080 --> 3:21:28.080]  The advancemen need to call you and arrange it.
[3:21:28.080 --> 3:21:30.080]  And I became the opening speaker for that event as well.
[3:21:30.080 --> 3:21:32.080]  So I go back a ways with Trump.
[3:21:32.080 --> 3:21:37.080]  I just got married in November and we're honeymooning in March at Mar-a-Lago.
[3:21:37.080 --> 3:21:42.080]  And we are just proud as could be to be in President Trump's home for a honeymoon.
[3:21:42.080 --> 3:21:43.080]  Who gets to say that?
[3:21:43.080 --> 3:21:49.080]  So I'm a big fan of President Trump, but I'm also, even though I agree with him on 99% of every issue
[3:21:49.080 --> 3:21:50.080]  and think he was, there's me.
[3:21:50.080 --> 3:21:52.080]  They have me on the screen giving a speech for Trump.
[3:21:52.080 --> 3:21:58.080]  Even though I agree with him on 99% of every issue and everything he ever did,
[3:21:58.080 --> 3:22:01.080]  I disagree with him on one issue, which is vaccines.
[3:22:01.080 --> 3:22:08.080]  And I'm probably the first guy in America along with Alex Jones to just warn people about this issue.
[3:22:08.080 --> 3:22:12.080]  I'm as anti-this COVID vaccine as anyone's ever been.
[3:22:12.080 --> 3:22:15.080]  Let me make sure you understand I'm not anti-vaccine.
[3:22:15.080 --> 3:22:18.080]  As a kid, I had every vaccine, polio, smallpox.
[3:22:18.080 --> 3:22:20.080]  I don't know, name it, whatever you get.
[3:22:20.080 --> 3:22:22.080]  Diptheria, I don't know.
[3:22:22.080 --> 3:22:23.080]  You name it, I had it.
[3:22:23.080 --> 3:22:25.080]  And I'm fine, right?
[3:22:25.080 --> 3:22:26.080]  I lived a wonderful life.
[3:22:26.080 --> 3:22:28.080]  But I'm not anti-vaccine.
[3:22:28.080 --> 3:22:30.080]  I'm anti-this vaccine.
[3:22:30.080 --> 3:22:31.080]  I knew from day one.
[3:22:31.080 --> 3:22:33.080]  Don't ask me why.
[3:22:33.080 --> 3:22:35.080]  I just am a gut instinct guy.
[3:22:35.080 --> 3:22:42.080]  And my gut instinct from day one was while Donald Trump was bragging about it and saying how great it was,
[3:22:42.080 --> 3:22:44.080]  I felt alarm bells were going off.
[3:22:44.080 --> 3:22:49.080]  Being from Vegas, I felt neon signs were blinking in bright red.
[3:22:49.080 --> 3:22:51.080]  Beware, beware.
[3:22:51.080 --> 3:22:53.080]  Don't take this vaccine.
[3:22:53.080 --> 3:22:55.080]  Don't listen to the government.
[3:22:55.080 --> 3:22:57.080]  Government lies about everything.
[3:22:57.080 --> 3:22:59.080]  What did one of my other heroes, Ronald Reagan, say?
[3:22:59.080 --> 3:23:05.080]  The nine worst words in the English language, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[3:23:05.080 --> 3:23:13.080]  And that's what this entire incident of this vaccine, this whole scenario, is like right out of Reagan's saying,
[3:23:13.080 --> 3:23:15.080]  I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[3:23:15.080 --> 3:23:16.080]  Don't ever listen.
[3:23:16.080 --> 3:23:18.080]  Those are the nine worst words.
[3:23:18.080 --> 3:23:19.080]  This was what happened.
[3:23:19.080 --> 3:23:21.080]  Trump trusted government.
[3:23:21.080 --> 3:23:22.080]  He trusted Fauci.
[3:23:22.080 --> 3:23:24.080]  He trusted Berks.
[3:23:24.080 --> 3:23:27.080]  He trusted all the doctors and all the scientists and the CDC.
[3:23:27.080 --> 3:23:30.080]  And that was a giant mistake because they don't have your best interests in mind.
[3:23:30.080 --> 3:23:33.080]  I believe they're all bribed and it was all about money.
[3:23:33.080 --> 3:23:38.080]  Some people say, including Alex, I believe that it's about depopulation and that could very well be.
[3:23:38.080 --> 3:23:41.080]  But I don't get into that because I don't know anything about that.
[3:23:41.080 --> 3:23:45.080]  I'm not around when Bill Gates talks about depopulation or Klaus Schwab.
[3:23:45.080 --> 3:23:46.080]  I'm not there.
[3:23:46.080 --> 3:23:47.080]  So I don't know about that.
[3:23:47.080 --> 3:23:48.080]  I won't discuss that.
[3:23:48.080 --> 3:23:56.080]  I know that this is about money and has been from day one about money and power and also taking the election away from President Trump
[3:23:56.080 --> 3:24:04.080]  to make sure he wasn't reelected and jamming in mail-in ballots by the millions with no voter ID
[3:24:04.080 --> 3:24:06.080]  and ballot harvesting by the millions.
[3:24:06.080 --> 3:24:09.080]  Nobody ever checked the drop boxes and steal the election.
[3:24:09.080 --> 3:24:10.080]  It was all of that.
[3:24:10.080 --> 3:24:14.080]  This is how they rigged and stole the election with COVID.
[3:24:14.080 --> 3:24:22.080]  But more importantly, they all knew they'd get rich off COVID, off the vaccines, off stock in the vaccine manufacturers,
[3:24:22.080 --> 3:24:26.080]  off stock in the big pharma companies, off stock on the masks.
[3:24:26.080 --> 3:24:30.080]  This is how everybody got rich in Washington, D.C.
[3:24:30.080 --> 3:24:32.080]  And President Trump missed that.
[3:24:32.080 --> 3:24:34.080]  That's the first and only thing he's ever missed.
[3:24:34.080 --> 3:24:35.080]  He's brilliant.
[3:24:35.080 --> 3:24:36.080]  He's wonderful.
[3:24:36.080 --> 3:24:37.080]  I want to back as president.
[3:24:37.080 --> 3:24:38.080]  I think he's great.
[3:24:38.080 --> 3:24:41.080]  But he just didn't understand one thing ever.
[3:24:41.080 --> 3:24:43.080]  He's always ahead of the ballgame.
[3:24:43.080 --> 3:24:47.080]  Everyone else is playing chess while he's playing checkers while he's playing chess.
[3:24:47.080 --> 3:24:53.080]  But he missed that everybody was in on the scam, that everybody was going to get rich off the vaccines
[3:24:53.080 --> 3:24:58.080]  if they killed all other options like Hydrax, Chloroquine, and Ivermectin.
[3:24:58.080 --> 3:25:04.080]  Because you can't get FDA's approval for an experimental vaccine for emergency use
[3:25:04.080 --> 3:25:07.080]  if there's any other therapeutic that does the job.
[3:25:07.080 --> 3:25:15.080]  And Hydrax, Chloroquine, and Ivermectin, we now know through literally dozens, if not hundreds of studies all around the world,
[3:25:15.080 --> 3:25:23.080]  they do the job so effectively and so brilliantly, so wonderfully, so magically, so miraculously.
[3:25:23.080 --> 3:25:28.080]  And you add that with vitamin C, in particular intravenous vitamin C.
[3:25:28.080 --> 3:25:30.080]  You add that to vitamin D3.
[3:25:30.080 --> 3:25:32.080]  You add that to zinc.
[3:25:32.080 --> 3:25:34.080]  And you add that to a Z-PAC antibiotic.
[3:25:34.080 --> 3:25:41.080]  And that's the answer for how we did not ever need to have hundreds of thousands of deaths from COVID.
[3:25:41.080 --> 3:25:44.080]  These poor people, these poor people never had to die.
[3:25:44.080 --> 3:25:52.080]  So it really is mass murder because they not only made sure that the vaccines made them billions while the vaccines didn't work
[3:25:52.080 --> 3:26:00.080]  and the vaccines did harm to your immune system, but they also made sure nobody believed in Ivermectin or Hydrax, Chloroquine,
[3:26:00.080 --> 3:26:04.080]  and they made sure nobody could get Hydrax, Chloroquine, or Ivermectin.
[3:26:04.080 --> 3:26:14.080]  They bad-mouted it to the point where doctors would prescribe it for fear of losing their licenses and pharmacies would not fill the prescription,
[3:26:14.080 --> 3:26:20.080]  even if a doctor did prescribe it for fear of losing their license, and therefore hundreds of thousands of people died who never had to die.
[3:26:20.080 --> 3:26:21.080]  Never had to die.
[3:26:21.080 --> 3:26:22.080]  I call that mass murder.
[3:26:22.080 --> 3:26:24.080]  I don't know what other way you could describe it.
[3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:27.080]  Somebody's got to be brought to justice for the mass murder.
[3:26:27.080 --> 3:26:28.080]  But I know one thing.
[3:26:28.080 --> 3:26:34.080]  President Trump had the best interests of America in mind. He thought he was saving millions of lives,
[3:26:34.080 --> 3:26:43.080]  and he thought he was bringing a great drug slash vaccine to market because he heard that from the medical experts who he had to trust and believe
[3:26:43.080 --> 3:26:46.080]  because he knows business better than anyone in the world, but he doesn't know medicine.
[3:26:46.080 --> 3:26:47.080]  He's not a doctor.
[3:26:47.080 --> 3:26:52.080]  So I think, you know, that's the one thing he was ever fooled on, and it's a biggie.
[3:26:52.080 --> 3:26:59.080]  But I got him to admit in my interview today that he's very much against the vaccine mandate, very much against the mandate.
[3:26:59.080 --> 3:27:07.080]  And I told him, I heard an interview where he said, once he's reelected, the very first thing he'll do is finish building the wall.
[3:27:07.080 --> 3:27:14.080]  And I said, you got to promise me you'll do two things at the same time, finish building the wall and kill the vaccine mandate.
[3:27:14.080 --> 3:27:19.080]  And his response was, I will, but it's going to be long gone by that time.
[3:27:19.080 --> 3:27:23.080]  2024 is three years from now. The vaccine mandate will be long gone.
[3:27:23.080 --> 3:27:26.080]  Well, I don't know about that. I don't know if it'll be long gone.
[3:27:26.080 --> 3:27:31.080]  I just want to make sure it's on the forefront of his mind. You've got to kill the vaccine mandate.
[3:27:31.080 --> 3:27:38.080]  Those who want to take it, take it. God bless you. Good luck. You're going to need it because my opinion is you're going to destroy your immune system
[3:27:38.080 --> 3:27:42.080]  and you could wind up dead or or disabled or damaged for the rest of your life.
[3:27:42.080 --> 3:27:47.080]  But if you want to take it, take it, but nobody can be forced to take the vaccine.
[3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:54.080]  So hopefully long before 2024, as Trump said to me in our interview that will air this afternoon.
[3:27:54.080 --> 3:28:03.080]  As I said to Alex, if you want to hear the interview, just go to my radio show either online or or or on your literally on your car phone.

[3:28:54.080 --> 3:28:55.080]  Stay tuned.
[3:28:55.080 --> 3:28:59.080]  Way down the root with all the craziness going on in the world.
[3:28:59.080 --> 3:29:18.080]  With the globalist plotting their next big lockdown for the next phase of the great reset being a stage cyber attack with the deep state pushing a civil war, not just here, but in Europe and war with Russia with the massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place like supply chain right now.

[3:33:13.080 --> 3:33:20.080]  Alright, Wade Root live with you guest hosting for Alex Jones, great, great, great man, and always an honor to be on his show.
[3:33:20.080 --> 3:33:30.080]  Thank you, Alex, for educating the American people and empowering the American people and keeping a lot of people alive and safe at a time where it seems like a lot of people want us dead.
[3:33:30.080 --> 3:33:32.080]  It sure seems like it.
[3:33:32.080 --> 3:33:36.080]  I have some different theories that may be to present you that maybe others don't have.
[3:33:36.080 --> 3:33:46.080]  Let me start with a little self promotion because my latest book is The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book, and you can get it at Amazon or Barnes & Noble.
[3:33:46.080 --> 3:33:51.080]  And it's been a number one book in America several times since it came out in, when did it come out?
[3:33:51.080 --> 3:33:53.080]  I think September last fall.
[3:33:53.080 --> 3:33:59.080]  But the point of the book is it's got a listing in the back.
[3:33:59.080 --> 3:34:08.080]  There's 100 or so companies listed in the back where I give you the names, the phone number, the email address, the social media accounts.
[3:34:08.080 --> 3:34:17.080]  Every single way to contact CEOs of 120 companies that, can I say this on the air, crap on conservatives.
[3:34:17.080 --> 3:34:26.080]  We make them rich and they treat us like garbage and they're rooting America and they're caving to the woke mob and they're treating us like garbage and disregarding what we say.
[3:34:26.080 --> 3:34:28.080]  Well, we buy most of their goods.
[3:34:28.080 --> 3:34:38.080]  So I went out and did a lot of research and hired a team of telemarketers to contact all of them and I got their name, their phone number, their email, every way to contact them that nobody ever had before.
[3:34:38.080 --> 3:34:41.080]  And it's in the book so it's an amazing resource guide.
[3:34:41.080 --> 3:34:44.080]  The reason I bring it up is the Canadian truckers.
[3:34:44.080 --> 3:34:53.080]  My book is, it makes the case that we got a boycott and we got a disrupt and we got a protest and we got a strike against all the powers that be.
[3:34:53.080 --> 3:35:08.080]  We got to act like Dr. Martin Luther King taught the black people of America in the 1960s that we've got to use the power we've got and the money that we spend to destroy all of our enemies before they destroy us.
[3:35:08.080 --> 3:35:12.080]  And it worked fantastically for Martin Luther King and black Americans.
[3:35:12.080 --> 3:35:21.080]  He did a great job and of course he goes down as a legend and a hero and an icon and we have Martin Luther King Day in the United States of America and he gets celebrated right up there with who?
[3:35:21.080 --> 3:35:24.080]  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison.
[3:35:24.080 --> 3:35:25.080]  It's amazing.
[3:35:25.080 --> 3:35:26.080]  He's got his own American holiday.
[3:35:26.080 --> 3:35:27.080]  Well, guess what?
[3:35:27.080 --> 3:35:30.080]  It's time for conservatives to emulate Martin Luther King.
[3:35:30.080 --> 3:35:43.080]  And so the greatest example of what I'm talking about is this Canadian trucker strike or this Canadian trucker boycott or this Canadian trucker convoy and this Canadian trucker blockade.
[3:35:43.080 --> 3:35:51.080]  They are so fantastic and they're inspiring others around the world to do the same.
[3:35:51.080 --> 3:36:02.080]  New Zealand joins Canada and Finland and a trucker convoy in New Zealand blocks parliament and demands an end to vaccines and mask mandates.
[3:36:02.080 --> 3:36:17.080]  That was the whole point of my book, The Great Patriot Protest and boycott book is if you're going to get rid of vaccines and vaccine mandates and mask mandates and lockdowns, we're going to have to take over the country and block the roads and block the roads to Washington D.C.
[3:36:17.080 --> 3:36:20.080]  and the government and block the roads to the Super Bowl.
[3:36:20.080 --> 3:36:22.080]  That's what they should be doing this Sunday.
[3:36:22.080 --> 3:36:27.080]  There should be a trucker convoy that blockades the Super Bowl.
[3:36:27.080 --> 3:36:43.080]  And if they can't or won't do that, and I wrote that column this weekend from my naturally syndicate column, if they can't or won't do what our neighbors are doing in Canada, then what they should do is drive in a convoy of 500,000 American truckers right into Washington D.C.
[3:36:43.080 --> 3:36:46.080]  and surround Washington and lock it down.
[3:36:46.080 --> 3:36:50.080]  If you won't lock down the Super Bowl, which have gotten you the most press in the world.
[3:36:50.080 --> 3:37:01.080]  And I love the Super Bowl, despite the NFL players being morons and social justice fools who don't know what they're doing and supporting communist organizations and spitting in our faces and kneeling for the flag.
[3:37:01.080 --> 3:37:03.080]  I've loved football since I was a little boy.
[3:37:03.080 --> 3:37:06.080]  So I've loved football for 50 years.
[3:37:06.080 --> 3:37:12.080]  And I loved Roger Stalback when I was a kid growing up and that gave me my love of NFL football and the Dallas Cowboys.
[3:37:12.080 --> 3:37:14.080]  And I just can't beat that and I won't stop it.
[3:37:14.080 --> 3:37:20.080]  I love it and I love betting on football and those who don't know I'm one of the biggest betting guys in the world.
[3:37:20.080 --> 3:37:26.080]  The media before I ever got into politics called me the king of Vegas sports gambling and America's odds maker.
[3:37:26.080 --> 3:37:28.080]  That's what I did before I got into politics.
[3:37:28.080 --> 3:37:32.080]  I was the number one odds maker and sports prognosticator in America.
[3:37:32.080 --> 3:37:37.080]  I was the network odds maker for CNBC, then known as financial news network.
[3:37:37.080 --> 3:37:44.080]  And so I give out picks who's going to win against the point spread on American college and pro football games.
[3:37:44.080 --> 3:37:46.080]  And it's a very big business for me.
[3:37:46.080 --> 3:37:50.080]  As a matter of fact, let me mention that website Vegaswinners.com is my website.
[3:37:50.080 --> 3:37:57.080]  I'll have my Super Bowl pick there that literally hundreds or thousands of Americans will click point and click and buy my Super Bowl pick.
[3:37:57.080 --> 3:38:04.080]  It'll be up as of next few days to go there every day and you'll see it may come up on Thursday may come up on Friday.
[3:38:04.080 --> 3:38:07.080]  And well, we know it'll come up on Friday for Sunday's game.
[3:38:07.080 --> 3:38:10.080]  So it may come up early tomorrow or Thursday.
[3:38:10.080 --> 3:38:12.080]  I'm just very close to making that final pick.
[3:38:12.080 --> 3:38:14.080]  It's famous all over the country.
[3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:22.080]  I've won 27 out of 37 soup bowls in my 37 year career as the top sports prognosticator in America and odds maker in America.
[3:38:22.080 --> 3:38:26.080]  Vegaswinners.com is my sports website and that's where my pick will be.
[3:38:26.080 --> 3:38:30.080]  But my point is even though I'm a big better and I love the Super Bowl,
[3:38:30.080 --> 3:38:34.080]  I think that the truckers should blockade the Super Bowl to make a statement.
[3:38:34.080 --> 3:38:38.080]  And I think they should blockade Las Vegas to make a statement just for a few hours.
[3:38:38.080 --> 3:38:40.080]  I don't want to destroy Las Vegas.
[3:38:40.080 --> 3:38:46.080]  I don't want to destroy the Super Bowl, but you'd make a statement if you just did it like all day Saturday before the big game.
[3:38:46.080 --> 3:38:47.080]  Maybe don't do it on Sunday.
[3:38:47.080 --> 3:38:52.080]  Do it on Saturday and make a statement that the national news media has to cover.
[3:38:52.080 --> 3:39:00.080]  But then get in a convoy and go to Washington D.C. and really blockade permanently.
[3:39:00.080 --> 3:39:03.080]  I mean, indefinitely Washington D.C.
[3:39:03.080 --> 3:39:07.080]  You know, every day that Congress is closed, we'll save money.
[3:39:07.080 --> 3:39:09.080]  It's good for the taxpayers.
[3:39:09.080 --> 3:39:14.080]  Every day Congress can't open their mouth and hot air can't come out is money that we've all saved.
[3:39:14.080 --> 3:39:17.080]  So I hope they blockade Washington D.C.
[3:39:17.080 --> 3:39:24.080]  The same way that the Canadian truckers, our brothers up north, have blockaded Ottawa, which is their version of Washington D.C.
[3:39:24.080 --> 3:39:26.080]  It's the capital of Canada, Ottawa.
[3:39:26.080 --> 3:39:27.080]  And they've blockaded it.
[3:39:27.080 --> 3:39:29.080]  There's the photos on the screen.
[3:39:29.080 --> 3:39:36.080]  They are so heroic in what they're doing and it's going to end badly because the police are already arresting truckers.
[3:39:36.080 --> 3:39:38.080]  They're already stealing their gas.
[3:39:38.080 --> 3:39:40.080]  So that's freezing outside tonight.
[3:39:40.080 --> 3:39:46.080]  It's probably 20 below zero and they've got no heat because they have no gas anymore because they took away their gas tanks.
[3:39:46.080 --> 3:39:48.080]  So it's going to end soon.
[3:39:48.080 --> 3:39:52.080]  It can't go on because they freeze to death, I guess.
[3:39:52.080 --> 3:39:54.080]  And there's going to be arrests.
[3:39:54.080 --> 3:39:56.080]  And God forbid there could even be violence.
[3:39:56.080 --> 3:40:01.080]  I pray and hope not because if there is, then there's going to be a revolution in Canada.
[3:40:01.080 --> 3:40:03.080]  And that's what would happen in America.
[3:40:03.080 --> 3:40:12.080]  If you ever touch one of the truckers and hurt them or shoot them, I think you'd literally instigate a revolution in the United States of America.
[3:40:12.080 --> 3:40:14.080]  And that's why we need a trucker convoy.
[3:40:14.080 --> 3:40:22.080]  See, the truckers have so much more power than anybody ever understood out of all the groups in America.
[3:40:22.080 --> 3:40:26.080]  Truckers might have more power than anyone except policemen.
[3:40:26.080 --> 3:40:30.080]  If tomorrow every policeman went on strike, we'd have Mad Max outside.
[3:40:30.080 --> 3:40:32.080]  We'd have the Purge outside.
[3:40:32.080 --> 3:40:40.080]  Everybody would get shot, robbed and killed in the United States of America in a matter of minutes if they heard the police run strike.
[3:40:40.080 --> 3:40:42.080]  So that's how important police are.
[3:40:42.080 --> 3:40:44.080]  Truckers are as important as cops.
[3:40:44.080 --> 3:40:46.080]  And you go, how could that be?
[3:40:46.080 --> 3:40:47.080]  They're just a bunch of truckers.
[3:40:47.080 --> 3:40:48.080]  No, they're not.
[3:40:48.080 --> 3:40:49.080]  They're heroes.
[3:40:49.080 --> 3:41:00.080]  They transport all the goods to the supermarkets and to the restaurants and to the furniture stores and to everything we buy.
[3:41:00.080 --> 3:41:04.080]  If you buy China for your kitchen table, you've got to buy it.
[3:41:04.080 --> 3:41:06.080]  A trucker brought it.
[3:41:06.080 --> 3:41:08.080]  It doesn't matter what you buy.
[3:41:08.080 --> 3:41:11.080]  If you love sports, you buy footballs and baseballs at a sporting goods store.
[3:41:11.080 --> 3:41:12.080]  A trucker brought it.
[3:41:12.080 --> 3:41:20.080]  If you love barbecuing, a trucker brought the meat and a trucker brought the barbecue to Walmart or to Costco before you bought it.
[3:41:20.080 --> 3:41:23.080]  All those stores would be empty without the truckers.
[3:41:23.080 --> 3:41:29.080]  So all you liberal elitist morons out there that think, oh, those truckers are low class.
[3:41:29.080 --> 3:41:30.080]  They're losers.
[3:41:30.080 --> 3:41:31.080]  I don't care about them.
[3:41:31.080 --> 3:41:32.080]  They're unvaccinated.
[3:41:32.080 --> 3:41:33.080]  Arrest them.
[3:41:33.080 --> 3:41:34.080]  Fire them.
[3:41:34.080 --> 3:41:36.080]  You're going to starve to death.
[3:41:36.080 --> 3:41:41.080]  There will be no goods on any shelves in America without the truckers.
[3:41:41.080 --> 3:41:42.080]  You will starve to death.
[3:41:42.080 --> 3:41:49.080]  Every elitist liberals life is in the hands of those dirty unvaccinated truckers.
[3:41:49.080 --> 3:41:53.080]  You realize I'm saying that in quotations, the way a liberal would say it.
[3:41:53.080 --> 3:41:55.080]  I love the truckers.
[3:41:55.080 --> 3:41:57.080]  I call them my mother truckers.
[3:41:57.080 --> 3:42:05.080]  You know, there's nothing greater in this world than a mother trucker who loves Trump and who supports freedom and was against the vaccine mandates.
[3:42:05.080 --> 3:42:06.080]  I love you guys.
[3:42:06.080 --> 3:42:07.080]  You're my heroes.
[3:42:07.080 --> 3:42:12.080]  But liberals think of them as dirty, diseased, low class truckers.
[3:42:12.080 --> 3:42:21.080]  Without those truckers, all of you and all of your children will starve to death and America will cease to exist in a week or less.
[3:42:21.080 --> 3:42:24.080]  And we turn it to Mad Max, even with the police.
[3:42:24.080 --> 3:42:27.080]  So you better love your mother truckers.
[3:42:27.080 --> 3:42:36.080]  And I hope that what they're doing in Canada inspires American truckers to do the same thing except instead of 57,000 18 wheelers.
[3:42:36.080 --> 3:42:50.080]  In America, we'll have a million 18 wheels or 750,000 or a worst case, 500,000 18 wheelers that take over Washington, D.C. and every blue Democrat state capital.
[3:42:50.080 --> 3:42:51.080]  I guess we're on the way out.
[3:42:51.080 --> 3:42:52.080]  What's our timing here?
[3:42:52.080 --> 3:42:53.080]  We on the way.
[3:42:53.080 --> 3:42:55.080]  Oh, all right, we'll see you in a sec.
[3:42:55.080 --> 3:42:56.080]  I'll be right back.
[3:42:56.080 --> 3:42:58.080]  Sold out for months.
[3:42:58.080 --> 3:43:00.080]  X3 is now back in stock.
[3:43:00.080 --> 3:43:08.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[3:43:08.080 --> 3:43:10.080]  It's not the soil anymore.
[3:43:10.080 --> 3:43:12.080]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[3:43:12.080 --> 3:43:21.080]  But when you get high quality tri iodine, all three of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido.
[3:43:21.080 --> 3:43:23.080]  But most importantly, your immune system.
[3:43:23.080 --> 3:43:32.080]  X3, the only tri iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at InfoWarsTour.com.
[3:43:32.080 --> 3:43:40.080]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body, it takes about two weeks to kick in on average, you really need to experience X3.
[3:43:40.080 --> 3:43:43.080]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[3:43:43.080 --> 3:43:48.080]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body.
[3:43:48.080 --> 3:43:53.080]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the InfoWarsTour 360 win.
[3:43:53.080 --> 3:43:57.080]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off at a limited time.
[3:43:57.080 --> 3:44:06.080]  If your ruthless mega corporations have taken over almost every government on earth and who are trying to destroy the middle class in any form of operability,
[3:44:06.080 --> 3:44:10.080]  you've got to divide and conquer the public so they don't know they're being targeted.
[3:44:10.080 --> 3:44:19.080]  And that's why the Fortune 100 have wrapped themselves, the name of LBGT and African American rights, all the rest of it, all over the world.
[3:44:19.080 --> 3:44:25.080]  That's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in Africa and in communist China and many other areas,
[3:44:25.080 --> 3:44:31.080]  while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through the big tech and the central banks and other zone.
[3:44:31.080 --> 3:44:33.080]  So this is a criminal takeover.
[3:44:33.080 --> 3:44:41.080]  And when you look at the new superclass, it's the politicians, it's the corporate media, it's the police, it's the bureaucrats,
[3:44:41.080 --> 3:44:45.080]  it's members of Congress and their staff and their families, it's the White House,
[3:44:45.080 --> 3:44:54.080]  hell, it's postal workers who were all exempt from the poison shots, but not the general public and everybody else through corporate rule.
[3:44:54.080 --> 3:44:57.080]  So this is the true discrimination that's going on.
[3:44:57.080 --> 3:45:01.080]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock.
[3:45:01.080 --> 3:45:09.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[3:45:09.080 --> 3:45:18.080]  It's not the soil anymore, most of the ocean is contaminated, but when you get high quality triiodine, all three of the healthy types together,
[3:45:18.080 --> 3:45:23.080]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly your immune system.
[3:45:23.080 --> 3:45:33.080]  So X3, the only triiodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at infowarstore.com.

[3:45:39.080 --> 3:45:41.080]  you really need to experience X3.

[3:45:58.080 --> 3:46:02.080]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome.
[3:46:02.080 --> 3:46:03.080]  Hello, Alex.
[3:46:03.080 --> 3:46:04.080]  Yes, Malcolm.
[3:46:04.080 --> 3:46:07.080]  Alright, I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[3:46:07.080 --> 3:46:12.080]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer.
[3:46:12.080 --> 3:46:18.080]  Supermail volatility and brain force plus. Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[3:46:18.080 --> 3:46:20.080]  Supermail volatility really, really works.
[3:46:20.080 --> 3:46:25.080]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up,
[3:46:25.080 --> 3:46:29.080]  and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[3:46:29.080 --> 3:46:32.080]  They also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[3:46:32.080 --> 3:46:36.080]  This is like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch is different.
[3:46:36.080 --> 3:46:38.080]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[3:46:38.080 --> 3:46:41.080]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[3:46:41.080 --> 3:46:43.080]  That's just how it is. It's how it works.
[3:46:43.080 --> 3:46:48.080]  So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[3:46:48.080 --> 3:47:15.080]  If you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[3:47:15.080 --> 3:47:18.080]  All right, Wayne Alleroo back for my last segment.
[3:47:18.080 --> 3:47:21.080]  It always goes so fast on Alex Jones' show.
[3:47:21.080 --> 3:47:24.080]  For me, Wayne Alleroo is guest host. It's ridiculous.
[3:47:24.080 --> 3:47:30.080]  This is, I think, the fourth time that I've either guest hosted or been on for an hour with Alex.
[3:47:30.080 --> 3:47:35.080]  And each time I threatened that I was going to talk about Cloward Piven at Columbia University
[3:47:35.080 --> 3:47:41.080]  and I ran out of time and never discussed it, it's going to take a whole hour for me to go through Cloward Piven.
[3:47:41.080 --> 3:47:46.080]  So that should inspire all my friends and Alex Jones to get Wayne Alleroo back for an hour
[3:47:46.080 --> 3:47:51.080]  just to go over Cloward Piven that I learned at Columbia alongside my classmate,
[3:47:51.080 --> 3:47:57.080]  that communist son of a, you know what, Barack Obama, who I think was sent to destroy this country
[3:47:57.080 --> 3:48:03.080]  and did it very slowly and very gradually when he was president for eight years
[3:48:03.080 --> 3:48:08.080]  because he didn't want to be known as the guy who totally tipped over the economy and destroyed America.
[3:48:08.080 --> 3:48:11.080]  But now it's his third term. Obama's the president.
[3:48:11.080 --> 3:48:13.080]  Biden is not the president in case you don't know that.
[3:48:13.080 --> 3:48:19.080]  Biden is a brain dead puppet who doesn't know what day it is, what his name is, who his wife is.
[3:48:19.080 --> 3:48:26.080]  Jill probably changes his diapers in the White House basement and feeds him baby food and puts him to bed and gives him his blanky.
[3:48:26.080 --> 3:48:28.080]  Biden doesn't know who the hell he is or where he is.
[3:48:28.080 --> 3:48:32.080]  Obama is the president as sure as I'm standing here.
[3:48:32.080 --> 3:48:35.080]  Obama is using Biden as the front guy.
[3:48:35.080 --> 3:48:40.080]  Obama is the ventriloquist and Biden is the dummy and Biden moves his mouth
[3:48:40.080 --> 3:48:44.080]  and Obama's ideas come out of his mouth. That's the way it works, right?
[3:48:44.080 --> 3:48:49.080]  Move the mouth for the dummy and Obama's the one is the ventriloquist in the background.
[3:48:49.080 --> 3:48:52.080]  This is the third term. Make no mistake about it.
[3:48:52.080 --> 3:48:58.080]  Third term of Barack Hussein Obama and this time he can act as radical as he wants
[3:48:58.080 --> 3:49:04.080]  and destroy America quickly because A, he's got a front dummy, Biden, who will take all the blame.
[3:49:04.080 --> 3:49:09.080]  So Obama won't go down in history as the first and only black president who also destroyed America.
[3:49:09.080 --> 3:49:11.080]  He's very careful about his image.
[3:49:11.080 --> 3:49:16.080]  Biden will go down in history as an old white man who destroyed America.
[3:49:16.080 --> 3:49:22.080]  So it won't be the fault of Obama and B, he now knows Obama that you may get Trump again.
[3:49:22.080 --> 3:49:24.080]  So he's got to act fast.
[3:49:24.080 --> 3:49:30.080]  You know, I'm thrilled at the idea of Trump being president again in 2024, elected in 2025, taking over.
[3:49:30.080 --> 3:49:34.080]  But is America going to even exist by 2025?
[3:49:34.080 --> 3:49:36.080]  That's a very fair question.
[3:49:36.080 --> 3:49:40.080]  You know, America will exist, but will it exist as a communist nation?
[3:49:40.080 --> 3:49:46.080]  Will we all be banned and terminated and imprisoned and in reeducation camp
[3:49:46.080 --> 3:49:51.080]  and our guns taken away and the borders open so instead of 330 million Americans,
[3:49:51.080 --> 3:49:57.080]  there's 530 million Americans and 200 million new foreigners from all over the world
[3:49:57.080 --> 3:50:01.080]  that will swamp us and destroy us. These are all fair questions.
[3:50:01.080 --> 3:50:05.080]  I don't know if we're going to be around by 2024 for Trump to get reelected
[3:50:05.080 --> 3:50:08.080]  or 2025 for Trump to be sworn in and serve.
[3:50:08.080 --> 3:50:10.080]  That's why Obama is moving quickly now.
[3:50:10.080 --> 3:50:13.080]  Let me mention again, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[3:50:13.080 --> 3:50:16.080]  It's my new book, my latest book.
[3:50:16.080 --> 3:50:20.080]  I've got another one coming out soon, The Great Patriot Buycott Book, but that's not out yet.
[3:50:20.080 --> 3:50:26.080]  That'll be the list of the 100 plus best corporations in America that conservatives should buy from
[3:50:26.080 --> 3:50:29.080]  because they love us and they're on our side and they're patriots.
[3:50:29.080 --> 3:50:34.080]  But this is The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book and these are the companies that are against us
[3:50:34.080 --> 3:50:39.080]  and I make it easy for you to call them and attack them just like the Canadian blockade
[3:50:39.080 --> 3:50:44.080]  and the Canadian trucker convoy, my mother truckers, they're using my philosophy
[3:50:44.080 --> 3:50:50.080]  of Dr. Martin Luther King, which is civil disobedience and strikes and boycotts and intimidation.
[3:50:50.080 --> 3:50:56.080]  That's what they're doing. Blockades can win us the battle to end the vaccine mandates
[3:50:56.080 --> 3:51:02.080]  and the mask mandates and the lockdowns and everything else these crazy people are trying.
[3:51:02.080 --> 3:51:08.080]  Let me read you just a couple things that came out in the last week that I wrote about in my most recent column
[3:51:08.080 --> 3:51:15.080]  that prove in my opinion that the vaccine is a disaster and a fraud and the biggest scam in world history
[3:51:15.080 --> 3:51:21.080]  and really just a money making opportunity for Dr. Fauci and Big Pharma to all become billionaires.
[3:51:21.080 --> 3:51:25.080]  It's a get rich quick scheme. That's what this is.
[3:51:25.080 --> 3:51:29.080]  Is there depopulation involved? People like Gates and Klaus Schwab.
[3:51:29.080 --> 3:51:35.080]  Undoubtedly, I'm sure that some of that involved some of the crazy people at the top may believe in things like that
[3:51:35.080 --> 3:51:38.080]  but I wasn't there when the plan was hatched. I don't know.
[3:51:38.080 --> 3:51:42.080]  What I know is it's a get rich quick scheme.
[3:51:42.080 --> 3:51:49.080]  First of all, it's worthless. More Israelis have been vaccinated percentage wise than pretty much any nation on the planet Earth.
[3:51:49.080 --> 3:51:54.080]  Israel brought into this thing gigantic. This is science, folks. Nothing about this that's misleading.
[3:51:54.080 --> 3:52:00.080]  This is the very definition of science. Facts. Looking at facts.
[3:52:00.080 --> 3:52:06.080]  Israel was the first nation in the world to jab all its citizens and they're the most jabbed nation in the world
[3:52:06.080 --> 3:52:14.080]  and at this point Israel has jabbed one jab, two jabs, three jabs, four jabs and headed for number five, the second booster.
[3:52:14.080 --> 3:52:20.080]  And right now at this moment Israel has more people sick per capita than any other nation in the world.
[3:52:20.080 --> 3:52:27.080]  More people are sick with COVID in Israel than any nation in the world per capita.
[3:52:27.080 --> 3:52:30.080]  How do you explain that if the vaccine works?
[3:52:30.080 --> 3:52:39.080]  How do you explain that about a little bit more than one half of 1% of everyone in Israel is getting sick with COVID every day?
[3:52:39.080 --> 3:52:47.080]  One half of 1% of the entire population of Israel, you heard me right, gets sick every day with COVID
[3:52:47.080 --> 3:52:55.080]  and at this moment in time more people are sick with COVID than at the height of spring 2020 when COVID first came out
[3:52:55.080 --> 3:52:59.080]  and there was no vaccine. How do you explain that?
[3:52:59.080 --> 3:53:08.080]  But the way that I think Dr. Fauci would explain it is he'd say, well Wayne, okay, we said you couldn't get COVID if you got the vaccine
[3:53:08.080 --> 3:53:15.080]  and that was wrong and we said you wouldn't have to wear a mask anymore if you got the vaccine and that was wrong, right?
[3:53:15.080 --> 3:53:19.080]  And we said you couldn't spread COVID if you got the vaccine and that's wrong.
[3:53:19.080 --> 3:53:25.080]  But I will tell you what's right. At least you don't get severe illness with the COVID vaccine.
[3:53:25.080 --> 3:53:30.080]  You will not get bad COVID. You will not be hospitalized. You will not die. We're preventing that.
[3:53:30.080 --> 3:53:37.080]  Well, Dr. Fauci, you're a liar and a fraud and Ergo, you're a mass murderer because you've lied about everything.
[3:53:37.080 --> 3:53:40.080]  It's all a scam. It's a get rich quick scheme.
[3:53:40.080 --> 3:53:43.080]  And so Israel leads the world in COVID death.
[3:53:43.080 --> 3:53:50.080]  Yes, the most vaccinated nation in the world leads the world in COVID death rate per capita.
[3:53:50.080 --> 3:53:55.080]  Again, Israel much smaller country than America or China or Russia or Mexico or India.
[3:53:55.080 --> 3:54:06.080]  But based on its size per capita, more people are dying in Israel than India or China or America or Russia or UK or any other nation in the world.
[3:54:06.080 --> 3:54:13.080]  So if they're the most vaccinated nation in the world and they have the most people with COVID in the world and they have the most people hospitalized in the world
[3:54:13.080 --> 3:54:20.080]  and the 80 percent of the hospitalized are vaccinated by the way in Israel and they have the most people dead in the world.
[3:54:20.080 --> 3:54:22.080]  What exactly is the vaccine accomplished?
[3:54:22.080 --> 3:54:27.080]  And do germs change when they fly over a border?
[3:54:27.080 --> 3:54:38.080]  So if I have stats from every country in the world, UK, Scotland, Germany, Spain, Israel, they all show the same thing.
[3:54:38.080 --> 3:54:44.080]  Almost everybody sick is vaccinated with COVID. Almost everybody hospitalized with COVID is vaccinated.
[3:54:44.080 --> 3:54:47.080]  Almost everybody who's dying of COVID is vaccinated.
[3:54:47.080 --> 3:54:54.080]  If that's the case, how come in America they keep claiming that it's all unvaccinated people in the hospital?
[3:54:54.080 --> 3:55:00.080]  And the answer is they changed the definition in America of what vaccinated means.
[3:55:00.080 --> 3:55:05.080]  Are you aware of this? Put me back on the screen, boys and girls, at Alex Jones.
[3:55:05.080 --> 3:55:11.080]  I want people to look in my eyes as I explain this story to them. So get me back up there. There we go.
[3:55:11.080 --> 3:55:21.080]  So here's the definition in America as determined by Fauci and the CDC of what unvaccinated means.
[3:55:21.080 --> 3:55:28.080]  They know that the very moment you get the vaccine for the next 14 days is when it's the death period.
[3:55:28.080 --> 3:55:35.080]  You're either going to get COVID and die or get COVID and be seriously ill, or you're going to die from the vaccine,
[3:55:35.080 --> 3:55:41.080]  or you're going to get very ill from the vaccine during a 14-day period right after you get vaccinated.
[3:55:41.080 --> 3:55:44.080]  So guess what their definition of vaccinated versus unvaccinated is?
[3:55:44.080 --> 3:55:50.080]  For 14 days after you get the second vaccine, you count as unvaccinated.
[3:55:50.080 --> 3:55:55.080]  That's how they're able to say everybody dying, everybody sick is unvaccinated.
[3:55:55.080 --> 3:55:58.080]  Well, in Israel, they're all vaccinated and they're sick and they're dying.
[3:55:58.080 --> 3:56:00.080]  And in Germany, they're vaccinated and they're sick and they're dying.
[3:56:00.080 --> 3:56:03.080]  And in England, they're vaccinated and they're sick and they're dying.
[3:56:03.080 --> 3:56:06.080]  How do you explain only in America does the germ act differently?
[3:56:06.080 --> 3:56:13.080]  Because the definition is for a month after your first vaccine, you count as unvaccinated.
[3:56:13.080 --> 3:56:16.080]  And if you died during that month, you died unvaccinated.
[3:56:16.080 --> 3:56:19.080]  If you're hospitalized, you're hospitalized unvaccinated.
[3:56:19.080 --> 3:56:24.080]  If you get COVID, even if it's mild, they say you were unvaccinated when you got COVID.
[3:56:24.080 --> 3:56:28.080]  Then after the second vaccine, 14-day window where you're unvaccinated.
[3:56:28.080 --> 3:56:34.080]  And then I'm guessing after the booster, the third shot, it's another 14 days where they count you as unvaccinated.
[3:56:34.080 --> 3:56:36.080]  That's what I've been guessing.
[3:56:36.080 --> 3:56:39.080]  And I think I guessed right because guess what?
[3:56:39.080 --> 3:56:43.080]  In other countries around the world, I just found out that's exactly what they do.
[3:56:43.080 --> 3:56:49.080]  In Canada, in Germany, in Israel, even after the booster, you count as unvaccinated.
[3:56:49.080 --> 3:56:54.080]  So if you die after the first shot for a month, if you die after the second shot for two weeks,
[3:56:54.080 --> 3:56:59.080]  and if you die after the booster for two weeks, at those very moments where they know the die-off will happen,
[3:56:59.080 --> 3:57:05.080]  they count you as unvaccinated, which is how this is a pandemic of the vaccinated death.
[3:57:05.080 --> 3:57:11.080]  But they're calling it a pandemic of the unvaccinated because they count all of the vaccinated people as unvaccinated.
[3:57:11.080 --> 3:57:16.080]  That's the scam. Everybody's getting rich, but you and me, everybody's getting sick.
[3:57:16.080 --> 3:57:20.080]  Thank God, hopefully not you and me because we understand the scam.
[3:57:20.080 --> 3:57:22.080]  I hear in my ear, my time is up.
[3:57:22.080 --> 3:57:28.080]  Please get me back quickly because I wanted to take a whole hour and tell you about clowered piven
[3:57:28.080 --> 3:57:32.080]  and how what I learned at Columbia is exactly what's happening in America today.
[3:57:32.080 --> 3:57:35.080]  It's a communist takeover of the United States.
[3:57:35.080 --> 3:57:37.080]  It's a takedown of the American economy.
[3:57:37.080 --> 3:57:39.080]  It's a destruction of capitalism.
[3:57:39.080 --> 3:57:46.080]  Wayne Allen Root, RootFromAmerican.com, and VegasWinners.com. God bless you.
[3:58:09.080 --> 3:58:13.080]  This flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[3:58:13.080 --> 3:58:19.080]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[3:58:19.080 --> 3:58:24.080]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[3:58:24.080 --> 3:58:29.080]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role
[3:58:29.080 --> 3:58:33.080]  in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[3:58:33.080 --> 3:58:37.080]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate.
[3:58:37.080 --> 3:58:40.080]  It's an affluent population like here in America.
[3:58:40.080 --> 3:58:46.080]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at importstore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[3:58:50.080 --> 3:58:54.080]  Granny Do Right. Granny Do Right. Thanks for holding her on the ear. Go ahead.
[3:58:54.080 --> 3:58:57.080]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products.
[3:58:57.080 --> 3:59:04.080]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[3:59:04.080 --> 3:59:08.080]  loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[3:59:08.080 --> 3:59:14.080]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[3:59:14.080 --> 3:59:20.080]  People think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought,
[3:59:20.080 --> 3:59:25.080]  you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[3:59:25.080 --> 3:59:30.080]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time,
[3:59:30.080 --> 3:59:35.080]  I started noticing, okay, you know, this is the ticket. This is working. This is wonderful.
[3:59:35.080 --> 3:59:40.080]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[3:59:40.080 --> 4:00:04.080]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
