[00:00:14.953 --> 00:00:26.355]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this very special Thursday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:31.536]  There have been some massive developments that have taken place since the Davos Group began its meeting.
[00:00:32.478 --> 00:00:33.878]  in the last week.
[00:00:33.878 --> 00:00:35.799]  Again, this is the public arm of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:42.520]  This is the top of the corporate world government that is establishing this entire eugenics biomedical state.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:53.523]  They have now signaled that they're shifting away from the forced inoculations and the lockdowns, for now, into carbon taxes and carbon lockdowns.
[00:00:53.523 --> 00:00:58.924]  Now, Schwab and others said five years ago that this would be their plan once they'd done the biomedical scare.
[00:00:59.804 --> 00:01:05.487]  They would then move directly to the carbon tax, climate crisis, we're all dead by the year 2030.
[00:01:05.487 --> 00:01:15.974]  And then as they orchestrate the cutting off of food and resources in the years leading up to 2030, they then blame the collapse again on us and climate.
[00:01:15.974 --> 00:01:17.334]  And of course, it's nonsensical.
[00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:18.955]  None of it's meant to make sense.
[00:01:18.955 --> 00:01:20.836]  They tell you you deserve to die.
[00:01:20.836 --> 00:01:24.459]  They create a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.160]  And then they launch.
[00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:28.026]  We're good.
[00:01:44.418 --> 00:01:54.482]  I shot a very important special report last night dealing with 5G and how it's causing major airlines to stop their flights in the United States.
[00:01:54.482 --> 00:01:56.303]  It's very, very revealing.
[00:01:56.303 --> 00:01:56.843]  U.S.
[00:01:56.843 --> 00:02:04.747]  5G is twice as strong as European 5G, extremely toxic, but also completely destroys the signals that aircraft get.
[00:02:05.547 --> 00:02:25.422]  That very important report is coming up next segment and so much more today but this is a big victory that they're having to on the surface say that they're stopping the lockdowns and the vax passes for now in areas like the UK because they know that it's built a crescendo of political resistance and awakening that if they keep pushing
[00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:30.492]  Would cause a catalyst and a major political realignment that would defeat them.
[00:02:30.492 --> 00:02:37.698]  They had the liberals and the conservatives ready with a super majority in parliament in the UK to override the prime minister and stop the lockdowns.
[00:02:37.698 --> 00:02:42.101]  Now he'll come back with lockdowns later, but the point is people are now onto them.
[00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:50.448]  Finally, I want to play a clip of Joe Biden and his disastrous press conference yesterday saying that, Oh, he thinks that the upcoming election in 290 days is going to be.
[00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.231]  Disputed.
[00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:55.251]  It's going to have problems.
[00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:56.412]  It's going to be illegitimate.
[00:02:56.412 --> 00:02:58.854]  Remember, no conservative is allowed to say that.
[00:02:58.854 --> 00:03:02.277]  Only Democrats can warn of election theft.
[00:03:02.277 --> 00:03:04.699]  Only Democrats can control the counting of the vote.
[00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:09.743]  Just as Stalin said, he doesn't care who cast the vote, but he cares who counts them.
[00:03:09.743 --> 00:03:11.284]  Harrison Smith will also be taking over.
[00:03:11.284 --> 00:03:13.967]  A lot of breaking news in the interim today.
[00:03:13.967 --> 00:03:16.709]  But here is the clip of Joe Biden.
[00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.032]  And we'll be back on the other side with this very important 5G report.
[00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:22.393]  And remember, the only way this broadcast gets out.
[00:03:23.274 --> 00:03:35.258]  The only way people hear the truth, the only way we bypass big tech in the new world order is when you share the live links from freeworldnews.tv and infowars.com forward slash show and futurenews.news.
[00:03:35.258 --> 00:03:36.979]  Here is Joe Biden, the puppet collapsing.
[00:03:41.417 --> 00:03:52.884]  A moment ago, you were asked whether or not you believed that we would have free and fair elections in 2022 if some of these state legislatures reforms their voting protocols.
[00:03:52.884 --> 00:03:55.605]  You said that it depends.
[00:03:55.605 --> 00:04:00.708]  Do you do you think that they would in any way be illegitimate?
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.783]  Oh yeah, I think it's easy for me to be illegitimate.
[00:04:04.783 --> 00:04:12.690]  Imagine, imagine if, in fact, Trump has succeeded in convincing Pence to not count the votes.
[00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.734]  Imagine if... In regards to 2022, sir, the midterm election.
[00:04:16.734 --> 00:04:24.561]  Oh, 2022, I mean, imagine if those attempts to say that the count was not legit.
[00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.660]  Yes, sir.
[00:04:40.327 --> 00:04:42.049]  These reforms passed.
[00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:54.343]  But I don't think you're going to see, you're not going to see me, and I don't think you're going to see the Democratic Party give up on coming back at assuming that the attempt fails today.
[00:04:54.343 --> 00:04:56.206]  One more, sir.
[00:04:56.206 --> 00:05:00.310]  You know, you campaigned and you ran on a return to civility.
[00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:07.974]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:13.836]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[00:05:13.836 --> 00:05:20.198]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[00:05:20.518 --> 00:05:27.745]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[00:05:27.745 --> 00:05:38.034]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[00:05:38.454 --> 00:05:47.464]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[00:05:47.464 --> 00:05:54.051]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[00:05:54.051 --> 00:06:00.238]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:14.893]  Dozens of major world airline carriers have stopped flights to the United States over one big thing, 5G, and the fact that it totally jams all their communications.
[00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:27.025]  Lufthansa became one of at least nine airlines cancelling flights or changing jets over fears the 5G network could interfere with the plane's technology.
[00:06:27.025 --> 00:06:35.770]  They're warning that sensitive flight instruments like autopilot and terrain warning may be compromised in low visibility conditions which we've seen in the Northeast this week.
[00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:44.274]  Including the possibility of catastrophic failures leading to multiple fatalities in the absence of appropriate mitigations.
[00:06:49.738 --> 00:06:49.998]  We're good
[00:07:08.575 --> 00:07:09.015]  That's right.
[00:07:35.754 --> 00:07:35.954]  Is it?
[00:07:56.596 --> 00:08:08.225]  Well, it's because they already know in other parts of the world where 5G has gone in, it wreaks total havoc on the instrumentation of the aircraft again because it's so incredibly powerful.
[00:08:08.225 --> 00:08:13.029]  It blocks and jams many of their systems like altimeters.
[00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:14.670]  Now think about that.
[00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:22.356]  Whether you think cancer is a good thing, whether you think the world's overpopulated and you believe it's a good thing, it's going to kill everybody, or maybe you think it's good for you, it's wonderful.
[00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.031]  And has no health effects, despite all the facts.
[00:08:27.031 --> 00:08:39.573]  Why would the establishment worldwide roll this out and not go out and research and check that it jams all sorts of other communications?
[00:08:39.573 --> 00:08:45.014]  Blinds the different instruments in the cockpit of aircraft.
[00:08:45.014 --> 00:08:52.436]  Why wouldn't the corporate system go out and do studies or look at what the effects of this would be once they turned it on?
[00:08:53.763 --> 00:09:02.725]  Well the answer is they just don't care because they want autonomous cars and autonomous robots on the streets and that's what 5G is for overall.
[00:09:02.725 --> 00:09:12.467]  Because you can't have latent systems have a big space of time or have to buffer when it's a robot car or a robot truck or robot drone or robot aircraft.
[00:09:12.467 --> 00:09:16.587]  You've got to have continual connection to that.
[00:09:16.587 --> 00:09:18.788]  And that's why they want 5G in place.
[00:09:19.813 --> 00:09:22.355]  And the political system doesn't care about the health risks.
[00:09:22.355 --> 00:09:27.919]  They don't care about the facts that this stuff is worse statistically than smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for 40 years.
[00:09:27.919 --> 00:09:35.585]  They care about having this control system in so they can roll out the new robot economy that Klaus Schwab talks about so much.
[00:09:35.585 --> 00:09:44.873]  But there is a major historical parallel to what we've seen with 5G rollout and all the evidence and all the facts and all the dangers being ignored by the establishment.
[00:09:45.598 --> 00:09:54.541]  And that's the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion that happened more than a decade ago on April 20th, 2010.
[00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:57.402]  And what happened then?
[00:09:57.402 --> 00:09:58.022]  It's on record.
[00:09:58.022 --> 00:10:10.626]  In fact, if you've seen the movie with Kurt Russell and with others, it's extremely accurate because they used the lawsuit court proceedings and witness files to basically write the script.
[00:10:10.626 --> 00:10:14.807]  And I've gone and read much of the file and much of the testimony from Deepwater Horizon
[00:10:16.024 --> 00:10:36.043]  And there were bankers back in London who ordered the bankers in Houston to order the engineers on, at that time, the deepest well ever drilled in world history, to not dump what they call mud in on top of the drill as it went deeper.
[00:10:37.537 --> 00:10:39.458]  Now, mud is really just concrete.
[00:10:39.458 --> 00:10:55.268]  That's why on a big rig like that, while it's drilling, you'll see ships just lined up for miles and miles, big tankers, and they've got concrete being mixed inside of them that has been pumped into the well and pumped down the hole, and it was costing them more than $25 million a day in mud.
[00:10:55.268 --> 00:11:04.875]  And so the executives looked at that, this is all on record, they have the emails, they have the text messages, they have the testimony, and off in London, they ordered Houston to order the rig,
[00:11:06.004 --> 00:11:06.805]  to not dump mud.
[00:11:06.805 --> 00:11:11.087]  They said, you know, dump seawater into the hole.
[00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:17.071]  And the engineers went, whoa, that'll cause it to mix with the gas and oil and cause a blowout, guaranteed.
[00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:21.573]  And because there's not enough pressure in it, at first the water pressure will keep it down, but it'll only build.
[00:11:21.573 --> 00:11:26.536]  And once it explodes, it'll probably kill everybody on the rig and cause the biggest oil spill in history.
[00:11:26.536 --> 00:11:31.059]  And on record, the execs ordered them to do it.
[00:11:31.059 --> 00:11:33.561]  And so the engineers didn't want to lose their jobs.
[00:11:34.448 --> 00:11:36.550]  They should have just said, I'm not doing it.
[00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.353]  And they said, okay, we want the head executive in the U.S.
[00:11:39.353 --> 00:11:40.614]  here on the ship.
[00:11:40.614 --> 00:11:45.479]  So he got on a jet and they got on a helicopter and flew out there and they did the test.
[00:11:45.479 --> 00:11:48.662]  And they stopped dumping the concrete in.
[00:11:48.662 --> 00:11:50.363]  And at first it didn't blow up.
[00:11:50.363 --> 00:11:52.505]  And he said, see, told you, bye, flew off.
[00:11:53.168 --> 00:11:57.191]  And a few hours later, in the middle of the night, it blew sky high.
[00:11:57.191 --> 00:11:58.552]  And the rest is history.
[00:11:58.552 --> 00:12:08.959]  And that's a perfect example of 5G, or these mRNA vaccines, or all of these corporate revolutions, where these corporate heads don't feel like they're ever going to be held accountable.
[00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:12.602]  Okay, they caused $100 billion in damages, they pay a $2 billion fine.
[00:12:12.602 --> 00:12:16.585]  Or they put out a deadly vaccine that causes a bunch of death, they'll just have the regulators they own cover it up.
[00:12:17.577 --> 00:12:17.837]  And that's
[00:12:42.248 --> 00:12:56.911]  Ships that flew in the air had a big energy source that fired a light into the air, and that out of that energy source, all the machines, including what he described as basically big, tall Autobot-type Transformers walking around that humans controlled.
[00:12:56.911 --> 00:13:05.513]  And he said 2,000 plus years ago this was happening, and that the energy source got unstable because they wanted too much power from it, and it blew up.
[00:13:05.513 --> 00:13:07.334]  Now, I don't know if Atlantis really existed.
[00:13:08.271 --> 00:13:15.599]  But we've built Atlantis-type technology now, and we've got a bunch of corporate chiefs and people that feel totally disconnected from reality.
[00:13:15.599 --> 00:13:17.822]  They're creating animal-human clones.
[00:13:17.822 --> 00:13:19.784]  They are releasing GMO all over the planet.
[00:13:19.784 --> 00:13:21.085]  They're releasing smart dust.
[00:13:21.085 --> 00:13:22.587]  They created COVID-19 in Wuhan.
[00:13:22.587 --> 00:13:24.249]  That's in all the documents.
[00:13:24.249 --> 00:13:29.214]  And the public is living here in this super scientific advanced civilization, but we're losing
[00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:30.470]  I think?
[00:13:49.144 --> 00:13:49.785]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:14:04.464 --> 00:14:06.466]  They want to get rid of the general public.
[00:14:06.466 --> 00:14:08.689]  And that's why they're so reckless and so crazy.
[00:14:08.689 --> 00:14:19.099]  But it's clear from their activities that wanting depopulation, wanting to build a dystopia is really because they don't have the mind or the skills to hold humanity up and actually go the future we don't show ourselves.
[00:14:19.099 --> 00:14:25.986]  So they've just rationalized that they're having a controlled demolition of the economy through globalism because that's a better plan.
[00:14:25.986 --> 00:14:27.848]  And the truth is they're scared and don't know what to do.
[00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:42.904]  There's also a healthy mix of powerful corporate executives who, again, think they know better than engineers about simple mathematics of the fact that a deepwater well is going to blow up when it hits major gas and oil reserves.
[00:14:42.904 --> 00:14:45.666]  So this is a cautionary parable.
[00:14:46.687 --> 00:14:56.109]  That's real life for everybody to wake up and look around us and realize that everything these big corporations roll out is not always a good idea.
[00:14:56.109 --> 00:14:58.409]  And generally, it's a very bad idea.
[00:14:58.409 --> 00:15:05.191]  And they're like mad scientists that actually don't know what they're doing, but are just playing around with the very laws of nature and physics.
[00:15:05.191 --> 00:15:05.451]  All right.
[00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:07.111]  Thank you for joining us here today.
[00:15:07.111 --> 00:15:07.691]  We'll continue.
[00:15:07.691 --> 00:15:08.991]  We'll come back after the break.
[00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:10.452]  InfoWars.com.
[00:15:10.452 --> 00:15:11.552]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:30.254]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:15:30.254 --> 00:15:34.556]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:15:34.556 --> 00:15:39.417]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:16:00.004 --> 00:16:06.908]  The powerful combination of both Vitamin C and Zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[00:16:06.908 --> 00:16:12.811]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.

[00:19:00.103 --> 00:19:13.495]  If you're ruthless megacorporations who've taken over almost every government on earth and who are trying to destroy the middle class in any form of upward mobility, you've got to divide and conquer the public so they don't know they're being targeted.
[00:19:13.495 --> 00:19:21.443]  And that's why the Fortune 100 have wrapped themselves in the name of LBGT and African American rights and all the rest of it all over the world.
[00:19:22.043 --> 00:19:33.557]  That's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in Africa and in Communist China and many other areas, while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through the big tech that the central banks and others own.
[00:19:34.491 --> 00:19:36.012]  So this is a criminal takeover.
[00:19:36.012 --> 00:19:47.541]  And when you look at the new superclass, it's the politicians, it's the corporate media, it's the police, it's the bureaucrats, it's members of Congress and their staff and their families, it's the White House.
[00:19:47.541 --> 00:19:56.887]  Hell, it's postal workers who were all exempt from the poison shots, but not the general public and everybody else through corporate rule.
[00:19:56.887 --> 00:19:58.809]  So this is the true discrimination that's going on.
[00:20:00.327 --> 00:20:06.230]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:20:33.146 --> 00:20:43.995]  Ladies and gentlemen, throughout history, humanity looks at evil organizations and powerful empires and believe that somehow they must have a plan.
[00:20:43.995 --> 00:20:45.657]  They must be invincible.
[00:20:45.657 --> 00:20:52.203]  Why would they be persecuting and enslaving and murdering giant swaths of humanity?
[00:20:54.827 --> 00:20:56.347]  And it's because they are psychotics.
[00:20:56.347 --> 00:20:57.408]  They are evil.
[00:20:57.408 --> 00:20:58.988]  It is a desire they have.
[00:20:58.988 --> 00:21:08.650]  Why did Jeffrey Dahmer kidnap people off the street and inject acid into their brain to turn them into sex slaves that sometimes will live up to a week?
[00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.011]  Lobotomized.
[00:21:10.011 --> 00:21:12.671]  Because he was evil.
[00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:15.632]  Why did he torture to death neighborhood dogs and cats?
[00:21:15.632 --> 00:21:18.273]  Because he liked it.
[00:21:18.273 --> 00:21:21.134]  Why does Bill Gates and Fauci do what they do?
[00:21:21.134 --> 00:21:22.394]  Because they like it.
[00:21:24.218 --> 00:21:30.520]  Thousands of studies, Fauci directly funded, torturing dogs and cats to death.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:36.921]  And I've raised the dog and cat reports that are public because no one cares about the 10,000 plus black children.
[00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:40.602]  That's the main group, almost all black.
[00:21:40.602 --> 00:21:44.783]  Mainstream news in the 90s on the East Coast of New Jersey.
[00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:48.800]  And in New York, and in Maryland, and in D.C.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:56.044]  taking children as young as two from their mothers that were healthy and killing them!
[00:21:56.044 --> 00:22:01.968]  Seven and eight year olds would escape facilities and be chained down and murdered!
[00:22:01.968 --> 00:22:03.029]  MURDERED!
[00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:04.209]  MURDERED!
[00:22:04.209 --> 00:22:07.231]  MURDERED!
[00:22:07.231 --> 00:22:14.896]  These are mad scientists that have set the precedent to do this on the small scale and now they're doing it on the mass scale.
[00:22:16.038 --> 00:22:20.062]  So there are some gigantic seismic developments that have taken place.
[00:22:20.062 --> 00:22:39.002]  The globalists have all their actuaries, all their psychological warfare operatives, all their behavioral psychologists, and they push and push and push and push in Europe, and push and push and push in the UK, and push and push and push in the United States and other areas, until massive resistance formed, and massive resistance kept intensifying
[00:22:40.143 --> 00:22:55.075]  And most importantly, their own families and their own relations that were compartmentalized and not part of the plan began to leave them and began to leak information on them.
[00:22:55.075 --> 00:23:02.521]  And I'm not calling for this, but some people's family members have been quietly killing them.
[00:23:02.521 --> 00:23:05.263]  It's a very personal family thing, isn't it?
[00:23:05.263 --> 00:23:09.347]  So they're under major pressure, the minion class.
[00:23:10.803 --> 00:23:29.414]  And when the Labour Party joined with the Conservative Party, bucking their leadership in both of the main parties in the UK, and had a super majority to end all the lockdowns, all the face masks, all the crap, and remove Boris Johnson.
[00:23:29.414 --> 00:23:33.736]  Remember, he's a Prime Minister.
[00:23:33.736 --> 00:23:38.119]  It's when his party's dominant, they elect who the Prime Minister is.
[00:23:39.468 --> 00:23:45.713]  You're elected generally to the Parliament, but then it's Parliamentary, then the Parliament decides who the leader is.
[00:23:45.713 --> 00:23:53.238]  And so faced with that, they were meeting at Davos this week, and last week they came out in the NIH.
[00:23:54.229 --> 00:23:54.850]  Here in the U.S.
[00:23:54.850 --> 00:24:08.280]  announced, face masks don't work, natural immunity is better than the shot, we shouldn't give it to children, but they put it out as a very quiet press release, just kind of buried to cover their ash.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:19.709]  Then they have their surrogates keep saying, it's the law, you got to do it, it totally works, you're a terrorist if you don't take it, you should die, you should have healthcare taken away, you should be killed, like Howard Stern has now said of the unvaccinated,
[00:24:21.462 --> 00:24:23.143]  But the fact that here in the U.S.
[00:24:23.143 --> 00:24:25.904]  and in the U.K., they came out, when did they come out?
[00:24:25.904 --> 00:24:29.905]  Yesterday, coordinated, and said they're backing down.
[00:24:29.905 --> 00:24:46.651]  Now, where the public, they think, can't escape, and they're doing a beta test with Australia and Canada, that are two smaller populations, they are going to keep squeezing as a laboratory test.
[00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:50.312]  But, everywhere else, they're going to back off for a few months,
[00:24:53.149 --> 00:25:18.847]  And then they're going to use cyber attacks, false flag, and most importantly, they're already pre-programming, as I said they would do, that as soon as they backed off in phase one, they're going to apply the pressure back even more intense soon, they would then announce we need climate lockdowns, we need energy rationing, and they would start imposing rolling blackouts, now starting in the US, now starting in Europe, last week.
[00:25:18.847 --> 00:25:22.510]  And Bill Gates came out and said, we're not focused now mainly on the quote pandemic,
[00:25:23.294 --> 00:25:31.796]  We're now shifting to climate change, the global carbon tax, and the social credit score via your vaccine passports.
[00:25:31.796 --> 00:25:39.938]  And Australia and the EU and Canada have all officially announced the same global UN run system that even has a social credit score at the top.
[00:25:39.938 --> 00:25:42.999]  So it's not coming, it's here.
[00:25:42.999 --> 00:25:46.420]  And then it gets more serious.
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.040]  We have the video coming up next segment.
[00:25:49.315 --> 00:25:57.063]  Creepy Bill Gates gives warning of other pandemics far worse than COVID-19, calls on governments to increase vaccine supplies.
[00:25:59.943 --> 00:26:05.686]  Calls on governments to increase vaccine supplies, which goes money directly to him.
[00:26:05.686 --> 00:26:07.688]  But that's only a means to depopulate us.
[00:26:07.688 --> 00:26:20.936]  He wants the money to have control of the economy and the governments, so he can carry out his psychotic extermination operations, which he publicly calls for, and his father calls for, and his grandfather called for, and they ran the eugenic societies, they ran Planned Parenthood.
[00:26:20.936 --> 00:26:25.518]  They have been the managers for over a hundred years in this country.
[00:26:25.518 --> 00:26:28.020]  They are the sword of Satan.
[00:26:30.779 --> 00:26:33.502]  You gotta give him a nickname, it's the Sword of Satan.
[00:26:33.502 --> 00:26:38.187]  I mean, that is a true demon on Earth.
[00:26:38.187 --> 00:26:39.949]  Incarnate.
[00:26:39.949 --> 00:26:42.612]  Pledge to destroy you and your family.
[00:26:42.612 --> 00:26:46.456]  So, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:46.456 --> 00:26:49.219]  And so they've reached that point where, okay, we pressed them too far, now...
[00:26:50.646 --> 00:26:59.253]  If we keep pushing, they will crystallize political force legally, lawfully, nonviolently, they will take over via civil disobedience, and we will lose all our power.
[00:26:59.253 --> 00:27:06.560]  So, press, press, press, press, press, grab all the power, get as much tracking and control in, steal as much money, kill as many people as you can, and then stop.
[00:27:08.971 --> 00:27:10.392]  But only for a couple weeks.
[00:27:10.392 --> 00:27:21.460]  And then, oh, we're going to bring back some of the lockdowns, and some of the mask rules, and private companies are doing it, and oh, and oh, and this, oh, the governors are still going to do it, or the mayors are still going to do it, and that's already being announced.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:28.264]  But at least, psychologically, they're telling you you're winning, because you are winning, and they want you to just go away now, and not really...
[00:27:29.105 --> 00:27:32.788]  Take action and steal your resolve.
[00:27:32.788 --> 00:27:47.058]  Harden your resolve to carry out the long, cultural, political, economic system it takes for you to run for office and you to file lawsuits and you to take your kids to church and you to work harder and you to get on the straight and narrow, myself included, and repent to God.
[00:27:48.254 --> 00:27:48.714]  No, no, no.
[00:27:48.714 --> 00:27:49.215]  Back off.
[00:27:49.215 --> 00:27:51.256]  Let the good times come back just a little bit.
[00:27:51.256 --> 00:27:52.497]  Not as much as they were before.
[00:27:52.497 --> 00:27:54.978]  And then just keep tightening it slower and slower.
[00:27:54.978 --> 00:27:58.861]  Every time we push back, they let us push back a little.
[00:27:58.861 --> 00:28:01.162]  And then when we relax, they take us even tighter.
[00:28:01.162 --> 00:28:03.704]  And then when we fight back, they kind of release a little.
[00:28:03.704 --> 00:28:05.965]  But soon, you're in the vice grip.
[00:28:05.965 --> 00:28:06.946]  Soon, they've got you.
[00:28:08.211 --> 00:28:09.312]  In their pincer attack.
[00:28:09.312 --> 00:28:13.216]  So they're undermining society, they're accelerating the collapse of civilization.
[00:28:13.216 --> 00:28:14.477]  That's their admitted goal.
[00:28:14.477 --> 00:28:15.519]  They're hitting us from every angle.
[00:28:15.519 --> 00:28:22.165]  But the minute people realize globalism and the New World Order and how it works and read their own documents, it's game over because they're the villains.
[00:28:22.165 --> 00:28:26.890]  They are the author of 90% of the suffering conservatively on the planet.
[00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:29.413]  I mean, these guys are behind almost everything.
[00:28:31.451 --> 00:28:41.536]  The open border, shipping the drugs in, brainwashing our children, annihilating our currencies, hitting us with bioweapons they cooked up themselves and they're the saviors.
[00:28:41.536 --> 00:28:42.457]  It's us or them.
[00:28:42.457 --> 00:28:45.118]  Are you gonna let them destroy your civilization?
[00:28:45.118 --> 00:28:47.780]  Are you gonna stop them going type 1 civilization?
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.941]  Are you gonna stop them keeping us out of space?
[00:28:49.941 --> 00:28:52.502]  Are you gonna let these enemies of humanity win?
[00:28:52.502 --> 00:28:54.143]  I say no!
[00:28:54.143 --> 00:28:54.944]  No!
[00:28:54.944 --> 00:28:56.304]  We're going interstellar.
[00:28:56.304 --> 00:28:57.445]  We're going intergalactic.
[00:29:00.069 --> 00:29:09.237]  Nootropics is a fancy way of saying brain pill, and it is the fastest growing market in supplements in the world, for good reason.
[00:29:09.237 --> 00:29:16.584]  There are a lot of amazing compounds out there, some healthy, some not, that do incredible things in our brains.
[00:29:16.584 --> 00:29:25.953]  And we've tried them all, we've researched them all, and we will not sell you anything that is linked to any problems or any type of toxicity or any type of extreme hangovers.
[00:29:26.553 --> 00:29:31.655]  I mean, because I'm not saying some of our brain products, you won't have a little bit of a letdown once you take them, but that would just be a lie.
[00:29:31.655 --> 00:29:35.816]  But these are very, very clean with compounds that God gave us that are good for you.
[00:29:35.816 --> 00:29:43.339]  And one of our best sellers is back in stock, Brain Force Plus, a good, clean nootropic, a good, clean brain pill.
[00:29:43.339 --> 00:29:45.319]  You can find something stronger, but it's not good for you.
[00:29:45.319 --> 00:29:47.360]  This is a high quality system.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.441]  It's available at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:29:49.441 --> 00:29:52.202]  It's sold out for a long time at 40% off.

[00:30:35.714 --> 00:30:35.914]  Thank you.
[00:30:59.514 --> 00:31:05.440]  Well, here we are in the year 2022, and InfoWars is now more important than it's ever been.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.822]  We are truly in the zeitgeist.
[00:31:06.822 --> 00:31:16.492]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air, and I want to encourage you to take advantage of a true win-win situation, or a 360 win, as I've called it, at InfoWarsTour.com.

[00:31:18.894 --> 00:31:24.899]  Healthier, make you happier, and then defend your body with your immune system against outside attackers.
[00:31:24.899 --> 00:31:29.023]  Ladies and gentlemen, multivitamins are the way to go, but so many of them are synthetic.
[00:31:29.023 --> 00:31:34.488]  Our multivitamin whole food system is one of the best quality multivitamin systems you're going to find.
[00:31:34.488 --> 00:31:37.331]  But regardless of whether you get it from us or somebody else, research it.
[00:31:37.331 --> 00:31:42.936]  It's a whole food multivitamin and get it for you and your family, especially old folks, children.
[00:31:43.596 --> 00:31:45.740]  Everybody needs it, but especially old folks.
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:49.405]  Also, we have Vitamin C and Zinc with Rosehips.
[00:31:49.405 --> 00:31:50.868]  It's also back in stock.
[00:31:50.868 --> 00:31:51.909]  It's at 40% off.
[00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:57.719]  Both of these are available at InfoWareShore.com and BrainForce Plus is back in stock as well at 40% off.
[00:31:59.167 --> 00:32:15.418]  In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[00:32:15.418 --> 00:32:19.080]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:25.785]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[00:32:26.385 --> 00:32:30.469]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now.
[00:32:30.469 --> 00:32:33.211]  We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[00:32:33.211 --> 00:32:34.032]  It's high quality.
[00:32:34.032 --> 00:32:37.235]  It's very, very low cost at infowarestore.com.
[00:32:37.235 --> 00:32:44.621]  Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[00:32:44.621 --> 00:32:48.545]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the info war.
[00:32:48.865 --> 00:32:49.525]  We're good to go.
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:25.623]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:33:25.623 --> 00:33:27.345]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:27.345 --> 00:33:29.006]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:29.006 --> 00:33:37.572]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:37.572 --> 00:33:45.677]  A lot of people tune in and they notice that most of the time I don't cover what is the big establishment breaking news story.
[00:33:45.677 --> 00:33:49.120]  Because most of the time that's just a distraction or a diversion from the real things that are going on.
[00:33:50.253 --> 00:33:56.820]  But today, a lot of the top stories out there, in my opinion, I think you'll probably agree, are pretty important, and I'm going to get to them here in a moment.
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:58.381]  But notice what I did.
[00:33:58.381 --> 00:34:01.665]  I went big picture, or to the root of the matter.
[00:34:01.665 --> 00:34:08.391]  And I need to get you thinking like this, everybody else thinking like this, and I know we can stop these people.
[00:34:08.391 --> 00:34:13.477]  The fact that the ruling class of the planet, the globalists, the Bilderberg Group, the guys that run the Davos Group,
[00:34:15.006 --> 00:34:18.212]  Now said, okay, let's put the brakes on the COVID power grab.
[00:34:18.212 --> 00:34:21.458]  We've gone as far as we can go right now.
[00:34:21.458 --> 00:34:25.826]  This won't be like the limited pullbacks that you saw in the last two years off and on.
[00:34:25.826 --> 00:34:27.229]  This is going to be a major pullback.
[00:34:28.763 --> 00:34:36.206]  But they're going to let their own neurotics and their own minions and their own mayors and their own local leaders still continue to tyrannically enforce the garbage.
[00:34:36.206 --> 00:34:49.931]  But because we've been taking city councils back and taking local governments back, because it's gotten the grassroots angry to take back peacefully, the school boards and the infrastructure, they've gone,
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:35:01.305]  In just a year and a half, the patriots are taking back, as much as George Soros has financed with stolen money, over $10 billion the last decade.
[00:35:01.305 --> 00:35:08.708]  So their games, taking over local cities and towns, in a year and a half of people finally waking up, has been pushed back.
[00:35:08.708 --> 00:35:09.889]  And it's the same thing in Europe.
[00:35:09.889 --> 00:35:11.270]  People are waking up all over.
[00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:15.152]  And Brazil, and other areas of South America.
[00:35:15.152 --> 00:35:16.552]  And Central America's waking up.
[00:35:16.552 --> 00:35:17.733]  And Africa's waking up.
[00:35:17.733 --> 00:35:18.833]  And Asia's waking up.
[00:35:18.833 --> 00:35:19.874]  And the Middle East is waking up.
[00:35:21.385 --> 00:35:23.046]  To the real globalist attack.
[00:35:23.046 --> 00:35:25.446]  But if you don't know about the globalist attack, you don't have a hope.
[00:35:25.446 --> 00:35:39.571]  So, it's a big deal that they've now pivoted, as they said they would do in their white papers, I told you, 22 months ago, I said, when they've pushed as far as they can push, they'll then move it to carbon taxes, social credit scores, and carbon lockdowns.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.121]  And exactly that happened.
[00:35:42.121 --> 00:35:43.623]  And again, I will show you the magic trick.
[00:35:43.623 --> 00:35:44.684]  It's no trick at all.
[00:35:44.684 --> 00:35:51.630]  They write white papers, they write their policy papers, and that is a policy point that you see everywhere.
[00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:57.316]  They don't put these policy points in there because they like to write stuff for no reason.
[00:35:57.316 --> 00:35:57.516]  Okay?
[00:35:59.071 --> 00:36:17.048]  It shut down the real economy, shut down the human economy, shut down the grassroots economy, shut down the mainstream economy, shut down the farming economy, shut down the ranching economy, shut down the national economy, and come in with green deals with a bunch of fiat money they give themselves to put in infrastructure that doesn't work.
[00:36:17.048 --> 00:36:20.832]  But that way they look like they're building the future while they're actually destroying all of our futures.
[00:36:22.466 --> 00:36:23.748]  Agenda 21.
[00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:24.328]  Agenda 2030.
[00:36:24.328 --> 00:36:27.672]  I could play you hundreds of incredibly interesting clips.
[00:36:27.672 --> 00:36:30.796]  I could read all these funny news stories and make the left look like idiots.
[00:36:30.796 --> 00:36:32.678]  And look how stupid Biden is.
[00:36:32.678 --> 00:36:36.142]  He can hardly talk at his press conferences.
[00:36:36.142 --> 00:36:39.766]  But it makes you feel good while you're dying, politically and spiritually.
[00:36:40.569 --> 00:36:41.869]  Yes, he's a buffoon.
[00:36:41.869 --> 00:36:43.110]  Yes, he's a big joke.
[00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:50.131]  But he's designed to do that to discredit the United States and to make us look stupid, while the globalists discredit the nation state.
[00:36:50.131 --> 00:36:51.992]  It was all planned.
[00:36:51.992 --> 00:36:54.753]  He was picked because he's out of his mind.
[00:36:54.753 --> 00:36:59.474]  He was extremely brain damaged years ago.
[00:36:59.474 --> 00:37:01.574]  And now he doesn't know what planet he's on.
[00:37:01.574 --> 00:37:04.595]  Perfect for the enemy.
[00:37:05.942 --> 00:37:09.228]  Because they can then blame him for everything he's doing.
[00:37:09.228 --> 00:37:12.213]  He said, I'm about to sign 50 things, 20 things.
[00:37:12.213 --> 00:37:13.936]  He said it at multiple bill signings.
[00:37:13.936 --> 00:37:15.478]  I have no idea what this is!
[00:37:17.657 --> 00:37:20.838]  And then he looks around and he says, I'm not supposed to read this, am I?
[00:37:20.838 --> 00:37:26.540]  I mean, he's got enough old man humor, even though he's senile, to know he's doing something really dirty.
[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:33.542]  And he's letting the little criminals around him go, hey, my brain may be gone, but I've been around 50 years, 60 years running these scams, kids.
[00:37:33.542 --> 00:37:36.703]  So you may have me up here as your front guy, but don't think I don't know what you're doing.
[00:37:39.042 --> 00:37:41.205]  How sick is that?
[00:37:41.205 --> 00:37:44.991]  He's in on himself being a joke to help bring the country down.
[00:37:44.991 --> 00:37:47.214]  He doesn't care because he wants what you want.
[00:37:47.214 --> 00:37:48.075]  What's he love?
[00:37:48.075 --> 00:37:49.157]  What's he gotta have?
[00:37:49.157 --> 00:37:51.921]  Power over you.
[00:37:51.921 --> 00:37:52.942]  Power.
[00:37:52.942 --> 00:37:53.523]  You know what I want?
[00:37:54.585 --> 00:37:55.826]  Power to be left alone.
[00:37:55.826 --> 00:37:57.348]  Power to live on a ranch.
[00:37:57.348 --> 00:37:59.210]  Power to work in a garden.
[00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.793]  Power to go hunt ducks with dogs.
[00:38:01.793 --> 00:38:03.014]  Power to hike.
[00:38:03.014 --> 00:38:04.476]  Power to love my children.
[00:38:04.476 --> 00:38:05.958]  Power to live a long life.
[00:38:05.958 --> 00:38:11.283]  And if I'm gonna do that, I gotta get that guy and his controllers off our backs.
[00:38:11.283 --> 00:38:12.485]  I don't want your DCC.
[00:38:14.879 --> 00:38:16.040]  Scumhole!
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.320]  I don't want your New York scumhole!
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.961]  I don't want all your elitist scumholes!
[00:38:20.961 --> 00:38:29.545]  It is so important to not just not care about Hollywood, but to hate it, and to absolutely reject it like poison that you've swallowed that you vomit out of your mouth.
[00:38:29.545 --> 00:38:30.365]  Because that's what it is.
[00:38:30.365 --> 00:38:31.886]  It's poison.
[00:38:31.886 --> 00:38:33.906]  Period.
[00:38:33.906 --> 00:38:42.129]  And it is so liberating to not just not care about the system and care about all their little outfits and their festooning themselves and their award ceremonies.
[00:38:42.129 --> 00:38:43.270]  And here's why they're so scared.
[00:38:45.013 --> 00:38:47.414]  All the world is turning against Hollywood.
[00:38:47.414 --> 00:38:50.095]  All the world is turning against the New York elites.
[00:38:50.095 --> 00:38:58.318]  All the world is sick of it, and doesn't worship them, and isn't distracted by them, and in fact, we're disgusted by you.
[00:38:58.318 --> 00:39:00.438]  We're disgusted by Tom Hanks.
[00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:03.239]  We're disgusted by Kamala Harris.
[00:39:03.239 --> 00:39:05.500]  We're disgusted by Joe Biden.
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.701]  We're disgusted by Brad Pitt.
[00:39:07.701 --> 00:39:10.162]  We're disgusted by Leonardo DiCaprio.
[00:39:10.162 --> 00:39:12.242]  We're disgusted by Klaus Schwab.
[00:39:12.242 --> 00:39:13.463]  We're disgusted by the
[00:39:13.923 --> 00:39:14.583]  Pig!
[00:39:14.583 --> 00:39:15.444]  Queen of England!
[00:39:15.444 --> 00:39:18.726]  We're disgusted by all you garbage!
[00:39:18.726 --> 00:39:20.747]  We don't like you!
[00:39:20.747 --> 00:39:36.096]  But instead of wanting to kill you like you want to kill us, we just want you mummies, you vampires, like that end scene in The Hunger, where they're all stumbling around, turning to dust like Bill Clinton, to go climb in your filthy historical graves.
[00:39:37.824 --> 00:39:39.284]  That doesn't mean I want you to die.
[00:39:39.284 --> 00:39:40.365]  You're already dead spiritually.
[00:39:40.365 --> 00:39:44.185]  I'm saying, crawl under the mausoleum.
[00:39:44.185 --> 00:39:47.286]  Crawl into your holes.
[00:39:47.286 --> 00:40:05.350]  Your failures, and you knew you were failures, and you're losers that signed on to evil, and that's why you're so pissed, and you want to drag us and our children with you, with your 5G and 6G poison, and your GMO mutagenic mutation shots, and all of your satanism, and your evil, and your pus.
[00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.551]  You watch CNN.
[00:40:09.551 --> 00:40:10.652]  You watch any of these shows.
[00:40:10.652 --> 00:40:12.052]  You read what the universities teach.
[00:40:12.052 --> 00:40:15.214]  You read what the schools are teaching young children.
[00:40:15.214 --> 00:40:21.637]  And it's all vile, pathetic evil to make you hate yourself and to make you feel alone.
[00:40:21.637 --> 00:40:24.498]  And then, oh, don't look up with Leonardo DiCaprio.
[00:40:24.498 --> 00:40:27.780]  A big comet's coming to kill everybody on Earth.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.521]  And then he goes, hey, the real comet is you, the humans.
[00:40:30.521 --> 00:40:31.642]  We're the comet.
[00:40:31.642 --> 00:40:33.082]  We've got to kill ourselves.
[00:40:33.082 --> 00:40:34.023]  He actually says that.
[00:40:35.484 --> 00:40:38.206]  It starts with you, DiCaprio.
[00:40:38.206 --> 00:40:45.752]  It starts with you, sitting out there on your back porch with an HD camera, pouring gasoline all over yourself, and lighting yourself on fire.
[00:40:45.752 --> 00:40:47.194]  Then I will respect you.
[00:40:47.194 --> 00:41:00.865]  When you self-immolate for the earth and say, I'm the most degenerate, spoiled piece of filth from the Devo script that believes in depopulation, I believe humanity should die, I believe there's too many people, and I believe that the rich are over-consuming, and so now,
[00:41:02.332 --> 00:41:20.196]  I'm going to take this gallon of gasoline, I'm going to pour it all over myself, and I'm going to take a little torch lighter, and I'm going to say, for the earth, for Bambi, and then no fire extinguishers, just sit there and barbecue yourself until you die.
[00:41:20.196 --> 00:41:27.137]  I'm not going to hurt you, I wish you a long life, but if you want to hate us, and you want to teach us we're a disease, and you want us to die,
[00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:53.861]  I say to you, you selfish little Hollywood pig, you little Hollywood piece of trash, that if you had any discernment or connection to God in the universe and the divine, you would know that wanting to hurt poor people and wanting to depopulate the planet so you and your other pig-like creatures like Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates can slither around, that your elitism is an affront to God.
[00:41:56.024 --> 00:42:00.327]  And you see the imperfections in others and think you're so perfect that you don't want to look at us?
[00:42:00.327 --> 00:42:02.989]  Well, we don't want to look at you.
[00:42:02.989 --> 00:42:05.731]  And we're not going to hurt a little hair on your chinny-chin-chin.
[00:42:05.731 --> 00:42:09.674]  But we ask you, have some honor.
[00:42:09.674 --> 00:42:19.020]  Like a Japanese samurai, you got the will to shove a short sword in right here on your right side and pull it all the way up the middle and then turn it and stick it in your heart?
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:19.881]  With control?
[00:42:19.881 --> 00:42:21.302]  No, you're not like that.
[00:42:21.302 --> 00:42:22.483]  You want us to die.
[00:42:22.483 --> 00:42:23.944]  You don't have the will to do that, do you?
[00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:28.471]  You are a spoiled little maggot!
[00:42:28.471 --> 00:42:32.753]  You are the most uncool, biggest loser on Earth!
[00:42:32.753 --> 00:42:42.317]  And I pray to God, not any man, but I pray to God to bring you to justice and to bring you down low as an example to the world.
[00:42:42.317 --> 00:42:51.381]  And I hope the audience prays with me that God bring vengeance on Klaus Schwab's little pupil, Leonardo DiCaprio.
[00:42:51.381 --> 00:42:52.902]  You want us to die, DiCaprio?
[00:42:54.261 --> 00:42:56.343]  I say God's got you in his sights!
[00:43:13.539 --> 00:43:15.720]  The days of independent media are numbered.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:19.241]  The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[00:43:19.241 --> 00:43:22.122]  They are now debanking us behind the scenes.
[00:43:22.122 --> 00:43:25.003]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[00:43:25.003 --> 00:43:31.046]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps.
[00:43:31.046 --> 00:43:33.527]  The traitors know they can shut us down by force.
[00:43:34.327 --> 00:43:37.548]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[00:43:37.548 --> 00:43:39.049]  So be it.
[00:43:39.049 --> 00:43:41.430]  Make them silence us by force.
[00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:44.431]  This is the final battle of the information war.
[00:43:44.431 --> 00:43:45.691]  Give now.
[00:43:45.691 --> 00:43:46.551]  Buy products.
[00:43:46.551 --> 00:43:47.432]  Donate.
[00:43:47.432 --> 00:43:50.213]  Before everything changes.
[00:43:50.213 --> 00:43:53.074]  We need you to carry us through to the end.
[00:43:53.074 --> 00:43:54.454]  Victory or death.
[00:43:54.454 --> 00:43:56.535]  Go now to infowarestore.com.
[00:43:58.863 --> 00:44:07.108]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines are working for, quote, dark forces.
[00:44:07.108 --> 00:44:14.472]  That the FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these evil groups are.
[00:44:14.472 --> 00:44:19.314]  They know that all over the world their poison shot is being banned by major governments.
[00:44:19.314 --> 00:44:21.596]  And Moderna's in trouble as well.
[00:44:21.596 --> 00:44:25.578]  They know that the people are starting to get wise to the depopulation agenda.
[00:44:26.485 --> 00:44:38.237]  In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons, but they're so deadly, they're killing a higher percentage up front, and so people are waking up.
[00:44:38.237 --> 00:44:41.460]  The weapons work a little too good.
[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:46.265]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars, but instead, they're making too big of a noise!
[00:44:46.986 --> 00:44:49.128]  But it's too late for them to turn back now.
[00:44:49.128 --> 00:44:50.889]  They're coming after our children.
[00:44:50.889 --> 00:44:55.973]  So it's up to us to protect our little children, or God will not look favorably on us.
[00:44:55.973 --> 00:44:58.615]  Remember, God is watching.
[00:44:58.615 --> 00:45:08.743]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp in World War II that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group, so he didn't stand up.
[00:45:08.743 --> 00:45:13.127]  And then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group, so he didn't stand up.
[00:45:13.127 --> 00:45:13.687]  And finally,
[00:45:14.548 --> 00:45:16.629]  And they can't apprehend those, nobody else can stand up.
[00:45:16.629 --> 00:45:21.493]  Well, the global social credit score that China's putting in, it's banning people to three hours of video games a week.
[00:45:21.493 --> 00:45:25.495]  And if you criticize the government, you can never buy or sell again.
[00:45:25.495 --> 00:45:29.598]  Well, that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of COVID.
[00:45:29.598 --> 00:45:31.559]  Vaccine passports, they even admit it now.
[00:45:31.559 --> 00:45:34.181]  They're saying there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it.
[00:45:34.181 --> 00:45:38.624]  They're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what you can do.
[00:45:38.624 --> 00:45:40.405]  That's what the lockdowns are about.
[00:45:40.405 --> 00:45:41.966]  You'll accept that, you'll accept anything.
[00:45:43.055 --> 00:45:48.979]  So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny, pretending like they're part of the power structure.
[00:45:48.979 --> 00:45:51.060]  But they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well.
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:57.524]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them, or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:04.586]  Well, here we are in the year 2022, and InfoWars is now more important than it's ever been.
[00:46:04.586 --> 00:46:05.928]  We are truly in the zeitgeist.
[00:46:05.928 --> 00:46:15.618]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air, and I want to encourage you to take advantage of a true win-win situation, or a 360 win, as I've called it, at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:46:15.618 --> 00:46:17.480]  Get high-quality supplements that make your body.
[00:46:18.021 --> 00:46:18.902]  I think so.
[00:46:42.739 --> 00:46:44.860]  Everybody needs it, but especially old folks.
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:48.522]  Also, we have Vitamin C and Zinc with Rosehips.
[00:46:48.522 --> 00:46:49.983]  It's also back in stock.
[00:46:49.983 --> 00:46:51.784]  It's at 40% off.
[00:46:51.784 --> 00:47:00.449]  Both of these are available at InfoWarshore.com and BrainForce Plus is back in stock as well at 40% off.
[00:47:00.449 --> 00:47:06.253]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:20.950]  Now you know.
[00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:36.315]  You better get busy, because the globalists are collapsing your civilization, your home world.
[00:47:36.315 --> 00:47:41.236]  Your planet is under attack, not just humans.
[00:47:41.236 --> 00:47:46.998]  Call these people what you want, but they're not fighting for the home team.
[00:47:50.464 --> 00:47:53.627]  Anybody can look at that and see that they are out to play God.
[00:47:53.627 --> 00:47:58.472]  That's why they say that the guardians of the earth because they're busy destroying the earth.
[00:47:58.472 --> 00:48:00.074]  I want to talk about solutions right now.
[00:48:00.074 --> 00:48:10.404]  The next hour, I'll get into Joe Biden's press conference, because even though it's a distraction just to make fun of him and laugh at him and not realize that that's he's a puppet, a front man to take the blame, he deserves blame.
[00:48:10.404 --> 00:48:13.748]  But we need to go after those politically by exposing those that run him.
[00:48:14.758 --> 00:48:23.965]  But his amazing statement of apparently green-lighting Russia going into Ukraine, as long as the incursion isn't too much, what does that mean?
[00:48:23.965 --> 00:48:38.596]  And Bill Gates again saying, oh, more deadly viruses are coming, and I'm sure he'll own and run and control the lab programs that will create the next virus and release it on us and it'll be admitted, because he wants you to know he did it to you.
[00:48:38.596 --> 00:48:39.917]  It's funny to him.
[00:48:39.917 --> 00:48:40.818]  He thinks he's invincible.
[00:48:43.615 --> 00:48:46.616]  That's all coming up, but I want to talk about some solutions here.
[00:48:46.616 --> 00:48:52.558]  We have this amazing member of the European Union Parliament, Christina Anderson.
[00:48:52.558 --> 00:48:59.260]  She made another powerful statement about tyranny and the fact that governments are targeting you and are predatory because evil is in control of them at the top.
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:05.541]  It doesn't mean the whole government's evil, it means the evil sees control and we've got to get aware of that and stop it.
[00:49:05.541 --> 00:49:07.362]  And another very well-spoken lawyer,
[00:49:11.221 --> 00:49:13.622]  In New York, giving a fiery speech.
[00:49:13.622 --> 00:49:16.722]  But first, here's the Member of Parliament in the European Union.
[00:49:16.722 --> 00:49:30.585]  Sarah Klit, a Greek philosopher living in the 5th century BC, once said, the truth often evades being recognized due to its utter incredibility.
[00:49:30.585 --> 00:49:39.227]  So just because you cannot fathom your government having ill meanings towards you, doesn't mean it is not true.
[00:49:40.461 --> 00:49:44.846]  And on the other hand, I'd much rather be wrong than sorry.
[00:49:44.846 --> 00:49:46.247]  But it's up to you.
[00:49:46.247 --> 00:49:49.691]  You need to decide what you will do.
[00:49:49.691 --> 00:49:55.757]  But keep in mind, whatever decision you do make, you will not only make it for yourself,
[00:49:56.738 --> 00:50:03.481]  This decision will be made for your children and your children's children as well.
[00:50:03.481 --> 00:50:10.785]  Your decision today will shape the society your children will have to live in.
[00:50:10.785 --> 00:50:21.050]  Your decision today will predetermine whether your children will live in a free and democratic society or if they will be subjected to a surveillancing police state.
[00:50:22.256 --> 00:50:28.664]  Now I am determined to leave my children a free and democratic society.
[00:50:28.664 --> 00:50:33.209]  And this I will fight for tooth and nail.
[00:50:33.209 --> 00:50:36.813]  And should it be the last thing I do on this planet, so be it.
[00:50:37.802 --> 00:50:42.484]  So once again, dear government, bring it on.
[00:50:42.484 --> 00:50:44.505]  Let's see what you've got.
[00:50:44.505 --> 00:50:46.946]  I am not afraid of you.
[00:50:46.946 --> 00:50:49.147]  You will not be able to shut me up.
[00:50:49.147 --> 00:50:51.908]  You will not be able to force me into compliance.
[00:50:53.087 --> 00:50:55.409]  Oh, and one other thing?
[00:50:55.409 --> 00:50:57.531]  Trying to buy me off?
[00:50:57.531 --> 00:50:57.912]  Really?
[00:50:57.912 --> 00:51:00.254]  That isn't going to work either.
[00:51:00.254 --> 00:51:02.977]  So go ahead, offer me a million dollars.
[00:51:02.977 --> 00:51:07.100]  Heck, make it a hundred million dollars.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.302]  But you know what?
[00:51:08.302 --> 00:51:17.350]  Securing a future for my children in a free and democratic society, you could not possibly put a price tag on that.
[00:51:18.451 --> 00:51:26.015]  So when it comes to my stand on that issue, I would like to put it in the words of Margaret Thatcher.
[00:51:26.015 --> 00:51:30.017]  This lady is not for turning.
[00:51:30.017 --> 00:51:31.258]  You can bet on that.
[00:51:31.258 --> 00:51:33.018]  Thank you.
[00:51:33.018 --> 00:51:37.521]  Yeah, you won't see, though, anybody pushing her to be a president or prime minister because they don't want real powerful women up there.
[00:51:37.521 --> 00:51:39.602]  They want puppet women just like puppet men.
[00:51:39.602 --> 00:51:41.963]  And here's another amazing lady.
[00:51:41.963 --> 00:51:46.205]  This is a Tricia Lindsey, a speech this lawyer gave in New York.
[00:51:46.205 --> 00:51:47.326]  Here's just part of it.
[00:51:47.326 --> 00:51:47.826]  It's powerful.
[00:51:49.592 --> 00:51:50.653]  We're good to go.
[00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:19.772]  The churches are surrendering their pulpits to the demonic hustle.
[00:52:19.772 --> 00:52:21.112]  I'm not coming to your church.
[00:52:21.112 --> 00:52:25.134]  You're not getting my time.
[00:52:25.134 --> 00:52:27.855]  Are you crazy?
[00:52:27.855 --> 00:52:29.616]  Take your children out of school.
[00:52:29.616 --> 00:52:32.357]  I'm a former educator, 24 years.
[00:52:32.357 --> 00:52:34.217]  They stopped teaching them years ago.
[00:52:34.217 --> 00:52:35.138]  You just didn't know.
[00:52:36.238 --> 00:52:36.819]  That!
[00:52:36.819 --> 00:52:37.499]  That!
[00:52:37.499 --> 00:52:37.779]  That!
[00:52:37.779 --> 00:52:37.999]  That!
[00:52:37.999 --> 00:52:38.359]  Yup!
[00:52:38.359 --> 00:52:38.520]  Yup!
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:38.700]  Yup!
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:38.920]  Yup!
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:39.240]  Yup!
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:39.440]  Yup!
[00:52:59.993 --> 00:53:08.536]  I don't care how you look at it, but if you're in corporate America, you're imprisoned by your lifestyle.
[00:53:08.536 --> 00:53:12.557]  If you're in the government, you're imprisoned by your child with good benefits.
[00:53:12.557 --> 00:53:13.578]  You understand?
[00:53:13.578 --> 00:53:16.879]  If you are on subsidy, you're imprisoned by their benefits.
[00:53:16.879 --> 00:53:22.280]  We have to get out their system, pull yourselves out, pull your dollars out, and level it!
[00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.770]  That's right.
[00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:25.851]  Level the system.
[00:53:25.851 --> 00:53:26.913]  It's not here for you.
[00:53:26.913 --> 00:53:33.803]  It's a parasitic system that is destroying our American system, a clouded pivot, to collapse us, to control us.
[00:53:33.803 --> 00:53:36.427]  The system is collapsing us.
[00:53:36.427 --> 00:53:38.170]  We have to collapse the collapse.
[00:53:39.977 --> 00:53:46.518]  We have to defend our republic and our human system and our rule of law and what America was and our institutions that are real.
[00:53:46.518 --> 00:53:48.799]  It doesn't matter if the enemies captured them all.
[00:53:48.799 --> 00:53:54.220]  Klaus Schwab brags, we control their governments, we'll have them carry out dirty work, then we come in and save you.
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:59.541]  It's the oldest trick in the book.
[00:53:59.541 --> 00:54:06.703]  Now, let's hear from somebody who, I've been on his show 30 years ago, very crude, very nasty, but he supported free speech, he claimed.
[00:54:06.703 --> 00:54:07.263]  Now he doesn't.
[00:54:09.085 --> 00:54:11.626]  And here's Howard Stern just saying, go home and die.
[00:54:11.626 --> 00:54:15.927]  Well, A, if you've already had natural immunity, you can get really sick taking these shots.
[00:54:15.927 --> 00:54:17.848]  The American Medical Association admits that.
[00:54:17.848 --> 00:54:19.949]  They now admit it can cause heart attacks and blood clots.
[00:54:19.949 --> 00:54:21.609]  They admit it doesn't protect you.
[00:54:21.609 --> 00:54:22.309]  All this is out.
[00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:24.690]  The CDC's now come out and said, masks don't work.
[00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:25.931]  We already knew that.
[00:54:25.931 --> 00:54:30.592]  But here's Howard Stern doubling down, obviously being paid to do it.
[00:54:30.592 --> 00:54:33.053]  And we need Pfizer and others investigated.
[00:54:34.753 --> 00:54:36.614]  For the billions they admit they paid in the U.S.
[00:54:36.614 --> 00:54:41.075]  alone to quote influencers to get up there and spout their lies, especially on Sesame Street.
[00:54:41.075 --> 00:54:49.098]  Because under law, that's not an authorized audience to be pushing drugs on because it's not approved for them.
[00:54:49.098 --> 00:54:52.359]  And I've had expert lawyers on, so has Joe Rogan about this.
[00:54:52.359 --> 00:54:54.480]  That's illegal, folks.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.820]  We've got to start standing up for ourselves.
[00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:59.761]  But here is Howard Stern.
[00:54:59.761 --> 00:55:01.122]  Go home and die.
[00:55:02.754 --> 00:55:13.638]  Oh, if you're at the hospital for a heart attack, or a stroke, or a broken leg, or a dog bite, if you don't have the vaccine card, you get sent home.
[00:55:13.638 --> 00:55:15.019]  Wow!
[00:55:15.019 --> 00:55:26.043]  The guy's worth hundreds of millions of dollars, his ancestors fled to America to find freedom, and now he's the closest thing, and this isn't a joke to a Nazi, you can imagine.
[00:55:27.614 --> 00:55:28.175]  Good, Howard.
[00:55:28.175 --> 00:55:28.955]  How are you doing today?
[00:55:28.955 --> 00:55:31.858]  I wanted to know your opinion.
[00:55:31.858 --> 00:55:34.300]  You know, we've been in this pandemic for the past two years.
[00:55:51.663 --> 00:55:57.227]  And we're sacrificing all these resources towards people who aren't vaccinated.
[00:55:57.227 --> 00:56:05.572]  What would you think about just letting the pandemic run wild and move through the unvaccinated?
[00:56:05.572 --> 00:56:07.754]  Now, I know you're calling me.
[00:56:07.754 --> 00:56:11.696]  I know you're calling me from the ancient city of Atlantis.
[00:56:11.696 --> 00:56:18.181]  I know you're underwater, so I'm going to answer you quickly.
[00:56:18.181 --> 00:56:19.902]  Look, here's the thing.
[00:56:21.223 --> 00:56:23.444]  As Robert just pointed out, it's happening.
[00:56:23.444 --> 00:56:29.025]  Now, if it was up to me, anyone unvaccinated would not be admitted to a hospital.
[00:56:29.025 --> 00:56:32.986]  At this point, they've been given plenty of opportunity to get the vaccine.
[00:56:32.986 --> 00:56:42.449]  They've been told by our nation's... They've been told that you will die if you don't have the vaccine.
[00:56:42.449 --> 00:56:46.290]  Some of you will live, but most of you will die.
[00:56:46.290 --> 00:56:47.590]  And they don't trust...
[00:56:50.165 --> 00:56:52.205]  All right, so it goes on from there.
[00:56:52.205 --> 00:56:53.906]  It doesn't work, you liar.
[00:56:53.906 --> 00:56:55.626]  And you signed on to the wrong side of history.
[00:56:55.626 --> 00:56:57.287]  So did Trump.
[00:56:57.287 --> 00:56:59.907]  So I don't care if you're Howard Stern or Trump or who the hell you are.
[00:56:59.907 --> 00:57:03.928]  This shot doesn't work other than giving you heart attacks and cancer and blood clots.
[00:57:03.928 --> 00:57:06.569]  And that's the reality, Howard.
[00:57:06.569 --> 00:57:09.709]  So you just keep taking that shot, buddy, if you're naive enough to believe in the system.
[00:57:09.709 --> 00:57:11.130]  You're not gonna be alive very long.
[00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:11.870]  And that's your fault.
[00:57:13.134 --> 00:57:14.875]  But the system wants to ration care.
[00:57:14.875 --> 00:57:16.015]  They want death panels.
[00:57:16.015 --> 00:57:22.718]  And they want to be able to persecute a minority first, which is almost a majority, of the uninjected, so they can then persecute everybody else.
[00:57:22.718 --> 00:57:24.198]  Where have we heard of that before?
[00:57:24.198 --> 00:57:26.959]  Howard Stern is a clear and present danger to this country.
[00:57:26.959 --> 00:57:28.060]  He's anti-free speech.
[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:29.280]  He's anti-American.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:30.941]  And he is an enemy of the American people.
[00:57:31.681 --> 00:57:34.603]  Howard Stern is everything you don't want to be.
[00:57:34.603 --> 00:57:39.526]  And so are the rest of these trashy, rich, New York elites that literally hate America.
[00:57:39.526 --> 00:57:42.628]  You guys are parasites, and you're a shame.
[00:57:42.628 --> 00:57:44.670]  And God's gonna bring justice to you.
[00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:45.770]  Make no mistake.
[00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:46.651]  God will make you pay.
[00:57:49.127 --> 00:57:55.354]  Hey N4 Warriors, if you're like me, you've been a long time listener of this program, and you're fed up with everything going on in the world.
[00:57:55.354 --> 00:57:59.018]  Inside you, like me, a fire is burning.
[00:57:59.018 --> 00:58:00.320]  Something needs to change.
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:02.562]  And yet, we feel helpless.
[00:58:02.562 --> 00:58:06.567]  Almost like we're stuck inside a system that someone else created for us.
[00:58:06.567 --> 00:58:08.429]  It's time for us to break free from that system.
[00:58:08.809 --> 00:58:11.431]  Reset Wars is a game changer.
[00:58:11.431 --> 00:58:16.555]  You start to see yourself more as part of the solution instead of just as a victim.
[00:58:16.555 --> 00:58:24.621]  So much of the stuff we look at today is low vibration, low energy, and makes us depressed and therefore we manifest this negative reality out there.
[00:58:24.621 --> 00:58:30.086]  When they feel their lychee steel plan to enslave and rob the people, there is an awakening.
[00:58:30.086 --> 00:58:33.108]  Reset Wars has helped me to navigate
[00:58:33.508 --> 00:58:39.789]  And to pinpoint and lock onto the deep-rooted psychological tactics that were being used against me.
[00:58:39.789 --> 00:58:41.470]  And now I'm not scared anymore.
[00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:43.370]  I have to say I was blown away.
[00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:46.911]  I feel so much better every day listening to it.
[00:58:46.911 --> 00:58:49.651]  To Alex, thank you very much for putting the course together.
[00:58:49.651 --> 00:58:51.191]  You're absolutely right.
[00:58:51.191 --> 00:58:53.532]  We are reflections of God.
[00:58:53.532 --> 00:58:55.052]  We are emanations of that.
[00:58:55.052 --> 00:58:59.333]  And we can use that God energy to do really anything we want to do in this life.
[00:58:59.773 --> 00:59:04.198]  Romans Chapter 12, Paul talks about how we're transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[00:59:04.198 --> 00:59:05.319]  And that's a process.
[00:59:05.319 --> 00:59:08.383]  Most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious.
[00:59:08.383 --> 00:59:10.886]  Most people go through their day and don't think about many things.
[00:59:10.886 --> 00:59:14.189]  You can drive along a long journey and not even remember half the trip.
[00:59:14.650 --> 00:59:21.794]  In this process, we need to have a concerted, active effort, physically and mentally, to reprogram that subconscious mind.
[00:59:21.794 --> 00:59:25.396]  That's what this series is about, is resetting our mind.
[00:59:25.396 --> 00:59:27.057]  Because there's a war on for our mind.
[00:59:27.057 --> 00:59:28.338]  He's exactly right.
[00:59:28.338 --> 00:59:33.020]  And he's become a great voice in our generation and in this new Great Awakening.
[00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:37.763]  And I encourage everybody out there, if you haven't gone there yet, go to ResetWars.com.
[00:59:37.763 --> 00:59:39.124]  That's where your journey begins.
[00:59:50.618 --> 00:59:55.239]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:55.239 --> 01:00:01.640]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.261]  You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain.
[01:00:04.261 --> 01:00:07.742]  Too much love drives a man insane.
[01:00:07.742 --> 01:00:10.322]  You broke my will, a pull of three.
[01:00:10.322 --> 01:00:13.443]  Nonetheless, grace is great balls of fire.
[01:00:18.116 --> 01:00:23.719]  All right, here's what we're going to do.
[01:00:23.719 --> 01:00:30.441]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to air a very important report dealing with the wheels coming off the establishment.
[01:00:30.441 --> 01:00:33.643]  Co-booster shots diminish immune system.
[01:00:33.643 --> 01:00:37.785]  Our great Wilson did a report on this that we're going to air here in just a moment.
[01:00:37.785 --> 01:00:40.986]  And I'm going to come back, and I'm going to cover news and play clubs and try to drown a little bit.
[01:00:42.455 --> 01:00:46.181]  Dr. Steve Pachinik was going to be on today, but he had some type of family emergency.
[01:00:46.181 --> 01:00:50.648]  He said he won't be back for two weeks, so I'm going to get him back on in two weeks when he gets back.
[01:00:50.648 --> 01:00:53.914]  But Joel Skalzin, who I've been trying to get on for a month, he's going to be joining us.
[01:00:53.914 --> 01:00:55.737]  But first, here's Wilson's report.
[01:00:55.737 --> 01:00:56.859]  You can find it banned on video.
[01:01:02.554 --> 01:01:19.009]  On January 11th, the European Union's drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency, cast doubt on the continual use of COVID booster shots, although they overwhelmingly advocate for the use of COVID vaccines and praise their effectiveness.
[01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:27.036]  Marco Cavallari, the EMA's head of biological health threats and vaccine strategy, explained last week in a briefing.
[01:01:27.296 --> 01:01:40.183]  While use of an additional booster shot could be considered as part of a contingency plan, repeated vaccinations within short intervals would not represent a sustainable long-term strategy.
[01:01:40.183 --> 01:01:46.426]  And the World Health Organization's head Tedros agreed with this assessment the very next day.
[01:01:46.426 --> 01:01:54.491]  Ted Kovac also said that a vaccination strategy based on repeated booster doses of the original vaccine composition
[01:01:55.292 --> 01:01:57.484]  is unlikely to be sustainable.
[01:01:57.884 --> 01:02:10.392]  Later, during that same press briefing, Marco Cavallari stated that the agency was concerned about continually giving booster shots within a short amount of time, just as the whole world has been doing.
[01:02:10.392 --> 01:02:19.337]  We have not seen yet data with respect to a fourth dose, and we would like to see this data before we can make any recommendation.
[01:02:19.337 --> 01:02:26.742]  But at the same time, we are rather concerned about a strategy that entangles repeated vaccination within a short term.
[01:02:27.322 --> 01:02:42.307]  So, this is something that should be part of an overarching strategy on what could be the best strategy for vaccination over time, making clear that we cannot really continuously give a booster dose every 3-4 months.
[01:02:42.307 --> 01:02:54.251]  On January 18th, the European Medicines Agency held another press briefing where Cavallari finally admitted that the COVID booster shots reduced the level of antibodies in its recipients.
[01:02:54.731 --> 01:03:01.256]  I would like also to take the opportunity to again clarify our current position on multiple booster doses.
[01:03:01.256 --> 01:03:17.509]  The repeated administration of boosters with very short interval might reduce the level of antibodies that can be produced at each administration as our immune system needs a certain amount of time to mature the response to the antigens it is presented with.
[01:03:17.509 --> 01:03:21.552]  So potentially making the vaccination a little bit less efficient over time.
[01:03:21.812 --> 01:03:34.226]  Not only is this not new news, but this has been known for months as Dr. David Bauer, a virologist from the Francis Crick Institute, explained about the Pfizer vaccine in June 2021.
[01:03:36.749 --> 01:03:37.169]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:03:58.232 --> 01:04:00.633]  So we found that that's less for people with two doses.
[01:04:00.633 --> 01:04:09.717]  We've also found that for people with only one dose of the Pfizer jab, that they are less likely to have high levels of these antibodies in their blood.
[01:04:09.717 --> 01:04:17.680]  And perhaps most importantly for all of us going forward, is that we see that the older you are, the lower your levels are likely to be.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:23.742]  And the time since you've had your second jab, as that time goes on, the lower your levels are also likely to be.
[01:04:24.082 --> 01:04:37.871]  So, if the vaccines lower immunity, and this information is being shared from scientists to the European Medicines Agency to the World Health Organization, then what is the real motivation behind the booster?
[01:04:37.871 --> 01:04:38.991]  Politics?
[01:04:38.991 --> 01:04:39.652]  Money?
[01:04:39.652 --> 01:04:40.472]  Death?
[01:04:40.472 --> 01:04:44.375]  All I know is that the booster shots are officially busted.
[01:04:44.375 --> 01:04:48.017]  This is Brian Wilson with InfoWars.com.
[01:04:52.694 --> 01:04:54.595]  Alright folks, start your engines.
[01:04:54.595 --> 01:04:59.218]  Massive news in 60 seconds.
[01:04:59.218 --> 01:05:06.142]  The powerful combination of both Vitamin C and Zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[01:05:06.142 --> 01:05:12.025]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[01:05:12.025 --> 01:05:18.389]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C plus Zinc with Rosehips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[01:05:18.709 --> 01:05:25.917]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[01:05:25.917 --> 01:05:36.208]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[01:05:36.628 --> 01:05:45.637]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[01:05:45.637 --> 01:05:52.223]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[01:05:52.223 --> 01:05:58.429]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[01:06:13.204 --> 01:06:25.594]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:25.594 --> 01:06:29.757]  Well, here's some of the headlines in AR Bombshell.
[01:06:29.757 --> 01:06:39.005]  CDC admits natural immunity superior to vaccinated immunity alone and preventing COVID hospitalizations and deaths.
[01:06:39.997 --> 01:06:43.438]  Well, that's what the Israeli study said, 13 to 27 times better a year ago.
[01:06:43.438 --> 01:06:58.385]  And it's just another major official CDC study, CDC.gov, finding that it is just orders of magnitude better and doesn't destroy your immune system later like the COVID shots do.
[01:06:58.385 --> 01:06:59.765]  But that's just science, you know.
[01:06:59.765 --> 01:07:01.706]  I mean, what's your source on that?
[01:07:01.706 --> 01:07:03.067]  Oh, the CDC.
[01:07:03.067 --> 01:07:06.088]  The NCAA stuns the sports world.
[01:07:07.526 --> 01:07:10.086]  By admitting natural immunity is real.
[01:07:10.086 --> 01:07:12.407]  Oh my gosh, did they admit the moon's real?
[01:07:12.407 --> 01:07:13.447]  Or maybe the sun's real?
[01:07:13.447 --> 01:07:14.747]  Or maybe they're real?
[01:07:14.747 --> 01:07:22.769]  Oh, I mean, I love how we're having a debate because Facebook and Twitter and Google wouldn't let you say that natural immunity for the last 20-something months exists, remember?
[01:07:22.769 --> 01:07:29.870]  I mean, Rand Paul, a doctor, said it's better and read studies and he got censored off Google, YouTube!
[01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:32.090]  For that and saying maths don't work.
[01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:34.611]  I mean, oh my gosh!
[01:07:34.611 --> 01:07:35.311]  Did you know?
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:50.190]  That the NCAA now admits natural immunity exists, that we live before we had antibiotics and shots, and that antibiotics and shots may work as a stopgap, but overall lower our general health and immunity, which we all know.
[01:07:50.190 --> 01:08:01.639]  Vaccines and antibiotics work pretty good, whether or not tainted or have problems, especially the shots, but then they kill you down the road, and they're connected to cancer, especially the vaccines.
[01:08:01.639 --> 01:08:03.420]  So it just continues, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:04.997 --> 01:08:15.441]  They're now saying, okay, yeah, we count natural immunity and we're not going to try to keep people out of the football games and we're not going to keep players out and all the rest of this stuff.
[01:08:15.441 --> 01:08:18.021]  And you know, we just got to go ahead and get this and get over it.
[01:08:18.021 --> 01:08:21.343]  Then our body learns how to defeat it.
[01:08:21.343 --> 01:08:23.403]  Absolutely insane.
[01:08:23.403 --> 01:08:25.324]  And it continues.
[01:08:25.324 --> 01:08:33.527]  Coming up, we have a first look at Biden's inaugural TV program to tell you how great the economy is and how wonderful it all is.
[01:08:35.134 --> 01:08:43.881]  That's coming up with Tom Hanks in the last segment of this hour.
[01:08:43.881 --> 01:08:54.969]  But right now I wanted to shift gears into Joe Biden and his Ukraine statement.
[01:08:58.035 --> 01:09:02.437]  And if you want to know the type of statements that start wars, this is it.
[01:09:02.437 --> 01:09:24.006]  If I wanted to start a war with Russia, I would have a stumbling, doddering person, clearly with dementia, a dirty old pervert, pedophile man, licking his lips and stumbling around and not knowing where he is minute to minute, sending troops in to surround Russia all over its western border with Europe.
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.121]  With the head of NATO and top U.S.
[01:09:27.121 --> 01:09:31.264]  generals saying, we're ready to nuke Russia first, and U.S.
[01:09:31.264 --> 01:09:38.829]  senators saying, we may nuke Russia, and nuclear war is survivable.
[01:09:38.829 --> 01:09:45.634]  This isn't Stanley Kubrick's 1964 Dr. Strangelove, where you had generals saying that hypothetically.
[01:09:45.634 --> 01:09:47.135]  This is actually happening.
[01:09:47.135 --> 01:09:53.940]  Of course, that was based on Curtis LeMay, the head of the Air Force, famously saying that to Congress.
[01:09:54.704 --> 01:09:57.826]  It was based on something real.
[01:09:57.826 --> 01:10:04.551]  And so now he's come out and said, well, if the incursion isn't too deep, we might not do anything.
[01:10:04.551 --> 01:10:12.817]  Well, they've got to make a land bridge to Crimea that they've already seized to supply, because the globalists six years ago started a civil war in Ukraine.
[01:10:12.817 --> 01:10:17.000]  And this is on not Russia's doorstep, but in its birthplace.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.204]  Russia started in Ukraine.
[01:10:22.204 --> 01:10:22.684]  It started.
[01:10:26.798 --> 01:10:30.639]  In Eastern Ukraine.
[01:10:30.639 --> 01:10:44.403]  And they need that land bridge, and they need control of that port they've got there, and it's a strategic thing for the Russians to have that land bridge to Crimea.
[01:10:44.403 --> 01:10:55.586]  And so a statement where you're building force, and you're threatening to attack through all your surrogates, but then you say, go ahead Putin, I won't get too upset if you just take over part of Ukraine,
[01:10:56.781 --> 01:10:59.404]  Is just, just absolutely over the top.
[01:10:59.404 --> 01:11:12.660]  But that's what happens when you've got a globalist elite that owns the media, the banks, feels invincible, put a puppet up there to discredit the presidency, but now he's a little too brain dead and the wheels are coming off this thing.
[01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:14.322]  I mean, this is a disaster.
[01:11:14.322 --> 01:11:14.663]  Here it is.
[01:11:16.155 --> 01:11:26.944]  Foreign policy advisors have warned that Russia is now ready to attack Ukraine, but there's still little unity among European allies about what a package of sanctions against Moscow would look like.
[01:11:26.944 --> 01:11:27.424]  If the U.S.
[01:11:27.424 --> 01:11:33.229]  and NATO aren't willing to put troops on the line to defend Ukraine, American allies can't agree on a sanctions package.
[01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:34.150]  Hasn't the U.S.
[01:11:34.150 --> 01:11:38.914]  and the West lost nearly all of its leverage over Vladimir Putin?
[01:11:38.914 --> 01:11:43.978]  And given how ineffective sanctions have been in deterring Putin in the past,
[01:11:44.478 --> 01:11:47.601]  Why should the threat of new sanctions give him pause?
[01:11:47.601 --> 01:11:55.147]  Well, because he's never seen sanctions like the ones I promised will be imposed if he moves, number one.
[01:11:55.147 --> 01:12:04.616]  Number two, we're in a situation where Vladimir Putin is about to, we've had very frank discussions, Vladimir Putin and I.
[01:12:07.076 --> 01:12:11.020]  The idea that NATO is not going to be united, I don't buy.
[01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:13.803]  I've spoken to every major NATO leader.
[01:12:13.803 --> 01:12:16.485]  We've had the NATO-Russian summit.
[01:12:16.485 --> 01:12:19.768]  We've had other, the OSCE has met, etc.
[01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:25.234]  And so I think what you're going to see is that Russia will be held accountable.
[01:12:25.854 --> 01:12:26.995]  Yeah, they'll do stuff like...
[01:12:55.410 --> 01:13:01.693]  Cut the gas pipelines out of Russia into Europe so everybody freezes to death and pays triple the prices.
[01:13:01.693 --> 01:13:04.494]  I mean, it's always the same thing with these people.
[01:13:04.494 --> 01:13:09.136]  And I'm not a Russophile, but if Russia was on our border doing this, I would be against Russia.
[01:13:09.136 --> 01:13:16.960]  And the ideologues running our country are more like the Soviet Russians than Vladimir Putin is by a long shot.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.981]  So I'm an ideological person.
[01:13:18.981 --> 01:13:22.383]  I deal with what people stand for.
[01:13:22.383 --> 01:13:22.483]  And
[01:13:23.689 --> 01:13:28.394]  If there was a country freer and better than America, I would go there.
[01:13:28.394 --> 01:13:31.598]  And rapidly, the country is becoming unfree.
[01:13:31.598 --> 01:13:34.601]  But yeah, it's that famous meme, Russia wants war.
[01:13:34.601 --> 01:13:39.246]  Look how close they put their country to our military bases.
[01:13:39.246 --> 01:13:40.468]  And if it was an evil country,
[01:13:43.359 --> 01:13:47.362]  Then I would be opposed to it, but it's not compared to what we have running our country.
[01:13:47.362 --> 01:13:49.683]  You know, here's another example of how out of his mind Biden is.
[01:13:49.683 --> 01:13:52.105]  Here he is just a few days ago at a Pennsylvania rally.
[01:13:52.105 --> 01:13:52.925]  This is real footage.
[01:13:52.925 --> 01:13:53.286]  Here it is.
[01:13:57.310 --> 01:13:58.792]  As kitchen table, I learned.
[01:13:58.792 --> 01:14:06.981]  I used to say, I used to say, Joey, nobody's better than you, but you're no better than anybody else.
[01:14:06.981 --> 01:14:08.143]  Maybe it's the scranton in me.
[01:14:08.143 --> 01:14:10.385]  I got a little bit of a chip on my shoulder.
[01:14:10.385 --> 01:14:13.268]  Worried about whether I can make next month's mortgage payment.
[01:14:13.829 --> 01:14:17.593]  Well, it is what it is because he is who he is.
[01:14:17.593 --> 01:14:19.635]  That's why it is what it is.
[01:14:19.635 --> 01:14:22.298]  He is who he is.
[01:14:22.298 --> 01:14:28.864]  You know, remember when he went on, he decided he was going to convince Bob Woodward what a smart guy he was.
[01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:31.146]  So he went on, yeah, smart guy.
[01:14:31.146 --> 01:14:37.052]  I'll lead an effective strategy to mobilize true international pressure, isolate and punish China.
[01:14:37.898 --> 01:14:41.481]  Folks, shooting and I suffered the pressure.
[01:14:41.481 --> 01:14:42.502]  All right, let's stop there.
[01:14:42.502 --> 01:14:43.623]  That's actually from the campaign trail.
[01:14:43.623 --> 01:14:45.045]  There's another similar clip I had here.
[01:14:45.045 --> 01:14:46.406]  I was in the wrong clip.
[01:14:46.406 --> 01:14:50.890]  There's so many of these, ladies and gentlemen, that it just boggles, boggles the mind.
[01:14:50.890 --> 01:14:56.816]  But this is a designed collapse of the world.
[01:14:56.816 --> 01:15:00.259]  And I go back to the fact, what are we going to do to stop it?
[01:15:00.259 --> 01:15:01.220]  It's very, very simple.
[01:15:03.496 --> 01:15:15.679]  The globalists are acting like they're about to back off the pandemic, back off the lockdowns, back off the controls, back off the vaccine passports, but they're going to do no such thing.
[01:15:15.679 --> 01:15:17.639]  They're going to act like they are, and then bring it right back.
[01:15:17.639 --> 01:15:18.919]  This is a psychological tactic.
[01:15:18.919 --> 01:15:26.801]  So let's just get aware that we pushed them back, and they always had a plan that if we pushed them back to where we were going to have a moment of unification and defeat of them, they'd back off.
[01:15:26.801 --> 01:15:28.821]  And let's just keep pushing.
[01:15:28.821 --> 01:15:30.782]  When our enemy backs off, we don't back off.
[01:15:32.372 --> 01:15:33.193]  Move forward.
[01:15:33.193 --> 01:15:49.342]  But I want to show you the disgusting Hollywood defense of Joe Biden and the destruction of this country and how that dinosaur in a red cape, as he called Trump, Tom Hanks, is out there trying to prop him up.
[01:15:49.342 --> 01:15:49.882]  Straight ahead.
[01:15:49.882 --> 01:15:50.343]  Stay with us.
[01:15:50.343 --> 01:15:51.063]  Infowars.com.
[01:15:51.063 --> 01:15:52.504]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:15:58.289 --> 01:15:58.890]  I don't know.
[01:16:12.532 --> 01:16:14.732]  The days of independent media are numbered.
[01:16:14.732 --> 01:16:18.273]  The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[01:16:18.273 --> 01:16:21.134]  They are now debanking us behind the scenes.
[01:16:21.134 --> 01:16:24.894]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[01:16:24.894 --> 01:16:30.055]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps.
[01:16:30.055 --> 01:16:33.336]  The traitors know they can shut us down by force.
[01:16:33.336 --> 01:16:36.557]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[01:16:36.557 --> 01:16:37.057]  So be it.
[01:16:38.037 --> 01:16:40.438]  Make them silence us by force.
[01:16:40.438 --> 01:16:43.439]  This is the final battle of the information war.
[01:16:43.439 --> 01:16:44.700]  Give now.
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.221]  Buy products.
[01:16:46.221 --> 01:16:47.401]  Donate.
[01:16:47.401 --> 01:16:49.242]  Before everything changes.
[01:16:49.242 --> 01:16:52.083]  We need you to carry us through to the end.
[01:16:52.083 --> 01:16:53.564]  Victory or death.
[01:16:53.564 --> 01:16:55.285]  Go now to infowarestore.com
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:04.749]  Both of these amazing products have been sold out for almost half a year because of supply chain breakdowns.
[01:17:04.749 --> 01:17:08.393]  You've done a great job supporting InfoWars and supporting your immune system.
[01:17:08.393 --> 01:17:12.799]  The problem is with all the COVID lockdowns, the Great Reset, we can't get these products in.
[01:17:12.799 --> 01:17:13.460]  So finally,
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:14.040]  I think.
[01:17:33.865 --> 01:17:34.305]  Thank you.
[01:17:57.421 --> 01:18:03.204]  Well, I'm very excited for several reasons that two of our very popular products are back in stock.
[01:18:03.204 --> 01:18:18.193]  Whole Food Multivitamin Essential Nutrient Multivitamin from Natural Healthy Sources, not synthetic, and Vitamin C and Zinc with Rosehips, the classic Linus Pauling Nobel Prize winning formula to supercharge your immune system and every cell in your body.
[01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:21.975]  They're both back in stock, sold out for more than four months at 40% off.
[01:18:24.036 --> 01:18:29.984]  Another reason I'm very, very excited about this is, this will fund our operation and keep us on air.
[01:18:29.984 --> 01:18:39.377]  So again, it's a 360 win, but whatever you do, go out and get an organic, whole food, multivitamin, Antec Vitamin C, Antec Zinc.
[01:18:39.978 --> 01:18:43.119]  We also have some great vitamin D products at InfoWareStore.com that you can eat as well.
[01:18:43.119 --> 01:18:46.641]  But whatever you do, defend your body's immune system.
[01:18:46.641 --> 01:18:49.242]  We want to keep patriots in the game against the New World Order.
[01:18:49.242 --> 01:18:50.522]  So it's a 360 win.
[01:18:50.522 --> 01:18:56.845]  Get something essential for your body and your health and your longevity and your immune system while funding the InfoWare at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:18:57.285 --> 01:19:02.150]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[01:19:02.150 --> 01:19:04.192]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[01:19:04.192 --> 01:19:09.677]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[01:19:09.677 --> 01:19:10.798]  But we failed.
[01:19:10.798 --> 01:19:12.439]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[01:19:12.439 --> 01:19:13.941]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[01:19:14.281 --> 01:19:20.305]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization Great Reset.
[01:19:20.305 --> 01:19:29.231]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:32.534]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda.
[01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:34.755]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[01:19:34.755 --> 01:19:37.097]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[01:19:37.097 --> 01:19:37.517]  We've got
[01:19:37.577 --> 01:19:42.080]  The best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at MFORSTORE.COM.
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:47.664]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[01:19:47.664 --> 01:19:54.909]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines in wait because believe me, serious times are coming.
[01:19:54.909 --> 01:19:59.632]  Get ready at MFORSTORE.COM.
[01:19:59.632 --> 01:20:05.516]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:12.554 --> 01:20:21.748]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[01:20:27.438 --> 01:20:29.518]  Thank you for joining us today.
[01:20:29.518 --> 01:20:32.339]  So, people think Alex Jones is psychic.
[01:20:32.339 --> 01:20:35.359]  People think Alex Jones predicts things.
[01:20:35.359 --> 01:20:43.581]  How does the Simpson writers continue to literally constantly mirror everything that later unfolds and happens?
[01:20:43.581 --> 01:20:51.842]  In 2007, they had a line by the Tom Hanks character about, soon the government will use me for propaganda because they have no credibility.
[01:20:51.842 --> 01:20:53.422]  Well, that really wasn't psychic.
[01:20:53.422 --> 01:20:55.083]  That's what he was already doing.
[01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:56.683]  Hollywood was already propping up
[01:20:58.988 --> 01:21:03.231]  Corporate America and D.C., and that's why they're so hated now more than ever.
[01:21:03.231 --> 01:21:08.335]  Here it is.
[01:21:08.335 --> 01:21:11.878]  Are you tired of the same old Grand Canyon?
[01:21:11.878 --> 01:21:13.079]  Here we are, kids.
[01:21:13.079 --> 01:21:14.960]  The Grand Canyon.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:16.481]  It's so old and boring.
[01:21:16.481 --> 01:21:17.662]  I want a new one.
[01:21:17.662 --> 01:21:19.644]  Now!
[01:21:19.644 --> 01:21:21.845]  Hello, I'm Tom Hanks.
[01:21:21.845 --> 01:21:22.326]  The U.S.
[01:21:22.326 --> 01:21:26.129]  government has lost its credibility, so it's borrowing some of mine.
[01:21:26.129 --> 01:21:27.550]  Tossle my hair, Mr. Hanks.
[01:21:27.984 --> 01:21:31.565]  Sure thing, son.
[01:21:31.565 --> 01:21:34.966]  Now, I'm pleased to tell you all about the new Grand Canyon.
[01:21:34.966 --> 01:21:36.046]  Coming this weekend!
[01:21:36.046 --> 01:21:38.947]  It's east of Shelbyville and south of Capital City.
[01:21:38.947 --> 01:21:40.668]  That's where Springfield is!
[01:21:40.668 --> 01:21:43.469]  It's nowhere near where anything is or ever was.
[01:21:43.469 --> 01:21:48.350]  This is Tom Hanks saying if you're going to pick a government to trust, why not this one?
[01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:49.450]  Did you see that?
[01:21:49.450 --> 01:21:51.591]  Yes, they're going to destroy Springfield!
[01:21:52.915 --> 01:21:54.737]  So they're letting you know they're playing for you, aren't they?
[01:21:54.737 --> 01:21:56.819]  It's all in your face.
[01:21:56.819 --> 01:22:00.362]  How they're going to cook up viruses and release them on you to take over and everything else.
[01:22:00.362 --> 01:22:05.928]  It's all a big sick joke because metaphysically they have to tell you what they're going to do to you before they do it.
[01:22:05.928 --> 01:22:08.310]  Well, now here it is.
[01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:09.952]  A first look at Biden's inaugural
[01:22:11.215 --> 01:22:22.203]  Brainwashing to start today and run for the next week with taxpayer money about how great everything has been with the collapse of America under Joe Biden and the Great Reset.
[01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:23.484]  Here it is.
[01:22:23.484 --> 01:22:33.531]  For there was always light, if only we're brave enough to see it, if only we're brave enough to be it.
[01:22:33.531 --> 01:22:34.792]  By the way, hit pause.
[01:22:34.792 --> 01:22:35.512]  Start this over again.
[01:22:35.512 --> 01:22:38.214]  I should point out, this has Tom Hanks in it.
[01:22:38.214 --> 01:22:38.995]  And did you hear that?
[01:22:38.995 --> 01:22:40.416]  You've got to be brave enough
[01:22:41.721 --> 01:22:48.946]  Like Psaki said, and like Paul Begala said, it's not Biden's fault or the administration's fault that there's inflation and things are falling apart.
[01:22:48.946 --> 01:22:50.387]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:22:50.387 --> 01:22:51.928]  The constituents are dumb.
[01:22:53.087 --> 01:22:56.570]  You've got to be brave enough to believe the destruction of the country is good.
[01:22:56.570 --> 01:22:59.412]  You've got to be brave enough to believe this deadly shot helps you.
[01:22:59.412 --> 01:23:03.456]  You've got to be brave enough to believe that men can compete in women's sports and are really women.
[01:23:03.456 --> 01:23:07.139]  You've got to be brave enough to have pedophile story time, drag queen story time.
[01:23:07.139 --> 01:23:09.320]  You've got to be brave enough, you understand?
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:11.943]  Brave enough to have Satan time at your local school.
[01:23:12.563 --> 01:23:14.784]  Officially sponsored by the Department of Education.
[01:23:14.784 --> 01:23:22.507]  You've got to be brave enough to have Homeland Security say that the veterans and protesting moms at PTA meetings and school boards are the bad guys.
[01:23:22.507 --> 01:23:26.529]  You've got to be brave enough because you've got to be brave enough to check your brain at the door.
[01:23:26.529 --> 01:23:28.070]  So sorry, here it is.
[01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:32.631]  For there was always light if only we're brave enough to see it.
[01:23:32.631 --> 01:23:38.174]  If only we're brave enough to be it.
[01:23:38.174 --> 01:23:38.534]  Pause again.
[01:23:39.639 --> 01:23:43.180]  You gotta be brave to stumble through the dark believing lies.
[01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:45.861]  You don't need to be brave to recognize the light.
[01:23:45.861 --> 01:23:48.782]  Listen to this upside down world they give you.
[01:23:48.782 --> 01:23:49.782]  Let's continue.
[01:23:49.782 --> 01:23:52.003]  If only we're brave enough.
[01:23:52.003 --> 01:23:56.024]  Brave enough to live through two of the most difficult years many of us can remember.
[01:23:56.024 --> 01:24:00.086]  Brave enough to pull ourselves up again and again.
[01:24:00.086 --> 01:24:02.967]  America is the home of the brave.
[01:24:02.967 --> 01:24:04.027]  It's why we keep getting up.
[01:24:04.027 --> 01:24:06.608]  No matter how many times we get knocked down.
[01:24:07.248 --> 01:24:08.709]  Like with our economy.
[01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:11.310]  It isn't all the way back, but it's getting stronger.
[01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:15.193]  We may be entering year three of a pandemic none of us wanted or expected.
[01:24:15.193 --> 01:24:15.613]  Pause again.
[01:24:16.957 --> 01:24:18.758]  These are the people that attacked you.
[01:24:18.758 --> 01:24:20.459]  These are the people murdering you.
[01:24:20.459 --> 01:24:22.580]  These are the people that lied to you on every front.
[01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:26.641]  And now it's Tom Hanks, like, I'll save you!
[01:24:26.641 --> 01:24:28.582]  Everyone hates you, Tom Hanks!
[01:24:28.582 --> 01:24:37.306]  Only LaBa— There was a study out two weeks ago, a big national study, that the more people are into celebrities, the lower their IQs and the lower their paycheck.
[01:24:37.306 --> 01:24:39.547]  You're the plague, Tom Hanks.
[01:24:39.547 --> 01:24:41.248]  We hate Hollywood.
[01:24:41.248 --> 01:24:42.789]  We hate you.
[01:24:42.789 --> 01:24:43.409]  We hate
[01:24:45.069 --> 01:24:46.690]  You're controllers.
[01:24:46.690 --> 01:24:51.652]  My God, you're disgusting!
[01:24:51.652 --> 01:24:53.132]  Honest, brave, and modest.
[01:24:53.132 --> 01:24:56.594]  Why the world can't get enough of Tom Hanks.
[01:24:56.594 --> 01:25:00.035]  Really, says the London Guardian, says the London Observer.
[01:25:00.035 --> 01:25:04.097]  How disgusting!
[01:25:04.097 --> 01:25:06.118]  Celebrity obsessed people are less intelligent.
[01:25:06.118 --> 01:25:08.439]  New study boldly claims.
[01:25:08.439 --> 01:25:11.320]  I mean, just look at those people!
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:11.420]  Ugh!
[01:25:13.665 --> 01:25:15.511]  Thank God you're not them, folks.
[01:25:15.511 --> 01:25:16.875]  Self-absorbed trash.
[01:25:16.875 --> 01:25:19.023]  Excuse me, I'm going to stop right now.
[01:25:19.023 --> 01:25:20.046]  Go back to Tom Hanks, please.
[01:25:21.531 --> 01:25:25.813]  I was the first person to get the vaccine in the whole country.
[01:25:25.813 --> 01:25:29.534]  And now, how many people are vaccinated?
[01:25:29.534 --> 01:25:30.995]  Over 200 million, right?
[01:25:30.995 --> 01:25:32.836]  That's what keeps me going.
[01:25:32.836 --> 01:25:35.237]  That I can feel the change.
[01:25:35.237 --> 01:25:36.998]  Restaurants have opened their doors.
[01:25:36.998 --> 01:25:38.818]  Shops and businesses are buzzing again.
[01:25:38.818 --> 01:25:40.439]  Oh, how nice!
[01:25:40.439 --> 01:25:42.040]  They're buzzing again!
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.801]  We let you go outside your slave pit!
[01:25:44.801 --> 01:25:46.342]  Isn't Tom Hanks nice to you?
[01:25:46.342 --> 01:25:46.742]  Continue.
[01:25:47.623 --> 01:25:52.806]  ...were created in 2021 than in any year in the last 80 years.
[01:25:52.806 --> 01:25:55.407]  We are stronger than we were a year ago today.
[01:25:55.407 --> 01:25:55.887]  Always.
[01:25:55.887 --> 01:25:58.569]  We're bringing on new drivers.
[01:25:58.569 --> 01:25:59.809]  We're expanding.
[01:25:59.809 --> 01:26:02.251]  The fear that was there, it's gone away.
[01:26:02.251 --> 01:26:03.451]  Business is booming.
[01:26:03.451 --> 01:26:05.332]  It's exciting times.
[01:26:05.332 --> 01:26:08.094]  And they get these well-meaning people to be part of it.
[01:26:08.094 --> 01:26:10.435]  So you see a real person saying, oh, he's nice.
[01:26:10.435 --> 01:26:12.936]  I'm going to badmouth about this UPS driver.
[01:26:12.936 --> 01:26:13.596]  Exactly.
[01:26:13.596 --> 01:26:16.298]  They use real people that mean well as their fronts.
[01:26:17.757 --> 01:26:23.198]  Like an angler fish has that light out there where you think it's, it's, oh what's that light?
[01:26:23.198 --> 01:26:25.059]  There's big teeth on it right there.
[01:26:25.059 --> 01:26:26.419]  Continue.
[01:26:26.419 --> 01:26:29.740]  Our roads, our transit systems, and the jobs.
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:32.281]  That's what this administration has been doing.
[01:26:32.281 --> 01:26:36.002]  From our toughest times, America has always built a brighter future.
[01:26:36.002 --> 01:26:37.682]  You know, hit pause again.
[01:26:37.682 --> 01:26:39.623]  They're destroying highways all over the U.S.
[01:26:39.623 --> 01:26:40.803]  calling them racist.
[01:26:42.247 --> 01:26:46.774]  They massively cut the budget to actually build roads and said they're bad to build windmills that don't work.
[01:26:46.774 --> 01:26:51.261]  Again, everything they say is an attack of savage hate against you and your family.
[01:26:51.261 --> 01:26:54.346]  Like a pit bull attacking all these Doberman pinchers.
[01:26:56.124 --> 01:26:58.886]  But remember, that's all... Their spirit is... Die!
[01:26:58.886 --> 01:26:59.106]  Die!
[01:26:59.106 --> 01:26:59.466]  Die!

[01:27:16.015 --> 01:27:16.255]  Die!
[01:27:16.255 --> 01:27:16.415]  Die!
[01:27:16.415 --> 01:27:16.555]  Die!
[01:27:16.555 --> 01:27:16.776]  Die!
[01:27:16.776 --> 01:27:16.876]  Die
[01:27:20.185 --> 01:27:21.186]  We are brave.
[01:27:21.186 --> 01:27:25.568]  Brave enough to see the light and be the light we need to rebuild this country.
[01:27:25.568 --> 01:27:26.288]  We're strong.
[01:27:26.288 --> 01:27:28.349]  We're courageous.
[01:27:28.349 --> 01:27:29.730]  We're resilient.
[01:27:29.730 --> 01:27:31.131]  We are America.
[01:27:31.131 --> 01:27:33.272]  Land of the brave.
[01:27:33.272 --> 01:27:36.694]  I've long said it's never been a good bet to bet against America.
[01:27:36.694 --> 01:27:39.616]  And that's more true today than ever.
[01:27:39.616 --> 01:27:42.457]  I've never been more optimistic about America's future.
[01:27:42.457 --> 01:27:45.639]  There's nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.
[01:27:47.569 --> 01:27:50.091]  What do the big universities funded by the big banks teach?
[01:27:50.091 --> 01:27:51.111]  What does the media say?
[01:27:51.111 --> 01:27:52.332]  No America's good.
[01:27:52.332 --> 01:27:52.932]  No borders.
[01:27:52.932 --> 01:27:53.813]  No walls.
[01:27:53.813 --> 01:27:54.713]  America's racist.
[01:27:54.713 --> 01:27:55.334]  It's evil.
[01:27:55.334 --> 01:27:59.356]  And then they demoralize you and then he comes with Tom Hanks and goes, you're good.
[01:27:59.356 --> 01:28:00.897]  I love you because you like me.
[01:28:00.897 --> 01:28:03.199]  You're like, OK, I want American flags.
[01:28:03.199 --> 01:28:03.939]  I want freedom.
[01:28:03.939 --> 01:28:05.280]  I'll go to you.
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:07.001]  The light on the angler fish.
[01:28:08.376 --> 01:28:15.358]  And Tom Hanks is just a selfish, hateful person that knows he's signed on to evil, that knows that he's going to be destroyed.
[01:28:15.358 --> 01:28:18.718]  And he just wants to take you with him to hell.
[01:28:18.718 --> 01:28:20.199]  That's all he wants.
[01:28:20.199 --> 01:28:23.620]  Recognize him as an enemy of you and your family.
[01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:33.382]  Recognize him as someone who wants to destroy you, and is lying to you, and that works for Klaus Schwab, along with Leonardo DiCaprio, and all of that Hollywood filth.
[01:28:34.102 --> 01:28:40.448]  And they're collapsing L.A., and they're collapsing California, and all of their garbage.
[01:28:40.448 --> 01:28:45.572]  They want to take us with them, and it's not gonna happen.
[01:28:45.572 --> 01:28:47.774]  Alright.
[01:28:47.774 --> 01:28:54.400]  When we return, ladies and gentlemen, Tucker Carlson lays out the collapse of civilization, and who's behind it?
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:54.820]  Stay with us.
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:55.761]  Look at that filth.
[01:28:58.379 --> 01:29:07.567]  Nootropics is a fancy way of saying brain pill, and it is the fastest growing market in supplements in the world, for good reason.
[01:29:07.567 --> 01:29:14.913]  There are a lot of amazing compounds out there, some healthy, some not, that do incredible things in our brains.

[01:30:57.626 --> 01:31:00.286]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[01:31:00.286 --> 01:31:05.487]  They're here all over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[01:31:05.487 --> 01:31:15.889]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, and then coming to your house and threatening, in some cases, actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[01:31:15.889 --> 01:31:24.151]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process, where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[01:31:24.471 --> 01:31:26.293]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[01:31:26.293 --> 01:31:34.081]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S.
[01:31:34.081 --> 01:31:37.444]  government military grade, at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:31:59.107 --> 01:32:02.831]  God created each and every one of us with free will.
[01:32:04.059 --> 01:32:23.614]  When we look at the world system now, openly announcing the Mark of the Beast, everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity, our very genetics, our very future over to them.
[01:32:24.415 --> 01:32:26.177]  They want control of procreation.
[01:32:26.177 --> 01:32:29.119]  They want control of the relationships between men and women.
[01:32:29.119 --> 01:32:34.884]  They want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[01:32:34.884 --> 01:32:40.429]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind and God's image and given free will.
[01:32:40.429 --> 01:32:49.957]  And make no mistake, all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special time so that you could make the right decision in free will and stand against evil.
[01:32:50.976 --> 01:32:59.782]  And then, for eternity, win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[01:32:59.782 --> 01:33:05.666]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.234 --> 01:33:19.354]  Big Brother.
[01:33:19.354 --> 01:33:21.155]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:21.155 --> 01:33:23.076]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:23.076 --> 01:33:24.757]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:24.757 --> 01:33:26.517]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:26.517 --> 01:33:33.060]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:45.585]  You know, I get really mad at the globalists for how cynical they are and how out of control they are.
[01:33:47.063 --> 01:33:56.065]  And if you just joined us, the last segment I played, a government-funded, taxpayer-paid-for, Hollywood attack job on America.
[01:33:56.065 --> 01:34:00.026]  And I got emotional and I called Tom Hanks' names and things.
[01:34:00.026 --> 01:34:06.027]  Instead, let's play it again before I get to Tucker Carlson, and let's analyze the real lies in it.
[01:34:06.027 --> 01:34:12.348]  Because I was thinking about this when I saw this this morning, and I didn't make the main point.
[01:34:13.854 --> 01:34:19.496]  And then thank God, our main producer, Scott, said, hey, you know the biggest lie in that piece during the break?
[01:34:19.496 --> 01:34:20.776]  And I said, no.
[01:34:20.776 --> 01:34:23.597]  And he said, they're the ones that tried to keep the economy closed.
[01:34:23.597 --> 01:34:25.978]  They're the ones that tried to make everybody take the shots.
[01:34:25.978 --> 01:34:27.939]  They're the ones that tried to make everybody wear the mask.
[01:34:27.939 --> 01:34:36.282]  And now they're here taking credit that everybody pushed back and said, no, that's mind control.
[01:34:36.282 --> 01:34:43.024]  And we have the highest jobless claims ever recorded in modern history since the Great Depression, and everything they say is a lie!
[01:34:46.633 --> 01:34:55.419]  But the people perish for lack of knowledge, because I talk to the average person, even people that have good jobs and have degrees and things, they don't know how stuff works.
[01:34:55.419 --> 01:35:11.469]  You know, I tell people, the family and friends, I go, hey, you know, documents came out, they produced the Wuhan virus, COVID-19, years before at the lab, and that they also sought the Pentagon authorization to release it in China, and that they described it as the exact virus as COVID-19.
[01:35:11.469 --> 01:35:13.451]  People just shake their head, they go, Alex, that can't be true.
[01:35:14.298 --> 01:35:19.342]  The hell it ain't true that thousands of documents are public!
[01:35:19.342 --> 01:35:22.204]  So, I mean, it's almost like beating a dead horse, folks.
[01:35:22.204 --> 01:35:27.827]  If you don't say no to this and you don't reject it, you're crazy.
[01:35:27.827 --> 01:35:30.469]  And the biggest thing is, quit pretending.
[01:35:30.469 --> 01:35:35.693]  It's like that woman gets it, that lawyer, that black lawyer there in New York.
[01:35:36.516 --> 01:35:39.199]  Who's been a teacher and a lawyer and worked in the system.
[01:35:39.199 --> 01:35:41.663]  And she said, the system's broken.
[01:35:41.663 --> 01:35:43.445]  It isn't for you.
[01:35:43.445 --> 01:35:45.327]  Tear it all down.
[01:35:45.327 --> 01:35:46.909]  She said, you got your government jobs.
[01:35:46.909 --> 01:35:47.810]  You got your other jobs.
[01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:51.375]  You think you're going along with this and it's giving you a future.
[01:35:51.375 --> 01:35:52.997]  It's destroying your future.
[01:35:56.561 --> 01:35:59.683]  In fact, I want to air... Oh, I'm getting so angry right now.
[01:35:59.683 --> 01:36:04.827]  Because, man, all we got to do is wake up and come together and realize we're all under attack.
[01:36:04.827 --> 01:36:12.632]  And that big banks and big universities and big media work for the worst people and they're telling us to fight over what color we are while they claim they want to stop racism.
[01:36:12.632 --> 01:36:15.234]  And they're telling us to fight over where we're from in the U.S.
[01:36:15.234 --> 01:36:23.460]  Or they're telling us to fight over who hadn't had a shot and who has when these damn people are the worst criminals the world has ever seen!
[01:36:26.391 --> 01:36:27.091]  Let's play her again.
[01:36:27.091 --> 01:36:33.513]  I played her last hour, but this is uh, Gloria, Tricia, Lindsey.
[01:36:33.513 --> 01:36:38.374]  And of course there's Antifa back there, blowing whistles, trying to keep her from being able to be heard.
[01:36:38.374 --> 01:36:44.756]  Anywhere you go to protest forced inoculations or tyranny, there's the left there, blowing their whistles so you can't be heard.
[01:36:44.756 --> 01:36:48.457]  Because they're not, they're authoritarian garbage.
[01:36:48.457 --> 01:36:50.518]  But through the whistles, you still hear her voice.
[01:36:50.518 --> 01:36:50.878]  Here it is.
[01:36:53.022 --> 01:36:53.622]  We're good to go.
[01:37:18.407 --> 01:37:19.448]  Take your children out of school.
[01:37:19.448 --> 01:37:21.149]  I'm a former educator of 24 years.
[01:37:21.149 --> 01:37:23.371]  They stopped teaching them years ago.
[01:37:23.371 --> 01:37:24.552]  You just didn't know.
[01:37:40.703 --> 01:37:45.044]  They taught them compliance.
[01:37:45.044 --> 01:37:47.945]  They stopped teaching them to think.
[01:37:47.945 --> 01:37:52.087]  Analytical thought went out the window with state exams.
[01:37:52.087 --> 01:38:00.370]  Those state exams are just being used to track your children, to determine who's going to college, to train them, to support this God-forsaken system.
[01:38:02.911 --> 01:38:11.455]  I don't care how you look at it, but if you're in corporate America, you're imprisoned by your lifestyle.
[01:38:11.455 --> 01:38:15.496]  If you're in the government, you're imprisoned by your child with good benefits.
[01:38:15.496 --> 01:38:16.497]  You understand?
[01:38:16.497 --> 01:38:19.678]  If you are on subsidy, you're imprisoned by their benefits.
[01:38:19.678 --> 01:38:25.180]  We have to get out their system, pull yourselves out, pull your dollars out, and level it!
[01:38:28.086 --> 01:38:29.247]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:29.247 --> 01:38:33.229]  I want to get that lady on the show, Tricia S. Lindsey, law firm.
[01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:35.931]  We're going to get her on ASAP.
[01:38:35.931 --> 01:38:37.572]  But she knows what she's talking about.
[01:38:37.572 --> 01:38:42.675]  When the system is trying to destroy you, you've got to pull out of it and not comply with it.
[01:38:42.675 --> 01:38:44.656]  Don't get violent with it, that's what it wants.
[01:38:44.656 --> 01:38:51.019]  Pull out of it and don't be part of it, because it's a globalist system to collapse the real system.
[01:38:51.019 --> 01:38:51.300]  All right.
[01:38:52.438 --> 01:39:05.725]  You know, I said I'd play this again, but it shows these desperate families locked up for two years, having their jobs destroyed, having their whole future destroyed, designed to make them depressed, designed to make you not have children.
[01:39:05.725 --> 01:39:15.730]  And then Tom Hanks is up there the whole time telling you how they're your saviors when they're the ones that did this to you.
[01:39:15.730 --> 01:39:16.470]  I'm not going to play it again.
[01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:17.231]  I can't watch it again.
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.621]  Tucker Carlson always does a great job.
[01:39:19.621 --> 01:39:20.641]  He did a particularly good job.
[01:39:20.641 --> 01:39:22.662]  The full video is up on Infowars.com.
[01:39:22.662 --> 01:39:26.783]  Tucker Carlson's civilization collapsing in real time thanks to Democrat policies.
[01:39:26.783 --> 01:39:28.324]  And that's important.
[01:39:28.324 --> 01:39:45.390]  But I would just add, Tucker, thanks to great reset globalist corporate policies to consolidate power, the top 10 companies and the top 20 billionaires, even the Wall Street Journal last week, increased their wealth 99% the last 22 months.
[01:39:49.485 --> 01:39:58.971]  And they're the ones funding Black Lives Matter, and they're the ones funding open borders, and they're the ones funding the UN takeover, and they're the ones at every level doing this.
[01:39:58.971 --> 01:40:05.055]  This is an assault, and their response is, if you don't know and you don't fight back, you deserve what you get.
[01:40:05.055 --> 01:40:06.256]  Now let me go ahead and throw this out here.
[01:40:08.328 --> 01:40:12.295]  Ladies and gentlemen, we won't be on air if you don't support us, and I'm not bitching at you.
[01:40:12.295 --> 01:40:15.580]  Half the time, I've kind of run my course in many ways.
[01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:20.168]  I intend to stay on air as long as possible, but everything's kind of out in the open now, but we still need to be here.
[01:40:21.479 --> 01:40:24.782]  But if we don't sell a lot of products, a lot of t-shirts, a lot of books, a lot of films, we're not going to be here.
[01:40:24.782 --> 01:40:27.344]  So, I thank you all for getting the products.
[01:40:27.344 --> 01:40:33.148]  These have been sold out for, I said four months in the ads, I cut a few days ago, but it's actually been sold out for more than six months.
[01:40:33.148 --> 01:40:39.694]  Whole Food Vitamin Mineral, not from Whole Foods, Whole Food meaning it's actually from food, it's organic, it's not synthetic.
[01:40:39.694 --> 01:40:42.015]  Whole Food Multivitamin, highest quality.
[01:40:42.015 --> 01:40:47.860]  And we also have Vitamin C and Zinc with Rosehips, the big classic, Linus Poling, 1100% of the daily allowance.
[01:40:50.971 --> 01:40:51.311]  I think so.
[01:41:10.564 --> 01:41:14.148]  X2 is the purest, best iodine we can find from deep earth crystal.
[01:41:14.148 --> 01:41:15.790]  It's not bound to other compounds.
[01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:17.792]  You get full absorption to your cells.
[01:41:17.792 --> 01:41:32.206]  It is the game changer for libido, stamina, mental clarity, your pineal gland, and of course, you can even look up, even on Wikipedia, the UN reports, and I believe it, so see the numbers, over 2 billion people have mental disabilities and cognitive disabilities because they had iodine deficiencies.
[01:41:33.131 --> 01:41:33.792]  Remember the U.S.
[01:41:33.792 --> 01:41:43.006]  government, when it finally was good for a while, I guess, in the 40s started putting it in the salt, and IQs went up on average of 15 points in the Midwest where they didn't get enough iodine from fish.
[01:41:44.645 --> 01:41:51.147]  And fertility went way up, and birth defects went way down, and then in the 80s they took it back out for whatever reason.
[01:41:51.147 --> 01:41:52.447]  But that's the crappy iodine.
[01:41:52.447 --> 01:41:53.688]  This is the good iodine.
[01:41:53.688 --> 01:41:55.688]  It's going to sell out in the next two days.
[01:41:55.688 --> 01:41:59.889]  We don't get more in for a month, but I'm keeping it discounted right now for another two days.
[01:41:59.889 --> 01:42:02.390]  X2 at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.990]  And again,
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:14.022]  Books, films, hundreds of great t-shirts, got a bunch of new long-sleeve 1776 InfoWars shirts in that look great.
[01:42:14.022 --> 01:42:21.064]  Got Let's Go Brandon shirts, got great shirts that show mice, it's original artwork saying, are you going to take the vaccine?
[01:42:21.064 --> 01:42:23.364]  They say no, I'm waiting for the human trials first.
[01:42:23.364 --> 01:42:26.245]  A lot of great new apparel at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:42:27.245 --> 01:42:32.348]  It allows us to fight on in the face of the globalists and everything we do here.
[01:42:32.348 --> 01:42:35.971]  And, you know, soon I'm going to have a heart-to-heart with the audience just about what you think I should do.
[01:42:35.971 --> 01:42:37.772]  Because that hit me during the last break.
[01:42:37.772 --> 01:42:43.476]  I said, I need to just have like a week-long discussion about what the audience wants me to do.
[01:42:43.476 --> 01:42:47.578]  And I'm going to have a poll, too, about what you want me to do in the next few weeks.
[01:42:47.578 --> 01:42:48.879]  We're going to silence that within four.
[01:42:48.879 --> 01:42:53.262]  So I got some options to stay on air and keep fighting, but I really want to know what you think.
[01:42:53.262 --> 01:42:54.363]  All right, we'll be right back.
[01:42:54.363 --> 01:42:54.683]  Stay with us.
[01:42:58.114 --> 01:43:03.875]  Well, I'm very excited for several reasons that two of our very popular products are back in stock.
[01:43:03.875 --> 01:43:18.878]  Whole Food Multivitamin Essential Nutrient Multivitamin from Natural Healthy Sources, not synthetic, and Vitamin C and Zinc with Rosehips, the classic Linus Pauling Nobel Prize winning formula to supercharge your immune system and every cell in your body.
[01:43:18.878 --> 01:43:22.659]  They're both back in stock, sold out for more than four months at 40% off.
[01:43:24.719 --> 01:43:30.668]  Another reason I'm very, very excited about this is, this will fund our operation and keep us on air.
[01:43:30.668 --> 01:43:40.042]  So again, it's a 360 win, but whatever you do, go out and get an organic, whole food, multivitamin, Antec Vitamin C, Antec Zinc.
[01:43:40.643 --> 01:43:43.805]  We also have some great vitamin D products at InfoWarsTore.com that you can use well.
[01:43:43.805 --> 01:43:47.347]  But whatever you do, defend your body's immune system.
[01:43:47.347 --> 01:43:49.948]  We want to keep patriots in the game against the New World Order.
[01:43:49.948 --> 01:43:51.209]  So it's a 360 win.
[01:43:51.209 --> 01:43:57.532]  Get something essential for your body and your health and your longevity and your immune system while funding the InfoWar at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:43:58.212 --> 01:44:09.983]  So, when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[01:44:09.983 --> 01:44:13.065]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it was
[01:44:13.926 --> 01:44:14.286]  We're good.
[01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:36.524]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[01:44:36.524 --> 01:44:38.885]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[01:44:38.885 --> 01:44:40.786]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[01:44:40.786 --> 01:44:43.007]  It literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[01:44:43.007 --> 01:44:43.768]  It's amazing.
[01:44:43.768 --> 01:44:44.268]  It works.
[01:44:44.268 --> 01:44:46.789]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[01:44:46.789 --> 01:44:53.013]  We have to break free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[01:44:53.013 --> 01:44:54.094]  Beautifully said, brother.
[01:44:54.094 --> 01:44:56.235]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[01:44:59.253 --> 01:45:06.718]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere.
[01:45:06.718 --> 01:45:13.822]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports brought by NASA and other governments and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening to the climate.
[01:45:14.591 --> 01:45:20.137]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[01:45:20.137 --> 01:45:22.900]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:29.907]  But notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s and then it's gonna be global warming and that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[01:45:29.907 --> 01:45:31.849]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[01:45:31.849 --> 01:45:33.832]  But did you know that man-made climate change
[01:45:34.632 --> 01:45:41.198]  is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN.
[01:45:41.198 --> 01:45:44.280]  They have weather control treaties from 1979.
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:47.643]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[01:45:47.643 --> 01:45:54.949]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[01:45:54.949 --> 01:45:56.731]  So yes, man-made climate change is real.
[01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:00.970]  Get our grape.
[01:46:00.970 --> 01:46:02.511]  Got a bag of it here.
[01:46:02.511 --> 01:46:05.994]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico?
[01:46:05.994 --> 01:46:07.074]  The communists!
[01:46:07.074 --> 01:46:14.419]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested, above organic, in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[01:46:14.419 --> 01:46:19.722]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune and whatever.
[01:46:19.722 --> 01:46:24.425]  The point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[01:46:24.425 --> 01:46:28.768]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[01:46:29.428 --> 01:46:35.673]  We sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound, and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[01:46:35.673 --> 01:46:40.097]  It's Wake Up America Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[01:46:40.097 --> 01:46:44.720]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you the whole story.
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:47.223]  We had like the... You wouldn't believe it.
[01:46:47.223 --> 01:46:53.608]  Anyway, so it's InfoWarsTore.com, and that's how we fund this operation, and if you don't fund us or don't want us here, that's fine.
[01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:03.481]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:03.481 --> 01:47:19.064]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:19.064 --> 01:47:22.224]  The spell is gone.
[01:47:22.224 --> 01:47:26.045]  Nobody buys into the Hollywood system or corporate media anymore.
[01:47:27.822 --> 01:47:28.682]  So what are they going to do?
[01:47:28.682 --> 01:47:33.024]  They're going to bring in tyranny and outlaw not agreeing with them.
[01:47:33.024 --> 01:47:34.865]  They're going to make us love them.
[01:47:34.865 --> 01:47:39.227]  Like we're a battered woman trying to pack our bags and get out of the house.
[01:47:39.227 --> 01:47:44.389]  Well, Nick Fuentes has been on a no-fly list for coming up on a year soon.
[01:47:44.389 --> 01:47:46.430]  And that's going to the courts right now.
[01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:51.092]  You'd know why he was on a no-fly list, but now we get a good idea.
[01:47:51.092 --> 01:47:54.873]  NBC News, Associated Press, you name it.
[01:47:54.873 --> 01:47:55.894]  The American Firster.
[01:47:57.139 --> 01:48:01.160]  Articulate, young, sharp, is a threat to the establishment.
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:13.064]  January 6th committee subpoenaed two far-right-wing activists, including Nick Fuentes, and it says he's under investigation because he took a Bitcoin donation.
[01:48:13.064 --> 01:48:17.506]  Oh my goodness!
[01:48:17.506 --> 01:48:22.667]  So, he's definitely in that 1776 club, getting persecuted.
[01:48:22.667 --> 01:48:24.268]  I appreciate him on short notice coming on.
[01:48:26.075 --> 01:48:28.375]  I've been subpoenaed by them.
[01:48:28.375 --> 01:48:32.616]  They ask questions like, give us every time you ever talked about the election.
[01:48:32.616 --> 01:48:34.117]  Impossible stuff.
[01:48:34.117 --> 01:48:38.537]  Then, you didn't give us what we wanted, just like the Sandy Hook thing.
[01:48:38.537 --> 01:48:41.358]  That's how it works.
[01:48:41.358 --> 01:48:49.179]  The weaponization of the judiciary, and now the legislative as a judiciary, acting as the executive.
[01:48:49.179 --> 01:48:51.240]  North Korea can't even
[01:48:52.213 --> 01:48:53.735]  A lot of candle to this.
[01:48:53.735 --> 01:49:01.082]  Nick Fuentes joins us in battled, banned off the internet just like us except for Infowars.com and he's got his site.
[01:49:01.082 --> 01:49:02.263]  Everybody should check it out.
[01:49:02.263 --> 01:49:03.364]  Put it on screen in a moment.
[01:49:03.364 --> 01:49:04.405]  Nick, thanks for coming on.
[01:49:04.405 --> 01:49:05.526]  Wow.
[01:49:05.526 --> 01:49:11.492]  So now you're starting to find out what a thought criminal you are even though you didn't go in the Capitol, you didn't call for breaching it.
[01:49:11.492 --> 01:49:12.373]  I saw you there.
[01:49:12.373 --> 01:49:14.976]  You weren't doing anything wrong just like us, but you're a bad person.
[01:49:16.806 --> 01:49:17.346]  That's right.
[01:49:17.346 --> 01:49:18.207]  Well, hello, Alex.
[01:49:18.207 --> 01:49:19.128]  Great to be with you.
[01:49:19.128 --> 01:49:22.490]  Yeah, and it's pretty amazing because the letter is public.
[01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:28.594]  I mean, they published the letter yesterday on Twitter, and it's republished in all the media.
[01:49:28.594 --> 01:49:37.480]  And even you read through their letter on why they're issuing this subpoena towards me, compelling me to testify, and they acknowledge in the letter there's no criminal wrongdoing.
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:40.102]  They acknowledge in the letter he's not in the Capitol.
[01:49:40.856 --> 01:49:44.237]  And like you said earlier, they go through and they list the main points.
[01:49:44.237 --> 01:49:49.218]  They said, well, he gave some speeches, he said this and that, oh, and he received some Bitcoin.
[01:49:49.218 --> 01:49:52.959]  You know, so what really is the law enforcement interest in a person like me?
[01:49:52.959 --> 01:49:57.340]  Because what, I exercised my First Amendment and received a donation?
[01:49:57.340 --> 01:49:59.901]  You know, it just goes to show what a witch hunt this is.
[01:49:59.901 --> 01:50:02.862]  They're really digging down to the bottom of the barrel here.
[01:50:02.862 --> 01:50:03.762]  You know, you go from
[01:50:04.505 --> 01:50:11.474]  They subpoena the chief of staff, and people in the administration, and everything like that, and here we are a year later, and what have they got?
[01:50:11.474 --> 01:50:18.283]  Now it's, you know, a live streamer like me, who wasn't, who they acknowledged was not even inside, compelling me to testify.
[01:50:18.283 --> 01:50:22.448]  It's just, if that's not as ridiculous as it gets, I mean, who are they going to subpoena next?
[01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:27.113]  They get a subpoena like a garbage guy who was collecting trash the next day?
[01:50:39.702 --> 01:50:43.664]  Tell us about Alex Jones's secret meeting with Trump before January 6th.
[01:50:43.664 --> 01:50:44.864]  Didn't happen.
[01:50:44.864 --> 01:50:49.266]  Tell us about, you know, the meetings where you met with Steve Bannon to plan the attack.
[01:50:49.266 --> 01:50:51.007]  Didn't, I never met with Steve Bannon.
[01:50:51.007 --> 01:50:56.690]  What I'm saying is, it's just, they don't, and even when they know it's not true, they just don't stop, Nick.
[01:50:56.690 --> 01:50:59.931]  Where do you see all this going?
[01:50:59.931 --> 01:51:03.313]  Well, what I'm concerned about is that they're building up towards
[01:51:03.982 --> 01:51:06.863]  Maybe trying to convict President Trump of something?
[01:51:06.863 --> 01:51:09.864]  I think that... Oh yeah, that's what part of the committee said yesterday.
[01:51:09.864 --> 01:51:14.706]  They said, we've talked to the Justice Department, and they're gunning and dotting for conspiracy.
[01:51:14.706 --> 01:51:17.927]  Well, for there to be a conspiracy, that means he's got cohorts.
[01:51:17.927 --> 01:51:21.268]  Well, I sure as hell know we weren't involved.
[01:51:21.268 --> 01:51:22.169]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:51:22.169 --> 01:51:26.370]  I mean, I wish we were talking to the Trump administration, but I know I wasn't.
[01:51:26.370 --> 01:51:28.711]  I wasn't in touch with any of these people.
[01:51:28.711 --> 01:51:31.612]  But ultimately, I think that's where this is headed, and I think that
[01:51:31.977 --> 01:51:44.642]  There's nothing there, but as you know, conspiracy is such a broad statute, and I think they're going through, turning over every stone, going through every person, even down to somebody like me, who clearly had no involvement.
[01:51:44.642 --> 01:51:45.822]  And like you said, they know that.
[01:51:45.822 --> 01:51:47.683]  I mean, they're spying on us.
[01:51:47.683 --> 01:51:49.364]  They surveil us.
[01:51:49.364 --> 01:51:51.824]  They probably know more about our involvement than we do.
[01:51:51.824 --> 01:51:56.766]  And so, you know, they've exonerated us before we even begin to submit documents or anything like that.
[01:51:56.766 --> 01:52:01.128]  But I think that, you know, they're trying to get all these little bits and pieces together
[01:52:01.798 --> 01:52:06.619]  And ultimately, it's leading towards trying to get Trump and preventing him from running in 24.
[01:52:06.619 --> 01:52:08.779]  I think that's the endgame of this whole thing.
[01:52:08.779 --> 01:52:10.840]  Well, I don't think that's not your opinion.
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:11.320]  That's well said.
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:12.560]  You've been saying that for months.
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:14.060]  But the head of the committee came out.
[01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:15.841]  I'm sure you saw the statement yesterday.
[01:52:15.841 --> 01:52:22.402]  He put a statement out saying, we are going to indict Trump, which totally discredits him.
[01:52:22.402 --> 01:52:31.424]  If he's this impartial investigative body that claims, you know, they're doing this for election integrity, and they're saying, we know Trump's guilty and he's suing Trump, it makes it a total fraud.
[01:52:32.915 --> 01:52:35.356]  Well, yeah, because it just shows that it's political.
[01:52:35.356 --> 01:52:40.639]  You know, they're trying to come at it with this angle that this is 9-11 and we've got to investigate.
[01:52:40.639 --> 01:52:42.761]  It's got nothing to do with an investigation.
[01:52:42.761 --> 01:52:46.423]  This is a political witch hunt and they're going after political targets.
[01:52:46.423 --> 01:52:53.307]  And you know, the thing is, and Trump said this before he left office, he said, really, they're coming for the American people and I'm just in the way.
[01:52:53.307 --> 01:52:55.728]  And the scary thing is they're not going to stop at Trump.
[01:52:56.451 --> 01:53:00.892]  They're coming for him because he's the big fish and he's the presumptive nominee if he decides to run in 24.
[01:53:00.892 --> 01:53:02.112]  Well, that's right.
[01:53:02.112 --> 01:53:06.553]  And once they get Trump, every other pro-Trump American is a co-conspirator.
[01:53:06.553 --> 01:53:09.374]  They're outlawing the Republican Party.
[01:53:09.374 --> 01:53:10.354]  That's right.
[01:53:10.354 --> 01:53:13.354]  And they're going after the base that elected Donald Trump.
[01:53:13.354 --> 01:53:18.255]  I mean, when we elected Donald Trump in 16, we repudiated the globalist establishment.
[01:53:18.255 --> 01:53:22.016]  We repudiated their rule, their consensus on liberalism and all this.
[01:53:22.615 --> 01:53:29.040]  And so they come after Trump, and now they're trying to blow up his base, which propelled him into power in the first place.
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:36.085]  And what they want is the, you know, the slave class of mask-wearers, vaxxed-up pigs, liberal media watchers.
[01:53:36.085 --> 01:53:44.490]  That's who they want to rule over and preside over instead of, like you said, the 1776 Club, freedom-loving Christian patriots.
[01:53:44.490 --> 01:53:49.434]  So the endgame is go for Trump, go for the organization, cut the snake's head off,
[01:53:49.801 --> 01:53:54.883]  And then they're going to come for everybody, and they're going to criminalize, you know, being conservative, being a patriot.
[01:53:54.883 --> 01:53:56.864]  That's where this all is headed.
[01:53:56.864 --> 01:54:04.327]  This sort of 9-11 style commission business, expansion of surveillance power, expansion of federal law enforcement jurisdiction.
[01:54:04.327 --> 01:54:13.850]  The endgame is to make it illicit and illegal to do things like, you know, what they've been doing, questioning the election integrity, questioning the efficacy of the facts, etc., etc.
[01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:16.031]  They want to criminalize anybody that defies their
[01:54:16.795 --> 01:54:17.236]  Thank you very much.
[01:54:29.383 --> 01:54:29.783]  That's right.
[01:54:29.783 --> 01:54:32.445]  We're symbols of the people that the system hates.
[01:54:32.445 --> 01:54:38.628]  And the system's hate of Nick Fointas or Alex Jones or Donald Trump is a symbol of their hatred for the general population.
[01:54:38.628 --> 01:54:40.089]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:54:40.089 --> 01:54:43.571]  They are all over the news saying we're running on terror.
[01:54:43.571 --> 01:54:45.973]  We're running on banning the Republican Party.
[01:54:45.973 --> 01:54:47.313]  Biden has been in press conferences.
[01:54:47.313 --> 01:54:51.316]  We put it on screen saying, well, there won't even be a Republican Party in a couple of years.
[01:54:51.316 --> 01:54:52.496]  We're going to outlaw it.
[01:54:52.496 --> 01:54:56.659]  And even Mitch McConnell last week said, whoa, you're calling us domestic enemies.
[01:54:56.659 --> 01:54:58.780]  I think the Democrats are biting off way
[01:55:01.662 --> 01:55:04.544]  They are, and it's already backfiring.
[01:55:04.544 --> 01:55:08.567]  I'm very skeptical of Congressional and Senate Republicans.
[01:55:08.567 --> 01:55:09.928]  I know you are too.
[01:55:09.928 --> 01:55:14.611]  And even in the Congress, even in the Senate, you're seeing some of these Republicans.
[01:55:14.611 --> 01:55:20.275]  Ted Cruz, who last week, two weeks ago, he was saying 1-6 was a terrorist attack.
[01:55:20.275 --> 01:55:21.616]  Then he's putting the screws to the FBI.
[01:55:22.580 --> 01:55:22.860]  I think so.
[01:55:42.464 --> 01:55:49.007]  You know, it's almost like... Oh, they admit a thousand government commandos watched as we tried to stop people entering the Capitol.
[01:55:49.007 --> 01:55:53.890]  The FBI and the Pentagon just sat there and watched it happen.
[01:55:53.890 --> 01:55:55.751]  Well, and that's just what they'll admit.
[01:55:55.751 --> 01:55:56.911]  That's just what they'll admit.
[01:55:56.911 --> 01:56:04.856]  But you know as well as anybody that if they're infiltrating all these groups and if they've got assets... Oh, I mean, I know how they... They probably had 50,000 troops there.
[01:56:06.701 --> 01:56:17.516]  Easily, easily, and not only did they watch and see it, but I'm sure they were instigating, I'm sure they were probably involved in planning, you know, whatever illicit activities there might have been, you know they had their hands all over it.
[01:56:17.516 --> 01:56:20.601]  Oh yeah, Ray Epps is the tip of the iceberg.
[01:56:20.601 --> 01:56:22.764]  Yes, yes, and it goes way, way deeper.
[01:56:23.268 --> 01:56:41.324]  And so, point being, you know, these Republicans, even in Congress, who I just have no expectations for them, even now they're beginning to push back, and it's slowing down this committee, it's slowing things down, and you're right, they bid off way more than they can chew, and I think 2022 is going to be a big surprise for them.
[01:56:41.324 --> 01:56:47.470]  I think it's going to be a big Republican wave, and 24, it's sort of like, to me, that's like the last shot.
[01:56:47.470 --> 01:56:48.811]  If we could get a good outcome and
[01:56:50.202 --> 01:56:51.963]  24, we can clean house, blow up.
[01:56:51.963 --> 01:56:56.226]  I agree, but they know that, Nick, so let's do five more minutes.
[01:56:56.226 --> 01:57:00.268]  Obviously, they're not going to let us have this election with 292 days left.
[01:57:00.268 --> 01:57:02.489]  I mean, they're going to pull some major crap.
[01:57:02.489 --> 01:57:08.833]  But before we go to break, because it's important for people to remember, Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Bandout Video, that's where we are.
[01:57:08.833 --> 01:57:10.273]  That's where the censored stuff's at.
[01:57:10.273 --> 01:57:12.475]  You're doing a great job as well.
[01:57:12.475 --> 01:57:14.916]  Where do people find your nightly show and then share it?
[01:57:16.448 --> 01:57:21.631]  Sure, I'm at Cozy.tv slash Nick, Monday through Friday, 8 o'clock central.
[01:57:21.631 --> 01:57:23.092]  And tell me about this Cozy.
[01:57:23.092 --> 01:57:25.073]  I've never heard of this.
[01:57:25.073 --> 01:57:27.194]  Yeah, so this is Cozy.tv.
[01:57:27.194 --> 01:57:29.796]  It's my own proprietary streaming platform.
[01:57:29.796 --> 01:57:33.558]  You know, I've been banned from everything like you, YouTube, Twitch, DLive.
[01:57:33.558 --> 01:57:34.279]  I'm banned from it all.
[01:57:34.279 --> 01:57:34.659]  Oh, I love it.
[01:57:34.659 --> 01:57:38.341]  So you were just like banned on video, but with streaming, you've launched your own thing.
[01:57:38.341 --> 01:57:39.101]  Oh, that's beautiful.
[01:57:39.101 --> 01:57:39.742]  Tell us about that.
[01:57:39.742 --> 01:57:41.423]  We'll come right back.
[01:57:41.423 --> 01:57:42.403]  Wow, that's exciting.
[01:57:42.403 --> 01:57:43.844]  That's what I want to do.
[01:57:43.844 --> 01:57:44.605]  We're very close to it.
[01:57:50.623 --> 01:57:54.264]  Inside you, like me, a fire is burning.
[01:57:54.264 --> 01:57:55.244]  Something needs to change.
[01:57:55.244 --> 01:57:59.305]  I just want to reach out and give a recommendation to Reset Wars.
[01:57:59.305 --> 01:58:00.605]  It's really powerful.
[01:58:00.605 --> 01:58:06.267]  Reset Wars was absolutely amazing and eye-opening and revolutionary.
[01:58:06.267 --> 01:58:10.668]  If you want to change your life for the better, I highly recommend this.
[01:58:10.668 --> 01:58:13.228]  Alex, thank you very much for putting the course together.
[01:58:13.228 --> 01:58:15.449]  I found it to be awesome.
[01:58:15.449 --> 01:58:16.309]  It was worth it to me.
[01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:22.671]  Have taken ancient wisdom and ancient knowledge and crystallized it with scientific knowledge.
[01:58:23.516 --> 01:58:25.017]  This isn't about Alex Jones.
[01:58:25.017 --> 01:58:37.388]  So what you're about to see is a lengthy, powerful, well-documented spectrum of information and experiences and understanding that the power structure is censoring and is deathly afraid of.
[01:58:37.388 --> 01:58:40.490]  To think the way we were intended to think by God.
[01:58:40.490 --> 01:58:42.332]  That's what this series is about.
[01:58:42.332 --> 01:58:49.258]  Reset Wars has been a great tool during this time of uncertainty and it has rejuvenated my hope.
[01:58:49.258 --> 01:58:50.459]  It's been helping me a lot.
[01:58:51.179 --> 01:58:52.920]  With a lot that's going on in my life.
[01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:58.103]  Everybody needs to purchase this product and watch it and then share the information far and wide.
[01:58:58.103 --> 01:59:00.024]  There is an awakening.
[01:59:00.024 --> 01:59:04.387]  Join in to help yourself and others to wake up.
[01:59:04.387 --> 01:59:08.829]  ResetWorks has been a great tool in both recapping what I've come to already know.
[01:59:10.030 --> 01:59:11.790]  And also learn new material.
[01:59:11.790 --> 01:59:12.871]  I'm not disappointed.
[01:59:12.871 --> 01:59:15.311]  I plan on sharing it with as many people as possible.
[01:59:15.311 --> 01:59:17.492]  I hear you coming more and more with that.
[01:59:17.492 --> 01:59:18.932]  And I feel it more and more.
[01:59:18.932 --> 01:59:20.052]  It's moving me.
[01:59:20.052 --> 01:59:23.733]  We need to have courage and focus in order to accomplish that mission.
[01:59:23.733 --> 01:59:27.034]  And I felt like I got a lot of that from Reset Wars as well.
[01:59:27.034 --> 01:59:30.675]  The confidence and hope gained from Reset Wars is priceless.
[01:59:31.255 --> 01:59:32.615]  This isn't magic.
[01:59:32.615 --> 01:59:40.277]  This is the real code of the universe, or what Max Planck 120 plus years ago called the Matrix.
[01:59:40.277 --> 01:59:51.439]  Start your journey to true freedom now at ResetWars.com.
[01:59:51.439 --> 01:59:55.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:03.416 --> 02:00:07.599]  All right, Nick Fuentes of America First is here with us.
[02:00:07.599 --> 02:00:09.921]  He's been scooped up in this whole January 6th.
[02:00:09.921 --> 02:00:12.963]  And I get our listeners are like, hey, January 6th happened a year ago.
[02:00:12.963 --> 02:00:14.604]  We know you didn't do it.
[02:00:14.604 --> 02:00:15.124]  We don't care.
[02:00:15.124 --> 02:00:25.131]  No, it's the whole deep state Democrat Party move to brand America and you as terrorists and to put you on no fly list and take your bank accounts away and come after you.
[02:00:25.131 --> 02:00:26.392]  We're trying to tell you this.
[02:00:26.392 --> 02:00:28.414]  It's not that we just tell you stuff that doesn't come true.
[02:00:28.414 --> 02:00:30.195]  Not that we just make crap up.
[02:00:30.195 --> 02:00:30.835]  We're in a war.
[02:00:31.736 --> 02:00:38.962]  So, Nick, in the next five minutes we have left, what else do you want to impart to the viewers and listeners about what's happening right now?
[02:00:38.962 --> 02:00:44.846]  Well, you know, one of the big things I've been covering on my show lately is this vaccine mandate.
[02:00:44.846 --> 02:00:48.289]  You know, I know that you've talked a lot about this stuff and, you know, it's interesting.
[02:00:48.289 --> 02:00:51.432]  I've seen a lot of Republicans talking about how, oh, you know, this
[02:00:52.321 --> 02:00:55.903]  COVID epidemic or COVID pandemic is going away.
[02:00:55.903 --> 02:00:58.805]  I've seen this from a lot of conservative Republican types.
[02:00:58.805 --> 02:01:01.206]  They go, you know, it's almost over.
[02:01:01.206 --> 02:01:03.187]  It's just this is all winding down.
[02:01:03.187 --> 02:01:09.230]  And I've been just raising the red alert on my show all day long about, you know, this vaccine mandate stuff is here to stay.
[02:01:09.230 --> 02:01:11.672]  That's one of the big things I've been covering.
[02:01:11.672 --> 02:01:14.993]  And I've also been talking a lot about this getter.
[02:01:14.993 --> 02:01:16.134]  I don't know if you've seen, but
[02:01:17.004 --> 02:01:19.446]  I think they were just on Tim Pool last night.
[02:01:19.446 --> 02:01:26.310]  I've been banned on Getter now for about a month or so, and I've been trying to get myself back on there.
[02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:26.951]  I don't think that's good.
[02:01:26.951 --> 02:01:29.893]  I think that's because they're targeting their ISPs that they have you on.
[02:01:29.893 --> 02:01:35.616]  We should get you in touch with the CEO of Getter and try to clear the air and get you on there.
[02:01:35.616 --> 02:01:38.899]  Yeah, no, that would be great, because I just saw they were on Tim Pool.
[02:01:39.895 --> 02:01:39.995]  Well,
[02:02:08.388 --> 02:02:09.608]  Everybody's done with Hollywood.
[02:02:09.608 --> 02:02:10.989]  Everybody's done with the Democrats.
[02:02:10.989 --> 02:02:12.909]  Everybody's done with the New World Order.
[02:02:12.909 --> 02:02:15.270]  And the New World Order is going to try to stay in power.
[02:02:15.270 --> 02:02:16.591]  And they're going to fail.
[02:02:16.591 --> 02:02:22.873]  And so everybody better just decide to go on the right side of history, and stop hiding in the weeds, because that's why we got here.
[02:02:22.873 --> 02:02:34.797]  Nick Fuentes, again, tell us, I love what you're doing, because I see you have a Banned Out video channel, and so I watch a lot of what you do there, but looking at this, have you launched a streaming platform?
[02:02:34.797 --> 02:02:35.837]  Not just for you, but others?
[02:02:37.443 --> 02:02:39.865]  Yes, yeah, it's called Cozy.tv.
[02:02:39.865 --> 02:02:50.253]  We're still in our beta phase, so we're trying to achieve feature parity with Twitch, DLive, you know, we're trying to get all the same features that they have on their services.
[02:02:50.253 --> 02:02:52.075]  Well, will you allow me on there?
[02:02:52.075 --> 02:02:53.236]  You won't censor me, will you?
[02:02:53.236 --> 02:02:55.558]  Of course not!
[02:02:55.558 --> 02:02:57.119]  No, I'll come work for you!
[02:02:57.119 --> 02:02:57.960]  That's my answer.
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:00.061]  So, tell me, I'm going to come work for Nick Fuentes.
[02:03:00.061 --> 02:03:03.865]  I'm being somewhat sarcastic, but I'm serious in a way.
[02:03:03.865 --> 02:03:05.346]  Tell me about this beautiful new platform.
[02:03:06.570 --> 02:03:07.531]  Yeah, you're hired!
[02:03:07.531 --> 02:03:16.299]  Well, yeah, so it's CozyTV, and yeah, the goal is to create something that's for us, you know, for patriots, for conservatives.
[02:03:16.299 --> 02:03:18.000]  You know, we love Van Dodd video.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:26.207]  I always tell my viewers to go watch my videos on my channel there, and of course, check out InfoWars, and your show, and Owen, and Harrison, and everything.
[02:03:26.207 --> 02:03:31.472]  Yeah, but the more the merrier, and the fact that you're actually launching, like, Trump's got billions of dollars with his startup.
[02:03:31.472 --> 02:03:32.653]  He can't do this, but you're doing it.
[02:03:34.190 --> 02:03:36.172]  Yeah, no, it's been pretty incredible.
[02:03:36.172 --> 02:03:40.175]  You know, we've got this developer team and it's just full of these savant kids.
[02:03:40.175 --> 02:03:44.079]  I mean like Zoomers and they built this thing really all by themselves.
[02:03:44.079 --> 02:03:50.225]  We have no investment, we've got no backers, no institutional backing, but we've just got some brilliant young kids.
[02:03:50.225 --> 02:03:57.851]  They put this thing together, I mean my age, but we put this thing together and now we have I think it's two or three dozen streamers on there.
[02:03:57.851 --> 02:03:59.533]  Last night we just broke the record I think
[02:04:00.211 --> 02:04:04.915]  I had 11,300, 11,300 live viewers.
[02:04:04.915 --> 02:04:09.479]  But we have to build it because, like you said, there's nothing out there for live streaming.
[02:04:09.479 --> 02:04:15.044]  And Trump, with all his billions, and all these other Republicans, they complain about censorship all day long.
[02:04:15.044 --> 02:04:16.265]  They do nothing about it.
[02:04:16.265 --> 02:04:16.846]  That's right.
[02:04:16.846 --> 02:04:20.429]  So cozy.tv forward slash Nick.
[02:04:20.429 --> 02:04:21.891]  I want to have an IT call you.
[02:04:21.891 --> 02:04:23.212]  I want to channel today.
[02:04:23.212 --> 02:04:24.873]  All right, Nick Fuentes.
[02:04:24.873 --> 02:04:25.494]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:26.750 --> 02:04:27.050]  All right.
[02:04:27.050 --> 02:04:27.830]  Thanks a lot, man.
[02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:28.390]  Talk to you soon.
[02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:28.870]  All right.
[02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:29.371]  Thank you.
[02:04:29.371 --> 02:04:29.711]  All right.
[02:04:29.711 --> 02:04:32.931]  I've been wanting to get him on for a month, and they got him today.
[02:04:32.931 --> 02:04:34.972]  Joel Scalz is one of the smartest guys I know.
[02:04:34.972 --> 02:04:37.472]  He's the editor-in-chief at World Affairs Brief.
[02:04:37.472 --> 02:04:47.074]  I'm going to cover the waterfront, Ukraine, Russia, the fort's inoculations, the open borders, the New World Order, January 6th, and so much more.
[02:04:47.074 --> 02:04:49.814]  You are in the crucible.
[02:04:49.814 --> 02:04:51.575]  You are in the heart of the fight.
[02:04:51.575 --> 02:04:52.075]  We'll be back.
[02:05:00.308 --> 02:05:10.496]  Whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy, we will follow the facts wherever they lead.
[02:05:13.695 --> 02:05:15.676]  The days of independent media are numbered.
[02:05:15.676 --> 02:05:19.399]  The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[02:05:19.399 --> 02:05:22.281]  They are now debanking us behind the scenes.
[02:05:22.281 --> 02:05:25.143]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[02:05:25.143 --> 02:05:31.187]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps.
[02:05:31.187 --> 02:05:34.489]  The traitors know they can shut us down by force.
[02:05:34.489 --> 02:05:37.691]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[02:05:37.691 --> 02:05:38.212]  So be it.
[02:05:39.172 --> 02:05:41.575]  Make them silence us by force.
[02:05:41.575 --> 02:05:44.578]  This is the final battle of the information war.
[02:05:44.578 --> 02:05:45.840]  Give now.
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:47.361]  Buy products.
[02:05:47.361 --> 02:05:48.543]  Donate.
[02:05:48.543 --> 02:05:50.384]  Before everything changes.
[02:05:50.384 --> 02:05:53.228]  We need you to carry us through to the end.
[02:05:53.228 --> 02:05:54.589]  Victory or death.
[02:05:54.589 --> 02:05:56.431]  Go now to infowarestore.com.
[02:06:14.938 --> 02:06:27.682]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:27.682 --> 02:06:29.363]  Well, he's an old friend of mine.
[02:06:29.363 --> 02:06:33.824]  I've been interviewing him at least 23, 24 years.
[02:06:33.824 --> 02:06:42.707]  Joel Skousen, naval aviator, means he landed on aircraft carriers in Vietnam, best-selling author, researcher, undoubtedly the top
[02:06:45.433 --> 02:06:46.894]  Secure Home Builder.
[02:06:46.894 --> 02:06:48.576]  I mean the guy's awesome.
[02:06:48.576 --> 02:06:54.100]  His uncle was a famous FBI agent that exposed the whole New World Order first.
[02:06:54.100 --> 02:07:00.486]  My first introduction to the New World Order was my grandfather having the book, The Naked Communist, and then reading it.
[02:07:00.486 --> 02:07:03.488]  So he's here with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:07:03.488 --> 02:07:05.750]  He's a political scientist by training.
[02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:06.911]  I won't do his whole bio.
[02:07:06.911 --> 02:07:09.073]  He really doesn't need that to be done.
[02:07:10.285 --> 02:07:14.327]  I was sitting there during that one minute break before he came on, and I was thinking, what's the most important thing to ask Joel Skousen?
[02:07:14.327 --> 02:07:15.087]  It's this.
[02:07:15.087 --> 02:07:17.728]  Who are the major power players in his view right now?
[02:07:17.728 --> 02:07:18.608]  How is it going?
[02:07:18.608 --> 02:07:20.449]  What's happening in Ukraine?
[02:07:20.449 --> 02:07:21.730]  What's going on with inflation?
[02:07:21.730 --> 02:07:24.351]  What's happening with Biden?
[02:07:24.351 --> 02:07:25.191]  It's all these questions.
[02:07:25.191 --> 02:07:30.593]  I mean, it's just, it's all coming to a crescendo in my view right now.
[02:07:30.593 --> 02:07:33.414]  And I'm sure he's got issues that he wants to raise as well.
[02:07:33.414 --> 02:07:36.496]  But Joel, great to have you on with us from World Affairs Brief.
[02:07:36.496 --> 02:07:39.777]  People can go there and find your great daily newsletter and all the great work you're doing.
[02:07:40.786 --> 02:07:46.108]  What do you think right now is front and center for all the people out there?
[02:07:46.108 --> 02:07:51.630]  What is central on your radar screen?
[02:07:51.630 --> 02:07:58.512]  Well, it's of course the puppet Biden regime, which is run by a whole host of globalists.
[02:07:58.512 --> 02:08:03.654]  You know, it used to be that every president had their handler.
[02:08:04.441 --> 02:08:13.867]  One person generally like Dick Cheney ran the George W. Bush administration and you know, Henry Kissinger ran the Nixon administration.
[02:08:13.867 --> 02:08:19.550]  They've all been these types of puppet presidents with a handler who was a globalist.
[02:08:19.550 --> 02:08:26.974]  But now there are multiple handlers around Biden because he's an incompetent dementia ridden puppet president.
[02:08:26.974 --> 02:08:31.137]  But they still haven't stopped the major agenda and right now the biggest story
[02:08:31.758 --> 02:08:38.001]  Coming out in Friday's World Affairs Brief is going to be the imminent attack on Ukraine by Putin.
[02:08:38.001 --> 02:08:40.742]  And that's what I'd like to address first of all.
[02:08:40.742 --> 02:08:42.984]  I agree with you.
[02:08:42.984 --> 02:08:44.404]  That's the most front and center thing.
[02:08:44.404 --> 02:08:47.266]  And you've got a great Marine Corps officer background.
[02:08:47.266 --> 02:08:49.187]  You've got a real understanding of this.
[02:08:49.187 --> 02:08:51.508]  This is huge.
[02:08:51.508 --> 02:08:52.588]  Yes, it really is.
[02:08:52.588 --> 02:08:55.710]  But as background, your listeners have to understand something that
[02:08:56.332 --> 02:09:06.338]  Only myself and Christopher Story of England, who's now deceased, have warned about, and that was that the fall of the Soviet Union was a carefully crafted deception.
[02:09:06.338 --> 02:09:08.299]  The Communist Party simply went underground.
[02:09:08.299 --> 02:09:11.381]  They gave orders for the various satellite countries to let these
[02:09:12.496 --> 02:09:24.145]  Uh... protests go forward and to take down the Berlin Wall, but they always intended to rebuild the Soviet Union after they'd gained a lot of aid and trade from the West, which has happened.
[02:09:24.145 --> 02:09:24.445]  U.S.
[02:09:24.445 --> 02:09:34.173]  oil companies, for example, rebuilt the entire Russian oil industry and made them the oil powerhouse that has funded a lot of their new weapons acquisition.
[02:09:34.173 --> 02:09:38.296]  You're saying this has been a thirty-year reconstitution?
[02:09:38.296 --> 02:09:39.857]  It has, indeed.
[02:09:39.857 --> 02:09:40.718]  And, you know, of course,
[02:09:41.698 --> 02:09:49.643]  I knew that the globalists knew what I saw, but they were supporting the phony fall of the Soviet Union because they wanted to build these enemies.
[02:09:49.643 --> 02:09:52.505]  That's why they had been allowing China through the U.S.
[02:09:52.505 --> 02:09:57.768]  Department of Commerce to steal and get access to military technology for so many years.
[02:09:57.768 --> 02:10:03.412]  They're building enemies so that they can have a third world war.
[02:10:03.412 --> 02:10:06.554]  Now, as I've explained in my World Affairs Brief,
[02:10:07.325 --> 02:10:14.871]  I do not believe that the Russian taking back of Ukraine will result in World War III.
[02:10:14.871 --> 02:10:15.812]  Only if the U.S.
[02:10:15.812 --> 02:10:24.399]  were to directly attack Russia and counter it with military force, which Biden has already said he's not going to do, it's off the table.
[02:10:24.399 --> 02:10:27.622]  Now that gives a green light to Russia to do this.
[02:10:27.622 --> 02:10:33.066]  The second green light that Biden has said, and this shocked Ukrainian officials, he said,
[02:10:33.823 --> 02:10:40.049]  You know, it wouldn't bother so much if it was just a minor incursion into Ukraine.
[02:10:40.049 --> 02:10:45.094]  Only if it was a major intervention would we be, you know, really upset.
[02:10:45.094 --> 02:10:54.864]  And Ukrainian officials were caught off guard with this remark because that to them was a green light that they could go ahead and try to take a portion of Ukraine.
[02:10:54.864 --> 02:10:56.706]  But I believe that there is evidence
[02:10:57.549 --> 02:11:00.811]  That they're setting up to take back the whole country.
[02:11:00.811 --> 02:11:09.597]  And the reason I say this is that they've got Ukraine surrounded now with troops, major troop and armored deployments on three sides now.
[02:11:09.597 --> 02:11:22.425]  It used to be just on the South with Crimea and in Eastern Ukraine, which is the Russian speaking portion of Ukraine, which Russia is claiming they indigenously want to join back with Russia.
[02:11:23.467 --> 02:11:31.350]  So they did a stealth invasion, you know, several years ago in Eastern Ukraine, weren't able to consolidate it.
[02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:33.151]  And now they're attempting to do it.
[02:11:33.151 --> 02:11:46.435]  And the reason I believe that they're going to take back the whole country is for the first time, they've got a massive amount of troops and armor stationed in Belarus directly to the north of the capital Kiev.
[02:11:46.435 --> 02:11:50.517]  And this to me indicates that with Crimean forces on the south,
[02:11:51.517 --> 02:12:02.987]  And landing ship forces heading into the Black Sea, they could run a pincers movement, meaning attack from the north in Belarus toward Kiev and from the south and actually cut off the rest of the country.
[02:12:02.987 --> 02:12:04.288]  Cut the country in two.
[02:12:04.288 --> 02:12:05.228]  That's right.
[02:12:05.228 --> 02:12:09.632]  Actually, it would cut the country one third and two thirds.
[02:12:09.632 --> 02:12:12.635]  And the one third to the west really has nothing at all.
[02:12:12.635 --> 02:12:20.281]  It's all concentrated in Kiev on east, which is what they would capture in the in the in the pincers movement.
[02:12:21.101 --> 02:12:26.383]  And so I'm very much afraid that this is the real attack that's coming.
[02:12:26.383 --> 02:12:27.044]  It's imminent.
[02:12:27.044 --> 02:12:29.705]  It probably could happen within weeks.
[02:12:29.705 --> 02:12:43.711]  Another indication that the attack is imminent, that the Russians are taking diplomats and their families out of Ukraine, especially the Kiev embassy and several other consulates.
[02:12:43.711 --> 02:12:45.892]  That's always a harbinger toward war.
[02:12:47.460 --> 02:12:57.103]  The US does have a few special forces trainers in Ukraine, but the Biden administration has already said that they would be pulled out at the initiation of hostilities.
[02:12:57.103 --> 02:13:06.986]  This is another green light to Russia to say that we won't have any troops in there to justify coming to the defense of Ukraine.
[02:13:06.986 --> 02:13:12.087]  As I've said, they would have to do if it were Korea that were under attack because we have 27,000 troops in Korea.
[02:13:15.370 --> 02:13:36.281]  While I don't think that this will be the trigger event for World War III, I think it's a similar situation to World War II when the West telegraphed to Hitler that we wouldn't be upset if you took Austria or Czechoslovakia and then put a red line down at Poland, which eventually triggered World War III.
[02:13:37.956 --> 02:13:40.018]  So it's a very serious situation.
[02:13:40.018 --> 02:13:41.059]  The U.S.
[02:13:41.059 --> 02:13:53.471]  has given some or authorized some $200 million in defensive aid to Ukraine, stating that we're going to help them stay in the battle with a much superior force.
[02:13:53.471 --> 02:13:58.155]  Well, you know, helping them stay in the battle only may prolong it.
[02:13:58.155 --> 02:14:02.059]  But let me tell you what I think the scenario militarily is in Ukraine.
[02:14:02.751 --> 02:14:07.593]  It doesn't matter if Britain is sending javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine.
[02:14:07.593 --> 02:14:09.254]  It doesn't matter if the U.S.
[02:14:09.254 --> 02:14:16.677]  is sending Stinger handheld anti-aircraft missiles through Estonia, which they're doing.
[02:14:16.677 --> 02:14:30.283]  The way that Russia is going to win this war is a massive missile barrage, first of all, at all Ukrainian military bases to neuter their radar detection, their fighter capability.
[02:14:31.341 --> 02:14:35.165]  And then they'll have air superiority over the entire country.
[02:14:35.165 --> 02:14:41.971]  And in conventional war, you can't win a war if the opposing nation has air superiority.
[02:14:41.971 --> 02:14:45.054]  They're going to knock their air force out first.
[02:14:45.054 --> 02:14:46.815]  That's right.
[02:14:46.815 --> 02:14:48.297]  So that they can roam.
[02:14:48.297 --> 02:14:56.444]  And you can't run a major tank battle when you've got the kind of air force that Russia has with its tank killer forces in there.
[02:14:57.156 --> 02:15:07.625]  And a few Stinger missiles won't help either because Russian military aircraft like our own have flares and other things to divert a Stinger missile from attacking their aircraft.
[02:15:07.625 --> 02:15:18.375]  So I think basically the war would be over within a week or two with massive Russian missile forces annihilating the military capability.
[02:15:18.375 --> 02:15:20.917]  And Ukraine doesn't have anything in order to respond.
[02:15:20.917 --> 02:15:21.397]  And the U.S.
[02:15:21.397 --> 02:15:24.400]  has said, we're not going to send offensive missiles into Ukraine.
[02:15:25.359 --> 02:15:27.561]  Because we don't want to do anything provocative.
[02:15:27.561 --> 02:15:33.685]  I mean, all of these signals you see telegraphed that the Biden administration is going to let Ukraine fall into... All right, stay there.
[02:15:33.685 --> 02:15:34.445]  We've got to go to break.
[02:15:34.445 --> 02:15:37.347]  joelskousen.com, worldoffirstbrief.com.
[02:15:37.347 --> 02:15:40.709]  We'll come back and talk about how historic this is and how dangerous this is.
[02:15:40.709 --> 02:15:46.193]  We sell his book, the Strategic Relocation DVD and book special at mfallwarstore.com.
[02:15:46.193 --> 02:15:47.754]  Get that, more important than ever.

[02:15:58.183 --> 02:16:04.109]  Well, here we are in the year 2022, and InfoWars is now more important than it's ever been.

[02:16:58.090 --> 02:17:02.333]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games.
[02:17:02.333 --> 02:17:03.674]  I like going to concerts.
[02:17:03.674 --> 02:17:05.035]  I like going to play golf.
[02:17:05.035 --> 02:17:06.616]  I like going out to dinner.
[02:17:06.616 --> 02:17:08.777]  I like the metropolitan life.
[02:17:08.777 --> 02:17:10.798]  I like everything that comes with this.
[02:17:10.798 --> 02:17:13.280]  But see, I have the survival instinct.
[02:17:13.740 --> 02:17:16.843]  That is to get the hell out of Democrat-run cities.
[02:17:16.843 --> 02:17:19.606]  Get the hell out of major metropolitan areas.
[02:17:19.606 --> 02:17:23.110]  Because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[02:17:23.110 --> 02:17:24.932]  Is it time to just move out to the woods?
[02:17:24.932 --> 02:17:27.054]  Just time to go get a piece of property in the woods?
[02:17:27.054 --> 02:17:27.995]  Just get off-grid?
[02:17:27.995 --> 02:17:29.456]  Just get the emergency food supplies?
[02:17:29.456 --> 02:17:30.578]  Just live off the land?
[02:17:30.578 --> 02:17:31.959]  That's the survival instinct.
[02:17:31.959 --> 02:17:36.244]  But see, the worldly part of me, that's still probably the majority part of me, says no, no, no, no, no.
[02:17:36.824 --> 02:17:37.744]  Stay in the city.
[02:17:37.744 --> 02:17:42.746]  The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere they've ever notioned that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[02:17:42.746 --> 02:17:49.209]  That's the, that's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[02:17:49.209 --> 02:17:59.973]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies and so we have the best ones at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:17:59.973 --> 02:18:00.914]  This is a great sponsor.

[02:18:41.126 --> 02:18:42.286]  Works like a regular cell phone.

[02:18:43.587 --> 02:18:44.887]  And I keep one in my car.
[02:18:44.887 --> 02:18:46.728]  I've given them to my parents as gifts.
[02:18:46.728 --> 02:18:49.129]  Way out in the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work.
[02:18:49.129 --> 02:18:49.949]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1020.
[02:18:49.949 --> 02:18:51.210]  941-955-1020 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[02:18:57.890 --> 02:19:14.140]  In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[02:19:14.140 --> 02:19:17.802]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[02:19:17.802 --> 02:19:24.506]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[02:19:25.106 --> 02:19:29.188]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now.
[02:19:29.188 --> 02:19:31.929]  We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.

[02:19:35.971 --> 02:19:43.335]  Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[02:19:43.335 --> 02:19:47.257]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the info war.
[02:19:47.637 --> 02:19:50.420]  And we're back live with Joel Skelton of World Affairs Brief.
[02:20:17.483 --> 02:20:29.626]  We're talking about what's happening right now with this historic admission by the White House and others that Russia is imminently about to invade.
[02:20:29.626 --> 02:20:33.887]  Troops on three sides of the country.
[02:20:33.887 --> 02:20:35.228]  And I agree.
[02:20:35.228 --> 02:20:36.368]  I think that's what's about to happen.
[02:20:36.368 --> 02:20:38.448]  Putin says, oh, that's not about to happen.
[02:20:38.448 --> 02:20:40.109]  And then we have Jen Psaki.
[02:20:41.477 --> 02:20:47.159]  And General Keene and all over TV saying, false flags are imminent.
[02:20:47.159 --> 02:20:50.741]  Well, I thought false flags didn't exist, Joel Skousen.
[02:20:50.741 --> 02:20:52.842]  So how does all this feed into it?
[02:20:52.842 --> 02:21:08.068]  Do you think Russia will stage a false flag to go in, A, and then B, more importantly, is this the Anglo-American establishment luring the Russians in to a project like you foretold that would be like the start of World War II?
[02:21:08.068 --> 02:21:08.688]  Is that what's happening?
[02:21:10.620 --> 02:21:14.062]  Well, there's several questions involved in what you said.
[02:21:14.062 --> 02:21:23.586]  First of all, let me dispose of the notion that this is the West luring Russia into an excuse to start World War III.
[02:21:23.586 --> 02:21:29.889]  I have to counter oftentimes conservatives who talk about the U.S.
[02:21:29.889 --> 02:21:37.013]  involvement in the globalist, in the Maidan Revolution, which was the color revolution, which basically
[02:21:38.142 --> 02:21:44.647]  Supposedly ousted the Russians from control over Ukraine in 2014, February.
[02:21:44.647 --> 02:21:45.948]  But this isn't true at all.
[02:21:45.948 --> 02:21:53.573]  In fact, this was a false orange revolution, just like it was the false phony demise of the Soviet Union.
[02:21:53.573 --> 02:22:05.162]  Because, and we know this, because the only reason the Maidan, the Maidan refers to the main square in Kiev where the protests were taking place, and of course the West was giving some support to the protesters.
[02:22:05.162 --> 02:22:06.683]  But the key to this,
[02:22:07.461 --> 02:22:20.045]  Is that the only reason that the protesters won was because the Berkut, the riot police who were surrounding all the protesters, someone told them to stay in their barracks on the Friday that the protesters won.
[02:22:20.045 --> 02:22:24.906]  Now, could the protesters have told the Berkut to stay in their barracks?
[02:22:24.906 --> 02:22:29.168]  Could the Western globalists have told the Berkut to stay in their barracks?
[02:22:29.168 --> 02:22:30.068]  No, not at all.
[02:22:30.068 --> 02:22:34.009]  Only the communist government could have told the Berkut to stay in their barracks.
[02:22:34.884 --> 02:22:45.588]  I mean, this is a crucial piece of information that I put out in the World Affairs Brief, and yet it doesn't get circulated wide enough, and people continue to spread the information that the West is provoking this.
[02:22:45.588 --> 02:22:47.609]  Sure, so that'd be a false flag of its own.
[02:22:47.609 --> 02:22:50.270]  So let me make it more simple, Joel, because I respect your opinion.
[02:22:50.270 --> 02:22:51.271]  What is really going on?
[02:22:51.271 --> 02:22:53.652]  Just boil it down for us.
[02:22:53.652 --> 02:23:03.816]  Well, the point is, is that Timoshenko and Poroshenko and other, you know, so-called pro-independence nationalist Ukrainian presidents
[02:23:04.298 --> 02:23:08.499]  We're in fact Russian puppets, just like we have globalist puppets in our country.
[02:23:08.499 --> 02:23:12.761]  The Russians play this game just as well as our own globalists do.
[02:23:12.761 --> 02:23:20.283]  But then again, you know, a couple of years ago, President Zelensky was elected.
[02:23:20.283 --> 02:23:22.504]  And he is not a Russian puppet.
[02:23:22.504 --> 02:23:23.404]  He's legitimate.
[02:23:23.404 --> 02:23:24.784]  He's a legitimate nationalist.
[02:23:24.784 --> 02:23:29.126]  And that's one of the reasons why Putin has to take back Ukraine now.
[02:23:29.126 --> 02:23:31.446]  Because they don't have a puppet president in there.
[02:23:31.446 --> 02:23:33.207]  He's really trying to help the country.
[02:23:33.991 --> 02:23:49.924]  But the globalists, if anything, are letting it happen, not because they are provoking it, but because, like in Kuwait, they basically gave the green light to Saddam Hussein to invade Korea, so that it would be an excuse, you know, to do the Iraq War.
[02:23:49.924 --> 02:23:57.050]  But that wasn't World War III, and this won't be World War III, in my opinion, because Russia isn't ready.
[02:23:57.050 --> 02:24:02.215]  But Russia does want to have an excuse to invade Ukraine, and so
[02:24:02.828 --> 02:24:06.131]  I believe it was legitimate that they were planting a false flag.
[02:24:06.131 --> 02:24:10.934]  And of course the U.S., that's like the kettle calling the pot black.
[02:24:10.934 --> 02:24:11.535]  The U.S.
[02:24:11.535 --> 02:24:15.178]  is the prime instigator of false flag operations.
[02:24:15.178 --> 02:24:21.203]  They've been doing it for a year, ever since the Spanish-American War, the blowing up of the battleship Maine, which was done by U.S.
[02:24:21.203 --> 02:24:21.583]  operatives.
[02:24:22.996 --> 02:24:25.958]  The Pearl Harbor, of course, was provoked.
[02:24:25.958 --> 02:24:28.779]  World War I was provoked.
[02:24:28.779 --> 02:24:32.140]  The Vietnam War, the Gulf of Tonkin incident was falsified.
[02:24:32.140 --> 02:24:37.383]  9-11 started the War on Terror, was a deep state operation from beginning to end.
[02:24:37.383 --> 02:24:40.424]  So we are the champions of false flags.
[02:24:40.424 --> 02:24:42.765]  Now, the Russians have used them before, too.
[02:24:42.765 --> 02:24:47.107]  There were four bombings of apartments in four Russian cities, including Moscow.
[02:24:49.716 --> 02:24:50.196]  I don't think so.
[02:25:00.501 --> 02:25:03.303]  They are understanding and they watch what the U.S.
[02:25:03.303 --> 02:25:12.971]  has done and they try to expose some of the globalist things like in Syria, you know, our deep state is one that created Al Qaeda, we created ISIS.
[02:25:12.971 --> 02:25:20.137]  Well then why is Russia, I'm not defending Russia, but why is Russia promoting more children and not having men be wimps?
[02:25:20.137 --> 02:25:24.540]  Xi Jinping is saying three children, no sissy men on TV.
[02:25:24.540 --> 02:25:27.863]  I mean, I think they just know the poison of the left is for us, not for them.
[02:25:28.922 --> 02:25:30.123]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:25:30.123 --> 02:25:33.165]  It's true.
[02:25:33.165 --> 02:25:41.892]  So in any case, the main thing I want to talk about, though, is in the newest thing coming up is even being promoted by Russia.
[02:25:41.892 --> 02:25:53.822]  And this is the specter of missiles coming back into the Americas by Russia, hinting that if you try to intervene or stop us, that you're going to have a nuclear war.
[02:25:53.822 --> 02:25:57.625]  Now, the New York Times started this talking about secret
[02:25:59.306 --> 02:25:59.566]  That's right.
[02:26:19.985 --> 02:26:23.708]  The secret missiles mission to Cuba, the fact that the U.S.
[02:26:23.708 --> 02:26:31.434]  now is running overflights in Cuba and Venezuela trying to see if they've installed any of these missiles in these two countries.
[02:26:31.434 --> 02:26:41.202]  They also talked about, told the story about a Bore class missile submarine surfacing off the U.S.
[02:26:41.202 --> 02:26:44.184]  coast to show itself kind of as a threat.
[02:26:44.184 --> 02:26:47.807]  This is what we can nuke you, you know, if you intervene with us in Russia.
[02:26:48.410 --> 02:26:57.375]  Well, we've always known about this retaliatory threat of Russian missile submarines, but it really isn't anything new that Russian submarines are off our coast.
[02:26:57.375 --> 02:27:05.600]  The fact that Pravda didn't even mention which coast it was indicates that this was for propaganda purposes, kind of a hollow threat.
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:14.865]  But I can tell you that this missile threat in the Americas is not aimed at the Ukraine deterrence or deterring the U.S.
[02:27:14.865 --> 02:27:15.906]  from intervening, but it's
[02:27:17.017 --> 02:27:28.026]  Kind of a warning shot that this is what we intend to do before we launch on America in World War III, which has to start with a larger provocation than Ukraine.
[02:27:28.026 --> 02:27:32.469]  So I think the Russians are intending to put missiles back into Venezuela and Cuba.
[02:27:32.469 --> 02:27:35.291]  In fact, they may have already done so.
[02:27:35.291 --> 02:27:41.276]  You know, we never did inspect Cuba in the resolution of the so-called missile crisis.
[02:27:41.276 --> 02:27:43.918]  We never did inspect the ships, which
[02:27:44.597 --> 02:27:48.298]  Supposedly had the missiles on them taking them out, but they were all covered with tarps.
[02:27:48.298 --> 02:27:50.980]  So we don't know if they really took them out or not.
[02:27:50.980 --> 02:28:01.984]  In fact, people don't realize that we lost big in the Cuban missile crisis because Kennedy secretly agreed with Khrushchev to remove all of our intermediate range missiles out of Turkey.
[02:28:02.637 --> 02:28:11.899]  So we actually did remove any threat to Russia out of our Turkey missiles, but we never were allowed to inspect Cuba to see whether or not they actually removed missiles.
[02:28:11.899 --> 02:28:12.980]  Well, let's talk about this.
[02:28:12.980 --> 02:28:20.902]  I want to have time to talk about the Jan 6th Committee and the open borders, the devaluation and the inflation, but let's finish up when we come back in this segment.
[02:28:21.762 --> 02:28:25.504]  On how does the Russian invasion of Ukraine look?
[02:28:25.504 --> 02:28:28.726]  And is the White House telling the truth that it's imminent?
[02:28:28.726 --> 02:28:32.427]  With Joel Skousen of worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:28:32.427 --> 02:28:34.989]  You can email him there and get a free copy of their newsletter.
[02:28:34.989 --> 02:28:35.969]  It's excellent.
[02:28:35.969 --> 02:28:39.771]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com and newswars.com.
[02:28:39.771 --> 02:28:41.452]  We'll be right back on the other side of this break.
[02:28:41.452 --> 02:28:45.834]  Please remember, the only way our articles and videos and live feeds get out is when you share them.
[02:28:46.494 --> 02:28:48.215]  You are the resistance.
[02:28:48.215 --> 02:28:51.238]  You are the victory when you decide to take action.
[02:28:51.238 --> 02:28:53.820]  So share the articles and videos from InfoWars.com.
[02:28:57.871 --> 02:29:04.794]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[02:29:04.794 --> 02:29:10.676]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[02:29:10.676 --> 02:29:17.018]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[02:29:17.358 --> 02:29:24.585]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[02:29:24.585 --> 02:29:34.854]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[02:29:35.274 --> 02:29:44.279]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[02:29:44.279 --> 02:29:50.903]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[02:29:50.903 --> 02:29:57.067]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[02:29:57.307 --> 02:30:02.151]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[02:30:02.151 --> 02:30:04.213]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[02:30:04.213 --> 02:30:09.438]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them in their tracks before they went operational.
[02:30:09.438 --> 02:30:10.559]  But we failed.
[02:30:10.559 --> 02:30:12.200]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[02:30:12.200 --> 02:30:13.702]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[02:30:14.062 --> 02:30:20.066]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization Great Reset.
[02:30:20.066 --> 02:30:28.992]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[02:30:28.992 --> 02:30:34.515]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[02:30:34.515 --> 02:30:37.097]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[02:30:37.097 --> 02:30:39.899]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices.
[02:30:40.279 --> 02:30:45.380]  Both of these amazing products have been sold out for almost half a year because of supply chain breakdowns.
[02:30:45.380 --> 02:30:48.221]  You've done a great job supporting InfoWars and supporting your immune system.
[02:31:07.785 --> 02:31:12.186]  The problem is, with all the COVID lockdowns and the Great Reset, we can't get these products in.
[02:31:12.186 --> 02:31:19.548]  So finally, they came in, but a limited run, of our whole food, vitamin, mineral, essential, nutrient.
[02:31:19.548 --> 02:31:24.189]  Multivitamins, so you absorb it, and so it's not toxic in your body, like synthetic vitamins.
[02:31:24.189 --> 02:31:26.289]  Then of course, vitamin C and zinc.
[02:31:26.289 --> 02:31:32.791]  This sucker is really full and heavy, because it's a huge dose of vitamin C and zinc and rose hips.
[02:31:33.371 --> 02:31:36.872]  Number one thing you can do for your immune system and your body, and it does so much more.
[02:31:36.872 --> 02:31:41.694]  Both of these are now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com for 40% off.
[02:31:41.694 --> 02:31:44.615]  I'm going to keep them at that price until they sell out.
[02:31:44.615 --> 02:31:47.016]  Because of supply chain breakdowns, we've got a limited run.
[02:31:47.016 --> 02:31:50.918]  So please take action now and order them at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:50.918 --> 02:31:56.020]  But whatever you do, find similar products out there and use them because this is a life and death situation to be healthy.
[02:31:56.789 --> 02:32:00.634]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[02:32:00.634 --> 02:32:04.959]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[02:32:04.959 --> 02:32:13.489]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:13.809 --> 02:32:30.419]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[02:32:30.419 --> 02:32:41.466]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[02:32:41.946 --> 02:32:50.432]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[02:32:50.432 --> 02:32:59.038]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:59.038 --> 02:33:04.902]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:11.684 --> 02:33:16.588]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:16.588 --> 02:33:18.970]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:18.970 --> 02:33:21.712]  And I want to shift to that in a moment.
[02:33:21.712 --> 02:33:25.935]  Mitch McConnell last week said, whoa, what is Biden doing?
[02:33:25.935 --> 02:33:32.460]  The puppet creature saying, oh, my opposition are domestic enemies.
[02:33:32.460 --> 02:33:33.341]  They're terrorists.
[02:33:33.341 --> 02:33:35.462]  And that made the official move of January 6th.
[02:33:35.462 --> 02:33:37.884]  I want to talk to Joel Scalise of the World Affairs Brief about that.
[02:33:37.884 --> 02:33:40.126]  But Joel, in the short term,
[02:33:41.397 --> 02:33:47.420]  They're saying all over the Western news, usually that's a lie, but you're saying you think it's probably true.
[02:33:47.420 --> 02:33:51.503]  Why would Russia mass all these troops all the way around Ukraine's borders?
[02:33:51.503 --> 02:33:53.204]  That there's an imminent attack.
[02:33:53.204 --> 02:33:54.845]  What do you expect to come from that?
[02:33:54.845 --> 02:33:58.747]  And then what's the next confrontation that's basically born out of that?
[02:34:01.263 --> 02:34:07.527]  Let me just correct the instructions on how people get a sample of the World Affairs Brief before I answer that Alex.
[02:34:07.527 --> 02:34:13.331]  I no longer have people email me because I just get blitzed with emails and I don't have the time to answer them all.
[02:34:13.331 --> 02:34:22.877]  So now if people go to worldaffairsbrief.com and on the left hand side in red just click on request a sample and you get the current copy of the World Affairs Brief.
[02:34:22.877 --> 02:34:23.397]  That's easier.
[02:34:23.397 --> 02:34:24.598]  So go there and click the red link.
[02:34:24.598 --> 02:34:25.699]  All right.
[02:34:25.699 --> 02:34:27.900]  You've got a big one coming out tomorrow.
[02:34:27.900 --> 02:34:29.881]  So please continue.
[02:34:29.881 --> 02:34:30.262]  That's right.
[02:34:32.561 --> 02:34:41.070]  In the big picture, I think it is time for Ukraine to be taken back as the Soviet Union is going to be reconstituted.
[02:34:41.070 --> 02:34:49.177]  It's amazing how I read certain pundits in the West talking about, oh, this is a conspiracy theory that Putin is trying to reestablish the Soviet Union.
[02:34:49.177 --> 02:34:50.799]  Well, he really is.
[02:34:50.799 --> 02:34:51.860]  It's no conspiracy.
[02:34:51.860 --> 02:34:53.481]  You're going to see it enacted out.
[02:34:53.481 --> 02:34:55.864]  As I say, it's going to be a blitzkrieg type war.
[02:34:56.599 --> 02:35:06.048]  It's going to be softening up with massive missile attacks on all of the Ukraine bases and clearing the skies so that the Russians can have dominance.
[02:35:06.048 --> 02:35:11.873]  And I think we'll see Ukrainian forces collapse within a couple of weeks when this happens.
[02:35:11.873 --> 02:35:17.278]  But in the larger big picture, I think there's a real possibility this could be a one-two punch.
[02:35:17.278 --> 02:35:19.120]  In other words, Russia
[02:35:19.955 --> 02:35:24.640]  Being an ally of China can coordinate two attacks to ensure that the U.S.
[02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:25.922]  doesn't have the facility.
[02:35:25.922 --> 02:35:27.503]  Well, that's exactly how you do it.
[02:35:27.503 --> 02:35:36.873]  You go into Hong Kong or Taiwan or other areas, the Philippines or into Vietnam at the same time the Russians go into Eastern Europe.
[02:35:36.873 --> 02:35:37.414]  That's right.
[02:35:37.414 --> 02:35:41.859]  And I'm expecting the Chinese to go in and take Taiwan after the Winter Olympics.
[02:35:42.763 --> 02:35:45.585]  And they are going to be ruthless.
[02:35:45.585 --> 02:35:48.147]  It's going to have a major shock effect on the U.S.
[02:35:48.147 --> 02:35:56.513]  economy because of all of the chip manufacturing, which is already down and restricting auto supply and appliances, etc.
[02:35:56.513 --> 02:36:09.702]  But when Taiwan is taken by China, we're going to lose over three fourths of the chip manufacturing in the country, as well as a lot of other high tech manufacturing that comes out of Taiwan to U.S.
[02:36:09.702 --> 02:36:10.062]  products.
[02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:16.583]  You know, it's a real mistake for us to have allowed China to become such a mammoth supplier of U.S.
[02:36:16.583 --> 02:36:16.843]  things.
[02:36:16.843 --> 02:36:21.786]  You know, Walmart claims that 60% of our goods are U.S.
[02:36:21.786 --> 02:36:22.146]  made.
[02:36:22.146 --> 02:36:33.753]  Well, I went and did an informal survey in Walmart, and I couldn't find a single product that wasn't made in China, except on the vitamin shelf and some of the cosmetics.
[02:36:33.753 --> 02:36:38.796]  So you're saying there's been a major double-crossing of the so-called American elite by China?
[02:36:41.092 --> 02:36:46.796]  Or just by their own action, they've sold themselves out, being so dependent on China.
[02:36:46.796 --> 02:36:48.137]  Well, that's right.
[02:36:48.137 --> 02:36:59.205]  You know, they realize that that's how you build up a huge enemy who's capable of taking on the West, is by giving them all of this income from U.S.
[02:36:59.205 --> 02:37:00.506]  economic support.
[02:37:01.215 --> 02:37:09.021]  And that's one of the reasons why, when China and Russia do their massive nuclear first strike, it will be only on U.S.
[02:37:09.021 --> 02:37:09.922]  military targets.
[02:37:09.922 --> 02:37:17.488]  They do not want to destroy the economic infrastructure which provides so much of the material wealth.
[02:37:17.488 --> 02:37:22.693]  And what you're saying I agree with, they've already got the blue cities and their little commie people in charge of those.
[02:37:22.693 --> 02:37:23.934]  They're just going to cut out the U.S.
[02:37:23.934 --> 02:37:24.334]  military.
[02:37:25.908 --> 02:37:34.150]  Well, in fact, it isn't that they control the blue side of the... No, but they know the blue side will capitulate and go along.
[02:37:34.150 --> 02:37:42.492]  But only because the globalists control the blue side, and the globalists want China, you see, to be prepared for war.
[02:37:42.492 --> 02:37:43.572]  They want China.
[02:37:43.572 --> 02:37:46.293]  They want to mask the United States people from the threat.
[02:37:46.293 --> 02:37:54.655]  Now, even though certain generals on our side, like General Mike Flynn, are talking about China being a major threat, it's amazing to me how Mike Flynn
[02:37:55.273 --> 02:38:01.414]  has believed all the propaganda from the National War College that Russia is no longer a threat, that it's a dying country.
[02:38:01.414 --> 02:38:05.515]  He said that on Tucker Carlson just the other week.
[02:38:05.515 --> 02:38:16.358]  And it's a very misinformed position, and it shows how much propaganda our generals are getting from the National War College, which are all taught by globalists out of Georgetown, etc.
[02:38:16.358 --> 02:38:18.018]  They do not believe that Russia is a threat.
[02:38:18.018 --> 02:38:20.418]  So when do you think Russia already has troops in Ukraine?
[02:38:20.418 --> 02:38:22.279]  When do you think the main thing kicks off?
[02:38:22.279 --> 02:38:22.999]  How long does it last?
[02:38:24.750 --> 02:38:40.542]  As I say, I think it's only going to last a couple of weeks because I think the Russian has overwhelming superiority electronically in missile forces to be able to undermine the armored forces, which are basically second rate in Ukraine.
[02:38:40.542 --> 02:38:42.523]  They don't have the latest armor that Russia has.
[02:38:42.523 --> 02:38:44.965]  Yeah, so being in the Ukrainian military is going to be a death trap.
[02:38:46.869 --> 02:39:03.803]  Yeah, and there's not a lot of fervor in the Ukrainian military towards defending the country, because it's a very torn country between Russian-speaking people and Ukrainian-speaking people, which they're mostly bilingual, except in eastern Ukraine.
[02:39:03.803 --> 02:39:14.592]  But we had a lot of defections during the Donbass stealth invasion by Russia, a lot of defections over to the Russian side, and I think that that may happen again.
[02:39:15.472 --> 02:39:23.058]  All right, shifting gears domestically, Biden trying to say election fraud, clearly want to steal the next election again.
[02:39:23.058 --> 02:39:27.581]  Trump, to me, just seems to be going around in circles, seems to be out of the game.
[02:39:27.581 --> 02:39:32.464]  What do you think about America's politics and America's position right now?
[02:39:32.464 --> 02:39:35.347]  Well, first of all, I agree with the position you've taken that
[02:39:36.829 --> 02:39:40.730]  We really can't afford to support Donald Trump again for the presidency.
[02:39:40.730 --> 02:39:45.332]  We need someone who will really follow through rather than just give us the rhetoric.
[02:39:45.332 --> 02:40:00.858]  Now, I'm not impugning Donald Trump's desire to make America great again, but he virtually has no power intellectually or morally to follow through and fight the actual battle it takes to fight the globalists.
[02:40:00.858 --> 02:40:03.919]  He still cannot tell who's a globalist and who isn't.
[02:40:03.919 --> 02:40:06.220]  He continues to make mistakes about that.
[02:40:06.840 --> 02:40:17.065]  He even went out and criticized Ron DeSantis of Florida, who has shown himself very strong against this COVID nonsense and this vaccine nonsense.
[02:40:17.065 --> 02:40:22.327]  Donald Trump is incapable of saying, I'm sorry, I was wrong about the vaccines.
[02:40:22.327 --> 02:40:23.888]  And he continues to push those.
[02:40:23.888 --> 02:40:26.769]  So I think you're right about that.
[02:40:26.769 --> 02:40:30.431]  I think we need to find some additional support.
[02:40:30.431 --> 02:40:35.033]  Unfortunately, he's a force to be reckoned with because
[02:40:35.737 --> 02:40:46.241]  His supporters are so fanatical in their support of Donald Trump that they just won't countenance anyone else as long as he's in the battle.
[02:40:46.241 --> 02:40:54.004]  So I fear he will be the nominee in 2024 and that Hillary Clinton is going to be the Democratic nominee.
[02:40:54.004 --> 02:41:00.566]  The Democrats are in real trouble because of their woke politics, their unpopularity.
[02:41:00.566 --> 02:41:02.767]  I think the true Democratics are support.
[02:41:03.482 --> 02:41:10.849]  For Joe Biden is about 30%, which isn't enough to get elected, even with a lot of election fraud.
[02:41:10.849 --> 02:41:23.080]  But that's why the Democrats are trying so hard to push H.R.1 and H.R.4 in the Senate, both of which have to do with federalizing federal election laws and stopping and overturning the state's attempts to tighten up
[02:41:23.786 --> 02:41:35.979]  Now I can tell you that the state's attempt to tighten up voter registration and fraud and other things is really not going to work as long as you allow complete 100% computer voting.
[02:41:35.979 --> 02:41:41.045]  In the United States, it's capable of having election electronic fraud, whether it's
[02:41:45.438 --> 02:41:47.459]  It doesn't matter who owns the voting machines.
[02:41:47.459 --> 02:41:53.661]  The globalists, I think, control whoever's going to run these voting machines and there will be fraudulent elections.
[02:41:53.661 --> 02:42:01.544]  We'll tell in the 2022 elections how much fraud there still is, but I think there's going to be a lot.
[02:42:01.544 --> 02:42:10.208]  I still think the Democrats are in danger of losing the House because of how much damage Biden has done to this.
[02:42:12.071 --> 02:42:14.934]  It's going to be very telling to see how much election fraud.
[02:42:14.934 --> 02:42:17.236]  The Democrats are going to be much more careful about this.
[02:42:17.236 --> 02:42:24.142]  They made a lot of mistakes and had to really cover it up with the media in denial that there was any fraud.
[02:42:24.142 --> 02:42:24.522]  That's right.
[02:42:24.522 --> 02:42:28.045]  There was a desperate sloppiness.
[02:42:28.045 --> 02:42:30.167]  There was a great deal of sloppiness.
[02:42:31.141 --> 02:42:39.886]  But I'm very, very disappointed in how the media, especially Fox News, went along with the election fraud and failed to discover them.
[02:42:39.886 --> 02:42:45.850]  There was a book by Molly Hemingway, for example, about a major conservative book about fraud.
[02:42:45.850 --> 02:42:50.613]  And she, too, failed to talk about the Edison data, which showed how many votes... Hold on, stay there.
[02:42:50.613 --> 02:42:52.994]  Let's come back in the final segment with Joel Skousen.
[02:42:52.994 --> 02:42:53.915]  Big picture straight ahead.
[02:42:57.884 --> 02:43:07.046]  Nootropics is a fancy way of saying brain pill, and it is the fastest growing market in supplements in the world, for good reason.
[02:43:07.046 --> 02:43:14.387]  There are a lot of amazing compounds out there, some healthy, some not, that do incredible things in our brains.
[02:43:14.387 --> 02:43:23.729]  And we've tried them all, we've researched them all, and we will not sell you anything that is linked to any problems or any type of toxicity or any type of extreme hangovers.
[02:43:24.569 --> 02:43:29.451]  Because I'm not saying some of our brain products, you won't have a little bit of a letdown once you take them, but that should be a lie.
[02:43:29.451 --> 02:43:33.613]  But these are very, very clean with compounds that God gave us that are good for you.
[02:43:33.613 --> 02:43:41.156]  And one of our best sellers is back in stock, Brain Force Plus, a good, clean nootropic, a good, clean brain pill.
[02:43:41.156 --> 02:43:43.437]  You can find something stronger, but it's not good for you.
[02:43:43.437 --> 02:43:45.178]  This is a high quality system.
[02:43:45.178 --> 02:43:47.259]  It's available at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:43:47.259 --> 02:43:50.000]  It's sold out for a long time at 40% off.

[02:43:54.122 --> 02:43:56.110]  Thank you so much, and I'll see you out there.
[02:43:57.498 --> 02:44:07.785]  If you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad, wait till they've got their world ID in, and that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about.
[02:44:07.785 --> 02:44:20.694]  And Klaus Schwab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders' own words, they admit that once they've gotten you with that system, then they're going to carbon tax you everywhere you go and track what you do.
[02:44:20.694 --> 02:44:25.297]  And publicly, they're saying they're going to decide when you can travel and when you can't travel.
[02:44:25.657 --> 02:44:34.920]  And MasterCard and all the other big companies are currently announcing they're gonna track what you do and where you go and tax you with a carbon tax for it.
[02:44:34.920 --> 02:44:38.502]  This is the holy grail of tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:38.502 --> 02:44:41.323]  This is the takeover and humanity better wake up and say no.
[02:44:41.923 --> 02:44:43.625]  Finally, folks are starting to wake up.
[02:44:43.625 --> 02:44:47.088]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, and others are leading the charge, along with Infowars.
[02:44:47.088 --> 02:44:47.949]  But it's not enough.
[02:44:47.949 --> 02:44:53.034]  Every individual has to not comply, and we have to talk about bringing the globalists to justice.
[02:44:53.034 --> 02:44:56.338]  You see, they need the fear of God put in them, legally and lawfully.
[02:44:57.276 --> 02:45:00.819]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here.
[02:45:00.819 --> 02:45:15.550]  All over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany, these tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, and then coming to your house and threatening, in some cases actually, taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[02:45:15.550 --> 02:45:23.756]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process, where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[02:45:24.116 --> 02:45:25.916]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[02:45:25.916 --> 02:45:33.738]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high-quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S.

[02:46:58.197 --> 02:47:04.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:12.571 --> 02:47:18.875]  All right, final segment with Joe Skousen, and he's a smart geopolitical analyst, been very accurate over the years.
[02:47:18.875 --> 02:47:24.918]  You can find his book and the film I co-made with him on strategic relocation at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:47:24.918 --> 02:47:26.999]  That helps keep us on the air.
[02:47:26.999 --> 02:47:31.321]  You can go to WorldOfFirstBrief.com and read all the great articles and see the great material there.
[02:47:31.321 --> 02:47:35.664]  And also you can click on the red link there and get a free copy of his newsletter that comes out tomorrow.
[02:47:37.185 --> 02:47:41.286]  Joel, big picture, and I don't want to write myself into the story, it's just true.
[02:47:41.286 --> 02:47:45.867]  I'm under investigation, it's admitted, for sedition and conspiracy by the FBI.
[02:47:45.867 --> 02:47:47.648]  They've told us that.
[02:47:47.648 --> 02:47:48.868]  We talk to them all the time.
[02:47:48.868 --> 02:47:51.889]  We've got the subpoenas here, it's all ongoing, it's ridiculous.
[02:47:51.889 --> 02:47:56.090]  I didn't pre-plan an attack on the Capitol, I didn't attack the Capitol.
[02:47:56.090 --> 02:48:02.132]  But they're now betting, it looks like their whole campaign, and everything they're doing with the midterms in 291 days,
[02:48:03.826 --> 02:48:03.926]  Yes.
[02:48:24.813 --> 02:48:34.521]  When Biden said a week and a half ago, Republicans are a domestic enemy, and Mitch McConnell's not like some anti-globalist, but he's been like, whoa, whoa, whoa, this is dangerous.
[02:48:34.521 --> 02:48:39.324]  I think even the Republican establishment is starting to figure out the Democratic Party is crazy.
[02:48:39.324 --> 02:48:42.187]  What do you think?
[02:48:42.187 --> 02:48:46.430]  Well, they're not crazy, but they're certainly evil.
[02:48:46.430 --> 02:48:46.950]  Yeah.
[02:48:46.950 --> 02:48:49.673]  And that can look very, very crazy.
[02:48:49.673 --> 02:48:51.734]  But they are the epitome of evil.
[02:48:51.734 --> 02:48:52.815]  There's a lot of satanic
[02:48:53.573 --> 02:48:54.974]  Inspiration and component.
[02:48:54.974 --> 02:49:02.722]  There's a lot of hatred among the Democratic far-left elite against any goodness in America.
[02:49:02.722 --> 02:49:04.123]  They just hate it.
[02:49:04.123 --> 02:49:11.450]  And you can see that come out at many of their acolytes that are elected to school boards and prosecutors and other things.
[02:49:11.450 --> 02:49:14.453]  I was about to say, I'm not a perfect person, but I love Jesus.
[02:49:14.453 --> 02:49:17.856]  When I'm around the left, they just go, like, it like comes out of them.
[02:49:17.856 --> 02:49:18.597]  They can't hide it now.
[02:49:19.935 --> 02:49:20.875]  Yeah, they really do.
[02:49:20.875 --> 02:49:27.078]  I think Satan is beginning to rage in the hearts of men, as prophesied in the Bible, and that's very, very crucial.
[02:49:27.078 --> 02:49:31.059]  There's nothing you can do to really stop that.
[02:49:31.059 --> 02:49:47.486]  The January 6th investigation is aimed at, first of all, a public relations campaign to demonize the idea of Americans, the so-called right wing, but also it's to energize and justify Department of Justice going after, domestically, people
[02:49:49.379 --> 02:49:53.903]  And investigating them like yourself and anyone else that they want to.
[02:49:53.903 --> 02:49:55.985]  That's part of a censorship campaign.
[02:49:55.985 --> 02:49:59.567]  It's part of a deliberate campaign to get you off of the air, Alex.
[02:49:59.567 --> 02:50:05.072]  And that's why it's very important that your listeners support what you're doing, which is very strong.
[02:50:05.072 --> 02:50:12.598]  But additionally, it's going to lead eventually what they'd like to do once they get into full digital banking is the cutting off of people from their bank accounts.
[02:50:14.258 --> 02:50:23.225]  You know, just like Mike Lindell had his bank there in Minnesota completely cut him off and say that, you know, you've got to find banking elsewhere.
[02:50:23.225 --> 02:50:30.891]  Now he's got enough millions that he can get banking elsewhere, but smaller people that get blacklisted are going to have trouble in the future.
[02:50:30.891 --> 02:50:32.593]  Yeah, this is a foreshadowing of what's coming.
[02:50:32.593 --> 02:50:34.274]  And where are the Republicans?
[02:50:34.274 --> 02:50:35.355]  Where is Donald Trump?
[02:50:35.355 --> 02:50:37.317]  Where are any of them saying no to this?
[02:50:39.901 --> 02:50:46.148]  Well, they're not there because they really don't understand conspiracy and those that do, for example, are afraid to death.
[02:50:46.849 --> 02:50:48.570]  To come out and talk about it directly.
[02:51:15.253 --> 02:51:26.581]  Well, it's that they don't want to see it because they see enough of the extreme censorship, the blackballing and the destruction of any CEO that comes out.
[02:51:26.581 --> 02:51:38.289]  And hence, I mean, even Elon Musk, when he came out and bucked against the the Nevada restrictions on the California restrictions and COVID, he just got crucified by the president.
[02:51:38.289 --> 02:51:40.030]  It doesn't take much for CEOs to
[02:51:40.843 --> 02:52:00.256]  To see this, you know, I have a brother who's very conservative and who's an economist and yet he won't touch conspiracy with the 10-foot pole because he knows he won't get interviewed by Ludlow and other people's, you know, in the mainstream media if he ever buys into conspiracy.
[02:52:00.256 --> 02:52:08.481]  And so it is a very strong dampening effect that's taken years to develop in the media hostility towards conspiracy theorists.
[02:52:08.905 --> 02:52:09.927]  Well, I have news for them.
[02:52:09.927 --> 02:52:12.393]  There's a lot of conspiracy facts to back up the theory.
[02:52:12.393 --> 02:52:18.307]  And the only reason we have to deal in theory is because they hide most of the facts behind the veil of national security.
[02:52:19.278 --> 02:52:24.879]  And so that we'll never know what really happened during JFK and all the government involvement there.
[02:52:24.879 --> 02:52:25.759]  Well, I totally agree.
[02:52:25.759 --> 02:52:26.859]  And so what are they going to do?
[02:52:26.859 --> 02:52:31.800]  Because I tried to get Joe Rogan four years ago to be anti-New World Order because I know he was smart.
[02:52:31.800 --> 02:52:33.401]  He figured out that's a giant audience.
[02:52:33.401 --> 02:52:33.821]  That's great.
[02:52:33.821 --> 02:52:34.481]  He's doing it now.
[02:52:34.481 --> 02:52:36.061]  So his show's exploded.
[02:52:36.061 --> 02:52:41.722]  How are they going to deal with it as the public figures out that things are conspiratorial and that that's really the reality?
[02:52:41.722 --> 02:52:46.563]  I mean, because it doesn't matter how many people they take out, how many people they silence, this information is coming out.
[02:52:48.902 --> 02:52:51.705]  Well, it is coming out, but it's only in limited distribution.
[02:52:51.705 --> 02:53:01.854]  You know, the COVID false exaggerated pandemic proved that 80% of Americans still get almost all their news from the mainstream media.
[02:53:02.529 --> 02:53:11.833]  And that leaves about 20% who deal in the alternative media, and that's not enough to ever get it to be widespread and fused, especially when you control public education.
[02:53:11.833 --> 02:53:19.237]  That's one of the biggest mistakes that ever was made in the America, is to have public funding and control of public education.
[02:53:19.237 --> 02:53:20.817]  It should have always remained private.
[02:53:20.817 --> 02:53:21.418]  Well, that's right.
[02:53:21.418 --> 02:53:27.981]  That's why it's came over in some ways, because you could give people the truth, but so many of them don't know how to even learn.
[02:53:27.981 --> 02:53:30.642]  They've been so dumbed down, you can't even communicate with them.
[02:53:32.469 --> 02:53:32.909]  That's right.
[02:53:32.909 --> 02:53:40.635]  As I say, it's an 80% versus 20% ratio here, and they're growing theirs faster than we're growing ours.
[02:53:40.635 --> 02:53:47.339]  Now, it has resulted in a strong polarization in America, and I don't think there's ever going to be any united ever again.
[02:53:47.339 --> 02:53:52.883]  The left is going to get more and more evil, and they're driving more of the millennials through.
[02:53:54.195 --> 02:54:00.944]  Collegiate and high school education into woke doctrines, critical race theory and evolution.
[02:54:00.944 --> 02:54:04.488]  All of that is anti-God and it's destroying.
[02:54:04.488 --> 02:54:09.314]  And unfortunately, you know, most conservatives still send their kids to the public schools.
[02:54:09.314 --> 02:54:10.576]  I don't understand it, Alex.
[02:54:11.678 --> 02:54:16.962]  Even though homeschooling has grown by, you know, several million and represents almost 11%.
[02:54:16.962 --> 02:54:18.063]  No, but you're right.
[02:54:18.063 --> 02:54:20.644]  The whole future is going to be the exodus out of this system.
[02:54:20.644 --> 02:54:21.645]  It's predatory.
[02:54:21.645 --> 02:54:24.547]  And people better figure out this thing is going to destroy you.
[02:54:24.547 --> 02:54:25.608]  You've got to get out of it now.
[02:54:27.179 --> 02:54:27.539]  That's right.
[02:54:27.539 --> 02:54:31.183]  And part of getting out is why I wrote Strategic Relocation.
[02:54:31.183 --> 02:54:34.125]  You know, people need to get out of the big cities.
[02:54:34.125 --> 02:54:41.853]  They need to get rural where you can have more control over your life so that you have freedom from pollution, freedom from these ideas, freedom from the social.
[02:54:42.673 --> 02:54:44.674]  And freedom from the vaccine mandates.
[02:54:44.674 --> 02:54:46.734]  You hardly ever see any of that stuff in the rural.
[02:54:46.734 --> 02:54:48.335]  It's not enforced.
[02:54:48.335 --> 02:54:50.155]  Local sheriffs don't want to do that.
[02:54:50.155 --> 02:55:04.180]  But I'm here to tell you, because I do consultations regularly on strategic relocation, people are complaining it's almost too late in the game to relocate because there's so many people getting out of the big cities because of the COVID nonsense.
[02:55:04.180 --> 02:55:05.680]  And that's driving the prices up.
[02:55:05.680 --> 02:55:06.180]  Exactly.
[02:55:06.180 --> 02:55:07.681]  People should have listened to you 20 years ago.
[02:55:07.681 --> 02:55:09.081]  Yeah.
[02:55:09.932 --> 02:55:11.853]  And so it's getting late in the game.
[02:55:11.853 --> 02:55:15.994]  Now, I'll tell you, when war comes, it's too late to relocate.
[02:55:15.994 --> 02:55:21.337]  You've got to make your plans before that happens because it will be preceded by an EMP strike.
[02:55:21.337 --> 02:55:22.297]  That was my next question.
[02:55:22.297 --> 02:55:28.760]  When do you think this big war, you've been saying, you've been saying 2025 for about 20 years, it seems.
[02:55:28.760 --> 02:55:32.021]  Well, I'm now saying the latter part of this decade because
[02:55:32.873 --> 02:55:39.139]  Russia and China still are very wary of the secret weapon systems the United States is building.
[02:55:39.139 --> 02:55:41.521]  And I think a lot of those weapons are going into space.
[02:55:41.521 --> 02:55:47.646]  That's why China and Russia are gearing up to try to take out satellites, because they probably suspect that the U.S.
[02:55:47.646 --> 02:55:49.908]  has space-based interceptors.
[02:55:49.908 --> 02:55:59.337]  As General Mattis told a Booz Allen private conference, he said, you'd be surprised how many trillions that aren't on the budget are going into space.
[02:56:00.356 --> 02:56:02.558]  Now those aren't just reconnaissance satellites.
[02:56:02.558 --> 02:56:07.923]  I think those are space-based interceptors, which they will not use to defend against that first strike.
[02:56:07.923 --> 02:56:14.790]  They want the military decapitated so they can talk Americans into joining a militarized global government.
[02:56:14.790 --> 02:56:17.873]  That's the whole goal of these globalist three wars that we've had.
[02:56:17.873 --> 02:56:19.415]  World War I, II, and III.
[02:56:19.415 --> 02:56:20.656]  They want total commitment.
[02:56:21.727 --> 02:56:30.331]  They want total commitment to global, and you can't get Americans into a global government without a third world war where our military is decapitated.
[02:56:30.331 --> 02:56:40.835]  It is the perfect thing, and that's why PDD-60 is still secret, is because it tells our missile forces to absorb a nuclear first strike and retaliate afterwards, which is
[02:56:42.455 --> 02:56:46.077]  But couldn't people like you convince the Russians and Chinese to back off?
[02:56:46.077 --> 02:56:50.799]  I mean, we see them backing away from globalism and one-child policies.
[02:56:50.799 --> 02:56:52.180]  Maybe freedom won't spring here.
[02:56:52.180 --> 02:56:56.162]  Maybe the Chinese or Russians figure this out.
[02:56:56.162 --> 02:56:57.863]  No, no, they're ruthless.
[02:56:57.863 --> 02:57:04.946]  When you look at the speech that was leaked to the Epoch Times of General Hao Tian, the former defense minister of China,
[02:57:05.558 --> 02:57:07.719]  They're going to be ruthless with Americans.
[02:57:07.719 --> 02:57:11.141]  You know, the Nazis, in their view, were pampering to the West.
[02:57:11.141 --> 02:57:19.645]  We're going to be ruthless in cleansing the country, and so I don't expect... It looks like Xi Jinping admires Hitler.
[02:57:19.645 --> 02:57:23.267]  Yes, and actually despises his weakness.
[02:57:23.267 --> 02:57:26.289]  He was too weak on the West, according to Hao Tian.
[02:57:26.289 --> 02:57:29.690]  So this is a very serious situation we're facing in the future.
[02:57:29.690 --> 02:57:34.453]  I'm expecting World War III in the latter half of this decade, when Russia and China are fully
[02:57:35.154 --> 02:57:37.899]  Prepared militarily to take on the West.
[02:57:37.899 --> 02:57:40.823]  They're just now deploying some hypersonic missiles.
[02:57:40.823 --> 02:57:42.166]  They don't have them in great numbers.
[02:57:42.166 --> 02:57:43.688]  Hold on, you talked about that a decade ago.
[02:57:43.688 --> 02:57:45.912]  We'll be right back with one more segment with Joe Skousen.
[02:57:46.752 --> 02:57:52.999]  Hey N4 Warriors, if you're like me, you've been a long time listener of this program, and you're fed up with everything going on in the world.
[02:57:52.999 --> 02:57:56.643]  Inside you, like me, a fire is burning.
[02:57:56.643 --> 02:57:57.965]  Something needs to change.
[02:57:57.965 --> 02:58:00.187]  And yet, we feel helpless.
[02:58:00.187 --> 02:58:04.212]  Almost like we're stuck inside a system that someone else created for us.
[02:58:04.212 --> 02:58:06.074]  It's time for us to break free from that system.
[02:58:06.434 --> 02:58:09.056]  Reset Wars is a game changer.
[02:58:09.056 --> 02:58:14.200]  You start to see yourself more as part of the solution instead of just as a victim.
[02:58:14.200 --> 02:58:22.266]  So much of the stuff we look at today is low vibration, low energy, and makes us depressed and therefore we manifest this negative reality out there.
[02:58:22.266 --> 02:58:27.711]  When they feel their lie-cheat-steal plan to enslave and rob the people, there is an awakening.
[02:58:27.711 --> 02:58:30.713]  Reset Wars has helped me to navigate
[02:58:31.133 --> 02:58:37.418]  And to pinpoint and lock on to the deep-rooted psychological tactics that were being used against me.
[02:58:37.418 --> 02:58:39.100]  And now I'm not scared anymore.
[02:58:39.100 --> 02:58:41.021]  I have to say I was blown away.
[02:58:41.021 --> 02:58:44.564]  I feel so much better every day listening to it.
[02:58:44.564 --> 02:58:47.307]  To Alex, thank you very much for putting the course together.
[02:58:47.307 --> 02:58:48.848]  You're absolutely right.
[02:58:48.848 --> 02:58:51.190]  We are reflections of God.
[02:58:51.190 --> 02:58:52.731]  We are emanations of that.
[02:58:52.731 --> 02:58:56.995]  And we can use that God energy to do really anything we want to do in this life.
[02:58:57.415 --> 02:59:01.860]  Romans Chapter 12, Paul talks about how we're transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[02:59:01.860 --> 02:59:02.961]  And that's a process.
[02:59:02.961 --> 02:59:06.025]  Most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious.
[02:59:06.025 --> 02:59:08.528]  Most people go through their day and don't think about many things.
[02:59:08.528 --> 02:59:11.851]  You can drive along a long journey and not even remember half the trip.
[02:59:12.332 --> 02:59:19.434]  In this process, we need to have a concerted, active effort, physically and mentally, to reprogram that subconscious mind.
[02:59:19.434 --> 02:59:23.035]  That's what this series is about, is resetting our mind.
[02:59:23.035 --> 02:59:24.695]  Because there's a war on for our mind.
[02:59:24.695 --> 02:59:25.996]  He's exactly right.
[02:59:25.996 --> 02:59:30.657]  And he's become a great voice in our generation, and in this new Great Awakening.
[02:59:30.657 --> 02:59:35.398]  And I encourage everybody out there, if you haven't gone there yet, go to ResetWars.com.
[02:59:35.398 --> 02:59:36.759]  That's where your journey begins.
[02:59:49.111 --> 03:00:00.674]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:00.674 --> 03:00:06.975]  Alright, the news at Infowars.com that I've not covered in the last hour is insane, but what Joel Skousen had to say was so important.
[03:00:08.038 --> 03:00:16.691]  But man, COVID vaccines are growing new variants inside VAX bodies, claims top Bill Gates scientist.
[03:00:16.691 --> 03:00:24.362]  We've got footage of This Is America, NYPD arrest, nine-year-old girl trying to go to the museum without a vaccine passport.
[03:00:26.226 --> 03:00:28.967]  I mean, this is just good old fashioned evil.
[03:00:28.967 --> 03:00:42.710]  Joel Skousen, with all the incredible things going on in the world, in closing, what do you want to impart to this audience of several million souls of every race, color, and creed that want truth?
[03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:51.253]  Well, first message I would like to put forward is don't expect anyone politically to rise as a savior for us.
[03:00:52.634 --> 03:01:08.363]  I think the deep state is so much so powerful and so deeply controlled of government that even if I were president with all I know about deep state and conspiracy, it's almost impossible to root it out because they control the surveillance equipment.
[03:01:08.363 --> 03:01:14.647]  In order to take these people down in the American system of justice, you would have to have actual evidence of surveillance.
[03:01:15.086 --> 03:01:18.627]  And now we're watching images of nine-year-olds arrested for not wearing masks in New York.
[03:01:18.627 --> 03:01:20.328]  I mean, these are just bone-chilling images, Joel Skousen.
[03:01:45.388 --> 03:01:47.469]  And that's going to continue in the big picture.
[03:01:47.469 --> 03:02:06.735]  Remember that the COVID conspiracy to exaggerate a pandemic and the COVID virus is real and it is a very strong virus, but it's only deadly to people with chronic ill disease, illnesses and disease, or with vaccine damage from having taken years of vaccines.
[03:02:06.735 --> 03:02:07.655]  It is not a threat.
[03:02:07.655 --> 03:02:10.036]  It shouldn't be a pandemic.
[03:02:10.036 --> 03:02:12.297]  But they are using it, of course, now to
[03:02:12.964 --> 03:02:17.926]  Separate society into the vaccinated and the un-vaxxed.
[03:02:17.926 --> 03:02:23.509]  And the war on the vaccination, as I've covered in the past two briefs, is really growing to be very significant.
[03:02:23.509 --> 03:02:29.352]  Oh, you were on 20 plus years ago and we said, UN enforced forced inoculation, because that was in our white papers.
[03:02:29.352 --> 03:02:30.012]  And now we're here.
[03:02:30.012 --> 03:02:33.294]  People wonder how you and I know all this.
[03:02:33.294 --> 03:02:34.995]  Why do our enemies in closing do this?
[03:02:34.995 --> 03:02:38.576]  They'll admit in white papers what they're going to do, but then the general public deny it.
[03:02:38.576 --> 03:02:39.777]  But why do they still admit it?
[03:02:43.286 --> 03:02:52.312]  I think it's because there's so much, they're so confident in their control that they can openly admit things and realize that the people are really powerless to stop it.
[03:02:52.312 --> 03:02:54.334]  That's what's the scary thing.
[03:02:54.334 --> 03:03:07.562]  But it's very, very important to realize that this COVID thing is that we're never going to let us be free from this COVID or any virus because it can mutate and they can go on beyond the Omicron and have any of it.
[03:03:07.562 --> 03:03:08.743]  It's an endless emergency.
[03:03:08.743 --> 03:03:10.845]  It's the perfect power grab.
[03:03:10.845 --> 03:03:11.265]  That's right.
[03:03:11.877 --> 03:03:18.462]  But it's going to, you've got to be prepared rather than hope for a savior, for hope for a cure, to hope for a vaccine.
[03:03:18.462 --> 03:03:18.902]  I agree.
[03:03:18.902 --> 03:03:24.526]  That was the worst part about Trump is that you said this like three years ago and I wasn't quite there yet, but you were right again, Joel.
[03:03:24.526 --> 03:03:25.948]  We can't put all our faith in him.
[03:03:25.948 --> 03:03:28.449]  It's got to be in God and ourselves taking action.
[03:03:28.449 --> 03:03:32.072]  And that was the problem with Trump is the whole Q thing.
[03:03:32.072 --> 03:03:32.492]  That's right.
[03:03:32.492 --> 03:03:38.257]  And the action that you've got to take is get prepared to get out of establishment society as difficult as that is.
[03:03:39.332 --> 03:03:44.875]  People keep crying out to me in emails, saying, I've got to maintain my job, but they're going to require the vaccine.
[03:03:44.875 --> 03:03:46.617]  I said, forget the job.
[03:03:46.617 --> 03:03:47.717]  Get retrained.
[03:03:47.717 --> 03:03:48.618]  Start preparing.
[03:03:48.618 --> 03:03:52.700]  Because once you start complying, there's no end to these boosters.
[03:03:52.700 --> 03:03:59.985]  And you're going to get killed or chronic disease from these vaccines if you continue to take them, if you haven't already.
[03:03:59.985 --> 03:04:00.305]  That's right.
[03:04:00.305 --> 03:04:01.206]  It's a total trap.
[03:04:01.206 --> 03:04:02.426]  And nobody's happy about it.
[03:04:02.426 --> 03:04:06.369]  But every instinct I've got is get out of the city and just
[03:04:07.802 --> 03:04:10.564]  I have to fight just to stay on air, Joel, because I know how real this is.
[03:04:10.564 --> 03:04:16.729]  I mean, I am like, I'm ready to evacuate my family, but I've got to balance that with staying on air to fight as much as possible.
[03:04:16.729 --> 03:04:18.430]  But I realize what you said 20 years ago is true.
[03:04:18.430 --> 03:04:19.831]  We're not going to fix this, only God is.
[03:04:21.161 --> 03:04:21.881]  That's right.
[03:04:21.881 --> 03:04:29.863]  And God, unfortunately, has ruled that we're going to go through the tribulation because people have lost their sense of morality.
[03:04:29.863 --> 03:04:33.684]  They're no longer listening to conscience, in terms of the majority of people.
[03:04:33.684 --> 03:04:35.345]  And that's what's wrong.
[03:04:35.345 --> 03:04:40.166]  Look at the rapid growth in homosexuality and this transgender nonsense.
[03:04:40.166 --> 03:04:40.546]  All of it.
[03:04:40.546 --> 03:04:41.327]  Joel, we're out of time.
[03:04:41.327 --> 03:04:42.047]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:42.047 --> 03:04:43.527]  WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[03:04:43.527 --> 03:04:45.248]  America and the world is under judgment.
[03:04:45.248 --> 03:04:45.928]  Thank you so much, sir.
[03:04:47.056 --> 03:04:47.496]  Thank you.
[03:04:47.496 --> 03:04:54.842]  We've got a few final breaking news stories and then we've got great guest host Kate Daly taking over.

[03:05:23.743 --> 03:05:27.385]  Then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[03:05:27.385 --> 03:05:33.910]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[03:05:33.910 --> 03:05:35.851]  It even tastes better than the last formula.
[03:05:35.851 --> 03:05:38.332]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[03:05:38.332 --> 03:05:41.915]  Again, it has that cutting-edge chicken broth protein.
[03:05:42.475 --> 03:05:45.758]  Isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[03:05:45.758 --> 03:05:46.739]  You're gonna love this.
[03:05:46.739 --> 03:05:50.824]  And what it does for your joints, what it does for your body, what it does for your bones is simply amazing.
[03:05:50.824 --> 03:05:52.685]  And it helps fund the InfoWarp.
[03:05:52.685 --> 03:05:54.888]  This is really the best bone broth out there.
[03:05:54.888 --> 03:05:56.830]  So get yours at InfoWarpStore.com today.
[03:06:27.879 --> 03:06:30.102]  And we are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:06:30.102 --> 03:06:34.507]  The big story is up on InfoWars.com.
[03:06:34.507 --> 03:06:36.349]  COVID vaccines are growing.
[03:06:36.349 --> 03:06:41.836]  New variants inside VAX bodies, claims Top Gates-backed doctor.
[03:06:41.836 --> 03:06:46.362]  This is such a huge report, and the wheels are coming off the system.
[03:06:46.362 --> 03:06:47.103]  Here's that clip.
[03:06:48.500 --> 03:06:54.366]  At risk of inducing autoimmune responses, autoimmunity in children.
[03:06:54.366 --> 03:07:02.353]  That's why I'm saying never ever use a vaccine that cannot block transmission when you are on the battlefield.
[03:07:02.353 --> 03:07:08.539]  If you have a vaccine that cannot prevent the transmission,
[03:07:10.231 --> 03:07:14.554]  You cannot control this pandemic.
[03:07:14.554 --> 03:07:16.235]  The virus will escape.
[03:07:16.235 --> 03:07:17.576]  You cannot win this.
[03:07:17.576 --> 03:07:18.476]  It's impossible.
[03:07:18.476 --> 03:07:23.019]  So in other words, with this mass vaccination, you're doing exactly the opposite.
[03:07:23.019 --> 03:07:30.564]  You are generating a breeding ground for even more infectious variants to replicate.
[03:07:30.564 --> 03:07:32.326]  Scientifically, there is
[03:07:34.023 --> 03:07:38.065]  No rational whatsoever to vaccinate children.
[03:07:38.065 --> 03:07:39.746]  This cannot be justified.
[03:07:39.746 --> 03:07:43.629]  There is no added value whatsoever for children.
[03:07:43.629 --> 03:07:49.132]  There is only major concerns and major risks.
[03:07:49.132 --> 03:07:56.176]  So we know definitely that the risk-benefit ratio is going in a completely wrong direction.
[03:07:56.176 --> 03:07:59.858]  So how on earth can you, with that knowledge,
[03:08:01.055 --> 03:08:03.957]  Can you even think of doing such a thing?
[03:08:03.957 --> 03:08:06.198]  I have no other words.
[03:08:06.198 --> 03:08:07.538]  This is criminal.
[03:08:07.538 --> 03:08:12.841]  And, you know, as a scientist, we don't use these words lightly.
[03:08:12.841 --> 03:08:16.003]  Well, you hear me saying exactly the opposite.
[03:08:16.003 --> 03:08:22.746]  That when you get vaccinated, there is no chance that you can contribute to herd immunity.
[03:08:22.746 --> 03:08:25.668]  And my advice is very, very clear.
[03:08:26.972 --> 03:08:33.777]  Under no single circumstance should you allow to get your child vaccinated.
[03:08:42.386 --> 03:08:48.470]  Part of me fighting 28 years wants to just say, I've done my job, been in the fight, I can bow out now, but I can't do that.
[03:08:48.470 --> 03:08:57.817]  That's why we fight so hard, is there's not many outposts that can reach millions of people like we're able to do right now.
[03:08:57.817 --> 03:09:06.363]  And then if I can get the millions of you watching and listening to share this article and that video you just saw, it won't get 2 million views, it'll get 20 million views.
[03:09:06.363 --> 03:09:08.505]  And then if those people shared it, we'd get 100 million views.
[03:09:09.790 --> 03:09:12.812]  This is a life-and-death situation.
[03:09:12.812 --> 03:09:16.854]  The article is, COVID vaccines are growing, new variants inside VAX bodies.
[03:09:16.854 --> 03:09:19.116]  Claims, Top Gates back doctor.
[03:09:19.116 --> 03:09:20.737]  He's not claiming, it's a fact.
[03:09:20.737 --> 03:09:23.418]  Pfizer admits it.
[03:09:23.418 --> 03:09:24.759]  Then we've got this article.
[03:09:24.759 --> 03:09:28.902]  I showed the video as B-roll earlier, but let's show it with audio.
[03:09:28.902 --> 03:09:29.982]  This is America.
[03:09:29.982 --> 03:09:38.328]  NYPD arrests nine-year-old girl and five others for trying to enter a museum of natural history without a VAX passport.
[03:09:38.328 --> 03:09:38.708]  Here it is.
[03:09:40.450 --> 03:09:43.391]  This is dystopia.
[03:09:43.391 --> 03:09:50.172]  Look at that little girl, she's strong.
[03:09:50.172 --> 03:09:53.193]  That's the future of America, is that little girl right there.
[03:09:53.193 --> 03:09:53.933]  She's strong.
[03:09:53.933 --> 03:09:56.653]  You understand, they don't own her body.
[03:09:56.653 --> 03:09:57.554]  No.
[03:09:57.554 --> 03:10:01.534]  I know attacking that, what you know, fucking sets it apart.
[03:10:01.534 --> 03:10:04.075]  She's alright, she's gonna do it.
[03:10:04.075 --> 03:10:06.195]  Where are you taking her?
[03:10:06.195 --> 03:10:06.956]  Where are they taking her?
[03:10:06.956 --> 03:10:07.996]  Like, this is fucking fucked up.
[03:10:12.096 --> 03:10:13.557]  I want her parents on Freedom News.
[03:10:13.557 --> 03:10:14.938]  They're taking her to jail.
[03:10:14.938 --> 03:10:18.500]  She tried to go to the museum.
[03:10:18.500 --> 03:10:24.943]  She wouldn't let Pfizer put its evil metal proboscis into her and inject her with death.
[03:10:24.943 --> 03:10:25.683]  Oh, it's liberal.
[03:10:25.683 --> 03:10:26.564]  The women are the cops.
[03:10:26.564 --> 03:10:27.324]  So it's okay.
[03:10:27.324 --> 03:10:31.387]  So sick, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:10:31.387 --> 03:10:32.327]  Not against women being cops.
[03:10:32.327 --> 03:10:39.111]  I'm just saying it's always that nanny state.
[03:10:39.111 --> 03:10:40.872]  A giant exercise in evil.
[03:10:42.062 --> 03:10:48.904]  People pretending they're part of the power structure, pretending they're winning by carrying out these levels of corruption.
[03:10:48.904 --> 03:10:51.205]  Wow!
[03:10:51.205 --> 03:10:52.605]  What a broadcast today.
[03:10:52.605 --> 03:10:58.087]  Kate Dowling of the Kate Dowling D-A-L-L-E-Y show.com is taking over here.
[03:10:58.087 --> 03:11:00.368]  We're going to break this in a moment.
[03:11:00.368 --> 03:11:02.748]  You know, people asked me this morning, they said, why didn't you cover this?
[03:11:02.748 --> 03:11:03.709]  One of the crew members.
[03:11:03.709 --> 03:11:04.929]  I saw it this morning.
[03:11:04.929 --> 03:11:07.550]  I didn't cover because it's already on record, but it's important to hit.
[03:11:08.775 --> 03:11:17.199]  It's now law that satellite tracking kill switches that breathalyze you will be an all new car starting in a few years.
[03:11:17.199 --> 03:11:25.062]  The IRS has come out to require facial recognition to view your tax returns.
[03:11:25.062 --> 03:11:26.603]  And you can say, oh, it's about security.
[03:11:26.603 --> 03:11:29.084]  No, it's all predatory.
[03:11:29.084 --> 03:11:32.766]  And everybody's going to find out about what's happening.
[03:11:32.766 --> 03:11:32.906]  So.
[03:11:36.641 --> 03:11:46.348]  You keep pretending that this isn't an anti-human takeover, that our leaders haven't made a deal with some very, very bad things.
[03:11:46.348 --> 03:11:52.633]  Or you can go ahead and follow your spirit, your instincts, your common sense, and your own analysis and say no to this.
[03:11:52.633 --> 03:12:00.699]  Because you can sit here all day long and make excuses, but at the end of the day, we've got real evil taking over our planet.
[03:12:00.699 --> 03:12:05.283]  And so, I'm funding our operation because of viewers like you.
[03:12:06.946 --> 03:12:24.983]  And I want to thank you all for your support, but I want to encourage you now more than ever to go to Infowars.com where we have over 300 different t-shirts and long-sleeve shirts and you name it that spread the word about freedom from Let's Go Brandon to Don't Tread on Me 1776 to Infowars.com.
[03:12:24.983 --> 03:12:26.825]  To liberty or death, don't tread on me.
[03:12:28.410 --> 03:12:37.012]  And your purchase of Save the Frog shirt, or Here's My Vaccine Passport, or Let's Go Brandon, or I love that one over there that's the two mice talking to each other.
[03:12:37.012 --> 03:12:38.552]  Have you taken the vaccine yet?
[03:12:38.552 --> 03:12:41.493]  No, I'm waiting for the human trials to finish.
[03:12:41.493 --> 03:12:46.254]  Most likely to succeed, secede and succeed.
[03:12:46.254 --> 03:12:49.375]  Most likely to succeed is America.
[03:12:49.375 --> 03:12:52.316]  Most likely to secede is Texas.
[03:12:52.316 --> 03:12:53.156]  They're all there.
[03:12:53.156 --> 03:12:54.996]  Brand new shirts, no reviews yet.
[03:12:54.996 --> 03:12:57.397]  Bunch of new ball caps, all of it.
[03:12:58.894 --> 03:13:02.059]  And if you don't buy the products, and I'm not bitching at you, we're not going to be on air.
[03:13:02.059 --> 03:13:03.982]  And we are in the crucible of our fight.
[03:13:03.982 --> 03:13:07.888]  We're in the most important phase of our resistance right now, all of us together.
[03:13:07.888 --> 03:13:09.110]  So, InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:13:09.110 --> 03:13:09.791]  And then separately...
[03:13:11.072 --> 03:13:21.640]  We have a Whole Foods, not Whole Foods, the Jeff Bezos store, a Whole Foods multivitamin from Organic Whole Foods, meaning it's not synthetic, meaning it actually helps your body.
[03:13:21.640 --> 03:13:25.262]  It's super high end at a low price, 40% off right now.
[03:13:25.262 --> 03:13:37.411]  And we have InfoWorks Life Vitamin C and Zinc, 1100% of the daily Vitamin C from an organic source, along with a big dose, almost double the dose of Zinc, with Rosehips that does so many other great things.
[03:13:37.411 --> 03:13:38.292]  That is 40% off as well.
[03:13:41.044 --> 03:13:42.125]  at infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:14:01.551 --> 03:14:03.113]  And so many good things have happened.
[03:14:03.113 --> 03:14:07.056]  We've seen the CDC admit masks don't work.
[03:14:07.056 --> 03:14:12.161]  The CDC admit that learned immunity is 20 plus times better, which we already know.
[03:14:12.161 --> 03:14:18.847]  The CDC admit the vaccines don't work, but they're doing it all in fine print to cover their butt.
[03:14:20.248 --> 03:14:39.481]  We have to get it out in the open and let it know that Big Pharma and Bill Gates and the UN and the globalists made their run at us trying to scare us under submission and put us under a world ID and make us submit to them and let them erase our immune system and say, hey, we're not just looking for Boris Johnson and the UK to end the lockdown.
[03:14:39.481 --> 03:14:41.002]  We're not just looking for ending the lockdown.
[03:14:41.002 --> 03:14:42.563]  We're looking for Bill Gates.
[03:14:44.011 --> 03:14:52.098]  And Klaus Schwab, and Dr. Fauci, and Peter Daszak, and the Bat Lady to all go to prison!
[03:14:52.098 --> 03:14:54.380]  Because we've got memories now!
[03:14:54.380 --> 03:15:00.105]  And so we're not just here wanting you off our back and, oh, you leave us alone for a while before you launch the next pandemic.
[03:15:00.105 --> 03:15:01.806]  Gates and Menzies are already planning.
[03:15:01.806 --> 03:15:06.090]  We are going to legally and lawfully through the system educate the public.
[03:15:06.750 --> 03:15:06.830]  It's
[03:15:26.761 --> 03:15:29.482]  futurenews.news.
[03:15:29.482 --> 03:15:31.782]  They banned freeworldnews.tv.
[03:15:31.782 --> 03:15:33.662]  Still a great URL, takes you to the site.
[03:15:33.662 --> 03:15:35.843]  But futurenews.news.
[03:15:35.843 --> 03:15:37.623]  futurenews.news.
[03:15:37.623 --> 03:15:38.723]  They haven't banned it yet.
[03:15:38.723 --> 03:15:40.884]  Took them 10 months to ban the other URL.
[03:15:40.884 --> 03:15:44.144]  That's what you share on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, everywhere.
[03:15:44.144 --> 03:15:46.445]  futurenews.news.
[03:15:46.445 --> 03:15:47.485]  All right, stay with us.
[03:15:47.485 --> 03:15:48.665]  Kate Dowling takes over.
[03:15:55.842 --> 03:16:01.403]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.
[03:16:01.403 --> 03:16:02.443]  Alpha Power.
[03:16:02.443 --> 03:16:05.904]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.

[03:16:28.990 --> 03:16:36.233]  Alpha Power can help boost performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels, support healthy cholesterol and more.
[03:16:36.233 --> 03:16:39.915]  Let Alpha Power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[03:16:39.915 --> 03:16:42.957]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny.
[03:16:42.957 --> 03:16:47.019]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with Alpha Power.
[03:16:47.019 --> 03:16:49.520]  Head to infowarsstore.com today.
[03:16:55.711 --> 03:17:01.494]  Well, I'm very excited for several reasons that two of our very popular products are back in stock.

[03:17:16.501 --> 03:17:20.283]  They're both back in stock, sold out for more than four months at 40% off.
[03:17:22.344 --> 03:17:28.293]  Another reason I'm very, very excited about this is, this will fund our operation and keep us on air.
[03:17:28.293 --> 03:17:37.667]  So again, it's a 360 win, but whatever you do, go out and get an organic, whole food, multivitamin, Antec Vitamin C, Antec Zinc.

[03:17:44.951 --> 03:17:47.592]  We want to keep patriots in the game against the New World Order.
[03:17:47.592 --> 03:17:48.832]  So it's a 360 win.

[03:17:55.595 --> 03:17:59.819]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in InfoWars Live products.
[03:17:59.819 --> 03:18:03.382]  And that's why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[03:18:03.382 --> 03:18:05.984]  And we could never get the ingredients again.
[03:18:05.984 --> 03:18:06.925]  Until now.
[03:18:06.925 --> 03:18:13.010]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[03:18:13.010 --> 03:18:16.793]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[03:18:16.793 --> 03:18:18.014]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[03:18:18.014 --> 03:18:22.798]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.

[03:18:58.568 --> 03:19:12.557]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech, government are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[03:19:12.557 --> 03:19:17.000]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:25.386]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.

[03:20:02.053 --> 03:20:03.335]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:20:11.583 --> 03:20:14.684]  Hi, I'm Kate Daly, your guest host today, and so appreciative.
[03:20:14.684 --> 03:20:23.527]  You know, I'll tell you what, Joel Skousen, very, very good friend of mine, been interviewing him for years, and I love to see him on Alex Jones because he's such a great analysis.
[03:20:23.527 --> 03:20:25.728]  I mean, he just absolutely gets it.
[03:20:25.728 --> 03:20:27.349]  I love that about him.
[03:20:27.349 --> 03:20:33.311]  And I want to share with you today a couple of things that I think are very, very important.
[03:20:33.311 --> 03:20:36.372]  On my way to work, I was listening to the song, Let's Go Crazy by Prince.
[03:20:36.372 --> 03:20:37.172]  You guys remember that, right?
[03:20:37.852 --> 03:20:44.875]  And the opening line of that song is, Dearly Beloved, we are gathered here to get through this thing called life.
[03:20:44.875 --> 03:20:48.717]  And I thought, you know, it is a tough thing right now.
[03:20:48.717 --> 03:20:55.299]  And probably the reason that you're tuned in and watching is because you're trying to figure out what to do about it, right?
[03:20:55.299 --> 03:20:56.940]  And trying to understand it.
[03:20:56.940 --> 03:20:58.841]  These are well-laid plans.
[03:20:58.841 --> 03:21:03.163]  Now, you and I know that because we've invested time into research.
[03:21:03.163 --> 03:21:04.183]  We know what we're talking about.
[03:21:04.855 --> 03:21:21.288]  We understand that these plans have been going on for a long time and each component of those plans drops in a certain way, but they want it to be very isolated so that everybody looks at each component that drops of their well-laid plans as an individual thing.
[03:21:21.288 --> 03:21:29.815]  And then what we do is we go into the weeds trying to decipher that one thing instead of looking at it as a whole.
[03:21:29.815 --> 03:21:31.737]  So what is this episode about?
[03:21:32.429 --> 03:21:34.370]  How to stop propaganda.
[03:21:34.370 --> 03:21:36.830]  How to stop the brainwashing.
[03:21:36.830 --> 03:21:40.531]  Because I think, if anything, we all want to know what to do and how to do it, right?
[03:21:40.531 --> 03:21:43.492]  We all want to know how can we talk to friends and neighbors?
[03:21:43.492 --> 03:21:46.733]  How can we get them to see what's happening?
[03:21:46.733 --> 03:21:50.234]  They're so totally focused on COVID.
[03:21:50.234 --> 03:21:52.315]  They are focused on the drumbeat of war.
[03:21:52.315 --> 03:21:54.855]  They're focused on all these things.
[03:21:54.855 --> 03:21:56.216]  And what do they drive?
[03:21:56.216 --> 03:21:56.896]  Well, they drive fear.
[03:21:57.685 --> 03:21:58.905]  We get it, right?
[03:21:58.905 --> 03:22:03.527]  We've got King Fraud-a-Lot and Hormala doing a number on the American people.
[03:22:03.527 --> 03:22:05.067]  We've been cooed in this nation.
[03:22:05.067 --> 03:22:13.170]  And we do have some techniques and some ways now that we can actually train people to look at the propaganda and recognize it.
[03:22:13.170 --> 03:22:15.511]  And I think that's going to be what's important about this episode today.
[03:22:16.921 --> 03:22:23.165]  One thing that I probably, after 10 years on the radio, can say is that we are inherently a good people.
[03:22:23.165 --> 03:22:26.007]  Because honestly, that's why people wear the mask.
[03:22:26.007 --> 03:22:30.250]  They're controlling little beasts while doing it, but that's why they're doing it, right?
[03:22:30.250 --> 03:22:36.274]  I am a good person and I want you to be a healthy person, so I want to make you do this too.
[03:22:36.274 --> 03:22:40.557]  It does come from a good place, even though it's completely backwards.
[03:22:40.557 --> 03:22:42.178]  It comes from a good place.
[03:22:42.178 --> 03:22:46.341]  So we're inherently a good people, but we're not inherently a bright people, are we?
[03:22:47.000 --> 03:22:48.580]  I mean, let's face it.
[03:22:48.580 --> 03:22:50.621]  We're not very smart.
[03:22:50.621 --> 03:22:51.901]  And that is the problem.
[03:22:51.901 --> 03:22:54.522]  Do you guys remember Rajneesh?
[03:22:54.522 --> 03:22:58.303]  Rajneesh, the Indian guru guy?
[03:22:58.303 --> 03:22:59.603]  I loved what he had to say.
[03:22:59.603 --> 03:22:59.923]  Here we go.
[03:23:12.777 --> 03:23:22.946]  Okay, so this was a clip by Rajneesh and he said, we are a, so let me focus on this one clip real quick.
[03:23:22.946 --> 03:23:31.593]  The people are retarded.
[03:23:31.593 --> 03:23:32.934]  Yes.
[03:23:32.934 --> 03:23:33.154]  Right?
[03:23:36.673 --> 03:23:37.615]  Up the retarded!
[03:23:37.615 --> 03:23:42.222]  Okay, so we know this to be true and this is the problem.
[03:23:42.222 --> 03:23:46.629]  We are a people that doesn't understand what's going on in the big picture.
[03:23:46.629 --> 03:23:48.132]  So how do we do that?
[03:23:48.132 --> 03:23:50.656]  So let me lay down a couple of ways that we can do that.
[03:23:51.579 --> 03:23:54.020]  How do we teach our kids to recognize propaganda?
[03:23:54.020 --> 03:23:58.643]  How do we look at the Russia drumbeat of war right now and figure out if there's a war going on?
[03:23:58.643 --> 03:24:00.083]  So I want to get to this.
[03:24:00.083 --> 03:24:06.547]  I also want to ask you some questions about the January 6th because what is happening in America is we are taught to
[03:24:07.831 --> 03:24:08.211]  Thank you.
[03:24:25.797 --> 03:24:29.138]  And so we're not taught to ask the questions and really think.
[03:24:29.138 --> 03:24:39.563]  And when they started propagandizing the January 6th event right off the bat and never mentioned the Electoral College again, we learned a lot of things, didn't we?
[03:24:39.563 --> 03:24:42.364]  The media stopped talking about the Electoral College.
[03:24:42.364 --> 03:24:42.924]  Bam.
[03:24:42.924 --> 03:24:43.504]  Done.
[03:24:43.504 --> 03:24:44.545]  Never talked about it again.
[03:24:44.545 --> 03:24:45.865]  And that's why people were there.
[03:24:45.865 --> 03:24:50.087]  They wanted to see the votes, you know, recorded and read, right?
[03:24:50.925 --> 03:24:56.670]  They started talking about a group of Americans that were unarmed, waved into the Capitol, taking selfies.
[03:24:56.670 --> 03:25:00.173]  Nobody was talking about the fact that they weren't armed.
[03:25:00.173 --> 03:25:03.716]  Nobody was talking about the fact that they were taking selfies of themselves.
[03:25:03.716 --> 03:25:05.698]  They didn't want you to focus on any of that.
[03:25:05.698 --> 03:25:08.460]  And focus is a big, huge deal with these people.
[03:25:09.355 --> 03:25:12.256]  The four officers did not die because of the Patriots.
[03:25:12.256 --> 03:25:13.536]  They died from other causes.
[03:25:13.536 --> 03:25:14.417]  We know this.
[03:25:14.417 --> 03:25:18.918]  But they'll never change the official narrative in Wikipedia.
[03:25:18.918 --> 03:25:19.218]  Right?
[03:25:19.218 --> 03:25:21.259]  They'll never, ever change it.
[03:25:21.259 --> 03:25:27.521]  In fact, they never talked about anything again except death.
[03:25:27.521 --> 03:25:28.841]  Death by the Patriots.
[03:25:28.841 --> 03:25:29.441]  Because why?
[03:25:29.441 --> 03:25:31.382]  They had to villainize us.
[03:25:31.382 --> 03:25:36.824]  There were no arrests for firearms because nobody was armed.
[03:25:36.824 --> 03:25:37.644]  Where was the violence?
[03:25:38.386 --> 03:25:45.348]  No one looked like they'd been in an altercation, yet they claimed 140 officers had to seek medical attention.
[03:25:45.348 --> 03:25:46.028]  Why'd they do that?
[03:25:46.028 --> 03:25:48.149]  It's insane, right?
[03:25:48.149 --> 03:25:49.510]  Did anyone have a black eye?
[03:25:49.510 --> 03:25:51.610]  Did anyone look like they were in a tussle?
[03:25:51.610 --> 03:25:53.371]  Of course not.
[03:25:53.371 --> 03:25:58.872]  No patriots were walking around, people that love this country that looked like they'd been in any kind of fight.
[03:25:58.872 --> 03:26:02.293]  And beyond that, had they been, they'd have been shot.
[03:26:02.293 --> 03:26:04.174]  These are Capitol policemen.
[03:26:04.174 --> 03:26:07.155]  They would have said, I have every right to shoot you because you're going after me.
[03:26:08.107 --> 03:26:10.028]  None of those things happened.
[03:26:10.028 --> 03:26:16.850]  The media has lied for a year about those four officers dying because they all died of other causes.
[03:26:16.850 --> 03:26:28.093]  I got into a little fight with one of our FBI darlings over the fact that the fire extinguisher event never happened.
[03:26:28.093 --> 03:26:30.674]  He called me a liar over and over again.
[03:26:30.674 --> 03:26:32.215]  On the air.
[03:26:32.215 --> 03:26:33.395]  Well, wasn't it true?
[03:26:34.045 --> 03:26:41.390]  Coroner came out and said nothing happened to that officer, as far as anything on the outward appearance or internal damage.
[03:26:41.390 --> 03:26:43.652]  Fire extinguisher never took place.
[03:26:43.652 --> 03:26:49.176]  But we're not taught to ask, well, why did they have to resort to a fire extinguisher lie?
[03:26:49.176 --> 03:26:53.159]  Because if it was an armed insurrection, we would have been armed with guns.
[03:26:53.159 --> 03:26:55.100]  Correct?
[03:26:55.100 --> 03:27:00.123]  So, if anyone had tried to be violent, they would have been shot on sight.
[03:27:00.123 --> 03:27:03.566]  Had they tried to be violent, they would have actually received charges.
[03:27:04.631 --> 03:27:09.957]  The two that were charged with the fire extinction, actually, they had to remove those charges.
[03:27:09.957 --> 03:27:13.001]  Because in the end, we know the truth.
[03:27:13.001 --> 03:27:15.384]  We're not taught to ask questions.
[03:27:15.384 --> 03:27:18.948]  We're not taught to ask, hey, did anyone look like they'd been in any altercation?
[03:27:18.948 --> 03:27:21.331]  Was this really an armed insurrection?
[03:27:21.331 --> 03:27:22.112]  Of course not.
[03:27:22.112 --> 03:27:23.133]  We're not taught to ask.
[03:27:23.843 --> 03:27:29.387]  We're just taught to feel the emotion of what they're saying and talk about theater and grandstanding.
[03:27:29.387 --> 03:27:36.352]  It reminds me of that old stick song, you know, this is the show, the grand illusion, and that's what it is.
[03:27:36.352 --> 03:27:38.774]  So how do we get people to understand this?
[03:27:38.774 --> 03:27:40.175]  How do we unwind it?
[03:27:40.175 --> 03:27:46.860]  How do you go back and show people, hey, wait a minute, all of the obvious questions were never asked.
[03:27:46.860 --> 03:27:51.183]  All of the obvious questions were never, were never even pointed to really.
[03:27:52.389 --> 03:27:55.211]  They didn't want you to focus on it.
[03:27:55.211 --> 03:27:57.073]  Nobody was armed.
[03:27:57.073 --> 03:28:01.517]  They walked into a building, took selfies while the Capitol Police stood there.
[03:28:01.517 --> 03:28:09.263]  But forever in history, they'll go with the same byline that five people were murdered at the January 6th event.
[03:28:09.263 --> 03:28:11.345]  It's ludicrous and we all know it.
[03:28:11.345 --> 03:28:12.446]  It's all for show.
[03:28:12.446 --> 03:28:14.248]  So how do we break through this?
[03:28:14.921 --> 03:28:24.268]  I'm going to show you a technique and convey a technique to you that we need to teach our kids and that we need to be doing every single day when we're reading news stories.
[03:28:24.268 --> 03:28:31.834]  And I hope this technique helps you when we come back, because this technique can be something that's so easy to teach.
[03:28:31.834 --> 03:28:33.615]  It's so easy!
[03:28:33.615 --> 03:28:35.317]  And when I come back, we'll get right to it.
[03:28:35.317 --> 03:28:36.998]  I'm Kate Dalley, your guest host.
[03:28:36.998 --> 03:28:39.160]  KateDalleyRadio.com.
[03:28:39.160 --> 03:28:43.523]  I'm actually live right after this for three hours, and so I hope you join me there, too.
[03:28:43.523 --> 03:28:44.364]  Be right back.
[03:28:55.731 --> 03:29:02.892]  Both of these amazing products have been sold out for almost half a year because of supply chain breakdowns.
[03:29:02.892 --> 03:29:06.553]  You've done a great job supporting InfoWars and supporting your immune system.
[03:29:06.553 --> 03:29:10.954]  The problem is, with all the COVID lockdowns, the Great Reset, we can't get these products in.
[03:29:10.954 --> 03:29:22.877]  So finally, they came in, but a limited run of our whole food, vitamin, mineral, essential, nutrient, multivitamins, so you absorb it, and so it's not toxic in your body, like synthetic vitamins.
[03:29:22.877 --> 03:29:24.577]  And then of course, vitamin C and zinc,
[03:29:25.037 --> 03:29:32.142]  This sucker is really full and heavy because it's a huge dose of vitamin C and zinc and rose hips.
[03:29:32.142 --> 03:29:35.644]  Number one thing you can do for your immune system and your body, and it does so much more.
[03:29:35.644 --> 03:29:40.467]  Both of these are now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com for 40% off.
[03:29:40.467 --> 03:29:43.389]  I'm going to keep them at that price until they sell out.
[03:29:43.389 --> 03:29:45.791]  Because of supply chain breakdowns, we've got a limited run.
[03:29:45.791 --> 03:29:49.673]  So please take action now and order them at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:29:49.673 --> 03:29:54.777]  But whatever you do, find similar products out there and use them because this is a life and death situation to be healthy.
[03:29:55.918 --> 03:29:57.239]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[03:29:57.239 --> 03:29:59.280]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[03:29:59.280 --> 03:29:59.680]  Welcome.
[03:29:59.680 --> 03:30:00.421]  Hello, Alex?
[03:30:00.421 --> 03:30:01.001]  Yes, Malcolm.
[03:30:01.001 --> 03:30:05.265]  All right, I'll make this quick and real short, where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[03:30:05.265 --> 03:30:09.868]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schroyer.
[03:30:09.868 --> 03:30:12.870]  Super male vitality and brain force plus.
[03:30:12.870 --> 03:30:15.512]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[03:30:15.752 --> 03:30:17.553]  Supermill Vitality really, really works.
[03:30:17.553 --> 03:30:29.219]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up, and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[03:30:29.219 --> 03:30:31.060]  This is like a very fine wine.
[03:30:31.060 --> 03:30:33.201]  In fact, each batch is different.
[03:30:33.201 --> 03:30:35.662]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[03:30:35.662 --> 03:30:38.924]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[03:30:38.924 --> 03:30:39.844]  That's just how it is.
[03:30:39.844 --> 03:30:40.505]  It's how it works.
[03:30:41.225 --> 03:30:43.146]  Uh, so, it's always good.
[03:30:43.146 --> 03:30:45.247]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[03:30:45.247 --> 03:30:49.050]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[03:30:55.620 --> 03:30:59.823]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in InfoWars Live products.
[03:30:59.823 --> 03:31:03.385]  And that's why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[03:31:03.385 --> 03:31:05.987]  And we could never get the ingredients again.
[03:31:05.987 --> 03:31:06.947]  Until now.
[03:31:06.947 --> 03:31:13.031]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[03:31:13.031 --> 03:31:16.794]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[03:31:16.794 --> 03:31:18.035]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[03:31:18.035 --> 03:31:22.818]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[03:31:23.218 --> 03:31:23.298]  It's
[03:31:39.892 --> 03:31:40.112]  I think so.
[03:31:56.047 --> 03:32:02.989]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[03:32:02.989 --> 03:32:08.870]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[03:32:08.870 --> 03:32:15.212]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[03:32:15.552 --> 03:32:22.780]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[03:32:22.780 --> 03:32:33.051]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[03:32:33.471 --> 03:32:42.474]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[03:32:42.474 --> 03:32:49.056]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[03:32:49.056 --> 03:32:55.258]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsTore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[03:32:57.648 --> 03:33:03.570]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:33:13.286 --> 03:33:14.707]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[03:33:14.707 --> 03:33:15.888]  Glad to be with you today.
[03:33:15.888 --> 03:33:19.330]  Let's talk about how to stop the brainwashing, shall we?
[03:33:19.330 --> 03:33:24.793]  Because I think we need some hints on what we can do to talk to our neighbors and friends and get them to see.
[03:33:24.793 --> 03:33:26.073]  Isn't that basically what we want?
[03:33:26.073 --> 03:33:29.976]  Because power in numbers is really the only thing that's going to work with us.
[03:33:29.976 --> 03:33:37.440]  The people are going to set this right, just like they've done in history many, many times.
[03:33:37.440 --> 03:33:41.482]  Did you know they tried to push a smallpox vaccine back in the 1800s?
[03:33:41.482 --> 03:33:42.403]  And guess who stopped it?
[03:33:43.220 --> 03:33:44.521]  The people.
[03:33:44.521 --> 03:33:47.402]  The people said, no, we will not do this.
[03:33:47.402 --> 03:33:48.843]  We don't need to do this.
[03:33:48.843 --> 03:33:50.483]  And they actually stopped it.
[03:33:50.483 --> 03:33:56.206]  That's how they had to kind of reinvent the vaccine program again in the 1900s is because in the 1800s they tried.
[03:33:58.260 --> 03:34:00.361]  But it's always going to be the force of the people.
[03:34:00.361 --> 03:34:09.943]  So let me give you a technique that works pretty well in trying to stop the propaganda and the brainwashing to get people to see what's going on in our news.
[03:34:09.943 --> 03:34:18.405]  Mainstream news will always have an article and the article will always have a paragraph and that first paragraph is really important.
[03:34:18.405 --> 03:34:22.626]  And this is the paragraph that you want to read and then you want to go through with your kids.
[03:34:23.326 --> 03:34:27.329]  So here's a paragraph about January 6th.
[03:34:27.329 --> 03:34:35.874]  Events on Thursday to mark a year since the January 6th riot at the Capitol underscored the fragility and uncertainty in America's future.
[03:34:35.874 --> 03:34:47.262]  Even President Biden blamed the deadly insurrection on former President Trump and a mob of extremist military or militia members and former military who embraced Trump's web of lies.
[03:34:47.262 --> 03:34:47.482]  Right?
[03:34:49.332 --> 03:34:51.955]  That's how it's always going to go down in history, right?
[03:34:51.955 --> 03:34:57.242]  That first paragraph, what it does is it lies down, it lays down, I'm sorry, an assumption.
[03:34:57.242 --> 03:34:59.585]  An assumption of what we believe.
[03:34:59.585 --> 03:35:03.470]  An assumption of what we have now assumed as truth.
[03:35:04.537 --> 03:35:09.982]  But if you pick apart the first paragraph and you go sentence by sentence and you ask, is that true?
[03:35:09.982 --> 03:35:10.783]  Is that true?
[03:35:10.783 --> 03:35:11.924]  Is that true?
[03:35:11.924 --> 03:35:15.887]  It's kind of amazing how the rest of the article falls apart.
[03:35:15.887 --> 03:35:26.197]  Every single news article depends on that first paragraph to show you the exact words that you're supposed to absorb and believe before you hit the rest of the article.
[03:35:26.940 --> 03:35:36.403]  So when you're with your kids, every single news article you read, you have to go to their assumption of fact and tear it apart.
[03:35:36.403 --> 03:35:37.643]  Was it deadly?
[03:35:37.643 --> 03:35:38.624]  No.
[03:35:38.624 --> 03:35:39.804]  Nobody was armed.
[03:35:39.804 --> 03:35:42.865]  And the Patriots actually didn't kill anybody.
[03:35:42.865 --> 03:35:44.045]  Okay?
[03:35:44.045 --> 03:35:47.987]  And did it underscore the fragility and uncertainty in America's future?
[03:35:47.987 --> 03:35:49.687]  Well, that depends.
[03:35:49.687 --> 03:35:55.349]  Are you saying that entire event now is the fragility and uncertainty in America's future?
[03:35:56.605 --> 03:35:58.586]  No, had nothing to do with it.
[03:35:58.586 --> 03:36:00.867]  They made a mountain out of a molehill.
[03:36:00.867 --> 03:36:04.108]  They tried to make something into something.
[03:36:04.108 --> 03:36:13.892]  So in every single article, and do this today, take three random articles from CNBC or ABC or any of the top hitters, you know, even Fox News and even CNN.
[03:36:14.910 --> 03:36:22.478]  Go to the first paragraph, tear it apart, and look for the assumptions that are made that are pretending to be a fact.
[03:36:22.478 --> 03:36:29.145]  And then you can start to roll back the propaganda and show somebody, okay, let's go after every word in this paragraph.
[03:36:29.145 --> 03:36:30.567]  Let's go after every sentence.
[03:36:30.567 --> 03:36:32.669]  Is what they are saying true?
[03:36:32.669 --> 03:36:34.691]  Because I'm going to doubt that it is.
[03:36:34.691 --> 03:36:36.393]  The rest of the article falls apart.
[03:36:37.157 --> 03:36:44.179]  Everything relies on that first paragraph to spell out the narrative for you so that you're not thinking.
[03:36:44.179 --> 03:36:54.501]  But if you critically think about the words and the sentences used, you'll start to be able to unwind the propaganda for somebody else as you're directing them through this.
[03:36:54.501 --> 03:36:56.181]  So, this happened in January 6.
[03:36:56.181 --> 03:36:58.782]  It's happening with Russia again, too.
[03:36:58.782 --> 03:37:05.443]  It always amazes me how we take these drumbeats of war and turn it into something huge, right?
[03:37:06.335 --> 03:37:08.476]  So, Russia, are we going to war?
[03:37:08.476 --> 03:37:10.137]  I don't think so.
[03:37:10.137 --> 03:37:11.979]  I think it'd be a small altercation.
[03:37:11.979 --> 03:37:20.544]  I think that Russia would like to have the Ukraine, but I don't think it's willing to take on some serious actions to do it.
[03:37:20.544 --> 03:37:22.885]  Is it really worth that much to have it?
[03:37:22.885 --> 03:37:23.666]  Right?
[03:37:23.666 --> 03:37:25.887]  To push all of these things to the edge.
[03:37:25.887 --> 03:37:28.289]  And if they do, would we be involved?
[03:37:28.289 --> 03:37:28.409]  No.
[03:37:29.286 --> 03:37:33.633]  But then again, we've been back here again in history so many times, haven't we?
[03:37:33.633 --> 03:37:36.458]  If we don't have the drumbeat of war, we can't do the war budgets.
[03:37:37.222 --> 03:37:40.103]  You know, we can't get the war budget maxed out.
[03:37:40.103 --> 03:37:44.486]  We, as an economy, are driven on a war budget.
[03:37:44.486 --> 03:37:52.049]  And so, as a Libertarian and as a Republican, I can tell you that I am not for the wars.
[03:37:52.049 --> 03:37:53.270]  It's all theater to me.
[03:37:53.270 --> 03:37:54.731]  The boogeymen are all theater.
[03:37:54.731 --> 03:37:59.253]  Remember when they used to roll out, we call him a king flung poo on the...
[03:38:01.814 --> 03:38:02.695]  On the show.
[03:38:02.695 --> 03:38:14.363]  You know, when they used to roll him out every few years as the biggest threat and they would say, you know, it's a nuclear threat, it's a nuclear threat to get everybody excited and everybody assuming that North Korea was going to drop a bomb on us.
[03:38:14.363 --> 03:38:15.243]  Did it ever happen?
[03:38:15.243 --> 03:38:15.484]  No.
[03:38:15.484 --> 03:38:18.185]  Do we have 600 times the firepower?
[03:38:18.185 --> 03:38:19.626]  Yes.
[03:38:19.626 --> 03:38:21.668]  Even if it would have happened, they would have never won.
[03:38:21.668 --> 03:38:26.231]  They would have never done anything to us because we would have been able to thwart that early on.
[03:38:26.920 --> 03:38:36.584]  So it's a problem for us when we can't see through the war, the war drum, the beat of that war drum every five minutes in America.
[03:38:36.584 --> 03:38:42.066]  When they want a good distraction, they start to, they start to tell us we're going to go to war again.
[03:38:42.066 --> 03:38:44.066]  I actually don't think we'll go to war over this.
[03:38:44.066 --> 03:38:49.328]  I think we'll actually, because I don't think we're ready or NATO's ready to go over war over Ukraine.
[03:38:49.328 --> 03:38:50.189]  Right?
[03:38:50.189 --> 03:38:51.089]  Why would be?
[03:38:51.089 --> 03:38:52.850]  Why would we be?
[03:38:52.850 --> 03:38:56.151]  And also, I think when you are looking at the narrative,
[03:38:57.088 --> 03:38:59.149]  It's all coming from Washington.
[03:38:59.149 --> 03:39:03.512]  And Washington loves to exaggerate and they love to come to assumptions.
[03:39:03.512 --> 03:39:11.016]  And when they do, they love to say the anonymous State Department person has now said that it's a possible attack.
[03:39:11.016 --> 03:39:12.597]  Yet Biden, what has he done?
[03:39:12.597 --> 03:39:15.739]  He said, well, possibly some sanctions.
[03:39:15.739 --> 03:39:21.583]  You know, he's already played his hand off the teleprompter, I have to add, because he doesn't know how to speak without a teleprompter.
[03:39:22.333 --> 03:39:27.657]  And we have a problem in identifying when we're being used and abused.
[03:39:27.657 --> 03:39:29.699]  And I think this is one of those moments.
[03:39:29.699 --> 03:39:32.441]  I actually don't think it's going to amount to too much.
[03:39:32.441 --> 03:39:36.204]  We're going to scaremonger this because it's a good distraction.
[03:39:36.204 --> 03:39:39.366]  But the truth is going to be very, very different, I think.
[03:39:39.366 --> 03:39:44.030]  And I also think that Russia might decide not to.
[03:39:45.030 --> 03:39:48.012]  Um, I just think it's a couple of kids on a playground right now.
[03:39:48.012 --> 03:39:51.995]  And I think that they're using it in the press to get us super excited about it.
[03:39:51.995 --> 03:39:55.017]  I actually do not think something will happen there.
[03:39:55.017 --> 03:39:56.298]  But, you know what?
[03:39:56.298 --> 03:39:59.760]  We're in a situation all the time where we have to see through these headlines.
[03:39:59.760 --> 03:40:05.764]  Do you remember in Syria when they tried to tell us that Assad was a mass murderer gassing his people all of a sudden?
[03:40:05.764 --> 03:40:07.765]  Right after we had him on 60 Minutes?
[03:40:07.765 --> 03:40:09.406]  And he was perfectly normal?
[03:40:09.406 --> 03:40:13.569]  You know, in the last few years, you really haven't heard about Assad gassing his people, have you?
[03:40:14.286 --> 03:40:14.907]  Hmm.
[03:40:14.907 --> 03:40:15.488]  Why not?
[03:40:15.488 --> 03:40:20.257]  Because it's not convenient for a storyline for the narrative.
[03:40:20.257 --> 03:40:26.147]  I guess madmen just become madmen and then all of a sudden, whoo, they're not madmen anymore.
[03:40:26.147 --> 03:40:26.868]  Hmm.
[03:40:26.868 --> 03:40:27.610]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:40:28.408 --> 03:40:38.780]  We tend to forget, because we have, I think, a certain amount of ADD in this country, where we're not able to reflect on the headline and look back and say, well, wait a second.
[03:40:38.780 --> 03:40:40.242]  This wasn't happening.
[03:40:40.242 --> 03:40:43.265]  This isn't something that was going on.
[03:40:43.265 --> 03:40:45.948]  And by the way, why did it just stop?
[03:40:45.948 --> 03:40:48.731]  Why are we no longer concerned about Assad gassing his people?
[03:40:49.392 --> 03:40:54.294]  I remember interviewing people on the ground in Syria and they were saying this is absolutely wrong.
[03:40:54.294 --> 03:40:57.376]  It's the white helmets are the bad guys, not the good guys.
[03:40:57.376 --> 03:41:00.157]  And of course, we actually elected Assad.
[03:41:00.157 --> 03:41:09.201]  And so we're always going to be told a story in our press that allows us to think that we're this close to having either World War III
[03:41:10.041 --> 03:41:22.287]  Or that we assume that a country is all of a sudden they have a madman and we have to go take them out, of course, to play ball so that we can insert somebody that we want to play ball with.
[03:41:22.287 --> 03:41:25.628]  But we're not taught to ask those questions.
[03:41:25.628 --> 03:41:26.849]  That's huge.
[03:41:26.849 --> 03:41:28.950]  The other problem I see is the focus.
[03:41:28.950 --> 03:41:31.131]  We are highly focused on COVID right now.
[03:41:32.088 --> 03:41:45.387]  And so the problem from coming from Dr. Robert Malone, which he laid out beautifully, was Robert Malone talked about the fact that this highly centered focus has been a brainwashing technique, a brainwashing technique.
[03:41:45.387 --> 03:41:48.972]  But how do you get through to people that are really kind of in a trance?
[03:41:49.901 --> 03:42:04.598]  And he said, you know, he said, really, the number one thing that you can do is present the bigger issue of the Great Reset, the bigger issue of losing liberty, the bigger issue that we have at hand, that we're going to lose freedom, and basically freedom for our kids.
[03:42:05.552 --> 03:42:20.296]  If you focus more on that, somebody that's in the trance as they're walking around, believing in COVID's going to kill me any second, a sniffle's coming to get me, might just be sort of jerked out of that trance into a higher level of thinking.
[03:42:20.296 --> 03:42:27.898]  And that would be, get them non-focused on COVID and focused on the degree of liberty that we're about to lose.
[03:42:27.898 --> 03:42:32.940]  It's another technique, just like going through the very first paragraph and picking it apart in a news article.
[03:42:33.380 --> 03:42:34.721]  Same kind of thing.
[03:42:34.721 --> 03:42:35.963]  We have to realize where we're at.
[03:42:35.963 --> 03:42:41.147]  So when I come back, I want to play a clip of Dr. David Martin talking about the beginning of COVID.
[03:42:41.147 --> 03:42:43.570]  The bigger story.
[03:42:43.570 --> 03:42:44.651]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[03:42:44.651 --> 03:42:45.271]  I'll be right back.
[03:42:56.494 --> 03:42:57.575]  Ride as one.
[03:42:57.575 --> 03:43:04.524]  Whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.
[03:43:04.524 --> 03:43:07.827]  We will follow the facts wherever they lead.
[03:43:07.827 --> 03:43:08.949]  Domestic terrorists.
[03:43:10.948 --> 03:43:13.650]  The days of independent media are numbered.
[03:43:13.650 --> 03:43:16.653]  The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[03:43:16.653 --> 03:43:19.535]  They are now debanking us behind the scenes.
[03:43:19.535 --> 03:43:22.398]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[03:43:22.398 --> 03:43:28.423]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps.
[03:43:28.423 --> 03:43:31.725]  The traitors know they can shut us down by force.
[03:43:31.725 --> 03:43:34.948]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[03:43:34.948 --> 03:43:35.469]  So be it.
[03:43:36.429 --> 03:43:38.831]  Make them silence us by force.
[03:43:38.831 --> 03:43:41.813]  This is the final battle of the information war.
[03:43:41.813 --> 03:43:43.094]  Give now.
[03:43:43.094 --> 03:43:44.615]  Buy products.
[03:43:44.615 --> 03:43:45.775]  Donate.
[03:43:45.775 --> 03:43:47.636]  Before everything changes.
[03:43:47.636 --> 03:43:50.478]  We need you to carry us through to the end.
[03:43:50.478 --> 03:43:51.839]  Victory or death.
[03:43:51.839 --> 03:43:53.680]  Go now to infowarestore.com
[03:43:55.905 --> 03:43:58.146]  Why do my enemies hate me so much?
[03:43:58.146 --> 03:43:59.727]  Why do the globalists hate you so much?
[03:43:59.727 --> 03:44:02.608]  Why do they hate America so much?
[03:44:02.608 --> 03:44:09.692]  Because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot coexist with.
[03:44:09.692 --> 03:44:10.973]  It's very, very simple.
[03:44:10.973 --> 03:44:22.839]  For their world government, their anti-human, post-human, eugenic system to flourish, freedom and liberty and due process and justice and God-fearing systems must fail.
[03:44:23.619 --> 03:44:26.161]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[03:44:26.161 --> 03:44:29.142]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[03:44:29.142 --> 03:44:31.083]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[03:44:31.083 --> 03:44:34.105]  They started a fight with you.
[03:44:34.105 --> 03:44:42.670]  And they're not gonna back down, and they're not gonna go away, and they're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of God put into them.
[03:44:43.290 --> 03:44:48.933]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order, or about globalism, or about corporate fascism.
[03:44:48.933 --> 03:44:54.537]  And it's not until people understand that, and that we're under attack, that we have any chance of beating these people.
[03:44:56.238 --> 03:45:03.166]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[03:45:03.166 --> 03:45:09.053]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[03:45:09.053 --> 03:45:15.420]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[03:45:15.740 --> 03:45:22.945]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[03:45:22.945 --> 03:45:33.233]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[03:45:33.653 --> 03:45:42.655]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[03:45:42.655 --> 03:45:49.236]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[03:45:49.236 --> 03:45:55.458]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.

[03:46:22.318 --> 03:46:25.959]  Then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[03:46:25.959 --> 03:46:32.481]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[03:46:32.481 --> 03:46:34.422]  It even tastes better than the last formula.
[03:46:34.422 --> 03:46:36.902]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[03:46:36.902 --> 03:46:38.283]  Again, it has that cutting edge.
[03:46:38.763 --> 03:46:44.345]  Chicken broth, protein, isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[03:46:44.345 --> 03:46:48.486]  You're gonna love this and what it does for your joints, what it does for your body, what it does for your bones.

[03:46:57.088 --> 03:47:02.970]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:11.573 --> 03:47:13.654]  Hi, happy to be back with you.
[03:47:13.654 --> 03:47:15.114]  I'm Kay Dally, your guest host.
[03:47:15.114 --> 03:47:19.476]  Happy to be here and talking about how to stop this brainwashing.
[03:47:19.476 --> 03:47:20.176]  What do we do?
[03:47:20.176 --> 03:47:21.096]  Are there techniques?
[03:47:21.096 --> 03:47:22.137]  What can we learn?
[03:47:22.137 --> 03:47:23.577]  What can we do about this?
[03:47:23.577 --> 03:47:24.337]  And yes, there are.
[03:47:24.337 --> 03:47:25.678]  Gladly.
[03:47:25.678 --> 03:47:29.459]  I'm so glad about this because, you know, I know you're worried about it.
[03:47:29.459 --> 03:47:30.419]  I'm worried about it.
[03:47:30.419 --> 03:47:35.921]  And we see far too many people under these weird delusions and they're doing weird things.
[03:47:35.921 --> 03:47:37.822]  And you think, where did common sense go?
[03:47:39.173 --> 03:47:40.474]  I know, it's insane, right?
[03:47:40.474 --> 03:47:43.057]  I'm living in an insane world.
[03:47:43.057 --> 03:47:50.624]  Well, when it comes to Russia, Bill Engdahl, a friend of mine, had some very interesting things to say about that.
[03:47:50.624 --> 03:47:54.948]  He said, you know, in their one-sided pursuit, kind of a different angle about what's going on with Russia.
[03:47:55.646 --> 03:48:10.190]  In their one-sided pursuit, their insane Agenda 2030 that they're doing, Zero Carbon Agenda, the King-Fraud-A-Lot administration and the EU are putting their industry on a deliberate road to destruction well before the end of this decade.
[03:48:11.045 --> 03:48:19.451]  And is this in turn driving the current NATO agenda towards Russia in Ukraine and Belarus and Armenia and now Kazakhstan?
[03:48:19.451 --> 03:48:34.882]  And if the NATO powers that be know that they will lack the depth in military-industrial infrastructure in the near future, do you think it would be better to provoke a possible war with Russia now to eliminate a potential resistor to their de-industrial agenda?
[03:48:35.422 --> 03:48:42.004]  Other than China, Russia holds the only potential to deal a devastating blow to NATO if provoked.
[03:48:42.004 --> 03:48:44.585]  He said there's an interesting paradox here.
[03:48:44.585 --> 03:48:57.050]  If NATO, the stance towards Russia and China, when measured clearly suicidal national green agenda economic policies of the USA, are as well as the EU, NATO states, right?
[03:48:57.050 --> 03:49:02.572]  This transformation of the economies of the world's most advanced industrial economies is underway and gaining momentum.
[03:49:03.132 --> 03:49:04.612]  Is this part of a bigger plan?
[03:49:04.612 --> 03:49:07.693]  Because is the heart of the transformation is energy.
[03:49:07.693 --> 03:49:10.374]  The absurd demand for zero carbon energy by 2050.
[03:49:10.374 --> 03:49:13.035]  I know, it's insane.
[03:49:13.035 --> 03:49:18.696]  To eliminate carbon from the energy industry is not at this time perhaps never possible.
[03:49:18.696 --> 03:49:23.618]  But with the push for it will mean tearing apart the world's most productive economies.
[03:49:23.618 --> 03:49:26.458]  Because some of this is based in nuclear, right?
[03:49:26.458 --> 03:49:26.938]  In nuclear.
[03:49:26.938 --> 03:49:27.839]  So keep that in mind.
[03:49:29.355 --> 03:49:38.117]  When we're talking about COVID and we're talking about kind of their master plan and everybody's focused on COVID, I want to play a clip for you from Dr. David Martin.
[03:49:38.117 --> 03:49:50.219]  This is a fantastic clip in really getting back to the basics of the bigger plan, what was at hand, and helping people to understand why we're in this mess and how long ago it started.
[03:49:50.219 --> 03:49:51.340]  Here's Dr. David Martin.
[03:49:54.243 --> 03:50:03.450]  In 2002, there was a recognition that the coronavirus was seen as an exploitable mechanism for both good and ill.
[03:50:03.450 --> 03:50:07.213]  On April the 25th, 2003, the U.S.
[03:50:07.213 --> 03:50:14.019]  Center for Disease Control filed a patent on the coronavirus transmitted to humans.
[03:50:14.019 --> 03:50:15.921]  Under 35 U.S.
[03:50:15.921 --> 03:50:20.925]  Code Section 101, nature is prohibited from being patented.
[03:50:22.026 --> 03:50:35.917]  Either SARS coronavirus was manufactured, therefore making a patent on it legal, or it was natural, therefore making a patent on it illegal.
[03:50:35.917 --> 03:50:43.963]  If it was manufactured, it was a violation of biological and chemical weapons, treaties, and laws.
[03:50:43.963 --> 03:50:47.887]  If it was natural, filing a patent on it was illegal.
[03:50:47.887 --> 03:50:50.769]  In either outcome, both are illegal.
[03:50:52.366 --> 03:51:01.910]  In the spring of 2007, the CDC filed a petition with the Patent Office to keep their application confidential and private.
[03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:09.134]  They actually filed patents on not only the virus, but they also filed patents on its detection and a kit to measure it.
[03:51:09.134 --> 03:51:20.079]  Because of that CDC patent, they had the ability to control who was authorized and who was not authorized to make independent inquiries into coronavirus.
[03:51:21.192 --> 03:51:23.173]  You cannot look at the virus.
[03:51:23.173 --> 03:51:24.594]  You cannot measure it.
[03:51:24.594 --> 03:51:27.715]  You cannot develop a test kit for it.
[03:51:27.715 --> 03:51:39.121]  And by ultimately receiving the patents that constrained anyone from using it, they had the means, they had the motive, and most of all, they had the monetary gain.
[03:51:40.387 --> 03:51:45.328]  From turning coronavirus from a pathogen to profit.
[03:51:45.328 --> 03:51:54.550]  Developing and owning a coronavirus vaccine has become a biotech arms race with political overtones.
[03:51:54.550 --> 03:51:57.310]  This vaccine gold rush is starting to bother me.
[03:51:57.310 --> 03:51:58.850]  Gold rush?
[03:51:58.850 --> 03:51:59.731]  Hmm.
[03:51:59.731 --> 03:52:01.131]  Keep that in mind.
[03:52:01.131 --> 03:52:03.511]  And so somewhere between 2012 and 2013, something happened.
[03:52:08.049 --> 03:52:18.372]  It's the federal funding for research that was feeding into places like Harvard, Emory, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.
[03:52:19.417 --> 03:52:33.003]  That funding suddenly became impaired by something that happened at the NIH, where the NIH got this little tiny moment of clarity and said, I think something we're doing is wrong.
[03:52:33.003 --> 03:52:41.067]  And in 2013, the NIH said, gain-of-function research on coronavirus should be suspended.
[03:52:41.067 --> 03:52:48.511]  The National Institutes of Health had a moral and social and potentially legal reason to object to research.
[03:52:49.571 --> 03:53:00.082]  But the letters that were sent to the researchers essentially said, you are receiving notice that we're telling you to stop.
[03:53:00.082 --> 03:53:05.727]  And now on the bottom of the page, we're going to clarify what stop means.
[03:53:05.727 --> 03:53:06.228]  Keep going.
[03:53:07.981 --> 03:53:13.845]  But when the heat gets hot in 2014 and 2015, what do you do?
[03:53:13.845 --> 03:53:15.786]  You offshore the research.
[03:53:15.786 --> 03:53:24.472]  You fund the Wuhan Institute of Virology to do the stuff that sounds like it's getting a little edgy with respect to its morality and legality.
[03:53:24.472 --> 03:53:25.993]  But do you do it straight away?
[03:53:25.993 --> 03:53:26.254]  No.
[03:53:27.054 --> 03:53:32.299]  You run the money through a series of cover organizations to make it look like you're funding a U.S.
[03:53:32.299 --> 03:53:36.122]  operation, which then subcontracts with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[03:53:36.122 --> 03:53:36.642]  The U.S.
[03:53:36.642 --> 03:53:38.664]  could say China did it.
[03:53:38.664 --> 03:53:40.085]  China could say the U.S.
[03:53:40.085 --> 03:53:40.686]  did it.
[03:53:40.686 --> 03:53:48.573]  And the cool thing is both of them are almost telling the truth.
[03:53:48.573 --> 03:53:50.114]  I love Dr. David Martin.
[03:53:50.114 --> 03:53:52.997]  Fantastic friend of mine and a truth teller.
[03:53:52.997 --> 03:53:53.577]  What can I say?
[03:53:53.577 --> 03:53:54.478]  He's wonderful.
[03:53:55.229 --> 03:54:04.034]  And really pointing out the time frame behind the plan for COVID-19.
[03:54:04.034 --> 03:54:07.015]  What people can't see are the bigger laid plans, right?
[03:54:07.015 --> 03:54:09.396]  We can see them because we do our homework and our research.
[03:54:09.396 --> 03:54:12.958]  You wouldn't be listening to this show if you hadn't.
[03:54:12.958 --> 03:54:15.479]  You can see it, like the wrestling match.
[03:54:15.479 --> 03:54:17.921]  You get to see that it's fixed.
[03:54:17.921 --> 03:54:20.182]  But how do we show other people that?
[03:54:20.182 --> 03:54:22.163]  We can go back and we can show them the history.
[03:54:22.785 --> 03:54:29.109]  They might be in a trance still, walking around like Frankenstein, but they might listen.
[03:54:29.109 --> 03:54:42.499]  And if we can go back enough in time and show them medical tyranny was planned for a very long time and the gain of function on coronavirus was planned and executed for two decades.
[03:54:42.499 --> 03:54:43.980]  That's huge.
[03:54:43.980 --> 03:54:47.902]  Then it shakes at its core the fact that we're in COVID-19 since March of 2020.
[03:54:49.252 --> 03:54:57.958]  Do you know this week marks the anniversary of the manufacturing of the vaccine two years ago?
[03:54:57.958 --> 03:54:59.239]  Wait a minute.
[03:54:59.239 --> 03:55:02.541]  The end of January they started manufacturing the vaccine?
[03:55:02.541 --> 03:55:05.883]  Well, according to Sarah Gilbert who works for Gates, yes.
[03:55:05.883 --> 03:55:11.927]  They already started manufacturing a cure for something they hadn't even named yet and wouldn't name until March.
[03:55:13.559 --> 03:55:23.865]  If you start to go back and show people these important messages, arguing about the mask, arguing about, because it's ridiculous, but arguing about it isn't going to help.
[03:55:23.865 --> 03:55:29.428]  They are going to be solely transfixed on the fact that they're saving somebody's life, as stupid as that is.
[03:55:29.428 --> 03:55:36.913]  But you and I have to go back and show them the history of the gain of function and who owned the patents on Corona.
[03:55:37.865 --> 03:55:42.788]  All the articles today are, the hospitals are at their limit and they're about to reach their limit.
[03:55:42.788 --> 03:55:45.229]  More importantly, always look at the wording.
[03:55:45.229 --> 03:55:46.690]  About to reach.
[03:55:46.690 --> 03:55:48.191]  Going to get there.
[03:55:48.191 --> 03:55:51.573]  The hospitals will be full, but they're not full.
[03:55:51.573 --> 03:55:55.755]  I interviewed Dr. Ben Carson the other day and he said something very insightful.
[03:55:55.755 --> 03:55:57.896]  I've worked in hospitals for a very long time.
[03:55:57.896 --> 03:55:59.157]  We're always at capacity.
[03:55:59.897 --> 03:56:03.980]  And then we're not, and then we are, and then we're not through time.
[03:56:03.980 --> 03:56:11.085]  All the decades that he worked at hospitals, he can tell you that hospitals were full all of the time, and then they weren't full.
[03:56:11.085 --> 03:56:16.088]  This is nothing new, but they're playing on people's fears that this is something new, right?
[03:56:16.088 --> 03:56:17.709]  Always reinventing the story.
[03:56:18.289 --> 03:56:21.411]  This has been rebranded four times in nine months.
[03:56:21.411 --> 03:56:24.852]  And now we've got the new moronic variant shot coming out.
[03:56:24.852 --> 03:56:25.472]  Why?
[03:56:25.472 --> 03:56:28.634]  Because they couldn't name it booster shot number five.
[03:56:28.634 --> 03:56:29.534]  That's why.
[03:56:29.534 --> 03:56:31.295]  People are getting a little weary of it.
[03:56:31.295 --> 03:56:38.998]  And so right now they're laying down all the articles, all of the news press releases from Israel saying, hey, oh, four isn't enough.
[03:56:38.998 --> 03:56:40.659]  We're hit by this Omicron.
[03:56:40.659 --> 03:56:42.680]  There's no test for Omicron.
[03:56:42.680 --> 03:56:46.702]  You're taking the same COVID test you did a year ago.
[03:56:46.702 --> 03:56:46.942]  Okay?
[03:56:47.734 --> 03:56:56.417]  There's no test for it, and just because the government and the CDC come out with a label and diagnose you with something, doesn't mean you assume you have it.
[03:56:56.417 --> 03:56:57.238]  It's ridiculous.
[03:56:57.238 --> 03:56:59.198]  It's the repackaging of symptoms.
[03:56:59.198 --> 03:57:02.100]  It's the repackaging of COVID over and over.
[03:57:02.100 --> 03:57:03.100]  And what is COVID?
[03:57:03.100 --> 03:57:07.622]  The repackaging of the flu, of colds, and of zinc.
[03:57:07.622 --> 03:57:11.043]  I mean, I'm sorry, not of zinc, of flu, the colds, and pneumonia.
[03:57:11.809 --> 03:57:14.332]  The taste and smell component that everybody's so afraid of?
[03:57:14.332 --> 03:57:20.017]  Just take a hundred zinc every day for a while until your taste and smell comes back.
[03:57:20.017 --> 03:57:21.399]  This is not rocket science.
[03:57:21.399 --> 03:57:24.602]  We have got to unwind the propaganda, says Pat Wood.
[03:57:24.602 --> 03:57:28.205]  Unwind the propaganda because propaganda is what got us into this.
[03:57:28.205 --> 03:57:29.547]  There are ways to do this.
[03:57:30.419 --> 03:57:31.701]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[03:57:31.701 --> 03:57:32.763]  I'm glad you've joined me.
[03:57:32.763 --> 03:57:41.836]  There's more on this at katedallyradio.com and I show clips about this, but we have got to start to train people how to do this and overlook the and look at the propaganda.
[03:57:41.836 --> 03:57:42.357]  Thanks, you guys.
[03:57:48.238 --> 03:57:56.981]  I just want to reach out and give a recommendation to Reset Wars.
[03:57:56.981 --> 03:57:57.942]  It's really powerful.
[03:57:57.942 --> 03:58:03.384]  Reset Wars was absolutely amazing and eye opening and revolutionary.
[03:58:03.584 --> 03:58:08.510]  If you want to change your life for the better, I highly recommend this to Alex.
[03:58:08.510 --> 03:58:10.833]  Thank you very much for putting the course together.
[03:58:10.833 --> 03:58:12.796]  I found it to be awesome.
[03:58:12.796 --> 03:58:14.037]  It was worth it to me.
[03:58:14.037 --> 03:58:19.865]  You have taken ancient wisdom and ancient knowledge and crystallized it with science.
[03:58:20.836 --> 03:58:22.357]  This isn't about Alex Jones.
[03:58:22.357 --> 03:58:34.706]  So what you're about to see is a lengthy, powerful, well-documented spectrum of information and experiences and understanding that the power structure is censoring and is deathly afraid of.
[03:58:34.706 --> 03:58:37.828]  To think the way we were intended to think by God.
[03:58:37.828 --> 03:58:39.669]  That's what this series is about.
[03:58:39.669 --> 03:58:44.193]  Reset Wars has been a great tool during this time of uncertainty and it has rejuvenated
[03:58:44.993 --> 03:58:46.575]  My hope.
[03:58:46.575 --> 03:58:50.258]  It's been helping me a lot with a lot that's going on in my life.
[03:58:50.258 --> 03:58:55.463]  Everybody needs to purchase this product and watch it and then share the information far and wide.
[03:58:55.463 --> 03:58:57.344]  There is an awakening.
[03:58:57.344 --> 03:59:01.728]  Join in to help yourself and others to wake up.
[03:59:01.728 --> 03:59:06.192]  ResetWorks has been a great tool in both recapping what I've come to already know
[03:59:07.353 --> 03:59:09.135]  And also learn new material.
[03:59:09.135 --> 03:59:10.195]  I'm not disappointed.
[03:59:10.195 --> 03:59:12.657]  I plan on sharing it with as many people as possible.
[03:59:12.657 --> 03:59:14.819]  I hear you coming more and more with that.
[03:59:14.819 --> 03:59:16.280]  And I feel it more and more.
[03:59:16.280 --> 03:59:17.421]  It's moving me.
[03:59:17.421 --> 03:59:21.084]  We need to have courage and focus in order to accomplish that mission.
[03:59:21.084 --> 03:59:24.407]  And I felt like I got a lot of that from Reset Wars as well.
[03:59:24.407 --> 03:59:28.030]  The confidence and hope gained from Reset Wars is priceless.
[03:59:28.590 --> 03:59:29.951]  This isn't magic.
[03:59:29.951 --> 03:59:37.614]  This is the real code of the universe, or what Max Planck 120 plus years ago called the Matrix.
