[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:05.212]  And it was this broadcast that exposed us into 2030, and into 2021.
[00:00:05.252 --> 00:00:08.514]  It was this broadcast more than any other, and it's not about the credit.
[00:00:09.294 --> 00:00:18.659]  It's about realizing how important this operation is, and looking in the mirror every morning, myself, this crew, the listeners, and all the supporters, to understand just how important we are.
[00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:28.164]  And we've got to live up to this tall challenge that God's given us, but a challenge with God's help that we can win in this fight.
[00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:32.989]  It chills when I say that because we're the best there is.
[00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:34.490]  That doesn't mean we're that good.
[00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.391]  Doesn't mean we're perfect.
[00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:36.812]  Doesn't mean we think we're awesome.
[00:00:37.152 --> 00:00:38.794]  It just means we're the best there is.
[00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:40.635]  We're the best there is!
[00:00:41.436 --> 00:00:42.497]  The best there is!
[00:00:43.117 --> 00:00:44.178]  The best there is!
[00:00:44.478 --> 00:00:44.879]  We're it!
[00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.590]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.590]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.590]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:30.590]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:01:23.474 --> 00:01:25.576]  It's Wednesday, November 30th.
[00:01:25.796 --> 00:01:26.436]  The year is 2022.
[00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:29.698]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:33.760]  We went back 15 years ago.
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.921]  I might play air raid sirens once a year.
[00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:42.265]  Starting about a year and a half ago, I began to play them almost every day as a symbol of the fact that humanity is under attack.
[00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:47.469]  The entire global economy is being artificially turned off.
[00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:48.429]  That's the Great Reset.
[00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:49.390]  That's their own admission.
[00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.652]  They call it a great transformation.
[00:01:52.112 --> 00:02:06.764]  We have hundreds of clips of the head of the IMF, the head of the World Bank, the head of the Federal Reserve, the head of the WAF, the head of the United Nations, the head of the Commerce Department, the head of the Transportation Department, the head of the Energy Department, all saying the same thing.
[00:02:07.124 --> 00:02:08.485]  The British Prime Minister is saying it.
[00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:10.647]  All of them.
[00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:13.111]  They are cutting your energy off.
[00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:15.757]  They are training you can't leave your house unless they say so.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.046]  They're training you for the world ID card that will...
[00:02:21.095 --> 00:02:26.900]  Have a forced cashless society on central bank digital currencies that will control every facet of your life.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.227]  This is the big enchilada that I keep hammering, and thanks to this broadcast, that means you, the listeners and viewers, I thank you.
[00:02:34.247 --> 00:02:35.468]  I want that to burn in.
[00:02:36.328 --> 00:02:41.253]  It's now the top talking point by the resistance worldwide, and people aren't just accepting this.
[00:02:42.234 --> 00:02:45.356]  And it was this broadcast that exposed us into 2030.
[00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.611]  It was this broadcast more than any other, and it's not about the credit.
[00:02:51.412 --> 00:03:00.795]  It's about realizing how important this operation is, and looking in the mirror every morning, myself, this crew, the listeners, and all the supporters, to understand just how important we are.
[00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:10.278]  And we've got to live up to this tall challenge that God's given us, but a challenge with God's help that we can win in this fight.
[00:03:10.978 --> 00:03:15.092]   It chills when I say that because We're the best there is.
[00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:16.593]  That doesn't mean we're that good.
[00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:17.473]  Doesn't mean we're perfect.
[00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:18.913]  Doesn't mean we think we're awesome.
[00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:20.894]  It just means we're the best there is.
[00:03:21.514 --> 00:03:22.734]  We're the best there is!
[00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:24.575]  The best there is!
[00:03:25.215 --> 00:03:26.255]  The best there is!
[00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:27.036]  We're it!
[00:03:28.916 --> 00:03:30.477]  We're not going to sit on the sidelines.
[00:03:30.497 --> 00:03:31.477]  We're not going to back down.
[00:03:31.497 --> 00:03:32.297]  We're not going to roll over.
[00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:33.637]  We're going to fight harder than ever.
[00:03:33.678 --> 00:03:35.058]  What matters is the message.
[00:03:36.434 --> 00:03:39.097]  And getting this transmission out and keeping it on air.
[00:03:39.598 --> 00:03:54.394]  And that means the people that spread the word, the people that buy the products, and the people that pray for this broadcast are absolutely the heart of the resistance, the tip of the spear, the blood and guts, the brains, the eyes, the ears, the skin, the mind, the soul.
[00:03:56.354 --> 00:04:00.238]  of the pro-human liberty system that we are launching.
[00:04:00.658 --> 00:04:09.066]  Renaissance 2.0 against the New World Order's Great Reset and their nightmare New Dark Age depopulation technotronic technocracy era.
[00:04:10.708 --> 00:04:12.029]  So much huge news today.
[00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:13.451]  We're going to hit it all when we come back.
[00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:15.653]  Some stations don't carry the first segment of the hour.
[00:04:15.793 --> 00:04:17.615]  They join us and I'm going to hit it all.
[00:04:17.655 --> 00:04:18.816]  There is just so much.
[00:04:19.436 --> 00:04:20.718]  But I wanted to just throw this out there.
[00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:27.881]  We had a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff go on, a lot of sabotage, a lot of attempts to shut us down, a lot of vendors not supply us.
[00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:31.542]  Not just supply chain breakdowns the last few years, but because of you, we held on.
[00:04:32.542 --> 00:04:35.823]  And we have gotten a lot better shipping deal.
[00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:38.624]  And so shipping prices are going to go way, way, way down.
[00:04:38.684 --> 00:04:40.064]  It's the most competitive in the country.
[00:04:40.564 --> 00:04:41.704]  And that's on orders below $50.
[00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:45.906]  All orders above $50 now, back to free shipping.
[00:04:46.506 --> 00:04:48.326]  So that is the new special.
[00:04:48.826 --> 00:04:50.267]  And we're at least able to run this.
[00:04:51.434 --> 00:04:57.141]  Through Christmas and we'll still on a routine basis be able to offer free shipping probably in perpetuity.
[00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:58.543]  We've got to gauge it though.
[00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:01.647]  And make sure enough funds are coming in.
[00:05:01.687 --> 00:05:08.509]  But that's been the biggest complaint we've got is that the free shipping went away and that some of the shipping prices went up and that was not on our end.
[00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:12.750]  That was some of the stuff we went through because we're in full wars.
[00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.071]  But now, for the grace of God, we have gotten way better supplement suppliers.
[00:05:18.612 --> 00:05:19.892]  They're the exact same supplements.
[00:05:19.912 --> 00:05:23.313]  We've just gone right to where they actually, the two groups actually get produced by.
[00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:31.532]   and so we're now able to get 95% curcuminoid turmeric for example for 42%
[00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:36.653]   less than we were getting it from the actual supplier. That's just one of the
[00:05:36.653 --> 00:05:41.133]   behind-the-scenes things. I've been working my butt off so is my crew and
[00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:45.333]   we've really that which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger and so we've
[00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:48.933]   gotten just a lot of new things finally that are gonna be launching the next
[00:05:48.933 --> 00:05:53.253]   week but the first big part of it right now is the free shipping back at
[00:05:53.253 --> 00:05:58.533]   infowarestore.com on order $50 or more stay with us. All right let me tell you
[00:05:58.533 --> 00:06:02.293]  what's coming up in the next four hours today.
[00:06:01.157 --> 00:06:03.178]  Number one, I've cleared the decks of guests.
[00:06:03.638 --> 00:06:07.600]  We're going to open the phones up throughout the next four hours, starting later in this hour.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.400]  That's number one.
[00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:11.742]  Any issue, any topic, I love the wildcard nature of it.
[00:06:12.262 --> 00:06:16.924]  First-time callers, long-time callers, callers that agree, callers that disagree, it'll be a free-for-all.
[00:06:17.224 --> 00:06:19.325]  Coming up, bottom of the hour, I will give the number out.
[00:06:19.886 --> 00:06:20.146]  Okay.
[00:06:21.127 --> 00:06:26.490]  That said, let me go through all the news, then we're going to go through each tranche of it in detail.
[00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:32.934]  Project Veritas has knocked another one out of the park, and it's so key what they've done.
[00:06:33.614 --> 00:06:43.560]  It's one thing to have a Senate report from eight years ago that Obama knowingly placed tens of thousands of children with sex traffickers and pedophiles.
[00:06:44.741 --> 00:06:55.168]   That's a bipartisan Senate report, headline Washington Post, Senate report Confirms Obama placed migrant children with pedophiles child smugglers.
[00:06:55.208 --> 00:06:55.768]  That's the headline.
[00:06:56.348 --> 00:06:57.169]  One thing to have a headline.
[00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:59.831]  One thing to have the government report.
[00:06:59.851 --> 00:07:06.315]  Another thing to have InfoWars go down last year and this year and the year before and show the children being smuggled across.
[00:07:08.243 --> 00:07:14.147]  The last two years under Biden and being given directly to the child smugglers with no paperwork.
[00:07:14.187 --> 00:07:17.750]  We showed that and the controlled corporate press was basically able to suppress it.
[00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.231]  The most incredible footage ever.
[00:07:19.592 --> 00:07:21.333]  Undercover police we had inside.
[00:07:21.673 --> 00:07:23.615]  I mean just serious investigation stuff.
[00:07:23.875 --> 00:07:25.136]  Should have been top story in the country.
[00:07:25.436 --> 00:07:26.397]  Should have touched our hearts.
[00:07:26.417 --> 00:07:27.217]  Should have changed the world.
[00:07:28.458 --> 00:07:30.600]  Was big in the alternative independent media.
[00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:33.019]  zero coverage nationally.
[00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:36.778]  Went on and on and on.
[00:07:36.778 --> 00:07:38.419]  But Veritas is smart.
[00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:42.099]   They didn't just track them to the airports and the bus stations, including newborn babies
[00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:48.419]   and six-month-old babies being loaded without their mothers onto vehicles and onto planes
[00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:51.500]  to complete strangers with no paperwork.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:58.378]   Project Veritas tracked it from the Texas border to Austin, Texas, and then now more reports
[00:07:58.378 --> 00:08:06.098]   are coming out beyond with the people literally advertising they have small children for sale for sex.
[00:08:06.098 --> 00:08:16.098]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:08:07.328 --> 00:08:26.059]   Remember when Project Veritas first bust on the scene 10 years ago or so and James O'Keefe dressed in a classic pimp outfit from the 70s walks in with an underage girl to a Democrat Office in a black neighborhood and says I'm here to sell this hoe Help me set it up.
[00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:26.579]  They go.
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.120]  Absolutely.
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:49.565]   We'll help you set up a front company and everything as long as you run the cash through us All on hidden camera Okay, so this this is who they are this is how they operate this is what they do, okay We have footage of men chasing the female cop out because she's a little lady and They think they can intimidate her.
[00:08:49.605 --> 00:09:03.713]  She's inside the center down there in South Texas in McAllen and the man confronts her.
[00:09:04.214 --> 00:09:05.455]  Our security people go up to him.
[00:09:06.408 --> 00:09:10.129]  And he says, what is she doing in there trying to stop me getting these women and their children?
[00:09:10.629 --> 00:09:13.050]  I'm going to teach them the way of the Lord in Pennsylvania.
[00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.270]  They're going to work for me.
[00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.471]  I don't want women that have men with them or husbands or sons.
[00:09:17.631 --> 00:09:19.331]  I want women and their children.
[00:09:19.971 --> 00:09:21.272]  I want the little girls.
[00:09:24.732 --> 00:09:31.594]  And we have video of them giving the children to men in vans and to men and women at airports with no paperwork.
[00:09:32.998 --> 00:09:53.175]  But now Project Veritas has the smuggled children as young as 4, 6, 8, 10 being trafficked and being given to Democrat Party operatives who then pimp them out.
[00:09:53.195 --> 00:09:56.278]  10-year-old, 11-year-old, 12-year-old girls.
[00:09:58.559 --> 00:09:59.320]  Children as young as 6.
[00:10:00.987 --> 00:10:02.848]  That's the New World Order.
[00:10:04.048 --> 00:10:08.590]  That's not fashion lines promoting pedophilia.
[00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:18.435]  That's not top Democrat spiritual leaders promoting Aleister Crowley sex magic.
[00:10:20.396 --> 00:10:39.576]   That's not John Podesta's brother, Tony Podesta, in the Washington Post in a headline, the dangerous art Of Tony Podesta showing little two-year-old boys tied up and being sexually tortured.
[00:10:43.238 --> 00:10:48.740]  This is the actual children smuggled from Mexico to Austin and beyond.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.501]  And you see this woman on screen right here.
[00:10:51.161 --> 00:10:54.423]  We tracked her in four different trips over the last two years.
[00:10:55.402 --> 00:11:15.516]  From the so-called Catholic Charities and other charities that are just leftist front groups down there, to the airport where she hands six-month-old and ten-month-old babies to women and men with no IDs, no paperwork, and she says to the TSA, yes, this is my baby.
[00:11:16.937 --> 00:11:18.378]  They don't see any ID, they don't see any proof.
[00:11:18.398 --> 00:11:19.159]  They go, is this your baby?
[00:11:19.219 --> 00:11:19.619]  It's my baby.
[00:11:19.819 --> 00:11:23.242]  And then she hands it to a woman who then just disappears with it onto a plane.
[00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:24.623]  Now, there's footage of it right there.
[00:11:26.656 --> 00:11:31.841]  And she does it all day long, just delivers kids that are just dumped over.
[00:11:31.981 --> 00:11:44.433]  No IDs, no information on the kids, just a packet they give TSA saying, I'm going to Chicago, or I'm going to Philadelphia, or I'm going to New York, or I'm going to Austin, Texas, or I'm going to Miami.
[00:11:47.496 --> 00:11:57.255]   Now Project Veritas, Has now gotten the footage of the sex trafficking and the girls being pimped on the streets.
[00:11:57.715 --> 00:11:58.735]  And this is only part one.
[00:11:59.896 --> 00:12:02.256]  And Project Veritas always tops itself.
[00:12:02.696 --> 00:12:07.917]  And they've done so much it's hard to say what their biggest... These little boys talking about being sex trafficked.
[00:12:08.917 --> 00:12:09.777]  Five, six year old boys.
[00:12:11.378 --> 00:12:14.438]  They say, oh I have a fake father I live with and he does this to me.
[00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:17.119]  Poor little angels.
[00:12:18.317 --> 00:12:19.979]  Oh, but Elon Musk is going to talk about that.
[00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:28.826]  He's too busy saying, I need to be thrown in the ocean and killed because I hurt the children by questioning a shooting, thinking maybe this criminal group might stage something.
[00:12:29.286 --> 00:12:30.568]  But they've staged so much before.
[00:12:30.588 --> 00:12:36.393]  And I'll continue to question wars and WMDs and Jussie Smollett, you name it.
[00:12:37.834 --> 00:12:41.357]  I wish the devil's champion Elon Musk would get on board with this.
[00:12:41.377 --> 00:12:50.485]   But regardless, the point is, This is human trafficking, and they're going into sex slavery.
[00:12:52.466 --> 00:13:00.572]  And they also signed the kids up under all these different names, and they get all this different welfare money, and then part of that's paid to Democrat Party law firms.
[00:13:01.153 --> 00:13:02.934]  They busted the brother.
[00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:22.658]  Almost a decade ago, of the mayor in Austin, in his three-story house, with a giant underground secret dungeon, with illegal aliens in cages, some of the miners who they were holding captive until their families paid more money, because they think they're being robbed by coyotes, by smugglers.
[00:13:23.419 --> 00:13:25.420]  And over the years, the amount's gone from $500 to $1,000 to $3,000 to $4,000.
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.460]  For Chinese to get here, it's up to $50,000.
[00:13:30.402 --> 00:13:42.749]  And then they get as far as Austin or San Antonio, and if they don't pay up, they put them in an 18-wheeler and drive them and park them in the sun in the middle of nowhere till they all die of heat exposure.
[00:13:43.849 --> 00:13:44.850]  Boiling alive.
[00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.911]  That's why every few weeks you hear about another 18-wheeler full of dead people.
[00:13:48.231 --> 00:13:49.492]  They're being executed.
[00:13:49.512 --> 00:13:54.355]  That way you don't get your hands on it for any DNA evidence.
[00:13:54.395 --> 00:13:58.949]   You're just loaded in the back, taken out, Family didn't pay the extra money?
[00:13:59.069 --> 00:14:02.953]  You are dead, dead, dead, dead.
[00:14:03.113 --> 00:14:04.254]  But it's liberal!
[00:14:05.835 --> 00:14:24.151]  And then, people that are heavily involved in the globalist operations, filmmakers, like the guy that made Machete Kills, shows white people at the Texas border, played by Don Johnson, shooting pregnant Hispanic women and saying they hate Mexicans.
[00:14:27.791 --> 00:14:28.371]  All made up!
[00:14:29.072 --> 00:14:44.938]  But when the Hispanics, literally working with the Deep State, are trafficking Hispanic children, Hispanic women, and Hispanic men, and treating them worse than slaves, killing them, raping them, it's liberal!
[00:14:45.478 --> 00:14:46.439]  It's cute!
[00:14:46.999 --> 00:14:47.819]  It's sweet!
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:15:08.158]   Why doesn't Robert Rodriguez, who by the way was raised by a white family, is basically A white Texan, by culture, gets paid money first by the Obama administration on record to create racial division between whites and Hispanics.
[00:15:08.918 --> 00:15:09.658]  We'll get along great.
[00:15:10.098 --> 00:15:10.739]  Everybody knows that.
[00:15:11.479 --> 00:15:12.779]  These people are sick!
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.760]  These people are evil!
[00:15:17.472 --> 00:15:18.912]  And I am pissed and I'm tired of it!
[00:15:19.112 --> 00:15:23.554]  I want these people arrested by the governor and by the Texas Rangers yesterday!
[00:15:24.314 --> 00:15:28.095]  And then I want the Democratic Party officials part of it indicted by the states!
[00:15:28.915 --> 00:15:30.235]  Indicted now!
[00:15:30.255 --> 00:15:32.736]  I am sick of this crap!
[00:15:33.656 --> 00:15:35.497]  These are human beings this is being done to!
[00:15:35.517 --> 00:15:36.437]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:37.217 --> 00:15:45.733]   Welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the broadcast that evil There's not one on air, but it's on air thanks to your action and support.
[00:15:46.234 --> 00:15:47.234]  I salute you and thank you.
[00:15:47.574 --> 00:15:49.595]  Always keep that in mind, how important you are.
[00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:56.319]  All right, I said I would tell you what was coming up, and then I launched into that one story that I'll get back into next segment.
[00:15:56.819 --> 00:15:58.100]  I'll give the number out and take your calls.
[00:16:00.396 --> 00:16:07.819]  If you want to stop the illegals being brought in, and the human smuggling, and the trafficking of children, and the sex slavery, you have to arrest the smugglers.
[00:16:08.359 --> 00:16:14.161]  You have to arrest the Democrat Party politicians in the Soros-run cities that are running it and controlling it.
[00:16:14.501 --> 00:16:15.261]  It's so easy.
[00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:16.942]  You start indicting them, it's over.
[00:16:18.502 --> 00:16:25.845]  The problem is, over a thousand cities and towns are under the complete control of George Soros-elected officials.
[00:16:26.758 --> 00:16:32.341]  Like the kangaroo court judge that found me guilty and is trying to shut down InfoWars here in Austin.
[00:16:34.142 --> 00:16:36.023]  And think of all the other crimes they're able to commit.
[00:16:36.103 --> 00:16:41.585]  They let armed robbers that shoot at police in Austin out of jail the next day.
[00:16:43.026 --> 00:16:48.649]  In Fort Worth, remember a few months ago, they have a George Soros DA.
[00:16:49.289 --> 00:16:54.192]  And a young 16-year-old black man shot four students in cold blood, critically injuring them.
[00:16:55.052 --> 00:16:56.153]  He was out the next day.
[00:16:57.585 --> 00:17:01.047]  We have shootings in downtown Austin where bullets are sprayed into crowds.
[00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:06.131]  The George Soros operatives let them out of jail.
[00:17:08.432 --> 00:17:10.594]  But it's not just the low-level criminals they let out.
[00:17:10.754 --> 00:17:17.738]  It's the cover for the crime so bad you don't notice all the human smuggling and fentanyl and drug dealing.
[00:17:18.058 --> 00:17:24.583]  The Democratic Party, just as Nancy Pelosi said, is allied with MS-13, one of the most vicious gangs on earth.
[00:17:24.803 --> 00:17:26.244]  She called them God's children.
[00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:33.390]  And they are allied with these criminal gangs, and they are turning us into a third world country.
[00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:34.371]  I'm going to get back into that.
[00:17:35.271 --> 00:17:37.192]  Also, the real estate bubble has popped.
[00:17:37.653 --> 00:17:38.553]  It's starting to be announced.
[00:17:38.713 --> 00:17:39.113]  It's huge.
[00:17:39.133 --> 00:17:39.674]  We'll get to that.
[00:17:40.955 --> 00:17:42.976]  We've got a lot of new FTX news.
[00:17:43.096 --> 00:17:48.379]  Also, third crypto boss dies in just the last few weeks after Russian billionaire's helicopter crashes.
[00:17:48.699 --> 00:17:49.479]  What does that really mean?
[00:17:49.499 --> 00:17:50.220]  We're going to tie that in.
[00:17:51.391 --> 00:18:07.261]  We're going to look at the huge news of not just Google, not just Apple, not just Twitter in the past, but other big tech companies working with Xi Jinping to suppress his population, and how communist China has been giving the code keys to Apple software and to all Apple devices.
[00:18:08.061 --> 00:18:10.823]  That Apple users have, and that's now mainstream news.
[00:18:11.123 --> 00:18:13.904]  We told you about it years ago, but now it's breaking really big.
[00:18:14.044 --> 00:18:21.948]  And Trudeau in Canada is criticizing the crackdown on protesters when he did the exact same thing in Canada to peaceful protesters.
[00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:24.010]  That stack of key news.
[00:18:24.839 --> 00:18:31.558]   is coming up. Then we have a huge stack of new COVID tyranny rollouts. Now they're hyping up
[00:18:31.558 --> 00:18:38.919]   new lockdowns and new poison shots. Oathkeeper Stuart Rhodes guilty of seditious conspiracy.
[00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:44.279]   I tracked the trial. I read a lot of the transcripts. They had no evidence.
[00:18:44.481 --> 00:18:45.582]  Stuart Rhodes did nothing.
[00:18:45.622 --> 00:18:46.823]  None of his crew did anything.
[00:18:47.163 --> 00:18:48.123]  It was all lies.
[00:18:48.764 --> 00:18:50.545]  And another kangaroo D.C.
[00:18:50.565 --> 00:19:00.170]  jury found he and one other person guilty for the first time in decades of anybody's been found guilty of seditious conspiracy with absolutely no proof.
[00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:07.173]  The jury found him guilty because Stuart admitted the prosecutors are now saying this.
[00:19:07.213 --> 00:19:08.134]  So are the defense lawyers.
[00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:20.113]   He admitted proudly that if there was martial law and that if Antifa started occupying buildings and burning things down and trying to kill Republicans that they thought they'd be called up by the President.
[00:19:20.653 --> 00:19:22.894]  The Democrats have put us into that whole martial law atmosphere.
[00:19:23.354 --> 00:19:25.534]  And Rhodes set that on air, he said that everywhere.
[00:19:25.774 --> 00:19:26.955]  He never planned anything.
[00:19:27.155 --> 00:19:28.795]  He planned to defensively protect people.
[00:19:30.375 --> 00:19:37.597]  But the jury's now talking to the press and saying, well, we found him guilty because he admitted that he was there in case there was an Antifa uprising to fight back.
[00:19:42.136 --> 00:19:45.420]  Everything they charged him with is stuff he said on air.
[00:19:46.161 --> 00:19:51.387]  And he was very truthful, and got up there and told the truth, and they found him guilty of a non-crime.
[00:19:54.636 --> 00:19:56.837]  So he's now a political prisoner, officially.
[00:19:57.397 --> 00:19:58.077]  That's coming up.
[00:19:58.877 --> 00:20:05.460]  Big news unfolding in Ukraine and Russia and the energy wars, not just the physical war going on there.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:11.122]  Also a bunch of headlines out today by Yahoo News and others, how anti-Semitism became an American crisis.
[00:20:11.782 --> 00:20:14.983]  And I'm going to tell you how it became a crisis, coming up as well.
[00:20:15.003 --> 00:20:16.084]  But it's real simple.
[00:20:16.124 --> 00:20:25.624]   When you have the Democratic Party run around and say that inherently all white people are bad, and being a certain race is evil, which is completely Race-baiting and racist and Hitlerian.
[00:20:26.665 --> 00:20:34.729]  When the Democrats in Hollywood did that, then particularly a lot of minority groups went, okay, well then we say the Jews are bad.
[00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:40.333]  You shouldn't say all white people are bad, all black people are bad, all Hispanics or Asians are bad.
[00:20:40.553 --> 00:20:42.774]  We know Xi Jinping's bad doesn't mean all Chinese are bad.
[00:20:44.455 --> 00:20:51.731]   But by introducing that idea that inherently white people are bad, And they've got to pay reparations.
[00:20:52.052 --> 00:20:59.259]  You've introduced this racist idea to punish somebody for what color they are, the opposite of what Martin Luther King talked about that was totally true.
[00:20:59.599 --> 00:21:02.582]  Judge folks by what they do, what they stand for, what they produce.
[00:21:03.323 --> 00:21:07.327]  Again, I don't go to a clothing store because it's owned by white people or brown people or anybody.
[00:21:07.507 --> 00:21:09.308]  I go there because it's got good service and they got good clothes.
[00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:12.692]  I don't go to a restaurant because it's owned by white people or Hispanics or Asians.
[00:21:12.912 --> 00:21:14.754]  I go there because the food's good and the service is good.
[00:21:17.662 --> 00:21:20.825]  It's absolutely evil and it's absolutely transparent.
[00:21:20.845 --> 00:21:26.530]  We're going to get more into that coming up and so much more today.
[00:21:27.891 --> 00:21:32.456]  More news of secret government experimentation on black people including killing them.
[00:21:32.756 --> 00:21:38.381]  But you won't be hearing about that from Silicon Valley when they warn you that white people are evil.
[00:21:39.282 --> 00:21:43.678]   No, the evil mad scientist globalist They are the ones that are evil.
[00:21:43.698 --> 00:21:44.298]  So let me do this.
[00:21:44.458 --> 00:21:46.039]  We're going to have wide open phones today.
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:51.984]  First-time callers, long-time callers, at any topic you want, wildcard, just absolutely free for all.
[00:21:53.004 --> 00:21:57.768]  You agree with me, you disagree with me, you want to challenge me, you want to ask a question, I want to hear from you.
[00:21:57.788 --> 00:21:57.828]  877-789-2539.
[00:21:57.848 --> 00:21:58.148]  877-789-Alex.
[00:21:58.168 --> 00:21:58.308]  877-789-2539.
[00:21:58.368 --> 00:22:00.530]  And we're going to go to break in a few minutes.
[00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:07.470]  9 877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539.
[00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.470]  We're going to break in a few minutes.
[00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:14.470]   I'm going to come back and I'm going to drill into the real estate collapse, the economy,
[00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:16.470]  the crypto news and the China news.
[00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:17.189]  China News.
[00:22:17.668 --> 00:22:20.031]  Then we'll start going to your calls, and I'll get back into the human smuggling.
[00:22:20.371 --> 00:22:21.533]  That huge story confirmed.
[00:22:21.573 --> 00:22:22.314]  Just unbelievable.
[00:22:22.334 --> 00:22:25.097]  Because this isn't just Balenciaga promoting pedophilia.
[00:22:25.117 --> 00:22:27.880]  This is it going on, run by the government Democratic Party.
[00:22:29.262 --> 00:22:30.083]  That's all coming up.
[00:22:30.824 --> 00:22:33.147]  But let me make the big announcement here to the full audience.
[00:22:35.128 --> 00:22:49.827]  We had a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff with vendors and supply chains and problems the last two years with top-of-the-line supplement companies and others not delivering our stuff, slow rolling it, saying it was supply chain problems when most of it wasn't.
[00:22:50.988 --> 00:22:54.991]  Sabotage, because big leftist conglomerates had bought up most of the supplement companies.
[00:22:55.511 --> 00:23:07.739]  But in the process of learning about this last few years, we went out and went directly to the main suppliers, and a lot of the stuff we had was already being purchased by those groups, through those groups, from who we've now gone to.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:27.969]   So, we're able now, because of the cost savings and things, to bring free shipping back on orders of $50 or more, And we fixed our supply chain problems, and we were able to cut shipping in half on average for orders of $50 or less.
[00:23:28.009 --> 00:23:31.573]  So, shipping costs have gone way down, the tree $50 and up.
[00:23:33.891 --> 00:23:37.995]  And so that's going to excite a lot of people because that which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:23:38.015 --> 00:23:45.302]  We've done a lot of work to get through the middlemen and to really do a lot of solid hard business work to bring you even better quality at lower prices.
[00:23:46.003 --> 00:23:49.947]  And so as long as we can get some funding now and stabilize the broadcast the next few months.
[00:23:50.407 --> 00:23:59.652]  We're going to be in a very, very good position to stay on air and keep bringing you great products and maybe even expand in the face of this and have money to fight the appeals and not let the globalists shut us down.
[00:23:59.672 --> 00:24:00.773]  So thank you all for your support.
[00:24:01.093 --> 00:24:06.776]  DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Super Mel Vitality, Ultra 12.
[00:24:07.036 --> 00:24:09.897]  They're all in stock up to 60% off with free shipping.
[00:24:10.258 --> 00:24:11.899]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:24:12.139 --> 00:24:12.979]  Thanks for your support.
[00:24:13.679 --> 00:24:14.500]  Freedom's got me.
[00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:18.102]  The resistance to tyranny has got me.
[00:24:21.494 --> 00:24:24.878]  I am completely committed and totally obsessed with taking on the New World Order.
[00:24:25.859 --> 00:24:27.040]  And I've never been happier.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.181]  I've never been stronger.
[00:24:28.201 --> 00:24:29.602]  I've never been more blessed.
[00:24:30.323 --> 00:24:39.913]  And I'm just so thankful to God and God working through all of you to make sure this transmission continues to be a massive thorn in the side of the New World Order.
[00:24:44.167 --> 00:24:46.368]  We will be the torch of liberty in the dark of night.
[00:24:46.708 --> 00:24:52.069]  We will be the standard the Lord lifts up against the enemy when the enemy comes in like a flood.
[00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:54.110]  Nine!
[00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.751]  No, New World Order, you shall not pass.
[00:25:02.312 --> 00:25:03.812]  All right, let's get to the very serious news.
[00:25:05.173 --> 00:25:16.875]   Our brethren in China, our fellow humans, have been living since the late 1940s under a hell worse than anything anyone else has ever lived under.
[00:25:17.795 --> 00:25:27.660]  The Chinese communists admit they've killed a hundred million people since they launched their revolution in the 1930s.
[00:25:28.981 --> 00:25:30.622]  They had most of China captured by 47.
[00:25:30.822 --> 00:25:32.723]  They had full control by 1949.
[00:25:33.743 --> 00:25:39.726]  And since 49, they brag in their official annals they've killed 86 million people.
[00:25:42.551 --> 00:25:44.112]  So they only killed 14 million before that.
[00:25:44.132 --> 00:25:45.513]  They're very proud of that.
[00:25:45.533 --> 00:25:47.935]  They're not valuing human life.
[00:25:50.676 --> 00:25:53.138]  And now they've had people on lockdown for over 100 days.
[00:25:55.199 --> 00:25:56.060]  Over 100 million people.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:11.110]  And it's all an exercise of power to see who will follow orders to do inhumane, evil things to the public, and forcing the public to accept a face scan, a phone, to be able to leave your house, or buy or sell.
[00:26:12.623 --> 00:26:21.548]  And in areas that refuse and don't fully submit, they just lock you down and say it's COVID and then admit, well, you've not been submitting all the rules.
[00:26:22.288 --> 00:26:27.651]  And so the score of your neighborhood or your town or your city is that you're not complying.
[00:26:27.811 --> 00:26:30.973]  So you're under COVID lockdown for 100, 120, 150 days until you starve to death and die.
[00:26:30.993 --> 00:26:33.554]  We're going to turn your water off.
[00:26:34.295 --> 00:26:38.317]  We're going to let your houses and high-rises burn down.
[00:26:39.875 --> 00:26:45.999]  Then the paramilitary police, disguised in their white uniforms, walk around the streets, beating people over the head with clubs.
[00:26:46.839 --> 00:26:51.022]  Just randomly walking up to street vendors and breaking their goods.
[00:26:53.063 --> 00:26:55.185]  Randomly just disappearing people to death camps.
[00:26:57.526 --> 00:27:03.830]  Now, in echoes of Tiananmen Square in 1989, thousands of tanks have shown up on the streets around the country.
[00:27:06.032 --> 00:27:08.153]  And Joe Biden refuses to condemn it.
[00:27:09.653 --> 00:27:17.557]  Now if they were Black Lives Matter funded by Jordan Soros burning down some homeless shelters or shooting police officers, well they'd be good people.
[00:27:17.897 --> 00:27:19.738]  Kamala Harris would bail them out of jail.
[00:27:21.759 --> 00:27:26.982]  Maybe if you're on the side of the New World Order, well then you've got your rights.
[00:27:30.003 --> 00:27:30.844]  But nobody else does.
[00:27:34.312 --> 00:27:36.993]  So this is all a giant, raw exercise of power.
[00:27:37.033 --> 00:27:41.635]  So here is Justin Trudeau, who really is the dictator of Canada.
[00:27:42.095 --> 00:27:43.736]  He was elected with 30% of the vote.
[00:27:43.756 --> 00:27:44.816]  You say, how does that happen?
[00:27:44.856 --> 00:27:49.578]  Well, the other little parliamentary groups, after he lost the election, still got together and said that he's the winner.
[00:27:50.939 --> 00:27:52.540]  And bypass the voters.
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.162]  That's the problem with parliamentary systems.
[00:27:55.682 --> 00:28:00.365]  And he's the one in all the clips that said, you're not allowed to protest if it's against the vaccine.
[00:28:00.765 --> 00:28:04.007]  You're not allowed to protest if you're racist, which they weren't even racist.
[00:28:04.208 --> 00:28:05.949]  But if they were, they should have a right to protest.
[00:28:06.429 --> 00:28:08.690]  He called them extremists and all this and said it will not be tolerated.
[00:28:08.931 --> 00:28:12.493]  And they've still got peaceful protesters six months later locked up.
[00:28:14.585 --> 00:28:15.666]  They seized their bank accounts.
[00:28:15.706 --> 00:28:26.734]  They did everything that Lula's doing through the government he controls, because Bolsonaro never got full control, just like Trump never got even half control of the government, and they're taking their bank accounts and their children.
[00:28:26.995 --> 00:28:28.596]  They have their own CPS in Brazil.
[00:28:28.896 --> 00:28:31.818]  You protest, they face scan you, they come take your children.
[00:28:32.719 --> 00:28:38.343]  The same globalist, criminal, mafia, bullies and intimidators using the exact same tactics.
[00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:42.026]  So Trudeau says he wants to be a dictator like Xi Jinping.
[00:28:42.046 --> 00:28:42.727]  I can play the clip.
[00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.432]  I know if you're a new listener, that sounds like a lie.
[00:28:46.213 --> 00:28:49.558]  He actually said, I admire the dictatorship of Xi Jinping.
[00:28:49.598 --> 00:28:50.699]  That's what I think's best.
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:57.908]  In two different interviews, he now comes out and says, oh, what's happening in China is wrong.
[00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:00.691]  Just gaslighting you.
[00:29:00.711 --> 00:29:01.713]  Well, of course it's wrong.
[00:29:03.626 --> 00:29:10.191]  But he's been caught allowing secret Chinese secret police police stations to be set up that actually persecute Chinese Canadians.
[00:29:10.631 --> 00:29:13.333]  He's been caught letting them train for gun confiscation.
[00:29:13.573 --> 00:29:17.816]  He's been caught letting the Chinese train to invade the United States.
[00:29:17.896 --> 00:29:18.397]  It's come out.
[00:29:20.218 --> 00:29:23.200]  And so he wants to act like, oh, I'm against Xi Jinping.
[00:29:23.541 --> 00:29:26.283]  I guess he said Xi Jinping two weeks ago, dressed him down in public.
[00:29:26.961 --> 00:29:27.961]  Here's Trudeau.
[00:29:27.961 --> 00:29:31.961]  Canadians are watching very closely.
[00:29:31.961 --> 00:29:38.401]   Obviously, everyone in China should be allowed to express themselves, should be allowed to
[00:29:38.401 --> 00:29:42.560]  share their perspectives and indeed protest.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.922]   We're going to continue to ensure that China knows we'll stand up for human rights, we'll
[00:29:46.922 --> 00:29:49.922]  stand with people who are expressing themselves.
[00:29:49.922 --> 00:29:53.602]   We also need to make sure that China and places around the world are respecting journalists
[00:29:53.602 --> 00:29:55.561]  and their ability to do their job.
[00:29:55.561 --> 00:30:04.721]  We'll continue to make that very clear.
[00:30:04.732 --> 00:30:07.233]  We were protesting in Canada a few months ago.
[00:30:08.995 --> 00:30:09.475]  Last winter.
[00:30:10.636 --> 00:30:16.159]  And then they need to show the police beating people and releasing attack dogs on them and then cut to the clip.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.541]  In fact, McBreen's a great fast editor.
[00:30:18.901 --> 00:30:20.963]  McBreen, I know you're listening in your office.
[00:30:22.293 --> 00:30:31.555]  Show Trudeau saying we won't tolerate protests and they're racist, show them attacking everybody, then show him making the statement, and then show that he is a complete lying fraud.
[00:30:31.575 --> 00:30:40.077]  I don't know what's worse, a Chinese communist trooper hitting you in the head with a baton or having a Clydesdale step on your chest.
[00:30:40.437 --> 00:30:44.438]  I'll take the baton any day, and I'm not lessening what Xi Jinping's doing.
[00:30:45.078 --> 00:30:46.759]  I'll take the baton over the Clydesdale.
[00:30:47.179 --> 00:30:48.779]  Anybody ever been kicked by a horse?
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:51.480]  Ever been kicked by a horse?
[00:30:53.311 --> 00:30:55.673]  I got halfway kicked by a donkey when I was about 12.
[00:30:57.435 --> 00:31:00.919]  And it put a giant bruise on my side and cracked a rib.
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.722]  It was an incredible pain for at least two weeks.
[00:31:04.462 --> 00:31:08.407]  So believe me, when I'm around horses and stuff, I stay away from the end part.
[00:31:08.947 --> 00:31:14.553]  When a Clydesdale steps on your chest, you can believe almost every rib you've got is broken.
[00:31:15.481 --> 00:31:21.243]  And those police just run those people down and just have the Clydesdales just step on men, women, and children.
[00:31:21.544 --> 00:31:22.504]  They all should be indicted.
[00:31:22.564 --> 00:31:24.305]  They're criminal terrorists!
[00:31:28.766 --> 00:31:34.609]  There are videos from protests in Canada, peaceful protests during which police horses stomped on humans.
[00:31:35.709 --> 00:31:40.131]  Canadian froze bank accounts of those who protested and there are still prosecutions.
[00:31:40.491 --> 00:31:43.913]  Looks like sheeple will forget what they ate.
[00:31:44.738 --> 00:31:46.703]  For breakfast, one said on Twitter.
[00:31:47.785 --> 00:31:49.690]  Yeah, here he is saying he loves dictatorships.
[00:31:50.873 --> 00:31:52.056]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:31:54.625 --> 00:32:01.767]  Xi Jinping knows if you put millions of troops on the streets in camo and they're beating people, the world will say that's martial law, that's Hitler.
[00:32:02.107 --> 00:32:07.049]  But if you have them in white suits with guns, oh, it's like stormtroopers.
[00:32:07.089 --> 00:32:08.309]  They must be here for your help.
[00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:10.770]  They must be here to take care of you.
[00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:17.172]  I'm going to get to more of that next hour and the huge news in China and how big tech's working with them and what a scandal.
[00:32:17.192 --> 00:32:19.373]  But I want to get to calls this hour like I said I would.
[00:32:20.953 --> 00:32:27.837]  And we'll get into the economy and the real estate market and the latest on crypto and Oath Keepers and everything next hour.
[00:32:27.897 --> 00:32:34.120]  But I want to start getting to the calls and we'll intersperse a few stories that go to calls, a few stories go to calls each segment.
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:39.303]  And I'm going to get big into the human smuggling confirmed from the border up to Austin, Texas.
[00:32:39.323 --> 00:32:42.865]  Project Veritas shows the human trafficking, the sex slavery, everything.
[00:32:43.165 --> 00:32:45.046]  This is just part one of a multi-part report.
[00:32:45.086 --> 00:32:52.432]   I'm told it's going to be like five parts that are starting to come out yesterday and then another one comes out tomorrow and then I guess another one comes out on Monday.
[00:32:53.414 --> 00:32:54.976]  So it's just huge.
[00:32:54.855 --> 00:32:59.925]   Department of Health and Human Services insider says government complicit in trafficking child admits being pimped
[00:32:59.925 --> 00:33:07.535]   by their sponsor Wow
[00:33:07.201 --> 00:33:10.823]  Oh, and one of the hosts of The View says they're mad about the Balenciaga scandal.
[00:33:11.743 --> 00:33:14.844]  And welcome back to the Wednesday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.864 --> 00:33:16.945]  I want to play a few minutes of this Tucker Carlson piece.
[00:33:16.985 --> 00:33:19.526]  It's so important that I'm going to get more into it next hour.
[00:33:19.566 --> 00:33:21.427]  Your calls are coming up in just two minutes.
[00:33:21.707 --> 00:33:23.668]  But first, here's some of Tucker Carlson nailing it.
[00:33:24.841 --> 00:33:26.822]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Night.
[00:33:26.862 --> 00:33:27.703]  Happy Tuesday.
[00:33:27.963 --> 00:33:40.593]  Unless you read the Daily Mail, which is an English paper published online, you probably didn't know that Chinese President Xi Jinping sent tanks into a major city last night in order to put down protests against his rule.
[00:33:41.433 --> 00:33:47.518]  Virtually no American media outlets even acknowledged that that happened, and that's pretty weird if you think about it.
[00:33:48.098 --> 00:33:54.533]  Imagine, for example, that Hungarian leader Viktor Orban put tanks into Budapest to crush his political opponents.
[00:33:55.216 --> 00:33:56.136]  Would our media notice?
[00:33:57.197 --> 00:33:57.917]  Oh, yeah they would!
[00:33:58.337 --> 00:33:59.917]  It'd be on the front page of the New York Times.
[00:33:59.997 --> 00:34:01.138]  Morning Joe would lead with it!
[00:34:01.758 --> 00:34:03.659]  And keep in mind that Hungary is a very small country.
[00:34:03.679 --> 00:34:05.979]  It's got a GDP smaller than South Dakota's.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:10.441]  China, by profound contrast, has the biggest economy in the world.
[00:34:10.501 --> 00:34:11.961]  China's our main global rival.
[00:34:12.341 --> 00:34:13.942]  It's a highly significant place.
[00:34:14.622 --> 00:34:20.744]  And yet, somehow, no one in any newsroom in America noticed when Xi Jinping decided to replay Tiananmen Square.
[00:34:20.764 --> 00:34:24.165]  They just didn't see it, even though the pictures were on the internet.
[00:34:24.906 --> 00:34:25.706]  How's that possible?
[00:34:26.507 --> 00:34:31.889]  Could it be that the American news media is covering for the government of China?
[00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:32.830]  We can't say.
[00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:33.990]  We'll let you make the call on that.
[00:34:34.571 --> 00:34:38.733]  We can say we know for a fact that Apple is covering for the government of China.
[00:34:39.353 --> 00:34:41.274]  Apple is the most valuable company in the world.
[00:34:41.294 --> 00:34:43.455]  It's got a current market cap of trillions of dollars.
[00:34:43.935 --> 00:34:46.717]  Financial listings describe Apple as an American company.
[00:34:46.737 --> 00:34:47.737]  You can see why they do.
[00:34:48.217 --> 00:34:50.078]  Apple is headquartered in the United States.
[00:34:50.138 --> 00:34:51.319]  It was founded by Americans.
[00:34:51.359 --> 00:34:53.300]  To this day, it's run by an American citizen.
[00:34:54.332 --> 00:34:56.254]  But those facts don't tell the story.
[00:34:56.394 --> 00:34:59.757]  In fact, at this point, Apple is in no sense American.
[00:35:00.217 --> 00:35:02.379]  Apple's loyalty is to the government of China.
[00:35:02.639 --> 00:35:04.681]  And if you think that's an overstatement, consider this.
[00:35:05.381 --> 00:35:12.467]  Earlier this month, Apple did the bidding of the Chinese government to crush domestic protests against the Communist Party there.
[00:35:13.348 --> 00:35:17.190]  Apple did this by disabling its permanent airdrop feature in China.
[00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:19.331]  And so far, only in China.
[00:35:19.351 --> 00:35:21.371]  It's the only country in which it's disabled.
[00:35:22.032 --> 00:35:24.553]  So why did Apple disable that feature in China?
[00:35:25.253 --> 00:35:36.058]  Well, because that feature, permanent airdrop, allows iPhone users to communicate directly with one another without using the internet or cellular networks, both of which in a totalitarian state.
[00:35:36.238 --> 00:35:41.520]  Alright, so Apple's jamming the communications of Chinese that just don't want to be locked up in their houses for 100 plus days to die.
[00:35:42.793 --> 00:35:44.574]  They're aiding and abetting genocide and mass murder.
[00:35:45.175 --> 00:35:50.740]  The rest of the story next hour on this, because Tucker did a great job in a 15-minute monologue, and I watched it this morning.
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:51.340]  Excellent.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.243]  But we're going to go even deeper into how this really works and where this is going.
[00:35:55.764 --> 00:35:58.526]  Bottom of the next hour, we're taking your calls right now.
[00:35:59.107 --> 00:36:03.470]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Thailand on the subject of China, COVID, and the collapse.
[00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:04.371]  Go ahead, and thanks for calling.
[00:36:05.959 --> 00:36:06.519]  Hello, Alex.
[00:36:06.579 --> 00:36:07.000]  Great show.
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.821]  This is your Asian Eastern Infowar Outpost reporting.
[00:36:11.662 --> 00:36:19.726]  We have some live leaks from China being posted on Tyranny Response Team on Facebook.
[00:36:19.746 --> 00:36:22.627]  That's facebook.com forward slash Tyranny Response Team.
[00:36:23.187 --> 00:36:24.568]  We got the name from you, by the way.
[00:36:26.169 --> 00:36:31.331]  So, you know, it looks to me like there's some sort of sabotage going on because you see what happened with the real estate.
[00:36:31.751 --> 00:36:36.456]   You know that they're They're having a demographic collapse because of their one-child policy.
[00:36:38.358 --> 00:36:42.342]  So this does really lend to the theory that there's larger controllers.
[00:36:42.703 --> 00:36:48.329]  It's so strange to see all this happening right after Klaus Schwab mentioned China as a good model for the rest of the world.
[00:36:49.582 --> 00:36:50.362]  You're absolutely right.
[00:36:50.903 --> 00:36:55.545]  China is doing the bidding of the WEF, Bill Gates' top global group.
[00:36:56.266 --> 00:36:58.307]  And they basically dominate America as well.
[00:36:58.347 --> 00:37:00.148]  The same group dominates America and China.
[00:37:00.568 --> 00:37:05.451]  We have a large rebel contingent, not just in the population, but also in some of the elites.
[00:37:05.831 --> 00:37:07.412]  That's why we're still the best shot.
[00:37:07.873 --> 00:37:12.795]  But people like Trump in the past, he tried really hard to get America back under America's control.
[00:37:12.835 --> 00:37:14.016]  And that was Trump's biggest crime.
[00:37:14.216 --> 00:37:18.819]  He was far from perfect, but he really tried to get America back under America's control.
[00:37:20.327 --> 00:37:23.649]  Well, one way to put it to people, and this also brings Elon into the fold.
[00:37:23.869 --> 00:37:26.271]  I know that's kind of making him a little muddy, but bear with me here.
[00:37:27.532 --> 00:37:34.236]  If people look at this as a case of fracturing, okay, so how does the upper class stay in power?
[00:37:34.256 --> 00:37:35.657]  They fracture the lower class.
[00:37:36.017 --> 00:37:39.259]  This is our opportunity to fracture the upper class, which benefits us.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:40.760]  Absolutely.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.061]  We want to divide the elites.
[00:37:42.101 --> 00:37:43.142]  That creates diversity.
[00:37:43.162 --> 00:37:45.163]  That's why we have a separation of powers in America.
[00:37:45.183 --> 00:37:46.184]  We do exactly that.
[00:37:46.204 --> 00:37:47.184]  We fracture the elites.
[00:37:47.204 --> 00:37:48.065]  We unify the people.
[00:37:50.126 --> 00:37:50.987]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:37:51.047 --> 00:38:02.514]  And you know, the idea of multipolarity really comes down to just old forms of philosophy, you know, bearing.
[00:38:02.634 --> 00:38:06.276]  We need a separation of powers or we're going to get a central world government.
[00:38:06.656 --> 00:38:07.897]  Central planning is a nightmare.
[00:38:07.917 --> 00:38:08.957]  We have to go open source.
[00:38:08.977 --> 00:38:10.198]  We have to share our ideas.
[00:38:10.458 --> 00:38:11.018]  We have to barter.
[00:38:10.878 --> 00:38:16.478]   a tri-polar world, we want a hundred-pole world. We want real diversity of culture
[00:38:16.478 --> 00:38:20.077]   and ideas and that will allow the best culture to rise to the top through
[00:38:20.077 --> 00:38:25.396]   adoption by the population, not through forced adoption by the globalist.
[00:38:25.396 --> 00:38:30.638]   Central planning is a nightmare. We have to go open source, we have to share our
[00:38:30.638 --> 00:38:38.878]   ideas, we have to barter. We need an infinity polar universe. Absolutely.
[00:38:36.884 --> 00:38:48.774]  You know, if you think about it, Alex, with the way that inflation and everything's kicked in, everybody should be literally earning something around, well actually before the craziness, around three times what they get, their wage or whatever.
[00:38:48.795 --> 00:38:59.745]  I can tell you that from working in a farm, from farming and growing crops here, that I get so much return for my labor that does seem three times as much as I would get if I was plugged into the system.
[00:39:00.565 --> 00:39:01.486]  They don't want you to know that.
[00:39:01.946 --> 00:39:02.446]  I got to jump.
[00:39:02.466 --> 00:39:03.207]  You're making great points.
[00:39:03.267 --> 00:39:03.607]  Exactly.
[00:39:03.907 --> 00:39:15.375]  They want to take away people ever even knowing that if you just get your own business really going in the right sectors like farming in places, you can be self-sufficient and very successful and very happy.
[00:39:15.455 --> 00:39:16.395]  Thank you so much for the call.
[00:39:17.936 --> 00:39:19.757]  Let's go ahead and take another call on China.
[00:39:20.598 --> 00:39:22.959]  Let's talk to James in South Carolina.
[00:39:22.979 --> 00:39:23.440]  You're on the air.
[00:39:24.938 --> 00:39:28.339]  Alex, I know you don't like thanks, so I'll just offer my encouragement.
[00:39:28.359 --> 00:39:29.319]  No, no, let me stop you, let me stop you.
[00:39:29.439 --> 00:39:32.239]  I love thanks, and I love you, and I want to thank you.
[00:39:32.259 --> 00:39:39.921]  I just, when we take 50 calls and every person thanks me, it just turns into taking up our time, and the new listeners tune in and go, what the hell is this?
[00:39:40.041 --> 00:39:40.881]  I love you too, brother.
[00:39:40.921 --> 00:39:41.201]  Go ahead.
[00:39:41.221 --> 00:39:42.261]  I understand.
[00:39:42.281 --> 00:39:43.401]  I offer my encouragement.
[00:39:44.041 --> 00:39:54.063]  As far as the video from the lady in China, Alex, I just want to point out that it's not rape unless you distrust the science.
[00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:56.614]  You see what I'm saying?
[00:39:57.474 --> 00:40:06.620]  When we give people misinformation that these shots are bad for them, then they get scared and we have to rape them with anal swabs.
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:07.781]  You understand?
[00:40:07.921 --> 00:40:08.421]  It's trendy.
[00:40:10.387 --> 00:40:12.949]  And you're involved in some satire here, yes.
[00:40:13.009 --> 00:40:14.170]  The anal swabs are fake.
[00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:18.193]  The other COVID tests they've had are totally fake.
[00:40:19.114 --> 00:40:22.456]  And now the new official antigen tests are for flu and COVID.
[00:40:22.556 --> 00:40:23.457]  It's all a fraud.
[00:40:23.917 --> 00:40:25.178]  It's all about raw power.
[00:40:25.218 --> 00:40:33.024]  People putting up with a woman being bent over with men in white suits shoving a swab in her rear end and then breaking her wrist.
[00:40:33.444 --> 00:40:36.667]  This is just conditioning everyone to accept total hell.
[00:40:37.227 --> 00:40:41.150]  And that's why they want to take our Second Amendment, because that'll never happen in this country.
[00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:42.391]  Alex, one more point.
[00:40:42.851 --> 00:40:49.416]  As far as Twitter, it's the same magic show on a new platform.
[00:40:49.496 --> 00:40:52.878]  It's the left-right paradigm push and pull.
[00:40:53.438 --> 00:41:04.006]  They take your freedom of speech, and they take all ours, and then they do this huge thing where they ban a bunch of people, and then they back off.
[00:41:04.713 --> 00:41:10.256]  Where it's acceptable for Alex Jones, oh well he must have just went a little too far.
[00:41:10.716 --> 00:41:10.936]  No!
[00:41:11.256 --> 00:41:15.318]  If we let Alex go, then we all go!
[00:41:15.978 --> 00:41:18.559]  It's just like the Army, no man left behind.
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.701]  If we abandon you, we'll abandon.
[00:41:22.441 --> 00:41:28.784]  And if people don't wake up to it, you might as well let your daughter get in line for her swagger!
[00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:30.935]  God bless you, James.
[00:41:30.975 --> 00:41:31.675]  I hear your passion.
[00:41:31.695 --> 00:41:32.276]  You're absolutely right.
[00:41:33.297 --> 00:41:35.659]  They are showing us the rape of these people's dignity.
[00:41:35.999 --> 00:41:41.103]  They are bending women and children over in front of crowds of people and viciously shoving things into their body.
[00:41:41.483 --> 00:41:44.826]  It is about raping your spirit and saying, we own your body.
[00:41:45.227 --> 00:41:46.107]  It is pure evil.
[00:41:46.648 --> 00:41:48.569]  Let's talk to Jay in New York.
[00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:49.050]  What's up next?
[00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:49.630]  Go ahead, Jay.
[00:41:50.931 --> 00:41:51.432]  Hello, sir.
[00:41:52.378 --> 00:42:13.570]  I was wondering why the Republican Party doesn't broadcast that we're going to have people at all these election spots and have a recall on all of the illegal elections that have gone through and have a recall on like this Katie Harb and Federman and Biden.
[00:42:14.291 --> 00:42:33.506]   If everybody was to set up and go to everywhere where there was an election, And everyone went there and got a certified signature stating they want a new election and dropped off all that paper in front of the Supreme Court where they couldn't get in the building without having to look at it.
[00:42:34.167 --> 00:42:35.607]  Maybe they would have a new election.
[00:42:35.667 --> 00:42:36.248]  That's just a thought.
[00:42:36.348 --> 00:42:36.788]  Oh, you're right.
[00:42:36.828 --> 00:42:39.188]  We've had election fraud going on since voting began.
[00:42:39.588 --> 00:42:42.229]  They sent the State Department around the world to try to have free and fair elections.
[00:42:42.269 --> 00:42:46.650]  And if you measure it by the State Department's own rules, we have some of the worst elections in the world.
[00:42:47.071 --> 00:42:52.652]  They stole the elections in the same key battleground blue cities that they controlled for decades.
[00:42:52.772 --> 00:42:55.473]  And they stole it bigger than Dallas.
[00:42:56.173 --> 00:42:58.534]  And we're just getting normalized the fact that that's what they do.
[00:42:58.574 --> 00:42:59.754]  It's very, very dangerous.
[00:43:01.234 --> 00:43:01.674]  Yes, sir.
[00:43:02.115 --> 00:43:03.355]  And I want to say hello, Renee.
[00:43:03.897 --> 00:43:06.198]  I want to say hello, Charlie, and I want to say hello, Jamal.
[00:43:06.618 --> 00:43:08.639]  You've got a lot of fans out here.
[00:43:08.659 --> 00:43:17.622]  Some of us don't believe we're ever coming back, but we think that the only way to get back would be some type of a revolution.
[00:43:17.842 --> 00:43:18.302]  No, I hear you.
[00:43:18.322 --> 00:43:20.783]  Well, we're going to have to organize and create our own systems regardless.
[00:43:20.803 --> 00:43:24.944]  So as bad as it's going to get, now's the time to organize and be aware of what's happening.
[00:43:24.964 --> 00:43:25.885]  And I appreciate your call.
[00:43:26.305 --> 00:43:29.446]  Notice what Soros has done, putting in thousands of DAs and district attorneys.
[00:43:30.339 --> 00:43:33.424]  That's another way to vote, is your juries in your courts.
[00:43:33.824 --> 00:43:36.288]  They're fixing those now to take that vote away as well.
[00:43:36.668 --> 00:43:39.332]  And they're censoring, which is your other vote, is your voice.
[00:43:39.853 --> 00:43:42.878]  And they want your guns, which is your emergency vote, the cartridge box.
[00:43:43.038 --> 00:44:08.038]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:44:08.056 --> 00:44:11.598]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[00:44:11.878 --> 00:44:20.622]  But we've signed a new deal with a big national shipping company and they're able to cut our regular shipping costs by up to 50%.
[00:44:20.962 --> 00:44:26.906]   So that means even on orders that are below $50, You're going to be paying way lower than you were previously.
[00:44:27.206 --> 00:44:28.347]  This is a game changer.
[00:44:28.627 --> 00:44:29.848]  We're so excited about it.
[00:44:30.188 --> 00:44:32.090]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:36.774]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able to do it.
[00:44:36.894 --> 00:44:39.716]  So now, your orders will be shipped even faster.
[00:44:40.016 --> 00:44:41.978]  The same great customer service and more.
[00:44:42.438 --> 00:44:48.804]  So, get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:44:48.824 --> 00:44:55.530]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune system, lead a healthier life, and keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:44:55.670 --> 00:45:08.630]  at 414.com.
[00:45:08.672 --> 00:45:11.894]  Musk announced the decision after conducting an online poll.
[00:45:12.454 --> 00:45:14.775]  He tweeted, quote, the people have spoken.
[00:45:15.416 --> 00:45:16.796]  Amnesty begins next week.
[00:45:17.096 --> 00:45:18.978]  You know, the Russians are waiting for something like this.
[00:45:19.158 --> 00:45:24.821]  They need a propaganda campaign against the United States and against our support for Ukraine.
[00:45:25.681 --> 00:45:27.362]  And they're going to be all over Twitter.
[00:45:27.402 --> 00:45:28.203]  I guarantee this.
[00:45:29.384 --> 00:45:30.785]  Supporting the far right.
[00:45:31.125 --> 00:45:34.987]  So I think the idea that, forget it, this is over, it isn't.
[00:45:35.247 --> 00:45:41.430]  We have an updated vaccine booster that we want to do, but the uptake of that is, you know, less than 15%.
[00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:44.452]  It's somewhere between 11 and 15%.
[00:45:45.492 --> 00:45:46.793]  We've got to do better than that.
[00:45:47.333 --> 00:45:58.279]  And as the Mockingbird Media sets the bait while preening itself with million-dollar salaries... I'm not saying all rural voters are extreme, but you just brought up rural voters that came out.
[00:45:58.519 --> 00:46:09.462]  Ordinary humans continue to ask far more intriguing questions that will never be asked or answered in prime time for fear of being labeled a conspiracy theory.
[00:46:09.703 --> 00:46:29.869]   Massive questions like why are animals and insects all over the world suddenly forming moving concentric circles from sheep to turtles to turkeys to Earlier this month, the Chinese state news outlet People's Daily posted this video from the Chinese Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
[00:46:30.049 --> 00:46:34.150]  The flock of sheep had been going in circles for more than 10 days.
[00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:42.073]  Could it possibly be a reaction to the progress of the Higgs-Boson Particle Collider creating the God Particle at CERN?
[00:46:42.153 --> 00:46:45.354]  Could it be that Earth's magnetic poles are shifting?
[00:46:45.714 --> 00:46:48.555]  Or is it Phase 2 of Operation Lockstep?
[00:46:48.775 --> 00:47:00.679]  Where a ramped-up 5G attacks the immune system of those that took the vaccines, sending the world's animal kingdom with varying degrees of natural magnetism into circular repetition?
[00:47:00.959 --> 00:47:14.223]  After witnessing this video of ants reacting to a cell phone ringing, Australian entomologist Nigel Andrew from the University of New England surmised that a lot of ants use magnetism to orientate themselves.
[00:47:14.343 --> 00:47:17.104]  They have magnetic receptors in their antennae.
[00:47:17.304 --> 00:47:26.074]  If they're traveling long distances, they use magnetic cues from Earth to know if they are going north, east, south, or west.
[00:47:26.194 --> 00:47:37.306]  Phase 2 of Operation Lockstep calls for more 5G radiation to affect the immune system of the public, combined with the heavy metals found in the vaccines.
[00:47:37.967 --> 00:47:47.613]  This video clip is an example of the phenomenon using pendulum oscillators of different phases on a common platform suddenly sync up given enough time.
[00:47:48.714 --> 00:47:58.599]  Toxic symptoms information can be transmitted to and from individuals or the group very efficiently even if they move away from the initial source.
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:09.986]  The bodies of the injected provide the electrical power, like a battery, to continue resonating these fields, effectively turning them into wireless repeaters and routers.
[00:48:11.141 --> 00:48:14.803]  We're witnessing lethal damage by EMF irradiation.
[00:48:15.724 --> 00:48:18.385]  The more graphene oxide, the greater the damage.
[00:48:19.246 --> 00:48:24.049]  The contagion is not a contagion because there is no pathogen.
[00:48:24.389 --> 00:48:33.014]  Other early signs of Phase 2 within human civilization include non-compliant COVID fines being replaced with jail time.
[00:48:33.174 --> 00:48:36.636]  Most non-essential travel will be placed under lockdown.
[00:48:36.776 --> 00:48:39.558]  There will be an increase of military checkpoints.
[00:48:39.838 --> 00:48:52.304]  These signs either side of the road with the red in between painted on the road are showing up all around the exit roads to the main townships in the Tablelands.
[00:48:53.364 --> 00:48:54.485]  And this is the base.
[00:48:55.485 --> 00:48:57.905]  It can be changed into a roadblock.
[00:48:58.526 --> 00:49:08.187]  And more large-scale food shortages, which will force people to only be able to access essential products or services if they are awarded permission.
[00:49:08.507 --> 00:49:13.808]  Crushing discrimination against dissenters by corporations and banks.
[00:49:14.388 --> 00:49:17.649]  And the implementation of central bank digital currencies.
[00:49:17.909 --> 00:49:24.990]  They must roll out phase two while the momentum of the reality of the COVID lockdowns remains unprocessed.
[00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:35.954]  But of course, many have realized that the flu numbers don't add up, and that dying suddenly has become far too common, while protests continue to surge worldwide.
[00:49:36.074 --> 00:49:46.297]  And they must be stopped before Phase 3 results in the release of a weaponized SARS-HIV-MERS virus that could make a nuclear war look like sympathy.
[00:49:46.417 --> 00:49:47.698]  John Bowden, reporting.
[00:49:48.559 --> 00:49:56.086]  Incredibly powerful report, dead on, lockstep phase two, the world order going loud, animals react, Bandai video.
[00:49:57.167 --> 00:50:00.630]  We are now into our number two, going right back to your phone calls.
[00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:04.354]  I'm your host Alex Jones on this Wednesday, November 30th transmission.
[00:50:06.115 --> 00:50:12.301]  Well, Elon Musk just came out and tweeted that he's found evidence of election meddling in the last few elections at Twitter.
[00:50:12.321 --> 00:50:15.288]   I mean, we know That was going on.
[00:50:15.989 --> 00:50:18.170]  But this is a big, big deal.
[00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:21.852]  We'll be tracking and following that as we go along.
[00:50:21.892 --> 00:50:32.077]  We already know from all the documents that have come out of the congressional hearings that they're literally in there suppressing any pro-conservative, pro-nationalist, pro-Christian, pro-populist movements.
[00:50:32.637 --> 00:50:34.518]  They're suppressing any questions of elections.
[00:50:35.118 --> 00:50:37.159]  They are suppressing the Hunter Biden laptop.
[00:50:37.179 --> 00:50:37.860]  You all know about that.
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:39.321]  But it just goes on and on.
[00:50:40.041 --> 00:50:43.968]   While they then claim that conservatives Good morning, Alex.
[00:50:43.788 --> 00:50:50.108]   And the very same tech companies are on record helping China suppress its population.
[00:50:50.108 --> 00:50:52.146]  That's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:50:52.146 --> 00:50:55.827]   We've got so much more on the real estate market crashing and the Oath Keepers verdict
[00:50:55.827 --> 00:51:01.867]  and the Russia situation in Ukraine, American job numbers.
[00:51:01.867 --> 00:51:07.748]   We've got so much to cover today, but right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[00:51:07.748 --> 00:51:09.666]  Russell in Oregon, thanks for calling.
[00:51:09.666 --> 00:51:12.188]  Hey, good morning, Alec.
[00:51:12.188 --> 00:51:13.548]  Yes, sir.
[00:51:13.548 --> 00:51:19.467]   I just wanted to follow up with the conversation from yesterday.
[00:51:19.445 --> 00:51:25.065]   you're taking calls on Elon and something that I didn't hear mentioned was how he's
[00:51:25.065 --> 00:51:29.326]   implementing the blue check
[00:51:29.326 --> 00:51:37.685]   process for any user for $8 a month It's basically going to create a digital ID that you know
[00:51:37.685 --> 00:51:43.644]   Identifies a person there there won't be the opportunity to do such. That's right
[00:51:43.644 --> 00:51:50.085]   He said over and over again that he wants a universal app like China has to track everybody in lifetime
[00:51:50.085 --> 00:51:53.625]   So he wants Internet X to be dominant, so he's luring people in to pay
[00:51:53.625 --> 00:51:59.766]   Monthly to have an internet ID great great point that that's exactly it Alex
[00:51:59.953 --> 00:52:07.926]  And once you do that, you're not only verifying your own personal identification, but you're tying it to your bank account.
[00:52:08.459 --> 00:52:12.663]  And there is the foundation for the whole social credit score.
[00:52:12.803 --> 00:52:15.545]  He says WeChat is kick-ass.
[00:52:15.986 --> 00:52:21.651]  He is, you know, specifically wanting to make Twitter the X everything app.
[00:52:21.751 --> 00:52:29.218]  And for folks who don't know, start over and explain WeChat's the thing the Chinese communists use to control everybody and they make everybody use the social credit score.
[00:52:29.278 --> 00:52:31.740]  Explain he admits in videos that's his goal.
[00:52:32.891 --> 00:52:33.292]  Yes, sir.
[00:52:33.452 --> 00:52:37.377]  And WeChat also is connected to the vaccine passport.
[00:52:37.477 --> 00:52:42.883]  It's the QR code that turns colors to allow movement between different districts.
[00:52:43.063 --> 00:52:47.329]  The lockdowns, it's all, you know, controlled on the WeChat app.
[00:52:47.409 --> 00:52:56.035]   Your bank account, your, you know, Uber, Food delivery, everything, you know, can be turned on and off.
[00:52:56.175 --> 00:53:13.158]  That's right, and there is a race by governments and corporations to be the first to get the universal worldwide ID and for all the control and the social credit score and the carbon tax and the universal basic income and absolutely that just shows that Elon claims he wants all this freedom because he knows freedom is popular.
[00:53:13.458 --> 00:53:16.239]  He wants everybody to come sign up with him to become shackled.
[00:53:17.455 --> 00:53:17.835]  Exactly.
[00:53:17.915 --> 00:53:19.936]  And he has specifically said those things.
[00:53:19.976 --> 00:53:24.218]  He's in favor of vaccines, the carbon tax and universal basic income.
[00:53:24.498 --> 00:53:27.960]  He also has been promoting Dogecoin.
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:34.002]   And we got to wonder, is that going to be the foundational currency for, you know, working Well, that's right.
[00:53:34.042 --> 00:53:42.686]  He's trying to create a total economy where he controls the cars, he controls the energy, he controls the banking, he controls the internet, he controls the satellite, he controls the connections.
[00:53:43.226 --> 00:53:45.226]  He wants a unified system of control.
[00:53:45.487 --> 00:53:46.907]  He's got heavy backing behind him.
[00:53:47.887 --> 00:53:49.268]  And it's obviously the New World Order.
[00:53:49.608 --> 00:53:51.489]  They're playing good cop, bad cop, there's no doubt now.
[00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:53.069]  Thank you so much, Russell.
[00:53:53.089 --> 00:53:55.490]  But in the interim, it'll seem like the new wall-wall-west would be great.
[00:53:56.331 --> 00:53:58.952]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kim in Wisconsin.
[00:53:58.972 --> 00:53:59.592]  Kim, you're on the air.
[00:54:01.155 --> 00:54:01.515]  Hello.
[00:54:02.155 --> 00:54:05.736]  Um, I'm one of your many foot soldiers for 24 plus years.
[00:54:06.377 --> 00:54:08.917]  Um, 10 years ago, I wrote something and couldn't finish it.
[00:54:09.157 --> 00:54:13.699]  I called you a couple months ago about conspiracy of silence and within 20 minutes, I finished it.
[00:54:14.379 --> 00:54:14.839]  Here it is.
[00:54:15.679 --> 00:54:18.280]  If a plane does not fly, it cannot spread poison.
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:20.781]  If a boss is bad, he can be fired.
[00:54:21.301 --> 00:54:25.662]  If bad guys are in tanks underground, do not let them out to let this keep happening.
[00:54:25.722 --> 00:54:26.603]  Expecting change.
[00:54:26.963 --> 00:54:27.943]  Is that not insanity?
[00:54:28.473 --> 00:54:34.639]  As soon as the strong men and women rise and stand, the weak men and women will fall and crumble.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:35.460]  Then we win.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.242]  Keep the faith, and love you all.
[00:54:39.965 --> 00:54:40.425]  God bless you.
[00:54:40.445 --> 00:54:41.586]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[00:54:43.088 --> 00:54:44.910]  Elon Musk is evil.
[00:54:46.598 --> 00:54:47.938]  Thank you so much, Kim, for the call.
[00:54:48.539 --> 00:54:56.501]  Look, there's no doubt that they're bringing out a world ID and a control system to control our social activity and shut down all of the independent economy.
[00:54:56.921 --> 00:54:58.382]  So, it's all bad.
[00:54:58.402 --> 00:55:02.963]  It's not the technology's bad, but the whole thing's being directed from on top to centralize control.
[00:55:03.023 --> 00:55:04.584]  The future is decentralization.
[00:55:05.342 --> 00:55:07.464]  They're creating the false future of centralization.
[00:55:07.844 --> 00:55:14.409]  The future, let's get ahead of it now, where everybody's going to run to will be communities, farming communities, independent barter communities.
[00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:21.015]  And they're going to try to make that illegal, but we've got to start forming and start building those communities now ahead of this.
[00:55:22.736 --> 00:55:25.878]  As bad as America is, it's where the big final battleground will be.
[00:55:26.119 --> 00:55:28.781]  We're still the freest country in the world, as bad as we are.
[00:55:29.882 --> 00:55:30.762]  Thank you for the call, Kim.
[00:55:31.703 --> 00:55:32.704]  Paul in Florida, go ahead.
[00:55:34.517 --> 00:55:35.417]  Alex, you're the best.
[00:55:36.598 --> 00:55:46.703]  You've changed my life, and thank God I started listening to you right before the COVID thing, but I think I've written more notes in the last two years than I have in four years of college.
[00:55:47.523 --> 00:55:54.006]  I think my question is, if they steal the election in Georgia, it shows their power.
[00:55:54.798 --> 00:55:56.099]  Are they going to pull something?
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.401]  I don't think there's going to be an election in 2024.
[00:55:58.481 --> 00:56:01.464]  They're going to pull something big before that.
[00:56:01.684 --> 00:56:02.425]  I totally agree.
[00:56:02.445 --> 00:56:03.326]  The quickening's here.
[00:56:03.366 --> 00:56:04.207]  The gloves are off.
[00:56:04.687 --> 00:56:06.209]  The New World Order's not doing well.
[00:56:06.469 --> 00:56:07.730]  They're being opposed everywhere.
[00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:09.091]  Their rollout's in trouble.
[00:56:09.111 --> 00:56:11.253]  That's why they're playing good cop, bad cop with Musk.
[00:56:12.474 --> 00:56:22.020]  Still, they're fully committed, and so people better realize things only get worse by submitting to the system and pretending like everything's going to be okay and the good old days are coming back.
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:26.022]  The good old days don't come back until the New World Order is defeated.
[00:56:26.042 --> 00:56:26.462]  There you go.
[00:56:27.143 --> 00:56:27.383]  Right.
[00:56:27.763 --> 00:56:28.664]  One more question.
[00:56:28.904 --> 00:56:31.745]  I got 30 of your books, and I want to give them out.
[00:56:32.466 --> 00:56:33.446]  Have any suggestions?
[00:56:33.847 --> 00:56:35.588]  I threw a couple in the library slots.
[00:56:35.608 --> 00:56:41.171]  I don't know if you're going to take them or not, but I think that's the best way to get your word out is give away books.
[00:56:42.077 --> 00:56:49.067]  I agree, brother, and we're going to try to come up with some bulk deal to sell them very close to cost, so people can buy them in bulk and donate them to libraries.
[00:56:49.087 --> 00:56:51.651]  But I think, leave one in the dental office.
[00:56:52.458 --> 00:57:05.368]  Leave one in a barber shop, leave one at church, donate them to the library, or go to the city council or county commission and talk for your three minutes about the Great Reset and the war for the world.
[00:57:05.748 --> 00:57:12.073]  And tell people, look up Klaus Schwab's quotes about capturing countries, capturing democracies, cutting the people out.
[00:57:12.173 --> 00:57:13.233]  It's on his Wikipedia.
[00:57:13.614 --> 00:57:15.795]  He says, we don't want the public in control.
[00:57:16.136 --> 00:57:17.497]  We're capturing your governments.
[00:57:18.217 --> 00:57:22.601]  And so just push back and use any venue you can to speak out.
[00:57:23.602 --> 00:57:24.363]  Spread the truth.
[00:57:25.304 --> 00:57:25.544]  Beautiful.
[00:57:25.564 --> 00:57:27.166]  Thank you so much for being who you are.
[00:57:27.286 --> 00:57:28.908]  No, Paul, thank you so much, brother.
[00:57:28.948 --> 00:57:29.528]  God bless you.
[00:57:30.329 --> 00:57:32.231]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:57:32.291 --> 00:57:33.352]  Tony in Chicago.
[00:57:33.412 --> 00:57:34.113]  Tony, go ahead.
[00:57:35.474 --> 00:57:35.955]  Hi, Alex.
[00:57:36.015 --> 00:57:36.615]  How are you doing?
[00:57:37.356 --> 00:57:38.818]  You know, I'm actually in the fight.
[00:57:38.878 --> 00:57:40.059]  My spirit feels really good.
[00:57:40.219 --> 00:57:40.900]  I'm where I'm supposed to be.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.160]  Amen, you're in the right place.
[00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:46.542]  God has put you right there, smack there, where you're at.
[00:57:46.762 --> 00:57:54.524]  Don't question that, and I know you don't, and anybody listening to Tony Cisneros from Chicago, know this as a fact.
[00:57:54.784 --> 00:58:04.688]  God has made Alex Jones who he is, set him up where he's at, and we need to all agree with him and fight the good fight of faith.
[00:58:05.088 --> 00:58:15.251]   Not only against Satan and the powers of darkness, the powers and forces of darkness, but against the globalists The International Socialist Communist, whatever you want to call it.
[00:58:15.691 --> 00:58:16.952]  It is a great conspiracy.
[00:58:17.232 --> 00:58:20.573]  I've known about it, even since 1963.
[00:58:20.613 --> 00:58:26.235]  I remember as a little boy watching The Flintstones when Walter Cronkite came on and said, the president has been shot.
[00:58:26.455 --> 00:58:27.455]  And they said assassin.
[00:58:27.755 --> 00:58:29.656]  They never said singular assassin.
[00:58:29.976 --> 00:58:30.636]  They said plural.
[00:58:31.161 --> 00:58:31.601]  Well, that's right.
[00:58:31.421 --> 00:58:33.221]  first news reports came on.
[00:58:33.221 --> 00:58:34.760]  And they tried to scrub that.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:37.640]  But nevertheless, I just want to say God bless you.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.201]  Continue to fight the good fight.
[00:58:39.201 --> 00:58:43.801]   We're still secretly here in Chicago trying to get back the power that we had before
[00:58:43.801 --> 00:58:45.041]  under the first Richard Daly.
[00:58:45.041 --> 00:58:48.600]   And I'm not saying he was perfect, but at least he was for the family.
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:50.081]  He was for the old --
[00:58:50.081 --> 00:58:50.681]  -Well, that's right.
[00:58:50.681 --> 00:58:54.001]  Anybody under attack we know is good.
[00:58:54.001 --> 00:58:55.201]  -God bless you.
[00:58:55.208 --> 00:59:00.670]  And listen, with China, of course, I attended Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina.
[00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:03.750]  I would have attended Harvard Law School where my uncle, Henry Cisneros, went.
[00:59:03.811 --> 00:59:05.271]  He was a sociology major.
[00:59:05.531 --> 00:59:07.792]  He became our secretary, and I know the housing issue.
[00:59:07.812 --> 00:59:11.873]  They tried to make him the scapegoat, but of course, he's not now in the public eye.
[00:59:11.933 --> 00:59:12.473]  Oh, wow.
[00:59:12.593 --> 00:59:15.073]  He exposed the private federal reserve and a lot of good stuff.
[00:59:16.394 --> 00:59:17.334]  Oh, yeah.
[00:59:17.975 --> 00:59:18.215]  Wow.
[00:59:18.415 --> 00:59:25.161]  Well, listen, I just want to say that the China situation, Chang Kai-shek... Hold on, Tony.
[00:59:25.181 --> 00:59:25.661]  Don't hang up.
[00:59:25.701 --> 00:59:26.301]  I gotta go to break.
[00:59:26.321 --> 00:59:27.002]  These are hard breaks.
[00:59:27.022 --> 00:59:27.542]  Don't hang up.
[00:59:28.043 --> 00:59:29.784]  And then Carlos in Texas and so many more.
[00:59:29.844 --> 00:59:30.345]  Stay there, Tony.
[00:59:30.365 --> 00:59:31.125]  We're coming right back to you.
[00:59:31.706 --> 00:59:32.786]  Band-Odd Video, folks.
[00:59:32.806 --> 00:59:33.887]  He's got all the forbidden videos.
[00:59:33.947 --> 00:59:34.688]  Band-Odd Video.
[00:59:34.968 --> 00:59:35.489]  Share that link.
[00:59:35.509 --> 00:59:35.989]  We'll be right back.
[00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:47.558]  If you read Revelations, John the Revelator is on the island of Patmos, and out of the sky comes a pyramid ship.
[00:59:49.514 --> 00:59:55.458]  An angel walks off and says, here's a vision of what the enemy's going to do.
[00:59:56.238 --> 01:00:00.341]  Try to enslave humanity and kill the entire population.
[01:00:01.542 --> 01:00:02.422]  Look into the future.
[01:00:05.604 --> 01:00:15.951]  And there was world government and what's described as like robots and mass death and hologram images of the beast giving orders and the Antichrist with the power to do miracles and heal the sick.
[01:00:17.674 --> 01:00:29.382]  And how they rolled out the beast system with a symbol in the hand and the forehead to buy and sell and it was a human number or biometrics off your eye, off your face, off your hand.
[01:00:29.982 --> 01:00:34.586]  Let human understanding reckon the number of the beast for it is the number of a man.
[01:00:36.847 --> 01:00:57.254]   And now here we are 2,000 years later and literally there's a race by these big corporations and governments and dictatorships to create a one world government digital currency that tracks everything you do And Klaus Schwab says you will scan your hand or your face at first, and then they will inject nanotech into you so you can't even escape it with your number.
[01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:03.039]  And then you must worship the beast, the Bible says, to be able to buy and sell.
[01:01:03.379 --> 01:01:04.580]  You don't just take the mark.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.582]  You have to worship the beast.
[01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:08.243]  That means dedicate yourself.
[01:01:08.643 --> 01:01:09.664]  Do what it says.
[01:01:09.724 --> 01:01:11.125]  That's the social credit score.
[01:01:11.986 --> 01:01:13.447]  You must supplicate yourself.
[01:01:13.467 --> 01:01:14.528]  And at first it's easy.
[01:01:15.128 --> 01:01:16.029]  Just don't be a Nazi.
[01:01:16.049 --> 01:01:16.770]  Well, I'm against Nazis.
[01:01:18.359 --> 01:01:19.660]  And then it's, give us your kids.
[01:01:20.361 --> 01:01:21.221]  Take this in your body.
[01:01:22.402 --> 01:01:23.283]  Euthanize yourself.
[01:01:26.205 --> 01:01:29.368]  You know, I saw this last week, I haven't gotten to it yet, but I'm gonna play it coming up.
[01:01:30.689 --> 01:01:32.390]  Last segment of this hour, remind me, crew.
[01:01:34.632 --> 01:01:41.797]  And they're running ads in Canada, paid for by the government, government ads saying, killing yourself is so beautiful, come to the government today and we'll kill you.
[01:01:42.258 --> 01:01:47.282]  And you watch it and it seems like satire or a joke, but it's not satire, it's not a joke, it's real.
[01:01:51.206 --> 01:02:03.653]  So as Tucker Carlson said last Friday, everything is the fight to stop this system coming in.
[01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:26.045]   But the Bible and the transmission we were sent by the big guy's messengers was this is how the enemy, a fallen species on your planet, the devil and his legions, We're right outside visual light, just like you can't block uranium that's radioactive, you can't see the radiation coming off that's going to kill you, but it's there.
[01:02:28.627 --> 01:02:42.576]  And just like this interdimensional attack, all the globalists know this, Elon Musk talks about it, is right there, you just can't see it in the visual eye, and it is trying to get us through free will to destroy ourselves while building it the technological escape system.
[01:02:44.838 --> 01:02:48.641]  Because we're actually way more advanced in this fallen thing.
[01:02:49.813 --> 01:02:52.854]  And it's all right there in the Bible, but your controlled church won't tell you.
[01:02:53.555 --> 01:02:54.435]  Because they're controlled.
[01:02:54.715 --> 01:03:03.939]  Not even because they're part of it, but they were through the seminary, and the Rockefeller Foundation, the World Council of Churches, the National Council of Churches, they don't tell you what's there, and what the ancient Christians knew.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.061]  And what the cultures before the Christians knew.
[01:03:08.881 --> 01:03:10.562]  The Sumerians, the Egyptians.
[01:03:11.182 --> 01:03:12.042]  It's all right there.
[01:03:12.402 --> 01:03:16.264]  The Vedics, the Indians all know this, it's in their history books, for God's sakes.
[01:03:19.056 --> 01:03:22.238]  So when you see a movie like Prometheus, they're telling you what this is.
[01:03:22.318 --> 01:03:23.559]  The engineers come here.
[01:03:23.999 --> 01:03:25.780]  That we're a bad experiment to get rid of us.
[01:03:28.442 --> 01:03:30.543]  So I know I digress and I'll go back to your phone calls.
[01:03:33.205 --> 01:03:35.906]  But the government of Canada put out ads.
[01:03:36.527 --> 01:03:37.267]  Help is available.
[01:03:37.587 --> 01:03:38.888]  We'll help you die peacefully.
[01:03:38.908 --> 01:03:40.889]  833-456-4566.
[01:03:40.709 --> 01:03:48.709]   833-456-4566. You know, we ought to call that number coming up.
[01:03:48.855 --> 01:03:52.276]  In fact, let's do that next hour.
[01:03:52.296 --> 01:03:53.977]  We're going to call that live on air next hour.
[01:03:55.317 --> 01:03:55.697]  Remind me.
[01:03:58.098 --> 01:04:00.139]  Yeah, we'll hit that next hour.
[01:04:00.199 --> 01:04:01.359]  But I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:02.499]  You're doing a good job going to calls.
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:03.820]  Let me get back to your calls.
[01:04:04.912 --> 01:04:06.953]  You can say, well, that's just the Bible saying that.
[01:04:06.993 --> 01:04:11.715]  I mean, sure, it's coming true exactly like it says, but the enemy's just using it as a blueprint of control.
[01:04:12.235 --> 01:04:13.316]  That's what they believe.
[01:04:13.356 --> 01:04:14.456]  See, it's a mind trick.
[01:04:14.736 --> 01:04:19.498]  Oh, God's not real, but we're going to do what this book says because we think it's a great plan to control people.
[01:04:21.139 --> 01:04:24.841]  Whether it's a self-fulfilling prophecy or not, I'll just give you that, even though I know it's not.
[01:04:25.081 --> 01:04:25.721]  I know it's real.
[01:04:26.381 --> 01:04:27.622]  Let's just say it's self-fulfilling.
[01:04:27.702 --> 01:04:30.742]  Why the hell would you go along with that?
[01:04:30.742 --> 01:04:34.742]  By pretending you're part of the power structure.
[01:04:34.742 --> 01:04:40.422]  Everything you do, watch and control.
[01:04:40.629 --> 01:04:43.410]  Digital systems telling you what you can spend, what you can do.
[01:04:44.810 --> 01:04:49.632]  And then praising you when you do anti-human things, when you do destructive things to yourself and others.
[01:04:50.152 --> 01:04:53.213]  And punishing you when you do good, honorable, wholesome things.
[01:04:53.673 --> 01:04:56.214]  Not a good friend.
[01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:05.537]  An interdimensional force that is not in control of our dimension, but that needs to manipulate us from its dimension.
[01:05:06.454 --> 01:05:07.774]  To destroy ourselves.
[01:05:08.595 --> 01:05:09.955]  Very simple.
[01:05:12.816 --> 01:05:13.436]  And it's there.
[01:05:14.897 --> 01:05:15.597]  And it's happening.
[01:05:16.477 --> 01:05:19.258]  And we are so far superior to this, it's a joke.
[01:05:19.998 --> 01:05:21.519]  And that's the good news to the enemy.
[01:05:22.199 --> 01:05:27.521]  Our spirits are anchored in the third dimension, but that's our feet.
[01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:39.083]  Our souls are reaching up to the 5th, 6th, 7th dimension, and some of us higher, to the apex, the paramount of the 11th and 12th dimension and Godhead.
[01:05:40.264 --> 01:05:48.434]  And we are below that, and our spirit is in that fulcrum zone, tethered here in the 3rd jump point dimension.
[01:05:49.781 --> 01:06:14.099]  And if Satan and his minions can convince you to crawl down to where they're at and through your free will decide to be imprisoned by them in not the third dimension but a fallen false dimension they've created their own synthetic false reality or simulation which isn't even in God's 12th dimensional universe.
[01:06:17.061 --> 01:06:38.101]   So you must decide in free will Understand that you are in the higher dimensions and that you're only tethered here and the threats against your body, the threats against everything are nothing but a bluff to trick your actual soul that your mind simply interfaces with in the third dimension to give up and give them power when they don't have the power.
[01:06:39.462 --> 01:06:40.863]  They shoot me in the head tomorrow.
[01:06:43.223 --> 01:06:44.044]  That wasn't me.
[01:06:44.304 --> 01:06:50.588]  That was simply a third-dimensional manifestation of the incredible creature of energy and light that I am.
[01:06:52.569 --> 01:06:53.390]  And so are you.
[01:06:53.410 --> 01:07:01.415]  So as fallen and twisted as your body is, from whatever you've gone through or whatever has happened or the genetic attacks on your ancestors, it doesn't matter.
[01:07:01.855 --> 01:07:06.318]  Inside of you is the core and the connection.
[01:07:08.038 --> 01:07:17.143]  Like an anchor on the bottom of the ocean is at the third dimension and up that chain to the top is that buoy visible to God.
[01:07:19.805 --> 01:07:33.853]  You have to decide, no matter how damaged you are, if you can still feel the Holy Spirit, still see the light on the top of the water, if you can swim to the surface, then you will be in God's universe and you can beat these people.
[01:07:34.867 --> 01:07:36.748]  But you've got to realize you're eternal.
[01:07:37.068 --> 01:07:41.149]  You've got to realize your free will is the most powerful thing in the universe, because God gave it to you.
[01:07:41.970 --> 01:07:48.452]  And you've got to make the spiritual, interdimensional decision to say, I choose you, and then say, help me!
[01:07:49.132 --> 01:07:56.735]  And God will reach out and grab you by the hand, and will drag you out of that, and put you under his wings.
[01:07:57.795 --> 01:07:59.416]  And you will be total peace and completion.
[01:08:00.464 --> 01:08:01.986]  But you had to be given the free will first.
[01:08:02.106 --> 01:08:03.787]  You must pass this test.
[01:08:03.807 --> 01:08:04.728]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:09.233]  Alright, Tony in Chicago, thanks for holding.
[01:08:09.253 --> 01:08:10.334]  Go ahead and finish your point, sir.
[01:08:11.616 --> 01:08:11.916]  Yes.
[01:08:12.436 --> 01:08:18.598]  Okay, uh, I also wanted, uh, last night I called in, of course I spoke with Owen, and I gave my opinion on Elon.
[01:08:18.638 --> 01:08:47.107]   I said, uh, he needs to either put up or shut up, and, uh, he didn't put up, and he needs not to shut up, and, uh, and I believe, and I agree with one of that female caller that said he's evil, so, um, he showed us two colors, uh, Alex, and, uh, from what I've seen from him, Unless he makes a roundabout turn and really stands with you and accepts you and brings you back to Twitter, I have nothing to do with him, seriously.
[01:08:47.507 --> 01:08:58.212]  But nevertheless, there's just so much that's been going on within the Chicago area where the true patriots that are still there, and trust me, Trump had a lot of supporters in Chicago.
[01:08:58.532 --> 01:09:04.945]   They were just afraid to come out because if they did, they'd be attacked by the Antifa, No, that's right.
[01:09:05.405 --> 01:09:07.527]  You exercise your First Amendment.
[01:09:07.547 --> 01:09:08.647]  God bless you, Tony.
[01:09:08.727 --> 01:09:19.955]  Before I go to more callers, since you mentioned Elon Musk, again, is he opening up Twitter to get everybody to go there so he has the biggest group to later double-cross him?
[01:09:19.795 --> 01:09:21.835]  No, that's right, you exercise your First Amendment.
[01:09:21.835 --> 01:09:22.994]  God bless you, Tony.
[01:09:22.994 --> 01:09:28.654]   Before I go to more callers, since you mentioned Elon Musk, again, is he opening up Twitter to get everybody to go
[01:09:28.654 --> 01:09:30.914]   there so he has the biggest group to later double-cross him?
[01:09:30.914 --> 01:09:32.454]  I don't know.
[01:09:32.454 --> 01:09:34.194]  I think overall, I don't trust him.
[01:09:34.284 --> 01:09:43.686]  But I told you when he said I would not be returned a few weeks ago, I said it's because the EU is threatening to ban Twitter and basically charge him criminally.
[01:09:44.006 --> 01:09:45.427]  Here it is, Reuters today.
[01:09:45.447 --> 01:09:50.448]  EU warns Musk that Twitter faces ban over content moderation.
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:10:07.741]   And it goes, uh, Brinton told Musk he must adhere to the checklist of rules including ditching an arbitrary approach to reinstated banned users and agreeing to an extensive independent audit of the platform by next year according to reports of the globalist communist Totally corrupt, unelected EU.
[01:10:08.261 --> 01:10:16.284]  That's the EU saying, he previously urged most to comply with landmark EU rules against online hate speech, disinformation, which means anything they say, you can't say.
[01:10:16.684 --> 01:10:22.766]  European Commission's Justice Chief Director had also voiced similar statements.
[01:10:23.246 --> 01:10:26.968]  So there you go, the EU controlling what can happen with American companies.
[01:10:27.008 --> 01:10:28.048]  This is out of control.
[01:10:28.408 --> 01:10:30.709]  The Congress sits there and won't stand up against the EU.
[01:10:31.009 --> 01:10:33.090]  So it's allowed to happen just like China's involved.
[01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:35.750]  Alex, it's always good to talk to you.
[01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:42.612]  What I wanted to get to this morning is I want to mention that we have to work in our municipalities, in our city councils, we got to stand up.
[01:10:42.431 --> 01:10:45.350]  Alexis, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:47.791]  Hey, Alexis, always good to talk to you.
[01:10:47.791 --> 01:10:55.231]   What I wanted to get to this morning is, I wanna mention that we have to work in our municipalities,
[01:10:55.231 --> 01:10:58.072]  in our city councils, we gotta stand up.
[01:10:58.072 --> 01:11:03.072]  They are increasing the clergy response program meetings.
[01:11:03.277 --> 01:11:05.260]  I want to get that out there.
[01:11:05.781 --> 01:11:07.324]  They're gearing up for something.
[01:11:08.025 --> 01:11:10.109]  My dad's a pastor in Houston.
[01:11:10.189 --> 01:11:29.374]   He hasn't told me exactly what they're gearing up for, but they're telling him That they need to work together with the local government once again, you know, in case there were... For folks who don't know, they have a secret, now public, Pentagon CIA program to train and give little ID cards to the clergy to suppress people, to turn in their guns, take shots.
[01:11:29.434 --> 01:11:31.055]  It's all we have the newscast admitting it.
[01:11:31.475 --> 01:11:36.179]  And you're saying you've got family being fired up and they're getting them ready for some big event about to happen.
[01:11:37.307 --> 01:11:51.430]  Yes, they're not saying exactly what it is, but they, um, you know... I'm not knocking your father, but your father won't tell his son what they're secretly preparing him for.
[01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:52.991]  Just think about that, folks.
[01:11:53.991 --> 01:11:59.632]  No, no, so they're telling them, they're not telling them exactly what's going to happen.
[01:11:59.652 --> 01:12:05.015]   They're just telling them to gear up for some things around Something's around the corner.
[01:12:05.055 --> 01:12:07.176]  They're just increasing the meetings.
[01:12:07.236 --> 01:12:16.942]  They're having two meetings a week right now with a whole bunch of renowned pastors in the Houston area and just telling them to get prepared.
[01:12:16.982 --> 01:12:23.185]  Mind you, Lena Hidalgo and all these people, just like all those blue municipalities, they stole all those elections.
[01:12:23.225 --> 01:12:28.686]   They kept everything open to stay in power so they can do Maybe another one.
[01:12:28.706 --> 01:12:31.267]  The letter saying it's so important, because that's my intel.
[01:12:31.287 --> 01:12:36.490]  They've got Army Special Operations, all these community groups geared up saying something big is coming.
[01:12:37.410 --> 01:12:38.551]  What do you think that may be?
[01:12:41.012 --> 01:12:48.295]  I think they're going to try to bring their COVID lockdowns back, but they're going to try to do, they're going to try to anally rape us again, unfortunately.
[01:12:48.315 --> 01:12:51.796]  Well, not us, but they want to do like what they're doing in China, they want to try it here.
[01:12:51.816 --> 01:12:54.738]  I don't think they're going to fare too well in Texas, though.
[01:12:55.098 --> 01:12:56.899]  Well, that's exactly what Klaus Schwab said.
[01:12:58.032 --> 01:12:58.732]  Alex, we love you.
[01:12:58.792 --> 01:13:02.734]  Joe Biden, you wouldn't trust him running a limited stand and he's our president.
[01:13:02.574 --> 01:13:04.574]  Johnny in California, thank you.
[01:13:04.574 --> 01:13:07.134]  Alex, we love you.
[01:13:07.134 --> 01:13:08.134]  Love you.
[01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:13.374]   Joe Biden, you wouldn't trust him running a limited stand and he's our president.
[01:13:13.374 --> 01:13:18.973]   I have a feeling, I've had a feeling for a long time, he's just a face or a puppet for
[01:13:18.973 --> 01:13:22.014]  people behind the scenes that we might not even know exist.
[01:13:21.945 --> 01:13:27.129]  And I was just wondering if you could give me some insight on who is actually running our country.
[01:13:27.629 --> 01:13:30.691]  You know, they try to make it look like it's Joe Biden, but who is really behind the scenes?
[01:13:30.731 --> 01:13:34.494]  Well, I mean, British intelligence is, but the Brits don't run it.
[01:13:34.814 --> 01:13:37.456]  The British Empire was the biggest thing in the world until after World War II.
[01:13:37.876 --> 01:13:39.718]  It merged with the United States intelligence crews.
[01:13:40.098 --> 01:13:42.680]  It uses round tables at every major government level.
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:43.400]  Wow.
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:43.860]  Thank you.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:48.159]   regional and local roundtables that take orders and then compartmentalize it down
[01:13:48.159 --> 01:13:51.360]   to the bottom and so it's the old British Empire basically runs the world
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:55.600]   it's a consortium of every group major organizations the Communist Chinese the
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:59.020]   different globalist organizations Hollywood all the different ethnic
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:03.279]   mafias leaders are involved in it or they're shut down and so all the major
[01:14:03.279 --> 01:14:13.149]   mafias work for it it's just incredible Wow thank you God bless and that's how the people let's use our voices
[01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:16.640]   our hearts and do the right thing
[01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:15.591]  Absolutely.
[01:14:15.611 --> 01:14:17.954]  Remember, compliance with the new world order is death.
[01:14:18.714 --> 01:14:19.735]  Censorship is death.
[01:14:19.835 --> 01:14:20.716]  Do not comply.
[01:14:20.997 --> 01:14:22.098]  Build your own communities now.
[01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:23.239]  Warn people what's going down.
[01:14:23.259 --> 01:14:24.380]  God bless you, Donnie.
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:26.121]  Let's talk to Mike in Illinois.
[01:14:26.181 --> 01:14:26.942]  Mike, thanks for calling.
[01:14:28.724 --> 01:14:29.064]  Hello.
[01:14:29.364 --> 01:14:29.705]  Yes, sir.
[01:14:30.826 --> 01:14:31.386]  How you doing?
[01:14:31.607 --> 01:14:31.987]  Good, brother.
[01:14:33.308 --> 01:14:37.192]  Okay, Alex Jones, you should lead by example.
[01:14:38.077 --> 01:14:43.996]   And what I'm talking about, you preach to us about how that man was going to lose his
[01:14:43.996 --> 01:14:49.836]   apartment in Canada. How many homeless people have you housed since then?
[01:14:49.836 --> 01:14:57.197]   Before I get to human trafficking and human organ trafficking.
[01:14:57.197 --> 01:14:59.436]  All right, well, let's just stop and unpack that.
[01:14:59.625 --> 01:15:05.127]  I heard a clip two weeks ago where they're saying this man doesn't have money for his apartment so he should kill himself.
[01:15:05.707 --> 01:15:19.273]  In Canada, I was saying, in fact I'll play it next segment, I said I would, and I was saying that was evil, the churches and other folks should take care of this guy and we shouldn't have the government killing people and now you're saying it's my fault and you know what?
[01:15:20.973 --> 01:15:21.733]  You got a good point.
[01:15:21.853 --> 01:15:24.655]  I try to help people as much as I can, but I should do more.
[01:15:24.735 --> 01:15:26.175]  Thank you for approving me.
[01:15:27.156 --> 01:15:27.936]  Hey, please.
[01:15:28.416 --> 01:15:30.037]  Please don't turn down my volume.
[01:15:30.217 --> 01:15:30.898]  Let me speak.
[01:15:31.418 --> 01:15:32.378]  Don't censor me.
[01:15:32.458 --> 01:15:33.159]  Let me speak.
[01:15:34.079 --> 01:15:34.319]  Hold on.
[01:15:34.379 --> 01:15:35.020]  Hold on a minute.
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:35.940]  Hold on just a second.
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:36.140]  Oh, oh.
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:36.940]  What do you want to hold?
[01:15:37.521 --> 01:15:38.881]  Sir, I didn't screen your call.
[01:15:38.921 --> 01:15:39.462]  You're on air.
[01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:41.282]  I said you have reproved me.
[01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:42.143]  I am bad.
[01:15:43.865 --> 01:15:44.766]  Okay, I got it.
[01:15:44.886 --> 01:15:45.646]  I'm a bad person.
[01:15:45.826 --> 01:15:46.467]  I got that part.
[01:15:47.107 --> 01:15:51.070]  Now, I responded to your first claim, then you claim I'm censoring you.
[01:15:51.090 --> 01:15:53.932]  When I'm not, which is a false statement, make your next claim.
[01:15:55.273 --> 01:16:05.721]  Take your Rolex watch off your wrist and give it to your call screener because he only got one suit and he needs a raise.
[01:16:05.781 --> 01:16:07.382]  He needs a show of his own.
[01:16:07.975 --> 01:16:17.002]  Sir, I remember you called, hold on, you called 10 years ago saying you believe in a pre-tribulation rapture, and you've called in ever since angry at me, okay?
[01:16:17.502 --> 01:16:21.045]  Yeah, this is Bible Dan, and you refuse... No, no, no, hold on, hold on.
[01:16:21.065 --> 01:16:22.046]  So here's the deal, Bible Dan.
[01:16:23.227 --> 01:16:25.348]  The world government's here, the Mark of the Beast is here.
[01:16:25.909 --> 01:16:30.052]  When you're in the middle of the Antichrist world government, are you still going to believe there's a pre-tribulation rapture?
[01:16:30.492 --> 01:16:32.033]  Hey, hey, hey, listen.
[01:16:32.173 --> 01:16:35.716]  You don't want to talk to me because you know I will expose you.
[01:16:35.736 --> 01:16:36.797]  You don't know your Bible.
[01:16:38.474 --> 01:16:39.254]  You're a Pharisee.
[01:16:39.614 --> 01:16:39.974]  I get it.
[01:16:40.034 --> 01:16:40.835]  You're better than me.
[01:16:41.255 --> 01:16:42.416]  I appreciate you, Bible Dan.
[01:16:42.876 --> 01:16:43.556]  You're better than me.
[01:16:43.756 --> 01:16:44.256]  I'm a devil.
[01:16:44.537 --> 01:16:45.717]  God's going to judge me, not you.
[01:16:46.718 --> 01:16:47.078]  There you go.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:51.283]  Guy hadn't gotten it on the show in a couple years, been calling in for a decade.
[01:16:51.903 --> 01:16:56.046]  Okay, Bible Dan, we're all gonna get raptured out when the Antichrist shows up and y'all get the Mark of the Beast.
[01:16:56.347 --> 01:16:56.967]  It's all here!
[01:16:57.788 --> 01:16:58.648]  Bible doesn't say that.
[01:16:59.069 --> 01:17:05.534]  Bible says at the end, when Jesus returns, the archangel ties up the devil, that the dead in Christ are raptured.
[01:17:05.794 --> 01:17:07.175]  A two-year-old could read that.
[01:17:08.476 --> 01:17:15.462]  But you love your doctrine so much that you call up and indict me and say I'm a devil because I don't agree with not knowing your Bible.
[01:17:15.662 --> 01:17:16.523]  Hey, great man!
[01:17:17.483 --> 01:17:17.863]  I get it.
[01:17:17.983 --> 01:17:18.844]  You're the good guy.
[01:17:19.024 --> 01:17:19.724]  I'm the bad guy.
[01:17:20.605 --> 01:17:21.826]  Let's just move on from that.
[01:17:23.326 --> 01:17:25.988]  Bobaldan always calls in, lies about how he is, whatever.
[01:17:26.428 --> 01:17:28.029]  If they said Bobaldan, I'd go to him.
[01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:31.311]  He just... That's not very Christian, Bobaldan.
[01:17:34.693 --> 01:17:35.954]  Such a sad situation.
[01:17:36.314 --> 01:17:37.194]  I love you, Bobaldan.
[01:17:37.274 --> 01:17:38.315]  Teach me how to be a good man.
[01:17:38.655 --> 01:17:39.896]  More calls coming up straight ahead.
[01:17:39.916 --> 01:17:44.719]  I want to go back to your phone calls, but I first want to hit what the last caller raised.
[01:17:45.563 --> 01:17:51.426]  Canada's government is pushing, not just assisted suicide, but the government pushing suicide on people.
[01:17:52.626 --> 01:17:59.129]  And they ran a 30-second ad produced by the Canadian government that is right out of a dystopic movie.
[01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:04.591]  It was a great film made more than a decade ago by a Mexican director, I forget his name.
[01:18:05.011 --> 01:18:05.692]  Children of Men.
[01:18:05.712 --> 01:18:13.355]  About a dystopic future where the general public is sterilized and there's a collapse of the governments worldwide and a total tyranny.
[01:18:15.766 --> 01:18:46.490]   And they have TV ads you see on the televisions when people are watching TV advertising how great suicide is and how beautiful it is and how you're gonna have a great time when you kill yourself and you're out in the beautiful wilderness and you just that's why they let you kill yourself you're not allowed to go to the wilderness or leave your pond unless you kill yourself they take you for a party it's great and then they give all these social credits to your family and you kill yourself so like a rattlesnake jihadist blows themselves up or blows their kid up they get like a million two million dollars From the Islamic groups.
[01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:49.874]  Well, this is like, we're gonna give you credits and your family credits if you kill yourself.
[01:18:50.294 --> 01:18:51.976]  Whether you're healthy or not, you can kill yourself.
[01:18:52.457 --> 01:18:55.100]  Whether you psychologically, it's an issue, whatever, you can kill yourself.
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:57.342]  So you watch this 30-second ad, it's a woman.
[01:18:57.643 --> 01:19:00.986]  Things are so beautiful, it's so good, they're about to be so good when I kill myself.
[01:19:02.093 --> 01:19:06.717]  And they're selling it like, now, come, the government will kill you, and the government says it'll save money.
[01:19:07.178 --> 01:19:15.265]  It's so sick, and it's right out of dystopic Hollywood films, who are predictively programming people for what's now happening.
[01:19:15.585 --> 01:19:18.107]  Here's the disgusting piece of nightmare.
[01:19:19.208 --> 01:19:21.871]  The last breaths are sacred.
[01:19:22.892 --> 01:19:26.175]  When I imagine my final days, I see bubbles.
[01:19:28.493 --> 01:19:29.413]  I see the ocean.
[01:19:30.534 --> 01:19:33.575]  I see music.
[01:19:33.655 --> 01:19:39.438]  Even now, as I seek help to end my life, there is still so much beauty.
[01:19:39.438 --> 01:19:41.998]  You just have to be brave enough to see it.
[01:19:41.998 --> 01:19:47.917]  All is beauty.
[01:19:48.041 --> 01:19:49.122]  Hurry up and kill yourself.
[01:19:50.401 --> 01:19:51.382]  You want to see dystopia?
[01:19:51.963 --> 01:19:54.065]  That's it happening right now.
[01:19:54.465 --> 01:19:58.890]  And the blue states are passing laws for assisted suicide and instantly now pushing it.
[01:19:59.431 --> 01:20:00.392]  It's a culture to death.
[01:20:00.933 --> 01:20:01.713]  It's a new world order.
[01:20:01.753 --> 01:20:03.295]  It's a future world and we ain't in it.
[01:20:03.736 --> 01:20:05.017]  Well, how about we decide we are in it?
[01:20:05.938 --> 01:20:08.180]  Jordan and New Jersey, thanks for calling.
[01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:08.761]  Thanks for holding.
[01:20:08.781 --> 01:20:09.182]  You're on the air.
[01:20:10.899 --> 01:20:12.039]  Peace to you, brother Alex.
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:16.161]  Thank you for taking my call and letting us old-timers through today.
[01:20:17.261 --> 01:20:32.026]  I just wanted to announce Jordan here from CoronaEyes.com, a new video called Plague Riot on all my platforms, on Bitchute, Rumble, and Brighty on TV.
[01:20:32.706 --> 01:20:38.048]  I also want to say that I did a podcast on Powder Monkey Podcast, which is out there.
[01:20:38.108 --> 01:20:40.309]  I urge everybody to look at it regarding my research.
[01:20:42.595 --> 01:20:59.038]  I'm calling today because it's very important I speak to everybody about the secret biological weapons program the United States is running in various foreign countries all across the world under the guise of health and quote-unquote threat reduction.
[01:21:00.499 --> 01:21:39.001]   Two main sources here, you have the NIH funding stream of the likes of Barrick, Fauci, EcoHealth Alliance, And then you have the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA, who are conducting all kinds of different research using the loophole that was basically put into the law that Francis Boyle tried to have enacted, making it seem as though this is some sort of useful purpose for the culturing of all kinds of deadly pathogens that could be unleashed on unsuspecting populations at will, essentially.
[01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:41.000]  Um, in any of these areas.
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:57.404]  There's hundreds of these labs, essentially, and, uh, the Russian- and the new video I released called Plague Riot goes through, in detail, the whole history of- in March of this year, of Russia's attempt to expose these things, uh, using UN Security Council, which failed.
[01:21:58.324 --> 01:22:10.708]   Um, and I wanna, um, implore to you, if you talk to, um, Dr. Boyle, um, that there is gonna be a ninth conference on the Biological Weapons Convention Absolutely, and let me just back up what you're saying.
[01:22:11.047 --> 01:22:18.407]   that a contingent go there and try to have some exposure on these labs and that there be some
[01:22:18.407 --> 01:22:24.646]   American group of notable people including Dr. Boyle who obviously authored the biological
[01:22:24.646 --> 01:22:31.287]   weapons law to go ahead and to bring this to the fray in a very public way so where we get some
[01:22:31.287 --> 01:22:35.367]   coverage on this. Well absolutely and let me just back up what you're saying this is in red state
[01:22:35.367 --> 01:22:43.047]   news today CDC director Walensky seriously thanked Tuskegee study participants for their suffering
[01:22:43.047 --> 01:22:44.007]  and sacrifice.
[01:22:44.265 --> 01:22:55.072]  Tens of thousands of black men injected with syphilis, allowed to die of it over decades, horrible excruciating deaths, mental illness, microscopic worms eating your organs and brain.
[01:22:56.152 --> 01:22:59.815]  And giving it potentially hundreds of thousands, if not millions, they don't know.
[01:23:00.295 --> 01:23:06.279]  They called it a sacrifice and thanked them for the US government secretly injecting him with this, telling him it was a vaccine.
[01:23:06.879 --> 01:23:08.801]  And I'm going to get to that coming up next hour.
[01:23:09.421 --> 01:23:15.585]  Going back and remembering 30 years ago, Dr. Robert Wilner exposing Fauci for genocide, then with HIV.
[01:23:15.645 --> 01:23:18.627]  That's coming up next hour as well.
[01:23:18.667 --> 01:23:20.168]  But thank you so much for the call, Jordan.
[01:23:20.768 --> 01:23:22.550]  Let's talk to Carlos in Canada.
[01:23:22.570 --> 01:23:23.290]  Go ahead, Carlos.
[01:23:24.611 --> 01:23:25.772]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:23:26.359 --> 01:23:33.359]   I want to say underlying this whole issue of what we're suffering today is finance.
[01:23:33.359 --> 01:23:37.479]  All the instruments of control are related to finance.
[01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:43.557]   The killing of elderly and pensions, the cooperation of governments in the defraud of the pension
[01:23:43.557 --> 01:23:48.439]   And now the whole cashless society, central bank digital currency is about that surveilling
[01:23:48.439 --> 01:23:50.959]  and taking full control for every aspect of our lives.
[01:23:50.981 --> 01:23:52.061]  Carlos, you're so smart.
[01:23:52.301 --> 01:23:53.201]  You've been a guest before.
[01:23:53.241 --> 01:23:55.222]  You're a big scientist, doctor of all this.
[01:23:55.662 --> 01:23:56.222]  Don't hang up.
[01:23:56.262 --> 01:23:57.662]  I'm going to come back, give you the next five minutes.
[01:23:58.002 --> 01:23:58.662]  I'll give you the floor.
[01:23:58.702 --> 01:23:59.723]  You can host the next five minutes.
[01:24:00.923 --> 01:24:02.203]  I just, what you're saying is too important.
[01:24:02.243 --> 01:24:03.023]  It's central to everything.
[01:24:03.043 --> 01:24:04.424]  I'm going to give you the floor and we come back.
[01:24:05.924 --> 01:24:09.685]  And then, like I said, we're going to get to all this other news and your calls throughout the whole next hour.
[01:24:10.902 --> 01:24:13.564]  Listen, we can't operate without your support.
[01:24:13.764 --> 01:24:18.148]  And on my soul, on my children, I am completely maxed out.
[01:24:18.248 --> 01:24:19.189]  I don't have all this money.
[01:24:19.529 --> 01:24:22.612]  The stuff you see in the news, about tens of millions of dollars, hundreds of millions, all made up.
[01:24:23.032 --> 01:24:25.274]  All these other weird, crazy headlines that just sound insane.
[01:24:26.575 --> 01:24:29.898]  Those are put out so that you'll just think, well, this guy doesn't need support.
[01:24:30.118 --> 01:24:31.019]  It's total crap.
[01:24:31.359 --> 01:24:32.100]  It's all lies.
[01:24:33.564 --> 01:24:35.425]  And we have great products you need.
[01:24:35.525 --> 01:24:38.225]  So we went through a lot of stuff the last few years.
[01:24:38.285 --> 01:24:39.726]  It wasn't just supply chain breakdowns.
[01:24:39.766 --> 01:24:45.227]  A lot of the supplement companies we were getting great products from that had great ratings that we were using to make our products got bought up.
[01:24:45.708 --> 01:24:47.688]  And they would just not ship our product and mess with us.
[01:24:48.128 --> 01:24:53.090]  But in that process, the last year and a half, we found the actual mega suppliers who are the patriots.
[01:24:53.890 --> 01:24:57.091]  They're like 10% of the market, but they're out there and they're listeners and they're patriots.
[01:24:58.109 --> 01:25:04.772]  So we've got deals to have no supply chain problems, at least until new lockdowns happen, and do a lot of other things, even lower prices.
[01:25:05.332 --> 01:25:12.095]  So we're able now to bring back free shipping on everything $50 or more, and all the rest of the shipping is, on average, 50% less.
[01:25:12.734 --> 01:25:17.993]   So everything under $50 is massively less in shipping, very inexpensive, great deals.
[01:25:17.993 --> 01:25:22.634]   And everything else above 50 is free shipping and we're selling out of DNA Force Plus,
[01:25:22.634 --> 01:25:25.833]   we're selling out of Vitamin Mineral Fusion, we're selling out of Azo Beets,
[01:25:25.833 --> 01:25:34.194]   we're selling out of Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, we're selling out of the Charcoal Concentrate Toothpaste
[01:25:34.194 --> 01:25:36.913]  and the Natural Tooth Whitening Toothpaste with no Fluoride.
[01:25:36.913 --> 01:25:39.094]  It's all selling out.
[01:25:39.094 --> 01:25:40.514]  We need the funds.
[01:25:40.514 --> 01:25:44.194]   T-shirts are all gone, all those years T-shirts, all the bat stuff, it's all gone.
[01:25:44.194 --> 01:25:46.234]  No T-shirts down at Infowars.com.
[01:25:46.234 --> 01:25:48.375]  No X2, no X3, it's hopefully coming back.
[01:25:48.375 --> 01:25:52.154]  The point is, this is your chance to get DNA Force Plus.
[01:25:51.655 --> 01:25:56.796]  It actually makes your telomeres last longer and cleans out your cells and supercharges your immune system and vitamin refusion and all of it.
[01:25:57.377 --> 01:25:59.177]  Up to 60% off with promo code 1776.
[01:25:59.397 --> 01:26:01.977]  This stuff is very close to selling out.
[01:26:02.277 --> 01:26:05.598]  And on top of it, free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:26:05.738 --> 01:26:06.498]  That is back.
[01:26:06.978 --> 01:26:08.299]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:26:08.859 --> 01:26:10.479]  A super male vitality.
[01:26:11.539 --> 01:26:12.739]  The knockout sleep support.
[01:26:12.779 --> 01:26:14.940]  It's all there at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:16.140]  We'll be right back with our number three.
[01:26:17.003 --> 01:26:20.206]  Man, a bunch of major news just broke at Infowars.com.
[01:26:20.226 --> 01:26:22.849]  It's so over the top, but I'm going to hit it next segment.
[01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:25.371]  Carlos has been a guest on the show.
[01:26:25.391 --> 01:26:26.052]  We know who he is.
[01:26:26.092 --> 01:26:31.437]  He's a scientist, a researcher, worked at the highest levels of corporations and with governments.
[01:26:31.457 --> 01:26:32.679]  He really knows what he's talking about.
[01:26:32.699 --> 01:26:39.485]  So you're going to host the next five minutes, Carlos, about finance and this whole central bank digital currency and this revolution we're facing.
[01:26:39.525 --> 01:26:40.186]  Start back over.
[01:26:40.226 --> 01:26:40.807]  You've got the floor.
[01:26:42.159 --> 01:26:42.619]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:49.024]  Well, it really, I think to be the spearhead, you really have to teach yourself.
[01:26:49.404 --> 01:26:54.668]  And one of the availabilities that you have right now is a video that is on YouTube.
[01:26:55.048 --> 01:26:59.471]  It's called Inclusive Capitalism with the Aspen Institute.
[01:27:00.051 --> 01:27:07.957]  If you watch that video, near the end of the video, you will find one of the participants is a lady, Lynn Rothschild, Linda Rothschild.
[01:27:08.437 --> 01:27:39.749]   And she is, I believe, on the board or the And she discusses with the other participants who are money managers of trillions of dollars the problem that they have in a sense that capitalism has become so abusive of the individual person, the disparity in the wealth is so enormous that they fear for the instability of the world and they fear for the fact that people will just simply not accept this because when you really analyze it
[01:27:40.089 --> 01:27:46.673]  The exercise of the financial system has been to control people so that they pay back the loans that they take.
[01:27:47.174 --> 01:27:57.360]  And from history, the financiers, their biggest concern has been that governments or individuals would not pay back the loans and they would be short of their money and their palaces, etc.
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:28:01.723]  Because they replaced the monarchies that they wanted to control financially.
[01:28:02.163 --> 01:28:14.928]  So, at this stage of the game, you can see the fear of the portfolio managers and the basic portfolio holders that individual people are beginning to question, what kind of capitalism is this?
[01:28:15.288 --> 01:28:22.671]  So, they try to make it inclusive to reduce the gap between those who are so, wealth disparity is so great.
[01:28:23.691 --> 01:28:37.650]   Now, she mentions in the last few minutes, take 10 minutes before the end of the program, and she says that the entire The financial system has to be basically destroyed and restored again.
[01:28:38.370 --> 01:28:46.852]  Now, when somebody like Lynn Forster, the Rothschild, tells you that, now her husband, Evelyn the Rothschild... And let me interrupt you.
[01:28:46.872 --> 01:28:50.233]  She started coming out 20 years ago saying this, and about 10 years ago they've been pushing it.
[01:28:51.013 --> 01:28:51.433]  You're right.
[01:28:51.513 --> 01:28:54.494]  At the low level, they go, oh, capitalism's been abusive.
[01:28:54.514 --> 01:28:55.274]  It's not capitalism.
[01:28:55.294 --> 01:28:59.355]  It's been crony, centralized, authoritarian, monopoly capitalism.
[01:29:00.055 --> 01:29:02.798]  Using communist and socialist and fascist tactics.
[01:29:03.118 --> 01:29:22.435]  They tell all the mid-level rich people, everybody, we've got to do this to stop a rebellion, but really the key is the global control to mobilize the giant masses that they've impoverished to annihilate the middle class and consolidate control of the super elite who talk all day about making the poor rich, but who've done the biggest wealth disparity in the last decade in history.
[01:29:22.756 --> 01:29:25.318]  So again, they create the problem, offer their false solution.
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:26.800]  Exactly.
[01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:37.266]  And so their plan is clearly and essentially to have full control so that you cannot borrow without paying back.
[01:29:37.526 --> 01:29:40.768]  And the idea is that once you control the money, you control everybody.
[01:29:41.008 --> 01:29:43.589]  Well, I heard Rothschild say that in the past.
[01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:46.151]  Give me the money and I will control all the law.
[01:29:46.511 --> 01:29:53.804]  Exactly, so they say, oh, all we want you to do is be socially responsible, but now they've got full slave control over your actual actions, which is the real currency.
[01:29:54.024 --> 01:29:58.071]  So it's their false, fraudulent Ponzi scheme taking over the human dimension fully.
[01:30:01.007 --> 01:30:08.773]  Well, Linda Rothschild was the lady that was housing Ghislaine Maxwell in New York City in her apartment after her father jumped off a boat, right?
[01:30:09.294 --> 01:30:23.425]  And so, Linda Rothschild was on the airplanes going to Jeffrey Epstein's Island, and Linda Rothschild was introduced to Evelyn Rothschild by Kissinger, who suggested he marry her, because actually, she's a very good- Absolutely.
[01:30:23.465 --> 01:30:29.009]  These people are the scum of the earth, posing as the public savior, when they are the most greedy, hateful people on the planet.
[01:30:30.011 --> 01:30:34.717]  And the solution is to look at your iPhone and to say, this is my shackle.
[01:30:35.318 --> 01:30:41.966]  Because with my iPhone, they control what I say, what I wear, they even have a signable symbol, what I buy, what I purchase.
[01:30:42.267 --> 01:30:43.108]  Hey, wait a second!
[01:30:43.928 --> 01:30:45.609]  This is not the first rodeo.
[01:30:45.949 --> 01:30:47.749]  Mankind has gone through this before.
[01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:57.312]  The American people ran off Europe from central bankers to start the United States of America when George, the king, failed to control the bankers.
[01:30:57.653 --> 01:30:57.993]  That's right.
[01:30:58.013 --> 01:30:59.393]  We're going to beat them this time, too.
[01:30:59.493 --> 01:31:00.674]  And a lot of us are addicted.
[01:31:00.694 --> 01:31:03.054]  We're trying to get off of them, but they're useful tools.
[01:31:03.074 --> 01:31:06.796]  But at the end of the day, the enemy owns them and it's an enemy operative inside our houses.
[01:31:06.816 --> 01:31:07.656]  Thank you, Carlos.
[01:31:07.676 --> 01:31:08.196]  Great points.
[01:31:08.656 --> 01:31:10.117]  Huge news breaking on the other side.
[01:31:10.137 --> 01:31:10.757]  60 seconds.
[01:31:10.577 --> 01:31:24.416]  Stay with us.
[01:31:24.831 --> 01:31:33.256]  Many of our top selling items are included in this sale and are in limited supply, so once they're out, they will probably not be back in stock until next year.
[01:31:33.636 --> 01:31:43.522]  Everything is listed at deep discounts of up to 60% off market price, plus if you order now, we will include a free gift from the store for every order, regardless of what you buy.
[01:31:44.102 --> 01:31:50.745]  This item will be chosen at random from a hand-picked selection of our DVDs, books, stickers, and so much more.
[01:31:51.186 --> 01:31:56.008]  This is our gift to you for supporting the InfoWars and the Voice of Freedom worldwide.
[01:31:56.348 --> 01:32:07.134]  After the seemingly never-ending barrage of attacks on us, Alex and the rest of the crew here at InfoWars needs all the help we can get to allow the message of a pro-human future to reach the masses.
[01:32:08.174 --> 01:32:19.178]  So, we've got some huge breaking news.
[01:32:19.218 --> 01:32:30.222]  More and more videos are coming out of Communist China, the playground of transhumanism and dehumanization and slavery, the blueprint and the model for the rest of the world in Klaus Schwab's own words.
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:38.003]  Last week, torturing a father in front of his children in their house because he visited the wrong website.
[01:32:38.724 --> 01:32:42.205]  That's coming up, the full shock videos on InfoWars.com.
[01:32:43.166 --> 01:32:47.768]  We also have, my boy is dead from the vaccine, FU, Angry Dad Tells Trudeau.
[01:32:48.989 --> 01:32:50.049]  We'll continue with your calls.
[01:32:50.089 --> 01:32:55.212]  Then I'm also going to look back 30 years ago when top scientists were exposing Fauci of genocide then.
[01:32:57.748 --> 01:33:05.893]  But let's go to a short compilation that was just put together because in the first hour I was playing Trudeau saying, oh China cracking down on demonstrators.
[01:33:05.913 --> 01:33:06.533]  That's terrible.
[01:33:06.813 --> 01:33:10.656]  When he said we're outlawing demonstrations against lockdowns in Canada.
[01:33:10.956 --> 01:33:15.058]  These are demonstrations against long-term evil lockdowns for total control.
[01:33:15.719 --> 01:33:16.599]  He's all part of that.
[01:33:16.619 --> 01:33:19.001]  He says he admires Xi Jinping and his dictatorship.
[01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:30.864]   He's on the CCP tit and he's literally there saying, The Xi Jinping's bad now because he knows he's in political trouble.
[01:33:31.264 --> 01:33:32.885]  Only won his election by 30 percent.
[01:33:33.265 --> 01:33:33.845]  It's parliamentary.
[01:33:33.865 --> 01:33:34.665]  There are a bunch of candidates.
[01:33:35.226 --> 01:33:36.326]  So he's a dictator, folks.
[01:33:36.646 --> 01:33:37.367]  The people don't want him.
[01:33:37.587 --> 01:33:39.828]  He didn't have a majority rule, okay?
[01:33:39.928 --> 01:33:43.530]  And so here's a compilation of what he said last night versus what he said in the past.
[01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:45.371]  Then we'll get to the new CCP video.
[01:33:45.871 --> 01:33:54.319]  The young generation, like Prime Minister Trudeau, half of this cabinet are actually young global leaders of the World Economic Forum.
[01:33:54.599 --> 01:33:56.599]  so it will penetrate the cabinets.
[01:33:56.599 --> 01:33:58.599]  Everything we discuss is leaked to the paper.
[01:33:58.599 --> 01:34:00.599]  That's not appropriate.
[01:34:00.599 --> 01:34:06.599]  And that's not all the way the conversation was conducted.
[01:34:06.599 --> 01:34:12.599]  Canadians are watching very closely.
[01:34:13.275 --> 01:34:23.463]  Obviously everyone in China should be allowed to express themselves, should be allowed to share their perspectives and indeed protest.
[01:34:23.503 --> 01:34:30.387]   We're going to continue to ensure that China knows we'll stand up for human rights, we'll stand with people who are expressing themselves.
[01:34:30.387 --> 01:34:35.467]   We also need to make sure that China and places around the world are respecting journalists and their ability to do
[01:34:35.467 --> 01:34:35.867]  their job.
[01:34:35.867 --> 01:34:40.306]  There's a level of admiration I actually have for China.
[01:34:40.306 --> 01:34:50.577]   Because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say we
[01:34:50.577 --> 01:34:55.147]   need to go green as fast as we need to start, you know, investing in solar.
[01:34:54.613 --> 01:35:00.618]  I mean, there is a flexibility that I know Stephen Hartford must dream about of having a dictatorship that he could do everything he wanted.
[01:35:00.738 --> 01:35:03.201]  That I find quite interesting.
[01:35:03.729 --> 01:35:14.089]  Regardless of the fact that we are attacking your fundamental rights or limiting your fundamental rights, and the Charter says that's wrong.
[01:35:15.071 --> 01:35:16.792]  We're still going to go ahead and do with it.
[01:35:17.373 --> 01:35:46.133]   The small fringe minority of people who are on their way to Ottawa or who are holding unacceptable views that they're expressing do not represent the views of Canadians who have been there for each other, who know that following the science and stepping up to protect each other Is the best way to continue to ensure our freedoms, our rights, our values as a country.
[01:35:46.473 --> 01:35:56.980]  We are not intimidated by those who hurl insults and abuse at small business workers and steal food from the homeless.
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:36:01.903]  We won't give in to those who fly racist flags.
[01:36:02.863 --> 01:36:09.797]   We won't cave To those who engage in vandalism or dishonor the memory of our veterans.
[01:36:10.397 --> 01:36:14.460]  So to those responsible for this behavior, it needs to stop.
[01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:23.286]  The Emergencies Act will be used to strengthen and support law enforcement agencies at all levels across the country.
[01:36:24.146 --> 01:36:24.667]  As of today.
[01:36:25.751 --> 01:36:36.093]  A bank or other financial service provider will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account without a court order.
[01:36:36.433 --> 01:36:39.434]  Justin Trudeau, I mean, I thought he was kind of a cool guy.
[01:36:39.454 --> 01:36:48.636]  When I started to read what he said, this is a couple of weeks ago, he was, or maybe this is September, but he was talking about people who are not vaccinated.
[01:36:49.776 --> 01:36:51.256]  He said, they don't believe in science.
[01:36:51.296 --> 01:36:53.477]  They're often misogynistic, often racist.
[01:36:53.657 --> 01:36:54.337]  No, they're not.
[01:36:54.397 --> 01:36:56.118]  That was not smart of him at all.
[01:36:56.178 --> 01:36:56.458]  Right.
[01:36:56.518 --> 01:36:58.558]  He said, but they take up space.
[01:36:59.859 --> 01:37:03.440]  And with that, we have to make a choice in terms of a leader as a country.
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.460]  Do we tolerate these people?
[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:06.540]  It's like, tolerate?
[01:37:06.721 --> 01:37:07.961]  Now you do sound like Hitler.
[01:37:09.434 --> 01:37:14.177]  Now you do sound like you're a dictator because he's a Klaus Schwab globalist and they run G.G.Ping.
[01:37:14.257 --> 01:37:17.999]  It's the same people, the same program, the same names.
[01:37:18.319 --> 01:37:19.440]  They're your enemy.
[01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.241]  Your whole life's going to be ruined.
[01:37:21.721 --> 01:37:23.282]  They're going to kill you when they're done.
[01:37:23.302 --> 01:37:24.563]  Do you understand?
[01:37:24.623 --> 01:37:25.684]  I'm not just telling you that.
[01:37:25.884 --> 01:37:30.406]  How much of what I tell you has to come true before you know it's true?
[01:37:33.988 --> 01:37:37.911]  My uncle worked in secret operations in Latin America.
[01:37:39.321 --> 01:37:41.723]  He got out of them because they were smuggling kids.
[01:37:41.763 --> 01:37:42.363]  The U.S.
[01:37:42.403 --> 01:37:45.145]  government kidnapped children out of Guatemala.
[01:37:45.706 --> 01:37:48.067]  I don't need to read it in a book or see it on the news.
[01:37:48.107 --> 01:37:50.889]  My uncle, who was a war hero, told me about it.
[01:37:51.750 --> 01:38:00.236]  And I've got Project Veritas today with video of kidnapped children being sold into sex slavery in downtown Austin!
[01:38:05.099 --> 01:38:06.901]  What are we going to do about this?
[01:38:08.817 --> 01:38:12.078]  You think you're safe when these people are running around controlling everything?
[01:38:14.238 --> 01:38:20.180]  And they're busy finding with this tyranny and these beta rollouts of lockdowns that control what people will follow their orders.
[01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:21.520]  They don't want to defund the police.
[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:23.120]  They want to get rid of the good police.
[01:38:23.321 --> 01:38:28.182]  They're not perfect, but they're good compared to what we're about to get, who will follow orders like we now see in China.
[01:38:28.582 --> 01:38:30.402]  The full videos on InfoWars.com.
[01:38:31.482 --> 01:38:32.183]  Shock video.
[01:38:32.463 --> 01:38:39.075]   CCP thugs break into man's home, torture him in front of They're children.
[01:38:41.016 --> 01:38:43.037]  Because they saw he visited the wrong website.
[01:38:43.898 --> 01:38:45.379]  Full articles on Infowars.com.
[01:38:45.739 --> 01:38:51.683]  This is what's coming to a town near you, and our own president won't even come out and decry it.
[01:38:54.565 --> 01:38:57.507]  The Defense Department spokesman said that's not his job.
[01:38:57.707 --> 01:38:59.088]  Well, what is his job?
[01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:01.110]  Molesting children?
[01:39:03.471 --> 01:39:04.132]  Here's some of the video.
[01:39:05.876 --> 01:39:08.478]  I don't know how to do it.
[01:39:11.901 --> 01:39:15.044]  I don't know how to do it.
[01:39:18.427 --> 01:39:19.468]  I don't know how to do it.
[01:39:23.824 --> 01:39:24.264]  I don't know.
[01:39:24.284 --> 01:39:25.025]  I've already told you.
[01:39:25.045 --> 01:39:25.425]  You're the boss.
[01:39:25.445 --> 01:39:25.745]  I'm the boss.
[01:39:26.826 --> 01:39:27.166]  I'm the boss.
[01:39:28.727 --> 01:39:28.987]  I'm the boss.
[01:39:30.287 --> 01:39:30.768]  I'm the boss.
[01:39:31.828 --> 01:39:32.148]  I'm the boss.
[01:39:32.949 --> 01:39:33.449]  I'm the boss.
[01:39:34.309 --> 01:39:34.669]  I'm the boss.
[01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:35.890]  I'm the boss.
[01:39:37.071 --> 01:39:37.591]  I'm the boss.
[01:39:38.751 --> 01:39:39.112]  I'm the boss.
[01:39:40.832 --> 01:39:41.153]  I'm the boss.
[01:39:45.815 --> 01:39:46.115]  I'm the boss.
[01:39:47.056 --> 01:39:47.596]  I'm the boss.
[01:39:48.496 --> 01:39:48.816]  I'm the boss.
[01:39:48.836 --> 01:39:49.257]  I'm the boss.
[01:39:49.897 --> 01:39:51.547]   I'm I'm not a kid!
[01:39:51.587 --> 01:39:53.288]  I'm a grown man!
[01:39:53.348 --> 01:39:53.788]  You're not a kid!
[01:39:53.889 --> 01:39:56.851]  I'm not a kid!
[01:39:59.653 --> 01:40:01.154]  I'm not a kid!
[01:40:04.056 --> 01:40:14.056]  [INAUDIBLE]
[01:40:14.056 --> 01:40:25.376]   So they bloody his lip, punch him in the eye, and then later drag him off and take him away.
[01:40:25.376 --> 01:40:35.376]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:40:27.068 --> 01:40:28.348]  And these are Chinese people.
[01:40:28.388 --> 01:40:33.571]  You can see the police are embarrassed they're doing this, but GG Ping, their body language is they hate doing it.
[01:40:35.011 --> 01:40:42.155]  But they're ordered to do this and bend people over on park benches and shove stuff up their rear end with combat robots flying around.
[01:40:42.355 --> 01:40:45.837]  And those humans, those police, will soon be replaced by robots.
[01:40:48.393 --> 01:40:49.334]  We're not robots.
[01:40:49.354 --> 01:40:50.514]  We're made by God.
[01:40:50.754 --> 01:40:56.417]  We follow God's directives, and God gave us free will, but we can follow God's blueprint and God's path.
[01:40:58.698 --> 01:41:00.659]  It's time to say no to Klaus Schwab.
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:02.680]  It's time to say no to the New World Order.
[01:41:02.981 --> 01:41:05.802]  It's time to say no to Justin Trudeau.
[01:41:05.902 --> 01:41:07.643]  It's time to say no.
[01:41:08.183 --> 01:41:17.268]  Project Veritas documents child sex slaves in Austin as young as six-year-olds, run by the Democrats, being pimped out to be raped.
[01:41:18.885 --> 01:41:19.765]  Where's the governor?
[01:41:20.286 --> 01:41:21.446]  Where's the state police?
[01:41:21.826 --> 01:41:22.927]  Where's the Austin police?
[01:41:22.987 --> 01:41:26.648]  I'll tell you, Austin police aren't allowed to even respond to burglaries now!
[01:41:29.389 --> 01:41:30.310]  You say, why would they do that?
[01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:35.932]  Because while you're busy getting robbed, they're going to be kidnapping your kids and raping the hell out of them.
[01:41:35.952 --> 01:41:38.333]  I don't mean the police, I mean the Democrats.
[01:41:38.773 --> 01:41:40.514]  The Democrats are the demon-crats.
[01:41:41.014 --> 01:41:42.095]  They are the Satanists.
[01:41:43.971 --> 01:41:46.052]  And it's time to wake up and decide which side you're on.
[01:41:46.492 --> 01:41:49.493]  Republicans ain't perfect, but man, they're light years better than Democrats.
[01:41:49.833 --> 01:41:52.995]  The Democrats are an organized, satanic death cult.
[01:41:53.175 --> 01:41:54.095]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[01:41:53.914 --> 01:41:57.595]  I know it's hard.
[01:41:57.595 --> 01:42:10.634]   I know it's hard when you're not an able person to admit this is all going on but it is.
[01:42:10.634 --> 01:42:12.634]  but it is.
[01:42:12.050 --> 01:42:16.972]  It's getting worse and worse, and now it's breaking through the service, trying to take us over, and we can't let it win.
[01:42:17.912 --> 01:42:18.872]  We will prevail.
[01:42:19.073 --> 01:42:19.713]  It will fall.
[01:42:19.773 --> 01:42:20.353]  It will fail.
[01:42:21.213 --> 01:42:21.934]  It always does.
[01:42:21.954 --> 01:42:24.515]  The question is how far will it run before we stop it?
[01:42:25.215 --> 01:42:30.817]  God gives us free will and the power to stop it and dominion over the earth, but we've got to declare it.
[01:42:30.838 --> 01:42:39.710]   I want to go back to your phone calls and some other big reports coming up, but I There's so many here that are so keen, I don't want to take your calls.
[01:42:41.191 --> 01:42:49.157]  You look at them bringing out a poison shot they know in their own documents before they gave it was going to cause heart attacks and mass death and erase your immune system and record, you know, illnesses.
[01:42:50.098 --> 01:42:58.905]  I've got all the new studies out, a major British study, four times more likely to be hospitalized or die of not just the COVID but any flu or cold.
[01:43:00.446 --> 01:43:01.487]  If you've had even one shot.
[01:43:01.507 --> 01:43:04.109]  If you've had two, it's way over ten times.
[01:43:05.130 --> 01:43:06.952]  If you've had three, you're dead at the door now.
[01:43:07.714 --> 01:43:08.655]  I got it right here on the stack.
[01:43:09.315 --> 01:43:10.356]  Prestigious reports!
[01:43:11.617 --> 01:43:16.299]  And you go, why would they do this and admit it in previous documents before they even rolled it out?
[01:43:16.399 --> 01:43:18.000]  October 2000, CDC document.
[01:43:18.221 --> 01:43:23.064]  And then why would they tell you later it's all in the SPARS 2025-2028 war game?
[01:43:25.165 --> 01:43:27.827]  By the Rockefeller Foundation and John Hopkins and the rest of them.
[01:43:28.187 --> 01:43:34.731]  How they'd roll this out and do it and then use it to discredit the governments who they had do it.
[01:43:35.942 --> 01:43:37.904]  So they all implode and fall into bedlam.
[01:43:38.584 --> 01:43:40.125]  So you're like, oh wait, the government's good?
[01:43:40.165 --> 01:43:40.946]  I thought it just killed us.
[01:43:41.306 --> 01:43:42.848]  It's criminals in the government.
[01:43:43.188 --> 01:43:48.532]  We need limited government, but they want to implode it, so there's no government, so then they bring in their government.
[01:43:48.732 --> 01:43:54.877]  Just like, oh, defund the police, so everything falls apart, and a year later they bring in their new police, and you're 50 times worse off.
[01:43:56.539 --> 01:43:58.060]  This is how they get total control.
[01:43:58.781 --> 01:44:01.523]  It's very simple, it's a blueprint, it's happening.
[01:44:03.063 --> 01:44:06.804]  And remember, only 1 out of every 100 deaths gets reported on VAERS.
[01:44:08.305 --> 01:44:10.545]  Alright, so let's continue, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:10.545 --> 01:44:15.024]  This video is on InfoWars.com.
[01:44:15.024 --> 01:44:17.744]  My boy is dead from the vaccine, F.U. Trudeau.
[01:44:17.744 --> 01:44:19.185]  Angry Dad tells Trudeau.
[01:44:19.185 --> 01:44:24.305]   A distraught father who lost his 17-year-old son after the COVID injection delivers a powerful message.
[01:44:24.305 --> 01:44:24.945]  Here it is.
[01:44:24.945 --> 01:44:31.905]  Uh, uh, uh, uh, I didn't call anyone names.
[01:44:31.992 --> 01:44:32.813]  Yeah, you did.
[01:44:34.233 --> 01:44:35.213]  Are you delusional?
[01:44:36.413 --> 01:44:38.093]  Here's something, I don't know, maybe this will work.
[01:44:38.333 --> 01:44:43.134]  How about you tell fucking Pfizer, fuck you Pfizer, the deal's off, you're hurting my people.
[01:44:43.734 --> 01:44:48.875]  I know people personally that would maybe forgive you, who hate you right now.
[01:44:49.675 --> 01:44:50.296]  Personally!
[01:44:51.196 --> 01:44:53.016]  But no, you just keep pushing it, don't you?
[01:44:53.316 --> 01:44:58.277]  You won't fucking admit that one single person has died from the vaccine, will ya?! !
[01:44:59.394 --> 01:45:00.554]  You won't even tell the truth.
[01:45:00.855 --> 01:45:01.775]  You're for Canadians.
[01:45:02.055 --> 01:45:02.975]  Uh, I love Canadians.
[01:45:03.255 --> 01:45:04.396]  No you fucking don't!
[01:45:04.816 --> 01:45:06.077]  Tell the fucking truth!
[01:45:07.357 --> 01:45:10.498]  My boy is dead from your vaccine!
[01:45:12.599 --> 01:45:13.259]  Fuck you!
[01:45:17.081 --> 01:45:18.381]  Dead from microcarditis.
[01:45:20.902 --> 01:45:22.883]  And the numbers show us it's not just our opinion.
[01:45:24.599 --> 01:45:27.981]  More than a 10,000% increase in heart attacks in boys and girls.
[01:45:28.701 --> 01:45:29.621]  Never before even happened.
[01:45:30.322 --> 01:45:31.362]  Now they're dead everywhere.
[01:45:31.622 --> 01:45:35.924]  But it's all his big powerful... He sits there and he loves it!
[01:45:36.184 --> 01:45:37.425]  He's killing people!
[01:45:37.665 --> 01:45:39.086]  He's really somebody!
[01:45:39.346 --> 01:45:40.666]  He ruined lives!
[01:45:40.966 --> 01:45:42.307]  You're like, why would somebody be like that?
[01:45:42.487 --> 01:45:44.408]  Why did Jeffrey Dahmer drug and rape people?
[01:45:44.828 --> 01:45:45.789]  Because he's evil!
[01:45:46.509 --> 01:45:47.569]  Why did Hitler do what he did?
[01:45:47.609 --> 01:45:48.350]  Why did Stalin?
[01:45:48.550 --> 01:45:49.050]  Why did Mao?
[01:45:49.290 --> 01:45:51.051]  Because they like it!
[01:45:52.691 --> 01:45:55.973]  But I'll tell you, Jeffrey Dahmer and Adolf Hitler aren't the problem.
[01:45:56.934 --> 01:46:03.659]  The problem are people like us that put up with this crap and sit there and let them get away with this.
[01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:09.152]  I'm going to explain what I just said two minutes ago before I played that clip.
[01:46:09.672 --> 01:46:14.535]  They want us to blow up and burn up police stations and shoot random people and all go crazy when we learn about this.
[01:46:14.595 --> 01:46:15.235]  It's all in the plan.
[01:46:15.716 --> 01:46:16.916]  No, we don't shoot cops.
[01:46:17.297 --> 01:46:18.477]  We don't burn up random stuff.
[01:46:18.758 --> 01:46:25.502]  We burn up the New World Order politically like laser beams, exposing them and demonizing them for what they've done.
[01:46:25.882 --> 01:46:28.964]  And then we take over our governments, but peacefully.
[01:46:29.244 --> 01:46:30.885]  And then we have big ass trials.
[01:46:30.985 --> 01:46:32.346]  And then you're going to get your vengeance.
[01:46:32.606 --> 01:46:41.891]  To scare all the other Satanists, and we're gonna march them up there in public hearings after they've had their damn trials, and we're gonna kick those levers and break their necks at the end of ropes.
[01:46:42.572 --> 01:46:46.714]  And I'm not a vengeful person, but I'm not gonna call for anything I wouldn't do.
[01:46:47.034 --> 01:46:57.220]  And once they've had the Nuremberg trials, I'll put on that black mask as an executioner, and I'll sit up there all day long, and I'll kick those levers, and I'll snap their necks all day long!
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:00.502]  I volunteered to hang 10,000 of them myself!
[01:47:03.598 --> 01:47:05.599]  And I volunteer to cut their bodies down!
[01:47:05.619 --> 01:47:08.842]  I volunteer!
[01:47:08.862 --> 01:47:10.883]  And I want them to know that.
[01:47:11.384 --> 01:47:12.524]  I will kill you!
[01:47:12.544 --> 01:47:14.466]  I will kill you!
[01:47:14.726 --> 01:47:17.308]  But I will do it politically, and I will do it correctly.
[01:47:17.528 --> 01:47:18.709]  And you will die!
[01:47:20.230 --> 01:47:21.531]  You want to kill our children?
[01:47:22.131 --> 01:47:23.912]  You want to inject black people with syphilis?
[01:47:24.213 --> 01:47:26.274]  You want to sit there and fill us full of prions?
[01:47:26.594 --> 01:47:27.615]  You will die!
[01:47:32.062 --> 01:47:36.846]  That arrogant monster Fauci sits up there, getting off on all the evil he's committed.
[01:47:38.387 --> 01:47:39.829]  Don't worry about him, folks.
[01:47:39.889 --> 01:47:40.729]  God's gonna get him.
[01:47:41.410 --> 01:47:42.431]  Vengeance is God's.
[01:47:44.132 --> 01:47:49.136]  But I just want to be on record that I'm not gonna blow anything up, or shoot anybody, or commit any crimes.
[01:47:50.177 --> 01:47:51.418]  But I want these Nazis 2.0.
[01:47:52.519 --> 01:47:54.241]  I want these globalist Joseph Mengele's 2.0.
[01:47:55.302 --> 01:47:57.644]  I want them indicted.
[01:47:59.085 --> 01:48:00.086]  I want them tried.
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:05.862]  And I want them publicly executed.
[01:48:08.103 --> 01:48:27.393]  Because they're executing us in front of the whole world, and they think it's funny, and I've met so many parents who's 10-year-old, or 14-year-old, or 16-year-old, or 17-year-old, that I've met personally in Austin, who were healthy, playing sports, no heart deformities, dead within days of the Pfizer or Moderna shot.
[01:48:29.321 --> 01:48:35.426]  Everybody else is too cowardly to call them out and say they deserve the death penalty for what they've done.
[01:48:36.127 --> 01:48:44.173]  If we could get a hold of the scientists that injected more than 10,000 black men with syphilis, I say we hang them too.
[01:48:44.193 --> 01:48:46.155]  You're like, well, of course we hang them.
[01:48:46.215 --> 01:48:47.977]  Well, they're doing it on a bigger scale than everybody right now.
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:53.621]  They always test it out on the black people first.
[01:48:53.661 --> 01:48:54.242]  We all know that.
[01:48:55.874 --> 01:48:57.695]  I don't give a damn whether you're black or white.
[01:48:57.715 --> 01:48:59.575]  I don't care what color your skin is.
[01:48:59.915 --> 01:49:04.137]  You got a soul God made, and you don't deserve to be killed by these people.
[01:49:04.377 --> 01:49:09.278]  So let's stop fighting with each other over what color we are, and let's recognize the new world order as our enemy.
[01:49:10.018 --> 01:49:25.083]  And let's get busy at city councils and county commissions and school boards talking about this, and what they've done, and that we're aware of Agenda 2030, and how they control over governments, and the human smuggling, and the human trafficking, and the pedophilia, and let's just expose them everywhere until everybody knows!
[01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:37.228]  No matter how much election fraud they got, we're going to take our governments back, we're going to take the Justice Department back, we're going to take our local prosecutors back from George Soros that said rounding up Jews was the happiest time of his life.
[01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:45.254]  And we're going to exact justice.
[01:49:47.516 --> 01:49:47.936]  Justice.
[01:49:48.016 --> 01:49:50.678]  And we're going to have trials, and all of us are going to come out with what they did.
[01:49:51.439 --> 01:49:52.459]  So important to have those.
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:54.141]  We're not like them.
[01:49:54.241 --> 01:49:55.101]  We'll have real trials.
[01:49:56.018 --> 01:50:08.805]  They'll put on their defenses and as soon as the dominoes start to fall they're all going to turn on each other and all confess everything and we'll find out just how bad it is and then we'll execute their leadership.
[01:50:12.507 --> 01:50:13.147]  We will do it.
[01:50:13.267 --> 01:50:14.728]  They will pay for what they've done.
[01:50:15.708 --> 01:50:16.669]  They will hang high.
[01:50:17.529 --> 01:50:18.310]  Hanging is the way to do it.
[01:50:18.330 --> 01:50:20.611]  We're going to string them up.
[01:50:22.051 --> 01:50:23.551]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back.
[01:50:23.651 --> 01:50:24.892]  Infowars.com.
[01:50:25.412 --> 01:50:26.432]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:50:27.553 --> 01:50:28.813]  Heroes die by the sword.
[01:50:28.853 --> 01:50:29.553]  They don't get that.
[01:50:29.573 --> 01:50:30.313]  They get the rope.
[01:50:30.734 --> 01:50:31.234]  Stay with us.
[01:50:32.434 --> 01:50:39.876]  Joseph Mingula, that killed thousands of people in secret Nazi experiments, got away and ran to South America.
[01:50:41.017 --> 01:50:43.277]  That could have been captured and tried at Nuremberg.
[01:50:43.737 --> 01:50:45.198]  I believe he should have been executed.
[01:50:47.281 --> 01:50:49.842]  So what I said earlier is what needs to be said.
[01:50:49.862 --> 01:50:51.663]  I don't say it to act macho or powerful.
[01:50:51.703 --> 01:50:55.304]  In fact, it puts me even more dead center in these people's attacks.
[01:50:55.644 --> 01:51:03.768]  But God's watching, and God says, you need to say what needs to happen to them, but it needs to be done lawfully and constitutionally.
[01:51:03.908 --> 01:51:09.370]  None of us should attack any of these people until we've taken back the government, until they've been arrested and convicted.
[01:51:11.132 --> 01:51:14.513]  And they need to know, and they need to understand, that we're not afraid to die.
[01:51:15.233 --> 01:51:18.554]  They're killing children, they're killing innocents, they are attacking us with bio-weapons.
[01:51:19.914 --> 01:51:27.495]  And we need to recognize it, and speak the truth, and as men, we need to stand up and tell the truth about these people.
[01:51:31.336 --> 01:51:34.557]  Now they already know, they're already scared, they've already sussed it, they've already smelled it.
[01:51:36.052 --> 01:51:38.573]  And everything about what Infowars does is about defeating them.
[01:51:38.993 --> 01:51:39.874]  They can smell it.
[01:51:39.934 --> 01:51:41.194]  If they kill me, they lose.
[01:51:41.514 --> 01:51:43.275]  If they set me up and put me in prison, they lose.
[01:51:43.575 --> 01:51:44.376]  Just like they do with you.
[01:51:45.876 --> 01:51:47.097]  But they'll still make their move.
[01:51:47.877 --> 01:51:50.398]  And understand, whatever happens to me, I did the right thing.
[01:51:50.578 --> 01:51:51.359]  I was honorable.
[01:51:51.659 --> 01:51:52.979]  No matter what they say, it's a lie.
[01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:55.981]  I didn't back down at the moment of truth.
[01:51:56.621 --> 01:51:58.202]  And that's all that really matters in this life.
[01:51:58.602 --> 01:52:00.783]  Because this life is only a very short test.
[01:52:02.881 --> 01:52:09.405]  You should thank God every day you're not Klaus Schwab, or Justin Trudeau, or Bill Gates, or Lord Rothschild, or any of these people.
[01:52:09.645 --> 01:52:12.907]  Because justice is justice and must be served here.
[01:52:13.226 --> 01:52:17.626]   But the real justice will be served when they face the almighty creator of the universe
[01:52:17.626 --> 01:52:20.905]   for what they did with their free will and how they attacked a bunch of men,
[01:52:20.905 --> 01:52:24.746]   women and children with poisoned crap so they could feel powerful.
[01:52:24.746 --> 01:52:34.905]   I volunteer once they're convicted to be an executioner because I don't want to be near them.
[01:52:35.164 --> 01:52:35.884]  I don't want to see them.
[01:52:35.984 --> 01:52:36.725]  I don't want to watch it.
[01:52:36.784 --> 01:52:43.784]   But I can't call for their conviction and their execution unless I'm saying I'm willing to take part in that.
[01:52:43.784 --> 01:52:51.784]   And I just want them to know, you're not going to just kill people all day long and get away with it.
[01:52:51.784 --> 01:53:01.784]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:52:56.681 --> 01:52:57.362]  You want us to die?
[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:00.221]  He wants to roll over?
[01:53:00.601 --> 01:53:01.181]  Give you the world?
[01:53:02.282 --> 01:53:03.123]  Let you rape our kids?
[01:53:06.025 --> 01:53:08.728]  I'd die inside before I could turn the world over to these people.
[01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:12.331]  I don't do this because I even hate these people.
[01:53:12.691 --> 01:53:20.277]  I do this because God's watching, and God tells me, if you don't fight this, I'm gonna smash you flatter than a pancake.
[01:53:23.219 --> 01:53:24.000]  Because you're mine.
[01:53:25.201 --> 01:53:25.782]  I know you.
[01:53:26.442 --> 01:53:27.263]  You made a deal with me.
[01:53:31.132 --> 01:53:32.173]  I gave you the discernment.
[01:53:32.733 --> 01:53:33.614]  I gave you the power.
[01:53:34.595 --> 01:53:37.317]  Not to sit around and use it for earthly crap!
[01:53:39.018 --> 01:53:41.018]  to prosecute the war.
[01:53:41.018 --> 01:53:47.617]  Satan fears the righteous.
[01:53:47.617 --> 01:53:52.417]  [END]
[01:53:52.328 --> 01:53:54.230]  It's time to stop acting like we're the losers.
[01:53:55.791 --> 01:53:58.113]  It's time for us to start acting like what we are, the winners.
[01:53:58.213 --> 01:53:59.013]  And I'm done ranting.
[01:53:59.033 --> 01:53:59.754]  I'm gonna go to your calls.
[01:54:00.885 --> 01:54:03.147]  Hearing the anger in that father's voice really got me going.
[01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:10.736]  And that pretty boy, Kendall, up there smirking and giggling and laughing.
[01:54:11.296 --> 01:54:14.239]  These people are beyond reprobate.
[01:54:18.063 --> 01:54:19.285]  They're beyond God's reach.
[01:54:21.015 --> 01:54:27.244]   They have that sick, smiley, demonic look on their face, like they just know it's so good and so fun what they've
[01:54:27.244 --> 01:54:27.814]  done.
[01:54:27.814 --> 01:54:30.215]  Because they're really whispering past the graveyard.
[01:54:30.215 --> 01:54:35.414]   They're really pretending like they're the winners, when they're the losers.
[01:54:35.414 --> 01:54:41.015]  Diz in Nevada. Diz, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:54:41.015 --> 01:54:46.015]  I got a quick plug. Kind of a plug, because they're not up.
[01:54:46.025 --> 01:54:49.246]  We have a new shipping company, soon we'll be backing them, fullrestore.com.
[01:54:49.065 --> 01:54:50.805]  some of the best supplements I've ever taken.
[01:54:50.805 --> 01:54:55.045]  I've been studying herbology for like a decade now.
[01:54:55.045 --> 01:54:59.845]   And I went to go order them last night and they're not on your site anymore.
[01:54:59.845 --> 01:55:01.805]  Yeah, they're at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:55:01.805 --> 01:55:02.925]  We have a new shipping company.
[01:55:02.925 --> 01:55:05.166]  Soon we'll be backing them forward to our dot com.
[01:55:05.166 --> 01:55:15.404]   My dad hired a guy with a degree from A&M, a chemist that makes some of the top supplements
[01:55:15.404 --> 01:55:16.666]  for Whole Foods.
[01:55:16.666 --> 01:55:21.666]  And he made the whole rocket rest and all that stuff.
[01:55:21.666 --> 01:55:23.425]  And we're gonna be bringing that back.
[01:55:24.043 --> 01:55:34.667]  Awesome, and then you should tweak the alpha power, because that zinc oxide is an inorganic form of zinc, and it has no affinity with our body, but on to Trump.
[01:55:35.362 --> 01:55:39.564]  I'm glad you started bringing this up, because would he be part of the 10,000 that you're willing to hang?
[01:55:39.584 --> 01:55:44.627]  Because he's filing on the vaccines as well, on the shots, all the children that are being maimed and murdered.
[01:55:45.088 --> 01:55:51.011]  And also, he calls us little group of people when we started booing him at his crowds.
[01:55:51.051 --> 01:55:57.635]  That sounds a lot like Justin Trudeau when he's saying that there's small fringe minorities, that's a bunch of racist misogynists and stuff.
[01:55:59.077 --> 01:56:02.379]  I want to be clear.
[01:56:02.439 --> 01:56:03.419]  The globalist hate Trump.
[01:56:03.499 --> 01:56:05.139]  I don't think Trump is consciously a bad person.
[01:56:05.179 --> 01:56:07.220]  I'm not saying who needs to be executed.
[01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:17.544]  I'm saying the people that are involved consciously promoting this, that were part of the plan to release the bioweapon, to give it gain of function, to then push vaccines they knew would hurt us.
[01:56:17.884 --> 01:56:19.104]  Those are crimes against humanity.
[01:56:19.164 --> 01:56:20.405]  Those are death penalty offenses.
[01:56:20.905 --> 01:56:22.686]  And I'm just simply saying they're murdering us.
[01:56:23.107 --> 01:56:24.888]  We should talk about what the penalties are for that.
[01:56:24.948 --> 01:56:39.258]  But yeah, if it comes out in court with proof that anybody, I don't care who they are, you, me, the Easter Bunny, anybody, if they consciously know, like Fauci, and it's proven in court, then, I mean, you don't just put them in prison.
[01:56:39.638 --> 01:56:40.539]  That's the death penalty.
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:43.521]  Yeah, I 100% agree.
[01:56:43.581 --> 01:56:48.845]  And honestly, I don't really care about the trials and convictions because the whole judicial system has been taken over.
[01:56:50.054 --> 01:56:56.576]  No, I hear you, but once we become them and we don't want to blow up a building or shoot anybody, they're going to do that anyways and blame it on us.
[01:56:57.036 --> 01:56:58.157]  We don't want any violence.
[01:56:58.197 --> 01:57:01.498]  We want to take control of the system, and then we want to bring them to justice.
[01:57:02.558 --> 01:57:07.200]  Well, if we're going to take control of the system, we need to do it once.
[01:57:07.260 --> 01:57:08.940]  Nobody is talking about that in politics.
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:10.120]  No, I hear you, Diz.
[01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:11.281]  I appreciate your call, brother.
[01:57:11.321 --> 01:57:11.881]  God bless you.
[01:57:12.441 --> 01:57:13.181]  They are killing us.
[01:57:13.201 --> 01:57:14.382]  We've got to have a discussion about this.
[01:57:15.498 --> 01:57:19.379]  If a foreign enemy is bombing you with bombers, you say, you know, we should fight back.
[01:57:19.439 --> 01:57:21.280]  I mean, they're bombing us with bioweapons.
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:22.220]  I mean, it's here.
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:24.541]  We need a sense of urgency.
[01:57:24.781 --> 01:57:27.641]  I raise these topics just to have a sense of urgency, folks.
[01:57:28.021 --> 01:57:28.982]  Go to city councils.
[01:57:29.042 --> 01:57:29.762]  Go to school boards.
[01:57:30.202 --> 01:57:30.582]  Speak up.
[01:57:30.602 --> 01:57:32.203]  They're trying to make the shots mandatory for kids.
[01:57:32.563 --> 01:57:33.643]  Point out how poisonous they are.
[01:57:33.943 --> 01:57:35.304]  Show the British Medical Journal reports.
[01:57:35.664 --> 01:57:36.324]  Show the facts.
[01:57:36.364 --> 01:57:38.184]  We've got to save people with the info.
[01:57:38.484 --> 01:57:39.785]  That's more powerful than violence.
[01:57:41.445 --> 01:57:43.386]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Minnesota.
[01:57:43.406 --> 01:57:43.946]  Tom, go ahead.
[01:57:45.905 --> 01:57:47.506]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[01:57:47.866 --> 01:57:52.388]  I have a situation where a family member is being forced to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:57:53.628 --> 01:57:56.429]  Filing for a religious exemption is really not an option.
[01:57:56.689 --> 01:57:57.830]  It'll likely be denied.
[01:57:59.090 --> 01:58:02.152]  What can you tell me about the Novavax vaccine?
[01:58:02.612 --> 01:58:02.832]  Sure.
[01:58:03.112 --> 01:58:04.953]  Is your family member in the military or where are they?
[01:58:06.557 --> 01:58:10.341]  Um, no, this has to do with USCIS.
[01:58:10.821 --> 01:58:11.742]  Well, here's an example.
[01:58:12.302 --> 01:58:22.313]   I was in an AT&T store three weeks ago and there was one guy with a mask because my phone was broken and I was getting another one and he goes, Hey, you're Alex Jones.
[01:58:22.353 --> 01:58:23.473]  Why are you the only guy wearing a mask?
[01:58:23.493 --> 01:58:27.396]  He said, well, if I don't wear it, I'm fired because I'm not vaccinated.
[01:58:27.536 --> 01:58:29.857]  If I take it off for 30 seconds, I'm fired.
[01:58:30.277 --> 01:58:31.198]  There's no law.
[01:58:31.318 --> 01:58:32.198]  It's all made up.
[01:58:32.859 --> 01:58:33.979]  The vaccine doesn't work.
[01:58:34.039 --> 01:58:34.880]  It's not a vaccine.
[01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:35.640]  It's a fraud.
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:37.762]  So people just got up.
[01:58:37.822 --> 01:58:37.982]  I mean.
[01:58:38.502 --> 01:58:42.987]  You know, even the federal judge said three months ago, you can't make the military take the shot.
[01:58:43.287 --> 01:58:44.048]  They're still doing it.
[01:58:44.328 --> 01:58:45.049]  It's illegal.
[01:58:45.629 --> 01:58:46.811]  It's a crime against humanity.
[01:58:47.271 --> 01:58:54.298]  And Lloyd Austin, the Secretary of Defense, is committing Nuremberg-violating attacks with experimental shots on our troops.
[01:58:54.639 --> 01:58:55.900]  He is Joseph Mingala.
[01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:59.163]  Just because he's black doesn't mean he can't be beyond Joseph Mingala.
[01:58:59.464 --> 01:59:00.665]  He is Joseph Mingala.
[01:59:04.847 --> 01:59:08.868]  So I don't know what to tell them, threaten the lawsuit, whatever.
[01:59:09.048 --> 01:59:12.248]  They don't have a right to put any shot in you, much less an experimental one.
[01:59:12.268 --> 01:59:12.848]  Does that make sense?
[01:59:14.429 --> 01:59:14.809]  Yeah.
[01:59:15.109 --> 01:59:19.350]  Do you know if any are less harmful or anything else I can look for?
[01:59:19.530 --> 01:59:22.250]  Brother, the globalists told them the four vaccines to make.
[01:59:22.290 --> 01:59:24.870]  Two are virus vectors, two are mRNA, none of them are vaccines.
[01:59:25.491 --> 01:59:28.311]  Two are virus vector, two are mRNA.
[01:59:28.331 --> 01:59:33.512]  They both produce a prion protein that starts self-replicating in the body.
[01:59:35.166 --> 01:59:41.952]  And they're growing a matrix of crystals in your body that cause blood clots to take you over.
[01:59:43.013 --> 01:59:44.154]  And so none of them are safe.
[01:59:44.394 --> 01:59:45.555]  They're all pure evil.
[01:59:45.575 --> 01:59:47.097]  None of them were properly studied.
[01:59:47.857 --> 01:59:53.222]  And so no, there is no shot that's... I mean, don't... The Moderna is three times stronger than Pfizer.
[01:59:54.834 --> 01:59:58.235]  So they're making you take one, which you should resist, like a bullet in your head.
[01:59:59.355 --> 02:00:02.056]  The Moderna is stronger than the Pfizer.
[02:00:02.076 --> 02:00:02.816]  It's the same shot.
[02:00:03.596 --> 02:00:04.717]  It's the equivalent of four shots.
[02:00:05.277 --> 02:00:08.298]  The virus vector ones are super bad news as well.
[02:00:08.938 --> 02:00:11.099]  They program your cells to create the spike protein.
[02:00:11.139 --> 02:00:12.379]  So do what you got to do.
[02:00:12.419 --> 02:00:13.319]  I appreciate your call, Tom.
[02:00:13.759 --> 02:00:14.339]  We're going to break.
[02:00:14.359 --> 02:00:15.080]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:18.160]  Xi Jinping will be brought low by God.
[02:00:18.180 --> 02:00:23.642]  Barack Obama will be brought low by God.
[02:00:25.046 --> 02:00:35.169]  Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, the filthy, degenerate, false king of England, Charles III, will be brought low.
[02:00:37.409 --> 02:00:38.270]  They're not the king.
[02:00:39.410 --> 02:00:40.310]  They're not the rulers.
[02:00:41.250 --> 02:00:43.250]  or nothing but Satan's pants.
[02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:50.250]  All right, final segment, folks.
[02:00:50.250 --> 02:01:00.250]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:00:52.714 --> 02:00:54.254]  We've got a great guest host taking over.
[02:00:55.877 --> 02:00:57.334]  I got a lot of calls I want to jam in here.
[02:00:58.342 --> 02:00:59.262]  I also want to hit this.
[02:00:59.283 --> 02:01:08.467]  30 years ago, Dr. Robert Wilner exposed Fauci with his AZT that they knew didn't help people, just like Remdesivir saved no one and killed hundreds of thousands.
[02:01:08.687 --> 02:01:19.253]  This is all part of their plan to set the precedent to kill people and not have the medical system expose them so that they get more power and control and have corrupted and can blackmail those individuals.
[02:01:19.733 --> 02:01:20.914]  That's what this is all about.
[02:01:21.414 --> 02:01:27.317]  Just like China doesn't attack with troops and uniforms, they attack with armed men in white outfits saying they're medical, but they're not medical.
[02:01:30.202 --> 02:01:37.148]  The Nazis, the Communists, they all come with a biomedical tyranny because we're trained to accept medical as our saviors.
[02:01:37.208 --> 02:01:38.689]  And most medical people are great folks.
[02:01:38.989 --> 02:01:40.891]  It's good medical people exposing this whole thing.
[02:01:42.713 --> 02:01:45.615]  We have free shipping again, on orders for $50 or more.
[02:01:45.835 --> 02:01:47.597]  The regular shipping is about half what it was.
[02:01:47.617 --> 02:01:49.939]  We got a much better deal with a big national group.
[02:01:50.019 --> 02:01:50.439]  It's great.
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:56.885]  And we've got Vitamin Mineral Fusion, DNA Force Plus, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Supramel Vitality, Supraphenol Vitality.
[02:01:57.685 --> 02:01:59.808]   We've got the Ultra 12.
[02:01:59.888 --> 02:02:03.010]  We've got all of it at InfoWarsTore.com, but it's all selling out quick.
[02:02:03.370 --> 02:02:06.111]  A bunch of stuff's already sold out, like X2, X3, Boudreaux, Slingium.
[02:02:06.492 --> 02:02:10.293]  But we're going to keep it all on sale for up to 60% off with promo code 7076.
[02:02:10.854 --> 02:02:11.574]  Double pay 3 points.
[02:02:11.914 --> 02:02:13.115]  Biggest sale, total clearance.
[02:02:13.135 --> 02:02:14.636]  We need the funds, plus they're great products.
[02:02:14.956 --> 02:02:15.616]  We know you'll get them.
[02:02:15.636 --> 02:02:17.297]  Those on the fence, get them, love them, use them.

[02:02:31.927 --> 02:02:33.927]  I want to thank you all for the great job you've done.
[02:02:33.927 --> 02:02:37.927]  Jim in Arkansas, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:02:37.927 --> 02:02:41.927]  Hi, Alex. You know what? A lot of folks are calling a rant.
[02:02:41.927 --> 02:02:43.927]  I'd just like to refer to it as the truth.
[02:02:43.927 --> 02:02:48.927]  I'd like to start off with a plug for the brain force.
[02:02:49.659 --> 02:02:59.481]  It's a great item and people in corporate America, you want to impress your boss, your manager, director, next time you have a meeting with them, make sure you take some BrainForce.
[02:03:00.081 --> 02:03:04.802]  Your brain will be firing on all cylinders and you'll stand out in a good way.
[02:03:05.142 --> 02:03:05.662]  Absolutely.
[02:03:06.542 --> 02:03:11.003]  Now what I called for was, I power my home with solar panels.
[02:03:11.023 --> 02:03:13.078]   There's a lot of Folks in the U.S.
[02:03:13.138 --> 02:03:14.438]  does, and businesses.
[02:03:14.478 --> 02:03:20.440]  And then we have people who are blocking out the sun, even getting awards for blocking out the sun.
[02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:26.241]  Why can't we organize and sue them for blocking out the sun that we're trying to heat?
[02:03:26.261 --> 02:03:27.281]  Well, that's right.
[02:03:27.321 --> 02:03:28.621]  We're not against innovation.
[02:03:28.721 --> 02:03:31.902]  We just don't want them shutting off stuff before the new innovation comes in.
[02:03:31.922 --> 02:03:37.423]  And Bill Gates is involved in a Department of Energy program practicing blocking the sun out.
[02:03:37.443 --> 02:03:38.043]  You're absolutely right.
[02:03:38.283 --> 02:03:39.404]  Who says he owns the sun?
[02:03:39.644 --> 02:03:40.684]  Who says he owns the planet?
[02:03:42.443 --> 02:03:42.843]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:43.123 --> 02:03:47.565]  I was just wondering if it was even possible for a class action lawsuit or something against him.
[02:03:47.585 --> 02:03:48.946]  I think it's way more than possible.
[02:03:49.006 --> 02:03:51.767]  Who says he owns space or owns the sun to block it from us?
[02:03:52.768 --> 02:03:53.068]  Right.
[02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.889]  Right.
[02:03:54.929 --> 02:03:56.590]  Well, I would be more than willing if...
[02:03:57.825 --> 02:04:03.790]  I could get in touch with the correct lawyer to move ahead with that, but that is really irking me.
[02:04:04.010 --> 02:04:06.512]  Well, let me explain this to listeners who don't get it who aren't engineers.
[02:04:06.572 --> 02:04:10.094]  I'm not either, but when I first saw this 15 years ago, Bill Gates and the U.N.
[02:04:10.114 --> 02:04:11.235]  pushing it, I didn't understand it.
[02:04:11.615 --> 02:04:12.376]  Here's the Sun.
[02:04:13.157 --> 02:04:13.897]  Here's Mercury.
[02:04:14.778 --> 02:04:15.458]  Here's Venus.
[02:04:16.399 --> 02:04:16.980]  Here's the Earth.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.120]  You know, the Sun's a lot bigger than that.
[02:04:18.561 --> 02:04:20.362]  And then here's Mars, and it goes on out from there.
[02:04:21.403 --> 02:04:29.122]   How would they put a mirror array of tinfoil that a little bitty thing that would block
[02:04:29.122 --> 02:04:30.123]  the earth?
[02:04:30.123 --> 02:04:35.043]   Well if you put it further out towards the sun in a, I guess they call it geosynchronous
[02:04:35.043 --> 02:04:39.643]   orbit, it would be able to block out large parts of the earth because it's further towards
[02:04:39.643 --> 02:04:40.643]  the sun.
[02:04:40.643 --> 02:04:44.282]   It's like you put your hand in front of a light bulb, even though you're only covering
[02:04:44.282 --> 02:04:46.563]  part of the light bulb, it still covers your whole face.
[02:04:46.563 --> 02:04:47.563]  So it's basically the same thing.
[02:04:47.563 --> 02:04:53.323]   They want to put a bunch of these things in space to block the earth getting sun.
[02:04:53.323 --> 02:04:57.243]  What the hell is that?
[02:04:57.243 --> 02:04:59.203]  It's against us, that's what it is.
[02:04:59.162 --> 02:05:00.663]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[02:05:01.004 --> 02:05:05.567]  I mean, they already said oxygen's bad, carbon dioxide's bad, now they want to go after the sun.
[02:05:06.368 --> 02:05:10.011]  Yeah, everything that we need for life, they're trying to do away with.
[02:05:11.673 --> 02:05:36.358]   They've already done tests with satellites, little ones, and then had monitors on the planet I don't know the technical term for them, but they can actually see that it's actually, like, here's an example, a little bitty airplane at 20,000 feet flies above you, and anybody's ever been in a field sees this huge shadow fly over that's a hundred times bigger than a plane, you go, and you look up and a tiny plane did it, it's because it's in the distance, it's blocking more of the sun from its perspective.
[02:05:36.739 --> 02:05:37.539]  God bless you, brother.
[02:05:37.559 --> 02:05:45.862]  You know, going back to Brain Force Plus, it's just a good clean nootropic, nothing that fries your brain, just good staple stuff that gives you a natural focus.
[02:05:45.902 --> 02:05:46.782]  Thank you so much for the support.
[02:05:47.222 --> 02:05:48.183]  Jefferson in Virginia.
[02:05:48.203 --> 02:05:48.723]  You're on the air.
[02:05:48.763 --> 02:05:49.123]  Go ahead.
[02:05:51.145 --> 02:05:51.625]  Hey, Alex.
[02:05:52.066 --> 02:05:52.826]  I got news for you.
[02:05:54.528 --> 02:05:56.709]  Klar Schwab is less than two miles away from me.
[02:05:56.749 --> 02:05:59.351]  He's in the Waldorf Astoria, which used to be the Trump Hotel.
[02:05:59.411 --> 02:06:01.172]  Right now, I'm like two miles away.
[02:06:01.673 --> 02:06:02.994]  You think I should go Nuremberg him?
[02:06:05.177 --> 02:06:17.381]  I think you should go hit him with the truth, non-violently, and explain that he's a mass murderer, calling for global energy to be cut off that would cause depopulation, and that he shouldn't fly around in private jets while he tells poor people they can't have winter heating.
[02:06:20.342 --> 02:06:21.562]  I was just joking, everybody.
[02:06:21.742 --> 02:06:22.882]  But he's actually here.
[02:06:23.122 --> 02:06:24.663]  I'm actually here, not far from him.
[02:06:24.723 --> 02:06:27.604]  But we're not going to... What's he doing over at the Waldorf Astoria?
[02:06:27.664 --> 02:06:31.085]  I think a whole group of peaceful people should go over there and protest his ass right now.
[02:06:32.652 --> 02:06:36.459]  Yeah, we should all band together and go at least let him know that we know he's there.
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:42.049]  But we're not going to get to a Nuremberg trial peacefully unless the Supreme Court steps in.
[02:06:42.905 --> 02:06:47.147]  And basically nullifies everything that happened from the 2020 election on.
[02:06:47.187 --> 02:06:50.569]  I think there's a case in front of them right now that might make that happen.
[02:06:51.009 --> 02:07:08.732]   It's being waged by the Brunson Brothers, and they basically said because they didn't have the 10-hour or the 10-day inspection period after January 6th that we were shooting for before the protests went into a riot, Because they didn't vote for the 10-day delay, they violated their oath of office.
[02:07:09.012 --> 02:07:11.833]  That's right, but let's go back to what you just said.
[02:07:11.953 --> 02:07:13.314]  It's on Twitter, put it back up.
[02:07:13.374 --> 02:07:15.595]  There's Klaus Schwab in the Waldorf store in Virginia.
[02:07:16.395 --> 02:07:19.496]  Everybody should peacefully go there and protest that mass murder.
[02:07:21.437 --> 02:07:24.058]  They should be there exposing the guy that says he's penetrating our government.
[02:07:24.358 --> 02:07:25.519]  There he is, bigger than Dallas.
[02:07:27.250 --> 02:07:28.911]  Yeah, but that might get hijacked too.
[02:07:28.931 --> 02:07:31.432]  You never know, a provocateur might do something like that.
[02:07:31.452 --> 02:07:32.452]  Look, we're not violent.
[02:07:32.712 --> 02:07:35.873]  So if somebody else goes and is violent to blame us, that's their problem.
[02:07:36.274 --> 02:07:37.294]  I want him to be tried.
[02:07:37.314 --> 02:07:39.715]  I want him to have a jury of his peers against his appeals.
[02:07:40.455 --> 02:07:42.396]  But he is definitely a criminal against humanity.
[02:07:42.696 --> 02:07:43.577]  Thanks for the call, brother.
[02:07:44.537 --> 02:07:45.958]  Put that back on screen, that Virginia deal.
[02:07:48.959 --> 02:07:49.739]  Show the whole tweet, please.
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:52.340]  The tweet address, everything.
[02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:54.301]  That's part of being a public figure.
[02:07:55.341 --> 02:07:56.442]  That's Greg Price's Twitter.
[02:07:57.718 --> 02:07:59.639]  A friend of mine was at the Waldorf Astoria in D.C.
[02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:00.980]  from the Trump Hotel.
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:02.061]  I guess it's not that anymore.
[02:08:02.121 --> 02:08:02.381]  Wow.
[02:08:02.982 --> 02:08:04.603]  And sent me this picture of Klaus Schwab.
[02:08:04.663 --> 02:08:06.123]  I thought that looked like Trump Hotel.
[02:08:07.164 --> 02:08:07.644]  Wow.
[02:08:07.664 --> 02:08:09.065]  That's not even Trump Hotel anymore.
[02:08:09.105 --> 02:08:09.726]  I didn't know that.
[02:08:12.988 --> 02:08:13.948]  Unbelievable.
[02:08:15.069 --> 02:08:16.570]  I've actually sat in that very chair.
[02:08:16.590 --> 02:08:18.511]  Had a drink with Eric Bolling.
[02:08:18.911 --> 02:08:19.392]  I'm not kidding.
[02:08:19.412 --> 02:08:20.272]  I've sat right in that chair.
[02:08:21.033 --> 02:08:21.333]  Wow.
[02:08:21.373 --> 02:08:22.113]  What a small world.
[02:08:22.514 --> 02:08:23.554]  Travis in Utah.
[02:08:23.574 --> 02:08:24.075]  You're on the air.
[02:08:24.115 --> 02:08:24.415]  Go ahead.
[02:08:25.834 --> 02:08:35.363]  Yes, Alex Jones, my little big brother from another mother, my beacon of light and a bastion of sleepy sheep, and I'm proud to be one of the fellow sheepdogs.
[02:08:35.423 --> 02:08:40.448]  I've been listening to you for over 20 years, and I thought I was crazy when I was younger.
[02:08:40.508 --> 02:08:50.418]  My grandma gave me one of the books on your site for sale, None Dare Call It Conspiracy, in the fifth grade, and I've been awake ever since, and I thought I was nuts and saved my sanity.
[02:08:51.019 --> 02:08:59.823]  I'm out here to tell everybody, if you're on the fence believing anything coming out of Alex's mouth, you better pay attention because I'm here to testify.
[02:09:00.083 --> 02:09:13.529]  Every single thing I've heard my whole life has come true to fruition and Alex has just laid it all out there and he's dedicated his life, he's given his life for the rest of us and we all need to get on board and do the same.
[02:09:14.434 --> 02:09:18.996]  Well, I appreciate you, brother, but I'm under attack too, so I mean, why not give my life to save my own life?
[02:09:19.857 --> 02:09:21.137]  To me, it's just self-preservation.
[02:09:21.177 --> 02:09:24.439]  It's not some heroic action, but I hear, well, thank God for your grandmother.
[02:09:24.459 --> 02:09:25.720]  Is she still alive?
[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:35.705]  No, sir, but she taught me about fluoride and the vaccines and all the supplements, every single thing you're doing, along with Mike Adams and Steve Quayle.
[02:09:36.221 --> 02:09:44.023]  I thought she was Bats in the Belfry, so did the rest of the family, and I was lost until I heard you and I listened to you ever since, and it's all true.
[02:09:44.403 --> 02:09:45.864]  Every bit of it.
[02:09:45.884 --> 02:09:50.585]  It's people like your grandmother that woke me up too, so God bless her.
[02:09:50.785 --> 02:09:51.506]  What was her name?
[02:09:51.526 --> 02:09:54.987]  Let's have a little moment of appreciation for your grandmother.
[02:09:55.787 --> 02:09:59.188]  Her name was Ruby Hanson, Salt Lake City, Utah.
[02:09:59.744 --> 02:10:00.765]  Well, God bless Ruby.
[02:10:01.206 --> 02:10:02.507]  She lives on through you, Travis.
[02:10:02.547 --> 02:10:02.908]  Thank you.
[02:10:03.308 --> 02:10:04.029]  We're going to go to break.
[02:10:04.049 --> 02:10:05.871]  Come back with Steve and Melissa, Eric and Lynn.
[02:10:06.231 --> 02:10:07.813]  We have our special guest host coming up.
[02:10:08.614 --> 02:10:08.914]  Wow.
[02:10:10.316 --> 02:10:14.080]  I just want to get down to downtown Austin where they run the child kidnapping rings that Veritas exposed.
[02:10:15.011 --> 02:10:16.452]  You know, not just protest Schwab.
[02:10:16.772 --> 02:10:17.852]  People ought to be down there.
[02:10:17.872 --> 02:10:18.873]  I mean, this is big.
[02:10:18.893 --> 02:10:19.513]  We ought to be mad.
[02:10:19.533 --> 02:10:21.514]  They're kidnapping kids and sex slaving them.
[02:10:21.954 --> 02:10:23.775]  I mean, again, we just get comfortable.
[02:10:23.815 --> 02:10:24.736]  Like, me too.
[02:10:24.816 --> 02:10:25.356]  I get comfortable.
[02:10:25.376 --> 02:10:26.857]  It's like, I kind of know what's going on.
[02:10:26.877 --> 02:10:28.497]  I'm upset, but I'm like, well, that's how it is.
[02:10:28.817 --> 02:10:30.138]  No, that's not just how it is.
[02:10:30.798 --> 02:10:32.239]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:10:32.259 --> 02:10:32.799]  Stay with us.
[02:10:33.780 --> 02:10:36.021]  The great Kate Daly's taking over next segment.
[02:10:36.041 --> 02:10:36.861]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:10:36.881 --> 02:10:38.122]  We're talking to Steve and Melissa.
[02:10:38.882 --> 02:10:40.363]  I'm going to punch out of here for the next hour.
[02:10:40.403 --> 02:10:42.084]  Then Owen Shroyer comes back 3 p.m.
[02:10:42.144 --> 02:10:42.644]  Central.
[02:10:43.739 --> 02:10:54.752]  Hey Alex, I'm a flower delivery driver and I just wanted to touch on some observations I've noticed.
[02:10:55.693 --> 02:11:01.820]  I've been going to so many more funeral homes, hospitals, delivering get well soon.
[02:11:05.143 --> 02:11:15.416]  Just so much more than we would have ever taken to the... Oh yeah, the funeral business is booming, the mortuaries are booming, it's just boom, boom, boom and all the numbers, the insurance numbers show it.
[02:11:15.736 --> 02:11:16.938]  Biggest death in world history.
[02:11:16.958 --> 02:11:18.019]  They're just killing everybody.
[02:11:18.039 --> 02:11:18.600]  Isn't that liberal?
[02:11:19.645 --> 02:11:35.656]  Yeah man and also like you know a lot of my my friends are vaccinated they always got sniffles they're always you know and always seem a little bit sick I've seen a lot of people with like splints on and casts and a lot of girls with their hair falling out I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:11:35.896 --> 02:11:38.077]  Oh that's liberal though that's liberal I mean come on.
[02:11:38.998 --> 02:11:55.566]   Yeah it's it's uh You know, but, you know, even us, even the people that haven't been vaccinated, I think that they, I mean, we're still going to be exposed to the spike protein, so I think we, you know, and we should have an attitude of no man left behind, you know, all aware.
[02:11:55.586 --> 02:11:55.986]  No, I agree.
[02:11:56.006 --> 02:11:58.147]  We should be taking care of all the people that have been under this.
[02:11:58.747 --> 02:11:59.427]  They really hit us.
[02:11:59.467 --> 02:12:01.148]  They said they want to kill us, and now they're doing it.
[02:12:02.088 --> 02:12:08.847]   It's so weird because I've always lived in peaceful times in America, and I've never, you never had Uh, war come to us like this.
[02:12:08.967 --> 02:12:09.288]  That's right.
[02:12:09.308 --> 02:12:11.993]  They couldn't take America or the West on a frontal attack.
[02:12:12.474 --> 02:12:14.117]  They did it to the medical system and the UN.
[02:12:14.157 --> 02:12:14.478]  They did it.
[02:12:15.751 --> 02:12:16.171]  They did it.
[02:12:16.311 --> 02:12:16.791]  It's booming.
[02:12:16.811 --> 02:12:23.634]  You see the pharmacies and the hospitals batting on and all the people that are going to get, you know, help.
[02:12:23.654 --> 02:12:25.035]  They're just, they're draining them.
[02:12:25.135 --> 02:12:34.138]  But, you know, they're trying to build a false world and humanity's not, it's not going to be contained in that and we will prevail.
[02:12:34.939 --> 02:12:35.579]  I love you, brother.
[02:12:35.719 --> 02:12:36.920]  Perfect points.
[02:12:37.420 --> 02:12:39.581]  Let's just spend another minute here and we'll go to Melissa.
[02:12:40.721 --> 02:12:44.022]  I mean, how long have you been doing flower delivery and how much of an increase have you seen?
[02:12:44.062 --> 02:12:45.443]  Just dead reckoning.
[02:12:46.334 --> 02:12:53.139]  I've been doing it for, you know, a good bit recently, more than I used to full-time, just because of the work there.
[02:12:53.379 --> 02:13:03.266]  But I've been doing it for 15 years, and it's just, it's like, it's, we used to have, you know, one here and there going to a funeral, but now it's every day I'm going to all the funeral homes.
[02:13:03.766 --> 02:13:04.767]  I'm going to all the hospitals.
[02:13:04.787 --> 02:13:09.791]  So you've been doing delivery stuff for 15 years, there's now a boom in flowers and funeral homes, so you're doing it full-time.
[02:13:10.231 --> 02:13:11.131]  So just dead wrecking it.
[02:13:11.151 --> 02:13:11.492]  Is it 100% increase?
[02:13:11.512 --> 02:13:11.812]  500% increase?
[02:13:11.872 --> 02:13:12.092]  It's, it's...
[02:13:17.074 --> 02:13:18.114]  Oh, it's like 500.
[02:13:18.435 --> 02:13:20.635]  It's so astronomically more.
[02:13:21.556 --> 02:13:30.719]  Hospitals, funeral homes, get well soon, all those type things for flowers to people's homes that are homesick, all that stuff.
[02:13:30.759 --> 02:13:31.540]  It's got it.
[02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:33.941]  Well, all the numbers show that, brother, so you're not lying.
[02:13:33.961 --> 02:13:34.681]  I appreciate your call.
[02:13:34.701 --> 02:13:35.221]  God bless you.
[02:13:35.741 --> 02:13:36.842]  Melissa in Arizona.
[02:13:36.882 --> 02:13:37.342]  Go ahead.
[02:13:37.382 --> 02:13:39.663]  Last caller for KDally takes over.
[02:13:41.003 --> 02:13:42.464]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:13:42.484 --> 02:14:03.318]   I just wanted to follow up on you saying how we need to expose everyone so everyone knows what's going on and I'm not saying that every single person that wears Balenciaga clothes is doing so as part of a satanic death cult, but people who say that they are fashion influencers influencers and who quote say fashion does have meaning
[02:14:03.318 --> 02:14:09.998]   what you wear has as much meaning as what you say or do Are responsible and I don't know if the crew can pull up a
[02:14:09.998 --> 02:14:17.778]   picture from Michelle Obama Wearing a banana yellow wraparound dress in December 20th
[02:14:17.778 --> 02:14:23.698]   of 20. Oh, yeah, no Kamala Harris's stepdaughter Is a major model for Balenciaga
[02:14:24.458 --> 02:14:31.458]   Yeah, yeah, Michelle Obama has these $3,900 thigh-high skin tight Balenciaga glitter boots
[02:14:31.458 --> 02:14:37.498]   That she you know has said that she was embracing young designers champion retailers
[02:14:37.498 --> 02:14:43.338]   So I want to know you know what she what exactly is the meaning behind her wearing those boots
[02:14:43.394 --> 02:14:46.715]  Well, number one, it's a hideous dress, and number two, it's gross.
[02:14:47.176 --> 02:14:53.198]  And you know, whenever I get a chance to interview Kanye West, I'm going to ask him, he's done some criticism of Balenciaga now, but I'm going to ask him what he thinks of that.
[02:14:54.409 --> 02:15:01.047]  Oh yeah, how much money did she, you know, prostitute out for them, and where's her apologies, and why does she burn her boots?
[02:15:02.337 --> 02:15:02.758]  Good point.
[02:15:02.798 --> 02:15:07.401]  We're all supposed to kill each other because we're white and whites are bad, but she wants to push racism.
[02:15:07.421 --> 02:15:09.662]  But I mean, what about her wearing a slaver outfit?
[02:15:10.123 --> 02:15:11.043]  Great points, Melissa.
[02:15:11.063 --> 02:15:11.664]  God bless you.

[02:16:34.352 --> 02:16:35.833]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:16:35.873 --> 02:16:37.053]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[02:16:37.093 --> 02:16:38.174]  So glad to be with you today.
[02:16:38.194 --> 02:16:42.616]  I'm going to be commenting on all kinds of headlines, giving you, well, let me put it this way.
[02:16:43.036 --> 02:16:47.998]  I just had my 12 year anniversary on Monday of being on the radio.
[02:16:48.558 --> 02:16:48.858]  12 years.
[02:16:48.918 --> 02:16:52.580]  I never thought that that would be what I would end up doing.
[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:55.081]  And it just sort of fell into my lap.
[02:16:55.201 --> 02:17:01.363]  And then all of a sudden I was studying like a crazy person trying to figure out what in the world was going on with our country.
[02:17:01.443 --> 02:17:02.664]  And I know you felt the same way.
[02:17:03.775 --> 02:17:12.977]  And I think one thing that this last 12 years has given me, because I think, you know, when I entered into this, I think I was probably more of a rhino than anything.
[02:17:13.417 --> 02:17:18.478]  And when I entered into radio, I found out really, I didn't know much.
[02:17:18.538 --> 02:17:20.679]  I didn't understand things the way I should.
[02:17:20.959 --> 02:17:26.020]  And of course, growing up in California on the beach, didn't get much of an education as you could probably guess.
[02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:31.001]  And so I had to really plow in and find out what was happening, what was going on.
[02:17:31.041 --> 02:17:32.101]  I got on my knees a lot.
[02:17:32.701 --> 02:17:38.046]  And prayed for guidance to figure out what was going on in this world because I knew things weren't going right.
[02:17:38.306 --> 02:17:40.067]  And I knew things didn't sound right.
[02:17:40.688 --> 02:17:47.313]  And in my gut, that little feeling you get in your gut, you know things aren't what they seem to be, right?
[02:17:47.554 --> 02:17:49.635]  You know that there's more of a narrative going on.
[02:17:49.755 --> 02:17:52.358]  And when you can finally see that, you can't unsee it.
[02:17:53.018 --> 02:17:53.659]  You really can't.
[02:17:53.779 --> 02:17:55.020]  You can't unsee truth.
[02:17:57.119 --> 02:18:03.384]  I look at the last 12 years and I plowed into probably 30, 35,000 hours now of study.
[02:18:03.804 --> 02:18:05.065]  That is a lot of study.
[02:18:05.085 --> 02:18:09.949]  That is a lot of study into the deep dive behind our government.
[02:18:10.549 --> 02:18:14.172]  And it seems that well-laid plans have been obviously hatched.
[02:18:14.716 --> 02:18:18.042]  It seems that we've gone in one direction the last 120 years.
[02:18:18.202 --> 02:18:24.432]  No matter who's in office, no matter which side, we have it very controlled and of course nothing ever changes.
[02:18:24.593 --> 02:18:26.376]  You don't get liberty back, in other words.
[02:18:26.876 --> 02:18:33.047]   Liberty doesn't Doesn't come back to us, you know, when we had the House and the Senate and the presidency.
[02:18:33.488 --> 02:18:34.849]  We didn't get rid of Obamacare.
[02:18:34.889 --> 02:18:35.850]  We didn't build a wall.
[02:18:35.890 --> 02:18:38.432]  We didn't do anything that we said we were going to do.
[02:18:38.452 --> 02:18:42.656]  A lot of excuses to the minority, and that's just kind of how it works.
[02:18:42.736 --> 02:18:45.078]  Oh, those Democrats are making it so that we can't do it.
[02:18:45.278 --> 02:18:45.538]  Really?
[02:18:45.558 --> 02:18:46.679]  Because you are the majority.
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:54.086]  And so when the Democrats are in office, it seems that they plow ahead and try to ruin the country pretty aggressively.
[02:18:54.586 --> 02:18:59.228]  It seems when the right is in office, they stand there and do nothing, and then give you a bunch of excuses.
[02:18:59.908 --> 02:19:07.171]  I was invited to do C-SPAN on Thanksgiving morning, and I talked about that very thing, because I was asked, who was I going to vote for?
[02:19:07.191 --> 02:19:11.853]  And my answer was, none of them, because they're all bought and sold by the parties.
[02:19:11.913 --> 02:19:17.995]  And if they make it that far, and they're vetted, you know that they're going to do the bidding of the parties.
[02:19:18.375 --> 02:19:22.477]  And sometimes you can have an outlier in history, you can have somebody that changes their mind.
[02:19:23.129 --> 02:19:24.410]  That was the case in Hoover.
[02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:30.273]  That's why they named the depression after Hoover was because he didn't exactly go along with the plan.
[02:19:30.373 --> 02:19:33.854]  He didn't do what he was going to do, you know, supposed to do in office.
[02:19:33.874 --> 02:19:42.639]  They thought they had him and then yeah, he ventured off a little bit and so that's why he was a one-termer and that's why they got him out and they named the depression after him, right?
[02:19:42.659 --> 02:19:44.880]  A lot of people don't realize that in history.
[02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:56.432]   So looking at things now, I want to take what I've learned and really what I've learned is to have a Handy-dandy media government decoder ring.
[02:19:56.692 --> 02:19:57.633]  Yeah, it's invisible.
[02:19:57.673 --> 02:19:58.754]  I don't really have the ring on.
[02:19:59.274 --> 02:20:06.040]  But I know now, you know, at looking at these stories, I have certain questions and I want to share those questions with you today.
[02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:12.986]  Because there's some pretty intriguing things that come up when you look at the headlines and you must ask why.
[02:20:13.386 --> 02:20:14.047]  Why and how.
[02:20:14.347 --> 02:20:17.550]  Why and how and why these particular headlines.
[02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:19.752]  That's really what I'm getting at too.
[02:20:20.606 --> 02:20:40.900]  So far we know that we have an army of bots with fake accounts that seem to shore up all of social media to make you think that there is an army of people out there, and I mean a convincing army of people out there, that agree with the leftist lunatics of this nation, ruining this country, very aggressively destroying it.
[02:20:41.500 --> 02:20:48.684]  And so I just want to just make sure and just publicly realize that that army of bots is out there.
[02:20:48.724 --> 02:20:50.485]  These are fake accounts, fake people.
[02:20:51.006 --> 02:20:51.646]  But you know what?
[02:20:51.826 --> 02:20:53.967]  The leftist lunatics have to do it that way.
[02:20:54.287 --> 02:20:55.448]  Everything is deception.
[02:20:55.468 --> 02:20:58.250]  Do you remember Hillary in her green screen when she was running for president?
[02:20:58.270 --> 02:21:02.192]  Because nobody would really show up the way that they would tout it.
[02:21:02.572 --> 02:21:06.856]  So she never had the numbers really and truly that the media would report.
[02:21:07.156 --> 02:21:09.278]  And King Frodelot didn't have them either.
[02:21:09.358 --> 02:21:10.138]  And we all know that.
[02:21:10.218 --> 02:21:12.180]  He was never the most popular man in history.
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:14.062]  Yeah, never.
[02:21:14.342 --> 02:21:15.183]  That never happened.
[02:21:15.643 --> 02:21:16.804]  So of course there's fraud.
[02:21:16.844 --> 02:21:18.265]  And I mentioned that several times on C-SPAN.
[02:21:20.686 --> 02:21:21.306]  It's just funny.
[02:21:21.466 --> 02:21:24.468]  It's funny that people shy away from the word fraud.
[02:21:24.608 --> 02:21:26.189]  You should be saying it in every sentence.
[02:21:26.269 --> 02:21:29.691]  You should be saying it all over social media because it's so obvious.
[02:21:30.171 --> 02:21:30.792]  But you know what?
[02:21:31.092 --> 02:21:35.375]  The leftist lunatics are the party of green screens, lies, fakery, and deception.
[02:21:35.695 --> 02:21:36.095]  Always.
[02:21:36.295 --> 02:21:38.036]  So they have to invent support.
[02:21:38.296 --> 02:21:39.937]  And that's why they have their army of bots.
[02:21:40.278 --> 02:21:51.190]   And that's why you see the same comments over and over and over again made by supposed different people, word for word, In the comment sections over and over again.
[02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:54.032]  Also, let's start with Trump.
[02:21:54.112 --> 02:21:55.172]  Let's start with this headline.
[02:21:55.993 --> 02:21:57.274]  He has lunch with Kanye.
[02:21:57.514 --> 02:21:58.415]  I don't want to call him Yee.
[02:21:58.495 --> 02:21:59.075]  What a dumb name.
[02:21:59.255 --> 02:21:59.976]  Anyway, Kanye.
[02:22:00.056 --> 02:22:00.996]  I actually like Kanye.
[02:22:01.036 --> 02:22:02.417]  I actually think he's kind of cool.
[02:22:02.797 --> 02:22:04.558]  And I think he's saying what he wants to say.
[02:22:04.658 --> 02:22:11.283]  Pretty refreshing coming from Hollywood where you're made to side with all of these liberal fanatics, right?
[02:22:11.643 --> 02:22:14.085]  In order to have a career or ever earn an award.
[02:22:14.445 --> 02:22:19.554]   So the fact that he's coming out and talking about things that aren't talked about Really, I like that.
[02:22:19.914 --> 02:22:20.955]  So kudos to him.
[02:22:21.636 --> 02:22:38.631]  So you have lunch with Trump, and really what's happening from this is Romney, Pence, sellout, and so many politicians jumped on the bandwagon in a really opportunistic way to make sure that they demonize Trump over this lunch.
[02:22:39.291 --> 02:22:43.235]  Now when you have lunch with Trump, I doubt you're going to invite a few surprise friends.
[02:22:43.275 --> 02:22:44.416]  I don't think it works that way.
[02:22:44.935 --> 02:22:46.316]  So one of two things happened.
[02:22:46.576 --> 02:22:48.778]  Either number one, it was a deflection.
[02:22:48.938 --> 02:22:50.359]  Oh, I didn't know these people were coming.
[02:22:50.379 --> 02:22:53.181]  Okay, that's fair.
[02:22:53.201 --> 02:23:00.065]  Or you're trying to make it so that you are, you know, distancing yourself away from the guests that were there.
[02:23:00.085 --> 02:23:02.327]  Now, last time I checked, you're in America.
[02:23:02.387 --> 02:23:04.068]  You can have lunch with whoever you want.
[02:23:04.188 --> 02:23:11.333]  And just because the Department of Defense declares you a white supremacist with a name like Fuentes, not quite sure how that worked out.
[02:23:12.434 --> 02:23:12.554]  Hmm.
[02:23:13.300 --> 02:23:15.562]  Anyway, it doesn't mean you are.
[02:23:16.082 --> 02:23:17.964]  Because look what they did to January 6th.
[02:23:18.544 --> 02:23:21.486]  The people that went to the Capitol concerned about our country.
[02:23:22.287 --> 02:23:24.829]  Obviously, they're good Americans.
[02:23:24.949 --> 02:23:29.893]  So, the Department of Defense can name whatever they want to name or see whatever they want to see.
[02:23:29.953 --> 02:23:31.094]  It means zero.
[02:23:31.234 --> 02:23:31.975]  It means nothing.
[02:23:32.315 --> 02:23:34.877]  And you can have lunch with whoever you want to have lunch with.
[02:23:35.966 --> 02:23:38.128]  But I doubt that there was some surprise going on.
[02:23:38.588 --> 02:23:55.818]  So the other alternative theory would be that Kanye may have been threatened to do a setup lunch so that these people would have had an opportunity, like Romney, who gets his claws into this political hack, gets his claws into Trump as often as he can.
[02:23:55.878 --> 02:23:57.219]  He's obsessed with Trump.
[02:23:57.459 --> 02:23:59.260]  He has this obsession that won't quit.
[02:23:59.541 --> 02:24:01.902]  This is why my state of Utah hates him.
[02:24:02.612 --> 02:24:03.733]  And I can't stand him.
[02:24:03.773 --> 02:24:04.993]  Go look at his comment section.
[02:24:05.273 --> 02:24:07.094]  Go look at his comment section whenever he posts.
[02:24:07.374 --> 02:24:08.135]  Oh my gosh.
[02:24:08.935 --> 02:24:12.297]  The hate comes out 95% of the time.
[02:24:12.857 --> 02:24:14.698]  You'll see hateful comments about Romney.
[02:24:14.958 --> 02:24:20.240]  But Romney tries to do that in the press any opportunity he can because he doesn't get the press.
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:25.723]  I mean, he gets a lot of press and he gets a lot of good press in his favor because of the demonization of Trump.
[02:24:26.043 --> 02:24:28.104]  So this story was really handed to them.
[02:24:28.684 --> 02:24:31.727]  And handed to them in a really kind of strange way, don't you think?
[02:24:32.187 --> 02:24:34.589]  Making something out of something out of nothing?
[02:24:34.609 --> 02:24:35.410]  Hmm.
[02:24:36.090 --> 02:24:49.541]  So if Kanye was threatened to do this, because I think Kanye's probably pretty threatened living in a very, uh, a world that is run by the leftist lunatics, that, uh, I guess I could see that happening, right?
[02:24:49.761 --> 02:24:51.563]  To set up Trump a little bit, who knows?
[02:24:51.903 --> 02:24:58.487]   And if that didn't happen, I apologize to Kanye, if that didn't happen, Then of course, how did they know what was said in the meeting?
[02:24:58.547 --> 02:25:00.528]  How did they know what happened in the meeting?
[02:25:00.808 --> 02:25:02.609]  And how did they know the meeting took place?
[02:25:02.830 --> 02:25:03.070]  Right?
[02:25:03.150 --> 02:25:05.712]  It's a little tiny lunch and then off to do other things.
[02:25:05.832 --> 02:25:06.692]  Why does it matter?
[02:25:07.172 --> 02:25:07.893]  Why does it matter?
[02:25:08.373 --> 02:25:10.815]  Romney and Pence even calling it disgusting.
[02:25:11.555 --> 02:25:13.377]  They could have been talking about tulips.
[02:25:13.717 --> 02:25:14.257]  Who knows?
[02:25:14.918 --> 02:25:15.858]  But we're in America.
[02:25:16.098 --> 02:25:16.979]  It still doesn't matter.
[02:25:17.916 --> 02:25:24.040]  And when McCain used to meet with the terrorists or Biden meets with China, that's never in the press, is it?
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:24.660]  No.
[02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:32.024]  It's kind of like raids on my pillow guy, Mike Lindell, but not on anybody actually doing any crime.
[02:25:32.284 --> 02:25:33.125]  It's kind of like that.
[02:25:33.325 --> 02:25:36.927]  It's kind of like that hypocrisy and that demonization factor.
[02:25:37.067 --> 02:25:39.529]  And I think America is getting really tired of it, actually.
[02:25:39.549 --> 02:25:42.590]  I think they've spun that card too often.
[02:25:42.971 --> 02:25:55.399]   And I think people are finally waking up to the fact that the media is there as a Sounding board for the Department of Defense, the Pentagon, and also our government, trying to spin every single story into what they want to spin.
[02:25:55.660 --> 02:25:57.101]  This is a pretty obvious thing, right?
[02:25:57.741 --> 02:26:02.885]  When I come back, too, I want to talk a little bit about this clothing line, why it's in the press.
[02:26:03.485 --> 02:26:13.352]  And you know, it is kind of strange that they're pointing out Kim Kardashian wearing the line, and then also Kanye is in the headlines for the lunch with Trump.
[02:26:14.373 --> 02:26:16.014]  Is that weird kind of timing to you?
[02:26:16.866 --> 02:26:17.366]  I think it is.
[02:26:17.386 --> 02:26:18.327]  I think it's kind of strange.
[02:26:18.367 --> 02:26:19.487]  Something to think about anyway.
[02:26:19.547 --> 02:26:21.408]  Toss around in the brain cells for a moment.
[02:26:21.969 --> 02:26:24.370]  But I'm going to come right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.831]  So stay with me.
[02:26:25.851 --> 02:26:29.532]  I'm back here with you on the Alex Jones Show today.
[02:26:29.713 --> 02:26:31.333]  So happy to be a part of your day.
[02:26:31.594 --> 02:26:34.315]  And I'm Kate Dally from the katedallyradio.com.
[02:26:34.375 --> 02:26:36.256]  katedallyradio.com, your guest host.
[02:26:37.046 --> 02:26:39.887]  Okay, let's talk about the obvious, shall we?
[02:26:40.027 --> 02:26:45.630]  There's always very acute reasons for certain headlines to pop up.
[02:26:46.110 --> 02:26:49.292]  And that's what I want to talk about when it comes to Balenciaga, okay?
[02:26:50.352 --> 02:26:57.976]  Balenciaga, very weird because probably a week ago, most people have never really talked about it, wasn't in the news, of course.
[02:26:58.875 --> 02:27:00.676]  And it wasn't really on our lips.
[02:27:00.716 --> 02:27:05.477]  Something like Dolce & Gabbana may be a little bit more recognizable, right?
[02:27:06.017 --> 02:27:06.877]  Than this outfit.
[02:27:07.398 --> 02:27:07.878]  So why?
[02:27:08.598 --> 02:27:09.598]  So why did this happen?
[02:27:10.098 --> 02:27:16.760]  How did it get through so many hands who honestly and truly look at what they're putting out in a catalog?
[02:27:17.161 --> 02:27:17.401]  Why?
[02:27:17.841 --> 02:27:19.261]  Why is this headline in the news?
[02:27:19.621 --> 02:27:20.321]  Very interesting.
[02:27:21.102 --> 02:27:25.363]  There's a really demonic chick named Lata Volcava.
[02:27:27.995 --> 02:27:28.796]  She's a special one.
[02:27:29.636 --> 02:27:33.840]  She is in a relationship with an accused pedophile.
[02:27:34.741 --> 02:27:39.125]  She may or may not be one of the reasons why we're seeing the ads that we are.
[02:27:39.345 --> 02:27:43.528]  She seems to have a little fetish with teddy bears and creepy art.
[02:27:44.029 --> 02:27:48.573]  She really rivals Podesta in her creep art with children.
[02:27:48.793 --> 02:27:53.917]  Children being harmed, children in strange places, children being abused.
[02:27:55.976 --> 02:28:01.963]  And what's really strange is she's been the main stylist for Balenciaga since 2014.
[02:28:02.784 --> 02:28:13.457]  If you've seen her, you might have seen her iconic photo where she is posed in red, looking really demonic with red blood covered dolls in her hands.
[02:28:13.717 --> 02:28:14.999]  She's, yeah.
[02:28:15.683 --> 02:28:20.544]  Anyway, this little treat is basically the main stylist, right?
[02:28:20.844 --> 02:28:22.685]  Well, they're throwing... Yeah, see?
[02:28:23.045 --> 02:28:23.245]  See?
[02:28:23.285 --> 02:28:24.045]  Demonic, right?
[02:28:24.385 --> 02:28:25.125]  Really strange.
[02:28:25.225 --> 02:28:27.486]  And most of the pictures look like this of her.
[02:28:27.986 --> 02:28:28.586]  She's strange.
[02:28:28.626 --> 02:28:29.546]  Her name is Lara.
[02:28:30.167 --> 02:28:36.068]  So, you have this stylist throwing these people under the bus, the photographers, like Gabriel Guillemberti.
[02:28:36.853 --> 02:28:39.975]  And of course, the photographers don't have much to do with it.
[02:28:40.015 --> 02:28:45.679]  They don't have a backbone or courage or any moral aptitude to call it out and say, why am I taking a photo of this?
[02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:52.544]  But on the other hand, they're not in charge of styling a teddy bear in S&M, right?
[02:28:53.065 --> 02:28:53.285]  Right.
[02:28:53.305 --> 02:28:56.767]  Because I know the first thing when I look at a teddy bear, I think S&M, don't you?
[02:28:58.428 --> 02:29:05.013]  Anyway, so these whack jobs, these hacks put this stuff together, these evil little people.
[02:29:05.843 --> 02:29:09.384]  And it goes through a lot of hands before it ever hits the catalog.
[02:29:09.464 --> 02:29:11.504]  So you know it was noticed, right?
[02:29:11.684 --> 02:29:12.745]  You know it was noticed.
[02:29:14.205 --> 02:29:15.265]  So that's the obvious.
[02:29:16.205 --> 02:29:18.486]  It's an off-brand that people don't really recognize.
[02:29:19.446 --> 02:29:24.747]  The Kardashians, pretty much I think it paid for Kourtney Kardashian's wedding, Balenciaga.
[02:29:24.927 --> 02:29:28.748]  Anyway, but this chick has worked for Vogue, Adidas.
[02:29:29.841 --> 02:29:31.962]  Balenciaga, Chanel, right?
[02:29:32.302 --> 02:29:35.662]  All of these Marc Jacobs constantly comments on her Instagram.
[02:29:36.563 --> 02:29:38.043]  She's right up there with Podesta.
[02:29:38.123 --> 02:29:40.224]  Disturbing image after disturbing image.
[02:29:40.564 --> 02:29:42.864]  Kid mutilation, guts hanging out.
[02:29:42.924 --> 02:29:46.525]  You know, all the things you think of when you think of a fun kid childhood, right?
[02:29:47.565 --> 02:29:52.446]  So this strange sicko is their main stylist.
[02:29:52.486 --> 02:29:55.107]  Keep that in mind because here's the deal, right?
[02:29:56.141 --> 02:30:08.466]  The Independent put out a piece that said this, and I'm going to read this word for word because I thought this was excruciating to see this in The Independent, but then I guess Independent is full of fake journalism.
[02:30:09.067 --> 02:30:09.787]  So here we go.
[02:30:09.867 --> 02:30:12.608]  It was kind of, you know, why isn't this going to be a big deal?
[02:30:12.828 --> 02:30:14.549]  But let me let me let me give you their comment.
[02:30:14.589 --> 02:30:19.271]  This was the last comment of the article they wrote about it because really, folks, nothing to see here.
[02:30:19.511 --> 02:30:20.192]  Don't look here.
[02:30:20.212 --> 02:30:20.912]  Right.
[02:30:21.610 --> 02:30:26.431]  So I quote, perhaps the reason why fashion keeps getting it wrong is because it wants to.
[02:30:27.251 --> 02:30:27.571]  Really?
[02:30:28.191 --> 02:30:35.092]  In today's social media obsessed landscape, scandals are a way of maintaining cultural relevance.
[02:30:35.592 --> 02:30:43.614]  It starts with a conversation, whether it's a positive or negative, one doesn't matter much because for better or for worse, people are talking about you.
[02:30:43.974 --> 02:30:50.275]  And in the case of Balenciaga, only time will tell whether this was a business ending move.
[02:30:51.181 --> 02:30:54.302]  Or the sign of a very successful marketing campaign.
[02:30:54.622 --> 02:30:56.202]  Do you see how they're propping this up?
[02:30:57.522 --> 02:30:58.803]  They wanted you to see this.
[02:30:59.623 --> 02:31:00.423]  They wanted you to.
[02:31:00.463 --> 02:31:01.523]  There was no mistake.
[02:31:02.323 --> 02:31:05.364]  And I actually think that many people would have never even noticed it.
[02:31:05.844 --> 02:31:06.564]  They got caught.
[02:31:07.145 --> 02:31:09.545]  See, because normalizing this is part of their game.
[02:31:10.225 --> 02:31:16.507]  Scandal after scandal after scandal will numb humanity to child pedo.
[02:31:16.747 --> 02:31:18.307]  That's really what they're after.
[02:31:19.159 --> 02:31:36.424]  And I found the timing to be really strange when California came out and basically said, basically put it out there that they were going to turn out all of these, you know, accused pedophiles, rapists, things like that.
[02:31:36.504 --> 02:31:40.886]  They were going to put them back in society because, you know, we need them, right?
[02:31:41.886 --> 02:31:45.067]  And of course, they call themselves minor attracted persons.
[02:31:45.727 --> 02:31:47.128]  Isn't it interesting the timing?
[02:31:47.328 --> 02:31:48.128]  What are the odds?
[02:31:49.434 --> 02:31:50.035]  What are the odds?
[02:31:50.976 --> 02:32:00.611]  You get this type of stuff from California, which I'm from California, so I can make fun of California and you have to about every five minutes because they're a joke, right?
[02:32:00.651 --> 02:32:02.053]  They become the biggest joke.
[02:32:02.987 --> 02:32:06.870]  The stuff that they turn out, it's very Canadian actually.
[02:32:07.130 --> 02:32:13.074]  You know how Canada is trying to force, or they would like to force medication on the unvaccinated.
[02:32:13.494 --> 02:32:14.675]  That kind of stuff, right?
[02:32:15.035 --> 02:32:16.756]  Very Justin Trudeau of them.
[02:32:17.497 --> 02:32:19.058]  But following in those same footsteps.
[02:32:19.178 --> 02:32:28.264]  So it doesn't even surprise me that you would get a headline talking about how, hey, I know it's just no big deal here, but we're going to turn out a bunch of sexual deviants.
[02:32:28.624 --> 02:32:30.866]  I know, they don't really want to be in prison anymore.
[02:32:31.266 --> 02:32:32.507]  So hey, why not?
[02:32:34.187 --> 02:32:35.228]  They're normalizing it.
[02:32:35.388 --> 02:32:36.948]  They wanted you to see that headline.
[02:32:37.428 --> 02:32:37.828]  They did.
[02:32:38.809 --> 02:32:47.811]  And, of course, the media now is going to spin it as, look, these celebrities, these leftist loon bags, they're going to get upset about a lot of things, right?
[02:32:47.851 --> 02:32:51.112]  You don't accept their transgender child.
[02:32:51.292 --> 02:32:54.693]  You don't like drag queen shows sponsored by Tractor Supply.
[02:32:54.854 --> 02:32:56.354]  What the heck, Tractor Supply?
[02:32:56.374 --> 02:32:57.514]  Gross.
[02:32:58.014 --> 02:32:59.555]  Anyway, you don't like all that.
[02:33:00.453 --> 02:33:01.074]  A child?
[02:33:01.674 --> 02:33:02.395]  Child harm?
[02:33:02.475 --> 02:33:03.376]  Child abuse?
[02:33:03.676 --> 02:33:04.037]  Evil?
[02:33:04.417 --> 02:33:05.338]  Child abuse?
[02:33:06.079 --> 02:33:06.720]  Child death?
[02:33:07.300 --> 02:33:08.121]  Child S&M?
[02:33:08.481 --> 02:33:09.142]  No big deal.
[02:33:09.242 --> 02:33:10.083]  Nothing to see here.
[02:33:10.303 --> 02:33:11.745]  This is basically for our career.
[02:33:12.265 --> 02:33:16.470]  So, Kimmy Kardashian comes out and says, you know, I'm going to re-evaluate.
[02:33:16.690 --> 02:33:18.912]  I'm just going to simply re-evaluate.
[02:33:19.773 --> 02:33:20.534]  Re-evaluate.
[02:33:21.744 --> 02:33:22.625]  How about condemn?
[02:33:23.245 --> 02:33:24.186]  How about be angry?
[02:33:24.306 --> 02:33:25.387]  How about be pissed off?
[02:33:25.807 --> 02:33:26.307]  No, no, no.
[02:33:26.588 --> 02:33:27.368]  No, of course not.
[02:33:27.768 --> 02:33:28.709]  Just reevaluate.
[02:33:28.729 --> 02:33:30.050]  I'm just going to look again.
[02:33:30.070 --> 02:33:37.435]  I'm just going to see whether it's harming my career or not, you know, because I didn't get famous for anything but a sex tape and because I look the way I do.
[02:33:37.536 --> 02:33:37.916]  Thank you.
[02:33:38.396 --> 02:33:39.337]  So that's Kimmy.
[02:33:40.091 --> 02:33:46.693]  So I do find it a little weird that Kimmy Kardashian and Kanye are both in the news at the same time for different reasons.
[02:33:47.033 --> 02:33:47.353]  I don't know.
[02:33:47.373 --> 02:33:48.574]  There's something wrong there.
[02:33:48.614 --> 02:33:50.094]  There's something wrong with those headlines.
[02:33:50.634 --> 02:33:50.894]  Right?
[02:33:51.034 --> 02:33:51.795]  There has to be.
[02:33:51.815 --> 02:33:54.656]  And the timing of this, you're going to see more of this.
[02:33:54.756 --> 02:33:59.097]  And the media is going to turn it into, they likened it to blackface.
[02:33:59.377 --> 02:34:02.778]  Oh, remember that time in 2018 where we went blackface?
[02:34:02.878 --> 02:34:03.318]  Oopsies.
[02:34:03.678 --> 02:34:04.999]  And it gave us a ton of press.
[02:34:05.942 --> 02:34:08.808]  And, um, oh yeah, we don't, we don't stand behind that.
[02:34:08.868 --> 02:34:09.970]  We don't really like that.
[02:34:10.031 --> 02:34:12.215]  And oops, it just kind of got through.
[02:34:12.235 --> 02:34:15.542]  They do it for, they do it for press.
[02:34:16.189 --> 02:34:21.113]  They do it for a scandal because they think the scandal is going to just give them more visibility.
[02:34:21.674 --> 02:34:31.983]  The problem with that is, is now they're going to turn it into child pedo is normal and pedophiles are normal and it's okay to be minor attracted.
[02:34:32.183 --> 02:34:35.926]  Have you ever heard such an evil term as minor attracted?
[02:34:36.727 --> 02:34:36.967]  Hello?
[02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:45.884]  We have something very wrong, and I do find it really weird that California puts out that they've decided to turn all these people out on the streets, right?
[02:34:46.264 --> 02:34:48.345]  At the same time, they're trying to normalize this.
[02:34:48.885 --> 02:34:51.407]  That article in The Independent was pathetic.
[02:34:51.827 --> 02:34:52.767]  It was pathetic.
[02:34:52.827 --> 02:34:54.488]  It didn't really call anything out.
[02:34:54.888 --> 02:34:59.071]  It just went, oops, wonder if this is a successful marketing move, wink wink.
[02:34:59.771 --> 02:35:01.432]  Isn't that gross and disgusting?
[02:35:01.732 --> 02:35:02.492]  Yeah, I think it is.
[02:35:02.933 --> 02:35:05.554]  When I come back, I want to talk about FTX.
[02:35:05.594 --> 02:35:06.794]  I want to talk about Greta.
[02:35:08.693 --> 02:35:09.334]  I'll be right back.
[02:35:09.834 --> 02:35:10.574]  Welcome back.
[02:35:10.734 --> 02:35:11.975]  Alex Jones Show here.
[02:35:12.035 --> 02:35:13.636]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host.
[02:35:13.656 --> 02:35:14.137]  How are you?
[02:35:14.977 --> 02:35:15.397]  All right.
[02:35:15.558 --> 02:35:22.942]  I've got a lot to talk about in this next segment because after 12 years on the radio, I hit that anniversary on Monday.
[02:35:22.962 --> 02:35:23.723]  I still can't believe it.
[02:35:24.283 --> 02:35:25.284]  It flew by, truly.
[02:35:25.304 --> 02:35:26.745]  It's a lot of work, but it flew by.
[02:35:27.429 --> 02:35:38.472]  Look, one of the things that's always amazed me is the climate change narrative, is the ridiculousness, the well-laid plans of climate change.
[02:35:38.972 --> 02:35:43.574]  Do you guys realize they started this actually back in the late 1800s?
[02:35:44.014 --> 02:35:47.355]  They tried to develop the synthetic fertilizer, right?
[02:35:47.415 --> 02:35:53.056]  Because up to that point, we used to use normal fertilizers, not fertilizers, but natural things.
[02:35:53.316 --> 02:35:55.097]  We used certain plants and bushes.
[02:35:55.837 --> 02:35:57.418]  All kinds of different natural ways.
[02:35:57.778 --> 02:36:03.061]  But they had to come up with a way to screw with our food supply basically, and they had to come up with a way to screw you over.
[02:36:03.481 --> 02:36:15.427]  So what they did was they started saying that we were going to have major depopulation and major... Well, it's really when they started depopulation, but they told us that we wouldn't be able to provide enough food.
[02:36:15.927 --> 02:36:18.688]  We wouldn't be able to feed all of those people.
[02:36:18.788 --> 02:36:21.070]  Now granted, this was in the late 1800s, right?
[02:36:21.750 --> 02:36:23.651]  Not very many people around.
[02:36:24.285 --> 02:36:25.940]  But not like it is now.
[02:36:26.670 --> 02:36:37.393]  But still, they were touting this because they had to have some sort of reason, some sort of scapegoat to get you to believe that we were all about to die because we couldn't produce enough food.
[02:36:37.673 --> 02:36:50.176]  Now at the time, you had probably 90 to 95%, you had people growing their own food, either in their gardens or you had farmers owning their own lands and they weren't controlled and co-opted by government.
[02:36:50.696 --> 02:37:00.776]   We went into synthetic fertilizer and the same synthetic fertilizer that gave us DDT was DDT poisoning. It was actually developed in the late
[02:37:00.776 --> 02:37:06.415]   1800s. A lot of people don't know that. And they said they sat on it and then of course they
[02:37:06.415 --> 02:37:11.226]   brought it out in DDT in the 1940s, which I think is a lie. I think they actually
[02:37:11.226 --> 02:37:13.765]  started using it earlier on. Okay?
[02:37:13.765 --> 02:37:18.765]   So you have these toxic chemicals. Well, that's the thing that's causing some of the problems.
[02:37:18.755 --> 02:37:27.918]  But with climate change, it was a total joke because 60 years ago, they started saying at the end of every decade, you would turn into basically a popsicle.
[02:37:28.118 --> 02:37:30.479]  That was Leonard Nimoy back in the late 70s.
[02:37:30.879 --> 02:37:37.822]  He told everybody we would have death and destruction due to a heavy winter in 1977 in Chicago and New York.
[02:37:37.882 --> 02:37:40.983]  Because of the heavy winter, people might have to move.
[02:37:41.858 --> 02:37:42.898]  Oh boy, that's big.
[02:37:43.419 --> 02:37:45.519]  And also they could get very cold.
[02:37:46.100 --> 02:37:46.800]  It's called weather.
[02:37:47.380 --> 02:37:48.060]  It's called winter.
[02:37:48.781 --> 02:37:48.981]  I know.
[02:37:49.481 --> 02:37:55.103]  Anyway, so we had these storms, but they were using it as a catalyst to prove climate change.
[02:37:55.743 --> 02:38:12.106]   So at the end of every decade, not the middle, Not two-thirds of the way in, not a fourth of the way in, not at the beginning of the decade, but always at the end of the decade, you were told you were either going to freeze to death, or you were going to become a fried egg on the sidewalk, and we were all going to burn together, okay?
[02:38:12.866 --> 02:38:16.268]  Now, at the end of every decade, that didn't happen, so they kept changing the name.
[02:38:17.148 --> 02:38:28.054]  So, they meet, the G20 gets together and they meet, and they have a convention, really weird convention with weird statues, all kinds of things, right?
[02:38:28.712 --> 02:38:36.095]  And Greta, our little braided Greta, our little braided finger scolding Greta, you ruined my childhood!
[02:38:36.115 --> 02:38:37.395]  How dare you!
[02:38:37.495 --> 02:38:38.255]  How dare you!
[02:38:38.455 --> 02:38:38.776]  Okay?
[02:38:39.116 --> 02:38:42.897]  They pull her out of the closet, they put, you know, for all these years, right?
[02:38:42.957 --> 02:38:44.037]  For the last, like, what?
[02:38:44.097 --> 02:38:48.239]  We've had to have doses of her for the last seven to eight years of her ridiculousness.
[02:38:48.559 --> 02:38:49.920]  You've ruined my childhood!
[02:38:50.460 --> 02:38:58.611]   And they, all of a sudden, she does a no-show with And she actually calls it a scam.
[02:38:58.651 --> 02:39:01.593]  Now, she doesn't call climate change a scam, the scam that it is.
[02:39:02.073 --> 02:39:03.974]  And by the way, we do have climate change.
[02:39:04.114 --> 02:39:13.138]  It's just that you can't impact it, just like you can't impact winter coming, and you can't impact summer coming, and you can't impact when the sun rises.
[02:39:14.159 --> 02:39:19.962]  But this is a great way to tax, penalize you, and change our entire economy, like in Alex's book, right?
[02:39:20.365 --> 02:39:25.165]   clearly defines the great reset due to this new green economy.
[02:39:25.165 --> 02:39:30.865]   This is the transformation that we've been in for 50 years to transform capitalism into
[02:39:30.865 --> 02:39:35.566]   the green economy where the only companies that get money, the only way you can grow,
[02:39:35.566 --> 02:39:41.685]   the only thing you can do is to go with their green policies that are outrageous and ridiculous
[02:39:41.685 --> 02:39:46.365]   to finally, and sick, to finally get, you know, to grow as a business or do what you're
[02:39:46.365 --> 02:39:47.204]  going to do.
[02:39:47.411 --> 02:39:52.614]  You'll be rewarded while other businesses will be demolished, you know, like coal.
[02:39:53.255 --> 02:39:56.717]  So here we have this group meeting and this group meets.
[02:39:56.937 --> 02:39:57.438]  Greta's out.
[02:39:57.718 --> 02:39:58.598]  She's 19 now.
[02:39:58.778 --> 02:40:00.580]  The braids look a little silly, but whatever.
[02:40:01.060 --> 02:40:12.575]   The Sophie, the sexy Sophia now is in because they thought, you know, of course, Greta Saying that these people are greenwashing and scamming and she's really not talking about climate change.
[02:40:12.815 --> 02:40:17.979]  She's talking about just the people involved and how they're stealing, you know, the money and so forth.
[02:40:19.020 --> 02:40:20.822]  But they can't have that.
[02:40:21.122 --> 02:40:23.084]  They can't have little Greta and her little finger.
[02:40:23.104 --> 02:40:24.525]  They can't have her out there.
[02:40:24.585 --> 02:40:26.867]  She's going to say the people are greenwashing and scamming.
[02:40:27.067 --> 02:40:27.367]  Okay.
[02:40:27.767 --> 02:40:34.433]  Now she's calling out the scamming for different reasons than you and I would pointing to some of the people and not the whole scam.
[02:40:35.194 --> 02:40:41.319]  But they put in Sexy Sophia, and now Sexy Sophia, the millennial, is going to sell it to you.
[02:40:41.439 --> 02:40:47.083]  She's going to sell it to you in heels, and she's going to look good, and she's going to sell you a bunch of crap and a bunch of lies.
[02:40:47.464 --> 02:40:52.688]  But she's going to make it through to a lot of poor millennials who like to be brainwashed and don't want to think.
[02:40:52.888 --> 02:40:56.911]  So our poor youth, they have to undergo Sexy Sophia.
[02:40:57.411 --> 02:41:00.654]  Do you guys remember when they named the robot Sophia?
[02:41:00.674 --> 02:41:02.295]  Hmm.
[02:41:02.715 --> 02:41:03.536]  Kind of strange, right?
[02:41:03.596 --> 02:41:04.777]  Remember the robot Sophia?
[02:41:06.087 --> 02:41:08.788]  The one that told us that everyone's gonna die, that one?
[02:41:09.248 --> 02:41:12.870]  Yeah, I remember reporting on that a year ago, two years ago.
[02:41:13.410 --> 02:41:14.311]  Sexy Sophia.
[02:41:14.851 --> 02:41:18.312]  So, now we have Sexy Sophia, the climate change activist.
[02:41:19.533 --> 02:41:23.675]  But the G20 signed a declaration for the international vaccine passport.
[02:41:24.315 --> 02:41:32.323]   The one thing that I want to keep in mind too, because this is about control and nothing else, This is a signed declaration, okay?
[02:41:32.823 --> 02:41:34.664]  Yes, it means this is what we want.
[02:41:34.924 --> 02:41:37.826]  Yes, it means we're going to try to do this.
[02:41:38.266 --> 02:41:41.448]  But don't think for a second you can't fight back on this, okay?
[02:41:41.788 --> 02:41:42.669]  King fraud a lot.
[02:41:42.729 --> 02:41:46.571]  They rolled him out from eating ice cream and he attempted a climb at the podium.
[02:41:46.791 --> 02:41:49.293]  That's across, you know, the set across from the White House.
[02:41:49.313 --> 02:41:50.494]  He's never really in the White House.
[02:41:51.494 --> 02:41:57.638]  But he assured all of us that we would never have a vaccine passport here, just for maybe international travel.
[02:41:58.530 --> 02:41:58.730]  Hmm.
[02:41:59.071 --> 02:42:01.353]  For a pandemic that actually hasn't happened.
[02:42:02.073 --> 02:42:02.273]  Hmm.
[02:42:02.914 --> 02:42:11.162]  So now we're in a spot where we're kind of fearing because the G20 signs this, why wouldn't they sign it?
[02:42:11.322 --> 02:42:13.844]  They're all Klaus Schwab hacks.
[02:42:13.924 --> 02:42:15.025]  Why wouldn't they sign it?
[02:42:15.405 --> 02:42:18.088]  They're all part of the young globalist leaders, right?
[02:42:18.888 --> 02:42:24.872]  This little group of Klausies, they of course would sign this because what are they doing?
[02:42:24.932 --> 02:42:27.573]  They're telling you what they want, what they intend to have.
[02:42:28.034 --> 02:42:29.655]  Still doesn't mean it's going to happen.
[02:42:31.354 --> 02:42:36.519]  I don't trust Biden for a second or his fraudulent little group of marauders.
[02:42:36.859 --> 02:42:38.541]  I don't trust them for a second.
[02:42:38.861 --> 02:42:56.238]  But I also know that the American people are going to fight against this just like they're starting to see through all the booster shots and all of the shots as we have somebody, some celebrity somewhere, dying suddenly every day at a young age, just like our newest one today of the young country star.
[02:42:57.578 --> 02:42:59.299]  You know, within 24 hours of his wedding.
[02:42:59.359 --> 02:43:00.499]  This is happening more and more.
[02:43:00.679 --> 02:43:01.739]  It can't be ignored.
[02:43:02.280 --> 02:43:15.623]  I don't know how many brain cells people have to lose before they realize that the only thing they ever changed was the fact that they got these booster shots, these mysterious shots where they don't even know what the ingredients are, and all of a sudden people are dropping like flies.
[02:43:16.464 --> 02:43:20.525]  The press is still going to tell you that this was from COVID.
[02:43:20.905 --> 02:43:21.685]  This is from COVID.
[02:43:21.705 --> 02:43:24.786]  They're still trying to run on that fraudulent little lie.
[02:43:25.686 --> 02:43:27.347]  Not little, big lie, okay?
[02:43:28.107 --> 02:43:33.570]  Same folks trying to sell you that you were in a pandemic, even though you didn't see a pandemic in front of your own eyes.
[02:43:34.610 --> 02:43:37.172]  People weren't dropping dead in 2020, right?
[02:43:37.712 --> 02:43:39.533]  We just had the normal amount of deaths.
[02:43:40.313 --> 02:43:42.374]  There was never any cemetery added on to.
[02:43:43.034 --> 02:43:45.195]  We didn't spend more money on death.
[02:43:45.235 --> 02:43:46.176]  We actually spent less.
[02:43:46.986 --> 02:43:52.633]  A year before, we spent $16.2 billion, and in 2020, we spent $16.1 billion.
[02:43:52.713 --> 02:43:54.596]  We spent less money in 2020.
[02:43:54.776 --> 02:43:57.159]  It has nothing to do with Blovid.
[02:43:57.619 --> 02:43:59.041]  You can say Blovid's the cause.
[02:43:59.061 --> 02:44:01.044]  It has nothing to do with that.
[02:44:01.144 --> 02:44:03.487]  All that is is 98 symptoms of your flu.
[02:44:03.827 --> 02:44:04.788]  Really, it's FluVid.
[02:44:05.109 --> 02:44:05.349]  Okay?
[02:44:06.187 --> 02:44:11.511]  So what they're doing now is they're trying to sell you on the fact that this is COVID and it's the shots.
[02:44:11.591 --> 02:44:16.275]  It's the only thing that's changed is people running in to get their boosters so stupidly.
[02:44:16.295 --> 02:44:16.996]  Okay?
[02:44:18.217 --> 02:44:21.519]  I mean, this is, it's sick, it's evil.
[02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:27.764]  And in the news, we're going to constantly pretend like sudden death at the age of 37 is something so normal.
[02:44:27.824 --> 02:44:29.186]  This is so normal.
[02:44:29.506 --> 02:44:30.146]  Oh my gosh.
[02:44:30.226 --> 02:44:30.447]  Yes.
[02:44:30.507 --> 02:44:31.607]  They just died.
[02:44:31.627 --> 02:44:33.069]  I don't think so.
[02:44:33.369 --> 02:44:34.630]  And I know you don't think so.
[02:44:35.356 --> 02:44:47.065]  And I know that you're stunned by the lack of media attention to the all of a sudden daily, daily deaths, all the athletes dying that have died according to this.
[02:44:47.606 --> 02:44:48.687]  I know you're stunned too.
[02:44:48.947 --> 02:44:49.807]  I'll be right back.
[02:44:50.208 --> 02:44:54.956]   I'm Kate Delly, your guest host for the Alex Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:55.017 --> 02:44:56.879]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host for the hour.
[02:44:56.899 --> 02:44:58.381]  So glad you're joining me.
[02:44:58.701 --> 02:45:04.648]  I told you that the 12 years on the radio for me have earned me the decoder BS ring.
[02:45:06.470 --> 02:45:11.276]  Every time I look at a headline, I just see it so differently than I probably would have 12 years ago.
[02:45:12.048 --> 02:45:23.195]  And you know, I'm probably evidence that anyone from any, maybe any sort of education in politics can finally start to realize what's really happening.
[02:45:23.575 --> 02:45:24.655]  Everybody can be awake.
[02:45:24.876 --> 02:45:28.458]  Everybody can can go on that path and learn if they're willing to.
[02:45:28.918 --> 02:45:30.539]  There's so much information out there.
[02:45:30.839 --> 02:45:39.084]  And of course, fake information, you know, of course, with all of those that want to control it, didn't start really happening until Trump came on the scene.
[02:45:39.609 --> 02:45:44.368]   and started saying really the things that I had hoped presidents before him
[02:45:44.368 --> 02:45:47.968]   would have said when they called out mainstream media BS and when they did
[02:45:47.968 --> 02:45:48.849]  those types of things.
[02:45:48.849 --> 02:45:50.089]  It was good.
[02:45:50.089 --> 02:45:51.208]  I was glad to see that.
[02:45:51.208 --> 02:45:57.689]  And I look at Trump in a very, just a very pragmatic way.
[02:45:57.936 --> 02:46:02.759]  Do I know that most people are vetted or all people are vetted when they get to the station of being a president?
[02:46:02.799 --> 02:46:03.059]  Yes.
[02:46:03.420 --> 02:46:08.803]  Do I know that people can have change of hearts and maybe go a little off the wayward path that they are wanted to stay on?
[02:46:09.244 --> 02:46:09.504]  Yes.
[02:46:09.564 --> 02:46:12.966]  Remember McConnell saying about Trump that he wouldn't stay on script?
[02:46:14.468 --> 02:46:14.708]  Yeah.
[02:46:14.808 --> 02:46:15.348]  McConnell.
[02:46:15.508 --> 02:46:16.049]  No chin.
[02:46:16.149 --> 02:46:16.649]  McConnell.
[02:46:16.729 --> 02:46:17.570]  Turtle McConnell.
[02:46:18.370 --> 02:46:20.392]  Is he just about the ugliest dude you've ever seen?
[02:46:20.572 --> 02:46:20.912]  Anyways.
[02:46:22.785 --> 02:46:29.586]  Uh, the fact that he was elected again for Senate, um, I just, you know, whatever.
[02:46:29.926 --> 02:46:31.507]  Uh, anyway, in leadership of the Senate.
[02:46:31.587 --> 02:46:40.508]  So look, I look at these people and they all know there's a script and I think some people can deviate from that script or they're all part of the theater.
[02:46:40.548 --> 02:46:48.650]  You have to also entertain that idea too, that all of it's theater and that you have to sort of pick and parcel out what is true and what isn't true.
[02:46:49.170 --> 02:46:51.670]  But for right now, I need to put on my dumbass cap.
[02:46:51.670 --> 02:46:53.750]  (laughs)
[02:46:53.750 --> 02:47:01.009]   This is what I would think if I have that cap on as probably about a good 20, 25% of Americans
[02:47:01.009 --> 02:47:03.009]  have this cap on daily.
[02:47:03.009 --> 02:47:11.489]   Gee, there's three cryptocurrency tycoons that just died in mysterious accidents in strange ways.
[02:47:11.489 --> 02:47:13.129]  That's so normal.
[02:47:13.129 --> 02:47:16.369]  And so, well, it just happened.
[02:47:16.369 --> 02:47:18.129]  And there's just no reason for it.
[02:47:18.194 --> 02:47:19.836]  Oh my gosh, what are the odds?
[02:47:19.956 --> 02:47:23.339]  Because I'm a coincidence theorist and I think everything's a coincidence.
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:28.744]  All right, so you have three different people that died, right?
[02:47:29.325 --> 02:47:33.409]  And you have one in Russia, I think that was Tehran, right?
[02:47:33.429 --> 02:47:36.572]  53, who was the investing platform of Libertex.
[02:47:37.498 --> 02:47:39.879]  Um, you have all these different people.
[02:47:39.959 --> 02:47:41.979]  This guy died on a helicopter.
[02:47:42.199 --> 02:47:52.482]  This guy had somebody mysterious that just sort of basically did not show up for the flight when he passed away on this helicopter in this helicopter accident.
[02:47:52.802 --> 02:47:58.924]  So we've had these really kind of strange drowning on a Puerto Rico beach, died in their sleep at the age of 30.
[02:47:59.864 --> 02:48:05.246]  And then of course the Russian billionaire with spy links dies in this mysterious helicopter crash.
[02:48:06.207 --> 02:48:14.170]  And if I really didn't understand the news and I thought the news was always telling me the truth, I'd be like, wow, what a coincidence.
[02:48:15.171 --> 02:48:17.111]  Gee, you know what it reminded me of?
[02:48:17.331 --> 02:48:18.732]  It reminded me of the Titanic.
[02:48:19.552 --> 02:48:24.474]  And when John Jacob Astor was murdered in the Titanic.
[02:48:24.634 --> 02:48:32.737]  And when I say murder, I really mean that in the Titanic, which JP Morgan owned, and at the last minute just didn't show up to set sail on.
[02:48:33.018 --> 02:48:33.938]  Hmm, I wonder why.
[02:48:34.808 --> 02:48:39.150]  Uh, John Jacob Astor was one of those that didn't, he wasn't all for the central currency.
[02:48:39.210 --> 02:48:41.731]  He wasn't all for the beginning of the Federal Reserve.
[02:48:42.391 --> 02:48:44.672]  And so of course they wanted to wipe him out.
[02:48:44.732 --> 02:48:46.213]  What a great way to do it on a boat.
[02:48:47.013 --> 02:48:51.935]  And of course, uh, we all know that on the Titanic you got a special seat, right?
[02:48:52.155 --> 02:48:54.336]  Um, on a boat if you were rich and wealthy.
[02:48:55.037 --> 02:48:57.698]  So why in the world did he not get that special seat?
[02:48:58.258 --> 02:48:58.618]  Hmm.
[02:48:58.798 --> 02:49:00.079]  Gee, I'm such a coincidence.
[02:49:00.099 --> 02:49:07.243]   There's, uh, So, of course, there was a reason to take him out and several others that died in the Titanic.
[02:49:07.603 --> 02:49:10.905]  I don't think the Titanic was just an accident.
[02:49:11.025 --> 02:49:16.567]  I don't think they were surprised by a large amount of ice as they were plowing into it.
[02:49:17.548 --> 02:49:18.928]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[02:49:19.549 --> 02:49:21.990]  JP Morgan wanted certain people dead, okay?
[02:49:22.668 --> 02:49:24.349]  Then you have the Great Depression.
[02:49:24.849 --> 02:49:26.150]  Why did that have to happen?
[02:49:26.491 --> 02:49:28.232]  Why did they manipulate it to happen?
[02:49:28.692 --> 02:49:41.180]  And the reason they manipulated it was, if you are going in to replace, okay, your currency, replace, absolutely replace, what's going to now identify central banking?
[02:49:41.980 --> 02:49:44.862]  Maybe the crash was very necessary in order to do that.
[02:49:45.102 --> 02:49:48.124]  You had to do that to instigate central banking, right?
[02:49:48.425 --> 02:49:52.047]  Which is the reason that you would maybe plan the Great Depression.
[02:49:52.944 --> 02:49:56.946]  Right now, we all look at maybe a crash happening in the future, okay?
[02:49:57.387 --> 02:50:06.732]  I don't know if there's much of a crash that's going to happen as just the continuation of a transformation dropping us into digital currency.
[02:50:07.572 --> 02:50:09.013]  That's how I think it happens.
[02:50:09.073 --> 02:50:11.034]  I know CJ Evans wrote a great report on that.
[02:50:11.455 --> 02:50:16.318]  I think that's more or less how this happens instead of a huge drop.
[02:50:16.598 --> 02:50:18.799]  We're all expecting the Great Depression again.
[02:50:19.459 --> 02:50:20.420]  Why would they need to?
[02:50:21.258 --> 02:50:29.462]  If you're just changing the mode of which the whole central banking is based on fakery, right?
[02:50:29.662 --> 02:50:33.744]  You're not wiping all that out to give us something that is entirely new.
[02:50:34.064 --> 02:50:36.145]  You're just changing the face of the fakery.
[02:50:36.946 --> 02:50:39.207]  You're changing it to wipe out anonymity.
[02:50:39.387 --> 02:50:43.029]  You're changing it to make sure that all now are controlled by it.
[02:50:43.349 --> 02:50:44.890]  But it's the same base.
[02:50:45.090 --> 02:51:00.379]  It's the same bakery and it is the same foundation of central banking built on, of course, my friend Ed Griffin writes about this and the creature of Jekyll Island so eloquently about the takeover of this country in 1913.
[02:51:00.559 --> 02:51:03.721]  So you look, look at how this is happening.
[02:51:03.921 --> 02:51:05.241]  It's a gradual, right?
[02:51:05.522 --> 02:51:06.242]  It's a gradual.
[02:51:07.168 --> 02:51:09.370]  They don't have to have a Great Depression.
[02:51:09.851 --> 02:51:17.779]  They just have to gradually make it a lot tougher to live in this economy, a lot harder, edge you out of ever owning any property or owning a home.
[02:51:18.239 --> 02:51:23.104]  Maybe that's why all of the financial pundits out there are saying, ooh, rent.
[02:51:23.324 --> 02:51:24.265]  Rent is great.
[02:51:24.465 --> 02:51:25.967]  Oh, you'll love being a renter.
[02:51:26.387 --> 02:51:26.868]  No, you won't.
[02:51:27.950 --> 02:51:28.471]  No, you won't.
[02:51:28.811 --> 02:51:37.339]  Home ownership, property ownership is the only way that you can actually increase your wealth or increase your station in life is to actually own property.
[02:51:37.860 --> 02:51:39.441]  But that's not the messaging going on.
[02:51:39.942 --> 02:51:42.324]  And I do think that this is a slow burn.
[02:51:42.484 --> 02:51:45.247]  It is a transformation into that great reset.
[02:51:45.747 --> 02:51:50.091]  I don't know that a crash will happen, but I do know that that transformation is on steroids.
[02:51:50.592 --> 02:51:52.954]  And of course, they'll bring us through pretty swiftly on it.
[02:51:53.966 --> 02:51:58.267]  And they'll probably cause a couple of things like banking going down on a holiday Monday.
[02:51:58.967 --> 02:52:03.648]  And then of course saying, whoops, those hackers from Russia, those hackers from Russia are at it again.
[02:52:03.668 --> 02:52:06.409]  And they're here to screw with you.
[02:52:06.789 --> 02:52:08.449]  They're the problem, not us.
[02:52:08.549 --> 02:52:12.210]  We have the solution though, as we already started rolling out digital banking.
[02:52:12.450 --> 02:52:15.090]  Oh my gosh, what a great solution that is.
[02:52:15.731 --> 02:52:16.911]  How fantastic.
[02:52:18.211 --> 02:52:19.711]  It's exactly why they're doing it.
[02:52:19.871 --> 02:52:22.792]  They always solve their own problems that they create, right?
[02:52:23.775 --> 02:52:25.596]  Um, and so how are we going to deal with that?
[02:52:25.636 --> 02:52:26.936]  That's probably the bigger question.
[02:52:27.616 --> 02:52:28.617]  I look at FTX.
[02:52:28.637 --> 02:52:30.077]  I wanted to mention FTX real quick.
[02:52:30.958 --> 02:52:38.440]  The second I saw the FTX story and the money laundering in Ukraine, which we pretty much all know is going on and has been going on, right?
[02:52:38.600 --> 02:52:43.742]  Officially since 2014 with the Obama administration takeover of Ukraine.
[02:52:44.162 --> 02:52:48.204]  And of course you have Zelensky on a green screen asking for money every five seconds.
[02:52:48.840 --> 02:52:51.002]  And then, of course, we learned through FTX.
[02:52:51.342 --> 02:52:53.043]  Okay, no raid on FTX.
[02:52:53.323 --> 02:52:55.505]  A raid on my pillow, but no raid on FTX.
[02:52:55.545 --> 02:52:57.627]  A raid on Trump, but no raid on FTX.
[02:52:57.667 --> 02:52:58.908]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:52:59.628 --> 02:53:01.369]  Anyway, you have this FTX thing.
[02:53:01.650 --> 02:53:07.574]  And, of course, they want you to see that the money was laundered and went back to the Democrats.
[02:53:08.395 --> 02:53:09.335]  But here's the rub.
[02:53:09.796 --> 02:53:12.858]  They want you to think that it was money that won the elections.
[02:53:13.414 --> 02:53:14.575]  That's what they want to do.
[02:53:14.675 --> 02:53:16.697]  So they're going to give you a story.
[02:53:16.817 --> 02:53:19.799]  They're going to tell you a part of the story, which is part truth.
[02:53:19.819 --> 02:53:25.703]  They're going to say, well, yes, money is laundered there, as we all know, unless you're a total dingbat.
[02:53:26.223 --> 02:53:31.607]  But, but the money was funneled back to Democrats, as it well could have been.
[02:53:31.887 --> 02:53:35.090]  That could be very truthful, but it's not the reason for the fraud.
[02:53:35.590 --> 02:53:41.132]  They just don't want you to look at the fact that no one's doing anything on either side of the aisle about the fraud.
[02:53:41.432 --> 02:53:42.572]  The fraud continues.
[02:53:43.073 --> 02:53:44.753]  They didn't do one thing.
[02:53:45.253 --> 02:53:48.414]  When we walked into this last election, not one thing was done.
[02:53:49.055 --> 02:53:49.335]  Nothing.
[02:53:50.295 --> 02:53:53.596]  Because they still want you to think that money wins the elections.
[02:53:54.316 --> 02:54:00.619]  Katie Hobbs in Arizona never actually went out and did any campaigning.
[02:54:00.719 --> 02:54:02.579]  Kind of like King Fraud a lot, right?
[02:54:02.939 --> 02:54:04.760]  He didn't also do any campaigning.
[02:54:05.751 --> 02:54:09.234]  But all of a sudden, they're very popular and they win their state or their country?
[02:54:09.514 --> 02:54:10.635]  Doesn't make sense, does it?
[02:54:10.955 --> 02:54:12.136]  And not that you have to campaign.
[02:54:12.176 --> 02:54:14.197]  Everybody knew he was a bozo for 45 years.
[02:54:14.477 --> 02:54:15.338]  They made fun of him.
[02:54:15.438 --> 02:54:16.519]  Obama made fun of him.
[02:54:17.179 --> 02:54:18.921]  We know he didn't win that election.
[02:54:19.461 --> 02:54:20.542]  It isn't possible.
[02:54:21.242 --> 02:54:23.964]  And I know Katie Hobbs did not win that election, right?
[02:54:25.145 --> 02:54:28.587]  You know, Carrie Lake, she could be also, she used to be a liberal.
[02:54:28.628 --> 02:54:30.069]  She could also be a performer in this.
[02:54:30.089 --> 02:54:31.289]  It could be complete theater.
[02:54:31.490 --> 02:54:31.950]  You never know.
[02:54:32.671 --> 02:54:39.876]  We always have to entertain that idea as well, because it could be a saga, a play kind of, you know, happening before us.
[02:54:39.976 --> 02:54:42.798]  But I'll tell you this, it wasn't money that did it.
[02:54:42.958 --> 02:54:43.619]  It was fraud.
[02:54:43.979 --> 02:54:49.343]  And unless somebody can bring you clear cut evidence that money is what did it, I don't think so.
[02:54:49.503 --> 02:54:53.285]  Nobody votes for their country to go more into the dumper than it already is.
[02:54:53.866 --> 02:54:56.027]  Sorry, 80% of the country isn't going to do that.
[02:54:56.868 --> 02:54:59.970]  So I would say more or less a lot of those results, some were given.
[02:55:00.916 --> 02:55:02.577]  Some they said, well, we have to give them something.
[02:55:03.237 --> 02:55:08.219]  And then, of course, the other results were, you know, a complete fixed election.
[02:55:08.419 --> 02:55:10.520]  Again, that's how it works, folks.
[02:55:11.280 --> 02:55:12.600]  Unless we do something about it.
[02:55:13.001 --> 02:55:15.001]  Unless the people do something about it.
[02:55:16.362 --> 02:55:18.203]  I'm Kate Dally for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:18.223 --> 02:55:20.163]  I'm so glad you joined me for this hour.
[02:55:20.183 --> 02:55:21.724]  I really appreciate that.
[02:55:21.804 --> 02:55:27.123]   And you know, it's just time to start preparing and start getting together to make some big changes in this.
[02:55:27.123 --> 02:55:47.603]  I got some good news. I got some bad news.
[02:55:47.806 --> 02:55:58.898]  I thought we had enough free gifts of books and films and t-shirts and DVDs and all the rest of it, with every order, to keep it going at least until early December.
[02:55:59.218 --> 02:55:59.819]  Sorry, can't.
