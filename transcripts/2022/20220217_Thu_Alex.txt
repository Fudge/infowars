[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  The 1984 is 1776.
[00:14.000 --> 00:19.000]  Infowars has been banned, arrested,
[00:22.000 --> 00:27.000]  attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[00:27.000 --> 00:30.000]  The great awakening is here.
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.000]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[00:36.000 --> 00:41.000]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  and never give up the fight.
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.000]  Infowars.
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.000]  Thank you Randy and thank you all for attending.
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.000]  I'm not trying to be melodramatic here.
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.000]  I'm a physician, I'm a parent and I'm a Canadian.
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.000]  Every life matters.
[01:12.000 --> 01:15.000]  Every single life matters to a physician.
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.000]  These are not statistics, they're not zeros and percentages.
[01:19.000 --> 01:25.000]  The scale of death that's been happening in this country
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.000]  as a result of these government playing medicine
[01:30.000 --> 01:35.000]  is in an order of magnitude never ever seen before.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  It is utterly inexcusable and it makes me madder than hell
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.000]  as a physician to see the rights of physicians trampled on
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  so mercilessly.
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.000]  As Randy said, we have to be enormously grateful
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  to truckers of all people, guys with dirty fingernails
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.000]  said respectfully to lead us at this momentous time
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  when medicine and law and media and the church in particular
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  have failed in their duty to lead the population through this
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  and to oppose these draconian measures
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.000]  none of which have any real support.
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.000]  In fact, the measures that have been used,
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  I could say quite bluntly, have not only not worked
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  but they've made a situation infinitely worse.
[02:23.000 --> 02:26.000]  We would have been through with this mess six months ago,
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.000]  a year six months ago, if it had been treated with common sense
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.000]  like we've all done with previous flu epidemics
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  of which this really is not materially different.
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  Instead, we had politics playing medicine
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  and that's what's got us into this awful mess.
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  COVID is, in a very real sense, a fortunate experience.
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.000]  Yes, tragically, people have died, many unnecessarily
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  because of the denial of access to early treatment.
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  But we needed a focus.
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.000]  We needed the point of the spear sticking at us
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.000]  saying finally, Canada, wake up.
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  You're losing freedoms that you've fought for
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  so determinedly for years, for decades.
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  And now is the time to rise up
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  and that's why we have to thank the truckers
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  for leading us at this important time.
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  And it's not just the truckers and vaccination.
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  And by the way, a little digression here.
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.000]  Truckers can cross from PEI to Vancouver without vaccination.
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  American truckers can truck from New York to Seattle
[03:31.000 --> 03:34.000]  without vaccination. And yet to go north-south,
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  they need a vaccination.
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  This is absolute madness.
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  You don't have to be a rocket scientist
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  or a medical specialist to figure that one out.
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  No, we've reached the end of the line.
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  It really is a catastrophic intervention that has to stop.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  It has to stop immediately.
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  No dithering here. People are dying now.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  Pregnant women are being injected now
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  with an experimental agent for which we have no data.
[04:02.000 --> 04:05.000]  Does anyone here remember the word thalidomide?
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  Thalidomide. That could happen all over again.
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  Look at our children who've been affected the worst
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  of all the sectors in society.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  Our children, our most precious asset.
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  They've not only been suffering the absence
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  of non-verbal education, the smile, a hug,
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  being made to feel suspicious of anyone around them
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  that's going to last them life long,
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  but now they're being attacked by a vaccine
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  that isn't necessary and could well kill them.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  Is child sacrifice what we're all about in this country
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  to appease the new gods? I don't think so.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  And then beyond that, they're going to suffer
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  for the rest of their lives
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  because they'll be paying off the national debt
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  with the net result being a loss of standard of living.
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  That's what this government has done to this population.
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  And it has to stop now. Thank you.
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  They're transhumanist nightmare vision,
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.000]  suppressing the voices of good people all around the world
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria,
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  their world's going to end in 2030,
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  And none of it can succeed.
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.000]  None of it can actually be carried out
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.000]  unless everybody is silenced and gaslit.
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  And that's why truth comes with hard work
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  and with research and with diligence.
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  And that's why it's hard to share in Full Wars links
[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000]  and band up video links.
[05:58.000 --> 06:24.000]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[06:28.000 --> 06:40.000]  So, we were told by the same globalists
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  that have lied about everything that's ever happened
[06:43.000 --> 06:49.000]  that Russia was going to attack on the 16th yesterday.
[06:49.000 --> 06:53.000]  In the war-torn region of Eastern Europe that is Ukraine,
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  there's been a proxy war going on for eight years.
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.000]  There are thousands of devastated and burnout buildings,
[07:01.000 --> 07:04.000]  destroyed factories and power stations,
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  since the Russians took control eight years ago
[07:07.000 --> 07:10.000]  of that disputed border region.
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  And so the average American didn't really know
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  that there was artillery battles and rocket attacks
[07:18.000 --> 07:25.000]  and all sorts of house-to-house frontline combat going on.
[07:25.000 --> 07:33.000]  And so it was very simple to predict what would happen next.
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  The corporate medium, the controlled media,
[07:35.000 --> 07:37.000]  the ones that have lied to some of all these other wars,
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  the ones that are at war with us and our basic freedoms,
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  the enemy of the people,
[07:42.000 --> 07:46.000]  that they would then say, oh, look, they're shelling.
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.000]  Look, a mortar hit the side of a house.
[07:50.000 --> 07:52.000]  There's a hole in a house.
[07:52.000 --> 07:55.000]  There's a photo right here from Reuters.
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  Well, there you go.
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  Somebody blew a hole in the house in a war zone.
[07:59.000 --> 08:03.000]  Russia has attacked with its tens of thousands of tanks,
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  helicopters and jets.
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  There's the proof.
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  Doesn't matter if they're pulling back their main military drills
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.000]  they do every year.
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  Doesn't matter that three years ago they did a drill
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.000]  with 250,000 troops, not 100,000 troops,
[08:15.000 --> 08:18.000]  even the German defense minister saying that.
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.000]  It doesn't matter.
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.000]  The house got hit by a mortar or artillery,
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  a small mortar or artillery.
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  So that's it, folks.
[08:29.000 --> 08:33.000]  World War III, because they know the average American
[08:33.000 --> 08:34.000]  doesn't understand this.
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  Now, we were told that Russia was going to stage a false flag,
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.000]  an attack on their forces as a pretext to invade.
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  But now we're told, oh, Russia's firing artillery
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.000]  into the disputed areas in eastern Ukraine.
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.000]  Yes, my goodness.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  I mean, Biden told us there was going to be war,
[08:56.000 --> 08:57.000]  and there is.
[08:57.000 --> 09:01.000]  Of course, it's been going on since George Soros and Obama
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.000]  overthrew Ukraine and put in their puppets in 2000.
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.000]  And what was it, 2000?
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  It was eight years ago.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  How many years ago was that?
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  2015.
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  So this has been going on and on and on and on.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  And what did I say last week?
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  And what did I say Saturday and Sunday and Monday
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.000]  and Tuesday and Wednesday?
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.000]  In fact, I know that our archivist does an incredible job.
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  He can go find it.
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  I said on Friday, Saturday, Sunday,
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  we're doing emergency shows right now as there's so much happening,
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  that they would next claim Russia is going to launch
[09:43.000 --> 09:50.000]  an imminent cyber attack and maybe turn the power off.
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  And Jiminy Crickets.
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  What do you think Biden came out today and said?
[09:55.000 --> 09:56.000]  Just that.
[09:56.000 --> 09:59.000]  And if there is a cyber attack and the power gets turned off,
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  Putin did it, and the U.S. is going to nuke them.
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  That's right.
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  And darn it, the Russians cut off our Keystone pipeline, too,
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  and they opened our borders and they had drag queen storytime
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  and they promoted pedophilia in the news
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  and they devalued the dollar and they run Hollywood
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  and they ship the fentanyl in.
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  No, no, that's the criminals that have hijacked our country.
[10:20.000 --> 10:21.000]  That's who's doing all that.
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  And we all know that.
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  Russia is under attack just like the American people
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.000]  under attack by the same level as crime syndicate.
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  But here it is.
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  USS, not the U.S., I mean the criminals that have hijacked
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.000]  our government and hit our guts, the occupiers,
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.000]  say war appears imminent after shelling a Ukraine front line.
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  Well, that's it.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  We're going to have to go to war with them.
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  It says in Eastern Ukraine,
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  why a shell went through a wall.
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  And there it is, folks.
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  In fact, it shows a kindergarten class, of course.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  You know the Russians, they targeted that on purpose,
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  which according to Ukraine's military officials
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  was damaged by shelling.
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.000]  And it goes on from there.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  Oh, Biden says there's now every indication
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  that we're at war with Russia.
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.000]  Wow.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  That'll get you distracted from the fact that he's talking
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  about putting dead dogs on people's porches
[11:23.000 --> 11:25.000]  and can't even say Obama's name.
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.000]  He's so addled.
[11:29.000 --> 11:34.000]  There you go, folks.
[11:34.000 --> 11:35.000]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  If Russia attacks the United States or our allies
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  through asymmetric means,
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  non-conventional, kinetic,
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  like disruptive cyber attacks on our companies
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  and critical infrastructure, we're prepared to respond.
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.000]  We will be moving in lockstep.
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  He always uses the Mild Back Better Rockefeller Foundation
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  words with our NATO allies and partners.
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  Here's what he had to say.
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  If Russia attacks the United States or our allies
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.000]  through asymmetric means, like disruptive cyber attacks
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  against our companies or critical infrastructure,
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.000]  we're prepared to respond.
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.000]  We're moving in lockstep with our NATO allies and partners
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.000]  to deepen our collective defense against threats
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  in cyberspace.
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.000]  And, of course, we've got the U.S. diplomats,
[12:21.000 --> 12:22.000]  the British diplomats.
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.000]  They're all running around saying war is now happening.
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  Russia is going to war.
[12:28.000 --> 12:29.000]  He's been told for a month.
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.000]  It's imminent, 48 hours, total death, Russia.
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.000]  Oh, my God, an artillery hit a kindergarten building.
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  Of course, nobody was hurt, but, you know,
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  we're pretty sure it's the Russians.
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  They're targeting those kindergartners.
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  Here it is.
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  We are seeing information and data on Schelling.
[12:54.000 --> 13:00.000]  We're also being informed about Ukraine's efforts.
[13:00.000 --> 13:11.000]  So can we say that Russia is trying to create a pretext
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  by pretext for its invasion?
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  Well, that's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:16.000 --> 13:20.000]  So it's the pretext for the invasion.
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  I mean, you heard it there.
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  It's the total proof we've got to have war.
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  And, again, if the power goes off, the Russians did it.
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.000]  If truckers protest being enforceably injected,
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  the Russians did it.
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  If Americans don't like their currency devalued inflation,
[13:35.000 --> 13:36.000]  what?
[13:36.000 --> 13:37.000]  The Russians did it.
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  If your car overheats, the Russians did it.
[13:40.000 --> 13:43.000]  If you slip on the ice going out to your mailbox,
[13:43.000 --> 13:44.000]  who did it?
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  The Russians.
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  But, no, it's not the Russians.
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  It's the globalists, ladies and gentlemen,
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  that are destroying our country, destroying our nation.
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  Absolutely insane.
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  And, of course, Hillary is one of their top people.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  So she already said this years ago.
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  She said, we need to go to war with Russia.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  You pull the quotes up.
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.000]  If they hack us in any way, if they break in one computer.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  And, of course, the whole Vault 7 CIA data dump
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  shows that the CIA goes and frames not just the Russians,
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  but everybody for hacking, that if they hack us,
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.000]  we go to war.
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  And she said, including nuclear weapons.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  Because she's a good person.
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  And because she said so, we should all do it.
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  And they're all these weird, old, crazy people
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.000]  that can barely walk, who are barely kept alive
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  like two or three ambulances, follow Bill Clinton,
[14:35.000 --> 14:36.000]  Hillary, everywhere they go.
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.000]  Same thing with Biden.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  And they're doing these propped up weird mummies
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.000]  trying to destroy the planet.
[14:41.000 --> 14:46.000]  I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  And there's more articles out today.
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  U.S. say today, you name it, oh my gosh, false flag.
[14:52.000 --> 14:53.000]  The Russians are going to stage a terror
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  and tackle themselves to launch a war.
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.000]  I mean, it's just insane.
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  And you know why they're getting so scared?
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.000]  The wheels are coming off.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  They calculated their whole COVID-19 power grab.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  And their global ID and the social credit score
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  that comes out of it, the carbon tax.
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  But because that didn't go as well as they thought
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  and it triggered a big awakening.
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  And we told you last week, oh, the Moderna CEO
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  just dumped most of stock and deleted his Twitter.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  They're going to dump Moderna stock next week.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  I mean, that's a no brainer.
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  Articles, political fact, oh, it's not true.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  He didn't dump at all.
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  Well, he did delete his account.
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  And now, oh, Forbes, Moderna stock crashes.
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  Looses 140 billion as insiders sell millions of dollars in shares.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  But see, that's why we're the fake news.
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.000]  Because we tell you exactly what's going to happen next.
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  The truth is once you're dialed into paying attention,
[15:46.000 --> 15:47.000]  it's like they live.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  You put the glasses on, you see everything,
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  you take them off, you can't see Jack's squad.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  Info wars is the glasses.
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  Put them on, see the reality together,
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  and we can save the world.
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock.
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing,
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.000]  our products are game changing.
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  And so many people are deficient in iodide.
[16:12.000 --> 16:13.000]  It's not the soil anymore.
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  But when you get high quality tri-iodine,
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.000]  all three of the healthy types together,
[16:21.000 --> 16:24.000]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido,
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  but most importantly, your immune system.
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.000]  So, X3, the only tri-iodine on the market,
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.000]  highest grade, is now exclusively available again
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  at 50% off at infowarsword.com.
[16:36.000 --> 16:39.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine,
[16:39.000 --> 16:40.000]  and what it does for your body,
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  it takes about two weeks to get on average,
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  you really need to experience X3.
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it,
[16:46.000 --> 16:47.000]  I know you're going to be reordering it.
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.000]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product,
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.000]  you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body,
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  it's the good halogen, not the bad halogen,
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  and it funds the info war. A true 360 win.
[16:57.000 --> 17:22.000]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% offer, limited time.
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  Brother, I'm so glad you called elaborate on this.
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  Now is the time in your small town, or your big city,
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  to write something on the bathroom wall,
[17:29.000 --> 17:33.000]  or to put a sticker on your car, or banner hangs over highways,
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  and it will be a chain reaction.
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  I have a few ideas.
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  First of all, I'll suggest that when you fall into a farm,
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  rest out, rest while swab.
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  The vaccine is poison. There's kinds of things.
[17:45.000 --> 17:46.000]  I said, just keep it short, keep it concise.
[17:46.000 --> 17:47.000]  I agree.
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates.
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  The COVID-19 vaccine is poison. Beautiful.
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  if we could all be affected, so that's what I'm calling about.
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  God bless you, Chris. In Atlanta,
[17:57.000 --> 17:59.000]  I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[17:59.000 --> 18:28.000]  Thank you so much.
[18:29.000 --> 18:52.000]  Thank you.
[18:52.000 --> 19:08.000]  Thank you so much.
[19:08.000 --> 19:33.000]  Thank you so much.
[19:33.000 --> 20:01.000]  Thank you.
[20:01.000 --> 20:11.000]  Thank you.
[20:31.000 --> 20:43.000]  Well, this is an incredible time to be alive,
[20:43.000 --> 20:47.000]  and if you're not praying at least several times a day for peace,
[20:47.000 --> 20:52.000]  and you're up with the globalist trying to start a major war
[20:52.000 --> 20:55.000]  with a major nuclear power, then I think you're crazy.
[20:55.000 --> 20:58.000]  I know this audience of activists and beautiful people
[20:58.000 --> 21:01.000]  who have erased color and creed, who love God,
[21:01.000 --> 21:06.000]  are on the same page with me, but wow, wow.
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  Unbelievable.
[21:08.000 --> 21:11.000]  You've got an ongoing war, 14,000 dead the last eight years
[21:11.000 --> 21:16.000]  in eastern Ukraine, a civil war, triggered by George Soros.
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  He went on for Eid Zakaria eight years ago
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  and said seven and a half years ago
[21:20.000 --> 21:25.000]  that he got $5 billion of U.S. money to overthrow Ukraine.
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  Played the clip just a few days ago.
[21:27.000 --> 21:28.000]  Anybody can find it.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  It was all over the news.
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  They started it.
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  They created the discord, just like they do in America
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  with all the racial division and all the sexual division
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.000]  and all the rest of the crap.
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  We know who the bad guys are.
[21:41.000 --> 21:42.000]  It's the New World Order.
[21:42.000 --> 21:43.000]  It's Hollywood.
[21:43.000 --> 21:44.000]  It's the big corporations.
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.000]  It's the ruthless people using behavioral psychology
[21:48.000 --> 21:51.000]  on us to control us and run our lives.
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  Let me do this in this segment,
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  and then I'll come back and really drill into this next.
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  Let me just tell you what's in the news.
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  The DeBose Group has officially released
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  a big report I've got right here.
[22:02.000 --> 22:09.000]  It's from them saying that your world vaccine passport
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  will be the new digital currency
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  and that private central banks are preparing
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  to basically end all the currencies of the world
[22:15.000 --> 22:20.000]  once they've devalued them and used the funds to buy everything up
[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  while they're devaluing it.
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  And that you will be tied to a world ID for your currency
[22:28.000 --> 22:31.000]  and that you will be the currency under Bill Gates' patent
[22:31.000 --> 22:35.000]  that we told you about two years ago.
[22:35.000 --> 22:39.000]  Here it is right here.
[22:39.000 --> 22:42.000]  From them.
[22:42.000 --> 22:47.000]  That's a small piece of what we've got here.
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  I mentioned this before the last segment.
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  We could talk the entire four hours today about this,
[22:51.000 --> 22:52.000]  but we won't.
[22:52.000 --> 23:01.000]  Forbes, Madonna's stock crashes, loses $140 billion
[23:01.000 --> 23:05.000]  as insiders sell millions of dollars in shares.
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.000]  That was ongoing last week, and it's continuing on.
[23:08.000 --> 23:18.000]  The point is, is that we told you days before.
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  We have the incredible harassment of the Freedom Convoy
[23:21.000 --> 23:25.000]  and now not dozens of articles like there were a few days ago,
[23:25.000 --> 23:28.000]  but so many, I can't keep track of it, it's everywhere,
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.000]  that whiteness is inherently bad,
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.000]  major universities are announcing it, everything,
[23:35.000 --> 23:38.000]  and private property is evil,
[23:38.000 --> 23:43.000]  and freedom is bad.
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  That's coming up.
[23:45.000 --> 23:46.000]  Whole stack.
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  See the stack right here?
[23:48.000 --> 23:51.000]  That's just a small smattering of this.
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.000]  Then I got a whole stack here from all these different publications,
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  Corporate Owned, where they talk about families
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  and never show a man and a woman together.
[23:59.000 --> 24:02.000]  They show women alone or men with men with children.
[24:02.000 --> 24:06.000]  Again, total war on humanity.
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  That's all coming up.
[24:08.000 --> 24:13.000]  And on the Freedom Convoy, Ilhan Omar, I guess, has a bottom.
[24:13.000 --> 24:16.000]  She's not a bottomless pit of evil.
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  She says you shouldn't docks in person to people
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  for their political donations,
[24:20.000 --> 24:23.000]  especially women who you claim have been disempowered in culture.
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  Wow.
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  Hey, Ilhan, I don't care you're a Muslim,
[24:27.000 --> 24:28.000]  I don't care you're a woman.
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  Start becoming pro-gun, pro-freedom, pro-America.
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  We can be friends.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  It's always not too late to turn back.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  I've been a sinner too.
[24:36.000 --> 24:37.000]  I've been a bad person too.
[24:37.000 --> 24:41.000]  I just happened to repent when I was 18 years old.
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  Maybe she's got a little good in her.
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  Who knows?
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  But I'll give credit where credit's due.
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  She said they're bullies.
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.000]  Yeah, they are bullies.
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  They're firing people by the thousands
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  of the 90,000 that gave them the Trekker Convoy.
[24:56.000 --> 24:57.000]  But that's okay.
[24:57.000 --> 24:58.000]  God's going to open doors.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  You watch for those people at the right time.
[25:00.000 --> 25:01.000]  But they want to intimidate us.
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  I've got that in a stack of articles.
[25:04.000 --> 25:10.000]  And then I've got a little inside CNN information here
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  that I'm going to go ahead and decide to respond to
[25:12.000 --> 25:15.000]  because I actually know the whole inside baseball story of this.
[25:15.000 --> 25:22.000]  I actually know what's going on from the Hollywood top of the thing
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  all the way through the feedback loop of John Ronson and CNN
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  and how they're trying to create a fake story
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000]  and fence it through the news first so Hollywood isn't liable
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  when they put out a fake Alex Jones origin story.
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  So I'm putting them all on legal notice of lawsuits right now.
[25:38.000 --> 25:42.000]  So we'll be getting to that.
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  And I mean, I've got to sue these people just because here's the deal.
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  I usually ignore attacks on me,
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.000]  but what we've done resisting the globalists
[25:50.000 --> 25:53.000]  and how the public has made Info Wars a folk hero operation,
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  not just me, but the whole idea of it,
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.000]  we can't let them take that away from us and we won't.
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.000]  They're not going to say that we're racist or Nazis.
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  They're not going to say we rape people.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.000]  They're not going to lie about us.
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  That's why I've got to stay on air and fight through this
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  because we've got to battle these people at every single level,
[26:14.000 --> 26:17.000]  ladies and gentlemen.
[26:17.000 --> 26:18.000]  And a lot of folks are like,
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  well, just let Leonardo DiCaprio go ahead
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  and make the movie about you and demonize you.
[26:22.000 --> 26:23.000]  Won't you be more famous?
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.000]  I don't give a damn about Leonardo DiCaprio or any of these damn people.
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  Yes, I know all about it, dumbasses.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  Stupidasses over at CNN.
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  Hollywood, all of you are going down.
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  We're done with you.
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  And I'll tell you about that when it's time.
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  Because they want me to respond to a sit down interview with CNN
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.000]  and respond to a raft of lies and half truths
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.000]  and twist the disinformation.
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.000]  Because they still worship Hollywood
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  to then that they lie in the New York Times,
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.000]  if they lie on NPR, if they lie on CNN
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  and then create, oh, well, the news said this,
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  so we're allowed to make a movie of lies
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  and you think I'm stupid and don't know all that.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  That's coming up.
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  And so much more.
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  I mean, part two of the Veritas video got released
[27:07.000 --> 27:10.000]  that is just bone-shattering
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.000]  with the high-level FDA administrator
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  saying it's all about fraud, the vaccines hurt you,
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  it's a total takeover of society.
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  I mean, this is just nightmare stuff.
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  That's coming up.
[27:22.000 --> 27:25.000]  But, ladies and gentlemen, I can't stay
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.000]  in attack formation against the globalist
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  unless you are supporting us
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  and unless you're praying for us.
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  Second by second, I need your prayer, number one,
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  I need your word of mouth in this fight,
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  I need your financial support,
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  then infowarstore.com.
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  I don't fear death.
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  I don't fear prison.
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  I fear them shutting me down and silencing me
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  because that means they've silenced you.
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  I am literally committed to you 110%
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  because I'm committed to myself.
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  We are like timbers on a life raft
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  that need each other.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  You understand that? We are in this together
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  with you, humbly for what you've done
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  and how you've supported us.
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  I appreciate you and I'm telling you now,
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  we need your support more than ever.
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  There's one week left to get X3,
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  the Deeper Crystal Iodine,
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  with the two other types to block the bad halogens.
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  That is 50% off
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  and in six days that cell will end.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  infowarstore.com.
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  Also, back in stock,
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  very excited to announce this,
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  we're being sold out for six months.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  Winner's son, the highest quality vitamin D3
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  for low charge in your immune system.
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  This is the number one thing you need.
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  It is amazing. It all works synergistically.
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  It's back in stock 50% off
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  and it's been sold out for a long time
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  and folks love it.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  Brainforce Plus acts long term.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  Turboforce last 10 hours is great.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  This is quick acting and wears off quickly
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  but is amazing and it's really a brain-neutropic.
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  Brainforce Ultra,
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  fast, super clean energy back in stock
[28:51.000 --> 28:57.000]  50% off at infowarstore.com.
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  Now their whole project is falling apart
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  because the people are aware
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  that it is a world government
[29:27.000 --> 29:29.000]  corporate takeover
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  and so it's pulling back the curtain
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  now more than ever.
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  are not going to give up on their takeover.
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  Like Canada where they've now
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  declared a civil emergency
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  and martial law in Ontario
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  and other areas of the world are following suit.
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  Like Australia,
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  Australia,
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.000]  so pray for these folks big time.
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.000]  It's a very serious situation
[29:53.000 --> 29:55.000]  and stay tuned to infowarstore.com
[29:55.000 --> 29:57.000]  because truth is absolutely paramount.
[29:57.000 --> 29:59.000]  So I did it.
[29:59.000 --> 30:01.000]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[30:01.000 --> 30:03.000]  I've been training probably not
[30:03.000 --> 30:05.000]  as much as they should be
[30:05.000 --> 30:07.000]  but thank goodness for prayer
[30:07.000 --> 30:09.000]  and thank goodness for infowarstore.com.
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  Before I set out on a run
[30:11.000 --> 30:13.000]  I throw down some turbo force
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  to give me that energy I need
[30:15.000 --> 30:17.000]  to get going, you know,
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.000]  besides the energy turbo force
[30:19.000 --> 30:21.000]  it is giving me the vitamins I need
[30:21.000 --> 30:23.000]  like vitamin C to keep me healthy
[30:23.000 --> 30:25.000]  and the essential B vitamins
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  plus the amino acids for sustained energy
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  giving me the best chance
[30:29.000 --> 30:31.000]  at getting through the training.
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.000]  And then every day now I'm taking
[30:33.000 --> 30:35.000]  Dr. Jones' Sorilis.
[30:35.000 --> 30:37.000]  I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[30:37.000 --> 30:39.000]  So this is great for giving my joints
[30:39.000 --> 30:41.000]  the extra support they need right now
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  plus inflammation support
[30:43.000 --> 30:45.000]  and extra flexibility.
[30:45.000 --> 30:47.000]  These capsules help me recover fast
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  so I can get back to the training.
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.000]  Even if you're not crazy enough
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  to take on a marathon, good news!
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.000]  Turbo force that can still give you the energy
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.000]  and clarity you need for every day
[30:57.000 --> 30:59.000]  and Sorilis can keep you moving
[30:59.000 --> 31:15.000]  from any age.

[31:43.000 --> 31:45.000]  that someday we'll be millionaires
[31:45.000 --> 31:47.000]  and movie stars.
[31:47.000 --> 31:49.000]  But we won't.
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  And we're just learning this fact.
[31:51.000 --> 31:53.000]  So don't fuck with us.

[33:23.000 --> 33:37.000]  Welcome back. Thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday,
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  February 17th transmission.
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  Timothy Lassley is a great activist
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  out in the Pacific Northwest
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  who goes on a routine basis in Bullhorns,
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  and more.
[33:49.000 --> 33:51.000]  He's going to be popping in with us
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  in the second hour.
[33:53.000 --> 33:55.000]  We'll also open the phones up.
[33:55.000 --> 33:57.000]  Edward Dowd
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  is going to be getting in
[33:59.000 --> 34:01.000]  to the economics
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  and what's happening
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  with Wall Street and the banks
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  and where he sees all this economic warfare
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  going. You don't want to miss
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  either one of those interviews today.
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  But what's happening is
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  the power structure
[34:15.000 --> 34:19.000]  globally, the corporations are in decline.
[34:21.000 --> 34:23.000]  And they've tried to impose
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  their leftist ideology
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  as a new religion, as a control system.
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  They themselves don't follow it.
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  I would call them elitist.
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  I would call them
[34:39.000 --> 34:45.000]  elite capture specialist.
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.000]  And that's the term they use,
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  elite capture.
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.000]  And that goes back to the British Roundtable groups
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  and the British East India Company
[34:53.000 --> 34:55.000]  and the Dutch East India Company.
[34:55.000 --> 34:57.000]  The Dutch East India Company
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  how they would go in
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  and take over a nation
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  by buying off the economic
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.000]  business leaders.
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  And then the military didn't matter
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  because they would have already gotten together
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  their Roundtable groups
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  or basic corporate mafia type systems.
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  And that's what globalism is.
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  And that's why if you go back to the
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  Clinton's
[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  1995, 96, 97, 98
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  documents
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  that are in their
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  presidential library in
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  Little Rock
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  that came out via lawsuits
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  at the Western Journalism Center
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  and it says
[35:39.000 --> 35:41.000]  right there in 93, 94,
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  95, 96, 97, 98
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  there were big articles written about this
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  years ago
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  that if we allow conservatives to even sell
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  magazines
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  or nationalists to make VHS films
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  or have any culture
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  or any type of economy
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  they're the majority
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  and they will
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  organize and displace us
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  creating their own systems.
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000]  And so Hillary Clinton
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  is in these memos
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  that are in
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  their library
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  the papers of the Clinton's
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  talking about
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  the Clinton Chronicles
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  and how they had to stop it
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  and talking about Newsmax and Chris Ruddy
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  how they had to stop him
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  and how they had to stop Talk Radio
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  and Rush Limbaugh
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  and what they were really worried about
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  was the newspapers popping up that were populist
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  and conservative and Christian
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  and how they were writing books
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  and making films and building
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  an infrastructure.
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  That's why they deindustrialized America
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  that's why they sold the jobs out
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  that's how you economically capture somebody
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  as you get them under your control
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  and that's what the great reset is
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  is bringing you to your knees
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  bankrupting you to dominate and control you
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  you will own nothing, you will have nothing
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  or you won't get even food to eat at night
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  if you don't submit to it
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  they wanted to
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  to domesticate you
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  they want to
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  make you a total and complete prisoner
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  and so you can sit back all day
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  and analyze different elements of this
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  but the globalists think they're in charge
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  they think they own us
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  they're behavioral psychologists
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  they're super ruthless
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  they're more mentally ill than anybody
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  you could imagine
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  they have a goal
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  and they're ruthless
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  and they are taking control of civilization
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  and if we recognize who they are
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  and if we recognize what their goals are
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  and if we recognize how their systems work
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  and if we build our own systems
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  they will never succeed
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  in their transhumanism takeover
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  turning us into a commodity they own
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  that they can play God with
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  but if we don't build our own economies
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  on our own systems they're going to win
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  without saying you're small business
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  you're small school
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  you're small bank you're small church
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  that's not essential
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  we tell you what's essential
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  that's number one
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  we tell you when you can leave your house
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  and when you can't
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  we track everywhere you go and what we do
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  and we have ownership of your body
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  collectively and decide to put
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  in your body what we want
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  when we want
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  and we're going to cut your resources off
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  to save the earth because
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  humans are what?
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  humans are bad
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  there's that example I showed
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  from Germany
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  put up by leftist
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  big bank funder groups
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  and it shows a woman of your radio listener
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  breastfeeding a year old baby
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  or eight month old baby it looks like
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  with her three or four year old standing by her knee
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  the true image
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  of civilization and humanity
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  true beauty everything you need
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  the future
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  and it says
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  is it the future or a climate
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  killer
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  but if they can't get women to not have kids right away
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  we'll teach them men are bad
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  here's the cover of the last six issues
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  of the parents
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  two men with a baby
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  single mother
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  single mother
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  single mother
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  single mother
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  single mother
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  the enemy is a heterosexual man
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  because they want you all alone
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  they want you to be able to run over
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  believing the state is your husband
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  your pimp
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  and it's going to take care of you
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  yeah look at that
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  there's parents magazine the last few years
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  and nowhere
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  is a man
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  except a black man with a white woman
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  which if people love each other that's fine
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  but notice you cannot show that
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  95% of it
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  is that because there is a war
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  on anything homogeneous
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  there is a war that's why
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  George Soros says
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  China is the most evil country in the world
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  because they have a culture
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  not because they're communists not because
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  they're killing people he loves that
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  no no he envies that no no because they're proud
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  to be Chinese
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  and they have their culture
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  and they're not going to take on to themselves
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  whatever new thing you're trying to
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  put on them
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  they're not going to teach their boys
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  that they're girls and they're girls that they're boys
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  they're not going to do that because they know
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  that's how you destroy a civilization
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  do we hate somebody?
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  do you like to dress up like a girl? absolutely not
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  do we hate adults? we want to go have surgery
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  and have their nose cut off or have their genitals cut off
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  hey it's a free country
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  but you don't
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  target children
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  with that
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  alright let me do this
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  because I really am overwhelmed
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  I have too much news here
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  I mean this is just wild
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  what we've got
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  and you know that
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  Polish immigrant to Canada that's been arrested
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  a couple of times for opening his church
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.000]  they're now holding him without bail
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  under the emergency act as a terrorist
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  in the news
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  he's now being held for trial
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  and they're not even saying when the trial is
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  and he's not allowed out
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  for peacefully holding church services
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  he's been arrested what four times
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  and now under the civil emergency
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  they've decided to hold him indefinitely
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  that there it is
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  controversial
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  Calvary preacher denied bail
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  pending trial
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  on the border blockade charges because he went there
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  and prayed with people
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  and they said that was giving him aid and comfort
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  he's a terrorist
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  yep
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  lock and preachers up for preaching
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  in Canada folks
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  and the woman that runs the country
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  the finance minister
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  is the co-chair of the Debo's group
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  on the board of the Debo's group
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  Klaus Schwab and her grandfather
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  was the chief Nazi
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  propagandist in Eastern Europe
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  over the newspapers
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  in as far away as from Poland
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  to
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  Austria
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  in Western Europe
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  he reported directly to Joseph
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  Goebbels
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  he may have heard his name
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  he was directly under Joseph Goebbels
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.000]  at the highest tier
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  of the Nazi party
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  and of course
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  we could say well we don't blame a grandchild
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  for their, no Schwarzenegger
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  oh your dad was an SS officer
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  but you support
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  tyranny and say f your freedom
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  screw your freedom right
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  yeah
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  and so you are a Nazi pig
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  and that's why the Nazi pigs
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  over at the ADL give you awards
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  because they're Nazi pigs
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  and we're gonna beat Klaus Schwab
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  and Bill Gates
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  and we're gonna beat

[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  unsettling to see

[44:35.000 --> 44:37.000]  we continue sounding the alarm

[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  and we eventually will
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end

[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  get up to a years worth of storable foods
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  water filtration
[44:53.000 --> 44:55.000]  survival gear, seeds
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  shortwave radios
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  watch at infowarstore.com
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  I'm actually
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  people think I'm 55 years old
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  and I was already taking your other supplements
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  but I thought you know
[45:35.000 --> 45:37.000]  well maybe that's what I need to do
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  but when I started taking it
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  I mean it doesn't happen immediately
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  but you know over a period of time
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  I started noticing
[45:47.000 --> 45:49.000]  okay you know this is the ticket
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  this is working this is wonderful
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  you know I don't have to put on
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  derma blend anymore you know
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.000]  it works wonderfully and it really
[45:57.000 --> 45:59.000]  has totally cleared up my skin
[46:01.000 --> 46:03.000]  so I did it I signed up for the
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  Austin Marathon I've been training
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.000]  probably not as much as they should be
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  but thank goodness for prayer
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  and thank goodness for infowarstore.com
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  before I start out on a run
[46:13.000 --> 46:15.000]  I throw down some turbo
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  force to give me that energy I need
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  to get going you know besides the energy
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  turbo force it is
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  to keep me healthy and the essential
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  B vitamins plus the amino acids
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  for sustained energy giving me the best
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  chance at getting through the training
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  and then every day now I'm taking
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  Dr. Jones sore list
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  I have bad joints thanks mom
[46:37.000 --> 46:39.000]  so this is great for giving my joints
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  the extra support they need right now
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  plus inflammation support
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  and extra flexibility the quick release
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  capsules help me recover fast
[46:47.000 --> 46:49.000]  so I can get back to the training
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.000]  even if you're not crazy enough to take on
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  good news turbo force
[46:53.000 --> 46:55.000]  that can still give you the energy and clarity

[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  but we're going to make it through this one way or the other
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  God's watching and so we're going to do the right thing
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  we're going to stand strong and hold strong
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  and not back down
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  now I got a lot of world news
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  I want to hit next hour
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  a lot of big developments on the economy
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  a lot of big developments on the force vaccine
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  a lot of big issues with the next phase
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  the global is trying to launch a war
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  now saying Russia is going to launch a cyber attack
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  and turn our power off
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  and we're going to have nuclear war with them once that happens
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  that's what Biden is saying
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  put in place under Obama
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  removed by Trump
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  put back in place by Biden
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  very serious situation
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  that's why Biden said a week ago
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  last Thursday that we are quote at world war
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  with Russia
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  well Russia is not at war with us but the crazy psychos
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  that have hijacked our country
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  just like the Nazis took control of Germany
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  we got people just as bad or worse in control right now
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  and they mean business
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  and then their own little globalist
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  bubbles
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  they believe they can't be stopped
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  but I want to play three clips for you here
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  they really illustrate exactly what we're dealing with
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  the first clip
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  is very very important
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  they're all important
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  and this is
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  Peter Schweitzer on the communist Chinese takeover
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  on Tucker Carlson's
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  Fox Nation
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  show
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  and he's explaining elite capture
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  now I want the term elite capture
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  let's put this to the start of the show
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  to really burn into your brains
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  because
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  it's not just the chai comms engage in elite capture
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  and they have done it big time
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  in fact there's a pattern they follow
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  that would take hours to go over but
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  they control most of the universities
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  they control most of the democrat congress people
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  of any renown
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  who've been there any amount of time
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  the committee chairman and others
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  the Chinese don't give you all the pay off money
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  and give you all the US subsidiary
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  money and power unless you put
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  a known Chinese communist agent
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  over your booking
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  as your secretary so they can track
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  and trace and control and watch everything that's done
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  so your assistant your main assistant
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  must be a chai comm agent
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  in the case of Feinstein
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  the case of Pelosi the case of Swallowswell
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  the case of Governor Newsom
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  the case of all these major governors
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  the New York governor
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  the last one and the new one
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  the Michigan governor
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  the Pennsylvania governor
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  the New Mexico governor
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  the Chinese run it Chinese communist
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  and the FBI does this all of it
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  most of them are on the payroll high level as well
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  and so
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  there is an internal battle
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  even within the globalist deep state
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  with the Chinese now over full control
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  because they were supposed to share power
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  but now the chai comms have been bitch slapping
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  the FBI and some of the people
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  so now the FBI is like oh my god the Chinese took over
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  it's worse than I thought it'll blow you away
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  help us up yeah
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  exactly yeah we're screwed you figured that out now
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  you're bringing the whole country down
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  your money won't be good anywhere dumbasses
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  think it was cool to sell up to a foreign power
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  think it's cute
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  so
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  I mean you can go down the line
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  there's over a hundred democrat congress
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  persons who have a Chinese
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  agent running the next level is
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  they want you to have sex with their operatives
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  and of course you've seen all that
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  so it's just a standard deal
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  the idea though that China runs
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  elite capture
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  is like saying Chinese play golf
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  well so does everybody else
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  or hey there's Chinese
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  uh, pole vultures
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  well there's American pole vultures too
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  so we're not dealing with Chinese
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  we're not dealing with Russians we're not dealing with Americans
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  we're dealing with globalist
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  who have agents in all those groups
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  playing us off against each other
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  for power and control you're like that's like a James Bond movie
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  where
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  specters manipulate on all the sides
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  yeah that was written by number two guy at MI6
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  former number three at OSS
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  they're telling you how it works
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  so this is a battle of ideologies
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  and a battle of actions I don't know
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  who's the globalist agent who isn't
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  a lot of them we do but we don't know all of them
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  we only know a small percentage
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  at least a lay person like I
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  people that have access to that have a better idea and it's bad
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  but we do know
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  action like Jesus said you had tree by its fruits
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  I do know what people vote for
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  what they stand for what they march for what they
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  promote
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  and you look at the democrats it is the end of the country
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  so I don't need to know their CHICOM agents
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  I don't need to know their new world order agents
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  we have all the proof in their actions
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  and then of course you scratch the surface
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  and they're a bunch of damn traders
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  but they're not even Chinese
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  agents they're agents to anybody
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  that'll buy them off look at Hillary's foundation
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  just think of honor
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  they're the opposite dishonor
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  and so here he is
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  with Tucker in a short clip explaining
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  elite capture well
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  do the Chinese have half the prime ministers
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  and presidents and premiers in the world
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  no do the Russians
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  have that no the Russians basically have no puppets
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  except maybe a couple Eastern
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  European countries like Belarus
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  and Tajikistan
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  so does America
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  even have puppets anymore no not really
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  handed to the globalist the U.S.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  50 years ago controlled more than 60 countries
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  and a lot of cases was helping them out
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  and having good trade it was you know
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  I'm not saying I like taking over their countries
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  but it was a better than what they had
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  we don't run anything anymore
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  the globalists do
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  so American influence is way down here
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  all our influence is given to the globalists
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  who parlayed into China and now China
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  and the globalists are battling over who gets control
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  here's the clip from Tucker Carlson
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  I really wanted to look at the whole question
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  why is the United States so unresponsive
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  to China's threat
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  and I wanted to look at it from two aspects
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  I wanted to look at it from the China perspective
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  but I also wanted to look at elites in the United States
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  what their motivations were
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  the sweetheart deals that they get from Beijing
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  and what I found on the Chinese
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  side was this is a very brilliant strategy
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  on their part Tucker
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  they call it elite capture
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  elite capture and the theory is pretty simple
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  you know the United States is our rival
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.000]  even our enemy
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  so instead of going head to head with it
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  why don't we just kind of pay off
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  certain elements of the leadership
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  if we can capture them
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  with sweetheart deals with other benefits
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  we can effectively
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  lobotomize the United States
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  by making them unresponsive to our threats
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  so that became very clear
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  just looking at the Chinese literature
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  and then on the American side
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  I wanted to look at not just people in Washington DC
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  you know
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  political families like the Bidens
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  you know all the time because they don't have a lot
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  but I want to know what would prompt the guy
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  like Bill Gates
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  who's worth $100 billion
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  to go over to Beijing
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  and say the most ridiculous things
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  about President Xi and about the communist system
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  I wanted to try to explain that
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  and that's what I try to do in the book
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  by exposing all these deals
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  because Gates can then be the guy that
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  computerized China 30 years ago with IBM
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  Microsoft and take over the world
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  leveraging their authoritarian power
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  here's General Flynn laying out who the real
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  elite capture group is
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  the Debo's group
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  the World Health Organization
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  which has come into the news quite a bit
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  because of all this COVID stuff and the responses
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  but all of these global organizations
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  the United Nations is another one
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  all these global organizations
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  they think they see themselves
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  and those that are
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  sort of even above them
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  they see themselves as
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  this is how we can rule the world
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  this is how we can control societies
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  this is how we can control humanity
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  so let's introduce
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  something called COVID
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  and they did it for a couple of reasons
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  one of the big reasons was to steal an election
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  I mean if the Democrats
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  worked as hard
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  on foreign policy as they worked
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  on stealing the elections maybe we would be better off
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  but you know so
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  I mean there's a lot of things here
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  going on but yes these are
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  globalist organizations
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  these are world organizations
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  and when you start to look at
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  you know who is directing them
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  and who is leading them
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  there are real people behind that
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  and I you know I mean
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  Shraab is one you got a
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  George Soros you have the
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  the Arabella group I mean these are real things
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  these are real led by real people
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  who have placed themselves
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  you know Gates is another one
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  who have placed themselves above
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  some of these
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  world institutions
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  and they drive them they really do drive them
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  so identifying the globalist is key
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  here's another clip Justin Trudeau
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  is reprimanded in parliament
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  and accused by the main Jewish leader
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  of the conservative party of calling
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  Jews that are anti-police state Nazis
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  mystic hopeful vision for public life
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  isn't a naive dream
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  it could be a powerful force for change
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  if Canadians are to trust their government
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  their government needs to trust Canadians
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  those are the words of the prime minister
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  in 2015
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  these people very often
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  misogynistic racist women haters
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  science deniers the fringe
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  same prime minister
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  six years later as he fans the flames
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  of an unjustified national emergency
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  so Mr. Speaker
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  when did the prime minister lose his way
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  when did it happen
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  honorable prime minister
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  there's another clip that's even more powerful
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  but we're going to come back with it
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  but I'm going to turn it over to the leaders
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  Dave, Dan Lloyd
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  that's coming up next hour
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  they don't want this show heard folks
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  the enemies fighting around the clock
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  to stop it but humanity is rising
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  take the live feeds from info wars.com
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  share them with everybody you know
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  tell folks about those local AM and FM stations
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  go to those stations, find their live feed
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  cause that doesn't get censored as much
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  and share that
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  and whatever you do go to bandwidth video
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  and take the archives of these shows
[57:41.000 --> 57:45.080]  and share those with others, and then tell them to share them, completing the chain reaction.
[57:45.080 --> 57:46.080]  Stay with us.
[57:46.080 --> 57:55.080]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying
[57:55.080 --> 57:59.180]  and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[57:59.180 --> 58:03.600]  And when it comes to information, boy is that true today.
[58:03.600 --> 58:10.720]  We see the entire global corrupt, anti-human depopulation, great reset combine trying to
[58:10.720 --> 58:17.240]  collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing
[58:17.240 --> 58:23.760]  the voices of good people all around the world, and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[58:23.760 --> 58:29.560]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's gonna end in 2030,
[58:29.560 --> 58:32.520]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[58:32.520 --> 58:37.680]  And none of it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[58:37.680 --> 58:43.040]  silenced and gas lit, and that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and
[58:43.040 --> 58:47.680]  with diligence, and that's why it's hard to share InfoWars links and band up video links.
[58:47.680 --> 58:50.560]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[58:50.560 --> 58:55.960]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[58:55.960 --> 58:57.400]  a healthier life.
[58:57.400 --> 59:01.840]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement
[59:01.840 --> 59:03.480]  that contains both.
[59:03.480 --> 59:08.440]  This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[59:08.440 --> 59:10.040]  from the InfoWars store.
[59:10.040 --> 59:14.840]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[59:14.840 --> 59:17.560]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[59:17.560 --> 59:22.400]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[59:22.400 --> 59:27.080]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[59:27.080 --> 59:28.080]  shown.
[59:28.080 --> 59:32.400]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[59:32.400 --> 59:36.960]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[59:36.960 --> 59:42.080]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[59:42.080 --> 59:43.080]  like here in America.
[59:43.080 --> 59:47.920]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com where we promise
[59:47.920 --> 59:51.400]  our rose hips don't lie.
[59:51.400 --> 1:00:06.960]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:10.520]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[1:00:10.520 --> 1:00:14.240]  How much heat have you gotten for being friends with him and having him on the show?
[1:00:14.240 --> 1:00:15.920]  A lot, but I don't pay attention.
[1:00:15.920 --> 1:00:16.920]  Okay.
[1:00:16.920 --> 1:00:17.920]  Yeah.
[1:00:17.920 --> 1:00:20.240]  I just, I can justify it.
[1:00:20.240 --> 1:00:23.680]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[1:00:23.680 --> 1:00:24.680]  Oh yeah.
[1:00:24.680 --> 1:00:27.320]  He's a wild entertainer and a brilliant man.
[1:00:27.320 --> 1:00:28.320]  Isn't he fantastic?
[1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:29.320]  And no one is perfect.
[1:00:29.320 --> 1:00:31.600]  I've known Alex for like more than 20 years.
[1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:32.600]  I've hung out with that guy.
[1:00:32.600 --> 1:00:34.000]  We've been hammered together many times.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:37.320]  It's like, that is the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[1:00:37.320 --> 1:00:40.440]  Alex has been right for over a decade.
[1:00:40.440 --> 1:00:41.920]  Shout out to Alex Jones.
[1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:42.920]  We love you.
[1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:45.040]  Alex Jones is a journalist and member of the media.
[1:00:45.040 --> 1:00:46.040]  End of story.
[1:00:46.040 --> 1:00:50.160]  Recently, many of the biggest tech companies joined in a coordinated effort to censor content
[1:00:50.160 --> 1:00:51.520]  from broadcaster Alex Jones.
[1:00:51.520 --> 1:00:56.880]  There's a reason why the mainstream media calls a guy like him a palm thrower or conspiracy
[1:00:56.880 --> 1:01:02.120]  theorist because they're in fear of the truth that he does actually bring out.
[1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:07.160]  Why are the most powerful companies in the world suddenly so threatened by an independent
[1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:12.240]  radio show host in Texas that they're willing to lose business in order to make him shut
[1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:13.240]  up?
[1:01:13.240 --> 1:01:14.240]  He runs a media organization.
[1:01:14.240 --> 1:01:19.680]  And so when the January 6th committee subpoenas him, they're basically violating our first
[1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:20.680]  member protections.
[1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:24.820]  The Department of Justice says not only is it investigating what happened inside the
[1:01:24.820 --> 1:01:30.920]  Capitol, but the conspirators and instigators who may have started this whole thing.
[1:01:30.920 --> 1:01:34.920]  Now the committees decided to shut down one of the most popular journalists on the right,
[1:01:34.920 --> 1:01:35.920]  Alex Jones.
[1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:36.920]  Yes, journalists.
[1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:41.560]  The House Committee investigating the deadly assault on the US Capitol is subpoenaing Trump
[1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:44.960]  allies Roger Stone and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:48.680]  The committee says he helped organize the rally ahead of the riots.
[1:01:48.680 --> 1:01:53.640]  Alex Jones isn't simply innocent of inciting crime on January 6th.
[1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:58.960]  Alex Jones actively worked to prevent crimes from taking place on January 6th.
[1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:00.960]  Let's start marching into the Capitol.
[1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:02.960]  Peace for America.
[1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:09.960]  Notice, my dog Jr. said we're not burning buildings down or shooting cops, we're building
[1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:15.080]  America up, we're here to take our rightful country back, peace for me.
[1:02:15.080 --> 1:02:18.280]  We're not running interference for Alex Jones and we're not guessing about it.
[1:02:18.280 --> 1:02:20.280]  We happen to know this for a fact.
[1:02:20.280 --> 1:02:26.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, at the confrontation with the police, we're gonna make that the
[1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:27.880]  story.
[1:02:27.880 --> 1:02:34.280]  Alex Jones is a journalist the same as Brian Stelter and Jake Tapper and Don Lemon are.
[1:02:34.280 --> 1:02:35.280]  Absolutely.
[1:02:35.280 --> 1:02:36.280]  I was about to say the same thing.
[1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:37.280]  There's no difference.
[1:02:37.280 --> 1:02:38.280]  There's no difference.
[1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:39.280]  Don't insult Alex that way.
[1:02:39.280 --> 1:02:40.280]  Well, yeah, yeah.
[1:02:40.280 --> 1:02:41.280]  Alex Jones never lied us into a war.
[1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:42.280]  Right, right, right.
[1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:43.280]  That's true.
[1:02:43.280 --> 1:02:46.480]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:50.440]  And if Jones said that with Tony Fauci, he would ask him real questions, just as journalists
[1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:51.440]  are supposed to do.
[1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:53.480]  He wouldn't just slobber all over him.
[1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:55.440]  Epstein, he was way ahead with that.
[1:02:55.440 --> 1:02:58.280]  He told me about Epstein a f***ing decade ago.
[1:02:58.280 --> 1:03:00.480]  Alex detailed all of that.
[1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:03.080]  Alex Jones, info wars.
[1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:08.240]  The media has tarnished him with all sorts of name calling, conspiracy theorist, bomb
[1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:09.240]  thrower.
[1:03:09.240 --> 1:03:14.480]  The one thing that I know about this gentleman, Alex Jones, is that he loves this country.
[1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:17.040]  He is as smart as a whip.
[1:03:17.040 --> 1:03:23.280]  He absolutely believes in what he believes in, and he also does his research and his
[1:03:23.280 --> 1:03:24.280]  homework.
[1:03:24.280 --> 1:03:30.280]  Coolie compare Hotez's views on COVID to say Alex Jones's views on COVID and ask yourself,
[1:03:30.280 --> 1:03:31.280]  who's saner?
[1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:32.780]  It's not even close.
[1:03:32.780 --> 1:03:35.840]  He's incredibly detailed in his research.
[1:03:35.840 --> 1:03:37.040]  He loves this country.
[1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:41.880]  He is a patriot, and he's somebody who we better listen to, or others in this country
[1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:42.880]  better listen to.
[1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:45.680]  He's stretched to say that Tucker Carlson is the new Alex Jones.
[1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:47.480]  They're no vaccine passports.
[1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:48.480]  That's insane.
[1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:49.480]  It's Alex Jones stuff.
[1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:53.960]  And by the way, just so you know, as proof, if you want to get a job, you'll need your
[1:03:53.960 --> 1:03:54.960]  vaccine papers.
[1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:55.960]  All right.
[1:03:55.960 --> 1:04:03.080]  Listen, I started the show and had a lot of top news, and I got distracted by the control
[1:04:03.080 --> 1:04:07.280]  corporate press announcing we're now at war with Russia, because an artillery shell shot
[1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:10.880]  through a wall somewhere, and then I didn't get to the other top stories.
[1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:14.880]  And I was looking through my stack and I'm like, I'm just definitely need a vacation.
[1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:19.000]  We all need a vacation because my brain is just spinning at this point.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.480]  We come back, we're going to tell you the news.
[1:04:21.480 --> 1:04:25.240]  It's just huge.
[1:04:25.240 --> 1:04:29.120]  I saw this last night and couldn't believe it, and I went and checked the CDC website
[1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:30.120]  and they admit it.
[1:04:30.120 --> 1:04:33.200]  And then it's almost no coverage today.
[1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:39.120]  There's a big story about it on infowars.com, but man, it wasn't hard to know they do it.
[1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:43.120]  I mean, we predicted they do it, because anything evil they can do, anything corrupt, anything
[1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:46.200]  that rapes us, anything that robs us, they do it.
[1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:51.080]  But you know they did it, and you know what it is when we come back, right, everybody?
[1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:53.040]  You know what it is, right?
[1:04:53.040 --> 1:04:57.640]  You know what they did when they stuck that thing up your nose.
[1:04:57.640 --> 1:05:05.080]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[1:05:05.080 --> 1:05:11.200]  until the populations rebelled, they would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[1:05:11.200 --> 1:05:16.760]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:22.240]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:27.920]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:34.400]  that it is a world government corporate takeover, and so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[1:05:34.400 --> 1:05:35.400]  than ever.
[1:05:35.400 --> 1:05:39.880]  The problem is some globalist-controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[1:05:39.880 --> 1:05:45.960]  Like Canada, where they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario,
[1:05:45.960 --> 1:05:49.840]  and other areas of the world are following suit, like Australia, so pray for these folks
[1:05:49.840 --> 1:05:50.840]  big time.
[1:05:50.840 --> 1:05:55.840]  This is a very serious situation, and stay tuned into infowars.com because truth is absolutely
[1:05:55.840 --> 1:05:56.840]  paramount.
[1:05:56.840 --> 1:06:25.840]  When I grow up, I ought to be a rock star.
[1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:32.840]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[1:06:32.840 --> 1:06:35.840]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:06:35.840 --> 1:06:44.080]  So last night, it's about 10.30, I put my four-year-old daughter down to bed, got myself
[1:06:44.080 --> 1:06:50.040]  a glass of ice water, went and climbed in bed, and heard, bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz, no, text
[1:06:50.040 --> 1:06:51.040]  messages.
[1:06:51.040 --> 1:06:57.000]  Let me see who's text messaging me, and it was Eddie Bravo on our group text with good
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:04.440]  old Joe, and 99% of what Eddie sends me is accurate and real, but I saw this, and I thought,
[1:07:04.440 --> 1:07:09.840]  okay, this, this, this can't be real because we knew they would pull something like this
[1:07:09.840 --> 1:07:13.840]  because they've done stuff like this before, because he sent me a screenshot of it, and
[1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:20.480]  then I went to Twitter and I went to the CDC's website and sure as the sun came up this morning,
[1:07:20.480 --> 1:07:21.480]  it's real.
[1:07:21.480 --> 1:07:25.840]  And what was incredible is when I went to bed at about 11 last night reading this, I thought,
[1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:29.640]  well, surely by the time I get up in the morning, this will be all over the news, but I said,
[1:07:29.640 --> 1:07:33.680]  nah, it probably actually won't, kind of like Durham filing the documents showing Hillary
[1:07:33.680 --> 1:07:34.680]  illegally spied on Trump.
[1:07:34.680 --> 1:07:37.520]  I mean, he has the documents.
[1:07:37.520 --> 1:07:42.160]  He has the company they hired, how they did it, the people admitting to it, but almost
[1:07:42.160 --> 1:07:43.160]  no coverage.
[1:07:43.160 --> 1:07:46.200]  Hillary denies it, but that's what she does.
[1:07:46.200 --> 1:07:47.200]  She denies it.
[1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:48.200]  She was an ugly witch.
[1:07:48.200 --> 1:07:54.600]  Even though we all know she is an ugly witch, but her ugliness is not her real crime.
[1:07:54.600 --> 1:07:59.760]  So building this up, what do you think the CDC just admitted to?
[1:07:59.760 --> 1:08:03.960]  And of course, when they admit to something, that's because they know lawsuits are filed
[1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:05.840]  and this stuff's starting to come out.
[1:08:05.840 --> 1:08:09.000]  What did I tell you two years ago about the PCR test?
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.320]  I said, they don't work.
[1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:16.760]  It's a fraud so they can call any virus they want COVID so they can lock stuff down.
[1:08:16.760 --> 1:08:21.160]  It doesn't mean the virus isn't real, doesn't mean they didn't release a bio weapon.
[1:08:21.160 --> 1:08:25.320]  And I said, when they stick that swab all the way up in your mucous membrane, they are
[1:08:25.320 --> 1:08:26.440]  getting blood cells.
[1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:33.400]  They are damaging the walls and they are getting DNA and they're putting it in a legal database.
[1:08:33.400 --> 1:08:43.120]  Well, the CDC just came out and admitted and even put a video out and said, hey, guess
[1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:51.640]  what, when you got nasal swab, firefighters, medical workers, police, factory workers,
[1:08:51.640 --> 1:08:56.960]  Department of Defense people, everybody.
[1:08:56.960 --> 1:09:08.040]  When you got swabbed, your DNA was taken and put in a legal database.
[1:09:08.040 --> 1:09:11.000]  Every time they do it, it's a serious crime.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:12.200]  Blows HIPAA away.
[1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:14.240]  You're stealing someone's medical data.
[1:09:14.240 --> 1:09:19.000]  You are literally stealing the essence of who they are.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:22.840]  One big national talk show that I'm not going to mention wanted me a year and a half ago
[1:09:22.840 --> 1:09:25.200]  to nasal swab.
[1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:29.120]  And I told the nurse, I said, this is BS and I know my name gets added to the database.
[1:09:29.120 --> 1:09:30.120]  I'm not doing it.
[1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:34.360]  So she acted like she did it and just stuck it up on the side of my nose.
[1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:37.720]  But people say, well, what are you paranoid about?
[1:09:37.720 --> 1:09:39.360]  I'm not paranoid.
[1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:43.920]  Once they get your DNA, they can replicate it in a test tube and frame you.
[1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:49.040]  And federal courts ruled 20 years ago that babies that had their blood taken starting
[1:09:49.040 --> 1:09:57.360]  in 1975 in a secret Pentagon program had their blood samples given to the United Nations.
[1:09:57.360 --> 1:10:01.320]  And I had a nurse break this in 1998.
[1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:03.480]  And then later it came out in the news it was true.
[1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:07.480]  We actually broke that.
[1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:08.480]  And so we know this goes on.
[1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:11.800]  You know that thing where they prick your baby's heel with a little stapler thing and
[1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:15.200]  they say, oh, we're checking for a blood disorder.
[1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:17.080]  And I'm like, really?
[1:10:17.080 --> 1:10:19.400]  Why do you mail it to the health department?
[1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:20.720]  Why don't you just test it here?
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:24.120]  Of course, I already knew when my children were being born that was being put in database.
[1:10:24.120 --> 1:10:25.920]  I said, hey, I'm not stupid.
[1:10:25.920 --> 1:10:27.440]  We're not doing the blood test.
[1:10:27.440 --> 1:10:29.840]  I know that's into the health department.
[1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:32.160]  And they're always like, why no, Mr. Jones, I'm actually a listener.
[1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:33.160]  I'm just told to do it.
[1:10:33.160 --> 1:10:37.120]  And I'm like, yeah, we're not doing your heel test where you prick my son or daughter's
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:40.800]  heels and you stick their little feet on the deal and get their blood.
[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:44.800]  That's for a you in database.
[1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:46.120]  It's on record.
[1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:52.520]  I exposed it and blew it wide open with a nurse whistleblower from Fort San Houston
[1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:56.560]  in 1998 and then watched it break all over the news with lawsuits.
[1:10:56.560 --> 1:10:58.920]  But they still do it.
[1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:01.640]  It's organized crime through the medical system.
[1:11:01.640 --> 1:11:07.080]  So what's the big announcement?
[1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:12.200]  The CDC comes out yesterday and just releases a tweet with links to their site telling you
[1:11:12.200 --> 1:11:13.440]  how great it is.
[1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:15.720]  Oh, we didn't tell you at the time.
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:18.160]  We didn't give you informed consent.
[1:11:18.160 --> 1:11:24.560]  We took your DNA to sink what's new viruses so they can capture those, but also your DNA
[1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:25.560]  and we put it database.
[1:11:25.560 --> 1:11:28.120]  Oh, but don't worry.
[1:11:28.120 --> 1:11:32.400]  It's only 10% of you as if you can believe any damn thing these criminals say.
[1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:36.520]  Oh, you mean you've sink what's 10% now.
[1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:40.040]  Remember that hashtag COVID-19 no swab you took.
[1:11:40.040 --> 1:11:41.320]  Remember that?
[1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:43.880]  What happened to that swab?
[1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:49.760]  If it was processed with a PCR test, there's a 10% chance it ended up in a lab for genomic
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:51.600]  sequencing analysis.
[1:11:51.600 --> 1:11:57.200]  Learn about the process and its importance at the link right here and wired magazines
[1:11:57.200 --> 1:12:02.280]  telling you about it and the CDC underscore AMD.
[1:12:02.280 --> 1:12:05.440]  Isn't that just cute?
[1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:11.040]  Everything they do is a biomedical tyranny, a takeover of society.
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:14.640]  Oh, thanks for your part.
[1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:19.440]  Now we genetically keep track of you when we make you take these constant tests.
[1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:24.240]  Now we admit we're taking samples from you and just like that, they've crossed the line.
[1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:26.960]  No more medical rights, no more nothing.
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:28.080]  Where's Congress?
[1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:29.240]  Where are the lawsuits?
[1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:31.480]  Where are the laws blocking this?
[1:12:31.480 --> 1:12:32.480]  The answer is nowhere.
[1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:39.120]  That's why the Canadian Finance Minister, also a graduate of Plow Schwab's, just came out
[1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:43.600]  and said, oh, we're taking conservatives money next and all Trump supporters.
[1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:47.920]  Got the video clip.
[1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:49.360]  The talk show host says, this is dangerous.
[1:12:49.360 --> 1:12:51.600]  I mean, how wide is this going to get?
[1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:54.880]  Well, it's going to go to Trump supporters.
[1:12:54.880 --> 1:12:55.880]  Trump's an insurrectionist.
[1:12:55.880 --> 1:12:58.400]  You're not allowed to be involved with Trump.
[1:12:58.400 --> 1:13:00.760]  Folks, we're not getting into tyranny.
[1:13:00.760 --> 1:13:08.080]  We're here and these criminals never get held accountable for any of the things they do,
[1:13:08.080 --> 1:13:13.360]  the abuse and the stealing of our data and the surveillance of us.
[1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:19.360]  This is a bureaucratic, corporate biomedical rape of your body, of your future, of your
[1:13:19.360 --> 1:13:24.240]  medical identification, of your personal cells, your very DNA.
[1:13:24.240 --> 1:13:25.720]  They're not just going to change your DNA.
[1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:27.440]  They're not just going to cut your double helix.
[1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:29.240]  They're not just going to give you cancer.
[1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:34.520]  They're going to take your DNA because you're an animal to them.
[1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:38.400]  Like a monkey, they shoot with a blow-dark gun or charari and then take blood samples
[1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:42.680]  from or a shark they catch you, put a tracker on because you act like an animal, because
[1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:47.120]  you let them do it to you, because you don't stand up for yourself.
[1:13:47.120 --> 1:13:50.000]  You let them herd you through the squeeze, shoots, oh, you can go to the mall.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:51.240]  You can have your job.
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:52.240]  You can do this.
[1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:57.800]  Just let us put this in your body, this experimental shot, and let us take your DNA and send it
[1:13:57.800 --> 1:13:58.800]  off to whoever we want.
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:01.200]  Oh, they now admit foreign countries.
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:04.520]  The CDC wants you to know, oh, we send it off to other countries.
[1:14:04.520 --> 1:14:05.520]  Why would they say that?
[1:14:05.520 --> 1:14:07.200]  They're just throwing it in your face.
[1:14:07.200 --> 1:14:11.120]  Oh, we're going to have convicted pedophiles, by the way, come by at Drag Queen Storytime.
[1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:16.320]  Oh, the CIA in Germany, in one city alone, 30,000 kids, over 30-plus years given to child
[1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:17.320]  rapists.
[1:14:17.320 --> 1:14:18.480]  We're creating a new type of love.
[1:14:18.480 --> 1:14:19.880]  They said that.
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:22.280]  The new family is a man raping a three-year-old baby.
[1:14:22.280 --> 1:14:25.280]  They said that.
[1:14:25.280 --> 1:14:26.280]  Human animal clones.
[1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:29.360]  It's a revolution of just overrunning you with evil.
[1:14:29.360 --> 1:14:33.480]  So it's a big story, but it won't get out anywhere unless you get it out, because no
[1:14:33.480 --> 1:14:34.480]  one's supposed to respond.
[1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:37.440]  They just gaslight you with, hey, we're taking your DNA into whatever we want with it.
[1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:40.440]  Nobody else is going to criticize it.
[1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:46.560]  Massive CDC admits to collecting COVID nasal swab PCR test for genomic sequencing analysis.
[1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:53.400]  The Centers for Disease Control, a controversial post on Twitter Wednesday admitted that Americans
[1:14:53.400 --> 1:14:57.400]  who took the COVID-19 nasal swab PCR test may have their DNA harvested.
[1:14:57.400 --> 1:14:59.400]  No, isn't that liberal?
[1:14:59.400 --> 1:15:04.400]  Oh, and member of the Pentagon five years ago, back when it wasn't totally run by the globalists,
[1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:14.680]  said, don't do 20, whatever in me and all that crap run by YouTube's sister, the head
[1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:18.080]  of YouTube's sister, they're giving it to the Chinese communists, people are like, why
[1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:19.080]  do they want my DNA?
[1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:24.000]  It's very valuable, and it turns out that's happening.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:25.320]  So this is the same thing right here.
[1:15:25.320 --> 1:15:30.000]  Oh, by the way, the head of YouTube, I have it right here in the stacks.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:35.860]  She's called for governments to silence free speech, and that Google will enforce shutting
[1:15:35.860 --> 1:15:37.280]  down all conservative voices.
[1:15:37.280 --> 1:15:42.560]  So they're moving to their last phase, YouTube's CEO recommends governments pass laws to gain
[1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:47.040]  more control over online speech, and elsewhere, shut down people like Alex Jones.
[1:15:47.040 --> 1:15:52.800]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, L.A. Sheriff halted use of COVID testing provider
[1:15:52.800 --> 1:15:55.840]  because there's connections to China, and now you learn they took everything from you,
[1:15:55.840 --> 1:15:57.360]  and they will keep doing it.
[1:15:57.360 --> 1:16:04.840]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:10.960]  until the populations rebelled, they would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:17.120]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their laws.
[1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:22.000]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:27.680]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[1:16:27.680 --> 1:16:34.160]  that it is a world government corporate takeover, and so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:35.160]  than ever.
[1:16:35.160 --> 1:16:39.600]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover,
[1:16:39.600 --> 1:16:45.760]  like Canada, where they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario,
[1:16:45.760 --> 1:16:49.640]  and other areas of the world are following suit, like Australia, so pray for these folks
[1:16:49.640 --> 1:16:55.000]  big time, it's a very serious situation, and stay tuned into infowars.com because truth
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:04.560]  is absolutely paramount.
[1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:11.680]  In the words of Chuck Paulinique's fight club, dear globalist leaders of the great reset,
[1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:16.160]  the people you're trying to step on, we're everyone you depend on, we're the people who
[1:17:16.160 --> 1:17:21.320]  do your laundry and cook your food and serve your dinner, we make your bed, we guard you
[1:17:21.320 --> 1:17:26.760]  while you're asleep, we drive the ambulances, we direct your call, we are cooks and we are
[1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:32.200]  taxi drivers and we know everything about you, we process your insurance claims and credit
[1:17:32.200 --> 1:17:38.160]  card charges, we control every part of your life, we are the middle children of history,
[1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:43.640]  raised by television to believe that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars, but
[1:17:43.640 --> 1:17:50.720]  we won't, and we're just learning this fact, so don't f**k with us.
[1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:56.720]  Support independent media at infowarstore.com.
[1:17:56.720 --> 1:17:58.240]  Mike in California, thanks for calling.
[1:17:58.240 --> 1:18:02.520]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research.
[1:18:02.520 --> 1:18:08.080]  Now if you read the actual 2014 legislation, the U.S. government gain of function deliberative
[1:18:08.080 --> 1:18:13.880]  process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research involving influenza
[1:18:13.880 --> 1:18:18.680]  and MERS and ZARS viruses, there's nothing about ZARS-like viruses, and it's a research
[1:18:18.680 --> 1:18:22.840]  funding pause, it's not a stop, it's not a prohibition, it's when you come to a four
[1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:27.240]  way intersection, there's the stop sign, you stop, you look both ways, and then you proceed,
[1:18:27.240 --> 1:18:31.760]  and so it's also, it doesn't pause all gain of function, just selected gain of function,
[1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:37.280]  but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research, so you know, Rand
[1:18:37.280 --> 1:18:40.400]  and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right, they don't quite know what they're talking
[1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:43.800]  about calling it gain of function, you know, that's why he didn't perjure himself, that's
[1:18:43.800 --> 1:18:45.280]  why he hasn't been arrested.
[1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:49.480]  Because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do,
[1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:53.480]  but in the main definition, it's still a gain of function, they're making something deadly
[1:18:53.480 --> 1:18:55.200]  that spreads more easily to hurt people.
[1:18:55.200 --> 1:18:57.800]  Thank you Mike, we love you.
[1:18:57.800 --> 1:19:01.800]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days, with everything that's going
[1:19:01.800 --> 1:19:04.600]  on both at home and the world at large.
[1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:09.880]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep
[1:19:09.880 --> 1:19:13.920]  support formula, down and out, is just the thing.

[1:19:18.680 --> 1:19:21.440]  get the shut-eye you deserve.
[1:19:21.440 --> 1:19:26.200]  And to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with down and out, now the herbs
[1:19:26.200 --> 1:19:31.320]  and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[1:19:31.320 --> 1:19:36.160]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[1:19:36.160 --> 1:19:41.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the Passion Flower, which was traditionally
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:46.720]  used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[1:19:46.720 --> 1:19:51.000]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep, because you will
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  be down and out.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:20:20.080]  Selling it out now at InfowarsStore.com.

[1:20:29.520 --> 1:20:34.280]  So Timothy, lastly, has been doing a lot of amazing work, awakening humanity to the real
[1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:36.320]  tyranny of the globalist.
[1:20:36.320 --> 1:20:41.080]  He's a local Seattle activist who was red-pilled on fluoride being in the water.
[1:20:41.080 --> 1:20:43.240]  He was a Ron Paul Delegate 2009.
[1:20:43.240 --> 1:20:44.240]  He's a voted father.
[1:20:44.240 --> 1:20:48.280]  He's also number two on Seattle Antifa Kill List.
[1:20:48.280 --> 1:20:53.120]  He is the world's record holder for the most protest hours at the Gates Foundation.
[1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:56.120]  He is an enemy of all eugenicists.
[1:20:56.120 --> 1:21:07.400]  He's on Twitter at TI underscore M-O-T-H-Y-L-A-S-S-L-E-Y or Facebook, T-I-M, lastly, Timothy, lastly,
[1:21:07.400 --> 1:21:08.400]  you can find him there.
[1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:13.400]  Here's a few clips, there's literally thousands of these, of some of the things he's up to
[1:21:13.400 --> 1:21:14.400]  there in Seattle.
[1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:17.480]  And by the way, you talk about a place under globalist control.
[1:21:17.480 --> 1:21:21.120]  I literally cannot walk you on the street in Seattle without being physically attacked.
[1:21:21.120 --> 1:21:23.680]  Here it is.
[1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:30.040]  This bullhorn right here has only five hours on it, maybe tops.
[1:21:30.040 --> 1:21:40.160]  This one here has over 300 hours broadcasting the truth about COVID-19 from all the researchers
[1:21:40.160 --> 1:21:46.040]  that are not being paid by the Gates, the Fauci's, the Brazix, the CDC's.
[1:21:46.040 --> 1:21:52.000]  He's got anybody that doesn't have money involved in this is talking about what's really going
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  on.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:56.160]  You've bought into the cult of conformity.
[1:21:56.160 --> 1:21:57.840]  You should do your research.
[1:21:57.840 --> 1:22:03.560]  Go listen to that Rogan podcast with McCullough and Dr. Malone.
[1:22:03.560 --> 1:22:06.240]  Go do some actual factual research.
[1:22:06.240 --> 1:22:15.920]  Put on some skepticism for a while and maybe, maybe you might come to the right side.
[1:22:15.920 --> 1:22:16.920]  But until then.
[1:22:16.920 --> 1:22:17.920]  This is John Selby.
[1:22:17.920 --> 1:22:25.920]  We're at a pressure of 400,000 hospitalizations, EIA visits, and office visits, pro-vax, and
[1:22:25.920 --> 1:22:26.920]  injuries.
[1:22:26.920 --> 1:22:34.920]  Selby, we've topped 40,000 now coming from disabled Americans because they've taken COVID-19.
[1:22:34.920 --> 1:22:39.720]  I'll share links later on about the march, but this is Melvie Washington right now, and
[1:22:39.720 --> 1:22:43.720]  this crowd has been walking across the street from us two straight minutes.
[1:22:43.720 --> 1:22:50.720]  Two straight minutes so far, but we've got a good another minute and a half of people.
[1:22:50.720 --> 1:22:53.720]  That's right.
[1:22:53.720 --> 1:23:01.360]  You know, I've wanted to spotlight this fellow for a couple of years.
[1:23:01.360 --> 1:23:04.840]  I don't know who he is, but anybody we do that to, they just censor more, but I'm sure
[1:23:04.840 --> 1:23:06.720]  he's okay with that.
[1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:08.720]  T-I-M, lastly.
[1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:11.640]  T-I-M-L-A-S-S-L-E-Y.
[1:23:11.640 --> 1:23:16.640]  But the point is, he's on the ground, he's taking action, and he's waking a lot of people
[1:23:16.640 --> 1:23:18.560]  up in the third dimension.
[1:23:18.560 --> 1:23:22.760]  They're trying to censor us off cyberspace while we just fight harder in the real world
[1:23:22.760 --> 1:23:23.760]  in the third dimension.
[1:23:23.760 --> 1:23:26.440]  So, Timothy, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[1:23:26.440 --> 1:23:32.920]  Wow, you've got to feel vindicated with Moderna plunging 30% in one week, and the CDC saying
[1:23:32.920 --> 1:23:38.280]  in the FDA, don't give the shots to kids now, and just all of this, it looks like their
[1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:41.560]  house of cards is starting to come down.
[1:23:41.560 --> 1:23:45.040]  It's coming down, but the back peddling isn't enough.
[1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:48.840]  We need patriots, the state attorney generals.
[1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:53.120]  We need actual people that are going to put these people on trial for the crimes against
[1:23:53.120 --> 1:23:54.120]  humanity.
[1:23:54.120 --> 1:24:00.000]  I mean, they've completely eroded and erased society as we know it, and unclothed themselves,
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:01.440]  and how could we just ignore that?
[1:24:01.440 --> 1:24:03.120]  We're never going to be able to walk away from this.
[1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:04.120]  Well, I agree.
[1:24:04.120 --> 1:24:05.280]  We now know they attacked us.
[1:24:05.280 --> 1:24:08.920]  We now know they killed a bunch of people, and now they've got to have Nuremberg true,
[1:24:08.920 --> 1:24:11.720]  because they're not going to stop until we have Nuremberg true.
[1:24:11.720 --> 1:24:13.000]  No, they won't.
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  No, none of us are safe until Gates and Fauci are made examples of, and that example has
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.600]  to last for generations.
[1:24:20.600 --> 1:24:22.760]  And just like Hitler and others, they think they're invincible.
[1:24:22.760 --> 1:24:23.760]  They're not.
[1:24:23.760 --> 1:24:26.040]  I think it's important nobody attacked them from the grassroots.
[1:24:26.040 --> 1:24:29.600]  We want to take the government back, take the system back, and then we want them arrested.
[1:24:29.600 --> 1:24:30.600]  We want them indicted.
[1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:31.600]  We want them tried.
[1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:33.360]  We want them punished.
[1:24:33.360 --> 1:24:34.860]  Exactly.
[1:24:34.860 --> 1:24:37.920]  I don't want any harm to come to Bill Gates at all.
[1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:43.480]  I've been here over maybe 220 hours, and there's no violence, no cops.
[1:24:43.480 --> 1:24:44.480]  It's peaceful.
[1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:45.680]  I'm just here to get the word out.
[1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:48.760]  I'm here to alert the masses that are around the Gates Foundation.
[1:24:48.760 --> 1:24:49.760]  I'm here.
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:53.160]  All the pastors are biased, and just to show them that I'm not afraid of them.
[1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:55.160]  It's simple.
[1:24:55.160 --> 1:24:59.000]  The moment you don't fear them, you are a weapon against them.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:01.320]  And all you have to do is just get the truth out.
[1:25:01.320 --> 1:25:06.080]  And that's all I've been trying to do, because it's been ridiculous amounts of times here.
[1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:09.880]  This is my, today's 86, and you're 86 times.
[1:25:09.880 --> 1:25:10.880]  Wow.
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:12.080]  What was it like for you waking up?
[1:25:12.080 --> 1:25:15.640]  I mean, I see you were involved with Ron Paul in 2009.
[1:25:15.640 --> 1:25:18.200]  I'm being aware, I guess, of the fluoride and the water and what it does.
[1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:19.200]  Harvard studies you name it.
[1:25:19.200 --> 1:25:22.920]  I mean, what triggered your journey, where now you've been out there 80-plus times for
[1:25:22.920 --> 1:25:27.360]  hours bullhorning the true eugenics death cult center?
[1:25:27.360 --> 1:25:30.080]  Brother, it was you.
[1:25:30.080 --> 1:25:32.120]  It was you that woke me up.
[1:25:32.120 --> 1:25:34.240]  I had kids.
[1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:39.360]  You challenged me to enter the arena and have kids, and I did.
[1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:43.000]  And I've done it without vaccines, and I did it against the establishment.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:47.360]  But the head hospital pediatrician came down and confronted me, and he had media talking
[1:25:47.360 --> 1:25:48.360]  points.
[1:25:48.360 --> 1:25:55.720]  And the only thing I had to go on was what you advised was to ask for the box and inserts.
[1:25:55.720 --> 1:25:57.720]  And that's what saved my family.
[1:25:57.720 --> 1:26:02.960]  And once I realized that you weren't BS because, to tell you the truth, Jones, I found you
[1:26:02.960 --> 1:26:06.120]  and I said I could probably write a book and debunk you.
[1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:07.920]  And I did all the research.
[1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:11.840]  I took notes for three weeks, and I went out in the streets and I tried to debunk you.
[1:26:11.840 --> 1:26:14.720]  And everything that you have talked about was true.
[1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:18.600]  And so I was like, wow, it's off to the races.
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:19.600]  Here we go.
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:20.600]  But you're the one that woke me up.
[1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:25.080]  It's your compassion for humanity that lit a fire in me, and now I'm hopefully I can
[1:26:25.080 --> 1:26:27.080]  spread it to the rest of the people around me.
[1:26:27.080 --> 1:26:28.520]  Well, I didn't know that, brother.
[1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:31.520]  But yeah, I mean, I make mistakes here and there, but usually it's because I underestimate
[1:26:31.520 --> 1:26:32.520]  how bad it is.
[1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:35.880]  And now that people say, oh, I'm telling folks what to think, no, I'm saying, go look
[1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:36.880]  this up.
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:41.720]  And let me guess, once you started looking it up, as far as it's informed, it's way
[1:26:41.720 --> 1:26:43.360]  worse than what I'm usually even saying.
[1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:46.440]  I mean, sometimes it's stuff so bad, I can hardly even say it on air.
[1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:48.600]  It just sounds so ridiculous.
[1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:53.920]  No, the actual reality of it is horrifying.
[1:26:53.920 --> 1:27:01.040]  And what we can, as humans in this arrested development state, we can only address certain
[1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:02.040]  things.
[1:27:02.040 --> 1:27:06.320]  But the infrastructure they've built around us is nothing more than, and I'll coin the
[1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:10.200]  phrase right here, it's nothing but a forced eugenics labor camp.
[1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:11.440]  It's borderless.
[1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:15.280]  And that's all America has been my entire life, but they've had so many celebrities
[1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:19.120]  and actors just shielding away the truth.
[1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:23.640]  And now they're a part of the establishment and it's Plains Day.
[1:27:23.640 --> 1:27:26.640]  It's an open air forced eugenics labor camp.
[1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:30.560]  And we have to, as human beings, we have to oppose it.
[1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:31.560]  We have to save lives.
[1:27:31.560 --> 1:27:33.120]  We'll define that, because that's what it is.
[1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:36.600]  It is an open air forced eugenics death camp.
[1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:39.520]  They suck you dry, they use you, and then they kill you.
[1:27:39.520 --> 1:27:44.480]  Well, no matter where you go, a child is facing a threat, whether it's a chemical weapon in
[1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:50.040]  the food or it's a weaponized teacher, now they have masks on their face.
[1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:54.440]  So there's no, and it's all based on eugenics, it's all Malthusian.
[1:27:54.440 --> 1:27:59.640]  It's all the eugenics society just spreading across the world and building an infrastructure
[1:27:59.640 --> 1:28:04.440]  that built it in Africa, Europe, South America, everywhere that we think that we might find
[1:28:04.440 --> 1:28:05.800]  refuge, it's there.
[1:28:05.800 --> 1:28:11.440]  So we have to stand our ground where we at and just realize that we have to fight in
[1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:12.600]  all directions.
[1:28:12.600 --> 1:28:18.000]  We have to mitigate, we have to inform the public who wants to be murdered by a chemical.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:23.680]  Specifically once they want to give us cancer, they want to reap the benefit of us being
[1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:25.240]  sick in the medical establishment.
[1:28:25.240 --> 1:28:26.920]  And that's a horrifying fate.
[1:28:26.920 --> 1:28:29.720]  And that's how it's nothing but a forced eugenics labor camp.
[1:28:29.720 --> 1:28:34.000]  You can't participate in the system without getting some sort of side effect disease,
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  diabetes, cancer, you name it.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:37.760]  And they're waiting for us.
[1:28:37.760 --> 1:28:40.680]  They got all kinds of protocols waiting for that.
[1:28:40.680 --> 1:28:42.720]  You're a smart guy, Timothy, lastly.
[1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:46.800]  I want to come back and hear from you on where you see this going and how you think we stop
[1:28:46.800 --> 1:28:47.800]  it together.
[1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:51.840]  Because if 1% of what people out there listening did what you're doing, our problems will be
[1:28:51.840 --> 1:28:52.840]  over very, very quickly.
[1:28:52.840 --> 1:28:58.280]  Stay with us.
[1:28:58.280 --> 1:28:59.880]  Sold out for months.
[1:28:59.880 --> 1:29:02.520]  X3 is now back in stock.
[1:29:02.520 --> 1:29:06.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing.
[1:29:06.640 --> 1:29:09.880]  And so many people are deficient in iodine.
[1:29:09.880 --> 1:29:11.920]  It's not the soil anymore.
[1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:13.880]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[1:29:13.880 --> 1:29:19.360]  But when you get high quality iodine, all three of the healthy types together, it does
[1:29:19.360 --> 1:29:24.560]  amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly, your immune system.
[1:29:24.560 --> 1:29:30.800]  So, X3, the only tri-iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available

[1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:38.320]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body, it takes about
[1:29:38.320 --> 1:29:42.680]  two weeks to get on average, you really need to experience X3.
[1:29:42.680 --> 1:29:45.480]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[1:29:45.480 --> 1:29:49.560]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing
[1:29:49.560 --> 1:29:50.560]  what does for your body.
[1:29:50.560 --> 1:29:55.280]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the info or a true 360 win.
[1:29:55.280 --> 1:29:59.520]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off for a limited time.
[1:29:59.520 --> 1:30:04.000]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying,
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:09.440]  empowering, and fulfilling, it's going to be hard to attain.
[1:30:09.440 --> 1:30:12.640]  And when it comes to information, boy, is that true today.
[1:30:12.640 --> 1:30:19.720]  We see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation, great recent combine, trying
[1:30:19.720 --> 1:30:26.320]  to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing
[1:30:26.320 --> 1:30:32.840]  the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[1:30:32.840 --> 1:30:38.560]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030,
[1:30:38.560 --> 1:30:41.560]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[1:30:41.560 --> 1:30:46.760]  And none of it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[1:30:46.760 --> 1:30:48.840]  silenced and gas lit.
[1:30:48.840 --> 1:30:52.840]  That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence, and that's
[1:30:52.840 --> 1:30:56.720]  why it's hard to share in Full Wars links and band up video links.
[1:30:56.720 --> 1:30:59.840]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[1:30:59.840 --> 1:31:04.080]  Experience the next level in high powered energy new tropics with our latest brain force
[1:31:04.080 --> 1:31:06.240]  offering, Brain Force Ultra.

[1:32:59.720 --> 1:33:22.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:22.360 --> 1:33:30.840]  Welcome back to Alex Jones show, Timothy Glassley, a great father and activist out in the beautiful
[1:33:30.840 --> 1:33:36.680]  former city of Seattle, now under globalist control, joins us to talk about what's happening
[1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:37.680]  in the world.
[1:33:37.680 --> 1:33:44.160]  But here's a microcosm, it was like, what was it, last Wednesday, the CEO of Moderna
[1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:46.560]  deleted his Twitter, and then he deleted a bunch of other stuff.
[1:33:46.560 --> 1:33:50.720]  Then all the other executives, we went and looked up, not saying all the executives,
[1:33:50.720 --> 1:33:53.240]  but all the ones we looked up had deleted it.
[1:33:53.240 --> 1:33:54.240]  That people calling me, is this real?
[1:33:54.240 --> 1:33:57.640]  And I'm like, yeah, it looks like they're deleting it, looks like it's about to plunge.
[1:33:57.640 --> 1:34:01.280]  And the media's like, no, they're not deleting it, the stock's fine, because they wanted
[1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:04.640]  to give the big guys time to get out before they did it.
[1:34:04.640 --> 1:34:10.440]  And see, that's a perfect metaphor of what info wars and all our guests and our callers
[1:34:10.440 --> 1:34:13.760]  and what we do is, we're just not controlled by the globalist.
[1:34:13.760 --> 1:34:17.160]  We're not always right, but we're trying to be accurate, and most of the time we are
[1:34:17.160 --> 1:34:22.840]  right because we can see what's going on, doesn't matter if Snopes tells you, he's
[1:34:22.840 --> 1:34:25.800]  not selling a stock, Moderna's fine, stay in.
[1:34:25.800 --> 1:34:30.680]  Their job's there to just make you doubt long enough so they can screw you.
[1:34:30.680 --> 1:34:33.760]  That's how this works.
[1:34:33.760 --> 1:34:39.960]  And learning how the corporate system operates, it really is amazing the more you get deep
[1:34:39.960 --> 1:34:41.460]  into it.
[1:34:41.460 --> 1:34:45.520]  So I appreciate Timothy joining us.
[1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:49.240]  So in your big awakening in Seattle, what you're witnessing, I haven't been in Seattle
[1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:50.240]  in four years.
[1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:54.720]  We're into quite a few fans, but if I walk down the street, cars would stop, people
[1:34:54.720 --> 1:34:57.640]  try to run me over, people would jump out and throw coffee on me.
[1:34:57.640 --> 1:35:02.080]  I yelled at folks back, I mean, they really thought I was the devil.
[1:35:02.080 --> 1:35:06.560]  Is Seattle deeper in the throes of globalist mind control and mass formation psychosis,
[1:35:06.560 --> 1:35:08.240]  or is Seattle coming out of it?
[1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:13.920]  And then just key points you'd like to add about this whole biomedical tyranny you were
[1:35:13.920 --> 1:35:17.880]  talking about.
[1:35:17.880 --> 1:35:19.760]  Seattle is definitely waking up.
[1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:25.080]  There's a woman by the name of Victoria Palmer that has, man, she's brought thousands of
[1:35:25.080 --> 1:35:28.640]  people together and me and her are co-leading marches.
[1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:31.740]  She helped me, she's the organizer of most of these marches in Seattle.
[1:35:31.740 --> 1:35:36.600]  We had a thousand people damn near in Seattle a few weeks back.
[1:35:36.600 --> 1:35:39.680]  Then Bill Gates, of course, decided to chem trail and they could super cold, but we won't
[1:35:39.680 --> 1:35:41.480]  talk about that conspiracy.
[1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:46.680]  We can, but that's just another reason to protest Gates and his megalomania is the fact
[1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:50.960]  that there's so many crimes against humanity, this guy has been, he's got his hands in so
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:55.400]  many pies that are killing so many people that how can we not oppose him?
[1:35:55.400 --> 1:35:57.120]  But Seattle is definitely waking up.
[1:35:57.120 --> 1:36:03.040]  There's still definitely an entrenched liberal streak that will be hard to uproot and remove,
[1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:07.880]  but I mean, according to everybody's research, they're going to all be dead pretty soon with
[1:36:07.880 --> 1:36:09.640]  these COVID shots if they keep taking them.
[1:36:09.640 --> 1:36:17.920]  So, who knows what the world's going to offer us, but as far as our efforts, hey, this is
[1:36:17.920 --> 1:36:18.920]  how it's going to be.
[1:36:18.920 --> 1:36:20.520]  We're going to oppose the tyranny.
[1:36:20.520 --> 1:36:23.560]  We're not going to allow Inslee, we're not going to allow the mayor, we're not going
[1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:26.920]  to allow the school boards, we're not going to allow them to push us around again.
[1:36:26.920 --> 1:36:32.760]  This has really opened up everybody's eyes and we are not going to let them turn away
[1:36:32.760 --> 1:36:34.320]  and close your eyes after this.
[1:36:34.320 --> 1:36:35.320]  We can't.
[1:36:35.320 --> 1:36:36.320]  Well, that's right.
[1:36:36.320 --> 1:36:42.720]  The police chief, or the New York mayor who was one of the senior police, he ran on stopping
[1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:47.600]  the mandates and stuff and now he says, I got the article right here, it's racist to
[1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:49.160]  not want to take your shots.
[1:36:49.160 --> 1:36:51.760]  I mean, how transparent is that?
[1:36:51.760 --> 1:36:55.560]  Trudeau says the truckers are racist because they don't want to take an experimental shot.
[1:36:55.560 --> 1:36:59.560]  I mean, that is just outrageously, obviously bull.
[1:36:59.560 --> 1:37:05.600]  Well, Alex, identity politics is the new down syndrome for the masses.
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:06.600]  That's what it is.
[1:37:06.600 --> 1:37:10.360]  I mean, they're just basically dumbing people down every time they bring up race.
[1:37:10.360 --> 1:37:11.520]  I don't care about your race.
[1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:13.240]  I don't care about anything.
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:17.520]  I want you to not be murdered by Bill Gates and I hopefully you have that feeling for
[1:37:17.520 --> 1:37:23.680]  me at the same time and all of these eugenicists and I hope that my efforts are putting, I
[1:37:23.680 --> 1:37:26.720]  don't want the Gates Foundation to have a victory lap.
[1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:31.000]  I've been out here, when you put out that Francis Boyle interview about the gain of
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  function, that's when I decided to come out here and start protesting the Gates Foundation
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:39.200]  because I knew they were involved and I knew it would all come out and it slowly is.
[1:37:39.200 --> 1:37:46.720]  It's just, we have to, yeah, we just have to just shed our fear and it become warriors
[1:37:46.720 --> 1:37:47.720]  with truth.
[1:37:47.720 --> 1:37:52.120]  I'm not violent, there's just no violence on my record, but I'm definitely going to
[1:37:52.120 --> 1:37:53.120]  be here.
[1:37:53.120 --> 1:37:55.520]  I'm tenacious and I'm never going to give up.
[1:37:55.520 --> 1:37:59.840]  And what's crazy is how accurate Boyle was, the guy that wrote the US biological weapons
[1:37:59.840 --> 1:38:04.200]  law, former top UN prosecutor showing everybody that UN is bad.
[1:38:04.200 --> 1:38:07.640]  He came out day one and predicted it would give you HIV-like symptoms.
[1:38:07.640 --> 1:38:11.780]  He came out and predicted that it would erase your immune system because obviously he didn't
[1:38:11.780 --> 1:38:15.960]  just predict that he has a lot of sources, very frightening stuff.
[1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:19.600]  To now see it all happen, like he said.
[1:38:19.600 --> 1:38:24.920]  It's horribly frightening and I got a hold of a documentary in Lies We Trust.
[1:38:24.920 --> 1:38:27.880]  I don't know if you've watched it, it's with Dr. Leonard Horowitz, the guy that designed
[1:38:27.880 --> 1:38:29.960]  infomercials back in the 80s.
[1:38:29.960 --> 1:38:34.840]  That really woke me up and then to see it all just explode in our faces the way it was.
[1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:39.040]  Oh yeah, Horowitz was a complete and absolute trailblazer and then I think all the knowledge
[1:38:39.040 --> 1:38:43.320]  of this kind of went, he went a little, I've gone crazy too, I'm not putting him down but
[1:38:43.320 --> 1:38:51.360]  Horowitz definitely was way ahead of his time and I think the knowledge drove him mad.
[1:38:51.360 --> 1:38:52.360]  It's easy to do.
[1:38:52.360 --> 1:38:56.880]  If you don't see positive returns and you just see darkness at every horizon, I feel
[1:38:56.880 --> 1:38:57.880]  for you.
[1:38:57.880 --> 1:39:02.000]  Well that's a problem with people that have 150 IQs, I mean I know Horowitz well, he's
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:06.400]  a very smart guy but he just, I mean I have trouble not going crazy knowing all this.
[1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:07.400]  How do you handle it?
[1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:11.160]  Because I mean this is like, it's like the military gets tired of me in the two, three
[1:39:11.160 --> 1:39:15.640]  year war, special ops, even more intense, they all go crazy doing it.
[1:39:15.640 --> 1:39:18.840]  Once the world wakes up that we're all in a war and under attack, people are going to
[1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:21.440]  realize, I mean because I've been doing this forever and I'm like saying I'm some veteran,
[1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:25.200]  I'm some great soldier but let me tell you, I have been in a damn war for 28 years.
[1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:28.040]  I know how real this is and as the public figures that out, I don't wonder how they're
[1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:29.040]  going to handle it.
[1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:32.160]  How have you handled it?
[1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:34.880]  Sometimes I've handled it well, sometimes I haven't handled it right.
[1:39:34.880 --> 1:39:39.880]  I've lost all of my family because of this because I wanted them to wake up, I didn't
[1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:42.720]  want them to be hurt but I might have pushed them away.
[1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:49.120]  So it's cost me tremendous, I mean I flew way, way too close to the sun and I don't
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:50.120]  care.
[1:39:50.120 --> 1:39:53.960]  At the same point I did it for all the right reasons so if my road to hell is paved with
[1:39:53.960 --> 1:39:55.600]  good intentions, so be it.
[1:39:55.600 --> 1:40:01.120]  I still know that I'm right and I'm not going to shut up and I hope that it affects people
[1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:04.600]  because if I don't see that's the thing.
[1:40:04.600 --> 1:40:08.680]  We've got all this darkness in us because we've learned it all but if we don't do something
[1:40:08.680 --> 1:40:13.440]  with it, if we don't oppose the evil, then it's just going to eat us alive.
[1:40:13.440 --> 1:40:17.640]  Exactly, I get upset by night and then empowered by day fighting it, exactly, like I'll be
[1:40:17.640 --> 1:40:21.600]  researching this stuff and it's just like, I can't believe our own fellow humans act
[1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:22.600]  like this.
[1:40:22.600 --> 1:40:25.200]  I mean this is evil.
[1:40:25.200 --> 1:40:26.960]  They're hostages.
[1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:27.960]  They're hostages by the Psyop.
[1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:33.840]  No you're right, most people serving under, I'm sorry, elaborate on that.
[1:40:33.840 --> 1:40:38.160]  Well we were raised by Madison Market and Edward Bernays, he already had America co-opted
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:42.840]  and everything established before I was born and before you were born and so our parents
[1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:47.600]  just thought that that was the way to get along and now they basically just threw us
[1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:52.160]  in the bear trap and nobody sprung it up until now but it was always a bear trap.
[1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:58.040]  It was never designed to be this peaceful society and we're not supposed to go to the
[1:40:58.040 --> 1:40:59.040]  stars, Alex.
[1:40:59.040 --> 1:41:03.880]  We're supposed to be in mass graves by 2030, right, according to the Diegel report.
[1:41:03.880 --> 1:41:07.120]  And they've got new TV shows where we eat bugs in the future.
[1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:08.120]  The rich do.
[1:41:08.120 --> 1:41:11.120]  So they're telling you, you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, robots run your life
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:13.440]  and you eat bugs and people think, well they'll never do that.
[1:41:13.440 --> 1:41:19.040]  No, it's part of their ritualized humiliation of us, which is their religion vampirically
[1:41:19.040 --> 1:41:23.120]  destroying our incredible potential, is their energy source.
[1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:26.600]  Absolutely, and I will not be in that ritual.
[1:41:26.600 --> 1:41:30.040]  I'm not going to be ritually sacrificed, my kids aren't going to be ritually sacrificed.
[1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:34.440]  I know with the intentions upon all of the message that they put at my children and at
[1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:37.760]  me and I refuse to be in the sacrifice, you know.
[1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:42.240]  So that's what we all have to come to grips with, is that are we going to participate
[1:41:42.240 --> 1:41:47.560]  in the sacrifice and that sacrifice, it's every freaking second, you know, we have to
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:51.680]  keep our guard up, we have to pray to God, I mean I'm in God's hands right now, thank
[1:41:51.680 --> 1:41:54.600]  the Lord for his protection at this point in time.
[1:41:54.600 --> 1:42:01.840]  It has been tremendous and you've brought me, you literally, I mean you know, I've come
[1:42:01.840 --> 1:42:06.680]  across your research and I've listened to your words because they're powerful and you've
[1:42:06.680 --> 1:42:13.800]  got a way of, you have a yearning to touch people's hearts and souls and it's true and
[1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:20.360]  it's convincing brother and you've brought me to God and Christ and I hope that I'm worthy
[1:42:20.360 --> 1:42:24.520]  of this incredible responsibility but I'm not afraid.
[1:42:24.520 --> 1:42:28.680]  Well brother, none of us are worthy but through Christ we're all worthy and we're all brought
[1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:30.400]  to the next level but you're right.
[1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:34.000]  This is the big challenge, this is the big war, this is the war for the future and it's
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:38.080]  all very transactional, they're going to try to cut the resources off so we transactionally
[1:42:38.080 --> 1:42:42.920]  give over our free will knowingly to the system and then lose our eternal capital they're
[1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:47.200]  trying to steal so don't fear who he can kill the body but he can kill the soul.
[1:42:47.200 --> 1:42:51.680]  We'll be right back with our special guest who's bullhorned 80 plus times for hours
[1:42:51.680 --> 1:42:54.800]  on end, the Bill of Millindigates, Worldwide Death Center.
[1:42:54.800 --> 1:43:01.240]  With the world awakening, I think it was important that we were right there, prevent
[1:43:01.240 --> 1:43:04.600]  them right now, take advantage of this moment and I have always had an idea that something
[1:43:04.600 --> 1:43:08.400]  everybody can do but every listener can do, I think it'd be powerful and effective for
[1:43:08.400 --> 1:43:13.240]  us to hang the banners over highways, imagine if you're not being an artiste or a lay-up
[1:43:13.240 --> 1:43:18.000]  man, it says Alex Jones is right, info wars dot karma, we stand with the truckers, arrest
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  scouts or whatever it is.
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:23.320]  Brother, I'm so glad you called, elaborate on this, yes, now is the time in your small
[1:43:23.320 --> 1:43:27.480]  town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on
[1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:33.400]  your car or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain reaction, what do you recommend
[1:43:33.400 --> 1:43:34.800]  people say on these banner hangs?
[1:43:34.800 --> 1:43:42.280]  I have a few ideas, arrest scouts, arrest swabs, the vaccine is poison, there's tons of things,
[1:43:42.280 --> 1:43:44.120]  I say just keep it short, keep it concise.
[1:43:44.120 --> 1:43:48.920]  No, I agree, arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates, the COVID-vaxx is poison, beautiful.
[1:43:48.920 --> 1:43:52.400]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved and we could all be effective though, that's
[1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:53.400]  what I'm calling about.
[1:43:53.400 --> 1:43:57.680]  God bless you Chris, in Atlanta I really, really appreciate you calling us today, thank
[1:43:57.680 --> 1:43:58.680]  you so much.
[1:43:58.680 --> 1:44:03.560]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist, I wanted
[1:44:03.560 --> 1:44:09.000]  to stop their agenda, I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  before they went operational, but we failed, yes a lot of people are awake, yes we're not
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:20.400]  getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:25.240]  great reset and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[1:44:25.240 --> 1:44:29.240]  tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to
[1:44:29.240 --> 1:44:30.240]  hear the truth.
[1:44:30.240 --> 1:44:33.720]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, we've
[1:44:33.720 --> 1:44:37.520]  also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one things to do is high quality
[1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:43.200]  storeable food, we've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[1:44:43.200 --> 1:44:47.240]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[1:44:47.240 --> 1:44:52.600]  to ship right now, lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long
[1:44:52.600 --> 1:45:00.520]  lines and waits because believe me, serious times are coming, get ready at infowarstore.com.
[1:45:00.520 --> 1:45:10.520]  If you only knew the power of the dark side, join Bill Gates and together we will defeat
[1:45:10.520 --> 1:45:18.760]  humanity, then our God save will reward us with eternal life.
[1:45:18.760 --> 1:45:23.240]  It's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:29.300]  They must first play God, they must first prove that they are the fittest in their social
[1:45:29.300 --> 1:45:34.800]  Darwinistic system and in a way they're right if we let them lie to us and dump us down
[1:45:34.800 --> 1:45:39.720]  and poison us and destroy our children's futures, the evidence is overwhelming and out in the
[1:45:39.720 --> 1:45:43.840]  open we really deserve what's happened to us.
[1:45:43.840 --> 1:45:50.160]  So I ask you now, are you going to step up and expose the dual order even more?
[1:45:50.160 --> 1:45:53.960]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[1:45:53.960 --> 1:45:57.840]  The front lines of the fight is infowarstore.com.
[1:45:57.840 --> 1:46:03.440]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here all over the world from Australia to
[1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:05.840]  the United States from Canada to Germany.
[1:46:05.840 --> 1:46:09.320]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your
[1:46:09.320 --> 1:46:15.040]  house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their
[1:46:15.040 --> 1:46:20.200]  facilities and they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where
[1:46:20.200 --> 1:46:24.800]  they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:28.440]  This is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is
[1:46:28.440 --> 1:46:32.780]  to get high quality Faraday cages many of which are made here in America and are very
[1:46:32.780 --> 1:46:37.720]  compliant meaning U.S. government military grade at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:37.720 --> 1:46:42.720]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com.
[1:46:42.720 --> 1:46:48.120]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones,
[1:46:48.120 --> 1:46:53.240]  we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads, it's all there at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:53.240 --> 1:46:59.280]  So protect your privacy today and support the infowar at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:59.280 --> 1:47:23.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:23.080 --> 1:47:29.120]  When you project your own good intentions on to corrupt tyrants whether they be in history
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:34.880]  books or in current days, you have handicaps yourself.
[1:47:34.880 --> 1:47:40.480]  You cannot know psychotic evil unless you are of these people.
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:45.240]  You just have to study how they operate, what their goals are and oppose them.
[1:47:45.240 --> 1:47:49.160]  You don't want to kidnap a child out of their backyard and take them and torture them.
[1:47:49.160 --> 1:47:50.960]  But these people do.
[1:47:50.960 --> 1:47:52.600]  You don't want to launch a war.
[1:47:52.600 --> 1:47:54.120]  You don't want to see cities burn.
[1:47:54.120 --> 1:47:57.080]  You don't want to see poisoned billions of people.
[1:47:57.080 --> 1:48:01.360]  That makes them feel powerful and substantive.
[1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:07.960]  And if you go to the writer of the jungle that then got made into a film, there will
[1:48:07.960 --> 1:48:10.080]  be blood.
[1:48:10.080 --> 1:48:14.080]  They have the character who says, I have a competitiveness in me.
[1:48:14.080 --> 1:48:16.560]  I don't want to see anyone else do well.
[1:48:16.560 --> 1:48:21.200]  Well, I have a competitiveness in me that I don't want to see people dominate and control
[1:48:21.200 --> 1:48:25.560]  me and not have me do well, but I actually see other people doing well and being successful
[1:48:25.560 --> 1:48:28.880]  when they build new things and are innovative as if my wealth has gone up.
[1:48:28.880 --> 1:48:30.680]  I admire them.
[1:48:30.680 --> 1:48:37.880]  I admire great artists and I admire great musicians and I admire great poets and I don't
[1:48:37.880 --> 1:48:39.400]  feel weak when they're strong.
[1:48:39.400 --> 1:48:41.640]  I say, wow, I'm part of this species.
[1:48:41.640 --> 1:48:46.600]  I can interface with this person and commune with the food they've cooked or the clothes
[1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:53.600]  they made or the crops they grew or the guns they made or the things they forged.
[1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:59.360]  I'm connected to these people and the globalists know we're collectivists innately.
[1:48:59.360 --> 1:49:01.080]  We're individuals that are collectivists.
[1:49:01.080 --> 1:49:05.720]  So I'm an individualist, but real individualists create collectives that are based on free
[1:49:05.720 --> 1:49:08.200]  will and what's best for the species.
[1:49:08.200 --> 1:49:12.200]  So they manipulate us and say, oh yeah, sacrifice yourself for us, for the collective.
[1:49:12.200 --> 1:49:16.200]  Do what we say for the better good and then we take the shot, wear the mask, abuse our
[1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:18.320]  children, but we're not doing it for the greater good.
[1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:23.880]  It's a lie that sociopaths, the psychopaths are using our collectivist will against us
[1:49:23.880 --> 1:49:28.640]  and we have to get the average leftist who's not an evil person but deceived to understand
[1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:29.640]  that.
[1:49:29.640 --> 1:49:30.640]  Do you agree with that, Timothy?
[1:49:30.640 --> 1:49:34.120]  Lastly, and how do you think we deprogram the left before it's too late or should we
[1:49:34.120 --> 1:49:38.440]  just move on from them and just build our own civilization then hopefully by example
[1:49:38.440 --> 1:49:40.440]  they will follow?
[1:49:40.440 --> 1:49:47.720]  No, I do agree with that 100%, but I definitely believe that we've spent a lot of time trying
[1:49:47.720 --> 1:49:53.160]  to wake up people that hate us and that just goes to show our good nature and everything
[1:49:53.160 --> 1:49:58.480]  but maybe it's time to build a society that has doors for them to enter when they're
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:04.560]  ready because at this point in time everything, like I said man, everything that they have
[1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:12.120]  constructed is a weapon system against humanity and it's entrenched in their psychology that
[1:50:12.120 --> 1:50:18.360]  we're evil and they're superior to us and I refuse to let them rule the world and these
[1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:19.360]  guys are psychopaths.
[1:50:19.360 --> 1:50:25.320]  I mean they're not even scientists anymore, they've stripped them of their credentials
[1:50:25.320 --> 1:50:26.960]  right here and there.
[1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:32.360]  They're not scientists, they're not philanthropists, they're not influential, they're not celebrities,
[1:50:32.360 --> 1:50:37.840]  they're just monsters, they're just monsters and so we have to build a society that doesn't
[1:50:37.840 --> 1:50:42.600]  have as many monsters in it or this will happen again and again and again.
[1:50:42.600 --> 1:50:46.520]  I agree, I'm going to explain how the math works, this is an oversimplification because
[1:50:46.520 --> 1:50:49.960]  I've had a lot of economists tell me we've got one on next hour and the numbers vary
[1:50:49.960 --> 1:50:59.080]  because it's so fiat as a matter but let's say there is 100 quadrillion in fake currency
[1:50:59.080 --> 1:51:02.960]  and garbage out there and that's a conservative number, 100 quadrillion.
[1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:08.640]  I mean decades ago the world debt was 26 quadrillion last time I had an economist on to break it
[1:51:08.640 --> 1:51:09.640]  down.
[1:51:09.640 --> 1:51:13.160]  Well that's hundreds of times all the real wealth in the world.
[1:51:13.160 --> 1:51:18.440]  So the globalists say oh we've got all this wealth they made up that's digital and then
[1:51:18.440 --> 1:51:23.440]  they see the mass of the public that they've got to quote take care of and because they
[1:51:23.440 --> 1:51:29.080]  feel like they own the world through fraud, well why should they keep paying all these
[1:51:29.080 --> 1:51:30.080]  people?
[1:51:30.080 --> 1:51:32.160]  Why should they keep taking care of them?
[1:51:32.160 --> 1:51:35.640]  And that's why they say you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll eat bugs is they've
[1:51:35.640 --> 1:51:41.600]  stolen the world, they believe digitally, they own it 100 plus times over so we literally
[1:51:41.600 --> 1:51:46.040]  are obsolete and now they're trying to have us accept robots so we are literally obsolete
[1:51:46.040 --> 1:51:48.760]  so they can kill us.
[1:51:48.760 --> 1:51:51.320]  Why would anyone want to go along with that?
[1:51:51.320 --> 1:51:54.440]  Well because they were born into this as you said and don't know, that's why it's our
[1:51:54.440 --> 1:51:59.000]  responsibility to warn people and then if they won't listen that's fine but it is our
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  responsibility.
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:07.240]  It is but I am my brother's keeper 100% and if anything was to happen to you it's going
[1:52:07.240 --> 1:52:12.280]  to happen to me because I experienced it with you.
[1:52:12.280 --> 1:52:18.840]  The establishment, there's no hope for them, there's no reasoning with them and so we just
[1:52:18.840 --> 1:52:20.520]  have to move on.
[1:52:20.520 --> 1:52:25.600]  We just have to literally set down what we've been taught about them and move on their monsters
[1:52:25.600 --> 1:52:31.200]  and I encourage everybody to do this, Klaus Schwab is not, he has no power when you take
[1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:32.200]  it from him.
[1:52:32.200 --> 1:52:36.040]  He had no, Bill Gates doesn't have any power over me whatsoever, he might have power over
[1:52:36.040 --> 1:52:41.360]  somebody else but I took my power back and all of us individually as a collective we
[1:52:41.360 --> 1:52:42.360]  can do that.
[1:52:42.360 --> 1:52:47.680]  I mean, every single country has globalists in them, they all have UN offices, we can
[1:52:47.680 --> 1:52:49.280]  take back our power.
[1:52:49.280 --> 1:52:52.400]  We don't need to be in the United Nations, we don't need to be in the world economic
[1:52:52.400 --> 1:52:59.040]  or it's clutches, if you study the globalists they're actually pathetically weak.
[1:52:59.040 --> 1:53:04.320]  They are, they are, they have, no, they're bumbling idiots with generational wealth and
[1:53:04.320 --> 1:53:12.280]  military systems, that's all they have and their science is backwards, whether they're
[1:53:12.280 --> 1:53:14.960]  inbred or they're just completely soyed out.
[1:53:14.960 --> 1:53:21.880]  I don't care anymore, the brain damage it's taken and so unless we can rehabilitate them
[1:53:21.880 --> 1:53:26.400]  too, I doubt that will happen but what we have to do is we have to fight them because
[1:53:26.400 --> 1:53:33.000]  these kids are not safe, nobody's safe, they're going to sterilize the world and belly laugh
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:38.960]  at the end of the night and we can stop that, me and you, you and I, everybody, we can stop
[1:53:38.960 --> 1:53:42.720]  that, we don't have to sit on our asses, we don't have to be pushed over, we don't have
[1:53:42.720 --> 1:53:45.560]  to go into the woodchippers.
[1:53:45.560 --> 1:53:49.080]  I agree with you, I want to play a paradoxical example here.
[1:53:49.080 --> 1:53:55.560]  We've got Ilhan Omar coming out saying it's wrong to dox, tens of thousands of people
[1:53:55.560 --> 1:53:59.880]  including private women that own private businesses and people threaten to kill them, I agree
[1:53:59.880 --> 1:54:05.920]  with her, it's bullying, it's evil, it's wrong and then we've got the clip of the leftists
[1:54:05.920 --> 1:54:12.840]  that took credit for doxing these folks, I'm going to go ahead and play that clip because
[1:54:12.840 --> 1:54:20.120]  when you see the really anti-human gremlin-like spirit of this guy saying he'll do it, he'll
[1:54:20.120 --> 1:54:27.360]  do it again, he'll do it over and over again, it's this weird spirit that the men who carry
[1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:32.640]  this out engage in and some would call it effeminate, I'm not about to insult women,
[1:54:32.640 --> 1:54:38.440]  this is not effeminate, it's like a toddler throwing a fit, I forget his name, what clip
[1:54:38.440 --> 1:54:41.480]  is he?
[1:54:41.480 --> 1:54:50.080]  This is apparently the person that Hatt gives in go and here he is saying I'm an effing
[1:54:50.080 --> 1:54:55.320]  cyber terrorist and now they're firing people, they're terrorizing them, they're breaking
[1:54:55.320 --> 1:54:59.000]  windows out of their businesses because they supported peaceful truck drivers saying they
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:07.680]  didn't want a deadly shot given to them, here it is.
[1:55:07.680 --> 1:55:14.920]  There's some demonic sheathing, nothing scares me, nothing.
[1:55:14.920 --> 1:55:21.000]  Yes I docked the truckers, I did it, it was me, I had to give, send, go baby and I'd
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:34.680]  do it again, I'd do it a hundred times, I did it, I did it, command me what are you
[1:55:34.680 --> 1:55:39.560]  going to do, what are you going to do to me, huh?
[1:55:39.560 --> 1:55:43.200]  That's Aubrey Cottle, that's who wants to be in control of your social credit score,
[1:55:43.200 --> 1:55:48.000]  writhing like a snake and I'm telling you, the human traffickers, they all act like this,
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:50.520]  put him back on.
[1:55:50.520 --> 1:56:02.840]  I hacked true social, I hacked, go, give, send, go, I don't care.
[1:56:02.840 --> 1:56:09.000]  I'm, you can literally put my name into the news tab on Google and you can find every
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  thing I've got.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:11.960]  That's enough of him, let's do five more minutes with our guest for the Economist joins us
[1:56:11.960 --> 1:56:18.840]  but here's some of the headlines, CNN Dockses, Black Males, WWE, GIFT Creator, remember all
[1:56:18.840 --> 1:56:19.840]  that?
[1:56:19.840 --> 1:56:24.720]  This is all the, and the whole corporate media, a bunch of them jumped on board but Ilhan
[1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:27.360]  Omar said it was wrong.
[1:56:27.360 --> 1:56:31.040]  We've all confined our humanity, I don't care if you're a woman, a man, a Muslim, a Christian,
[1:56:31.040 --> 1:56:34.120]  an agnostic, this has got to stop folks.
[1:56:34.120 --> 1:56:38.200]  I would love to embrace Ilhan Omar, I'd love to have her come out in support of America,
[1:56:38.200 --> 1:56:42.520]  the Second Amendment, thank the US military that saved her and her tribe that was being
[1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:46.960]  exterminated and just to have her convert to Americanism, she can keep her Islam, all
[1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:52.560]  of it, she just needs to join us in freedom and that's good.
[1:56:52.560 --> 1:56:56.160]  We don't want to hate Ilhan Omar, we want to embrace Ilhan Omar, we want to embrace
[1:56:56.160 --> 1:57:00.640]  everybody, we want to win, we want a human future and we can do anything together, we'll
[1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:05.000]  right back with our special guest, people can find Timothy Lassley just by typing in
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  his name, you can find him on Facebook and Twitter until they ban it but it won't matter
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:12.800]  because he's going to be out there in the third dimension taking action and reaching
[1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:15.760]  a lot of people and leading big demonstrations.
[1:57:15.760 --> 1:57:20.920]  We got a, speaking of big, big third hour ahead today, a lot of news we haven't gotten
[1:57:20.920 --> 1:57:23.880]  to, I only scratched the surface but I want to give him some closing comments when we
[1:57:23.880 --> 1:57:27.640]  come back in T-minus two minutes and please don't forget this hour.
[1:57:27.640 --> 1:57:32.880]  My goodness, I almost forgot, five days left to get X3, the good halogen for 50% off and
[1:57:32.880 --> 1:57:38.080]  now back in stock, back in stock ladies and gentlemen, we have several of our best selling
[1:57:38.080 --> 1:57:39.080]  items.
[1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:49.400]  Winner's sign is discounted and so is Brain Force Ultra.
[1:57:49.400 --> 1:57:56.840]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[1:57:56.840 --> 1:58:03.000]  until the populations rebelled, they would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:08.520]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[1:58:08.520 --> 1:58:14.000]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:19.680]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[1:58:19.680 --> 1:58:26.160]  that it is a world government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[1:58:26.160 --> 1:58:27.160]  than ever.
[1:58:27.160 --> 1:58:31.640]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[1:58:31.640 --> 1:58:38.040]  Like Canada where they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other
[1:58:38.040 --> 1:58:40.440]  areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[1:58:40.440 --> 1:58:45.160]  So pray for these folks big time, this is a very serious situation and stay tuned into
[1:58:45.160 --> 1:59:15.080]  the M4Wars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[1:59:15.080 --> 1:59:25.960]  Thank you.
[1:59:25.960 --> 1:59:29.060]  Yes, first of all, health care is really important to a farm.
[1:59:29.060 --> 1:59:30.920]  Arrest out, arrest out, swap.
[1:59:30.920 --> 1:59:32.680]  The vaccine is poison, there's tons of things.
[1:59:32.680 --> 1:59:34.520]  I say just keep it short, keep it concise.
[1:59:34.520 --> 1:59:37.280]  I agree, arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates.
[1:59:37.280 --> 1:59:39.320]  The COVID-vaxx is poison, beautiful.
[1:59:39.320 --> 1:59:41.240]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved
[1:59:41.240 --> 1:59:42.560]  and we could all be effective though.
[1:59:42.560 --> 1:59:43.640]  That's what I'm calling about.
[1:59:43.640 --> 1:59:44.640]  God bless you, Chris.
[1:59:44.640 --> 1:59:46.720]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate
[1:59:46.720 --> 1:59:47.880]  you calling us today.
[1:59:47.880 --> 1:59:48.880]  Thank you so much.
[1:59:52.160 --> 1:59:54.680]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[1:59:54.680 --> 1:59:56.240]  you are the resistance.
[1:59:59.720 --> 2:00:01.960]  Rolling, rolling, rolling.
[2:00:01.960 --> 2:00:04.320]  Rolling, rolling, rolling.
[2:00:04.320 --> 2:00:06.640]  Rolling, rolling, rolling.
[2:00:06.640 --> 2:00:08.400]  Rolling, rolling, rolling.
[2:00:08.400 --> 2:00:11.680]  All right, Timothy.
[2:00:11.680 --> 2:00:14.440]  Lastly, thank you so much, my friend.
[2:00:14.440 --> 2:00:15.560]  I'll have you back again.
[2:00:15.560 --> 2:00:17.480]  I've ever go out to the West Coast,
[2:00:17.480 --> 2:00:19.480]  hopefully to meet with you.
[2:00:19.480 --> 2:00:21.680]  What else do you want to get across the listeners
[2:00:21.680 --> 2:00:25.400]  that are out there in the viewers?
[2:00:25.400 --> 2:00:27.360]  Just don't give up.
[2:00:27.360 --> 2:00:30.240]  Even a small person like myself,
[2:00:30.240 --> 2:00:32.280]  out in the middle of the obscure world,
[2:00:32.280 --> 2:00:33.880]  you have that power.
[2:00:33.880 --> 2:00:36.080]  You just have to just believe in yourself,
[2:00:36.080 --> 2:00:38.400]  believe that what you're doing is worth it,
[2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:39.560]  and just go out and do it.
[2:00:39.560 --> 2:00:41.280]  I mean, that's it.
[2:00:41.280 --> 2:00:42.200]  You just get off your ass.
[2:00:42.200 --> 2:00:44.400]  I was talking with Sabo and I was selling him.
[2:00:44.400 --> 2:00:46.280]  I needed to build a crew and he's like, no, no, no.
[2:00:46.280 --> 2:00:47.000]  You don't need a crew.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:49.640]  You just need to look out why you do all of the work.
[2:00:49.640 --> 2:00:52.600]  So that's basically what you need to be doing.
[2:00:52.600 --> 2:00:55.920]  We have a lot of work to do and the time is now.
[2:00:55.920 --> 2:00:57.080]  We have the momentum.
[2:00:57.080 --> 2:00:59.280]  The world is looking at us.
[2:00:59.280 --> 2:01:00.840]  They know that we're right.
[2:01:00.840 --> 2:01:02.840]  And now they're making a decision
[2:01:02.840 --> 2:01:05.680]  whether they should side with the normalcy bias
[2:01:05.680 --> 2:01:08.080]  or they should go into the future with us.
[2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:09.680]  And we can take them over the horizon
[2:01:09.680 --> 2:01:11.680]  and I'm so excited to do it.
[2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:14.600]  We just have to make Bill Gates and Fauci
[2:01:14.600 --> 2:01:16.000]  and all the eugenicists accountable
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:18.440]  so that we never have to worry about wasting our time
[2:01:18.440 --> 2:01:21.560]  and resources on this.
[2:01:21.560 --> 2:01:26.120]  Yeah, you know, Nazism obviously is a failed experiment.
[2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:27.840]  So let's put it to rest.
[2:01:27.840 --> 2:01:31.520]  Let's ash heat the Nazis and move on with humanity.
[2:01:31.520 --> 2:01:32.760]  And by the way, you're totally right.
[2:01:32.760 --> 2:01:34.800]  Everybody calls this a Nazi, that a Nazi.
[2:01:34.800 --> 2:01:36.960]  If you look at Bill Gates and his dad and grandpa
[2:01:36.960 --> 2:01:38.040]  and all these groups,
[2:01:38.040 --> 2:01:40.640]  they're the groups that created the Nazis.
[2:01:40.640 --> 2:01:42.480]  I mean, it's so it's beyond the Nazis.
[2:01:42.480 --> 2:01:45.720]  This is literally who people think the Nazis are.
[2:01:45.720 --> 2:01:48.800]  Absolutely, and I know I'm gonna point my fingers.
[2:01:48.800 --> 2:01:50.120]  I'm not afraid of them.
[2:01:50.120 --> 2:01:52.240]  Don't be afraid of what they can do to you.
[2:01:52.240 --> 2:01:55.160]  Be afraid of what they'll do if you don't oppose them.
[2:01:55.160 --> 2:01:58.320]  And so that's it, just listen to Alex.
[2:01:58.320 --> 2:02:02.320]  Alex Jones is basically 100% correct all the time.
[2:02:02.320 --> 2:02:06.320]  And I'm putting your words into effect in real time
[2:02:06.320 --> 2:02:07.520]  out in the 3D world, brother.
[2:02:07.520 --> 2:02:09.360]  You're putting so much fire in my soul
[2:02:09.360 --> 2:02:10.760]  and I really appreciate it.
[2:02:10.760 --> 2:02:14.280]  We are on that wavelength, that transmission of God.
[2:02:14.280 --> 2:02:18.360]  And I, dude, we, at the end of this,
[2:02:18.360 --> 2:02:21.160]  you deserve a plaza of statues.
[2:02:21.160 --> 2:02:22.480]  Well, I don't want those.
[2:02:22.480 --> 2:02:24.400]  I just want our children to be together in the future.
[2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:27.280]  But the point is, brother, we're gonna win this.
[2:02:28.280 --> 2:02:29.160]  And you're right.
[2:02:29.160 --> 2:02:30.880]  We're gonna get past this evil together.
[2:02:30.880 --> 2:02:32.720]  There'll be other hurdles we have to face,
[2:02:32.720 --> 2:02:34.920]  but this evil will be defeated.
[2:02:34.920 --> 2:02:39.120]  And definitely their whole system's falling apart right now.
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:41.720]  My big concern is what do you think they're gonna pull next?
[2:02:41.720 --> 2:02:43.880]  I mean, Biden's now says the right thing.
[2:02:43.880 --> 2:02:45.040]  He says the Russians are gonna hit us
[2:02:45.040 --> 2:02:47.720]  with a cyber attack and turn the lights off.
[2:02:47.720 --> 2:02:50.560]  I mean, that's easy to predict, he'd say that next.
[2:02:52.240 --> 2:02:54.400]  I don't think they'll do the lights off thing
[2:02:54.400 --> 2:02:56.320]  because all of the power plants,
[2:02:56.320 --> 2:02:58.160]  the new power plants are tied to the electric grid
[2:02:58.160 --> 2:03:00.280]  and we don't really have that much of a fuse
[2:03:00.280 --> 2:03:02.160]  if those things go off, like you said.
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:05.360]  I think they're gonna try to do more scam demics.
[2:03:05.360 --> 2:03:06.440]  They're gonna, like the monkeys,
[2:03:06.440 --> 2:03:10.240]  they're gonna try to see how traumatized we are.
[2:03:10.240 --> 2:03:13.440]  And a large portion of the population is severely traumatized.
[2:03:13.440 --> 2:03:14.520]  So it might have some effect,
[2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:16.440]  but we have to close the labs.
[2:03:16.440 --> 2:03:18.920]  We have to get these quote-unquote authority figures,
[2:03:18.920 --> 2:03:22.120]  these politicians, we have to get them to close the labs.
[2:03:22.120 --> 2:03:24.880]  We don't need any, I mean, without these labs
[2:03:24.880 --> 2:03:29.080]  in operation, they basically don't have that much weight.
[2:03:29.080 --> 2:03:32.120]  Nobody's gonna nuke, they're not gonna nuke us.
[2:03:32.120 --> 2:03:34.240]  I don't think that they're gonna set forth any nukes.
[2:03:34.240 --> 2:03:35.080]  I think they've figured out-
[2:03:35.080 --> 2:03:36.320]  That's right, the globalists can't use nukes
[2:03:36.320 --> 2:03:37.520]  because that might kill them.
[2:03:37.520 --> 2:03:39.480]  They're gonna keep creating labs and claim its leaks.
[2:03:39.480 --> 2:03:41.040]  We, like Rand Paul says,
[2:03:41.040 --> 2:03:42.840]  we've got to shut down the weapon labs.
[2:03:42.840 --> 2:03:44.080]  I totally agree with you.
[2:03:45.240 --> 2:03:46.080]  Absolutely.
[2:03:46.080 --> 2:03:48.200]  I mean, Hillary Clinton's afraid of the fallout.
[2:03:48.200 --> 2:03:49.400]  So she put that in her email.
[2:03:49.400 --> 2:03:51.240]  So they're not gonna nuke everybody.
[2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:53.240]  What they will do is they will poison us
[2:03:53.240 --> 2:03:54.560]  either soft-kill weapons,
[2:03:54.560 --> 2:03:56.680]  or maybe they'll just save the hell with it
[2:03:56.680 --> 2:03:58.240]  and load up a couple planes.
[2:03:58.240 --> 2:04:02.560]  But in the meantime, we can be building a resistance
[2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:05.760]  that changes the paradigm in the infrastructure.
[2:04:05.760 --> 2:04:07.320]  We need attorneys.
[2:04:07.320 --> 2:04:10.120]  We need the state attorneys to prosecute gates.
[2:04:10.120 --> 2:04:13.760]  We need the floor, why is DeSantis not on top of this?
[2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:15.720]  We need at least one state to come forth
[2:04:15.720 --> 2:04:17.200]  and lead humanity out of this.
[2:04:17.200 --> 2:04:18.040]  And so-
[2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:18.880]  That's right, the first group,
[2:04:18.880 --> 2:04:21.000]  whether it's Bolsonaro in Brazil or who knows,
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:23.400]  or maybe some of the folks in Eastern Europe,
[2:04:23.400 --> 2:04:25.840]  to file indictments for Nuremberg too,
[2:04:25.840 --> 2:04:27.240]  the house of cards is already falling.
[2:04:27.240 --> 2:04:28.360]  That will accelerate it.
[2:04:28.360 --> 2:04:30.160]  All right, thank you so much, Timothy.
[2:04:30.160 --> 2:04:31.840]  Lastly, we really appreciate your brother
[2:04:31.840 --> 2:04:33.160]  will talk to you again soon.
[2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:35.840]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:04:35.840 --> 2:04:37.360]  All right, that was an amazing interview.
[2:04:37.360 --> 2:04:40.920]  Edward Dowd is an ex-Wall Street professional,
[2:04:40.920 --> 2:04:45.360]  worked at HSBC, Donaldson, Lufkin, BlackRock, you name it.
[2:04:45.360 --> 2:04:48.200]  He is about to expose what's really going on
[2:04:48.200 --> 2:04:49.200]  with the global economy
[2:04:49.200 --> 2:04:51.280]  and what you can expect to happen next.
[2:04:51.280 --> 2:04:53.000]  That is in 60 seconds,
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:55.720]  here in the third hour of the Alex Jones show.
[2:04:59.880 --> 2:05:04.280]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock.
[2:05:04.280 --> 2:05:05.120]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[2:05:05.120 --> 2:05:07.080]  just like our information is game changing,
[2:05:07.080 --> 2:05:08.440]  our products are game changing,
[2:05:08.440 --> 2:05:11.800]  and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[2:05:11.800 --> 2:05:13.640]  It's not the soil anymore.
[2:05:13.640 --> 2:05:15.720]  Most of the ocean is contaminated,
[2:05:15.720 --> 2:05:18.560]  but when you get high-quality tri-iodine,
[2:05:18.560 --> 2:05:21.080]  all three of the healthy types together,
[2:05:21.080 --> 2:05:24.520]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido,
[2:05:24.520 --> 2:05:26.200]  but most importantly, your immune system.
[2:05:26.200 --> 2:05:30.560]  So, X3, the only tri-iodine on the market,
[2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:33.520]  highest grade, is now exclusively available again
[2:05:33.520 --> 2:05:36.360]  at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[2:05:36.360 --> 2:05:39.120]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine,
[2:05:39.120 --> 2:05:40.040]  and what it does for your body,
[2:05:40.040 --> 2:05:41.880]  it takes about two weeks to get it on average,
[2:05:41.880 --> 2:05:44.480]  you really need to experience X3.
[2:05:44.480 --> 2:05:45.960]  Those of you that have tried it and used it,
[2:05:45.960 --> 2:05:47.320]  I know you're gonna be reordering it,
[2:05:47.320 --> 2:05:49.480]  but particularly those that haven't ever tried the product,
[2:05:49.480 --> 2:05:52.600]  you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body,
[2:05:52.600 --> 2:05:54.480]  it's the good halogen, not the bad halogen,
[2:05:54.480 --> 2:05:57.080]  and it funds the info war, a true 360 win.
[2:05:57.080 --> 2:06:00.320]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off.
[2:06:02.160 --> 2:06:05.320]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[2:06:05.320 --> 2:06:07.900]  It is, the Alex Jones Show.
[2:06:09.520 --> 2:06:13.040]  I hear people talking bad about the way
[2:06:13.040 --> 2:06:15.800]  we have to live here in this country.
[2:06:17.720 --> 2:06:20.920]  Harping on wars, we fight and griping
[2:06:20.920 --> 2:06:23.280]  about the way things are for baby.
[2:06:25.120 --> 2:06:27.520]  And I don't mind him switching sides
[2:06:27.520 --> 2:06:29.640]  and standing up for things.
[2:06:29.640 --> 2:06:33.600]  Well, I've been following Edward Dowd for a long time.
[2:06:33.600 --> 2:06:35.680]  He's a former Wall Street professional.
[2:06:35.680 --> 2:06:39.760]  You can say a BlackRock insider, HSBC, you name it.
[2:06:39.760 --> 2:06:41.280]  And I've read a lot of his work
[2:06:41.280 --> 2:06:43.680]  and seen a lot of his predictions come true.
[2:06:43.680 --> 2:06:46.280]  He's worked all over Wall Street, the sell side,
[2:06:46.280 --> 2:06:48.040]  the buy side, expert in fixed income,
[2:06:48.040 --> 2:06:49.680]  equities, capital markets.
[2:06:49.680 --> 2:06:51.840]  He's currently trying to start a hedge fund
[2:06:51.840 --> 2:06:53.760]  and got a lot of other stuff going on.
[2:06:53.760 --> 2:06:56.120]  And he's here to talk about the Pfizer fraud,
[2:06:56.120 --> 2:06:58.600]  the VAERS database, insurance companies,
[2:06:58.600 --> 2:07:01.600]  saying increased deaths of 40%, the DOD league,
[2:07:01.600 --> 2:07:04.440]  the vaccination program, and so much more.
[2:07:04.440 --> 2:07:07.440]  We've got the Moderna stock plunging
[2:07:07.440 --> 2:07:09.040]  all this other craziness.
[2:07:09.040 --> 2:07:11.040]  So Edward Dowd, thank you so much for joining us.
[2:07:11.040 --> 2:07:11.920]  Great to have you here.
[2:07:11.920 --> 2:07:13.440]  Where should we start today?
[2:07:14.360 --> 2:07:16.560]  I'd like to start with what's going on with Pfizer
[2:07:16.560 --> 2:07:20.600]  because if people wake up to the fact that it's fraud,
[2:07:20.600 --> 2:07:23.840]  we can end the vaccine programs right away.
[2:07:23.840 --> 2:07:27.280]  And that'll be a good start to ending this nonsense
[2:07:27.280 --> 2:07:29.600]  and madness that's going on across the globe.
[2:07:29.600 --> 2:07:31.000]  So let me start there.
[2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:32.360]  What would you like to know first?
[2:07:32.360 --> 2:07:33.760]  No, you're the expert on this.
[2:07:33.760 --> 2:07:35.120]  And I know you've been predicting a lot of this.
[2:07:35.120 --> 2:07:35.960]  I've seen your writings.
[2:07:35.960 --> 2:07:36.800]  It's now happening.
[2:07:36.800 --> 2:07:37.840]  We see Moderna going down.
[2:07:37.840 --> 2:07:41.520]  We see Pfizer putting out stuff to their shareholders
[2:07:41.520 --> 2:07:43.520]  saying get ready for bad clinical data to come out.
[2:07:43.520 --> 2:07:44.440]  They try to suppress.
[2:07:44.440 --> 2:07:46.960]  I mean, you're laid out for us.
[2:07:46.960 --> 2:07:51.960]  All right, so the CDC and the FDA and Pfizer together
[2:07:56.040 --> 2:07:59.800]  are now trying to prevent the clinical trial data
[2:07:59.800 --> 2:08:03.120]  from the first initial vaccines that launched in January.
[2:08:04.280 --> 2:08:06.320]  And so for me, when I heard that,
[2:08:06.320 --> 2:08:08.680]  I immediately thought that's fraud.
[2:08:08.680 --> 2:08:10.440]  You do not hide data from the public
[2:08:10.440 --> 2:08:12.240]  unless you've committed fraud.
[2:08:12.240 --> 2:08:17.240]  And we saw all the deaths and the disability going on.
[2:08:17.240 --> 2:08:21.040]  So we knew that this was a coverup of crimes.
[2:08:21.040 --> 2:08:22.320]  Once I went public with that
[2:08:22.320 --> 2:08:24.600]  and appeared on the Steve Bannon show,
[2:08:24.600 --> 2:08:28.040]  Brooke Jackson, the Ventavia whistleblower
[2:08:28.040 --> 2:08:31.560]  who was overseeing some of the clinical trials
[2:08:31.560 --> 2:08:34.720]  back in September of 2020 reached out to me
[2:08:34.720 --> 2:08:38.560]  and I did a podcast with her on the Thomas Paine podcast.
[2:08:38.560 --> 2:08:42.560]  And it's become clear to me, the clinical data is fraud.
[2:08:42.560 --> 2:08:47.080]  And interestingly enough, since that podcast went out
[2:08:47.080 --> 2:08:50.040]  and the news is kind of floating around Wall Street
[2:08:50.040 --> 2:08:52.440]  that the whole clinical trial may be fraudulent,
[2:08:52.440 --> 2:08:55.200]  which I believe it is 100% in my opinion.
[2:08:55.200 --> 2:08:59.440]  No one from the mainstream media has reached out to her.
[2:08:59.440 --> 2:09:01.760]  I'm gonna break some news today.
[2:09:01.760 --> 2:09:03.680]  She's been contacted by Wall Street.
[2:09:04.800 --> 2:09:08.960]  Investment Bank wants to get her on a call
[2:09:08.960 --> 2:09:13.920]  with institutional investors, pension funds, hedge funds.
[2:09:13.920 --> 2:09:16.120]  And they also wanted to go to a perhaps
[2:09:16.120 --> 2:09:20.200]  a live conference they hold to speak to 4,000 people.
[2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:22.480]  So let me make a point here.
[2:09:22.480 --> 2:09:24.680]  The mainstream media may ignore this.
[2:09:24.680 --> 2:09:26.080]  Wall Street is not.
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:30.080]  Wall Street is going and it's already started.
[2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:33.800]  Moderna stock is down 70% from its high.
[2:09:33.800 --> 2:09:36.160]  Pfizer's down 19%.
[2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:38.520]  So we don't need the mainstream media
[2:09:38.520 --> 2:09:43.360]  because my goal has been to get these stocks
[2:09:43.360 --> 2:09:44.960]  to start underperforming.
[2:09:44.960 --> 2:09:46.080]  And they started underperforming
[2:09:46.080 --> 2:09:48.840]  before I started to get more notoriety.
[2:09:48.840 --> 2:09:50.120]  So it's not due to me.
[2:09:50.120 --> 2:09:53.400]  People smarter than me were already figuring this out.
[2:09:53.400 --> 2:09:55.640]  And I want you to know Wall Street's rallying to this.
[2:09:55.640 --> 2:09:58.680]  I'm getting lots of increase from former colleagues
[2:09:58.680 --> 2:10:00.160]  and people want to know what's going on.
[2:10:00.160 --> 2:10:03.640]  So nothing will convince a sleeping public
[2:10:03.640 --> 2:10:08.640]  or those not awake yet than red stocks or collapsing stocks.
[2:10:09.080 --> 2:10:11.160]  Money talks, BS walks.
[2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:13.560]  So this is my goal is to wake up the country
[2:10:13.560 --> 2:10:18.000]  through people seeing that there's something going on
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:20.520]  and Wall Street is awake.
[2:10:20.520 --> 2:10:21.360]  That's amazing.
[2:10:21.360 --> 2:10:23.120]  And you know, Edward, I saw you a week and a half ago
[2:10:23.120 --> 2:10:25.360]  or whenever it was on Steve Vannon.
[2:10:25.360 --> 2:10:26.840]  And the news was so big
[2:10:26.840 --> 2:10:28.840]  because I separately had researched it
[2:10:28.840 --> 2:10:30.080]  and knew what you were saying was accurate.
[2:10:30.080 --> 2:10:32.560]  I didn't have the level of understanding you did.
[2:10:32.560 --> 2:10:34.360]  And then immediately started to see the actions.
[2:10:34.360 --> 2:10:36.760]  I think it's fair to say you telling the truth
[2:10:36.760 --> 2:10:40.000]  and bringing this out has contributed a lot
[2:10:40.960 --> 2:10:43.720]  to the beginning of the falling of this house of cards.
[2:10:43.720 --> 2:10:46.960]  I think it's fair to say when you've got Moderna down 70%
[2:10:46.960 --> 2:10:49.360]  and you've got Pfizer down 13% or whatever,
[2:10:49.360 --> 2:10:52.720]  this is seismic and they're starting to run scared.
[2:10:52.720 --> 2:10:55.520]  This is a historic moment we're in right now.
[2:10:56.440 --> 2:10:57.280]  Absolutely.
[2:10:57.280 --> 2:11:00.960]  You know, I also want to say this hallucination nationally,
[2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:03.720]  the propaganda and the people who got the jabs.
[2:11:03.720 --> 2:11:05.720]  There's lots of people who got these jabs
[2:11:06.840 --> 2:11:09.280]  that didn't understand what was going on.
[2:11:09.280 --> 2:11:11.840]  And a lot of them are in the investment world.
[2:11:11.840 --> 2:11:16.120]  A lot of them are smart people, they were duped to.
[2:11:16.120 --> 2:11:18.760]  And some of these people that got the jab
[2:11:18.760 --> 2:11:20.720]  are doing the work on shorting these stocks
[2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:22.680]  because you know, you can guess
[2:11:22.680 --> 2:11:24.200]  they're mad as hell.
[2:11:24.200 --> 2:11:28.600]  And you've awakened the sleeping giant known as Wall Street
[2:11:28.600 --> 2:11:30.560]  and Wall Street is on the move.
[2:11:30.560 --> 2:11:33.000]  The smart money's moving first.
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:34.960]  As always, there's lead steers.
[2:11:36.080 --> 2:11:40.000]  Nothing gets going faster than a red momentum
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:41.080]  down trending stock.
[2:11:41.080 --> 2:11:46.080]  So I think those of you who still think nothing's going on,
[2:11:46.240 --> 2:11:49.760]  you don't want to be what I call the bag holder.
[2:11:49.760 --> 2:11:52.720]  You don't want to be the guy taking the fourth jab booster
[2:11:52.720 --> 2:11:55.560]  and holding these stocks down to Moderna's going to zero.
[2:11:55.560 --> 2:11:57.920]  And I think Pfizer eventually goes sub $10
[2:11:57.920 --> 2:11:59.960]  once the lawsuits come out.
[2:11:59.960 --> 2:12:02.520]  Now, there's a lot of questions about the indemnity
[2:12:02.520 --> 2:12:03.760]  that they have.
[2:12:03.760 --> 2:12:07.640]  Well, if fraud can be proven, which I think the case is,
[2:12:07.640 --> 2:12:12.640]  you know, 100%, then fraud eviscerates all contracts.
[2:12:13.240 --> 2:12:16.120]  There's multiple case law about this.
[2:12:16.120 --> 2:12:19.560]  When one party enters into a contract, say a government,
[2:12:19.560 --> 2:12:24.560]  and fraud was occurring when they entered into that contract.
[2:12:25.720 --> 2:12:27.360]  The other party didn't know that.
[2:12:27.360 --> 2:12:29.200]  The contract is void enough.
[2:12:29.200 --> 2:12:31.760]  So there's no indemnity if this can be proven
[2:12:31.760 --> 2:12:32.960]  and I think it will be.
[2:12:34.120 --> 2:12:37.640]  Well, please continue because, again,
[2:12:38.520 --> 2:12:39.840]  I saw your big man interview.
[2:12:39.840 --> 2:12:40.920]  I was already familiar with some of your work.
[2:12:40.920 --> 2:12:42.560]  I said, please get him one of my producers.
[2:12:42.560 --> 2:12:44.360]  And now since that we can have everything you said
[2:12:44.360 --> 2:12:47.720]  started to come true, I mean, I'm just blown away by this.
[2:12:47.720 --> 2:12:50.800]  And as a layperson, that's what I thought was happening
[2:12:50.800 --> 2:12:53.840]  was these moves against Moderna and now Pfizer
[2:12:53.840 --> 2:12:57.000]  seemed like a lot of powerful people in Wall Street
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:12:57.840]  were going against it.
[2:12:57.840 --> 2:13:00.880]  And then to see the top executives,
[2:13:00.880 --> 2:13:02.560]  not just the head of Moderna,
[2:13:02.560 --> 2:13:04.280]  but others deleting their accounts,
[2:13:04.280 --> 2:13:06.440]  this shows me that it wasn't a pump and dump,
[2:13:06.440 --> 2:13:09.240]  but it shows a true real panic going on,
[2:13:09.240 --> 2:13:11.680]  which shows me this is a seismic event.
[2:13:12.880 --> 2:13:17.440]  Yeah, the Moderna is clearly in a downtrend.
[2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:19.120]  People are dumping it.
[2:13:19.120 --> 2:13:22.080]  I think it's a zero once the fraud comes out.
[2:13:22.080 --> 2:13:23.600]  They're a single product company.
[2:13:23.600 --> 2:13:26.320]  Pfizer has a lot of other products,
[2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:28.600]  but they're gonna get a lot of lawsuits.
[2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:31.800]  And so that's gonna cause their stock, in my opinion,
[2:13:31.800 --> 2:13:35.040]  humble opinion, to go sub $10 at some point.
[2:13:35.040 --> 2:13:37.720]  So Wall Street is waking up.
[2:13:37.720 --> 2:13:38.600]  Not everyone's awake.
[2:13:38.600 --> 2:13:42.560]  There's still a lot of what I call asymmetric information,
[2:13:42.560 --> 2:13:44.160]  meaning some people are figuring it out
[2:13:44.160 --> 2:13:46.160]  and others are still unaware
[2:13:46.160 --> 2:13:50.000]  and asking questions why these stocks are underperformant.
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:51.680]  I would like to highlight the mainstream media
[2:13:51.680 --> 2:13:55.320]  seems puzzled as to why these stocks are going down.
[2:13:56.360 --> 2:13:57.960]  And I'd like to alert the mainstream media
[2:13:57.960 --> 2:14:00.840]  they're going down because of the vaccine deaths
[2:14:00.840 --> 2:14:03.160]  and injuries that are starting to show up
[2:14:03.160 --> 2:14:05.080]  in insurance company reports
[2:14:05.080 --> 2:14:07.600]  and funeral home company reports.
[2:14:07.600 --> 2:14:10.160]  Funeral home companies are growth stocks.
[2:14:10.160 --> 2:14:14.440]  They had a great year in 2021 compared to 2020.
[2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:16.760]  They outperformed the S&P 500.
[2:14:16.760 --> 2:14:21.760]  The peer group of funeral home stocks was up 40 plus percent.
[2:14:21.960 --> 2:14:23.880]  The S&P was up 26.
[2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:27.760]  And they started accelerating price-wise in 2021
[2:14:27.760 --> 2:14:31.640]  during the rollout of the vaccines, okay?
[2:14:31.640 --> 2:14:34.200]  So you don't need to be a rocket scientist
[2:14:34.200 --> 2:14:35.440]  to connect the dots here.
[2:14:37.440 --> 2:14:39.480]  I totally agree and I wanna give you the floor
[2:14:39.480 --> 2:14:41.360]  when we come back in the next 40 minutes
[2:14:41.360 --> 2:14:42.520]  to really lay this out.
[2:14:42.520 --> 2:14:43.760]  Again, I don't know whether I would call
[2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:47.080]  Edward Dowett a whistleblower, a Wall Street insider.
[2:14:47.080 --> 2:14:48.840]  That's why my intro, I wanted to build it up
[2:14:48.840 --> 2:14:50.280]  because it's so huge what's happening.
[2:14:50.280 --> 2:14:52.680]  What's the best definition for what you're doing?
[2:14:52.680 --> 2:14:54.480]  Because I know our listeners are gonna ask me,
[2:14:54.480 --> 2:14:57.320]  well, what is this, a whistleblower, an insider,
[2:14:57.320 --> 2:15:00.160]  a forecaster, what would you call yourself?
[2:15:00.160 --> 2:15:05.120]  Well, Alex, my whole career,
[2:15:05.120 --> 2:15:08.040]  my job was to be a head of the news and be a lead steer.
[2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:09.760]  And we didn't wait for the Wall Street Journal.
[2:15:09.760 --> 2:15:12.120]  So you're a futurist, you're a trendsetter.
[2:15:12.120 --> 2:15:15.480]  Well, that's what we call stock picking.
[2:15:15.480 --> 2:15:18.880]  And what's funny is when I take my stock picking skills
[2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:20.440]  outside of the realm of stock picking,
[2:15:20.440 --> 2:15:22.160]  I'm called a conspiracy theorist.
[2:15:23.680 --> 2:15:27.320]  So basically, you're a stock picker, Alex,
[2:15:27.320 --> 2:15:29.120]  you don't even know that, but you are.
[2:15:29.120 --> 2:15:31.920]  That's what we do for, that's what I did my whole career
[2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:34.880]  was to connect the dots with 30% of the available
[2:15:34.880 --> 2:15:38.600]  information and bet capital on my predictions.
[2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:42.640]  So this is an investment thesis that I'm making.
[2:15:42.640 --> 2:15:43.920]  I can say that it's fraud
[2:15:43.920 --> 2:15:46.040]  because I'm talking to investors.
[2:15:46.040 --> 2:15:47.360]  I don't need to prove it.
[2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:48.800]  And you said this a week and a half ago,
[2:15:48.800 --> 2:15:50.360]  and it's all going down just like you said,
[2:15:50.360 --> 2:15:51.360]  that's what's credible.
[2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:52.520]  Edward Dowd, stay right there,
[2:15:52.520 --> 2:15:53.480]  we'll be back in just a few minutes.
[2:15:53.480 --> 2:15:54.680]  Thank you for joining us.
[2:15:58.520 --> 2:16:00.160]  Mike in California, thanks for calling.
[2:16:00.160 --> 2:16:02.120]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree,
[2:16:02.120 --> 2:16:04.280]  calling this gain of function research.
[2:16:04.280 --> 2:16:07.480]  Now, if you read the actual 2014 legislation,
[2:16:07.480 --> 2:16:09.400]  the U.S. government gain of function,
[2:16:09.400 --> 2:16:12.520]  deliberative process and research funding pause
[2:16:12.520 --> 2:16:14.800]  on selected gain of function research
[2:16:14.800 --> 2:16:17.160]  involving influenza, MERS, and SARS viruses.
[2:16:17.160 --> 2:16:19.640]  There's nothing about SARS-like viruses.
[2:16:19.640 --> 2:16:21.440]  And it's a research funding pause.
[2:16:21.440 --> 2:16:23.640]  It's not a stop, it's not a prohibition.
[2:16:23.640 --> 2:16:25.600]  It's when you come to a four-way intersection,
[2:16:25.600 --> 2:16:26.960]  there's the stops sign, you stop,
[2:16:26.960 --> 2:16:28.960]  you look both ways, and then you proceed.
[2:16:28.960 --> 2:16:31.800]  And so it's also, it doesn't pause all gain of function,
[2:16:31.800 --> 2:16:33.560]  just selected gain of function.
[2:16:33.560 --> 2:16:35.200]  But they'll argue that this is actually
[2:16:35.200 --> 2:16:38.080]  characterization and qualification research.
[2:16:38.080 --> 2:16:40.960]  So Rand and the others, maybe Fauci was right,
[2:16:40.960 --> 2:16:42.600]  they don't quite know what they're talking about,
[2:16:42.600 --> 2:16:43.920]  calling it gain of function.
[2:16:43.920 --> 2:16:45.400]  That's why he didn't perjure himself,
[2:16:45.400 --> 2:16:46.920]  that's why he hasn't been arrested.
[2:16:46.920 --> 2:16:49.640]  Because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms
[2:16:49.640 --> 2:16:51.160]  that mimic what the viruses do.
[2:16:51.160 --> 2:16:54.320]  But in the main definition, it's still a gain of function.
[2:16:54.320 --> 2:16:55.400]  They're making something deadly
[2:16:55.400 --> 2:16:56.800]  that spreads more easily to hurt people.
[2:16:56.800 --> 2:16:58.280]  Thank you, Mike, we love you.

[2:17:58.360 --> 2:17:59.600]  A riotous mob.
[2:17:59.600 --> 2:18:01.760]  Whether they were present that day
[2:18:01.760 --> 2:18:03.960]  or were otherwise criminally responsible
[2:18:03.960 --> 2:18:05.440]  for the assault on our democracy.
[2:18:05.440 --> 2:18:06.560]  It's surrections.
[2:18:06.560 --> 2:18:10.000]  We will follow the facts wherever they lead.
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:11.200]  Domestic terrorists.
[2:18:12.960 --> 2:18:15.400]  The day's independent media are numbered.
[2:18:15.400 --> 2:18:18.520]  The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[2:18:18.520 --> 2:18:21.400]  They are now deep banking us behind the scenes.
[2:18:21.400 --> 2:18:25.160]  They wanna bankrupt us and make us go away quietly
[2:18:25.160 --> 2:18:27.360]  with practically half the population
[2:18:27.360 --> 2:18:30.320]  wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps.
[2:18:30.320 --> 2:18:33.640]  The traders know they can shut us down by force.
[2:18:33.640 --> 2:18:36.760]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[2:18:36.760 --> 2:18:38.320]  So be it.
[2:18:38.320 --> 2:18:40.720]  Make them silence us by force.
[2:18:40.720 --> 2:18:43.720]  This is the final battle of the information war.

[2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:04.000]  that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:07.800]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government
[2:19:07.800 --> 2:19:09.880]  are stealing all of your data
[2:19:09.880 --> 2:19:12.600]  and creating a map and a database of where you go
[2:19:12.600 --> 2:19:13.560]  and what you do.
[2:19:13.560 --> 2:19:16.200]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover,
[2:19:16.200 --> 2:19:18.000]  they can shut you down.
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:19.880]  Protecting your privacy.

[2:19:25.960 --> 2:19:28.400]  Protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.

[2:20:23.640 --> 2:20:27.520]  Edward Dowd is our guest.
[2:20:27.520 --> 2:20:29.200]  He's worked for BlackRock.
[2:20:29.200 --> 2:20:31.000]  He's worked for HSBC.
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:33.680]  You name it, as an analyst and stock picker.
[2:20:33.680 --> 2:20:36.320]  And of course, he went on, we can have a go or so,
[2:20:36.320 --> 2:20:40.040]  on Steve Bannon's show and just laid out his predictions
[2:20:40.040 --> 2:20:43.320]  about what was about to unfold and what was about to happen.
[2:20:43.320 --> 2:20:45.040]  And his predictions have come true.
[2:20:45.040 --> 2:20:48.120]  We've seen a 70% chance of getting a chance
[2:20:48.120 --> 2:20:51.120]  of getting a chance of getting a chance of getting a chance
[2:20:51.120 --> 2:20:53.600]  of getting a chance of getting a chance of getting a chance
[2:20:53.600 --> 2:20:54.800]  of getting it offered.
[2:20:54.800 --> 2:20:58.240]  So we've seen a 70% drop in Moderna.
[2:20:58.240 --> 2:21:01.560]  We've seen a 13% drop or so in Pfizer.
[2:21:01.560 --> 2:21:03.480]  We're seeing a major government say,
[2:21:03.480 --> 2:21:05.580]  don't give the shots to children.
[2:21:05.580 --> 2:21:08.120]  We're seeing even UN officials come out against it.
[2:21:08.120 --> 2:21:10.680]  A huge event is taking place.
[2:21:10.680 --> 2:21:12.800]  I've got an article we're printing right now.
[2:21:12.800 --> 2:21:14.800]  And we'll cover it next segment.
[2:21:14.800 --> 2:21:16.920]  The government of Scotland will no longer release
[2:21:16.920 --> 2:21:20.060]  death data saying it's being misrepresented
[2:21:20.060 --> 2:21:23.480]  by anti-vaxers because the death numbers are way up.
[2:21:23.480 --> 2:21:29.400]  numbers, insurance groups, these death rates rise up to 40% over pre-pandemic levels.
[2:21:29.400 --> 2:21:30.880]  That broke a few weeks ago.
[2:21:30.880 --> 2:21:36.160]  Now other major insurance companies are showing similar or higher numbers.
[2:21:36.160 --> 2:21:41.400]  So again, joining us is Edward Dowd laying all this out as an analyst and where he thinks
[2:21:41.400 --> 2:21:42.400]  it's going next.
[2:21:42.400 --> 2:21:43.400]  Again, thanks for joining us.
[2:21:43.400 --> 2:21:44.400]  Please continue.
[2:21:44.400 --> 2:21:45.400]  Yeah.
[2:21:45.400 --> 2:21:46.560]  Let me just back up.
[2:21:46.560 --> 2:21:52.040]  So the first company to report this was One America in January.
[2:21:52.040 --> 2:21:55.440]  I saw that report and I got it on zero hedge.
[2:21:55.440 --> 2:22:01.040]  I grabbed the Chamber of Commerce video, got it to Dr. Malone, Steve Kersh, and that
[2:22:01.040 --> 2:22:02.720]  started to go viral.
[2:22:02.720 --> 2:22:05.000]  So that was the beginning.
[2:22:05.000 --> 2:22:10.480]  I said, okay, we have one, let's see what the others say, and they reported the first
[2:22:10.480 --> 2:22:11.480]  week of February.
[2:22:11.480 --> 2:22:16.720]  Let me just give you some shocking numbers of what we saw.
[2:22:16.720 --> 2:22:25.400]  Unum, insurance, now I'm comparing Q4 loss ratio or death claims versus the 2019 base
[2:22:25.400 --> 2:22:26.400]  rate.
[2:22:26.400 --> 2:22:34.360]  Unum, plus 36%, Lincoln National, plus 57%, Prudential, plus 41%, Reinsurance Group of
[2:22:34.360 --> 2:22:45.080]  America, plus 21%, Hartford, plus 32%, MetLife, plus 24%, and Aegon, which is a Dutch insurer
[2:22:45.080 --> 2:22:49.520]  saw in their U.S. arm, plus 57% in the fourth quarter.
[2:22:49.520 --> 2:22:55.040]  In the third quarter, they saw a 258% increase in deaths or claims.
[2:22:55.040 --> 2:23:00.280]  We don't know the actual numbers, but it's a shocking number.
[2:23:00.280 --> 2:23:05.200]  And let me just also note one thing that happened in Aegon's quarter.
[2:23:05.200 --> 2:23:10.920]  On the conference call, they were asked about what their expectations for mortality were
[2:23:10.920 --> 2:23:11.920]  in the U.S.
[2:23:11.920 --> 2:23:19.640]  They raised expectations by 300,000 for 2022 over 2021 due to COVID, and what's called
[2:23:19.640 --> 2:23:25.400]  indirect COVID, which I think we know what that's code for.
[2:23:25.400 --> 2:23:28.920]  They also did in the fourth quarter an interest in transaction.
[2:23:28.920 --> 2:23:33.400]  Now this is speculation on my part, but I think it's good speculation.
[2:23:33.400 --> 2:23:41.360]  They did a $1.4 billion re-insurance deal with Wilton re-insurance, or Winston, I can't
[2:23:41.360 --> 2:23:44.440]  remember, Winston or Wilton re-insurance.
[2:23:44.440 --> 2:23:49.160]  And on the conference call, I went into the conference called transcripts, a cell-side
[2:23:49.160 --> 2:23:52.760]  analyst seemed very confused about why they would do the deal.
[2:23:52.760 --> 2:23:57.280]  The economics of the deal looked very unfavorable to Aegon.
[2:23:57.280 --> 2:24:02.960]  I suspect in a year or two, the deal will look very favorable.
[2:24:02.960 --> 2:24:07.880]  And what they were re-insuring were high face amount individual policies.
[2:24:07.880 --> 2:24:12.640]  These are policies from 1 million to 10 million, these big, big policies.
[2:24:12.640 --> 2:24:18.960]  So I think there's an asymmetric information situation going on in the insurance industry
[2:24:18.960 --> 2:24:24.520]  where some people have figured out something's going on and they're offloading their risk.
[2:24:24.520 --> 2:24:27.560]  They're not going to say what it is because they don't want that information to get out
[2:24:27.560 --> 2:24:30.040]  as they unload the risk.
[2:24:30.040 --> 2:24:33.440]  So someone's going to be the bag holder on this in the insurance industry.
[2:24:33.440 --> 2:24:35.240]  So that I find very interesting.
[2:24:35.240 --> 2:24:39.160]  And let me just back up.
[2:24:39.160 --> 2:24:41.000]  I believe this is fraud.
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:47.080]  And unlike other frauds where people lost money like Enron or just other classical frauds
[2:24:47.080 --> 2:24:52.800]  we've seen throughout our financial history, people are dying and being maimed.
[2:24:52.800 --> 2:24:57.360]  This is a fraud that goes beyond the pale.
[2:24:57.360 --> 2:25:01.680]  And we now have three sources of information that something's going on.
[2:25:01.680 --> 2:25:06.520]  We have the VAERS database, which a lot of people like to poo poo.
[2:25:06.520 --> 2:25:10.920]  We now have the DOD leak that Tom Rents got.
[2:25:10.920 --> 2:25:16.720]  And now we have the insurance company results and the funeral home results.
[2:25:16.720 --> 2:25:18.840]  And they're reporting good numbers.
[2:25:18.840 --> 2:25:23.800]  Services Corporation International today or yesterday reported, they had great numbers
[2:25:23.800 --> 2:25:28.480]  and they're looking for continued growth.
[2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:29.480]  They didn't call out COVID.
[2:25:29.480 --> 2:25:30.840]  They didn't call out a vaccine.
[2:25:30.840 --> 2:25:35.200]  But we don't need to think too hard about this.
[2:25:35.200 --> 2:25:40.280]  Death should have gone down in the year that the miracle vaccine was rolled out, not gone
[2:25:40.280 --> 2:25:41.280]  up.
[2:25:41.280 --> 2:25:42.280]  And that's what we're seeing.
[2:25:42.280 --> 2:25:49.120]  So this is the most egregious fraud in the history of the nation and it's global.
[2:25:49.120 --> 2:25:50.120]  I totally agree with you.
[2:25:50.120 --> 2:25:51.720]  The numbers don't lie.
[2:25:51.720 --> 2:25:55.000]  Plus my own anecdotal evidence is people are devastated by these shots.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:59.960]  I don't think this is going the way Bill Gates and BlackRock and some of the kingpins
[2:25:59.960 --> 2:26:05.160]  up at the top like Klaus Schwab thought it would go.
[2:26:05.160 --> 2:26:12.120]  You know, I don't have the information to definitively say any of those people are involved.
[2:26:12.120 --> 2:26:15.360]  But all I know is Pfizer's involved and they committed fraud.
[2:26:15.360 --> 2:26:16.360]  Now I agree with you.
[2:26:16.360 --> 2:26:20.840]  What I'm saying is this is speculated as an American as a man.
[2:26:20.840 --> 2:26:25.360]  How would the system roll something out this disastrous when top scientists a year and
[2:26:25.360 --> 2:26:27.040]  a half ago warned this would happen?
[2:26:27.040 --> 2:26:32.360]  I mean, it's not like they didn't know that spike protein injections do this or that causes
[2:26:32.360 --> 2:26:34.400]  microcarditis and heart attacks.
[2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:38.600]  I mean, that was in CDC documents in October of 2020 before they gave the shots.
[2:26:38.600 --> 2:26:40.440]  Why would you do this?
[2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:46.720]  Well, look, I'm on record speculating and again, this is a thesis.
[2:26:46.720 --> 2:26:48.280]  It's not proven yet.
[2:26:48.280 --> 2:26:55.920]  But I put out a pin tweet on my Twitter, which I couched under the term of a dystopian movie.
[2:26:55.920 --> 2:27:01.800]  And pretty much everything I laid out in May of 2020 came true.
[2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:02.800]  And how did I get there?
[2:27:02.800 --> 2:27:07.480]  Well, you know, a lot of us in the financial world have been wondering when the debt bubble
[2:27:07.480 --> 2:27:12.040]  that we've seen blowing the last several years is going to end.
[2:27:12.040 --> 2:27:15.600]  And when it ends, it's not going to be pretty.
[2:27:15.600 --> 2:27:21.200]  And so when I saw COVID go down and I knew there was a debt bubble that had to end eventually,
[2:27:21.200 --> 2:27:27.000]  I said, well, we can speculate whether it was released on purpose or a convenient excuse.
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:34.440]  But I was able to come up with my pin tweets because if I wanted to cover up the debt crisis,
[2:27:34.440 --> 2:27:37.480]  I would do exactly what I said in my pin tweets.
[2:27:37.480 --> 2:27:43.160]  I thought like a criminal and it wasn't that hard to come up with that because, you know,
[2:27:43.160 --> 2:27:46.640]  if you're going to have a debt crisis and the pensions can't get paid and the social
[2:27:46.640 --> 2:27:50.120]  contract is already broken, most people don't know that yet.
[2:27:50.120 --> 2:27:57.040]  You're going to have to have a system in place to control the riots, limit travel, control
[2:27:57.040 --> 2:27:58.400]  bank accounts.
[2:27:58.400 --> 2:27:59.400]  And here we are.
[2:27:59.400 --> 2:28:05.600]  And we see Trudeau controlling bank accounts under the guise of medical tyranny to help
[2:28:05.600 --> 2:28:12.240]  us because, you know, we're so at risk from a virus that 99.9% of us survived.
[2:28:12.240 --> 2:28:19.240]  So that's speculation on my part, but my tweets are very accurately proven to show that's
[2:28:19.240 --> 2:28:21.360]  what I would do if I was in a criminal case.
[2:28:21.360 --> 2:28:22.360]  That's right.
[2:28:22.360 --> 2:28:24.760]  And we're going to come back in the next longer segment and show those, but your analysis
[2:28:24.760 --> 2:28:25.760]  is mine exactly.
[2:28:25.760 --> 2:28:26.760]  You got it.
[2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:30.180]  The end of a Ponzi scheme, the social contract's broken.
[2:28:30.180 --> 2:28:31.180]  What do you do?
[2:28:31.180 --> 2:28:32.960]  You hit people with a devastating event.
[2:28:32.960 --> 2:28:36.960]  So now the very people that orchestrated the event poses the saviors and then have the
[2:28:36.960 --> 2:28:42.080]  organized collapse, which they pretend to be the saviors of during said collapse.
[2:28:42.080 --> 2:28:46.120]  And that's basically the globalist post-industrial great reset model.
[2:28:46.120 --> 2:28:50.040]  And then the question is how was the great reset going, and I would say not too well.
[2:28:50.040 --> 2:28:51.400]  People now know they're behind it.
[2:28:51.400 --> 2:28:52.400]  This is explosive.
[2:28:52.400 --> 2:28:53.400]  Stay with us.
[2:28:53.400 --> 2:29:03.880]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying,
[2:29:03.880 --> 2:29:07.840]  empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[2:29:07.840 --> 2:29:12.320]  And when it comes to information, boy, is that true today.
[2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:19.440]  We see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation, great reset combine, trying to
[2:29:19.440 --> 2:29:26.000]  collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:32.480]  the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[2:29:32.480 --> 2:29:38.280]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030,
[2:29:38.280 --> 2:29:41.240]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[2:29:41.240 --> 2:29:42.840]  And none of it can succeed.
[2:29:42.840 --> 2:29:48.520]  None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[2:29:48.520 --> 2:29:52.240]  That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[2:29:52.240 --> 2:29:56.440]  And that's why it's hard to share in full war's links and band up at EO Lakes.
[2:29:56.440 --> 2:29:59.320]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[2:29:59.320 --> 2:30:04.720]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[2:30:04.720 --> 2:30:06.760]  a healthier life.
[2:30:06.760 --> 2:30:10.600]  Infowars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system with a supplement
[2:30:10.600 --> 2:30:12.200]  that contains both.
[2:30:12.200 --> 2:30:17.200]  This infowars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[2:30:17.200 --> 2:30:18.800]  from the infowars store.
[2:30:18.800 --> 2:30:23.600]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[2:30:23.600 --> 2:30:26.320]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[2:30:26.320 --> 2:30:31.160]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[2:30:31.160 --> 2:30:35.880]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[2:30:35.880 --> 2:30:36.880]  shown.
[2:30:36.880 --> 2:30:41.160]  If your vitamin C and zinc themselves you probably already know that they play an important
[2:30:41.160 --> 2:30:45.720]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[2:30:45.720 --> 2:30:50.840]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[2:30:50.840 --> 2:30:51.840]  like here in America.
[2:30:51.840 --> 2:30:56.880]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise our
[2:30:56.880 --> 2:30:58.960]  rose hips don't lie.
[2:30:58.960 --> 2:31:00.800]  So I did it.
[2:31:00.800 --> 2:31:02.960]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[2:31:02.960 --> 2:31:07.760]  I've been training probably not as much as I should be but thank goodness for prayer and
[2:31:07.760 --> 2:31:10.760]  thank goodness for infowarsstore.com.
[2:31:10.760 --> 2:31:15.840]  Before I start out on a run I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to
[2:31:15.840 --> 2:31:21.000]  get going you know besides the energy turbo force it is giving me the vitamins I need
[2:31:21.000 --> 2:31:25.840]  like vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids
[2:31:25.840 --> 2:31:30.000]  for sustained energy giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[2:31:30.000 --> 2:31:35.960]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones Sorilis I have bad joints thanks mom.
[2:31:35.960 --> 2:31:40.600]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation
[2:31:40.600 --> 2:31:43.000]  support and extra flexibility.
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:47.560]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[2:31:47.560 --> 2:31:52.280]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon good news turbo force that can
[2:31:52.280 --> 2:31:56.360]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for everyday and Sorilis can keep you
[2:31:56.360 --> 2:31:58.560]  moving and feeling great at any age.
[2:31:58.560 --> 2:32:04.680]  I am a worldly person meaning I like going to ball games I like going to concerts I like
[2:32:04.680 --> 2:32:10.240]  going to play golf I like going out to dinner I like the metropolitan life I like everything
[2:32:10.240 --> 2:32:16.880]  that comes with this but see I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of democrat
[2:32:16.880 --> 2:32:22.040]  run cities get the hell out of major metropolitan areas because unless we change course soon
[2:32:22.040 --> 2:32:26.320]  it's all crashing down is it time to just move out to the woods just time to go get
[2:32:26.320 --> 2:32:30.120]  a piece of property in the woods just get off grid just get the emergency food supplies
[2:32:30.120 --> 2:32:34.320]  just live off the land that's the survival instinct but see the worldly part of me that
[2:32:34.320 --> 2:32:38.960]  still probably the majority part of me says no no no no stay in the city the survival
[2:32:38.960 --> 2:32:42.640]  instinct says get the hell out of anywhere there ever notion that you need to get a vaccine
[2:32:42.640 --> 2:32:48.560]  or a mask that's the that's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience
[2:32:48.560 --> 2:32:53.880]  are facing as well but you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food
[2:32:53.880 --> 2:33:00.960]  supplies and so we have the best ones in info wars store dot com leading a frontal assault
[2:33:00.960 --> 2:33:14.320]  on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones leading a frontal assault on the lies
[2:33:14.320 --> 2:33:35.560]  of the new world order it's alex jones well ever doubt is a very informed impressive individual
[2:33:35.560 --> 2:33:42.080]  that hsbc is an analyst in a stock picker and black rock as well many other places and
[2:33:42.080 --> 2:33:47.800]  he was on a week and a half ago with steve bannon and predicted all of what was about
[2:33:47.800 --> 2:33:51.160]  to happen with the stocks plunging all the rest of the interviews are out there will
[2:33:51.160 --> 2:33:55.880]  link to it today once the show isn't live the archive this interview at band on video
[2:33:55.880 --> 2:34:00.040]  with that interview under it so he's calling it like he sees in his analysis with his pen
[2:34:00.040 --> 2:34:05.360]  tweets here is like a prediction going back months and months ago of exactly what has
[2:34:05.360 --> 2:34:09.840]  happened so please continue with the funeral home numbers and I see those as well that's
[2:34:09.840 --> 2:34:13.800]  not hidden all over the western world they say it's unprecedented you got the cancer
[2:34:13.800 --> 2:34:18.400]  diagnosed diagnostic facility saying they're seeing explosive numbers we got the various
[2:34:18.400 --> 2:34:23.160]  system and then you were pointing out you know some of the other areas that are bringing
[2:34:23.160 --> 2:34:29.440]  numbers in this is really something that can't be suppressed and then I agree with you that
[2:34:29.440 --> 2:34:35.400]  this was done as a way to kind of have a pretext for why society broke instead of it being
[2:34:35.400 --> 2:34:40.760]  the fractional reserve banking and the fiat currency and the derivatives and the scams
[2:34:40.760 --> 2:34:46.480]  that were run but I don't see it going well for the managerial technocrat class kind of
[2:34:46.480 --> 2:34:52.760]  the Davos class that obviously all the evidence shows is trying to ride this tiger I think
[2:34:52.760 --> 2:34:59.400]  they're not riding a tiger I think they've got a tiger by the tail what do you say if
[2:34:59.400 --> 2:35:04.800]  this is a plot which I don't have any evidence for but you know I was running the show this
[2:35:04.800 --> 2:35:09.160]  is exactly what I would do if I wanted to prevent people from figuring out that I blew
[2:35:09.160 --> 2:35:16.240]  up the world with this sovereign debt problem it's not going well for them at all you know
[2:35:16.240 --> 2:35:21.440]  they you can't hide the bodies and that's the sad thing about this the bodies are piling
[2:35:21.440 --> 2:35:27.560]  up and you know I know people that I want to fact check me and I want to say something
[2:35:27.560 --> 2:35:31.840]  about some of the things I've said to you first of all when I went on the Steve Bannon
[2:35:31.840 --> 2:35:38.320]  show people I said I wanted to be a lightning rod and people said to me oh are you worried
[2:35:38.320 --> 2:35:41.480]  they're going to come after you I said no I want to be a lightning rod of people reaching
[2:35:41.480 --> 2:35:46.040]  out to me and that's occurred I have a team behind me Brooke Jackson reached out to me
[2:35:46.040 --> 2:35:54.840]  the Ventavia whistleblower an ex insurance sell side highly ranked institutional investor
[2:35:54.840 --> 2:35:59.720]  a sell side analyst reached out to me and he's helping me with this insurance analysis
[2:35:59.720 --> 2:36:04.480]  this isn't just me although I'm capable of it he saved me about three weeks worth of
[2:36:04.480 --> 2:36:08.720]  work and he has some good insights and he's an insurance expert so the thing I want to
[2:36:08.720 --> 2:36:12.520]  point out about these insurance numbers that the fact checkers might come after me on is
[2:36:12.520 --> 2:36:17.680]  these are group we focused on group life policies and that's important because you're going
[2:36:17.680 --> 2:36:22.840]  to see the results there first because that's mark to market the contract are signed every
[2:36:22.840 --> 2:36:28.000]  year for instance if you join a mid-sized company or a fortune 500 company as a 25 year
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:33.040]  old you get you know your health benefits your dental and you get some sort of life
[2:36:33.040 --> 2:36:38.580]  benefit it's to minimize 100 grand 200 grand something like that and so these are working
[2:36:38.580 --> 2:36:45.920]  age people these are not people that are depressed without jobs that are suicidal overdosing
[2:36:45.920 --> 2:36:51.560]  on fentanyl which is what the fact checkers will try to say these are people with jobs
[2:36:51.560 --> 2:36:57.040]  that are working and employed so that's an important thing to distinguish and these contracts
[2:36:57.040 --> 2:37:02.120]  and work to market they renew them every year so the data is fresh the individual policies
[2:37:02.120 --> 2:37:07.600]  are done under a different accounting system and will show up in different ways more slowly
[2:37:07.600 --> 2:37:13.800]  because it's business team insurance actuarial and accounting so we're not focused on that
[2:37:13.800 --> 2:37:18.400]  we're focused on group life policies and that's where these numbers are coming from so fact
[2:37:18.400 --> 2:37:27.440]  checkers fact check me all you want well said so where do you think this is going what I
[2:37:27.440 --> 2:37:30.760]  mean you extrapolate the numbers out months ago it's happened what what do you think's
[2:37:30.760 --> 2:37:37.720]  going to come next and this route in biotech stocks in gene therapy stocks is accelerating
[2:37:37.720 --> 2:37:41.760]  obviously rats are going to leave the sinking ship a lot of people are opportunist a lot
[2:37:41.760 --> 2:37:46.000]  of folks once they see gates and Fauci and others are in trouble are going to turn against
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:50.960]  them more whistleblowers are coming out faster than I keep track of them project veritas
[2:37:50.960 --> 2:37:56.080]  has a high level fda executive admitting it's all fraud I mean this is like it doesn't matter
[2:37:56.080 --> 2:38:00.040]  of the justice department doesn't act these people are convicted in the public what does
[2:38:00.040 --> 2:38:08.560]  that do to confidence in the system so let's talk about what's going to happen you know
[2:38:08.560 --> 2:38:15.680]  part of my thesis is that visor and the fda conspired much like the radio agencies were
[2:38:15.680 --> 2:38:21.320]  in on the financial crisis during the great financial crisis that you know they were
[2:38:21.320 --> 2:38:26.880]  making too much money they rubber stamp triple a bonds that went to zero or went down 60%
[2:38:26.880 --> 2:38:32.120]  it was due to money the institutional imperative which is when institutions act on the benefit
[2:38:32.120 --> 2:38:38.160]  of themselves rather than their stakeholders the fda is doing the same thing and james
[2:38:38.160 --> 2:38:43.000]  oakheese I've been saying that the institutional imperative has corrupted the fda james oakheese
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:48.840]  basically had proof yesterday that that's true it's all about the money 50% of budget
[2:38:48.840 --> 2:38:57.720]  from the fda comes from large cap pharma so over years the whole institution has been
[2:38:57.720 --> 2:39:02.080]  corrupted and the rubber stamping results and that's why they want to hide the data
[2:39:02.080 --> 2:39:06.560]  because the fraud will be exposed if the data is released so what what do I think is going
[2:39:06.560 --> 2:39:14.640]  to happen let me put it to you this way they're caught they're caught what does that mean
[2:39:14.640 --> 2:39:18.560]  well this is a different kind of fraud than we've ever seen because when other fraudsters
[2:39:18.560 --> 2:39:24.120]  got caught there were regulatory agencies that would come in and save the day doj doj
[2:39:24.120 --> 2:39:32.080]  sec fda if there was any kind of fraud in a clinical trial they're all captured or don't
[2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:40.360]  care or they don't the government is not coming to save us okay I would call that like type
[2:39:40.360 --> 2:39:49.080]  of corruption singularity corruption so you know the corruption is moved in the dot com
[2:39:49.080 --> 2:39:54.200]  error it was corporate fraud and the central banks pumped up the money and then the fraud
[2:39:54.200 --> 2:39:59.640]  moved on to it's a Ponzi scheme corporate the fraud always has to find a home and it moved
[2:39:59.640 --> 2:40:04.440]  on to the balance sheets of the central banks and not the central banks the banks in the
[2:40:04.440 --> 2:40:10.800]  great financial crisis then it moved then they pumped up the money again after 2008 2009
[2:40:10.800 --> 2:40:16.120]  and the corruptions now at the central banks and the governments so this corruption is
[2:40:16.120 --> 2:40:23.480]  just corruption writ large and so because no one's coming to save us the only way this
[2:40:23.480 --> 2:40:32.360]  is going to end is through political you know the politicians will turn on these partners
[2:40:32.360 --> 2:40:37.640]  of theirs they may be unwitting partners with these these people and they will turn at the
[2:40:37.640 --> 2:40:41.600]  court of public opinion turns and that's why we need to wake up more and more people across
[2:40:41.600 --> 2:40:47.680]  the nation as to what's going on so that the politicians will rat out everybody because
[2:40:47.680 --> 2:40:54.000]  that's what they do they're rats themselves secondly I expect it's going to get worse
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:58.040]  before it gets better because they're caught they're going to triple down so I expect complete
[2:40:58.040 --> 2:41:04.760]  another chaos the next three or four months you saw what Homeland Security put out a week
[2:41:04.760 --> 2:41:11.760]  ago that if you raise questions about the government institutions that so seeds of doubt
[2:41:11.760 --> 2:41:18.600]  you're a domestic terrorist because they they see what's coming so I mean I agree none of
[2:41:18.600 --> 2:41:24.720]  this is the signs of strength this is the signs of extreme panic and weakness they're
[2:41:24.720 --> 2:41:30.080]  yes so they're caught so what is the criminal think like a criminal there's an old saying
[2:41:30.080 --> 2:41:34.160]  on Wall Street think like a criminal to figure out what a criminal so the bus the person
[2:41:34.160 --> 2:41:40.880]  robin the bank he grabs the teller puts the gun to their head right so you know what's
[2:41:40.880 --> 2:41:43.680]  the criminal what's the criminal what are these guys going to do they can they can run
[2:41:43.680 --> 2:41:49.680]  well it's a global thing so there's nowhere to go so they're gonna triple down and they
[2:41:49.680 --> 2:41:57.880]  can try to scare people into silence I'm not gonna remain silent I agree with you so the
[2:41:57.880 --> 2:42:01.960]  answer is telling the truth final segment with our special guest ever doubt where do
[2:42:01.960 --> 2:42:10.760]  people find your work I know Twitter at DOW DED Ward and also on getter where else can
[2:42:10.760 --> 2:42:16.560]  folks find the great work you're doing I dump everything on getter and Twitter so it's
[2:42:16.560 --> 2:42:24.040]  Twitter at doubt Edward DOW D Edward and getter at Edward Dowd the OWD so Edward Dowd stay
[2:42:24.040 --> 2:42:28.280]  there final segment straight ahead but I can say this this is one hell of a time to be
[2:42:28.280 --> 2:42:32.560]  alive I think they're trying to start this war with Russia as a diversion they don't
[2:42:32.560 --> 2:42:37.240]  know what to do what else are they gonna pull a cyber attack you know Biden says other Russians
[2:42:37.240 --> 2:42:42.000]  are about to launch a cyber attack this is such an important time what can we do to try
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:46.200]  to land this plane with no casualties is my question because I don't want war with the
[2:42:46.200 --> 2:42:49.600]  globalist I don't want their scalps the wall I like to see them go to jail people don't
[2:42:49.600 --> 2:42:59.240]  do this anymore but I just want to stabilize the economy and not live in this evil sold

[2:47:05.840 --> 2:47:17.200]  Is that eerie sound going out for more than 20 days
[2:47:17.200 --> 2:47:22.560]  the capital of Canada that sends shock waves of fear into the establishment? They thought they
[2:47:22.560 --> 2:47:27.600]  could control the media. They thought they could control the population. They thought we would
[2:47:27.600 --> 2:47:32.400]  accept the obvious depopulation right in front of us but we didn't. You go back to Operation
[2:47:32.400 --> 2:47:36.720]  Lockstep and Event Two and One and Others it's very clear this is an orchestrated event and if you
[2:47:36.720 --> 2:47:43.440]  go back two years ago and Edward Dowd's tweets as I was just showing earlier over your TV viewer
[2:47:43.440 --> 2:47:49.360]  he was predicting all of this as an analyst and a stock picker could do and he's here now so in the
[2:47:49.360 --> 2:47:53.360]  six, seven, eight minutes we have left I really appreciate you. We'll be watching what you're

[2:47:56.720 --> 2:48:01.840]  Owen Troyer 3 p.m. Central whenever you like but other things you'd like to impart to the several
[2:48:01.840 --> 2:48:09.040]  million people tuned in right now. Thank you Alex. First of all I just want to say thank you for
[2:48:09.040 --> 2:48:17.520]  your bravery and what you do without alternative voices and you're guiding light to a lot of
[2:48:17.520 --> 2:48:23.280]  the alternative media so I just want to thank you for your bravery and the multiple lawsuits you
[2:48:23.280 --> 2:48:28.800]  seem to be under and the amount of your personal capital you've had to spend on that so I applaud
[2:48:28.800 --> 2:48:33.280]  you. God bless you brother it's well worth it but thank you for the kind words so you're your
[2:48:33.280 --> 2:48:37.280]  smart guy you predicted all this and you're dead on that the rats are leaving the city ship what
[2:48:37.280 --> 2:48:42.560]  comes next or what else do you want to tell folks. Well it's going to get worse from here but it's
[2:48:42.560 --> 2:48:48.400]  there's light at the end of the tunnel they're not going to win there's the awakening is happening
[2:48:48.400 --> 2:48:55.040]  so fast and I saw your show a couple days ago where you drew a graph of the awakening and it's
[2:48:55.040 --> 2:49:00.240]  going parabolic like you said and if I'm any indication of that let me tell you what's happened
[2:49:00.240 --> 2:49:05.680]  in the last four weeks since I started really getting notoriety. I've had old Wall Street
[2:49:05.680 --> 2:49:10.480]  colleagues reach out many have had these thoughts that I've had but haven't been able to express them
[2:49:10.480 --> 2:49:19.120]  for fear or not wanting to be seen as crazy and I've had so many increases into all sorts of
[2:49:19.120 --> 2:49:25.600]  social media and people expressing the same kind of things so the awakening is going parabolic
[2:49:26.400 --> 2:49:32.560]  and we're going to win so that's that but it's going to get worse before it gets better don't
[2:49:32.560 --> 2:49:41.360]  be afraid there's just not enough people to you know I guess what I want to say is I implore
[2:49:41.360 --> 2:49:47.440]  people to be brave now and what that means is however you want it to be it could be as simple
[2:49:47.440 --> 2:49:54.320]  as taking the information you've seen from Alex or myself about this fraud and showing it to a
[2:49:54.320 --> 2:50:01.360]  loved one who still thinks that this vaccine is the way to go and show them the stock prices say
[2:50:01.360 --> 2:50:06.960]  Wall Street's smelling something bad so this is a battle for the marginal mind and everybody in the
[2:50:06.960 --> 2:50:13.280]  country needs to start acting and having tough conversations with people that they love that
[2:50:13.280 --> 2:50:19.120]  may not agree with them and we can change it one mind at a time my job the last four weeks has been
[2:50:19.120 --> 2:50:24.720]  to have one Wall Street mind changed at a time and it's happening it's one phone call at a time
[2:50:24.720 --> 2:50:28.240]  and what finally pushed you over the edge because I saw the stuff on twitter going years back you
[2:50:28.240 --> 2:50:34.720]  predicted this but what made you really go on the offense four weeks ago well so you know look
[2:50:34.720 --> 2:50:43.280]  God is involved here I in you know I my voice was a lot smaller and in September of last year
[2:50:43.280 --> 2:50:47.440]  I was praying to God to make me useful and of service and then Dr. Malone came to the island
[2:50:47.440 --> 2:50:54.960]  in October and I was lucky enough through I think an act of God to go to the private dinners he was
[2:50:54.960 --> 2:51:01.680]  at to be able to present to him a document called the Malone Doctrine which we don't need to talk
[2:51:01.680 --> 2:51:09.520]  about now and he and I become friends and due to my association with him I'm now put in the spotlight
[2:51:09.520 --> 2:51:16.480]  so I've had these thoughts I just had a bigger microphone to get them out and unfortunately
[2:51:19.360 --> 2:51:26.800]  the data is so overwhelming that that's why my voice is rising it's obvious to most people now
[2:51:26.800 --> 2:51:32.560]  that are away that this is not a conspiracy theory this is happening people are dropping dead
[2:51:32.560 --> 2:51:38.240]  people are being maimed I agree well it's like at a wedding in case somebody wants to challenge it
[2:51:38.240 --> 2:51:42.960]  you say if anyone wants to challenge this wedding let them speak now or forever hold their peace
[2:51:42.960 --> 2:51:46.400]  maybe the groom doesn't want it maybe the bride doesn't want it maybe the father the brother the
[2:51:46.400 --> 2:51:51.040]  cousin old boyfriend well this isn't a marriage of a wedding one this is a marriage of death and
[2:51:51.040 --> 2:51:57.040]  evil and and the new world order so speak now forever hold your peace like what you said courage
[2:51:57.040 --> 2:52:02.640]  now this is the time to be speaking out this is the zeitgeist because they've made their big move
[2:52:02.640 --> 2:52:08.400]  and if you don't stand up now I think the Rubicon for them was the children even with the regulators
[2:52:08.400 --> 2:52:13.040]  in Europe and here's saying no don't give it to kids and finally that seems to be the breaking
[2:52:13.040 --> 2:52:17.680]  point is like with Tony Montana the fictional character where they want him to blow up the
[2:52:17.680 --> 2:52:22.640]  little girls in the guy's car he goes I told you no women no kids there's that point where
[2:52:22.640 --> 2:52:32.480]  you're like I can't be part of this I agree it's basically they cross the Rubicon
[2:52:34.720 --> 2:52:40.560]  and it's a problem and people are not going to stand for it well I'm a decent judge of body
[2:52:40.560 --> 2:52:44.080]  language and I don't take pleasure in this because they're dangerous they're corner but I look at
[2:52:44.080 --> 2:52:48.080]  Fauci and Bill Gates they don't look arrogant anymore Klaus Schwab doesn't look arrogant more
[2:52:48.080 --> 2:52:52.880]  they look scared and it happened about two months ago they start they look really scared now
[2:52:52.880 --> 2:52:57.760]  and they're also acting scared and you see that with the Moderna CEO and others running scared
[2:52:57.760 --> 2:53:03.600]  I'm concerned though what are they going to pull now that they are cornered animals well let's
[2:53:03.600 --> 2:53:09.440]  talk about what I am an observer of things Fauci's been a no show on the morning shows he's kind of
[2:53:09.440 --> 2:53:15.840]  disappeared the last three weeks that's very interesting to me Janet Yellen Treasury Secretary
[2:53:16.880 --> 2:53:22.560]  is a no show as bond market yields are rising in stock markets wobble wobble where is she
[2:53:23.360 --> 2:53:27.280]  where are the cabinet members I don't see a lot of news coming from them the only people I'm here
[2:53:27.280 --> 2:53:35.760]  and from are the Crypt Keeper Pothos Puppet Biden and Pisaki those are the only two people I see
[2:53:35.760 --> 2:53:41.600]  so there's something going on I think behind the scenes because of the strange silence from a lot
[2:53:41.600 --> 2:53:45.280]  of the I mean look at her body language she looks like she's about in front of a firing squad right
[2:53:45.280 --> 2:53:54.800]  there she's not arrogant anymore is she no no and you know I think they know some they know they're
[2:53:54.800 --> 2:54:00.160]  caught and this is that you know when you're caught you disappear and that's what's happening
[2:54:00.800 --> 2:54:03.920]  wow we got three minutes left brother what else you want to tell folks we really appreciate
[2:54:03.920 --> 2:54:13.360]  all your great knowledge um well uh let me think I mean we hit a lot of great stuff here why don't
[2:54:13.360 --> 2:54:16.640]  you ask me a question well you know once you leave there's something you wish you were going to say
[2:54:16.640 --> 2:54:20.400]  that's why I can always ask other questions but what what else is it you want to get out there
[2:54:22.640 --> 2:54:30.800]  um we're having an impact and you're having an impact and you know I think the big
[2:54:30.800 --> 2:54:34.960]  point I want to make out to people is what I said at the beginning of the broadcast
[2:54:34.960 --> 2:54:42.720]  Wall Street is awake and they're not happy a lot of these people were forced to take jabs
[2:54:43.600 --> 2:54:48.880]  because of the firms they worked for but they as they start to awaken to the fact that they were
[2:54:48.880 --> 2:54:58.960]  jabbed with a let's call it a poison uh they're gonna they're the the capital behind these stocks
[2:54:58.960 --> 2:55:02.640]  will quickly dissipate meaning the people that own them will sell the stocks and the hedge funds
[2:55:02.640 --> 2:55:09.200]  will jump on these like charts uh uh when they smell blood and these stocks will get pummeled
[2:55:09.200 --> 2:55:13.920]  and that will awaken up a lot of people that's my biggest point on a drive home is you're trying
[2:55:13.920 --> 2:55:18.720]  to convince someone that there's something going on show them the stocks and say that's the smartest
[2:55:18.720 --> 2:55:23.120]  thing I've heard I never even thought of that I'm so dumb tank the stock that's what people really
[2:55:23.120 --> 2:55:31.280]  look at that shows them that creates a reality on its own absolutely so many people actually
[2:55:31.280 --> 2:55:36.640]  look what's in it they look if everybody's lined up to get it but if we can show them that absolutely
[2:55:36.640 --> 2:55:42.400]  so my biggest concern is war I think this whole Russia thing is how they try to distract us but
[2:55:42.400 --> 2:55:47.040]  luckily the Russians aren't playing along so that's got to really piss them off in closing in one
[2:55:47.040 --> 2:55:51.120]  minute what else do you think the establishment pulls just gut level but you know first thing
[2:55:51.120 --> 2:55:55.280]  in your mind what do they pull next yeah you just you just triggered I was going to say something
[2:55:55.280 --> 2:56:03.280]  earlier but I forgot to go ahead look I had no idea who claus schwa was before COVID or what the
[2:56:03.280 --> 2:56:08.960]  world economic form was but you know they seem to have had a coming out party and this bond villain
[2:56:09.600 --> 2:56:17.520]  bond accent villain speaking weirdo who wears a klingon outfit um told us in 2020 that the next
[2:56:17.520 --> 2:56:24.960]  threat is a cyber virus okay that's interesting so let's let's let's take him at his word now well
[2:56:24.960 --> 2:56:30.560]  then what happened in the fall we had cyber polygon a bunch of nations got together to war game this
[2:56:30.560 --> 2:56:37.520]  so I wouldn't be surprised if we saw the internet or electrical grids go down and they blame it on
[2:56:37.520 --> 2:56:45.360]  the Russians the Chinese you know Iranian hackers North Koreans whatever I mean this is
[2:56:45.360 --> 2:56:49.520]  this is not beyond uh something that this is something I actually expect I mean if I had
[2:56:49.520 --> 2:56:57.360]  to predict something it's going to be some cyber virus I totally agree I absolutely think you're
[2:56:57.360 --> 2:57:03.760]  right all right Edward Dowd thank you so much former wall street professional HSBC black rock
[2:57:03.760 --> 2:57:10.480]  you name it and you can find him at do wd e d w ward you can find him right there and we really

[2:57:55.280 --> 2:58:02.160]  lockdowns until the populations rebelled they would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[2:58:02.160 --> 2:58:08.720]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives but because of so
[2:58:08.720 --> 2:58:14.000]  many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers
[2:58:14.720 --> 2:58:21.440]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government
[2:58:21.440 --> 2:58:27.280]  corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever the problem is some
[2:58:27.280 --> 2:58:32.640]  globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover like canada but they've now
[2:58:32.640 --> 2:58:38.560]  declared a civil emergency and martial law in ontario and other areas of the world are following
[2:58:38.560 --> 2:58:44.240]  suit like australia so pray for these folks big time it's a very serious situation and stay tuned

[3:02:36.800 --> 3:02:42.160]  I'll tell you there really is no courage in that it seems like it takes courage to fight evil but
[3:02:42.160 --> 3:02:45.680]  the courage would be to just sit there and let evil take over mindlessly and let it beat you
[3:02:46.240 --> 3:02:50.720]  what I do is not through courage it's through self preservation and instinct and a spirit

[3:06:32.880 --> 3:06:39.920]  hour 17th of february 2022 got huge news coming up on russia with blinken coming out and having
[3:06:39.920 --> 3:06:46.400]  a colin powell movement or moment of course the associated press came out a few days ago last
[3:06:46.400 --> 3:06:52.800]  week in fact and said that the us state department was having an alex jones moment by saying that
[3:06:52.800 --> 3:06:58.800]  russia was preparing a false flag with crisis actors now blinken's come out in front of the
[3:06:58.800 --> 3:07:06.160]  un gave a speech and accused russia of planning a chemical attack as a pretext to invade ukraine
[3:07:06.160 --> 3:07:12.080]  where we heard that before in every single instance that the deep state is trying to justify its
[3:07:12.080 --> 3:07:18.560]  own involvement in another theater of war also going to get into the latest with the canadian
[3:07:18.560 --> 3:07:26.800]  truckers of course the media has hysterically exploited the hack the doxing of give send go
[3:07:26.800 --> 3:07:35.040]  donors which happened on sunday evening to try and pursue harass intimidate bully out people
[3:07:35.040 --> 3:07:40.640]  ordinary people choosing to give their hard-earned income to political causes that they support
[3:07:40.640 --> 3:07:46.240]  god forbid they would do that name and shame them that's not journalism that's harassment
[3:07:46.240 --> 3:07:51.920]  that's intimidation that is exploitation of doxing we're going to get into more information
[3:07:51.920 --> 3:07:58.960]  about that first though i want to start with the uh 100 safe and effective covet vaccine
[3:07:58.960 --> 3:08:03.600]  because we have an update on the comedian who collapsed on stage after bragging about
[3:08:03.600 --> 3:08:10.240]  now taking a booster shot tried to make a joke about it literally 10 seconds later was face
[3:08:10.240 --> 3:08:15.600]  planted on the floor headliner of summit news comedian who collapsed on stage after bragging
[3:08:15.600 --> 3:08:23.520]  about booster says she won't be getting the fourth shot i'm sorry but you have to laugh
[3:08:23.520 --> 3:08:30.800]  she's perfectly fine she ended up coming to no harm for now so you have to laugh this was
[3:08:30.800 --> 3:08:38.560]  absolutely incredible heather mcdonnell did a show in tempe arizona earlier this month she said
[3:08:38.560 --> 3:08:44.560]  and you've probably all seen the clip by now i'm vax double vax boosted flu shot and shingleshot
[3:08:44.560 --> 3:08:51.440]  haven't gotten coveted and jesus loves me the most literally 10 seconds later slam she was
[3:08:51.440 --> 3:08:58.400]  faced first on the floor well now there's been an update to this because she went on dr drew's
[3:08:58.400 --> 3:09:05.600]  podcast who to be fair to him dr drew's been pretty based on some other issues but she revealed that
[3:09:05.600 --> 3:09:11.440]  he had she had taken two doses of the Pfizer vaccine but had a moderna booster shot three
[3:09:11.440 --> 3:09:18.960]  weeks previously to her incredible face planting collapse on stage dr drew pointed out that the
[3:09:18.960 --> 3:09:25.360]  most common time period for adverse reactions to occur from the 100 safe and effective according
[3:09:25.360 --> 3:09:32.560]  to fact checkers booster was quote two to three weeks after taking the booster shot and that one
[3:09:32.560 --> 3:09:39.120]  of the side effects was fainting drew also asked mcdonnell if she was aware of any quote evidence
[3:09:39.120 --> 3:09:44.080]  of myocarditis and proving her complete ignorance which is probably why she took the third booster
[3:09:44.080 --> 3:09:51.440]  shot mcdonnell said she'd never heard anything about myocarditis a lot of premier league footballers
[3:09:51.440 --> 3:09:58.400]  and others across europe certainly have heard about it now after multiple coincidental according to
[3:09:58.400 --> 3:10:04.080]  the experts collapses of soccer players minutes into games some of whom have tragically died at
[3:10:04.080 --> 3:10:11.120]  the peak of physical health and physical conditioning again just the coincidence so mcdonnell didn't
[3:10:11.120 --> 3:10:17.600]  express any dreaded anti-vax views but she did say the collapse had made her reconsider getting
[3:10:17.600 --> 3:10:23.840]  jabbed again quote i mean you know what can i do now i don't think i'm going to get the fourth
[3:10:23.840 --> 3:10:34.400]  booster shot though i will say that she said i think i'm done meanwhile the glasgow times reports
[3:10:34.400 --> 3:10:40.240]  covet data will not be published over concerns it's misrepresented by anti-vaxes move along
[3:10:40.240 --> 3:10:46.080]  nothing to see here public health scotland that's the official public health body over the scottish
[3:10:46.080 --> 3:10:52.240]  government will stop publishing data on covet deaths and hospitalizations by vaccination status
[3:10:52.960 --> 3:10:59.840]  over concerns it's misrepresented by anti-vax campaign it's now you would think if as the
[3:10:59.840 --> 3:11:06.000]  narrative goes the people who are unvaccinated are more likely to die from covet or more likely
[3:11:06.000 --> 3:11:11.760]  to need serious treatment ventilation treatment in hospitals from covet if they haven't taken the
[3:11:11.760 --> 3:11:18.080]  vaccine you would think scotland's public health body would be more keen to make those statistics
[3:11:18.080 --> 3:11:24.960]  those figures as public as humanly possible but no they've gone the exact opposite way the public
[3:11:24.960 --> 3:11:29.760]  health watch dogged down to the change in policy in its most recent covet statistical report saying
[3:11:29.760 --> 3:11:34.640]  the frequency and content of the data would be reviewed now they're literally trying to hide
[3:11:34.640 --> 3:11:40.720]  the information from the public does phs official sex significant concerns about the data being
[3:11:40.720 --> 3:11:46.240]  misused deliberately by anti-vaccination campaigners is behind the move the report published on
[3:11:46.240 --> 3:11:51.280]  wednesday will be the last weekly publication to include the data on infection rates among the
[3:11:51.280 --> 3:11:57.600]  vaccinated and unvaccinated it also includes hospitalization and death rates broken down by
[3:11:57.600 --> 3:12:03.360]  the number of doses received so they're literally trying to sweep under the carpet the number of
[3:12:03.360 --> 3:12:10.880]  people in hospitals in scotland who are dying from covet based on whether they're vaccinated or
[3:12:10.880 --> 3:12:16.640]  unvaccinated again you would think they'd be singing it from the rooftops if it backed up their
[3:12:16.640 --> 3:12:24.160]  narrative that the unvaccinated in far greater numbers would be dying from covet but they're
[3:12:24.160 --> 3:12:30.160]  not they've gone the exact opposite way and said they're not going to publish the data at all
[3:12:30.160 --> 3:12:36.480]  interesting that isn't it meanwhile in austria which by the way it looks like they're going to drop
[3:12:36.480 --> 3:12:42.880]  this mandatory vaccination vaccination policy next month at some point of course in england we had
[3:12:42.880 --> 3:12:50.160]  the NHS mandate for NHS nurses to get vaccinated the government has backpedaled backtracked on that
[3:12:50.160 --> 3:12:55.360]  and dropped it looks like a similar thing is going to be happening in austria and in fact the people
[3:12:55.360 --> 3:13:01.520]  that they hired the government to quote hunt down vaccine refuse nicks won't be needed for very much
[3:13:01.520 --> 3:13:08.960]  longer turns out according to studies forced vaccination policy in austria has no impact on
[3:13:08.960 --> 3:13:15.520]  jab uptake austria's best-selling newspapers as the government's introduction of a mandatory
[3:13:15.520 --> 3:13:20.720]  vaccination policy has had no discernible impact on jab uptake in the nation's capital and could
[3:13:20.720 --> 3:13:27.280]  have even caused a drop off yes it only caused the backlash the rebellion to be fuelled to an
[3:13:27.280 --> 3:13:33.520]  even greater degree since the compulsory jab mandate came into force on february 5th crone
[3:13:33.520 --> 3:13:38.640]  and zeitung that's the big newspaper in austria reports that the law actually caused the reduction
[3:13:38.640 --> 3:13:45.360]  in the number of people being vaccinated newspaper reported quote there's no mandatory
[3:13:45.360 --> 3:13:51.440]  vaccination effect and if there is then rather in the other direction so the day after they
[3:13:51.440 --> 3:13:58.720]  introduced the vaccine mandate in austria they found that fewer people than the day before actually
[3:13:58.720 --> 3:14:05.200]  decided to get vaccinated doesn't work their intimidation their threats did not work and
[3:14:05.200 --> 3:14:12.400]  now they're having to drop the mandate good news meanwhile levi brand president says she was offered
[3:14:12.400 --> 3:14:19.200]  one million dollars to shut up about being fired over criticizing covid restrictions this is levi
[3:14:19.200 --> 3:14:24.720]  former brand president jennifer say who is a former gymnast who made the assertion in an
[3:14:24.720 --> 3:14:33.120]  article posted on barry weiss's substack where she was indeed fired by levi's after a targeted mob
[3:14:33.120 --> 3:14:39.360]  campaign because god forbid she dared to suggest that children wearing masks and forcing them to
[3:14:39.360 --> 3:14:45.600]  miss school would have an impact on their education and as we've seen with speech therapists their
[3:14:45.600 --> 3:14:54.640]  cognitive development 364 increase in children displaying symptoms of autism and problems with
[3:14:54.640 --> 3:15:02.080]  cognitive development as it relates to speech because of adults wearing masks they learn how
[3:15:02.080 --> 3:15:08.400]  to develop language by lip reading by watching and hearing people talk when you take that away from
[3:15:08.400 --> 3:15:14.640]  babies and toddlers their emotional their cognitive development gets stunted which is why it's still
[3:15:14.640 --> 3:15:22.640]  an absolute disgrace but i still see parents today in the park pushing prams with babies
[3:15:22.640 --> 3:15:29.600]  they're both wearing masks outside there's never even been a law in england that you had to wear
[3:15:29.600 --> 3:15:36.800]  a mask outside they removed all the restrictions for wearing them inside weeks ago why in the blue
[3:15:36.800 --> 3:15:42.720]  hell are these religious not jobs which is what it is at this point and it's an extremist religion
[3:15:42.720 --> 3:15:47.440]  with their little trinkets their little sacrifice their little devotion to it why are they still

[3:17:00.080 --> 3:17:06.000]  calling this gain of function research now if you read the actual you know 2014 legislation the u.s
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:11.920]  government gain of function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of
[3:17:11.920 --> 3:17:17.520]  function research involving influenza mers and zars virus there's nothing about zars like viruses
[3:17:17.520 --> 3:17:22.400]  and it's a research funding pause it's not a stop it's not a prohibition it's when you come to a
[3:17:22.400 --> 3:17:26.960]  four-way intersection there's the stop sign you stop you look both ways and then you proceed and
[3:17:26.960 --> 3:17:32.160]  so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function just selected gain of function but they'll argue
[3:17:32.160 --> 3:17:37.200]  that this is actually characterization and qualification research so you know rand and
[3:17:37.200 --> 3:17:40.800]  the others you know maybe fouchy was right they don't quite know what they're talking about calling
[3:17:40.800 --> 3:17:44.800]  a gain of function you know that's why he didn't perjure himself that's why he hasn't been arrested
[3:17:44.800 --> 3:17:49.440]  because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do but in
[3:17:49.440 --> 3:17:53.920]  the main definition it's still a gain of function they're making something deadly that spreads more

[3:20:24.560 --> 3:20:30.400]  well february 16th yesterday of course saw the despicable russian invasion of ukraine
[3:20:30.400 --> 3:20:37.520]  200 000 troops pouring into the country missiles raining down as we were told by us
[3:20:37.520 --> 3:20:41.920]  intelligence officials as we were told by the mainstream media would happen at the end of last
[3:20:41.920 --> 3:20:47.520]  week uh no that didn't actually happen nothing happened and now they've started to remove the
[3:20:47.520 --> 3:20:53.280]  troops from the border let's start off with this short video i made yesterday and then i'll go on
[3:20:53.280 --> 3:20:59.520]  to talk about the latest developments today this is but the regime promised me a war here's the clip
[3:21:00.320 --> 3:21:06.160]  well here we are february 16th russian invasion day russia set to invade ukraine at 1am tomorrow
[3:21:06.160 --> 3:21:11.040]  with massive missile blitz and 200 000 troops that didn't age well did it neither did this from
[3:21:11.040 --> 3:21:16.720]  friday russia will start a physical assault on ukraine as soon as february 16 multiple u.s officials
[3:21:16.720 --> 3:21:21.680]  confirmed to politica what actually happened russia started withdrawing troops and weaponry from
[3:21:21.680 --> 3:21:26.080]  the ukrainian border after their exercises in belarus ended osko announced that all their troops
[3:21:26.080 --> 3:21:30.320]  currently stationed near ukraine would return to their normal positions within four weeks ukrainian
[3:21:30.320 --> 3:21:35.200]  president volodymyr zolensky awkwardly said his declaration of a public holiday to mark the russian
[3:21:35.200 --> 3:21:40.800]  invasion that never happened had been a joke and now top zolensky ally david or akamya says there's
[3:21:40.800 --> 3:21:46.320]  a 99.9 percent chance that absolutely nothing will happen the russian foreign ministry is called on
[3:21:46.320 --> 3:21:50.640]  western media outlets to publish a full list of dates on which russia will invade ukraine for the
[3:21:50.640 --> 3:21:55.920]  year ahead so russian diplomats can schedule their vacations accordingly this is not satire
[3:21:55.920 --> 3:22:01.520]  they did this but the legacy media promised me a war the same legacy media that constantly
[3:22:01.520 --> 3:22:08.560]  winds about misinformation and fact-checking will now have to fact-check itself or maybe not it's
[3:22:08.560 --> 3:22:13.920]  okay when we do it so russia has been saying for weeks that the u.s and nato's insistence that
[3:22:13.920 --> 3:22:19.360]  they were going to invade ukraine in mid february was alarmist hysteria and baseless propaganda
[3:22:19.360 --> 3:22:25.520]  we passed mid february and nothing happens so are we to conclude that russia was correct how dare
[3:22:25.520 --> 3:22:30.800]  you that's russian propaganda anyone who doesn't amplify breathless regime media propaganda about
[3:22:30.800 --> 3:22:36.160]  how russia's definitely going to invade any day now promise anyone who isn't maniacally twitching
[3:22:36.160 --> 3:22:42.400]  with glee about the imminent prospect of another catastrophic war must be a russian agent right
[3:22:42.400 --> 3:22:50.400]  low bar these days isn't it pretty low bar and that's not even a joke by the way the the ap came
[3:22:50.400 --> 3:22:55.680]  out a couple of days ago quoting us intelligence officials who have proven so spectacularly wrong
[3:22:55.680 --> 3:23:01.840]  time and time again and said that zero hedge was russian propaganda because they god forbid
[3:23:01.840 --> 3:23:08.400]  showcased posted articles by people who didn't completely 100 agree with the nato propaganda
[3:23:08.400 --> 3:23:14.960]  line and said that no there's not going to be any invasion of ukraine and there wasn't but don't
[3:23:14.960 --> 3:23:21.280]  worry because biden has come out today this is out of rt and said in the next few days just
[3:23:21.280 --> 3:23:26.320]  wait it's going to happen russia will invade ukraine in next several days you can believe them this
[3:23:26.320 --> 3:23:34.240]  time says joe biden he told reporters thursday russia is prepared to go into ukraine attack ukraine
[3:23:34.240 --> 3:23:38.720]  the risk is very high there's every indication we have every indication they had at the end of
[3:23:38.720 --> 3:23:47.040]  last week proven completely incorrect so now blinken the secretary of state has gone in front
[3:23:47.040 --> 3:23:52.160]  of the un and had a coal and power movement headline out of zero hedge the russian propaganda
[3:23:52.160 --> 3:23:58.320]  outfit blinken lays out russian false flag chemical attack claims in dramatic u n security
[3:23:58.320 --> 3:24:03.600]  council speech the same false flag chemical attack presumably that the obama administration
[3:24:03.600 --> 3:24:09.280]  talked about happening in syria back all those years ago that turned out to be actually a
[3:24:09.280 --> 3:24:15.440]  false flag carried out by the obama administration back syrian rebels they're playing that propaganda
[3:24:15.440 --> 3:24:20.880]  card once again blinken went in front of the un and basically had a coal and power movement
[3:24:20.880 --> 3:24:26.480]  a moment surprised he didn't hold up a vial of water and said i'm here today not to start a war
[3:24:26.480 --> 3:24:32.000]  but to prevent one because they really don't want a war they just talk about one happening every
[3:24:32.000 --> 3:24:36.800]  single day and it never happens but they don't want a war and he's talking about talking about
[3:24:36.800 --> 3:24:42.880]  russia carrying out terrorist bombings inside russia again using crisis actors false flags
[3:24:42.880 --> 3:24:48.480]  because the us deep state would never do that would they discovery of fake mass graves they
[3:24:48.480 --> 3:24:54.480]  were talking about even an attack on an orphan facility similar to the whole saddam hasane
[3:24:54.480 --> 3:24:59.920]  line you know throwing babies out of incubators in q8 which again was another completely contrived
[3:24:59.920 --> 3:25:06.160]  false flag by the us deep state so they know of where they speak because they've done the exact
[3:25:06.160 --> 3:25:13.040]  same thing so blinken's being humiliated once again even the check president has come out and
[3:25:13.040 --> 3:25:19.840]  said russia would be quote crazy to start a war with ukraine this is milosh zeman who says russia
[3:25:19.840 --> 3:25:25.280]  would be crazy to start war with ukraine and he's compared the constant false claims that they are
[3:25:25.280 --> 3:25:32.720]  about to attack so the embarrassments of failing to find weapons of mass destruction in iraq and
[3:25:32.720 --> 3:25:37.600]  the taliban takeover of kabul which of course the biden administration said would never happen
[3:25:38.560 --> 3:25:43.200]  he said quote as for the u.s intelligence services this is their third embarrassment
[3:25:43.200 --> 3:25:47.840]  the first was in iraq where no weapons of mass destruction were found the second was in afghanistan
[3:25:47.840 --> 3:25:54.160]  when they claimed taliban would never conquer Kabul well the third is now but again biden says it's
[3:25:54.160 --> 3:25:59.840]  about to happen tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow you can trust them now they've got a stellar record
[3:25:59.840 --> 3:26:07.280]  right an absolute stellar record even one of the ukrainian president's top allies has come out today
[3:26:07.280 --> 3:26:14.480]  and said western media reports of russian attack were quote obviously fake news and he's come out
[3:26:14.480 --> 3:26:20.960]  and said that this actually harms ukraine because it massively negatively negatively impacts their
[3:26:20.960 --> 3:26:27.280]  economy to the tune of three billion dollars a day this is david arakami of the head of the servant
[3:26:27.280 --> 3:26:32.160]  of the people faction in kiebs parliament who said that the crisis would be all over in a
[3:26:32.160 --> 3:26:39.200]  matter of weeks and that u.s media propaganda namely cnn and the wall street journal was just as
[3:26:39.200 --> 3:26:44.240]  bad as russian propaganda he said quote i think that when the phase is over in the two or three
[3:26:44.240 --> 3:26:49.280]  weeks we should make a retrospective analysis of how a large well-known media began to spread
[3:26:49.280 --> 3:26:56.560]  information worse than the allies of latinia putin he said quote obviously fake news in cnn
[3:26:56.560 --> 3:27:02.400]  bloomberg wall street journal we have to study this because it's part of a hybrid war you went on to
[3:27:02.400 --> 3:27:09.520]  blame legacy media quote fake news for negatively impacting the ukrainian economy saying that the
[3:27:09.520 --> 3:27:15.040]  invasion rumors the fake invasion rumors are costing the country up to three billion dollars a month
[3:27:15.040 --> 3:27:24.320]  meanwhile the russian officials in the kremlin are openly now mocking western intelligence
[3:27:24.320 --> 3:27:29.920]  agencies remember we had the political report on sunday it's definitely going to happen it's
[3:27:29.920 --> 3:27:36.640]  going to happen on the 16th yesterday now they're mocking them with memes after the establishment
[3:27:36.640 --> 3:27:40.640]  media hyped up and predicted a russian invasion of ukraine for this past wednesday that didn't
[3:27:40.640 --> 3:27:45.760]  happen the russian government took to twitter to mock them russia's ministry of foreign affairs
[3:27:45.760 --> 3:27:51.280]  tweeted comments made by spokeswoman maria zarkaria who said quote today we mark another day
[3:27:51.280 --> 3:27:56.480]  at the start of war with ukraine which did not happen again to the western media outlets regret
[3:27:56.480 --> 3:28:03.520]  no matter how hard they whip up the hysteria and they posted an image of tumbleweeds basically
[3:28:03.520 --> 3:28:08.720]  saying that nothing's going to happen nothing is happening the fact that they keep insisting that
[3:28:08.720 --> 3:28:13.120]  it's going to happen there's going to be a false flag there's going to be a russian incursion there's
[3:28:13.120 --> 3:28:19.360]  going to be a russian invasion being proven wrong time and time again so now you've got the
[3:28:19.360 --> 3:28:23.920]  cheque president coming out and saying the same thing that this is only causing a further
[3:28:24.640 --> 3:28:31.360]  discrediting of the u.s. deep state of nato officials and now you've got who uh ukrainian
[3:28:31.360 --> 3:28:37.040]  president's own ally coming out and saying that this is not only complete bs fake news that it's
[3:28:37.040 --> 3:28:42.480]  actually harming the ukrainian economy harming their national confidence because their own
[3:28:42.480 --> 3:28:47.520]  population has started to believe that this invasion is imminent when it is not going to
[3:28:47.520 --> 3:28:53.840]  happen it's not in putin's interest to do it at least right now summit dot news will be back

[3:32:55.520 --> 3:33:14.880]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:33:25.840 --> 3:33:32.880]  we are back and it is the summit news hour we're going to go to this video now because we have
[3:33:32.880 --> 3:33:39.680]  the continuation of the valiant courageous freedom convoy protest against the true dow regime
[3:33:39.680 --> 3:33:46.560]  as the government of canada continues to demonize smear and monster those brave demonstrators as
[3:33:46.560 --> 3:33:52.320]  literal violent extremists and terrorists of course we have the give send go hack attack
[3:33:52.320 --> 3:34:00.400]  and doxing of the 90 000 donors to the freedom convoy protesters occur on sunday and then the
[3:34:00.400 --> 3:34:08.160]  mainstream media cbc washington post and others immediately exploited seized upon that weaponized
[3:34:08.160 --> 3:34:14.960]  it to harass and intimidate the people who donated i mean god forbid people don't donate their hard
[3:34:14.960 --> 3:34:21.600]  earned income to political causes that they support we can't have that can we so let's go to this video
[3:34:21.600 --> 3:34:25.920]  the mob and the media and then i'll come back and talk about the latest developments here it is
[3:34:26.880 --> 3:34:32.560]  the media hyped hacking of give send go and the doxing of canadians who supported the trucker
[3:34:32.560 --> 3:34:39.360]  convoy protest is now causing real world harm threats close stellar luna gelato cafe after
[3:34:39.360 --> 3:34:45.680]  owner's name appears in give send go data leak after tammy juliani's name was docked vile leftist
[3:34:45.680 --> 3:34:50.800]  thugs threatened to ransack her business and violently attack anyone who worked there we got
[3:34:50.800 --> 3:34:56.000]  a call from the team saying we're getting phone calls here juliani said i said what's going on
[3:34:56.000 --> 3:35:00.240]  and they said they're demanding to throw bricks through our window they're threatening to come
[3:35:00.240 --> 3:35:05.280]  and get us we said lock the door and we'll find out what's going on note how the otter was citizen
[3:35:05.280 --> 3:35:11.360]  frames the cafe owner as being in the wrong not the cretins who threatened to smash up her business
[3:35:11.360 --> 3:35:17.840]  tammy juliani says she now regrets making a 250 donation or god forbid ordinary working people
[3:35:17.840 --> 3:35:22.240]  should be allowed to express their political proclivities via their hard-earned income
[3:35:22.240 --> 3:35:26.960]  journalists are a weapon used by the powerful to keep the average person in a constant state of
[3:35:26.960 --> 3:35:32.720]  terror any act of decency or valor can make you a target let's not forget that this hack was
[3:35:32.720 --> 3:35:39.840]  facilitated by media driven hate mongering directed towards the protesters the demonization
[3:35:39.840 --> 3:35:47.360]  monstering and dehumanization of them as racists homophobes and extremists absurdly claiming with no
[3:35:47.360 --> 3:35:52.960]  evidence whatsoever that they were being controlled by russia then given the veneer of approval by
[3:35:52.960 --> 3:35:59.760]  the trudo regime caught blanche announcing that they had unacceptable opinions this same narrative
[3:35:59.760 --> 3:36:05.920]  was then amplified again by the media after the hacked details of the donors were made public
[3:36:05.920 --> 3:36:12.320]  here again we see the axis of evils state directed discrimination and oppression bolstered by the
[3:36:12.320 --> 3:36:18.320]  media and then inflicted on good people by the foot soldiers of the mob real world harm crafted
[3:36:18.320 --> 3:36:24.640]  by government greenlit by the media and then weaponized by the mobs of social media the very
[3:36:24.640 --> 3:36:31.200]  thing they accuse the freedom convoy of doing hate mongering intolerance violence they're doing to
[3:36:31.200 --> 3:36:36.640]  the freedom convoy and again without the media's feverish campaign of hate and violence none of
[3:36:36.640 --> 3:36:41.760]  this would be happening and you wonder why people don't trust you you wonder why ordinary working
[3:36:41.760 --> 3:36:47.600]  class people despise you when this is what you do to them will you ever have the mental capacity
[3:36:47.600 --> 3:36:57.600]  for a single moment of self-reflection now of course this hack has been claimed the responsibility
[3:36:57.600 --> 3:37:04.000]  the credit has been taken by an individual named aubrey cottle this infamous anonymous hacker who
[3:37:04.000 --> 3:37:10.400]  obviously is so independent liberal and courageous he sides with every regime missive imaginable
[3:37:11.360 --> 3:37:16.320]  via tiktok you've probably seen the video by now it's there up on screen literally
[3:37:16.320 --> 3:37:22.880]  radiating demonic evil energy the kind of behaviorisms mannerisms and ticks that you
[3:37:22.880 --> 3:37:32.000]  would expect in somebody who is completely insane a psychiatric patient he's free on tiktok to
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:38.720]  openly admit that he's a quote cyber terrorist as he gleefully celebrates committing this crime
[3:37:39.520 --> 3:37:44.480]  and he's literally got about a dozen videos on tiktok in which he's saying i'm a cyber terrorist
[3:37:44.480 --> 3:37:49.760]  i'm committing crimes and it's great any action taken against him by tiktok not the last time
[3:37:49.760 --> 3:37:56.400]  i checked this is a social media network that tip the tiktok that bans the mildest political
[3:37:56.400 --> 3:38:03.680]  commentary and yet this guy is free to brag and boast about his evil demonic crimes which he obviously
[3:38:04.240 --> 3:38:12.080]  really enjoys gets demonic energy from on tiktok the most censored social media network in existence
[3:38:12.080 --> 3:38:17.840]  and they do absolutely nothing about it now of course last night we had ill han o more
[3:38:17.840 --> 3:38:24.800]  ill han o more based he actually came out and blasted journalists for exploiting doxing of
[3:38:24.800 --> 3:38:30.400]  freedom convoy supporters came out with a tweet and that was in response to the article i mentioned
[3:38:30.400 --> 3:38:36.320]  there in this video by the author of citizen where they basically went to this cafe owner and said
[3:38:36.320 --> 3:38:41.680]  yeah it may not be very nice that you're getting violent threats and threats from
[3:38:41.680 --> 3:38:48.080]  antifa members to throw bricks at your windows ransack and smash up your business that may not
[3:38:48.080 --> 3:38:54.240]  be very nice but aren't you regretful aren't you the bad person for donating two hundred and fifty
[3:38:54.240 --> 3:39:01.120]  dollars to the canadian truckers they made her out in the story like she was the immoral actor
[3:39:01.120 --> 3:39:07.600]  in the whole situation absolutely incredible and then another otter was citizen journalist
[3:39:07.600 --> 3:39:14.160]  by the way journalism is an intimidating ordinary working class people who send 250 books to a
[3:39:14.160 --> 3:39:20.560]  protest movement why not ask some perhaps some actual questions of people in power that's what
[3:39:20.560 --> 3:39:26.240]  journalism used to be washington washington post today doing the exact same thing so this otter
[3:39:26.240 --> 3:39:33.440]  was citizen editor retweets or quote tweets her colleague at the otter was citizen to try and push
[3:39:33.440 --> 3:39:41.280]  this report which celebrates basically the doxing of this cafe owner ill hanomar responds quote i
[3:39:41.280 --> 3:39:46.080]  failed to see why any journalist felt the need to report on a shop owner making such an insignificant
[3:39:46.080 --> 3:39:51.840]  donation rather than to get them harassed it's unconscionable and journalists need to do better
[3:39:52.560 --> 3:39:58.000]  so it's like that meme of you know the worst person in the world you agree with but props to
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:40:04.800]  ill hanomar she actually came out with a respectable reason based comment but now today cannot canada's
[3:40:04.800 --> 3:40:09.920]  justice minister says trump supporters should worry about having their bank accounts frozen is this
[3:40:09.920 --> 3:40:15.200]  trump supporters in the united states is the canadian government going to have the power
[3:40:15.200 --> 3:40:21.680]  to reach out to banks in america and get accounts of customers in america cancelled well they're
[3:40:21.680 --> 3:40:28.720]  all part of the same system so why not canada's justice minister david lametti says trump supporters
[3:40:28.720 --> 3:40:34.560]  who donated money to the canadian freedom convoy does dangerous extremists should be worried about
[3:40:34.560 --> 3:40:39.760]  having their bank accounts frozen you made the obscene comment during an interview with ctv he
[3:40:39.760 --> 3:40:45.600]  said quote responding to a reporter who's who said you just compared people who may have donated
[3:40:45.600 --> 3:40:49.360]  this to the same people who may be a funding a terrorist by the way this is all with the
[3:40:49.360 --> 3:40:57.120]  background of of course massive unruly fiery violent protest by black lives matter activists
[3:40:57.120 --> 3:41:03.840]  over the past two years an actual extremist violent organization that has carried out assassinations by
[3:41:03.840 --> 3:41:09.360]  its most vehement members that has carried out attempted attempted bombings of police stations
[3:41:09.360 --> 3:41:15.120]  in ferguson whose member as i'm going to get on to in the next segment prominent activists
[3:41:15.120 --> 3:41:21.200]  promoted platformed by the mainstream media literally tried to assassinate a mayoral candidate
[3:41:21.200 --> 3:41:28.160]  in kentucky yeah that organization that the media has uplifted venerated for the past two years
[3:41:28.160 --> 3:41:34.240]  it's okay to donate to them and in fact it's okay to donate bail money to bail out literal
[3:41:34.240 --> 3:41:39.680]  attempted murderers as i'm going to get on to that's all fine but if you give 20 bucks
[3:41:39.680 --> 3:41:44.640]  to the freedom convoy truckers in canada well you're a bad person maybe you're a terrorist
[3:41:44.640 --> 3:41:51.360]  and maybe your bank account should be frozen too absolutely despicable and then there's another
[3:41:51.360 --> 3:41:58.640]  tweet today by this individual from a i think it was a local newspaper in utah indeed it was the
[3:41:59.680 --> 3:42:05.200]  salt lake tribune he said on twitter i've been reaching out to people from utah who appeared
[3:42:05.200 --> 3:42:11.520]  on the leaked canadian trucker donation data again exploiting a criminal hack deliberately
[3:42:11.520 --> 3:42:18.640]  designed to expose people for completely legal completely normal political donations exploiting
[3:42:18.640 --> 3:42:22.800]  a literal crime which is what the mainstream media and what these journalists are doing
[3:42:23.520 --> 3:42:27.200]  he said i've been reaching out to people from utah who appeared on the leaked canadian trucker
[3:42:27.200 --> 3:42:34.560]  donation data who boy some of the replies have been aggressive to put it mildly what do you expect
[3:42:34.560 --> 3:42:42.000]  that's not journalism trying to expose intimidate doc's ordinary people joey in utah for giving 20
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:49.440]  bucks to a protest movement that he supports in canada what reaction do you expect absolutely
[3:42:49.440 --> 3:42:57.440]  despicable once again from the mainstream media summit dot news we'll be back now go away anything

[3:43:17.280 --> 3:43:22.720]  trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes their their transhumanist nightmare vision
[3:43:23.440 --> 3:43:29.360]  suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and

[3:48:05.200 --> 3:48:11.920]  today in kentucky headline black lives matter media darling who allegedly shot politician
[3:48:12.480 --> 3:48:17.040]  and they you know they found him with the gun and the magazines and the uh
[3:48:17.040 --> 3:48:22.720]  mayoral candidate says it was him so we say allegedly but it seems pretty locked tight
[3:48:23.440 --> 3:48:28.320]  black lives matter media darling who allegedly shot politician campaigned against gun violence
[3:48:28.960 --> 3:48:35.360]  oh the irony black lives matter activist quintess brown who previously enjoyed a prominent platform
[3:48:35.360 --> 3:48:41.280]  thanks to legacy media outlets allegedly attempted to shoot dead a politician after campaigning against
[3:48:41.280 --> 3:48:49.760]  gun violence this was a guy who was given such a prominent platform even in the uk by the bbc
[3:48:49.760 --> 3:48:57.440]  giro forks called him there quote go to us black lives matter activist this guy was named as a
[3:48:57.440 --> 3:49:04.560]  rising face by barack obama's foundation in 2019 and previously featured as a venerator
[3:49:04.560 --> 3:49:11.680]  blm speaker on numerous mainstream media news outlets he was indeed one of their own a creature
[3:49:11.680 --> 3:49:18.400]  of that establishment he was also an ardent gun control campaigner who repeatedly spoke out against
[3:49:18.400 --> 3:49:24.560]  gun violence and in fact defying elves which was banned by twitter a couple of days ago
[3:49:24.560 --> 3:49:29.520]  with merely posting other people's tweets and exposing their hypocrisy thankfully they were
[3:49:29.520 --> 3:49:36.560]  back on twitter yesterday pointed out that quintess brown himself wrote an article for the courier
[3:49:36.560 --> 3:49:41.520]  journal headline kentucky's concealed carry law shows your life doesn't matter to gun loving
[3:49:41.520 --> 3:49:47.920]  republicans that's followed up with an article from the same newspaper headlined activist quintess
[3:49:47.920 --> 3:49:55.040]  brown named an attempted shooting of louisville mayor candidate greenberg this uh brave anti
[3:49:55.040 --> 3:50:02.720]  gun violence campaigner who allegedly went on to try and shoot his political rival also tweeted quote
[3:50:02.720 --> 3:50:08.160]  gun violence reveals the interconnected nature of our reality what affects one directly affects
[3:50:08.160 --> 3:50:14.800]  all indirectly especially in our segregated conditions brown's attorney rob egger has attempted
[3:50:14.800 --> 3:50:20.000]  to pin the blame for the alleged shooting on the suspects you guessed it mental health issues
[3:50:20.000 --> 3:50:27.040]  and police say there is no no motive despite the fact that the activist was standing as an independent
[3:50:27.040 --> 3:50:33.760]  candidate for election to the louisville council in district five of the city greenberg the mayoral
[3:50:33.760 --> 3:50:39.440]  candidate who he tried to presumably allegedly assassinate said quote we asked if we could
[3:50:39.440 --> 3:50:45.280]  help him and he pulled out a gun this is the brave anti gun violence campaigner aimed it directly at
[3:50:45.280 --> 3:50:49.600]  me in open fire i was fortunate that one of my brave teammates slammed the door shut they were
[3:50:49.600 --> 3:50:54.720]  able to throw some desks on top of the door and the suspect fled he said despite one bullet coming
[3:50:54.720 --> 3:50:59.680]  so close that grazed my sweater on my shirt no one was physically harmed so he fled the scene
[3:51:00.640 --> 3:51:09.040]  and they later found this uh brave anti gun violence campaigner with a uh nine millimeter
[3:51:09.040 --> 3:51:15.280]  and a bunch of uh bullets so it seems like he may have been involved and then of course he had this
[3:51:15.280 --> 3:51:23.040]  video where the local louisville bailout fund for violent black lives matter people and antifa
[3:51:23.040 --> 3:51:30.080]  posted a check for one hundred thousand dollars to bail out this suspected attempted murderer
[3:51:30.640 --> 3:51:36.240]  again because black lives matter is so peaceful they only engage in mostly peaceful somewhat
[3:51:36.240 --> 3:51:41.520]  fiery but mostly peaceful demonstrations they don't cause two billion dollars worth of damage
[3:51:41.520 --> 3:51:47.120]  they don't attempt to bomb police stations they weren't literally founded by people who said their
[3:51:47.120 --> 3:51:53.040]  inspiration for founding black lives matter was a sartre chicor a convicted cop killing domestic
[3:51:53.040 --> 3:51:59.120]  terrorist who is still in exile on the run none of that's real they're a peaceful uh liberal
[3:51:59.120 --> 3:52:06.880]  organization let's go to this video now because we had the super bowl back last weekend there was a
[3:52:06.880 --> 3:52:13.280]  lot of uh contrived diversity during the super bowl ads and now it's become so extreme that even
[3:52:13.280 --> 3:52:20.160]  redditors are finding the forced tv diversity a little bit weird a little bit too much here's the
[3:52:20.160 --> 3:52:26.640]  clip when even members of reddit are expressing surprise at the contrived level of diversity
[3:52:26.640 --> 3:52:32.000]  on television you know some things up yeah the left wing dumps the fire with an appetite for
[3:52:32.000 --> 3:52:37.440]  censorship that dwarfs that of many autocratic countries is on fire with discussion of the
[3:52:37.440 --> 3:52:43.120]  dodgy demographics that were on display during the super bowl commercials a reddit user recorded
[3:52:43.120 --> 3:52:50.080]  the race of all 433 actors who featured in the 2022 super bowl ads whites and hispanics were
[3:52:50.080 --> 3:52:54.960]  underrepresented compared to their population percentage while black people were over represented
[3:52:54.960 --> 3:53:01.280]  by about three to one the black population according to the 2020 us census is around 12.1
[3:53:01.280 --> 3:53:07.440]  percent and yet they featured in nearly 40 percent of super bowl commercials who cares about what race
[3:53:07.440 --> 3:53:12.400]  people in the super bowl commercials were or apparently judging by the responses to this thread
[3:53:12.400 --> 3:53:18.720]  a lot of redditors care the vast majority of whom are certainly not right wing also interracial couples
[3:53:18.720 --> 3:53:22.560]  seem to be over represented compared to their prevalence in the population which would be
[3:53:22.560 --> 3:53:27.600]  more defensible if it were actually consistent about promoting dating diversity instead of being
[3:53:27.600 --> 3:53:32.880]  weirdly selective about only showing black male white female and white male Asian female couples
[3:53:32.880 --> 3:53:38.160]  as the only two acceptable combinations omg yes this drives me crazy so i'm not the only one seeing
[3:53:38.160 --> 3:53:42.480]  that shit it's really weird the funniest shit is when they only feature a single family but they
[3:53:42.480 --> 3:53:47.280]  want max diversity and we're somehow supposed to ignore the fact that a white dad and a black mom
[3:53:47.280 --> 3:53:52.560]  gave birth to an asian girl and an arabic boy in the uk i'd estimate that 75 percent of commercials
[3:53:52.560 --> 3:53:56.720]  feature interracial couples whereas the amount of mixed race couples in real life is probably about
[3:53:56.720 --> 3:54:02.160]  15 percent i don't know why they do this but it's very noticeable since the blm movement got big
[3:54:02.160 --> 3:54:06.480]  it's very strange for people that live in areas like wales and scotland that are around 95 percent
[3:54:06.480 --> 3:54:11.920]  white to see that every advert on tv exclusively has people of color only do the marketing people
[3:54:11.920 --> 3:54:17.040]  know there is an entire country outside of london feels like it's got to the point of parody now the
[3:54:17.040 --> 3:54:22.160]  uk is 87 percent white british something like seven percent asian british i believe the black
[3:54:22.160 --> 3:54:27.200]  population is like three percent or something it's therefore amazing how prominent they are in
[3:54:27.200 --> 3:54:33.760]  adverts and so on companies are now staffed to the gills with diversity and inclusion officers
[3:54:33.760 --> 3:54:39.680]  and the true meaning of diversity is no white people we're not included it's somewhat odd that
[3:54:39.680 --> 3:54:44.400]  given the black population of america isn't expanding at all so it's not even like it's a
[3:54:44.400 --> 3:54:50.400]  prescriptive form of social engineering mixed race relationships are also still quite rare
[3:54:50.400 --> 3:54:55.120]  but if you only took your information from tv commercials you'd think half the population
[3:54:55.120 --> 3:55:01.760]  was in one but by significantly reducing the presence of the dreaded whiteness on television
[3:55:01.760 --> 3:55:08.800]  and in the culture generally wokeism can realize its crt agenda of disempowering white people by
[3:55:08.800 --> 3:55:13.520]  subtly convincing them that their presence isn't welcome and that their whiteness is
[3:55:13.520 --> 3:55:19.680]  something to be ashamed of and when even redditors have started to twig that something very bizarre
[3:55:19.680 --> 3:55:27.360]  is going on chances are that something pretty bizarre is going on now let's continue on that
[3:55:27.360 --> 3:55:31.840]  theme because there's actually a couple of good news stories here at the tail end of the show
[3:55:32.560 --> 3:55:38.800]  this is out of remixed uk woke teachers banned from promoting blm and left-wing political bias
[3:55:38.800 --> 3:55:45.840]  in education crackdown now according to the 1996 education act in the uk teachers aren't supposed to
[3:55:45.840 --> 3:55:51.760]  promote any political viewpoint but now they've been specifically banned from promoting the agenda
[3:55:51.760 --> 3:55:58.000]  of the black lives matter movement yes this is an actual rebellion against crt in the uk
[3:55:58.000 --> 3:56:02.800]  and have been born not to push left-wing political bias about the british empire and historical
[3:56:02.800 --> 3:56:09.280]  figures onto children without providing full historical context so they have to take what
[3:56:09.280 --> 3:56:16.160]  british political figures like winston churchill are best known for their actual positive traits
[3:56:16.160 --> 3:56:22.960]  and teach that primarily to children without none of this woke crt crap that oh but winston
[3:56:22.960 --> 3:56:28.400]  churchill was racist because of comments he made 150 years ago under the new guidance handed down
[3:56:28.400 --> 3:56:33.840]  teachers will not be permitted to teach children one-sided accounts of british historical figures
[3:56:33.840 --> 3:56:41.120]  that is good news also woke psychodrama causing harmful division in western societies that is the
[3:56:41.120 --> 3:56:47.360]  uk conservative party co-chairman oliver dowden speaking out against that then we have this
[3:56:48.080 --> 3:56:54.640]  how low can it go cnn records worse ratings in eight years they continue to plummet and wonder
[3:56:54.640 --> 3:57:00.000]  why no one trusts them as they again become involved in the doxing and outing of people who
[3:57:00.000 --> 3:57:05.280]  donate to the canadian truckers cnn hit a new low last week failing to average half a million
[3:57:05.280 --> 3:57:09.920]  viewers in a day meaning the network registered its lowest ratings in the past eight years
[3:57:10.480 --> 3:57:16.720]  even in prime time cnn couldn't top half a million viewers averaging just 491 000 they
[3:57:16.720 --> 3:57:24.960]  managed to scrape 444 000 total day viewers a level not seen since 2015 they're collapsing
[3:57:24.960 --> 3:57:30.480]  they're striking out they're becoming even more desperate to portray the half of the american
[3:57:30.480 --> 3:57:36.480]  population as dangerous extremists the dhs is coming out and saying that alternative narratives
[3:57:36.480 --> 3:57:42.560]  are a terrorist threat the establishment is a blind panic and it's fantastic to see war room is next
[3:57:42.560 --> 3:57:59.040]  summit on news don't go away from the words of chuck pollinic's fight club dear globalist leaders
[3:57:59.040 --> 3:58:05.120]  of the great reset the people you're trying to step on we're everyone you depend on we're the people
[3:58:05.120 --> 3:58:10.640]  who do your laundry and cook your food and serve your dinner we make your bed we guard you while
[3:58:10.640 --> 3:58:16.960]  you're asleep we drive the ambulances we direct your call we are cooks and we are taxi drivers
[3:58:16.960 --> 3:58:22.160]  and we know everything about you we process your insurance claims and credit card charges
[3:58:22.720 --> 3:58:28.240]  we control every part of your life we are the middle children of history raised by television
[3:58:28.240 --> 3:58:34.880]  to believe that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars but we won't and we're just learning
[3:58:34.880 --> 3:58:42.960]  this fact so don't with us support independent media at info or store com
[3:58:46.320 --> 3:58:52.400]  there is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class
[3:58:53.120 --> 3:59:00.400]  not in communist china not in mexico not in the united states not anywhere is there a real study
[3:59:00.400 --> 3:59:06.000]  of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design the large central banks that basically
[3:59:06.000 --> 3:59:12.400]  control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look into say the anglo-american
[3:59:12.400 --> 3:59:16.880]  establishment the sound of the builder bird group the trilateral commission the united nations
[3:59:16.880 --> 3:59:23.040]  the whole project of the ross shawls of the rock folks until 10 years ago the media said the control
[3:59:23.040 --> 3:59:27.680]  corporate media the builder bird group didn't exist well now the builder bird group is public
[3:59:27.680 --> 3:59:33.280]  its former head he's shown the steering committee is called schwaab and he has set up the great
[3:59:33.280 --> 3:59:38.560]  reset in global government and if as a liberty movement worldwide we don't address the globalist
[3:59:38.560 --> 3:59:43.280]  head on about the second thing or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover we don't
[3:59:43.280 --> 3:59:51.760]  have a shot we do expose them we can beat em easily if you are receiving this transmission
[3:59:51.760 --> 4:00:01.760]  you are the resistance
