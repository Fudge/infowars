[00:00.000 --> 00:08.840]  Attorney Generals from 20 conservative states are threatening legal action against the Department
[00:08.840 --> 00:14.200]  of Homeland Security's newly formed Disinformation Governance Board, which they said will have
[00:14.200 --> 00:18.840]  a chilling effect on freedom of expression and described it as un-American.
[00:18.840 --> 00:21.640]  Unconstitutional would be the word I would use.
[00:21.640 --> 00:27.040]  Now, the good news is that almost all the big tech platforms now acknowledge some responsibility
[00:27.040 --> 00:32.120]  for content on their platforms, and they're investing in large teams of people to monitor
[00:32.120 --> 00:33.120]  it.
[00:33.120 --> 00:39.680]  While content moderation can limit the distribution of clearly dangerous content, it doesn't go
[00:39.680 --> 00:40.680]  far enough.
[00:40.680 --> 00:46.080]  This megacrow is really the most extreme political organization that's existed in American
[00:46.080 --> 00:47.080]  history.
[00:47.080 --> 00:52.120]  If it were that simple, it would merely be irony that the Biden administration, led by
[00:52.120 --> 00:58.400]  its chronic serial fabricator in chief, is just going to bypass that worthless old First
[00:58.400 --> 01:05.800]  Amendment and set up an Orwellian Ministry of Truth led by esteemed disinformation regurgitator
[01:05.800 --> 01:06.800]  Nina Jankowitz.
[01:06.800 --> 01:12.840]  So, what I'm encouraging individuals to do in particular, just your normal average everyday
[01:12.840 --> 01:19.400]  citizen, is to practice informational distancing, where recognizing that disinformation and misinformation
[01:19.400 --> 01:22.680]  often run on emotional manipulation.
[01:22.680 --> 01:28.000]  When you feel your emotions rising to just walk away from your device for a little bit,
[01:28.000 --> 01:31.880]  let yourself cool down, and then start to consider the source.
[01:31.880 --> 01:37.080]  Why does that particular source have an interest in emotionally manipulating you?
[01:37.080 --> 01:40.960]  But we're going to begin tonight with that alleged terror plot and the chilling plan.
[01:40.960 --> 01:44.480]  The FBI says it stopped before it could be carried out.
[01:44.480 --> 01:48.320]  A plan to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and then what they were planning
[01:48.320 --> 01:49.680]  to do to her.
[01:49.680 --> 01:54.800]  Thirteen suspects arrested, including seven alleged members of a right-wing militia group.
[01:54.800 --> 01:59.200]  The local four defenders first told you the men charged in the plot to kidnap Governor
[01:59.200 --> 02:05.320]  Whitmer say the men who train them the entire time were undercover FBI agents.
[02:05.320 --> 02:12.400]  Now, a new court filing obtained by the defenders, filed by so-called ringleader Adam Fox, says
[02:12.400 --> 02:18.800]  the paid FBI informants were also the ones to come up with the plan to kidnap the governor
[02:18.800 --> 02:21.120]  and attack her summer home.
[02:21.120 --> 02:25.920]  Jankiewicz has praised the debunked dossier author Christopher Steele, and vehemently
[02:25.920 --> 02:31.360]  claimed that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation.
[02:31.360 --> 02:36.960]  But Jankiewicz's manic zealotry is far more complicated than what appears on the surface.
[02:36.960 --> 02:51.200]  Jankiewicz's resume reads like a quintessential job application to the Biden-Ukrainian Corruption
[02:51.200 --> 02:57.600]  Corporation, an organization hell-bent on New World Order Russia regime change fueled
[02:57.600 --> 03:00.400]  by the fleecing of the American taxpayer.
[03:00.400 --> 03:04.120]  In 2010, Jankiewicz attended a university in Russia.
[03:04.120 --> 03:09.960]  In 2017, she was a Fulbright fellow in Kiev, working alongside the Foreign Ministry of
[03:09.960 --> 03:10.960]  Ukraine.
[03:10.960 --> 03:17.640]  She has also served as a disinformation fellow at the Treasonous Woodrow Wilson Center and
[03:17.640 --> 03:23.640]  as supervisor of the Russia and Belarus programs at the National Democratic Institute.
[03:23.640 --> 03:29.400]  Republicans are criticizing your decision, the administration's decision to choose Nina
[03:29.400 --> 03:32.320]  Jankiewicz to lead this disinformation board.
[03:32.320 --> 03:35.200]  They say she is not somebody who is neutral.
[03:35.200 --> 03:36.200]  Your response?
[03:36.200 --> 03:40.640]  Evidently qualified a renowned expert in the field of disinformation.
[03:40.640 --> 03:41.640]  And neutral?
[03:41.640 --> 03:42.640]  Absolutely so.
[03:42.640 --> 03:47.640]  Honoring is really quite ferocious, it's when a hoax detects the lies and makes them sound
[03:47.640 --> 03:48.640]  for code.
[03:48.640 --> 03:53.640]  She's by saying them in Congress or a mainstream outlet so disinformation's origins are slightly
[03:53.640 --> 03:55.360]  less atrocious.
[03:55.360 --> 04:19.640]  And as the multi-millionaire Wall Street leaching Democratic Party eggs on World War 3 and funnels
[04:19.640 --> 04:27.160]  in billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars to one of the most corrupt countries on Earth, Ukraine.
[04:27.160 --> 04:32.160]  Corruption blatantly tied to the Biden family, Jankiewicz fronts an effort mirroring the
[04:32.160 --> 04:36.520]  totalitarianism being wielded on Ukrainian dissenters.
[04:36.520 --> 04:42.160]  An effort that would make the Ukrainian Goebbels worshipping Azov battalion very proud.
[04:42.160 --> 04:45.760]  Ask yourself, what is the end game for a Ministry of Truth?
[04:45.760 --> 04:48.280]  No, don't do that, your door's being kicked in.
[04:48.280 --> 04:50.280]  John Bound reporting.
[04:50.280 --> 04:55.640]  We'll be back for this live Tuesday edition.
[04:55.640 --> 05:00.640]  Stay with us.

[05:47.440 --> 05:55.760]  It's only running for one week, MyPillow.com forward slash Alex or 800-675-4614 and thank
[05:55.760 --> 06:22.120]  you for shopping America and keeping us on the air.
[06:25.760 --> 06:49.560]  Here we are, my friends, on this Tuesday, May 10th, worldwide broadcast, I'm your host
[06:49.560 --> 06:50.560]  Alex Jones.
[06:50.560 --> 06:54.600]  I'm very honored to be here with you again today and I'm going to open the phones up
[06:54.600 --> 06:58.640]  throughout the full transmission until the fourth hour.
[06:58.640 --> 07:03.440]  So the next three hours will be open phones yet again on any subject or any topic you
[07:03.440 --> 07:10.240]  want to raise, though specifically I'd like to try to keep it to news topics if we could
[07:10.240 --> 07:17.440]  and not so much in Info Wars centric calls where we just talk about Info Wars.
[07:17.440 --> 07:21.800]  That's great for callers and great for folks that are really super fans, but we have a
[07:21.800 --> 07:26.560]  lot of people tuning in on AM and FM stations across the country that want to hear the news
[07:26.560 --> 07:30.560]  and the information and not just talk about the inner workings of Info Wars.
[07:30.560 --> 07:35.080]  But if you have questions, if you have comments, if you disagree, you agree, you want to give
[07:35.080 --> 07:39.840]  your view on something, it will be a free for all.
[07:39.840 --> 07:44.960]  I'm just telling you what my preference is when you call in that it be on one of the
[07:44.960 --> 07:47.200]  subjects and that'd be great.
[07:47.200 --> 07:50.200]  Let me get into some of the subjects we've got here.
[07:50.200 --> 07:55.040]  Maybe the abortion topic going into overdrive right now with the left intensifying their
[07:55.040 --> 07:58.400]  bullying and terror campaigns.
[07:58.400 --> 08:04.320]  We have giant escalations by Biden now with 40 billion more to Ukraine.
[08:04.320 --> 08:09.760]  Biden speeds up military aid, Ukraine drawing U.S. deeper into war, New York Times headline
[08:09.760 --> 08:12.640]  is actually accurate.
[08:12.640 --> 08:17.760]  Vladimir Putin gave an incredible World War II Victory Day speech and it's by saying
[08:17.760 --> 08:24.000]  incredible, it was incredibly thought provoking the things he was saying and incredibly dangerous
[08:24.000 --> 08:25.000]  as well.
[08:25.000 --> 08:29.600]  We've got some clips of that coming up where he said the West has been taken over by a
[08:29.600 --> 08:36.440]  bunch of satanic demons and the cancel culture is the new authoritarian 1984 system.
[08:36.440 --> 08:42.680]  It's just wild to see an authoritarian state able to criticize the United States because
[08:42.680 --> 08:48.800]  we become more authoritarian and more evil when it comes to the pedophilia, the sexualization
[08:48.800 --> 08:51.720]  of children than they have ever been.
[08:51.720 --> 08:54.920]  We've really lost the moral high ground.
[08:54.920 --> 08:59.640]  It's frightening and we have all that information.
[08:59.640 --> 09:04.000]  The first big story I want to hit, I'll cover it next segment but I want to just point out
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.440]  this side, I think it's the biggest story and then we'll tell it next segment.
[09:07.440 --> 09:14.280]  I'm going to move on to some of the other reports here in a moment, is Saki and Biden
[09:14.280 --> 09:22.240]  are now trying to blame conservatives and Trump and Republicans for the inflation and
[09:22.240 --> 09:27.640]  the gas prices when, yeah, you can blame Republicans for going along with overspending
[09:27.640 --> 09:33.600]  and printing over the years but under the Democrats, they put the pedal to the metal
[09:33.600 --> 09:39.320]  and then cut off the energy supplies and the pipelines so they're trying to do it on purpose
[09:39.320 --> 09:46.880]  as their club of Rome globalist policy of the post-industrial world to control collapse
[09:46.880 --> 09:53.400]  so it's simply astounding to watch the economy go up in flames and massive shortages of everything
[09:53.400 --> 10:03.320]  from gasoline to baby formula and food distribution centers and food processing plants blowing
[10:03.320 --> 10:05.840]  up and burning on a daily basis.
[10:05.840 --> 10:10.840]  The border completely wide open, images of hundreds of thousands, tens of thousands
[10:10.840 --> 10:14.200]  at a time flooding into the southern border.
[10:14.200 --> 10:18.720]  We covered it three, four years ago, it was big news, now it's just, oh yeah, the borders
[10:18.720 --> 10:24.000]  completely wide open and the third world is collapsing under the weight of two years of
[10:24.000 --> 10:32.720]  lockdown into us so America is being turned into Venezuela both literally and figuratively
[10:32.720 --> 10:40.600]  and it's all part of a larger globalist plan they admit.
[10:40.600 --> 10:46.480]  So that's coming up and then we've got incredible tidbits like this.
[10:46.480 --> 10:55.160]  I remember warning you about the fact that a lot of top globalists were involved in Ancestry.com
[10:55.160 --> 11:03.000]  and the other big DNA harvesting company and I told you it was being sold to the Chinese
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.120]  because big tech has no regard for the law, anything they do, whatever they want, they're
[11:07.120 --> 11:13.120]  the deep state, they just have a blank check and at the top of the pyramid propping up
[11:13.120 --> 11:17.880]  China and the whole globalist system is the consortium of private banks that own Blackrock
[11:17.880 --> 11:24.880]  and Vanguard, well now Blackstone to acquire Ancestry.com for $4.7 million and ownership
[11:24.880 --> 11:31.120]  of your DNA suckers and I'm not calling you a sucker, they are and you say well what do
[11:31.120 --> 11:32.120]  I have to hide?
[11:32.120 --> 11:36.960]  Well no, now they'll patent your DNA and later claim they own it when you try to get any
[11:36.960 --> 11:44.520]  type of gene therapy so they're mapping out the whole future right now.
[11:44.520 --> 11:50.840]  We had 23andMe has sold the rights to develop a drug based on its users, DNA, the Supreme
[11:50.840 --> 11:54.800]  Court's rule that when you give up samples and things you don't own it because you don't
[11:54.800 --> 12:01.680]  stand up for yourself so this is all a giant harvesting power grab.
[12:01.680 --> 12:08.120]  We also have, speak of the devil, the covid stack is incredible, it just gets more insane
[12:08.120 --> 12:18.360]  by the day, Stephen Colbert has had four shots and he's had covid three times, twice in
[12:18.360 --> 12:25.040]  the last month, you see the more boosters old Stephen gets, the sicker he gets in all
[12:25.040 --> 12:30.040]  the studies actually show it gives you covid and old Stephen ain't looking so good, he's
[12:30.040 --> 12:34.720]  aged a lot, some of all of us under this bio attack, whether you get it naturally or from
[12:34.720 --> 12:39.360]  the shot but all the studies show by the third or fourth shot man you are not going to be
[12:39.360 --> 12:45.640]  doing too hot and there's other big studies out proving massive increases in heart attacks
[12:45.640 --> 12:52.880]  and strokes in people that have had the shots, whether it's J&J, AstraZeneca, Moderna or Pfizer
[12:52.880 --> 13:01.320]  they were all told by the working group run by Dazik and Gates and Fauci, months before
[13:01.320 --> 13:05.640]  they announced that covid was released, it's in the emails, here's the sequence, here's
[13:05.640 --> 13:13.440]  the virus, start making a vaccine for this, that's how they go oh my gosh, Pfizer said
[13:13.440 --> 13:21.200]  one week after we got the sample we already had the vaccine, yeah right, right sure, which
[13:21.200 --> 13:26.160]  again creates the spike protein in your body, orders your body to create what is killing
[13:26.160 --> 13:32.200]  you, unbelievable and yeah, it orders your body to create it so your body recognizes
[13:32.200 --> 13:37.680]  it and fights it and then causes an autoimmune response as well, so there you go, you talk
[13:37.680 --> 13:44.320]  about useful idiots marching themselves off the edge of a cliff in the club of Rome that
[13:44.320 --> 13:49.440]  was a public arm of the Bilderberg group and now the Davos group is taking over for it,
[13:49.440 --> 13:56.560]  we have the head of the organization in just a short clip we'll be playing in the fourth
[13:56.560 --> 14:01.640]  segment about 15-20 minutes where he admits yeah we're going to cut the resources off
[14:01.640 --> 14:08.280]  and hopefully you peacefully just roll over and die, that's what so frustrating is we
[14:08.280 --> 14:13.400]  cover what the actual controllers are saying, when Schwab and Hurari are saying you'll own
[14:13.400 --> 14:16.600]  nothing, you'll have nothing, you have no free will, you have no freedom, we're going
[14:16.600 --> 14:22.120]  to kill you, we are gods, we are gods and they're like weird crazy looking chicken neck, pencil
[14:22.120 --> 14:29.920]  neck, bug-eyed nuts who just toddle around on stage announcing they're god, so if you
[14:29.920 --> 14:38.000]  want to hear from these folks, we will let you hear from them here today, they bust another
[14:38.000 --> 14:45.400]  big Republican slash Democrat operative trying to have sex with an underage girl under 12,
[14:45.400 --> 14:50.040]  there's a big buddy with the Clintons and Jeffrey Epstein of course, we have just got
[14:50.040 --> 14:57.080]  so much to obviously hit here today, please don't forget, only way we reach new people
[14:57.080 --> 15:02.440]  under the massive censorship is when you remember to say hey, you know the forbidden show, the
[15:02.440 --> 15:06.120]  thing you're not supposed to hear that warned about so much that's unfolded, well he's
[15:06.120 --> 15:10.200]  covering what's coming next and how to stop it, we need to tune into it, need to research
[15:10.200 --> 15:13.480]  it, need to prove it for yourself, need to do your own research and then need to share
[15:13.480 --> 15:18.600]  it with others and tell them to do the same and tell them to do the same and create the

[17:42.400 --> 17:45.680]  I want to thank all of you that have donated, I want to encourage those of you out there
[17:45.680 --> 17:50.200]  that want to support Freedom to take action now and be part of the global awakening, the

[18:00.000 --> 18:04.600]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand Infowars, I've been on the air a couple
[18:04.600 --> 18:09.640]  of years but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show and I wanted
[18:09.640 --> 18:13.360]  to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge the globalist
[18:13.360 --> 18:19.000]  and it was a t-shirt I designed the first one, Mass Murderers Agreed Gun Control Works
[18:19.000 --> 18:23.480]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew, that's our oldest design
[18:23.480 --> 18:25.080]  and we're still selling it.
[18:25.080 --> 18:29.920]  We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions because whatever
[18:29.920 --> 18:34.960]  stock we've got in, that's it, we're selling everything out to find the operation to get
[18:34.960 --> 18:38.960]  rid of inventory, we'll still have some t-shirts in the future, they'll just be limited editions
[18:38.960 --> 18:43.200]  and short runs, so if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last
[18:43.200 --> 18:48.880]  team on what I almost forgot, we're selling them all at cost at InfowarsStore.com.
[18:48.880 --> 18:54.600]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts,
[18:54.600 --> 18:58.760]  designer shirts, they're all selling at cost, InfowarsStore.com.
[19:54.600 --> 20:14.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:14.280 --> 20:25.920]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex
[20:25.920 --> 20:26.920]  Jones.
[20:26.920 --> 20:33.000]  And the answer to 1984 is definitely 1776, so it's good to know your enemy and it's
[20:33.000 --> 20:39.800]  good to know where their mindset and their systems of thought come from and so let's
[20:39.800 --> 20:45.560]  do some of that here together today and understand why they're incrementally turning off the
[20:45.560 --> 20:51.600]  infrastructure, why they're incrementally dumbing down the population, why they're by degree
[20:51.600 --> 20:58.840]  poisoning us and dividing and conquering us and that's because it's a pretext for them
[20:58.840 --> 21:05.640]  to get total control and power to claim the earth has reached its carrying capacity and
[21:05.640 --> 21:10.920]  there are too many people and so they've got to bring in a world dictatorship and I'm
[21:10.920 --> 21:16.120]  about to play you them saying that at the World Economic Forum to save the earth from
[21:16.120 --> 21:25.720]  the humans and have a peaceful extermination of at least 90% of the world population.
[21:25.720 --> 21:31.120]  Now Dennis Meadows, Paul Ehrlich and John P. Holdren all wrote books, some of them they
[21:31.120 --> 21:36.360]  co-authored like Limits to Growth and The Population Bomb back in the 60s, they were
[21:36.360 --> 21:42.520]  all funded by the Club of Rome and the Bilderberg Group on record and he's a World Economic
[21:42.520 --> 21:50.160]  Forum Fellow, he's been on the board and he's a big professor here in the United States
[21:50.160 --> 21:59.120]  at MIT and other facilities and here he is talking about a dictatorship to exterminate
[21:59.120 --> 22:03.800]  you and your family.
[22:03.800 --> 22:13.840]  This is not, this is not some minority of these people that are saying this and that
[22:13.840 --> 22:24.080]  are talking like this, this is the entire mindset of these people, this is their worldview,
[22:24.080 --> 22:33.240]  this is their religion, this is what they are, this is who they are and it's their mission
[22:33.240 --> 22:35.480]  and really it's the excuse for their power and control.
[22:35.480 --> 22:39.520]  Now you can have a debate about whether the earth is overpopulated and certainly in some
[22:39.520 --> 22:45.520]  areas it is and certainly society's broken down and humanity's lost its way but the
[22:45.520 --> 22:50.620]  idea that we're going to let the very worst greedy out of control people that follow none
[22:50.620 --> 22:59.080]  of their own advice and who are super predators sell us on exterminating 90% of our fellow
[22:59.080 --> 23:04.600]  humans you know they're not going to stop with them and in fact when you get deeper
[23:04.600 --> 23:08.640]  into their teachings and into their mindsets they actually say we're getting rid of all
[23:08.640 --> 23:16.080]  humans, we're gods, we're merging with machines and the people that go to these events and
[23:16.080 --> 23:23.840]  get recruited into it who then get pushed for governor, prime minister, congress, parliament
[23:23.840 --> 23:28.200]  they're led in on you're the ruling elite, you have the high test scores, you've got
[23:28.200 --> 23:34.160]  good genetics we say, you're a sociopath and so now you're part of the club and then they
[23:34.160 --> 23:39.840]  carry out the eugenics and the sterilization and the racial division and the deindustrialization
[23:39.840 --> 23:44.960]  and the attack on everybody else so that we will peacefully in quotes disintegrate and
[23:44.960 --> 23:53.880]  fall apart, you can go back to Sir Thomas Malthus 300 years ago and he wrote books and
[23:53.880 --> 24:01.740]  scientific papers predicting by 1800 a total collapse of the planet's carrying capacity
[24:01.740 --> 24:08.000]  if they didn't kill the poor people by poisoning their food and by herding them into tiny compact
[24:08.000 --> 24:14.320]  apartments where they would all get each other sick and die from not getting sunlight and
[24:14.320 --> 24:24.800]  he himself was picking a lot of this up from Plato that talked about similar things so
[24:24.800 --> 24:30.200]  people need to know the governing system that is attacking them and that is coming after
[24:30.200 --> 24:39.160]  them so here is club of Rome member, here is Bilderberg group attendee, here is world
[24:39.160 --> 24:48.160]  economic forum fellow, Dennis Meadows very calmly, psychotically talking about exterminating
[24:48.160 --> 24:57.760]  the majority of the public and putting out the false idea that we must destroy humanity
[24:57.760 --> 25:02.200]  but of course he's been self-appointed to carry that out, he's not going to go anywhere,
[25:02.200 --> 25:03.200]  here it is.
[25:03.200 --> 25:10.080]  So far, globally we are so far above the population and the consumption levels which can be supported
[25:10.080 --> 25:14.160]  by this planet that I know in one way or another it's going to come back down so I don't hope
[25:14.160 --> 25:17.200]  to avoid that.
[25:17.200 --> 25:32.400]  I hope that it can occur in a civil way and I mean civil in a special way, peaceful, peace
[25:32.400 --> 25:39.320]  doesn't mean that everybody is happy but it means that conflict isn't solved through
[25:39.320 --> 25:49.720]  violence, through force but rather in other ways and so that's what I hope for that we
[25:49.720 --> 26:03.680]  can, the planet can support something like a billion people, maybe two billion depending
[26:03.680 --> 26:08.640]  on how much liberty and how much material consumption you want to have, if you want more
[26:08.640 --> 26:15.680]  liberty and more consumption you have to have fewer people and conversely you can have more
[26:15.680 --> 26:22.280]  people, I mean we can even have eight or nine billion probably if we have a very strong
[26:22.280 --> 26:27.360]  dictatorship which is smart, unfortunately you never have smart dictatorships, they're
[26:27.360 --> 26:32.240]  always stupid but if you have a smart dictatorship and a low standard of living you can have
[26:32.240 --> 26:36.600]  it but we want to have freedom and we want to have a high sense so we're going to have
[26:36.600 --> 26:41.040]  a billion people and we're now at seven so we have to get back down.
[26:41.040 --> 26:47.000]  I hope that this can be slow, relatively slow and that it can be done in a way which is
[26:47.000 --> 26:56.000]  relatively equal so that people share the experience and they don't have a few rich
[26:56.000 --> 27:00.320]  trying to force everybody else to deal with that, so those are my hopes, I mean these
[27:00.320 --> 27:08.440]  are pretty pessimistic hopes but that's…
[27:08.440 --> 27:12.960]  So that's the standard operating procedure of these people, they run the planet and they're
[27:12.960 --> 27:17.600]  cutting off resources and cutting off clean innovations because they really just want
[27:17.600 --> 27:24.080]  to be able to play God and they're targeting the smartest and most informed people we've
[27:24.080 --> 27:29.080]  got with the fluoride, with the atrazine, with all the chemicals because they don't
[27:29.080 --> 27:34.560]  want competition, these are the worst of the worst and you heard what he said in that little
[27:34.560 --> 27:41.400]  short two minute clip, he said we need to depopulate them peacefully and he goes I don't
[27:41.400 --> 27:46.720]  mean there won't be death and violence, no I mean there's not big conflict, they don't
[27:46.720 --> 27:51.360]  want governments figuring this out or a country or a group saying we don't want to be killed
[27:51.360 --> 27:54.440]  and not going along with it because everybody will notice they're not going to be dying
[27:54.440 --> 28:00.040]  slowly from the chemicals and the shots and the 5G countries that don't do this so you've
[28:00.040 --> 28:03.800]  got to make sure everybody goes along and then he said there are ways to peacefully
[28:03.800 --> 28:08.920]  depopulate, through the food, through the water, through the shots, electromagnetically
[28:08.920 --> 28:13.400]  and that's what they talk about, hitting you with a cocktail of attacks so it's hard to
[28:13.400 --> 28:21.200]  pinpoint exactly what's killing you, they need to get the population down so they can
[28:21.200 --> 28:26.360]  keep those that are left in the Play-Dohs Cave where they can project their reality
[28:26.360 --> 28:34.120]  on the wall and then you simply accept it, very very frustrating to see them in countless
[28:34.120 --> 28:38.280]  clips every day coming out of their rat holes, talking about how they're going to kill everybody
[28:38.280 --> 28:41.280]  and then you can open the New York Times up and Jones is dangerous, he claims there's
[28:41.280 --> 28:45.560]  a global plot to depopulate the earth and the next page in the New York Times says
[28:45.560 --> 28:50.840]  it's time to start censoring and depopulating and the end of humanity is a needed thing
[28:50.840 --> 28:54.240]  that everyone that's going along with this is pretending they won't be destroyed as
[28:54.240 --> 29:00.000]  well, stay with us.
[29:00.000 --> 29:04.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ultra 12, the highest quality B12 you're going to find on the market

[33:08.720 --> 33:23.720]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:23.720 --> 33:34.520]  Coming up next segment, I'm going to get into the fraud that is covered in 19 and what it
[33:34.520 --> 33:44.040]  really is, a synthetic replicating nanotech cooked up in a lab by scientists working directly
[33:44.040 --> 33:49.840]  for Barack Hussein Obama, and so when you get sick from it, when your family gets sick
[33:49.840 --> 33:53.880]  and dies from it, just remember, they told you there's too many of us and they're going
[33:53.880 --> 33:57.800]  to kill all of us if we buy into it, because here's the deal.
[33:57.800 --> 34:03.360]  They're beta testing with COVID-19 that's mother's milk compared to what they've got
[34:03.360 --> 34:06.920]  on the shelf, and if they think they can get away with launching something much bigger
[34:06.920 --> 34:11.840]  and much worse, they'll stay locked down and die at home and things won't get out of control
[34:11.840 --> 34:16.280]  and they won't get blamed, they will wipe you out.
[34:16.280 --> 34:20.880]  I've been on here 28 years and for 28 years I've been saying a controlled bio-weapon
[34:20.880 --> 34:25.520]  release is coming, but first they would have limited releases to practice lockdowns of
[34:25.520 --> 34:31.880]  the control grid, because that's just common sense is how they do it, and we've got their
[34:31.880 --> 34:36.400]  white papers where they talk about it, but before we even got their white papers, I
[34:36.400 --> 34:40.640]  had analyzed and reverse engineered their plan.
[34:40.640 --> 34:43.440]  Anybody can do this, they're rich, they're stolen the world, they're all going to go
[34:43.440 --> 34:47.560]  to jail for the fiat currencies and garbage they've engaged in, they make Bernie Madoff
[34:47.560 --> 34:52.800]  look like a choir boy, and instead they got a plan to kill us, and they think we're so
[34:52.800 --> 35:00.240]  dumb we won't figure it out and stop them, and you know what, if we don't stop them
[35:00.240 --> 35:04.600]  we deserve it, and that's kind of the game they're playing.
[35:04.600 --> 35:08.520]  They're evil, what they're doing is wrong, I will not join with them, but it is very
[35:08.520 --> 35:14.240]  frustrating to be talking about something that is 100% on record that we are now leaving
[35:14.240 --> 35:18.480]  beta and entering operational.
[35:18.480 --> 35:22.680]  Most of you listening will be dead within eight years under their plan.
[35:22.680 --> 35:27.280]  Comprende, do you comprehend what I'm saying to you?
[35:27.280 --> 35:34.120]  This is not a damn game, and if you ask why they want me shut off more than anybody, it's
[35:34.120 --> 35:40.520]  because we are 100% over the target.
[35:40.520 --> 35:45.320]  I could play you just new clips I saw the last two days, I've got more than 15 clips
[35:45.320 --> 35:50.480]  of world leaders calling for depopulation and world dictatorship.
[35:50.480 --> 35:55.720]  Since I showed you five headlines last week, out of Financial Times, Bloomberg, New York
[35:55.720 --> 36:01.040]  Times, you name it, calling for dictatorship, there's more articles calling for dictatorship.
[36:01.040 --> 36:05.360]  The bad guys call for killing people, the bad guys call for cutting the resources off,
[36:05.360 --> 36:13.480]  the bad guys call for depopulation, the bad guys are in control.
[36:13.480 --> 36:17.160]  And it doesn't mean it's our whole government, they have hijacked our government.
[36:17.160 --> 36:21.520]  If a hijacker takes over a plane with a hand grenade and a gun, you don't start stabbing
[36:21.520 --> 36:26.320]  the windows out and attacking the control panel on the plane and trying to open the
[36:26.320 --> 36:29.400]  side hatch.
[36:29.400 --> 36:36.000]  You remove the hijacker, but they want to stab a civil war and destroy the airplane
[36:36.000 --> 36:37.400]  we're flying on here.
[36:37.400 --> 36:43.680]  That's really what America is, there's a floating continent on top of lava on a giant planetoid
[36:43.680 --> 36:46.360]  hurtling through space around its sun.
[36:46.360 --> 36:50.800]  But the point is, is that the analogy of running an airplane with a hijacker, and they're wearing
[36:50.800 --> 36:55.800]  the uniform of the captain, the captain's tied up behind him, and then after a while
[36:55.800 --> 37:00.280]  the hijacker starts bragging, yeah, not really the captain, yeah, I took over the thing, you're
[37:00.280 --> 37:01.280]  not going to do anything.
[37:01.280 --> 37:04.720]  He's sitting there picking his teeth with a toothpick all arrogantly, and he says to
[37:04.720 --> 37:07.080]  people on board the plane, who wants to join me?
[37:07.080 --> 37:11.600]  We're taking this plane to Cuba.
[37:11.600 --> 37:14.800]  And in modern America, a lot of women might start taking their clothes off and dancing
[37:14.800 --> 37:20.480]  saying, yeah, I got Stockholm syndrome, I really like you, I want to be with you.
[37:20.480 --> 37:22.800]  That's what people are like that are going along with this.
[37:22.800 --> 37:30.560]  It's ridiculous, it's stupid, and it's destructive, and it will bring us down.
[37:30.560 --> 37:38.280]  And speaking of that, I mean, the private run for profit federal reserve has been devaluing
[37:38.280 --> 37:45.200]  the dollar since they started the takeover over 100 years ago in 1913, 108, nine years
[37:45.200 --> 37:51.120]  ago, whatever it is now, 109 years ago.
[37:51.120 --> 37:59.240]  But more than half that devaluation happened between the 1970s and the end of the Trump
[37:59.240 --> 38:03.600]  administration, and Trump was part of this and one of the bad things he did.
[38:03.600 --> 38:07.840]  But at that point, inflation was here, and he was trying to get us out of a recession
[38:07.840 --> 38:11.520]  and try to bring the jobs back, but it still wasn't perfect.
[38:11.520 --> 38:16.240]  Under Biden, he puts all the regulations back on to shut down the jobs, to shut down the
[38:16.240 --> 38:20.600]  pipelines, to shut down the gas drilling, the oil drilling, everything you do to put a country
[38:20.600 --> 38:25.400]  into cardiac arrest, while opening the borders, while handing out more welfare, while doubling
[38:25.400 --> 38:32.680]  spending, and then start shipping trillions more in U.S. dollars around the world, and
[38:32.680 --> 38:39.320]  then they say we don't know why there's inflation.
[38:39.320 --> 38:42.840]  Now remember when I said when he first got in, I said his policies are going to accelerate
[38:42.840 --> 38:43.840]  it.
[38:43.840 --> 38:50.800]  There was more money issued and more currency put out in the first year of Biden, this was
[38:50.800 --> 38:57.800]  mainstream news, than there was in the whole history of the United States.
[38:57.800 --> 39:07.240]  Trump, Obama, Bush, Clinton, right back to George Washington.
[39:07.240 --> 39:12.880]  Now you think about that, and so remember a year ago they said there is no inflation.
[39:12.880 --> 39:16.520]  And then they said well a little inflation is good, then they said well it's only in
[39:16.520 --> 39:17.520]  certain areas.
[39:17.520 --> 39:25.520]  Well now Biden says he's taking inflation, that's the quote, very, very seriously, and
[39:25.520 --> 39:30.800]  then he goes on to blame the Republicans and he says they're not taking it seriously.
[39:30.800 --> 39:33.120]  Do you really want to hear him bubbling and babbling?
[39:33.120 --> 39:37.480]  There's the video on screen, Biden the number one threat is the strength and the strength
[39:37.480 --> 39:43.200]  that we are built on is inflation.
[39:43.200 --> 39:46.920]  Get that clip ready actually, that's another clip, I've got the clip right here where he
[39:46.920 --> 39:50.040]  says inflation is important and he blames the Republicans.
[39:50.040 --> 39:54.720]  I mean yeah, they're playing second fiddle, I guess they're to blame partly too, but you're
[39:54.720 --> 40:00.320]  like the one that put it into overdrive here with all your policies, and now I'd read that
[40:00.320 --> 40:03.640]  quote this morning, I didn't know it was an actual video of it, of him saying our strength
[40:03.640 --> 40:04.640]  is inflation.
[40:04.640 --> 40:08.760]  Yeah that's the global strength because they use the money first to buy up all the infrastructure
[40:08.760 --> 40:12.680]  and then hand us what, the debt and the devaluation.
[40:12.680 --> 40:18.320]  I mean folks, you always hear about places like Mexico and Venezuela or Zimbabwe or
[40:18.320 --> 40:22.320]  Weimar Germany that devalue their currencies and how horrible it was and how criminal their
[40:22.320 --> 40:29.760]  governments were, that's been done, it'd be like if I walked up and I had this dagger
[40:29.760 --> 40:37.680]  in my hand and I just stabbed you right in the heart, it'd take you a minute or two to
[40:37.680 --> 40:42.000]  probably die, maybe longer if you're tough, maybe that didn't really hit you in the right
[40:42.000 --> 40:47.440]  spot, so I go and stab you a couple more times, but we've been stabbed, okay, I mean we've
[40:47.440 --> 40:53.040]  been stabbed really bad, okay, and so everybody just needs to understand, again, there's no
[40:53.040 --> 40:57.920]  stopping it now, we really tried to stop the new world order getting this point, but they've
[40:57.920 --> 41:05.840]  now put the pig in the oven, they now let the cows out of the barn, they pulled the trigger
[41:05.840 --> 41:14.560]  baby, they opened Pandora's box, we let them do it and we are in deep trouble.
[41:14.560 --> 41:19.360]  And I say that because again, what is Biden's controllers having him do?
[41:19.360 --> 41:24.760]  If they can blame the populist and the republicans and people that were against this for what
[41:24.760 --> 41:30.400]  they've done, they win, if the globalist can blame Biden for all the horrible things that
[41:30.400 --> 41:34.320]  are happening and just blame Biden, they'll love that too, that's why he's seen all the
[41:34.320 --> 41:40.760]  new he is, so he'll take the blame, but if we blame the permanent deep state, if we blame
[41:40.760 --> 41:44.880]  the globalist, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Debo's
[41:44.880 --> 41:49.880]  Group, the Black Rock and all the people that sit there and abuse us that own these puppets,
[41:49.880 --> 41:54.080]  that run these attacks against us, that set the global lockdown policy, that are pushing
[41:54.080 --> 41:58.920]  the world ID and the forced injections, if we start addressing them instead of their
[41:58.920 --> 42:02.680]  puppets, it's game over.
[42:02.680 --> 42:12.400]  Their whole system rests on Rand Paul attacking Biden and Josh Hawley attacking Biden and
[42:12.400 --> 42:18.720]  you earn points and he's an idiot and all the republicans are gonna win this big sweep,
[42:18.720 --> 42:24.760]  and if you don't address the root of it and just heads of the Hydra, you can cut those
[42:24.760 --> 42:30.640]  heads off all day long and the Hydra just gets stronger, because while you're busy cutting
[42:30.640 --> 42:37.000]  one head off, it's eating your lunch and stomping you to death.
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.640]  So I just keep harping and harping and harping, why do they hate me number one?
[42:41.640 --> 42:48.800]  Because I identify them and once the globalists are identified in their criminal system, they
[42:48.800 --> 42:52.720]  all go to prison and this stuff stops and humanity's got a new lease on life.
[42:52.720 --> 42:56.640]  We'll be right back with these clips on Saki saying, well wait till you see what she had
[42:56.640 --> 42:59.880]  to say about inflation.

[44:51.420 --> 44:51.920]  Outline
[44:51.920 --> 44:56.920]  3139 is the InfoWars store
[44:56.920 --> 44:58.240]  That's InfoWars
[44:58.240 --> 45:00.240]  3139 is the InfoWars store.com
[45:00.240 --> 45:01.240]  Let's go ahead and take another call
[45:01.240 --> 45:03.240]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee
[45:03.240 --> 45:03.740]  Welcome!
[45:03.740 --> 45:04.240]  Hello Alex!
[45:04.240 --> 45:05.240]  Yes, Malcolm!
[45:05.240 --> 45:07.240]  Alright, I will make this quick and real short
[45:07.240 --> 45:09.240]  Where the other patrons can get on the line
[45:09.240 --> 45:11.240]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing
[45:11.240 --> 45:13.240]  From one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer
[45:13.240 --> 45:16.240]  Supermail Vitality and Brainforce Plus
[45:16.240 --> 45:19.240]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank
[45:19.240 --> 45:21.240]  Supermail Vitality really, really works
[45:21.240 --> 45:24.240]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[45:24.240 --> 45:26.240]  That have never been heated up
[45:26.240 --> 45:29.240]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to
[45:29.240 --> 45:31.240]  Powdered versions that also work quite well
[45:31.240 --> 45:33.240]  But just aren't as strong
[45:33.240 --> 45:35.240]  This is like a very fine wine
[45:35.240 --> 45:37.240]  In fact, each batch is different
[45:37.240 --> 45:39.240]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay
[45:39.240 --> 45:41.240]  People are like, why are you selling something
[45:41.240 --> 45:43.240]  And admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong
[45:43.240 --> 45:45.240]  That's just how it is, it's how it works
[45:45.240 --> 45:47.240]  So it's always good
[45:47.240 --> 45:49.240]  Sometimes it's like super strong
[45:49.240 --> 45:52.240]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price
[45:52.240 --> 45:57.240]  This is it
[46:22.240 --> 46:24.240]  Except for this fundraiser shirt
[46:24.240 --> 46:26.240]  That is a real hit and people love it
[46:26.240 --> 46:28.240]  It's $24.95, Alex Jones is right on the front
[46:28.240 --> 46:31.240]  The Red Thunderbolt, and then again on the back
[46:31.240 --> 46:33.240]  A big bold info wars dot com
[46:33.240 --> 46:35.240]  Exercise your first amendment, don't let the leftist
[46:35.240 --> 46:38.240]  And the globalists bully, silence you
[46:38.240 --> 46:40.240]  And fund the info war at the same time
[46:40.240 --> 46:43.240]  There is not a more politically incorrect shirt
[46:43.240 --> 46:45.240]  That sends a stronger message of freedom
[46:45.240 --> 46:46.240]  Resistance to the new world order
[46:46.240 --> 46:48.240]  Than the Alex Jones was right shirt
[46:48.240 --> 46:51.240]  Exclusively available at infowarstore.com
[46:51.240 --> 46:53.240]  This shirt is limited edition as well
[46:53.240 --> 46:55.240]  We're doing one more run and then no more
[46:55.240 --> 46:57.240]  infowarstore.com
[46:57.240 --> 47:26.240]  Get yours today
[47:27.240 --> 47:29.240]  I'm going to say it again
[47:29.240 --> 47:37.240]  Then I'm going to cover the news and what they're doing to us
[47:37.240 --> 47:40.240]  I have needed my adult life to expose
[47:40.240 --> 47:42.240]  The globalist shadow government
[47:42.240 --> 47:45.240]  While it was building its operation in quasi-secrecy
[47:45.240 --> 47:48.240]  I have traveled the world to expose their secret meetings
[47:48.240 --> 47:50.240]  I have been arrested, I have been sued
[47:50.240 --> 47:51.240]  I have been persecuted
[47:51.240 --> 47:54.240]  Because I knew that we had to stop them
[47:54.240 --> 47:55.240]  And I believed in you
[47:55.240 --> 47:57.240]  That once they went operational
[47:57.240 --> 47:58.240]  And we failed to stop them
[47:58.240 --> 48:00.240]  You would then beat them
[48:00.240 --> 48:04.240]  Because you would understand their plan
[48:04.240 --> 48:06.240]  I knew our credibility would explode
[48:06.240 --> 48:10.240]  And erupt like a volcano
[48:10.240 --> 48:14.240]  Once we exposed the new world order
[48:14.240 --> 48:19.240]  And once they launched their operation
[48:19.240 --> 48:24.240]  And we are now inside that new world order
[48:24.240 --> 48:26.240]  That new world order
[48:26.240 --> 48:29.240]  We are now fighting for our lives
[48:29.240 --> 48:32.240]  We know they are evil
[48:32.240 --> 48:36.240]  We know their plans for us are evil
[48:36.240 --> 48:39.240]  And now we have to make the choice
[48:39.240 --> 48:43.240]  Whether we want to be slaves
[48:43.240 --> 48:46.240]  And turn our children over to a fate worse than death
[48:46.240 --> 48:48.240]  Or we want to stand up together
[48:48.240 --> 48:51.240]  Of a race, color, and creed with dignity and honor
[48:51.240 --> 48:58.240]  And not comply with the globalists in any way
[48:58.240 --> 49:02.240]  They are using the most classic form of economic warfare
[49:02.240 --> 49:06.240]  To bring us under their control
[49:06.240 --> 49:15.240]  Here is Biden saying that inflation is our strength
[49:15.240 --> 49:19.240]  I've built a strong economy with a strong job market
[49:19.240 --> 49:23.240]  And I agree with what Chairman Powell said last week
[49:23.240 --> 49:26.240]  That the number one threat is the strength
[49:26.240 --> 49:30.240]  And that strength that we built is inflation
[49:30.240 --> 49:32.240]  So the Fed should do its job
[49:32.240 --> 49:36.240]  And it will do its job, I'm convinced, with that in mind
[49:36.240 --> 49:38.240]  All right
[49:38.240 --> 49:40.240]  Biden administration escalates war with Russia
[49:40.240 --> 49:43.240]  As Democrat abortion campaign heats up
[49:43.240 --> 49:46.240]  And as they devalue our dollar on our path
[49:46.240 --> 49:49.240]  To total and complete slavery
[49:49.240 --> 49:52.240]  Here's Jen Psaki, let's just play it back to back
[49:52.240 --> 49:55.240]  She doesn't think anyone could have predicted a year ago
[49:55.240 --> 49:58.240]  That inflation would soar to record highs
[49:58.240 --> 50:04.240]  And then she says that government policies
[50:04.240 --> 50:06.240]  Have not led to inflation
[50:06.240 --> 50:08.240]  Well, it's kind of true
[50:08.240 --> 50:10.240]  The Federal Reserve's private run for profit
[50:10.240 --> 50:12.240]  But sets policy with the government
[50:12.240 --> 50:15.240]  So here she is gaslighting the public
[50:15.240 --> 50:18.240]  So if we look at the recent inflation data
[50:18.240 --> 50:21.240]  Depending on which data you look at
[50:21.240 --> 50:24.240]  Two-thirds to even 70% of inflation data
[50:24.240 --> 50:26.240]  Is a result of energy prices
[50:26.240 --> 50:29.240]  A large part of that is the result
[50:29.240 --> 50:31.240]  And Chairman Powell has spoken to this
[50:31.240 --> 50:34.240]  And Secretary Yellen has also spoken to this
[50:34.240 --> 50:37.240]  As a result of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine
[50:37.240 --> 50:40.240]  And the impact on the global energy markets
[50:40.240 --> 50:42.240]  Those are all steps and impacts
[50:42.240 --> 50:45.240]  That I don't think anyone could have predicted a year ago
[50:45.240 --> 50:46.240]  Go ahead
[50:46.240 --> 50:49.240]  Yeah, as we look ahead to tomorrow's inflation speed
[50:49.240 --> 50:51.240]  Let me ask you to look back
[50:51.240 --> 50:54.240]  At some of the warnings that were issued
[50:54.240 --> 50:58.240]  Last year by Summers and Ratner and so on
[50:58.240 --> 51:00.240]  In retrospect, were they right
[51:00.240 --> 51:02.240]  That some of the government policies
[51:02.240 --> 51:05.240]  Were going to lead to inflation?
[51:05.240 --> 51:07.240]  I wouldn't say we agreed with them then
[51:07.240 --> 51:09.240]  And we don't agree with them now
[51:09.240 --> 51:12.240]  We note that as it relates to actions
[51:12.240 --> 51:14.240]  Like the American Rescue Plan
[51:14.240 --> 51:16.240]  The alternative to not putting in place
[51:16.240 --> 51:19.240]  And advocating for the American Rescue Plan
[51:19.240 --> 51:22.240]  Would have been the economy continuing to spiral
[51:22.240 --> 51:23.240]  Right?
[51:23.240 --> 51:25.240]  We were providing assistance and relief
[51:25.240 --> 51:27.240]  In the form of checks to people
[51:27.240 --> 51:29.240]  Who needed that assistance at the time
[51:29.240 --> 51:31.240]  They launched the viral attack
[51:31.240 --> 51:34.240]  They launched the lockdown that causes the collapse of the economy
[51:34.240 --> 51:36.240]  They devalue the currency and they tell you
[51:36.240 --> 51:39.240]  Whatever thing they want to do on record is
[51:39.240 --> 51:42.240]  Enslave you by making you completely poor
[51:42.240 --> 51:44.240]  The easiest way to control people
[51:44.240 --> 51:47.240]  And yes, the war in Ukraine
[51:47.240 --> 51:50.240]  Is the icing on the cake in prices increasing
[51:50.240 --> 51:52.240]  But it's just that
[51:52.240 --> 51:57.240]  It's the icing on the cake
[51:57.240 --> 51:59.240]  And the West started that war
[51:59.240 --> 52:02.240]  Even the Pope now admits that
[52:02.240 --> 52:06.240]  Unbelievable
[52:06.240 --> 52:09.240]  Absolutely unbelievable
[52:09.240 --> 52:11.240]  Let's look at some of these headlines
[52:11.240 --> 52:14.240]  Fact check, did nobody predict inflation
[52:14.240 --> 52:16.240]  As Saki claims?
[52:16.240 --> 52:18.240]  A Good Town Hall article showing a whole bunch of people
[52:18.240 --> 52:19.240]  Predicting it
[52:19.240 --> 52:21.240]  Hell, it was already bad inflation
[52:21.240 --> 52:23.240]  When he got in and now it just exploded
[52:23.240 --> 52:25.240]  Biden's economy markets fall more
[52:25.240 --> 52:28.240]  As S&P reaches 52-week low
[52:28.240 --> 52:31.240]  Gas prices jump to fresh record high
[52:31.240 --> 52:33.240]  And remember, the key
[52:33.240 --> 52:35.240]  She says it's Putin
[52:35.240 --> 52:38.240]  When he's shut down over 2,000 major pipelines
[52:38.240 --> 52:39.240]  And sub-pipelines
[52:39.240 --> 52:41.240]  Won't give out permits to fix pipelines
[52:41.240 --> 52:43.240]  Shut down the Keystone pipeline
[52:43.240 --> 52:46.240]  And it's now trying to shut down the main Canadian pipeline
[52:46.240 --> 52:49.240]  That supplies most of the damn Midwest
[52:52.240 --> 52:53.240]  And then
[52:53.240 --> 52:55.240]  Governor Whitmer couldn't shut it down
[52:55.240 --> 52:56.240]  And so Biden said
[52:56.240 --> 52:59.240]  Well, I'll just override our treaty with Canada
[52:59.240 --> 53:02.240]  Why the hell would you shut our pipelines off?
[53:02.240 --> 53:04.240]  I mean, this is
[53:04.240 --> 53:06.240]  Like you walk up to your neighbor sitting there
[53:06.240 --> 53:08.240]  Shooting holes in your car's engine
[53:08.240 --> 53:10.240]  And you go, why are you hurting my car?
[53:10.240 --> 53:12.240]  And they go, we're not hurting your car, we love you
[53:12.240 --> 53:15.240]  Why Putin shot holes in the engine of your car?
[53:19.240 --> 53:21.240]  Meanwhile, baby formula shortages affect
[53:21.240 --> 53:23.240]  New parents with increasing prices
[53:23.240 --> 53:25.240]  And lack of availability
[53:25.240 --> 53:30.240]  Waiting lists to buy it online, 2 months
[53:30.240 --> 53:33.240]  Tech giants lost more than 1 trillion in value
[53:33.240 --> 53:37.240]  In the last 3 trading days
[53:37.240 --> 53:39.240]  40% of Bitcoin investors are now under water
[53:39.240 --> 53:42.240]  New data shows
[53:42.240 --> 53:44.240]  Spectator says crypto's dead
[53:44.240 --> 53:45.240]  I don't agree with that
[53:45.240 --> 53:48.240]  But it's going to go down for a while
[53:48.240 --> 53:49.240]  But that's okay
[53:49.240 --> 53:52.240]  Because Joe Biden's got a next level brainwashing
[53:52.240 --> 53:53.240]  And inversion
[53:53.240 --> 53:56.240]  Reuters reports Biden to blast Republicans
[53:56.240 --> 54:00.240]  As having no plan on inflation
[54:00.240 --> 54:04.240]  His plan is more spending
[54:04.240 --> 54:09.240]  And of course, 40 billion dollars
[54:09.240 --> 54:10.240]  It was 38 billion a week ago
[54:10.240 --> 54:13.240]  To be sent to Ukraine of taxpayer money
[54:13.240 --> 54:15.240]  That's why you've got Club of Rome saying
[54:15.240 --> 54:19.240]  I hope we can depopulate in a civil way
[54:19.240 --> 54:21.240]  And that is what you're witnessing
[54:21.240 --> 54:24.240]  Right now is the beginning of the long slide
[54:24.240 --> 54:25.240]  Into oblivion
[54:25.240 --> 54:27.240]  And that is what we are fighting
[54:27.240 --> 54:32.240]  With every speck of energy we've got
[54:32.240 --> 54:34.240]  All major infrastructures
[54:34.240 --> 54:36.240]  But synthetic poison
[54:36.240 --> 54:37.240]  Whether it's crops
[54:37.240 --> 54:39.240]  Whether it's synthetic meat
[54:39.240 --> 54:40.240]  Whether it's synthetic milk
[54:40.240 --> 54:42.240]  They're taking even the regular formula away
[54:42.240 --> 54:44.240]  And they're going to make you eat bugs
[54:44.240 --> 54:45.240]  And make you drink sewage water
[54:45.240 --> 54:46.240]  And make you like it
[54:46.240 --> 54:47.240]  These are all quotes
[54:47.240 --> 54:49.240]  You think they'd put out Davos Group videos
[54:49.240 --> 54:51.240]  Highly produced
[54:51.240 --> 54:52.240]  Saying soon you'll have nothing
[54:52.240 --> 54:53.240]  Soon you'll eat bugs
[54:53.240 --> 54:55.240]  And you're like, oh, I'm not going to eat bugs
[54:55.240 --> 54:56.240]  Yeah, you are
[54:56.240 --> 54:58.240]  Because you're going to take it
[54:58.240 --> 55:00.240]  Because you like it
[55:00.240 --> 55:01.240]  I don't mean our general audience
[55:01.240 --> 55:03.240]  But the delusional leftist
[55:03.240 --> 55:04.240]  That's going along with this
[55:04.240 --> 55:06.240]  Bill Gates back company says
[55:06.240 --> 55:07.240]  Lab produced breast milk
[55:07.240 --> 55:12.240]  Is three to five years away
[55:12.240 --> 55:13.240]  Now, next hour
[55:13.240 --> 55:14.240]  I want to give the phone number out
[55:14.240 --> 55:15.240]  I want to take your calls
[55:15.240 --> 55:17.240]  But I've got a lot of other big abortion news
[55:17.240 --> 55:19.240]  Military news
[55:19.240 --> 55:20.240]  Putin clips to play
[55:20.240 --> 55:23.240]  So much it's important
[55:23.240 --> 55:25.240]  Coming up in this report
[55:25.240 --> 55:27.240]  First when we start next hour
[55:27.240 --> 55:29.240]  Blackstone, that's the top of the pyramid
[55:29.240 --> 55:31.240]  To acquire ancestry.com
[55:31.240 --> 55:33.240]  And the ownership of your DNA
[55:33.240 --> 55:35.240]  For 4.7 billion
[55:35.240 --> 55:37.240]  23andMe also says
[55:37.240 --> 55:39.240]  They're selling your DNA
[55:39.240 --> 55:44.240]  There you go, I warned you about it
[55:44.240 --> 55:46.240]  That was an evil conspiracy theorist
[55:46.240 --> 55:48.240]  But that happened years ago
[55:48.240 --> 55:50.240]  Now they're buying up more
[55:50.240 --> 55:53.240]  Of the companies
[55:53.240 --> 55:56.240]  Absolutely insane
[55:56.240 --> 55:58.240]  To have all this going on
[55:58.240 --> 56:03.240]  And all of this unfolding
[56:03.240 --> 56:04.240]  We're going to go to break
[56:04.240 --> 56:05.240]  I just want to thank all the leftists
[56:05.240 --> 56:07.240]  For your support
[56:07.240 --> 56:08.240]  We have been in the red
[56:08.240 --> 56:09.240]  The last few months
[56:09.240 --> 56:10.240]  With not even the money
[56:10.240 --> 56:11.240]  To be able to buy a future product
[56:11.240 --> 56:12.240]  To fund ourselves
[56:12.240 --> 56:14.240]  We got two million dollars
[56:14.240 --> 56:15.240]  Bitcoin donation
[56:15.240 --> 56:17.240]  I decided to put half of it into cash
[56:17.240 --> 56:18.240]  Into the operating fund
[56:18.240 --> 56:19.240]  And wait and see
[56:19.240 --> 56:20.240]  With the other million
[56:20.240 --> 56:21.240]  That other million is now
[56:21.240 --> 56:22.240]  Like $700,000
[56:22.240 --> 56:24.240]  I've decided to hold on to it
[56:24.240 --> 56:25.240]  And see what happens
[56:25.240 --> 56:27.240]  But see, that's not even a surety
[56:27.240 --> 56:28.240]  If that does a state of million
[56:28.240 --> 56:29.240]  We're back in the red
[56:29.240 --> 56:32.240]  An example of why we need your support

[56:39.240 --> 56:40.240]  Against the New World Order
[56:40.240 --> 56:41.240]  At this critical time
[56:41.240 --> 56:42.240]  Which is a must in my opinion
[56:42.240 --> 56:44.240]  But it's up to you
[56:44.240 --> 56:45.240]  I'm in your hands

[59:59.240 --> 1:00:02.240]  You've got to cut it

[1:00:04.240 --> 1:00:07.240]  You've got to cut it

[1:00:13.240 --> 1:00:14.240]  That's your boss
[1:00:14.240 --> 1:00:15.240]  You're out
[1:00:15.240 --> 1:00:24.320]  All right, Mike Hansen, my old good friend who was working with me 27, 28 years ago
[1:00:24.320 --> 1:00:29.680]  on Access TV, he's been going through and archiving all the old VHS tapes and dumping
[1:00:29.680 --> 1:00:34.400]  them to band.video on the Mike Hansen channel since his channel on YouTube got banned.
[1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:39.680]  Even Alex Jones from 25 years ago is verboten.
[1:00:39.680 --> 1:00:44.160]  But one of the things I did, this is going to be like in 96, 97, was a character I did
[1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:45.160]  probably 10 times.
[1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:46.860]  We've only found one tape of it.
[1:00:46.860 --> 1:00:50.560]  It's Global Love Cop, a global UN cop.
[1:00:50.560 --> 1:00:51.560]  And here's a few minutes of it.
[1:00:51.560 --> 1:00:55.640]  The full thing is on the Mike Hansen archives at Band.video.
[1:00:55.640 --> 1:00:56.640]  Here it is.
[1:00:56.640 --> 1:00:57.640]  We'll come back and cover a ton of news.
[1:00:57.640 --> 1:00:58.640]  We're going to rebuke them.
[1:00:58.640 --> 1:00:59.640]  Alex Jones.
[1:00:59.640 --> 1:01:02.640]  We'll send them air time so we can tell them what we're doing.
[1:01:02.640 --> 1:01:03.640]  That's right.
[1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:04.640]  All right.
[1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:05.640]  We're glad to be here.
[1:01:05.640 --> 1:01:08.640]  We don't agree with Alex Jones as famous and bold.
[1:01:08.640 --> 1:01:09.640]  Yes.
[1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:11.640]  We like big government.
[1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:14.800]  We like multi-jurisdictional task forces.
[1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:16.520]  We like it.
[1:01:16.520 --> 1:01:18.920]  We're loving global love cops.
[1:01:18.920 --> 1:01:19.920]  That's right.
[1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:20.920]  We don't want people to disagree.
[1:01:20.920 --> 1:01:21.920]  That's good.
[1:01:21.920 --> 1:01:22.920]  That's good.
[1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:25.720]  So, what are your names, your special agent?
[1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:28.840]  I am a multi-jurisdictional task force.
[1:01:28.840 --> 1:01:30.280]  Don't mind the ski mask.
[1:01:30.280 --> 1:01:32.280]  I'm here to protect you and your property.
[1:01:32.280 --> 1:01:33.280]  Yes.
[1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:35.800]  Just put on your side to seize it without due process.
[1:01:35.800 --> 1:01:36.800]  Yes.
[1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:38.720]  That's it for but your seizure.
[1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:39.840]  We're so loving.
[1:01:39.840 --> 1:01:41.840]  My name is Harold.
[1:01:41.840 --> 1:01:44.840]  My name is William.
[1:01:44.840 --> 1:01:46.840]  My name is Harold.
[1:01:46.840 --> 1:01:47.840]  Harold and William.
[1:01:47.840 --> 1:01:48.840]  Yes.
[1:01:48.840 --> 1:01:52.840]  And we're the world global love cops.
[1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:55.840]  We love the media.
[1:01:55.840 --> 1:01:57.840]  It says we're good.
[1:01:57.840 --> 1:01:58.840]  We are.
[1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:00.840]  The media likes us, too.
[1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:03.840]  The media loves us.
[1:02:03.840 --> 1:02:05.840]  The media, the loving media.
[1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:08.840]  They're our friends, you know.
[1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:10.840]  And don't listen to Bo.
[1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:15.840]  I agree with those callers earlier that have no thoughts to think that the government training
[1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:16.840]  centers have indoctrinated.
[1:02:16.840 --> 1:02:18.840]  Oh, understanding young youth.
[1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:19.840]  Yes.
[1:02:19.840 --> 1:02:22.840]  They're like, what did Mr. Rockefeller, our boss, say?
[1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:30.840]  Yes, our boss once said that government training centers were helpless people yielding themselves
[1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:32.840]  to our molding hands.
[1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:34.840]  And we are the molding hands.
[1:02:34.840 --> 1:02:37.840]  Sometimes we got to use force but it's for their best interest.
[1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:45.840]  And that's why we support bills like HR 1956 that allow further asset forfeiture laws.
[1:02:45.840 --> 1:02:47.840]  We like the seed property.
[1:02:47.840 --> 1:02:53.840]  If a neighbor doesn't give you up, we get to get their property, too.
[1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:54.840]  Yes.
[1:02:54.840 --> 1:02:56.840]  Oh, everyone's hotling on each other.
[1:02:56.840 --> 1:02:58.840]  We're global love cops.
[1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:01.840]  I think we've got some footage of your friends at work.
[1:03:01.840 --> 1:03:02.840]  Oh, yes.
[1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:04.840]  This is Bill and Sam.
[1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:05.840]  We can bring that up.
[1:03:05.840 --> 1:03:08.840]  Yes, let's show what our friends are doing.
[1:03:08.840 --> 1:03:09.840]  Let's show them.
[1:03:09.840 --> 1:03:10.840]  Let's show them.
[1:03:10.840 --> 1:03:11.840]  Let's show them love.
[1:03:11.840 --> 1:03:14.840]  Do you want to hear from, do you want to see, take some calls?
[1:03:14.840 --> 1:03:15.840]  Oh, yes.
[1:03:15.840 --> 1:03:16.840]  Oh.
[1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:20.840]  Yeah, we can take calls but we can also see the footage of our friends.
[1:03:20.840 --> 1:03:21.840]  They're in there.
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:23.840]  Yeah, that's on blue.
[1:03:23.840 --> 1:03:25.840]  And they're love actions.
[1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:26.840]  All right.
[1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:27.840]  I like it.
[1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:28.840]  Well, why do they bring that up?
[1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:30.840]  In fact, I love it.
[1:03:30.840 --> 1:03:35.840]  Oh, yes.
[1:03:35.840 --> 1:03:37.840]  We like what they say.
[1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:39.840]  Oh, we love them.
[1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:41.840]  Oh, we love them.
[1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:43.840]  Oh, we love them.
[1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:45.840]  Oh, we love what the government's done to you.
[1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:46.840]  Oh.
[1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:48.840]  They love them.
[1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:51.840]  They love them.
[1:03:51.840 --> 1:04:02.840]  They'll never stand up for private property.
[1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:07.840]  They're too busy.
[1:04:07.840 --> 1:04:09.840]  We love you.
[1:04:09.840 --> 1:04:12.840]  We love you.
[1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:13.840]  Oh.
[1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:15.840]  Well, let's take another call.
[1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:19.840]  Let's try to find someone serious to seriously come up with us.
[1:04:19.840 --> 1:04:21.840]  The logical arguments against this kind of behavior.
[1:04:21.840 --> 1:04:23.840]  We love police states.
[1:04:23.840 --> 1:04:27.840]  We love them innocent until proven guilty.
[1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:29.840]  No innocent until proven guilty.
[1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:31.840]  We love smashing through doors.
[1:04:31.840 --> 1:04:32.840]  Yes, Colin.
[1:04:32.840 --> 1:04:33.840]  I just want to know one thing.
[1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:36.840]  What the hell kind of jury you guys are on, you stupid asses?
[1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:38.840]  Oh, here's another one.
[1:04:38.840 --> 1:04:39.840]  We love you.
[1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:40.840]  I like you.
[1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:41.840]  Here's another one.
[1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:42.840]  I love you.
[1:04:42.840 --> 1:04:45.840]  Here's another one that we love.
[1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:48.840]  He loves us too.
[1:04:48.840 --> 1:04:49.840]  Oh, we do.
[1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:50.840]  Oh.
[1:04:50.840 --> 1:04:52.840]  We love you too.
[1:04:52.840 --> 1:04:54.840]  Oh, we love that attitude.
[1:04:54.840 --> 1:04:56.840]  You did nothing done that way.
[1:04:56.840 --> 1:05:19.840]  We love you.
[1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:55.840]  We love you.
[1:05:55.840 --> 1:06:02.840]  America and keeping us on the year.
[1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:50.840]  Well, you found it, the show they want off the air more than any other broadcast.
[1:06:50.840 --> 1:06:51.840]  The Alec Jones Show.
[1:06:51.840 --> 1:06:53.840]  I'm your host, very honored to be here.
[1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:58.840]  All right, for the next two hours, we're going to be taking your phone calls, first-time callers,
[1:06:58.840 --> 1:07:03.840]  people who've never called before, first-time callers, people that are long-time callers,
[1:07:03.840 --> 1:07:08.840]  people that disagree, agree, all I ask is you have a clean telephone and we get to your points,
[1:07:08.840 --> 1:07:09.840]  we get to the next person.
[1:07:09.840 --> 1:07:12.840]  I'm going to move quickly through calls today.
[1:07:12.840 --> 1:07:22.840]  877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[1:07:22.840 --> 1:07:27.840]  Tell us if you're a first-time caller and I will try to get you to the front of the line
[1:07:27.840 --> 1:07:29.840]  and in the order they receive.
[1:07:29.840 --> 1:07:34.840]  We'll put those two pieces of calculus together and come up with the answer.
[1:07:34.840 --> 1:07:38.840]  877-789-2539.
[1:07:38.840 --> 1:07:42.840]  Okay, let's hit this stack of news.
[1:07:42.840 --> 1:07:44.840]  The coberturity.
[1:07:44.840 --> 1:07:49.840]  Now, first off, we've known they're going to bring in new lockdowns and new variants of the virus
[1:07:49.840 --> 1:07:54.840]  and new control systems because in all their drills and preparations by the Carnegie,
[1:07:54.840 --> 1:07:58.840]  Rockefeller, and other endowments that run all this, they've been saying that's the plans.
[1:07:58.840 --> 1:08:00.840]  People keep asking, well, how did you know this was going to happen?
[1:08:00.840 --> 1:08:04.840]  Now they're saying, oh, new variants, new lockdowns are needed, mask again,
[1:08:04.840 --> 1:08:08.840]  because they want to cycle the tyranny on and off so that any time opposition builds,
[1:08:08.840 --> 1:08:12.840]  they'll back off, but then they'll bring it back again because statistically,
[1:08:12.840 --> 1:08:17.840]  people will resist less during each cycle.
[1:08:17.840 --> 1:08:22.840]  Basic psychology, the voice of doom, Dr. Fauci warns US could face more COVID lockdowns
[1:08:22.840 --> 1:08:26.840]  as he admits latest variants that hit US is less serious, Don McCromb,
[1:08:26.840 --> 1:08:28.840]  but we just can't say we're done.
[1:08:28.840 --> 1:08:35.840]  Yes, we're never done with your power grab and the trillions and trillions of dollars
[1:08:35.840 --> 1:08:40.840]  that special interests were given, not just here but in other countries,
[1:08:40.840 --> 1:08:43.840]  out of the taxpayer coffers in COVID relief,
[1:08:43.840 --> 1:08:48.840]  but there's one place they can steal the money even better where there's no checks and balances
[1:08:48.840 --> 1:08:53.840]  on where it goes, and that is Ukraine, the little proxy war,
[1:08:53.840 --> 1:08:57.840]  which the Democrats now admit is an official proxy war with Russia,
[1:08:57.840 --> 1:09:05.840]  dims ditch COVID funds to rush 40 billion to Ukraine.
[1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:08.840]  And let's look at what's happening with COVID,
[1:09:08.840 --> 1:09:11.840]  whether you're in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand,
[1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:16.840]  they're all reporting bizarre liver infections of a virus,
[1:09:16.840 --> 1:09:21.840]  but the children aren't testing positive for hepatitis A, B or C.
[1:09:21.840 --> 1:09:27.840]  They're calling it hepatitis like after they've been injected
[1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:30.840]  and what was in the previous studies of mRNA vaccines
[1:09:30.840 --> 1:09:37.840]  that a small percentage of people but still substantive would get liver failure.
[1:09:37.840 --> 1:09:48.840]  And here it is, Japan reports more suspected cases of unexplained acute hepatitis in children.
[1:09:48.840 --> 1:09:54.840]  And major scientists and studies have come out proving it is the shots.
[1:09:54.840 --> 1:10:01.840]  Just a few weeks ago it was the first cases, now it's spreading all over in the injected children.
[1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:05.840]  Sweden suffered fewer deaths per capita than much of Europe,
[1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:08.840]  despite refusing to enforce strict lockdowns.
[1:10:08.840 --> 1:10:13.840]  They were the lowest death rate.
[1:10:13.840 --> 1:10:15.840]  Can't make this up.
[1:10:15.840 --> 1:10:21.840]  Biden FDA chief insist misinformation is impacting life expectancy in the US.
[1:10:21.840 --> 1:10:25.840]  Life expectancy dropped in 2021 above 2020.
[1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:28.840]  When we had the vaccine, isn't that interesting?
[1:10:28.840 --> 1:10:31.840]  And all the actuaries from insurance companies in the Western world,
[1:10:31.840 --> 1:10:35.840]  wherever people took the shots, remember they didn't take the mRNA in China or Russia
[1:10:35.840 --> 1:10:39.840]  or a bunch of other places like India refused it.
[1:10:39.840 --> 1:10:46.840]  They don't have the 40% increase in death between 18 and 63.
[1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:54.840]  But the head of the FDA says that you cannot have people questioning their narratives.
[1:10:54.840 --> 1:10:58.840]  That's why you're dying, not from the experimental injections.
[1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:05.840]  And oh, Stephen Colbert, late show halts production after Stephen Colbert shows COVID symptoms.
[1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:10.840]  He says he's had at least three of the shots and has been sick three times in the last year,
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:16.840]  twice in the last month with, wait for it, COVID.
[1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:20.840]  And what a statistic show, you're much more likely to get COVID if you've been injected.
[1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:22.840]  I want to play this breakdown.
[1:11:22.840 --> 1:11:29.840]  This is a powerful explanation of the real rationale for masking from Lori Garrett
[1:11:29.840 --> 1:11:38.840]  to the National Academy of Medicine in 2018 saying masks are about creating fear.
[1:11:38.840 --> 1:11:40.840]  Masks are about creating fear.
[1:11:40.840 --> 1:11:44.840]  Here's what she had to say a year and a half before COVID.
[1:11:44.840 --> 1:11:49.840]  There's only a couple of countries that have ever really done large scale studies
[1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:51.840]  to try and figure out what might work.
[1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:54.840]  Japan, it may not surprise you, is one of them.
[1:11:54.840 --> 1:12:00.840]  And they, in one of their large studies, they basically showed that the masks,
[1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:07.840]  it seemed like the major efficacy of a mask is that it causes alarm in the other person.
[1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:09.840]  And so you stay away from each other.
[1:12:09.840 --> 1:12:11.840]  And that's what I think happened with SARS.
[1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:15.840]  When I was in the SARS epidemic, I saw everywhere all over Asia,
[1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:19.840]  people started wearing these masks, and it is alarming when you walk down the street
[1:12:19.840 --> 1:12:22.840]  and everybody coming towards you has a mask on.
[1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:24.840]  You definitely do social distancing.
[1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:27.840]  You definitely, it's just a gut thing.
[1:12:27.840 --> 1:12:29.840]  But did the mask really help them?
[1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:31.840]  Did the mask keep the virus out?
[1:12:31.840 --> 1:12:33.840]  Almost certainly not.
[1:12:33.840 --> 1:12:41.840]  If the virus was around their face, the mask would not have made the difference.
[1:12:41.840 --> 1:12:46.840]  But have you questioned that in the last two years on any big tech platform,
[1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:49.840]  no matter how much money you'd use to advertise it for your business,
[1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:52.840]  no matter how many people you promoted to, no matter if you had a thousand followers
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:55.840]  or a million, they would delete you.
[1:12:55.840 --> 1:12:57.840]  And now Bill Gates came out.
[1:12:57.840 --> 1:12:59.840]  Last week, we played the clip.
[1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:05.840]  He said, oh, it turns out, Covid's like the flu, but we didn't know that.
[1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:11.840]  When his modeling companies lied and said, five million dead here,
[1:13:11.840 --> 1:13:15.840]  a million dead in the UK, and none of it was true,
[1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:16.840]  they lied on purpose.
[1:13:16.840 --> 1:13:21.840]  But now he's going to help run the government truth ministry,
[1:13:21.840 --> 1:13:25.840]  Ministry of Truth, and the very people that lied to us about everything
[1:13:25.840 --> 1:13:31.840]  and censored us, if we expose the hysteria and these rituals of idiocy
[1:13:31.840 --> 1:13:34.840]  to see what we would put up with, they would then ban you.
[1:13:34.840 --> 1:13:39.840]  Or the skateboard park in Los Angeles,
[1:13:39.840 --> 1:13:48.840]  and they'd cover it with millions of dollars of sand,
[1:13:48.840 --> 1:13:52.840]  filling it up so that no one could go there,
[1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:56.840]  so that no one would be able to enjoy themselves outdoors
[1:13:56.840 --> 1:13:59.840]  and get vitamin D, so they'd sit inside and not get medical treatment
[1:13:59.840 --> 1:14:02.840]  for the flu and other diseases, other viruses and die,
[1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:05.840]  while they kept people out of the nursing homes to see their families
[1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:09.840]  so they could quietly kill them and get $53,000 for every bounty
[1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:11.840]  and every person they murdered.
[1:14:11.840 --> 1:14:13.840]  And look at this photo for TV viewers.
[1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:18.840]  Trudeau wears a mask in Canada with a 90% vax rate for show,
[1:14:18.840 --> 1:14:21.840]  but not in Ukraine with a 35% vax rate.
[1:14:21.840 --> 1:14:23.840]  Vax their fraudulent science, you're not supposed to question.
[1:14:23.840 --> 1:14:25.840]  And why can't you question that science?
[1:14:25.840 --> 1:14:29.840]  Because it's not science, it's fraud, and the essence of science is questioning.
[1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:36.840]  On its face, this is all a giant fraud, all a huge lie.
[1:14:36.840 --> 1:14:38.840]  And I love this meme going around.
[1:14:38.840 --> 1:14:42.840]  It's got an image of Pfizer with a trendy 1970s businessman
[1:14:42.840 --> 1:14:46.840]  with an injector, Abaddon McNeil in his hand,
[1:14:46.840 --> 1:14:50.840]  and it shows 12% of the time it works for a short time.
[1:14:50.840 --> 1:14:55.840]  Pfizer, what a great product to force people to make.
[1:14:55.840 --> 1:15:00.840]  And let's not forget what all these people did to us,
[1:15:00.840 --> 1:15:01.840]  like Piers Morgan saying,
[1:15:01.840 --> 1:15:04.840]  footballers who refuse to be jabs, who refuse treatment for injuries.
[1:15:04.840 --> 1:15:08.840]  After all, why should they trust doctors about treatment for broken legs
[1:15:08.840 --> 1:15:11.840]  and torn ligaments if they don't trust them about life-saving vaccine?
[1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:14.840]  Oh, that's not a vaccine, that's experimental, that was forced through,
[1:15:14.840 --> 1:15:18.840]  that they own British Ministry of Health said you shouldn't give to old people
[1:15:18.840 --> 1:15:23.840]  under 16 or folks with autoimmune problems.
[1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:27.840]  And then every hour I see articles of healthy athletes and students,
[1:15:27.840 --> 1:15:32.840]  high school, college, taking the shot and dying days later of heart attacks.
[1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:35.840]  There's the CBC reporting on that.
[1:15:35.840 --> 1:15:39.840]  University student, remembered as a fabulous force,
[1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:43.840]  died of swollen heart and heart attack.
[1:15:43.840 --> 1:15:46.840]  This is the mind control, this is the garbage.
[1:15:46.840 --> 1:15:50.840]  All right, we'll be right back on the other side with your phone calls.
[1:15:50.840 --> 1:15:55.840]  I've got more economic news and the big Russian developments and Putin clips coming up.

[1:19:17.840 --> 1:19:20.840]  That helped us finance hiring the first three members of my crew.
[1:19:20.840 --> 1:19:23.840]  That's our oldest design and we're still selling.
[1:19:23.840 --> 1:19:27.840]  We have that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions
[1:19:27.840 --> 1:19:29.840]  because whatever stock we've got in, that's it.

[1:19:34.840 --> 1:19:36.840]  We'll still have some teachers in the future.
[1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:38.840]  They'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:41.840]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[1:19:41.840 --> 1:19:43.840]  I almost forgot.
[1:19:43.840 --> 1:19:46.840]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[1:19:46.840 --> 1:19:51.840]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt,
[1:19:51.840 --> 1:20:17.840]  regular shirts, designer shirts, they're all selling at cost infowarstore.com.
[1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:30.840]  It's so easy to be with the sound.
[1:20:30.840 --> 1:20:34.840]  So if you remember two years ago, early into the global lockdown
[1:20:34.840 --> 1:20:39.840]  and the new biomedical tyranny, training wheels they had us on,
[1:20:39.840 --> 1:20:42.840]  I told you this is all just a test for future bigger lockdowns
[1:20:42.840 --> 1:20:46.840]  and that as civilization collapses and the third world collapses,
[1:20:46.840 --> 1:20:51.840]  Pentagon studies show within 10 days most people become homicidal maniacs of no electricity
[1:20:51.840 --> 1:20:52.840]  or food.
[1:20:52.840 --> 1:20:56.840]  Within 15, most people commit suicide or become cannibals.
[1:20:56.840 --> 1:21:00.840]  So then I said, it's like a modest proposal written by Jonathan Swift
[1:21:00.840 --> 1:21:03.840]  300 years ago about the Irish starving to death.
[1:21:03.840 --> 1:21:04.840]  Nobody wanted to help them.
[1:21:04.840 --> 1:21:08.840]  So he said, well, why don't the Irish sell their children to us to eat?
[1:21:08.840 --> 1:21:11.840]  And it was side-tired, but it woke people up.
[1:21:11.840 --> 1:21:14.840]  So I then said, well, I'll have to eat my neighbor then.
[1:21:14.840 --> 1:21:17.840]  Media edited out of context and went with that.
[1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:21.840]  But the point is, is that that's what's happening here.
[1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:24.840]  Well, actually intro the next segment with that.
[1:21:24.840 --> 1:21:28.840]  I told you two years ago, I said, when these lockdowns end, they're going to bring them back.
[1:21:28.840 --> 1:21:33.840]  But I said, they'll have climate lockdowns after that officially and unofficially
[1:21:33.840 --> 1:21:36.840]  because the prices will be so high you won't be able to travel.
[1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:38.840]  Well, now the headlines are a new lockdowns here.
[1:21:38.840 --> 1:21:39.840]  Inflation.
[1:21:39.840 --> 1:21:44.840]  Americans planning summer travel face a new hurdle, high inflation.
[1:21:44.840 --> 1:21:46.840]  It's a broken social contract.
[1:21:46.840 --> 1:21:48.840]  They don't want you to be mobile.
[1:21:48.840 --> 1:21:49.840]  They don't want you to be free.
[1:21:49.840 --> 1:21:55.840]  They don't want you to be what they call uppity.
[1:21:55.840 --> 1:21:58.840]  We better unify and fight this, folks.
[1:21:58.840 --> 1:22:01.840]  All right, let's go to David and then we'll go to Nicole.
[1:22:01.840 --> 1:22:03.840]  David in Texas, thanks for calling.
[1:22:03.840 --> 1:22:05.840]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:11.840]  I just wanted to get your thoughts on the upcoming famine crisis.
[1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:13.840]  Are you going off grid?
[1:22:13.840 --> 1:22:16.840]  What is your plan personally, if you don't mind me asking?
[1:22:16.840 --> 1:22:22.840]  Well, I mean, I spend 5% of my time in defense for myself and my family.
[1:22:22.840 --> 1:22:26.840]  And I spent 95% in offense trying to warn everybody and stop this.
[1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:34.840]  But we've got trailers in the countryside, water wells, backup power, fuel tanks,
[1:22:34.840 --> 1:22:38.840]  and gardens and friends and family to work with.
[1:22:38.840 --> 1:22:42.840]  Yeah, that's the most important thing.
[1:22:42.840 --> 1:22:45.840]  I mean, we don't have anything elaborate or fancy or anything,
[1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:52.840]  but believe me, going out to the country on family property that we've had for a long time
[1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:54.840]  and getting ready made me not want to leave.
[1:22:54.840 --> 1:22:58.840]  I had been out to my dad's ranch in like three, four years.
[1:22:58.840 --> 1:23:00.840]  I used to go out there every month.
[1:23:00.840 --> 1:23:03.840]  And going back out there made me want to stay out there.
[1:23:03.840 --> 1:23:07.840]  We have a lot of old ranch houses and things that are halfway falling down.
[1:23:07.840 --> 1:23:10.840]  We've had family there since the 1820s.
[1:23:10.840 --> 1:23:14.840]  Old homesteads are out there, but some of the ranch houses are 150 years old.
[1:23:14.840 --> 1:23:16.840]  And they're just kind of spooky and creaky and weird.
[1:23:16.840 --> 1:23:19.840]  We're trying to fix them up, but it almost costs more money to do that.
[1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:23.840]  So we just, my dad and mom put a double wide trailer out there.
[1:23:23.840 --> 1:23:25.840]  And that's where we intend to stay.
[1:23:25.840 --> 1:23:28.840]  Everything basically collapses and goes to zero.
[1:23:28.840 --> 1:23:32.840]  We got a forestry operation where we got cows.
[1:23:32.840 --> 1:23:35.840]  We already have a ranch. We already had a little vineyard out there.
[1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:41.840]  We already have a forestry operation with pine trees.
[1:23:41.840 --> 1:23:45.840]  So we already have a sustainable operation out there with friends and family.
[1:23:45.840 --> 1:23:47.840]  And most of our family are veterans.
[1:23:47.840 --> 1:23:49.840]  And so they're all within a half mile of each other.
[1:23:49.840 --> 1:23:54.840]  So it's not the perfect place to be, but it's a better know where.
[1:23:54.840 --> 1:23:55.840]  Right. I agree.
[1:23:55.840 --> 1:23:57.840]  So I have one more question for you real quick.
[1:23:57.840 --> 1:24:04.840]  What do you say to the people who would maybe try to call you out for saying that, oh, Alex Jones didn't predict anything.
[1:24:04.840 --> 1:24:11.840]  I mean, all this Huxley and Edward Bernays and, you know, all these other people like these, like, I wouldn't call them revolutionaries,
[1:24:11.840 --> 1:24:15.840]  but they were just like philosophical revolutionaries, I would say.
[1:24:15.840 --> 1:24:19.840]  But like, what do you say to the people who say, like, oh, you didn't predict anything.
[1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:21.840]  You didn't know any of this was coming. It was all of them.
[1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:23.840]  You know, it was all the people in the past, you know,
[1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:28.840]  I would say absolutely that's what I say all the time is this is not my opinion.
[1:24:28.840 --> 1:24:34.840]  This is on record with the bad guys and the good guys admitting this plan.
[1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:37.840]  And so I've been covering it for 28 years on air.
[1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:43.840]  And when we've gone in to read the Rockefeller documents and popularize their plan for lock downs and mask and all that.
[1:24:43.840 --> 1:24:45.840]  And, you know, we've broken a lot of stuff.
[1:24:45.840 --> 1:24:53.840]  But certainly I'm not trying to be the Grand Puba Oracle, the big kahuna that everybody comes to and only I know what's going on.
[1:24:53.840 --> 1:24:57.840]  I'm trying to decompartmentalize known information.
[1:24:57.840 --> 1:25:03.840]  So what I say to those people is, OK, yes, I didn't predict anything.
[1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:08.840]  I showed you a real criminal battle plan that was in beta hoping you would stand up and stop it.
[1:25:08.840 --> 1:25:13.840]  But of course the discussion, but of course the discussion goes back to, well, he's not right then.
[1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:14.840]  It just all came true.
[1:25:14.840 --> 1:25:16.840]  I don't even matter in this equation.
[1:25:16.840 --> 1:25:20.840]  I mean, we're putting in water wells and solar power, getting ready for total collapse here.
[1:25:20.840 --> 1:25:22.840]  And I just wish people wake up and stop it.
[1:25:22.840 --> 1:25:25.840]  I don't give a rat's ass who gets the fricking credit.
[1:25:25.840 --> 1:25:26.840]  Right, right.
[1:25:26.840 --> 1:25:27.840]  No, I totally agree.
[1:25:27.840 --> 1:25:34.840]  It shouldn't matter who like came up with the idea first because the idea come really came from the globalist.
[1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:41.840]  Like the seed of all of this, you know, like destruction and terror and all this stuff is comes from the globalist.
[1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:46.840]  It's just, you know, there were those people that were trying to call it out in the early stages before it got anywhere.
[1:25:46.840 --> 1:25:54.840]  But now, you know, you look around and man, everyone, they're just using NLP and like psycho, like psycho, you know,
[1:25:54.840 --> 1:26:03.840]  they're using gaslighting behavioral psychology tactics on everybody on triple quadruple mixed disinfo to create entire systems of fraud to totally confuse people.
[1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:07.840]  But it's having the biggest effect on them and only making them look like clowns.
[1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:11.840]  Instead of stopping lying, they up the line the next level and now they look like clowns.
[1:26:11.840 --> 1:26:14.840]  You see, they're drinking their own Kool-Aid.
[1:26:14.840 --> 1:26:17.840]  There's an old saying, you can't fool an honest man.
[1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:18.840]  Right.
[1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:19.840]  And it's the same thing.
[1:26:19.840 --> 1:26:22.840]  They fooled themselves and that's what's so dangerous.
[1:26:22.840 --> 1:26:24.840]  100%, Alex.
[1:26:24.840 --> 1:26:25.840]  100%.
[1:26:25.840 --> 1:26:27.840]  Well, I'm here with you and I'm praying for you.
[1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:28.840]  God bless you, brother.
[1:26:28.840 --> 1:26:29.840]  I appreciate you.
[1:26:29.840 --> 1:26:30.840]  Let's go to Nicole, Indiana.
[1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:33.840]  Let's talk about Venezuela and how bad things got coming to the USA.
[1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:34.840]  Hello, Nicole.
[1:26:34.840 --> 1:26:35.840]  Welcome.
[1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:36.840]  Hi, Alex.
[1:26:36.840 --> 1:26:37.840]  It's a pleasure to talk to you.
[1:26:37.840 --> 1:26:42.840]  I listened to you years ago and now I've been listening to you for the last two years.
[1:26:42.840 --> 1:26:45.840]  Also, I love the X3 survival shield.
[1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:46.840]  Thank you.
[1:26:46.840 --> 1:26:47.840]  It's great.
[1:26:47.840 --> 1:26:48.840]  Yes, Venezuela.
[1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:52.840]  Yeah, we went there in 2010.
[1:26:52.840 --> 1:27:04.840]  The last time we were there in 2015 and the amount of destruction that happened and those few short years was just heartbreaking.
[1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:09.840]  You know, you touched on the formula shortage here in the States.
[1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:22.840]  When we were there, I believe in 2014, you actually had to take your baby with a birth certificate on the chance that there might be formula in diapers.
[1:27:22.840 --> 1:27:26.840]  And Venezuela has more resources per square foot than any country in the world.
[1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:31.840]  They were the richest country in Latin America till Hugo Chavez took them over and now it is a wrecked hellhole.
[1:27:31.840 --> 1:27:37.840]  No dogs and cats on the streets, no birds on the streets, the people thousands die a week of starvation.
[1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:44.840]  And just year after year after year of it on purpose by design, the country made a deal with the IMF and World Bank.
[1:27:44.840 --> 1:27:45.840]  Yes.
[1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:55.840]  I mean, it was a joke, I believe, in 2014, how many inches of money that we would have to take just to go out to dinner.
[1:27:55.840 --> 1:27:58.840]  It's not funny now, but it's serious.
[1:27:58.840 --> 1:28:02.840]  So I just want to touch on that. I appreciate all you do.
[1:28:02.840 --> 1:28:05.840]  I appreciate you. What was getting you down to Venezuela?
[1:28:05.840 --> 1:28:10.840]  We just take vacations, you know, and we wanted to do something different.
[1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:14.840]  And actually we were in on Margarita Island.
[1:28:14.840 --> 1:28:18.840]  So it's actually off the coast of Venezuela.
[1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:21.840]  So yeah, we just kind of planned.
[1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:24.840]  I found it years ago and we thought, OK, we'll try it.
[1:28:24.840 --> 1:28:30.840]  We made a lot of friends and unfortunately a lot of those friends had to leave because it's so bad.
[1:28:30.840 --> 1:28:34.840]  Absolutely. And then when they come here, the Democrats brainwash them.
[1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:36.840]  The main communists do the same thing here.
[1:28:36.840 --> 1:28:42.840]  We had the media, we could actually bring on these people and then train them how America actually operates through free will.
[1:28:42.840 --> 1:28:48.840]  They'd be on board, but so many of them end up coming here to then do the same thing that destroyed their nation, destroyed our nation.
[1:28:48.840 --> 1:28:50.840]  Thank you so much to call Great Call.
[1:28:50.840 --> 1:28:54.840]  More powerful calls straight ahead and we'll come in with that little piece on.

[1:31:57.840 --> 1:32:03.840]  The first ten amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791.
[1:32:03.840 --> 1:32:08.840]  The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press.
[1:32:08.840 --> 1:32:13.840]  Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship,
[1:32:13.840 --> 1:32:16.840]  interference and restraint by the government.
[1:32:16.840 --> 1:32:23.840]  231 years later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious attack.
[1:32:23.840 --> 1:32:28.840]  GCN is under attack. Your freedom is currently under siege from those
[1:32:28.840 --> 1:32:33.840]  who do not want you to know the truth. I'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you
[1:32:33.840 --> 1:32:38.840]  to rise up and help us defend our right to continue telling you the truth.

[1:32:53.840 --> 1:33:19.840]  You may select all of those choices. I'm Vincent Finnelli.
[1:33:19.840 --> 1:33:23.840]  I will eat my neighbors. I'm not letting my kids die. I'm just going to be honest.
[1:33:23.840 --> 1:33:27.840]  My superpower is being honest. I've extrapolated this out and I won't have to
[1:33:27.840 --> 1:33:31.840]  for a few years since I got food and stuff, but I'm literally looking at my neighbors
[1:33:31.840 --> 1:33:35.840]  now and going, I'm ready to hang them up and gut them and skin them and chop them up.
[1:33:35.840 --> 1:33:37.840]  You know what? I'm ready. My daughters aren't starving to death.
[1:33:37.840 --> 1:33:43.840]  I'll eat my neighbors. See, my superpower is being honest. I'll eat your ass.
[1:33:43.840 --> 1:33:50.840]  I will. I'm combat model, optimal self-sufficiency, probably the leader.
[1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:54.840]  The point is, is if you thought about that yet, because I'm somebody that thought
[1:33:54.840 --> 1:33:59.840]  I could fix this and I'm starting to think about having to eat my neighbors.
[1:33:59.840 --> 1:34:04.840]  You think I like sizing up my neighbor? How I'm going to haul him up by chain
[1:34:04.840 --> 1:34:10.840]  and chop his ass up? I'll do it. My children aren't going hungry.
[1:34:10.840 --> 1:34:15.840]  I will eat your ass. That's why I want the globalists to know.
[1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:20.840]  I will eat your ass first.
[1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:26.840]  Shock poll reveals Americans are okay with Ukraine losing the war with
[1:34:26.840 --> 1:34:31.840]  Putin's Russia, London Express, the monthly Democrat Institute Express poll
[1:34:31.840 --> 1:34:37.840]  of 1,500 Americans who are likely voters has shown 43% are okay with Ukraine losing,
[1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:42.840]  prior to 41% not okay, while 60% have no opinion.
[1:34:42.840 --> 1:34:47.840]  And even the popes come out against the war saying the bad guys are the weapons manufacturers
[1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:53.840]  that started the war with Russia in the last eight years in George Soros.
[1:34:53.840 --> 1:34:57.840]  That's a big deal, because he's been locked up with these people and everything
[1:34:57.840 --> 1:35:02.840]  and now he broke with them on that. That shows that people understand this is deadly dangerous
[1:35:02.840 --> 1:35:07.840]  Russia is not going to back down and look, nothing against Zelensky that he's a gay porn star.
[1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:13.840]  Just the issue is he's fully compromised. I'm not judging him that he's a gay porn star.
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:17.840]  He's a handsome guy. The point is that that's what's going on.
[1:35:17.840 --> 1:35:21.840]  It's why they can blackmail him just like the other gay porn star, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[1:35:21.840 --> 1:35:28.840]  Okay, we're to begin here. I got some big January 6 news I want to hit.
[1:35:28.840 --> 1:35:32.840]  I got some big Russian is I'm going to hit that star the next hour.
[1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:35.840]  Let's go right back to your calls is jam this this hour full of calls here.
[1:35:35.840 --> 1:35:40.840]  Let's go ahead and go the order they received Carlos in Texas.
[1:35:40.840 --> 1:35:44.840]  You're on the air. Welcome. Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[1:35:44.840 --> 1:35:48.840]  I want to say I love the shirt. I just bought me a crap ton of shirts.
[1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:51.840]  I'm hoping to get more this week. I wear the crap out of them.
[1:35:51.840 --> 1:35:55.840]  My wife gets scared because she thinks we're going to get attacked but never been attacked.
[1:35:55.840 --> 1:36:00.840]  I don't think I ever will. There's a lot of people that support you Alex and hopefully they'll continue.
[1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:05.840]  Well, thank you. And again, I had designed hundreds of shirts myself.
[1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:08.840]  Didn't promote most of them. Some were big sellers, most weren't.
[1:36:08.840 --> 1:36:12.840]  We had a stockpile of them and so we had 63,000 shirts.
[1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:16.840]  We're selling them all out at cost. We're down to 15,000 of the original shirts.
[1:36:16.840 --> 1:36:21.840]  When those are gone, we'll never redesign or never, you know, re-release those.
[1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:26.840]  So folks want to go over what's left there. They're at infowarstore.com.
[1:36:26.840 --> 1:36:31.840]  We have one shirt that's being sold above cost and that's the Alex Jones's right shirt.
[1:36:31.840 --> 1:36:37.840]  It's been sold out, but it's been back ordered. Those are coming in early next week for everybody that wants to pre-order to make sure they get that.
[1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:41.840]  It's a limited edition. We're doing this run of them and no more.
[1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:47.840]  There's another designer version coming in and that'll be it for this design of the Alex Jones's right shirt at infowarstore.com.
[1:36:47.840 --> 1:36:51.840]  It helps keep us on air. So thank you, Carlos, for keeping us on air. Go ahead.
[1:36:51.840 --> 1:36:56.840]  Hey, Alex, I wanted to talk about last year, I called you last year.
[1:36:56.840 --> 1:37:06.840]  My mom came out from COVID, but I have two examples of being treated at the hospital and being treated by what Dr. Bartlett.
[1:37:06.840 --> 1:37:13.840]  By what I heard on your show with Dr. Bartlett, he's 100% well, just like your parents.
[1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:18.840]  Well, my mom got screwed up by the damn room death and if you're there, they really jacked her up.
[1:37:18.840 --> 1:37:23.840]  Yeah, it kills about 38% of people they give it to and doesn't even help you with COVID.
[1:37:23.840 --> 1:37:28.840]  It's a murder weapon. Put out a foul, so you just like you put out ACT to kill people that HIV.
[1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:33.840]  And what I'm doing with the two examples that I have is I tell people about it.
[1:37:33.840 --> 1:37:40.840]  They don't believe me, but I show them pictures of my mom pre-COVID and post-COVID and my dad pre-COVID and post-COVID.
[1:37:40.840 --> 1:37:46.840]  My dad's as strong as a damn off. There's nothing wrong with him, but he has to take care of my mom.
[1:37:46.840 --> 1:37:52.840]  He's the one that making sure she goes through doctor's visits, the medications that they're giving her,
[1:37:52.840 --> 1:37:56.840]  I don't know if they're helping her or if they're killing her. I don't know what the hell is going on,
[1:37:56.840 --> 1:38:01.840]  but I'm trying my best. I'm probably going to have to call Dr. Peter McCuller or something to help me out.
[1:38:01.840 --> 1:38:03.840]  You know what I'm saying?
[1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:10.840]  Well, there's no doubt that Rendezemir, they knew would cause kidney failure, renal failure, and they did it.
[1:38:10.840 --> 1:38:15.840]  These people are sick murderers, seeing what they can get away with.
[1:38:15.840 --> 1:38:23.840]  They are very evil adults, but you know what? I think in the end, giving these examples and us talking about it
[1:38:23.840 --> 1:38:28.840]  and me, I'm trying to put more traffic to the show every chance I get.
[1:38:28.840 --> 1:38:33.840]  People that didn't believe me two years ago or 10 years ago, they're calling me now,
[1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:37.840]  Carlos, what do we do? I'm like, well, I've been getting ready for about 12 years, buddy.
[1:38:37.840 --> 1:38:41.840]  You're about 10 years behind.
[1:38:41.840 --> 1:38:46.840]  Well, that's the good news. That's the silver lining here as the awakening is explosive.
[1:38:46.840 --> 1:38:53.840]  Thank you, Carlos, for the call. Let's go to Jack in Wisconsin, where the Democrats are firebombing pro-life facilities.
[1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:55.840]  Go ahead, Jack. Welcome.
[1:38:55.840 --> 1:39:02.840]  Hi, Mr. Jones. I want to be like a cool cat and kind of link some things together with yarn,
[1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:07.840]  specifically adrenochrome, abortion, Russia, corona, and coronavirus.
[1:39:07.840 --> 1:39:13.840]  First, I think you guys need to always take into consideration that we don't know the true abortion number,
[1:39:13.840 --> 1:39:18.840]  because they don't take into account or count the chemical abortions with the pill.
[1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:25.840]  The only numbers we get are the surgical abortions, and the estimates that have been done by the pro-life groups are, like,
[1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:29.840]  hundreds and hundreds of millions of chemical abortions.
[1:39:29.840 --> 1:39:34.840]  And I think it's linked up with the ambrosia blood harvesting adrenochrome,
[1:39:34.840 --> 1:39:42.840]  like in Escape from LA with Snake Plisken, where, like, there's old people who need to take anti-rejection drugs
[1:39:42.840 --> 1:39:48.840]  in order to prolong their life by taking the blood and organs and limbs from the youth,
[1:39:48.840 --> 1:39:56.840]  which is connected to Russia, because they have a voluntary stem cell and ambrosia donation program in their country,
[1:39:56.840 --> 1:40:04.840]  and also have one in 1,000 vaccine rates due to orthodoxy, very low vaccine rates,
[1:40:04.840 --> 1:40:09.840]  which is important to have a control group for coronavirus and the corresponding vaccine.
[1:40:09.840 --> 1:40:15.840]  That's right. That's why they want every country to take the shots so that they can cover up all the death numbers.
[1:40:15.840 --> 1:40:19.840]  But if you have countries that don't, and they're all healthy, like some of the African countries in Russia,
[1:40:19.840 --> 1:40:22.840]  well, then that shows it's the shot causing the problem.
[1:40:22.840 --> 1:40:30.840]  Yes, totally. And I think maybe NATO's trying to invade Russia to control that resource as well as the other resources.
[1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:34.840]  And yesterday, I was so glad you brought up all the Q disinformation stuff.
[1:40:34.840 --> 1:40:41.840]  You know, I'm a long haul info wars fan. And I remember just when you were having that cell phone guy,
[1:40:41.840 --> 1:40:46.840]  cable operator smoking cigarettes and talking about all the surveillance stuff,
[1:40:46.840 --> 1:40:53.840]  and you were way ahead of the curve, snowed in and Q stuff started sucking all the air out of the room
[1:40:53.840 --> 1:40:58.840]  and taking us down a maze to a dead end.
[1:40:58.840 --> 1:41:06.840]  And me, myself, I remember with Jerome Corsi, I'd call in and make some wild comments,
[1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:11.840]  and then there would be a bunch of bots on the chat room saying, like, oh, you should contact Jerome Corsi.
[1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:16.840]  And I think the Q thing, like you said, was one giant big trap.
[1:41:16.840 --> 1:41:23.840]  And evidence for that, you can look into think tank groups in the late 90s and early thousands,
[1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:30.840]  where Infinity and other car companies focus group the letter Q as being very popular to boomers.
[1:41:30.840 --> 1:41:36.840]  That's why we have the Infinity Q car series, Audi Q series, because people were drawn to the letter Q.
[1:41:36.840 --> 1:41:42.840]  So I thought it was kind of suspicious timing. And the nail in the coffin for Q was the election.
[1:41:42.840 --> 1:41:47.840]  I'm sure you remember how they were saying that Q was saying that President Trump was going to come
[1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:51.840]  and fix everything everyone was going to get arrested. Never happened.
[1:41:51.840 --> 1:41:55.840]  Everybody knows a wizard, being a wizard is very expensive, all the wizard stuff.
[1:41:55.840 --> 1:42:01.840]  If you have wizard power, if you flex those power and show up, why? Because you need money for all this wizard stuff.
[1:42:01.840 --> 1:42:04.840]  Well, here's what's going on. I appreciate your call, sir.
[1:42:04.840 --> 1:42:10.840]  There's a lot of things that the Q movement said that were true, because it was everything myself and countless others had already documented.
[1:42:10.840 --> 1:42:14.840]  And then people would say, why don't you talk about Bohemian Grove? Q does.
[1:42:14.840 --> 1:42:18.840]  And I'm like, why not about the Federal Reserve? Q does. Why not about child trafficking?
[1:42:18.840 --> 1:42:24.840]  And it was just like Q got all the credit, which I didn't care about it getting credit, except then it made it like it was God.
[1:42:24.840 --> 1:42:29.840]  Like, whatever it says is true. Q exposed the New World Order. No one knew about it until Q came along.
[1:42:29.840 --> 1:42:36.840]  And I'm like, excuse me? So it was all disgusting. And the big tell was three, four years ago,
[1:42:36.840 --> 1:42:43.840]  when everybody else was being censored, Apple, Google, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram would push Q stuff
[1:42:43.840 --> 1:42:50.840]  and just push it to the top and wouldn't censor it. Now, once they stole the election and they were done with Q,
[1:42:50.840 --> 1:42:54.840]  they purged all those people and shut them down and they ran off.
[1:42:54.840 --> 1:42:57.840]  He got even more insane and said JFK Jr. was coming to save him.
[1:42:57.840 --> 1:43:02.840]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially with word of mouth and prayer.
[1:43:02.840 --> 1:43:10.840]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[1:43:10.840 --> 1:43:13.840]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[1:43:13.840 --> 1:43:20.840]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWarsStore.com like books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, so much more.

[1:43:54.840 --> 1:43:57.840]  Thank you so much for your support. Please take action.
[1:43:57.840 --> 1:44:05.840]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food.
[1:44:05.840 --> 1:44:13.840]  It's all come out. And they're doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of God, the Creator and we are powerful.
[1:44:13.840 --> 1:44:16.840]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[1:44:16.840 --> 1:44:24.840]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy, is it true?
[1:44:24.840 --> 1:44:30.840]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[1:44:30.840 --> 1:44:39.840]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong.
[1:44:39.840 --> 1:44:43.840]  And they know in the end they signed on to God of this world who is a loser.
[1:44:43.840 --> 1:44:47.840]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep infowars on the air now more than ever.
[1:44:47.840 --> 1:44:53.840]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is Satanic.
[1:44:53.840 --> 1:44:57.840]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.

[1:47:59.840 --> 1:48:04.840]  All right, let's go right back to your phone calls here on this live Tuesday, May 10 transmission.
[1:48:04.840 --> 1:48:08.840]  Tata News and clips we haven't gotten to with these powerful Putin clips next hour.
[1:48:08.840 --> 1:48:14.840]  But let's go right back to your calls and the order they were received right now.
[1:48:14.840 --> 1:48:16.840]  Welcome in California.
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:19.840]  Welcome Evan.
[1:48:19.840 --> 1:48:21.840]  Alex pleasure to talk to you.
[1:48:21.840 --> 1:48:23.840]  I'm a director.
[1:48:23.840 --> 1:48:30.840]  I went to film school and I learned a lot of weird stuff that I've heard you referred to before how people would offer you things.
[1:48:30.840 --> 1:48:32.840]  I was a regular in a couple of different TV shows.
[1:48:32.840 --> 1:48:36.840]  I'd be invited to a party that it was almost like a pre-gloomer party.
[1:48:36.840 --> 1:48:38.840]  I'd see questionable stuff.
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:40.840]  I would say something.
[1:48:40.840 --> 1:48:41.840]  I'd get a yellow slip.
[1:48:41.840 --> 1:48:43.840]  I'd be dropped from that TV show.
[1:48:43.840 --> 1:48:52.840]  In school, I tried to come up with some shows to produce and to pitch and I learned a lot of the stuff that you had referred to earlier.
[1:48:52.840 --> 1:49:03.840]  And I want to point out something that I think is extremely powerful is that the image of a woman, a sexy woman used to be painted on a plane when guys would go to fight in World War Two.
[1:49:03.840 --> 1:49:23.840]  And Hollywood learned with the directive of the intelligence community that if they didn't show pretty, let me say like a big breasted sexy voluptuous woman, if they didn't show them, then occasionally when they would introduce a sexy woman like a Selma Hayek, she pretty much had to be a communist.
[1:49:23.840 --> 1:49:32.840]  And they realized that the image of a woman is unbelievably powerful for motivating a guy to be a man.
[1:49:32.840 --> 1:49:34.840]  And they took away the feminine form.
[1:49:34.840 --> 1:49:40.840]  And if I could refer to one thing, Alex, if you've got a second, I want to point out one technique in filmmaking.
[1:49:40.840 --> 1:49:52.840]  When you go to film school, they're teaching you really a lot about the propaganda and the studies that were done in war propaganda and things like that, that a dog would rather be abused than ignored.
[1:49:52.840 --> 1:50:12.840]  And you'd see really strange things being introduced as to be a director. And one of the things I found fascinating was if you have a character come in, some pretty woman in a red dress, and you want her to be the noble character, you put the color wheel around her where her dress stays a vivid red.
[1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:30.840]  And something you don't really realize when you watch a movie or a TV show, if they don't do that, if they have a transgender character come in in a nice vivid dress and all the colors around them are the opposite of those colors, your brain keeps that color vivid and you think you like that person.
[1:50:30.840 --> 1:50:45.840]  Let me boil this down to what you're saying. First they get rid of the image of a voluptuous powerful archetypal goddess, and then they replace it with disgusting, horrible goblin-like men, but in the beautiful colors that you've been taught to think are good.
[1:50:45.840 --> 1:50:58.840]  And so it is a salt on the very basis of the male-female relationship that forms humankind and civilization. And yes, that's what all of this is, is poison to bring us down.
[1:50:58.840 --> 1:51:14.840]  And so women are encouraged to dress like men, and then men are encouraged to dress like women, and then little kids are taught that big fat disgusting men are feminine, and then the women have their breasts cut off and don't look like women.
[1:51:14.840 --> 1:51:21.840]  This is the plan. They've done it with the chemicals in the food and water. This is a very sophisticated takeover operation.
[1:51:21.840 --> 1:51:36.840]  Well said. And I can just point out one more thing, is if you see a woman in a red dress that they want you initially to like, but then when the colors aren't balanced around her, you don't realize that within 30 seconds those colors are bleeding out.
[1:51:36.840 --> 1:51:49.840]  And subconsciously you don't realize that you actually think it's your instinct. You say, wow, I just don't like that woman anymore. You think like you're solving the mystery and you don't realize it's actually your brain.
[1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:58.840]  That's right. And then patriots that they don't like, they'll also blur things out, distort your face with images. They'll put different types of music under it.
[1:51:58.840 --> 1:52:07.840]  But once you're aware of it, you see it everywhere and realize these are weapon systems. What you're saying is, even in film school you were taught this, and once you got deeper into it, they did test to see if you were corruptible.
[1:52:07.840 --> 1:52:17.840]  And when you weren't, you weren't part of the club because you were being recruited for a weapon system to carry out evil, not to be an artist. God bless you, powerful points.
[1:52:17.840 --> 1:52:24.840]  All right, let's take more calls here. Let's talk to Mike in England. Mike, welcome and thank you for holding.
[1:52:24.840 --> 1:52:31.840]  Hi, Alex. Thank you for taking my call. And God bless you. I really do appreciate everything that the Lord does through you.
[1:52:31.840 --> 1:52:41.840]  You know, like the Democrats are trying every possible way to distract people and trying to rig the election and they're failing.
[1:52:41.840 --> 1:52:53.840]  But I think the failsafe for them is, I would expect from everything that I'm seeing over here, that they're going to push for World War III by, before the midterms, to really make it happen.
[1:52:53.840 --> 1:53:10.840]  And I think people need to be held accountable for treason right now. People have got to be inditing them. If anyone has the means to do so, to put a stop to this like Fauci, you know, for genocide, it's certainly mass murder.
[1:53:10.840 --> 1:53:19.840]  Well, exactly. Why do you think the Pope has been lockstep with the globalist, synced up with suddenly come out and say, stop the war. The West started it.
[1:53:19.840 --> 1:53:28.840]  They provoked Russia. They overthrew the elected president. They've been attacking Russian held areas. Stop. Stop. Stop. Because even the Vatican knows this could end the fricking world.
[1:53:28.840 --> 1:53:36.840]  And why should they do that for a bunch out of control leftist globalists who've lost control? The New World Order in its current permutation has failed.
[1:53:36.840 --> 1:53:42.840]  And even within the power structure, there are people that understand the brakes need to be put on now.
[1:53:42.840 --> 1:53:53.840]  Any minute now, because I mean, it's stupid, boring job. Johnson, you know, saying, oh, we should nuke Russia. They're listening to that.
[1:53:53.840 --> 1:53:59.840]  Nancy Pelosi going to say, oh, well, we're here to win. I mean, these are idiots. That's beyond treason.
[1:53:59.840 --> 1:54:07.840]  There needs to be gallows. And I'm due process, of course, but there needs to be gallows for these people because they're going to lead to the death of millions.
[1:54:07.840 --> 1:54:17.840]  Well, long before we talk about gallows for people, we should be talking about politically exposing the globalist so people can victim in the court of public opinion.
[1:54:17.840 --> 1:54:22.840]  Then out of that will flow the justice we need. Thank you, Mike, for the call.
[1:54:22.840 --> 1:54:41.840]  I've got a lot on that the start of the next hour. Biden's DOJ is threatening January 6th defendants with life in prison after walking inside the U.S. Capitol and taking pictures while the mayor of Chicago is calling for physical call to arms and violence over Roe v. Wade.
[1:54:41.840 --> 1:54:57.840]  We've got so much news on that front coming up in the next hour and we will get to everybody here like local Gentile and Dean and Jay and Todd and Matt and Tito and trucker in the Badlands.
[1:54:57.840 --> 1:55:11.840]  Chris and everybody, your phone calls are coming up and these incredible Putin clips I've got from their big World War Two Victory Day speech. See what you think about that coming up next hour.
[1:55:11.840 --> 1:55:30.840]  And then there's a really amazing confirmed HD zoom of the moon during the day and what looks like spacecraft flying around the dark side of the moon. I can tell you there is a secret drone base where robots, robot space planes that delivered payloads, 3D printer machines,
[1:55:30.840 --> 1:55:43.840]  and other systems in a test for Elon Musk base. And I believe that these images are drone delivered, robot delivered payloads being delivered to that base.
[1:55:43.840 --> 1:56:00.840]  And I'm not just speculating there. When Trump was in office, I was let in by some folks that are involved at the highest levels and they just said, and I said, why are you telling me something this classifying?
[1:56:00.840 --> 1:56:13.840]  And they said, well, we want it out there. And Musk wants it out there and you're being given this information. And I never really did anything with it. I mean, when you get stuff like that, and you know, these are the real people involved.
[1:56:13.840 --> 1:56:34.840]  Well known people in the whole secret space program. And Musk has talked about how he wants to do this. I can tell you from my sources, this is already going on. So that's coming up in the next hour as well.

[2:00:00.840 --> 2:00:17.840]  Coming up, we're going to cover the latest war news as it escalates out of control and what Putin had to say about it. That's the next segment in your phone calls.
[2:00:17.840 --> 2:00:26.840]  I want to play before we go to break and come back and take your calls. A little bit of what Tucker Carlson had to say and I don't disagree with Tucker, but I can have this as a teaching moment in my view.
[2:00:26.840 --> 2:00:33.840]  Tucker says that Biden doesn't care about religious groups. No, he hates Christians.
[2:00:33.840 --> 2:00:45.840]  South of the globalists don't care about the economy. They want to break record to take control of you. So this isn't incompetence. This is by design, shouldn't reoff and attacking Americans freedoms, particularly Christians. Here it is.
[2:00:45.840 --> 2:01:02.840]  We could go exactly. An unnamed saboteur at the Supreme Court leaked a draft opinion by Justice Sam Alito, explaining why Roe v. Wade ought to be overturned. Now, people weren't completely hysterical over it, but actually, as a legal matter, Alito's views were not especially controversial.
[2:01:02.840 --> 2:01:10.840]  Roe is bad law over the past half century. Many have acknowledged that, including many pro-choice Democrats, including Joe Biden.
[2:01:10.840 --> 2:01:25.840]  So at this point, 49 years in, if you're an office holder who supports legal abortion, the obvious solution is to vote for legal abortion. Pass a law like they do in democracies. It's not complicated. That's how it's supposed to work.
[2:01:25.840 --> 2:01:36.840]  But Democrats have no interest in that. Democracy is a tiresome process, and worst of all, the outcome isn't always guaranteed. They prefer what they call direct action, not democracy.
[2:01:36.840 --> 2:01:51.840]  So liberal activists immediately set about threatening Supreme Court justices and then attacking Christianity. A group called Ruth Sentus, which is named in honor of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, posted the home addresses of every Supreme Court justice who was conservative.
[2:01:51.840 --> 2:02:01.840]  Why they do this? Well, of course, to invite violence and harassment to get them to change their votes. Then Ruth Sentus sent this to practicing Catholics across the country.
[2:02:01.840 --> 2:02:11.840]  Quote, Stuff your rosaries and your weaponized prayer will be burning the Eucharist to show our disgust for the abused Catholic churches have condoned for centuries.
[2:02:11.840 --> 2:02:21.840]  Now, you'd think the Biden administration might have something to say about this. It was all public. Joe Biden purports to be a Catholic. Intimidating judges, by the way, is a federal crime.
[2:02:21.840 --> 2:02:32.840]  But no, the Biden administration did not try and stop. The Justice Department did nothing. In fact, from her podium at the White House, the president's publicist endorsed the coming harassment very clearly.
[2:02:32.840 --> 2:02:40.840]  Quote, The president's view is that there's a lot of passion, a lot of fear, a lot of sadness from many, many people, Jen Psaki explained.
[2:02:40.840 --> 2:02:48.840]  So the message to Joe Biden's abortion militia could not have been clear. Go forth and terrorize. That's the word from the White House. So that's exactly what they did.
[2:02:48.840 --> 2:03:03.840]  Here's the mob this weekend outside Brett Kavanaugh's house.
[2:03:03.840 --> 2:03:08.840]  Brett Kavanaugh is the Supreme Court Justice, but he's also a man and a husband and a father, as you just saw.
[2:03:08.840 --> 2:03:14.840]  He lives in a pretty normal neighborhood outside D.C., doesn't have a wall around the house, and more to the point, his two daughters are home.
[2:03:14.840 --> 2:03:21.840]  So imagine what it must have been like inside the house if you're Brett Kavanaugh or his wife or his daughters.
[2:03:21.840 --> 2:03:27.840]  The people outside didn't care. The woman who organized that protest outside Kavanaugh's house lives right down the street, apparently.
[2:03:27.840 --> 2:03:31.840]  She's a deeply unhappy individual called Lacey Wooten Holloway.
[2:03:31.840 --> 2:03:43.840]  Wooten Holloway brought the mob to Kavanaugh's house for a very specific reason, not because she was angry, which she is, but because she wants Brett Kavanaugh to change his views and support Roe V. Wade.
[2:03:43.840 --> 2:03:48.840]  She was intimidating a federal judge all the more. And once again, that's a federal crime. It could not be clearer.
[2:03:48.840 --> 2:03:55.840]  And yet, Lacey Wooten Holloway, who bragged about organizing this, was not arrested. She wasn't even scolded. Instead, she was rewarded.
[2:03:55.840 --> 2:04:00.840]  Lacey Wooten Holloway got a glowing profile in the Washington Post.
[2:04:00.840 --> 2:04:06.840]  So once again, in effect, our leaders in Washington sent a very clear message to the mob, as they did for BLM.
[2:04:06.840 --> 2:04:11.840]  Do what you want. We're on your side. It's not like you're insurrectionists.
[2:04:11.840 --> 2:04:17.840]  So the mob did. Look what the mob did to this Christian counseling center in Wisconsin over the weekend.
[2:04:17.840 --> 2:04:26.840]  If abortions aren't safe, then you aren't either. That's just part of the message outside Wisconsin Family Action here, and it continues inside the building.
[2:04:26.840 --> 2:04:29.840]  What you're seeing around me right now, this isn't the answer to anything.
[2:04:29.840 --> 2:04:36.840]  Also written in debris and glass in her office, Wisconsin Family Action President Julian Appling says the message is clear.
[2:04:36.840 --> 2:04:42.840]  It's precipitated by the leaked Supreme Court opinion, right? I mean, it's obvious.
[2:04:42.840 --> 2:04:48.840]  Madison police say it appears someone threw a Molotov cocktail inside the building.
[2:04:48.840 --> 2:04:53.840]  You're not safe. Now, the Christian counseling center had nothing to do with Samuel Lito's opinion.
[2:04:53.840 --> 2:04:57.840]  We'll be back.
[2:04:57.840 --> 2:05:07.840]  Here at Info Wars, our slogan is tomorrow's news today, whether it's politics or health or spirituality.
[2:05:07.840 --> 2:05:11.840]  Weird about bringing you the very best documented, accurate, real world information.

[2:05:28.840 --> 2:05:36.840]  Most other iodine out there is bound to other minerals and compounds so you don't absorb it at all or fully.
[2:05:36.840 --> 2:05:41.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got a limited supply and it's been sold out for months because the supply chain right now.
[2:05:41.840 --> 2:05:47.840]  But despite that, we're selling it at 25% off for one more week than it goes back to full price.
[2:05:47.840 --> 2:05:49.840]  Within two weeks, the current sales rate is going to sell out.

[2:06:10.840 --> 2:06:16.840]  So here's some of the Russian victory day parade statements of Vladimir Putin.
[2:06:16.840 --> 2:06:21.840]  We're going to get to in a moment, but first, here he is saying hurrah to the troops and them saying it back.
[2:06:47.840 --> 2:06:57.840]  As the world marches towards thermo nuclear war and as the U.S. admits they're officially our government in a war.
[2:06:57.840 --> 2:07:03.840]  With Russia, there's an article by Patrick Buchanan of Buchanan.org up on infowars.com.
[2:07:03.840 --> 2:07:09.840]  You should read Buchanan. It's Ukraine's war now, America's war.
[2:07:09.840 --> 2:07:14.840]  There's other reports here that Putin's likely to impose martial law in Russia to support war effort.
[2:07:14.840 --> 2:07:18.840]  The intelligence chief says who knows if any of that is true.
[2:07:18.840 --> 2:07:21.840]  Here's Putin accuses the West of plotting to threaten Russia.
[2:07:21.840 --> 2:07:28.840]  What's most important, he points out that the West values and freedoms have been canceled by the cabals of hijacked countries.
[2:07:28.840 --> 2:07:30.840]  Which is true, here it is.
[2:07:30.840 --> 2:07:39.840]  The United States, especially after the fall of the Soviet Union, started speaking about their exclusivity, their exclusive status.
[2:07:39.840 --> 2:07:50.840]  Humiliating not only the whole world, but its own satellite, who have to pretend they can't notice and swallow it up, lap it up.
[2:07:50.840 --> 2:07:54.840]  But we are a different country. Russia has a different character.
[2:07:54.840 --> 2:08:05.840]  We shall never give up our love for our motherland, our faith in our traditional values, the customs of our forewares and respect for all nations and cultures.
[2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:11.840]  In the West, these thousands old values have been canceled.
[2:08:11.840 --> 2:08:21.840]  This moral degradation is at the basis of the cynical falsification of the history of World War II, rampant Russophobia,
[2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:31.840]  traitors and mockery of the memory of victims and those who built victory.
[2:08:31.840 --> 2:08:37.840]  We know that the American veterans who wanted to attend the parade in Moscow were banned from doing so.
[2:08:37.840 --> 2:08:46.840]  But I want them to know we are proud of your achievements, of your exploits and your contribution to our common victory.
[2:08:46.840 --> 2:09:03.840]  We honour all members of the Allied armies, Americans, British, the courageous members of resistance and Chinese soldiers, all who contributed to the defeat of Natism and imperialism.
[2:09:03.840 --> 2:09:29.840]  Today, the soldiers of Donbass and Russian, together with Russian soldiers, are fighting in the battlefield where the servicemen of Svorov and Brusilov and Svetislav and many, many heroes of the Russian country.
[2:09:29.840 --> 2:09:47.840]  I address the servicemen of Donbass. You are fighting for the motherland for its future so that lessons of the World War II are not forgotten, so that there is no place in history for the punitive divisions of Nazis.
[2:09:47.840 --> 2:10:00.840]  So that's where the world is. Here's the New York Times headline, Biden speeds up military aid to Ukraine, drawing US deeper into war. $40 billion now extra in weapons.
[2:10:00.840 --> 2:10:08.840]  And remember, Bono's one foundation under fire for giving little over 1% of funds to charities. That's why he calls it one.
[2:10:08.840 --> 2:10:19.840]  He's over there raising money, he steals. Again, these people are a pack of world economic forum, Bilderberg group, criminals, and are enemies of humanity.
[2:10:19.840 --> 2:10:31.840]  And then, meanwhile, in New York City and Times Square, they're running Big Jumbo Tron ads, a pro-Nazi advertisement appears in Times Square which bemoans the defeat of Hitlerism.
[2:10:31.840 --> 2:10:49.840]  There hasn't been this much open pro-Naziism in America since British bourgeoisie in 1930 says Alexander McKay. But regardless, now trying to say that the Russians commemorating World War II is bad is something else, ladies and gentlemen, absolutely out of control.
[2:10:49.840 --> 2:11:02.840]  Speaking of Nazis, local Gentiles, what he goes by from New York, once you talk about Greg Rees' report, he did a week ago on Nazism. Local Gentile, welcome to the airwaves.
[2:11:02.840 --> 2:11:19.840]  Yeah, how you doing Alex? Real quick, I just want to touch on one other thing about how space, space, like what a setup they have with us with all the alien movies and, you know, on the AI and all this stuff. I believe it's that you cannot reach space unless you
[2:11:19.840 --> 2:11:32.840]  really transcend. Your spirit can only go to space. That's what I believe anyway. And it's all a setup for the fake alien invasion, which correlates with the shots using GPS inside of people that I think can be tracked by hunter-killer drones.
[2:11:32.840 --> 2:11:46.840]  And the heavy metals that are being sprayed is to create a false grid, a reflection point for the 5G radio waves to track everybody, to create, you know, like a footprint across the whole, the whole entire realm or whatever.
[2:11:46.840 --> 2:11:57.840]  At least the parts that we occupy that we're herded into. And you can see it coming a mile away. You got the 5G, you got the GPS that's been infused inside people.
[2:11:57.840 --> 2:12:07.840]  Now all they got to do is send out these hunter-killer drones, blame it on a fake alien invasion, kill most of us also by curating the reflection point with the radio waves.
[2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:20.840]  So it's also going to nuke the hell out of us too. You know what I mean? That's the real nuke in my opinion. I think nuclear bombs is all BS. Nuclear bombs are really radiation because radar came out four years before the Manhattan Project.
[2:12:20.840 --> 2:12:27.840]  And when they came out, they realized, hey, we got one hell of a weapon on ourselves. And whenever they get a weapon, you know, they got to test it out.
[2:12:27.840 --> 2:12:31.840]  And then I have another thing. I want to know what you think about that. And then I got one more thing.
[2:12:31.840 --> 2:12:40.840]  I got to move on here. We got to get to all the collars. I think the world is round. I don't think people will think it's flat or bad people, but I myself am an amateur astronomer.
[2:12:40.840 --> 2:12:54.840]  We can put footage on screen of Saturn coming out behind the moon. I mean, I've sat there drinking a six-pack of beer for like five hours with a mead telescope that tracks stuff.
[2:12:54.840 --> 2:13:03.840]  And I can sit there and watch the moons of Jupiter spinning. I can watch the round planets turning with my own eyeballs.
[2:13:03.840 --> 2:13:09.840]  I've got a green filter. Back when I had time to do it, it's been in storage for probably 15 years. I've got a big 12-inch reflector.
[2:13:09.840 --> 2:13:16.840]  And I can put a green filter on it, look at the sun, and sit there and watch the sun in an hour turn quite a few degrees.
[2:13:16.840 --> 2:13:25.840]  I'm looking at a big ball in the sky. How do you respond to that?
[2:13:25.840 --> 2:13:31.840]  I mean, you could see things, but that doesn't mean you can get there. You know what I mean? I believe they're projections.
[2:13:31.840 --> 2:13:35.840]  I mean, to read for us to see, but it's the cosmos. That's what the Almighty is.
[2:13:35.840 --> 2:13:39.840]  So you think we're all in a giant Truman Show?
[2:13:39.840 --> 2:13:44.840]  No, I don't think that at all. I think it's just, it's a realm. We can't describe it. We cannot come through.
[2:13:44.840 --> 2:13:52.840]  Well, I mean, it's true that they're using the aluminum dioxide, not just for weather modification, but for over-the-horizon radar.
[2:13:52.840 --> 2:13:57.840]  A lot of what you said, I think, is accurate other than the Earth being flat.
[2:13:57.840 --> 2:14:01.840]  Separately, what was your, you got a point about Gregory's?
[2:14:01.840 --> 2:14:05.840]  It's a realm. Oh, I was just saying with the Nazism, I believe he's correct.
[2:14:05.840 --> 2:14:15.840]  Of course, if you look at the word Ashkenazi, which is Eastern European Jews, right? Which, you know, they're not all bad people, but they do have religious fanatics, right?
[2:14:15.840 --> 2:14:19.840]  That of hijacked religion, just like Muslim extremists, right? We have Jewish extremists, right?
[2:14:19.840 --> 2:14:25.840]  So they throw it, they leave a calling card. The word Nazi, Ashkenazi, Nazism.
[2:14:25.840 --> 2:14:28.840]  Is anybody picking up on this yet? Because what was your...
[2:14:28.840 --> 2:14:45.840]  I appreciate your call. I don't know what I can say to someone saying, because the acronym for National Socialist Workers' Party, or whatever, is similar to a group of Eastern European Jews' name.
[2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:55.840]  It's just, Hitler did not like the Jews, and went after the Jews. And I think similarities in those names is just not fair.
[2:14:55.840 --> 2:15:01.840]  I mean, I will say this. There were a lot of powerful Jews on record that would rob Jews trying to get out of Europe.
[2:15:01.840 --> 2:15:06.840]  And the Nazis would take that money from those Jews and let them survive and let them keep a lot of it.
[2:15:06.840 --> 2:15:12.840]  And that was what George Soros did. It's what Madeleine Albright's father did. I mean, there's 60-minute shows about this.
[2:15:12.840 --> 2:15:17.840]  So those are terrible, horrible people.
[2:15:17.840 --> 2:15:24.840]  And I reject the ADL's guilt that America's Nazi and the founding fathers are Nazi, and we take on that we're Nazis and they're the good guys, we're the bad guys.
[2:15:24.840 --> 2:15:32.840]  And, you know, certainly there are some of those leftist organizations that cloak their anti-free speech behavior encountering anti-Semitism.
[2:15:32.840 --> 2:15:38.840]  But I just stay out of the racial and religious stuff and try to promote freedom for everybody.
[2:15:38.840 --> 2:15:43.840]  And I know a lot of great Jews, like Dr. Zalinko, that are really fighting the New World Order.
[2:15:43.840 --> 2:15:47.840]  And obviously, there's bad Jews as well. They're bad people in every group. And I appreciate your call.

[2:16:52.840 --> 2:17:16.840]  Thank you so much for your support. Please take action.
[2:17:23.840 --> 2:17:27.840]  You are totally dizzy and confused. You have a concussion.
[2:17:27.840 --> 2:17:30.840]  And that's what the globalists have done. They have stunned us.
[2:17:30.840 --> 2:17:34.840]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings.
[2:17:34.840 --> 2:17:40.840]  And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave a speech he called The Great New Narrative, where he brags how the public is lost,
[2:17:40.840 --> 2:17:48.840]  how the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[2:17:48.840 --> 2:17:55.840]  That's what the Great Reset is. They need darkness to thrive.
[2:17:55.840 --> 2:18:06.840]  Over the years, info wars has produced more than 200 amazing patriot Americana Second Amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts,
[2:18:06.840 --> 2:18:12.840]  ball caps, flags, you name it. All of the apparel and the flags are being sold at cost right now.
[2:18:12.840 --> 2:18:20.840]  That's just regular plain chain shirts. That is all sorts of designer shirts that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[2:18:20.840 --> 2:18:24.840]  We used to sell for $40. We're selling them for $15, selling them for $20.
[2:18:24.840 --> 2:18:29.840]  Whatever the shirt costs us, if a shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5 for essentially produce.
[2:18:29.840 --> 2:18:31.840]  It costs $10, we're selling it for $10.
[2:18:31.840 --> 2:18:35.840]  And we've got hoodies, and we've got long sleeves, and we've got short sleeves.
[2:18:35.840 --> 2:18:37.840]  We've got them all, and we've got to liquidate them all.
[2:18:37.840 --> 2:18:42.840]  And they're limited edition because we're never going to make any of these designs again.
[2:18:42.840 --> 2:18:47.840]  We are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[2:18:47.840 --> 2:18:52.840]  We've got to sell this to keep info wars on the air, plus it spreads the word infowarstore.com,
[2:18:52.840 --> 2:18:55.840]  your historic apparel now infowarstore.com.
[2:18:56.840 --> 2:18:59.840]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand info wars.
[2:18:59.840 --> 2:19:05.840]  I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[2:19:05.840 --> 2:19:07.840]  I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films.
[2:19:07.840 --> 2:19:09.840]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[2:19:09.840 --> 2:19:14.840]  And it was a t-shirt I designed the first one, Mass Murderers Agreed Gun Control Works,
[2:19:14.840 --> 2:19:18.840]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew.
[2:19:18.840 --> 2:19:20.840]  That's our oldest design that we're still selling.
[2:19:20.840 --> 2:19:25.840]  We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions,
[2:19:25.840 --> 2:19:27.840]  because whatever stock we've got in, that's it.
[2:19:27.840 --> 2:19:32.840]  We're selling everything out to find the operation to get rid of inventory.
[2:19:32.840 --> 2:19:36.840]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future, they'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[2:19:36.840 --> 2:19:40.840]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance on what I almost forgot.
[2:19:40.840 --> 2:19:44.840]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[2:19:44.840 --> 2:19:51.840]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts,
[2:19:51.840 --> 2:19:55.840]  they're all selling at cost infowarstore.com.
[2:19:55.840 --> 2:20:03.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:03.840 --> 2:20:29.840]  All right, we got a lot of great callers on the line, and I'm going to move to you all very quickly now, here on the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:29.840 --> 2:20:36.840]  In the next segment, I'm going to hit some really big abortion January 6 news and the midterms and how that all ties together,
[2:20:36.840 --> 2:20:42.840]  because this is really serious, the precedent being set on January 6 for everybody,
[2:20:42.840 --> 2:20:47.840]  and it's the globalist big play here domestically and overseas, and it's, again, extremely dangerous.
[2:20:47.840 --> 2:20:52.840]  What the New World Order has done in Ukraine, they want to do here with arresting you for your speech next.
[2:20:52.840 --> 2:20:55.840]  They know they're losing, they know people are waking up, they're in a lot of trouble,
[2:20:55.840 --> 2:21:00.840]  so that's why we got to push now to wake people up harder than ever and not submit to their bullying.
[2:21:00.840 --> 2:21:03.840]  The answer to suppression of speech is more speech.
[2:21:03.840 --> 2:21:07.840]  All right, the order of the calls are received here, let's go to Dean in New York.
[2:21:07.840 --> 2:21:09.840]  Dean, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[2:21:09.840 --> 2:21:12.840]  Hello, thank you, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[2:21:12.840 --> 2:21:15.840]  I'd like to say you're a master of your discipline.
[2:21:15.840 --> 2:21:21.840]  10th degree black belt may be higher of numerous disciplines.
[2:21:21.840 --> 2:21:24.840]  I hope your wife's doing well after the holidays.
[2:21:24.840 --> 2:21:26.840]  Yes.
[2:21:26.840 --> 2:21:31.840]  And I wanted to bring up about Pete Budecek and his partner there.
[2:21:31.840 --> 2:21:38.840]  They have an infant and I'm wondering if they have their formulas since he's the transportation secretary.
[2:21:38.840 --> 2:21:43.840]  Well, I mean men can have breast and breastfeed according to the FDA and CDC.
[2:21:43.840 --> 2:21:47.840]  It's disinfo, we don't believe a man can have a uterus and a man can have babies.
[2:21:47.840 --> 2:21:52.840]  So I guess Pete Budecek, remember they even showed them, oh, we just had our baby in a hospital bed.
[2:21:52.840 --> 2:21:57.840]  I mean, they just love to gaslight us and train us to accept fraud.
[2:21:57.840 --> 2:22:04.840]  I'm wondering if anybody did an independent test on the formula that was recalled.
[2:22:04.840 --> 2:22:07.840]  Could it have been recalled or not, you know what I'm saying?
[2:22:07.840 --> 2:22:12.840]  Well, it's not just the big recall, it's supply chain breakdowns and it's one person gets COVID,
[2:22:12.840 --> 2:22:15.840]  even though they're not sick, they're asymptomatic, they shut down the plants.
[2:22:15.840 --> 2:22:21.840]  This is all designed to destroy our economy and vertically integrate it and consolidate it, Dean.
[2:22:21.840 --> 2:22:25.840]  Hey, I got turned on by your show by a friend of mine, Curly.
[2:22:25.840 --> 2:22:27.840]  He passed away in 2000.
[2:22:27.840 --> 2:22:29.840]  He was a radio personality.
[2:22:29.840 --> 2:22:30.840]  He loved you.
[2:22:30.840 --> 2:22:33.840]  If you could say, perform some day privately.
[2:22:33.840 --> 2:22:35.840]  Was I ever even a guest on Curly's show?
[2:22:35.840 --> 2:22:43.840]  He did a night show and I think he more of called you up here in Utica, New York.
[2:22:43.840 --> 2:22:46.840]  We love you, Curly, and you're a great guy.
[2:22:46.840 --> 2:22:47.840]  God bless you.
[2:22:47.840 --> 2:22:48.840]  Thank you, Dean.
[2:22:48.840 --> 2:22:51.840]  Absolutely, let's go to Jay in Ohio.
[2:22:51.840 --> 2:22:52.840]  Jay, thanks for calling.
[2:22:52.840 --> 2:22:53.840]  Go ahead.
[2:22:53.840 --> 2:22:56.840]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[2:22:56.840 --> 2:22:57.840]  I wear your shirt.
[2:22:57.840 --> 2:23:03.840]  I spread the word and the message and I watched the episode you had there with, I guess, Bonds,
[2:23:03.840 --> 2:23:10.840]  they're the attorney, and I'm wondering, could we somehow get a show on where Bonds is on
[2:23:10.840 --> 2:23:18.840]  and call in all the sheriffs and have the sheriffs to call in and maybe boost them up
[2:23:18.840 --> 2:23:22.840]  and have them understand how strong their constitutional duty is.
[2:23:22.840 --> 2:23:28.840]  Well, more and more sheriffs do realize that it's their job being elected.
[2:23:28.840 --> 2:23:33.840]  The highest elected official in the county is really the sheriff and that the sheriffs
[2:23:33.840 --> 2:23:34.840]  are really starting to get it.
[2:23:34.840 --> 2:23:37.840]  Soros has come in and tried to elect a bunch of sheriffs.
[2:23:37.840 --> 2:23:39.840]  That's failed overall.
[2:23:39.840 --> 2:23:44.840]  He's succeeded at getting district attorneys and county attorneys in charge.
[2:23:44.840 --> 2:23:47.840]  And he is just a reign of criminal terror.
[2:23:47.840 --> 2:23:52.840]  Here in Austin, they're letting bank robbers out in a day, armed robbers out in a few hours.
[2:23:52.840 --> 2:23:54.840]  People that shoot multiple people are being released.
[2:23:54.840 --> 2:23:57.840]  I mean, it is crazy dangerous.
[2:23:57.840 --> 2:24:00.840]  But if you're a conservative or a Christian, they'll throw the book at you for anything.
[2:24:00.840 --> 2:24:02.840]  People say, well, why do you live here?
[2:24:02.840 --> 2:24:03.840]  Well, my family's from here.
[2:24:03.840 --> 2:24:05.840]  Our infrastructure's from here.
[2:24:05.840 --> 2:24:06.840]  I've been here since high school.
[2:24:06.840 --> 2:24:09.840]  If I had the money, I would move outside of Austin.
[2:24:09.840 --> 2:24:14.840]  I still love the town, but you're absolutely right.
[2:24:14.840 --> 2:24:19.840]  But why couldn't they put together like an army of sheriffs and go out?
[2:24:19.840 --> 2:24:23.840]  I mean, all these things that all these crazy people are doing,
[2:24:23.840 --> 2:24:28.840]  letting out criminals and spending money over to Ukraine.
[2:24:28.840 --> 2:24:31.840]  And totally dissolving the border.
[2:24:31.840 --> 2:24:34.840]  Well, a sheriff only has jurisdiction in their county.
[2:24:34.840 --> 2:24:37.840]  But the sheriffs can create multi-jurisdictional task forces.
[2:24:37.840 --> 2:24:41.840]  The problem is the feds did that and under statute, they have to control it.
[2:24:41.840 --> 2:24:43.840]  And so that's what's the corruption of the sheriffs.
[2:24:43.840 --> 2:24:47.840]  But yes, we need local control and sheriffs are key to that fight.
[2:24:47.840 --> 2:24:49.840]  Great points, Jay.
[2:24:49.840 --> 2:24:50.840]  All right.
[2:24:50.840 --> 2:24:51.840]  Alyssa in New York.
[2:24:51.840 --> 2:24:52.840]  Thank you.
[2:24:52.840 --> 2:24:53.840]  Go ahead.
[2:24:53.840 --> 2:24:54.840]  Hi.
[2:24:54.840 --> 2:24:55.840]  My name's Alicia.
[2:24:55.840 --> 2:24:57.840]  I'm Colleen from Catsfield, New York.
[2:24:57.840 --> 2:25:02.840]  I just wanted to say thank you for everything that you do for fighting for everyone every day.
[2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:03.840]  And I'm praying for you.
[2:25:03.840 --> 2:25:07.840]  And your broadcast and I bought your supplement.
[2:25:07.840 --> 2:25:14.840]  And I just wanted to ask you, do you think that there's hope for our future?
[2:25:14.840 --> 2:25:16.840]  Well, there has to be a hope for our future and our children.
[2:25:16.840 --> 2:25:20.840]  And God tells us that evil will rise up and do a lot of horrible things that it's now doing.
[2:25:20.840 --> 2:25:25.840]  Prophecies being fulfilled and then we'll have to go through it and then come out stronger on the other side.
[2:25:25.840 --> 2:25:27.840]  And so we will make it through this.
[2:25:27.840 --> 2:25:29.840]  The question is how bad will it be?
[2:25:29.840 --> 2:25:31.840]  God leaves that up to us.
[2:25:31.840 --> 2:25:33.840]  And so I think that's where we're at.
[2:25:33.840 --> 2:25:39.840]  But we are seeing systemic design collapse of the world economy and system for the population.
[2:25:39.840 --> 2:25:46.840]  Did you see me play that Club of Rome clip earlier where the Deimos groups openly talking about killing the majority of us?
[2:25:46.840 --> 2:25:48.840]  Yes, it freaks me out.
[2:25:48.840 --> 2:25:50.840]  It's very, very real.
[2:25:50.840 --> 2:25:56.840]  And again, when you see the mainstream media saying it doesn't exist, while it does, they are aiding and abetting this.
[2:25:56.840 --> 2:25:59.840]  It's just monstrous crime being committed.
[2:25:59.840 --> 2:26:04.840]  And of course a group that wants to depopulate us, release a virus and then gave us a deadly shot.
[2:26:04.840 --> 2:26:08.840]  We just have to come to grips with they're really doing it to us.
[2:26:08.840 --> 2:26:09.840]  Yeah.
[2:26:09.840 --> 2:26:14.840]  I'm 26 and I noticed like my friends, I try to tell them this stuff and they think I'm crazy.
[2:26:14.840 --> 2:26:22.840]  I do have a few family members that are older than me that agree with me and they see what's going on.
[2:26:22.840 --> 2:26:24.840]  It's scary.
[2:26:24.840 --> 2:26:26.840]  Well, here's the biggest thing you can do.
[2:26:26.840 --> 2:26:31.840]  Warn friends and family, tell them about this broadcast and other broadcasts and things that you think are informative.
[2:26:31.840 --> 2:26:34.840]  Share video, share articles and say, listen, I care about you.
[2:26:34.840 --> 2:26:36.840]  I need your help to stop this.
[2:26:36.840 --> 2:26:41.840]  We've all got to wake up and stop this multinational corporate fascist takeover of the New World Order.
[2:26:41.840 --> 2:26:48.840]  And some may not listen now, but they're going to listen later with the hyperinflation and the shortages and they need to know who did it.
[2:26:48.840 --> 2:26:50.840]  Because that's how we stop it.
[2:26:50.840 --> 2:26:52.840]  Thank you so much for the call.
[2:26:52.840 --> 2:26:54.840]  Moving quickly here.
[2:26:54.840 --> 2:26:56.840]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[2:26:56.840 --> 2:26:59.840]  Let's talk to Trucker in the Badlands in Texas.
[2:26:59.840 --> 2:27:02.840]  Welcome.
[2:27:02.840 --> 2:27:03.840]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[2:27:03.840 --> 2:27:04.840]  Good.
[2:27:04.840 --> 2:27:12.840]  You know, we're still in fighting back and many ways stronger than ever, but it's crazy to be inside the New World Order now and to know it's all going to go down.
[2:27:12.840 --> 2:27:16.840]  We try to stop it, but at least we won't be caught flat-footed now.
[2:27:16.840 --> 2:27:17.840]  Well, good.
[2:27:17.840 --> 2:27:18.840]  That preface is my question.
[2:27:18.840 --> 2:27:21.840]  I wanted to ask a hypothetical question.
[2:27:21.840 --> 2:27:39.840]  If you could inject yourself in any political role in the United States or not in the world, and you had a team of people that you could also inject into any political organization in the world, what would you do to defeat the globalist once and for all?
[2:27:39.840 --> 2:27:41.840]  Where would you want people in position?
[2:27:41.840 --> 2:27:43.840]  What would you expose?
[2:27:43.840 --> 2:27:46.840]  How would you defeat them in a perfect world?
[2:27:46.840 --> 2:27:50.840]  If we had somebody like President Trump that was fully informed,
[2:27:50.840 --> 2:28:03.840]  a president could start doing weekly fireside chats with video presentations showing Gates and Harari and Dasik and all of them saying,
[2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:09.840]  we're going to create world government, we're going to depopulate, showing the documents they created, the virus,
[2:28:09.840 --> 2:28:18.840]  and explain to the public that there's a multinational movement to take over nation states and turn humans into a commodity and depopulate the rest,
[2:28:18.840 --> 2:28:28.840]  and that we need as a humanity to wake up to that and use our force of will and our buying power to organize and peacefully save the big corporations.
[2:28:28.840 --> 2:28:30.840]  We're aware of what you're doing in your world government.
[2:28:30.840 --> 2:28:32.840]  We're not going to accept it.
[2:28:32.840 --> 2:28:33.840]  And we say, stop it now.
[2:28:33.840 --> 2:28:34.840]  It's over.
[2:28:34.840 --> 2:28:42.840]  And just that, directly addressing the globalists and what they're doing would devastate their operations overnight.
[2:28:42.840 --> 2:28:44.840]  Stay there, trucker in the Badlands.
[2:28:44.840 --> 2:28:46.840]  I'll elaborate on that when we come back.
[2:28:46.840 --> 2:28:47.840]  That would be the biggest way.
[2:28:47.840 --> 2:28:48.840]  That's not happening.
[2:28:48.840 --> 2:28:53.840]  We've got to do it grassroots everywhere and get folks elected like Bolsonaro and Orban.

[2:31:05.840 --> 2:31:10.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're all about to be limited edition because we're selling out of them.
[2:31:10.840 --> 2:31:15.840]  They're about to be history, and we're selling out of the hoodies, the ball caps, the t-shirts,
[2:31:15.840 --> 2:31:20.840]  all these amazing designs at cost at infowarstore.com, except for this fundraiser shirt

[2:32:23.840 --> 2:32:24.840]  Build Back Better.
[2:32:24.840 --> 2:32:30.840]  This is nothing more than a top-down, vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[2:32:30.840 --> 2:32:33.840]  And because they couldn't take our guns, and because we wouldn't bow,
[2:32:33.840 --> 2:32:37.840]  because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system,
[2:32:37.840 --> 2:32:41.840]  couldn't win, they released a biological weapon on us.
[2:32:41.840 --> 2:32:45.840]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[2:32:45.840 --> 2:32:46.840]  It's that simple.
[2:32:46.840 --> 2:32:49.840]  They can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns.
[2:32:49.840 --> 2:32:53.840]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19, and you know the rest is history.
[2:32:53.840 --> 2:33:22.840]  Expose this paradigm, and we win.
[2:33:23.840 --> 2:33:27.840]  To the Alex Jones Show.
[2:33:27.840 --> 2:33:30.840]  Wayne Allen Root is always a powerful guest host.
[2:33:30.840 --> 2:33:34.840]  He'll be hosting the fourth hour coming up, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:33:34.840 --> 2:33:37.840]  in about 30 minutes from now.
[2:33:37.840 --> 2:33:43.840]  I've got a bunch of economic news, and January 6th, abortion news I want to have.
[2:33:43.840 --> 2:33:45.840]  But we are taking your phone calls right now,
[2:33:45.840 --> 2:33:48.840]  and I'm going to go to every single caller that is left on the board.
[2:33:48.840 --> 2:33:54.840]  Curly, Chris, Jim, Amanda, Todd, Jason, Jonathan, Tito, and others.
[2:33:54.840 --> 2:33:56.840]  We're going to the order they're received.
[2:33:56.840 --> 2:33:59.840]  Chris, in New York, you're on the air.
[2:33:59.840 --> 2:34:03.840]  Alex, the Joe Rogan idea of doing a new movie is a great idea,
[2:34:03.840 --> 2:34:04.840]  but I don't think you have the time.
[2:34:04.840 --> 2:34:06.840]  I don't think we have the time.
[2:34:06.840 --> 2:34:09.840]  So, Patriot, you need to get these, get the videos put together.
[2:34:09.840 --> 2:34:10.840]  Grab those clips.
[2:34:10.840 --> 2:34:11.840]  Grab the timestamps.
[2:34:11.840 --> 2:34:15.840]  Write about your own movies, and let's make them available to Alex.
[2:34:15.840 --> 2:34:18.840]  Alex likes it. Maybe he'll steal your clip and record it for himself.
[2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:23.840]  Let's get this done by July 4th, and celebrate a new July 4th.
[2:34:23.840 --> 2:34:26.840]  So, you don't have time to do another movie.
[2:34:26.840 --> 2:34:29.840]  You're talking about the Alex Jones' right movie idea that Joe Rogan has
[2:34:29.840 --> 2:34:32.840]  that needs to be done, and really the most effective thing
[2:34:32.840 --> 2:34:35.840]  waking people up right now is Alex Jones' clips
[2:34:35.840 --> 2:34:38.840]  and other Patriot clips decades ago predicting all this.
[2:34:38.840 --> 2:34:41.840]  That on Instagram and Twitter in places is really having a big effect.
[2:34:41.840 --> 2:34:43.840]  There's so many predictions that came true.
[2:34:43.840 --> 2:34:46.840]  People can also re-put out the clips that have already been out there
[2:34:46.840 --> 2:34:47.840]  because they take them down.
[2:34:47.840 --> 2:34:49.840]  They get millions of views. They take them down.
[2:34:49.840 --> 2:34:51.840]  Just re-upload them again, and it's having a huge effect.
[2:34:51.840 --> 2:34:53.840]  Just let people know they're under attack.
[2:34:53.840 --> 2:34:55.840]  Let them understand the Globalist Program.
[2:34:55.840 --> 2:34:57.840]  I was going to hold the other guy over, the trucker,
[2:34:57.840 --> 2:35:01.840]  to kind of elaborate on his ideas, but if we had the bully pulpit
[2:35:01.840 --> 2:35:04.840]  and could actually reach people like a president could,
[2:35:04.840 --> 2:35:06.840]  or others, we could stop this.
[2:35:06.840 --> 2:35:08.840]  That's why I've really been pushing members of Congress
[2:35:08.840 --> 2:35:10.840]  that know what's going on to not eat around the edges,
[2:35:10.840 --> 2:35:14.840]  but strike right at the New World Order and expose it for what it is.
[2:35:14.840 --> 2:35:19.840]  A genocidal eugenics transhumanist death cult.
[2:35:21.840 --> 2:35:24.840]  So Patriots, get these, find those clips, record where they are,
[2:35:24.840 --> 2:35:27.840]  write it that up, make some videos, put them out there, let's go.
[2:35:27.840 --> 2:35:30.840]  Get them to Alex so we can start to take this thing over.
[2:35:30.840 --> 2:35:32.840]  Well, that's really, thank you, sir.
[2:35:32.840 --> 2:35:34.840]  That's really what's already happened.
[2:35:34.840 --> 2:35:36.840]  We didn't go out and dig up all these clips
[2:35:36.840 --> 2:35:39.840]  of where I predicted all the specifics of lockdowns and masks
[2:35:39.840 --> 2:35:43.840]  and rolling lockdowns and power outages and carbon lockdowns.
[2:35:43.840 --> 2:35:45.840]  I mean, people went and found all those,
[2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:47.840]  and they're finding more every day.
[2:35:47.840 --> 2:35:49.840]  I mean, I've got a couple on my list here today
[2:35:49.840 --> 2:35:51.840]  that I probably don't have time to get to.
[2:35:51.840 --> 2:35:54.840]  But that really is one of the most effective things we've got.
[2:35:54.840 --> 2:35:55.840]  And I always knew that.
[2:35:55.840 --> 2:35:59.840]  I knew that if we weren't able to fully stop them launching all this,
[2:35:59.840 --> 2:36:01.840]  when they were building it, preparing it in beta,
[2:36:01.840 --> 2:36:04.840]  that once they launched it, it would really wake people up
[2:36:04.840 --> 2:36:06.840]  that we were able to predict it with precision.
[2:36:06.840 --> 2:36:09.840]  That would show them that the rest of what we're now saying is going to happen,
[2:36:09.840 --> 2:36:11.840]  is going to happen if people don't take action.
[2:36:11.840 --> 2:36:14.840]  And I played that Debo's group member saying,
[2:36:14.840 --> 2:36:16.840]  we want to kill the majority of the public,
[2:36:16.840 --> 2:36:18.840]  and we're going to do it very slowly and very peacefully,
[2:36:18.840 --> 2:36:19.840]  cutting your resources off.
[2:36:19.840 --> 2:36:22.840]  I mean, these are real declarations of war against you
[2:36:22.840 --> 2:36:25.840]  and your family and myself as well.
[2:36:25.840 --> 2:36:26.840]  And I believe in you.
[2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:28.840]  I believe we're going to rally and stop this.
[2:36:28.840 --> 2:36:29.840]  It's starting to happen all over the world.
[2:36:29.840 --> 2:36:32.840]  Leaders are getting elected that are way more hardcore than Trump was,
[2:36:32.840 --> 2:36:35.840]  like Bolsonaro, like Orbán, and many others.
[2:36:35.840 --> 2:36:39.840]  All right, let's move to more calls here.
[2:36:39.840 --> 2:36:40.840]  Now, whether you trust him or not,
[2:36:40.840 --> 2:36:42.840]  Vladimir Putin's talking about all this stuff now.
[2:36:42.840 --> 2:36:45.840]  So, I mean, we're starting to turn the worm here.
[2:36:45.840 --> 2:36:48.840]  We're starting to really change things.
[2:36:48.840 --> 2:36:52.840]  Let's go ahead and go to Tito in California.
[2:36:52.840 --> 2:36:54.840]  Tito, welcome.
[2:36:54.840 --> 2:36:55.840]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[2:36:55.840 --> 2:36:56.840]  I'm a big fan.
[2:36:56.840 --> 2:36:58.840]  You woke me up about five years ago.
[2:36:58.840 --> 2:37:00.840]  I live in California and Sonoma County.
[2:37:00.840 --> 2:37:04.840]  And the reason why I'm calling is that because we need help out here in California,
[2:37:04.840 --> 2:37:05.840]  we need to get rid of Gavin Newsom.
[2:37:05.840 --> 2:37:07.840]  And this is Canada right now, Ronnie.
[2:37:07.840 --> 2:37:08.840]  I'm Anthony Termino.
[2:37:08.840 --> 2:37:11.840]  He's Cuban and Mexican, but was born in LA.
[2:37:11.840 --> 2:37:13.840]  So he's 100% American.
[2:37:13.840 --> 2:37:15.840]  And I think he'd be the, you know, the Sanchez of the West.
[2:37:15.840 --> 2:37:18.840]  Well, I mean, we know the Newsom lost the election.
[2:37:18.840 --> 2:37:20.840]  We know blue states are engaged in election fraud.
[2:37:20.840 --> 2:37:22.840]  We know they're shipping in fentanyl.
[2:37:22.840 --> 2:37:24.840]  And so your big problem is election fraud.
[2:37:24.840 --> 2:37:27.840]  They caught all those trucks full of ballots for Newsom
[2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:31.840]  that were just made up with dummy, you know, list of names of dead people
[2:37:31.840 --> 2:37:33.840]  or folks that moved out of the state.
[2:37:33.840 --> 2:37:36.840]  And the problem is people leave California to get away from it,
[2:37:36.840 --> 2:37:38.840]  but then they're still there voting for years after they leave.
[2:37:38.840 --> 2:37:42.840]  So your biggest issue is election fraud, but everybody should still run
[2:37:42.840 --> 2:37:45.840]  because that's how you expose the fraud and it's how you get in the elections
[2:37:45.840 --> 2:37:48.840]  and it's how you use the election process to educate people.
[2:37:48.840 --> 2:37:52.840]  So I believe California and other states, I don't believe I know,
[2:37:52.840 --> 2:37:53.840]  are under election fraud bondage.
[2:37:53.840 --> 2:37:57.840]  That's why the Justice Department that's captured and controlled by the New World Order
[2:37:57.840 --> 2:38:03.840]  doesn't want people to talk about it because it's the Achilles heel
[2:38:03.840 --> 2:38:05.840]  or the chink in their armor.
[2:38:05.840 --> 2:38:06.840]  Yeah, definitely.
[2:38:06.840 --> 2:38:10.840]  I just think I think California will be a big impact to the country
[2:38:10.840 --> 2:38:13.840]  just because it's a beautiful state with wonderful people
[2:38:13.840 --> 2:38:16.840]  and it's a shame it's a globalist hellhole now.
[2:38:16.840 --> 2:38:18.840]  Yes, I definitely agree.
[2:38:18.840 --> 2:38:22.840]  We just need help out here from, you know, here are big, big people like you, Alex.
[2:38:22.840 --> 2:38:24.840]  I appreciate everything you do for us.
[2:38:24.840 --> 2:38:26.840]  Brother, what else is on your mind, Tito?
[2:38:26.840 --> 2:38:27.840]  No, nothing.
[2:38:27.840 --> 2:38:31.840]  It's just that I just think a lot of the rest of the country should get behind
[2:38:31.840 --> 2:38:34.840]  what's going on in California because we need help, you know, getting these candidates out there.
[2:38:34.840 --> 2:38:35.840]  No, you're right.
[2:38:35.840 --> 2:38:37.840]  A lot of people say build a wall, let it succeed.
[2:38:37.840 --> 2:38:38.840]  I've made jokes and said that.
[2:38:38.840 --> 2:38:40.840]  But no, if they go down, we all go down.
[2:38:40.840 --> 2:38:44.840]  We've got to stand with New York and California and other globalist occupied areas.
[2:38:44.840 --> 2:38:45.840]  Beautiful point, Tito.
[2:38:45.840 --> 2:38:47.840]  Thank you so much.
[2:38:47.840 --> 2:38:52.840]  All right, let's go ahead now and talk to Jimmy in Utah.
[2:38:52.840 --> 2:38:54.840]  Jimmy, welcome.
[2:38:54.840 --> 2:38:56.840]  Hey, Alex.
[2:38:56.840 --> 2:38:57.840]  Welcome.
[2:38:57.840 --> 2:39:02.840]  Hey, man, I just want to say you're like a, you're a rock star, Alex, and I was up to you.
[2:39:02.840 --> 2:39:08.840]  I've been listening to you since like 2008 and I've got the shirts.
[2:39:08.840 --> 2:39:11.840]  I've got all the supplements, man.
[2:39:11.840 --> 2:39:14.840]  I've got the three of the gold bars, the two.
[2:39:14.840 --> 2:39:15.840]  I've got the second one.
[2:39:15.840 --> 2:39:18.840]  Well, your success is our success and our success is your success.
[2:39:18.840 --> 2:39:20.840]  You're the reason we're still here.
[2:39:20.840 --> 2:39:25.840]  I want to thank you, Jimmy, for your support because there's all these new people constantly tuning in
[2:39:25.840 --> 2:39:27.840]  and they wouldn't be able to hear all this if it wasn't for you.
[2:39:27.840 --> 2:39:30.840]  So for myself and my family and the whole crew, thank you, brother.
[2:39:30.840 --> 2:39:32.840]  What's on your mind?
[2:39:32.840 --> 2:39:38.840]  Well, I was, I was wondering to ask you if you knew anything about, uh, I'm sure you know about the movie 2000 mules,
[2:39:38.840 --> 2:39:45.840]  but I heard that, um, Tucker had the lady Catherine Englebright on there from to the vote.
[2:39:45.840 --> 2:39:53.840]  And he specifically told her not to mention that movie and I was wondering why he would do that because it's such a
[2:39:53.840 --> 2:39:56.840]  eye-opening movie that everybody needs to see.
[2:39:56.840 --> 2:39:57.840]  Well, here's the deal.
[2:39:57.840 --> 2:40:04.840]  I meant today to do a whole review of the movie and we have a bunch of clips and I will start the show tomorrow.
[2:40:04.840 --> 2:40:09.840]  I'll do two segments of news tomorrow and then I will get to all these clips that I dropped the ball and did not cover.
[2:40:09.840 --> 2:40:16.840]  That Rob do last night after we watched it stayed late and got these clips and I apologize to Rob too for not doing this.
[2:40:16.840 --> 2:40:21.840]  But we have 10 clips and I'm going to review the movie tomorrow and I'm going to talk about it.
[2:40:21.840 --> 2:40:25.840]  I know the inside baseball with Tucker and I'm going to leave it at that.
[2:40:25.840 --> 2:40:29.840]  He is literally, I'm not going to give away all the inside stuff.
[2:40:29.840 --> 2:40:30.840]  Let's just say this.
[2:40:30.840 --> 2:40:38.840]  Tucker did a contract to be paid a fraction of what he has paid just to have the freedom he has,
[2:40:38.840 --> 2:40:42.840]  but they have certain vetoes where they come in and he didn't tell me this,
[2:40:42.840 --> 2:40:53.840]  but I know this was happening at Fox and they said no 2000 mules because then the Democrats will drop all those election lawsuits they have on them if that happens.
[2:40:53.840 --> 2:40:55.840]  And so that's what that's about.
[2:40:55.840 --> 2:40:58.840]  Soros comes after Fox anytime they talk about him as well.
[2:40:58.840 --> 2:41:01.840]  And so Tucker is picking his battles.
[2:41:01.840 --> 2:41:03.840]  I have got Dinesh to Susan on next week.
[2:41:03.840 --> 2:41:06.840]  I've been trying to get all the other people that are involved on there.
[2:41:06.840 --> 2:41:08.840]  They kind of self-censored themselves.
[2:41:08.840 --> 2:41:09.840]  They're scared of info wars.
[2:41:09.840 --> 2:41:11.840]  People need to stop doing that.
[2:41:11.840 --> 2:41:14.840]  But we're going to do a big push tomorrow for 2000 mules.
[2:41:14.840 --> 2:41:16.840]  Tell folks they can go watch it.
[2:41:16.840 --> 2:41:19.840]  And we commend the Salem Network and others to help produce it.
[2:41:19.840 --> 2:41:22.840]  And it is a groundbreaking, most important film in decades.
[2:41:22.840 --> 2:41:24.840]  Totally proves the election fraud and how they did it.
[2:41:24.840 --> 2:41:28.840]  Not electronic like the Q people said, like I warned Lindell,
[2:41:28.840 --> 2:41:32.840]  but totally by mules bringing in the harvested ballots they had.
[2:41:32.840 --> 2:41:36.840]  That was the admitted plan to stop the red wave that they call the red mirage.
[2:41:36.840 --> 2:41:40.840]  And so we will be covering 2000 mules tomorrow in great detail.
[2:41:40.840 --> 2:41:43.840]  Great. Alex, can I say one more thing?
[2:41:43.840 --> 2:41:44.840]  Of course.
[2:41:44.840 --> 2:41:45.840]  All right.
[2:41:45.840 --> 2:41:47.840]  I have a probation officer right.
[2:41:47.840 --> 2:41:50.840]  And I was wearing your, I was wearing let's go bro.
[2:41:50.840 --> 2:41:55.840]  The other day when I went in and seen him and he was and the info wars hat.
[2:41:55.840 --> 2:42:00.840]  And I when I left, it was like, dude, how do you even watch Alex anymore?
[2:42:00.840 --> 2:42:05.840]  It says, since you got deep platform, I used to think he was kind of out there,
[2:42:05.840 --> 2:42:07.840]  but ever since they deep platformed him,
[2:42:07.840 --> 2:42:10.840]  I knew that he must have been right about some things.
[2:42:10.840 --> 2:42:14.840]  And he asked me where to watch you at and I told him band.videoinfowars.com.
[2:42:14.840 --> 2:42:18.840]  And he, you know, I thought that was cool because he was my probation officer.
[2:42:18.840 --> 2:42:20.840]  I was like, you know,
[2:42:20.840 --> 2:42:23.840]  what you did is the most important thing anybody can do there.
[2:42:23.840 --> 2:42:26.840]  We have all these giant listenerships out there that don't even know we're still
[2:42:26.840 --> 2:42:29.840]  on the air and everybody just says Alex Jones is still on the air at man dot video

[2:47:32.840 --> 2:47:40.840]  We are the American resistance.
[2:47:40.840 --> 2:47:42.840]  We are the human resistance.
[2:47:42.840 --> 2:47:44.840]  We're at world government.
[2:47:44.840 --> 2:47:49.840]  It's here tyrannical government with a aim to make us poor and controllable, dumb down
[2:47:49.840 --> 2:47:50.840]  and then exterminate.
[2:47:50.840 --> 2:47:52.840]  That's really the reality.
[2:47:52.840 --> 2:47:55.840]  That's not a negative to face the facts.
[2:47:55.840 --> 2:48:00.840]  It's a positive to admit that that negative is there and we're going to deal with it.
[2:48:00.840 --> 2:48:03.840]  And that's why this broadcast is so important.
[2:48:03.840 --> 2:48:05.840]  I'm going to go back to your phone calls.

[2:49:43.840 --> 2:49:46.840]  and let's go in the order the calls are received and finish up with the callers.
[2:49:46.840 --> 2:49:51.840]  We're ahead of Wayne Allen Root taking over in the war room in about 70 minutes from now.
[2:49:51.840 --> 2:49:53.840]  Let's talk to Jonathan in Arizona.
[2:49:53.840 --> 2:49:55.840]  Jonathan, welcome, sir.
[2:49:55.840 --> 2:49:57.840]  Hello, sir. How are you doing?
[2:49:57.840 --> 2:50:01.840]  Man, I am just really blessed and pleased to still be on air to spot all the attacks.
[2:50:01.840 --> 2:50:04.840]  That's only because of your support, sir.
[2:50:04.840 --> 2:50:07.840]  Well, thank you for everything you do. I appreciate it.
[2:50:07.840 --> 2:50:11.840]  I just want to share with you an idea for hopefully a way to save our country
[2:50:11.840 --> 2:50:18.840]  and make a big impact without any type of violence and hopefully a way to generate revenue for info wars.
[2:50:18.840 --> 2:50:24.840]  And I was thinking that if we all unite and go tax exempt, you know,
[2:50:24.840 --> 2:50:32.840]  because employers can't stop you from going exempt, just go exempt on the federal portion of it
[2:50:32.840 --> 2:50:34.840]  and then keep giving to the state.
[2:50:34.840 --> 2:50:38.840]  Well, I'm not going to give out tax advice because a lot of it's unconstitutional
[2:50:38.840 --> 2:50:43.840]  and you'll still break your legs basically. But that's why we have jonestaxrelief.com
[2:50:43.840 --> 2:50:48.840]  that takes you to American Tax Solutions, who's one of the best cut to the chase law firms
[2:50:48.840 --> 2:50:50.840]  that just makes the percentage of the money you save.
[2:50:50.840 --> 2:50:53.840]  They then look at your returns, look at your business, look at your job,
[2:50:53.840 --> 2:50:57.840]  whether you're a factory worker or a doctor or a billionaire.
[2:50:57.840 --> 2:51:00.840]  Most people are not using the loopholes that are there.
[2:51:00.840 --> 2:51:03.840]  The globalists have those there because they basically don't pay taxes.
[2:51:03.840 --> 2:51:06.840]  Well, why should the general public be paying way more than they should?
[2:51:06.840 --> 2:51:08.840]  That's what everybody should go to.
[2:51:08.840 --> 2:51:11.840]  And it's a great sponsor, by the way, and it's invaluable for everybody.
[2:51:11.840 --> 2:51:13.840]  jonestaxrelief.com
[2:51:13.840 --> 2:51:19.840]  Well, that's the, you know, my plan is to still have them go to jonestax.
[2:51:19.840 --> 2:51:21.840]  You got to just sponsor.
[2:51:21.840 --> 2:51:25.840]  But, you know, because at the end of the year, they could set you up on a payment plan
[2:51:25.840 --> 2:51:30.840]  or even settle an amount that'll still most likely be less than what you would have paid throughout the year.
[2:51:30.840 --> 2:51:35.840]  But it'll make an impact in the sense that they're not getting all that money throughout the year.
[2:51:35.840 --> 2:51:38.840]  And then each year, you still file.
[2:51:38.840 --> 2:51:40.840]  Well, that's it.
[2:51:40.840 --> 2:51:44.840]  But, I mean, again, there's more than 20 services they've got.
[2:51:44.840 --> 2:51:48.840]  And what I like is they're not like all these other law firms that make you pay a bunch of money up front
[2:51:48.840 --> 2:51:49.840]  and then make you wait.
[2:51:49.840 --> 2:51:52.840]  And then those places are just ripping you off.
[2:51:52.840 --> 2:51:54.840]  They cut right to the chase.
[2:51:54.840 --> 2:52:00.840]  And it doesn't matter whether you back tax debts, it doesn't matter what it is.
[2:52:00.840 --> 2:52:07.840]  They can assess very quickly and in almost every case, save you a ton of money right up front.
[2:52:07.840 --> 2:52:16.840]  Yeah, I mean, I guess just at the end of the day, my thinking is that obviously because the Congress, you know, the income tax was passed illegally.
[2:52:16.840 --> 2:52:25.840]  Initially in Congress, they have a vested interest both in their salary and also the way they siphon money off of all these out of country projects.
[2:52:25.840 --> 2:52:27.840]  So they're not going to do anything for it.
[2:52:27.840 --> 2:52:32.840]  Well, the tax code is written to rip off the middle class, make people poor.
[2:52:32.840 --> 2:52:33.840]  It's for social engineering.
[2:52:33.840 --> 2:52:35.840]  That is admitted.
[2:52:35.840 --> 2:52:39.840]  And anyone that doesn't take advantage of the loopholes is insane.
[2:52:39.840 --> 2:52:40.840]  God bless you, sir.
[2:52:40.840 --> 2:52:41.840]  I appreciate your call, Jonathan.
[2:52:41.840 --> 2:52:43.840]  Let's talk to Todd in Ohio.
[2:52:43.840 --> 2:52:44.840]  Todd, welcome.
[2:52:44.840 --> 2:52:46.840]  Yes, first time caller.
[2:52:46.840 --> 2:52:50.840]  Thank you for saving me from the shot and informing me on the treatment.
[2:52:50.840 --> 2:52:53.840]  I survived the COVID with very little effect.
[2:52:53.840 --> 2:52:54.840]  Wonderful.
[2:52:54.840 --> 2:52:55.840]  Because of that.
[2:52:55.840 --> 2:53:01.840]  Have your people look up, Zimmer, a power plant shut down in Cincinnati.
[2:53:01.840 --> 2:53:07.840]  This month they're shutting down a 1.2 billion watt capacity coal-fired power plant.
[2:53:07.840 --> 2:53:13.840]  And they're getting ready to shut down another similar plant in a couple of years.
[2:53:13.840 --> 2:53:16.840]  And they're telling you suddenly rolling blockouts and on the power.
[2:53:16.840 --> 2:53:20.840]  I bought a suitcase generator to power my refrigerator.
[2:53:20.840 --> 2:53:25.840]  But that's the third thing I want to say, I thought two other things while I was waiting.
[2:53:25.840 --> 2:53:32.840]  One, I'm not a person who's a confident speaker, but I've spoken in front of my village council,
[2:53:32.840 --> 2:53:37.840]  a couple of neighboring city councils, the Cincinnati City Council, county commissioners.
[2:53:37.840 --> 2:53:44.840]  How I did it was you go to your local council and see if there's somebody speaking on a subject
[2:53:44.840 --> 2:53:47.840]  that you can support, get to talking to them.
[2:53:47.840 --> 2:53:53.840]  And then you can go around with them and support what they're saying, like me too.
[2:53:53.840 --> 2:53:58.840]  But you don't have to write the whole big, powerful speech.
[2:53:58.840 --> 2:54:00.840]  You can be there in support.
[2:54:00.840 --> 2:54:03.840]  And just hold the signer first.
[2:54:03.840 --> 2:54:07.840]  One of the best ways to have your voice heard is to go to city council or county commissioners
[2:54:07.840 --> 2:54:09.840]  or school board and speak.
[2:54:09.840 --> 2:54:13.840]  You'll notice they call the FBI on people that peacefully went and said they didn't want critical race theory
[2:54:13.840 --> 2:54:16.840]  or transgenderism taught to five-year-olds in places like Virginia.
[2:54:16.840 --> 2:54:18.840]  But they won't send the FBI.
[2:54:18.840 --> 2:54:21.840]  People are screaming and yelling illegally at the houses of federal judges.
[2:54:21.840 --> 2:54:23.840]  It is insane.
[2:54:23.840 --> 2:54:31.840]  Yes. And the other thing I wanted to mention is that in Norway, they've shut down all the FM radio stations
[2:54:31.840 --> 2:54:35.840]  and they're going to shut down stations by 2025 in Switzerland.
[2:54:35.840 --> 2:54:39.840]  I know there's a globalist move to get us away from TV and radio that doesn't watch you.
[2:54:39.840 --> 2:54:45.840]  UHF, VHF, AM, shortwave, FM, they want to get rid of all of it and make everything be digital.
[2:54:45.840 --> 2:54:47.840]  So they can turn it all off when they want to.
[2:54:47.840 --> 2:54:52.840]  Just like now, we don't have enough formula because women stop, you know, using their breast.
[2:54:52.840 --> 2:54:55.840]  And knocking women that have to work and do the formula.
[2:54:55.840 --> 2:55:01.840]  The point is, is that this is part of them making humanity artificial and totally under their control.
[2:55:01.840 --> 2:55:07.840]  Sheeps, shortwave radios, you can buy as presents for people and give them a frequency list to tune in
[2:55:07.840 --> 2:55:10.840]  and they can listen to you, wherever they are.
[2:55:10.840 --> 2:55:14.840]  And also, there are several other truth-based broadcasters on shortwave.
[2:55:14.840 --> 2:55:19.840]  That's right. We're on WWCR, like, six hours a day, three hours during the day, three hours at night.
[2:55:19.840 --> 2:55:23.840]  And anybody can go there and find the frequencies because they change here and there.
[2:55:23.840 --> 2:55:27.840]  On 100,000 watt shortwaves, we pay $11,000 a month to be on as a world service.
[2:55:27.840 --> 2:55:30.840]  That's where a lot of the money coming in goes. It's things like that, folks. We don't mention.
[2:55:30.840 --> 2:55:32.840]  Thank you, Todd.
[2:55:32.840 --> 2:55:36.840]  Curly in the great state of Texas. Curly, welcome.
[2:55:36.840 --> 2:55:39.840]  Good afternoon, Alex. How are you doing, sir?
[2:55:39.840 --> 2:55:42.840]  Good. You're our tail gunner today. The last caller before Wayne Ellyn Root takes over.
[2:55:42.840 --> 2:55:50.840]  Excellent. Okay. First off, been listening to you since the final edition on B-93-3.
[2:55:50.840 --> 2:55:54.840]  That's right. So you've been listening a long time.
[2:55:54.840 --> 2:55:59.840]  Yes, sir. Whether permitting, actually, but anyhow.
[2:55:59.840 --> 2:56:07.840]  So the question I'm kind of curious about, if the vaccinations are genetically modified, which they are,
[2:56:07.840 --> 2:56:14.840]  when an individual winds up with an injection or multiple injections,
[2:56:14.840 --> 2:56:20.840]  do they not become the property of the vaccination company that manufactures those things?
[2:56:20.840 --> 2:56:23.840]  That's what they're technically arguing if you're now a mutant.
[2:56:23.840 --> 2:56:27.840]  Now they're passing laws around the world that you, quote, can't discriminate against mutants.
[2:56:27.840 --> 2:56:31.840]  So they're getting us ready for clones, human animal hybrids.
[2:56:31.840 --> 2:56:36.840]  All this is already going on. And now they're just normalizing this whole artificial world they're rolling out.
[2:56:36.840 --> 2:56:39.840]  Where normal human life is not sustainable.
[2:56:39.840 --> 2:56:42.840]  Yes, sir. Absolutely. Well, blessings to you.
[2:56:42.840 --> 2:56:47.840]  This is the first time I've been able to call and speak with you through these many years,
[2:56:47.840 --> 2:56:52.840]  but it's been a pleasure. And if you get over here about 100 miles west of you at some point,
[2:56:52.840 --> 2:56:54.840]  I'd love to shake your hand.
[2:56:54.840 --> 2:56:57.840]  Love to shake your hand, Curly. Let me ask you this.
[2:56:57.840 --> 2:57:02.840]  So have you been listening since I did the final edition? That's like 98, 99?
[2:57:02.840 --> 2:57:07.840]  Now, sir, that was actually 94, I believe.
[2:57:07.840 --> 2:57:11.840]  Well, I wasn't on air until about 95, but you've definitely been listening.
[2:57:11.840 --> 2:57:14.840]  You've been listening a long time, brother.
[2:57:14.840 --> 2:57:22.840]  Yes, there would have been 95 then because I made a career change and it was just prior to my career change
[2:57:22.840 --> 2:57:27.840]  that I started listening to you over here about 100 miles west of you.
[2:57:27.840 --> 2:57:32.840]  But 93 would come in when the weather conditions was just right.
[2:57:32.840 --> 2:57:35.840]  That's right. So, Curly, we love you and thank you so much.
[2:57:35.840 --> 2:57:39.840]  I'm going to do five more minutes on the abortion issue and how it ties into January 6th
[2:57:39.840 --> 2:57:45.840]  and how the globals are playing a strike that Wayne Allen Root takes over.
[2:57:45.840 --> 2:57:53.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, Mike Lindell is sponsoring thousands of leading pro-America patriots
[2:57:53.840 --> 2:57:57.840]  across the United States. He's the main sponsor keeping so many people on the air.
[2:57:57.840 --> 2:58:00.840]  He's a huge sponsor at M4. That's why we're so pleased to work with him.
[2:58:00.840 --> 2:58:05.840]  He's offering the biggest sale he's done in years, his Bogo sale.

[2:58:32.840 --> 2:58:34.840]  It's only running for one week.
[2:58:34.840 --> 2:58:40.840]  Mypillow.com forward slash Alex or 800-675-4614.
[2:58:40.840 --> 2:58:51.840]  And thank you for shopping America and keeping us on the air.
[2:59:11.840 --> 2:59:15.840]  Whether it's a thousand dollars or a million dollars, we will use it to fight the new world order.
[2:59:15.840 --> 2:59:20.840]  Ethereum, Bitcoin, XRP, Litecoin, there's dozens of them there.
[2:59:20.840 --> 2:59:22.840]  Infowarsstore.com.
[2:59:22.840 --> 2:59:25.840]  And by the way, we've got our own NFTs that aren't a scam.
[2:59:25.840 --> 2:59:28.840]  They're totally badass in total victory coming out next week.
[2:59:28.840 --> 2:59:30.840]  I'll tell you about that later.
[2:59:30.840 --> 2:59:35.840]  But right now, infowars.com forward slash crypto, the real revolution is happening now.
[2:59:35.840 --> 2:59:40.840]  Infowars.com forward slash crypto and all of the donated, we salute you and thank you.
[3:00:05.840 --> 3:00:09.840]  Now it won't be televised.
[3:00:09.840 --> 3:00:14.840]  We're welcome to the revolution.
[3:00:14.840 --> 3:00:18.840]  We won't fight.
[3:00:18.840 --> 3:00:23.840]  When the institutions take illusion.
[3:00:23.840 --> 3:00:26.840]  Great Jimmy Levy bringing us in.
[3:00:26.840 --> 3:00:27.840]  The way down the road takes over.
[3:00:27.840 --> 3:00:29.840]  A team out of six minutes.
[3:00:29.840 --> 3:00:32.840]  Now let me hit the support area.
[3:00:32.840 --> 3:00:40.840]  Thousands of articles a day demonizing American people saying anybody that's supporters or doesn't want to take four shots or questions, elections as a terrorist.
[3:00:40.840 --> 3:00:43.840]  And just absolute hyping of this everywhere.
[3:00:43.840 --> 3:00:45.840]  And now we've got this out of the gate London.
[3:00:45.840 --> 3:00:46.840]  Pure evil.
[3:00:46.840 --> 3:00:54.840]  Biden's DOJ is threatening January 6th defendants with life in prison after walking inside US Capitol taking pictures.
[3:00:54.840 --> 3:01:01.840]  And the whole article lays out how they're now openly telling defendants that they might just charge them basically with terrorism with sedition.
[3:01:01.840 --> 3:01:05.840]  And try to keep them in jail for the rest of their lives.
[3:01:05.840 --> 3:01:06.840]  Evil is walking the halls.
[3:01:06.840 --> 3:01:10.840]  The government and weak men and women are too afraid to speak out.
[3:01:10.840 --> 3:01:17.840]  And the whole article lays this important information on what seditious conspiracy means.
[3:01:17.840 --> 3:01:23.840]  Meanwhile, actual insurrection Chicago mayor calls to arms close quote over Supreme Court.
[3:01:23.840 --> 3:01:34.840]  Mayor Lightfoot has issued a call to arms in response to leak ruling from the Supreme Court, which will return Roe v. Wade implying that the USSC should come for the LBGTQ rights next.
[3:01:34.840 --> 3:01:39.840]  My friend, she goes on, the Supreme Court is coming for us next.
[3:01:39.840 --> 3:01:41.840]  The moment has to be to call to arms.
[3:01:41.840 --> 3:01:43.840]  She wrote in the tweet.
[3:01:43.840 --> 3:01:45.840]  And again, that's a figure of space.
[3:01:45.840 --> 3:01:47.840]  But if I said that, that arrest me.
[3:01:47.840 --> 3:01:52.840]  McConnell says national abortion ban possible.
[3:01:52.840 --> 3:01:56.840]  In a statement.
[3:01:56.840 --> 3:02:01.840]  We now have leftist activists threatening Supreme Court justices and attacking Christianity.
[3:02:01.840 --> 3:02:05.840]  You know all about this, but it's just getting out of control.
[3:02:05.840 --> 3:02:10.840]  Satanic temple will argue abortion is religious ritual in legal challenge.
[3:02:10.840 --> 3:02:13.840]  We live in a society says the meme.
[3:02:13.840 --> 3:02:16.840]  We're homosexuals lecture us on morals.
[3:02:16.840 --> 3:02:19.840]  Transvestites lecture us on human biology.
[3:02:19.840 --> 3:02:25.840]  Baby killers lecture us on human rights and socialist lecture us on economics.
[3:02:25.840 --> 3:02:32.840]  And remember when Chuck Schumer said that they would come at the Supreme Court justices that they had reaped the whirlwind and they better watch it.
[3:02:32.840 --> 3:02:35.840]  Now that's protected speech, but it's right on the edge.
[3:02:35.840 --> 3:02:43.840]  But it's nothing compared to what they're planning in the future.
[3:02:43.840 --> 3:02:44.840]  Look at this meme.
[3:02:44.840 --> 3:02:45.840]  First wave feminism.
[3:02:45.840 --> 3:02:47.840]  We want to be equal to men.
[3:02:47.840 --> 3:02:49.840]  Second wave feminism.
[3:02:49.840 --> 3:02:50.840]  We don't need men.
[3:02:50.840 --> 3:02:51.840]  Third wave feminism.
[3:02:51.840 --> 3:02:53.840]  We are men.
[3:02:53.840 --> 3:02:56.840]  Certainly says it all.
[3:02:56.840 --> 3:02:58.840]  Meanwhile, I see these stories everywhere.
[3:02:58.840 --> 3:03:02.840]  Feminist baked sourdough bread using her own vaginal yeast.
[3:03:02.840 --> 3:03:03.840]  All of it gross.
[3:03:03.840 --> 3:03:05.840]  All of it degrading women.
[3:03:05.840 --> 3:03:11.840]  It just goes on and on and on from there.
[3:03:11.840 --> 3:03:18.840]  I don't have time to get to this video of Trudeau where he couldn't even run a flag up a flagpole.
[3:03:18.840 --> 3:03:20.840]  These people are paper tigers.
[3:03:20.840 --> 3:03:28.840]  And we've got to start calling them on it and stop letting them order us around and thinking for ourselves is the only way out of this.
[3:03:28.840 --> 3:03:29.840]  All right.
[3:03:29.840 --> 3:03:33.840]  They're planning big stuff in the next 182 days out of the midterms.
[3:03:33.840 --> 3:03:39.840]  They've said the number one terror threat is Christian conservatives and evil white people and people that question election fraud.
[3:03:39.840 --> 3:03:43.840]  Tomorrow we'll be covering clips and analysis out of 2,000 mules.
[3:03:43.840 --> 3:03:45.840]  I meant to get to it today, but it had so much going on.
[3:03:45.840 --> 3:03:47.840]  We'll start the show with that tomorrow, I promise.
[3:03:47.840 --> 3:03:49.840]  And really give it a big push and analysis.
[3:03:49.840 --> 3:03:52.840]  The Dinesh and Susan and others are scheduled to be on the show next week.
[3:03:52.840 --> 3:03:55.840]  But that is such an important film as well.
[3:03:55.840 --> 3:04:07.840]  But just remember that all of this flows out of globalism and the corrupt corporations that are anti-free market and want to make us poor so they can dictate the terms of our surrender.
[3:04:07.840 --> 3:04:19.840]  That's why being successful, being positive, being vibrant, being leaders, not taking it lying down, but taking it as a challenge of like climbing a mountain will make us stronger in the end because they can break our will.
[3:04:19.840 --> 3:04:21.840]  So pray to God to strengthen your will and discernment.
[3:04:21.840 --> 3:04:23.840]  And pray to God to rise you up as a leader.
[3:04:23.840 --> 3:04:25.840]  Not just help yourself, but help others.
[3:04:25.840 --> 3:04:27.840]  And thank you all for your support and what you do.
[3:04:27.840 --> 3:04:33.840]  Now everybody, have you told your friends and family or neighbors or strangers about M4Wars.com today?
[3:04:33.840 --> 3:04:35.840]  Have you told them about the war at 3 p.m.?
[3:04:35.840 --> 3:04:44.840]  Tell them that Wayne Allen Root, who is a fireball of knowledge, best-selling author, talk show host, researcher, is about to take over on the other side, so strap yourselves in.
[3:04:44.840 --> 3:05:10.840]  And then, in 55 minutes, the great Owen Schreuer with the War Room, M4Wars.com, forward slash show.
[3:05:10.840 --> 3:05:15.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is something that is essential and everyone should get.
[3:05:15.840 --> 3:05:19.840]  And on top of it, it funds the M4Wars, so that's the 360 win.
[3:05:19.840 --> 3:05:21.840]  Let me tell you what is in this amazing product.
[3:05:21.840 --> 3:05:30.840]  Concentrated elderberry, concentrated echinacea, concentrated astragalus root, angelica root, loatium root, and more.
[3:05:30.840 --> 3:05:32.840]  This product is incredible.
[3:05:32.840 --> 3:05:40.840]  M4Wars immune support, exclusively available at M4WarsStore.com, is funding the tip of the spear, the M4Wars operation.
[3:05:40.840 --> 3:05:41.840]  It is a 360 win.
[3:05:41.840 --> 3:05:48.840]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's natural defenses and keep M4Wars on the air.
[3:05:48.840 --> 3:05:51.840]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[3:05:51.840 --> 3:05:53.840]  Take action now, M4WarsStore.com.
[3:05:53.840 --> 3:05:58.840]  All right, Wayne Allen Roots with you for this hour.
[3:05:58.840 --> 3:06:00.840]  Alex Jones, thank you for having me on.
[3:06:00.840 --> 3:06:02.840]  I see my tie is a little bit off.
[3:06:02.840 --> 3:06:03.840]  We'll work on that.
[3:06:03.840 --> 3:06:04.840]  We'll work on that.
[3:06:04.840 --> 3:06:08.840]  In any case, let me tell you what I've gotten in store for you today.
[3:06:08.840 --> 3:06:09.840]  Lots of things.
[3:06:09.840 --> 3:06:13.840]  Let me start with a little personal gratification.
[3:06:13.840 --> 3:06:18.840]  I feel great that I wrote a book called The Great Patriot Protest and the Patriot War Room.
[3:06:18.840 --> 3:06:23.840]  And it was a number one bestseller in, I don't know, about 20 categories at Amazon.
[3:06:23.840 --> 3:06:28.840]  It's been on and off a top bestseller for the last six months since it came out.
[3:06:28.840 --> 3:06:29.840]  It was number one.
[3:06:29.840 --> 3:06:34.840]  And the point of the book is to go after the woke corporations.
[3:06:34.840 --> 3:06:43.840]  And I listed 116 companies that I did thousands of hours of research and found the 160 companies that I listed.
[3:06:43.840 --> 3:06:52.840]  I did thousands of hours of research and found the 116 most woke companies that accept our money,
[3:06:52.840 --> 3:06:55.840]  get rich our money and treat us like garbage.
[3:06:55.840 --> 3:07:01.840]  Conservatives, Christians, deplorables, patriots, they take our money and they treat us like garbage.
[3:07:01.840 --> 3:07:05.840]  And I went out with those thousands of hours of research and hired a team.
[3:07:05.840 --> 3:07:15.840]  And that team found the phone numbers, the email addresses, the social media addresses, the physical address of each one of these companies,
[3:07:15.840 --> 3:07:17.840]  their CEOs and their board of directors.
[3:07:17.840 --> 3:07:19.840]  And I listed it in this book.
[3:07:19.840 --> 3:07:22.840]  And so it came out, I don't know, about eight months ago.
[3:07:22.840 --> 3:07:24.840]  I must have written it about a year ago.
[3:07:24.840 --> 3:07:26.840]  Who's on that list right at the top?
[3:07:26.840 --> 3:07:27.840]  Disney.
[3:07:27.840 --> 3:07:28.840]  How did I know?
[3:07:28.840 --> 3:07:30.840]  I just knew thousands of hours of research.
[3:07:30.840 --> 3:07:31.840]  Who's near the top?
[3:07:31.840 --> 3:07:32.840]  Netflix.
[3:07:32.840 --> 3:07:33.840]  Who's near the top?
[3:07:33.840 --> 3:07:34.840]  Target.
[3:07:34.840 --> 3:07:37.840]  So let me start with what happened after the book came out.
[3:07:37.840 --> 3:07:40.840]  The great patriot protest of Boycott Book comes out.
[3:07:40.840 --> 3:07:46.840]  And over the last few months, Disney has lost over $60 billion in market share.
[3:07:46.840 --> 3:07:51.840]  Netflix has lost over $50 billion in market share.
[3:07:51.840 --> 3:07:54.840]  And now who wants more of the pain?
[3:07:54.840 --> 3:07:58.840]  Who is into SNM and wants more of the pain?
[3:07:58.840 --> 3:07:59.840]  Target.
[3:07:59.840 --> 3:08:02.840]  Target the clothing store.
[3:08:02.840 --> 3:08:05.840]  The department store that sells more than just clothing,
[3:08:05.840 --> 3:08:08.840]  but they sell all kinds of junk, low end junk.
[3:08:08.840 --> 3:08:15.840]  And Target is now proud to announce their collaboration with a queer company.
[3:08:15.840 --> 3:08:17.840]  Now they're the ones who use that word, not me.
[3:08:17.840 --> 3:08:19.840]  To me, queer is a terrible word.
[3:08:19.840 --> 3:08:21.840]  I would never use that word.
[3:08:21.840 --> 3:08:23.840]  To me, queer is a bad word.
[3:08:23.840 --> 3:08:26.840]  You know, it's like when you use a bad word for African Americans,
[3:08:26.840 --> 3:08:29.840]  you use that N word, your life's over, your career's over.
[3:08:29.840 --> 3:08:33.840]  To me, queer is a terrible, poise this word.
[3:08:33.840 --> 3:08:35.840]  Gays love it now.
[3:08:35.840 --> 3:08:38.840]  Everything's about, you know, I'm queer, she's queer, it's queer.
[3:08:38.840 --> 3:08:40.840]  We're a queer company.
[3:08:40.840 --> 3:08:42.840]  We stand behind queers.
[3:08:42.840 --> 3:08:45.840]  So they're the ones who like the word, not me.
[3:08:45.840 --> 3:08:51.840]  And so the announcement is that Target is in bed with a queer company that features,
[3:08:51.840 --> 3:08:53.840]  and I don't care if you're gay.
[3:08:53.840 --> 3:08:55.840]  I've never cared if someone's gay.
[3:08:55.840 --> 3:08:57.840]  I come from New York City.
[3:08:57.840 --> 3:09:00.840]  I come from Hollywood where I was a big game show host,
[3:09:00.840 --> 3:09:03.840]  and a talk show host, and an anchor man,
[3:09:03.840 --> 3:09:05.840]  and it doesn't bother me if you're gay.
[3:09:05.840 --> 3:09:09.840]  What bothers me is the transgender brainwashing
[3:09:09.840 --> 3:09:12.840]  and trying to convince kids in kindergarten
[3:09:12.840 --> 3:09:16.840]  that they should switch their sex and turning on the TV set.
[3:09:16.840 --> 3:09:18.840]  And everybody's gay.
[3:09:18.840 --> 3:09:20.840]  Everybody's transgender.
[3:09:20.840 --> 3:09:24.840]  And everybody's minority, as if there's no white people left in the world
[3:09:24.840 --> 3:09:26.840]  and no straight white males.
[3:09:26.840 --> 3:09:29.840]  It's all being shoved down our throat
[3:09:29.840 --> 3:09:34.840]  in the most massive propaganda brainwashing campaign the world's ever known.
[3:09:34.840 --> 3:09:36.840]  And it's not for equality.
[3:09:36.840 --> 3:09:38.840]  I don't mind equality.
[3:09:38.840 --> 3:09:40.840]  It's for superiority.
[3:09:40.840 --> 3:09:46.840]  Every word that comes out of liberals mouths is that white straight males are bad.
[3:09:46.840 --> 3:09:51.840]  We belong in some sort of concentration camps, reeducation camps.
[3:09:51.840 --> 3:09:52.840]  They want to torture us.
[3:09:52.840 --> 3:09:54.840]  They want to ruin our lives.
[3:09:54.840 --> 3:09:56.840]  They want to attach electrodes to our body,
[3:09:56.840 --> 3:09:58.840]  shock us till we say,
[3:09:58.840 --> 3:10:01.840]  yes, yes, I love transgenders.
[3:10:01.840 --> 3:10:04.840]  They should make up the entire military force.
[3:10:04.840 --> 3:10:06.840]  That's what they're looking for.
[3:10:06.840 --> 3:10:09.840]  Every child in school, every boy should be a girl.
[3:10:09.840 --> 3:10:11.840]  Every girl should be a boy.
[3:10:11.840 --> 3:10:12.840]  One should be proud.
[3:10:12.840 --> 3:10:14.840]  They want us to say that.
[3:10:14.840 --> 3:10:15.840]  It's sick.
[3:10:15.840 --> 3:10:17.840]  It's mental illness.
[3:10:17.840 --> 3:10:20.840]  If you want to be gay, if you're born gay, great.
[3:10:20.840 --> 3:10:22.840]  Hey, I've nothing against you.
[3:10:22.840 --> 3:10:27.840]  But Target is now partnering with a queer company to feature binders
[3:10:27.840 --> 3:10:32.840]  and packing briefs from a company called Tomboy X.
[3:10:32.840 --> 3:10:38.840]  And the photo they're showing is two incredibly large sized women
[3:10:38.840 --> 3:10:43.840]  with their arms around each other in an embrace and tattoos up and down their arms.
[3:10:43.840 --> 3:10:48.840]  Let me explain to you what binders and packing briefs are.
[3:10:48.840 --> 3:10:51.840]  Because if you don't know, it doesn't surprise me.
[3:10:51.840 --> 3:10:53.840]  I didn't know.
[3:10:53.840 --> 3:10:55.840]  I've never heard of things like this.
[3:10:55.840 --> 3:10:59.840]  It's an entire country that's gone mental illness,
[3:10:59.840 --> 3:11:04.840]  local, crazy, not so, the whole country.
[3:11:04.840 --> 3:11:06.840]  Do you know what binders are?
[3:11:06.840 --> 3:11:09.840]  When girls want to be boys, they can't have breasts.
[3:11:09.840 --> 3:11:14.840]  So instead of wearing a bra that pushes your breasts up and attracts normal men,
[3:11:14.840 --> 3:11:20.840]  you wear a binder that ties your breasts in so you look like a man that has no breasts.
[3:11:20.840 --> 3:11:22.840]  Even though you're a girl.
[3:11:22.840 --> 3:11:24.840]  Do you know what packing briefs are?
[3:11:24.840 --> 3:11:26.840]  I'll bet you can guess.
[3:11:26.840 --> 3:11:28.840]  It's for boys who want to be girls.
[3:11:28.840 --> 3:11:32.840]  If you're a girl, you wouldn't have an appendage sticking out.
[3:11:32.840 --> 3:11:34.840]  You wouldn't have a penis, right?
[3:11:34.840 --> 3:11:38.840]  They have you put on packing briefs that are so tight like binders.
[3:11:38.840 --> 3:11:41.840]  Pulling a woman's breasts in so you look more like a man.
[3:11:41.840 --> 3:11:46.840]  They're pulling your penis in so it looks like you're a girl and you're not packing.
[3:11:46.840 --> 3:11:47.840]  Get it?
[3:11:47.840 --> 3:11:56.840]  So those are packing briefs, those are binders and Target is proud to be selling that to the transgender generation.
[3:11:56.840 --> 3:11:58.840]  Now here's my point.
[3:11:58.840 --> 3:12:00.840]  Oh God, look at that picture.
[3:12:00.840 --> 3:12:01.840]  Here's my point.
[3:12:01.840 --> 3:12:02.840]  I'm going to vomit.
[3:12:02.840 --> 3:12:04.840]  I swear on national TV.
[3:12:04.840 --> 3:12:07.840]  Just to show you again how open-minded I am.
[3:12:07.840 --> 3:12:09.840]  I was the libertarian.
[3:12:09.840 --> 3:12:14.840]  I was a presidential candidate in 2008 and I campaigned all over the country.
[3:12:14.840 --> 3:12:17.840]  I went to 50 libertarian state conventions.
[3:12:17.840 --> 3:12:24.840]  I've been a Republican my whole life, but for one year I decided to try and win the libertarian presidential nomination
[3:12:24.840 --> 3:12:30.840]  because I was so angry at George W. Bush who I thought was one of the worst presidents ever and a Republican so bad.
[3:12:30.840 --> 3:12:33.840]  He convinced everyone to become a Democrat and I was right.
[3:12:33.840 --> 3:12:35.840]  It led to the election of Obama.
[3:12:35.840 --> 3:12:37.840]  That led to the runation of America.
[3:12:37.840 --> 3:12:40.840]  George W. Bush was such a lousy president.
[3:12:40.840 --> 3:12:49.840]  He led to us in the country embracing Obama and that led to the runation of America and that set us down the road to destroying this country where we are now.
[3:12:49.840 --> 3:12:57.840]  So I ran for the libertarian presidential nomination, finished second, almost won the nomination, lost out to Bob Barr.
[3:12:57.840 --> 3:13:00.840]  Bob Barr chose me as his vice presidential running mate.
[3:13:00.840 --> 3:13:10.840]  Congressman Bob Barr, Georgia, who led the impeachment of Clinton and a very credible, well-known high-profile congressman out of Georgia picked me to be his VP nominee.
[3:13:10.840 --> 3:13:15.840]  And I traveled the country on the presidential ticket of the Libertarian Party.
[3:13:15.840 --> 3:13:22.840]  And I tell you this because they asked me to go to the gay parade in San Francisco.
[3:13:22.840 --> 3:13:41.840]  Wayne, the macho straight guy who's never been around a gay parade in my life and never planned to be, was told I was the guy to sit in the convertible and drive in the parade representing the Libertarian Party and wave to the gay crowd who was making out with each other and hugging each other.
[3:13:41.840 --> 3:13:49.840]  And I dutifully did it and enjoyed myself and had a good time and was very nice as I always am to everybody.
[3:13:49.840 --> 3:13:55.840]  All my life I've been nice to everyone, no matter what I'm thinking inside. You're all crazy. You're all nuts. You're all radical.
[3:13:55.840 --> 3:14:00.840]  I was nice. I was nice to every gay person I met. I have no problem with gay people.
[3:14:00.840 --> 3:14:07.840]  I have a problem with transgender brainwashing in kindergarten through 12th grade, let alone third grade.
[3:14:07.840 --> 3:14:12.840]  But I have no problem if you want to be gay and hug each other and kiss each other, you go do it.
[3:14:12.840 --> 3:14:20.840]  So I sat in that car and I waved at the gay parade in San Francisco to the whole crowd. I've been a pro-gay conservative Republican my whole life.
[3:14:20.840 --> 3:14:27.840]  If you want to be gay, be gay. If you want to get married, get married. Who cares? Two women want to get married. Go get married. I don't care.
[3:14:27.840 --> 3:14:32.840]  Two guys want to get married. Whatever you do in the privacy of your bedroom you want to do, be good.
[3:14:32.840 --> 3:14:44.840]  When you want to brainwash my children and convince them to mutilate their genitals at an age where they have no mental ability to make lifelong decisions.
[3:14:44.840 --> 3:14:51.840]  I draw a line when Joe Biden said the MAGA movement is the most extreme movement in America's history. No.
[3:14:51.840 --> 3:14:59.840]  The Democrat Party is the most extreme movement in Democrat history. Everything I believe in is normal. Everything you believe in is normal.
[3:14:59.840 --> 3:15:04.840]  It's God's will. It's the Bible. This is abnormal.
[3:15:04.840 --> 3:15:13.840]  Packing briefs and binders for girls who want to make believe they're boys and boys who want to make believe they're girls.
[3:15:13.840 --> 3:15:20.840]  So folks, it's time to pick up a copy of my book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book. I've got all the contact information.
[3:15:20.840 --> 3:15:27.840]  Disney we took care of and let's keep taking care of them. Boycott them and starve them. Target is the new Disney.
[3:15:27.840 --> 3:15:33.840]  Target Corporation is the new Disney. All the contact information is in the book. How did I know?
[3:15:33.840 --> 3:15:40.840]  I just knew who was going to go crazy and be radical and be liberal and be woke and be communist. And I was right.
[3:15:40.840 --> 3:15:47.840]  Target's the new Disney. Make them our target. Destroy their ability to be woke.
[3:15:47.840 --> 3:15:52.840]  The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book
[3:16:18.840 --> 3:16:23.840]  Formulated to improve upon our best selling product knockout with down and out.
[3:16:23.840 --> 3:16:28.840]  Now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[3:16:28.840 --> 3:16:33.840]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[3:16:33.840 --> 3:16:41.840]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees
[3:16:41.840 --> 3:16:48.840]  who used it for its relaxing qualities. Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep
[3:16:48.840 --> 3:17:15.840]  because you will be down and out. Sell it out now at infowarstore.com.

[3:20:05.840 --> 3:20:20.840]  All right, Wayne Allyn Root. So many things to talk about. I don't know where to begin. So let me begin with a little intro as to who I am.
[3:20:20.840 --> 3:20:25.840]  I opened the show with my book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book. You just saw that on the screen. I'm Wayne Allyn Root.
[3:20:25.840 --> 3:20:50.840]  You can go to my website, rootforamerica.com, rootrotforamerica.com, and everything starts there.
[3:20:50.840 --> 3:20:55.840]  My radio show is a button right near the top that says listen to the radio show live now.
[3:20:55.840 --> 3:21:01.840]  And when it's on the air, 6 to 9 p.m. Eastern, 3 to 6 Pacific, you click on it and you're automatically listening.
[3:21:01.840 --> 3:21:11.840]  Or you can go to USA Radio to listen. You've got a button up, rootforamerica, to listen to my podcast, war, raw, seven days a week, including the weekend edition that's on video.
[3:21:11.840 --> 3:21:25.840]  And that video is at rootforamerica.com every single Friday afternoon and throughout the weekend with America's top 10 stories that you all need to know of your conservatives, of your Christians, of your patriots, of your deplorables, etc.
[3:21:25.840 --> 3:21:35.840]  These are the stories you need to know. As I always say, if you love God, guns, gold, tax cuts, and Trump, war, raws for you and Wayne Allyn Root, raw and unfiltered is for you.
[3:21:35.840 --> 3:21:49.840]  And then we've got my email, Wayne Root at gmail.com. I love to hear from you. And on the Alex Jones show, when I give out this email, they just pour in because you guys are the greatest engaged audience.
[3:21:49.840 --> 3:21:57.840]  You know the country's being ripped apart. You know it's a purposeful, intentional attack on America. It's not a mistake.
[3:21:57.840 --> 3:22:11.840]  And you know that we've got it all stick together. So the emails I get are amazing. You're all salt of the earth, blue collar, middle class, working class people, the typical Trump voter who they're trying to take the country away from and destroy your life.
[3:22:11.840 --> 3:22:25.840]  Wayne Root at gmail.com. I love to hear from you. And you can sign up at rootforamerica.com and join my mailing list. And I'll send you all my columns, all my videos, everything's at rootforamerica.com.
[3:22:25.840 --> 3:22:36.840]  There is some hope in America. It's not just negative. And that's the thing. We hear so much negative and it's bad. This attack is awful and intentional purposeful attack on America.
[3:22:36.840 --> 3:22:44.840]  But it isn't all bad. Some of the news is good. Here was my most recent column, Meet the Greatest GOP Salesman in History.
[3:22:44.840 --> 3:23:04.840]  I've been a Republican for a long, long time. I'm only 60 years old, but I've been a true blue Republican for 57 years since 1964, when I was three years old, handing out political campaign literature for Barry Goldwater in my father's arms in Malvern in New York at a train station.
[3:23:04.840 --> 3:23:15.840]  So I've been a Republican a long time. So I think I know a thing or two about the Republican Party. So who is the greatest Republican salesman of all time? You can make the argument it's Ronald Reagan.
[3:23:15.840 --> 3:23:31.840]  He was my hero and he was certainly one of the great presidents in the history of America and certainly one of the greatest economic presidents who took Jimmy Carter's economic nightmare and disaster and turned it into the greatest economic recovery in the history of the world in just two short years.
[3:23:31.840 --> 3:23:38.840]  Amazing. And he turned a whole generation of young people into proud Republicans. Thank you, Ronald Reagan. We love you.
[3:23:38.840 --> 3:23:57.840]  A strong argument could be made. It's Donald Trump. He not only upset Hillary Clinton in what was probably the biggest upset in the history of American presidential politics while she was spying on him and knew everything he was going to do and knew his campaign plans and knew his entire speeches because she was spying on him like Watergate.
[3:23:57.840 --> 3:24:12.840]  He's still leader. And then in 2020 he got the most votes of any Republican in history. He got the most votes of any sitting president in history. He got the most new votes of any president in second run for office in history. 11 million new voters.
[3:24:12.840 --> 3:24:25.840]  And so Donald Trump is amazing. He also this year 2022 has endorsed 55 Republican candidates and primaries around the country. His records 55 and oh, he's an amazing guy.
[3:24:25.840 --> 3:24:40.840]  He's not the GOP anymore. It's the DJT, the Donald J. Trump Party, Donald John Trump Party. Now that's a great salesman. That's an epic salesman. That's a legendary salesman. Trump is the goat, the greatest of all time.
[3:24:40.840 --> 3:25:00.840]  I've called him that before. But in the end, I still got to argue the single greatest GOP salesman in history is Joe Biden. This guy has done more to convert the whole America into Republicans and have a distaste for Democrats that anybody could ever hope to do.
[3:25:00.840 --> 3:25:12.840]  Never has anyone done a better job in 18 months to destroy a country. He's turned the greatest country in world history into a combination of basket case and dumpster fire.
[3:25:12.840 --> 3:25:34.840]  The economy is imploding negative gross domestic product, meaning negative economic growth over 20% real inflation on the ground. Forget the 8% number, the real inflation figure, 20% personal incomes year to year down by over 20% manufacturing already.
[3:25:34.840 --> 3:25:47.840]  The numbers show we're entering recession. Worker productivity, the lowest since 1947, and the stock market crashing day after day after day for six weeks now.
[3:25:47.840 --> 3:25:58.840]  Last week, one of the worst weeks in history. A couple of days last week among the worst days in history. And last I looked today, it was crashing again. It was up 500 points and it was down 500.
[3:25:58.840 --> 3:26:05.840]  So I have not looked in an hour. So forgive me, I'm on national TV. But last I looked, it was crashing again.
[3:26:05.840 --> 3:26:18.840]  We are suffering from massive hyperinflation, starting to feel like Zimbabwe meets the Wyomar Republic, the middle class is being destroyed by gas and grocery prices, and it's only going to get much, much worse.
[3:26:18.840 --> 3:26:35.840]  Big cities in the USA look like Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the atomic bomb was dropped because of soft on crime policies by Democrats and Democrat DA's backed by that communist trader, George Soros.
[3:26:35.840 --> 3:26:52.840]  Cities are filled now under Biden with crime and violent crime and murder and homeless bums, intense cities and drug needles and poop and pee. It's unimaginable what he's done to our country and retail stores are being robbed left and right.
[3:26:52.840 --> 3:27:05.840]  And then there's Biden's insane immigration policies, the whole world's coming in because he invited them in and the borders wide open and he's getting rid of what is it titled 42. It's a disaster.
[3:27:05.840 --> 3:27:11.840]  And the crime wave they're going to bring and the welfare they want will bankrupt this country and kill someone close to you.
[3:27:11.840 --> 3:27:26.840]  I haven't even mentioned the thousand pound elephant in the room. Biden's vaccine mandates. Millions of workers had to be forced vaccinated or lose their jobs. And the result is skyrocketing death and disability and crippling injuries across the USA.
[3:27:26.840 --> 3:27:42.840]  And life insurance companies are in a panic. They report non COVID deaths up 40% or higher since the vaccine mandate and we're still the millennial death rate, a staggering 84% up since the vaccines.
[3:27:42.840 --> 3:27:57.840]  And if Biden didn't kill your job with this awful economy or kill your income with this awful inflation or literally kill you with the vaccine. Now he's got us on the verge of World War three with Russia threatening nuclear annihilation.
[3:27:57.840 --> 3:28:05.840]  And I could almost guarantee you, China will be invading Taiwan any day now, which will be a disaster for the United States and pull us into World War three.
[3:28:05.840 --> 3:28:16.840]  I'll finish this commentary when we get back. The world's greatest GOP salesman is Joe Biden. And I'll finish up by proving my point. Thank you, Joe Biden. God bless you.
[3:28:16.840 --> 3:28:23.840]  You're the best thing that ever happened to the GOP. You're convincing everyone to leave the Democratic Party and become a Republican.
[3:28:23.840 --> 3:28:30.840]  The only bad news is you're the worst thing that ever happened to our beloved United States of America.

[3:33:05.840 --> 3:33:21.840]  All right, Wayne Root, welcome back. There's my folks, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book. I just got a, I don't know, I have about 20 emails waiting here for people who are watching the Alex Jones show, WayneRooterGmail.com.
[3:33:21.840 --> 3:33:31.840]  But one of them caught my eye, looked through about 10 of them. Frank says, and currently watching on the Alex Jones show, enjoy your delivery and content as the guest host for the hour.
[3:33:31.840 --> 3:33:35.840]  And by the way, I do this hour every Tuesday. Thank you, Alex Jones and company.
[3:33:35.840 --> 3:33:39.840]  I promptly went to Amazon to buy your new book. Very excited to read it.
[3:33:39.840 --> 3:33:43.840]  Now, why am I mentioning this? Because he says I'm from Winnipeg, Canada.
[3:33:43.840 --> 3:33:51.840]  So not even from America, but believe in what people like yourself stand for and work for and wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[3:33:51.840 --> 3:33:55.840]  God bless Frank. So first of all, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[3:33:55.840 --> 3:34:06.840]  All of us, Alex Jones, me, I don't care who it is, the late Rush Limbaugh, the Michael Savages, the Sean Hannity's, the Mark Levin's, none of us are doing this for us.
[3:34:06.840 --> 3:34:11.840]  We're doing it for American or kids and our future grandkids, and we're doing it for you.
[3:34:11.840 --> 3:34:23.840]  And we're doing it for Canada. We're doing it for Australia and we're doing it for New Zealand and we're doing it for Great Britain and all the countries where the communist, authoritarian, fascist,
[3:34:23.840 --> 3:34:30.840]  new world order, great reset leaders are in place trying to destroy your life.
[3:34:30.840 --> 3:34:37.840]  And so it warms the cockles in my heart when I see letters from Canadians that come in right while I'm on TV to say,
[3:34:37.840 --> 3:34:42.840]  watch your book and I can't wait to read it. And yes, there are great conservatives in Canada.
[3:34:42.840 --> 3:34:47.840]  Yes, there are great conservatives in Australia. Yes, there are great conservatives in Austria.
[3:34:47.840 --> 3:34:56.840]  Everywhere in the world where the communists and the globalists and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and George Soros are trying to take over,
[3:34:56.840 --> 3:35:06.840]  I believe the majority of the people are the silent majority, the middle class and the working class, and they're trying to destroy you, bankrupt you, take your rights away.
[3:35:06.840 --> 3:35:10.840]  Think about it. Think about Cuba. Think about Venezuela.
[3:35:10.840 --> 3:35:18.840]  Those are modern examples of communism and globalism and authoritarianism and dictatorships and tyranny.
[3:35:18.840 --> 3:35:24.840]  And in those countries, there was a rich upper class, rich people and middle class.
[3:35:24.840 --> 3:35:31.840]  And then Castro came along and then Hugo Chavez came along in Venezuela and they instituted socialism.
[3:35:31.840 --> 3:35:41.840]  See, socialism is communism. Don't let people convince you they're two different things. Socialism is the economic system of capitalism.
[3:35:41.840 --> 3:35:47.840]  Socialism is the economic system of communism. They go hand in hand.
[3:35:47.840 --> 3:35:56.840]  Communism is the political system that imprisons you, punishes you and takes everything away from you and tortures you and murders you.
[3:35:56.840 --> 3:36:03.840]  Socialism doesn't do any of that. It's the economic system that bankrupts everything and everyone it touches.
[3:36:03.840 --> 3:36:09.840]  And so it makes all the rich people and all the business owners and all the middle class people that were living great lives.
[3:36:09.840 --> 3:36:14.840]  It makes them all live in poverty and misery and malaise.
[3:36:14.840 --> 3:36:21.840]  Soon you're driving a donkey cart or a 1958 Oldsmobile in 2022.
[3:36:21.840 --> 3:36:27.840]  You've got nothing and you're in a Mad Max landscape, which is what Biden wants for all of us.
[3:36:27.840 --> 3:36:31.840]  And you've got nothing and no way to fight back. Oh, and they take your guns away.
[3:36:31.840 --> 3:36:37.840]  Every country in the history of the world that killed its citizens first took their guns away.
[3:36:37.840 --> 3:36:47.840]  I'm a Jew. Nazi Germany passed the law. No Jew could own a gun before they instituted the Holocaust and murdered my people.
[3:36:47.840 --> 3:36:57.840]  Guns are so important. As long as we all have arsenals in our homes, the government can never totally control us and take advantage of us.
[3:36:57.840 --> 3:37:05.840]  Always fight for the First Amendment so you have freedom of speech and the Second Amendment so you have the guns to back it up.
[3:37:05.840 --> 3:37:11.840]  Without that, you have nothing. So what are Democrats trying to do? Yes, don't tread on me. What are Democrats trying to do?
[3:37:11.840 --> 3:37:23.840]  Take your guns away to your powerless and helpless. And number two, ban you and censor you and burn our conservative books and take away our free speech and social media
[3:37:23.840 --> 3:37:30.840]  and brainwash us with their communist propaganda and their lies about the vaccines and the vaccine mandates.
[3:37:30.840 --> 3:37:35.840]  Those of you who know me know I'm the world's biggest Donald Trump fan. I celebrate in my root form.
[3:37:35.840 --> 3:37:43.840]  But and he was the greatest president in my lifetime. If he had a second term, he would have become the greatest president ever or certainly top five.
[3:37:43.840 --> 3:37:51.840]  But him and I disagree on one topic vehemently. Vaccines. The vaccines are killing people. The vaccines are crippling people.
[3:37:51.840 --> 3:38:02.840]  The vaccines are disabling people. The vaccines are the way to control us and kill us and weaken us and destroy our military and destroy our airline pilots
[3:38:02.840 --> 3:38:09.840]  and destroy our police and our first responders. Why Trump doesn't get that? I have no idea.
[3:38:09.840 --> 3:38:17.840]  But the reason I brought up this Canadian guy, Frank, who sent me that note, thank you, Frank, is a thank you for being a conservative in Canada.
[3:38:17.840 --> 3:38:24.840]  They probably wouldn't believe it, right? They don't think you still exist. And I know secretly most of Canada is conservatives.
[3:38:24.840 --> 3:38:38.840]  But number two, I firmly believe if we want to avoid a civil war, because we're not going to get there with just the vote, you and I know that a vote can no longer take this country back.
[3:38:38.840 --> 3:38:48.840]  Even though I want you all to vote Republican and I want to win the House by a landslide and I want to win the Senate by a large margin and I want to win in 2024, even with rigged elections.
[3:38:48.840 --> 3:38:54.840]  If we have enough voters, we can even overcome the rig like Trump did in 16.
[3:38:54.840 --> 3:39:03.840]  But that's not enough either, because the evil communist globalists all control every lever of government, every government agency.
[3:39:03.840 --> 3:39:11.840]  You saw what they did to Trump. They prevented him for four years from doing everything he really wanted and needed to do.
[3:39:11.840 --> 3:39:25.840]  So they control the school system, they control the colleges, they control the courts, they control the media, they control Hollywood, and they control every government agency and almost every government employee and every teacher and professor.
[3:39:25.840 --> 3:39:36.840]  That's a lot to overcome. So I think personally, and I'll bet you agree with me, we're beyond the point of winning through only elections and voting.
[3:39:36.840 --> 3:39:45.840]  Even though you've all got to vote and every vote counts, I'll never discourage you from voting. I will only encourage you to vote, but it's not enough.
[3:39:45.840 --> 3:39:52.840]  You know it, you feel it, the country's going under, they're destroying it, it's the great reset, and a vote will not be enough.
[3:39:52.840 --> 3:39:59.840]  So here are the choices. We're either going to go in the street and it's going to be a revolution or a civil war, or we're going to do it peacefully.
[3:39:59.840 --> 3:40:06.840]  And I'm rooting for no war, I'm rooting for no civil war, I'm rooting for nobody getting hurt, nobody getting killed.
[3:40:06.840 --> 3:40:13.840]  I'm rooting for the people of the Patriots and the Christians shouldn't be in the street because we'll be fighting with the people we love.
[3:40:13.840 --> 3:40:20.840]  Military, National Guard, policemen, how are you going to do that? We love them. We can't shoot them. We can't fight with them.
[3:40:20.840 --> 3:40:31.840]  So we've got to come up with a peaceful solution, and I've got it. The Roe vs. Wade abortion ruling leads the way to my peaceful solution.
[3:40:31.840 --> 3:40:46.840]  And that is we need a divorce. Think of the EU. Every single state in the EU is its own country, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, England, Netherlands, you name it, Belgium.
[3:40:46.840 --> 3:40:55.840]  They're all their own country with their own laws, their own tax systems, their own cultures, and over them is a banner.
[3:40:55.840 --> 3:41:08.840]  They're all united under the European Union, the EU. Why can't we have 50 states that are countries that are all united under the North American banner of the United States of America?
[3:41:08.840 --> 3:41:18.840]  So that red states go their separate way from blue states, although we may share an army, we may share a national defense, we may share a nuclear power system,
[3:41:18.840 --> 3:41:31.840]  but we each have our own economy, our own tax systems, and our own cultures, just like Europe. That's exactly what I believe needs to happen if we're going to avoid what liberals clearly want.
[3:41:31.840 --> 3:41:42.840]  Communists, liberals, progressives, socialists, Marxists, whatever you want to call them, they are spoiling for the end of America, the end of capitalism and a civil war,
[3:41:42.840 --> 3:41:51.840]  and they want to put government's boot on our necks and control our lives and destroy our lives. And it's clear to me, we can't live with these people anymore,
[3:41:51.840 --> 3:42:04.840]  and their critical race theory, and all white people are evil, and transgenderism is great, and our kids should change their sex and open all the borders, and vaccinate everyone, and mask everyone, and lock down everyone.
[3:42:04.840 --> 3:42:19.840]  They're insane. We need a divorce, a separation, a secession, and the blue states will go their separate ways from the red states, and they'll live their way and we'll live our way with some common bond of the United States of America.
[3:42:19.840 --> 3:42:38.840]  That's what I think is the solution at this moment. I'm Wayne Allyn Root. We'll be right back. RootforAmerica.com. My email is Wayne Root at gmail.com, and my book is The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book at Amazon or Barnes & Noble, or RootforAmerica.com.

[3:46:40.840 --> 3:46:46.840]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[3:46:46.840 --> 3:46:49.840]  We've got to sell this to keep Infowars on the air, plus it spreads the word.
[3:46:49.840 --> 3:46:53.840]  InfowarsStore.com, your historic apparel now, InfowarsStore.com.
[3:46:56.840 --> 3:47:02.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:02.840 --> 3:47:07.840]  I feel good.
[3:47:07.840 --> 3:47:10.840]  All right, Wayne.
[3:47:10.840 --> 3:47:11.840]  Welcome back.
[3:47:11.840 --> 3:47:13.840]  Wayne Root at gmail.com is my email.
[3:47:13.840 --> 3:47:17.840]  I keep getting emails from all of you wonderful people and I love to hear from you.
[3:47:17.840 --> 3:47:18.840]  So that's number one.
[3:47:18.840 --> 3:47:21.840]  Number two is rootforamerica.com, my website.
[3:47:21.840 --> 3:47:24.840]  And number three is my book, The Great Patriot, protest and boycott book.
[3:47:24.840 --> 3:47:31.840]  And I never got a chance to finish because we're going out of why I think that the Roe versus Wade decision
[3:47:31.840 --> 3:47:38.840]  if it holds up will be the perfect entree for my idea, my vision, my argument
[3:47:38.840 --> 3:47:43.840]  that we need to have separate states that are like countries with their own culture,
[3:47:43.840 --> 3:47:46.840]  their own tax system, their own beliefs.
[3:47:46.840 --> 3:47:49.840]  And, you know, just like Europe under the blanket of the EU,
[3:47:49.840 --> 3:47:52.840]  we could be under the blanket of the United States or under North America.
[3:47:52.840 --> 3:47:56.840]  But the reality is we each have our own red states going our separate way.
[3:47:56.840 --> 3:47:57.840]  Why do I say that?
[3:47:57.840 --> 3:48:03.840]  Because liberals are the ones who are going to lose their minds if, in fact,
[3:48:03.840 --> 3:48:09.840]  the Supreme Court is ruling that Roe versus Wade is no more and it's a state's rights issue.
[3:48:09.840 --> 3:48:12.840]  They're not ending abortion as we know it.
[3:48:12.840 --> 3:48:13.840]  That's a lie.
[3:48:13.840 --> 3:48:15.840]  They're not doing anything to end abortion.
[3:48:15.840 --> 3:48:20.840]  Each state gets to make their own decision as per the Constitution
[3:48:20.840 --> 3:48:23.840]  and what the founding fathers had a vision of.
[3:48:23.840 --> 3:48:24.840]  It's correct.
[3:48:24.840 --> 3:48:27.840]  Each state should make their own decision.
[3:48:27.840 --> 3:48:32.840]  And if you're against abortion and you believe it's murder and you're a strong Christian,
[3:48:32.840 --> 3:48:36.840]  make sure your state bans abortion or severely limits abortion.
[3:48:36.840 --> 3:48:42.840]  But liberals like, you know, California, New York, Maryland, Illinois, Rhode Island,
[3:48:42.840 --> 3:48:47.840]  Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, very blue states.
[3:48:47.840 --> 3:48:53.840]  Massachusetts will certainly have legal abortion and red states will not.
[3:48:53.840 --> 3:48:59.840]  It'll be no abortion or very limited, severe restrictions on abortion as it should be.
[3:48:59.840 --> 3:49:02.840]  And so liberals will move out of those states.
[3:49:02.840 --> 3:49:09.840]  Liberal women, feminists and liberals in general can never live in a state where abortion is banned.
[3:49:09.840 --> 3:49:11.840]  They'll lose their mind.
[3:49:11.840 --> 3:49:17.840]  They'll all move to California, which makes our states much better places to live.
[3:49:17.840 --> 3:49:19.840]  Goodbye, God bless you.
[3:49:19.840 --> 3:49:21.840]  Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
[3:49:21.840 --> 3:49:22.840]  See you later.
[3:49:22.840 --> 3:49:25.840]  Arriva Durche, you know, don't be back.
[3:49:25.840 --> 3:49:27.840]  So it's great.
[3:49:27.840 --> 3:49:30.840]  This ruling doesn't ban abortion.
[3:49:30.840 --> 3:49:36.840]  It makes it a state's rights issue, which makes it more likely that states will pull away from each other.
[3:49:36.840 --> 3:49:41.840]  California will have nothing in common with Texas, right?
[3:49:41.840 --> 3:49:45.840]  New York will have nothing in common with Florida.
[3:49:45.840 --> 3:49:50.840]  And conservatives will flee New York for Florida and Texas and my state, Nevada.
[3:49:50.840 --> 3:49:55.840]  California and conservatives will flee California for Nevada and Florida and Texas.
[3:49:55.840 --> 3:50:03.840]  And people in Florida and Texas who are liberal will flee for California and New York.
[3:50:03.840 --> 3:50:07.840]  Yet it that's the way I foresee America in the future.
[3:50:07.840 --> 3:50:13.840]  If we want to avoid civil war, avoid revolution, we have a peaceful answer.
[3:50:13.840 --> 3:50:15.840]  That answer is divorce.
[3:50:15.840 --> 3:50:16.840]  I don't call it secession.
[3:50:16.840 --> 3:50:20.840]  Secession reminds people of the Civil War divorce.
[3:50:20.840 --> 3:50:22.840]  Everyone's comfortable with divorce.
[3:50:22.840 --> 3:50:23.840]  Everybody's witnessed it.
[3:50:23.840 --> 3:50:25.840]  Everyone's experienced it.
[3:50:25.840 --> 3:50:26.840]  Either you've been divorced.
[3:50:26.840 --> 3:50:29.840]  One of your kids is currently divorced or about to get divorced.
[3:50:29.840 --> 3:50:32.840]  Or you grew up with a mom and a dad that were divorced.
[3:50:32.840 --> 3:50:35.840]  Everyone's been through a divorce of some kind or another.
[3:50:35.840 --> 3:50:37.840]  It's not the end of the world.
[3:50:37.840 --> 3:50:40.840]  In many ways, it makes your life better.
[3:50:40.840 --> 3:50:45.840]  I was divorced a few years ago and I'm remarried to the most beautiful, wonderful woman in the world.
[3:50:45.840 --> 3:50:46.840]  Cindy Parker Root.
[3:50:46.840 --> 3:50:48.840]  And so I'm thrilled.
[3:50:48.840 --> 3:50:49.840]  It all worked out great.
[3:50:49.840 --> 3:50:51.840]  Thank God I got divorced.
[3:50:51.840 --> 3:50:55.840]  I'm sad I got divorced, but thank God it led to a better life.
[3:50:55.840 --> 3:51:00.840]  I think America needs a divorce and it'll lead to a better life for all of us.
[3:51:00.840 --> 3:51:01.840]  Think about this liberals.
[3:51:01.840 --> 3:51:03.840]  Wayne Root is making common sense.
[3:51:03.840 --> 3:51:05.840]  It's a win-win.
[3:51:05.840 --> 3:51:08.840]  You get open borders in California.
[3:51:08.840 --> 3:51:10.840]  You get illegal serving as policemen.
[3:51:10.840 --> 3:51:12.840]  You get illegal serving as judges.
[3:51:12.840 --> 3:51:17.840]  You get illegal serving as defenders in front of the court, public defenders.
[3:51:17.840 --> 3:51:19.840]  You get everything you ever wanted.
[3:51:19.840 --> 3:51:21.840]  Illegals get all the welfare they want.
[3:51:21.840 --> 3:51:23.840]  You have all the open borders you want.
[3:51:23.840 --> 3:51:24.840]  They all get free.
[3:51:24.840 --> 3:51:25.840]  They get to vote.
[3:51:25.840 --> 3:51:26.840]  They get free medical.
[3:51:26.840 --> 3:51:31.840]  And you get vaccine mandates for everyone and mask mandates for everyone.
[3:51:31.840 --> 3:51:37.840]  And you can lock down the whole state with vaccines and masks for the rest of your freaking life.
[3:51:37.840 --> 3:51:40.840]  You could all hide in your home with masks on.
[3:51:40.840 --> 3:51:46.840]  You could all love Joe Biden and kneel down to the vaccine God you love and the Biden God you love.
[3:51:46.840 --> 3:51:49.840]  You know, your God has dementia, but you don't notice that.
[3:51:49.840 --> 3:51:50.840]  So that's okay.
[3:51:50.840 --> 3:51:53.840]  And you can have all the green energy you want.
[3:51:53.840 --> 3:51:58.840]  So that in the winter, in the summer, there's massive breakdowns and you freeze and burn to death.
[3:51:58.840 --> 3:51:59.840]  God bless you.
[3:51:59.840 --> 3:52:00.840]  That's great.
[3:52:00.840 --> 3:52:02.840]  You can have what you want.
[3:52:02.840 --> 3:52:04.840]  No more policemen in your states.
[3:52:04.840 --> 3:52:07.840]  It'll all be social workers who show up when you call.
[3:52:07.840 --> 3:52:08.840]  You're being murdered.
[3:52:08.840 --> 3:52:10.840]  They'll send the social worker with no weapon.
[3:52:10.840 --> 3:52:12.840]  California can have all that.
[3:52:12.840 --> 3:52:14.840]  New York can have all that.
[3:52:14.840 --> 3:52:16.840]  The streets will belong to the thugs.
[3:52:16.840 --> 3:52:19.840]  People will be murdered in the middle of the street in broad daylight.
[3:52:19.840 --> 3:52:20.840]  God bless it.
[3:52:20.840 --> 3:52:21.840]  Liberals love it.
[3:52:21.840 --> 3:52:23.840]  That's your state.
[3:52:23.840 --> 3:52:26.840]  Homeless and tense and poo and pee in the street.
[3:52:26.840 --> 3:52:29.840]  Everything you ever wanted.
[3:52:29.840 --> 3:52:31.840]  And we will have none of that.
[3:52:31.840 --> 3:52:33.840]  My state will have closed borders.
[3:52:33.840 --> 3:52:38.840]  My state will have no illegal aliens and no illegals voting.
[3:52:38.840 --> 3:52:40.840]  And my state won't give welfare to illegal aliens.
[3:52:40.840 --> 3:52:43.840]  My state won't give free healthcare to illegal aliens.
[3:52:43.840 --> 3:52:49.840]  You will not be able to go to college if you're an illegal alien in my state for free while good citizens pay for it.
[3:52:49.840 --> 3:52:51.840]  This is ridiculous.
[3:52:51.840 --> 3:52:57.840]  We won't have vaccine mandates or mask mandates or any lockdowns ever in my state, right?
[3:52:57.840 --> 3:52:59.840]  We'll all have what we want.
[3:52:59.840 --> 3:53:01.840]  Why would you argue about that?
[3:53:01.840 --> 3:53:03.840]  Isn't that wonderful?
[3:53:03.840 --> 3:53:05.840]  Isn't that the definition of win-win?
[3:53:05.840 --> 3:53:07.840]  We need a secession.
[3:53:07.840 --> 3:53:09.840]  But I don't want to call it a secession.
[3:53:09.840 --> 3:53:11.840]  That's a bad word.
[3:53:11.840 --> 3:53:13.840]  We need a divorce.
[3:53:13.840 --> 3:53:18.840]  All of America is familiar and comfortable, if not sad, with divorce.
[3:53:18.840 --> 3:53:21.840]  We don't want it, but we've all experienced it.
[3:53:21.840 --> 3:53:23.840]  America needs a divorce.
[3:53:23.840 --> 3:53:25.840]  That's what we've got to have.
[3:53:25.840 --> 3:53:27.840]  I can't live with you.
[3:53:27.840 --> 3:53:28.840]  You're all crazy.
[3:53:28.840 --> 3:53:30.840]  Oh, you know what I left out?
[3:53:30.840 --> 3:53:33.840]  Blue states, your children will all be brainwashed.
[3:53:33.840 --> 3:53:36.840]  All the boys will dress as girls.
[3:53:36.840 --> 3:53:39.840]  And all the girls will dress as boys.
[3:53:39.840 --> 3:53:42.840]  And the girls will wear their target binders.
[3:53:42.840 --> 3:53:46.840]  And the boys will wear their whatever the hell they call the thing that holds their thing in.
[3:53:46.840 --> 3:53:48.840]  And you'll all be crazy together.
[3:53:48.840 --> 3:53:50.840]  You whacked out nutjobs.
[3:53:50.840 --> 3:53:53.840]  All of you will believe white people are evil.
[3:53:53.840 --> 3:53:58.840]  And that's your right in your state country called Cala, Mexico.
[3:53:58.840 --> 3:54:00.840]  God bless you.
[3:54:00.840 --> 3:54:03.840]  In New York, you'll all live happily ever after.
[3:54:03.840 --> 3:54:10.840]  The entire state will be a bunch of transgenders running around women with penises and men with vaginas.
[3:54:10.840 --> 3:54:12.840]  God bless New York.
[3:54:12.840 --> 3:54:14.840]  I'm sorry I was ever born there.
[3:54:14.840 --> 3:54:16.840]  And I never want to see it again.
[3:54:16.840 --> 3:54:18.840]  You can go to hell, New York.
[3:54:18.840 --> 3:54:21.840]  So we will live in red states where everything will be normal.
[3:54:21.840 --> 3:54:25.840]  All of you will get your bizarre, abnormal behavior out.
[3:54:25.840 --> 3:54:31.840]  And you can have all the parades you want for transgenders and boys who become girls and girls who become boys.
[3:54:31.840 --> 3:54:39.840]  And they'll all be watched over, not by policemen at the parade, but by social workers with a pen, not a gun.
[3:54:39.840 --> 3:54:41.840]  Isn't that the liberal dream?
[3:54:41.840 --> 3:54:44.840]  And you'll all be riding around in electric cars.
[3:54:44.840 --> 3:54:46.840]  Oh, it's so wonderful.
[3:54:46.840 --> 3:54:48.840]  So that's it.
[3:54:48.840 --> 3:54:49.840]  That's the answer.
[3:54:49.840 --> 3:54:51.840]  It's a divorce.
[3:54:51.840 --> 3:54:58.840]  We all need a divorce in the United States of America because I've come to realize I can't live with you people.
[3:54:58.840 --> 3:55:00.840]  I can't live under you people.
[3:55:00.840 --> 3:55:02.840]  I will never take orders from you people.
[3:55:02.840 --> 3:55:04.840]  You're all crazy.
[3:55:04.840 --> 3:55:14.840]  Your brain damage like Joe Biden and you have no right to rule my life and tell me what to do because everything you believe in is bizarre.
[3:55:14.840 --> 3:55:23.840]  And by the way, I left out in the blue states, they will censor, they'll book ban, they will ban anyone from speaking who doesn't agree with them.
[3:55:23.840 --> 3:55:26.840]  They'll put you in some sort of Twitter hell.
[3:55:26.840 --> 3:55:29.840]  They'll put you in some sort of reeducation camp.
[3:55:29.840 --> 3:55:31.840]  They'll torch you and brainwash you.
[3:55:31.840 --> 3:55:33.840]  They'll take your property away.
[3:55:33.840 --> 3:55:41.840]  And in red states, we'll all live under wonderful capitalism and we'll all make money and enjoy prosperity for the rest of all time.
[3:55:41.840 --> 3:55:47.840]  God bless Texas, Florida and Wyoming and Idaho and maybe Montana.
[3:55:47.840 --> 3:55:58.840]  And I hope my state of Nevada every day the whole California moves here and every one of them that I meet is a Republican movie here escaping from the madness of California.
[3:55:58.840 --> 3:56:01.840]  I hope you're making my state a red state, but we shall see.
[3:56:01.840 --> 3:56:03.840]  I believe the elections are rigged.
[3:56:03.840 --> 3:56:05.840]  So it really doesn't matter.
[3:56:05.840 --> 3:56:09.840]  Once Democrats get in control, they rig it so Republicans can never win.
[3:56:09.840 --> 3:56:16.840]  I promised you I'd finish up the commentary I started about the greatest GOP salesman of all time, Joe Biden.
[3:56:16.840 --> 3:56:19.840]  I talked about all the terrible things Biden has done.
[3:56:19.840 --> 3:56:20.840]  Here's the result.
[3:56:20.840 --> 3:56:26.840]  Latinos have moved from lifelong Democrats to a double digit GOP lead.
[3:56:26.840 --> 3:56:35.840]  Can you imagine Biden has changed the political beliefs of an entire race of people in the United States in only 18 months.
[3:56:35.840 --> 3:56:43.840]  And parents with children under the age of 18 are now supporting the GOP by a 21 point landslide.
[3:56:43.840 --> 3:56:47.840]  Biden has turned liberal mothers into GOP mama bears.
[3:56:47.840 --> 3:56:50.840]  Even young people are becoming Republicans.
[3:56:50.840 --> 3:56:55.840]  Biden's ratings are lower among young people than any other age group in the United States.
[3:56:55.840 --> 3:57:02.840]  So Trump is superhuman, but Biden wins my award as the greatest GOP salesman in history.
[3:57:02.840 --> 3:57:03.840]  Thanks, Joe.
[3:57:03.840 --> 3:57:04.840]  You're the best.
[3:57:04.840 --> 3:57:06.840]  Nobody has ever done it better.
[3:57:06.840 --> 3:57:10.840]  Wade Allen root guest host for Alex Jones every Tuesday in this hour.
[3:57:10.840 --> 3:57:15.840]  Wayne root at gmail.com root for America.com.
[3:57:15.840 --> 3:57:22.840]  And the great patriot protest and boycott book is my baby coming up next.
[3:57:22.840 --> 3:57:45.840]  Before of Alex Jones.
[3:57:45.840 --> 3:57:46.840]  You see this.
[3:57:46.840 --> 3:57:56.840]  You see this.

[3:58:01.840 --> 3:58:11.840]  The bank that owns the men that has started putting these out the last few years just sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than we're selling this for.
[3:58:11.840 --> 3:58:15.840]  And when you get three or more, you can get these at 50% off and they fund the info war.

[3:58:53.840 --> 3:58:54.840]  William in California.
[3:58:54.840 --> 3:58:56.840]  People are asleep and programmed controlled.
[3:58:56.840 --> 3:58:57.840]  I agree.
[3:58:57.840 --> 3:58:59.840]  How do you make the sleeper awaken, William?
[3:58:59.840 --> 3:59:00.840]  Oh, hi, Alice.
[3:59:00.840 --> 3:59:01.840]  Thanks for taking my call.
[3:59:01.840 --> 3:59:03.840]  Can I plug, uh, Alex real quick?
[3:59:03.840 --> 3:59:04.840]  Yeah, go ahead.
[3:59:04.840 --> 3:59:11.840]  I'm in my sixties and I did the work of 25, 30 year olds and I worked them into the ground and you wanted to why?
[3:59:11.840 --> 3:59:17.840]  And I've tested this and I've taken your B12 and let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price.
[3:59:17.840 --> 3:59:18.840]  I really do.
[3:59:18.840 --> 3:59:21.840]  I take that B12 and I'm electric, man.
[3:59:21.840 --> 3:59:22.840]  I can run 10 miles.
[3:59:22.840 --> 3:59:32.840]  I did some pretty heavy work with a highway department and my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah, for a guy in his sixties, you know, pushing 70.
[3:59:32.840 --> 3:59:34.840]  I'm not just blowing smoke here.
[3:59:34.840 --> 4:00:03.840]  The B12 saves my life.
