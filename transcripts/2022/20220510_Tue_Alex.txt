[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:06.574]  So it's good to know your enemy and it's good to know where their mindset and their systems of thought come from.
[00:00:08.255 --> 00:00:23.766]  And so let's do some of that here together today and understand why they're incrementally turning off the infrastructure, why they're incrementally dumbing down the population, why they're by degree poisoning us and dividing and conquering us.
[00:00:23.826 --> 00:00:35.532]   And that's because it's a pretext for them to get total control and power To claim the Earth has reached its carrying capacity and there are too many people.
[00:00:36.573 --> 00:00:52.523]  And so they've got to bring in a world dictatorship, and I'm about to play you them saying that, at the World Economic Forum, to save the Earth from the humans and have a peaceful extermination of at least 90% of the world population.
[00:00:53.344 --> 00:01:01.250]   This is the entire mindset These people this is their worldview. This is their
[00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.640]   religion. This is what they are. This is who they are and it's their mission and
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.080]   Really it's the excuse for their power and control now you can have a debate
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.670]   About whether the earth is overpopulated and certainly in some areas it is and certainly society's broken down and
[00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.810]   humanity's lost its way But the idea that we're gonna let the very worst greedy out-of-control
[00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.080]   people that follow none of their own advice and
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.080]  Who are super predators?
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.990]   Sell us on Exterminating 90% of our fellow humans, you know, they're
[00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:48.040]   not gonna stop with them [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:01:39.054 --> 00:01:44.174]   And in fact, when you get deeper into their teachings and in their mindsets,
[00:01:44.174 --> 00:01:49.853]   they actually say, "We're getting rid of all humans. We're gods. We're merging with machines."
[00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:59.853]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:01.703]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:02:01.703 --> 00:02:15.762]   Attorney generals from 20 conservative states are threatening legal action against the Department of Homeland
[00:02:15.762 --> 00:02:20.663]   Security's newly formed Disinformation Governance Board, which they said will have
[00:02:20.663 --> 00:02:25.402]   a chilling effect on freedom of expression and described it as un-American.
[00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:28.332]  Unconstitutional would be the word I would use.
[00:02:28.592 --> 00:02:39.035]  Now, the good news is, is that almost all the big tech platforms now acknowledge some responsibility for content on their platforms, and they're investing in large teams of people to monitor it.
[00:02:39.255 --> 00:02:47.098]   While content moderation can limit the distribution of clearly dangerous content, It doesn't go far enough.
[00:02:47.278 --> 00:02:53.321]  This MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that's existed in American history.
[00:02:53.841 --> 00:03:13.668]  If it were that simple, it would merely be irony that the Biden administration, led by its chronic serial fabricator-in-chief, is just gonna bypass that worthless old First Amendment and set up an Orwellian ministry of truth led by esteemed disinformation regurgitator Nina Jankowicz.
[00:03:13.928 --> 00:03:38.164]  So what I'm encouraging individuals to do, in particular, just your normal, average, everyday citizen, is to practice informational distancing, where recognizing that disinformation and misinformation often run on emotional manipulation, when you feel your emotions rising, to just walk away from your device for a little bit, let yourself cool down, and then start to consider the source.
[00:03:38.605 --> 00:03:43.668]  Why does that particular source have an interest in emotionally manipulating you?
[00:03:44.468 --> 00:03:47.671]  We're going to begin tonight with that alleged terror plot and the chilling plan.
[00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:50.854]  The FBI says it stopped before it could be carried out.
[00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:55.798]  A plan to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and then what they were planning to do to her.
[00:03:56.438 --> 00:04:01.242]  Thirteen suspects arrested including seven alleged members of a right-wing militia group.
[00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:12.049]  The local four defenders first told you the men charged in the plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer say the men who trained them the entire time were undercover FBI agents.
[00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:27.098]  Now, a new court filing obtained by the defenders, filed by so-called ringleader Adam Fox, says paid FBI informants were also the ones to come up with the plan to kidnap the governor and attack her summer home.
[00:04:27.418 --> 00:04:37.743]  Jenkiewicz has praised the debunked dossier author Christopher Steele and vehemently claimed that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation.
[00:04:37.804 --> 00:04:43.483]   But Jankowicz's manic zealotry is far more complicated than what appears on the surface.
[00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:56.363]   Jankowicz's resume reads like a quintessential job application to the
[00:04:56.363 --> 00:05:06.860]   Biden Ukrainian Corruption Corporation, an organization Hell-bent on New World Order Russia regime change, fueled by the fleecing of the American taxpayer.
[00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:10.543]  In 2010, Jankiewicz attended a university in Russia.
[00:05:10.883 --> 00:05:17.387]  In 2017, she was a Fulbright Fellow in Kiev, working alongside the Foreign Ministry of Ukraine.
[00:05:17.708 --> 00:05:30.156]  She has also served as a Disinformation Fellow at the treasonous Woodrow Wilson Center, and as supervisor of the Russia and Belarus programs at the National Democratic Institute.
[00:05:30.436 --> 00:05:39.019]  Republicans are criticizing your decision, the administration's decision to choose Nina Jankowicz to lead this disinformation board.
[00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:41.480]  They say she is not somebody who is neutral.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.480]  Your response?
[00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:44.021]  Eminently qualified.
[00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:47.502]  A renowned expert in the field of disinformation.
[00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:48.163]  And neutral?
[00:05:48.203 --> 00:05:48.923]  Absolutely so.
[00:05:49.865 --> 00:05:54.026]   Honouring is really quite ferocious, it's when a hoxta takes some lies and makes them
[00:05:54.026 --> 00:05:57.625]   sound precocious by selling them in Congress or a mainstream outlet.
[00:05:57.625 --> 00:06:01.544]  So, disinformation's origins are slightly less atrocious.
[00:06:01.544 --> 00:06:07.704]   When the department picked her, was the department aware of her TikTok videos?
[00:06:07.704 --> 00:06:11.305]  Senator, I was...
[00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:14.105]  They're really quite precocious.
[00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:19.811]  Senator, I was not aware of those videos.
[00:06:20.092 --> 00:06:27.816]  And as the multi-millionaire Wall Street leeching Democratic Party eggs on World War III and funnels in billions of U.S.
[00:06:27.876 --> 00:06:32.998]   taxpayer dollars to one of the most corrupt countries on Earth, Ukraine.
[00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:36.541]  Corruption blatantly tied to the Biden family.
[00:06:36.821 --> 00:06:43.005]  Jenkiewicz fronts an effort mirroring the totalitarianism being wielded on Ukrainian dissenters.
[00:06:43.325 --> 00:06:48.449]  An effort that would make the Ukrainian Goebbels-worshipping Azov battalion very proud.
[00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:52.552]  Ask yourself, what is the endgame for a ministry of truth?
[00:06:52.972 --> 00:06:53.612]  No, don't do that.
[00:06:53.652 --> 00:06:54.773]  Your door's being kicked in.
[00:06:55.133 --> 00:06:56.234]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.191]  We'll be back for this live Tuesday edition.
[00:07:02.332 --> 00:07:02.832]  Stay with us.
[00:07:06.814 --> 00:07:12.198]  Here we are, my friends, on this Tuesday, May 10th, worldwide broadcast.
[00:07:13.138 --> 00:07:14.139]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:07:14.179 --> 00:07:15.760]  Very honored to be here with you again today.
[00:07:17.386 --> 00:07:22.548]  And I'm going to open the phones up throughout the full transmission until the fourth hour.
[00:07:22.568 --> 00:07:28.071]  So the next three hours will be open phones yet again on any subject or any topic you want to raise.
[00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:40.156]  Though specifically, I'd like to try to keep it to news topics if we could, and not so much an InfoWars-centric calls where we just talk about InfoWars.
[00:07:40.876 --> 00:07:54.363]  That's great for callers and great for folks that are really super fans, but we have a lot of people tuning in on AM and FM stations across the country that want to hear the news and the information and not just talk about the inner workings of InfoWars.
[00:07:54.383 --> 00:08:03.327]  But if you have questions, if you have comments, if you disagree, you agree, you want to give your view on something, it will be a free-for-all.
[00:08:03.887 --> 00:08:10.623]   I'm just telling you What my preference is when you call in that it be on one of the subjects, and that'd be great.
[00:08:11.063 --> 00:08:13.264]  Let me get into some of the subjects we've got here.
[00:08:13.725 --> 00:08:21.429]  Obviously the abortion topic going into overdrive right now with the left intensifying their bullying and terror campaigns.
[00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:27.953]  We have giant escalations by Biden now with $40 billion more to Ukraine.
[00:08:28.073 --> 00:08:30.835]  Biden speeds up military aid to Ukraine, drawing U.S.
[00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:32.316]  deeper into war.
[00:08:32.436 --> 00:08:35.098]  New York Times headline is actually accurate.
[00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:48.406]  Vladimir Putin gave an incredible World War II Victory Day speech, and by saying incredible, it was incredibly thought-provoking, the things he was saying, and incredibly dangerous as well.
[00:08:48.446 --> 00:09:00.096]  We've got some clips of that coming up, where he said the West has been taken over by a bunch of satanic demons, and the cancel culture is the new authoritarian 1984 system.
[00:09:00.336 --> 00:09:14.302]   It's just wild to see an authoritarian state Able to criticize the United States because we've become more authoritarian and more evil when it comes to the pedophilia, the sexualization of children than they have ever been.
[00:09:15.562 --> 00:09:18.663]  We've really lost the moral high ground.
[00:09:18.803 --> 00:09:19.863]  It's frightening.
[00:09:20.663 --> 00:09:21.844]  We have all that information.
[00:09:23.584 --> 00:09:28.165]  The first big story I want to hit, I'll cover it next segment, but I want to just point out this.
[00:09:28.265 --> 00:09:31.406]  I think it's the biggest story and then we'll detail it next segment.
[00:09:31.426 --> 00:09:33.246]  I'm going to move on to some of the other reports here in a moment.
[00:09:34.236 --> 00:09:44.876]   is, Psaki and Biden are now trying to blame conservatives and Trump and Republicans for
[00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:47.396]  the inflation and the gas prices.
[00:09:47.396 --> 00:09:52.317]   When, yeah, you can blame Republicans some for going along with overspending and printing
[00:09:52.317 --> 00:09:58.876]   over the years, but under the Democrats, they put the pedal to the metal and then cut off
[00:09:58.876 --> 00:10:00.876]  the energy supplies and the pipelines.
[00:10:01.561 --> 00:10:10.185]  So they're trying to do it on purpose as their Club of Rome globalist policy of a post-industrial world of controlled collapse.
[00:10:10.906 --> 00:10:19.610]  So it's simply astounding to watch the economy go up in flames and massive shortages of everything from gasoline to baby formula.
[00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:28.842]  Food distribution centers and food processing plants blowing up and burning on a daily basis.
[00:10:29.823 --> 00:10:31.164]  The border completely wide open.
[00:10:31.324 --> 00:10:36.667]  Images of hundreds of thousands, tens of thousands at a time flooding into the southern border.
[00:10:38.148 --> 00:10:40.369]  We'd cover it three, four years ago, it was big news.
[00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:49.654]  Now it's just, oh yeah, the border's completely wide open and the third world is collapsing under the weight of two years of lockdown into us.
[00:10:52.805 --> 00:10:56.747]  America is being turned into Venezuela, both literally and figuratively.
[00:10:58.247 --> 00:11:02.849]  And it's all part of a larger loveless plan, they admit.
[00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:05.330]  So that's coming up.
[00:11:06.831 --> 00:11:09.212]  And then we've got incredible tidbits like this.
[00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:16.510]   And I remember warning you about the fact that a lot of top globalists were involved
[00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:22.672]  in Ancestry.com and the other big DNA harvesting company.
[00:11:22.672 --> 00:11:29.711]   And I told you it was being sold to the Chinese because big tech has no regard for the law,
[00:11:29.711 --> 00:11:31.110]  anything, they do whatever they want.
[00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.110]  They're the deep state.
[00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.072]  They just have a blank check.
[00:11:34.072 --> 00:11:40.192]   And at the top of the pyramid, propping up China and the whole global system is the consortium
[00:11:40.192 --> 00:11:43.630]  of private banks that own BlackRock and Vanguard.
[00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:50.391]   Well now Blackstone to acquire Ancestry.com for $4.7 million and ownership of your DNA.
[00:11:50.373 --> 00:11:50.913]  Suckas.
[00:11:51.894 --> 00:11:53.014]  And I'm not calling you a sucker.
[00:11:54.175 --> 00:11:54.515]  They are.
[00:11:54.535 --> 00:11:55.755]  And you say, well what do I have to hide?
[00:11:55.795 --> 00:12:02.098]  Well no, now they'll patent your DNA and later claim they own it when you try to get any type of gene therapy.
[00:12:03.879 --> 00:12:08.352]   So they're mapping out the whole future Right now.
[00:12:08.432 --> 00:12:13.494]  Yeah, 23andMe has sold the rights to develop a drug based on its users' DNA.
[00:12:14.394 --> 00:12:17.895]  The Supreme Court's rule that when you give up samples and things, you don't own it.
[00:12:18.335 --> 00:12:19.655]  Because you don't stand up for yourself.
[00:12:19.675 --> 00:12:23.836]  So this is all a giant harvesting power grab.
[00:12:25.617 --> 00:12:30.178]  We also have, speak of the devil, the COVID stack is incredible.
[00:12:31.158 --> 00:12:32.719]  It just gets more insane by the day.
[00:12:33.699 --> 00:12:43.209]   Stephen Colbert has had four shots And he's had COVID three times, twice in the last month.
[00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:51.016]  You see, the more boosters old Steven gets, the sicker he gets, and all the studies actually show it gives you COVID.
[00:12:51.556 --> 00:12:53.298]  And old Steven ain't looking so good.
[00:12:53.919 --> 00:12:54.819]  He's aged a lot.
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:04.048]  Some of all of us under this bio attack, whether you get it naturally or from the shot, but all the studies show that a third or fourth shot, man, you are not going to be doing too hot.
[00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:12.020]  And there's other big studies out proving massive increases in heart attacks and strokes in people that have had the shots.
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:32.884]  Whether it's J&J, AstraZeneca, Moderna or Pfizer, they were all told by the working group run by Daszak and Gates and Fauci, months before they announced that COVID was released, it's in the emails, here's the sequence, here's the virus, start making a vaccine for this.
[00:13:33.585 --> 00:13:35.305]  And that's how they go, oh my gosh!
[00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.872]  Pfizer said, one week after we got the sample, we already had the vaccine.
[00:13:41.152 --> 00:13:41.892]  Yeah, right.
[00:13:43.153 --> 00:13:43.893]  Right, sure.
[00:13:45.053 --> 00:13:47.394]  Which again, creates the spike protein in your body.
[00:13:48.235 --> 00:13:50.296]  Orders your body to create what is killing you.
[00:13:51.616 --> 00:13:53.097]  Unbelievable.
[00:13:53.157 --> 00:13:58.659]  And yeah, it orders your body to create it, so your body recognizes it and fights it, and then causes an autoimmune response as well.
[00:14:00.657 --> 00:14:01.297]  So there you go.
[00:14:01.377 --> 00:14:12.780]  You talk about useful idiots marching themselves off the edge of a cliff and the Club of Rome that was a public arm of the Bilderberg Group and now the Davos Group has taken over for it.
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:27.843]  We have the head of the organization in just a short clip we'll be playing in the fourth segment, about 15-20 minutes, where he admits, yeah, we're going to cut the resources off and hopefully you peacefully just roll over and die.
[00:14:30.049 --> 00:14:34.390]  That's what's so frustrating is, we cover what the actual controllers are saying.
[00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:41.112]  When Schwab and Harari are saying, you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you have no free will, you have no freedom, we're gonna kill you.
[00:14:41.732 --> 00:14:43.133]  We are gods, we are gods.
[00:14:43.153 --> 00:14:51.875]  And they're like weird, crazy-looking, chicken-neck, pencil-neck, bug-eyed nuts, who just toddle around on stage announcing they're god.
[00:14:53.455 --> 00:15:00.440]   So if you want to hear from these folks, We will let you hear from them here today.
[00:15:01.181 --> 00:15:08.304]  They busted another big Republican slash Democrat operative trying to have sex with an underage girl under 12.
[00:15:09.304 --> 00:15:11.685]  He's a big buddy with the Clintons and Jeffrey Epstein, of course.
[00:15:13.466 --> 00:15:17.127]  We have just got so much to obviously hit here today.
[00:15:17.627 --> 00:15:18.428]  Please don't forget.
[00:15:19.719 --> 00:15:26.045]  Only way we reach new people under the massive censorship is when you remember to say, hey, you know the Forbidden Show?
[00:15:26.065 --> 00:15:29.568]  The thing you're not supposed to hear that warned about so much that's unfolded?
[00:15:29.908 --> 00:15:31.990]  Well, he's covering what's coming next and how to stop it.
[00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:44.501]   We need to tune into it, need to research it, need to prove it for yourself, need to do your own research, and then need to share it with others and tell them to do the same and tell them to do the same and create The Pay It Forward Chain Reaction.
[00:15:44.841 --> 00:15:50.044]  So please tell everybody about InfoWars.com forward slash show, ban.video.
[00:15:50.104 --> 00:16:02.091]  It's hard to share those URLs on many platforms, so do it on your text message, do it on your email, do it by word of mouth, or also the URLs we have that are backups that will index and take you right to the site and get past the sensors.
[00:16:02.111 --> 00:16:06.013]  The current site they're not blocking is BattlePlan.News.
[00:16:06.793 --> 00:16:08.274]  BattlePlan.News.
[00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:09.055]  Oh, and one more thing.
[00:16:09.955 --> 00:16:13.937]  X2 is going to sell out very soon, but it's 40% off with Ultra 12.
[00:16:14.058 --> 00:16:17.820]  It's now back in stock when you get them together and Ultra 12 is back in stock.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.320]  It's amazing.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.481]  It's 40% off as well for a limited time.
[00:16:20.501 --> 00:16:21.202]  Thank you for your support.
[00:16:22.963 --> 00:16:25.024]  And the answer to 1984 is definitely 1776.
[00:16:26.745 --> 00:16:33.149]  So it's good to know your enemy and it's good to know where their mindset and their systems of thought come from.
[00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:50.356]  And so let's do some of that here together today and understand why they're incrementally turning off the infrastructure, why they're incrementally dumbing down the population, why they're by degree poisoning us and dividing and conquering us.
[00:16:50.416 --> 00:17:02.101]  And that's because it's a pretext for them to get total control and power to claim the earth has reached its carrying capacity and there are too many people.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:19.091]  And so they've got to bring in a world dictatorship, and I'm about to play you them saying that, at the World Economic Forum, to save the Earth from the humans and have a peaceful extermination of at least 90% of the world population.
[00:17:21.141 --> 00:17:25.704]  Now Dennis Meadows, Paul Ehrlich, and John P. Holdren all wrote books.
[00:17:26.305 --> 00:17:31.669]  Some of them they co-authored like Limits to Growth and The Population Bomb back in the 60s.
[00:17:31.689 --> 00:17:35.271]  They were all funded by the Club of Rome and the Bilderberg Group on record.
[00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:39.194]  And he's a World Economic Forum fellow.
[00:17:39.655 --> 00:17:40.595]  He's been on the board.
[00:17:41.856 --> 00:17:48.862]  And he's a big professor here in the United States at MIT and other facilities.
[00:17:50.051 --> 00:17:55.993]  And here he is talking about a dictatorship to exterminate you and your family.
[00:17:59.195 --> 00:18:10.479]  This is not, this is not some minority of these people that are saying this and that are talking like this.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:19.847]   This is the entire mindset These people this is their worldview. This is their
[00:18:19.847 --> 00:18:27.258]   religion. This is what they are. This is who they are and it's their mission and
[00:18:27.258 --> 00:18:31.697]   Really it's the excuse for their power and control now you can have a debate
[00:18:31.697 --> 00:18:38.317]   About whether the earth is overpopulated and certainly in some areas it is and certainly society's broken down and
[00:18:38.317 --> 00:18:44.497]   humanity's lost its way But the idea that we're gonna let the very worst greedy out-of-control
[00:18:44.497 --> 00:18:48.697]   people that follow none of their own advice and
[00:18:48.697 --> 00:18:50.697]  Who are super predators?
[00:18:50.697 --> 00:18:55.607]   Sell us on Exterminating 90% of our fellow humans, you know, they're
[00:18:55.607 --> 00:19:06.657]   not gonna stop with them [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:18:57.894 --> 00:19:08.459]  And in fact, when you get deeper into their teachings and in their mindsets, they actually say, we're getting rid of all humans, we're gods, we're merging with machines.
[00:19:09.659 --> 00:19:18.174]  And the people that go to these events and get recruited into it, who then get pushed for Governor, Prime Minister, Congress, Parliament.
[00:19:19.195 --> 00:19:28.363]  They're let in on, you're the ruling elite, you have the high test scores, you've got good genetics, we say, you're a sociopath, and so now you're part of the club.
[00:19:29.144 --> 00:19:41.114]  And then they carry out the eugenics, and the sterilization, and the racial division, and the deindustrialization, and the attack on everybody else, so that we will peacefully, in quotes, disintegrate and fall apart.
[00:19:42.435 --> 00:20:07.310]   You can go back to Sir Thomas Malthus, 300 years ago, And he wrote books and scientific papers predicting by 1800 a total collapse of the planet's carrying capacity if they didn't kill the poor people by poisoning their food and by hurting them into tiny compact apartments where they would all get each other sick and die from not getting sunlight.
[00:20:09.711 --> 00:20:20.133]   And he himself was picking a lot of this up from Plato that talked about similar things.
[00:20:20.173 --> 00:20:25.837]  So people need to know the governing system that is attacking them and that is coming after them.
[00:20:25.898 --> 00:20:28.940]  So here is Club of Rome member.
[00:20:30.902 --> 00:20:33.404]  Here is Bilderberg Group attendee.
[00:20:33.985 --> 00:20:44.634]  Here is World Economic Forum fellow Dennis Meadows very calmly, psychotically talking about exterminating the majority of the public.
[00:20:46.195 --> 00:20:53.038]  And putting out the false idea that we must destroy humanity.
[00:20:53.258 --> 00:20:56.040]  But of course he's been self-appointed to carry that out.
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.320]  He's not going to go anywhere.
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:57.961]  Here it is.
[00:20:58.901 --> 00:21:08.505]  So far, globally, you are so far above the population and the consumption levels which can be supported by this planet that I know in one way or another it's going to come back down.
[00:21:08.546 --> 00:21:10.446]  So I don't hope to avoid that.
[00:21:12.808 --> 00:21:20.321]   I hope That it can occur in a civil way.
[00:21:21.261 --> 00:21:25.742]  And I mean civil in a special way.
[00:21:26.262 --> 00:21:26.703]  Peaceful.
[00:21:27.623 --> 00:21:40.305]  Peace doesn't mean that everybody's happy, but it means that conflict isn't solved through violence, through force, but rather in other ways.
[00:21:40.505 --> 00:21:42.086]  And so that's what I hope for.
[00:21:44.759 --> 00:21:54.682]  That we can, I mean, the planet can support something like a billion people.
[00:21:56.983 --> 00:22:02.925]  Maybe two billion, depending on how much liberty and how much material consumption you want to have.
[00:22:02.945 --> 00:22:08.546]  If you want more liberty and more consumption, you have to have fewer people.
[00:22:09.167 --> 00:22:19.715]   And conversely, if you have more people, I mean, we could even have Eight or nine billion, probably, if we have a very strong dictatorship, which is smart.
[00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:22.677]  Unfortunately, you never have smart dictatorships.
[00:22:22.697 --> 00:22:23.438]  They're always stupid.
[00:22:23.978 --> 00:22:28.082]  But if you had a smart dictatorship and a low standard of living, you could have it.
[00:22:28.582 --> 00:22:32.885]  But we want to have freedom and we want to have a high sentence, so we're going to have a billion people.
[00:22:33.326 --> 00:22:35.808]  And we're now at seven, so we have to get back down.
[00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:53.721]  I hope that this can be slow, relatively slow, and that it can be done in a way which is relatively equal, you know, so that people share the experience and you don't have a few rich, you know, trying to force everybody else to deal with it.
[00:22:53.821 --> 00:22:54.722]  So those are my hopes.
[00:22:54.782 --> 00:23:06.483]   I mean, these are pretty pessimistic hopes, you know, but that's So that's the standard operating procedure of these people.
[00:23:06.544 --> 00:23:13.965]  They run the planet, and they're cutting off resources and cutting off clean innovations because they really just want to be able to play God.
[00:23:16.825 --> 00:23:26.547]  And they're targeting the smartest and most informed people we've got with the fluoride, with the atrazine, with all the chemicals, because they don't want competition.
[00:23:26.587 --> 00:23:28.748]  These are the worst of the worst.
[00:23:28.808 --> 00:23:30.988]  And you heard what he said in that little short two-minute clip.
[00:23:32.608 --> 00:23:35.251]  He said we need to depopulate them peacefully.
[00:23:36.413 --> 00:23:39.576]  He goes, I don't mean there won't be death and violence.
[00:23:39.636 --> 00:23:41.719]  No, I mean, where there's not big conflict.
[00:23:42.019 --> 00:24:00.038]   They don't want governments figuring this out or a country or a group saying we don't want to be killed and not going along with it because everybody will notice they're not going to be dying slowly from the chemicals and the shots and the The 5G, countries that don't do this, so you've got to make sure everybody goes along, and then he said, then there are ways to peacefully depopulate.
[00:24:00.418 --> 00:24:10.747]  Through the food, through the water, through the shots, electromagnetically, and that's what they talk about, hitting you with a cocktail of attacks, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly what's killing.
[00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:19.194]  They need to get the population down so they can keep those that are left in Plato's cave.
[00:24:20.353 --> 00:24:25.490]  Or they can project their reality on the wall, and then you simply accept it.
[00:24:27.321 --> 00:24:33.044]  Very, very frustrating to see them in countless clips every day coming out of their rat holes, talking about how they're going to kill everybody.
[00:24:33.744 --> 00:24:36.265]  And then you can open the New York Times up, and Jones is dangerous.
[00:24:36.285 --> 00:24:38.727]  He claims there's a global plot to depopulate the Earth.
[00:24:39.087 --> 00:24:43.629]  And the next page in the New York Times says, it's time to start censoring and depopulating.
[00:24:43.969 --> 00:24:45.850]  And the end of humanity is a needed thing.
[00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:50.012]  But everyone that's going along with this is pretending they won't be destroyed as well.
[00:24:50.352 --> 00:24:50.833]  Stay with us.
[00:24:51.793 --> 00:24:56.295]  Coming up next segment, I'm going to get into the fraud that is COVID-19 and what it really is.
[00:24:56.835 --> 00:25:07.019]  A synthetic replicating nanotech cooked up in a lab by scientists working directly for Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:17.803]  And so when you get sick from it, when your family gets sick and dies from it, just remember, they told you there's too many of us and they're going to kill all of us if we buy into it.
[00:25:17.823 --> 00:25:18.523]  Because here's the deal.
[00:25:18.903 --> 00:25:20.164]  They're beta testing with COVID-19.
[00:25:22.179 --> 00:25:25.140]  That's mother's milk compared to what they've got on the shelf.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:36.364]  And if they think they can get away with launching something much bigger and much worse, and you'll stay locked down and die at home, and that things won't get out of control and they won't get blamed, they will wipe you out.
[00:25:37.564 --> 00:25:50.729]  I've been on air 28 years, and for 28 years I've been saying a controlled bioweapon release is coming, but first they would have limited releases to practice lockdowns of the control grid, because that's just common sense is how they do it.
[00:25:52.597 --> 00:25:54.598]  And we've got their white papers where they talk about it.
[00:25:55.698 --> 00:25:59.660]  But before we even got their white papers, I had analyzed and reverse-engineered their plan.
[00:26:01.501 --> 00:26:02.341]  Anybody can do this.
[00:26:02.381 --> 00:26:12.645]  They're rich, they've stolen the world, they're all gonna go to jail for the fiat currencies and garbage they've engaged in, they make Bernie Madoff look like a choir boy, and instead they got a plan to kill us!
[00:26:13.366 --> 00:26:15.747]  And they think we're so dumb we won't figure it out and stop them!
[00:26:18.148 --> 00:26:18.648]  And you know what?
[00:26:20.615 --> 00:26:22.036]  If we don't stop them, we deserve it.
[00:26:22.216 --> 00:26:24.037]  And that's kind of the game they're playing.
[00:26:25.597 --> 00:26:26.218]  They're evil.
[00:26:26.258 --> 00:26:27.178]  What they're doing is wrong.
[00:26:27.378 --> 00:26:28.439]  I will not join with them.
[00:26:28.939 --> 00:26:37.503]  But it is very frustrating to be talking about something that is 100% on record that we are now leaving beta and entering operational.
[00:26:39.444 --> 00:26:43.046]  Most of you listening will be dead within eight years under their plan.
[00:26:43.606 --> 00:26:44.626]  Comprende?
[00:26:45.227 --> 00:26:47.167]  Do you comprehend what I'm saying to you?
[00:26:48.408 --> 00:26:50.149]  This is not a damn game.
[00:26:52.728 --> 00:27:00.132]  And if you ask why they want me shut off more than anybody, it's because we are 100% over the target.
[00:27:01.813 --> 00:27:04.274]  I could play you just new clips I saw the last two days.
[00:27:05.134 --> 00:27:10.297]  I've got more than 15 clips of world leaders calling for depopulation and world dictatorship.
[00:27:11.522 --> 00:27:21.514]  Since I showed you five headlines last week, out of Financial Times, Bloomberg, New York Times, you name it, calling for dictatorship, there's more articles calling for dictatorship.
[00:27:22.234 --> 00:27:23.936]  The bad guys call for killing people.
[00:27:24.237 --> 00:27:26.339]  The bad guys call for cutting the resources off.
[00:27:26.599 --> 00:27:28.602]  The bad guys call for depopulation.
[00:27:28.862 --> 00:27:31.045]  The bad guys are in control.
[00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:36.315]  And it doesn't mean it's our whole government.
[00:27:36.435 --> 00:27:37.876]  They have hijacked our government.
[00:27:38.357 --> 00:27:48.787]  If a hijacker takes over a plane with a hand grenade and a gun, you don't start stabbing the windows out and attacking the control panel of the plane and trying to open the side hatch.
[00:27:50.589 --> 00:27:53.272]  You remove the hijacker.
[00:27:54.393 --> 00:27:58.017]  But they want to stab a civil war and destroy the airplane we're flying on here.
[00:28:00.674 --> 00:28:06.878]  That's really what America is, is a floating continent on top of lava, on a giant planetoid hurtling through space, around its sun.
[00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:27.993]  But the point is, is that the analogy, we're on an airplane with the hijackers, and they're wearing the uniform of the captain, the captain's tied up behind him, and then after a while the hijacker starts bragging, yeah, I'm not really the captain, yeah, I took over the thing, you're not going to do anything, and he's sitting there picking his teeth with a toothpick all arrogantly, and he says to people on board the plane, who wants to join me?
[00:28:28.253 --> 00:28:29.814]  We're taking this plane to Cuba.
[00:28:32.776 --> 00:28:39.981]  And in modern America, a lot of women might start taking their clothes off and dancing saying, yeah, I got Stockholm Syndrome, I really like you, I want to be with you.
[00:28:41.522 --> 00:28:43.844]  That's what people are like that are going along with this.
[00:28:43.964 --> 00:28:50.108]  It's ridiculous, it's stupid, and it's destructive, and it will bring us down.
[00:28:51.729 --> 00:29:03.737]   And speaking of that, I mean, the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve, Has been devaluing the dollar since they started the takeover over 100 years ago in 1913.
[00:29:04.418 --> 00:29:07.239]  108, nine years ago, whatever it is now.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:08.680]  109 years ago.
[00:29:12.141 --> 00:29:21.106]  But more than half that devaluation happened between the 1970s and the end of the Trump administration.
[00:29:22.034 --> 00:29:24.155]  And Trump was part of this, and one of the bad things he did.
[00:29:24.716 --> 00:29:31.620]  But at that point, inflation was here, and he was trying to get us out of a recession, and try to bring the jobs back, but it still wasn't perfect.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:47.089]  Under Biden, he puts all the regulations back on to shut down the jobs, to shut down the pipelines, to shut down the gas drilling, the oil drilling, everything you do to put a country into cardiac arrest, while opening the borders, while handing out more welfare, while doubling spending.
[00:29:48.959 --> 00:29:51.180]  And then start shipping trillions more in U.S.
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:59.644]  dollars around the world, and then they say, we don't know why there's inflation.
[00:30:00.484 --> 00:30:02.145]  Now remember what I said when he first got in.
[00:30:02.205 --> 00:30:04.026]  I said, his policies are getting accelerated.
[00:30:04.526 --> 00:30:18.162]   So there was more money issued and more currency put out in the first year of Biden, this was mainstream news, than there was in the whole history Of the United States.
[00:30:18.522 --> 00:30:23.522]   Trump, Obama, Bush, Clinton, right back to George Washington.
[00:30:23.522 --> 00:30:30.522]  Now you think about that.
[00:30:31.365 --> 00:30:33.667]  And so remember a year ago, they said there is no inflation.
[00:30:34.027 --> 00:30:35.929]  Then they said, well, a little inflation is good.
[00:30:36.309 --> 00:30:38.491]  Then they said, well, it's only in certain areas.
[00:30:38.571 --> 00:30:45.837]  Well, now Biden says he's taking inflation, that's the quote, very, very seriously.
[00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:48.619]  And then he goes on to blame the Republicans.
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.162]  And he says they're not taking it seriously.
[00:30:52.362 --> 00:30:53.984]  Do you really want to hear him bumbling and babbling?
[00:30:54.244 --> 00:30:55.345]  There's the video on screen.
[00:30:55.725 --> 00:30:59.969]  Biden, the number one threat is the strength and the strength that we are built on.
[00:31:01.341 --> 00:31:02.005]  Is inflation.
[00:31:04.298 --> 00:31:05.379]  Get that clip ready, actually.
[00:31:05.399 --> 00:31:06.159]  That's another clip.
[00:31:06.199 --> 00:31:10.862]  I've got the clip right here where he says inflation is important and he blames the Republicans.
[00:31:13.024 --> 00:31:14.425]  I mean, yeah, they're playing second fiddle.
[00:31:14.445 --> 00:31:19.788]  I guess they're to blame partly too, but you're like the one that put it into overdrive here with all your policies.
[00:31:20.208 --> 00:31:22.170]  And now I'd read that quote this morning.
[00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:25.552]  I didn't know it was an actual video of it, of him saying our strength is inflation.
[00:31:26.312 --> 00:31:31.015]  Yeah, that's the globalist strength because they use the money first to buy up all the infrastructure and then hand us what?
[00:31:31.175 --> 00:31:33.057]  The debt and the devaluation.
[00:31:33.999 --> 00:31:44.342]  I mean folks, you always hear about places like Mexico and Venezuela or Zimbabwe or Weimar Germany that devalue their currencies and how horrible it was and how criminal their governments were.
[00:31:44.362 --> 00:31:47.983]  That's been done.
[00:31:48.003 --> 00:31:54.905]  It'd be like if I walked up and I had this dagger in my hand and I just stabbed you right in the heart.
[00:31:57.845 --> 00:31:59.586]  It'd take you a minute or two to probably die.
[00:32:00.831 --> 00:32:01.851]  Maybe longer if you're tough.
[00:32:02.232 --> 00:32:03.592]  Maybe if I didn't really hit you in the right spot.
[00:32:04.153 --> 00:32:05.533]  So I'd go ahead and stab you a couple more times.
[00:32:05.893 --> 00:32:06.854]  But we've been stabbed.
[00:32:07.274 --> 00:32:07.854]  Okay?
[00:32:08.375 --> 00:32:10.055]  I mean, we've been stabbed really bad.
[00:32:10.195 --> 00:32:10.516]  Okay?
[00:32:10.876 --> 00:32:15.278]  And so, everybody just needs to understand, again, there's no stopping it now.
[00:32:15.818 --> 00:32:18.499]  We really tried to stop the New World Order getting to this point.
[00:32:18.739 --> 00:32:22.001]  But they've now put the pig in the oven.
[00:32:24.107 --> 00:32:25.829]  They now let the cows out of the barn.
[00:32:25.889 --> 00:32:27.290]  They pulled the trigger, baby.
[00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:28.891]  They opened Pandora's box.
[00:32:29.272 --> 00:32:30.052]  We let them do it.
[00:32:30.633 --> 00:32:34.256]  And we are in deep trouble.
[00:32:35.737 --> 00:32:39.521]  And I say that because, again, what is Biden's controllers having him do?
[00:32:40.562 --> 00:32:47.048]  If they can blame the populist and the Republicans and people that were against this for what they've done, they win.
[00:32:47.428 --> 00:32:54.294]   If the globalists can blame Biden for all the horrible things, that are happening and just blame Biden, they'll love that
[00:32:54.294 --> 00:32:58.903]   too. That's why he's seen all the new he is, so he'll take the blame. But if we blame the
[00:32:58.903 --> 00:33:05.014]   permanent deep state, if we blame the globalists, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Council on Foreign
[00:33:05.014 --> 00:33:09.784]   Relations, the Deimos Group, the Black Rock, and all the people that sit there and abuse us, that
[00:33:09.784 --> 00:33:15.004]   own these puppets, that run these attacks against us, that set the global lockdown policy, that are
[00:33:15.004 --> 00:33:21.472]   pushing the World ID and the forced injections, if we start addressing them instead of their
[00:33:21.472 --> 00:33:23.524]  puppets, it's game over.
[00:33:23.665 --> 00:33:29.106]  Their whole system rests on Rand Paul attacking Biden.
[00:33:30.366 --> 00:33:33.607]  And Josh Hawley attacking Biden.
[00:33:33.667 --> 00:33:38.128]  And you earn points, and he's an idiot, and all the Republicans are going to win this big sweep.
[00:33:39.809 --> 00:33:49.671]   But if you don't address the root of it, and just heads of the Hydra, You can cut those heads off all day long, and the hydra just gets stronger.
[00:33:49.691 --> 00:33:55.537]  Because while you're busy cutting one head off, it's eating your lunch and stomping you to death.
[00:33:58.139 --> 00:34:00.441]  So I just keep harping and harping and harping.
[00:34:00.521 --> 00:34:01.742]  Why do they hate me, number one?
[00:34:02.563 --> 00:34:04.125]  Because I identify them.
[00:34:07.037 --> 00:34:13.779]  And once the globalists are identified in their criminal system, they all go to prison and this stuff stops and humanity's got a new lease on life.
[00:34:14.359 --> 00:34:18.681]  We'll be right back with these clips on Psaki saying, well, wait till you see what she had to say about inflation.
[00:34:19.401 --> 00:34:22.202]  I'm going to say it again and then I'm going to cover the news of what they're doing to us.
[00:34:24.683 --> 00:34:31.805]  I have made it my adult life to expose the globalist shadow government while it was building its operation in quasi-secrecy.
[00:34:32.665 --> 00:34:34.886]  I have traveled the world to expose their secret meetings.
[00:34:35.936 --> 00:34:49.461]  I have been arrested, I have been sued, I have been persecuted because I knew that we had to stop them and I believed in you that once they went operational and we failed to stop them you would then beat them because you would understand their plan.
[00:34:52.202 --> 00:35:04.467]  I knew our credibility would explode and erupt like a volcano once we exposed the New World Order and once they launched their operation.
[00:35:07.014 --> 00:35:12.517]  And we are now inside that new world order.
[00:35:13.898 --> 00:35:17.039]  We are now fighting for our lives.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.540]  We know they are evil.
[00:35:19.821 --> 00:35:22.863]  We know their plans for us are evil.
[00:35:24.463 --> 00:35:44.147]   And now we have to make the choice whether we want to be slaves and turn our children over to a fate worse than death, We want to stand up together and erase color and creed with dignity and honor and not comply with the globalists in any way.
[00:35:46.409 --> 00:35:51.912]  They are using the most classic form of economic warfare to bring us under their control.
[00:35:54.534 --> 00:36:00.838]  Here is Biden saying that inflation is our strength.
[00:36:02.938 --> 00:36:06.382]  I've built a strong, we've built a strong economy with a strong job market.
[00:36:07.203 --> 00:36:17.233]  And I agree with what Chairman Powell said last week, that the number one threat is the strength, and that strength that we build is inflation.
[00:36:18.255 --> 00:36:22.419]  So the Fed should do its job, and it will do its job, I'm convinced, with that in mind.
[00:36:22.439 --> 00:36:24.621]  Alright.
[00:36:26.127 --> 00:36:35.710]  My administration escalates war with Russia as Democrat abortion campaign heats up and as they devalue our dollar on our path to total and complete slavery.
[00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:53.220]   Here's Jen Psaki, let's just play it back-to-back, her saying she doesn't think anyone could have predicted a year ago that inflation would soar to record highs and then she says that Government policies have not led to inflation.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.361]  Well, it's kind of true.
[00:36:55.202 --> 00:36:59.345]  The Federal Reserve's private run for profit, but sets policy with the government.
[00:37:00.106 --> 00:37:01.908]  So here she is gaslighting the public.
[00:37:02.466 --> 00:37:13.055]  No, if we look at the recent inflation data, depending on which data you look at, two-thirds to even 70% of inflation data is a result of energy prices.
[00:37:13.515 --> 00:37:27.566]  A large part of that is the result, and Chairman Powell has spoken to this, and Secretary Yellen has also spoken to this, as a result of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine and the impact on the global energy markets.
[00:37:27.927 --> 00:37:31.890]  Those are all steps and impacts that I don't think anyone could have predicted a year ago.
[00:37:33.666 --> 00:37:34.387]  Go ahead.
[00:37:34.567 --> 00:37:46.175]  As we look ahead to tomorrow's inflation speech, let me ask you to look back at some of the warnings that were issued last year by Summers and Ratner and so on.
[00:37:46.315 --> 00:37:51.679]  In retrospect, were they right that some of the government policies were going to lead to inflation?
[00:37:53.169 --> 00:37:56.110]  I wouldn't say we agreed with them then and we don't agree with them now.
[00:37:56.130 --> 00:38:09.793]  I would note that as it relates to actions like the American Rescue Plan, the alternative to not putting in place and advocating for the American Rescue Plan would have been the economy continuing to spiral, right?
[00:38:10.213 --> 00:38:15.874]  We were providing assistance and relief in the form of checks to people who needed that assistance at the time.
[00:38:17.315 --> 00:38:31.342]  They launch the viral attack, they launch the lockdown that causes the collapse of the economy, they devalue the currency and they tell you they're saving you, when everything they want to do on record is enslave you by making you completely poor, the easiest way to control people.
[00:38:32.623 --> 00:38:39.406]  And yes, the war in Ukraine is the icing on the cake in prices increasing, but it's just that.
[00:38:42.659 --> 00:38:46.960]  The icing on the cake and the West started that war.
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:49.541]  Even the Pope now admits that.
[00:38:52.962 --> 00:38:53.562]  Unbelievable.
[00:38:55.623 --> 00:38:56.743]  Absolutely unbelievable.
[00:38:56.763 --> 00:38:58.484]  Let's look at some of these headlines.
[00:38:59.584 --> 00:39:00.224]  Fact check!
[00:39:00.284 --> 00:39:03.065]  Did nobody predict inflation as Psaki claims?
[00:39:03.465 --> 00:39:06.266]  A good town hall article showing a whole bunch of people predicting it.
[00:39:06.566 --> 00:39:09.887]  Hell, it was already bad inflation when he got in and now it just exploded.
[00:39:11.047 --> 00:39:15.129]  Biden's economy markets fall more as S&P reaches 52-week low.
[00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.711]  Gas prices jump to fresh record highs.
[00:39:19.771 --> 00:39:20.751]  And remember, the key.
[00:39:22.392 --> 00:39:36.378]  She says it's Putin when he shut down over 2,000 major pipelines and sub-pipelines, won't give out permits to fix pipelines, shut down the Keystone Pipeline, and is now trying to shut down the main Canadian pipeline that supplies most of the damn Midwest.
[00:39:40.237 --> 00:39:42.619]  And then Governor Whitmer couldn't shut it down.
[00:39:43.479 --> 00:39:46.821]  And so Biden said, well, I'll just override our treaty with Canada.
[00:39:47.681 --> 00:39:49.843]  Why the hell would you shut our pipelines off?
[00:39:50.343 --> 00:39:56.426]  I mean, this is like you walk up to your neighbors sitting there shooting holes in your car's engine.
[00:39:56.867 --> 00:39:58.247]  And you go, why are you hurting my car?
[00:39:58.267 --> 00:39:59.368]  And they go, we're not hurting your car.
[00:39:59.388 --> 00:40:00.048]  We love you.
[00:40:00.449 --> 00:40:02.450]  Why Putin shot holes in the engine of your car?
[00:40:07.168 --> 00:40:12.529]  Meanwhile, baby formula shortages affect new parents with increasing prices and lack of availability.
[00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:15.170]  Waiting less to buy it online two months.
[00:40:17.971 --> 00:40:23.032]  Tech giants lost more than $1 trillion in value in the last three trading days.
[00:40:25.313 --> 00:40:27.153]  40% of Bitcoin investors are now underwater.
[00:40:27.493 --> 00:40:28.353]  New data shows.
[00:40:30.034 --> 00:40:31.514]  Spectator says crypto's dead.
[00:40:31.534 --> 00:40:33.795]  I don't agree with that, but it's going to go down for a while.
[00:40:36.015 --> 00:40:40.941]  But that's okay, because Joe Biden's got a next level brainwashing and inversion.
[00:40:41.542 --> 00:40:47.529]  Reuters reports Biden to blast Republicans as having no plan on inflation.
[00:40:47.949 --> 00:40:49.932]  His plan is more spending.
[00:40:52.495 --> 00:41:00.773]   And of course, 40 billion dollars, it was 38 billion a week ago, to be sent to Ukraine of taxpayer money.
[00:41:01.133 --> 00:41:06.258]  That's why you've got Club of Rome saying, I hope we can depopulate in a civil way.
[00:41:07.659 --> 00:41:19.660]   And that is what you're witnessing right now is the beginning of the long slide into oblivion and that is what we are fighting with every Speck of energy we've got.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:34.124]  All major infrastructures, but synthetic poison, whether it's crops, whether it's synthetic meat, whether it's synthetic milk, they're taking even the regular formula away, and they're gonna make you eat bugs, and make you drink sewage water, and make you like it.
[00:41:34.164 --> 00:41:35.084]  These are all quotes!
[00:41:35.524 --> 00:41:42.787]  You think they'd put out Davos Group videos, highly produced, saying, soon you'll have nothing, soon you'll eat bugs, and you're like, oh, I'm not gonna be eating bugs.
[00:41:43.047 --> 00:41:43.787]  Yeah, you are!
[00:41:44.747 --> 00:41:46.748]  Because you're gonna take it, because you like it!
[00:41:48.041 --> 00:41:52.124]  I don't mean our general audience, but the delusional leftists that go along with this.
[00:41:52.404 --> 00:41:56.547]  Bill Gates' back company says lab-produced breast milk is three to five years away.
[00:41:56.567 --> 00:42:02.392]  Now, next hour, I want to give the phone number out.
[00:42:02.412 --> 00:42:03.332]  I want to take your calls.
[00:42:03.412 --> 00:42:07.996]  I got a lot of other big abortion news, military news, Putin clips to play.
[00:42:08.076 --> 00:42:09.157]  So much, it's important.
[00:42:10.714 --> 00:42:23.498]  Coming up in this report, first when we start next hour, Blackstone, that's the top of the pyramid to acquire Ancestry.com and the ownership of your DNA for $4.7 billion.
[00:42:23.738 --> 00:42:26.458]  23andMe also says they're selling your DNA.
[00:42:27.179 --> 00:42:27.659]  There you go.
[00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:28.499]  I warned you about it.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:35.421]  That was an evil conspiracy terrorist, but that happened years ago.
[00:42:35.541 --> 00:42:38.722]  Now they're buying up more of the companies.
[00:42:41.511 --> 00:42:47.637]  Absolutely insane to have all this going on and all of this unfolding.
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:51.681]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:42:52.001 --> 00:42:53.883]  I just want to thank all the listeners for your support.
[00:42:54.758 --> 00:42:58.902]  We have been in the red the last few months with not even the money to be able to buy a future product to fund ourselves.
[00:42:59.622 --> 00:43:02.285]  We got a $2 million Bitcoin donation.
[00:43:02.405 --> 00:43:08.670]  I decided to put half of it into cash into the operating fund and wait and see what the other million, that other million is now like $700,000.
[00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:13.034]  I've decided to hold on to it and see what happens.
[00:43:13.074 --> 00:43:14.415]  But see, that's not even a surety.
[00:43:14.755 --> 00:43:16.997]  If that doesn't stay at a million, we're back in the red.
[00:43:17.157 --> 00:43:21.597]  example of why we need your support at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:43:26.086 --> 00:43:30.547]   stance against the new world order at this critical time, which is a must in my opinion,

[00:44:08.365 --> 00:44:09.485]  The fun part is your libido.
[00:44:09.865 --> 00:44:10.666]  And so much more.
[00:44:10.846 --> 00:44:13.788]  X2, back in stock exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:44:51.131 --> 00:44:59.718]  And most iodine that you get from different foods is bound to other minerals or other compounds, so it's not absorbable in the body.
[00:44:59.978 --> 00:45:01.999]  And that's why iodine deficiency is such a huge issue.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:06.903]  We have the purest, cleanest, best iodine in the world from deep-earth crystals more than 7,000 feet deep.
[00:45:08.744 --> 00:45:12.086]  X2 is an amazing product, and it has been sold out for months and months and months.
[00:45:12.466 --> 00:45:17.109]  It is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com for 25% off.
[00:45:17.489 --> 00:45:29.175]  Ladies and gentlemen, with all the supply chain breakdowns and the rest of it, I'm not sure when the next time we're going to get X2 is, so I would stock up on X2 right now at InfoWarsTore.com and know that you're fighting the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.

[00:45:44.095 --> 00:45:50.386]   Hanson, my old good friend who was working with me 27, 28 years ago on AXS TV, he's
[00:45:50.386 --> 00:45:55.055]   been going through and archiving all the old VHS tapes and dumping them to Band.Video
[00:45:55.055 --> 00:45:58.256]   on the Mike Hanson channels since his channel on YouTube got banned
[00:45:58.697 --> 00:46:00.779]  Even Alex Jones from 25 years ago is verboten!
[00:46:04.056 --> 00:46:10.841]  But one of the things I did, this has got to be like in 96, 97, was a character I did probably 10 times and only found one tape of it.
[00:46:11.281 --> 00:46:16.024]  It's Global Love Cop, a global UN cop, and here's a few minutes of it.
[00:46:16.044 --> 00:46:19.706]  The full thing is on the Mike Hanson Archives at Bandot Video.
[00:46:20.007 --> 00:46:20.367]  Here it is.
[00:46:20.387 --> 00:46:21.628]  We'll come back and cover a ton of news.
[00:46:22.068 --> 00:46:25.349]  We're glad to be here.
[00:46:25.669 --> 00:46:34.052]  We don't agree with Alex Jones and Jeff Davis and Bo.
[00:46:35.073 --> 00:46:36.413]  We like big government.
[00:46:36.453 --> 00:46:39.154]  We like multijurisdictional task forces.
[00:46:39.554 --> 00:46:40.915]  We like it.
[00:46:41.235 --> 00:46:44.036]  We're loving global love cops.
[00:46:44.176 --> 00:46:44.456]  That's right.
[00:46:44.476 --> 00:46:45.456]  We don't want people to disagree.
[00:46:45.476 --> 00:46:45.877]  That's good.
[00:46:47.297 --> 00:46:48.899]  So, uh, so what are your names?
[00:46:48.919 --> 00:46:53.484]  You're a special agent, uh... I am a multi-jurisdictional task force.
[00:46:53.524 --> 00:46:54.885]  Don't mind the ski mask.
[00:46:55.206 --> 00:46:57.328]  I'm here to protect you and your property.
[00:46:57.348 --> 00:46:58.068]  Yeah.
[00:46:58.089 --> 00:47:00.811]  Except when I decide to seize it without due process.
[00:47:00.871 --> 00:47:01.892]  Yeah.
[00:47:01.912 --> 00:47:03.094]  But I said forfeiture seizure.
[00:47:03.114 --> 00:47:04.615]  We're so loving.
[00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:05.857]  My name is Harold.
[00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:09.701]  And my name is William.
[00:47:09.821 --> 00:47:11.422]  And my name is Harold.
[00:47:11.462 --> 00:47:12.223]  Harold and William.
[00:47:12.403 --> 00:47:14.065]  Yes, and we're good.
[00:47:14.085 --> 00:47:17.329]  We're global love cops.
[00:47:17.369 --> 00:47:21.874]  We love the media says we're good.
[00:47:21.934 --> 00:47:22.714]  We are.
[00:47:23.035 --> 00:47:24.997]  The media likes us too.
[00:47:25.017 --> 00:47:26.458]  The media loves us.
[00:47:29.036 --> 00:47:33.079]  The media, the loving media, they're our friends, you know!
[00:47:34.019 --> 00:47:45.646]  Don't listen to Bo, I agree with those callers earlier that have no thoughts to think that the government training centers have indoctrinated all who are understanding young youth.
[00:47:45.746 --> 00:47:48.168]  They're like, what did Mr. Rockefeller, our boss, say?
[00:47:48.188 --> 00:48:02.830]   Yes, our boss once said that government training centers were helpless people yielding themselves to our Sometimes we gotta use force, but it's for their best interest.
[00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:05.332]  And that's why we support bills like H.R.
[00:48:05.352 --> 00:48:10.915]  1956 that allow further asset forfeiture laws.
[00:48:10.955 --> 00:48:13.016]  We like to seize property.
[00:48:13.096 --> 00:48:15.977]  If a neighbor doesn't give you up, we get to get their property too!
[00:48:19.119 --> 00:48:19.760]  Yes.
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.922]  Oh, everyone paddling on each other.
[00:48:22.122 --> 00:48:23.003]  We're global love.
[00:48:23.063 --> 00:48:26.788]  I think we got some footage of your friends at work.
[00:48:26.928 --> 00:48:27.869]  Oh, yes.
[00:48:27.909 --> 00:48:29.591]  This is Bill and Sam.
[00:48:29.871 --> 00:48:30.652]  We can bring that up.
[00:48:30.672 --> 00:48:31.613]  They're our friends.
[00:48:31.653 --> 00:48:33.755]  Yes, let's show what our friends are doing.
[00:48:33.775 --> 00:48:34.776]  Let's show them.
[00:48:34.897 --> 00:48:36.659]  Let's show the love.
[00:48:37.099 --> 00:48:39.600]  Do you want to hear from, uh, you want to see, take some calls?
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:40.361]  Oh, yes!
[00:48:40.661 --> 00:48:45.783]  Yeah, we can take calls, but we can also see the footage of our friends.
[00:48:46.284 --> 00:48:48.225]  They're in their... Yeah, that's on blue.
[00:48:48.325 --> 00:48:50.566]  ...in their love action.
[00:48:51.466 --> 00:48:52.427]  I like it!
[00:48:52.647 --> 00:48:55.088]  Well, while they're bringing that up... In fact, I love it!
[00:48:55.188 --> 00:48:58.030]  Oh, yes!
[00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:00.491]  Yes, the game is changing!
[00:49:01.963 --> 00:49:03.104]  We like what they do!
[00:49:03.325 --> 00:49:04.486]  Oh, we love dumbbells!
[00:49:04.586 --> 00:49:05.087]  Oh, we love them!
[00:49:05.287 --> 00:49:09.452]  Oh, we love what the government's done to you!
[00:49:09.272 --> 00:49:11.272]  what the government's done to you.
[00:49:11.272 --> 00:49:13.512]  (shouting)
[00:49:13.512 --> 00:49:15.772]  (laughing)
[00:49:15.772 --> 00:49:26.311]  They'll never stand up for private property.
[00:49:26.311 --> 00:49:27.672]  (shouting)
[00:49:27.621 --> 00:49:29.621]  They're too busy!
[00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:34.621]  We love you!
[00:49:34.621 --> 00:49:36.621]  We love you!
[00:49:36.621 --> 00:49:40.621]  Let's take another cut.
[00:49:40.512 --> 00:49:42.533]  Let's try to find someone serious.
[00:49:42.993 --> 00:49:46.955]  To seriously come up with the logical arguments against this kind of behavior.
[00:49:46.975 --> 00:49:48.336]  We love police states!
[00:49:49.296 --> 00:49:52.478]  We love no innocent until proven guilty!
[00:49:52.658 --> 00:49:54.399]  No innocent until proven guilty!
[00:49:54.439 --> 00:49:55.920]  We love smashing through doors!
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:56.600]  Yes, Connor!
[00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:58.541]  Uh, I just want to know one thing.
[00:49:58.861 --> 00:50:01.462]  What the hell kind of jury you guys are, you stupid asses?
[00:50:01.922 --> 00:50:02.943]  Oh, here's another!
[00:50:04.483 --> 00:50:07.704]  I like you!
[00:50:08.144 --> 00:50:10.445]  Here's another one that we love!
[00:50:10.465 --> 00:50:13.186]  He loves us too!
[00:50:14.606 --> 00:50:17.607]  We love you too!
[00:50:17.907 --> 00:50:19.547]  Oh, we love that attitude!
[00:50:19.587 --> 00:50:22.848]  You'll get nothing done that way!
[00:50:23.688 --> 00:50:24.509]  Well, you found it.
[00:50:24.569 --> 00:50:27.109]  The show they want off the air more than any other broadcast.
[00:50:27.129 --> 00:50:28.029]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.590]  I'm your host.
[00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.770]  Very honored to be here.
[00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:42.002]  All right, for the next two hours, we're going to be taking your phone calls, first-time callers, people who've never called before, first-time callers, people that are long-time callers, people that disagree, agree.
[00:50:42.122 --> 00:50:46.527]  All I ask is you have a clean telephone, and we get to your points, we get to the next person.
[00:50:46.547 --> 00:50:48.809]  I'm going to move quickly through calls today.
[00:50:51.612 --> 00:50:52.152]  877-789-2539.
[00:50:52.172 --> 00:50:53.052]  877-789-2539.
[00:50:55.313 --> 00:50:56.813]  Alex, 877-789-2539.
[00:50:56.953 --> 00:51:05.894]  But tell us if you're a first-time caller, and I will try to get you to the front of the line and in the order they receive.
[00:51:05.915 --> 00:51:10.315]  We'll put those two pieces of calculus together and come up with the answer.
[00:51:10.335 --> 00:51:10.375]  877-789-2539.
[00:51:10.395 --> 00:51:11.315]  Okay.
[00:51:11.335 --> 00:51:12.076]  Let's hit this stack of news.
[00:51:11.916 --> 00:51:19.416]   seven eight nine two five three nine. Okay, let's hit this stack of news. The
[00:51:19.416 --> 00:51:23.956]   Cobra tyranny. Now, first off, we've known they're going to bring in new
[00:51:23.956 --> 00:51:28.135]   lockdowns and new variants of the virus and new control systems because in all
[00:51:28.135 --> 00:51:31.876]   their drills and preparations by the Carnegie Rockefeller and other
[00:51:31.876 --> 00:51:35.036]   endowments that run all this, they've been saying that's the plan.
[00:51:35.062 --> 00:51:36.782]  So people keep asking, well how did you know this was going to happen?
[00:51:37.122 --> 00:51:39.703]  Now they're saying, oh new variants, new lockdowns are needed.
[00:51:39.743 --> 00:51:40.383]  Mask again.
[00:51:41.323 --> 00:51:47.625]  Because they want to cycle the tyranny on and off, so that any time opposition builds, they'll back off, but then they'll bring it back again.
[00:51:48.697 --> 00:51:53.320]  Because statistically, people will resist less during each cycle.
[00:51:54.441 --> 00:51:56.482]  Basic psychology.
[00:51:56.522 --> 00:51:57.223]  The voice of doom.
[00:51:57.243 --> 00:51:58.343]  Dr. Fauci warns U.S.
[00:51:58.363 --> 00:52:02.026]  could face more COVID lockdowns as he admits latest variants set to hit U.S.
[00:52:02.146 --> 00:52:02.966]  is less serious.
[00:52:03.327 --> 00:52:06.068]  Don McCromb, but we just can't say we're done.
[00:52:06.108 --> 00:52:28.546]   Yes, we're never done with your power grab and the trillions and trillions of dollars that special interest We're giving, not just here, but in other countries, out-of-the-taxpayer coffers in COVID relief, but there's one place they can steal the money even better, where there's no checks and balances on where it goes, and that is Ukraine.
[00:52:29.067 --> 00:52:34.030]  The little proxy war, which the Democrats now admit is an official proxy war with Russia.
[00:52:34.951 --> 00:52:41.435]  Dems ditch COVID funds to rush $40 billion to Ukraine.
[00:52:43.652 --> 00:52:45.353]  And let's look at what's happening with COVID.
[00:52:45.833 --> 00:53:13.862]   Whether you're in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, they're all reporting bizarre liver infections of a virus, but the children aren't testing positive for hepatitis A, B, or C. They're calling it hepatitis-like after they've been injected in what was in the previous studies of mRNA vaccines that a small percentage of people, but still substantive, Would get liver failure.
[00:53:15.163 --> 00:53:15.883]  And here it is.
[00:53:16.863 --> 00:53:23.204]  Japan reports more suspected cases of unexplained acute hepatitis in children.
[00:53:25.945 --> 00:53:29.286]  And major scientists and studies have come out proving it is the shots.
[00:53:32.306 --> 00:53:34.347]  Just a few weeks ago it was the first cases.
[00:53:34.407 --> 00:53:38.055]   Now it's spreading all over in The injected children.
[00:53:38.977 --> 00:53:44.789]  Sweden suffered fewer deaths per capita than much of Europe, despite refusing to enforce strict lockdowns.
[00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:47.034]  They were the lowest death rate.
[00:53:50.939 --> 00:53:51.920]  Can't make this up.
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:58.145]  Biden, FDA chief, insists misinformation is impacting life expectancy in the U.S.
[00:53:58.785 --> 00:54:02.008]  Life expectancy dropped in 2021, above 2020.
[00:54:02.428 --> 00:54:05.651]  When we had the vaccine, isn't that interesting?
[00:54:05.671 --> 00:54:15.479]  And all the actuaries from insurance companies in the Western world, wherever people took the shots, remember they didn't take the mRNA in China or Russia or a bunch of other places, like India refused it.
[00:54:16.923 --> 00:54:20.745]  They don't have the 40% increase in death between 18 and 63.
[00:54:20.585 --> 00:54:31.023]   18 and 63. But the head of the FDA says that you cannot have people questioning
[00:54:31.694 --> 00:54:35.896]  That's why you're dying, not from the experimental injections.
[00:54:35.936 --> 00:54:41.859]  And oh, Stephen Colbert, late show, halts production after Stephen Colbert shows COVID symptoms.
[00:54:42.319 --> 00:54:52.564]  He says he's had at least three of the shots and has been sick three times in the last year, twice in the last month with, wait for it, COVID.
[00:54:53.933 --> 00:54:57.195]  I want to statistics show you're much more likely to get COVID if you've been injected.
[00:54:57.635 --> 00:54:58.936]  I want to play this breakdown.
[00:54:59.517 --> 00:55:14.567]  There's a powerful explanation of the real rationale for masking from Lori Garrett to the National Academy of Medicine in 2018 saying masks are about creating fear.
[00:55:15.807 --> 00:55:17.589]  Masks are about creating fear.
[00:55:18.029 --> 00:55:21.191]  Here's what she had to say a year and a half before COVID.
[00:55:21.869 --> 00:55:28.293]  There's only a couple of countries that have ever really done large-scale studies to try and figure out what might work.
[00:55:28.693 --> 00:55:31.095]  Japan, it may not surprise you, is one of them.
[00:55:31.855 --> 00:55:43.690]   And they, in one of their large studies, they basically showed that the masks, it seemed like the major efficacy of a mask is that it causes alarm in the other
[00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:46.380]  person and so you stay away from each other.
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:51.740]   And that's what I think happened with SARS. When I was in the SARS epidemic, I saw everywhere all
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:56.459]   over Asia people started wearing these masks and it is alarming when you walk down a street and
[00:55:56.459 --> 00:56:02.860]   everybody coming towards you has a mask on. You definitely do social distancing. You definitely,
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:04.380]  it's just a gut thing.
[00:56:04.624 --> 00:56:06.384]  But did the mask really help them?
[00:56:06.884 --> 00:56:08.645]  Did the mask keep the virus out?
[00:56:09.205 --> 00:56:10.225]  Almost certainly not.
[00:56:11.486 --> 00:56:16.467]  If the virus was around their face, the mask would not have made the difference.
[00:56:18.788 --> 00:56:35.128]   But if you questioned that in the last two years on any big tech platform, no matter how much money you used to advertise it for your business, no matter how many people you promoted to, no matter if you had a thousand followers or a million, they would delete you. And now Bill Gates came out, last
[00:56:35.128 --> 00:56:41.088]   week we played the club, they said, "Oh, it turns out COVID's like the flu," but we
[00:56:41.088 --> 00:56:42.898]  didn't know that.
[00:56:42.898 --> 00:56:50.739]   When his modeling companies lied and said, "5 million dead here, a million dead in the UK,"
[00:56:50.739 --> 00:56:52.177]  and none of it was true.
[00:56:52.421 --> 00:57:11.557]  They lied on purpose, but now he's going to help run the government truth ministry, Ministry of Truth, and the very people that lied to us about everything and censored us, if we expose the hysteria and these rituals of idiocy, to see what we would put up with, they would then ban you.
[00:57:11.577 --> 00:57:23.236]   Or the skateboard Park in Los Angeles being covered with millions of dollars of sand.
[00:57:25.479 --> 00:57:27.983]  Filling it up so that no one could go there.
[00:57:29.608 --> 00:57:43.635]  So that no one would be able to enjoy themselves outdoors and get vitamin D. So they'd sit inside and not get medical treatment for the flu and other diseases, other viruses, and die while they kept people out of the nursing homes to see their families so they could quietly kill them.
[00:57:43.655 --> 00:57:47.457]  They get $53,000 for every bounty and every person they murdered.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.601]  And look at this photo for TV viewers.
[00:57:50.621 --> 00:57:58.345]  Trudeau wears a mask in Canada with a 90% vax rate for show, but not in Ukraine with a 35% vax rate.
[00:57:58.665 --> 00:58:00.826]  That's their fraudulent science you're not supposed to question.
[00:58:01.066 --> 00:58:02.387]  And why can't you question that science?
[00:58:02.407 --> 00:58:06.329]  Because it's not science, it's fraud, and the essence of science is questioning.
[00:58:07.290 --> 00:58:10.672]  On its face, this is all a giant fraud.
[00:58:11.332 --> 00:58:12.953]  All a huge lie.
[00:58:14.238 --> 00:58:15.598]  And I love this meme going around.
[00:58:15.598 --> 00:58:23.398]   It's got an image of Pfizer with a trendy 1970s businessman with a injector, Abner McNeill in his hand.
[00:58:23.398 --> 00:58:25.958]  And it sells 12 percent of the time.
[00:58:25.958 --> 00:58:27.837]  It works for a short time.
[00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:32.238]  Pfizer, what a great product to force people to make.
[00:58:32.238 --> 00:58:40.558]   And let's not forget what all these people did to us, like Piers Morgan saying, "Footballers who refuse to be jabs,
[00:58:40.558 --> 00:58:41.757]  we refuse treatment for injuries."
[00:58:42.063 --> 00:58:48.768]  After all, why should they trust doctors about treatment for broken legs and torn ligaments if they don't trust them about life-saving vaccine?
[00:58:48.968 --> 00:58:49.928]  Oh, that's not a vaccine?
[00:58:50.148 --> 00:58:50.869]  That's experimental?
[00:58:51.089 --> 00:58:51.850]  That was forced through?
[00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:57.874]  That the own British Ministry of Health said you shouldn't give to old people under 16 or folks with autoimmune problems?
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:09.547]  And then every hour I see articles of healthy athletes and students, high school, college, taking the shot and dying days later of heart attacks.
[00:59:09.908 --> 00:59:12.390]  There's the CBC reporting on that.
[00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:19.876]  University student remembered as a fabulous force died of swollen heart and heart attack.
[00:59:20.970 --> 00:59:22.392]  This is the mind control.
[00:59:22.472 --> 00:59:23.653]  This is the garbage.
[00:59:24.294 --> 00:59:27.497]  All right, we'll be right back on the other side with your phone calls.
[00:59:28.078 --> 00:59:32.643]  I've got more economic news and the big Russian developments and Putin clips coming up.
[00:59:32.723 --> 00:59:33.163]  Stay with us.
[00:59:34.264 --> 00:59:42.373]  So you remember two years ago, early into the global lockdown and the new biomedical tyranny, training wheels they had us on.
[00:59:43.723 --> 00:59:56.313]  I told you this is all just a test for future bigger lockdowns, and that as civilization collapses and the third world collapses, Pentagon studies show within 10 days, most people become homicidal maniacs of no electricity or food.
[00:59:56.714 --> 01:00:00.016]  Within 15, most people commit suicide or become cannibals.
[01:00:01.137 --> 01:00:07.062]  So then I said, it's like a modest proposal written by Jonathan Swift 300 years ago about the Irish starving to death.
[01:00:07.402 --> 01:00:08.323]  Nobody wanted to help them.
[01:00:08.824 --> 01:00:11.546]  So he said, well, why don't the Irish just sell their children to us to eat?
[01:00:13.325 --> 01:00:15.067]  And it was satire, but it woke people up.
[01:00:15.428 --> 01:00:17.771]  So I then said, well, I'll have to eat my neighbor then.
[01:00:18.111 --> 01:00:21.255]  And the media edited it out of context and, you know, went with that.
[01:00:21.355 --> 01:00:24.860]  But the point is, is that that's what's happening here.
[01:00:25.881 --> 01:00:27.363]  We'll actually intro the next segment with that.
[01:00:28.467 --> 01:00:39.730]  I told you two years ago, I said, when these lockdowns end, they're going to bring them back, but I said, they'll have climate lockdowns after that, officially and unofficially, because the prices will be so high, you won't be able to travel.
[01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:42.311]  Well now the headlines are, a new lockdown's here!
[01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:43.111]  Inflation!
[01:00:43.571 --> 01:00:45.851]  Americans planning summer travel face a new hurdle!
[01:00:45.911 --> 01:00:46.812]  High inflation!
[01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:50.773]  It's a broken social contract.
[01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:55.534]  They don't want you to be mobile, they don't want you to be free, they don't want you to be what they call uppity.
[01:00:59.514 --> 01:01:01.235]  We better unify and fight this, folks.
[01:01:02.476 --> 01:01:04.617]  All right, let's go to David, and then we'll go to Nicole.
[01:01:05.437 --> 01:01:06.918]  David in Texas, thanks for calling.
[01:01:08.218 --> 01:01:08.959]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[01:01:10.059 --> 01:01:15.762]  I just wanted to get your thoughts on the upcoming famine crisis.
[01:01:16.123 --> 01:01:17.463]  Are you going off-grid?
[01:01:17.523 --> 01:01:20.385]  What is your plan personally, if you don't mind me asking?
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:29.686]  Well, I mean, I spend 5% of my time in defense for myself and my family, and I spend 95% in offense trying to warn everybody and stop this.
[01:01:30.547 --> 01:01:44.797]  But we've got, you know, trailers in the countryside, water wells, backup power, fuel tanks, and gardens, and friends and family to work with, and... Yeah, that's the most important thing.
[01:01:46.658 --> 01:01:48.880]  I mean, we don't have anything elaborate or fancy or anything, but...
[01:01:50.458 --> 01:01:58.142]  Believe me, going out to the country on family property that we've had for a long time and getting ready made me not want to leave.
[01:01:58.162 --> 01:02:01.844]  I haven't been out to my dad's ranch in like three or four years.
[01:02:01.864 --> 01:02:02.865]  I used to go out there every month.
[01:02:04.307 --> 01:02:05.908]  And we're going back out there.
[01:02:05.928 --> 01:02:11.370]  Maybe we want to stay out there, but we have a lot of old ranch houses and things that are halfway fallen down.
[01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:13.951]  We've had family there for since the 1820s.
[01:02:14.351 --> 01:02:20.374]  Old homesteads are out there, but some of the ranch houses are 150 years old and they're just kind of spooky and creaky and weird.
[01:02:20.394 --> 01:02:23.215]  We're trying to fix them up, but it almost costs more money to do that.
[01:02:23.675 --> 01:02:27.297]  So we just, my dad and mom put a double wide trailer out there.
[01:02:28.057 --> 01:02:29.538]  And that's where we intend to stay.
[01:02:29.638 --> 01:02:31.760]  Everything basically collapses and goes to zero.
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:33.661]  We got a forestry operation.
[01:02:33.721 --> 01:02:35.962]  We got cows.
[01:02:36.643 --> 01:02:37.643]  We already have a ranch.
[01:02:37.663 --> 01:02:39.064]  We already had a little vineyard out there.
[01:02:39.104 --> 01:02:44.328]  We already have a forestry operation with pine trees.
[01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:48.691]  So we already have a sustainable operation out there with friends and family.
[01:02:49.171 --> 01:02:50.472]  And most of our family are veterans.
[01:02:51.012 --> 01:02:53.013]  And so they're all within a half mile of each other.
[01:02:53.073 --> 01:02:56.876]  So it's not the perfect place to be, but it's better than nowhere.
[01:02:58.283 --> 01:02:58.883]  Right, I agree.
[01:02:58.963 --> 01:03:01.084]  So I have one more question for you real quick.
[01:03:01.544 --> 01:03:08.266]  What do you say to the people who would maybe try to call you out for saying that, oh, Alex Jones didn't predict anything?
[01:03:08.286 --> 01:03:19.469]  I mean, all this Huxley and Edward Bernays and, you know, all these other people like these, like, I wouldn't call them revolutionaries, but they were just like philosophical revolutionaries, I would say.
[01:03:20.089 --> 01:03:23.310]  But like, what do you say to the people who say like, oh, you didn't predict anything?
[01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:24.570]  You didn't know any of this was coming?
[01:03:24.590 --> 01:03:27.291]  It was all them, you know, it was all the people in the past, you know?
[01:03:28.007 --> 01:03:29.089]  I would say absolutely.
[01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:31.674]  That's what I say all the time is this is not my opinion.
[01:03:31.694 --> 01:03:36.523]  This is on record with the bad guys and the good guys.
[01:03:37.685 --> 01:03:57.899]  Admitting this plan, and so I've been covering it for 28 years on air, and when we've gone in and read the Rockefeller documents and popularized their plan for lockdowns and masks and all that, and you know, we've broken a lot of stuff, but certainly I'm not trying to be the grand poobah oracle, the big kahuna that everybody comes to and only I know what's going on.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:01.802]  I'm trying to decompartmentalize known information.
[01:04:01.922 --> 01:04:07.627]   So what I say to those people is, okay, yes, I didn't predict anything.
[01:04:07.687 --> 01:04:17.256]  I showed you a real criminal battle plan that was in beta, hoping you would stand up and stop it, but of course the discussion goes back to, well, he's not right then.
[01:04:17.536 --> 01:04:18.437]  It just all came true.
[01:04:19.038 --> 01:04:20.720]  I don't even matter in this equation.
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:26.725]  I mean, we're putting in water wells and solar power, getting ready for total collapse here, and I just wish people would wake up and stop it.
[01:04:26.906 --> 01:04:29.008]  I don't give a rat's ass who gets the frickin' credit.
[01:04:30.023 --> 01:04:30.624]  Right, right.
[01:04:30.704 --> 01:04:31.765]  No, I totally agree.
[01:04:32.165 --> 01:04:38.251]  It shouldn't matter who, like, came up with the idea first because the idea really came from the globalists.
[01:04:38.271 --> 01:04:45.437]  Like, the seed of all of this, you know, like, destruction and terror and all this stuff comes from the globalists.
[01:04:45.517 --> 01:04:58.212]   It's just, you know, there were those people that were trying to call it out in the early stages before it got anywhere, but now, you know, you look around and Man, everyone, they're just using NLP and like psycho, like psycho, you know.
[01:04:58.612 --> 01:05:11.677]  They're using gaslighting behavioral psychology tactics on everybody on triple quadruple mixed-ness info to create entire systems of fraud to totally confuse people, but it's having the biggest effect on them and only making them look like clowns.
[01:05:11.997 --> 01:05:16.179]  Instead of stopping lying, they up the lying the next level and now they look like clowns.
[01:05:16.219 --> 01:05:18.259]  You see, they're drinking their own Kool-Aid.
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.581]  There's an old saying, you can't fool an honest man.
[01:05:22.501 --> 01:05:22.741]  Right.
[01:05:23.106 --> 01:05:23.907]  And it's the same thing.
[01:05:23.967 --> 01:05:26.148]  They fooled themselves, and that's what's so dangerous.
[01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:28.390]  100%, Alex.
[01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:28.390]  100%.
[01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:31.051]  Well, I'm here with you, and I'm praying for you.
[01:05:31.652 --> 01:05:32.332]  God bless you, brother.
[01:05:32.352 --> 01:05:32.933]  I appreciate you.
[01:05:32.953 --> 01:05:34.173]  Let's go to Nicole, Indiana.
[01:05:34.594 --> 01:05:37.896]  Let's talk about Venezuela and how bad things got coming to the USA.
[01:05:37.916 --> 01:05:38.777]  Hello, Nicole.
[01:05:38.817 --> 01:05:39.137]  Welcome.
[01:05:39.977 --> 01:05:40.438]  Hi, Alex.
[01:05:40.498 --> 01:05:41.699]  It's a pleasure to talk to you.
[01:05:41.719 --> 01:05:46.142]  I listened to you years ago, and I've been listening to you for the last two years.
[01:05:46.162 --> 01:05:48.863]  Also, I love the X3 Revival Shield.
[01:05:49.003 --> 01:05:49.244]  Thank you.
[01:05:49.264 --> 01:05:49.464]  It's great.
[01:05:51.187 --> 01:05:52.328]  Yes, Venezuela.
[01:05:53.188 --> 01:06:07.172]  Yeah, we went there in 2010, the last time we were there in 2015, and the amount of destruction that happened in those few short years was just heartbreaking.
[01:06:08.252 --> 01:06:11.773]  You know, you touched on the formula shortage here in the states.
[01:06:13.433 --> 01:06:23.673]   When we were there, I believe in 2014, you actually had to take your baby with a birth certificate On the chance that there might be formula in diapers.
[01:06:26.773 --> 01:06:30.134]  And Venezuela has more resources per square foot than any country in the world.
[01:06:30.154 --> 01:06:35.315]  They were the richest country in Latin America until Hugo Chavez took them over and now it is a wrecked hellhole.
[01:06:35.655 --> 01:06:37.075]  No dogs and cats on the streets.
[01:06:37.255 --> 01:06:38.295]  No birds on the streets.
[01:06:39.055 --> 01:06:41.436]  The people, thousands die a week of starvation.
[01:06:42.276 --> 01:06:58.672]   And just year after year after year of it, on purpose, by design, the country made a deal with the IMF and World Bank Yes, I mean, it was a joke, I believe, in 2014, how many inches of money that we would have to take just to, you know, go out to dinner.
[01:06:59.813 --> 01:07:02.675]  You know, it's not funny now, but it's serious.
[01:07:03.075 --> 01:07:04.556]  So I just wanted to touch on that.
[01:07:05.217 --> 01:07:06.117]  I appreciate all you do.
[01:07:06.638 --> 01:07:07.258]  I appreciate you.
[01:07:07.278 --> 01:07:08.599]  What was getting you down to Venezuela?
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:14.563]  We just take vacations, you know, and we wanted to do something different.
[01:07:14.784 --> 01:07:18.046]  And actually, we were on Margarita Island.
[01:07:18.869 --> 01:07:22.133]  Um, so it's actually off the coast of Venezuela.
[01:07:22.734 --> 01:07:25.718]  Um, so yeah, it's, um, we just kind of planned.
[01:07:25.838 --> 01:07:28.201]  I found it years ago and we thought, okay, we'll try it.
[01:07:28.341 --> 01:07:32.609]   And we made a lot of friends and Unfortunately, a lot of those friends had to leave.
[01:07:32.709 --> 01:07:34.350]  This is so bad.
[01:07:34.791 --> 01:07:35.331]  Absolutely.
[01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:40.515]  And then when they come here, the Democrats brainwash them into being communists, doing the same thing here.
[01:07:41.236 --> 01:07:42.077]  We had the media.
[01:07:42.117 --> 01:07:46.460]  We could actually bring on these people and then train them how America actually operates through free will.
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:47.461]  They'd be on board.
[01:07:47.501 --> 01:07:52.825]  But so many of them end up coming here to then do the same thing that destroyed their nation, to destroy our nation.
[01:07:52.865 --> 01:07:53.846]  Thank you so much, Nicole.
[01:07:53.886 --> 01:07:54.406]  Great call.
[01:07:54.787 --> 01:07:56.568]  More powerful calls straight ahead.
[01:07:56.949 --> 01:07:59.110]  And we'll come in with that little piece on I'll Eat My Neighbors.
[01:07:59.130 --> 01:07:59.491]  Stay with us.
[01:08:00.411 --> 01:08:00.952]  I'll admit it.
[01:08:02.673 --> 01:08:03.654]  I will eat my neighbors.
[01:08:04.114 --> 01:08:05.115]  I'm not letting my kids die.
[01:08:05.395 --> 01:08:06.296]  I'm just gonna be honest.
[01:08:06.736 --> 01:08:07.837]  My superpower is being honest.
[01:08:08.457 --> 01:08:18.605]  I've extrapolated this out, and I won't have to for a few years since I got food and stuff, but I'm literally looking at my neighbors now and going, I'm ready to hang them up and gut them and skin them and chop them up.
[01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:19.025]  And you know what?
[01:08:19.045 --> 01:08:19.385]  I'm ready.
[01:08:19.625 --> 01:08:20.826]  My daughters aren't starving to death.
[01:08:21.226 --> 01:08:21.947]  I'll eat my neighbors.
[01:08:22.667 --> 01:08:25.269]  See, my superpower is being honest.
[01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:26.230]  I'll eat your ass.
[01:08:26.850 --> 01:08:27.071]  I will.
[01:08:29.758 --> 01:08:31.859]  Combat model, optimum self-sufficiency.
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.080]  Probably the leader.
[01:08:33.921 --> 01:08:36.262]  The point is, is have you thought about that yet?
[01:08:36.522 --> 01:08:42.506]  Because I'm somebody that thought I could fix this, and I'm starting to think about having to eat my neighbors.
[01:08:42.946 --> 01:08:49.510]  You think I like sizing up my neighbor how I'm gonna haul him up by a chain and top his ass up?
[01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:50.691]  I'll do it!
[01:08:52.011 --> 01:08:53.352]  My children aren't going hungry!
[01:08:54.613 --> 01:08:55.854]  I will eat your ass!
[01:08:57.597 --> 01:09:00.538]  That's why I want the globalists to know, I will eat your ass first!
[01:09:01.539 --> 01:09:03.420]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:11.163]  Shock poll reveals Americans are okay with Ukraine losing the war with Putin's Russia.
[01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:23.549]  London Express, the monthly Democrat Institute Express poll of 1,500 Americans who are likely voters has shown 43% are okay with Ukraine losing, compared to 41% not okay, while 60% have no opinion.
[01:09:26.536 --> 01:09:35.323]  And even the Pope's come out against the war, saying the bad guys are the weapons manufacturers that started the war with Russia in the last eight years, and George Soros.
[01:09:37.385 --> 01:09:41.388]  That's a big deal, because he's been lockstep with these people on everything, and now he broke with them on that.
[01:09:41.909 --> 01:09:47.213]  That shows that people understand this is deadly dangerous, and Russia's not going to back down.
[01:09:47.373 --> 01:09:50.336]  And look, nothing against Zelensky that he's a gay porn star.
[01:09:51.562 --> 01:09:54.185]  It's just the issue is he's fully compromised.
[01:09:54.265 --> 01:09:57.228]  I'm not judging him, you know, that he's a gay porn star.
[01:09:57.248 --> 01:09:57.908]  He's a handsome guy.
[01:09:58.289 --> 01:10:00.391]  The point is, is that that's what's going on.
[01:10:00.431 --> 01:10:04.154]  It's why they can blackmail him just like the other gay porn star, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:10:05.195 --> 01:10:05.536]  Okay.
[01:10:06.704 --> 01:10:08.225]  Word to begin here.
[01:10:09.646 --> 01:10:11.908]  I got some big January 6th news I want to hit.
[01:10:12.548 --> 01:10:13.869]  I got some big Russia news.
[01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:15.871]  I'm going to hit that at the start of the next hour.
[01:10:15.891 --> 01:10:17.512]  Let's go right back to your calls, Jim.
[01:10:17.612 --> 01:10:18.813]  This hour is full of calls here.
[01:10:19.774 --> 01:10:22.396]  Let's go ahead and go to the order they received.
[01:10:22.876 --> 01:10:24.558]  Carlos in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:10:24.578 --> 01:10:24.878]  Welcome.
[01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:27.160]  Hey, Alex.
[01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:28.140]  How you doing?
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.142]  I want to say I love the shirt.
[01:10:30.202 --> 01:10:31.803]  I just bought me a crap ton of shirts.
[01:10:31.883 --> 01:10:33.685]  I'm hoping to get more this week.
[01:10:33.565 --> 01:10:39.284]   I wear the crap out of them my wife gets scared because she thinks we're gonna get attacked, but never been attacked
[01:10:39.284 --> 01:10:42.885]   I don't think I ever will there's a lot of people that support you Alex, and hopefully they'll continue
[01:10:42.885 --> 01:10:49.264]   Well, thank you And again, I had designed hundreds of shirts myself.
[01:10:49.564 --> 01:10:50.544]  Didn't promote most of them.
[01:10:50.584 --> 01:10:51.384]  Some were big sellers.
[01:10:51.444 --> 01:10:52.005]  Most weren't.
[01:10:52.405 --> 01:10:53.665]  We had a stockpile of them.
[01:10:54.326 --> 01:10:56.026]  And so we had 63,000 shirts.
[01:10:56.066 --> 01:10:57.307]  We're selling them all out at cost.
[01:10:57.347 --> 01:11:00.468]  We're down to 15,000 of the original shirts.
[01:11:00.528 --> 01:11:04.310]  When those are gone, we'll never redesign or never, you know, re-release those.
[01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:09.813]  So if folks want to go over what's left there, they're at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:11:10.133 --> 01:11:14.636]  We have one shirt that's being sold above cost, and that's the Alex Jones was right shirt.
[01:11:15.216 --> 01:11:16.877]  It's been sold out, but it's been backordered.
[01:11:16.897 --> 01:11:20.920]  Those are coming in early next week for everybody that wants to preorder it, make sure they get that.
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:22.261]  It's a limited edition.
[01:11:22.541 --> 01:11:24.482]  We're doing this run of them and no more.
[01:11:24.782 --> 01:11:30.806]  There's another designer version coming in, and that'll be it for this design of the Alex Jones was right shirt at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:11:30.846 --> 01:11:31.626]  It helps keep us on air.
[01:11:31.646 --> 01:11:33.768]  So thank you, Carlos, for keeping us on air.
[01:11:33.808 --> 01:11:34.088]  Go ahead.
[01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:59.848]   Hey Alex I wanted to talk about last year I called you last year my mom came out from COVID but I have two examples of being treated at the hospital and being treated by with Dr. Bartlett by what I heard on your show with Dr. Bartlett he's a hundred percent well just like your parents Well, my mom got screwed up by the damn Remdesivir.
[01:11:59.868 --> 01:12:01.748]  They really jacked her up.
[01:12:01.948 --> 01:12:06.649]  Remdesivir kills about 38% of people they give it to and doesn't even help you with COVID.
[01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:11.071]  It's a murder weapon put out by Fauci just like you put out AZT to kill people that are HIV.
[01:12:12.851 --> 01:12:17.312]  And what I'm doing with the two examples that I have is I tell people about it.
[01:12:17.432 --> 01:12:23.674]  They don't believe me, but I show them pictures of my mom pre-COVID and post-COVID and my dad pre-COVID and post-COVID.
[01:12:24.375 --> 01:12:25.716]  My dad's as strong as a damn ox.
[01:12:26.056 --> 01:12:27.537]  There's nothing wrong with him.
[01:12:28.298 --> 01:12:30.899]  But he has to take care of my mom.
[01:12:30.919 --> 01:12:36.463]  He's the one that's making sure she goes to her doctor's visit, the medications that they're giving her.
[01:12:36.483 --> 01:12:38.464]  I don't know if they're helping her or if they're killing her.
[01:12:38.504 --> 01:12:39.845]  I don't know what the hell's going on.
[01:12:39.905 --> 01:12:41.866]  But I'm trying my best.
[01:12:41.906 --> 01:12:45.088]  I'm probably going to have to call Dr. Peter McCullough or something to help me out.
[01:12:45.128 --> 01:12:45.909]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:12:48.016 --> 01:12:54.643]  Well, there's no doubt that Rendezvier, they knew would cause kidney failure, renal failure, and they did it.
[01:12:54.683 --> 01:12:56.124]  These people are sick murderers.
[01:12:56.865 --> 01:12:57.986]  See what they can get away with.
[01:12:59.247 --> 01:13:11.889]   They are very evil, Alex, but you know what, I think in the end, Giving these examples and us talking about it and me, I'm trying to put more traffic to the show every chance I get.
[01:13:12.429 --> 01:13:15.752]  People that didn't believe me two years ago or ten years ago.
[01:13:16.212 --> 01:13:18.273]  They're calling me now, Carlos, what do we do?
[01:13:18.373 --> 01:13:21.956]  I'm like, well, I've been getting ready for about twelve years, buddy.
[01:13:22.156 --> 01:13:23.537]  You're about ten years behind.
[01:13:25.145 --> 01:13:26.286]  Well, that's the good news.
[01:13:26.366 --> 01:13:29.568]  That's the silver lining here is the awakening is explosive.
[01:13:29.608 --> 01:13:31.489]  Thank you, Carlos, for the call.
[01:13:31.549 --> 01:13:36.752]  Let's go to Jack in Wisconsin, where the Democrats are firebombing pro-life facilities.
[01:13:37.292 --> 01:13:37.893]  Go ahead, Jack.
[01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:38.253]  Welcome.
[01:13:39.874 --> 01:13:40.654]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[01:13:40.714 --> 01:13:50.160]  I want to be like a cool cat and kind of link some things together with yarn, specifically adrenochrome, abortion, Russia, corona and coronavirus.
[01:13:51.221 --> 01:14:01.648]   First, I think you guys need to always take into consideration that we don't know the true abortion numbers because they don't take into account or count the chemical abortions with the pill.
[01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:12.252]  The only numbers we get are the surgical abortions and the estimates that have been done by the pro-life groups are like hundreds and hundreds of millions of chemical abortions.
[01:14:13.406 --> 01:14:20.168]  And I think it's linked up with the ambrosia blood harvesting adrenochrome, like in Escape from L.A.
[01:14:20.228 --> 01:14:45.389]   with Snake Plissken, where like there's old people who need to take anti-rejection drugs in order to prolong their life by taking the blood and organs and limbs from the youth, which is connected to Russia because they have a voluntary stem cell That's right, that's why they want every country to take the shots so that they can cover up all the death numbers.
[01:14:45.248 --> 01:14:50.887]   low vaccine rates which is important to have a control group for coronavirus and
[01:14:50.887 --> 01:14:54.608]   the corresponding vaccine. That's right that's why they want every country to
[01:14:54.608 --> 01:14:58.927]   take the shots so that they can cover up all the death numbers but if you have
[01:14:58.927 --> 01:15:01.807]   countries that don't and they're all healthy like some of the African
[01:15:01.807 --> 01:15:05.608]   countries and Russia well then that shows it's the shot causing the problem.
[01:15:05.608 --> 01:15:09.328]  Yes totally.
[01:15:07.428 --> 01:15:13.809]  And I think maybe NATO's trying to invade Russia to control that resource as well as the other resources.
[01:15:14.309 --> 01:15:17.970]  And yesterday I was so glad you brought up all the Q disinformation stuff.
[01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:42.114]   You know, I'm a long-haul InfoWars fan, and I remember just when you were having that cell phone guy, cable operator smoking cigarettes and talking about all the surveillance stuff, and you were way ahead of the curve, Snowden and Q stuff started Sucking all the air out of the room and taking us down a maze to a dead end, you know?
[01:15:42.794 --> 01:15:55.038]  And me, myself, you know, I remember with Jerome Corsi, you know, I'd call in and make some wild comments and then there would be a bunch of bots on the chat room saying like, oh, you should contact Jerome Corsi.
[01:15:55.658 --> 01:15:59.479]  And, you know, I think the Q thing, like you said, was one giant big trap.
[01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:13.376]  And evidence for that, you can look into think tank groups in the late 90s and early 1000s, where Infiniti and other car companies focus group the letter Q as being very popular to boomers.
[01:16:13.856 --> 01:16:22.020]  That's why we have the Infiniti Q car series, Audi Q series, because people were drawn to the letter Q. So I thought it was kind of suspicious timing.
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:25.261]  And the nail in the coffin for Q was the election.
[01:16:25.908 --> 01:16:32.994]  I'm sure you remember how they were saying that President Trump was going to come and fix everything, everyone was going to get arrested.
[01:16:33.614 --> 01:16:34.215]  Never happened.
[01:16:34.715 --> 01:16:39.239]  And everybody knows a wizard, being a wizard, is very expensive, all the wizarded stuff.
[01:16:39.559 --> 01:16:42.281]  If you have wizard power, you flex those powers and show off.
[01:16:42.541 --> 01:16:42.782]  Why?
[01:16:42.802 --> 01:16:45.124]  Because you need money for all this wizard stuff.
[01:16:45.444 --> 01:16:46.305]  Well, here's what's going on.
[01:16:46.325 --> 01:16:47.485]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:16:48.427 --> 01:16:53.869]  There's a lot of things that the Q movement said that were true, because it was everything myself and countless others had already documented.
[01:16:54.269 --> 01:16:57.150]  And then people would say, why don't you talk about Bohemian Grove?
[01:16:57.230 --> 01:16:57.790]  Q does.
[01:16:57.851 --> 01:16:59.971]  And I'm like, what about the Federal Reserve?
[01:17:00.011 --> 01:17:00.431]  Q does.
[01:17:00.451 --> 01:17:01.552]  What about child trafficking?
[01:17:02.172 --> 01:17:07.734]  And it was just like, Q got all the credit, which I didn't care about getting credit, except then it made it like it was God.
[01:17:07.774 --> 01:17:09.395]  Like, whatever it says is true.
[01:17:09.715 --> 01:17:11.115]  Q exposed the New World Order.
[01:17:11.135 --> 01:17:12.596]  No one knew about it until Q came along.
[01:17:12.636 --> 01:17:13.736]  And I'm like, excuse me?
[01:17:14.457 --> 01:17:16.177]  So it was all disgusting.
[01:17:16.297 --> 01:17:17.258]  And the big tell.
[01:17:18.206 --> 01:17:29.968]  Was three, four years ago, when everybody else was being censored, Apple, Google, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram would push Q stuff and just push it to the top and wouldn't censor it.
[01:17:30.348 --> 01:17:37.949]  Now once they stole the election and they were done with Q, they purged all those people and shut them down and they ran off.
[01:17:37.989 --> 01:17:40.150]  He got even more insane and said JFK Jr.
[01:17:40.170 --> 01:17:40.870]  was coming to save them.
[01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:43.590]  You might not make it back.
[01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:47.131]  And once you get on board with Satan, ladies and gentlemen, you go straight to hell.
[01:17:49.127 --> 01:17:52.490]  The whole program of Fauci and the New World Order is to take you down.
[01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:58.254]  All right, let's go right back to your phone calls here on this live Tuesday, May 10th transmission.
[01:17:58.274 --> 01:18:08.182]  A ton of news and clips we haven't gotten to with these powerful Putin clips next hour, but let's go right back to your calls and the order they were received right now.
[01:18:08.743 --> 01:18:10.624]  Evan in California.
[01:18:10.744 --> 01:18:11.525]  Welcome, Evan.
[01:18:13.727 --> 01:18:14.968]  Alex, pleasure to talk to you.
[01:18:15.495 --> 01:18:16.576]  Hey, I'm a director.
[01:18:17.356 --> 01:18:23.900]  I went to film school and I learned a lot of weird stuff that I've heard you referred to before, how people would offer you things.
[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:26.802]  I was a regular in a couple of different TV shows.
[01:18:26.922 --> 01:18:30.404]  I'd be invited to a party that was almost like a pre-groomer party.
[01:18:30.424 --> 01:18:32.445]  I'd see questionable stuff.
[01:18:33.105 --> 01:18:36.787]  I would say something, I'd get a yellow slip, I'd be dropped from that TV show.
[01:18:37.368 --> 01:18:38.568]  I went to film school.
[01:18:38.788 --> 01:18:43.031]  I tried to come up with some shows to produce and to pitch.
[01:18:43.658 --> 01:19:17.623]   And I learned a lot of the stuff that you had referred to earlier, and I want to point out something that I think is extremely powerful, is that the image of a woman, a sexy woman, used to be painted on a plane when guys would go to fight in World War II, and Hollywood learned with the directive of the intelligence community that if they didn't show pretty, and let me say, like a big-breasted, sexy, voluptuous woman, if they didn't show them, Then occasionally when they would introduce a sexy woman like a Thelma Hayek, she pretty much had to be a communist.
[01:19:18.263 --> 01:19:26.647]  And they realized that the image of a woman is unbelievably powerful for motivating a guy to be a man.
[01:19:27.367 --> 01:19:29.268]  And they took away the feminine form.
[01:19:29.308 --> 01:19:46.396]   And if I could refer to one thing, Alex, if you've got a second, I want to point out one technique in filmmaking When you go to film school, they're teaching you really a lot about the propaganda and the studies that were done in war propaganda and things like that, that a dog would rather be abused than ignored.
[01:19:47.056 --> 01:19:52.318]  And you'd see really strange things being introduced to be a director.
[01:19:52.898 --> 01:20:07.113]   And one of the things I found fascinating was, if you have a character come in, some pretty woman in a red dress, And you want her to be the noble character, you put the color wheel around her where her dress stays a vivid red.
[01:20:07.893 --> 01:20:21.689]   And something you don't really realize when you watch a movie or a TV show, if they don't do that, if they have a transgender character come in in a nice vivid dress and all the colors around them Let me boil this down, what you're saying.
[01:20:21.649 --> 01:20:25.048]  keeps that color vivid and you think you like that person.
[01:20:25.048 --> 01:20:27.769]  Let me boil this down to what you're saying.
[01:20:27.769 --> 01:20:33.809]   First they get rid of the image of a voluptuous powerful archetypal goddess and then they
[01:20:33.809 --> 01:20:38.769]   replace it with disgusting horrible goblin like men but in the beautiful colors that
[01:20:38.769 --> 01:20:41.128]  you've been taught to think are good.
[01:20:41.116 --> 01:20:49.703]  And so it is an assault on the very basis of the male-female relationship that forms humankind and civilization.
[01:20:49.723 --> 01:20:53.266]  And yes, that's what all of this is, is poison to bring us down.
[01:20:53.866 --> 01:20:58.450]  And so women are encouraged to dress like men, and then men are encouraged to dress like women.
[01:20:59.110 --> 01:20:59.350]  Well said.
[01:20:59.170 --> 01:21:04.649]   And then little kids are taught that big, fat, disgusting men are feminine, and then
[01:21:04.649 --> 01:21:09.409]   the women have their breasts cut off and don't look like women.
[01:21:09.409 --> 01:21:10.409]  This is the plan.
[01:21:10.409 --> 01:21:13.369]  They've done it with the chemicals, in the food and water.
[01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:15.729]  This is a very sophisticated takeover operation.
[01:21:15.729 --> 01:21:16.729]  Well said.
[01:21:16.729 --> 01:21:22.250]   And if I could just point out one more thing, is if you see a woman in a red dress that
[01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:27.509]   they want you initially to like, but then when the colors aren't balanced around her,
[01:21:27.509 --> 01:21:31.469]   You don't realize that within 30 seconds, those colors are bleeding out.
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:35.523]  And subconsciously, you don't realize that you actually think it's your instinct.
[01:21:35.923 --> 01:21:39.086]  You say, wow, I just don't like that woman anymore.
[01:21:39.406 --> 01:21:44.291]  You think like you're solving the mystery and you don't realize it's actually your brain.
[01:21:44.311 --> 01:21:44.951]  That's right.
[01:21:44.991 --> 01:21:46.593]  And then patriots that they don't like.
[01:21:47.133 --> 01:21:49.934]  They'll also blur things out, distort your face with images.
[01:21:50.795 --> 01:21:52.815]  They'll put different types of music under it.
[01:21:53.376 --> 01:21:56.837]  But once you're aware of it, you see it everywhere, and realize these are weapon systems.
[01:21:56.877 --> 01:22:08.742]  What you're saying is, even in film school you were taught this, and once you got deeper into it, they did tests to see if you were corruptible, and when you weren't, you weren't part of the club, because you were being recruited for a weapon system to carry out evil, not to be an artist.
[01:22:09.042 --> 01:22:09.583]  God bless you.
[01:22:09.603 --> 01:22:10.223]  Powerful points.
[01:22:12.694 --> 01:22:14.075]  All right, let's take more calls here.
[01:22:14.735 --> 01:22:16.576]  Let's talk to Mike in England.
[01:22:16.796 --> 01:22:18.477]  Mike, welcome and thank you for holding.
[01:22:18.497 --> 01:22:19.937]  Hi, Alex.
[01:22:20.037 --> 01:22:21.018]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:22:21.358 --> 01:22:22.058]  And God bless you.
[01:22:22.078 --> 01:22:25.900]  I really do appreciate everything that the Lord does through you.
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:36.084]  You know, like the Democrats are trying every possible way to distract people and trying to rig the election, and they're failing.
[01:22:37.005 --> 01:22:48.617]   But I think the fail-safe for them is, I would expect from everything that I'm seeing over That they're going to push for World War III by before the midterms to really make it happen.
[01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:54.482]  And I think people need to be held accountable for treason right now.
[01:22:54.842 --> 01:23:01.648]  People have got to be indicting them, if anyone has the means to do so, to put a stop to this.
[01:23:01.689 --> 01:23:05.332]  Like Fauci, you know, for genocide and certainly mass murder.
[01:23:05.352 --> 01:23:05.812]  Well, exactly.
[01:23:05.872 --> 01:23:07.174]  Why do you think the Pope has been...
[01:23:08.991 --> 01:23:10.291]  Lockstep with the globalists.
[01:23:11.052 --> 01:23:13.332]  Synced up and suddenly come out and say, stop the war.
[01:23:13.612 --> 01:23:14.373]  The West started it.
[01:23:14.393 --> 01:23:15.333]  They provoked Russia.
[01:23:15.573 --> 01:23:16.913]  They overthrew the elected president.
[01:23:17.213 --> 01:23:18.674]  They've been attacking Russian-held areas.
[01:23:18.714 --> 01:23:19.054]  Stop.
[01:23:20.134 --> 01:23:22.615]  Because even the Vatican knows this could end the frickin' world.
[01:23:23.175 --> 01:23:27.696]  And why should they do that for a bunch of out-of-control leftist globalists who've lost control?
[01:23:28.116 --> 01:23:30.997]  The New World Order, in its current permutation, has failed.
[01:23:31.757 --> 01:23:36.619]  And even within the power structure, there are people that understand the brakes need to be put on now.
[01:23:38.944 --> 01:23:44.944]   any minute now because I mean it's stupid if Borg Johnson, Boring Johnson, you know
[01:23:44.944 --> 01:23:48.303]  saying oh we should nuke Russia. They're listening to that.
[01:23:48.303 --> 01:23:52.434]   Nancy Pelosi going to say oh well we're here to win. I mean these are idiots.
[01:23:52.434 --> 01:23:53.744]  That's beyond treason.
[01:23:53.744 --> 01:23:59.584]   There needs to be gallows and I'm due process of course but there needs to be
[01:23:59.584 --> 01:24:04.544]   gallows for these people because they're gonna lead to the death of millions.
[01:24:02.834 --> 01:24:12.541]  Well, long before we talk about gallows for people, we should be talking about politically exposing the globalists so people can victim in the court of public opinion.
[01:24:12.561 --> 01:24:15.964]  Then out of that will flow the justice we need.
[01:24:16.004 --> 01:24:16.924]  Thank you, Mike, for the call.
[01:24:17.765 --> 01:24:19.967]  I've got a lot on that starting the next hour.
[01:24:20.688 --> 01:24:25.752]  Biden's DOJ is threatening January 6th defendants with life in prison after walking inside the U.S.
[01:24:25.772 --> 01:24:35.820]  Capitol and taking pictures while the mayor of Chicago is calling for physical call to arms and violence over Roe v. Wade.
[01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:51.762]   We got so much news on that front coming up in the next hour and we will get to everybody here like local Gentile And Dean, and Jay, and Todd, and Matt, and Tito, and Trucker in the Badlands.
[01:24:52.202 --> 01:24:55.344]  Chris and everybody, your phone calls are coming up.
[01:24:55.884 --> 01:25:01.527]  And these incredible Putin clips I've got from their big World War II Victory Day speech.
[01:25:02.027 --> 01:25:05.289]  See what you think about that coming up next hour.
[01:25:06.230 --> 01:25:11.493]  And then there's a really amazing confirmed HD zoom of the moon during the day.
[01:25:12.742 --> 01:25:15.564]  And what looks like spacecraft flying around on the dark side of the moon.
[01:25:15.945 --> 01:25:30.237]  I can tell you there is a secret drone base where robots, robot space planes, have delivered payloads, 3D printer machines, and other systems in a test for Elon Musk's base.
[01:25:30.817 --> 01:25:37.903]  And I believe that these images are drone-delivered, robot-delivered payloads being delivered to that base.
[01:25:39.024 --> 01:25:41.386]  And I'm not just speculating there.
[01:25:43.223 --> 01:25:51.930]  When Trump was in office, I was let in by some folks that are involved at the highest levels.
[01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:55.113]  And they just said, I said, why are you telling me something that's classified?
[01:25:55.133 --> 01:25:57.475]  And they said, well, we want it out there.
[01:25:58.536 --> 01:26:01.038]  And Musk wants it out there, and you're being given this information.
[01:26:01.579 --> 01:26:03.260]  And I never really did anything with it.
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:07.243]  I mean, when you get stuff like that, and you know these are the real people involved.
[01:26:07.744 --> 01:26:12.488]  I mean, well-known people in the whole secret space program.
[01:26:13.368 --> 01:26:14.970]  And Musk has talked about how he wants to do this.
[01:26:15.070 --> 01:26:18.513]  I can tell you from my sources, this is already going on, so that's coming up.
[01:26:19.293 --> 01:26:22.613]  in the next hour as well.
[01:26:22.613 --> 01:26:24.853]  Infowars.com is the tip of the spear.
[01:26:24.853 --> 01:26:28.212]   Bandod video is not just us, but hundreds of other great suppressed
[01:26:28.212 --> 01:26:29.652]  and censored contributors.

[01:26:33.913 --> 01:26:35.573]  to share with everyone you know.
[01:26:35.573 --> 01:26:40.293]   Please share with everyone, bandod video, and comment on the videos,
[01:26:40.293 --> 01:26:45.293]   and again, get them out to everyone you can, because the whole New World Order program
[01:26:45.293 --> 01:26:46.933]  is about suppressing that.
[01:26:46.933 --> 01:26:51.613]   It's also about suppressing your immune system, and we have it discounted right now.

[01:27:05.573 --> 01:27:09.453]  astragalus root, loetium root, and...
[01:27:09.453 --> 01:27:19.453]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:27:10.916 --> 01:27:12.896]  Angelica Root and so much more.

[01:27:17.318 --> 01:27:17.638]  Ultra 12.

[01:27:33.144 --> 01:27:34.504]  Also, Vazobeats available.

[01:28:04.344 --> 01:28:14.308]  The bank that owns the Mint that has started putting these out the last few years just sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than what we're selling these for.
[01:28:14.648 --> 01:28:18.570]  And when you get three or more, you can get these at 50% off and they fund the Infowar.

[01:28:38.295 --> 01:28:40.435]   success We have had together would not have happened
[01:28:40.435 --> 01:28:44.875]   We are the tip of the spear you are the tip of the spear and I salute you and thank you visit mfulworthstore.com
[01:28:44.875 --> 01:28:52.154]   today Keep your eyes on the road and your hands upon the wheel
[01:28:52.154 --> 01:28:58.955]   Coming up we're gonna cover the latest war news as it escalates out of control and what Putin had to say about it
[01:28:58.955 --> 01:29:06.760]   That's the next segment in your phone calls But I wanted to play before we go to break and come back and take your calls, a little bit of what Tucker Carlson had to say.
[01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:10.181]  And I don't disagree with Tucker, but I can have this as a teaching moment in my view.
[01:29:11.302 --> 01:29:14.943]  Tucker says that Biden doesn't care about religious groups.
[01:29:14.963 --> 01:29:16.704]  No, he hates Christians.
[01:29:17.881 --> 01:29:19.822]  Tons of globalists don't care about the economy.
[01:29:19.842 --> 01:29:22.543]  They want to break you on record to take control of you.
[01:29:22.563 --> 01:29:29.207]  So this isn't incompetence, this is by design shutting the country off and attacking Americans' freedoms, particularly Christians.
[01:29:29.387 --> 01:29:29.867]  Here it is.
[01:29:30.547 --> 01:29:39.912]  A week ago exactly, an unnamed saboteur of the Supreme Court leaked a draft opinion by Justice Sam Alito explaining why Roe v. Wade ought to be overturned.
[01:29:40.748 --> 01:29:46.932]  Now, people went completely hysterical over it, but actually, as a legal matter, Alito's views were not especially controversial.
[01:29:47.413 --> 01:29:48.634]  Roe is bad law.
[01:29:48.934 --> 01:29:54.318]  Over the past half century, many have acknowledged that, including many pro-choice Democrats, including Joe Biden.
[01:29:55.379 --> 01:30:04.503]  So at this point, 49 years in, if you're an officeholder who supports legal abortion, the obvious solution is to vote for legal abortion.
[01:30:04.643 --> 01:30:06.944]  Pass a law, like they do in democracies.
[01:30:07.824 --> 01:30:08.864]  It's not complicated.
[01:30:09.225 --> 01:30:10.425]  That's how it's supposed to work.
[01:30:11.065 --> 01:30:12.446]  But Democrats have no interest in that.
[01:30:12.526 --> 01:30:17.228]  Democracy is a tiresome process, and worst of all, the outcome isn't always guaranteed.
[01:30:17.848 --> 01:30:19.809]  They prefer what they call direct action.
[01:30:20.589 --> 01:30:21.389]  Not democracy.
[01:30:21.909 --> 01:30:27.611]  So liberal activists immediately set about threatening Supreme Court justices and then attacking Christianity.
[01:30:28.371 --> 01:30:37.034]  A group called Ruth Sent Us, which is named in honor of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, posted the home addresses of every Supreme Court justice who is conservative.
[01:30:37.074 --> 01:30:37.654]  Why'd they do this?
[01:30:37.694 --> 01:30:42.315]  Well, of course, to invite violence and harassment, to get them to change their votes.
[01:30:43.136 --> 01:30:50.201]   Then Ruth Sent Us sent this to practicing Catholics across the country, quote, Stuff your rosaries and your weaponized prayer.
[01:30:50.442 --> 01:30:55.510]  We'll be burning the Eucharist to show our disgust for the abuse Catholic churches have condoned for centuries.
[01:30:57.298 --> 01:30:59.539]  Now, you'd think the Biden administration might have something to say about this.
[01:30:59.599 --> 01:31:00.500]  It was all public.
[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:02.601]  Joe Biden purports to be a Catholic.
[01:31:03.162 --> 01:31:05.823]  Intimidating judges, by the way, is a federal crime.
[01:31:06.744 --> 01:31:10.006]  But no, the Biden administration did not try and stop this.
[01:31:10.026 --> 01:31:11.227]  The Justice Department did nothing.
[01:31:11.267 --> 01:31:17.250]  In fact, from her podium at the White House, the president's publicist endorsed the coming harassment very clearly.
[01:31:17.351 --> 01:31:24.774]   Quote, The president's view is that there's a lot of passion, a lot of fear, a lot of sadness for many, many people, Jen Psaki explained.
[01:31:25.434 --> 01:31:28.555]  So the message to Joe Biden's abortion militia could not have been clearer.
[01:31:28.635 --> 01:31:30.316]  Go forth and terrorize.
[01:31:30.656 --> 01:31:31.636]  That's the word from the White House.
[01:31:31.716 --> 01:31:32.637]  So that's exactly what they did.
[01:31:33.257 --> 01:31:40.257]  Here's the mob this weekend outside Brett Kavanaugh's house.
[01:31:40.257 --> 01:31:53.096]   Brett Kavanaugh is a Supreme Court Justice, but he's also a man, and a husband, and a father, as you just saw.
[01:31:53.291 --> 01:31:59.296]  He lives in a pretty normal neighborhood outside D.C., doesn't have a wall around the house, and more to the point, his two daughters are home.
[01:32:00.157 --> 01:32:05.721]  So imagine what it must have been like inside the house if you're Brett Kavanaugh or his wife or his daughters.
[01:32:06.442 --> 01:32:07.623]  The people outside didn't care.
[01:32:07.663 --> 01:32:12.146]  The woman who organized that protest outside Kavanaugh's house lives right down the street, apparently.
[01:32:12.566 --> 01:32:16.409]  She's a deeply unhappy individual called Lacey Wooten Holloway.
[01:32:17.190 --> 01:32:21.012]  Wooten Holloway brought the mob to Kavanaugh's house for a very specific reason.
[01:32:21.212 --> 01:32:28.355]  Not because she was angry, which she is, but because she wants Brett Kavanaugh to change his views and support Roe v. Wade.
[01:32:28.395 --> 01:32:29.956]  She was intimidating a federal judge.
[01:32:30.076 --> 01:32:30.677]  All of them were.
[01:32:30.997 --> 01:32:32.377]  And once again, that's a federal crime.
[01:32:32.397 --> 01:32:33.378]  It could not be clearer.
[01:32:34.098 --> 01:32:38.320]  And yet, Lacey Wooten Holloway, who bragged about organizing this, was not arrested.
[01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:39.421]  She wasn't even scolded.
[01:32:39.501 --> 01:32:40.541]  Instead, she was rewarded.
[01:32:41.102 --> 01:32:45.204]  Lacey Wooten Holloway got a glowing profile in the Washington Post.
[01:32:46.324 --> 01:32:51.788]  So once again, in effect, our leaders in Washington sent a very clear message to the mob, as they did for BLM.
[01:32:52.448 --> 01:32:53.109]  Do what you want.
[01:32:53.549 --> 01:32:54.370]  We're on your side.
[01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:56.331]  It's not like you're insurrectionists.
[01:32:56.711 --> 01:32:57.372]  So the mob did.
[01:32:58.212 --> 01:33:01.895]  Look what the mob did to this Christian counseling center in Wisconsin over the weekend.
[01:33:02.771 --> 01:33:05.492]  If abortions aren't safe, then you aren't either.
[01:33:05.632 --> 01:33:10.794]  That's just part of the message outside Wisconsin Family Action here, and it continues inside the building.
[01:33:11.134 --> 01:33:14.415]  What you're seeing around me right now, this isn't the answer to anything.
[01:33:14.515 --> 01:33:21.097]  Also written in debris and glass in her office, Wisconsin Family Action President Julianne Appling says the message is clear.
[01:33:21.217 --> 01:33:26.199]  It's precipitated by the leaked Supreme Court opinion, right?
[01:33:26.539 --> 01:33:27.159]  I mean, it's obvious.
[01:33:27.219 --> 01:33:31.241]  Madison police say it appears someone threw a Molotov cocktail inside the building.
[01:33:33.752 --> 01:33:35.533]  Glory to our valiant armed forces!
[01:33:35.553 --> 01:33:35.873]  For Russia!
[01:33:35.913 --> 01:33:36.433]  For Victory!
[01:33:36.253 --> 01:33:42.813]   that had nothing to do with Samuel Alito's opinion. We'll be back. So here's some of the Russian victory day parade
[01:33:42.813 --> 01:33:49.602]   statements of Vladimir Putin. We're going to get to in a moment. But first, here he is saying "Ura" to the troops
[01:33:49.602 --> 01:33:51.253]  and then saying it back.
[01:33:51.253 --> 01:33:59.253]  Glory to our valiant armed forces! For Russia! For Victory!
[01:33:59.253 --> 01:34:00.253]  Ura!
[01:34:00.253 --> 01:34:11.253]  Ura!
[01:34:11.253 --> 01:34:22.253]  As the world marches towards thermonuclear war.
[01:34:22.801 --> 01:34:23.681]  And as the U.S.
[01:34:23.761 --> 01:34:27.884]  admits they're officially our government in a war with Russia.
[01:34:27.904 --> 01:34:32.687]  There's an article by Patrick Buchanan of Buchanan.org up on Infowars.com.
[01:34:32.707 --> 01:34:33.827]  You should read Buchanan.
[01:34:34.288 --> 01:34:35.528]  It's Ukraine's war now.
[01:34:37.129 --> 01:34:37.850]  America's war.
[01:34:39.124 --> 01:34:43.387]  There's other reports here that Putin's likely to impose martial law on Russia to support war effort.
[01:34:43.487 --> 01:34:43.707]  U.S.
[01:34:43.767 --> 01:34:47.370]  intelligence chief says who knows if any of that is true.
[01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:50.632]  Here's Putin accuses the West of plotting to threaten Russia.
[01:34:50.753 --> 01:34:58.838]  What's most important, he points out that the West's values and freedoms have been canceled by the cabals that have hijacked our countries, which is true.
[01:34:58.858 --> 01:34:59.259]  Here it is.
[01:35:00.815 --> 01:35:05.935]   The United States, especially after the fall of the Soviet Union, started speaking about
[01:35:05.935 --> 01:35:11.635]   their exclusivity, their exclusive status, humiliating not only the whole world but its
[01:35:11.635 --> 01:35:20.315]   own satellites, who have to pretend they can't notice and swallow it up, lap it up.
[01:35:20.315 --> 01:35:22.494]  But we are a different country.
[01:35:22.494 --> 01:35:24.555]  Russia has a different character.
[01:35:24.555 --> 01:35:30.755]   We shall never give up our love for our motherland, our faith in our traditional values, the custom
[01:35:30.755 --> 01:35:35.534]  of our forebears and respect for all nations and cultures.
[01:35:35.534 --> 01:35:42.055]  In the West, these thousands-old values have been cancelled.
[01:35:42.095 --> 01:36:00.874]   This moral degradation is at the basis of the cynical falsification of the history of World War II, rampant Russophobia, praising traitors and The mockery of the memory of victims and those who built victory.
[01:36:01.214 --> 01:36:06.518]  We know that the American veterans who wanted to attend the parade in Moscow were banned from doing so.
[01:36:07.679 --> 01:36:16.225]  But I want them to know we are proud of your achievements, of your exploits and your contribution to our common victory.
[01:36:16.605 --> 01:36:21.528]  We honor all members of the Allied armies, Americans, British.
[01:36:22.829 --> 01:36:33.653]  The courageous members of resistance and Chinese soldiers, all who contributed to the defeat of Nazism and imperialism.
[01:36:33.833 --> 01:36:59.047]   Today, the soldiers of Donbass and together with Russian soldiers are fighting in the battlefield where the servicemen of Suvorov and Brusilov Svyatoslav and the many, many heroes of the Russian country.
[01:36:59.067 --> 01:37:02.931]  I address the servicemen of Donbass.
[01:37:03.051 --> 01:37:15.822]  You are fighting for the motherland, for its future, so that lessons of the World War II are not forgotten, so that there is no place in history for the punitive divisions of Nazis.
[01:37:17.898 --> 01:37:19.179]  So that's where the world is.
[01:37:19.219 --> 01:37:23.341]  Here's the New York Times headline, Biden speeds up military aid to Ukraine, drawing U.S.
[01:37:23.361 --> 01:37:24.101]  deeper into war.
[01:37:24.122 --> 01:37:28.884]  $40 billion now extra in weapons.
[01:37:30.285 --> 01:37:36.128]  And remember, Bono's One Foundation under fire for giving little over 1% of funds to charities.
[01:37:36.148 --> 01:37:39.730]  That's why he calls it One, and he's over there raising money.
[01:37:39.790 --> 01:37:40.791]  He steals again.
[01:37:41.211 --> 01:37:42.392]  These people are a pack.
[01:37:43.397 --> 01:37:48.127]  World Economic Forum, Bilderberg Group, criminals and our enemies of humanity.
[01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:51.755]  And then, meanwhile, in New York City and Times Square...
[01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:55.551]  They're running big Jumbotron ads.
[01:37:56.432 --> 01:38:00.415]  A pro-Nazi advertisement appears in Times Square which bemoans the defeat of Hitlerism.
[01:38:00.955 --> 01:38:07.180]  There hasn't been this much open pro-Nazism in America since British bourgeoisie in 1930, says Alexander McKay.
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:15.986]  But regardless, now trying to say that the Russians commemorating World War II is bad is something else, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:16.906 --> 01:38:18.647]  Absolutely out of control.
[01:38:19.608 --> 01:38:24.151]  Speaking of Nazis, Local Gentile is what he goes by from New York.
[01:38:24.171 --> 01:38:28.514]  He wants to talk about Greg Reese's report he did a week ago on Nazism.
[01:38:29.135 --> 01:38:31.016]  Local Gentile, welcome to the Airwaves.
[01:38:32.777 --> 01:38:33.918]  Yeah, how you doing Alex?
[01:38:33.938 --> 01:38:40.639]   Real quick, I just want to touch on one other thing about how space, like what a setup they have with us with all the
[01:38:40.639 --> 01:38:47.159]   alien movies and uh you know and the AI and all this stuff. I believe it's uh that you cannot
[01:38:47.159 --> 01:38:52.019]   reach space unless you transcend, your spirit can only go to space. That's what I believe
[01:38:52.019 --> 01:38:57.609]   anyway and it's all a setup for the fake alien invasion which correlates with the shots using
[01:38:57.609 --> 01:39:02.529]   GPS inside of people that I think could be tracked by hunter killer drones and the heavy
[01:39:02.529 --> 01:39:09.228]   metals that are being sprayed is to create a false grid, a reflection point for the 5G radio wave to
[01:39:09.228 --> 01:39:10.158]  track everybody.
[01:39:10.428 --> 01:39:15.789]  To create, you know, like a footprint across the whole entire realm or whatever.
[01:39:15.809 --> 01:39:18.810]  At least the parts that we occupy, that we're herded into.
[01:39:19.371 --> 01:39:21.211]  And you can see it coming a mile away.
[01:39:21.531 --> 01:39:39.325]   You got the 5G, you got the The GPS that's been infused inside people, now all they gotta do is send out these hunter-killer drones, blame it on a fake alien invasion, kill most of us, also by creating the reflection point with the radio waves, so it's also gonna nuke the hell out of us too.
[01:39:39.345 --> 01:39:40.086]  You know what I mean?
[01:39:40.186 --> 01:39:41.667]  That's the real nuke in my opinion.
[01:39:41.707 --> 01:39:43.489]  I think nuclear bombs is all BS.
[01:39:44.326 --> 01:39:46.067]  Nuclear bombs are really radiation.
[01:39:46.347 --> 01:39:50.069]  Because radar came out four years before the Manhattan Project.
[01:39:50.490 --> 01:39:53.952]  And when it came out, they realized, hey, we got one hell of a weapon on ourselves.
[01:39:54.352 --> 01:39:57.073]  And whenever they get a weapon, you know they got to test it out.
[01:39:57.093 --> 01:39:58.374]  And then I have another thing.
[01:39:58.434 --> 01:39:59.815]  I want to know what you think about that.
[01:39:59.895 --> 01:40:01.156]  And then I got one more thing.
[01:40:01.656 --> 01:40:02.597]  I got to move on here.
[01:40:02.637 --> 01:40:03.657]  We got to get to all the callers.
[01:40:03.677 --> 01:40:05.118]  I think the world is round.
[01:40:05.138 --> 01:40:10.141]  I don't think people think it's flat or bad people, but I myself am an amateur astronomer.
[01:40:10.622 --> 01:40:14.364]  We can put footage on screen of Saturn coming out behind the moon.
[01:40:14.384 --> 01:40:27.712]   I mean, I've sat there drinking a six pack of beer for like five hours with a mead The telescope that tracks stuff, and I can sit there and watch the moons of Jupiter spinning.
[01:40:27.732 --> 01:40:32.155]  I can watch the round planets turning with my own eyeballs.
[01:40:32.695 --> 01:40:34.636]  I've got a green filter back when I had time to do it.
[01:40:34.696 --> 01:40:36.498]  It's been in storage for probably 15 years.
[01:40:36.878 --> 01:40:45.603]  Got a big 12-inch reflector, and I can put a green filter on it, look at the sun, and sit there and watch the sun in an hour turn quite a few degrees.
[01:40:45.623 --> 01:40:48.445]  I mean, I'm looking at a big ball in the sky.
[01:40:50.086 --> 01:40:52.287]  I mean, how do you respond to that?
[01:40:54.568 --> 01:40:58.089]  I mean, you could see things, but that doesn't mean you can get there.
[01:40:58.109 --> 01:40:58.929]  You know what I mean?
[01:40:58.949 --> 01:41:03.251]  I believe they're projections, imagery for us to see, but it's the cosmos.
[01:41:03.291 --> 01:41:04.311]  That's where the Almighty is.
[01:41:04.331 --> 01:41:07.032]  So you think we're all in a giant Truman Show?
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:09.960]  No, I don't think that at all.
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:11.681]  I think it's a realm.
[01:41:11.841 --> 01:41:12.741]  We can't describe it.
[01:41:13.581 --> 01:41:21.123]  It's true that they're using the aluminum dioxide, not just for weather modification, but for over-the-horizon radar.
[01:41:21.144 --> 01:41:26.145]  A lot of what you said I think is accurate, other than the Earth being flat.
[01:41:27.185 --> 01:41:29.746]  Separately, you had a point about Gregory's.
[01:41:30.976 --> 01:41:34.379]  I was just saying, with the Nazism, I believe he's correct.
[01:41:34.759 --> 01:41:39.983]  Because if you look at the word Ashkenazi, which is Eastern European Jews, right?
[01:41:40.344 --> 01:41:44.387]  Which, you know, they're not all bad people, but they do have religious fanatics, right?
[01:41:44.427 --> 01:41:47.389]  That have hijacked religion, just like Muslim extremists, right?
[01:41:47.409 --> 01:41:48.770]  We have Jewish extremists, right?
[01:41:49.191 --> 01:41:51.372]  So they throw it, they leave a calling card.
[01:41:51.412 --> 01:41:54.855]  The word Nazi, Ashkenazi, Nazism.
[01:41:55.095 --> 01:41:56.497]  Is anybody picking up on this yet?
[01:41:56.817 --> 01:41:58.838]  Because what was the real- Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:42:02.392 --> 01:42:20.818]   I don't know what I can say to someone saying, because the acronym for National Socialist Workers Party, or whatever, is similar to a group of Eastern European Jews' name, it's just, Hitler Did not like the Jews and went after the Jews.
[01:42:21.639 --> 01:42:24.720]  And I think similarities in those names is just not fair.
[01:42:25.481 --> 01:42:36.146]  I mean, I will say this, there were a lot of powerful Jews on record that would rob Jews trying to get out of Europe and the Nazis would take that money from those Jews and let them survive and let them keep a lot of it.
[01:42:36.166 --> 01:42:39.768]  And that was what George Soros did, it's what Madeleine Albright's father did.
[01:42:39.788 --> 01:42:41.789]  I mean, there's 60-minute shows about this.
[01:42:41.869 --> 01:42:46.712]  So those are terrible, horrible people.
[01:42:47.538 --> 01:42:55.110]  I reject the ADL's guilt that America's Nazi and the Founding Fathers are Nazi and we take on that we're Nazis and they're the good guys and we're the bad guys.
[01:42:55.130 --> 01:43:01.961]  Certainly there are some of those leftist organizations that cloak their anti-free speech behavior in countering anti-Semitism.
[01:43:03.149 --> 01:43:07.554]  I just stay out of the racial and religious stuff and try to promote freedom for everybody.
[01:43:08.235 --> 01:43:12.740]  And I know a lot of great Jews, like Dr. Zalinko, that are really fighting the New World Order.
[01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:15.843]  And obviously there's bad Jews as well, like there are bad people in every group.
[01:43:16.424 --> 01:43:17.345]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:43:17.685 --> 01:43:20.628]  All right, more calls straight ahead on the other side of the order received.
[01:43:20.949 --> 01:43:21.930]  Infowars.com.
[01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:22.751]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:43:23.832 --> 01:43:29.576]  Alright, we got a lot of great callers on the line and I'm going to move to you all very quickly now here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:30.257 --> 01:43:39.344]  In the next segment I'm going to hit some really big abortion January 6 news and the midterms and how that all ties together because this is really serious.
[01:43:39.744 --> 01:43:40.725]  The precedent being set.
[01:43:41.784 --> 01:43:48.207]  On January 6th for everybody, and it's the globalist big play here domestically and overseas, and it's again extremely dangerous.
[01:43:48.708 --> 01:43:53.410]  What the New World Order's done in Ukraine, they want to do here with arresting you for your speech next.
[01:43:53.450 --> 01:43:55.251]  They know they're losing, they know people are waking up.
[01:43:55.631 --> 01:44:01.194]  They're in a lot of trouble, so that's why we've got to push now to wake people up harder than ever and not submit to their bullying.
[01:44:01.815 --> 01:44:03.916]  The answer to suppression of speech is more speech.
[01:44:05.316 --> 01:44:07.137]  All right, the order of the calls are received here.
[01:44:07.197 --> 01:44:08.598]  Let's go to Dean in New York.
[01:44:08.638 --> 01:44:09.539]  Dean, thanks for calling.
[01:44:09.579 --> 01:44:09.899]  Go ahead.
[01:44:11.071 --> 01:44:11.752]  Oh, thank you.
[01:44:11.772 --> 01:44:13.033]  Thanks for taking my call, Alec.
[01:44:13.874 --> 01:44:15.936]  I'd like to say you're a master of your discipline.
[01:44:17.578 --> 01:44:21.902]  10th degree black belt, maybe higher, of numerous disciplines.
[01:44:23.003 --> 01:44:24.805]  I hope your wife's doing well after the holidays.
[01:44:25.145 --> 01:44:26.767]  Yes.
[01:44:27.187 --> 01:44:32.152]  And I wanted to bring up about Pete Budacek and his partner there.
[01:44:32.799 --> 01:44:38.784]  They have an infant and I'm wondering if they have their formulas since he's the transportation secretary.
[01:44:39.744 --> 01:44:44.728]  Well I mean men can have breast and breast feed according to the FDA and CDC.
[01:44:44.768 --> 01:44:45.449]  It's disinfo.
[01:44:45.469 --> 01:44:48.431]  We don't believe a man can have a uterus and a man can have babies.
[01:44:48.451 --> 01:44:52.895]  So I guess Pete Buttigieg, remember they even showed them, oh we just had our baby in a hospital bed.
[01:44:53.275 --> 01:44:56.978]  I mean they just love to gaslight us and train us to accept fraud.
[01:44:58.186 --> 01:44:59.067]  Mm-hmm.
[01:44:59.287 --> 01:45:04.491]  I'm wondering if anybody did an independent test on the formula that was recalled.
[01:45:05.332 --> 01:45:07.434]  Could it have been recalled or not?
[01:45:07.594 --> 01:45:08.335]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:45:08.395 --> 01:45:09.776]  Well, it's not just the big recall.
[01:45:09.816 --> 01:45:15.761]  It's supply chain breakdowns and it's one person gets COVID even though they're not sick, they're asymptomatic, they shut down the plants.
[01:45:16.162 --> 01:45:20.906]  This is all designed to destroy our economy and vertically integrated and consolidated, Dean.
[01:45:22.914 --> 01:45:26.676]  Hey, I got turned on by your show by a friend of mine, Curly.
[01:45:26.756 --> 01:45:27.577]  He passed away in 2000.
[01:45:27.837 --> 01:45:29.797]  He was a radio personality.
[01:45:30.518 --> 01:45:31.098]  He loved you.
[01:45:31.118 --> 01:45:34.159]  If you could say a prayer for him someday, privately.
[01:45:34.339 --> 01:45:36.300]  Was I ever even a guest on Curly's show?
[01:45:37.961 --> 01:45:42.023]  He did a night show, and I think he more of called you.
[01:45:42.943 --> 01:45:46.165]  Up here in Utica, New York, I believe it was.
[01:45:46.225 --> 01:45:47.825]  We love you, Curly, and you're a great guy.
[01:45:47.885 --> 01:45:48.446]  God bless you.
[01:45:48.466 --> 01:45:48.906]  Thank you, Dean.
[01:45:49.921 --> 01:45:50.481]  Absolutely.
[01:45:50.502 --> 01:45:51.903]  Let's go to Jay in Ohio.
[01:45:51.983 --> 01:45:52.823]  Jay, thanks for calling.
[01:45:52.883 --> 01:45:53.123]  Go ahead.
[01:45:54.244 --> 01:45:55.045]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[01:45:56.626 --> 01:45:57.967]  I wear your shirt.
[01:45:58.468 --> 01:46:00.449]  I spread the word and the message.
[01:46:01.670 --> 01:46:04.572]  I watched the episode you had there with the guest, Barnes.
[01:46:04.612 --> 01:46:05.753]  They're the attorney.
[01:46:06.373 --> 01:46:23.626]   And I'm wondering, could we somehow get a show on where Barnes is on and call in all the sheriffs and have the sheriffs call in and maybe put them You know, boost them up and have them understand how strong their constitutional duty is.
[01:46:23.666 --> 01:46:28.467]  Well, more and more sheriffs do realize that it's their job being elected.
[01:46:29.927 --> 01:46:32.228]  The highest elected official in the county is really the sheriff.
[01:46:33.148 --> 01:46:35.189]  And the sheriffs are really starting to get it.
[01:46:35.769 --> 01:46:38.330]  Soros has come in and tried to elect a bunch of sheriffs.
[01:46:38.370 --> 01:46:39.510]  That's failed overall.
[01:46:39.970 --> 01:46:42.871]  He's succeeded at getting district attorneys and county attorneys.
[01:46:44.511 --> 01:46:45.051]  In charge.
[01:46:45.111 --> 01:46:47.132]  And he is just a reign of criminal terror.
[01:46:47.992 --> 01:46:51.252]  Here in Austin, they're letting bank robbers out in a day.
[01:46:51.772 --> 01:46:53.113]  Armed robbers out in a few hours.
[01:46:53.173 --> 01:46:55.113]  People that shoot multiple people are being released.
[01:46:55.573 --> 01:46:57.694]  I mean, it is crazy dangerous.
[01:46:58.154 --> 01:47:01.534]  But if you're a conservative or a Christian, they'll throw the book at you for anything.
[01:47:01.854 --> 01:47:03.035]  People say, well, why do you live here?
[01:47:03.055 --> 01:47:04.075]  Well, my family's from here.
[01:47:04.755 --> 01:47:05.835]  Our infrastructure's from here.
[01:47:05.875 --> 01:47:07.476]  I've been here since high school.
[01:47:07.796 --> 01:47:10.616]  If I had the money, I would move outside of Austin.
[01:47:11.176 --> 01:47:12.197]  I still love the town.
[01:47:12.997 --> 01:47:14.057]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:47:16.339 --> 01:47:20.565]  But why couldn't they put together like an army of sheriffs and go out?
[01:47:20.665 --> 01:47:31.883]   I mean, all these things that all these crazy people are doing, letting out criminals and And totally dissolving the border?
[01:47:32.383 --> 01:47:34.403]  Well, a sheriff only has jurisdiction in their county.
[01:47:35.484 --> 01:47:38.405]  But the sheriffs can create multi-jurisdictional task forces.
[01:47:38.425 --> 01:47:42.006]  The problem is the feds did that and under statute they have to control it.
[01:47:42.606 --> 01:47:44.126]  And so that's what's the corruption of the sheriffs.
[01:47:44.166 --> 01:47:48.167]  But yes, we need local control and sheriffs are key to that fight.
[01:47:48.507 --> 01:47:49.308]  Great points, Jay.
[01:47:50.388 --> 01:47:52.629]  All right, Alyssa in New York.
[01:47:52.689 --> 01:47:53.069]  Thank you.
[01:47:53.089 --> 01:47:53.389]  Go ahead.
[01:47:54.810 --> 01:47:56.212]  Hi, my name's Alicia.
[01:47:56.232 --> 01:47:58.254]  I'm calling from Catsville, New York.
[01:47:58.795 --> 01:48:07.725]  I just wanted to say thank you for everything that you do, for fighting for everyone every day, and I'm praying for you and your broadcast, and I bought your supplement.
[01:48:08.987 --> 01:48:14.633]  And I just wanted to ask you, do you think that there's hope for our future?
[01:48:15.779 --> 01:48:21.183]  Well there has to be a hope for our future and our children and God tells us that evil will rise up and do a lot of horrible things that it's now doing.
[01:48:21.843 --> 01:48:25.806]  Prophecy is being fulfilled and then we'll have to go through it and then come out stronger on the other side.
[01:48:26.487 --> 01:48:28.288]  And so we will make it through this.
[01:48:28.728 --> 01:48:30.329]  The question is how bad will it be?
[01:48:30.409 --> 01:48:31.991]  God leaves that up to us.
[01:48:32.570 --> 01:48:37.730]   And so I think that's where we're at, but we are seeing systemic design collapse of
[01:48:37.730 --> 01:48:40.369]  the world economy and system for depopulation.
[01:48:40.369 --> 01:48:45.070]   Did you see me play that club of Rome clip earlier, where the Davos group is openly talking
[01:48:45.070 --> 01:48:47.131]  about killing the majority of us?
[01:48:47.131 --> 01:48:49.331]  Yes, it freaks me out.
[01:48:49.331 --> 01:48:51.490]  It's very, very real.
[01:48:51.441 --> 01:48:57.183]  And again, when you see the mainstream media saying it doesn't exist, while it does, they are aiding and abetting this.
[01:48:57.243 --> 01:48:59.784]  It's just monstrous crime being committed.
[01:48:59.824 --> 01:49:04.747]  So of course a group that wants to depopulate us released a virus and then gave us a deadly shot.
[01:49:04.807 --> 01:49:07.828]  We just have to come to grips with they're really doing it to us.
[01:49:09.148 --> 01:49:10.169]  Yeah.
[01:49:10.389 --> 01:49:14.691]  I'm 26 and I noticed, like my friends, I try to tell them this stuff and they think I'm crazy.
[01:49:15.518 --> 01:49:19.242]  I do have a few family members that are older than me that agree with me.
[01:49:19.282 --> 01:49:20.403]  They see what's going on.
[01:49:21.424 --> 01:49:23.966]  It's scary.
[01:49:23.986 --> 01:49:25.848]  Well, here's the biggest thing you can do.
[01:49:27.233 --> 01:49:28.294]  Warn friends and family.
[01:49:28.314 --> 01:49:31.937]  Tell them about this broadcast and other broadcasts and things that you think are informative.
[01:49:32.317 --> 01:49:32.937]  Share videos.
[01:49:32.957 --> 01:49:33.498]  Share articles.
[01:49:33.558 --> 01:49:34.859]  And say, listen, I care about you.
[01:49:34.979 --> 01:49:36.260]  I need your help to stop this.
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:41.584]  We've all got to wake up and stop this multinational corporate fascist takeover of the New World Order.
[01:49:42.284 --> 01:49:47.689]  And some may not listen now, but they're going to listen later with the hyperinflation and the shortages.
[01:49:47.729 --> 01:49:50.791]  And they need to know who did it because that's how we stop it.
[01:49:50.871 --> 01:49:51.972]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:54.449]  Moving quickly here.
[01:49:55.329 --> 01:49:56.770]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:49:57.570 --> 01:50:00.631]  Let's talk to Trucker in the Badlands in Texas.
[01:50:00.671 --> 01:50:01.011]  Welcome.
[01:50:03.052 --> 01:50:04.052]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:50:04.172 --> 01:50:04.852]  Good?
[01:50:04.892 --> 01:50:13.255]  You know, we're still fighting back and in many ways stronger than ever, but it's crazy to be inside the New World Order now and to know it's all going to go down.
[01:50:13.295 --> 01:50:16.516]  We tried to stop it, but at least we won't be caught flat-footed now.
[01:50:17.396 --> 01:50:17.916]  Well, good.
[01:50:18.016 --> 01:50:19.616]  That prefaces my question.
[01:50:19.777 --> 01:50:21.177]  I wanted to ask a hypothetical.
[01:50:21.815 --> 01:50:22.295]  Question.
[01:50:22.636 --> 01:50:40.207]  If you could inject yourself in any political role in the United States, or not, in the world, and you had a team of people that you could also inject into any political organization in the world, what would you do to defeat the globalists once and for all?
[01:50:40.307 --> 01:50:42.028]  Where would you want people in position?
[01:50:42.769 --> 01:50:44.150]  What would you expose?
[01:50:44.910 --> 01:50:46.691]  How would you defeat them in a perfect world?
[01:50:47.892 --> 01:51:09.453]   If we had somebody like President Trump that was fully informed, A president could start doing weekly fireside chats with video presentations showing Gates and Harari and Daszak and all of them saying, we're going to create world government, we're going to depopulate, showing the documents they created the virus.
[01:51:10.362 --> 01:51:18.725]  And explain to the public that there's a multinational movement to take over nation states and turn humans into a commodity and depopulate the rest.
[01:51:19.246 --> 01:51:30.810]  And that we need, as a humanity, to wake up to that and use our force of will and our buying power to organize and peacefully say to the big corporations, we're aware of what you're doing in your world government.
[01:51:31.691 --> 01:51:32.891]  We're not going to accept it.
[01:51:33.211 --> 01:51:34.332]  And we say, stop it now.
[01:51:34.392 --> 01:51:34.952]  It's over.
[01:51:35.672 --> 01:51:36.873]  And just that.
[01:51:38.314 --> 01:51:43.319]  Directly addressing the globalists and what they're doing would devastate their operations overnight.
[01:51:43.339 --> 01:51:44.620]  Stay there, trucker, in the badlands.
[01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:46.482]  I'll elaborate on that when we come back.
[01:51:46.542 --> 01:51:48.063]  That would be the biggest way.
[01:51:48.604 --> 01:51:53.849]  That's not happening, so we've got to do it grassroots everywhere and get folks elected like Bolsonaro and Orban.
[01:51:55.051 --> 01:51:57.673]  Wayne Allyn Root is always a powerful guest host.
[01:51:57.693 --> 01:52:04.519]  He'll be hosting the fourth hour coming up ladies and gentlemen in about 30 minutes from now.
[01:52:05.239 --> 01:52:10.844]   I've got a bunch of economic news and January 6th, abortion news.
[01:52:10.884 --> 01:52:16.225]  We are taking your phone calls right now, and I'm going to go to every single caller that is left on the board.
[01:52:16.365 --> 01:52:21.547]  Curly, Chris, Jim, Amanda, Todd, Jason, Jonathan, Tito, and others.
[01:52:22.147 --> 01:52:23.567]  We're going to the order they received.
[01:52:23.687 --> 01:52:25.388]  Chris in New York, you're on the air.
[01:52:27.546 --> 01:52:32.108]  Alex, the Joe Rogan idea of doing a new movie is a great idea, but I don't think you have the time.
[01:52:32.148 --> 01:52:33.428]  I don't think we have the time.
[01:52:33.488 --> 01:52:36.589]  So, Patriots, you need to get the videos put together.
[01:52:36.649 --> 01:52:37.489]  Grab those clips.
[01:52:37.930 --> 01:52:39.050]  Grab the timestamps.
[01:52:39.130 --> 01:52:42.491]  Write up your own movies, and let's make them available to Alex.
[01:52:42.551 --> 01:52:45.632]  If Alex likes it, maybe he'll steal your clip and record it for himself.
[01:52:46.112 --> 01:52:50.074]  Let's get this done by July 4th, and let's celebrate a new July 4th.
[01:52:50.134 --> 01:52:53.575]   So, You don't have time to do another movie.
[01:52:53.615 --> 01:52:57.637]  Yeah, you're talking about the Alex Jones is right movie idea that Joe Rogan has that needs to be done.
[01:52:57.657 --> 01:53:05.341]  And really the most effective thing waking people up right now is Alex Jones clips and other Patriot clips decades ago predicting all this.
[01:53:05.961 --> 01:53:09.183]  That on Instagram and Twitter and places is really having a big effect.
[01:53:09.203 --> 01:53:10.704]  There's so many predictions that came true.
[01:53:11.144 --> 01:53:15.226]  People can also re-put out the clips that have already been out there because they take them down.
[01:53:15.266 --> 01:53:16.647]  They get millions of views, they take them down.
[01:53:16.707 --> 01:53:19.268]  Just re-upload them again and it's having a huge effect.
[01:53:19.288 --> 01:53:20.909]  Just let people know they're under attack.
[01:53:21.289 --> 01:53:22.610]  Let them understand the globalist program.
[01:53:22.650 --> 01:53:33.357]  I was going to hold the other guy over, the trucker, and kind of elaborate on his ideas, but if we had the bully pulpit and could actually reach people like a president could, or others, we could stop this.
[01:53:33.397 --> 01:53:46.685]  That's why I've really been pushing members of Congress that know what's going on to not eat around the edges, but strike right at the New World Order and expose it for what it is, a genocidal, eugenics, transhumanist death cult.
[01:53:48.979 --> 01:53:57.402]  Well Patriots, get these, find those clips, record where they are, write that up, make some videos, put them out there, let's go, get them to Alex and we can start to take this thing over.
[01:53:58.262 --> 01:54:00.843]  Well that's really, thank you sir, that's really what's already happened.
[01:54:01.863 --> 01:54:11.086]  We didn't go out and dig up all these clips of where I predicted all the specifics of lockdowns and masks and rolling lockdowns and power outages and carbon lockdowns.
[01:54:11.106 --> 01:54:14.327]  I mean, people went and found all those and they're finding more every day.
[01:54:14.347 --> 01:54:18.128]  I mean, I've got a couple on my list here today that I probably don't even have time to get to.
[01:54:19.168 --> 01:54:21.511]  But that really is one of the most effective things we've got.
[01:54:21.751 --> 01:54:22.652]  And I always knew that.
[01:54:22.712 --> 01:54:33.783]  I knew that if we weren't able to fully stop them launching all this, and they were building it, preparing it in beta, that once they launched it, it would really wake people up that we were able to predict it with precision.
[01:54:33.803 --> 01:54:38.387]  That would show them that the rest of what we're now saying is going to happen is going to happen if people don't take action.
[01:54:39.088 --> 01:54:46.569]  And I played that Davos group member saying we want to kill the majority of the public and we're going to do it very slowly and very peacefully, cutting your resources off.
[01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:52.031]  I mean, these are real declarations of war against you and your family and myself as well.
[01:54:52.911 --> 01:54:53.631]  And I believe in you.
[01:54:53.711 --> 01:54:55.251]  I believe we're going to rally and stop this.
[01:54:55.311 --> 01:54:56.551]  It's starting to happen all over the world.
[01:54:57.032 --> 01:55:02.032]  Leaders are getting elected that are way more hardcore than Trump was, like Bolsonaro, like Orban and many others.
[01:55:02.593 --> 01:55:04.253]  All right, let's move to more calls here.
[01:55:06.650 --> 01:55:09.291]  Now whether you trust him or not, Vladimir Putin's talking about all this stuff now.
[01:55:09.752 --> 01:55:12.373]  So I mean, we're starting to turn the worm here.
[01:55:12.393 --> 01:55:14.394]  We're starting to really change things.
[01:55:15.555 --> 01:55:19.717]  Let's go ahead and go to Tito in California.
[01:55:19.737 --> 01:55:20.357]  Tito, welcome.
[01:55:21.538 --> 01:55:22.798]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:55:22.818 --> 01:55:23.479]  I'm a big fan.
[01:55:23.519 --> 01:55:24.979]  You woke me up about five years ago.
[01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:27.661]  I live in California in Sonoma County.
[01:55:28.081 --> 01:55:32.623]  And the reason why I'm calling is that because we need help out here in California to get rid of Gavin Newsom.
[01:55:32.663 --> 01:55:35.685]  And this is the candidate right now running, Anthony Tremino.
[01:55:36.198 --> 01:55:42.883]  He's Cuban and Mexican, but was born in L.A., so he's 100% American, and I think he'd be the, you know, the Santa of the West.
[01:55:42.903 --> 01:55:45.264]  Well, I mean, we know Newsom lost the election.
[01:55:45.304 --> 01:55:47.506]  We know Blue Satates are engaged in election fraud.
[01:55:47.986 --> 01:55:51.489]  We know they're shipping in fentanyl, and so your big problem is election fraud.
[01:55:51.729 --> 01:55:59.995]  They caught all those trucks full of ballots for Newsom that were just made up with dummy, you know, list of names of dead people or folks that moved out of the state.
[01:56:00.535 --> 01:56:05.619]  The problem is people leave California to get away from it, but then they're still there voting for years after they leave.
[01:56:05.699 --> 01:56:15.206]  So, your biggest issue is election fraud, but everybody should still run, because that's how you expose the fraud, and it's how you get in the elections, and it's how you use the election process to educate people.
[01:56:15.686 --> 01:56:20.889]  So, I believe California and other states, I don't believe, I know, are under election fraud bondage.
[01:56:20.929 --> 01:56:31.335]  That's why the Justice Department, that's captured and controlled by the New World Order, doesn't want people to talk about it because it's the Achilles heel or the chink in their armor.
[01:56:32.896 --> 01:56:33.536]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:56:33.616 --> 01:56:42.521]  I just think, I think California will be a big impact to the country just because... It's a beautiful state with wonderful people and it's a shame it's a globalist hellhole now.
[01:56:43.925 --> 01:56:45.068]  Yes, I definitely agree.
[01:56:45.088 --> 01:56:49.699]  We just need help out here from big people like you, Alex.
[01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:51.023]  I appreciate everything you do for us.
[01:56:51.604 --> 01:56:52.967]  Brother, what else is on your mind, Tito?
[01:56:54.495 --> 01:56:55.135]  Oh, no, nothing.
[01:56:55.175 --> 01:57:02.378]  It's just that I just think a lot of the rest of the country should get behind what's going on in California because we need help, you know, getting these candidates out there.
[01:57:02.398 --> 01:57:02.778]  No, you're right.
[01:57:02.798 --> 01:57:04.959]  A lot of people say build a wall, let it secede.
[01:57:04.999 --> 01:57:08.000]  I've made jokes and said that, but no, if they go down, we all go down.
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:12.362]  We've got to stand with New York and California and other globalist occupied areas.
[01:57:12.382 --> 01:57:13.322]  Beautiful point, Tito.
[01:57:13.362 --> 01:57:14.023]  Thank you so much.
[01:57:15.103 --> 01:57:20.125]  All right, let's go ahead now and talk to Jimmy in Utah.
[01:57:20.165 --> 01:57:20.785]  Jimmy, welcome.
[01:57:22.326 --> 01:57:22.886]  Hey, Alex.
[01:57:24.634 --> 01:57:32.344]  Hey man, I just want to say you're like a, you're a rock star, Alex, and I've been listening to you since like 2008.
[01:57:34.668 --> 01:57:38.211]  And I've got the shirts, I've got all the supplements, man.
[01:57:39.492 --> 01:57:46.098]  I've got the three of the gold bars, the two, I've got the second... Well, your success is our success and our success is your success.
[01:57:46.158 --> 01:57:47.359]  You're the reason we're still here.
[01:57:47.379 --> 01:57:54.965]  I want to thank you, Jimmy, for your support because there's all these new people constantly tuning in and they wouldn't be able to hear all this if it wasn't for you.
[01:57:55.286 --> 01:57:58.228]  So for myself and my family and the whole crew, thank you, brother.
[01:57:58.248 --> 01:57:58.829]  What's on your mind?
[01:57:59.946 --> 01:58:23.753]  Well, I wanted to ask you if you knew anything about, I'm sure you know about the movie 2,000 Mules, but I heard that Tucker had the lady Catherine Englebright on there from To The Vote, and he specifically told her not to mention that movie, and I was wondering why he would do that, because it's such an eye-opening movie that everybody needs to see.
[01:58:23.773 --> 01:58:24.593]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:58:24.693 --> 01:58:26.674]  I meant today to do a whole review of the movie.
[01:58:28.286 --> 01:58:31.188]  And we have a bunch of clips, and I will start the show tomorrow.
[01:58:32.529 --> 01:58:41.355]  I'll do two segments of news tomorrow, and then I will get to all these clips that I dropped the ball and did not cover, that Rob knew last night after we watched it, stayed late, and got these clips.
[01:58:41.395 --> 01:58:43.637]  And I apologize to Rob, too, for not doing this.
[01:58:44.337 --> 01:58:48.761]  But we have ten clips, and I'm going to review the movie tomorrow, and I'm going to talk about it.
[01:58:50.001 --> 01:58:52.463]  I know the inside baseball with Tucker, and I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:58:52.663 --> 01:58:57.247]  He is literally... I'm not going to give away all the inside stuff, but let's just say this.
[01:58:58.174 --> 01:59:01.350]  Tucker did a contract to be paid a fraction.
[01:59:02.583 --> 01:59:05.105]  Of what he is paid, just to have the freedom he has.
[01:59:05.806 --> 01:59:20.538]  But they have certain vetoes, where they come in, and he didn't tell me this, but I know this was happening at Fox, and they said, no 2,000 mules, because then the Democrats will drop all those election lawsuits they have on them, if that happens.
[01:59:20.598 --> 01:59:22.360]  And so, that's what that's about.
[01:59:22.860 --> 01:59:25.502]  Soros comes after Fox anytime they talk about him as well.
[01:59:26.383 --> 01:59:28.365]  And so, Tucker is picking his battles.
[01:59:28.685 --> 01:59:30.427]  I have got Dinesh D'Souza on next week.
[01:59:31.067 --> 01:59:34.151]  I've been trying to get all the other people that are involved on there.
[01:59:34.211 --> 01:59:35.573]  They kind of self-censor themselves.
[01:59:35.613 --> 01:59:36.694]  They're scared of info wars.
[01:59:37.035 --> 01:59:38.056]  People need to stop doing that.
[01:59:38.777 --> 01:59:41.220]  But we're going to do a big push tomorrow for 2,000 Mules.
[01:59:41.641 --> 01:59:42.923]  Tell folks so they can go watch it.
[01:59:44.044 --> 01:59:46.788]  And we commend the Salem Network and others that helped produce it.
[01:59:47.208 --> 01:59:47.328]  Great.
[01:59:47.348 --> 01:59:48.709]  Alex, can I say one more thing?
[01:59:48.588 --> 01:59:52.389]   most important film in decades, totally proves the election fraud and how they did it.
[01:59:52.389 --> 01:59:57.688]   Not electronic, like the Q people said, like I warned Lindell, but totally by mules bringing
[01:59:57.688 --> 01:59:59.868]  in the harvested ballots they had.
[01:59:59.868 --> 02:00:04.507]   That was the admitted plan to stop the red wave that they called the Red Mirage.
[02:00:04.507 --> 02:00:08.028]   And so we will be covering 2,000 mules tomorrow in great detail.
[02:00:08.028 --> 02:00:09.028]  Great.
[02:00:09.028 --> 02:00:11.148]  Alex, can I say one more thing?
[02:00:11.148 --> 02:00:12.148]  Of course.
[02:00:12.148 --> 02:00:13.149]  All right.
[02:00:13.149 --> 02:00:15.068]  I have a probation officer, right?
[02:00:15.068 --> 02:00:19.427]   And I was wearing your, uh, I was wearing let's go the other day when I went in and
[02:00:19.427 --> 02:00:22.788]  seen him and he was, and the info was hat.
[02:00:22.788 --> 02:00:27.748]   And I, when I left, it was like, Hey dude, how do you even watch Alex anymore?
[02:00:27.795 --> 02:00:36.999]  Cause since he got de-platformed, I used to think he was kind of out there, but ever since they de-platformed him, I knew that he must've been right about some things.
[02:00:37.655 --> 02:00:42.118]  And he asked me where to watch it and I told him BandopVideoInfoWars.com.
[02:00:42.018 --> 02:00:47.018]  I thought that was cool because he was my probation officer.
[02:00:47.018 --> 02:00:52.018]   Jimmy, what you did is the most important thing anybody can do. We have all these giant
[02:00:52.018 --> 02:00:55.217]   listenerships out there that don't even know we're still on the air. Everybody just says,
[02:00:55.217 --> 02:01:00.938]   "Alex Jones is still on the air at Band.Video or Battleplan.News and Alex Jones is on radio
[02:01:00.938 --> 02:01:04.637]   stations all over the country. Go out and find it. That's how we do it." Thank you so
[02:01:04.637 --> 02:01:08.177]  much for doing that, Jimmy. All right. Curly.
[02:01:08.177 --> 02:01:18.177]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:01:09.397 --> 02:01:09.877]  Todd.
[02:01:10.878 --> 02:01:11.439]  Jonathan.
[02:01:12.159 --> 02:01:12.960]  Trucker Rodney.
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:13.921]  We're going to your calls.
[02:01:14.041 --> 02:01:16.343]  Bam, bam, bam, with more news on the other side.
[02:01:16.743 --> 02:01:17.324]  Stay with us.
[02:01:17.484 --> 02:01:18.965]  Battleplan.news.
[02:01:19.325 --> 02:01:20.767]  Battleplan.news.
[02:01:21.107 --> 02:01:21.868]  Battleplan.
[02:01:22.849 --> 02:01:24.810]  We are the American resistance.
[02:01:24.850 --> 02:01:26.271]  We are the human resistance.
[02:01:27.079 --> 02:01:27.439]  We're it.
[02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:34.828]  World government, it's here, tyrannical government with a aim to make us poor and uncontrollable, dumbed down and then exterminated.
[02:01:35.649 --> 02:01:36.530]  That's really the reality.
[02:01:37.531 --> 02:01:39.834]  That's not a negative to face the facts.
[02:01:39.894 --> 02:01:43.899]  It's a positive to admit that that negative is there and we're going to deal with it.
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:47.023]  And that's why this broadcast is so important.
[02:01:48.407 --> 02:01:49.768]  I'm going to go back to your phone calls.
[02:01:49.788 --> 02:01:53.470]  I want to just remind listeners that everything we do here is about a symbiotic relationship.
[02:01:54.031 --> 02:02:00.755]  Something that does great things for you and your family, but also keeps us on the air so we can fight these people because we're not funded by the establishment.

[02:03:19.554 --> 02:03:23.856]  We're taking your amazing calls and from different angles, different topics.
[02:03:25.076 --> 02:03:28.059]  Uncensored, unfiltered, raw, on air right now.
[02:03:28.079 --> 02:03:35.484]  And let's go in the order the calls are received and finish up with the callers ahead of Wayne Allyn Root taking over and then the war room in about 70 minutes from now.
[02:03:36.005 --> 02:03:38.006]  Let's talk to Jonathan in Arizona.
[02:03:38.046 --> 02:03:39.007]  Jonathan, welcome, sir.
[02:03:40.668 --> 02:03:41.009]  Hello, sir.
[02:03:41.069 --> 02:03:41.689]  How are you doing?
[02:03:42.069 --> 02:03:45.972]  Man, I am just really blessed and pleased to still be on air despite all the attacks.
[02:03:46.413 --> 02:03:47.794]  That's only because of your support, sir.
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:50.201]  Well, thank you for everything you do.
[02:03:50.241 --> 02:03:50.921]  I appreciate it.
[02:03:51.962 --> 02:04:02.086]  I just wanted to share with you an idea for hopefully a way to save our country and make a big impact without any type of violence and hopefully a way to generate revenue for InfoWars.
[02:04:03.775 --> 02:04:19.602]  And I was thinking that if we all unite and go tax-exempt, you know, because employers can't stop you from going exempt, just go exempt on the federal portion of it, and then keep giving to the state, but at the end of the year it's still fine.
[02:04:20.362 --> 02:04:24.283]  Tax advice, because a lot of it's unconstitutional, but they'll still break your legs, basically.
[02:04:24.764 --> 02:04:34.047]  But that's why we have jonestaxrelief.com that takes you to American Tax Solutions, who's one of the best cut-to-the-chase law firms that just makes a percentage of the money you save.
[02:04:34.367 --> 02:04:41.090]  They then look at your returns, look at your business, look at your job, whether you're a factory worker or a doctor or a billionaire.
[02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:44.351]  Most people are not using the loopholes that are there.
[02:04:45.211 --> 02:04:47.635]  The globalists have those there because they basically don't pay taxes.
[02:04:47.655 --> 02:04:50.720]  Well, why should the general public be paying way more than they should?
[02:04:51.020 --> 02:04:52.122]  That's where everybody should go to.
[02:04:52.623 --> 02:04:55.427]  And it's a great sponsor, by the way, and it's invaluable for everybody.
[02:04:55.748 --> 02:04:56.849]  JonesTaxRelief.com.
[02:04:57.796 --> 02:05:05.143]  Well, that's the, you know, my plan is to still have them go to, uh, Jones Tax, uh, your guy, the sponsor.
[02:05:05.663 --> 02:05:20.276]  But, um, you know, cause at the end of the year, they could set you up on a payment plan or even settle an amount that'll still most likely be less than what you would have paid throughout the year, but it'll make an impact in the sense that they're not getting all that money throughout the year.
[02:05:20.616 --> 02:05:22.158]  And then each year you still file.
[02:05:24.192 --> 02:05:24.832]  Well, that's it.
[02:05:25.232 --> 02:05:28.854]  But, I mean, again, there's more than 20 services they've got.
[02:05:28.894 --> 02:05:35.336]  And what I like is they're not like all these other law firms that make you pay a bunch of money up front and make you wait and then assess.
[02:05:35.356 --> 02:05:37.377]  Those places are just ripping you off.
[02:05:37.657 --> 02:05:39.358]  They cut right to the chase.
[02:05:39.878 --> 02:05:42.219]  And it doesn't matter whether you back tax debts.
[02:05:42.239 --> 02:05:45.560]  It doesn't matter what it is.
[02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:51.182]  They can assess very quickly and in almost every case save you a ton of money right up front.
[02:05:52.188 --> 02:06:03.215]  Yeah, I mean, I guess just at the end of the day, my thinking is that obviously because the Congress, you know, the income tax was passed illegally initially in Congress.
[02:06:03.255 --> 02:06:10.160]  They have a vested interest both in their salary and also the way they siphon money off of all these out-of-country projects.
[02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:12.381]  So they're not going to do anything for us.
[02:06:12.782 --> 02:06:13.162]  That's it.
[02:06:13.202 --> 02:06:14.343]  The tax code is written.
[02:06:15.163 --> 02:06:17.405]  To rip off the middle class, make people poor.
[02:06:17.545 --> 02:06:18.746]  It's for social engineering.
[02:06:18.866 --> 02:06:19.646]  That is admitted.
[02:06:20.187 --> 02:06:23.870]  And anyone that doesn't take advantage of the loopholes is insane.
[02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:24.970]  God bless you, sir.
[02:06:25.010 --> 02:06:26.071]  I appreciate your call, Jonathan.
[02:06:26.672 --> 02:06:28.693]  Let's talk to Todd in Ohio.
[02:06:28.753 --> 02:06:29.314]  Todd, welcome.
[02:06:29.854 --> 02:06:31.355]  Yes, first time caller.
[02:06:31.955 --> 02:06:35.698]  Thank you for saving me from the shot and informing me on the treatments.
[02:06:35.978 --> 02:06:39.941]  I survived the COVID with very little effect because of that.
[02:06:41.262 --> 02:06:47.515]   Have your people look up Zimmer power plant shutdown in Cincinnati this month they're
[02:06:47.515 --> 02:06:53.144]   shutting down a 1.2 billion watt capacity coal-fired power plant and they're
[02:06:53.144 --> 02:06:58.414]   getting ready to do shut down another similar plant in a couple of years and
[02:06:58.414 --> 02:07:02.784]   they're telling you suddenly rolling blockouts and on a power I put a suitcase
[02:07:02.784 --> 02:07:07.855]   generator to power my refrigerator but that's the third thing I want to
[02:07:07.855 --> 02:07:12.225]   say I thought two other things while I was waiting one I'm not a person who's
[02:07:12.225 --> 02:07:17.423]   a confident speaker but I've spoken in front of my village council a couple of
[02:07:17.423 --> 02:07:24.005]   neighboring city councils the Cincinnati City Council County Commissioners
[02:07:22.595 --> 02:07:42.882]   How I did it was you go to your local council and see if there's somebody speaking on a subject that you can support, get to talking to them, and then you can go around with them and support what they're saying, like a Me Too, but you don't have to write the whole big Powerful speech.
[02:07:42.982 --> 02:07:44.603]  You can be there and support.
[02:07:45.663 --> 02:07:47.944]  Or just hold a sign at first.
[02:07:48.244 --> 02:07:53.765]  One of the best ways to have your voice heard is to go to city council or county commissioners or school board and speak.
[02:07:54.185 --> 02:08:06.229]  You'll notice they call the FBI on people that peacefully went and said they didn't want critical race theory or transgenderism taught to five-year-olds in places like Virginia, but they won't send the FBI out when people are screaming and yelling illegally at the houses of federal judges.
[02:08:06.369 --> 02:08:07.189]  It is insane.
[02:08:07.209 --> 02:08:08.249]  Yes.
[02:08:08.689 --> 02:08:15.595]   And the other thing I wanted to mention is that Do you know in Norway they've shut down all the FM radio stations?
[02:08:15.916 --> 02:08:18.140]  And they're going to shut down stations by 2025 in Switzerland?
[02:08:20.242 --> 02:08:23.845]  I know there's a globalist move to get us away from TV and radio that doesn't watch you.
[02:08:24.265 --> 02:08:27.648]  UHF, VHF, AM, shortwave, FM.
[02:08:27.968 --> 02:08:32.492]  They want to get rid of all of it and make everything be digital so they can turn it all off when they want to.
[02:08:32.812 --> 02:08:37.356]  Just like now we don't have enough formula because women stop, you know, using their breasts.
[02:08:37.456 --> 02:08:40.178]  And I'm not knocking women that have to work and do the formula.
[02:08:40.618 --> 02:08:45.703]  The point is, is that this is part of them making humanity artificial and totally under their control.
[02:08:46.463 --> 02:08:49.886]  Cheap shortwave radios that can buy us presents for people.
[02:08:50.416 --> 02:08:53.826]  And give them a frequency list to tune in and they can listen to you.
[02:08:54.611 --> 02:08:59.113]  Wherever they are, and also there are several other truth-based broadcasters on shortwave as well.
[02:08:59.133 --> 02:08:59.513]  That's right.
[02:08:59.533 --> 02:09:03.515]  We're on WWCR like six hours a day, three hours during the day, three hours at night.
[02:09:04.536 --> 02:09:07.397]  And anybody can go there and find the frequencies because they change here and there.
[02:09:07.797 --> 02:09:11.739]  On 100,000 watt shortwaves, we pay $11,000 a month to be on as a world service.
[02:09:12.199 --> 02:09:15.161]  That's where a lot of the money coming in goes is things like that, folks, we don't mention.
[02:09:15.521 --> 02:09:16.941]  Thank you, Todd.
[02:09:17.842 --> 02:09:19.443]  Curly in the great state of Texas.
[02:09:19.463 --> 02:09:20.143]  Curly, welcome.
[02:09:21.806 --> 02:09:22.807]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:09:22.827 --> 02:09:23.687]  How are you doing, sir?
[02:09:23.807 --> 02:09:23.987]  Good.
[02:09:24.027 --> 02:09:25.008]  You're our telegunner today.
[02:09:25.128 --> 02:09:26.889]  Last caller before Wayne Ellyn Ripp takes over.
[02:09:27.810 --> 02:09:28.230]  Excellent.
[02:09:28.290 --> 02:09:28.710]  Okay.
[02:09:28.791 --> 02:09:33.774]  First off, I've been listening to you since the final edition on B93.3.
[02:09:34.134 --> 02:09:36.676]  That's right.
[02:09:36.716 --> 02:09:38.277]  So you've been listening a long time.
[02:09:39.237 --> 02:09:39.678]  Yes, sir.
[02:09:41.198 --> 02:09:43.079]  Weather permitting, actually.
[02:09:43.099 --> 02:10:04.231]  But anyhow, so the question I'm kind of curious about, if the vaccinations are genetically modified, which they are, when an individual winds up with an injection or multiple injections, do they not become the property of the vaccination company that manufactures those things?
[02:10:04.966 --> 02:10:07.688]  That's what they're technically arguing, is you're now a mutant.
[02:10:08.248 --> 02:10:11.671]  Now they're passing laws around the world that you, quote, can't discriminate against mutants.
[02:10:11.711 --> 02:10:15.154]  So, they're getting us ready for clones, human-animal hybrids.
[02:10:15.754 --> 02:10:23.300]  All this is already going on, and now they're just normalizing this whole artificial world they're rolling out, where normal human life is not sustainable.
[02:10:24.581 --> 02:10:25.601]  Yes, sir, absolutely.
[02:10:25.681 --> 02:10:26.862]  Well, blessings to you.
[02:10:26.882 --> 02:10:33.087]  This is the first time I've been able to call and speak with you through these many years, but it's been a pleasure.
[02:10:33.287 --> 02:10:37.051]   And if you get over here, About 100 miles west of you at some point.
[02:10:37.271 --> 02:10:39.052]  I'd love to shake your hand.
[02:10:39.092 --> 02:10:40.273]  Love to shake your hand, Curly.
[02:10:41.014 --> 02:10:41.795]  Let me ask you this.
[02:10:42.295 --> 02:10:44.357]  So, have you been listening since I did the final edition?
[02:10:44.397 --> 02:10:44.737]  That's like 98, 99?
[02:10:44.837 --> 02:10:45.898]  No, sir.
[02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:50.882]  That was actually 94, I believe.
[02:10:50.902 --> 02:10:56.507]  Well, I wasn't on air until about 95, but you've definitely been listening.
[02:10:56.787 --> 02:10:58.448]  You've been listening a long time, brother.
[02:10:59.569 --> 02:10:59.909]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:59.929 --> 02:11:11.981]   It would have been 95 then because I made a career change and it was just prior to my career change that I started listening to you over here about 100 miles west of you.
[02:11:12.482 --> 02:11:16.145]  B-93 would come in when the weather conditions was just right.
[02:11:16.525 --> 02:11:16.946]  That's right.
[02:11:17.026 --> 02:11:19.328]  Charlie, we love you and thank you so much.
[02:11:19.768 --> 02:11:25.453]  I'm going to do five more minutes on the abortion issue and how it ties into January 6th and how the Globals are planning a strike.
[02:11:25.734 --> 02:11:26.955]  Then Wayne Allyn Root takes over.
[02:11:28.410 --> 02:11:30.071]  The great Jimmy Lee be bringing us in.
[02:11:30.091 --> 02:11:32.351]  Wayne Ellen Root takes over in T-minus six minutes.
[02:11:33.392 --> 02:11:34.732]  Now let me hit this important area.
[02:11:36.833 --> 02:11:44.455]  Thousands of articles a day demonize the American people saying anybody that supports borders or doesn't want to take forced shots or questions elections is a terrorist.
[02:11:45.819 --> 02:11:48.039]  And just absolute hyping of this everywhere.
[02:11:48.059 --> 02:11:50.400]  And now we've got this out of the Gateway Pundit.
[02:11:50.780 --> 02:11:51.420]  Pure evil!
[02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:57.641]  Biden's DOJ is threatening January 6th defendants with life in prison after walking inside U.S.
[02:11:57.661 --> 02:11:58.862]  Capitol taking pictures.
[02:11:59.622 --> 02:12:10.464]  And the whole article lays out how they're now openly telling defendants that they may just charge them basically with terrorism, with sedition, and try to keep them in jail for the rest of their lives.
[02:12:11.483 --> 02:12:15.466]  Evil is walking the halls of government and weak men and women are too afraid to speak out.
[02:12:16.206 --> 02:12:18.868]  And the whole article lays this important.
[02:12:19.670 --> 02:12:25.909]   information on what seditious conspiracy means. Meanwhile, actual insurrection, Chicago mayor
[02:12:25.909 --> 02:12:31.829]   calls to arms close quote over Supreme Court. Mayor Lightfoot has issued a call to arms in
[02:12:31.829 --> 02:12:36.949]   response to leaked ruling via Supreme Court, which would overturn Roe v. Wade, implying that the U.S.
[02:12:36.949 --> 02:12:44.069]   S.C. should come for the LBGTQ rights next. My friend, she goes on, the Supreme Court is coming
[02:12:44.069 --> 02:12:50.548]   for us next. The moment has to be the call to arms, she wrote in the tweet. And again,
[02:12:50.548 --> 02:12:53.429]   that's a figure of speech, but if I said that, that'd arrest me.
[02:12:53.712 --> 02:12:57.033]  McConnell says national abortion ban possible.
[02:12:59.814 --> 02:13:00.434]  In a statement.
[02:13:02.815 --> 02:13:06.777]  We now have a leftist activist threatening Supreme Court justices and attacking Christianity.
[02:13:07.497 --> 02:13:10.658]  You know all about this, but it's just getting out of control.
[02:13:11.019 --> 02:13:15.961]  Satanic Temple will argue abortion is a religious ritual in legal challenge.
[02:13:17.101 --> 02:13:18.782]  We live in a society, says the meme.
[02:13:19.909 --> 02:13:30.855]  Where homosexuals lecture us on morals, transvestites lecture us on human biology, baby killers lecture us on human rights, and socialists lecture us on economics.
[02:13:31.296 --> 02:13:37.559]  And remember when Chuckie Schumer said that they would come at the Supreme Court justices that they had reaped the whirlwind and they better watch it.
[02:13:38.300 --> 02:13:40.661]  Now that's protected speech, but it's right on the edge.
[02:13:41.621 --> 02:13:48.970]   But it's nothing compared To what they're planning in the future.
[02:13:49.010 --> 02:13:49.630]  Look at this meme.
[02:13:49.971 --> 02:13:51.071]  First wave feminism.
[02:13:51.871 --> 02:13:52.911]  We want to be equal to men.
[02:13:53.771 --> 02:13:54.732]  Second wave feminism.
[02:13:54.792 --> 02:13:55.792]  We don't need men.
[02:13:56.292 --> 02:13:57.392]  Third wave feminism.
[02:13:57.472 --> 02:13:58.592]  We are men.
[02:14:00.073 --> 02:14:02.173]  Certainly says it all.
[02:14:02.493 --> 02:14:03.833]  Meanwhile, I see these stories everywhere.
[02:14:04.113 --> 02:14:07.674]  Feminist bakes sourdough bread using her own vaginal yeast.
[02:14:08.534 --> 02:14:09.315]  All of it gross.
[02:14:09.935 --> 02:14:10.995]  All of it degrading women.
[02:14:11.695 --> 02:14:16.356]  It just goes on and on and on from there.
[02:14:18.144 --> 02:14:23.773]  I don't have time to get to it, but this video of Trudeau, maybe we can roll it, where he couldn't even run a flag up a flagpole.
[02:14:24.193 --> 02:14:25.776]  These people are paper tigers.
[02:14:26.457 --> 02:14:33.046]  And we've got to start calling them on it and stop letting them order us around and thinking for ourselves is the only way out of this.
[02:14:35.452 --> 02:14:38.753]  They're planning big stuff in the next 182 days out of the midterms.
[02:14:38.773 --> 02:14:44.814]  They've said the number one terror threat is Christian conservatives and evil white people and people that question election fraud.
[02:14:44.874 --> 02:14:49.054]  Tomorrow we'll be covering clips and analysis out of 2000 Mules.
[02:14:49.094 --> 02:14:50.895]  Meant to get to it today, but had so much going on.
[02:14:51.295 --> 02:14:55.096]  We'll start the show with that tomorrow, I promise, and really give it a big push in analysis.
[02:14:55.116 --> 02:15:01.217]  The Dinesh D'Souza and others are scheduled to be on the show next week, but that is such an important film as well.
[02:15:01.757 --> 02:15:05.978]   But just remember, that all of this flows out of globalism
[02:15:05.978 --> 02:15:10.378]   and the corrupt corporations that are anti-free market and want to make us poor so they can dictate
[02:15:10.378 --> 02:15:12.859]  the terms of our surrender.
[02:15:12.859 --> 02:15:18.939]   And that's why being successful, being positive, being vibrant, being leaders, not taking it lying down,
[02:15:18.939 --> 02:15:24.179]   but taking it as a challenge of like climbing a mountain will make us stronger in the end
[02:15:24.179 --> 02:15:25.298]  because they can't break our will.
[02:15:25.298 --> 02:15:29.699]   So pray to God to strengthen your will in the sermon and pray to God to rise you up as a leader,
[02:15:29.699 --> 02:15:32.059]  not just to help yourself, but help others.
[02:15:32.059 --> 02:15:33.738]  And thank you all for your support and what you do.
[02:15:33.738 --> 02:15:39.418]   Now, everybody, have you told your friends and family, your neighbors or strangers about InfoWorks.com today?
[02:15:39.303 --> 02:15:40.905]  Have you told them about The War Room at 3 p.m.?
[02:15:40.925 --> 02:15:50.213]  Have you told them that Wayne Allen Root, who's a fireball of knowledge, best-selling author, talk show host, researcher, is about to take over on the other side, so strap yourselves in.
[02:15:50.113 --> 02:15:55.752]   And then in 55 minutes, the great Owen Schroer with the War Room, Infowars.com/show.

[02:17:01.902 --> 02:17:04.902]  and all of you that donated, we salute you and thank you.
[02:17:04.902 --> 02:17:07.661]  (dramatic music)
[02:17:07.661 --> 02:17:13.802]  All right, Wayne, Alan Roots with you for this hour.
[02:17:14.511 --> 02:17:16.172]  Alex Jones, thank you for having me on.
[02:17:16.212 --> 02:17:17.633]  I see my tie is a little bit off.
[02:17:18.033 --> 02:17:19.213]  We'll work on that.
[02:17:19.294 --> 02:17:19.954]  We'll work on that.
[02:17:20.826 --> 02:17:24.089]  In any case, let me tell you what I've got in store for you today.
[02:17:24.149 --> 02:17:24.730]  Lots of things.
[02:17:24.770 --> 02:17:28.974]  Let me start with a little personal gratification.
[02:17:29.054 --> 02:17:33.398]  I feel great that I wrote a book called The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[02:17:34.409 --> 02:17:38.370]  And it was a number one bestseller in, I don't know, about 20 categories at Amazon.
[02:17:38.410 --> 02:17:41.791]  It's been on and off a top bestseller for the last six months.
[02:17:41.851 --> 02:17:43.952]  Since it came out, it was number one.
[02:17:44.412 --> 02:17:49.153]  And the point of the book is to go after the woke corporations.
[02:17:49.693 --> 02:18:04.867]   And I listed 116 companies that I did thousands of hours of research and found the 116 most woke companies that Accept our money, get rich on our money, and treat us like garbage.
[02:18:05.467 --> 02:18:08.148]  Conservatives, Christians, deplorables, patriots.
[02:18:08.568 --> 02:18:10.608]  They take our money and they treat us like garbage.
[02:18:11.229 --> 02:18:14.449]  And I went out with those thousands of hours of research and hired a team.
[02:18:15.550 --> 02:18:27.413]  And that team found the phone numbers, the email addresses, the social media addresses, the physical address of each one of these companies, their CEOs, and their board of directors.
[02:18:27.453 --> 02:18:28.753]  And I listed it in this book.
[02:18:29.783 --> 02:18:32.045]  And so it came out, I don't know, about eight months ago.
[02:18:32.445 --> 02:18:33.926]  I must have written it about a year ago.
[02:18:34.407 --> 02:18:35.247]  Who's on that list?
[02:18:35.808 --> 02:18:36.988]  Right at the top, Disney.
[02:18:37.329 --> 02:18:37.889]  How did I know?
[02:18:37.909 --> 02:18:38.670]  I just knew.
[02:18:38.690 --> 02:18:40.351]  Thousands of hours of research.
[02:18:40.691 --> 02:18:41.451]  Who's near the top?
[02:18:41.552 --> 02:18:42.112]  Netflix.
[02:18:42.592 --> 02:18:43.433]  Who's near the top?
[02:18:43.893 --> 02:18:44.414]  Target.
[02:18:45.094 --> 02:18:47.436]  So let me start with what happened after the book came out.
[02:18:47.876 --> 02:18:50.498]  The great Patriot protest, the boycott book comes out.
[02:18:51.098 --> 02:18:56.222]  And over the last few months, Disney has lost over $60 billion in market share.
[02:18:56.824 --> 02:19:00.988]  Netflix has lost over $50 billion in market share.
[02:19:01.548 --> 02:19:04.671]  And now, who wants more of the pain?
[02:19:05.092 --> 02:19:07.974]  Who is into S&M and wants more of the pain?
[02:19:08.535 --> 02:19:26.103]   Target the clothing store, the department store that sells more than just clothing, but they sell all kinds of junk, low-end junk, and target Is now proud to announce their collaboration with a queer company.
[02:19:26.143 --> 02:19:27.785]  Now they're the ones who use that word, not me.
[02:19:28.465 --> 02:19:29.867]  To me, queer is a terrible word.
[02:19:29.987 --> 02:19:31.108]  I would never use that word.
[02:19:31.993 --> 02:19:33.574]  To me, queer is a bad word.
[02:19:34.014 --> 02:19:37.096]  You know, it's like when you use a bad word for African-Americans.
[02:19:37.116 --> 02:19:38.737]  You use that N-word, your life's over.
[02:19:39.097 --> 02:19:40.018]  Your career's over.
[02:19:40.438 --> 02:19:42.919]  To me, queer is a terrible, poisonous word.
[02:19:43.260 --> 02:19:44.160]  Gays love it now.
[02:19:44.740 --> 02:19:46.762]  Everything's about, you know, I'm queer.
[02:19:46.982 --> 02:19:47.562]  She's queer.
[02:19:47.722 --> 02:19:48.222]  It's queer.
[02:19:48.563 --> 02:19:49.783]  We're a queer company.
[02:19:50.123 --> 02:19:51.424]  We stand behind queers.
[02:19:51.964 --> 02:19:53.846]  So they're the ones who like the word, not me.
[02:19:55.386 --> 02:20:02.722]   And so the announcement is that Target is in bed with a queer company That features, and I don't care if you're gay.
[02:20:03.243 --> 02:20:05.149]  I've never cared if someone's gay.
[02:20:05.650 --> 02:20:06.773]  I come from New York City.
[02:20:07.521 --> 02:20:14.907]  I come from Hollywood where I was a big game show host, and a talk show host, and an anchorman, and it doesn't bother me if you're gay.
[02:20:15.407 --> 02:20:27.857]  What bothers me is the transgender brainwashing, and trying to convince kids in kindergarten that they should switch their sex, and turning on the TV set, and everybody's gay!
[02:20:28.378 --> 02:20:35.684]  Everybody's transgender, and everybody's minority, as if there's no white people left in the world, and no straight white males.
[02:20:36.344 --> 02:20:43.768]  It's all being shoved down our throat in the most massive propaganda brainwashing campaign the world's ever known.
[02:20:44.188 --> 02:20:45.769]  And it's not for equality.
[02:20:45.789 --> 02:20:47.410]  I don't mind equality.
[02:20:47.910 --> 02:20:49.531]  It's for superiority.
[02:20:50.151 --> 02:20:55.314]  Every word that comes out of liberals' mouths is that white, straight males are bad.
[02:20:55.714 --> 02:21:05.317]   We belong in some sort of Yes!
[02:21:05.657 --> 02:21:07.418]  Yes!
[02:21:07.438 --> 02:21:10.379]  I love transgenders!
[02:21:10.759 --> 02:21:13.160]  They should make up the entire military force!
[02:21:13.780 --> 02:21:14.821]  That's what they're looking for!
[02:21:15.381 --> 02:21:16.641]  Every child in school!
[02:21:17.042 --> 02:21:18.402]  Every boy should be a girl!
[02:21:18.762 --> 02:21:20.043]  Every girl should be a boy!
[02:21:20.063 --> 02:21:21.483]  Women should be proud!
[02:21:22.063 --> 02:21:23.104]  They want us to say that!
[02:21:23.712 --> 02:21:24.392]  It's sick.
[02:21:24.932 --> 02:21:26.353]  It's mental illness.
[02:21:26.933 --> 02:21:29.153]  If you want to be gay, if you're born gay, great.
[02:21:29.433 --> 02:21:31.274]  Hey, I've nothing against you.
[02:21:31.894 --> 02:21:51.839]  But Target is now partnering with a queer company to feature binders and packing briefs from a company called Tomboy X. And the photo they're showing is two incredibly large sized women with their arms around each other in a brace and tattoos up and down their arms.
[02:21:53.106 --> 02:21:56.868]  Let me explain to you what binders and packing briefs are.
[02:21:56.888 --> 02:22:00.771]  Because if you don't know, it doesn't surprise me.
[02:22:01.431 --> 02:22:02.072]  I didn't know.
[02:22:02.632 --> 02:22:04.453]  I've never heard of things like this.
[02:22:04.913 --> 02:22:12.878]  It's an entire country that's gone mental illness, loco, crazy, nutso, the whole country.
[02:22:13.999 --> 02:22:15.420]  Do you know what binders are?
[02:22:16.149 --> 02:22:18.830]  When girls want to be boys, they can't have breasts.
[02:22:19.390 --> 02:22:27.273]  So instead of wearing a bra that pushes your breasts up and attracts normal men, you wear a binder that ties your breasts in.
[02:22:27.793 --> 02:22:31.535]  So you look like a man that has no breasts, even though you're a girl.
[02:22:32.202 --> 02:22:33.903]  Do you know what packing briefs are?
[02:22:34.404 --> 02:22:35.465]  I'll bet you can guess.
[02:22:36.045 --> 02:22:38.027]  It's for boys who want to be girls.
[02:22:38.527 --> 02:22:41.970]  If you're a girl, you wouldn't have an appendage sticking out.
[02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:43.131]  You wouldn't have a penis, right?
[02:22:43.892 --> 02:22:50.838]  So they have you put on packing briefs that are so tight, like binders, pulling a woman's breasts in so you look more like a man.
[02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:55.672]  They're pulling your penis in so it looks like you're a girl and you're not packing.
[02:22:55.972 --> 02:22:56.252]  Get it?
[02:22:56.833 --> 02:22:58.474]  So those are packing briefs.
[02:22:58.914 --> 02:22:59.894]  Those are binders.
[02:23:00.375 --> 02:23:05.297]  And Target is proud to be selling that to the transgender generation.
[02:23:05.957 --> 02:23:07.098]  Now, here's my point.
[02:23:07.758 --> 02:23:08.219]  Oh, God.
[02:23:08.539 --> 02:23:09.259]  Look at that picture.
[02:23:09.579 --> 02:23:10.520]  Here's my point.
[02:23:10.740 --> 02:23:12.561]  I'm going to vomit, I swear, on national TV.
[02:23:14.133 --> 02:23:21.067]  Just to show you again how open-minded I am, I was the libertarian, I was a presidential candidate in 2008.
[02:23:22.310 --> 02:23:26.053]  And I campaigned all over the country, went to 50 Libertarian state conventions.
[02:23:26.073 --> 02:23:27.394]  I've been a Republican my whole life.
[02:23:27.894 --> 02:23:41.344]  But for one year, I decided to try and win the Libertarian presidential nomination because I was so angry at George W. Bush, who I thought was one of the worst presidents ever, and a Republican so bad, he convinced everyone to become a Democrat.
[02:23:41.604 --> 02:23:42.285]  And I was right.
[02:23:42.345 --> 02:23:43.726]  It led to the election of Obama.
[02:23:44.206 --> 02:23:46.128]  That led to the ruination of America.
[02:23:46.969 --> 02:23:58.341]  George W. Bush was such a lousy president, he led to us, the country, embracing Obama and that led to the ruination of America and that set us down the road to destroying this country where we are now.
[02:23:59.551 --> 02:24:06.217]  So I ran for the Libertarian presidential nomination, finished second, almost won the nomination, lost out to Bob Barr.
[02:24:06.657 --> 02:24:09.219]  Bob Barr chose me as his vice presidential running mate.
[02:24:09.599 --> 02:24:19.748]  Congressman Bob Barr, Georgia, who led the impeachment of Clinton and a very credible, well-known, high-profile congressman out of Georgia picked me to be his VP nominee.
[02:24:20.188 --> 02:24:23.971]  And I traveled the country on the presidential ticket of the Libertarian Party.
[02:24:25.713 --> 02:24:31.312]   And I tell you this because They asked me to go to the gay parade in San Francisco.
[02:24:32.023 --> 02:24:50.597]  Wayne, the macho straight guy who's never been around a gay parade in my life and never planned to be, was told I was the guy to sit in the convertible and drive in the parade representing the Libertarian Party and wave to the gay crowd who was making out with each other and hugging each other.
[02:24:50.617 --> 02:24:58.503]  And I dutifully did it and enjoyed myself and had a good time and was very nice, as I always am, to everybody.
[02:24:58.903 --> 02:25:00.264]  All my life I've been nice to everyone.
[02:25:00.284 --> 02:25:04.786]  No matter what I'm thinking inside, you're all crazy, you're all nuts, you're all radical.
[02:25:05.106 --> 02:25:05.646]  I was nice.
[02:25:06.126 --> 02:25:07.707]  I was nice to every gay person I met.
[02:25:08.067 --> 02:25:09.368]  I have no problem with gay people.
[02:25:09.888 --> 02:25:16.931]  I have a problem with transgender brainwashing in kindergarten through 12th grade, let alone 3rd grade.
[02:25:17.471 --> 02:25:21.393]  But I have no problem if you want to be gay and hug each other and kiss each other, you go do it.
[02:25:22.136 --> 02:25:26.140]  So I sat in that car and I waved at the gay parade in San Francisco to the whole crowd.
[02:25:26.621 --> 02:25:29.463]  I've been a pro-gay conservative Republican my whole life.
[02:25:29.864 --> 02:25:31.005]  If you want to be gay, be gay.
[02:25:31.045 --> 02:25:32.326]  If you want to get married, get married.
[02:25:32.747 --> 02:25:33.427]  Who cares?
[02:25:34.128 --> 02:25:35.790]  Two women want to get married, go get married.
[02:25:35.810 --> 02:25:36.290]  I don't care.
[02:25:36.310 --> 02:25:37.792]  Two guys want to get married.
[02:25:37.812 --> 02:25:40.434]  Whatever you do in the privacy of your bedroom you want to do, good.
[02:25:41.781 --> 02:26:00.111]  When you want to brainwash my children and convince them to mutilate their genitals at an age where they have no mental ability to make lifelong decisions, I draw a line when Joe Biden said the MAGA movement is the most extreme movement in America's history.
[02:26:00.211 --> 02:26:04.513]  No, the Democrat Party is the most extreme movement in Democrat history.
[02:26:04.994 --> 02:26:06.514]  Everything I believe in is normal.
[02:26:06.855 --> 02:26:08.415]  Everything you believe in is normal.
[02:26:08.856 --> 02:26:10.036]  It's God's will.
[02:26:10.116 --> 02:26:10.877]  It's the Bible.
[02:26:11.457 --> 02:26:12.859]  This is abnormal.
[02:26:13.820 --> 02:26:21.991]  Packing briefs and binders for girls who want to make believe they're boys and boys who want to make believe they're girls?
[02:26:22.472 --> 02:26:26.838]  So folks, it's time to pick up a copy of my book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[02:26:27.198 --> 02:26:29.041]  I've got all the contact information.
[02:26:29.850 --> 02:26:32.792]  Disney, we took care of, and let's keep taking care of them.
[02:26:33.212 --> 02:26:34.413]  Boycott them and starve them.
[02:26:34.874 --> 02:26:36.435]  Target is the new Disney.
[02:26:36.995 --> 02:26:39.157]  Target Corporation is the new Disney.
[02:26:39.557 --> 02:26:41.358]  All the contact information's in the book.
[02:26:41.658 --> 02:26:42.299]  How did I know?
[02:26:42.319 --> 02:26:48.043]  I just knew who was gonna go crazy, and be radical, and be liberal, and be woke, and be communist.
[02:26:48.383 --> 02:26:49.064]  And I was right.
[02:26:49.544 --> 02:26:50.705]  Target's the new Disney.
[02:26:51.045 --> 02:26:52.026]  Make them our target.
[02:26:52.926 --> 02:26:55.448]  Destroy their ability to be woke.
[02:26:56.289 --> 02:26:57.349]  Alright, way down the route.
[02:26:57.410 --> 02:26:59.251]  There's so many things to talk about, I don't know where to begin.
[02:27:00.029 --> 02:27:02.350]  So let me begin with a little intro as to who I am.
[02:27:02.430 --> 02:27:06.092]  I opened the show with my book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[02:27:06.112 --> 02:27:07.173]  You just saw that on the screen.
[02:27:07.193 --> 02:27:08.454]  I'm Wayne Allyn Root.

[02:27:21.401 --> 02:27:22.141]  How do you find it?

[02:27:33.690 --> 02:27:35.010]  And everything starts there.
[02:27:35.070 --> 02:27:36.031]  I've got my radio show.
[02:27:36.051 --> 02:27:40.152]  There's a button right near the top that says listen to the radio show live now.
[02:27:40.612 --> 02:27:42.373]  And when it's on the air, 6 to 9 p.m.

[02:27:48.978 --> 02:27:56.760]  You've got a button up, Root for America, to listen to my podcast, War Raw, seven days a week, including the weekend edition that's on video.

[02:28:10.807 --> 02:28:12.588]  These are the stories you need to know.

[02:28:21.353 --> 02:28:24.595]  And then we've got my email, wayneroot at gmail.com.
[02:28:24.996 --> 02:28:26.136]  I love to hear from you.
[02:28:26.196 --> 02:28:34.441]   And on the Alex Jones Show, when I give out this email, they just pour in because you You guys are the greatest engaged audience.
[02:28:34.921 --> 02:28:36.802]  You know the country's being ripped apart.
[02:28:37.182 --> 02:28:41.183]  You know it's a purposeful, intentional attack on America.
[02:28:41.584 --> 02:28:42.524]  It's not a mistake.
[02:28:42.944 --> 02:28:45.045]  And you know that we've got to all stick together.
[02:28:45.385 --> 02:28:47.085]  So the emails I get are amazing.
[02:28:47.106 --> 02:28:48.166]  You're all salt of the earth.
[02:28:48.626 --> 02:28:50.827]  Blue collar, middle class, working class people.
[02:28:51.207 --> 02:28:56.569]  The typical Trump voter who they're trying to take the country away from and destroy your life.
[02:28:57.069 --> 02:28:58.592]  Wade Root at gmail.com.
[02:28:58.672 --> 02:29:09.527]  I love to hear from you, and you can sign up at rootforamerica.com and join my mailing list, and I'll send you all my columns, all my videos, everything's at rootforamerica.com.
[02:29:10.789 --> 02:29:12.211]  There is some hope in America.
[02:29:12.271 --> 02:29:13.213]  It's not just negative.
[02:29:13.712 --> 02:29:16.636]  And that's the thing we hear so much negative and it's bad.
[02:29:17.117 --> 02:29:22.704]  This attack is awful and intentional purposeful attack on America, but it isn't all bad.
[02:29:22.784 --> 02:29:23.685]  Some of the news is good.
[02:29:24.106 --> 02:29:28.592]  Here was my most recent column meet the greatest GOP salesman in history.
[02:29:29.392 --> 02:29:31.433]  I've been a Republican for a long, long time.
[02:29:31.994 --> 02:29:48.823]  I'm only 60 years old, but I've been a true blue Republican for 57 years since 1964, when I was three years old handing out political campaign literature for Barry Goldwater in my father's arms in Mount Vernon, New York at a train station.
[02:29:49.264 --> 02:29:51.565]  So I've been a Republican a long time.
[02:29:51.985 --> 02:29:54.667]  So I think I know a thing or two about the Republican party.
[02:29:55.365 --> 02:29:57.947]  So who is the greatest Republican salesman of all time?
[02:29:58.387 --> 02:30:00.228]  You can make the argument it's Ronald Reagan.
[02:30:00.708 --> 02:30:16.518]  He was my hero and he was certainly one of the great presidents in the history of America and certainly one of the greatest economic presidents who took Jimmy Carter's economic nightmare and disaster and turned it into the greatest economic recovery in the history of the world in just two short years.
[02:30:16.878 --> 02:30:17.278]  Amazing.
[02:30:17.739 --> 02:30:21.101]  And he turned a whole generation of young people into proud Republicans.
[02:30:21.161 --> 02:30:22.702]  Thank you, Ronald Reagan.
[02:30:22.722 --> 02:30:23.122]  We love you.
[02:30:24.063 --> 02:30:25.224]  A strong argument could be made.
[02:30:25.284 --> 02:30:26.005]  It's Donald Trump.
[02:30:26.426 --> 02:30:42.124]  He not only upset Hillary Clinton in what was probably the biggest upset in the history of American presidential politics while she was spying on him and knew everything he was going to do and knew his campaign plans and knew his entire speeches because she was spying on him like Watergate.
[02:30:42.484 --> 02:30:43.125]  He still beat her!
[02:30:43.866 --> 02:30:47.288]  And then in 2020, he got the most votes of any Republican in history.
[02:30:47.708 --> 02:30:49.729]  He got the most votes of any sitting president in history.
[02:30:50.109 --> 02:30:56.552]  He got the most new votes of any president in his second run for office in history, 11 million new voters.
[02:30:57.192 --> 02:30:58.973]  And so Donald Trump is amazing.
[02:30:59.373 --> 02:31:06.276]   He also, this year, 2022, has endorsed 55 Republican candidates in primaries around the country.
[02:31:06.657 --> 02:31:07.917]  His record's 55-0.
[02:31:08.658 --> 02:31:09.558]  He's an amazing guy.
[02:31:10.019 --> 02:31:11.479]  So it's not the GOP anymore.
[02:31:11.840 --> 02:31:13.240]  It's the DJT.
[02:31:13.580 --> 02:31:15.361]  The Donald J. Trump Party.
[02:31:15.662 --> 02:31:16.982]  Donald John Trump Party.
[02:31:17.703 --> 02:31:19.384]  Now that's a great salesman.
[02:31:19.404 --> 02:31:20.464]  That's an epic salesman.
[02:31:20.804 --> 02:31:22.285]  That's a legendary salesman.
[02:31:22.685 --> 02:31:23.606]  Trump is the GOAT.
[02:31:24.026 --> 02:31:25.207]  The greatest of all time.
[02:31:25.267 --> 02:31:26.247]  I've called him that before.
[02:31:27.048 --> 02:31:29.009]  But in the end, I still gotta argue.
[02:31:29.645 --> 02:31:33.968]  The single greatest GOP salesman in history is Joe Biden.
[02:31:34.708 --> 02:31:44.394]  This guy has done more to convert the whole America into Republicans and have a distaste for Democrats than anybody could ever hope to do.
[02:31:45.615 --> 02:31:50.218]  Never has anyone done a better job in 18 months to destroy a country.
[02:31:50.638 --> 02:31:57.442]  He's turned the greatest country in world history into a combination of basket case and dumpster fire.
[02:31:58.146 --> 02:31:59.448]  The economy is imploding.
[02:32:00.068 --> 02:32:07.357]  Negative gross domestic product, meaning negative economic growth, over 20% real inflation on the ground.
[02:32:07.738 --> 02:32:09.039]  Forget the 8% number.
[02:32:09.380 --> 02:32:15.227]  The real inflation figure, 20% personal incomes year to year, down by over 20%.
[02:32:18.084 --> 02:32:22.127]  Manufacturing already the numbers show we're entering recession.
[02:32:22.667 --> 02:32:26.330]  Worker productivity the lowest since 1947.
[02:32:26.770 --> 02:32:32.714]  And the stock market crashing day after day after day for six weeks now.
[02:32:33.075 --> 02:32:34.836]  Last week one of the worst weeks in history.
[02:32:35.256 --> 02:32:38.258]  A couple days last week among the worst days in history.
[02:32:38.599 --> 02:32:40.560]  And last I looked today it was crashing again.
[02:32:40.940 --> 02:32:42.602]  It was up 500 points then it was down 500.
[02:32:43.542 --> 02:32:49.346]  So, I have not looked in an hour, so forgive me, I'm on national TV, but last I looked it was crashing again.
[02:32:50.246 --> 02:32:56.550]  We are suffering from massive hyperinflation, starting to feel like Zimbabwe meets the Weimar Republic.
[02:32:57.030 --> 02:33:02.954]  The middle class is being destroyed by gas and grocery prices, and it's only going to get much, much worse.
[02:33:03.607 --> 02:33:19.035]  Big cities in the USA look like Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the atomic bomb was dropped because of soft on crime policies by Democrats and Democrat DAs backed by that communist traitor George Soros.
[02:33:20.726 --> 02:33:30.851]  Cities are filled now under Biden with crime and violent crime and murder and homeless bums in tent cities and drug needles and poop and pee.
[02:33:31.732 --> 02:33:33.913]  It's unimaginable what he's done to our country.
[02:33:34.293 --> 02:33:36.915]  And retail stores are being robbed left and right.
[02:33:37.335 --> 02:33:40.536]  And then there's Biden's insane immigration policies.
[02:33:40.597 --> 02:33:46.480]  The whole world's coming in because he invited them in and the border is wide open and he's getting rid of what is it, Title 42.
[02:33:46.620 --> 02:33:47.720]  It's a disaster.
[02:33:49.683 --> 02:33:55.459]  And the crime wave they're going to bring and the welfare they want will bankrupt this country and kill someone close to you.
[02:33:56.121 --> 02:34:00.462]  I haven't even mentioned the thousand pound elephant in the room, Biden's vaccine mandates.
[02:34:00.962 --> 02:34:04.663]  Millions of workers had to be forced vaccinated or lose their jobs.
[02:34:05.023 --> 02:34:11.245]  And the result is skyrocketing death and disability and crippling injuries across the USA.
[02:34:11.685 --> 02:34:13.526]  Life insurance companies are in a panic.
[02:34:13.886 --> 02:34:19.928]  They report non-COVID deaths up 40% or higher since the vaccine mandate.
[02:34:20.328 --> 02:34:26.870]   And we're still the millennial death rate, a staggering 84% up Since the vaccines!
[02:34:27.990 --> 02:34:50.636]  And if Biden didn't kill your job with his awful economy, or kill your income with his awful inflation, or literally kill you with the vaccine, now he's got us on the verge of World War 3 with Russia threatening nuclear annihilation, and I can almost guarantee you, China will be invading Taiwan any day now, which will be a disaster for the United States and pull us into World War 3.
[02:34:50.956 --> 02:34:53.457]  I'll finish this commentary when we get back.
[02:34:53.897 --> 02:34:57.318]  The world's greatest GOP salesman is Joe Biden.
[02:34:57.658 --> 02:34:59.699]  And I'll finish up by proving my point.
[02:35:00.159 --> 02:35:01.199]  Thank you, Joe Biden.
[02:35:01.219 --> 02:35:02.019]  God bless you.
[02:35:02.299 --> 02:35:04.640]  You're the best thing that ever happened to the GOP.
[02:35:04.660 --> 02:35:08.901]  You're convincing everyone to leave the Democratic Party and become a Republican.
[02:35:09.321 --> 02:35:15.143]  The only bad news is you're the worst thing that's ever happened to our beloved United States of America.
[02:35:15.503 --> 02:35:16.023]  Wayne Root.
[02:35:16.403 --> 02:35:18.024]  WayneRoot at gmail.com.
[02:35:18.364 --> 02:35:20.304]  RootForAmerica.com.
[02:35:20.324 --> 02:35:23.185]  The book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[02:35:23.972 --> 02:35:25.317]  All right, Wade Alleroo, welcome back.
[02:35:25.357 --> 02:35:28.088]  There's my book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[02:35:28.128 --> 02:35:29.011]  I just got a, uh...
[02:35:29.634 --> 02:35:33.097]  I have about 20 emails waiting here for people who are watching the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:33.477 --> 02:35:34.658]  Wayne Root at gmail.com.
[02:35:34.678 --> 02:35:36.359]  But one of them caught my eye.
[02:35:36.379 --> 02:35:38.701]  I looked through about 10 of them.
[02:35:39.181 --> 02:35:45.025]  Frank says, I'm currently watching on the Alex Jones Show, enjoying your delivery and content as the guest host for the hour.
[02:35:45.065 --> 02:35:47.047]  And by the way, I do this hour every Tuesday.
[02:35:47.387 --> 02:35:48.828]  Thank you, Alex Jones and company.
[02:35:49.629 --> 02:35:51.570]  I promptly went to Amazon to buy your new book.
[02:35:51.970 --> 02:35:53.031]  Very excited to read it.
[02:35:53.071 --> 02:35:53.992]  Now, why am I mentioning this?
[02:35:54.412 --> 02:35:56.733]  Because he says, I'm from Winnipeg, Canada.
[02:35:57.254 --> 02:36:03.978]  So not even from America, but believe in what people like yourself stand for, and work for, and wanted to thank you.
[02:36:04.418 --> 02:36:06.199]  From the bottom of my heart, God bless Frank.
[02:36:06.239 --> 02:36:08.761]  So first of all, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[02:36:08.941 --> 02:36:19.720]   You know, all of us, Alex Jones, me, I don't care who it is, the late Rush Limbaugh, the Michael Savages, the Sean Hannity's, the Mark Levin's, none of us Are doing this for us.
[02:36:19.740 --> 02:36:26.422]  We're doing it for American or kids and our future grandkids and we're doing it for you and we're doing it for Canada.
[02:36:26.462 --> 02:36:43.187]  We're doing it for Australia and we're doing it for New Zealand and we're doing it for Great Britain and all the countries where the communist authoritarian fascist New World Order Great Reset leaders are in place trying to destroy your life.
[02:36:43.852 --> 02:36:52.863]  And so it warms the cockles of my heart when I see letters from Canadians that come in right while I'm on TV to say, bought your book and I can't wait to read it.
[02:36:53.003 --> 02:36:55.586]  And yes, there are great conservatives in Canada.
[02:36:56.067 --> 02:36:58.089]  Yes, there are great conservatives in Australia.
[02:36:58.530 --> 02:37:00.412]  Yes, there are great conservatives in Austria.
[02:37:01.138 --> 02:37:20.103]  Everywhere in the world where the communists and the globalists and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and George Soros are trying to take over, I believe the majority of the people are the silent majority, the middle class and the working class, and they try to destroy you, bankrupt you, take your rights away.
[02:37:20.563 --> 02:37:21.063]  Think about it.
[02:37:22.048 --> 02:37:22.849]  Think about Cuba.
[02:37:23.310 --> 02:37:24.291]  Think about Venezuela.
[02:37:24.352 --> 02:37:31.702]  Those are modern examples of communism and globalism and authoritarianism and dictatorships and tyranny.
[02:37:32.183 --> 02:37:37.852]   And in those countries, there was a rich, Upper class, rich people, and middle class.
[02:37:38.312 --> 02:37:39.653]  And then Castro came along.
[02:37:39.973 --> 02:37:42.234]  And then Hugo Chavez came along in Venezuela.
[02:37:42.775 --> 02:37:44.636]  And they instituted socialism.
[02:37:45.136 --> 02:37:46.537]  See, socialism is communism.
[02:37:46.577 --> 02:37:49.039]  Don't let people convince you they're two different things.
[02:37:49.679 --> 02:37:53.241]  Socialism is the economic system of capitalism.
[02:37:53.421 --> 02:37:54.322]  Excuse me, of capitalism.
[02:37:54.622 --> 02:37:55.283]  Of communism.
[02:37:55.843 --> 02:37:58.925]  Socialism is the economic system of communism.
[02:37:59.265 --> 02:38:00.366]  They go hand in hand.
[02:38:01.026 --> 02:38:09.831]  Communism is the political system that imprisons you, punishes you, and takes everything away from you, and tortures you, and murders you.
[02:38:10.431 --> 02:38:12.072]  Socialism doesn't do any of that.
[02:38:12.452 --> 02:38:16.494]  It's the economic system that bankrupts everything and everyone it touches.
[02:38:17.054 --> 02:38:23.176]  And so it makes all the rich people and all the business owners and all the middle class people that were living great lives.
[02:38:23.656 --> 02:38:27.697]  It makes them all live in poverty and misery and malaise.
[02:38:28.357 --> 02:38:34.499]  Soon you're driving a donkey cart or a 1958 Oldsmobile in 2022.
[02:38:34.999 --> 02:38:35.979]  You've got nothing.
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:40.341]  And you're in a Mad Max landscape, which is what Biden wants for all of us.
[02:38:40.821 --> 02:38:42.981]  And you've got nothing and no way to fight back.
[02:38:43.482 --> 02:38:44.882]  Oh, and they take your guns away.
[02:38:45.442 --> 02:38:50.825]  Every country in the history of the world that killed its citizens first took their guns away.
[02:38:51.345 --> 02:38:52.005]  I'm a Jew.
[02:38:52.586 --> 02:38:54.367]  Nazi Germany passed the law.
[02:38:54.767 --> 02:39:00.630]  No Jew could own a gun before they instituted the Holocaust and murdered my people.
[02:39:01.230 --> 02:39:03.012]  Guns are so important.
[02:39:03.432 --> 02:39:10.798]  As long as we all have arsenals in our homes, the government can never totally control us and take advantage of us.
[02:39:11.338 --> 02:39:18.284]  Always fight for the First Amendment, so you have freedom of speech, and the Second Amendment, so you have the guns to back it up.
[02:39:18.704 --> 02:39:20.065]  Without that, you have nothing.
[02:39:20.486 --> 02:39:22.007]  So what are Democrats trying to do?
[02:39:22.287 --> 02:39:23.228]  Yes, don't tread on me.
[02:39:23.508 --> 02:39:24.869]  What are Democrats trying to do?
[02:39:25.410 --> 02:39:29.053]  Take your guns away, so you're powerless and helpless, number one.
[02:39:29.073 --> 02:39:44.281]   And number two, Ban you and censor you and burn our conservative books and take away our free speech and social media and brainwash us with their communist propaganda and their lies about the vaccines and the vaccine mandates.
[02:39:44.682 --> 02:39:47.522]  Those of you who know me know I'm the world's biggest Donald Trump fan.
[02:39:47.562 --> 02:39:48.243]  I celebrate him.
[02:39:48.303 --> 02:39:48.903]  I root for him.
[02:39:49.583 --> 02:39:51.544]  And he was the greatest president in my lifetime.
[02:39:51.884 --> 02:39:56.445]  If he had a second term, he would have become the greatest president ever or certainly top five.
[02:39:56.886 --> 02:39:59.406]  But him and I disagree on one topic vehemently.
[02:39:59.787 --> 02:40:00.647]  Vaccines.
[02:40:01.127 --> 02:40:03.089]  The vaccines are killing people.
[02:40:03.389 --> 02:40:05.110]  The vaccines are crippling people.
[02:40:05.430 --> 02:40:07.252]  The vaccines are disabling people.
[02:40:07.532 --> 02:40:18.900]  The vaccines are the way to control us and kill us and weaken us and destroy our military and destroy our airline pilots and destroy our police and our first responders.
[02:40:19.621 --> 02:40:20.962]  Why Trump doesn't get that?
[02:40:21.362 --> 02:40:22.163]  I have no idea.
[02:40:23.365 --> 02:40:31.227]  But the reason I brought up this Canadian guy, Frank, who sent me that note, thank you, Frank, is a thank you for being a conservative in Canada.
[02:40:31.547 --> 02:40:33.067]  They probably wouldn't believe it, right?
[02:40:33.407 --> 02:40:34.627]  They don't think you still exist.
[02:40:34.767 --> 02:40:38.028]  And I know secretly most of Canada's conservatives.
[02:40:38.448 --> 02:40:48.270]  But number two, I firmly believe if we want to avoid a civil war, because we're not going to get there with just the vote, you and I know that.
[02:40:48.910 --> 02:41:07.639]  A vote can no longer take this country back, even though I want you all to vote Republican, and I want to win the House by a landslide, and I want to win the Senate by a large margin, and I want to win in 2024, even with rigged elections, if we have enough voters, we can even overcome the rig, like Trump did in 16.
[02:41:08.779 --> 02:41:17.644]  But that's not enough either, because the evil communist globalists all control every lever of government, every government agency.
[02:41:18.025 --> 02:41:19.686]  You saw what they did to Trump.
[02:41:20.086 --> 02:41:25.089]  They prevented him for four years from doing everything he really wanted and needed to do.
[02:41:26.570 --> 02:41:39.007]  They control the school system, they control the colleges, they control the courts, they control the media, they control Hollywood, and they control every government agency, and almost every government employee, and every teacher and professor.
[02:41:39.348 --> 02:41:40.750]  That's a lot to overcome!
[02:41:41.821 --> 02:41:49.768]  So I think, personally, and I'll bet you agree with me, we're beyond the point of winning through only elections and voting.
[02:41:50.189 --> 02:41:54.693]  Even though you've all got to vote and every vote counts, I'll never discourage you from voting.
[02:41:54.973 --> 02:41:56.975]  I will only encourage you to vote.
[02:41:57.335 --> 02:41:58.676]  But it's not enough.
[02:41:58.776 --> 02:41:59.357]  You know it.
[02:41:59.697 --> 02:42:00.378]  You feel it.
[02:42:00.438 --> 02:42:01.659]  The country's going under.
[02:42:01.959 --> 02:42:02.800]  They're destroying it.
[02:42:02.900 --> 02:42:03.901]  It's the Great Reset.
[02:42:04.221 --> 02:42:05.963]  And a vote will not be enough.
[02:42:06.403 --> 02:42:07.443]  So here are the choices.
[02:42:07.923 --> 02:42:13.245]  We're either going to go in the street and it's going to be a revolution or a civil war, or we're going to do it peacefully.
[02:42:13.585 --> 02:42:15.266]  And I'm rooting for no war.
[02:42:15.626 --> 02:42:17.086]  I'm rooting for no civil war.
[02:42:17.446 --> 02:42:20.127]  I'm rooting for nobody getting hurt, nobody getting killed.
[02:42:20.527 --> 02:42:26.969]  I'm rooting for the people of the patriots and the Christians shouldn't be in the street because we'll be fighting with the people we love.
[02:42:27.469 --> 02:42:29.630]  Military, National Guard, policemen.
[02:42:29.890 --> 02:42:30.730]  How are you going to do that?
[02:42:31.230 --> 02:42:31.830]  We love them.
[02:42:32.230 --> 02:42:33.191]  We can't shoot them.
[02:42:33.251 --> 02:42:34.191]  We can't fight with them.
[02:42:34.751 --> 02:42:36.993]  So we gotta come up with a peaceful solution.
[02:42:37.293 --> 02:42:38.073]  And I've got it.
[02:42:38.514 --> 02:42:45.078]  The Roe vs. Wade abortion ruling leads the way to my peaceful solution.
[02:42:45.518 --> 02:42:47.960]  And that is, we need a divorce.
[02:42:48.540 --> 02:42:49.721]  Think of the EU.
[02:42:50.361 --> 02:42:54.103]  Every single state in the EU is its own country.
[02:42:54.604 --> 02:42:59.607]  Germany, Spain, France, Italy, England, Netherlands, you name it, Belgium.
[02:43:00.686 --> 02:43:08.674]  They're all their own country with their own laws, their own tax systems, their own cultures, and over them is a banner.
[02:43:09.014 --> 02:43:12.538]  They're all united under the European Union, the EU.
[02:43:13.079 --> 02:43:21.327]  Why can't we have 50 states that are countries that are all united under the North American banner of the United States of America?
[02:43:21.807 --> 02:43:37.181]  So that red states go their separate way from blue states, although we may share an army, we may share a national defense, we may share a nuclear power system, but we each have our own economy, our own tax systems, and our own cultures, just like Europe.
[02:43:38.146 --> 02:43:44.450]  That's exactly what I believe needs to happen if we're going to avoid what liberals clearly want.
[02:43:44.930 --> 02:43:55.397]  Communists, liberals, progressives, socialists, Marxists, whatever you want to call them, they are spoiling for the end of America, the end of capitalism and a civil war.
[02:43:55.817 --> 02:44:01.080]  And they want to put government's boot on our necks and control our lives and destroy our lives.
[02:44:01.360 --> 02:44:17.730]   And it's clear to me We can't live with these people anymore, and their critical race theory, and all white people are evil, and transgenderism is great, and our kids should change their sex, and open all the borders, and vaccinate everyone, and mask everyone, and lock down everyone.
[02:44:18.110 --> 02:44:19.050]  They're insane.
[02:44:19.531 --> 02:44:23.213]  We need a divorce, a separation, a secession.
[02:44:23.633 --> 02:44:33.215]  And the blue states will go their separate ways from the red states and they'll live their way and we'll live our way with some common bond of the United States of America.
[02:44:33.695 --> 02:44:36.676]  That's what I think is the solution at this moment.
[02:44:37.036 --> 02:44:37.756]  I'm Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:44:38.016 --> 02:44:38.757]  We'll be right back.
[02:44:39.057 --> 02:44:40.597]  RootForAmerica.com.
[02:44:40.897 --> 02:44:51.340]  My email is WayneRoot at gmail.com and my book is The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book at Amazon or Barnes and Noble or RootForAmerica.com.
[02:44:51.580 --> 02:44:52.920]  See you in a sec.
[02:44:53.820 --> 02:44:55.141]  All right, Wayne Allyn Root, welcome back.
[02:44:55.201 --> 02:44:57.522]  WayneRoot at gmail.com is my email.
[02:44:57.582 --> 02:45:01.425]  I keep getting emails from all of you wonderful people and I love to hear from you.
[02:45:01.805 --> 02:45:02.586]  So that's number one.
[02:45:02.646 --> 02:45:05.207]  Number two is RootForAmerica.com, my website.
[02:45:05.548 --> 02:45:08.770]  And number three is my book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott book.
[02:45:09.230 --> 02:45:11.571]  And I never got a chance to finish because we were going out.
[02:45:12.732 --> 02:45:30.274]   Why I think that the Roe versus Wade decision, if it holds up, Will be the perfect entree for my idea, my vision, my argument that we need to have separate states that are like countries with their own culture, their own tax system, their own beliefs.
[02:45:31.175 --> 02:45:37.097]  And, you know, just like Europe under the blanket of the EU, we could be under the blanket of the United States or under North America.
[02:45:37.477 --> 02:45:41.159]  But the reality is we each have our own red states going our separate way.
[02:45:41.219 --> 02:45:41.879]  Why do I say that?
[02:45:42.479 --> 02:45:54.088]  Because liberals are the ones who are going to lose their minds if in fact the Supreme Court is ruling that Roe vs. Wade is no more and it's a state's rights issue.
[02:45:54.408 --> 02:45:56.450]  They're not ending abortion as we know it.
[02:45:56.490 --> 02:45:57.170]  That's a lie.
[02:45:57.551 --> 02:45:59.012]  They're not doing anything to end abortion.
[02:45:59.492 --> 02:46:01.574]  Each state gets to make their own decision.
[02:46:02.194 --> 02:46:08.796]  As per the Constitution and what the Founding Fathers had a vision of, it's correct.
[02:46:09.256 --> 02:46:11.656]  Each state should make their own decision.
[02:46:11.977 --> 02:46:20.439]  And if you're against abortion, and you believe it's murder, and you're a strong Christian, make sure your state bans abortion or severely limits abortion.
[02:46:20.879 --> 02:46:37.539]   But liberals like California, New York, Maryland, Illinois, Rhode Island, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, Very blue states, Massachusetts, will certainly have legal abortion and red states will not.
[02:46:37.899 --> 02:46:43.164]  It'll be no abortion or very limited severe restrictions on abortion as it should be.
[02:46:43.820 --> 02:46:46.701]  And so liberals will move out of those states.
[02:46:47.221 --> 02:46:53.844]  Liberal women, feminists and liberals in general can never live in a state where abortion is banned.
[02:46:54.164 --> 02:46:55.465]  They'll lose their mind.
[02:46:55.825 --> 02:47:01.087]  They'll all move to California, which makes our states much better places to live.
[02:47:01.507 --> 02:47:02.167]  Goodbye.
[02:47:02.247 --> 02:47:03.087]  God bless you.
[02:47:03.428 --> 02:47:05.588]  Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
[02:47:06.069 --> 02:47:06.649]  See you later.
[02:47:07.089 --> 02:47:07.969]  Arrivederci.
[02:47:08.349 --> 02:47:09.430]  You know, don't be back.
[02:47:10.100 --> 02:47:14.405]  So it's great this ruling doesn't ban abortion.
[02:47:14.765 --> 02:47:20.851]  It makes it a state's rights issue, which makes it more likely that states will pull away from each other.
[02:47:21.292 --> 02:47:26.056]  California will have nothing in common with Texas, right?
[02:47:26.377 --> 02:47:29.220]  New York will have nothing in common with Florida.
[02:47:29.700 --> 02:47:34.183]  And conservatives will flee New York for Florida and Texas and my state, Nevada.
[02:47:34.603 --> 02:47:39.505]  Californian conservatives will flee California for Nevada and Florida and Texas.
[02:47:40.046 --> 02:47:47.130]  And people in Florida and Texas who are liberal will flee for California and New York.
[02:47:47.350 --> 02:47:47.630]  Get it?
[02:47:48.050 --> 02:47:51.252]  That's the way I foresee America in the future.
[02:47:51.272 --> 02:47:57.055]  If we want to avoid civil war, avoid revolution, we have a peaceful answer.
[02:47:57.515 --> 02:47:59.017]  That answer is divorce.
[02:47:59.377 --> 02:48:00.599]  I don't call it secession.
[02:48:00.919 --> 02:48:03.122]  Secession reminds people of the Civil War.
[02:48:03.622 --> 02:48:04.223]  Divorce.
[02:48:04.483 --> 02:48:06.466]  Everyone's comfortable with divorce.
[02:48:06.566 --> 02:48:07.887]  Everybody's witnessed it.
[02:48:07.987 --> 02:48:09.169]  Everyone's experienced it.
[02:48:09.489 --> 02:48:16.137]  Either you've been divorced, one of your kids is currently divorced, or about to get divorced, or you grew up with a mom and a dad that were divorced.
[02:48:16.637 --> 02:48:19.419]  Everyone's been through a divorce of some kind or another.
[02:48:19.839 --> 02:48:21.741]  It's not the end of the world.
[02:48:22.221 --> 02:48:23.962]  In many ways, it makes your life better.
[02:48:24.503 --> 02:48:30.487]  I was divorced a few years ago, and I'm remarried to the most beautiful, wonderful woman in the world, Cindy Parker Root.
[02:48:30.867 --> 02:48:32.028]  And so I'm thrilled.
[02:48:32.368 --> 02:48:33.549]  It all worked out great.
[02:48:33.869 --> 02:48:35.210]  Thank God I got divorced.
[02:48:35.530 --> 02:48:38.912]  I'm sad I got divorced, but thank God it led to a better life.
[02:48:39.433 --> 02:48:43.756]  I think America needs a divorce, and it'll lead to a better life for all of us.
[02:48:44.216 --> 02:48:45.477]  Think about this, liberals.
[02:48:45.918 --> 02:48:47.659]  Wayne Root is making common sense.
[02:48:48.099 --> 02:48:48.940]  It's a win-win.
[02:48:49.901 --> 02:48:52.123]  You get open borders in California.
[02:48:52.563 --> 02:48:54.545]  You get illegals serving as policemen.
[02:48:54.905 --> 02:48:56.767]  You get illegals serving as judges.
[02:48:57.127 --> 02:49:01.731]  You get illegals serving as defenders in front of the court, public defenders.
[02:49:02.172 --> 02:49:04.013]  You get everything you ever wanted.
[02:49:04.033 --> 02:49:05.535]  Illegals get all the welfare they want.
[02:49:05.855 --> 02:49:07.376]  You have all the open borders you want.
[02:49:07.736 --> 02:49:08.657]  They all get free.
[02:49:08.897 --> 02:49:09.558]  They get to vote.
[02:49:09.578 --> 02:49:10.479]  They get free medical.
[02:49:11.459 --> 02:49:22.021]  And you get vaccine mandates for everyone, and mask mandates for everyone, and you can lock down the whole state with vaccines and masks for the rest of your freaking life!
[02:49:22.401 --> 02:49:24.542]  You could all hide in your home with masks on.
[02:49:25.002 --> 02:49:30.803]  You could all love Joe Biden and kneel down to the vaccine God you love, and the Biden God you love.
[02:49:30.823 --> 02:49:34.404]  You know, your God has dementia, but you don't notice that, so that's okay.
[02:49:35.185 --> 02:49:42.733]  And you can have all the green energy you want so that in the winter, in the summer, there's massive breakdowns and you freeze and burn to death.
[02:49:43.134 --> 02:49:43.975]  God bless you.
[02:49:43.995 --> 02:49:44.655]  That's great.
[02:49:45.176 --> 02:49:46.057]  You can have what you want.
[02:49:46.397 --> 02:49:47.399]  No more policemen.
[02:49:47.779 --> 02:49:52.584]  In your states, it'll all be social workers who show up when you call you're being murdered.
[02:49:52.845 --> 02:49:54.547]  They'll send the social worker with no weapon.
[02:49:55.027 --> 02:49:56.508]  California can have all that.
[02:49:56.869 --> 02:49:57.970]  New York can have all that.
[02:49:58.250 --> 02:50:00.151]  The streets will belong to the thugs.
[02:50:00.572 --> 02:50:03.614]  People will be murdered in the middle of the street in broad daylight.
[02:50:04.074 --> 02:50:04.835]  God bless it.
[02:50:04.955 --> 02:50:05.816]  Liberals love it.
[02:50:06.136 --> 02:50:06.917]  That's your state.
[02:50:07.417 --> 02:50:10.359]  Homeless and tense and poo and pee in the street.
[02:50:10.820 --> 02:50:12.241]  Everything you ever wanted.
[02:50:13.692 --> 02:50:15.072]  And we will have none of that.
[02:50:15.593 --> 02:50:17.813]  My state will have closed borders.
[02:50:18.234 --> 02:50:21.915]  My state will have no illegal aliens and no illegals voting.
[02:50:22.215 --> 02:50:24.496]  And my state won't give welfare to illegal aliens.
[02:50:24.836 --> 02:50:27.437]  My state won't give free health care to illegal aliens.
[02:50:27.777 --> 02:50:33.639]  You will not be able to go to college if you're an illegal alien in my state for free while good citizens pay for it.
[02:50:34.059 --> 02:50:35.299]  This is ridiculous.
[02:50:35.679 --> 02:50:40.721]  We won't have vaccine mandates or mask mandates or any lockdowns ever in my state.
[02:50:41.081 --> 02:50:41.301]  Right?
[02:50:41.561 --> 02:50:43.402]  We'll all have what we want.
[02:50:43.902 --> 02:50:45.623]  Why would you argue about that?
[02:50:46.003 --> 02:50:47.023]  Isn't that wonderful?
[02:50:47.383 --> 02:50:49.144]  Isn't that the definition of win-win?
[02:50:49.784 --> 02:50:51.765]  We need a secession.
[02:50:52.125 --> 02:50:54.006]  But I don't want to call it a secession.
[02:50:54.306 --> 02:50:55.266]  That's a bad word.
[02:50:55.686 --> 02:50:56.927]  We need a divorce.
[02:50:57.507 --> 02:51:02.469]  All of America is familiar and comfortable, if not sad, with divorce.
[02:51:02.829 --> 02:51:05.210]  We don't want it, but we've all experienced it.
[02:51:05.590 --> 02:51:07.490]  America needs a divorce.
[02:51:07.970 --> 02:51:09.131]  That's what we've got to have.
[02:51:09.791 --> 02:51:10.932]  I can't live with you.
[02:51:11.272 --> 02:51:12.373]  You're all crazy.
[02:51:12.713 --> 02:51:13.594]  Oh, you know what I left out?
[02:51:14.054 --> 02:51:17.397]  In the blue states, your children will all be brainwashed.
[02:51:17.837 --> 02:51:20.279]  All the boys will dress as girls.
[02:51:20.679 --> 02:51:23.301]  And all the girls will dress as boys.
[02:51:23.682 --> 02:51:26.043]  And the girls will wear their target binders.
[02:51:26.404 --> 02:51:29.966]  And the boys will wear their whatever the hell they call the thing that holds their thing in.
[02:51:30.407 --> 02:51:32.608]  And you'll all be crazy together.
[02:51:32.948 --> 02:51:34.610]  You whacked out nut jobs.
[02:51:35.170 --> 02:51:37.312]  All of you will believe white people are evil.
[02:51:37.732 --> 02:51:38.853]  And that's your right.
[02:51:39.233 --> 02:51:42.675]  In your state country called Cala, Mexico.
[02:51:43.035 --> 02:51:43.915]  God bless you!
[02:51:44.475 --> 02:51:47.397]  In New York, you'll all live happily ever after.
[02:51:47.737 --> 02:51:54.940]  The entire state will be a bunch of transgenders running around, women with penises and men with vaginas.
[02:51:55.280 --> 02:51:56.400]  God bless New York!
[02:51:56.781 --> 02:51:59.862]  I'm sorry I was ever born there and I never want to see it again.
[02:52:00.502 --> 02:52:01.603]  You can go to hell, New York.
[02:52:02.003 --> 02:52:05.666]  So we will live in red states where everything will be normal.
[02:52:06.106 --> 02:52:15.552]  All of you will get your bizarre, abnormal behavior out and you can have all the parades you want for transgenders and boys who become girls and girls who become boys.
[02:52:15.892 --> 02:52:23.337]  And they'll all be watched over, not by policemen at the parade, but by social workers with a pen, not a gun.
[02:52:23.778 --> 02:52:25.319]  Isn't that the liberal dream?
[02:52:25.799 --> 02:52:28.421]  And you'll all be riding around in electric cars.
[02:52:28.841 --> 02:52:29.962]  Oh, it's so wonderful.
[02:52:30.482 --> 02:52:31.763]  So that's it.
[02:52:32.183 --> 02:52:33.283]  That's the answer.
[02:52:33.823 --> 02:52:34.784]  It's a divorce.
[02:52:35.244 --> 02:52:41.966]  We all need a divorce in the United States of America because I've come to realize I can't live with you people.
[02:52:42.346 --> 02:52:43.847]  I can't live under you people.
[02:52:44.147 --> 02:52:46.148]  I will never take orders from you people.
[02:52:46.528 --> 02:52:47.888]  You're all crazy.
[02:52:48.188 --> 02:52:57.872]  You're brain damaged like Joe Biden and you have no right to rule my life and tell me what to do because everything you believe in is bizarre.
[02:52:58.312 --> 02:53:25.743]  And by the way, I left out, in the blue states they will censor, they'll book ban, they will ban anyone from speaking who doesn't agree with them, they'll put you in some sort of Twitter hell, they'll put you in some sort of re-education camp, they'll torture you and brainwash you, they'll take your property away, and in red states we'll all live under wonderful capitalism and we'll all make money and enjoy prosperity for the rest of all time.
[02:53:26.103 --> 02:53:31.307]   God bless Texas, Florida, And Wyoming, and Idaho, and maybe Montana.
[02:53:31.607 --> 02:53:42.216]  And I hope my state of Nevada, every day the whole California moves here, and every one of them that I meet is a Republican moving here, escaping from the madness of California.
[02:53:42.556 --> 02:53:45.798]  I hope you're making my state a red state, but we shall see.
[02:53:46.179 --> 02:53:49.141]  I believe the elections are rigged, so it really doesn't matter.
[02:53:49.581 --> 02:53:53.705]  Once Democrats get in control, they rig it so Republicans can never win.
[02:53:54.349 --> 02:54:00.357]  I promised you I'd finish up the commentary I started about the greatest GOP salesman of all time, Joe Biden.
[02:54:00.777 --> 02:54:02.980]  I talked about all the terrible things Biden has done.
[02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:04.201]  Here's the result.
[02:54:04.702 --> 02:54:10.449]  Latinos have moved from lifelong Democrats to a double-digit GOP lead.
[02:54:10.849 --> 02:54:15.969]   Can you imagine Biden has changed the political beliefs of an entire race of
[02:54:15.969 --> 02:54:21.108]   people in the United States in only 18 months and parents with children under
[02:54:21.108 --> 02:54:27.088]   the age of 18 are now supporting the GOP by a 21 point landslide.
[02:54:27.088 --> 02:54:30.728]  Biden has turned liberal mothers into GOP mama bears.
[02:54:30.728 --> 02:54:33.929]  Even young people are becoming Republicans.
[02:54:34.252 --> 02:54:39.075]  Biden's ratings are lower among young people than any other age group in the United States.
[02:54:39.175 --> 02:54:45.798]  So Trump is superhuman, but Biden wins my award as the greatest GOP salesman in history.
[02:54:46.318 --> 02:54:46.958]  Thanks, Joe.
[02:54:47.298 --> 02:54:47.959]  You're the best.
[02:54:48.499 --> 02:54:50.360]  Nobody has ever done it better.
[02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:54.622]  Wayne Allyn Root, guest host for Alex Jones every Tuesday in this hour.
[02:54:55.102 --> 02:54:56.663]  WayneRoot at gmail.com.
[02:54:57.043 --> 02:54:58.063]  RootForAmerica.com.
[02:55:00.516 --> 02:55:04.718]  And the great Patriot protest and boycott book is my baby.
[02:55:04.997 --> 02:55:07.997]  Coming up next, more of Alex Jones.
[02:55:07.997 --> 02:55:14.397]  [MUSIC]
[02:55:14.397 --> 02:55:18.397]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have had quite a run here at InfoWars.
[02:55:18.785 --> 02:55:23.868]  We've had a huge, huge effect when it comes to the fight against the globalists.
[02:55:24.908 --> 02:55:26.189]  And we've changed the world together.
[02:55:27.202 --> 02:55:37.410]  And I want to thank you for all you've done over the years with your prayers, your word of mouth, and shopping with us, and supporting us, while at the same time getting great products, and then fullwarestore.com.
[02:55:38.691 --> 02:55:57.175]   But now because of supply chain breakdowns, and now because of all the Democratic Party funded lawsuits, and the slanted nature of those attacks, We are maxed out and pushed up against a wall, just like America is pushed up against a wall.
[02:55:57.476 --> 02:56:02.286]  And we're being bullied, we're being brutalized by the special interests that want to get through us.
[02:56:03.336 --> 02:56:04.396]  To be able to get to you.
[02:56:04.476 --> 02:56:13.258]  So if we put today's live show headline up on screen for TV viewers and ask the question, did Alex Jones Infowars declare bankruptcy?
[02:56:14.199 --> 02:56:15.239]  Tune in and learn the truth.
[02:56:15.359 --> 02:56:41.908]   If you scroll down in that live show feed today, you'll find a subsection that's on InfowarsStore.com where when you click on it, it takes you to a sub page And InfoWarsTore.com, where you can make a $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 one-time donation, or you can sign up for a recurring donation cancel any time.
[02:56:42.609 --> 02:56:50.955]  But this is the time in the fight for freedom to understand they're going to take everything from you if you don't start spending time and energy in the fight.
[02:56:51.255 --> 02:56:54.938]  And I'm not talking to regular listeners that have supported us over the years and done a great job.
[02:56:55.198 --> 02:57:00.169]   I'm talking to new listeners or occasional listeners You need to understand.
[02:57:01.158 --> 02:57:10.746]  This is a serious situation we're in and you need to put skin in the game financially to keep operations on the air like Infowars.
[02:57:11.206 --> 02:57:18.752]  Think of the millions of people that learned about ivermectin and zinc and vitamin D and hydroxychloroquine alone from this show.
[02:57:19.112 --> 02:57:23.556]  Think about the pedophile drag queen story times that have been exposed and stopped by this broadcast.
[02:57:24.277 --> 02:57:29.221]  Think about our border reports exposing the human smuggling that triggered congressional investigations.
[02:57:29.981 --> 02:57:32.503]  Think about our anti-war reporting.
[02:57:32.623 --> 02:57:37.786]  Think about our 9-11 and Bohemian Grove and our reporting on the globalist, the occult.
[02:57:38.086 --> 02:57:45.711]  I mean, to try to list our exposure of fluoride in the water and atrazine and the attack on our children with the whole transgender cult.
[02:57:46.351 --> 02:57:51.435]  Think about everything we've been through together and just imagine InfoWars not being there.
[02:57:52.415 --> 02:58:02.788]   So I want to ask you to go to InfoWarsStore.com And every day during the live show, under the live show feed, we'll have a link to it as well, where you can donate, and we can buy products.

[02:58:20.998 --> 02:58:23.619]  Because we can't sit there and pay for the larger inventory.
[02:58:23.659 --> 02:58:24.440]  We just can't do it.

[02:58:46.309 --> 02:58:47.570]  It's an expensive shirt for us to make.
