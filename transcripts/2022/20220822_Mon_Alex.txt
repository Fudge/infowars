[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:03.651]  Look what Elon tweeted out yesterday, got hundreds of thousands of retweets.
[00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:04.831]  Elon Musk.
[00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:07.473]  Here's the actual image.
[00:00:09.373 --> 00:00:12.755]  Please let me use the CERN Large Hadron Collider.
[00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:19.998]  I'm normal and can be trusted with a demonic technology unlike anything the world has ever seen.
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.841]  What is a demonic technology?
[00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:30.363]   Well, they admit they're trying to find the God particle.
[00:00:32.804 --> 00:00:44.032]  They admit they're trying to create artificial black holes and strangelets that create particles so strong it sinks the center of the Earth and then creates a black hole that implodes the entire planet.
[00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:45.473]  It's not a Star Trek movie.
[00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:46.534]  It's reality.
[00:00:47.455 --> 00:00:48.195]  And they're there.
[00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.898]  It blew up a few years ago the last time they tried it.
[00:00:51.978 --> 00:00:54.620]  Now they're doing these tests again.
[00:00:56.141 --> 00:01:02.545]  And while they're doing the test, they're constantly doing satanic rituals above ground, on the facilities.
[00:01:04.186 --> 00:01:04.546]  Acreage.
[00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:09.896]   So here's another Gregory's report from a few months ago where he come back and hit all the Russian news, the
[00:01:09.896 --> 00:01:15.805]   economy news, and so much more, but Elon Musk is now putting out tweets about demonic
[00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:19.326]   technology that can destroy the earth and the evidence is that's true.
[00:01:19.326 --> 00:01:29.385]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:50.327]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:50.447 --> 00:01:51.268]  InfoWars.
[00:01:51.568 --> 00:01:53.090]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:01:55.379 --> 00:02:02.019]   The spokesperson for evil has come out and said that their attempted world
[00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:05.780]  continual never-ending lockdown and forced injection failed.
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:14.340]  They put out a press release yesterday.
[00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:17.049]  They put out a podcast with Klaus Schwab and others.
[00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:21.591]  And they have declared their number one enemy InfoWars.
[00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:31.174]  And have said that they've hired 110,000 operatives that they called information warriors.
[00:02:33.435 --> 00:02:34.776]  Where have we heard that term before?
[00:02:34.836 --> 00:02:35.697]  The info warriors.
[00:02:36.077 --> 00:02:36.698]  The counter.
[00:02:37.678 --> 00:02:38.339]  We the people.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.804]  I mean, man, I keep trying to explain to the listeners, they're really scared of us.
[00:02:47.244 --> 00:02:52.308]  Not just me, but the fact that we've got the Death Star plans.
[00:02:56.377 --> 00:03:02.358]  And if people pay attention, folks will know the future and how to counter what's about to go down.
[00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:04.459]  And then it's game over.
[00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:12.040]  And they are so panicked that we know their exact plans from deep research and total focus.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.801]  And then if Congress and legislatures and other leaders like Bolsonaro run with the ball, it's game over.
[00:03:20.181 --> 00:03:23.082]  Klaus Schwab's going to prison like his grandfather.
[00:03:25.262 --> 00:03:26.782]  It's Nuremberg 2.0!
[00:03:29.623 --> 00:03:33.665]  But if we don't expose them, they're going to collapse civilization around us and pose us as savers.
[00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:43.948]  How honored are you, as the army of InfoWars, to know that you're in direct conflict and information warfare with Klaus Schwab and the New World Order?
[00:03:44.308 --> 00:03:46.608]  Now do you understand why I say share the articles and videos?
[00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:55.080]   Now do you understand why I say Magnify what we're doing because I don't want to be the best in the fight because I'm not that good.
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.361]  I want to stop these people.
[00:03:56.401 --> 00:04:02.087]  I want to see other leaders like Tucker Carlson, Bolsonaro, Joe Rogan, countless others stand up and they're starting to.
[00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:02.947]  But you know what?
[00:04:02.787 --> 00:04:09.787]   what the enemy recognizes us and me as the number one enemy of their new world order.
[00:04:09.787 --> 00:04:14.787]  [Music]
[00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:19.787]  [Music]
[00:04:19.787 --> 00:04:20.787]  [Music]
[00:04:20.787 --> 00:04:25.787]   Alex Jones here issuing an emergency warning to President Trump.
[00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:37.830]  Not a warning out of any desire to hurt you, President Trump, but to save your important legacy and hopefully ensure you can get back into the White House coming up in 2024.
[00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.091]  We know the election was stolen.
[00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:43.753]  We know the deep state's trying to set you up any way they can.
[00:04:44.213 --> 00:05:05.320]   We understand that you are a lion surrounded by hyenas, but the number one issue That is going to end up biting you in the ass like nothing else is the experimental shot that Fauci and Bill Gates and Birx and the rest of them convinced you would actually save millions of lives and get the economy going when they had brought out their lockdowns.
[00:05:05.748 --> 00:05:06.608]  I know why you did it.
[00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:08.989]  You've done so many other great things for this nation.
[00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:10.970]  And I admire you and I appreciate you.
[00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.751]  And I want to support you for president.
[00:05:13.491 --> 00:05:21.114]  But Ron DeSantis is coming out and admitting that the vaccines don't work because now the CDC and others have been forced to admit that.
[00:05:21.394 --> 00:05:28.997]  Even as now even the CDC is backhandedly acknowledging that the shots aren't preventing people from getting infected.
[00:05:29.417 --> 00:05:41.717]   We have Deborah Birx coming out and saying she knew the COVID vaccine wouldn't protect We have Walensky, the current head of the CDC, coming out and saying that they were wrong about all this.
[00:05:41.897 --> 00:05:44.578]  We made some pretty public mistakes and we need to own them.
[00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:50.702]  This admission came after the CDC received the findings of an external review she ordered of the agency.
[00:05:51.242 --> 00:05:56.586]  The CDC says the review found the agency's COVID guidance was confusing and overwhelming.
[00:05:56.866 --> 00:06:00.168]  But you are still out there saying, no, it's great, and you're proud of it.
[00:06:00.928 --> 00:06:25.046]  Now that they've admittedly set you and America and the world up with an experimental drug they rolled out of gene therapy against the general public, it is critical for you to decouple from these people like Bolsonaro and other leaders like Viktor Orban have done, saying, hey, at first we were for this, we thought it might help, but now we know it doesn't work, it's a fraud, and we need to put the brakes on this.
[00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:26.988]  President Trump, I care about you.
[00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:28.350]  I know you mean well.
[00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.331]  You're a very smart man.
[00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:34.031]   but they're coming after six-month-old and up babies with these dangerous shots.
[00:06:34.031 --> 00:06:40.031]  [Music]
[00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:47.161]   We are being told that we must stop eating beef because the methane produced by cattle burps and farts is
[00:06:47.161 --> 00:06:49.031]  accelerating global warming.
[00:06:49.938 --> 00:06:51.419]  So let's look at the science.
[00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:59.883]  Mass balance calculations take into account material being added, exchanged, and lost during natural processes.
[00:07:00.303 --> 00:07:07.126]  And Australian geologist Ian Plymer breaks down this science in Eat Beef, Save the Planet.
[00:07:07.726 --> 00:07:13.870]  Grass, along with most plant life, consumes carbon dioxide from the air as food.
[00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.192]  The more CO2, the greener the environment.
[00:07:17.592 --> 00:07:22.555]  So the theory that CO2 levels are hurting the environment is flawed from the start.
[00:07:23.015 --> 00:07:30.780]  But for the sake of argument, we can examine the science and see if cow farts actually are increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere.
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:40.122]  The grass consumes CO2 from the air, and when it dies, methane is released, which quickly separates into CO2 and water vapor.
[00:07:40.742 --> 00:07:45.823]  When the grass is eaten by cattle, this carbon is recycled in various ways.
[00:07:46.303 --> 00:07:55.765]  Cattle waste fertilizes the grass with some of this carbon, and the rest is stored in meat, milk, blood, intestines, bones, and skin.
[00:07:56.625 --> 00:08:07.831]  Thanks to the cattle, carbon is taken from the grass and used as fertilizer, stored in leather goods, and consumed as food, where most of it stays with the body until death.
[00:08:08.411 --> 00:08:16.476]  And so the processes of meat production and consumption actually removes carbon from the atmosphere and recycles it elsewhere.
[00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:24.160]  Humans, cattle, and grass are all parts of the same natural ecosystem, and carbon is the building block.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.704]  The entire anti-meat agenda is built upon lies.
[00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:38.615]  Grass-fed beef is so nutritious that an all-beef diet has become a very popular choice for people cleansing and healing from several ailments and disease.
[00:08:39.396 --> 00:08:44.942]  Humans are omnivores, and that means we have the ability to survive on both plants and animals.
[00:08:45.542 --> 00:09:00.095]  Our teeth are able to cut and masticate animal flesh, and we have the digestive enzyme trypsin for breaking down meat, which has allowed the human brain to grow larger over time, allows us to grow stronger, and operate more efficiently.
[00:09:00.635 --> 00:09:05.059]  Many people eat vegetarian diets because they believe that eating meat is immoral.
[00:09:05.459 --> 00:09:13.226]  This argument is taught like a religion, with the main rule being, don't eat anything with a face, which doesn't make any sense.
[00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:18.050]  What about the millions of microorganisms we consume in a single glass of water?
[00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.132]  Do they not deserve the same respect?
[00:09:20.832 --> 00:09:27.038]  Experiments with plants and vegetables show how they feel pain and recognize the person who hurt them.
[00:09:27.698 --> 00:09:31.240]  Do they not deserve the same respect simply because they have no face?
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:37.282]  A simple law of the physical natural world is that life is sustained by life.
[00:09:38.043 --> 00:09:42.825]  Every living thing sustains its own life by consuming other living things.
[00:09:43.605 --> 00:09:47.147]  This is true of the carnivore, the omnivore, and the vegan.
[00:09:47.807 --> 00:09:51.269]  The moral argument of veganism is just another ego trip.
[00:09:52.168 --> 00:09:56.889]  Many are learning veganism from modern yoga teachers, as if it were an ancient religion.
[00:09:57.689 --> 00:09:58.490]  But this is a myth.
[00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:03.071]  The cow was sacred in traditional yoga because it sustained life.
[00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:11.113]  Vegetarianism was only promoted among the lower castes so that enough meat was available to the warrior and priest classes.
[00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:13.754]  And that's all that's happening today.
[00:10:14.134 --> 00:10:21.759]  The all-powerful 0.1% want us lower castes to eat bugs while they save the best for themselves.
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.501]  But it's even worse than that.
[00:10:23.841 --> 00:10:25.882]  They want us all to get sick and die.
[00:10:26.403 --> 00:10:35.469]  In an evaluation of edible insects and the transmission of parasitic diseases, one-third of all insects studied were found to be pathogenic to humans.
[00:10:36.329 --> 00:10:44.337]  And most insects contain chitin, which is a modified polysaccharide present in most insects and absent in all mammals.
[00:10:45.017 --> 00:10:55.807]  We cannot digest it, and it is known to cause several health issues with humans who consume it, including respiratory issues and the accelerated growth of cancer cells.
[00:10:56.828 --> 00:10:59.389]  The real problem isn't beef consumption.
[00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.110]  It's factory farming.
[00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:05.952]  And we can solve this by incentivizing local grass-fed cattle farming.
[00:11:06.993 --> 00:11:09.174]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:11:12.195 --> 00:11:16.437]  That is what you call a fabulously informative and true report.
[00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.878]  Sacred cows, the dangers of eating bugs.
[00:11:18.898 --> 00:11:19.879]  It went live Saturday.
[00:11:20.871 --> 00:11:26.196]  I'm going to have it added to the live show feed today and bring it back to the front page of InfoWars.com.
[00:11:26.216 --> 00:11:28.177]  That is all completely, absolutely true.
[00:11:28.217 --> 00:11:30.880]  What an incredible, short report.
[00:11:31.821 --> 00:11:32.881]  Less than five minutes long.
[00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:34.623]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:11:34.703 --> 00:11:36.164]  Get it and share it.
[00:11:36.324 --> 00:11:37.746]  Take it, re-upload it wherever you want.
[00:11:37.806 --> 00:11:39.387]  None of our stuff is trademark copyright.
[00:11:39.767 --> 00:11:40.648]  It's free to air.
[00:11:40.828 --> 00:11:41.649]  Get it out there.
[00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:43.671]  All right.
[00:11:47.366 --> 00:11:49.527]  We've got an incredible broadcast lined up today.
[00:11:51.007 --> 00:11:54.929]  Every broadcast is really informative and amazing, but this one is just over the top.
[00:11:55.789 --> 00:12:09.014]  Steve Kirsch, who is an investigative journalist and also a major tech entrepreneur and engineer, has put all the studies and research from the insurance companies and governments together, proving mass death from the poison shots.
[00:12:09.474 --> 00:12:21.075]   He joins us in the second hour, and then, of course, Stockbroker expert, trends forecaster Edward Dowd with the biggest developments yet, joining us in the third hour today.
[00:12:23.236 --> 00:12:27.939]  And then Gerald Cilente will be taking over in the fourth hour.
[00:12:28.699 --> 00:12:30.900]  Big broadcast ahead of Owen Schroeder, 3 p.m.
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.462]  Central, always informative on The War Room.
[00:12:34.602 --> 00:12:34.842]  All right.
[00:12:37.764 --> 00:12:44.970]   When we come back, still a long time till break, but when we come back, Elon Musk has put out his most important tweet yet.
[00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:53.153]  We have the execution, assassination of Alexander Dugan's daughter.
[00:12:53.473 --> 00:12:54.394]  They were trying to kill him.
[00:12:54.434 --> 00:12:57.995]  What that really signifies, massive economy news.
[00:12:58.575 --> 00:13:00.116]  So much on the Great Reset.
[00:13:01.677 --> 00:13:02.397]  And more today.
[00:13:02.457 --> 00:13:04.678]  This is another broadcast you're not going to want to miss.
[00:13:04.698 --> 00:13:06.398]  But separately, here is the good news.
[00:13:06.499 --> 00:13:07.459]  Freedom is popular.
[00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:13.854]  This book, with no advertising in the corporate media, has gone to number five.
[00:13:14.314 --> 00:13:21.099]  It fluctuates between that and the top hundred on Amazon.com, the number one book platform in the world.
[00:13:21.119 --> 00:13:25.902]  It's the equivalent of the New York Times bestseller list before they got caught rigging it in the last 20 years.
[00:13:25.922 --> 00:13:27.503]  So nobody looks at it or believes it anymore.
[00:13:27.523 --> 00:13:28.204]  It's totally fake.
[00:13:28.244 --> 00:13:29.985]  The Amazon chart is 100% real.
[00:13:30.445 --> 00:13:33.768]  This has been in the top 10 off and on for several weeks.
[00:13:33.888 --> 00:13:35.269]  And you see, this is the actual book.
[00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:37.532]  It is here.
[00:13:37.552 --> 00:13:39.838]  It is ready to ship, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:40.018 --> 00:13:45.551]  And I can tell you that there are a few thousand books left at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:13:46.749 --> 00:13:47.829]  Until a new order comes in.
[00:13:47.889 --> 00:13:51.730]  But for the time being, this will be the only signed books I do.
[00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.230]  And it's a fundraiser to keep us on air.
[00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:54.631]  It's absolutely critical.
[00:13:54.651 --> 00:13:58.671]  I want to thank all of you that went and got the signed fundraiser copy of the book.
[00:13:59.331 --> 00:14:00.152]  It's a piece of history.
[00:14:00.192 --> 00:14:01.172]  It's the Death Star Plan.
[00:14:01.532 --> 00:14:02.872]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:14:02.912 --> 00:14:06.253]  It's your last chance to get a signed copy at infowarestore.com.
[00:14:06.673 --> 00:14:09.754]  And it is a fundraiser we're doing, so thank you so much for your support.
[00:14:09.774 --> 00:14:11.014]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:14:12.054 --> 00:14:21.100]  It is my magnum opus, it is a masterwork, and it just absolutely, devastatingly lays out how evil and sick these people are.
[00:14:22.741 --> 00:14:32.526]  It is a must-read, now available exclusively signed copies at Infowarshore.com or unsigned copies at Amazon.com and hundreds of other platforms, and we do want to push it to number one.
[00:14:33.107 --> 00:14:37.169]  We are barred from shipping it until the 29th.
[00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.191]  And so we've got a warehouse full of them.
[00:14:41.231 --> 00:14:44.093]  We have eight pallets of the book.
[00:14:44.814 --> 00:14:47.075]  We've got a few thousand copies left that haven't sold.
[00:14:47.215 --> 00:14:48.636]  All the rest are waiting for you.
[00:14:49.137 --> 00:14:54.720]  And I'm about to go into machine gun fashion, hours a day, doing this right here.
[00:14:55.661 --> 00:15:03.726]  Signing The Great Reset and The War for the World, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:05.527 --> 00:15:07.008]  That is the first signed book right there.
[00:15:07.028 --> 00:15:07.809]  Boom.
[00:15:09.212 --> 00:15:11.014]  They're gonna have it as a semi-line, just handing them to me.
[00:15:11.514 --> 00:15:16.298]  And I love it because you're supporting us, you're getting a piece of history, you're getting the Death Star plans.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.503]  It is going to be amazing.
[00:15:22.884 --> 00:15:26.747]  Their attempts to shut us down are backfiring big time.
[00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:31.472]  And I'm very blessed, very honored to be here with you now.
[00:15:31.572 --> 00:15:35.255]  So get your signed copies exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:15:37.142 --> 00:15:42.554]  And they predict this book is going to go to number one in the world.
[00:15:43.296 --> 00:15:47.064]  What an important message to the New World Order, their attempts to silence us.
[00:15:47.124 --> 00:15:47.424]  Okay.
[00:15:49.076 --> 00:15:50.576]  You want the inside baseball?
[00:15:50.596 --> 00:15:51.977]  We're as close to it as you're gonna get.
[00:15:52.677 --> 00:15:54.557]  Tell the enemy tunes in to figure out what's going on.
[00:15:55.018 --> 00:15:56.158]  Most of them are compartmentalized.
[00:15:56.458 --> 00:15:57.358]  We're very blessed to be here.
[00:15:57.438 --> 00:15:58.338]  All glory goes to God.
[00:15:58.358 --> 00:16:02.299]  We'll be back on the other side and launch the main transmission today.
[00:16:02.319 --> 00:16:05.620]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now to mfowards.com forward slash show.
[00:16:06.961 --> 00:16:07.921]  Oh yeah!
[00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:10.041]  Ride the tiger!
[00:16:10.662 --> 00:16:13.202]  You can see its stripes, but you know it's clean.
[00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:16.023]  Holy divah!
[00:16:17.864 --> 00:16:19.285]  You're the one that's clean.
[00:16:19.305 --> 00:16:21.786]  Ride the tiger.
[00:16:23.287 --> 00:16:24.247]  Gotta get away.
[00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:31.131]  Between the velvet lies, there's a truth as hard as steel.
[00:16:32.671 --> 00:16:35.353]  Something is coming for you.
[00:16:36.813 --> 00:16:37.914]  Gotta run away.
[00:16:40.015 --> 00:16:40.715]  Here's the key.
[00:16:41.196 --> 00:16:45.698]  Between the velvet lies, there's a truth.
[00:16:49.093 --> 00:16:50.034]  The vision!
[00:16:50.055 --> 00:17:01.291]  Alright, let's get to the big news here.
[00:17:02.614 --> 00:17:09.516]  I know for a fact, and I told you this a couple years ago, that Elon Musk was riding the fence, and that he decided to fight the New World Order.
[00:17:09.536 --> 00:17:17.519]  At least he told his top advisors that, and said he was going for a pro-human future, and to not depopulate the Earth, and to fight the New World Order.
[00:17:17.539 --> 00:17:22.860]  Now whether he's being legitimate or not, Christ says you judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:17:24.181 --> 00:17:27.722]  Look what Elon tweeted out yesterday, got hundreds of thousands of retweets.
[00:17:28.182 --> 00:17:28.882]  Elon Musk.
[00:17:30.663 --> 00:17:31.503]  Here's the actual image.
[00:17:33.459 --> 00:17:36.823]  Please let me use the CERN Large Hadron Collider.
[00:17:38.605 --> 00:17:44.091]  I'm normal and can be trusted with a demonic technology unlike anything the world has ever seen.
[00:17:46.934 --> 00:17:48.936]  What is a demonic technology?
[00:17:49.216 --> 00:17:54.422]  Well, they admit they're trying to find the God Particle.
[00:17:56.872 --> 00:18:08.095]  They admit they're trying to create artificial black holes and strangelets that create particles so strong it sinks the center of the Earth and then creates a black hole that implodes the entire planet.
[00:18:08.315 --> 00:18:09.535]  It's not a Star Trek movie.
[00:18:09.695 --> 00:18:10.616]  It's reality.
[00:18:11.516 --> 00:18:12.276]  And they're there.
[00:18:13.577 --> 00:18:15.957]  It blew up a few years ago the last time they tried it.
[00:18:16.037 --> 00:18:18.678]  Now they're doing these tests again.
[00:18:20.219 --> 00:18:26.620]  And while they're doing the test, they're constantly doing satanic rituals above ground, on the facilities.
[00:18:28.261 --> 00:18:28.621]  Acreage.
[00:18:29.821 --> 00:18:43.524]  So here's another Greg Reif's report from a few months ago, and we're gonna come back and hit all the Russian news, the economy news, and so much more, but Elon Musk is now putting out tweets about demonic technology that can destroy the Earth, and the evidence is that's true.
[00:18:45.725 --> 00:18:48.944]   These people aren't Playing games.
[00:18:49.865 --> 00:18:53.810]  Elon Musk, please let me use the CERN Large Hadron Collider.
[00:18:54.572 --> 00:18:58.697]  I'm normal and can be trusted with a demonic technology unlike anything the world has ever seen.
[00:18:59.699 --> 00:19:02.062]  Here is the report posted at band.video.
[00:19:01.922 --> 00:19:21.280]  I suggest you watch it and share it.
[00:19:21.272 --> 00:19:39.820]  And even though they invented the internet in 1989, they are most famous for their 666 logo, a video of a woman being ritually sacrificed on CERN grounds, at the altar of Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction, and for potentially destroying the universe.
[00:19:41.707 --> 00:19:49.171]  Multiple lawsuits have been filed to stop CERN's particle collider, in fear that it could destroy the Earth.
[00:19:51.072 --> 00:19:59.037]  Which revealed to the public that CERN is a sovereign entity, outside the jurisdiction of the courts, so they can do whatever they want.
[00:20:00.257 --> 00:20:01.318]  What is it that they're doing?
[00:20:01.918 --> 00:20:11.944]  It has to do with high-velocity counter-rotational spin, which was first documented in Nazi Germany's most secret program, die Glocke, the bell.
[00:20:12.705 --> 00:20:17.448]  According to surviving documents, the bell was somehow affecting time and space.
[00:20:17.908 --> 00:20:25.493]  The most distinctive aspect of the bell was high-velocity counter-rotational spin, also known as torsion physics.
[00:20:26.585 --> 00:20:35.254]  Many are concerned that CERN is attempting to open a portal into another dimension that will allow demonic entities to enter ours.
[00:20:36.355 --> 00:20:44.664]  This was blatantly portrayed six years ago in a pagan ritual to celebrate the opening of the Gothard Tunnel just east of CERN.
[00:20:45.384 --> 00:20:49.709]  The dimension they would be attempting to open is already somewhat accessible.
[00:20:51.104 --> 00:20:52.706]  Do you hear voices in your head?
[00:20:53.326 --> 00:20:57.311]  If you do, then you likely know it's best to keep that to yourself.
[00:20:58.011 --> 00:21:00.794]  Because a doctor will tell you that you're a schizophrenic.
[00:21:01.275 --> 00:21:05.419]  Modern psychiatry calls these voices auditory hallucinations.
[00:21:05.939 --> 00:21:12.947]  And even though a whopping 1% of the world's population suffers from schizophrenia, there isn't much research.
[00:21:13.707 --> 00:21:24.720]  But after 30 years of working closely with the criminally insane, Jerry Marzinski has noticed that the voices talking to these schizophrenics are all saying the same things.
[00:21:25.321 --> 00:21:27.603]  There is a distinct predictable pattern.
[00:21:28.644 --> 00:21:36.068]  The voices are exclusively generating negative emotion, leaving the patient physically and emotionally drained.
[00:21:36.768 --> 00:21:41.830]  The voices are always pulling a person away from God or anything positive.
[00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:49.554]  The voices are always a call to action, instructing the person to either hurt themselves or hurt someone else.
[00:21:50.494 --> 00:21:56.819]  Which is probably why the voices always rebel against the drugs that are prescribed for schizophrenia.
[00:21:57.219 --> 00:22:01.922]  These drugs make a person comatose and the voices want you to do things.
[00:22:02.963 --> 00:22:12.870]  Marzynski believes that schizophrenics are being attacked by non-physical entities that he calls energy parasites because they feed off of negative energy.
[00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:25.075]  And in practically every case, the victim has experienced severe trauma, usually sexual trauma, which explains why the voices tell people to traumatize others.
[00:22:25.755 --> 00:22:27.836]  These demons want more victims.
[00:22:29.548 --> 00:22:40.657]  According to the ancient Gnostics, who referred to these entities as Archons, they are destructive, sadistic beings, who control the Earth via the thoughts of humans.
[00:22:41.758 --> 00:22:43.019]  Voices in the head.
[00:22:43.659 --> 00:22:50.745]  This explains the rampant pedophilia we are seeing today, and the incestuous inbreeding of royal bloodlines.
[00:22:51.285 --> 00:22:55.789]  These energy parasites need traumatized people to feed upon.
[00:22:57.515 --> 00:23:01.883]  Perhaps some of the thoughts in our own mind are not our own.
[00:23:03.406 --> 00:23:09.017]  Most schizophrenics claim that this is the case, but are told by doctors that they are crazy.
[00:23:10.496 --> 00:23:14.679]  Doctors who only give them lobotomies, electroshock, and drugs.
[00:23:15.759 --> 00:23:22.883]  And Marzynski has only seen schizophrenics recover once they start seeing these voices as an external entity.
[00:23:23.204 --> 00:23:28.427]  They then realize that they can actually resist them, and the voices go away.
[00:23:29.267 --> 00:23:38.273]  And so, while CERN is a great mystery, and a concern, the demons from another dimension may already be here, in our thoughts.
[00:23:39.392 --> 00:23:42.154]  So it's a good thing we all have free will.
[00:23:43.095 --> 00:23:47.095]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:23:48.095 --> 00:23:52.095]  Wow, and now Elon Musk is talking about it.
[00:23:52.095 --> 00:23:54.095]  Very, very interesting.
[00:23:54.095 --> 00:23:56.095]  We'll be back with all the huge news.
[00:23:56.095 --> 00:24:01.095]   InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today, Man.Video, those are the coordinates of freedom.
[00:24:01.095 --> 00:24:04.095]  Share them and defeat the New World Order. Share them now.
[00:24:04.095 --> 00:24:10.095]   I want to salute again the listeners and viewers, affiliates and sponsors of this broadcast.
[00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:10.970]  You change the world.
[00:24:12.392 --> 00:24:17.555]  The eruption of our quest for freedom has only begun.
[00:24:17.575 --> 00:24:24.621]  We are only in the beginning stages of the awakening of our species.
[00:24:26.762 --> 00:24:28.183]  The universe lays before us.
[00:24:31.786 --> 00:24:43.774]   Our ancestors are empowering us and our progeny will look back on us as heroes that with God's energy brought our species to the next level.
[00:24:46.235 --> 00:24:47.216]  Yeah, God's got me.
[00:24:48.357 --> 00:24:48.937]  To Haas.
[00:24:50.218 --> 00:24:50.818]  You got me.
[00:24:52.259 --> 00:24:52.840]  You got me.
[00:24:54.721 --> 00:24:55.301]  To Haas.
[00:24:57.102 --> 00:24:57.583]  Nein!
[00:24:59.404 --> 00:25:01.105]  No to Klaus Schwab.
[00:25:02.657 --> 00:25:03.077]  Nine.
[00:25:03.718 --> 00:25:09.801]  From Africa to Europe, from Latin America to North America, to Asia to Eurasia.
[00:25:11.101 --> 00:25:17.105]  Humanity is waking up and saying no to Klaus Schwab and no to the New World Order.
[00:25:20.566 --> 00:25:21.267]  All right, here it is.
[00:25:23.732 --> 00:25:36.540]  Dr. Fauci has issued his resignation letter after 40 plus years running different federal agencies, murdering people, blocking treatments, engaged in HIV rollout, the Wuhan lab.
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:41.603]  This murderous, discredited monster.
[00:25:44.945 --> 00:25:45.646]  This Hitler 2.0.
[00:25:46.106 --> 00:25:50.809]  This Bill Gates prosthesis.
[00:25:53.254 --> 00:25:54.095]  That's now resigned.
[00:25:56.896 --> 00:26:13.667]  I'm announcing today that I have been stepping down from the positions of Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Chief of NIAID Laboratory of Immunization, as well as the position of Chief Medical Advisor to President Joe Biden.
[00:26:14.226 --> 00:26:19.826]   I will be leaving these positions in December of this year to pursue the next chapter of my career.
[00:26:19.826 --> 00:26:29.026]  He now wants everybody to take polio shots again.
[00:26:28.995 --> 00:26:35.395]   You know, we told you that the climate was polio when you got paralysis from the poison shots
[00:26:35.395 --> 00:26:37.955]   and the record levels of heart attacks we'll be detailing next hour.
[00:26:37.955 --> 00:26:47.075]  What a monster.
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:48.040]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:53.471]  Polio vaccines are urged in New York as once-defeated virus lurks.
[00:26:54.131 --> 00:27:04.253]  Man, we got monkey pox, we got polio, we got record deaths all over the world where people took the shots and it's all supposedly, we're told, something else killing people.
[00:27:06.513 --> 00:27:07.874]  The hysteria continues.
[00:27:08.034 --> 00:27:13.855]  Los Angeles Public Health offers free COVID-19 testing for pets after the city records zero pet cases.
[00:27:14.175 --> 00:27:17.776]  All part of the biomedical tyranny and the hysteria.
[00:27:17.855 --> 00:27:18.855]  What a fraud.
[00:27:18.855 --> 00:27:24.855]  What a lie.
[00:27:24.855 --> 00:27:31.855]  They see us as a cancer.
[00:27:31.855 --> 00:27:34.855]  They see themselves as the cure.
[00:27:34.855 --> 00:27:43.055]   And no amount of fake fact checkers, no amount of hand-wringing, no amount of disinformation will ever put their fraud back
[00:27:43.055 --> 00:27:43.855]  together again.
[00:27:44.419 --> 00:27:46.800]  The system is in collapse.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:58.704]  Former Fox News political editor Chris Stierwalt blasts network for inciting black helicopter-level paranoia and hatred.
[00:27:59.285 --> 00:27:59.345]  Oh!
[00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:01.629]  Fox is bad.
[00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:07.631]  Because it doesn't 100% go along with the disinformation and lies.
[00:28:08.211 --> 00:28:09.791]  Brian Stelter signs off.
[00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:14.492]  Reliable sources of CNN left in limbo with basically no viewers.
[00:28:16.553 --> 00:28:19.734]  Oh, that's the fault of disinformation.
[00:28:20.334 --> 00:28:28.676]  They'd be popular if no one was there challenging their long history of lies and if they could just take Alex Jones off the air.
[00:28:30.285 --> 00:28:33.980]  They believe they could finally be a real boy again.
[00:28:38.902 --> 00:28:40.263]  What a disgusting joke.
[00:28:40.904 --> 00:28:56.437]  All their fake attacks, the hundreds of thousands of articles and thousands of TV programs attacking us in the last few years only made us more effective and only made world leaders tune in and all the major intelligence agencies who we're decompartmentalizing.
[00:28:57.217 --> 00:29:00.500]  We know more than they do because we're not inside their paradigm of brainwashing.
[00:29:01.441 --> 00:29:07.246]  I don't say that from a position of arrogance or a position of shmugness or bravado or chutzpah.
[00:29:08.868 --> 00:29:09.488]  Or hubris.
[00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:12.770]  I say it from a position of reality.
[00:29:16.293 --> 00:29:18.414]  We have a fighting chance against these people because of you.
[00:29:19.735 --> 00:29:23.137]  Because of our guests, because of your backing, this hardcore operation.
[00:29:25.639 --> 00:29:32.263]  That said though, the enemies of freedom aren't giving up.
[00:29:34.158 --> 00:29:40.883]  You know, Alexander Dugin had his own Russian world domination plan for Eurasia.
[00:29:41.984 --> 00:29:42.965]  And I had him on the show.
[00:29:43.305 --> 00:29:44.046]  Been on his show.
[00:29:44.506 --> 00:29:45.207]  Disagree with him.
[00:29:45.267 --> 00:29:46.868]  Said I wanted the West to work with Russia.
[00:29:47.328 --> 00:29:51.071]  I wanted a college of ideas and freedom.
[00:29:51.091 --> 00:29:52.812]  He said it's not going to happen because of your elites.
[00:29:52.852 --> 00:29:53.493]  Maybe he's right.
[00:29:53.833 --> 00:29:54.494]  Maybe he's wrong.
[00:29:54.534 --> 00:29:55.875]  And he and his daughter were in the arena.
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:01.283]  But she was blown up, as you know, a day and a half ago in a suburb of Moscow.
[00:30:02.003 --> 00:30:05.986]  They changed cars because he was going to talk to somebody and do an interview separately.
[00:30:07.227 --> 00:30:12.111]  And his Land Cruiser got blown up right in front of him with his daughter in it.
[00:30:12.131 --> 00:30:12.691]  It was terrible.
[00:30:13.351 --> 00:30:18.435]  And what's sick is then watching U.S.
[00:30:18.495 --> 00:30:26.181]  news and British news and other Ukrainian news celebrate and say she deserved to die because he's a, quote, fascist, because he's a nationalist.
[00:30:27.059 --> 00:30:35.846]  While separately claiming Putin and Alexander Dugin blew up his daughter, with no evidence.
[00:30:36.726 --> 00:30:42.531]  I have the London Telegraph, I have NBC News, I'm all saying, oh, Putin probably blew his daughter up.
[00:30:44.192 --> 00:30:48.575]  Now, they have free speech, and it's possible that could have been the case.
[00:30:48.956 --> 00:30:49.896]  They could have staged her death.
[00:30:49.936 --> 00:30:50.897]  I'm not saying that happened.
[00:30:51.698 --> 00:30:53.159]  Looks to me pretty real in the film.
[00:30:54.289 --> 00:31:00.333]  And Ukraine and the people running it, who call them fascists, but they're open Nazis, had said, we're going to kill Putin.
[00:31:00.993 --> 00:31:02.414]  Hell, Lindsey Graham's called for it.
[00:31:02.454 --> 00:31:03.154]  Others have called for it.
[00:31:03.395 --> 00:31:05.176]  And they said, we're going to kill Alexander Dugin.
[00:31:07.497 --> 00:31:11.259]  So they're celebrating killing her and saying they had the order out to kill her.
[00:31:11.279 --> 00:31:14.141]  Hell, they got the front man of Pink Floyd.
[00:31:14.161 --> 00:31:20.545]  He's on the same Ukrainian government website hit list.
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.883]  Mr. Waters, are they going to blow him up?
[00:31:28.125 --> 00:31:35.454]  And when they blow Waters up, God forbid, are they going to say he stages his own death?
[00:31:35.475 --> 00:31:41.543]  Remember, I've got a $49 million or whatever judgment, even though in Texas it's capped at way less than that, a few million.
[00:31:43.504 --> 00:31:45.385]  Against me for questioning a mass shooting.
[00:31:46.025 --> 00:31:48.486]  It's like a question to Jussie Smollett, WMB's in Iraq, so much more.
[00:31:49.107 --> 00:31:50.867]  But, oh, it's bad when I question.
[00:31:51.088 --> 00:31:51.808]  They went further.
[00:31:51.868 --> 00:31:56.290]  They're saying in London Telegraph, other publications, that Dugan murdered his daughter.
[00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:59.091]  I didn't say the Sandy Hook parents killed their kids.
[00:31:59.371 --> 00:32:02.493]  I said I thought it might not have happened, or there was a cover-up.
[00:32:02.693 --> 00:32:04.754]  Because there was a police cover-up because of malfeasance.
[00:32:07.815 --> 00:32:09.196]  Think about that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:09.798 --> 00:32:15.122]  No, the truth is in the Russian news, they're talking about a coup against Putin because he's not been hardcore enough against Ukraine.
[00:32:15.482 --> 00:32:21.307]  And the Russians in major polls are 90 plus percent wanting full on war, which I don't want.
[00:32:21.927 --> 00:32:23.268]  I'm not on the Russian side.
[00:32:23.589 --> 00:32:24.609]  I'm not on the U.S.
[00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:25.290]  side as the U.S.
[00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:26.431]  is occupied by globalists.
[00:32:26.931 --> 00:32:29.854]  I'm on the side of survival and not having nuclear war.
[00:32:31.914 --> 00:32:42.994]   But you've got all these armchair quarterbacks, who've never been in a fight in their lives, never shot a
[00:32:42.994 --> 00:32:49.953]   gun, most of them, never been in a war, certainly, who are saying that they want full-out nuclear
[00:32:49.953 --> 00:32:50.315]  war.
[00:32:50.535 --> 00:32:52.296]  Hell, we see it all the time, liberals in the New York Times.
[00:32:52.497 --> 00:32:53.658]  Let's just nuke Russia!
[00:32:53.758 --> 00:32:54.298]  Oh yeah!
[00:32:54.599 --> 00:32:56.581]  Then their submarines pop up and blow us all up!
[00:32:57.882 --> 00:32:59.784]  Man, this has got destruction written all over it.
[00:33:00.204 --> 00:33:04.288]  We've got some of those clips coming up, and more, and then two big guests.
[00:33:05.168 --> 00:33:07.048]  We've not spent enough time on the poison shots.
[00:33:07.068 --> 00:33:11.849]  It's trying to distract us from other issues, but the poison shots is the key issue.
[00:33:12.209 --> 00:33:12.789]  We'll be right back.
[00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:15.030]  We are go.
[00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:18.771]  Initiate resistance operations.
[00:33:19.871 --> 00:33:20.251]  Target.
[00:33:20.591 --> 00:33:21.031]  Globalist.
[00:33:22.971 --> 00:33:23.552]  We are go.
[00:33:24.972 --> 00:33:27.032]  And they are go against any resistance.
[00:33:29.593 --> 00:33:30.613]  We see the earth from here.
[00:33:32.671 --> 00:33:38.773]  Well, here's the BBC yesterday saying, hey, it's great to kill him, kill his daughter, kill Alexander Dugan.
[00:33:39.674 --> 00:33:40.074]  Liberal.
[00:33:40.154 --> 00:33:45.296]  But if you criticize the government, that's hateful or don't want a transgender man in the UFC beating up women.
[00:33:45.316 --> 00:33:45.756]  That's bad.
[00:33:45.796 --> 00:33:48.057]  But blowing up women in car bombs, that's liberal.
[00:33:48.097 --> 00:33:49.317]  Here it is.
[00:33:49.738 --> 00:33:54.759]  And to the extent we can actually find an ideologist of this war, he would be it.
[00:33:54.859 --> 00:34:06.128]   So attacking him really is an attack on the whole foundation, the foundational ideas that this war to travel in that car and then switch to another car.
[00:34:06.128 --> 00:34:09.447]  So it looks like he probably was the intended target.
[00:34:09.447 --> 00:34:12.688]  Now she would be a logical target as well.
[00:34:12.688 --> 00:34:17.128]  She basically carries on his legacy of fascism.
[00:34:17.128 --> 00:34:23.047]   She has been calling Ukrainians subhumans, calling for wiping them out, like her dad
[00:34:23.047 --> 00:34:25.047]  has been for quite some time.
[00:34:25.031 --> 00:34:33.276]  So to hit them both at the same time would be an especially attractive way of actually fighting this battle on the part of Ukrainians.
[00:34:33.597 --> 00:34:38.680]  It's possible that this was actually done by Ukrainian forces or Ukrainian agents in Moscow.
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:45.264]  It's also possible that this hit was carried out by anti-fascist, anti-war Russians.
[00:34:45.665 --> 00:34:51.448]  In either case, this has to give Putin pause, and it's certainly sending shockwaves to the Russian elite tonight.
[00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:58.372]  Oh, he's a fascist, though he opposed the Ukrainian actual Nazis that howl Hitler.
[00:34:58.392 --> 00:35:02.894]  Remember Hillary Clinton a long time ago now?
[00:35:02.954 --> 00:35:03.594]  How many years ago?
[00:35:03.614 --> 00:35:04.155]  Eight years ago?
[00:35:04.295 --> 00:35:04.815]  Nine years ago?
[00:35:05.635 --> 00:35:06.476]  They go into Libya.
[00:35:07.896 --> 00:35:08.917]  They have him sign a deal.
[00:35:10.017 --> 00:35:10.738]  They betray him.
[00:35:10.758 --> 00:35:11.758]  They overthrow the country.
[00:35:11.778 --> 00:35:13.019]  They torture Gaddafi to death.
[00:35:13.679 --> 00:35:15.300]  And now all of Africa is collapsing.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.301]  He was stabilizing it.
[00:35:17.541 --> 00:35:19.342]  They rape and torture him to death.
[00:35:20.728 --> 00:35:23.631]  And then Hillary comes and brags, we came, we saw, he died.
[00:35:24.212 --> 00:35:29.758]  Though she couldn't wipe her own ugly, fat, work-covered ass.
[00:35:30.959 --> 00:35:32.300]  I mean, it's just totally sick.
[00:35:32.681 --> 00:35:33.642]  Here's Hillary.
[00:35:35.484 --> 00:35:36.245]  Unconfirmed.
[00:35:36.265 --> 00:35:39.068]  Yes, we came, we saw, he died.
[00:35:41.764 --> 00:35:44.627]  Yes, we came, we saw, he died.
[00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:49.451]  Starting all these wars.
[00:35:50.172 --> 00:36:01.363]  Here is Lindsey Graham, right when Trump was getting in, with John McCain over there saying, we're going to war with the Russians, and then starting wars with the Russian ethnic areas that are almost 100% Russian.
[00:36:01.383 --> 00:36:04.506]  Again, I'm not for Russia attacking back, but they started the fight.
[00:36:04.846 --> 00:36:06.528]  Even the Pope says that, because it's true.
[00:36:07.731 --> 00:36:10.055]  Even the Pope says, three months ago, this needs to stop.
[00:36:10.336 --> 00:36:12.059]  The last start of this is going to cause World War III.
[00:36:12.319 --> 00:36:13.822]  This is dangerous, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:14.924 --> 00:36:17.669]  Even the New World Order Pope says this shouldn't be happening.
[00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:19.832]  Here's Lindsey Graham.
[00:36:20.859 --> 00:36:23.682]  I admire the fact that you will fight for your homeland.
[00:36:23.702 --> 00:36:24.823]  Your fight is our fight.
[00:36:24.843 --> 00:36:25.704]  2017 will be the year of offense.
[00:36:25.564 --> 00:36:31.564]  Your fight is our fight.
[00:36:31.564 --> 00:36:37.564]  2017 will be the year of offense.
[00:36:37.564 --> 00:36:43.564]   All of us will go back to Washington and we will push the case against Russia.
[00:36:43.418 --> 00:36:44.518]  Enough of our Russian aggression.
[00:36:44.538 --> 00:36:46.598]  It is time for them to pay a heavier price.
[00:36:46.538 --> 00:36:54.456]  Enough of a Russian aggression.
[00:36:54.456 --> 00:37:00.737]  It is time for them to pay a heavier price.
[00:37:00.737 --> 00:37:06.737]  Our fight is not with the Russian people, but with Putin.
[00:37:06.737 --> 00:37:10.657]  Our promise to you is to take your calls to Washington.
[00:37:10.664 --> 00:37:13.564]  Inform the American people of your bravery.
[00:37:13.384 --> 00:37:20.384]   Inform the American people of your bravery and make the case against Putin to the world.
[00:37:20.384 --> 00:37:32.503]  I believe you will win.
[00:37:32.484 --> 00:37:39.610]  I am convinced you will win, and we will do everything we can to provide you with what you need to win.
[00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:48.430]  [Russian translation]
[00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:54.430]   And we have succeeded not because of equipment, but because of your courage.
[00:37:54.430 --> 00:38:00.430]  [Russian translation]
[00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:12.729]   So, I thank you, and the world is watching. And the world is watching because we cannot allow Vladimir Putin to
[00:38:12.729 --> 00:38:14.430]  succeed here.
[00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:19.430]   Because if he succeeds here, he will succeed in other countries.
[00:38:19.796 --> 00:38:31.714]  I thank you very much, and the whole world is following this, and the whole world is following this, because we cannot allow Vladimir Putin to win here, because if he wins here, he will be able to do the same in other countries.
[00:38:36.021 --> 00:38:42.908]  Two years before that, George Soros bragged on Fareed Zakaria on CNN that he got U.S.
[00:38:42.948 --> 00:38:51.376]  funding, $5 billion, to overthrow the elected government, firebomb the government buildings, kill thousands of police, and start a civil war there.
[00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:56.773]  But I want to talk about real warfare, the real sisters being used.
[00:38:56.793 --> 00:38:59.996]  You know, boots on the ground is the final phase of a takeover.
[00:39:00.476 --> 00:39:12.587]  But weather modification and mass starvation and poison shots being given to our people and 5G and the cultural brainwashing and drag queen pedophile time, that's the real tip of the spear and it's not attacking the Russians.
[00:39:13.148 --> 00:39:13.849]  It's attacking them too.
[00:39:14.129 --> 00:39:15.030]  It's attacking us.
[00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:17.572]  We have an occupied globalist government.
[00:39:17.912 --> 00:39:19.253]  We don't have an American government.
[00:39:19.594 --> 00:39:29.943]  We have a government that cuts off our oil drilling, and cuts off our pipelines, and opens our borders, and ships in the fentanyl, and does all the other things they've been doing, and we're fed up with it, and we're tired of it.
[00:39:30.984 --> 00:39:33.886]  Our war is with the New World Order that's taken over.
[00:39:34.166 --> 00:39:35.227]  Russia's not expanding.
[00:39:35.448 --> 00:39:37.289]  Russia is encircled under attack.
[00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:42.581]   China, backed by the New World Order, Is it building electric cars?
[00:39:42.621 --> 00:39:43.881]  They're building normal cars.
[00:39:44.222 --> 00:39:45.302]  We're being shut down.
[00:39:46.162 --> 00:39:50.023]  Dodge just came out and said they're not going to make Hemi Hellcats anymore.
[00:39:50.163 --> 00:39:53.003]  They're going electric, which don't even work and are poisonous.
[00:39:54.463 --> 00:39:55.564]  It's incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:55.584 --> 00:39:58.224]  We're under total and complete sabotage.
[00:39:58.724 --> 00:40:05.245]  Here's a powerful clip of Senator Herbert Cole questions Robert Fletcher on weather manipulation.
[00:40:05.705 --> 00:40:08.846]  This is 28 years ago in a Senate hearing.
[00:40:09.966 --> 00:40:15.191]  And it's all real, it's all documented now, it's all going on like a backdrop, like the poison shots, any of it.
[00:40:15.211 --> 00:40:18.294]  We're not supposed to talk about it, but we are here.
[00:40:18.834 --> 00:40:19.815]  We are talking about it.
[00:40:20.075 --> 00:40:20.936]  We are discussing it.
[00:40:21.016 --> 00:40:21.997]  That's the real war.
[00:40:22.698 --> 00:40:29.144]  The open borders, the GMO, the poison shots, the weather modification, here it is.
[00:40:29.184 --> 00:40:50.146]   Another question, in the interview with the Los Angeles Times on April 21st, you said that the You told the Associated Press that the American government has created weather tampering techniques so that the New World Order will be able to starve millions of Americans and to control the rest.
[00:40:51.484 --> 00:40:53.883]  Would you explain what you were trying to say?
[00:40:53.883 --> 00:40:57.484]  Well, what I was trying to say is exactly what I said.
[00:40:57.484 --> 00:40:59.724]  There is weather control techniques.
[00:40:59.724 --> 00:41:04.524]   We have a complete package on that, which I did not bring, but I certainly will see to it
[00:41:04.524 --> 00:41:06.444]  that it is brought in for the record.
[00:41:06.444 --> 00:41:09.564]  Number one, the entire patents on the equipment.
[00:41:09.564 --> 00:41:14.604]   Number two, Senator Claiborne Pell's complete statement and story of his own
[00:41:14.604 --> 00:41:19.644]   that not only does it exist, but that we even utilize it as far back as the Vietnam War.
[00:41:19.644 --> 00:41:21.644]  You might want to touch base with Senator Perry.
[00:41:21.644 --> 00:41:24.644]  I just want to repeat before I turn to questions.
[00:41:24.185 --> 00:41:26.007]  So yes, but we do have all that information.
[00:41:26.167 --> 00:41:35.632]  You're saying the government has created weather tampering techniques so that the quote new world order will be able to starve millions of Americans.
[00:41:35.912 --> 00:41:36.493]  Worldwide.
[00:41:37.333 --> 00:41:40.135]  Millions of Americans and to control the rest.
[00:41:40.563 --> 00:41:41.024]  Yes, sir.
[00:41:41.184 --> 00:41:42.205]  And that's my belief.
[00:41:42.506 --> 00:41:50.056]  As bizarre as that sounds, when if somebody had told me that that equipment even existed 10 years ago, I would have thought they were nuts, sir.
[00:41:50.376 --> 00:41:53.320]  And at this point in time, we have all the documents to prove it.
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:42:00.221]   And if you think that 85 tornadoes takes place in the middle of our growing area by simultaneous
[00:42:00.221 --> 00:42:02.380]  accident, I'm sorry.
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:08.300]   With the equipment that's already set up internationally, and as bizarre as that is, it is proven and
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.300]  documented.
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.061]  We will supply you with those documents.
[00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:16.940]   As bizarre as that is, I would say that weather wars, and this is quoting actually Senator
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:22.420]   Claiborne Pell himself, that they are the greatest weapon ever created in the world,
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.221]  And that's the senator's own statement.
[00:42:23.951 --> 00:42:25.392]  So yes, I do stand on that.
[00:42:25.633 --> 00:42:26.373]  Thank you, Mr. Fletcher.
[00:42:26.393 --> 00:42:27.034]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[00:42:29.096 --> 00:42:36.825]  Anybody can type in Secretary of State William Cohen, 1998, admitting we have high-tech weather weapons.
[00:42:36.845 --> 00:42:38.446]  You can read the quote, it was in the Army Times.

[00:43:34.298 --> 00:43:37.398]  [music playing]
[00:43:38.398 --> 00:43:39.398]  [explosion]
[00:43:41.362 --> 00:43:49.842]   The cavalry for your immune system, the cavalry for your health, and the cavalry to keep InfoWars
[00:43:49.842 --> 00:43:54.522]  on the air with funding has now arrived, a 360 win.

[00:44:24.127 --> 00:44:29.590]  DNA Force Plus, finally back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com for 50% off.
[00:44:31.491 --> 00:44:34.392]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a symbiotic relationship.
[00:44:35.272 --> 00:44:39.574]  Supporting Infowars defeats the globalists, and this product does amazing things for your body.
[00:44:39.674 --> 00:44:40.414]  Take action now.
[00:44:41.475 --> 00:44:44.176]  Well, I don't know what will happen now.
[00:44:45.556 --> 00:44:51.739]  We've got some difficult days ahead, but I'm not concerned about that now.
[00:44:51.859 --> 00:44:54.940]  I just want to do God's will.
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:58.121]  And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain.
[00:44:58.141 --> 00:45:05.141]  And I've looked over, and I've seen the promised land.
[00:45:05.141 --> 00:45:15.141]   I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get
[00:45:15.141 --> 00:45:17.141]  to the promised land.
[00:45:17.141 --> 00:45:19.141]  We gotta come together.
[00:45:19.975 --> 00:45:24.156]  Whether you believe in that or not, you've got to decide whether you have dominion over yourself.
[00:45:24.716 --> 00:45:37.838]  I believe that the majority of the plain people of the United States will, day in and day out, make fewer mistakes in governing themselves than any smaller class or body of men, no matter what their training, will make in trying to govern.
[00:45:37.898 --> 00:45:47.680]  And you've got to decide whether it's God that's going to have dominion over you, that you get orders from, or whether some other human that's jacked into the evil force is going to have dominion over you.
[00:45:48.294 --> 00:45:59.003]  What we're talking about now is like a second industrial revolution, but the product this time will not be textiles or machines or vehicles or even weapons.
[00:45:59.323 --> 00:46:02.586]  The product this time will be humans themselves.
[00:46:02.606 --> 00:46:04.808]  Do we want to have a human plan or a post-human plan?
[00:46:05.408 --> 00:46:11.992]  Noval Harari and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates say humans are obsolete, we're scum, because they know we are their competition.
[00:46:12.312 --> 00:46:18.236]  They know that if we go for what we want and what God wants to have, they can't compete with that transmission.
[00:46:18.596 --> 00:46:20.017]  They can't compete with that blueprint.
[00:46:20.257 --> 00:46:21.778]  They can't compete without architecture.
[00:46:22.158 --> 00:46:24.460]  They can't compete with that master plan.
[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:26.000]  But I just see it now.
[00:46:26.501 --> 00:46:27.621]  It'll be so clear soon.
[00:46:28.101 --> 00:46:29.902]  Are you pro-human or are you anti-human?
[00:46:30.302 --> 00:46:33.383]  You are the human resistance to this alien takeover.
[00:46:33.803 --> 00:46:41.065]  And again, when I say alien takeover, I don't mean some little tinfoil flying saucer crashing in Roswell from Alpha Centauri.
[00:46:41.606 --> 00:46:51.409]  I'm talking about the transmission in the universe of God's order and God's will, or do you choose to serve the agents of death?
[00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:55.152]  And like Martin Luther King said, we're not going to judge them off what color they are.
[00:46:55.832 --> 00:47:00.274]  We're going to judge them off of their character, of their actions and deeds.
[00:47:00.975 --> 00:47:02.916]  So I'm going to say it right now, real clear.
[00:47:03.516 --> 00:47:06.778]  I love everybody, no matter what color your beautiful skin is.
[00:47:07.338 --> 00:47:09.839]  But I care about your heart and your guts and your mind.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.161]  And you're under attack by these Satanists.
[00:47:12.361 --> 00:47:13.521]  And they want to kill you!
[00:47:13.541 --> 00:47:15.222]  And they want to kill your children!
[00:47:15.242 --> 00:47:17.884]  And I say we set our differences aside.
[00:47:18.644 --> 00:47:28.090]  And I say we come together and we beat these people and we smash their technocracy and we build the future together and we can do anything with our real diversity.
[00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:30.731]  These enemies tell us all day about diversity.
[00:47:30.992 --> 00:47:34.374]  They mean divided and conquered groups of people separate from each other.
[00:47:34.794 --> 00:47:40.057]  This bill is supported by all of the Democrats, House and Senate.
[00:47:40.857 --> 00:47:42.839]  It's just a filibuster in a way.
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:57.646]  So, in a way, if you really truly want to honor Dr. King, don't dishonor him by using a congressional custom as an excuse for protecting our democracy.
[00:47:57.686 --> 00:48:02.608]  But I tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.
[00:48:02.768 --> 00:48:04.489]  I want unity.
[00:48:05.541 --> 00:48:13.003]  Under a code of freedom, and liberty, and justice, and coming together, and working together, and being strong.
[00:48:13.323 --> 00:48:21.646]  And that's what InfoWars is, and that's why the enemies of humanity hate us so much, because we love God!
[00:48:22.346 --> 00:48:23.886]  And God loves humanity!
[00:48:24.706 --> 00:48:27.687]  And I am a human supremacist!
[00:48:28.187 --> 00:48:39.067]  I am a human supremacist!
[00:48:39.111 --> 00:48:43.573]  That term will be the future war with the robots and the AI.
[00:48:43.813 --> 00:48:48.396]  What you're hearing now is the entire future and everything they tried to stop us from doing.
[00:48:48.816 --> 00:48:51.297]  Our supremacy will not end with this planet.
[00:48:51.917 --> 00:48:53.638]  We will people the stars.
[00:48:53.818 --> 00:48:54.759]  We will colonize.
[00:48:54.959 --> 00:48:58.600]   We will greed We will go interdimensional.
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.320]  We will unlock the secrets of the universe.
[00:49:00.601 --> 00:49:03.141]  God has laid them out like Christmas presents for his children.
[00:49:03.481 --> 00:49:14.085]  And I am extremely honored to be in the fulcrum and the heart of the fight to bring our race, the human race, in a race for the future.
[00:49:14.725 --> 00:49:15.846]  And we will break the enemy.
[00:49:16.427 --> 00:49:17.688]  We will break the pedophiles.
[00:49:17.948 --> 00:49:19.149]  We will break the Satanists.
[00:49:19.429 --> 00:49:25.295]  Because God already sent his own self down here to show us he could do it.
[00:49:25.895 --> 00:49:29.699]  God would never ask us to go through an obstacle course he wouldn't go through.
[00:49:29.979 --> 00:49:31.820]  And now we're going to go through what Christ did.
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:36.725]  And we're going to go through it and we're going to be destroyed but reborn on the other side.
[00:49:40.273 --> 00:49:47.717]  Well, philanthropist, executive director of COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund, and also the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation, Steve Kirsch is our guest.
[00:49:48.398 --> 00:49:51.720]  He's in Europe, so his internet's a little bit spotty, but man, he went on.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:58.884]  Tucker Carlson, oh, he had a fill-in guest, and just knocked it out of the park, exposing the real numbers, the latest developments with these poison shots.
[00:49:59.284 --> 00:50:05.688]  Here's a clip of that, and we'll go to him, get his response to Fauci, putting out his resignation letter today.
[00:50:05.728 --> 00:50:06.088]  Here it is.
[00:50:07.452 --> 00:50:12.073]  Steve Kersh is an entrepreneur, self-made success story, and joins us now to explain his reasoning.
[00:50:12.493 --> 00:50:15.614]  Steve, when did the Democratic Party start going south with you?
[00:50:17.974 --> 00:50:20.494]  Well, when they violated my trust, Brian.
[00:50:21.415 --> 00:50:28.196]  You know, they told the agencies, the FDA, the CDC, the NIH, said that these vaccines were safe and effective.
[00:50:28.596 --> 00:50:41.446]   And when I started seeing my friends die and be injured, and I started looking at the data, There was no question that this vaccine is the most dangerous vaccine ever created by man.
[00:50:41.786 --> 00:50:46.933]  It is a thousand times more deadly than the smallpox vaccine, and that's too unsafe for people to use.
[00:50:47.273 --> 00:50:51.218]   And I could not get even a single minute But you didn't stop there.
[00:50:51.238 --> 00:50:53.139]  You did your own research.
[00:50:53.219 --> 00:50:54.180]  What did you find?
[00:50:54.019 --> 00:50:59.579]   was that Ro Khanna gave me to a staff member who took two months to get back to me.
[00:50:59.579 --> 00:51:04.619]   And when I asked if she had read what I had sent her, she said, "No, it disagreed with the CDC,
[00:51:04.619 --> 00:51:06.179]  "so it's not right."
[00:51:06.179 --> 00:51:08.538]  And so I didn't really read it.
[00:51:08.538 --> 00:51:11.619]  So that's as far as I ever got.
[00:51:11.619 --> 00:51:12.460]  But you didn't stop there.
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:13.460]  You did your own research.
[00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:14.300]  What did you find?
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.259]  What did you find was effective?
[00:51:16.259 --> 00:51:18.858]  And what was the reaction when you put it out there?
[00:51:18.858 --> 00:51:26.878]   Well, what I found was that hundreds of thousands of Americans have been killed by this vaccine
[00:51:26.878 --> 00:51:29.219]  and millions have been injured.
[00:51:29.219 --> 00:51:31.139]  And, you know, there...
[00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:38.150]  Clearly, you are more likely to be injured or dead from the vaccine than if you were unvaccinated.
[00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:41.731]  So what they're saying, and what the reality is, is completely opposite.
[00:51:41.931 --> 00:51:46.812]  There's a conservative radio show commentator, his name is Wayne Root.
[00:51:47.252 --> 00:51:48.892]  He had a wedding eight months ago.
[00:51:49.472 --> 00:51:59.161]  And he had about half conservatives and half of his, they're all pretty much conservatives, okay, but half were vaccinated and half were not vaccinated.
[00:51:59.481 --> 00:52:07.047]  And he found that of the hundred people that were vaccinated, he had 26 people who were seriously injured.
[00:52:07.888 --> 00:52:09.530]  And he had seven people who died.
[00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:12.673]  And in the unvaccinated group, he had zero and zero.
[00:52:13.274 --> 00:52:17.178]  That is statistically impossible if the vaccines are safe.
[00:52:17.398 --> 00:52:17.598]  Right.
[00:52:17.698 --> 00:52:19.460]  So we can't verify those numbers.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:20.621]  These are the numbers that you have.
[00:52:21.001 --> 00:52:26.307]  But in turn, the Democrats who you funded exceedingly won't even return.
[00:52:30.148 --> 00:52:34.352]  Here we are, Steve Kersh joins us for the Balance of the Hour, but we do have numbers.
[00:52:34.372 --> 00:52:44.403]  We have insurance company numbers, we have government numbers, we have them all, he has them all in his sub-stack, he's going to lay out the facts that now even the CDC is saying, okay, the shot doesn't help, he doesn't protect you.
[00:52:44.923 --> 00:52:53.211]  All over the world, from Australia to Germany to the UK to Canada to the US, they're showing that people that have been injected are way more likely to actually get sick.
[00:52:53.792 --> 00:52:56.794]  Well, it's just like I said on Fox News, and, you know, Brian, who is the host, was caught off guard.
[00:52:56.814 --> 00:52:59.636]  And so he said, well, we can't verify those numbers.
[00:52:59.456 --> 00:53:02.736]   all this. You've been putting this out for a while but now the numbers have become
[00:53:02.736 --> 00:53:06.695]  crystal clear. Thanks for joining us. Lay it out for us.
[00:53:06.695 --> 00:53:14.375]   Well it's just like I said on Fox News and you know Brian who is the host was
[00:53:14.375 --> 00:53:19.856]   caught off guard and so he said well we can't verify those numbers. Well he was
[00:53:19.856 --> 00:53:24.175]   actually telling people the truth because Fox News has contractual
[00:53:24.175 --> 00:53:31.815]   commitments that don't allow them to speak poorly about the vaccines.
[00:53:29.898 --> 00:53:33.681]  So they can't say anything anti-vax on Fox News.
[00:53:34.221 --> 00:53:41.666]  And so they can't verify my numbers because if they did, they would have to be admitting that the vaccines are not safe and not effective.
[00:53:42.187 --> 00:53:45.129]  And that's a whole other scandal that's admitted but nobody talks about.
[00:53:45.169 --> 00:53:49.612]  Explain to people that a whole bunch of media outlets got bought off of contracts with Pfizer two years ago.
[00:53:52.010 --> 00:54:03.359]  Yeah, well, we know that the White House has spent a billion dollars on influencing media and giving money to media to promote these vaccines.
[00:54:03.959 --> 00:54:12.646]  And the drug companies, we don't know what the contracts say, but it's pretty clear that there was no interest at Fox in validating the numbers.
[00:54:13.106 --> 00:54:23.446]   Now, if what I said is true, If we really have killed hundreds of thousands of people, you would think that Fox News would be interested in covering that and looking at my data.
[00:54:24.027 --> 00:54:32.272]  So, after the interview, I talked to the producer and I said, hey, would you like to see the data?
[00:54:33.512 --> 00:54:34.853]  And there was no response.
[00:54:36.214 --> 00:54:37.615]  They don't want to see the data.
[00:54:37.915 --> 00:54:55.724]   But Naomi Wolf, so it's sort of the wolf is guarding the fox house now, And Naomi Wolf went on her sub-sac and she validated my numbers, but she didn't use any of the data that I supplied to her.
[00:54:56.305 --> 00:55:01.708]  She chose to use her own independent sources to see if she could verify what I said.
[00:55:02.428 --> 00:55:13.134]  And she found that what I said was true, both in hundreds of thousands of people being killed and millions of people being vaccine injured.
[00:55:13.815 --> 00:55:16.336]  Now, nobody else has even bothered to do this.
[00:55:16.837 --> 00:55:19.118]  So nobody else has contacted me for the data.
[00:55:19.638 --> 00:55:32.886]  No fact checker in the entire world will ask me for the data so that they could verify it and have a discussion with me that is recorded so that everybody can hear the discussion.
[00:55:32.926 --> 00:55:47.313]   So if they have any reservations at all, Let's talk about it on a recorded video so that there is no question as to what was said and what the responses were, because people always have questions.
[00:55:47.573 --> 00:55:52.134]  We want to make sure that that is transparent and in front of the American people.
[00:55:52.615 --> 00:55:57.096]  Now, no fact checker has volunteered to check my data.
[00:55:57.717 --> 00:56:00.798]  No fact checker has asked for my data.
[00:56:01.696 --> 00:56:14.563]  And, you know, so people are basically ignoring this, which is the only thing that they can do is to ignore this and hope that it goes away, because everything I said is verifiable.
[00:56:15.144 --> 00:56:18.506]  And what's more important is that people can verify it themselves.
[00:56:19.066 --> 00:56:21.767]  So, for example, I went on Nextdoor.
[00:56:22.168 --> 00:56:26.410]  Now, Nextdoor is not very friendly to people like me who are counter-narrative.
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:31.461]  And so my poll was up for one before Nextdoor took it down.
[00:56:32.062 --> 00:56:38.523]  But before they took it down, it showed that there were more deaths from the vaccine than from COVID.
[00:56:39.724 --> 00:56:45.326]  And that, of course, is why they took it down, because the data wasn't working in their favor.
[00:56:45.866 --> 00:56:51.267]  So they took it down as misinformation, even though it was a valid survey.
[00:56:51.547 --> 00:56:56.709]  Now, on Nextdoor, most of the people on Nextdoor are all pro-vax people.
[00:56:57.907 --> 00:57:06.694]  You know, they're completely blue-pilled, they're swallowing the narrative, and people like me who say that people are being killed, they, people like me, are ostracized.
[00:57:08.035 --> 00:57:08.315]  Sure.
[00:57:08.995 --> 00:57:19.723]  So, it is absolutely stunning when, even on a Nextdoor survey, that you find that more people reported vaccine deaths.
[00:57:20.224 --> 00:57:23.686]  I mean, those don't even exist in Nextdoorland.
[00:57:23.946 --> 00:57:26.228]  There were more vaccine deaths than there were COVID deaths.
[00:57:26.863 --> 00:57:40.835]  And of course, every survey I do, I always find that there are more deaths from people who were given remdesivir and had their ivermectin and other drugs that work with health.
[00:57:41.716 --> 00:57:48.642]  And so, what's really killing people is the hospital protocols for COVID and not COVID itself.
[00:57:49.230 --> 00:58:05.123]  I mean, if it was just COVID itself, you know, and people were told to treat it with ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and fluvoxamine and vitamin D and a bunch of other drugs that are proven to be safe and effective, there would be no pandemic.
[00:58:05.163 --> 00:58:11.008]  I mean, we can really stop this pandemic anytime we want, just with the snap of our fingers.
[00:58:11.108 --> 00:58:17.954]  All they have to do is one thing, do differently, which is to stop listening to the people that they're listening to now.
[00:58:18.664 --> 00:58:22.634]  And they should start listening to the people that they're censoring.
[00:58:26.328 --> 00:58:34.792]  We have insurance companies, we have government numbers, we have New Zealand news reports admitting that it's the vaccinated that are super sick, and now record numbers of death.
[00:58:34.892 --> 00:58:37.534]  Coroners are reporting, pathologists are reporting.
[00:58:37.674 --> 00:58:43.576]  I mean, you go off of the hardcore numbers, you've been saying this for a couple years now, now it's all confirmed.
[00:58:43.997 --> 00:58:48.819]  Now you have mainline people like the Santas coming out saying the vaccine doesn't work.
[00:58:49.319 --> 00:58:53.761]   It looks to me like, we're gonna come back from break and talk about this, but the wheels So, Fauci has resigned.
[00:58:53.641 --> 00:58:58.300]   The whole thing is collapsing and it's fair to say that. I want to get your view of that's right and where you see
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:01.800]   this going now because you've got Fauci resigning so much more
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:06.041]   Steve Kirsch Steve Kirsch dot substack dot com on Twitter at ST Kirsch
[00:59:06.041 --> 00:59:10.441]   and gab ST Kirsch stay with us We'll be right back with this man
[00:59:10.441 --> 00:59:14.260]   That's done probably more than anybody out there when it comes to actual statistics laying it out. Please stay with
[00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:17.240]   us So Fauci has resigned
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:23.691]   He's already had Congress and federal agencies tell him to save all his
[00:59:23.691 --> 00:59:24.121]  records.
[00:59:24.083 --> 00:59:27.404]  He ran the gain-of-function project calling it that.
[00:59:28.185 --> 00:59:33.067]  They said that they would blow up the old system of approval with a virus out of China.
[00:59:33.108 --> 00:59:38.170]  They said that three and a half years ago, about six, eight, nine months before the virus got released.
[00:59:39.191 --> 00:59:44.594]  And now here we are, big picture with Steve Kirsch, investigative journalist, entrepreneur, engineer.
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:49.563]  Breaking all this down, stevekirsch.substack.com.
[00:59:50.503 --> 00:59:55.627]  I want to get into the numbers and what the media doesn't want you to show, but our listeners have seen them, they understand that, and more and more is coming out.
[00:59:56.248 --> 00:59:57.148]  Hell, it's all over the news.
[00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:07.366]  Why is the former head of the CDC and the current head of the CDC and the head of Trump's task force, Berks, and all of them coming out saying, we knew it wouldn't work.
[01:00:07.386 --> 01:00:09.547]  That's a quote, obviously by Berks.
[01:00:09.748 --> 01:00:11.309]  And what are they doing?
[01:00:11.509 --> 01:00:13.130]  And what would you call this moment?
[01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:16.252]  Because for me, looking at it, it looks like they're scared.
[01:00:16.292 --> 01:00:17.292]  They know it's all coming out.
[01:00:17.833 --> 01:00:23.754]   Suddenly, almost no one's taking in 6% of Five-year-olds and up have taken the shot.
[01:00:23.754 --> 01:00:26.874]  Almost no one's giving it to six-month-olds, thank God.
[01:00:26.874 --> 01:00:29.834]  So even their own leftists now are waking up.
[01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:31.834]  And I just look at Twitter, Facebook, everywhere.
[01:00:31.834 --> 01:00:32.374]  I've been looking.
[01:00:32.374 --> 01:00:33.794]  It's just everywhere.
[01:00:33.794 --> 01:00:35.273]  People are saying, I'm paralyzed.
[01:00:35.273 --> 01:00:35.994]  My mom's dead.
[01:00:35.994 --> 01:00:36.954]  My kid's paralyzed.
[01:00:36.954 --> 01:00:37.454]  I died.
[01:00:37.454 --> 01:00:38.593]  My husband died.
[01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:45.154]   I mean, what in the world did Bill Gates and Peter Daszak and Anthony Fauci do?
[01:00:45.154 --> 01:00:47.314]  That's A. Where are we right now?
[01:00:47.314 --> 01:00:48.354]  This is a shorter segment.
[01:00:48.354 --> 01:00:49.874]  Next segment coming up.
[01:00:49.874 --> 01:00:52.234]  I don't think Trump's a bad guy.
[01:00:52.234 --> 01:00:56.354]   But Trump be damned if this all comes out and he keeps pushing the shot.
[01:00:56.354 --> 01:00:57.433]  I'm glad DeSantis isn't.
[01:00:57.433 --> 01:00:59.433]  I've made a lot of headlines being very critical.
[01:00:59.433 --> 01:01:02.314]  Trump, well, yeah, kids come first, not political alliances.
[01:01:02.314 --> 01:01:03.793]  So that's a lot I threw out there.
[01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:07.394]  Steve Kirks, tackle it however you want.
[01:01:07.394 --> 01:01:13.951]   Well, I think there's going to be a lot of finger pointing Like, I didn't know.
[01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:15.932]  It was not my fault.
[01:01:16.152 --> 01:01:17.113]  I did the right thing.
[01:01:17.213 --> 01:01:18.234]  I had no idea.
[01:01:19.655 --> 01:01:20.995]  That's what usually happens.
[01:01:21.336 --> 01:01:25.659]  We're seeing some of this in other countries as things break.
[01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:28.901]  So, I think the thing is collapsing.
[01:01:28.921 --> 01:01:33.164]  We're caught the wheels falling off the bus.
[01:01:33.704 --> 01:01:34.965]  And there's a good article.
[01:01:35.765 --> 01:01:37.827]  It's the pinned article on my sub stack.
[01:01:38.147 --> 01:01:47.131]   And it talks about, it goes through a hundred things that are things that are in front of people that can't be ignored. All of these,
[01:01:47.131 --> 01:01:52.881]   like the sudden adult death syndrome, like we haven't had that before as being a problem. And now
[01:01:52.881 --> 01:01:54.260]  it's happening all the time.
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:02:01.141]   We're seeing that young kids that are dying, we're seeing two and three year olds with, with
[01:02:01.141 --> 01:02:08.181]   who are having seizures. And these are not febrile seizures that doctors are familiar with.
[01:02:08.389 --> 01:02:10.551]  There's no fever involved in these.
[01:02:10.591 --> 01:02:11.971]  These are happening after vaccination.
[01:02:12.292 --> 01:02:28.941]  So there, there are things, there's, um, there is a, uh, someone who wrote me in, uh, from a, from a hospital saying that when they first went to the hospital, they would rarely hear these, uh, stroke, stroke, uh, alerts, uh, in the hospital.
[01:02:29.631 --> 01:02:38.279]  And then it became like every two hours in the hospital after the vaccines were being rolled out to younger and younger people.
[01:02:38.299 --> 01:02:49.589]  So it's pretty obvious to people that are paying attention that things are going very wrong and we're blaming it on the unvaccinated.
[01:02:49.929 --> 01:02:57.489]   But you see the hospitals, the people who work in the hospitals are telling me You're vaccinated and you check into a hospital?
[01:02:57.929 --> 01:02:59.952]  They don't record your vaccination status.
[01:03:00.352 --> 01:03:01.874]  So you look like unvaccinated.
[01:03:02.275 --> 01:03:08.443]  So all of these cardiac events and so forth are happening to the unvaccinated.
[01:03:08.523 --> 01:03:09.725]  And Steve, let's talk about that.
[01:03:11.026 --> 01:03:15.026]   vaccinated. It's not just all the sports people that are dying. It's not just you
[01:03:15.026 --> 01:03:18.146]   warning of this. Suddenly I see articles everywhere all over the world. It's
[01:03:18.146 --> 01:03:20.785]   normal to have heart attacks. Young people, it's normal for five-year-olds
[01:03:20.785 --> 01:03:25.426]   to have heart attacks. Yeah, suddenly microcarditis is off the charts from
[01:03:25.426 --> 01:03:29.826]  Australia to the U.S. I mean it's here. They did it.
[01:03:29.826 --> 01:03:36.946]   Yeah, you know, it's hard to ignore but they're saying that we don't know the cause.
[01:03:35.081 --> 01:03:39.662]  You know, oh, this is just really strange that this is happening and we'll look into it.
[01:03:39.962 --> 01:03:42.123]  But this is the greatest killer of all time.
[01:03:42.163 --> 01:03:45.583]  This is really, there's stuff, this is unprecedented.
[01:03:45.623 --> 01:03:47.784]  The numbers here are so large.
[01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:52.445]  This is greater than, this is killing people at a rate that's much higher than heart diseases.
[01:03:53.164 --> 01:03:58.110]  So it's the new number one killer, and yet the CDC is silent on all of this.
[01:03:58.490 --> 01:04:04.918]  And they don't want to be put on camera, don't want to go on the record, they don't want to challenge us.
[01:04:04.938 --> 01:04:14.671]   You know, there's someone at Carol Crawford, Who is the person at the CDC who's responsible for quashing the misinformation spreaders.
[01:04:15.071 --> 01:04:17.453]  And so she coordinates with the social media platforms.
[01:04:17.793 --> 01:04:18.433]  So I wrote her.
[01:04:18.794 --> 01:04:22.516]  I said, Carol, hey, you know, we, we got, I got a deal for you.
[01:04:22.596 --> 01:04:27.599]  You know, I'll get all the misinformation spreaders in a room and you can take them all down.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:35.104]  And let's just go through like your 20 hot topics and we'll go through our 20 hot topics and we'll just have a nice civil discussion.
[01:04:35.624 --> 01:04:45.991]  She's not interested in that, which tells me she's not interested in stopping the misinformation spreading because she knows damn well that we're not talking misinformation here.
[01:04:46.451 --> 01:04:50.734]  It would be exposed for them to go on camera.
[01:04:50.754 --> 01:04:56.278]  This is why we're being ignored by the FDA, the CDC, the NIH.
[01:04:56.358 --> 01:04:59.500]  None of these people will go on camera with any of us.
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:00.761]  It's not just me.
[01:05:01.161 --> 01:05:03.743]  They'll make excuses as to why they don't want to go on with me.
[01:05:03.783 --> 01:05:05.084]  They'll say, oh, I'm not a doctor.
[01:05:05.644 --> 01:05:09.669]  But you see, when I offer the doctors, they don't want to talk to them either.
[01:05:10.189 --> 01:05:14.234]  And so, they just don't want to talk about it at all.
[01:05:14.754 --> 01:05:19.399]  And mainstream media isn't asking them any of the tough questions here.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.942]  Like, if somebody dies, they...
[01:05:22.606 --> 01:05:27.290]  Ask what that person vaccinated and when was that person vaccinated?
[01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:30.292]  That just never gets covered in a story.
[01:05:30.612 --> 01:05:32.874]  And we see people in plain sight.
[01:05:32.894 --> 01:05:36.177]  I mean, look, I saw an Arab ambassador.
[01:05:36.557 --> 01:05:40.080]  He's speaking at a podium and he just drops dead.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:50.545]  But we've seen that over and over and over again after the vaccines rolled out and nobody is putting two and two together because they just don't want to know.
[01:05:50.565 --> 01:05:51.466]  Well, that's right, Steve.
[01:05:51.486 --> 01:05:52.166]  Stop right there.
[01:05:52.246 --> 01:05:55.208]  I mean, you've been talking about this for years, warning of it, now it's happened.
[01:05:56.168 --> 01:05:59.390]  The CDC in October 2000 predicted exactly this happening.
[01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:05.073]  Michael Yeadon, the former chief scientist at Pfizer, who just quit a year before, he came out and predicted it all.
[01:06:05.353 --> 01:06:07.154]  Tried to file emergency injunctions to the EU.
[01:06:07.294 --> 01:06:07.855]  They knew.
[01:06:08.803 --> 01:06:10.844]  So clearly, this is like a test.
[01:06:11.124 --> 01:06:15.225]  It's not like, oh, they killed a bunch of people and maimed a bunch, they didn't know, now they're covering it up.
[01:06:15.606 --> 01:06:16.106]  They knew.
[01:06:16.226 --> 01:06:18.387]  Why would they try something so incredibly bold?
[01:06:20.968 --> 01:06:24.889]  Well, I think that they were drinking the Kool-Aid from Tony Fauci.
[01:06:25.289 --> 01:06:31.332]  So, you know, first of all, Tony is the guy who funded the creation of SARS-CoV-2.
[01:06:31.992 --> 01:06:34.533]  If it wasn't for Tony, we wouldn't have a pandemic.
[01:06:35.106 --> 01:06:51.795]  And isn't it interesting, Alex, that right after we got the genomic sequence, within two days after the genomic sequence for SARS-CoV-2 virus was known, within two days, Moderna said, we have a vaccine candidate that we can use.
[01:06:52.375 --> 01:07:03.341]  Now, isn't that amazing that they could do that in just two days when it's taken them like six months to get a vaccine against one of the variants?
[01:07:03.852 --> 01:07:08.614]  Now, how could they do it so quickly for a new coronavirus?
[01:07:09.114 --> 01:07:11.294]  They weren't kind of in on it beforehand.
[01:07:11.595 --> 01:07:19.897]  And why is this 19 nucleotides, which is highly unusual, it does happen in nature, but it never happens in a virus.
[01:07:20.297 --> 01:07:22.238]  It's in a Moderna patent.
[01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:29.456]   And now it shows up in a Coronavirus, a beta coronavirus out of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[01:07:29.476 --> 01:07:30.556]  Steve Kirsch, stay there.
[01:07:30.716 --> 01:07:30.996]  Stay there.
[01:07:31.016 --> 01:07:32.017]  This is so critical.
[01:07:32.517 --> 01:07:33.818]  You've got so much knowledge.
[01:07:35.799 --> 01:07:40.561]  I want to get into the data they don't want seen, the insurance company data, what it means Fauci's resigning, and so much more.
[01:07:40.581 --> 01:07:43.062]  Everybody's got to go to Steve Kirsch's Substack.
[01:07:43.503 --> 01:07:45.303]  It is one of the most important things in the world.
[01:07:45.644 --> 01:07:47.284]  stevekirsch.substack.com.
[01:07:47.505 --> 01:07:48.105]  Go there now.
[01:07:49.285 --> 01:07:50.166]  I believe in humanity.
[01:07:51.741 --> 01:07:53.302]  I believe we can take on the globalists.
[01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:57.026]  I believe in independent journalists and doctors and scientists and you.
[01:07:58.067 --> 01:08:03.711]  And now we've got a real fighting chance thanks to you defending independent media like this operation.
[01:08:03.811 --> 01:08:06.694]  Please spread the word with this live show.
[01:08:06.834 --> 01:08:08.796]  Share the archive once it's banned on video.
[01:08:09.256 --> 01:08:10.457]  This is life-saving.
[01:08:10.517 --> 01:08:11.658]  The enemy's falling apart.
[01:08:12.119 --> 01:08:13.120]  Fauci's resigned.
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:14.921]  It's all coming out that the vaccine didn't work.
[01:08:14.981 --> 01:08:16.202]  It's coming out it's killing people.
[01:08:16.763 --> 01:08:18.985]  But now we've got to save the children they're coming after.
[01:08:19.565 --> 01:08:28.652]  That's why I told Trump he's got to do like DeSantis and say I was conned, I was lied to, like Bolsonaro, and decouple himself or he becomes a person aiding this.
[01:08:28.672 --> 01:08:30.173]  Sure, I've been a libertarian Republican.
[01:08:31.014 --> 01:08:31.815]  I agree with a lot of stuff.
[01:08:31.835 --> 01:08:36.378]  Democrats used to agree with anti-war and stuff, but I don't support Republicans if they're pro-death shot.
[01:08:36.398 --> 01:08:41.342]  Just like Steve Kirsch has been a big Democrat, big, big fundraiser, big successful tech company owner.
[01:08:41.763 --> 01:08:42.603]  He's broken with them.
[01:08:42.763 --> 01:08:45.586]  I mean, we just have to say politics does not exist.
[01:08:46.226 --> 01:08:47.807]  D's and R's do not matter.
[01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:49.728]  C's matter, meaning children.
[01:08:50.028 --> 01:08:51.849]  And the F matters, meaning our future.

[01:09:27.043 --> 01:09:32.784]  Steve Kersh continuing with the wheels coming off this and Fauci resigning and my question about Trump and the rest of it.
[01:09:33.404 --> 01:09:34.504]  What do we need to do?
[01:09:35.144 --> 01:09:36.605]  What do you think Trump should do?
[01:09:36.685 --> 01:09:37.945]  What can the average person do?
[01:09:37.965 --> 01:09:45.568]   And then also if you want to Go back into the numbers and the facts from the coroners and the undertakers and the hospitals and the insurance companies.
[01:09:45.588 --> 01:09:47.969]  I mean, this is just this is just incredible.
[01:09:50.230 --> 01:09:53.972]  Yeah, you know, Alex, all the numbers are consistent.
[01:09:55.172 --> 01:10:00.835]  You know, we can look at the death tolls and the injury tolls 10 different ways and we'll get the same results.
[01:10:01.605 --> 01:10:09.470]  And, you know, if I were Trump, right now Trump is treating this vaccine injuries and deaths as a third rail.
[01:10:10.051 --> 01:10:14.014]  And so he doesn't even want to go near it at all.
[01:10:14.094 --> 01:10:15.234]  He doesn't want to touch it.
[01:10:15.795 --> 01:10:17.876]  Doesn't want to take any questions on it.
[01:10:18.377 --> 01:10:19.978]  Simply wants to avoid it.
[01:10:20.518 --> 01:10:22.860]  That's not the right approach.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.201]  I think you're right.
[01:10:24.481 --> 01:10:28.443]  Trump's best approach is to say, hey, I was conned.
[01:10:29.084 --> 01:10:30.605]  I now know the truth.
[01:10:31.451 --> 01:10:49.095]  And the sooner he comes out saying the same thing that I've been saying, and I'm happy to supply him with any of the data on this, but as soon as he comes out with that, then he becomes a real hero for speaking the truth and for having the courage.
[01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:56.275]  To say what is reality because people are seeing this firsthand.
[01:10:56.696 --> 01:11:01.900]  Almost everyone now has a story and all the stories are negative.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:04.161]  There aren't any positive stories.
[01:11:04.282 --> 01:11:10.887]  I've been looking for a positive anecdote to say that, hey, I got 10 unvaccinated friends and 10 vaccinated friends.
[01:11:11.608 --> 01:11:18.211]  And it's only the unvaccinated people who are having injuries and deaths, but it's always the opposite.
[01:11:18.391 --> 01:11:23.113]  It's always the vaccinated group that is having the injuries and death.
[01:11:23.533 --> 01:11:26.134]  And that is becoming quite obvious to people.
[01:11:26.574 --> 01:11:30.256]  And so the sooner people wake up, the sooner this ends.
[01:11:31.272 --> 01:11:38.259]  And, you know, Donald Trump could actually be the hero here and end it worldwide.
[01:11:38.639 --> 01:11:42.603]  If Donald Trump comes out, because Donald Trump was a supporter of this, right?
[01:11:43.004 --> 01:11:46.267]  He was the one who created the vaccine in the first place.
[01:11:46.667 --> 01:11:53.434]  So if he comes out with the truth about the vaccine, boy, that's going to wake up a lot of people.
[01:11:53.514 --> 01:11:54.275]  And Steve, I agree.
[01:11:56.072 --> 01:12:01.074]  And I can tell you, on grassroots, his listeners, when I even defend him, my listeners are pissed at me.
[01:12:01.114 --> 01:12:02.655]  And I don't do what my listeners want.
[01:12:02.695 --> 01:12:03.515]  I do what I think is right.
[01:12:04.015 --> 01:12:05.356]  Trump's getting a lot of good people elected.
[01:12:05.456 --> 01:12:06.676]  I think overall he did a good job.
[01:12:06.716 --> 01:12:07.957]  He pushed the monoclonials.
[01:12:07.997 --> 01:12:09.938]  It turned out to really work.
[01:12:09.958 --> 01:12:10.658]  That was another gamble.
[01:12:10.698 --> 01:12:11.919]  He got conned by Fauci.
[01:12:12.299 --> 01:12:13.679]  He wasn't involved funding Wuhan.
[01:12:13.699 --> 01:12:19.182]  We know a few years into his administration, he was actually killing programs that Fauci was running for gain of function.
[01:12:20.602 --> 01:12:30.048]  I mean, I can look at the facts and tell you Trump didn't do this on purpose, but if he doesn't decouple and extricate himself soon, it begins to come to the point where he can't be the hero anymore.
[01:12:30.469 --> 01:12:32.710]  He's tied to this forever and we really see the setup.
[01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:33.371]  What do you think of that?
[01:12:35.652 --> 01:12:38.474]  Look, the truth has to come out.
[01:12:38.754 --> 01:12:41.856]  The truth always comes out sooner or later.
[01:12:42.177 --> 01:12:45.719]  You always want to be on the right side of history.
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.004]  And if you're Trump, you like to never be wrong.
[01:12:50.044 --> 01:12:54.428]  I mean, he doesn't like to admit he's wrong, but he has to in this case.
[01:12:54.829 --> 01:13:14.687]   But the point is that if he does that, then he then becomes on the right side of history, and that forces the Democrats To dig in deeper into this whole defending the vaccine, which will make them lose bigger and bigger and bigger over time, because the truth does come out.
[01:13:15.127 --> 01:13:24.614]  And it's amazing to me that these people who have left the CDC and the FDA, boy, they do not want to talk to anybody.
[01:13:25.255 --> 01:13:27.937]  And it's like I'm pleading the fifth.
[01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:29.810]  So think about this.
[01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:43.552]   The people that are leaving the FDA and the CDC do not want to talk on camera to anyone because they don't want to incriminate the That was my next question.
[01:13:43.572 --> 01:13:45.934]  You're the expert on this.
[01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:48.737]  Let me interrupt you, but now you're getting into the data.
[01:13:48.577 --> 01:13:55.137]   There is no way to explain the VAERS data, which is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.
[01:13:55.137 --> 01:13:56.097]  That was my next question.
[01:13:56.097 --> 01:13:57.856]  You're the expert on this.
[01:13:57.856 --> 01:14:00.457]   I'm gonna interrupt you, but now you're getting into the data.
[01:14:00.457 --> 01:14:03.457]   Just give us the main data points you get that anybody can check.
[01:14:03.457 --> 01:14:11.256]   Yeah, well, anybody can go to openvaers.com, and there's something called the Red Box Summaries.
[01:14:11.409 --> 01:14:18.350]  And if you go to that page at openvares.com, go to the Red Box Summaries, and you flip the slider to show U.S.
[01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:23.031]  only, because it shows you, by default, it shows you the worldwide numbers.
[01:14:23.431 --> 01:14:24.731]  You flip the switch to go U.S.
[01:14:25.272 --> 01:14:27.832]  only, you'll see around 14,000 deaths.
[01:14:28.452 --> 01:14:33.953]  Now, the problem there is that the 14,000 are underreported deaths.
[01:14:34.685 --> 01:14:37.948]  So, because people don't report to the VAERS system.
[01:14:38.648 --> 01:14:52.098]  And so, it turns out that for every death reported to VAERS, there are really about 20... Sorry, I'm getting into the... Let me... No, no, I see the sun shooting you right in the face.
[01:14:53.359 --> 01:14:54.140]  Yeah, all right.
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:57.302]  Now, I escaped that, the death blow here.
[01:14:57.362 --> 01:15:00.164]  But, yeah, if you look at the VAERS numbers, you'll see 14,000.
[01:15:01.445 --> 01:15:03.146]  You need to multiply that by 41.
[01:15:04.736 --> 01:15:11.438]  And 41 is the basic, it's a conservative under-reporting factor for the VAERS data.
[01:15:11.478 --> 01:15:15.419]  So it says that VAERS is only capturing about 2.5% of the events.
[01:15:15.839 --> 01:15:18.260]  So to get the real number of events, you have to multiply by 41.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:20.681]  And when you do that, you get half a million deaths.
[01:15:21.061 --> 01:15:28.043]  Now, some of those were COVID deaths, and some of those were just simply background deaths that just happened coincidental to the vaccine.
[01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:30.204]  But that's a very small number.
[01:15:31.392 --> 01:15:37.156]  What we know is deaths in 2021 and trending this year are way what they were the year before the vaccine.
[01:15:39.057 --> 01:15:39.937]  Oh yeah.
[01:15:40.058 --> 01:15:45.521]  And you know, from the embalmers themselves, the embalmers are seeing these telltale blood clots.
[01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:50.184]  We call them blood clots because they look like massive clots, but they're not blood.
[01:15:50.825 --> 01:15:51.445]  That's the thing.
[01:15:51.705 --> 01:15:52.946]  They're not blood.
[01:15:53.286 --> 01:15:59.068]  These things are clots in your arteries and veins, but they are not blood.
[01:16:00.108 --> 01:16:12.353]  So Mike Adams has been looking at these in his labs, and he's got one of the best labs for looking at this stuff, and he's finding that they're amyloid proteins and they're not blood.
[01:16:12.373 --> 01:16:14.694]  There's very little blood in these clots.
[01:16:15.214 --> 01:16:21.102]  The embalmers have never seen these clots before the vaccines rolled out.
[01:16:21.923 --> 01:16:24.186]  And they're reporting record numbers of customers.
[01:16:25.328 --> 01:16:32.598]  Not just the hospitals, not just the undertakers, not just the funeral homes, but the cemeteries are reporting record numbers of dead people.
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:40.464]  Yes, and so are the people who are manufacturing the coffins, especially the child-sized coffins.
[01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:43.806]  That business has gone up like gangbusters.
[01:16:43.846 --> 01:16:53.372]  I can't even get the right numbers because people don't want to speak on record because business is so great, they don't want to have it stopped.
[01:16:56.007 --> 01:16:58.689]  I'm going to try to give you the floor in the last 11 minute segment to talk about whatever you want.
[01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.749]  So much knowledge.
[01:16:59.829 --> 01:17:05.452]  I even forgot mainstream news is like record numbers of heart attacks in children, record numbers of coffins, record numbers of kids dying.
[01:17:05.512 --> 01:17:06.313]  No one knows why.
[01:17:06.413 --> 01:17:12.356]  I mean, it's so incredible that coffin manufacturers are hardly ever producing any little coffins.
[01:17:12.676 --> 01:17:14.017]  They're just cranking them way up.
[01:17:14.137 --> 01:17:17.079]  I mean, this is a Twilight Zone episode, folks, but it's really happening.
[01:17:17.419 --> 01:17:19.720]  Steve Kersh, stevekersh.substack.com.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:20.321]  Stay with us.
[01:17:20.341 --> 01:17:20.741]  We'll be right back.
[01:17:22.062 --> 01:17:22.743]  All right, welcome back.
[01:17:22.803 --> 01:17:29.350]  Final segment with Steve Kirsch, another very important special guest on the same topic, joins us next segment, next hour.
[01:17:29.370 --> 01:17:33.554]  But you don't like to speculate, and you've been exposing this for several years.
[01:17:33.614 --> 01:17:35.897]  Warning, it's all been confirmed that you were accurate.
[01:17:37.349 --> 01:17:40.828]   I want you to be able to in those last 10 minutes cover whatever topics or loose ends
[01:17:40.828 --> 01:17:45.788]   you want to hit and respond to the big controversy you on Fox News with Tucker Carlson and how
[01:17:45.788 --> 01:17:46.788]  scared they are.
[01:17:46.788 --> 01:17:50.948]   So spend some time on that but also just big picture as a citizen, as an entrepreneur,
[01:17:50.948 --> 01:17:54.908]   as an engineer, looking at the motive of this and them still doubling down.
[01:17:54.908 --> 01:17:58.387]   I mean obviously you said it earlier, the evidence all points to where premeditated.
[01:17:58.584 --> 01:18:02.065]  They had the patents, they had the rollout, they set Trump up to go along with it.
[01:18:02.445 --> 01:18:05.966]  Democrats, when the shot was first coming out, said, I don't trust any shot, he says.
[01:18:06.326 --> 01:18:07.887]  But as soon as he's gone, they love the shot.
[01:18:07.907 --> 01:18:10.287]  I mean, it's pretty clear to see what's happening here.
[01:18:10.307 --> 01:18:15.309]  I think it's pretty clear to see it's not going well for the Klaus Schwab's and Fauci's of the world.
[01:18:15.769 --> 01:18:18.830]  That's a lot to deconstruct, but just hit it however you want.
[01:18:20.665 --> 01:18:21.965]  No, there's so much to cover.
[01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:31.972]  You know, so Alex, do you know how much Tony Fauci is making every time a Moderna shot is delivered into someone's arm?
[01:18:33.874 --> 01:18:34.574]  I know it's a lot.
[01:18:37.096 --> 01:18:38.577]  Well, you see, that's the problem.
[01:18:39.337 --> 01:18:46.322]  So we have somebody who's directing this entire vaccination program who has a huge conflict of interest.
[01:18:47.383 --> 01:18:53.410]   You know, there's just Uh, that is not something that should be allowed.
[01:18:54.071 --> 01:18:59.939]  He should be, uh, we should know exactly how much he's making on these vaccines.
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:02.583]  And we're not allowed to know that.
[01:19:03.083 --> 01:19:08.685]   And when we try to get that information through Freedom of Information Act requests, It's denied.
[01:19:08.845 --> 01:19:16.771]  It's basically it is blacked out of the freedom of the answer that comes back on a Freedom of Information Act request.
[01:19:17.171 --> 01:19:24.617]  So how can you have the guy who created the virus in the first place and now he's getting paid?
[01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:29.039]  Every time the vaccine from Moderna is delivered.
[01:19:29.279 --> 01:19:37.744]  You know, the Moderna vaccine, most people don't know this, but the official name of the Moderna vaccine is the Moderna NIAID vaccine.
[01:19:38.024 --> 01:19:42.186]  So they're in cahoots with the government to push this on you.
[01:19:42.646 --> 01:19:49.370]  And the people at NIH, like Tony Fauci, make money every time you get the shot.
[01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:51.111]  This is why they're pushing it.
[01:19:51.451 --> 01:20:03.661]  This is why ivermectin doesn't work, and fluvoxamine doesn't work, and all these other drugs don't work, is because they're not supposed to work, because if they did work, then Fauci's not going to get paid.
[01:20:04.262 --> 01:20:05.583]  And we don't know how much it is.
[01:20:05.623 --> 01:20:09.326]  We don't know whether it's 10 million, 100 million, a billion dollars.
[01:20:09.846 --> 01:20:10.347]  We don't know.
[01:20:10.407 --> 01:20:11.447]  We're not allowed to know.
[01:20:11.788 --> 01:20:14.530]  Now, Congress isn't even asking that question.
[01:20:15.489 --> 01:20:21.969]   And Congress, the Democrats in Congress, any Democratic committee chairman in Congress
[01:20:21.969 --> 01:20:27.319]  can request from the NIH Tony Fauci's unredacted emails.
[01:20:27.319 --> 01:20:35.188]   And that would tell us the coordination that Fauci did in order to make it look like it came from
[01:20:35.188 --> 01:20:37.889]  nature rather than a lab leak.
[01:20:38.035 --> 01:20:56.068]  Because there was a set of emails that were not redacted where it showed that it was a lab leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and then all of a sudden with redacted emails we now then come to get the story that oh it came out of nature.
[01:20:56.488 --> 01:20:57.769]  With no new evidence?
[01:20:58.169 --> 01:21:05.675]  Well, you know, we could unlock what really happened there if somebody would look at Tony's unredacted emails.
[01:21:06.055 --> 01:21:17.823]  But isn't it amazing that we had a presidential commission looking into this and the presidential commission never asked the NIH for Tony Fauci's unredacted emails?
[01:21:18.464 --> 01:21:20.205]  It is amazing.
[01:21:20.665 --> 01:21:27.262]   And then, when there was an independent panel put together by the Lancet, to look into this.
[01:21:28.043 --> 01:21:30.406]  And Professor Jeffrey Sachs was the head of it.
[01:21:30.966 --> 01:21:36.012]  And he found that, oh, this virus came out of a U.S.
[01:21:36.232 --> 01:21:36.953]  bio lab.
[01:21:37.717 --> 01:21:39.037]  And, you know, which is true.
[01:21:39.357 --> 01:21:40.878]  I mean, it was it was part U.S.
[01:21:40.898 --> 01:21:53.121]  Biolab and part Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is why we were the WHO was never granted full access to look at what the Wuhan Institute of Virology was working on.
[01:21:53.621 --> 01:21:54.781]  That was not denied.
[01:21:55.041 --> 01:21:57.582]  You know, so there's this huge cover up.
[01:21:58.002 --> 01:22:09.786]   And it's amazing that no government in the world wants to know the source of the coronavirus that has Just decimated the entire world.
[01:22:10.166 --> 01:22:18.773]  Nobody wants to look at where it really came from, because Jeffrey Sachs has said, hmm, this is looking like it came from a U.S.
[01:22:18.813 --> 01:22:19.033]  lab.
[01:22:19.073 --> 01:22:29.480]  And as soon as he said that, then everybody's interest in finding the source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus just evaporated.
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.601]  Nobody wants to know.
[01:22:30.621 --> 01:22:31.742]  Gut level, gut level.
[01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:34.914]  Gates and all of them are saying more things are coming.
[01:22:34.974 --> 01:22:36.336]  Monkeypox, polio.
[01:22:36.837 --> 01:22:39.001]  I've seen a lot of evidence that's actually linked to vaccine side effects.
[01:22:39.021 --> 01:22:39.902]  They're just claiming that.
[01:22:40.644 --> 01:22:43.328]  What do you make of all the new fear-mongering and new calls for lockdowns?
[01:22:44.485 --> 01:22:55.989]  Well, you know, this is all self-created here, that the people involved are just manufacturing a crisis after crisis after crisis.
[01:22:56.029 --> 01:23:07.554]  And in fact, the more people get vaccinated, the more deaths we're going to have and the more injuries and the more crises we're going to have and the more vulnerabilities everybody is going to have here.
[01:23:08.034 --> 01:23:09.975]  So it's just feeding on itself.
[01:23:10.195 --> 01:23:13.036]   It is just It's almost never-ending.
[01:23:13.676 --> 01:23:19.698]  And the solution to all of this, to get back to normal, is always, well, it'll be in the next vaccine.
[01:23:20.038 --> 01:23:21.158]  It'll be in the next vaccine.
[01:23:21.278 --> 01:23:23.919]  Oh, there's a new vaccine that'll have Omicron in it.
[01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:39.491]  It's repeating the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result and people need to get wise that it's actually all these mitigation strategies that have made and perpetuated this pandemic.
[01:23:39.811 --> 01:23:58.332]   If we had just treated this virus with the Repurposed drugs like Farid and Tyson had a protocol way back in March of 2020 when this whole thing started and they have the number of deaths and hospitalizations they can count on one finger.
[01:23:59.133 --> 01:23:59.934]  Like it's zero.
[01:24:00.943 --> 01:24:12.614]  If you got treated early enough, they had no hospitalizations and they had no deaths, and the NIH was not interested in their early treatment protocols, and theirs is not the only one that's effective.
[01:24:13.054 --> 01:24:17.598]  So, we can end this entire pandemic any time we want.
[01:24:17.618 --> 01:24:18.779]  Steve, I totally agree.
[01:24:18.799 --> 01:24:19.540]  Let me ask you this.
[01:24:22.202 --> 01:24:24.164]  Why do you think Fauci resigned today?
[01:24:24.184 --> 01:24:26.105]  I'm seeing major heat on him.
[01:24:27.299 --> 01:24:28.881]  What can we do to bring these people to justice?
[01:24:28.901 --> 01:24:30.402]  Because for me, it's not about being vindictive.
[01:24:30.822 --> 01:24:33.505]  We've got to punish these mad scientists so they don't do this again.
[01:24:33.525 --> 01:24:37.909]  As Senator Paul has said, we know they've got stuff a lot worse than this thing they cooked up.
[01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:45.750]   Yeah, I think it's trying to like to pack the bags and get out of the country and disappear
[01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:48.989]  where he can't be found before people get wise.
[01:24:48.989 --> 01:24:54.430]  Those are, the wheels are falling off the bus here.
[01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:59.009]   And I've got an article on my Substack, stevekirsch.substack.com.
[01:24:59.009 --> 01:25:01.689]  It's the top article, it's the pinned article.
[01:25:01.689 --> 01:25:08.329]   And it talks about basically the false narrative is starting to fall apart and it's becoming very obvious
[01:25:08.329 --> 01:25:12.409]  people and you know you look at Twitter and somebody dies.
[01:25:12.965 --> 01:25:15.726]  And it's like, yeah, yeah, another vaccine death.
[01:25:15.746 --> 01:25:16.487]  They're covering it up.
[01:25:16.827 --> 01:25:21.588]  And doctors aren't allowed to speak out about this because they're going to have their licenses revoked.
[01:25:22.028 --> 01:25:24.549]  But, you know, there's some states where doctors are protected.
[01:25:24.989 --> 01:25:28.731]  And so doctors are starting to speak out and say, hey, take away my license.
[01:25:28.751 --> 01:25:29.931]  I'm going to do the right thing here.
[01:25:30.191 --> 01:25:32.612]  And it's even better when you're retiring.
[01:25:32.992 --> 01:25:35.053]  When you're retiring, then you can start to speak the truth.
[01:25:35.689 --> 01:25:38.590]  And, you know, so it's becoming apparent.
[01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:43.272]  I think Fauci is realizing that this thing is falling apart.
[01:25:43.512 --> 01:25:52.756]  You know, I've been emailing hundreds of people involved in the vaccine effort inside the CDC, and, you know, maybe that's starting to have effect.
[01:25:52.856 --> 01:25:54.596]  Maybe they're starting to... Oh, there's no doubt.
[01:25:54.656 --> 01:25:58.158]  You and Dr. McCullough and others are having some of the cheap effects we salute you.
[01:25:59.258 --> 01:26:04.505]  And I see Klaus Schwab coming out announcing 110,000 Info Warriors to counter vaccine disinfo.
[01:26:04.565 --> 01:26:05.847]  They've all been proven to be liars.
[01:26:05.907 --> 01:26:07.970]  Everybody knows everything they said wasn't true.
[01:26:08.050 --> 01:26:12.636]  So nothing is going to put their giant fraud back together again.
[01:26:12.656 --> 01:26:15.179]  And the more of us they target, the more people are going to stand up.
[01:26:15.199 --> 01:26:16.822]  Steve Kersh, people should find you're incredible.
[01:26:17.141 --> 01:26:20.641]  information at your sub stack and so much more.
[01:26:20.641 --> 01:26:23.141]  Thank you so much for your work.
[01:26:23.141 --> 01:26:24.641]  Thank you for everything you're doing.
[01:26:24.641 --> 01:26:30.141]   And I know you did it because you care about people, but still you're a hero and we congratulate you, sir.
[01:26:30.141 --> 01:26:33.141]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:26:33.141 --> 01:26:37.141]   And thank you for the opportunity to talk to the American people on your show.
[01:26:37.141 --> 01:26:40.641]   Something I don't get on Fox News is something I don't get on CNN,
[01:26:40.641 --> 01:26:44.141]   something I won't get in the Washington Post or any other mainstream media.
[01:26:44.528 --> 01:26:45.028]  Thank you, sir.
[01:26:45.548 --> 01:26:47.129]  And that's why InfoWars is important.
[01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:53.651]  We have long, hour-long interviews where people really get to talk and put on evidence, and that's why the system hates us.
[01:26:53.671 --> 01:26:54.892]  Steve Kersh, thank you so much.
[01:26:55.712 --> 01:26:58.894]  Edward Dowd, who's super articulate, been exposed to this for several years as well.
[01:26:58.914 --> 01:26:59.954]  I want to focus on the shots.
[01:27:00.354 --> 01:27:01.274]  They don't want us talking about it.
[01:27:01.535 --> 01:27:03.095]  He's going to join us on HSBC.
[01:27:03.175 --> 01:27:14.642]   He's going to be joining us to talk about the society, And the actuaries and what it's showing from the insurance companies, the latest information, the evidence is overwhelming with Edward Dowd.

[01:29:01.562 --> 01:29:01.782]  All right.
[01:29:01.802 --> 01:29:03.163]  He's only with us for 30 minutes.
[01:29:03.243 --> 01:29:06.185]  I've had a bunch of other economic and military news at the bottom of the hour.
[01:29:06.345 --> 01:29:08.287]  Edward Dow doesn't need any introduction.
[01:29:08.327 --> 01:29:12.029]  Worked at HSBC, BlackRock, and so many other big institutions.
[01:29:12.469 --> 01:29:14.251]  But he made a lot of predictions that have come true.
[01:29:14.591 --> 01:29:18.213]  That's what his job was, was a trends forecaster and stock picker.
[01:29:18.273 --> 01:29:21.936]  He's been going over the actual actuaries and numbers out of insurance companies and more.
[01:29:22.396 --> 01:29:25.158]  And now the wheels are coming off the establishment as Fauci resigns.
[01:29:25.218 --> 01:29:27.259]  And as they say, OK, the vaccine doesn't work.
[01:29:27.279 --> 01:29:28.300]  I know it does make you sick.
[01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:30.862]  This is blowing up in their face big time.
[01:29:31.602 --> 01:29:35.145]  But if you read the Spars War Game, it predicted this would all happen.
[01:29:35.165 --> 01:29:38.949]  So there's something bigger here about loss and trust in the system and more.
[01:29:39.029 --> 01:29:42.151]  So we'll get his deep expertise on this in the next 30 minutes.
[01:29:42.171 --> 01:29:43.212]  I'm going to try to give him the floor.
[01:29:43.573 --> 01:29:45.494]  Mr. Dowd, where should we begin?
[01:29:45.774 --> 01:29:51.740]  Dowd is, of course, can be found at Dowd Ward on Twitter and Getter at Edward Dowd.
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:53.441]  So good to have you here with us.
[01:29:53.461 --> 01:29:54.082]  Where do you want to start?
[01:29:55.546 --> 01:29:56.747]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[01:29:56.807 --> 01:29:58.368]  Great to be back.
[01:29:58.888 --> 01:30:12.638]  I love to start with the millennial chart that I put on famously brought on your show in March, where we showed my Wall Street insurance partner and I showed that into the fall of 2021.
[01:30:15.119 --> 01:30:22.159]   there were, from the CDC data, there were excess deaths in the millennial age group, age 25 to 44.
[01:30:22.159 --> 01:30:27.000]   And the millennial chart I said, that's, I'll talk about that in a second,
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.158]  but the millennial chart, there it is, there it is.
[01:30:31.158 --> 01:30:42.498]   You can see the millennials into the fall, ages 25 to 44, experienced a temporal 84% rise in excess mortality,
[01:30:42.559 --> 01:30:47.479]   which represented 61,000 individuals over the course of that year, which is a Vietnam War.
[01:30:47.479 --> 01:30:53.439]  The mandates occurred in August, September, October.
[01:30:53.439 --> 01:30:58.838]  That's that spike, 84% above normal, and that is it.
[01:30:58.838 --> 01:31:07.319]   Now, that was done with CDC data by my, Josh Sterling, who's starting to become public.
[01:31:07.841 --> 01:31:20.174]  He's a former Wall Street insurance analyst for Bernstein and that's a very top-notch research Wall Street firm, Alliance Bernstein.
[01:31:22.102 --> 01:31:24.483]  He discovered this, I made it famous.
[01:31:25.023 --> 01:31:28.464]  Now let me tell you what we learned on Wednesday last week.
[01:31:29.064 --> 01:31:36.567]  Last week, the Society of Actuaries, SOA, and they have a research institute, issued a report.
[01:31:37.487 --> 01:31:39.108]  And that's the second chart I want to show.
[01:31:39.168 --> 01:31:44.429]  This is Table 5.7 from the Society of Actuaries.
[01:31:45.170 --> 01:31:47.971]  This basically confirms our analysis.
[01:31:48.111 --> 01:31:51.917]   This represents 80% of the group life industry.
[01:31:51.957 --> 01:31:53.858]  This is the survey of their industry.
[01:31:54.219 --> 01:31:55.840]  These are actuaries doing this.
[01:31:56.501 --> 01:31:57.561]  You can see in Q3 of 2021, the red ages 25 to 34 and 35 to 44.
[01:31:57.621 --> 01:31:58.622]  That's the age group we looked at.
[01:31:58.442 --> 01:32:04.081]  the red ages 25 to 34 and 35 to 44.
[01:32:04.081 --> 01:32:05.921]  That's the age group we looked at.
[01:32:05.921 --> 01:32:09.360]  You can see a hundred percent represents normal.
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:12.082]  Above a hundred is excess.
[01:32:12.092 --> 01:32:17.958]  So, in those two age groups, it was 78% in Q3 and 100% in Q3.
[01:32:18.479 --> 01:32:20.801]  We came up with 84 for the combined group.
[01:32:21.262 --> 01:32:27.568]  So, what we want to say is that our numbers have been confirmed by the Society of Actuaries.
[01:32:27.928 --> 01:32:29.310]  Now, we knew our numbers were right.
[01:32:29.890 --> 01:32:40.393]  But it just literally gives credence to what we've been saying on your show in March to alert people on Bannon's show and other venues.
[01:32:40.814 --> 01:32:44.455]  So I just want to applaud you for letting us on here to present this data.
[01:32:45.435 --> 01:32:48.838]  Listen, some stations we have over 400 affiliates, but some don't carry this segment.
[01:32:49.359 --> 01:32:50.900]  So we need drum roll or something.
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:53.283]  This is horrible news, but it's also good that we can prove it.
[01:32:53.763 --> 01:32:58.348]  That you've been proving right since you were first talking about this years ago, and now it's all come out in the last year.
[01:32:58.968 --> 01:32:59.649]  What are they going to do?
[01:32:59.709 --> 01:33:02.132]  I want to come back and I want to just go through these again.
[01:33:02.732 --> 01:33:08.785]   But I mean, for those that don't know, The platinum standard of statistics is insurance actuaries.
[01:33:09.126 --> 01:33:10.107]  They don't mess around.
[01:33:10.487 --> 01:33:16.633]  And when the Society of Insurance Actuaries that's indexing all these insurance companies sees this, these are hard numbers.
[01:33:17.274 --> 01:33:19.536]  I mean, this is stuff you can take to the bank.
[01:33:19.616 --> 01:33:20.537]  Edward Dowd, stay with us.
[01:33:21.198 --> 01:33:23.981]  I don't know whether I want to clap, we're exposing the murderers, or throw up.
[01:33:24.001 --> 01:33:25.382]  I actually feel physically sick right now.
[01:33:25.402 --> 01:33:31.068]  I mean this is, we are, this is Hitlerian level stuff, or bigger, in our hands.
[01:33:31.609 --> 01:33:33.971]  And these sons of bitches knew exactly what they were doing.
[01:33:34.231 --> 01:33:36.193]  We'll be right back with Edward Dowd in 60 seconds.
[01:33:36.874 --> 01:33:42.720]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, the big international consortium of insurance company actuaries.
[01:33:43.681 --> 01:34:06.502]  Or they pool their numbers so they can accurately predict trends, has confirmed what Edward Dowd and previously a whistleblower, high level at top insurance actuary company, gave him info a year ago that he laid out on Steve Bannon's show, our show everywhere, confirming massive increase in deaths in young people right after the shots.
[01:34:07.142 --> 01:34:13.326]  And now the major international actuary group has confirmed his whistleblower's information and his info.
[01:34:13.346 --> 01:34:20.932]   And he said this, you know, a year ago on Bannon and other shows, he said, I have the whistleblower inside the actuaries.
[01:34:21.032 --> 01:34:22.734]  It's going to come out, but right now I'm going to put it out.
[01:34:22.934 --> 01:34:24.054]  Well, now it's confirmed.
[01:34:24.094 --> 01:34:25.876]  This is incredible news.
[01:34:26.196 --> 01:34:28.077]  But they know what they're doing.
[01:34:28.477 --> 01:34:29.278]  It's ongoing.
[01:34:29.338 --> 01:34:30.258]  Fauci's resigned.
[01:34:30.518 --> 01:34:31.819]  They're now admitting the shots don't work.
[01:34:31.839 --> 01:34:32.980]  They're now admitting they're hurting people.
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:34.461]  The wheels are coming off.
[01:34:34.581 --> 01:34:35.602]  What are they going to do next?
[01:34:35.702 --> 01:34:37.963]  I mean, this is an incredible moment in history.
[01:34:37.983 --> 01:34:43.087]  And then ask the question, why would global big pharma companies try a gamble like this?
[01:34:43.827 --> 01:34:45.208]  Or is there something bigger here?
[01:34:45.228 --> 01:34:51.777]   Because the SPARS document, a few years before COVID, 2025, 2028, really basic 2020, 2023.
[01:34:52.357 --> 01:34:59.260]  War games that a year and a half in, it turns out it doesn't work and kills you, destroys confidence in governments, and causes a global civil war.
[01:35:00.221 --> 01:35:03.582]  Yeah, and he's talked about that and forecast this two years ago.
[01:35:03.923 --> 01:35:06.264]  So he's a top trends forecaster, former top stock picker.
[01:35:06.824 --> 01:35:07.905]  Some stations just joined us.
[01:35:08.065 --> 01:35:12.467]  Recap the... I mean just, I don't even have words to describe how huge this news is.
[01:35:12.767 --> 01:35:13.507]  Take your time, sir.
[01:35:15.228 --> 01:35:19.258]   So, bottom line, The Society of Actuaries.
[01:35:19.418 --> 01:35:23.800]  Now, they're not going to come to the same conclusions that you and I have come to, and that's fine.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:25.841]  But the numbers are the numbers.
[01:35:26.381 --> 01:35:37.886]  We said on your show in February-March of this year that the millennials experienced a rise of 84% in excess mortality into the mandate quarter, Q3.
[01:35:39.971 --> 01:35:51.941]  That represented over the course of March of 2021 through Feb of 2022, 61,000 millennials, which represents basically a Vietnam War for the millennial age group, silent war.
[01:35:53.382 --> 01:36:05.872]  Then last week, the Society of Actuaries put out in Table 5.7, the excess mortality from their revenues, 80% of the revenues represented in this report, and there it is.
[01:36:06.914 --> 01:36:09.156]  Basically, confirming what we said.
[01:36:09.176 --> 01:36:11.319]  78% and 100%.
[01:36:12.059 --> 01:36:12.880]  We came up with 84%.
[01:36:13.601 --> 01:36:14.902]  So, that's that.
[01:36:15.323 --> 01:36:16.344]  The numbers are the numbers.
[01:36:16.684 --> 01:36:17.645]  We've been vindicated.
[01:36:17.685 --> 01:36:18.126]  We're right.
[01:36:18.566 --> 01:36:21.870]  But for folks that aren't an expert like you, lay out what those numbers mean.
[01:36:23.055 --> 01:36:24.636]  So basically, 100 is normal death rate.
[01:36:24.656 --> 01:36:30.140]  In the Q3, 78% more people died, more claims happened in the insurance industry for the ages 25 to 34, and 100% between 35 and 44.
[01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:31.080]  We analyzed 25 to 44.
[01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:32.041]  We came up with 84%.
[01:36:31.881 --> 01:36:38.640]   More people died, more claims happened in the insurance industry for the ages 25 to
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:43.201]  34, and 100% between 35 and 44.
[01:36:43.201 --> 01:36:45.560]  We analyzed 25 to 44.
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:47.001]  We came up with 84%.
[01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:53.181]   So 84% excess mortality in the claims of group life insurance companies.
[01:36:53.181 --> 01:36:58.201]   Now the thing to remember about group life, now that confirms the CDC data that we saw.
[01:36:58.838 --> 01:37:11.987]   Group life are claims against people that are employed in companies who tend to be Not drug addicts tend to be happily employed and healthy.
[01:37:12.447 --> 01:37:25.772]  So the number is just foot because the naysayers were telling me, well, well, Ed, those deaths occurred because of lockdowns and suicides and fentanyl overdoses and missing cancer screening treatments.
[01:37:26.457 --> 01:37:33.462]  My argument has always been, temporally, in three months, that was a dramatic rise in deaths.
[01:37:33.522 --> 01:37:38.186]  That was when Biden and corporations mandated vaccines.
[01:37:38.766 --> 01:37:43.230]  And you can see from the red highlighted by their own report, there was an event.
[01:37:43.530 --> 01:37:44.390]  What was the event?
[01:37:44.411 --> 01:37:45.571]  It was mandates.
[01:37:46.052 --> 01:37:47.553]  What did those mandates result in?
[01:37:47.673 --> 01:37:48.373]  Democide.
[01:37:48.494 --> 01:37:49.474]  Death by government.
[01:37:49.935 --> 01:37:51.676]  I've said it before and I'll say it again.
[01:37:52.216 --> 01:37:52.797]  Democide.
[01:37:53.979 --> 01:37:58.028]  And we've seen similar numbers around the world and even mainstream news is reporting now.
[01:37:58.349 --> 01:37:59.050]  Oh, it's normal.
[01:37:59.130 --> 01:38:01.014]  Record heart attacks in children and young people.
[01:38:01.395 --> 01:38:02.317]  Record blood clots.
[01:38:02.457 --> 01:38:04.281]  Oh, sitting at your desk is why you're dying.
[01:38:05.407 --> 01:38:14.410]  Look, again, I go back to the CDC document, October 2000, predicted adverse reactions, myocarditis, blood clots, over 30 things, and everything they predicted happened.
[01:38:14.650 --> 01:38:17.391]  So why would they put a report out predicting it and then do it?
[01:38:17.771 --> 01:38:18.291]  Big picture.
[01:38:18.311 --> 01:38:27.233]  I know you don't want to speculate, but as a citizen, as a human, Edward Dowd, because you did this over two years ago in a tweet, you predicted and you said this is about societal collapse.
[01:38:30.031 --> 01:38:31.312]  Look, I'm spitballing here.
[01:38:31.352 --> 01:38:40.080]  This is just, this is me predicting the future without having inside knowledge, but I am into game theory.
[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:42.802]  I'm into the Hegelian dialectic.
[01:38:42.922 --> 01:38:51.810]  I'm into all sorts of, uh, you know, if I was an evil person and I wanted to put in a control system, how would I do it?
[01:38:52.331 --> 01:39:10.663]   Well, you know, obviously, I would have some villains like Klaus Schwab, Harari, Fauci, Gates, some front men who think they're running the show, but they implement this and it creates a collapse in trust of institutions in society.
[01:39:10.683 --> 01:39:17.488]  And the goal is to introduce a central bank digital currency and some sort of social credit score and control.
[01:39:18.109 --> 01:39:26.381]   You can't sell that, so you get these clowns to do it in such a Comical, evil fashion that it's a joke.
[01:39:27.221 --> 01:39:29.002]  We then defeat these people.
[01:39:29.042 --> 01:39:30.063]  Fauci's resigning.
[01:39:30.103 --> 01:39:31.984]  You'll see these guys will fall.
[01:39:32.565 --> 01:39:37.268]  Then as they fall, remember we'll be in the middle of an economic collapse.
[01:39:37.368 --> 01:39:38.929]  Everyone will be afraid and fearful.
[01:39:38.949 --> 01:39:39.850]  There might be a war.
[01:39:39.870 --> 01:39:43.392]  There might be a Taiwan-Taiwanese war.
[01:39:43.672 --> 01:39:44.113]  Who knows?
[01:39:44.673 --> 01:39:45.774]  But events are coming.
[01:39:46.374 --> 01:39:47.355]  Again, I'm spitballing.
[01:39:47.895 --> 01:39:48.856]  I don't have a crystal ball.
[01:39:49.645 --> 01:39:54.251]  And then, out of left field, once these guys go off to the jail, some very handsome...
[01:39:55.214 --> 01:40:19.983]  Well-sounding reasonable people come up with a solution that looks great, but you know underneath the surface of it It's it's the that's what they wanted to implement anyways, but and we're done I totally agree with you and of course you don't like to speculate, but you're you know you're dead on Let's explain the Galean dialectic the easiest way to explain it Okay, you can go back to Hegel's analysis of it, which was previously used under other names But he quantified it the last 200 years.
[01:40:20.443 --> 01:40:26.850]   Let's take a wave pool and you want You've got engines that aren't big enough to create a wave to go over the wall.
[01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:35.973]  But you can combine the waves with two wave generators, and if you have a computer, you know how to crash the waves together to form a super wave to do what you want.
[01:40:36.293 --> 01:40:45.977]  That's the easiest way with dialectics is you're not just doing one action or two actions or five, you're calculating historically what those waves will then generate to create the actual outcome you want.
[01:40:46.297 --> 01:40:50.238]  So it's not one-dimensional or even two-dimensional or three-dimensional, it's four-dimensional thinking.
[01:40:52.145 --> 01:40:52.766]  Absolutely.
[01:40:52.846 --> 01:40:58.810]  And, you know, look, the classic description of Hegelian dialectic is problem, reaction, solution.
[01:40:59.610 --> 01:41:04.254]  And there's a bunch of different dialectics being run at the same time.
[01:41:04.274 --> 01:41:08.677]  The one we're talking about, you and I are talking about, is what's the problem?
[01:41:08.717 --> 01:41:14.341]  The problem is we've got these crazy Bond villain types who want to implement global control.
[01:41:15.161 --> 01:41:18.864]  The reaction is you and me and people getting mad.
[01:41:19.674 --> 01:41:44.033]   about that and you run a vaccine program that kills off all sorts of people and people get angry and then there's an economic collapse, a loss of trust in institutions and then what then the solution is some very nice well-meaning Well-spoken, good-looking people with a solution that's not as bad as the one that was pitched to us.
[01:41:44.093 --> 01:41:45.013]  That's right.
[01:41:45.033 --> 01:41:48.054]  You give them an angrier world as Klaus Schwab knows what he's part of.
[01:41:48.074 --> 01:41:54.177]  He's playing the part of the Bond villain, which he is, and then they give you the saviors from that.
[01:41:55.558 --> 01:41:55.978]  Correct.
[01:41:57.039 --> 01:42:02.001]  Now, this is all speculation on my part, but if I was writing the movie script, that's what I would do.
[01:42:03.783 --> 01:42:05.084]  But see, I don't see it as speculation.
[01:42:05.104 --> 01:42:07.485]  I've read Zabrinsky's books.
[01:42:07.545 --> 01:42:08.885]  I've read hundreds of books by these people.
[01:42:09.206 --> 01:42:10.446]  They all brag about this.
[01:42:10.946 --> 01:42:16.069]  And it's not speculation when you predict, you've done it, I've done it, hundreds of times and it comes exactly true.
[01:42:16.409 --> 01:42:21.411]  You just start seeing things from their perspective and then it's deadly clear once you get into Hegelian wargaming.
[01:42:22.932 --> 01:42:29.435]  Yeah, look, I'm speculating, but if I had to bet capital on my speculation, I would make a big bet on it.
[01:42:32.137 --> 01:42:32.817]  What comes next?
[01:42:35.339 --> 01:42:36.440]  So we got the midterms.
[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:38.820]  They tried monkey pox.
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:40.481]  I don't think that's going to fly.
[01:42:40.501 --> 01:42:43.822]  I'm worried about China.
[01:42:44.322 --> 01:42:45.903]  I'm worried about what's going on there.
[01:42:46.723 --> 01:42:49.964]  They hit a demographic cliff in 2020.
[01:42:50.904 --> 01:42:58.687]  And they have a debt problem, an internal debt problem, based on unproductive assets that they over levered into, which is real estate.
[01:42:58.707 --> 01:43:02.408]  So there's a real estate collapse, which is causing a banking collapse.
[01:43:03.406 --> 01:43:05.427]  And there's internal issues there.
[01:43:05.408 --> 01:43:09.008]   And when you have that kind of internal issues, you need an enemy outside of...
[01:43:09.507 --> 01:43:13.507]   That's right. So at the end of a bubble, and China's problem is the worst, but we all have the same problem.
[01:43:13.507 --> 01:43:16.507]   This is where you get these great resets. What does that mean straight ahead?
[01:43:16.507 --> 01:43:20.507]   Well, as Twitter has since been taken down, we go back over two years ago.
[01:43:20.507 --> 01:43:26.508]   Trends Forecaster and Stock Picker Edward Dowd predicted exactly what would happen.
[01:43:26.637 --> 01:43:28.897]  He's with us for one more segment ahead of the news blitz.
[01:43:29.338 --> 01:43:31.498]  The next two segments ahead of Gerald Cilente.
[01:43:32.399 --> 01:43:33.959]  But the book is finally in stock.
[01:43:33.979 --> 01:43:34.900]  Starts shipping next week.
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:35.580]  The Great Reset.
[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:36.320]  The War for the World.
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:37.660]  I know game theory.
[01:43:37.841 --> 01:43:38.681]  I know dialectics.
[01:43:38.821 --> 01:43:39.881]  I know how to analyze it.
[01:43:40.261 --> 01:43:42.022]  With a supercomputer God gave me my brain.
[01:43:42.042 --> 01:43:44.103]  And I know the enemy's plan.
[01:43:44.483 --> 01:43:45.283]  We know how to stop them.
[01:43:45.763 --> 01:43:52.055]   We're gonna have to, speaking of stop, Selling signed copies in a couple days because I got 10,000 books sold that are signed.
[01:43:52.375 --> 01:43:53.517]  I'm going to sign these suckers.
[01:43:54.378 --> 01:43:56.781]  It's going to be a full-time job to get this out in the next week.
[01:43:56.821 --> 01:43:58.364]  I'm going to spend hours a day doing it.
[01:43:58.884 --> 01:44:09.494]   And so, ladies and gentlemen, if you want a piece of history and to support the InfoWar, Order your signed copies at InfoWarsTore.com of The Great Reset and The War for the World.
[01:44:09.994 --> 01:44:12.616]  We're not even selling unsigned copies right now.
[01:44:12.656 --> 01:44:18.178]  Get those on Amazon because we're out of the books except for a few thousand copies we've got left.
[01:44:18.218 --> 01:44:25.122]  So get yours today at InfoWarsTore.com and keep us on the air as we fight the globalists toe-to-toe.
[01:44:25.462 --> 01:44:27.383]  So, Edward Dowd, I could ask you a thousand questions.
[01:44:27.423 --> 01:44:28.184]  I really respect you.
[01:44:28.204 --> 01:44:28.924]  You've been vindicated.
[01:44:28.944 --> 01:44:30.005]  I'm sad you've been vindicated.
[01:44:31.025 --> 01:44:34.606]  Other key points the next eight minutes you want to impart to the millions watching right now?
[01:44:36.347 --> 01:44:36.627]  Sure.
[01:44:37.187 --> 01:44:42.449]  Let me make a little more short-term predictions that might be helpful to people.
[01:44:43.989 --> 01:44:46.130]  The real economy is imploding as we speak.
[01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:51.011]  Since June, we've had what's called a stock market rally.
[01:44:51.171 --> 01:44:53.772]  So everyone is relaxing, thinking everything's fine.
[01:44:55.112 --> 01:45:08.115]   If I had to guess, Not 100% sure, but I'm fairly confident that the stock market rally peaked out last Tuesday, and we're now going to begin the descent into the fall and the midterms.
[01:45:08.435 --> 01:45:09.656]  And by the way, I have to interrupt.
[01:45:09.876 --> 01:45:14.819]  You were on six months ago and predicted basically exactly right the last downturn.
[01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:22.004]  Yeah, so I think there's a good chance that the rally from this summer ended last Tuesday.
[01:45:23.145 --> 01:45:24.766]  We've had a little bit of a sell-off.
[01:45:25.367 --> 01:45:28.270]  I'm not 100% sure, but fairly confident that it's begun.
[01:45:29.171 --> 01:45:30.011]  How do I know that?
[01:45:30.272 --> 01:45:41.382]  The Baltic Dry Index, which is the daily average prices of the shipping of raw materials across the globe, hit a new low last week, and that's a leading indicator.
[01:45:41.442 --> 01:45:43.864]  So the real economy is imploding.
[01:45:43.884 --> 01:45:57.921]   In the state of Hawaii, year to date, we've seen refi and resale Home applications dropped 51% and home resale alone has dropped 27%.
[01:45:58.341 --> 01:46:05.165]  So the real estate market's rolling over, the real economy is rolling over, building permits are rolling over.
[01:46:05.585 --> 01:46:16.331]  So even though the summer may seem like, oh, the stock market's okay, I'm here to tell you we're about to go into a bit of a tailspin into the midterm elections.
[01:46:16.371 --> 01:46:19.453]  How big do you think this will be compared to the last downturn that you predicted?
[01:46:21.075 --> 01:46:26.058]  So we lost about 20% into June from my call in January-February.
[01:46:26.078 --> 01:46:42.746]  If I'm right, and I don't want to get into the technical stuff of it because it's mumbo-jumbo, but if we take out the June low, we're looking at a 30-40% correction into the fall from the top in January.
[01:46:42.806 --> 01:46:45.687]  So from the June low, another 10-20%.
[01:46:46.908 --> 01:46:48.409]  And when do you see that slide starting?
[01:46:49.781 --> 01:46:51.523]  It's IBM started last Tuesday.
[01:46:55.107 --> 01:46:57.029]  What can we do to try to stabilize the planet?
[01:46:57.049 --> 01:46:58.591]  These dark forces want to destabilize it.
[01:46:58.611 --> 01:46:59.652]  What can an average person do?
[01:47:01.454 --> 01:47:14.173]   Well, the call to arms is not to live in fear, not to panic, to Align yourself with like-minded people, create human networks.
[01:47:15.315 --> 01:47:31.293]  You know, look, I don't have a crystal ball, but there may come a time where if you have relationships based on transactions, meaning you have security guards and you're rich and people are taking care of you, you better have some friends that will help you regardless of your money.
[01:47:32.326 --> 01:47:33.848]  I've done that here on Maui.
[01:47:34.208 --> 01:47:35.489]  I got in a car accident.
[01:47:35.509 --> 01:47:36.410]  There's a backup.
[01:47:36.490 --> 01:47:37.570]  I'm getting a car fix.
[01:47:37.931 --> 01:47:42.654]  Within two hours, I had two cars loaned to me that I can use indefinitely.
[01:47:42.694 --> 01:47:42.995]  Exactly.
[01:47:43.055 --> 01:47:45.897]  Human community is the most valuable capital in a collapse.
[01:47:48.862 --> 01:47:53.766]  If you don't have networks and you don't have friends, you should start thinking about getting them right now.
[01:47:54.046 --> 01:47:58.810]  Oh yeah, in our bankruptcy they'd ask me, why are you spending all your money keeping your crew employed?
[01:47:58.830 --> 01:48:01.191]  Because like, this crew is the most valuable thing I've got.
[01:48:01.211 --> 01:48:05.034]  I mean, people that know things and that are loyal is everything.
[01:48:07.196 --> 01:48:07.796]  Absolutely.
[01:48:07.936 --> 01:48:12.520]  I mean, you're doing what I'm doing on Maui and what other people are doing.
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:24.167]   I spoke before a group of wealthy individuals in June and I said, look, Just because you're wealthy and you have a transactional-based relationship, don't think that's going to protect you if the SHIT hits the fan.
[01:48:25.027 --> 01:48:28.348]  Those people are going to abandon you in a heartbeat.
[01:48:28.488 --> 01:48:38.692]  You have to have someone who's got your back because you have a real connection, a real human connection, and a trust, and a relationship that was formed before.
[01:48:38.712 --> 01:48:38.972]  That's right.
[01:48:38.992 --> 01:48:46.674]  This whole fake, empty, consumerist society is coming to an end, and we're going to get back to real relationships, or we're going to die.
[01:48:48.917 --> 01:48:49.898]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:48:51.659 --> 01:48:54.061]  You know, Alex, I'm very optimistic for the future.
[01:48:54.582 --> 01:48:59.325]  There's a renaissance coming, and I live on Maui.
[01:48:59.546 --> 01:49:06.892]  It's an island community of 140,000 people, and over the last year I've seen a shift in consciousness with some of my friends, not all.
[01:49:07.632 --> 01:49:13.735]  But a lot of people are starting to realize that the blue team, red team dynamic is nonsense.
[01:49:13.815 --> 01:49:16.437]  That the un-Vaxxed versus Vaxxed is nonsense.
[01:49:16.497 --> 01:49:22.279]  That black versus... People are starting to realize... By the way, I don't want to disagree with you because it's true.
[01:49:22.299 --> 01:49:24.841]  I was in Hawaii for two weeks a few months ago.
[01:49:25.501 --> 01:49:26.301]  Absolutely.
[01:49:26.321 --> 01:49:27.942]  And the community here is growing fast.
[01:49:27.762 --> 01:49:32.481]   about the natives. I mean, I was in multiple islands and literally mobbed, nothing but
[01:49:32.481 --> 01:49:36.722]   positive everybody buying my dinner, you name it, the police pulling over and waving at
[01:49:36.722 --> 01:49:42.002]   me the Hawaii, I think because they were under the worst lockdown. I think it forced people
[01:49:42.002 --> 01:49:43.002]  to wake up.
[01:49:43.002 --> 01:49:49.281]   Absolutely. And the community here is growing fast. The consciousness is taking off. So
[01:49:49.281 --> 01:49:56.002]   I am very optimistic that we've woken up enough people that even though we're going to go
[01:49:56.002 --> 01:49:59.641]   through some tough times, there's a renaissance on the other side. And there's going to be
[01:49:59.641 --> 01:50:04.722]   a lot of new leaders emerging, a lot of new ideas, a lot of ways of thinking about transacting
[01:50:04.722 --> 01:50:06.801]  and moving our society forward.
[01:50:07.116 --> 01:50:09.578]  Clearly, the healthcare system is going to be dismantled.
[01:50:09.679 --> 01:50:10.579]  That's a disaster.
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:14.683]  All these institutions are going to be razed to the ground and have to be rebuilt.
[01:50:16.271 --> 01:50:20.455]  Exciting things are coming, but it's going to be painful, chaotic, and just don't be in fear.
[01:50:21.195 --> 01:50:23.438]  As long as you know what's going on, there's no fear.
[01:50:24.539 --> 01:50:24.939]  I agree.
[01:50:25.039 --> 01:50:28.162]  In closing, you have a lot of gravitas.
[01:50:28.202 --> 01:50:29.863]  I really respect your intellect.
[01:50:30.804 --> 01:50:33.206]  What else do you want to get across the viewers?
[01:50:37.904 --> 01:50:38.385]  Two things.
[01:50:38.485 --> 01:50:40.186]  I want to pitch my book before I go.
[01:50:40.206 --> 01:50:41.428]  Oh yeah, pitch the book.
[01:50:41.468 --> 01:50:43.730]  If I come back home for a full hour about it, tell us about the book.
[01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:44.331]  I meant to do that.
[01:50:44.371 --> 01:50:45.312]  In fact, I apologize.
[01:50:45.572 --> 01:50:46.333]  The book's incredible.
[01:50:47.634 --> 01:50:58.846]  Yeah, so I've just signed a contract last week with Tony Lyons of Skyhorse Publishing to do a book called Cause Unknown.
[01:51:00.899 --> 01:51:03.961]  Epidemic sudden deaths in 2021 and 2022.
[01:51:04.481 --> 01:51:15.907]  Basically, we're going to put a human face on this because we all know that supreme fit athletes have been dropping dead across the globe and in the US since 21 began.
[01:51:15.927 --> 01:51:23.110]  We put cause unknown in quotes as kind of a joke because we know that we know what the cause is.
[01:51:23.351 --> 01:51:25.792]  And my thesis is that it's the vaccine.
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:37.564]  We're going to walk people through the anecdotes, the personal stories, and then we're going to present the evidence and the overwhelming evidence at this point that something definitely has changed and it's likely the vaccine.
[01:51:37.604 --> 01:51:43.146]  You don't have to agree with me, but this is a book that can be used to help convince your loved ones.
[01:51:43.186 --> 01:51:44.767]  When is Cause No None coming out?
[01:51:44.787 --> 01:51:45.607]  Because I'm going to sell it.
[01:51:47.187 --> 01:51:48.548]  It's going to be coming out November 8th.
[01:51:49.793 --> 01:51:50.173]  Oh wow.
[01:51:50.334 --> 01:51:51.835]  Please come back on again.
[01:51:52.455 --> 01:51:53.596]  Edward Dowd, thank you so much.
[01:51:53.656 --> 01:51:57.759]  Cause Unknown, Skyhorse Publishing, same folks putting out The Great Reset and The War for the World.
[01:51:57.799 --> 01:51:58.980]  I forgot we were going to talk about that.
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:00.341]  Come back on soon, brother.
[01:52:01.622 --> 01:52:02.403]  Thank you, my friend.
[01:52:02.903 --> 01:52:03.964]  Yeah, not name-dropping.
[01:52:04.004 --> 01:52:07.887]  He's been a friend of the broadcast for many years, been a frequent guest and co-host.
[01:52:08.447 --> 01:52:09.909]  I was just talking to Andrew Tait during the break.
[01:52:10.849 --> 01:52:11.590]  This is breaking news.
[01:52:11.610 --> 01:52:12.310]  It hasn't broke yet.
[01:52:12.911 --> 01:52:13.852]  YouTube disbanding.
[01:52:15.113 --> 01:52:19.196]  So as soon as the show's over, or as soon as I'm off in 30 minutes, I'm going to be talking to him.
[01:52:21.260 --> 01:52:25.183]  And they're coming after everybody that's pro-human and pro-family and pro-male strength.
[01:52:25.903 --> 01:52:27.485]  They see males as the threat to their takeover.
[01:52:27.505 --> 01:52:27.965]  Of course they do.
[01:52:28.265 --> 01:52:28.826]  Or the soldiers.
[01:52:28.886 --> 01:52:29.446]  Or the defenders.
[01:52:29.926 --> 01:52:30.647]  Or the army ants.
[01:52:32.188 --> 01:52:33.369]  That's coming up, man.
[01:52:33.489 --> 01:52:34.230]  Wow.
[01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:38.653]  You know, I wanted to get to all these clips, and if I set each one up, we'll never get to them all.
[01:52:39.694 --> 01:52:41.415]  So I've just got a whole string of clips here.
[01:52:41.975 --> 01:52:46.499]  The Tennessee House Committee on the Vax being way more subject to die.
[01:52:47.568 --> 01:52:52.501]  There's a whole bunch of these clips and I got some other economic and world news I want to hit, but here's a bunch of these back-to-back.
[01:52:57.004 --> 01:53:05.006]  700,000 people in the study in Israel, just so you know, that showed that the double vax were 27 times more likely to get reinfected.
[01:53:05.046 --> 01:53:10.387]  So it's not the vaccine, even if we just talk about that, it's not stopping infection, it's not stopping transmission.
[01:53:10.427 --> 01:53:18.588]  If you look at the studies in England, in Scotland, in the northern countries in Europe where they get real data, that they're actually the triple vaccinated, the most likely to die.
[01:53:18.648 --> 01:53:25.267]   So bottom line is that as we go forward, The natural immunity is long, broad, and durable.
[01:53:25.788 --> 01:53:32.809]  And I don't know if you mentioned it, but we have SARS-CoV-1 patients who still had immunity 18 years later.
[01:53:34.389 --> 01:53:35.849]  Let that sink in.
[01:53:35.869 --> 01:53:40.190]  18 years later, we still had immunity from SARS-CoV-1 to SARS-CoV-2.
[01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:42.711]  This is long, broad, durable immunity.
[01:53:42.751 --> 01:53:50.972]  So what I want to say in closing is natural immunity should be considered legally to be at least equal to vaccinated immunity, and immunity is likely life-threatening.
[01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:55.761]  For Peter Thompson, every day is a struggle.
[01:53:56.061 --> 01:53:59.403]  Diagnosed with COVID-19 in 2020, he's still battling.
[01:53:59.723 --> 01:54:03.225]  It's just over two years now and I've still got no taste or smell.
[01:54:03.505 --> 01:54:06.566]  He's one of half a million Australians with long COVID-19.
[01:54:06.826 --> 01:54:11.689]  His symptoms so severe, doctors have told him another bout of the virus could kill him.
[01:54:11.709 --> 01:54:16.491]  It's only got to take one person to have it and I'm gone.
[01:54:19.372 --> 01:54:26.775]  Fears made even worse by the latest figures, showing Australia is rapidly closing in on 10 million COVID cases.
[01:54:27.135 --> 01:54:30.396]  More than 13,000 have died since the start of the pandemic.
[01:54:30.716 --> 01:54:34.197]  Victoria, the first state to pass 5,000 fatalities.
[01:54:34.598 --> 01:54:36.438]  New South Wales isn't far behind.
[01:54:36.878 --> 01:54:40.920]  In Queensland, more than 1,800 people have lost their lives to the virus.
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:43.442]  What the numbers say is we're simply not winning.
[01:54:43.722 --> 01:54:44.903]  The virus is winning.
[01:54:45.223 --> 01:54:51.869]  Warning, as we emerge from the third and worst wave this year, it's time to change the way we think about COVID.
[01:54:52.029 --> 01:54:57.153]  We haven't quite grasped the fact that having lots of virus in our community is bad.
[01:54:57.753 --> 01:55:06.761]  Professor Crabb says despite increasing third and fourth dose vaccination rates, the virus is constantly mutating, finding ways of getting around that immunity.
[01:55:07.061 --> 01:55:14.724]   And so he believes there needs to be a greater focus once again on limiting the spread. We have to change to reduce trans. We got to
[01:55:14.724 --> 01:55:16.703]  lock you down forever. We made the virus.
[01:55:16.703 --> 01:55:22.703]   I'm a psychotic demon. The more times a person is infected, the higher their risk of developing
[01:55:22.703 --> 01:55:28.864]   long COVID. Something Peter Thompson wouldn't wish on anyone. There's places I'd love to be going,
[01:55:28.864 --> 01:55:47.584]   there's things I'd love to be seeing, but I also value my life. Rob Scott, 7 News.
[01:55:47.584 --> 01:56:10.304]  [Music]
[01:56:10.304 --> 01:56:16.624]   Rules for me, not for thee. Bubbles don't wear masks. I mean, you wear masks.
[01:56:16.624 --> 01:56:20.384]  It's all part of their elitism. Total, absolute scumbags.
[01:56:20.384 --> 01:56:30.143]  [Music]
[01:56:30.143 --> 01:56:34.624]   Something, man. When this corona thing was going on, I tried to fly, flew here from Romania on
[01:56:34.624 --> 01:56:35.464]  on Whizz Air.
[01:56:36.219 --> 01:56:38.560]  Because you can't get first-class flights into Europe.
[01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:39.600]  It's all just low-cost carriers.
[01:56:40.061 --> 01:56:40.761]  I'm flying Wizz Air.
[01:56:41.341 --> 01:56:42.121]  I have a mask on.
[01:56:42.381 --> 01:56:43.262]  Excuse me, sir, sir!
[01:56:43.302 --> 01:56:44.222]  Put the mask over your nose!
[01:56:45.282 --> 01:56:47.103]  I'm just an air stewardess, this minimum wage bitch.
[01:56:47.363 --> 01:56:48.744]  So I put my mask on my nose, da-da-da.
[01:56:49.244 --> 01:56:50.905]  Everyone was freaking out about masks.
[01:56:51.405 --> 01:56:55.367]  I had to fill in all these home office papers when I landed, all this crap, PCR test, blah-blah-blah.
[01:56:56.048 --> 01:56:56.948]  I thought about doing that again.
[01:56:57.308 --> 01:56:59.149]  So about two months later, I flew on a private plane.
[01:57:00.030 --> 01:57:04.112]  No mask, no PCR test, no home office paperwork.
[01:57:04.432 --> 01:57:05.633]  My pilots weren't wearing masks.
[01:57:05.873 --> 01:57:09.515]  When I landed at Biggin Hill Airport, the people who met me in the BMW, no one was wearing a mask.
[01:57:09.795 --> 01:57:11.356]  Nobody had a mask on, no one asked me to fill in shit.
[01:57:11.496 --> 01:57:11.936]  Do you know why?
[01:57:11.956 --> 01:57:12.697]  Because I was rich.
[01:57:13.567 --> 01:57:15.188]  Corona doesn't exist for the rich people.
[01:57:15.208 --> 01:57:18.651]  As soon as you pay 50 grand for a flight, now they'll trouble you then.
[01:57:18.971 --> 01:57:20.913]  They trouble the shit muncher on the Wizz Air flight.
[01:57:21.293 --> 01:57:23.014]  It's all a scam.
[01:57:23.434 --> 01:57:24.035]  All of it's a scam.
[01:57:24.075 --> 01:57:26.677]  And this is how the whole world has always worked and always will work.
[01:57:27.077 --> 01:57:28.698]  And people at the bottom just don't seem to get it.
[01:57:28.718 --> 01:57:29.419]  They don't seem to wake up.
[01:57:29.459 --> 01:57:34.143]  And they don't seem to wake up because the people in charge try very hard to keep them asleep.
[01:57:34.783 --> 01:57:38.086]  If you had a whole bunch of people who were your slave, why would you tell them the truth about the world?
[01:57:38.846 --> 01:57:39.487]  Why would you do that?
[01:57:39.547 --> 01:57:39.747]  No.
[01:57:40.327 --> 01:57:42.549]  When's the last time you went to school and learned how money works?
[01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:43.711]  Or banks work?
[01:57:44.091 --> 01:57:44.691]  Or taxes?
[01:57:45.072 --> 01:57:46.934]  Or any of the things that they use to control you?
[01:57:46.994 --> 01:57:47.114]  No.
[01:57:47.134 --> 01:57:48.635]  They teach you about photosynthesis.
[01:57:49.035 --> 01:57:50.337]  They don't want you to know anything!
[01:57:50.617 --> 01:57:52.018]  They don't want us to know anything!
[01:57:52.278 --> 01:57:57.583]  They just want us sitting there going, okay, he's a panda, and I stay in my house because of corona!
[01:57:57.964 --> 01:57:59.205]  Clap for the NHS!
[01:57:59.785 --> 01:58:00.926]  Like a performing seal!
[01:58:01.287 --> 01:58:01.727]  Like an idiot!
[01:58:02.888 --> 01:58:03.909]  And people are idiots.
[01:58:04.349 --> 01:58:05.491]  So they control them.
[01:58:05.511 --> 01:58:08.153]  And then they come to me and go, Tate, how'd you make all this money?
[01:58:08.173 --> 01:58:09.774]  I opened my eyes.
[01:58:10.475 --> 01:58:11.376]  I looked around me.
[01:58:11.416 --> 01:58:12.217]  I started to think.
[01:58:13.217 --> 01:58:14.939]  Things that people never seem to do.
[01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:18.142]  I don't know how they live in a dream for so long.
[01:58:18.522 --> 01:58:20.484]  I woke up out of the dream, right?
[01:58:21.064 --> 01:58:21.785]  But this is the truth.
[01:58:21.865 --> 01:58:23.366]  Governments are absolutely the enemy of the people.
[01:58:23.407 --> 01:58:23.987]  They always happen.
[01:58:24.007 --> 01:58:24.908]  They always will be.
[01:58:25.749 --> 01:58:26.029]  All of them.
[01:58:27.335 --> 01:58:28.675]  And that's why he's been banned.
[01:58:28.775 --> 01:58:29.916]  I just talked to Andrew during the break.
[01:58:29.956 --> 01:58:31.036]  He was just banned on YouTube.
[01:58:31.516 --> 01:58:32.317]  And more is about to come.
[01:58:32.337 --> 01:58:33.877]  I'll be talking to him as soon as the show ends.
[01:58:34.417 --> 01:58:35.918]  Or my hour in 20 minutes.
[01:58:37.078 --> 01:58:37.879]  Big developments there.
[01:58:38.719 --> 01:58:39.999]  But it's because we're popular.
[01:58:40.479 --> 01:58:42.460]  See, America wasn't perfect.
[01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:44.221]  But why did everybody want to come here?
[01:58:44.881 --> 01:58:49.122]  Why did America at the end of World War II have half the wealth of the world until the 1960s?
[01:58:49.603 --> 01:58:50.823]  4% of the world's population.
[01:58:51.363 --> 01:58:56.705]  More than 96% of the world, we had the wealth.
[01:58:59.244 --> 01:59:03.746]  4% of the world's population had more than half the wealth.
[01:59:06.207 --> 01:59:15.010]  Because America and our founders, they weren't perfect, but they were great compared to everybody else, said, hey, let's turn everybody loose and let everybody become successful and see what happens.
[01:59:15.070 --> 01:59:15.930]  And you see what happens.
[01:59:17.151 --> 01:59:22.493]  Cars and space shuttles and electricity and medicine, but now it's all been infested and taken over.
[01:59:24.841 --> 01:59:26.822]  I want you to know the tricks they've got.
[01:59:26.943 --> 01:59:28.784]  I want you to know about the private Federal Reserve.
[01:59:28.924 --> 01:59:30.485]  I want you to know about what they're up to.
[01:59:30.505 --> 01:59:33.327]  Because, man, I'm into humans.
[01:59:34.348 --> 01:59:37.150]  When I see people getting screwed over, I get pissed.
[01:59:38.490 --> 01:59:46.116]  See, I'm so confident that I think in a rising tide that raises all ships, as John F. Kennedy said, that I think I'm going to be one of the biggest ships.
[01:59:47.642 --> 01:59:50.424]  I don't want to rule a big pile of manure.
[01:59:50.444 --> 01:59:52.986]  I don't want to be sitting on top of a pile of skulls.
[01:59:53.926 --> 01:59:58.530]  I want to be sitting on top of you having a badass future and hailing me.
[02:00:00.331 --> 02:00:01.131]  And I'm hailing you.
[02:00:02.713 --> 02:00:11.879]  The globalists think I'm sick because I believe in you and I know we have unlimited resources and can go interplanetary anytime we want.
[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:14.481]  And I'm ready for that.
[02:00:16.087 --> 02:00:17.668]  You see, I feel bound to you.
[02:00:19.089 --> 02:00:21.510]  And when you're not successful, I feel like a pile of crap.
[02:00:23.651 --> 02:00:25.512]  When you're successful, I feel empowered.
[02:00:25.892 --> 02:00:31.495]  As you can have anything you want, like the Guns N' Roses song says, you just better not take it from me.
[02:00:34.178 --> 02:00:37.541]  And to a parasite, they hear that and they go, well, we better take it away from somebody.
[02:00:37.561 --> 02:00:37.821]  No, no.
[02:00:38.381 --> 02:00:39.782]  It's a non-zero-sum game.
[02:00:39.842 --> 02:00:40.603]  It's a win-win.
[02:00:41.023 --> 02:00:42.644]  It's a 360 win, the term I coined.
[02:00:43.005 --> 02:00:43.985]  It's unlimited, folks.
[02:00:44.286 --> 02:00:48.249]  The resources we have now is billions of times a hundred years ago.
[02:00:48.489 --> 02:00:49.730]  We'll be billions of times that.
[02:00:50.070 --> 02:00:53.232]  Our only problem is the decadence that comes from all this success.
[02:00:53.192 --> 02:00:59.192]   I mean God's just giving us the universe and giving us and everything and giving us this intellect
[02:00:59.192 --> 02:01:09.501]   These people want to cut your power off They want to screw you and your family.
[02:01:10.201 --> 02:01:10.461]  I don't.
[02:01:11.541 --> 02:01:12.261]  And I'm not a hero.
[02:01:12.381 --> 02:01:15.222]  I'm a selfish son of a bitch.
[02:01:16.702 --> 02:01:21.444]  And I want you to be so damn wealthy, a big giant wave of success I roll into.
[02:01:22.324 --> 02:01:23.584]  And I actually want you to succeed as well.
[02:01:23.624 --> 02:01:24.384]  I'm not the guy to get you.
[02:01:24.944 --> 02:01:26.805]  But that's because I'm spiritually with God.
[02:01:27.825 --> 02:01:32.506]  But if I actually pulled back, if I was a smart sociopath, I'd go, you being successful is good.
[02:01:32.746 --> 02:01:33.967]  But these people aren't smart.
[02:01:34.487 --> 02:01:35.067]  They're evil.
[02:01:36.374 --> 02:01:36.854]  We'll be right back.
[02:01:36.874 --> 02:01:37.254]  Stay with us.
[02:01:41.076 --> 02:01:42.237]  It's never going to get any better.
[02:01:42.637 --> 02:01:43.357]  Don't look for it.
[02:01:43.798 --> 02:01:44.898]  Be happy with what you got.
[02:01:46.059 --> 02:01:49.100]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[02:01:49.661 --> 02:01:51.301]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[02:01:51.722 --> 02:01:57.364]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[02:01:57.744 --> 02:01:58.945]  Forget the politicians.
[02:01:59.205 --> 02:02:02.447]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[02:02:04.045 --> 02:02:04.425]  You don't.
[02:02:05.265 --> 02:02:06.245]  You have no choice.
[02:02:06.626 --> 02:02:07.526]  You have owners.
[02:02:07.846 --> 02:02:08.886]  They own you.
[02:02:10.126 --> 02:02:11.407]  They own everything.
[02:02:11.427 --> 02:02:13.287]  They own all the important land.
[02:02:13.647 --> 02:02:15.407]  They own and control the corporations.
[02:02:15.427 --> 02:02:18.908]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls.
[02:02:18.928 --> 02:02:20.508]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[02:02:20.829 --> 02:02:25.670]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[02:02:25.830 --> 02:02:27.470]  They got you by the balls.
[02:02:28.965 --> 02:02:31.006]  They want obedient workers.
[02:02:31.446 --> 02:02:32.986]  Obedient workers.
[02:02:33.326 --> 02:02:46.051]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[02:02:46.091 --> 02:02:52.393]  And now, they're coming for your Social Security money, so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[02:02:53.866 --> 02:02:56.468]  It's a big club, and you ain't in it.
[02:02:56.808 --> 02:03:02.132]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[02:03:02.472 --> 02:03:03.352]  You better believe it.
[02:03:03.453 --> 02:03:05.334]  So what specifically did they do?
[02:03:05.774 --> 02:03:10.958]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand.
[02:03:11.158 --> 02:03:11.778]  A lot of money.
[02:03:12.399 --> 02:03:15.100]  You and I are not in the big club.
[02:03:15.461 --> 02:03:17.402]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[02:03:18.022 --> 02:03:21.745]  It's called the American dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[02:03:23.171 --> 02:03:24.632]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[02:03:25.012 --> 02:03:28.514]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[02:03:28.534 --> 02:03:32.457]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[02:03:32.477 --> 02:03:33.437]  They're not interested in that.
[02:03:33.698 --> 02:03:34.658]  That doesn't help them.
[02:03:35.018 --> 02:03:36.399]  That's against their interest.
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:37.340]  That's right.
[02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:42.503]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:03:44.444 --> 02:03:45.805]  So, that's where we are.
[02:03:46.145 --> 02:03:47.907]  And, I mean, I'm gonna tell you point blank.
[02:03:48.127 --> 02:03:49.387]  I'm not bragging, it's just true.
[02:03:50.428 --> 02:03:51.669]  I literally believe in humanity.
[02:03:53.536 --> 02:03:56.478]  I love you whether you're brown or black or white or pink.
[02:03:57.158 --> 02:03:58.559]  I love you whether you're a man or a woman.
[02:03:58.799 --> 02:04:00.260]  I just believe in our people.
[02:04:01.481 --> 02:04:05.223]  And that's why the enemies of humanity hate me so much.
[02:04:06.584 --> 02:04:08.325]  It's because I'm not with them.
[02:04:08.445 --> 02:04:11.087]  I don't want to join their parasitic operation, but I'll tell you right now.
[02:04:13.688 --> 02:04:15.509]  I can't take these people on without you.
[02:04:16.550 --> 02:04:17.330]  I am your champion.
[02:04:18.291 --> 02:04:19.112]  And haven't we proven it?
[02:04:20.252 --> 02:04:21.293]  And I'll just be point blank with you.
[02:04:24.264 --> 02:04:25.025]  I need your support.
[02:04:26.205 --> 02:04:27.326]  I need your psychic energy.
[02:04:27.366 --> 02:04:28.046]  I need your prayer.
[02:04:28.066 --> 02:04:31.469]  I need your word of mouth, and I need your money.
[02:04:33.390 --> 02:04:37.433]  I have put myself right in the crucible, and by the way, it's been a blessing, and I'm thankful to do it.
[02:04:37.473 --> 02:04:38.093]  I'm not a victim.
[02:04:38.453 --> 02:04:39.094]  I asked for this.
[02:04:39.194 --> 02:04:40.795]  I'm so happy, but I want to win.
[02:04:42.830 --> 02:04:43.591]  And you've been doing it.
[02:04:44.331 --> 02:04:45.112]  And I salute you.
[02:04:45.172 --> 02:04:47.774]  But just go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:04:47.834 --> 02:04:48.755]  Get DNA Force.
[02:04:48.795 --> 02:04:49.816]  Get Super Metal Vitality.
[02:04:50.116 --> 02:04:51.477]  Get Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:04:51.497 --> 02:04:53.459]  Get Vitamineral Fusion before it sells out.
[02:04:53.739 --> 02:04:55.060]  Get a copy of The Great Reset.
[02:04:55.561 --> 02:05:01.866]  I mean, we could probably finance a whole operation on signed books, except we're up to 10,000 signed books.
[02:05:02.226 --> 02:05:06.329]  We're going to the black right now, but I can't say I'm gonna sign these when I'm not.
[02:05:06.349 --> 02:05:07.330]  I gotta stop soon.
[02:05:09.372 --> 02:05:11.073]  So, it's the tale of two cities, folks.
[02:05:12.116 --> 02:05:17.697]  It's the best of times, it's the worst of times, but I've literally rolled up my sleeves to fight these people.
[02:05:19.257 --> 02:05:20.198]  And I believe in you.
[02:05:21.718 --> 02:05:25.939]  And I just need you to energize us as your champions in this fight.
[02:05:25.959 --> 02:05:29.700]  Because this isn't some baseball game that doesn't matter, or football game that doesn't matter.
[02:05:30.100 --> 02:05:32.200]  I'm not bashing you if you love football or baseball or basketball.
[02:05:32.220 --> 02:05:32.920]  Boy, I love it too.
[02:05:32.940 --> 02:05:34.561]  I love any good game.
[02:05:34.941 --> 02:05:35.961]  But those games don't matter.
[02:05:36.943 --> 02:05:38.743]  This is the real fight.
[02:05:39.584 --> 02:05:47.665]  You'll go spend hundreds of dollars on a UFC ticket or hundreds of dollars on an NBA ticket, and all I'm saying is, okay, great, but you better double down here.
[02:05:48.285 --> 02:05:49.606]  Because, man, I'm swinging for the fences.
[02:05:51.146 --> 02:05:54.827]  And I wish I knew how dire the situation was the last few years.
[02:05:54.867 --> 02:05:59.948]  I knew it was bad, but I got lackadaisical.
[02:06:00.008 --> 02:06:01.128]  I didn't focus on things.
[02:06:01.208 --> 02:06:02.368]  I didn't focus on bringing in money.
[02:06:02.868 --> 02:06:03.829]  We almost went bankrupt.
[02:06:04.469 --> 02:06:16.303]   I mean, we were in bankruptcy, but If we hadn't gotten that $8 million donation in Bitcoin, by the time we cashed out a little bit less than $8 million, when we came in it was like $9 million, but I waited to see if it would go up and went down.
[02:06:18.205 --> 02:06:22.989]  Whoever that person is saved us because I didn't know we weren't $3 million behind.
[02:06:25.512 --> 02:06:28.775]  We were $6 million behind.
[02:06:31.117 --> 02:06:33.079]  We were insolvent, my accountants told me right after.
[02:06:35.325 --> 02:06:39.528]  We paid off the debts of six million and we bought two million dollars of product.
[02:06:42.490 --> 02:06:43.231]  It's now coming in.
[02:06:44.152 --> 02:06:46.734]  But if we are good stewards of that, we can continue to be on air.
[02:06:47.014 --> 02:06:48.775]  You talk about God working in mysterious ways.
[02:06:48.795 --> 02:07:05.437]   I mean, if you don't know there's a God, who is this unknown donor that literally knew my finances better than me and gave us exactly the amount that if we played the cards exactly right, But that's how God works.
[02:07:06.558 --> 02:07:11.440]  I was sitting there with $5 million four years ago as our emergency backup money.
[02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:13.280]  For an operation like this, that's nothing.
[02:07:15.141 --> 02:07:18.682]  And I'm sitting there with it sitting in a bank account, and I go, what do I do?
[02:07:19.142 --> 02:07:25.145]  And literally God goes, get a real estate agent, buy an elite part of Austin, real estate's gonna go up a few years, sell it.
[02:07:25.425 --> 02:07:33.508]  I sold right at the top of the market, and for the time before that Bitcoin money came in, it was the money of that house sale.
[02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:40.109]   put back directly in this operation. The house doubled in value in three years.
[02:07:40.109 --> 02:07:44.510]  Big, beautiful, fancy, modern house. I couldn't stand it.
[02:07:44.510 --> 02:07:51.150]   My wife loved it. She got pissed when I sold it. But the point is, is that that kept us on air.
[02:07:51.421 --> 02:07:53.362]  That was God working through me with a good decision.
[02:07:53.742 --> 02:07:54.983]  And then that Bitcoin donation.
[02:07:55.023 --> 02:07:58.686]  Now the products are coming back in and you're funding us and we're still here and they can't stand it.
[02:07:58.906 --> 02:08:00.007]  They have big show trials.
[02:08:00.307 --> 02:08:01.228]  Thousands of articles.
[02:08:01.308 --> 02:08:02.288]  Hundreds of TV programs.
[02:08:02.308 --> 02:08:03.069]  That's conservatively.
[02:08:03.129 --> 02:08:04.790]  Thousands of TV programs.
[02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:05.911]  Hundreds of thousands of articles.
[02:08:05.951 --> 02:08:06.731]  Thousands of articles today.
[02:08:06.751 --> 02:08:07.172]  You've seen it.
[02:08:08.132 --> 02:08:09.473]  Like they're going to invade a country!
[02:08:10.374 --> 02:08:14.497]  Lying about us just to taint a jury to try to win a lawsuit to shut us down.
[02:08:14.737 --> 02:08:16.318]  They're not going to shut anything down!
[02:08:17.955 --> 02:08:23.076]  I can walk across the street and fire up a podcast that reaches the same amount of people today!
[02:08:24.717 --> 02:08:37.501]  But you won't have the Derren McBreams and the Greg Reeses and all these incredible Don Salazars and the Kit Daniels and everybody else that writes the articles and reports and does all this other amazing stuff.
[02:08:37.841 --> 02:08:41.942]  We don't want them to shut us down or slow us down at any level.
[02:08:42.990 --> 02:08:45.190]  And you can end their power over us right now.
[02:08:45.791 --> 02:08:50.091]  You can shut their asses down by financially supporting us at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:08:50.492 --> 02:08:57.953]  And again, I want to explain, there's 20-plus types of bankruptcies in America, and listeners hear this, and family calls me and says, too bad, you're shutting down.
[02:08:58.273 --> 02:09:03.354]  And I explain to them, I go, listen, and the only reason I do this again is because listeners still don't know what I want you to know.
[02:09:04.975 --> 02:09:06.675]  We're in Chapter 5 bankruptcy.
[02:09:07.557 --> 02:09:13.061]  Which is emergency reorganization for a business, and it's a business that funds this operation.
[02:09:14.662 --> 02:09:30.334]  And then under federal law, their goal to shut us down with these judgments won't work, because the federal court will look at the actual money we have, and the real numbers, not the made-up hundreds of millions they fraudulently say we have, and then whatever we actually have extra, they get.
[02:09:30.674 --> 02:09:34.057]  But all the crew stays in place, and all their operations stay in place.
[02:09:35.302 --> 02:09:38.383]  Just Alex Jones doesn't get money, which is fine with me.
[02:09:38.824 --> 02:09:40.104]  I didn't get into this for money.
[02:09:41.345 --> 02:09:43.486]  Money is nice, but I don't give a damn.
[02:09:43.926 --> 02:09:45.827]  Money on a scale of 1 to 100 is like a 2.
[02:09:46.987 --> 02:09:47.967]  Fighting tyranny is 100%.
[02:09:49.468 --> 02:09:51.029]  It's what I live for.
[02:09:52.469 --> 02:10:00.573]  So all I ask is that you keep us in the fight and understand that I'm not going to be stopped.
[02:10:01.817 --> 02:10:05.459]  And we got a lot of other irons in the fires and a lot of big cavalry coming to the aid.
[02:10:06.940 --> 02:10:14.905]  And if you think you've seen something from M4 Wars now, I am so fired up right now.
[02:10:16.766 --> 02:10:18.227]  I am, I am next level.
[02:10:19.387 --> 02:10:21.188]  And the Holy Spirit is so strong on me right now.
[02:10:21.228 --> 02:10:22.629]  The force is so strong on me right now.
[02:10:22.709 --> 02:10:23.290]  It's insane.
[02:10:23.670 --> 02:10:25.151]  And it's all your prayers that are doing it.
[02:10:25.471 --> 02:10:26.712]  And so I want to thank you.
[02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:46.214]  Just commit like you've done in the past and get a t-shirt at InfoWarsTore.com, get DNA Force, get bodies, get our great immune support, get Ultra 12, get X2, get Super Metal Vitality finally back in stock, and know that you are literally in an arm wrestling contest with Satan, and all I am is the arm.
[02:10:48.094 --> 02:10:55.476]  InfoWars is the arm, and I got a strong arm and a strong will, but the power to hold it in position is you.
[02:10:56.897 --> 02:10:58.458]  So when I'm struggling, you're struggling.
[02:10:58.478 --> 02:11:15.974]  When I'm in combat with these people, and they're doing everything they can, it's much easier to just stop sitting here at a stalemate with them, and for you to just to get behind us, pray tonight for us, pray tomorrow for us, spread the word about us, buy the products, and I'm telling you, we're gonna slam their hand down, we're gonna beat their ass.
[02:11:17.055 --> 02:11:19.237]  I smell nothing but victory.
[02:11:22.079 --> 02:11:22.660]  I'm not victory.
[02:11:24.070 --> 02:11:26.611]  But the spirit I got right here is victory.
[02:11:27.532 --> 02:11:28.793]  And I have never felt better.
[02:11:29.613 --> 02:11:31.754]  I have never felt stronger because of you.
[02:11:31.774 --> 02:11:37.457]  Because God works through souls, and you've done it, and you've done incredible things.
[02:11:38.278 --> 02:11:39.338]  And we're going to do this together.
[02:11:40.039 --> 02:11:40.479]  Think about it.
[02:11:40.599 --> 02:11:41.579]  We're the number one enemy.
[02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:43.741]  We're who the enemy hates more than anybody.
[02:11:43.781 --> 02:11:44.301]  Why is that?
[02:11:44.341 --> 02:11:53.386]  Because I'm real, and you're real, and together we create an energy loop, a synergy, an amplifying network of goodness.
[02:11:54.465 --> 02:11:56.426]  Just like they wanted to shut down the churches during lockdown.
[02:11:56.446 --> 02:11:58.448]  Because there were good people coming together.
[02:11:58.488 --> 02:12:01.750]  And we're doing it now, together.
[02:12:01.850 --> 02:12:05.732]  So go to InfoWarsTore.com and get great products.
[02:12:06.313 --> 02:12:07.934]  Sign up for all those, you get 10% off.
[02:12:08.514 --> 02:12:10.195]  But whatever you do, spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:12:10.215 --> 02:12:13.397]  Alright, I got some final news to hit, then Gerald Cilente.
[02:12:14.118 --> 02:12:20.121]  You've got all these leftists on BBC, ABC News, CNN, celebrating the murder of Alexander Dugan's daughter.
[02:12:20.862 --> 02:12:21.822]  Like it's a video game.
[02:12:22.983 --> 02:12:23.964]  But it's the real world.
[02:12:25.401 --> 02:12:32.188]  But in America and across the world, people know it's international child molestation rings that are running things.
[02:12:32.869 --> 02:12:36.533]  UFC fighter blasts Jimmy Kimmel, Hollywood and media as pedophiles.
[02:12:37.254 --> 02:12:44.401]  UFC fighter Joel Bauman put Hollywood and mainstream media on notice during a post-fight interview.
[02:12:44.461 --> 02:12:44.842]  Here it is.
[02:12:46.889 --> 02:12:56.537]  To all those doubting my NFT, you're looking at the guy that's the reason that college athletes and high school athletes are getting paid today.
[02:12:58.118 --> 02:12:59.939]  Mr. Influencer to Influencers.
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:03.642]  Secondly, Jimmy Kimmel, viral this.
[02:13:04.463 --> 02:13:07.305]  I fight to eradicate childhood malnutrition from the planet.
[02:13:08.026 --> 02:13:14.591]  And until they release the flight logs, you, the mainstream media, Hollywood, are all pedophiles to me.
[02:13:14.752 --> 02:13:19.752]   eat s*** [cheering]
[02:13:19.752 --> 02:13:27.752]   or amicancelledyet.com everybody gets it's a rebellion against the pedophiles
[02:13:28.167 --> 02:13:29.909]  Stephen Colbert flew on the pedophile flights.
[02:13:31.129 --> 02:13:32.150]  The head of Atlantic Monthly.
[02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:32.871]  All of them.
[02:13:34.672 --> 02:13:36.573]  Yeah, humanity knows who you are, parasites.
[02:13:37.814 --> 02:13:41.076]  We got your numbers, so keep pushing us around, keep bullying us.
[02:13:41.797 --> 02:13:42.677]  Keep playing your games.
[02:13:45.099 --> 02:13:49.091]   Queue up that little promo from The court hearing.
[02:13:49.791 --> 02:13:52.212]  Where they say, are you claiming the government's running kids?
[02:13:53.392 --> 02:13:58.173]  And I say, you mean like Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein, or Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton?
[02:14:00.233 --> 02:14:06.234]  They cannot stand against us when we start speaking out, whether you're a UFC champ or a school teacher.
[02:14:06.694 --> 02:14:08.715]  Whether you're an auto mechanic or a police officer.
[02:14:08.895 --> 02:14:10.435]  Stop submitting.
[02:14:10.995 --> 02:14:12.335]  Stop being bullied.
[02:14:12.375 --> 02:14:14.396]  I go out in public, I'll shake 20 hands.
[02:14:16.254 --> 02:14:18.275]  Before somebody says, F you Alex Jones, I hate you.
[02:14:18.975 --> 02:14:21.336]  And I'll be sitting there eating a dinner when they come over and yell at me at my dinner.
[02:14:22.836 --> 02:14:24.357]  You, I can't believe you're even out in public.
[02:14:24.377 --> 02:14:24.977]  Aren't you ashamed?
[02:14:24.997 --> 02:14:26.678]  I go, no, I'm ashamed of scum like you that like me.
[02:14:26.978 --> 02:14:28.939]  Boom, this food is so much better now.
[02:14:30.599 --> 02:14:33.781]  Because I am done rolling over.
[02:14:35.141 --> 02:14:36.882]  I am done bowing to these scum.
[02:14:38.683 --> 02:14:44.925]  They're trash who have nothing that bully us and we continue to submit to them.
[02:14:46.980 --> 02:14:49.223]  At a certain point, we've got to stop kneeling.
[02:14:50.264 --> 02:14:52.347]  At a certain point, we've got to stop bowing.
[02:14:52.787 --> 02:14:54.930]  At a certain point, we've got to stop submitting.
[02:14:54.950 --> 02:15:01.478]  And we've got to come up for air and say, I'm done with the New World Order.
[02:15:01.498 --> 02:15:02.379]  Do you have the clip?
[02:15:04.742 --> 02:15:05.062]  Here it is.
[02:15:06.001 --> 02:15:17.968]  One of the things you've been talking about on your show is your allegation that government officials are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking, and the grooming of children.
[02:15:17.988 --> 02:15:18.088]  Right?
[02:15:18.108 --> 02:15:18.669]  What do you mean?
[02:15:18.529 --> 02:15:21.529]  You mean like what Jeffrey Epstein did with the Clintons?
[02:15:21.529 --> 02:15:24.529]  [crowd cheers]
[02:15:24.529 --> 02:15:27.529]  [crowd cheers]
[02:15:27.594 --> 02:15:30.676]  Bigger than your whole show truck.
[02:15:32.672 --> 02:15:33.512]  Bye bye.
[02:15:33.512 --> 02:15:34.912]  Oh, he's got that hand!
[02:15:34.912 --> 02:15:36.172]  It's ridiculous!
[02:15:36.172 --> 02:15:37.011]  Oh my God!
[02:15:37.011 --> 02:15:44.431]   It's your allegation that government officials are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking,
[02:15:44.431 --> 02:15:46.271]  and the grooming of children, right?
[02:15:46.271 --> 02:15:50.511]   What do you mean, like, what Jeffrey Epstein did with Clinton?
[02:15:50.511 --> 02:15:53.092]  (upbeat music)
[02:15:53.092 --> 02:15:58.511]  They're failing.
[02:15:58.511 --> 02:15:59.551]  They're falling.
[02:15:59.994 --> 02:16:01.175]  They don't know what to do.
[02:16:01.475 --> 02:16:03.617]  They spent years rigging these court cases.
[02:16:04.477 --> 02:16:17.426]  They spent tens of thousands, conservatively, of articles, thousands of TV shows, trying to obtain a jury, rigged jury questions, all of it, all to try to think some made-up verdict of $40-something million.
[02:16:17.446 --> 02:16:18.547]  We don't have $2 million.
[02:16:18.567 --> 02:16:20.008]  Who's going to beat us?
[02:16:20.789 --> 02:16:21.729]  It's a joke.
[02:16:24.551 --> 02:16:25.252]  We're winning.
[02:16:26.650 --> 02:16:27.491]  They're losing.
[02:16:27.611 --> 02:16:29.352]  They're the little men behind the curtain.
[02:16:30.794 --> 02:16:34.577]  Gerald Cilente, the Trends Forecast, one of my good friends, is always loaded for bear.
[02:16:36.138 --> 02:16:40.582]  He's about to take over, and then in one hour, Owen Schroyer and the War Room.
[02:16:40.642 --> 02:16:43.364]  Remember when you asked, why didn't people battle tyranny?
[02:16:43.824 --> 02:16:44.885]  Why didn't people stand up?
[02:16:45.025 --> 02:16:45.666]  We are.
[02:16:45.846 --> 02:16:46.367]  You are.
[02:16:46.867 --> 02:16:49.629]  By listening and viewing, I cannot thank you enough.
[02:16:49.729 --> 02:16:53.112]  Your power of word of mouth is what the enemies of freedom fear.
[02:16:54.033 --> 02:16:55.795]  So share the word about Gerald Cilente.
[02:16:55.855 --> 02:16:57.336]  Tweet Gerald Cilente's live right now.
[02:16:57.456 --> 02:17:02.515]   Send them to the band.video link or the info wars.com/showlink and get your final chance

[02:17:06.235 --> 02:17:15.236]  [Music]

[02:17:59.087 --> 02:17:59.948]  It keeps us on the air.
[02:18:00.814 --> 02:18:01.895]  And it's going to sell out quick.
[02:18:02.395 --> 02:18:14.727]  But despite that, we're offering it for 50% off at infowarestore.com to support our longtime viewers and listeners and for new folks to take advantage of it.
[02:18:15.107 --> 02:18:17.629]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:18:18.190 --> 02:18:19.091]  Thank you so much.
[02:18:19.151 --> 02:18:22.334]  And thank everyone and the staff for all that you do.
[02:18:23.699 --> 02:18:26.001]  And we're in critical times right now.
[02:18:26.281 --> 02:18:27.782]  The markets are going way down.
[02:18:27.802 --> 02:18:29.023]  We'll talk about that in a bit.
[02:18:29.524 --> 02:18:32.486]  But Alex had mentioned Bill Clinton.
[02:18:33.246 --> 02:18:34.347]  This is a t-shirt.
[02:18:34.367 --> 02:18:35.468]  I don't know if you can see that.
[02:18:35.488 --> 02:18:40.772]  This is a t-shirt that I did back when he was running.
[02:18:40.792 --> 02:18:43.114]  He wears Slick Willy.
[02:18:44.255 --> 02:18:44.455]  Yep.
[02:18:45.335 --> 02:18:45.856]  Here he is.
[02:18:48.017 --> 02:18:48.638]  Slick Willy.
[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:52.601]  Here is another one we did.
[02:18:54.278 --> 02:18:57.459]  This is when he became president.
[02:18:58.999 --> 02:18:59.419]  That's it.
[02:18:59.439 --> 02:19:07.021]  A mobster, gangster, murderous little low-life piece of scum, garbage crap.
[02:19:09.442 --> 02:19:09.622]  Yep.
[02:19:11.562 --> 02:19:12.503]  One after another.
[02:19:14.163 --> 02:19:17.744]  One after another, these low-lives are ruining our lives.
[02:19:21.081 --> 02:19:25.123]  It's a crime syndicate that morons and imbeciles call a government.
[02:19:27.305 --> 02:19:36.730]  This is the scum boy that gave us NAFTA that sent our jobs to Mexico for cheap labor.
[02:19:39.311 --> 02:19:46.696]  This is the scum boy that allowed the drug dealers to run their ads on TV.
[02:19:47.757 --> 02:19:49.478]  Oh, a big pharma, I forgot.
[02:19:49.778 --> 02:19:51.799]  Oh, hey, I gotta be proper, big pharma.
[02:19:52.039 --> 02:19:53.099]  And that's the other thing.
[02:19:53.999 --> 02:20:02.602]  Oh, you know, Mr. Sollenti, we'd like you a lot more if you'd lower your voice and stop using those curse words and vulgar words.
[02:20:03.343 --> 02:20:05.844]  Get this in your head, little boys and girls.
[02:20:06.744 --> 02:20:14.867]  When you're in a fight, you don't say, oh, please put that knife or gun away.
[02:20:16.340 --> 02:20:17.921]  Or that stick that you're holding?
[02:20:18.061 --> 02:20:19.442]  And don't hit me!
[02:20:21.043 --> 02:20:21.804]  You fight.
[02:20:23.045 --> 02:20:25.326]  And we're in the fight for our lives.
[02:20:26.807 --> 02:20:29.810]  Let me tell you what vulgarity is.
[02:20:31.010 --> 02:20:53.543]   Vulgarity is the crap that these little boys and girls, prostitutes, media whores, little Jakey Tapper, Donnie Lemon, One little clown after another with arrogant attitudes, and they write articles and spew out the crap.
[02:20:55.423 --> 02:21:04.126]  The United States is sending 785 million dollars in military aid to Ukraine.
[02:21:07.487 --> 02:21:08.907]  That is vulgarity.
[02:21:10.307 --> 02:21:11.848]  Military aid?
[02:21:12.930 --> 02:21:15.991]  Why, you little boys and girls!
[02:21:17.471 --> 02:21:19.251]  That is vulgarity!
[02:21:22.992 --> 02:21:24.272]  It isn't aid.
[02:21:25.552 --> 02:21:28.073]  It is murder, morons!
[02:21:31.054 --> 02:21:36.815]  Murderous weapons to keep killing people and to keep bloodying the killing fields.
[02:21:37.795 --> 02:21:38.315]  Jerks!
[02:21:41.374 --> 02:21:42.935]  Oh, calm down, Selenti.
[02:21:43.015 --> 02:21:48.779]  If you would only say it the way they say it, we would swallow their garbage.
[02:21:49.320 --> 02:21:52.642]  And we hate you because you won't swallow it.
[02:21:53.463 --> 02:21:55.964]  Same reason I don't like Alex Jones.
[02:21:56.345 --> 02:22:01.268]  Why, how dare you not swallow the crap that I love to swallow?
[02:22:03.049 --> 02:22:04.831]  Get this in your head, everybody.
[02:22:05.511 --> 02:22:06.592]  I'm an American.
[02:22:09.294 --> 02:22:10.615]  Proud to be an American.
[02:22:13.612 --> 02:22:13.812]  Yep.
[02:22:16.834 --> 02:22:18.595]  I live by the founding fathers.
[02:22:18.695 --> 02:22:20.216]  No foreign entanglements.
[02:22:20.336 --> 02:22:34.564]  I've read to you, time in and time out, all of those little reports that we have here from George Washington, telling the American people not to get involved in foreign entanglements.
[02:22:35.364 --> 02:22:36.765]  It's none of our business.
[02:22:41.567 --> 02:22:46.315]   Word after word, If you love a nation and hate a nation, you become a slave to them.
[02:22:48.197 --> 02:22:49.238]  Military aid?
[02:22:49.738 --> 02:22:57.044]  What does Russia and Ukraine have to do with my... You know, saving me as an American has nothing to do with me.
[02:22:57.064 --> 02:23:00.306]  This is against everything going on.
[02:23:00.647 --> 02:23:01.707]  So here's the deal.
[02:23:02.788 --> 02:23:05.610]  And here's your cover of this week's Trends Journal.
[02:23:05.651 --> 02:23:06.891]  It's going out tomorrow.
[02:23:09.053 --> 02:23:09.794]  Support war?
[02:23:13.462 --> 02:23:14.302]  Support Satan.
[02:23:17.104 --> 02:23:18.564]  That's to cover your magazine.
[02:23:21.966 --> 02:23:27.088]  If you support war, you support Satan.
[02:23:29.329 --> 02:23:38.693]  The God that you believe in, there we go, support war, support Satan.
[02:23:43.487 --> 02:23:45.728]  What God supports war?
[02:23:46.948 --> 02:23:48.948]  Oh, this is satanic.
[02:23:48.948 --> 02:23:55.188]  God doesn't support war.
[02:23:55.993 --> 02:23:57.074]  Only Satan does.
[02:23:59.895 --> 02:24:01.236]  And that's who's running the show.
[02:24:03.377 --> 02:24:04.777]  We have satanic people.
[02:24:04.797 --> 02:24:10.460]  How many times was Clinton on that plane with that pedophile guy?
[02:24:11.852 --> 02:24:12.953]  Oh, did he hung himself?
[02:24:13.513 --> 02:24:13.954]  Epstein.
[02:24:14.034 --> 02:24:14.974]  Oh, yeah, sure he did.
[02:24:14.994 --> 02:24:15.935]  Yeah.
[02:24:19.378 --> 02:24:20.819]  And Mary had a little lamb.
[02:24:21.319 --> 02:24:21.599]  Yeah.
[02:24:25.462 --> 02:24:26.603]  She was white as snow.
[02:24:26.683 --> 02:24:29.545]  And everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.
[02:24:32.387 --> 02:24:39.272]  Why do you think they pay a Clinton, as I was saying before, three or four hundred thousand dollars to give a one hour talk?
[02:24:40.233 --> 02:24:41.174]  He killed NAFTA.
[02:24:42.481 --> 02:24:44.963]  Let the drug dealers put their ads on TV.
[02:24:45.964 --> 02:24:49.767]  Get away with the Glass-Steagall Act so the banks to gangsters could become bigger.
[02:24:51.088 --> 02:24:52.750]  You like the Yugoslav War?
[02:24:53.830 --> 02:25:00.076]  Now I know you like the 500,000 children he killed in Iraq by putting sanctions on them.
[02:25:00.116 --> 02:25:04.499]  Every time he got down, quote, with his pants down, his bombs away over Baghdad.
[02:25:09.403 --> 02:25:13.935]   Bill Clinton What do you think they pay him this kind of money for?
[02:25:15.297 --> 02:25:16.297]  You're giving him B.S.
[02:25:16.337 --> 02:25:19.139]  for free all day long, that arrogant little boy!
[02:25:23.042 --> 02:25:25.024]  We are in the fight for our lives.
[02:25:26.445 --> 02:25:28.967]  And they're gonna do everything they can to silence us.
[02:25:30.368 --> 02:25:33.130]  They did that hit piece on Dr. Joseph Mercola.
[02:25:33.790 --> 02:25:36.613]  In the toilet paper record, the New York Times.
[02:25:37.173 --> 02:25:37.433]  Pfft!
[02:25:38.114 --> 02:25:39.515]  Boy, Mercola answered them.
[02:25:41.365 --> 02:25:42.805]  Can't come close to that, man.
[02:25:43.986 --> 02:25:48.647]  He didn't believe in the Operation Warp Speed gene therapy, Vax.
[02:25:49.127 --> 02:25:58.709]  And he has the videos up there of Biden and Fauci and one after another saying how if you got the Vax, you'd be okay.
[02:25:58.729 --> 02:26:02.750]  It wouldn't hurt you.
[02:26:02.770 --> 02:26:06.411]  It'd help you.
[02:26:06.431 --> 02:26:10.692]  You know any people I know that got vaccinated that got the virus?
[02:26:12.305 --> 02:26:15.627]  Oh, including that clown Jimmy Kimmel that they were talking about.
[02:26:15.847 --> 02:26:17.788]  Yeah, that arrogant little comedian.
[02:26:18.328 --> 02:26:21.650]  All these little comedians telling you to take a vaccination.
[02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:27.893]  All these actors, comics, murderers.
[02:26:29.404 --> 02:26:33.946]  And boy do they get angry at you when you won't swallow their crap!
[02:26:34.346 --> 02:26:37.767]  How dare you not swallow my crap!
[02:26:38.347 --> 02:26:39.967]  I'm not an American!
[02:26:39.987 --> 02:26:43.369]  I bow down to dictators!
[02:26:43.769 --> 02:26:45.729]  And little boys and girls!
[02:26:47.250 --> 02:26:48.790]  I like Gavin Newsom!
[02:26:49.090 --> 02:26:50.531]  I like Andy Cuomo!
[02:26:50.771 --> 02:26:52.371]  Give me Whitmer's Whitmer!
[02:26:52.551 --> 02:26:53.992]  How about the wine?
[02:26:58.729 --> 02:27:01.470]  You mayors, you governors, sellouts!
[02:27:02.851 --> 02:27:04.231]  You're not Americans!
[02:27:07.232 --> 02:27:10.494]  The Founding Fathers would be disgusted with you.
[02:27:11.114 --> 02:27:14.415]  Matter of fact, you'd bow down to the Brits!
[02:27:17.356 --> 02:27:20.638]  And even suck up to a guy like Boris Johnson.
[02:27:20.658 --> 02:27:23.559]  Hey, where's that clown these days?
[02:27:26.417 --> 02:27:27.338]  It's a freak show.
[02:27:27.958 --> 02:27:28.859]  It's a freak show.
[02:27:30.020 --> 02:27:31.621]  And you got to do something to stop it.
[02:27:32.902 --> 02:27:35.404]  So support InfoWars, do everything you can.
[02:27:36.806 --> 02:27:38.807]  We are in the times of our lives.
[02:27:39.948 --> 02:27:43.591]  We come back, we're going to talk about the economy, where it's going and what's next.
[02:27:44.011 --> 02:27:45.733]  We're into rough, rough time.
[02:27:45.953 --> 02:27:46.493]  Stay tuned.
[02:27:47.614 --> 02:27:49.616]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:50.096 --> 02:27:53.039]  And as I said, do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[02:27:54.082 --> 02:27:57.383]  Because they're going to do everything they can to silence the truth.
[02:27:58.964 --> 02:28:00.285]  Misinformation.
[02:28:00.505 --> 02:28:09.808]  Anything that the dictators say that you don't believe in is called misinformation in the new draconian world of America.
[02:28:10.269 --> 02:28:11.129]  Democracy?
[02:28:12.729 --> 02:28:14.230]  Yeah.
[02:28:15.150 --> 02:28:16.131]  That's a joke.
[02:28:16.191 --> 02:28:17.691]  It's no democracy anymore.
[02:28:17.731 --> 02:28:18.492]  We've lost it.
[02:28:19.652 --> 02:28:25.920]   And again, this shows you how The media sells what they're selling and doesn't put out the truth.
[02:28:26.460 --> 02:28:28.961]  And that's what we do, by the way, with the Trends Journal magazine.
[02:28:29.001 --> 02:28:32.503]  We write the identical story of how it was reported.
[02:28:33.403 --> 02:28:37.965]  And then we give you our analysis, our trend post and trend forecast, where it's going.
[02:28:38.466 --> 02:28:42.828]  We don't skew the story like a headline like this moronics thing.
[02:28:43.768 --> 02:28:47.670]  Right wing fury at IRS overhaul.
[02:28:50.259 --> 02:29:06.943]  It has been called President Biden's shadow army, described as a strike force to shake down small businesses with assault rifles and likened to a military militia of auditors on search and destroy missions.
[02:29:09.404 --> 02:29:18.446]  A decade long Republican antipathy towards the Internal Revenue Service has reached a new level of enmity.
[02:29:19.338 --> 02:29:31.452]  With the passage of the Democratic-backed bill that gives the agency $80 billion to beef up its ability to go after tax cheats.
[02:29:34.556 --> 02:29:36.458]  How's that for propaganda?
[02:29:36.878 --> 02:29:38.780]  Who are the big tax cheats?
[02:29:43.706 --> 02:30:00.370]  How about that bill you clowns just passed that give the hedge funds and private equity groups all those breaks so those billionaires and quadruple millionaires don't pay what we the little people of Slavelandia pay?
[02:30:02.530 --> 02:30:04.090]  That's who they're gonna come after?
[02:30:04.110 --> 02:30:10.032]  Oh, you don't think Bezos has enough dough to beat the IRS?
[02:30:11.272 --> 02:30:12.092]  Or Buffett?
[02:30:13.954 --> 02:30:14.634]  Or Musk?
[02:30:15.874 --> 02:30:16.595]  Or Gates?
[02:30:21.156 --> 02:30:23.556]  Arming, arming the IRS.
[02:30:28.297 --> 02:30:33.658]  They should put some other letters after it too, with an F and a, yeah, and a Y-O-U.
[02:30:37.699 --> 02:30:41.440]  Why do we even have an IRS and why are we even paying federal income tax?
[02:30:43.991 --> 02:30:45.411]  A man made this up.
[02:30:45.591 --> 02:30:47.072]  Another murderous freak.
[02:30:47.112 --> 02:30:49.752]  Remember, Harvard, Princeton, Yale.
[02:30:50.352 --> 02:30:52.073]  Bullets, bombs, and banks.
[02:30:52.793 --> 02:30:54.913]  By their deeds you shall know them.
[02:30:57.294 --> 02:31:00.434]  And the Princeton murderer, Woodrow Wilson.
[02:31:01.035 --> 02:31:04.615]  The arrogant boy that gave us the government teaching system.
[02:31:04.734 --> 02:31:07.854]  that imbeciles call a public school system.
[02:31:07.854 --> 02:31:19.534]   Woodrow Wilson, that gave us federal income tax,
[02:31:19.534 --> 02:31:22.654]  did not exist before that.
[02:31:22.654 --> 02:31:24.654]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:31:24.664 --> 02:31:42.102]   Woodrow Wilson, the arrogant clown of a boy, all of you Princeton people, who gave us World War I, Oh, the war to end all wars.
[02:31:42.582 --> 02:31:44.283]  You like to swallow crap?
[02:31:45.623 --> 02:31:46.823]  How many wars since?
[02:31:49.324 --> 02:31:50.585]  Oh, when did it end?
[02:31:50.665 --> 02:31:51.165]  In 1918?
[02:31:51.305 --> 02:31:53.166]  Oh, 20 years later?
[02:31:53.186 --> 02:31:53.166]  38?
[02:31:53.246 --> 02:31:57.107]  World War II's going on?
[02:31:57.447 --> 02:31:58.247]  Starts to happen?
[02:31:59.508 --> 02:32:06.570]  Oh, and I forgot about the Vietnam War, or the Korean War before that, but then there was the Yemen War, the Afghan Wars, the two Iraq Wars, and Somalia.
[02:32:06.610 --> 02:32:07.491]  What's going on in Mosul?
[02:32:07.791 --> 02:32:07.931]  Yeah.
[02:32:10.521 --> 02:32:11.061]  Murderers.
[02:32:14.283 --> 02:32:14.924]  IRS?
[02:32:16.264 --> 02:32:17.685]  There should be no IRS.
[02:32:18.866 --> 02:32:23.829]  If I was elected president, I would do away with the federal income tax.
[02:32:26.871 --> 02:32:27.131]  Yep.
[02:32:28.952 --> 02:32:32.674]  I do away with the federal income tax and I do away with the public school system.
[02:32:33.775 --> 02:32:34.535]  And I'll tell you why.
[02:32:37.277 --> 02:32:58.039]   In New York, The number here, just had it a bit ago, it cost some over $20,000 a year to send a kid to the brainwashing system.
[02:33:00.560 --> 02:33:03.002]  So you go, you multiply that times 12.
[02:33:05.580 --> 02:33:09.122]  And it comes out to the numbers of $247,000 to send a kid from kindergarten to the 12th grade.
[02:33:09.143 --> 02:33:09.122]  $247,000!
[02:33:09.183 --> 02:33:12.085]  To get a job at Walmart.
[02:33:12.145 --> 02:33:13.506]  No, to drive an Amazon truck.
[02:33:13.526 --> 02:33:18.289]  I'd rather work in the warehouse.
[02:33:18.108 --> 02:33:27.508]  $247,000 to get a job at Walmart.
[02:33:27.508 --> 02:33:29.707]  No, drive an Amazon truck.
[02:33:29.707 --> 02:33:32.867]  I'd rather work in the warehouse.
[02:33:32.867 --> 02:33:37.188]  How about working at Staples?
[02:33:37.229 --> 02:33:39.851]  No, I think I'd rather be at Home Depot.
[02:33:40.892 --> 02:33:42.994]  No, Kohl's would be good for me.
[02:33:44.815 --> 02:33:45.836]  How about Target?
[02:33:50.360 --> 02:33:52.602]  Send them to the fifth grade and end it.
[02:33:52.682 --> 02:33:55.505]  Then you can go out and do whatever you want until you go get a job.
[02:33:55.965 --> 02:33:56.946]  This is a waste of money.
[02:33:57.827 --> 02:33:59.929]  It's a waste of money right in front of our eyes.
[02:34:01.290 --> 02:34:02.551]  An education system.
[02:34:05.182 --> 02:34:05.762]  To do that?
[02:34:05.782 --> 02:34:12.146]  This is criminality.
[02:34:14.108 --> 02:34:18.691]  Nothing is going to change if we don't have a new third party.
[02:34:19.791 --> 02:34:21.492]  Save your baloney, shove it.
[02:34:23.974 --> 02:34:30.938]  Any repulsive kin or demo crap that gets in there, they're a member of the team.
[02:34:31.639 --> 02:34:33.640]  Remember, it's one big club and you ain't in it.
[02:34:34.597 --> 02:34:35.858]  As George Carlin said.
[02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:43.943]  And remember, he who is not angry when there is just cause to anger is immoral.
[02:34:44.803 --> 02:34:45.044]  Why?
[02:34:45.104 --> 02:34:47.425]  Because anger looks to the good of justice.
[02:34:48.466 --> 02:34:59.212]  And if you can live amid injustice without anger, you are immoral as well as unjust, said St.
[02:34:59.392 --> 02:35:00.253]  Thomas Aquinas.
[02:35:01.934 --> 02:35:03.455]  So going back to where we are.
[02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:07.201]  This is serious, serious stuff.
[02:35:08.641 --> 02:35:10.622]  And we are in this fight together.
[02:35:11.942 --> 02:35:14.323]  And it's a fight for freedom and a peaceful fight.
[02:35:18.104 --> 02:35:20.245]  Do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:35:23.166 --> 02:35:33.549]  And if you need to know what's going on, and you need to know what to do, you really need to trans-journal.
[02:35:34.511 --> 02:35:36.432]  We're giving you history before it happens.
[02:35:36.512 --> 02:35:39.093]  We're talking about, and I come back, I'm going to talk about the markets.
[02:35:40.974 --> 02:35:42.315]  Our subscribers knew this.
[02:35:42.435 --> 02:35:48.378]  Oh, by the way, the violence that's going on all over the streets said it would happen when the COVID war happened.
[02:35:48.878 --> 02:35:50.359]  And people lost everything.
[02:35:50.879 --> 02:35:53.741]  And when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[02:35:54.261 --> 02:35:55.722]  And they're losing it globally.
[02:35:56.642 --> 02:35:58.843]  We are on, World War III has begun.
[02:35:58.863 --> 02:36:02.365]  And if we don't stop it, it's going to be hell on earth.
[02:36:03.644 --> 02:36:06.666]  So if we don't unite for peace, we're going to die in war.
[02:36:08.168 --> 02:36:10.850]  So again, do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[02:36:12.951 --> 02:36:15.293]  And when we come back, we're going to talk about the economy.
[02:36:16.134 --> 02:36:17.655]  Hey, hello everybody.
[02:36:17.875 --> 02:36:19.797]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:36:19.817 --> 02:36:25.041]  And as I keep saying, do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[02:36:25.081 --> 02:36:26.382]  They have great products there.
[02:36:26.402 --> 02:36:27.323]  I use them.
[02:36:27.403 --> 02:36:27.903]  I like them.
[02:36:28.964 --> 02:36:32.567]  And you're not only supporting InfoWars, you're really supporting yourself.
[02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:39.164]  Because these are great, great products and they help keep the truth alive and keep you alive.
[02:36:40.665 --> 02:36:44.907]  58% of Americans worry student loan forgiveness will make inflation worse.
[02:36:44.947 --> 02:36:46.749]  This is CNBC News Survey.
[02:36:47.829 --> 02:36:49.150]  Why do you got to give these?
[02:36:49.170 --> 02:36:51.252]  What's this student loan forgiveness stuff?
[02:36:51.272 --> 02:36:52.172]  Who made this stuff up?
[02:36:52.192 --> 02:36:53.893]  It was your decision to go do this.
[02:36:53.913 --> 02:36:55.294]  Why do I got to pay for your mistake?
[02:36:57.616 --> 02:37:00.738]  You paid this money to get brainwashed in a university.
[02:37:02.569 --> 02:37:03.549]  I gotta pay for this.
[02:37:05.069 --> 02:37:15.851]  Again, as I said, in New York State, it costs $247,000 to educate an imbecile from kindergarten to the 12th grade.
[02:37:17.412 --> 02:37:19.492]  To get a lousy job making nothing.
[02:37:21.052 --> 02:37:21.292]  Yeah.
[02:37:23.773 --> 02:37:42.125]   The percentage of Americans who evaluate their lives poorly enough to be considered suffering On Gallup's Life Evaluation Index was 5.6% in July, the highest since the index inception since 2008.
[02:37:42.405 --> 02:37:44.265]  This just came out.
[02:37:44.285 --> 02:37:47.166]  Isn't that great?
[02:37:49.027 --> 02:37:53.788]  Student debt, miserable as can be, the percentage of U.S.
[02:37:53.868 --> 02:38:05.408]   adults estimated to be thriving has steadily declined We're a record high of 59.2%.
[02:38:05.449 --> 02:38:08.591]  The latest estimate, 51.2%.
[02:38:09.272 --> 02:38:10.513]  Yep.
[02:38:14.616 --> 02:38:17.558]  Suffering rates have notably climbed in recent months.
[02:38:18.559 --> 02:38:21.001]  The Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike.
[02:38:21.061 --> 02:38:22.182]  What Democrats, Republicans?
[02:38:22.482 --> 02:38:29.698]   How can you be so stupid to align yourself with a party Party with a crime syndicate.
[02:38:30.158 --> 02:38:31.259]  I like the Bloods.
[02:38:31.419 --> 02:38:32.540]  I like the Crips.
[02:38:33.361 --> 02:38:34.722]  Give me the Mafia.
[02:38:38.405 --> 02:38:41.927]  That's the third party.
[02:38:41.987 --> 02:38:52.375]  Since June 2021, the highest point for Life Education Index among Americans, the portion who are suffering has doubled among Republicans and among Democrats.
[02:38:53.136 --> 02:38:53.276]  Yep.
[02:38:56.834 --> 02:39:00.575]  In addition to general life ratings, Gallup tracks, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:39:01.535 --> 02:39:01.996]  Let's see.
[02:39:02.056 --> 02:39:05.477]  Americans report experiencing stress has edged up to 48%.
[02:39:05.577 --> 02:39:06.097]  From 43% in July, 2021.
[02:39:06.137 --> 02:39:06.517]  Daily worry at 42%.
[02:39:06.557 --> 02:39:10.298]  Elevated in comparison to the 38% one year ago.
[02:39:10.117 --> 02:39:20.597]   in July 2021. Daily worry at 42 percent, elevated in comparison to the 38 percent one year ago.
[02:39:20.597 --> 02:39:28.996]   Isn't that great? The spike scallop measured in March 2020 were about four times greater
[02:39:28.996 --> 02:39:34.996]  than increases seen in 2008 as a result of the Great Recession.
[02:39:35.213 --> 02:39:36.494]  You see how low we're going here?
[02:39:38.675 --> 02:39:42.216]  All we are are plantation workers of slavelandia.
[02:39:43.576 --> 02:39:44.977]  The rich own everything.
[02:39:46.077 --> 02:40:00.974]   This scam with 80 billion dollars To the IRS, a federal, we should not have federal taxes, they're criminalities created by one of America's number one criminals, Woodrow Wilson.
[02:40:02.995 --> 02:40:03.255]  Again.
[02:40:05.302 --> 02:40:10.766]  It gave us the government education system that imbeciles and morons call a public education system.
[02:40:11.106 --> 02:40:13.668]  You want to have a kid, it's up to you to educate them.
[02:40:13.988 --> 02:40:19.913]  You got all the stuff you need out there, and with the online world you can do everything you need.
[02:40:20.793 --> 02:40:21.814]  I don't want to pay for this.
[02:40:24.616 --> 02:40:26.878]  I'll pay for the poor people that can't afford it.
[02:40:28.839 --> 02:40:29.700]  But not the others.
[02:40:32.569 --> 02:40:40.631]  Woodrow Wilson, the guy that gave us World War I. Woodrow Wilson, the guy that gave us the federal income tax.
[02:40:41.831 --> 02:40:42.711]  Oh, I forgot!
[02:40:43.271 --> 02:40:43.891]  I forgot!
[02:40:43.951 --> 02:40:45.031]  How could I forget this?
[02:40:45.631 --> 02:40:56.173]  He also gave us the bankster gangsters that they call the Federal Reserve System, that is as federal as Federal Express.
[02:40:58.194 --> 02:40:59.314]  Woodrow Wilson!
[02:41:04.284 --> 02:41:06.426]  The Bankster Bandits, he gave us.
[02:41:08.087 --> 02:41:10.489]  World War I, he gave us.
[02:41:15.473 --> 02:41:16.514]  Income tax.
[02:41:17.334 --> 02:41:19.456]  Federal income tax, he gave us.
[02:41:23.699 --> 02:41:26.542]  Banksters, one after another.
[02:41:29.064 --> 02:41:29.544]  War.
[02:41:31.125 --> 02:41:31.766]  Income tax.
[02:41:33.269 --> 02:41:35.269]  Federal Reserve.
[02:41:35.269 --> 02:41:43.769]  This is terrible.
[02:41:44.313 --> 02:41:48.074]  So if one man could do it, we the people can reverse it.
[02:41:48.493 --> 02:41:52.973]   It does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority,
[02:41:52.973 --> 02:41:56.813]  keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men.
[02:41:56.813 --> 02:42:04.813]  So we could change this around.
[02:42:05.004 --> 02:42:08.484]  And one of the ways you do it is by supporting InfoWars and tuning into this.
[02:42:09.004 --> 02:42:11.065]  And again, the Trends Journal magazine.
[02:42:11.785 --> 02:42:14.425]  I was looking through some past issues.
[02:42:14.465 --> 02:42:16.646]  This one used to be a quarterly.
[02:42:17.386 --> 02:42:20.307]  And in the back, you see these pictures?
[02:42:22.147 --> 02:42:24.807]  Yep, the Nobel Piece of Crap Prize winner.
[02:42:25.788 --> 02:42:26.088]  This is from 2013.
[02:42:28.476 --> 02:42:29.776]  I even have these magazines.
[02:42:29.857 --> 02:42:34.358]  I went out to buy them when it happened back in 2008, because I knew what a fraud Obama was.
[02:42:36.079 --> 02:42:37.039]  Rolling Stone.
[02:42:38.780 --> 02:42:39.800]  Barack Obama.
[02:42:40.420 --> 02:42:41.080]  A New Hope.
[02:42:44.462 --> 02:42:45.502]  Time Magazine.
[02:42:46.801 --> 02:42:48.801]  Great Expectations.
[02:42:48.801 --> 02:42:54.801]  People Magazine.
[02:42:55.612 --> 02:42:56.393]  Okay!
[02:42:57.333 --> 02:42:58.374]  Obama!
[02:42:58.854 --> 02:43:01.156]  The celebration of the century.
[02:43:02.957 --> 02:43:03.997]  And the New Yorker.
[02:43:05.278 --> 02:43:06.539]  That's the one over here.
[02:43:11.482 --> 02:43:14.024]  Putting him on George Washington's face.
[02:43:16.525 --> 02:43:18.206]  Barack Obama.
[02:43:19.407 --> 02:43:22.189]  The Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner.
[02:43:24.699 --> 02:43:24.919]  Yep.
[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:25.700]  Folks.
[02:43:25.981 --> 02:43:26.281]  Folks.
[02:43:26.321 --> 02:43:27.362]  He was always folking us.
[02:43:27.542 --> 02:43:27.903]  Folks.
[02:43:28.023 --> 02:43:28.383]  Folks.
[02:43:29.625 --> 02:43:31.507]  I want that guy Gaddafi out of there.
[02:43:32.648 --> 02:43:34.470]  I want that guy Assad out of there.
[02:43:35.631 --> 02:43:35.872]  Yep.
[02:43:37.233 --> 02:43:37.734]  There he is.
[02:43:37.794 --> 02:43:38.174]  Look at this.
[02:43:38.575 --> 02:43:38.935]  Look at this.
[02:43:39.476 --> 02:43:42.879]  This is the garbage that clowns swallow.
[02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:43.780]  You got it?
[02:43:44.441 --> 02:43:44.942]  You got it?
[02:43:46.175 --> 02:43:56.560]  This is the garbage that clowns swallow, and when you won't swallow the garbage that they love to swallow, they hate you.
[02:43:57.180 --> 02:44:00.122]  How dare you not swallow the crap that I've swallowed?
[02:44:00.622 --> 02:44:04.864]  Oh, and I think Obama was a couple of shades darker than me.
[02:44:07.645 --> 02:44:09.866]  So don't call this a racist country.
[02:44:12.107 --> 02:44:13.788]  They elected a black president.
[02:44:15.211 --> 02:44:17.633]  And a black first lady got in there.
[02:44:20.635 --> 02:44:22.196]  Are there racists in the country?
[02:44:22.216 --> 02:44:23.156]  Of course there are.
[02:44:23.957 --> 02:44:25.558]  Are there murderers and thieves?
[02:44:25.958 --> 02:44:26.879]  Of course there are.
[02:44:26.979 --> 02:44:28.660]  All you have to do is look at Congress.
[02:44:29.641 --> 02:44:30.321]  Satanic!
[02:44:30.741 --> 02:44:31.602]  They love war.
[02:44:32.122 --> 02:44:33.963]  Only people that love Satan love war.
[02:44:36.645 --> 02:44:38.626]  Racist, sexist, oh!
[02:44:39.587 --> 02:44:42.109]  How about, uh, pedophiles?
[02:44:44.528 --> 02:44:45.908]  Yeah, so there's good and bad in everyone.
[02:44:45.928 --> 02:44:47.349]  This is not a racist nation.
[02:44:47.629 --> 02:44:50.130]  A racist nation does not elect a black president.
[02:44:50.630 --> 02:44:53.991]  But how people swallowed Obama.
[02:44:54.271 --> 02:44:55.852]  Hope and change you could believe in.
[02:44:56.612 --> 02:44:58.572]  Yep, gave us the Afghan troop surge.
[02:44:59.213 --> 02:45:00.873]  I want that guy Assad out of there.
[02:45:01.453 --> 02:45:02.614]  Syrian debacle.
[02:45:03.114 --> 02:45:04.434]  Oh, he killed about 650,000.
[02:45:04.614 --> 02:45:07.035]  Oh, about 7 million refugees.
[02:45:07.535 --> 02:45:09.476]  Oh, and stealing the oil from the East Coast.
[02:45:12.237 --> 02:45:13.497]  We gotta change the system.
[02:45:15.163 --> 02:45:18.665]  And InfoWars is helping you do it, and so are we, the Trends Journal.
[02:45:19.845 --> 02:45:20.906]  We need a new way.
[02:45:21.706 --> 02:45:25.008]  And the markets, they just took a look, they were down 620 points.
[02:45:25.428 --> 02:45:26.108]  Where are they going?
[02:45:26.168 --> 02:45:26.749]  What's next?
[02:45:26.809 --> 02:45:27.949]  Where's the economy going?
[02:45:28.509 --> 02:45:30.090]  We're going to talk about it when we get back.
[02:45:30.170 --> 02:45:34.692]  In the meantime, go to InfoWarsStores.com and do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:45:35.653 --> 02:45:37.594]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:45:37.674 --> 02:45:40.015]  Yep, and that cover of the Trends Journal says it all.
[02:45:40.895 --> 02:45:44.097]  Swallow our BS and follow our orders.
[02:45:45.157 --> 02:45:46.918]  And that's the new American way.
[02:45:47.858 --> 02:45:56.961]  I could yet be so stupid to listen to a Jimmy Kimmel, a clown like Colbert, one little jerk after another.
[02:45:56.981 --> 02:45:58.841]  Oh, oh, whoa, whoa.
[02:45:59.361 --> 02:46:00.542]  Take that vaccination.
[02:46:00.762 --> 02:46:00.962]  Yep.
[02:46:01.482 --> 02:46:10.485]  Anyway, you got to support InfoWars to support the truth and they're going to do everything they can to take it away from us again.
[02:46:11.326 --> 02:46:13.047]  As the cover of the Trends Journal shows.
[02:46:13.107 --> 02:46:17.970]  And one of the great products they have out there is their DNA Force Plus.
[02:46:18.971 --> 02:46:22.493]  And it's back now and you get 50% off on it.
[02:46:23.334 --> 02:46:36.162]  And the DNA Force Plus, it's the formula that helps you support optimal energy levels while adapting your body to handle the daily bombardment of toxins.
[02:46:36.823 --> 02:46:39.965]  And boy, are they bombarding us with toxins.
[02:46:40.925 --> 02:46:42.968]  You like those pesticides, dog?
[02:46:43.008 --> 02:46:44.569]  Give me the insecticides.
[02:46:44.890 --> 02:46:46.512]  I like GMOs.
[02:46:47.233 --> 02:46:48.074]  No, no, no.
[02:46:48.114 --> 02:46:49.916]  Put more of that iron in the water.
[02:46:49.956 --> 02:46:51.498]  That's really great for you.
[02:46:51.518 --> 02:46:54.181]  Oh, how about those chemicals?
[02:46:54.261 --> 02:46:55.523]  You mean the forever ones?
[02:46:56.203 --> 02:46:56.384]  Yep.
[02:46:57.223 --> 02:46:58.464]  Artificial flavors?
[02:46:58.624 --> 02:47:00.306]  I like artificial flowers.
[02:47:00.986 --> 02:47:07.231]  Anyway, it's all junk in there and this stuff, you really need it because they are bombarding our toxins.

[02:48:36.262 --> 02:48:38.182]  You know, I got this thing in the markets.
[02:48:38.202 --> 02:48:38.962]  Let me go to the markets.
[02:48:39.923 --> 02:48:42.643]  The Dow was down almost 700 points.
[02:48:43.844 --> 02:48:45.144]  Got off the air and just came back.
[02:48:48.223 --> 02:48:51.787]  The euro is now at parity with the dollar.
[02:48:52.207 --> 02:48:53.108]  This is very important.
[02:48:53.869 --> 02:48:59.575]  The only reason the dollar is strong is because the other economies are so weak.
[02:49:02.998 --> 02:49:09.885]  The inflation rate in Europe, I forgot exactly what it is, it's either 8.6 or 8.9 percent.
[02:49:13.365 --> 02:49:18.788]  Their interest rate is only 0%, 0% interest rate.
[02:49:21.069 --> 02:49:25.772]  And they make fun of Turkey for lowering their interest rates as inflation goes up when they've done the same thing.
[02:49:27.052 --> 02:49:35.497]  Mexico has, they're looking at a 10% annual inflation rate.
[02:49:35.997 --> 02:49:37.778]  Their interest rate is 8.5%.
[02:49:39.879 --> 02:49:42.381]  Now, remember I said, look, God.
[02:49:43.598 --> 02:49:45.459]  I've got some.
[02:49:45.799 --> 02:49:50.401]  The euro is at parity with the dollar.
[02:49:51.141 --> 02:49:53.482]  That means that inflation is going higher.
[02:49:53.522 --> 02:49:55.423]  It's costing you more to buy things.
[02:49:56.703 --> 02:49:59.185]  So the markets in the United States are down.
[02:49:59.945 --> 02:50:00.925]  The dollar is up.
[02:50:01.726 --> 02:50:04.567]  But oil prices are still staying high.
[02:50:04.627 --> 02:50:07.368]  They're at $96 a barrel for Brent crude.
[02:50:09.321 --> 02:50:17.325]  So when you put it all together and then because of the sanctions that the imbeciles beginning with Joe B.S.
[02:50:17.445 --> 02:50:26.689]  Biden and then the rest of the Europeans put on the Russians, the gas prices are spiking.
[02:50:26.729 --> 02:50:29.191]  Today they hit another, you know, near record high.
[02:50:31.492 --> 02:50:38.455]  So now as it's costing you more to buy a lot less, this is dragflation.
[02:50:39.696 --> 02:50:44.278]  But I guess they won't allow us to say it because you can't use the word drag, you know.
[02:50:44.859 --> 02:50:47.020]  Just like you can't say gay to feel happy.
[02:50:47.700 --> 02:50:49.261]  Like I could care who anybody was.
[02:50:49.341 --> 02:50:50.782]  I got a load of friends, you know.
[02:50:51.422 --> 02:50:53.843]  Gay, straight, upside down, inside out.
[02:50:53.883 --> 02:50:54.944]  So take it easy.
[02:50:55.624 --> 02:50:56.745]  But this BS.
[02:50:57.725 --> 02:51:05.810]  We have sent out tens of thousands of press releases saying this is not stagflation, it's dragflation.
[02:51:06.390 --> 02:51:08.111]  And the media refuses to report it.
[02:51:08.957 --> 02:51:11.959]  Economies are dragging down as inflation's going up.
[02:51:12.399 --> 02:51:13.600]  The facts are there.
[02:51:13.660 --> 02:51:14.761]  I'm not making this up.
[02:51:17.823 --> 02:51:21.405]  You have inflation spiking as GDPs are declining.
[02:51:25.368 --> 02:51:40.424]   And the EU, the UK, where they put an F and a U and a C, whatever you want to throw into it because the clown's running it, that UK over there, They got a 10%, they're looking at 10% inflation rate.
[02:51:41.744 --> 02:51:45.445]  And they only have an interest rate of 1.75%.
[02:51:45.985 --> 02:51:50.085]  And the fuel prices, they're escalating as well because of the sanctions they put on.
[02:51:52.246 --> 02:51:58.627]  We are in the midst of the worst market crash in economic volatility in modern history.
[02:52:02.128 --> 02:52:04.168]  And when all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:52:05.754 --> 02:52:15.260]  They're saying that the Russians are bombing this Ukrainian plant, nuclear power plant, that they're in charge of, that all their troops are in?
[02:52:16.060 --> 02:52:17.942]  Why would they bomb a place that they're in?
[02:52:19.823 --> 02:52:21.084]  Ukrainians are doing it.
[02:52:22.304 --> 02:52:32.931]  As I said, World War I won't... World War I... World War III won't become official until there's a major attack, be it false flag, nuclear, whatever.
[02:52:34.580 --> 02:52:37.601]  Just like they say Pearl Harbor started World War II.
[02:52:38.181 --> 02:52:44.003]  And by the way, 80% of the Americans were against getting involved in World War II before Pearl Harbor.
[02:52:46.424 --> 02:52:51.886]  Same thing with World War I. Assassinated the Archduke Ferdinand of Sarajevo.
[02:52:51.906 --> 02:52:53.547]  He's a Lithuanian.
[02:52:55.027 --> 02:52:58.648]  Lithuania, Lithuania, Lithuania, Greenberg, Iceberg.
[02:52:58.668 --> 02:52:59.389]  What's the difference?
[02:52:59.409 --> 02:53:00.389]  It's all a bunch of baloney.
[02:53:03.268 --> 02:53:05.330]  Oh, and how about that Prime Minister of Finland?
[02:53:05.450 --> 02:53:09.354]  Oh, how she talks so serious like this and then she's, you know, yeah.
[02:53:10.115 --> 02:53:11.056]  It's a freak show.
[02:53:11.296 --> 02:53:16.401]  Like that Gavin Newsom, the arrogant little boy that they're gonna, looks like they're gonna run for the Democrats.
[02:53:18.022 --> 02:53:18.583]  The President.
[02:53:19.484 --> 02:53:24.349]  Locks down everybody while he's up at the French Laundry eating like three, four hundred dollar plate dinners.
[02:53:27.432 --> 02:53:27.572]  Yep.
[02:53:29.773 --> 02:53:36.035]  So going back to the economy, this thing's going to go down big, it's going to go down hard, and it's going to go down fast when we start.
[02:53:36.275 --> 02:53:39.096]  People are on vacation, now we're going to get two weeks of quietness.
[02:53:40.296 --> 02:53:43.497]  The markets could go berserk, but they're not trading very heavy now.
[02:53:43.517 --> 02:53:56.001]  This is the last week of August, is the slowest week of the year, in terms of news and everything, because people are winding out in summer, and then you have Labor Day weekend.
[02:53:56.021 --> 02:53:58.142]  So there's going to be two weeks of quietness in there.
[02:53:59.344 --> 02:54:00.845]  And then the reality is going to hit.
[02:54:01.425 --> 02:54:06.849]  I got this mail from Citi Group.
[02:54:08.230 --> 02:54:08.750]  From Citi.
[02:54:09.571 --> 02:54:14.454]  Earn up to $3,500 when you open a Citi saving account.
[02:54:16.716 --> 02:54:22.700]  Let's see if I put in $10,000 to $30,000.
[02:54:26.463 --> 02:54:28.984]  I earned a grand total of $40.
[02:54:30.846 --> 02:54:32.566]  If I put in $100,000 to $200,000 at $199,999, I earned a grand total of $400.
[02:54:32.607 --> 02:54:34.127]  You gotta put in a million bucks to earn $3,500.
[02:54:34.287 --> 02:54:34.928]  All right?
[02:54:34.948 --> 02:54:38.870]  That shows you how rigged the game is.
[02:54:38.729 --> 02:54:40.930]  In total, $400.
[02:54:40.930 --> 02:54:45.930]  You gotta put in a million bucks to earn $3,500.
[02:54:45.930 --> 02:54:47.729]  All right?
[02:54:47.729 --> 02:54:49.889]  That shows you how rigged the game is.
[02:54:49.889 --> 02:54:52.270]  A million bucks.
[02:54:52.270 --> 02:54:56.989]   Once upon a time when I was a young man, they had things called interest rates.
[02:54:57.045 --> 02:54:59.766]  And when you put money in the bank, you used to get interest on it.
[02:55:02.788 --> 02:55:03.168]  No more.
[02:55:04.228 --> 02:55:06.790]  We're plantation workers of Slavelandia.
[02:55:08.250 --> 02:55:12.493]  And if we don't reverse it, World War III's begun.
[02:55:12.513 --> 02:55:15.054]  The crime rates are escalating all over the place.
[02:55:17.175 --> 02:55:20.537]  The Ukraine War's gonna bring us into World War III if we don't stop it.
[02:55:21.403 --> 02:55:30.409]  And as the cover of the Trends Journal for this week coming up, if you support war, you support Satan.
[02:55:31.249 --> 02:55:32.950]  And by the way, I'm not a pacifist.
[02:55:33.030 --> 02:55:38.814]  I'm a fighter, a black belt, close combat martial artist.
[02:55:41.055 --> 02:55:42.556]  I only attack the attacker.
[02:55:46.999 --> 02:55:48.920]  So we have to unite for peace.
[02:55:50.991 --> 02:55:54.511]  Divided we stand, divided we die.
[02:55:54.511 --> 02:56:01.871]  [Music]
[02:56:01.871 --> 02:56:05.871]   I've heard it thousands and thousands of times and I know you have as well.
[02:56:06.736 --> 02:56:08.996]  Why don't more people stand up for freedom?
[02:56:09.636 --> 02:56:12.617]  Why don't more people fight the globalists and their tyranny?
[02:56:13.297 --> 02:56:17.518]  And the answer is, when you fight them, they come after you.
[02:56:19.127 --> 02:56:21.389]  And the enemies of freedom have come after Infowars.
[02:56:21.409 --> 02:56:22.289]  They've come after us.
[02:56:22.589 --> 02:56:25.091]  They're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[02:56:25.391 --> 02:56:29.174]  And they're on national television saying we want to shut Alex Jones down.
[02:56:29.714 --> 02:56:32.116]  Because they see us as populist, which we are.
[02:56:32.496 --> 02:56:38.000]  They see us as the archetypal example of people that aren't bowing to them.
[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:42.882]  I don't care if you're black, white, old, young, or where you came from in America or anywhere else in the world.
[02:56:43.622 --> 02:56:56.448]  These globalists hate the general public and they hate men more than anything because men historically have been the ones during times of tyranny to rally to the evil and say no.
[02:56:57.472 --> 02:57:01.416]  And that's why they're coming after us with everything they've got.
[02:57:01.977 --> 02:57:04.320]  So when you ask, why doesn't somebody stand up against this evil?
[02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:07.363]  The answer is because most people don't want to take the attacks.
[02:57:08.064 --> 02:57:14.051]  But now it's become clear that submitting to the attacks is way more dangerous and way more sickening.
[02:57:15.316 --> 02:57:16.256]  I don't want to go one further.
[02:57:16.276 --> 02:57:17.937]  You actually die on your knees.
[02:57:17.756 --> 02:57:23.496]   with slavery, especially during the endgame, is worse than death. It was Zapata, the great
[02:57:23.496 --> 02:57:27.736]   Mexican revolutionary that said, "It's better to die on your feet than live on your knees
[02:57:27.736 --> 02:57:34.176]   as slaves." I want to go one further. You actually die on your knees. You live on your
[02:57:34.176 --> 02:57:39.815]   feet. I'm not fighting these people because it's some lost cause and it's just the right
[02:57:40.624 --> 02:57:41.884]  I'd do that if it was the case.
[02:57:42.504 --> 02:57:48.686]  I'd do it because I believe in you and I know we can beat these people, but I need you to believe in yourself.
[02:57:49.406 --> 02:58:06.030]   So at this critical juncture, while the enemies of humanity are doing everything they can to try to silence you and your family, It is more important than ever that you spread the word about InfoWars and about the reports and the guests we have because they fear us for a good reason.
[02:58:06.091 --> 02:58:08.032]  We've got their number and we know how to beat them.
[02:58:09.092 --> 02:58:13.055]  Separately, we try to sell the best products we can because we want them to work.
[02:58:13.075 --> 02:58:13.896]  We want you to love them.
[02:58:13.916 --> 02:58:15.076]  We want you to come back and get them.
[02:58:15.337 --> 02:58:17.238]  They took our sponsors away more than a decade ago.
[02:58:17.918 --> 02:58:24.062]  And our flagship product that has funded so much of the great work we've done together, thanks to your support, is DNA Force+.

[02:59:34.823 --> 02:59:38.745]  You already know you're the tip of the spear because you are the supporters of this broadcast.
[02:59:39.226 --> 02:59:41.047]  You see how much InfoWars is hated.
[02:59:41.407 --> 02:59:45.410]  You see how much they're trying to shut us down because they're scared of you coalescing.
[02:59:45.630 --> 02:59:47.111]  They're scared of you coming together.
[02:59:47.131 --> 02:59:54.976]  They're scared of you supporting freedom and justice because they know it's so popular that if the free market of ideas is allowed, it's over for the New World Order.
