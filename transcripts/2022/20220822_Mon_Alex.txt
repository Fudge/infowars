[00:00.000 --> 00:21.160]  The
[00:21.160 --> 00:28.520]  spokesperson for evil has come out and said that their attempted world, continual, never-ending
[00:28.520 --> 00:37.760]  lockdown and forced injection failed.
[00:37.760 --> 00:43.520]  They put out a press release yesterday, they put out a podcast with Klaus Schwab and others,
[00:43.520 --> 00:50.320]  and they have declared their number one enemy, Info Wars, and have said that they've hired
[00:50.320 --> 00:58.720]  a hundred and ten thousand operatives that they called Information Warriors.
[00:58.720 --> 01:03.840]  Where have we heard that term before, the Info Warriors, to counter we the people?
[01:03.840 --> 01:12.560]  I mean, man, I keep trying to explain to the listeners, they're really scared of us, not
[01:12.560 --> 01:21.640]  just me, but the fact that we've got the Death Star plans.
[01:21.640 --> 01:26.960]  And if people pay attention, folks will know the future and out of counter what's about
[01:26.960 --> 01:30.200]  to go down, and that it's game over.
[01:30.200 --> 01:38.240]  And they are so panicked that we know their exact plans from deep research and total focus,
[01:38.240 --> 01:43.600]  and that if Congress and legislators and other leaders, like Bolsonaro, run with the ball,
[01:43.600 --> 01:54.960]  it's game over, Klaus Schwab's going to prison, like his grandfather, it's Nuremberg 2.0.
[01:54.960 --> 01:58.160]  But if we don't expose them, they're going to collapse civilization around us and pose
[01:58.160 --> 02:00.280]  us as favors.
[02:00.280 --> 02:06.640]  How honored are you as the Army of Info Wars to know that you're in direct conflict and
[02:06.640 --> 02:09.560]  information warfare with Klaus Schwab, the New World Order?
[02:09.560 --> 02:12.200]  Now do you understand why I say share the articles and videos?
[02:12.200 --> 02:16.560]  Now do you understand why I say magnify what we're doing?
[02:16.560 --> 02:20.520]  Because I don't want to be the best in the fight, because I'm not that good.
[02:20.520 --> 02:21.520]  I want to stop these people.
[02:21.520 --> 02:26.240]  I want to see other leaders like Tucker Carlson, Bolsonaro, Joe Rogan, countless others stand
[02:26.240 --> 02:27.640]  up and they're starting to.
[02:27.640 --> 02:34.400]  But you know what, the enemy recognizes us and me as the number one enemy of their New
[02:34.400 --> 02:46.160]  World Order.
[02:46.160 --> 02:51.040]  Alex Jones here issuing an emergency warning to President Trump.
[02:51.040 --> 02:57.680]  Not a warning out of any desire to hurt you, President Trump, but to save your important
[02:57.680 --> 03:04.000]  legacy and hopefully ensure you can get back into the White House coming up in 2024.
[03:04.000 --> 03:05.760]  We know the election was stolen.
[03:05.760 --> 03:09.480]  We know the deep stage trying to set you up any way they can.
[03:09.480 --> 03:15.280]  We understand that you are a lion surrounded by hyenas, but the number one issue that is
[03:15.280 --> 03:20.200]  going to end up biting you in the ass like nothing else is the experimental shot that
[03:20.200 --> 03:26.800]  Fauci and Bill Gates and Berks and the rest of them convinced you would actually save
[03:26.800 --> 03:30.840]  millions of lives and get the economy going when they had brought out their lockdowns.
[03:30.840 --> 03:32.440]  I know why you did it.
[03:32.440 --> 03:36.000]  You've done so many other great things for this nation and I admire you and I appreciate
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.760]  you and I want to support you for president.
[03:38.760 --> 03:43.400]  But Ron DeSantis is coming out and admitting that the vaccines don't work because now the
[03:43.400 --> 03:49.800]  CDC and others have been forced to admit that even as now even the CDC is backhandedly
[03:49.800 --> 03:54.640]  acknowledging that the shots aren't preventing people from getting infected.
[03:54.640 --> 04:00.600]  We have Deborah Berks coming out and saying she knew the COVID vaccine wouldn't protect.
[04:00.600 --> 04:06.160]  We have Walensky, the current head of the CDC coming out and saying that they were wrong
[04:06.160 --> 04:07.160]  about all this.
[04:07.160 --> 04:10.280]  We made some pretty public mistakes and we need to own them.
[04:10.280 --> 04:14.960]  This admission came after the CDC received the findings of an external review she ordered
[04:14.960 --> 04:16.440]  of the agency.
[04:16.440 --> 04:22.120]  The CDC says the review found the agency's COVID guidance was confusing and overwhelming.
[04:22.120 --> 04:26.160]  But you are still out there saying no it's great and you're proud of it.
[04:26.160 --> 04:31.760]  Now that they've admittedly set you and America and the world up with an experimental drug
[04:31.760 --> 04:37.600]  they rolled out of gene therapy against the general public it is critical for you to decouple
[04:37.600 --> 04:43.080]  from these people like Bolsonaro and other leaders like Victor Orban have done saying
[04:43.080 --> 04:47.480]  hey at first we were for this we thought it might help but now we know it doesn't work
[04:47.480 --> 04:51.080]  it's a fraud and we need to put the brakes on this.
[04:51.080 --> 04:52.640]  President Trump I care about you.
[04:52.640 --> 04:57.120]  I know you mean well you're a very smart man but they're coming after six months old and
[04:57.120 --> 04:59.520]  up babies with these dangerous shots.
[04:59.520 --> 05:04.720]  Ladies and gentlemen if millions of people get this book our funding problems will be
[05:04.720 --> 05:06.560]  over and it's starting to happen.
[05:06.560 --> 05:09.960]  That's why I said yeah go to infoworkstore.com get the book and start shipping in a couple
[05:09.960 --> 05:14.000]  weeks the great reset in the war for the world but I said go to Amazon because it's the number
[05:14.000 --> 05:19.280]  one book chart in the world and if it goes to number one not a political not of history
[05:19.280 --> 05:23.520]  not of US history it's already number one over 40 categories like political science
[05:23.520 --> 05:26.440]  you name it 40 plus categories is number one.
[05:26.440 --> 05:32.840]  Ladies and gentlemen drum roll please of books in the world the great reset in the war for
[05:32.840 --> 05:42.160]  the world is one two three four five six seven eight nine we are now number nine in the world.
[05:42.160 --> 05:47.680]  This is major this is political this could fund our war chest just go to amazon.com everybody
[05:47.680 --> 05:53.600]  and buy 10 copies send this blueprint to the death star and the new world order because
[05:53.600 --> 05:56.640]  you read this you know their whole plan how to stop them get the great reset in the war
[05:56.640 --> 06:09.560]  for the world now it's going to go to number one what do you make of that.
[06:09.560 --> 06:16.520]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from Austin Texas
[06:16.520 --> 06:33.520]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:33.520 --> 06:38.720]  We are being told that we must stop eating beef because the methane produced by cattle
[06:38.720 --> 06:45.240]  burps and farts is accelerating global warming so let's look at the science mass balance
[06:45.240 --> 06:52.840]  calculations take into account material being added exchanged and lost during natural processes
[06:52.840 --> 07:00.280]  and Australian geologist Ian Plymer breaks down this science in eat beef save the planet
[07:00.280 --> 07:07.320]  grass along with most plant life consumes carbon dioxide from the air as food the more
[07:07.320 --> 07:13.880]  CO2 the greener the environment so the theory that CO2 levels are hurting the environment
[07:13.880 --> 07:18.640]  is flawed from the start but for the sake of argument we can examine the science and
[07:18.640 --> 07:25.120]  see if cow farts actually are increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere the grass consumes
[07:25.120 --> 07:31.000]  CO2 from the air and when it dies methane is released which quickly separates into
[07:31.000 --> 07:38.200]  CO2 and water vapor when the grass is eaten by cattle this carbon is recycled in various
[07:38.200 --> 07:44.040]  ways cattle waste fertilizes the grass with some of this carbon and the rest is stored
[07:44.040 --> 07:51.480]  in meat milk blood intestines bones and skin thanks to the cattle carbon is taken from
[07:51.480 --> 07:58.200]  the grass and used as fertilizer stored in leather goods and consumed as food where most
[07:58.200 --> 08:04.480]  of it stays with the body until death and so the processes of meat production and consumption
[08:04.480 --> 08:11.120]  actually removes carbon from the atmosphere and recycles it elsewhere humans cattle and
[08:11.120 --> 08:18.320]  grass are all parts of the same natural ecosystem and carbon is the building block the entire
[08:18.320 --> 08:24.960]  anti meat agenda is built upon lies grass fed beef is so nutritious that in all beef
[08:24.960 --> 08:30.000]  diet has become a very popular choice for people cleansing and healing from several
[08:30.000 --> 08:36.000]  ailments and disease humans are omnivores and that means we have the ability to survive
[08:36.000 --> 08:42.000]  on both plants and animals our teeth are able to cut and masticate animal flesh and we have
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.280]  the digestive enzyme trypsin for breaking down meat which has allowed the human brain
[08:47.280 --> 08:53.400]  to grow larger over time allows us to grow stronger and operate more efficiently many
[08:53.400 --> 08:59.000]  people eat vegetarian diets because they believe that eating meat is immoral this argument is
[08:59.000 --> 09:04.560]  taught like a religion with the main rule being don't eat anything with a face which
[09:04.560 --> 09:10.120]  doesn't make any sense what about the millions of microorganisms we consume in a single glass
[09:10.120 --> 09:15.960]  of water do they not deserve the same respect experiments with plants and vegetables show
[09:15.960 --> 09:21.360]  how they feel pain and recognize the person who hurt them do they not deserve the same
[09:21.360 --> 09:27.600]  respect simply because they have no face a simple law of the physical natural world is
[09:27.600 --> 09:34.720]  that life is sustained by life every living thing sustains its own life by consuming other
[09:34.720 --> 09:41.360]  living things this is true of the carnivore the omnivore and the vegan the moral argument
[09:41.360 --> 09:47.920]  of veganism is just another ego trip many are learning veganism from modern yoga teachers
[09:47.920 --> 09:53.440]  as if it were an ancient religion but this is a myth the cow was sacred in traditional
[09:53.440 --> 10:00.320]  yoga because it sustained life vegetarianism was only promoted among the lower casts so
[10:00.320 --> 10:05.520]  that enough meat was available to the warrior and priest classes and that's all that's
[10:05.520 --> 10:13.000]  happening today the all-powerful 0.1% want us lower casts to eat bugs while they save
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.120]  the best for themselves but it's even worse than that they want us all to get sick and
[10:18.120 --> 10:24.200]  die in an evaluation of edible insects and the transmission of parasitic diseases one
[10:24.200 --> 10:30.600]  third of all insects studied were found to be pathogenic to humans and most insects contain
[10:30.600 --> 10:37.600]  titan which is a modified polysaccharide present in most insects and absent in all mammals
[10:37.600 --> 10:42.960]  we cannot digest it and it is known to cause several health issues with humans who consume
[10:42.960 --> 10:51.080]  it including respiratory issues and the accelerated growth of cancer cells the real problem isn't
[10:51.080 --> 10:57.080]  beef consumption it's factory farming and we can solve this by incentivizing local
[10:57.080 --> 11:06.320]  grass-fed cattle farming reporting for info wars this is greg reese that is what you call

[18:11.120 --> 18:17.840]  splits is that there is problems in the bedroom and the number one issue men have is erectile

[21:07.440 --> 21:08.440]  shiny diamonds

[21:31.440 --> 21:32.440]  here's the key
[21:32.440 --> 21:34.440]  between the velvet lies
[21:38.440 --> 21:39.440]  there's a truth
[21:39.440 --> 21:46.440]  there's a truth as hard as steel
[21:46.440 --> 21:48.440]  the vision never dies
[21:53.440 --> 21:55.440]  alright let's get to the big news here
[21:55.440 --> 22:00.440]  I know for a fact and I told you this a couple years ago that Elon Musk was riding the fence
[22:00.440 --> 22:05.440]  and that he decided to fight the new world order at least he told his top advisors that
[22:05.440 --> 22:10.440]  he was going for a pro human future and to not depopulate the earth and to fight the new
[22:10.440 --> 22:13.440]  world order now whether he's being legitimate or not
[22:13.440 --> 22:16.440]  Christ says you judge a tree by its fruits
[22:17.440 --> 22:21.440]  look what Elon tweeted out yesterday got hundreds of thousands of retweets
[22:21.440 --> 22:22.440]  Elon Musk
[22:23.440 --> 22:25.440]  here's the actual image
[22:26.440 --> 22:30.440]  please let me use the CERN Large Hadron Collider
[22:30.440 --> 22:35.440]  I'm normal and can be trusted with the demonic technology
[22:35.440 --> 22:37.440]  unlike anything the world has ever seen
[22:39.440 --> 22:42.440]  what is a demonic technology
[22:42.440 --> 22:45.440]  well they admit they're trying to find the
[22:46.440 --> 22:47.440]  God particle
[22:49.440 --> 22:55.440]  they admit they're trying to create artificial black holes and strangelets that create particles so strong
[22:55.440 --> 23:01.440]  it sinks the center of the earth and then creates a black hole that implodes the entire planet
[23:01.440 --> 23:04.440]  it's not a Star Trek movie it's reality
[23:04.440 --> 23:06.440]  and they're there
[23:06.440 --> 23:12.440]  it blew up a few years ago the last time they tried it now they're doing these tests again
[23:12.440 --> 23:18.440]  and while they're doing the tests they're constantly doing satanic rituals above ground
[23:18.440 --> 23:20.440]  on the facilities
[23:21.440 --> 23:22.440]  acreage
[23:22.440 --> 23:27.440]  so here's another Gregory's report from a few months ago where we come back and hit all the Russian news
[23:27.440 --> 23:29.440]  the economy news is so much more but
[23:29.440 --> 23:35.440]  Elon Musk is now putting out tweets about demonic technology that could destroy the earth
[23:35.440 --> 23:37.440]  and the evidence is that's true
[23:38.440 --> 23:42.440]  these people aren't playing games
[23:42.440 --> 23:44.440]  Elon Musk
[23:44.440 --> 23:47.440]  please let me use the CERN Large Hadron Collider
[23:47.440 --> 23:52.440]  I'm normal and can be trusted with a demonic technology like anything the world has ever seen
[23:52.440 --> 23:57.440]  here is the report posted at band.video I suggest you watch it and share it
[24:04.440 --> 24:10.440]  CERN is an acronym that translates to European Council for Nuclear Research
[24:10.440 --> 24:14.440]  but has since moved on to studying particle physics
[24:14.440 --> 24:18.440]  and even though they invented the internet in 1989
[24:18.440 --> 24:22.440]  they are most famous for their 666 logo
[24:22.440 --> 24:26.440]  a video of a woman being ritually sacrificed on CERN grounds
[24:26.440 --> 24:30.440]  at the altar of Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction
[24:30.440 --> 24:34.440]  and for potentially destroying the universe
[24:34.440 --> 24:40.440]  multiple lawsuits have been filed to stop CERN's particle collider
[24:40.440 --> 24:44.440]  in fear that it could destroy the earth
[24:44.440 --> 24:48.440]  which revealed to the public that CERN is a sovereign entity
[24:48.440 --> 24:51.440]  outside the jurisdiction of the courts
[24:51.440 --> 24:53.440]  so they can do whatever they want
[24:53.440 --> 24:55.440]  what is it that they're doing?
[24:55.440 --> 24:59.440]  it has to do with high velocity counter rotational spin
[24:59.440 --> 25:04.440]  which was first documented in Nazi Germany's most secret program
[25:04.440 --> 25:06.440]  the Glock, the Bell
[25:06.440 --> 25:08.440]  according to surviving documents
[25:08.440 --> 25:11.440]  the bell was somehow affecting time and space
[25:11.440 --> 25:14.440]  the most distinctive aspect of the bell
[25:14.440 --> 25:17.440]  was high velocity counter rotational spin
[25:17.440 --> 25:20.440]  also known as torsion physics
[25:20.440 --> 25:24.440]  many are concerned that CERN is attempting to open a portal
[25:24.440 --> 25:29.440]  into another dimension that will allow demonic entities to enter ours
[25:29.440 --> 25:34.440]  this was blatantly portrayed 6 years ago in a pagan ritual
[25:34.440 --> 25:39.440]  to commemorate the opening of the Gothard tunnel, just east of CERN
[25:39.440 --> 25:44.440]  the dimension they would be attempting to open is already somewhat accessible
[25:44.440 --> 25:46.440]  do you hear voices in your head?
[25:46.440 --> 25:51.440]  if you do, then you likely know it's best to keep that to yourself
[25:51.440 --> 25:54.440]  because a doctor will tell you that you're a schizophrenic
[25:54.440 --> 25:59.440]  modern psychiatry calls these voices auditory hallucinations
[25:59.440 --> 26:05.440]  and even though a whopping 1% of the world's population suffers from schizophrenia
[26:05.440 --> 26:07.440]  there isn't much research
[26:07.440 --> 26:11.440]  but after 30 years of working closely with the criminally insane
[26:11.440 --> 26:16.440]  Jerry Marzinski has noticed that the voices talking to these schizophrenics
[26:16.440 --> 26:18.440]  are all saying the same things
[26:18.440 --> 26:21.440]  there is a distinct predictable pattern
[26:21.440 --> 26:26.440]  the voices are exclusively generating negative emotion
[26:26.440 --> 26:30.440]  leaving the patient physically and emotionally drained
[26:30.440 --> 26:35.440]  the voices are always pulling a person away from God or anything positive
[26:35.440 --> 26:38.440]  the voices are always a call to action
[26:38.440 --> 26:43.440]  instructing the person to either hurt themselves or hurt someone else
[26:43.440 --> 26:50.440]  which is probably why the voices always rebel against the drugs that are prescribed for schizophrenia
[26:50.440 --> 26:53.440]  these drugs make a person comatose
[26:53.440 --> 26:56.440]  and the voices want you to do things
[26:56.440 --> 27:01.440]  Marzinski believes that schizophrenics are being attacked by non-physical entities
[27:01.440 --> 27:04.440]  that he calls energy parasites
[27:04.440 --> 27:07.440]  because they feed off of negative energy
[27:07.440 --> 27:09.440]  and in practically every case
[27:09.440 --> 27:12.440]  the victim has experienced severe trauma
[27:12.440 --> 27:14.440]  usually sexual trauma
[27:14.440 --> 27:19.440]  which explains why the voices tell people to traumatize others
[27:19.440 --> 27:22.440]  these demons want more victims
[27:22.440 --> 27:25.440]  according to the ancient Gnostics
[27:25.440 --> 27:28.440]  who refer to these entities as Archons
[27:28.440 --> 27:31.440]  they are destructive sadistic beings
[27:31.440 --> 27:35.440]  who control the earth via the thoughts of humans
[27:35.440 --> 27:37.440]  voices in the head
[27:37.440 --> 27:41.440]  this explains the rampant pedophilia we are seeing today
[27:41.440 --> 27:44.440]  and the incestuous inbreeding of royal bloodlines
[27:44.440 --> 27:50.440]  these energy parasites need traumatized people to feed upon
[27:50.440 --> 27:53.440]  perhaps some of the thoughts in our own mind
[27:53.440 --> 27:56.440]  are not our own
[27:56.440 --> 27:59.440]  most schizophrenics claim that this is the case
[27:59.440 --> 28:03.440]  but are told by doctors that they are crazy
[28:03.440 --> 28:08.440]  doctors who only give them lobotomies, electroshock and drugs
[28:08.440 --> 28:12.440]  and Marzinski has only seen schizophrenics recover
[28:12.440 --> 28:16.440]  once they start seeing these voices as an external entity
[28:16.440 --> 28:20.440]  they then realize that they can actually resist them
[28:20.440 --> 28:22.440]  and the voices go away
[28:22.440 --> 28:26.440]  and so while CERN is a great mystery and a concern
[28:26.440 --> 28:30.440]  the demons from another dimension may already be here
[28:30.440 --> 28:32.440]  in our thoughts
[28:32.440 --> 28:36.440]  so it's a good thing we all have free will

[33:41.440 --> 33:45.440]  universe lays before us
[33:45.440 --> 33:49.440]  our ancestors
[33:49.440 --> 33:52.440]  are empowering us
[33:52.440 --> 33:54.440]  and our progeny will look back on us
[33:54.440 --> 33:56.440]  as heroes
[33:56.440 --> 33:58.440]  that with God's energy
[33:58.440 --> 34:00.440]  brought our species to the next level
[34:00.440 --> 34:09.440]  music
[34:09.440 --> 34:11.440]  yeah God's got me
[34:11.440 --> 34:16.440]  You have. You got me. You got me.
[34:16.440 --> 34:24.440]  You. You have. You have. You have me. You have me.
[34:24.440 --> 34:29.440]  You asked me. You asked me. You asked me.
[34:29.440 --> 34:32.440]  And I didn't say anything.
[34:32.440 --> 34:43.440]  Nine. Nine. No. Two.
[34:43.440 --> 34:48.440]  Nine. Nine. From Africa to Europe.
[34:48.440 --> 34:53.440]  From Latin America to North America to Asia to Eurasia.
[34:53.440 --> 35:01.440]  Humanity is waking up and saying no to Klaus Schwab and no to the New World Order.
[35:01.440 --> 35:04.440]  Nine. Nine.
[35:04.440 --> 35:07.440]  All right, here it is.
[35:07.440 --> 35:28.440]  Dr. Fauci has issued his resignation letter after 40 plus years running different federal agencies, murdering people, blocking treatments, engage in HIV rollout, the Wuhan lab, this murderous, discredited monster.
[35:28.440 --> 35:40.440]  This Hitler 2.0, this Bill Gates prosthesis has now resigned.
[35:40.440 --> 35:58.440]  I'm announcing today that I have been stepping down from the positions of director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief of NIAID, laboratory of immunolidization, as well as the position of chief medical advisor to President Joe Biden.
[35:58.440 --> 36:10.440]  I will be leaving these positions in December of this year to pursue the next chapter of my career.
[36:10.440 --> 36:13.440]  He now wants everybody to take polio shots again.
[36:13.440 --> 36:29.440]  So we told you that climate was polio when you got paralysis from the poison shots and the record levels of heart attacks will be detailing next hour.
[36:29.440 --> 36:31.440]  What a monster.
[36:31.440 --> 36:33.440]  Wall Street Journal.
[36:33.440 --> 36:50.440]  Polio vaccines are urged in New York as once defeated virus lurks. Man, we got monkeypox, we got polio, we got record deaths all over the world where people took the shots and it's all supposedly were told something else killing people.
[36:50.440 --> 36:52.440]  The hysteria continues.
[36:52.440 --> 37:07.440]  Angela's Public Health offers free COVID-19 testing for pets after city records, zero pet cases, all part of the biomedical tyranny and the hysteria. What a fraud.
[37:07.440 --> 37:14.440]  What a lie.
[37:14.440 --> 37:28.440]  They see us as a cancer and they see themselves as the cure and no amount of fake fact checkers, no amount of hand wringing, no amount of disinformation will ever put their fraud back together again.
[37:28.440 --> 37:32.440]  The system is in collapse.
[37:32.440 --> 37:52.440]  Former Fox News political editor Chris Starwalt blast network for inciting black helicopter level paranoia and hatred. Oh, Fox is bad because it doesn't 100% go along with the disinformation and lies.
[37:52.440 --> 38:00.440]  Brian Stelter signs off reliable sources of CNN left in limbo with basically no viewers.
[38:00.440 --> 38:04.440]  Oh, that's the fault of disinformation.
[38:04.440 --> 38:14.440]  They'd be popular if no one was there challenging their long history of lies and if they could just take Alex Jones off the air.
[38:14.440 --> 38:22.440]  They believe they could finally be a real boy again.
[38:22.440 --> 38:39.440]  What a disgusting joke. All their fake attacks, the hundreds of thousands of articles and thousands of TV programs attacking us in the last few years only made us more effective and only made world leaders tune in and all the major intelligence agencies who we're
[38:39.440 --> 38:54.440]  departmentalizing. We know more than they do because we're not inside their paradigm of brainwashing. I don't say that from position of arrogance or position of smugness or bravada or Hootspa or hubris.
[38:54.440 --> 39:00.440]  I say it from position of reality.
[39:00.440 --> 39:09.440]  We have a fighting chance against these people because of you, because of our guests, because of your backing this hardcore operation.
[39:09.440 --> 39:18.440]  That said, though, the enemies of freedom aren't giving up.
[39:18.440 --> 39:31.440]  Alexander Dugan had his own Russian world domination plan for Eurasia and I had him on the show, been on his show, disagreed with him, said I wanted the West to work with Russia.
[39:31.440 --> 39:41.440]  I wanted a college of ideas and freedom. He said it's not going to happen because of your elites. Maybe he's right. Maybe he's wrong and he and his daughter were in the arena.
[39:41.440 --> 39:51.440]  But she was blown up as you know a day and a half ago in the suburb of Moscow. They changed cars because he was going to talk to somebody and do an interview separately.
[39:51.440 --> 39:57.440]  And his Land Cruiser got blown up right in front of him with his daughter and it's terrible.
[39:57.440 --> 40:20.440]  What's sick is then watching US news and British news and other Ukrainian news celebrate and say she deserved to die because he's a quote fascist, he's a nationalist while separately claiming Putin and Alexander Dugan blew up his daughter with no evidence.
[40:20.440 --> 40:27.440]  I had one in Telegraph. I have NBC News. I'm all saying, oh, Putin probably blew his daughter up.
[40:27.440 --> 40:35.440]  Now they have free speech and it's possible that could have been the case. They could have staged your death. I'm not saying that happened.
[40:35.440 --> 40:44.440]  Looks to me pretty real in the film and Ukraine and the people running it who call them fascists with their open Nazis had said we're going to kill Putin.
[40:44.440 --> 40:51.440]  Hell, Lindsey Graham's called for it. Others have called for it and they said we're going to kill Alexander Dugan.
[40:51.440 --> 41:00.440]  So they're celebrating killing her and saying they had the order out to kill her. Hell, they got the front man of Pink Floyd.
[41:00.440 --> 41:19.440]  It's on the same Ukrainian government website hit list. Mr. Waters, they're going to blow him up. And when they blow waters up, God forbid, are they going to say he staged his own death?
[41:19.440 --> 41:30.440]  And remember, I've got a $49 million or whatever judgment, even though in Texas it's capped way less than that, a few million, against me for questioning a mass shooting.
[41:30.440 --> 41:36.440]  There's like a question, Jesse Schmollett, WMDs in Iraq, so there's more. But oh, it's bad when I question. They went further.
[41:36.440 --> 41:43.440]  They're saying in London Telegraph, other publications, that Dugan murdered his daughter. I didn't say the Sandy Hook parents killed their kids.
[41:43.440 --> 41:51.440]  I said, I thought it might not have happened or something. There was a cover up because there was a police cover up because of malfeasance.
[41:51.440 --> 41:59.440]  Think about that, ladies and gentlemen. No, the truth is in the Russian news, they're talking about a coup against Putin because he's not been hardcore enough against Ukraine.
[41:59.440 --> 42:07.440]  And the Russians in major polls are 90 plus percent wanting full on war, which I don't want. I'm not on the Russian side.
[42:07.440 --> 42:15.440]  I'm not on the U.S. side as the U.S. is occupied by globalists. I'm on the side of survival and not having nuclear war.
[42:15.440 --> 42:27.440]  But you've got all these armchair quarterbacks who've never been in a fight in their lives, never shot a gun.
[42:27.440 --> 42:34.440]  Most of them have never been in a war, certainly, who are saying that they want full out nuclear war.
[42:34.440 --> 42:41.440]  Hell, we see it all the time. Liberals, the New York Times, let's just nuke Russia. Oh, yeah. Then their submarines pop up and blow us all up.
[42:41.440 --> 42:48.440]  Man, this has got destruction written all over it. We've got some of those clips coming up and more, and then two big guests.
[42:48.440 --> 42:56.440]  They've not spent enough time on the poison shots. They've tried to distract us with other issues, but the poison shots is the key issue.
[42:56.440 --> 43:12.440]  But the Cavalry for your immune system, the Cavalry for your health, and the Cavalry to keep Info Wars on the air with funding has now arrived, a 360 win.
[43:12.440 --> 43:29.440]  Almost sold out for a year. DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ-10 and all the patented documented super ingredients to completely turbocharge your immune system and your body is finally back in stock.
[43:29.440 --> 43:35.440]  And despite the fact it's going to sell out quick, I want those of you that haven't experienced it to get it.
[43:35.440 --> 43:42.440]  And I want long-term supporters to experience it as well, so it is 50% off out of the gates for a limited time.
[43:42.440 --> 43:49.440]  DNA Force Plus, finally back in stock at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[43:49.440 --> 43:59.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a symbiotic relationship. Supporting Info Wars defeats the globalist, and this product does amazing things for your body. Take action now.
[43:59.440 --> 44:05.440]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[44:05.440 --> 44:13.440]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with. And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[44:13.440 --> 44:18.440]  You might not agree with everything. You might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information.
[44:18.440 --> 44:29.440]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here. Thank you for that, Ward. InfoWarsStore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, InfoWarsStore.com is where to get them, folks, and we do have the best supplements.
[44:29.440 --> 44:38.440]  I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, we do the best with our supplements as well.
[44:38.440 --> 44:44.440]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula. Folks, this is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away. It's 75% off.
[44:44.440 --> 44:51.440]  By the way, it works for me. In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[44:51.440 --> 44:59.440]  Quite well, I might add. Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men. I go and see them quite often now.
[44:59.440 --> 45:14.440]  Seven months ago, in December of 2021, we launched the first in the three-coin founding member series, George Washington Slaying the Dragon. Then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin.
[45:14.440 --> 45:25.440]  There are only 75 coins left in the three-point series, exclusively right now at 1776point.com.
[45:25.440 --> 45:31.440]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members for this big project we're launching in the near future,
[45:31.440 --> 45:38.440]  you'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made of the sheepdog chasing the wolf in a personal message.
[45:38.440 --> 45:44.440]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776point.com.
[45:44.440 --> 45:49.440]  This is history happening now. InfoWarsStore support is changing the world.
[45:49.440 --> 45:59.440]  And this is the final 75 three-coin set exclusively available at 1776point.com.
[45:59.440 --> 46:08.440]  Alex Jones expanded his broadcast by selling a line of products focused on healing from the toxic world of a corrupt system,
[46:08.440 --> 46:16.440]  which has allowed InfoWars to remain a free public broadcast to combat the dangerous lies of the mainstream media.
[46:16.440 --> 46:23.440]  Alex Jones is patient zero for alternative facts.
[46:23.440 --> 46:26.440]  Do you understand what I have said?
[46:26.440 --> 46:29.440]  Yes, I believe what I said was true.
[46:29.440 --> 46:35.440]  Yes, you believe everything you say is true, but it isn't. Your beliefs do not make something true.
[46:35.440 --> 46:38.440]  That is what we're doing here.
[46:38.440 --> 46:45.440]  There's going to be a large set of planets who are going to be dividing up the corpse of InfoWars in the bankruptcy estate.
[46:45.440 --> 46:51.440]  The InfoWars audience has mobilized and awakened the world to the threat that is globalism.
[46:51.440 --> 47:18.440]  And with your continued support, we will keep going. Join us now and support the InfoWars.
[47:18.440 --> 47:33.440]  We are go. Initiate resistance operations. Target, globalist. We are go. And they are go against any resistance.
[47:33.440 --> 47:44.440]  We see the earth from here.
[47:44.440 --> 47:52.440]  Now, here's the BBC yesterday saying, hey, it's great to kill him, kill his daughter, kill Alexander Duggan. Liberal.
[47:52.440 --> 47:57.440]  But if you criticize the government, that's hateful or don't want a transgender man in a UFC beating up women.
[47:57.440 --> 48:01.440]  That's bad, but blowing up women in car bombs. That's liberal. Here it is.
[48:01.440 --> 48:14.440]  And to the extent we can actually fight an ideologist of this war, he would be it. So attacking him really is an attack on the whole foundation, the foundational ideas that this war is based on.
[48:14.440 --> 48:18.440]  He apparently was intending to travel in that car and then switch to another car.
[48:18.440 --> 48:24.440]  So it looks like he probably was the intended target. Now, she would be a logical target as well.
[48:24.440 --> 48:36.440]  She basically carries on his legacy of fascism. She has been calling Ukrainian subhumans, calling for wiping them out like her dad has been for quite some time.
[48:36.440 --> 48:45.440]  So to hit them both at the same time would be an especially attractive way of actually fighting this battle on the part of the Ukrainians.
[48:45.440 --> 48:50.440]  It's possible that this was actually done by Ukrainian forces or Ukrainian agents in Moscow.
[48:50.440 --> 48:58.440]  It's also possible that this hit was carried out by like anti-fascist, anti-war Russians in either case.
[48:58.440 --> 49:03.440]  This has to give Putin pause and it's certainly sending shock waves to the Russian elite tonight.
[49:03.440 --> 49:05.440]  This is...
[49:05.440 --> 49:11.440]  Oh, he's a fascist, though he opposed the Ukrainian actual Nazis that howl Hitler.
[49:11.440 --> 49:17.440]  Remember Hillary Clinton? Long time ago now. How many years ago? Eight years ago? Nine years ago?
[49:17.440 --> 49:25.440]  They go into Libya. They have them sign a deal. They betray him. They overthrow the country. They torture Gaddafi to death.
[49:25.440 --> 49:32.440]  And now all of Africa is collapsing. He was stabilizing it. They rape and torture him to death.
[49:32.440 --> 49:42.440]  And then Hillary comes and brags. We came. We saw he died, though she couldn't wipe her own ugly, fat, work-covered ass.
[49:42.440 --> 49:47.440]  I mean, it's just totally sick. Here's Hillary.
[49:47.440 --> 49:48.440]  Unconfirmed videos.
[49:48.440 --> 49:52.440]  Yes, we came. We saw. He died.
[49:52.440 --> 49:54.440]  Unconfirmed videos.
[49:54.440 --> 50:00.440]  Yes, we came. We saw. He died.
[50:00.440 --> 50:02.440]  Starting all these wars.
[50:02.440 --> 50:07.440]  Here is Lindsey Graham, right when Trump was getting in, with John McCain over there saying,
[50:07.440 --> 50:13.440]  we're going to war with the Russians and then starting wars with the Russian ethnic areas that are almost 100% Russian.
[50:13.440 --> 50:16.440]  Again, I'm not for Russia attacking back, but they started the fight.
[50:16.440 --> 50:19.440]  Even the Pope says that, because it's true.
[50:19.440 --> 50:24.440]  Even the Pope says three months ago, this needs to stop. The West started this. It could cause World War III.
[50:24.440 --> 50:26.440]  This is dangerous, ladies and gentlemen.
[50:26.440 --> 50:30.440]  Even the New World Order Pope says this shouldn't be happening.
[50:30.440 --> 50:32.440]  Here's Lindsey Graham.
[50:32.440 --> 50:35.440]  I admire the fact that you will fight for your homeland.
[50:35.440 --> 50:39.440]  I realize that you will fight for our homeland.
[50:39.440 --> 50:41.440]  Your fight is our fight.
[50:41.440 --> 50:43.440]  Our fight is our fight.
[50:43.440 --> 50:45.440]  In 2017, it's the year of our offense.
[50:49.440 --> 50:54.440]  We'll go back to Washington, and we'll push the case against Russia.
[50:54.440 --> 51:12.940]  against Russia. Enough of a Russian aggression. It is time for them to pay a heavier price.
[51:12.940 --> 51:21.440]  Our fight is not with the Russian people but with Putin. Our promise to you is to take
[51:21.440 --> 51:36.940]  your cause to Washington. Inform the American people of your bravery and make the case against
[51:36.940 --> 51:47.840]  Putin to the world. I believe you will win. I am convinced you will win and we will do
[51:47.840 --> 52:03.540]  everything we can to provide you with what you need to win. We have succeeded not because
[52:03.540 --> 52:19.540]  of equipment but because of your courage. So I thank you and the world is watching and
[52:19.540 --> 52:27.140]  the world is watching because we cannot allow Vladimir Putin to succeed here because if
[52:27.140 --> 52:52.140]  he succeeds here he will succeed in other countries. Two years before that George Soros bragged on
[52:52.140 --> 53:00.140]  the U.S. funding to overthrow the elected government, fire bomb the government buildings,
[53:00.140 --> 53:07.140]  kill thousands of police and start the civil war there. But I want to talk about real warfare,
[53:07.140 --> 53:12.140]  the real systems being used. You know, boots on the ground is the final phase of a takeover.
[53:12.140 --> 53:17.140]  But weather modification and mass starvation and poison shocks being given to our people
[53:17.140 --> 53:23.140]  and 5G and the cultural brainwashing and drag queen pedophile time, that's the real tip
[53:23.140 --> 53:27.140]  of the spear and it's not attacking the Russians, it's attacking them too. It's attacking us.
[53:27.140 --> 53:32.140]  We have an occupied, globalist government. We don't have an American government. We have
[53:32.140 --> 53:36.140]  a government that cuts off our oil drilling and cuts off our pipelines and opens our borders
[53:36.140 --> 53:40.140]  and ships in the fentanyl and does all the other things they've been doing and we're
[53:40.140 --> 53:46.140]  fed up with it and we're tired of it. Our war is with the new world order that's taken over.
[53:46.140 --> 53:52.140]  Russia is not expanding. Russia is encircled under attack. China, backed by the new world
[53:52.140 --> 53:58.140]  order, isn't building electric cars. They're building normal cars. We're being shut down.
[53:58.140 --> 54:03.140]  Dodd just came out and said they're not going to make himmy Hellcats anymore. They're going
[54:03.140 --> 54:08.140]  electric, which don't even work and are poisonous. It's incredible, ladies and gentlemen. We're
[54:08.140 --> 54:15.140]  under total and complete sabotage. Here's a powerful clip of Senator Herbert Cole questions
[54:15.140 --> 54:22.140]  Robert Fletcher on weather manipulation. This is 28 years ago in a Senate hearing and it's
[54:22.140 --> 54:27.140]  all real. It's all documented now. It's all going on like a backdrop, like the poison shots,
[54:27.140 --> 54:32.140]  any of it. We're not supposed to talk about it, but we are here. We are talking about it.
[54:32.140 --> 54:38.140]  We are discussing it. That's the real war. The open borders, the GMO, the poison shots,
[54:38.140 --> 54:41.140]  the weather modification. Here it is.
[54:41.140 --> 54:48.140]  Another question on the interview with the Los Angeles Times on April 21st. You said that
[54:48.140 --> 54:55.140]  you told the Associated Press that the American government has created weather tampering techniques
[54:55.140 --> 55:02.140]  so that the new world order will be able to starve millions of Americans and to control
[55:02.140 --> 55:06.140]  the rest. Would you explain what you were trying to say?
[55:06.140 --> 55:12.140]  Well, what I was trying to say is exactly what I said. There is weather control techniques.
[55:12.140 --> 55:16.140]  We have a complete package on that, which I did not bring, but I certainly will see
[55:16.140 --> 55:22.140]  to it that it is brought in for the record. Number one, the entire patents on the equipment.
[55:22.140 --> 55:27.140]  Number two, Senator Claiborne Pell's complete statement and story of his own that not only
[55:27.140 --> 55:32.140]  does it exist, but that we even utilize it as far back as the Vietnam War. You might want
[55:32.140 --> 55:36.140]  to touch base with Senator Pell. I just want to repeat before I turn it over.
[55:36.140 --> 55:40.140]  Yes, but we do have all that information. You're saying that the government has created
[55:40.140 --> 55:46.140]  weather tampering techniques so that the, quote, new world order will be able to starve
[55:46.140 --> 55:52.140]  millions of Americans. Worldwide. Millions of Americans and to control the rest.
[55:52.140 --> 55:58.140]  Yes, sir. And that's my belief. As bizarre as that sounds, when somebody had told me that
[55:58.140 --> 56:03.140]  equipment even existed 10 years ago, I would have thought they were nuts, sir. And at this
[56:03.140 --> 56:08.140]  point in time, we have all the documents to prove it. And if you think that 85 tornadoes
[56:08.140 --> 56:14.140]  takes place in the middle of our growing area by simultaneous accident, I'm sorry.
[56:14.140 --> 56:19.140]  Well, the equipment that's already set up internationally and as bizarre as that is,
[56:19.140 --> 56:24.140]  it is proven and documented. We will supply you with those documents. As bizarre as that
[56:24.140 --> 56:30.140]  is, I would say that weather wars, and this is a quoting actually Senator Claiborne Pell
[56:30.140 --> 56:35.140]  himself, that they are the greatest weapon ever created in the world. And that's the
[56:35.140 --> 56:38.140]  Senator's own statement. So yes, I had to do stand on that.
[56:38.140 --> 56:41.140]  Thank you, Mr. Fletcher. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[56:41.140 --> 56:48.140]  Anybody can type in Secretary of State William Cohen, 1998, admitting we have high-tech
[56:48.140 --> 56:53.140]  weather weapons. You can read the quote was in the Army Times. All right, folks, we're
[56:53.140 --> 56:56.140]  going to break. We've got a huge guest coming on, investigative journalist Steve Hirsch,
[56:56.140 --> 56:59.140]  confirming hundreds of thousands dead, conservative from the shot. You don't want to miss this

[58:50.140 --> 58:54.140]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want
[58:54.140 --> 58:59.140]  you to read that most of the big powerful companies trying to control your life, the
[58:59.140 --> 59:04.140]  big tech companies, they don't want you to read this book. They want to control what
[59:04.140 --> 59:09.140]  you think, what you do, what you read, but you don't want that. And Alex Jones doesn't
[59:09.140 --> 59:14.140]  want that. And this book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook
[59:14.140 --> 59:19.140]  for how to fight against it. And so by buying this book, you're going to prove that censorship
[59:19.140 --> 59:24.140]  doesn't work, that freedom is alive in this country. This is a central reading. And you
[59:24.140 --> 59:29.140]  know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in. It's not going to
[59:29.140 --> 59:33.140]  be available in bookstores. It's not going to be available in libraries. They're going
[59:33.140 --> 59:37.140]  to try to take it down from every platform that they can, but they're not going to be
[59:37.140 --> 59:42.140]  able to do it. Prove that censorship doesn't work. Buy the great reset. Thank you, Alex
[59:42.140 --> 59:47.140]  Jones. I really appreciate you having me on. And I appreciate you writing this book and
[59:47.140 --> 59:49.140]  getting the information out there.
[1:00:00.140 --> 1:00:06.140]  Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead, but I'm not
[1:00:06.140 --> 1:00:16.140]  concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And he's allowed me to go up
[1:00:16.140 --> 1:00:26.140]  to the mountain. And I've looked over and I've seen the promised land. I may not get
[1:00:26.140 --> 1:00:34.140]  that with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised
[1:00:34.140 --> 1:00:40.140]  land. We've got to come together. Whether you believe in that or not, you've got to
[1:00:40.140 --> 1:00:44.140]  decide whether you have dominion over yourself. I believe that the majority of the
[1:00:44.140 --> 1:00:49.140]  plain people of the United States will day in and day out make fewer mistakes in governing
[1:00:49.140 --> 1:00:54.140]  themselves than any smaller class or body of men, no matter what they're creating, will
[1:00:54.140 --> 1:00:58.140]  make in trying to govern them. And you've got to decide whether it's God that's going
[1:00:58.140 --> 1:01:03.140]  to have dominion over you that you get orders from or whether some other human that's
[1:01:03.140 --> 1:01:06.140]  jacked into the evil force is going to have dominion over you.
[1:01:06.140 --> 1:01:12.140]  What we're talking about now is like a second industrial revolution, but the product this
[1:01:12.140 --> 1:01:18.140]  time will not be textiles or machines or vehicles or even weapons. The product this
[1:01:18.140 --> 1:01:20.140]  time will be humans themselves.
[1:01:20.140 --> 1:01:25.140]  Do we want to have a human plan or a post human plan? Novol Harari and Klaus Schwab
[1:01:25.140 --> 1:01:29.140]  and Bill Gates say humans are obsolete. We're scum because they know we are their
[1:01:29.140 --> 1:01:34.140]  competition. They know that if we go for what we want and what God wants to have, they
[1:01:34.140 --> 1:01:38.140]  can't compete with that transmission. They can't compete with that blueprint. They
[1:01:38.140 --> 1:01:43.140]  can't compete without architecture. They can't compete with that master plan. But I
[1:01:43.140 --> 1:01:48.140]  just see it now. It'll be so clear soon. Are you pro human or are you anti human? You
[1:01:48.140 --> 1:01:53.140]  are the human resistance to this alien takeover. And again, when I say alien takeover, I
[1:01:53.140 --> 1:01:59.140]  don't mean some little tinfoil flying saucer crashing in Roswell from Alpha Centuries.
[1:01:59.140 --> 1:02:05.140]  I'm talking about the transmission in the universe of God's order and God's will or
[1:02:05.140 --> 1:02:11.140]  do you choose to serve the agents of death? And like Martin Luther King said, we're not
[1:02:11.140 --> 1:02:16.140]  going to judge them off what color they are. We're going to judge them off of the character
[1:02:16.140 --> 1:02:22.140]  of their actions and deeds. I'm going to say it right now real clear. I love everybody
[1:02:22.140 --> 1:02:27.140]  no matter what color your beautiful skin is, what I care about your heart and your guts
[1:02:27.140 --> 1:02:31.140]  and your mind. And you're under attack by these Satanists and they want to kill you
[1:02:31.140 --> 1:02:37.140]  and they want to kill your children. And I say we set our differences aside and I say
[1:02:37.140 --> 1:02:42.140]  we come together and we beat these people and we smash their technocracy and we build
[1:02:42.140 --> 1:02:47.140]  the future together and we can do anything with our real diversity. These enemies tell
[1:02:47.140 --> 1:02:52.140]  us all day about diversity. They mean divided and conquered groups of people separate from
[1:02:52.140 --> 1:02:59.140]  each other. This bill is supported by all of the Democrats, House and Senate. It's just
[1:02:59.140 --> 1:03:08.140]  the filibuster in a way. So in a way, if you really truly want to honor Dr. King, don't
[1:03:08.140 --> 1:03:15.140]  dishonor him by using a congressional custom as an excuse for protecting our democracy.
[1:03:15.140 --> 1:03:20.140]  But I tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're from Mayor Trump and you
[1:03:20.140 --> 1:03:29.140]  ain't black. I want unity under a code of freedom and liberty and justice and coming together
[1:03:29.140 --> 1:03:35.140]  and working together and being strong. And that's what Info Wars is and that's why the
[1:03:35.140 --> 1:03:43.140]  enemies of humanity hate us so much because we love God and God loves humanity. And I
[1:03:43.140 --> 1:03:53.140]  am a human supremacist. I am a human supremacist. I am a human supremacist. I am a human supremacist.
[1:03:53.140 --> 1:04:00.140]  I am a human supremacist. I am a human supremacist. That term will be the future war with the
[1:04:00.140 --> 1:04:05.140]  robots and the AI. What you're hearing now is the entire future and everything they
[1:04:05.140 --> 1:04:11.140]  tried to stop us from doing. Our supremacy will not end with this planet. We will keep
[1:04:11.140 --> 1:04:16.140]  the stars. We will colonize. We will green dead worlds. We will go interdimensional. We
[1:04:16.140 --> 1:04:20.140]  will unlock the secrets of the universe. God has laid them out like Christmas presents
[1:04:20.140 --> 1:04:25.140]  for his children. And I am extremely honored to be in the fulcrum and the heart of the
[1:04:25.140 --> 1:04:33.140]  fight to bring our race, the human race, in a race for the future. And we will break
[1:04:33.140 --> 1:04:38.140]  the enemy. We will break the pedophiles. We will break the Satanist because God already
[1:04:38.140 --> 1:04:45.140]  sent his own self down here to show us he could do it. God would never ask us to go through
[1:04:45.140 --> 1:04:49.140]  an obstacle course. He wouldn't go through. And now we're going to go through what Christ
[1:04:49.140 --> 1:04:54.140]  did. And we're going to go through it and we're going to be destroyed but reborn on the other
[1:04:54.140 --> 1:05:23.140]  side.
[1:05:24.140 --> 1:05:31.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, drum roll please of books in the world. The great reset in the war for
[1:05:31.140 --> 1:05:41.140]  the world is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. We are now number 9 in the world. This is major.
[1:05:41.140 --> 1:05:46.140]  This is political. This could fund our war chest. Just go to Amazon.com, everybody. And
[1:05:46.140 --> 1:05:52.140]  buy 10 copies. Send this blueprint to the Death Star and the New World Order. Because you
[1:05:52.140 --> 1:05:55.140]  know their whole plan how to stop them. Hit the great reset in the war for the world now.
[1:05:55.140 --> 1:06:00.140]  It's going to go to number 1. What are you making of that?
[1:06:00.140 --> 1:06:19.140]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report. It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:19.140 --> 1:06:23.140]  Well, philanthropist, executive director of COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund and also the
[1:06:23.140 --> 1:06:29.140]  Bastion Safety Research Foundation. Steve Kirsch is our guest. He's in Europe, so his internet's
[1:06:29.140 --> 1:06:34.140]  a little bit spotty. But man, he went on Tucker Carlson. All he had a fill-in guest and just
[1:06:34.140 --> 1:06:37.140]  knocked out of the park exposing the real numbers, the latest developments with these
[1:06:37.140 --> 1:06:43.140]  poison shots. Here's a clip of that and we'll go to him and get his response to Fauci putting
[1:06:43.140 --> 1:06:46.140]  on his resignation letter today. Here it is.
[1:06:46.140 --> 1:06:51.140]  Steve Kirsch is an entrepreneur. Self-made success story. Enjoy this now to explain his reasoning.
[1:06:51.140 --> 1:06:56.140]  Steve, when did the Democratic Party start going south with you?
[1:06:56.140 --> 1:07:04.140]  Well, when they violated my trust, Brian. You know, they told the agencies, the FDA, the CDC,
[1:07:04.140 --> 1:07:09.140]  the NIH said that these vaccines were safe and effective. And when I started seeing my
[1:07:09.140 --> 1:07:15.140]  friends die and be injured and I started looking at the data, there was no question that
[1:07:15.140 --> 1:07:21.140]  this vaccine is the most dangerous vaccine ever created by man. It is a thousand times
[1:07:21.140 --> 1:07:26.140]  more deadly than the smallpox vaccine, and that's too unsafe for people to use. And I could
[1:07:26.140 --> 1:07:32.140]  not get even a single minute in front of any Democratic congressman. The best I got was
[1:07:32.140 --> 1:07:39.140]  that Rokana gave me to a staff member who took two months to get back to me. And when I asked
[1:07:39.140 --> 1:07:44.140]  if she had read what I had sent her, she said, no, it disagreed with the CDC, so it's not
[1:07:44.140 --> 1:07:50.140]  right. And so I didn't really read it. And so that's as far as I ever got.
[1:07:50.140 --> 1:07:54.140]  But you didn't stop there. You did your own research. What did you find? What did you find
[1:07:54.140 --> 1:07:59.140]  was effective? And what was the reaction when you put it out there?
[1:07:59.140 --> 1:08:04.140]  Well, what I found was that hundreds of thousands of Americans have been killed by this
[1:08:04.140 --> 1:08:12.140]  vaccine and millions have been injured. And, you know, they're clearly, you are more likely
[1:08:12.140 --> 1:08:17.140]  to be injured or dead from the vaccine than if you were unvaccinated. So what they're
[1:08:17.140 --> 1:08:23.140]  saying, and what the reality is, is completely opposite. There's a conservative radio show
[1:08:23.140 --> 1:08:29.140]  commentator, his name is Wayne Root. He had a wedding eight months ago, and he had about
[1:08:29.140 --> 1:08:35.140]  half conservatives, and half of his, they're all pretty much conservatives, OK, but half
[1:08:35.140 --> 1:08:41.140]  were vaccinated and half were not vaccinated. And he found that of the hundred people that
[1:08:41.140 --> 1:08:48.140]  were vaccinated, he had 26 people who were seriously injured, and he had seven people
[1:08:48.140 --> 1:08:52.140]  who died. And in the unvaccinated group, he had zero and zero.
[1:08:52.140 --> 1:08:53.140]  So Steve, yeah, we don't know.
[1:08:53.140 --> 1:08:56.140]  That is statistically impossible if the vaccines are safe.
[1:08:56.140 --> 1:09:00.140]  Right. So we can't verify those numbers. These are the numbers that you have. But in
[1:09:00.140 --> 1:09:09.140]  turn, the Democrats who you funded exceedingly, can't even return.
[1:09:09.140 --> 1:09:13.140]  Here we are. Steve Kerr joins us for the balance of the hour. But we do have numbers. We have
[1:09:13.140 --> 1:09:17.140]  insurance company numbers. We have government numbers. We have them all. He has them all
[1:09:17.140 --> 1:09:21.140]  in a substack. He's going to lay out the facts that now even the CDC saying, OK, the
[1:09:21.140 --> 1:09:26.140]  shot doesn't help. He doesn't protect you all over the world from Australia to Germany
[1:09:26.140 --> 1:09:30.140]  to the UK, to Canada, to the U.S. They're showing that people that have been injected
[1:09:30.140 --> 1:09:34.140]  are way more likely to actually get sick. So they're lying that, well, it doesn't give
[1:09:34.140 --> 1:09:39.140]  me full protection when it makes it less severe. Steve Kerr, great job exposing all this.
[1:09:39.140 --> 1:09:42.140]  You've been putting this out for a while, but now the numbers have become crystal clear.
[1:09:42.140 --> 1:09:47.140]  Thanks for joining us. Lay it out for us.
[1:09:47.140 --> 1:09:54.140]  Well, it's just like I said on Fox News. And, you know, Brian, who was the host, was caught
[1:09:54.140 --> 1:09:59.140]  off guard. And so he said, well, we can't verify those numbers. Well, he was actually
[1:09:59.140 --> 1:10:06.140]  telling people the truth because Fox News has contractual commitments that don't allow them
[1:10:06.140 --> 1:10:13.140]  to speak poorly about the vaccine. So they can't say anything anti-vax on Fox News. And
[1:10:13.140 --> 1:10:18.140]  so they can't verify my numbers because if they did, they would have to be admitting
[1:10:18.140 --> 1:10:23.140]  that the vaccines are not safe and not effective. And that's a whole other scandal that's admitted,
[1:10:23.140 --> 1:10:26.140]  but nobody talks about it. Explain to people that a whole bunch of media outlets got bought
[1:10:26.140 --> 1:10:31.140]  off of the contracts with Pfizer two years ago.
[1:10:31.140 --> 1:10:38.140]  Yeah. Well, we know that the White House has spent a billion dollars on influencing media
[1:10:38.140 --> 1:10:45.140]  and giving money to media to promote these vaccines. And the drug companies, we don't
[1:10:45.140 --> 1:10:51.140]  know what the contracts say, but it's pretty clear that there was no interest at Fox in
[1:10:51.140 --> 1:10:57.140]  validating the numbers. Now, if what I said is true, if we really have killed hundreds
[1:10:57.140 --> 1:11:02.140]  of thousands of people, you would think that Fox News would be interested in covering that
[1:11:02.140 --> 1:11:10.140]  and looking at my data. So after the interview, I talked to the producer and I said, hey,
[1:11:10.140 --> 1:11:17.140]  would you like to see the data? And there was no response. They don't want to see the
[1:11:17.140 --> 1:11:26.140]  data, but Naomi Wolf. So it's sort of the wolf is guarding the Fox House now. And Naomi
[1:11:26.140 --> 1:11:34.140]  Wolf went on her subset and she validated my numbers, but she didn't use any of the data
[1:11:34.140 --> 1:11:40.140]  that I supplied to her. She chose to use her own independent sources to see if she could
[1:11:40.140 --> 1:11:47.140]  verify what I said. And she found that what I said was true, both in hundreds of thousands
[1:11:47.140 --> 1:11:54.140]  of people being killed and millions of people being vaccine injured. Now, nobody else has
[1:11:54.140 --> 1:12:00.140]  even bothered to do this. So nobody else has contacted me for the data. No fact checker
[1:12:00.140 --> 1:12:07.140]  in the entire world will ask me for the data so that they could verify it and have a discussion
[1:12:07.140 --> 1:12:13.140]  with me that is recorded so that everybody can hear the discussion. So if they have any
[1:12:13.140 --> 1:12:20.140]  reservations at all, let's talk about it on a recorded video so that there is no question
[1:12:20.140 --> 1:12:26.140]  as to what was said and what the responses were because people will always have questions.
[1:12:26.140 --> 1:12:32.140]  We want to make sure that that is transparent and in front of the American people. Now,
[1:12:32.140 --> 1:12:41.140]  no fact checker has volunteered to check my data. No fact checker has asked for my data.
[1:12:41.140 --> 1:12:47.140]  And, you know, so people are basically ignoring this, which is the only thing that they can
[1:12:47.140 --> 1:12:54.140]  do is to ignore this and hope that it goes away because everything I said is verifiable.
[1:12:54.140 --> 1:13:00.140]  And what's more important is that people can verify it themselves. So for example, I went
[1:13:00.140 --> 1:13:06.140]  on Nextdoor. Now, Nextdoor is not very friendly to people like me who are counter narrative.
[1:13:06.140 --> 1:13:13.140]  And so my poll was up for one before Nextdoor took it down. But before they took it down,
[1:13:13.140 --> 1:13:20.140]  it showed that there were more deaths from the vaccine than from COVID. And that of course
[1:13:20.140 --> 1:13:26.140]  is why they took it down because the data wasn't working in their favor. So they took it down
[1:13:26.140 --> 1:13:33.140]  as misinformation, even though it was a valid survey. Now, on Nextdoor, most of the people
[1:13:33.140 --> 1:13:39.140]  on Nextdoor are all pro-vax people. You know, they're completely blue-pilled. They're
[1:13:39.140 --> 1:13:44.140]  swallowing the narrative. And people like me who say that people are being killed, they,
[1:13:44.140 --> 1:13:55.140]  people like me are ostracized. So it is absolutely stunning when even on a Nextdoor survey that
[1:13:55.140 --> 1:14:02.140]  you find that more people reported vaccine deaths. I mean, just don't even exist on
[1:14:02.140 --> 1:14:07.140]  Nextdoor. There are more vaccine deaths than there were COVID deaths. And of course, every
[1:14:07.140 --> 1:14:15.140]  survey I do, I always find that there are more deaths from people who are given remdesivir
[1:14:15.140 --> 1:14:22.140]  and being with and had their ivermectin and other drugs that work withheld. And so what's
[1:14:22.140 --> 1:14:29.140]  really killing people is the hospital protocols for COVID and not COVID itself. I mean, if
[1:14:29.140 --> 1:14:34.140]  it was just COVID itself, you know, and people were told to treat it with ivermectin and
[1:14:34.140 --> 1:14:41.140]  hydroxychloroquine and fluvoxamine and vitamin D and a bunch of other drugs that are proven
[1:14:41.140 --> 1:14:46.140]  to be safe and effective, there would be no pandemic. I mean, we can really stop this
[1:14:46.140 --> 1:14:52.140]  pandemic anytime we want, just with the snap of our fingers. All they have to do is one
[1:14:52.140 --> 1:14:58.140]  thing, do differently, which is to stop listening to the people that they're listening to now,
[1:14:58.140 --> 1:15:02.140]  and they should start listening to the people that they're censoring.
[1:15:02.140 --> 1:15:07.140]  I totally agree, Steve Gersh, I want to talk with Big Fisher. We have insurance companies,
[1:15:07.140 --> 1:15:11.140]  we have government numbers, we have New Zealand news reports admitting that it's the vaccinated
[1:15:11.140 --> 1:15:16.140]  that are super sick, and now record numbers of death, coroners are reporting, pathologists
[1:15:16.140 --> 1:15:21.140]  are reporting. I mean, you go off of the hardcore numbers, you've been saying this for a couple
[1:15:21.140 --> 1:15:26.140]  of years now, now it's all confirmed, now you have a main line, people like DeSantis
[1:15:26.140 --> 1:15:30.140]  coming out saying the vaccine doesn't work. It looks to me like, we're coming back for
[1:15:30.140 --> 1:15:34.140]  a break and talk about this, but the wheels are coming off, the whole thing is collapsing
[1:15:34.140 --> 1:15:37.140]  and it's fair to say that. I want to get your view of that's right and where you see this
[1:15:37.140 --> 1:15:43.140]  going now, because you've got Fauci resigning, so much more, Steve Gersh, SteveGersh.substack.com
[1:15:43.140 --> 1:15:49.140]  on Twitter, and ST Gersh, and GAB, ST Gersh, stay with us, we'll be right back with this
[1:15:49.140 --> 1:15:52.140]  man that's done probably more than anybody out there when it comes to actual statistics,
[1:15:52.140 --> 1:15:54.140]  laying it out, please stay with us.
[1:15:59.140 --> 1:16:03.140]  It feels to Alex Jones crazy, he's a conspiracy theory guy, he's a nutcase, he's got these
[1:16:03.140 --> 1:16:10.140]  rants and all that. What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many
[1:16:10.140 --> 1:16:16.140]  different topics of signal, not noise. If you look at the signal, and you compare that
[1:16:16.140 --> 1:16:22.140]  to PBS and NPR and BBC, and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there, versus what your
[1:16:22.140 --> 1:16:27.140]  collective body has put out there, and if you're setting a human being and just watching
[1:16:27.140 --> 1:16:30.140]  it, you say, well, Alex Jones is ahead of this, not only that, you can't have explained
[1:16:30.140 --> 1:16:35.140]  it, you are one of the great thinkers of this. That is very rare, you've got to go back
[1:16:35.140 --> 1:16:40.140]  almost to the revolutionary generation and see that. In this new book, I've got to tell
[1:16:40.140 --> 1:16:44.140]  you, when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this thing, I go, this is it, this
[1:16:44.140 --> 1:16:48.140]  is no Beatrix, you're not going to be flipping pages, you're going to be having a pin out
[1:16:48.140 --> 1:17:11.140]  and you're going to be underlying stuff.
[1:17:11.140 --> 1:17:18.140]  Don't panic. Stay calm, because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer
[1:17:18.140 --> 1:17:24.140]  the ship onto a safe sound course. There is nothing stopping we, the people, from making
[1:17:24.140 --> 1:17:30.140]  our own rules and building our own society. All we've got to do is survive the crash,
[1:17:30.140 --> 1:17:36.140]  and right now, we still have time to prepare. The world fiat currency system is racing
[1:17:36.140 --> 1:17:42.140]  at zero. It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water and survival
[1:17:42.140 --> 1:17:49.140]  gear to keep us strong and at the ready. Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials,
[1:17:49.140 --> 1:17:58.140]  storable foods, water filtration, first aid, power and more at preparedtoday.com.
[1:17:58.140 --> 1:18:04.140]  Alex Jones expanded his broadcast by selling a line of products focused on healing from
[1:18:04.140 --> 1:18:10.140]  the toxic world of a corrupt system, which has allowed Infowars to remain a free public
[1:18:10.140 --> 1:18:15.140]  broadcast to combat the dangerous lies of the mainstream media.
[1:18:15.140 --> 1:18:22.140]  Alex Jones is patient zero for alternative facts.
[1:18:22.140 --> 1:18:25.140]  Do you understand what I have said?
[1:18:25.140 --> 1:18:28.140]  Yes, I believe what I said was true.
[1:18:28.140 --> 1:18:33.140]  Yes, you believe everything you say is true, but it isn't. Your beliefs do not make something
[1:18:33.140 --> 1:18:37.140]  true. That is what we're doing here.
[1:18:37.140 --> 1:18:42.140]  There's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse
[1:18:42.140 --> 1:18:44.140]  of Infowars in the bankruptcy estate.
[1:18:44.140 --> 1:18:50.140]  The Infowars audience has mobilized and awakened the world to the threat that is globalism,
[1:18:50.140 --> 1:18:57.140]  and with your continued support, we will keep going. Join us now and support the Infowar.
[1:18:57.140 --> 1:19:05.140]  The number one selling category in supplements worldwide is fat burners, is weight loss formulas.
[1:19:05.140 --> 1:19:12.140]  And listen, there are hundreds of them out there that work, but most of them do it in a toxic way.
[1:19:12.140 --> 1:19:17.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, we went out and did deep research on the safest, healthiest ways to
[1:19:17.140 --> 1:19:25.140]  take your overall body's metabolic system and your metabolism and turn that clock back
[1:19:25.140 --> 1:19:28.140]  turning up your metabolism.
[1:19:28.140 --> 1:19:32.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, Diet Force does it in a clean, healthy way. It's amazing.
[1:19:32.140 --> 1:19:37.140]  I've almost lost 40 pounds the last three months just using the samples of it, but now
[1:19:37.140 --> 1:19:42.140]  it's come into the Infowar store and is ready for sale to you and your family exclusively
[1:19:42.140 --> 1:19:44.140]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:44.140 --> 1:19:51.140]  Diet Force from X7 exclusively available at Infowarsstore.com for 40% off.
[1:19:51.140 --> 1:19:56.140]  I want you to experience Diet Force for yourself. I can't wait for the reviews because it's worked great for me.
[1:20:26.140 --> 1:20:31.140]  He's already had Congress and federal agencies tell him to save all his records.
[1:20:31.140 --> 1:20:35.140]  He ran the gain of function project calling it that.
[1:20:35.140 --> 1:20:40.140]  They said that they would blow up the old system of approval with a virus out of China.
[1:20:40.140 --> 1:20:46.140]  They said that three and a half years ago, about six, eight, nine months before the virus got released.
[1:20:46.140 --> 1:20:53.140]  Now, here we are, big picture with Steve Kirsch, investigative journalist, entrepreneur, engineer,
[1:20:53.140 --> 1:20:57.140]  breaking all this down, SteveKirsch.substack.com.
[1:20:57.140 --> 1:21:01.140]  I want to get into the numbers and what the media doesn't want you to show, but our listeners have seen them.
[1:21:01.140 --> 1:21:03.140]  They understand that and more and more is coming out.
[1:21:03.140 --> 1:21:05.140]  It's all over the news.
[1:21:05.140 --> 1:21:12.140]  Why is the former head of the CDC and the current head of the CDC and the head of Trump's task force, Berks,
[1:21:12.140 --> 1:21:17.140]  all of them coming on saying, we knew it wouldn't work. That's a quote, obviously by Berks.
[1:21:17.140 --> 1:21:20.140]  And what are they doing and what would you call this moment?
[1:21:20.140 --> 1:21:23.140]  Because for me, looking at it, it looks like they're scared.
[1:21:23.140 --> 1:21:25.140]  They know it's all coming out.
[1:21:25.140 --> 1:21:27.140]  Suddenly almost no one's taking it.
[1:21:27.140 --> 1:21:30.140]  Six percent of five-year-olds and up have taken the shot.
[1:21:30.140 --> 1:21:33.140]  Almost no one's giving it to six-month-olds.
[1:21:33.140 --> 1:21:34.140]  Thank God.
[1:21:34.140 --> 1:21:39.140]  So even their own leftists now are waking up and I just look at Twitter, Facebook, everywhere I've been looking.
[1:21:39.140 --> 1:21:42.140]  It's just everywhere people are saying, I'm paralyzed.
[1:21:42.140 --> 1:21:43.140]  My mom's dead.
[1:21:43.140 --> 1:21:44.140]  My kids paralyzed.
[1:21:44.140 --> 1:21:45.140]  I died.
[1:21:45.140 --> 1:21:46.140]  My husband died.
[1:21:46.140 --> 1:21:52.140]  I mean, what in the world did Bill Gates and Peter Dazik and Anthony Fauci do?
[1:21:52.140 --> 1:21:54.140]  That's a, where are we right now?
[1:21:54.140 --> 1:21:55.140]  This is a shorter segment.
[1:21:55.140 --> 1:21:56.140]  The next segment coming up.
[1:21:56.140 --> 1:22:03.140]  I don't think Trump's a bad guy, but Trump be damned if this all comes out and he keeps pushing the shot.
[1:22:03.140 --> 1:22:04.140]  I'm glad to say this isn't.
[1:22:04.140 --> 1:22:06.140]  I've made a lot of headlines being very critical.
[1:22:06.140 --> 1:22:09.140]  Trump will get kids come first, not political alliances.
[1:22:09.140 --> 1:22:10.140]  So that's a lot I threw out there.
[1:22:10.140 --> 1:22:14.140]  Steve Kerr, tackle it however you want.
[1:22:14.140 --> 1:22:20.140]  Well, you know, I think there's going to be a lot of finger pointing here.
[1:22:20.140 --> 1:22:23.140]  Like, I didn't know it was not my fault.
[1:22:23.140 --> 1:22:24.140]  I did the right thing.
[1:22:24.140 --> 1:22:26.140]  I had no idea.
[1:22:26.140 --> 1:22:28.140]  That's what usually happens.
[1:22:28.140 --> 1:22:33.140]  We're seeing some of this in other countries as things break.
[1:22:33.140 --> 1:22:37.140]  So I think the thing is collapsing.
[1:22:37.140 --> 1:22:41.140]  We, you know, we're called the wheels falling off the bus.
[1:22:41.140 --> 1:22:45.140]  And there's a good article that's, it's the pinned article on my sub stack.
[1:22:45.140 --> 1:22:53.140]  And it talks about, it goes through a hundred things that are things that are in front of people that can't be ignored.
[1:22:53.140 --> 1:22:59.140]  All of these, like the sudden adult death syndrome, like we haven't had that before as being a problem.
[1:22:59.140 --> 1:23:01.140]  And now it's happening all the time.
[1:23:01.140 --> 1:23:04.140]  We're seeing the young kids that are dying.
[1:23:04.140 --> 1:23:11.140]  We're seeing two and three year olds with, with, who are having seizures.
[1:23:11.140 --> 1:23:15.140]  And these are not febrile seizures that doctors are familiar with.
[1:23:15.140 --> 1:23:17.140]  There's no fever involved in these.
[1:23:17.140 --> 1:23:19.140]  These are happening after vaccination.
[1:23:19.140 --> 1:23:21.140]  So there, there are things.
[1:23:21.140 --> 1:23:29.140]  There's, there is someone who brought me in from a, from a hospital saying that when they first went to the hospital,
[1:23:29.140 --> 1:23:36.140]  they would rarely hear these stroke, stroke alerts in the hospital.
[1:23:36.140 --> 1:23:45.140]  And then it became like every two hours in the hospital after the vaccines were being rolled out to younger and younger people.
[1:23:45.140 --> 1:23:56.140]  Oh, it's pretty obvious to people that are paying attention that things are going very wrong and blaming it on the unvaccinated.
[1:23:56.140 --> 1:24:04.140]  But you see the hospitals, the people that work at the hospitals are telling me that you're vaccinated and you check into a hospital.
[1:24:04.140 --> 1:24:07.140]  They don't record your vaccination status.
[1:24:07.140 --> 1:24:09.140]  So you'll look like unvaccinated.
[1:24:09.140 --> 1:24:15.140]  So all of these, these cardiac events and so forth are happening to be unvaccinated.
[1:24:15.140 --> 1:24:17.140]  And Steve, what's talking about that?
[1:24:17.140 --> 1:24:18.140]  In fact, the vaccinated.
[1:24:18.140 --> 1:24:20.140]  It's not just all the sports people that are dying.
[1:24:20.140 --> 1:24:22.140]  It's not just you warning of this.
[1:24:22.140 --> 1:24:24.140]  Suddenly I see articles everywhere all over the world.
[1:24:24.140 --> 1:24:26.140]  It's normal to have heart attacks.
[1:24:26.140 --> 1:24:28.140]  Young people, it's normal for five year olds to have heart attacks.
[1:24:28.140 --> 1:24:29.140]  Yeah.
[1:24:29.140 --> 1:24:33.140]  Suddenly, uh, microcarditis is off the charts from Australia to the US.
[1:24:33.140 --> 1:24:34.140]  I mean, it's here.
[1:24:34.140 --> 1:24:37.140]  They did it.
[1:24:37.140 --> 1:24:38.140]  Yeah.
[1:24:38.140 --> 1:24:42.140]  You know, it's, it's hard to ignore, but they're saying that we don't know the cause.
[1:24:42.140 --> 1:24:47.140]  You know, oh, this is just really strange that this is happening and we'll look into it.
[1:24:47.140 --> 1:24:49.140]  But this is the greatest killer of all time.
[1:24:49.140 --> 1:24:51.140]  This is really, there's stuff.
[1:24:51.140 --> 1:24:53.140]  This is unprecedented.
[1:24:53.140 --> 1:24:55.140]  The numbers here are so large.
[1:24:55.140 --> 1:25:00.140]  This is greater than this killing people at a rate that's much higher than heart diseases.
[1:25:00.140 --> 1:25:02.140]  So it's the new number one killer.
[1:25:02.140 --> 1:25:09.140]  And yet the CDC is silent on all of this and they don't want to be put on camera.
[1:25:09.140 --> 1:25:11.140]  They want to go on the record.
[1:25:11.140 --> 1:25:12.140]  They don't want to challenge us.
[1:25:12.140 --> 1:25:19.140]  You know, there's, there's someone at Carol Crawford, who is the person at the CDC who's responsible for
[1:25:19.140 --> 1:25:22.140]  quashing the misinformation spreaders.
[1:25:22.140 --> 1:25:25.140]  And so she coordinates with the social media platforms.
[1:25:25.140 --> 1:25:30.140]  So I wrote her, I said, Carol, hey, you know, we, we got, I got a deal for you.
[1:25:30.140 --> 1:25:35.140]  You know, I'll get all the misinformation spreaders in a room and you can take them all down.
[1:25:35.140 --> 1:25:40.140]  And let's just go through like your 20 hot topics and we'll go through our 20 hot topics.
[1:25:40.140 --> 1:25:43.140]  We'll just have a nice civil discussion.
[1:25:43.140 --> 1:25:49.140]  She's not interested in that, which tells me she's not interested in stopping the misinformation spreading because
[1:25:49.140 --> 1:25:53.140]  she knows damn well that we're not talking misinformation here.
[1:25:53.140 --> 1:25:58.140]  It would be exposed for them to, to go on camera.
[1:25:58.140 --> 1:26:03.140]  This is why we're being ignored by the FDA, the CDC, the NIH.
[1:26:03.140 --> 1:26:07.140]  None of these people will go on camera with any of us.
[1:26:07.140 --> 1:26:08.140]  It's not just me.
[1:26:08.140 --> 1:26:11.140]  They'll make excuses as to why they don't want to go on with me.
[1:26:11.140 --> 1:26:13.140]  They'll say, oh, I'm not a doctor.
[1:26:13.140 --> 1:26:17.140]  But you see, when I offer the doctors, they don't want to talk to them either.
[1:26:17.140 --> 1:26:22.140]  And so they just don't want to talk about it at all.
[1:26:22.140 --> 1:26:27.140]  And mainstream media isn't asking them any of the tough questions here.
[1:26:27.140 --> 1:26:29.140]  Like somebody dies.
[1:26:29.140 --> 1:26:35.140]  They ask what that person vaccinated and when was that person vaccinated.
[1:26:35.140 --> 1:26:38.140]  That just never gets covered in a story.
[1:26:38.140 --> 1:26:41.140]  And we see people in plain sight.
[1:26:41.140 --> 1:26:44.140]  I mean, I saw an Arab ambassador.
[1:26:44.140 --> 1:26:48.140]  He's speaking at a podium and he just drops dead.
[1:26:48.140 --> 1:26:54.140]  But we've seen that over and over and over again after the vaccines rolled out and
[1:26:54.140 --> 1:26:58.140]  nobody is putting two and two together because they just don't want to know.
[1:26:58.140 --> 1:26:59.140]  Well, that's right.
[1:26:59.140 --> 1:27:00.140]  Steve, stop right there.
[1:27:00.140 --> 1:27:02.140]  I mean, you've been talking about this for years, warning of it.
[1:27:02.140 --> 1:27:03.140]  Now it's happened.
[1:27:03.140 --> 1:27:06.140]  The CDC in October of 2000 predicted exactly this happening.
[1:27:06.140 --> 1:27:10.140]  Michael Yedon, the former chief scientist at Pfizer, who, you know, just quit a year
[1:27:10.140 --> 1:27:12.140]  before he came out and predicted it all.
[1:27:12.140 --> 1:27:14.140]  They tried to follow emergency injunctions to the EU.
[1:27:14.140 --> 1:27:15.140]  They knew.
[1:27:15.140 --> 1:27:18.140]  So clearly they, this is like a test.
[1:27:18.140 --> 1:27:21.140]  It's all like, oh, they killed a bunch of people and maimed a bunch.
[1:27:21.140 --> 1:27:22.140]  They didn't know.
[1:27:22.140 --> 1:27:23.140]  Now they're covering it up.
[1:27:23.140 --> 1:27:24.140]  They knew.
[1:27:24.140 --> 1:27:28.140]  Why would they try something so incredibly bold?
[1:27:28.140 --> 1:27:33.140]  Well, I think that they were drinking the Kool-Aid from Tony Fauci.
[1:27:33.140 --> 1:27:39.140]  So, you know, first of all, Tony is the guy who funded the creation of SARS-CoV-2.
[1:27:39.140 --> 1:27:42.140]  If it wasn't for Tony, we wouldn't have a pandemic.
[1:27:42.140 --> 1:27:49.140]  And isn't it interesting, Alex, that right after we got the genomic sequence, within
[1:27:49.140 --> 1:27:56.140]  two days after the genomic sequence for SARS-CoV-2 virus was known, within two days, Moderna
[1:27:56.140 --> 1:27:59.140]  said we have a vaccine candidate that we can use.
[1:27:59.140 --> 1:28:04.140]  Now, isn't that amazing that they could do that in just two days when it's taken them
[1:28:04.140 --> 1:28:11.140]  like six months to get a vaccine against one of the variants?
[1:28:11.140 --> 1:28:16.140]  Now, how could they do it so quickly for a coronavirus?
[1:28:16.140 --> 1:28:19.140]  They weren't kind of in on it beforehand.
[1:28:19.140 --> 1:28:24.140]  And why is this 19 nucleotides, which is highly unusual.
[1:28:24.140 --> 1:28:27.140]  It does happen in nature, but it never happens in a virus.
[1:28:27.140 --> 1:28:35.140]  It's in a Moderna patent and now it shows up in a coronavirus, a beta coronavirus out
[1:28:35.140 --> 1:28:37.140]  of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[1:28:37.140 --> 1:28:38.140]  Steve Kirsch, stay there.
[1:28:38.140 --> 1:28:39.140]  Stay there.
[1:28:39.140 --> 1:28:40.140]  This is so critical.
[1:28:40.140 --> 1:28:42.140]  You've got so much knowledge.
[1:28:42.140 --> 1:28:43.140]  I want to get into the data.
[1:28:43.140 --> 1:28:45.140]  They don't want to see the insurance company data.
[1:28:45.140 --> 1:28:47.140]  What it means Fauci is resigning and so much more.
[1:28:47.140 --> 1:28:50.140]  Everybody's got to go to Steve Kirsch's sub stack.
[1:28:50.140 --> 1:28:52.140]  It is one of the most important things in the world.
[1:28:52.140 --> 1:28:59.140]  SteveKirsch.substack.com, go there now.
[1:28:59.140 --> 1:29:00.140]  People say Alex Jones is crazy.
[1:29:00.140 --> 1:29:02.140]  He's a conspiracy theory guy.
[1:29:02.140 --> 1:29:03.140]  He's a nutcase.
[1:29:03.140 --> 1:29:05.140]  He's got these rants and all that.
[1:29:05.140 --> 1:29:12.140]  What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal,
[1:29:12.140 --> 1:29:13.140]  not noise.
[1:29:13.140 --> 1:29:20.140]  If you look at the signal and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC and we'll do what Alex
[1:29:20.140 --> 1:29:24.140]  Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there.
[1:29:24.140 --> 1:29:29.140]  And if you're a human being and just watching it, you say, well, Alex Jones is ahead of
[1:29:29.140 --> 1:29:30.140]  this.
[1:29:30.140 --> 1:29:31.140]  Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[1:29:31.140 --> 1:29:33.140]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[1:29:33.140 --> 1:29:34.140]  That is very rare.
[1:29:34.140 --> 1:29:38.140]  You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[1:29:38.140 --> 1:29:42.140]  In this new book, I've got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this
[1:29:42.140 --> 1:29:43.140]  thing.
[1:29:43.140 --> 1:29:44.140]  I go, this is it.
[1:29:44.140 --> 1:29:45.140]  This is no Beatrix.
[1:29:45.140 --> 1:29:47.140]  You're not going to be flipping pages here.
[1:29:47.140 --> 1:29:48.140]  You're going to be having a pin out.
[1:29:48.140 --> 1:29:49.140]  You're going to be underlying stuff.
[1:29:49.140 --> 1:29:52.140]  The Great Reset by Alex Jones.

[1:30:58.140 --> 1:31:03.140]  So many people over the years have walked up to me randomly on the street and said,
[1:31:03.140 --> 1:31:06.140]  Super male vitality is incredible.
[1:31:06.140 --> 1:31:08.140]  Why does it work so well?
[1:31:08.140 --> 1:31:09.140]  And the answer is very simple.
[1:31:09.140 --> 1:31:15.140]  It takes from Chinese medicine and other ancient traditions, known herbal compounds that boost
[1:31:15.140 --> 1:31:17.140]  libido, stamina and energy.
[1:31:17.140 --> 1:31:20.140]  And it comes from cold pressed herbs.
[1:31:20.140 --> 1:31:26.140]  So they're not boiling or heating up the herbs that are known to have these natural effects.
[1:31:26.140 --> 1:31:28.140]  It's cold pressed.
[1:31:28.140 --> 1:31:31.140]  It's been sold out for eight months or more.
[1:31:31.140 --> 1:31:38.140]  It's finally back in stock at infowarstore.com for 25% off Super male vitality.

[1:31:58.140 --> 1:32:03.140]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher,
[1:32:03.140 --> 1:32:08.140]  a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[1:32:08.140 --> 1:32:09.140]  You see it every year.
[1:32:09.140 --> 1:32:11.140]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[1:32:11.140 --> 1:32:14.140]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[1:32:14.140 --> 1:32:20.140]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[1:32:20.140 --> 1:32:24.140]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this.
[1:32:24.140 --> 1:32:30.140]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[1:32:30.140 --> 1:32:36.140]  To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.
[1:32:36.140 --> 1:32:41.140]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[1:32:41.140 --> 1:32:46.140]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com.
[1:32:46.140 --> 1:32:51.140]  One word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-900-4285.
[1:32:51.140 --> 1:33:01.140]  833-900-4285.
[1:33:23.140 --> 1:33:25.140]  I believe in humanity.
[1:33:25.140 --> 1:33:28.140]  I believe we can take on the globalist.
[1:33:28.140 --> 1:33:32.140]  I believe in independent journalists and doctors and scientists and you.
[1:33:32.140 --> 1:33:35.140]  And now we've got a real fighting chance.
[1:33:35.140 --> 1:33:38.140]  Thanks to you defending independent media like this operation.
[1:33:38.140 --> 1:33:41.140]  Please spread the word with this live show.
[1:33:41.140 --> 1:33:43.140]  Share the archive once it's at man.video.
[1:33:43.140 --> 1:33:45.140]  This is life-saving.
[1:33:45.140 --> 1:33:46.140]  The enemy's falling apart.
[1:33:46.140 --> 1:33:47.140]  Fauci's resigned.
[1:33:47.140 --> 1:33:49.140]  It's all coming out that the vaccine didn't work.
[1:33:49.140 --> 1:33:51.140]  It's coming out it's killing people.
[1:33:51.140 --> 1:33:54.140]  But now we've got to save the children they're coming after.
[1:33:54.140 --> 1:33:57.140]  That's why I told Trump he's got to do like the Santas and say I was conned.
[1:33:57.140 --> 1:34:03.140]  I was lied to like Bolsonaro and decouple himself or he becomes a person aiding this.
[1:34:03.140 --> 1:34:05.140]  Sure, I've been a libertarian Republican.
[1:34:05.140 --> 1:34:06.140]  I agree with a lot of stuff.
[1:34:06.140 --> 1:34:08.140]  Democrats used to agree with anti-war and stuff.
[1:34:08.140 --> 1:34:11.140]  But I don't support Republicans of their pro-death shot.
[1:34:11.140 --> 1:34:16.140]  Just like Steve Kerch has been a big Democrat, big fundraiser, big successful tech company owner.
[1:34:16.140 --> 1:34:17.140]  He's broken with them.
[1:34:17.140 --> 1:34:20.140]  I mean, we just have to say politics does not exist.
[1:34:20.140 --> 1:34:22.140]  D's and R's do not matter.
[1:34:22.140 --> 1:34:24.140]  C's matter, meaning children.
[1:34:24.140 --> 1:34:26.140]  And the F matters, meaning our future.
[1:34:26.140 --> 1:34:28.140]  So please go to infowarstore.com.
[1:34:28.140 --> 1:34:30.140]  We've got great products like vitamin refusion.

[1:34:39.140 --> 1:34:44.140]  I got to stop it the next few days for a fundraiser for the new book that starts shipping out next week.
[1:34:44.140 --> 1:34:46.140]  The great reset in the war for the world.
[1:34:46.140 --> 1:34:48.140]  Sign copies, infowarstore.com.
[1:34:48.140 --> 1:34:54.140]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on air despite all the attacks and the show trials and the rest of it.
[1:34:54.140 --> 1:34:57.140]  Because our most important work is happening now.
[1:34:57.140 --> 1:34:59.140]  And every success we have is due to you.
[1:34:59.140 --> 1:35:01.140]  And I think and salute you all.
[1:35:01.140 --> 1:35:07.140]  Steve Kerch continuing with the wheels coming off this and Fauci resigning and my question about Trump and the rest of it.
[1:35:07.140 --> 1:35:09.140]  What do we need to do?
[1:35:09.140 --> 1:35:11.140]  What do you think Trump should do?
[1:35:11.140 --> 1:35:12.140]  What can the average person do?
[1:35:12.140 --> 1:35:20.140]  And then also if you want to go back into the numbers and the facts from the coroners and the undertakers and the hospitals and the insurance companies.
[1:35:20.140 --> 1:35:25.140]  I mean, this is just incredible.
[1:35:25.140 --> 1:35:30.140]  Yeah, you know, Alex, all the numbers are consistent.
[1:35:30.140 --> 1:35:36.140]  You know, we can look at the death tolls and the injury tolls 10 different ways and we'll get the same results.
[1:35:36.140 --> 1:35:44.140]  And, you know, if I were Trump, right now, Trump is treating this vaccine injuries and deaths as a third rail.
[1:35:44.140 --> 1:35:49.140]  And so he doesn't even want to go near it at all.
[1:35:49.140 --> 1:35:50.140]  He doesn't want to touch it.
[1:35:50.140 --> 1:35:53.140]  Doesn't want to take any questions on it.
[1:35:53.140 --> 1:35:55.140]  Simply wants to avoid it.
[1:35:55.140 --> 1:35:57.140]  That's not the right approach.
[1:35:57.140 --> 1:35:58.140]  I think try.
[1:35:58.140 --> 1:35:59.140]  I think you're right.
[1:35:59.140 --> 1:36:03.140]  The Trump's best approach is to say, hey, I was con.
[1:36:03.140 --> 1:36:06.140]  I now know the truth.
[1:36:06.140 --> 1:36:16.140]  And the sooner he comes out saying the same thing that I've been saying, and I'm happy to supply him with any of the data on this.
[1:36:16.140 --> 1:36:27.140]  But as soon as he comes out with that, then he becomes a real hero for speaking the truth and for having the courage to say, what is reality?
[1:36:27.140 --> 1:36:37.140]  Because people are seeing this firsthand almost everyone now has a story and all the stories are negative.
[1:36:37.140 --> 1:36:39.140]  There aren't any positive stories.
[1:36:39.140 --> 1:36:46.140]  I've been looking for a positive anecdote to say that, hey, I got 10 unvaccinated friends and 10 vaccinated friends.
[1:36:46.140 --> 1:36:53.140]  And it's only the unvaccinated people who are having injuries and deaths, but it's always the opposite.
[1:36:53.140 --> 1:36:58.140]  It's always the vaccinated group that is having the injuries and death.
[1:36:58.140 --> 1:37:01.140]  And that is becoming quite obvious to people.
[1:37:01.140 --> 1:37:06.140]  And so the sooner people wake up, the sooner this ends.
[1:37:06.140 --> 1:37:13.140]  And Donald Trump could actually be the hero here and end it worldwide.
[1:37:13.140 --> 1:37:18.140]  If Donald Trump comes out, because Donald Trump was a supporter of this, right?
[1:37:18.140 --> 1:37:21.140]  He was the one who created the vaccine in the first place.
[1:37:21.140 --> 1:37:28.140]  So if he comes out with the truth about the vaccine, boy, that's going to wake up a lot of people.
[1:37:28.140 --> 1:37:29.140]  And Steve, I agree.
[1:37:29.140 --> 1:37:30.140]  I would love to.
[1:37:30.140 --> 1:37:35.140]  And I can tell you on grassroots, his listeners, when I even defend him, my listeners are pissed at me.
[1:37:35.140 --> 1:37:37.140]  And I don't do what my listeners want.
[1:37:37.140 --> 1:37:38.140]  I do what I think is right.
[1:37:38.140 --> 1:37:40.140]  Trump's getting a lot of good people elected.
[1:37:40.140 --> 1:37:41.140]  I think overall he did a good job.
[1:37:41.140 --> 1:37:42.140]  He pushed them on the Colonials.
[1:37:42.140 --> 1:37:45.140]  It turned out, you know, to really work, that was another gamble.
[1:37:45.140 --> 1:37:46.140]  He got conned by Fauci.
[1:37:46.140 --> 1:37:48.140]  He wasn't involved funding Wuhan.
[1:37:48.140 --> 1:37:54.140]  And we know a few years into his administration, he was actually killing programs that Fauci was running for gain of function.
[1:37:54.140 --> 1:37:58.140]  So I mean, I can look at the facts and tell you, Trump didn't do this on purpose.
[1:37:58.140 --> 1:38:05.140]  But if he doesn't decouple and extricate himself soon, it begins to come the point where he can't be the hero anymore.
[1:38:05.140 --> 1:38:06.140]  He's tied to this forever.
[1:38:06.140 --> 1:38:07.140]  We really see the setup.
[1:38:07.140 --> 1:38:10.140]  What do you think of that?
[1:38:10.140 --> 1:38:14.140]  Look, the truth has to come out.
[1:38:14.140 --> 1:38:17.140]  The truth always comes out sooner or later.
[1:38:17.140 --> 1:38:21.140]  You always want to be on the right side of history.
[1:38:21.140 --> 1:38:25.140]  And if you're Trump, you like to never be wrong.
[1:38:25.140 --> 1:38:29.140]  I mean, he doesn't like to admit he's wrong, but he has to in this case.
[1:38:29.140 --> 1:38:35.140]  But the point is that if he does that, then he then becomes on the right side of history.
[1:38:35.140 --> 1:38:49.140]  And that forces the Democrats to dig in deeper into this whole defending the vaccine, which will make them lose bigger and bigger and bigger over time because the truth does come out.
[1:38:49.140 --> 1:38:59.140]  And it's amazing to me that these people who have left the CDC and the FDA, boy, they do not want to talk to anybody.
[1:38:59.140 --> 1:39:03.140]  And it's like I'm pleading the fifth.
[1:39:03.140 --> 1:39:05.140]  So think about this.
[1:39:05.140 --> 1:39:19.140]  The people that are leaving the FDA and the CDC do not want to talk on camera to anyone because they don't want to incriminate themselves for participating in this.
[1:39:19.140 --> 1:39:23.140]  So it's pretty obvious what is going on.
[1:39:23.140 --> 1:39:30.140]  There is no way to explain the VAERS data, which is the vaccine adverse event reporting system.
[1:39:30.140 --> 1:39:31.140]  That was my next question.
[1:39:31.140 --> 1:39:32.140]  You're the expert on this.
[1:39:32.140 --> 1:39:35.140]  I'm going to interrupt you, but now you're getting into the data.
[1:39:35.140 --> 1:39:39.140]  Just give us the main data points you get that anybody can check.
[1:39:39.140 --> 1:39:40.140]  Yeah.
[1:39:40.140 --> 1:39:46.140]  Well, anybody can go to openvares.com and there's something called the red box summaries.
[1:39:46.140 --> 1:39:58.140]  And if you go to that page at openvares.com, go to the red box summaries and you flip the slider to show us only because it shows you by default, it shows you the worldwide numbers.
[1:39:58.140 --> 1:40:03.140]  You flip the switch to go U.S. only, you'll see around 14,000 deaths.
[1:40:03.140 --> 1:40:09.140]  Now, the problem there is that the 14,000 are underreported deaths.
[1:40:09.140 --> 1:40:13.140]  So because people don't report to the VAERS system.
[1:40:13.140 --> 1:40:21.140]  And so it turns out that for every death reported to VAERS, they're really about 20.
[1:40:21.140 --> 1:40:25.140]  Sorry, I'm getting into the, let me look at the little light here.
[1:40:25.140 --> 1:40:28.140]  You see the sun shoot you right in the face.
[1:40:28.140 --> 1:40:29.140]  Yeah.
[1:40:29.140 --> 1:40:30.140]  All right.
[1:40:30.140 --> 1:40:32.140]  Now, I escaped that, the death blow here.
[1:40:32.140 --> 1:40:39.140]  But yeah, if you look at the VAERS numbers, you'll see 14,000, you need to multiply that by 41.
[1:40:39.140 --> 1:40:46.140]  And 41 is the basic, it's a conservative underreporting factor for the VAERS data.
[1:40:46.140 --> 1:40:50.140]  So it says that VAERS is only capturing about 2.5% of the events.
[1:40:50.140 --> 1:40:53.140]  So to get the real number of events, you have to multiply by 41.
[1:40:53.140 --> 1:40:56.140]  And when you do that, you get half a million deaths.
[1:40:56.140 --> 1:40:58.140]  Now, some of those were called the deaths.
[1:40:58.140 --> 1:41:03.140]  And some of those were just simply background deaths that just have to coincidental to the vaccine.
[1:41:03.140 --> 1:41:06.140]  But that's a very small number.
[1:41:06.140 --> 1:41:14.140]  What we know is deaths in 2021 and trending this year are way what they were the year before the vaccine.
[1:41:14.140 --> 1:41:15.140]  Oh, yeah.
[1:41:15.140 --> 1:41:21.140]  And from the embalmers themselves, the embalmers are seeing these tell sale blood clots.
[1:41:21.140 --> 1:41:26.140]  They call them blood clots because they look like massive clots, but they're not blood.
[1:41:26.140 --> 1:41:27.140]  That's the thing.
[1:41:27.140 --> 1:41:29.140]  They're not blood.
[1:41:29.140 --> 1:41:35.140]  These things are clots in your arteries and veins, but they are not blood.
[1:41:35.140 --> 1:41:41.140]  So Mike Adams has been looking at these in his labs.
[1:41:41.140 --> 1:41:44.140]  And he's got one of the best labs for looking at this stuff.
[1:41:44.140 --> 1:41:48.140]  And he's finding that they're amyloid proteins and they're not blood.
[1:41:48.140 --> 1:41:50.140]  There's very little blood in these clots.
[1:41:50.140 --> 1:41:56.140]  The embalmers have never seen these clots before the vaccines rolled out.
[1:41:56.140 --> 1:42:02.140]  And they're reporting record numbers of customers, not just the hospitals, not just the undertakers,
[1:42:02.140 --> 1:42:08.140]  not just the funeral homes, but the cemeteries are reporting record numbers of dead people.
[1:42:08.140 --> 1:42:09.140]  Yes.
[1:42:09.140 --> 1:42:16.140]  And so are the people who are manufacturing the coffins, especially the child-sized coffins.
[1:42:16.140 --> 1:42:19.140]  That business has gone up like gangbusters.
[1:42:19.140 --> 1:42:24.140]  You can't even get them the right numbers because people don't want to speak on record
[1:42:24.140 --> 1:42:28.140]  because business is so great, they don't want to have it stopped.
[1:42:28.140 --> 1:42:30.140]  That's right, Steve Kerr, stay right there.
[1:42:30.140 --> 1:42:33.140]  I'm going to try to give you the floor in the last 11-minute segment to talk about whatever you want.
[1:42:33.140 --> 1:42:34.140]  So much knowledge.
[1:42:34.140 --> 1:42:35.140]  I even forgot.
[1:42:35.140 --> 1:42:38.140]  Mainstream news is like record numbers of heart attacks in children, record numbers of coffins,
[1:42:38.140 --> 1:42:40.140]  record numbers of kids dying.
[1:42:40.140 --> 1:42:41.140]  No one knows why.
[1:42:41.140 --> 1:42:47.140]  I mean, it's so incredible that coffin manufacturers are hardly ever producing any little coffins.
[1:42:47.140 --> 1:42:48.140]  They're just pranking them way up.
[1:42:48.140 --> 1:42:51.140]  I mean, this is a Twilight Zone episode, folks, but it's really happening.
[1:42:51.140 --> 1:42:52.140]  Steve Kerr.
[1:42:52.140 --> 1:42:53.140]  SteveKerr.substack.com.
[1:42:53.140 --> 1:42:54.140]  Stay with us.
[1:42:54.140 --> 1:43:23.140]  We'll be right back.
[1:43:24.140 --> 1:43:46.140]  We'll be right back.
[1:43:46.140 --> 1:43:47.140]  Steve Kerr.
[1:43:47.140 --> 1:43:54.140]  Steve Kerr.
[1:44:17.140 --> 1:44:36.140]  Steve Kerr.
[1:44:36.140 --> 1:44:43.180]  year, but we've made a major purchase and it is now in stock for whatever your need is at infowarstore.com.
[1:44:43.180 --> 1:44:49.900]  You'll also find instructional videos and more information at infowarstore.com or vbiopros.com.
[1:44:49.900 --> 1:44:55.660]  Made in America, powered by God's great creation, it is amazing and it funds the info war.
[1:44:58.540 --> 1:45:05.900]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here. And that's what
[1:45:05.900 --> 1:45:11.260]  people recognize and resonate with. And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place
[1:45:11.260 --> 1:45:14.940]  for information. You might not agree with everything. You might not agree with all our
[1:45:14.940 --> 1:45:19.820]  perspectives, but we cover all the information. And there's nowhere else really that does it like
[1:45:19.820 --> 1:45:24.700]  we do here. Thank you for that Ward. Infowarstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions,
[1:45:24.700 --> 1:45:28.860]  infowarstore.com is where to get them folks. And we do have the best supplements. I mean,
[1:45:28.860 --> 1:45:35.580]  just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, we do the best with our
[1:45:35.580 --> 1:45:41.020]  supplements as well. I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula. Folks, this is a joke.
[1:45:41.020 --> 1:45:45.900]  I mean, we're giving this thing away at 75% off. By the way, it works for me. In case you haven't
[1:45:45.900 --> 1:45:53.740]  noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me quite well. I might add quite well. My
[1:45:53.740 --> 1:45:58.060]  barber appreciates hair and beard support for men. I go and see him quite often now.
[1:45:59.260 --> 1:46:04.140]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want you to read
[1:46:04.140 --> 1:46:09.740]  that most of the big powerful companies trying to control your life, the big tech companies,
[1:46:09.740 --> 1:46:14.700]  they don't want you to read this book. They want to control what you think, what you do,
[1:46:14.700 --> 1:46:19.900]  what you read, but you don't want that. And Alex Jones doesn't want that. And this book shows you
[1:46:19.900 --> 1:46:25.340]  what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to fight against it. And so by buying
[1:46:25.340 --> 1:46:30.940]  this book, you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work, that freedom is alive in this country.
[1:46:30.940 --> 1:46:37.100]  This is a central reading. And, you know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks
[1:46:37.100 --> 1:46:42.060]  in. It's not going to be available in bookstores. It's not going to be available in libraries.
[1:46:42.060 --> 1:46:46.300]  They're going to try to take it down from every platform that they can, but they're not going
[1:46:46.300 --> 1:46:51.020]  to be able to do it. Prove that censorship doesn't work by the great reset. Thank you,
[1:46:51.020 --> 1:46:55.740]  Alex Jones. I really appreciate you having me on and I appreciate you writing this book and
[1:46:55.740 --> 1:46:55.740]  getting the information out there.
[1:47:28.380 --> 1:47:31.580]  You don't like to speculate and you've been exposing this for several years,
[1:47:31.580 --> 1:47:36.540]  warning it's all been confirmed that you were accurate. I want you to be able to those last
[1:47:36.540 --> 1:47:41.420]  10 minutes cover whatever topics or loose ends you want to hit and respond to the big controversy
[1:47:41.420 --> 1:47:46.220]  you on Fox News or Carlson. And I'm scared they are. So spend some time on that, but also just
[1:47:46.220 --> 1:47:51.740]  big picture as a citizen, as an entrepreneur, as an engineer, looking at the motive of this and
[1:47:51.740 --> 1:47:56.540]  them still doubling down. I mean, obviously you said earlier, the evidence all points were premeditated.
[1:47:56.540 --> 1:48:00.860]  They had the patents. They had the roll out. They set Trump up to go along with it. Democrats
[1:48:00.860 --> 1:48:05.100]  when the shot was first coming off said, I don't trust any shot he says, but as soon as he's gone,
[1:48:05.100 --> 1:48:09.020]  they love the shot. I mean, it's pretty clear to see what's happening here. I think it's pretty
[1:48:09.020 --> 1:48:14.460]  clear to see it's not going well for the Klaus Schwab's and Fauci's of the world. That's a lot
[1:48:14.460 --> 1:48:23.180]  to deconstruct, but just hit it however you want. There's so much to cover. So, Alex, do you know
[1:48:23.180 --> 1:48:30.540]  how much Tony Fauci is making every time a Moderna shot is delivered into someone's arm?
[1:48:32.140 --> 1:48:33.100]  And I know it's a lot.
[1:48:35.580 --> 1:48:42.220]  Well, you see, that's the problem. So we have somebody who's directing this entire vaccination
[1:48:42.220 --> 1:48:51.980]  program who has a huge conflict of interest. That is not something that should be allowed.
[1:48:54.620 --> 1:49:01.500]  We should know exactly how much he's making on these vaccines, and we're not allowed to know that.
[1:49:01.500 --> 1:49:05.740]  And when we try to get that information through Freedom of Information Act requests,
[1:49:05.740 --> 1:49:13.980]  it's denied. It's basically, it is blacked out of the answer that comes back on a Freedom
[1:49:13.980 --> 1:49:21.420]  of Information Act request. So how can you have the guy who created the virus in the first place,
[1:49:21.420 --> 1:49:28.140]  and now he's getting paid every time the vaccine from Moderna is delivered? You know,
[1:49:28.140 --> 1:49:33.100]  the Moderna vaccine, most people don't know this, but the official name of the Moderna vaccine
[1:49:33.100 --> 1:49:41.100]  is the Moderna NIAID vaccine. So they're in cahoots with the government to push this on you,
[1:49:41.100 --> 1:49:48.380]  and the people at NIH, like Tony Fauci, make money every time you get the shot.
[1:49:48.380 --> 1:49:53.900]  This is why they're pushing it. This is why ivermectin doesn't work, and fluvoxamine doesn't work,
[1:49:53.900 --> 1:49:59.660]  and all these other drugs don't work, is because they're not supposed to work, because if they
[1:49:59.660 --> 1:50:04.860]  did work, then Fauci's not going to get paid, and we don't know how much it is. We don't know whether
[1:50:04.860 --> 1:50:10.780]  it's 10 million, 100 million, a billion dollars. We don't know. We're not allowed to know. Now,
[1:50:10.780 --> 1:50:17.180]  Congress isn't even asking that question, and Congress, the Democrats in Congress,
[1:50:17.180 --> 1:50:24.860]  any Democratic committee chairman in Congress, can request from the NIH Tony Fauci's unredacted
[1:50:24.860 --> 1:50:33.580]  emails, and that would tell us the coordination that Fauci did in order to make it look like it
[1:50:33.580 --> 1:50:39.500]  came from nature rather than a lab leak, because there was a set of emails that that were not
[1:50:39.500 --> 1:50:45.740]  redacted, where it showed that it was a lab leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,
[1:50:45.740 --> 1:50:52.940]  and then all of a sudden, with redacted emails, we now then come to get the story that, oh,
[1:50:52.940 --> 1:51:00.220]  it came out of nature with no new evidence. Well, you know, we could unlock what really happened
[1:51:00.220 --> 1:51:06.620]  there if somebody would look at Tony's unredacted emails, but isn't it amazing that we had a
[1:51:06.620 --> 1:51:13.980]  presidential commission looking into this, and the presidential commission never asked the NIH
[1:51:13.980 --> 1:51:22.620]  for Tony Fauci's unredacted emails? It is amazing. And then when there was an independent panel put
[1:51:22.620 --> 1:51:29.260]  together by the Lancet to look into this, and Professor Jeffrey Sachs was the head of it,
[1:51:29.260 --> 1:51:38.940]  and he found that, oh, this virus came out of a US Biolab, which is true. I mean, it was part
[1:51:38.940 --> 1:51:46.940]  US Biolab and part Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is why the WHO was never granted full access
[1:51:46.940 --> 1:51:53.660]  to look at what the Wuhan Institute of Virology was working on. That was not denied. You know,
[1:51:53.660 --> 1:52:01.260]  so there's this huge coverup, and it's amazing that no government in the world wants to know the
[1:52:01.260 --> 1:52:10.380]  source of the coronavirus that has just decimated the entire world. Nobody wants to look at where
[1:52:10.380 --> 1:52:17.420]  it really came from, because Jeffrey Sachs has said, hmm, this is looking like it came from a US Lab.
[1:52:17.420 --> 1:52:25.500]  And as soon as he said that, then everybody's interest in finding the source of the SARS-CoV-2
[1:52:25.500 --> 1:52:29.020]  virus just evaporated. Nobody wants to know.
[1:52:29.020 --> 1:52:34.540]  That level gates and all of them are saying more things are coming, monkey pops, polio.
[1:52:34.540 --> 1:52:37.740]  I've seen a lot of evidence that's actually linked to vaccine side effects are just claiming that.
[1:52:37.740 --> 1:52:41.260]  What do you make of all the new fair mongering and new calls for lockdowns?
[1:52:42.860 --> 1:52:52.380]  Well, you know, this is all self-created here, that the people involved are just manufacturing
[1:52:52.380 --> 1:52:57.340]  a crisis after crisis after crisis. And in fact, the more people get vaccinated,
[1:52:57.340 --> 1:53:02.220]  the more deaths we're going to have, and the more injuries and the more crises we're going to have,
[1:53:02.220 --> 1:53:08.460]  and the more vulnerabilities everybody is going to have here. So it's just feeding on itself.
[1:53:08.460 --> 1:53:16.460]  It is just almost never ending. And the solution to all of this, to get back to normal, is always,
[1:53:16.460 --> 1:53:21.100]  well, it'll be in the next vaccine. It'll be in the next vaccine. Oh, there's no new vaccine
[1:53:21.100 --> 1:53:27.420]  that'll have Omicron in it. And, you know, it's repeating the same thing over and over again
[1:53:27.420 --> 1:53:32.700]  and expecting a different result. And people need to get wise that it's actually all these
[1:53:32.700 --> 1:53:41.660]  mitigation strategies that have made and perpetuated this pandemic. If we had just treated this virus
[1:53:41.660 --> 1:53:49.260]  with the repurposed drugs like Fareed and Tyson had a protocol way back in March of 2020,
[1:53:49.260 --> 1:53:55.020]  when this whole thing started, and they have the number of deaths and hospitalizations,
[1:53:55.020 --> 1:54:01.500]  they can count on one finger, like it's zero. If you got treated early enough,
[1:54:01.500 --> 1:54:07.580]  it is they had no hospitalizations and they had no deaths. And the NIH was not interested in their
[1:54:07.580 --> 1:54:13.020]  early treatment protocols. And theirs is not the only one that's effective. So we can end this
[1:54:13.020 --> 1:54:17.900]  entire pandemic anytime we want. Steve, I totally agree. Let me ask you this.
[1:54:17.900 --> 1:54:24.060]  Why do you think Fauci resigned today? I'm seeing major heat on him.
[1:54:25.100 --> 1:54:28.620]  What can we do to bring these people to justice? Because for me, it's not about being vindictive.
[1:54:28.620 --> 1:54:33.020]  We've got to punish these mad scientists so they don't do this again. As Senator Paul has said,
[1:54:33.020 --> 1:54:35.820]  because we know they've got stuff a lot worse than this thing they cooked up.
[1:54:38.380 --> 1:54:43.500]  Yeah, you know, I think it's trying to like to pack the bags and get out of the country and
[1:54:43.500 --> 1:54:52.300]  disappear where he can't be found before people get wise. The wheels are falling off the bus
[1:54:52.300 --> 1:54:58.620]  here. And I've got an article on my substack, SteveKersh.substack.com. It's the top article,
[1:54:58.620 --> 1:55:03.580]  it's the pinned article. And it talks about basically the false narrative is starting to
[1:55:03.580 --> 1:55:11.260]  fall apart and it's becoming very obvious to people. And you look at Twitter and somebody dies.
[1:55:11.260 --> 1:55:16.540]  And it's like, yeah, yeah, another vaccine death, they're covering it up. And doctors aren't allowed
[1:55:16.540 --> 1:55:20.780]  to speak out about this because they're going to have their licenses revoked. But you know,
[1:55:20.780 --> 1:55:25.500]  there's some states where doctors are protected. And so doctors are starting to speak out and say,
[1:55:25.500 --> 1:55:30.220]  hey, they can take away my license, I'm going to do the right thing here. And it's even better
[1:55:30.220 --> 1:55:34.220]  when you're retiring. When you're retiring, then you can start to speak the truth. And
[1:55:34.220 --> 1:55:41.340]  you know, so it's becoming apparent. I think Fauci is realizing that this thing is falling
[1:55:41.340 --> 1:55:47.820]  apart. You know, I've been emailing hundreds of people involved in the vaccine effort inside
[1:55:47.820 --> 1:55:52.380]  the CDC. And you know, maybe that's starting to have effect. Maybe there's they're starting.
[1:55:52.380 --> 1:55:56.140]  Oh, there's no doubt you and Dr. McCullough and others are having some of the cheap effects we
[1:55:56.140 --> 1:56:01.740]  salute you. And I see Klaus Schwab coming out announcing 110,000 info warriors to counter vaccine
[1:56:01.740 --> 1:56:05.500]  disinfo. They've all been proven to be liars. Everybody knows everything they said wasn't
[1:56:05.500 --> 1:56:10.860]  true. So nothing is going to put their their their giant fraud back together again. And the more of
[1:56:10.860 --> 1:56:14.220]  us they target, the more people are going to stand up. Steve Kersh, people should find your
[1:56:14.220 --> 1:56:21.100]  incredible information at your sub stack and so much more. Thank you so much for your work.
[1:56:21.100 --> 1:56:25.820]  Thank you for everything you're doing. And I know you did it because you care about people,
[1:56:25.820 --> 1:56:27.900]  but still you're a hero. And we congratulate you, sir.
[1:56:27.900 --> 1:56:34.540]  Thank you very much, Alex. And thank you for the opportunity to talk to the American people on
[1:56:34.540 --> 1:56:39.580]  your show. Something I don't get on Fox News or something I don't get on CNN, something I won't
[1:56:39.580 --> 1:56:44.220]  get in the Washington Post or any other mainstream media. Thank you, sir. And that's why info
[1:56:44.220 --> 1:56:49.420]  wars is important. We have long, hour long interviews where people really get to talk and
[1:56:49.420 --> 1:56:52.780]  put on evidence. And that's why the system hates us. Steve Kersh, thank you so much.
[1:56:53.500 --> 1:56:57.340]  Edward Dow, who's super articulate and exposed this several years as well. I want to focus
[1:56:57.340 --> 1:57:01.980]  on the shots. They don't want us talking about it. He's going to join us on HSBC. He's going to be
[1:57:01.980 --> 1:57:08.540]  joining us to talk about the society and the actuaries and what it's showing from the insurance
[1:57:08.540 --> 1:57:13.740]  company is the latest information. The evidence is overwhelming with Edward Dow. Please don't forget.

[1:57:44.140 --> 1:57:52.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, if millions of people get this book, our funding problems will be over

[1:57:59.180 --> 1:58:04.300]  said go to Amazon because it's the number one book chart in the world. And if it goes to number
[1:58:04.300 --> 1:58:09.580]  one, not a political, not of history, not of US history, it's already number one over 40 categories
[1:58:09.580 --> 1:58:15.100]  like political science, you name it. 40 plus categories is number one. Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:58:15.100 --> 1:58:21.580]  drum roll, please, of books in the world. The great reset in the war for the world is one,
[1:58:21.580 --> 1:58:30.380]  two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. We are now number nine in the world. This is major.
[1:58:30.380 --> 1:58:36.540]  This is political. This could fund our war chest. Just go to Amazon.com everybody and buy 10 copies.
[1:58:36.540 --> 1:58:41.660]  Send this blueprint to the Death Star and the New World Order. As you read this, you know their
[1:58:41.660 --> 1:58:45.100]  whole plan how to stop them. Get the great reset in the war for the world. Now it's going to go to
[1:58:45.100 --> 1:58:53.580]  number one. What do you make of that? We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse in
[1:58:53.580 --> 1:59:00.060]  the strange space between what we've known and what's to come. And right now, the most important
[1:59:00.060 --> 1:59:07.100]  thing to remember is don't panic. Stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings
[1:59:07.100 --> 1:59:13.740]  and steer the ship onto a safe sound course. There is nothing stopping we the people from making
[1:59:13.740 --> 1:59:20.940]  our own rules and building our own society. All we got to do is survive the crash. And right now,
[1:59:20.940 --> 1:59:27.500]  we still have time to prepare. The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero. It's
[1:59:27.500 --> 1:59:34.860]  time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water, and survival gear to keep us strong
[1:59:34.860 --> 1:59:42.780]  and at the ready. Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials, storable foods, water filtration,
[1:59:42.780 --> 1:59:54.460]  first aid, power, and more at preparedtoday.com. If you are receiving this transmission, you are
[1:59:54.460 --> 1:59:59.020]  the resistance.
[2:00:09.980 --> 2:00:17.580]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones. All right, he's only with us
[2:00:17.580 --> 2:00:21.740]  for 30 minutes and I had a bunch of other economic and military news the bottom of the hour. Edward
[2:00:21.740 --> 2:00:27.900]  Dow doesn't need any introduction or HSBC, Black Rock and so many other big institutions. He made
[2:00:27.900 --> 2:00:32.540]  a lot of predictions that have come true because that's what his job was, was a trans forecaster
[2:00:32.540 --> 2:00:37.260]  and stock picker. He's been going over the actuaries and numbers out of insurance companies and more
[2:00:37.260 --> 2:00:41.420]  and now the wheels are coming off the established Fauci resigns. And as they say, okay, the vaccine
[2:00:41.420 --> 2:00:46.540]  doesn't work. I know it does make you sick. This is blowing up in their face big time. But if you
[2:00:46.540 --> 2:00:51.580]  read the Spars War Game, it predicted this would all happen. So there's something bigger here about
[2:00:51.580 --> 2:00:56.860]  Austin trust in the system and more. So we'll get his deep expertise on this the next 30 minutes.
[2:00:56.860 --> 2:01:02.380]  I'm going to try to give him the floor. Mr. Dowd, where should we begin? Dowd is of course going
[2:01:02.380 --> 2:01:08.140]  to be found at Dowd Ward on Twitter and Getter at Edward Dowd. So good to have you here with us.
[2:01:08.140 --> 2:01:15.580]  Where do you want to start? Yeah, thank you, Alex. Great to be back. I love to start with the millennial
[2:01:15.580 --> 2:01:24.140]  chart that I put on famously brought on your show in March, where we showed my Wall Street
[2:01:24.140 --> 2:01:31.580]  insurance partner and I showed that into the fall of 2021, there were from the CDC data,
[2:01:31.580 --> 2:01:39.020]  there were excess deaths in the millennial age group of age 25 to 44. And the millennial chart,
[2:01:39.020 --> 2:01:45.820]  I said this, I'll talk about that in a second, but the millennial chart, there it is, there it is.
[2:01:45.820 --> 2:01:56.060]  You can see the millennials into the fall ages 25 to 44 experienced a temporal 84% rise in excess
[2:01:56.060 --> 2:02:01.900]  mortality, which represented 61,000 individuals over the course of that year, which is a Vietnam War.
[2:02:01.900 --> 2:02:09.580]  The mandates, the mandates occurred in August, September, October. That's that spike,
[2:02:09.580 --> 2:02:19.980]  84% above normal. And that is it. Now, that was done with CDC data by my Josh Stirling,
[2:02:19.980 --> 2:02:27.820]  who's starting to become public. He's a former Wall Street insurance analyst for Bernstein.
[2:02:27.820 --> 2:02:38.060]  And that's a very top notch research Wall Street firm, Alliance Bernstein. And he discovered this,
[2:02:38.060 --> 2:02:44.860]  I made it famous. Now, let me tell you what we learned on Wednesday last week. Last week,
[2:02:44.860 --> 2:02:51.260]  the Society of Actuaries, SOA, and they have a research institute issued a report.
[2:02:51.260 --> 2:02:59.180]  And that's the second chart I want to show. This is table 5.7 from the Society of Actuaries.
[2:02:59.820 --> 2:03:06.620]  This basically confirms our analysis. This represents 80% of the group life industry.
[2:03:06.620 --> 2:03:13.100]  This is the survey of their industry. These are actuaries doing this. You can see in Q3 of 2021,
[2:03:13.100 --> 2:03:22.780]  the red, ages 25 to 34, and 35 to 44. That's the age group we looked at. You can see 100%
[2:03:22.780 --> 2:03:30.780]  represents normal. Above 100 is excess. So in those two age groups, it was 78% in Q3,
[2:03:30.780 --> 2:03:38.060]  and 100% in Q3. We came up with 84 for the combined group. So what we want to say is that
[2:03:38.060 --> 2:03:44.540]  our numbers have been confirmed by the Society of Actuaries. Now, we knew our numbers were right,
[2:03:44.540 --> 2:03:52.300]  but it just literally gives credence to what we've been saying on your show in March to alert people
[2:03:52.300 --> 2:03:58.540]  on band and show and other venues. So I just want to applaud you for letting us on here to present
[2:03:58.540 --> 2:04:03.100]  this data. Oh, yes, sir. And listen, some stations, we have over 400 affiliates, but some don't carry
[2:04:03.100 --> 2:04:07.340]  this segment. So we need drumroll or something. This is horrible news, but it's also good that
[2:04:07.340 --> 2:04:11.420]  we can prove it, that you've been proven right since you were first talking about this years ago,
[2:04:11.420 --> 2:04:15.180]  and now it's all come out in the last year. What are they going to do? I want to come back,
[2:04:15.180 --> 2:04:18.540]  and I want to just go through these again. But I mean, for those that don't know,
[2:04:19.500 --> 2:04:25.100]  the gold, the platinum standard of statistics is insurance actuaries. They don't mess around.
[2:04:25.100 --> 2:04:29.660]  And when the Society of Insurance Actuaries that's indexing all these insurance companies
[2:04:29.660 --> 2:04:34.780]  sees this, these are hard numbers. I mean, this is stuff you can take to the bank. Edward Dowd
[2:04:34.780 --> 2:04:39.020]  stayed with us. I don't know whether I want to clap or expose the murderers or throw up. I actually
[2:04:39.020 --> 2:04:45.020]  feel physically sick right now. I mean, this is, we are, this is hitlerian level stuff or bigger
[2:04:45.020 --> 2:04:49.020]  in our hands. And these sons of bitches knew exactly what they were doing. Well,
[2:04:49.020 --> 2:04:50.860]  they're right back with Edward Dowd in 60 seconds.
[2:04:50.860 --> 2:05:04.460]  The Cavalry for your immune system, the Cavalry for your health,
[2:05:04.460 --> 2:05:10.380]  and the Cavalry to keep Info Wars on the air with funding has now arrived, a 360 win.
[2:05:11.100 --> 2:05:18.620]  Almost sold out for a year. DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ10 and all the patented,
[2:05:18.620 --> 2:05:26.540]  documented super ingredients to completely turbocharge your immune system and your body is
[2:05:26.540 --> 2:05:32.060]  finally back in stock. And despite the fact it's going to sell out quick, I want those of you that
[2:05:32.060 --> 2:05:36.860]  haven't experienced it to get it. And I want long-term supporters to experience it as well.
[2:05:36.860 --> 2:05:44.060]  So it is 50% off out of the gates for a limited time. DNA Force Plus, finally back in stock
[2:05:44.060 --> 2:05:51.420]  at infowarstore.com for 50% off. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a symbiotic relationship
[2:05:52.220 --> 2:05:56.620]  supporting Info Wars defeats the globalist and this product does amazing things for your body.
[2:05:56.620 --> 2:05:57.500]  Take action now.
[2:06:04.940 --> 2:06:11.580]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[2:06:11.580 --> 2:06:19.340]  front lines of the Info War. Hi, ladies and gentlemen, the big international consortium
[2:06:19.340 --> 2:06:25.020]  of insurance company actuaries where they pull their numbers so they can accurately predict
[2:06:25.660 --> 2:06:32.460]  trends has confirmed what Edward Dowd and previously a whistleblower high-level at
[2:06:32.460 --> 2:06:38.620]  top insurance actuary company gave him info a year ago that he laid out on Steve Bannon's show,
[2:06:38.620 --> 2:06:45.260]  our show everywhere, confirming massive increase in deaths in young people right after the shots.
[2:06:45.820 --> 2:06:51.580]  And now the major international actuary group has confirmed his whistleblowers information,
[2:06:51.580 --> 2:06:55.980]  his info. And he said this, you know, a year ago on Bannon and other shows, he said,
[2:06:57.580 --> 2:07:01.100]  I have the whistleblower inside the actuaries, it's going to come out, but right now I'm going
[2:07:01.100 --> 2:07:07.180]  to put it out. Well, now it's confirmed. This is incredible news, but they know what they're doing.
[2:07:07.180 --> 2:07:10.780]  It's ongoing. Fauci's resigned. They're now admitting the shots don't work. They're not
[2:07:10.780 --> 2:07:14.700]  admitting they're hurting people. The wheels are coming off. What are they going to do next? I mean,
[2:07:14.700 --> 2:07:19.500]  this is an incredible moment in history. And then ask the question, why would global big
[2:07:19.500 --> 2:07:24.700]  pharma companies try a gamble like this? Or is there something bigger here? Because the Spars
[2:07:24.700 --> 2:07:32.140]  document a few years before COVID 2025, 2028 really based in 2020, 2023 war games that a year
[2:07:32.140 --> 2:07:36.380]  and a half in it turns out it doesn't work and kills you destroys confidence in governments
[2:07:36.380 --> 2:07:42.620]  and causes a global civil war. Yeah. And he's talked about that and forecast this two years ago.
[2:07:42.620 --> 2:07:47.660]  So he's a top trends forecaster, former top stock picker. Some stations just joined us or recap the
[2:07:48.700 --> 2:07:52.380]  I mean, just I don't even have words to describe how huge this news is. Take your time, sir.
[2:07:53.980 --> 2:08:00.620]  So bottom line, the society of actuaries, now they're not going to come to the same conclusions
[2:08:00.620 --> 2:08:06.700]  that you and I have come to and that's fine. But the numbers are the numbers we said on your show
[2:08:06.700 --> 2:08:14.540]  in February, March of this year, that the millennials experienced a rise of 84% excess
[2:08:14.540 --> 2:08:21.980]  mortality into the mandate quarter Q3. That represented over the course of March of 2021
[2:08:21.980 --> 2:08:28.220]  through February 2022 61,000 millennials, which represents basically a Vietnam War for the
[2:08:28.220 --> 2:08:37.500]  millennial age group silent war. Then last week, the society of actuaries put out in table 5.7.
[2:08:38.220 --> 2:08:43.980]  The excess mortality from their revenues, 80% of the revenues represented in this report.
[2:08:43.980 --> 2:08:53.100]  And there it is. Basically, confirming what we said 78% and 200% we came up with 84%. So
[2:08:53.100 --> 2:08:56.940]  that's that the numbers of the numbers we've been vindicated were right.
[2:08:56.940 --> 2:09:00.700]  But the folks that aren't an expert like you will lay out what those numbers mean.
[2:09:01.740 --> 2:09:12.620]  So basically, a hundred is normal death rate. In the Q3, 78% more people died,
[2:09:12.620 --> 2:09:21.260]  more claims happened in the insurance industry for the ages 25 to 34 and 100% between 35 and 44.
[2:09:21.260 --> 2:09:29.180]  We analyzed 25 to 44, we came up with 84%. So 84% excess mortality in the claims
[2:09:29.180 --> 2:09:34.140]  of group life insurance companies. Now, the thing to remember about group life,
[2:09:34.140 --> 2:09:42.460]  now that confirms the CDC data that we saw. Group life are claims against people that are employed
[2:09:42.460 --> 2:09:51.900]  in companies who tend to be not drug addicts tend to be happily employed and healthy. So the
[2:09:51.900 --> 2:09:58.780]  numbers just foot because the naysayers were telling me, well, well, Ed, those deaths occurred
[2:09:58.780 --> 2:10:04.620]  because of lockdowns and suicides and fentanyl overdoses and missing cancer screening treatments.
[2:10:05.180 --> 2:10:11.660]  My argument has always been temporally in three months that was a dramatic rise in deaths.
[2:10:11.660 --> 2:10:19.820]  That was when Biden and corporations mandated vaccines. And you can see from the red highlighted
[2:10:19.820 --> 2:10:25.260]  by their own report, there was an event. What was the event? It was mandates. What did those
[2:10:25.260 --> 2:10:31.580]  mandates result in? Demosyde, death by government. I've said it before and I'll say it again. Demosyde.
[2:10:32.700 --> 2:10:37.020]  And we've seen similar numbers around the world and even mainstream news is reporting now.
[2:10:37.020 --> 2:10:41.660]  Oh, it's normal. Record heart attacks in children and young people. Record blood clots. Oh, sitting
[2:10:41.660 --> 2:10:47.580]  at your desk is why you're dying. Look, again, I go back to the CDC document, October 2000,
[2:10:47.580 --> 2:10:52.540]  predicted adverse reactions, microcarditis, blood clots over 30 things and everything they
[2:10:52.540 --> 2:10:57.100]  predicted happened. So why would they put a report out predicting it and then do it? Big picture.
[2:10:57.100 --> 2:11:02.060]  I know you don't want to speculate, but as a citizen, as a human, ever doubt because you did
[2:11:02.060 --> 2:11:07.340]  this over two years ago on a tweet, you predicted and you said this is about societal collapse.
[2:11:07.340 --> 2:11:15.260]  So look, I'm spitballing here. This is just, this is me predicting the future without
[2:11:15.260 --> 2:11:22.220]  having inside knowledge, but I am into game theory. I'm into the Hegelian dialectic. I'm into
[2:11:22.860 --> 2:11:30.140]  all sorts of, you know, if I was an evil person and I wanted to put in a control system, how would
[2:11:30.140 --> 2:11:38.860]  I do it? Well, you know, obviously I would have some villains like Klaus Schwab, Harari, Fauci,
[2:11:39.500 --> 2:11:46.460]  Gates, some front men who think they're running the show, but they implement this and it creates
[2:11:46.460 --> 2:11:52.860]  a collapse in trust of institutions and society. And the goal is to introduce a central bank digital
[2:11:52.860 --> 2:11:58.940]  currency and some sort of social credit score and control. You can't sell that. So you get these
[2:11:58.940 --> 2:12:07.820]  clowns to do it in such a comical evil fashion that it's a joke. We then defeat these people,
[2:12:07.820 --> 2:12:14.620]  Fauci's resigning. You'll see these guys will fall. Then as they fall, remember, we'll be in the
[2:12:14.620 --> 2:12:19.020]  middle of an economic collapse. Everyone will be afraid and fearful. There might be a war.
[2:12:19.020 --> 2:12:25.340]  There might be a Taiwan war, Taiwanese war. Who knows? But events are coming. Again,
[2:12:25.340 --> 2:12:30.860]  I'm spitballing. I don't have a crystal ball. And then out of left field, once these guys go
[2:12:30.860 --> 2:12:37.660]  off to the jail, some very handsome, well-sounding, reasonable people come up with a solution that
[2:12:37.660 --> 2:12:42.380]  looks great, but, you know, underneath the surface of it, it's, it's the, that's what they wanted
[2:12:42.380 --> 2:12:46.540]  to implement anyways, but. And we're down. I totally agree with you. And of course, you don't
[2:12:46.540 --> 2:12:50.700]  like to speculate, but you're, you know, you're dead on. Let's explain, getting a dialectic,
[2:12:50.700 --> 2:12:55.340]  the easiest way to explain it. Okay. You can go back to Hegel's analysis of it, which was
[2:12:55.340 --> 2:13:00.300]  previously used under other names, but he quantified it in the last 200 years. Let's take a wave pool
[2:13:01.020 --> 2:13:05.660]  and you want, you've got engines that, that aren't big enough to create a wave to go over the wall,
[2:13:06.460 --> 2:13:11.180]  but you can combine the waves with two wave generators. And if you have a computer, you know
[2:13:11.180 --> 2:13:15.740]  how to crash the waves together to form a super wave to do what you want. That's the easiest way
[2:13:15.740 --> 2:13:20.060]  with the dialectics is you're not just doing one action or two actions or five. You're calculating
[2:13:20.060 --> 2:13:25.340]  historically what those waves will then generate to create the actual outcome you want. So it's
[2:13:25.340 --> 2:13:29.100]  not one dimensional or even two dimensional or three dimensional. It's four dimensional thinking.
[2:13:30.860 --> 2:13:36.380]  Absolutely. And, you know, look, the classic description of Hegelian dialectic is problem
[2:13:36.380 --> 2:13:43.020]  reaction solution. And there's a bunch of different dialectics being run at the same time.
[2:13:44.220 --> 2:13:48.060]  The one we're talking about, you and I are talking about is what's the problem? The problem is we
[2:13:48.060 --> 2:13:54.780]  get these crazy bond villain types you want to implement global control. The reaction is
[2:13:55.420 --> 2:14:03.500]  you and me and people getting mad about that. And you run a vaccine program that kills off all
[2:14:03.500 --> 2:14:09.900]  sorts of people and people get angry. And then there's an economic collapse, a loss of trust
[2:14:09.900 --> 2:14:18.460]  in institutions. And then the solution is some very nice, well-meaning, well-spoken, good-looking
[2:14:18.460 --> 2:14:23.420]  people with a solution that's not as bad as the one that was pitched to us.
[2:14:23.420 --> 2:14:26.860]  That's right. You give them an angrier world as Klaus Schwab knows what he's part of.
[2:14:27.580 --> 2:14:33.020]  He's playing the part of the bond villain, which he is. And then they give you the saviors from that.
[2:14:33.020 --> 2:14:40.380]  Correct. Now, this is all speculation on my part. But if I was writing the movie script, that's what
[2:14:40.380 --> 2:14:46.860]  I would do. But see, I don't see it as speculation. I've read Zbrenski's books. I've read hundreds
[2:14:46.860 --> 2:14:51.500]  of books by these people. They all brag about this. And it's not speculation. When you predict
[2:14:51.500 --> 2:14:55.900]  you've done it, I've done it hundreds of times. And it comes exactly true. You just start seeing
[2:14:55.900 --> 2:15:00.300]  things from their perspective. And then it's deadly clear once you get into Hegelian wargaming.
[2:15:00.300 --> 2:15:08.300]  Yeah. Look, I'm speculating. But if I had to bet capital on my speculation, I would make a big bet on it.
[2:15:10.860 --> 2:15:11.660]  What comes next?
[2:15:14.060 --> 2:15:19.180]  So we got the midterms. They tried monkeypox. I don't think that's going to fly.
[2:15:21.420 --> 2:15:27.100]  I'm worried about China. I'm worried about what's going on there. They hit a demographic cliff
[2:15:27.100 --> 2:15:34.380]  in 2020. And they have a debt problem, an internal debt problem based on unproductive assets that they
[2:15:35.660 --> 2:15:39.580]  overlevered into, which is real estate. So there's a real estate collapse, which is causing
[2:15:40.140 --> 2:15:45.900]  a banking collapse. And there's internal issues there. And when you have that kind of internal
[2:15:45.900 --> 2:15:50.620]  issues, you need an enemy outside of. That's right. So at the end of a bubble, and China's
[2:15:50.620 --> 2:15:53.820]  problem is the worst, we all have the same problem. This is where you get these great
[2:15:53.820 --> 2:15:59.100]  research. What does that mean? Try to add the best product. I'm not I'm not supposed to be biased.
[2:15:59.100 --> 2:16:02.780]  But I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried turbo force, you need to try it. I've tried
[2:16:02.780 --> 2:16:08.060]  turbo force with everything. Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my
[2:16:08.060 --> 2:16:12.300]  coffee. That was a crazy week. I don't remember sleeping. But as far as the products go, turbo
[2:16:12.300 --> 2:16:16.140]  force is my favorite. And all the info wars products are down to taking control your life,
[2:16:16.140 --> 2:16:22.140]  taking control your health, not relying on other people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in the
[2:16:22.140 --> 2:16:26.940]  morning and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life. I'm going to wake up
[2:16:26.940 --> 2:16:31.100]  today. You know, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier,
[2:16:31.100 --> 2:16:34.780]  happier and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that
[2:16:34.780 --> 2:16:38.140]  happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[2:16:38.140 --> 2:16:41.820]  Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only one
[2:16:41.820 --> 2:16:45.660]  person who woke up and thought that and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay,
[2:16:45.660 --> 2:16:48.700]  I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health. And that's why you need to

[2:21:19.180 --> 2:21:22.780]  So ever doubt, I can ask you a thousand questions. I really respect you. You've been vindicated.
[2:21:22.780 --> 2:21:27.340]  I'm sad you've been vindicated. Other key points the next eight minutes you want to impart to the
[2:21:27.340 --> 2:21:35.340]  millions watching right now. Sure. Let me make a little more short term predictions that might
[2:21:35.340 --> 2:21:43.340]  be helpful to people. The real economy is imploding as we speak. Since June, we've had what's called
[2:21:43.340 --> 2:21:49.740]  a stock market rally. So everyone is relaxing thinking everything's fine. If I had to guess,
[2:21:50.380 --> 2:21:55.980]  I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I'm fairly confident that the stock market rally peaked
[2:21:55.980 --> 2:22:02.060]  out last Tuesday and we're not going to begin the descent into the fall in the midterms.
[2:22:02.060 --> 2:22:08.700]  And by the way, you were on six months ago and predicted basically exactly right the last downturn.
[2:22:09.980 --> 2:22:15.820]  Yeah. So I think there's a good chance that the rally from this summer ended last Tuesday.
[2:22:16.940 --> 2:22:21.340]  We've had a little bit of a sell off. I'm not a hundred percent sure, but fairly confident
[2:22:21.340 --> 2:22:27.580]  that it's begun. How do I know that? The Baltic dry index, which is the daily average prices of
[2:22:27.580 --> 2:22:34.700]  the shipping of raw materials across the globe hit a new low last week. And that's a leading
[2:22:34.700 --> 2:22:42.620]  indicator. So the real economy is imploding. In the state of Hawaii, year to date, we've seen
[2:22:43.260 --> 2:22:52.460]  refi and resale home applications drop 51 percent and home resale alone has dropped 27 percent. So
[2:22:52.460 --> 2:22:58.460]  the real estate market's rolling over. The real economy is rolling over. Building permits are
[2:22:58.460 --> 2:23:04.060]  rolling over. So even though the summer may seem like, oh, the stock market's okay, I'm here to
[2:23:04.060 --> 2:23:11.020]  tell you we're about to go into a bit of a tailspin into the midterm elections. How many do you
[2:23:11.020 --> 2:23:16.540]  think this will be compared to the last downturn that you predicted? So we lost about 20 percent
[2:23:16.540 --> 2:23:23.900]  into June from my call in January, February. If I'm right, and I don't want to get into the
[2:23:23.900 --> 2:23:31.500]  technical stuff of it because it's mumbo jumbo, but if we take out the June low, we're looking at a
[2:23:32.940 --> 2:23:38.620]  30, 40 percent correction into the fall from the top in January. So from the June low, another 10
[2:23:38.620 --> 2:23:46.780]  to 20 percent. And when do you see that slide starting? It's IBM has started last Tuesday.
[2:23:48.940 --> 2:23:52.540]  What can we do to try to stabilize the planet? These dark forces want to destabilize it. What
[2:23:52.540 --> 2:24:05.340]  can an average person do? Well, call to arms is not to live in fear, not to panic, to align yourself
[2:24:05.340 --> 2:24:12.140]  with like-minded people, create human networks. Look, I don't have crystal ball, but there may
[2:24:12.140 --> 2:24:18.060]  come a time where if you have relationships based on transactions, meaning you have security guards
[2:24:18.060 --> 2:24:23.580]  and you're rich and people are taking care of you, you better have some friends that will help you
[2:24:23.580 --> 2:24:30.300]  regardless of your money. I've done that here on Maui. I got in a car accident. There's a backup
[2:24:30.300 --> 2:24:36.620]  on getting your car fixed. Within two hours, I had two cars loaned to me that I can use indefinitely.
[2:24:36.620 --> 2:24:39.820]  Exactly. Human community is the most valuable capital in a collapse.
[2:24:42.380 --> 2:24:46.700]  And if you don't have networks and you don't have friends, you should start thinking about
[2:24:46.700 --> 2:24:51.420]  getting them right now. Oh, yeah. In our bankruptcy, they'd ask me, why are you spending all your
[2:24:51.420 --> 2:24:55.900]  money keeping your crew employed? Because this crew is the most valuable thing I've got. I mean,
[2:24:55.900 --> 2:25:02.780]  people that know things and that are loyal is everything. Absolutely. I mean, you're doing
[2:25:02.780 --> 2:25:08.220]  what I'm doing on Maui and what other people are doing. I spoke before a group of wealthy
[2:25:08.220 --> 2:25:13.660]  individuals in June and I said, look, just because you're wealthy and you have a transactional based
[2:25:13.660 --> 2:25:19.420]  relationship, don't think that's going to protect you if the SHIT hits the fan. Those people are
[2:25:19.420 --> 2:25:25.740]  going to abandon you in a heartbeat. You have to have someone who's got your back because you
[2:25:25.740 --> 2:25:32.540]  have a real connection, a real human connection, and a trust and a relationship that was formed.
[2:25:32.540 --> 2:25:38.060]  That's right. This whole fake, empty, consumerist society is coming to an end and we're going to
[2:25:38.060 --> 2:25:46.620]  get back to real relationships or we're going to die. Oh, absolutely. You know, Alex, I'm very
[2:25:46.620 --> 2:25:54.460]  optimistic for the future. There's a renaissance coming and I live on Maui. It's an island community
[2:25:54.460 --> 2:26:00.060]  of 140,000 people. And over the last year, I've seen a shift in consciousness with some of my
[2:26:00.060 --> 2:26:06.780]  friends, not all, but a lot of people are starting to realize that the blue team, red team dynamic
[2:26:06.780 --> 2:26:12.220]  is nonsense, that the unvaxxed versus vaxxed is nonsense, that black versus people are starting
[2:26:12.220 --> 2:26:16.540]  to realize. By the way, don't let me, I don't want to just agree with you because it's true.
[2:26:16.540 --> 2:26:21.660]  I was in Hawaii for two weeks a few months ago and was mobbed like nowhere else, especially
[2:26:21.660 --> 2:26:27.260]  by the natives. I mean, I was in multiple islands and literally mobbed, nothing but positive.
[2:26:27.260 --> 2:26:30.780]  Everybody buying my dinner, you name it, the police pulling over and waving at me.
[2:26:32.460 --> 2:26:36.540]  Hawaii, I think because they weren't the worst lockdown, I think it forced people to wake up.
[2:26:37.980 --> 2:26:42.540]  Absolutely. And the community here is growing fast. The consciousness is taking off. So
[2:26:43.180 --> 2:26:50.060]  I am very optimistic that we've woken up enough people that even though we're going to go through
[2:26:50.060 --> 2:26:54.140]  some tough times, there's a renaissance on the other side and there's going to be a lot of new
[2:26:54.140 --> 2:26:59.500]  leaders emerging, a lot of new ideas, a lot of ways of thinking about transacting and moving
[2:26:59.500 --> 2:27:04.940]  our society forward. Clearly, the healthcare system is going to be dismantled. That's a disaster.
[2:27:04.940 --> 2:27:08.620]  All these institutions are going to be raised to the ground and have to be rebuilt.
[2:27:10.060 --> 2:27:14.300]  Exciting things are coming, but it's going to be painful, chaotic, and just don't be in fear.
[2:27:15.100 --> 2:27:17.340]  As long as you know what's going on, there's no fear.
[2:27:17.340 --> 2:27:23.740]  I agree. In closing, you have a lot of gravitas. I really respect your intellect.
[2:27:24.620 --> 2:27:27.180]  What else do you want to get across the viewers?
[2:27:30.300 --> 2:27:34.380]  Well, two things. I want to pitch my book before I go.
[2:27:34.380 --> 2:27:36.940]  Oh, yeah. Pitch the book. In fact, come back home for a full hour about it.
[2:27:36.940 --> 2:27:40.220]  Tell us about the book. I meant to do that. In fact, I apologize. The book's incredible.
[2:27:40.220 --> 2:27:48.700]  Yeah. I've just signed a contract last week with Tony Lyons of Sky Horse Publishing
[2:27:49.420 --> 2:27:57.820]  to do a book called Cause Unknown, the Epidemic of Sudden Deaths in 2021 and 2022.
[2:27:58.380 --> 2:28:02.380]  Basically, we're going to put a human face on this because we all know that
[2:28:02.380 --> 2:28:09.820]  supreme fit athletes have been dropping dead across the globe and in the US since 2021 began.
[2:28:11.180 --> 2:28:17.180]  We put cause unknown in quotes as kind of a joke because we know what the cause is,
[2:28:17.180 --> 2:28:22.380]  and my thesis is that it's the vaccine. We're going to walk people through the anecdotes,
[2:28:22.380 --> 2:28:26.940]  the personal stories, and then we're going to present the evidence and the overwhelming
[2:28:26.940 --> 2:28:31.420]  evidence at this point that something definitely has changed and is likely the vaccine.
[2:28:31.420 --> 2:28:35.900]  You don't have to agree with me, but this is a book that can be used to help convince your
[2:28:35.900 --> 2:28:39.500]  loved ones. When is Cause Unknown coming out? Because I'm going to sell it.
[2:28:41.020 --> 2:28:46.860]  It's going to be coming out in November 8th. Oh, wow. Please come back on again. Edward Dowd,

[2:32:03.420 --> 2:32:08.380]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year. 30 different
[2:32:08.380 --> 2:32:13.740]  tax returns, 30 different answers. 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers. And almost all
[2:32:13.740 --> 2:32:19.100]  of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're
[2:32:19.100 --> 2:32:23.660]  part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this. So
[2:32:23.660 --> 2:32:28.060]  it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[2:32:28.060 --> 2:32:34.380]  to be able to do things tax wise. It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your money.

[2:32:50.220 --> 2:33:04.940]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones
[2:33:04.940 --> 2:33:17.500]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's alex jones.
[2:33:20.140 --> 2:33:23.900]  Yeah, not name dropping. He's been a friend of the broadcast for many years. He's been a frequent
[2:33:23.900 --> 2:33:28.860]  guest and cohost. And I was just talking to Andrew Tater in the break. This is breaking news.
[2:33:28.860 --> 2:33:35.100]  It doesn't broke yet. YouTube just banding. So as soon as the show's over or as soon as I'm off in
[2:33:35.100 --> 2:33:40.540]  30 minutes, let me be talking to him. And they're coming after everybody that's pro human and pro
[2:33:40.540 --> 2:33:45.420]  family and pro male strength. They see males as the threat to their takeover. Of course they do
[2:33:45.420 --> 2:33:52.220]  for the soldiers, for the defenders, for the army ants. That's coming up, man. Wow. You know,
[2:33:52.220 --> 2:33:57.180]  I wanted to get to all these clips and if I set each one up, we'll never get to them all. So I've
[2:33:57.180 --> 2:34:01.740]  just got a whole string of clips here. The Tennessee House Committee on the Vax being way more
[2:34:02.940 --> 2:34:07.580]  subject to die. Just a whole bunch of these clips and I got some other economic and world news I
[2:34:07.580 --> 2:34:16.860]  want to hit. But here's a bunch of these back to back. 700,000 people in the study in Israel,
[2:34:16.860 --> 2:34:22.460]  just so you know, that showed that the double Vax were 27 times more likely to get reinfected. So
[2:34:22.460 --> 2:34:27.100]  it's not the vaccine. Even if we just talk about that is not stopping infection. It's not stopping
[2:34:27.100 --> 2:34:31.820]  transmission. If you look at the studies in England, in Scotland, in the northern countries in
[2:34:31.820 --> 2:34:35.500]  Europe, where they get real data that they're actually the triple vaccinated, the most likely
[2:34:35.500 --> 2:34:42.940]  to die. So bottom line is that as we go forward, the natural immunity is long, broad and durable.
[2:34:42.940 --> 2:34:49.820]  And I don't know if you mentioned it, but we have SARS-CoV-1 patients who still had immunity 18 years
[2:34:49.820 --> 2:34:57.500]  later. Let that sink in 18 years later, we still had immunity from SARS-CoV-1 to SARS-CoV-2.
[2:34:58.220 --> 2:35:02.700]  This is long, broad, durable immunity. So what I want to say in closing is natural
[2:35:02.700 --> 2:35:06.780]  immunity should be considered legally to be at least equal to vaccinated immunity and immunity
[2:35:06.780 --> 2:35:15.660]  is likely life. For Peter Thompson, every day is a struggle. Diagnosed with COVID in 2020,
[2:35:15.660 --> 2:35:20.700]  he's still battling. It's just over two years now and I've still got no taste or smell.
[2:35:20.700 --> 2:35:25.820]  He's one of half a million Australians with long COVID. His symptoms so severe,
[2:35:25.820 --> 2:35:31.020]  doctors have told him another bout of the virus could kill him. It's only got to take one person
[2:35:31.020 --> 2:35:39.500]  to have it and, you know, and I'm gone. Fears made even worse by the latest figures,
[2:35:39.500 --> 2:35:46.380]  showing Australia is rapidly closing in on 10 million COVID cases. More than 13,000 have died
[2:35:46.380 --> 2:35:52.300]  since the start of the pandemic. Victoria, the first state to pass 5,000 fatalities. New South
[2:35:52.300 --> 2:35:58.460]  Wales isn't far behind. In Queensland, more than 1800 people have lost their lives to the virus.
[2:35:58.460 --> 2:36:02.460]  But what the numbers say is we're simply not winning. The virus is winning.
[2:36:02.460 --> 2:36:08.060]  Warning, as we emerge from the third and worst wave this year, it's time to change the way we
[2:36:08.060 --> 2:36:13.660]  think about COVID. We haven't quite grasped the fact that having lots of virus in our community
[2:36:13.660 --> 2:36:19.580]  is bad. Professor Crabb says despite increasing third and fourth dose vaccination rates,
[2:36:19.580 --> 2:36:25.020]  the virus is constantly mutating, finding ways of getting around that immunity. And so he believes
[2:36:25.020 --> 2:36:31.260]  there needs to be a greater focus once again on limiting the spread. We have to change to reduce
[2:36:31.260 --> 2:36:41.100]  transmission. We've got to lock you down forever. We made the virus. I'm a psychotic demon. More times, a person is infected, the higher their risk of developing long COVID,
[2:36:41.100 --> 2:36:46.220]  something Peter Thompson wouldn't wish on anyone. There's places I'd love to be going,
[2:36:46.220 --> 2:37:02.140]  there's things I'd love to be seeing, but I also value my life. Rob Scott, 7 News.
[2:37:27.580 --> 2:37:34.860]  Rules for me, not for thee. I almost don't wear a mask. I make you wear a mask. It's all part of their
[2:37:34.860 --> 2:37:49.420]  religion is a total absolute scumbags. Something man, when this corona thing was going on,
[2:37:50.300 --> 2:37:55.340]  I tried to fly, I flew here from Romania on Whiz Air because you can't get first class flights
[2:37:55.340 --> 2:38:00.620]  into Europe. It's all just low cost carriers. I'm flying Whiz Air. I have a mask on. Excuse me, sir, sir,
[2:38:00.620 --> 2:38:05.500]  the mask over your nose. It's an air stewardess. It's minimum wage, bitch. So I put my mask on my
[2:38:05.500 --> 2:38:10.460]  nose. Everyone was freaking out about masks. I had to fill in all these home office papers when I
[2:38:10.460 --> 2:38:14.940]  landed all this crap, PCR test, blah, blah, blah. I thought I'm not doing that again. So about two
[2:38:14.940 --> 2:38:22.140]  months later, I flew on a private plane. No mask, no PCR test, no home office paperwork. My pilots
[2:38:22.140 --> 2:38:25.900]  weren't wearing masks. When I landed at Bigham Hill Airport, the people who met me in the BMW,
[2:38:25.900 --> 2:38:29.340]  no one was wearing a mask. Nobody had a mask on. No one asked me to fill in. Do you know why?
[2:38:29.340 --> 2:38:33.820]  Because I was rich. Corona doesn't exist for the rich people. As soon as you pay 50 grand
[2:38:33.820 --> 2:38:37.980]  for a flight, now they don't trouble you then. They trouble the shit muncher on the Whiz Air
[2:38:37.980 --> 2:38:42.780]  flight. It's all a fucking scam. All of it's a scam. And this is how the whole world has always
[2:38:42.780 --> 2:38:46.300]  worked and always will work. And people at the bottom just don't seem to get it. They don't seem
[2:38:46.300 --> 2:38:50.860]  to wake up and they don't seem to wake up because the people in charge try very hard to keep them
[2:38:50.860 --> 2:38:54.540]  asleep. If you had a whole bunch of people who were your slave, why would you tell them the
[2:38:54.540 --> 2:38:58.940]  truth about the world? Why would you do that? No. What is the last time you went to school and
[2:38:58.940 --> 2:39:04.220]  learned how money works or banks work or taxes or any of the things that they used to control you?
[2:39:04.220 --> 2:39:08.620]  No. They teach you about the synthesis. They don't want you to know anything. They don't want us to
[2:39:08.620 --> 2:39:13.740]  know anything. They just want us sitting there going, okay, he's a panda and I stay in my house
[2:39:13.740 --> 2:39:20.780]  because of Corona. Clap for the NHS. Like a performing seal. Look at an idiot. And people are
[2:39:20.780 --> 2:39:25.580]  idiots. So they control them. And then they come to me and go, Tate, how'd you make all this money?
[2:39:25.580 --> 2:39:31.740]  I opened my fucking eyes. I looked around me. I started to think things that people never seem
[2:39:31.740 --> 2:39:38.220]  to do. I don't know how they live in a dream for so long. I woke up out of the dream, right?
[2:39:38.220 --> 2:39:41.340]  But this is the truth. Governments are absolutely the enemy of the people. They always happen. They
[2:39:41.340 --> 2:39:46.940]  always will be. All of them. And that's why he's been banned. I just talked to Andrew during the
[2:39:46.940 --> 2:39:50.700]  break. He was just banned on YouTube and more is about to kind of be talking to him as soon as the
[2:39:50.700 --> 2:39:58.060]  show ends or my hour in 20 minutes. Big developments there. But it's because we're popular. See,
[2:39:58.060 --> 2:40:03.180]  America wasn't perfect. But why did everybody want to come here? Why did America at the end
[2:40:03.180 --> 2:40:08.620]  of World War II have half the wealth of the world till the 1960s? 4% of the world's population.
[2:40:08.620 --> 2:40:17.740]  More than 96% of the world, we had the wealth. 4% of the world's population
[2:40:17.740 --> 2:40:26.460]  had more than half the wealth. Because America and our founders, they weren't perfect, but they
[2:40:26.460 --> 2:40:30.380]  were great compared to everybody else said, hey, let's turn everybody loose and let everybody
[2:40:30.380 --> 2:40:36.060]  become successful and see what happens. And you see what happens. Cars and space shuttles and
[2:40:36.060 --> 2:40:43.260]  electricity and medicine. But now it's all been infested and taken over. I want you to know the
[2:40:43.260 --> 2:40:47.180]  tricks they've got. I want you to know about the private Federal Reserve. I want you to know about
[2:40:47.180 --> 2:40:54.140]  what they're up to. Because man, I'm into humans. When I see people getting screwed over, I get
[2:40:54.140 --> 2:41:00.620]  pissed. See, I'm so confident that I think in a rising tide that raises all ships, if John F.
[2:41:00.620 --> 2:41:06.780]  Kennedy said that, I think I'm going to be one of the biggest ships. I don't want to rule a big
[2:41:06.780 --> 2:41:13.100]  pile of manure. I don't want to be sitting on top of pile of skulls. I want to be sitting on top of
[2:41:13.100 --> 2:41:21.180]  you having a bad ass future and hailing me. And I'm hailing you. The globalists think I'm sick
[2:41:22.540 --> 2:41:26.940]  because I believe in you. And I know we have unlimited resources and can go interplanetary
[2:41:28.380 --> 2:41:37.020]  anytime we want. And I'm ready for that. You see, I feel bound to you. And when you're not
[2:41:37.020 --> 2:41:44.220]  successful, I feel like a pile of crap. When you're successful, I feel empowered. As you can have
[2:41:44.220 --> 2:41:48.860]  anything you want, like the Guns N' Roses song says, you just better not take it from me.
[2:41:51.340 --> 2:41:54.780]  And to a parasite, they hear that and they go, well, we better take it away from somebody.
[2:41:54.780 --> 2:42:01.020]  No, no, it's a non-zero sum game. It's a win-win. It's a 360 win, the term I coined. It's unlimited,
[2:42:01.020 --> 2:42:06.860]  folks. The resources we have now is billions of times 100 years ago. We'll be billions of time
[2:42:06.860 --> 2:42:11.740]  that. Our only problem is the decadence that comes from all this success. I mean, God's just
[2:42:11.740 --> 2:42:16.540]  giving us the universe and giving us everything and giving us this intellect.
[2:42:23.980 --> 2:42:26.860]  These people want to cut your power off. They want to screw you and your family.
[2:42:27.420 --> 2:42:35.980]  I don't. And I'm not a hero. I'm a selfish son of a bitch. And I want you to be so damn wealthy,
[2:42:35.980 --> 2:42:41.100]  a big giant wave of success I roll into. And I actually want you to succeed as well. I'm not
[2:42:41.100 --> 2:42:45.980]  going to have to get you. But that's because I'm spiritually with God. But if I actually pulled
[2:42:45.980 --> 2:42:51.660]  back, if I was a smart sociopath, I'd go, you being successful is good. But these people aren't smart.
[2:42:51.660 --> 2:43:07.660]  They're evil. Well, they're right back. Stay with us.

[2:47:12.300 --> 2:47:16.140]  It's never going to get any better. Don't look for it. Be happy with what you got.
[2:47:16.140 --> 2:47:22.860]  Because the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now.
[2:47:22.860 --> 2:47:28.140]  The real owners, the big wealthy business and just to control things and make all the important
[2:47:28.140 --> 2:47:32.860]  decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have
[2:47:32.860 --> 2:47:42.780]  freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything.
[2:47:42.780 --> 2:47:47.500]  They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They've long since bought
[2:47:47.500 --> 2:47:50.940]  and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses and city halls. They got the judges in
[2:47:50.940 --> 2:47:55.340]  their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the
[2:47:55.340 --> 2:48:02.620]  news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. They want obedient workers.
[2:48:02.620 --> 2:48:07.820]  Obedient workers. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork
[2:48:07.820 --> 2:48:12.780]  and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours to reduce
[2:48:12.780 --> 2:48:16.860]  benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to
[2:48:16.860 --> 2:48:21.900]  collect it. And now they're coming for your social security money so they can give it to
[2:48:21.900 --> 2:48:28.940]  their criminal friends on Wall Street. It's a big club and you ain't in it. You said recently,
[2:48:28.940 --> 2:48:34.860]  quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do. You better believe it. So
[2:48:34.860 --> 2:48:40.380]  what specifically did they do? If I ask them, if I need them, most of the people on this stage
[2:48:40.380 --> 2:48:46.860]  I've given to just so you understand. A lot of money. You and I are not in the big club. The
[2:48:46.860 --> 2:48:52.460]  owners of this country know the truth. It's called the American dream because you have to be asleep
[2:48:52.460 --> 2:48:58.540]  to believe it. But I'll tell you what they don't want. They don't want a population of citizens
[2:48:58.540 --> 2:49:02.940]  capable of critical thinking. They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable
[2:49:02.940 --> 2:49:06.940]  of critical thinking. They're not interested in that. That doesn't help them. That's against
[2:49:06.940 --> 2:49:13.740]  their interest. That's right. From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:49:15.660 --> 2:49:20.140]  So that's where we are. And I mean, I'm going to tell you a point blank. I'm not bragging. It's
[2:49:20.140 --> 2:49:27.740]  just true. I literally believe in humanity. I love you whether you're brown or black or white or pink.
[2:49:27.740 --> 2:49:33.420]  I love you whether you're a man or a woman. I just believe in our people. And that's why the
[2:49:33.420 --> 2:49:39.820]  enemies of humanity hate me so much is because I'm not with them. I don't want to join their
[2:49:39.820 --> 2:49:46.220]  parasitic operation, but I'll tell you right now. I can't take these people on without you.
[2:49:47.100 --> 2:49:52.060]  I am your champion. And haven't we proven it? And I'll just be point blank with you.
[2:49:52.060 --> 2:49:59.340]  Point blank with you. I need your support. I need your psychic energy. I need your prayer.
[2:50:00.540 --> 2:50:06.700]  I need your word of mouth and I need your money. I have put myself right in the crucible. And by
[2:50:06.700 --> 2:50:10.860]  the way, it's been a blessing and I'm thankful to do it. I'm not a victim. I ask for this. I'm so
[2:50:10.860 --> 2:50:19.100]  happy, but I want to win. And you've been doing it. And I salute you, but just go to infowarstore.com.
[2:50:19.100 --> 2:50:23.180]  Get DNA force, get supermodel vitality, get body's ultimate tumor formula, get vitamin
[2:50:23.180 --> 2:50:29.340]  refusion for itself. Get a copy of the Great Reset. I mean, we could probably finance a whole
[2:50:29.340 --> 2:50:34.460]  operation on signed books, except we're up to 10,000 signed books. We're going to the black
[2:50:34.460 --> 2:50:38.540]  right now, but I can't say I'm going to sign these when I'm not. I got to stop soon.
[2:50:40.540 --> 2:50:45.500]  So it's the tale of two cities, folks. It's the best of times. It's the worst of times.
[2:50:45.500 --> 2:50:51.500]  But I've literally rolled up my sleeves to fight these people. And I believe in you.
[2:50:52.860 --> 2:50:58.300]  And I just need you to energize us as your champions in this fight. Because this is some
[2:50:58.300 --> 2:51:02.220]  baseball game that doesn't matter. Football game that doesn't matter. I'm not bashing. We love
[2:51:02.220 --> 2:51:06.780]  football or baseball or basketball. Boy, I love it too. Well, if any good game, but those games
[2:51:06.780 --> 2:51:13.100]  don't matter. This is the real fight. You'll go spend hundreds of dollars on a UFC ticket or
[2:51:13.100 --> 2:51:18.700]  hundreds of dollars on an NBA ticket. And all I'm saying is, okay, great, but you better double down
[2:51:18.700 --> 2:51:25.340]  here because, man, I'm swinging for the fences. And I wish I knew how dire the situation was
[2:51:25.340 --> 2:51:32.460]  the last few years. I knew it was bad, but I got lackadaisical. I didn't focus on things. I
[2:51:32.460 --> 2:51:37.180]  didn't focus on bringing in money. We almost went bankrupt. I mean, we were in bankruptcy, but
[2:51:37.180 --> 2:51:41.980]  if we hadn't gotten that $8 million donation in Bitcoin, by the time we cashed out a little bit
[2:51:41.980 --> 2:51:45.900]  less than $8 million, when we came in, it was like $9 million, but I waited to see if it go up and
[2:51:45.900 --> 2:51:53.100]  went down. Whoever that person is saved us because I didn't know we were, we weren't $3 million behind.
[2:51:55.260 --> 2:52:05.980]  We were $6 million behind. We were insolvent. My accountant told me right after we paid off
[2:52:05.980 --> 2:52:14.700]  the debts of $6 million, and we bought $2 million a product. That's now coming in. But if we were
[2:52:14.700 --> 2:52:19.260]  good stewards of that, we can continue to be on air. You talk about God working in mysterious ways.
[2:52:19.260 --> 2:52:26.540]  I mean, if you don't know there's a God, who is this unknown donor that literally knew my finance
[2:52:26.540 --> 2:52:32.460]  is better than me and gave us exactly the amount that if we played the cards exactly right?
[2:52:32.460 --> 2:52:42.140]  But that's how God works. I was sitting there with $5 million four years ago as our emergency
[2:52:42.140 --> 2:52:47.420]  backup money for an operation like this. That's nothing. And I'm sitting there with it, sitting
[2:52:47.420 --> 2:52:52.620]  in a Mech account, and I go, what do I do? And literally God goes, get a real estate agent,
[2:52:53.340 --> 2:52:57.340]  buy an elite part of Austin, real estate's going to go up a few years, sell it. I sold right at
[2:52:57.340 --> 2:53:04.220]  the top of the market. And for the time before that Bitcoin money came in, it was the money of that
[2:53:04.220 --> 2:53:11.420]  house sale. Put back directly into this operation. The house doubled in value in three years.
[2:53:12.620 --> 2:53:17.500]  Big, beautiful, fancy modern house. I couldn't stand it. My wife loved it. She got pissed when
[2:53:17.500 --> 2:53:23.980]  I sold it. But the point is, is that that kept us on air. That was God working through me with
[2:53:23.980 --> 2:53:27.660]  a good decision. And then that Bitcoin donation. Now the products are coming back in and you're
[2:53:27.660 --> 2:53:32.140]  funding us and we're still here and they can't stand it. They have big show trials, thousands of
[2:53:32.140 --> 2:53:36.380]  articles, hundreds of TV programs. That's conservatively thousands of TV programs, hundreds
[2:53:36.380 --> 2:53:42.300]  of thousands of articles. And now you've seen it like they're going to invade a country lying about
[2:53:42.300 --> 2:53:47.340]  us just to tame a jury to try to win a lawsuit to shut us down. They're not going to shut anything
[2:53:47.340 --> 2:53:54.300]  down. I can walk across the street and fire up a podcast that reaches the same amount of people today.
[2:53:55.900 --> 2:54:00.860]  But you won't have the Derrimick Greens and the Greg Reese's and all these incredible
[2:54:00.860 --> 2:54:06.700]  Adon Salazar's and the Kit Daniels and everybody else that writes the articles and reports and
[2:54:06.700 --> 2:54:13.260]  does all this other amazing stuff. We don't want them to shut us down or slow us down any level.
[2:54:13.260 --> 2:54:18.460]  And you can end their power over us right now. You can shut their asses down by financially
[2:54:18.460 --> 2:54:23.900]  supporting us at infowarstore.com. And again, I want to explain there's 20 plus types of bankruptcies
[2:54:23.900 --> 2:54:28.140]  in America and listeners hear this and family calls me and says too bad you're shutting down.
[2:54:28.140 --> 2:54:32.540]  And I explain to them, I go, listen, and always I do this again. It's because listeners still don't
[2:54:32.540 --> 2:54:40.140]  know what I want you to know. We're in chapter five bankruptcy, which is emergency reorganization
[2:54:40.140 --> 2:54:44.380]  reorganization for a business. And it's a business that funds this operation.
[2:54:45.820 --> 2:54:51.580]  And then under federal law, their goal to shut us down with these judgments won't work because
[2:54:51.580 --> 2:54:56.380]  the federal court will look at the actual money we have and the real numbers not the made up
[2:54:56.380 --> 2:55:01.020]  hundreds of millions they fraud frauds we say we have. And then whatever we actually have extra
[2:55:01.020 --> 2:55:07.260]  they get. But all the crews stays in place and all the operations stay in place. Just Alex Jones
[2:55:07.260 --> 2:55:13.660]  doesn't get money, which is fine with me. I didn't get into this for money. Money is nice, but I
[2:55:13.660 --> 2:55:22.300]  don't give a damn money on a scale of 100s like a two fighting tyranny is 100%. It's what I live for.
[2:55:23.660 --> 2:55:25.580]  So all I asked is you keep us in the fight
[2:55:27.980 --> 2:55:34.860]  and understand that I'm not going to be stopped. And we got a lot of other irons of the fires
[2:55:34.860 --> 2:55:40.620]  and a lot of big cavalry coming to the aid. And if you think you've seen something from M4 Wars now.
[2:55:44.540 --> 2:55:52.300]  I am so fired up right now. I am I am next level. And the Holy Spirit is so strong with me right
[2:55:52.300 --> 2:55:56.300]  now. The force is so strong here right now. It's insane. And it's all your prayers that are doing
[2:55:56.300 --> 2:56:02.620]  it. And so I want to thank you. But just commit like you've done in the past and get a t shirt
[2:56:02.620 --> 2:56:09.420]  at info wars.com, get DNA force, get bodies, get our great immune support, get ultra 12, get X2,
[2:56:09.420 --> 2:56:14.540]  get super metal vitality finally back in stock and know that you are literally in an arm wrestling
[2:56:14.540 --> 2:56:23.740]  contest with Satan. And all I am is the arm. Info Wars is the arm. I got a strong arm and a strong
[2:56:23.740 --> 2:56:30.140]  will, but the power to hold it in position is you. So when I'm struggling, you're struggling when I'm
[2:56:30.140 --> 2:56:34.700]  in combat with these people and they're doing everything they can. It's much easier to just
[2:56:34.700 --> 2:56:38.860]  stop sitting here to still make with them. And for you to just to get behind us, pray tonight
[2:56:38.860 --> 2:56:43.820]  for us, pray tomorrow for us, spread the word about us by the products. And I'm telling you,
[2:56:44.540 --> 2:56:50.540]  we're going to slam their hand down. We're going to beat their ass. I smell nothing but victory.
[2:56:53.180 --> 2:57:00.060]  I'm not a victory. But the spirit I got right here is victory. And I have never felt better
[2:57:00.060 --> 2:57:06.940]  I have never felt stronger because of you. Because God works through souls and you've done it and
[2:57:06.940 --> 2:57:11.820]  you've you've you've done incredible things. And we're going to do this together. Think about it.
[2:57:11.820 --> 2:57:16.060]  We're the number one enemy. We're who the enemy hates more than anybody. Why is that? Because I'm
[2:57:16.060 --> 2:57:23.980]  real and you're real. And together we create a energy loop, a synergy and an amplifying network
[2:57:23.980 --> 2:57:28.860]  of goodness. Just like they wanted to shut down the churches during lockdown. Because there were
[2:57:28.860 --> 2:57:36.060]  good people coming together and we're we're doing it now together. So go to infowarstore.com
[2:57:36.060 --> 2:57:40.460]  and get great products. Sign up for all of us. You get 10% off. But whatever you do,
[2:57:40.460 --> 2:57:59.260]  spread the word about the broadcast. I got some final news to hit. The cavalry for your immune system, the cavalry for your health, and the cavalry to keep info wars on the air with funding has now arrived a 360 win.
[2:57:59.980 --> 2:58:08.220]  Almost sold out for a year. DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ10 and all the patented documented

[2:58:15.980 --> 2:58:28.940]  And despite the fact it's going to sell out quick, I want those of you that haven't experienced it to get it. And I want long term supporters to experience it as well. So it is 50% off out of the gates for a limited time.

[2:58:46.460 --> 2:59:04.140]  Alex Jones expanded his broadcast by selling a line of products focused on healing from the toxic world of a corrupt system, which has allowed info wars to remain a free public broadcast to combat the dangerous lies of the mainstream media.
[2:59:04.140 --> 2:59:26.380]  Alex Jones is patient zero for alternative facts. Do you understand what I have said? Yes, I believe what I said was true. Yes, you believe everything you say is true, but it isn't. Your beliefs do not make something true. That is what we're doing here.
[2:59:26.380 --> 2:59:45.340]  There's going to be a large set of planets who are going to be dividing up the corpse of info wars in the bankruptcy estate. The info wars audience has mobilized and awakened the world to the threat that is globalism. And with your continued support, we will keep going. Join us now and support the info war.
[2:59:45.340 --> 2:59:54.940]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:00:35.100 --> 3:00:45.100]  So all those doubting my NFT, you're looking at the guy. That's the reason that college athletes and high school athletes are getting paid today.
[3:00:45.100 --> 3:01:03.500]  Mr. Influencer, the influencers. Secondly, Jimmy Kimmel viral this. I fight to eradicate childhood malnutrition from the planet. And until they released the flight logs, you, the mainstream media, Hollywood, for all pedophiles to me, eat.
[3:01:03.500 --> 3:01:23.500]  Everybody gets us a rebellion against the pedophiles. Stephen Colbert flew on the pedophile flights. The head of Atlantic Monthly, all of.
[3:01:23.500 --> 3:01:33.500]  Everybody knows who you are, parasites. We got your number. So keep pushing us around. Keep bullying us. Keep playing your games.
[3:01:33.500 --> 3:01:57.500]  You have that little promo from the court hearing where they say, are you claiming the government's running kids? And I say, you mean like Bill Clinton, Jeffrey Epstein or Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton. They cannot stand against us when we start speaking out, whether you're a UFC champ or a school teacher, whether you're an auto mechanic or a police officer.
[3:01:57.500 --> 3:02:09.500]  Stop submitting. Stop being bullied. I go out in public. I'll shake 20 hands before somebody says, F. U. Alex Jones, I hate you. And I'll be sitting there eating the dinner when they come over and yell at me at my dinner.
[3:02:09.500 --> 3:02:33.500]  You can't believe you're out in public. Aren't you ashamed? I go, not on a shame scum like you that like me. This food is so much better now because I am done rolling over. I am done bowing to the scum. They're trash who have nothing that bully us and we continue to submit to them.
[3:02:33.500 --> 3:02:49.500]  At a certain point, we got to stop kneeling. At a certain point, we got to stop bowing. At a certain point, we've got to stop submitting. We got to come up for air and say, I'm done with the new world order.
[3:02:49.500 --> 3:03:05.500]  You have the clip. Here it is. One of the things you've been talking about on your show is your allegation that government officials are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking and the grooming of children.
[3:03:05.500 --> 3:03:21.500]  What do you mean, like, whatever Epstein did with the cleanse? This is not 15 million views. Bigger than your host, y'all. Bye-bye.
[3:03:21.500 --> 3:03:35.500]  Your allegation that government officials are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking and the grooming of children.
[3:03:35.500 --> 3:03:52.500]  What do you mean, like, what Jeffrey Epstein did with the cleanse? They're failing. They're falling. They don't know what to do. They spent years rigging these court cases.
[3:03:52.500 --> 3:04:05.500]  They spent tens of thousands, conservatively, of articles, thousands of TV shows trying to taint a jury, rig jury questions, all of it, all to try to think some made-up verdict of 40-something million dollars.
[3:04:05.500 --> 3:04:18.500]  We don't have two million dollars. It's going to beat us. It's a joke. We're winning. They're losing. They're the little men behind the curtain.
[3:04:18.500 --> 3:04:28.500]  Gerald Salente, the trans forecast, one of my good friends, has always loaded for bear. He's about to take over, and then in one hour, Owen Schreuer in the war room.
[3:04:28.500 --> 3:04:37.500]  Remember when you asked, why didn't people battle tyranny? Why didn't people stand up? We are. You are. By listening and viewing, I cannot thank you enough.

[3:06:22.500 --> 3:06:31.500]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show. Thank you so much and thank everyone and the staff for all that you do.
[3:06:31.500 --> 3:06:41.500]  And we're in critical times right now. The markets are going way down. We'll talk about that in a bit. But Alex had mentioned Bill Clinton.
[3:06:41.500 --> 3:06:52.500]  This is a t-shirt. You can see that. This is a t-shirt that I did back when he was running. He wears slick willy.
[3:06:52.500 --> 3:07:06.500]  Yep. Here he is. Slick willy. Here is another one we did. This is when he became president.
[3:07:06.500 --> 3:07:17.500]  That's it. A mobster gangster murderous little lowlife piece of scum garbage crap.
[3:07:17.500 --> 3:07:29.500]  Yep. One after another. One after another. These lowlives are ruining our lives.
[3:07:29.500 --> 3:07:35.500]  It's a crime syndicate that morons and imbeciles call a government.
[3:07:35.500 --> 3:07:47.500]  This is the scum boy that gave us naff that had sent our jobs to Mexico for cheap labor.
[3:07:47.500 --> 3:07:55.500]  This is the scum boy that allowed the drug dealers to run their ads on TV.
[3:07:55.500 --> 3:08:01.500]  Oh, a big farmer. I forgot. Oh, I got to be proper. Big farmer. And that's the other thing.
[3:08:01.500 --> 3:08:11.500]  Oh, you know, Mr. Solanti, we'd like you a lot more if you'd lower your voice and stop using those curse words and vulgar words.
[3:08:11.500 --> 3:08:28.500]  Get to sit in your head, little boys and girls. When you're in a fight, you don't say, oh, please put that knife or gun away or that stick that you're holding and don't hit me.
[3:08:28.500 --> 3:08:38.500]  You fight. And we're in the fight for our lives. Let me tell you what vulgarity is.
[3:08:38.500 --> 3:08:57.500]  Vulgarity is the crap that these little boys and girls, prostitutes, media whores, little janky kappa, Danny Lemon, one little clown after another with arrogant attitudes.
[3:08:57.500 --> 3:09:15.500]  And they write articles and spew out the crap. The United States is sending $785 million in military aid to Ukraine.
[3:09:15.500 --> 3:09:30.500]  That is vulgarity. Military aid? Why, you little boys and girls? That is vulgarity.
[3:09:30.500 --> 3:09:48.500]  It is in aid. It is murder, morons. Murderous weapons to keep killing people and to keep bloodying the killing fields. Jerks.
[3:09:48.500 --> 3:10:00.500]  Oh, calm down, Selenity. If you would only say it the way they say it, we would swallow their garbage and we hate you because you won't swallow it.
[3:10:00.500 --> 3:10:10.500]  Same reason they don't like Alex Jones. Why, how dare you not swallow the crap that I love to swallow?
[3:10:10.500 --> 3:10:21.500]  Get this in your head, everybody. I'm an American. Proud to be an American.
[3:10:21.500 --> 3:10:32.500]  Yep. I live by the founding fathers, no foreign entanglements. I've read to you time in and time out.
[3:10:32.500 --> 3:10:42.500]  All of those little reports that we have here from George Washington telling the American people not to get involved in foreign entanglements.
[3:10:42.500 --> 3:10:55.500]  It's none of our business. Word after word. If you love a nation, you hate a nation, you become a slave to them.
[3:10:55.500 --> 3:11:06.500]  Military aid. What does Russian Ukraine have to do with my, you know, saving me as an American has nothing to do with me.
[3:11:06.500 --> 3:11:16.500]  This is against everything going on. So here's the deal. And here's your cover of this week's Trends Journal. It's going out tomorrow.
[3:11:16.500 --> 3:11:29.500]  Support war. Support Satan. That's to cover your magazine.
[3:11:29.500 --> 3:11:51.500]  If you support war, you support Satan. The God that you believe in. Here we go. Support war. Support Satan.
[3:11:51.500 --> 3:12:07.500]  What God supports war. This is satanic. God doesn't support war. Only Satan does.
[3:12:07.500 --> 3:12:19.500]  And that's who's running the show. We have satanic people. How many times was Clinton on that plane with that pedophile guy?
[3:12:19.500 --> 3:12:27.500]  Oh, did he hung himself? Epstein? Oh, yeah, sure he did. Yeah.
[3:12:27.500 --> 3:12:40.500]  And Mary had a little lamb. Yeah. She was white as snow and everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.
[3:12:40.500 --> 3:12:50.500]  Why do you think they pay a Clinton as I was saying before three or $400,000 to give a one hour talk? He killed NAFTA.
[3:12:50.500 --> 3:12:59.500]  Let the drug dealers put their ads on TV. Get away with the Glass-Steagall accident. Banks to gangsters can become bigger.
[3:12:59.500 --> 3:13:17.500]  You like the Yugoslav war? No, I know. You like the 500,000 children he killed in Iraq by putting sanctions on him. Every time he got down, caught with his pants down, his bombs away over Baghdad.
[3:13:17.500 --> 3:13:23.500]  Bill Clinton. What do you think they pay him this kind of money for?
[3:13:23.500 --> 3:13:30.500]  You get your BS for free all day long, that arrogant little boy.
[3:13:30.500 --> 3:13:38.500]  We are in the fight for our lives and they're going to do everything they can to silence us.
[3:13:38.500 --> 3:13:49.500]  They did that hit piece on Dr. Joseph McCullough in the toilet paper record in the New York Times where McCullough answered them.
[3:13:49.500 --> 3:13:57.500]  You can't come close to that man. Well, he didn't believe in the Operation Warp Speed Gene Therapy Vax.
[3:13:57.500 --> 3:14:10.500]  He has the videos up there of Biden and Fauci in one after another saying how if you got the Vax, you'd be okay.
[3:14:10.500 --> 3:14:15.500]  It wouldn't hurt you. Did it help you?
[3:14:15.500 --> 3:14:20.500]  The only people I know that got vaccinated that got the virus?
[3:14:20.500 --> 3:14:26.500]  Oh, including that clown Jimmy Kimmel that they were talking about. Yeah, that arrogant little comedian.
[3:14:26.500 --> 3:14:37.500]  All these little comedians telling you to take a vaccination. All these actors, comics, murderers.
[3:14:37.500 --> 3:14:46.500]  And boy, they get angry at you when you won't swallow their crap. How dare you not swallow my crap.
[3:14:46.500 --> 3:14:55.500]  I'm not an American. I bow down to dictators and little boys and girls.
[3:14:55.500 --> 3:15:06.500]  I like having news. I like Andy Cuomo. Give me witness with me. How about the wine?
[3:15:06.500 --> 3:15:15.500]  You may as your governor's sellouts. You're not Americans.
[3:15:15.500 --> 3:15:25.500]  The founding fathers would be disgusted with you. Matter of fact, you'd bow down to the Brits.
[3:15:25.500 --> 3:15:34.500]  And even suck up to a guy like Boris Johnson. Hey, where's that clown these days?
[3:15:34.500 --> 3:15:41.500]  It's a freak show. It's a freak show. And you got to do something to stop it.
[3:15:41.500 --> 3:15:48.500]  So support info wars. Do everything you can. We are in the times of our lives.
[3:15:48.500 --> 3:15:52.500]  We come back. We're going to talk about the economy, where it's going and what's next.
[3:15:52.500 --> 3:15:57.500]  We're into rough, rough time. Stay tuned.
[3:15:57.500 --> 3:16:05.500]  We brought the game-changing product, previously only available to major oil companies around the world.
[3:16:05.500 --> 3:16:11.500]  For septic tanks, for port-a-potties, for RVs, for your drains, your boats, it goes on and on.
[3:16:11.500 --> 3:16:14.500]  It'll eat the oil off of your driveway if you just add water.
[3:16:14.500 --> 3:16:21.500]  But it's been so successful now, we're selling it to major RV parks, pig farms, you name it.
[3:16:21.500 --> 3:16:30.500]  Because this stuff will eat anything that is organic. And it's exclusively available at thebiopros.com
[3:16:30.500 --> 3:16:36.500]  and now infowars.com. We sold out of this for almost a year, but we made a major purchase.
[3:16:36.500 --> 3:16:41.500]  And it is now in stock for whatever your need is at infowars.com.
[3:16:41.500 --> 3:16:47.500]  You'll also find instructional videos and more information at infowars.com or thebiopros.com.
[3:16:47.500 --> 3:16:54.500]  Made America, powered by God's great creation. It is amazing and it funds the info war.
[3:17:20.500 --> 3:17:25.500]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[3:17:25.500 --> 3:17:31.500]  I'm going to wake up today, you know what, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer.
[3:17:31.500 --> 3:17:33.500]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[3:17:33.500 --> 3:17:37.500]  I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[3:17:37.500 --> 3:17:40.500]  Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way?
[3:17:40.500 --> 3:17:43.500]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[3:17:43.500 --> 3:17:47.500]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health.
[3:17:47.500 --> 3:17:51.500]  And that's why you need to go to infowars.com, take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[3:17:51.500 --> 3:17:54.500]  Don't buy into the group, think, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the turbo force.
[3:17:54.500 --> 3:18:18.500]  Kool-Aid's bad and the turbo force is good.

[3:42:16.500 --> 3:42:38.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:42:38.500 --> 3:43:06.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:43:06.500 --> 3:43:28.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:43:28.500 --> 3:43:56.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:43:56.500 --> 3:44:16.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:44:16.500 --> 3:44:44.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:44:44.500 --> 3:44:56.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:44:56.500 --> 3:45:22.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:45:22.500 --> 3:45:38.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:45:38.500 --> 3:45:58.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:45:58.500 --> 3:46:18.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:46:18.500 --> 3:46:38.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:46:38.500 --> 3:47:04.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:47:04.500 --> 3:47:26.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:47:26.500 --> 3:47:52.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:47:52.500 --> 3:48:14.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:48:14.500 --> 3:48:42.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:48:42.500 --> 3:49:08.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:49:08.500 --> 3:49:30.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:49:30.500 --> 3:49:58.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:49:58.500 --> 3:50:26.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:50:26.500 --> 3:50:48.500]  The Kool-Aid is good.
[3:50:48.500 --> 3:51:04.500]  The inflation rate in Europe, I forgot exactly what it is, is either 8.6 or 8.9%.
[3:51:04.500 --> 3:51:08.500]  Their interest rate is only 0%.
[3:51:08.500 --> 3:51:12.500]  0% interest rate.
[3:51:12.500 --> 3:51:18.500]  They make fun of Turkey for lowering their interest rates as inflation goes up when they've done the same thing.
[3:51:18.500 --> 3:51:30.500]  Mexico has, they're looking at a 10% annual inflation rate, their interest rate is 8.5%.
[3:51:30.500 --> 3:51:44.500]  Now remember I said, the euro is at parity with the dollar. That means that inflation is going higher.
[3:51:44.500 --> 3:51:46.500]  It's costing you more to buy things.
[3:51:46.500 --> 3:51:50.500]  So the markets in the United States are down.
[3:51:50.500 --> 3:51:52.500]  The dollar is up.
[3:51:52.500 --> 3:51:58.500]  But oil prices are still staying high. They're at $96 a barrel for Brent Crude.
[3:51:58.500 --> 3:52:16.500]  So when you put it all together and then because of the sanctions that the imbeciles beginning with Joe B.S. Biden and then the rest of the Europeans put on the Russians, the gas prices are spiking.
[3:52:16.500 --> 3:52:20.500]  Today they hit another, you know, your record high.
[3:52:20.500 --> 3:52:30.500]  So now as it's costing you more to buy a lot less, this is dragflation.
[3:52:30.500 --> 3:52:38.500]  But I guess they won't allow us to say it because you can't use the word drag, you know, just like you can't say gay to feel happy.
[3:52:38.500 --> 3:52:46.500]  Like I can't care who anybody was. I got a load of friends, you know, gay straight upside down inside out to take it easy.
[3:52:46.500 --> 3:52:59.500]  But this BS, we have sent out tens of thousands of press releases saying this is not stagflation, it's dragflation, and the media refuses to report it.
[3:52:59.500 --> 3:53:08.500]  Economies are dragging down as inflation is going up. The facts are there. I'm not making this up.
[3:53:08.500 --> 3:53:15.500]  You have inflation spiking as GDPs are declining.
[3:53:15.500 --> 3:53:27.500]  And the EU, your UK, where they put an F and a U and a C, whatever you want to throw into it because of the clowns running it, that UK over there,
[3:53:27.500 --> 3:53:36.500]  they got a 10%, they're looking at 10% inflation rate, and they only have an interest rate of 1.75%.
[3:53:36.500 --> 3:53:42.500]  And the fuel prices, they're escalating as well because of the sanctions they put on.
[3:53:42.500 --> 3:53:52.500]  We are in the midst of the worst market crash and economic volatility in modern history.
[3:53:52.500 --> 3:54:06.500]  And with all those fails, they take you to war. They're saying that the Russians are bombing this Ukrainian plant, nuclear power plant that they're in charge of, that all their troops are in.
[3:54:06.500 --> 3:54:12.500]  Why would they bomb a place that they're in? Ukrainians are doing it.
[3:54:12.500 --> 3:54:24.500]  As I said, World War I won't, World War I, World War III won't become official until there's a major attack, be it false flag, nuclear, whatever.
[3:54:24.500 --> 3:54:36.500]  Just like they say Pearl Harbor started World War II, and by the way, 80% of the Americans were against getting involved in World War II before Pearl Harbor.
[3:54:36.500 --> 3:54:39.500]  Same thing with World War I.
[3:54:39.500 --> 3:54:54.500]  What's the difference? It's all a bunch of belong.
[3:54:54.500 --> 3:55:01.500]  Oh, and how about that Prime Minister of Finland? Oh, how she talks so serious like this, and then she's, you know, yeah.
[3:55:01.500 --> 3:55:09.500]  The freak show, like that Gavin Newsom, the arrogant little boy that they're going to, looks like they're going to run for the demo craps.
[3:55:09.500 --> 3:55:18.500]  The president locks down everybody while he's up at the French laundry, eating like $300, $400 plate dinners.
[3:55:18.500 --> 3:55:21.500]  Yep.
[3:55:21.500 --> 3:55:28.500]  So going back to the economy, this thing's going to go down big, it's going to go down hard, and it's going to go down fast when we start people on vacation.
[3:55:28.500 --> 3:55:31.500]  Now we're going to get two weeks of quietness.
[3:55:31.500 --> 3:55:35.500]  The markets could go berserk, but they're not trading very heavy now.
[3:55:35.500 --> 3:55:47.500]  This is the last week of August is the slowest week of the year in terms of news and everything, because people are winding out in summer, and then you have Labor Day weekends.
[3:55:47.500 --> 3:55:50.500]  There's going to be two weeks of quietness in there.
[3:55:50.500 --> 3:55:52.500]  And then the reality is going to hit.
[3:55:52.500 --> 3:56:12.500]  I got this mail from city group from city earn up to $3,500 when you open a city saving account.
[3:56:12.500 --> 3:56:22.500]  Let's see if I put in 10 to $30,000, I earned the grand total of 40 bucks.
[3:56:22.500 --> 3:56:32.500]  If I put in 100,000 to 200,000 or 199,999, I earned the grand total of $400.
[3:56:32.500 --> 3:56:37.500]  You got to put in a million bucks to earn $3,500.
[3:56:37.500 --> 3:56:39.500]  All right.
[3:56:39.500 --> 3:56:43.500]  And then I rigged the game is a million bucks.
[3:56:43.500 --> 3:56:48.500]  Once upon a time when I was a young man, they had things called interest rates.
[3:56:48.500 --> 3:56:54.500]  And when you put money in the bank, you used to get interest on it.
[3:56:54.500 --> 3:56:59.500]  No more with plantation workers of slave landia.
[3:56:59.500 --> 3:57:03.500]  And if we don't reverse it, World War three has begun.
[3:57:03.500 --> 3:57:08.500]  The crime rates are escalating all over the place.
[3:57:08.500 --> 3:57:12.500]  Ukraine was going to bring us into World War three if we don't stop it.
[3:57:12.500 --> 3:57:22.500]  And as the cover of the trends journal for this week coming up, if you support war, you support Satan.
[3:57:22.500 --> 3:57:24.500]  And by the way, I'm not a pacifist.
[3:57:24.500 --> 3:57:32.500]  I'm a fighter, a black belt, close combat, martial artist.
[3:57:32.500 --> 3:57:37.500]  I only attack the attacker.
[3:57:37.500 --> 3:57:41.500]  So we have to unite for peace.
[3:57:41.500 --> 3:57:43.500]  Why did we stand?
[3:57:43.500 --> 3:57:46.500]  Why did we die?
