[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:11.440 --> 00:19.680]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:19.680 --> 00:34.880]  Of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34.880 --> 00:41.840]  By officiating the unproven theory that petroleum oil is a non-renewable fossil fuel, the oil
[00:41.840 --> 00:48.760]  companies were able to adjust the price accordingly, all the way into the peak oil scare that foretold
[00:48.760 --> 00:54.240]  the calamity of the world soon running out of oil, which further benefited the industry's
[00:54.240 --> 00:56.520]  oil pricing schemes.
[00:56.520 --> 01:02.880]  The wells never did go dry, and the ones once emptied filled back up, so the science we
[01:02.880 --> 01:09.640]  have today favors the abiotic theory over the fossil fuel theory, which is that oil
[01:09.640 --> 01:17.000]  is a natural renewable component of our ecosystem, and we see this in our oceans, underwater
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.880]  methane lakes deep beneath the surface, with their own unique thriving ecosystems.
[01:23.880 --> 01:30.520]  And so the story changed from the world will soon run out of oil, to the world will most
[01:30.520 --> 01:36.560]  certainly end if we don't stop using oil, and because nobody seems to know what science
[01:36.560 --> 01:43.200]  is anymore, and most people just do as they're told, the world is about to end, for millions
[01:43.200 --> 01:50.240]  of people, and probably more, because our civilization is built upon fossil fuels, and the powers
[01:50.240 --> 01:53.160]  that be are turning them off.
[01:53.160 --> 01:57.520]  Winter is coming, and Germany is set to be very cold.
[01:57.520 --> 02:03.240]  Angela Merkel saved her political career by appeasing the anti-nuclear movement, and shutting
[02:03.240 --> 02:06.160]  down Germany's nuclear power.
[02:06.160 --> 02:11.760]  Out of 17 plants, they have already shut down 11, and are still in the process of shutting
[02:11.760 --> 02:19.240]  down the rest, removing 25% of their power, without anything to replace it, because their
[02:19.240 --> 02:22.700]  green deal turned out to be a failure.
[02:22.700 --> 02:30.080]  After all the hype, Germany's dependence on fossil fuel is at 76%, so they are temporarily
[02:30.080 --> 02:35.000]  switching back to coal and oil, but that's a real problem, because they've neglected
[02:35.000 --> 02:40.520]  their own fuel industry, and become dependent upon Russia's, and the German government would
[02:40.520 --> 02:45.160]  rather have the country freeze to death than buy fuel from Russia.
[02:45.160 --> 02:50.720]  The German economy is based on highly innovative production, which requires a great deal of
[02:50.720 --> 02:56.480]  energy that they no longer produce, and so running out of fuel will quickly collapse
[02:56.480 --> 03:02.680]  the German economy, which will cause a tsunami of economic destruction throughout the EU
[03:02.680 --> 03:07.480]  and the world, and the German government is letting it happen.
[03:07.480 --> 03:12.400]  They could leave some nuclear plants online, but they still plan on shutting it all down
[03:12.400 --> 03:15.600]  by the end of this year, to stay green.
[03:15.600 --> 03:21.960]  Some anti-carbon environmentalists are saying that nuclear power is the greenest option,
[03:21.960 --> 03:25.720]  and maybe that's true, but none of their schemes add up.
[03:25.720 --> 03:31.400]  So far, the green agenda has only successfully accomplished making people feel good about
[03:31.400 --> 03:35.360]  themselves while they destroy their own society.
[03:35.360 --> 03:41.480]  The EU and Britain are actually reverting back to burning wood as fuel, and claim that
[03:41.480 --> 03:45.280]  it is carbon neutral, which is a lie.
[03:45.280 --> 03:49.480]  Societies have steadily evolved towards a cleaner, more efficient energy, starting from
[03:49.480 --> 03:55.960]  wood, the least clean and efficient, and moving to coal, followed by oil and gas.
[03:55.960 --> 04:03.160]  And now, nearly 40% of Europe's renewable energy is wood, which mostly comes from clear-cutting
[04:03.160 --> 04:06.240]  forests in the United States.
[04:06.240 --> 04:09.160]  This new green deal is a complete lie.
[04:09.160 --> 04:14.000]  It's just another part of the creepy elite's great reset.
[04:14.000 --> 04:21.200]  These elite bloodlines want a new cashless society, but one more like the Middle Ages,
[04:21.200 --> 04:24.960]  which for these spoiled inbreds, is the good old days.
[04:24.960 --> 04:29.520]  And if they succeed, it looks like Germany will get there first.
[04:29.520 --> 04:34.760]  And in the midst of all this chaos, the German government is focused on allowing children
[04:34.760 --> 04:41.600]  age 14 and older to change their gender and first names without parental permission once
[04:41.600 --> 04:45.240]  a year for as often as they want.
[04:45.240 --> 04:47.800]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:47.800 --> 04:53.400]  All right, all eyes are on InfoWars, and we've been the number one story in the country.
[04:53.400 --> 04:58.080]  The last 24 hours, you get explosive details of what in the world is really going on.
[04:58.080 --> 05:00.760]  Let's bring it in.
[05:00.760 --> 05:02.560]  InfoWars has been vindicated.
[05:02.560 --> 05:03.960]  We've been proven right.
[05:03.960 --> 05:06.640]  World government, the New World Order is out of the open.
[05:06.640 --> 05:12.560]  And now, more than ever, the forces of Satan are trying to shut down this broadcast.
[05:12.560 --> 05:17.000]  The forces of anti-human, godless New World Order are out of control.
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.040]  So now, realize, we have pushed them out of the light.
[05:20.040 --> 05:24.000]  We have pushed them out in the open, and they are so upset, and they are so scared.
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.920]  So while you still can, because any day can be our last broadcast, spread the word about
[05:27.920 --> 05:32.600]  the show, share the article, share the videos, and please, fund us while getting great products
[05:32.600 --> 05:39.480]  at the same time at infowarsstore.com, books, films, t-shirts, great supplements, vitamin
[05:39.480 --> 05:46.040]  real fusion, body sales and matrimonial formula, Ultra 12, a diet for so much more right now
[05:46.040 --> 05:47.040]  at infowarsore.com.
[05:47.040 --> 05:51.720]  But whatever you do, pray for justice, and pray for freedom, and pray for the children,
[05:51.720 --> 05:54.560]  and pray for free speech, and justice to win.
[05:54.560 --> 05:57.600]  Thank you so much for joining us, and I'll spread the word, my friends.
[05:57.600 --> 05:59.920]  We're involved in an epic, historic battle.
[05:59.920 --> 06:15.560]  It's Thursday, August 4th, 2022.
[06:15.560 --> 06:41.160]  The jury is out in Austin, Texas, on how guilty I am.
[06:41.160 --> 06:47.360]  I can't be found innocent, the judge told him at least 20 times, including in the jury
[06:47.360 --> 06:50.360]  charge yesterday while I sat there in the courtroom.
[06:50.360 --> 06:51.760]  This man is guilty.
[06:51.760 --> 06:53.320]  I say he is.
[06:53.320 --> 06:57.440]  Now go find out how much money.
[06:57.440 --> 07:02.240]  They said they wanted $3 billion yesterday, and they've gone up from $150 million to $3
[07:02.240 --> 07:03.240]  billion.
[07:03.240 --> 07:06.960]  Might as well be at $3 trillion, or $3 quadrillion.
[07:06.960 --> 07:09.000]  It's unbelievable.
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.840]  Even in their closing statements, they said Mr. Jones makes $300 million a year.
[07:13.840 --> 07:20.200]  I thought it was $160 million a year, and it just went on from there, an incredible
[07:20.200 --> 07:21.200]  spectacle.
[07:21.200 --> 07:26.080]  Now, obviously, it was the top on Twitter, the top on the nightly news last night, the
[07:26.080 --> 07:29.440]  top story in the country, Alex Jones.
[07:29.440 --> 07:30.840]  And why was that?
[07:30.840 --> 07:34.960]  Well, this isn't really about what I said questioning Sandy Hook.
[07:34.960 --> 07:37.280]  In fact, I wasn't even sued for those statements.
[07:37.280 --> 07:41.400]  We were sued for statements Owen made simply reading a zero-hedge article.
[07:41.400 --> 07:47.440]  But in the charge where the judge finds us guilty, it's Owen's statements, which isn't
[07:47.440 --> 07:49.800]  defamation or anything.
[07:49.800 --> 07:55.560]  In my view, they'll be reading a zero-hedge article questioning Megyn Kelly's report.
[07:55.560 --> 07:57.120]  But what's the big top story?
[07:57.120 --> 08:00.960]  Why is the international media tuning in right now to try to take edits of them about to
[08:00.960 --> 08:03.520]  say and misrepresent it?
[08:03.520 --> 08:09.920]  I'm sitting there in their cross-examination of me when I was the final witness yesterday
[08:09.920 --> 08:16.840]  morning, and the plaintiff's lawyer said, do you know what perjury is?
[08:16.840 --> 08:18.560]  And I said, yeah, I know what perjury is.
[08:18.560 --> 08:19.960]  I'm paraphrasing all this.
[08:19.960 --> 08:23.680]  And he said, well, you've engaged in perjury.
[08:23.680 --> 08:28.800]  You told me you'd look for Sandy Hook text messages in your phone, and, well, we have
[08:28.800 --> 08:33.320]  your whole phone now, and we have the Sandy Hook messages.
[08:33.320 --> 08:35.800]  And I said, wow, this is your Perry Mason moment.
[08:35.800 --> 08:36.800]  Tell me, please.
[08:36.800 --> 08:37.800]  What it is?
[08:37.800 --> 08:43.000]  Well, your lawyer accidentally sent us 10 days ago or 12 days ago, whatever it was he
[08:43.000 --> 08:44.000]  said.
[08:44.000 --> 08:45.000]  I'll play the clip in a moment.
[08:45.000 --> 08:50.360]  Accidentally sent us your whole phone, so they're going, hmm.
[08:50.360 --> 08:57.200]  And I go, well, I do know that I gave the Texas lawyers and the Connecticut lawyers the current
[08:57.200 --> 09:02.680]  phone I had when they subpoenaed it a few years ago, and I dug around and found one
[09:02.680 --> 09:06.120]  of my old phones and just handed it off to IT and said, whatever the search terms are,
[09:06.120 --> 09:07.120]  give it to them.
[09:07.120 --> 09:13.480]  And it turns out that they gave them to them in six-month chunks up in Connecticut so they
[09:13.480 --> 09:15.640]  could search for the group of terms they gave us.
[09:15.640 --> 09:18.720]  But notice, I was defaulted for not giving them anything.
[09:18.720 --> 09:19.720]  They got depositions.
[09:19.720 --> 09:22.920]  They got hundreds of thousands of emails on every subject you can imagine.
[09:22.920 --> 09:27.080]  They've got my text messages, which they already had in Connecticut.
[09:27.080 --> 09:31.760]  And then when my lawyer in Texas became joint counsel in Connecticut, a few weeks ago, they
[09:31.760 --> 09:33.800]  sent him the whole file.
[09:33.800 --> 09:38.560]  And while sending some of those files over to the plaintiff's lawyers, they sent over
[09:38.560 --> 09:43.320]  some files they shouldn't have, mainly the medical records we got in depositions of some
[09:43.320 --> 09:46.080]  of the Sandy Hook families from our depositions.
[09:46.080 --> 09:48.200]  This has been a long litigated fight.
[09:48.200 --> 09:49.200]  So that is wrong.
[09:49.200 --> 09:50.200]  It's a big mistake.
[09:50.200 --> 09:51.680]  The lawyer owns up to it.
[09:51.680 --> 09:57.960]  But the text messages from Alex Jones are from 2019, the end of the year, and a few
[09:57.960 --> 09:59.840]  months into 2020.
[09:59.840 --> 10:03.160]  Nothing about January 6, like they're saying in the news.
[10:03.160 --> 10:06.880]  Because yesterday we heard this, we went and looked at the file that was sent, pulled it
[10:06.880 --> 10:09.840]  up, looked at it, I read through it.
[10:09.840 --> 10:10.840]  That's it.
[10:10.840 --> 10:13.520]  Nothing there.
[10:13.520 --> 10:17.320]  But they get up and say, well, of course, what's going to want to know about this?
[10:17.320 --> 10:22.880]  And this morning they got up in front of the kangaroo court and said, I've been contacted
[10:22.880 --> 10:26.720]  by a bunch of law enforcement, judge, please don't cut any of the feed this morning.
[10:26.720 --> 10:27.720]  They're all watching.
[10:27.720 --> 10:32.920]  And the January 6 committees involved, and by my ex-wives involved, haven't talked
[10:32.920 --> 10:33.920]  to her in years.
[10:33.920 --> 10:38.160]  And just, it's a free for all, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:38.160 --> 10:40.520]  And none of it's true.
[10:40.520 --> 10:42.680]  Absolute, absolute bull.
[10:42.680 --> 10:48.040]  It is not my whole phone, and it is not me perjuring myself or dodging things.
[10:48.040 --> 10:52.920]  Because as soon as he said, oh, we got your text messages, I went, well, of course you
[10:52.920 --> 10:54.440]  got it from my lawyers.
[10:54.440 --> 10:55.440]  Because I gave it to him.
[10:55.440 --> 10:58.080]  And I said, I've gone through my messages.
[10:58.080 --> 11:05.880]  That means I've given it to my lawyers to say here, because there's nothing on my phone.
[11:05.880 --> 11:08.280]  Hardly ever talked about Sandy Hook.
[11:08.280 --> 11:15.520]  And then there's like a Paul Watson text to me about, hey, this article looks like BS.
[11:15.520 --> 11:17.160]  It's like the Sandy Hook stuff.
[11:17.160 --> 11:19.720]  You might want to take it down.
[11:19.720 --> 11:22.320]  Some story about COVID that turned out to be true.
[11:22.320 --> 11:30.760]  But the point is, is that this is insane, totally and completely insane.
[11:30.760 --> 11:35.760]  And it's the globalist using lawyers at every level of society and bureaucracy.
[11:35.760 --> 11:40.600]  That's what Agenda 2030 is, to just shut down all their competition.
[11:40.600 --> 11:45.760]  And so what's being used against me is going to be used against you.
[11:45.760 --> 11:52.240]  Now, my lawyer here in Texas, Andino Rainel, this is posted on infowars.com, or it's about
[11:52.240 --> 11:56.920]  to be Paul Watson's writing article about it, filed a protective order injunction already
[11:56.920 --> 12:02.880]  tied back to the previous protective order from December 2, 2021.
[12:02.880 --> 12:06.600]  And it lists his email to their lawyers right after they accidentally sent him the wrong
[12:06.600 --> 12:09.960]  file, which happens all the time, saying disregard that, don't use it.
[12:09.960 --> 12:14.840]  We'll send you the right link while they downloaded it and waited and did use it.
[12:14.840 --> 12:19.480]  And saying, hey, that's got medical stuff with the Sandy Hook people in it.
[12:19.480 --> 12:21.760]  Don't download that.
[12:21.760 --> 12:26.120]  And they didn't care that when it hadn't still happened.
[12:26.120 --> 12:35.880]  And so that's what's unfolding right now, and it's just insane.
[12:35.880 --> 12:41.760]  Absolutely crazy, the point that this country and this world has gotten to.
[12:41.760 --> 12:46.880]  And the hysteria around January 6, I tried to stop January 6.
[12:46.880 --> 12:47.880]  Everybody knows that.
[12:47.880 --> 12:52.320]  I've done big rallies all over the country, and the hysterical glee when I walked out
[12:52.320 --> 12:58.600]  of the courthouse yesterday at like five o'clock with dozens of TV cameras lined up, smiling
[12:58.600 --> 13:04.440]  and laughing and screaming at me and saying, reporters saying, you're going down.
[13:04.440 --> 13:06.880]  Chan six has got you.
[13:06.880 --> 13:10.960]  And of course, they made sure to bring up court this morning.
[13:10.960 --> 13:12.960]  This is.
[13:12.960 --> 13:15.840]  Part of his phone, not the whole phone now.
[13:15.840 --> 13:18.240]  And Roger Stone is in there.
[13:18.240 --> 13:21.160]  Oh, oh my God, like, hey, Roger, come on the show.
[13:21.160 --> 13:26.600]  Or, hey, Roger, what's going on with this totally innocuous stuff?
[13:26.600 --> 13:27.600]  We went and looked at it.
[13:27.600 --> 13:30.240]  I already know it's innocuous.
[13:30.240 --> 13:31.740]  They've already been through the phone.
[13:31.740 --> 13:36.240]  They got it 12, 13 days ago or the fragment of the phone.
[13:36.240 --> 13:44.880]  And when they put their supposed badness about me up there on television.
[13:44.880 --> 13:47.920]  So that's what's going on here.
[13:47.920 --> 13:53.760]  And they want to use these proceedings, as I've always said, to try to gen up something
[13:53.760 --> 13:55.400]  criminal.
[13:55.400 --> 13:56.400]  And that's what they're doing now.
[13:56.400 --> 14:01.280]  I'm trying to say you're being referred for perjury because you said there weren't Sandy
[14:01.280 --> 14:02.280]  Hook text.
[14:02.280 --> 14:07.120]  No, I said I've gone through them and that's what we've done.
[14:07.120 --> 14:08.120]  Hand it over.
[14:08.120 --> 14:11.640]  But I got to tell you the experience with the legal system, even when the lawyers mean
[14:11.640 --> 14:13.920]  well, is just a nightmare.
[14:13.920 --> 14:18.200]  And when my lawyers make mistakes, it's the end of the world, when their lawyers do whatever
[14:18.200 --> 14:21.680]  they want, well, then that's okay.
[14:21.680 --> 14:24.360]  And that's how they weaponize these things.
[14:24.360 --> 14:29.640]  But look, folks, don't tune in here to hear about just what's happening to me.
[14:29.640 --> 14:33.280]  You tune in to learn about what's happened with the New World Order, what I think is
[14:33.280 --> 14:36.920]  coming next, and what is unfolding in society.
[14:36.920 --> 14:39.080]  But if you want the truth, I don't know if it's up there yet.
[14:39.080 --> 14:40.080]  We can check infowars.com.
[14:40.080 --> 14:42.200]  I just talked to Paul before he went live.
[14:42.200 --> 14:44.040]  He said it was going up in a few minutes.
[14:44.040 --> 14:48.680]  You can find the article that Paul's doing about this number one story in the country.
[14:48.680 --> 14:49.680]  We've got it.
[14:49.680 --> 14:51.480]  It's as big as Hunter Biden's laptop.
[14:51.480 --> 14:52.480]  It's over.
[14:52.480 --> 14:58.000]  It'll have all of the information, him and Trump and Stone planning everything in January
[14:58.000 --> 15:04.520]  six and hip, hip, hooray, and wow, this is like finding the Holy Grail.
[15:04.520 --> 15:09.400]  And then of course, none of that is true.
[15:09.400 --> 15:16.440]  It's a year before January six and has nothing to do with it.
[15:16.440 --> 15:23.040]  And if anything, I say more radical things on air than I do on text messages.
[15:23.040 --> 15:27.320]  And the idea that there's some type of criminal activity on there is preposterous.
[15:27.320 --> 15:33.640]  And again, as soon as he said, you know, got your text messages from your lawyer, I'm
[15:33.640 --> 15:35.880]  like, yeah, get them to him.
[15:35.880 --> 15:41.040]  Well, we got you now, boy, you said you didn't have any text messages.
[15:41.040 --> 15:45.200]  No, I said I'd look for all the stupid Sandy Hook stuff and give it over to the lawyers.
[15:45.200 --> 15:47.240]  That's what I said.
[15:47.240 --> 15:48.240]  Unbelievable.
[15:48.240 --> 15:51.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, how these people operate.
[15:51.240 --> 16:00.680]  Meanwhile, the crackhead Chinese spy, Hunter Biden's free with the red button.
[16:00.680 --> 16:06.360]  World Wars has been vindicated, we've been proven right, world government, the New World Order is out of the open.
[16:06.360 --> 16:12.280]  And now more than ever, the forces of Satan are trying to shut down this broadcast.
[16:12.280 --> 16:16.720]  The forces of anti-human, godless New World Order are out of control.
[16:16.720 --> 16:20.840]  So now realize we have pushed them out of the light, we have pushed them out in the
[16:20.840 --> 16:23.720]  open and they are so upset, they are so scared.
[16:23.720 --> 16:27.600]  So while you still can, because any day can be our last broadcast, spread the word about
[16:27.600 --> 16:32.360]  the show, share the article, share the videos, and please fund us while getting great products

[16:51.680 --> 16:54.280]  and pray for free speech and justice to win.
[16:54.280 --> 16:55.920]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[16:55.920 --> 17:00.040]  I'll spread the word, my friends, we're involved in an epic historic battle.
[17:00.040 --> 17:05.520]  The globalist great reset or the war for the world is here, but humanity is not being caught
[17:05.520 --> 17:10.040]  flat footed because of info wars and because of your support.
[17:10.040 --> 17:14.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever as we reach the critical heart of
[17:14.680 --> 17:19.960]  the battle, that you spread the word and that you support liberty and that you warn people
[17:19.960 --> 17:22.640]  like you've never done before.
[17:22.640 --> 17:25.000]  We have come so far together.
[17:25.000 --> 17:26.520]  Please help keep us on the air.
[17:26.520 --> 17:30.000]  We're under massive attack right now, but we're going to win with your help.
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.320]  We're going to overcome this with your help and with God's blessing.
[17:33.320 --> 17:36.720]  Please go to infoworks.com and get this book.
[17:36.720 --> 17:39.040]  Many, many, many years of research have gone into this.

[17:44.600 --> 17:47.240]  There's also signed copies available as well.
[17:47.240 --> 17:50.680]  We've got a lot of other big projects we're working on that are about to start launching
[17:50.680 --> 17:51.680]  as well.
[17:51.680 --> 17:55.840]  This is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because it warns the
[17:55.840 --> 17:57.680]  world of the globalist plan.
[17:57.680 --> 18:00.120]  Get the great reset at infoworks.com.
[18:00.120 --> 18:05.480]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual
[18:05.480 --> 18:10.080]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages and the studies are all clear.
[18:10.080 --> 18:16.720]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there's problems in the bedroom and the number
[18:16.720 --> 18:20.400]  one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[18:20.400 --> 18:24.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people
[18:24.080 --> 18:26.520]  having lasting good love and relationships.
[18:26.520 --> 18:32.920]  They want to break up society and we are so excited to have the number one natural male
[18:32.920 --> 18:37.600]  enhancement pill in the world available as a major sponsor now.

[19:05.680 --> 19:10.880]  highest quality signature reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon and other U.S. government
[19:10.880 --> 19:18.040]  agencies and now they have produced specifically for us this made America onion line at a very
[19:18.040 --> 19:19.680]  affordable price.

[19:24.640 --> 19:29.680]  and iPads or big bags that promote whatever electronics you want to put in it like desktop
[19:29.680 --> 19:30.680]  computers.

[19:43.120 --> 19:49.080]  In this insane world, you are crazy if you don't protect your signature, your identity
[19:49.080 --> 19:53.560]  from identity theft, hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.
[19:53.560 --> 20:01.200]  This is one of the hottest items out there today that's exclusively available at infowarsport.com.
[20:01.200 --> 20:24.080]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:24.080 --> 20:43.600]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[20:43.600 --> 20:46.760]  They're coming for me because they have to get through me to get to you.
[20:46.760 --> 20:48.880]  I swore this fight.
[20:48.880 --> 20:49.880]  I'm of good cheer.
[20:49.880 --> 20:53.320]  I'm actually very proud that we're the number one enemy of the globalist because we represent
[20:53.320 --> 20:56.360]  populism and Christianity and the human resistance.
[20:56.360 --> 21:01.840]  We represent a pro-human future with the exclusive on the top story in the country.
[21:01.840 --> 21:04.000]  It's even all over the world being reported.
[21:04.000 --> 21:08.440]  It's supposedly my phone has fallen into their hands and it proves everything.
[21:08.440 --> 21:10.160]  It's bigger than Hunter Biden's laptop.
[21:10.160 --> 21:12.120]  It's all over.
[21:12.120 --> 21:17.400]  Exclusive with the documents is at infowars.com and summit.news.
[21:17.400 --> 21:20.960]  But here is part of the Perry Mason moment yesterday that wasn't.
[21:20.960 --> 21:28.440]  So you did get my text messages and it said you didn't, a nice tray, I mean it says not.
[21:28.440 --> 21:34.280]  Yes, Mr. Jones, indeed you didn't give this text message to me, you don't know where this
[21:34.280 --> 21:35.280]  came from.
[21:35.280 --> 21:36.280]  Do you know where I got this?
[21:36.280 --> 21:37.280]  No.
[21:37.280 --> 21:45.840]  Mr. Jones, did you know that 12 days ago, 12 days ago, your attorneys messed up and
[21:45.840 --> 21:52.440]  sent me an entire digital copy of your entire cell phone with every text message you've
[21:52.440 --> 21:59.320]  sent for the past two years and when informed did not take any steps to identify it as privileged
[21:59.320 --> 22:04.520]  or protected in any way and as of two days ago it fell free and clear into my possession
[22:04.520 --> 22:08.800]  and that is how I know you lied to me when you said you didn't have text messages about
[22:08.800 --> 22:09.800]  Sandy Hook.
[22:09.800 --> 22:10.800]  Did you know that?
[22:10.800 --> 22:12.440]  See, I told you the truth.
[22:12.440 --> 22:13.800]  This is your Perry Mason moment.
[22:13.800 --> 22:18.400]  I gave them my phone and Mr. Jones, you need to answer the question.
[22:18.400 --> 22:23.800]  No, I didn't notice that, but I mean I told you I gave them the phone over and just said
[22:23.800 --> 22:24.800]  no.
[22:24.800 --> 22:31.960]  And you said in your deposition you searched your phone, you said you pulled down the text,
[22:31.960 --> 22:37.600]  did the search function for Sandy Hook, that's what you said Mr. Jones, correct?
[22:37.600 --> 22:42.680]  And I had several different phones with this number but I did, yeah, I mean that's why
[22:42.680 --> 22:43.680]  you got it.
[22:43.680 --> 22:46.680]  No, Mr. Jones, that's not what I have.
[22:46.680 --> 22:50.160]  My lawyer said it to you but I'm hiding it, okay.
[22:50.160 --> 22:51.160]  Mr. Jones?
[22:51.160 --> 22:52.160]  Mr. Jones, that's-
[22:52.160 --> 22:58.840]  Just answer questions, there's no question, Mr. Benson also only asks questions.
[22:58.840 --> 22:59.840]  Sure.
[22:59.840 --> 23:05.760]  Mr. Jones, in discovery you were asked do you have Sandy Hook text messages on your phone
[23:05.760 --> 23:08.360]  and you said no, correct?
[23:08.360 --> 23:14.000]  You said that under oath, Mr. Johnson, didn't you?
[23:14.000 --> 23:18.000]  I mean I was mistaken, I was mistaken but you got the messages right there.
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.800]  You know what pertinence is, I just want to make sure you know before we go any further,
[23:21.800 --> 23:22.800]  you know what it is.
[23:22.800 --> 23:29.040]  Yes, I do, I mean I'm not a tech guy, I told you I gave in my text money the phone to the
[23:29.040 --> 23:32.800]  lawyers before or whatever and so you got my phone but we didn't give it to you.
[23:32.800 --> 23:37.920]  No, Mr. Jones, one more time, please remember if you need to answer it for the minute if
[23:37.920 --> 23:43.200]  I need to know that you can't do that but you testified.
[23:43.200 --> 23:46.960]  You can invoke your fifth amendment and of course my lawyer should have got up at that
[23:46.960 --> 23:54.280]  point and said and I'm not attacking, it's just a fact, show us the deposition.
[23:54.280 --> 24:00.720]  The guys deposed me, Benson's deposed me, said three years at four times and I've deposed
[24:00.720 --> 24:04.880]  four times by Connecticut but I never talked to them so I'm defaulted.
[24:04.880 --> 24:11.280]  They've got all this stuff and I did search one of my phones and he didn't have Sandy
[24:11.280 --> 24:15.080]  Hook stuff in it and then they came back and said, well they're saying you're hiding it,
[24:15.080 --> 24:17.080]  do you have any old phones?
[24:17.080 --> 24:22.080]  Tour the office apart and I just said here, go search it and give it to the damn lawyers
[24:22.080 --> 24:27.200]  because I wasn't talking about Sandy Hook, I don't care about Sandy Hook, we don't cover
[24:27.200 --> 24:33.440]  it other than when they force us to and it's just so incredibly sick that I sit there and
[24:33.440 --> 24:40.560]  give the damn lawyers all the text messages and then they send it over to Connecticut,
[24:40.560 --> 24:47.360]  the Texas lawyers before the new one I have never even gave them the stuff I gave them
[24:47.360 --> 24:54.600]  or that's what they claim and then I'm sitting there in the final witness in a trial where
[24:54.600 --> 24:59.920]  I've already been found guilty by the judge for not giving stuff over and my lawyers give
[24:59.920 --> 25:06.600]  them the raw text messages of six months from 2019 early 2020, that's the reality and then
[25:06.600 --> 25:13.760]  I see a text message from Paul Watson saying this story sounds like Sandy Hook bull, a story
[25:13.760 --> 25:20.080]  about COVID, how is that even pertinent, how is that lying about something?
[25:20.080 --> 25:24.400]  We get tens of thousands of emails a day, I don't even have an email at InfoWars because
[25:24.400 --> 25:28.480]  I can't keep track of it, got rid of it over a decade ago and everybody knows that but
[25:28.480 --> 25:36.720]  I'm going to say this right now, this is the annihilation of justice and as I predicted
[25:36.720 --> 25:43.840]  they want to find something criminal in all of this and if being wrong in a deposition
[25:43.840 --> 25:48.720]  which I really wasn't wrong is criminal, what is it to get up as they said in his closing
[25:48.720 --> 25:59.280]  statements that I make $300 million a year, we haven't made $300 million in six years gross
[25:59.280 --> 26:04.960]  and then in the closing arguments to the jury, the other lawyer said, Mr. Jones today on
[26:04.960 --> 26:09.000]  the stand said FBI agents murdered the kids at Sandy Hook and everybody goes what?
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.080]  When my lawyer got up he said you just saw Alex on the stand earlier and when you deliberate
[26:14.080 --> 26:19.920]  you should go pull up the video of that and as for that testimony, Mr. Jones didn't say
[26:19.920 --> 26:25.760]  FBI agents murdered people at Sandy Hook, their lawyer got up and said this man today in front
[26:25.760 --> 26:31.640]  of you said FBI agents murdered children, what in the world?
[26:31.640 --> 26:38.360]  You talk about perjury, you talk about crazy but see they know they control the appeals
[26:38.360 --> 26:43.720]  court, they control the Texas bar and they control that Soros left his judge so they
[26:43.720 --> 26:50.280]  can do anything but that's okay, I'm not here to keep my head down, I'm not here to sit
[26:50.280 --> 26:55.440]  on the sidelines, I asked to be in the arena, I prayed to God to help me expose the new
[26:55.440 --> 27:00.480]  world order because I want to stop these globalist pedophile rings and I knew the mark of the
[27:00.480 --> 27:04.040]  beast was coming and I knew it was the right thing to do so I'm not like all these other
[27:04.040 --> 27:10.360]  so-called men that aren't the arena, I'm in the arena but I want you to know I am fighting
[27:10.360 --> 27:14.640]  for you and for my own family and for all of us and I need your hope, your prayers,
[27:14.640 --> 27:17.240]  I need your support.
[27:17.240 --> 27:20.280]  Today or tomorrow after the jury comes in with their first verdict then they have the punitive
[27:20.280 --> 27:24.240]  damages and they'll testify again on net worth and I'm going to tell the truth, the whole
[27:24.240 --> 27:28.520]  truth, nothing but the truth and you'll hear about everything I've got at that.
[27:28.520 --> 27:33.320]  I was there this morning with lawyers making damn sure everything's listed, how many cars
[27:33.320 --> 27:38.120]  I got, the house I got, they put my cell phone number out, everybody's, I got to get a new
[27:38.120 --> 27:42.840]  number now, they put my cell phone number out in court yesterday, home address is all of
[27:42.840 --> 27:47.240]  it, this is all part of my persecution, that's okay, Christ said pick up your cross and follow
[27:47.240 --> 27:52.560]  me and if you're following me you're going to get persecuted.
[27:52.560 --> 27:58.560]  I know this life is a flash, this is a test and I'm sure not perfect, believe that but
[27:58.560 --> 28:03.320]  I mean well and I love God and I love justice and I am extremely honored to be here and
[28:03.320 --> 28:07.440]  this is exactly where I wanted to be but I want to ask you at this part of the most intense
[28:07.440 --> 28:12.240]  fight beginning at the crucible is I go into the middle of the enemy hyenas to literally
[28:12.240 --> 28:16.040]  tear me to pieces, you think this is bad it's going to get a lot worse, I told you a long
[28:16.040 --> 28:21.520]  time ago I will be destroyed, I told you that 20 years ago, I told you that 10 years ago
[28:21.520 --> 28:25.360]  because they're coming for you next and when they're annihilating and killing billions
[28:25.360 --> 28:29.640]  of you I want you to remember that I fought for you because through this fight coming
[28:29.640 --> 28:35.800]  we will overcome these people, I won't overcome them in my lifetime but many of you watching
[28:35.800 --> 28:43.880]  will and yours, they're going down, I am in the arena, this is where I want to be, this
[28:43.880 --> 28:50.560]  is the way to go down baby, this is just the beginning, my destruction will be spectacular
[28:50.560 --> 29:00.480]  and it will be a light to others to lead the charge into the future for our children.
[29:00.480 --> 29:04.680]  Info wars has been vindicated, we've been proven right, world government, the new world
[29:04.680 --> 29:10.840]  order is out of the open and now more than ever the forces of Satan are trying to shut
[29:10.840 --> 29:16.480]  down this broadcast, the forces of anti-human, godless new world order are out of control
[29:16.480 --> 29:20.800]  so now realize we have pushed them out in the light, we have pushed them out in the
[29:20.800 --> 29:25.600]  open and they are so upset, they are so scared so well you still can because any day can
[29:25.600 --> 29:29.680]  be our last broadcast, spread the word about the show, share the art, we'll share the videos

[32:08.840 --> 32:12.920]  bringing you amazing products that really work, so we looked at the supplement market
[32:12.920 --> 32:18.640]  that we fund a lot of our operations with and we said, what are the best selling natural,
[32:18.640 --> 32:23.160]  healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that are out there, we went and looked at the top
[32:23.160 --> 32:28.800]  10 and they all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product, but with our
[32:28.800 --> 32:37.320]  new product from x7 diet force, we got the very best concentrates of these known natural
[32:37.320 --> 32:42.440]  essences that just do amazing things for your body, and so I've lost almost 40 pounds,
[32:42.440 --> 32:46.520]  I'm so a little bit overweight, in the last three months and I've been doing it using
[32:46.520 --> 32:49.000]  diet force and also exercise.
[32:49.000 --> 32:57.200]  Well now diet force is exclusively available right now at infowarsstore.com, 40% off, infowarsstore.com,
[32:57.200 --> 33:01.040]  diet force, you need to take this product, it really works.
[33:01.040 --> 33:27.520]  Eating a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:27.520 --> 33:35.160]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, live from the infowars.com
[33:35.160 --> 33:41.720]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:41.720 --> 33:49.640]  I signed up for this a long time ago, I signed on the dotted line, not with the devil, but
[33:49.640 --> 33:58.160]  with God, and God showed me the path forward, and I chose this path and everything that
[33:58.160 --> 34:02.240]  was laid out before me is now proceeding in God's plan.
[34:02.240 --> 34:06.680]  You've always got to remember that Satan has control for a limited time, but it's all part
[34:06.680 --> 34:11.400]  of God's plan, remember that, and they're laughing at you when they're lying about you,
[34:11.400 --> 34:15.920]  when they're attacking you, when they're hurting you, when they're killing you, that in the
[34:15.920 --> 34:25.000]  end, this is all just a test, it wasn't all just set up by happenstance, this planet,
[34:25.000 --> 34:31.080]  the cosmos, our free will, it is a beautiful gift from God, but with it comes great responsibility.
[34:31.080 --> 34:36.320]  All right, let me say this right now that I'm going to hit the news that they don't
[34:36.320 --> 34:40.440]  want us to cover, or they want to distract me with all these lawsuits and attempted
[34:40.440 --> 34:45.840]  criminal charges and January 6th garbage and lies, because they want us out of the game,
[34:45.840 --> 34:49.520]  they don't want us rallying humanity and awakening humanity.
[34:49.520 --> 34:57.520]  We just saw big developments with massive wins by hardcore patriots in the primary election
[34:57.520 --> 34:58.520]  yesterday.
[34:58.520 --> 35:03.080]  Roger Stone joins us, star of the next hour, then Robert Barnes, Owen Schreuer, and so
[35:03.080 --> 35:04.080]  many others.
[35:04.080 --> 35:09.120]  And we're also waiting for the jury's verdict on how guilty I am, you're guilty until proven
[35:09.120 --> 35:16.560]  guilty or in the new blue city, blue state systems, and again, people ask, why do you
[35:16.560 --> 35:21.560]  live in Austin, my mother's family's from here.
[35:21.560 --> 35:23.960]  I grew up in Dallas and grew up here.
[35:23.960 --> 35:30.480]  I love Austin, it's a great place, but it's controlled by the globalist now, and everybody's
[35:30.480 --> 35:35.880]  welcome here in Texas, we love you, but it's kind of hard to leave a place when your ancestors
[35:35.880 --> 35:39.720]  have been here since the 1820s.
[35:39.720 --> 35:43.080]  My family originally, before they moved to Waterloo, which was what Austin was originally
[35:43.080 --> 35:48.760]  known as, lived in Gonzales, Texas, and were in the main fight in the first battle of Texas
[35:48.760 --> 35:50.760]  independence.
[35:50.760 --> 35:55.760]  And my mother's side of the family raised Colonel Travis' son, the heir's family, and
[35:55.760 --> 36:01.640]  so it is hard to see the fall of many areas of Texas and hard to realize that I need to
[36:01.640 --> 36:05.920]  pull up stakes and get out of here as soon as possible.
[36:05.920 --> 36:13.440]  But we don't have the money or the systems to move this operation at this time out.
[36:13.440 --> 36:16.640]  They're kind of doing us a favor with all the attacks with an infrastructure this big
[36:16.640 --> 36:22.840]  and not be able to continue it on unless we get massive increases in support.
[36:22.840 --> 36:30.040]  But one way or another, I will go down fighting, ladies and gentlemen, and will not whimper
[36:30.040 --> 36:36.800]  because this operation is carried out against us, because again, I asked for this, and I
[36:36.800 --> 36:40.480]  knew we would have victory when triggering Great Awakening, that in the end we'll bring
[36:40.480 --> 36:48.960]  down the New World Order, but you got to pay the piper, you got to pay the boatman.
[36:48.960 --> 36:55.000]  You want to go into hell to free the captives, you got to pay Charon, and I have paid, and
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.800]  I will pay, and I made that deal.
[36:59.800 --> 37:02.400]  So my destruction is victory.
[37:02.400 --> 37:07.240]  Now we want to stay in the fight and fight as hard and long as possible, and I pray
[37:07.240 --> 37:14.320]  for God to give me strength to be as powerful and as effective as I can in this key moment
[37:14.320 --> 37:18.800]  when the forces of true evil come for us, come for you.
[37:18.800 --> 37:21.880]  So I'm going to hit some more news on other subjects, but I'm going to say this right
[37:21.880 --> 37:25.200]  now.
[37:25.200 --> 37:27.600]  I didn't know how insolvent we were six months ago.
[37:27.600 --> 37:29.680]  We didn't have outside accounting firms.
[37:29.680 --> 37:31.160]  We had trouble sourcing products.
[37:31.160 --> 37:33.960]  We had leftist groups that bought up some of our main suppliers.
[37:33.960 --> 37:38.720]  They held on to our money as a joke for a year, one big outlet that we've been using
[37:38.720 --> 37:42.400]  for seven, eight years that was owned by some great folks previously.
[37:42.400 --> 37:43.400]  We learned that was the case.
[37:43.400 --> 37:46.400]  When we said, give us our money back, they said, no, we're not going to.
[37:46.400 --> 37:47.960]  We had to get lawyers involved.
[37:47.960 --> 37:52.200]  We found that the grace of God, even bigger top labs in the country, two of them that
[37:52.200 --> 37:58.360]  are actually listeners, and so the process of 10 of our bestselling products are starting
[37:58.360 --> 38:01.640]  to come back in.
[38:01.640 --> 38:06.840]  But that will still with the numbers we've got to get us into the black with the expenses
[38:06.840 --> 38:08.880]  we have take a few months.
[38:08.880 --> 38:14.640]  I need money now just to pay for the bankruptcy we have, which will allow us to stay on air
[38:14.640 --> 38:19.840]  and operate and reorganize despite all these kangaroo courts and fake judgments that clearly
[38:19.840 --> 38:25.120]  they've engineered that I expect to happen.
[38:25.120 --> 38:28.720]  And so right now is a decision you have to make.
[38:28.720 --> 38:33.680]  As God is my witness, if I put everything I've got into this operation, it will only
[38:33.680 --> 38:36.960]  run in another two months.
[38:36.960 --> 38:43.240]  And I have to have that as an emergency backup just to defend myself personally because obviously
[38:43.240 --> 38:48.240]  I'm carrying the ball and I'll be able to continue to do this through other platforms
[38:48.240 --> 38:52.640]  that I don't own, but we want to try to keep this platform going.
[38:52.640 --> 38:59.000]  And so this has been an ongoing long-term boxing match or wrestling match with the globalist
[38:59.000 --> 39:05.360]  for many years, and it's brought us right to the edge of collapse at this point.
[39:05.360 --> 39:12.200]  And so it's very simple and you've come through so much, but we need to massively increase
[39:12.200 --> 39:17.600]  the capital coming into this operation daily so that we can stay on air.
[39:17.600 --> 39:23.840]  And I don't want to have to prove it to you by shutting down some of the shows, laying
[39:23.840 --> 39:28.240]  off a lot of the crew, and curtailing what we're doing at this key part of the battle
[39:28.240 --> 39:33.600]  when we are one of the only organizations that built the satellite uplinks, the radio
[39:33.600 --> 39:42.640]  uplinks, the servers, the encoders, the infrastructure, the studios, the brain trust of the researchers,
[39:42.640 --> 39:49.600]  the journalists, the editors, people like Gregory, people like John Bowne, and countless others
[39:49.600 --> 39:52.440]  we've supported like Paul Watson.
[39:52.440 --> 39:59.520]  But it really is up to you at this point right now whether we continue on because the extra
[39:59.520 --> 40:04.240]  money that came in the last six months was enough to pay off past debts and get up to
[40:04.240 --> 40:10.520]  speed and order some product that is starting to turn it around but not quick enough.
[40:10.520 --> 40:16.640]  And so they put these headlines out there claiming we have all these millions of dollars
[40:16.640 --> 40:19.880]  when we don't so that you don't think we need support.
[40:19.880 --> 40:26.040]  So I just tell you now, I need everybody listening to go to infowarstore.com and get a 2000 mules
[40:26.040 --> 40:33.520]  film, get an Alex's war documentary, now shipping, to get an end game, to get a body's
[40:33.520 --> 40:39.400]  ultimate turmeric formula, to get bottom of mineral fusion, to get diet force that's a
[40:39.400 --> 40:43.200]  great system of natural compounds that speeds up your metabolism naturally in a healthy
[40:43.200 --> 40:44.200]  way.
[40:44.200 --> 40:49.840]  Really all this stuff's top flight at infowarstore.com, you can also go to infowarstore.com, at
[40:49.840 --> 40:52.880]  the top there's a link that says help fund the tip of the spear.
[40:52.880 --> 40:58.480]  You can make a one-time donation, a multi-time donation, and I've never done this but I've
[40:58.480 --> 41:05.240]  had dinner with some really wealthy people and I've talked to them and I've never really
[41:05.240 --> 41:11.240]  twisted their arm but today I started making phone calls saying listen, if you want to
[41:11.240 --> 41:19.120]  donate and you want to support us, now is the time to do it because we are in the thick
[41:19.120 --> 41:22.000]  of the fight right now.
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.720]  They're cutting off the infrastructure, they're cutting off the energy, they're imploding
[41:24.720 --> 41:29.760]  the borders, they're not coming for everybody, they're attacking everybody now and they don't
[41:29.760 --> 41:32.880]  want us on the air with the new lockdowns they're getting ready.
[41:32.880 --> 41:36.600]  They don't want us on the air with the new election fraud they're about to try to engage
[41:36.600 --> 41:38.820]  in in 96 days in the midterms.
[41:38.820 --> 41:43.360]  They don't want us going in the 2024 election mobilizing the people and so the orders have
[41:43.360 --> 41:49.240]  come down from on high and big money's being spent by this Goliath force to shut down this
[41:49.240 --> 41:50.240]  operation.
[41:50.240 --> 41:54.880]  So I will call this Operation David.
[41:54.880 --> 41:56.200]  You are King David.
[41:56.200 --> 42:02.840]  I am King David but we're not kings of our kingdom yet under Christ.
[42:02.840 --> 42:09.680]  We are the little shepherd out there standing against Goliath and I need you to help us
[42:09.680 --> 42:19.360]  fill our sling with that smooth river stone and help keep us focused and funded into this
[42:19.360 --> 42:20.360]  critical fight.
[42:20.360 --> 42:27.720]  So I really need to see massive support both telling people to tune in and purchasing products
[42:27.720 --> 42:30.200]  and praying for us if that is your choice.
[42:30.200 --> 42:35.560]  It is your choice to make right now at the most intense part of the fight, everything
[42:35.560 --> 42:40.600]  we were built for, everything we've done in 28 years, all your support coming to a head
[42:40.600 --> 42:43.520]  right now to our die time.
[42:43.520 --> 42:47.720]  Spread the word about the show, buy the products and pray for it if you want to keep us on
[42:47.720 --> 42:48.720]  air.
[42:48.720 --> 42:49.960]  I am in your hands.
[42:49.960 --> 42:51.680]  This is beyond the bat signal.
[42:51.680 --> 42:53.360]  It's up to you at this point.
[42:53.360 --> 43:23.320]  We need money to continue the fight.
[43:23.360 --> 43:26.440]  We still can because any day can be our last broadcast.
[43:26.440 --> 43:30.120]  Spread the word about the show, share the article, share the videos and please fund
[43:30.120 --> 43:31.120]  us.
[43:31.120 --> 43:35.320]  We'll get great products at the same time at infowarstore.com.
[43:35.320 --> 43:40.280]  Books, films, t-shirts, great supplements, vitamin real fusion, body's ultimate turmeric
[43:40.280 --> 43:45.720]  formula, Ultra 12, diet for so much more right now at infowarstore.com.
[43:45.720 --> 43:50.880]  But whatever you do, pray for justice and pray for freedom and pray for the children
[43:50.880 --> 43:53.560]  and pray for free speech and justice to win.
[43:53.560 --> 43:55.120]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[43:55.120 --> 43:59.400]  I'll spread the word, my friends, we're involved in an epic historic battle.
[43:59.400 --> 44:05.840]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[44:05.840 --> 44:09.680]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[44:09.680 --> 44:13.200]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[44:13.200 --> 44:14.840]  You might not agree with everything.
[44:14.840 --> 44:18.760]  You might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information.
[44:18.760 --> 44:21.200]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[44:21.200 --> 44:22.520]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[44:22.520 --> 44:26.800]  Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, infowarsstore.com is where to
[44:26.800 --> 44:27.800]  get them, folks.
[44:27.800 --> 44:29.760]  And we do have the best supplements.
[44:29.760 --> 44:36.200]  Just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, we do the best with our
[44:36.200 --> 44:37.720]  supplements as well.
[44:37.720 --> 44:41.520]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula, folks, this is a joke.
[44:41.520 --> 44:44.720]  I mean, we're giving this thing away at 75% off.
[44:44.720 --> 44:45.960]  By the way, it works for me.
[44:45.960 --> 44:51.280]  In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[44:51.280 --> 44:53.240]  Quite well, I might add.
[44:53.240 --> 44:57.320]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[44:57.320 --> 44:59.680]  I go and see them quite often now.
[44:59.680 --> 45:04.800]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S. that supplies the
[45:04.800 --> 45:10.000]  highest quality signature-reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon, and other U.S. government
[45:10.000 --> 45:11.000]  agencies.
[45:11.000 --> 45:17.160]  And now they have produced specifically for us this made in America onion line at a very
[45:17.160 --> 45:22.080]  affordable price, whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone or big pouches
[45:22.080 --> 45:27.480]  that protect laptops and iPads or big bags that promote whatever products you want to
[45:27.480 --> 45:29.720]  put in it, like desktop computers.
[45:29.720 --> 45:36.480]  It is all exclusively available at infowarsstore.com under the Redux name.

[47:01.240 --> 47:28.680]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:28.680 --> 47:58.500]  It's a good news is people like governor to standards are coming out and saying transgender
[47:58.500 --> 48:05.060]  terrorism. Targeting children is child abuse, chemical castration. That clips coming up
[48:05.060 --> 48:14.620]  next hour. The good news is we've seen patriots sweeping the primaries like with the gubernatorial
[48:14.620 --> 48:22.420]  primary in Arizona. We're going to be looking at all that with Roger Stone coming up next
[48:22.420 --> 48:28.420]  hour and so much more. But let's look at this stack of news. This is just part of the
[48:28.420 --> 48:34.980]  economic news. Widespread civil unrest looming in the UK over cost of living. The angrier
[48:34.980 --> 48:41.180]  world that Klaus Schwab talks about. Video, Biden Energy advisor claims it's just factually
[48:41.180 --> 48:46.980]  not true that gas prices were rising before Ukraine invasion. Ninety percent of the rise
[48:46.980 --> 48:53.740]  was before it. Total lie. But that's all they can do. Just like they said, they have my
[48:53.740 --> 48:59.620]  entire phone for all these years when they don't. It's not true. Mexico also suffering
[48:59.620 --> 49:06.860]  inflation. To stop inflation protests, Panama fixes prices of groceries and medicine that
[49:06.860 --> 49:15.740]  will cause food shortages. And it just goes on from there. Almost 40% of Democrats voters
[49:15.740 --> 49:20.060]  say Democrats have run the economy to the ground. See the Democrats look at the blame.
[49:20.060 --> 49:25.980]  Yeah, they deserve part of it. But their boss is the new world order. The great reset at
[49:25.980 --> 49:34.460]  work, the dystopian transformation of the food industry. Big article up on infowars.com.
[49:34.460 --> 49:40.660]  This is the designed controlled collapse. Meanwhile, China has said it's war if any
[49:40.660 --> 49:47.140]  high level US government official, including an ambassador, goes to Taiwan. Pelosi goes,
[49:47.140 --> 49:51.260]  I think she should go if she wants. She can visit wherever she wants. And she says it's
[49:51.260 --> 50:01.100]  because she's a woman. I mean, they inject that crap into everything. And it just goes
[50:01.100 --> 50:10.300]  on and on and on. But the good news is everywhere. Hollywood tried to force its leftist ideology
[50:10.300 --> 50:20.300]  on people. Get woke, go broke. Warner Brothers decides to shelve woke 70 million Batgirl
[50:20.300 --> 50:31.140]  movie. Economist warns job openings are about to fall off a cliff. That's just some of the
[50:31.140 --> 50:37.460]  economic news as they wage war against our finances, against our sustainability, against
[50:37.460 --> 50:43.420]  our independence against our children against our families. They're at war. You know, when
[50:43.420 --> 50:49.580]  I walked out of the courthouse yesterday, where they just said they had my whole phone
[50:49.580 --> 50:55.540]  and the law enforcement want to know about what was on it. And none of that was true.
[50:55.540 --> 50:59.980]  When I walked out there and there were dozens of TV cameras with people behind them hissing
[50:59.980 --> 51:04.260]  and saying hateful things and laughing and saying, you're going down. These are main
[51:04.260 --> 51:13.660]  line reporters. It didn't make me feel bad to have all these people saying mean things
[51:13.660 --> 51:25.620]  to me. It made me feel bad for them because of what they are involved in and the system
[51:25.620 --> 51:34.220]  that they have signed up for and how foolish they are and how they've bet on this as they
[51:34.220 --> 51:41.300]  said, January 6 is going to get your phone. You and Trump are going down. Oh, this will
[51:41.300 --> 51:47.860]  make Hunter Biden look like a good guy. All delusional, all based on half truths, all based
[51:47.860 --> 51:54.620]  on disinformation, all based on garbage, but they don't care. They don't stop. And they
[51:54.620 --> 52:00.860]  wonder why their lives are destroyed. They wonder why they have no future. It's very,
[52:00.860 --> 52:06.060]  very, very, very sad. Now, here's the other big news I'm going to be getting into, including
[52:06.060 --> 52:11.340]  right now. This is the good news. These are the real hearings that matter. Not that Alex
[52:11.340 --> 52:17.700]  Jones questioned a mass shooting or not that there was a riot at the Capitol and so we've
[52:17.700 --> 52:24.540]  got to have martial law. We should be spending the whole show today on this. And that's the
[52:24.540 --> 52:36.180]  gain of function hearings that they just had in Congress where they have all the documents,
[52:36.180 --> 52:42.820]  the government bureaus under George W. Bush and under Barack Hussein Obama. And then under
[52:42.820 --> 52:50.620]  Trump, he killed most of the programs to his credit weaponizing viruses to even be race
[52:50.620 --> 52:57.340]  specific and kill certain races of people. Big breaking news on that will be playing
[52:57.340 --> 53:02.100]  clips. Rand Paul, Congress is not allowed to know about top secret gain of function
[53:02.100 --> 53:10.620]  research committee. And we've got more on that. I love these modern articles in these
[53:10.620 --> 53:14.940]  studies. Evidence suggests genetic manipulation of COVID-19. And then they describe how it's
[53:14.940 --> 53:23.100]  got five P shuttle gene injections that show it's a cloned virus and that it's had other
[53:23.100 --> 53:29.700]  viruses added to it. I mean, you know a 57 Chevy's man made versus a redwood, or you
[53:29.700 --> 53:41.780]  know a duck is natural versus a carburetor. You know that a frog is biological and not
[53:41.780 --> 53:51.660]  man made for now versus a shotgun. And they knew this two and a half years ago. They scanned
[53:51.660 --> 53:55.900]  it at major universities and said, my God, this is man made. And now we have Fauci in
[53:55.900 --> 54:03.540]  documents admitting he ordered gain of function production. This could end humanity as we
[54:03.540 --> 54:07.780]  know it. Certainly kill hundreds of millions or billions of people and the fear and collapse
[54:07.780 --> 54:15.460]  from it will bring us into total collapse, which will lead to mass starvation and war.
[54:15.460 --> 54:20.460]  And that's today's live show headline. You know, you think our live show headline would
[54:20.460 --> 54:26.300]  be about Alex Jones and the truth about his phone and wasn't really true. But no, no,
[54:26.300 --> 54:33.060]  it's about all of us. Planet officially plunging into mass starvation, economic collapse and
[54:33.060 --> 54:43.660]  worldwide war. So I'm staying at my post despite the fact my guts and my flesh tells me get
[54:43.660 --> 54:50.460]  my family and run to the hills. Imagine being the idiots serving this system in the crime
[54:50.460 --> 54:58.180]  ridden collapsing cities they live in undermining their own future and thinking that those of
[54:58.180 --> 55:08.260]  us trying to save the ship are the bad guys. It is so sad. I'll say it again and the decision
[55:08.260 --> 55:16.700]  is really up to you. I know that if we cancel the war room and American Journal and lay
[55:16.700 --> 55:22.420]  off a bunch of crew, they will suddenly get a bunch of donations of support. Do you really
[55:22.420 --> 55:28.460]  want me to do that? Because I'm going to have to in a couple of weeks. I mean, do I need
[55:28.460 --> 55:35.620]  to, I mean, I'm in official full bankruptcy with the federal court filing things showing
[55:35.620 --> 55:41.020]  we're out of money. All I need is money to fight these next two show trials and pay for
[55:41.020 --> 55:44.940]  the bankruptcy and that will protect us and we'll be able to go forward. But we need the
[55:44.940 --> 55:50.260]  money at the level we were to operate. And that's why they flash headlines up everywhere
[55:50.260 --> 55:56.260]  that are 100% false that we have $5 million or $300 million or any of this crap because
[55:56.260 --> 56:04.820]  they want you to think that we have all this money when we don't. It is up to you to see
[56:04.820 --> 56:10.220]  through their lives. It is up to you to bolster the front lines of your defenses. We're the
[56:10.220 --> 56:17.180]  gate on the castle that the dragons shooting fire at and clawing at and trying to get through.
[56:17.180 --> 56:23.460]  Info Wars is the soldiers at that gate shooting arrows at that dragon and throwing themselves
[56:23.460 --> 56:30.900]  up there and moving boulders in to try to block the hole in the wall. That gate goes
[56:30.900 --> 56:40.060]  down. They're able to stampede and intimidate everybody. They take the whole fortress and
[56:40.060 --> 56:44.420]  believe me, you'll be in a whole nother world. Your money is going to be worthless. Your
[56:44.420 --> 56:48.700]  freedom is going to be worthless. You'll be under new lockdowns. You'll have no future.
[56:48.700 --> 56:55.140]  If you don't bet on Info Wars now, you are insane. And quite frankly, I'm exhausted.
[56:55.140 --> 56:59.340]  Part of me just wants to watch it, just give you guys what you want. But I know the listeners
[56:59.340 --> 57:02.980]  have been steadfast, you know who you are. But for all the middle class people and all
[57:02.980 --> 57:09.020]  the wealthy people that have been sitting on the fence while widows and blue collar workers,
[57:09.020 --> 57:12.740]  the salt of the earth of this country are busting their ass, spending part of their
[57:12.740 --> 57:18.100]  paycheck to buy our great products. Shame on the wealthy and nouveau rich that are sitting
[57:18.100 --> 57:22.060]  there thinking you're insulated. You're going to find out you're not in this new French
[57:22.060 --> 57:24.820]  Revolution.

[57:44.460 --> 57:51.100]  our number two with Roger Stone, Robert Barnes and more info wars has been vindicated. We've
[57:51.100 --> 57:55.660]  been proven right. World government, the new world order is out of the open. And now more
[57:55.660 --> 58:01.740]  than ever, the forces of Satan are trying to shut down this broadcast. The forces of
[58:01.740 --> 58:07.700]  anti human, godless new world order are out of control. So now realize we have pushed
[58:07.700 --> 58:11.420]  them out of the light. We have pushed them out in the open and they are so upset and
[58:11.420 --> 58:16.020]  they are so scared. So while you still can, because any day can be our last broadcast,

[58:59.380 --> 59:04.900]  most of them do it in a toxic way. Ladies and gentlemen, we went out and did deep research

[59:52.300 --> 1:00:08.780]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:08.780 --> 1:00:16.060]  The operating system of the sax coberg gotha families, which is the oldest bloodline of
[1:00:16.060 --> 1:00:21.180]  European bloodlines in the world in which all European bloodlines agree are their progenitors
[1:00:21.180 --> 1:00:27.940]  going back to their founder, Vlad the Impaler. Count Dracula is the recognized head of the
[1:00:27.940 --> 1:00:32.900]  entire dynasty. These royal highness prince Charles, who can trace his ancestry back to
[1:00:32.900 --> 1:00:37.380]  Romania's dark and distant past. The allergy shows that I'm descended from
[1:00:37.380 --> 1:00:42.940]  Vlad the Impaler. So I do have a stake in the country. As it were. And so this house
[1:00:42.940 --> 1:00:48.620]  of the dragon that flies the dragon, the dracool, rule the planet. Just like revelation tells
[1:00:48.620 --> 1:00:56.100]  us the dragon and it's allied with the other dragon, the chat comes and its goal is feudalism,
[1:00:56.100 --> 1:01:02.700]  though the high tech overlay. We're developing through technology and ability for consumers
[1:01:02.700 --> 1:01:08.660]  to measure their own carbon footprint. What does that mean? That's where are they traveling?
[1:01:08.660 --> 1:01:14.100]  How are they traveling? What are they eating? What are they consuming on the platform? So
[1:01:14.100 --> 1:01:20.060]  individual carbon footprint tracker. They tuned. We don't have it operational yet, but
[1:01:20.060 --> 1:01:26.460]  this is something that we're working on. Total biometric surveillance. We want to stop this
[1:01:26.460 --> 1:01:32.780]  epidemic. We need not just to monitor people. We need to monitor what's happening under
[1:01:32.780 --> 1:01:36.940]  the skin. And if you go back to the Aztecs or the ancient
[1:01:36.940 --> 1:01:41.940]  Chinese or the ancient Europeans or the ancient Africans, everybody behave the same. You had
[1:01:41.940 --> 1:01:47.820]  cycles and you would get cycles of society building up, developing technology, agrarian
[1:01:47.820 --> 1:01:52.300]  systems, developing towns and cities. And then the cults take over, the high priests
[1:01:52.300 --> 1:01:57.820]  take over and they always use environmental reasons for the reason that they have to dominate
[1:01:57.820 --> 1:02:02.540]  and demand human sacrifices and control over the public.
[1:02:02.540 --> 1:02:07.620]  So the Illuminati is basically just an extension of the mystery religion system, the whole
[1:02:07.620 --> 1:02:15.980]  type of philosophy. Yes, it was a way of hoarding knowledge and power to a few special people.
[1:02:15.980 --> 1:02:22.540]  And how do they hoard the knowledge? Well, when I say knowledge, some of the knowledge
[1:02:22.540 --> 1:02:29.620]  is pseudo-knowledge and some of the knowledge is actually scientific knowledge which enabled
[1:02:29.620 --> 1:02:37.580]  for instance Christopher Columbus to be certain that he could sail across the Atlantic and
[1:02:37.580 --> 1:02:43.620]  hit land. He was associated with the Knights Templars, which is one of these secret societies
[1:02:43.620 --> 1:02:48.660]  associated with the Illuminati. So you've got different types of knowledge, but some
[1:02:48.660 --> 1:02:57.220]  of the knowledge is actually bogus. It's just claimed so that they can get people to join
[1:02:57.220 --> 1:03:00.820]  whatever mystery religion they're trying to offer.
[1:03:00.820 --> 1:03:06.860]  And the UN and others at the Club of Rome in the 1960s, early 1960s, said we're going
[1:03:06.860 --> 1:03:11.900]  to bring back the superstition of the pagans. And we're going to teach people they're bad
[1:03:11.900 --> 1:03:15.100]  and teach them they're evil and teach them that they have to pay and teach them that
[1:03:15.100 --> 1:03:19.660]  old people have to die and babies have to be killed because there's too many people.
[1:03:19.660 --> 1:03:25.340]  So that we have a barbarous civilization that's the opposite of the Renaissance and Christianity,
[1:03:25.340 --> 1:03:30.540]  but one that is kill and be killed. And we believe this is the natural system of survival
[1:03:30.540 --> 1:03:34.820]  of fitness, social Darwinism. And so we're going to bring this back. And that's the real
[1:03:34.820 --> 1:03:39.420]  system we're transitioning to now we hear about a transition. So they decided to get
[1:03:39.420 --> 1:03:47.620]  rid of that and replace it with the old authoritarian model, a barbarism that has the exact same
[1:03:47.620 --> 1:03:54.740]  features, no matter what color you are or where your ancestors came from, humans act
[1:03:54.740 --> 1:03:58.580]  the same in these cycles over and over again.
[1:03:58.580 --> 1:04:08.580]  The satanic rituals that they carry out, which are horrendous traditional rituals, blood
[1:04:08.580 --> 1:04:20.060]  sacrifices, requires a certain level of insanity and disassociate ability. If you were a normal
[1:04:20.060 --> 1:04:27.900]  sane person and you had to participate in the higher level Illuminati rituals, you'd
[1:04:27.900 --> 1:04:36.100]  probably go crazy. It's absolutely essential that they maintain the bloodlines.
[1:04:36.100 --> 1:04:42.940]  These are religious sacraments to these people of power over you. And they don't like the
[1:04:42.940 --> 1:04:46.300]  fact you're straight and strong. They don't like the fact you're good. They don't like
[1:04:46.300 --> 1:04:49.940]  the fact you're hardworking. They don't like the fact you want justice. They want to hurt
[1:04:49.940 --> 1:04:58.860]  you. They want to dominate you to fill that empty spot in their heart.

[1:05:55.860 --> 1:05:57.860]  We're involved in an epic historic battle.
[1:06:05.860 --> 1:06:11.860]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:11.860 --> 1:06:18.860]  When you fight the globalist, you defend humanity. You stand up for the children in America. The
[1:06:24.860 --> 1:06:31.860]  New World Order comes for you. Yes, those that serve evil call us fools for standing up for
[1:06:31.860 --> 1:06:37.860]  what's right, but we can't help it. It's in our bones. And we've got incredible economic
[1:06:37.860 --> 1:06:43.860]  news. We're going to look at the big primaries that happened yesterday that are terrifying
[1:06:43.860 --> 1:06:47.860]  the establishment. We're going to look at the nationally televised hearings they had today
[1:06:47.860 --> 1:06:52.860]  where Roger Stone was drug into my Sandy Hook kangaroo trial where the judge has told the
[1:06:52.860 --> 1:06:58.860]  jury more than 20 times, I'm guilty. How do you get a fair trial of that? Just any other
[1:06:58.860 --> 1:07:04.860]  place in the world, folks, including America in the past, if a judge said you were guilty to a
[1:07:04.860 --> 1:07:10.860]  jury, it was a mistrial. So to break all this down and more is a man who's been through the
[1:07:10.860 --> 1:07:16.860]  fire even more than I have. And there's not many for what we stand up for is Roger Stone.
[1:07:16.860 --> 1:07:21.860]  But Roger, you're forced yet again. I had you coming on last night. I talked to you and we
[1:07:21.860 --> 1:07:28.860]  said, hey, let's get you on about the election, about the primary, about the midterms, 96
[1:07:28.860 --> 1:07:35.860]  days. But now yet again, they're not telling the truth. They say that there's a phone that they
[1:07:35.860 --> 1:07:42.860]  have bigger than Hunter Biden's laptop. And you're in it. And it's all there in the January 6
[1:07:42.860 --> 1:07:48.860]  committee. And it's a fragment of my phone given over in discovery in Connecticut with a bunch of
[1:07:48.860 --> 1:07:57.860]  text messages that is from late 2019 to early 2020. Nothing to do with January 6, but they don't
[1:07:57.860 --> 1:08:01.860]  care. They're going forward with it. Your response to that.
[1:08:01.860 --> 1:08:06.860]  Well, Alex, I have no concerns whatsoever about anything you and I have ever text message because
[1:08:06.860 --> 1:08:12.860]  you've never said anything inappropriate. We may have a comment on how attractive a particular
[1:08:12.860 --> 1:08:19.860]  woman is. There may be some locker room talk there. But even that's not troubling. Alex, they're
[1:08:19.860 --> 1:08:26.860]  going after you the same way they went after me for exactly the same reasons. We refuse to
[1:08:26.860 --> 1:08:33.860]  shut up. We refuse to be silenced. We refuse to stop talking about freedom and our constitutional
[1:08:33.860 --> 1:08:39.860]  liberties and calling out those who would cancel them. So my heart goes out to you and your
[1:08:39.860 --> 1:08:46.860]  family. I've been exactly where you are right now. And frankly, you need help more than ever
[1:08:46.860 --> 1:08:52.860]  before. Don't buy into the lies. Don't buy into the distortions. Don't be.
[1:08:52.860 --> 1:08:56.860]  They did the same thing saying you had hundreds of millions of dollars. All lies.
[1:08:56.860 --> 1:09:03.860]  Yeah, no, it's absolutely untrue. So folks, Alex Jones needs your support. Info wars need your
[1:09:03.860 --> 1:09:10.860]  support as never before. This is really, it's not even about the subject of the trial in my
[1:09:10.860 --> 1:09:17.860]  opinion. It's just never to silence and destroy Alex Jones. I've been there. I've walked this walk.
[1:09:17.860 --> 1:09:23.860]  I know what you're going through. And to watch the corporate media with these corrupt judges
[1:09:23.860 --> 1:09:28.860]  and others all working in concert. They truly are, as Trump said, the enemy of the American
[1:09:28.860 --> 1:09:35.860]  people. Well, here's the good news, Alex. Jesus Christ will deliver you just as he delivered
[1:09:35.860 --> 1:09:42.860]  me. Jesus Christ can discern good from evil. He knows who stands up for his values and his
[1:09:42.860 --> 1:09:48.860]  teachings. He knows that you are fighting to maintain this as a Christian based nation.
[1:09:48.860 --> 1:09:54.860]  My family and I are praying for you and your family. And frankly, everyone there at info wars
[1:09:54.860 --> 1:10:00.860]  never give up the fight. We want my friend. Let's talk about these primaries last night from
[1:10:00.860 --> 1:10:05.860]  Arizona to you name it. Let's run through it with one of the top political analysts in
[1:10:05.860 --> 1:10:13.860]  America. Well, what we saw in Arizona was the exorcism of John McCain and the McCainites.
[1:10:13.860 --> 1:10:20.860]  It was a top to bottom victory. At this point, Kerry Lake has covered carried every county,
[1:10:20.860 --> 1:10:26.860]  but one, of course, in Miracopa County. The last time I checked, they were still counting,
[1:10:26.860 --> 1:10:33.860]  but the nomination of Mark Fincham, his secretary of state, the resounding reelection of Wendy
[1:10:33.860 --> 1:10:42.860]  Rogers, the Republican establishment is crapping their pants across the board, whether it is
[1:10:42.860 --> 1:10:50.860]  Michigan, whether it is whether it is the house races. This is Donald Trump's party at the
[1:10:50.860 --> 1:10:56.860]  grassroots. All these stories that you've read front page story in the New York Times a couple
[1:10:56.860 --> 1:11:03.860]  of weeks ago about how Trump is losing his mojo at the grassroots of the Republican party
[1:11:03.860 --> 1:11:09.860]  that's completely disproved by yesterday's primaries. But here's the one thing perhaps
[1:11:09.860 --> 1:11:16.860]  the untrained eye doesn't notice. The turnout in Republican primaries are breaking all records,
[1:11:16.860 --> 1:11:23.860]  whereas the turnout in Democratic primaries is anemic to say the least. That shows an
[1:11:23.860 --> 1:11:30.860]  enthusiasm level, an intensity level that does point to a blowout victory this November.
[1:11:30.860 --> 1:11:39.860]  So their attempts to destroy Trump, you, myself, and Governor DeSantis and others is just a temper tantrum.
[1:11:39.860 --> 1:11:45.860]  Well, in the case of the January 6 hearings, there's no question whatsoever, this is actually
[1:11:45.860 --> 1:11:51.860]  galvanized and strengthened Trump at the grassroots. There's actually been a...
[1:11:51.860 --> 1:11:55.860]  Even the Atlantic, even the Atlantic, Politico did polls and admit that.
[1:11:55.860 --> 1:12:03.860]  Yeah, all the polling I'm looking at demonstrates a substantial uptick in the intensity of his
[1:12:03.860 --> 1:12:09.860]  support. I frankly think if they did this to dissuade him from running for president, it's
[1:12:09.860 --> 1:12:15.860]  having the exact opposite effect. I think that it encourages him to run for president.
[1:12:15.860 --> 1:12:19.860]  Let's be clear, you were here July 1st and said Trump was going to probably announce in July.
[1:12:19.860 --> 1:12:24.860]  He did say, I'm running, I'm just not saying when. So your prediction was true.
[1:12:24.860 --> 1:12:29.860]  Yeah, I still think this is coming. There's a lot of legal and political complications to
[1:12:29.860 --> 1:12:35.860]  his becoming a candidate this year. I do think he does not want to divert attention and support
[1:12:35.860 --> 1:12:40.860]  and money from the candidates who are on the ballot this November.
[1:12:40.860 --> 1:12:44.860]  I agree, but what about them wanting to indict him? If he announces now, generally they won't
[1:12:44.860 --> 1:12:49.860]  think this is too obvious. I don't think he'll divert attention. He should travel.
[1:12:49.860 --> 1:12:53.860]  He should get right back on the road. He should go into overdrive.
[1:12:53.860 --> 1:12:57.860]  Well, of course, the Attorney General said in an interview that they would not be deterred
[1:12:57.860 --> 1:13:02.860]  one way or another on his political status and as to whether he was a candidate.
[1:13:02.860 --> 1:13:07.860]  I don't think it'll make a difference. If I were him, I would announce my candidacy
[1:13:07.860 --> 1:13:14.860]  literally the day after these November elections, but that's just me. It's also interesting
[1:13:14.860 --> 1:13:21.860]  that even in those few places where Rhinos got reelected, it was only because the
[1:13:21.860 --> 1:13:28.860]  America 1st candidates were split or vote was split among two candidates.
[1:13:28.860 --> 1:13:34.860]  So for example, Dan Newhouse, perhaps the single worst piece of crap in the United States House,
[1:13:34.860 --> 1:13:38.860]  a guy who voted for impeachment, a guy who voted for the January 6th committee,
[1:13:38.860 --> 1:13:46.860]  a guy who voted for the COVID-19 database, this guy won only because the Trump vote,
[1:13:46.860 --> 1:13:50.860]  the America 1st vote, was split between two candidates.
[1:13:50.860 --> 1:13:56.860]  But if you add the majority, or I should say you add the vote they each got,
[1:13:56.860 --> 1:14:03.860]  he would have been a loser. Across the board, this was a smashing win for Donald Trump.
[1:14:03.860 --> 1:14:08.860]  Which is only going to make the deep state go crazier. What do you expect to happen
[1:14:08.860 --> 1:14:10.860]  in the next 96 days?
[1:14:10.860 --> 1:14:17.860]  Well, I'm not an attorney, although I did read yesterday that the president's lawyer,
[1:14:17.860 --> 1:14:22.860]  former lawyer, Pat Simplone, was summons to the grand jury.
[1:14:22.860 --> 1:14:26.860]  I don't know how they picked through the executive privilege issues there.
[1:14:26.860 --> 1:14:33.860]  Look, they seem hell bent on doing something that would disqualify Trump as a candidate.
[1:14:33.860 --> 1:14:36.860]  And I think that is growingly obvious.
[1:14:36.860 --> 1:14:43.860]  As for the attempts by the lawyers in the Texas case to somehow tie this into January 6th,
[1:14:43.860 --> 1:14:47.860]  I have no concerns in that area. As I have said many, many times,
[1:14:47.860 --> 1:14:54.860]  any claim, inference, implication, or accusation that I knew in advance about
[1:14:54.860 --> 1:15:00.860]  was involved in or condone any illegal activity on January 6th, just a lie.
[1:15:00.860 --> 1:15:07.860]  Nor was I involved in any of the legal machinations regarding delaying the Electoral College vote.
[1:15:07.860 --> 1:15:16.860]  But still, I get attacked on page one above the fold in Sunday's Washington Post.
[1:15:16.860 --> 1:15:19.860]  Well, that's right. The Washington Post, the New York Times,
[1:15:19.860 --> 1:15:23.860]  have all got front-page articles that it's over for Jones and Stone and Trump.
[1:15:23.860 --> 1:15:26.860]  We have the phone and they don't have a phone.
[1:15:26.860 --> 1:15:30.860]  They have text messages I turned over in discovery that they act like are like some big secret.
[1:15:30.860 --> 1:15:34.860]  It's just incredible how desperate they've gotten.
[1:15:34.860 --> 1:15:37.860]  Unbelievable. Thank God we're still here to tell the truth.
[1:15:37.860 --> 1:15:41.860]  Roger, stay there. I want to do another second one. You want to talk about Biden?
[1:15:41.860 --> 1:15:45.860]  They're clearly trying to get rid of him. Who are they planning to bring in?
[1:15:45.860 --> 1:15:48.860]  What are other tricks they're going to play in the next 96 days?
[1:15:48.860 --> 1:15:52.860]  The iconic Roger Stone's our guest. Stay with us, Roger Stone.

[1:18:20.860 --> 1:18:24.860]  We have come so far together. Please help keep us on the air.
[1:18:24.860 --> 1:18:27.860]  We're under massive attack right now, but we're going to win with your help.

[1:18:34.860 --> 1:18:37.860]  Some many, many years of research have gone into this.
[1:18:37.860 --> 1:18:42.860]  The Great Reset and the War for the World available right now at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:42.860 --> 1:18:45.860]  There's also signed copies available as well.
[1:18:45.860 --> 1:18:49.860]  We've got a lot of other big projects we're working on that are about to start launching as well,
[1:18:49.860 --> 1:18:55.860]  but this is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because it warns the world of the globalist plan.
[1:18:55.860 --> 1:19:05.860]  We are now living in the void sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what we've known and what's to come.
[1:19:05.860 --> 1:19:15.860]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is don't panic. Stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings
[1:19:15.860 --> 1:19:18.860]  and steer the ship onto a safe sound course.
[1:19:18.860 --> 1:19:25.860]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building our own society.
[1:19:25.860 --> 1:19:31.860]  All we got to do is survive the crash and right now we still have time to prepare.
[1:19:31.860 --> 1:19:35.860]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[1:19:35.860 --> 1:19:44.860]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water and survival gear to keep us strong and at the ready.
[1:19:44.860 --> 1:19:57.860]  Go to preparetoday.com for the essentials, storable foods, water filtration, first aid, power and more at preparetoday.com.
[1:20:14.860 --> 1:20:34.860]  We are now living in the void sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what we've known and what's to come.
[1:20:34.860 --> 1:20:51.500]  It was more than 30 years ago that I discovered the Globalist Plan and their documents, and
[1:20:51.500 --> 1:20:53.820]  I decided that I believed in humanity.
[1:20:53.820 --> 1:21:00.580]  I decided that if we warned the people and began a mobilization, we could defeat them.
[1:21:00.580 --> 1:21:04.860]  And now we have come so far together, we've got to continue on.
[1:21:04.860 --> 1:21:09.300]  Roger Stone, Joe Biden, that's obviously their big problem.
[1:21:09.300 --> 1:21:13.500]  They knew he was a puppet, but he's degenerated faster than they thought.
[1:21:13.500 --> 1:21:15.820]  That's the big wild card with 96 days out.
[1:21:15.820 --> 1:21:17.740]  Can he hold on?
[1:21:17.740 --> 1:21:20.740]  He's degenerating again at light speed.
[1:21:20.740 --> 1:21:26.540]  What is your intelligence sources and your own great research telling you?
[1:21:26.540 --> 1:21:33.980]  Well, an even larger problem, of course, is the constant Chinese water torture of more
[1:21:33.980 --> 1:21:41.260]  and more information about the illicit business dealings and perversion of Hunter Biden.
[1:21:41.260 --> 1:21:50.460]  If folks have not followed the extraordinary reporting of Miranda Devine at the New York
[1:21:50.460 --> 1:21:56.700]  Post, it is breathtaking and there's new information every single day.
[1:21:56.700 --> 1:22:02.020]  Joe Biden told us he knew nothing whatsoever about Hunter's business dealings.
[1:22:02.020 --> 1:22:07.420]  Turns out that he met with Hunter's clients on 14 different occasions.
[1:22:07.420 --> 1:22:14.900]  We have now absolutely established that he is the big guy and that he was getting a piece
[1:22:14.900 --> 1:22:16.260]  of the action.
[1:22:16.260 --> 1:22:24.500]  So the combination, it seems to me, of the disaster of the Biden administration policies,
[1:22:24.500 --> 1:22:34.020]  record gasoline prices, food shortages, crippling inflation, embarrassing defeats and retreats
[1:22:34.020 --> 1:22:42.820]  around the globe in terms of our foreign policy, Afghanistan, for example, combined with the
[1:22:42.820 --> 1:22:50.740]  weight of Hunter Biden's epic corruption, which, by the way, he is yet to be prosecuted
[1:22:50.740 --> 1:22:51.740]  for.
[1:22:51.740 --> 1:22:58.980]  I mean, Paul Manafort went to prison for lobbying without registering for Ukraine.
[1:22:58.980 --> 1:23:05.380]  Hunter Biden lobbied for several nations without ever registering, certainly had contact
[1:23:05.380 --> 1:23:12.580]  with policymakers and decision makers in Washington on their behalf, including his father, the
[1:23:12.580 --> 1:23:16.060]  vice president, he never registered.
[1:23:16.060 --> 1:23:25.620]  So you have to wonder when will he be prosecuted or do we have a two-tier justice system in
[1:23:25.620 --> 1:23:31.700]  which they only pursue Roger Stone, Alex Jones and, say, General Michael Flynn?
[1:23:31.700 --> 1:23:36.700]  Roger, I can ask a thousand questions in the six minutes we have left, but what else is
[1:23:36.700 --> 1:23:38.660]  front and center on your radar screen?
[1:23:38.660 --> 1:23:44.820]  Well, I think you raised the central question, which is how long will they put up with Joe
[1:23:44.820 --> 1:23:45.820]  Biden?
[1:23:45.820 --> 1:23:54.060]  In other words, once the New York Times and the Washington Post and the legacy media begin
[1:23:54.060 --> 1:23:59.700]  reporting on the epic corruption of Hunter, the handwriting is on the wall.
[1:23:59.700 --> 1:24:05.940]  So the only real question here is, when will he be removed under the 25th Amendment?
[1:24:05.940 --> 1:24:08.780]  Will that happen before or after the election?
[1:24:08.780 --> 1:24:11.900]  I would argue after.
[1:24:11.900 --> 1:24:21.940]  And does he pardon his son, his brother, perhaps even himself on his way out the door as his
[1:24:21.940 --> 1:24:26.940]  cost of leaving, as the condition of his leaving?
[1:24:26.940 --> 1:24:33.340]  If that happens, as you know, Kamala Harris immediately becomes president of the United
[1:24:33.340 --> 1:24:36.660]  States, no, she doesn't need to be sworn in.
[1:24:36.660 --> 1:24:42.180]  Lyndon Johnson did that famous charade on the plane of him being sworn in as president
[1:24:42.180 --> 1:24:44.700]  just to twist the knife in Bobby Kennedy.
[1:24:44.700 --> 1:24:47.060]  That's what that was about.
[1:24:47.060 --> 1:24:53.500]  She would then be entitled under the Constitution to appoint a vice president, but that vice
[1:24:53.500 --> 1:24:59.500]  president would have to be confirmed by both the Senate and the House.
[1:24:59.500 --> 1:25:07.340]  And therefore, in this next upcoming election, we don't know that that would be possible.
[1:25:07.340 --> 1:25:14.380]  That, of course, is an argument for removing Biden from office legally prior to the election,
[1:25:14.380 --> 1:25:18.860]  while they still have the ability to confirm a vice president.
[1:25:18.860 --> 1:25:20.180]  Who could that be?
[1:25:20.180 --> 1:25:28.020]  Well, I have said repeatedly, I think Michelle Obama is going to be the 2024 nominee.
[1:25:28.020 --> 1:25:32.660]  This would be a way to position her for that nomination.
[1:25:32.660 --> 1:25:38.500]  She would be the most likely nominee if that scenario were to play out.
[1:25:38.500 --> 1:25:40.620]  What are some of their wild cards?
[1:25:40.620 --> 1:25:43.380]  Provocateurs, false flags, new wars?
[1:25:43.380 --> 1:25:45.340]  I mean, they are in desperate straits.
[1:25:45.340 --> 1:25:49.420]  All the numbers show their own party is completely turned against them, so their own people don't
[1:25:49.420 --> 1:25:54.340]  go out and vote, even if they use dead people voting and illegals voting, just like we saw
[1:25:54.340 --> 1:25:58.380]  on last night's primary, that's not going to push them to victory.
[1:25:58.380 --> 1:26:03.380]  Well, I think we have to keep a very close eye on the monkey pox pandemic that they are
[1:26:03.380 --> 1:26:04.380]  openly predicting.
[1:26:04.380 --> 1:26:08.180]  Oh, you've been saying for six months, right before the election, they launched a new pandemic.
[1:26:08.180 --> 1:26:13.500]  They've already, blue states are already trying to shut things down and put masks back on.
[1:26:13.500 --> 1:26:18.060]  And I think they're looking for some excuse under which, theoretically, President Biden
[1:26:18.060 --> 1:26:23.380]  could sign an executive order that limits us to only mail in voting.
[1:26:23.380 --> 1:26:25.420]  And we know how that works out.
[1:26:25.420 --> 1:26:26.420]  And you predicted that.
[1:26:26.420 --> 1:26:29.620]  He just instructed with an executive order last week, the Puzzle Service Prepare for
[1:26:29.620 --> 1:26:34.060]  permanently delivering ballots via the mail.
[1:26:34.060 --> 1:26:35.060]  There you go.
[1:26:35.060 --> 1:26:41.820]  So, look, I think that they would like to avoid a free, fair, open, transparent election
[1:26:41.820 --> 1:26:43.140]  at all costs.
[1:26:43.140 --> 1:26:50.900]  I really think they recognize, particularly after yesterday's seismic results, that they
[1:26:50.900 --> 1:26:53.700]  are in deep trouble in the upcoming election.
[1:26:53.700 --> 1:26:56.620]  Spend two minutes on that because when we post this demand out video, I'm going to put
[1:26:56.620 --> 1:27:01.660]  this clip right now up front in your own words, how seismic yesterday was the primaries,
[1:27:01.660 --> 1:27:02.660]  Roger Stone.
[1:27:02.660 --> 1:27:08.060]  Well, first of all, just Republican turnout broke all records.
[1:27:08.060 --> 1:27:15.540]  There is extraordinary intensity and enthusiasm among all Republicans for these primaries.
[1:27:15.540 --> 1:27:17.580]  Democratic turnout was anemic.
[1:27:17.580 --> 1:27:23.660]  Secondarily, the Republican establishment, the Rhinos, got beat virtually every place,
[1:27:23.660 --> 1:27:28.740]  not only Arizona, but in Michigan and elsewhere.
[1:27:28.740 --> 1:27:33.740]  So the establishment knows that they are in deep trouble.
[1:27:33.740 --> 1:27:36.500]  There is a red-title wave coming.
[1:27:36.500 --> 1:27:38.500]  There is no question about that.
[1:27:38.500 --> 1:27:44.420]  And I think there is growing panic by the Democrats to figure out some way to head that
[1:27:44.420 --> 1:27:45.820]  off.
[1:27:45.820 --> 1:27:51.660]  Could it be a war sparked either through Ukraine or through these provocations with
[1:27:51.660 --> 1:27:53.940]  the Chinese conceivably?
[1:27:53.940 --> 1:28:01.700]  Could it be a pandemic that limits us only to mail-in voting and open invitation for
[1:28:01.700 --> 1:28:02.980]  voter fraud?
[1:28:02.980 --> 1:28:04.500]  That is a possibility.
[1:28:04.500 --> 1:28:07.220]  Here's the one thing that is absolutely clear.
[1:28:07.220 --> 1:28:14.380]  The Democrats cannot head in to a free, fair, honest, transparent election because they
[1:28:14.380 --> 1:28:16.780]  know that they will lose.
[1:28:16.780 --> 1:28:17.780]  I agree.
[1:28:17.780 --> 1:28:20.620]  I'm trying to figure out a headline, because we're live right now, millions watching.
[1:28:20.620 --> 1:28:23.940]  I want to post an abandoned video and get millions more to share it.
[1:28:23.940 --> 1:28:24.940]  What is the headline?
[1:28:24.940 --> 1:28:28.100]  Roger Stone.
[1:28:28.100 --> 1:28:33.940]  Primaries point to a November red tsunami.
[1:28:33.940 --> 1:28:34.940]  Absolutely so.
[1:28:34.940 --> 1:28:44.940]  Primaries point to November red tsunami.
[1:28:44.940 --> 1:28:45.940]  That's right.
[1:28:45.940 --> 1:28:46.940]  Perfect headline.
[1:28:46.940 --> 1:28:47.940]  Thank you so much.

[1:29:55.980 --> 1:29:58.580]  in an epic historic battle.
[1:29:58.580 --> 1:30:01.620]  Info Wars has been vindicated, we've been proven right.
[1:30:01.620 --> 1:30:06.500]  World government and New World Order is out in the open, and now more than ever, the forces
[1:30:06.500 --> 1:30:10.180]  of Satan are trying to shut down this broadcast.
[1:30:10.180 --> 1:30:14.620]  The forces of anti-human, godless New World Order are out of control.
[1:30:14.620 --> 1:30:18.740]  So now realize, we have pushed them out in the light, we have pushed them out in the
[1:30:18.740 --> 1:30:23.260]  open, and they are so upset, and they are so scared, so while you still can, cause any

[1:30:52.220 --> 1:30:55.860]  Thank you so much for joining us, and I'll spread the word, my friends, we're involved
[1:30:55.860 --> 1:30:57.940]  in an epic historic battle.
[1:30:57.940 --> 1:31:03.300]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual
[1:31:03.300 --> 1:31:07.900]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages, and the studies are all clear.
[1:31:07.900 --> 1:31:14.340]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom, and the
[1:31:14.340 --> 1:31:18.220]  number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[1:31:18.220 --> 1:31:21.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people
[1:31:21.900 --> 1:31:26.460]  having lasting, good, loving relationships, they want to break up society, and we are
[1:31:26.460 --> 1:31:33.660]  so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world available
[1:31:33.660 --> 1:31:35.420]  as a major sponsor now.

[1:31:58.100 --> 1:32:02.660]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria, or pump gas, or whether you're a farmer, a rancher,
[1:32:02.660 --> 1:32:07.820]  a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles,
[1:32:07.820 --> 1:32:08.820]  you see it every year.
[1:32:08.820 --> 1:32:14.060]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers,
[1:32:14.060 --> 1:32:19.620]  and almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[1:32:19.620 --> 1:32:23.260]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[1:32:23.260 --> 1:32:27.980]  this and knowing this, so it's a very important situation with inflation, and all the things
[1:32:27.980 --> 1:32:34.100]  out there hurting everybody, to be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful
[1:32:34.100 --> 1:32:37.180]  that allows you to keep more of your money, we wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten
[1:32:37.180 --> 1:32:40.780]  great tax advice in the last few years.
[1:32:40.780 --> 1:32:47.860]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com,
[1:32:47.860 --> 1:33:05.060]  or call 833-904-285, 833-904-285.
[1:33:37.100 --> 1:33:41.140]  Transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, U.S. resistance against a global corporate
[1:33:41.140 --> 1:33:48.060]  combine, empowered and funded by communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up communist China in 1949.
[1:33:48.060 --> 1:33:52.460]  The communist Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure, the
[1:33:52.460 --> 1:33:55.700]  communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood, the communist Chinese have taken control of
[1:33:55.700 --> 1:33:59.140]  the main universities, this is all confirmed, this is not a drill.
[1:33:59.140 --> 1:34:03.380]  Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the communist Chinese government, they've
[1:34:03.380 --> 1:34:08.980]  officially become state-run, Apple 100%, Google is now making the transition and announcing
[1:34:08.980 --> 1:34:14.660]  a merger in total worldwide censorship, they are now beta testing using me as the strawman,
[1:34:14.660 --> 1:34:18.580]  a demonized version of Alex Jones to do that, this is happening, this is not like the other
[1:34:18.580 --> 1:34:23.100]  probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would
[1:34:23.100 --> 1:34:28.260]  adapt to censorship by just putting up with it, now this attack is thousands and thousands
[1:34:28.260 --> 1:34:34.020]  and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks, this is a tight traded dose,
[1:34:34.020 --> 1:34:40.900]  reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion, paradigm manipulation,
[1:34:40.900 --> 1:34:45.220]  in layman's terms they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed, we adapt
[1:34:45.220 --> 1:34:51.620]  to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression, now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover
[1:34:51.620 --> 1:34:57.620]  we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept
[1:34:57.620 --> 1:35:03.060]  the dose, total internet of things, integration, global social score, complete command and control
[1:35:03.060 --> 1:35:08.660]  system, it is the virtual reality AI platform system, now attacking the united states with
[1:35:08.660 --> 1:35:13.220]  traders inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program
[1:35:13.220 --> 1:35:17.780]  and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the chai comm slash big tech banking
[1:35:17.780 --> 1:35:22.820]  combine emergency situation, I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information
[1:35:22.820 --> 1:35:28.260]  and have been battering ramming it out as much as I can, they want to double use me as they always
[1:35:28.260 --> 1:35:34.580]  do in any complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against
[1:35:34.580 --> 1:35:39.860]  us, so they take what I've said being sincere build me into an insincere person in the straw man,
[1:35:39.860 --> 1:35:44.020]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars and so they make me a
[1:35:44.020 --> 1:35:49.140]  herder of children and then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're
[1:35:49.140 --> 1:35:54.740]  actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones, so even if I didn't sell out
[1:35:54.740 --> 1:36:00.980]  to them they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction, I have now
[1:36:00.980 --> 1:36:06.100]  been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you,
[1:36:06.100 --> 1:36:12.020]  only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm, I have given you
[1:36:12.020 --> 1:36:23.460]  the transmission now break free, I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every
[1:36:23.460 --> 1:36:32.340]  form of tyranny over the mind of man, Thomas Jefferson, if you are receiving this transmission
[1:36:32.340 --> 1:36:44.100]  you are the resistance, you know it your guts, you understand it archetypally, any champions
[1:36:44.100 --> 1:36:49.380]  that stand up for human liberty and a pro-human future must be destroyed because the enemy can't
[1:36:49.380 --> 1:36:54.740]  have leadership, that's why supporting info wars, that's why sharing the links and articles,
[1:36:54.740 --> 1:36:58.660]  that's why praying for the broadcasts, that's why buying products and info warsore.com is
[1:36:58.660 --> 1:37:05.780]  beyond critical because we are your champions, you are my champions, if you hold me up, if you back
[1:37:05.780 --> 1:37:11.220]  us we will continue to have devastating victory against the enemy, but if you don't realize
[1:37:11.780 --> 1:37:16.500]  how important you are we'll fail, I played that clip because I shot that four years ago
[1:37:18.100 --> 1:37:22.420]  right after we were de-platformed, I shot it, it was a rant on a live show, that's unedited,
[1:37:22.420 --> 1:37:27.300]  they just added video over it, that's the spirit talking, that's total truth, that's the A game,
[1:37:27.300 --> 1:37:31.540]  that's what you live for, that's why you want the Holy Spirit, when you're in that zone it's
[1:37:31.540 --> 1:37:37.140]  incredible and they don't want any of us in that zone, this broadcast with our guests and our
[1:37:37.140 --> 1:37:45.860]  callers and myself and others, we are about getting into that zone, this is a focus on liberty and
[1:37:47.140 --> 1:37:53.460]  I talk about how they incrementally turn up the tyranny so you don't notice it like the frog in
[1:37:53.460 --> 1:38:00.340]  the pod till it's too late, we're about pointing out we're in the pod and just like I made that point
[1:38:00.340 --> 1:38:04.340]  they've been attacking us so long it becomes like yeah they took his banks away, they took him off
[1:38:04.340 --> 1:38:09.620]  the internet, yeah they attacked him, yeah now they want to arrest him, yeah, you just get used
[1:38:09.620 --> 1:38:13.780]  to me being chewed up, it's kind of like yeah he's down there getting chewed up, you don't realize
[1:38:13.780 --> 1:38:20.260]  I'm at the gate of the fortress defending you because I love you, I'm not a hero, I can't
[1:38:20.260 --> 1:38:26.260]  watch these people do this to you because I am you, I have a feeling of empathy just like you do
[1:38:27.860 --> 1:38:32.740]  so now I need you to take action and not procrastinate, yeah it's great to have the number

[1:38:42.260 --> 1:38:46.420]  but the money we get from that two three dollars a book is negligible, it's about
[1:38:46.420 --> 1:38:50.580]  our intellectual information being number one in their face showing the vote of the people, yeah
[1:38:50.580 --> 1:38:55.140]  Alex's war, there's some theaters around the country called the number six on the iTunes chart

[1:39:35.700 --> 1:39:40.260]  and go through that and show the courts that there's not all this money it'll all go away and show
[1:39:40.260 --> 1:39:44.740]  that it's just them wanting to shut us down which the Washington Post, the New York Times this week
[1:39:44.740 --> 1:39:52.260]  said the goal is to silence Alex Jones, they're using Sandy Hook families as pawns and I saw that
[1:39:52.980 --> 1:40:00.980]  two days ago when I did a live video in the morning saying I think Scarlett Lewis and I think Neil
[1:40:00.980 --> 1:40:05.540]  Haslund are real, I've been around them for over a week, we questioned all big events, we didn't
[1:40:05.540 --> 1:40:09.380]  create the Sandy Hook questions, the government lies did but I think they're real people and I
[1:40:09.380 --> 1:40:16.180]  believe Sandy Hook happened and I appreciate them and I'm sorry, they edited the tape to say I hated
[1:40:16.180 --> 1:40:21.140]  them, she got up on stand believed it, once she started crying said I'm sorry you're right oh my
[1:40:21.140 --> 1:40:26.340]  god and then her lawyers went over to her and to Haslund and snapped their fingers like they were
[1:40:26.340 --> 1:40:34.580]  dogs and said get over here yesterday, so they're panicking and that's why they came out with this
[1:40:34.580 --> 1:40:39.300]  fake phone thing, that's why they're doing it. Robert Barnes, you're riding the shotgun into the
[1:40:39.300 --> 1:40:42.900]  end of the next hour, thank you for co-hosting, you've knocked it out of the park, I don't want to
[1:40:42.900 --> 1:40:46.900]  talk about us all day, I want to talk about the elections, I want to talk about the primaries last
[1:40:46.900 --> 1:40:51.460]  night, I want to talk about the economy, I want to talk about Trump, Biden, Ukraine, everything
[1:40:51.460 --> 1:40:55.140]  but first you're loaded for bear on this, what do you make of the latest chicanery?
[1:40:55.940 --> 1:40:59.700]  What happened yesterday was an attorney admitting in court in this case the plaintiffs lawyer that
[1:40:59.700 --> 1:41:04.420]  he violated fundamental rules of the professional conduct and ethics that govern every lawyer
[1:41:04.420 --> 1:41:08.100]  and in the process was encouraging and incentivizing the January 6th committee
[1:41:08.100 --> 1:41:13.140]  to violate 4th, 5th and 6th amendment constitutional rights, so under the rule every lawyer gets
[1:41:13.140 --> 1:41:19.060]  information that's not supposed to be given to the lawyer, every day in America, I've got that
[1:41:19.060 --> 1:41:23.860]  many many times, I've been fortunate never sent anything to anybody they weren't supposed to get
[1:41:23.860 --> 1:41:28.260]  but I have received it frequently and my ethical and professional obligation when I see it's
[1:41:28.260 --> 1:41:33.140]  something I wasn't supposed to get is to let the other lawyer know, return the information and
[1:41:33.140 --> 1:41:39.140]  delete all copies, in fact this is so recognized, we'll later on you know talk about what Andy
[1:41:39.140 --> 1:41:44.100]  Griffith used to talk about in the 1960s, that's how well understood and universally understood
[1:41:44.100 --> 1:41:49.380]  this is, you cannot illegally benefit or profit from information you illicitly obtained even
[1:41:49.380 --> 1:41:53.620]  if it was by accident or mistake rather than- Especially if the lawyers tell you in 10 days
[1:41:53.620 --> 1:41:58.260]  they told them that day that's not right, send it back. Yeah it said I mean what it was communicated
[1:41:58.260 --> 1:42:02.900]  it was yeah that's a mistake discard the link and what does he do instead what this plaintiff's
[1:42:02.900 --> 1:42:08.260]  lawyer in particular has done repeatedly which is flay an ambulance chaser thoroughbred oh well
[1:42:08.260 --> 1:42:12.660]  I don't know if I put thoroughbred it looks more like you know a leprechaun on him on meth but I think
[1:42:12.660 --> 1:42:17.140]  he looks more like rubble stillskin yeah I mean one of the most disturbed human beings I've ever
[1:42:17.140 --> 1:42:20.740]  been around when I walked in the court he was hopping around like a like a bunny on meth
[1:42:20.740 --> 1:42:25.300]  screaming bobby barns bobby barns bobby barns this they put a clip of you yesterday yes they did
[1:42:25.300 --> 1:42:29.300]  they managed to only play five seconds I wonder why they wouldn't play the whole clip it's all
[1:42:29.300 --> 1:42:33.300]  the clips for five seconds exactly because the whole clip would have told the whole truth which
[1:42:33.300 --> 1:42:37.860]  would have it led to a hold on we're gonna play that clip you mentioned we talked about it of uh
[1:42:38.740 --> 1:42:42.900]  Andy Griffith and then we're gonna continue with this because this is insane completely the whole

[1:47:38.980 --> 1:47:44.260]  tape recorder just listen to this i can't listen to that but paul i can't listen to that i'm not
[1:47:44.260 --> 1:47:51.700]  permitted but paul you don't understand opi i can't listen to this now i told you about eavesdropping
[1:47:51.700 --> 1:47:57.220]  but paul this is different yes it's worse you overheard a conversation that was supposed to
[1:47:57.220 --> 1:48:03.860]  be private now i can't be a party to that but paul if you just listen to this opi i can't listen
[1:48:03.860 --> 1:48:10.820]  paul you're erasing a tape that's what i mean to do you bug the conversation between a lawyer
[1:48:10.820 --> 1:48:18.980]  and his client now that's violating one of the most sacred rights of privacy but paul no buts
[1:48:18.980 --> 1:48:28.980]  but if it helps the law opi the law can't use this kind of help and that's exactly what they've
[1:48:28.980 --> 1:48:33.300]  just done plus there's nothing there so that they lie about what's on the tape the next step
[1:48:33.300 --> 1:48:36.500]  well that was obvious because of the cross examination questions he tried to have his
[1:48:36.500 --> 1:48:41.700]  you know big you know perry mason fake perry mason moment uh the where he's trying to say oh i have
[1:48:41.700 --> 1:48:46.100]  some incriminating information and you're waiting for it and it's there's nothing that there was no
[1:48:46.100 --> 1:48:51.060]  incriminating information like i gave my lawyers my cell phone exactly and and and after looking at
[1:48:51.060 --> 1:48:55.060]  it stuff he's not supposed to have stuff he wasn't supposed to look at stuff he was supposed to
[1:48:55.060 --> 1:49:00.100]  destroy stuff he was supposed to return what can you come up with basically nothing i mean i mean
[1:49:00.100 --> 1:49:05.380]  that's it well they january 6th it even though it's text messages for 2019 right oh exactly which
[1:49:05.380 --> 1:49:10.260]  is the january 6th committee once again misusing and abusing its power and here they used uh the
[1:49:10.260 --> 1:49:14.980]  plaintiff's lawyer to illegally access and illicitly obtain information and those that don't know
[1:49:14.980 --> 1:49:18.900]  they're announcing they want oh oh yeah they're already that that's their nature that's what
[1:49:18.900 --> 1:49:22.980]  they're going to do but it is a violation of fourth fifth and sixth amendment rights and it shows
[1:49:22.980 --> 1:49:28.420]  how out of control the january 6th committee has become just as this trial i was talking to someone
[1:49:28.420 --> 1:49:32.180]  here in austin today doesn't have a bone in the fight doesn't really care it's someone that's a
[1:49:32.180 --> 1:49:36.580]  part of a well respected community here in austin and he had watched part of the trial and his
[1:49:36.580 --> 1:49:41.540]  reaction was he'd never seen anything like it that didn't they understand that they couldn't push it so
[1:49:41.540 --> 1:49:48.020]  far to make it look like a kangaroo court uh my occasional compadre viva fry who's a canadian
[1:49:48.020 --> 1:49:52.420]  lawyer again doesn't have a bone in the fight has has described as one of the worst trials he's ever
[1:49:52.420 --> 1:49:56.820]  witnessed and he's been critical of me before what she should be absolutely i mean he's not he's not
[1:49:56.820 --> 1:50:01.380]  part of the alex jones world he's just someone that's a canadian lawyer that had to flee canada
[1:50:01.380 --> 1:50:05.460]  because of what they were doing to his children in the vaccine mandate context but as someone who
[1:50:05.460 --> 1:50:09.860]  has an independent mind and his reaction response to watching this trial is that it is one of the
[1:50:09.860 --> 1:50:15.300]  worst kangaroo courts he could ever imagine and he's someone who's not prone to using a hyperbolic
[1:50:15.300 --> 1:50:19.860]  rhetoric it means that's what he is saying that's what he has witnessed i described it as 19th century
[1:50:19.860 --> 1:50:25.140]  australia is how this courtroom looks like which is all railroads and kangaroos and that's because
[1:50:25.140 --> 1:50:29.700]  that's what it is it is a case that has made a mockery of the rule of law it is disrespected
[1:50:29.700 --> 1:50:34.660]  did you see their closing arguments there so they go he said mr jones will stand this morning
[1:50:34.660 --> 1:50:41.380]  that fbi agents killed the children and i didn't even say anything like that no and my my lawyer
[1:50:41.380 --> 1:50:46.500]  and something goes he didn't say that the jury i mean the like this man makes 300 million dollars a year
[1:50:47.460 --> 1:50:51.460]  yes i mean it was one ridiculous statement after another ridiculous statement i remember the cross
[1:50:51.460 --> 1:50:54.900]  i was in the courtroom when they were cross examining uh oh and shroyer where they went
[1:50:54.900 --> 1:50:59.060]  kind of nuts and pointed me out and all that jazz it's bobby barnes deer they go look at him he's
[1:50:59.060 --> 1:51:03.380]  right there absolutely i've never seen anything like this i mean this just keeps they're like look
[1:51:03.380 --> 1:51:07.460]  he's right there why do they hate you so much the i mean he goes all the way there too they're like
[1:51:08.020 --> 1:51:12.660]  oh yeah i mean i think nobody's called me bobby since i was 10 years old so i mean it's some sort
[1:51:12.660 --> 1:51:17.300]  of peculiar obsession of a lot of these people and i think they don't like anybody fighting back
[1:51:17.300 --> 1:51:22.020]  in the court of public opinion they don't like anybody they have this weird camp following a
[1:51:22.020 --> 1:51:26.580]  people that look like mutants oh i mean when i when i i mean it it looks like house with
[1:51:26.580 --> 1:51:31.700]  thousand corpses all these weirdos following around this is a very weird group the vibe is very
[1:51:31.700 --> 1:51:37.220]  very disturbed i you know the i had not experienced that kind of negative weird vibe as some of the
[1:51:37.220 --> 1:51:41.380]  there were people random so-called press people in the courtroom that were busy staring at me
[1:51:41.380 --> 1:51:46.100]  half the time when i was there i mean it was just weird dynamic these are disturbed people in my
[1:51:46.100 --> 1:51:50.740]  view these are people that oh the new york times lady is so disturbed i mean all of the oh yeah no
[1:51:50.740 --> 1:51:54.100]  question she was more obsessed about asking any question other than a question that concerned
[1:51:54.100 --> 1:51:57.860]  the constitutionality of this trial and that's what we've seen all the way through and if we
[1:51:57.860 --> 1:52:02.180]  want to talk about people that have spread fake news that caused real harm probably nobody in
[1:52:02.180 --> 1:52:06.180]  the world has done more of that than the new york times they've lied us into almost every major
[1:52:06.180 --> 1:52:11.060]  war and conflict we've ever got into it's led to the deaths of tens of millions of people you could
[1:52:11.060 --> 1:52:15.380]  argue hundreds of millions when you include their cover-up of the soviet famine when you include
[1:52:15.380 --> 1:52:19.220]  their cover-up of aspect of what was happening with the Khmer Rouge with their cover-up of what
[1:52:19.220 --> 1:52:24.260]  was going on in communist china they are really they have real blood on their hands and yet here
[1:52:24.260 --> 1:52:29.220]  they are attacking and trying to demonize and take you off the air because you expose their
[1:52:29.220 --> 1:52:34.020]  lies that's what they're most concerned well the jury's out with the judge at least 20 times saying
[1:52:34.020 --> 1:52:40.500]  he's guilty you will find him guilty she read i never heard a jury charge like this man is guilty
[1:52:40.500 --> 1:52:44.580]  you will decide how guilty well i think zero hedge an article today put it well it's guilty
[1:52:44.580 --> 1:52:49.380]  until proven bankrupt i mean that's basically the nature of the what the court proceeding look like
[1:52:49.380 --> 1:52:53.140]  and that's where people who've watched it who have again don't have any major interest in the case
[1:52:53.140 --> 1:52:57.860]  or thought maybe i was overstating what was taken up taking place have written back to me saying
[1:52:57.860 --> 1:53:02.900]  they've it's far worse than i even described i mean the buy you had people on the left celebrating
[1:53:02.900 --> 1:53:07.300]  that the judges against alex jones the judge is supposed to be the referee imagine if you
[1:53:07.300 --> 1:53:12.180]  tuned into a football game and then the all the referees were wearing one team's uniform and telling
[1:53:12.180 --> 1:53:17.540]  one side they can you guys pull up we may have to bleep it for later next hour idiocracy court scene
[1:53:18.100 --> 1:53:22.500]  oh because that is fairer than this no doubt i well you tie it all in they want to build a
[1:53:22.500 --> 1:53:27.620]  world that looks like idiocracy news got on this computer go have them we've got a bleep version
[1:53:27.620 --> 1:53:33.220]  because i actually put when the judge defaulted me like six months ago i put a statement out on
[1:53:33.220 --> 1:53:38.660]  default we've got a bleep version at the end i mean it's that's fairer than this yeah absolutely i
[1:53:38.660 --> 1:53:44.180]  mean people have been sending me different clips of different crazy trials very kafka-esque trials
[1:53:44.180 --> 1:53:48.420]  and saying that these trials end up understating the reality of what it is to be well that's why
[1:53:48.420 --> 1:53:51.940]  they see me laughing in the hall and stuff and they go you're not taking this serious you're not
[1:53:51.940 --> 1:53:56.580]  scared i'm like dude we're already screwed of course i'm scared of you you're like cancer yeah i'm
[1:53:56.580 --> 1:54:00.820]  just like i'm already going down the ship i'm not like gonna sit there and bitch about it i mean
[1:54:00.820 --> 1:54:06.260]  as another person put the other day uh the uh another i think was dr benjamin braddock
[1:54:06.260 --> 1:54:11.300]  put out that you know the even a soviet show trial looked better than this trial in travis
[1:54:11.300 --> 1:54:16.420]  county texas and i think in my view the court overstepped its bounds the plaintiffs lawyers
[1:54:16.420 --> 1:54:22.180]  pushed the court too far and did things that look egregiously bad because they are egregiously bad
[1:54:22.180 --> 1:54:27.460]  all in an effort to not only use you as an example to intimidate people who raise questions about
[1:54:27.460 --> 1:54:31.860]  institutional narratives and expose organizations like the new york times that keep lying us into
[1:54:31.860 --> 1:54:37.140]  war and lying us into mass famines and lying us in the lockdowns and lying us into mass destroying
[1:54:37.140 --> 1:54:43.220]  me will rehabilitate them yes it will end it will shut out and suppress and censor for all time
[1:54:43.220 --> 1:54:49.140]  important and influential dissident voices it will intimidate i saw a tweet we'll cover it later it's
[1:54:49.140 --> 1:54:55.860]  like if they can't assange you they trump you know they can't trump trump you they outshines you
[1:54:55.860 --> 1:54:59.940]  exactly then that's precisely what's going on it's it's just a different level of it and the goal
[1:54:59.940 --> 1:55:04.580]  is to weaponize the legal system people forget this is how new york times versus solovan came about
[1:55:04.580 --> 1:55:08.660]  the way it came about was southern sheriffs corrupt southern sheriffs were suing civil
[1:55:08.660 --> 1:55:13.460]  rights organizations and related institutions that published civil rights organizations and
[1:55:13.460 --> 1:55:18.100]  trying to sue them into oblivion that new york this is the democratic party suing black people
[1:55:18.100 --> 1:55:21.780]  too that's exactly we're standing up to them and the democratic parties are the same trick they
[1:55:21.780 --> 1:55:27.060]  went after donors and nblacp versus patterson they went after civil rights organizations directly
[1:55:27.060 --> 1:55:31.060]  in new york times versus solovan they were doing it all over the place they're weaponizing the
[1:55:31.060 --> 1:55:35.620]  legal system to suppress censor and punish dissident speech so that the audience couldn't
[1:55:35.620 --> 1:55:39.940]  hear that voice and to intimidate the audience from supporting those independent voices that
[1:55:39.940 --> 1:55:44.420]  robert i can't help but i just i'm with the people i'm betting the people no matter what happens
[1:55:44.420 --> 1:55:48.180]  now we're gonna win at the end i think this is blowing up in their face i think so because
[1:55:48.180 --> 1:55:52.100]  anybody who watch these proceedings cannot look at that and say if i were alex jones whatever
[1:55:52.100 --> 1:55:56.500]  you they may think of alex jones what i want this judge is my judge what i want this court
[1:55:56.500 --> 1:56:00.660]  proceeding is my court proceeding what i consider this due process of law what i consider this
[1:56:00.660 --> 1:56:05.380]  protection of freedom of speech what i consider we can't even bring evidence in they just randomly
[1:56:05.380 --> 1:56:09.540]  brought stuff off my cell phone in exactly i didn't tell the judge well it's the reason why i called
[1:56:09.540 --> 1:56:13.460]  this is a five second clip of bobby barnes well that's why the exactly that's why i called it
[1:56:13.460 --> 1:56:17.860]  scripted they didn't want to cover the rest of that they wouldn't play any of the rest of that clip
[1:56:17.860 --> 1:56:22.500]  because they know that it's scripted when they won't let us put any evidence on but they can't
[1:56:22.500 --> 1:56:28.020]  it's scripted when you got three movie cameras staring at everybody in the courtroom well that's
[1:56:28.020 --> 1:56:32.020]  three movie cameras like 15 other news i mean oh there's other cameras in there there's a bunch
[1:56:32.020 --> 1:56:37.460]  of other production facilities going on the judge all mics up it's a live set it's literally a live
[1:56:37.460 --> 1:56:41.460]  set and when you're allowing even lets them shoot the jury last time i heard the jury
[1:56:41.460 --> 1:56:45.300]  wasn't asked permission that exact i didn't see any evidence of that and then there's literally
[1:56:45.300 --> 1:56:50.740]  i saw myself a camera staring right down at the jury oh he has a hbo has a big giant camera right
[1:56:50.740 --> 1:56:54.980]  aiming at the jury and these are movie cameras folks i mean the critical court cameras or small
[1:56:54.980 --> 1:56:59.380]  cameras giant notice like these are yeah exactly people tell me the camera this one guy has like
[1:56:59.380 --> 1:57:03.620]  a 500 000 camera oh those are expensive cam those are really like you're on a movie set like i said
[1:57:03.620 --> 1:57:08.260]  it looked like it's a movie camera it is and these are movie cameras of a movie production crew
[1:57:08.260 --> 1:57:11.940]  and what they're doing is they're using these are the cameras that are on tom cruise movies
[1:57:11.940 --> 1:57:15.940]  exactly and and they've designed a court it's like why is she letting in evidence that has
[1:57:15.940 --> 1:57:22.100]  nothing to do 90 percent because it's all theater absolutely it's her hbo debut exactly i mean if
[1:57:22.100 --> 1:57:27.140]  if this was a legitimate trial you don't have such selective uh evidence being introduced other
[1:57:27.140 --> 1:57:31.780]  evidence look bottom line the judge is the wicked witch of the west and the plaintiff's lawyers the
[1:57:31.780 --> 1:57:38.020]  flying monkeys i'm sure i'll see that in court tomorrow ha ha ha burn in hell new world order

[1:59:44.820 --> 2:00:06.660]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:00:20.900 --> 2:00:28.100]  by officiating the unproven theory that petroleum oil is a non-renewable fossil fuel the oil
[2:00:28.100 --> 2:00:34.500]  companies were able to adjust the price accordingly all the way into the peak oil scare told the
[2:00:34.500 --> 2:00:40.820]  calamity of the world soon running out of oil which forfeited the industry's oil pricing schemes
[2:00:40.820 --> 2:00:48.820]  the wells never did go dry and the ones once emptied filled back up so the science today
[2:00:48.820 --> 2:00:56.100]  favors the abiotic theory over the fossil fuel theory which is that oil is a natural renewable
[2:00:56.100 --> 2:01:03.380]  component of our ecosystem and we see this in our oceans underwater methane lakes deep
[2:01:03.380 --> 2:01:11.620]  beneath the surface with their own unique thriving ecosystems and so the story changed from the world
[2:01:11.620 --> 2:01:18.660]  will soon run out of oil to the world will most certainly end if we don't stop using oil and
[2:01:18.660 --> 2:01:24.980]  because nobody seems to know what science is anymore and most people just do as they're told
[2:01:24.980 --> 2:01:32.180]  the world is about to end for millions of people and probably more because our civilization is
[2:01:32.180 --> 2:01:39.620]  built upon fossil fuels and the powers that be are turning them off winter is coming and Germany
[2:01:39.620 --> 2:01:46.580]  is set to be very cold Angela Merkel saved her political career by appeasing the anti-nuclear
[2:01:46.580 --> 2:01:54.420]  movement and shutting down Germany's nuclear power out of 17 plants they have already shut down 11
[2:01:54.420 --> 2:02:01.460]  and are still in the process of shutting down the rest removing 25 percent of their power without
[2:02:01.460 --> 2:02:08.500]  anything to replace it because their green deal turned out to be a failure after all the hype
[2:02:08.500 --> 2:02:15.620]  Germany's dependence on fossil fuel is at 76 percent so they are temporarily switching back
[2:02:15.620 --> 2:02:21.300]  to coal and oil but that's a real problem because they've neglected their own fuel industry and
[2:02:21.300 --> 2:02:26.740]  become dependent upon russia's and the german government would rather have the country freeze
[2:02:26.740 --> 2:02:33.380]  to death than buy fuel from russia the german economy is based on highly innovative production
[2:02:33.380 --> 2:02:40.020]  which requires a great deal of energy that they no longer produce and so running out of fuel will
[2:02:40.020 --> 2:02:46.340]  quickly collapse the german economy which will cause a tsunami of economic destruction throughout
[2:02:46.340 --> 2:02:53.460]  the eu and the world and the german government is letting it happen they could leave some nuclear
[2:02:53.460 --> 2:02:59.540]  plants online but they still plan on shutting it all down by the end of this year to stay green
[2:03:00.100 --> 2:03:06.980]  some anti-carbon environmentalists are saying that nuclear power is the greenest option and maybe
[2:03:06.980 --> 2:03:13.700]  that's true but none of their schemes add up so far the green agenda has only successfully
[2:03:13.700 --> 2:03:19.220]  accomplished making people feel good about themselves while they destroy their own society
[2:03:19.220 --> 2:03:26.980]  the EU and britain are actually reverting back to burning wood as fuel and claim that it is carbon
[2:03:26.980 --> 2:03:33.620]  neutral which is a lie societies have steadily evolved towards a cleaner more efficient energy
[2:03:33.620 --> 2:03:41.300]  starting from wood the least clean and efficient and moving to coal followed by oil and gas and now
[2:03:41.300 --> 2:03:48.020]  nearly 40 percent of europe's renewable energy is wood which mostly comes from clear-cutting
[2:03:48.020 --> 2:03:55.940]  forests in the united states this new green deal is a complete lie it's just another part of the
[2:03:55.940 --> 2:04:04.420]  creepy elite's great reset these elite bloodlines want a new cashless society but one more like
[2:04:04.420 --> 2:04:11.300]  the middle ages which for these spoiled inbreds is the good old days and if they succeed it looks
[2:04:11.300 --> 2:04:17.460]  like germany will get there first and in the midst of all this chaos the german government
[2:04:17.460 --> 2:04:24.100]  is focused on allowing children age 14 and older to change their gender and first names
[2:04:24.100 --> 2:04:31.540]  without parental permission once a year for as often as they want reporting for info wars this is

[2:06:04.340 --> 2:06:17.540]  live from the front lines of the info war all right folks coming up in a minute we've got exclusive
[2:06:17.540 --> 2:06:23.380]  footage inside the austin courtroom of the kangaroo court that nobody has seen yet this is

[2:06:28.740 --> 2:06:32.900]  know what satire is this is a joke coming up robert i want to finish up with the kangaroo court
[2:06:32.900 --> 2:06:38.580]  to move into world politics the big primaries last night biden the war the economy but let's
[2:06:38.580 --> 2:06:43.620]  read a few tweets that are at the top these are some of the top tweets millions of retweets total
[2:06:43.620 --> 2:06:49.940]  robert barn says hate alex jones all you want but no one should welcome a trial
[2:06:50.500 --> 2:06:55.860]  that tramples the first amendment punishes speech about the second amendment ignores
[2:06:55.860 --> 2:07:01.700]  due process under the fifth amendment denies a trial by jury on truth under the seventh
[2:07:02.500 --> 2:07:10.900]  amendment and violates ac privilege turning client privilege here is jordan shantel the alex
[2:07:10.900 --> 2:07:16.980]  jones show trial is a preview of what the regime intends to do to anyone and everyone who doesn't
[2:07:17.540 --> 2:07:25.780]  conform to the narrative dr darin j beaty regime is thirsting for precedent alex jones case
[2:07:25.780 --> 2:07:29.860]  so no one can question official narratives on the internet again as it comes out they stay
[2:07:29.860 --> 2:07:35.060]  january 6 election wizard says well the texas justice system is doing to alex jones isn't
[2:07:35.060 --> 2:07:40.340]  justice it's wrong another commenter says the alex jones trial appears to be nothing short of a
[2:07:40.340 --> 2:07:46.260]  kangaroo court at this point scott adam says joe biden has done everything alex jones is accused
[2:07:46.260 --> 2:07:50.900]  of doing in the senate good trial making up stories that demonize specific citizens a dangerous way
[2:07:52.020 --> 2:07:59.620]  find people hoax russian collusion insurrection hoax name three the first one won biden the
[2:07:59.620 --> 2:08:05.460]  presidency covet 1984 says regardless what you think about alex jones please remember
[2:08:05.460 --> 2:08:11.380]  he was the canary in the coal mine for online censorship they deplat formed him and many were
[2:08:11.380 --> 2:08:16.740]  okay with it at the time how many people have been deplatformed since is this trial setting
[2:08:16.740 --> 2:08:22.180]  another new precedent and it just goes on from there robert barnes your take on that and we
[2:08:22.180 --> 2:08:26.980]  have a clip from the trial today i mean i think what you're seeing and witnessing is a travesty
[2:08:26.980 --> 2:08:31.860]  of justice but it's a precedent that is on uh very perilous for ordinary people's constitutional
[2:08:31.860 --> 2:08:35.860]  liberties and rights because if they can do this alex jones then they will do it to everyone else
[2:08:35.860 --> 2:08:41.300]  this is what we said back in 2018 and what happened two years later the president of the united
[2:08:41.300 --> 2:08:46.420]  states was deplatformed across social media so what they're doing here is showing that they can
[2:08:46.420 --> 2:08:52.100]  weaponize the legal system the way the old southern sheriffs used to do in the 1950s and 1960s
[2:08:52.100 --> 2:08:57.540]  to suppress civil rights dissident speech where they weaponize the local judicial system to create
[2:08:57.540 --> 2:09:02.820]  crazy verdicts and judgments in politically motivated cases that were contaminated by lack
[2:09:02.820 --> 2:09:08.100]  of due process and trial by jury here we're seeing the same thing but on an entirely different scale
[2:09:08.100 --> 2:09:14.900]  i have not seen a case that is so uh that has no regard for the rules that cover in the rule of
[2:09:14.900 --> 2:09:20.100]  law i mean just as one simple example just the other day they played a tiny clip of my uh prior
[2:09:20.100 --> 2:09:24.340]  presentation they failed to present the full context that's a violation of the rule of complete
[2:09:24.340 --> 2:09:28.740]  point of five second clip five second clip completely out of context wouldn't play the whole clip
[2:09:28.740 --> 2:09:32.980]  because the whole clip would actually undermine of course their case the rule of completeness under
[2:09:32.980 --> 2:09:36.500]  the federal rules and state rules of evidence requires that they play the whole and let's be
[2:09:36.500 --> 2:09:44.180]  clear they played a clip of me out of context saying i believe the kids died and i apologized
[2:09:44.180 --> 2:09:48.340]  edited to say i thought they didn't die basically and the judge wouldn't let us play the actual
[2:09:48.340 --> 2:09:53.940]  segment exactly so you've had complete by their own definition altered video evidence allowed to
[2:09:53.940 --> 2:10:00.740]  come in that creates a fake news story out of this theater of a trial for the future documentary
[2:10:00.740 --> 2:10:05.700]  that's going to be made that will be based on misinformation in the courtroom because only
[2:10:05.700 --> 2:10:10.340]  one side was allowed to be presented only one side and that one side often had altered videos
[2:10:10.340 --> 2:10:14.820]  and just another example the court suggested that somehow any statement ever made on info wars is
[2:10:14.820 --> 2:10:20.180]  a statement of info wars that's never been the case in order for there to be party opponent
[2:10:20.180 --> 2:10:24.260]  admission exception to hearsay evidence the person has to be a corporate officer and
[2:10:24.260 --> 2:10:30.260]  authorized individual not everything said on cnn makes cnn responsible for that statement
[2:10:30.260 --> 2:10:34.260]  the same is true here my statements are my own statements when i went on pierce morgan that's
[2:10:34.260 --> 2:10:39.700]  not their statements exactly that that would be like them suing pierce morgan and blaming pierce
[2:10:39.700 --> 2:10:44.660]  morgan for what you said in the interview with him that's how that has never been the rule of law
[2:10:44.660 --> 2:10:48.980]  that has never been the rule of evidence how have they gotten the judge who they just made the head
[2:10:48.980 --> 2:10:53.380]  judge of connecticut the one persecuting us she has been made the head judge of connecticut
[2:10:53.380 --> 2:10:57.460]  how do they get these judges to do this i think it's in part because the professional class has
[2:10:57.460 --> 2:11:01.940]  a class prejudice and bias against populist voices that challenge institutional narratives
[2:11:01.940 --> 2:11:06.260]  that's part of it the other part of it is there's a cultural a culture of authoritarianism
[2:11:06.260 --> 2:11:10.900]  within our judiciary that's very dangerous to liberty always has been going back many centuries
[2:11:10.900 --> 2:11:15.140]  that's right let's look at a few of these headlines it's on info wars.com exclusive
[2:11:15.140 --> 2:11:19.620]  the truth about the alex jones phone records and we have the actual documents there for you info
[2:11:19.620 --> 2:11:23.460]  wars.com get those and spread them here's the actual court filing on what really happened
[2:11:24.100 --> 2:11:29.380]  exclusive january 6 to many prepares his opinion alex jones text and emails that happened before
[2:11:29.380 --> 2:11:36.740]  january 6 a little fragment of stuff they have it's not my phone and it goes on and on and on
[2:11:37.300 --> 2:11:42.900]  so they are really really panicked what do you think the next minute before we play this clip
[2:11:42.900 --> 2:11:48.100]  of their attempt to claim i'm involved in perjury when i gave my phones over the lawyers there's no
[2:11:48.100 --> 2:11:52.900]  evidence whatsoever perjury perjury alex jones was innocent is innocent and will stay innocent
[2:11:52.900 --> 2:11:57.060]  they can attempt to railroad any court proceedings if they want it won't change that reality
[2:11:57.060 --> 2:12:00.580]  the look they i mean you talk about a gotcha moment when you set up a gotcha moment you're
[2:12:00.580 --> 2:12:04.500]  supposed to be an actual gotcha at the end of it there was no gotcha it was look at this and this
[2:12:04.500 --> 2:12:08.180]  didn't relate to anything that you had said it related to things that didn't even relate to sandy
[2:12:08.180 --> 2:12:12.820]  hook so the uh just because the word sandy hook were in it was like 50 different sandy hooks across
[2:12:12.820 --> 2:12:16.980]  america in terms of towns so it had no bearing on it there's no evidence of perjury there never
[2:12:16.980 --> 2:12:21.220]  was any evidence of perjury that's why they just have a headline of his him making the accusation
[2:12:21.220 --> 2:12:25.380]  but no substantive evidence because it didn't happen it's another fake news narrative about
[2:12:25.380 --> 2:12:30.260]  that's right we're gonna shift yours into the big primaries that happened last night
[2:12:30.260 --> 2:12:37.700]  biden ukraine is so much more but here is actual footage no no i'm joking this is satire
[2:12:37.700 --> 2:12:43.380]  this is less tyrannical than what we're actually facing here it is from the great
[2:12:43.380 --> 2:12:48.980]  mike judge's film idiocracy we'll be right back he would soon discover that in the future
[2:12:48.980 --> 2:12:54.100]  justice was not only blind but had become rather retarded as well
[2:12:59.780 --> 2:13:06.420]  i'm fixing to commensurate this trial here we don't see if we can't come up with a verdict up in

[2:15:10.740 --> 2:15:19.140]  big gales of stupid laughter there you go so they think they've got me on trial as you said they're
[2:15:19.140 --> 2:15:25.540]  on trial has been on trial in this case from the get go and unfortunately the verdict is in already

[2:20:33.780 --> 2:20:36.980]  i could ask a lot of questions but first what is front and center for you
[2:20:37.620 --> 2:20:44.020]  i think the risk for taiwan of war coming is gone way way up because of nancy polosi's drunken
[2:20:44.020 --> 2:20:49.380]  asian tour so you look at it alexander mccorris of the diran was pointing out that the great chinese
[2:20:49.380 --> 2:20:56.260]  concern is not taiwanese independence but is a nato or us a military base in taiwan or them having
[2:20:56.260 --> 2:21:01.220]  weapons that they would consider the west threatening china rather than the other way around
[2:21:01.220 --> 2:21:05.940]  and she said they're just scared of a woman no they've always threatened if any top tier leader a
[2:21:05.940 --> 2:21:11.300]  speaker of the house a senate majority leader or a president went that was war exactly and this goes
[2:21:11.300 --> 2:21:16.260]  back i mean we know the history i mean in the early 1800s china you know experienced one of its
[2:21:16.260 --> 2:21:21.540]  unparalleled unprecedented events at the time which was being devastated by the opium wars and foreign
[2:21:22.180 --> 2:21:25.780]  powers taking them apart in ways they'd never really experienced for those that don't know
[2:21:25.780 --> 2:21:29.700]  describe it there was like in 12 different sectors the french sector the british sector
[2:21:29.700 --> 2:21:35.380]  the us sector the german sector the dutch sector i mean that country got very humiliated oh it for
[2:21:35.380 --> 2:21:40.900]  a century from about 1820 1830 to about really the 1940s when saigon would literally had four
[2:21:40.900 --> 2:21:46.180]  different sectors run by four different countries its own prime city its cultural beacon was
[2:21:46.180 --> 2:21:51.140]  taken apart by colonial powers that was taking place the opium wars basically the british
[2:21:51.140 --> 2:21:56.420]  forced drugs onto the chinese population and use that to take over absolutely and so they remember
[2:21:56.420 --> 2:22:00.340]  that they remember the humiliation of it and the same things been done to us oh absolutely now the
[2:22:00.340 --> 2:22:04.900]  chinese ship fentanyl is a return oh exactly they consider they think in 200 years it's a return
[2:22:04.900 --> 2:22:09.300]  favorite yeah they do they're patient they're very patient and because of that the they uh what
[2:22:09.300 --> 2:22:12.820]  they're talking about i think you're not going to see an invasion of taiwan you're more likely to
[2:22:12.820 --> 2:22:17.540]  see a blockade of taiwan because they can surround they're already doing war games today
[2:22:17.540 --> 2:22:21.620]  where they're showing how they can do a blockade how they could shut down the air traffic shut down
[2:22:21.620 --> 2:22:28.180]  the sea traffic taiwan's entirely dependent on china for its economy they could crush taiwan overnight
[2:22:28.180 --> 2:22:32.420]  and what they're suggesting is that they will do so if they think the biden administration will
[2:22:32.420 --> 2:22:37.620]  stumble and bumble into some global war and the biden administration is not ready to defend taiwan
[2:22:37.620 --> 2:22:42.420]  is not ready to wage war on china we shouldn't be even like trump said why are we messing around with
[2:22:42.420 --> 2:22:47.060]  an possibility of a nuclear war with another nuclear power we should be focused on limiting china's
[2:22:47.060 --> 2:22:51.860]  social influence limiting china's economic not letting them buy farmland next to every military
[2:22:51.860 --> 2:22:56.420]  base exactly not letting him and openly putting up spy towers and not letting there will be swat
[2:22:56.420 --> 2:23:00.740]  teams in there right now oh complete and what if i set up a spy tower by military base what i'll
[2:23:00.740 --> 2:23:05.380]  never do i would be swat teamed in a week oh pentagon knows that's going on yeah you'd be
[2:23:05.380 --> 2:23:09.940]  swatted the very next day the uh and so that's what's taking place and they should know better
[2:23:09.940 --> 2:23:14.100]  but instead why are they letting the chinese set up spy bases everywhere i mean i think there's
[2:23:14.100 --> 2:23:19.780]  conflicting they want china to be their subservient little factory worker and because china's not
[2:23:19.780 --> 2:23:25.780]  willing to be so that's why you saw george soros last year call for regime change again g they
[2:23:25.780 --> 2:23:31.540]  they like the china communist party model they just want them to be subservient to the globalist
[2:23:31.540 --> 2:23:36.340]  agenda and not have their own independent agenda and they think they can cause regime change just
[2:23:36.340 --> 2:23:41.460]  like they thought they could do in russia but they're willing to risk global conflict global war
[2:23:41.460 --> 2:23:45.940]  global but obviously china is even bigger further russia oh no doubt about it well you now have
[2:23:45.940 --> 2:23:51.940]  russia investigating whether or not the covet nineteen was connected to a us aid program in
[2:23:51.940 --> 2:23:56.180]  wuhan russia has announced that they're inquiring whether or not the evidence that they've discovered
[2:23:56.180 --> 2:24:02.180]  from bio labs in ukraine has led to additional information that may implicate fauci and other
[2:24:02.180 --> 2:24:06.660]  connected parties while their congressional hearings finding the same thing so why are the
[2:24:06.660 --> 2:24:12.180]  globalist starting fights with the midwest conservatives rural people factory workers
[2:24:12.180 --> 2:24:18.100]  blue collar workers the russians the chinese trying to cut off people's beef i mean if i
[2:24:18.100 --> 2:24:22.980]  wanted to be a bad guy i would do it claus wabbs doing oh yeah no doubt he's like a he's a poster
[2:24:22.980 --> 2:24:28.020]  boy for evil but i think the nature of what their objectives are is their arrogance you have kind of
[2:24:28.020 --> 2:24:32.740]  intellect so it's total arrogance they're in their private jet trillionaire bubble exactly and you
[2:24:32.740 --> 2:24:37.380]  have intellectual incest it's like the hapsburg empire at the end remember when the their jaws
[2:24:37.380 --> 2:24:41.300]  were going like this and everything was messed up because the uncles kept marrying the nieces
[2:24:41.300 --> 2:24:45.140]  kind of like the egyptians at the end you can't marry in her family that long you can't have too
[2:24:45.140 --> 2:24:49.540]  many trees and with that genetically comes mental illness and arrogance exactly and what happened
[2:24:49.540 --> 2:24:56.020]  the austral hungarian empire along with the ottoman empire within four years between 1917 and 1921
[2:24:56.020 --> 2:25:01.380]  disappeared four five six centuries off that they had been established off the off the planet and so
[2:25:01.380 --> 2:25:04.740]  you're seeing the same thing now you have the same group of people at the top that don't know what
[2:25:04.740 --> 2:25:07.780]  they're doing that are willing to bumble and stumble us into war because their arrogance
[2:25:07.780 --> 2:25:13.060]  succeed either incompetence exceeds even their and then they send Pelosi to project power i mean
[2:25:13.060 --> 2:25:16.420]  if trump went to taiwan the chinese would have rolled over and crap their branches because they
[2:25:16.420 --> 2:25:20.820]  would have thought wow they really mean war right they send her it like it's enticing them to war
[2:25:20.820 --> 2:25:25.540]  yeah it's a bumbling stumbling effect at trying to control someone that they've unleashed they
[2:25:25.540 --> 2:25:30.420]  unleashed china they took china from five percent of global manufacturing in 2000 no electricity
[2:25:30.420 --> 2:25:35.140]  exactly the 25 percent of global fact manufacturing now they they are the leading manufacturing
[2:25:35.140 --> 2:25:39.380]  supplier in the world they control and monopolize many of the supply chains of essential ingredients
[2:25:39.380 --> 2:25:44.580]  in the world what they need our fuel and food and guess what what biden administration has just
[2:25:44.580 --> 2:25:50.020]  cut our power off while shipping a roll to them exactly and align china deeper with russia this
[2:25:50.020 --> 2:25:54.900]  means that you know what is where can they get fuel from russia where can they get food from russia
[2:25:54.900 --> 2:26:00.260]  where can they get fertilizer from russia so because general flam was right they'll get the
[2:26:00.260 --> 2:26:04.660]  russians on our side defeat china that was the obvious smart move but that wasn't done they've
[2:26:04.660 --> 2:26:09.700]  done just the opposite they've reversed the equation so that now china and russia are closer together
[2:26:09.700 --> 2:26:14.260]  than they've ever been before and the net effect of this is america is weaker and more at risk
[2:26:14.260 --> 2:26:19.380]  than ever before i agree the global minions are done but the higher ups know what they're doing
[2:26:19.380 --> 2:26:23.460]  i mean why do you think they're doing something so bad i think there are people that do understand
[2:26:23.460 --> 2:26:28.900]  what they're doing but they misread the landscape so i see the and the few that do read the landscape
[2:26:28.900 --> 2:26:32.500]  remember kissinger went to the world economic forum and said time to get out of ukraine you know we
[2:26:32.500 --> 2:26:36.740]  got to get an exit ramp this isn't going the way we wanted to but those people don't control right
[2:26:36.740 --> 2:26:42.420]  now the biden administration is what happens when idiocracy becomes right three months ago in the
[2:26:42.420 --> 2:26:48.180]  same week first the pope of the kissinger said we started to get out it's wrong which is it because
[2:26:48.180 --> 2:26:51.460]  they didn't want to take over russia they know they're losing like napoli and their hitler exactly
[2:26:51.460 --> 2:26:55.940]  they understood they had to get out it didn't work it backfired it was undermining the globalist
[2:26:55.940 --> 2:27:01.220]  agenda around the globe but it's too late because what happens when you put idiocracy in actual
[2:27:01.220 --> 2:27:05.620]  power we have a dementia candidate as president of the united states of america you get this people
[2:27:05.620 --> 2:27:11.540]  forget world war one we should be ramping up us energy production we should dominate what's trump
[2:27:11.540 --> 2:27:17.220]  knew exactly they have such a weird leftist hate of america and supremacy because the leftist
[2:27:17.220 --> 2:27:22.100]  didn't used to run it if i was evil and took something over i wouldn't hate it anymore be mine
[2:27:22.100 --> 2:27:26.500]  well like they have some type of they run the country and they're running it in the ground well to
[2:27:26.500 --> 2:27:30.820]  them america is just a tool it's just a weapon they don't care about american well-being american
[2:27:30.820 --> 2:27:35.540]  pride the american but don't they get its power is directly connected to theirs they should but
[2:27:35.540 --> 2:27:39.620]  they basically think of themselves as part of a global it's like let's say we're 200 years ago
[2:27:39.620 --> 2:27:45.220]  and i got a horse that takes me you know from my farm to the market and the horse is beautiful and
[2:27:45.220 --> 2:27:49.620]  it's strong and i'm kind of jealous of it so i shoot it the head well it doesn't even exist
[2:27:49.620 --> 2:27:54.340]  wait to think about it it's 1912 all over again you know in 1912 you know within a bet within a
[2:27:54.340 --> 2:27:59.860]  decade four empires the british empire the auto uh also the Ottoman empire the austral
[2:27:59.860 --> 2:28:03.220]  hungarian empire and the russian empire all disappeared off the planet of the earth because
[2:28:03.220 --> 2:28:07.140]  they were arrogant exactly and we've got the same thing now a lot of people had to go through some
[2:28:07.140 --> 2:28:11.860]  tough times i mean they unleashed not only world war one they unleashed the they planted the seed
[2:28:11.860 --> 2:28:16.180]  Hitler for global central domination in terms of banking and finding communism better reserve
[2:28:16.180 --> 2:28:22.340]  at communism fascism natiism all were a product of the decisions they made in 1912 and i agree
[2:28:22.340 --> 2:28:27.620]  mainline top historians admit we're at a world war one scenario right now that's exactly what we
[2:28:27.620 --> 2:28:31.860]  are and we have the same kind of incompetent corrupt elites who are willing to bumble and
[2:28:31.860 --> 2:28:36.740]  stumble us into global war and global famine in order to achieve their denuded and diluted objectives
[2:28:36.740 --> 2:28:42.660]  wow is there a way out of it robert barnes will give his great historical gravitas on this and
[2:28:42.660 --> 2:28:47.460]  we'll look at the big primaries that happened yesterday and the exit strategy for biden and

[2:33:15.700 --> 2:33:23.140]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from austin texas you're
[2:33:23.140 --> 2:33:39.060]  listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:53.380 --> 2:33:58.260]  we've got some big news to break right now but you already heard this for a year here so you're
[2:33:58.260 --> 2:34:02.660]  not going to be surprised plus you don't need me to tell you that you know in your gut we'll
[2:34:02.660 --> 2:34:08.580]  break it here in a second but first off during the little break i went up back and got another
[2:34:08.580 --> 2:34:15.860]  cup of coffee and i was thinking why do i feel so weird and why do i feel so calm and not worried
[2:34:15.860 --> 2:34:20.900]  about this jury out with them asking now for three billion dollars no it was 150 million
[2:34:20.900 --> 2:34:26.660]  yesterday in the afternoon they asked for three billion they say i make three i i make 300 million
[2:34:26.660 --> 2:34:33.380]  dollars a year and i'm sitting there it's like two million a year and i pay for all these lawyer
[2:34:33.380 --> 2:34:37.940]  fees and have nothing in fact i've been paid over a year in the bankruptcy that's going to come out
[2:34:38.660 --> 2:34:42.820]  like wow jones has never paid himself from over a year trying to keep things afloat and sold
[2:34:42.820 --> 2:34:47.780]  everything he had uh you know his main house everything because obviously i love this place i
[2:34:47.780 --> 2:34:51.860]  love my crew i love the the listeners what we're doing but i was sitting there during the break
[2:34:52.500 --> 2:34:58.820]  all the coffee was brewing at the cup and i was thinking what is this weird feeling i'm having
[2:34:58.820 --> 2:35:07.060]  it's this why am i not worried about me because the whole world's collapsing 64 million people the
[2:35:07.060 --> 2:35:13.300]  un estimates in the last 32 months starved to death from the lockdowns i'm not a starving african
[2:35:13.300 --> 2:35:18.580]  or somebody in venezuela and i feel sorry for those people because i know i'm next and so
[2:35:18.580 --> 2:35:28.740]  things are so bad doom is so insane that my problems are minor compared to other peoples but
[2:35:28.740 --> 2:35:34.260]  why are we important because we're exposing who's doing it and trying to stop it and that's why
[2:35:34.260 --> 2:35:39.380]  we're precious and that's why you're precious so i'm gonna tell you bottom line it's been a long
[2:35:39.380 --> 2:35:46.980]  fight and back in 2016 i just finished a divorce i had almost no money about 300 000 in the bank
[2:35:46.980 --> 2:35:51.620]  and with the type of bills i have and things that's nothing but my divorce was over you know
[2:35:51.620 --> 2:35:57.380]  took care of my ex-wife the court ordered it everything we had had to buy around the business
[2:36:00.500 --> 2:36:04.980]  but back then if i would have tried to push products like i do now we would have had hundreds
[2:36:04.980 --> 2:36:10.260]  of millions of dollars in surplus but i didn't and so i have this guilt when i get up here and
[2:36:10.260 --> 2:36:16.340]  i say we are down to the wire we could lay off people in a month we could start shutting down
[2:36:16.340 --> 2:36:22.900]  if you don't support us well i've been in such a long battle the last four years that a i get mad
[2:36:22.900 --> 2:36:27.780]  i didn't try to make more money back when i could we weren't any platforms and then b
[2:36:27.780 --> 2:36:35.380]  be a part of me just wants to just say okay i've done my job i tried but i can't give up
[2:36:35.940 --> 2:36:41.780]  so i have to come and beg you and i'm begging you because i don't want to give up and i know you
[2:36:41.780 --> 2:36:48.100]  don't want to give up to really understand don't listen to them we don't make 70 million dollars
[2:36:48.100 --> 2:36:54.260]  a year gross and we sell products that's only part of that's profit i don't have anything
[2:36:54.260 --> 2:37:01.620]  in any comparison to what they're claiming i don't do this for money i was offered glinbeck's
[2:37:01.620 --> 2:37:07.300]  job before he was created you see we have the number one political book right now the number
[2:37:07.300 --> 2:37:11.700]  one political film right now i'm gonna make money off that film other than the dvd sales we have here
[2:37:12.900 --> 2:37:18.420]  and i'm not bitching i'm just saying if i was trying to make money the kissager group tried to
[2:37:18.420 --> 2:37:25.700]  hire me in front of my producers 15 years ago i'm dedicated to you and this long battle people
[2:37:25.700 --> 2:37:32.100]  kind of get used to Alex Jones is always there and i've had family members who were just really cool
[2:37:32.820 --> 2:37:43.940]  like my dad's favorite uncle he had five had four uncles and and his dad so my great grandmother
[2:37:43.940 --> 2:37:50.740]  Moon Jones she was a Comanche Indian part of she was about 75 percent Comanche beautiful woman
[2:37:50.740 --> 2:37:59.620]  she was alive when i was a little kid and she had five sons and my dad's favorite was the youngest
[2:37:59.620 --> 2:38:04.660]  the baby Leonard Jones and man he was a badass he looked like John Wayne and they you'd see him
[2:38:04.660 --> 2:38:07.780]  they looked better than John Wayne he's like he was a kid like what the hell are these guys he's
[2:38:07.780 --> 2:38:14.180]  has a walk in the room all that six foot three freaking dark skin blue eyes black slick back hairs like
[2:38:14.180 --> 2:38:19.460]  damn these are the men that just arrived i'm like a men are getting weaker i'm like way weaker than
[2:38:19.460 --> 2:38:25.140]  those dudes they were like badasses like my grandfather was like to one point like the
[2:38:25.140 --> 2:38:31.940]  army boxing champion and i would sit there and see these guys and and the reason i raised that is
[2:38:31.940 --> 2:38:39.780]  is i see how far we've fallen and and and and what we've become and it absolutely disgusts me to see
[2:38:40.420 --> 2:38:46.580]  what these men fought for and what they were and what they did and to see us losing all that
[2:38:46.580 --> 2:38:50.180]  makes me disgusted and i forget the main point i was going to make about it it's just this
[2:38:50.740 --> 2:38:57.460]  that a lot of people fought for the freedoms we've got right now and everything they built
[2:38:57.460 --> 2:39:03.220]  and everything they did is being flushed down the toilet and i started telling the story about
[2:39:03.220 --> 2:39:07.540]  my dad's favorite uncle and i forget the story i was even going to tell maybe it'll pop back in
[2:39:07.540 --> 2:39:13.700]  my head in a second and i'll tell it next segment but it's just i can't let them down these were
[2:39:13.700 --> 2:39:19.380]  good men and women these were good people and they were the salty earth and if we had them now
[2:39:20.180 --> 2:39:24.980]  if we had your grandparents a great grandparents right now we wouldn't be in this position ladies
[2:39:24.980 --> 2:39:29.540]  and gentlemen barns i'm ranting here what do you want to get into next no i mean i i think it's a
[2:39:29.540 --> 2:39:33.780]  good point and i think the some people had asked should they continue to be supporting info wars
[2:39:33.780 --> 2:39:37.940]  given all of the things that are going on and the answer is yes and the beauty of the info
[2:39:37.940 --> 2:39:42.260]  war store dot com is it's something that makes you healthier wealthier and wiser regardless of
[2:39:42.260 --> 2:39:46.740]  the circumstances so that's the utility of it you there's something on there that you can find
[2:39:46.740 --> 2:39:51.140]  that is good for you that makes i mean it was amazing watching this trial where they were critical
[2:39:51.140 --> 2:39:56.420]  of this and i was telling somebody big big media is backed by big pharma big media is bad big media
[2:39:56.420 --> 2:40:01.940]  sells products that they have no idea they can't vouch for them they can't vet them right and often
[2:40:01.940 --> 2:40:08.100]  they're bad for people they make people's lives worse the food quality is decreasing our cognitive
[2:40:08.100 --> 2:40:13.940]  capabilities collectively across the globe trying to create a real world idiocracy so the genius
[2:40:13.940 --> 2:40:19.540]  and beauty of info wars model is you go to something that has been vetted that has that can be
[2:40:19.540 --> 2:40:24.820]  vouched for conscientiously and that does make you a better person that does make you a healthier
[2:40:24.820 --> 2:40:29.460]  person that does make you a wealthier person because you're able to buy product substitute for
[2:40:29.460 --> 2:40:34.660]  things you already are using or need to use you get it at competitive pricing and in the process
[2:40:34.660 --> 2:40:40.340]  you support independent content creation free of big pharma free of big corporate sugar daddies
[2:40:40.340 --> 2:40:45.540]  free of corporate control free of the censorship that also comes with that and it is empowering
[2:40:45.540 --> 2:40:50.500]  that is a model that can be replicated all across the world and marz four years ago i had you
[2:40:51.540 --> 2:40:55.220]  with an outside law firm look at our books and what did you find we don't have a bunch of extra
[2:40:55.220 --> 2:41:00.340]  money if you were worth 300 million dollars you wouldn't be here i mean that's the reality of it
[2:41:00.340 --> 2:41:04.420]  right i mean the reality of it is then you can buy politicians you can buy all the lawyers you
[2:41:04.420 --> 2:41:07.780]  want you can buy all the defense you want you can buy all the press you want you can buy all the
[2:41:07.780 --> 2:41:12.980]  coverage you want you are not an easy capable target you're only at a target because you're
[2:41:12.980 --> 2:41:17.940]  an authentic independent dissident voice and because you don't have tons of money but instead
[2:41:17.940 --> 2:41:23.460]  reinvested constantly in the ability to get the message out platforming new audiences platforming
[2:41:23.460 --> 2:41:28.100]  new speakers platforming new content creators to make sure that new independent information
[2:41:28.100 --> 2:41:33.300]  gets shared and they just saw the political effect of that the lead resistance to the lockdowns to
[2:41:33.300 --> 2:41:38.020]  the mandates to all of the illicit attempts to violate our core rights to put us under mass

[2:47:38.100 --> 2:47:46.260]  the u.s. declared health emergency over monkey pox outbreak mask lockdowns forced inoculations
[2:47:47.060 --> 2:47:51.860]  it's all being announced the blue states already started the new lockdowns the new mask
[2:47:52.420 --> 2:47:56.740]  right ahead of the midterms robert barnes yeah it's no surprise that's i mean why i'm working
[2:47:56.740 --> 2:48:01.220]  with bobby kennedy to sue the fda challenging children's health of uh children's health defense
[2:48:01.220 --> 2:48:06.660]  challenging the fda here in the western district of texas bobby barnes and bobby kennedy that's
[2:48:06.660 --> 2:48:11.780]  right exactly maybe that's where they got the bobby phrase theology from but the uh also suing
[2:48:11.780 --> 2:48:15.860]  in the eastern district of tennessee also suing on behalf of brook jackson against
[2:48:15.860 --> 2:48:20.980]  the fizer for its completely illicit ways in which it went about engaging in the clinical
[2:48:20.980 --> 2:48:25.060]  trials of the covet 19 vaccines what do you make a burks coming out and saying we knew the vaccine
[2:48:25.060 --> 2:48:29.060]  didn't work what a devastating admission extraordinary i mean and we have to wonder
[2:48:29.060 --> 2:48:33.140]  like credit to the attorney generals of louisiana in missouri now those suits by the way are being
[2:48:33.140 --> 2:48:37.620]  joined by the people from the great barrington declaration they are now adding their own names
[2:48:37.620 --> 2:48:42.260]  to the suit against big tech with their collusion with government particularly with fauci and burks
[2:48:42.260 --> 2:48:46.980]  and everyone else trying to suppress independent medical information and now the head of fizer it
[2:48:46.980 --> 2:48:51.940]  says we didn't know it would work we had courage and just did it they're so you bought off our
[2:48:51.940 --> 2:48:56.260]  government and made us take it in fact that's their defense their defense in the brook jackson
[2:48:56.260 --> 2:49:00.740]  case is it doesn't matter if they forged information if they fraudulently submitted
[2:49:00.740 --> 2:49:04.820]  certifications if they lied under penalty of burgery they submitted documents that were not
[2:49:04.820 --> 2:49:08.980]  truthful and accurate even though those documents were required and material and essential to the
[2:49:08.980 --> 2:49:13.300]  contract being issued in the taxpayer money being spent it doesn't matter because the government
[2:49:13.300 --> 2:49:18.340]  hasn't done anything about it afterwards so the ordinary person the taxpayers according to fizer
[2:49:18.340 --> 2:49:23.700]  can't seek any remedy or relief for their own criminal level behavior involved in covet 19
[2:49:23.700 --> 2:49:28.820]  vaccinations solely as long as somebody at the pentagon is wink wink nod nod in on it with them
[2:49:28.820 --> 2:49:34.260]  that is the claiming immunity completely the same thing what is the fda claiming so we're
[2:49:34.260 --> 2:49:39.220]  suing on behalf of young children say as young as six months old from being injected with this
[2:49:39.220 --> 2:49:44.260]  covet 19 vaccine that is not the traditional definition of a vaccine and their study's out
[2:49:44.260 --> 2:49:48.900]  at destroys your immune system absolutely not safe it's not and doesn't work their own clinical
[2:49:48.900 --> 2:49:53.140]  testing doesn't allow them to say it's safe their own clinical testing doesn't allow them to say
[2:49:53.140 --> 2:49:57.300]  it's effective so what's the real agenda behind these shots i mean we know they're linked to
[2:49:57.300 --> 2:50:02.020]  infertility i think on the legal side their main objective is simply to establish their
[2:50:02.020 --> 2:50:06.260]  right and their power over you that's right a month ago the fda said we may just start doing
[2:50:06.260 --> 2:50:11.220]  stuff without tests exactly in fact they are actually declaring that future boosters are going
[2:50:11.220 --> 2:50:15.540]  to be approved without clinical testing in the same standard that has been previously required
[2:50:15.540 --> 2:50:20.580]  so their goal is hey if we can't be sued if the fda can't be sued as long as they say emergency
[2:50:20.580 --> 2:50:24.900]  then why even have studies exactly they're just going to start scrapping them and this is an fda
[2:50:24.900 --> 2:50:28.820]  that turns around many of its key high-ranking employees and then go and work for the same big
[2:50:28.820 --> 2:50:32.820]  farm this is a revolution against due process and checks and balances and safety standards
[2:50:32.820 --> 2:50:36.900]  absolutely it's an attempt for the government to assert legal right and it was always the left
[2:50:36.900 --> 2:50:41.380]  that was for that now they're against it yeah absolutely i mean i will take whatever corporations
[2:50:41.380 --> 2:50:47.380]  say immediately that's liberal exactly they become big pharma propagandists and to the degree they're
[2:50:47.380 --> 2:50:51.780]  saying that they have the power i mean i had someone reach out to me in texas yesterday that
[2:50:51.780 --> 2:50:56.340]  their their wife is threatening their ex-wife is threatening that if they don't agree to
[2:50:56.340 --> 2:51:01.380]  inoculate their nine-year-old child that then there'll be negative consequences to that parents
[2:51:01.380 --> 2:51:05.460]  custodial rights that's what's happening all across the country so the goal and objective
[2:51:05.460 --> 2:51:09.460]  is to establish the legal principle and the legal precedent and the legal prerogative
[2:51:09.460 --> 2:51:15.300]  of the u.s. government to unilaterally declare that they own your body and your child's body and
[2:51:15.300 --> 2:51:19.940]  could put in it whatever they want whenever they want wherever they want however they want
[2:51:19.940 --> 2:51:24.260]  that sounds like the ultimate cult to me oh no question it's why you know this goes
[2:51:24.260 --> 2:51:27.700]  always back to the early 20th century the rockefeller foundation's obsession and its
[2:51:27.700 --> 2:51:32.100]  connection to the nazis the whole goal was to be able to show the state's right to control your
[2:51:32.100 --> 2:51:37.140]  body cloak it pink and purple hair and women judges and oh it's liberal oh absolutely and
[2:51:37.140 --> 2:51:41.540]  they make it about health and safety and protecting you're gonna cut yourself testicles off it's
[2:51:41.540 --> 2:51:46.820]  liberal well i mean there were Jewish ghettos that you would drive into during world war two and
[2:51:46.820 --> 2:51:50.980]  some way and part of the way they kept people from knowing what was going on in the nazi
[2:51:50.980 --> 2:51:55.140]  oppression of those ghettos particularly in parts of poland was they said uh this is a quarantine
[2:51:55.140 --> 2:51:59.700]  zone this is a public health danger so they've often used the excuse and pretext of public
[2:51:59.700 --> 2:52:04.420]  health remember they used it to take away the right of people to use natural medications while
[2:52:04.420 --> 2:52:08.820]  the nazis were busy giving all of their soldiers in their panzer division as much crystal meth as
[2:52:08.820 --> 2:52:12.020]  they could possibly absorb i mean you're even hanging out little chocolates with a little
[2:52:12.020 --> 2:52:16.980]  meth in it i mean just to get them drived up and roved up so you you have the state the goal is
[2:52:16.980 --> 2:52:22.340]  the state's control of our public health the state control of our public food the state control of
[2:52:22.340 --> 2:52:27.220]  what goes in our body and ultimately our body because if you don't own your body what do you
[2:52:27.220 --> 2:52:31.460]  own it's back to chattel slavery and the legal principles and purposes behind it and they're
[2:52:31.460 --> 2:52:36.900]  trying to reinstate this neo feudalism to recreate this new world order that puts them into the elite
[2:52:36.900 --> 2:52:41.780]  power in strips of strips us of all of our core freedoms that's right it's a revolution against
[2:52:41.780 --> 2:52:46.500]  checks and balances and civilization how do we counter it uh continue to well first of the
[2:52:46.500 --> 2:52:50.580]  court of public information there's a reason they're waging massive lawfare against alex jones
[2:52:50.580 --> 2:52:55.540]  and infowars because this works this works when people rallied all across the nation against the
[2:52:55.540 --> 2:53:00.580]  lockdowns it ultimately led to the reversal of those lockdowns when people protested in mass
[2:53:00.580 --> 2:53:04.580]  against now they're trying to bring them back exactly they're and they're gonna keep doing it
[2:53:04.580 --> 2:53:09.460]  because it's gonna be a constant test a constant tease how much can we get away with how much
[2:53:09.460 --> 2:53:14.180]  can we do how much can we achieve how much can we attain what's back to the early 20th century
[2:53:14.180 --> 2:53:17.780]  the big difference between now and then when i tell people that this should be a white pill moment
[2:53:17.780 --> 2:53:21.860]  not a black pill moment for what's going on in the world is nobody fought for the conny bucks of
[2:53:21.860 --> 2:53:26.100]  the world nobody she had cuz she had compromised counsel that was really secretly working for
[2:53:26.100 --> 2:53:31.220]  the other side nobody cared about the women that had their lives taken away from them their futures
[2:53:31.220 --> 2:53:34.900]  taken away from them their ability to have children taken away from them they're having
[2:53:34.900 --> 2:53:39.700]  ancestral legacies taken away from them nobody fought for them nobody did today millions of
[2:53:39.700 --> 2:53:43.300]  americans because they continue to share and support the information that that's right we've
[2:53:43.300 --> 2:53:47.700]  got major opposition that's why they're so scared oh no doubt and they think they can destroy a few
[2:53:47.700 --> 2:53:52.980]  of us that'll intimidate everybody i've noticed the more i fight the more we inspire people
[2:53:52.980 --> 2:53:56.980]  oh yes it's very much dylan thomas esk i told people the very beginning of all this is that
[2:53:56.980 --> 2:54:02.100]  those who believe that you know alex jones will simply go gently into that good night and not
[2:54:02.100 --> 2:54:06.340]  rage against the dying of the light as dylan thomas so eloquently stated for his father on his death
[2:54:06.340 --> 2:54:12.340]  bed is someone that's misunderstood who alex jones is and what inforce is about but as important
[2:54:12.340 --> 2:54:19.620]  what its audience is about this has been a half decade now of smear campaigns lies libel's defamation
[2:54:19.620 --> 2:54:27.460]  attacks attempts to de-platform attempts to de-person the individual dirty tricks every one imaginable
[2:54:27.460 --> 2:54:32.340]  and they have all failed to deter the audience from continuing because the audience is our will
[2:54:33.220 --> 2:54:37.540]  i'm just here if you want the fight to continue we need you to share the articles and videos pray
[2:54:37.540 --> 2:54:41.860]  with the broadcast and buy products and enforce where i come i'm leaving it all in the field

[2:54:47.300 --> 2:54:51.780]  right now and starting to duck under the water a little bit and start swallowing some water

[2:55:32.660 --> 2:55:37.940]  and that same principle in premise is is what the audience has kept and sustained and maintained

[2:56:27.460 --> 2:56:33.700]  balloting as the new york timeset in 2012 in august is an open door to various forms of shenanigans

[3:00:18.340 --> 3:00:24.260]  six minutes Robert Barnes tells you to me your host Alice Jones wanted to get to January 6 big
[3:00:24.260 --> 3:00:30.980]  article up on Gateway Pundit Ray Epps recruited me political president writes tell all letter
[3:00:30.980 --> 3:00:35.860]  from prison about his experience with the operative Ray Epps that they won't touch and now we've got
[3:00:35.860 --> 3:00:42.660]  more January 16. Yes Darren Beatty of Revolver has news that is inside information that the FI knows
[3:00:42.660 --> 3:00:48.580]  a lot more information about who the supposed January 6 pipeline was and really is other
[3:00:48.580 --> 3:00:52.980]  information and they're hiding that information and the question is why would they be hiding that
[3:00:52.980 --> 3:00:57.700]  information it was always sort of weird the whole dynamic of those pipe bombs that never went off
[3:00:57.700 --> 3:01:02.420]  they're easily discovered that they couldn't find the person they couldn't connect it to who it was
[3:01:02.420 --> 3:01:07.140]  there was a lot of inferences that maybe it was an inside job or someone who is an informant
[3:01:07.140 --> 3:01:12.260]  someone who is an instigator someone who is an infiltrator someone who is on an FBA FBI payroll
[3:01:12.260 --> 3:01:16.980]  directly or indirectly as many in the Whitmer and Trappman plot disclosed we're finding these
[3:01:16.980 --> 3:01:23.140]  sabotage devices too easily exactly I mean it reads like Pat Khan part two I mean goes all the way
[3:01:23.140 --> 3:01:27.460]  back to after the end of the Cold War the FBI needed an excuse for surveillance and big budgets
[3:01:27.460 --> 3:01:30.980]  and so their excuse was we're going to create a militia move in the United States it's going to
[3:01:30.980 --> 3:01:35.620]  be called Pat Khan we're going to infiltrate existing organizations recreate it ended up with
[3:01:35.620 --> 3:01:40.660]  informants and infiltrators connected to Oklahoma City cover that up for the better part of a decade
[3:01:40.660 --> 3:01:44.740]  and a half and when they couldn't get militias to do it they infiltrated motorcycle gangs
[3:01:44.740 --> 3:01:49.540]  and led them to order them to do it exactly and this goes I mean this goes back to her militia
[3:01:49.540 --> 3:01:53.780]  precisely I mean they did it at multiple levels and it looks like they're recreating it all over
[3:01:53.780 --> 3:01:58.820]  again redoing it all over again not only with the bogus domestic terrorism charges as FBI whistleblowers
[3:01:58.820 --> 3:02:03.540]  have exposed that they're trying to dummy up fake cases that don't exist or that it do exist but not
[3:02:03.540 --> 3:02:08.340]  as domestic terrorism cases or in the other context now we're seeing everything related to January 6
[3:02:08.340 --> 3:02:12.900]  they're hidden all the video 14,000 hours of video almost all of it hidden from public view
[3:02:12.900 --> 3:02:17.460]  what's on that video and now according to Darren Revolver there's inside information that reveals
[3:02:17.460 --> 3:02:21.700]  and discloses they know a lot more than they're telling the world about who that person was and
[3:02:21.700 --> 3:02:27.140]  this comes on the news that the Defense Department was up to something something they were so scared
[3:02:27.140 --> 3:02:31.540]  about they did what the Secret Service did after the John F Kennedy assassination and what Hillary
[3:02:31.540 --> 3:02:35.940]  Clinton did when she was caught delete delete delete delete delete so major problems and
[3:02:35.940 --> 3:02:41.460]  questions of corruption the FBI that continue to get out to the public well I just want to thank you
[3:02:41.460 --> 3:02:46.580]  for being here and the great crew keeping us on air 28 years folks and now we're halfway
[3:02:46.580 --> 3:02:51.380]  into 2022 and it's only you the viewers and listeners and your prayers and support to keep
[3:02:51.380 --> 3:02:57.860]  us on air so think about how critical Info Wars is today to how many things we've done we are
[3:02:57.860 --> 3:03:03.300]  writing the talking points to challenge the globalist here our information is being picked up
[3:03:03.300 --> 3:03:07.860]  everywhere our information is more important than ever so thank you for your word of mouth
[3:03:07.860 --> 3:03:12.900]  share the articles and videos more than ever please bribe the products at m4store.com and
[3:03:12.900 --> 3:03:18.500]  please spread the word about the broadcast it's so critical no doubt make yourself healthier wealthier
[3:03:18.500 --> 3:03:24.340]  and wiser because as I often say you need to hold the line and then and because the audience has
[3:03:24.340 --> 3:03:29.780]  held the line that's how people powered press continues to exist in America it only exists
[3:03:29.780 --> 3:03:36.420]  because you make it possible it only exists because you choose to take actions with your money with
[3:03:36.420 --> 3:03:40.580]  your words with what you do and there's this weird paradox now we're inside the new world order
[3:03:40.580 --> 3:03:45.380]  some people are like well okay it's real now you know no now's the time just because you're awake
[3:03:45.380 --> 3:03:50.180]  doesn't mean other people are people are really ready for this now now's the time to share the
[3:03:50.180 --> 3:03:54.820]  word now's the time to financially support the broadcast oh no no doubt about it I mean we have
[3:03:54.820 --> 3:04:00.420]  mass protests in the Netherlands mass protest in Panama mass protest in Sri Lanka the globalists are
[3:04:00.420 --> 3:04:05.460]  losing in a wide range of places all around the globe this is the time to continue to strike back
[3:04:05.460 --> 3:04:10.180]  the reason why they're so over the top so desperate criminalizing everything weaponizing the legal
[3:04:10.180 --> 3:04:14.980]  system to go after dissidents and key leaders in the dissident information source is because of the
[3:04:14.980 --> 3:04:20.980]  success of you the audience and the people in resisting this tyranny the answer to 1984 is
[3:04:20.980 --> 3:04:27.300]  always and still is 1776 you're the one that makes 1776 a reality because you have heard
[3:04:27.300 --> 3:04:32.340]  paul reveres cry and you've answered that cry and if you continue to then paul reveres freedom
[3:04:32.340 --> 3:04:36.660]  stays alive in america 10 second protection what do you think the jury comes out on my trial uh
[3:04:37.220 --> 3:04:40.980]  I think it may be a mistrial if it's an honest honorable jury I think that a mistrial is the
[3:04:40.980 --> 3:04:44.900]  most likely outcome given the nature of this particular case and the fact they weren't allowed
[3:04:44.900 --> 3:04:50.340]  to hear most of the real evidence bobby barns that's what his enemies call him he's robert barns
[3:04:50.340 --> 3:04:58.340]  thank you so much paul joseph watson takes over you're like myself and so many other people on

[3:06:13.700 --> 3:06:23.380]  transmitting from the summit studios in the united kingdom you are listening to joseph watson
[3:06:25.540 --> 3:06:32.500]  here's the fourth of august 2022 we are live once again and we are performing once again a kind of
[3:06:33.140 --> 3:06:39.460]  somber victory parade because we've been proven right yet again we warned during the initial
[3:06:39.460 --> 3:06:44.820]  lockdown phase we've warned during the furlough which in the uk was basically the government
[3:06:44.820 --> 3:06:51.620]  paying people to sit on their backsides and do nothing for about a year we warned that supporting
[3:06:51.620 --> 3:06:58.980]  the current thing in ukraine would cause economic devastation pain in the pocketbook and now they're
[3:06:58.980 --> 3:07:05.780]  talking about mass civil unrest and riots for years and years to come we see that being predicted
[3:07:05.780 --> 3:07:12.660]  in the uk what we see happening in spain is in a way even more absurd of course spain predicated
[3:07:12.660 --> 3:07:20.260]  much of its economy on net zero on the disastrous green economy over a decade ago that led to 50
[3:07:20.260 --> 3:07:27.380]  percent youth unemployment 25 percent general unemployment well now in spain they're being
[3:07:27.380 --> 3:07:34.100]  told by the government shops businesses hotels that they can only have their air conditioning
[3:07:34.100 --> 3:07:43.540]  at 27 degrees or higher at the height of summer spain's a pretty hot country by the way i just got
[3:07:43.540 --> 3:07:49.060]  back from greece which has an almost identical climate and as you can probably see almost burnt
[3:07:49.060 --> 3:07:58.980]  my face off we're talking 35 degree to 40 degree temperatures in july and august outside so now
[3:07:58.980 --> 3:08:06.980]  spain bans air conditioning dropping below 27 degrees celsius that's 80.6 Fahrenheit for you
[3:08:06.980 --> 3:08:14.260]  americans inside this is going to apply to all businesses all hotels all shops for the time
[3:08:14.260 --> 3:08:19.700]  being they're saying oh we're not going to make private citizens do it we've already seen in germany
[3:08:20.580 --> 3:08:27.940]  the association that controls around 460 000 properties a landlords association was saying
[3:08:27.940 --> 3:08:32.900]  they're going to directly control people's thermostats and yes you can do that now with smart meters
[3:08:34.180 --> 3:08:39.140]  and in private homes they're going to prevent people from having their air conditioning low
[3:08:39.140 --> 3:08:47.460]  enough to be comfortable 80.6 Fahrenheit indoors when you're working indoors that is not comfortable
[3:08:47.460 --> 3:08:53.140]  many people would say it's dangerous but again because spain vehemently supported the current
[3:08:53.140 --> 3:08:58.820]  thing with their socialist government they supported the lockdown their economy is now
[3:08:58.820 --> 3:09:05.140]  in a mess once again the tourism hasn't come back quickly enough so now they're having to impose what
[3:09:05.140 --> 3:09:11.140]  is basically energy rationing and we see this spreading throughout europe your on news reports
[3:09:11.140 --> 3:09:16.100]  the rules will be mandatory in all public and commercial buildings including bars cinemas theaters
[3:09:16.100 --> 3:09:23.780]  airports and train stations and again it's in the name of limiting dependency on russian gas
[3:09:23.780 --> 3:09:29.700]  that was a major reason for it but it was already in full swing before with the energy skyrocketing
[3:09:29.700 --> 3:09:36.580]  cost the inflation as a result of the economic devastation caused by lockdown no more was that
[3:09:36.580 --> 3:09:42.660]  enforced in europe than in spain where they literally had drones patrolling beaches telling
[3:09:42.660 --> 3:09:48.580]  people to get off the beach they had riot cops beating people in the face for not wearing a
[3:09:48.580 --> 3:09:55.620]  face mask they had laws which said at one point spaniards had to wear face masks in the sea while
[3:09:55.620 --> 3:10:01.460]  they were swimming in the sea it was a law that you had to wear a face mask outdoors for months
[3:10:01.460 --> 3:10:07.300]  and months in spain they weren't really totalitarian on this they wrecked their already fragile economy
[3:10:07.300 --> 3:10:15.460]  as a result and now this and the businesses the hotels the bars the cafes caught not enforcing
[3:10:15.460 --> 3:10:23.140]  this 27 degrees celsius minimum air conditioning indoors 80.6 fahrenheit if they don't do it they'll
[3:10:23.140 --> 3:10:32.660]  face fines of up to 600 000 euros 600 000 euros which of course would completely devastate most
[3:10:32.660 --> 3:10:40.500]  businesses in that country your news talk to andrea castillo will work at castey on university
[3:10:41.780 --> 3:10:47.540]  he said right now perhaps suggested by the heat wave you're experiencing i would say that 27 degrees
[3:10:47.540 --> 3:10:54.500]  will still be very hot perhaps we could work at 25 degrees but not at 27 and again as i had mentioned
[3:10:54.500 --> 3:11:00.420]  before germany's largest residential landlord which owns 490 000 properties will impose energy
[3:11:00.420 --> 3:11:06.500]  rationing that will cut heating to tenants at night they're saying in summer the air conditioning
[3:11:06.500 --> 3:11:14.020]  or in winter sorry can't be put above 19 degrees celsius which for many older people is going to be
[3:11:14.020 --> 3:11:20.900]  very dangerous meanwhile in the uk breitbart reports cost of living crisis inflation will
[3:11:20.900 --> 3:11:27.940]  accelerate to astronomical levels we had the bank of england come out today and basically say that
[3:11:27.940 --> 3:11:35.220]  we're heading into a at least a year long recession by the end of this year 13 percent inflation
[3:11:35.220 --> 3:11:41.700]  levels other think tanks are talking about 15 percent inflation levels people's energy bills
[3:11:42.660 --> 3:11:50.900]  have tripled or will triple at least by early january by 285 percent again with people already
[3:11:50.900 --> 3:11:56.260]  struggling with the fuel costs already struggling in terms of the impact that lockdown had on the
[3:11:56.260 --> 3:12:06.980]  economy 285 percent increase on energy bills dual fuel by january 2023 says the findings
[3:12:06.980 --> 3:12:12.500]  seen by the times newspaper said the growing economic crisis would see approximately seven
[3:12:12.500 --> 3:12:18.260]  million families living from paycheck to paycheck with gas prices and food costs are expected to
[3:12:18.260 --> 3:12:22.500]  drive inflation to at least 11 percent and again the bank of england saying basically 13
[3:12:22.500 --> 3:12:29.620]  percent recession by the end of the year which will last at least a year now what impact will
[3:12:29.620 --> 3:12:37.460]  this have well we had the poll tax riots back in 1990 where there were massive riot civil unrest
[3:12:37.460 --> 3:12:44.740]  especially in london that is about to return according to both campaigners and financial
[3:12:44.740 --> 3:12:51.780]  analysts widespread civil unrest looming in uk over cost of living crisis there's a whole
[3:12:51.780 --> 3:12:58.580]  movement now which some people have questioned because it has quite shadowy backing some suggesting
[3:12:58.580 --> 3:13:05.460]  it has george soros backing there's a whole movement in the uk being voraciously promoted by
[3:13:05.460 --> 3:13:11.460]  the mainstream media which is basically telling people from october 1st when these energy caps
[3:13:11.460 --> 3:13:19.300]  increase people paying around 1700 pounds a year for dual fuel to eat their homes that's
[3:13:19.300 --> 3:13:28.500]  going to rise to 3600 by january 283 increase on march levels this activist group is encouraging
[3:13:28.500 --> 3:13:34.900]  people across the country they say they've got 75 000 people signed up already they're raising money
[3:13:34.900 --> 3:13:41.540]  themselves from this of course it's called don't pay uk suspicious thing is though it's getting a
[3:13:41.540 --> 3:13:48.740]  lot of promotion from the mainstream media people have pointed out that if people don't pay their
[3:13:48.740 --> 3:13:54.420]  energy bills if they cut their direct debits from october onwards that's only going to cause more
[3:13:54.420 --> 3:13:59.620]  energy companies to flee the market it's going to create more of a monopoly and of course that's
[3:13:59.620 --> 3:14:06.660]  only going to lead to higher prices bp of course and shell have announced record profits a british
[3:14:06.660 --> 3:14:13.140]  petroleum its biggest quarterly profit for 14 years but again you have these hard left activists
[3:14:13.140 --> 3:14:19.380]  shifting all the blame onto the energy companies no doubt they share some of the blame but again
[3:14:19.380 --> 3:14:24.980]  they're only reacting to the energy crisis to the restrictions that have been caused by the
[3:14:24.980 --> 3:14:32.260]  economic sanctions on russia in the name of supporting the current thing you'll note now
[3:14:32.260 --> 3:14:39.700]  as i've noted that whereas in upper middle class areas across england people were very zealously
[3:14:39.700 --> 3:14:46.340]  click keen to express their support for the current thing the latest current thing to sanctimoniously
[3:14:46.340 --> 3:14:53.460]  virtue signal in support of ukraine by hoisting giant ukraine flags in their back garden now the
[3:14:53.460 --> 3:14:59.940]  places you'll see these flags aren't in poor areas in northern england you won't see many of them in
[3:14:59.940 --> 3:15:05.700]  you know barnsley where i near where i used to live or rather you will see them in the richest
[3:15:05.700 --> 3:15:12.740]  most privileged upper middle class areas down in the south in the southwest i've noticed some of
[3:15:12.740 --> 3:15:18.660]  those flags have started to come down now because even some of those people are starting to feel
[3:15:18.660 --> 3:15:24.660]  the pinch i'm going to come back in the next segment and get more into this because financial
[3:15:24.660 --> 3:15:30.820]  analysts and campaigners who are behind this don't pay group are saying that we could see a repeat
[3:15:30.820 --> 3:15:35.860]  of the 1990 poll tax riots which actually caused the government to reverse their policy
[3:15:36.580 --> 3:15:43.140]  and 51 percent of brits in a new poll think that there will be mass civil unrest at some point
[3:15:43.140 --> 3:15:50.180]  this year because people simply can't afford to pay their bills anymore summit dot news we'll be back

[3:16:10.420 --> 3:16:16.100]  answers and almost all of them just screw you over especially the big firms and and the big
[3:16:16.100 --> 3:16:20.660]  tax groups because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[3:16:20.660 --> 3:16:25.540]  this and knowing this so it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out

[3:20:24.660 --> 3:20:30.980]  so we have a cost of living crisis in the uk stack flation occurring basically rampant inflation
[3:20:30.980 --> 3:20:36.580]  with an economy heading into recession meanwhile of course we have our own government continuing
[3:20:36.580 --> 3:20:42.980]  to provide red carpet treatment and a free taxi service to record numbers of illegal migrants
[3:20:42.980 --> 3:20:49.380]  coming over in boats from france with iPhones they get free accommodation they get free food
[3:20:49.380 --> 3:20:54.500]  they get free money while the rest of the population the actual native population can go
[3:20:54.500 --> 3:20:59.620]  whistle they're now talking about civil unrest at some point this year and this is the first video
[3:20:59.620 --> 3:21:07.780]  on that subject cost of living crisis riots let's roll it unlike the french british people
[3:21:07.780 --> 3:21:14.980]  aren't very partial to rioting but when they do it can get pretty tasty on this day in 1990
[3:21:14.980 --> 3:21:20.340]  serious violence broke out in london during a protest against a new council tax called the
[3:21:20.340 --> 3:21:25.300]  poll tax such scenes could unfold once again as we approach autumn and winter with the fall out
[3:21:25.300 --> 3:21:30.260]  from the cost of living crisis threatening to boil over into the streets a shocking new poll
[3:21:30.260 --> 3:21:35.620]  commissioned by the more in common group is ringing the alarm bell a majority of brits think
[3:21:35.620 --> 3:21:41.940]  soaring energy bills petrol and diesel hikes and runaway inflation will lead to actual riots in
[3:21:41.940 --> 3:21:47.700]  major cities 80 think people will have to resort to shoplifting to keep their heads above water
[3:21:47.700 --> 3:21:53.780]  and 70 believe people will simply start refusing to pay their bills three quarters believe that
[3:21:53.780 --> 3:21:59.300]  people being unable to afford to heat their homes will lead to deaths i hope waving your
[3:21:59.300 --> 3:22:04.500]  ukraine flag was worth it exactly as predicted while the media has all but abandoned its
[3:22:04.500 --> 3:22:10.020]  interest in the current thing the actual impact of western countries throwing their weight behind
[3:22:10.020 --> 3:22:16.420]  prolonging that war will lead to financial bedlam and poverty for many for years to come we all
[3:22:16.420 --> 3:22:22.500]  warned this would happen and we were all told to shut up and support ukraine while now it's happening
[3:22:22.500 --> 3:22:27.460]  mp alex shellbrook described what he was seeing on the ground in his west yorkshire constituency
[3:22:27.460 --> 3:22:32.980]  quote what i've been seeing on the doorstep for the last six months is absolute fear in people's
[3:22:32.980 --> 3:22:37.780]  eyes they are terrified as to what is coming down the line they don't know how they're going to pay
[3:22:37.780 --> 3:22:43.620]  it the tax burden on the average brit now stands at a 70 year high the resolution foundation says
[3:22:43.620 --> 3:22:50.260]  inflation in the uk will hit 15 percent next year massive increases in fuel and energy bills are set
[3:22:50.260 --> 3:22:56.980]  to soar well into 2023 oh bp's doing just fine though they just reported their biggest quarterly
[3:22:56.980 --> 3:23:03.380]  profit for 14 years nearly seven billion pounds between april and june more than triple the amount
[3:23:03.380 --> 3:23:08.900]  it made in the same period last year people are becoming increasingly destitute increasingly
[3:23:08.900 --> 3:23:14.100]  desperate as what little income they have continued to evaporate families are being forced to choose
[3:23:14.100 --> 3:23:19.540]  between paying the electricity bill or putting food on the table oh but at least pretentious
[3:23:19.540 --> 3:23:25.460]  upper middle class virtue signalers got to feel good about themselves by hoisting ukraine flags
[3:23:25.460 --> 3:23:32.180]  in their back gardens at least we all supported the current thing and at what cost well we're about
[3:23:32.180 --> 3:23:37.380]  to find out aren't we how are you coping with runaway inflation and the cost of living crisis
[3:23:37.380 --> 3:23:42.660]  how are you planning to save money by just turning the heating off are you on the edge of poverty
[3:23:42.660 --> 3:23:49.140]  i'll be reading your responses in the comments below now of course the uk is a little different
[3:23:49.140 --> 3:23:53.860]  to america because in america although of course democrats continually deny it their
[3:23:53.860 --> 3:23:59.620]  runaway inflation was occurring before the russian invasion of ukraine in the uk though and
[3:23:59.620 --> 3:24:05.380]  generally in europe the inflation skyrocketed immediately after that invasion and immediately
[3:24:05.380 --> 3:24:11.060]  after our governments of course pledged basically to prolong the war in ukraine so again you got
[3:24:11.060 --> 3:24:16.660]  left wing groups blaming energy companies completely omitting the fact that it was our
[3:24:16.660 --> 3:24:23.220]  government and it was their uh current thing mantra in general that precipitated this crisis of
[3:24:23.220 --> 3:24:29.860]  course the lockdown exacerbated it the furlough exacerbated it prolonging the war in ukraine
[3:24:29.860 --> 3:24:35.700]  exacerbated it all things that the hard left in this country and many other countries supported
[3:24:36.260 --> 3:24:42.180]  meanwhile in america poll finds only one percent of americans see russia as major problem one percent
[3:24:42.180 --> 3:24:49.380]  were 17 percent the inflation as the most important problem meanwhile biden administration to declare
[3:24:49.380 --> 3:24:56.820]  monkeypox a public health emergency that just came out a couple of hours ago and yet the san francisco
[3:24:56.820 --> 3:25:03.060]  public health authorities declared a monkeypox emergency there yet they encouraged gay orgies
[3:25:03.060 --> 3:25:09.380]  to continue and this is a video we have on that subject this is called san francico let's roll it
[3:25:09.380 --> 3:25:17.780]  it crime plagued junky infested whole san francisco is being very well san francisco
[3:25:17.780 --> 3:25:22.900]  last week city officials declared a public health emergency over the spread of monkeypox
[3:25:22.900 --> 3:25:27.780]  remember when they did a similar thing for covet you weren't allowed to visit your dying grandparents
[3:25:27.780 --> 3:25:32.500]  you weren't allowed to attend their funerals you weren't allowed to go to the theater the gym
[3:25:32.500 --> 3:25:37.620]  you weren't allowed to attend church but a public health emergency over a virus that almost
[3:25:37.620 --> 3:25:43.380]  exclusively affects gay men what advice did public health bodies give in san francisco go out and
[3:25:43.380 --> 3:25:50.900]  congregate with thousands of random people and enjoy homosexual orgies yes really san francisco's
[3:25:50.900 --> 3:25:57.780]  king confetish festival also known as door alley went ahead as normal before the event state senator
[3:25:57.780 --> 3:26:03.780]  scott weiner shared a handy helpful guide which explained how despite the spread of monkeypox
[3:26:03.780 --> 3:26:09.620]  people should continue to engage in degenerate group fornication with multiple people at sex
[3:26:09.620 --> 3:26:14.740]  parties take a friend to the dungeon going to sex parties with people you know and planning on who
[3:26:14.740 --> 3:26:18.900]  you'll hook up with can be one way to reduce your risk if you're able to have open and honest
[3:26:18.900 --> 3:26:24.020]  conversations about monkeypox symptoms and possible exposures talk to the people you'll play with
[3:26:24.020 --> 3:26:29.620]  ahead of time about monkeypox but also things like hiv prep and sexual health testing keep in mind
[3:26:29.620 --> 3:26:35.060]  that condoms can reduce risk of monkeypox but not eliminate risk entirely since monkeypox
[3:26:35.060 --> 3:26:41.060]  rashes legions can show up all over the body lovely stuff they even told gays who think
[3:26:41.060 --> 3:26:47.060]  they might have monkeypox to merely cover up their bumps before attending the orgies again
[3:26:47.060 --> 3:26:52.420]  all in the middle of a public health emergency over a virus that is almost exclusively only
[3:26:52.420 --> 3:26:58.660]  infected gay men this is the equivalent of telling elderly care home residents during the first wave
[3:26:58.660 --> 3:27:04.340]  of covid to just pop down to their nearest neighbouring care home and shag all the other elderly
[3:27:04.340 --> 3:27:10.180]  residents once more we see political correctness being elevated way above public health lest we
[3:27:10.180 --> 3:27:15.460]  forget the first british monkeypox patient who openly admitted he caught it after having gay sex
[3:27:15.460 --> 3:27:20.980]  with 10 new partners in the space of one vacation the world health organization said that summer
[3:27:20.980 --> 3:27:26.340]  festivals should be limited to stop the spread of monkeypox oh but not gay pride parades which it
[3:27:26.340 --> 3:27:33.300]  said should go full steam ahead again despite 99 percent of monkeypox cases being gay men the who
[3:27:33.300 --> 3:27:38.500]  was seemingly more concerned about the deadly threat posed by racism as a result of the virus
[3:27:38.500 --> 3:27:42.900]  being called monkeypox in the first place and don't forget this is all happening while they
[3:27:42.900 --> 3:27:48.180]  prepare to ramp up mask mandates yet again and get us ready for a new round of lockdowns as we
[3:27:48.180 --> 3:27:56.820]  head into the autumn and winter it's all a sick joke and the punchline is you it's all a scam
[3:27:56.820 --> 3:28:02.180]  it's like when the doctors and nurses in new york and other americans it is at the height of the
[3:28:02.180 --> 3:28:08.260]  first covid wave got went outside the hospitals and literally applauded the black lives matter
[3:28:08.260 --> 3:28:13.300]  demonstrators who were congregating in huge numbers because the threat of racism apparently
[3:28:13.300 --> 3:28:19.060]  was more important than the threat posed by covid it's interchangeable infectious disease
[3:28:19.060 --> 3:28:25.220]  experts in sweden are now criticizing the official gay pride parade organization there
[3:28:25.220 --> 3:28:31.540]  because they're having a gay pride parade and on their website there's no mention whatsoever of
[3:28:31.540 --> 3:28:36.980]  monkeypox they say it's not our problem we've got nothing to do with it despite the fact that again
[3:28:36.980 --> 3:28:44.100]  99 percent of monkeypox cases are gay men who have had sex with other gay men but apparently
[3:28:44.100 --> 3:28:48.900]  you know strutting half naked down the street in front of children is more important than
[3:28:48.900 --> 3:28:52.100]  stopping the spread of a virus summit dot news we'll be back in a moment

[3:32:50.180 --> 3:32:56.740]  for joining us i'll spread the word my friends we're involved in epic historic battle leading
[3:32:56.740 --> 3:33:12.660]  a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:33:38.980 --> 3:33:43.140]  now there's a deluge of bad news of course every day but it's important to remember
[3:33:43.140 --> 3:33:49.380]  and to cherish the victories which in terms of this woke agenda we're seeing on an increasingly
[3:33:49.380 --> 3:33:56.820]  regular basis day by day week by week month by month especially in the context of the entertainment
[3:33:56.820 --> 3:34:02.820]  industry which i'm going to get on to later another big budget movie having a massive flop
[3:34:02.820 --> 3:34:09.380]  not even being released because it's so inscrutably dreadful and that is back girl we're going to get
[3:34:09.380 --> 3:34:15.140]  on to that later but similar context in terms of entertainment of course premier league footballers
[3:34:15.140 --> 3:34:23.140]  here in the united kingdom started performing the take a knee stun immediately after the black lives
[3:34:23.140 --> 3:34:29.060]  matter riots in london specifically where they literally attacked police officers and the response
[3:34:29.060 --> 3:34:35.220]  of some of the police officers in london was to take a knee genuflect and bow before them
[3:34:35.220 --> 3:34:40.180]  then we have the sight of premier league footballers multimillionaires performing the same gesture
[3:34:40.180 --> 3:34:46.340]  and then the pundits the political class ridiculously claiming that it had nothing
[3:34:46.340 --> 3:34:52.500]  whatsoever to do with black lives matter despite the fact they did it literally days after police
[3:34:52.500 --> 3:34:58.020]  in london were seen performing the gesture in response to black lives matter riots george
[3:34:58.020 --> 3:35:05.620]  floyd riots well now that narrative is collapsing finally of course we saw it during the euros the
[3:35:05.620 --> 3:35:13.940]  2020-21 euros last year where the england football manager gareth southgate after the england team
[3:35:13.940 --> 3:35:21.460]  reached the final seemingly deliberately picked black football players to take the crucial penalties
[3:35:21.460 --> 3:35:27.380]  against italy in the final of the tournament because he seemingly wanted to have the final word
[3:35:27.380 --> 3:35:33.220]  on this bubbling controversy that colored the tournament which was take a knee unfortunately
[3:35:33.220 --> 3:35:37.540]  for him and england supporters all the black players missed their penalties i guess he should
[3:35:37.540 --> 3:35:42.020]  have just given it to the person best for the job not because of their skin color but now
[3:35:42.020 --> 3:35:47.940]  premier league football is likely to stop taking a knee for blm and in fact this has been confirmed
[3:35:47.940 --> 3:35:52.660]  since i wrote this article that premier league footballers are likely to stop taking a knee
[3:35:52.660 --> 3:35:58.900]  this upcoming season after the gesture lost impact following a number of damaging revelations about
[3:35:58.900 --> 3:36:05.140]  black lives matter no least of course the fact that their entire leadership is basically grifters
[3:36:05.140 --> 3:36:10.260]  who have just cashed in on the movement to buy multi-million dollar luxury homes in the whitest
[3:36:10.260 --> 3:36:17.460]  areas of america that they can find and of course the attendant fallout from all the riots from the
[3:36:17.460 --> 3:36:24.740]  summer of rioting which we won't forget in america which claimed dozens of lives from june 2020 onwards
[3:36:24.740 --> 3:36:31.140]  and of course caused record billions in property damage well now because of course some sections
[3:36:31.140 --> 3:36:37.700]  of supporters have booed take a knee it's lost its impact even if you think its impact is some
[3:36:37.700 --> 3:36:43.060]  limp-wristed anti-racism stance they're abandoning it they're going to do it for the first game
[3:36:43.060 --> 3:36:49.060]  they're going to do it for a few select matches but by and large this performative virtue signaling
[3:36:49.060 --> 3:36:54.100]  gesture before premier league matches which of course command huge audiences across the world
[3:36:54.100 --> 3:37:02.020]  not just in the united kingdom is now dead and done meanwhile though uk police chiefs as authorities
[3:37:02.020 --> 3:37:07.700]  need to stop wasting time investigating people being offended and this brings us to our next video
[3:37:08.340 --> 3:37:15.540]  where a british army veteran in the united kingdom was actually had police show up at his house put
[3:37:15.540 --> 3:37:23.140]  him in handcuffs arrest him because he shared an edgy meme on facebook let's go to this video now
[3:37:23.140 --> 3:37:30.340]  this is the meme police some people still think that it's sort of a joke that police in the uk will
[3:37:30.340 --> 3:37:35.780]  show up if they post something on social media that someone claims to be offended by oh you may
[3:37:35.780 --> 3:37:41.220]  you got a license for that to eat but it's not a joke it happens all the time and it just happened
[3:37:41.220 --> 3:37:47.940]  again 51 year old darren brady was arrested for sharing a meme on facebook deemed offensive to
[3:37:47.940 --> 3:37:54.100]  transgender people he didn't even post the meme himself he shared a post by actor and political
[3:37:54.100 --> 3:37:59.060]  commentator laurence fox the first time police showed up at his house they demanded he attend a
[3:37:59.060 --> 3:38:05.380]  reeducation course to atone for his sins his sin being hurting the thiefies of some hysterical
[3:38:05.380 --> 3:38:11.780]  bedwetting sack of shite and the second time police showed up at his house this happened no just
[3:38:11.780 --> 3:38:23.940]  which culture police would realize how ridiculous this is what did it need to come to because i
[3:38:23.940 --> 3:38:29.380]  don't understand i posted something that he posted you come to arrest me you don't arrest him why is
[3:38:29.380 --> 3:38:34.420]  it come to this why am i in cuffs because there's something he shared then i shared because someone
[3:38:34.420 --> 3:38:41.940]  has been caused obviously anxiety based upon your social media taste that's why you've been arrested
[3:38:41.940 --> 3:38:47.060]  look at this prat if someone has been caused obviously anxiety someone has been caused
[3:38:47.060 --> 3:38:52.580]  anxiety he says it like he's got the moral high ground you're literally arresting someone for
[3:38:52.580 --> 3:38:58.340]  hurting someone's feelings not bad you're literally the thought police not like there are any real
[3:38:58.340 --> 3:39:04.100]  crimes taking place is it not like two in three burglaries aren't even investigated by the police
[3:39:04.100 --> 3:39:09.620]  is it not like car theft has effectively been legalized because only 0.5 percent of cases
[3:39:09.620 --> 3:39:15.460]  lead to charges is it oh but there's plenty of time to investigate playground insults and memes
[3:39:15.460 --> 3:39:20.900]  posted in private whatsapp chat groups brady's arrest was witnessed by harry miller he was
[3:39:20.900 --> 3:39:26.340]  previously interrogated for retweeting a limerick about transgenders but miller won his case the
[3:39:26.340 --> 3:39:31.460]  court of appeal ruled the guidance police were working from breached millers human rights the
[3:39:31.460 --> 3:39:37.940]  uk college of policing then revised the guidance and yet police are still being dispatched to patrol
[3:39:37.940 --> 3:39:45.060]  her feelings why and what does this tell us about the balance of power in our society the lgbt
[3:39:45.060 --> 3:39:50.900]  community is so marginalized that if you make fun of them the cops will literally show up wearing
[3:39:50.900 --> 3:39:57.780]  lgbt lanyards to arrest you for it yes so marginalized likely next prime minister list trust has
[3:39:57.780 --> 3:40:02.740]  promised to put a stop to police wasting their resources on investigating tweets believe it
[3:40:02.740 --> 3:40:07.300]  when i see it the chief constable of greater manchester says police should stop wasting
[3:40:07.300 --> 3:40:12.180]  time investigating tweets just because someone claims to be offended he presides over the most
[3:40:12.180 --> 3:40:18.180]  improved police department in the entire country maybe police in all the shot should listen to him
[3:40:18.180 --> 3:40:28.100]  and concentrate on fighting actual crimes rather than putting people in handcuffs for posting edgy memes
[3:40:28.100 --> 3:40:34.260]  now the point i made in the video was the police have been told by the official police guidance
[3:40:34.260 --> 3:40:40.820]  organization to stop doing this list trust again the probable next prime minister says she's going
[3:40:40.820 --> 3:40:46.740]  to put a stop to it but it keeps happening it was an actual story that a former police officer
[3:40:46.740 --> 3:40:54.740]  was arrested and given 20 weeks in jail because he shared offensive george floyd memes on a private
[3:40:55.300 --> 3:41:02.260]  whatsapp group private it didn't even post it on the internet there are laws in the uk which say
[3:41:02.260 --> 3:41:08.020]  nobody can even release your private communications that is a crime yet they did that they arrested
[3:41:08.020 --> 3:41:14.500]  him they put him in prison for private jokes on his whatsapp text messaging service absolutely
[3:41:14.500 --> 3:41:21.700]  incredible and again you know over 3000 people in the uk arrested every year for tweets this
[3:41:21.700 --> 3:41:27.860]  continues to happen they're not investigating the burglaries no resources for that your car gets
[3:41:27.860 --> 3:41:35.780]  broken into you get robbed there 0.5 of those cases result in charges they don't care about that they
[3:41:35.780 --> 3:41:41.220]  are the thought police and it's still happening in fact i'm going to come back with another video
[3:41:41.220 --> 3:41:47.540]  on that subject after the break meanwhile though daily skeptic reports covid vaccines are killing
[3:41:47.540 --> 3:41:53.060]  one in every 800 over 60s and should be withdrawn immediately says leading vaccine scientist
[3:41:54.020 --> 3:41:58.740]  covid vaccine boost is in older people are killing one person for every 800 doses administered
[3:41:58.740 --> 3:42:03.620]  and should be withdrawn immediately this is dr. Theo Shetters a vaccinologist based in the
[3:42:03.620 --> 3:42:09.300]  Netherlands and again as i mentioned last week with the excess deaths in the united kingdom
[3:42:09.300 --> 3:42:16.420]  you plot the graph of fourth shot covid boosters onto these excess deaths in the Netherlands
[3:42:16.420 --> 3:42:23.860]  and the graph almost matches exactly interesting that isn't it meanwhile of course joe biden is
[3:42:23.860 --> 3:42:30.980]  just being announced again basically i've lost count at this point has tested positive for covid
[3:42:30.980 --> 3:42:37.940]  again so this is basically the third time in the space of the last two weeks that quadruple
[3:42:37.940 --> 3:42:44.740]  vaccinated biden has tested positive for covid again it's a sick joke and you're the punchline
[3:42:44.740 --> 3:42:49.940]  we're going to come back in the next segment now talk about that girl and why it failed this is
[3:42:49.940 --> 3:42:58.180]  summit dot news don't go away info wars has been vindicated we've been proven right world

[3:46:06.500 --> 3:46:13.540]  is don't panic stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship
[3:46:13.540 --> 3:46:21.300]  onto a safe sound course there is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building
[3:46:21.300 --> 3:46:28.340]  our own society all we got to do is survive the crash and right now we still have time to prepare
[3:46:28.340 --> 3:46:35.140]  the world fiat currency system is racing towards zero it's time to convert it into hard assets

[3:46:51.780 --> 3:47:06.260]  today dot com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:47:09.220 --> 3:47:16.260]  live from london england it's hall joseph watson with summit dot news
[3:47:16.260 --> 3:47:25.940]  so the chief constable in manchester england says that the public is sick of the authorities
[3:47:25.940 --> 3:47:32.020]  investigating mean tweets he says there has to be a stop to it we still have it happening of
[3:47:32.020 --> 3:47:37.940]  course as you just saw veterans being harassed handcuffed arrested by police for sharing memes
[3:47:37.940 --> 3:47:45.140]  on facebook well someone else who was at least cause defense in the past few days on twitter was
[3:47:45.140 --> 3:47:52.660]  gary linica which was particularly funny because he's one of the denizens of the woke mob regaid
[3:47:52.660 --> 3:47:59.860]  routinely trying to call other people offensive for their opinions and comments well the backlash
[3:47:59.860 --> 3:48:05.700]  hit him this week and now basically he's being cancelled he's desperately backpedaling because
[3:48:05.700 --> 3:48:12.740]  he made a tweet which dared gently upon on words it wasn't even a joke at the expense of women's
[3:48:12.740 --> 3:48:18.180]  football it was a pun on words but because women's football here in the uk is being shoved down our
[3:48:18.180 --> 3:48:25.060]  throats left right and centre everyone is basically mandated to like it he did a funny pun on words on
[3:48:25.060 --> 3:48:30.660]  twitter and he got absolutely savage for it but again kind of person he is you have to have
[3:48:30.660 --> 3:48:37.380]  zero sympathy for him this is gary linica is cancelled let's roll it well it couldn't have
[3:48:37.380 --> 3:48:42.820]  happened to a more deserving candidate perma woke in beseal gary linica has finally been
[3:48:42.820 --> 3:48:49.700]  cancelled by the same social media mob mindset that he helped create his crime well linica
[3:48:49.700 --> 3:48:55.940]  unintentionally dared to undermine the latest current thing that everyone is supposed to care
[3:48:55.940 --> 3:49:02.020]  about and be deeply supportive of women's football yes our esteemed regime social engineering
[3:49:02.020 --> 3:49:07.540]  overlords demand as much servile genuflecting in honor of female soccer as they did blue and yellow
[3:49:07.540 --> 3:49:13.220]  ukraine flags at the end of february the english women's team winning a trophy by kicking a ball
[3:49:13.220 --> 3:49:18.020]  in a net is being treated by the media as if they'd collectively found a cure for cancer
[3:49:18.020 --> 3:49:23.220]  personally speaking i don't care about women's football and never will the quality is shall
[3:49:23.220 --> 3:49:35.700]  we say not exactly on a par with the men's game so now you know what they're going to make me
[3:49:35.700 --> 3:49:43.540]  watch in the reeducation gulag linica unwittingly fell foul of the mob after he tried to respond
[3:49:43.540 --> 3:49:49.060]  to the england player removing her shirt with a witty quip the lionesses have only gone and done
[3:49:49.060 --> 3:49:56.180]  it the x-football are tweeted kelly is england's heroine brawn on oh no the outrage for this lame
[3:49:56.180 --> 3:50:02.900]  joke linica was treated as if he'd revoked universal female suffrage seriously gary an epic win a game
[3:50:02.900 --> 3:50:06.580]  changer for women's sport a call to arms for young girls who've been told they can't and you minimize
[3:50:06.580 --> 3:50:11.300]  this gory that's a joke about a women's clothing underwear casual sexism is right here and the
[3:50:11.300 --> 3:50:16.900]  lionesses deserve this the backlash was swift and linica quickly deleted the tweet note that he
[3:50:16.900 --> 3:50:22.180]  didn't say anything particularly offensive and merely made the same kind of cringe pun on words
[3:50:22.180 --> 3:50:28.020]  he's done a thousand times before about male footballers but again his egregious transgression
[3:50:28.020 --> 3:50:34.820]  represented such an insult to the mob because it dared to make light of the deadly serious new
[3:50:34.820 --> 3:50:40.260]  current thing that everyone is mandated to be respectful of and reverential towards today it's
[3:50:40.260 --> 3:50:46.100]  women's football next month it'll be something else the lesson is clear don't make fun of the
[3:50:46.100 --> 3:50:54.020]  current thing or the mob will make an example out of you now linica has come out since and
[3:50:54.020 --> 3:50:59.140]  basically said he refuses to apologize you already deleted the tweet you freaked out
[3:50:59.140 --> 3:51:05.460]  wet the bed and deleted the tweet after about five minutes so in a way that's already a pathetic
[3:51:05.460 --> 3:51:12.500]  form of apology let's go to this next video now though because there's a huge wave of anti-woke
[3:51:12.500 --> 3:51:19.060]  basically backlash in the entertainment industry in hollywood and it's developing it's accelerating
[3:51:19.060 --> 3:51:25.140]  over recent months we've had massive success of films like top gun maverick while the ones that
[3:51:25.140 --> 3:51:31.940]  have pushed woke messaging the regime enforced social engineering dogma have consistently
[3:51:31.940 --> 3:51:37.860]  fallen flat on their face and it happened again but it not only happened it happened to a film
[3:51:37.860 --> 3:51:45.060]  that they refused to even release because it was that bad despite the fact that it cost 90 million
[3:51:45.060 --> 3:51:52.500]  dollars to make this is the truth about batgirl here it is they're calling it the most expensive
[3:51:52.500 --> 3:51:59.540]  movie to never actually be released warner brothers spent more than 90 million dollars on batgirl and
[3:51:59.540 --> 3:52:05.220]  yet it's never going to see the light of day not even on their hbo streaming service the official
[3:52:05.220 --> 3:52:10.260]  line is that by cutting its losses now warner brothers will save money on promoting the film
[3:52:10.260 --> 3:52:15.380]  and can also recoup money by filing it as a tax expense true enough but that doesn't explain why
[3:52:15.380 --> 3:52:21.700]  the movie was so dreadful in the first place with test audiences reacting to the film like someone
[3:52:21.700 --> 3:52:27.220]  had let off in the cinema we don't have to dig too deeply to find out why people are sick to the
[3:52:27.220 --> 3:52:33.380]  back teeth of being browbeaten with the message and this crap had it in abundance it was yet
[3:52:33.380 --> 3:52:39.700]  another trojan horse for intersectional woke gobbledygook a star of the film was some no-mark
[3:52:39.700 --> 3:52:44.820]  diversity hire a little known afro latina singer-actress whose only previous film had been an abject
[3:52:44.820 --> 3:52:49.700]  failure the screenplay was written by christina hodson an ultra feminist previously panned for
[3:52:49.700 --> 3:52:55.940]  producing men hating guff batgirl's best mate was a transgender character played by a transgender
[3:52:55.940 --> 3:53:01.940]  actress another reasonable diversity box ticking exercise batgirl was directed by adil l rb and
[3:53:01.940 --> 3:53:07.940]  bill alfala they were also behind the tv series miss marvel an excruciatingly sanctimonious
[3:53:07.940 --> 3:53:13.220]  right on snorefest about a muslim pakistani american teenage girl who is bullied at school
[3:53:13.220 --> 3:53:18.260]  until she developed superpowers miss marvel was panned by comic book fans as an insult to the
[3:53:18.260 --> 3:53:24.100]  genre which is shamelessly exploited to amplify woke social engineering dogmas and the exact same
[3:53:24.100 --> 3:53:28.740]  thing happened again with batgirl you'd have thought that the directors or the people paying
[3:53:28.740 --> 3:53:34.340]  them to make the movies would have seen that as a wake-up call evidently not but this represents
[3:53:34.340 --> 3:53:39.700]  yet another massive white pill get woke go broke used to be somewhat of a boomer cliche but at
[3:53:39.700 --> 3:53:45.380]  least in terms of the entertainment industry it's more true than ever before marvel's mega
[3:53:45.380 --> 3:53:50.100]  budget movie eternals was pandas overly preachy and it crashed and burned buzz light year which
[3:53:50.100 --> 3:53:55.060]  piggybacked off woke messaging was a colossal failure top gun in comparison a movie that refused
[3:53:55.060 --> 3:54:01.780]  to panda to identitarian drivel was a global smash here disney is hemorrhaging subscribers and going
[3:54:01.780 --> 3:54:07.300]  boss netflix is having to jettison woke content to stay afloat while networks like paramount plus
[3:54:07.300 --> 3:54:13.620]  are prioritizing quality over political correctness and they're doing just fine so we know why batgirl
[3:54:13.620 --> 3:54:19.300]  failed it deserved to fail because just like a plethora of previous flops its creators were
[3:54:19.300 --> 3:54:27.700]  more interested in lecturing the audience than keeping them entertained let's hit a final few
[3:54:27.700 --> 3:54:33.460]  news stories here in the last three minutes of the show swedish military says supporting
[3:54:33.460 --> 3:54:39.620]  gay pride parades just as important as defending country yes even though they're apparently faced
[3:54:39.620 --> 3:54:45.380]  with the menace that is russia they're faced with hordes of unintegrated migrants that have
[3:54:45.380 --> 3:54:51.460]  basically created low level civil war in sweden it's now the most dangerous country in europe in
[3:54:51.460 --> 3:54:57.380]  terms of gun crime having been the safest 20 years ago before they let millions of people in from
[3:54:57.380 --> 3:55:02.340]  north africa and the middle east while now the swedish military is asserted that supporting
[3:55:02.340 --> 3:55:07.060]  gay pride parades is just as important as defending the country from foreign attack
[3:55:07.940 --> 3:55:12.740]  they launched a campaign proclaiming gay pride festivals to be more important than ever
[3:55:12.740 --> 3:55:18.500]  and one of the core values of the military in uncertain times wait a minute isn't the military
[3:55:18.500 --> 3:55:24.660]  supposed to be non-political people get court-martialed they get kicked out of the military if they're
[3:55:24.660 --> 3:55:30.740]  found to express political sentiment bias in one way or another that's the same standard across
[3:55:30.740 --> 3:55:37.140]  the western world yet you're expressing not only support but saying it's equally as important as
[3:55:37.140 --> 3:55:44.340]  defending the country from terrorists and foreign adversaries marching in gay pride parades how is
[3:55:44.340 --> 3:55:50.580]  that not political and again how is it not yet another illustration of how the lgbt movement
[3:55:50.580 --> 3:55:55.620]  while it still claims to be marginalized and oppressed is backed by every major corporation
[3:55:55.620 --> 3:56:04.020]  cultural institution government and indeed armed forces in the west absolutely incredible
[3:56:04.020 --> 3:56:10.500]  all also in sweden which has bigger problems than the military supporting gay pride parades
[3:56:11.220 --> 3:56:16.820]  actually some good news here swedish migration minister wants to limit non-nordic population
[3:56:16.820 --> 3:56:23.860]  in troubled areas of course this was a proposal first mooted and indeed now being implemented by
[3:56:23.860 --> 3:56:29.540]  neighboring country denmark where they're actually demolishing entire areas of migrant
[3:56:29.540 --> 3:56:35.700]  ghettos and forcing those migrants to move out because they've created parallel societies that
[3:56:35.700 --> 3:56:42.980]  breed crime and social dislocation the much-vaunted no-goes no-goes own areas that the mainstream
[3:56:42.980 --> 3:56:49.060]  media once claimed were a conspiracy theory of course now you have routine violence in sweden
[3:56:49.060 --> 3:56:55.220]  routine migrant riots in sweden and in other european countries while now their migration
[3:56:55.220 --> 3:56:59.940]  minister anders jegerman has suggested that sweden should follow the example of denmark
[3:57:00.580 --> 3:57:07.860]  denmark says that at least 30 percent of communities or only 30 percent of communities in fact
[3:57:07.860 --> 3:57:14.020]  can be non-western the clear majority 70 percent need to be westerners living in each of those
[3:57:14.020 --> 3:57:20.260]  individual communities while sweden has suggested they're going to implement that to a lesser extent
[3:57:20.260 --> 3:57:25.300]  they're saying a minimum of 50 percent of residents of any area would have to be swedish or from
[3:57:25.300 --> 3:57:31.540]  denmark island finland or norway this of course is after the swedish prime minister a left-wing
[3:57:31.540 --> 3:57:37.860]  feminist came out and said that mass migration had utterly failed so a lot of good news across
