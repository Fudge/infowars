[00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.861]  It's Sunday, October 9th, 2022.
[00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:09.083]  I come to you with grave information.
[00:00:09.883 --> 00:00:26.111]  But not to scare you, I come to you with information so you can get ready and prepare yourself and your family and also expose the globalists who are the main authors of every single major crisis and the perfect storm of tyranny we are all facing here together.
[00:00:27.252 --> 00:00:32.986]   I'll be here For the next two hours live, the intrepid Owen Schroyer from 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:00:33.026 --> 00:00:38.650]  Central with Sunday Live will follow me with guest critical news analysis and of course your amazing phone calls.
[00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:57.880]  I talked to a lot of people Friday, Saturday and then today in different levels of government and corporations and I called them to ask them what intel they had on the economy and they all gave me similar answers.
[00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:03.929]  And I do have some big breaking news that I'm going to be laying out here today.
[00:01:03.908 --> 00:01:07.307]  but here's just one of the pieces.
[00:01:07.307 --> 00:01:13.868]  Well I'm gonna get to it later.
[00:01:12.317 --> 00:01:13.458]  This is pretty delicate stuff.
[00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:19.324]  And I don't want to announce these major layoffs that are about to happen across the U.S.
[00:01:19.344 --> 00:01:22.006]  in the next two weeks to scare people.
[00:01:22.487 --> 00:01:24.729]  But I am doing it so you know that our sources are real.
[00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:33.396]  Massive layoffs at some of the biggest corporations here in the United States.
[00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:36.798]  There's also been gigantic layoffs.
[00:01:37.418 --> 00:01:44.344]  We're talking 10 to 15% of workforces at all the major tech companies, and they've got such control that it's not hit the noose.
[00:01:46.885 --> 00:01:49.347]  And so I was about to go ahead and list these companies, but I think.
[00:01:50.988 --> 00:01:52.029]  I think I should print out.
[00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.933]  Their stock charts and the company names and owners before I.
[00:01:58.047 --> 00:02:00.129]  Actually do that, so maybe I'll do that in the second hour.
[00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.093]  Because the news is so big and it just ties into everything we're talking about.
[00:02:06.574 --> 00:02:07.995]  So that's that's coming up.
[00:02:09.816 --> 00:02:10.837]  And again.
[00:02:12.338 --> 00:02:21.165]  The reason we're covering all this is it's important to understand that this is a designed economic implosion that's being done on purpose and they could flick a switch.
[00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:23.267]  And stop this right now.
[00:02:24.312 --> 00:02:25.673]  But they're doing it all by design.
[00:02:25.713 --> 00:02:27.013]  They've devalued the currencies.
[00:02:27.574 --> 00:02:30.815]  They've given themselves trillions in currency to buy up real infrastructure.
[00:02:31.796 --> 00:02:34.017]  They've doubled and tripled their profits the last three years.
[00:02:34.057 --> 00:02:35.257]  The Fortune 100.
[00:02:35.337 --> 00:02:41.180]  And they've been waging war against all the other companies and businesses and individuals on the planet.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.821]  And you've seen that.
[00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:47.283]  And it's so frustrating now to know they're about to bring down the world economy.
[00:02:48.747 --> 00:02:58.494]  And then roll out their new Build Back Better, Great Reset, Universal Credit Score, Universal Basic Income system.
[00:03:00.155 --> 00:03:06.920]  And so I expose this ahead of time so you can get ready, but also so you know who did it, as if you need me to tell you who did it.
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.481]  America is really waking up fast.
[00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:10.522]  So is the rest of the world.
[00:03:11.102 --> 00:03:17.767]  That's why they're moving in the election fraud systemically to block the people being able to wrest control of the wheel from these madmen.
[00:03:18.334 --> 00:03:18.994]  So we've got that.
[00:03:19.955 --> 00:03:21.035]  And I'll get to that next hour.
[00:03:22.896 --> 00:03:32.120]  Because even though it's important to break this stuff, it feels dirty to let people know what's about to happen to their companies, even though I'm not these companies, even though I'm not the one doing it.
[00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:35.562]  But a man's got to do what a man's got to do.
[00:03:36.502 --> 00:03:37.703]  And I will do what I got to do.
[00:03:38.823 --> 00:03:40.004]  But it's it's big.
[00:03:40.984 --> 00:03:41.544]  And it's bad.
[00:03:42.725 --> 00:03:45.286]  Now, the layoffs start in two weeks.
[00:03:46.784 --> 00:03:49.686]  And they're going to get really bad right after the midterms.
[00:03:49.726 --> 00:03:58.571]  So as a Christmas present in late November to kill the Christmas shopping season, they're going to have just a bloodbath in the stock market.
[00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:02.133]  That's what currently is the plan.
[00:04:02.294 --> 00:04:12.920]  A bloodbath in the jobs market, a bloodbath in the energy market, and a physical accelerating bloodbath in Ukraine and other areas of the world.
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.401]  So let's just stop there.
[00:04:17.816 --> 00:04:18.616]  And we're all in this together.
[00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:19.277]  This is going to be bad.
[00:04:19.737 --> 00:04:20.578]  But at least we know.
[00:04:20.598 --> 00:04:21.238]  At least we're ready.
[00:04:21.778 --> 00:04:22.679]  Or at least partially ready.
[00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:30.603]  And then I'm going to hit the massive news on the social credit score when we come back, and PayPal, and just so much more.
[00:04:30.983 --> 00:04:31.383]  Stay with us.
[00:04:34.245 --> 00:04:42.469]  All right, I'm going to try as best I can to be calm and judicious tonight so that I can get to all this information in the next two hours.
[00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.451]  Thanks for joining us on this Sunday live broadcast.
[00:04:45.471 --> 00:04:46.912]  I've been doing this Sunday live broadcast.
[00:04:47.805 --> 00:04:54.550]  Now for 15 years, 4 to 6 p.m., been doing the regular syndicated weekday show, 11 a.m.
[00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.230]  to 3 p.m.
[00:04:56.051 --> 00:05:07.278]  for 24 years, been on air 28 years, and boy, has what all the old-timers told me was coming when I was a little kid, when I was in high school and college.
[00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:10.320]  Everything they told me turned out to be true.
[00:05:11.401 --> 00:05:19.127]   Everything my grandfathers told me, everything my father told me, everything my father's uncle told me, Everything my uncle told me.
[00:05:20.268 --> 00:05:23.671]  Everything that Barry Goldwater said.
[00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:25.032]  Everything that Ron Paul said.
[00:05:25.752 --> 00:05:27.794]  Everything that Joseph McCarthy said.
[00:05:27.854 --> 00:05:31.557]  Everything that Robert Welch said.
[00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.279]  Everything that J. Edward Griffin said.
[00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:35.600]  Everything that Ted Gunderson said.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.643]  Everything that Aaron Russo said.
[00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:43.966]  Everything that Charlotte Iserby said.
[00:05:46.431 --> 00:05:51.054]  Everything that Phyllis Schlafly said, everything they said came true.
[00:05:53.935 --> 00:05:54.676]  Up until this point.
[00:05:55.756 --> 00:05:58.318]  They even got it down to the time frame and what years it would happen.
[00:05:59.038 --> 00:05:59.638]  You know why?
[00:05:59.698 --> 00:06:06.722]  Because they had worked at the highest levels of corporations and government and they had people try to bring them into it to be part of it.
[00:06:07.923 --> 00:06:10.985]  Including some people in my family who were patriots and said no.
[00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:24.000]  And they took the big powerful high-paying jobs they had and they went back to being farmers and auto mechanics and running convenience stores rather than be part of the evil.
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.461]  And they had their souls and have their souls.
[00:06:29.303 --> 00:06:36.700]   When I learned about this as a child and then learned it was true as I grew up and saw it happening in the world, It was very adventurous.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.581]  It was exciting to be battling the New World Order.
[00:06:38.821 --> 00:06:40.602]  You could see them trying to launch their programs.
[00:06:40.622 --> 00:06:43.483]  You could see the embryonic levels of what they built.
[00:06:43.523 --> 00:06:47.925]  But now we're facing the full-grown New World Order.
[00:06:48.725 --> 00:06:51.366]  It's not in beta anymore.
[00:06:51.486 --> 00:06:56.328]  It's in full-blown attack mode.
[00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:00.170]  So we're not going to have to wait around for it anymore.
[00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.711]  Everybody's going to have to either find God or find the devil.
[00:07:05.086 --> 00:07:07.427]  Because you're going to find one or the other, because that's what's going on here.
[00:07:07.447 --> 00:07:09.827]  You're going to run to one or the other.
[00:07:10.468 --> 00:07:12.088]  If I was you, I wouldn't be running to the devil.
[00:07:12.648 --> 00:07:15.729]  The great betrayer, the great deceiver, the great fraud.
[00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.930]  All right, let me tell you what's coming up today.
[00:07:20.751 --> 00:07:24.412]  I made a lot of phone calls Friday, Saturday, and this morning, this afternoon.
[00:07:24.432 --> 00:07:25.952]  A lot of my sources.
[00:07:26.293 --> 00:07:31.334]  And I can do my own research, and most of the time just go off my own assessment, but I wanted to bounce some stuff off of them.
[00:07:31.934 --> 00:07:34.035]  I wanted to know the true state of the economy, and they told me.
[00:07:35.666 --> 00:07:43.371]  At the governmental level, at the corporate level, at the big tech level.
[00:07:44.232 --> 00:07:46.093]  And it's what I'd already basically seen.
[00:07:46.654 --> 00:07:47.674]  You don't need me to tell you that.
[00:07:47.894 --> 00:07:48.595]  You can see it too.
[00:07:48.655 --> 00:07:51.437]  But they've been suppressing the real amount of layoffs.
[00:07:51.477 --> 00:07:53.418]  They've been suppressing what's really about to happen to the economy.
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.420]  And it's all been done by design.
[00:07:57.221 --> 00:08:03.025]  I played a member of the Trilateral Commission of the CFR on Friday at the Cato Institute bragging that they were taking away jobs.
[00:08:04.594 --> 00:08:06.175]  To bring white men to their knees.
[00:08:06.275 --> 00:08:08.657]  As if that brings white men to their knees.
[00:08:08.717 --> 00:08:10.578]  It brings us all to our knees.
[00:08:10.618 --> 00:08:14.021]  Except the few thousand, mainly white men, that are running this.
[00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:14.701]  Truly sick.
[00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:16.923]  That's coming up next hour.
[00:08:17.023 --> 00:08:18.003]  Obama Advisor.
[00:08:18.063 --> 00:08:20.605]  We're not in a controlled place on inflation.
[00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:23.267]  Americans must begin managing for some slowdown.
[00:08:23.307 --> 00:08:27.210]  That's Larry Summers that helped engineer all of that.
[00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:28.771]  We'll be getting into this whole stack.
[00:08:30.532 --> 00:08:32.994]  And our energy system being shut off and much more.
[00:08:36.451 --> 00:08:37.111]  In the second hour.
[00:08:37.151 --> 00:08:38.972]  But let me tell you what's coming up now.
[00:08:38.992 --> 00:08:45.794]  Because the backdrop of that terrible news and the terrible military news and the war news is some really good news.
[00:08:47.675 --> 00:08:54.457]  I've got three stacks that I want to cover with the good news.
[00:08:55.798 --> 00:08:57.318]  And they're all really splendid.
[00:08:57.798 --> 00:08:59.939]  And it shows the people are waking up and taking action.
[00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:04.320]  And it shows Newtonian physics is again being proven accurate for every action.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.521]  There's an opposite and equal reaction.
[00:09:06.323 --> 00:09:07.323]  We're opposite and equal reduction.
[00:09:08.724 --> 00:09:10.505]  So let me start getting into the good news first.
[00:09:12.806 --> 00:09:22.631]  PayPal came out on Friday in their terms of service officially and said, if we don't like what you say or what you believe, we will fine you $2,500 per infraction.
[00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:28.393]  It was a gigantic backlash and they revoked it and said, we're sorry, we're not going to do it.
[00:09:28.654 --> 00:09:29.234]  You mean for now?
[00:09:29.853 --> 00:09:32.915]  They've gotten away with so much for so long, I told you next is debanking.
[00:09:33.415 --> 00:09:37.959]  Next is the universal basic income, and the social credit score, and total control.
[00:09:38.359 --> 00:09:41.661]  When they snap their fingers and say jump, you say, yes sir, master, how high?
[00:09:44.743 --> 00:09:45.904]  Well now they've had to back off.
[00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:49.686]  Finally, because there was such a huge backlash, we're going to be hitting that.
[00:09:50.967 --> 00:10:08.716]   But even bigger than that, because once we find our soul, once we find our will, once we find our spine, once we find our huevos, Once we find our ovaries, if you're a woman, once you find your brain, once you find your will, your survival instinct, this will all turn around real fast.
[00:10:09.757 --> 00:10:11.398]  But not if it goes much further.
[00:10:11.418 --> 00:10:13.159]  That's why I'm like the edge of a cliff here.
[00:10:13.499 --> 00:10:15.781]  We're all being pushed over and I'm like, folks, we can turn around.
[00:10:16.101 --> 00:10:16.942]  We don't have to do this.
[00:10:17.442 --> 00:10:20.424]  And they're behind us trying to scare us to run off the edge of a cliff.
[00:10:20.504 --> 00:10:22.886]  All we gotta do is say no and come back for air.
[00:10:24.628 --> 00:10:29.871]  It's like they've hypnotized us and we're at the bottom of a pool 10 feet under and they've hypnotized us and we think we can't swim to the surface.
[00:10:29.891 --> 00:10:31.612]  Well, when we pass out, we're going to drown.
[00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:37.895]  We got time to swim back to the surface, but we just got to decide to come out of the trance and go, Hey, this is a bad idea.
[00:10:38.255 --> 00:10:40.056]  I'm going to swim 10 feet to the surface.
[00:10:40.416 --> 00:10:42.137]  Just, it's so easy, but you got to do it.
[00:10:43.337 --> 00:10:46.319]  It's that easy, but you got to decide these people are out to get you.
[00:10:46.339 --> 00:10:47.540]  People are like, well, that's scary.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.241]  We have predators and really evil people in command.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:11:01.083]  That's why in basic criminology, if you study it, it's very interesting, most victims of crime couldn't believe it was happening to them and didn't fight back or didn't even run and complied.
[00:11:01.783 --> 00:11:04.063]  And corporations teach people, comply with crime.
[00:11:04.924 --> 00:11:05.884]  Comply with robbers.
[00:11:06.764 --> 00:11:08.785]  And of course, that just makes it worse and worse and worse.
[00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:13.026]  When you don't comply with criminals, they're a scarce commodity and they live in fear.
[00:11:13.566 --> 00:11:16.267]  When we comply, we die.
[00:11:17.407 --> 00:11:20.508]  Again, Zapata, great Mexican revolutionary, love his writings.
[00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:24.049]  But he said, it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees.
[00:11:25.589 --> 00:11:26.169]  And he's right.
[00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.430]  But it's better to live on your feet than die on your knees.
[00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:32.731]  Because you live on your feet, you die on your knees.
[00:11:33.011 --> 00:11:33.951]  That's an Alex Jones quote.
[00:11:34.572 --> 00:11:35.932]  You don't live on your knees.
[00:11:37.052 --> 00:11:38.013]  You live on your feet.
[00:11:38.193 --> 00:11:39.173]  At least your children do.
[00:11:39.433 --> 00:11:40.673]  And that's what men are supposed to do.
[00:11:40.693 --> 00:11:44.674]  So when we come back, whoo, just got chills.
[00:11:44.834 --> 00:11:47.135]  You want to talk about living on your feet.
[00:11:48.894 --> 00:11:51.416]  I'm not doing a popularity contest with Trump and DeSantis.
[00:11:51.797 --> 00:11:52.337]  I love Trump.
[00:11:52.397 --> 00:11:53.098]  I know he's for real.
[00:11:53.318 --> 00:11:54.659]  The enemy absolutely hates his guts.
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:02.767]  He did so many great things that in the balance are incredible, but you add the vaccine poison to it, it outweighs it all.
[00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.790]  I still love the fact he's getting good Republicans elected.
[00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.371]  Love the fact he's battling the globalists.
[00:12:07.411 --> 00:12:07.792]  It's great.
[00:12:10.552 --> 00:12:14.095]  It's like, you know, you love your dad, but you wish he didn't rob banks.
[00:12:14.375 --> 00:12:19.239]  Or, you know, you love your cousin, but you wish, you know, that he wasn't an arsonist.
[00:12:19.459 --> 00:12:20.240]  He just can't help it.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.681]  He burns stuff down sometimes.
[00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:23.382]  It kind of outweighs it.
[00:12:23.422 --> 00:12:23.862]  You know what I mean?
[00:12:24.683 --> 00:12:27.925]  Well, I love my cousin, yeah, but he likes to burn barns down.
[00:12:28.166 --> 00:12:29.387]  That's just a hypothetical example.
[00:12:30.307 --> 00:12:37.167]   I think I did have a distant cousin that did like to do that, but the point is, is that He just loved to watch stuff burn down.
[00:12:37.487 --> 00:12:38.228]  He's a great guy.
[00:12:38.268 --> 00:12:40.569]  Boy, he's fun at a bar, but he likes to burn stuff.
[00:12:41.109 --> 00:12:46.253]  So, I'm not likening Trump to that, but it's similar to that.
[00:12:47.313 --> 00:12:54.117]  We have the biggest, and I keep saying this every day because it's true, but this is like way bigger than anything else that's happened so far in the COVID news.
[00:12:54.818 --> 00:12:56.539]  And we're going to hit it with DeSantis on the other side.
[00:12:56.899 --> 00:12:58.380]  DeSantis has come directly out.
[00:13:01.294 --> 00:13:04.655]  I mean, DeSantis got me a month ago and he said, don't give it to children, it hurts them, here's the study.
[00:13:05.056 --> 00:13:08.617]  Which we already knew, but he used his power, his bully pulpit, to expose it.
[00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:15.840]  Now he's come out with his Surgeon General, who's a great doctor, and just destroyed the whole lie.
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:23.583]  And when I saw this yesterday, this is broke on Friday and it's getting suppressed everywhere, I just jumped for joy.
[00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.992]  I got tears in my eyes and just knew my gut was right about DeSantis.
[00:13:28.473 --> 00:13:38.098]  Because believe me, you don't do stuff like this unless you have got understanding of what's happening and you know how dangerous it is and you've got a will to take on evil.
[00:13:38.159 --> 00:13:39.559]  I mean, I'm getting tears in my eyes right now.
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.341]  I mean, this is total... You want Bonifidi?
[00:13:43.502 --> 00:13:44.262]  Proof in the pudding?
[00:13:45.883 --> 00:13:47.264]  You want to know DeSantis is for real?
[00:13:47.504 --> 00:13:48.145]  Baby, this is it.
[00:13:51.553 --> 00:13:59.338]  And so, Florida Surgeon General COVID mRNA vaccine causes an 84% increase in death.
[00:14:01.499 --> 00:14:07.423]  Yeah, that is royal flush, grand slam, Super Bowl victory.
[00:14:07.823 --> 00:14:08.403]  Whoo!
[00:14:09.284 --> 00:14:11.605]  Man, I mean, this is good.
[00:14:11.625 --> 00:14:17.809]  Stay with us.
[00:14:17.668 --> 00:14:20.668]  Imagine how hard the heart is of Bill Gates.
[00:14:20.668 --> 00:14:24.668]  People like Klaus Schwab.
[00:14:24.668 --> 00:14:27.668]  They think there's too many of us and they're greedy.
[00:14:27.998 --> 00:14:28.899]  They want to kill people.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.381]  They want total power over civilization.
[00:14:34.282 --> 00:14:35.563]  And so they release a virus.
[00:14:38.045 --> 00:14:43.308]  And they establish world government, not just over medicine, but censorship and borders and world IDs.
[00:14:44.529 --> 00:14:56.359]   And then they give you a shot that erases your immune system and statistically is way worse the actual COVID and gives you What the COVID actually causes, the spike protein.
[00:14:58.219 --> 00:15:02.161]  Think about how insanely wicked and evil that is.
[00:15:03.481 --> 00:15:13.404]  So, Florida Surgeon General COVID mRNA vaccine causes 84% increase in death for men ages 18 to 39.
[00:15:13.804 --> 00:15:18.086]  Now we've seen that out of insurance company actuaries, similar numbers.
[00:15:18.666 --> 00:15:22.347]  We've seen it come out in other government reports in Germany and in the UK.
[00:15:24.252 --> 00:15:26.594]  And he put out a press release and he had a press conference.
[00:15:30.056 --> 00:15:30.656]  On Friday.
[00:15:32.017 --> 00:15:36.920]  We talked about those findings and talked about the other statistics for other demographics.
[00:15:38.401 --> 00:15:39.062]  And age groups.
[00:15:41.764 --> 00:15:46.607]  And other than a few places like Fox News, almost no news coverage of it.
[00:15:47.167 --> 00:15:49.309]  So let that sink in your.
[00:15:50.294 --> 00:16:03.429]  Many times more likely, depending on the study, but they're all 40 to 80 percent, depending on the shot you take, Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, J&J, likely to get sick, likely to catch it, likely to get sick, likely to go to the hospital, likely to die.
[00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:10.417]  That's a long way from two years ago, where they said it had 96 percent efficacy.
[00:16:12.782 --> 00:16:14.643]  By the way, real vaccines may have side effects.
[00:16:14.663 --> 00:16:15.223]  A lot of them do.
[00:16:15.243 --> 00:16:16.203]  They may add things to them.
[00:16:16.543 --> 00:16:17.184]  Trojan horses.
[00:16:17.224 --> 00:16:20.985]  But a real vaccine is 99.9% effective for at least a decade.
[00:16:21.245 --> 00:16:22.105]  These aren't vaccines.
[00:16:22.345 --> 00:16:23.206]  These are gene therapies.
[00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:30.608]  So let's actually go over part of his press release that is so incredibly historic.
[00:16:30.668 --> 00:16:31.888]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:38.251]  That's Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo.
[00:16:38.311 --> 00:16:39.071]  I pronounced that right.
[00:16:40.651 --> 00:16:41.792]  Florida Surgeon General.
[00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:43.745]  You know what's happening to me, folks?
[00:16:43.765 --> 00:16:45.306]  I got glasses two years ago.
[00:16:45.906 --> 00:16:47.186]  And they give me a headache when I wear them.
[00:16:48.167 --> 00:16:49.927]  But I gotta start wearing glasses or contacts.
[00:16:50.647 --> 00:16:52.868]  Because I'm like, look at the page.
[00:16:52.928 --> 00:16:53.928]  It's blurring sometimes.
[00:16:53.948 --> 00:16:56.109]  It's where we start getting a little bit of vision loss.
[00:16:56.149 --> 00:16:57.849]  It's like, it's not always the same.
[00:16:57.889 --> 00:16:59.070]  It kind of goes in and out.
[00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.530]  It's crazy.
[00:17:02.423 --> 00:17:09.765]  So, the Surgeon General of Florida, today we release an analysis of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines the public needs to be aware of.
[00:17:10.105 --> 00:17:15.366]  This analysis showed an increased risk of cardiac related deaths among men 18 to 39.
[00:17:16.386 --> 00:17:18.487]  Florida will not be silent on the truth.
[00:17:19.007 --> 00:17:19.227]  Wow!
[00:17:20.047 --> 00:17:22.328]  There's a press release on screen from Florida Health.
[00:17:23.988 --> 00:17:37.116]  Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo on Friday released the state's analysis of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, revealing an 84% increased risk of cardiac-related death among men 18 to 39.
[00:17:37.496 --> 00:17:39.317]  Florida will not be silent on the truth.
[00:17:40.098 --> 00:17:47.462]  The guidance recommends that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines for males 18 to 39 years old not be given.
[00:17:47.582 --> 00:17:55.202]   In a statement, The doctor said that the studying of the safety, the efficacy of any medication including vaccines, is an important component of public health.
[00:17:55.602 --> 00:18:01.244]  Far less attention has been paid to safety and the concerns of many individuals who've had been dismissed.
[00:18:01.564 --> 00:18:04.865]  These are important findings that should be communicated to Floridians.
[00:18:05.926 --> 00:18:06.966]  Well that's to say the least.
[00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:22.760]  The Florida Department of Health released the findings of a self-controlled, their own study, case series, which they used to evaluate the safety of COVID vaccines, which studied mortality risk following mRNA COVID-19 vaccinations.
[00:18:23.321 --> 00:18:31.086]  So the state itself signed up a bunch of people, didn't tell them what the study was, had them take the shot, because they were wanting it, to see what would happen.
[00:18:31.827 --> 00:18:37.951]  That's what he's been doing in the last year since Governor DeSantis brought him in and said he's given full faith in him.
[00:18:39.895 --> 00:18:43.657]  But they went on, they looked at other major studies that are out that found similar numbers.
[00:18:43.677 --> 00:18:54.623]  So it's not just the state of Florida study, it's a bunch of others, including Oxford, New England Medical Journal, the list goes on and on.
[00:18:55.824 --> 00:19:06.355]   The Florida Department of Health released the findings of a self-controlled case series Which they used to evaluate the safety of COVID vaccines, which studied mortality risk of mRNA COVID-19 vaccinations.
[00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:17.747]  It found that there is an 84% increase in the relative incidence of cardiac-related death among males 80-39 years old within 28 days following mRNA vaccination.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:32.348]  The findings also showed that males over the age of 60 had a 10% increased risk of cardiac-related death within 28 days of mRNA vaccination, and that non-mRNA vaccines were not found to have these increased risks among any population.
[00:19:33.489 --> 00:19:34.409]  Oh, isn't that interesting?
[00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.091]  Because they're not vaccines.
[00:19:38.592 --> 00:19:50.076]   The analysis comes after the Florida Department of Health issued guidance in March that recommended against the use of COVID mRNA vaccine for healthy children and adolescents five years old to 17
[00:19:50.076 --> 00:19:55.694]   years old. The state also recommends against COVID-19 vaccinations amongst infants and children
[00:19:55.694 --> 00:20:00.684]   under five years old which has since been issued under emergency use authorization. When the guidance
[00:20:00.684 --> 00:20:05.394]   for children was issued, the Biden administration accused the Surgeon General of
[00:20:05.394 --> 00:20:07.625]  Florida of being a politician.
[00:20:07.625 --> 00:20:14.316]  It goes on from there. Let's not just go off what Joseph A.
[00:20:14.316 --> 00:20:18.985]   Latipo said. Let's go off all the other studies and all the other information.
[00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:20.078]  You've seen it out there.
[00:20:20.119 --> 00:20:27.221]  You know that what he's saying has been found by countless other research institutes, hospitals, universities, you name it.
[00:20:28.102 --> 00:20:29.642]  So what's the big issue here?
[00:20:30.543 --> 00:20:33.784]  This is known by anybody that wants to know this.
[00:20:33.904 --> 00:20:42.207]  And this is why I said months ago, Trump better, now that the evidence is overwhelming, come out against this or he becomes an active participant in it.
[00:20:42.227 --> 00:20:50.157]   Now remember, in October of 2020, The CDC put out a document on its website that we've shown probably a thousand times.
[00:20:50.177 --> 00:20:52.079]  We'll show it again right now for TV viewers.
[00:20:52.139 --> 00:20:53.820]  Radio listeners, I'll read the headlines.
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.380]  You can find it.
[00:20:54.781 --> 00:20:56.402]  It's on the CDC website right now.
[00:20:57.482 --> 00:21:01.185]  It said, this is what we believe the adverse reactions will be.
[00:21:01.726 --> 00:21:07.710]  Myocarditis, heart attacks, blood clots, strokes, infertility, and like 30 other plus things.
[00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:11.773]  We've shown it over a thousand times.
[00:21:12.978 --> 00:21:15.741]  We were the first to break it over two years ago.
[00:21:16.562 --> 00:21:18.243]  And we've hammered it and hammered it and hammered it.
[00:21:18.524 --> 00:21:23.008]  And we've been censored over and over again, having medical doctors on trying to expose it.
[00:21:23.989 --> 00:21:35.681]  And that leads us to the criminal activity of big tech and big pharma and the media trying to continually cover this information up when it comes out from credible sources.
[00:21:35.901 --> 00:21:38.933]   In fact, It just happened to the Surgeon General of Florida.
[00:21:39.133 --> 00:21:44.476]  Twitter removes, then reinstates Florida Surgeon General's COVID vaccine warning tweet.
[00:21:47.318 --> 00:21:55.043]  He put out a document, officially said of Florida, they blocked it, but then backed off because they know the world's waking up and turning against them.
[00:21:55.243 --> 00:21:56.704]  And who else is waking up and turning against them?
[00:21:57.084 --> 00:21:59.846]  This is a big article up on InfoWars.com and Banned.Video.
[00:22:00.603 --> 00:22:05.091]  Funeral directors and embalmers unite to expose a day in the death of a life.
[00:22:05.471 --> 00:22:12.764]  And now they're seeing double and triple the number of people dead from blood clots and heart attacks, and they've never seen anything like it in their arteries and veins.
[00:22:13.104 --> 00:22:14.427]  Same thing all the scientists are finding.
[00:22:16.169 --> 00:22:19.131]  We've got also more and more scientists coming out against fluoride in the water.
[00:22:19.452 --> 00:22:24.236]  That's coming up, but I wanted to hit that first because that's really good news.
[00:22:24.716 --> 00:22:26.497]  And I'm not making Trump the villain.
[00:22:26.718 --> 00:22:27.598]  There it is on screen.
[00:22:28.179 --> 00:22:30.100]  I'm just saying he's being set up with this.
[00:22:30.381 --> 00:22:31.121]  He should get ahead of it.
[00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:31.962]  There's not much time.
[00:22:32.162 --> 00:22:32.843]  Maybe it's too late.
[00:22:33.723 --> 00:22:40.529]  FDA safety surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines draft working list of possible adverse events.
[00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.072]  That was put out months before they began the injections.
[00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:47.823]  In October of 2020, the injection started in January.
[00:22:48.103 --> 00:22:49.024]  We'll be right back.
[00:22:49.064 --> 00:22:49.544]  Stay with us.
[00:22:49.403 --> 00:22:59.403]  Big guest coming up.
[00:22:59.403 --> 00:23:00.864]  (dramatic music)
[00:23:00.972 --> 00:23:01.852]  They better listen good.
[00:23:02.793 --> 00:23:08.797]  We were dead on in January and February of 2020 saying this is a globalist takeover.
[00:23:09.217 --> 00:23:10.138]  Lockdowns are coming.
[00:23:10.558 --> 00:23:11.919]  They're going to roll out a global government.
[00:23:13.047 --> 00:23:14.248]  Are you in biomedical tyranny?
[00:23:14.548 --> 00:23:18.751]  We're going to try to forcibly inject you and it's going to make you sick and it's going to kill a lot of people.
[00:23:19.191 --> 00:23:21.393]  And now it's here exactly as we said.
[00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:31.499]  And you have the Surgeon General of Florida in a major study reporting on an 80 plus percent increase in heart attacks in men who've taken the Moderna or Pfizer shot.
[00:23:31.599 --> 00:23:34.241]  Exactly what we've been telling you for over two years.
[00:23:36.483 --> 00:23:37.323]  Let that sink in.
[00:23:39.265 --> 00:23:39.945]  Think about that.
[00:23:42.046 --> 00:23:42.647]  Long and hard.
[00:23:46.377 --> 00:23:48.137]  Why would the CDC put it in their own document?
[00:23:48.157 --> 00:23:50.478]  Because they want plausible deniability.
[00:23:52.078 --> 00:23:53.519]  They're hiding the whole thing in plain view.
[00:23:55.459 --> 00:23:56.860]  Let me move to our next big victory.
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:06.782]  And yes, it's a sad victory, but 99% of people, I showed you the statistics two weeks ago and again last week, are not taking the new Pfizer and Moderna booster shots.
[00:24:08.663 --> 00:24:16.041]   99 less percent uptake And all over the place, the fake mandates of California and New York and other places are falling.
[00:24:16.381 --> 00:24:18.042]  In Europe, the forced injections are failing.
[00:24:18.302 --> 00:24:24.264]  They tried to intimidate and bum rush and panic and bully everyone into submission, but it didn't work.
[00:24:25.985 --> 00:24:28.766]  Some took it, but the victory we've had now is massive.
[00:24:28.826 --> 00:24:30.267]  People are really waking up.
[00:24:30.307 --> 00:24:32.688]  It's very sad for those that took the poison shots.
[00:24:32.728 --> 00:24:33.968]  There are some mitigating factors.
[00:24:33.988 --> 00:24:38.510]  We've got a lot of scientists and doctors coming on in the next few weeks to talk about how you can try to mitigate.
[00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.111]  If you did take the shot, we're not judging anybody.
[00:24:41.713 --> 00:24:42.873]  Intimidated into doing it.
[00:24:44.354 --> 00:24:46.334]  Bullied and beat over the head into submitting to it.
[00:24:47.154 --> 00:24:53.956]  But this is so massive, and his findings in Florida fit what all the other findings are from the insurance companies, you name it.
[00:24:54.156 --> 00:25:02.578]  Then, on Friday, PayPal changes his terms of service and says, and when this first broke, people thought it was fake news.
[00:25:03.938 --> 00:25:07.419]  When the Daily Wire first looked at the terms of service, it was, this isn't real.
[00:25:08.843 --> 00:25:22.210]  Kind of like two years ago when Facebook changed its terms of service saying there are 12 people, 12 people you're allowed to attack or be violent against or promote violence against Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, Gab McGinnis, Louis Farrakhan and a few others.
[00:25:22.971 --> 00:25:23.731]  People thought it was fake.
[00:25:23.751 --> 00:25:28.494]  Someone went to the Facebook website and actually said you're allowed to call for violence against these people.
[00:25:30.095 --> 00:25:32.316]  They're beta testing to see what you'll put up with.
[00:25:32.336 --> 00:25:35.698]  Remember how Twitter banned Trump a few times and said it was an accident?
[00:25:35.778 --> 00:25:38.179]  It was conditioning you to see what your response would be.
[00:25:40.888 --> 00:26:00.703]   Well, they came out Friday on PayPal and said, if you say anything politically incorrect, if you question global warming, if you question open borders, if you question election fraud, if you question the shots, they said, We will fine you $2,500 if you do it on your own website, your own radio show, your own Facebook account.
[00:26:00.763 --> 00:26:01.283]  We don't care.
[00:26:01.323 --> 00:26:02.644]  If we see it, we'll do it.
[00:26:02.664 --> 00:26:03.544]  And what is that really saying?
[00:26:03.944 --> 00:26:06.925]  We're spying on you, is what they really said.
[00:26:07.385 --> 00:26:16.228]  Not only will we fine you and steal money from you under these rules outside of law, when even if the feds or the state want to fine you, they've got to prove it in court.
[00:26:16.648 --> 00:26:24.494]   They're now, Judge Jury Executioner, they're now The system, and they're going to make you pay dictatorially, but that's only one issue.
[00:26:24.855 --> 00:26:29.836]  The spying, the surveillance on what you're saying, even outside of your finances.
[00:26:30.436 --> 00:26:31.877]  They're letting you know we're watching you.
[00:26:32.137 --> 00:26:33.437]  That's the social credit score.
[00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:35.578]  This is so huge.
[00:26:35.998 --> 00:26:40.740]  And they backed off by Saturday night and said, yeah, we put that out.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.760]  It was a mistake.
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.721]  No, it was a test.
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.981]  And it shows you how deep down this rabbit hole we are.
[00:26:48.262 --> 00:26:51.723]  Four years ago when PayPal banned us, I said, you're next.
[00:26:51.803 --> 00:26:56.705]  I've got the articles we wrote about it saying within five years they'll be doing it to you.
[00:26:59.227 --> 00:26:59.587]  Sorry.
[00:27:00.567 --> 00:27:01.067]  It was early.
[00:27:01.448 --> 00:27:01.948]  I was wrong.
[00:27:02.308 --> 00:27:02.788]  A correction.
[00:27:03.068 --> 00:27:03.609]  A year early.
[00:27:03.869 --> 00:27:05.329]  I have the articles, I have the videos right here.
[00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:09.271]  The good news is people went crazy.
[00:27:09.391 --> 00:27:19.919]   Elon Musk came out against it and said, we need criminal charges against Hey, pal, and I got calls saying, hey, Peter Thiel owns, you know, he helped found it.
[00:27:19.979 --> 00:27:20.939]  He hasn't owned it in years.
[00:27:20.999 --> 00:27:21.960]  Peter Thiel didn't do this.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.001]  That's all coming up.
[00:27:25.101 --> 00:27:28.182]  But I got Robert Barnes from this segment and the next with us.
[00:27:29.562 --> 00:27:35.504]  Great constitutional lawyer, great friend of mine, great patriot, worked on my Sandy Hook show trial case, went to Connecticut with me last week.
[00:27:36.304 --> 00:27:37.265]  Powerful press conferences.
[00:27:37.305 --> 00:27:39.545]  And I got to tell you, Barnes has been popular for years.
[00:27:40.206 --> 00:27:43.867]  But it's just, and I'm not bragging for Barnes, it shows how liberty is becoming popular.
[00:27:45.959 --> 00:28:01.649]  I have had no fewer than at least 20 people at the grocery store, I took my daughter to a pumpkin patch yesterday to pick a pumpkin, at a gas station, at a cryo facility I went to, because I like to do that when I have joint pain, it really works.
[00:28:03.871 --> 00:28:10.415]  At least 20 people the last week have said, we love Robert Barnes and his co-host Viva Frye.
[00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:12.416]  That to me is victory.
[00:28:12.476 --> 00:28:13.537]  That is exciting.
[00:28:14.284 --> 00:28:18.604]   to see that he's reaching millions of people every week now and he joins us to talk about my case
[00:28:18.604 --> 00:28:23.244]   which is your case just like PayPal I told you would be you they have admitted that this
[00:28:23.244 --> 00:28:31.323]   weaponized case and I put out wrong numbers when I thought there were less plaintiffs when I talked
[00:28:31.323 --> 00:28:38.764]   to Pattis on Thursday he said yeah they want 550 million per plaintiff on one count.
[00:28:38.981 --> 00:28:39.621]  There's four counts.
[00:28:40.402 --> 00:28:42.423]  So I went on there and said $7 plus billion.
[00:28:42.443 --> 00:28:43.984]  He called me back and said, no, that's wrong.
[00:28:44.404 --> 00:28:45.965]  There are 15 plaintiffs.
[00:28:46.265 --> 00:28:56.590]  So that's $8.25 billion they officially asked for, for me questioning Sandy Hook and then lying about what Ashley said and then not letting me defend myself.
[00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:02.205]   Then the national media Spun it that I was chicken and didn't testify last week.
[00:29:02.265 --> 00:29:03.766]  The judge said I couldn't defend myself.
[00:29:04.066 --> 00:29:05.026]  So why be a puppet?
[00:29:05.586 --> 00:29:07.047]  So to talk about this is Robert Barnes.
[00:29:07.067 --> 00:29:10.608]  We'll come back and play the clip of Kanye West with Tucker Carlson.
[00:29:10.628 --> 00:29:16.070]  They released part two of the interview bringing myself up and mass shootings and saying, hey, Alex Jones has a right to question these.
[00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:18.731]  He said Uvalde looked completely scripted to him.
[00:29:18.991 --> 00:29:21.532]  We're not saying it's staged, but the scripting.
[00:29:21.552 --> 00:29:22.492]  We'll explain that in a moment.
[00:29:22.712 --> 00:29:25.053]  But Robert Barnes, how big a deal is this?
[00:29:26.841 --> 00:29:29.983]  Oh, I mean, they're weaponizing the system to try to do two things.
[00:29:30.164 --> 00:29:33.626]  First, to show that they can use show trials against all the rest of us.
[00:29:34.086 --> 00:29:36.688]  If they can do it to Alex Jones, they can do it to anybody else.
[00:29:36.989 --> 00:29:41.232]  They can script the trial so that it looks like a trial, but it's not an actual trial.
[00:29:41.612 --> 00:29:43.653]  Only one side is allowed to present a defense.
[00:29:43.713 --> 00:29:45.475]  Only one side is allowed to testify.
[00:29:45.535 --> 00:29:47.476]  Only one side is allowed to present evidence.
[00:29:47.536 --> 00:29:49.317]  Only one side is allowed to present an argument.
[00:29:49.798 --> 00:29:53.721]  And that side is often allowed to present evidence and argument that has nothing to do with the case.
[00:29:54.361 --> 00:30:10.615]  As we saw throughout this show trial, while the other side can't defend themselves on the core issues, or if you do, as was clear when we were up in Connecticut this week, if you actually refuse to play along with their script, refuse to be their puppet for their show trial, they were going to lock you up for as long as six months.
[00:30:10.856 --> 00:30:12.357]  And there was no doubts about that.
[00:30:12.617 --> 00:30:13.218]  So what was happening?
[00:30:13.238 --> 00:30:20.264]  That's how if you testify truthfully in America, you can now go to jail for testifying truthfully in America.
[00:30:20.644 --> 00:30:22.085]  That's how nuts it is.
[00:30:22.545 --> 00:30:28.307]  Then you compound that with them wanting to use, weaponize the legal system in every aspect of the legal system.
[00:30:28.347 --> 00:30:31.729]  We've been warning about it for years, that this case is the canary in the coal mine.
[00:30:31.749 --> 00:30:32.649]  And what are we witnessing?
[00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:43.514]  We're witnessing raids on pro-life protesters who are being accused of a crime, like in Pennsylvania, like in Tennessee, for protesting abortion clinics and baby killing facilities.
[00:30:44.154 --> 00:30:45.255]  That's how nuts it is.
[00:30:45.295 --> 00:30:47.076]  They're going to weaponize everything.
[00:30:47.116 --> 00:30:49.737]  Now they're saying they're going to arrest people just like in England.
[00:30:50.399 --> 00:30:51.850]  Who criticized transgenderism?
[00:30:51.871 --> 00:30:52.656]  The Justice Department has.
[00:30:53.982 --> 00:30:54.603]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:30:54.723 --> 00:30:55.703]  In fact, it's already happening.
[00:30:55.963 --> 00:31:05.130]  Right now at the Supreme Court, there's a case pending before the United States Supreme Court where somebody was locked up for parody, for parody, for making jokes.
[00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:06.491]  That's how nuts it is.
[00:31:06.831 --> 00:31:11.935]  So that's not supposed to happen in America, but it is happening under the Democratic weaponization of the entire legal system.
[00:31:12.275 --> 00:31:22.863]  And nothing speaks more to it than plaintiffs asking for $8 billion, the largest verdict in the history of man, on a speech case.
[00:31:23.403 --> 00:31:33.608]  $8 billion for people who, when they testified, almost none of them testified that they ever saw or heard you talk about them ever because you didn't talk about them.
[00:31:33.949 --> 00:31:35.249]  You never mentioned their names.
[00:31:35.629 --> 00:31:37.350]  In fact, they never even talked about any of that.
[00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:39.952]  They talked about things almost all unrelated.
[00:31:40.072 --> 00:31:44.354]  Very little of the testimony had anything to do with anything you published or said.
[00:31:44.734 --> 00:31:46.935]  They're trying to blame you for things you had nothing to do with.
[00:31:47.776 --> 00:31:50.497]  And so that shows how the extreme nature of it.
[00:31:50.897 --> 00:31:51.397]  That's right.
[00:31:51.418 --> 00:31:53.679]  We've got the Kanye West clip and so much more straight ahead.
[00:31:53.519 --> 00:31:55.917]  into the Second Amendment concerning dissident speech.
[00:31:55.917 --> 00:32:00.078]   They're going to use this as a template all across the board to go after pro-lifers, to
[00:32:00.078 --> 00:32:05.038]   go after people who expose election misinformation, to people who expose issues with public health
[00:32:05.038 --> 00:32:06.399]  and the lockdowns.
[00:32:06.399 --> 00:32:10.038]   This is the canary in the coal mine and everybody needs to wake up and scream about it or it's
[00:32:10.038 --> 00:32:11.919]  going to be coming for us next.
[00:32:11.919 --> 00:32:12.919]  That's right.
[00:32:12.919 --> 00:32:15.278]   We've got the Kanye West clip and so much more straight ahead.
[00:32:15.278 --> 00:32:17.557]  This is a big deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:17.557 --> 00:32:20.078]   Robert Barnes looked at the analysis a month ago and told us it was going to happen.
[00:32:20.116 --> 00:32:20.736]  People didn't believe him.
[00:32:21.016 --> 00:32:25.277]  Now even mainstream media is freaking out over the biggest show trial in world history.
[00:32:25.297 --> 00:32:34.579]  All right, hour number two is going to be completely, insanely jam-packed with the most critical analysis you're going to find anywhere.
[00:32:34.599 --> 00:32:40.260]  And I'm going to break down what's about to happen to the economy, the war in Ukraine, and so much more.
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.320]  The cold hard facts straight ahead.
[00:32:43.441 --> 00:32:47.063]   But please remember, viewers, We don't stay on air without your support.
[00:32:47.083 --> 00:32:50.888]  We don't have globalist sugar daddies like the Young Turds and all the rest of it.

[00:34:51.121 --> 00:34:52.002]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:34:52.262 --> 00:34:55.044]  All right, Barnes, in the nine minutes we have left to break, you've got to go.
[00:34:56.767 --> 00:35:02.049]  I want to finish up with any comments about the show trial against me, your predictions for the jury that comes back Tuesday.
[00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.989]  They're off on Monday.
[00:35:03.669 --> 00:35:19.577]   And then I want to shift gears into how big is it to have the Surgeon General with a major statewide study that in the last year come out and say an 80 plus percent 87% increase in death in men and heart attacks from young men to old men that take the Pfizer and Moderna shot.
[00:35:19.637 --> 00:35:20.758]  How huge is that?
[00:35:21.198 --> 00:35:22.579]  And what does that say about the Santas?
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:28.564]  And then shifting gears, what do you make of the PayPal coming out with their social credit score?
[00:35:28.584 --> 00:35:29.685]  $2,500 fines.
[00:35:29.925 --> 00:35:30.725]  They're watching you.
[00:35:30.745 --> 00:35:31.706]  They're surveilling you.
[00:35:32.127 --> 00:35:34.308]  They're going to rob you for your speech.
[00:35:34.348 --> 00:35:35.789]  And then they suddenly back down.
[00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:40.593]  That to me is a watermark of the worm turning or the pendulum swinging.
[00:35:40.893 --> 00:35:46.550]   I see this This weekend is a pendulum moment where it stopped and began swinging back.
[00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:47.734]  What do you say to those three topics?
[00:35:49.282 --> 00:35:58.505]  Yeah, I mean, so hopefully there's some conscientious jurors who are able to see through the show trial and come back with a reasonable verdict, given how crazy that whole case has been.
[00:35:58.925 --> 00:35:59.685]  But that's hard.
[00:35:59.705 --> 00:36:15.349]  You're asking jurors to ignore the way that the judge scripted the trial and the plaintiff's lawyer scripted the trial, where the judge basically said, look at these families that have suffered terribly, blame all of it on Alex Jones, even though there's really no connection between one and the other.
[00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:17.510]  So that's going to be the hard part.
[00:36:17.851 --> 00:36:19.432]  And how crazy is the verdict going to be?
[00:36:19.472 --> 00:36:23.735]  Is it going to be one of those wild, insane verdicts like the plaintiffs are demanding?
[00:36:23.855 --> 00:36:25.656]  Any verdict in the seven figures is nuts.
[00:36:25.957 --> 00:36:35.724]  For folks out there, for people that have actually been defamed and actually were talked about by name and had their reputation actually destroyed, the average verdict in America is less than $50,000.
[00:36:37.285 --> 00:36:42.009]  And they're asking for more than $500 million a person and more than $8 billion.
[00:36:42.089 --> 00:36:51.356]  It's a ridiculous request that shows how punitive it is all intended to be about suppressing and censoring speech and rewarding show trials in America.
[00:36:51.596 --> 00:36:54.718]  So that's problem one with overcoming it.
[00:36:55.058 --> 00:36:59.682]  Now, I definitely welcome what DeSantis did and his Surgeon General did.
[00:37:00.002 --> 00:37:05.406]  Twitter tried to actually remove that tweet from Twitter today, and there was enough public outrage.
[00:37:05.486 --> 00:37:08.508]   And what it shows Is more and more court of public opinion.
[00:37:08.868 --> 00:37:16.710]  Like in your case, even the mainstream media started admitting, finally, how unusual, extraordinary, and ridiculous the case was.
[00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:19.050]  Saying that these things have never happened before.
[00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:25.352]  This kind of show trial process, being denied the ability to defend yourself, all the rest hasn't happened.
[00:37:25.712 --> 00:37:31.274]  Well, here again, Florida Surgeon General comes out and says young men are disproportionately dying from this vaccine.
[00:37:31.314 --> 00:37:31.974]  We can't give it.
[00:37:32.314 --> 00:37:36.276]  Sweden and Denmark had already said don't give it to people that are not elderly.
[00:37:36.936 --> 00:37:38.256]  And what does Twitter do?
[00:37:38.316 --> 00:37:39.557]  Twitter tries to suspend it.
[00:37:39.997 --> 00:37:40.777]  Public outrage.
[00:37:40.937 --> 00:37:42.058]  Twitter has to back down.
[00:37:42.498 --> 00:37:45.399]  And this is all while Elon Musk is on the verge of buying Twitter.
[00:37:45.959 --> 00:37:58.506]  So the once again in the settlement there, so that's major news and every aspect of that is major news and PayPal is something that we've been talking about for a little more than a week when I first raised it people thought it was fake.
[00:37:59.231 --> 00:38:00.752]  And said, no, it's not fake.
[00:38:00.772 --> 00:38:01.153]  Dig in.
[00:38:01.173 --> 00:38:02.954]  They're just postponing the implementation.
[00:38:02.994 --> 00:38:04.936]  It's exactly what you described, Alex.
[00:38:05.336 --> 00:38:07.818]  It was a test balloon, a trial balloon.
[00:38:08.118 --> 00:38:17.205]  Could they weaponize access to financial services by politically discriminating against dissident voices, despite the good Texas law on the issue of big tech?
[00:38:17.465 --> 00:38:20.127]  What it shows is we need to expand the legislative remedy.
[00:38:20.427 --> 00:38:26.572]  We need to take what the Texas law is, preventing discrimination by big tech, and apply it to all financial services.
[00:38:26.892 --> 00:38:29.575]  That here again, Alex Jones was the canary in the coal mine.
[00:38:29.896 --> 00:38:30.957]  When did they start doing this?
[00:38:31.137 --> 00:38:31.918]  Several years ago.
[00:38:32.078 --> 00:38:41.188]  Well, I mean, you had to get new servers, you had to get new email providers, you had to get, I mean, all the discrimination by MailChimp, by PayPal... We had to pay...
[00:38:41.789 --> 00:38:44.190]  Over five million dollars the last four years.
[00:38:44.731 --> 00:38:51.135]  They just kept taking the software to literally have all the software we had rewritten because the enemy had articles about it.
[00:38:51.395 --> 00:38:54.197]  They would scan our servers and say, oh, he's got this software.
[00:38:54.517 --> 00:38:55.417]  He's got that software.
[00:38:55.437 --> 00:38:56.578]  People ask why I'm begging for money.
[00:38:56.938 --> 00:38:59.059]  We took on the new world order and we're still here, folks.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:38:59.740]  It's a miracle.
[00:39:01.124 --> 00:39:04.226]  Oh yeah, and that's entirely credit to the audience.
[00:39:04.486 --> 00:39:07.807]  What all of these stories show is the power of the Court of Public Opinion.
[00:39:08.167 --> 00:39:11.389]  That a lot of Republicans were weak initially on the issue of the vaccine.
[00:39:11.629 --> 00:39:22.414]  You're seeing people like DeSantis switch sides and embrace questioning the complete problematic aspects of that vaccine only because the Court of Public Opinion has been spoken out.
[00:39:22.774 --> 00:39:25.676]  And I know you're a fan of Trump like I am.
[00:39:26.196 --> 00:39:29.039]  And you and I and others have begged him to get ahead of this vaccine thing.
[00:39:29.059 --> 00:39:30.400]  I gave him the ultimatum.
[00:39:31.461 --> 00:39:32.702]  We got the information in front of him.
[00:39:32.742 --> 00:39:34.183]  He said, no, I'm going forward with it.
[00:39:34.703 --> 00:39:38.586]  Doesn't he see what DeSantis is doing now coming out against it with his Surgeon General?
[00:39:38.646 --> 00:39:41.309]  I mean, Trump, what's going on with Trump?
[00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:47.434]  The exit rant for Trump on the issue of vaccines is a simple one.
[00:39:47.494 --> 00:39:53.859]  He should embrace the Brooke Jackson whistleblower case that the Biden administration is now trying to intervene to stop.
[00:39:54.389 --> 00:40:01.738]  So the Biden administration sealed the case, wouldn't allow her to discuss the case under the guise that they were investigating the fact.
[00:40:02.119 --> 00:40:04.742]  And by the way, you're the lawyer filing that.
[00:40:05.883 --> 00:40:06.424]  You should add that.
[00:40:07.438 --> 00:40:07.859]  Absolutely.
[00:40:08.319 --> 00:40:09.361]  I'm representing Brooke Jackson.
[00:40:09.681 --> 00:40:21.495]  So our arguments were so persuasive, and what was happening in the Court of Public Opinion was so persuasive, it looked like the court would be compelled to allow our case to go forward against Pfizer, the biggest whistleblower claim in the history of public health.
[00:40:21.916 --> 00:40:25.741]  And at the last minute, the government steps in and says, please, judge, dismiss the case.
[00:40:26.281 --> 00:40:40.714]  So, the only reason for the government to come in and do that, the government's coming in and trying to prevent Pfizer from having to be subject to discovery because it will likely implicate members of the Biden administration in acts of collusion to authorize billions of dollars.
[00:40:40.734 --> 00:40:42.616]  That's right, and Trump can destroy them.
[00:40:42.716 --> 00:40:45.298]  Trump can say he was lied to, but he's not doing it.
[00:40:46.661 --> 00:40:47.661]  Yeah, I mean, it's key.
[00:40:47.941 --> 00:40:51.622]  And that's where, just, the court of public opinion, they keep hammering, hammering, hammering.
[00:40:51.662 --> 00:41:00.344]  The weakness of Trump right now is he doesn't hear enough voices in the court of public opinion, in part because he's off of Twitter, in part because of his own tactical decisions.
[00:41:00.644 --> 00:41:08.006]  But there are people who do listen, who do get the message, and the more he gets that message, the more he will find that there is an exit ramp.
[00:41:08.186 --> 00:41:13.065]   for the mistake he made in embracing it. He thought he was embracing a safe, effective drug.
[00:41:13.065 --> 00:41:17.704]   They lied to him. He should expose that to the world. And that would be his way to bridge the
[00:41:17.704 --> 00:41:22.506]   gap between his prior position and a future manageable, sustainable position. And hopefully
[00:41:22.506 --> 00:41:27.065]   that will happen. But it's a sign we need to expand these big tech discrimination laws
[00:41:27.065 --> 00:41:30.425]  so that banks can't do it to us. I totally agree.
[00:41:30.425 --> 00:41:34.346]   Robert, you'll come back on this week with a minute and a half left.
[00:41:34.574 --> 00:41:35.355]  Big picture, though.
[00:41:35.395 --> 00:41:36.575]  PayPal backing off.
[00:41:37.096 --> 00:41:39.537]  The COVID poison shot news coming out.
[00:41:41.378 --> 00:41:45.119]  Twitter backing off, censoring the Surgeon General of Florida.
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.661]  I think the pendulum's starting to swing back.
[00:41:47.821 --> 00:41:48.341]  Do you agree with me?
[00:41:49.497 --> 00:41:50.137]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:41:50.237 --> 00:41:52.478]  I mean, the court of public opinion is starting to have effect.
[00:41:52.898 --> 00:42:00.341]  A lawyer, Nick Ricada, on YouTube, who's been covering your trial, covered the press conference, talked about how outrageous it was.
[00:42:00.701 --> 00:42:08.344]  The next day, about how outrageous the whole show trial was and how accurate the points we made were, YouTube suspended him, immediately kicked him off.
[00:42:08.725 --> 00:42:13.147]   The only major law tuber outside of us that's been covering the trial But what happened?
[00:42:13.247 --> 00:42:14.488]  Court of Public Opinion outrage.
[00:42:14.628 --> 00:42:15.588]  They had to reinstate him.
[00:42:15.888 --> 00:42:18.690]  So what we're seeing is the Court of Public Opinion is starting to work.
[00:42:18.771 --> 00:42:21.352]  The Court of Public Opinion is starting to be heard.
[00:42:21.733 --> 00:42:24.214]  And here again, the template has been the InfoWars audience.
[00:42:24.555 --> 00:42:30.058]  The InfoWars audience kept InfoWars on the air when it was supposed to be crushed and killed and crucified.
[00:42:30.399 --> 00:42:40.546]  It is thanks to the InfoWars audience going to InfoWarsStore.com, keeping InfoWars alive, keeping it afloat, buying things like the 1776 coin that helped sustain it.
[00:42:40.686 --> 00:42:42.907]   That model is the model we can Exactly.
[00:42:42.987 --> 00:42:46.049]  People directly supporting independent media is what scares the globalists.
[00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.989]  They are so scared of that.
[00:42:47.409 --> 00:42:48.490]  Robert Barnes, thank you so much.
[00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:49.110]  Talk to you soon.
[00:42:50.231 --> 00:42:50.591]  Absolutely.
[00:42:50.691 --> 00:42:51.091]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:42:52.031 --> 00:42:52.272]  All right.
[00:42:52.332 --> 00:42:54.593]  Hour number two is just two minutes ahead.
[00:42:54.753 --> 00:42:55.373]  Stay with us.
[00:42:55.613 --> 00:42:56.714]  Tell people to join us.
[00:42:56.854 --> 00:42:57.314]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:00.163 --> 00:43:01.784]  New vaccine with a new approach.
[00:43:01.944 --> 00:43:06.746]  For most Americans, that means one COVID-19 shot once a year, each fall.
[00:43:07.346 --> 00:43:09.147]  If it sounds familiar, it's because it is.
[00:43:09.327 --> 00:43:12.088]  The White House has been comparing it to the annual flu shot.
[00:43:12.648 --> 00:43:17.010]  Now, more than 200 million people are eligible to get a booster from Pfizer and Moderna.
[00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:20.531]  But questions remain over how many actually will get it.
[00:43:20.951 --> 00:43:26.414]  They intended to never stop the lockdowns in Australia, Canada, Europe, you name it.
[00:43:26.834 --> 00:43:29.816]  The country's zero COVID strategy came at a cost.
[00:43:30.536 --> 00:43:33.938]  Melbourne, capital of Victoria State, had six lockdowns.
[00:43:34.498 --> 00:43:39.421]  Only those who've received the jab are allowed to visit restaurants, gyms and most stores.
[00:43:39.761 --> 00:43:43.925]  No people's freedoms have been taken away.
[00:43:43.965 --> 00:43:46.127]  Some people have willingly thrown it away.
[00:43:46.147 --> 00:43:48.248]  Very restrictive on movement and everything.
[00:43:48.288 --> 00:43:51.191]  It's pretty much like an open-air prison here in Australia.
[00:43:51.671 --> 00:43:58.317]  But I said in December, I can metaphysically, intellectually, economically, culturally see it.
[00:43:58.918 --> 00:44:02.140]  I said we've won this round of the fight but barely.
[00:44:02.461 --> 00:44:06.109]   We're bloodied but we're awake now and We got a chance.
[00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:08.230]  This is not some accidental thing.
[00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:12.790]  These aren't just companies that mean well that screwed up and all this garbage.
[00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:16.791]  These are individuals that are using this to take over the planet.
[00:44:16.911 --> 00:44:18.431]  I see already that it's checkmate.
[00:44:19.012 --> 00:44:26.693]  The only question that's still a variable is how much carnage and what will be the body count of the innocent until we get to that point.
[00:44:26.993 --> 00:44:28.393]  The numbers mirror Israel.
[00:44:29.073 --> 00:44:30.014]  They mirror Europe.
[00:44:30.954 --> 00:44:35.951]   They mirror Areas of Asia that keep the statistics and show it.
[00:44:36.512 --> 00:44:42.354]  Taiwan, the number of people dying after their COVID vaccination is exceeding the number of deaths from the virus itself.
[00:44:42.654 --> 00:44:46.836]  And if you look, the peak of taking the poison shots was in December of 2021.
[00:44:47.016 --> 00:44:54.695]  of 2021. Since then, there is a 99% rejection. 99.
[00:44:55.055 --> 00:44:59.099]  By late May, there will be enough vaccine for every American who wants one.
[00:44:59.499 --> 00:45:01.241]  The problem is, millions don't.
[00:45:01.581 --> 00:45:04.664]  I'm not getting a vaccine because I'm honestly not scared of the virus.
[00:45:05.044 --> 00:45:08.227]  I don't trust the vaccine, um, at all.
[00:45:08.527 --> 00:45:11.970]  Polls suggest a large number of Americans will refuse a vaccine.
[00:45:12.471 --> 00:45:16.494]  Most of them are Republicans, supporters of former President Donald Trump.
[00:45:16.855 --> 00:45:22.119]   How some groups would not want to do it for reasons That I just don't understand.
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:25.483]  Even if it doesn't prevent you from getting COVID, I'm double boosted.
[00:45:25.543 --> 00:45:27.705]  I got it myself here just the last week or so.
[00:45:28.906 --> 00:45:30.968]  It makes the symptoms a lot less severe.
[00:45:30.988 --> 00:45:32.469]  It gets you back on duty.
[00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:39.436]  A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found 29% of the healthcare workers questioned likely would not get the vaccine.
[00:45:39.818 --> 00:45:41.960]  Why did you decide to put your livelihood on the line?
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:54.828]  I felt that what they were doing, what they have done, is they've basically held for ransom your health insurance, your benefits, your livelihood, your career in some cases.
[00:45:55.209 --> 00:45:58.511]  So they've gone from having a helpless population to believe every word they were saying.
[00:45:59.398 --> 00:46:03.680]  And massive uptake of this garbage that erases your immune system and doesn't protect you.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.341]  But now the CDC is saying, oh, we made big mistakes.
[00:46:06.381 --> 00:46:07.201]  It doesn't protect you.
[00:46:07.461 --> 00:46:09.302]  We lied to you, but it was for your own good.
[00:46:09.702 --> 00:46:12.383]  We made some pretty public mistakes, and we need to own them.
[00:46:12.663 --> 00:46:18.026]  The CDC says the review found the agency's COVID guidance was confusing and overwhelming.
[00:46:18.146 --> 00:46:28.830]  We have the CDC document from 2000 and others, where they said it isn't going to work, and it's going to cause massive heart attacks, heart swelling, blood clots, infertility, strokes.
[00:46:31.155 --> 00:46:39.802]  I've talked to a few people along with my 3,500 experts who have looked at the Pfizer documents and I can tell you they knew from a month after the rollout that they did not work.
[00:46:40.143 --> 00:46:48.130]  So the reason I say mass murder with such calmness is that if, and not only that, the FDA knew because at the bottom of these documents it says FDA confidential.
[00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:52.774]  The FDA has custody of these 50,000 documents that Pfizer was forced to reveal.
[00:46:53.094 --> 00:46:55.096]  So they knew that they didn't work.
[00:46:55.416 --> 00:46:57.458]  They knew three months in that 1,200 people were dead.
[00:46:59.019 --> 00:47:01.280]  99 plus percent reduction in people taking it.
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.021]  Now what happens when 99% say no?
[00:47:02.841 --> 00:47:06.841]   in April of last year that children's hearts were being damaged a week after
[00:47:06.841 --> 00:47:14.881]   the injection and they kept going. 99 plus percent reduction in people taking
[00:47:14.881 --> 00:47:23.481]   it. Now what happens when 99 percent say no? All the intimidation, all the threats
[00:47:23.481 --> 00:47:28.401]   that people been under in health care and government and the military being
[00:47:28.401 --> 00:47:31.841]   tortured with this and seeing their friends and family get sick and die, they
[00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:33.410]  Screw you.
[00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:34.571]  Everybody's on my side.
[00:47:34.591 --> 00:47:38.993]  And you have that tipping point, that turning point.
[00:47:40.153 --> 00:47:43.135]  This is spectacularly positive news.
[00:47:43.675 --> 00:47:51.819]  And this information from this show needs to be clipped out and needs to be spread to the four winds because this is victory.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:56.580]  Alright, we're gonna come back with the latest developments.
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:06.580]   We are drugged out. We are following other people's opinions. We are controlled by the media.
[00:48:06.567 --> 00:48:08.128]  Today, it all changes.
[00:48:08.448 --> 00:48:10.908]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[00:48:11.189 --> 00:48:14.050]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:18.771]  Einstein said the death of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[00:48:19.011 --> 00:48:21.892]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
[00:48:22.152 --> 00:48:24.173]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[00:48:24.513 --> 00:48:26.454]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:48:26.934 --> 00:48:28.374]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:48:28.615 --> 00:48:29.775]  We have the resources.
[00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:36.611]  Sometimes you need some crazy motherfuckers to change something.
[00:48:36.691 --> 00:48:37.952]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[00:48:38.132 --> 00:48:39.712]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[00:48:39.752 --> 00:48:40.633]  They say Trump's crazy.
[00:48:40.813 --> 00:48:41.713]  They say I'm crazy.
[00:48:41.893 --> 00:48:44.134]  But I'm here to show love.
[00:48:44.294 --> 00:48:47.935]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[00:48:49.516 --> 00:48:52.997]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:48:53.377 --> 00:48:55.377]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:48:55.377 --> 00:49:04.976]  [MUSIC]
[00:49:04.976 --> 00:49:10.416]   So as negative and crazy as things are, as we enter the second hour of this Sunday live
[00:49:10.416 --> 00:49:18.017]   edition of the Alex Jones Show, people are waking up and very exciting, positive things are happening.
[00:49:18.017 --> 00:49:20.177]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:49:19.938 --> 00:49:25.321]  So Kanye West did a big part two interview aired over two nights Thursday and Friday with Doug Carlson.
[00:49:26.122 --> 00:49:29.452]   Big international news, massive ratings, And I've been busy.
[00:49:29.472 --> 00:49:30.933]  I've been watching Tucker lately.
[00:49:31.293 --> 00:49:32.253]  I watch the clips later.
[00:49:32.873 --> 00:49:34.494]  But Saturday, I heard him getting all the calls.
[00:49:34.554 --> 00:49:36.074]  Hey, Kanye West was on last night.
[00:49:36.094 --> 00:49:37.035]  He talked about InfoWars.
[00:49:39.055 --> 00:49:44.117]  But it's not Kanye West talking about InfoWars that's important.
[00:49:44.917 --> 00:49:45.817]  It's what he was saying.
[00:49:47.398 --> 00:49:53.359]  He talked about how Matthew McConaughey's from Uvalde, how Matthew McConaughey came out against guns.
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:50:00.558]   And then when the kids got attacked and the police stood down for 70 plus minutes, 76 minutes.
[00:50:01.339 --> 00:50:03.280]  How the media was all so coordinated.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:09.403]  Well, somebody like Kanye West has done thousands of concerts and produced dozens of albums and run big businesses.
[00:50:10.523 --> 00:50:11.904]  He knows when something's scripted.
[00:50:11.924 --> 00:50:15.786]  We're not saying kids didn't die at Uvalde, but you see the scripting.
[00:50:15.806 --> 00:50:16.706]  You see the media.
[00:50:16.746 --> 00:50:19.588]  You see it unified within minutes of it breaking.
[00:50:19.628 --> 00:50:22.309]  They're all saying the same thing on all the different channels.
[00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:25.571]  So he says, is that Alex Jones territory?
[00:50:27.173 --> 00:50:34.338]  Why, when a crazy black supremacist runs over a bunch of white people in Kenosha, do they cover it up and say an SUV attacked people?
[00:50:34.939 --> 00:50:41.824]  Or why, when 20-something black youth die a week in Chicago, is there no news covering it?
[00:50:41.844 --> 00:50:44.006]  So it's what they choose to focus in on.
[00:50:44.026 --> 00:50:48.429]  And obviously, the state police say that the Evaldi Police Department lied.
[00:50:49.431 --> 00:50:50.532]  The FBI says they lied.
[00:50:50.692 --> 00:50:51.873]  We don't even know what happened there.
[00:50:52.153 --> 00:50:57.057]  There's video of over 70 plus minutes of cops putting hand sanitizer on and just walking around.
[00:50:57.497 --> 00:50:59.418]  Meanwhile, the whole script and story is already out there.
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:03.121]  So, it's the analogy I use.
[00:51:03.662 --> 00:51:07.725]  I remember back six years ago, Hillary did a town hall.
[00:51:08.245 --> 00:51:10.186]  It looked like it was shot in 80 millimeter film.
[00:51:11.447 --> 00:51:15.310]  Super HD, dust in the air, you can see kids asking her questions.
[00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:16.211]  It looked like a movie.
[00:51:16.311 --> 00:51:24.285]   It was produced so good, That you could look at it and say, this isn't a town hall, this looks like a movie.
[00:51:24.585 --> 00:51:37.255]  How does she say it's a live town hall when it's all super HD, perfect cuts, perfect comments, no mics messing up, no audio problems, no video problems, no nothing.
[00:51:37.535 --> 00:51:43.680]  You can look at something and say that's high production versus live and real.
[00:51:45.961 --> 00:51:49.705]   We weren't saying That these events didn't happen.
[00:51:49.825 --> 00:51:53.047]  We were saying this looks controlled, manipulated.
[00:51:53.067 --> 00:51:54.028]  We should investigate this.
[00:51:54.668 --> 00:51:58.811]  And it came out that it was not a live town hall Hillary had.
[00:51:58.851 --> 00:52:02.393]  It was shot over a week with actors.
[00:52:05.936 --> 00:52:06.856]  And that was mainstream news.
[00:52:08.938 --> 00:52:13.603]   So you can see When something's synthetic.
[00:52:13.663 --> 00:52:17.145]  Now, why did she script the town hall that she ran ads for and promoted everywhere?
[00:52:17.165 --> 00:52:18.705]  Because she wanted to look just right.
[00:52:19.366 --> 00:52:23.607]  But the point was, we could see that it wasn't a live feed.
[00:52:23.667 --> 00:52:24.508]  It wasn't real.
[00:52:24.528 --> 00:52:35.892]  Now, I've used the analogy a lot of everybody's walked in a, usually it's a department store, but you're buying a mattress, you're buying some pots and pans and on like a table, they'll have fruit.
[00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:38.771]  And you just look at it from 20 feet away, you know that's fake fruit.
[00:52:39.291 --> 00:52:40.191]  You don't need to go pick it up.
[00:52:40.331 --> 00:52:41.272]  You can look at it.
[00:52:41.292 --> 00:52:42.952]  You just know it looks too good.
[00:52:42.992 --> 00:52:44.213]  It looks too bright.
[00:52:44.273 --> 00:52:45.193]  It just doesn't look right.
[00:52:45.253 --> 00:52:46.893]  You know what a real pear looks like.
[00:52:47.254 --> 00:52:49.234]  What a real apple looks like.
[00:52:49.274 --> 00:52:50.915]  What a real orange looks like.
[00:52:51.495 --> 00:52:52.975]  You know it's fake.
[00:52:53.156 --> 00:52:55.136]  You walk over, it's plastic, you pick it up, yeah that's fake.
[00:52:56.217 --> 00:52:57.357]  That's all Kanye's saying.
[00:52:58.817 --> 00:52:59.797]  And then it's coordinated.
[00:53:00.198 --> 00:53:02.378]  And they don't want us looking into what are they doing.
[00:53:02.618 --> 00:53:06.660]  Because we're not sure exactly what type of plastic the fruit's made out of.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.321]  Is it melamine?
[00:53:08.381 --> 00:53:09.781]  Is it... We don't know.
[00:53:10.261 --> 00:53:11.782]  But we know it's fake.
[00:53:13.783 --> 00:53:18.605]  And it's that crime that they want me punished for questioning what's going on.
[00:53:19.105 --> 00:53:22.366]  So Kanye West comes out and wears a White Lives Matter shirt.
[00:53:23.207 --> 00:53:24.887]  We sold shirts that said All Lives Matter.
[00:53:24.907 --> 00:53:26.768]  It said Black Lives Matter.
[00:53:28.217 --> 00:53:29.177]  Brown lives matter.
[00:53:29.778 --> 00:53:30.698]  Yellow lives matter.
[00:53:31.238 --> 00:53:31.898]  White lives matter.
[00:53:32.158 --> 00:53:34.639]  And what he said is, I figured this is something God would want.
[00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:37.800]  Which, absolutely, I'll wear a shirt that says Black Lives Matter.
[00:53:38.221 --> 00:53:39.581]  Except I don't want to be connected to the left.
[00:53:39.661 --> 00:53:41.342]  But I'll still wear it, because all lives matter.
[00:53:41.742 --> 00:53:45.723]  He did that to bring unity and stop the division and go against the system.
[00:53:46.063 --> 00:53:47.964]  He has a lot of courage.
[00:53:47.984 --> 00:53:48.924]  And so does Candace Owens.
[00:53:51.305 --> 00:53:52.346]  And that's what this is all about.
[00:53:54.906 --> 00:53:56.247]  And we woke up Candace Owens.
[00:53:57.383 --> 00:53:59.285]  And InfoWars first got Candace Owens on air.
[00:53:59.605 --> 00:54:03.308]  And she knows that and has apologized to me on air for not defending us when we got censored.
[00:54:03.508 --> 00:54:04.329]  That's okay, Candace.
[00:54:04.929 --> 00:54:07.031]  You have gone through a lot and you've grown a lot.
[00:54:07.051 --> 00:54:07.912]  You're a great leader now.
[00:54:08.392 --> 00:54:09.473]  We're so blessed you're there.
[00:54:10.193 --> 00:54:12.815]  But that's the whole point is we woke up Kanye West, folks.
[00:54:14.297 --> 00:54:16.398]  That doesn't mean Alex E. Jones did that.
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:19.241]  It means only you did that.
[00:54:19.301 --> 00:54:28.540]   So, right after he does this, Instagram blocks him, Facebook blocks him, And the media is like, well he deserves it, CNN, because they're scared of him.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:31.781]  Kanye West Instagram account restricted.
[00:54:33.522 --> 00:54:34.503]  He returns to Twitter.
[00:54:35.823 --> 00:54:38.765]  Kanye West says, have I reached Alex Jones territory yet?
[00:54:40.566 --> 00:54:44.748]  The entire Uvalde Police Department has just been suspended yesterday.
[00:54:46.409 --> 00:54:51.611]  Meanwhile, jury deciding how much money will Alex Jones pay for Sandy Hook families for years of lies.
[00:54:51.872 --> 00:54:52.552]  What are the lies?
[00:54:52.672 --> 00:54:53.212]  Questioning it?
[00:54:53.552 --> 00:54:54.433]  Saying it looks staged?
[00:54:56.351 --> 00:54:57.672]  Here's another one out of Law.com.
[00:54:58.012 --> 00:55:01.093]  Billions in compensatory damages requested in Alex Jones' trial.
[00:55:01.414 --> 00:55:02.754]  We told you this on Thursday.
[00:55:02.894 --> 00:55:04.455]  Listeners thought I was making it up.
[00:55:05.396 --> 00:55:06.676]  They're like, Alex, come on.
[00:55:06.716 --> 00:55:09.818]  We know you don't lie, but they're not asking for $8 billion.
[00:55:12.619 --> 00:55:13.880]  They're asking for $550 million per person.
[00:55:18.666 --> 00:55:21.127]  Which is $8.25 billion.
[00:55:21.708 --> 00:55:22.108]  $8.25 billion.
[00:55:22.148 --> 00:55:25.210]  Let me tell you why it's such a joke while I'm not losing sleep.
[00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:27.791]  I don't have between my company and me $2 million.
[00:55:28.352 --> 00:55:29.212]  We're out of money here.
[00:55:29.452 --> 00:55:30.333]  I told everybody that.
[00:55:31.254 --> 00:55:33.195]  Don't make me prove it by shutting down when you need your support.
[00:55:33.615 --> 00:55:35.076]  But look at this article on Law.com.
[00:55:36.425 --> 00:55:48.089]  In closing arguments in the damages phase of the Alex Jones Civil Trial, the plaintiff's lawyers asked the jury to award $8.2 billion in compensatory damages, $550 million for each of the 15 plaintiffs for the defamation claims.
[00:55:48.129 --> 00:55:59.074]  In response, Jones' defense attorney, Norm Pattis, argued for the jurors to view the evidence dispassionately for equal justice under the law and was admonished by the Superior Court Judge, Barbara Bellis, for his point.
[00:55:59.734 --> 00:56:00.634]  He's not allowed to talk.
[00:56:01.054 --> 00:56:01.955]  I'm not allowed to talk.
[00:56:02.115 --> 00:56:02.695]  It's all rigged.
[00:56:03.447 --> 00:56:06.669]  Here's Kanye West talking about Izzy and Alex Jones territory.
[00:56:06.689 --> 00:56:07.650]  I think we all are.
[00:56:09.351 --> 00:56:14.954]  Did watching COVID and the medical establishment's response to COVID over two years change your view?
[00:56:18.016 --> 00:56:19.197]  I mean, that was a piece of it.
[00:56:19.457 --> 00:56:20.578]  That was a piece of it.
[00:56:20.618 --> 00:56:21.379]  What did you think of that?
[00:56:21.399 --> 00:56:27.443]  I mean, specifically, I'm going to lean into the black condition, just for, you know, being a black person.
[00:56:28.343 --> 00:56:30.905]  You know, we've been getting killed in hospitals.
[00:56:32.119 --> 00:56:32.640]  For years.
[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:34.722]  Grandma and Mom don't come out.
[00:56:35.662 --> 00:56:39.146]  You know, we've been getting killed with our food to start off with.
[00:56:39.626 --> 00:56:41.448]  We've been getting killed by police officers.
[00:56:42.229 --> 00:56:45.151]  You know, every day we've been killing each other.
[00:56:46.393 --> 00:56:46.953]  In the streets.
[00:56:48.034 --> 00:56:48.454]  Every day.
[00:56:49.055 --> 00:56:57.203]  You know, I felt like the people at The Gap knew about the school shooting that Matthew McConaughey was talking about before it even happened.
[00:56:58.413 --> 00:57:07.152]  It was so in sync, the information, and then I heard about it on the radio, driving, and I was like, am I in the Truman Show?
[00:57:07.954 --> 00:57:08.294]  Right now?
[00:57:09.508 --> 00:57:11.349]  And I tell Candace, she's gotta watch the Truman Show.
[00:57:11.369 --> 00:57:12.630]  You gotta, you have to watch the Truman Show.
[00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:15.052]  What do you mean the people at The Gap knew about the school shooting?
[00:57:15.092 --> 00:57:16.332]  I think in Uvalde, Texas?
[00:57:16.673 --> 00:57:16.833]  Yeah.
[00:57:17.033 --> 00:57:22.056]  I'm not saying that they did, but it felt so in sync.
[00:57:23.037 --> 00:57:30.862]  This idea of like this media rush over the 78 specific outlets that influence.
[00:57:32.763 --> 00:57:35.925]  Meanwhile... So there's a coordinated message, I think that's what you said.
[00:57:35.945 --> 00:57:36.085]  Yeah.
[00:57:36.465 --> 00:57:37.026]  Meanwhile...
[00:57:39.358 --> 00:57:50.844]  There's the same amount of kids getting killed in Chicago every week, but there's no coordinated message about that.
[00:57:51.524 --> 00:57:53.625]  Have I reached Alex Jones territory yet?
[00:57:54.025 --> 00:57:58.788]  No, I think you're telling the truth.
[00:58:00.149 --> 00:58:03.670]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[00:58:04.311 --> 00:58:08.713]  We're all in Alex Jones territory now, as Kanye West was just saying.
[00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:13.412]  Every one of you that's tuned in is a very special person, and I mean that.
[00:58:13.973 --> 00:58:15.814]  The future of humanity is in your hands.
[00:58:16.214 --> 00:58:18.156]  God's given us control of our destiny.
[00:58:18.716 --> 00:58:30.985]  If you decide to execute it, that's why when you take the articles and videos and your private texts, your emails, word of mouth, and share them, you override the AI censorship that is so incredibly intense right now.
[00:58:32.706 --> 00:58:38.631]  So I mentioned this last hour with Robert Barnes, and I want to drill back into this right now because this is a big deal.
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:46.999]   On Friday, PayPal came out with new terms of service and said, "If we don't like what you
[00:58:46.999 --> 00:58:52.200]   say about a list of issues, global warming, open borders, gun control, election fraud, vaccines,
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:58.838]   you name it, anything that Bill Gates and his organizations and the Southern Poverty Law Center
[00:58:58.838 --> 00:59:05.640]   and the ADL says, you say anything we don't like that's true, of course, we're going to take $2,500
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:12.359]  outside of law, outside of the courts, out of your account."
[00:59:12.521 --> 00:59:16.243]  Now the first thing I thought when I saw that once I got off air Friday, because I missed it.
[00:59:16.543 --> 00:59:17.823]  It broke in the morning, but I missed it.
[00:59:20.945 --> 00:59:22.606]  Was this is the global social credit score.
[00:59:23.587 --> 00:59:28.249]  But the second thing I thought was the most important point that nobody's been making until today.
[00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:30.710]  And that's what frustrates this.
[00:59:32.051 --> 00:59:33.472]  I don't want to do this all the time.
[00:59:33.552 --> 00:59:34.332]  I don't have to.
[00:59:35.433 --> 00:59:36.353]  People should get this.
[00:59:36.373 --> 00:59:37.374]  They don't need me to tell them.
[00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:39.451]  Folks, use your brains.
[00:59:40.351 --> 00:59:42.173]  What's the big elephant in the room here?
[00:59:43.654 --> 00:59:44.295]  With PayPal?
[00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:48.678]  Saying, if we don't like what you say, we're going to censor you.
[00:59:49.118 --> 00:59:49.959]  Yeah, that's illegal.
[00:59:50.259 --> 00:59:53.041]  Yeah, they're making themselves judge, jury, executioner.
[00:59:53.662 --> 00:59:54.442]  Yes, it's tyranny.
[00:59:54.482 --> 00:59:55.884]  Yes, it's the social credit score.
[00:59:57.605 --> 00:59:58.606]  But what's bigger than that?
[01:00:00.787 --> 01:00:02.208]  Let that sink in for a minute.
[01:00:02.649 --> 01:00:11.679]   What's the issue that's the biggest of a bunch of bad ones of this power grab, of this insanity, of this arrogance, of
[01:00:11.679 --> 01:00:16.690]   this tone deafness that they think they could just do this and get away with it when it's
[01:00:16.690 --> 01:00:17.930]  right on the book of revelations.
[01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:27.369]   Maybe I should open the phones up and not answer the question.
[01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:29.365]  Because if I just blurt it out, nobody cares.
[01:00:29.385 --> 01:00:35.289]  But if I build it up, because it is a big deal, then some caller is going to call in and they're going to figure it out.
[01:00:36.547 --> 01:00:38.949]  But I noticed finally one person on Twitter.
[01:00:39.409 --> 01:00:48.676]  I spent hours yesterday, hours today on my desktop on Twitter and searching Instagram and Facebook trying to find somebody.
[01:00:48.936 --> 01:00:54.320]  I searched Google News and nobody was saying it until about one o'clock today.
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.882]  I found one tweet that got it.
[01:00:59.443 --> 01:01:01.063]  What's bigger than them bullying you?
[01:01:01.283 --> 01:01:04.344]  What's bigger than them saying they'll take money out of your account and censor you?
[01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:08.205]  What's bigger than their arrogance and their bravado and their chutzpah?
[01:01:11.886 --> 01:01:12.326]  Think about it.
[01:01:15.447 --> 01:01:34.487]   Who set up the banks and PayPal, one of the first online purchasing systems, Who set up this digital wallet to be God and to decide who has free speech?
[01:01:34.987 --> 01:01:37.349]  I mean, obviously they shouldn't be deciding who has free speech.
[01:01:37.669 --> 01:01:41.191]  And who's deciding what is speech you'll be fined for?
[01:01:41.271 --> 01:01:41.852]  That's big.
[01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:45.354]  But how do they know?
[01:01:45.374 --> 01:01:49.717]  Because what I'm going to say is so simple, once you hear it, you're going to be like, oh my God.
[01:01:53.599 --> 01:01:57.121]  What is it that's so criminal, that's so evil, that's so wrong?
[01:02:01.824 --> 01:02:03.605]  I'll tell you, and I think most of you already know it.
[01:02:04.685 --> 01:02:14.091]  They have anointed themselves to not just decide what speech is okay and what speech is going to get fined.
[01:02:14.551 --> 01:02:17.132]  And once you put up with not saying those things, they're going to have a bigger list.
[01:02:17.673 --> 01:02:18.413]  This is just the start.
[01:02:18.893 --> 01:02:19.614]  That's all huge.
[01:02:20.574 --> 01:02:21.495]  But what's even bigger?
[01:02:23.978 --> 01:02:25.177]  Drumroll please.
[01:02:25.177 --> 01:02:33.177]  They're surveilling you!
[01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:35.163]  They're spying on you!
[01:02:35.563 --> 01:02:38.305]  They're watching what you say off-platform.
[01:02:38.645 --> 01:02:43.267]  Remember Facebook and Google and Twitter said we're gonna censor you for what you say off-platform.
[01:02:43.507 --> 01:02:54.715]   It's not just that you're saying something they're gonna fine you for when you're using PayPal, but they're saying I'm watching you I'm surveilling you!
[01:02:54.736 --> 01:02:56.160]  I'm spying on you!
[01:02:59.272 --> 01:03:02.493]  Imagine if the NSA that we know is spying on us and the U.S.
[01:03:02.553 --> 01:03:13.556]  government came out and said, if you talk about supporting Trump or the Second Amendment or Alex Jones or securing our borders or stopping fentanyl or not having a nuclear war, we're going to fine you $2,500.
[01:03:13.836 --> 01:03:15.357]  There'd be a revolution.
[01:03:15.597 --> 01:03:17.337]  The Supreme Court would strike it down.
[01:03:17.738 --> 01:03:19.498]  Everyone would come out in the streets by the millions.
[01:03:19.758 --> 01:03:28.521]  But because big tech, who's trained us to submit to slavery and censorship and control, says, hey, hey.
[01:03:29.614 --> 01:03:31.235]  Slap you upside your face, you know, American.
[01:03:31.575 --> 01:03:43.664]  We're watching you, everything you do, surveilling you on platform and off platform, and we've got a group of people that decide what you can say and what you can't say.
[01:03:43.784 --> 01:03:52.630]  A group of Stasi, a group of Nazis, a group of communists, a group of authoritarians, a group of dangerous, evil terrorists.
[01:03:52.830 --> 01:04:01.679]   literally that are watching you. Remember the beginning of that
[01:04:01.679 --> 01:04:05.810]   incredible film that Oliver Stone spent a decade writing off real people
[01:04:05.810 --> 01:04:06.710]  interviewed real things.
[01:04:06.797 --> 01:04:13.080]  It's a real movie, like The Godfather, written by Mario Puzo, is real people, they just changed the names.
[01:04:13.481 --> 01:04:18.183]  It's Frank Sinatra as the singer, and you know, the Dons, the main family, they just changed the names.
[01:04:18.223 --> 01:04:20.224]  It wasn't, you know, Carlioni, it was Gambino.
[01:04:22.546 --> 01:04:30.739]   And you watch that movie and you're like, this feels like it's real, it's like Narcos Mexico is one of the best things I've ever watched because I've studied the history.
[01:04:30.779 --> 01:04:31.499]  It's like dead on.
[01:04:31.519 --> 01:04:33.541]  You're like watching a documentary in HD.
[01:04:33.781 --> 01:04:34.722]  It's incredible.
[01:04:34.742 --> 01:04:37.664]  You can't stop watching it because it's real, folks.
[01:04:41.606 --> 01:04:48.011]  And these people are literally watching you in live time.
[01:04:49.364 --> 01:04:55.685]  And everything you're doing and saying will fine you $2,500 to begin with if you don't do what we want.
[01:04:56.085 --> 01:04:57.105]  What a group of criminals.
[01:04:57.405 --> 01:04:58.346]  What a group of bullies.
[01:04:58.666 --> 01:04:59.466]  What a group of thugs.
[01:04:59.486 --> 01:05:01.886]  I mean, there's not words to describe this.
[01:05:03.206 --> 01:05:14.448]  PayPal came out and said, we're watching and surveilling you on our platform, what you're buying, what you're doing, who you're supporting, and we're watching you everywhere else.
[01:05:14.668 --> 01:05:15.808]  Well, who is watching us?
[01:05:16.068 --> 01:05:17.069]  Who are these criminals?
[01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:18.949]  Who are they?
[01:05:22.725 --> 01:05:23.466]  They need to be arrested.
[01:05:23.506 --> 01:05:24.806]  They don't need to just be boycotted.
[01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:26.408]  Their stock doesn't need to be down 11%.
[01:05:27.108 --> 01:05:30.150]  The company needs to be shut down.
[01:05:31.091 --> 01:05:51.708]   The people that did it need to go to prison for the rest of their lives because they're a danger against everybody else and they're run by the big banks that thought in late in the year 2022, it was a good time, long after they banned Alex Jones, to come out and say, listen you dirty, filthy Americans, we're watching your ass.
[01:05:52.489 --> 01:05:56.691]  And if you do one thing we don't like, we're gonna fine you and kick you off our platform.
[01:05:57.492 --> 01:05:58.833]  What a group of criminals.
[01:05:59.273 --> 01:06:00.534]  But I'll tell you what's really pathetic.
[01:06:02.095 --> 01:06:02.515]  It's us.
[01:06:03.636 --> 01:06:10.821]  If we put up with crap like this, and turn our world over to people like this, we deserve everything we've got.
[01:06:14.941 --> 01:06:17.424]  I want to get to the transgender mafia that folks are waking up to.
[01:06:17.845 --> 01:06:18.946]  The latest big developments there.
[01:06:18.966 --> 01:06:19.727]  They're the biggest yet.
[01:06:20.087 --> 01:06:22.089]  On the other side, InfoWars.com.
[01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:23.371]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:06:23.651 --> 01:06:24.092]  Stay with us.
[01:06:26.832 --> 01:06:33.454]  Imagine a virus, the most terrifying virus you can, and then imagine that you and you alone have the cure.
[01:06:33.934 --> 01:06:37.855]  But if your ultimate goal is power, how best to use such a weapon?
[01:06:38.215 --> 01:06:54.605]   A newly elected government seeking power and control develops a secret bioweapon and launches it against its own population to establish authoritarian rule and to blame the attack on their political enemies.
[01:06:55.285 --> 01:07:14.121]  Taking pages right out of the 20th century, we see this fictional dictatorship not just seeking to dominate and control the population, but to be seen as saviors of the very people that they are dumbing down, enslaving, imprisoning, and killing.
[01:07:14.838 --> 01:07:21.185]  The writers had a deep historical well to work from in just the 20th century.
[01:07:21.865 --> 01:07:41.067]   With monsters like Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez, Kim Jong Un, Who don't just seek to dominate and control the very lives and thoughts of their minions, but who also want to be seen as the savior by the very people who are their slaves.
[01:07:41.327 --> 01:07:46.972]  Tonight, I will speak directly to these people and make the situation perfectly clear to them.
[01:07:47.652 --> 01:07:52.193]  The security of this nation depends on complete and total compliance.
[01:07:52.513 --> 01:08:01.035]  So, of course, in the film, those that release the bioweapon on their own population that they're preying on also have the cure.
[01:08:01.355 --> 01:08:04.556]  Lo and behold, a miracle.
[01:08:04.576 --> 01:08:13.658]  Some believed it was the work of God himself, but it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members that made them all obscenely rich.
[01:08:14.178 --> 01:08:26.884]   But the end result, the true genius of the plan, Fear became the ultimate tool of this government, and through it, our politician was ultimately appointed to the newly created position of High Chancellor.
[01:08:27.324 --> 01:08:32.069]  In V for Vendetta, we truly see art imitating life.
[01:08:32.169 --> 01:08:33.871]  This is clearly an offense.
[01:08:38.073 --> 01:08:54.943]  This is only the beginning to train you to be locked down so in the future when the really deadly bioweapons are released and billions begin dying you sit there believing governments and corporations are actually your savior and are going to shepherd you and protect you when in truth they're Judas goats leading you into the slaughter.
[01:08:58.805 --> 01:09:02.067]  That report is from two and a half years ago in February of 2020.
[01:09:05.382 --> 01:09:08.823]  We have the keys of victory, the keys of destiny, but we must use them.
[01:09:09.623 --> 01:09:13.604]  Thanks for joining us on the Sunday, October 9th, 2022 transmission.
[01:09:15.645 --> 01:09:30.189]  So, they're launching bio-attacks, they're launching poison shots, they're launching shutdown of food worldwide, destroying energy, shipping and fentanyl and other deadly drugs, weaponized marijuana, the cause of schizophrenia and major brain damage.
[01:09:32.649 --> 01:09:34.470]  They're hitting the human population at every level.
[01:09:37.276 --> 01:09:40.918]  And transgenderism is another one of those angles.
[01:09:42.819 --> 01:09:47.162]  If an adult wants to drink Drano, they have a right to do so.
[01:09:47.802 --> 01:09:50.644]  If an adult wants to chop their testicles off, they can do it.
[01:09:52.565 --> 01:09:55.147]  But children can't make a decision to join the military.
[01:09:55.507 --> 01:09:56.607]  They can't take out loans.
[01:09:56.647 --> 01:09:58.148]  They can't buy alcohol or guns.
[01:09:58.669 --> 01:10:04.212]  They can't join the Marine Corps or the Army or the Air Force or the Coast Guard or the Navy.
[01:10:06.445 --> 01:10:15.777]  But all over the world, governments are trying and passing laws, in many cases, removing parents from parental control and putting the state involved.
[01:10:16.678 --> 01:10:21.024]  Particularly disabled children, autistic children, are being tricked to be sterilized.
[01:10:21.444 --> 01:10:24.148]  This is another form of abortion, post-abortion.
[01:10:25.362 --> 01:10:26.123]  Sterilization.
[01:10:26.543 --> 01:10:26.943]  Eugenics.
[01:10:27.744 --> 01:10:28.764]  So here's the stack of news.
[01:10:29.405 --> 01:10:40.632]  Controversial Vanderbilt University Medical Center spins transgender operations for kids following video of hospital doctor boasting how surgeries are huge money makers.
[01:10:41.292 --> 01:10:42.593]  Remember that video from two weeks ago?
[01:10:43.976 --> 01:10:49.702]  They make $400,000 off a girl just from age 10 to 18 when they cut her breast off.
[01:10:50.402 --> 01:10:51.683]  Fry her with male hormones.
[01:10:52.344 --> 01:10:56.248]  Of course, she's going to live probably 30 years less, but it's okay because they're liberals.
[01:10:58.490 --> 01:11:00.332]  But the good news is humanity's waking up.
[01:11:01.233 --> 01:11:02.314]  Here's another sick clip.
[01:11:02.334 --> 01:11:03.395]  We'll play this in a little while.
[01:11:04.676 --> 01:11:09.059]  Babies know they're trans once born, says Harvard-affiliated hospital.
[01:11:09.719 --> 01:11:18.926]  And the government will decide at birth whether you're a boy or girl and will begin the sterilization process even though a baby doesn't even know who it is and is basically unconscious.
[01:11:20.922 --> 01:11:23.524]  Diagnosis of youths from gender dysphoria.
[01:11:23.564 --> 01:11:24.484]  In 2017, it was 15,172.
[01:11:24.524 --> 01:11:24.484]  2018, 18,000.
[01:11:24.624 --> 01:11:24.484]  2019, 21,000.
[01:11:24.704 --> 01:11:25.405]  2020, 24,000.
[01:11:24.784 --> 01:11:25.405]  2021, 42,000.
[01:11:24.845 --> 01:11:25.405]  Get the picture?
[01:11:25.425 --> 01:11:26.025]  A total complete takeover.
[01:11:25.845 --> 01:11:35.885]   thousand 172 2018 18,000 2019 21,000 2020 24,000 2021 42,000 get the picture a
[01:11:35.885 --> 01:11:42.324]   total complete takeover meanwhile angry mom wears same skimpy outfit as drag
[01:11:42.324 --> 01:11:50.605]   queen performed in high school to expose hypocrisy the board meeting report you
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.562]  I'm going to cover this all tomorrow on the weekday show.
[01:11:50.382 --> 01:11:55.542]   online post criticizing the targeting of children for sterilization. That's where
[01:11:55.542 --> 01:11:58.981]   America is going. Another video, I'm gonna cover this all tomorrow on the
[01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:04.422]   weekday show, CBS News report frames removal of gay porn books from
[01:12:04.422 --> 01:12:09.862]   Children's Library as banning books. This guy really wants you to see these
[01:12:09.862 --> 01:12:15.542]  stories. But there's good news.
[01:12:14.076 --> 01:12:20.118]  GOP Governor signs law withholding funds from hospitals providing transgender care to children.
[01:12:20.759 --> 01:12:24.100]  That's Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stint.
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:26.140]  And we have this video.
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:29.501]  Planned Parenthood cartoons touts puberty blockers for children.
[01:12:31.782 --> 01:12:32.202]  Horror!
[01:12:32.262 --> 01:12:36.364]  Young girl coercion to gender transition surgery limits being mutilated by doctors.
[01:12:36.404 --> 01:12:40.425]  We're playing it all in a special hour of the show tomorrow.
[01:12:42.185 --> 01:12:43.986]  And it goes on and on.
[01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:45.627]  Some women have penises.
[01:12:45.846 --> 01:12:48.246]  If you don't sleep with them, you're transphobic.
[01:12:48.246 --> 01:12:59.646]   There's a major filmmaker that came out and put out a film in the last few months that's gone viral,
[01:12:59.646 --> 01:13:02.045]  exposing the targeting of children.
[01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:12.045]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:13:04.177 --> 01:13:05.098]  And that's Matt Walsh.
[01:13:05.925 --> 01:13:09.410]  And now they're calling for his deplatforming, for him to be silenced.
[01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:12.454]  But instead of bowing and apologizing, he hit him hard.
[01:13:12.474 --> 01:13:12.894]  Here it is.
[01:13:15.377 --> 01:13:17.861]  So here's my official answer, for the record.
[01:13:20.684 --> 01:13:21.365]  Kiss my ass.
[01:13:22.847 --> 01:13:23.868]  I do not apologize.
[01:13:25.458 --> 01:13:38.308]  In fact, by all rights, you sick freaks should be the ones apologizing to me for lying and defaming me and doing it all because I'm trying to prevent you from sexually mutilating children.
[01:13:39.829 --> 01:13:41.130]  You damned monsters.
[01:13:42.170 --> 01:13:44.592]  You child-abusing psychopaths.
[01:13:45.893 --> 01:13:50.597]  I wouldn't apologize to you soulless parasites if I had a gun to my head.
[01:13:52.858 --> 01:13:54.600]  Instead, I'd rather just tell you all to piss off.
[01:13:55.734 --> 01:13:57.094]  I apologize for nothing.
[01:13:57.894 --> 01:13:58.935]  I concede nothing.
[01:13:59.895 --> 01:14:06.056]  I will never surrender even a single inch of ground to a pitchfork mob of degenerate morons.
[01:14:08.216 --> 01:14:16.838]  You know, the secret they never say out loud is that nobody is truly canceled unless they consent to it and they willingly play their assigned roles.
[01:14:17.818 --> 01:14:19.158]  Well, I do not consent.
[01:14:20.698 --> 01:14:21.818]  And I'm not going to play the game.
[01:14:24.019 --> 01:14:25.059]  I'm not going anywhere.
[01:14:27.077 --> 01:14:28.118]  I do not consent.
[01:14:28.939 --> 01:14:29.941]  I will not be censored.
[01:14:31.302 --> 01:14:32.544]  In fact, I'm about to start.
[01:14:32.664 --> 01:14:34.126]  We're months behind, but it's about to start.
[01:14:34.606 --> 01:14:35.367]  Whole new shows.
[01:14:35.427 --> 01:14:36.629]  Commercial-free podcast.
[01:14:37.049 --> 01:14:37.890]  Bunch of new stuff.
[01:14:37.970 --> 01:14:39.072]  It's like a year in the works.
[01:14:39.773 --> 01:14:40.874]  Because they try to silence us.
[01:14:41.395 --> 01:14:44.378]  This is the time to put every ounce of energy we've got in the fight.
[01:14:44.799 --> 01:14:46.060]  I've got some other key clips.
[01:14:46.681 --> 01:14:51.142]  We're going to play, dealing with this when we come back in the final segment of my Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:14:51.162 --> 01:14:59.685]  But Owen Troyer and Sunday Live's coming up exclusively on stations that carry it and InfoWars.com forward slash show and Bandai videos.
[01:14:59.725 --> 01:15:03.386]  So please stay with us and share the links as we're fighting hard here for humanity.
[01:15:03.626 --> 01:15:06.406]  They want us to give in, to normalize it, to buckle.
[01:15:06.466 --> 01:15:07.307]  We're not going to do it.
[01:15:09.027 --> 01:15:09.507]  Separately.
[01:15:11.268 --> 01:15:15.909]  If you would just try one of our iodine products, X2 or X3, you would experience it.
[01:15:18.703 --> 01:15:26.888]  The UN estimates 2 plus billion people have cognitive disabilities and infertility because they never had enough iodine growing up.
[01:15:27.629 --> 01:15:30.511]  You can't fix what happened earlier, but you can make things better now.
[01:15:31.231 --> 01:15:35.334]   Most iodine is a bound type, tied to some other Element.
[01:15:35.934 --> 01:15:40.917]  We have the Tri-Ion with all three types of Deep Earth Crystal, two other types, for the best upload.
[01:15:41.177 --> 01:15:44.658]  X3 exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:16:12.236 --> 01:16:12.696]  Stay with us.
[01:16:15.659 --> 01:16:18.781]  Final segment of the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:19.502 --> 01:16:20.463]  We're honored to be here with you.
[01:16:20.543 --> 01:16:22.945]  Owen Shroyer coming up 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:16:23.065 --> 01:16:23.826]  Sunday live.
[01:16:23.846 --> 01:16:23.886]  So.
[01:16:28.657 --> 01:16:41.100]  We have all these major universities suspending, sterilizing, and chopping children's balls off, all because of one video at a major universities them bragging about making $4,400,000 off chopping girls breast off.
[01:16:44.661 --> 01:16:45.641]  These are sickos.
[01:16:45.721 --> 01:16:46.682]  These are murderers.
[01:16:46.722 --> 01:16:47.562]  These are criminals.
[01:16:48.062 --> 01:16:49.562]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:16:51.083 --> 01:16:52.383]  Murdering children's futures.
[01:16:53.243 --> 01:16:54.003]  Mutilating them.
[01:16:54.043 --> 01:16:55.844]  I mean, a child molester just rapes a child.
[01:16:57.950 --> 01:17:02.995]  These people want to steal their future, steal their genetic imprint, their family jewels.
[01:17:04.996 --> 01:17:09.320]  Babies know they're trans once born, says Harvard Affiliated Hospital.
[01:17:10.041 --> 01:17:17.928]  A psychologist at Boston Children's Hospital, where they sterilize the kids, claims many kids know their gender seemingly from the womb.
[01:17:21.368 --> 01:17:26.235]  Baby can't talk, doesn't know who it is, but these people know it needs to be sterilized.
[01:17:26.856 --> 01:17:28.799]  Aren't they liberal?
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:37.500]   This is psychologist Carrie McGregor explains babies know they're trans once born, says Harvard Affiliated Hospital.
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:48.300]   Most of the patients that we have in the GEMS clinic actually know their gender usually around the age of puberty.
[01:17:48.532 --> 01:17:52.597]  But a good portion of children do know as early as seemingly from the womb.
[01:17:52.757 --> 01:17:57.582]  And they will usually express their gender identity as very young children, some as soon as they can talk.
[01:17:57.662 --> 01:18:01.227]  They might say phrases such as, I'm a girl, or I'm a boy, or I'm going to be.
[01:18:01.687 --> 01:18:03.609]  A woman, or I'm going to be a mom.
[01:18:03.749 --> 01:18:05.310]  Kids know very, very early.
[01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:12.797]  So in the Jones Clinic, we see a variety of young children all the way down to ages 2 and 3, and usually up to the ages of 9.
[01:18:12.897 --> 01:18:28.711]  When they come into the clinic, they'll see one of our psychologists, and we'll be talking to them about their gender, we'll be talking to their family about how to best support that child, and how to make sure that that child has the space and support to explore their gender and do well throughout their development.
[01:18:29.311 --> 01:18:31.212]  And we'll be answering any parent questions.
[01:18:31.312 --> 01:18:34.294]  A lot of parents do have questions and so we answer those questions.
[01:18:34.414 --> 01:18:41.217]  The biggest piece of advice I give parents who are coming through the gender clinic at Boston Children's Hospital is to just be supportive.
[01:18:41.978 --> 01:18:43.398]  Sometimes you might not understand.
[01:18:43.458 --> 01:18:56.084]   Sometimes you feel like you don't know the terms or you don't kind of get exactly what the child means when they say that they might be this gender but The biggest thing you can do is just love your child and support them and just allow them to express themselves.
[01:18:56.244 --> 01:19:05.748]  That's the biggest protector as well against negative mental health effects such as depression, suicidality, anxiety that we worry about for our gender diverse kids and young adults.
[01:19:06.188 --> 01:19:11.970]  So that support from a parent is one of the best protective factors and one of the best things they can do.
[01:19:12.871 --> 01:19:15.372]  Well, in my view, my opinion, that's Joseph Mingala.
[01:19:15.712 --> 01:19:17.373]  That's Joseph Mingala 3.0 right there.
[01:19:18.957 --> 01:19:22.020]  A woman with the key to your children's destiny hanging around her neck.
[01:19:23.041 --> 01:19:26.964]  And oh, you don't know what the terms are as a parent, but your newborn baby does.
[01:19:27.505 --> 01:19:35.952]  And just get out of our way and let us come in and medicalize it and screw it up and suck hundreds of thousands of dollars out of you while we sterilize your child.
[01:19:38.962 --> 01:19:48.550]  They know they can't rape a child, because everybody's against that, so we're going to rape them with hormones and chemicals and surgeries, and we're going to confuse your child at the school and say, don't you want to be a girl?
[01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:49.571]  Don't you want to be a boy?
[01:19:49.811 --> 01:19:50.692]  Don't you want to be this?
[01:19:50.892 --> 01:19:51.593]  Don't you want to be that?
[01:19:51.613 --> 01:19:57.578]  And your child gets confused and wants to tell them yes, and now, just parents, you heard her.
[01:19:58.499 --> 01:20:01.841]  Don't get involved, don't get confused, just do what your child wants.
[01:20:02.282 --> 01:20:03.523]  We're leading your child now.
[01:20:05.137 --> 01:20:13.483]  And because it's so predatory, it's so evil, it's so sick, it's so hard to believe, it's so beyond any horror movie.
[01:20:13.664 --> 01:20:15.105]  Imagine a horror movie 20 years ago.
[01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:17.106]  We're in the year 2022.
[01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:19.068]  Imagine they had a movie in 2020.
[01:20:18.927 --> 01:20:29.327]   Imagine they had a movie in 2020, or the year 2002, predicting in 2022 that they would be up there saying,
[01:20:29.327 --> 01:20:31.627]  "You don't know the terms as fine as an adult."
[01:20:31.501 --> 01:20:32.702]  Your newborn baby does.
[01:20:33.142 --> 01:20:34.383]  They're communicating with us.
[01:20:34.443 --> 01:20:35.684]  They want their balls chopped off.
[01:20:35.944 --> 01:20:37.165]  They want their penis cut off.
[01:20:37.405 --> 01:20:38.546]  They want their breasts cut off.
[01:20:38.786 --> 01:20:39.967]  They want toxic hormones.
[01:20:40.087 --> 01:20:40.547]  Okay?
[01:20:40.887 --> 01:20:42.568]  This is really liberal what we're doing.
[01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:43.369]  This is really great.
[01:20:45.387 --> 01:20:46.368]  This is eugenics.
[01:20:47.288 --> 01:20:48.329]  This is depopulation.
[01:20:48.389 --> 01:20:52.611]  They can't kill you with an abortion, or kill you with fentanyl, or kill you with depression.
[01:20:52.851 --> 01:20:58.835]  I love how she says, you know, we stop the depression and suicide by letting the hospital run it.
[01:20:58.915 --> 01:21:02.757]  No, it's the people that have these surgeries that are the highest level of suicide.
[01:21:03.577 --> 01:21:13.621]   And when people come out and say, I didn't want to be mutilated, I didn't want my breast or my testicles or my penis cut off, They get censored by big tech because they're the loving big tech.
[01:21:14.021 --> 01:21:17.983]  The same ones that will take $2,500 out of your account if you don't submit to them.
[01:21:19.724 --> 01:21:23.867]  This is a group of evil people that want to feed off children and want to hurt children, period.
[01:21:25.068 --> 01:21:28.670]  And as soon as you wake up to that and say no to that, we're on the path to victory.
[01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:31.451]  And the good news is people are waking up.
[01:21:31.492 --> 01:21:41.763]   But I mean, this evil attack is so crazy, so sick, so weird, so bizarre, The average person's like, the hospital's doing hundreds of surgeries a week, cutting little boys' penises off.
[01:21:42.384 --> 01:21:43.445]  They're cutting girls' breasts off.
[01:21:43.485 --> 01:21:44.866]  How do you even like, you're like, what?
[01:21:46.007 --> 01:21:47.629]  Listen, don't make them commit suicide.
[01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:50.030]  You're going to make them commit suicide?
[01:21:50.050 --> 01:21:51.151]  They know they're going to kill themselves.
[01:21:51.171 --> 01:21:55.715]  See, when they wake up, their balls are cut off, their penises are cut off, their breasts are cut off.
[01:21:56.015 --> 01:21:56.996]  They've been sterilized.
[01:21:57.016 --> 01:21:58.277]  They're a foot short of where they should have been.
[01:21:58.557 --> 01:21:59.438]  They're all screwed up.
[01:21:59.758 --> 01:22:02.560]  They're held by a medical cult, CIA, mind control.
[01:22:03.021 --> 01:22:03.901]  They're going to commit suicide.
[01:22:03.921 --> 01:22:09.025]  Like, don't try to save them or you're going to make them kill themselves while they are killing them.
[01:22:10.647 --> 01:22:13.009]  They don't cut their hearts out like the Aztecs did.
[01:22:13.549 --> 01:22:15.250]  They cut their testicles off.
[01:22:15.651 --> 01:22:16.832]  They cut their breasts off.
[01:22:16.872 --> 01:22:18.173]  They cut their penises off.
[01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:22.802]  And tomorrow I'm going to play all of this and get more into depth.
[01:22:22.822 --> 01:22:24.362]  Yeah, maybe we should play the clip of the young lady.
[01:22:25.623 --> 01:22:26.703]  I see you guys put it on screen.
[01:22:26.843 --> 01:22:30.064]  Because here they are arresting mothers they criticize in the UK.
[01:22:30.884 --> 01:22:32.284]  Gotta arrest those terrorists.
[01:22:32.804 --> 01:22:33.944]  Nobody can say no.
[01:22:33.964 --> 01:22:40.226]  We've got to, early on, stop those that resist so everybody else gets scared and submits to us mutilating children.
[01:22:41.106 --> 01:22:47.248]  Again, CBS News reports frames removal of gay porn books from children's libraries as book banning.
[01:22:47.268 --> 01:22:48.688]  And this guy's really upset.
[01:22:51.186 --> 01:22:54.767]  They're so upset we're passing laws saying no.
[01:22:54.807 --> 01:22:55.848]  But let's play a few minutes of this.
[01:22:56.308 --> 01:23:01.830]  Har, young girl, coerced into gender transition surgery, laments being mutilated by doctors.
[01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:08.933]  You might want to go to InfoWars.com or Sinister or everywhere else and find the video of what they did to her, cutting her breast off.
[01:23:09.733 --> 01:23:10.773]  Because they're good people!
[01:23:12.034 --> 01:23:14.475]  If Jeffrey Dahmer did it, there'd be a Netflix show about him.
[01:23:14.855 --> 01:23:19.377]  You know, if Charlie Manson did, but oh, when it's the liberal doctors.
[01:23:19.817 --> 01:23:20.437]  Here's a clip of her.
[01:23:23.809 --> 01:23:25.650]  I can't believe this happened.
[01:23:27.370 --> 01:23:29.211]  I ruined my life.
[01:23:32.332 --> 01:23:40.435]  When you break it down, I decided that I didn't want to be a woman before I had ever even experienced being a woman.
[01:23:40.335 --> 01:23:46.954]   I had no idea what being a woman was like because I was a child and now I feel like
[01:23:46.954 --> 01:23:52.954]  I will never entirely know.
[01:23:52.954 --> 01:24:02.014]   I want to say that I really feel like some people in the trans community and the trans
[01:24:02.014 --> 01:24:08.514]   medicalists and the doctors really, really target the most vulnerable of us.
[01:24:08.966 --> 01:24:16.009]  I have borderline personality disorder and I know for a fact that this is the reason for my transition.
[01:24:19.289 --> 01:24:32.456]  It's a very difficult mental illness and one of the core features is not having any sense of self or identity and my doctors knew this.
[01:24:34.297 --> 01:24:44.286]   I told them, even though they didn't ask, That I had been diagnosed with BPD and it was all fine to them.
[01:24:44.506 --> 01:24:49.747]  I wasn't happy as a girl, so that meant I was a boy and I was trans.
[01:24:49.887 --> 01:24:57.606]  And so I just took the cure that was handed to me.
[01:24:57.606 --> 01:25:08.287]  I was told that I was being given a cure.
[01:25:08.287 --> 01:25:09.047]  And I--
[01:25:09.047 --> 01:25:11.287]  Let's just stop right there.
[01:25:10.446 --> 01:25:14.228]  You know, I feel led by the Holy Spirit to do the whole show tomorrow.
[01:25:14.628 --> 01:25:17.709]  Not on World War III, not on the economy, but this human sacrifice.
[01:25:18.150 --> 01:25:19.710]  We're gonna play her, we're gonna play others.
[01:25:20.211 --> 01:25:21.111]  They cut her breast off.
[01:25:21.231 --> 01:25:22.592]  They didn't get her uterus.
[01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:25.813]  She's still a woman, and you'll find a man that loves you, sweetheart.
[01:25:25.833 --> 01:25:26.654]  You're a beautiful person.
[01:25:27.441 --> 01:25:33.923]  They get kids depressed in this sick culture, and they come and say, just cut your breast off, or cut your uterus out, and you'll be happy.
[01:25:36.725 --> 01:25:39.646]  I mean, let that sink in, that this is what goes on in America.
[01:25:40.006 --> 01:25:43.247]  If I went to the doctor and said, I want to cut my pinky finger off, they'd call a paddy wagon.
[01:25:44.298 --> 01:25:47.620]  But if I want to cut my penis off, I'm a smart, cool person.
[01:25:47.941 --> 01:25:54.505]  These are sick, satanic freaks that are tricking our children to do this, and they're going to pay for what they've done.
[01:25:54.786 --> 01:25:55.926]  But forget the evil people.
[01:25:56.207 --> 01:25:57.748]  We've got to reach out to these young people.
[01:25:57.968 --> 01:26:01.510]  We've got to build a culture and a civilization that says none of this, and we're going to stop it together.
[01:26:01.791 --> 01:26:03.672]  Tomorrow, tune in 11 a.m.
[01:26:03.712 --> 01:26:06.754]  Central, because I'm going full bore against these monsters.
[01:26:07.475 --> 01:26:11.258]  And we're going to expose what they're doing, pillar to post, tomorrow.
[01:26:12.018 --> 01:26:13.039]  Alright, Owen's taking over.
[01:26:14.815 --> 01:26:15.657]  I'm in God's hands.
[01:26:15.697 --> 01:26:16.378]  I'm committed to God.

[01:26:28.797 --> 01:26:29.417]  We'll be gone.
[01:26:29.437 --> 01:26:30.437]  It won't matter then.
[01:26:30.877 --> 01:26:32.038]  We need the help now.
[01:26:32.358 --> 01:26:34.258]  We're up against pedophile devil worshippers.

[01:27:22.232 --> 01:27:28.157]  And the most exciting part of this is we have X3 back in stock.
[01:27:29.178 --> 01:27:33.662]  So many people, the UN estimates over 2 billion, have cognitive disabilities.
[01:27:34.554 --> 01:27:37.295]  Because they have iodine deficiencies.
[01:27:37.956 --> 01:27:40.757]  And most forms of iodine are not fully absorbable.
[01:27:41.317 --> 01:27:45.780]  But we have all three of the best, healthiest, most absorbable types of iodine together.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:48.421]  That's why it's X3 in one formula.
[01:27:49.001 --> 01:27:50.042]  Now we also have X2.
[01:27:50.202 --> 01:27:50.922]  It's apples and oranges.
[01:27:50.982 --> 01:27:51.903]  It's a great formula as well.
[01:27:52.143 --> 01:27:53.584]  But it's pure deep-earth crystal.
[01:27:54.224 --> 01:28:00.403]   and is amazing. X3 is deep earth crystal with two other healthy types of iodine that your
[01:28:00.403 --> 01:28:05.724]   body absorbs. It is essential to electrochemical activity in the body, all cellular activity,
[01:28:05.724 --> 01:28:10.922]   your immune system, your stamina, your libido, your fertility. So many of the problems we
[01:28:10.922 --> 01:28:13.684]  have in the world today are because of iodine deficiency.
[01:28:13.983 --> 01:28:19.447]  Hell, until 30 years ago, the government put it in the salt, a low-quality version, but it still had some great effects.
[01:28:19.788 --> 01:28:27.534]  Many estimates are IQs, after just a few years of iodine in the salt, were boosted up to 15 points on average, 10 points.
[01:28:28.055 --> 01:28:30.398]   So, X3 Is that right?
