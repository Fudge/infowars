[00:16.000 --> 00:19.000]  Info Wars. Tomorrow's news. Today.
[00:19.000 --> 00:28.000]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star.
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Cowboys Center.
[00:44.000 --> 00:54.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:03.000 --> 01:05.000]  Alright folks, here's the deal.
[01:06.000 --> 01:09.000]  I have been working on some massive stories this morning.
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  Huge history changing developments.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  Normally I get ready for hours before the show.
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  I have not looked at any of these articles.
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.000]  I have not prepared, even though I got up at 5am and read a bunch of news then.
[01:23.000 --> 01:34.000]  I got like 10 pots going here on the stove and some of them are just devastating, devastating, devastating to the New World Order.
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.000]  And so I'm sitting here about 30 minutes ago where I'm still taking these calls and all this stuff is developing.
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  And I'm like, what am I going to do?
[01:41.000 --> 01:43.000]  I've got to get ready for the show.
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  But I've got to finish this investigation and what's happening and dot my eyes and cross my T's.
[01:50.000 --> 01:52.000]  And then I went, wait a minute.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  Dr. Peter McCullough was in studio Saturday.
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  He's got about a million views on Band-Aub, any of them.
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  And dropped just mega massive bombshells.
[02:02.000 --> 02:09.000]  He now agrees it's an inside job, a purposeful bio-weapon attack, and that 9 out of 10 dying of COVID are dying from the shots.
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.000]  That's in major studies.
[02:11.000 --> 02:14.000]  It's an incredible hour-long interview.
[02:14.000 --> 02:21.000]  And I'd already said to him, we're going to put this out Saturday as a special report, but I'm going to air it Wednesday.
[02:21.000 --> 02:23.000]  Because, you know, Monday, people are on vacation.
[02:23.000 --> 02:26.000]  Tuesday, the audience isn't as big because it's after holiday.
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.000]  I want it to be the biggest part of the week, the most important to save lives and bring the globalists to justice.
[02:31.000 --> 02:48.000]  So I'm thinking, oh, I'll just air part of that in the first hour so that I can finish the stories I'm working on and then come in here for at least 30 minutes while this Peter McCullough interview is airing and go over all this.
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  But as you can see, all these stacks over here, I've not gone through yet.
[02:53.000 --> 02:54.000]  I've got stacks over here.
[02:54.000 --> 02:55.000]  I've got stacks over here.
[02:55.000 --> 02:57.000]  This is what it looks like in the morning when I come in here.
[02:57.000 --> 03:02.000]  There's stacks waiting for me to go through them and then I go through them and it becomes this right here.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  I put the different subjects, different areas and different piles.
[03:05.000 --> 03:06.000]  So this is yesterday's news.
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  You're kind of getting a little inside baseball here.
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  I've got to clean this off.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  I've got to go finish this.
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  One of these big things I'm working on for about five minutes.
[03:14.000 --> 03:15.000]  It just couldn't.
[03:15.000 --> 03:16.000]  It was right up to the wire.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  That's why I'm wearing a regular t-shirt here, you know, not the sports jacket or anything.
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.000]  And I'm going to get reset and come in here and just knock it out of the park today.
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.000]  We've got a lot of big news to cover as well.
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  So you definitely don't want to miss this broadcast.
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.000]  Jan Ervin is going to be on the show.
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  I've been aware of his work for more than 15 years.
[03:38.000 --> 03:47.000]  And he saw me do a big report on human sacrifice and how it's tied to occult chemicals and how hallucinogens are what bring down civilizations.
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.000]  When they open up these portals, he's going to be joining us in the third hour.
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.000]  That's going to be a huge, huge interview.
[03:55.000 --> 04:03.000]  And me and Jan talked on the phone, you know, a couple times a year for many years.
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.000]  I just never got him on the show.
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.000]  I don't know why he's on in the third hour today.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  And this is going to be a big, important interview, but I got to tell you, there's a lot of stuff going on.
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  A lot of really horrible stuff and a lot of really good stuff as well.
[04:19.000 --> 04:24.000]  And so that's Newtonian physics, and it's absolutely true in the third dimension.
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  It's a law, one of God's laws.
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  For every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[04:29.000 --> 04:40.000]  So as long as we realize, while they're pounding us and attacking us, if we don't give up and let them psych us out, we just get stronger in that process, as Nietzsche said.
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  So that which does not kill me only makes you stronger.
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  And for every attack we take, bigger doors open and we're taking up levels.
[04:47.000 --> 04:53.000]  And I can tell you, Info Wars has gone up another level to the top in just the last 24 hours.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  InfoWars.com.
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.000]  Ultimate Fish Oil is back in stock at InfoWarsTour.com.
[05:05.000 --> 05:07.000]  What does ultimate mean?
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.000]  That's just our name for the best, the highest grade.
[05:11.000 --> 05:27.000]  What this concentrated anchovy oil, pure arctic krill oil, and high quality wild caught salmon oil does for your brain, your heart, your cardiovascular system, and for your entire body's functions is insane.
[05:27.000 --> 05:32.000]  Regular low grade fish oil in all the studies does outstanding things.
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  This is the highest grade.
[05:35.000 --> 05:36.000]  It's not been pasteurized.
[05:36.000 --> 05:37.000]  It's not been boiled.
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.000]  So it has its original effects intact.
[05:40.000 --> 05:49.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, everybody should visit InfoWarsTour.com today and get ultimate fish oil finally back in stock for 15% off.
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  For our regular fans and our big supporters, you're going to love it.
[05:52.000 --> 05:53.000]  You already know how great it is.
[05:53.000 --> 05:57.000]  But for folks that have been on the fence, experience ultimate fish oil for yourself.
[05:57.000 --> 06:01.000]  Try taking this up before bedtime and see what happens with your dreams.
[06:01.000 --> 06:10.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[06:10.000 --> 06:17.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:17.000 --> 06:31.000]  We're going to go to the heart of the New World Order takeover and what's really behind it, the bottom of the rabbit hole, with a very special guest author and researcher, Jan Irving, in the third hour today.
[06:31.000 --> 06:41.000]  Saturday, I taped an interview with Dr. Peter McCullough, who's the leading scientist and doctor after exposing the whole COVID power grab and the deadly shots.
[06:41.000 --> 06:47.000]  He had tried to fly in Friday to be on, but storms across the country did not let him get into Austin.
[06:47.000 --> 06:48.000]  So he flew in Saturday morning.
[06:48.000 --> 06:52.000]  We taped an hour-plus interview that's at Band-Aid video.
[06:52.000 --> 06:56.000]  But I didn't want to air it Monday or Tuesday because the audience is smaller because of the holiday.
[06:56.000 --> 06:59.000]  I told him we would air it on Wednesday.
[06:59.000 --> 07:04.000]  And so I was planning to air it coming up probably in, say, the second hour.
[07:04.000 --> 07:11.000]  But I've had some big breaking news and some things I'm working on and some big things that are developing that are going to be huge.
[07:11.000 --> 07:15.000]  And so I've been dealing with those this morning and normally get prepared for the show.
[07:15.000 --> 07:16.000]  I didn't get prepared.
[07:16.000 --> 07:17.000]  So it's perfect.
[07:17.000 --> 07:23.000]  I got a ton of stuff I'm going to cover, a ton of stuff that I need to go over and a lot of big breaking news.
[07:23.000 --> 07:29.000]  And so I'm going to air this Dr. Peter McCullough interview, or at least a large portion of it.
[07:29.000 --> 07:31.000]  You'll find all of it at Band-Aid video.
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  We're going to repost it to the live show feed section of InfoWars.com.
[07:35.000 --> 07:36.000]  You can share it there.
[07:36.000 --> 07:42.000]  Exclusive Dr. Peter McCullough issues emergency cover 19 warning confirming that it's killing people by design.
[07:42.000 --> 07:48.000]  He's so prestigious, so respected, run major FDA trials, you know, big Fox News correspondent.
[07:48.000 --> 07:52.000]  And now it's all out there in the open.
[07:52.000 --> 07:55.000]  So we're going to air large portions of this.
[07:55.000 --> 07:56.000]  So it'll just kind of go out to break.
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.000]  It'll come back in with the liners.
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  You know, it's the Alex Jones show, and then we'll play that for the rest of the hour.
[08:01.000 --> 08:06.000]  And then start your engines because I may go ahead and break this big news next hour.
[08:06.000 --> 08:10.000]  I'm not sure yet, but regardless, we're going to be hitting all the huge things that have happened.
[08:10.000 --> 08:11.000]  And it's crazy.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  So here is the Dr. Peter McCullough interview.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  Hope you share it, everybody, because this is life saving.
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  The wheels have come off the new world order.
[08:19.000 --> 08:20.000]  We've been vindicated.
[08:20.000 --> 08:21.000]  They're in deep trouble.
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.000]  But now we got to press the attack and the information war.
[08:24.000 --> 08:25.000]  And that's where you come in.
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  And that's where victory is decided in your actions.
[08:27.000 --> 08:31.000]  So share the live feed info wars dot com forward slash show and band on video.
[08:31.000 --> 08:58.000]  I know you're going to take action.
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  I don't need to tell you the world is in a great state of flux.
[09:02.000 --> 09:11.000]  Powerful forces are openly trying to establish a worldwide biomedical tyranny.
[09:11.000 --> 09:17.000]  We're honored to be joined by Dr. Peter McCullough, one of the most outspoken effective individuals
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  for medical freedom and truth.
[09:19.000 --> 09:27.000]  And he came to Austin specifically this Saturday to break huge major developments on multiple fronts.
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.000]  It's clear the official COVID narrative has collapsed.
[09:31.000 --> 09:32.000]  The rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  They're admitting the shots don't work and have serious side effects.
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.000]  There is so much to discuss.
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  And now we know more about who's censoring and why.
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  And it ties into Hunter Biden's laptop.
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  The FBI admitting that they were involved censoring it.
[09:46.000 --> 09:52.000]  Well, we now know it's the same thing, censoring doctors like Malone and McCullough and so many others.
[09:52.000 --> 10:01.000]  And he joins us here in studio, commercial free on this emergency Saturday broadcast to lay out these huge developments.
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  Doctor, thank you so much for being here.
[10:03.000 --> 10:04.000]  Thanks for having me.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  I'm going to try to give you the floor to start wherever you'd like and go through this consecutively.
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  We're going to get into the propaganda, the censorship, the wheels coming off.
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  What's coming next and so much more.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  Well, August was a busy month for news.
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  There's no doubt about it.
[10:17.000 --> 10:26.000]  Rachelle Walensky, our CDC director came out and said the CDC made large mistakes and they needed to own these mistakes.
[10:26.000 --> 10:27.000]  I was called on the news.
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  I was on Fox multiple stations.
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  They said, well, what mistakes did they make?
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.000]  And it was clear that the advice from the CDC was erratic.
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.000]  It was inconsistent, but yet it was dictatorial.
[10:39.000 --> 10:55.000]  And we know this because when we got to the point of wearing masks on airplanes, it took a federal judge in Florida to basically rule that the CDC can't tell Americans to wear masks on airplanes and have that have any traction.
[10:55.000 --> 11:03.000]  My opinion is that the CDC should have never given any advice or guidance on contagion control.
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  Contagion control is in the realm of doctors and others who look after patients.
[11:08.000 --> 11:15.000]  There was no evidence to support public masking or hand sanitizers or social distancing, none of it.
[11:15.000 --> 11:21.000]  And the CDC never should have given guidance advice on emergency use authorized vaccines.
[11:21.000 --> 11:28.000]  The CDC establishes the general childhood vaccine schedule, but they were way out of their league in both of these endeavors.
[11:28.000 --> 11:34.000]  And boy, what a disaster it was for America within just a few days of all of this.
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.000]  The CDC came out with its new guidance.
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  Basically catching up to what our current understanding was recently on a podcast.
[11:42.000 --> 11:52.000]  One of the podcasters went over one of my standard lectures called the five COVID truths and lined up the most recent CDC guidance to this, which was astonishing.
[11:52.000 --> 12:04.000]  Basically, the five COVID truths is that, you know, fundamentally with respect to testing and nasal carriage of the virus, there is no difference between a fully vaccinated and an unvaccinated individual.
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  They're indistinguishable from one another. They carry the virus at the same viral loads.
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.000]  They're equally as contagious. They get the infection with kind of an equal proclivity.
[12:14.000 --> 12:25.000]  And so we have a situation now where there is absolutely no scientific support for any form of mandate on someone taking a vaccine or a booster.
[12:25.000 --> 12:36.000]  I see these headlines out of the British Medical Journal and others that are just shocking now where headlines like nine out of 10 people that die with COVID are double or triple vaxed.
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  And we see, as you mentioned, the CDC had saying, oh, sorry, we got it wrong.
[12:40.000 --> 12:45.000]  Or we see Burke saying, oh, we knew it wasn't going to work.
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.000]  And then we see all these other statements.
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  It looks like they're trying to get ahead of more data they know is coming out.
[12:52.000 --> 13:02.000]  Absolutely. There's no doubt about it. Two papers in 2021, one by lead author Wheatley had in the title immune imprinting.
[13:02.000 --> 13:12.000]  What this means is that the vaccines were given every six months, exposing the body to the same exact obsolete antigen, the Wuhan spike protein.
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  This turned out to be an immunologic disaster.
[13:14.000 --> 13:24.000]  What happened was the body's immune system was trained in on a high exposure of this antigen in critical organs and tissues, and it was misdirected.
[13:24.000 --> 13:32.000]  So when the infection actually happened, when they frail and vulnerable, there were higher rates of hospitalization and death in the fully vaccinated.
[13:32.000 --> 13:39.000]  Now in Ontario, they have data, you know, nine out of 10 people who are dying of COVID-19 are fully vaccinated.
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  There were basically three false claims of the vaccine program.
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.000]  The first false claim was the vaccine stopped the infection. If you took the vaccine, you couldn't get it.
[13:49.000 --> 13:53.000]  That quickly eroded thousands of breakthrough cases reported through 2021.
[13:53.000 --> 13:59.000]  The CDC gave up on this in May of 2021 where they basically said, we're not going to follow breakthroughs. There's too many of them.
[13:59.000 --> 14:06.000]  The second false claim was that the vaccines basically blocked transmission.
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.000]  And Walensky had to come out in the summer of 2021 and say, listen, they don't stop transmission.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  People fully vaccinated, give it to one another.
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  It was happening during weddings, cruise boats, naval ships.
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.000]  And then the last false claim was this, Alex.
[14:20.000 --> 14:28.000]  The false claim was, well, if you take the vaccine, there's a consolation prize and that you will have a milder case or you won't be hospitalized or die.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  And there was even ridiculous memes on the internet.
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  One of them was a guy who gets COVID and he dies and he said, thank goodness I had a vaccine.
[14:35.000 --> 14:36.000]  It could have been better.
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.000]  It could have been worse.
[14:37.000 --> 14:38.000]  It could have been worse.
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.000]  Right.
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.000]  So the idea is that the vaccines never reduced hospitalization and death.
[14:43.000 --> 14:51.000]  There never was a prospective randomized trial with hospitalization and death as a primary endpoint where that was reduced by the vaccines.
[14:51.000 --> 15:01.000]  The only two interventions that reduce hospitalization and death are having the illness beforehand, natural immunity, and then early treatment.
[15:01.000 --> 15:11.000]  So there was a series of fraudulent studies that didn't account for natural immunity and early treatment claiming that the vaccinated had lower rates of hospitalization and death.
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.000]  I can tell you in my practice, if I have somebody who's fully vaccinated, they are the most fearful of COVID-19.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  They're the first ones to get early treatment, the first ones.
[15:20.000 --> 15:28.000]  And so without accounting for those variables, we had a whole series of fraudulent papers claiming that the fully vaccinated had lower rates of hospitalization and death.
[15:28.000 --> 15:48.000]  And then as you pointed out, the data poured in from Canada, the UK, Israel, Europe, South Africa, and Australia, clearly showing when they account for who's been fully vaccinated that indeed the fully vaccinated are doing far worse with COVID-19 than those who are unvaccinated.
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.000]  Wow.
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  So you talk about, obviously, we'll talk about this later.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  They admit it's a PSYOP.
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  I have them admitting it's a PSYOP.
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.000]  But what is it a PSYOP for?
[16:00.000 --> 16:09.000]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular system, for your brain, for every part of your body.
[16:09.000 --> 16:17.000]  But what I don't see being promoted is the fact that it has natural psychotropic effects.
[16:17.000 --> 16:18.000]  It certainly does for me.
[16:18.000 --> 16:24.000]  When I take a couple of these capsules an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing.
[16:24.000 --> 16:30.000]  Now, there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain.
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.000]  But I want you to experience it yourself.
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  We know it's good for your heart.
[16:35.000 --> 16:36.000]  We know it's good for your brain.
[16:36.000 --> 16:40.000]  We know it's good for your arteries and veins and your lungs and every other function in your body.
[16:40.000 --> 16:49.000]  But I want you to experience this high-grade fish oil, this ultimate fish oil at InfoWarsore.com and see what it does if you take it before bedtime.
[16:49.000 --> 16:55.000]  Ultimate fish oil, 50% off, now exclusively available at InfoWarsore.com.
[16:55.000 --> 16:56.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[16:56.000 --> 17:25.000]  You're really going to miss out if you don't get it.
[17:26.000 --> 17:52.000]  Thank you.
[17:52.000 --> 18:18.000]  Thank you.
[18:18.000 --> 18:44.000]  Thank you.
[18:44.000 --> 19:10.000]  Thank you.
[19:10.000 --> 19:36.000]  Thank you.
[19:36.000 --> 20:01.000]  Thank you.
[20:01.000 --> 20:28.000]  Thank you.
[20:28.000 --> 20:57.000]  Thank you.
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  This is such a complex reality.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  It's mind-boggling.
[21:01.000 --> 21:20.000]  You know, through August, the other bombshell was that National Elegy Immunology Infectious Disease Branch director, a division director, Anthony Fauci, who ascended to much higher levels of power than his NIH position ever granted him, announced his retirement or he's stepping down.
[21:20.000 --> 21:26.000]  Alex, I looked at his announcement on the NIH website.
[21:26.000 --> 21:34.000]  I was astonished to find, in his kind of self-congratulatory departure notice, no mention of COVID-19.
[21:34.000 --> 21:39.000]  No mention of COVID-19, his signature program.
[21:39.000 --> 21:44.000]  There's no mention of, I said this when I went on with Sebastian Gorka this week.
[21:44.000 --> 21:45.000]  Gorka nearly fell out of his chair.
[21:45.000 --> 21:46.000]  He goes, what?
[21:46.000 --> 21:49.000]  This guy, this was his super bowl of his career.
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.000]  There's no mention of it.
[21:51.000 --> 21:59.000]  And now we have the COVID-19 bivalent boosters coming in, and these really deserve explanation.
[21:59.000 --> 22:20.000]  This week, the US FDA, with no human data, relying only on the manufacturers giving animal data, or eroding data, showing an antibody rise in a mouse model
[22:20.000 --> 22:28.000]  of antibodies against a common segment of the BA4, BA5 spike protein.
[22:28.000 --> 22:32.000]  The FDA inexplicably approved this.
[22:32.000 --> 22:38.000]  Do you know the investigation on the new drug application for Pfizer was just filed on August 22nd?
[22:38.000 --> 22:39.000]  I mean, they had-
[22:39.000 --> 22:40.000]  So there's no review.
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  They're just green-lighting everything.
[22:42.000 --> 22:48.000]  This is unprecedented that they had plenty of time to do large randomized trials.
[22:48.000 --> 22:52.000]  They've been in the midst of this BA4, BA5 secondary wave for months now.
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  They had plenty of time to do randomized trials.
[22:54.000 --> 22:55.000]  They have tons of money-
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.000]  But they don't want the trials because they know the previous shots are killing people.
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.000]  Well, here's the thing.
[23:00.000 --> 23:12.000]  The very first sets of trials now have been critically analyzed by Peter Doshi at University of Maryland and Joseph Freeman down in Louisiana at LSU.
[23:12.000 --> 23:19.000]  And their conclusion in a peer-reviewed paper is even from the original trials when we actually get all the safety data and the efficacy data,
[23:19.000 --> 23:24.000]  the vaccines did more harm than good in the original randomized trials.
[23:24.000 --> 23:27.000]  Then it plays out into the public space.
[23:27.000 --> 23:32.000]  We know under court order, Pfizer had to release its dossier.
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.000]  The judge, the lawyer for the FDA tried to block this to Americans for 55 years.
[23:37.000 --> 23:44.000]  What was in that dossier is that Pfizer knew about 1,223 deaths within 90 days release of their vaccine.
[23:44.000 --> 23:45.000]  Wow.
[23:45.000 --> 23:46.000]  Unprecedented.
[23:46.000 --> 23:52.000]  This is prima facie evidence that the FDA is involved in a safety cover-up for Pfizer.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  Recently, the Moderna documents-
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  And prima facie for those that don't know means on its face.
[23:56.000 --> 24:01.000]  That's on its face when the FDA says we want to block this information.
[24:01.000 --> 24:07.000]  Families were calling Pfizer saying, my loved one just died with your vaccine.
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  Pfizer was dutifully recording all these deaths.
[24:09.000 --> 24:13.000]  They had hired hundreds of employees to man the phones as these deaths poured in.
[24:13.000 --> 24:20.000]  It's astonishing that Pfizer didn't shut it down after a handful of deaths or at least 50 deaths.
[24:20.000 --> 24:21.000]  I've chaired days-
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  I mean, they clearly knew-
[24:22.000 --> 24:23.000]  So let me ask you this.
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.000]  Why have they known it's killing people and not working?
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  Are they doubling down with this super booster?
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  Is this all just a test to see what they can get away with?
[24:31.000 --> 24:32.000]  This is crazy.
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  This is clearly a test to see what they can get away with.
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  If the FDA is going to shield them from any public outrage,
[24:38.000 --> 24:45.000]  and it's interesting, Albert Borla, the CEO of Pfizer, is going on the liberal media
[24:45.000 --> 24:51.000]  and advising Americans to take more of the conventional boosters and now the bivalent boosters.
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  No one's ever asked him a question.
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.000]  You have 1,223 deaths within 90 days on your books.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  What are you doing about that?
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  It should have been shut down.
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  And then they try to suppress it, showing the premeditated nature of it.
[25:05.000 --> 25:06.000]  Well, it's true.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  And I can tell you, their breakthrough was the World Council for Health,
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.000]  which has put out a whole variety of cautionary warnings over the last two years.
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.000]  They came out on June 11th, Alex, and they said after a pharmacovigilance report,
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.000]  they looked at VAERS, they looked at the yellow card system in the UK,
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.000]  the UDRA system in the EU, and the WHO Vigisafe.
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  There's over 40,000 certified deaths that's happened within a few days of taking these shots.
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  Millions of serious safety reports.
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  World Council for Health says pull them off the market.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  They're unsafe for human use.
[25:40.000 --> 25:41.000]  This is very important.
[25:41.000 --> 25:42.000]  This is a worldwide body.
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.000]  They represent 70 individual organizations across the world.
[25:46.000 --> 25:47.000]  World Council for Health.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  World Council for Health.
[25:49.000 --> 25:50.000]  So prestigious respective groups says pull it.
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.000]  Pull it.
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  And they put out a series of cautionary warnings saying,
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  listen, if you can't get in safety together, get them off the market.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  Here's the important point.
[25:58.000 --> 26:05.000]  Is that as Pfizer and Moderna and the other vaccine suppliers march this on,
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.000]  what's going to happen is going to be a giant finger pointing exercise in the end.
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  Pfizer's going to say, listen, the FDA never told us to pull it.
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  The FDA and the CDC are running the vaccine program.
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  The FDA and CDC are going to say, listen, as Pfizer's product,
[26:19.000 --> 26:20.000]  they had the response.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  They set it up from the beginning where nobody can take the blame.
[26:22.000 --> 26:23.000]  Right.
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  More evidence of primed meditation.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  There's no doubt about it.
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  The bivalent boosters now, this is very important.
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  So they have fundamentally, the vaccine sponsors, the CDC and the FDA,
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  are saying no more legacy boosters.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  So remember, Pfizer was 30 micrograms initially,
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.000]  second shot 30 micrograms, and then every six months 30 micrograms.
[26:45.000 --> 26:46.000]  There was no change.
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.000]  Moderna was 100 mics, 100 mics, 100 mics.
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  Now of interest, the Pfizer booster is 30 micrograms.
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  It's 15 of the original, which is obsolete,
[26:56.000 --> 27:02.000]  and then 15 micrograms of the BA4, BA5 new genetic code.
[27:02.000 --> 27:09.000]  Moderna of interest is the booster is not 100 micrograms like it used to be.
[27:09.000 --> 27:14.000]  It's a 50 microgram booster, 25 mics of original and 25 mics of Omicron.
[27:14.000 --> 27:20.000]  Here's my read on this, is they are going to get less of the super toxic original
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  Wuhan spike protein with these boosters, less.
[27:23.000 --> 27:24.000]  So they're cutting the power.
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.000]  Okay, but in the BA4, BA5, we don't know anything about a human experience
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.000]  since the human studies weren't done, but I would infer as a doctor,
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.000]  it is going to be a less toxic spike exposure since the Omicron is a milder virus.
[27:37.000 --> 27:43.000]  So I think the boosters are going to in a sense take an edge off some of the safety tension,
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  but so much of the damage has already been done.
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  Exactly, now they're putting out a weaker vaccine,
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  because I'm on a sinus acubus when I'm seeing it.
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  Wasn't the Moderna three times stronger than the Pfizer?
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.000]  Yes.
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  And now we have Moderna suing Pfizer,
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  saying basically it's a copy of their shot just weaker.
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  Now that's an interesting development.
[28:00.000 --> 28:05.000]  Moderna suing Pfizer, recall that Stéphane Bainzell,
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.000]  the billionaire CEO for Moderna,
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  previously was the CEO for Biomeru.
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  And Biomeru is the French conglomerate company that Jacques Chirac
[28:16.000 --> 28:22.000]  negotiated with the Chinese to build the biosecurity annex in Wuhan, China.
[28:22.000 --> 28:29.000]  Stéphane Bainzell orchestrated the construction of the biosecurity lab in Wuhan, China.
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  And then in 2015, he changes from Biomeru
[28:32.000 --> 28:37.000]  and joins a one-person company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Moderna.
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.000]  Stéphane Bainzell joins Moderna.
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.000]  What's the long-term planning for this virus that just accidentally shows up?
[28:44.000 --> 28:45.000]  Well, listen to this.
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  So Bainzell then joins Moderna.
[28:48.000 --> 28:52.000]  He starts working with the U.S. National Institutes of Health
[28:52.000 --> 28:57.000]  on the Moderna patent for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
[29:02.000 --> 29:04.000]  Get our great bag of it here.
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  I mean, this is from, people say,
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.000]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  That's where some of the best coffee in the world
[29:11.000 --> 29:15.000]  that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil,
[29:15.000 --> 29:16.000]  better than Guatemalan coffee.
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.000]  that, you know, the media calls communists, but really, they're just a commune.
[29:21.000 --> 29:24.000]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels,
[29:28.000 --> 29:31.000]  and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years, and the price has never gone up.
[29:31.000 --> 29:34.000]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more,
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.000]  for a pound, and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[29:37.000 --> 29:41.000]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend, from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[29:46.000 --> 29:47.000]  Yeah, I'd like that.
[29:47.000 --> 29:48.000]  Okay, do you want to believe it?
[29:48.000 --> 29:53.000]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com, and that's how we fund this operation.
[29:53.000 --> 29:55.000]  And if you don't fund us and don't want to see it, that's fine.
[30:00.000 --> 30:02.000]  Our world is so full of hype.
[30:02.000 --> 30:06.000]  We are force-fed, dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate media,
[30:06.000 --> 30:09.000]  by the controlled churches and the universities.
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  And why is this the case?
[30:11.000 --> 30:15.000]  Because we innately, by God, have been given the keys for our own minds,
[30:15.000 --> 30:17.000]  our own psyche, our own souls.
[30:17.000 --> 30:20.000]  And by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves
[30:20.000 --> 30:25.000]  and transcend the quote, fallen or sinful state.
[30:25.000 --> 30:29.000]  So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we've got to bring into our bodies
[30:29.000 --> 30:33.000]  to change who we are are only lowering us.
[30:33.000 --> 30:35.000]  They're only making us more depressed.
[30:35.000 --> 30:37.000]  In the end, they're only making us less filled.
[30:37.000 --> 30:41.000]  It is only by going within and really making that connection to God
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  that we can truly empower ourselves.
[30:43.000 --> 30:46.000]  That's why the globe was bombarded with toxins and chemicals
[30:46.000 --> 30:49.000]  to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals
[30:49.000 --> 30:52.000]  and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy
[30:52.000 --> 30:56.000]  and to be able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[30:56.000 --> 30:59.000]  And that's where the incredible products come in at mforestore.com.
[31:36.000 --> 31:40.000]  We are now number nine in the world.
[31:40.000 --> 31:43.000]  This is major. This is political.
[31:43.000 --> 31:46.000]  This could fund our war chest. Just go to Amazon.com, everybody.

[31:56.000 --> 31:58.000]  It's going to go to number one. What do you make of that?
[32:02.000 --> 32:06.000]  Sold out for more than a year and a half because of supply chain breakdowns.

[32:59.000 --> 33:08.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:32.000 --> 33:35.000]  People overuse the term game changing.
[33:35.000 --> 33:40.000]  But Dr. Peter McCullough is a leading scientist who's run major FDA trials,
[33:40.000 --> 33:47.000]  respected cardiologist, and out of all the great doctors and scientists speaking out against the COVID takeover fraud,
[33:47.000 --> 33:54.000]  he is undoubtedly the most prominent, only maybe equal by Dr. Malone.
[33:54.000 --> 33:59.000]  And now he says, yes, it's an inside job, totally staged, they're murdering people on purpose,
[33:59.000 --> 34:01.000]  he has a lot of courage, he's showing the truth.
[34:01.000 --> 34:06.000]  The exclusive interview is at band.video, but I wanted to air parts of it here today.
[34:06.000 --> 34:10.000]  We'll air a little bit more of it, then I'll come back next segment with all the huge developments
[34:10.000 --> 34:14.000]  as the globalists publicly bring in the great reset, the next phase of the lockdowns,
[34:14.000 --> 34:16.000]  cutting your power off, it's happening now.
[34:16.000 --> 34:19.000]  The Austin Bergstrom Airport is still without power as we speak.
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.000]  Parts of Austin are without power, they're turning the power off in California and claiming it's climate change.
[34:24.000 --> 34:31.000]  We'll explain it all coming up, but here is more of the exclusive groundbreaking game changing interview with Dr. Peter McCullough.
[34:31.000 --> 34:39.000]  So within a few days of announcing it's an emergency under former President Trump, Madonna announces we have a vaccine.
[34:39.000 --> 34:44.000]  You don't come up with a vaccine in a few days, this vaccine was in the works for years.
[34:44.000 --> 34:50.000]  And in Peter Bragan's book, COVID-19 and the Global Predators, it's a very, very important book.
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.000]  It has over 1100 citations in the back as a timeline, Alex.
[34:54.000 --> 35:03.000]  And the timeline has 36 pandemic planning preparedness events that Bragan chronicles starting from 2012.
[35:03.000 --> 35:09.000]  25 of these have written documents generated and six of them were filmed.
[35:09.000 --> 35:18.000]  So Bragan outlines the timeline in our book COVID-19 and the Courage to Face COVID-19 that I wrote with John Leigh.
[35:18.000 --> 35:23.000]  We actually highlight these developments as well and put it in the context of a story.
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.000]  I recently went on with Steve Bannon on the war room and Bannon said,
[35:27.000 --> 35:34.000]  thank goodness that you guys wrote these books and have these citations in the timeline as evidence.
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.000]  And the reason why this is so important, Bannon is going to predict
[35:38.000 --> 35:45.000]  that what looks like a U.S. government operation, Alex, they're going to basically wipe the electronics completely.
[35:45.000 --> 35:49.000]  They are going to basically whitewash this. They are going to rewrite history.
[35:49.000 --> 35:54.000]  That the only way we're going to actually be able to record what happened is in these books
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  because the electronics, Twitter, Facebook, all the electronic media.
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  Oh, they're going back and scrubbing everything.
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.000]  It's going to be scrubbed.
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.000]  So the books and the independent media and the documentaries are going to save us.
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  We're not going to have a historical record.
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.000]  And what you're saying is I think the most important part of this interview,
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  which all of its bombshell, all of its admitted, you're totally vindicated.
[36:16.000 --> 36:17.000]  We're vindicated.
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.000]  And it's not about tooting our horn, but it's about we were faithful.
[36:20.000 --> 36:21.000]  We were right.
[36:21.000 --> 36:22.000]  We stuck our necks out.
[36:22.000 --> 36:23.000]  We were correct.
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.000]  We need to speak to that so people understand the good guys are being censored.
[36:26.000 --> 36:27.000]  We're still being attacked.
[36:27.000 --> 36:28.000]  He's being sued.
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  I'm being sued, which is fine because we're in the arena here.
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  But let's speak to the vindication how big this is.
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.000]  And then if you've, I know you've got a lot of points about the virus and what's coming next.
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  And I want you to be able to lead this doctor.
[36:40.000 --> 36:41.000]  You're doing a great job.
[36:41.000 --> 36:44.000]  But then you mentioned to me, Hey, this is a Psyop.
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.000]  Now we know the group suppressing you is connected to the Pentagon and the FBI and others.
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  I'm like, well, yeah, here's, here's the Canadian news.
[36:52.000 --> 36:59.000]  You know, here's, here's the BBC admitting that the military, not our average military,
[36:59.000 --> 37:06.000]  people running it are involved in Psyops and quote brainwashing and mind control is the
[37:06.000 --> 37:07.000]  London telegraph headline.
[37:07.000 --> 37:14.000]  I want to get guys we can to create fear and cause the lockdowns and terrorize people into
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.000]  the mass psychosis formation or mass formation to go along with this because that's what this
[37:19.000 --> 37:20.000]  is.
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  And they're, they're obviously preparing something new.
[37:22.000 --> 37:23.000]  So we've got to get ahead of this.
[37:23.000 --> 37:27.000]  Just as Governor Sanders said last week on Fox, he said, we got to break this thing's back.
[37:27.000 --> 37:28.000]  We've got to have a reckoning.
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  We've got to expose people who did this.
[37:30.000 --> 37:31.000]  We're going to do it again.
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  So it's so good to see that the Sanis really gets it.
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  I wish Trump would go all the way as well.
[37:35.000 --> 37:36.000]  There it is.
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  Use of fear to control behavior and COVID crisis was a talentarian admit scientist.
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.000]  They used military grade Psyops run by the British Ministry of Defense to terrorize Britain's
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  and others in the UK into submission.
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.000]  Same headlines out of the US, same headlines out of Canada.
[37:52.000 --> 37:55.000]  So when we say this is a Psyop, they admitted this.
[37:55.000 --> 38:00.000]  That's true. And my co-author, John Lake, a true crime author also believes it's a Psyop.
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  And, you know, you had Matthias Desmond on the show.
[38:04.000 --> 38:05.000]  Yes.
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.000]  Psychology of talentarianism.
[38:06.000 --> 38:07.000]  Yeah.
[38:07.000 --> 38:08.000]  Psychology of totalitarianism.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  I've read the book cover to cover.
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  He's a brilliant psychologist.
[38:12.000 --> 38:13.000]  This is his line of work.
[38:13.000 --> 38:19.000]  This type of group thing fell into these mass religious suicides, Nazi Germany, you know,
[38:19.000 --> 38:20.000]  how Nazism spread across.
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  I mean, this is a cult.
[38:22.000 --> 38:23.000]  Yes.
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  It's a way of thinking.
[38:24.000 --> 38:27.000]  Peter Bregan, who you've had on the show, he's a psychiatrist.
[38:27.000 --> 38:28.000]  And I want him back on, by the way.
[38:28.000 --> 38:29.000]  He's amazing.
[38:29.000 --> 38:35.000]  So the positioning of both of these great minds is that Matthias Desmond has taken the
[38:35.000 --> 38:36.000]  part of this.
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  How does this organically happen?
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.000]  How does this happen on the human mind?
[38:42.000 --> 38:48.000]  And what Bregan outlines and what John Leake in my book outlines is this is intentional.
[38:48.000 --> 38:55.000]  So it's intentional use of psychological operations to create this psychofenomenon that's actually
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  happened in people's minds that Desmond has pointed out.
[38:58.000 --> 39:03.000]  Let me show you on my screen how the science relates here.
[39:03.000 --> 39:04.000]  There are papers.
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  Now this is in the peer-reviewed literature.
[39:06.000 --> 39:11.000]  2015, first author is Venet Menacheri, senior author is Ralph Barrick.
[39:11.000 --> 39:12.000]  I have him highlighted here.
[39:12.000 --> 39:20.000]  You can see here American names and there's one Chinese name in this whole list of authors
[39:20.000 --> 39:29.000]  and it is in the next paper I'll show it to you, Dr. Shingling Li.
[39:29.000 --> 39:34.000]  But as much as we hate the chai comms, when they say this is an American made virus.
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.000]  But look at, here's University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.000]  There's an institute in Switzerland and Harvard.
[39:42.000 --> 39:50.000]  The title of the paper, SARS-like Wuhan Institute of Virology I, Poised for Human Emergence,
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.000]  published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  This is a controversy in 2015.
[39:55.000 --> 39:56.000]  It's not like this is a secret.
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.000]  This is not a secret.
[39:57.000 --> 40:02.000]  And in the paper, it says right here in the significance, together the study indicates
[40:02.000 --> 40:08.000]  an ongoing threat poised by the Wuhan Institute of Virology I related viruses
[40:08.000 --> 40:11.000]  and the need for continued study and surveillance.
[40:11.000 --> 40:17.000]  So they're saying the viruses we've made at this lab endanger the world in a high-level paper.
[40:17.000 --> 40:20.000]  Yes, in 2015.
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  We don't need to depose people in front of the Senate.
[40:24.000 --> 40:25.000]  You just read the papers.
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  This one in Nature Medicine.
[40:27.000 --> 40:30.000]  That's why it's so crazy when Fauci says, I don't even know what the end function is.
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.000]  Right. This work is funded by the National Institutes of Health.
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  It indicates that the National Institutes of Health has approved this.
[40:37.000 --> 40:40.000]  Again, Vanneet Minnicherry is working for Ralph Berick.
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  Ralph Berick, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
[40:42.000 --> 40:43.000]  I interrupted you.
[40:43.000 --> 40:44.000]  So start over.
[40:44.000 --> 40:45.000]  I think this is so huge.
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  This is the smoking gun.
[40:47.000 --> 40:48.000]  Exactly.
[40:48.000 --> 40:51.000]  These papers have been out here since 2015 in the best journal.
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.000]  Start over from the beginning.
[40:52.000 --> 40:53.000]  Go back to two minutes ago.
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  I interrupted.
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.000]  The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  And Ralph Berick is the senior author.
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.000]  His first paper on coronaviruses was in 1997.
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  This is his life of work.
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  He's been the quietest person in the last two years.
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.000]  His co-author, Vanneet Minnicherry, in two papers leads the team.
[41:13.000 --> 41:20.000]  The team is University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Harvard, an institute in Switzerland,
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.000]  and the Wuhan Institute of Biology.
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.000]  And Jiang Ling Li Shi is the Bat Lady.
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.000]  Okay.
[41:28.000 --> 41:33.000]  Notice that these are all American authors, one or two Chinese authors.
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  This is an American project.
[41:35.000 --> 41:41.000]  They need the Chinese lab to do it because they have the technology and they have the bats.
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.000]  But this is done here.
[41:42.000 --> 41:43.000]  Look at the title of the paper.
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.000]  A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence.
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  What did they do in these papers?
[41:50.000 --> 41:56.000]  They actually made a humanized respiratory epithelium in a rodent and they kept tweaking
[41:56.000 --> 42:02.000]  the spike protein in order to get it to invade a human respiratory epithelium.
[42:02.000 --> 42:03.000]  They're weaponizing.
[42:03.000 --> 42:06.000]  Now, at the same time, they're working on an answer.
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  They were working on a killed vaccine and they were working on monoclonal antibodies.
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.000]  So they can be the savior.
[42:11.000 --> 42:17.000]  Well, listen, we have biological operations through the NIH.
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.000]  It's BARDA is the unit and through the military, it's DARPA.
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  They work on a threat and they work on an answer.
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  We've had a smallpox-monkeypox program.
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  After SARS, there's obviously was a SARS program.
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  There's been an anthrax program.
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  That's the thing Gates can't shut his mouth.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  A year before, he starts ordering the monkeypox vaccine.
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.000]  He says it's coming and right on time it rolls out.
[42:37.000 --> 42:38.000]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[42:38.000 --> 42:39.000]  It's true.
[42:39.000 --> 42:40.000]  Now, look at this abstract.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  Look at one of the conclusions.
[42:42.000 --> 42:47.000]  Both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from infection
[42:47.000 --> 42:51.000]  of the coronaviruses using the novel spike protein.
[42:51.000 --> 42:52.000]  So they...
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  Folks, we'll be back.
[42:53.000 --> 42:54.000]  You've got to stay with us.
[42:54.000 --> 43:23.000]  We just get more powerful.
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  And of course, we've got boomers like you.
[43:26.000 --> 43:29.000]  So you've got to remember, we're here for those very important reasons.
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  And we're here to mmw.
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.000]  We're here for those very important reasons.
[43:34.000 --> 43:37.000]  We're here to be able to understand this and knowing this.
[43:37.000 --> 43:40.000]  So it's a very important situation with inflation.
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  And all the things out there hurting everybody.
[43:42.000 --> 43:45.000]  To be able to do things tax-wise, it's legal and lawful,
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  that allows you to keep more your money.
[43:47.000 --> 43:53.000]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.940]  3-3-900-4-2-8-5.
[44:32.920 --> 44:39.840]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[44:39.840 --> 44:44.440]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[44:44.440 --> 44:50.200]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[44:50.200 --> 44:53.040]  facts that pertain to reality.
[44:53.040 --> 44:58.280]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[44:58.280 --> 45:05.600]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda, and with spiritual warfare, and with poisons
[45:05.600 --> 45:08.480]  and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out.
[45:08.480 --> 45:12.080]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of
[45:12.080 --> 45:15.080]  God, the Creator, and we are powerful.
[45:15.080 --> 45:18.360]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[45:18.360 --> 45:22.760]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[45:22.760 --> 45:26.560]  with the boy is it true.
[45:26.560 --> 45:32.400]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[45:32.400 --> 45:36.200]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[45:36.200 --> 45:42.880]  death because they know we are strong, and they know in the end they signed on the God
[45:42.880 --> 45:44.680]  of this world who is a loser.
[45:44.680 --> 45:48.880]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep Infowars in the air now more than ever.
[45:48.880 --> 45:53.000]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting
[45:53.000 --> 45:57.800]  up is safe and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they
[45:57.800 --> 45:59.400]  just announced.
[45:59.400 --> 46:03.560]  The eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans.
[46:03.560 --> 46:09.120]  They financed major universities, they ran full page stories, and advertisements pushing
[46:09.120 --> 46:13.720]  their propaganda of New York Times, other major newspapers, that the family as we know
[46:13.720 --> 46:16.280]  it is a bad thing and must be ended.
[46:16.280 --> 46:21.880]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that
[46:21.880 --> 46:25.880]  cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[46:25.880 --> 46:30.840]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four natural daughter.
[46:30.840 --> 46:34.880]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well, I love to make breakfast.
[46:34.880 --> 46:39.040]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be
[46:39.040 --> 46:43.920]  nurtured, and then all sit down together and have the communal event.
[46:43.920 --> 46:49.440]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions
[46:49.440 --> 46:50.440]  are coming together.
[46:50.440 --> 46:51.440]  They really are.
[46:51.440 --> 46:56.880]  Sick, evil, scientific cult of filth and want to domesticate us and turn us into lab rats.
[46:56.880 --> 47:00.840]  We cannot let this continue.
[47:00.840 --> 47:28.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:54.440 --> 47:55.960]  right on time and rolls out.
[47:55.960 --> 47:57.440]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[47:57.440 --> 47:58.440]  It's true.
[47:58.440 --> 48:04.120]  And this abstract look at one of the conclusions, both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches
[48:04.120 --> 48:10.000]  fail to neutralize and protect from infection of the coronaviruses using the novel spike
[48:10.000 --> 48:11.000]  protein.
[48:11.000 --> 48:16.080]  So they had already juiced the spike protein that they knew a vaccine, at least a killed
[48:16.080 --> 48:19.800]  vaccine wasn't going to cover that ultimately became the Sinopharm coronavirus vaccine.
[48:19.800 --> 48:23.400]  And at least the first version of monoclonal antibodies didn't take it.
[48:23.400 --> 48:28.440]  It's right here in the abstract in nature of medicine in 2015.
[48:28.440 --> 48:36.080]  I can tell you this is prima facie evidence that it's a U.S. government academic program
[48:36.080 --> 48:37.480]  that's gone bad.
[48:37.480 --> 48:41.840]  And boy have Americans, you know, 10 million Americans were hospitalized with this a million
[48:41.840 --> 48:44.920]  people have lost their lives in our country from a U.S. operation.
[48:44.920 --> 48:48.520]  I mean, I lost friends and I might almost killed some of my family.
[48:48.520 --> 48:49.520]  I'm pissed.
[48:49.520 --> 48:51.840]  I mean, we are literally victims of a bio weapon attack.
[48:51.840 --> 48:57.160]  And, you know, there are now three papers, one by Farkas and colleagues published in
[48:57.160 --> 49:02.440]  military medicine and two by Yen that have concluded it's a bio weapon.
[49:02.440 --> 49:04.240]  This isn't a controversy.
[49:04.240 --> 49:05.760]  This is concluded in the academic.
[49:05.760 --> 49:10.440]  And again, we're not like liberals that want to be professional victims, but I lost friends.
[49:10.440 --> 49:11.680]  My family almost died.
[49:11.680 --> 49:12.840]  This stuff scared me.
[49:12.840 --> 49:15.440]  I barely stopped my wife from going to the hospital because she couldn't breathe.
[49:15.440 --> 49:18.560]  And they put on a ventilator and we took the steroids and she got out of it and I've
[49:18.560 --> 49:22.880]  never met him, we've been attacked, folks, we need to take it personal and bring these
[49:22.880 --> 49:25.400]  people to justice or they're going to do it again.
[49:25.400 --> 49:31.160]  But we, every one of the world is as particular to the West is a victim of a, I believe, premeditated
[49:31.160 --> 49:34.840]  release of a bio weapon attack and then phase two of the poison shot to erase our immune
[49:34.840 --> 49:35.840]  system.
[49:35.840 --> 49:41.680]  And I think we should all literally start a whole organization of victims of the of the
[49:41.680 --> 49:43.840]  of this bio attack because this is a big deal.
[49:43.840 --> 49:46.360]  Well, let's get into phase two.
[49:46.360 --> 49:48.760]  Remember, there's been two waves of injury.
[49:48.760 --> 49:53.200]  First was SARS-CoV-1, largely the wild type alpha and delta outbreaks.
[49:53.200 --> 49:57.440]  The Omicron outbreak was a very, very low hospitalization and death rates.
[49:57.440 --> 50:04.120]  In fact, Omicron, which one can get is indistinguishable from the common cold.
[50:04.120 --> 50:07.920]  But people did lose their lives with these first multiple outbreaks.
[50:07.920 --> 50:14.920]  Now the vaccine program has been cooking along and I can tell you that the vaccine itself
[50:14.920 --> 50:22.600]  has created a wave of a destruction in our country, injuries, disabilities and deaths.
[50:22.600 --> 50:27.080]  One of the breakthrough observations has come by Sasha Ladipova, show my screen.
[50:27.080 --> 50:34.560]  And in this report from trial site news, which is a valid late breaking science website
[50:34.560 --> 50:37.920]  actually supported by pharma and a lot of other sponsors.
[50:37.920 --> 50:44.280]  The title of the paper is hot lots of COVID-19 vaccines evidence of different formulations.
[50:44.280 --> 50:51.840]  And these are statistical analyses of Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson and also compared
[50:51.840 --> 50:53.560]  against the flu.
[50:53.560 --> 50:58.360]  Interestingly, Alex, when there is a complication from a flu shot, it's randomly distributed
[50:58.360 --> 51:00.880]  across all the manufacturing lots.
[51:00.880 --> 51:08.200]  But with the COVID-19 vaccines, the complications are restricted to certain lots, certain lots.
[51:08.200 --> 51:15.360]  Now recently on Steve Kersh's substack, Steve has got the European medicine agency release
[51:15.360 --> 51:23.000]  from the vaccine manufacturers showing market degradation of messenger RNA in these products.
[51:23.000 --> 51:27.000]  So remember how they had to be supercooled and in the randomized trials they used single
[51:27.000 --> 51:28.000]  use files.
[51:28.000 --> 51:29.000]  And then suddenly they didn't anymore.
[51:29.000 --> 51:30.000]  Right.
[51:30.000 --> 51:31.400]  So it wasn't supercooled anymore.
[51:31.400 --> 51:33.160]  They were using multi-use files.
[51:33.160 --> 51:38.200]  The leading thinking, believe it or not, is the majority of people who get the shots and
[51:38.200 --> 51:41.040]  are fine, they're actually getting degraded messenger RNA.
[51:41.040 --> 51:42.960]  They're actually not getting much of a genetic insight.
[51:42.960 --> 51:45.560]  So think, they've been a lot worse than they hadn't.
[51:45.560 --> 51:46.560]  Right.
[51:46.560 --> 51:48.560]  So the lots are causing damage in the latter COVID.
[51:48.560 --> 51:49.960]  You don't want a fresh shot.
[51:49.960 --> 51:50.960]  Well here's the thing.
[51:50.960 --> 51:51.960]  Yeah, exactly.
[51:51.960 --> 51:56.760]  Believe it or not, if you actually get the messenger RNA as designed and the spike protein
[51:56.760 --> 52:01.560]  production as designed, it can be and in many cases is lethal.
[52:01.560 --> 52:07.560]  So it's actually sloppy manufacturing and product handling that's saving Americans.
[52:07.560 --> 52:12.560]  You know, a recent Zogby survey, Zogby is a very good survey operation in the United
[52:12.560 --> 52:13.560]  States.
[52:13.560 --> 52:18.280]  Zogby surveyed a large number of Americans and asked them, what'd you do?
[52:18.280 --> 52:19.880]  Two thirds of people took the vaccines.
[52:19.880 --> 52:25.000]  Of interest, Alex, 85% say, I took the vaccine and I'm fine.
[52:25.000 --> 52:26.000]  Nothing happened.
[52:26.000 --> 52:27.000]  I took the vaccine and I'm fine.
[52:27.000 --> 52:28.000]  That's because they got spoiled.
[52:28.000 --> 52:29.000]  Probably.
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.120]  15% said, I've got a problem.
[52:31.120 --> 52:32.360]  I've got a new disease.
[52:32.360 --> 52:33.560]  I've got a new medical problem.
[52:33.560 --> 52:38.520]  I'm going to my doctor and they fall into cardiovascular, neurological, hematological,
[52:38.520 --> 52:41.960]  immunological and now unfortunately cancer.
[52:41.960 --> 52:44.360]  And that's the current state of affairs.
[52:44.360 --> 52:50.600]  15% of Americans who have taken these products now, I think, deeply regret it.
[52:50.600 --> 52:55.600]  Well, Gregory said a great report six months ago that got millions of years and went viral
[52:55.600 --> 52:58.640]  where he showed the VAERS reports as well as other reports and other, I think some of
[52:58.640 --> 53:03.120]  our curses research and others showing that it looked like red states in areas were having
[53:03.120 --> 53:04.720]  higher death rates.
[53:04.720 --> 53:08.920]  But now with this, it just looks like the blue states are so sloppy and so lazy and
[53:08.920 --> 53:15.240]  so bad about deploying things that they were giving people old spoiled ones.
[53:15.240 --> 53:18.320]  But the more conservative states were actually better at deploying it.
[53:18.320 --> 53:23.320]  So that's probably why it's the more conservative areas being hit and having higher death rates.
[53:23.320 --> 53:25.120]  I mean, that's not scientific.
[53:25.120 --> 53:27.640]  I'm just trying to guess that could be why.
[53:27.640 --> 53:34.580]  If you looked at blue states that are potentially more heavily vaccinated, then there was actually
[53:34.580 --> 53:39.040]  probably a greater free for all, if you will, at CVS and Walgreens.
[53:39.040 --> 53:41.880]  They left the vials out, multiple people coming in.
[53:41.880 --> 53:45.120]  So as soon as you leave a vial out and starts to get warmer, there's multiple needle pokes
[53:45.120 --> 53:49.320]  through the diaphragm of the vial, then there's introduction of oxygen and oxidative stress,
[53:49.320 --> 53:50.320]  whatever.
[53:50.320 --> 53:55.080]  And if you go to states where there's infrequent vaccination, in theory, you probably didn't
[53:55.080 --> 54:00.120]  take it out of the fridge that much and maybe used it once and got a good shot.
[54:00.120 --> 54:01.880]  Because I don't know, because the numbers are there.
[54:01.880 --> 54:05.560]  Why were red areas higher death rates from the shot?
[54:05.560 --> 54:08.440]  And I can never figure it out, but it just sounds like there's just a little left.
[54:08.440 --> 54:10.880]  It's just so incompetent, so sloppy.
[54:10.880 --> 54:15.520]  It's almost like a gift to themselves, because even though they're a higher vaccination rate,
[54:15.520 --> 54:16.520]  the numbers have changed.
[54:16.520 --> 54:17.720]  But I mean, it's crazy.
[54:17.720 --> 54:18.720]  Yeah.
[54:18.720 --> 54:19.720]  There's no doubt about it.
[54:19.720 --> 54:22.160]  But the point is, it's not randomly distributed.
[54:22.160 --> 54:23.840]  Senator Ron Johnson, myself, Robert...
[54:23.840 --> 54:26.120]  Yeah, why are certain lots at certain places?
[54:26.120 --> 54:27.120]  That was...
[54:27.120 --> 54:28.120]  Exclusive.
[54:28.120 --> 54:31.600]  Dr. Peter McCullough issues emergency COVID-19 warning.
[54:31.600 --> 54:36.960]  It's at man.video, it's at infowars.com, and we just screamed out about two-thirds of the
[54:36.960 --> 54:37.960]  interview.
[54:37.960 --> 54:41.560]  The rest of the interview, if you want to see it and share it, hopefully, is at man.video.
[54:41.560 --> 54:42.560]  Okay.
[54:42.560 --> 54:48.240]  I was already planning to air this interview today, but I was going to do it later.
[54:48.240 --> 54:51.440]  Because I got behind with a bunch of big stuff we're doing behind the scenes, I've now had
[54:51.440 --> 54:56.200]  a chance to go over all the news that I had sent to the crew and has already been researching
[54:56.200 --> 54:57.680]  and I want to get into.
[54:57.680 --> 55:03.560]  And it is unbelievably clear that they are cutting the energy off around the country
[55:03.560 --> 55:08.360]  on purpose to train you to live in a post-industrial world, and we have all the proof.
[55:08.360 --> 55:13.760]  And the good news is, this information gets out, it's over for the globalist, and the
[55:13.760 --> 55:17.040]  power companies that they've quietly come in and taken control of.
[55:17.040 --> 55:20.320]  But it's not even the power generation companies that are the bad guys.
[55:20.320 --> 55:25.720]  It's the management companies like ERCOT in Texas and INRON that was in California that
[55:25.720 --> 55:27.040]  got caught right in the scams.
[55:27.040 --> 55:33.000]  And this is all INRON 2.0, so that's coming up at the start of the next hour.
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.480]  It is so critical, Austin Airport still without power, climate change overwhelming California
[55:38.480 --> 55:39.480]  power grid.
[55:39.480 --> 55:42.320]  No, they cut the power grid off, now they don't have enough power.
[55:42.320 --> 55:47.960]  No, but don't worry, Swiss face up to three years in prison for violating heating rules
[55:47.960 --> 55:51.560]  if they try to change the smart meter in their house.
[55:51.560 --> 55:55.400]  So you can see how they're a few years ahead of us here in the U.S. where they're now taking
[55:55.400 --> 55:57.000]  control of the smart meter.
[55:57.000 --> 56:02.160]  Sugar Carlson gets it and says the elites are making things worse on purpose, exactly.
[56:02.160 --> 56:06.040]  And as soon as the public gets that, it's game over for the new world order.
[56:06.040 --> 56:08.880]  But let me make a really exciting announcement.
[56:08.880 --> 56:13.560]  We got a very small shipment of diet force that's got a bunch of natural compounds to
[56:13.560 --> 56:16.080]  speed up your metabolism naturally in a healthy way.
[56:16.080 --> 56:19.000]  It's sold out very quickly, we're getting rave reviews for it.
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.160]  We got a big shipment of diet force in to infowarstore.com, for those of you that have
[56:23.160 --> 56:28.600]  been wanting it the last month that's been sold out, it is now 40% off infowarstore.com.
[56:28.600 --> 56:29.840]  And here's the really big announcement.
[56:29.840 --> 56:34.040]  We only got this in one time a year and a half ago, people loved it, highest quality concentrated
[56:34.040 --> 56:40.560]  greens from wheatgrass and just so much more, it is the top of the line greens for your
[56:40.560 --> 56:43.520]  body, for your immune system, your whole body.
[56:43.520 --> 56:49.520]  This fiber capsules, it was organic, concentrates, it's now back in stock and it is massively
[56:49.520 --> 56:52.400]  discounted at infowarstore.com.
[56:52.400 --> 56:54.600]  And guess what else is back?
[56:54.600 --> 57:01.080]  Brain force plus, the good, clean, powerful, long lasting, neutropic, back in stock, it
[57:01.080 --> 57:04.800]  ladies and gentlemen, is 50% off as well.
[57:04.800 --> 57:09.000]  And then we have brain force ultra that acts really quick and I love it because it dissipates
[57:09.000 --> 57:10.000]  in three, four hours.
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.480]  Whereas turbo force last 10 hours and brain force plus last five, six hours.
[57:14.480 --> 57:16.920]  This lasts about two and a half hours, three hours average person.
[57:16.920 --> 57:20.600]  You got to go out to dinner, you're tired, boom, a squirt of this, still go to sleep
[57:20.600 --> 57:23.440]  three hours later, great, but it hits in like 15 minutes.
[57:23.440 --> 57:25.880]  This is really a special formula.
[57:25.880 --> 57:33.880]  It is back in stock, brain force ultra infowarstore.com, or triple eight, two, five, three, three,
[57:33.880 --> 57:38.280]  one, three, nine, diet force back in stock, 40% off.
[57:38.280 --> 57:42.080]  Green fiber caps back in stock, 50% off.
[57:42.080 --> 57:43.080]  And so much more.
[57:43.080 --> 57:44.080]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[57:44.080 --> 57:45.320]  We'll be right back.
[57:45.320 --> 57:52.640]  People ask me all the time, what is your best new tropic?
[57:52.640 --> 57:58.280]  You've got turbo force, you've got brain force plus, and you've got brain force ultra.
[57:58.280 --> 57:59.880]  Which one is better?
[57:59.880 --> 58:08.760]  And that's like asking what's better, a Ford F 150 or a Cadillac or a Ferrari.
[58:08.760 --> 58:10.760]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[58:10.760 --> 58:16.120]  It varies all three are different formulas, all three do different things.
[58:16.120 --> 58:20.200]  Turbo force is 10 hours of clean out of control energy.
[58:20.200 --> 58:22.960]  I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[58:22.960 --> 58:26.960]  Brain force plus is a long term acting clean new tropic.
[58:26.960 --> 58:34.000]  This brain force ultra is a super fast acting new tropic that creates incredible clarity
[58:34.000 --> 58:35.600]  but doesn't last very long.
[58:35.600 --> 58:37.520]  They're all three different formulas.
[58:37.520 --> 58:44.880]  And finally, back in stock, massively discounted, brain force ultra is available at infowarstore.com.
[58:44.880 --> 58:49.280]  Brain force ultra back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[58:49.280 --> 58:55.480]  We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what
[58:55.480 --> 58:57.840]  we've known and what's to come.
[58:57.840 --> 59:03.120]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is don't panic.
[59:03.120 --> 59:08.440]  Stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto
[59:08.440 --> 59:10.680]  a safe sound course.
[59:10.680 --> 59:16.400]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building our own
[59:16.400 --> 59:17.520]  society.
[59:17.520 --> 59:23.120]  All we got to do is survive the crash and right now we still have time to prepare.
[59:23.120 --> 59:27.400]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[59:27.400 --> 59:33.720]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water and survival gear to
[59:33.720 --> 59:36.160]  keep us strong and at the ready.
[59:36.160 --> 59:43.840]  Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials, storable foods, water filtration, first aid,
[59:43.840 --> 59:56.640]  power and more at preparedtoday.com.
[1:00:23.480 --> 1:00:28.520]  Just how much of the great reset has already dug its blood-soaked talents into modern
[1:00:28.520 --> 1:00:29.520]  civilization?
[1:00:29.520 --> 1:00:42.800]  I've got a message for all illegals, if you don't want to be pushed back, if you don't
[1:00:42.800 --> 1:00:47.720]  want to be arrested, if you don't want to be shot, don't come to our borders.
[1:00:47.720 --> 1:00:49.880]  Do not come to the Polish border.
[1:00:49.880 --> 1:00:50.880]  Then you're safe.
[1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:51.880]  It's not us.
[1:00:51.880 --> 1:00:56.640]  It's not our police who came up to beat you up, to push you or to arrest you.
[1:00:56.640 --> 1:00:59.600]  It's you who tried to break the law on our land.
[1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:05.200]  Even though churches, gyms, schools, weddings, funerals, stay-at-home orders, curfews, mask
[1:01:05.200 --> 1:01:09.800]  mandates, vax mandates and every business closed except big corporate chains like Walmart
[1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:13.480]  and Big Tech, Thriving and the Biggest Transfer, well, they'll credibly say we would never
[1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:15.920]  actually really lock down.
[1:01:15.920 --> 1:01:19.240]  That's what they're redefining it in real time as we speak.
[1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:25.920]  The signs of sabotage are numerous and widespread as the vultures of great reset tyranny, circle-less,
[1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:31.640]  sickened and angered populace that is on track for a mass starvation event in the very near
[1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:32.640]  future.
[1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:35.040]  It was an article on the UN website.
[1:01:35.040 --> 1:01:40.400]  On the further UN, about 860 million people could starve to death in the next 24 months,
[1:01:40.400 --> 1:01:41.400]  almost a billion.
[1:01:41.400 --> 1:01:43.400]  In the next 24 months?
[1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:44.400]  Yeah.
[1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:51.840]  If people depend on you for what's left of the food, you control them.
[1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:57.160]  Where food is abundant and cheap, you do not control them.
[1:01:57.160 --> 1:02:02.080]  Where energy is cheap and abundant, you do not control them.
[1:02:02.080 --> 1:02:07.200]  Energy equals dependency, equals control and that's why they're targeting the food
[1:02:07.200 --> 1:02:11.800]  chain, they're targeting the energy supply, they're targeting everything.
[1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:16.640]  French President Emmanuel Macron's country has been flooded with the United Nations
[1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:22.880]  self-proclaimed replacement migration regardless of what the propaganda denying its existence
[1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:24.160]  would have you believe.
[1:02:24.160 --> 1:02:30.520]  Macron is now priming the pump for energy crises and food shortages as the World Economic
[1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:36.400]  Forum once again tightens its grip on the neck of the French people.
[1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:43.760]  What we are living through is a time of great upheaval, firstly because we are witnessing
[1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:49.240]  and not just since this summer but over the past few years, the end of what we might have
[1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:51.240]  seen as abundance.
[1:02:51.240 --> 1:02:56.200]  Disgraced California Governor Gavin Newsom has said the quiet part out loud, pushing
[1:02:56.200 --> 1:03:04.480]  California towards a goal of zero emissions by 2035 and 30% or 14 million of California's
[1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:08.920]  drivers into electric vehicles within four years.
[1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:14.360]  Currently, there are roughly just a mere one million driving electric vehicles in the
[1:03:14.360 --> 1:03:16.680]  golden state of liberal lunacy.
[1:03:16.680 --> 1:03:22.680]  In the next 15 years, we will eliminate in the state of California the sales of internal
[1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:24.480]  combustion engines.
[1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:27.440]  Sometime he will grip much of the state through the Labor Day weekend.
[1:03:27.440 --> 1:03:31.520]  This morning, Governor Gavin Newsom is laying out ways you can stay safe and prevent putting
[1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:35.040]  a strain on the electrical grid over the upcoming days.
[1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:36.040]  Let's listen in.
[1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:39.960]  We voluntarily ask you to do a little bit more to help us get through the next week
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:46.880]  or so and to turn interestingly up a little bit the thermostat at home to 78 degrees.
[1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:50.840]  Try to pre-cool earlier in the day the home.
[1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:57.400]  Try not to use too much electricity in those key hours and the key hours are between 4pm
[1:03:57.400 --> 1:03:58.600]  and 9pm.
[1:03:58.600 --> 1:04:04.280]  When Biden himself has blazed an unprecedented trail torching our constitutional republic.
[1:04:04.280 --> 1:04:13.200]  The affirmative task we have now is to actually create a new world order.
[1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:20.240]  For those brave, right-wing Americans to say it's all about keeping America, keeping America's
[1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:25.280]  independent and safe, if you want to fight against the country, you need an F-15.
[1:04:25.280 --> 1:04:27.840]  You need something a little more than a gun.
[1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:32.800]  We are watching right now a very radical and extreme republican party mirror what we have
[1:04:32.800 --> 1:04:38.200]  seen in other places like Nazi Germany, like other places like the Bolsheviks.
[1:04:38.200 --> 1:04:45.160]  If we are not able to ask skeptical questions to interrogate those who tell us that something
[1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:53.320]  is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then we are up for grabs for the next charlatan
[1:04:53.320 --> 1:04:56.720]  political or religious who comes ambling along.
[1:04:56.720 --> 1:04:58.920]  John Baum reporting.
[1:04:58.920 --> 1:05:06.560]  The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass
[1:05:06.560 --> 1:05:12.360]  and so many other ingredients that are known to make us healthy, to make us vibrant and
[1:05:12.360 --> 1:05:14.720]  to defend our immune systems.
[1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:18.920]  Now over a year and a half ago, we came out with a product that was top sourced, top the
[1:05:18.920 --> 1:05:23.640]  line as good as it's going to get, but then the supply chain broke down and it was sold
[1:05:23.640 --> 1:05:25.480]  out for more than a year.
[1:05:25.480 --> 1:05:31.200]  Finally, green fiber capsules, this big old bottle jam-packed is back in stock for a limited
[1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:34.520]  time at infowarstore.com, 30% off.
[1:05:34.520 --> 1:05:39.400]  This limited time left time to go into all the great things it does or what it has inside,

[1:05:49.640 --> 1:05:53.280]  We're all under globalist attack, they don't want you to have these essential nutrients
[1:05:53.280 --> 1:05:54.720]  that are in this product.
[1:05:54.720 --> 1:06:21.120]  Get yours today at 25% off at infowarstore.com, now back in stock.
[1:06:21.120 --> 1:06:38.400]  And
[1:06:38.400 --> 1:06:43.040]  during the flex alert again, you are asked to set your thermostat to 78 degrees or higher,
[1:06:43.040 --> 1:06:47.720]  avoid using major appliances and turn off unnecessary lights.
[1:06:47.720 --> 1:06:52.000]  California and many other western states are experiencing simply unprecedented temperatures.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:57.560]  In fact, this heat wave is on track to be both the hottest and the longest on record
[1:06:57.560 --> 1:07:01.560]  for this state and many parts of the west for the month of September.
[1:07:01.560 --> 1:07:06.200]  Californians, you've stepped up to help in a big way to keep the lights on so far, but
[1:07:06.200 --> 1:07:10.920]  we're heading to the worst part of this heat wave and the risk for outages is real and
[1:07:10.920 --> 1:07:12.320]  it's immediate.
[1:07:12.320 --> 1:07:17.440]  These triple digit temperatures throughout much of our state are leading, not surprisingly,
[1:07:17.440 --> 1:07:20.160]  the record demand on the energy grid.
[1:07:20.160 --> 1:07:24.880]  Everyone has to do their part to help step up for just a few more days.
[1:07:24.880 --> 1:07:29.320]  Individuals, the state, industries, business, all doing their part to help reduce strain
[1:07:29.320 --> 1:07:30.320]  on the grid.
[1:07:30.320 --> 1:07:34.280]  Now, here's specifically what you can do in the early morning hours, particularly tomorrow
[1:07:34.280 --> 1:07:37.280]  and the next day or so, pre-cool your home.
[1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:42.680]  Run your air conditioning earlier in the day when more power is available and we encourage
[1:07:42.680 --> 1:07:46.680]  you to close your windows and blinds to keep your home cool as well.
[1:07:46.680 --> 1:07:53.080]  And today and tomorrow afternoon after 4 p.m., in particular 4 p.m., please turn your thermostat
[1:07:53.080 --> 1:07:59.800]  up to 78 degrees or higher and avoid to the extent possible using any really large appliances.
[1:07:59.800 --> 1:08:03.800]  You can visit flexalert.org to learn more about what you can do.
[1:08:03.800 --> 1:08:07.720]  Californians, you've rallied before and we can do it again.
[1:08:07.720 --> 1:08:08.720]  Keep it up.
[1:08:08.720 --> 1:08:14.800]  And this is what is expensive because in these peak demands, the expensive gas comes into
[1:08:14.800 --> 1:08:16.160]  the market.
[1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:22.760]  So what we have to do is flatten the curve and avoid the peak demands.
[1:08:22.760 --> 1:08:29.200]  We will propose a mandatory target for reducing electricity use at peak hours.
[1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:34.760]  And we will work very closely with the member states to achieve this.
[1:08:34.760 --> 1:08:40.520]  Three-year prison sentences in European countries now have you tampered with the smart thermostat
[1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:42.960]  that they put in your house that we told you would do this.
[1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:49.360]  Now, in Colorado, in California, in New York, they're taking control of your thermostats
[1:08:49.360 --> 1:08:52.520]  through the, quote, smart grid.
[1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:54.160]  Told you it was all coming.
[1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:57.040]  And you know, that's what's the most frustrating about this, is they cut off thousands of
[1:08:57.040 --> 1:09:01.320]  power plants, they cut the energy grid, they get rid of the pipelines, then they say it's
[1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:02.320]  global warming.
[1:09:02.320 --> 1:09:06.440]  Remember, global warming caused the Wuhan virus, though they cooked it up and released
[1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:07.440]  it.
[1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:08.440]  Everything's the global warming.
[1:09:08.440 --> 1:09:09.960]  That's why the world's going to end.
[1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:14.240]  They've told you in 2030, because they're ending the world as we know it.
[1:09:14.240 --> 1:09:19.760]  They are bureaucratically, through the corporations, squeezing everyone to bankrupt us through
[1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:22.520]  or under their control.
[1:09:22.520 --> 1:09:23.520]  That's a fact.
[1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:27.240]  Now, it was in Ron 30 years ago, came up with a global warming carbon tax plan.
[1:09:27.240 --> 1:09:28.240]  That's on record.
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:31.880]  And it was in Ron that would put up the fake computer programs and show members of Congress
[1:09:31.880 --> 1:09:36.200]  and legislators that came to do tours, when some days they'd make up a $3 billion extra
[1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:43.080]  back then in the 90s, that was like $10, $15 billion a day extra.
[1:09:43.080 --> 1:09:47.840]  By gouging people saying there wasn't enough power having rolling blackouts, they found
[1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:51.600]  people would accept much higher energy bills.
[1:09:51.600 --> 1:09:56.920]  So they're robbing you while they bankrupt you to control you.
[1:09:56.920 --> 1:09:57.920]  It's unbelievable.
[1:09:57.920 --> 1:10:00.680]  They fly around on private jets, but say you shouldn't have a car.
[1:10:00.680 --> 1:10:05.760]  They live in palatial mansions and have five, six kids, but you shouldn't have air conditioning.
[1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:09.120]  They are cutting off our society and they write textbooks about it.
[1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:10.120]  They brag about it.
[1:10:10.120 --> 1:10:11.120]  I've written books on it.
[1:10:11.120 --> 1:10:17.120]  I've made films on it years ago, wrote a book talking about this 20 years ago, made
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:19.800]  a film on it 15 years ago.
[1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:21.120]  It's an exact plan.
[1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:26.680]  It's a program and they tell you 15 days to flatten the curves, it's staying in your
[1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:29.800]  house 15 days, some areas of the world, it was two years.
[1:10:29.800 --> 1:10:31.920]  They try to keep it permanent.
[1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:33.720]  And then what did they say about six months ago?
[1:10:33.720 --> 1:10:37.560]  They said, we're done with COVID for now.
[1:10:37.560 --> 1:10:43.360]  We're going to move on to global warming and carbon credits and all the rest of it.
[1:10:43.360 --> 1:10:48.760]  First, we've got to artificially cut the energy off to train people to accept this new austerity.
[1:10:48.760 --> 1:10:52.360]  And McCron says, the end of prosperity is here.
[1:10:52.360 --> 1:10:54.800]  The end of plenty is here.
[1:10:54.800 --> 1:10:57.200]  The end of the good times are here.
[1:10:57.200 --> 1:10:58.440]  You will eat bugs.
[1:10:58.440 --> 1:10:59.760]  You will own nothing.
[1:10:59.760 --> 1:11:02.960]  You will have nothing and you will like it.
[1:11:02.960 --> 1:11:04.360]  This is all a giant test.
[1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:13.000]  As I said, California is leading the way for the rest of America and it's lockstep with
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:19.360]  the Bilderberg group, spokesperson, Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum.
[1:11:19.360 --> 1:11:23.200]  It's the same program in Australia, the same program in New Zealand, the same program in
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:28.880]  France, in Germany, in the Netherlands, in Italy, in the UK, in Canada, in the US.
[1:11:28.880 --> 1:11:34.960]  The same big corporations thinking we're so stupid that they start cutting off the energy
[1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:40.760]  supply, charging you more for what's left, and then telling you that it's global warming
[1:11:40.760 --> 1:11:41.760]  that caused it.
[1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:44.000]  But in Europe, they can't push that lie.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:46.920]  This is not the hottest temperatures in California history.
[1:11:46.920 --> 1:11:49.880]  It's the fourth highest reported since the 1950s.
[1:11:49.880 --> 1:11:50.880]  I looked the numbers up.
[1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:52.280]  That's why Gavin Newsom was very careful.
[1:11:52.280 --> 1:11:53.280]  He's a good liar.
[1:11:53.280 --> 1:12:04.640]  We're on track to have the hottest September on record, with 24 days left in the month.
[1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:08.120]  Remember, they said England's had the hottest temperatures on record.
[1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:13.520]  It turned out they've had at least 10 years against us in the 1950s that were way hotter,
[1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:20.480]  up to three degrees a day hotter, lies, lies, lies, lies.
[1:12:20.480 --> 1:12:23.920]  This California passes the ban on gas cars.
[1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:28.720]  Right as all this comes in, two months ago, they banned the sale already of any small
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:38.280]  combustion engine, lawnmowers, golf carts, weed eaters, all of it.
[1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:42.960]  And the power to control technology is the power to control us all.
[1:12:42.960 --> 1:12:47.920]  We have thousands of years of coal, thousands of years of oil, and now they're making
[1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:55.040]  their move for artificial scarcity, feudalism, to make you poor and easily under their control.
[1:12:55.040 --> 1:13:00.600]  Cheap energy means freedom, inexpensive food means freedom, mobility.
[1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:07.560]  But they write all their big U.N. reports up going back to 1996 and before saying if
[1:13:07.560 --> 1:13:14.000]  we can simply make people spend half their money on energy and food, they'll have no
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:18.640]  discretionary income to be politically upward mobile, and I've got reports, video clips
[1:13:18.640 --> 1:13:23.760]  out of the German government saying we're going to play coming up.
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:30.840]  The craft of businesses, small restaurants, hair cutting salons, maid services are non-essential.
[1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:35.480]  Only big box stores will be allowed to operate.
[1:13:35.480 --> 1:13:37.360]  It is a big box stores.
[1:13:37.360 --> 1:13:42.880]  It is the big tech companies who are waging war on their small businesses, and they just
[1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:46.920]  throw it in your face because they've got the public demoralized, they've already got
[1:13:46.920 --> 1:13:50.600]  the public at Stockholm Center, I'm at least half the public.
[1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:56.240]  And so now they're pressing it, 15 days flattened cove, power come back.
[1:13:56.240 --> 1:14:01.600]  But if you read the U.N. and the W.E.F. report from two days ago, they said, 10 years of
[1:14:01.600 --> 1:14:03.480]  no power.
[1:14:03.480 --> 1:14:09.520]  It's a beautiful transition that we're all part of, then meanwhile, told you about this
[1:14:09.520 --> 1:14:17.240]  weeks ago, but now it's in the news, U.N. education agency launches war on conspiracy
[1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:18.240]  theories.
[1:14:18.240 --> 1:14:24.040]  A month ago, the W.E.F. says we've hired 130,000 info warriors to counter Alex Jones
[1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:27.080]  and others, proud to be named.
[1:14:27.080 --> 1:14:32.000]  And then two weeks later, the U.N. announces, and now it's in the news, that the U.N. is
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:34.800]  going to challenge conspiracy theories.
[1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:38.240]  If you question elections, if you question open borders, if you talk about replacement
[1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:42.000]  migration, that's on their own website, if you talk about the shots not working, if
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:49.800]  you talk about lockdowns being wrong, U.S. be fined, U.S. be arrested, Switzerland faced
[1:14:49.800 --> 1:14:55.760]  up to three years in prison for violating heating and cooling rules.
[1:14:55.760 --> 1:15:01.080]  It's all here, and of the public's dumb enough to accept it, and dumb enough to go along
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:02.240]  whether we deserve what we get.
[1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:05.080]  But that's what's so frustrating.
[1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:08.720]  Is that we know what this is, we know this plan.
[1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:13.160]  This is the great reset, this is the great transition, this is the new world order.
[1:15:13.160 --> 1:15:16.880]  They want you poor, they want you dependent, they want you all on the universal basic income,
[1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:20.080]  and now they've announced, oh, the world's collapsing, there's no energy, oh, because
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:21.080]  of COVID.
[1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:23.800]  No, because of the COVID lockdowns they launched, and Klaus Schwab said two and a half years
[1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:28.160]  ago, next will be the climate crisis, and we will have the climate lockdowns.
[1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:32.680]  And I'm like, they're going to do it in a couple of years, and here we are, and it's
[1:15:32.680 --> 1:15:33.680]  happening.
[1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:37.800]  In Boston-Bergstrom Airport, last time I checked, still doesn't have power.
[1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:39.880]  That damn thing's hooked into the critical grid.
[1:15:39.880 --> 1:15:41.480]  They shut it off.
[1:15:41.480 --> 1:15:42.480]  They do it on purpose.
[1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:46.280]  The feds ordered two years ago through the Texas freeze to not up the power output and
[1:15:46.280 --> 1:15:48.240]  shut the power off.
[1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:50.920]  This is criminal, this is terrorist.
[1:15:50.920 --> 1:15:55.240]  This is the extinction rebellion at the government level, and we need Congress and others to
[1:15:55.240 --> 1:15:58.480]  stand against it.
[1:15:58.480 --> 1:16:01.760]  People ask me all the time, what is your best new tropic?
[1:16:01.760 --> 1:16:03.360]  You've got turbo force.
[1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:07.400]  You've got brain force plus, and you've got brain force ultra.
[1:16:07.400 --> 1:16:09.000]  Which one is better?
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:17.880]  And that's like asking, what's better, a Ford F-150, or a Cadillac, or a Ferrari?
[1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:19.880]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[1:16:19.880 --> 1:16:25.280]  It varies, all three are different formulas, all three do different things.
[1:16:25.280 --> 1:16:32.080]  Turbo force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy, I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[1:16:32.080 --> 1:16:36.120]  Brain force plus is a long-term acting, clean, new tropic.
[1:16:36.120 --> 1:16:43.160]  This brain force ultra is a super fast acting, new tropic, that creates incredible clarity
[1:16:43.160 --> 1:16:44.760]  but doesn't last very long.
[1:16:44.760 --> 1:16:46.640]  They're all three different formulas.
[1:16:46.640 --> 1:16:53.960]  And finally, back in stock, massively discounted, brain force ultra is available at infowarstore.com.
[1:16:53.960 --> 1:16:58.720]  Brain force ultra, back in stock, infowarstore.com.

[1:17:02.880 --> 1:17:04.680]  What does ultimate mean?
[1:17:04.680 --> 1:17:09.120]  That's just our name for the best, the highest grade.
[1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:16.120]  What this concentrated and chovy oil, pure arctic krill oil, and high quality wild caught
[1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:22.440]  salmon oil does for your brain, your heart, your cardiovascular system, and for your entire
[1:17:22.440 --> 1:17:25.400]  body's functions is insane.
[1:17:25.400 --> 1:17:30.520]  Pure low grade fish oil in all the studies does outstanding things.
[1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:35.520]  This is the highest grade and it's not been pasteurized, it's not been boiled, so it
[1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:38.040]  has its original effects intact.
[1:17:38.040 --> 1:17:43.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, everybody should visit infowarstore.com today and get ultimate fish

[1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:50.640]  great it is.
[1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:55.000]  But for folks that have been on the fence, experience ultimate fish oil for yourself.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  Not taking some before bed time and see what happens with your dreams.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:02.440]  Get our great, got a bag of it here.
[1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:07.160]  I mean this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:11.880]  Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[1:18:11.880 --> 1:18:15.680]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee, and yeah, we buy it from the little
[1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:19.600]  farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune, and whatever
[1:18:19.600 --> 1:18:23.160]  the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it, and the farmers don't let the
[1:18:23.160 --> 1:18:26.240]  Mexican government take over, so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels, and I've
[1:18:26.240 --> 1:18:28.800]  been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:33.200]  The same stuff's sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more, per pound,
[1:18:33.200 --> 1:18:35.680]  and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere.
[1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:39.920]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally, in fact, I'm
[1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:47.240]  not gonna tell you a little story, um, yeah, I'd like to, okay, you wouldn't believe it.
[1:18:47.240 --> 1:18:52.200]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation, and if you don't
[1:18:52.200 --> 1:18:58.240]  fund us and don't want to see it, that's fine.
[1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:05.240]  The number one selling category in supplements worldwide is fat burners, is weight loss formulas,
[1:19:05.240 --> 1:19:10.280]  and listen, there are hundreds of them out there that work, but most of them do it in
[1:19:10.280 --> 1:19:12.160]  a toxic way.
[1:19:12.160 --> 1:19:16.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we went out and did deep research on the safest, healthiest ways
[1:19:16.680 --> 1:19:25.000]  to take your overall body's metabolic system and your metabolism and turn that clock back
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:28.240]  by turning up your metabolism.
[1:19:28.240 --> 1:19:31.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, Diet Force does it in a clean, healthy way.
[1:19:31.640 --> 1:19:32.640]  It's amazing.
[1:19:32.640 --> 1:19:37.120]  I've almost lost 40 pounds in the last three months just using the samples of it, but now
[1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:42.040]  it's come into the infowar store and it's ready for sale to you and your family exclusively
[1:19:42.040 --> 1:19:44.440]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:19:44.440 --> 1:19:51.600]  Diet Force from X7 exclusively available at infowarstore.com for 40% off.
[1:19:51.600 --> 1:19:53.840]  I want you to experience Diet Force for yourself.
[1:19:53.840 --> 1:19:59.200]  I can't wait for the reviews because it's worked great for me.
[1:19:59.200 --> 1:20:16.640]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:16.640 --> 1:20:34.040]  As we've often noted on this show, because it's hard not to notice, we are living in
[1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:38.280]  one of those moments where so much is happening all at once and information about it all is
[1:20:38.280 --> 1:20:40.240]  so tightly controlled.
[1:20:40.240 --> 1:20:45.400]  That huge history changing events can occur and in fact are occurring right now and nobody
[1:20:45.400 --> 1:20:47.640]  seems aware of them.
[1:20:47.640 --> 1:20:48.880]  It's pretty unsettling actually.
[1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:50.440]  Here's one example.
[1:20:50.440 --> 1:20:52.800]  Europe is descending into poverty.
[1:20:52.800 --> 1:20:53.800]  Did you know that?
[1:20:53.800 --> 1:20:55.160]  Had someone told you that?
[1:20:55.160 --> 1:20:58.600]  So the most advanced continent on the planet, the birthplace of Western civilization, our
[1:20:58.600 --> 1:21:02.240]  civilization, is getting much poorer very quickly.
[1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:05.000]  It's moving backward at high speed.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:07.920]  Just a year ago, Europe was a modern place.
[1:21:07.920 --> 1:21:11.600]  For example, the overwhelming majority of Europeans heated their homes with natural gas
[1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:13.480]  as modern people do.
[1:21:13.480 --> 1:21:18.160]  In Germany, the continent's richest country, only about 6% of households, most of them
[1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:20.320]  rural, heated with cored wood.
[1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:25.920]  And you'd expect that given that, again, Germany is a modern industrialized country
[1:21:25.920 --> 1:21:29.840]  with central heating and indoor plumbing and all the other trappings of a society that
[1:21:29.840 --> 1:21:33.440]  has moved beyond the medieval period.
[1:21:33.440 --> 1:21:38.000]  Last year, only about 6% of Germans used wood to heat their homes, but that has changed
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:39.500]  dramatically.
[1:21:39.500 --> 1:21:45.640]  Even for firewood in Germany, has risen so fast that there is none left to buy.
[1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:46.920]  You can't get it.
[1:21:46.920 --> 1:21:51.800]  So desperate Germans are now cutting their own wood, scouring the forests like their
[1:21:51.800 --> 1:21:54.600]  ancestors for sources of heat.
[1:21:54.600 --> 1:21:55.600]  Watch.
[1:21:55.600 --> 1:21:59.960]  Some in Germany are taking matters into their own hands, a solution that might look like
[1:21:59.960 --> 1:22:02.200]  a blast from the past.
[1:22:02.200 --> 1:22:06.080]  About two hours outside Berlin, residents of this small town have turned to woodchips
[1:22:06.080 --> 1:22:08.360]  for fuel.
[1:22:08.360 --> 1:22:10.780]  We have to be innovative, said the project's organizer.
[1:22:10.780 --> 1:22:15.520]  If we don't act and just rely on the government to solve the crisis, we'll never succeed.
[1:22:15.520 --> 1:22:21.280]  This burner will soon fuel most of this village of 60 people.
[1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:24.160]  So they call it biomass, but it's wood.
[1:22:24.160 --> 1:22:28.520]  They're burning wood, again, as they did during the feudal period.
[1:22:28.520 --> 1:22:29.680]  That's Germany.
[1:22:29.680 --> 1:22:35.960]  In Poland, families are standing in line for days to buy coal, not in 1910, right now,
[1:22:35.960 --> 1:22:36.960]  tonight.
[1:22:36.960 --> 1:22:40.520]  They're just queued up outside coal mines, hoping for fuel.
[1:22:40.520 --> 1:22:46.160]  Quote, this is beyond imagination, 157-year-old Polish man told Reuters.
[1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:47.760]  People are sleeping in their cars.
[1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:52.680]  I remember the Communist times, but it didn't cross my mind that we could return to something
[1:22:52.680 --> 1:22:53.680]  even worse.
[1:22:53.680 --> 1:22:55.560]  Oh, but it's come.
[1:22:55.560 --> 1:22:57.640]  Something even worse has arrived.
[1:22:57.640 --> 1:23:00.760]  The French government has announced energy rationing this winter.
[1:23:00.760 --> 1:23:04.240]  Just the other day, France had so much energy that it exported it to other countries.
[1:23:04.240 --> 1:23:06.400]  It was a net exporter of energy.
[1:23:06.400 --> 1:23:11.080]  Now there won't be enough heat in France for everyone in the country to stay warm.
[1:23:11.080 --> 1:23:15.800]  In the UK, 70% of restaurants are preparing to close, to go under.
[1:23:15.800 --> 1:23:16.800]  Why?
[1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:19.760]  Because when winter comes, they won't be able to afford to keep the heat and lights
[1:23:19.760 --> 1:23:20.880]  on, et cetera, et cetera.
[1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:23.880]  This is happening across Europe and every country.
[1:23:23.880 --> 1:23:25.080]  So the question is, why is it happening?
[1:23:25.080 --> 1:23:26.680]  And the answer is extremely simple.
[1:23:26.680 --> 1:23:29.680]  There is an energy shortage in Europe.
[1:23:29.680 --> 1:23:30.680]  Cheap energy is essential.
[1:23:30.680 --> 1:23:36.320]  It is the key to everything that a normal society strives for, prosperity, safety,
[1:23:36.320 --> 1:23:39.280]  a longer life expectancy for its citizens.
[1:23:39.280 --> 1:23:43.040]  Everything depends on cheap energy, but Europe no longer has it.
[1:23:43.040 --> 1:23:46.120]  And as a result, things are falling apart very quickly.
[1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:50.400]  Energy costs in Europe are expected to increase by hundreds of percent in coming months.
[1:23:50.400 --> 1:23:54.280]  Germany's year ahead price of electricity, that's the benchmark for all of Europe, it's
[1:23:54.280 --> 1:23:58.920]  measured in euros per megawatt hour, that price just exceeded a thousand euros for the
[1:23:58.920 --> 1:24:01.320]  first time in history.
[1:24:01.320 --> 1:24:07.240]  For a perspective, just a week ago, last Monday, the cost was about 700 euros per megawatt
[1:24:07.240 --> 1:24:08.240]  hour.
[1:24:08.240 --> 1:24:09.920]  And that was the record.
[1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:15.200]  In other words, the price rise is approaching 50 percent in a single week.
[1:24:15.200 --> 1:24:18.880]  In France, electricity went up 25 percent in one day.
[1:24:18.880 --> 1:24:21.040]  That was last Friday.
[1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:23.040]  Imagine that happening to you.
[1:24:23.040 --> 1:24:25.680]  Here's what Europe looks like tonight.
[1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:30.360]  In Europe, it lights out in major monuments and tourist attractions as a long, hot summer
[1:24:30.360 --> 1:24:34.880]  gives way to what officials worry could be a bitterly cold winter.
[1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:39.040]  Skyrocketing energy prices have put Europe on a war footing with Russia as the enemy.
[1:24:39.040 --> 1:24:45.560]  We're in what can be described as a hybrid war, said French President Emmanuel Macron.
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:51.000]  Russia uses energy resources like it does food as a war weapon to exert pressure.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:55.920]  Oil prices have doubled, coal prices have quadrupled, and natural gas is now seven times
[1:24:55.920 --> 1:24:59.560]  more expensive than early last year.
[1:24:59.560 --> 1:25:01.600]  Seven times more expensive.
[1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:07.520]  So it turns out if you don't have cheap natural gas, you can't run the continent.
[1:25:07.520 --> 1:25:11.360]  Now, if you've got a graduate degree and live in a city in the United States, you may be
[1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:12.360]  shocked to learn this.
[1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:13.640]  You may never have heard this before.
[1:25:13.640 --> 1:25:17.640]  You may have believed that fossil fuels were on their way out any day now.
[1:25:17.640 --> 1:25:21.240]  And you thought that because the Davos people and our own leaders assured us of that for
[1:25:21.240 --> 1:25:22.240]  decades.
[1:25:22.240 --> 1:25:25.160]  They told us that green energy was the future and the future is here.
[1:25:25.160 --> 1:25:26.560]  It's here.
[1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:31.160]  As recently as last month, the World Economic Forum claimed that Europe could save, quote,
[1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:35.840]  one trillion in fossil fuel costs by switching to renewables.
[1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:41.200]  But it turns out, and this may not shock you, they had no clue what they were talking about.
[1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:46.360]  They knew nothing about the subject, the subject they talked about endlessly.
[1:25:46.360 --> 1:25:51.880]  Green energy cannot replace fossil fuels, not now, not anytime soon.
[1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:56.240]  Fossil fuels remain what they have always been, the key to civilization.
[1:25:56.240 --> 1:25:57.240]  That is true now.
[1:25:57.240 --> 1:26:01.880]  That has been true since Homo erectus started the first cooking fire in a cave nearly a
[1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:04.160]  million years ago.
[1:26:04.160 --> 1:26:12.560]  So-called green energy is not close, is nowhere near replacing gas and oil and coal.
[1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:13.880]  It's measurable.
[1:26:13.880 --> 1:26:15.600]  We could have known this.
[1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:19.600]  Anyone with eighth grade math skills could have figured out in about 10 minutes that
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:25.360]  we cannot replace fossil fuels with renewables or green energy.
[1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:27.240]  And of course, they must have known that.
[1:26:27.240 --> 1:26:29.520]  When they told you otherwise, it was just posturing.
[1:26:29.520 --> 1:26:34.520]  It was childish and destructive fantasy talk that apparently fooled millions of their citizens
[1:26:34.520 --> 1:26:36.960]  and millions of hours.
[1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:39.720]  The Green New Deal means what it always meant.
[1:26:39.720 --> 1:26:41.800]  It means poverty.
[1:26:41.800 --> 1:26:45.400]  And the people pushing the Green New Deal must have known that all along.
[1:26:45.400 --> 1:26:48.480]  They don't actually believe climate change is an imminent threat.
[1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:52.400]  If they actually believe climate change was an imminent threat, an existential emergency,
[1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:56.480]  the first thing they would have done, the very first would be to ban private jets.
[1:26:56.480 --> 1:26:57.840]  Oh, but no.
[1:26:57.840 --> 1:27:01.160]  To this day, Al Gore still flies on private jets.
[1:27:01.160 --> 1:27:04.720]  Barack Obama owns tens of millions of dollars of beachfront property.
[1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:06.960]  He knows the oceans aren't rising.
[1:27:06.960 --> 1:27:08.040]  Come on.
[1:27:08.040 --> 1:27:09.040]  So they're all in on it.
[1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:13.120]  It's a scam, but they don't care because they know they personally will escape the
[1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:15.800]  consequences of their own policies.
[1:27:15.800 --> 1:27:19.680]  So when the French president announces that his people are facing the end of abundance,
[1:27:19.680 --> 1:27:21.440]  he's not talking about himself.
[1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:22.920]  He's not facing the end of abundance.
[1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:23.920]  None of them are.
[1:27:23.920 --> 1:27:28.440]  Macron and all of them understand they will always be rich and always be protected.
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:30.720]  They know that for certain.
[1:27:30.720 --> 1:27:35.200]  What's changed, what's so very interesting, is that suddenly everyone else who's been
[1:27:35.200 --> 1:27:37.440]  paying attention can see that they were lying.
[1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:41.400]  They are frauds and the entire population of Europe now knows that.
[1:27:41.400 --> 1:27:45.720]  Donald Trump, his credit, whatever you think of him, caught on to this early.
[1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:50.320]  Four years ago, Trump warned Europe about its energy future during a speech of the United
[1:27:50.320 --> 1:27:51.320]  Nations.
[1:27:51.320 --> 1:27:54.000]  The German delegation laughed at him.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:55.880]  Remember this?
[1:27:55.880 --> 1:28:06.000]  Germany will become totally dependent on Russian energy if it does not immediately change course.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:15.040]  Here in the Western Hemisphere, we are committed to maintaining our independence from the encroachment
[1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:19.120]  of expansionist foreign powers.
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:24.160]  It has been the formal policy of our country since President Monroe.
[1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:29.600]  Odd, folks, so the reason I aired a large part of Tucker Carlson's monologue is because
[1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:33.920]  he's one of the only national figures that'll tell you the truth and say this is premeditated
[1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:35.320]  by design.
[1:28:35.320 --> 1:28:36.720]  This is being held hostage.
[1:28:36.720 --> 1:28:38.160]  This is total control.
[1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:39.160]  This is war.
[1:28:39.160 --> 1:28:40.760]  Cutting people's energy off is war.
[1:28:40.760 --> 1:28:41.760]  They tell you it's global warming.
[1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:43.880]  No, they've cut the power plants off.
[1:28:43.880 --> 1:28:47.600]  They've done it all and premeditatedly put smart meters in your house to control everything
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:51.040]  and now put you in jail in many areas if you don't do what they say.
[1:28:51.040 --> 1:28:52.040]  It's a technocracy.
[1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:58.160]  It's the next stage of big tech tyranny and it must be stopped now.
[1:28:58.160 --> 1:29:05.800]  The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass
[1:29:05.800 --> 1:29:11.600]  and so many other ingredients that are known to make us healthy, to make us vibrant and
[1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:13.960]  to defend our immune systems.
[1:29:13.960 --> 1:29:18.160]  Now over a year and a half ago, we came out with a product that was top sourced, top the
[1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:22.880]  line as good as it's going to get, but then the supply chain broke down and it was sold
[1:29:22.880 --> 1:29:24.720]  out for more than a year.
[1:29:24.720 --> 1:29:30.120]  Finally, green fiber capsules, this big old bottle jam-packed, is back in stock for a
[1:29:30.120 --> 1:29:33.760]  limited time at infowarstore.com, 30% off.
[1:29:33.760 --> 1:29:38.320]  This limited time left time to go into all the great things it does or what it has inside,

[1:29:43.480 --> 1:29:44.480]  it is.
[1:29:44.480 --> 1:29:48.440]  And what's just as amazing is, it funds the info war and keeps us on air.
[1:29:48.440 --> 1:29:50.320]  We're all under globalist attack.
[1:29:50.320 --> 1:29:53.960]  They don't want you to have these essential nutrients that are in this product.
[1:29:53.960 --> 1:29:58.200]  Get yours today at 25% off at infowarstore.com, now back in stock.
[1:29:58.200 --> 1:30:01.480]  People ask me all the time, what is your best new tropic?
[1:30:01.480 --> 1:30:07.120]  You've got turbo force, you've got brain force plus, and you've got brain force ultra.
[1:30:07.120 --> 1:30:08.720]  Which one is better?
[1:30:08.720 --> 1:30:17.600]  And that's like asking, what's better, a Ford F-150, or a Cadillac, or a Ferrari.
[1:30:17.600 --> 1:30:19.600]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[1:30:19.600 --> 1:30:24.960]  It varies, all three are different formulas, all three do different things.
[1:30:24.960 --> 1:30:31.800]  Turbo force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy, I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[1:30:31.800 --> 1:30:35.800]  Brain force plus is a long term acting clean new tropic.
[1:30:35.800 --> 1:30:42.960]  Brain force ultra is a super fast acting new tropic that creates incredible clarity, but
[1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:44.440]  doesn't last very long.
[1:30:44.440 --> 1:30:46.320]  They're all three different formulas.
[1:30:46.320 --> 1:30:53.720]  And finally, back in stock, massively discounted, brain force ultra is available at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:53.720 --> 1:30:57.880]  Brain force ultra, back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[1:30:57.880 --> 1:31:01.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, if millions of people get this book, our funding problems will be
[1:31:01.320 --> 1:31:03.200]  over and it's starting to happen.
[1:31:03.200 --> 1:31:05.360]  That's why I said, yeah, go to infowarstore.com.
[1:31:05.360 --> 1:31:06.360]  Get the book.
[1:31:06.360 --> 1:31:07.360]  It starts shipping in a couple of weeks.
[1:31:07.360 --> 1:31:10.480]  The Great Reset and the War for the World, but I said go to Amazon because it's the
[1:31:10.480 --> 1:31:15.040]  number one book chart in the world and if it goes to number one, not a political, not
[1:31:15.040 --> 1:31:19.680]  of history, not of US history, it's already number one over 40 categories like political
[1:31:19.680 --> 1:31:20.920]  science, you name it.
[1:31:20.920 --> 1:31:23.040]  40 plus categories is number one.
[1:31:23.040 --> 1:31:28.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, drum roll please of books in the world.
[1:31:28.080 --> 1:31:34.040]  The Great Reset and the War for the World is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[1:31:34.040 --> 1:31:38.780]  We are now number nine in the world.
[1:31:38.780 --> 1:31:43.920]  This is major, this is political, this could fund our war chest, just go to Amazon.com
[1:31:43.920 --> 1:31:46.400]  everybody and buy 10 copies.
[1:31:46.400 --> 1:31:50.920]  Send this blueprint to the Death Star and the New World Order because you read this, you
[1:31:50.920 --> 1:31:52.320]  know their whole plan, how to stop them.
[1:31:52.320 --> 1:31:54.200]  Get the Great Reset and War for the World now.
[1:31:54.200 --> 1:31:55.200]  It's going to go to number one.
[1:31:55.200 --> 1:32:03.000]  What do you make of that?
[1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:13.380]  Let me say I love your products, I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there
[1:32:13.380 --> 1:32:17.840]  that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or
[1:32:17.840 --> 1:32:20.440]  age spots as they're lovingly called.
[1:32:20.440 --> 1:32:26.440]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[1:32:26.440 --> 1:32:29.760]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:32:29.760 --> 1:32:33.800]  And I was already taking your other supplements but I thought, you know, well maybe that's
[1:32:33.800 --> 1:32:38.080]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation but when I started
[1:32:38.080 --> 1:32:43.080]  taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately but you know, over a period of time, I started
[1:32:43.080 --> 1:32:48.120]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[1:32:48.120 --> 1:32:54.440]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[1:32:54.440 --> 1:32:59.600]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:11.600]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:11.600 --> 1:33:17.320]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:33:17.320 --> 1:33:19.400]  You want to stop tyranny?
[1:33:19.400 --> 1:33:21.520]  Well so does he.
[1:33:21.520 --> 1:33:35.520]  This is what is expensive because in these peak demands, the expensive gas comes into
[1:33:35.520 --> 1:33:36.880]  the market.
[1:33:36.880 --> 1:33:43.440]  So what we have to do is flatten the curve and avoid the peak demands.
[1:33:43.440 --> 1:33:50.520]  We will propose a mandatory target for reducing electricity use at peak hours and we will work
[1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:56.520]  very closely with the member states to achieve this.
[1:33:56.520 --> 1:34:04.920]  The worst part of the two weeks to flatten the curve is the first two years.
[1:34:04.920 --> 1:34:08.360]  Told you two and a half years ago they would run the exact same propaganda for climate
[1:34:08.360 --> 1:34:09.360]  change.
[1:34:09.360 --> 1:34:10.640]  How did I know that?
[1:34:10.640 --> 1:34:13.240]  People freak out, they say he's an insider, he works for them.
[1:34:13.240 --> 1:34:16.840]  No, they give speeches and write books and white papers about it and nothing is more
[1:34:16.840 --> 1:34:22.200]  frustrating than sitting here, watching them do this and to be under massive attack for
[1:34:22.200 --> 1:34:27.880]  telling the truth and the public still won't get what's going on.
[1:34:27.880 --> 1:34:32.360]  But the politicians, the so-called Republican leaders at the state houses and the cities
[1:34:32.360 --> 1:34:36.760]  that aren't under full Democrat control, they know what's going on and they're not bucking
[1:34:36.760 --> 1:34:41.840]  the trend because they've been paid off as well.
[1:34:41.840 --> 1:34:47.320]  There is a handful of people in Congress even talking about this.
[1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:49.280]  You hear Ted Cruz talking about it?
[1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:53.360]  No, Ted Cruz called the January 6th protesters terrorist.
[1:34:53.360 --> 1:34:58.880]  Ted Cruz is a Benedict Arnold and an enemy of this country.
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:04.720]  Josh Hawley, Rand Paul, they're good people but I got to tell you, they're going to rape
[1:35:04.720 --> 1:35:09.560]  the hell out of us, ladies and gentlemen, they're already raping us and we sit here
[1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:13.280]  and we put up with it, America will be one giant blue city.
[1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:21.200]  One giant species, needle-filled, homeless-filled, powerless system just like third-world dictatorships
[1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:31.400]  and that's what they're doing to the American people.
[1:35:31.400 --> 1:35:43.520]  Here is the German economic minister, the head of the economy, Habek says he can imagine
[1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:48.120]  parts of the economy will simply stop producing for the time being.
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:55.840]  You want to say, bakeries, craft businesses, oh, see, they're not essential, craft, you
[1:35:55.840 --> 1:36:00.640]  little people, cleaning companies, oh, you don't get your house cleaning more, they can
[1:36:00.640 --> 1:36:08.040]  just stop producing this year but they don't go insolvent because they're going to get
[1:36:08.040 --> 1:36:14.920]  a bailout, they don't work into the red because the government gives them a dole, that's the
[1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:20.540]  universal basic income and then of course they don't come back after that.
[1:36:20.540 --> 1:36:25.160]  But you take a year vacation, you never come back but all you remember is you thought you
[1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:26.360]  got a free year.
[1:36:26.360 --> 1:36:32.440]  There's no free lunch just like, they'll quote, student loan bailout, the student loan
[1:36:32.440 --> 1:36:33.440]  forgiveness.
[1:36:33.440 --> 1:36:41.040]  They give you a workless education with most degrees and then they bail you out but it
[1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:46.320]  causes massive inflation.
[1:36:46.320 --> 1:36:56.240]  This is total and complete absolute enslavement.
[1:36:56.240 --> 1:36:58.160]  Their answer is censor us.
[1:36:58.160 --> 1:37:05.120]  UN Education Agency launches war on conspiracy theories, California now in a flex alert,
[1:37:05.120 --> 1:37:06.120]  what does that mean?
[1:37:06.120 --> 1:37:11.000]  Well, we're going to control your thermostats and cut your power off but why was it caused?
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:15.120]  Not cutting off the power plants, not restricting their energy, no, climate change, overwhelm
[1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:22.560]  California's power grid, now they say don't charge your electric cars and they're introducing
[1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:29.560]  everybody to this authoritarian model with real-time analysis spying on your appliances
[1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:41.400]  but don't worry, they're going to save you from the problem that they have created.
[1:37:41.400 --> 1:37:44.800]  During a flex alert, what do you do?
[1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:51.360]  Unplug unused items, use less for cooling, turn off all unnecessary lights, avoid using
[1:37:51.360 --> 1:38:01.920]  major appliances, set thermostats at 78 if health permits and they say prepare for rolling
[1:38:01.920 --> 1:38:05.240]  blackouts and they blame global warming.
[1:38:05.240 --> 1:38:08.680]  Swiss face up to three years in prison for violating heating rules.
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:12.040]  People in Switzerland who violate the country's new heating rules which forbid setting temperature
[1:38:12.040 --> 1:38:22.840]  above 19 Celsius or 66 degrees in the cooler months will face up to three years in prison.
[1:38:22.840 --> 1:38:27.920]  See the full report by Tucker Carlson at infowars.com, Tucker Carlson warns elites are making things
[1:38:27.920 --> 1:38:32.240]  worse on purpose, yes, driving us into submission.
[1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:35.560]  California activates four gas generators for the first time as electric grid sufferers
[1:38:35.560 --> 1:38:40.520]  major defeat because that's because they overdid it, now they just want to have a control
[1:38:40.520 --> 1:38:44.360]  collapse when they've got to supply government buildings.
[1:38:44.360 --> 1:38:48.040]  Energy secretary, California is the lead, it's the example of what we're going to do
[1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:56.360]  in the rest of the country and it goes on and on and on.
[1:38:56.360 --> 1:39:01.040]  And what happened when California said use less power, just like when they said don't
[1:39:01.040 --> 1:39:04.400]  get too much toilet paper, everybody went out and bought it, people are now turning
[1:39:04.400 --> 1:39:12.720]  the thermostat down even lower because they've turned the public into what they are themselves.
[1:39:12.720 --> 1:39:18.320]  And now they're coming for your car and they're not going to ever produce enough electric
[1:39:18.320 --> 1:39:21.080]  vehicles, they're not going to have powerful electric vehicles, they just want you to understand
[1:39:21.080 --> 1:39:24.840]  as they get rid of your cars, oh, we're doing it with this new replacement but there is
[1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:25.840]  no replacement.
[1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:31.240]  They told us they were just getting rid of your cars, you wouldn't put up with it.
[1:39:31.240 --> 1:39:35.280]  But what else do we have here on the stack that ties into all this?
[1:39:35.280 --> 1:39:40.080]  We have video of the line at one of the water distribution centers this morning in Jackson
[1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:44.040]  Mississippi, the government said they can't comply with the new federal regulations on
[1:39:44.040 --> 1:39:50.400]  water plants, the Bill Gates helped right, and so you just won't have running water
[1:39:50.400 --> 1:39:57.320]  anymore, not water you've got to boil but you just won't have running water maybe forever
[1:39:57.320 --> 1:40:05.040]  they say, and then Australia falling in line, major banks now rolling out the National ID
[1:40:05.040 --> 1:40:11.200]  app linking it to all information in one easy access file accessing your government, accessible
[1:40:11.200 --> 1:40:15.080]  to government to smile on you, your vaccine passport didn't set you free, it opened the
[1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:16.080]  door to tyranny.
[1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:23.200]  You can go see the video on that right there on screen, but let's go to what I mentioned
[1:40:23.200 --> 1:40:27.640]  because unlike mainstream news, when we make an accusation, we show it, here's the economic
[1:40:27.640 --> 1:40:33.440]  minister, the head of the economy, Minister Hobbock, can imagine parts of the economy
[1:40:33.440 --> 1:40:39.920]  will simply stop producing for the time being, and who is it, fraffed businesses, the evil
[1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:48.120]  ones, small restaurants, children's nurseries, plant nurseries, small farms, overbending
[1:40:48.120 --> 1:40:53.160]  your cows, get the picture now, all out war against the little guy, here he is.
[1:40:53.160 --> 1:40:57.880]  But do you expect a wave of insolvency at the end of this winter?
[1:40:57.880 --> 1:41:09.840]  No, I don't do that, I can imagine that certain branches simply stop producing, not insolvent
[1:41:09.840 --> 1:41:14.560]  will, but I mean, at the moment I can't afford to buy any of that.
[1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:17.840]  But do you expect a wave of insolvency at the end of this winter?
[1:41:17.840 --> 1:41:29.880]  No, I don't do that, I can imagine that certain branches simply stop producing, not insolvent
[1:41:29.880 --> 1:41:30.880]  will.
[1:41:30.880 --> 1:41:34.560]  And again, he goes on to say universal basic income, and it's only going to be the craft
[1:41:34.560 --> 1:41:43.280]  businesses, the small ones, and yeah, you don't need to have restaurants, you don't need to
[1:41:43.280 --> 1:41:47.360]  have your house cleaned, you don't need to have your clothes cleaned, you're getting
[1:41:47.360 --> 1:41:53.160]  rid of it all, folks, because you're non-essential, the exact same attack you saw with the covid
[1:41:53.160 --> 1:41:57.400]  hokes, the covid fraud, the covid power grab, now you see it again, they're hitting you
[1:41:57.400 --> 1:42:01.040]  with poison shots, they're hitting you with open borders, they're hitting you with shipping
[1:42:01.040 --> 1:42:06.640]  drugs in, they're hitting you promoting pedophilia, they're at war with you, this is a new type
[1:42:06.640 --> 1:42:12.480]  of war, an extermination war, and then once the whole economy collapses and your universal
[1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:16.440]  basic income won't buy anything anymore, then you're sent to forced labor camps, which
[1:42:16.440 --> 1:42:22.280]  they're building all over the world, covid centers and emergency centers, they set in
[1:42:22.280 --> 1:42:26.120]  Australia and Canada this year, you know, we may use these for political distance, we
[1:42:26.120 --> 1:42:31.920]  may use these during economic collapse, so oh, it's a covid camp, now it's a camp, concentration
[1:42:31.920 --> 1:42:39.320]  camps being built everywhere, it's really happening, there's really men and women sports,
[1:42:39.320 --> 1:42:44.520]  there's really satanism being promoted, this is a real evil takeover, the bad guys are
[1:42:44.520 --> 1:42:51.800]  in control, we're going to come back and tie it in, the latest economic news, military

[1:45:58.560 --> 1:46:04.600]  Our world is so full of hype, we are force fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate
[1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:10.160]  media, by the controlled churches and the universities and why is this the case?
[1:46:10.160 --> 1:46:15.040]  Because we innately, by God, have been given the keys for our own minds, our own psyche,
[1:46:15.040 --> 1:46:21.320]  our own souls and by connecting to God we can empower ourselves and transcend the quote
[1:46:21.320 --> 1:46:23.640]  fallen or sinful state.
[1:46:23.640 --> 1:46:28.800]  So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to
[1:46:28.800 --> 1:46:33.960]  change who we are are only lowering us, they're only making us more depressed and in the end
[1:46:33.960 --> 1:46:35.560]  they're only making us less fulfilled.
[1:46:35.560 --> 1:46:40.720]  It is only by going within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower
[1:46:40.720 --> 1:46:41.720]  ourselves.
[1:46:41.720 --> 1:46:45.920]  That's why the globalist, bombardist, and toxins and chemicals to block us getting the
[1:46:45.920 --> 1:46:51.360]  normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able
[1:46:51.360 --> 1:46:53.920]  to basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[1:46:53.920 --> 1:46:59.240]  And that's where the incredible products come in at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:25.240]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:43.240]  Why are the globalists so obsessed with human sacrifice of children and pedophilia?
[1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:47.560]  He's done a big historical research on it and I was thinking about him a few weeks ago
[1:47:47.560 --> 1:47:51.880]  and a lot of mainstream news was admitting this and saying that humans were going back
[1:47:51.880 --> 1:47:55.760]  to this and the cannibalism is coming back, the New York Times and others were saying
[1:47:55.760 --> 1:47:57.600]  how wonderful this is.
[1:47:57.600 --> 1:47:59.800]  Why does this happen throughout history over and over again?
[1:47:59.800 --> 1:48:00.800]  What is the cycle?
[1:48:00.800 --> 1:48:04.160]  And why do the establishment so-called elites push it?
[1:48:04.160 --> 1:48:07.840]  That's coming up next hour.
[1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:12.840]  But let me continue with the design collapse of civilization and how the globalists are
[1:48:12.840 --> 1:48:17.040]  multinationalists and are shutting down Europe and the United States and the U.K. and Australia
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:18.040]  and Zealand.
[1:48:18.040 --> 1:48:25.000]  U.S. losing dominance as Asia clout grows, Russia boots sovereignty, highlights of Putin's
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  EEF speech.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  That's what's happening.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:31.680]  Russia is making record profits right now, we're collapsing.
[1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:37.200]  Civilian military relations under extreme strain, former Pentagon leader says, as Americans
[1:48:37.200 --> 1:48:40.600]  turn against the military, it's now seen as a woke instrument of tyranny.
[1:48:40.600 --> 1:48:44.040]  Our military is not bad, the people running it are bad, but this is part of the divide
[1:48:44.040 --> 1:48:45.040]  and conquer plan.
[1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:49.320]  Their police aren't bad, it's the policies that are bad and then when the cops do bad
[1:48:49.320 --> 1:48:53.440]  things under policy, they try to blame the average cop to put even more globalist control
[1:48:53.440 --> 1:48:54.440]  in.
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:58.360]  Here's an example of what I mentioned earlier, the power outages by design.
[1:48:58.360 --> 1:49:02.880]  Austin Berksham International Airport loses power, cancelling flights and frustrating flyers.
[1:49:02.880 --> 1:49:07.080]  They know there's not enough power generation, they've been cutting it off in Texas, California
[1:49:07.080 --> 1:49:13.000]  and every other state for at least a decade under Obama and then the bureaucracy tried
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:16.360]  to continue under Trump, but Trump slowed it.
[1:49:16.360 --> 1:49:26.560]  Now in the last 20 months under Biden, it has gone into overdrive, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:49:26.560 --> 1:49:29.800]  Absolute total complete overdrive.
[1:49:29.800 --> 1:49:35.680]  These are all simulation tests to train everybody to accept this.
[1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:39.880]  All the critical infrastructure electricity stays on.
[1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:44.560]  So that's where our world is on that front.
[1:49:44.560 --> 1:49:49.320]  The good news is Americans are waking up a big national poll.
[1:49:49.320 --> 1:49:54.040]  Majority believe Bidens make America great again, extremist speech, a dangerous escalation
[1:49:54.040 --> 1:49:57.240]  rhetoric designed to incite conflict, close quote.
[1:49:57.240 --> 1:50:02.760]  So people really understand what Operation Matador is and then we've got Kathy Griffin
[1:50:02.760 --> 1:50:08.560]  warned Civil War if voters elect Republicans November says they're going to attack.
[1:50:08.560 --> 1:50:13.480]  It's always these people that are self-appointed to run our lives and you think cutting the
[1:50:13.480 --> 1:50:17.040]  power is off, you think cutting the power off is bold.
[1:50:17.040 --> 1:50:19.720]  Look at all this news.
[1:50:19.720 --> 1:50:27.400]  Americans demand answers to blood clot crisis expanding nationwide and we've got statistics
[1:50:27.400 --> 1:50:33.200]  of every western country taking Moderna, Pfizer, J&J and AstraZeneca shots because they're
[1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:38.880]  all designed to do the same thing causing massive blood clots, heart attacks, myocarditis,
[1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:40.960]  strokes, you name it.
[1:50:40.960 --> 1:50:45.600]  Americans demand answers to blood clot crisis expanding nationwide.
[1:50:45.600 --> 1:50:50.400]  As high school athletes, college athletes, young people drop dead in massive numbers.
[1:50:50.400 --> 1:50:55.360]  U.S. district court orders Biden officials to turn over big tech collusion docs including
[1:50:55.360 --> 1:50:56.360]  Dr. Fauci.
[1:50:56.360 --> 1:50:58.480]  Now you can say big tech has a right to censor.
[1:50:58.480 --> 1:51:05.160]  They really don't because they've got section of law that makes them a utility which gives
[1:51:05.160 --> 1:51:11.240]  them immunity from lawsuits.
[1:51:11.240 --> 1:51:14.680]  But you can't collude with the government on what you're going to censor, example the
[1:51:14.680 --> 1:51:18.120]  Hunter Biden laptop and the FBI said, oh, we censor all the time.
[1:51:18.120 --> 1:51:20.080]  We tell them what to censor all the time.
[1:51:20.080 --> 1:51:25.320]  That's our job controlling what Americans say, what Americans do.
[1:51:25.320 --> 1:51:30.000]  Now this is the unbelievable crossroads we're at, I mentioned this yesterday but I just
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  want to go back to this because this really illustrates everything.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:38.920]  I saw this in the Chicago Tribune and I found it hard to believe so I went and pulled up
[1:51:38.920 --> 1:51:44.240]  the legislation that's law that was put into law last year and that was going into effect
[1:51:44.240 --> 1:51:49.880]  in Illinois, non-detainable offenses under the safety act which is in line with Soros
[1:51:49.880 --> 1:51:53.720]  and prosecutors he's put in around the country, right here in Austin, up in Fort Worth, Texas.
[1:51:53.720 --> 1:51:59.920]  They put in the district attorney and remember that young black man, 16 years old, shot three
[1:51:59.920 --> 1:52:04.840]  other people, wounding them at the school, he was let out of jail the next morning and
[1:52:04.840 --> 1:52:10.480]  they said, well, we have a program where minorities don't get prosecuted.
[1:52:10.480 --> 1:52:12.200]  That's real story.
[1:52:12.200 --> 1:52:16.920]  Same thing happens in Austin, it's not to protect black people, it's to create lawlessness.
[1:52:16.920 --> 1:52:21.560]  Non-detainable offenses under the safety act, second degree murder, you're released without
[1:52:21.560 --> 1:52:28.640]  bond the next day, drug-induced homicide, killing somebody with a drug, you give them.
[1:52:28.640 --> 1:52:31.880]  Arson, hey, burn somebody's house down, that's not a big deal, you saw the mostly peaceful
[1:52:31.880 --> 1:52:36.960]  protest, two million dollars in damage plus, aggravated battery, kidnapping, hey, what's
[1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:43.720]  wrong with kidnapping, burglary, robbery, intimidation, aggravated DUI, aggravated fleeing and eluding,
[1:52:43.720 --> 1:52:47.000]  drug offenses, threatening a public official and the list goes on and on.
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:55.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, here is the legislation, the safety act, ICJIA, now law in Illinois,
[1:52:55.800 --> 1:52:59.920]  that's Soros in control of your government and yeah, that doesn't sound real, does it?
[1:52:59.920 --> 1:53:03.880]  Like government purposely shutting down power plants or power outages or government opening
[1:53:03.880 --> 1:53:09.000]  up the borders allowing giant child smuggling or the government, I see it all the time,
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:16.520]  releasing people caught with pounds of fentanyl and I know people, a lot of people that have
[1:53:16.520 --> 1:53:24.320]  died from fentanyl, but it's all just done in your face because they're killing us with
[1:53:24.320 --> 1:53:28.080]  poisoned shots, of course they're turning the power off, of course they're dissolving
[1:53:28.080 --> 1:53:31.760]  the borders, of course they're promoting drag queen pedophile time because they are at
[1:53:31.760 --> 1:53:40.960]  war with us and are bringing down the civilization to force an apocalyptic population collapse
[1:53:40.960 --> 1:53:46.480]  and imagine being the average moron going along with this, but what's worse is imagine
[1:53:46.480 --> 1:53:51.400]  being a power structure member who thinks you're going to get more control and power
[1:53:51.400 --> 1:53:59.680]  out of this when 99.999% of people are going to be destroyed by this and what elite would
[1:53:59.680 --> 1:54:04.960]  want to get rid of checks and balances and do process when authoritarian regimes always
[1:54:04.960 --> 1:54:10.760]  start overthrowing the bosses and then there's a cascade of the bosses being overthrown and
[1:54:10.760 --> 1:54:14.440]  that creates even more instability, that's why they operate from globalist committee
[1:54:14.440 --> 1:54:21.280]  so there's never anybody too powerful, but that's not going to work out either.
[1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:28.240]  This is a nightmare takeover, I mean this is such a horrible situation and it makes my
[1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:36.960]  head spin that we're in the middle of this, but what everybody needs to know is the social
[1:54:36.960 --> 1:54:41.480]  contract, we all work together for a better good, it's been broken by design, now they
[1:54:41.480 --> 1:54:47.640]  use the remnants of the social contract or some vague religious belief in it to do what
[1:54:47.640 --> 1:54:51.680]  you're told, stay in your house, wear a mask, turn down your thermostat, get rid of your
[1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:59.000]  car, don't go on vacation, we have a complex economy designed for all of the fun things
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:04.920]  we do, it doesn't hurt the environment on average, but by them saying it hurts the
[1:55:04.920 --> 1:55:08.280]  environment it gives them the moral authority to decide who can operate a business, who
[1:55:08.280 --> 1:55:13.520]  can travel, who can live and they admit that's the plan, that's why it's more important than
[1:55:13.520 --> 1:55:17.720]  ever to support independent media, that's why it's more important than ever to support
[1:55:17.720 --> 1:55:22.840]  local grassroots mom and pop businesses, that's why you should go out of your way to eat a
[1:55:22.840 --> 1:55:27.160]  mom and pop or go to a small cleaners or go to a small maid service or go to a small hair
[1:55:27.160 --> 1:55:33.840]  cutting place, we've all got to stop using big corporations as much as possible because
[1:55:33.840 --> 1:55:38.360]  they're not trying to make money, they're trying to create a monopoly for social control,

[2:00:12.920 --> 2:00:18.960]  Is China sending drone swarms to spy on militaries around the world?
[2:00:18.960 --> 2:00:24.840]  According to the war zone publication, the US Navy has finally released video footage
[2:00:24.840 --> 2:00:31.800]  of an incident from 2019 where six unidentified drones flew over its most advanced surface
[2:00:31.800 --> 2:00:38.360]  combatant, the USS Salt, while it was in international waters 17 miles off the coast
[2:00:38.360 --> 2:00:46.480]  of Southern California. At approximately 8.30pm on April 24, 2019, at least six unknown unmanned
[2:00:46.480 --> 2:00:52.360]  aerial systems were seen from 300 to 1,000 feet above the naval ship.
[2:00:52.360 --> 2:00:59.120]  Drone security specialist David Kovar described the flying objects as long range quad drones
[2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:04.120]  with regularly spaced running lights, adding that they could be gasoline powered with the
[2:01:04.120 --> 2:01:09.280]  ability to land and take off vertically, most likely launched from a boat. He says
[2:01:09.280 --> 2:01:15.640]  these types of aircraft are a favorite of the Chinese Navy. Is China probing for a drone
[2:01:15.640 --> 2:01:22.040]  attack or just gathering intel? In fact, during the early months of 2019, there were more
[2:01:22.040 --> 2:01:28.240]  than half a dozen similar incidents where drones swarms US naval vessels off the coast
[2:01:28.240 --> 2:01:33.480]  of Southern California, one of which was a surveillance operation launched from a cargo
[2:01:33.480 --> 2:01:39.000]  ship called the Bass Strait, which is owned and operated out of Hong Kong. During the
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:44.720]  incident, the cargo ship was unsuccessfully contacted by the US naval vessel. In all of
[2:01:44.720 --> 2:01:50.120]  these encounters, the drone swarm flies in a triangle formation with running lights underneath
[2:01:50.120 --> 2:01:55.360]  each unmanned drone. The drones were assessed to be conducting collection operations on
[2:01:55.360 --> 2:02:00.760]  the naval ships. These incidents involving multiple drones have increased significantly
[2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:08.520]  worldwide since 2019, raising the alarm. On April 5, 2021, the chief of naval operations
[2:02:08.520 --> 2:02:14.400]  Admiral Michael Gilday stated in regards to drone swarms that, quote, there have been
[2:02:14.400 --> 2:02:20.280]  other sightings by aviators in the air and by other ships, not only of the United States,
[2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:26.440]  but of other nations. Clearly, the US Navy is concerned about swarms of drones launched
[2:02:26.440 --> 2:02:33.000]  from international waters. Just in July of 2022, the Naval Surface Warfare Center ran
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:41.040]  an event called Silent Swarm 22, a large-scale experimentation event that focused on electromagnetic
[2:02:41.040 --> 2:02:48.040]  warfare employed on small domain unmanned systems. In other words, drones. The logo for
[2:02:48.040 --> 2:02:55.080]  their event even includes drones swarming a US naval ship. 150 participants from multiple
[2:02:55.080 --> 2:03:00.520]  Department of Defense agencies conducted the exercise for over two weeks, with more than
[2:03:00.520 --> 2:03:07.680]  17 technologies and electromagnetic spectrum-related capabilities. Because aside from spying, these
[2:03:07.680 --> 2:03:13.960]  drones could be used as the delivery system for an electromagnetic pulse attack, or worse.
[2:03:13.960 --> 2:03:19.520]  Sonora Laughlin, the deputy project lead, stated, quote, at this event, we want to create
[2:03:19.520 --> 2:03:25.060]  an environment that allows positive and constructive testing of emerging technologies for those
[2:03:25.060 --> 2:03:30.920]  in the future war fight. As she said, the US Navy and Department of Defense are preparing
[2:03:30.920 --> 2:03:36.520]  for drone warfare in the near future, and this type of war will be fought with China.
[2:03:36.520 --> 2:03:41.760]  It only makes sense that the culprit behind these drone swarms is China, given that just
[2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:47.480]  this week, Taiwan's military shot down a drone hovering over one of its island outposts
[2:03:47.480 --> 2:03:52.880]  just off the Chinese coast after it entered restricted airspace over Taiwan. Following
[2:03:52.880 --> 2:03:58.920]  a series of flares and warning shots, the drone maintained its position, so it was finally
[2:03:58.920 --> 2:04:04.200]  shot down by the Taiwanese military. Just the day before this incident, Taiwan claims
[2:04:04.200 --> 2:04:09.560]  it warned off drones hovering over three of its islands off the coast of the Chinese port
[2:04:09.560 --> 2:04:16.520]  city of Xiamen. The state-run South China Morning Post claims that the drone was a civilian-operated
[2:04:16.520 --> 2:04:21.960]  drone. However, it seems far more likely that it belonged to the Chinese military, and was
[2:04:21.960 --> 2:04:27.320]  collecting intelligence on Taiwan and its naval defense capabilities. Will a future
[2:04:27.320 --> 2:04:33.840]  Chinese invasion of Taiwan begin with drone swarms? And what does China have in mind for
[2:04:33.840 --> 2:04:40.240]  the West Coast of the United States? An EMP attack before a land invasion? Or will the
[2:04:40.240 --> 2:04:47.120]  US Navy only be stunned to prevent any serious interference with their conquering of Taiwan?
[2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:54.120]  At least one thing is for sure, these drone swarms are definitely not UFOs, they're Chinese,
[2:04:54.120 --> 2:04:57.280]  and they're up to something. This is Brian Wilson with...
[2:04:57.280 --> 2:05:05.280]  The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass

[2:06:01.280 --> 2:06:20.720]  You've found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show.
[2:06:20.720 --> 2:06:25.760]  John Urban is an author and researcher and he's really one of the guys at the beginning
[2:06:25.760 --> 2:06:33.800]  of Joe Rogan's podcast, we're talking 12, 15 years ago, to get Joe into psychedelics.
[2:06:33.800 --> 2:06:38.400]  When I first knew Joe, he didn't even smoke marijuana, done Joe 25 years, he was any
[2:06:38.400 --> 2:06:42.200]  problem that got him into marijuana, and Joe would work out like four hours a day. And
[2:06:42.200 --> 2:06:47.880]  the story is about Joe Rogan, it's just interesting that John Urban was big into hallucinogens,
[2:06:47.880 --> 2:06:53.040]  so he can definitely tell you the dark side of these, and historically when I've read
[2:06:53.040 --> 2:06:57.840]  his book and when I've seen the information, I know it's true because it's actually part
[2:06:57.840 --> 2:07:05.280]  of the historical record. And so when I thought of him, I wanted to get him on a couple of
[2:07:05.280 --> 2:07:11.000]  weeks ago, there was suddenly a bunch of articles in mainstream news about all these civilizations
[2:07:11.000 --> 2:07:17.280]  that ended when they started taking hallucinogens, and how suddenly they believed God's were
[2:07:17.280 --> 2:07:25.400]  telling them sacrifice your children, particularly first born boys, exclusive ancient child sacrifice
[2:07:25.400 --> 2:07:32.320]  maybe world's largest national geographic in Mexico, mainly boys. Feeding the gods,
[2:07:32.320 --> 2:07:37.840]  hundreds of skulls reveal massive scale of human sacrifice. And they've dug up giant
[2:07:37.840 --> 2:07:43.120]  areas all over Germany and France, where there'll be hundreds of thousands of bodies that have
[2:07:43.120 --> 2:07:52.040]  been eaten. Ritual drug use during Inca human sacrifices, Peru. Our Gordon Wasson will teach
[2:07:52.040 --> 2:07:57.160]  you about all this, remains of vampire pinned to the ground with a sickle across her throat
[2:07:57.160 --> 2:08:03.040]  found in Poland, all ties together the druids, every culture, whether it was Mesoamerican,
[2:08:03.040 --> 2:08:08.160]  European, ancient Asians, Africans, they would all build a civilization suddenly this group
[2:08:08.160 --> 2:08:15.400]  would take over of shaman, they were on drugs, and things would then accelerate into pyramids,
[2:08:15.400 --> 2:08:20.160]  mass sacrifice, death, and they believe these gods, the snake god, which clock called Potol
[2:08:20.160 --> 2:08:25.320]  by pronouncing it right, we're telling him to do this. Now, I read his book online a
[2:08:25.320 --> 2:08:31.680]  while back, I've got a copy of the cover here, God's flesh, tie on Nana, Katal, I pronounced
[2:08:31.680 --> 2:08:37.760]  that right, the true history of the sacred mushroom, JR Erwin. And the reason this is
[2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:42.760]  important is, the Vikings, where they would get possessed and become berserkers were
[2:08:42.760 --> 2:08:47.800]  taking it as well. In fact, it was a new movie came out a few months ago, I saw it was pretty
[2:08:47.800 --> 2:08:52.240]  good called Northman, and it was all about, they were taking so many hallucinogens on
[2:08:52.240 --> 2:08:57.720]  a regular basis, they were not even living in reality. And human sacrifice there. And
[2:08:57.720 --> 2:09:02.920]  so to talk about it is, John Erwin, who I've talked to many times over the phone, I saw
[2:09:02.920 --> 2:09:07.960]  him over a decade ago in Joe Rogan, I've watched some of his shows since then. And I wanted
[2:09:07.960 --> 2:09:11.800]  to get him on as someone that used to be a big proponent of this, and how he found the
[2:09:11.800 --> 2:09:15.800]  dark side of it, and how he found the way out of it, and where he sees this all going.
[2:09:15.800 --> 2:09:18.680]  So John, great to have you with us, sir.
[2:09:18.680 --> 2:09:21.200]  Thanks Alec, thanks for having me back.
[2:09:21.200 --> 2:09:27.200]  You bet, you've been on the show too, I forgot that. So let's get right into it here.
[2:09:27.200 --> 2:09:34.600]  Yeah, you know, so basically, you know, starting back over a decade ago, I started realizing
[2:09:34.600 --> 2:09:40.320]  that psychedelics were being promoted to the public under the CIA's MKUltra Subproject
[2:09:40.320 --> 2:09:50.280]  58 program. And the start of that was in 1957 in Life Magazine, in an article called
[2:09:50.280 --> 2:09:56.080]  Seeking the Magic Mushroom, and then a decade later that kicks off the psychedelic revolution
[2:09:56.080 --> 2:10:01.680]  with the summer of love and all of this stuff. But, you know, so I started realizing that
[2:10:01.680 --> 2:10:06.600]  the whole thing was surrounding, as far as the counterculture was surrounded by this
[2:10:06.600 --> 2:10:12.400]  MKUltra Subproject 58 program. So a couple of months ago, I published this book, there's
[2:10:12.400 --> 2:10:20.560]  some glare going on there. But it goes through all of the original documentation from the
[2:10:20.560 --> 2:10:27.760]  colonial era, from the Spanish, from the Aztecs themselves, from French reports, from anything
[2:10:27.760 --> 2:10:36.840]  that I could find. And it shows how all of the original religious practice was surrounded
[2:10:36.840 --> 2:10:44.680]  with human sacrifice and cannibalism. And that's Gordon Wasson, Professor Carl Ruck,
[2:10:44.680 --> 2:10:50.520]  Jonathan Ott, Jeremy Bigwood, some of these other guys, Terrence McKinnon, etc. They all
[2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:58.400]  covered up the true history and created a New Age mushroom religion that never existed
[2:10:58.400 --> 2:11:02.600]  before May 13, 1957.
[2:11:02.600 --> 2:11:10.960]  And from your research, and I concur, it was a reboot of these ancient systems.
[2:11:10.960 --> 2:11:15.880]  Even worse, I mean, so if we look at like Burning Man, or, you know, if you remember
[2:11:15.880 --> 2:11:27.120]  the 1973 film Wicker Man, or the 2019 film Midsomer, they're showing how it's all leading
[2:11:27.120 --> 2:11:33.880]  back to human sacrifice and cannibalism. That's what Burning Man is. It's a mock human sacrifice.
[2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:38.680]  And who knows, you know, a lot of years at Burning Man, people have jumped into the fire
[2:11:38.680 --> 2:11:45.640]  and sacrificed themselves at the burning of the big statue that they make, etc. So, you
[2:11:45.640 --> 2:11:51.320]  know, we're actually seeing the slow progression. You know, first, you know, and Aldous Huxley
[2:11:51.320 --> 2:11:57.200]  and Timothy Leary in their writings, they clearly state that they want to destroy Christianity
[2:11:57.200 --> 2:12:04.520]  and bring back this ancient religion. Now, most people have the false notion that the
[2:12:04.520 --> 2:12:11.240]  Christians went around and destroyed these wonderful peace, peace, love, proto hippie
[2:12:11.240 --> 2:12:19.280]  type pagan religions. And when in reality, if you go in and you look at the historical
[2:12:19.280 --> 2:12:26.400]  documentation from all over the world, it was about human sacrifice and cannibalism.
[2:12:26.400 --> 2:12:32.000]  So all of this history has been covered up and buried. You can dig through, you can get
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:38.720]  ahold of the original 16th century Spanish reports, what the Aztecs wrote themselves
[2:12:38.720 --> 2:12:47.320]  and like the Florentine Codex, etc. And they openly talk about the human sacrifice as well
[2:12:47.320 --> 2:12:54.920]  as the cannibalism. In fact, page one of book two of the Florentine Codex talks about sacrificing
[2:12:54.920 --> 2:13:01.960]  young children to the rain and water god Tlaloc. And what they would do is try to get the children
[2:13:01.960 --> 2:13:06.680]  to cry on the way to be sacrificed. And if the children cried, they knew it would be
[2:13:06.680 --> 2:13:12.500]  a good rain year. And so, you know, and then what they would do is they would roll the
[2:13:12.500 --> 2:13:19.200]  bodies down the temple and then cannibalize them afterwards, often while high on psychedelic
[2:13:19.200 --> 2:13:20.200]  mushrooms.
[2:13:20.200 --> 2:13:22.760]  By the way, if you go to Chichin Itzab and they're like five times in Mexico, they give
[2:13:22.760 --> 2:13:27.640]  you a tour. And it's Mayan historians that have archaeology degrees. And they'll tell
[2:13:27.640 --> 2:13:32.760]  you they have a little market below the main temple. And they said they would take the meat
[2:13:32.760 --> 2:13:37.200]  of the dead people and the priest class would sell that meat in the market.
[2:13:37.200 --> 2:13:43.920]  Yep. 100% true. And, you know, and a lot of times, you know, the peasant people couldn't
[2:13:43.920 --> 2:13:52.600]  afford the meat. So it'd be reserved often for the merchant class as well as the priest
[2:13:52.600 --> 2:13:59.440]  and elite class. So, you know, this was a massive system in 2015. And you showed a little
[2:13:59.440 --> 2:14:08.560]  bit of it on there. But in Science Magazine in 2015, they, or scientists discovered in
[2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:17.440]  2015 that a massive temple buried underneath Mexico City. And they found that the temple
[2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:27.960]  holds upwards of 130,000 human skulls, mainly warriors, but also women and children. And,
[2:14:27.960 --> 2:14:35.560]  you know, so when the Spanish rolled into Mexico, what is now Mexico City in 1517, you
[2:14:35.560 --> 2:14:40.720]  know, they were shocked by what they saw. You know, and part of it was that the Aztecs
[2:14:40.720 --> 2:14:50.600]  used this for psychological control, for fear. Part of it was dominating their enemy cultures.
[2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:55.360]  They would have war parties and people say, well, how would they come up with all of these
[2:14:55.360 --> 2:15:02.920]  people to sacrifice? They would intentionally go to war with neighboring tribes and to capture
[2:15:02.920 --> 2:15:08.640]  their warriors to make them slaves. They would call them bathed slaves. They would pamper
[2:15:08.640 --> 2:15:15.760]  them for a few months, maybe a couple of few years, and then sacrifice them on the sunstone,
[2:15:15.760 --> 2:15:16.760]  cut out their heart.
[2:15:16.760 --> 2:15:20.400]  Exactly. If you go to the ball court and chitchat in some other areas with all the skulls
[2:15:20.400 --> 2:15:25.200]  carved in, the winners got to get sacrificed. That's how mind controlled they were. So you
[2:15:25.200 --> 2:15:27.000]  wanted to be sacrificed.
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:33.960]  Yeah. Well, you know, and there is evidence that a lot of these slaves had to be drugged
[2:15:33.960 --> 2:15:41.880]  to be sacrificed. But, you know, so when Cortez rolls into Mexico, many of the surrounding
[2:15:41.880 --> 2:15:47.240]  tribes were fed up and they offer Christianity instead of human sacrifice. And look, you
[2:15:47.240 --> 2:15:50.800]  know, you follow logos, you follow Christ,
[2:15:50.800 --> 2:15:58.120]  John, stay there. Let's come right back with that on the other side. Stay with us.
[2:15:58.120 --> 2:16:02.920]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular

[2:16:08.480 --> 2:16:16.520]  is the fact that it has natural psychotropic effects. It certainly does for me. I take
[2:16:16.520 --> 2:16:22.240]  a couple of these capsules an hour before bed. My sleep, my dreams are amazing. Now
[2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:28.120]  there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain.

[2:16:57.640 --> 2:17:02.920]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing
[2:17:02.920 --> 2:17:08.520]  with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[2:17:08.520 --> 2:17:14.800]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarsstore.com. Studies have
[2:17:14.800 --> 2:17:20.720]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[2:17:20.720 --> 2:17:26.320]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction
[2:17:26.320 --> 2:17:32.800]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested
[2:17:32.800 --> 2:17:39.880]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[2:17:39.880 --> 2:17:46.040]  and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and
[2:17:46.040 --> 2:17:52.440]  calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for
[2:17:52.440 --> 2:17:56.960]  a friend, family member or yourself at infowarsstore.com.
[2:17:56.960 --> 2:18:03.760]  Donald Trump and the Martin Republicans represented extremism that threatens the very foundations
[2:18:03.760 --> 2:18:10.000]  of our republic. I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't have an operational name. In
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:15.280]  fact, I bet it does. I bet it's called Operation Matador. They see us as the bull and they
[2:18:15.280 --> 2:18:22.520]  are shaky, a red flag in our face and the Matador is the deep state with a long skinny
[2:18:22.520 --> 2:18:28.160]  razor shark sword so that when the bull lunges forward, the Matador uses the force of its
[2:18:28.160 --> 2:18:34.000]  weight to drive it into the heart and step aside with its cape as the bull buries himself
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:39.000]  into the dust. They've got the ace of spades in their hand, which is false flags. Before
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:43.560]  you launch a war, you stage false flags. That's the first thing you do because nobody wants
[2:18:43.560 --> 2:18:48.040]  to say they started a war. Bad guys start wars. So every time a war gets launched by
[2:18:48.040 --> 2:18:57.040]  bad guys, they stage an event. This is Operation Matador.
[2:18:57.040 --> 2:19:01.680]  The eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans. They financed
[2:19:01.680 --> 2:19:07.480]  major universities. They ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda
[2:19:07.480 --> 2:19:13.040]  of the New York Times, other major newspapers, that the family, as we know it, is a bad thing
[2:19:13.040 --> 2:19:18.480]  and must be ended. And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching
[2:19:18.480 --> 2:19:22.760]  women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is
[2:19:22.760 --> 2:19:28.040]  a bad thing. And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four national
[2:19:28.040 --> 2:19:32.280]  daughter. My wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well. I love to make
[2:19:32.280 --> 2:19:36.360]  breakfast. And literally, it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family
[2:19:36.360 --> 2:19:41.920]  and be nurturative and then all sit down together and have the communal event. And that's what
[2:19:41.920 --> 2:19:47.880]  the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions and coming together.
[2:19:47.880 --> 2:19:53.520]  They really are sick, evil, scientific cult of filth and want to domesticate us and turn
[2:19:53.520 --> 2:19:58.240]  us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue.
[2:19:58.240 --> 2:20:25.800]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:25.800 --> 2:20:38.280]  John Urban is our guest expert on psychedelics and the occult. In this relaunch of the occult
[2:20:38.280 --> 2:20:42.920]  revolution, the Bible says that in ancient times, all these different cultures got into
[2:20:42.920 --> 2:20:49.240]  pharmacia or witchcraft or sorcery and it was drugs. That's why you call it the pharmacy.
[2:20:49.240 --> 2:20:54.120]  And the whole New World Order is about drugging us to put us in a different consciousness state
[2:20:54.120 --> 2:21:00.120]  so we can be programmed. So you're drilling into the Aztecs in that big angle. But we've
[2:21:00.120 --> 2:21:04.320]  talked on the phone, you've been a guest before. I want you to take your time this hour to
[2:21:04.320 --> 2:21:09.040]  drill into whatever you want to. But first, give us a 35,000-foot view and give us your
[2:21:09.040 --> 2:21:14.040]  hypothesis about what's going on. It's not really a hypothesis it's admitted. But as
[2:21:14.040 --> 2:21:18.720]  a hypothesis, give us a 35,000-foot view and then drill into what's going on. I think
[2:21:18.720 --> 2:21:22.680]  most startlers know about the Aztecs, the occult. You're getting into Cortez with less
[2:21:22.680 --> 2:21:26.920]  than 300 men showing up and then Mexico City collapses in a matter of days because people
[2:21:26.920 --> 2:21:31.320]  are so sick of the Satanism and the insanity and how drugged up everybody was. It was like
[2:21:31.320 --> 2:21:34.520]  a blue city. Everybody was actually against it. They were just being liberated. That's
[2:21:34.520 --> 2:21:39.320]  an important thing to finish historically. But then give us the 35,000-foot view and
[2:21:39.320 --> 2:21:40.960]  then where this is all going.
[2:21:40.960 --> 2:21:46.840]  Sure. Yeah, so just to finish up when Cortez arrived, so many of the surrounding tribes
[2:21:46.840 --> 2:21:54.200]  were sick of Montezuma and what the Aztec or Mejica were doing. They joined up with
[2:21:54.200 --> 2:22:07.320]  Cortez and helped him overthrow what is now Mexico City and the Mejica. The official history
[2:22:07.320 --> 2:22:11.880]  is that when the Spanish got there, they just wiped out all of these pagan cultures and
[2:22:11.880 --> 2:22:18.840]  massacred millions of people. It's totally false. People can go in and read the Inquisition
[2:22:18.840 --> 2:22:28.040]  records today. Most of them are about rape, pedophilia, incest, murder, things like this
[2:22:28.040 --> 2:22:38.640]  and the people that got sentenced. In 1539, one guy was put to death for sacrificing a
[2:22:38.640 --> 2:22:44.440]  young boy, an incest, and attempted rape. The Inquisitions were immediately halted and
[2:22:44.440 --> 2:22:49.320]  you don't even hear about this kind of stuff.
[2:22:49.320 --> 2:22:58.800]  From the 35,000-foot view, what they're doing is trying to recreate the fall of humanity.
[2:22:58.800 --> 2:23:08.240]  Bringing us back to this human sacrifice, cannibalism, drug-induced state, Aldous Huxley's
[2:23:08.240 --> 2:23:18.960]  Brave New World. Of course, he was a key architect behind MKUltra. They used frauds like Terrence
[2:23:18.960 --> 2:23:24.160]  McKenna to get out there and promote the false narrative. Terrence McKenna admitted that
[2:23:24.160 --> 2:23:31.440]  he was recruited and that he worked in deep background in public relations. He created
[2:23:31.440 --> 2:23:36.240]  this whole stone-tape theory that people like Rogan and others have promoted for years.
[2:23:36.240 --> 2:23:42.480]  All of that stuff is totally false. When I figured out all of this beginning about 12,
[2:23:42.480 --> 2:23:49.240]  13 years ago, I did an about face. I got away from the psychedelics. I started writing
[2:23:49.240 --> 2:23:53.040]  information to expose what it was doing to the culture.
[2:23:53.040 --> 2:23:59.720]  Today we only have to go outside and see people with the rings in their septum like cattle
[2:23:59.720 --> 2:24:08.200]  and hogs and purple and blue hair and big holes in their ears and their lower lip and
[2:24:08.200 --> 2:24:14.840]  stuff. All of this is about recreating the fall of humanity, taking us back to what was
[2:24:14.840 --> 2:24:22.400]  originally called the native revival or as Terrence McKenna coined it, the archaic revival.
[2:24:22.400 --> 2:24:28.520]  It's the false idea that because a culture is old and did drugs and were shamans, it's
[2:24:28.520 --> 2:24:34.360]  therefore better than our culture today. The term native revivalism comes out of an
[2:24:34.360 --> 2:24:41.200]  OSS memo written by Gregory Bates and talking about how the Russians overthrew certain indigenous
[2:24:41.200 --> 2:24:48.360]  cultures as well as how it could be used to attack certain groups in their own culture.
[2:24:48.360 --> 2:24:55.520]  This is what we see. We see the CIA launching the entirety of the psychedelic revolution
[2:24:55.520 --> 2:25:02.040]  against the American public. It was not blowback by any stretch of anyone's imagination. It
[2:25:02.040 --> 2:25:10.600]  didn't get out of the CIA's control as most people believe. The main books on MKUltra
[2:25:10.600 --> 2:25:15.760]  like John D. Mark's book, The Search for the Manchurian Candidate or Marty Lee's book,
[2:25:15.760 --> 2:25:26.000]  Massive Dreams, all of the leading books out there on MKUltra are disinformation to control
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:33.680]  the public narrative and to control what the people think MKUltra was about. Timothy Leary
[2:25:33.680 --> 2:25:41.160]  admitted from at least 1962 forward, he was admitted a witting CIA agent.
[2:25:41.160 --> 2:25:47.240]  So was Theodore Kaczynski the unabomber? Theodore Kaczynski was actually one of the
[2:25:47.240 --> 2:25:54.120]  victims of the Harvard social relations department under Henry A. Murray who was doing the human
[2:25:54.120 --> 2:26:02.840]  experiments at Harvard and they really screwed Ted Kaczynski up and he essentially retaliated.
[2:26:02.840 --> 2:26:08.400]  What's interesting is in my personal opinion, I think some of the areas he was targeting
[2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:15.560]  and with his manifesto, etc., he was trying to expose the technocracy and the control
[2:26:15.560 --> 2:26:19.760]  network that they're rolling out that we see today.
[2:26:19.760 --> 2:26:24.640]  And now they have a US military saying, let's give hallucinogens to the troops. And again,
[2:26:24.640 --> 2:26:30.000]  by themselves are one thing, but led by these people, it is definitely able to open them
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:33.720]  up to these other dimensions. And I've talked to people, well-known people that have been
[2:26:33.720 --> 2:26:38.200]  at these big events with Iowaska with up to 50 people and they're all having the same
[2:26:38.200 --> 2:26:42.000]  hallucination, but they're not all quotes seeing these aliens that look like little
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:46.720]  goats by the way or elves. Because you would individually see that hallucination. They're
[2:26:46.720 --> 2:26:50.440]  having grip hallucinations because the veil is being removed. They're actually having
[2:26:50.440 --> 2:26:54.440]  an interdimensional interface. And what are these aliens? Are these demons always tell
[2:26:54.440 --> 2:26:58.440]  people, Jan? They tell them, there's too many people. You're part of the elite. You're
[2:26:58.440 --> 2:27:01.800]  going to merge the machines. You're going to be God, but you've got to kill everybody
[2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:02.800]  first.
[2:27:02.800 --> 2:27:13.040]  And psychedelics also, I renamed them suggestogens in 2014 because they dramatically increased
[2:27:13.040 --> 2:27:20.280]  hyper suggestibility in the takers. So if you want to mind control someone and make
[2:27:20.280 --> 2:27:26.000]  them very impressionable, you give them psychedelic drugs and play the Grateful Dead or the Beatles
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:31.160]  or the Rolling Stones or whatever the case may be. In fact, if you ever even heard the
[2:27:31.160 --> 2:27:36.760]  word psychedelic before or the word in fuge and et cetera, you've already been suggested
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:42.400]  to the outcome of the experience and there's no safe way to take these substances.
[2:27:42.400 --> 2:27:46.400]  Well, they're definitely mainlining into the culture right now.
[2:27:46.400 --> 2:27:54.440]  Absolutely. Even at Davos and the World Economic Forum recently, they were promoting them.
[2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:58.120]  They're promoting them everywhere and people think that, you know, well, if the government
[2:27:58.120 --> 2:28:03.720]  doesn't want you to use it, why are they illegal? Well, Timothy Leary went before Congress
[2:28:03.720 --> 2:28:10.200]  in 1965 and requested that they outlaw them. You cannot have a good youthful rebellion
[2:28:10.200 --> 2:28:17.120]  with legal substances called psychotomimetics or schizophrenogens. So they outlawed them,
[2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:23.280]  they renamed them, and then they put Leary out there, Gordon Was and Terrence McKenna
[2:28:23.280 --> 2:28:27.760]  out there to promote them to the public. And they created this whole false narrative about
[2:28:27.760 --> 2:28:34.160]  why they were outlawed in the first place. Schizophrenogens. Let's talk about schizophrenogens
[2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:38.720]  when we come back, but we now know the weaponized marijuana is causing, they even admit this.
[2:28:38.720 --> 2:28:42.320]  I said it 10 years ago, they made fun of me, but now they admit this super strong marijuana
[2:28:42.320 --> 2:28:47.400]  is a hallucinogenist and the hallucinogenist class, the psychotropic, and these people
[2:28:47.400 --> 2:28:53.240]  are, it's causing massive artificial synthetic schizophrenia. We'll be right back with our
[2:28:53.240 --> 2:28:58.240]  special guest, Jan Irvin.

[2:29:56.920 --> 2:30:02.280]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual
[2:30:02.280 --> 2:30:07.240]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages, and the studies are all clear. The number
[2:30:07.240 --> 2:30:13.520]  one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom. And the number
[2:30:13.520 --> 2:30:19.120]  one issue men have is erectile dysfunction. Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes
[2:30:19.120 --> 2:30:23.400]  about this because they don't want people having lasting, good, loving relationships.
[2:30:23.400 --> 2:30:30.440]  They want to break up society. We are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement

[2:31:01.680 --> 2:31:06.840]  a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire. Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[2:31:06.840 --> 2:31:10.920]  You see it every year. Thirty different tax returns, thirty different answers. Fifty different
[2:31:10.920 --> 2:31:16.280]  tax returns, fifty different answers. And almost all of them just screw you over, especially
[2:31:16.280 --> 2:31:20.360]  the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't
[2:31:20.360 --> 2:31:24.640]  want the general public understanding this and knowing this. So it's a very important
[2:31:24.640 --> 2:31:30.680]  situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody. To be able to
[2:31:30.680 --> 2:31:34.440]  do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.

[2:33:08.280 --> 2:33:18.280]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:18.280 --> 2:33:24.560]  Don Urban is our guest author, researcher. He was very well known in the psychedelic
[2:33:24.560 --> 2:33:29.360]  movement, and then woke up to it. And I understand you're a Christian, so am I. You've written
[2:33:29.360 --> 2:33:33.920]  the book, God's Flesh, the true history of the sacred. I'm sure people can find more
[2:33:33.920 --> 2:33:42.560]  at logosmedia.logosmedia.com. But I know you understand this as good as I do, or probably
[2:33:42.560 --> 2:33:48.040]  better. I'm trying to explain to people that not everybody that's pushing this is corrupted.
[2:33:48.040 --> 2:33:51.440]  Those are part of this. I'm not judging anybody that's taking hallucinations. I've done it
[2:33:51.440 --> 2:33:55.680]  myself plenty when I was younger, but I did have dark experiences some of the times I
[2:33:55.680 --> 2:34:03.680]  did it, and I know it opens you up with some bad stuff. But I also, growing up, and I don't
[2:34:03.680 --> 2:34:08.120]  say this to try that cool, like I'm on the inside, because I'm not. This was so widespread.
[2:34:08.120 --> 2:34:13.400]  My mother had some friends that were involved in San Francisco at the Psychedelic Research
[2:34:13.400 --> 2:34:18.160]  Center. It was really a CIA front group. And I remember being a small child on road trips
[2:34:18.160 --> 2:34:22.960]  with them to the beach. My mom and her girlfriends, and because I was a little kid, I would go
[2:34:22.960 --> 2:34:27.360]  with them, or to like Hot Springs, Arkansas. And I remember sitting there in the back of
[2:34:27.360 --> 2:34:34.440]  the car listening to this particular woman who was describing what you see as DMT today,
[2:34:34.440 --> 2:34:38.280]  but with drips, intervenously, which I told Joe Rogan four years ago. And six months later,
[2:34:38.280 --> 2:34:42.080]  they brought it out on the show. Yeah, we're doing intervenious drips. We're doing this.
[2:34:42.080 --> 2:34:45.960]  Where they're like astronauts that they hook up, they put into this state, and they go
[2:34:45.960 --> 2:34:50.120]  and actually map and communicate. They believe interdimensionally with other entities. So
[2:34:50.120 --> 2:34:55.240]  the government takes it so seriously. And it's so widespread that even when I was five,
[2:34:55.240 --> 2:34:59.480]  six, seven, eight, nine, 10 years old, my mom's particular friend would come to the
[2:34:59.480 --> 2:35:05.200]  house. I remember three occasions, a beach trip once at the dinner table, and once on
[2:35:05.200 --> 2:35:13.040]  a trip in the Volkswagen Beetle, my mom had a Super Beetle, to Arkansas for a week with
[2:35:13.040 --> 2:35:18.760]  her friend. And so you're in the back reading comic books, or sleeping, or eating candy,
[2:35:18.760 --> 2:35:22.120]  and the women are in the front of the car talking about all this, and what they were
[2:35:22.120 --> 2:35:29.280]  doing. So I kind of had an inside baseball view on that. And then I see this all being
[2:35:29.280 --> 2:35:33.080]  pushed by the Pentagon, pushing the culture, push everywhere. And I know you don't want
[2:35:33.080 --> 2:35:35.720]  to entice people to get into it. You don't want to talk about it. People go, wow, that's
[2:35:35.720 --> 2:35:40.720]  cool. I want to see that. But tell folks what people are seeing on DMT or these things
[2:35:40.720 --> 2:35:44.400]  and what's happening. Because the messages are the same. I mean, I think people need
[2:35:44.400 --> 2:35:49.680]  to know this is very dark. And then you know how scary and dangerous it actually is.
[2:35:49.680 --> 2:35:55.400]  You do see, you know, some like, you know, weird creatures or whatever. You know, it's
[2:35:55.400 --> 2:36:01.560]  kind of hard to explain. It's universal. And then we get ancient Egyptian, ancient Babylonian,
[2:36:01.560 --> 2:36:05.440]  ancient Sumerian texts. They describe the same thing. I mean, it's not like it's not
[2:36:05.440 --> 2:36:09.120]  like you're imagining it. What is it? What is it breaking through to?
[2:36:09.120 --> 2:36:13.480]  Well, I'm not sure what it's breaking through to. As far as we know, it could even be a
[2:36:13.480 --> 2:36:18.320]  psychotic break. But you do often see like serpents, for instance. And that's really
[2:36:18.320 --> 2:36:23.680]  interesting considering that they, you know, people like Aldous Huxley and Timothy Leary
[2:36:23.680 --> 2:36:28.960]  admitted that it was a direct attack against Christianity. So why do so many people see
[2:36:28.960 --> 2:36:37.160]  serpents when they are on DMT or ayahuasca, etc. But, you know, a big part of this, and
[2:36:37.160 --> 2:36:42.440]  before the break, we discussed about promoting schizophrenia. And one of the original names
[2:36:42.440 --> 2:36:50.240]  for these drugs was schizophrenogens and psychotelmometics to mimic psychosis. And, you know, I think
[2:36:50.240 --> 2:36:56.880]  the real agenda is to move people away from a Christianity logos point of view, which reality
[2:36:56.880 --> 2:37:02.960]  is real. We're of the world. You have the right to choose what you want to do by your
[2:37:02.960 --> 2:37:09.840]  own agency. I do everybody's real in reality. And then you have the neoplatonist point of
[2:37:09.840 --> 2:37:16.280]  view or primacy of consciousness or monopsychism that, you know, everything is a reflection
[2:37:16.280 --> 2:37:24.880]  of me. I'm the center of the world. And, you know, there is no reality, etc. It's really
[2:37:24.880 --> 2:37:31.240]  the most egoic thing that anyone can believe. And this is really the core of the whole leftist
[2:37:31.240 --> 2:37:36.360]  world. Isn't that called Satanism when it's all about you? What's that? Isn't that the
[2:37:36.360 --> 2:37:41.760]  definition of Satanism? Is it all about me? Right. And that's exactly what neoplatonism
[2:37:41.760 --> 2:37:48.360]  and this monopsychism is. You deny all of reality. Alex, you don't have your own agency
[2:37:48.360 --> 2:37:52.400]  to do what you want. You're just a reflection of me. There's only one philosophy in the
[2:37:52.400 --> 2:37:58.920]  world, mine. You know, and so this is what monopsychism and, you know, neoplatonism is
[2:37:58.920 --> 2:38:04.760]  all about is this denial of reality. And that goes directly against Christianity, which
[2:38:04.760 --> 2:38:12.680]  is reality is real. Logos means that truth is God. That's John one. In part, truth is
[2:38:12.680 --> 2:38:18.160]  God. It's also Logos is where we get the word logic. If you look up Logos and like Strong's
[2:38:18.160 --> 2:38:25.320]  concordance, it tells you that it means reason, which is logic. Logic is the art of noncontradictory
[2:38:25.320 --> 2:38:31.840]  identification or truth. And it's also reality. So why are they trying to shift us away from
[2:38:31.840 --> 2:38:37.120]  believing in reality and that truth exists? Even, you know, several years ago, they came
[2:38:37.120 --> 2:38:41.800]  out and said, we're in the post truth age. What, you know, what does that mean exactly?
[2:38:41.800 --> 2:38:47.040]  Why are they trying to tell us the truth doesn't exist? Oh, it's all, you know, quantum physics
[2:38:47.040 --> 2:38:54.800]  and quantum mechanics. You can't know anything. Well, that's literally the definition of schizophrenia.
[2:38:54.800 --> 2:39:00.440]  And you know, so they have been in fact, I've done shows recently with Steve Jones discussing
[2:39:00.440 --> 2:39:08.680]  how they're promoting the normalization of schizophrenia. And if no truth exists, then
[2:39:08.680 --> 2:39:14.640]  you can behave any way you want. Murder goes pedophilia goes cannibalism goes anything you
[2:39:14.640 --> 2:39:20.480]  want to do rape goes. It's all good because there is no truth. There is no reality. Everything
[2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:26.320]  is just a reflection of me. I can do a woman a woman can be a man two men can have a baby
[2:39:26.320 --> 2:39:31.600]  adults can identify as children have sex with children just anything they want. Right there.
[2:39:31.600 --> 2:39:38.600]  And you know, and that's the definition of Satanism when you get down to it. So where
[2:39:38.600 --> 2:39:43.240]  is it all going? Because they're definitely building towards they're really pushing hard
[2:39:43.240 --> 2:39:50.240]  to know. Yep. Well, I think, you know, as as the research on the real agenda behind M.K.
[2:39:50.240 --> 2:39:57.240]  Ultra and Burning Man, etc. has come out, they've actually ramped it up significantly, trying
[2:39:57.240 --> 2:40:04.880]  to keep ahead of the curve of people waking up to my research to your research and my
[2:40:04.880 --> 2:40:09.920]  my latest book, for instance, God's Flesh, Teonanacotl, the true history of the sacred
[2:40:09.920 --> 2:40:14.800]  mushroom. I recommend people read it because I go through every single original report
[2:40:14.800 --> 2:40:20.520]  that the whole field of mushrooms is based on. And for those of you who say, well, mushrooms
[2:40:20.520 --> 2:40:25.440]  are older than the CIA. Therefore, they're the true origins of religion. You know, you're
[2:40:25.440 --> 2:40:32.360]  talking about a human sacrifice and cannibalism cult. You're not talking about logos and truth
[2:40:32.360 --> 2:40:41.480]  being God. You're talking about sacrificing people every 20 days to one of the Aztec gods
[2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:48.520]  for the Aztec calendar. They had a 20 day, 18 month calendar and question. Why do you
[2:40:48.520 --> 2:40:55.200]  focus on the Aztecs? I mean, every culture did this. I'm more interested in why groups
[2:40:55.200 --> 2:40:59.040]  that ever met each other were sacrificing children to demon gods. I mean, where the
[2:40:59.040 --> 2:41:04.320]  hell does this come from? Well, you know, if you look at, you know,
[2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:08.980]  it's possible that the Bible really explains it and you got the children. It's an off off
[2:41:08.980 --> 2:41:12.600]  world falling entity that wants to destroy us. I mean, you get us to kill our kids will
[2:41:12.600 --> 2:41:18.160]  do anything. Yeah. You know, but the reason I mentioned the Aztecs is they literally had
[2:41:18.160 --> 2:41:27.680]  the largest human sacrifice and cannibalism system ever created in humanity. So the worst,
[2:41:27.680 --> 2:41:33.280]  you know, yeah, there you go right there on screen, you know, sacrifice, you know, and
[2:41:33.280 --> 2:41:38.080]  you know, that's another point. How do you get people to do soft kill eugenics, kill
[2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:43.800]  off their own families? You tell them it's a right. And you know, but they don't even
[2:41:43.800 --> 2:41:48.240]  realize that this is all being promoted as eugenics, soft kill eugenics. You imagine
[2:41:48.240 --> 2:41:52.880]  the Spaniard show up looking for gold and they find giant incredible cities of people
[2:41:52.880 --> 2:41:58.040]  eating little children. I mean, just blood and dead bodies everywhere. I mean, it's insane.
[2:41:58.040 --> 2:42:04.640]  Yeah, absolutely insane. And then liberals say the Spaniards were the bad guys. Right.
[2:42:04.640 --> 2:42:11.960]  And you know, so many of the indigenous Native Americans were were grateful to to have Christianity
[2:42:11.960 --> 2:42:22.600]  because it ended that so over 50% of the cultures from Guatemala to Alaska over 50% were cannibal
[2:42:22.600 --> 2:42:29.600]  cultures. That's well documented. So, you know, and they had this Professor William
[2:42:29.600 --> 2:42:37.880]  Aaron's in 1979, he published a book called The Man Eating Myth, trying to debunk any
[2:42:37.880 --> 2:42:44.760]  of it. And then it turns out that this guy, as I published in the book was an agent for
[2:42:44.760 --> 2:42:50.600]  the Chinese Communist Party. So why by the way, the Communist Party had had had parties
[2:42:50.600 --> 2:42:54.360]  where they ate their political enemies. That's New York Times even amidst that. We're right
[2:42:54.360 --> 2:42:55.360]  back.
[2:42:55.360 --> 2:43:05.040]  The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass

[2:44:57.440 --> 2:45:04.120]  Donald Trump and the mighty republicans represented extremism that threatens the very foundations
[2:45:04.120 --> 2:45:08.480]  of our republic. I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't have an operational name. In
[2:45:08.480 --> 2:45:15.680]  fact, I bet it does. I bet it's called Operation Matador. They see us as the bull, and they
[2:45:15.680 --> 2:45:22.920]  are shaky, a red flag in our face. And the Matador is the deep state with a long skinny
[2:45:22.920 --> 2:45:28.560]  razor sharp sword so that when the bull lunges forward, the Matador uses the force of its
[2:45:28.560 --> 2:45:34.400]  weight to drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape as the bull buries himself
[2:45:34.400 --> 2:45:39.360]  into the dust. They've got the ace of spades in their hand, which is false flags. Before
[2:45:39.360 --> 2:45:43.920]  you launch a war, you stage false flags. That's the first thing you do because nobody wants
[2:45:43.920 --> 2:45:48.400]  to say they started a war. Bad guys start wars. So every time a war gets launched by
[2:45:48.400 --> 2:45:57.840]  bad guys, they stage an event. This is Operation Matador.
[2:45:57.840 --> 2:46:02.640]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular
[2:46:02.640 --> 2:46:08.240]  system, for your brain, for every part of your body. But what I don't see being promoted
[2:46:08.240 --> 2:46:16.080]  is the fact that it has natural psychotropic effects. It certainly does for me. When I
[2:46:16.080 --> 2:46:22.000]  take a couple of these capsules from an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing.
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:27.880]  Now there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain,
[2:46:27.880 --> 2:46:32.560]  but I want you to experience it yourself. We know it's good for your heart. We know it's
[2:46:32.560 --> 2:46:36.200]  good for your brain. We know it's good for your arteries and veins and your lungs and
[2:46:36.200 --> 2:46:41.000]  every other function of your body. But I want you to experience this high grade fish oil,
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:45.920]  this ultimate fish oil at infowarstore.com and see what it does if you take it before
[2:46:45.920 --> 2:46:52.880]  bedtime. Ultimate fish oil, 50% off, now exclusively available at infowarstore.com. Thank you all
[2:46:52.880 --> 2:46:59.880]  for your support. You're really going to miss out if you don't get it.
[2:47:22.880 --> 2:47:29.360]  John Irving is our guest. I'm going to host a little bit of the next hour. The Kate
[2:47:29.360 --> 2:47:34.840]  Daly takes over. I got to hit this news. It's on infowarstore.com. Shopped video Dutch government
[2:47:34.840 --> 2:47:41.680]  goons employ snatch and grab CIA tactics against farmers protesting having their farms taken
[2:47:41.680 --> 2:47:48.240]  away to quote stop global warming in the Netherlands. They'll have to kill me first, Steve Bannon,
[2:47:48.240 --> 2:47:56.520]  died in New York at a midterms. Inflation, state sponsored terrorism and so much more.
[2:47:56.520 --> 2:48:02.720]  I'll have those video for you at the start of the next hour. But John, we'll get you
[2:48:02.720 --> 2:48:07.760]  back on again soon. And I've watched your show. I've read your information. I know you're
[2:48:07.760 --> 2:48:10.640]  a well researched guy. I know what you're talking about. And I get your kind of give
[2:48:10.640 --> 2:48:14.640]  everybody the fifth grade level thing here. But our listeners know about devil worship.
[2:48:14.640 --> 2:48:18.080]  They know every culture has sacrificed with children. They know the Bible says stop giving
[2:48:18.080 --> 2:48:22.560]  your kids the fire of Moloch. The whole Testament is about Israelites fighting against people
[2:48:22.560 --> 2:48:29.120]  that were killing their kids. And of course, we have a story of Abraham where he finally
[2:48:29.120 --> 2:48:34.080]  stops the human sacrifice and God says stop that and grabs the angel grabs his hand. So
[2:48:34.080 --> 2:48:38.320]  this is really a demarcation line. Cultures that kill their children are evil and fallen
[2:48:38.320 --> 2:48:43.360]  and collapse. Those that sacrifice for the children ascend. I think that's really the
[2:48:43.360 --> 2:48:49.800]  model here and the historical fact here. But where do you expect this? California trying
[2:48:49.800 --> 2:48:54.360]  to pass laws other states passing laws to keep kids alive a month and then kill them.
[2:48:54.360 --> 2:48:58.640]  Euthanizing old people. I mean, they're really bringing human sacrifice back. What is the
[2:48:58.640 --> 2:49:04.840]  evil force? I know it's the devil. I know it's this this awful thing. But what is your
[2:49:04.840 --> 2:49:11.400]  view as a researcher on where it's going and how we stop it? Evil. I don't know deception.
[2:49:11.400 --> 2:49:19.400]  You know, it's it's getting getting people to sacrifice their own children to to Moloch
[2:49:19.400 --> 2:49:25.080]  and calling it their right and freedom, my body, my choice, all of this kind of stuff.
[2:49:25.080 --> 2:49:28.680]  It's it's you can't. I mean, if you have children, the ultimate thing
[2:49:28.680 --> 2:49:32.920]  is your children. And if something can get you to kill your children, it's got full control.
[2:49:32.920 --> 2:49:38.120]  Right. Absolutely. You know, and mothers should be the number one protectors of their children.
[2:49:38.120 --> 2:49:44.800]  Yet since 1973, they've mass murdered 63 million of their own children just in the United States
[2:49:44.800 --> 2:49:53.080]  alone and like 1.6 billion around the world. So, you know, it's they've turned motherhood
[2:49:53.080 --> 2:49:59.640]  into or, you know, what would have been mothers into the largest genocidal murders in all
[2:49:59.640 --> 2:50:07.680]  human history, you know, Mao, Pol Pot, Trotsky, Lenin, Stalin, you know, etc. They don't
[2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:14.640]  even hold a candle to the the number of people that have been murdered by by this leftist
[2:50:14.640 --> 2:50:20.360]  agenda. And here's the big question I have for you. Back in the Aztec times or in ancient
[2:50:20.360 --> 2:50:24.640]  cultures, they just burned their children or ate them. Now these mothers have their
[2:50:24.640 --> 2:50:31.040]  babies taken and cut up and their body parts sold on the world market beyond cannibalism.
[2:50:31.040 --> 2:50:37.280]  Absolutely. And, you know, we saw that news article what a month ago or so in the New
[2:50:37.280 --> 2:50:44.080]  York Times promoting cannibalism, you know, what's up with that. And we have no idea what
[2:50:44.080 --> 2:50:49.720]  they're using all of this stem cell research for if they're putting it in ingredients and
[2:50:49.720 --> 2:50:54.880]  food to make us all cannibals. Who knows how how far they're taking that. And then you
[2:50:54.880 --> 2:51:02.560]  have the whole petivore adrenochrome issue as well. And I show in the book how, you know,
[2:51:02.560 --> 2:51:09.200]  in 15 16th century reports, they were talking about these these people that were cannibalizing
[2:51:09.200 --> 2:51:16.800]  were so blood thirsty that they compared them to werewolves. You know, so this is where
[2:51:16.800 --> 2:51:23.200]  werewolves and vampirism come from. And this is why the Bible says the blood is the life.
[2:51:23.200 --> 2:51:28.400]  Do not drink the blood and people will attack that is like, you know, Christian or whatever.
[2:51:28.400 --> 2:51:33.160]  And this is the true origin of religion. And the pagans were so peaceful proto hippies.
[2:51:33.160 --> 2:51:40.200]  But that's nonsense. Paganism was a global human sacrifice and cannibalism cult that
[2:51:40.200 --> 2:51:48.680]  Christianity stopped. And, you know, we've basically had about 400 years without it.
[2:51:48.680 --> 2:51:52.960]  And these people are trying to bring this stuff back, essentially. And then we have
[2:51:52.960 --> 2:52:00.000]  to ask why. And that's a great clip there that you're showing from Mel Gibson's apocalypto.
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:05.880]  I mean, you know, if you, you know, it gives a pretty good summary of, you know, a pretty
[2:52:05.880 --> 2:52:15.560]  good idea of what was really going on in Montezuma's time in pre Colombian times. And so we're
[2:52:15.560 --> 2:52:21.400]  supposed to believe that the Christians were bad for stopping this global human sacrifice
[2:52:21.400 --> 2:52:27.120]  and cannibalism cult. And it's, it's nonsense. You know, who wants to, you know, who's going
[2:52:27.120 --> 2:52:31.880]  to be the first to argue that that stuff should come back and that Christianity was wrong.
[2:52:31.880 --> 2:52:37.400]  And I, you know, recommend people that don't believe me to go back in it. You know, the
[2:52:37.400 --> 2:52:43.080]  Catholic Church kept very extensive records of the inquisition court cases. And that's
[2:52:43.080 --> 2:52:49.280]  what the inquisition was. There were court cases, judge, lawyers, witnesses, you know,
[2:52:49.280 --> 2:52:54.800]  et cetera, you know, and it's like how people think of the inquisition today is if, you
[2:52:54.800 --> 2:53:03.040]  know, you know, some mass murder or some serial killer is put on death row and killed. But
[2:53:03.040 --> 2:53:08.920]  that's exemplary of all of, you know, the inquisitions. No, they were court cases out
[2:53:08.920 --> 2:53:18.000]  of 130,000 court cases of the Spanish inquisition. About 6,000 people were sentenced to death,
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:24.160]  particularly for murder, incest, rape, pretty atrocious crimes. So, you know, people need
[2:53:24.160 --> 2:53:29.280]  to get in there and study this stuff and learn that, you know, the church stopped so much
[2:53:29.280 --> 2:53:36.760]  of this awful behavior. And there has been significant effort to spin this false history
[2:53:36.760 --> 2:53:42.520]  against the church of just, you know, randomly going around and killing millions of witches
[2:53:42.520 --> 2:53:48.400]  or, you know, millions of cathars or millions of native Mexicans, et cetera. It's just
[2:53:48.400 --> 2:53:54.120]  not true. And in fact, the records prove the Catholic church stopped the witch hunts along
[2:53:54.120 --> 2:53:55.120]  the German border.
[2:53:55.120 --> 2:54:01.200]  Well, sure. I mean, I'm not going to defend any of the wars that went on and any of the
[2:54:01.200 --> 2:54:06.440]  excesses of the Catholic church or the Protestant wars, any of that or Cromwell or any of it.
[2:54:06.440 --> 2:54:12.680]  None of it's perfect. The point is, the history is clear, even from the Mesoamericans, 250
[2:54:12.680 --> 2:54:18.160]  something troops with Cortez arrive, and they just basically rebel and say, we don't want
[2:54:18.160 --> 2:54:21.880]  to live under this anymore. There was millions of people in Mexico City even then in the
[2:54:21.880 --> 2:54:27.000]  surrounding areas, and they were just begging to get rid of it. So, I mean, you're absolutely
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:32.040]  right. The left lionizes and defends all these pagan religions. And I remember making in
[2:54:32.040 --> 2:54:37.440]  game 1.5 that was just an addendum to the film we finally found and put on Bandai video.
[2:54:37.440 --> 2:54:42.920]  And I showed documents that I was shown by a historian where the CIA and the State Department
[2:54:42.920 --> 2:54:47.480]  and the UN were saying in the 60s, we're going to bring back paganism and bring back human
[2:54:47.480 --> 2:54:53.400]  sacrifice to get people not to value themselves because then there won't be a defensive life
[2:54:53.400 --> 2:54:56.960]  and then they'll accept anything. So that's really what this is.
[2:54:56.960 --> 2:55:02.800]  Yeah, you always promote dehumanization against your enemies so that you can wipe them out,
[2:55:02.800 --> 2:55:08.160]  whether or not it's your own children and just being a clump of cells rather than a
[2:55:08.160 --> 2:55:13.840]  human life, or being a parasite on the mother and helpless, and they're not a human life
[2:55:13.840 --> 2:55:20.800]  until they're able to live on their own at 18 or something. It's all ridiculous. And
[2:55:20.800 --> 2:55:26.880]  where does it end? If you're willing to kill your own child, what if somebody's in a
[2:55:26.880 --> 2:55:32.840]  coma in the hospital or any other various stages, then you're opening up the floodgates
[2:55:32.840 --> 2:55:37.960]  to allow the murder of just about anyone.
[2:55:37.960 --> 2:55:42.640]  Well there's no doubt it's being pushed right now and it's sick. Yann Irwin, I mean this
[2:55:42.640 --> 2:55:46.600]  whole transgenderism, cutting your son's testicles off, cutting your daughter's breast off, it's
[2:55:46.600 --> 2:55:50.800]  a form of sacrifice because they'll have no reproductive future. It is true evil. Thank
[2:55:50.800 --> 2:55:51.800]  you so much for the time.
[2:55:51.800 --> 2:55:54.440]  It's soft, it's soft kill eugenics as well.

[2:56:17.560 --> 2:56:21.520]  All right, I got a few more stories that are big and breaking that I want to hit. They're
[2:56:21.520 --> 2:56:26.600]  now treating farmers that protest having their farms shut down as terrorists. It's happening
[2:56:26.600 --> 2:56:29.880]  here, it's happening in Europe. It's all part of the New World Order. That's coming up at
[2:56:29.880 --> 2:56:35.160]  a Cate Daly taken over. Please remember, we're illicitly supported and we are on air still
[2:56:35.160 --> 2:56:40.000]  thanks to you, but we've got to be profitable during this Chapter 5 bankruptcy or they'll
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:43.800]  shut this place down and we're barely profitable right now. Thanks for your support, but keep
[2:56:43.800 --> 2:56:46.760]  us on air. Keep the fight going. The most important thing you can do in the fight against
[2:56:46.760 --> 2:56:50.880]  the New World Order is support this broadcast after getting right with God.

[2:58:54.440 --> 2:59:01.360]  UN Chiefs says going into 2023. World Food Program warns of global food catastrophe,
[2:59:01.360 --> 2:59:06.480]  looming global catastrophe. The world could run out of food by 2023. Major studies say

[2:59:11.120 --> 2:59:14.720]  two and a half years ago. We told you energy and food prices would explode and now they're
[2:59:14.720 --> 2:59:19.400]  up more than 40% of the U.S. alone. Some areas of the world are up over 100%. The only way

[3:00:12.360 --> 3:00:31.920]  So
[3:00:31.920 --> 3:00:37.440]  Goons employs sub-tactics against farmers protesting the Great Reset that have been
[3:00:37.440 --> 3:00:41.440]  carrying this action to grab policies against farmers. It's just insane. Shocked video from
[3:00:41.440 --> 3:00:46.800]  Amsterdam shows government upping anti against outraged farmers, pushing back against the
[3:00:46.800 --> 3:00:52.560]  targeting of livestock, and farmland by mass government Goons dragging protesters into police
[3:00:52.560 --> 3:01:10.000]  vans. Let's go ahead and roll this with audio and video.
[3:01:23.840 --> 3:01:30.480]  Peridio listeners, they're just grabbing people randomly out of crowds, throwing them in vans,
[3:01:32.240 --> 3:01:36.240]  because the government says they're going to get rid of 9% of the cows the next five years,
[3:01:36.240 --> 3:01:44.320]  banning 30% this year, because farming is bad for the earth. Cutting off the resources, waging
[3:01:44.320 --> 3:01:49.120]  war against the infrastructure, cutting off the power, this is the globalist takeover.
[3:01:49.120 --> 3:01:54.640]  This is the Soviet Union on steroids. This is the Kulaks in Ukraine and
[3:01:56.400 --> 3:02:05.360]  Western Russia. It's unbelievable criminal activity. This is the Great Reset.
[3:02:07.120 --> 3:02:13.280]  This is the New World Order, and we have to come together and say no and identify the WEF
[3:02:13.280 --> 3:02:21.360]  as the enemy running this entire operation. I'm going to try to give Steve Bannon on to Mara
[3:02:21.360 --> 3:02:27.680]  the next day. Steve Bannon raised millions. They built a bunch of border wall for advertising,
[3:02:27.680 --> 3:02:31.360]  and crew, and staff, and travel. They got a couple hundred thousand dollars over a year.
[3:02:31.920 --> 3:02:36.240]  They never denied that. How do you think you operate? I mean, you look at the
[3:02:36.240 --> 3:02:46.960]  one foundation with Bono of U2, he gives less than 1%. Bannon's foundation gave over 95%.
[3:02:47.600 --> 3:02:50.880]  The group is working with to build the wall. They're calling that a fraud,
[3:02:50.880 --> 3:02:59.360]  so he got pardoned for this by Trump, so now he's been indicted. They will have to kill me first.
[3:02:59.360 --> 3:03:05.200]  Bannon indicted in New York at a midterms, charges Mara 2020 federal case against him,
[3:03:05.200 --> 3:03:11.680]  alleging he defrauded donors, fundraising to build the border wall. They're coming for assault,
[3:03:11.680 --> 3:03:15.440]  Bannon warns. This is nothing more than a partisan political weaponization
[3:03:15.440 --> 3:03:20.320]  of the criminal justice system. Mara, why don't you try to just see Bannon was indicted today
[3:03:20.320 --> 3:03:26.000]  by New York prosecutors in a move. He claims as part of the partisan political weaponization
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:33.920]  of the criminal justice system, and it goes on from there. He's been swatted three times in
[3:03:33.920 --> 3:03:40.720]  the last few weeks. It just gets more insane by the moment and make no mistake. They're trying to
[3:03:40.720 --> 3:03:47.440]  set us up as well. This is such a dangerous moment. Hunter Biden can have crack horrors and
[3:03:47.440 --> 3:03:52.880]  children he's raping and says he works for Chinese intelligence in audio tapes released.
[3:03:52.880 --> 3:03:58.240]  That's okay. Steve Bannon was involved in a charity that advertised on a show,
[3:03:58.240 --> 3:04:06.160]  try to build a border wall, and now he is worse than the devil. We've got to stand with Steve
[3:04:06.160 --> 3:04:12.000]  Bannon. We've got to pray for Steve Bannon. We've got to support him because he's under massive,
[3:04:12.000 --> 3:04:16.560]  massive attack, and he's come out against Trump of the vaccines. He's trying to wake Trump up.
[3:04:17.520 --> 3:04:20.880]  He has come out against the whole globalist program. He's come out against Jared Kushner,
[3:04:21.600 --> 3:04:26.640]  and so you now see what's happening with Steve Bannon. Is he perfect? No. My perfect, no.
[3:04:26.640 --> 3:04:31.120]  But the enemy of freedom is definitely after him. But don't take this broadcast for granted either.

[3:06:02.560 --> 3:06:06.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Kate Daly, your guest host for this hour.
[3:06:06.560 --> 3:06:12.240]  And I am from KateDalyRadio.com, the Kate Daly Show. All right. I have so many things on my mind
[3:06:12.240 --> 3:06:18.480]  today. First off, I just want to mention that I'm marking myself safe from 77 years of fear
[3:06:18.480 --> 3:06:25.280]  that Russia's going to attack us. For 77 years, they have been saying Russia will attack. For
[3:06:25.280 --> 3:06:30.400]  all of you that remember getting under your desks in the 50s, I don't remember that. I was born in
[3:06:30.400 --> 3:06:36.320]  the 60s. But what I'm saying is we have been in fear for a very long time, still trying to sell
[3:06:36.320 --> 3:06:42.080]  the fear. 77 years marked safe. Anyway, I have so much to talk about today. I want to talk a
[3:06:42.080 --> 3:06:46.560]  little bit about the occult. I know I hate that topic because I feel like it invites stuff in,
[3:06:46.560 --> 3:06:52.800]  but I'm going to talk about it because of what Disney did and what Disney is doing. And really,
[3:06:52.800 --> 3:06:59.280]  I want to actually kind of look at the big picture here on what the last century looked like in
[3:06:59.280 --> 3:07:04.720]  this type of thing and how people are being sold on it in really strange ways now. I also wanted
[3:07:04.720 --> 3:07:10.480]  to say, I wasn't here last week. I actually had an emergency for a member of my family. And it's a
[3:07:10.480 --> 3:07:16.960]  big lesson in check your blood levels. You'll go into socialized medicine now into the hospitals
[3:07:16.960 --> 3:07:21.920]  and maybe you have a couple of symptoms, nausea or something like that. And what happens is,
[3:07:21.920 --> 3:07:27.440]  is they'll give you nausea medication. They will just dismiss it as if it's just a nothing symptom
[3:07:27.440 --> 3:07:33.120]  when there's no other symptoms or it could be any symptom. My biggest advice to people right now
[3:07:33.120 --> 3:07:39.680]  is to get away from socialized medicine and the hospitalists and the hospitals and do more on
[3:07:39.680 --> 3:07:44.320]  your part that you can do. And if you have to pay for blood draws every year just to kind of see
[3:07:44.320 --> 3:07:49.200]  where you're at, to see where all your levels are, levels like calcium in your blood can mean
[3:07:49.200 --> 3:07:56.800]  something totally different when they're elevated. And so my biggest lesson last week is make sure
[3:07:56.800 --> 3:08:02.320]  that you're doing this all along because you can probably thwart something coming and we all need
[3:08:02.320 --> 3:08:07.360]  to be doing that. And you can do a lot with nutrition and a lot with health if you're on top of it
[3:08:07.360 --> 3:08:11.200]  and you know where you stand. And oftentimes with our kids and everything else, we don't think of
[3:08:11.200 --> 3:08:16.480]  these things. We don't think, you know, hey, maybe I should just see where they're at because a blood
[3:08:16.480 --> 3:08:23.040]  draw can actually tell the tell a pretty big story on what's happening to your kids and your family
[3:08:23.040 --> 3:08:28.160]  members. Just keep that in mind. It's something we should probably be doing yearly because of all
[3:08:28.160 --> 3:08:32.080]  the things sprayed on us, the things that we're eating, all the things that our body is trying
[3:08:32.080 --> 3:08:38.880]  to get away from, trying to save us from, I should say. It's a big deal. Make sure that you take
[3:08:38.880 --> 3:08:44.320]  charge of your health is the big lesson. And don't wait for them to ask you to go do that
[3:08:44.320 --> 3:08:48.160]  because you'll be holding your breath for quite a long time. They probably won't. They don't care
[3:08:48.160 --> 3:08:52.560]  about health. They care about pharma and they care about symptoms. They're like collectors of
[3:08:52.560 --> 3:08:58.640]  symptoms and it's bad news for all of our health. It truly is. So make sure that you're doing that
[3:08:58.640 --> 3:09:06.000]  and staying on top of it. It's a good idea and it takes a second and just do it. I promise you
[3:09:06.000 --> 3:09:12.640]  on this, just do it. I watched the movie Network and the movie, remember the old movie Network
[3:09:12.640 --> 3:09:18.400]  from years and years ago and the Truman Show back to back? Kind of an interesting duo of movies
[3:09:18.400 --> 3:09:24.640]  because one obviously is telling you that media lies to mainstream media will lie to you and lie
[3:09:24.640 --> 3:09:30.720]  to you and lie to you. And then you have the Truman Show, which is basically a red pill moment
[3:09:31.600 --> 3:09:38.880]  when you realize the world is different from what you think it is. And watching Truman go through,
[3:09:38.880 --> 3:09:44.160]  Jim Carrey, go through the process of being red-pilled. Somebody says something to him and all
[3:09:44.160 --> 3:09:48.560]  of a sudden he thinks, oh, well, wait a second. Why are you saying this to me? Does it make sense?
[3:09:48.560 --> 3:09:55.200]  And then he starts to look and this is where the big moment is for a lot of people. Maybe it was
[3:09:55.200 --> 3:10:00.960]  for you too. You start to look around to see whether or not what that person said to you and in this
[3:10:00.960 --> 3:10:06.320]  case it was, hey, this isn't real. Everybody's being paid to be your friend. Everybody's being paid
[3:10:06.320 --> 3:10:12.240]  and you're in basically a show. So he starts looking around and he starts realizing that people are
[3:10:12.240 --> 3:10:17.360]  on a loop, right? Going around his house and he starts, it freaks him out. He starts realizing,
[3:10:17.360 --> 3:10:21.200]  oh my gosh, there's the girl on the bike and there's the guy with the flowers and there's the
[3:10:21.200 --> 3:10:27.200]  yellow beetle and it's on a loop. And he thinks, well, that's odd. Something's wrong with this
[3:10:27.200 --> 3:10:32.400]  picture. Well, of course, because you start really seeing it for what it is when you get new
[3:10:32.400 --> 3:10:37.760]  eyes and a new perspective, changes everything, doesn't it? And then you start seeing pieces
[3:10:37.760 --> 3:10:42.720]  fall into place, right? There was a big light that came down from the movie set out of the sky
[3:10:42.720 --> 3:10:47.440]  and he's looking up going, why is there a light falling out of the sky? Doesn't make sense. And
[3:10:47.440 --> 3:10:52.560]  so in that red pill moment, you've probably been pretty red-pilled or you wouldn't be listening
[3:10:52.560 --> 3:10:57.040]  now, right, to this. And so you started to realize that things were much, much different.
[3:10:57.600 --> 3:11:02.240]  And you started to see things in a way in the last century that have kind of come down on us
[3:11:02.240 --> 3:11:07.520]  and it has been an interesting experiment in humanity because you realize how controlled
[3:11:07.520 --> 3:11:13.280]  things really are and you realize how we have been infiltrated. We are the proverbial frog in
[3:11:13.280 --> 3:11:17.840]  the hot water. We just don't see it. We just don't. It's hard to see. It's hard to realize.
[3:11:17.840 --> 3:11:23.200]  You know, Beyonce can do a, you know, like I'm going to call it a skit, but it's not a skit,
[3:11:23.200 --> 3:11:29.280]  it's like a number, a musical number on the stage at the Grammys and she's basically dancing out of,
[3:11:29.280 --> 3:11:36.000]  you know, Satan's crotch and we're like, hey, I like the beat. I like the beat of that song.
[3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:42.960]  That's a cool song. I mean, we don't even see it anymore. I mean, Madonna virtually does the same
[3:11:42.960 --> 3:11:48.240]  thing. We just go, ah, she's got little demons dancing around her. It doesn't matter. It's
[3:11:48.240 --> 3:11:54.000]  entertainment. It's them being an artist. No, it's not. No, it's not. It's far more sinister than
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:11:59.360]  that, but we have been so used to it. And I think with our goodness, we're not going to see these
[3:11:59.360 --> 3:12:05.760]  things. See, that's a perfect clip. These little demons dancing around and we're not shocked by
[3:12:05.760 --> 3:12:12.800]  that. 150 years ago, we would have been shocked by that. You know why? Because we talked about God
[3:12:12.800 --> 3:12:19.280]  a lot. It was in a lot of conversations. We didn't have this thing called a TV and media and social
[3:12:19.280 --> 3:12:26.720]  media to distract us quite so heavily. So I'm watching these movies and I'm realizing that
[3:12:26.720 --> 3:12:30.720]  moment is such a big moment for people and they start to kind of realize and that's what happened
[3:12:30.720 --> 3:12:38.400]  to me. The last 10 years have been the biggest red pilling I've ever gone through ever. So I want
[3:12:38.400 --> 3:12:43.920]  to talk just a little bit about Disney. They have a new movie called Little Demon, Danny
[3:12:43.920 --> 3:12:50.080]  DeVito Special. Danny DeVito is a hardcore leftist and so is his daughter. She plays the Antichrist.
[3:12:50.080 --> 3:12:55.280]  Her mother was impregnated in this cartoon by Satan. I'm sure you've heard about it. I'm sure
[3:12:55.280 --> 3:13:01.760]  they've talked about it on here and everybody's shocked. I'm not shocked. Are you kidding me?
[3:13:02.320 --> 3:13:07.040]  You go look at Disney's past and you go look at everything that has to do with what we've been
[3:13:07.040 --> 3:13:11.760]  shown for the last 100 years. You're not going to be shocked at all. This is just the next evolution.
[3:13:12.480 --> 3:13:18.640]  The evolution period that we're in right now is so what? And this is who we are. They used to do
[3:13:18.640 --> 3:13:23.840]  a little bit more sleight of hand. The sleight of hand isn't there anymore. They don't need to do it.
[3:13:23.840 --> 3:13:31.040]  That's the point. I and Rand used to have these arguments that basically politics weren't really
[3:13:31.040 --> 3:13:36.240]  about politics. It was about something much deeper. It's about philosophy. It's about foundational
[3:13:36.240 --> 3:13:43.040]  issues in philosophy. And she's right. And there's this new projection of the left
[3:13:43.040 --> 3:13:48.000]  and its magical thinking. And now when I say that, you're going to notice this more and more
[3:13:48.000 --> 3:13:55.360]  coming from leftists. Everything is about magic. Everything is about magical thinking.
[3:13:55.360 --> 3:13:59.920]  I mean, it has to do with so many issues of the day, too. And that's what's kind of interesting,
[3:13:59.920 --> 3:14:07.520]  too. I'll get into that. But this is where you really kind of look at the fact that the food
[3:14:07.520 --> 3:14:11.760]  shortages. Why are they doing the food shortages? Because they want us to be very distracted from
[3:14:11.760 --> 3:14:16.320]  what they're actually doing and that's looting the country. So the food shortages are to make
[3:14:16.320 --> 3:14:20.480]  us concentrated on, oh, my gosh, we're not going to have any food, which is a true thing. We're
[3:14:20.480 --> 3:14:25.920]  not going to have any food. And you need to be very scared about this every day. So don't look
[3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:29.760]  at what we're doing. Don't look at the hijacking, the money laundering, and all the rest.
[3:14:31.440 --> 3:14:36.320]  Poverty now is a political choice. It's a political choice by this coup d'administration
[3:14:36.320 --> 3:14:42.800]  that got in to the White House where they make decisions to make you poor. Political decisions
[3:14:42.800 --> 3:14:48.400]  to make you poor. It's not that you're there by choice. It's that they are ramping everything up,
[3:14:48.400 --> 3:14:53.200]  the cost of everything. Everything is going up and it's not coming down. And so it's going to
[3:14:53.200 --> 3:14:57.040]  get harder and harder to live. And couples are going to have to work outside the home more and
[3:14:57.040 --> 3:15:01.520]  more, try to be a stay-at-home mom. It's not going to happen. It's just not going to happen,
[3:15:01.520 --> 3:15:08.480]  not with the way things are going right now. Global warming, another great example of magical
[3:15:08.480 --> 3:15:14.800]  thinking. We're going to tell you you are a super good person if you want less emissions.
[3:15:15.360 --> 3:15:21.040]  Do less emissions do anything? No, no. Does the money go anywhere? No, of course not.
[3:15:21.600 --> 3:15:26.000]  It's all about selling a magical thinking idea because then you compact yourself on the back
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:31.440]  and you don't have to actually do anything. You can just be for these hoaxes. You can just be for
[3:15:32.960 --> 3:15:36.960]  in support of these types of things. When I come back, I want to get into a little bit of the
[3:15:36.960 --> 3:15:41.920]  occult and how people are joining that movement right now. It isn't what you think it is. And a
[3:15:41.920 --> 3:15:47.920]  lot of things are being sold to us under that movement that are truly something else. It's
[3:15:47.920 --> 3:15:52.320]  a huge sleight of hand. I'll be right back. I'm Kay Deli, your guest host on The Alex Jones Show.
[3:15:58.960 --> 3:16:04.720]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or in person,
[3:16:04.720 --> 3:16:09.520]  it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry.
[3:16:10.160 --> 3:16:14.000]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every

[3:16:58.640 --> 3:17:04.320]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico,
[3:17:04.320 --> 3:17:09.120]  the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[3:17:09.120 --> 3:17:13.840]  above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee. And yeah, we buy it from the
[3:17:13.840 --> 3:17:17.440]  little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune.
[3:17:17.440 --> 3:17:21.280]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it. And the farmers don't
[3:17:21.280 --> 3:17:24.480]  want the Mexican government to take over. So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and
[3:17:24.480 --> 3:17:27.600]  I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up. The same stuff
[3:17:27.600 --> 3:17:32.240]  sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound. And I just think it's some of
[3:17:32.240 --> 3:17:36.560]  the best coffee you're going to find anywhere. It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas
[3:17:36.560 --> 3:17:44.720]  rebels, literally. In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story. I'd like that. Okay,
[3:17:44.720 --> 3:17:50.000]  you wouldn't believe it. Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[3:17:50.000 --> 3:17:51.920]  And if you don't fund us and don't want to see it, that's fine.
[3:17:56.240 --> 3:18:00.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, if millions of people get this book, our funding problems will be over
[3:18:00.320 --> 3:18:04.240]  and it's starting to happen. That's why I said, yeah, go to infowarstore.com, get the book and
[3:18:04.240 --> 3:18:07.280]  start shipping in a couple of weeks. The Great Reset and the War for the World. But I said,
[3:18:07.280 --> 3:18:12.480]  go to Amazon, because it's the number one book chart in the world. And if it goes to number one,
[3:18:12.480 --> 3:18:17.520]  not a political, not of history, not of US history, it's already number one over 40 categories
[3:18:17.520 --> 3:18:22.960]  like political science, you name it. 40 plus categories is number one. Ladies and gentlemen,
[3:18:22.960 --> 3:18:29.120]  drum roll, please, of books in the world. The Great Reset and the War for the World is
[3:18:29.120 --> 3:18:35.920]  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. We are now number nine in the world.
[3:18:35.920 --> 3:18:42.400]  Woo! This is major. This is political. This could fund our war chest. Just go to Amazon.com,
[3:18:42.400 --> 3:18:48.480]  everybody, and buy 10 copies. Send this blueprint to the Death Star and the New World Order,
[3:18:48.480 --> 3:18:51.600]  because you read this, you know, their whole plan, how to stop them. Get the Great Reset and
[3:18:51.600 --> 3:18:54.320]  War for the World now. It's going to go to number one. What do you make of that?
[3:18:57.360 --> 3:19:04.480]  Our world is so full of hype. We are force-fed, dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate media,
[3:19:04.480 --> 3:19:10.080]  by the controlled churches and the universities. And why is this the case? Because we innately,
[3:19:10.080 --> 3:19:14.720]  by God, have been given the keys for our own minds, our own psyches, our own souls,
[3:19:15.440 --> 3:19:19.280]  and by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves and trend,
[3:19:19.280 --> 3:19:25.680]  send the quote, fallen or sinful state. So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things
[3:19:25.680 --> 3:19:31.440]  we try to bring into our bodies to change who we are are only lowering us. They're only making
[3:19:31.440 --> 3:19:36.240]  us more depressed. From the end, they're only making us less fulfilled. It is only by going
[3:19:36.240 --> 3:19:40.720]  within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves.
[3:19:40.720 --> 3:19:45.040]  That's why the globalist, bombardist, and toxins and chemicals to block us getting the
[3:19:45.040 --> 3:19:50.720]  normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to
[3:19:50.720 --> 3:19:55.040]  basically reach out beyond the third dimension. And that's where the incredible products come in
[3:19:55.040 --> 3:20:03.760]  and forced.org.com. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:10.800 --> 3:20:14.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm your guest host, Kate Daly from the Kate Daly show.
[3:20:15.520 --> 3:20:19.840]  All right. So let's talk, let's get into this a little bit deeper because I wasn't shocked at all
[3:20:19.840 --> 3:20:26.320]  about about Disney's little demon. And I know that I felt like a little gas lit from it actually
[3:20:26.320 --> 3:20:32.160]  like, Oh, what are they doing now? Well, doing this a long, long time. And I want to talk about
[3:20:32.160 --> 3:20:39.760]  a little bit about why how we're being, how they're using the sleight of hand to get us to engage
[3:20:39.760 --> 3:20:44.800]  in the practices of the occult, the leftist special, without realizing we're in it. That's
[3:20:44.800 --> 3:20:52.080]  what's crazy. So there was a great article about Sabrina, the teenage witch, and it was back on
[3:20:52.080 --> 3:20:57.760]  the small screen, right? It was this like darker like Netflix, of course, the Obama's a huge part
[3:20:57.760 --> 3:21:03.680]  in Netflix. They're a wonderful couple. Anyway, Netflix series and the reboot of this like little
[3:21:03.680 --> 3:21:09.840]  witchy cult film, the craft is in the works. If you guys noticed too, the reason I'm doing this
[3:21:09.840 --> 3:21:15.520]  segment today is because I noticed something when I was looking at upcoming movies. And
[3:21:16.400 --> 3:21:22.960]  we have more gore and Halloween movies coming out than ever before. In fact, romcoms are just,
[3:21:23.760 --> 3:21:28.080]  I don't know, they're not doing them anymore. I don't know, maybe a sprinkling of them throughout
[3:21:28.080 --> 3:21:33.280]  the whole next year. But really, it's about gore. It's about it's they're starting early, we'll just
[3:21:33.280 --> 3:21:39.120]  say that. And these Halloween ish sort of movies used to kind of hit you'd get one big one during
[3:21:39.120 --> 3:21:45.520]  Halloween. And now it's like this huge influx where the big concentration is on gore violence and
[3:21:45.520 --> 3:21:53.280]  the occult, which is really strange to see this, not strange, but fascinating to watch. And so the
[3:21:53.280 --> 3:21:57.760]  phrase witch hunt, you know, we have all of these kinds of things, all these phrases, all these
[3:21:57.760 --> 3:22:03.200]  things that were constantly being told. So they think about a million to five million people
[3:22:03.200 --> 3:22:08.320]  identify as pagan, right? Or Wiccan or in one of these groups, it's not very popular. I mean,
[3:22:08.320 --> 3:22:13.920]  Hillary has no problem saying she's a witch. But and there's some stars out there that have
[3:22:13.920 --> 3:22:18.480]  actually come out. Now that would have been the death of a star 60 years ago in their career
[3:22:18.480 --> 3:22:23.840]  to say that they were part of a covenant or or witches or the whole nine yards. But there are
[3:22:23.840 --> 3:22:32.000]  so many that are practicing now. And and so now, if you really look at it, about six and 10 Americans,
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:40.320]  so 60% of Americans right now ascribe to at least one new age belief that isn't exactly about God.
[3:22:41.040 --> 3:22:46.480]  And they're going away from organized religions to more of these new age types of things,
[3:22:46.480 --> 3:22:53.520]  believing in astrology, believing in psychics, believing in crystals, believing in all of these
[3:22:53.520 --> 3:22:59.200]  different things to kind of help them through their day. In fact, they're really mass marketed.
[3:22:59.200 --> 3:23:06.240]  So you've got this this billion, multi billion dollar industry right now with only more steady
[3:23:06.240 --> 3:23:13.200]  growth coming because you have millennials and Gen Gen Zers that are more likely than any other
[3:23:13.200 --> 3:23:18.880]  age group to get involved with a number of these things. We also have a steady diet of Harry Potter.
[3:23:18.880 --> 3:23:26.960]  We have more new age available to us now in so many ways that we don't even see it. And I did
[3:23:26.960 --> 3:23:32.240]  a show a number of years ago, maybe a year, maybe it was a year or two ago on on The Secret. And
[3:23:32.240 --> 3:23:36.720]  I'll talk about that in just a moment too. But if you look at this, even urban outfitters carries
[3:23:36.720 --> 3:23:42.720]  all these different kinds of crystals and tarot cards and all these different ritual kits,
[3:23:42.720 --> 3:23:47.680]  a ritual kit. Do we know what that is? It's a witchcraft kit. It's insides and it's crystals
[3:23:47.680 --> 3:23:53.280]  and it's sage. You've got Gwyneth Paltrow and you've got all these different things. She's got
[3:23:53.280 --> 3:24:00.480]  this glass water bottle she sells with a pillar of amethyst and with the power of crystals. See,
[3:24:00.480 --> 3:24:07.520]  it's just sort of marketed, if you will. So why did they make the movie Little Demon? Why did Danny
[3:24:07.520 --> 3:24:13.120]  DeVito get so excited about this with his daughter and the whole producing crew from the show community?
[3:24:13.120 --> 3:24:18.800]  Why did they want to do this so bad? They took the whole year of 2020 when everyone was in lockdown
[3:24:18.800 --> 3:24:25.840]  to develop this idea of a 13-year-old being the Antichrist. And it's all of her antics. Oh,
[3:24:25.840 --> 3:24:32.960]  how cute. A little cartoon for you. Well, they did it because there's a market for it. That's why.
[3:24:32.960 --> 3:24:38.320]  And they knew it. And they knew it. And we must think of it in those terms because they weren't
[3:24:38.320 --> 3:24:42.560]  just throwing something out there. It wasn't like they hired somebody and just wanted to,
[3:24:42.560 --> 3:24:46.640]  this is on Netflix, by the way, streaming a Disney production, but they weren't just throwing
[3:24:46.640 --> 3:24:51.520]  this out there. They've been doing it for a really long time. Look back at Walt Disney's
[3:24:51.520 --> 3:24:56.880]  whole entire career. What did he start out with? Think about this for just a second. What did he
[3:24:56.880 --> 3:25:05.040]  start out with? The skeleton dance. Why? It was in the summertime. It wasn't Halloween. It wasn't
[3:25:05.040 --> 3:25:11.360]  like something marketed to the littles for Halloween. It was the skeleton dance. Now,
[3:25:11.920 --> 3:25:16.160]  if you're a guy that is, and he's got a really strange background, but if you're a guy that's
[3:25:16.160 --> 3:25:20.880]  intent on making cartoons for kids, and even though you don't have any artistic talent,
[3:25:20.880 --> 3:25:25.840]  which he really didn't, he relied on other people to draw Mickey and all the rest. In fact, my
[3:25:26.480 --> 3:25:32.320]  uncle even worked at Disney, drawing some of those characters. So if you're a guy that's set on
[3:25:33.520 --> 3:25:38.880]  producing something for children, why would your first, one of your first things out of the gate
[3:25:38.880 --> 3:25:47.520]  be the skeleton dance? It's kind of a macabre, strange way to introduce yourself to the world
[3:25:47.520 --> 3:25:52.640]  of children, isn't it? Do you think people saw it back then? Do you think people actually saw
[3:25:52.640 --> 3:26:00.160]  what he was doing? It's the best magic trick or sleight of hand in this last century is Disney.
[3:26:00.160 --> 3:26:09.120]  Disney is some wonderful, cute little business for kids. It's some sweet little thing. At the time,
[3:26:09.680 --> 3:26:15.120]  movies were kind of known as Babylon. Hollywood was known as Babylon. It had a really bad
[3:26:15.120 --> 3:26:23.760]  reputation for a reason, because it is. So here comes Disney, and Disney is nothing but promoted.
[3:26:23.760 --> 3:26:29.840]  Nothing but promoted. And what's interesting about this was they needed something to clean up
[3:26:29.840 --> 3:26:36.960]  the image, and they introduced Disney. And so here it comes out in the summer, it's 1929.
[3:26:36.960 --> 3:26:44.320]  Okay, it comes out in August, and it's about a spooky graveyard with, you know, macabre imagery.
[3:26:44.320 --> 3:26:49.760]  Very, very interesting. Then he comes out with the Sorcerer's Apprentice in 1940. Guess what?
[3:26:49.760 --> 3:26:56.160]  It wasn't a huge success at the time. People weren't enamored with this. Now they call it brilliant.
[3:26:56.160 --> 3:27:02.560]  He was brilliant. No, he wasn't. He had an agenda, but people failed to see it. They didn't want to
[3:27:02.560 --> 3:27:09.040]  see it. Nobody does. And so what was this about? Mickey puts on the hat and tries magic on a broom.
[3:27:09.040 --> 3:27:14.240]  He commands the broom to carry buckets of water to fill a cauldron. And since Mickey is satisfied,
[3:27:14.240 --> 3:27:19.040]  he sits down on the chair and he falls asleep. He dreams that he's a powerful Sorcerer high on
[3:27:19.040 --> 3:27:25.040]  the top of a pinnacle commanding the stars and planets and water. Ouch. Don't witches do that?
[3:27:25.040 --> 3:27:33.040]  Just, hmm. Mickey wakes up to find that the room is filled with water and the broom isn't stopping and
[3:27:33.040 --> 3:27:39.680]  it goes on and on and on. Now, why would you do a movie like this? Why couldn't you do a cute little
[3:27:39.680 --> 3:27:47.200]  film where Mickey, the cute little mouse who he wanted to name Mortimer, where this cute little
[3:27:47.200 --> 3:27:52.320]  mouse, you know, does something or, you know, he has some talks with his parents. I mean,
[3:27:52.320 --> 3:27:56.560]  look at the little Leave It To Beaver shows, right? Why couldn't you do something like that?
[3:27:57.600 --> 3:28:07.440]  Why introduce children to the occult? What was it about that that Disney loved? Hmm. You got to
[3:28:07.440 --> 3:28:11.920]  think about that for a moment because he was surrounded by this kind of stuff. He had a love
[3:28:11.920 --> 3:28:18.000]  for this kind of stuff. And nobody really saw it. In fact, he wasn't really good. Why would you
[3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:22.800]  pursue a career in animation if you could only hold down a job for a couple of months because
[3:28:22.800 --> 3:28:29.600]  you're not good? He was fired. Why would you do that? Why would you consistently pursue, pursue,
[3:28:29.600 --> 3:28:35.920]  pursue? I think there was an agenda there, do you think? And the Sorcerer's Apprentice was an
[3:28:35.920 --> 3:28:40.560]  interesting film to kind of come out with. And are there movies where they show Mickey Mouse
[3:28:40.560 --> 3:28:46.000]  sorting cocaine? Oh, he'd be the judge. There's a lot of different plots and movies. I'll get
[3:28:46.000 --> 3:28:49.760]  back to this in just a moment. I'm Kate Deli, your guest host for the Alex Jones Show.
[3:28:56.480 --> 3:29:01.520]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor,
[3:29:01.520 --> 3:29:06.560]  a lawyer, or a millionaire. Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles. You see it
[3:29:06.560 --> 3:29:11.440]  every year. 30 different tax returns, 30 different answers. 50 different tax returns, 50 different
[3:29:11.440 --> 3:29:17.360]  answers. And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax
[3:29:17.360 --> 3:29:21.680]  groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[3:29:21.680 --> 3:29:26.560]  this and knowing this show. It's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out
[3:29:26.560 --> 3:29:33.120]  there hurting everybody. To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you
[3:29:33.120 --> 3:29:37.360]  to keep more of your money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the
[3:29:37.360 --> 3:29:44.800]  last few years. The only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com, one word

[3:29:56.160 --> 3:30:01.600]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual
[3:30:01.600 --> 3:30:07.360]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages. And the studies are all clear. The number one cause
[3:30:07.360 --> 3:30:14.160]  of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom. And the number one issue men have
[3:30:14.160 --> 3:30:19.680]  is a rectile dysfunction. Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they
[3:30:19.680 --> 3:30:24.480]  don't want people having lasting good, loving relationships. They want to break up society.
[3:30:24.480 --> 3:30:32.000]  And we are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world available

[3:33:11.120 --> 3:33:15.280]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm Kate Daly, your guest host from KateDalyRadio.com.
[3:33:15.280 --> 3:33:21.280]  So I'm talking a little bit about the history of the occult in media and in film and all of the
[3:33:21.280 --> 3:33:24.720]  ways we've been indoctrinated and all of the things that are available to us that we don't
[3:33:24.720 --> 3:33:29.760]  even think about because they're just kind of cool. I mean, come on. It's a crystal. I mean,
[3:33:29.760 --> 3:33:34.720]  it's cool, right? We don't even think about what we're doing anymore. We're on autopilot
[3:33:34.720 --> 3:33:42.320]  much of the time. So while Disney has all these subsidiaries, Touchstone, Miramax, Hollywood
[3:33:42.320 --> 3:33:46.400]  Pictures, just think for a second all the films that Miramax puts out in Touchstone.
[3:33:48.640 --> 3:33:55.440]  So there's a lot of themes in those films. And what were they devised for? Why do you
[3:33:55.440 --> 3:34:01.360]  need all these subsidiaries, right? They were created to camouflage the Disney production of
[3:34:02.320 --> 3:34:07.520]  a lot of filth to tell you the truth. I know I'm going to sound like a 90-year-old little
[3:34:07.520 --> 3:34:13.680]  church lady, but that's not... It's really and truly it was about hiding really what they really
[3:34:13.680 --> 3:34:19.360]  wanted to get into because if Disney's associated with it, everybody's guard is down, right? So
[3:34:19.360 --> 3:34:25.760]  they operate in kind of a clandestine manner, really. And they were all on board as well during
[3:34:25.760 --> 3:34:30.480]  World War II for developing World War II propaganda films. I mean, if you look all along,
[3:34:30.480 --> 3:34:38.000]  who gets the awards? Disney. Why is he so awarded? He didn't have a huge amount of talent. He had to
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:43.200]  have other people draw his stuff. Why was he so awarded? They even called him the Golden Boy.
[3:34:43.200 --> 3:34:48.000]  There was so much good press about this guy from Time Warner and from all of these different
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:53.520]  movie companies. They loved him, gave him chance after chance, even when his companies kept going
[3:34:53.520 --> 3:34:57.600]  bankrupt in the beginning because he couldn't manage a company, right? He brought on his brother
[3:34:57.600 --> 3:35:04.000]  Roy. And they still made these contracts with him. Why would you make a contract with a business
[3:35:04.000 --> 3:35:10.560]  that goes bankrupt? It doesn't make any sense, right? So in the 1920 films, he shows kids cutting
[3:35:10.560 --> 3:35:14.640]  school, shoplifting, playing hooky, all the really good messages you want your kids to see.
[3:35:15.200 --> 3:35:19.840]  And he shows Alice running away from her responsibility to have an adventure. He shows
[3:35:19.840 --> 3:35:26.240]  prisoners escaping and hobos and escaping work and all of these different things, right? Misbehaving.
[3:35:26.240 --> 3:35:32.080]  And you think, oh, he's just showing cute little kids doing fun little things, you know? Who doesn't
[3:35:32.080 --> 3:35:41.840]  shoplift and play hooky? Me? I don't. Anyway, so in the 1951 cartoon, Get Rich Quick Goofy wins
[3:35:41.840 --> 3:35:48.160]  money at poker. And initially, his angry wife, who doesn't even love to gamble, right? She just,
[3:35:48.160 --> 3:35:53.680]  of course, forgives him and then sees, why? Because she sees how much money he's won.
[3:35:53.680 --> 3:36:01.280]  What a great lesson for children. I love that, right? Easy come, easy go, right? And so, of course,
[3:36:01.280 --> 3:36:06.640]  you know, being shown gambling, countless acts of violence, they couldn't do all of these acts
[3:36:06.640 --> 3:36:12.000]  of violence on film at the time. Think 100 years ago. They couldn't do this. So what did they do?
[3:36:12.000 --> 3:36:19.680]  They put it into film. They put it into film. I have a mallet for cooking. And one of my kids,
[3:36:19.680 --> 3:36:24.480]  who will remain nameless, took the mallet and bonked one of my other kids on the head.
[3:36:24.480 --> 3:36:28.880]  Why did they do that? Because they saw it in a cartoon. They saw it in a cartoon. They wanted,
[3:36:28.880 --> 3:36:32.400]  they didn't think it would do anything because the character that got bonked on the head,
[3:36:32.400 --> 3:36:40.320]  certainly fine, right? I mean, they're going to do what they see. And this is what they were seeing
[3:36:40.320 --> 3:36:45.440]  all the time. Do you remember your childhood without Disney? I grew up near Disneyland.
[3:36:45.440 --> 3:36:50.800]  Everything I did was at Disneyland. Grad night and dates and everything was Disney. So my whole
[3:36:50.800 --> 3:36:55.600]  childhood, I have great memories. It's kind of like watching the movie Greece. When I was little,
[3:36:55.600 --> 3:36:59.440]  I didn't know it was about sex. You don't pick up on that. You just like the music or you think
[3:36:59.440 --> 3:37:05.920]  it's a cute story. So we see with the eyes we want to see and that's okay to a certain degree
[3:37:05.920 --> 3:37:10.080]  because we have goodness in us. We're not going to go and see that his club 33 and you think of
[3:37:10.080 --> 3:37:16.960]  the 33 Mason. You're not going to make those associations. But the problem is that we're
[3:37:16.960 --> 3:37:20.240]  still doing this with our children now and we don't even realize what we're doing.
[3:37:21.200 --> 3:37:24.000]  That's what it is. It's autopilot. You've got to get out of autopilot.
[3:37:24.800 --> 3:37:28.400]  And otherwise, you're going to have to have a lot of talks with your kids after every movie
[3:37:28.400 --> 3:37:34.560]  they watch, honestly. And so we put them in front of a Disney movie not thinking at all.
[3:37:34.560 --> 3:37:40.160]  And when children see horrible deaths on TV, they learn to associate the suffering with
[3:37:40.160 --> 3:37:45.920]  entertainment and pleasure and their favorite soft drink and a little box of goobers. You know?
[3:37:46.880 --> 3:37:55.440]  This is the kind of thing that is mind control. Illuminati loves this kind of stuff. And of
[3:37:55.440 --> 3:38:00.320]  course, you've got all these violent images they're being shown. But the family's like,
[3:38:00.320 --> 3:38:06.240]  oh, we're at a Disney movie. This is fabulous, isn't it? We're here. The Disney Gargoyle's cartoon
[3:38:06.240 --> 3:38:12.480]  was a television series about pure demonology and the storyline that a race of demons protects in
[3:38:12.480 --> 3:38:18.880]  New York City. Really? I thought it was made of that. Anyways. Yeah, it's a lovely city.
[3:38:19.440 --> 3:38:27.040]  So according to ex Illuminati slaves, you know, the 1960s had to shift their programming away
[3:38:27.040 --> 3:38:31.920]  from the military bases at the time because there was too much publicity and too much heat
[3:38:31.920 --> 3:38:37.120]  shining on military at the time. And they really didn't want people to understand what was really
[3:38:37.120 --> 3:38:43.360]  behind the wars, right? They really didn't. And so the goal was to have a place where you could
[3:38:43.360 --> 3:38:49.520]  have these... It became America. Disney is very famous for America. It's got its monument. When
[3:38:49.520 --> 3:38:54.560]  you go to America for the first time, you got to go to Disneyland, Disney World, don't you?
[3:38:54.560 --> 3:39:00.240]  Yeah. And the ones around the world, I can't even talk today, the ones around the world
[3:39:00.800 --> 3:39:05.440]  don't do as well. Yet they're completely propped up. In a real business world,
[3:39:05.440 --> 3:39:09.200]  you'd be out, kind of like CNN. CNN has, what, about 200,000 followers?
[3:39:10.160 --> 3:39:15.760]  Yeah, the total zombies among us. Well, in a regular business world, CNN wouldn't be on TV
[3:39:15.760 --> 3:39:21.040]  because, you know, free market capitalism, you don't have the crowd, right? Totally bolstered up.
[3:39:21.040 --> 3:39:29.040]  Interesting. So from an early time, he was very much in with the government and the government
[3:39:29.040 --> 3:39:35.040]  helping in control the projects, what they were doing. And I think it was more so than people
[3:39:35.040 --> 3:39:42.640]  realize. I told you I would talk just a little bit about the secret. This is interesting because
[3:39:42.640 --> 3:39:47.200]  there was an exposé about the secret. Now, the secret is Rhonda Burns' book. And this book is
[3:39:47.200 --> 3:39:52.960]  all about, you know, your intention. You will things to happen, okay? And you could probably
[3:39:52.960 --> 3:39:58.080]  think that's a good idea. I think there is something to that in positive thinking and the
[3:39:58.080 --> 3:40:02.480]  effect it can have on your body and different things, your thoughts are who you are, right?
[3:40:02.480 --> 3:40:07.680]  So there is some truth there. The problem is, is that this book was all about, hey,
[3:40:07.680 --> 3:40:11.680]  there's this stealthy secret. And this is the secret to your relationships, your happiness,
[3:40:11.680 --> 3:40:16.720]  your eternal youth. You're not fat because you ate a lot. You just haven't thought away the
[3:40:16.720 --> 3:40:22.000]  fatness enough. It was basically go make a vision board and make it happen. Don't rely on God.
[3:40:22.000 --> 3:40:27.040]  Don't pray about it. No, you need to get into the laws of attraction because it's all about the
[3:40:27.040 --> 3:40:32.880]  laws of attraction. So the focus was extreme, okay? What's interesting about the secret is,
[3:40:33.440 --> 3:40:40.320]  is that witches actually came out, actual witches and said, hey, that's what we do. The secret is,
[3:40:40.320 --> 3:40:47.360]  that's witchcraft. That's what we're doing. We're willfully, intentionally wanting something to
[3:40:47.360 --> 3:40:53.280]  happen as they're chanting around a cauldron. That's what witchcraft is. But it was being
[3:40:53.280 --> 3:40:59.920]  sold to us in a new package. And the new package was new age, hey, be part of this new secret.
[3:40:59.920 --> 3:41:05.600]  You can will away your problems. And then materialistically, you can will into your life
[3:41:05.600 --> 3:41:12.080]  everything that you want. There's nothing stopping you. Why is that? See, if you think
[3:41:12.080 --> 3:41:16.320]  bad thoughts, bad things will happen. If you think good thoughts, everything good will happen to you.
[3:41:16.320 --> 3:41:22.000]  You can create your circumstances. Do you see anything about God in that equation?
[3:41:22.000 --> 3:41:28.480]  No, it leaves God out completely. That's the problem. It's an extreme. Is there something
[3:41:28.480 --> 3:41:35.760]  too good thoughts? Sure, sure. But it isn't what they're selling it as. It's a really super seductive
[3:41:35.760 --> 3:41:41.200]  message, actually, is the secret. And so a lot of people when I said, you know, people are getting
[3:41:41.200 --> 3:41:46.080]  into things that they normally wouldn't. This would not be something that they would normally,
[3:41:46.080 --> 3:41:51.600]  you know, but they accept it. You know, they accept it because it's part of everything they're
[3:41:51.600 --> 3:41:56.960]  seeing around us. And so you might have a couple friends with some vision boards. They're not bad
[3:41:56.960 --> 3:42:02.720]  people. They just think that this is a new secret to be to behold, that they can actually create
[3:42:02.720 --> 3:42:08.880]  their universe this way. You know, I believe in the power of prayer. So a different line of thinking,
[3:42:08.880 --> 3:42:14.000]  a different philosophy, if you will, going back to iron round, a different philosophy, a different
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:18.800]  foundation. And so if we don't recognize these things, and how we're kind of being swept into
[3:42:18.800 --> 3:42:23.840]  this, because we have six out of 10 Americans subscribing to something in their life that's
[3:42:23.840 --> 3:42:30.000]  really going new age, without really being told that it is a facet of the occult, no matter how
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:35.120]  you look at it. It's a facet of it. And parents aren't letting their kids know this. We're still
[3:42:35.120 --> 3:42:40.080]  dragging them to Disney movies. And we're weeding out the good ones. Is there a few good ones? Sure.
[3:42:40.640 --> 3:42:45.360]  They would have to. They would have to put a few cute ones in there, have missed all the magic,
[3:42:45.360 --> 3:42:50.960]  but ask yourself this, why all the magic in every single movie? Why? Why does it have to be there?
[3:42:50.960 --> 3:42:53.760]  I'll be right back. I'm Kay Daly, your guest host for the Alex Jones show.

[3:46:46.160 --> 3:46:51.040]  are coming together. They really are sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that want to
[3:46:51.040 --> 3:46:55.120]  domesticate us and turn us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue.
[3:46:57.840 --> 3:47:03.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:03.840 --> 3:47:15.680]  Welcome back to the Kate Daly show. I'm sorry. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:15.680 --> 3:47:21.840]  It's habit. I'm so sorry. I'm Kate Daly, your guest host. It's habit from and thanks Alex for
[3:47:21.840 --> 3:47:27.200]  having me on today. And let me just tell you this. The left is fascinated with the occult
[3:47:27.200 --> 3:47:31.920]  magic and magical thinking. And now that you know that and you're thinking of those words,
[3:47:31.920 --> 3:47:37.840]  listen to the stuff they say, listen to the things they phrase, you will hear magic more than you've
[3:47:37.840 --> 3:47:43.920]  ever heard, especially coming from the media. And Hollywood in Hollywood, liberals have no
[3:47:43.920 --> 3:47:48.960]  other choice since the 1940s since the inception of the CIA, which is kind of an interesting
[3:47:48.960 --> 3:47:56.480]  connection. They have absolutely, you have absolutely, you have to support codify and
[3:47:56.480 --> 3:48:04.880]  support liberal values. If you don't, you're done. You're done. Your career won't happen.
[3:48:04.880 --> 3:48:10.880]  There's only a scamp few that ever still have a career after they say, well, I'm a conservative or
[3:48:10.880 --> 3:48:16.960]  I don't like all of this stuff happening. And so you look back at all the things that we have
[3:48:17.680 --> 3:48:22.800]  really sort of placed a huge importance on. The Harry Potter book series, did J.K. Rowling
[3:48:22.800 --> 3:48:29.600]  really write that? Or was there other people involved in making sure that we had the field
[3:48:29.600 --> 3:48:36.320]  of child wizardry? Because those films very, very popular, but because it was based on a book,
[3:48:36.320 --> 3:48:42.320]  parents went, oh, it's based on a book. Books are good. Not all books. What are we teaching the kids?
[3:48:43.200 --> 3:48:47.200]  There's mysteries and there's all kinds of things that can happen. And this is where
[3:48:47.200 --> 3:48:53.760]  people kind of, they don't realize those things can happen without all the occult stuff. But why
[3:48:53.760 --> 3:49:01.200]  are we so enamored with this? Why do we love movies with spells and witchcraft in the occult?
[3:49:01.200 --> 3:49:07.360]  Because that's all we've been shown for about 100 years. That's why. 110 years. So there's a
[3:49:07.360 --> 3:49:15.120]  whole darker side to this, this magic and it occupies in medicine and all kinds of roles. I
[3:49:15.120 --> 3:49:20.720]  mean, it really, it does a number on our brain because we're so used to it. So witches, when I
[3:49:20.720 --> 3:49:26.000]  was talking about the secret, witches, this is from an actual witch who wrote this, witchcraft
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:30.240]  is about harnessing your power and using it alongside the power of the universe to manifest a life
[3:49:30.240 --> 3:49:36.080]  that fulfills your higher purpose. Intention simply tells those energies where you want to go next.
[3:49:36.640 --> 3:49:40.720]  Practicing intention forces you to ground yourself and do some self-reflection
[3:49:40.720 --> 3:49:46.880]  and meditate on what you really want from life. These are the vital skills. Oh, yes, they're so
[3:49:46.880 --> 3:49:53.680]  vital. That every witch should possess and constantly improve. I'm creeped out right now. Reading that.
[3:49:54.640 --> 3:49:59.840]  I mean, you could swap that and put it into the secret mentality, the secret book, and it would
[3:49:59.840 --> 3:50:07.520]  be that you're saying the same thing, aren't you? So Anton Leves tells the New Age to give
[3:50:07.520 --> 3:50:13.760]  Satan his religion back. The New Age, he says, is a spiritual Satanism repackaged in a box of
[3:50:13.760 --> 3:50:19.600]  social morality wrapped in wrapping paper of unity and social progress, just like the phrase I just
[3:50:19.600 --> 3:50:24.560]  read from you from a witch and topped off with a bow of love and tolerance. It's all about love and
[3:50:24.560 --> 3:50:32.320]  tolerance. It is spiritual principles of Satanism mixed in with appealing heart-centered moral system
[3:50:32.320 --> 3:50:41.920]  where Satan gets replaced with the therapeutic imagery idea of source. But of all the actual
[3:50:41.920 --> 3:50:46.240]  subjects in the New Age that have to do with the occultic and spiritual matters that have their roots
[3:50:46.240 --> 3:50:51.120]  in Luciferian philosophy, just because the New Age sprinkles in a self-esteem message
[3:50:51.120 --> 3:50:57.600]  and endorses an appealing standard of social morality, social morality, social justice and
[3:50:57.600 --> 3:51:02.720]  morality in a sentence, that's sort of strange, and endorses an appealing standard of this,
[3:51:02.720 --> 3:51:07.120]  does not mean that the New Age subjects themselves are not essentially satanic.
[3:51:07.920 --> 3:51:13.200]  We've just gotten really used to it. That's the problem. And so you have all this seductive
[3:51:13.200 --> 3:51:19.360]  messaging. And what's interesting too, if you go back and you kind of look from 1910 on,
[3:51:19.360 --> 3:51:26.320]  in 19, around 1910, the magic circle was formed in London. No, 1905. This was the magic circle.
[3:51:26.320 --> 3:51:31.440]  It was formed in London and it was the advance to advance the art of stage magic. Think about all
[3:51:31.440 --> 3:51:37.680]  the magicians that are in Vegas. You think about all these things that actually were associated
[3:51:37.680 --> 3:51:43.200]  with much darker things 200 years ago, but now they're the mainstream. We've accepted it as
[3:51:43.200 --> 3:51:52.000]  full entertainment. And so we have the theatrical venues, the TV, and of course street magic,
[3:51:52.000 --> 3:51:58.080]  all of these different things. So who is a member of that? Prince Charles. Prince Charles is a
[3:51:58.080 --> 3:52:05.200]  member of the magic circle in London. There's a lot of people that are members of this. And there's
[3:52:05.200 --> 3:52:09.360]  this expression, it's all done with smoke and mirrors, kind of like our life right now. How
[3:52:09.360 --> 3:52:15.280]  Truman is the Truman Show? Well, we're in it and it's hard to see out. It's hard to see what we
[3:52:15.280 --> 3:52:20.480]  have been indoctrinated with through the years. But this is kind of strange. At the same time,
[3:52:20.480 --> 3:52:25.520]  they came up with what was called, they built the magic castle. Now this was a building that was
[3:52:25.520 --> 3:52:30.400]  built and then taken over for the same exact purpose as the magic circle in London in LA.
[3:52:30.400 --> 3:52:36.240]  We had the magic castle. It's a clubhouse for magicians. And there was an ex CIA agent that
[3:52:36.240 --> 3:52:41.840]  was saying, I don't know about ex, are they ever ex? Anyway, saying this is where a lot of the CIA
[3:52:41.840 --> 3:52:46.400]  is trained to do their little sleight of hand and their little tricks. And this place is,
[3:52:46.400 --> 3:52:53.360]  well, it's creepy. It's the truth. It's located right smack in Hollyweird in LA and builds itself as
[3:52:53.360 --> 3:52:58.320]  the most unusual private club in the world. Now I didn't want to pick on anybody, but guess who's
[3:52:58.320 --> 3:53:04.320]  a member of that? Johnny Carson. Johnny Carson was a member of this magic castle club. And he was
[3:53:04.320 --> 3:53:10.320]  intrigued by magic from the age of 12 years on up. And he joined the Navy at 17. What most people
[3:53:10.320 --> 3:53:14.160]  don't know about, it's kind of a side note, but what most people don't know about Johnny Carson is
[3:53:14.160 --> 3:53:24.160]  that he was, he scored so high in intelligence and psychologically that he was put into a V 12
[3:53:24.160 --> 3:53:30.720]  program in during World War II. And the V 12 program hit all kinds of religious institutions
[3:53:30.720 --> 3:53:38.080]  and colleges. And they would kind of promise these guys kind of, you know, this these key roles in
[3:53:38.080 --> 3:53:45.440]  intelligence. Okay. So a lot of what they were really doing was promoting intelligence, curating
[3:53:45.440 --> 3:53:51.360]  for CIA intelligence at the time, and trying to decide who they wanted to pick, who, you know,
[3:53:51.360 --> 3:53:56.560]  was the smartest guy in the room to be part of this crew. And he started, you know, of course,
[3:53:56.560 --> 3:54:01.920]  deciphering messages in the military and all kinds of things. It's very interesting to me how many
[3:54:01.920 --> 3:54:09.040]  Hollywood types since the 1940s were in the military and military programs in military
[3:54:09.040 --> 3:54:14.560]  intelligence programs. Johnny Carson was one of them. Do you ever wonder how people get famous?
[3:54:14.560 --> 3:54:19.280]  Do you ever wonder why certain people are promoted over others? It's kind of strange, isn't it?
[3:54:20.400 --> 3:54:27.200]  So this particular program, kind of like the Army Specialized Training Program, were to spit out,
[3:54:27.200 --> 3:54:33.360]  you know, into such fields as engineering, you know, really good people in their field, right,
[3:54:33.920 --> 3:54:40.640]  that would also kind of work for the intelligence, wink, wink, in engineering foreign languages and
[3:54:40.640 --> 3:54:46.240]  medicine, all kinds of things. So they took in all of these people. Now, who was among that kind
[3:54:46.240 --> 3:54:54.720]  of group that he came out of? Oh, Henry Kissinger, Mel Brooks, right, Mel Brooks, Frank Church, Bob
[3:54:54.720 --> 3:55:05.040]  Dole, Ed Goodell Ed, New York City Mayor, and a whole bunch of people, Gorvindal, all kinds of people
[3:55:05.040 --> 3:55:10.640]  in media and prominent positions, isn't that always kind of interest you how many people end up?
[3:55:11.200 --> 3:55:16.400]  Robert Kennedy, Paul Newman, Jackie Cooper, Zeke... Zeke Zeeger,
[3:55:16.400 --> 3:55:22.240]  Warren Christopher, and Carol Earl Carol, the judges. A lot of people end up in these programs.
[3:55:22.240 --> 3:55:27.400]  Isn't it interesting how many people end up in our media and end up very popular with
[3:55:27.400 --> 3:55:31.720]  a career laid out? Same with Johnny Carson. He had a whole career laid out for him. He
[3:55:31.720 --> 3:55:37.520]  didn't have to struggle. He got in there very quick. He got prominent positions very quickly.
[3:55:37.520 --> 3:55:43.720]  Why? They're all part of a club. Not everybody in Hollywood is in this club. There's a lot
[3:55:43.720 --> 3:55:48.280]  of people that, oh, I would jump through the hoops and we'll do what they do, what they're
[3:55:48.280 --> 3:55:53.560]  paid to do or have a certain bend towards some of the things I've been talking about
[3:55:53.560 --> 3:55:58.720]  and they just sort of like this industry. And I would say Disney really worked for the
[3:55:58.720 --> 3:56:03.240]  government as he was developing his company because he had to depend on loans. He had
[3:56:03.240 --> 3:56:08.720]  to depend on certain things to happen for his company to succeed because his messaging
[3:56:08.720 --> 3:56:15.640]  wasn't that popular as far as with the audiences. It was more of a media presence to say, he's
[3:56:15.640 --> 3:56:21.480]  the man. He's the golden boy. This is what you should look at and so people did. It was
[3:56:21.480 --> 3:56:26.560]  very coerced. And a lot of people don't know that about Johnny Carson. A lot of people
[3:56:26.560 --> 3:56:31.880]  are intelligence programs in the media for a reason. You've got all your journalists.
[3:56:31.880 --> 3:56:38.240]  You've got so many people in politics that have been indoctrinated into intelligence
[3:56:38.240 --> 3:56:44.240]  programs for a reason. They want to control people at the helm and they want to make sure
[3:56:44.240 --> 3:56:49.160]  that certain messages get out and certain messages don't. This is how it goes.
[3:56:49.160 --> 3:56:53.960]  I have so much more on this. I could actually do a whole nother hour on this and maybe I'll
[3:56:53.960 --> 3:56:59.880]  do a continuation next week because there's so much here. I barely touched on it. But
[3:56:59.880 --> 3:57:05.240]  on my show this week, I will be talking about on Friday, 9-11 and you know, there's a lot
[3:57:05.240 --> 3:57:09.360]  to learn about 9-11, a lot of stuff that's come out that we need to talk about because
[3:57:09.360 --> 3:57:13.480]  it's been enough years. It's been enough years that we really need to be red-pilled. We need
[3:57:13.480 --> 3:57:17.240]  to really kind of see what's been going on with that as well.
[3:57:17.240 --> 3:57:21.360]  And with this, we've been indoctrinated into this sort of thinking and into this occult.
[3:57:21.360 --> 3:57:26.360]  If you really look at the big picture, the last 100 years, think about why we needed
[3:57:26.360 --> 3:57:31.600]  these things. And by the way, why did they need so many intelligence programs for the
[3:57:31.600 --> 3:57:36.200]  war if all we did was invite the Nazis back to be in our country and head up certain divisions?
[3:57:36.200 --> 3:57:41.520]  It doesn't make sense, does it? Maybe the war was an excuse to build the CIA. Who knows?
[3:57:41.520 --> 3:57:47.000]  I'm Kate Deli, your guest host for the Alex Jones Show.

[3:58:46.800 --> 3:58:52.800]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[3:58:52.800 --> 3:58:57.360]  and chemicals added to the food. It's all come out. And they're doing that not because
[3:58:57.360 --> 3:59:02.360]  we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful.
[3:59:02.360 --> 3:59:07.800]  And the social engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that famous internet
[3:59:07.800 --> 3:59:14.920]  saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true. The propaganda would
[3:59:14.920 --> 3:59:21.240]  not be necessary if the situation was hopeless. They need all their propaganda and all their
[3:59:21.240 --> 3:59:28.200]  lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and
[3:59:28.200 --> 3:59:32.640]  they know in the end they signed on the God of this world who is a loser. And that's why
[3:59:32.640 --> 3:59:36.360]  it's so important that everybody keep them full wars in the air now more than ever. Because
[3:59:36.360 --> 3:59:40.360]  even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up
[3:59:40.360 --> 3:59:44.960]  is J. Chan. And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they
[3:59:44.960 --> 3:59:45.960]  just announced.
[3:59:45.960 --> 3:59:58.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
