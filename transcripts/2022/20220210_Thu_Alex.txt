[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  Infowars. The most banned network in the world.
[00:20.000 --> 00:25.000]  Sedition, insurrection, a threat to democracy.
[00:25.000 --> 00:28.000]  This city is under siege. They are now calling it an occupation.
[00:28.000 --> 00:29.000]  Alarming situation there in Ottawa.
[00:29.000 --> 00:34.000]  The police chief is calling it a nationwide insurrection driven by madness.
[00:34.000 --> 00:37.000]  I think it's part of the globalization of Trump as Canadians know where I stand.
[00:37.000 --> 00:40.000]  There hasn't been as much violence as some had perhaps projected,
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.000]  but that does not necessarily mean that it has been peaceful.
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  Residents say they feel like hostages.
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  Some protesters harassed a soup kitchen.
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  These anti-vaxxers actually took food from the mouths of the homeless.
[00:52.000 --> 00:53.000]  Hungry, yeah.
[00:53.000 --> 01:02.000]  Because they're so put upon. The small fringe minority of people who are on their way to Ottawa
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  or who are holding unacceptable views that they're expressing.
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.000]  Many of them are holding Confederate flags.
[01:11.000 --> 01:13.000]  I've heard there's QAnon supporters in the crowd.
[01:13.000 --> 01:16.000]  We've seen swastikas. We've seen the Confederate flag.
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  This is a story of a country that got through this pandemic by being united
[01:20.000 --> 01:28.000]  and a few people shouting and waving swastikas does not define who Canadians are.
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.000]  It's a cult.
[01:32.000 --> 01:33.000]  Yes, it is.
[01:33.000 --> 01:40.000]  The big issue here is that the truckers and their horns are, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.000]  the sound of freedom.
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.000]  You hear that eerie sound?
[01:46.000 --> 01:52.000]  It's not when they find the obelisk on the moon in 2001 Space Odyssey.
[01:52.000 --> 02:02.000]  It is the very eerie sound of tens of thousands of trucks and cars
[02:02.000 --> 02:10.000]  honking their horns 24 hours a day in the capital of the seized nation
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  under globalist control, Canada.
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  It's a beautiful example of nonviolent resistance and solidarity,
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.000]  and so that's why they're calling them terrorists.
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.000]  This is a rally for truckers, but it's also a rally for the 60% of Canadians
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  who say they worry they can't afford food.
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.000]  It's for the 60-year-old small businessman who spent his entire adult life
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  building up an enterprise and watching him wiped out.
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  It's for the depressed 14-year-old who's been locked out of school.
[02:41.000 --> 02:44.000]  It's for the families that can't take it anymore.
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  It's for the people who want to stand up and speak for their freedoms.
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.000]  It's for all those that our government and our media have insulted and left behind.
[02:54.000 --> 02:55.000]  This is treason.
[02:55.000 --> 02:57.000]  This is way bigger.
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.000]  This is a group of well-polished, professional people that are trying to overthrow
[03:03.000 --> 03:09.000]  the government, the democratically elected government of this country.
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  This is not a target on the city of Ottawa.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.000]  It's much bigger than that.
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  It's really an insurrection.
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  It's an attack on our democracy.
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.000]  It's an attack on our federal government.
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.000]  It has a lot of international elements to it.
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.000]  The money is flowing from the U.S.
[03:27.000 --> 03:29.000]  This was right out of the Trump playbook.
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.000]  These globalists trick us with people like Trump,
[03:33.000 --> 03:34.000]  and I'm not saying Trump's overall bad,
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  but by bringing him in, making the left hate him to get the left to do things as a general public
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  they would never go along with.
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.000]  And then now we get so mad at the left,
[03:43.000 --> 03:46.000]  when the right wing gets in power it will then do things to stop them,
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.000]  and in the end of the day all of our liberties are gone.
[03:49.000 --> 03:50.000]  All of our freedoms are gone,
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  and wars of global domination take place,
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  because make no mistake,
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.000]  they're not setting up censorship systems and AI control grids and kill switches everywhere
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  because they want to take Alex Jones off the air, Joe Rogan off the air.
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  They want to take everybody off the air.
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  You will only get prescribed communications in the system that's coming.
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.000]  You're not going to get the open free internet anymore under the nuclear war plan,
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  under the biological weapon plan,
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  and those are just two of the plans.
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  Then they've also got the giant cyber attack they're going to blame on Russia
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.000]  or our patriotic groups already pre-planning
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.000]  and preparing the mines out there with that information.
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  It's more likely we're going to end up, if we end up in a war,
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  a real shooting war with a major power,
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  it's going to be the consequence of a cyber breach of great consequence.
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  So, I love my family, and I love all of you,
[04:45.000 --> 05:01.000]  and I just need to tell you that you need to get ready for absolute hell on earth.
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.000]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock.
[05:05.000 --> 05:08.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing,
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  our products are game changing,
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  and so many people are deficient in iodide.
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  It's not the soil anymore.
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  Most of the ocean is contaminated,
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  but when you get high quality tri-iodine,
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.000]  all three of the healthy types together,
[05:22.000 --> 05:26.000]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido,
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  but most importantly your immune system.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  So, X3, the only tri-iodine on the market,
[05:32.000 --> 05:38.000]  highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine,
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  it takes about two weeks to get clean on average,
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  you really need to experience X3.
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it,
[05:47.000 --> 05:48.000]  I know you're going to be reordering it,
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  but particularly those that haven't ever tried the product,
[05:50.000 --> 05:53.000]  you need it because it's amazing what does for your body,
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.000]  it's the good halogen, not the bad halogen,
[05:55.000 --> 05:58.000]  and it funds the info war, a true 360 win.
[05:58.000 --> 06:00.000]  So again, X3, back in stock.
[06:00.000 --> 06:13.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:13.000 --> 06:19.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:25.000 --> 06:29.000]  Well, the dictator of Canada's biological brother,
[06:29.000 --> 06:32.000]  they got the same mother who's going to be joining us.
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.000]  He's got all the inside baseball and he's broken his silence
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.000]  like so many of the Royal Mount of Police and local police
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  and bureaucrats have saying this is evil,
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  this is a planned permanent takeover, a great reset.
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  He's a really smart fellow and we look forward to Kyle Kemper,
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.000]  Trudeau's half-brother joining us in the second hour today.
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.000]  Paul Joseph Watson blows the fourth hour from London, England,
[06:55.000 --> 06:59.000]  and then Owen Schreuer, the mighty Cuck Slayer,
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.000]  will be hosting the fourth hour.
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.000]  And before the federal government says that,
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  he actually killed people, that's a turn of phrase
[07:07.000 --> 07:11.000]  from his debating skills over the years when he was dubbed that
[07:11.000 --> 07:15.000]  six years ago or so online as the Cuck destroyer.
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  Okay, and the Cuck destroyer can be heard weekdays
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.000]  at 3 p.m. central when my broadcast ends.
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  You know, I want to talk about the big picture here
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.000]  and I really want this to sink in because I know that
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  we have millions of listeners who are the tip of the spear
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  of the human awakening.
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  And we also have Senator Paul listening.
[07:37.000 --> 07:42.000]  We have people like Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan listen quite a bit.
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.000]  And a lot of other important people listen.
[07:45.000 --> 07:49.000]  I don't want to be very, very, very clear about something here
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.000]  because these are two similar things.
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  It's fun to make fun of Biden and how he can't think
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.000]  and how he's a joke and it makes the Democrats look like fools.
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.000]  But in the end, he'll get the blame for all the tyranny
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  and they won't, that's why they put him in there
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  to be a laughing stock while they wreck the country
[08:05.000 --> 08:08.000]  and then hope you never figure out it was part of the great reset.
[08:08.000 --> 08:11.000]  Klaus Schwab, the UN, the IMF, the World Bank talk about
[08:11.000 --> 08:14.000]  wrecking countries which they've done all over the world
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.000]  and making sure no one ever knows who did it to them.
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  Because as soon as you figure out who's doing it
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  and what the carbon taxes are
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  and what the global warming greenhouse BS is about
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.000]  and what all the racism obsession is about
[08:27.000 --> 08:31.000]  and what all this is about, then it's game over for them.
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  So it feels good to get up here and say,
[08:33.000 --> 08:37.000]  man, the whole leftist system is in trouble worldwide
[08:37.000 --> 08:41.000]  and these politicians are hated in France and in the UK
[08:41.000 --> 08:44.000]  and in Germany and in Canada.
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  But see, the puppets come and go.
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  They get rewarded after with their $10 million a year corporate CEO jobs
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  and presidential jobs of corporations
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  where they just play golf all day
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.000]  and then a new group of the next generation
[08:59.000 --> 09:04.000]  or the new alumni of Klaus Schwab's Bilderberg
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  World Government DeBose Group World Economic Forum system
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  like shark teeth roll into position.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  So I want to point out the whole pedigree of this
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  and who's doing it and how it's happening and how we stop it.
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.000]  Because we have a global waking to that, it's game over.
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  And that's starting to happen really fast and that's really good
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.000]  and once you see it, you can't unsee it.
[09:27.000 --> 09:33.000]  I've had two star generals and you name it across the board
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  just say, man, I never got it until I sort of listened to you
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  and then once I saw it, I didn't need to listen to you anymore
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  because I could see it myself and it's dead on
[09:41.000 --> 09:44.000]  and now things that don't make sense just make total sense.
[09:44.000 --> 09:46.000]  I'm not telling you what to think.
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.000]  I'm saying, hey, you can't see this image from here.
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  Step three feet over here.
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  Just come right here.
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.000]  What do you see right there?
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  Yeah, now you see it, don't you?
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  So first you can't see it, now you do see it.
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  So just like we celebrate what an idiot buy this
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  and I hate his guts and I hate the Democratic Party
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  and they're all just a bunch of scum
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.000]  but they're just criminals they put in there to take the heat
[10:09.000 --> 10:12.000]  while they all inside our trade and screw us over.
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  And it's the same thing with the end to the lockdowns.
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  Remember a year and a half ago, more than a year and a half ago
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  I said after this goes on for six months or so
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.000]  they're going to pull back some of the pressure around the world
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.000]  and then they'll just bring it right back even stronger the next time.
[10:31.000 --> 10:34.000]  And if you actually look at what they're really doing
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  versus the rhetoric, they have only been tightening down
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  all over the world the last two years
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  except in some western and midwestern and southern states of the U.S.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  that didn't go along with it.
[10:46.000 --> 10:49.000]  Hell, much of Latin America is still under total lockdown, martial law.
[10:49.000 --> 10:53.000]  A lot of Africa is still under it.
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  France, Germany, it's getting more intense.
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  Austria forced door-to-door injections.
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  Germany is announcing it's about to start.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  They said February 1st but it hasn't.
[11:02.000 --> 11:09.000]  I've got clips today where they say it's going to be compulsory soon.
[11:09.000 --> 11:11.000]  All of this is going on.
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.000]  And so we're hearing, oh, they're going to take the restrictions off.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  Oh, they're going to back off.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  But notice the CDC says, okay, you don't need to wear a mask
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  but the airlines still are going to do it.
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  Oh, and the public schools are still going to do it
[11:23.000 --> 11:25.000]  because they get federal funds to do it.
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  Oh, and the private corporations are going to try to demand it.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  And so just like they have sanctuary cities in the U.S.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  800 plus of them where illegal aliens can commit crimes.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  You name it, don't get in trouble.
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.000]  It's the same thing now where they're going to have
[11:37.000 --> 11:40.000]  a cult-like enforcement in the city still
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  and in the different countries they've conquered
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  like Germany, like Australia, like Australia, like New Zealand,
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  like Scotland.
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.000]  And it's all the same management, the same alumni
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  of the Bilderberg Group public-private partnership
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  with the U.N. and others.
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  And they're just there.
[12:01.000 --> 12:06.000]  And so they've already bitten off a large part of the elephant.
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  They're trying to digest that right now.
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  So they're going to give you a little bit of a rest
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  to make you think you've won so all these networks
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  and individuals that stood up and spoke out will kind of go away.
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  And so, yeah, they gained a million miles of tyranny on us.
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  But we push it back 700,000 miles.
[12:27.000 --> 12:35.000]  But they've still got 700 plus thousand miles on us.
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  So they take us a million and a half, two million,
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  three million miles into tyranny.
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  We push them back 50, 60, 70 percent.
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  We're still deep down in the pit.
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  So what's the answer?
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  Knowing the project, knowing how it works,
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  knowing their tactics, knowing they wrote white papers
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  on how they would squeeze us, then let off a little bit,
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.000]  then squeeze even tighter, then let off a little less,
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  and then finally just break your neck.
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  They're putting in the World ID.
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  They're putting in the tracking systems.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  They're putting in the casual society hell system
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  that once everything's digital,
[13:06.000 --> 13:09.000]  they can seize it or turn it off however they want,
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  and it's all going to be tied to your behavior
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  and how you submit to them.
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.000]  This is a nightmare hell that we are being inducted into.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  So when we come back from break,
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  I'm going to boil down the fact that we actually pushed them
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  back farther than they thought.
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  They knew we'd push them back some.
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  They knew we'd rise up.
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  They're actually totally freaked out.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  That just means they're going to pull a bunch
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  of other serious scams they've got in their arsenal,
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  and I've been studying what they're preparing.
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  We'll tell you about that coming up.
[13:40.000 --> 13:43.000]  But first, let's play a clip from COVID-1984.
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  It always says important things.
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  Mandates and restrictions are being lifted around the world,
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  but in a minute 38, he lays it out perfectly.
[13:52.000 --> 13:53.000]  Here it is.
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  Well, it is great to see mandates and restrictions
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  finally being rolled back in many places around the world.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  Are we supposed to be thanking the government officials
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  and the experts who initially imposed
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  these restrictions on us in the first place?
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.000]  Only then to allow us to have some of our freedoms back now.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  It's an honest question.
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.000]  So why now?
[14:13.000 --> 14:16.000]  Well, they say it's because the numbers are down
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  and we all did such a great job obeying the restrictions
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  and the mandates, and it proves that they work, right?
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  So in other words, don't be surprised if and when
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  they say it's time to reimpose them
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  in the not too distant future.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  The timing is also curious when you consider
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  that the nice weather is coming and people might be more inclined
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.000]  to attend a demonstration or a rally, perhaps.
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  There's also some key elections coming up that, you know,
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  maybe they want to relieve some of the pressure from the valve,
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  so to speak, as people have grown tired of COVID-1984
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  and those who impose it.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  While lifting the restrictions and the mandates can
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  and should be seen as a victory for freedom
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  and for the people, make no mistake,
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.000]  this was also a major victory for the technocrats
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  and the social engineers who have successfully turned
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  two weeks to flatten the curve into two years.
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  And now the groundwork has been laid.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  The infrastructure has been established
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  and in another generation or so,
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  this will become the new normal they promised us.
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.000]  That's right.
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.000]  If it hasn't already, unless we do something about it.
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.000]  So be wary of those who declare emergency after emergency
[15:27.000 --> 15:56.000]  only to offer the solution to you on a silver platter.
[15:57.000 --> 15:58.000]  Thank you.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  We've seen the voices of good people all around the world
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.000]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.000]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria,
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  their world's gonna end in 2030,
[16:39.000 --> 16:42.000]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  And none of it can succeed.
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  None of it can actually be carried out
[16:46.000 --> 16:49.000]  unless everybody is silenced and gaslit.
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.000]  And that's why truth comes with hard work
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  and with research and with diligence.
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  And it's hard to share in Full Wars links
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.000]  and band up video links.
[16:58.000 --> 17:01.000]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.000]  Something very rare is going on.
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.000]  And it ends in just three days
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  as of the time I'm taping this announcement
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  on Thursday afternoon.
[17:11.000 --> 17:15.000]  Coming up this Monday, the biggest sale in four years
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  of high quality, affordable foods
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.000]  and for Parallax.com will end.
[17:20.000 --> 17:23.000]  That's 25% off already the lowest prices

[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  at infowarstore.com.

[17:32.000 --> 17:37.000]  or infowarstore.com and it takes you to the same place.
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.000]  50% off as well of super high quality products
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.000]  like X3, the Deep Earth, Bristol Ionine.
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.000]  That sale is going on as well.
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  It doesn't end on Monday.
[17:49.000 --> 17:50.000]  It'll end in a few weeks
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  and we're almost sold out of the product.
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  Everybody needs to have horrible food to be prepared
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  to become self-sufficient now
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  with the best high quality food at the lowest prices

[18:03.000 --> 18:06.000]  new tropics with our latest brain force offering,

[18:07.000 --> 18:10.000]  Now it is easier than ever to take in the new liquid form
[18:10.000 --> 18:13.000]  with eight beneficial super ingredients.
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  Brain Force Ultra is the result of years of enhanced formulation.
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  Three of toxic additives each ingredient
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.000]  is specifically selected for its many key properties.
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  Some of the proprietary super ingredients
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.000]  behind Brain Force Ultra include
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  Goronaseed which is loaded with energy compounds
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  and antioxidants that have been used
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  by Amazonian tribes for centuries.
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  Alpha GPC, a natural compound found in the brain
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  that delivers an essential nutrient, Koli
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  and Ginkoli which is also known
[18:42.000 --> 18:45.000]  for its exceptional antioxidant content.
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  This product is more than twice the servings
[18:47.000 --> 18:49.000]  of our Brain Force Plus as well
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  so you know it's packed full of the good stuff.
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  Destroy that brain fog today
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  and secure your bottle of Brain Force Ultra
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  before it is completely sold out
[18:57.000 --> 19:00.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[19:01.000 --> 19:03.000]  Cover Commander here
[19:03.000 --> 19:06.000]  with an important message to humanity.
[19:06.000 --> 19:09.000]  I have decided that all of you
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.000]  will take a special injection
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  so that you will be safe.
[19:14.000 --> 19:17.000]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.000]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors
[19:22.000 --> 19:27.000]  for the next 15 days to flatten the cans.
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  I also need you to wear masks
[19:29.000 --> 19:32.000]  and I also need you to only shop
[19:32.000 --> 19:35.000]  at mega corporations.
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.000]  That way we can consolidate control
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  and bankrupt the world economy
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.000]  leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  You will then be my slaves.
[19:48.000 --> 19:51.000]  Oh, and then you'll get that special shot
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  of freedom from Cobra
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  who will remove your immune system
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  so you'll be dependent on me
[19:57.000 --> 20:11.000]  for the rest of your miserable lives.
[20:27.000 --> 20:39.000]  That's Mozart, a requiem for a dream.
[20:39.000 --> 20:44.000]  Bringing us in from the 1971 film
[20:44.000 --> 20:48.000]  A Clockwork Orange, directed by Stanley Kubrick.
[20:48.000 --> 20:51.000]  It'll be a lot more fun to watch the classic movies today
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  but we don't have time to do that.
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.000]  We are facing our real Clockwork Orange.
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  Here we are, my friends.
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  So let me just say it very simply.
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  I think as an audience you know this more than I do
[21:02.000 --> 21:03.000]  or as well as I do.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  So we need to get this out to the next group of people
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  and then get them to tell the next group
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  and tell them to tell the next group and so on.
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  Because it's effective to tell somebody
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  but you've got to explain, hey, you're on a mission.
[21:14.000 --> 21:17.000]  You've got to warn other people now.
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.000]  And that's how human power can override
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  the big corporations and the corrupt globalists
[21:22.000 --> 21:23.000]  of the censorship.
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  So it's not like I just said this.
[21:25.000 --> 21:29.000]  In fact, the Archivist does an incredible job.
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  Every time I ask for this on air within a few days I get it.
[21:31.000 --> 21:37.000]  I'd like to ask the Archivist to go back
[21:37.000 --> 21:41.000]  to February, March, April, May, June, July of 2020
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  where I even showed graphs and explained that they'll do lockdowns
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  and then partially take the restrictions off
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  with the mask and force injections
[21:48.000 --> 21:51.000]  and then bring them back and so on and so forth
[21:51.000 --> 21:57.000]  but areas like Australia and Germany where they get full control
[21:57.000 --> 22:02.000]  they will just press and press and press and press and never stop.
[22:02.000 --> 22:05.000]  But where you say no, they'll back off and then bring it back,
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  back off and bring it back trying to exhaust you.
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  But if you're aware that you've got to fight a bunch of battles
[22:09.000 --> 22:12.000]  to win the war, well, you're going to get geared up for war
[22:12.000 --> 22:17.000]  psychologically, information war, political, nonviolent,
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.000]  civil disobedience war, just the war for your mind
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  and you're going to enjoy it.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  You're not glad they're attacking, you're not glad it's happening
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  but you kind of get into it.
[22:26.000 --> 22:29.000]  I mean, they're not breaking me
[22:29.000 --> 22:32.000]  except I'm getting me so fired up I might have a heart attack.
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  I'm the opposite of about to break.
[22:35.000 --> 22:38.000]  I'm about to strangle these people but I know that's what they want
[22:38.000 --> 22:41.000]  so I'm going to do it politically, I'm going to do it with information.
[22:41.000 --> 22:44.000]  I'm going to hurt them because they deserve to be hurt
[22:44.000 --> 22:45.000]  because they're bad people.
[22:45.000 --> 22:49.000]  They want Joe Rogan to apologize claiming he put out this info when he didn't.
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  They said, well, get off your back when you apologize.
[22:51.000 --> 22:54.000]  I told him, I said, you apologize, it'll get ten times worse.
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  So he came out a few days ago and said, I'm not going to apologize.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  This is a bunch of BS.
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  Bunch of nonsense.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  I apologize to some people, I might have hurt their feelings
[23:03.000 --> 23:06.000]  but I don't apologize to the corporations and the corrupt groups
[23:06.000 --> 23:07.000]  that just want to silence me.
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  They don't care about people.
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  They care about shutting us up.
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  So just as night follows day and day follows night,
[23:18.000 --> 23:23.000]  the globalists are not going to stop this.
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  The people they've got under their control,
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.000]  they're going to continue to turn the screws on
[23:27.000 --> 23:29.000]  because they want full dominance.
[23:29.000 --> 23:30.000]  They want to suck them dry.
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  These are predators.
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  I wanted to play a clip out of New York
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  because this is still going on everywhere around the world
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  where the globalists are in control
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  and they have no intention of it ending.
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  So people say, oh, I don't care about New York.
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  I don't care about L.A. screw them.
[23:44.000 --> 23:45.000]  I'll just move out of there.
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  Well, after they've captured the coast,
[23:47.000 --> 23:48.000]  they'll move against us.
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  So we better have empathy for Canada
[23:50.000 --> 23:51.000]  and empathy for New York.
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  Might as well be North Korea
[23:53.000 --> 23:57.000]  and for Germany and Austria and Australia
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.000]  because the same New World Order corporations
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  are taking over our countries and our towns
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  and our cities and our families
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  are the ones that have got them.
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.000]  So here's what's happening yesterday in New York
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.000]  where the police come in just like in Canada
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  in a Catholic church
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  or in a Protestant church in Canada
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  or in a Catholic church in Australia
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  and say, oh, he's not wearing a mask
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  and they go arrest him.
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.000]  A cult wanting to see your submission,
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  like women having to wear a mask in Saudi Arabia
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  as a symbol of their submission.
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  And anybody that's got a mask on
[24:32.000 --> 24:33.000]  is now second-class citizens.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  All the elites don't have to wear their mask.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  Here's the clip.
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  Talk about the Chinese New Year.
[24:38.000 --> 24:39.000]  I like it.
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  Oh, they found him.
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  I like it.
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  They found him.
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  Look at this.
[24:49.000 --> 24:50.000]  Look at this.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  What are you doing?
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  What the f*** are you doing?
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  What are you doing?
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  What are you doing?
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  What are you doing?
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  Holy crap.
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  Holy crap.
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  That's assault.
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  That is assault.
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  Oh my God.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  This goes on for a while.
[25:12.000 --> 25:15.000]  He's slamming down the full things on him, FullWars.com.
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.000]  But here's the father out in occupied California
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  who has his special needs daughter
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  that can't even talk now that she wears this mask
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  and is having oxygen deprivation
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  talking about that he'll never put up with this again
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  and he's so ashamed that he's submitted to this evil.
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  And this is happening everywhere.
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  We've got a clip coming up after that
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  where we have the documents where just like the schools,
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  the more people injected, the higher the money as they get,
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  it's tied to federal funding.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  The same thing with wearing these damn masks.
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  Behavioral psychologist at the Rockefeller Foundation
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  when Bill Gates came up with this crap.
[25:47.000 --> 25:48.000]  Here's the clip.
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.000]  I am here for my daughter and beyond anything else.
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  She loves school.
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.000]  The harm you have done to her, she still loves school.
[25:57.000 --> 26:00.000]  She loves her teachers, her therapists, her helpers,
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  above all her principal at Scott School.
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  Her team goes above and beyond for her.
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.000]  Her LBS has gone to the moon and back for her.
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  She's a happy and outgoing girl
[26:09.000 --> 26:11.000]  with countless positive and influential people
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  that have helped her along the way.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  Her team and her principal at Scott School
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  have been such great role models to her.
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  Her dream is to work there someday.
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  She talks nothing else than wanting to be a teacher
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  or wanting to go to school and be in work at school.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  I can only name a few people in her life
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  that have harmed her and actively participated
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  in holding her back and stopping her progress
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  and almost every one of them is in this room tonight.
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  The past two years have been shameful
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  and the project has been busy lauding themselves
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  while they enact policies that have absolutely
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  been devastating to her growth.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  We have seen two years of almost no growth.
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  Miss Goals.
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  Goals removed.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  Her team is doing everything that they can.
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  We've hired specialists.
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  She still loves school.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  My 10-year-old daughter has kept these feelings to herself
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.000]  about how much she desperately wants to take her mask off.
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  When we told her that it may be possible on Monday,
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  she cried, tears.
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  She jumped up and down.
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  She told us that she was so excited
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.000]  that people may finally be able to understand her.
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  You have harmed her so much with this.
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  Everybody talks about everybody's got to be safe.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  Everybody's got to have everything
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  and we've left so many children behind.
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  We've tried to protect her.
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.000]  This morning she got up before us
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  and she started singing a song to her dolls
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  about how excited she was
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.000]  that kids were finally going to be able to see her smile,
[27:39.000 --> 27:42.000]  that she was going to be able to see other kids' smiles,
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  that kids would be able to understand her
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  and she would stop being picked on
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  because they could not understand her through her mask
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  because her speech has been delayed
[27:51.000 --> 27:54.000]  even more than her special needs.
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.000]  She is a strong girl.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  But when I heard her do that
[27:59.000 --> 28:02.000]  and I heard the things that she said,
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  it broke me.
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.000]  I will never forgive myself for not fighting more.
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.000]  I feel that I have failed her for not fighting more.
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  When we archive this band,
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  I think we'll put the rest of the clip on.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  We're going up against the break, but I got to say this.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  If you're a radio listener, you're lucky
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  because you're not a TV viewer.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  They're all wearing damn masks including him
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  and they're all nodding and agreeing.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  They should all take their mask off
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.000]  and say we want these people arrested that followed this.
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.000]  America wasn't built on all this cooking and crap.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  These people started a war with us.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  They're a bunch of behavioral psychologists.
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  They're eugenicist pedophiles.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  Eugenics pedophiles.
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  Eugenics pedophiles.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  And now they're starting nuclear war with Russia.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  These people have got to be removed.
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.000]  You know how mentally ill these psychotic behavioral psychologists are?
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.000]  And almost every damn one of them is a pedophile.
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.000]  He'll be right back. Stay with us.
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.000]  Sold out for months.
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  X3 is now back in stock.
[29:01.000 --> 29:04.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing,
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  our products are game changing,
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.000]  and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  It's not the soil anymore.
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  Most of the ocean is contaminated,
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.000]  but when you get high quality tri-iodine,
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  all three of the healthy types together,
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.000]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido,
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  but most importantly, your immune system.
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  So, X3.
[29:25.000 --> 29:28.000]  The only tri-iodine on the market,
[29:28.000 --> 29:31.000]  highest grade, is now exclusively available again
[29:31.000 --> 29:34.000]  at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine,
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  and what it does for your body,
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  it takes about two weeks to get it on average,
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  you really need to experience X3.
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it,
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  I know you're going to be reordering it,
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  but particularly those that haven't ever tried the product,
[29:49.000 --> 29:52.000]  you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body.
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen,
[29:54.000 --> 29:56.000]  and it funds the info war, a true 360 win.
[29:56.000 --> 30:00.000]  So again, X3, back at stock, 50% off at limited time.
[30:00.000 --> 30:03.000]  With all the craziness going on in the world,
[30:03.000 --> 30:06.000]  with the globalists plotting their next big lockdown,
[30:06.000 --> 30:10.000]  with the next phase of the Great Reset being a stage-cyber attack,
[30:10.000 --> 30:13.000]  with the deep state pushing a civil war,
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  not just here, but in Europe,
[30:15.000 --> 30:18.000]  and war with Russia, with the massive inflation
[30:18.000 --> 30:21.000]  and all the other garbage that's taking place
[30:21.000 --> 30:25.000]  like supply chain rate nouns, you need to get prepared now
[30:25.000 --> 30:29.000]  with high-quality, storable food that is ready to ship.

[30:58.000 --> 31:00.000]  that wants to be self-sufficient.
[31:00.000 --> 31:03.000]  With all the craziness going on in the world,
[31:03.000 --> 31:06.000]  with the globalists plotting their next big lockdown,
[31:06.000 --> 31:10.000]  with the next phase of the Great Reset being a stage-cyber attack,
[31:10.000 --> 31:13.000]  with the deep state pushing a civil war,

[31:18.000 --> 31:20.000]  and all the other garbage that's taking place

[31:55.000 --> 31:57.000]  This is absolutely essential for everybody
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  that wants to be self-sufficient.
[32:02.000 --> 32:04.000]  This is a great sponsor.
[32:04.000 --> 32:06.000]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there
[32:06.000 --> 32:09.000]  on a high-quality, high-rated satellite phone.
[32:09.000 --> 32:11.000]  You can't be tracked, you can't be traced,
[32:11.000 --> 32:14.000]  and it'll work anywhere in the world where you can see the sky.
[32:14.000 --> 32:16.000]  You can also buy cheap antennas and things for your car
[32:16.000 --> 32:18.000]  in your house that also are on the site.
[32:18.000 --> 32:21.000]  Infowarsphone.com, that's just a site that takes you to these folks.
[32:21.000 --> 32:24.000]  They supply the board for all everybody with their systems as well.
[32:24.000 --> 32:26.000]  They're amazing folks, and you get a free phone,
[32:26.000 --> 32:32.000]  a $650 value, absolutely free at Infowarsphone.com.
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[32:34.000 --> 32:37.000]  These aren't, and the calls are free when folks call you.
[32:37.000 --> 32:42.000]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes.
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.000]  So the calls, they were free, it was like a regular cell phone.
[32:44.000 --> 32:47.000]  You're not being tracked or traced, and I keep one in my car.
[32:47.000 --> 32:49.000]  I've given them to my parents as gifts way out in the middle of nowhere
[32:49.000 --> 32:51.000]  where regular phones don't work, they work.
[32:51.000 --> 33:08.000]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[33:22.000 --> 33:26.000]  So my old buddy Joe Rogan sent me a text last night.
[33:26.000 --> 33:30.000]  Charlie Kurt was on Fox News talking about major insurance companies
[33:30.000 --> 33:34.000]  saying they've seen a 40% death increase in the US.
[33:34.000 --> 33:35.000]  He says, is that true?
[33:35.000 --> 33:36.000]  So I just search into it.
[33:36.000 --> 33:38.000]  Yeah, go ahead and bring me the headline, thanks.
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.000]  I went ahead and search into it and pulled up a whole bunch of mainstream news
[33:42.000 --> 33:45.000]  admitting it weeks after we reported it.
[33:45.000 --> 33:48.000]  Huge, huge numbers, insurance group.
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  Not just this one that manages $100 billion.
[33:51.000 --> 33:55.000]  She's death rate up 40% over pre-pandemic levels.
[33:55.000 --> 34:02.000]  And it's up massively last year over the year before once the vaccine kicked in.
[34:02.000 --> 34:09.000]  So ladies and gentlemen, that's out of the hill newspaper for you right there.
[34:09.000 --> 34:10.000]  So yeah, that's going on.
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.000]  I'm going to play that Charlie Kurt Club coming up next segment.
[34:13.000 --> 34:16.000]  But let me just hone in on something.
[34:16.000 --> 34:22.000]  I'd known Rand Paul and I'm proud to know him since 1996 when his father ran for Congress
[34:22.000 --> 34:23.000]  for the second time.
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  He got in for one term in the 80s under Reagan.
[34:27.000 --> 34:33.000]  Got mad at Reagan for doing a bunch of spending, attacked Reagan and lost his seat
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  because he was being a purist, which I agree with.
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  Dr. No, he was called.
[34:37.000 --> 34:42.000]  He got back in 96 and you know the rest of his history, served for more than 20 plus years,
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  did a great job.
[34:44.000 --> 34:50.000]  So I mean, I know Rand well knowing personally and know his dad personally and know the family.
[34:50.000 --> 34:51.000]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[34:51.000 --> 34:54.000]  They're fellow Texans.
[34:54.000 --> 34:59.000]  But the issue here is that I know Rand Paul is as smart as I am or smarter.
[34:59.000 --> 35:03.000]  I mean, he's extremely smart and he knows that this isn't a vaccine.
[35:03.000 --> 35:06.000]  He knows this isn't working.
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  And he might have believed that maybe it was going to work early on.
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  But once he saw the numbers, he needs to come out against it.
[35:11.000 --> 35:18.000]  And I said a few months ago, if he doesn't come out against this for children, at least,
[35:18.000 --> 35:24.000]  I'm declaring war on him because I was going to declare war on Trump and was planning whole
[35:24.000 --> 35:25.000]  campaigns against him.
[35:25.000 --> 35:29.000]  I was going to go to Mar-a-Lago and bullhorn him for a week just because I like Trump.
[35:29.000 --> 35:32.000]  I want Trump to stop this killing of the kids.
[35:32.000 --> 35:33.000]  Okay, he got conned.
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  He went along with it.
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  Now we know it doesn't work.
[35:37.000 --> 35:38.000]  It doesn't protect you.
[35:38.000 --> 35:44.000]  It gives you cancer, heart attacks, blood clots, heart swelling, menstrual problems.
[35:44.000 --> 35:49.000]  But I started thinking, why am I so pissed at Trump when Rand Paul's a doctor that got
[35:49.000 --> 35:50.000]  him to do it?
[35:50.000 --> 35:53.000]  He was part of convincing him.
[35:53.000 --> 35:54.000]  And I get what Trump wanted to do.
[35:54.000 --> 35:55.000]  They were going to lock things down.
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  He said, hey, let's just have this shot.
[35:57.000 --> 36:00.000]  Let's fix it because old inoculations worked because they were really inoculations.
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.000]  They might have side effects, but this is even an inoculation.
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  It's not a side effect to make you sick.
[36:05.000 --> 36:09.000]  It's on purpose so that you don't go to work so people refuse to go to work and haven't
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  taken it to break down society.
[36:11.000 --> 36:16.000]  So I don't tell you this whole Rand Paul story for no reason.
[36:16.000 --> 36:22.000]  I'm saying I went after Paul, as you know, in probably 15 broadcasts in a friendly way,
[36:22.000 --> 36:29.000]  but a very serious way because I'm not selling out my morals just to defend a Republican
[36:29.000 --> 36:30.000]  party.
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  All I get is pain for supporting these guys.
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  But as long as they do good things, I love the pain.
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.000]  But I'm not going to sit there while they sell us out.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  I'm going to give them pain.
[36:39.000 --> 36:40.000]  And by the way, Rand Paul is great.
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  They shot at him, broke his ribs, attacked him everywhere.
[36:43.000 --> 36:49.000]  He's the real deal because they know his potential.
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  So Paul now has come out against the injections for under 16.
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  He's come out and said, really, it doesn't work anymore.
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  He's kind of walked it back good.
[36:57.000 --> 36:58.000]  That's enough.
[36:58.000 --> 36:59.000]  That's all we want.
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  That makes my conscience feel good and it saves a lot of people because we can't, you
[37:03.000 --> 37:06.000]  know, sit there and keep going along with this.
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.000]  And yes, he's coming out saying this is a fraud.
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  Fauci needs to be criminally investigated.
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.000]  All this stuff needs to go on.
[37:14.000 --> 37:15.000]  That's wonderful.
[37:15.000 --> 37:20.000]  So Paul's going from being a great guy to back to the hero of always seen him as Senator
[37:20.000 --> 37:21.000]  Paul.
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  Then in comes all the new stuff.
[37:23.000 --> 37:28.000]  And that's him saying, Rand Paul, Dems have overplayed their hand with stupid theater
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  COVID madness, but it's not stupid.
[37:30.000 --> 37:35.000]  They made $90 billion over at Pfizer, tens of billions of the other companies with Bill
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  Gates invested in both.
[37:37.000 --> 37:41.000]  They're getting world IDs put in half of Europe's under martial law.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  Forced injections have begun.
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  Australia and New Zealand are under martial law.
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  Trudeau's trying to keep Canada under martial law.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  And we don't want them to just back off now.
[37:50.000 --> 37:51.000]  We all go back to sleep.
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  Then they're going to come right back.
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.000]  We want criminal investigations like he's announced in the Senate and the house that's
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  done by Steve Scaliso also got shot.
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  You know, at the same time, Paul got shot at.
[38:02.000 --> 38:03.000]  So these are great men.
[38:03.000 --> 38:07.000]  And we need to go on the offense, not just say, oh, it's stupid.
[38:07.000 --> 38:08.000]  Oh, they're dumb.
[38:08.000 --> 38:09.000]  Oh, they're idiots.
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  Oh, we don't know why they're so stupid.
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.000]  They're not stupid.
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  It's a premeditated, great reset, new world order, transhumanist takeover.
[38:16.000 --> 38:17.000]  Address it for what it is.
[38:17.000 --> 38:18.000]  Rise up politically.
[38:18.000 --> 38:23.000]  Let's defeat this agenda instead of fighting the salvos it launches at us.
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  Let's defeat the evil empire of the Bilderberg group and the Davos group.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  Here's Senator Paul.
[38:28.000 --> 38:32.000]  It's bringing in Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul, who is also an MD senator.
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.000]  Good to have you with us.
[38:33.000 --> 38:38.000]  What's your read on what's happening in Canada and another convoy that's being organized
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  in the United States?
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.000]  What is this say to you about what's going on and what does it reflect for you?
[38:43.000 --> 38:46.000]  You know, I think it's no longer a right-left issue.
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.000]  There may have been more of us on the right, not liking the government mandates.
[38:49.000 --> 38:54.000]  But I think now you're finding parents of children, whether they're left of center,
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  in the center, independents who really don't like the idea of just forcing children to
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  wear masks when the science don't.
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.000]  It doesn't really indicate that the masks are working.
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  Even the CDC admits the cloth masks aren't working.
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  You see kids outside huddled in the cold, eating their sandwiches.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  You see kids playing outside of masks.
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  So I think it is bringing right and left together.
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.000]  I don't think it's going to, I think in the end, the Democrats have really overplayed
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.000]  their hands on the mandates because they're going to lose their populace.
[39:21.000 --> 39:22.000]  They're going to use their public.
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  So I think this is a turning point.
[39:24.000 --> 39:28.000]  I think it's really getting to the point where the science is clear that the bulk
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.000]  and the vast majority of the masks that people are wearing have no difference,
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  make no difference in the trajectory of the virus.
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.000]  So yeah, I think ultimately the Democrats are going to lose the public.
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.000]  And if they haven't already lost the public, I think they're getting there.
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  Could be.
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.000]  This photo of Stacey Abrams got a lot of attention over the weekend.
[39:46.000 --> 39:51.000]  Not only was she not wearing a mask, but she was also in front of a group of children.
[39:51.000 --> 39:54.000]  And you look at these little kids, I think we've all become maybe too used to seeing
[39:54.000 --> 39:57.000]  children with half of their faces covered.
[39:57.000 --> 40:02.000]  And she put out a statement saying it's shameful that our opponents are using Black History Month
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.000]  reading event for Georgia children as an impetus for a false political attack.
[40:07.000 --> 40:14.000]  This pathetic, transparent and silly attack is beneath anyone who claims he wants to lead Georgia.
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.000]  Much to do about nothing or is this significant?
[40:17.000 --> 40:20.000]  I think if she were honest, she would admit that it's theater.
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.000]  Almost all the politicians I see around the Capitol are quickly putting them on for cameras.
[40:25.000 --> 40:26.000]  And it really is theater.
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.000]  They know it.
[40:27.000 --> 40:28.000]  I see them in private sitting down.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  They don't have their masks on.
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  I interviewed one of the nominees to head an agency for government.
[40:33.000 --> 40:36.000]  We sat and talked for 45 minutes in my office.
[40:36.000 --> 40:37.000]  And then they said they wanted a picture.
[40:37.000 --> 40:38.000]  And I said, well, sure.
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  He says, you mind if I put my mask on?
[40:40.000 --> 40:43.000]  And I said, hey, whatever, close your boat, you know.
[40:43.000 --> 40:46.000]  But I mean, it is, it is all theater at this point.
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  And if it were just adults being stupid, that would be fine.
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  You have a right to be stupid in a free country,
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  but you don't have a right to force this on children.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  And it is really, really sad.
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.000]  And somebody's got to stand up, whether it's putting your semi in the middle of a town
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.000]  and honking the horn or whatever, or whether it's parents going to a school board meeting.
[41:03.000 --> 41:08.000]  These people will never let go of our freedoms or our children if we do not push back.
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  It's interesting.
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  There was a study that was done or released.
[41:11.000 --> 41:16.000]  I saw a graph that showed California versus Texas in terms of the cases.
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.000]  And California, of course, has much more onerous masking rules.
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.000]  Texas much more open in terms of choice to mask or not.
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  And essentially, California's cases were slightly higher.
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  The trend line is very similar.
[41:30.000 --> 41:39.000]  But there's no way to read this chart other than to think that the California is not at an advantage for masking up.
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  Well, this is true over and over again.
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.000]  If you look at most state mandates when they were instituted and you look at the incidence of the disease,
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  the incidence of the disease continues to rise after the mandates.
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.000]  In Florida, about half of the counties obeyed the order to quit the mandates
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  when DeSantis said quit doing the mandates.
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  The other half kept the mandates.
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  And these were large numbers of children.
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  The incidence between the two groups is essentially the same.
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  The masks do not work.
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  We are just punishing our children.
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  And as someone who doesn't hear very well, I know what it's like to not be able to understand people
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.000]  because you can't see their lips.
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  And so I think this is terrible.
[42:13.000 --> 42:18.000]  Plus kids, even kids who have normal hearing are learning by looking at the lips and the facial expressions.
[42:18.000 --> 42:23.000]  This is how they learn to be part of a group and be part of a community.
[42:23.000 --> 42:27.000]  So I think it's really sad for these kids and somebody's got to stand up for it.
[42:27.000 --> 42:28.000]  Heartbreaking.
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.000]  And they're so compliant and obedient and they're doing what they're told.
[42:31.000 --> 42:34.000]  And they think that this is a way of life.
[42:34.000 --> 42:38.000]  And I just wonder how long it's going to take to free them up to live in a world
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.000]  where they don't have to cover half their faces, especially with cloth masks,
[42:41.000 --> 42:44.000]  which as you say, the CDC say, really didn't do anything.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  Thank you very much, Senator Paul.
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.000]  Thank you.
[42:47.000 --> 43:09.000]  We'll talk to you, sir.
[43:17.000 --> 43:20.000]  The population, great reset, combine.
[43:20.000 --> 43:26.000]  Trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision.
[43:26.000 --> 43:33.000]  Suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[43:33.000 --> 43:39.000]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's gonna end in 2030,
[43:39.000 --> 43:42.000]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[43:42.000 --> 43:49.000]  And none of it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.000]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[43:53.000 --> 43:57.000]  And that's why it's hard to share info wars links and band up video links.
[43:57.000 --> 44:13.000]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[44:28.000 --> 44:30.000]  We need to be able to keep up the pace.
[44:30.000 --> 44:38.000]  Our natural mixture harnesses the power of 10 known ingredients to let your body relax and get the sleep you need.
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  Wake up refreshed and take on the day.
[44:40.000 --> 44:48.000]  Info Wars Life wants to bring you a sleep support formula that goes above and beyond other leading brands at an affordable price.
[44:48.000 --> 44:52.000]  Get the sleep you deserve and experience the power of knockout.
[44:52.000 --> 44:56.000]  Head on over to infowarslife.com and say goodbye to fatigue.
[44:56.000 --> 44:59.000]  That's infowarslife.com.
[45:26.000 --> 45:36.000]  This is a criminal takeover.
[45:36.000 --> 45:44.000]  And when you look at the new superclass, it's the politicians, it's the corporate media, it's the police, it's the bureaucrats,
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  it's members of Congress and their staff and their families, it's the White House.
[45:48.000 --> 45:57.000]  Now it's postal workers who were all exempt from the poison shots but not the general public and everybody else through corporate rule.
[45:57.000 --> 46:00.000]  So this is the true discrimination that's going on.
[46:00.000 --> 46:11.000]  Something very rare is going on and it ends in just three days as of the time I'm taping this announcement on Thursday afternoon.
[46:11.000 --> 46:20.000]  Coming up this Monday, the biggest sale in four years of high quality, affordable foods at prepareallocs.com will end.
[46:20.000 --> 46:28.000]  That's 25% off already the lowest prices you're going to find on high quality, affordable food at infowarscored.com.
[46:28.000 --> 46:37.000]  Again, you can go to preparewithallocs.com or infowarscored.com and it takes you to the same place.
[46:37.000 --> 46:45.000]  50% off as well on super high quality products like X3, The Deep Earth, Crystal iodine.
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  That sale is going on as well.
[46:47.000 --> 46:52.000]  It doesn't end on Monday, it'll end in a few weeks and we're almost sold out of the product.
[46:52.000 --> 46:56.000]  Everybody needs to have horrible food to be prepared to become self-sufficient now.
[46:56.000 --> 47:00.000]  The best high quality food at the lowest prices at infowarscored.com.
[47:00.000 --> 47:07.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:30.000 --> 47:35.000]  I didn't even know you came to me in too much importance.
[47:35.000 --> 47:39.000]  I ain't no black actress, I ain't no doctor with greaves.
[47:39.000 --> 47:47.000]  Freedom folks! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
[47:47.000 --> 47:57.000]  Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  Oh, there it is.
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  There ain't freedom, there's nothing.
[48:01.000 --> 48:07.000]  Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back and I mentioned this.
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.000]  I'm not name dropping it, it's just those out of the way Joe Rogan has sent me a link last time.
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.000]  It's not real. I sent him back a bunch of articles, The Hill, Zero Head, Jim Fullwarscored.
[48:19.000 --> 48:22.000]  But the insurance company guy went on and made screen TV.
[48:22.000 --> 48:28.000]  He manages a $100 billion company and it turns out a whole big group of insurance companies are finding similar numbers
[48:28.000 --> 48:33.000]  also in Europe, also in Australia, all over the place, everywhere you get the shots.
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  And the numbers weren't there in 2020.
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  It was a little bit of extra death, but not much.
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.000]  But when the shots start, in 2021, it explodes.
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.000]  That is absolutely insane. Here's Charlie Kirk talking about it.
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  Charlie Kirk, thanks so much for coming on.
[48:48.000 --> 48:49.000]  What is this?
[48:49.000 --> 48:50.000]  Thank you.
[48:50.000 --> 48:55.000]  We don't know. I mean, one business that actually tells the truth regarding the death of Americans is life insurance.
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  They have to get this right.
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  They have entire teams of actuaries that study this data all day long.
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  It's not the public health authorities that are warning this.
[49:02.000 --> 49:06.000]  It's a single CEO of a major life insurance company that says,
[49:06.000 --> 49:12.000]  hey, by the way, there's kind of a 40% increase in death, 10%, he said, would be a once in 200 year catastrophe.
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.000]  We have a 40% increase in death and it's not because of COVID.
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  And we deserve answers.
[49:18.000 --> 49:23.000]  And what's so amazing, Tucker, is that we've known this information and this data for a couple weeks now.
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  Where are the politicians? Where are the leaders?
[49:25.000 --> 49:30.000]  Where are the people we put in charge to actually care about the well-being of our people?
[49:30.000 --> 49:35.000]  Well, at least we know how many times Joe Rogan used a bad word in a podcast the last 10 years.
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  I guess we're getting our pronouns right for our six year olds,
[49:37.000 --> 49:44.000]  but we have a 40% increase in death amongst the supposed healthiest portion of the American population.
[49:44.000 --> 49:48.000]  This is a catastrophe. We deserve answers and somewhat conjecture.
[49:48.000 --> 49:53.000]  Hey, does this have something to do with the fact that we might have done a mass inoculation strategy?
[49:53.000 --> 49:58.000]  We know that there was deaths of alienation, suicide and otherwise, but there's no answers.
[49:58.000 --> 49:59.000]  No one's talking about it.
[49:59.000 --> 50:06.000]  So, I mean, isn't this the primary number they should be focused on if you're in charge of the well-being of the American people
[50:06.000 --> 50:13.000]  and the death rate jumps by 40% in a cohort that's not supposed to die young?
[50:13.000 --> 50:17.000]  Then, like, why aren't you hair on fire upset about it?
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  I'm honestly confused.
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.000]  Well, it's either they don't care or they don't know how to talk about it
[50:23.000 --> 50:29.000]  or they are too concerned about GDP numbers or stock market increases or immigration quotas or whatever.
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  It's a mass casualty event. It's that simple.
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.000]  And the fact that the insurance companies are now warning us about it
[50:35.000 --> 50:38.000]  should have every politician, every political party across the country say,
[50:38.000 --> 50:41.000]  regardless of your politics, we got to figure out what's going on here.
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.000]  The lockdowns contributed and there's other things that definitely contributed as well.
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  This is probably the most important metric for our leaders to care about.
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  Well, that's exactly right.
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  And they don't care. And I just really am grateful that you noticed this
[50:54.000 --> 50:57.000]  or run over my head and brought it to us tonight.
[50:57.000 --> 50:58.000]  Charlie Kirk, thank you.
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.000]  Thank you.
[50:59.000 --> 51:03.000]  Yeah, Charlie Kirk is really now that everybody's waking up
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  and I guess he feels safe to tell the truth.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  He's more articulate than I am in most of the time.
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.000]  And he sounds like Alex Jones 2.0. That's really great news.
[51:10.000 --> 51:14.000]  Yeah, Pfizer quietly adds language, this is two days ago,
[51:14.000 --> 51:20.000]  a warning that unfavorable preclinical, clinical or safety data is coming out
[51:20.000 --> 51:25.000]  that's going to kill their stock and the stock is plunging two days after they put that out.
[51:25.000 --> 51:29.000]  Oh, and they lied about the numbers of Americans that took the shot
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  or any of these poison, so-called vaccines.
[51:31.000 --> 51:35.000]  It's more like 50%, like we told you, as we had sources inside.
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  It's not 70, 80%, like Biden said.
[51:37.000 --> 51:40.000]  By the way, it's the same thing for Europe and other places.
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  Oh, it's the same thing for Israel too.
[51:42.000 --> 51:45.000]  65%, I mean, they did submit more than we did.
[51:45.000 --> 51:49.000]  Oh, and notice they have the highest rate of deaths over there.
[51:49.000 --> 51:52.000]  And they're onto their fourth and fifth shots now.
[51:52.000 --> 51:56.000]  So this is a big, big, big, big deal.
[51:56.000 --> 52:03.000]  Let's hear from Scott Davidson, the actual head of the large insurance conglomerate.
[52:03.000 --> 52:04.000]  Here it is.
[52:04.000 --> 52:10.000]  One of our businesses is that we offer group life and disability insurance to employers.
[52:10.000 --> 52:14.000]  And we are seeing right now the highest death rates we have ever seen
[52:14.000 --> 52:17.000]  in the history of this business, not just in one America.
[52:17.000 --> 52:22.000]  The data is consistent across every player in that business.
[52:22.000 --> 52:29.000]  Now, this is primarily working-age people, 18 to 64, that are employers
[52:29.000 --> 52:32.000]  like all the employers on the screen here.
[52:32.000 --> 52:36.000]  And what we saw just in third quarter, we're seeing a continuing to fourth quarter,
[52:36.000 --> 52:42.000]  is that death rates are up 40% over what they were pre-pandemic.
[52:42.000 --> 52:48.000]  Now, just to give you an idea of how bad that is, a three-sigma
[52:48.000 --> 52:56.000]  or a one in 200-year catastrophe would be 10% increase over pre-pandemic.
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.000]  Hit pause.
[52:57.000 --> 53:02.000]  I looked the numbers up when this came out a month ago and we harped on it.
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.000]  World War II didn't cause this number.
[53:05.000 --> 53:13.000]  World War I killed three or four times more U.S. groups, didn't have that number.
[53:13.000 --> 53:14.000]  Didn't have that number.
[53:14.000 --> 53:19.000]  You understand, this is massive in young people.
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.000]  And it's not COVID.
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  That's why they don't want you to know.
[53:22.000 --> 53:23.000]  I mean, they hit us, folks.
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.000]  We try to get out of the new world order and they release the virus
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  and then hit us with a shot five times, six times worse than the virus.
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  On average, I have a top scientist on.
[53:32.000 --> 53:36.000]  The amount of spike protein it creates in you is five to six times.
[53:36.000 --> 53:40.000]  Well, if you average all of them together with the actuaries,
[53:40.000 --> 53:47.000]  Moderna, it's eight to nine times worse.
[53:47.000 --> 53:53.000]  Oh, and the discoverer of HIV who just died, he just died yesterday.
[53:53.000 --> 53:57.000]  He came out last year, a year and a half ago actually in 2020 and said,
[53:57.000 --> 54:02.000]  this is going to cause autoimmune disorder to explode, they're going to say it's HIV,
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  because it is HIV.
[54:04.000 --> 54:08.000]  And baby, it's now HIV off the chart.
[54:08.000 --> 54:12.000]  I mean, we are being murdered right now.
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.000]  There's a really powerful article by Gateway Pundit on today.
[54:15.000 --> 54:16.000]  Here's the list.
[54:16.000 --> 54:25.000]  1,000 different studies show extensive evidence of COVID-19 vaccine adverse events.
[54:25.000 --> 54:28.000]  Let's finish up with the CEO of One America.
[54:28.000 --> 54:35.000]  And again, it's a consortium that owns close to 50-something insurance companies,
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  Indiana Live, you know, all that stuff.
[54:37.000 --> 54:38.000]  Here it is.
[54:38.000 --> 54:45.000]  In 200-year catastrophe would be 10% increase over pre-pandemic.
[54:45.000 --> 54:49.000]  So 40% is just unheard of.
[54:49.000 --> 54:55.000]  And what the data is showing us is that the deaths that are being reported as COVID deaths
[54:55.000 --> 55:02.000]  greatly understate the actual death losses among working-age people from the pandemic.
[55:02.000 --> 55:09.000]  It may not all be COVID on their death certificate, but deaths are just a huge, huge numbers.
[55:09.000 --> 55:13.000]  We're also seeing an uptick in disability claims.
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  At first it was short-term disability claims, and now we're seeing...
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  So let's stop right there.
[55:18.000 --> 55:22.000]  There was a worldwide move against the globalist, kicking the globalist out with populist,
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  and they hit us with a bio-weapon.
[55:24.000 --> 55:29.000]  And then when you take the shot to supposedly protect yourself,
[55:29.000 --> 55:35.000]  well, you now are growing a deadly spike protein in your body.
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  So the sick joke is, it's taking your body over.
[55:37.000 --> 55:42.000]  So yeah, you're not going to catch COVID for five, six months until the spike protein goes back down.
[55:42.000 --> 55:46.000]  But during that period, it's running around eating holes in you.
[55:46.000 --> 55:49.000]  It's kind of like you cut one leg off, you're bleeding to death,
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.000]  and instead of putting a tourniquet around it, you cut the other one off,
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.000]  because it'll actually make the other leg not bleed as much,
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  but it doesn't matter, you just cut the other leg off.
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  Does that make sense?
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  This was so sickly and evil-y thought up.
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  I'm going to go to break and come back.
[56:04.000 --> 56:10.000]  We've got the dictator of Canada's brother joining us, his biological brother.
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.000]  It's going to be a huge interview next hour and so much more today.
[56:13.000 --> 56:19.000]  Just remember, listeners, we can't be tipped in the spear and tell you about this stuff four or five weeks ago,
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  and then now you see it on Tucker, then you'll see it everywhere,
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.000]  and then you'll see the CEOs of these companies probably arrested at the end of the day, like Pfizer.
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.000]  I mean, it's going that way. We are winning right now.
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  We are winning right now, but it's very close.
[56:30.000 --> 56:33.000]  So I need your support, and I got stuff you need.
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  You know, I told them a week ago, get rid of the sale because it's going to sell out,
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  but they didn't get rid of the multivitamin sale.
[56:38.000 --> 56:39.000]  I'm not mad at the crew.
[56:39.000 --> 56:43.000]  They didn't get rid of the vitamin C zinc rosehip super pill.
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  It's super strong.
[56:45.000 --> 56:48.000]  Linus falling level, 1,100% of organic vitamin C and more.
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  So that's also 40% off.
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  It means it's going to sell out by next week.
[56:52.000 --> 56:55.000]  I was going to keep it a few months till more came in, but we're just going to sell out of that.
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.000]  We need the funds.
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  X3 is back in stock.
[56:58.000 --> 56:59.000]  It is 50% off.
[56:59.000 --> 57:00.000]  It's so incredible.
[57:00.000 --> 57:03.000]  If you're not taking true iodine, you're just crazy, and it's back in stock now.
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.000]  Nobody else has got something like this.
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  We have the only tri-iodine out there.
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  It's 50% off.
[57:07.000 --> 57:12.000]  And we have 25% off on the highest quality, swarble foods you're going to find for the price.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  Did you pay five times more to get something better?
[57:14.000 --> 57:19.000]  Yeah, but for good quality, clean, tasty food, this is the lowest price you're going to find anywhere,
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.000]  and this is what I use for my family.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  They haven't done 25% off in four years.
[57:22.000 --> 57:29.000]  It's 25% off until Monday at preparewithalix.com.
[57:29.000 --> 57:34.000]  Preparewithalix.com or infoworkstore.com or call toll free.
[57:34.000 --> 57:37.000]  Triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[57:37.000 --> 57:38.000]  Hey, will this save you?
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  No, but it's part of the way you're getting there.
[57:40.000 --> 57:41.000]  Jesus will save you.
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.000]  This will get you prepared.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  Preparewithalix.com.
[57:44.000 --> 58:10.000]  Get it all to this.
[58:10.000 --> 58:16.000]  We're going to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision,
[58:16.000 --> 58:23.000]  suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[58:23.000 --> 58:29.000]  that are exposing all their lies, their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030,
[58:29.000 --> 58:32.000]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  And none of it can succeed.
[58:34.000 --> 58:39.000]  None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gaslit.
[58:39.000 --> 58:43.000]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[58:43.000 --> 58:47.000]  And that's why it's hard to share in Full Wars links and band up video links.
[58:47.000 --> 58:50.000]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[58:50.000 --> 58:55.000]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on
[58:55.000 --> 58:58.000]  both at home and the world at large.
[58:58.000 --> 59:02.000]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of,
[59:02.000 --> 59:06.000]  our new sleep support formula, down and out, is just the thing.
[59:06.000 --> 59:13.000]  It's our new faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[59:13.000 --> 59:18.000]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, knockout, with down and out,
[59:18.000 --> 59:24.000]  now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[59:24.000 --> 59:28.000]  So ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[59:28.000 --> 59:32.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower,
[59:32.000 --> 59:36.000]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees,
[59:36.000 --> 59:39.000]  who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[59:39.000 --> 59:42.000]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep,
[59:42.000 --> 59:45.000]  because you will be down and out.
[59:45.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  Tell it out now at www.ephorstore.com.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are Back Live Broadcasting Worldwide.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  Coming up, I have the Canadian Prime Minister's brother joining us
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  to talk about what it's like to be a Canadian to see this tyranny,
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  but to also see Canada as an example worldwide of standing up to evil.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  Here's the live show feed headline for today.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  World Exclusive.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  Globalists only planning to pause lockdowns,
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  masked mandates, forced injections long enough until large crowds disappear.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  This is a tried and true globalist strategy.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  They exploit their narrative control and the attention span of the masses
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  to slowly but surely get what they want,
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  only by being aware of their lies and playing a long-term game.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  Can we defeat them?
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  Also, Justin Trudeau's brother is joining us live on air
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  to discuss the dictatorship now being established by his siblings' controllers.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  So that is coming up next segment.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  But I want to play a clip.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  It's a short clip from Tucker Carlson.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  And I'll get more into this in the third hour on this crack pipe thing.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  You know, I saw this crack pipe thing on Monday during the show.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  No, it was before the show.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  And I didn't believe it at first.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  I went and looked at it and I mentioned it on air and said, this is just crazy.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  And then it started breaking in the news Tuesday, Wednesday and now Thursday.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  But this is the type of story that can really wake people up.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  This is the type of thing that will really, I call it a Rosetta Stone or a skeleton key,
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  that if you understand this, you understand it all.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  I mean, the Babylon Bee had a headline out today that $30 billion or $20 billion,
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  I forget the exact number, of hypothetical money is going to be given by the Biden
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  administration to white urban soccer moms in wine glasses so they can drink out of safe wine glasses.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  Now, given $30 million of crack pipes that they say are assigned to black people,
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  is as insane as saying we're going to give white soccer moms wine glasses.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  And all over the Western world, they're now putting crack pipes in vending machines
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  because the government's shipping this crap in, folks.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  They want you using it.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  It's all selectively enforced.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  Yeah, there it is.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  There's the headline right there.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  Biden administration announces new program to give white suburban women free wine glasses.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  Now, that's a joke, but this isn't a joke.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  And I made the point of like, imagine if you walked up to random black people and said,
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  here, I've got watermelon for you.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  At least that doesn't kill them, but that's a very racist thing, very stereotypical.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  But this is a, oh no, you're black.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  You need $30 million in crack pipes.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  Here's Tucker Carlson talking about it.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson's Night.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  We've got news for you this evening.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  Joe Biden, the president, has announced another piece of his highly promoted equity agenda.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  That's the government wide effort to improve the lives of African Americans.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  You may recall that on his first day in office more than a year ago,
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  the new president explained that equity will require determination and creativity.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  And this week he proved that's true.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  Joe Biden's latest idea is to pay black people to smoke more crack.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  Going forward, the administration will send at least $30 million in tax money to nonprofits and local governments
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  so they can purchase, quote, safe smoking kits and supplies.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  According to HHS, these kits will contain Joe Biden-approved pipes
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  that will allow beneficiaries of the equity agenda to smoke crack cocaine as well as crystal meth.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  Some say it's about time.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  Soros-aligned NGOs have long complained that marginalized groups in this country
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  don't have adequate access to illegal narcotics or the tools to use them.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  With this new program, Joe Biden will finally close the crack gap.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  For too long in America, quality crack pipes have been the domain of rich white men like so much else.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Here's the president's son, for example, smoking crack in bed at the Four Seasons.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  You'll notice the beautifully designed custom crack pipe.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  It's cooling bowl nestled in the high-thread count Egyptian cotton sheets.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  When Hunter Biden smokes crack, he does it in style.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  But not everyone in this country is so fortunate.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  Try to toast some rock in West Baltimore sometime.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  You may have to make the pipe yourself.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  From tin foil or a broken car antenna, our inner cities are pipe deserts.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  Most importantly, your immune system.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  So, X3, the only tri-iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50%off at mforwardstore.com.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body takes about two weeks to kick it on average,
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  you really need to experience X3.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the Info War.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  A true 360 win.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  So again, X3, back at stock, 50% off.
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:04.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  Here we are in the second hour of this live Thursday, February 10th transmission.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  And we have the biological brother of the Prime Minister of Canada joining us right now to talk about this incredible situation.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  The eyes of the world are focused on.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  The small fringe minority of people who are on their way to Ottawa,
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  or who are holding unacceptable views that they're expressing,
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  do not represent the views of Canadians who have been there for each other,
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  who know that following the science and stepping up to protect each other
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  is the best way to continue to ensure our freedoms, our rights, our values as a country.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  We are not intimidated by those who hurl insults and abuse at small business workers
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  and steal food from the homeless.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  We won't give in to those who fly racist flags.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  We won't cave to those who engage in vandalism or dishonor the memory of our veterans.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  So to those responsible for this behavior, it needs to stop.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  The level of admiration I actually have for China.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  Because they're basic dictatorship.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  Regardless of the fact that we are attacking your fundamental rights
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  or limiting your fundamental rights, and the Charter says that wrong,
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  we're still going to go ahead and do it.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  You know, you grow up and if you're a history buff like I am,
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  you read about Stalin and Hitler and Mao and you think, how do they put up with that?
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  And then you watch what our country's done, invading Iraq and murdering all these innocent people
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  and just all the lies, and you go, wow, we're pretty evil too.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  I mean, at least our rulers are.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  And if we don't do something about them, that means we're guilty.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  Well, the Canadians, I've always compared them to the nicest people I've ever known,
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  the Midwesterners.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  Folks always said, Texans are really nice, and they are nice, unless you cross them.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  But Midwesterners seem really friendly and nice, and the Canadians all know have been crazy nice.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  The cliché is true, and then you can only be nice too far until it gets to a point
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  until you're destroying yourself.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  So, Canada's been so subservient for two years under tyranny,
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  now they are standing up peacefully doing it right all over their country,
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  not just in the capital in Ottawa, and it's a beautiful thing.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  And then I saw an interview for the first time,
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  who'd started to break into a viral, didn't know about it,
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  with Kyle Kemper, who's the half-brother of the current leader of Canada.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  And so I checked him out, and indeed, you know, they've got the same mother,
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  they know each other, and I thought, why not get a Canadian on,
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  who also happens to be the brother of Justin Trudeau,
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  to talk about the great reset in Klaus Schwab and what it's like being up there,
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  and just his perspective.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  So, he's a father, entrepreneur, advisor, writer, mentor,
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  connector, problem solver, activator, and critical thinker.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  Kyle first tuned into the All-in-one show following his epic bullhorning
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  of the BDB meeting, a Bilderberg meeting in Ottawa,
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  that's who runs his brother, way back in the day.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  And by the way, the same group tried to hire me.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  I mean, I had the Kissinger group invite me to do what his brother did.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  I'm not, you know, it's just crazy.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  He is the half-brother of Justin Trudeau.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  He's on Twitter at KyleKemper and LoveAndFreedomShow.com.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  So, Kyle, great to have you on with us.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  Thank you so much. Where do you want to start, brother?
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  I just want to first give you some credit and gratitude, Alex.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  I really appreciate all the hard work that you've been doing over the years
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  towards awakening people to the truth.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  And I also want to wish you a happy birthday in advance.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  Well, thank you, brother. It's great to have you here.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  There's so much to talk about.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  And where do you want to start?
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  Because all eyes are on Canada worldwide.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  Well, I'd like to say that, you know, what's taking place in Canada
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  is we've seen two years of fear and oppression
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  and watching our rights and our fundamental rights be taken away
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  through a highly coordinated, sophisticated media campaign
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  brought to us by the corporatocracy using fear as a means to control people,
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  presenting hope as the idea of this bake-back scene is going to be the solution.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  And, you know, enough is enough. Many Canadians succumb to it
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  and they watch their rights and freedoms continue to be pressed and stressed.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  And now, you know, they've awoke the truckers
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  and the truckers represent a spearhead that Canadians are uniting under
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  just like the mass psychosis where, you know, people were lost
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  and didn't know where to go and have been channeling their hate towards, you know, the unvaccinated.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  The same thing is happening here with people who haven't had any path forward or any hope.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  And in Canada, too, I mean, it's been, you know, there's been a lack of human connection
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  and love and basic humanity that people would demoralize.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  But now there's this great occurrence that's happened where Canadians
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  with all backgrounds are coming together with one word in mind
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  and that word is freedom and what's taking place in Ottawa right now is truly incredible.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  I heard those words that, you know, Justin was saying
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  and they do not reflect what's actually going on the ground.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  With our show, the Love and Freedom show, we've been live streaming
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  and talking to truckers and going out in the streets and interviewing people
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  and it's more like, I don't know, it's almost like a festival.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  I kind of call it freezing man because it's like burning man north.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  People are working together, it's super clean, the vibration is high
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  and there's a clear message that is love and freedom and unity.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  It's nonviolent, there are provocateurs who are trying to encourage violence
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  and courage, you know, negative behavior but this group is really well grounded
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  and passionate about freedom and they're not, you know, the whole world is watching
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  and I feel like this is a major, major happening and, you know, I'm great
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  and I feel a personal duty to, you know, to speak out and stand up for Canadians.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  It is beautiful what's happening is one of the places we said,
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  why is Canada asleep and now it's leading everybody out of this,
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  all the world a great example of chain reaction.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  Two big things they're mad about, I've noticed in the Canadian controlled state run press,
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  they're mad that it's a very diverse crowd and they're mad that there's children like,
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  oh, these are human shields, no, people brought their children
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  and so they're having trouble assaulting it with riot police
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  because the symbol is now the pink bouncy castle,
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  not the made up Nazi swastikas that your brother's talking about.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  Bouncy castles and, you know, I was speaking to a trucker,
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  all the letters of love and support that all of them have,
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  like every single trucker has a box full of handwritten letters from children
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  and passionate Canadians.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  I look at, like, my inboxes and they are just full of messages of love
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  and support and yearning for freedom
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  and also there's a lot of anger out there
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  and I think one of the other angles that they're really pushing with this
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  is this F. Trudeau kind of narrative and I get it.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  I get that people are really angry.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  But I'd rather have stopped the great reset,
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  stop the world lockdown, free humanity, investigate gain of function, exactly.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  I don't think we should just make it about your brother or Biden or any of these front guys.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  We should be, I don't mean to steal your, is that what you're about to say?
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  I think we should make it about the evil agenda
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  and bring all of humanity together, not making about your brother,
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  not making about the puppets.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  And more than anything, too, is what is our ideal outcome of this, Alex?
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  That's something I want to ask you because you are so powerful in portraying
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  and kind of manifesting your seed, like, you know, what you're building and creating.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  What is our ideal outcome?
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  I mean, I know it's like freedom is what we want,
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  but I also recognize we're in this age transition
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  where the old systems will not port into the new one.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  I think the goal is this. Let's talk about that, brother.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  We want a peaceful transition out of the fourth turning into the fourth era.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  And we don't want to have a big giant war and billions dead in that.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  We want the old elites to know, hey, we're not going to kill you.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  You can even keep your stolen wealth to stop trying to kill us and stop.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  I think the goal is a global awakening, what you just said,
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  and a transcendence just by we're not going to be part of this that we see coming out of Canada.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  Nothing can stop the great awakening of humanity.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  Wow. So we're definitely dialed in.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  And that's it.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  Don't let them derail our great awakening and don't let the old corrupt evil forces,
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  because the other last age wasn't evil, but what's left trying to hold on to its evil.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  And it needs to go just turn loose and just say, hey,
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  just like David Rockefeller, turn loose, Bill Gates, Henry Kisses, your Queen of England, Prince Charles, just turn loose.
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  You're not going to control us. Just give up.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  We don't want to destroy you. Stop trying to destroy us.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  We'll be right back with Kyle Kemper, an impressive fellow with loveandfreedomshow.com.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  Stay with us. Listen to that sound of freedom.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  Thanks for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly, your immune system.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  So X3, the only tri iodine on the market, highest grade,

[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.

[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  With all the craziness going on in the world, with the globalists plotting their next big lockdown,
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  with the next phase of the Great Reset being a stage-cyber attack,
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  with the deep state pushing a civil war, not just here, but in Europe and war with Russia,
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  with the massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place, like supply chain rate nouns,
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  you need to get prepared now with high-quality, storable food that is ready to ship.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  And it's been four years since my Patriot supply at preparewithalex.com has offered their storable food at 25% off.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  Four years, but right now, it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  A little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at preparewithalex.com
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  on the entire catalog of my Patriot supply.

[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  and we're almost sold out of the product. Everybody needs to have storable food to be prepared

[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  Some of the proprietary super ingredients behind Brain Force Ultra include
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  Garamaseep, which is loaded with energy compounds and antioxidants that have been used by Amazonian tribes for centuries,
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  AlphaGPC, a natural compound found in the brain that delivers an essential nutrient, Koli,
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  and Ginkoli, which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant content.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  This product is more than twice the servings of our Brain Force Plus as well,
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  so you know it's packed full of the good stuff.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  Destroy that brain fog today and secure your bottle of Brain Force Ultra before it is completely sold out at infowarstor.com.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  Hollywood, Stanley Kubrick with all his mastery, did not come up with a sound, all the production staff,
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  and all the orchestras of the world, that eerie.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  I sat there in my office at home, it's got a high depth stereo,
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  pretend a turntable I've got that lists the records on sometimes,
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  and I plugged that into the digital input and played it,
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  and it was just a different clip for like an hour the other day, and it's so eerie.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  I don't know if over AM radio or FM radio you can hear that,
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  but you've got to go out and find the music that they're making,
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  and it's like a warning, it's like, nah, it's like this, it's over,
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  and it's all these thousands and thousands of people with different horns and different sounds coming together
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  and echoing in those buildings.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  And I see the projection, the most classical inversion by the Ottawa City Council people
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  and by the Prime Minister saying, you're holding us hostage,
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  you're not letting us leave our homes, you're bankrupting us.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  When this is, truckers told you must take these experimental shots and be tracked everywhere you go
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  with this app and live time, where you travel and go,
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  or we won't let you have your job, and they're saying no,
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  we're going to come protest, which is the most basic thing of any free society,
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  and all these leftist operatives and graduates of the Davos group
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  literally say, we need paramilitary.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  They're terrorists, they're seditionists, they're traitors, they're guilty of treason.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  These are all words, not just the Canadian news,
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  but the French news, and the British news, and the German news, and the U.S. news.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  All, I'm sure you've all seen it folks, it's all over M4s,
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  but just yesterday I watched dozens of clips of them just viciously like attack dogs
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  from Geraldo Rivera on Fox, do you name it?
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  Just saying, these people are the scum of the earth.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  Kyle Kemper is a talk show host and a writer and advisor and entrepreneur and father,
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  and he is a critical thinker, and he's also the half-brother of the other mother
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  of the current leader who says he wishes he could have a dictatorship.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  So in this shorter segment, longer segments coming up, Kyle,
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  what is it like on the ground?
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  Where do you see this going?
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  Now the police are quitting en masse, both federal and local,
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  so they won't be part of it.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  As you know, one of your judges said, stop stealing their gas.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  So it really seems beyond stalemate.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  It looks like the establishment up there has really met something they can't deal with.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  I mean, I think the entire global establishment, Alex,
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  has met something that they can't deal with,
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  and we're seeing them in scramble mode right now and in damage control.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  People are waking up, and this is not like a G20 protest that's full of provocateurs,
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  and it has just a violent agitation or a BLM kind of protest that had violence and hate at its core.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  This is a love-driven, I wouldn't even call it a protest, it's an experience.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  It's a gathering.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  It's a gathering.
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  It's unbelievable, and they're not reporting some things.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  Crime in Ottawa is way, way, way down.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  The streets are cleaner than they've ever been,
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  and you're even seeing from the police chief say this is an increasingly dangerous and escalating situation.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  They're like, no, that is just pure, that is false.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  It is peaceful to the core,
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  and the organizers have made repeated requests to sit down with this city to discuss
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  how this can be even better and safer.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  That's right, that's key.
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  They're not terrorists who blew something up and demanded something.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  They showed up peacefully to the terrorist and said,
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  we want Parley, we want to speak to you before the trucks got there,
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  and they've never even talked to them and respected them like they're human.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  And they didn't just show up.
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  They drove all across Canada in an enormous convoy with every single overpass packed with people.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  It presented an opportunity for people to come together and realize that they are not alone.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  A number of people of my friends who have said to me that I'm not afraid anymore
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  because I see all the people, like we are awakened to this.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  The energy is of a higher vibration.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  And I feel like this is a great threat to this agenda that you talk about at length.
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  We know internal documents just to add to what you're saying came out
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  that they want to make people depressed and get us into an act of being broken so they can program us.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  They literally don't want us at a high spiritual connected level.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  Right, and when you get people together and when there's energy and there's communal effort
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  and things are decommodified, like what's taking place not all right now
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  is there is so much gifting and sharing and communal activity all with a civic responsibility built into it.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  There's a sense of immediacy towards getting things done and they're aiming to leave no trace as well.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  And all those that I just mentioned are all part of like the principles of Burning Man,
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  which has been an incredible abundant festival that over the years has been morphing and growing.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  And now that we're seeing those higher vibrations spreading out and it's influenced this gathering
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  and the speeches are incredible.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  Well, I totally agree because the global lockdowns, remember what one of your Canadian health ministers said,
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  we can't let them organize. They might disagree with us and talk to each other.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  That's a quote. They are so scared of us coming together.
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  That's why they want churches closed. Why are they so scared of us coming together and being physically around each other?
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  Indeed. And same with like the restaurants, like closing down the restaurants.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  I was in Whistler last year and they would not even let me talk to another table.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  It was absolutely crazy.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  That's why I had to leave. I had to leave Canada. I'm not in Canada right now.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  I wished for the first time in a long time. I wish I was in Ottawa,
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  but I'm doing my part from afar towards aiding.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  Brother, I don't blame you, man. It's been scary as hell up there.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  It's been bizarre and so disconnected.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  At the same time, they never stopped the alcohol from flowing.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  They just stopped it from people gathering to drink alcohol.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  It was like, keep going to the stores and buy it and consume it at home.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  We also legalized marijuana too.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  All of a sudden everybody can get baked out of their minds with this.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  Netflix has never been stronger in the programming within it.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  The sports, obviously the sports kept going and they did not allow it.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  All of this was done because they are afraid of the white awakening.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  It's even in the WikiLeaks. They're afraid of this. They call it an awakening.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  They're so scared.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  And this is the critical thing and nothing will stop it.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  We are in this age transition. It's like it's a done deal.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  And the great reset I feel like is their answer and their desired ideal outcome.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  And what I want to talk to you maybe in our next segment is let's talk about ideal outcomes.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  Let's discuss what can we do as a collective?
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  I totally agree.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  What should these masses of people around the world be saying their goals are other than we don't want to be locked up and be slaves?
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  Start talking about what an ideal outcome and a communal outcome could be.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  Not asking for, not seeking to ask these guys to continue to hold on to power to release.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  But to just say, what are we going to do?
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  What are we going to do?
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  Is our system of governance still appropriate?
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  It was invented in a time when there was an electricity.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  When you actually had to have representatives from geographical regions to make decisions at a federal level.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  But now we can send a message from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean in a millisecond.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  So the fundamentals have changed and I think it's time that we start having real discussions of inclusive open debate about what we want to see,
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  what the ideal outcomes look like, how can we start building towards that?
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  How can we turn this pyramid upside down so that it's not the few controlling the many,
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  but the many witnessing and holding accountable the few?
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  That's right. And I know that's coming. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  Suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lies,
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  And none of it can succeed. None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:53.000]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  And that's why it's hard to share in Full Wars links and band-up video links.
[1:29:56.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  The only tri iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:40.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body takes about two weeks to get on average,
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  you really need to experience X3. Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the info war, a true 360 win.
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:59.000]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off at a limited time.
[1:30:59.000 --> 1:31:03.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome.
[1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  Hello, Alex.
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  Yes, Malcolm.
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer.
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:19.000]  Supermail Vialtality and Brainforce Plus. Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable tank.
[1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:21.000]  Supermail Vialtality really, really works.
[1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:26.000]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:33.000]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well but just aren't as strong.
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:37.000]  This is like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch is different.
[1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:45.000]  That's just how it is. It's how it works.
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:53.000]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul.
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet, I've had a lot of loss like everybody else has.
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  And I see the general public in a medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled tranty.
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder and it's so incredibly sad.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:51.000]  But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:33:07.000]  It's just the globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:31.000]  You know, it's not just in Exodus in the Old Testament, 3000 plus years old.
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  It's not just in Charlton Heston movie, The Ten Commandments.
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  It's carved on the Egyptian walls of their temples about Ramses.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  Ramses II of memory serves and the Jews leaving and being expelled and all the things that happened.
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  And that was a big turning in that time and why had Ramses father ordered all the first born Israelite boys killed.
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  That was done all over the Middle East, all over Asia, all over Europe, all over Mesoamerica.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  And you think, well, the ancient people in what's Mexico today, 3000 years ago, were they talking to, you know, were the Mayans?
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  That was before the Aztecs. It was the same people, different culture.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  Were the Toltecs, the Olmecs, were they talking to Ramses the first, sacrificing Jewish boys?
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  No, but there was something making them do it.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  But see, no one I know has a compulsion to want to have sex with children.
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  No one I know has, or they never told me, I know I don't, a compulsion to kill first born children.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  I want to take care of children, love children. They just make you feel high when you're around them.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  But there's something in humans twisted that does that and when you read the public statements by Ted Turner and Bill Gates and all of them,
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  they say there's too many people, Klaus Schwab, we've got to get rid of them.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  Well, were there too many people in the time of Plato 2300 years ago?
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  Were there too many Greeks? He thought they should be, most of them should be killed.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  So there's this instinct to depopulate in ruling classes, and now they see the big populations and the issues and the problems,
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  and their instinct is kill a bunch of us and shut us down and make us prisoners, and that'll fix all the problems.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  I think that's a problem in the ruling class, not a problem in us.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  But so you're talking about positive things, Carl Kemper.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  I want to get some of the negative things and anything you can add about your brother and what makes him tick.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  If people want to hear that, I mean, who else endorses Chinese-style dictatorship and says I want to be a dictator,
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  and who else says you're not allowed to criticize me, and yeah, you got basic rights in the charter, we're going to take those away.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  I mean, it's like a cartoon character.
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  I was trying to destroy myself, I would act like him, but to understand the fourth turning, I agree with the scientists and historians,
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  that's not mumbo jumbo, it's historic political, cultural fourth turning, but it's also aligned with a lot of other things that are going on.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  We know there's cycles, and we're going out of a very crazy cycle into another cycle that generally cycles are very positive at the beginning
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  and then go into the cataclysm point, and as you said, the globalists want to create a global crisis to artificially control the collapse
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  because they know there's cycles they can't control, so maybe if they trigger it first, they think they can ride the dragon.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  So get into where you think that's going, and then I want to talk about some of the problems that we face
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  and how that ties into the depopulation we see there attempting again.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  Right.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  You know, I would say specifically to Justin, I'll just talk to him for a second, he likes approval and he likes to be loved and liked,
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  I think like many people do, like it's natural for the ego to want that.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  So, I mean, at this moment, I can only imagine, and I feel like, you know, his heart being greatly hurt by what's taking place
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  because an enormous amount of Canadians are incredibly frustrated and have lost faith and have become disconnected from him.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  And now it seems like, you know, only people you can kind of turn to for approval are, you know, the people behind the curtains.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  And I just, I feel, and you kind of got a little bit biblical about that, and someone told me about the story of Matthew
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  and how he went to the top of the mountain when he was offered everything as long as he gave in.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  You know, I think a lot of people have taken that option where Jesus did not take, you know, that.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  And he pursued, like, you know, because, you know, he presented the option that the Kingdom of Heaven can be realized here on Earth.
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  And I think it's really important that we stay in the light and that the whole COVID, whatever this thing has been, it's been chaos.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  And one of the things, if you look at the field of cinematics, if you put sand on a vibration board and you change the vibration,
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  it goes from one sacred pattern to another.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  But between the shifts of patterns, there is chaos.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  And whether this was evil and dark or whether this was somehow divine as well, there's been great darkness, but there's also great light.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  And this is one of these... No, I totally agree. And I want to pull that up.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  What is that call they discovered? And it matches all the Indian and Hindu symbols on their temples that now they know different sounds,
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  create different, incredible sacred geometry, the lotus stars, all of it.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  And literally, you can just, what's that call? You send it through a metal pan.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  And then... Cymatics.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  Cymatics. Guys, pull up on YouTube, Cymatics. It's incredible.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  And by the way, there was a scientist, I forget, a mathematician, a French mathematician who was over 100 years ago, I forget his name.
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  I'm not good at pronouncing French, but he predicted that every flew a probe over Saturn that it would have Cymatics
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  because of its giant size that would manifest an interdimensional force showing a hexagon on the top.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  And when they flew Voyager over it, there it was, brother. I mean, that is incredible.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  Right. And it's like, as you'll notice, between these shifts, and I think as the vibration gets going even higher,
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  it's a little bit more chaotic, but then it settles.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  Yeah, in between right there.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  Into these beautiful patterns. And there is so much beauty in nature.
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  And one of the things is we are living in this age of abundance.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  And one of the tools that these, you know, the few are trying to use against the many is control suppression and this illusion of scarcity.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  You must fight against the other. For me to have one thing means somebody else can't have it.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  It's like a game of monopoly. It's a terrible game.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  But, you know, if you like the game of Catan, perhaps, Catan is a fantastic game.
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  But imagine if you played Catan with everybody and you all tried to, like, you know, develop the world to the best of your abilities.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  That is the opportunity that we have now through radical collaboration of awakened, innovative, creative people.
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  Everybody has their role in one shape or another to participate in this.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  Instead of, like, you know, criticizing being negative about the situation.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  It's important to understand the reality of the situation and to criticize it by creating.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  I totally agree. The best way is not to even fight something. It's to build something new.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  That's why Christ didn't get behind me, Satan, because Christ isn't even fighting Satan.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  Christ is moving forward, creating the new universe.
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  But what would you say more to your brother?
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  So you're saying he's not inherently evil. He's just a follower.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  I mean, he literally worships Klaus Schwab. He does seem very childlike.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  He believes this, and it comes across like he really believes it.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  Whereas with the other globalists, they're, like, laughing and giggling and know it's a joke.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  Is your brother literally, like, mind-controlled or in a trance?
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  I mean, I can't say for certain, but I think those are very good hypotheses.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  I think, you know, he is not free. He is not living a freedom life.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  I've had a chance to witness over the last decade the reality of his situation.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  He has security details around him all the time, which protects him, but it also traps him.
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  I mean, imagine being in an open-air prison all the time.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  I don't believe he's not able to come on the show. He doesn't engage in open discussion or debate about topics.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  I think this is really critical because when you're promoting an agenda that is inherently deceptive and is based on lies,
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  you can't debate them.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  We've seen this with the whole climate change, like Fiasco.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  Trust me, I believe in the environment and being a good steward of the environment,
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  but their agenda is totally different than taking care of the environment.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  And the truth is open to debate. It stands up to debate. Let's debate it.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  Let's have open discussions about the censorship, the misinformation, the double-speak at all levels.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  Well, that's right. Something that's good can survive being challenged.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  Only something evil can't be challenged.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  Let's come back then with Carl Kemper, brother of the prime minister of Canada.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  Give us his take on the lockdowns, where he thinks Canada is going.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  I think the Globals are kind of turning off some of their control right now just to make us go back to sleep.
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  They're going to bring it back. I want to get his take on that straight ahead.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  This is Carl Kemper.
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  This is Carl Kemper.
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  This is Carl Kemper.
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  This is Carl Kemper.
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  William of California, people are asleep and programmed controlled.
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  I agree. How do you make the sleeper awaken, William?
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  Oh, hi, Alice. Thanks for taking my call.
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  Can I plug, uh, Alice, real quick?
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  Yeah, go ahead.
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  Hey, I'm in my sixties, uh, and I did the work of twenty-five thirty-year-olds,
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  and I worked them into the ground, and you wanted to why?
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  I tested this, and I've taken your B-12, and let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price.
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  I really do. I take that B-12, and I'm electric, man.
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  I can run ten miles. I do some pretty heavy work, uh, with the highway department,
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  and my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah, for a guy in his sixties, you know, pushing seventy,
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  and I know I'm not just blowing smoke here. The B-12 saves my life.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food. It's all come out.
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the creator,
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  and we are powerful. And the social engineers fear that so much.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy.
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  Is it true?
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God of this world who is a loser.
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep Info Wars in the air now more than ever.
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe handling.
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  Info Wars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  This Info Wars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the Info Wars store.
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions including those with osteoarthritis
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition,
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations like here in America.
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  There's a lot of their propaganda and brainwashing through science fiction where they're pre-programming us.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  By saying all science fiction is bad it's great.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  I've learned that that's like their religious tax basically with some of the key writers.
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  And that's what they're projecting and planning for humanity.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  So I know the different agendas they've got.
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  And so yes there's a human awakening and humanity is going to the next level.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  Not everybody is going to do that or be part of that.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  That's just the way it is.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  But the globalists plan massive global power outages.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  They blame on cyber attacks.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  They plan wars.
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  They plan viral releases.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  They brag how they're going to do this in Operation Lockstep and others.
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  British Ministry of Defense document 2007.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  I forget the exact name of it, but it's flash mobs, brain chips, grim vision of the future,
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  and government ministry of defense report.
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  You can pull that up.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  Type it when I said it will come up.
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  Flash mobs, brain chips, a ministry of defense, grim vision of the future.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  And then I learned that I'd read stuff when they wrote in the 60s and it happened by the 80s.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  And stuff they said in the 80s happened by the 2000s.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  So I've learned that they're not just doing all this playing games.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  And it's trying to take control of the human cycle and play God.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  It's a control freak thing.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  It's done from that position.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  But instead they're trying to alter the normal course of humanity
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  and they're causing more disturbance and more danger in my view.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  And I think that's what Kyle Kemper, who is the half brother of the current leader of Canada, Justin Trudeau,
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  other points you'd like to make.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  And I've got a few other questions.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  Well, I mean, you just mentioned something about the science fiction writing.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  So like Brave New World was a book that I read in school like very, very long ago.
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  And I've since reread it.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  And a lot of these people, they saw what was coming and they've projected it.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  And one of the things that they did in Brave New World was that when people were getting agitated
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  or starting to ask questions, they dosed them with Soma.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  So they just spray Soma in the air.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  And two days ago here in California, I looked at the, well, right now I look out the window and look at the sky
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  and it is a beautiful, clear, perfect sky.
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  Two days ago, this sky all the way south to San Diego, all the way north to LA,
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  had hundreds of streamers that created a gigantic blanket which just settled down.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  What do you think about that, Alex?
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  Well, they've declassified that they're manipulating the weather with that.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  It's a huge declassified program that is still classified in the details.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  Geoengineering, Bill Gates runs it with the Department of Energy.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  But there's also, I told people 10 years ago, weaponized marijuana.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  Some not against people smoking marijuana, but the stuff now is 10, 20, 30 times stronger.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  It's psychotropic.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  And that's why George Soros and the system is pushing it because you smoke that, you're on another planet.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  Same thing with all the liquor stores are all open, but the churches are closed.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  The parks are closed.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  The gyms are closed.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  The libraries are closed.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  Anything good for you is closed.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  Anything bad.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  And I'm not saying a beer or something with friends.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  It's meant ritualistically.
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  It's small doses.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  But buy yourself and your house, drink and Jack Daniels, get ready to die.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  And everything they do, like handing out $300 million or $30 million in crack pipes to black people,
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  it's all a sick joke by these globalists.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  I mean, I can't even believe that, like that is just so absurd.
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  And like the tolerance of people to accept these things, same with the rituals that are taking place.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  Like, you know, the children wearing the masks, people were all explained rituals.
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  You're a smart guy.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  These are all rituals of enslavement, rituals that were dirty, rituals that we are the criminals.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  Yeah.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  And it's also like just showing compliance.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  Like if you can get, if you can do something that you know in your heart doesn't make any sense,
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  because like, you know, you're afraid of what might take place,
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  like you're basically giving them your power.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  It's a tyranny test.
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  So let me ask you this.
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  Let's talk more about your brother because I didn't just get you on the dig dirt on your brother.
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  And I understand you're trying to lovingly, you know, wake him up.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  But he is one of the only world leaders that you see him saying this stuff.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  He looks like he believes it.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  The others, it's completely obvious that they're not buying into this.
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  So knowing him and what's going on, you really think he is just doing this for approval and is in a police state cocoon?
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  I think he accepted that deal on the top of the mountain.
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  And now he is under control, you know, by, by others.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  And I think, you know, he's in a really unique position right now.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  And, you know, my advice to him and I think the advice of all the truckers and like, you know,
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  freedom loving people of the world is, you know, step down, resign, get out, die a symbolic political death and trigger the great awakening of humanity
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  and show that freedom is powerful and that civic responsibility and using our collective voices to stand up to oppression and tyranny is a actionable, viable solution,
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  especially when it's done, you know, using love and high vibrations and music and connection and collective communal effort.
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  Like that's what needs to happen.
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  Kyle, this is beautiful. I want you to repeat this and expand on it because I don't know what headline I'd give this interview today.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  We're live right now. Millions of folks are tuning in, but I wanted to archive it.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  So hundreds of thousands or millions may end up watching it later.
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  But what you just said is incredible.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  I don't think your brother's pure evil at the end of the day.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  That's how he's tricked and still comes off as more credible even though he's telling lies.
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  I'm like, how does, you know, all these other leaders look totally fake?
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  Boris Johnson, Macron, Merkel, Biden.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  But with him, he looks like he actually believes it, but I know it's a lie.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  How could he convince his eyes to look like that?
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  Well, he just basically is captured by this.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  He may still have some good in him like Darth Vader.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  And if he came out and said, I was lied to, I was wrong, I'm resigning.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  Not to hold on to power to say he was wrong.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  I'm resigning. We should bring down the great reset in Klaus Schwab.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  We should unify humanity.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  If he wants to be loved, he would then be loved and help bring us out of this.
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  I mean, I would love to see him do that.
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  Look at that photo, global citizen, like this guy.
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  He had a wonderful run of all sorts of amazing experiences in his eyes,
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  but at the sacrifice of so many and the spending and the effects that will have
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  if we continue in this existing framework, you know, will damage all Canadians.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  But, you know, for him, it's again, it's this concept of just surrender, just release.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  Doesn't mean you have to go and like, you know, wave a wave flag and put yourself in handcuffs and go over.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  Just surrender to the will of the people.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  Be clear, you've lost the mandate of the people.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  People don't believe you.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  You cannot, there's no way he could get Canadians to come out to a rally right now.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  Like, you might be able to get, you know, a whole, like, you know, fill of room with blue checkmarks from Twitter
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  who are paid to be there and paid to repeat his talking points.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  But I was about to say, because he's such a pool of water, like a mirror.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  He looks totally freaked out now.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  Like, the other globalists don't know how to act like they're winning.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  I think he knows now he's been destroyed.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  I mean, you know your brother better than other people.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  I mean, aren't you picking up now?
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  He looks pretty deflated.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  Yeah, I mean, black photo, like that one was that whole interview is kind of weird for a number of reasons.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  But, yeah, he's definitely like, you know, it's wearing on him.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  And like, you know, it doesn't have the support of the people.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  So again, just surrender to this, like, you know, reconnect with source, reconnect with soul,
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  like, you know, start going through the process of healing.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  You know, it's like in the Catholic church, like, confess and repent and like, take your penance towards this.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  That's right, by admitting you're wrong, that's really the beginning of healing.
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  Hey, have you talked to your brother lately?
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  I have not.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  No.
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  We had a breakdown.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  I mean, last time I talked to him, I think it was on my wedding day when I had invited them to come and be part of it.
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  But I had a very large wedding planned and everything was rolling.
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  But then all the stuff happened and, you know, our venue was owned by the Shopify folks.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  And they were also, Shopify is also very complicit in promoting the agenda in Canada and stoking the fear,
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  which really frustrated me because...
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  So how long ago was that?
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  Did your wedding get shut down by the COVID?
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  That was 8, 8, 2020.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  So, yeah.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  So anyways, we had a beautiful sacred ceremony of like, you know, a small gathering.
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  It was absolutely lovely.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  But, you know, once all this passes, we'll have a big celebration and many people can come together.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  In my view, statistically smaller weddings, what marriages last longer.
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  I'm not putting anybody down that has big weddings, but, you know, to me, it's about a man and a woman together.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  And, you know, that's what it's really all about and where they're at.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  All right, brother, do five more minutes with us.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  Kyle Kemper is a really interesting fellow and I want to just get his prediction when we come back
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  on what he thinks ends up happening in Canada and how the rest of the world.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  And then we're going to open up the phones in the third hour today, Thursday, February 10th, 2022.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  Please don't forget, we're funded by you, T-shirts, books, films, high-quality, wearable food, 50% off on X3.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  All of it, infowarstores.com.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  Transhumanist nightmare vision.
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  Suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  that are exposing all their lies, their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030,
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  And none of it can succeed.
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:45.000]  And that's why it's hard to share infowarstlinks and bandavideo.links.
[1:58:45.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  And it's been four years since my patriot supply at preparewithalix.com has offered their storeable food at 25% off.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:31.000]  Four years, but right now it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022.
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:41.000]  A little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at preparewithalix.com on the entire catalog of my patriot supply.
[1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:47.000]  Act now, get prepared now. This is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:21.000]  Carl Kemper is a father, entrepreneur, writer, mentor, problem solver, activator, critical thinker,
[2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  websites loveandfreedomshow.com on Twitter at Carl Kemper.
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  And he's the brother of the current prime minister.
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  He's trying to establish a biomedical tyranny and hailing that Klaus Schwab is his master.
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  In the five minutes we have left, what else would you like to get across to this audience?
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  To the whole audience, thank you, Alex. To the whole audience, I would like to just thank you and say that I have been with the truth and freedom movement for a very long time.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  And I know it can become a little bit like we recognize there's a lot of danger out there, but it's critically important that at this time right now that we move forward
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  and that we embrace love and freedom and we try and heal because the future is about unity as a collective.
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  And sure, we recognize there is a class of people that have done a lot of damage, but we need to heal.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  We need to heal our families. We need to heal our relationships with our friends.
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  We need to start thinking about abundance and collective and radical collaboration towards building new systems.
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  And by the way, just to interrupt you, I feel that drive. I've always felt that drive since I was a child, but it went away, not completely away,
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  but now the last year it's so strong to forgive people and build and be good.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  And it's just driving me so hard. I'm trying to figure out how to comply with it, but it's like an urge way stronger than any other urge I've ever had.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  And forgive yourself too. Self-compassion. We've all done bad things in our lives. We've all made mistakes.
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  Apologize to yourself. Forgive yourself. Be thankful to yourself. And love yourself. Ho aponapono.
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  Sacred Hawaiian healing ritual. You can repeat that mantra to yourself and you can repeat it to others.
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  And it's fantastic in healing and creating love and connection.
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  Ho aponapono. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. I'm thankful. I love you.
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  That's beautiful. Say it again.
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  Ho aponapono. I love that.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  I'm sorry. Please forgive me. I'll say this to Justin. I'm sorry for speaking out, for causing any harm to you and the path that you were on.
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  Please forgive me. I'm doing my absolute best. I'm so thankful to you for everything that you've taught me, for being an inspiration to so many people in the world.
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  And I truly love you from the bottom of my heart. I love you with all my heart. I love you.
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  And I'm doing this for you. I'm just doing this because I feel like I must do this.
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  And nobody's forcing me to do any of this. I hold no oaths except to my wife. My incredible wife, Brittany, is a divine angel in my life.
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  And then the other thing that I would recommend to everybody is read the four agreements, especially as we move forward.
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  Be impeccable with your words. Don't make too many assumptions. Don't take things personally and always do your best.
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  It's a short book. It's a powerful read. Ancient Toltec wisdom.
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  And that will help you on realizing love and freedom and our greatest potential.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  Alex, thank you so much, brother. I appreciate you.
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  I can't say enough. And as you're going into this next thing, recognize that you are a seed and that you plant, you have this vision, and you will manifest the vision.
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  So it's really important, I would say, that we really focus on creating, understanding the challenges that we have, but also pushing towards positive action.
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  And you do that so much. Just watching this whole site, the breaks, bless you, brother. Thank you so much.
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  Well, thank you, Kyle, and we really appreciate you. And I mean, I see success in Canada. I see this backfiring.
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  I think the globalists have awakened Canada. What do you say?
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  I believe so as well. And if you're in Canada, you know, rally together with your people, connect with your communities.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  If you're feeling disconnected, connect. You know, provide the invitation to connect with others.
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  If you're in Ottawa, downtown, invite others to come join through love, through unity, through higher vibrations.
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  And through exposing what's happening that keeps them attacking. Kyle Kemper, thank you so much.
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:05:19.000]  We'll be back with your phone calls straight ahead, infowards.com.
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:29.000]  Welcome to the National Center for Humanism and Nightmare Vision, suppressing the voices of good people all around the world
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lies, their COVID hysteria, their world's gonna end in 2030.
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:45.000]  Carbon tax, global warming, bull, all of it. And none of it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out
[2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  unless everybody is silenced and gas lit. And that's why truth comes with hard work, and with research and with diligence
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:55.840]  And that's why it's hard to share him Fall Wars links and band up with the olyx.
[2:05:55.840 --> 2:05:58.080]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[2:06:03.840 --> 2:06:08.800]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:15.760 --> 2:06:19.680]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center,
[2:06:19.680 --> 2:06:22.240]  and the heart of the resistance.
[2:06:26.480 --> 2:06:29.920]  I want listeners to understand something. The fact that I look old and exhausted,
[2:06:30.640 --> 2:06:37.120]  he's not a sign of weakness, he's a sign of strength. I am literally forcing my will against
[2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:41.520]  the enemy, and that is not physically good for anybody, but that's what men are supposed to do,
[2:06:41.520 --> 2:06:45.360]  and I don't mean that as a bunch of mumbo-jumbo, it's true. I am putting my will against them
[2:06:45.360 --> 2:06:55.760]  constantly, and my strength, and my honor, and my courage is constant, but that is something
[2:06:55.760 --> 2:06:59.600]  most people can't do even a little bit. I do it constantly, and it's very destructive,
[2:07:00.320 --> 2:07:04.320]  but it doesn't matter. My spirit is eternal, and it's becoming stronger the whole time the
[2:07:04.320 --> 2:07:10.560]  body becomes weaker. So pray for me, we can stay in attack formation against the globalist.
[2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:15.520]  Okay, look, I got like 20 plus incredible clips I haven't gotten to right here.
[2:07:17.840 --> 2:07:20.880]  Biden just went and gave a speech in Cold Pepper, Virginia, and said,
[2:07:20.880 --> 2:07:23.920]  I'm the devil, basically. We're going to play that in a moment.
[2:07:26.400 --> 2:07:30.640]  We've got so much here today, and then I'm going to give the phone number out
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:33.120]  at the end of this segment.
[2:07:33.120 --> 2:07:40.880]  But right now, let's play a short clip, and I'll come back and comment on it.
[2:07:45.680 --> 2:07:49.600]  I think what annoys me most about white people is when they pretend like they're the victim.
[2:07:53.600 --> 2:07:55.920]  What's also annoying is when they, you know, when they kill us.
[2:07:57.200 --> 2:08:01.280]  What is fragile about whiteness when everything has been constructed around it?
[2:08:01.280 --> 2:08:06.000]  Every part of who I am has been distorted or criminalized.
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:08.400]  It's really just a bunch of white lies.
[2:08:10.560 --> 2:08:14.800]  You're starting the capitol. You're not patriots. You're ridiculous.
[2:08:16.800 --> 2:08:21.920]  One of the definitions of American whiteness is ignorance.
[2:08:23.600 --> 2:08:27.360]  White people, we are not your problem. You are.
[2:08:27.360 --> 2:08:31.840]  Should white people today feel any responsibility for slavery?
[2:08:31.840 --> 2:08:35.440]  Hell, yeah. White Jesus or black Jesus?
[2:08:35.440 --> 2:08:36.320]  Jesus was not white.
[2:08:37.040 --> 2:08:41.440]  Of geography. Ain't no way Jesus walked around with blonde hair and blue eyes.
[2:08:43.040 --> 2:08:44.960]  White culture fears the end of the world.
[2:08:44.960 --> 2:08:49.040]  For us as Native people, the end of the world already happened like multiple times.
[2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:55.920]  Symbols and monuments, these are mementos of racism.
[2:08:55.920 --> 2:08:57.760]  Bring that stuff to that.
[2:08:57.760 --> 2:09:01.360]  What about TCU BY yogurt or something? Everybody can get behind.
[2:09:03.520 --> 2:09:05.520]  The truth has to be told about history.
[2:09:09.760 --> 2:09:13.360]  We have to make sure that these stories are told from our perspective.
[2:09:14.960 --> 2:09:16.960]  There's always hope. You know what I'm saying? We don't give up.
[2:09:16.960 --> 2:09:21.120]  It's about obliterating systemic and institutionalized racism.
[2:09:21.120 --> 2:09:27.040]  This is a wild place, y'all. It's a wild place.
[2:09:27.040 --> 2:09:31.040]  I know Harriet and Frederick be up there just like, what is they going to do?
[2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:39.280]  All right, so I'm not a huge consumer on mainstream media,
[2:09:39.280 --> 2:09:42.080]  but I scan the internet. I flip the TV channels.
[2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:47.200]  And I want to just randomly at my house sometime with a camera crew set up a camera
[2:09:47.200 --> 2:09:49.760]  and then watch TV for two hours, flip around channels because
[2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:54.480]  about 80% of corporate spokespersons are black now.
[2:09:55.040 --> 2:09:57.120]  It's the same thing in Europe, Asia, everywhere.
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:04.880]  And that is coming from a place of the globalist putting on blackface.
[2:10:06.240 --> 2:10:12.800]  And the blackface they're putting on is about hiding their globalist corporate tyranny
[2:10:12.800 --> 2:10:16.720]  by first saying black people are victims and then white people are bad.
[2:10:16.720 --> 2:10:22.480]  And now the corporations speak for the black people to give them reparations,
[2:10:23.680 --> 2:10:29.200]  but really it's attaching the globalist agenda on to the name of black people.
[2:10:30.480 --> 2:10:36.000]  It's absolute complete and total hijacking of a group of people. It's ridiculous.
[2:10:36.720 --> 2:10:41.760]  I mean, we're going to give $30 million of crack pipes to blacks. That's real.
[2:10:41.760 --> 2:10:46.880]  And the behavioral psychologists are coming up with things that sound insane to train you to accept
[2:10:46.880 --> 2:10:52.960]  the insane because they're getting ready to totally devalue your money, give you only power part of
[2:10:52.960 --> 2:11:01.360]  the day, forcibly inject you. I mean, it's already here. And so they've got to normalize all of this
[2:11:01.360 --> 2:11:08.240]  insanity. It's the only way they can succeed. And I sit there and I've been around.
[2:11:08.240 --> 2:11:13.600]  At big podcasts and big shows behind the scenes, some of the biggest black podcasters and some of
[2:11:13.600 --> 2:11:21.360]  the biggest black music people and they literally like, oh, some of us said it on TV. They've said
[2:11:21.360 --> 2:11:27.680]  it online. Alex Jones is just jealous of this show saying white people are evil because he's mad
[2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:32.800]  that black people are the dominant thing in the media. I'm like, what, real black people? I'd
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:36.400]  be fine with real black people get elected to Congress or, you know, black people are the
[2:11:36.400 --> 2:11:40.960]  real black people get elected to Congress or owning companies or having popular shows. They're sure
[2:11:40.960 --> 2:11:45.280]  a lot of black folks deserve to be the host of things and successful. I'm not debating that.
[2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:48.640]  You know, Jimi Hendrix playing the guitar, Dr.
[2:11:51.120 --> 2:11:56.800]  the head of the Trump medical operation, Ben Carson. That's not what we're talking about.
[2:11:56.800 --> 2:12:06.000]  We're talking about the corporate system. Why do I turn my TV on and I'm like four ads in a row?
[2:12:07.760 --> 2:12:11.440]  My daughter wanted to know about the Loch Ness Monster four years old. So I said,
[2:12:11.440 --> 2:12:16.560]  let me look in the TV guide and I found the history channel or one of those channels
[2:12:16.560 --> 2:12:20.400]  was one of those channels. And it was about the Loch Ness Monster. So I hit the hour long program
[2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:25.760]  and like it was like five minutes a show, four minutes ads, biggest amount of ads I ever saw
[2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:35.840]  like 20 some minutes ads an hour. And every ad was nothing but black people. And it wasn't black
[2:12:35.840 --> 2:12:44.880]  people are watching Loch Ness Monster shows. It's that it's that every ad is that so that when
[2:12:44.880 --> 2:12:49.440]  you're watching it, you're taught you're white, you're guilty, you're evil, you've done wrong.
[2:12:49.440 --> 2:12:53.120]  And look, the black people are selling you insurance and look, the black people are
[2:12:53.120 --> 2:12:59.120]  and then showtime and the big mega corporations and all these channels and all the comedians
[2:12:59.120 --> 2:13:04.960]  are white people are evil and America's racist and America sucks. And now NPR says using the
[2:13:04.960 --> 2:13:12.880]  wrong color emoji is racist. They're just sabotaging humanity with divide and conquer.
[2:13:12.880 --> 2:13:19.680]  And I know this audience totally gets that. I know this audience is completely
[2:13:19.680 --> 2:13:27.520]  totally and totally aware of that. But at a certain point, it just makes my head spin
[2:13:28.480 --> 2:13:33.280]  how ridiculous this is all gotten. And imagine white people
[2:13:35.520 --> 2:13:39.680]  are going to do one of three things watching shows like this that are on everywhere. You can't
[2:13:39.680 --> 2:13:44.160]  escape it. They're going to say I'll submit wherever the left says I'm not a bad person.
[2:13:44.160 --> 2:13:48.960]  I will see the left is my high priest. I will do whatever they say so that I will no longer be
[2:13:48.960 --> 2:13:55.440]  impure and bad. And of course, that's not to help black people. That's to get you under the corporate
[2:13:55.440 --> 2:14:02.640]  control and occult doing what they say. Or you're going to become super anti black and actually
[2:14:02.640 --> 2:14:06.480]  think the black people have taken everything over and are out to get you and now you're going to
[2:14:06.480 --> 2:14:14.080]  do them but hate black people. Or you're going to become depressed and just punch out a society
[2:14:14.080 --> 2:14:20.960]  and commit suicide or drink yourself to death and just go away. Which is what it's by the way,
[2:14:21.520 --> 2:14:26.720]  this kind of stuff, they've got studies and numbers out on it. Black people in major studies
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:33.200]  are rejecting race politics and white shouldn't be able to have the same rights and numbers
[2:14:33.200 --> 2:14:37.440]  double what any other group are. Black people twice the number of any other group don't want to
[2:14:37.440 --> 2:14:41.440]  take the shots twice the number any other group don't believe all this propaganda that white
[2:14:41.440 --> 2:14:47.280]  people are the devil. So the left and these white scientists, they are mainly white,
[2:14:47.280 --> 2:14:51.840]  these social engineers, these social constructors, these behavioral psychologists,
[2:14:51.840 --> 2:14:56.000]  they're all trying to divide people but the black folks on average see through it.
[2:14:56.720 --> 2:15:01.360]  So the actual black people see through this and reject it and don't believe it.
[2:15:01.360 --> 2:15:11.600]  But you know who does believe it, white women, 70% roughly, absolutely believe every damn thing
[2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:18.800]  they're told. Put a mask on your kid, take five shots, communism's good, white men are bad.
[2:15:18.800 --> 2:15:24.960]  If you imagine this, 70% of white women believe whatever they're told.
[2:15:24.960 --> 2:15:35.360]  And it's like 50% of black women by it too. About 30% of white men, about 20% of black men and women
[2:15:35.360 --> 2:15:42.720]  by this. Depending on which study year number you look at, those are all just stult numbers.
[2:15:43.360 --> 2:15:47.920]  I mean, this is just insane, ladies and gentlemen. This is cold blooded social engineering,
[2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:52.640]  cold blooded divide and conquer, cold blooded turn us against each other.
[2:15:52.640 --> 2:15:54.880]  All the big mega corporations robbed the hell out of us.
[2:15:58.800 --> 2:16:05.360]  Something very rare is going on and it ends in just three days. As of the time,
[2:16:05.360 --> 2:16:11.040]  I'm taping this announcement on Thursday afternoon. Coming up this Monday, the biggest
[2:16:11.040 --> 2:16:16.800]  sale in four years of high-quality, affordable foods and for Parallax.com,
[2:16:16.800 --> 2:16:22.800]  will end. That's 25% off. Already the lowest prices are going to find a high-quality, affordable
[2:16:22.800 --> 2:16:31.280]  food at infowarstore.com. Again, you can go to prepare with Alex.com or infowarstore.com
[2:16:31.280 --> 2:16:40.480]  and it takes you to the same place. 50% off as well from super high-quality products like X3,
[2:16:40.480 --> 2:16:46.640]  the deep earth, there's still iodine. That sale is going on as well. It doesn't end on Monday,
[2:16:46.640 --> 2:16:50.640]  it'll end in a few weeks and we're almost sold out of the product. Everybody needs to have
[2:16:50.640 --> 2:16:55.360]  horrible food, be prepared, to become self-sufficient now, the best high-quality food at the lowest
[2:16:55.360 --> 2:17:04.000]  prices at infowarstore.com. Come to command here with an important message to humanity.
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:11.440]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe,
[2:17:12.160 --> 2:17:22.720]  but the injection is not ready yet. And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days
[2:17:22.720 --> 2:17:30.400]  to flatten the cans. I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop
[2:17:30.400 --> 2:17:39.440]  at mega corporations. That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving
[2:17:39.440 --> 2:17:48.240]  companies that only I own profitable. You will then be my slaves. Oh, and then you'll get that
[2:17:48.240 --> 2:17:54.880]  special shot of freedom from copra. It will remove your immune system so you'll be dependent on me
[2:17:54.880 --> 2:18:02.560]  for the rest of your miserable lives. It's time to protect your privacy. It's time to come to grips

[2:19:05.680 --> 2:19:10.480]  the communists. Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[2:19:10.480 --> 2:19:15.280]  above organic in the volcanic soil better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy it from the
[2:19:15.280 --> 2:19:18.800]  little farmers that you know the media calls communists but really they're just a commune
[2:19:18.800 --> 2:19:22.720]  and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't
[2:19:22.720 --> 2:19:26.080]  let the Mexican government take over so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been
[2:19:26.080 --> 2:19:29.840]  buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up. The same stuff sold at Whole Foods
[2:19:29.840 --> 2:19:34.240]  under another name for about 50% more for pound and I just think it's some of the best coffee
[2:19:34.240 --> 2:19:38.880]  you're gonna find anywhere. It's wake up america, patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally.
[2:19:38.880 --> 2:19:46.400]  Um in fact I'm not gonna tell you a little story. Um we had like that. I'm sure you wouldn't

[2:21:34.160 --> 2:21:39.120]  I said I'd do one last Saturday and then stuff came up but I'm gonna put these in. I normally
[2:21:39.120 --> 2:21:42.640]  show up when I say I am for a special show but this Saturday I forgot I had a bunch of stuff
[2:21:42.640 --> 2:21:47.920]  I had to take care of. I'm busier than a one-legged man as they know in an ass kicking contest
[2:21:47.920 --> 2:21:52.240]  but I do want to give the number out for whatever you want to cover whatever you want to get into

[2:22:11.600 --> 2:22:17.360]  All right you know I'm aware of psychology because I live it. I mean everything I tell you
[2:22:17.360 --> 2:22:24.560]  I got the same problems you got so as we all know what we should do versus what we do
[2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:29.840]  is two different enchiladas so when I'm bossing you around I'm not bossing around I'm putting
[2:22:29.840 --> 2:22:34.960]  suggestions out to all of us and here's where I really dropped the ball and I knew this was
[2:22:34.960 --> 2:22:40.000]  happening I said this over a year ago when it started there's gonna get a point because that's
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:48.080]  how we're designed that there's so many soccer players and football players and baseball players
[2:22:48.080 --> 2:22:52.560]  and little kids and old people and everybody else dying from these deadly shots that they knew in
[2:22:52.560 --> 2:22:57.360]  their own documents in October 2020 and the CDC would cause heart attacks myocarditis and blood
[2:22:57.360 --> 2:23:03.840]  clots and all the rest of it that we will get to a point where we don't even care anymore and I'm
[2:23:03.840 --> 2:23:08.480]  going to be honest with you I'm strong enough minded to fight the globalist and the great reset
[2:23:08.480 --> 2:23:14.160]  the new world order and the pedophile rings but I could not handle all this death in my brain
[2:23:14.160 --> 2:23:20.480]  didn't just get to where it doesn't care so my soul cares but it's looking through the rose
[2:23:20.480 --> 2:23:26.160]  color darkly in my brain and I'm just like okay yeah I got like six seven articles today about
[2:23:26.160 --> 2:23:31.120]  little kids dying from shots I don't really don't want to watch this video I don't want to talk about
[2:23:31.120 --> 2:23:39.360]  this dead kid not because I don't care about this little kid it's the opposite but you know what
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:47.440]  it's not my body running this show it's my spirit and my spirit says get in there and cover this
[2:23:47.440 --> 2:23:55.840]  right now so here it is I mean you can go watch the videos about these kids here about them who
[2:23:55.840 --> 2:24:01.760]  they were and who their parents are then I feel incredibly guilty that we couldn't stop this you
[2:24:01.760 --> 2:24:09.200]  know I mean this is just one of the articles I saw at least six in the stack folks and you know
[2:24:09.200 --> 2:24:14.960]  we hear about one out of a hundred right that these but Fauci does he care oh he's smiling
[2:24:14.960 --> 2:24:21.680]  like a pig and you know what oh it's so funny he's like a dog in a butcher shop oh it's so cute
[2:24:21.680 --> 2:24:31.440]  oh it's so much fun to not have a soul I guess but it's not not normal is the headline on
[2:24:31.440 --> 2:24:39.280]  info wars.com by Kelly McBreen two high school baseball players collapse midgame and die on the
[2:24:39.280 --> 2:24:48.080]  same day see now when all these people are dying I don't even cover it but oh it's two on the same
[2:24:48.080 --> 2:24:53.760]  day well then we gotta cover it and as the deaths mount we just get normal we just normalize it which
[2:24:53.760 --> 2:24:59.360]  is the globalist one they know we're just gonna get used to it and no no I will not adapt to this
[2:24:59.360 --> 2:25:04.560]  I will not accept this I will not become numb to this I will not be part of this you're like well
[2:25:04.560 --> 2:25:12.640]  Jones you didn't kill these kids yeah I did and so did you sure we're not as guilty as some
[2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:18.240]  and as FIFA Vendetta says they will be held accountable but yeah you look at the mirror
[2:25:18.240 --> 2:25:23.440]  well I'm guilty for this and I don't I'm not a hate me hit myself person but you know what my
[2:25:23.440 --> 2:25:31.120]  soul tells me I haven't done enough because I haven't done enough damn it and some jackass
[2:25:31.120 --> 2:25:34.960]  Baptist out there I'm not attacking Baptist but you know what I mean oh you shouldn't say damn

[2:25:46.400 --> 2:25:54.640]  players collapse mid game and die on the same day is this the new normal we have to get used to
[2:25:54.640 --> 2:26:01.360]  and now there's articles and spillboards and signs on buses oh heart attacks are really normal now
[2:26:01.360 --> 2:26:07.920]  they're they're way up because the stress from the lockdown yeah right a pair of teenagers from
[2:26:07.920 --> 2:26:12.240]  different states both collapse and died during their high school basketball games on Tuesday
[2:26:12.240 --> 2:26:15.280]  that would normally happen maybe once every three or four years would be a huge story
[2:26:17.440 --> 2:26:21.680]  Texas sophomore I remember I was like 10 years old at some I forget his name

[2:28:19.600 --> 2:28:25.760]  wanted to do to us and the fact that we sit here we let him do this to us we are worse than Bill Gates
[2:28:25.760 --> 2:28:32.960]  we killed those children we let that murdering sack of filth do whatever he wants because we
[2:28:32.960 --> 2:28:38.800]  were too weak minded to admit it and he believes we won't stop him he believes we're gonna bow to
[2:28:38.800 --> 2:28:47.360]  him forever but he will be broken he will be destroyed by the will of God for what he's done

[2:34:07.680 --> 2:34:12.960]  in and um talked about the white paper called secure in the net from the brookens institute
[2:34:12.960 --> 2:34:19.360]  written in um 2013 and that white paper is called secure in the net global governments
[2:34:20.400 --> 2:34:26.080]  in the digital domain 2022 and in that white paper i have it all documented if you don't
[2:34:26.080 --> 2:34:33.440]  mind me giving a plug to my blog um the good fight news dot com it's all there everything's sourced
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:41.600]  and it basically says in one of their scenarios conflict with us in china is going to lead to
[2:34:41.600 --> 2:34:47.440]  the collapse of e-commerce and then um this all dovetail says exactly what you're saying
[2:34:48.160 --> 2:34:53.360]  how do we know this is not prophecy this is something that they plan and they war game
[2:34:53.920 --> 2:35:00.720]  over and over again so we're going to see more things like the colonial pipeline start to happen
[2:35:01.360 --> 2:35:06.240]  and it's going to be shutdowns lockdowns we might see like a few day blackout on the internet
[2:35:06.240 --> 2:35:13.600]  and i'm pretty sure they're going to position that with what's going on in ukraine now that's
[2:35:13.600 --> 2:35:20.320]  right they've they've run their virus hoax fear until it ran out and woke people up and is now
[2:35:20.320 --> 2:35:24.720]  a negative so now they're backing off in words only but now they're going to launch the cyber
[2:35:24.720 --> 2:35:34.960]  attacks uh the wars all of that is here yes uh yes so in 2021 as well we also saw the um
[2:35:34.960 --> 2:35:41.520]  a meat processor get hacked um we're going to see blockchain and cryptocurrency wallets
[2:35:42.320 --> 2:35:48.080]  starts to shut down because they have to reign in that and bring in their digital currency which
[2:35:48.080 --> 2:35:54.560]  is all going to be which is all going to be under one protocol now by the way i meant to lead the
[2:35:54.560 --> 2:36:00.960]  show with that today um the the the same atlantic council that's the mouthpiece of this thing the
[2:36:00.960 --> 2:36:04.880]  same guy that called for the arrest of anybody that questions lock downs uh with the head of
[2:36:04.880 --> 2:36:09.280]  feiser they said oh the global government it's about to be here and the global currency is
[2:36:09.280 --> 2:36:14.480]  about to be here so you're absolutely right they're they're getting all that ready yeah so let me
[2:36:14.480 --> 2:36:20.800]  quote something from that brookens institute document from 2013 it says an incubation period
[2:36:20.800 --> 2:36:27.200]  during which a steadily growing dino american which is china american tensions um led to an
[2:36:27.200 --> 2:36:33.360]  outbreak phase of cyber crime which led to a collapse of e-commerce and forced the governments
[2:36:34.080 --> 2:36:40.240]  overwhelmed by the volume with the number of crimes to come together um finally the passing
[2:36:40.240 --> 2:36:46.160]  phase of the old internet internet is initiated by russia china and germany following a global
[2:36:46.720 --> 2:36:52.320]  panic during a brief period of cyber terror these are all quoted i have it all linked up
[2:36:52.320 --> 2:36:59.920]  document you're right and then and then swab is on tv drooling saying we will take over and save
[2:36:59.920 --> 2:37:08.400]  the earth because of cyber time and and that's the plan so the next lockdowns will be internet
[2:37:08.400 --> 2:37:13.440]  lockdowns and ever since i called you in december you've really been hitting that so i appreciate
[2:37:13.440 --> 2:37:18.720]  you for no you're right and then when people don't have food they'll say sign on to a carbon score
[2:37:18.720 --> 2:37:22.480]  we'll deliver you food but now you've got to agree to be tracked to control by us forever
[2:37:22.480 --> 2:37:28.720]  and now you're a broken slave thank you josh yeah we're here folks we can stop it together though
[2:37:29.520 --> 2:37:33.120]  let's go ahead take another call john in nebraska you're on the air welcome john

[2:39:24.720 --> 2:39:33.520]  hey alex how's it going i just wanted to uh to let you know that you guys have a kind of a jacked up
[2:39:33.520 --> 2:39:40.080]  headline says uh i'm info wars dot com not normal exclamation point to high school basketball players
[2:39:40.080 --> 2:39:47.680]  collapse mid game and die on same day but then buried in the uh the text of the article it says
[2:39:47.680 --> 2:39:55.040]  the team's vaccination statuses are unknown quote in autopsy reports have yet to be released
[2:39:55.040 --> 2:40:02.160]  i fail to see how this is even a story when when you're you're saying you have absolutely no idea
[2:40:02.720 --> 2:40:08.000]  why these kids died and then we all it's obviously a tragedy and we all accept that let me just be
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:12.560]  clear i just read the headline and some of the article i'll check it so so you're saying there
[2:40:12.560 --> 2:40:18.320]  isn't a 500 increase in sports people have an heart attack and there's not advisories on the
[2:40:18.320 --> 2:40:23.600]  modern and Pfizer shot now saying they can cause heart attacks and myocarditis are you saying
[2:40:23.600 --> 2:40:29.280]  that's just totally made up is that what you're saying saying is that myocarditis is actually
[2:40:29.280 --> 2:40:34.560]  often caused by the virus itself not the vaccination yeah well i've actually had medical doctors
[2:40:34.560 --> 2:40:40.640]  on like dr peter mccullough and others and they say there's actually a name now uh specifically
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:47.280]  for a vaccine induced myocarditis so the insurance company owners about a 40 increase
[2:40:47.280 --> 2:40:54.720]  in death is that made up to well i'm saying there's actually a name for headlines like this one which
[2:40:54.720 --> 2:40:59.120]  is called listen i appreciate listen i appreciate your call i will look into that sir but i know
[2:40:59.120 --> 2:41:05.600]  seminar calls when i hear them okay on agenda hey listen listen you're right lockdowns are good
[2:41:05.600 --> 2:41:11.200]  good masker good claus Schwab's good these vaccines really work well gene therapies
[2:41:12.080 --> 2:41:16.000]  we don't have all the scientists warning their problems we don't have you know the people that
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:20.400]  worked at these actual companies saying they're bad you're right everything's fine sir all right
[2:41:20.400 --> 2:41:24.400]  we're gonna move quick to the calls ray in arkansas you're on the air welcome ray
[2:41:26.320 --> 2:41:31.920]  uh hey what's up man welcome brother go ahead uh i just wanted to ask you i wanted to mention
[2:41:31.920 --> 2:41:37.920]  two things to you man uh in oco arkansas here in mississippi carney arkansas uh whenever you go to
[2:41:37.920 --> 2:41:44.080]  court uh anything you go to court for uh they're immediately offering you as you stand in front
[2:41:44.080 --> 2:41:48.640]  of the judge they're offering up to 200 dollars off of your fine uh just to get the vaccine and i
[2:41:48.640 --> 2:41:53.760]  just feel like that's kind of targeting poor people oh it's super creepy well i mean it's not a
[2:41:53.760 --> 2:41:58.720]  vaccine it's a gene therapy linked to infertility heart attacks and blood clots that's on the insert
[2:41:58.720 --> 2:42:04.640]  the last caller could try to obfuscate about that but it's on the insert yeah and another thing is
[2:42:04.640 --> 2:42:10.640]  it's just whenever the judicial system is also pushing around people who are um who can't afford
[2:42:10.640 --> 2:42:15.040]  to pay their fines and you know they're giving out a free vaccine form to get 200 knocked off and
[2:42:15.040 --> 2:42:20.000]  oftentimes 200 dollars may be the difference in going to jail or not so countless people are
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:25.360]  getting the vaccine uh just for the well again and again i hear you calling a vaccine i do too
[2:42:25.360 --> 2:42:31.680]  they're not vaccines they're gene therapies and in the year of the vaccine we had way more death
[2:42:31.680 --> 2:42:36.640]  than the year before the vaccine what do you make of that well
[2:42:40.320 --> 2:42:45.040]  yeah hey i'm sorry what was that again i thought you broke out on ray i appreciate your call god

[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:40.000]  this earth was satan but satan was defeated and thrown down and broken of old and only set about
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:45.360]  in the office by god as the tester of the children of god and the faithful
[2:47:45.360 --> 2:47:55.680]  so that is his office our office is the stars should we decide to take that birthright on
[2:47:56.720 --> 2:47:58.240]  and begin the transcendence
[2:48:01.760 --> 2:48:05.040]  the children of satan believe only once they've exterminated

[2:49:36.080 --> 2:49:41.200]  mean that that is just beautiful what what's on your mind Jeremiah and that's the beauty of what's
[2:49:41.200 --> 2:49:46.880]  happening is human consciousness like you talk about in reset wars is rising so exponentially
[2:49:46.880 --> 2:49:51.440]  they cannot keep up right i wanted to talk to you about bill gates i was up in san francisco
[2:49:51.440 --> 2:49:56.400]  last week for an interview i'm a tech recruiter they're building chips alex that are trying to
[2:49:56.400 --> 2:50:02.160]  break more's law he was putting tons it's billion dollar chip war intel just invested
[2:50:02.160 --> 2:50:08.960]  20 billion into a site here in the u.s huge chip wars to really advance this technology to upload
[2:50:08.960 --> 2:50:14.000]  our consciousness and i think the more younger people can understand this naturally they're
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:20.160]  going to reject it well explain what more's law is and what they're trying to do more's law
[2:50:20.160 --> 2:50:27.760]  essentially says that technology chip power memory ram processing speed it doubles every two years
[2:50:27.760 --> 2:50:32.560]  this is a law that's been around since intel created the first chip back in the 60s this is
[2:50:32.560 --> 2:50:39.440]  what they have to break in order to take everything to that next level and have they done it
[2:50:41.200 --> 2:50:46.000]  they basically they explained it to me they said they've got the car ready to go they have
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:50.960]  the keys and the ignition but they basically have to work out all the kink this was the analogy they
[2:50:50.960 --> 2:50:55.600]  gave me uh a lot of different companies a lot of different start well yeah that's the atlantic
[2:50:55.600 --> 2:51:03.200]  and moment is when it's so sophisticated no one can control it exactly and this is what they want
[2:51:03.200 --> 2:51:08.880]  because we're cheap we're useless we're just bottom feeders to them but i think canada has
[2:51:08.880 --> 2:51:13.520]  proven that that's not the case well also we make the decision about our own environment
[2:51:13.520 --> 2:51:18.000]  we don't have to deploy things that make us obsolete we don't have to stop farming ourselves
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:22.720]  we don't have to have robots do it while we watch netflix we have to decide no we want
[2:51:22.720 --> 2:51:28.160]  a pro human future and we want to incrementally to use the frank herbert parallel bring in
[2:51:28.160 --> 2:51:34.080]  technology selectively where it doesn't enslave us but it empowers us where it serves us it's that
[2:51:34.960 --> 2:51:41.040]  decision and that divine spark of creation that allows us to control it but the behavioral
[2:51:41.040 --> 2:51:46.720]  psychologists the left says your animals you have no free will just give way to our machines screw them
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:54.000]  exactly exactly god is on our side the truth always prevails it's darkest before the dawn and
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:59.040]  hey jeremiah was a prophet i'm just saying god bless you jeremiah i'm gonna get you on hold i want
[2:51:59.040 --> 2:52:02.480]  to talk to you about the neck point test thing and you can help us with it stuff because we have

[2:52:28.240 --> 2:52:32.560]  to say you know we kind of need to move toward a unified field theory as they move away from these
[2:52:32.560 --> 2:52:38.800]  restrictions as to what was actually um you know deployed on on the public and i've talked to you
[2:52:38.800 --> 2:52:43.840]  several times i don't know if you remember me i talked in september um about some of the graphene
[2:52:43.840 --> 2:52:48.000]  oxide aspect of it no i didn't remember you're calling you're right we need to not be oh they're
[2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:52.160]  getting off our back we need to be how do we bring them to justice so they don't launch the next attack
[2:52:53.040 --> 2:53:00.560]  yeah precisely and i want to state this emphatically okay um nuremberg was a failure okay the people the
[2:53:00.560 --> 2:53:07.040]  actual culprits got away out 32 000 nazis were brought here and got away well that too but all
[2:53:07.040 --> 2:53:12.960]  the heads of ig farben the people that paid to build the damn camps and have you're right all
[2:53:12.960 --> 2:53:18.800]  the corporate leaders that made the money in iran and they all got scott free yes a slap on the
[2:53:18.800 --> 2:53:23.280]  wrist they they spent like a year in a villa outside of berlin and then they all became heads
[2:53:23.280 --> 2:53:28.400]  of major corporations in in the new marshal play in europe which was something that they were able
[2:53:28.400 --> 2:53:34.320]  to do because hitler rewrote that entire continent due to that war now and people have to understand
[2:53:34.320 --> 2:53:39.760]  this too joseph megalov was taking orders from bare pharmaceuticals and the adl is complicit
[2:53:39.760 --> 2:53:44.080]  in covering up that these were ridiculous experiments that no one knows why they were doing
[2:53:44.080 --> 2:53:49.120]  them now you're right and the nazis had networks to control europe the united states took that over
[2:53:49.120 --> 2:53:55.440]  and kept those networks in place on record and that's the e u today was a nazi blueprint correct
[2:53:55.440 --> 2:54:00.000]  and there was a big transfer of uranium to with elements of the nazis that led to the first
[2:54:00.000 --> 2:54:03.360]  trinity bomb because they didn't have the amount of uranium they needed to make the
[2:54:03.360 --> 2:54:08.560]  property that you know that the sonium and so forth so that this is all chronicled and you
[2:54:08.560 --> 2:54:13.200]  can even go see it on on wikipedia because people don't understand now you're right what's crazy
[2:54:13.200 --> 2:54:19.520]  is it's all on record people think like we're saying this it's all on record it is and even
[2:54:19.520 --> 2:54:22.960]  the power that be will leave it there because they think we're too stupid and you say that all
[2:54:22.960 --> 2:54:28.640]  the time quite notably and so i just want to say nuremberg was a failure so whatever happens next
[2:54:28.640 --> 2:54:34.160]  they got to go down this time alex okay and i just want to say that the unified field theory on
[2:54:34.160 --> 2:54:39.760]  these vaccines starts with that spike protein i wanted to say that right before this whole
[2:54:39.760 --> 2:54:46.640]  thing was unleashed in around 2016 2015 they were able to crack the code on signaling proteins
[2:54:46.640 --> 2:54:52.160]  of which the spike protein is okay and it's very important people understand that and within a few
[2:54:52.160 --> 2:54:57.680]  years of them getting it they patent the spike protein of hiv and they hit us with it and they
[2:54:57.680 --> 2:55:01.840]  admit now that they are causing giant autoimmune disorders they're giving everybody aids right
[2:55:01.840 --> 2:55:06.320]  now and but that's and this could be an aspect of this and i'll leave you with this because
[2:55:06.320 --> 2:55:09.840]  they're going to move on but that technology that they're putting in people that everybody
[2:55:09.840 --> 2:55:13.920]  knows the inter corporal body network okay that the fifth column and everybody been talking about
[2:55:13.920 --> 2:55:18.720]  yeah two peters and all right okay they need to have that exist in the body and they need
[2:55:18.720 --> 2:55:24.640]  to have to have autoimmune suppressants so that stuff can exist right in the body so they can
[2:55:24.640 --> 2:55:29.680]  actually work between the cell signaling pathways and that autoimmune response they're able to put
[2:55:29.680 --> 2:55:33.520]  what they need to to get that technology up and running that's why they're not so worried now
[2:55:33.520 --> 2:55:38.160]  because whatever comes next the people that took this will be susceptible that lived so they've
[2:55:38.160 --> 2:55:43.120]  already got enough people to test on and slowly kill and rob and uses their test subjects yes
[2:55:43.120 --> 2:55:48.720]  that's why they launched it they even have it in the spars document that that the world would wake
[2:55:48.720 --> 2:55:55.040]  up and they back off phase one you're absolutely right all right thank you mike and chris we're

[2:58:07.680 --> 2:58:13.040]  trying to collapse our society to build on tashes their their transhumanist nightmare vision
[2:58:13.760 --> 2:58:19.680]  suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and
[2:58:19.680 --> 2:58:26.720]  engineers that are exposing all their lives their covetous stereo their world's gonna end in 2030
[2:58:26.720 --> 2:58:33.520]  carbon tax global warming bull all of it and none of it can succeed none of it can actually be carried
[2:58:33.520 --> 2:58:39.760]  out unless everybody is silenced and gaslit that's why truth comes with hard work and with
[2:58:39.760 --> 2:58:44.720]  research and diligence and that's why it's hard to share info wars links and band of video links
[2:58:44.720 --> 2:58:49.360]  that's why we've got to share them now more than ever with all the craziness going on in the
[2:58:49.360 --> 2:58:55.280]  world with the globalist plotting their next big lockdown for the next phase of the great reset
[2:58:55.280 --> 2:59:02.160]  being a stage cyber attack with the deep state pushing a civil war not just here but in europe
[2:59:02.160 --> 2:59:07.920]  and war with russia with the massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place

[3:00:14.240 --> 3:00:19.680]  atlanta chris you're on the air what's your take on what's happening hey alex thanks for
[3:00:19.680 --> 3:00:24.640]  taking my call there's two things that i wanted to mention to you um at first i wanted to mention
[3:00:24.640 --> 3:00:30.960]  an indeed ad um in case you put on though it's a job listing website anyway there's an ad out
[3:00:30.960 --> 3:00:37.360]  there for role players in dc and it's pretty interesting actually is that it's a company
[3:00:37.360 --> 3:00:43.520]  called c a and m incorporated basically they're looking for role players to enact training
[3:00:43.520 --> 3:00:49.600]  events such as health disaster training law enforcement training etc but the requirements
[3:00:49.600 --> 3:00:54.720]  um it's pretty interesting also at the very end it says they want role players with secret
[3:00:54.720 --> 3:01:01.200]  security clearance retired do d department of state and i sent this link to your uh news tip
[3:01:01.200 --> 3:01:07.680]  as well uh the news tips thank well thanks for calling about that but cnn and and the democrat
[3:01:07.680 --> 3:01:13.040]  lawyers say role players don't exist even though they hired people for charlottesville and hired
[3:01:13.040 --> 3:01:19.360]  people for january 6 and if you talk about it you get sued so i just want to say the state
[3:01:19.360 --> 3:01:24.480]  department's wrong russia couldn't stage a false flag false flags don't exist gulf atonkin was a
[3:01:24.480 --> 3:01:28.320]  stage even though they admit it was northwoods wasn't a real plan even though it's they admit
[3:01:28.320 --> 3:01:33.760]  it's real jessie spallott was really attacked uh bubba wallace did have nooses there were
[3:01:33.760 --> 3:01:40.880]  wmds and iraq there were babies and incubators in 1990 uh and i don't want to get sued so uh i
[3:01:40.880 --> 3:01:47.040]  don't care if there's ads for crisis actors in dc it doesn't exist you understand the democrats
[3:01:47.040 --> 3:01:53.600]  said so say with me do not question official stories just say it with me chris okay got you
[3:01:53.600 --> 3:01:58.960]  let's say do not question the official stories no but very interesting chris that you've engaged
[3:01:58.960 --> 3:02:05.040]  in a hateful white supremacist thing to talk about how let's be serious i went to u n events
[3:02:05.040 --> 3:02:09.920]  like 15 years ago where they would have people on bullhorns with hollywood directors and buses
[3:02:09.920 --> 3:02:16.320]  pulling up of actors being paid $100 a day back then like 200 a day now to literally go we want
[3:02:16.320 --> 3:02:23.200]  to ban meat we want to ban meat and they would hand them the signs so yes so much of this is staged
[3:02:23.200 --> 3:02:28.000]  and they don't want us questioning that that's why they're so pissed so great job pointing this out
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:33.040]  tell us tell us what you discovered in this job posting for crisis actors in dc with security
[3:02:33.040 --> 3:02:38.320]  clearances because obviously the agency doesn't do it a manager group hires their own people so
[3:02:38.320 --> 3:02:43.280]  there's plausible denominability then they have their group go out and you know post their you
[3:02:43.280 --> 3:02:48.880]  know little right wing rage well i found that it's uh it was posted by a company called ca and m
[3:02:48.880 --> 3:02:54.800]  incorporated and i looked it up it's a small company based out of maryland it says it's a stock
[3:02:54.800 --> 3:03:02.320]  company um but yeah so i looked that up and then in the description it says that uh candidate should
[3:03:02.320 --> 3:03:07.840]  be comfortable on schedule you know being scheduled on short notice for a conus event which a conus
[3:03:07.840 --> 3:03:12.960]  stands for outside the continental us but they also call for people to realistically accurately
[3:03:12.960 --> 3:03:19.440]  and convincingly portray your role um you know be able to take directions and uh you know talk to
[3:03:19.440 --> 3:03:23.680]  the media let me just i know you know this obviously someone a smart person this is how
[3:03:23.680 --> 3:03:28.720]  agencies create a corporation as a cutout so they have deniability about whatever it is and
[3:03:28.720 --> 3:03:32.880]  then they're like oh you gotta have top secret security clearances be part of this their own
[3:03:32.880 --> 3:03:38.560]  people are ordered to show up and enroll in this it's a very thin veil yeah i just thought it's
[3:03:38.560 --> 3:03:44.960]  interesting you was posted five days ago you know so if something happened you know might be oh i mean
[3:03:44.960 --> 3:03:51.520]  wait a minute cnn said crisis actors don't exist so why are you engaging in hateful behaviors sir
[3:03:52.560 --> 3:03:59.280]  uh my mistake i'm sorry well we'll get a story about this you know they really mattered us to
[3:03:59.280 --> 3:04:05.520]  talk about their staged events so i'm sure whatever they're planning with people with security clearances
[3:04:05.520 --> 3:04:11.200]  and top level security clearances is totally normal don't you think so chris it's definitely
[3:04:11.200 --> 3:04:16.240]  normal uh the second thing i wanted to mention to you as well um i have an idea to get around
[3:04:16.240 --> 3:04:22.640]  the big tech censorship um i was really involved in ron paul's 2008 campaign as far as like just
[3:04:22.640 --> 3:04:28.480]  diy getting the word out and i think it might be you know effective to take a diy approach
[3:04:28.480 --> 3:04:33.200]  like hang banners you know made a shoot hold on paul watson's taken over but i want to hear what you
[3:04:33.200 --> 3:04:38.000]  have to say so chris and mike are the last callers i promise you guys don't forget because you always

[3:06:19.920 --> 3:06:26.000]  news studios in the united kingdom you are listening to pa joseph watson
[3:06:28.720 --> 3:06:36.000]  be alive it is the summit news hour on this thursday edition got a ton an avalanche of news to cover
[3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:43.040]  as per usual related to what is being signaled as the end of the covin 19 pandemic oh no don't say
[3:06:43.040 --> 3:06:49.680]  that some people are desperate to cling on to their grift which they've desperately clung on to for
[3:06:49.680 --> 3:06:55.840]  the past 24 months but it appears as though at least in europe fouches obviously remiss to accept
[3:06:55.840 --> 3:07:02.240]  that it's happening but it does appear to be coming to an end and every week i come on here and say
[3:07:02.240 --> 3:07:07.040]  there's a bombshell news story that nobody is covering it's not got anywhere near the level
[3:07:07.040 --> 3:07:14.320]  of coverage it deserves in the legacy media and for good reason and yet again we have another story
[3:07:14.320 --> 3:07:20.160]  in that context today headline doctor who discovered omicron variant says she was
[3:07:20.160 --> 3:07:27.520]  pressured to not reveal it was mild now if you were listening to me back in mid december you'll
[3:07:27.520 --> 3:07:31.760]  remember that i was warning people until i was blue in the face that there was no need for extra
[3:07:31.760 --> 3:07:38.720]  lockdown mask rule restrictions to fight omicron because all the data coming out of south africa
[3:07:38.720 --> 3:07:45.120]  which was first hit by the omicron variant which by the way had a vaccinated the esteemed
[3:07:45.120 --> 3:07:51.280]  vaunted covin 19 vaccination had only got to 25 percent of the south african population at that
[3:07:51.280 --> 3:07:58.240]  time and yet the omicron variant in south africa was mild it wasn't causing serious illness it wasn't
[3:07:58.240 --> 3:08:05.680]  causing a rise in death there was one doctor who was at the forefront of pushing the same message
[3:08:05.680 --> 3:08:11.680]  the very discoverer of the omicron variant itself doctor angeli courtsey in south africa
[3:08:12.240 --> 3:08:18.720]  who went on bbc news sky news cnn all these other networks and tried to tell people that europe
[3:08:18.720 --> 3:08:26.160]  was freaking out panicking overreacting same with america in introducing new restrictions by the way
[3:08:26.160 --> 3:08:32.400]  some of which are still in place in scotland you still have to wear a mask everywhere in spain
[3:08:32.400 --> 3:08:40.080]  up until yesterday they were still making people wear masks outside anywhere they walked around
[3:08:40.080 --> 3:08:46.800]  in spain like i was in spain in 2020 when the first wave of coronavirus had completely dipped
[3:08:46.800 --> 3:08:52.240]  and they were still making people wear masks outside then i saw people hiking up mountains
[3:08:52.240 --> 3:08:58.400]  wearing frigging face masks at risk to their own health and safety well now the south african
[3:08:58.400 --> 3:09:04.720]  doctor who first discovered the omicron variant says she was pressured by european governments to
[3:09:04.720 --> 3:09:12.000]  not reveal that it was mild they told her to shut up why is this not the biggest story in the media
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:18.240]  today it should be she made the bombshell revelation during an interview with germanese veld newspaper
[3:09:18.880 --> 3:09:24.960]  she said quote i was told not to state publicly that it was a mild illness i have been asked to
[3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:31.680]  refrain from making such statements to say and to say that it is a serious illness i declined
[3:09:31.680 --> 3:09:39.840]  she said so even though she was being pressured and in this article she names scientific experts
[3:09:39.840 --> 3:09:45.600]  in the netherlands in the uk who were telling her don't say that don't give people the good news
[3:09:45.600 --> 3:09:49.600]  that it's nature's vaccine that it's mild and it's not going to cause a serious uptick in
[3:09:49.600 --> 3:09:56.640]  covid-19 hospitalizations we want the justification we want to grease the skids to reimpose mask
[3:09:56.640 --> 3:10:06.800]  mandates to reimpose okay she could only be talking about the sage people who before the
[3:10:06.800 --> 3:10:13.440]  omicron variant emerged in the uk said that if prime minister boris johnson didn't impose strict
[3:10:13.440 --> 3:10:18.720]  lockdown measures lockdown measures that by the way have completely not only devastated the economy
[3:10:18.720 --> 3:10:28.640]  but led to a multimillion increase in nhs waiting list patients up to 740 000 people missed cancer
[3:10:28.640 --> 3:10:33.920]  screenings because of these draconian onerous lockdown policies which have proven completely
[3:10:33.920 --> 3:10:40.000]  wrong even johns hopkins has come out and said that this was wrong to impose these measures it
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:46.800]  caused massive damage all these countries now have to take the l and accept that they were wrong
[3:10:46.800 --> 3:10:52.560]  but when she was saying that she was being told to show up by technocrats in the united kingdom
[3:10:52.560 --> 3:10:58.480]  and in these other european countries this is an absolute scandal and again this needs to be part
[3:10:58.480 --> 3:11:05.040]  of an investigation going forward where the people who deliberately misled the public by over exaggerating
[3:11:05.040 --> 3:11:11.200]  the risk posed by covid-19 causing devastating knock on effects not just for people missing
[3:11:11.200 --> 3:11:16.960]  cancer screenings people missing treatment of serious illnesses and going on to die but of course
[3:11:16.960 --> 3:11:22.400]  the whole mask rule theater which expanded its tentacles into schools of course that's still
[3:11:22.400 --> 3:11:30.240]  taking place in america now there are multiple examples of a 364 increase according to one
[3:11:30.240 --> 3:11:39.040]  speech therapist in cognitive development disorders in children because of the making kids wear masks
[3:11:39.040 --> 3:11:45.120]  that needs to be part of a criminal investigation and the scientists the esteemed experts who
[3:11:45.120 --> 3:11:51.840]  knowingly pushed medical misinformation which led to this catastrophe need to be put in prison
[3:11:52.800 --> 3:12:00.480]  and this story needs to get out there she abided by the WHO's definition of covid-19 as a mild
[3:12:00.480 --> 3:12:06.320]  disease she said quote a serious illness is one in which we see acute pulmonary respiratory
[3:12:06.320 --> 3:12:12.720]  infections people need oxygen maybe even artificial respiration we saw that with delta but not with
[3:12:12.720 --> 3:12:19.840]  omicron this is from the doctor in south africa who first discovered omicron so i said to people
[3:12:19.840 --> 3:12:27.440]  quote i can't say it like that because it's not what we're seeing she was told to tell people to
[3:12:27.440 --> 3:12:32.880]  tell the world in europe in america that omicron was going to cause serious illness a massive
[3:12:32.880 --> 3:12:39.920]  rise in hospitalizations to give the technocrats the justification to lock down further and again
[3:12:39.920 --> 3:12:46.080]  i go back to this poll kek cnc back in august 2020 they asked the average american how many
[3:12:46.080 --> 3:12:51.520]  people in america they thought had died from coronavirus in summer 2020 the average american
[3:12:51.520 --> 3:12:59.120]  thought 30 million people in america alone had died of coronavirus purely because of the hysteria
[3:12:59.120 --> 3:13:07.680]  driven mental reaction the complete overreaction to the fatality rate the threat posed by covid in
[3:13:07.680 --> 3:13:13.440]  the first place so these technocrats in europe wanted her to continue that hysteria she said no
[3:13:14.080 --> 3:13:18.240]  the doctor was asked why health authorities tried to prevent her from telling the truth to which she
[3:13:18.240 --> 3:13:24.800]  responded they tried but they didn't make it she goes on to say quote what i said at one point
[3:13:24.800 --> 3:13:30.000]  because i was just tired of it was in south africa this is a mild illness but in europe it's a very
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:35.840]  serious one so she had to completely contradict what she was seeing on the ground in south africa
[3:13:36.400 --> 3:13:43.280]  to placate these technocrats who wanted to maintain that level of fear mongering but in general
[3:13:43.280 --> 3:13:49.840]  she didn't follow the dictate and she went on bbc cnn and said it's a mild illness this is not
[3:13:49.840 --> 3:13:55.600]  going to cause a massive uptick in hospitalizations what the hell are you doing why are you overreacting
[3:13:56.560 --> 3:14:02.160]  in the uk sage government advisors who she says pressured her literally predicted and i made
[3:14:02.160 --> 3:14:08.880]  multiple videos about this in mid december and was proven completely correct they said omicron
[3:14:08.880 --> 3:14:17.200]  in the uk would cause 6 000 covid deaths a day if harsher restrictions weren't imposed well guess
[3:14:17.200 --> 3:14:22.640]  what those harsher restrictions weren't imposed the one thing that borris johnson got right and now
[3:14:22.640 --> 3:14:31.280]  ons official government data for january in the uk shows the actual deaths are around 93 percent lower
[3:14:31.280 --> 3:14:37.680]  than the sage forecast if borris did not introduce more restrictions they got it wrong just as they
[3:14:37.680 --> 3:14:43.200]  got it wrong back in july in england when they said if you lift the mass mandates if you list
[3:14:43.200 --> 3:14:50.080]  lift the lockdown restrictions on july 19 freedom day we're going to see 4000 hospitalizations a
[3:14:50.080 --> 3:14:55.600]  day it never got anywhere near that they were proven wrong as they've been proven wrong time and time
[3:14:55.600 --> 3:15:03.280]  again absolutely bombshell story should have been covered in legacy media has basically just come
[3:15:03.280 --> 3:15:08.880]  out in a few places and tomorrow it will be completely forgotten meanwhile sweden declares the
[3:15:08.880 --> 3:15:15.440]  pandemic to be over this is from the minister of health leena hallengren who said it's not over
[3:15:15.440 --> 3:15:21.120]  but as we know it in terms of quick changes and restrictions it is reuters reported the comments
[3:15:21.120 --> 3:15:26.880]  were close as possible to the country quote effectively declaring the pandemic is over
[3:15:26.880 --> 3:15:34.000]  bear in mind sweden never imposed harsh restrictions they never imposed harsh mandatory mask rules
[3:15:34.000 --> 3:15:40.960]  and compared to basket case zero covid countries like australia and new zealand they're now exiting
[3:15:40.960 --> 3:15:46.480]  the pandemic lifting all the restrictions while australia new zealand and all these basket case
[3:15:46.480 --> 3:15:52.400]  countries keep them in place she was right sweden was right they were wrong they need to take the
[3:15:52.400 --> 3:16:22.240]  l summit dot news we'll be right god created each and every one of us with free will but we look at the world system now openly announcing the mark of the beast everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies our very productivity our very genetics our very future over to them they

[3:20:05.760 --> 3:20:23.760]  live from the summit.news headquarters it's Paul Joseph Watson
[3:20:23.760 --> 3:20:43.760]  well the esteemed fact checkers have raised their ugly heads once again the ministry of truth whose job is to not reveal the truth but to bury and censor information today in regards to the much wanted safe and effective coronavirus vaccine they've done a fact check
[3:20:43.760 --> 3:21:06.760]  headline AP experts say changes to CDC's vaccination definition are normal move along nothing to see here so they fact check the claim that from 2015 to 2021 the CDC said quote the act of introducing a vaccine into the body to produce immunity to a specific disease
[3:21:06.760 --> 3:21:22.760]  that was the CDC's definition of a vaccine from 2015 to 2021 they fact checked the claim that that has been changed now even though it has been changed it's completely accurate to say that the CDC has changed it
[3:21:22.760 --> 3:21:41.760]  it says claim the census for disease control and prevention has changed its definition of vaccination because COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective now they have changed the definition but the AP fact checkers the ministry of truth says that that's missing context the CDC has altered the language
[3:21:41.760 --> 3:21:58.760]  we were always at war with East Asia in the definition of vaccination on its website including after the development of COVID-19 vaccines so before this one vaccine the CDC said the definition of a vaccine was the act of introducing a vaccine into the body
[3:21:58.760 --> 3:22:15.760]  to produce immunity to a specific disease the fact that the COVID-19 vaccine doesn't provide immunity and therefore isn't widely effective that's been fact checked even though that's a completely accurate statement to make
[3:22:15.760 --> 3:22:34.760]  absolutely incredible case in point Prince Charles triple vaxed boosted vehement proponent of wearing masks today tested COVID positive for the second time because vaccines are effective now they're not a fact effective at least this one hasn't been affected
[3:22:34.760 --> 3:22:52.760]  in stopping immunity that is a fact you can't fact check a verifiable manifestly provable truth even though they're attempting to do that so they did change the definition of vaccine because the COVID-19 vaccine wasn't effective at producing
[3:22:52.760 --> 3:23:10.760]  in their own words before 2022 quote immunity to a specific disease so once again the fact checkers have come out and said oh no that's been debunked even though it hasn't been debunked and it's literally true proven once again today by Prince Charles being double
[3:23:10.760 --> 3:23:27.760]  vaccinated and boosted and catching COVID for the second frigging time on the subject of the Ministry of Truth fact checkers let's go to this video now because we had a story a few days ago about the Biden administration funding crack pipes for drug addicts because
[3:23:27.760 --> 3:23:44.760]  it was proven so effective in San Francisco and Los Angeles Stokes came out and said it was quote most mostly false even though it wasn't false it was completely true once again let's go to this video the fact checkers are the Ministry of Truth here it is
[3:23:44.760 --> 3:24:00.760]  wow turns out fact checkers aren't neutral bastions of impartiality after all they're just corrupt mouthpieces for the establishment fact checkers say narrative that contradicts regime isn't happening yet another case in point the Washington Free Beacon reported that as part of a 30 million
[3:24:00.760 --> 3:24:14.760]  dollar grant program the Biden administration is planning to give out free crack pipes to drug addicts in quote undeserved communities in the name of quote advancing racial equity because it worked out so well in San Francisco
[3:24:14.760 --> 3:24:31.760]  Snopes then conducted a fact check of this report and concluded that it was quote mostly false not because the Biden administration isn't planning to give out free crack pipes to homeless drug addicts they are but because quote this was just one of around
[3:24:31.760 --> 3:24:48.760]  20 components of the grant program and far from its most prominent or important one so they are giving out crack pipes to drug addicts but because that's only one of 20 components of the grant the claim that they're giving out crack pipes to drug addicts is quote mostly false
[3:24:48.760 --> 3:25:06.760]  what? no it isn't they are funding crack pipes for drug addicts that's completely true you admit it in your own article but then claim in the same article that it's mostly false oh now the esteemed Snopes has said it's false then it must be false even though it's literally not false
[3:25:06.760 --> 3:25:22.760]  now they've turned something into fake news contributing to the story being buried by social media algorithms when it's not fake news at all it's actually happening don't forget that Snopes is used by Facebook and others as a neutral independent fact checker
[3:25:22.760 --> 3:25:36.760]  their supposed impartiality is used to bury stories deemed as misinformation and yet Snopes has got it wrong time and time again like when they said it was mostly false that a 1981 Dean Koontz novel predicted coronavirus
[3:25:36.760 --> 3:25:47.760]  despite the story centering around a virus released from a lab called Wuhan 400 Snopes was also an early adopter of the notion that the lab leak theory was a debunked conspiracy theory
[3:25:47.760 --> 3:26:03.760]  a narrative circulated by the very same people working in concert with the Wuhan lab to cover their own behind Snopes routinely fact checks the Babylon B a satirical publication again in an effort to bury it in social media algorithms
[3:26:03.760 --> 3:26:18.760]  they also fact check memes that blatantly not intended to be a portrayal of reality like this one showing AOC on the prices right Snopes falsely claimed it was unproven that American Indian activist Nathan Phillips falsely claimed to be a Vietnam veteran
[3:26:18.760 --> 3:26:27.760]  he did falsely claim to be a Vietnam veteran Snopes hires quote impartial fact checkers who have a history of working with far left news and opinion outlets
[3:26:27.760 --> 3:26:43.760]  Snopes routinely runs cover for Democrats court in embarrassing situations when these entities with a consistent track record of hyper partisanship dishonesty and outright lying are being handed the power to decide what's misinformation and what's credible
[3:26:43.760 --> 3:26:51.760]  that's not fact checking that's cronyism it's a gender driven censorship
[3:26:51.760 --> 3:27:07.760]  there you have it now I've made the point many times that the unvaccinated in today's society represent the most demonized monster and discriminated against minority group that we've seen for generations and we have another example of that today
[3:27:07.760 --> 3:27:24.760]  James Carville says he wants to punch the unvaccinated in the face this is democratic strategist James Carville you during the politics war room podcast said in response to a caller who asked why Biden didn't pass a law banning the unjab from interstate travel
[3:27:24.760 --> 3:27:40.760]  that's right I think you shouldn't be able to drive your car across state lines because he'd chosen not to take a medical procedure he said quote I wish what they do is pass a law to make you immune from liability if you punch some unvaccinated person right in the face
[3:27:40.760 --> 3:27:57.760]  which I'd really like to do said Carville so much for the tolerant left you went on to say if you asked me what's my first reaction to you if you're not vaccinated you don't have any medical reason not to be your piece of SHIT okay I just want to punch you in the face again
[3:27:57.760 --> 3:28:15.760]  this guy's 77 years old I know there's old man strength but I think someone vaccinated Americans should challenge the 77 year old James Carville to a boxing match where he can punch them in the face and they can punch him back
[3:28:15.760 --> 3:28:30.760]  his co-host his co-host went on to agree with violently attacking people who choose not to undergo a medical procedure because that's progressive the two hosts lamented how Biden couldn't ban the unvaccinated from interstate travel because the Supreme Court would knock it down
[3:28:30.760 --> 3:28:56.760]  yeah because it's wildly unconstitutional and a disgrace to the very notion of American liberty there's also a New York Times headline out today an anti-vaxxer dies of COVID do you empathize remember these are the stop bullying and harassment be kind people but if you disagree with them if you don't take a volunteer a medical procedure they want to punch you in the face they're nice people
[3:28:56.760 --> 3:29:12.760]  something very rare is going on and it ends in just three days as of the time I'm taping this announcement on Thursday afternoon coming up this Monday the biggest sale in four years of high quality storeable foods

[3:30:07.760 --> 3:30:27.760]  domestic terrorists the days of independent media are numbered the government has made it illegal to oppose them they are now deep banking us behind the scenes they want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly with practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps
[3:30:27.760 --> 3:30:40.760]  the traders know they can shut us down by force but that would accelerate the awakening exponentially so be it make them silence us by force this is the final battle of the information war

[3:31:13.760 --> 3:31:28.760]  and they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety this is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages

[3:33:27.760 --> 3:33:38.760]  broadcasting internationally from the summit dot news headquarters in the United Kingdom it's Paul Joseph Watson
[3:33:38.760 --> 3:34:01.760]  we are live let's look at council culture according to the left like critical race theory doesn't exist even though it's actionable it's happening it's manifestly provable every single day I made the point on Twitter yesterday the amount of friends I've got who are not even political who when they're applying for a new job a mortgage alone for whatever
[3:34:01.760 --> 3:34:12.760]  you see them lock down their accounts in some cases you see them wipe their social media accounts altogether they're not even political people they're not public figures they're not tweeting anything that spicy
[3:34:12.760 --> 3:34:35.760]  but again that's the point about cancel culture it's primary victims aren't celebrities aren't privileged people with huge platforms they're ordinary people like the guy in Hull a year ago who won his case in the high court by the way who had the police interrogate him for hours call up his workplace he lost his job because he
[3:34:35.760 --> 3:34:48.760]  didn't even say anything he retweeted a limerick that made fun of transgender people in the UK thousands of people are arrested every single year for offensive tweets
[3:34:48.760 --> 3:35:05.760]  cancel culture is real and it affects and impacts and devastates the lives and livelihoods of ordinary working people now there was another cancel culture free speech controversy in the UK during the weekend where a comedian
[3:35:05.760 --> 3:35:20.760]  put out a Netflix show similar to the Dave Chappelle scandal in the United States which came absolutely nothing even though all those freaks with pink hair walked out on their job where a comedian told a joke an edgy holocaust joke
[3:35:20.760 --> 3:35:36.760]  and now they're not only demanding that he bd platformed and that the government sees control regular regulatory control of Netflix but one politician literally called for the people in the audience at that comedy gig to be arrested
[3:35:36.760 --> 3:35:49.760]  for laughing at an offensive joke this is the slippery slope turned into a 200 foot high water slide arrest people who laugh at offensive jokes here's the video let's roll it
[3:35:49.760 --> 3:36:01.760]  broke if you don't want to be offended don't watch it woke cancel comedians who tell offensive jokes bespoke arrest people who laugh at offensive jokes and that's not even a meme
[3:36:01.760 --> 3:36:14.760]  an SNP counselor has literally called for people who find offensive jokes funny to be prosecuted well that slippery slope turned into a 200 foot high water slide in a hurry didn't it what was this in response to
[3:36:14.760 --> 3:36:27.760]  comedian Jimmy Carr telling a spicy gag about gypsies in the holocaust the entirely predictable brain dead response to all this was as if Jimmy Carr had carried out the holocaust not simply told a joke about it
[3:36:27.760 --> 3:36:40.760]  Jimmy Carr's joke the deposit of the holocaust was the slaughter of 500,000 gypsy Roma and Siniti people is disgusting beyond words fucking racist genocide has no place in comedy or a decent society I call on Netflix to remove this contest material
[3:36:40.760 --> 3:36:50.760]  Jimmy Carr's joke like all holocaust jokes is completely dependent on the acceptance that the holocaust was a horrendous atrocity that's what makes the joke work
[3:36:50.760 --> 3:37:00.760]  what also makes jokes in general what they are jokes is the fact that the comedian telling them isn't being serious he's telling a frigging joke
[3:37:00.760 --> 3:37:13.760]  can you know what if you don't agree with any of that and you're still offended you know what option is left open to you don't fucking watch it oh great another opportunity for some middle class metropolitan pants pisser
[3:37:13.760 --> 3:37:21.760]  to score a dopamine hit on Twitter by proving once again what a good person they are I'm offended on their behalf oh piss off
[3:37:21.760 --> 3:37:29.760]  Culture secretary Nadine Dorris said Carr's comments were quote abhorrent and they just shouldn't be on television but they weren't comments
[3:37:29.760 --> 3:37:39.760]  Carr wasn't endorsing genocide it was a joke she then seized upon the controversy to grease the skids for yet more laws restricting you guessed it free speech
[3:37:39.760 --> 3:37:49.760]  Nadine Dorris of course being the same woman who in 2017 complained of quote left wing snowflakes killing comedy it's okay when we do it
[3:37:49.760 --> 3:37:59.760]  of course when Jimmy Carr vilified another minority group in the same show the unvaccinated he was applauded but the establishment says they're bad people
[3:37:59.760 --> 3:38:10.760]  so punching down against that minority group is perfectly permissible now the head of off-com is exploiting the hysteria in an attempt to expand its censorship tentacles to cover Netflix
[3:38:10.760 --> 3:38:19.760]  and as per usual the timing here is a little more than coincidental not only are they trying to create an environment to ram through this media bill to control Netflix
[3:38:19.760 --> 3:38:32.760]  and any similar platform that comes after Netflix they're also pushing an onerous online safety bill there would outlaw speech that causes quote emotional harm to a perceived victim
[3:38:32.760 --> 3:38:42.760]  another vague catchall term completely open to abuse given that enunciating biological facts about sex and gender is now considered hateful
[3:38:42.760 --> 3:38:50.760]  as ever we see the same cycle repeated over and over again feign outrage milk it for power and control feign outrage milk it for power and control
[3:38:50.760 --> 3:39:00.760]  feign outrage milk it for power and control strange that isn't it the solution to people being offended is always to hand over more power and control
[3:39:00.760 --> 3:39:12.760]  to those who claim they were offended the feigned outrage is merely a useful conduit for what they want at all along power and control
[3:39:12.760 --> 3:39:33.760]  speaking of power and control in a completely smooth segue DHS issues terrorism bulletin over jihadist radicals over violent and T for left wing extremist over BLM murderers no they issued a terrorism bulletin over quote conspiracy theories
[3:39:33.760 --> 3:39:47.760]  and misleading narratives yet not trusting CNN that might be a terrorist threat according to the DHS which has issued a new terrorism bulletin in response to concerns over conspiracy theories and misleading narratives
[3:39:47.760 --> 3:39:59.760]  Oh my God the absolute horror this is literally from the DHS this is who they're protecting you from the United States remains in a heightened threat environment fueled by several factors
[3:39:59.760 --> 3:40:14.760]  including people posting things on Twitter that offend others now that's not quote the quote is including an online environment filled with false or misleading narratives like saying that the coronavirus vaccine doesn't stop the spread of coronavirus
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:30.760]  even though it literally doesn't build with false or misleading narratives and conspiracy theories and other forms of mis, dis and malinformation MDM sounds like some kind of drug introduced and or amplified by foreign domestic threat actors
[3:40:30.760 --> 3:40:46.760]  that's anyone who disagrees with CNN the advisory goes on to assert the US is in a heightened threat landscape due to people posting images of grippers on Twitter or no that's not quote the quote is the proliferation of false or misleading narratives
[3:40:46.760 --> 3:41:01.760]  which so discord or undermine public trust in US government institutions because God forbid American citizens should have a healthy distrust of government institutions that's domestic terrorism if ever I heard it
[3:41:01.760 --> 3:41:17.760]  apparently lack of trust in the Biden administration legacy media represents a terrorist threat and as we explain in this article previous DHS bulletins have even suggested that Americans who are angry at COVID lockdown rules God forbid
[3:41:17.760 --> 3:41:34.760]  or who express concerns about election integrity are potential extremist threats. Now we also have the DHS this is out of the Epoch Times posted on zero hedge expressing concern about potential truck convoy protests in America.
[3:41:34.760 --> 3:41:50.760]  Yes, those dangerous comedian Canadians with their unacceptable opinions according to blackface Justin Trudeau, their movement may be mimicked in America and now the US Department of Homeland Security has confirmed it's tracking potential truck
[3:41:50.760 --> 3:42:05.760]  convoy who God forbid might honk their horns, never seen such a disgraceful act of domestic terrorism as honking the horn in the United States after Canadian protests against COVID-19 vaccine mandates unfolded in multiple cities.
[3:42:05.760 --> 3:42:14.760]  There's no evidence that there's even this protest about to happen maybe it is but they're treating it as a potential terrorist threat because they hate the American people.
[3:42:14.760 --> 3:42:29.760]  Meanwhile, RT reports Paris Bands Freedom convoys Paris authorities on Thursday issued an order saying that people can't protest that's an illegal order your right to protest is enshrined in basic human freedoms.
[3:42:29.760 --> 3:42:49.760]  RT also reports EU capital Brussels, where the most popular boy's name is now Mohammed because it's so European, EU capital Bands Freedom convoy protest Brussels Mayor Philippe Close has announced also that he will ban a protest convoy of truckers who will be barred from entering the city.
[3:42:49.760 --> 3:42:55.760]  Again, no dissent allowed but these are the good people listen to them.
[3:42:55.760 --> 3:43:05.760]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying, empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[3:43:05.760 --> 3:43:31.760]  And when it comes to information, boys, that's true today, we see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation, great reset combine, trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives,
[3:43:31.760 --> 3:43:38.760]  their COVID hysteria, their world's gonna end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[3:43:38.760 --> 3:43:45.760]  And none of it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[3:43:45.760 --> 3:43:49.760]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[3:43:49.760 --> 3:43:53.760]  And that's why it's hard to share in full wars links and ban video links.
[3:43:53.760 --> 3:43:56.760]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.

[3:47:07.760 --> 3:47:20.760]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[3:47:20.760 --> 3:47:27.760]  I'm going to come back in the final five minutes of this segment and cover some key final news stories.
[3:47:27.760 --> 3:47:43.760]  First, I want to go to this final video, which is based on a recently revealed report summarized written for the Department of Defense, actually written in 2013, but only recently revealed as a result of a Freedom of Information Act request.
[3:47:43.760 --> 3:48:00.760]  And in this DOD report, it says, bear in mind, this is back in 2013, this is even worse now, that China views the West's embrace of multiculturalism and welchism as a, quote, sickness that will ultimately bring about the collapse.
[3:48:00.760 --> 3:48:16.760]  Beijing sees the United States as obsession with racism and white guilt, which is obviously proven in the teaching of critical race theory throughout American schools as, quote, a strategic vulnerability that will lead to its downfall.
[3:48:16.760 --> 3:48:18.760]  Here's the clip. Let's go to it.
[3:48:18.760 --> 3:48:28.760]  Ever wondered what major foreign powers think about America and the West's obsession with racism?
[3:48:28.760 --> 3:48:31.760]  Our increasingly absurd insistence that diversity is a strength.
[3:48:31.760 --> 3:48:37.760]  Our progressively more desperate search for the benefits of multiculturalism besides cheap labor and Uber Eats.
[3:48:37.760 --> 3:48:38.760]  I wonder no more.
[3:48:38.760 --> 3:48:44.760]  A fascinating one secret Department of Defense report contains some fascinating answers.
[3:48:44.760 --> 3:48:52.760]  The report was commissioned by foreign policy strategist Andrew Marshall and is titled strategic consequences of Chinese racism.
[3:48:52.760 --> 3:48:56.760]  It was released as a result of Freedom of Information Act litigation.
[3:48:56.760 --> 3:49:00.760]  And despite originally being written in 2013, it's more relevant than ever.
[3:49:00.760 --> 3:49:06.760]  A lengthy Twitter thread highlights the key takeaways from the once confidential investigation.
[3:49:06.760 --> 3:49:15.760]  The banner headline, the Chinese see multiculturalism as a sickness that has overtaken the United States and is a component of US decline.
[3:49:15.760 --> 3:49:20.760]  China acknowledges that it is a racist country, but sees that as no problem whatsoever.
[3:49:20.760 --> 3:49:27.760]  And in fact, views the United States as obsession with racism and white guilt as a, quote, strategic vulnerability.
[3:49:27.760 --> 3:49:36.760]  China wants respect to the United States because it was unicultural and, quote, defined by the centrality of Anglo Protestant culture.
[3:49:36.760 --> 3:49:38.760]  What defines America now?
[3:49:38.760 --> 3:49:44.760]  Giant billboards celebrating obese black women, white kids in schools being taught they were born with original sin,
[3:49:44.760 --> 3:49:49.760]  questions over whether white people should be allowed to use non-white emojis, George Floyd statues.
[3:49:49.760 --> 3:49:56.760]  I think what annoys me most about white people is when they pretend like they're the victim.
[3:49:56.760 --> 3:50:04.760]  The author of the DOD report acknowledges that CRT was prevalent in Hollywood and television a decade ago.
[3:50:04.760 --> 3:50:09.760]  Hollywood television magazines and more recently blogs take the issue of racism very seriously.
[3:50:09.760 --> 3:50:16.760]  Anti-racist messages are common in film and television, while positive images of racial minorities are heavily emphasized.
[3:50:16.760 --> 3:50:24.760]  Hollywood and television take their monitoring and policing of the public sphere seriously and work to identify violators
[3:50:24.760 --> 3:50:29.760]  and punishing them through ridicule or through expulsion from the community and acceptable companies.
[3:50:29.760 --> 3:50:35.760]  So the deep state was already praising cancel culture before cancel culture was even a thing.
[3:50:35.760 --> 3:50:41.760]  Also note the acknowledgement and veneration of critical race theory, which leftists still claim doesn't even exist.
[3:50:41.760 --> 3:50:50.760]  The primary and secondary educational system has been completely remade since the 1970s to emphasize the contributions of racial minorities in the dangers of racism.
[3:50:50.760 --> 3:50:59.760]  The students receive instruction about the evils of prejudice and bigotry from K-12, while positive education about minorities is heavily emphasized.
[3:50:59.760 --> 3:51:06.760]  For the American student today, anti-racism and minority history months are as much a part of his primary and secondary education
[3:51:06.760 --> 3:51:10.760]  as instruction in mathematics, government or physical education.
[3:51:10.760 --> 3:51:18.760]  The author then notes how racism, xenophobia and ethnocentrism as an innate survival mechanism isn't unique to the Chinese,
[3:51:18.760 --> 3:51:24.760]  but in fact represents quote, common behaviors found worldwide and universally.
[3:51:24.760 --> 3:51:31.760]  The report comments on how the Chinese, specifically the Han, view themselves as quote, a single pure race,
[3:51:31.760 --> 3:51:37.760]  and that their worldview is predicated on the idea that quote, the greatest force is common blood.
[3:51:37.760 --> 3:51:45.760]  Unlike Westerners, the Chinese strongly believe the Maoist assertion that national unity is dependent not just on cultural values,
[3:51:45.760 --> 3:51:48.760]  but on quote, biological continuity.
[3:51:48.760 --> 3:51:56.760]  The DOD author notes that the Chinese embrace racism not just as an innate reflexive mindset, but as a source of great strength,
[3:51:56.760 --> 3:52:01.760]  and that that's quote, a huge advantage for the Chinese over the West.
[3:52:01.760 --> 3:52:08.760]  According to Chinese thinking quote, racism is a Western problem, the artifact of Western history and Western culture,
[3:52:08.760 --> 3:52:11.760]  and it must be said a Western obsession.
[3:52:11.760 --> 3:52:13.760]  It is also a Western weakness.
[3:52:13.760 --> 3:52:21.760]  The obsession with race and race guilt introduces a vulnerability into Western societies that many non-Western peoples have exploited.
[3:52:21.760 --> 3:52:28.760]  More importantly, it has led to a loss of confidence in the West in its identity while fracturing its cohesion.
[3:52:28.760 --> 3:52:35.760]  Chinese racism towards people with darker skin colors is contrasted by their genetic exaltation of white people,
[3:52:35.760 --> 3:52:41.760]  which is why the phenomenon of Chinese women seeking out white men for procreation continues to be a strong trend.
[3:52:41.760 --> 3:52:48.760]  On the flip side, their view of black people is that their quote, ugly, uncivilized, and have a low degree of intelligence.
[3:52:48.760 --> 3:52:55.760]  Elsewhere in the document, it's explained how the Chinese view blacks as quote, prone to crime, particularly violent crime.
[3:52:55.760 --> 3:53:00.760]  This is doctrine was also evident when Air China published an edition of their official magazine,
[3:53:00.760 --> 3:53:06.760]  which warns Chinese tourists about visiting London quote, London is generally a safe place to travel.
[3:53:06.760 --> 3:53:12.760]  However, precautions are needed when entering areas mainly populated by Indians, Pakistanis, and black people.
[3:53:12.760 --> 3:53:16.760]  This racist view also informs Chinese commercial expansion into Africa,
[3:53:16.760 --> 3:53:22.760]  with the Chinese believing they have the right to exploit Africans due to their perceived superior racial heritage.
[3:53:22.760 --> 3:53:28.760]  The Chinese are perplexed that the West has abandoned the American creed in favor of quote,
[3:53:28.760 --> 3:53:36.760]  an explicitly multi-racial multicultural society that celebrates differences rather than acquiring assimilation.
[3:53:36.760 --> 3:53:42.760]  In rejecting the West's core principles and replacing them with adulation of any culture that isn't Western,
[3:53:42.760 --> 3:53:50.760]  the United States is, according to China, quote, rejecting the principles that made the country gray and united it.
[3:53:50.760 --> 3:53:56.760]  The march of multiculturalism is, again, according to the Chinese, a sickness that quote,
[3:53:56.760 --> 3:54:03.760]  conspires to cause the breakdown of American society and the lack of purpose in life for most Americans.
[3:54:03.760 --> 3:54:08.760]  The DOD author notes that the Chinese don't feel the need to confront America militarily
[3:54:08.760 --> 3:54:14.760]  because they think the country will collapse of its own accord as a result of racial separatism and internal strife.
[3:54:14.760 --> 3:54:20.760]  Now, you can watch the rest of that report on summit.news and in the video,
[3:54:20.760 --> 3:54:26.760]  I make the point that the conclusion of that report that was given to the DOD back in 2013
[3:54:26.760 --> 3:54:32.760]  was that to discredit the Chinese, you needed to make the point that China was a racist country.
[3:54:32.760 --> 3:54:38.760]  What we've actually seen specifically over the past few years since the George Floyd riots
[3:54:38.760 --> 3:54:45.760]  is the assertion by the US political class. Not that China's a racist country, they don't really care about that,
[3:54:45.760 --> 3:54:53.760]  but that America is a racist country, so they literally follow the opposite advice of what they were told to do back in 2013
[3:54:53.760 --> 3:54:56.760]  and it hasn't worked out so well for them, has it?
[3:54:56.760 --> 3:55:00.760]  On that subject, information, liberation reports, DOD diversity and quality,
[3:55:00.760 --> 3:55:04.760]  equity, inclusion on necessities in US military.
[3:55:04.760 --> 3:55:08.760]  They haven't really learned their lesson, have they? Department of Defense on Wednesday,
[3:55:08.760 --> 3:55:13.760]  and again, that's the same bureaucracy that was handed this report back in 2013,
[3:55:13.760 --> 3:55:21.760]  posted an article claiming that diversity, equity and inclusion are necessities in the US military and act as a force multiplier.
[3:55:21.760 --> 3:55:27.760]  And basically, the senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense for Human Capital, diversity, equity and inclusion,
[3:55:27.760 --> 3:55:37.760]  yes, that's actually a job, Bishop Garrison said that it's a necessity and in fact a strength of the US military to seek out diversity.
[3:55:37.760 --> 3:55:45.760]  I would argue it would be a strength to seek out the best people for the best possible roles at their most skilled at regardless of their skin colour,
[3:55:45.760 --> 3:55:48.760]  but we don't live in that world.
[3:55:48.760 --> 3:55:53.760]  Meanwhile, scientists discover genetic material suggesting COVID came from Chinese lab.
[3:55:53.760 --> 3:55:58.760]  What? But the fact checkers told me that was a racist conspiracy theory.
[3:55:58.760 --> 3:56:06.760]  Scientists in Hungary examining a unique variant of COVID-19 have discovered genetic material that suggests the strain was being examined in a Chinese lab,
[3:56:06.760 --> 3:56:16.760]  bolstering the lab leak theory, which of course the esteemed fact checkers told us back in 2020 was fake news and led to the de-platforming censorship
[3:56:16.760 --> 3:56:26.760]  and banishment of numerous prominent individuals, despite the fact that Peter Dajak, one of the guys over Facebook's fact checking network,
[3:56:26.760 --> 3:56:37.760]  was intimately tied to the Wuhan lab and in fact investigated it as part of this discovery mission to try and find out if the virus was leaked from the lab.
[3:56:37.760 --> 3:56:47.760]  Of course, when Mr Dajak went to the lab with the other WHO investigators, they basically walked around for a couple of hours and asked some of the researchers at the Wuhan lab,
[3:56:47.760 --> 3:56:54.760]  oh by the way, this coronavirus, this deadly pandemic, this COVID-19, did you release that?
[3:56:54.760 --> 3:56:57.760]  And they were told, no, we had nothing to do with it.
[3:56:57.760 --> 3:57:00.760]  Okay, case closed, they all left.
[3:57:00.760 --> 3:57:05.760]  I was literally there investigation back in 2020.
[3:57:05.760 --> 3:57:13.760]  Now genetic material from Chinese hamsters and green monkeys was discovered as part of this research project,
[3:57:13.760 --> 3:57:21.760]  which quote may suggest the virus was being examined in a lab using either the animals themselves or their cells.
[3:57:21.760 --> 3:57:35.760]  Viscount Ridley said that such evidence bolsters the theory that the virus was accidentally escaped, always leaked deliberately from the Wuhan lab, so yet more evidence proving that it did indeed come from that lab.
[3:57:35.760 --> 3:57:39.760]  The thing that they told you was a racist conspiracy theory up until about a year ago.
[3:57:39.760 --> 3:57:40.760]  That's going to wrap it up.
[3:57:40.760 --> 3:57:41.760]  War Room is coming up next.
[3:57:41.760 --> 3:57:43.760]  Summit, don't use and going.
[3:57:43.760 --> 3:57:48.760]  Something very rare is going on.
