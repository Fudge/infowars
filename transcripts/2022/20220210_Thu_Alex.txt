[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:01.029]  World exclusive!
[00:00:01.809 --> 00:00:11.172]  Globalists only planning to pause lockdowns, masked mandates, forced injections long enough until large crowds disappear.
[00:00:11.692 --> 00:00:15.513]  This is a tried and true globalist strategy.
[00:00:15.673 --> 00:00:22.135]  They exploit their narrative control and the attention span of the masses to slowly but surely get what they want.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.662]  Only by being aware of their lies and playing a long-term game can we defeat them.
[00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:38.566]  Also, Justin Trudeau's brother is joining us live on air to discuss the dictatorship now being established by his sibling's controllers.
[00:00:38.925 --> 00:00:45.925]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:47.925]  [Music]
[00:00:47.925 --> 00:00:49.925]  [Music]
[00:00:50.443 --> 00:00:51.165]  Insurrection.
[00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:52.567]  A threat to democracy.
[00:00:52.607 --> 00:00:53.869]  This city is under siege.
[00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:55.751]  They are now calling it an occupation.
[00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:57.334]  Alarming situation there in Ottawa.
[00:00:57.374 --> 00:01:01.981]  The police chief is calling it a nationwide insurrection driven by madness.
[00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.964]  I think it's part of the globalization of Trumpism.
[00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:05.506]  Canadians know where I stand.
[00:01:05.606 --> 00:01:11.190]  There hasn't been as much violence as some had perhaps projected, but that does not necessarily mean that it has been peaceful.
[00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.652]  Residents say they feel like hostages.
[00:01:13.712 --> 00:01:16.014]  Some protesters harassed a soup kitchen.
[00:01:16.054 --> 00:01:20.377]  These anti-vaxxers actually took food from the mouths of the homeless.
[00:01:20.537 --> 00:01:21.178]  Hungry, yeah.
[00:01:21.278 --> 00:01:23.339]  Because they're so put upon.
[00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.742]  The small fringe minority.
[00:01:28.058 --> 00:01:36.164]  Of people who are on their way to Ottawa or who are holding unacceptable views that they're expressing.
[00:01:36.284 --> 00:01:38.766]  Many of them are holding confederate flags.
[00:01:38.906 --> 00:01:41.328]  I've heard there's QAnon supporters in the crowd.
[00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:43.909]  We've seen swastikas, we've seen the confederate flag.
[00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:55.778]  This is a story of a country that got through this pandemic by being united and a few people shouting and waving swastikas does not define who Canadians are.
[00:01:57.089 --> 00:02:00.091]  It's a cult.
[00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:01.231]  Yes, it is.
[00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:09.955]  The big issue here is that the truckers and their horns are, ladies and gentlemen, the sound of freedom.
[00:02:12.437 --> 00:02:13.717]  You hear that eerie sound?
[00:02:13.797 --> 00:02:18.540]  It's not when they find the obelisk on the moon in 2001 Space Odyssey.
[00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:32.760]   It is the Very eerie sound of tens of thousands of trucks and cars honking their horns 24 hours a day.
[00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:39.768]  In the capital of the seized nation under globalist control, Canada.
[00:02:40.548 --> 00:02:46.511]  It's a beautiful example of non-violent resistance and solidarity, and so that's why they're calling him terrorist.
[00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:56.315]  This is a rally for truckers, but it's also a rally for the 60% of Canadians who say they worry they can't afford food.
[00:02:56.395 --> 00:03:03.488]   It's for the 60-year-old small businessman who spent his entire adult life building up This is prison.
[00:03:03.528 --> 00:03:04.988]  This is way bigger.
[00:03:04.808 --> 00:03:08.808]  Depressed 14 year old who's been locked out of school.
[00:03:08.808 --> 00:03:11.808]  It's for the families that can't take it anymore.
[00:03:11.808 --> 00:03:15.808]   It's for the people who want to stand up and speak for their freedoms.
[00:03:15.808 --> 00:03:21.808]   It's for all those that our government and our media have insulted and left behind.
[00:03:21.808 --> 00:03:24.808]  This is prison. This is way bigger.
[00:03:24.808 --> 00:03:32.808]   This is a group of well-polished professional people that are trying to overthrow the government
[00:03:32.808 --> 00:03:36.408]   government of democratically elected government of this country.
[00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:39.621]  This is not It's not a target on the city of Ottawa.
[00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:40.821]  It's much bigger than that.
[00:03:40.942 --> 00:03:44.984]  It's really an insurrection It's a it's an attack on our democracy.
[00:03:45.064 --> 00:03:51.488]  It's an attack on our federal government It has a lot of international elements to it.
[00:03:51.628 --> 00:03:57.071]  The money is flowing from the US This is right out of the Trump playbook.
[00:03:57.111 --> 00:04:08.389]   These globalists trick us With people like Trump, and I'm not saying Trump's overall bad, but by bringing him in, making the left hate him, to get the left to do things, as a general public, they would never go along with.
[00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:16.155]  And then now we get so mad at the left, when the right wing gets in power, it will then do things to stop them, and at the end of the day, all of our liberties are gone.
[00:04:16.635 --> 00:04:20.078]  All of our freedoms are gone, and wars of global domination take place.
[00:04:20.298 --> 00:04:29.336]   Because make no mistake, They're not setting up censorship systems and AI control grids and kill switches everywhere because they want to take Alex Jones off the air, Joe Rogan off the air.
[00:04:29.376 --> 00:04:31.418]  They want to take everybody off the air.
[00:04:31.878 --> 00:04:36.322]  You will only get prescribed communications in the system that's coming.
[00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:42.284]  You're not going to get the open free internet anymore under the nuclear war plan, under the biological weapon plan.
[00:04:42.925 --> 00:04:44.266]  And those are just two of the plans.
[00:04:44.526 --> 00:04:55.997]  Then they've also got the giant cyber attack they're going to blame on Russia or Patriot groups already pre-planning and preparing the mines out there with that information.
[00:04:56.037 --> 00:05:02.103]  It's more likely we're going to end up, if we end up in a war, a real shooting war.
[00:05:03.038 --> 00:05:06.799]  With a major power, it's going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach.
[00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:08.660]  Of great consequence.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.740]  So, I love my family.
[00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:12.781]  And I love all of you.
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:18.141]   And I just need to tell you that you need to get ready for absolute hell on earth.
[00:05:18.141 --> 00:05:28.540]  Well, the dictator of Canada's biological brother.
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:38.540]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:05:29.915 --> 00:05:32.176]  They got the same mother is going to be joining us.
[00:05:32.196 --> 00:05:40.778]  He's got all the inside baseball and he's broken his silence like so many of the Royal Mounted Police and local police and bureaucrats have saying this is evil.
[00:05:40.818 --> 00:05:42.659]  This is a planned permanent takeover.
[00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:43.979]  A great reset.
[00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:51.162]  He's a really smart fella and we look forward to Kyle Kemper Trudeau's half-brother joining us in the second hour today.
[00:05:51.222 --> 00:05:54.883]  Paul Joseph Watson, below us the fourth hour from London, England.
[00:05:55.363 --> 00:06:04.998]   And then Owen Schroer, the mighty cuck slayer We'll be hosting the fourth hour before the federal government says that he actually killed people.
[00:06:05.038 --> 00:06:14.884]  That's a turn of phrase from his debating skills over the years when he was dubbed that six years ago or so online as the Cuck Destroyer.
[00:06:15.644 --> 00:06:19.286]  OK, and the Cuck Destroyer can be heard weekdays at 3 p.m.
[00:06:19.306 --> 00:06:20.947]  Central when my broadcast ends.
[00:06:23.128 --> 00:06:32.452]   You know, I want to talk about the big picture here, and I really want this to sink in because I know that We have millions of listeners who are the tip of the spear of the human awakening.
[00:06:34.332 --> 00:06:40.734]  And we also have Senator Paul listening and we have people like Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan listen quite a bit.
[00:06:41.694 --> 00:06:43.754]  And a lot of other important people listen.
[00:06:43.774 --> 00:06:50.736]  I don't want to be very, very, very, very clear about something here because these are two similar things.
[00:06:52.136 --> 00:06:56.717]  It's fun to make fun of Biden and how he can't think and how he's a joke and it makes the Democrats look like fools.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.963]  But in the end, he'll get the blame for all the tyranny, and they won't.
[00:07:01.264 --> 00:07:07.291]  That's why they put him in there to be a laughingstock while they wreck the country, and then hope you never figure out it was part of the Great Reset.
[00:07:07.831 --> 00:07:17.082]  Klaus Schwab, the UN, the IMF, the World Bank talk about wrecking countries, which they've done all over the world, and making sure no one ever knows who did it to them.
[00:07:17.557 --> 00:07:29.428]  Because as soon as you figure out who's doing it, and what the carbon taxes are, and what the global warming greenhouse BS is about, and what all the racism obsession is about, and what all this is about, then it's game over for them.
[00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:38.016]  So it feels good to get up here and say, man, the whole leftist system is in trouble worldwide, and these politicians are hated.
[00:07:39.077 --> 00:07:41.279]  In France, and in the UK, and in Germany.
[00:07:42.845 --> 00:07:43.525]  And in Canada.
[00:07:44.006 --> 00:07:45.746]  But see, the puppets come and go.
[00:07:46.147 --> 00:07:54.170]  They get rewarded after with their $10 million a year corporate CEO jobs, and presidential jobs of corporations where they just play golf all day.
[00:07:54.630 --> 00:08:10.257]  And then a new group of the next generation, or the new alumni of Klaus Schwab's Bilderberg, World Government, Davos Group, World Economic Forum system, like shark teeth, roll into position.
[00:08:10.577 --> 00:08:15.832]   So I want to point out the whole Pedigree of this and and who's doing it and how it's
[00:08:15.832 --> 00:08:18.411]   happening and how we stop it because we have a global awakening to that
[00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:21.742]  It's game over and that's starting to happen really fast.
[00:08:21.742 --> 00:08:25.173]   And that's really good. And once you see it, you can't unsee it
[00:08:25.173 --> 00:08:34.242]   I've had two-star generals and You name it across the board just say man, I never got it
[00:08:34.242 --> 00:08:40.328]   until I started listening to you And then once I saw it, I didn't need to listen to you anymore because I could see it myself and it's dead on.
[00:08:40.588 --> 00:08:42.849]  And now things that don't make sense just make total sense.
[00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.890]  Exactly.
[00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.091]  Because I'm not telling you what to think.
[00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:48.732]  I'm saying, hey, you can't see this image from here.
[00:08:49.172 --> 00:08:50.553]  Step three feet over here.
[00:08:51.413 --> 00:08:52.994]  Just come right, come right here.
[00:08:53.154 --> 00:08:55.335]  Oh, what do you see right there?
[00:08:56.455 --> 00:08:57.576]  Yeah, now you see it, don't you?
[00:08:58.965 --> 00:09:00.986]  So first you can't see it, now you do see it.
[00:09:01.066 --> 00:09:11.612]  So just like we celebrate what an idiot Biden is, and I hate his guts, and I hate the Democratic Party, and they're all just a bunch of scum, but they're just criminals they put in there to take the heat while they all insider trade and screw us over.
[00:09:11.632 --> 00:09:16.254]  And it's the same thing with the end to the lockdowns.
[00:09:16.274 --> 00:09:23.153]   Remember a year and a half ago, more than a year and a half ago, I said, "After this
[00:09:23.153 --> 00:09:27.355]   goes on for six months or so, they're going to pull back some of the pressure around the
[00:09:27.355 --> 00:09:30.394]   world and then they'll just bring it right back even stronger the next time."
[00:09:30.394 --> 00:09:35.653]   And if you actually look at what they're really doing versus the rhetoric, they have only
[00:09:35.653 --> 00:09:42.014]   been tightening down all over the world the last two years, except in some western and
[00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:45.674]   midwestern and southern states of the US that didn't go along with it.
[00:09:45.674 --> 00:09:48.673]   Hell, much of Latin America is still under total lockdown martial law.
[00:09:48.673 --> 00:09:51.274]  A lot of Africa is still under it.
[00:09:51.274 --> 00:09:55.514]  France, Germany, it's getting more intense.
[00:09:55.487 --> 00:09:57.611]  Austria forced door-to-door injections.
[00:09:57.671 --> 00:09:59.314]  Germany is announcing it's about to start.
[00:09:59.694 --> 00:10:01.257]  They said February 1st, but it hasn't.
[00:10:01.578 --> 00:10:05.946]  I've got clips today where they say it's going to be compulsory soon.
[00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:13.590]  So all of this is going on, and so we're hearing, oh, they're going to take the restrictions off.
[00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.831]  Oh, they're going to back off.
[00:10:15.192 --> 00:10:20.337]  But notice the CDC says, OK, you don't need to wear a mask, but the airlines still are going to do it.
[00:10:20.878 --> 00:10:23.821]  Oh, and the public schools are still going to do it because they get federal funds to do it.
[00:10:24.342 --> 00:10:26.785]  Oh, and the private corporations are going to try to demand it.
[00:10:27.325 --> 00:10:33.867]  And so just like they have sanctuary cities in the US, 800 plus of them, where illegal aliens can commit crimes, you name it, don't get in trouble.
[00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:47.530]  It's the same thing now where they're going to have their cult-like enforcement in the city still and in the different countries they've conquered, like Germany, like Austria, like Australia, like New Zealand, like Scotland.
[00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:56.899]   And it's all the same management, the same alumni of the Bilderberg group, public Private partnership with the UN and others.
[00:10:57.619 --> 00:10:58.500]  And they're just there.
[00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:04.663]  And so they've already bitten off a large part of the elephant.
[00:11:05.423 --> 00:11:06.944]  And they're trying to digest that right now.
[00:11:06.984 --> 00:11:10.925]  So they're, they're going to give you a little bit of a rest to make you think you've won.
[00:11:11.205 --> 00:11:15.347]  So all these networks and individuals that stood up and spoke out will kind of go away.
[00:11:16.748 --> 00:11:19.109]  And so yeah, they gained a million miles of tyranny on us.
[00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:21.230]  But we push it back.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.340]  700,000 miles.
[00:11:26.841 --> 00:11:33.004]  But they've still got 700 plus thousand miles on us.
[00:11:34.685 --> 00:11:37.727]  So they take us a million and a half, two million, three million miles into tyranny.
[00:11:38.027 --> 00:11:40.129]  We push them back 50, 60, 70 percent.
[00:11:40.469 --> 00:11:42.030]  We're still deep down in the pit.
[00:11:43.331 --> 00:11:44.112]  So what's the answer?
[00:11:44.232 --> 00:11:56.563]  Knowing the project, knowing how it works, knowing their tactics, knowing they wrote white papers on how they would squeeze us, then let off a little bit, then squeeze even tighter, then let off a little less, and then finally just break your neck.
[00:11:57.509 --> 00:12:12.383]  They're putting in the World ID, they're putting in the tracking systems, they're putting in the Cashless Society hell system that once everything's digital, they can seize it or turn it off however they want and it's all going to be tied to your behavior and how you submit to them.
[00:12:12.683 --> 00:12:16.927]  This is a nightmare hell that we are being inducted into.
[00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:25.062]  When we come back from break, I'm going to boil down the fact that we actually pushed them back farther than they thought.
[00:12:25.223 --> 00:12:26.424]  They knew we'd push them back some.
[00:12:26.804 --> 00:12:27.805]  They knew we'd rise up.
[00:12:27.825 --> 00:12:28.946]  They're actually totally freaked out.
[00:12:28.986 --> 00:12:29.626]  They're in deep trouble.
[00:12:30.006 --> 00:12:31.488]  They miscalculated this blow up in their face.
[00:12:32.248 --> 00:12:37.452]  That just means they're going to pull a bunch of other serious scams they've got in their arsenal, and I've been studying what they're preparing.
[00:12:38.273 --> 00:12:39.374]  We'll tell you about that coming up.
[00:12:40.219 --> 00:12:42.360]  But first, let's play a clip from COVID-1984.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.080]  He always says important things.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:52.262]  Mandates and restrictions are being lifted around the world, but at 1.38, in a minute 38, he lays it out perfectly.
[00:12:52.302 --> 00:12:52.742]  Here it is.
[00:12:53.082 --> 00:12:57.543]  Well, it is great to see mandates and restrictions finally being rolled back in many places around the world.
[00:12:58.123 --> 00:13:04.545]  Are we supposed to be thanking the government officials and the experts who initially imposed these restrictions on us in the first place?
[00:13:05.658 --> 00:13:09.282]  Only then to allow us to have some of our freedoms back now.
[00:13:09.302 --> 00:13:10.904]  It's an honest question.
[00:13:11.946 --> 00:13:12.687]  So why now?
[00:13:13.548 --> 00:13:19.355]  Well, they say it's because the numbers are down and we all did such a great job obeying the restrictions and the mandates.
[00:13:19.775 --> 00:13:21.577]  And it proves that they work, right?
[00:13:22.718 --> 00:13:28.321]  So in other words, don't be surprised if and when they say it's time to reimpose them in the not-too-distant future.
[00:13:29.442 --> 00:13:37.927]  The timing is also curious when you consider that the nice weather is coming and people might be more inclined to attend a demonstration or a rally, perhaps.
[00:13:38.727 --> 00:13:48.953]  There's also some key elections coming up that, you know, maybe they want to relieve some of the pressure from the valve, so to speak, as people have grown tired of COVID-1984 and those who impose it.
[00:13:51.175 --> 00:14:08.254]  While lifting the restrictions and the mandates can and should be seen as a victory for freedom and for the people, make no mistake, this was also a major victory for the technocrats and the social engineers who have successfully turned two weeks to flatten the curve into two years.
[00:14:09.435 --> 00:14:10.997]  And now the groundwork has been laid.
[00:14:11.437 --> 00:14:13.239]  The infrastructure has been established.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.244]  And in another generation or so, this will become the new normal they promised us.
[00:14:18.585 --> 00:14:18.985]  That's right.
[00:14:19.185 --> 00:14:20.407]  If it hasn't already.
[00:14:20.927 --> 00:14:22.048]  Unless we do something about it.
[00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:30.838]  So be wary of those who declare emergency after emergency only to offer the solution to you on a silver platter.
[00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:32.411]  Perfectly said.
[00:14:32.431 --> 00:14:34.212]  The video's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:14:34.232 --> 00:14:36.513]  We're posting it in the live show feed area.
[00:14:36.993 --> 00:14:40.115]  The children have been traumatized, brain damaged, on record hurt.
[00:14:40.555 --> 00:14:46.299]  The key is pushing back, gaining ground, and prosecuting and suing Big Pharma and The Globalist.
[00:14:46.319 --> 00:14:47.419]  And by the way, that's all happening.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.342]  Pfizer just sent the letter out two days ago to its shareholders saying, we're in deep trouble.
[00:14:52.602 --> 00:14:56.865]  The clinical trials that this doesn't work and kills people are coming out, and now their stock prices are plunging.
[00:14:57.961 --> 00:14:59.361]  So let me just say it very simply.
[00:14:59.381 --> 00:15:02.302]  I think as an audience, you know this more than I do or as well as I do.
[00:15:02.842 --> 00:15:09.323]  So we need to get this out to the next group of people and then get them to tell the next group and tell them to tell the next group and so on.
[00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:13.724]  Because it's effective to tell somebody, but you got to explain, hey, you're on a mission.
[00:15:13.744 --> 00:15:14.924]  You got to warn other people now.
[00:15:17.404 --> 00:15:22.265]  And that's how human power can override the big corporations and the corrupt globalists and the censorship.
[00:15:22.305 --> 00:15:24.566]  So it's not like I just said this.
[00:15:24.626 --> 00:15:26.466]  In fact, the Archivist does an incredible job.
[00:15:28.775 --> 00:15:30.937]  Every time I ask for this on air within a few days, I get it.
[00:15:31.197 --> 00:15:51.131]  I'd like to ask the archivist to go back to February, March, April, May, June, July of 2020, where I even showed graphs and explained that they'll do lockdowns and then partially take the restrictions off of the mask and force injections and then bring them back and so on and so forth.
[00:15:51.171 --> 00:15:59.758]   But areas like Australia and Germany, where They get full control, they will just press and press and press and press and never stop.
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.563]  But where you say no, they'll back off and then bring it back, back off and bring it back, trying to exhaust you.
[00:16:06.923 --> 00:16:21.214]  But if you're aware that you've got to fight a bunch of battles to win the war, well you're going to get geared up for war, psychologically, information war, political, non-violent, civil disobedience war, just the war for your mind, and you're going to enjoy it!
[00:16:21.434 --> 00:16:24.857]  You're not glad they're attacking, you're not glad it's happening, but you kind of get into it!
[00:16:26.081 --> 00:16:27.242]  I mean, they're not breaking me!
[00:16:28.463 --> 00:16:30.664]  Except I'm getting me so fired up, I might have a heart attack.
[00:16:31.705 --> 00:16:33.186]  I'm the opposite of about to break.
[00:16:34.647 --> 00:16:38.550]  I'm about to strangle these people, but I know that's what they want, so I'm gonna do it politically.
[00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.151]  I'm gonna do it with information.
[00:16:40.171 --> 00:16:41.132]  I'm gonna hurt them.
[00:16:42.373 --> 00:16:44.374]  Because they deserve to be hurt, because they're bad people.
[00:16:44.574 --> 00:16:48.017]  They want Joe Rogan to apologize, claiming he put out this info when he didn't?
[00:16:49.158 --> 00:16:50.959]  They said, well, get off your back when you apologize.
[00:16:51.379 --> 00:16:53.421]  I told him, I said, you apologize, it'll get ten times worse.
[00:16:53.741 --> 00:16:56.877]   So he came out a few days ago and said, I'm not going to apologize.
[00:16:56.897 --> 00:16:57.758]  This is a bunch of BS.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:16:59.860]  Bunch of nonsense.
[00:17:00.641 --> 00:17:01.762]  I apologize to some people.
[00:17:01.782 --> 00:17:06.808]  I might have hurt their feelings, but I don't apologize to the corporations and the corrupt groups that just want to silence me.
[00:17:07.008 --> 00:17:08.670]  They don't care about people.
[00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:10.572]  They care about shutting us up.
[00:17:14.996 --> 00:17:22.768]   So just as night follows day and day follows night, The globalists are not going to stop this.
[00:17:22.808 --> 00:17:27.873]  The people they've got under their control, they're going to continue to turn the screws on, because they want full dominance.
[00:17:28.334 --> 00:17:29.335]  They want to suck them dry.
[00:17:29.355 --> 00:17:30.056]  These are predators.
[00:17:32.258 --> 00:17:39.206]  But I wanted to play a clip out of New York, because this is still going on everywhere around the world where the globalists are in control, and they have no intention of it ending.
[00:17:39.446 --> 00:17:41.148]  So people say, oh, I don't care about New York.
[00:17:42.236 --> 00:17:44.418]  I don't care about L.A., screw them, I'll just move out of there.
[00:17:44.678 --> 00:17:47.141]  Well, after they've captured the coast, they're going to move against us.
[00:17:47.221 --> 00:17:50.604]  So, we better have empathy for Canada, and empathy for New York.
[00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:51.925]  Might as well be North Korea.
[00:17:52.205 --> 00:17:56.169]  And for Germany, and Austria, and Australia.
[00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:04.177]  Because the same New World Order corporations are taking over our countries, and our towns, and our cities, and our families, are the ones that have got them.
[00:18:07.955 --> 00:18:20.737]  So here's what's happening yesterday in New York, where the police come in, just like in Canada, in a Catholic church, or in a Protestant church in Canada, or in a Catholic church in Australia, and say, oh, he's not wearing a mask!
[00:18:20.797 --> 00:18:21.858]  And they go arrest him!
[00:18:23.718 --> 00:18:29.319]  A cult wanting to see your submission, like women having to wear a mask in Saudi Arabia as a symbol of their submission.
[00:18:29.879 --> 00:18:32.820]  And anybody that's got a mask on is now second-class citizens.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.560]  All the elites don't have to wear their mask.
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:35.280]  Here's the clip.
[00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:38.790]  About the Chinese New Year, lookit.
[00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:39.671]  Oh, they found him.
[00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:42.072]  Lookit.
[00:18:43.093 --> 00:18:43.633]  They found him.
[00:18:44.053 --> 00:18:48.055]  Oh, time to- Look at this!
[00:18:48.255 --> 00:18:49.136]  Look at this!
[00:18:49.296 --> 00:18:50.977]  Look- What are you doing?!
[00:18:51.357 --> 00:18:52.698]  What the fuck are you doing?!
[00:18:53.698 --> 00:18:54.799]  What are you doing?! !
[00:18:56.155 --> 00:18:57.376]  What are you doing?
[00:18:57.396 --> 00:18:59.357]  What are you doing?
[00:19:00.358 --> 00:19:01.699]  Holy crap!
[00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:03.000]  Holy crap!
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.561]  That's assault!
[00:19:05.021 --> 00:19:06.242]  That is assault!
[00:19:06.522 --> 00:19:08.643]  Oh my God!
[00:19:08.783 --> 00:19:10.284]  Oh my God!
[00:19:10.384 --> 00:19:11.325]  This goes on for a while.
[00:19:11.365 --> 00:19:12.166]  They slam him down.
[00:19:12.206 --> 00:19:13.887]  The full things on Infowars.com.
[00:19:14.347 --> 00:19:16.869]  But here's a father out in occupied California.
[00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:29.215]  Who has his special needs daughter that can't even talk now that she wears this mask and is having oxygen deprivation, talking about that he'll never put up with this again and he's so ashamed that he submitted to this evil.
[00:19:29.895 --> 00:19:31.015]  And this is happening everywhere.
[00:19:31.035 --> 00:19:37.679]  We've got a clip coming up after that where we have the documents where just like the schools, the more people injected, the higher the money as they get.
[00:19:38.019 --> 00:19:39.139]  It's tied to federal funding.
[00:19:39.399 --> 00:19:40.940]  Same thing with wearing these damn masks.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.963]  Behavioral psychologist at the Rockefeller Foundation when Bill Gates came up with this crap.
[00:19:46.103 --> 00:19:46.583]  Here's the clip.
[00:19:47.307 --> 00:19:51.664]  I am here for my daughter and beyond anything else, she loves school.
[00:19:52.714 --> 00:19:55.935]  The harm you have done to her, she still loves school.
[00:19:56.396 --> 00:20:00.917]  She loves her teachers, her therapists, her helpers, above all, her principal at Scott School.
[00:20:01.358 --> 00:20:02.958]  Her team goes above and beyond for her.
[00:20:03.358 --> 00:20:05.659]  Her LBS has gone to the moon and back for her.
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.680]  She's a happy and outgoing girl.
[00:20:08.221 --> 00:20:16.544]  And the countless positive and influential people that have helped her along the way, her team and her principal at Scott School have been such great role models to her.
[00:20:17.044 --> 00:20:18.485]  Her dream is to work there someday.
[00:20:19.145 --> 00:20:24.328]  She talks nothing else than wanting to be a teacher or wanting to go to school and be in work at school.
[00:20:24.748 --> 00:20:32.311]  I can only name a few people in her life that have harmed her and actively participated in holding her back and stopping her progress.
[00:20:32.432 --> 00:20:34.753]  And almost every one of them is in this room tonight.
[00:20:35.533 --> 00:20:43.037]  The past two years have been shameful as the district has been busy lauding themselves while they enact policies that have absolutely been devastating to her group.
[00:20:43.777 --> 00:20:45.839]  We have seen two years of almost no growth.
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:46.961]  Missed goals.
[00:20:47.441 --> 00:20:48.342]  Goals removed.
[00:20:48.863 --> 00:20:50.785]  Her team is doing everything that they can.
[00:20:51.165 --> 00:20:52.387]  We've hired specialists.
[00:20:53.288 --> 00:20:54.469]  She still loves school.
[00:20:55.650 --> 00:21:01.937]  My 10-year-old daughter has kept these feelings to herself about how much she desperately wants to take her mask off.
[00:21:02.578 --> 00:21:07.859]  When we told her that it may be possible on Monday, she cried, tears.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.500]  She jumped up and down.
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.441]  She told us that she was so excited that people may finally be able to understand her.
[00:21:15.301 --> 00:21:18.262]  You have harmed her so much with this.
[00:21:19.022 --> 00:21:21.823]  Everybody talks about everybody's got to be safe.
[00:21:22.163 --> 00:21:23.524]  Everybody's got to have everything.
[00:21:23.544 --> 00:21:25.824]  And we've left so many children behind.
[00:21:27.205 --> 00:21:28.425]  We've tried to protect her.
[00:21:29.631 --> 00:21:52.489]  This morning, she got up before us and she started singing a song to her dolls about how excited she was that kids were finally going to be able to see her smile, that she was going to be able to see other kids' smiles, that kids would be able to understand her and she would stop being picked on because they could not understand her through her mask because her speech has been delayed even more than her special needs.
[00:21:55.129 --> 00:21:56.189]  She is a strong girl.
[00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:02.312]  But when I heard her do that, and I heard the things that she said, it broke me.
[00:22:03.432 --> 00:22:05.833]  I will never forgive myself for not fighting more.
[00:22:05.853 --> 00:22:09.235]  I feel that I have failed her for not fighting more.
[00:22:12.537 --> 00:22:16.718]  This district uses hashtags, be bold, next to everything.
[00:22:16.978 --> 00:22:22.300]  You continue hiding behind others instead of leading and fighting for the kids that need you the most.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.582]  You've left them behind while you say that there's no lost learning.
[00:22:27.442 --> 00:22:32.623]  The vulnerable, like my daughter, have lost and she won't get these things back.
[00:22:33.044 --> 00:22:38.585]  Her team is doing everything they can and we respect them and we'll go do anything for them.
[00:22:38.965 --> 00:22:40.086]  But you have failed them.
[00:22:41.475 --> 00:22:55.905]  On behalf of the whole board, thank you for your comments.
[00:22:56.226 --> 00:23:02.931]  I'm just going to remind all individuals in this audience and in our overflow rooms, you need to have on a mask.
[00:23:04.127 --> 00:23:06.808]  If you're a radio listener, you're lucky, because you're not a TV viewer.
[00:23:07.088 --> 00:23:08.909]  They're all wearing damn masks, including him.
[00:23:09.369 --> 00:23:10.530]  And they're all nodding and agreeing.
[00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:15.832]  They should all take their mask off and say, we want these people arrested that followed this!
[00:23:16.452 --> 00:23:17.712]  Instead of submitting!
[00:23:18.072 --> 00:23:21.794]  America wasn't built on all this cucking and crap!
[00:23:22.611 --> 00:23:27.756]  These people started a war with us, they're a bunch of behavioral psychologists, they're eugenicist pedophiles!
[00:23:28.457 --> 00:23:30.078]  Eugenics pedophiles!
[00:23:30.459 --> 00:23:31.820]  Eugenics pedophiles!
[00:23:32.101 --> 00:23:33.902]  And now they're starting nuclear war with Russia!
[00:23:34.443 --> 00:23:36.625]  These people have got to be removed!
[00:23:36.985 --> 00:23:40.209]  You know how mentally ill these psychotic behavioral psychologists are?
[00:23:40.469 --> 00:23:42.671]  And almost every damn one of them is a pedophile!
[00:23:43.091 --> 00:23:44.333]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:23:45.464 --> 00:23:48.186]  So my old buddy Joe Rogan sent me a text last night.
[00:23:48.567 --> 00:23:56.473]  Charlie Kirk was on Fox News talking about major insurance companies saying they've seen a 40% death increase in the U.S.
[00:23:56.553 --> 00:23:57.674]  and he says, is that true?
[00:23:58.014 --> 00:23:58.955]  So I just search engined it.
[00:23:58.975 --> 00:24:00.156]  Yeah, go ahead and bring me the headline, thanks.
[00:24:00.837 --> 00:24:07.482]  I went ahead and search engined it and pulled up a whole bunch of mainstream news admitting it weeks after we reported it.
[00:24:08.377 --> 00:24:09.478]  Huge, huge numbers.
[00:24:09.598 --> 00:24:16.964]  Insurance group, not just this one that manages $100 billion, sees death rate up 40% over pre-pandemic levels.
[00:24:17.985 --> 00:24:23.009]  And it's up massively last year over the year before, once the vaccine kicked in.
[00:24:25.151 --> 00:24:29.254]  So ladies and gentlemen, that's out of the Hill newspaper.
[00:24:30.006 --> 00:24:31.407]  For you, right there.
[00:24:31.487 --> 00:24:32.667]  So, yeah, that's going on.
[00:24:32.687 --> 00:24:35.588]  I'm going to play that Charlie Kirk Club coming up next segment.
[00:24:35.968 --> 00:24:37.889]  But let me just hone in on something.
[00:24:38.469 --> 00:24:45.652]  I've known Rand Paul, and I'm proud to know him, since 1996 when his father ran for Congress for the second time.
[00:24:46.012 --> 00:24:57.357]  He got in for one term in the 80s under Reagan, got mad at Reagan for doing a bunch of spending, attacked Reagan, and lost his seat because he was being a purist, which I agree with.
[00:24:57.961 --> 00:24:59.022]  Dr. No, he was called.
[00:24:59.382 --> 00:25:01.823]  He got back in 96 and you know the rest is history.
[00:25:02.263 --> 00:25:04.884]  Served for more than 20 plus years.
[00:25:05.124 --> 00:25:05.865]  Did a great job.
[00:25:06.425 --> 00:25:07.785]  So, I mean, I know Rand well.
[00:25:07.805 --> 00:25:08.606]  Know him personally.
[00:25:09.786 --> 00:25:10.927]  And know his dad personally.
[00:25:10.987 --> 00:25:11.807]  And know the family.
[00:25:12.627 --> 00:25:13.428]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[00:25:13.468 --> 00:25:14.348]  They're fellow Texans.
[00:25:16.769 --> 00:25:21.451]  But the issue here is that I know Rand Paul is as smart as I am or smarter.
[00:25:21.471 --> 00:25:22.712]  I mean, he's extremely smart.
[00:25:23.652 --> 00:25:25.713]  And he knows that this isn't a vaccine.
[00:25:26.053 --> 00:25:27.354]  He knows this isn't working.
[00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:33.271]  And he might have believed that maybe it was going to work early on, but once he saw the numbers, he needs to come out against it.
[00:25:33.291 --> 00:25:41.733]  And I said a few months ago, if he doesn't come out against this for children at least, I'm declaring war on him.
[00:25:42.853 --> 00:25:51.495]  Because I was going to declare war on Trump and was planning whole campaigns against him, was going to go to Mar-a-Lago and bullhorn him for a week, just because I like Trump.
[00:25:51.615 --> 00:25:53.635]  I want Trump to stop this killing of the kids.
[00:25:54.615 --> 00:25:55.595]  Okay, he got conned.
[00:25:55.855 --> 00:25:56.656]  He went along with it.
[00:25:57.296 --> 00:25:58.236]  Now we know it doesn't work.
[00:25:59.187 --> 00:26:00.028]  Does it protect you?
[00:26:00.429 --> 00:26:05.256]  Gives you cancer, heart attacks, blood clots, heart swelling, you know, menstrual problems.
[00:26:06.798 --> 00:26:11.826]  But I was sort of thinking, why am I so pissed at Trump when Rand Paul's a doctor that got him to do it?
[00:26:11.986 --> 00:26:13.148]  He was part of convincing him.
[00:26:14.986 --> 00:26:16.087]  And I get what Trump wanted to do.
[00:26:16.107 --> 00:26:17.087]  They were going to lock things down.
[00:26:17.107 --> 00:26:18.368]  He said, hey, let's just have this shot.
[00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:19.289]  Let's fix it.
[00:26:19.309 --> 00:26:22.331]  Because old inoculations worked because they were really inoculations.
[00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:25.193]  They might have side effects, but this is even inoculation.
[00:26:25.593 --> 00:26:27.094]  It's not a side effect to make you sick.
[00:26:27.174 --> 00:26:27.935]  It's on purpose.
[00:26:28.255 --> 00:26:29.436]  So then you don't go to work.
[00:26:29.696 --> 00:26:33.038]  So people refuse to go to work and haven't taken it to break down society.
[00:26:33.098 --> 00:26:33.318]  So.
[00:26:34.979 --> 00:26:38.202]  I don't tell you this whole Rand Paul story for no reason.
[00:26:38.582 --> 00:26:43.085]  I'm saying I went after Paul, as you know, in probably 15 broadcasts.
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.881]  In a friendly way, but a very serious way.
[00:26:46.941 --> 00:26:51.783]  Because I'm not selling out my morals just to defend the Republican Party.
[00:26:52.043 --> 00:26:53.883]  All I get is pain for supporting these guys.
[00:26:54.363 --> 00:26:56.364]  But as long as they do good things, I love the pain.
[00:26:56.804 --> 00:26:59.025]  But I'm not going to sit there while they sell us out.
[00:26:59.065 --> 00:27:00.185]  I'm going to give them pain.
[00:27:01.226 --> 00:27:02.506]  And by the way, Rand Paul's great.
[00:27:02.726 --> 00:27:05.687]  They shot at him, broke his ribs, attacked him everywhere.
[00:27:05.927 --> 00:27:07.948]  He's the real deal because they know his potential.
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:14.603]  So Paul now has come out against the injections for under 16.
[00:27:15.023 --> 00:27:17.145]  He's come out and said, really, it doesn't work anymore.
[00:27:17.506 --> 00:27:18.927]  He's kind of walked it back.
[00:27:18.987 --> 00:27:19.167]  Good.
[00:27:19.207 --> 00:27:19.688]  That's enough.
[00:27:19.728 --> 00:27:20.388]  That's all we want.
[00:27:21.369 --> 00:27:23.651]  That makes my conscience feel good and it saves a lot of people.
[00:27:24.372 --> 00:27:26.754]  Because we can't, you know, sit there and keep going along with this.
[00:27:28.796 --> 00:27:30.818]  And yes, he's coming out saying this is a fraud.
[00:27:30.838 --> 00:27:32.960]  Fauci needs to be criminally investigated.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.862]  All this stuff needs to go on.
[00:27:36.502 --> 00:27:37.102]  That's wonderful.
[00:27:37.443 --> 00:27:41.885]  So Paul's going from being a great guy to back to the hero I've always seen him as, Senator Paul.
[00:27:43.546 --> 00:27:45.267]  Then in comes all the new stuff.
[00:27:45.847 --> 00:27:51.370]  And that's him saying, Rand Paul, Dems have overplayed their hand with stupid theater, COVID madness.
[00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:52.211]  But it's not stupid.
[00:27:52.571 --> 00:27:58.034]  They made $90 billion over at Pfizer, tens of billions at the other companies, with Bill Gates invested in both.
[00:27:59.292 --> 00:28:14.076]  They're getting world IDs put in, half of Europe's under martial law, forced injections have begun, Australia and New Zealand are under martial law, Trudeau's trying to keep Canada under martial law, and we don't want them to just back off now and we all go back to sleep, then they're going to come right back.
[00:28:14.396 --> 00:28:24.179]  We want criminal investigations like he's announced in the Senate and the House that's been announced by Steve Scalise, who also got shot at the same time Paul got shot at.
[00:28:24.199 --> 00:28:24.939]  So these are great men.
[00:28:26.445 --> 00:28:32.828]  We need to go on the offense, not just say, oh, it's stupid, oh, they're dumb, oh, they're idiots, oh, we don't know why they're so stupid.
[00:28:32.968 --> 00:28:33.628]  They're not stupid.
[00:28:33.648 --> 00:28:37.610]  It's a premeditated Great Reset, New World Order, transhumanist takeover.
[00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:44.553]  Address it for what it is, rise up politically, let's defeat this agenda instead of fighting the salvos it launches at us.
[00:28:45.233 --> 00:28:48.554]  Let's defeat the evil empire of the Bilderberg Group and the Davos Group.
[00:28:48.835 --> 00:28:49.595]  Here's Senator Paul.
[00:28:51.363 --> 00:28:55.408]  Good to have you with us.
[00:28:55.888 --> 00:29:01.394]  What's your read on what's happening in Canada and another convoy that's being organized in the United States?
[00:29:01.434 --> 00:29:05.339]  What does this say to you about what's going on and what does it reflect for you?
[00:29:06.172 --> 00:29:08.253]  You know, I think it's no longer a right-left issue.
[00:29:08.293 --> 00:29:22.097]  There may have been more of us on the right not liking the government mandates, but I think now you're finding parents of children, whether they're left of center, in the center, independents, who really don't like the idea of just forcing children to wear masks when the science don't.
[00:29:22.577 --> 00:29:25.320]  It doesn't really indicate that the masks are working.
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.022]  Even the CDC admits that cloth masks aren't working.
[00:29:28.402 --> 00:29:31.485]  You see kids outside huddled in the cold eating their sandwiches.
[00:29:31.525 --> 00:29:33.667]  You see kids playing outside in masks.
[00:29:33.947 --> 00:29:35.949]  So I think it is bringing right and left together.
[00:29:35.989 --> 00:29:36.930]  I don't think it's going to.
[00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:43.076]  I think in the end, the Democrats have really overplayed their hands on the mandates because they're going to lose their populace.
[00:29:43.096 --> 00:29:44.197]  They're going to use their public.
[00:29:45.017 --> 00:29:46.538]  So I think this is a turning point.
[00:29:46.578 --> 00:29:56.505]  I think it's really getting to the point where the science is clear, that the bulk and the vast majority of the masks that people are wearing have no difference, make no difference in the trajectory of the virus.
[00:29:56.866 --> 00:30:03.050]  So yeah, I think ultimately the Democrats are going to lose the public, and if they haven't already lost the public, I think they're getting there.
[00:30:03.513 --> 00:30:03.873]  Could be.
[00:30:04.313 --> 00:30:08.035]  This photo of Stacey Abrams got a lot of attention over the weekend.
[00:30:08.075 --> 00:30:13.037]  Not only was she not wearing a mask, but she was also in front of a group of children.
[00:30:13.357 --> 00:30:18.920]  And you look at these little kids, I think we've all become maybe too used to seeing children with half of their faces covered.
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:25.243]  And she put out a statement saying, it's shameful that our opponents are using Black History Month reading event.
[00:30:25.663 --> 00:30:35.611]  For Georgia children, as an impetus for a false political attack, this pathetic, transparent and silly attack is beneath anyone who claims he wants to lead Georgia.
[00:30:36.652 --> 00:30:38.534]  Much ado about nothing or is this significant?
[00:30:39.349 --> 00:30:41.770]  I think if she were honest, she would admit that it's theater.
[00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:48.694]  I think almost all the politicians I see around the Capitol are quickly putting them on for cameras, and it really is theater.
[00:30:48.734 --> 00:30:49.194]  They know it.
[00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:50.635]  I see them in private sitting down.
[00:30:50.675 --> 00:30:51.676]  They don't have their masks on.
[00:30:52.176 --> 00:30:55.858]  I interviewed one of the nominees to head an agency for government.
[00:30:55.878 --> 00:31:00.761]  We sat and talked for 45 minutes in my office, and then they said they wanted a picture, and I said, well, sure.
[00:31:00.801 --> 00:31:02.642]  He says, you mind if I put my mask on?
[00:31:03.702 --> 00:31:05.703]  Hey, whatever floats your boat, you know?
[00:31:06.043 --> 00:31:06.703]  But I mean, it is.
[00:31:06.763 --> 00:31:08.324]  It is all theater at this point.
[00:31:08.664 --> 00:31:11.725]  And if it were just adults being stupid, that would be fine.
[00:31:11.765 --> 00:31:16.027]  You have a right to be stupid in a free country, but you don't have a right to force this on children.
[00:31:16.367 --> 00:31:17.827]  And it is really, really sad.
[00:31:17.867 --> 00:31:25.330]  And somebody's got to stand up, whether it's putting your semi in the middle of a town and honking the horn or whatever, or whether it's parents going to a school board meeting.
[00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:30.172]  These people will never let go of our freedoms or our children if we do not push back.
[00:31:30.572 --> 00:32:01.097]   It's interesting there was a study that was done or released I saw a graph that showed California versus Texas in terms of the cases and California of course has much more onerous masking rules, Texas much more open in terms of choice to mask or not and essentially California's cases were slightly higher the trend line is very similar but There's no way to read this chart other than to think that California is not at an advantage for masking up.
[00:32:01.877 --> 00:32:03.497]  Well, this is true over and over again.
[00:32:03.537 --> 00:32:11.479]  If you look at most state mandates, when they were instituted, and you look at the incidence of the disease, the incidence of the disease continues to rise after the mandates.
[00:32:11.979 --> 00:32:17.920]  In Florida, about half of the counties obeyed the order to quit the mandates when DeSantis said quit doing the mandates.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.621]  The other half kept the mandates.
[00:32:20.001 --> 00:32:21.441]  These were large numbers of children.
[00:32:21.821 --> 00:32:24.362]  The incidence between the two groups is essentially the same.
[00:32:24.723 --> 00:32:25.943]  The masks do not work.
[00:32:25.983 --> 00:32:27.564]  We are just punishing our children.
[00:32:27.924 --> 00:32:33.427]  And as someone who doesn't hear very well, I know what it's like to not be able to understand people because you can't see their lips.
[00:32:33.927 --> 00:32:35.408]  And so I think this is terrible.
[00:32:35.448 --> 00:32:40.210]  Plus kids, even kids who have normal hearing, are learning by looking at the lips and the facial expressions.
[00:32:40.711 --> 00:32:45.653]  This is how they learn to blit, to be part of a group and be part of a community.
[00:32:45.693 --> 00:32:49.255]  So I think it's really sad for these kids and somebody's got to stand up for it.
[00:32:49.375 --> 00:32:49.935]  Heartbreaking.
[00:32:49.975 --> 00:32:56.198]  And they're so, you know, compliant and obedient and they're doing what they're told and they think that this is, you know, a way of life.
[00:32:56.298 --> 00:33:06.421]  And I just wonder how long it's going to take to, you know, to free them up to live in a world where they don't have to cover half their faces, especially with cloth masks, which as you say, the CDC say really doesn't do anything.
[00:33:07.282 --> 00:33:08.682]  Thank you very much, Senator Paul.
[00:33:08.782 --> 00:33:09.703]  Always good to talk to you, sir.
[00:33:11.203 --> 00:33:12.084]  Freedom, folks!
[00:33:13.084 --> 00:33:15.084]  Freedom!
[00:33:15.084 --> 00:33:17.084]  Freedom!
[00:33:17.084 --> 00:33:19.084]  Freedom!
[00:33:19.084 --> 00:33:21.084]  That's all there is.
[00:33:21.084 --> 00:33:21.923]  There is.
[00:33:22.251 --> 00:33:22.852]  There ain't freedom.
[00:33:22.872 --> 00:33:23.332]  There's nothing.
[00:33:24.311 --> 00:33:31.311]  Freedom!
[00:33:31.311 --> 00:33:32.670]  Gentlemen, we are back.
[00:33:32.615 --> 00:33:33.675]  And I mentioned this.
[00:33:33.975 --> 00:33:34.735]  I'm unnamed, Robin.
[00:33:34.755 --> 00:33:36.156]  It just shows how awake Joe Rogan is.
[00:33:36.756 --> 00:33:38.496]  He sends me a link last night, and he goes, is this real?
[00:33:38.896 --> 00:33:42.177]  I sent him back a bunch of articles, The Hill, Zero Hedge, Infowars.
[00:33:42.197 --> 00:33:44.798]  But the insurance company guy went on, Namescreen TV.
[00:33:45.158 --> 00:33:54.247]   He manages a $100 billion company, and then it turns out A whole big group of insurance companies are finding similar numbers, also in Europe, also in Australia, all over the place.
[00:33:54.887 --> 00:33:55.968]  Everywhere you're getting the shots.
[00:33:56.328 --> 00:33:57.389]  And the numbers weren't there in 2020.
[00:33:57.429 --> 00:34:00.370]  There was a little bit of extra death, but not much.
[00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:03.572]  But when the shots start in 2021, it explodes.
[00:34:05.354 --> 00:34:06.955]  That is absolutely insane.
[00:34:07.455 --> 00:34:08.716]  Here's Charlie Kirk talking about it.
[00:34:09.656 --> 00:34:11.097]  Charlie Kirk, thanks so much for coming on.
[00:34:11.197 --> 00:34:11.678]  What is this?
[00:34:13.302 --> 00:34:13.782]  We don't know.
[00:34:13.802 --> 00:34:18.627]  I mean, the one business that actually tells the truth regarding the death of Americans is life insurance.
[00:34:18.987 --> 00:34:20.108]  They have to get this right.
[00:34:20.128 --> 00:34:23.251]  They have entire teams of actuaries that study this data all day long.
[00:34:23.591 --> 00:34:25.593]  It's not the public health authorities that are warning this.
[00:34:25.693 --> 00:34:31.818]  It's a single CEO of a major life insurance company that says, hey, by the way, there's kind of a 40% increase in death.
[00:34:32.759 --> 00:34:35.941]  10%, he said, would be a once in 200 year catastrophe.
[00:34:35.962 --> 00:34:37.743]  We have a 40% increase in death.
[00:34:38.223 --> 00:34:39.304]  And it's not because of COVID.
[00:34:39.825 --> 00:34:41.006]  And we deserve answers.
[00:34:41.206 --> 00:34:46.190]  And what's so amazing, Tucker, is that we've known this information and this data for a couple weeks now.
[00:34:46.871 --> 00:34:47.971]  Where are the politicians?
[00:34:48.031 --> 00:34:48.752]  Where are the leaders?
[00:34:48.772 --> 00:34:53.276]  Where are the people we put in charge to actually care about the well-being of our people?
[00:34:53.556 --> 00:34:58.300]  Well, at least we know how many times Joe Rogan used a bad word in a podcast the last 10 years.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:07.307]  I guess we're getting our pronouns right for our six-year-olds, but we have a 40% increase in death amongst the supposed healthiest portion of the American population.
[00:35:07.627 --> 00:35:08.588]  This is a catastrophe.
[00:35:08.948 --> 00:35:16.092]  We deserve answers, and some would conjecture, hey, does this have something to do with the fact that we might have done a mass inoculation strategy?
[00:35:16.132 --> 00:35:21.434]  We know that there was deaths of alienation, suicide, and otherwise, but there's no answers.
[00:35:21.514 --> 00:35:22.274]  No one's talking about it.
[00:35:22.935 --> 00:35:26.597]  So, I mean, isn't this the primary number they should be focused on?
[00:35:26.637 --> 00:35:36.518]   If you're in charge of the well-being of the American people and the death rate jumps by 40% in a cohort, You know, that's not supposed to die young.
[00:35:36.538 --> 00:35:40.345]  Then, like, why aren't you hair-on-fire upset about it?
[00:35:41.086 --> 00:35:42.108]  I'm honestly confused.
[00:35:43.442 --> 00:35:52.784]  Well, it's either they don't care, or they don't know how to talk about it, or they are too concerned about GDP numbers, or stock market increases, or immigration quotas, or whatever.
[00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:54.084]  It's a mass casualty event.
[00:35:54.164 --> 00:35:54.884]  It's that simple.
[00:35:55.464 --> 00:36:04.786]  And the fact that the insurance companies are now warning us about it should have every politician, every political party across the country say, regardless of your politics, we've got to figure out what's going on here.
[00:36:05.046 --> 00:36:08.346]  The lockdown's contributed, and there's other things that definitely contributed as well.
[00:36:08.646 --> 00:36:11.227]  This is probably the most important metric for our leaders to care about.
[00:36:11.707 --> 00:36:12.887]  Well, that's exactly right.
[00:36:13.108 --> 00:36:14.868]  And they don't care.
[00:36:15.148 --> 00:36:20.070]  And I just really am grateful that you noticed this, so it went over my head and brought it to us tonight.
[00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:20.890]  Charlie Kirk, thank you.
[00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.771]  Thank you.
[00:36:22.831 --> 00:36:30.054]  Yeah, Charlie Kirk is really, now that everybody's waking up, and I guess he feels safe to tell the truth, he's more articulate than I am most of the time.
[00:36:30.614 --> 00:36:31.654]  And he sounds like Alex Jones 2.0.
[00:36:32.194 --> 00:36:33.415]  That's really great news.
[00:36:33.995 --> 00:36:47.053]   Yeah, Pfizer quietly adds language, this is two days ago, warning that unfavorable preclinical Clinical or safety data is coming out that's going to kill their stock and the stock is plunging two days after they put that out.
[00:36:48.047 --> 00:36:54.128]  Oh, and they lied about the numbers of Americans that took the shot or any of these poison so-called vaccines.
[00:36:54.188 --> 00:36:55.788]  It's more like 50% like we told you.
[00:36:56.369 --> 00:36:59.049]  As we had sources inside, it's not 70, 80% like Biden said.
[00:36:59.069 --> 00:37:02.170]  By the way, it's the same thing for Europe and other places.
[00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:04.410]  Oh, it's the same thing for Israel, too.
[00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.970]  They're more like 65%.
[00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.931]  I mean, they did submit more than we did.
[00:37:07.951 --> 00:37:11.411]  Oh, and notice they have the highest rate of deaths over there.
[00:37:12.272 --> 00:37:14.032]  And they're on to their fourth and fifth shots now.
[00:37:15.273 --> 00:37:18.895]  So this is a big, big, big, big deal.
[00:37:19.115 --> 00:37:26.379]  Let's hear from Scott Davidson, the actual head of the large insurance conglomerate.
[00:37:26.419 --> 00:37:26.739]  Here it is.
[00:37:27.697 --> 00:37:32.801]  One of our businesses is that we offer group life and disability insurance to employers.
[00:37:33.802 --> 00:37:40.308]  And we are seeing right now the highest death rates we have ever seen in the history of this business, not just at One America.
[00:37:40.748 --> 00:37:45.772]  The data is consistent across every player in that business.
[00:37:45.832 --> 00:37:57.865]   Now, this is primarily working age people, 18 to 64, that are in employers like All the employers on the screen here and what we saw just in third quarter.
[00:37:57.885 --> 00:37:59.787]  We're seeing it continue into fourth quarter.
[00:38:00.328 --> 00:38:09.780]  Is that death rates are up 40% over what they were pre pandemic just to give you a an idea of how bad that is.
[00:38:10.641 --> 00:38:19.327]  A three-sigma or a one-in-200-year catastrophe would be 10% increase over pre-pandemic.
[00:38:19.487 --> 00:38:20.488]  Hit pause.
[00:38:20.768 --> 00:38:23.090]  I looked the numbers up when this came out a month ago and we harped on it.
[00:38:26.432 --> 00:38:27.993]  World War II didn't cause this number.
[00:38:29.274 --> 00:38:31.956]  World War I killed three or four times more U.S.
[00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:32.256]  troops.
[00:38:32.436 --> 00:38:33.757]  Didn't have that number.
[00:38:36.519 --> 00:38:37.059]  Didn't have that.
[00:38:37.079 --> 00:38:39.561]  You understand, this is massive.
[00:38:40.419 --> 00:38:41.400]  In young people.
[00:38:42.701 --> 00:38:44.422]  And it's not COVID, that's why they don't want you to know.
[00:38:44.442 --> 00:38:46.543]  I mean, they hit us, folks.
[00:38:46.703 --> 00:38:50.466]  We tried to get out of the New World Order, and they released a virus, and then hit us with a shot.
[00:38:51.467 --> 00:38:53.308]  Five times, six times worse than the virus.
[00:38:53.888 --> 00:38:55.229]  On average, I've had top scientists on.
[00:38:55.950 --> 00:39:03.235]  The amount of spike protein it creates in you is five to six times, well, if you average all of them together with the actuaries.
[00:39:03.895 --> 00:39:05.917]  Moderna, it's eight to nine times worse.
[00:39:10.663 --> 00:39:13.485]  Oh, and the discoverer of HIV who just died.
[00:39:14.125 --> 00:39:15.866]  He just died yesterday.
[00:39:16.386 --> 00:39:23.730]  He came out last year, or a year and a half ago actually, in 2020 and said, this is going to cause autoimmune disorder to explode.
[00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:24.651]  They're going to say it's HIV.
[00:39:24.671 --> 00:39:26.472]  Because it is HIV.
[00:39:27.913 --> 00:39:31.535]  And baby, it's now HIV off the chart.
[00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:33.836]  I mean, we are being murdered right now.
[00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:38.232]  There's a really powerful article by Gateway Pundit out today.
[00:39:38.833 --> 00:39:39.634]  Here's the list.
[00:39:40.034 --> 00:39:48.282]  1,000 different studies show extensive evidence of COVID-19 vaccine adverse events.
[00:39:48.842 --> 00:39:50.985]  Let's finish up with the CEO of One America.
[00:39:51.005 --> 00:39:52.966]  And again, it's a consortium.
[00:39:52.986 --> 00:39:54.308]  It owns close to us.
[00:39:55.535 --> 00:40:00.338]  I was looking at a list of 50-something insurance companies in the MLI, if you know all that stuff.
[00:40:00.879 --> 00:40:02.580]  Here it is.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:08.664]  A 200-year catastrophe would be a 10% increase over pre-pandemic.
[00:40:09.225 --> 00:40:12.247]  So 40% is just unheard of.
[00:40:12.767 --> 00:40:25.296]   And what the data is showing us is that the deaths that are being reported as COVID deaths Greatly understate the actual death losses among working-age people from the pandemic.
[00:40:25.396 --> 00:40:31.640]  It may not all be COVID on their death certificate, but deaths are up just a huge, huge numbers.
[00:40:32.621 --> 00:40:36.324]  We're also seeing an uptick in disability claims.
[00:40:36.864 --> 00:40:40.967]  At first it was short-term disability claims, and now we're seeing... Okay, so let's stop right there.
[00:40:41.607 --> 00:40:46.791]  There was a worldwide move against the globalists, kicking the globalists out with populists, and they hit us with a bioweapon.
[00:40:48.132 --> 00:40:57.260]  And then when you take the shot to supposedly protect yourself, well, you now are growing a deadly spike protein in your body.
[00:40:58.701 --> 00:41:00.883]  So the sick joke is it's taking your body over.
[00:41:01.183 --> 00:41:05.546]  So yeah, you're not going to catch COVID for five, six months until spike protein goes back down.
[00:41:05.847 --> 00:41:08.629]  But during that period, it's running around eating holes in you.
[00:41:09.994 --> 00:41:19.960]  So it's kind of like you cut one leg off and you're bleeding to death, and instead of putting a tourniquet around it, you cut the other one off, because it'll actually make the other leg not bleed as much, but it doesn't matter, you just cut the other leg off.
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:20.581]  Does that make sense?
[00:41:22.962 --> 00:41:25.464]  This was so sickly and evilly thought up.
[00:41:25.824 --> 00:41:26.925]  I'm going to go to break and come back.
[00:41:27.145 --> 00:41:27.485]  We've got...
[00:41:28.928 --> 00:41:32.989]  The dictator of Canada's brother joining us is his biological brother.
[00:41:33.009 --> 00:41:35.730]  It's going to be a huge interview next hour and so much more today.
[00:41:36.111 --> 00:41:48.515]  But just remember listeners, we can't be tip of the spear and tell you about this stuff four or five weeks ago, and then now you see it on Tucker, and then you'll see it everywhere, and then you'll see the CEOs of these companies probably arrested at the end of the day, like Pfizer.
[00:41:48.535 --> 00:41:49.455]  I mean, it's going that way.
[00:41:49.675 --> 00:41:50.556]  We are winning right now.
[00:41:51.616 --> 00:41:53.577]  We are winning right now, but it's very close.
[00:41:54.764 --> 00:41:55.444]  I need your support.
[00:41:55.805 --> 00:41:56.765]  And I got stuff you need.
[00:41:56.785 --> 00:41:59.646]  I told them a week ago, get rid of the sale because it's going to sell out.
[00:41:59.706 --> 00:42:01.127]  But they didn't get rid of the multivitamin sale.
[00:42:01.147 --> 00:42:01.848]  I'm not mad at the crew.
[00:42:02.268 --> 00:42:11.132]  They didn't get rid of the vitamin C, zinc, rosehip, super pill, super strong, Linus Pauling level, 1100% of organic vitamin C and more.
[00:42:11.512 --> 00:42:12.273]  So that's also 40% off.
[00:42:12.293 --> 00:42:14.854]  It means it's going to sell out by next week.
[00:42:14.914 --> 00:42:18.076]  I was going to keep it a few months until more came in, but we're just going to sell out of that.
[00:42:18.096 --> 00:42:18.676]  We need the funds.
[00:42:19.844 --> 00:42:20.945]  X3 is back in stock.
[00:42:21.085 --> 00:42:22.126]  It is 50% off.
[00:42:22.166 --> 00:42:22.926]  It's so incredible.
[00:42:22.946 --> 00:42:25.268]  If you're not taking true iodine, you're just crazy.
[00:42:25.308 --> 00:42:26.269]  And it's back in stock now.
[00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:27.530]  Nobody else has got something like this.
[00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:28.971]  We have the only tri-iodine out there.
[00:42:29.411 --> 00:42:30.131]  It's 50% off.

[00:42:36.036 --> 00:42:37.377]  If you pay five times more, get something better.
[00:42:37.397 --> 00:42:42.220]  Yeah, but for good quality, clean, tasty food, this is the lowest price you're going to find anywhere.
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.521]  And this is what I use for my family.
[00:42:43.781 --> 00:42:45.122]  They haven't done 25% off in four years.

[00:43:00.924 --> 00:43:02.546]  No, but it's part of the way of getting there.
[00:43:03.207 --> 00:43:03.968]  Jesus will save you.
[00:43:04.008 --> 00:43:04.889]  This will get you prepared.
[00:43:05.309 --> 00:43:07.352]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[00:43:07.192 --> 00:43:08.751]  I'd get ahold of this.
[00:43:08.751 --> 00:43:12.192]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:43:12.192 --> 00:43:16.231]  Sold out for months.
[00:43:16.231 --> 00:43:19.550]  X3 is now back in stock.
[00:43:18.942 --> 00:43:23.044]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing.
[00:43:23.124 --> 00:43:26.405]  And so many people are deficient in iodine.
[00:43:26.445 --> 00:43:27.706]  It's not in the soil anymore.
[00:43:28.326 --> 00:43:29.867]  Most of it in the ocean is contaminated.
[00:43:30.347 --> 00:43:40.831]   But when you get high-quality tri-iodine, all three of the healthy types together, It does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly, your immune system.

[00:43:56.578 --> 00:43:58.279]  You really need to experience X3.
[00:43:58.299 --> 00:44:01.482]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.

[00:44:15.474 --> 00:44:19.618]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:31.018]  Coming up, we have the Canadian Prime Minister's brother joining us to talk about what it's like to be a Canadian, to see this tyranny, but also see Canada as an example worldwide of standing up to evil.
[00:44:31.598 --> 00:44:34.320]  But here's the live show feed headline for today.
[00:44:35.641 --> 00:44:36.602]  World exclusive!
[00:44:37.383 --> 00:44:46.750]  Globalists only planning to pause lockdowns, mask mandates, forced injections long enough until large crowds disappear.
[00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:57.754]   This is a tried and true globalist Strategy, they exploit their narrative control and the attention span of the masses to slowly but surely get what they want.
[00:44:58.815 --> 00:45:04.238]  Only by being aware of their lies and playing a long-term game can we defeat them.
[00:45:04.778 --> 00:45:14.143]  Also, Justin Trudeau's brother is joining us live on air to discuss the dictatorship now being established by his siblings controllers.
[00:45:15.084 --> 00:45:16.805]  So that is coming up.
[00:45:17.998 --> 00:45:22.881]  Next segment, but I want to play a clip, just a short clip from Tucker Carlson.
[00:45:25.082 --> 00:45:27.743]  And I'll get more into this in the third hour on this crack pipe thing.
[00:45:28.164 --> 00:45:31.846]  You know, I saw this crack pipe thing on Monday during the show.
[00:45:33.046 --> 00:45:34.007]  No, it was before the show.
[00:45:34.527 --> 00:45:35.948]  And I didn't believe it at first.
[00:45:35.988 --> 00:45:36.628]  I went and looked at it.
[00:45:36.668 --> 00:45:38.209]  I mentioned it on air and said, this is just crazy.
[00:45:38.809 --> 00:45:41.751]  And then it started breaking in the news Tuesday, Wednesday, and now Thursday.
[00:45:43.542 --> 00:45:46.284]  But this is the type of story that can really wake people up.
[00:45:46.364 --> 00:45:55.211]  This is the type of thing that will really, I call it a Rosetta Stone or a skeleton key, that if you understand this, you understand it all.
[00:45:56.772 --> 00:46:19.588]   I mean, the Babylon Bee had a headline out today that $30 billion or $20 billion, I forget the exact number, of hypothetical money is going to be given by the Biden administration to white Urban soccer moms in wine glasses so they can drink out of safe wine glasses.
[00:46:20.928 --> 00:46:32.774]  Now, given $30 million of crack pipes that they say are assigned to black people is as insane as saying we're going to give white soccer moms wine glasses.
[00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:36.900]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:46:37.221 --> 00:46:42.889]  And all over the Western world, they're now putting crack pipes in vending machines because the government's shipping this crap in, folks.
[00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:44.311]  They want you using it.
[00:46:44.652 --> 00:46:46.014]  It's all selectively enforced.
[00:46:46.675 --> 00:46:47.195]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:46:47.216 --> 00:46:48.197]  There's the headline right there.
[00:46:48.237 --> 00:46:49.259]  Biden administration.
[00:46:50.888 --> 00:46:54.851]  Announce this new program to give white suburban women free wine glasses.
[00:46:55.352 --> 00:46:57.234]  Now that's a joke, but this isn't a joke.
[00:46:57.794 --> 00:47:03.759]  And I made the point of like, imagine if you walked up to random black people and said, here, I've got watermelon for you.
[00:47:03.939 --> 00:47:07.623]  At least that doesn't kill them, but that's a very racist thing, very stereotypical.
[00:47:07.863 --> 00:47:09.464]  But this is a, oh no, you're black?
[00:47:09.784 --> 00:47:11.466]  You need 30 million in crack pipes.
[00:47:12.147 --> 00:47:13.428]  Here's Tucker Carlson talking about it.
[00:47:14.713 --> 00:47:16.573]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson.
[00:47:16.593 --> 00:47:18.154]  Tonight we've got news for you this evening.
[00:47:18.194 --> 00:47:23.275]  Joe Biden, the president, has announced another piece of his highly promoted equity agenda.
[00:47:23.755 --> 00:47:27.136]  That's the government-wide effort to improve the lives of African Americans.
[00:47:27.536 --> 00:47:35.838]  You may recall that on his first day in office more than a year ago, the new president explained that equity will require determination and creativity, and this week he proved that's true.
[00:47:36.378 --> 00:47:40.139]  Joe Biden's latest idea is to pay black people to smoke more crack.
[00:47:40.939 --> 00:47:50.569]  Going forward, the administration will send at least $30 million in tax money to nonprofits and local governments so they can purchase, quote, safe smoking kits and supplies.
[00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:59.778]  According to HHS, these kits will contain Joe Biden-approved pipes that will allow beneficiaries of the equity agenda to smoke crack cocaine as well as crystal meth.
[00:48:00.788 --> 00:48:01.888]  Some say it's about time.
[00:48:02.608 --> 00:48:10.491]  Soros-aligned NGOs have long complained that marginalized groups in this country don't have adequate access to illegal narcotics or the tools to use them.
[00:48:11.071 --> 00:48:14.412]  With this new program, Joe Biden will finally close the crack gap.
[00:48:15.032 --> 00:48:19.493]  For too long in America, quality crack pipes have been the domain of rich white men, like so much else.
[00:48:19.633 --> 00:48:23.274]  Here's the President's son, for example, smoking crack in bed at the Four Seasons.
[00:48:23.874 --> 00:48:26.636]  You'll notice the beautifully designed custom crack pipe.
[00:48:27.056 --> 00:48:30.879]  It's cooling bowl nestled in the high thread count Egyptian cotton sheets.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.101]  When Hunter Biden smokes crack, he does it in style.
[00:48:34.682 --> 00:48:36.823]  But not everyone in this country is so fortunate.
[00:48:37.384 --> 00:48:41.567]  Try to toast some rock in West Baltimore sometime, you may have to make the pipe yourself.
[00:48:42.067 --> 00:48:46.591]  From tin foil or a broken car antenna, our inner cities are pipes sold.
[00:48:46.831 --> 00:48:51.074]  Here we are in the second hour of this live Thursday, February 10th transmission.
[00:48:51.866 --> 00:49:03.651]  And we have the biological brother of the Prime Minister of Canada joining us right now to talk about this incredible situation the eyes of the world are focused on.
[00:49:05.592 --> 00:49:18.357]  The small fringe minority of people who are on their way to Ottawa or who are holding unacceptable views that they're expressing.
[00:49:20.236 --> 00:49:37.882]  Do not represent the views of Canadians who have been there for each other, who know that following the science and stepping up to protect each other is the best way to continue to ensure our freedoms, our rights, our values as a country.
[00:49:38.242 --> 00:49:45.105]  We are not intimidated by those who hurl insults and abuse at small business workers.
[00:49:46.109 --> 00:49:48.730]  and steal food from the homeless.
[00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:53.672]  We won't give in to those who fly racist flags.
[00:49:54.612 --> 00:50:01.575]  We won't cave to those who engage in vandalism or dishonor the memory of our veterans.
[00:50:02.155 --> 00:50:06.236]  So to those responsible for this behavior, it needs to stop.
[00:50:06.616 --> 00:50:16.347]   The level of admiration I actually have for China Um, because they're, you know, basic dictatorship.
[00:50:17.128 --> 00:50:33.238]  Regardless of the fact that we are attacking your fundamental rights, or limiting your fundamental rights, and the Charter says that's wrong, we're still going to go ahead and do with it.
[00:50:33.258 --> 00:50:39.002]  You know, you grow up, and if you're a history buff like I am, you read about Stalin and Hitler and Mao, and you think, how do they put up with that?
[00:50:40.508 --> 00:50:48.215]  And then you watch what our country's done, invading Iraq and murdering all these innocent people, and just all the lies, and you go, wow, we're pretty evil, too.
[00:50:48.235 --> 00:50:49.516]  I mean, at least our rulers are.
[00:50:49.536 --> 00:50:52.638]  And if we don't do something about them, that means we're guilty.
[00:50:53.319 --> 00:50:57.082]  Well, the Canadians, I've always compared them to the nicest people I've ever known, Midwesterners.
[00:50:57.903 --> 00:51:01.786]  Folks always said, Texans are really nice, and they are nice, unless you cross them.
[00:51:01.806 --> 00:51:05.769]  But Midwesterners seem really friendly and nice, and the Canadians all know have been crazy nice.
[00:51:06.129 --> 00:51:07.010]  The cliché's true.
[00:51:07.491 --> 00:51:14.126]   And then you can only be nice to Too far until it gets to a point until you're destroying yourself.
[00:51:14.166 --> 00:51:17.487]  So Canada has been so subservient for two years under tyranny.
[00:51:17.868 --> 00:51:23.510]  Now they are standing up peacefully, doing it right all over their country, not just in the capital in Ottawa.
[00:51:23.911 --> 00:51:24.851]  And it's a beautiful thing.
[00:51:24.891 --> 00:51:27.252]  And then I saw an interview for the first time.
[00:51:28.273 --> 00:51:29.473]  It's starting to break and go viral.
[00:51:29.513 --> 00:51:30.194]  Didn't know about him.
[00:51:31.514 --> 00:51:36.677]  With Kyle Kemper, who's the half brother of the current leader of Canada.
[00:51:37.381 --> 00:51:45.976]  And so I checked him out, and indeed, they've got the same mother, they know each other, and I thought, why not get a Canadian on, who also happens to be the brother of Justin Trudeau?
[00:51:47.065 --> 00:51:51.948]  To talk about the Great Reset and Klaus Schwab and what it's like being up there and just his perspective.
[00:51:51.988 --> 00:51:59.352]  So he's a father, entrepreneur, advisor, writer, mentor, connector, problem solver, activator, and critical thinker.
[00:51:59.692 --> 00:52:05.575]  Kyle first tuned into the Alex Jones Show following his epic bullhorning of the BDB meeting, the Bilderberg meeting in Ottawa.
[00:52:05.715 --> 00:52:08.317]  That's who runs his brother, way back in the day.
[00:52:08.357 --> 00:52:09.958]  And by the way, the same group tried to hire me.
[00:52:09.998 --> 00:52:13.180]  I mean, I had the Kissinger Group invite me to do what his brother did.
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:15.521]  It's crazy.
[00:52:16.442 --> 00:52:18.224]  He's the half-brother of Justin Trudeau.
[00:52:18.244 --> 00:52:22.747]  He's on Twitter at Kyle Kemper and loveandfreedomshow.com.
[00:52:23.087 --> 00:52:25.389]  So, Kyle, great to have you on with us.
[00:52:25.729 --> 00:52:26.350]  Thank you so much.
[00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:27.471]  Where do you want to start, brother?
[00:52:29.503 --> 00:52:33.484]  I just want to first give you some credit and gratitude, Alex.
[00:52:34.604 --> 00:52:45.126]  I really appreciate all the hard work that you've been doing over the years towards awakening people to the truth, and I also want to wish you a happy birthday in advance.
[00:52:45.666 --> 00:52:46.427]  Well, thank you, brother.
[00:52:46.467 --> 00:52:47.307]  It's great to have you here.
[00:52:47.527 --> 00:52:51.188]  There's so much to talk about, and where do you want to start?
[00:52:51.208 --> 00:52:52.948]  Because all eyes are on Canada worldwide.
[00:52:54.195 --> 00:53:23.909]   Well, I'd like to say that what's taking place in Canada is we've seen two years of Fear and oppression and watching our rights and our fundamental rights be taken away through a highly coordinated sophisticated media campaign brought to us by the corporatocracy using fear as a means to control people presenting hope as the idea of this fake vaccine is going to be the solution
[00:53:24.709 --> 00:53:26.411]  And, you know, enough is enough.
[00:53:26.551 --> 00:53:33.396]  Many Canadians succumbed to it, and they watched their rights and freedoms continue to be pressed and stressed.
[00:53:34.557 --> 00:53:55.442]   And now, you know, they've awoke the truckers, and the truckers represent a spearhead that Canadians are uniting under just like the mass psychosis where, you know, people were lost and didn't know where to go and have been channeling their hate towards, you know, the unvaccinated.
[00:53:55.462 --> 00:54:00.386]  The same thing is happening here with people haven't had any path forward or any hope.
[00:54:00.426 --> 00:54:01.307]  And in Canada, too.
[00:54:01.327 --> 00:54:08.393]  I mean, it's been there's been a lack of human connection and love and basic humanity.
[00:54:08.553 --> 00:54:09.634]  People have been demoralized.
[00:54:09.915 --> 00:54:19.821]   But now there's this great Occurrence that's happened where Canadians of all backgrounds are coming together with one word in mind, and that word is freedom.
[00:54:20.361 --> 00:54:25.004]  And what's taking place in Ottawa right now is truly incredible.
[00:54:25.524 --> 00:54:31.007]  I heard those words that, you know, Justin was saying, and they do not reflect what's actually going on the ground.
[00:54:31.727 --> 00:54:38.851]  With our show, the Love and Freedom Show, we've been live streaming and talking to truckers and going out in the streets and interviewing people.
[00:54:40.672 --> 00:54:46.073]  It's more like, I don't know, it's almost like a festival, I'd say.
[00:54:46.153 --> 00:54:49.414]  I kind of call it Freezing Man, because it's like Burning Man North.
[00:54:49.814 --> 00:54:58.857]  People are working together, it's super clean, the vibration is high, and there's a clear message that is love and freedom and unity.
[00:54:59.137 --> 00:55:15.675]   It's non-violent, there are provocateurs who are trying to encourage violence and encourage negative behavior, but this group is really well-grounded and passionate about freedom
[00:55:15.675 --> 00:55:23.556]   and they're not, and the whole world is watching and I feel like this is a major, major happening
[00:55:23.556 --> 00:55:32.394]   and I feel a personal duty to speak out and stand up for Canadians.
[00:55:32.394 --> 00:55:34.076]  Well, Kyle, it is beautiful what's happening.
[00:55:34.076 --> 00:55:36.456]  It's one of the places we said, "Why is Canada asleep?"
[00:55:36.456 --> 00:55:38.514]  and now it's leading everybody out of this.
[00:55:38.514 --> 00:55:40.755]  All the world, a great example of chain reaction.
[00:55:40.755 --> 00:55:45.635]   Two big things they're mad about, I've noticed in the Canadian controlled state-run press.
[00:55:45.635 --> 00:55:49.755]   They're mad that it's a very diverse crowd and they're mad that there's children,
[00:55:49.755 --> 00:55:51.556]  like, "Oh, these are human shields."
[00:55:51.245 --> 00:56:02.169]  No, people brought their children, and so they're having trouble assaulting it with riot police, because the symbol is now the pink bouncy castle, not the made-up Nazi swastikas that your brother's talking about.
[00:56:03.257 --> 00:56:18.021]  Bouncy castles and you know I was speaking to a trucker all the letters of love and support that all of them have like every single trucker has a box full of handwritten letters from children and passionate Canadians.
[00:56:18.481 --> 00:56:26.623]  I look at like my inboxes and they are just full of messages of love and support and yearning for freedom.
[00:56:27.263 --> 00:56:30.246]  And also there's a lot of anger out there.
[00:56:30.346 --> 00:56:36.612]  And I think one of the other angles that they're really pushing with this is this F Trudeau kind of narrative.
[00:56:36.632 --> 00:56:37.453]  And I get it.
[00:56:37.853 --> 00:56:39.915]  I get that people are really angry.
[00:56:40.035 --> 00:56:45.641]  But I'd rather have stopped the Great Reset, stop the world lockdown, free humanity, investigate gain of function.
[00:56:45.661 --> 00:56:45.981]  Exactly.
[00:56:46.001 --> 00:56:49.324]  I don't think we should just make it about your brother or Biden or any of these front guys.
[00:56:50.864 --> 00:56:52.564]  Is that what you're about to say?
[00:56:52.564 --> 00:56:55.924]   I think we should make it about the evil agenda and bring all of humanity together,
[00:56:55.924 --> 00:56:59.803]   not make it about your brother, not make it about the puppets.
[00:56:59.803 --> 00:57:04.664]   And more than anything, too, is what is our ideal outcome of this, Alex?
[00:57:04.664 --> 00:57:09.223]   That's something I want to ask you because you are so powerful in portraying
[00:57:09.223 --> 00:57:11.444]  and kind of manifesting.
[00:57:11.444 --> 00:57:14.444]  You're a seed, like what you're building and creating.
[00:57:14.444 --> 00:57:15.844]  What is our ideal outcome?
[00:57:15.844 --> 00:57:21.723]   I mean, I know it's like freedom is what we want, but I also recognize we're in this age transition
[00:57:21.723 --> 00:57:25.284]  where the old systems will not port into the new ones.
[00:57:25.284 --> 00:57:26.123]  So it's time for us to--
[00:57:26.123 --> 00:57:27.763]  I think the goal is this, let's talk about that, brother.
[00:57:27.763 --> 00:57:32.723]   We want a peaceful transition into out of the fourth turning into the fourth era.
[00:57:32.723 --> 00:57:38.337]   And we don't want to have a big giant war We want the old elites to know, hey, we're not going to kill you.
[00:57:38.437 --> 00:57:39.577]  You can even keep your stolen wealth.
[00:57:39.597 --> 00:57:40.698]  Just stop trying to kill us.
[00:57:41.218 --> 00:57:41.778]  And stop it.
[00:57:42.218 --> 00:57:48.700]  I think the goal is a global awakening, what you just said, and a transcendence just by we're not going to be part of this that we see coming out of Canada.
[00:57:50.481 --> 00:57:52.461]  Nothing can stop the great awakening of humanity.
[00:57:52.601 --> 00:57:52.861]  Wow.
[00:57:53.322 --> 00:57:54.462]  So we're definitely dialed in.
[00:57:54.702 --> 00:57:55.222]  And that's it.
[00:57:55.702 --> 00:57:57.663]  Don't let them derail our great awakening.
[00:57:58.283 --> 00:58:05.380]   And don't let the old corrupt evil forces Because the other, last stage wasn't evil, but what's left trying to hold on to it's evil.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:15.987]  And it needs to go, just turn loose and just say, hey, just like David Rockefeller turned loose, Bill Gates, Henry Kissinger, Queen of England, Prince Charles, just turn loose.
[00:58:16.648 --> 00:58:17.808]  You're not going to control us.
[00:58:18.229 --> 00:58:18.869]  Just give up.
[00:58:18.929 --> 00:58:19.890]  We don't want to destroy you.
[00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:21.491]  Stop trying to destroy us.
[00:58:21.911 --> 00:58:25.814]  We'll be right back with Kyle Kemper, an impressive fellow with loveandfreedomshow.com.
[00:58:25.834 --> 00:58:26.274]  Stay with us.
[00:58:27.175 --> 00:58:34.175]  Listen to that sound of freedom.
[00:58:34.175 --> 00:58:48.255]   Hollywood, Stanley Kubrick with all his mastery, could not come up with a sound, all the production staff,
[00:58:48.255 --> 00:58:50.255]  and all the orchestras in the world, that eerie.
[00:58:50.255 --> 00:59:00.254]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:58:52.423 --> 00:59:08.713]  I sat there in my office at home that's got a high-def stereo hooked into a turntable I've got that I listen to records on sometimes and I plugged that into the digital input and played it and like I was listening to different clips for like an hour the other day and it's just like it's so eerie.
[00:59:09.415 --> 00:59:16.403]  I don't know if over AM radio or FM radio you can hear that, but you've got to go out and find the music that they're making.
[00:59:16.423 --> 00:59:17.263]  And it's like a warning.
[00:59:17.304 --> 00:59:19.326]  It's like, it's like this.
[00:59:19.406 --> 00:59:19.986]  It's over.
[00:59:20.427 --> 00:59:27.234]  And it's all these thousands and thousands of people with different horns and different sounds coming together and echoing in those buildings.
[00:59:28.175 --> 00:59:40.916]   And I see the projection The most classical inversion by the Ottawa City Council people and by the Prime Minister, saying, you're holding us hostage, you're not letting us leave our homes, you're bankrupting us.
[00:59:41.277 --> 00:59:51.101]  When this is, truckers told, you must take these experimental shots and be tracked everywhere you go with this app in live time, where you travel and go, or we won't let you have your job.
[00:59:51.121 --> 00:59:56.343]  And they're saying, no, we're going to come protest, which is the most basic thing of any free society.
[00:59:57.546 --> 01:00:04.061]  And all these leftist operatives and graduates of the Deimos Group literally say, we need paramilitary!
[01:00:05.233 --> 01:00:09.315]  They're terrorists, they're seditionists, they're traitors, they're guilty of treason.
[01:00:09.516 --> 01:00:15.779]  These are all words, and not just the Canadian news, but the French news, and the British news, and the German news, and the U.S.
[01:00:15.819 --> 01:00:16.020]  news.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.781]  All... I'm sure you've all seen it, folks.
[01:00:18.821 --> 01:00:19.642]  It's all over Infowars.
[01:00:19.662 --> 01:00:31.569]  But just yesterday, today, I watched dozens of clips of them just viciously, like attack dogs, from Geraldo Rivera on Fox to you name it, just saying, these people are the scum of the earth.
[01:00:32.594 --> 01:00:38.858]  Kyle Kemper is a talk show host and a writer and advisor and entrepreneur and father, and he is a critical thinker.
[01:00:38.898 --> 01:00:44.262]  He's also the half-brother of the other mother of the current leader, who says he wishes he could have a dictatorship.
[01:00:44.542 --> 01:00:48.685]  So in this shorter segment, longer segment's coming up, Kyle, what is it like on the ground?
[01:00:49.185 --> 01:00:50.446]  Where do you see this going?
[01:00:51.146 --> 01:00:54.389]  Now the police are quitting en masse, both federal and local, saying they won't be part of it.
[01:00:54.689 --> 01:00:58.411]  As you know, one of your judges said, stop stealing their gas.
[01:00:58.952 --> 01:01:01.713]  So it really seems beyond stalemate.
[01:01:03.095 --> 01:01:06.140]  The establishment up there has really met something they can't deal with.
[01:01:07.674 --> 01:01:12.738]  I mean, I think the entire global establishment, Alex, has met something that they can't deal with.
[01:01:12.798 --> 01:01:16.320]  And we're seeing them in scramble mode right now and in damage control.
[01:01:17.141 --> 01:01:20.043]  And, you know, people are waking up.
[01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:33.813]  And this is not like, you know, a G20 protest that's full of provocateurs and it has just a violent agitation or a BLM kind of protest that, you know, had violence, you know, and hate at its core.
[01:01:34.273 --> 01:01:39.003]  This is a love driven, you know, I wouldn't even call it a protest.
[01:01:39.264 --> 01:01:40.306]  It's an experience.
[01:01:40.446 --> 01:01:41.548]  It's a gathering.
[01:01:42.378 --> 01:01:43.259]  It's a gathering.
[01:01:43.519 --> 01:01:45.401]  It's unbelievable.
[01:01:45.741 --> 01:01:47.903]  And, you know, they're not reporting some things.
[01:01:48.184 --> 01:01:53.108]  Crime in Ottawa is way, way, way down.
[01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:56.191]  The streets are cleaner than they've ever been.
[01:01:56.952 --> 01:02:02.437]  And, you know, you're even seeing from the police chiefs say this is an increasingly dangerous and escalating situation.
[01:02:02.918 --> 01:02:05.640]  Like, no, that is just pure, that is false.
[01:02:07.461 --> 01:02:21.044]  It is peaceful to the core, and the organizers have made repeated requests to sit down with the city to discuss how this can be more, even better and safer.
[01:02:21.064 --> 01:02:22.204]  That's right, that's key.
[01:02:22.224 --> 01:02:24.324]  They're not terrorists who blew something up and demanded something.
[01:02:24.604 --> 01:02:34.186]  They showed up peacefully to the terrorists and said, we want parlay, we want to speak to you before the trucks got there, and they've never even talked to them and respected them like they're human.
[01:02:35.535 --> 01:02:36.856]  And they didn't just show up.
[01:02:36.996 --> 01:02:45.323]  They drove all across Canada in an enormous convoy with every single overpass packed with people.
[01:02:45.783 --> 01:02:52.728]  It presented an opportunity for people to come together and realize that they are not alone.
[01:02:52.748 --> 01:03:02.023]   And a number of people of my friends who have said to me that I'm not afraid anymore, because I see all the people.
[01:03:03.404 --> 01:03:05.525]  We are awakened to this.
[01:03:06.006 --> 01:03:17.424]   The energy is of a higher vibration, and I feel like this is a great threat to this Agenda that you talk about at length.
[01:03:17.904 --> 01:03:25.576]  Oh, we know internal documents just to add to what you're saying came out that they want to make people depressed and get us into an act of being broken so they can program us.
[01:03:25.616 --> 01:03:29.402]  They literally don't want us at a high spiritual connected level.
[01:03:30.911 --> 01:03:53.540]   Right, and when you get people together and when there's energy and there's communal effort and things are decommodified like what's taking place in Ottawa right now is there is so much gifting and sharing and communal activity all with a civic responsibility There's a sense of immediacy towards getting things done, and they're aiming to leave no trace as well.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:04:04.325]  And all those that I just mentioned are all part of the principles of Burning Man, which has been an incredible, abundant festival that over the years has been morphing and growing.
[01:04:04.645 --> 01:04:12.228]  And now we're seeing those higher vibrations spreading out, and it's influenced this gathering.
[01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:16.252]  No, the speeches are incredible.
[01:04:16.272 --> 01:04:21.418]  Well, I totally agree because the global lockdowns, remember what one of your Canadian health ministers said, we can't let them organize.
[01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:23.380]  They might disagree with us and talk to each other.
[01:04:23.661 --> 01:04:24.442]  That's a quote.
[01:04:24.682 --> 01:04:26.264]  They are so scared of us coming together.
[01:04:26.284 --> 01:04:27.846]  That's why they want churches closed.
[01:04:27.966 --> 01:04:31.230]  Why are they so scared of us coming together and being physically around each other?
[01:04:32.188 --> 01:04:34.710]  Indeed, and same with the restaurants.
[01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.031]  Closing down the restaurants.
[01:04:36.432 --> 01:04:39.934]  I was in Whistler last year and they would not even let me talk to another table.
[01:04:39.954 --> 01:04:43.377]  It was absolutely crazy.
[01:04:43.417 --> 01:04:45.639]  That's why I had to leave Canada.
[01:04:45.659 --> 01:04:47.080]  I'm not in Canada right now.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:50.143]  I wish, for the first time in a long time, I wish I was in Ottawa.
[01:04:50.903 --> 01:04:55.287]  But I'm doing my part from afar towards aiding.
[01:04:55.387 --> 01:04:56.488]  Brother, I don't blame you, man.
[01:04:56.528 --> 01:04:57.789]  It's been scary as hell up there.
[01:04:59.369 --> 01:05:03.932]  And it's, and it's, and it's just, it's been bizarre and, you know, so disconnected.
[01:05:04.032 --> 01:05:08.814]  And, but at the same time, they also, like, you know, they never stopped the alcohol from flowing.
[01:05:08.855 --> 01:05:12.877]  They just meant, they just stopped it from, you know, people gathering to drink alcohol.
[01:05:12.977 --> 01:05:15.939]  So it was like, keep going to the stores and buy it and consume it at home.
[01:05:16.359 --> 01:05:18.540]  We also legalized marijuana too.
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:22.923]  So, you know, all of a sudden everybody can get baked out of their minds with this.
[01:05:23.063 --> 01:05:26.765]  And, you know, Netflix has never been stronger in the programming within it.
[01:05:27.486 --> 01:05:32.716]  All of this was done because they are afraid of the Great Awakening.
[01:05:32.756 --> 01:05:33.557]  It's even in the WikiLeaks.
[01:05:33.838 --> 01:05:35.781]  They're afraid of this Awakening.
[01:05:35.801 --> 01:05:36.803]  They call it an Awakening.
[01:05:36.823 --> 01:05:37.525]  They're so scared.
[01:05:38.999 --> 01:05:41.782]  And this is the critical thing, and nothing will stop it.
[01:05:41.902 --> 01:05:44.344]  We are in this age transition.
[01:05:44.905 --> 01:05:46.826]  It's a done deal.
[01:05:47.487 --> 01:05:54.854]  And The Great Reset, I feel like, is their answer and their desired ideal outcome.
[01:05:55.154 --> 01:05:59.899]  And what I want to talk to you about maybe in our next segment is let's talk about ideal outcomes.
[01:06:00.339 --> 01:06:04.562]  Let's discuss, you know, what can we do as a collective?
[01:06:04.582 --> 01:06:05.143]  I totally agree.
[01:06:05.223 --> 01:06:10.486]  What should these masses of people around the world be saying their goals are other than, we don't want to be locked up and be slaves?
[01:06:10.646 --> 01:06:14.870]  Start talking about what an ideal outcome and a communal outcome could be.
[01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:23.716]  You know, not asking for, not seeking to ask these guys to continue to hold on to power to, you know, to release... But to just say, what are we going to do?
[01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:26.068]  What are we going to do?
[01:06:26.408 --> 01:06:30.512]  Is our system of governance still appropriate?
[01:06:30.832 --> 01:06:33.274]  It was invented in a time when there wasn't electricity.
[01:06:33.754 --> 01:06:41.140]  When, you know, you actually had to have representatives from geographical regions to, you know, make decisions at a federal level.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:48.065]  But, you know, now we can send a message from, you know, the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean in a millisecond.
[01:06:49.226 --> 01:06:52.689]  So, the fundamentals have changed.
[01:06:53.269 --> 01:07:04.773]  And I think it's time that we start having real discussions of inclusive, like, you know, open debate about what we want to see, what the ideal outcomes look like.
[01:07:05.193 --> 01:07:07.514]  How can we start building towards that?
[01:07:07.794 --> 01:07:16.557]  How can we turn this pyramid upside down so that it's not the few controlling the many, but the many witnessing and holding accountable the few?
[01:07:16.958 --> 01:07:17.378]  That's right.
[01:07:18.718 --> 01:07:19.579]  And I know that's coming.
[01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:20.159]  We'll be right back.
[01:07:19.979 --> 01:07:26.979]  Stay with us.
[01:07:26.979 --> 01:07:35.979]   Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:07:36.814 --> 01:07:42.056]  You know, it's not just in Exodus, in the Old Testament, 3,000 plus years old.
[01:07:43.817 --> 01:07:48.779]  It's not just in the Charlton Heston movie, The Ten Commandments.
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:55.242]  It's carved on the Egyptian walls of their temples about Ramses.
[01:07:57.148 --> 01:08:02.631]  Well, Ramesses II, if memory serves, and the Jews leaving and being expelled and all the things that happened.
[01:08:04.613 --> 01:08:06.254]  And that was a big turning in that time.
[01:08:06.854 --> 01:08:12.738]  And why had Ramesses' father ordered all the firstborn Israelite boys killed?
[01:08:13.158 --> 01:08:20.438]   That was done all over the Middle East, all over Asia, all over Europe, all over Mesoamerica.
[01:08:20.438 --> 01:08:24.997]   And you think, well, the ancient people in what's Mexico today, 3,000 years ago,
[01:08:24.997 --> 01:08:29.238]   were they talking to, you know, were the Mayans, that was before the Aztecs,
[01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:35.318]   those same people, different culture, were the Toltecs, the Olmecs, were they talking to
[01:08:36.677 --> 01:08:41.718]  Ramses I, sacrificing Jewish boys? No.
[01:08:41.908 --> 01:08:44.170]  No, but there was something making them do it.
[01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:47.993]  But see, no one I know has a compulsion to want to have sex with children.
[01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:53.109]  No one I know has, or they never told me, I know I don't, a compulsion to kill firstborn children.
[01:08:53.309 --> 01:08:54.951]  I want to take care of children, love children.
[01:08:54.971 --> 01:08:57.073]  They just make you feel high when you're around them.
[01:08:57.433 --> 01:09:00.516]  But there's something in humans, twisted, that does that.
[01:09:00.596 --> 01:09:09.726]  And when you read the public statements by Ted Turner and Bill Gates and all of them, they say there's too many people, Klaus Schwab, we've got to get rid of them.
[01:09:11.934 --> 01:09:15.017]  Well, were there too many people in the time of Plato, 2300 years ago?
[01:09:15.117 --> 01:09:16.338]  He thought there were too many Greeks.
[01:09:16.378 --> 01:09:18.059]  He thought most of them should be killed.
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:33.312]  So there's this instinct to depopulate in ruling classes, and now they see the big populations and the issues and the problems, and their instinct is, kill a bunch of us, and shut us down and make us prisoners, and that'll fix all the problems.
[01:09:34.206 --> 01:09:36.987]  Well, I think that's a problem in the ruling class, not a problem in us.
[01:09:37.887 --> 01:09:44.650]  So you're talking about positive things, Karl Kemper, and I want to get some of the negative things and anything you can add about your brother and what makes him tick.
[01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:45.410]  People want to hear that.
[01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:50.872]  I mean, who else endorses Chinese-style dictatorship and says, I want to be a dictator?
[01:09:51.332 --> 01:09:53.213]  And who else says, you're not allowed to criticize me?
[01:09:53.273 --> 01:09:55.054]  And yeah, you got basic rights to the charter.
[01:09:55.074 --> 01:09:56.094]  We're going to take those away.
[01:09:56.114 --> 01:09:58.395]  I mean, it's like a cartoon character.
[01:09:58.815 --> 01:10:00.856]  If I was trying to destroy myself, I would act like him.
[01:10:02.219 --> 01:10:12.526]  To understand the fourth turning, which I agree with the scientists and historians, that's not mumbo-jumbo, it's historic, political, cultural, fourth turning, but it's also aligned with a lot of other things that are going on.
[01:10:12.546 --> 01:10:21.653]  We know there are cycles and we're going out of a very crazy cycle into another cycle, that generally cycles are very positive at the beginning and then go into the cataclysm point.
[01:10:22.073 --> 01:10:31.660]  As you said, the globalists want to create a global crisis, artificially control the collapse, because they know there are cycles they can't control, so maybe if they trigger it first, they think they can ride the dragon.
[01:10:32.368 --> 01:10:38.693]  So get into where you think that's going and I want to talk about some of the problems that we face and how that ties into the depopulation.
[01:10:38.733 --> 01:10:40.835]  We see they're attempting again.
[01:10:44.278 --> 01:10:54.358]   Right. You know, I would I would I would say, like, you know, specifically to to Justin,
[01:10:54.358 --> 01:10:55.797]  I'll just talk to him for a second.
[01:10:55.907 --> 01:11:03.094]   It's like he like Uh, approval and he likes to be, you know, uh, loved and liked.
[01:11:03.134 --> 01:11:07.058]  I think like many people do, um, like it's natural for the ego to want that.
[01:11:07.558 --> 01:11:26.933]   So, I mean, at this moment, I can only imagine and I feel like, you know, his heart, uh, Being greatly hurt by what's taking place because an enormous amount of Canadians are incredibly frustrated and have lost faith and have become disconnected from him.
[01:11:27.553 --> 01:11:35.419]  And now it seems like, you know, only people he can kind of turn to for approval are, you know, the people behind the curtains.
[01:11:39.143 --> 01:11:42.866]  You know, you kind of got a little bit biblical about that.
[01:11:43.546 --> 01:11:50.531]  Someone told me about the story of Matthew and how he went to the top of the mountain and was offered everything as long as he gave in.
[01:11:50.551 --> 01:12:04.101]  You know, I think a lot of people have taken that option where Jesus did not take, you know, that and he pursued like, you know, because he presented the option that the kingdom of heaven can be realized here on earth.
[01:12:05.061 --> 01:12:14.046]  And I think it's really important that we stay in the light and that the whole COVID, whatever this thing has been, it's been chaos.
[01:12:14.707 --> 01:12:27.094]  And one of the things, if you look at the field of cymatics, if you put sand on a vibration board and you change the vibration, it goes from one sacred pattern to another.
[01:12:27.414 --> 01:12:30.676]  But between the shifts of patterns, there is chaos.
[01:12:32.072 --> 01:12:42.276]  And whether this was evil and dark, or whether this was somehow divine as well, there's been great darkness, but there's also great light, and this is one of these kind of events.
[01:12:42.296 --> 01:12:43.536]  No, I totally agree, and I want to pull that up.
[01:12:43.616 --> 01:12:55.280]  What is that call they discovered, and it matches all the Indian and Hindu symbols on their temples, that now they know different sounds create different incredible sacred geometry, the lotus stars, all of it.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.902]  And literally, you can just, what's that called?
[01:12:57.942 --> 01:12:59.103]  You send it through a metal pan?
[01:12:59.123 --> 01:13:01.644]  Psyematics.
[01:13:01.664 --> 01:13:03.306]  Guys, pull up on YouTube, Psyematics.
[01:13:03.826 --> 01:13:04.366]  It's incredible.
[01:13:04.507 --> 01:13:10.171]  And by the way, there was a scientist, I forget, a mathematician, a French mathematician, it was over 100 years ago, I forget his name.
[01:13:10.191 --> 01:13:11.932]  I'm not good at pronouncing French.
[01:13:12.332 --> 01:13:26.098]   But he predicted that if we ever flew a probe over Saturn, That it would have cymatics because of its giant size that would manifest an interdimensional force showing a hexagon on the top, and when they flew Voyager over it, there it was, brother.
[01:13:26.118 --> 01:13:27.701]  I mean, that is incredible.
[01:13:29.494 --> 01:13:29.714]  Right.
[01:13:29.974 --> 01:13:38.838]  And it's like, as you'll notice, between these shifts, and I think as the vibration gets going even higher there, it's a little bit more, a little bit more chaotic, but then it settles.
[01:13:39.098 --> 01:13:39.238]  Yeah.
[01:13:39.298 --> 01:13:40.078]  In between, right?
[01:13:41.019 --> 01:13:43.580]  Into these, into these, you know, these beautiful patterns.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:46.641]  And there is so much beauty in nature.
[01:13:46.661 --> 01:13:50.342]  And one of the things is we are living in this age of abundance.
[01:13:50.762 --> 01:14:03.231]   And one of the tools that these, you know, the few are trying to use against the many is is control suppression and this illusion of scarcity. You
[01:14:03.231 --> 01:14:04.831]  must fight against the other.
[01:14:04.831 --> 01:14:08.672]  For me to have one thing means somebody else can't have it.
[01:14:08.672 --> 01:14:09.952]  It's like a game of Monopoly.
[01:14:09.952 --> 01:14:16.032]   It's a terrible game. But if you like the game of Catan, perhaps. Catan's a fantastic game. But
[01:14:16.032 --> 01:14:21.552]   imagine if you played Catan with everybody and you all tried to develop the world to the best
[01:14:21.552 --> 01:14:22.752]  of your abilities.
[01:14:22.992 --> 01:14:31.520]  That is the opportunity that we have now through radical collaboration of awakened, innovative, creative people.
[01:14:32.281 --> 01:14:36.586]  Everybody has their role in one shape or another to participate in this.
[01:14:37.086 --> 01:14:49.453]  Instead of, like, you know, criticizing, being negative about the situation, it's important to understand the reality of the situation and to criticize it by creating.
[01:14:50.033 --> 01:14:50.734]  I totally agree.
[01:14:50.754 --> 01:14:53.795]  The best way is not to even fight something, it's to build something new.
[01:14:53.815 --> 01:14:57.177]  That's why Christ said, get behind me, Satan, because Christ isn't even fighting Satan.
[01:14:57.538 --> 01:14:59.419]  Christ is moving forward, creating the new universe.
[01:15:00.419 --> 01:15:01.840]  What would you say more to your brother?
[01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:04.501]  So you're saying he's not inherently evil, he's just a follower?
[01:15:04.521 --> 01:15:06.421]  I mean, he literally worships Klaus Schwab.
[01:15:06.441 --> 01:15:15.865]  He does seem very childlike, like he believes this, and it comes across like he really believes it, whereas with the other globalists, they're like laughing and giggling and, no, it's a joke.
[01:15:16.165 --> 01:15:18.946]  Is your brother literally, like, mind-controlled or in a trance?
[01:15:21.715 --> 01:15:25.938]  I mean, I can't say for certain, but I think those are very good hypotheses.
[01:15:25.958 --> 01:15:31.062]  I think, you know, he is not free.
[01:15:31.082 --> 01:15:33.504]  He is not living a freedom life.
[01:15:33.564 --> 01:15:39.929]  You know, I've had a chance to witness over the last decade the reality of his situation.
[01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:44.973]  And, you know, he has security details around him all the time.
[01:15:45.512 --> 01:15:50.512]  which protects him, but it also traps him.
[01:15:50.512 --> 01:15:53.512]  Imagine being in an open-air prison all the time.
[01:15:53.512 --> 01:15:57.512]  I don't believe he's not able to come on the show.
[01:15:57.512 --> 01:16:02.512]  He doesn't engage in open discussion or debate about topics.
[01:16:02.512 --> 01:16:09.512]   And I think this is really critical because when you're promoting an agenda
[01:16:09.512 --> 01:16:15.512]   that is inherently deceptive and is based on lies, you can't debate them.
[01:16:16.029 --> 01:16:20.732]  And we've seen this with the whole climate change fiasco.
[01:16:20.772 --> 01:16:24.375]  And trust me, I believe in the environment and being a good steward of the environment.
[01:16:25.365 --> 01:16:28.286]  Their agenda is totally different than taking care of the environment.
[01:16:29.287 --> 01:16:31.227]  And the truth is open to debate.
[01:16:31.307 --> 01:16:32.748]  It stands up to debate.
[01:16:32.868 --> 01:16:33.788]  Let's debate it.
[01:16:33.849 --> 01:16:42.032]  Let's have open discussions about the censorship, the misinformation, the doublespeak at all levels.
[01:16:42.792 --> 01:16:43.513]  Well, that's right.
[01:16:43.593 --> 01:16:46.054]  Something that's good can survive being challenged.
[01:16:46.194 --> 01:16:48.415]  Only something evil can't be challenged.
[01:16:48.455 --> 01:16:54.099]  Let's come back then with Carl Kemper, brother of the Prime Minister of Canada.
[01:16:54.119 --> 01:16:57.561]  Give us his take on the lockdowns, where he thinks Canada's going.
[01:16:57.961 --> 01:17:01.423]  I think the globals are kind of turning off some of their control right now just to make us go back to sleep.
[01:17:01.443 --> 01:17:02.223]  They're going to bring it back.
[01:17:02.624 --> 01:17:04.064]  I want to get his take on that straight ahead.
[01:17:04.545 --> 01:17:06.626]  Loveandfreedomshow.com is his website.
[01:17:07.409 --> 01:17:17.613]  Look, I understand I've been on there 28 years, and I've read a lot of globalist documents, a lot of their statements, and I've seen a lot of their propaganda and brainwashing through science fiction where they're pre-programming us.
[01:17:18.253 --> 01:17:19.853]  I'm not saying all science fiction is bad, it's great.
[01:17:20.154 --> 01:17:23.915]  I've just, I've learned that that's like their religious texts, basically, with some of the key writers.
[01:17:25.255 --> 01:17:27.796]  And that's what they're projecting and planning for humanity.
[01:17:27.816 --> 01:17:29.757]  So I know the different agendas they've got.
[01:17:31.926 --> 01:17:34.989]  And so yes, there's a human awakening and humanity is going to the next level.
[01:17:35.269 --> 01:17:38.091]  Not everybody is going to do that or be part of that.
[01:17:38.112 --> 01:17:39.032]  That's just the way it is.
[01:17:39.132 --> 01:17:42.355]  But the globalists plan massive global power outages.
[01:17:42.375 --> 01:17:43.556]  They blame on cyber attacks.
[01:17:44.017 --> 01:17:45.058]  They plan wars.
[01:17:45.278 --> 01:17:47.119]  They plan viral releases.
[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:50.682]  They brag how they're going to do this in Operation Lockstep and others.
[01:17:51.423 --> 01:18:02.769]  British Ministry of Defence document 2007, I forget the exact name of it, but it's flash mobs, brain chips, a grim vision of the future, and Government Ministry of Defence report.
[01:18:03.730 --> 01:18:05.631]  You can pull that up, just type in what I said and it'll come up.
[01:18:07.012 --> 01:18:10.914]  Flash mobs, brain chips, a Ministry of Defence grim vision of the future.
[01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:15.653]  And then I learned that I'd read stuff when they wrote in the 60s and it happened by the 80s.
[01:18:16.134 --> 01:18:17.796]  And stuff they said in the 80s happened by the 2000s.
[01:18:18.036 --> 01:18:21.519]  So I've learned that they're not just doing all this playing games.
[01:18:22.961 --> 01:18:26.164]  And it's to try to take control of the human cycle and play God.
[01:18:26.364 --> 01:18:27.445]  It's a control freak thing.
[01:18:28.382 --> 01:18:32.702]   from that position but instead they're trying to alter the normal course of humanity
[01:18:32.702 --> 01:18:37.502]   and they're causing more disturbance and more danger in my view and I think that's what Kyle
[01:18:37.502 --> 01:18:44.941]   Kemper who is the half brother of the current leader of Canada, Justin Trudeau. Other points
[01:18:44.941 --> 01:18:51.741]   you'd like to make and I've got a few other questions. Well I mean you just mentioned
[01:18:51.741 --> 01:18:55.261]   something about the you know the science fiction writing so like
[01:18:55.454 --> 01:19:01.141]  Brave New World was a book that I read in school very, very long ago and I've since re-read it.
[01:19:00.761 --> 01:19:10.421]   I read it and it's really, a lot of these people, they saw what was coming and they've projected it.
[01:19:10.421 --> 01:19:19.201]   And one of the things that they did in Brave New World was that when people were getting agitated
[01:19:19.201 --> 01:19:24.061]  or starting to ask questions, they dosed them with Soma.
[01:19:24.061 --> 01:19:26.640]  So they just spray Soma in the air.
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:32.661]   And two days ago, here in California, I looked at the, well right now.
[01:19:32.374 --> 01:19:36.897]  I look out, look at the window, look at the sky, and it is a beautiful, clear, perfect sky.
[01:19:37.357 --> 01:19:43.921]  Two days ago, the sky all the way south to San Diego, all the way north to L.A.
[01:19:44.281 --> 01:19:50.925]  had hundreds of streamers that created a gigantic blanket, which just settled down.
[01:19:51.185 --> 01:19:52.146]  What do you think about that, Alex?
[01:19:53.581 --> 01:19:56.523]  Well, they've declassified that they're manipulating the weather with that.
[01:19:56.583 --> 01:20:00.086]  It's a huge declassified program that is still classified in the details.
[01:20:01.166 --> 01:20:03.848]  Geoengineering, Bill Gates runs it with the Department of Energy.
[01:20:03.868 --> 01:20:07.651]  But there's also, I told people 10 years ago, weaponized marijuana.
[01:20:07.671 --> 01:20:12.154]  I'm not against people smoking marijuana, but the stuff now is 10, 20, 30 times stronger.
[01:20:12.174 --> 01:20:12.915]  It's psychotropic.
[01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:16.497]  And that's why George Soros and the system is pushing it.
[01:20:16.517 --> 01:20:18.639]  Because you smoke that, you're on another planet.
[01:20:19.119 --> 01:20:27.965]  Same thing with all the liquor stores are all open, but the churches are closed, the parks are closed, the gyms are closed, the libraries are closed.
[01:20:27.985 --> 01:20:30.086]  Anything good for you is closed.
[01:20:30.146 --> 01:20:35.850]  Anything bad, and I'm not saying a beer or something with friends, it's meant ritualistically at small doses.
[01:20:36.271 --> 01:20:39.293]  But buy yourself and your house drinking Jack Daniels, get ready to die.
[01:20:39.693 --> 01:20:48.719]  And everything they do, like handing out $300 million or $30 million in crack pipes to black people, it's all a sick joke by these globalists.
[01:20:50.059 --> 01:20:51.440]  I mean, I can't even believe that.
[01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:54.141]  Like, that is just so absurd.
[01:20:54.661 --> 01:20:57.522]  And, like, the tolerance of people to accept these things.
[01:20:57.942 --> 01:20:59.883]  Same with the rituals that are taking place.
[01:21:00.103 --> 01:21:02.184]  Like, you know, the children wearing the masks.
[01:21:02.744 --> 01:21:04.405]  People wearing... Oh, those are all... Explain rituals.
[01:21:04.445 --> 01:21:05.025]  You're a smart guy.
[01:21:05.045 --> 01:21:06.806]  These are all rituals of enslavement.
[01:21:06.906 --> 01:21:07.906]  Rituals that were dirty.
[01:21:07.926 --> 01:21:09.967]  Rituals that we are the criminals.
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:13.481]  Yeah, and it's also like just showing compliance.
[01:21:13.501 --> 01:21:27.085]  Like, if you can get, if you can do something that you know in your heart doesn't make any sense, because, like, you know, you're afraid of what might take place, you're basically giving them your power.
[01:21:27.246 --> 01:21:28.146]  It's a tyranny test.
[01:21:28.186 --> 01:21:29.146]  So let me ask you this.
[01:21:30.046 --> 01:21:32.867]  Let's talk more about your brother, because I didn't just get you on to dig dirt on your brother.
[01:21:32.887 --> 01:21:37.149]  And I understand you're trying to lovingly, you know, wake him up.
[01:21:37.887 --> 01:21:42.891]  But he is one of the only world leaders that you see him saying this stuff, he looks like he believes it.
[01:21:43.271 --> 01:21:46.033]  The others, it's completely obvious that they're not buying into this.
[01:21:46.573 --> 01:21:52.658]  So knowing him and what's going on, you really think he is just doing this for approval and is in a police state cocoon?
[01:21:55.838 --> 01:22:52.724]   I think he accepted that deal on the top of the mountain and now he is under control by others and I think he's in a really unique position right now and my advice to him and I think the advice of all the truckers and freedom loving people of the world is step down, resign, get out, die a symbolic political death and trigger the great awakening of humanity and show that freedom is powerful and that civic responsibility and using our collective voices to stand up to oppression and tyranny is a actionable, viable solution, especially when it's done, you know, using love and high vibrations and music and connection and collective communal effort.
[01:22:53.565 --> 01:22:55.166]  Like, that's what needs to happen.
[01:22:55.686 --> 01:22:57.668]  I don't think your brother is pure evil at the end of the day.
[01:22:57.488 --> 01:23:01.488]   I want to repeat this and expand on it because I don't know what headline I'd give this interview today.
[01:23:01.488 --> 01:23:06.337]   We're live right now. Millions of folks are tuning in, but I wanted to archive it so hundreds of thousands or millions
[01:23:06.337 --> 01:23:07.488]  may end up watching it later.
[01:23:07.488 --> 01:23:11.488]   But what you just said is incredible. I don't think your brother is pure evil at the end of the day.
[01:23:11.488 --> 01:23:16.488]   That's how he's tricked and still comes off as more credible even though he's telling lies.
[01:23:16.488 --> 01:23:19.488]  I'm like how does all these other leaders look totally fake?
[01:23:19.331 --> 01:23:23.154]  Boris Johnson, Macron, Merkel, Biden.
[01:23:23.654 --> 01:23:26.356]  But with him, he looks like he actually believes it, but I know it's a lie.
[01:23:26.737 --> 01:23:28.578]  How could he convince his eyes to look like that?
[01:23:28.898 --> 01:23:30.720]  Well, he just basically is captured by this.
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:33.182]  He may still have some good in him, like Darth Vader.
[01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:38.466]  And if he came out and said, I was lied to, I was wrong, I'm resigning.
[01:23:38.546 --> 01:23:39.967]  Not to hold on to power to say he was wrong.
[01:23:40.367 --> 01:23:41.068]  I'm resigning.
[01:23:41.088 --> 01:23:43.270]  We should bring down the Great Reset and Klaus Schwab.
[01:23:43.670 --> 01:23:44.931]  We should unify humanity.
[01:23:45.859 --> 01:23:49.584]  He, if he wants to be loved, he would then be loved and help bring us out of this.
[01:23:49.784 --> 01:23:52.784]  I mean, I would love to see him do that.
[01:23:52.784 --> 01:23:56.944]  Look at that photo, global citizen, like this guy.
[01:23:56.944 --> 01:24:11.503]   He had a wonderful run of all sorts of amazing experiences in his eyes, but at the sacrifice of so many,
[01:24:11.503 --> 01:24:22.684]   and the spending and the effects that will have if we continue in this existing framework,
[01:24:22.684 --> 01:24:24.944]  we'll damage all Canadians.
[01:24:25.368 --> 01:24:32.342]   But for him, it's again, this concept of just surrender, just release.
[01:24:32.342 --> 01:24:36.943]   Doesn't mean you have to go and wave a white flag and put yourself in handcuffs and go over.
[01:24:36.943 --> 01:24:39.183]  Just surrender to the will of the people.
[01:24:39.183 --> 01:24:42.943]  Be clear, you've lost the mandate of the people.
[01:24:42.943 --> 01:24:44.382]  People don't believe you.
[01:24:44.382 --> 01:24:50.422]   You cannot, there's no way he could get Canadians to come out to a rally right now.
[01:24:50.422 --> 01:24:57.222]   Like he might be able to get a whole fill of room with blue check marks from Twitter,
[01:24:57.222 --> 01:25:01.563]   who are paid to be there and paid to repeat his talking points and--
[01:25:01.563 --> 01:25:06.203]   But I was about to say, he's such a pool of water like a mirror.
[01:25:06.676 --> 01:25:10.344]  He looks totally freaked out now, like the other globals don't know how to act like they're winning.
[01:25:11.266 --> 01:25:13.250]  I think he knows now he's been destroyed.
[01:25:13.290 --> 01:25:15.294]  I mean, you know your brother better than other people.
[01:25:15.615 --> 01:25:16.597]  I mean, aren't you picking up now?
[01:25:16.918 --> 01:25:17.819]  He looks pretty deflated.
[01:25:19.969 --> 01:25:24.851]  Yeah, I mean, that photo, like that one was, that whole interview is kind of weird for a number of reasons.
[01:25:25.951 --> 01:25:34.834]  But yeah, he's definitely like, you know, it's wearing on him and like, you know, he doesn't have the support of the people.
[01:25:34.954 --> 01:25:45.998]  So again, just surrender to this, like, you know, reconnect with source, reconnect with soul, like, you know, start going through the process of healing.
[01:25:47.576 --> 01:25:49.137]  You know, it's like in the Catholic Church.
[01:25:49.837 --> 01:25:54.859]  Confess and repent and take your penance towards this.
[01:25:54.879 --> 01:25:55.680]  That's right.
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:58.041]  By admitting you're wrong, that's really the beginning of healing.
[01:25:58.481 --> 01:25:59.601]  Have you talked to your brother lately?
[01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:01.222]  I have not.
[01:26:01.782 --> 01:26:01.942]  No.
[01:26:02.282 --> 01:26:04.123]  We had a breakdown.
[01:26:04.803 --> 01:26:10.005]  Last time I talked to him, I think it was on my wedding day, when I had invited them to come and be part of it.
[01:26:11.086 --> 01:26:14.707]  I had a very large wedding planned and everything was rolling.
[01:26:16.976 --> 01:26:25.020]  Um, all this stuff happened and, uh, you know, our venue was owned by the, by, by the Shopify folks.
[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:32.743]  And they were also, Shopify is also very complicit in, um, in promoting the agenda in Canada and stoking the fear.
[01:26:33.483 --> 01:26:37.345]  Um, which, which really frustrated me because... So how long ago was that?
[01:26:37.365 --> 01:26:38.705]  Did your wedding get shut down by the COVID?
[01:26:39.506 --> 01:26:39.766]  That was 8-8-2020.
[01:26:39.806 --> 01:26:40.066]  So, yeah.
[01:26:43.203 --> 01:26:46.647]  So anyways, we had a beautiful sacred ceremony of like, you know, a small gathering.
[01:26:46.707 --> 01:26:48.028]  It was absolutely lovely.
[01:26:48.128 --> 01:26:52.893]  But, you know, once all this passes, we'll have a big celebration and many people can come together.
[01:26:52.913 --> 01:26:56.056]  In my view, statistically smaller weddings, marriages last longer.
[01:26:56.457 --> 01:26:59.900]  I'm not putting anybody down that has big weddings, but, you know, to me, it's about a man and a woman together.
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:02.223]  And, you know, that's what it's really all about, where they're at.
[01:27:02.703 --> 01:27:04.184]  All right, brother, do five more minutes with us.
[01:27:04.224 --> 01:27:11.306]  Kyle Kemper is a really interesting fella, and I want to just get his prediction when we come back on what he thinks ends up happening in Canada and now the rest of the world.
[01:27:11.647 --> 01:27:17.989]  And then we're going to open up the phones in the third hour today, Thursday, February 10th, 2022.
[01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:21.791]  Please don't forget, we're funded by you.

[01:27:29.313 --> 01:27:37.957]   Kyle Kemper is A father, entrepreneur, writer, mentor, problem solver, activator, critical thinker.
[01:27:38.057 --> 01:27:39.938]  Website's loveandfreedomshow.com.
[01:27:40.518 --> 01:27:41.539]  On Twitter at Kyle Kemper.
[01:27:41.979 --> 01:27:49.183]  And he's the brother of the current Prime Minister who's trying to establish a biomedical tyranny and hailing that Klaus Schwab is his master.
[01:27:50.024 --> 01:27:55.027]  In the five minutes we have left, what else would you like to get across to this audience?
[01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:58.901]  Well, to the whole audience, thank you, Alex.
[01:27:59.001 --> 01:28:11.086]  To the whole audience, I would like to just thank you and say that I have been with the Truth and Freedom movement for a very long time.
[01:28:12.779 --> 01:28:18.479]   I know it can become a little bit like, we recognize there's a lot of danger out there,
[01:28:18.479 --> 01:28:26.859]   but it's critically important at this time right now that we move forward and that we embrace love and freedom
[01:28:26.859 --> 01:28:36.679]   and we try and heal, because the future is about unity as a collective, and sure, we recognize there is a class
[01:28:36.679 --> 01:28:42.859]   of people that have done a lot of damage, but we need to heal, we need to heal our families,
[01:28:42.859 --> 01:28:49.818]   we need to heal our relationships with our friends, we need to start thinking about abundance and collective
[01:28:49.818 --> 01:28:54.479]  and radical collaboration towards building new systems.
[01:28:54.479 --> 01:28:56.638]   And by the way, just to interrupt you, I feel that drive.
[01:28:56.747 --> 01:28:59.989]  I've always felt that drive since I was a child, but it went away.
[01:29:00.109 --> 01:29:08.133]  Not completely away, but now the last year it's so strong to forgive people and build and be good and it's just driving me so hard.
[01:29:08.173 --> 01:29:12.576]  I'm trying to figure out how to comply with it, but it's like an urge way stronger than any other urge I ever had.
[01:29:14.258 --> 01:29:16.480]  And forgive yourself, too.
[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:17.900]  Self-compassion.
[01:29:18.181 --> 01:29:20.622]  Like, we've all done bad things in our lives.
[01:29:20.682 --> 01:29:22.023]  Like, we've all made mistakes.
[01:29:22.343 --> 01:29:25.365]  Don't, like, you know, apologize to yourself.
[01:29:25.866 --> 01:29:27.146]  Forgive yourself.
[01:29:27.627 --> 01:29:29.208]  Be thankful to yourself.
[01:29:29.948 --> 01:29:31.249]  And love yourself.
[01:29:31.569 --> 01:29:32.810]  Ho'oponopono.
[01:29:33.490 --> 01:29:35.872]  Sacred Hawaiian healing ritual.
[01:29:35.932 --> 01:29:39.314]  You can repeat that mantra to yourself, and you can repeat it to others.
[01:29:39.674 --> 01:29:43.297]  And it's fantastic in healing and creating love and connection.
[01:29:43.317 --> 01:29:43.657]  I agree with that.
[01:29:44.568 --> 01:29:45.648]  Ho'oponopono.
[01:29:46.489 --> 01:29:47.429]  I am sorry.
[01:29:49.029 --> 01:29:49.770]  Please forgive me.
[01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:52.110]  I'm thankful.
[01:29:54.091 --> 01:29:54.551]  I love you.
[01:29:55.671 --> 01:29:56.252]  That's beautiful.
[01:29:56.292 --> 01:29:56.732]  Say it again.
[01:29:56.752 --> 01:29:58.552]  Ho'oponopono.
[01:29:58.572 --> 01:29:59.513]  I love that.
[01:29:59.693 --> 01:30:00.253]  I'm sorry.
[01:30:00.273 --> 01:30:01.573]  Please forgive me.
[01:30:01.593 --> 01:30:10.936]  I say this, I'll say this to Justin, like, Justin, you know, I'm sorry for speaking out for, for, for causing any harm to you and the path that you were on.
[01:30:11.376 --> 01:30:12.136]  Please forgive me.
[01:30:12.177 --> 01:30:13.577]  I'm doing my absolute best.
[01:30:14.727 --> 01:30:23.050]  I'm so thankful to you for everything that you've taught me, for being an inspiration to so many people in the world, and I truly love you from the bottom of my heart.
[01:30:23.330 --> 01:30:24.630]  I love you with all my heart.
[01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:27.631]  I love you, and I'm doing this for you.
[01:30:27.751 --> 01:30:34.113]  I'm just doing this because I feel like I must do this, and nobody's forcing me to do any of this.
[01:30:34.294 --> 01:30:38.535]  I hold no oaths except to my wife, my incredible wife, Brittany.
[01:30:39.249 --> 01:30:40.810]  He's a divine angel in my life.
[01:30:42.431 --> 01:30:47.655]  And then the other thing that I would recommend to everybody is read The Four Agreements, especially as we move forward.
[01:30:47.955 --> 01:30:49.356]  Be impeccable with your words.
[01:30:49.817 --> 01:30:51.398]  Don't make too many assumptions.
[01:30:51.738 --> 01:30:53.259]  Don't take things personally.
[01:30:53.539 --> 01:30:55.141]  And always do your best.
[01:30:55.481 --> 01:30:56.341]  It's a short book.
[01:30:56.442 --> 01:30:57.662]  It's a powerful read.
[01:30:57.923 --> 01:30:59.163]  Ancient Toltec wisdom.
[01:31:00.645 --> 01:31:06.589]  And that will help you on realizing love and freedom and our greatest potential.
[01:31:08.021 --> 01:31:09.902]  Well, Alex, thank you so much, brother.
[01:31:10.002 --> 01:31:10.823]  I appreciate you.
[01:31:11.643 --> 01:31:13.424]  Like, I can't say enough.
[01:31:13.504 --> 01:31:23.950]  And as you're going into this next thing, recognize that you are a seed and that like, you know, you plant, you have this vision and you will manifest the vision.
[01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:33.795]  So if it's really important, I would say that we've really focused on creating, understanding the challenges that we have, but also like, you know, pushing towards positive action.
[01:31:33.835 --> 01:31:35.316]  And you do that so much.
[01:31:35.416 --> 01:31:38.857]   Just watching this whole cycle, the breaks, You know, bless you, brother.
[01:31:39.017 --> 01:31:39.877]  Thank you so much.
[01:31:39.897 --> 01:31:40.778]  Thank you, Kyle.
[01:31:40.878 --> 01:31:42.058]  And we really appreciate you.
[01:31:42.138 --> 01:31:44.099]  And I mean, I see success in Canada.
[01:31:44.119 --> 01:31:45.200]  I see this backfiring.
[01:31:46.061 --> 01:31:47.982]  I think the globalists have awakened Canada.
[01:31:48.002 --> 01:31:48.522]  What do you say?
[01:31:50.303 --> 01:31:51.383]  I believe so as well.
[01:31:51.584 --> 01:31:55.946]  And if you're in Canada, you know, rally together with your people, connect with your communities.
[01:31:55.986 --> 01:31:57.687]  If you're feeling disconnected, connect.
[01:31:57.997 --> 01:32:00.476]  We'll provide the invitation to connect with others.
[01:32:00.476 --> 01:32:04.197]  If you're in Ottawa, downtown, invite others to come join.
[01:32:04.197 --> 01:32:07.276]   Through love, through unity, through higher vibrations, we will--
[01:32:07.276 --> 01:32:09.596]   And through exposing what's happening that keeps them from attacking.
[01:32:09.596 --> 01:32:11.317]  Kyle Kemper, thank you so much.
[01:32:11.317 --> 01:32:22.396]  We'll be back with your phone calls straight ahead, InfoWars.com.
[01:32:22.396 --> 01:32:27.317]   With all the craziness going on in the world, with the globalists plotting their next big
[01:32:27.317 --> 01:32:31.997]   lockdown, with the next phase of the Great Reset being a staged cyber attack.
[01:32:32.371 --> 01:32:38.435]  With the deep state pushing a civil war, not just here, but in Europe, and war with Russia.
[01:32:38.875 --> 01:32:50.703]  With the massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place, like supply chain breakdowns, you need to get prepared now with high quality storable food that is ready to ship.
[01:32:51.143 --> 01:32:59.347]   And it's been four years since my Patriot Supply at preparewithalex.com has offered their storable food at 25% off.
[01:32:59.647 --> 01:33:00.867]  Four years!
[01:33:01.148 --> 01:33:05.529]  But right now, it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022.
[01:33:06.049 --> 01:33:15.371]  A little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at preparewithalex.com on the entire catalog of My Patriot Supply.
[01:33:15.831 --> 01:33:16.272]  Act now.
[01:33:16.572 --> 01:33:17.512]  Get prepared now.
[01:33:17.812 --> 01:33:21.213]  This is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[01:33:22.659 --> 01:33:29.147]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:33.432 --> 01:33:34.994]  I want listeners to understand something.
[01:33:35.034 --> 01:33:38.558]  The fact that I look old and exhausted is not a sign of weakness.
[01:33:38.619 --> 01:33:39.420]  It's a sign of strength.
[01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:49.891]   I am literally Forcing my will against the enemy and that is not physically good for anybody But that's what men are supposed to do and I don't mean that as a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.
[01:33:49.931 --> 01:34:04.097]   It's true I am putting my will against them constantly and my my strength and my honor and my courage is constant but That is something most people can't do, even a little bit.
[01:34:04.137 --> 01:34:06.439]  I do it constantly, and it's very destructive.
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:08.021]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:34:08.141 --> 01:34:11.063]  My spirit is eternal, and it's becoming stronger the whole time.
[01:34:11.103 --> 01:34:12.044]  The body becomes weaker.
[01:34:12.605 --> 01:34:17.089]  So pray for me that we can stay in attack formation against the globalists.
[01:34:17.449 --> 01:34:17.770]  Okay.
[01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:22.294]  Look, I got like 20 plus incredible clips I haven't gotten to right here.
[01:34:24.710 --> 01:34:28.854]  Biden just went and gave a speech in Culpeper, Virginia and said, I'm the devil, basically.
[01:34:29.635 --> 01:34:30.736]  We're going to play that in a moment.
[01:34:33.299 --> 01:34:34.520]  We've got so much here today.
[01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:39.905]  And then I'm going to give the phone number out at the end of this segment.
[01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:47.710]   But right now, let's play a short clip and I'll come back and comment on it.
[01:34:47.710 --> 01:35:00.349]   I think what annoys me most about white people is when they pretend like they're the victim.
[01:35:00.499 --> 01:35:02.760]  What's also annoying is when they, you know, when they kill us.
[01:35:04.141 --> 01:35:09.385]  What is fragile about whiteness when everything has been constructed around it?
[01:35:09.405 --> 01:35:12.767]  Every part of who I am has been distorted or criminalized.
[01:35:12.787 --> 01:35:15.149]  It's really just a bunch of white lies.
[01:35:15.169 --> 01:35:18.191]  We're storming the Capitol!
[01:35:19.432 --> 01:35:20.313]  You're not patriots.
[01:35:20.493 --> 01:35:21.594]  You're ridiculous.
[01:35:23.747 --> 01:35:28.771]  One of the definitions of American whiteness is ignorant.
[01:35:30.533 --> 01:35:33.335]  White people, we are not your problem.
[01:35:33.395 --> 01:35:34.076]  You are.
[01:35:34.236 --> 01:35:38.119]  Should white people today feel any responsibility for slavery?
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:39.841]  Hell yeah.
[01:35:40.721 --> 01:35:42.022]  White Jesus or black Jesus?
[01:35:42.263 --> 01:35:43.143]  Jesus was not white.
[01:35:43.464 --> 01:35:45.025]  Sick of geography.
[01:35:45.325 --> 01:35:48.288]  Ain't no way Jesus walked around with blonde hair and blue eyes.
[01:35:49.861 --> 01:35:51.463]  White culture fears the end of the world.
[01:35:51.803 --> 01:35:55.847]  For us, as Native people, the end of the world already happened, like, multiple times.
[01:35:59.190 --> 01:36:02.353]  Symbols and monuments, these are mementos of racism.
[01:36:02.813 --> 01:36:03.614]  Bring that sap to that.
[01:36:04.675 --> 01:36:06.556]  Put up a TCU BY yogurt or something.
[01:36:07.337 --> 01:36:10.440]  Everybody can get behind it.
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:12.342]  The truth has to be told about history.
[01:36:16.628 --> 01:36:21.854]  We have to make sure that these stories are told from our perspective.
[01:36:21.874 --> 01:36:22.955]  There's always hope, you know what I'm saying?
[01:36:22.975 --> 01:36:23.416]  We don't give up.
[01:36:23.856 --> 01:36:27.821]  It's about obliterating systemic and institutionalized racism.
[01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:32.806]  This is a wild place, y'all.
[01:36:32.886 --> 01:36:33.847]  It's a wild place.
[01:36:34.008 --> 01:36:37.792]  I know Harriet and Frederick be up there just like, what is they gonna do?
[01:36:41.818 --> 01:36:47.500]  All right, so I'm not a huge consumer of mainstream media, but I scan the internet.
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:48.900]  I flip the TV channels.
[01:36:50.420 --> 01:37:01.304]  And I want to just randomly at my house sometime with a camera crew, set up a camera, and then watch TV for two hours, flip around channels because about 80% of corporate spokespersons are black now.
[01:37:01.984 --> 01:37:03.944]  It's the same thing in Europe, Asia, everywhere.
[01:37:03.964 --> 01:37:11.676]   And That is coming from a place of the globalist putting on blackface.
[01:37:13.137 --> 01:37:23.245]  And the blackface they're putting on is about hiding their globalist corporate tyranny by first saying black people are victims and then white people are bad.
[01:37:23.665 --> 01:37:29.350]  And now the corporations speak for the black people to give them reparations.
[01:37:30.631 --> 01:37:35.975]  But really, it's attaching the globalist agenda on to the name of black people.
[01:37:37.446 --> 01:37:41.670]  It's absolute, complete, and total hijacking of a group of people.
[01:37:41.710 --> 01:37:42.811]  It's ridiculous.
[01:37:43.692 --> 01:37:46.274]  I mean, we're going to give $30 million of crack pipes to blacks?
[01:37:48.055 --> 01:37:48.596]  That's real.
[01:37:50.958 --> 01:37:56.963]  And the behavioral psychologists are coming up with things that sound insane to train you to accept the insane.
[01:37:56.983 --> 01:38:04.694]   Because they're getting ready to totally devalue your money, give you only power part of the day, Forcibly inject you.
[01:38:04.714 --> 01:38:06.075]  I mean, it's already here.
[01:38:06.095 --> 01:38:11.420]  And so they've got to normalize all of this insanity.
[01:38:14.022 --> 01:38:15.343]  It's the only way they can succeed.
[01:38:15.823 --> 01:38:25.991]  And I sit there and I've been around at big podcasts and big shows behind the scenes, some of the biggest black podcasters and some of the biggest black music people.
[01:38:26.752 --> 01:38:30.095]  And they literally like, Oh, some of us said it on TV.
[01:38:30.996 --> 01:38:31.857]  They've said it online.
[01:38:32.317 --> 01:38:39.883]  Alex Jones is just jealous of this show saying white people are evil because he's mad that black people are the dominant thing in the media.
[01:38:41.103 --> 01:38:42.384]  I'm like, what, real black people?
[01:38:42.544 --> 01:38:47.108]  I'd be fine with real black people getting elected to Congress or owning companies or having popular shows.
[01:38:47.128 --> 01:38:50.450]  They're sure a lot of black folks deserve to be the host of things and successful.
[01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:51.811]  I'm not debating that.
[01:38:52.211 --> 01:38:53.653]  You know, Jimi Hendrix playing the guitar.
[01:38:53.673 --> 01:38:53.713]  Dr.
[01:38:57.996 --> 01:39:01.819]  The head of the Trump medical operation, Ben Carson.
[01:39:02.199 --> 01:39:03.620]  That's not what we're talking about.
[01:39:04.561 --> 01:39:08.123]  We're talking about the corporate system.
[01:39:08.263 --> 01:39:12.926]  Why do I turn my TV on and I'm like four ads in a row?
[01:39:14.687 --> 01:39:16.569]  My daughter wanted to know about the Loch Ness Monster.
[01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.829]  Four years old.
[01:39:17.869 --> 01:39:30.791]   So I said, let me look in the TV guide and I found a history channel, or one of those channels, it was one of those channels, and it was about the Loch Ness Monster, so I hit the hour-long program, and it was like five minutes of show, four minutes of ads.
[01:39:31.371 --> 01:39:34.653]  Biggest amount of ads I ever saw, like 20-something minutes of ads an hour.
[01:39:36.854 --> 01:39:40.175]  And every ad was nothing but black people.
[01:39:41.756 --> 01:39:44.717]  And it wasn't black people are watching Loch Ness Monster shows.
[01:39:47.446 --> 01:39:50.707]  It's that every ad is that.
[01:39:51.227 --> 01:39:55.828]  So that when you're watching it, you're taught, you're white, you're guilty, you're evil, you've done wrong.
[01:39:56.368 --> 01:39:58.449]  And look, the black people are selling you insurance.
[01:39:58.789 --> 01:40:09.272]  And look, the black people are... And then Showtime, and the big mega-corporations, and all these channels, and all the comedians are, white people are evil, and America's racist, and America sucks.
[01:40:09.612 --> 01:40:13.613]  And now NPR says, using the wrong color emoji is racist.
[01:40:14.193 --> 01:40:16.514]  They're just sabotaging humanity.
[01:40:18.413 --> 01:40:19.514]  With Divide and Conquer.
[01:40:19.854 --> 01:40:21.915]  And I know this audience totally gets that.
[01:40:24.857 --> 01:40:30.341]  I know this audience is completely and totally aware of that.
[01:40:32.042 --> 01:40:37.625]  But at a certain point, it just makes my head spin how ridiculous this has all gotten.
[01:40:38.806 --> 01:40:45.238]   And imagine white people Are going to do one of three things watching shows like
[01:40:45.238 --> 01:40:49.688]   this that are on everywhere. You can't escape it They're going to say i'll submit to whatever the left says.
[01:40:49.688 --> 01:40:53.967]   I'm not a bad person I will see the left as my high priest. I will do whatever
[01:40:53.967 --> 01:41:01.117]   they say so that I will no longer be impure and bad And of course that's not to help black people that's to get
[01:41:01.117 --> 01:41:03.757]   you under the corporate control and occult doing what they say
[01:41:03.757 --> 01:41:10.257]   Or you're going to become Super anti-black and actually think the black people have
[01:41:10.257 --> 01:41:13.436]   taken everything over and are out to get you and now you're gonna do them
[01:41:13.436 --> 01:41:18.158]   but hate black people Or
[01:41:18.158 --> 01:41:23.378]   You're going to become depressed and just punch out of society and commit suicide or drink yourself to death and
[01:41:23.378 --> 01:41:29.038]   just Go away, which is what it's by the way this kind of stuff
[01:41:29.198 --> 01:41:41.299]   They've got studies and numbers out on it and Black people, in major studies, are rejecting race politics, and whites shouldn't be able to, you know, have the same rights, and numbers double what any other group are.
[01:41:41.739 --> 01:41:44.861]  Black people, twice the number of any other group, don't want to take the shots.
[01:41:45.161 --> 01:41:48.864]  Twice the number of any other group, don't believe all this propaganda that white people are the devil.
[01:41:49.921 --> 01:42:02.755]  So the left and these white scientists, they are mainly white, these social engineers, these social constructors, these behavioral psychologists, they're all trying to divide people, but the black folks on average see through it.
[01:42:03.636 --> 01:42:08.161]  So, you know, the actual black people see through this and reject it and don't believe it.
[01:42:10.003 --> 01:42:11.265]  But you know who does believe it.
[01:42:12.864 --> 01:42:18.865]  White women, 70% roughly, absolutely believe every damn thing they're told.
[01:42:19.165 --> 01:42:25.427]  Put a mask on your kid, take five shots, communism's good, white men are bad.
[01:42:25.447 --> 01:42:26.727]  I mean, can you imagine this?
[01:42:30.207 --> 01:42:31.748]  70% of white women believe whatever they're told.
[01:42:31.768 --> 01:42:36.649]  And it's like 50% of black women buy it too.
[01:42:38.029 --> 01:42:42.530]  About 30% of white men, about 20% of black men and women buy this.
[01:42:46.553 --> 01:42:49.477]  Depending on which study year number you look at, those are all just stalled numbers.
[01:42:50.299 --> 01:42:52.262]  I mean, this is just insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:52.882 --> 01:42:54.705]  This is cold-blooded social engineering.
[01:42:55.346 --> 01:42:56.728]  Cold-blooded divide and conquer.
[01:42:57.349 --> 01:43:01.695]  Cold-blooded turn us against each other, while the big mega-corporations rob the hell out of us.
[01:43:02.904 --> 01:43:06.385]  Wow, here we are on this February 10th Global Transmission.
[01:43:06.405 --> 01:43:07.185]  So honored to be here.
[01:43:07.565 --> 01:43:08.606]  What a great crew we've got.
[01:43:08.866 --> 01:43:11.546]  I want to take calls in the next 30 minutes, a little bit the next hour.
[01:43:12.007 --> 01:43:13.007]  Paul Watson takes over.
[01:43:13.047 --> 01:43:13.807]  But here's the number.
[01:43:14.627 --> 01:43:15.948]  Let's take seven, eight calls.
[01:43:16.528 --> 01:43:17.368]  I'll get to that many.
[01:43:17.408 --> 01:43:18.168]  I want to hear from you.
[01:43:18.908 --> 01:43:20.729]  This Saturday, I'm coming in to do a live show.
[01:43:21.835 --> 01:43:25.622]  I said I'd do one last Saturday and then stuff came up, but I'm going to put these in.
[01:43:26.062 --> 01:43:30.911]  I normally show up when I say I am for a special show, but this Saturday I forgot I had a bunch of stuff I had to take care of.
[01:43:31.572 --> 01:43:35.398]  I'm busier than a one-legged man, as they know, in an ass-kicking contest.
[01:43:36.198 --> 01:43:41.842]  But I do want to give the number out for whatever you want to cover, whatever you want to get into, any of the issues we've raised.
[01:43:42.202 --> 01:43:43.123]  So free for all, 877-789-2539.
[01:43:43.143 --> 01:43:43.423]  877-789-Alex.
[01:43:43.443 --> 01:43:43.483]  877-789-2539.
[01:43:43.363 --> 01:43:54.142]   877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539, and we'll take four or five of your calls
[01:43:54.142 --> 01:43:58.222]  each segment until Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[01:43:58.222 --> 01:44:02.663]   All right, you know, I'm aware of psychology because I live it.
[01:44:02.939 --> 01:44:06.540]  I mean, everything I tell you, I got the same problems you got.
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:13.721]  So as we all know, what we should do versus what we do is two different enchiladas.
[01:44:14.481 --> 01:44:16.722]  So when I'm bossing you around, I'm not bossing you around.
[01:44:16.782 --> 01:44:18.602]  I'm putting suggestions out to all of us.
[01:44:19.242 --> 01:44:20.462]  And here's where I really dropped the ball.
[01:44:21.983 --> 01:44:22.803]  And I knew this was happening.
[01:44:22.823 --> 01:44:24.483]  I said this over a year ago when it started.
[01:44:26.064 --> 01:44:28.224]  There's going to get a point because that's how we're designed.
[01:44:31.803 --> 01:44:45.807]  That there's so many soccer players and football players and baseball players and little kids and old people and everybody else dying from these deadly shots that they knew in their own documents in October of 2020 and the CDC would cause heart attacks, myocarditis and blood clots and all the rest of it.
[01:44:47.528 --> 01:44:51.069]  That we will get to a point where we don't even care anymore.
[01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:52.329]  And I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:44:53.206 --> 01:45:02.993]  I'm strong enough-minded to fight the globalists and the Great Reset and the New World Order and the pedophile rings, but I could not handle all this death if my brain didn't just get to where it doesn't care.
[01:45:03.553 --> 01:45:04.594]  So my soul cares!
[01:45:06.555 --> 01:45:14.861]  But it's looking through the rose-colored darkly in my brain, and I'm just like, okay, yeah, I got like six, seven articles a day about little kids dying from shots.
[01:45:15.761 --> 01:45:17.402]  I don't really want to watch this video.
[01:45:17.903 --> 01:45:19.464]  I don't want to talk about this dead kid.
[01:45:19.884 --> 01:45:21.525]  Not because I don't care about this little kid.
[01:45:21.925 --> 01:45:22.806]  It's the opposite!
[01:45:26.291 --> 01:45:26.871]  But you know what?
[01:45:27.592 --> 01:45:30.014]  It's not my body running this show, it's my spirit.
[01:45:32.296 --> 01:45:35.458]  And my spirit says, get in there and cover this right now.
[01:45:39.241 --> 01:45:39.941]  So, here it is.
[01:45:39.961 --> 01:45:44.645]  I mean, you can go watch the videos about these kids, hear about them, who they were and who their parents are.
[01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:49.849]  Then I feel incredibly guilty that we couldn't stop this, you know?
[01:45:50.509 --> 01:45:52.451]  I mean, this is just one of the articles.
[01:45:52.511 --> 01:45:54.913]  I saw at least six in the stack, folks.
[01:45:56.573 --> 01:45:58.094]  You know we hear about one out of a hundred, right?
[01:45:59.054 --> 01:46:00.794]  That these... But Fauci, does he care?
[01:46:00.834 --> 01:46:03.855]  Oh, he's smiling like a pig and you know what?
[01:46:03.975 --> 01:46:05.516]  Oh, it's so funny.
[01:46:05.936 --> 01:46:07.617]  He's like a dog in a butcher shop.
[01:46:07.797 --> 01:46:09.437]  Oh, it's so cute.
[01:46:11.058 --> 01:46:13.538]  Oh, it's so much fun to not have a soul, I guess.
[01:46:14.459 --> 01:46:14.919]  But it's not.
[01:46:17.230 --> 01:46:20.815]  Not normal, is the headline on Infowars.com by Kellan McBreen.
[01:46:21.095 --> 01:46:28.284]  Two high school baseball players collapse mid-game and die on the same day.
[01:46:30.847 --> 01:46:33.870]  See, now when all these people are dying, I don't even cover it.
[01:46:34.451 --> 01:46:36.634]  But oh, it's two on the same day, well then we gotta cover it.
[01:46:37.955 --> 01:46:39.815]  And as the deaths mount, we just get normal.
[01:46:40.296 --> 01:46:42.196]  We just normalize it, which is the globalist's one.
[01:46:42.656 --> 01:46:44.316]  They know we're just going to get used to it.
[01:46:44.336 --> 01:46:46.617]  And no, no, I will not adapt to this.
[01:46:46.977 --> 01:46:48.077]  I will not accept this.
[01:46:48.197 --> 01:46:49.418]  I will not become numb to this.
[01:46:49.798 --> 01:46:50.998]  I will not be part of this.
[01:46:51.758 --> 01:46:53.218]  Well, Jones, you didn't kill these kids.
[01:46:55.839 --> 01:46:56.319]  Yeah, I did.
[01:46:56.719 --> 01:46:57.319]  And so did you.
[01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:00.180]  Sure, we're not as guilty as some.
[01:47:01.428 --> 01:47:03.949]  And as FIFA Vedetta says, they will be held accountable.
[01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:06.930]  But yeah, you look in the mirror, I'm guilty for this.
[01:47:07.330 --> 01:47:09.651]  And I don't, I'm not a hate-me-hit-myself person.
[01:47:09.931 --> 01:47:10.531]  But you know what?
[01:47:10.711 --> 01:47:15.073]  My soul tells me I haven't done enough because I haven't done enough, damn it!
[01:47:17.714 --> 01:47:20.615]  And some jackass Baptist out there, I'm not attacking Baptists, but you know what I mean.
[01:47:20.935 --> 01:47:22.316]  Oh, you shouldn't say damn!
[01:47:22.556 --> 01:47:25.457]  Well, you shouldn't sit on your ass while this is all going on!
[01:47:29.346 --> 01:47:30.287]  Not normal!
[01:47:30.988 --> 01:47:37.374]  Two high school basketball players collapse mid-game and die on the same day.
[01:47:40.197 --> 01:47:41.959]  Is this the new normal we have to get used to?
[01:47:42.239 --> 01:47:45.923]  And now there's articles and billboards and signs on buses.
[01:47:46.644 --> 01:47:48.666]  Oh, heart attacks are really normal now.
[01:47:48.946 --> 01:47:51.649]  They're way up because of stress from the lockdown.
[01:47:52.169 --> 01:47:52.750]  Yeah, right.
[01:47:54.503 --> 01:47:59.767]  A pair of teenagers from different states both collapsed and died during their high school basketball games on Tuesday.
[01:47:59.807 --> 01:48:01.928]  That would normally happen maybe once every three or four years.
[01:48:01.948 --> 01:48:02.769]  It would be a huge story.
[01:48:04.990 --> 01:48:12.115]  Texas sophomore, I remember I was like 10 years old and some, I forget his name, black kid died on the basketball court.
[01:48:12.135 --> 01:48:13.996]  There was a huge investigation of how he died.
[01:48:14.016 --> 01:48:17.278]  I mean, it was like a big thing, because nobody was dying.
[01:48:17.419 --> 01:48:19.200]  But, you know, now it's like every five minutes.
[01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:20.160]  Big deal.
[01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:20.941]  Just get over it.
[01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:32.765]  Texas sophomore Devontae Murphy and Illinois senior Cameron Wesley both passed away on the same day.
[01:48:33.566 --> 01:48:39.889]  Murphy, you attended Alto High School, named All District 22-2A Newcomer of the New Year.
[01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:45.172]  You couldn't have met a better kid, Murphy's cousin told Jessica, the Tyler Morning Telegraph.
[01:48:46.383 --> 01:48:48.104]  He had respect.
[01:48:48.264 --> 01:48:50.465]  I never saw him with an attitude.
[01:48:50.946 --> 01:48:52.867]  He was the kind of kid who touched everybody.
[01:48:53.307 --> 01:48:56.328]  Family and friends were most important to Vontae.
[01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:58.269]  She said he was a good kid.
[01:48:58.730 --> 01:49:00.191]  This all feels like a dream.
[01:49:00.591 --> 01:49:01.551]  It doesn't feel real.
[01:49:01.831 --> 01:49:04.553]  You've got to have the government and big tech killing and the other dead kid.
[01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:09.876]  Go read the article right now.
[01:49:10.828 --> 01:49:14.030]  And you know, it's just like those kids are just pieces of trash.
[01:49:14.350 --> 01:49:14.811]  You know what?
[01:49:14.831 --> 01:49:15.331]  They're dead.
[01:49:15.371 --> 01:49:16.292]  You shut up about it.
[01:49:16.332 --> 01:49:17.112]  Take your shot.
[01:49:17.353 --> 01:49:19.353]  Geraldo Rivera said so.
[01:49:19.353 --> 01:49:27.353]  I got a whole stack of other dead kids right here.
[01:49:27.353 --> 01:49:37.353]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:32.443]  You want to hear about them?
[01:49:32.563 --> 01:49:33.504]  Yeah, screw them, right?
[01:49:33.524 --> 01:49:33.724]  Yeah.
[01:49:34.793 --> 01:49:38.316]  By the way, it takes him a couple days of incredible pain with myocarditis.
[01:49:38.717 --> 01:49:43.081]  Like, full-grown adults have heart attacks like 10 minutes long, you know, you black out, it hurts so bad.
[01:49:43.541 --> 01:49:49.907]  Imagine a day or two of your heart, your big, healthy, young heart swelling and seizing up in you into excruciating pain.
[01:49:50.387 --> 01:49:51.508]  And then you die.
[01:49:52.389 --> 01:49:54.591]  And Bill Gates sits there and smirks.
[01:49:54.611 --> 01:49:57.534]  Because that's what makes him feel good.
[01:49:59.275 --> 01:50:00.636]  But you know who's worse than Bill Gates?
[01:50:01.786 --> 01:50:13.169]  Those of us that have read his writings and know about his father and grandfather and his mother and all the things he said he wanted to do to us, and the fact that we sit here and we let him do this to us, we are worse than Bill Gates.
[01:50:13.309 --> 01:50:14.610]  We killed those children.
[01:50:15.550 --> 01:50:21.972]  We let that murdering sack of filth do whatever he wants because we were too weak-minded to admit it.
[01:50:22.932 --> 01:50:24.573]  And he believes we won't stop him.
[01:50:24.933 --> 01:50:29.674]  He believes we're going to bow to him forever, but he will be broken.
[01:50:30.715 --> 01:50:38.622]   He will be Destroyed by the will of God for what he's done, but it's those of us here on earth.
[01:50:38.682 --> 01:50:40.023]  It's our job to prepare the way.
[01:50:40.043 --> 01:50:45.226]  All right, folks, we're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:46.487 --> 01:50:48.048]  We're going to Josh in Florida in a moment.
[01:50:48.772 --> 01:50:54.115]  All right, Josh, John, Jack, Jeremiah, Jordan, Patty, Ray, Chris, we're going to all your calls.
[01:50:54.695 --> 01:50:57.836]  Head of Paul Joseph Watson joining us here in about 30 minutes.
[01:50:58.397 --> 01:51:01.018]  Right now, let's go to Josh in Florida.
[01:51:01.038 --> 01:51:03.919]  Let's talk about cyber attacks to be blamed on Russia.
[01:51:04.179 --> 01:51:05.560]  Yeah, that's all pre-programmed.
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:07.221]  That's their next big move.
[01:51:07.541 --> 01:51:08.461]  How do you know their move?
[01:51:08.481 --> 01:51:09.542]  Well, it's a big world.
[01:51:09.562 --> 01:51:11.203]  A lot of people, they have to pre-program it.
[01:51:11.503 --> 01:51:14.664]  And if you know what you're looking for, you can see it all being prepared.
[01:51:14.684 --> 01:51:15.625]  So give us your take on that.
[01:51:17.631 --> 01:51:23.454]  Yeah, Alex, first of all, the vitamin mineral fusion, bone broth and iodine changed my life.
[01:51:24.134 --> 01:51:26.455]  So great products, keep it up.
[01:51:26.675 --> 01:51:28.516]  Thank you, sir.
[01:51:28.616 --> 01:51:38.421]  Back in December, I had called in and talked about the white paper called Securing the Net from the Brookings Institute written in 2013.
[01:51:39.381 --> 01:51:44.583]  And that white paper is called Securing the Net Global Governments in the Digital Domain 2022.
[01:51:46.750 --> 01:52:02.714]  And in that white paper, I have it all documented, if you don't mind me giving a plug to my blog, TheGoodFightNews.com, it's all there, everything's sourced, and it basically says, in one of their scenarios, conflict with the U.S.
[01:52:02.774 --> 01:52:05.974]  and China is going to lead to the collapse of e-commerce.
[01:52:06.895 --> 01:52:10.535]  And then this all dovetails to exactly what you're saying.
[01:52:11.276 --> 01:52:12.016]  How do we know?
[01:52:12.096 --> 01:52:13.156]  This is not prophecy.
[01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:18.023]  This is something that they plan and they war game over and over again.
[01:52:18.043 --> 01:52:26.308]  So we're going to see more things like the Colonial Pipeline start to happen and it's going to be shutdowns, lockdowns.
[01:52:26.328 --> 01:52:35.855]  We might see like a few day blackout on the Internet and I'm pretty sure they're going to position that with what's going on in Ukraine now.
[01:52:36.415 --> 01:52:36.835]  That's right.
[01:52:36.915 --> 01:52:44.222]   They've run their virus hoax fear until it Yes, so in 2021 as well, we also saw a meat processor get hacked.
[01:52:44.042 --> 01:52:46.401]  they're backing off in words only.
[01:52:46.401 --> 01:52:51.921]   But now they're gonna launch the cyber attacks, the wars, all of that is here, yes.
[01:52:51.921 --> 01:53:00.221]   Yeah, so in 2021 as well, we also saw the meat processor get hacked.
[01:53:00.221 --> 01:53:08.142]   We're gonna see blockchain and cryptocurrency wallets start to shut down because they have to rein in that
[01:53:08.142 --> 01:53:15.881]   and bring in their digital currency, which is all gonna be under one protocol now.
[01:53:16.503 --> 01:53:18.624]  By the way, I meant to lead the show with that today.
[01:53:20.424 --> 01:53:32.948]  The same Atlantic Council, it's the mouthpiece of this thing, the same guy that called for the arrest of anybody that questions lockdowns, with the head of Pfizer, they said, oh, the global government is about to be here, and the global currency is about to be here.
[01:53:33.388 --> 01:53:35.489]  So you're absolutely right, they're getting all that ready.
[01:53:36.970 --> 01:53:40.431]  Yeah, so let me quote something from that Brookings Institute document from 2013.
[01:53:42.111 --> 01:54:12.461]   It says, an incubation period during which a steadily growing Dino-American, which is China-American tensions, led to an outbreak phase of cybercrime, which led to a collapse of e-commerce and forced the government, overwhelmed by the number of crimes, to come together to Finally, the passing phase of the old internet is initiated by Russia, China, and Germany following a global panic during a brief period of cyber terror.
[01:54:13.142 --> 01:54:16.625]  These are all quoted, I have it all linked up, documented.
[01:54:16.645 --> 01:54:25.552]  Now you're right, and then Schwab is on TV drooling saying, we will take over and save the earth because of cyber attack.
[01:54:28.634 --> 01:54:29.454]  And that's the plan.
[01:54:29.494 --> 01:54:32.055]  So the next lockdown will be internet lockdowns.
[01:54:32.335 --> 01:54:35.716]  And ever since I called you in December, you've really been hitting that.
[01:54:35.756 --> 01:54:37.516]  So I appreciate you for... No, you're right.
[01:54:37.576 --> 01:54:41.517]  And then when people don't have food, they'll say, sign on to a carpet score.
[01:54:41.837 --> 01:54:42.797]  We'll deliver you food.
[01:54:42.817 --> 01:54:45.278]  But now you've got to agree to be tracked and controlled by us forever.
[01:54:45.618 --> 01:54:46.798]  And now you're a broken slave.
[01:54:46.918 --> 01:54:47.738]  Thank you, Josh.
[01:54:48.058 --> 01:54:49.018]  Yeah, we're here, folks.
[01:54:50.539 --> 01:54:51.719]  We can stop it together, though.
[01:54:52.639 --> 01:54:53.899]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:54:53.979 --> 01:54:55.100]  John in Nebraska.
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:55.640]  You're on the air.
[01:54:55.660 --> 01:54:56.120]  Welcome, John.
[01:54:57.498 --> 01:54:58.839]  Oh, yeah, Alex.
[01:54:58.939 --> 01:55:00.899]  Been listening to you since the late 90s.
[01:55:01.039 --> 01:55:04.301]  Second time I've called in in 23 years.
[01:55:04.581 --> 01:55:05.481]  Good to have you here, brother.
[01:55:06.182 --> 01:55:06.762]  Thanks, buddy.
[01:55:07.422 --> 01:55:15.405]  An hour ago, you mentioned the term Rosetta Stone being the key to getting this thing out there, getting the info out.
[01:55:16.005 --> 01:55:17.266]  I had a little brainstorm.
[01:55:18.026 --> 01:55:22.368]  The Rosetta Stone is the Georgia Guidestones.
[01:55:24.369 --> 01:55:24.849]  Tell me more.
[01:55:26.966 --> 01:55:29.687]  Well, you know about the Georgia Guidestones, don't you?
[01:55:30.287 --> 01:55:32.768]  They want to bring us down to half a billion.
[01:55:33.889 --> 01:55:35.670]  It's depopulation.
[01:55:36.370 --> 01:55:39.071]  Force Vax equals depopulation.
[01:55:39.611 --> 01:55:41.692]  See the Georgia Guidestones.
[01:55:42.832 --> 01:55:54.169]   So how about, you know, instead of Let's Go Brandon at stadiums, Georgia Guidestones Oh, that'd be a great idea.
[01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:56.010]  Let's go Guidestones!
[01:55:56.330 --> 01:55:59.131]  Because if people awake to the depopulation plan, they'll see it all.
[01:55:59.151 --> 01:55:59.611]  I agree.
[01:56:00.291 --> 01:56:04.572]  Not let's go, no, just Georgia Guidestones.
[01:56:04.592 --> 01:56:09.973]  No, here, we don't, when we say let's go, Brandon, we're hating Joe Biden, but yeah, exactly.
[01:56:10.013 --> 01:56:11.754]  Georgia Guidestones.
[01:56:12.254 --> 01:56:13.254]  There you go, buddy.
[01:56:13.554 --> 01:56:24.949]   If that, if you get that on Tucker a half dozen times, or Joe, and half the country knows about it, and half the country checks out what these Fine folks, you're doing to us.
[01:56:25.509 --> 01:56:27.610]  That might be the Rosetta Stone.
[01:56:29.291 --> 01:56:30.371]  John, so good to hear from you.
[01:56:30.391 --> 01:56:31.191]  Anything else on your mind?
[01:56:32.072 --> 01:56:35.793]  No, but I'm from Omaha and just wanted to say hi, neighbor.
[01:56:36.554 --> 01:56:37.354]  God bless you, brother.
[01:56:37.394 --> 01:56:38.194]  My wife's from Omaha.
[01:56:38.214 --> 01:56:39.175]  We really appreciate you.
[01:56:39.795 --> 01:56:41.475]  All right, let's go to the next caller here.
[01:56:42.256 --> 01:56:44.977]  Let's talk to a caller in Boston.
[01:56:45.557 --> 01:56:47.058]  Let's talk to Patty in Boston.
[01:56:47.098 --> 01:56:47.658]  Welcome, Patty.
[01:56:49.639 --> 01:56:50.780]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:56:50.820 --> 01:57:00.349]  I just wanted to let you know that you guys have a kind of a jacked-up headline that says, on InfoWars.com, not normal!
[01:57:01.450 --> 01:57:06.515]  Two high school basketball players collapse mid-game and die on same day.
[01:57:06.875 --> 01:57:13.841]  But then buried in the text of the article, it says, the team's vaccination statuses are unknown.
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:17.785]  And autopsy reports have yet to be released.
[01:57:18.386 --> 01:57:25.198]  I fail to see how this is even a story when you're saying you have absolutely no idea.
[01:57:25.811 --> 01:57:27.493]  Why these kids died.
[01:57:27.573 --> 01:57:30.556]  It's obviously a tragedy and we all accept that.
[01:57:30.576 --> 01:57:31.356]  Let me just be clear.
[01:57:32.077 --> 01:57:33.779]  I just read the headline in some of the article.
[01:57:33.799 --> 01:57:34.259]  I'll check it.
[01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:45.510]  So you're saying there isn't a 500% increase in sports people having heart attacks and there's not advisories on the Moderna and Pfizer shot now saying it can cause heart attacks and myocarditis.
[01:57:45.730 --> 01:57:47.612]  Are you saying that's just totally made up?
[01:57:47.632 --> 01:57:48.253]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:57:49.795 --> 01:57:55.760]  What you're saying is that myocarditis is actually often caused by the virus itself, not the vaccination.
[01:57:55.780 --> 01:58:06.730]  Yeah, well I've actually had medical doctors on, like Dr. Peter McCullough and others, and they say there's actually a name now specifically for vaccine-induced myocarditis.
[01:58:07.010 --> 01:58:12.095]  So the insurance company owners, about a 40% increase in death, is that made up too?
[01:58:13.502 --> 01:58:20.105]  Well, I'm saying there's actually a name for headlines like this one, which is called... Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:58:20.466 --> 01:58:21.506]  I will look into that, sir.
[01:58:21.846 --> 01:58:23.707]  But I know seminar calls when I hear them, okay?
[01:58:24.668 --> 01:58:26.429]  On agenda... Hey, listen.
[01:58:26.789 --> 01:58:27.369]  Listen, you're right.
[01:58:27.689 --> 01:58:28.650]  Lockdowns are good.
[01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:30.091]  Masks are good.
[01:58:30.271 --> 01:58:31.311]  Klaus Schwab's good.
[01:58:31.872 --> 01:58:34.193]  These vaccines really work well, gene therapies.
[01:58:35.239 --> 01:58:37.040]  We don't have all the scientists warning their problems.
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:40.902]  We don't have, you know, the people that worked at these actual companies saying they're bad.
[01:58:40.942 --> 01:58:41.362]  You're right.
[01:58:41.582 --> 01:58:42.763]  Everything's fine, sir.
[01:58:42.783 --> 01:58:44.604]  All right, we're gonna move quick through the calls.
[01:58:45.064 --> 01:58:46.345]  Ray in Arkansas.
[01:58:46.365 --> 01:58:46.885]  You're on the air.
[01:58:46.945 --> 01:58:47.445]  Welcome, Ray.
[01:58:49.806 --> 01:58:50.527]  Hey, what's up, man?
[01:58:50.907 --> 01:58:51.407]  Welcome, brother.
[01:58:51.447 --> 01:58:51.747]  Go ahead.
[01:58:53.228 --> 01:58:55.949]  I just wanted to ask you, I wanted to mention two things to you, man.
[01:58:56.129 --> 01:59:13.719]   In Osceola, Arkansas, here in Mississippi County, Arkansas, whenever you go to court, anything you go to court for, Uh, they're immediately offering you, as you stand in front of the judge, they're offering up to $200 off of your fine, uh, just to get the vaccine, and I just feel like that's kind of targeting poor people.
[01:59:13.999 --> 01:59:15.240]  Oh, that's super creepy.
[01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:20.384]  Well, I mean, it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy linked to infertility, heart attacks, and blood clots.
[01:59:20.644 --> 01:59:21.605]  That's on the insert.
[01:59:21.865 --> 01:59:25.067]  The last caller can try to obfuscate about that, but it's on the insert.
[01:59:26.608 --> 01:59:35.461]   Yeah, and another thing is, it's just whenever the judicial system is also pushing around people who are, um, who can't afford to pay their fines and you know they're
[01:59:35.461 --> 01:59:40.101]   giving out a free vaccine for them to get 200 knocked off and oftentimes 200 dollars may be the
[01:59:40.101 --> 01:59:45.752]   difference in going to jail or not so countless people are getting this vaccine just for the sake
[01:59:45.752 --> 01:59:50.512]   of it. Well again and again I hear you calling them vaccine I do too they're not vaccines they're
[01:59:50.512 --> 01:59:55.391]   gene therapies and in the year of the vaccine we had way more deaths in the year before the
[01:59:55.391 --> 02:00:05.112]   vaccine what do you make of that? Well I'm sorry what was that again?
[02:00:05.271 --> 02:00:06.772]  I thought you broke out on me.
[02:00:06.972 --> 02:00:07.973]  Ray, I appreciate your call.
[02:00:07.993 --> 02:00:08.574]  God bless you.
[02:00:08.914 --> 02:00:13.917]  Chris, Jordan, Jeremiah, Jack, we're going to take your call straight ahead.
[02:00:13.937 --> 02:00:15.558]  Infowars.com.
[02:00:15.899 --> 02:00:17.820]  Free speech is command base.
[02:00:19.081 --> 02:00:21.462]  We must join with Sauron.
[02:00:22.503 --> 02:00:29.308]  So said those who believe they had greater knowledge and who believe the greatest power on this earth was Satan.
[02:00:30.672 --> 02:00:43.317]  But Satan was defeated and thrown down and broken of old and only set about in the office by God as the tester of the children of God and the faithful.
[02:00:45.178 --> 02:00:46.258]  That is his office.
[02:00:47.599 --> 02:00:50.000]  Our office is the stars.
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:01:08.897]   Should we decide to take that birthright on and begin the transcendence The children of Satan believe only once they've exterminated and cleared the planet of their opposition will they be given the birthright of power.
[02:01:10.438 --> 02:01:16.739]  We're taking your phone calls right now on this live February 10th worldwide broadcast.
[02:01:17.819 --> 02:01:20.020]  Let's go to the order these calls have been received.
[02:01:20.820 --> 02:01:23.841]  Let's go to Jeremiah in California.
[02:01:23.861 --> 02:01:24.881]  Jeremiah, thanks for holding.
[02:01:24.901 --> 02:01:25.181]  Go ahead.
[02:01:26.764 --> 02:01:31.065]  Alex, hey, first off, I'd thank you for all you do, but I know you don't got time to hear that.
[02:01:31.325 --> 02:01:35.906]  What I do want to thank you for is getting on Cozy.tv and representing Roypers.
[02:01:36.106 --> 02:01:37.527]  We'd love to have you on.
[02:01:37.567 --> 02:01:39.988]  You got almost 800 viewers right now.
[02:01:40.548 --> 02:01:41.428]  Going crazy.
[02:01:42.348 --> 02:01:43.048]  Sure, sure.
[02:01:43.088 --> 02:01:45.909]  We're on a lot of great independent platforms that are popping up.
[02:01:46.529 --> 02:01:46.969]  What is this?
[02:01:48.990 --> 02:01:50.710]  Cozy.tv.
[02:01:50.850 --> 02:01:51.310]  Oh, yeah.
[02:01:53.894 --> 02:01:55.395]  Nick Fuentes is a great platform.
[02:01:55.895 --> 02:01:56.656]  Tell us about it again.
[02:01:56.996 --> 02:01:58.077]  How do people follow that?
[02:01:59.438 --> 02:02:04.741]  You could go to your browser, type in Cozy.tv slash Alex Jones.
[02:02:05.262 --> 02:02:06.342]  Live right now.
[02:02:06.562 --> 02:02:07.423]  Oh yeah, it's first rate.
[02:02:07.483 --> 02:02:08.924]  It's got great live commenting.
[02:02:08.964 --> 02:02:09.745]  It's really exploding.
[02:02:10.245 --> 02:02:11.826]  In fact, somebody sent me a link like a week ago.
[02:02:11.846 --> 02:02:14.107]  Like Fuentes has like a hundred thousand people on or something.
[02:02:14.127 --> 02:02:14.708]  That's great.
[02:02:15.989 --> 02:02:16.889]  It's no joke.
[02:02:16.929 --> 02:02:18.350]  And it's all organic growth.
[02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:19.431]  We've got a great team.
[02:02:20.477 --> 02:02:21.938]  So we really appreciate you having us.
[02:02:22.198 --> 02:02:24.679]  No, no, let me put you on hold and I want to get Fuentes on.
[02:02:24.699 --> 02:02:25.619]  I want to talk to you at the show.
[02:02:26.059 --> 02:02:27.400]  I love what you guys are doing.
[02:02:27.420 --> 02:02:32.022]  You know, we got live streaming with comments ready soon as well, but I'm not in competition.
[02:02:32.602 --> 02:02:33.802]  I want more diversity.
[02:02:34.082 --> 02:02:35.243]  I mean, that is just beautiful.
[02:02:35.743 --> 02:02:36.944]  What's on your mind, Jeremiah?
[02:02:38.344 --> 02:02:45.927]  That's the beauty of what's happening is human consciousness, like you talk about in Reset Wars, is rising so exponentially, they cannot keep up.
[02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:46.640]  Right?
[02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:48.182]  I wanted to talk to you about Bill Gates.
[02:02:48.242 --> 02:02:50.444]  I was up in San Francisco last week for an interview.
[02:02:50.464 --> 02:02:51.745]  I'm a tech recruiter.
[02:02:52.065 --> 02:02:55.548]  They are building chips, Alex, that are trying to break Moore's Law.
[02:02:55.628 --> 02:02:58.471]  He is putting tons, a billion dollar chip war.
[02:02:58.611 --> 02:03:02.795]  Intel just invested $20 billion into a site here in the US.
[02:03:03.295 --> 02:03:07.880]  Huge chip wars to really advance this technology to upload our consciousness.
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:12.704]  And I think the more younger people can understand this naturally, they're going to reject it.
[02:03:13.533 --> 02:03:16.234]  Well, explain what Moore's Law is and what they're trying to do.
[02:03:17.515 --> 02:03:25.680]  Moore's Law essentially says that technology, chip power, memory, RAM processing speed, it doubles every two years.
[02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:29.722]  This is a law that's been around since Intel created the first chip back in the 60s.
[02:03:30.242 --> 02:03:34.284]  This is what they have to break in order to take everything to that next level.
[02:03:36.646 --> 02:03:37.406]  And have they done it?
[02:03:39.286 --> 02:03:47.608]  They basically, they explained it to me, they said they've got the car ready to go, they have the keys and the ignition, but they basically have to work out all of the kink.
[02:03:47.748 --> 02:03:50.269]  This was the analogy they gave me.
[02:03:50.289 --> 02:03:52.710]  A lot of different companies, a lot of different startups out there.
[02:03:52.750 --> 02:03:57.251]  Well yeah, that's the Atlantean moment, is when it's so sophisticated no one can control it.
[02:03:59.211 --> 02:03:59.792]  Exactly.
[02:04:00.152 --> 02:04:04.253]  And this is what they want, because we're cheap, we're useless, we're just bottom feeders to them.
[02:04:05.784 --> 02:04:08.585]  I think Canada has proven that that's not the case.
[02:04:08.585 --> 02:04:11.623]  Also, we make the decision about our own environment.
[02:04:11.623 --> 02:04:14.364]  We don't have to deploy things that make us obsolete.
[02:04:14.364 --> 02:04:16.064]  We don't have to stop farming ourselves.
[02:04:16.064 --> 02:04:19.224]  We don't have to have robots do it while we watch Netflix.
[02:04:19.224 --> 02:04:23.983]   We have to decide, no, we want a pro-human future and we want to incrementally, to use
[02:04:23.983 --> 02:04:29.385]   the Frank Herbert parallel, bring in technology selectively where it doesn't enslave us but
[02:04:29.385 --> 02:04:31.585]  it empowers us, where it serves us.
[02:04:31.673 --> 02:04:37.916]  It's that decision and that divine spark of creation that allows us to control it.
[02:04:38.136 --> 02:04:44.000]  But the behavioral psychologist on the left says, you're animals, you have no free will, just give way to our machines.
[02:04:44.140 --> 02:04:44.680]  Screw them!
[02:04:46.070 --> 02:04:46.630]  Exactly.
[02:04:46.911 --> 02:04:47.471]  Exactly.
[02:04:47.891 --> 02:04:49.032]  God is on our side.
[02:04:49.072 --> 02:04:50.333]  The truth always prevails.
[02:04:50.353 --> 02:04:51.814]  It's darkest before the dawn.
[02:04:51.934 --> 02:04:53.695]  And hey, Jeremiah was a prophet.
[02:04:53.956 --> 02:04:54.616]  I'm just saying.
[02:04:54.936 --> 02:04:55.797]  God bless you, Jeremiah.
[02:04:55.837 --> 02:04:56.818]  I'm going to get you on hold.
[02:04:56.838 --> 02:05:00.020]  I want to talk to you about the Nick Fuentes thing, and if you can help us with IT stuff.
[02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:01.861]  Because we have great IT, but we need to go quick.
[02:05:01.881 --> 02:05:02.642]  We need to build fast.
[02:05:02.662 --> 02:05:04.042]  We need to do a lot of stuff here.
[02:05:04.583 --> 02:05:05.544]  So, very exciting.
[02:05:05.824 --> 02:05:06.864]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[02:05:08.223 --> 02:05:10.044]  Jordan in New Jersey.
[02:05:10.185 --> 02:05:13.307]  Jordan, your governor's backing off all the tyranny right now.
[02:05:13.327 --> 02:05:14.288]  There's a massive awakening.
[02:05:14.588 --> 02:05:15.228]  Good to talk to you.
[02:05:15.268 --> 02:05:18.751]  What's your view on the situation with the vaccines and the mRNA?
[02:05:20.492 --> 02:05:21.693]  Yes, thanks Alex.
[02:05:21.933 --> 02:05:22.874]  Peace to you, brother Alex.
[02:05:24.773 --> 02:05:35.000]  So, I just wanted to say, you know, we kind of need to move toward a unified field theory as they move away from these restrictions as to what was actually deployed on the public.
[02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:43.065]  And I've talked to you several times, I don't know if you remember me, I talked in September about some of the graphene oxide aspect of it.
[02:05:43.165 --> 02:05:44.666]  No, I do remember your call, and you're right.
[02:05:44.686 --> 02:05:50.050]  We need to not be, oh, they're getting off our back, we need to be, how do we bring them to justice so they don't launch the next attack?
[02:05:51.121 --> 02:05:52.022]  Yeah, precisely.
[02:05:52.042 --> 02:05:54.563]  And I want to state this emphatically, okay?
[02:05:55.383 --> 02:05:57.384]  Nuremberg was a failure, okay?
[02:05:58.025 --> 02:06:00.626]  The people, the actual culprits got away.
[02:06:00.646 --> 02:06:02.347]  32,000 Nazis were brought here and got away.
[02:06:03.747 --> 02:06:14.453]  That too, but all the heads of IG Farben, the people that paid to build the damn camps, and have... You're right, all the corporate leaders that made the money and ran it, they all got scot-free.
[02:06:15.569 --> 02:06:17.190]  Yes, a slap on the wrist.
[02:06:17.251 --> 02:06:19.733]  They spent like a year in a villa outside of Berlin.
[02:06:20.213 --> 02:06:30.382]  And then they all became heads of major corporations in the new Marshall Plan Europe, which was something that they were able to do because Hitler rewrote that entire continent due to that war.
[02:06:31.082 --> 02:06:32.823]  Now, and people have to understand this, too.
[02:06:32.883 --> 02:06:35.424]  Joseph Mengeleff was taking orders from Bayer Pharmaceuticals.
[02:06:35.924 --> 02:06:42.167]  And the ADL is complicit in covering up that these were ridiculous experiments and no one knows why they were doing them.
[02:06:42.267 --> 02:06:42.768]  No, you're right.
[02:06:42.808 --> 02:06:44.809]  And the Nazis had networks to control Europe.
[02:06:45.249 --> 02:06:49.211]  The United States took that over and kept those networks in place on record.
[02:06:49.511 --> 02:06:51.672]  And that's the EU today was a Nazi blueprint.
[02:06:52.825 --> 02:06:53.245]  Correct.
[02:06:53.505 --> 02:07:04.167]  And there was a big transfer of uranium, too, with elements of the Nazis that led to the first Trinity bomb, because they didn't have the amount of uranium they needed to make the plutonium, and so forth.
[02:07:04.587 --> 02:07:10.169]  So this is all chronicled, and you can even go see it on Wikipedia, because people don't understand this.
[02:07:10.209 --> 02:07:10.609]  No, you're right.
[02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:12.289]  What's crazy is it's all on record.
[02:07:12.349 --> 02:07:14.869]  People think like we're saying this, it's all on record.
[02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.570]  It is.
[02:07:17.010 --> 02:07:22.371]  And even the powers that be will leave it there because they think we're too stupid, and you say that all the time, quite notably.
[02:07:23.050 --> 02:07:25.052]  And so I just want to say Nuremberg was a failure.
[02:07:25.072 --> 02:07:28.214]  So whatever happens next, they got to go down this time, Alex.
[02:07:28.694 --> 02:07:28.975]  Okay?
[02:07:29.655 --> 02:07:34.759]  And I just want to say that the unified field theory on these vaccines starts with that spike protein.
[02:07:35.299 --> 02:07:47.266]   And I wanted to say that right before this whole thing was unleashed in around 2016-2015, they were able to crack the code on signaling proteins, of which the spike protein is Okay?
[02:07:47.667 --> 02:07:58.513]  And it's very important people understand that... And within a few years of them getting it, they patent the spike protein of HIV, and they hit us with it, and they admit now that they are causing giant autoimmune disorders.
[02:07:58.533 --> 02:07:59.894]  They're giving everybody AIDS right now.
[02:08:01.307 --> 02:08:09.835]  But that's, and this could be an aspect of this, and I'll leave you with this because then we're going to move on, but that technology that they're putting in people that everybody knows, the intercorporal body network, okay?
[02:08:09.875 --> 02:08:11.737]  That the fifth column and everybody's been talking about?
[02:08:11.897 --> 02:08:12.117]  Yeah.
[02:08:12.177 --> 02:08:13.458]  Two Peters and all, right?
[02:08:13.678 --> 02:08:13.879]  Okay?
[02:08:14.179 --> 02:08:20.805]  They need to have that exist in the body, and they need to have autoimmune suppressants so that stuff can exist, right?
[02:08:21.205 --> 02:08:21.606]  In the body.
[02:08:22.188 --> 02:08:26.871]  So they can actually work between the cell signaling pathways and that autoimmune response.
[02:08:26.911 --> 02:08:30.113]  They're able to put what they need to, to get that technology up and running.
[02:08:30.273 --> 02:08:35.217]  That's why they're not so worried now, because whatever comes next, the people that took this will be susceptible, that lived.
[02:08:35.817 --> 02:08:40.901]  They've already got enough people to test on and slowly kill and rob and use as their test subjects.
[02:08:40.921 --> 02:08:42.001]  Yes, that's why they launched it.
[02:08:42.322 --> 02:08:48.125]  They even have it in the SPARS document that the world would wake up and they back off phase one.
[02:08:48.145 --> 02:08:48.866]  You're absolutely right.
[02:08:48.886 --> 02:08:49.546]  All right, thank you.
[02:08:50.887 --> 02:08:51.668]  Mike and Chris.
[02:08:52.915 --> 02:08:56.281]  We're going to come back for five more minutes, and I'll give you each two and a half minutes.
[02:08:56.301 --> 02:08:58.785]  I really look forward to talking to you, because I'm not giving you time.
[02:08:58.805 --> 02:08:59.506]  You're giving me time.
[02:08:59.566 --> 02:09:02.411]  I really look forward to you being on air, so don't thank me.
[02:09:03.293 --> 02:09:04.575]  Separately, look.
[02:09:05.413 --> 02:09:06.434]  I'm not a big globalist.
[02:09:06.494 --> 02:09:10.818]  I'm not George Soros or Bill Gates or any of these people.
[02:09:10.958 --> 02:09:15.242]  I'm just a regular guy interfacing with you and the human network to fight these folks.
[02:09:15.642 --> 02:09:17.003]  And I got great products you need.
[02:09:17.504 --> 02:09:20.907]  X3 is three types of the best iodine together for your immune system, your body.
[02:09:21.227 --> 02:09:22.628]  You should really experience this.
[02:09:23.089 --> 02:09:24.130]  And it funds the M4 Total Win.
[02:09:24.150 --> 02:09:24.510]  It is 50% off.
[02:09:28.153 --> 02:09:29.714]  And they didn't cut the sale off last week.
[02:09:29.754 --> 02:09:31.975]  I told them, hey, stop selling stuff, you know, 40% off.
[02:09:32.035 --> 02:09:33.256]  It's going to sell out.
[02:09:33.276 --> 02:09:34.096]  We don't have it for months.
[02:09:34.477 --> 02:09:35.557]  They still kept it on sale.
[02:09:35.617 --> 02:09:41.500]  Our whole food vitamin, multivitamin, and our super 1100% vitamin C rose hips, zinc tablets.
[02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:43.822]  Those are still 40% off, even though they're selling out.
[02:09:44.682 --> 02:09:48.164]  Bone broth, ultimate turmeric formula bodies are discounted.
[02:09:48.604 --> 02:09:51.486]  All these great new t-shirts, books and films, a lot of new stuff in.
[02:09:52.771 --> 02:09:58.811]   at infowarrestore.com. And all I want to do is stay on air to keep fighting these people.
[02:09:58.811 --> 02:10:02.572]   So you just don't know how close it is when you fund us to us being shut down. And I can
[02:10:02.572 --> 02:10:09.331]   tell you, we've had massive, massive effects against evil together.
[02:10:09.220 --> 02:10:10.880]  You and I and all of us, what we've done.
[02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:12.381]  So thank you for your word of mouth.
[02:10:12.781 --> 02:10:13.761]  Thank you for your prayers.
[02:10:13.881 --> 02:10:17.042]  And thank you for buying products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:10:17.823 --> 02:10:23.825]  And I'm not trying to be dramatic, but any week or month or, you know, now as crazy as it is, it could be the end of InfoWars.
[02:10:23.845 --> 02:10:26.286]  But we're going to send transmissions out to the very end.
[02:10:26.566 --> 02:10:30.307]  And every day what we do is more important and bigger because what we warned of is happening.
[02:10:30.727 --> 02:10:31.848]  So God is in charge.
[02:10:31.948 --> 02:10:32.868]  Satan is not in charge.
[02:10:34.295 --> 02:10:37.518]  But God works through you to fund the info war, so please take action.
[02:10:38.179 --> 02:10:40.281]  And 25% off of storable foods till Monday.
[02:10:40.601 --> 02:10:41.562]  Biggest sale in four years.
[02:10:43.283 --> 02:10:44.204]  And we are back.
[02:10:44.284 --> 02:10:48.408]  Final segment before Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:10:48.428 --> 02:10:49.869]  20 plus year info warrior.
[02:10:51.451 --> 02:10:53.553]  Original OG takes over.
[02:10:54.193 --> 02:10:55.875]  Let's talk to Chris in Atlanta.
[02:10:56.435 --> 02:10:57.416]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:10:57.757 --> 02:10:58.998]  What's your take on what's happening?
[02:11:00.051 --> 02:11:01.552]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:11:01.812 --> 02:11:03.694]  There's two things that I wanted to mention to you.
[02:11:04.334 --> 02:11:07.697]  First, I wanted to mention an Indeed ad.
[02:11:08.157 --> 02:11:10.639]  In case you don't know, it's a job listing website.
[02:11:11.139 --> 02:11:17.404]  Anyway, there's an ad out there looking for role players in DC and it's pretty interesting actually.
[02:11:17.444 --> 02:11:29.193]  It says that it's a company called CA&M Incorporated and basically they're looking for role players to enact training events such as health disaster training, law enforcement training, etc.
[02:11:30.256 --> 02:11:33.859]  But the requirements, um, it's pretty interesting.
[02:11:33.979 --> 02:11:39.604]  Also, at the very end it says they want role players with secret security clearance, retired DOD Department of State.
[02:11:40.364 --> 02:11:45.048]  And I sent this link to your, uh, News Tips as well, uh, the News Tips link.
[02:11:45.488 --> 02:11:56.797]  Well, thanks for calling about that, but CNN and the Democrat lawyers say role players don't exist even though they hired people for Charlottesville and hired people for January 6th.
[02:11:56.858 --> 02:11:58.379]  And if you talk about it, you get sued.
[02:11:58.859 --> 02:12:02.216]   So I just want to say, The State Department's wrong.
[02:12:02.636 --> 02:12:04.077]  Russia couldn't stage a false flag.
[02:12:04.518 --> 02:12:05.599]  False flags don't exist.
[02:12:05.619 --> 02:12:07.760]  Gulf of Tonkin was a stage, even though they admit it was.
[02:12:08.241 --> 02:12:10.803]  Northwoods wasn't a real plan, even though they admit it's real.
[02:12:11.764 --> 02:12:13.405]  Jesse Smollett was really attacked.
[02:12:13.745 --> 02:12:15.126]  Bubba Wallace did have nooses.
[02:12:15.547 --> 02:12:17.188]  There were WMDs in Iraq.
[02:12:17.228 --> 02:12:18.629]  There were babies in incubators in 1990.
[02:12:20.010 --> 02:12:25.471]  Uh, and I don't want to get sued, so, uh, I don't care if there's ads for crisis actors in D.C.
[02:12:25.851 --> 02:12:27.312]  It doesn't exist.
[02:12:27.352 --> 02:12:27.812]  You understand?
[02:12:28.092 --> 02:12:33.153]  The Democrats said, so say with me, do not question official stories.
[02:12:33.393 --> 02:12:34.293]  Just say it with me, Chris.
[02:12:34.973 --> 02:12:35.693]  Okay, gotcha.
[02:12:35.733 --> 02:12:36.893]  Let's say it.
[02:12:36.913 --> 02:12:38.414]  Do not question an official story.
[02:12:38.974 --> 02:12:46.159]   No, but very interesting, Chris, that you've engaged in a hateful white supremacist thing to talk about how Let's be serious.
[02:12:46.239 --> 02:12:59.189]  I went to UN events like 15 years ago where they would have people on bullhorns with Hollywood directors and buses pulling up of actors being paid $100 a day back then, like $200 a day now, to literally go, we want to ban meat!
[02:12:59.249 --> 02:13:00.170]  We want to ban meat!
[02:13:00.190 --> 02:13:02.012]  And they would hand them the signs.
[02:13:02.532 --> 02:13:06.696]  So yes, so much of this is staged and they don't want us questioning that.
[02:13:06.996 --> 02:13:08.057]  That's why they're so pissed.
[02:13:08.357 --> 02:13:09.819]  So great job pointing this out.
[02:13:10.099 --> 02:13:15.564]  Tell us what you discovered in this job posting for crisis actors in DC with security clearances.
[02:13:15.584 --> 02:13:17.626]  Because obviously the agency doesn't do it.
[02:13:18.006 --> 02:13:21.629]  A manager group hires their own people so there's plausible deniability.
[02:13:22.010 --> 02:13:26.614]  Then they have their group go out and post their little right-wing rage.
[02:13:27.717 --> 02:13:30.860]  Well, I found that it was posted by a company called C.A.N.M.
[02:13:30.900 --> 02:13:32.721]  Incorporated, and I looked it up.
[02:13:32.781 --> 02:13:35.663]  It's a small company based out of Maryland.
[02:13:35.964 --> 02:13:37.325]  It says it's a stock company.
[02:13:38.866 --> 02:13:51.776]  But, yeah, so I looked that up, and then in the description, it says that candidates should be comfortable on schedule, you know, being scheduled on short notice for ACONUS events, which ACONUS stands for Outside the Continental U.S.
[02:13:52.316 --> 02:14:02.325]   But they also call for people to realistically, accurately, and convincingly portray a role You know, be able to take directions and, you know, talk to the media.
[02:14:02.365 --> 02:14:04.748]  Let me just, I know you know this, obviously, as someone who's a smart person.
[02:14:05.148 --> 02:14:14.316]  This is how agencies create a corporation as a cutout, so they have deniability about whatever it is, and then they're like, oh, you gotta have top-secret security clearances to be part of this.
[02:14:14.656 --> 02:14:17.539]  Their own people are ordered to show up and enroll in this.
[02:14:17.599 --> 02:14:18.680]  It's a very thin veil.
[02:14:19.881 --> 02:14:21.002]  Yeah, I just thought it's interesting.
[02:14:21.062 --> 02:14:24.365]  It was posted five days ago, you know, so something happened, you know.
[02:14:25.256 --> 02:14:25.576]  Might be.
[02:14:26.156 --> 02:14:27.517]  Oh, I mean, wait a minute.
[02:14:28.257 --> 02:14:31.159]  CNN said crisis actors don't exist.
[02:14:31.179 --> 02:14:33.560]  So why are you engaging in hateful behavior, sir?
[02:14:35.020 --> 02:14:35.581]  My mistake.
[02:14:35.661 --> 02:14:36.081]  I'm sorry.
[02:14:36.961 --> 02:14:38.482]  Well, we'll get a story about this.
[02:14:40.023 --> 02:14:50.067]  You know, they really mad at us to talk about their staged events, so I'm sure whatever they're planning with people with security clearances and top level security clearances is totally normal.
[02:14:50.367 --> 02:14:51.428]  Don't you think so, Chris?
[02:14:52.588 --> 02:14:53.609]  It's definitely normal.
[02:14:54.308 --> 02:14:59.792]  The second thing I wanted to mention to you as well, I have an idea to get around big tech censorship.
[02:15:00.852 --> 02:15:06.255]  I was really involved in Ron Paul's 2008 campaign as far as like, just DIY, getting the word out.
[02:15:06.916 --> 02:15:15.821]  And I think it might be, you know, effective to take a DIY approach, like hang banners, you know, made of sheet... Hold on, Paul Watson's taking over, but I want to hear what you have to say.
[02:15:15.881 --> 02:15:17.522]  So Chris and Mike are the last callers.
[02:15:17.622 --> 02:15:20.264]  I promise you guys don't forget, because you always do.
[02:15:20.284 --> 02:15:21.605]  The crew does a great job, but they forget about this.
[02:15:22.242 --> 02:15:24.264]  I'm going to call you back at the start of the show to Chris tomorrow.
[02:15:24.284 --> 02:15:25.064]  Can you come on at like 11.30?
[02:15:25.104 --> 02:15:27.046]  Sounds good to me.
[02:15:27.346 --> 02:15:28.487]  Call Chris at 11.30.
[02:15:28.527 --> 02:15:29.768]  He's our guest and Mike.
[02:15:30.488 --> 02:15:32.110]  Mike and Chris, 11.30 tomorrow.
[02:15:32.250 --> 02:15:37.250]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over from Summit.News in 60.

[02:16:43.473 --> 02:16:48.075]  We are live, it is the Summit News Hour on this Thursday edition.
[02:16:48.115 --> 02:16:56.519]  Got a ton, an avalanche of news to cover as per usual, related to what is being signalled as the end of the Covid-19 pandemic.
[02:16:56.839 --> 02:16:57.859]  Oh no, don't say that!
[02:16:58.499 --> 02:17:05.783]  Some people are desperate to cling on to their grift, which they've desperately clung on to for the past 24 months.
[02:17:06.263 --> 02:17:11.085]  But it appears as though, at least in Europe, Fauci's obviously remiss to accept that it's happening.
[02:17:11.616 --> 02:17:13.758]  But it does appear to be coming to an end.
[02:17:14.639 --> 02:17:28.431]  And every week I come on here and say, there's a bombshell news story that nobody is covering, it's not got anywhere near the level of coverage it deserves in the legacy media, and for good reason, and yet, again, we have another story.
[02:17:28.951 --> 02:17:37.439]  In that context today, headline, doctor who discovered Omicron variant says she was pressured to not reveal it was mild.
[02:17:38.456 --> 02:18:10.159]   Now, if you were listening to me back in mid-December, you'll remember that I was warning people until I was blue in the face that there was no need for extra lockdown mask rule restrictions to fight Omicron because all the data coming out of South Africa, which was first hit by the Omicron variant, which by the way had a vaccinated, the esteemed vaunted COVID-19 vaccination, had only got to 25% of the South African population at that time, And yet the Omicron variant in South Africa was mild.
[02:18:10.179 --> 02:18:12.000]  It wasn't causing serious illness.
[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:14.823]  It wasn't causing a rise in death.
[02:18:15.843 --> 02:18:20.227]  There was one doctor who was at the forefront of pushing the same message.
[02:18:20.948 --> 02:18:40.788]   The very discoverer of the Omicron variant itself, Dr. Angelique Courtsy in South Africa, Who went on BBC News, Sky News, CNN, all these other networks, and tried to tell people that Europe was freaking out, panicking, overreacting, same with America, in introducing new restrictions.
[02:18:40.868 --> 02:18:42.889]  By the way, some of which are still in place.
[02:18:43.910 --> 02:18:46.091]  In Scotland, you still have to wear a mask everywhere.
[02:18:46.671 --> 02:18:55.136]  In Spain, up until yesterday, they were still making people wear masks outside anywhere they walked around in Spain.
[02:18:56.128 --> 02:19:03.910]  I was in Spain in 2020 when the first wave of coronavirus had completely dipped and they were still making people wear masks outside then.
[02:19:04.250 --> 02:19:11.112]  I saw people hiking up mountains wearing frigging face masks at risk to their own health and safety.
[02:19:11.872 --> 02:19:23.393]   Well now the South African doctor who first discovered the Omicron variant says she was pressured by European governments to not reveal that it was mild They told her to shut up.
[02:19:23.794 --> 02:19:26.919]  Why is this not the biggest story in the media today?
[02:19:27.039 --> 02:19:27.600]  It should be.
[02:19:28.301 --> 02:19:32.808]  She made the bombshell revelation during an interview with Germany's Welt newspaper.
[02:19:33.550 --> 02:19:38.706]   She said, quote, I was told not to state publicly that it was a mild illness.
[02:19:38.806 --> 02:19:44.331]  I have been asked to refrain from making such statements to say and to say that it is a serious illness.
[02:19:44.992 --> 02:19:47.194]  I declined, she said.
[02:19:47.594 --> 02:19:58.360]   So even though she was being pressured and in this article she names Scientific experts in the Netherlands, in the UK, who were telling her, don't say that!
[02:19:58.620 --> 02:20:05.806]  Don't give people the good news that it's nature's vaccine, that it's mild and it's not going to cause a serious uptick in Covid-19 hospitalizations.
[02:20:06.447 --> 02:20:08.449]  We want the justification.
[02:20:08.509 --> 02:20:19.939]  We want to grease the skids, to reimpose mask mandates, to reimpose... Okay, she could only be talking about the sage people.
[02:20:20.788 --> 02:20:48.726]   Who before the Omicron variant emerged in the UK said that if Prime Minister Boris Johnson didn't impose strict lockdown measures, lockdown measures that by the way have completely not only devastated the economy but led to a multi-million increase in NHS waiting list patients, Up to 740,000 people missed cancer screenings because of these draconian, onerous lockdown policies, which have proven completely wrong.
[02:20:49.286 --> 02:20:54.268]  Even Johns Hopkins has come out and said that this was wrong to impose these measures.
[02:20:54.448 --> 02:20:56.548]  It caused massive damage.
[02:20:57.469 --> 02:21:01.370]  All these countries now have to take the L and accept that they were wrong.
[02:21:02.020 --> 02:21:09.403]  But when she was saying that, she was being told to shut up by technocrats in the United Kingdom and in these other European countries.
[02:21:09.443 --> 02:21:11.504]  This is an absolute scandal.
[02:21:12.464 --> 02:21:38.797]   And again, this needs to be part of an investigation going forward, where the people who deliberately misled the public by over-exaggerating the risk posed by Covid-19, causing devastating knock-on effects, not just for people missing cancer screenings, people missing treatment of serious illnesses and going on to die, But of course the whole mask rule theatre which expanded its tentacles into schools of course, that's still taking place in America.
[02:21:38.817 --> 02:21:42.779]  Now there are multiple examples of a 364% increase according to one speech therapist.
[02:21:47.162 --> 02:21:53.805]  Incognitive development disorders in children because of the making kids wear masks.
[02:21:54.246 --> 02:22:06.371]  That needs to be part of a criminal investigation and the scientists, the esteemed experts who knowingly pushed medical misinformation which led to this catastrophe, need to be put in prison.
[02:22:07.432 --> 02:22:09.173]  And this story needs to get out there.
[02:22:10.313 --> 02:22:15.516]  She abided by the WHO's definition of COVID-19 as a mild disease.
[02:22:16.590 --> 02:22:21.414]  She said, quote, a serious illness is one in which we see acute pulmonary respiratory infections.
[02:22:21.454 --> 02:22:24.396]  People need oxygen, maybe even artificial respiration.
[02:22:24.957 --> 02:22:27.919]  We saw that with Delta, but not with Omicron.
[02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:32.863]  This is from the doctor in South Africa who first discovered Omicron.
[02:22:33.304 --> 02:22:38.288]  So I said to people, quote, I can't say it like that because it's not what we're seeing.
[02:22:38.728 --> 02:22:52.920]   She was told To tell people, to tell the world, in Europe, in America, that Omicron was going to cause serious illness, a massive rise in hospitalizations, to give the technocrats the justification to lock down further.
[02:22:53.846 --> 02:22:57.949]  And again, I go back to this poll, KeckCNC, back in August 2020.
[02:22:58.829 --> 02:23:04.233]  They asked the average American how many people in America they thought had died from coronavirus in summer 2020.
[02:23:04.873 --> 02:23:16.361]  The average American thought 30 million people in America alone had died of coronavirus purely because of the hysteria-driven mental reaction.
[02:23:17.190 --> 02:23:22.793]  The complete overreaction to the fatality rate, the threat posed by COVID in the first place.
[02:23:22.833 --> 02:23:25.975]  So these technocrats in Europe wanted her to continue that hysteria.
[02:23:26.515 --> 02:23:28.056]  She said no.
[02:23:28.797 --> 02:23:36.401]  The doctor was asked why health authorities tried to prevent her from telling the truth, to which she responded, they tried, but they didn't make it.
[02:23:37.426 --> 02:23:45.191]  She goes on to say, quote, what I said at one point because I was just tired of it, was in South Africa this is a mild illness but in Europe it's a very serious one.
[02:23:45.632 --> 02:23:57.079]  So she had to completely contradict what she was seeing on the ground in South Africa to placate these technocrats who wanted to maintain that level of fear-mongering.
[02:23:57.179 --> 02:24:06.766]  But in general she didn't follow the dictate and she went on BBC CNN and said, it's a mild illness, this is not going to cause a massive uptick in hospitalisations.
[02:24:07.222 --> 02:24:08.563]  What the hell are you doing?
[02:24:08.723 --> 02:24:10.064]  Why are you overreacting?
[02:24:11.145 --> 02:24:30.739]  In the UK, SAGE government advisors, who she says pressured her, literally predicted, and I made multiple videos about this in mid-December and was proven completely correct, they said Omicron in the UK would cause 6,000 COVID deaths a day if harsher restrictions weren't imposed.
[02:24:31.319 --> 02:24:32.000]  Well, guess what?
[02:24:32.060 --> 02:24:50.432]   Those harsher restrictions weren't imposed, the one thing that Boris Johnson got right, And now ONS official government data for January in the UK shows that actual deaths are around 93% lower than the SAGE forecast if Boris did not introduce more restrictions.
[02:24:50.893 --> 02:24:53.554]  They got it wrong just as they got it wrong back in July.
[02:24:54.389 --> 02:25:06.660]  In England, when they said if you lift the mask mandates, if you lift the lockdown restrictions on July 19th, Freedom Day, we're going to see 4,000 hospitalisations a day, it never got anywhere near that.
[02:25:06.700 --> 02:25:10.483]  They were proven wrong as they've been proven wrong time and time again.
[02:25:11.564 --> 02:25:21.313]  Absolutely bombshell story, should have been covered in legacy media, has basically just come out in a few places and tomorrow it will be completely forgotten.
[02:25:22.068 --> 02:25:24.410]  Meanwhile, Sweden declares the pandemic to be over.
[02:25:25.470 --> 02:25:33.176]  This is from their Minister of Health, Lina Hallengren, who said it's not over, but as we know it in terms of quick changes and restrictions, it is.
[02:25:34.207 --> 02:25:41.051]  Reuters reported the comments were close as possible to the country, quote, effectively declaring the pandemic is over.
[02:25:41.491 --> 02:25:45.113]  Bear in mind, Sweden never imposed harsh restrictions.
[02:25:45.173 --> 02:25:48.155]  They never imposed harsh mandatory mask rules.
[02:25:48.655 --> 02:26:03.284]  And compared to basket case zero COVID countries like Australia and New Zealand, they're now exiting the pandemic, lifting all the restrictions while Australia, New Zealand and all these basket case countries keep them in place.
[02:26:03.704 --> 02:26:04.424]  She was right.
[02:26:04.464 --> 02:26:05.225]  Sweden was right.
[02:26:05.425 --> 02:26:05.905]  They were wrong.
[02:26:06.085 --> 02:26:08.486]  They need to take the L. Summit.News, we'll be back.
[02:26:09.186 --> 02:26:13.228]  Well, the esteemed fact-checkers have raised their ugly heads once again.
[02:26:13.288 --> 02:26:20.171]  The Ministry of Truth, whose job is to not reveal the truth, but to bury and censor information.
[02:26:20.631 --> 02:26:29.695]  Today, in regards to the much-vaunted, safe and effective coronavirus vaccine, they've done a fact-check headline.
[02:26:30.916 --> 02:26:31.376]  AP.
[02:26:31.896 --> 02:26:36.657]  Experts say changes to CDC's vaccination definition are normal.
[02:26:36.998 --> 02:26:38.458]  Move along, nothing to see here!
[02:26:39.118 --> 02:26:51.461]  So they fact-checked the claim that from 2015 to 2021 the CDC said, quote, the act of introducing a vaccine into the body to produce immunity to a specific disease.
[02:26:51.881 --> 02:26:54.742]  That was the CDC's definition of a vaccine from 2015 to 2021.
[02:26:54.802 --> 02:27:01.424]   They fact-checked The claim that that has been changed now.
[02:27:01.924 --> 02:27:07.166]  Even though it has been changed, it's completely accurate to say that the CDC has changed it.
[02:27:08.007 --> 02:27:16.190]  It says, claim the Census for Disease Control and Prevention has changed its definition of vaccination because COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective.
[02:27:17.171 --> 02:27:24.114]  Now, they have changed the definition, but the AP fact checkers, the Ministry of Truth, says that that's missing context.
[02:27:24.514 --> 02:27:34.537]   The CDC has altered the language We were always at war with East Asia in the definition of vaccination on its website, including after the development of COVID-19 vaccines.
[02:27:35.378 --> 02:27:47.508]  So before this one vaccine, the CDC said the definition of a vaccine was the act of introducing a vaccine into the body to produce immunity to a specific disease.
[02:27:48.028 --> 02:28:00.015]   The fact that the COVID-19 vaccine doesn't provide immunity and therefore isn't widely effective, That's been fact-checked, even though that's a completely accurate statement to make.
[02:28:01.216 --> 02:28:02.317]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:28:02.837 --> 02:28:04.879]  Case in point, Prince Charles.
[02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:15.687]  Triple vaxxed, boosted, vehement proponent of wearing masks, today tested Covid positive for the second time because vaccines are effective.
[02:28:16.087 --> 02:28:22.611]   No, they're not effective, at least this one hasn't been effective, In stopping immunity.
[02:28:22.931 --> 02:28:23.851]  That is a fact.
[02:28:23.891 --> 02:28:30.193]  You can't fact check a verifiable, manifestly provable truth, even though they're attempting to do that.
[02:28:30.753 --> 02:28:43.997]  So they did change the definition of vaccine because the COVID-19 vaccine wasn't effective at producing, in their own words, before 2022, quote, immunity to a specific disease.
[02:28:44.497 --> 02:28:50.401]   So once again, the fact checkers have Come out and said, oh, no, that's been debunked, even though it hasn't been debunked.
[02:28:50.461 --> 02:29:00.949]  And it's literally true, proven once again today by Prince Charles being double vaccinated and boosted and catching COVID for the second frigging time.
[02:29:01.490 --> 02:29:16.001]  On the subject of the Ministry of Truth and Fact Checkers, let's go to this video now, because we had a story a few days ago about the Biden administration funding crack pipes for drug addicts because it's proven so effective in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
[02:29:16.716 --> 02:29:19.777]  Stokes came out and said it was, quote, mostly false.
[02:29:20.398 --> 02:29:23.579]  Even though it wasn't false, it was completely true.
[02:29:23.999 --> 02:29:25.880]  Once again, let's go to this video.
[02:29:26.300 --> 02:29:29.102]  The fact-checkers or the Ministry of Truth.
[02:29:29.182 --> 02:29:29.582]  Here it is.
[02:29:30.482 --> 02:29:30.802]  Wow!
[02:29:30.902 --> 02:29:34.064]  Turns out fact-checkers aren't neutral bastions of impartiality.
[02:29:34.124 --> 02:29:37.305]  After all, they're just corrupt mouthpieces for the establishment.
[02:29:37.325 --> 02:29:40.927]  Fact-checkers say narrative that contradicts regime isn't happening.
[02:29:41.087 --> 02:29:42.468]  Yet another case in point.
[02:29:42.508 --> 02:29:57.875]  The Washington Free Beacon reported that as part of a $30 million grant program, the Biden administration is planning to give out free crack pipes to drug addicts in quote, undeserved communities, in the name of quote, advancing racial equity.
[02:29:57.995 --> 02:30:07.000]  Because it worked out so well in San Francisco, Snopes then conducted a fact check of this report and concluded that it was, quote, mostly false.
[02:30:07.221 --> 02:30:12.904]  Not because the Biden administration isn't planning to give out free crack pipes to homeless drug addicts.
[02:30:13.484 --> 02:30:13.965]  They are.
[02:30:14.125 --> 02:30:22.670]  But because, quote, this was just one of around 20 components of the grant program and far from its most prominent or important one.
[02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:33.819]  So they are giving out crackpipes to drug addicts, but because that's only one of twenty components of the grant, the claim that they're giving out crackpipes to drug addicts is quote mostly false.
[02:30:33.980 --> 02:30:34.300]  What?
[02:30:34.580 --> 02:30:35.241]  No it isn't.
[02:30:35.321 --> 02:30:39.084]  They are funding crackpipes for drug addicts, that's completely true.
[02:30:39.144 --> 02:30:44.809]  You admit it in your own article, but then claim in the same article that it's mostly false.
[02:30:45.089 --> 02:30:49.092]  Oh now the esteemed Snopes has said it's false, then it must be false.
[02:30:49.993 --> 02:30:51.534]  Even though it's literally not false.
[02:30:51.755 --> 02:30:58.120]  So they've turned something into fake news, contributing to the story being buried by social media algorithms.
[02:30:58.180 --> 02:31:01.382]  When it's not fake news at all, it's actually happening.
[02:31:01.582 --> 02:31:07.727]  Don't forget that Snopes is used by Facebook and others as a neutral, independent fact checker.
[02:31:07.767 --> 02:31:13.552]  Their supposed impartiality is used to bury stories deemed as misinformation.
[02:31:13.712 --> 02:31:16.375]  And yet Snopes has got it wrong time and time again.
[02:31:16.475 --> 02:31:27.446]  Like when they said it was mostly false that a 1981 Dean Kuntz novel predicted coronavirus, despite the story centering around a virus released from a lab called Wuhan 400.
[02:31:27.627 --> 02:31:32.852]  Snopes was also an early adopter of the notion that the lab leak theory was a debunked conspiracy theory.
[02:31:32.972 --> 02:31:40.215]  A narrative circulated by the very same people working in concert with the Wuhan lab to cover their own behind.
[02:31:40.375 --> 02:31:48.859]  Snopes routinely fact checks the Babylon Bee, a satirical publication, again in an effort to bury it in social media algorithms.
[02:31:48.959 --> 02:31:54.384]  They also fact-check memes that blatantly not intended to be a portrayal of reality.
[02:31:54.484 --> 02:31:57.486]  Like this one showing AOC on the Price is Right.
[02:31:57.526 --> 02:32:03.992]  Snopes falsely claimed it was unproven that American Indian activist Nathan Phillips falsely claimed to be a Vietnam veteran.
[02:32:04.052 --> 02:32:06.514]  He did falsely claim to be a Vietnam veteran!
[02:32:06.554 --> 02:32:12.980]  Snopes hires, quote, impartial fact-checkers who have a history of working with far-left news and opinion outlets.
[02:32:13.220 --> 02:32:17.323]  Snopes routinely runs cover for Democrats caught in embarrassing situations.
[02:32:17.443 --> 02:32:31.852]  When these entities with a consistent track record of hyper-partisanship, dishonesty and outright lying are being handed the power to decide what's misinformation and what's credible, that's not fact-checking, that's cronyism.
[02:32:32.172 --> 02:32:34.834]  It's agenda-driven censorship.
[02:32:37.717 --> 02:32:38.298]  There you have it.
[02:32:38.338 --> 02:32:52.600]  Now I've made the point many times that the unvaccinated in today's society represent the most demonised, monstered and discriminated against minority group that we've seen for generations and we have another example of that today.
[02:32:53.261 --> 02:32:57.663]  James Carville says he wants to punch the unvaccinated in the face.
[02:32:58.224 --> 02:33:31.531]   This is Democratic strategist James Carville, who during the Politics War Room podcast, said in response to a caller who asked why Biden didn't pass a law banning the unjab from interstate travel, that's right, they think you shouldn't be able to drive your car across state lines because you've chosen not to take a medical procedure, He said, quote, I wish what they do is pass a law to make you immune from liability if you punch some unvaccinated person right in the face, which I'd really like to do, said Carville, so much for the tolerant left.
[02:33:32.452 --> 02:33:37.395]  He went on to say, if you ask me what's my first reaction to you if you're not vaccinated, you don't have any medical reason not to be.
[02:33:37.815 --> 02:33:39.456]  You're a piece of SHIT, okay?
[02:33:39.576 --> 02:33:40.637]  I just want to punch you in the face.
[02:33:41.537 --> 02:33:41.738]  Again.
[02:33:41.758 --> 02:33:44.940]  This guy's 77 years old.
[02:33:45.080 --> 02:33:59.714]   I know there's old man strength, but I think Some unvaccinated Americans should challenge the 77-year-old James Carville to a boxing match where he can punch them in the face and they can punch him back.
[02:34:00.694 --> 02:34:08.219]  The host, his co-host, went on to agree with violently attacking people who choose not to undergo a medical procedure, because that's progressive!
[02:34:09.269 --> 02:34:15.594]  The two hosts lamented how Biden couldn't ban the unvaccinated from interstate travel because the Supreme Court would knock it down.
[02:34:15.914 --> 02:34:21.598]  Yeah, because it's wildly unconstitutional and a disgrace to the very notion of American liberty.
[02:34:21.938 --> 02:34:24.180]  There's also a New York Times headline out today.
[02:34:24.821 --> 02:34:26.582]  An anti-vaxxer dies of COVID.
[02:34:26.922 --> 02:34:27.863]  Do you empathize?
[02:34:27.963 --> 02:34:33.147]  Remember, these are the stop bullying and harassment, be kind people.
[02:34:33.447 --> 02:34:37.850]  But if you disagree with them, if you don't take a voluntary medical procedure, they want to punch you in the face.
[02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:38.631]  They're nice people.
[02:34:39.355 --> 02:34:39.915]  We are live.
[02:34:39.955 --> 02:34:49.500]  Let's talk about cancel culture, which according to the left, like critical race theory, doesn't exist, even though it's actionable, it's happening, it's manifestly provable every single day.
[02:34:49.520 --> 02:35:06.816]   I made the point on Twitter yesterday, the amount of friends I've got who are not even political, who when they're applying for a new job, a mortgage, a loan, for whatever, You see them lock down their accounts, in some cases you see them wipe their social media accounts altogether.
[02:35:07.056 --> 02:35:11.817]  They're not even political people, they're not public figures, they're not tweeting anything that spicy.
[02:35:12.698 --> 02:35:22.321]  But again, that's the point about cancel culture, it's primary victims aren't celebrities, aren't privileged people with huge platforms, they're ordinary people.
[02:35:22.881 --> 02:35:33.403]   Like the guy in Hull a year ago, who won his case in the High Court by the way, Who had the police interrogate him for hours, call up his workplace.
[02:35:33.443 --> 02:35:36.386]  He lost his job because he didn't even say anything.
[02:35:36.626 --> 02:35:40.651]  He retweeted a limerick that made fun of transgender people.
[02:35:41.151 --> 02:35:47.138]  In the UK, thousands of people are arrested every single year for offensive tweets.
[02:35:47.935 --> 02:35:55.882]  Cancel culture is real and it affects and impacts and devastates the lives and livelihoods of ordinary working people.
[02:35:56.322 --> 02:36:14.959]  Now there was another cancel culture free speech controversy in the UK during the weekend where a comedian put out a Netflix show similar to the Dave Chappelle scandal in the United States which came to absolutely nothing even though all those freaks with pink hair walked out on their job.
[02:36:15.859 --> 02:36:38.363]   Where a comedian told a joke, an edgy holocaust joke, and now they're not only demanding that he be deplatformed and that the government seize control, regulatory control of Netflix, But one politician literally called for the people in the audience at that comedy gig to be arrested for laughing at an offensive joke.
[02:36:38.863 --> 02:36:43.708]  This is the slippery slope turned into a 200 foot high water slide.
[02:36:44.129 --> 02:36:46.471]  Arrest people who laugh at offensive jokes.
[02:36:46.591 --> 02:36:47.572]  Here's the video.
[02:36:47.672 --> 02:36:48.213]  Let's roll it.
[02:36:49.192 --> 02:36:49.652]  Broke.
[02:36:50.033 --> 02:36:52.254]  If you don't want to be offended, don't watch it.
[02:36:52.374 --> 02:36:52.734]  Woke.
[02:36:53.094 --> 02:36:55.316]  Cancel comedians who tell offensive jokes.
[02:36:55.496 --> 02:36:56.196]  Bespoke.
[02:36:56.637 --> 02:36:58.938]  Arrest people who laugh at offensive jokes.
[02:36:59.218 --> 02:37:00.799]  And that's not even a meme.
[02:37:00.919 --> 02:37:06.423]  An SNP councillor has literally called for people who find offensive jokes funny.
[02:37:06.923 --> 02:37:08.264]  To be prosecuted!
[02:37:08.304 --> 02:37:12.565]  Well, that slippery slope turned into a 200 foot high water slide in a hurry, didn't it?
[02:37:12.625 --> 02:37:14.066]  What was this in response to?
[02:37:14.246 --> 02:37:18.607]  Comedian Jimmy Carr telling a spicy gag about gypsies and the Holocaust.
[02:37:18.748 --> 02:37:25.130]  The entirely predictable, brain-dead response to all this was as if Jimmy Carr had carried out the Holocaust!
[02:37:25.490 --> 02:37:27.451]  Not simply told a joke about it.
[02:37:27.471 --> 02:37:34.453]  Jimmy Carr's joke that a positive of the Holocaust was the slaughter of 500,000 Gypsy, Roma and Sinisi people is disgusting beyond words!
[02:37:34.754 --> 02:37:37.675]  Fucking racist genocide has no place in comedy or a decent society!
[02:37:37.915 --> 02:37:40.036]  I call on Netflix to remove this grotesque material!
[02:37:40.116 --> 02:37:47.658]  Jimmy Carr's joke, like all Holocaust jokes, is completely dependent on the acceptance that the Holocaust was a horrendous atrocity.
[02:37:47.719 --> 02:37:49.879]  That's what makes the joke work!
[02:37:50.039 --> 02:38:00.364]   What also makes jokes in general what they are, jokes, Is the fact that the comedian telling them isn't being serious, he's telling a frigging joke!
[02:38:00.444 --> 02:38:01.104]  And you know what?
[02:38:01.384 --> 02:38:06.646]  If you don't agree with any of that, and you're still offended, you know what option is left open to you?
[02:38:06.746 --> 02:38:08.447]  Don't fucking watch it!
[02:38:08.627 --> 02:38:18.071]  Oh great, another opportunity for some middle class metropolitan pants pisser to score a dopamine hit on Twitter by proving once again what a good person they are!
[02:38:18.291 --> 02:38:19.992]  I'm offended on their behalf.
[02:38:20.213 --> 02:38:21.253]  Oh, piss off!
[02:38:21.393 --> 02:38:27.078]  Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said Carr's comments were, quote, abhorrent and they just shouldn't be on television.
[02:38:27.118 --> 02:38:28.699]  But they weren't comments.
[02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:30.801]  Carr wasn't endorsing genocide.
[02:38:31.301 --> 02:38:32.022]  It was a joke!
[02:38:32.142 --> 02:38:39.388]  She then seized upon the controversy to grease the skids for yet more laws restricting, you guessed it, free speech.
[02:38:39.468 --> 02:38:47.614]   Nadine Dorries, of course, being the same woman who in 2017 complained of, quote, Left-wing snowflakes killing comedy.
[02:38:47.654 --> 02:38:49.034]  It's okay when we do it.
[02:38:49.114 --> 02:38:56.359]  Of course, when Jimmy Carr vilified another minority group in the same show, The Unvaccinated, he was applauded.
[02:38:56.419 --> 02:38:59.440]  But the establishment says they're bad people.
[02:38:59.581 --> 02:39:03.923]  So punching down against that minority group is perfectly permissible.
[02:39:04.043 --> 02:39:10.267]  Now, the head of Ofcom is exploiting the hysteria in an attempt to expand its censorship tentacles to cover Netflix.
[02:39:10.347 --> 02:39:14.049]  And as per usual, the timing here is a little more than coincidental.
[02:39:14.209 --> 02:39:26.097]  Not only are they trying to create an environment to ram through this media bill to control Netflix and any similar platform that comes after Netflix, they're also pushing an onerous online safety bill.
[02:39:26.137 --> 02:39:31.981]  They would outlaw speech that causes, quote, emotional harm to a perceived victim.
[02:39:32.081 --> 02:39:35.323]  Another vague catch-all term completely open to abuse.
[02:39:35.443 --> 02:39:45.469]   Given that enunciating biological facts about sex and gender is now considered hateful as ever, we see the same cycle repeated Over and over again.
[02:39:45.429 --> 02:39:52.088]   Feign outrage, milk it for power and control. Feign outrage, milk it for power and control. Feign outrage, milk it for
[02:39:52.088 --> 02:39:53.168]  power and control.
[02:39:53.168 --> 02:39:54.488]  Strange that, isn't it?
[02:39:54.531 --> 02:40:02.032]  The solution to people being offended is always to hand over more power and control to those who claim they were offended.
[02:40:02.052 --> 02:40:07.193]  The feigned outrage is merely a useful conduit for what they wanted all along.
[02:40:07.613 --> 02:40:09.333]  Power and control.
[02:40:12.454 --> 02:40:28.019]   Speaking of Power and Control, in a completely smooth segue, DHS issues terrorism bulletin over jihadist radicals, over violent Antifa left-wing extremists, over BLM murderers.
[02:40:28.079 --> 02:40:28.279]  No.
[02:40:29.060 --> 02:40:34.965]  They issued a terrorism bulletin over, quote, conspiracy theories and misleading narratives.
[02:40:35.005 --> 02:40:35.265]  Yeah.
[02:40:36.006 --> 02:40:37.487]  Not trusting CNN.
[02:40:37.527 --> 02:40:40.790]  That might be a terrorist threat, according to the DHS.
[02:40:41.550 --> 02:40:47.160]  Which has issued a new terrorism bulletin in response to concerns over conspiracy theories and misleading narratives.
[02:40:48.022 --> 02:40:48.182]  Oh.
[02:40:48.382 --> 02:40:48.663]  My.
[02:40:48.823 --> 02:40:49.204]  God.
[02:40:49.224 --> 02:40:50.266]  The absolute horror!
[02:40:51.457 --> 02:40:53.438]  This is literally from the DHS.
[02:40:53.558 --> 02:40:55.198]  This is who they're protecting you from.
[02:40:55.758 --> 02:41:03.281]  The United States remains in a heightened threat environment fueled by several factors, including people posting things on Twitter that offend others.
[02:41:03.861 --> 02:41:04.801]  No, that's not a quote.
[02:41:04.821 --> 02:41:16.185]  The quote is including an online environment filled with false or misleading narratives, like saying that the coronavirus vaccine doesn't stop the spread of coronavirus, even though it literally doesn't.
[02:41:17.409 --> 02:41:30.292]  Filled with false or misleading narratives and conspiracy theories and other forms of mis, dis and mal-information, MDM, sounds like some kind of drug, introduced and or amplified by foreign domestic threat actors.
[02:41:30.852 --> 02:41:32.632]  That's anyone who disagrees with CNN.
[02:41:33.132 --> 02:41:40.574]  The advisory goes on to assert the US is in a heightened threat landscape due to people posting images of grippers on Twitter.
[02:41:41.452 --> 02:41:57.659]  Or, no that's not a quote, the quote is the proliferation of false or misleading narratives which sow discord or undermine public trust in US government institutions because God forbid American citizens should have a healthy distrust of government institutions.
[02:41:58.419 --> 02:42:00.660]  That's domestic terrorism if ever I heard it.
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:06.382]  Apparently lack of trust in the Biden administration, legacy media represents a terrorist threat.
[02:42:07.623 --> 02:42:22.094]   And as we Explaining this article, previous DHS bulletins have even suggested that Americans who are angry at Covid lockdown rules, God forbid, or who express concerns about election integrity, are potential extremist threats.
[02:42:22.735 --> 02:42:33.516]   Now we also have the DHS, this is out of the Epoch Times, posted on Zero Hedge, Expressing concern about potential truck convoy protests in America.
[02:42:33.956 --> 02:42:40.322]  Yes, those dangerous Canadians with their unacceptable opinions, according to blackface Justin Trudeau.
[02:42:41.443 --> 02:42:52.172]  Their movement may be mimicked in America, and now the US Department of Homeland Security has confirmed it's tracking potential truck convoys who, God forbid, might honk their horns!
[02:42:53.231 --> 02:43:04.157]  Never seen such a disgraceful act of domestic terrorism as honking a horn in the United States after Canadian protests against Covid-19 vaccine mandates unfolded in multiple cities.
[02:43:04.977 --> 02:43:07.999]  There's no evidence that there's even this protest about to happen.
[02:43:08.039 --> 02:43:13.022]  Maybe it is, but they're treating it as a potential terrorist threat because they hate the American people.
[02:43:13.742 --> 02:43:22.453]   Meanwhile, RT reports Paris bans freedom convoys Paris authorities on Thursday issued an order saying that people can't protest.
[02:43:22.533 --> 02:43:23.734]  That's an illegal order.
[02:43:24.034 --> 02:43:27.975]  Your right to protest is enshrined in basic human freedoms.
[02:43:29.355 --> 02:43:36.377]  RT also reports EU capital, Brussels, where the most popular boy's name is now Mohammed because it's so European.
[02:43:36.898 --> 02:43:39.798]  EU capital bans freedom convoy protest.
[02:43:40.299 --> 02:43:48.802]   Brussels Mayor Philippe Close has announced also that he will ban A protest convoy of truckers who will be barred from entering the city.
[02:43:49.302 --> 02:43:54.044]  Again, no dissent allowed, but these are the good people, listen to them.
[02:43:54.465 --> 02:44:03.329]  I'm going to come back in the final five minutes of this segment and cover some key final news stories, but first I want to go to this final video.
[02:44:03.949 --> 02:44:16.901]  Which is based on a recently revealed report, summarised, written for the Department of Defence, actually written in 2013, but only recently revealed as a result of a Freedom of Information Act request.
[02:44:17.882 --> 02:44:34.299]   And in this DoD report it says, bear in mind this is back in 2013, this is even worse now, that China Views the West's embrace of multiculturalism and wokeism as a quote sickness that will ultimately bring about the collapse.
[02:44:34.899 --> 02:44:50.306]  Beijing sees the United States' obsession with racism and white guilt, which is obviously proven in the teaching of critical race theory throughout American schools, as quote a strategic vulnerability that will lead to its downfall.
[02:44:50.486 --> 02:44:51.187]  Here's the clip.
[02:44:51.166 --> 02:44:51.966]  Let's go to it.
[02:44:51.966 --> 02:44:57.166]  [Music]
[02:44:57.166 --> 02:45:02.925]   Ever wondered what major foreign powers think about America and the West's obsession with racism?
[02:45:03.073 --> 02:45:06.296]  Our increasingly absurd insistence that diversity is a strength?
[02:45:06.457 --> 02:45:12.062]  Our progressively more desperate search for the benefits of multiculturalism besides cheap labor and Uber Eats?
[02:45:12.162 --> 02:45:13.143]  I wonder no more.
[02:45:13.304 --> 02:45:19.589]   A fascinating, once-secret Department of Defense report contains some fascinating answers.
[02:45:19.609 --> 02:45:27.254]  The report was commissioned by foreign policy strategist Andrew Marshall and is titled Strategic Consequences of Chinese Racism.
[02:45:27.314 --> 02:45:30.656]  It was released as a result of Freedom of Information Act litigation.
[02:45:30.716 --> 02:45:35.158]  And despite originally being written in 2013, it's more relevant than ever.
[02:45:35.298 --> 02:45:40.762]  A lengthy Twitter thread highlights the key takeaways from the once confidential investigation.
[02:45:40.842 --> 02:46:01.859]   The banner headline, the Chinese see multiculturalism as a sickness China acknowledges that it is a racist country, but sees that as no problem whatsoever, and in fact views the United States' obsession with racism and white guilt as a quote strategic vulnerability.
[02:46:01.959 --> 02:46:10.426]  China once respected the United States because it was unicultural and quote defined by the centrality of Anglo-Protestant culture.
[02:46:10.506 --> 02:46:11.967]  What defines America now?
[02:46:12.688 --> 02:46:14.990]  Giant billboards celebrating obese black women.
[02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:18.313]  White kids in schools being taught they were born with original sin.
[02:46:18.393 --> 02:46:21.956]  Questions over whether white people should be allowed to use non-white emojis.
[02:46:22.036 --> 02:46:23.357]  George Floyd statues.
[02:46:26.500 --> 02:46:30.523]  I think what annoys me most about white people is when they pretend like they're the victim.
[02:46:31.775 --> 02:46:38.823]  The author of the DoD report acknowledges that CRT was prevalent in Hollywood and television a decade ago.
[02:46:38.903 --> 02:46:43.688]  Hollywood television magazines and more recently blogs take the issue of racism very seriously.
[02:46:44.068 --> 02:46:50.135]  Anti-racist messages are common in film and television, while positive images of racial minorities are heavily emphasised.
[02:46:50.615 --> 02:47:03.707]  Hollywood and television take their monitoring and policing of the public sphere seriously and work to identify violators and punishing them through ridicule or through expulsion from the community and acceptable company.
[02:47:03.747 --> 02:47:09.132]  So the deep state was already praising cancel culture before cancel culture was even a thing.
[02:47:09.332 --> 02:47:15.218]  Also note the acknowledgement and veneration of critical race theory, which leftists still claim doesn't even exist.
[02:47:15.438 --> 02:47:24.421]  The primary and secondary educational system has been completely remade since the 1970s to emphasize the contributions of racial minorities and the dangers of racism.
[02:47:24.821 --> 02:47:33.084]  The students receive instruction about the evils of prejudice and bigotry from K-12, while positive education about minorities is heavily emphasized.
[02:47:33.544 --> 02:47:44.069]  For the American student today, anti-racism and minority history months are as much a part of his primary and secondary education as instruction in mathematics, government, or physical education.
[02:47:44.129 --> 02:47:57.835]  The author then notes how racism, xenophobia, and ethnocentrism as an innate survival mechanism isn't unique to the Chinese, but in fact represents, quote, common behaviors found worldwide and universally.
[02:47:57.915 --> 02:48:05.400]   The report comments on how the Chinese, specifically the Han, view themselves as, quote, a single pure race.
[02:48:05.501 --> 02:48:11.426]  And that their worldview is predicated on the idea that, quote, the greatest force is common blood.
[02:48:11.546 --> 02:48:22.057]  Unlike Westerners, the Chinese strongly believe the Maoist assertion that national unity is dependent not just on cultural values, but on, quote, biological continuity.
[02:48:22.097 --> 02:48:30.483]   The DoD author notes that the Chinese embrace racism Not just as an innate reflexive mindset, but as a source of great strength.
[02:48:30.623 --> 02:48:35.326]  And that that's, quote, a huge advantage for the Chinese over the West.
[02:48:35.266 --> 02:48:43.387]   According to Chinese thinking, "Racism is a Western problem, the artifact of Western history and Western culture, and it
[02:48:43.387 --> 02:48:45.506]  must be said, a Western obsession.
[02:48:45.506 --> 02:48:51.527]   It is also a Western weakness. The obsession with race and race guilt introduces a vulnerability into Western
[02:48:51.527 --> 02:48:55.266]  societies that many non-Western peoples have exploited.
[02:48:55.266 --> 02:49:02.306]   More importantly, it has led to a loss of confidence in the West, in its identity, while fracturing its cohesion."
[02:49:02.443 --> 02:49:15.169]  Chinese racism towards people with darker skin colours is contrasted by their genetic exaltation of white people, which is why the phenomenon of Chinese women seeking out white men for procreation continues to be a strong trend.
[02:49:15.249 --> 02:49:22.032]   On the flip side, their view of black people is that they're, quote, Ugly, uncivilized, and have a low degree of intelligence.
[02:49:22.172 --> 02:49:28.875]  Elsewhere in the document, it's explained how the Chinese view blacks as, quote, prone to crime, particularly violent crime.
[02:49:28.935 --> 02:49:37.760]  This racist doctrine was also evident when Air China published an edition of their official magazine, which warns Chinese tourists about visiting London.
[02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:40.661]  Quote, London is generally a safe place to travel.
[02:49:40.981 --> 02:49:46.564]  However, precautions are needed when entering areas mainly populated by Indians, Pakistanis, and black people.
[02:49:46.664 --> 02:49:56.930]  This racist view also informs Chinese commercial expansion into Africa, with the Chinese believing they have the right to exploit Africans due to their perceived superior racial heritage.
[02:49:56.970 --> 02:50:10.498]  The Chinese are perplexed that the West has abandoned the American creed in favor of, quote, an explicitly multiracial, multicultural society that celebrates differences rather than acquiring assimilation.
[02:50:10.598 --> 02:50:24.310]  In rejecting the West's core principles and replacing them with adulation of any culture that isn't Western, the United States is, according to China, quote, rejecting the principles that made the country great and united it.
[02:50:24.391 --> 02:50:36.942]  The march of multiculturalism is, again, according to the Chinese, a sickness that, quote, conspires to cause the breakdown of American society and the lack of purpose in life for most Americans.
[02:50:37.082 --> 02:50:48.471]  The DoD author notes that the Chinese don't feel the need to confront America militarily because they think the country will collapse of its own accord as a result of racial separatism and internal strife.
[02:50:50.312 --> 02:51:22.797]   Now you can watch the rest of that report on summit.news and in the video I make the point that the conclusion of that report that was given to the DoD back in 2013 was that to discredit the Chinese you needed to make the point that China was a racist country What we've actually seen, specifically over the past few years since the George Floyd riots, is the assertion by the US political class, not that China's a racist country, they don't really care about that, but that America is a racist country.
[02:51:22.837 --> 02:51:29.661]  So they literally followed the opposite advice of what they were told to do back in 2013 and it hasn't worked out so well for them, has it?
[02:51:30.433 --> 02:51:37.256]  On that subject, Information Liberation reports, DoD diversity and equality, equity, inclusion are necessities in U.S.
[02:51:37.296 --> 02:51:37.776]  military.
[02:51:37.796 --> 02:51:40.177]  They haven't really learned their lesson, have they?
[02:51:40.738 --> 02:51:52.403]  Department of Defense on Wednesday, and again that's the same bureaucracy that was handed this report back in 2013, posted an article claiming that diversity, equity and inclusion are necessities in the U.S.
[02:51:52.443 --> 02:51:54.644]  military and acts as a force multiplier.
[02:51:55.712 --> 02:52:11.743]  And basically the senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense for Human Capital, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, yes that's actually a job, Bishop Garrison, said that it's a necessity and in fact a strength of the US military to seek out diversity.
[02:52:11.803 --> 02:52:21.830]  I would argue it would be a strength to seek out the best people for the best possible roles that they're most skilled at regardless of their skin color, but we don't live in that world.
[02:52:22.955 --> 02:52:27.879]  Meanwhile, scientists discover genetic material suggesting Covid came from Chinese lab.
[02:52:28.139 --> 02:52:28.479]  What?
[02:52:29.060 --> 02:52:32.002]  But the fact checkers told me that was a racist conspiracy theory!
[02:52:32.805 --> 02:53:10.977]   Scientists in Hungary examining a unique variant of Covid-19 have discovered genetic material that suggests the strain was being examined in a Chinese lab, bolstering the lab leak theory, which of course the esteemed fact-checkers told us back in 2020 was fake news and led to the deplatforming, censorship and banishment of numerous prominent individuals, despite the fact that Peter Daszak, one of the guys over Facebook's fact-checking network, was intimately tied to the Wuhan lab and, in fact, investigated it as part of this discovery mission to try and find out if the virus was leaked from the lab.
[02:53:11.638 --> 02:53:28.286]   Of course, when Mr Daszak went to the lab with the other WHO investigators, they basically walked around for a couple of hours and asked some of the researchers at the Wuhan lab, oh, by the way, This coronavirus, this deadly pandemic, this COVID-19, did you release that?
[02:53:28.867 --> 02:53:31.309]  And they were told, no, we had nothing to do with it.
[02:53:31.790 --> 02:53:32.871]  OK, case closed.
[02:53:33.191 --> 02:53:33.952]  They all left.
[02:53:34.312 --> 02:53:39.257]  That was literally their investigation back in 2020.
[02:53:39.838 --> 02:53:46.805]  Now, genetic material from Chinese hamsters and green monkeys was discovered as part of this research project.
[02:53:47.873 --> 02:53:54.556]  Which, quote, may suggest the virus was being examined in a lab using either the animals themselves or their cells.
[02:53:55.396 --> 02:54:04.360]  Viscount Ridley said that such evidence bolsters the theory that the virus was accidentally escaped or was leaked deliberately from the Wuhan lab.
[02:54:04.440 --> 02:54:09.662]  So yet more evidence proving that it did indeed come from that lab.
[02:54:09.702 --> 02:54:13.563]  The thing that they told you was a racist conspiracy theory up until about a year ago.
[02:54:13.583 --> 02:54:14.824]  That's going to wrap it up.
[02:54:14.844 --> 02:54:15.884]  War Room is coming up next.
[02:54:15.904 --> 02:54:16.705]  Summit.News.
[02:54:16.524 --> 02:54:33.805]  News don't go away.
[02:54:33.813 --> 02:54:35.594]  It wasn't that expensive, a couple thousand dollars.
[02:54:36.294 --> 02:54:46.176]  But the paleontologists that curated it and mined this out of North Africa estimate that this is 30 million years old.
[02:54:46.556 --> 02:54:49.657]  These are fish that lived their lives and floated down on the bottom and died.
[02:54:50.762 --> 02:55:01.252]  Now, whether they died 10,000 years ago or 30 million years ago, like the scientists say, regardless, they were living little creatures that had a life and went through the different paces.
[02:55:02.092 --> 02:55:02.973]  But what about humans?
[02:55:04.394 --> 02:55:06.917]  We can envision all this incredible art.
[02:55:06.937 --> 02:55:14.324]  A photo of my daughter, a painting I did, a painting my older daughter did, a painting my uncle did who's been long dead when he was eight years old.
[02:55:15.182 --> 02:55:16.703]  Another painting my older daughter did.
[02:55:16.803 --> 02:55:18.483]  A painting my young daughter did.
[02:55:19.003 --> 02:55:21.905]  All of this is precious because it's consciousness.
[02:55:22.305 --> 02:55:23.865]  And it's things we're interfacing with.
[02:55:23.965 --> 02:55:29.507]  And the globalists don't want us to have any consciousness except ideas they pour into our brains.
[02:55:29.908 --> 02:55:32.188]  That's what the surveillance and the censorship is all about.
[02:55:32.208 --> 02:55:38.031]  And they're doing everything they can now to silence us and shut us down because they know I'm a populist.
[02:55:38.411 --> 02:55:39.391]  They know I believe in you.
[02:55:39.711 --> 02:55:40.472]  I believe in myself.
[02:55:40.852 --> 02:55:41.632]  I believe in humanity.
[02:55:42.152 --> 02:55:45.620]   So that's why as we hurdle Into the year 2022.
[02:55:47.762 --> 02:55:50.223]  Hell, today is February 2nd, 2022.
[02:55:51.444 --> 02:55:53.205]  Two, two, two, two.
[02:55:54.326 --> 02:55:56.467]  How would you say it, Rob?
[02:55:57.027 --> 02:55:58.228]  Two, two, two, two, two.
[02:55:58.488 --> 02:56:00.109]  Yeah, two, two, two, two, two.
[02:56:00.450 --> 02:56:02.091]  Here we are together, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:02.611 --> 02:56:04.472]  And just look at this, you know, my grandmother.
[02:56:04.492 --> 02:56:07.914]  50-something years ago.
[02:56:08.575 --> 02:56:09.835]  Hell, my mom's 70-something.
[02:56:09.855 --> 02:56:12.237]  60-something years ago, my mom was a little girl.
[02:56:12.757 --> 02:56:18.363]   She watched her mother Knit that little hedgehog together.
[02:56:18.383 --> 02:56:19.684]  And here's one of my great daughters.
[02:56:20.685 --> 02:56:22.668]  My middle daughter with my younger daughter.
[02:56:22.688 --> 02:56:24.049]  This is just so magic.
[02:56:24.069 --> 02:56:25.490]  This is what life's about.
[02:56:25.531 --> 02:56:28.834]  It's about this great experience that we have together.
[02:56:29.815 --> 02:56:34.700]  Here's a little painting I did years ago, probably 20 years ago now, of the Japanese wave.
[02:56:36.923 --> 02:56:40.025]  There's a little art piece my four-year-old daughter did and here's something I did.
[02:56:40.385 --> 02:56:42.787]  The point is, this is all what life's about.
[02:56:43.167 --> 02:56:45.088]  It's our experiences and our love together.
[02:56:45.469 --> 02:56:48.170]  And these tyrants are trying to shut that down and we can't let them.
[02:56:48.511 --> 02:56:50.172]  And we can't let them shut M4Horse down.
[02:56:50.792 --> 02:56:55.115]  And so now, I tell the listeners and viewers, we need your support more than ever.
[02:56:55.655 --> 02:56:59.798]   And everything we promote, everything we sell, Empowers you as well.
[02:56:59.838 --> 02:57:00.718]  It's a 360 win.
[02:57:01.358 --> 02:57:03.519]  So please, word of mouth, spread the word.
[02:57:04.059 --> 02:57:14.202]  Please pray for us and please go to InfoWars4.com right now and get the great supplements, the great t-shirts, the great products that keep us on air because I don't want the globals to be successful.
[02:57:14.682 --> 02:57:15.962]  I don't want them to shut us down.
[02:57:16.362 --> 02:57:19.323]  I don't want them to silence me or you or anybody else.
[02:57:20.304 --> 02:57:21.004]  I know we're going to win.
[02:57:21.957 --> 02:57:23.859]  And Inforce has come so far together.
[02:57:24.620 --> 02:57:26.962]  And I don't think our fight has ended.
[02:57:27.102 --> 02:57:32.107]  But if it does end, I understand I've had a big, successful role here.
[02:57:33.889 --> 02:57:37.772]  But regardless, whatever you do, I want you to keep on fighting and never stop and never surrender.
[02:57:38.092 --> 02:57:53.531]  God bless and good luck.
[02:57:53.563 --> 02:57:54.703]  It is the good halogen.
[02:57:54.904 --> 02:58:03.086]  The UN admits 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities on the face of the earth today.
[02:58:04.267 --> 02:58:09.528]  That's over 20% because they have had iodine deficiencies.
[02:58:10.449 --> 02:58:12.469]  Now we've got two different great iodine products.
[02:58:12.489 --> 02:58:16.931]  We've got X2, it's amazing, pure deep earth crystal atomic iodine.
[02:58:17.503 --> 02:58:18.744]  And it's been sold out for a while.
[02:58:19.164 --> 02:58:21.025]  We finally got X3 back in.
[02:58:21.566 --> 02:58:23.307]  That is the deep earth crystal iodine.
[02:58:23.827 --> 02:58:25.388]  And then two other types.
[02:58:25.909 --> 02:58:29.491]  Because some studies show it helps with the absorption of the pure iodine.
[02:58:29.751 --> 02:58:30.712]  So it's apples and oranges.
[02:58:31.352 --> 02:58:32.453]  Both formulas are excellent.
[02:58:32.473 --> 02:58:36.316]  People constantly ask me, including on the street, what's better X2 or X3?
[02:58:37.636 --> 02:58:38.297]  Apples and oranges.
[02:58:38.377 --> 02:58:43.060]  It's like, do you like iceberg lettuce or do you like spinach?
[02:58:43.100 --> 02:58:44.961]  I mean, it's two different things.
[02:58:45.142 --> 02:58:48.330]   Or it's like, A tomato versus a potato.
[02:58:49.350 --> 02:58:51.931]  Bottom line, your body needs iodine.
[02:58:52.752 --> 02:58:57.013]  And the globalists are bombarding all of us with bad halogens.
[02:58:57.253 --> 02:58:59.354]  Fluoride, bromine, chloride.
[02:59:00.075 --> 02:59:05.937]  All of those systems that block fertility, block our electrochemical cells, block our immune system.
[02:59:05.997 --> 02:59:11.380]  So, just on the immune system front, so many people have deficiencies in iodine.
[02:59:11.700 --> 02:59:18.323]   So, X X3 is back in stock for being sold out for four months at 50% off.
[02:59:18.363 --> 02:59:23.585]  So for your libido, your stamina, your energy, everything, try X3 today.
