[00:00.000 --> 00:24.940]  All you have to do is check out what I'm saying, and that's why they run the fake headline
[00:24.940 --> 00:32.340]  against myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere, every day. Jones admits he's an actor, or
[00:32.340 --> 00:37.840]  Tucker Carlson says nobody would take me seriously. Where do we say that? We never said that.
[00:37.840 --> 00:44.040]  They just say we said that. But where's the clip? Where's the article? Where do we say
[00:44.040 --> 00:45.940]  that? It doesn't exist.
[00:45.940 --> 00:50.340]  Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist.
[00:50.340 --> 00:53.440]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show.
[00:53.440 --> 00:58.040]  The radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act.
[00:58.040 --> 01:03.640]  He's actually a performance artist. He's a performance artist. Alex Jones is a fake.
[01:03.640 --> 01:09.940]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid, and it's all based on the custody
[01:09.940 --> 01:14.280]  battle of my ex-wife five years ago, and she was trying to put into evidence to be dressed
[01:14.280 --> 01:19.940]  up more than a decade before, like the Joker, being sarcastic saying, take your Prozac kids,
[01:19.940 --> 01:26.140]  take your illegal drugs too, you'll die, it's fun, so people wouldn't take drugs. And they
[01:26.140 --> 01:30.040]  wanted to enter that in evidence. They look, he's insane telling kids to use drugs, and
[01:30.040 --> 01:35.180]  my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks that's
[01:35.180 --> 01:43.620]  really Jack Nicholson. So yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander, or Optimus Prime, or
[01:43.620 --> 01:55.560]  the Joker, because I can do imitations of them all really good, or Darth Vader. Do I really
[01:55.560 --> 02:00.640]  think I'm Darth Vader? No. Do I think I'm Optimus Prime, Cobra Commander, the Joker?
[02:00.640 --> 02:06.720]  No. And clearly, no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire that what I'm
[02:06.720 --> 02:11.720]  saying is what I really think. No one believes the Babylon Bee. It's not trying to lie to
[02:11.720 --> 02:17.680]  you, it's being sarcastic. By the Vaccinate Meow Moodle today, it's required by the CDC.
[02:17.680 --> 02:22.760]  But they play those games, and that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to.
[02:22.760 --> 02:27.400]  Even though I tell people, okay, this is a joke, this isn't serious, they clip it out,
[02:27.400 --> 02:33.880]  and they say, no, this is what he really believes. Every day when I leave work, I do this. That
[02:33.880 --> 02:37.560]  man's threatened this country. And they go, look, he admitted in court, he's an actor.
[02:37.560 --> 02:43.640]  Well, yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly, I was an actor in Waking Life, I was an actor
[02:43.640 --> 02:50.720]  when I was Cobra Commander. But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host,
[02:50.720 --> 02:55.240]  up here reading news articles to you, isn't a real thing, and isn't something I'm actually
[02:55.240 --> 02:59.720]  saying, and you know that. You're insulted right now, I'm even explaining that to you,
[02:59.720 --> 03:07.240]  and so am I, but that's who these people are. You don't know the power of the dark
[03:07.240 --> 03:14.280]  side. Am I really Darth Vader? Nick Alex Jones seems really talented, he's smart,
[03:14.280 --> 03:18.040]  he's funny as hell, he's truly funny. I'm kind of retarded.
[03:26.280 --> 03:32.680]  Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes, you now not listen to what I
[03:32.680 --> 03:38.760]  say about other things when I show you a powerful news article by Dr. Joseph Mercola on infowars.com,
[03:38.760 --> 03:44.120]  it has all the cited information, the latest tragedy, sudden adult death syndrome. No,
[03:44.120 --> 03:50.120]  that's a real thing. That's something happening in the real world, and that's what we're breaking
[03:50.120 --> 03:56.920]  down here today. I am Alex Jones, and I am the guy on this show every day. I am an American,
[03:56.920 --> 04:02.680]  and that's what I promote, is freedom, and justice, and liberty, and they can't stand it.
[04:12.280 --> 04:14.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.
[04:14.680 --> 04:27.160]  Get ready, folks, this is my Thursday broadcast.
[04:27.160 --> 04:31.480]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's
[04:31.480 --> 04:36.120]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[04:36.120 --> 04:48.600]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[05:00.280 --> 05:05.240]  People ask me all the time, what is your best at troping? You've got turbo force,
[05:05.240 --> 05:10.120]  you've got brain force plus, and you've got brain force ultra. Which one is better?
[05:10.840 --> 05:18.920]  And that's like asking, what's better, a Ford F-150, or a Cadillac, or a Ferrari.
[05:19.800 --> 05:24.520]  It's different strokes for different folks. It varies, all three are different formulas,
[05:25.240 --> 05:31.320]  all three do different things. Turbo force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy,
[05:31.320 --> 05:36.840]  I can't even take a whole pack myself. Brain force plus is a long term acting, clean,
[05:36.840 --> 05:42.920]  neutropic. This brain force ultra is a super fast acting, neutropic thing.
[05:43.800 --> 05:48.520]  Creates incredible clarity, but doesn't last very long. They're all three different formulas.
[05:48.520 --> 05:55.880]  And finally, back in stock, massively discounted, brain force ultra is available at infowarstore.com.
[05:55.880 --> 06:01.640]  Brain force ultra, back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[06:11.480 --> 06:17.640]  Resistance to tyrants, his obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[06:20.440 --> 06:24.360]  Thanks for joining us on this live, Teleproper Tree, original pro-human
[06:24.360 --> 06:27.800]  transmission, it's Thursday, September 8th, 2022.
[06:30.120 --> 06:36.440]  And literally 10 minutes ago, before the show started, I ended an hour long interview with
[06:37.240 --> 06:41.080]  now the most man-man in the world, one of the most censored people on the planet,
[06:41.640 --> 06:46.680]  Andrew Tate. And it was an amazing interview. He's hosted the show, he's been a guest many times,
[06:46.680 --> 06:49.560]  he's come to Austin and visited, I've gone out to dinner with him and his brother.
[06:49.560 --> 06:53.640]  He's a really smart guy, and they're misrepresenting who he is, because they're scared of male
[06:53.640 --> 06:59.720]  leadership and his message of not being depressed and having a destiny.
[07:00.840 --> 07:07.240]  So, I'm going to air some excerpts tomorrow of the interview on the Friday show.
[07:08.040 --> 07:14.280]  And then Monday, I'm going to Dallas to be on Steven Crowder's show, but
[07:14.280 --> 07:22.840]  the first hour, Monday, will be the Andrew Tate interview in full. It'll go into the
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.520]  second hour as well, because we have 15 minutes or 14 minutes of ads an hour, so we're going to try
[07:28.520 --> 07:32.680]  to air a close to hour long interview, it'll take more than an hour. So, Monday, Andrew Tate,
[07:32.680 --> 07:36.760]  the big interview, but we're going to have some excerpts. It was an incredible interview that
[07:36.760 --> 07:41.720]  just ended literally, like, now about 13, 14 minutes ago. We're seven and a half minutes
[07:41.720 --> 07:47.320]  into the broadcast right now, and he knocked it out of the park. And it's all about victory and
[07:47.320 --> 07:50.920]  how to defeat the New World Order, and it's the essence of victory, and it's why they're so scared
[07:50.920 --> 07:54.840]  of us. So, we didn't have time to grab any of the best excerpts out, because it just ended,
[07:56.280 --> 08:00.360]  but here is just the first five and a half minutes of the interview, and then we're going to kick
[08:00.360 --> 08:07.000]  off all this incredible breaking news. Stay with us. Well, I'm known as the most controversial man
[08:07.000 --> 08:13.800]  in America, probably the world, except now somebody's giving me a really good run
[08:13.800 --> 08:17.480]  for my money, and he's a good friend of mine. He's a good friend of Paul Watson.
[08:18.040 --> 08:21.560]  We've hung out. He's been on the show many times. He's hosted the show. He's Andrew Tate,
[08:21.560 --> 08:27.000]  the most searched individual in the last six months on the Internet every single day,
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.760]  and he is just on fire with the young people with a really good, strong, pro-human message
[08:32.760 --> 08:37.560]  that completely threatens the power structure, because they want us to be weak. They want us
[08:37.560 --> 08:43.160]  to be victims, and Andrew Tate is the opposite. But what really freaks people out is that their
[08:43.160 --> 08:48.200]  daughters are listening to Andrew Tate. I was having dinner a few days ago with another good
[08:48.200 --> 08:51.480]  friend of mine that's a well-known podcaster, and he brought up Andrew Tate, and he said,
[08:51.480 --> 08:56.680]  yeah, it's really crazy. My daughters are big fans, and those are high school daughters. So,
[08:56.680 --> 09:06.040]  Andrew Tate has broken through, absolutely, massively, and had a gigantic effect, and the power
[09:06.040 --> 09:12.520]  structure is insanely scared of him. Now, if he was a bad guy and had this much influence,
[09:12.520 --> 09:17.240]  and they didn't control him, they'd be coming after him. But he's a good guy with incredible
[09:17.960 --> 09:24.920]  pull, and that scares them to their very core, and that's why this hour-long interview,
[09:24.920 --> 09:31.560]  uncensored, is so critical. Andrew Tate being able to speak for himself, because now he's become one
[09:31.560 --> 09:36.600]  of the most banned men in the world. There's only a few other people out there. Donald Trump is one
[09:36.600 --> 09:40.280]  of them. I'd say in the top three most banned people in the world, it's Andrew Tate, Alex Jones,
[09:40.280 --> 09:44.520]  and Donald Trump. That's why this interview is so incredibly important. We're in a club,
[09:44.520 --> 09:48.600]  it's a pretty elite club, and it's because we scare the establishment. Andrew Tate, great to
[09:48.600 --> 09:53.880]  have you here, my friend. Absolutely glad to be here, and that's a pretty good club to be part of.
[09:53.880 --> 10:02.600]  So I'm almost happy for the membership. Where to start? The ban, what you're going through,
[10:02.600 --> 10:05.240]  what's unfolding, what's coming next? We're going into so much here today.
[10:06.520 --> 10:12.520]  Yeah, it was the Matrix attacked me. I knew they always would. They attacked in a very clever
[10:12.520 --> 10:18.520]  manner. I received a strike on YouTube, which prevents you from posting for seven days.
[10:18.520 --> 10:24.120]  After I received the strike, Metta banned me, which is Instagram and Facebook. They banned me.
[10:24.120 --> 10:28.680]  I filmed a YouTube video to reply to the ban while I still had my YouTube account,
[10:28.680 --> 10:31.800]  because they're pretending they're fair and that it all doesn't happen in sync.
[10:31.800 --> 10:37.320]  They allowed my YouTube account to survive for four more days, and then they banned my YouTube
[10:37.320 --> 10:43.160]  account. So the strike was given to me on purpose to make sure that I couldn't post my reply video
[10:43.160 --> 10:47.320]  directly after the first ban, and for them to pretend that there was some kind of degree
[10:47.320 --> 10:53.240]  of separation between the large Matrix attacks. I've been banned on basically every single platform
[10:53.240 --> 10:57.400]  from Airbnb to Uber through to social media platforms, payment processors, absolutely
[10:57.400 --> 11:03.720]  everything. And you're completely right. I teach people and inspire people to think for themselves,
[11:03.720 --> 11:07.480]  and that makes you the enemy of the establishment, because you are not allowed to think. You're
[11:07.480 --> 11:13.160]  only allowed to comply. Let's walk through that, because before we started this interview today,
[11:13.160 --> 11:18.200]  you said the most important point is once they silence you, then they can tell whatever lies
[11:18.200 --> 11:22.040]  about you. You're not just putting the Phantom Zone. Now they can misrepresent who you are.
[11:23.400 --> 11:27.160]  Absolutely. And that's the number one intention, right? Because when these large companies decide
[11:27.160 --> 11:32.440]  to ban somebody, they also monitor in real time public perception, social media comments and
[11:32.440 --> 11:37.800]  posts, and how people feel about their decision. So to make sure they don't look tyrannical,
[11:37.800 --> 11:42.200]  after they ban you, they used a media machine to lie about you and paint an error if you're the
[11:42.200 --> 11:47.080]  worst person in the world to try and convince the populace that your ban was actually a good thing,
[11:47.080 --> 11:51.960]  so they can get away with their actions unscathed. The lies are a very, very important part of their
[11:51.960 --> 11:57.080]  plan. They're always pre-orchestrated, and they come in hard and fast and heavy across every
[11:57.080 --> 12:02.120]  single mainstream media outlet in real time. As soon as you've been banned, you can no longer
[12:02.120 --> 12:07.160]  defend yourself. You are defenseless. And what you just said is so incredibly critical, and that's
[12:07.160 --> 12:16.840]  why they're scared of you. When they began their purge of info wars in August of 2018, Tim Cook
[12:16.840 --> 12:22.840]  later bragged that he met that Sunday night with the heads of the big six tech companies. That's
[12:22.840 --> 12:26.920]  how important the censorship is. And it wasn't just about Alex Jones who's about setting this
[12:26.920 --> 12:31.960]  precedent and how they first decided to have YouTube shut me down, first was the strike so we
[12:31.960 --> 12:37.320]  couldn't respond. It's all very strategic. This is admitted by the way. Cook's give interviews to
[12:37.320 --> 12:48.200]  Vice and you name it. Then Facebook, Instagram, all of the major sites, over 60 of them even linked in,
[12:48.760 --> 12:57.080]  then banned me two days after the YouTube strike, and it was all very, very strategic. And this
[12:57.080 --> 13:01.720]  is a battle plan and they now admit it's a battle plan, which they later used on Donald Trump
[13:01.720 --> 13:06.440]  as well. And now they're using it's millions of not just Americans, but people all over the world.
[13:06.440 --> 13:12.520]  And we see the videos in Europe in the UK, where the man criticizes transgenderism and puts up a
[13:12.520 --> 13:18.120]  transgender flag with a swastika on it, and they come and arrest the veteran at his home. So
[13:18.120 --> 13:23.400]  whatever you see being done to and rotate now shown to Donald Trump today will end up being done to
[13:23.400 --> 13:28.440]  you. This is a blueprint where they pick out the alpha males that they see on the vanguard,
[13:28.440 --> 13:34.760]  because they're really coming after everybody else. And obviously at the start of an interview,
[13:34.760 --> 13:38.200]  I do most of the talking, but he did most of the talking after that. It was an extremely powerful
[13:38.200 --> 13:41.240]  interview. That's just the first five and a half minutes of it that we can grab quickly.
[13:41.240 --> 13:46.840]  So just did the interview before we went live here today. Okay, man, we got big news today.
[13:47.640 --> 13:54.280]  We have got so much to cover, so much to go over. It is just crazy. And I was watching a Joe
[13:54.280 --> 13:59.000]  Rogan clip this morning at about 6am of Eddie Bravo when he was here visiting last week,
[13:59.800 --> 14:05.080]  where Eddie brought up something really important I'd forgotten about that is so central. And that's
[14:05.080 --> 14:11.160]  that CNN top producer was caught on tape almost a year ago saying when we're done with COVID,
[14:12.680 --> 14:17.320]  in comes the climate change, the lockdowns, the energy crisis, which again, we knew that,
[14:17.320 --> 14:24.040]  but it's them admitting it. Where are the congressional investigations? This stuff is so
[14:24.040 --> 14:28.920]  transparent, how the Rockefeller Foundation said we'll use viruses to take over and Bill Gates said
[14:28.920 --> 14:33.720]  that and so did Fauci and then they do it. And then this is even more transparent, they're admitting
[14:35.080 --> 14:39.640]  how they're going to collapse society and force us into their control under a universal basic
[14:39.640 --> 14:47.160]  income that's controlled and manipulated by the social credit score and the carbon tax and more
[14:47.160 --> 14:52.360]  which is now being built on the vaccine passport system. Everything we told you is now here and
[14:52.360 --> 14:56.440]  things just get a hell of a lot worse the longer we stay under it. The good news is there are
[14:56.440 --> 15:02.520]  rebellions against the New World Order and against the WEF all over the world. People aren't protesting
[15:02.520 --> 15:07.880]  their governments. They're protesting the WEF control of their governments from Canada to Brazil,
[15:08.440 --> 15:12.760]  from the United States to Australia and it is incredibly exciting. In fact, there was a couple
[15:12.760 --> 15:17.160]  members of the Australian Senate, a bunch of others, I forgot. I don't see the Bolsonaro clip on here
[15:17.160 --> 15:22.360]  either showing that giant crowd of like 5 million people or more. I want to show that too when we
[15:22.360 --> 15:28.600]  come back because this is massive. What is going down is incredible. We were already supposed to
[15:28.600 --> 15:33.480]  be off here, we were supposed to be neutralized by now, but we weren't. And we've got several big
[15:33.480 --> 15:39.160]  special guests today, one up in studio and Andrew Torbo has got some huge news from Gab, the CEO of
[15:39.160 --> 15:45.160]  Gab coming up the next hour and we'll take calls as well, infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today,

[17:08.680 --> 17:13.160]  done these profiles. You see it every year, 30 different tax returns, 30 different answers,
[17:13.160 --> 17:18.760]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers and almost all of them just screw you over,
[17:18.760 --> 17:23.160]  especially the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't

[20:41.320 --> 20:51.320]  oh
[20:52.520 --> 20:55.320]  that's what it's all about
[20:56.520 --> 21:01.560]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen we are broadcasting worldwide from the embattled
[21:01.560 --> 21:11.560]  battle hardened info wars complex in atx texas
[21:12.280 --> 21:16.440]  oh we got a big broadcast today big gas huge news it's just insane
[21:17.960 --> 21:21.480]  but i saw a clip this morning when i got up at like five a.m i was drinking coffee
[21:22.040 --> 21:24.760]  of eddie bravo on joe rogan when he was here visiting us last week
[21:24.760 --> 21:34.760]  and he made this point to me and joe at dinner saturday and i i just thought about it at the
[21:34.760 --> 21:38.440]  time but forgot that i was going to make a big point about that and i hadn't seen the podcast
[21:38.440 --> 21:43.080]  any other few days before so i didn't realize he talked about it there but eddie's like listen
[21:43.080 --> 21:47.320]  you got to make a bigger deal about that project veritas where that big producer said after the
[21:47.320 --> 21:51.160]  cova the next big scare will be the climate change and all the rest of it i'm like you're
[21:51.160 --> 21:56.360]  right that was big i need to play that and i forgot about it then again this morning i saw it and
[21:56.360 --> 22:01.560]  really hit me these project veritas things come out and each of them is more damning the last
[22:02.520 --> 22:08.120]  and they get censored they get blocked and then now we're living in the future of that
[22:08.120 --> 22:12.280]  prediction coming true showing it's completely made up we're not having record temperatures
[22:12.280 --> 22:18.440]  we're the ice caps are bigger than ever recorded that's a fact and here they are admitting they
[22:18.440 --> 22:24.760]  know it's a lie this is smoking gun information so this didn't really go viral when it broke
[22:24.760 --> 22:32.280]  eight nine ten months ago how long ago was it but it needs to go viral now because it's a big big deal
[22:36.280 --> 22:40.680]  these people are a fraud and and they they got a lot of power and made a lot of money and hurt a
[22:40.680 --> 22:44.920]  lot of people with their shots but the world's turning against them we've got to break the back
[22:44.920 --> 22:53.400]  of this man-made climate change bull and listing carbon is evil in fact i want you to play these
[22:53.400 --> 22:58.920]  two clips of first eddie on joe rogan then the actual veritas clip then i want to play godfrey
[22:58.920 --> 23:04.680]  bloom in the european union parliament in 2009 predicting what this would do let's play let's
[23:04.680 --> 23:09.800]  play all three of those clips here back to back because they again just like mild clips predicting
[23:09.800 --> 23:14.680]  stuff coming true or powerful what about seeing and confessing to the next stage of fraud and
[23:14.680 --> 23:17.560]  now here we are almost a year later and they're doing it here it is
[23:21.000 --> 23:27.480]  project veritas video where they it's an undercover video someone at cnn is going um
[23:27.480 --> 23:32.120]  oh yeah as soon as we're done with covid we're gonna hit climate change real hard we're just gonna
[23:32.120 --> 23:37.800]  scare everybody with climate change i thought once that got out they were gonna pull the plug
[23:37.800 --> 23:42.440]  on the climate change push i go now they can't do it look at these guys they they busted them
[23:42.440 --> 23:47.800]  but they didn't give a shit they they moved forward you know what i'm talking about that clip
[23:47.800 --> 23:52.760]  that's the end clip uh from project veritas yeah they they were saying that that's the next thing
[23:52.760 --> 23:58.840]  that they're gonna push really hard the same way they push uh covid look i don't know any uh it's
[23:58.840 --> 24:05.400]  very suspicious that uh knowing that that's what they're gonna push and they're gonna push it once
[24:05.400 --> 24:08.520]  covid's done they're gonna push climate change and then you're seeing all this climate change
[24:08.520 --> 24:15.800]  being pushed and then you you you listen to all the people pushing nothing but demons pushing that
[24:15.800 --> 24:19.960]  shit it's the same people listen to all the other shit they're saying there's they're all
[24:20.760 --> 24:25.880]  saying it together pushing it together along with all the other bullshit so right there i'm like okay
[24:25.880 --> 24:31.560]  this story comes up they're gonna latch on to it they've already announced in her office that
[24:31.560 --> 24:39.720]  that once the public is will be open to it we're gonna start focusing mainly on climate
[24:44.680 --> 24:49.000]  climate like global warming and like that's gonna be our next like um
[24:56.120 --> 25:01.080]  it's gonna be our focus like uh like our focus was to get trump out of office right
[25:01.080 --> 25:05.480]  without saying it that's what it was right so our next thing is going to be for climate change
[25:05.480 --> 25:11.080]  awareness what does that look like i don't know i'm not sure i i have a feeling it's just going to be
[25:11.080 --> 25:22.520]  like constantly showing videos of like decline and ice and weather warming up and like the effects
[25:22.520 --> 25:33.400]  of having an economy and really just ahead of the network like just i imagine that he's got his
[25:33.400 --> 25:40.600]  council and they've all like discussed like where they think um so that's like the next
[25:42.680 --> 25:49.480]  pandemic like story like that will yeah that will will be to death but that one's got longevity
[25:49.480 --> 25:56.200]  you know what i mean it's not like there's a definitive ending to the pandemic or you know
[25:57.480 --> 26:01.880]  it'll taper off to a point that it's not a problem anymore probably they're gonna take the year so
[26:02.680 --> 26:06.280]  they'll probably be able to milk that for quite a bit you know
[26:06.280 --> 26:15.960]  okay so i'm gonna change overload be prepared it's
[26:16.680 --> 26:25.320]  stories like right now um we have an inside track right now where two stories are going to be
[26:25.320 --> 26:39.000]  pushed climate change is going to be the next we're gonna we're gonna focus on
[26:44.040 --> 26:47.800]  you said it's going to be like the new over so well that was present i take the
[26:47.800 --> 26:53.880]  opportunity of wishing the east european cities well in the coming of the very early skiing season
[26:53.880 --> 26:59.960]  uh and snow and ice that's come there what of course is indicative of the fact that as independent
[26:59.960 --> 27:05.640]  science has now confirmed that the globe is actually cooling and has been cooling since 2002
[27:05.640 --> 27:12.600]  broadly flat since 1998 so we're all talking about something here which isn't happening
[27:12.600 --> 27:17.880]  i've heard time and time again members here talk as co2 as a pollutant a pollutant is a
[27:17.880 --> 27:22.440]  life-giving natural gas it gives me the impression that some of our members haven't had the benefit
[27:22.440 --> 27:29.640]  of a formal education isn't this really just about the state being able to get its hand in
[27:29.640 --> 27:36.120]  ordinary people's trouser pocket to steal get more tax from them isn't this all about political
[27:36.120 --> 27:43.960]  control isn't all this about politics and big business the whole thing's a sham this bogus
[27:43.960 --> 27:50.840]  hypothesis this ridiculous nonsense that man made co2 is causing global warming enough please
[27:50.840 --> 27:58.040]  before we damage irrevocably the global economy there you go that's the truth and now we're
[27:58.040 --> 28:02.680]  living in the artificial power outages that they ordered the power plant shut down and then go oh
[28:02.680 --> 28:06.840]  my gosh we don't know why there's no power you can't take showers small businesses the german
[28:06.840 --> 28:10.840]  head of their economic bureau said just aren't gonna exist anymore but big ones will get power
[28:10.840 --> 28:19.800]  cold-blooded naked feudalism cold-blooded naked siege against the people of this planet
[28:20.920 --> 28:25.640]  and you knew what happened universities across europe and the u.s are now saying no flu shot
[28:27.080 --> 28:28.920]  no school no flu shot

[33:21.400 --> 33:33.240]  live from freedom command central it's the alex jones show
[33:33.240 --> 33:39.080]  you
[33:47.320 --> 33:51.720]  you know we talk a lot about the different ways the globalists are bringers of death
[33:52.680 --> 33:57.320]  ways they are depopulating us the way they're shutting the food off the way they're shutting
[33:57.320 --> 34:00.920]  the resources off the way they're devouring the currencies employing the borders and then
[34:00.920 --> 34:07.720]  setting up a police state and then defunding the police so they get full total control over them so
[34:07.720 --> 34:15.240]  they'll bow while crime rates in some u.s. cities are up 200 percent crime on average is up over 50
[34:15.240 --> 34:23.480]  percent in just the last 20 months since joe biden got into office think about that and they've
[34:23.480 --> 34:27.800]  ordered for the fbi systems down to the local levels they get grants so they they they can
[34:27.800 --> 34:33.000]  ply with the fbi statistical analysis to not report crime like they did before so you better
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.680]  believe just like on the veirs one out of a hundred people that died from the shot they
[34:36.680 --> 34:41.720]  estimate it gets reported so it's easily a hundred times some say 50 times the point is
[34:41.720 --> 34:47.160]  it's way higher so when you're here in portland had a 200 percent increase in crime ladies and
[34:47.160 --> 34:51.880]  gentlemen it's incredible it's much higher in your hearing and by the way i love black people
[34:52.600 --> 34:57.480]  i love white people i love brown people i love people there are such wonderful black people
[34:57.480 --> 35:02.680]  such wonderful white people claus wab is a really evil horrible white person prince charles is a
[35:02.680 --> 35:11.240]  really evil horrible black person white person but you've got racial attacks going on around the
[35:11.240 --> 35:19.160]  us that used to be 10 to 1 black on white now it's 21 or higher and every day a white man a white
[35:19.160 --> 35:25.560]  woman a white child is kidnapped raped tortured and murdered by crazy racist black people and i
[35:25.560 --> 35:29.560]  got a bunch of cases of it today we'll be getting to a little bit later and i hate covering this
[35:29.560 --> 35:36.680]  stuff but the media isolates it and suppresses it and then when a crazy white person and they're
[35:36.680 --> 35:42.920]  out there a bad white person goes out there and does something evil man it is the top story
[35:42.920 --> 35:47.880]  everywhere and every white person is guilty every white person is to blame collectively
[35:47.880 --> 35:52.680]  like there's a mass shooting every gun owners to blame when that's horse crapper when a muslim
[35:52.680 --> 35:58.040]  runs over somebody you know 20 people in the car or a hundred people in the case of nice france
[35:58.760 --> 36:01.880]  you don't blame the bus you don't blame the truck you blame who did it but they try to
[36:01.880 --> 36:08.120]  suppress when the islamics do that so it's open season on white people by the ruling globalist
[36:08.120 --> 36:14.520]  white new world order because they want to solve killing each other but i have case after case like
[36:14.520 --> 36:20.360]  this crazy new shooting in itlana i don't want to air the video the guy running around just
[36:20.360 --> 36:28.680]  randomly shooting women and you name it and then smiling when he gets arrested
[36:30.760 --> 36:35.480]  and is so proud of all the people he just shot he'd been let out by george soros da
[36:36.200 --> 36:40.120]  after a bunch of crimes he committed then you have this individual in tennessee
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.120]  that kidnapped the poor white lady teacher i don't care if she's black or white she's a human being
[36:46.120 --> 36:49.720]  took her raped her and tortured her to death and because he's black on white they're suppressing
[36:49.720 --> 36:54.360]  the story can you imagine if a white dude kidnapped a black woman and went and raped and
[36:54.360 --> 37:00.440]  murder it'd be on every channel everywhere and all whites will be to blame so that is this division
[37:00.440 --> 37:06.040]  they're pushing and the truth is the real persecution in this country is the unborn
[37:08.200 --> 37:16.440]  and it's the exploitation of migrants and it is the murder and torture and killing of white people
[37:16.440 --> 37:21.320]  because the media is out there and all these movies and all these tv shows saying that white
[37:21.320 --> 37:25.560]  people are inherently bad white people are inherently evil and they deserve a die so some
[37:25.560 --> 37:34.200]  sweet little school teacher gets grabbed at gunpoint in memphis that will play her singing to her
[37:34.200 --> 37:40.600]  tennagarden students in a minute and she gets raped and murdered and that's okay and the media
[37:40.600 --> 37:46.040]  suppresses the story it's disgusting and when they question these guys they say well she's a
[37:46.040 --> 37:51.080]  white person she deserves it and i could play you the new black panther party all day long in
[37:51.080 --> 37:57.560]  houston and in chicago and in oakland i got all the clips i'll have these guys on before saying

[38:02.920 --> 38:08.840]  anybody but this is how they're playing us off against each other and it's disgusting because
[38:08.840 --> 38:13.400]  it's destructive and it's what the left ones and they think black people are stupid and they are
[38:13.400 --> 38:18.040]  trying to weaponize black people and there's already a race war going on against white people
[38:18.040 --> 38:21.480]  and we've got to be smart enough to protect ourselves no matter what color we are but to see
[38:21.480 --> 38:26.840]  through this and understand what this is white people aren't evil black people aren't evil but
[38:26.840 --> 38:33.240]  there are evil and easily controlled manipulative individuals like these monsters whether they
[38:33.240 --> 38:39.080]  be black or white but it's 21 black on white right now and it's really bad and it's out of control
[38:39.080 --> 38:44.520]  because they brainwashed some black males to believe that white people actually are the reason
[38:44.520 --> 38:50.520]  their life's not good so it's somehow moral to do this type of crap unbelievable here's a clip
[38:50.520 --> 38:57.160]  boiling down some of the latest crime statistics nearly 30 years crime was falling in the united
[38:57.160 --> 39:12.360]  states no more the national murder rate is at its highest in 25 years the result of far left
[39:12.360 --> 39:18.440]  policies that leave innocent americans at the mercy of violent criminals you've seen the images

[39:25.240 --> 39:30.040]  elderly women viciously beaten on the street and outside their homes

[39:51.800 --> 39:57.560]  before trial woke far left politicians have allowed our streets and parks to be overrun with crime
[39:57.560 --> 40:05.000]  and drugs police have been made into the enemy criminals into a protected class violent crimes

[40:14.680 --> 40:22.280]  percent in portland cities and chaos billions in property damages lives families destroyed

[47:13.720 --> 47:19.640]  all right i got a lot of other big world news to cover and two huge deaths coming up and there's
[47:19.640 --> 47:26.600]  also several new reports that the great harris the smith and his team have put together one of
[47:26.600 --> 47:31.720]  his titled if i worked at cnn this is going to premiere here at the start of the next hour
[47:31.720 --> 47:37.080]  that andrew torbizon and so much more but uh rob one of the producers who just so happens to be black
[47:37.720 --> 47:43.480]  came in here and reminded me of a great report he did in june titled the brainwashing of white
[47:43.480 --> 47:48.040]  supremacy and again folks they're setting us all up we're all being targeted for lawlessness
[47:48.040 --> 47:54.600]  and collapse and by these major cities literally these da's that soros puts in letting black people
[47:54.600 --> 48:00.760]  specifically commit crimes specifically i mean i'm talking murder you name it i showed you the
[48:00.760 --> 48:07.480]  illinois law where you can be released for second degree murder after one day in jail i know that
[48:07.480 --> 48:13.720]  doesn't sound real it's real i mean the safety act so none of this seems real because it's
[48:13.720 --> 48:18.280]  tyranny and it's a total plan to bring things down so since he mentioned it uh let's go to
[48:18.280 --> 48:24.120]  this uh report that will repost on the front page of info wars dot com the brainwashing of white
[48:24.120 --> 48:42.120]  supremacy it's all a game a huge huge terrible bloody game okay uh of course it would make white
[48:42.120 --> 48:50.840]  people angry of course why because the pigmentation of their skin determines their destiny excuse me
[48:50.840 --> 49:01.000]  that is insane on one hand but on the other hand it's a part of a plan if you keep pounding people
[49:01.000 --> 49:08.520]  and pushing people okay i'm not saying that there is no racism in this country of course but it's
[49:08.520 --> 49:15.960]  not just in this country and it's not just on one side it is in many countries all over the world
[49:15.960 --> 49:25.720]  by the way including communist china i'm not anti chinese but i am anti tyranny i am anti
[49:25.720 --> 49:35.160]  the propaganda that we get that passes for so called uh news it's not new it's propaganda and
[49:35.160 --> 49:45.320]  there's a big big difference so i think all of us need to grow the freak up stand up and understand
[49:45.320 --> 49:53.240]  once we understand there's very little they can do i'll say the most effective way to control people
[49:53.240 --> 49:59.880]  is to what control their minds control how they think make sure that they really don't
[49:59.880 --> 50:16.840]  critically think make sure that they're robots to be robotic
[50:16.840 --> 50:24.200]  and it's about community immunity i'm talking unity for you and me if top says it's good to
[50:24.200 --> 50:31.160]  trust me it's good now let's walk in the vaccine you see this victim mentality is nothing more than
[50:31.160 --> 50:39.960]  a uh deliberate slave mentality oh i'm a slave i can't do nothing i'm a slave i gotta depend on
[50:39.960 --> 50:47.800]  big brother that's insane and it's unacceptable you're not a slave and as we used to say back in
[50:47.800 --> 50:55.160]  the day in the original black panther party not this is so-called new black panther nonsense but
[50:55.160 --> 51:04.040]  in the original party formed in oakland california 1966 we said all power to the people black white
[51:04.040 --> 51:12.200]  brown red yellow okay our people i hear these fools on tv talking about defund the police and
[51:12.200 --> 51:18.120]  things like that we need police reform and prison reform and things like that because you know who
[51:18.120 --> 51:25.080]  ain't gonna defund the cops white neighborhood and rich neighborhoods so that notion they keep
[51:25.080 --> 51:29.400]  saying that i'm like wait a minute we're just gonna leave who are black people supposed to call
[51:29.400 --> 51:35.560]  ghostbusters when we have crime in our neighborhoods we need police reform like i say white people
[51:35.560 --> 51:40.600]  especially rich white people they're always gonna have cops so we need to stop that defund or
[51:40.600 --> 51:48.440]  embodge the cops crap this country is doomed it is doomed not just because of african americans
[51:48.440 --> 51:59.160]  but because by 2014 this country is going to be minority white european hear me minority white
[51:59.160 --> 52:05.320]  european and you guys are gonna have to start working more with hispanics who'll make up a

[52:26.360 --> 52:32.680]  cities where we start having a whole organic movement that was given to us so let's give the
[52:32.680 --> 52:41.960]  people that we control will provide them with leaders in all of this pressure and yes that's

[1:00:04.520 --> 1:00:11.000]  ahead but i'm not concerned about that now i just want to do god's will
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:23.160]  and he's allowed me to go up to the mountain and i've looked over and i've seen the promise land
[1:00:24.760 --> 1:00:33.800]  i may not get that with you but i want you to know tonight we as a people will get to the promise land
[1:00:35.400 --> 1:00:40.600]  we gotta come together whether you believe it or not you gotta decide whether you have dominion
[1:00:40.600 --> 1:00:46.280]  over yourself i believe that the majority of the plain people of the united states will day in and
[1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:52.520]  day out make fewer mistakes in governing themselves and any smaller class or body of men no matter
[1:00:52.520 --> 1:00:56.680]  what they're creating will make in trying to govern them and you gotta decide whether it's
[1:00:56.680 --> 1:01:02.120]  god that's gonna have dominion over you that you get orders from or whether some other human
[1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:06.840]  that's jacked into the evil force is gonna have dominion over you what we're talking about now
[1:01:06.840 --> 1:01:14.440]  is like a second industrial revolution but the product this time will not be textiles or machines
[1:01:14.440 --> 1:01:20.600]  or vehicles or even weapons the product this time will be humans themselves do we want to have a human
[1:01:20.600 --> 1:01:25.960]  plan or a post-human plan no vol harari and claus schwaab and bill gates say humans are obsolete
[1:01:25.960 --> 1:01:32.440]  we're scum because they know we are their competition they know that if we go for what we want and what
[1:01:32.440 --> 1:01:37.240]  god wants to have they can't compete with that transmission they can't compete with that blueprint
[1:01:37.240 --> 1:01:43.480]  they can't compete without architecture they can't compete with that master plan but i just see it now
[1:01:43.480 --> 1:01:49.640]  it'll be so clear soon are you pro-human or are you anti-human you are the human resistance to this
[1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:56.040]  alien takeover and again when i say alien takeover i don't mean some little tinfoil flying saucer
[1:01:56.040 --> 1:02:02.520]  crashing and roswell from alphas and turries i'm talking about the transmission in the universe of
[1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:09.800]  god's order and god's will or do you choose to serve the agents of death and like martin
[1:02:09.800 --> 1:02:13.960]  lucer king said we're not going to judge them off what color they are we're going to judge them off
[1:02:13.960 --> 1:02:21.080]  of their character of their actions and deeds so i'm going to say it right now real clear i love
[1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:26.520]  everybody no matter what color your beautiful skin is what i care about your heart and your guts in
[1:02:26.520 --> 1:02:31.640]  your mind and you're under attack by these satanists and they want to kill you and they want to kill
[1:02:31.640 --> 1:02:37.800]  your children and i say we set our differences aside and i say we come together and we beat
[1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:43.880]  these people and we smash their technocracy and we build the future together and we can do anything
[1:02:43.880 --> 1:02:49.080]  with our real diversity these enemies tell us all day about diversity they mean divided and
[1:02:49.080 --> 1:02:55.800]  conquered groups of people separate from each other this bill is supported by all of the democrats
[1:02:55.800 --> 1:03:06.040]  house and senate it's just the filibuster in a way so in a way if you really truly want to honor
[1:03:06.040 --> 1:03:14.760]  dr king don't dishonor him by using a congressional custom as an excuse for protecting our democracy
[1:03:14.760 --> 1:03:19.800]  but i tell me if you have a problem figuring out whether you're from me or trump and you ain't black
[1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:28.920]  i want unity under a code of freedom and liberty and justice and and coming together and working
[1:03:28.920 --> 1:03:36.120]  together and being strong and that's what info wars is and that's why the enemies of humanity hate
[1:03:36.120 --> 1:03:46.280]  us so much because we love god and god loves humanity and i am a human supremacist i am
[1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:57.080]  a human supremacist i am a human supremacist i am a human supremacist i am a human supremacist
[1:03:57.080 --> 1:04:02.920]  that term will be the future war with the robots and the ai what you're hearing now is the entire
[1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:08.440]  future and everything they try to stop us from doing our supremacy will not end with this planet
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:15.880]  we will keep all the stars we will colonize we will green get worlds we will go interdimensional
[1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:19.880]  we will unlock the secrecy universe god has laid them out like christmas presents for his
[1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:26.040]  children and i am extremely honored to be in the fulcrum and the heart of the fight to bring our
[1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:34.120]  race the human race in a race for the future and we will break the enemy we'll break the
[1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:41.640]  pedophiles we will break the satanist because god already sent his own self down here to show us
[1:04:41.640 --> 1:04:47.080]  he could do it god would never ask us to go through an optional course he wouldn't go through and
[1:04:47.080 --> 1:04:51.080]  now we're gonna go through what christ did and we're gonna go through it and we're gonna be
[1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:57.800]  destroyed but reborn on the other side

[1:13:23.080 --> 1:13:30.280]  he likes other men i hate him because he's all part of this new ruling class where you have to
[1:13:30.280 --> 1:13:36.360]  either be a woman or be a homosexual totally positions of power and then biden's monkey
[1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:41.000]  pox are constantly dresses up and is involved in satanic activities according to himself
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:45.720]  and a bunch of other really gross stuff i'm not going to say on air but i started investigating
[1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:49.960]  it last night when the story broke yesterday and i quit investigating very quickly because i
[1:13:49.960 --> 1:13:54.680]  didn't want to go down that rabbit hole but in the satanism into some really destructive stuff
[1:13:55.320 --> 1:13:59.400]  really hurtful things to his own body and he's part of the course
[1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:08.440]  dr demetri dazakalus the director of joe bides national monkey pox response team held his first
[1:14:08.440 --> 1:14:14.200]  press conference wednesday but attention online focused on the generic photos of him in the past
[1:14:14.200 --> 1:14:19.640]  and again for a family audience we're not going to show you this stuff but um he's into things
[1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:27.240]  like eating poop and here he is why are we surprised with a big pentagram and hailing satan
[1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:35.880]  so what a god to follow eat that poop so delicious and i thought my dog was bad doing it so
[1:14:35.880 --> 1:14:41.560]  that's where we are we're not going to show you uh any more of that ladies and gentlemen but skulls
[1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:48.040]  and and and pentagrams all over his body what a nice person and remember he's part of the course
[1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:52.760]  the uh these guys call themselves women like the head of the nuclear waste program he says a woman
[1:14:52.760 --> 1:14:58.280]  looks like a space alien remember the head of the nuclear waste program this is the new woman
[1:14:58.280 --> 1:15:04.280]  out of so much they hate women oh men are women now and this is what a woman looks like and of
[1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:12.040]  course he's on websites promoting underage sex with children isn't that surprising i'm just completely
[1:15:12.040 --> 1:15:18.440]  blown away that he dresses up like count Dracula but look at him here
[1:15:19.400 --> 1:15:26.840]  undermine women undermine men say that women are degenerate gross men say that men are degenerate
[1:15:26.840 --> 1:15:33.400]  gross creatures jack sprat could eat no fat his wife could eat no lean between the two

[1:17:06.920 --> 1:17:11.960]  communists well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above
[1:17:11.960 --> 1:17:17.160]  organic in the volcanic soil better than watermelon coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers
[1:17:17.160 --> 1:17:20.520]  that you know the media calls communists but really they're just a commune and whatever the
[1:17:20.520 --> 1:17:24.600]  point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government
[1:17:24.600 --> 1:17:28.440]  take over so i actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and i've been buying it for what 14 years
[1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:32.360]  and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50
[1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:36.280]  percent more per pound and i just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere

[1:19:38.760 --> 1:19:42.760]  really making that connection to god that we can truly empower ourselves that's why the
[1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:48.200]  globals bombard us with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals

[1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:41.240]  our country was founded in defiance of these people and in fairness to her she's from a german
[1:21:41.240 --> 1:21:46.440]  transylvanian bloodline she's like ten percent old british bloodline it's just disgusting to
[1:21:46.440 --> 1:21:50.440]  sit there and watch these people and people worshiping people because they're bloodline
[1:21:50.440 --> 1:21:54.840]  that is not what freedom is all about it's not what america is all about okay let's go ahead
[1:21:54.840 --> 1:21:59.000]  and take phone calls like marlith king said it's what you stand for it's what you do we're going

[1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:11.560]  on any topic you want to discuss 877-789-2539 but right now we're joined by the great
[1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:21.000]  andrew torba of gab when there was mass shooting in a jewish center and the guy five minutes before
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:28.360]  he did it horrible guy he he put a post on gab saying he was about to do something bad
[1:22:29.320 --> 1:22:34.760]  andrew torba got blamed they tried to ban him he survived thanks sport every time there's a mass
[1:22:34.760 --> 1:22:39.160]  shooting anybody reports on it they're bad if they're alternative media but when facebook
[1:22:39.160 --> 1:22:42.920]  showed the mass shooting in atlanta that just happened oh well that's not their fault because
[1:22:42.920 --> 1:22:48.760]  it's not if i call a bomb thread in on my at&t cell phone it's not at&t's fault so andrew
[1:22:48.760 --> 1:22:53.480]  torba's here to talk about his book that's been in the top 10 and the top hundred consistently
[1:22:53.480 --> 1:22:58.440]  last month christian nationalism on amazon.com which is the new new york times book bestseller
[1:22:58.440 --> 1:23:04.120]  list because new york times rigs are less now my book has also been in the top 10 off and on
[1:23:04.120 --> 1:23:09.800]  and on more than 40 charts the top so is andrew's so he's been dominating the religious charts and
[1:23:09.800 --> 1:23:14.280]  the cultural charts we've been dominating the political science and history charts
[1:23:14.280 --> 1:23:19.160]  and politics charts and of course the number one charts as well so it shows how popular
[1:23:19.160 --> 1:23:25.400]  freedom is to talk about his book and so much more is andrew torba another survivor in the
[1:23:25.400 --> 1:23:30.040]  ranks with andrew tate and others andrew great to have you here with us pleasure to be here as
[1:23:30.040 --> 1:23:36.600]  always alex we've been busy building was working on this book you and i are both in the top 100
[1:23:36.600 --> 1:23:41.480]  on amazon's bestseller list right now our book actually comes out tomorrow so we've been doing
[1:23:41.480 --> 1:23:46.360]  this through preorders and like you said it just shows how popular these ideas are and it shows
[1:23:46.360 --> 1:23:50.680]  how big our movement is i think one of the things that the enemy wants us to believe is that we're
[1:23:50.680 --> 1:23:55.800]  isolated or that we're alone or that you know the people that share our values in our worldview
[1:23:55.800 --> 1:24:01.000]  are are very small in number but that's actually the opposite is true we make up you know 80 to 90
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:07.240]  percent of this country and the elites in dc and in silicon valley and uh in new york city they make
[1:24:07.240 --> 1:24:11.880]  up the small percentage of people that are running this country right now and their worldview and their
[1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:17.000]  values are diametrically opposed to us and what we saw happening before we wrote this book was
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:22.360]  they were trying to subvert this term christian nationalism uh what does christian nationalism
[1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:26.760]  means well it means you're a christian and it means that you're a nationalist what is a nationalist
[1:24:26.760 --> 1:24:31.240]  it's someone who loves their neighbor it's someone who loves their country so you know being a christian
[1:24:31.240 --> 1:24:36.120]  nationalist is not a bad thing in fact you know during our research of this book what we found is
[1:24:36.120 --> 1:24:42.440]  that prior to the founding of this country in 1776 there were explicitly christian countries for the
[1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:48.440]  first 200 years with the early colonies i mean some of our early states uh virginia for example
[1:24:48.440 --> 1:24:55.000]  had a state religion of anglicanism from 1606 to 1830 uh massachusetts new york new hampshire
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:25:00.760]  north carolina all of the early colonies had explicitly christian state religions um you
[1:25:00.760 --> 1:25:05.480]  know so that the founding the true founding of this country is explicitly christian and that
[1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:10.680]  goes into the founding fathers you know the constitution the bill of rights all of these
[1:25:10.680 --> 1:25:16.840]  things were drafted based on a christian worldview and we cannot let them erase our history we cannot
[1:25:16.840 --> 1:25:21.960]  let them rewrite our history we cannot let them demonize us as christians we have to fight to
[1:25:21.960 --> 1:25:26.680]  protect our worldview and you know a lot of people are miss misinterpreting christian nationalism
[1:25:26.680 --> 1:25:33.480]  as a purely political movement it's not it's actually a spiritual cultural uh and political
[1:25:33.480 --> 1:25:38.840]  movement so it's all these things in one and well let me 100 let me 100 agree with you for
[1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:44.840]  historical research and just common sense you are called a white supremacist in the national news
[1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:51.080]  which is total crap because you call for christian nationalism as if christianity is a white
[1:25:51.080 --> 1:25:57.000]  supremacist it's it's all about unifying humanity under christ and his father god and and our family
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:02.680]  together and we are the bride christ is the groom we we marry all of us together into one christian
[1:26:02.680 --> 1:26:08.680]  family to unify and create peace and justice african countries that are christian are incredibly
[1:26:08.680 --> 1:26:13.720]  prosperous those that aren't collapsed same thing around the world christianity took europe from
[1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:20.440]  literal barbarism living in caves and huts like africans to creating spaceships and quantum mechanics
[1:26:20.440 --> 1:26:25.240]  and and and the christian areas of africa look at rwanda 10 percent were christian they had all
[1:26:25.240 --> 1:26:30.120]  the wealth all the money all the science iqs as high as europeans incredible scientists because
[1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:34.840]  they weren't running around head hunting once they got christ boom they were awesome same thing
[1:26:34.840 --> 1:26:38.440]  with white people white people were running around eating each other uh you know just a few
[1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:44.680]  thousand years ago before christianity so let's the answer is jesus is what you're saying unequivocally
[1:26:44.680 --> 1:26:49.480]  yes i mean christianity is not a racial supremacist movement it's also not you know there's not a
[1:26:49.480 --> 1:26:54.040]  geographic central location outside of the kingdom of heaven i think you know what one of the ways
[1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:58.120]  that the enemy is is sort of framing this is there they're calling it white christian nationalism
[1:26:58.120 --> 1:27:01.880]  and they're trying to say that only white people can be christians which is totally absurd on its
[1:27:01.880 --> 1:27:07.240]  face you know the bible tells us there is neither jew nor greek we are all united as one in jesus christ
[1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:11.880]  in our shared faith as brothers and sisters in christ and and that's the globalist because
[1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:16.520]  their whole thing is a cult under their b system so that there there's the satanic system and there's
[1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:20.280]  the christian system and the whole u n world government's targeting christianity that tells
[1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:25.240]  us how powerful and real it is well alex it's it's ultimately i don't have to tell you this
[1:27:25.240 --> 1:27:29.960]  you know they have a religion their religion is transhumanism they want to transcend humanity so
[1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:35.000]  you know that the religion of christianity is the the pro-human movement right it's the pro-human
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:39.960]  world view it's the pro-humanity world view these people themselves is the pro god world view obviously
[1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:45.160]  these people want to become gods they want to transcend humanity and become gods and they are
[1:27:45.160 --> 1:27:51.080]  anti-human they are anti god they are anti christ and we are presenting an alternative that is the
[1:27:51.080 --> 1:27:56.440]  tried and true alternative that made the western society the entire west what it is it made europe
[1:27:56.440 --> 1:28:00.200]  what it is it made america what it is and that is christianity and that is our shared faith and
[1:28:00.200 --> 1:28:04.920]  belief in jesus christ and that's what our book is about it's about returning to that it's about
[1:28:04.920 --> 1:28:11.320]  understanding the historical uh bedrock of of of our nation uh is grounded in christianity
[1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:15.400]  and it's about waking christians up because i think a lot of a lot of christians are just
[1:28:15.400 --> 1:28:21.400]  you know sleep walking through history right now and they refuse to get engaged in in public discourse
[1:28:21.400 --> 1:28:26.520]  and that's right they don't realize that the churches today are 501c3 and bought off christianity
[1:28:26.520 --> 1:28:32.680]  was a religious spiritual movement that politically took over and yeah we let people practice their
[1:28:32.680 --> 1:28:36.680]  own religion we don't make them convert we're not islam but we're christian and that's what this
[1:28:36.680 --> 1:28:41.960]  country is that's right and we need to be christians all the time not you know not just in church but
[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:45.720]  all day every day and that's that's what we're trying to convey in this book powerful can't
[1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:50.440]  wait to read the book andretorbo stay there let's talk about what christian nationalism means and
[1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:54.920]  how it's the antidote to satanism it becomes so much clearer every day the democrats are satanist

[1:34:45.480 --> 1:34:51.320]  tyranny and defending our families that's what i want not to go be part of the establishment or
[1:34:51.320 --> 1:34:57.800]  you know go to white tie events everybody kiss your ass so andrew torbis andrew torbis and the new
[1:35:00.280 --> 1:35:05.400]  say that again you're popping in my head the queen died okay i told them to tell me when the
[1:35:05.960 --> 1:35:11.560]  queen died let's put that on screen her royal majesty you see drive report right there let's
[1:35:11.560 --> 1:35:19.320]  click on it big siren there her royal majesty her husband died what a year ago prince philip the
[1:35:19.320 --> 1:35:26.600]  former co-head of the bilderberg group with prince bernhardt and the queen of england has made the
[1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:36.440]  jump into hyperspace and it's now bye bye time her uncle was the top nazi edward the eighth who
[1:35:36.440 --> 1:35:41.800]  was the king of england was going to serve hitler of the european union uh but they chose to uh be
[1:35:41.800 --> 1:35:49.960]  anti-hitler and her husband prince philip said he wanted to come back as a particularly deadly virus
[1:35:49.960 --> 1:35:59.640]  and be reincarnated to contribute to depopulation and i just hope that he didn't get his wish i hope
[1:35:59.640 --> 1:36:07.320]  because i love the queen so much i hope prince philip didn't kill the queen that's really what i'm
[1:36:07.320 --> 1:36:13.560]  hoping right now but i would that be a turn of fate that he was reincarnated as a particularly
[1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:19.000]  deadly virus guys pull the quote up prince philip on reincarnated as a deadly virus he told the
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:25.640]  autobahn society that he told deutch agon tour that and he told reuters that there's three interviews
[1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:33.800]  where he said he wanted to come back as a virus to lower population i hope because he said he
[1:36:33.800 --> 1:36:41.560]  wanted to come back and kill people that's his wish not mine i hope that prince philip didn't get his
[1:36:41.560 --> 1:36:51.000]  wish so back to andrew torba andrew do you have anything to say about the queen queen elizabeth
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:56.120]  the second making the jump into hyperspace i hope she knew jesus christ is her lord and savior
[1:36:56.120 --> 1:37:00.760]  that's what i'll say you know it's um it's unfortunate there's there's so much going on now
[1:37:00.760 --> 1:37:07.320]  um but she lived a pretty long life um and you know again i just hope that she knew jesus christ
[1:37:07.320 --> 1:37:11.640]  is her lord and savior that's the most important decision that you can make in your life and uh
[1:37:11.640 --> 1:37:16.680]  it's it's a decision that i hope a lot of people are taking seriously now um there's so much fear
[1:37:16.680 --> 1:37:22.280]  in our world there's there's so much uncertainty um you know this this biden speech trying to
[1:37:22.280 --> 1:37:28.200]  categorize you know 81 million people as as extremists for daring to dissent against the status
[1:37:28.200 --> 1:37:33.000]  quo of the mainstream uh but we have to remember again that we're not alone in that uh you know
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  our worldview and that our our belief and our faith um has stood the test of time and christians
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:44.680]  have faced persecution for you know thousands of years since uh since christ ascended into heaven
[1:37:44.680 --> 1:37:48.520]  and it's it's something that we're going to continue to face but we have to push through we have to
[1:37:48.520 --> 1:37:53.800]  keep the faith and and we have to have our faith stronger now than than ever before no i totally
[1:37:53.800 --> 1:38:02.600]  agree with you of course the big question is will it be prince edward that becomes the new king
[1:38:03.960 --> 1:38:11.640]  or will he not be bypassed or or will it go to prince charles because i mean prince charles is
[1:38:11.640 --> 1:38:17.480]  mr reset new world order world government i'm predicting right now they're not going to bypass
[1:38:18.680 --> 1:38:23.400]  prince charles i'm making a prediction right now i may be wrong but i think prince charles
[1:38:23.400 --> 1:38:27.160]  is going to be seated as the king of england he'll say something like for two years while his
[1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:32.040]  son gets ready i predict prince charles will be seated as the king of england and will fly the
[1:38:32.040 --> 1:38:40.920]  dragon flag against humanity yeah we'll have to see i mean you know there's so much in motion
[1:38:40.920 --> 1:38:45.400]  right now it's sort of like we're it feels like we're transitioning right we're transitioning
[1:38:45.400 --> 1:38:50.840]  into sort of a new age and um the old power structures are sort of going away and and new
[1:38:50.840 --> 1:38:55.080]  power structures are coming in with this world economic forum i mean everything that you you
[1:38:55.080 --> 1:38:59.160]  talk about in your book right uh you know it's so we have to be prepared and we have to know our
[1:38:59.160 --> 1:39:02.920]  enemy and the big thing that i've been talking about and i know that you've been covering for
[1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:08.520]  years as well as is transhumanism because again you know they do want to reduce the population
[1:39:08.520 --> 1:39:13.320]  and they do want to become gods by transcending our human biology i think it's so important to
[1:39:13.320 --> 1:39:22.760]  be talking about this stuff well ding dong you know that song from uh wizard of oz from the house
[1:39:22.760 --> 1:39:32.360]  lands on the witch yes yes how's it go ding dong the witch is dead the witch oh witch the witch
[1:39:32.360 --> 1:39:38.680]  oh witch ding dong the wicked witch is dead and i'm not saying she was a wicked witch her husband
[1:39:38.680 --> 1:39:44.520]  though was definitely a depopulationist and a bad guy what do you think right yeah yeah absolutely
[1:39:44.520 --> 1:39:48.200]  i mean that quote i mean that's been widely circulated for a while i mean this is what they
[1:39:48.200 --> 1:39:53.160]  all believe this is what bill gates believes uh you know this is what uh all the transhumanists
[1:39:53.160 --> 1:39:58.840]  believe they they want to reduce the the size of the population and they want to become gods they
[1:39:58.840 --> 1:40:04.360]  want to transcend human biology to become gods and um you know that we have to present their
[1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:09.880]  worldview as it is and we have to present our counter worldview as the solution to that which
[1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:15.560]  is we are pro god we don't want to become gods ourselves we are pro humanity we are pro life
[1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:20.360]  and you know that's that's that's the way forward is we have to remind people of that we have to
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:24.360]  remind people of who we are and what we believe and what our worldviews are and and that's what
[1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:27.480]  we're trying to do here with with our book and i know that's what you're trying to do with your
[1:40:27.480 --> 1:40:32.280]  book as well as expose how these people think and what their plans are well you're one of the

[1:45:05.480 --> 1:45:10.440]  chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're doing that not because we're weak but
[1:45:10.440 --> 1:45:16.600]  because we're made the image of god the creator and we are powerful and the social engineers
[1:45:16.600 --> 1:45:22.040]  fear that so much so that's why i repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first
[1:45:22.040 --> 1:45:30.920]  came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was
[1:45:30.920 --> 1:45:35.960]  hopeless they need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[1:45:35.960 --> 1:45:43.240]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world
[1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:47.800]  who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more
[1:45:47.800 --> 1:45:52.920]  than ever because even you don't believe in god both the globalists are manifesting and setting up
[1:45:52.920 --> 1:45:57.720]  is safe and and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just
[1:45:57.720 --> 1:46:04.840]  announced we are now living in the void sliding towards collapse in the strange space between
[1:46:04.840 --> 1:46:12.520]  what we've known and what's to come and right now the most important thing to remember is don't panic
[1:46:12.520 --> 1:46:18.840]  stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe
[1:46:18.840 --> 1:46:25.720]  sound course there is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building our
[1:46:25.720 --> 1:46:32.760]  own society all we got to do is survive the crash and right now we still have time to prepare the
[1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:40.120]  world fiat currency system is racing towards zero it's time to convert it into hard assets now

[1:47:42.680 --> 1:47:48.360]  some people are celebrating man Elizabeth the second dying but it's now being reported as i told you
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:57.640]  as i predicted king charles the third of the sex coberg dynasty ladies and gentlemen will be the king
[1:47:57.640 --> 1:48:02.200]  of england he wants world government a military operation to cut off carbon and starve to death
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:18.440]  so if you thought queen elizabeth was bad prepare yourself prepare yourself
[1:48:43.480 --> 1:48:53.560]  as co-owner i must suffer i thoroughly examined her and she's not only merely dead she's really
[1:48:53.560 --> 1:49:03.640]  most easily dead and this is a day of independence for all the munchkins and their descendants
[1:49:03.640 --> 1:49:09.160]  if any yes let the joyous news be spread so we can all wish that last is dead
[1:49:13.640 --> 1:49:17.560]  but here comes prince charles the third now king of england
[1:49:17.560 --> 1:49:29.240]  ah the throne prince is now king Dracula of the house of the dragon when they fly the dragon
[1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:51.320]  flag it means no quarter but annihilation and death on a planetary scale
[1:49:51.320 --> 1:49:55.400]  another fanfare i'm very sad the queen of england and i hope that she found jesus i don't think she's
[1:49:55.400 --> 1:50:00.840]  the wicked witch uh because compared to the rest of her family uh she was good in that best house
[1:50:00.840 --> 1:50:05.720]  in the bad neighborhood uh but the queen of england dead big deal everybody's going to worship it
[1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:10.760]  all these women followed disney and the whole princess cosmology and women think it's so cool
[1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:16.200]  and so neat it's disgusting the institution of royalty but that's my view i'm not a royalist
[1:50:16.200 --> 1:50:24.360]  i'm an american i'm a 1776er but that said everybody better get ready because we got king
[1:50:24.360 --> 1:50:30.840]  charles the third and his consort his handmaiden his
[1:50:34.520 --> 1:50:38.440]  what's the term they use for that his concubine
[1:50:41.160 --> 1:50:47.160]  that is jimmy savale on the new world order now we're gonna get to stare that down at this
[1:50:47.160 --> 1:50:51.880]  t-point with the powerful new world order and the british globalist empire that is at the heart
[1:50:51.880 --> 1:50:59.720]  of this entire system that we face ding dong but when i was talking about that i wasn't playing
[1:50:59.720 --> 1:51:03.800]  ding dong the witch is dead about queen elizabeth second i was talking about hillary clinton
[1:51:03.800 --> 1:51:08.840]  i forgot to mention this yesterday hillary has officially said she's not running for president
[1:51:08.840 --> 1:51:16.040]  for a third time in 2024 we put that on screen now that means she's gonna run because if she tells
[1:51:16.040 --> 1:51:21.240]  you she's not gonna run you know she's gonna run except she's got incredibly bad health problems
[1:51:21.240 --> 1:51:27.320]  the rest of it so maybe it's true her expiration date was up a long time ago but she's not just
[1:51:27.320 --> 1:51:36.440]  rotten milk she is like yogurt uh at this point so i never speak ill of the dead and i i'm i'm very
[1:51:36.440 --> 1:51:43.800]  sorry uh to everybody over in the uk for losing your queen and you know they demonize the nation
[1:51:43.800 --> 1:51:47.960]  state people think of the queen as the nation state and i don't even know how farage supports the
[1:51:47.960 --> 1:51:57.320]  monarchy and i know that uh some of our crew have been invited and hung around with the royals
[1:51:58.120 --> 1:52:03.080]  and so there's a certain thing about being invited to the palace and then you kind of get on board
[1:52:03.080 --> 1:52:08.520]  with them and believe in a royalist view but at the end of the day ladies and gentlemen the british
[1:52:08.520 --> 1:52:13.800]  royal family is not british they've run that whole country into the ground so you get a new prime
[1:52:13.800 --> 1:52:24.760]  minister we're told two days ago and within 48 hours the queen of england's dead big things going on
[1:52:25.480 --> 1:52:30.120]  but ding dong the witch is dead the witch oh witch the witch oh witch ding dong the witch
[1:52:30.120 --> 1:52:35.080]  kid witch is dead and i'm talking about hillary politically not violently i don't want any harm
[1:52:35.080 --> 1:52:41.240]  to come to hillary's head i'm saying politically she has announced her own demise and that her
[1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:50.440]  political career is dead as a coffin dead as a cemetery dead as a doornail dead as count Dracula
[1:52:51.880 --> 1:52:55.560]  dead as dead can get
[1:52:58.040 --> 1:53:01.160]  so we're going to continue to cover this as it unfolds
[1:53:03.480 --> 1:53:06.840]  you better believe as andrew twarba said
[1:53:06.840 --> 1:53:17.800]  this is all we're going to hear for the next month i mean john mccain was like a seven-day event
[1:53:17.800 --> 1:53:22.760]  george herbert walker bush like a two-week event of multiple funerals and trains and
[1:53:23.320 --> 1:53:29.560]  and just in oh my god the pop the circumstance it must be important to doing all this
[1:53:30.280 --> 1:53:34.440]  well the queen of england just found out that death is the great equalizer
[1:53:34.440 --> 1:53:39.400]  And that everybody's gonna face their creator and I hope she was right with Jesus
[1:53:40.720 --> 1:53:42.480]  Queen Elizabeth the second
[1:53:42.480 --> 1:53:45.420]  Britain's longest serving monarch has died
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:50.240]  The Queen's decline to sit Britain into chaos. It will get much worse. Yes
[1:53:51.080 --> 1:53:57.920]  It's not the energy cuts. It's not the great recent that did it. It's her decline. She was holding up the country
[1:53:58.920 --> 1:54:00.080]  and
[1:54:00.080 --> 1:54:04.120]  Pull almost a quarter of Democrats believe men can get pregnant
[1:54:04.960 --> 1:54:10.720]  Mental illness and anti-science and propaganda. Here's a democratic party that want to be all the fact-checkers and
[1:54:11.400 --> 1:54:13.400]  Pre-control what you can say and what you can do
[1:54:17.080 --> 1:54:21.440]  But they believe men can have babies that will say two women had babies in a prison
[1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:26.560]  Yes, two women had baby together and they sit there and gaslight us
[1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:33.000]  With this insane level of propaganda and we're supposed to just sit there and buy it and say, okay, you're the authority
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:36.880]  I'll do whatever you say just don't call me a white supremacist. This is all a giant
[1:54:37.400 --> 1:54:39.080]  disgusting joke and
[1:54:39.080 --> 1:54:42.560]  The New World Order and the Royals and all of them know they're coming down
[1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:48.640]  They know they're going down and that's why they're trying to bring down civilization with the great reset
[1:54:48.840 --> 1:54:52.200]  Because as health or skelter says let's come back in with that next segment
[1:54:52.200 --> 1:54:56.680]  Coming down fast, but I'm miles above you
[1:54:57.240 --> 1:55:01.760]  They don't care if they're coming down as long as they're still on top. I want everybody to be
[1:55:02.840 --> 1:55:08.640]  Growing and beautiful and free and amazing and hopefully I'll be carried along with that tide. They don't like that

[1:59:55.340 --> 2:00:08.660]  25 years ago Princess Diana's car crashed inside the Pont de la Alma tunnel in Paris, France
[2:00:08.980 --> 2:00:15.940]  Her lover Dottie Fayed died upon impact along with the driver and even though Diana survived
[2:00:15.980 --> 2:00:20.100]  It took about 40 minutes to get her from the car to the ambulance
[2:00:20.100 --> 2:00:27.300]  The official story was that they were trying to free her from the car, but several witnesses say that Diana was conscious and
[2:00:27.780 --> 2:00:32.740]  Unobstructed photographs show that the backseat of the car was undamaged and
[2:00:33.140 --> 2:00:39.580]  Witnesses were pleading with the police to open the door and help her once in the ambulance took about 40 minutes
[2:00:39.580 --> 2:00:46.740]  For them to choose a hospital and when they finally set off the ambulance drove at a snail's pace and made several stops
[2:00:46.740 --> 2:00:50.900]  Taking about 40 minutes to drive less than four miles
[2:00:51.700 --> 2:00:53.460]  Doctors were turned away
[2:00:53.460 --> 2:01:02.300]  Witnesses were stripped searched cameras were confiscated. No evidence was gathered. No blood samples were taken and by 3 a.m.
[2:01:02.500 --> 2:01:06.780]  The entire scene was sprayed down with high-pressure water hoses
[2:01:07.620 --> 2:01:12.780]  Mercedes wanted to study the wreckage to see why it failed so badly, but they were denied
[2:01:12.780 --> 2:01:19.860]  Diana's body was taken by the royal family who had her reproductive organs removed before burying her remains
[2:01:20.220 --> 2:01:28.340]  All 17 cameras along the route of the crash were mysteriously turned off and all radio police frequencies
[2:01:28.460 --> 2:01:29.900]  Went down
[2:01:29.900 --> 2:01:33.060]  Witnesses were assaulted and threatened and there was no investigation
[2:01:33.940 --> 2:01:36.660]  Not until the inquest 10 years later
[2:01:36.660 --> 2:01:44.780]  Which is when most people learned that Diana had penned a note in 1996 saying that someone was going to kill her in a car
[2:01:44.780 --> 2:01:49.140]  Accident this note was concealed for six years at the inquest
[2:01:49.500 --> 2:01:53.860]  Experts agreed that Diana would have survived if they had gotten her to a hospital
[2:01:54.060 --> 2:01:57.500]  But the blame was put upon a military style attack
[2:01:58.140 --> 2:02:05.860]  According to witnesses a group of motorcycles along with a white fiat Uno worked in concert to crash the car
[2:02:05.860 --> 2:02:12.020]  First with a blinding flash of light followed by an explosion from the front tire of the Mercedes
[2:02:12.580 --> 2:02:18.820]  During the inquest a former MI6 agent described being shown the very same plan in
[2:02:19.420 --> 2:02:23.820]  1992 for a possible MI6 assassination of Slobodan
[2:02:24.220 --> 2:02:28.260]  Milosevic and claimed it was MI6 who killed Diana
[2:02:28.700 --> 2:02:33.620]  Because of all this the inquest ended with the verdict of unlawful killing
[2:02:33.620 --> 2:02:37.380]  Blaming her death on the mysterious military hit squad
[2:02:37.740 --> 2:02:45.300]  But the mainstream media spun the entire thing to make it sound like it was the paparazzi that caused her to crash
[2:02:45.540 --> 2:02:52.140]  Which is demonstrably false and while there was no investigation into finding the members of this military hit squad
[2:02:52.380 --> 2:02:57.660]  Three years later the alleged driver of the white fiat who had ties to MI6
[2:02:57.660 --> 2:03:05.460]  Reportedly committed suicide after being found shot twice in the back of the head and burned inside of his car
[2:03:06.180 --> 2:03:14.380]  During the inquest many things were kept from the jury such as the fact that Diana's seat belt was found to be defective and
[2:03:14.780 --> 2:03:16.780]  Evidence of the car being sabotaged
[2:03:17.500 --> 2:03:20.140]  Interestingly these things would have brought more suspicion
[2:03:20.740 --> 2:03:22.380]  Towards Dottie's father
[2:03:22.380 --> 2:03:29.660]  Muhammad al-Fa'ed who after turning down repeated offers from the French government to provide security was solely responsible
[2:03:30.100 --> 2:03:37.180]  for Diana's security detail and at the last minute had them leave their security detail in front of the hotel as a
[2:03:37.260 --> 2:03:41.860]  Decoy and take a different car a car that was recently stolen
[2:03:42.460 --> 2:03:46.020]  Broken repaired and never checked by security
[2:03:46.460 --> 2:03:48.460]  Left with only one security guard
[2:03:48.460 --> 2:03:56.260]  They were also assigned a new driver. Henri Paul who had no chauffeur permit was tied to foreign intelligence services
[2:03:56.420 --> 2:04:01.860]  Was seen on camera signaling to someone just before setting off had received over
[2:04:02.180 --> 2:04:07.780]  50,000 francs the day of the crash and this was all under the watch of Muhammad al-Fa'ed
[2:04:08.060 --> 2:04:11.180]  Who was deeply connected to the intelligence community?
[2:04:11.180 --> 2:04:18.140]  He was business partners with one of Lee Harvey Oswald's handlers and represented the grandfather of Muhammad Atta
[2:04:18.700 --> 2:04:21.260]  But none of that was mentioned during the inquest
[2:04:21.740 --> 2:04:26.860]  Instead with the help of pop culture agents such as Howard Stern and Piers Morgan
[2:04:27.260 --> 2:04:34.460]  Muhammad al-Fa'ed has provided the world with the cover story that Diana was pregnant with Dottie's child and
[2:04:34.740 --> 2:04:37.620]  Prince Philip had her killed because he's racist
[2:04:37.620 --> 2:04:44.420]  Which seems like a strange cover story that is if you don't realize that the entire folks
[2:04:44.420 --> 2:04:45.940]  We're gonna go to break

[2:08:03.940 --> 2:08:09.780]  But she's dusty and Prince Charles is dusty too. He's old too. He's gonna have like a week at the crown
[2:08:09.780 --> 2:08:14.340]  And then yeah, well, there's no doubt that we're about to get a month of just weeping and wailing here
[2:08:15.660 --> 2:08:22.460]  Yeah, it's a lot but the Princess Diana complained about Britain selling hundreds of millions of landmines killing tens of thousands children
[2:08:22.460 --> 2:08:24.340]  She had to go bye-bye
[2:08:24.340 --> 2:08:29.460]  Yeah, I've been watching all these videos that are coming up on them and it's like damn you guys really have the receipts
[2:08:29.460 --> 2:08:36.220]  It's it's it's really crazy and she was so young and beautiful and everyone loved her and I didn't know she was pregnant with
[2:08:36.780 --> 2:08:40.260]  Dodie's kids. So it's exciting, but I'm so excited to be here
[2:08:40.780 --> 2:08:43.140]  Alex like you're such a huge inspiration to me
[2:08:43.380 --> 2:08:50.980]  Like I I'm one of the first comics who last summer when de Blasio put down the vaccine mandate for the passports
[2:08:50.980 --> 2:08:54.340]  And you know, I was like, I'm not gonna perform in any club
[2:08:54.340 --> 2:08:59.540]  That is forcing someone to get a vaccine or show proof of vaccine and I was like, that's it
[2:08:59.540 --> 2:09:01.220]  I like I perform in New York City, but I'm done
[2:09:01.220 --> 2:09:06.420]  I took a stand and honestly like you were one of the people who inspired me to do that and
[2:09:06.580 --> 2:09:11.740]  I got a lot of flak for it and then a few other comics came out and similarly like Jim Brewer
[2:09:12.220 --> 2:09:17.540]  Wasn't gonna perform anywhere that mandated the vaccine and I'm just so stoked to be here
[2:09:17.540 --> 2:09:25.380]  And I wanted to give you this shirt Alex because it's my make America great again. I love it
[2:09:25.380 --> 2:09:26.580]  That's awesome
[2:09:26.580 --> 2:09:31.180]  And I'm so excited. I bought two of your books. I haven't read them yet, but they look great
[2:09:31.180 --> 2:09:35.260]  There's no pictures, but I'm so excited. Well, you should have bought the book. I'll give you one
[2:09:36.580 --> 2:09:39.540]  I'm so excited to be here. I'm gonna read these books
[2:09:40.100 --> 2:09:44.500]  Well, I'll read one of them. I'll probably have you sign them. You can read each one each time
[2:09:44.500 --> 2:09:48.780]  I'll give you ten books. You gotta read them ten times. No, but seriously
[2:09:49.460 --> 2:09:53.100]  Going back to the lockdowns, which they now admit were a total fraud the vaccine doesn't work
[2:09:53.260 --> 2:09:58.580]  Not out of ten dying lands at medical journal in Europe in the UK in the US have been triple jabbed
[2:09:58.580 --> 2:10:00.780]  I mean this thing has blown up in their face
[2:10:01.180 --> 2:10:02.700]  People are dying
[2:10:02.700 --> 2:10:08.380]  Babies like all these studies are coming out and they're just doubling down like even in my hotel yesterday
[2:10:08.380 --> 2:10:14.100]  I watched a commercial that was you know, they're basically using propaganda. It's it's like a dad with his daughter
[2:10:14.100 --> 2:10:18.780]  Oh, don't miss out on the special moments. Get your booster at Walgreens. I'm like wow
[2:10:18.780 --> 2:10:23.060]  It's like it says if none of these studies have come out at all
[2:10:23.060 --> 2:10:29.100]  It's and the babies like there's a study about babies are you know, like a good percentage of them are acting
[2:10:29.220 --> 2:10:33.900]  differently after their shot and I'm just like how I don't know how do people not see this?
[2:10:33.900 --> 2:10:39.820]  I don't know. Well, that's the thing is they they count them as having having a memory but people have a memory of
[2:10:39.820 --> 2:10:43.260]  Of of what they've done. So I don't see how they get away with this
[2:10:44.060 --> 2:10:50.060]  It's gonna be it's gonna be pretty gross when we have a generation of kids who are not able to have their own kids
[2:10:50.060 --> 2:10:57.060]  Or they're just and I could see like a group of kids having like basically a support group because their mom was going through something
[2:10:57.060 --> 2:11:01.980]  And now they're mutilated or I don't know it's like I think we had it hard growing up
[2:11:01.980 --> 2:11:05.780]  I was like, oh man, I got hit a couple times like my dad threw a chair at me
[2:11:05.780 --> 2:11:11.020]  But I think these kids now have the hardest because they'll grow up and be like, oh, yeah, my mom was going through something
[2:11:11.340 --> 2:11:18.540]  She lived in Brooklyn. She had five cats. She convinced me to get my boobs removed. I don't know and she gave me an experimental shot. Yeah
[2:11:19.900 --> 2:11:22.020]  Absolutely, so so what's front and center for you?
[2:11:22.100 --> 2:11:25.660]  I've got a lot of talking points here and you know some of the things you want to go over
[2:11:25.660 --> 2:11:29.500]  But what are some of the big stories you want to hit? Oh, I'm very concerned
[2:11:29.500 --> 2:11:33.900]  I know libs of tick tock has done some work on exposing some of these hospitals
[2:11:33.900 --> 2:11:37.340]  especially in Chicago that have been caught basically doing these
[2:11:37.980 --> 2:11:40.780]  gender reassignment surgeries these gender-affirming
[2:11:41.100 --> 2:11:42.220]  hysterectomy
[2:11:42.220 --> 2:11:43.740]  hysterectomies and
[2:11:43.740 --> 2:11:49.340]  They're just being caught red-handed and I believe one of the the hospital
[2:11:49.340 --> 2:11:56.780]  I think it was the lorry hospital in Chicago. They are basically promoting grooming. They're doing this series of videos
[2:11:57.380 --> 2:12:00.540]  Like yeah, I think they're called gender
[2:12:00.540 --> 2:12:06.420]  They're like the gender pronoun. I forget what they what they're called. Don't be scared. You're a big kid
[2:12:06.420 --> 2:12:12.300]  We're gonna cut your breast off or cut your genitals off. It's just insane. Yeah, and I saw a report out of Europe
[2:12:12.740 --> 2:12:17.840]  Where they're gonna let children decide and one out of Canada if I didn't see the stat guys printed for me again
[2:12:18.380 --> 2:12:21.180]  Canada hospitals are starting to tell five-year-olds
[2:12:21.220 --> 2:12:25.740]  They can commit suicide and if the five-year-old says they want it the parents don't have an answer
[2:12:25.740 --> 2:12:29.020]  They kill the kid. That's literally the state convincing a child to be killed
[2:12:29.020 --> 2:12:33.700]  I saw I want to die belly. Yes, I do. I saw an article that they're literally
[2:12:33.700 --> 2:12:39.980]  They're providing this to be an option for adults like they actually can if they're gonna go broke during the next couple years
[2:12:39.980 --> 2:12:43.740]  Or during the energy crisis. They can't afford to like keep their homes heated
[2:12:43.740 --> 2:12:48.860]  I actually saw this article that they're offering it like assisted suicides basically for adults as well
[2:12:48.860 --> 2:12:53.660]  So it's it's pretty blatant like if that guy's print me that because I saw them fours last night
[2:12:53.660 --> 2:12:57.380]  It was on the CVC and they were reporting it like I forgot to tell the crew to get it for me
[2:12:57.380 --> 2:13:01.660]  There was a column reporting. Yeah, we're gonna teach children to commit suicide and if they want to die they die
[2:13:01.940 --> 2:13:05.740]  Well, a child can't make decisions. Yeah, so think about how evil that is
[2:13:05.740 --> 2:13:10.100]  They don't want to just mutilate cut their breasts off or their genitals off now. They want to kill them
[2:13:10.100 --> 2:13:16.340]  I mean, this is insane. Yeah, it's it's beyond. I mean, I guess they're they're probably gonna reframe it and call it very late term
[2:13:16.540 --> 2:13:19.780]  Abortion it's just it's disgusting. It's inhumane
[2:13:20.460 --> 2:13:24.460]  There was a story that we were talking about yesterday on the war room of this couple
[2:13:24.460 --> 2:13:30.100]  I think they were out of either Canada or Australia. They're like, we don't even want to know the gender of our baby when it's born
[2:13:30.100 --> 2:13:33.940]  We want to we want to raise it as non-binary and it's like, yeah
[2:13:33.940 --> 2:13:38.420]  But you're you are in your attempt to want to not force your kid into oh, they're doing it
[2:13:38.420 --> 2:13:45.860]  They're teaching and a child's gonna comply with his parents. Yeah, they just they a child has survival mechanisms within them
[2:13:45.900 --> 2:13:49.260]  They are gonna do they're gonna listen to their parents. They're gonna listen to the teachers
[2:13:49.260 --> 2:13:51.900]  Whatever adults are around and they're gonna listen just to get by
[2:13:51.900 --> 2:13:53.900]  And I'm not trying to be mean
[2:13:53.900 --> 2:13:57.660]  But if you look at the people that have been caught in this they are like mutants
[2:13:57.660 --> 2:14:01.620]  They're pretty gross but at the same time, let's not sterilize them. I mean come on
[2:14:02.020 --> 2:14:06.940]  But there are so many forms of birth control available like for these people like their personality
[2:14:07.780 --> 2:14:11.540]  That's like you're a mutant and we understand the government targeting with a program to kill you
[2:14:11.540 --> 2:14:18.300]  But that's not we still have to warn them. Yeah, plus their children aren't and they're being opted into it by these mutant parents
[2:14:18.300 --> 2:14:22.900]  It's so sad. It's so disgusting. They're they're really maiming these kids for a life
[2:14:22.900 --> 2:14:29.460]  And I don't know I just hope like God helps them out helps them show them the way because oh, it's very abusive
[2:14:29.740 --> 2:14:33.500]  Well, you grow up hearing about Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia or whatever you think man
[2:14:33.500 --> 2:14:38.540]  That can never happen here. It is happening. It's just a new attack. It is. Yeah, they're just using different tools
[2:14:39.300 --> 2:14:46.660]  And it's just like you you know politicians our government they use the same tactics that Hollywood uses with you know
[2:14:46.660 --> 2:14:48.820]  They don't try to they just bury the news
[2:14:48.820 --> 2:14:53.980]  They don't want you to see with more and more fluffy like BS news like oh, here's what the housewives are up to
[2:14:54.060 --> 2:14:59.060]  Here's what Chrissy Teigen's doing and it's like it's just they just try to bury you with unnecessary
[2:14:59.700 --> 2:15:01.700]  distraction news so you don't find
[2:15:01.980 --> 2:15:06.700]  The news that you actually really need to know and then if you break through like and rotate or myself or others
[2:15:06.700 --> 2:15:10.820]  Then they come after you. Yeah. Yeah being canceled is definitely a sign. You're doing something, right?
[2:15:10.820 --> 2:15:16.700]  But Joe Rogan knew how to run the rail because I told folks Joe's as awake as I am but he definitely played him
[2:15:16.700 --> 2:15:22.700]  I mean, he definitely knew how to like stay in position to end up kicking their ass. He has to be very careful
[2:15:22.700 --> 2:15:28.660]  Yeah, it's hard to tell where he actually what he believes but he's like no, I don't think they did it on purpose
[2:15:28.660 --> 2:15:34.140]  I don't think they released the virus on purpose. I think they were overwhelmed it and then you know, it doesn't work and it's horrible
[2:15:34.940 --> 2:15:36.940]  Yeah
[2:15:36.940 --> 2:15:43.340]  Oh, Joe's great though. Yeah, he's like, oh, I just think they handled it wrong and they were overwhelmed and these are unprecedented times
[2:15:43.340 --> 2:15:46.300]  I'm like, oh, I don't know but at the key point he came out against it
[2:15:46.580 --> 2:15:53.260]  So that's what I'm saying. He can do is he can do is judo. I'm gonna do my frontal assault down their throat
[2:15:53.660 --> 2:15:56.100]  Chrissy mayor stay right there Chrissy mayor on Twitter

[2:17:05.100 --> 2:17:08.060]  Yeah, and first of all, let me say I love your products
[2:17:08.060 --> 2:17:09.620]  I am a granny and
[2:17:09.620 --> 2:17:14.500]  For all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me
[2:17:14.500 --> 2:17:18.580]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called
[2:17:18.580 --> 2:17:27.540]  But since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think I'm 55 years old and
[2:17:28.100 --> 2:17:31.700]  I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well
[2:17:31.700 --> 2:17:35.260]  Maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation
[2:17:35.580 --> 2:17:40.980]  But when I started taking it me doesn't happen immediately, but you know over a period of time
[2:17:40.980 --> 2:17:49.100]  I started noticing. Okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't I don't have to put on
[2:17:49.100 --> 2:17:55.620]  Derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin
[2:17:57.260 --> 2:17:59.260]  Donald Trump and the night the Republicans
[2:18:00.020 --> 2:18:07.860]  Represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic. I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't have an operational name
[2:18:08.580 --> 2:18:10.580]  In fact, I bet it does
[2:18:10.580 --> 2:18:12.580]  I bet it's called Operation
[2:18:12.900 --> 2:18:17.020]  Matador they see us as the bull and they are shaky a red
[2:18:17.460 --> 2:18:21.620]  Flag in our face and the Matador is the deep state with a long
[2:18:22.140 --> 2:18:28.820]  Skinny razor-sharp sword so that when the bull lunges forward the Matador uses the force of its weight
[2:18:28.820 --> 2:18:33.220]  They drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape as the bull
[2:18:33.540 --> 2:18:38.500]  Buries himself into the dust. They've got the ace of spades in their hand, which is false flags
[2:18:38.500 --> 2:18:42.660]  Before you launch a war you stage false flags. That's the first thing you do
[2:18:42.820 --> 2:18:46.180]  Because nobody wants to say they started a war bad guy start wars
[2:18:46.260 --> 2:18:52.980]  So every time a war gets launched by bad guys, they stage an event. This is Operation Matador
[2:18:56.940 --> 2:19:02.860]  The eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans. They financed major universities
[2:19:02.860 --> 2:19:05.340]  they ran full-page stories and
[2:19:05.340 --> 2:19:09.820]  Advertisements pushing their propaganda of New York Times other major newspapers
[2:19:10.380 --> 2:19:12.700]  That the family as we know it is a bad thing
[2:19:13.340 --> 2:19:19.340]  It must be ended and the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that
[2:19:19.820 --> 2:19:23.740]  Cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing
[2:19:24.220 --> 2:19:26.220]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner
[2:19:26.860 --> 2:19:31.340]  For my daughter my four national daughter my wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well
[2:19:31.340 --> 2:19:37.020]  I love to make breakfast and literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be
[2:19:37.500 --> 2:19:40.940]  And then all sit down together and have the communal event
[2:19:41.660 --> 2:19:48.060]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding is our normal biological actions are coming together
[2:19:48.140 --> 2:19:49.980]  They really are sick
[2:19:49.980 --> 2:19:56.380]  Evil scientific cult of filth and want to domesticate us and turn us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue
[2:19:56.380 --> 2:20:03.980]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones
[2:20:03.980 --> 2:20:15.420]  From the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:20:33.980 --> 2:20:59.420]  It wasn't until um this Friday night that I hit a wall. I was supposed to be finishing my nightly newsletter that I mentioned
[2:21:03.980 --> 2:21:25.740]  Do you like your new body I love it
[2:21:35.420 --> 2:21:38.780]  Your operation's blown 75 years later
[2:21:42.380 --> 2:21:46.620]  Christy mayor comedian is our guest in studio your calls are coming up
[2:21:48.060 --> 2:21:50.860]  Got a lot of stories to hit a lot of topics you want to hit
[2:21:50.860 --> 2:21:54.860]  What about this one poll almost a quarter of democrats believe men and get pregnant?
[2:21:54.860 --> 2:21:58.780]  These are the people that want to be our fat checkers. These are the people that want to be in control of reality
[2:21:58.780 --> 2:21:59.900]  What do you think of that?
[2:21:59.900 --> 2:22:05.100]  Uh, I don't know. I think if men had to give birth through a certain part of their body, they would think twice about
[2:22:05.820 --> 2:22:08.620]  Having these particular beliefs. It's it's really unbelievable
[2:22:09.260 --> 2:22:15.340]  Well, I see the whole transgender thing is just to confuse us and get us to accept anything and really attack the biology of humans
[2:22:15.340 --> 2:22:16.620]  And really attack women
[2:22:16.620 --> 2:22:22.780]  Oh for sure and especially as they're moving forward on creating like I I guess a race of humans that don't need men
[2:22:22.780 --> 2:22:28.860]  Or women to be conceived. They want to blur the lines of humanity. They want to make us all okay with pedophilia
[2:22:28.860 --> 2:22:35.340]  They want kids to be okay exposed to queer education and be introduced into the kink community
[2:22:35.340 --> 2:22:42.220]  They're just trying to blur every little line they can and it's all just so disgusting and they're just basically trying to rip apart humanity
[2:22:44.220 --> 2:22:47.900]  I can ask a thousand questions and I will but what else is on your mind
[2:22:48.860 --> 2:22:52.620]  Oh gosh, I mean, I think this is pretty funny. There is a
[2:22:52.620 --> 2:23:00.780]  Uh, there's a diner in virginia that or it's a country club that is getting flack because it had a 9 11 themed
[2:23:01.580 --> 2:23:03.260]  menu
[2:23:03.260 --> 2:23:05.260]  And they had they offered
[2:23:06.940 --> 2:23:10.460]  This is called tone deaf items such as chocolate silk pentagon pie
[2:23:11.100 --> 2:23:17.980]  2977 chowder first responder flatbread and they got into a lot of they got a lot of flack basically for it
[2:23:17.980 --> 2:23:23.740]  But I don't know. I think these guys should lean in. Uh, I think they should be like, yeah, it's controlled demolitious
[2:23:23.980 --> 2:23:28.380]  It's you know, the never they should have like never the building seven seafood tower
[2:23:29.660 --> 2:23:33.500]  Yeah, they should have like we're not making fun of who died on that one. We're making fun of the fact that deep state was involved
[2:23:33.660 --> 2:23:40.060]  Yeah, we should have like an inside job kebab. I just think that they shouldn't apologize and it's okay to be funny
[2:23:40.060 --> 2:23:42.060]  It's okay to laugh. It's okay to
[2:23:42.060 --> 2:23:47.500]  Make fun of things and tragedies like if we were all and I get flack for this all the time
[2:23:47.660 --> 2:23:52.700]  If we're just going to make fun and make comedy out of the happy times in our life, that's going to be pretty boring
[2:23:52.780 --> 2:23:59.180]  So I hate that these guys are apologizing. They just lean into it. What do they should have in the midterm 61 days out
[2:23:59.660 --> 2:24:04.780]  Uh, I think the polygons are going to take it. I know the democrats are pretty they're pretty much freaking out right now
[2:24:05.020 --> 2:24:09.100]  And I think they're just trying to like buckle down and hold on to whatever they can
[2:24:09.100 --> 2:24:16.700]  Uh, in case they're they just completely lose and you know, I think they're just so scared and but it's gonna be interesting to see
[2:24:17.180 --> 2:24:19.180]  What happens like I know, um
[2:24:20.140 --> 2:24:22.140]  What uh, lee, uh
[2:24:22.140 --> 2:24:28.700]  His his last name is escaping me. Uh, but he is starting, you know, he's his numbers against hathie hathie huckle in new york are
[2:24:29.180 --> 2:24:32.060]  Higher than I thought they would be at this point. So that's encouraging
[2:24:32.140 --> 2:24:33.260]  Especially as a new yorker
[2:24:33.260 --> 2:24:38.860]  Well, they're running all these polls saying republics are going to lose that way people accept election fraud, which they're going to try again
[2:24:39.100 --> 2:24:40.940]  Yeah, yeah, it makes sense
[2:24:40.940 --> 2:24:47.340]  Makes sense. They're just going to try to pull that over and I know tina 4k is running against aoc. Yeah, lee zeldin. Yeah
[2:24:47.900 --> 2:24:53.100]  He was the guy who was attacked with a knife like I think during one of his rallies
[2:24:53.660 --> 2:24:55.660]  um, I lived hard
[2:24:56.780 --> 2:25:01.180]  I mean be great to see him beat her but again like they could be just setting this up
[2:25:01.180 --> 2:25:03.180]  For more election fraud
[2:25:03.900 --> 2:25:09.740]  Anywhere they can what are you seeing the pulse of the country being I'm seeing a total awakening me too and it's uh
[2:25:10.460 --> 2:25:14.620]  You know, sometimes you get a little bit annoyed with like saying the same things over and over again
[2:25:14.620 --> 2:25:20.380]  But I'm finding like the average people are I think the baseline level of awareness is starting to rise
[2:25:20.860 --> 2:25:24.220]  Much higher than it was even at this time last year people are
[2:25:24.220 --> 2:25:31.900]  Over getting boosters people are done with the institutions people are have fully lost faith in in the medical industry
[2:25:32.460 --> 2:25:34.460]  and big pharma and
[2:25:35.020 --> 2:25:39.340]  Everything really so and I remember that's when I first heard about you a year and a half ago
[2:25:39.340 --> 2:25:41.660]  Whatever you were against the lockdowns. You were against
[2:25:42.140 --> 2:25:46.300]  Wearing masks making people take shots together your shows and a lot of the people followed you after that
[2:25:46.300 --> 2:25:47.820]  That's what leadership is about
[2:25:47.820 --> 2:25:52.540]  They all thank you. Yeah, sometimes you wonder, you know, you're just sometimes like, oh, I'm just sending out tweets
[2:25:52.540 --> 2:25:57.580]  I'm just sending out dick jokes like who was even seeing any of this but it it does make a difference
[2:25:58.220 --> 2:26:03.500]  Um, just a little bit just one person at a time if you can wake them up and make them think for themselves
[2:26:03.580 --> 2:26:08.940]  It's it makes a huge difference and I had some gigs that were scheduled in california that I cancelled because I was like
[2:26:08.940 --> 2:26:11.340]  I'm not going to perform anywhere that forces people to
[2:26:11.980 --> 2:26:15.740]  Take the vaccine or wear masks or any of this any of this bs. So
[2:26:16.460 --> 2:26:20.940]  Uh, I it feels good to like to have been one of the first people who kind of stood up against it
[2:26:20.940 --> 2:26:25.420]  Because I think it emboldened a lot of people to do the same and it's it's always hard as to be, you know
[2:26:25.500 --> 2:26:30.540]  The first person to do anything, but I think we're all starting to come together as a group and
[2:26:31.500 --> 2:26:34.620]  You know, yeah, it feels like there's more of a baseline bravery
[2:26:35.100 --> 2:26:37.100]  Among just like your average american
[2:26:37.580 --> 2:26:38.780]  I don't think it's fair to say
[2:26:38.780 --> 2:26:42.460]  I think it's an established fact they admit this that there's a total collapse
[2:26:42.860 --> 2:26:49.500]  In corporate media viewership trust support and explosion alternative media all the attempts at censorship the last four years
[2:26:49.500 --> 2:26:56.220]  Again have only created a strident effect. Why do they think that they could override history and override the trend?
[2:26:56.860 --> 2:26:57.820]  Yeah, exactly
[2:26:57.820 --> 2:27:03.020]  I I didn't even know who andrew tate was until he got completely cancelled and now I'm just like
[2:27:03.500 --> 2:27:07.020]  Trying to find more and more videos of the guy and learn all I can about him
[2:27:07.100 --> 2:27:12.940]  So I think anytime somebody is cancelled off any of these major platforms. It just peaks more curiosity
[2:27:13.660 --> 2:27:18.540]  I taped an hour long interview with him this morning. We're gonna air it on monday and uh, he's never been stronger
[2:27:18.540 --> 2:27:21.420]  Wow, and he's not buckling to the attack. That's what's beautiful
[2:27:21.820 --> 2:27:27.260]  Yeah, because he just like kevin samuels are offering up something that a kind of advice
[2:27:27.740 --> 2:27:34.540]  That men and women haven't been haven't been getting ever and I think you know most they want people to be sheep and listen to the mainstream
[2:27:34.620 --> 2:27:39.500]  They want women to stay feminists and you know do all the things that don't make them attractive
[2:27:40.060 --> 2:27:46.300]  And same thing with men they want men to be weak and basically they want all of humanity to not reach their full potential
[2:27:46.300 --> 2:27:50.060]  They don't want people and we hear feminist. That's anti feminine
[2:27:51.340 --> 2:27:52.380]  Oh, yeah, right
[2:27:52.380 --> 2:27:59.420]  It's they're not supporting women to be strong in the ways that women are typically strong like they're not encouraging women to be nurturing or
[2:28:00.060 --> 2:28:02.540]  empathetic or compassionate or you know
[2:28:03.820 --> 2:28:09.660]  Make sandwiches, you know the areas that we really excel in they just they want women to do a lot of amazing things
[2:28:09.660 --> 2:28:11.660]  the point is we're a biological team
[2:28:12.060 --> 2:28:12.940]  and
[2:28:12.940 --> 2:28:18.940]  All these globalists trying to use women as their front person. Yeah, I I mean I think women are a little easier to
[2:28:19.260 --> 2:28:24.300]  Psi up. I think that's that's why it helps to have friends with all that's what's great about being a comic is like
[2:28:24.300 --> 2:28:27.100]  I'm friends with a lot of guys and uh, yeah
[2:28:27.260 --> 2:28:33.500]  We definitely need each other and I think a lot and I'm and I know from experience. I was a women's studies minor in college
[2:28:33.580 --> 2:28:38.540]  I was a full-boned feminist. I graduated. I was the whole like I'm never gonna get married. I'm never gonna have kids
[2:28:38.540 --> 2:28:41.500]  I had short hair like I was the whole I was the whole
[2:28:41.500 --> 2:28:47.740]  They were stealing your power. They they really were and I was unhappy all the time and I couldn't figure out why well now
[2:28:47.740 --> 2:28:51.100]  You're happy. Let's talk about feminism versus real femininity straight ahead
[2:28:57.180 --> 2:29:02.620]  The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders

[2:33:48.620 --> 2:33:49.820]  so
[2:33:49.820 --> 2:33:55.100]  Christy mayor you're talking about fake feminism versus femininity and the real power of women
[2:33:55.660 --> 2:33:59.180]  And now they have all these men trying to say they're women sealing that power your your take on that
[2:33:59.420 --> 2:34:04.540]  Yeah, for me. I mean i was very much a brainwashed feminist in college after graduation
[2:34:04.780 --> 2:34:10.940]  And then part of my awakening was realizing like wow i can get this air conditioner in this window by myself
[2:34:10.940 --> 2:34:15.660]  It's so easy to be a feminist until you need something lifted and then i was like, you know what like
[2:34:15.660 --> 2:34:20.380]  Men are not so bad after all like who's going to help me put this furniture together
[2:34:20.700 --> 2:34:23.340]  Um, and that's just what the government wants to do
[2:34:23.420 --> 2:34:27.660]  They want you to be reliant on them and not another man and honestly
[2:34:27.740 --> 2:34:30.220]  I give so much props and thanks to my
[2:34:30.460 --> 2:34:33.500]  Piancé frank pilgrino because like honestly when he met me
[2:34:33.580 --> 2:34:41.100]  I was just coming out of my like disgusting feminist phase and he helps guide me and support me and he helped me start a business and
[2:34:41.100 --> 2:34:46.700]  I was about to say i mean it's not bad for a man to say i want what's pretty i mean you're i'm glad you grew your hair
[2:34:46.700 --> 2:34:48.700]  It's very lovely. Thank you
[2:34:50.060 --> 2:34:53.180]  And it's okay for men to admire that i mean they want to isolate us from each other
[2:34:53.420 --> 2:34:57.260]  When it's men and women together to create that dynamism. Yeah. Oh for sure
[2:34:57.500 --> 2:35:01.580]  This is why i don't understand when women get upset about being cackled. It's like girl
[2:35:02.060 --> 2:35:07.900]  Like enjoy these moments. Okay, they're not gonna last forever. Okay, like when you get dusty, you're not gonna get cackled
[2:35:07.900 --> 2:35:13.820]  Well, let's talk about that. I mean look desmond morris the great animal behaviorist
[2:35:14.220 --> 2:35:16.060]  pointed out that you call dogs parasites
[2:35:16.060 --> 2:35:17.580]  I mean, they're these hunter wolves
[2:35:17.580 --> 2:35:20.380]  The family came to the campfire and got some food and got domesticated
[2:35:20.380 --> 2:35:22.380]  But we take care of them
[2:35:22.620 --> 2:35:25.660]  And i'm not saying men take care of women men go out and fight wars
[2:35:25.660 --> 2:35:30.620]  They do the dirty jobs and and really if you study human civilization the women are really right on the show
[2:35:31.020 --> 2:35:36.220]  And so women are being taken out of that prime position by the state that wants to have the relationship with the woman
[2:35:36.220 --> 2:35:39.580]  And then have the woman direct the man hitler said first you get the women
[2:35:39.580 --> 2:35:41.580]  Then you've got the children so follow the men
[2:35:42.060 --> 2:35:43.180]  Yeah, that makes so much sense
[2:35:43.180 --> 2:35:46.060]  They they want women and men to hate each other to detach
[2:35:46.780 --> 2:35:53.020]  And actually having a good man in your life in your life makes you a much stronger and more feminine woman
[2:35:53.100 --> 2:35:57.900]  And they don't want us realizing that they want us to let's you think the feminists are anti-feminine
[2:35:58.460 --> 2:36:05.420]  Yeah, they won't they only accept a certain type of being female which is to be angry and to hate men and to
[2:36:05.420 --> 2:36:10.940]  Be an island and not need anyone and they're so unhappy and they don't know why well, they're pimps
[2:36:11.100 --> 2:36:14.620]  I mean lord stonham was cia they want to run the power that's women
[2:36:14.940 --> 2:36:17.340]  Yeah, they want to act like men instead of women
[2:36:17.980 --> 2:36:22.780]  Interfacing with men running each other. Yeah. Yeah, we get a man and woman together. It's like boom
[2:36:23.180 --> 2:36:29.020]  We need each other and like my fiance makes me a better person like I hope I make him a better person
[2:36:29.020 --> 2:36:33.340]  But he is like he is like the brains. He helps me so much with my podcast
[2:36:33.340 --> 2:36:38.940]  He he really is so supportive. There's no way I would be here if it weren't for him. There's no way I would
[2:36:39.100 --> 2:36:42.220]  I mean, I lost my I had a day job up until december
[2:36:42.700 --> 2:36:48.380]  And they fired me because I wouldn't take the vaccine and they wanted to so go back and work in the building in new york city
[2:36:48.860 --> 2:36:55.180]  Uh, but now you're gonna be more powerful full time. Oh, yeah, full full blast. I'm doing this. I I celebrated
[2:36:55.180 --> 2:36:57.180]  I bought more push-up bras
[2:36:57.180 --> 2:37:00.540]  So I'm ready to just go full blasts comedian podcaster
[2:37:00.540 --> 2:37:05.180]  The power structure is losing their war against humanity in my view
[2:37:05.580 --> 2:37:06.460]  I think so too
[2:37:06.460 --> 2:37:07.180]  I think so too
[2:37:07.180 --> 2:37:12.380]  I think like women are realizing that they are more powerful when they find the right man because the right man will
[2:37:12.540 --> 2:37:16.540]  Uplift you and help you achieve your dreams and it's like the government's not going to do that
[2:37:16.780 --> 2:37:20.460]  They want you working nine to five for them until the day you die
[2:37:20.540 --> 2:37:25.580]  I mean a man and woman together is a team. Yeah. Yeah, you were the team that can like literally a man and a woman together
[2:37:25.660 --> 2:37:27.660]  Create a holding civilization. I mean
[2:37:27.660 --> 2:37:31.820]  We're literally make babies that can feed them and the men go out and get the foot. I mean, it's like a team
[2:37:32.060 --> 2:37:34.700]  Yeah, I mean it's like a terraforming operation like
[2:37:35.660 --> 2:37:40.460]  Are you trying to get me to reproduce with you alex? Is that what this is leading to? I've already reproduced a few times
[2:37:42.220 --> 2:37:48.300]  No, I mean seriously, I'm just saying it's powerful. It really is and they don't want you to know how powerful it is
[2:37:48.940 --> 2:37:53.340]  Um, you you guys we were meant to be together. I mean, I feel like I'm like preaching to the choir here
[2:37:53.340 --> 2:38:00.700]  But like they just in so many cases the powers that be don't want us to know how powerful we are and what we can achieve
[2:38:01.260 --> 2:38:03.260]  You know when we work together
[2:38:03.340 --> 2:38:06.140]  Well, that's the whole point of the species. Yeah when that happens
[2:38:06.140 --> 2:38:11.100]  That's the what they go. Oh, we want to end biology of men and women don't how we operate is that biology?
[2:38:11.420 --> 2:38:12.460]  That's what we do
[2:38:12.460 --> 2:38:16.220]  Then we have children and we love the future because we love them then we build a better world
[2:38:16.540 --> 2:38:21.500]  Yeah, absolutely, and I it's finally like I got engaged maybe a couple months ago and people are in my comments
[2:38:21.500 --> 2:38:27.020]  Like oh my god, you're glowing. You look so happy and it's like yeah, I feel loved like this is great
[2:38:27.020 --> 2:38:32.940]  This is this tops all the years of like random casual hand jobs
[2:38:33.180 --> 2:38:35.500]  Like just like you know wait till you have children
[2:38:36.060 --> 2:38:38.060]  There's a switch is gonna get flipped
[2:38:39.420 --> 2:38:43.660]  You're not talking about hand jobs anymore. No, I'm not no once you get once you have a child
[2:38:44.300 --> 2:38:46.300]  It's like next level
[2:38:46.620 --> 2:38:49.580]  I'm hoping it'll all snap back. I'm hoping it'll just
[2:38:49.580 --> 2:38:51.580]  Be toyed again
[2:38:51.980 --> 2:38:54.620]  Well, we're all gonna die, but we live through our children forever
[2:38:54.940 --> 2:38:59.820]  That's true, and I'm telling you men and women together is a ritual having a child like when the sperm meets the egg
[2:38:59.900 --> 2:39:04.700]  There's an explosion of electricity. This is big time. Wow, like this is this is this is it
[2:39:05.340 --> 2:39:08.700]  That's exciting. No, it is. I don't teach you that in school. They're like, oh
[2:39:09.260 --> 2:39:13.020]  You have to get an abortion because you know, we don't want anything to interrupt brunch
[2:39:13.100 --> 2:39:15.660]  You have to be the mimosa queen till you're 60
[2:39:15.660 --> 2:39:20.940]  Well, it's right that gets in the way of your fun and then all these liberal women are 45 50 with no man
[2:39:21.420 --> 2:39:23.420]  Or they got some man that literally, you know
[2:39:23.740 --> 2:39:26.700]  Does nothing and they're totally unhappy. It's crazy. Yeah
[2:39:26.700 --> 2:39:31.100]  I know I noticed a lot of women that were like kind of stayed on the feminist track that I went to college with like
[2:39:31.420 --> 2:39:35.740]  the men that they're with now are weak and they look everyone looks sad and
[2:39:36.700 --> 2:39:41.260]  I just don't think what's the the sad part of it is of course not everyone is meant to like be married
[2:39:41.260 --> 2:39:42.860]  Some people are very happy being alone
[2:39:42.860 --> 2:39:50.220]  But for the women who do want that they are brainwashed for just enough years that it's like almost sometimes too late for them
[2:39:50.300 --> 2:39:52.380]  When they wake up and they're like, oh shoot them
[2:39:53.020 --> 2:39:57.660]  I'm like 40 or they become wedded to the system and get more extreme. Yeah. I mean, look at these women
[2:39:58.700 --> 2:40:05.100]  Oh, I mean, I'm enjoying the the one that looks like a middle school desk in like the middle there
[2:40:05.740 --> 2:40:09.660]  But this is yes. This is not a good site. I think blue hair is considered
[2:40:09.660 --> 2:40:14.140]  Well, look what they've done to themselves to show some servants giving up their humanity
[2:40:14.860 --> 2:40:18.940]  Oh, yeah, because they're like, you know, this is their way of either their thing
[2:40:19.020 --> 2:40:21.740]  They don't know that they're angry with their parents. They don't know
[2:40:22.540 --> 2:40:25.100]  You know, these women need love and support and
[2:40:25.900 --> 2:40:28.460]  They're they're not going to be cured. I think on their own
[2:40:28.460 --> 2:40:32.220]  We have to like sometimes and embrace these people and show them the way
[2:40:32.780 --> 2:40:36.540]  We do. Let's see. I'm a calling before we go to break. Who is up first here
[2:40:36.540 --> 2:40:41.500]  Let's talk about Trump and the vaccines after the break
[2:40:41.500 --> 2:40:46.300]  But let's talk about Andrew Tate in the interview coming up with Bart in Georgia Bart. You're on the air
[2:40:47.900 --> 2:40:55.260]  Yes, sir, um, there's there's a reason um, Andrew Tate got banned. He promotes heterosexuality making money
[2:40:55.980 --> 2:40:57.180]  and
[2:40:57.180 --> 2:41:00.380]  Masculine strength and what I'm about to say is really going to make something mad
[2:41:00.380 --> 2:41:03.420]  But if this lady can talk about hand jobs, I should be able to say this
[2:41:03.420 --> 2:41:09.340]  The reason Tate got banned from youtube is because there's nothing but spears and queers there and I don't see any horns
[2:41:10.060 --> 2:41:12.060]  Spears and queers. That's funny
[2:41:12.700 --> 2:41:16.380]  No, I mean, I mean, they're really afraid of men activating their power
[2:41:16.860 --> 2:41:21.020]  Oh, absolutely men are super powerful and you need to hold them back and
[2:41:21.340 --> 2:41:24.300]  Tell them that everything they do is like wanting to look good is gay
[2:41:24.700 --> 2:41:27.900]  wanting to work out is all right and they're just trying to
[2:41:27.900 --> 2:41:34.620]  Work everything you do to better yourself. It's not like Andrew just acts tough. He's like fought all the top people and bare knuckles and beat their
[2:41:34.620 --> 2:41:35.580]  brains out
[2:41:35.580 --> 2:41:39.740]  Like they're afraid of him in the ufc. I mean on record like I mean, I mean this guy's a killer
[2:41:40.060 --> 2:41:43.500]  Wow, he's like six three. I met him in person. You're like him his brother like
[2:41:44.140 --> 2:41:46.380]  Yeah, I mean, it's like these guys ain't messing around
[2:41:46.540 --> 2:41:51.740]  That's somebody you need a friend like that to help you move because they could help they could carry a couch all by themselves
[2:41:51.980 --> 2:41:53.980]  That's what I'm seeing. What else you want to say Bart?
[2:41:53.980 --> 2:41:57.820]  I just wanted to tell Andrew Tate. I sent him an email and he responded
[2:41:58.380 --> 2:42:01.820]  Saying he wasn't going to click on my link to my videos because I wasn't in the war room
[2:42:01.900 --> 2:42:06.620]  I'm just a pill and Andrew Tate go to rumble and look at Bart find check out some of my videos
[2:42:06.620 --> 2:42:09.660]  I want to be I deserve to be on your podcast Andrew and you know it
[2:42:10.300 --> 2:42:16.540]  It's beautiful and Andrew Tate interview hour long this morning to drop Monday. It was powerful
[2:42:17.260 --> 2:42:19.740]  Look for that. All right, Chrissy mayor
[2:42:19.740 --> 2:42:23.980]  We're going to come back take more calls for a couple seconds and Paul Watson's going to take over
[2:42:24.300 --> 2:42:31.020]  He but listen he can barely do the next hour. I talked to him earlier. He said man. I'm in such morning right now. I'm the queen
[2:42:32.300 --> 2:42:34.780]  Truth is actually Paul's become a royalist. I'm not joking now
[2:42:35.100 --> 2:42:38.380]  He he's going to hang out with these people not the queen but the other ones
[2:42:38.780 --> 2:42:43.100]  So he's I love paul, but he's he's he's said himself. He has been sucked into this
[2:42:43.580 --> 2:42:46.620]  And and that's fine and dandy. It's a sophisticated issue
[2:42:46.620 --> 2:42:50.460]  Hey, when satan takes you up the high mountain, you know, what do you do?
[2:42:51.660 --> 2:42:53.740]  I throw him off the red box stay with us
[2:42:57.100 --> 2:43:03.260]  People ask me all the time. What is your best at tropic? You've got turbo force. You've got brain force plus

[2:43:22.060 --> 2:43:23.820]  All three do different things

[2:43:30.460 --> 2:43:38.060]  Brain force plus is a long-term acting clean. Neutropa. This brain force ultra is a super fast acting

[2:47:03.900 --> 2:47:12.940]  We are drugged out. We are following other people's opinions
[2:47:13.980 --> 2:47:15.980]  We are controlled by the media
[2:47:16.780 --> 2:47:22.140]  Today it all changes. This reality has been forced upon us. It is a choice
[2:47:22.380 --> 2:47:24.380]  Just like when I said slavery is a choice
[2:47:24.460 --> 2:47:28.940]  Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different result
[2:47:29.100 --> 2:47:32.060]  So we keep on saying I hate you. I hate you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you

[2:48:22.860 --> 2:48:24.220]  And it's almost
[2:48:24.220 --> 2:48:26.220]  a bad thing
[2:48:26.220 --> 2:48:29.900]  Because yeah, we're not victims, but we can't be so tough. We don't tell you what's going on

[2:48:47.900 --> 2:48:52.780]  And they followed the federal court and said he perjured himself. He doesn't work for info wars. They said it's a federal court
[2:48:53.420 --> 2:48:55.420]  And they're trying to put him in jail for a couple years
[2:48:55.420 --> 2:48:57.420]  And no one can't be here
[2:48:57.660 --> 2:49:01.980]  Routinely like this week because he's in court with them trying to put him in jail
[2:49:02.860 --> 2:49:08.780]  Okay, so that's how real this is. We're so I'll be quite frank. We're so tough. We're just like, okay, whatever
[2:49:09.340 --> 2:49:12.620]  We're so close to being destroyed, but this is a battle of wills
[2:49:12.700 --> 2:49:17.180]  You're holding us in place with your prayers your word of mouth and your financial support
[2:49:18.060 --> 2:49:21.980]  But Steve Bannon surrenders to face new york indictment in wall case
[2:49:21.980 --> 2:49:28.620]  He's got a couple hundred thousand dollars on tens of millions. They raise to build part of the wall to show it could be done
[2:49:29.180 --> 2:49:30.860]  That's free will
[2:49:30.860 --> 2:49:34.620]  Any fundraiser they admitted part of it was going to the show. What's wrong with that?
[2:49:35.260 --> 2:49:40.220]  You know hunter buying to be a chinese communist agent and and be with pedophilia and all the rest of it
[2:49:40.220 --> 2:49:41.660]  And that's okay, but
[2:49:41.660 --> 2:49:44.860]  Steve Bannon raises money for a wall and keeps a few hundred grand
[2:49:45.820 --> 2:49:48.780]  That's all the guys they've had died. It's like 200 grand between like five people
[2:49:48.780 --> 2:49:53.260]  I'm surprised that he plugged this wall for a year and got 200 grand
[2:49:53.340 --> 2:49:57.900]  I mean you can't pay for your bandwidth with 200 grand if you've got a popular show in a month
[2:49:58.940 --> 2:50:00.940]  I just paid
[2:50:01.100 --> 2:50:05.740]  Yesterday because band off video is so popular. We've got one of the biggest streaming services. We've got low rates
[2:50:06.860 --> 2:50:08.460]  We had
[2:50:08.460 --> 2:50:14.460]  It's not exaggerate was like 150 million views last month on band off video. We may lower the quality of the stream
[2:50:14.460 --> 2:50:16.460]  I'm telling everybody right now because I can't pay the bills
[2:50:16.460 --> 2:50:18.460]  So
[2:50:19.740 --> 2:50:21.740]  287,000 dollars yesterday
[2:50:22.860 --> 2:50:24.460]  287,000 dollars
[2:50:24.460 --> 2:50:26.780]  So you say just go build it yourself
[2:50:26.780 --> 2:50:30.940]  Well, it takes money to do that and it takes money to be successful Steve Bannon
[2:50:32.300 --> 2:50:38.300]  Five people indicted for making 200,000 and like 211,000 dollars over a year
[2:50:39.180 --> 2:50:41.820]  He's every day raising money millions built a wall
[2:50:42.860 --> 2:50:44.860]  And they go, oh you're a fraud
[2:50:44.860 --> 2:50:48.860]  You raised money and you kept part of it.
[2:50:48.860 --> 2:50:52.700]  I mean, this is insane.
[2:50:52.700 --> 2:50:57.380]  They shut down the NRA in New York because they got a private jet for the board to fly
[2:50:57.380 --> 2:50:59.820]  to their meeting in Florida.
[2:50:59.820 --> 2:51:02.740]  Oh, you can't fly on a private jet.
[2:51:02.740 --> 2:51:06.460]  You know it's the same cost flying 10 board members as flying first class.
[2:51:06.460 --> 2:51:07.460]  This is sick.
[2:51:07.460 --> 2:51:08.900]  We should celebrate our people.
[2:51:08.900 --> 2:51:10.060]  We should support our people.
[2:51:10.060 --> 2:51:11.460]  We should back our people.
[2:51:11.460 --> 2:51:12.460]  This is disgusting.
[2:51:12.460 --> 2:51:15.580]  And they're trying to put me in jail as well.
[2:51:15.580 --> 2:51:17.420]  Chrissy Mayer, your take on this.
[2:51:17.420 --> 2:51:20.900]  I just want to help you guys sell as much male vitality as possible.
[2:51:20.900 --> 2:51:26.660]  So I'm going to buy 10 cases, bring them home to my fiance, bring them to the men in
[2:51:26.660 --> 2:51:29.260]  my life, and we're going to help you get through this out.
[2:51:29.260 --> 2:51:30.260]  Well, it definitely works.
[2:51:30.260 --> 2:51:32.220]  But I mean, this is a big deal.
[2:51:32.220 --> 2:51:33.860]  This is political witch hunt stuff.
[2:51:33.860 --> 2:51:35.700]  Yeah, it's really disgusting.
[2:51:35.700 --> 2:51:36.700]  And yeah.
[2:51:36.700 --> 2:51:39.980]  I mean, Trump pardoned him for the federal case on this.
[2:51:39.980 --> 2:51:44.420]  And I read the federal case like $211,000 or whatever it was.
[2:51:44.420 --> 2:51:48.100]  Oh my God, he they took money for everyone.
[2:51:48.100 --> 2:51:53.860]  Meanwhile, like how many like billions of dollars like has has Hunter helped?
[2:51:53.860 --> 2:52:00.980]  I mean, it's just like, but you tell people we're Bono gives less than 1% he's raised
[2:52:00.980 --> 2:52:07.140]  billions for African people banning gives 95% Salvation Army's like 85%.
[2:52:07.140 --> 2:52:09.940]  He gives 95% and then they're inviting him.
[2:52:09.940 --> 2:52:11.860]  I mean, what do you think charities do?
[2:52:11.860 --> 2:52:12.860]  Wow.
[2:52:12.860 --> 2:52:13.860]  Yeah.
[2:52:13.860 --> 2:52:16.820]  I mean, it's like he can, he can do no right because of who he's associated with.
[2:52:16.820 --> 2:52:19.820]  And he's just they'll, they'll just always see him as the enemy.
[2:52:19.820 --> 2:52:22.740]  Well, I read the indictment of the federally, I haven't read this new in the state.
[2:52:22.740 --> 2:52:25.340]  I mean, it was like, damn, he only kept 5%.
[2:52:25.340 --> 2:52:26.340]  Who can run on that?
[2:52:26.340 --> 2:52:30.380]  I mean, I mean, yeah, that's really low.
[2:52:30.380 --> 2:52:31.380]  That's crazy.
[2:52:31.380 --> 2:52:36.460]  I mean, I, I probably get 10% of what comes in here.
[2:52:36.460 --> 2:52:41.900]  But it's my operation, but I will spend all of it on lawyers and I don't care.
[2:52:41.900 --> 2:52:45.500]  It's just, it's just, it's just insane how they don't want us to have an infrastructure.
[2:52:45.500 --> 2:52:46.500]  Yeah.
[2:52:46.500 --> 2:52:47.500]  They, I don't know.
[2:52:47.500 --> 2:52:52.940]  Maybe they just want him to get desperate and start an only fans, but I don't know.
[2:52:52.940 --> 2:52:53.940]  He's never going to do that.
[2:52:53.940 --> 2:52:54.940]  Yeah.
[2:52:54.940 --> 2:52:57.740]  I love Bannon and you know, I love Roger Stone.
[2:52:57.740 --> 2:52:58.740]  I love all these guys.
[2:52:58.740 --> 2:52:59.740]  We've been persecuted together.
[2:52:59.740 --> 2:53:00.740]  It's been hardcore.
[2:53:00.740 --> 2:53:01.740]  Absolutely.
[2:53:01.740 --> 2:53:02.740]  Yeah.
[2:53:02.740 --> 2:53:05.700]  But you've got a lot of people supporting you and helping you and behind you and you
[2:53:05.700 --> 2:53:09.500]  know, there's that army of people that are behind you.
[2:53:09.500 --> 2:53:13.900]  It's just, you know, it's probably easy to forget because you, you're, so many people
[2:53:13.900 --> 2:53:14.900]  are coming after you all the time.
[2:53:14.900 --> 2:53:15.900]  I just want to be clear.
[2:53:15.900 --> 2:53:19.940]  Owen Shroyer is facing on two charges, nine months and nine months.
[2:53:19.940 --> 2:53:25.780]  So that's 18 months in federal jail for being at the Capitol peacefully.
[2:53:25.780 --> 2:53:31.860]  And we've already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars offending him and it's just sick.
[2:53:31.860 --> 2:53:36.260]  I mean, you read a federal response like Owen Shroyer purged himself.
[2:53:36.260 --> 2:53:38.140]  We want charges, federal judge.
[2:53:38.140 --> 2:53:39.540]  He doesn't work at info wars.
[2:53:39.540 --> 2:53:41.500]  He's on three hours a day.
[2:53:41.500 --> 2:53:42.700]  He's been here six years.
[2:53:42.700 --> 2:53:43.700]  It's unbelievable.
[2:53:43.700 --> 2:53:46.700]  I mean, it's like saying Mickey Mouse is not part of Disney.
[2:53:46.700 --> 2:53:50.620]  I mean, it's a Superman is not part of Marvel comics.
[2:53:50.620 --> 2:53:53.580]  It's the, when you read that, it's like, who are these people?
[2:53:53.580 --> 2:53:56.940]  How does, because they get away with lying and fraud constantly.
[2:53:56.940 --> 2:53:57.940]  It's so disgusting.
[2:53:57.940 --> 2:53:58.940]  I was a January six, two.
[2:53:58.940 --> 2:53:59.940]  I was outside.
[2:53:59.940 --> 2:54:00.940]  I was doing interviews.
[2:54:00.940 --> 2:54:02.540]  I was doing like man on the street stuff.
[2:54:02.540 --> 2:54:07.820]  And I still, I have people still today, like tagging at my DMs, tagging Twitter, like at
[2:54:07.820 --> 2:54:09.740]  FBI, come get your girl.
[2:54:09.740 --> 2:54:12.260]  And it's, I mean, I made jokes out of it.
[2:54:12.260 --> 2:54:16.660]  I'm trying to make the best of it, but people are relentless and it's disgusting how anyone
[2:54:16.660 --> 2:54:20.060]  involved with that day is being so vilified.
[2:54:20.060 --> 2:54:22.780]  Let's talk to New Orleans, Louisiana.
[2:54:22.780 --> 2:54:24.500]  Let's talk to Greg and then Aaron.
[2:54:24.500 --> 2:54:25.500]  Greg, you're on the air.
[2:54:25.500 --> 2:54:26.500]  Go ahead.
[2:54:26.500 --> 2:54:27.500]  How are you doing?
[2:54:27.500 --> 2:54:28.500]  Alex?
[2:54:28.500 --> 2:54:29.500]  Great to speak with you.
[2:54:29.500 --> 2:54:30.900]  How are you doing there, brother?
[2:54:30.900 --> 2:54:31.900]  Thank you.
[2:54:31.900 --> 2:54:36.700]  I've been listening to you for 12 years and then you're accustomed to for 12 years.
[2:54:36.700 --> 2:54:37.700]  It's great.
[2:54:37.700 --> 2:54:38.700]  Love all your products.
[2:54:38.700 --> 2:54:39.700]  So just talking to you.
[2:54:39.700 --> 2:54:40.700]  Alex Jones is right.
[2:54:40.700 --> 2:54:41.700]  T-shirt.
[2:54:41.700 --> 2:54:42.700]  Love it.
[2:54:42.700 --> 2:54:43.700]  I'm going to be wearing that.
[2:54:43.700 --> 2:54:48.020]  I got about six of your bumper stickers on the back of my car and I do reach around
[2:54:48.020 --> 2:54:49.020]  New Orleans.
[2:54:49.020 --> 2:54:52.540]  And I'm telling you, man, everybody should do it because your rear view mirror becomes
[2:54:52.540 --> 2:54:54.540]  like an entertainment center.
[2:54:54.540 --> 2:54:59.900]  I've seen everything from people giving a thumbs up, the bird finger, and it just gets
[2:54:59.900 --> 2:55:01.860]  a lot of attention.
[2:55:01.860 --> 2:55:04.060]  And this guy actually gave me a job.
[2:55:04.060 --> 2:55:10.220]  He stopped me in a Popeyes drive-through and he offered me a job because he liked the bumper
[2:55:10.220 --> 2:55:11.220]  sticker so much.
[2:55:11.220 --> 2:55:12.220]  Oh yeah.
[2:55:12.220 --> 2:55:17.340]  Wearing a full-war shirt, sporting a full-war sticker is like joining the adventure.
[2:55:17.340 --> 2:55:19.420]  I mean, it's not a lie.
[2:55:19.420 --> 2:55:21.420]  It's real.
[2:55:21.420 --> 2:55:22.420]  Absolutely.
[2:55:22.420 --> 2:55:26.100]  Yeah, but I wanted to bring up Trump.
[2:55:26.100 --> 2:55:31.660]  I believe you did give him a September 23rd deadline to say something about this.
[2:55:31.660 --> 2:55:32.660]  Yep.
[2:55:32.660 --> 2:55:33.660]  It didn't matter.
[2:55:33.660 --> 2:55:38.420]  He contacted me and said, fuck, excuse me, he said, he said, shut up, I don't hear from
[2:55:38.420 --> 2:55:39.420]  you now.
[2:55:39.420 --> 2:55:41.780]  Sorry, I got a response back in two days.
[2:55:41.780 --> 2:55:44.220]  He said, just, I don't want to hear from you again.
[2:55:44.220 --> 2:55:45.220]  Wow.
[2:55:45.220 --> 2:55:48.500]  Yeah, this is like paramount times.
[2:55:48.500 --> 2:55:51.420]  I can't imagine what that man must be going through.
[2:55:51.420 --> 2:55:52.420]  No, I get it.
[2:55:52.420 --> 2:55:53.420]  He's under attack.
[2:55:53.420 --> 2:55:54.420]  He did so many great things.
[2:55:54.420 --> 2:55:55.420]  Roe v. Wade, all of it.
[2:55:55.420 --> 2:55:56.420]  I want to support him.
[2:55:56.420 --> 2:55:57.420]  But the shot's poison.
[2:55:57.420 --> 2:55:59.100]  9 out of 10 die and took it.
[2:55:59.100 --> 2:56:00.500]  So I just, it's a deal breaker.
[2:56:00.500 --> 2:56:02.020]  I mean, I can't sign on.
[2:56:02.020 --> 2:56:03.460]  Now they're giving six month old babies.
[2:56:03.460 --> 2:56:06.820]  So I mean, some of the losers are pissed that I'm being mad at Trump.
[2:56:06.820 --> 2:56:09.540]  But I mean, I don't know what I'm supposed to do here.
[2:56:09.540 --> 2:56:13.940]  Well, I'm a born-again Christian and I can tell you that I feel the power of God like
[2:56:13.940 --> 2:56:14.940]  never before.
[2:56:14.940 --> 2:56:15.940]  Okay.
[2:56:15.940 --> 2:56:16.940]  I do too.
[2:56:16.940 --> 2:56:17.940]  Isn't it incredible?
[2:56:17.940 --> 2:56:18.940]  It's so wonderful.
[2:56:18.940 --> 2:56:25.340]  It's like, you know, the scripture says Isaiah 59, 19, so shall they fear in the name of
[2:56:25.340 --> 2:56:30.260]  the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising the sun when the enemy comes in,
[2:56:30.260 --> 2:56:31.260]  shall come in like a flood.
[2:56:31.260 --> 2:56:34.100]  The spirit of the world will raise up a standard against them.
[2:56:34.100 --> 2:56:37.980]  That is so true right now, right, Alex, because I've heard you say it so many times.
[2:56:37.980 --> 2:56:38.980]  They are attacking God.
[2:56:38.980 --> 2:56:42.060]  We are the standard of the spirit of the Lord.
[2:56:42.060 --> 2:56:43.060]  Think about that.
[2:56:43.060 --> 2:56:44.060]  This is real folks.
[2:56:44.060 --> 2:56:53.140]  So I'm like this obscure artist, I did, I've done something I wanted you to see if it's
[2:56:53.140 --> 2:56:54.140]  possible.
[2:56:54.140 --> 2:56:56.340]  I'm Gregory Shevnan on Facebook.
[2:56:56.340 --> 2:57:01.340]  If you look at the header, it's this painting called Dators at Monopoly.
[2:57:01.340 --> 2:57:04.020]  And I just hope you get to see it.
[2:57:04.020 --> 2:57:07.460]  I think I talked to Christy Lee about a month ago.
[2:57:07.460 --> 2:57:08.460]  I'll look at it.
[2:57:08.460 --> 2:57:11.540]  Tell us, tell us on Facebook what it is.
[2:57:11.540 --> 2:57:16.420]  So my name is Gregory Shevnan and it's a Russian name, but I'm not Russian.
[2:57:16.420 --> 2:57:18.220]  I found that out before my family.
[2:57:18.220 --> 2:57:19.220]  It's okay.
[2:57:19.220 --> 2:57:20.220]  We'll look it up, brother.
[2:57:20.220 --> 2:57:21.220]  Love you.
[2:57:21.220 --> 2:57:22.220]  Appreciate your call.
[2:57:22.220 --> 2:57:23.220]  I love listener information.
[2:57:23.220 --> 2:57:27.300]  We're going to go to break a few more calls for our special guest, Christy Mayer, and
[2:57:27.300 --> 2:57:33.180]  then Paul Joseph Watson, who is deep in mourning right now, probably actually is.
[2:57:33.180 --> 2:57:34.180]  Paul's a great guy.

[2:57:35.180 --> 2:57:36.180]  They're in 20 years.
[2:57:36.180 --> 2:57:37.180]  He's a royalist.
[2:57:37.180 --> 2:57:41.780]  And so we'll see what he has to say about the Queen of England, they say she's as dead
[2:57:41.780 --> 2:57:47.340]  as a doornail.
[2:57:47.340 --> 2:57:54.980]  The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass
[2:57:54.980 --> 2:58:00.780]  and so many other ingredients that are known to make us healthy, to make us vibrant and

[2:58:07.340 --> 2:58:12.060]  line as good as it's going to get, but then the supply chain broke down and it was sold
[2:58:12.060 --> 2:58:13.740]  out for more than a year.

[3:00:13.100 --> 3:00:16.140]  died, he'll give us his take on that and more.
[3:00:16.140 --> 3:00:20.540]  Right now, Chrissy Mayer, well-known comedian is with us in studio, we're taking phone
[3:00:20.540 --> 3:00:27.260]  calls and let's go ahead and take a call right now from one of these great callers and my
[3:00:27.260 --> 3:00:29.820]  phone system just, there it is.
[3:00:29.820 --> 3:00:39.860]  So let's go ahead and take a call from Aaron in New Mexico, go ahead Aaron.
[3:00:39.860 --> 3:00:44.780]  I'm calling in because I found a free radio app that plays your show, it's downloadable
[3:00:44.780 --> 3:00:51.900]  on Google Android and Apple stores, it loops the Alex Jones show 24-7, it's called Simple
[3:00:51.900 --> 3:00:58.940]  Radio, it has thousands of radio channels, InfoWars has a channel, so search InfoWars,
[3:00:58.940 --> 3:01:05.100]  the Alex Jones show starts live every day and it loops the show until the next one when
[3:01:05.100 --> 3:01:06.100]  you come on air.
[3:01:06.100 --> 3:01:08.100]  Simple Radio, alright.
[3:01:08.100 --> 3:01:14.740]  Yep, it only plays InfoWars commercials, so go download Simple Radio, find the InfoWars,
[3:01:14.740 --> 3:01:18.140]  the InfoWars channel and listen to Alex Jones show today.
[3:01:18.140 --> 3:01:24.820]  Thanks, Alex, I want to also add, just like Judge Gamble said to you, your beliefs do
[3:01:24.820 --> 3:01:30.740]  not make something true, we should parrot that same argument for the transgender dysphoria,
[3:01:30.740 --> 3:01:31.740]  you know?
[3:01:31.740 --> 3:01:37.780]  No, I agree, like this headline, almost a quarter of Democrats believe men can get pregnant,
[3:01:37.780 --> 3:01:39.860]  their beliefs don't make something true.
[3:01:39.860 --> 3:01:44.940]  Exactly, yep, and God bless Steve Bannon, Owen Schroer and all the political prisoners
[3:01:44.940 --> 3:01:49.500]  in USA, DeSantis 2024 baby, let's go, thank you.
[3:01:49.500 --> 3:01:54.540]  You're beautiful, don't hang up Erin, what else do you make of this crazy world?
[3:01:54.540 --> 3:02:01.420]  It's quite interesting, all the turn of events that we're kind of seeing right now, I was
[3:02:01.420 --> 3:02:06.900]  behind Trump but now I think we should be pushing a new candidate, I've also been thinking
[3:02:06.900 --> 3:02:14.060]  InfoWars should hold a little voting poll, DeSantis or Trump, who should we run, or something
[3:02:14.060 --> 3:02:19.060]  to that effect to get some kind of a message out there that there's a mass of people that
[3:02:19.060 --> 3:02:20.900]  want change.
[3:02:20.900 --> 3:02:25.260]  I agree, that's what I did going out against Trump and with the vaccine, is to get him
[3:02:25.260 --> 3:02:30.620]  to wake up or to make it all about the Santas, we are the grassroots, we've got a pressure,
[3:02:30.620 --> 3:02:34.580]  Trump and the Santas and other leaders do the right thing, beautiful point, God bless
[3:02:34.580 --> 3:02:35.580]  you Erin.
[3:02:35.580 --> 3:02:41.900]  And New Mexico, thank you so much for calling us today, all right, in closing, Christy Mayor,
[3:02:41.900 --> 3:02:43.300]  what else do you want to add to these viewers?
[3:02:43.300 --> 3:02:48.060]  Yeah, thank you guys so much for watching Alex, you're such an inspiration to me, check
[3:02:48.060 --> 3:02:53.100]  out my album live from January 6th on Amazon and iTunes, I'll be headlining tonight at
[3:02:53.100 --> 3:02:59.260]  the CapCity Comedy Club, come on out, have some laughs, have some drinks, but don't hit
[3:02:59.260 --> 3:03:00.860]  on me because I'm engaged.
[3:03:00.860 --> 3:03:03.020]  Oh my goodness.
[3:03:03.020 --> 3:03:06.540]  You probably can, I don't know.
[3:03:06.540 --> 3:03:09.840]  So but in closing, what else are you focusing on with your comedy?
[3:03:09.840 --> 3:03:12.340]  Do one minute of your comedy, give us one minute of your comedy.
[3:03:12.340 --> 3:03:19.500]  Oh my goodness, okay, well, you know, I did, before my current fiance, I was in an interracial
[3:03:19.500 --> 3:03:26.260]  relationship, my last boyfriend was Dutch, not ethnically he just never paid for anything,
[3:03:26.260 --> 3:03:30.860]  so and I was like, don't, I don't want, I don't want a sugar daddy, you know, I never
[3:03:30.860 --> 3:03:34.300]  wanted a sugar daddy, I don't need someone to pay for everything, but I think the next
[3:03:34.300 --> 3:03:39.300]  step down would be nice, not quite a sugar daddy, but like a paypal, I would be okay
[3:03:39.300 --> 3:03:44.500]  with like just to pick up the little things, like the extra, the extra drink, yeah, feminism
[3:03:44.500 --> 3:03:50.620]  is about having a man like he's a pet, pick up his crap, you feeding him, no, I love men,
[3:03:50.620 --> 3:03:54.100]  I love men, men are the best, but like other liberal system, the men do nothing.
[3:03:54.100 --> 3:03:55.100]  Oh, for sure.
[3:03:55.100 --> 3:03:58.980]  Yeah, they just sit there and they, they want women to just have the men hold their purse
[3:03:58.980 --> 3:04:03.180]  and just demoralize them until they opt out.
[3:04:03.180 --> 3:04:05.540]  But the women are incredibly unhappy though.
[3:04:05.540 --> 3:04:09.140]  They're super unhappy and they don't know why, it's because they've been tricked into wasting
[3:04:09.140 --> 3:04:11.420]  their lives on feminism, so that's all.
[3:04:11.420 --> 3:04:15.060]  All their genetics are about looking for an alpha to make the species better.
[3:04:15.060 --> 3:04:18.540]  Right, right, you get tricked into getting on birth control and it, and it screws up
[3:04:18.540 --> 3:04:22.540]  your picker, you end up, your body thinks you're pregnant 24 seven, you end up picking
[3:04:22.540 --> 3:04:26.500]  a much more sensitive, like a different type of man than you normally would go for if your
[3:04:26.500 --> 3:04:30.180]  hormones were in line and women are on birth control their whole lives and they don't
[3:04:30.180 --> 3:04:32.620]  realize it, it screws up with your mood, it screws up.
[3:04:32.620 --> 3:04:34.860]  It's a biological, psychological attack.
[3:04:34.860 --> 3:04:37.340]  Yeah, I want to get, when do you need to get off birth control?
[3:04:37.340 --> 3:04:40.900]  Chrissy Mayer, thank you so much, great to have you studio, glad you came here.
[3:04:40.900 --> 3:04:41.900]  Thanks for coming.
[3:04:41.900 --> 3:04:45.460]  I'm going to introduce Paul Watson, who's deep in mourning, the Queen Elizabeth has died,
[3:04:45.460 --> 3:04:57.220]  Paul may not be able to host this, stay with us.
[3:04:57.220 --> 3:05:03.260]  Our world is so full of hype, we are force fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate
[3:05:03.260 --> 3:05:08.820]  media, by the controlled churches and the universities, and why is this the case?
[3:05:08.820 --> 3:05:13.620]  Because we innately, by God, have been given the keys to our own minds, our own psyche,
[3:05:13.620 --> 3:05:19.540]  these are our own souls, and by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves and transcend
[3:05:19.540 --> 3:05:25.380]  the quote, fallen or sinful state, so the chemicals that we ingest and all the things
[3:05:25.380 --> 3:05:30.740]  we try to bring into our bodies to change who we are, are only lowering us, they're
[3:05:30.740 --> 3:05:34.900]  only making us more depressed, in the end they're only making us less filled, it is
[3:05:34.900 --> 3:05:39.380]  only by going within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower
[3:05:39.380 --> 3:05:40.380]  ourselves.
[3:05:40.380 --> 3:05:44.580]  And that's why the globe was bombarded with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the
[3:05:44.580 --> 3:05:49.940]  normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able
[3:05:49.940 --> 3:05:52.580]  to basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[3:05:52.580 --> 3:06:05.180]  And that's where the incredible products come in at infostore.com.
[3:06:05.180 --> 3:06:08.900]  The facts and comments since we're in it, yes there have been corrupt empires, yes they
[3:06:08.900 --> 3:06:13.420]  manipulate, yes there are secret societies, yes there have been oligarchies throughout
[3:06:13.420 --> 3:06:20.580]  history, and yes today in 2002 there is a tyrannical organization calling itself the
[3:06:20.580 --> 3:06:29.740]  new world order, pushing for worldwide government, a cashless society, total and complete tyranny.
[3:06:29.740 --> 3:06:35.740]  By centralizing and socializing healthcare, the state becomes God basically when it comes
[3:06:35.740 --> 3:06:42.460]  to your health, and then by releasing diseases and viruses and plagues upon us, we then basically
[3:06:42.460 --> 3:06:46.740]  get shoved into their system, where human beings are absolutely worthless.
[3:06:46.740 --> 3:06:52.980]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson from England is taking over right now.
[3:06:52.980 --> 3:06:58.580]  The Queen of England, Queen Elizabeth II has died at 96, and people can celebrate that
[3:06:58.580 --> 3:07:04.180]  but I'm not celebrating it, because ladies and gentlemen, Prince Charles, Charles III
[3:07:04.180 --> 3:07:06.900]  is about to be the King of England.
[3:07:06.900 --> 3:07:13.020]  So Paul, obviously the Queen was more conservative, her son is a globalist, and I know you live
[3:07:13.020 --> 3:07:16.820]  there, you know these people, you've interviewed these people, you're involved in it, you've
[3:07:16.820 --> 3:07:19.740]  told us on air, you're more of a royalist now.
[3:07:19.740 --> 3:07:25.980]  What on earth do you expect from this, and King Charles III, and how long will he be
[3:07:25.980 --> 3:07:29.900]  King before his son becomes King, Paul?
[3:07:29.900 --> 3:07:35.540]  Well, I reckon he'll be King for quite a while, because he's only 73 years old at the moment,
[3:07:35.540 --> 3:07:40.140]  so I reckon, you know, given their lineage, he's probably got a good two decades or more
[3:07:40.140 --> 3:07:41.140]  left.
[3:07:41.140 --> 3:07:45.940]  But yeah, it's a sad time, obviously the Queen is an icon of representation of Britain,
[3:07:45.940 --> 3:07:52.260]  she's been on the throne since 1952, over 70 years, and the country's changed a lot,
[3:07:52.260 --> 3:07:58.540]  a hell of a lot, it's almost unrecognizable in some places, since 1952, so for her to
[3:07:58.540 --> 3:08:03.900]  pass, it's kind of a passing of something far more monumental than just the Queen as
[3:08:03.900 --> 3:08:05.380]  an individual.
[3:08:05.380 --> 3:08:13.340]  We had a Jubilee celebration back in June for her 70th year on the throne, and it was
[3:08:13.340 --> 3:08:18.740]  weird, it didn't feel like a celebration, it felt like more kind of a wake for the country
[3:08:18.740 --> 3:08:26.060]  that she represented that has now been lost, thanks to, you know, massive political polarization,
[3:08:26.060 --> 3:08:32.580]  thanks to mass immigration that's continually changed the identity of entire areas of the
[3:08:32.580 --> 3:08:33.580]  country.
[3:08:33.580 --> 3:08:39.620]  So it is sad in a way, of course, the vilest people you can imagine, the anti-racists,
[3:08:39.620 --> 3:08:44.980]  the anti-colonialists, despite the fact that the Queen decolonized much of the world, are
[3:08:44.980 --> 3:08:51.620]  out on Twitter celebrating it, feverishly popping champagne corks, so to align with
[3:08:51.620 --> 3:08:56.380]  those kind of people, I want to steer well away from that because, you know, it is sad,
[3:08:56.380 --> 3:09:00.300]  not devastating because I wasn't intimately tied in with supporting the royal family,
[3:09:00.300 --> 3:09:06.660]  but for the country, it does mark the passing of a time which was very different to what
[3:09:06.660 --> 3:09:13.420]  Britain manifests itself as today, so in that sense, it does feel quite monumental whether
[3:09:13.420 --> 3:09:15.660]  you like the royalty of the monarchy or not.
[3:09:15.660 --> 3:09:19.700]  Paul, I totally agree with you, and this is very nuanced.
[3:09:19.700 --> 3:09:24.900]  They demonize the British royal family, they attack it, the left hates it, so that makes
[3:09:24.900 --> 3:09:30.460]  us as conservatives or nationalists or Christians or populists want to then support it.
[3:09:30.460 --> 3:09:32.220]  I don't think she was a bad person.
[3:09:32.220 --> 3:09:34.180]  I totally agree with what you're saying.
[3:09:34.180 --> 3:09:38.980]  So I'm sad the Queen of England died, I think overall she was probably a good person.
[3:09:38.980 --> 3:09:43.060]  The longest living monarch in world history from the numbers we have, not just British
[3:09:43.060 --> 3:09:47.660]  history, 70 years, and so this is a big deal.
[3:09:47.660 --> 3:09:52.420]  But just because the left attacks her doesn't mean I support the whole structure that's
[3:09:52.420 --> 3:09:58.780]  now taken over the British Empire and what is behind it, and so I'm really concerned
[3:09:58.780 --> 3:10:05.740]  about Prince Charles and his whole globalist carbon tax new world order system coming in
[3:10:05.740 --> 3:10:10.660]  so we can talk about the Queen being dead all day long out of the left celebrating it,
[3:10:10.660 --> 3:10:11.660]  and I agree.
[3:10:11.660 --> 3:10:17.180]  They vestigially see her as the enemy, and that is the enemy for them, but she was really
[3:10:17.180 --> 3:10:22.860]  the head of state and presided over the breakup of the UK and this whole third world invasion.
[3:10:22.860 --> 3:10:29.300]  So I don't want to completely abscond her or separate her from that guilt.
[3:10:29.300 --> 3:10:34.900]  Don't speak ill of the dead, I get that, I'm just saying she could have done a lot more
[3:10:34.900 --> 3:10:38.580]  against the UN replacement migration, and so that's my issue.
[3:10:38.580 --> 3:10:43.340]  I know the left celebrating it, I'm not with them, they hate nationalism, they hate sovereignty,
[3:10:43.340 --> 3:10:47.700]  even though the Windsor is not really British, she's a little British, mainly German, mainly
[3:10:47.700 --> 3:10:53.980]  Hungarian, Romanian, Dracula literally, I get that they're the symbol of it, so we love
[3:10:53.980 --> 3:10:57.740]  the UK, we love Britain, we love England, one of the most story cultures in the world.
[3:10:57.740 --> 3:11:05.260]  I'm not an Anglophile, but if I'm anything, that's my roots, but at the same time Paul,
[3:11:05.260 --> 3:11:09.020]  it's like she's being attacked, but she also went along with it, so I'm going to let you
[3:11:09.020 --> 3:11:11.540]  take over, I'm going to be listening.
[3:11:11.540 --> 3:11:16.340]  But how do we deal with the royal family presiding over all this, and now, if you didn't like
[3:11:16.340 --> 3:11:21.180]  Queen Elizabeth, man, I love her compared to Prince Charles, speak to Prince Charles,
[3:11:21.180 --> 3:11:25.140]  who really is his father's son when it comes to depopulation.
[3:11:25.140 --> 3:11:27.540]  Paul Joseph Watson of Summit Donners.
[3:11:27.540 --> 3:11:33.740]  Thanks Alex, yeah, it gets back to the whole debate of whether the royal family's ceremonial
[3:11:33.740 --> 3:11:39.380]  or they actually exercise any power, of course they own a lot of land in the United Kingdom,
[3:11:39.380 --> 3:11:44.900]  they still exercise dominion in that way, but I think what you will see, and it'll be interesting
[3:11:44.900 --> 3:11:50.700]  in the early statements and maneuvers that Prince Charles makes is the contrast between
[3:11:50.700 --> 3:11:56.540]  how interfering he is as a sovereign in the affairs of the country, which you can argue
[3:11:56.540 --> 3:12:01.020]  is a good thing or a bad thing, depending on whether you agree with him, it's very hypocritical.
[3:12:01.020 --> 3:12:05.220]  But then on the side of the Queen, you could argue that she tried to stay out of state
[3:12:05.220 --> 3:12:10.460]  affairs and maybe she shouldn't have stayed out to such a degree, given how much the country
[3:12:10.460 --> 3:12:13.500]  has changed since she sat on the throne.
[3:12:13.500 --> 3:12:19.820]  But again, that is a debate that will follow in the next few days and weeks.
[3:12:19.820 --> 3:12:26.300]  Obviously King Charles III has been named as the new sovereign of England, tributes
[3:12:26.300 --> 3:12:31.540]  are flooding in, one person who was notable by his absence in offering tributes or at
[3:12:31.540 --> 3:12:37.340]  least concern as the Queen was dying, now I think what actually happened, the rumours
[3:12:37.340 --> 3:12:40.100]  were flying and this seems to make a lot of sense.
[3:12:40.100 --> 3:12:44.780]  The Queen actually died last night, she probably died last night in her sleep, the last public
[3:12:44.780 --> 3:12:50.540]  appearance for the Queen was on Tuesday when she approved swore in the new Prime Minister
[3:12:50.540 --> 3:12:56.420]  Liz Truss and she was on camera shaking the hands of the new Prime Minister, I mean obviously
[3:12:56.420 --> 3:13:01.780]  she looked frail, she's 96 years old but didn't look too bad and that was only on Tuesday,
[3:13:01.780 --> 3:13:06.460]  so she must have rapidly declined in the past 36 hours.
[3:13:06.460 --> 3:13:10.780]  Apparently probably died last night, the doctors then came out with a statement saying they
[3:13:10.780 --> 3:13:17.140]  were deeply concerned which was basically a red flag and indication to get the machinery
[3:13:17.140 --> 3:13:24.420]  of government and of media into gear to prepare the population for this announcement which
[3:13:24.420 --> 3:13:30.540]  it probably happened last night but they delayed the announcement until about 6.30pm today,
[3:13:30.540 --> 3:13:36.180]  it has been announced that the Queen is dead, Donald Trump has come out with a statement
[3:13:36.180 --> 3:13:40.860]  from him and former First Lady Melania Trump, said Melania and I are deeply saddened to
[3:13:40.860 --> 3:13:45.300]  learn of loss of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, together with our family and fellow Americans
[3:13:45.300 --> 3:13:48.980]  we send our sincere condolences to the Royal Family.
[3:13:48.980 --> 3:13:52.780]  The best statement actually, if you are moved by this, which a lot of people are in this
[3:13:52.780 --> 3:13:58.660]  country, it's a monumental occasion, actually was by Boris Johnson, not the most popular
[3:13:58.660 --> 3:14:04.140]  person in the country right now, from either the left or the right, but he said, and he's
[3:14:04.140 --> 3:14:08.460]  a very good writer, whatever you want to say about Boris Johnson and his record in government,
[3:14:08.460 --> 3:14:14.140]  he's always been an outstanding writer, he said this, this is our country's saddest day,
[3:14:14.140 --> 3:14:18.260]  in the hearts of every one of us there is an ache at the passing of our Queen, a deep and
[3:14:18.260 --> 3:14:23.820]  personal sense of loss, far more intense perhaps than we expected, went on to say in these
[3:14:23.820 --> 3:14:27.140]  first grim moments since the news I know that millions and millions of people will
[3:14:27.140 --> 3:14:30.460]  be pausing whatever they have been doing to think about Queen Elizabeth, about the bright
[3:14:30.460 --> 3:14:34.020]  and shining light that's finally gone out.
[3:14:34.020 --> 3:14:40.180]  And that's it, whether you're into the monarchy or not, when somebody is a part of the fabric
[3:14:40.180 --> 3:14:45.420]  of the country, they become a part of your life for decades and decades and decades given
[3:14:45.420 --> 3:14:48.540]  that she's been on the throne, as I said, for 70 years.
[3:14:48.540 --> 3:14:52.020]  So whenever somebody dies like that, you don't even need to have a personal connection with
[3:14:52.020 --> 3:14:56.860]  them, don't need to necessarily like them, or the institution that they represent, to
[3:14:56.860 --> 3:15:03.900]  feel that monumental shifting in the nation, in the culture, in the world.
[3:15:03.900 --> 3:15:10.980]  I mentioned it briefly earlier, Breitbart reports US professor hopes Queen of well, raping genocidal
[3:15:10.980 --> 3:15:16.260]  empire is in excruciating pain, this was a tweet put out about five hours ago shortly
[3:15:16.260 --> 3:15:20.540]  before Queen Elizabeth died, or at least the announcement was made.
[3:15:20.540 --> 3:15:26.660]  This was a Nigerian born professor at Carnegie Mellon University who said quote, I heard the
[3:15:26.660 --> 3:15:32.660]  chief monarch of a thieving raping genocidal empire is finally dying may her pain be excruciating.
[3:15:32.660 --> 3:15:36.780]  Aside from the whole debate, she actually decolonized the empire, whether you want to
[3:15:36.780 --> 3:15:41.100]  agree that the British Empire was a force for good or not, I agree, I would argue it's
[3:15:41.100 --> 3:15:43.100]  mainly a force for good.
[3:15:43.100 --> 3:15:48.180]  But again, what kind of sick individual do you need to be to immediately get on Twitter
[3:15:48.180 --> 3:15:52.460]  when you hear of this news and celebrate it and hope somebody dies in pain?
[3:15:52.460 --> 3:15:56.260]  This is the anti-racist left, we'll be back, don't go away.
[3:15:56.260 --> 3:16:02.220]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[3:16:02.220 --> 3:16:05.100]  and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out.
[3:16:05.100 --> 3:16:09.300]  And they're doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of God,
[3:16:09.300 --> 3:16:15.540]  the Creator, and we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much.
[3:16:15.540 --> 3:16:19.380]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[3:16:19.380 --> 3:16:23.180]  with the boy, is it true?
[3:16:23.180 --> 3:16:29.020]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[3:16:29.020 --> 3:16:32.780]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[3:16:32.780 --> 3:16:39.500]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on to God
[3:16:39.500 --> 3:16:41.500]  of this world who is a loser.
[3:16:41.500 --> 3:16:44.940]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep them full wars in the air now more than
[3:16:44.940 --> 3:16:49.380]  ever because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and
[3:16:49.380 --> 3:16:54.380]  setting up is safe and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast
[3:16:54.380 --> 3:16:55.380]  they just announced.
[3:16:55.380 --> 3:17:00.540]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher,
[3:17:00.540 --> 3:17:05.740]  a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[3:17:05.740 --> 3:17:06.740]  You see it every year.
[3:17:06.740 --> 3:17:11.820]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers
[3:17:11.820 --> 3:17:17.500]  and almost all of them just screw you over especially the big firms and the big tax groups
[3:17:17.500 --> 3:17:21.140]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[3:17:21.140 --> 3:17:22.140]  this and knowing this.
[3:17:22.140 --> 3:17:27.740]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[3:17:27.740 --> 3:17:33.020]  to be able to do things tax-wise that's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your
[3:17:33.020 --> 3:17:34.020]  money.
[3:17:34.020 --> 3:17:38.740]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[3:17:38.740 --> 3:17:45.900]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com
[3:17:45.900 --> 3:17:52.100]  or call 833-900-4285, 833-900-4285.
[3:17:52.100 --> 3:17:59.540]  If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet especially as you get older
[3:17:59.540 --> 3:18:01.500]  you gain weight even if you eat a lot less.
[3:18:01.500 --> 3:18:06.380]  But I got to tell you, info wars is only about bringing you amazing products that really
[3:18:06.380 --> 3:18:07.380]  work.
[3:18:07.380 --> 3:18:12.100]  So we looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of operations with and we said
[3:18:12.100 --> 3:18:17.380]  what are the best selling natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that are out
[3:18:17.380 --> 3:18:18.380]  there?
[3:18:18.380 --> 3:18:23.100]  We looked at the top ten and they all had the same ingredients in common that is in
[3:18:23.100 --> 3:18:24.100]  this product.
[3:18:24.100 --> 3:18:31.420]  But with our new product from X7 diet force, we got the very best concentrates of these

[3:18:40.540 --> 3:18:44.860]  months and I've been doing it using diet force and also exercise.

[3:19:07.980 --> 3:19:08.980]  a toxic way.
[3:19:08.980 --> 3:19:14.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, we went out and did deep research on the safest, healthiest ways to

[3:19:53.260 --> 3:19:57.500]  great for me.
[3:19:57.500 --> 3:20:24.700]  Completing of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:24.700 --> 3:20:42.460]  Live, I'm going to get into the energy crisis in a moment but I knew it would happen.
[3:20:42.460 --> 3:20:48.740]  The national broadcaster, the BBC, is busy in response to the death of the Queen of
[3:20:48.740 --> 3:20:54.660]  England literally an hour ago, droning on about diversity and white privilege.
[3:20:54.660 --> 3:21:01.220]  That's their response as the national broadcaster in league with, by the way, this Carnegie
[3:21:01.220 --> 3:21:07.260]  Mellon professor who said she hopes the Queen had died in excruciating pain.
[3:21:07.260 --> 3:21:11.940]  A lot of other world leaders were paying tribute to the Queen, hoping for her recovery before
[3:21:11.940 --> 3:21:12.940]  she died.
[3:21:12.940 --> 3:21:16.180]  Joe Biden didn't even bother to put a tweet out by the way.
[3:21:16.180 --> 3:21:21.780]  But now BBC Radio 4, this is the national broadcaster on the day the Queen of the country
[3:21:21.780 --> 3:21:28.460]  of 70 years died, is busy telling us, this is a tweet by Sam Ashworth Hayes, about how
[3:21:28.460 --> 3:21:33.820]  the monarchy is odds with society which values equality, diversity, inclusivity.
[3:21:33.820 --> 3:21:40.220]  While the monarchy is about white inherited privilege, again, they can't go two frigging
[3:21:40.220 --> 3:21:47.340]  hours after the Queen of England dies without banging on about anti-racism and white privilege.
[3:21:47.340 --> 3:21:54.780]  It's an absolute cult and the national broadcaster within hours of the death of the Queen is
[3:21:54.780 --> 3:21:56.300]  engaging in it.
[3:21:56.300 --> 3:21:57.300]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:21:57.300 --> 3:21:59.500]  That should be a scandal in and of itself.
[3:21:59.500 --> 3:22:04.740]  Let's go on to the energy crisis now though because we've had this announcement by the
[3:22:04.740 --> 3:22:11.620]  new Prime Minister Liz Tross that basically the government is going to pay two thirds
[3:22:11.620 --> 3:22:15.460]  of people's energy bills, they're going to cap the energy bills which were set to rise
[3:22:15.460 --> 3:22:24.300]  to £6,500 a year, even beyond that, that's about $9,000 a year by next spring.
[3:22:24.300 --> 3:22:28.980]  Governments come out and announce that they're going to cap that at £2,500 basically by paying
[3:22:28.980 --> 3:22:31.060]  off the energy companies.
[3:22:31.060 --> 3:22:37.300]  Where that money is coming from, we all know where it's coming from, crippling future taxes,
[3:22:37.300 --> 3:22:43.140]  crippling future inflation, more money printing, more devaluation of the currency.
[3:22:43.140 --> 3:22:46.820]  No one really cares about that right now because they think it's a magic money tree that has
[3:22:46.820 --> 3:22:48.540]  no consequences.
[3:22:48.540 --> 3:22:51.740]  But what came out earlier in the week before this, and we're going to go to this video
[3:22:51.740 --> 3:22:58.940]  in a second explaining it further, a strange time in the UK, is one of the primary reasons
[3:22:58.940 --> 3:23:04.900]  for the government giving this mass handout to individuals to pay their energy bills.
[3:23:04.900 --> 3:23:08.940]  I'm not saying that people weren't going to struggle, that people weren't going to
[3:23:08.940 --> 3:23:13.540]  righteously steal food if they needed to to feed their families.
[3:23:13.540 --> 3:23:18.540]  But one of the main reasons the government handed out this money, which will run into
[3:23:18.540 --> 3:23:23.380]  the hundreds of billions over the course of the next two or three years by the way, is
[3:23:23.380 --> 3:23:29.380]  because the police across the country, and the headline is UK police prepare for breakdown
[3:23:29.380 --> 3:23:32.820]  in public order caused by cost of living crisis.
[3:23:32.820 --> 3:23:39.220]  The police across the country told them that people will riot in huge numbers and start
[3:23:39.220 --> 3:23:43.980]  looting shops if the government doesn't give them a massive handout.
[3:23:43.980 --> 3:23:50.900]  Now again, we've had mass rioting in England as little as 10 years ago with the London
[3:23:50.900 --> 3:23:53.820]  protests, riots that spread to other major cities.
[3:23:53.820 --> 3:23:58.820]  At the time, the Metropolitan Elite Progressive Media came out with this narrative that it
[3:23:58.820 --> 3:24:04.820]  was righteous reappropriation of wealth, that it was just poor people struggling desperately
[3:24:04.820 --> 3:24:07.980]  having to steal merely to live.
[3:24:07.980 --> 3:24:14.660]  Absolute Pollux, it was people stealing Air Jordans from Foot Locker.
[3:24:14.660 --> 3:24:16.420]  That was the vast majority of it.
[3:24:16.420 --> 3:24:19.420]  It was people smashing into electronic stores.
[3:24:19.420 --> 3:24:23.460]  It was people smashing into off licences and stealing alcohol.
[3:24:23.460 --> 3:24:29.180]  It was a feral criminal underclass which we've had in this country for decades, partly because
[3:24:29.180 --> 3:24:33.500]  of unintegrated diversity.
[3:24:33.500 --> 3:24:40.140]  Stealing things which they didn't need, criminal opportunists taking advantage of a situation
[3:24:40.140 --> 3:24:43.220]  which has been wrongly framed by the media.
[3:24:43.220 --> 3:24:45.100]  And it was about to happen again.
[3:24:45.100 --> 3:24:51.620]  We've already had a wave in recent weeks and months of mass burglaries, thefts, mass looting
[3:24:51.620 --> 3:24:53.180]  in central London.
[3:24:53.180 --> 3:24:56.100]  The media barely even reports on it.
[3:24:56.100 --> 3:25:02.300]  The only way you find out about it is via viral videos on Twitter and YouTube of groups,
[3:25:02.300 --> 3:25:10.820]  mobs of urban youth as they call them, smashing into candy stores, smashing into off licences
[3:25:10.820 --> 3:25:17.820]  and stealing sweet, stealing alcohol, this has been building over the summer months.
[3:25:17.820 --> 3:25:21.420]  The police chiefs got together and put out a report and basically said there's going
[3:25:21.420 --> 3:25:26.580]  to be widespread looting in urban areas if you don't give them a massive handout.
[3:25:26.580 --> 3:25:30.900]  They're already giving them £400 later this month and then they're going to give them
[3:25:30.900 --> 3:25:33.460]  basically pay off their energy bills.
[3:25:33.460 --> 3:25:37.260]  That was one of the major reasons why the new prime minister went along with this and
[3:25:37.260 --> 3:25:38.820]  we've got a video talking about it now.
[3:25:38.820 --> 3:25:41.220]  A strange time in the UK.
[3:25:41.220 --> 3:25:42.220]  Here it is.
[3:25:42.220 --> 3:25:45.500]  Well it's a strange time to be living in the UK right now.
[3:25:45.500 --> 3:25:50.980]  Today we have a new prime minister, yes another one, who to deal with the cost of living crisis
[3:25:50.980 --> 3:25:57.060]  caused by her government trying to desperately prolong a war 1500 miles away, is set to authorize
[3:25:57.060 --> 3:26:00.660]  a massive benefits bonanza for the general public.
[3:26:00.660 --> 3:26:04.820]  Today we learn that the primary reason for the handout is to prevent people committing
[3:26:04.820 --> 3:26:07.100]  crimes and rioting in the streets.
[3:26:07.100 --> 3:26:11.020]  An MP briefed by local police said if the new prime minister doesn't dole out enough
[3:26:11.020 --> 3:26:16.060]  free cash it would quote, push more people towards crime and lead to public unrest.
[3:26:16.060 --> 3:26:20.580]  Other police chiefs warned that crime is already on the rise, shops are routinely being ransacked
[3:26:20.580 --> 3:26:26.020]  with scenes like this in Norwood South London becoming commonplace, yet barely making the
[3:26:26.020 --> 3:26:27.020]  news.
[3:26:27.020 --> 3:26:31.460]  A woman was also violently attacked by the same mob during the same incident.
[3:26:31.460 --> 3:26:35.380]  Police have already said they don't have the resources to respond to or investigate theft
[3:26:35.380 --> 3:26:36.380]  and burglary.
[3:26:36.380 --> 3:26:40.780]  Presumably because many of their officers are elsewhere performing more important duties
[3:26:40.780 --> 3:26:43.900]  like doing the macarena at Gay Pride Parade.
[3:26:43.900 --> 3:26:51.540]  Of course no one even asks where the £100 billion plus benefits handout is even coming
[3:26:51.540 --> 3:26:52.540]  from.
[3:26:52.540 --> 3:26:57.580]  Presumably as ever from the magic money tree called crippling future taxes, yes the people
[3:26:57.580 --> 3:27:02.860]  who work hard and actually earn money will foot the bill to ensure that urban youth don't
[3:27:02.860 --> 3:27:07.500]  get upset and start smashing up JD sports and sports direct shops.
[3:27:07.500 --> 3:27:12.860]  Now I'm not saying that legitimately desperate people won't need to steal food this winter
[3:27:12.860 --> 3:27:17.700]  in order to get by without any support, but there's a big difference between that and
[3:27:17.700 --> 3:27:21.700]  mass looting the nearest foot locker so you can get your hands on the latest pair of Air
[3:27:21.700 --> 3:27:22.940]  Jordans isn't there.
[3:27:22.940 --> 3:27:28.140]  When that happened during the 2011 riots which took place mainly in London and in other
[3:27:28.140 --> 3:27:30.100]  ethnically diverse cities.
[3:27:30.100 --> 3:27:37.620]  Much of the media framed such mindless theft as a justified protest or the legitimate reappropriation
[3:27:37.620 --> 3:27:38.620]  of wealth.
[3:27:38.620 --> 3:27:43.620]  In reality it was Britain's feral underclass exercising their warped sense of self entitlement
[3:27:43.620 --> 3:27:49.500]  to engage in rampant criminal opportunism, knowing the metropolitan elite and its propaganda
[3:27:49.500 --> 3:27:52.220]  organs would give them a free pass.
[3:27:52.220 --> 3:27:55.700]  Expect a similar response to any mass public disorder later this year.
[3:27:55.700 --> 3:28:01.100]  Meanwhile the country's paper of record the London Times can barely contain its glee at
[3:28:01.100 --> 3:28:06.500]  the fact that there will be no white men in major cabinet positions in the new government
[3:28:06.500 --> 3:28:08.980]  for the first time in British history.
[3:28:08.980 --> 3:28:13.620]  But hey I guess it's just another example of institutionalised racism and white male
[3:28:13.620 --> 3:28:14.620]  privilege.
[3:28:14.620 --> 3:28:22.100]  Going to come back on the other side and talk about the situation in Europe because whereas
[3:28:22.100 --> 3:28:26.220]  in the UK we've had a government handout, promised government handouts basically not
[3:28:26.220 --> 3:28:29.820]  going to pay two thirds of people's energy bills.
[3:28:29.820 --> 3:28:34.940]  In Germany, in the Czech Republic and in other European countries they haven't had such a
[3:28:34.940 --> 3:28:40.580]  bailout as of yet, there's now mass protests on the streets that are being ignored by the
[3:28:40.580 --> 3:28:43.900]  media in the Czech Republic.
[3:28:43.900 --> 3:28:48.140]  Swiss government is saying that they will imprison people for turning their heating up
[3:28:48.140 --> 3:28:53.740]  of 19 degrees Celsius in Switzerland, it's really coming down to the wire.
[3:28:53.740 --> 3:28:56.740]  Summit, don't use, we'll be back, I will.
[3:28:56.740 --> 3:29:01.620]  Experience the next level in high powered energy new tropics with our latest brain force
[3:29:01.620 --> 3:29:03.780]  offering, Brain Force Ultra.
[3:29:03.780 --> 3:29:08.420]  Now it is easier than ever to take in the new liquid form with eight beneficial super
[3:29:08.420 --> 3:29:09.420]  ingredients.
[3:29:09.420 --> 3:29:14.820]  Brain Force Ultra is the result of years of enhanced formulation, three of toxic additives
[3:29:14.820 --> 3:29:19.180]  each ingredient is specifically selected for its many key properties.
[3:29:19.180 --> 3:29:24.100]  Some of the proprietary super ingredients behind Brain Force Ultra include Guarana
[3:29:24.100 --> 3:29:29.340]  Seep which is loaded with energy compounds and antioxidants that have been used by Amazonian
[3:29:29.340 --> 3:29:34.780]  tribes for centuries, Alpha GPC, a natural compound found in the brain that delivers
[3:29:34.780 --> 3:29:40.460]  an essential nutrient, Koli, and Ginkoli, which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant
[3:29:40.460 --> 3:29:41.460]  content.
[3:29:41.460 --> 3:29:45.540]  This product is more than twice the servings of our Brain Force Plus as well, so you know
[3:29:45.540 --> 3:29:47.540]  it's packed full of the good stuff.
[3:29:47.540 --> 3:29:53.180]  Destroy that brain fog today and secure your bottle of Brain Force Ultra before it is completely
[3:29:53.180 --> 3:29:56.820]  sold out at Emporstor.com.
[3:29:56.820 --> 3:30:03.020]  We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what
[3:30:03.020 --> 3:30:05.420]  we've known and what's to come.
[3:30:05.420 --> 3:30:10.700]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is, don't panic.
[3:30:10.700 --> 3:30:16.020]  Stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto
[3:30:16.020 --> 3:30:18.220]  a safe sound course.
[3:30:18.220 --> 3:30:24.020]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building our own
[3:30:24.020 --> 3:30:25.100]  society.
[3:30:25.100 --> 3:30:30.660]  All we got to do is survive the crash and right now we still have time to prepare.
[3:30:30.660 --> 3:30:34.940]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[3:30:34.940 --> 3:30:41.260]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water, and survival gear to
[3:30:41.260 --> 3:30:43.700]  keep us strong and at the ready.

[3:31:56.900 --> 3:32:00.180]  People ask me all the time, what is your best new tropic?
[3:32:00.180 --> 3:32:05.820]  You've got turbo force, you've got brain force plus and you've got brain force altering.
[3:32:05.820 --> 3:32:07.420]  Which one is better?
[3:32:07.420 --> 3:32:16.300]  And that's like asking what's better, a Ford F-150 or a Cadillac or a Ferrari.
[3:32:16.300 --> 3:32:18.300]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[3:32:18.300 --> 3:32:23.660]  It varies, all three are different formulas, all three do different things.
[3:32:23.660 --> 3:32:30.460]  Turbo force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy, I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[3:32:30.460 --> 3:32:34.500]  Brain force plus is a long term acting clean new tropic.
[3:32:34.500 --> 3:32:41.540]  This brain force ultra is a super fast acting new tropic that creates incredible clarity
[3:32:41.540 --> 3:32:43.140]  but doesn't last very long.
[3:32:43.140 --> 3:32:48.100]  They're all three different formulas and finally back in stock massively discounted.
[3:32:48.100 --> 3:32:52.460]  Brain force ultra is available at infowarstore.com.
[3:32:52.460 --> 3:32:57.540]  Brain force ultra back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[3:32:57.540 --> 3:33:08.220]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:08.220 --> 3:33:21.900]  Live from the Summit.News headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:33:21.900 --> 3:33:30.980]  Well back during the COVID lockdowns of 2020 and early 2021, we pointed out that this was
[3:33:30.980 --> 3:33:36.300]  a dry run, a test run for climate lockdowns that they would enforce punitive measures
[3:33:36.300 --> 3:33:42.580]  against people emitting carbon dioxide or using energy in the event of a, quote, climate
[3:33:42.580 --> 3:33:43.580]  emergency.
[3:33:43.580 --> 3:33:47.940]  Even though of course we know the whole climate change hysteria is precisely that.
[3:33:47.940 --> 3:33:50.180]  It was actually happening in some countries.
[3:33:50.180 --> 3:33:52.940]  It was happening in India in 2020.
[3:33:52.940 --> 3:33:56.620]  The government would literally come out and announce pollutions too high.
[3:33:56.620 --> 3:33:58.460]  We have a climate emergency.
[3:33:58.460 --> 3:34:06.260]  No cars in certain cities or in certain areas of cities on this day in India, simultaneously
[3:34:06.260 --> 3:34:11.460]  the much wanted fact checkers came out and said, there's no such thing as climate lockdowns.
[3:34:11.460 --> 3:34:13.100]  They don't exist.
[3:34:13.100 --> 3:34:15.140]  No one's even talking about them.
[3:34:15.140 --> 3:34:20.540]  Of course you had the WEF and all these other globalist technocrat groups celebrating how
[3:34:20.540 --> 3:34:26.260]  quiet it was during the lockdown and how nature was flourishing at the expense of humanity.
[3:34:26.260 --> 3:34:31.380]  Of course, climate lockdowns happening fact checkers simultaneously claiming that anyone
[3:34:31.380 --> 3:34:36.180]  who said that was a dangerous conspiracy theorist and needed to be banned and censored.
[3:34:36.180 --> 3:34:38.740]  So what is happening now?
[3:34:38.740 --> 3:34:40.460]  We have energy emergencies.
[3:34:40.460 --> 3:34:45.500]  We have punitive measures being enforced against citizens for using energy.
[3:34:45.500 --> 3:34:48.340]  I had this story last week.
[3:34:48.340 --> 3:34:53.380]  Power company sees us control of thermostats in Colorado during heat wave.
[3:34:53.380 --> 3:34:58.060]  22,000 households in Colorado lost the ability to control their thermostats after the power
[3:34:58.060 --> 3:35:00.940]  company sees control of them during a heat wave.
[3:35:00.940 --> 3:35:06.700]  So the same thing in California yesterday, of course, where they're asking people at
[3:35:06.700 --> 3:35:11.940]  the moment, it's asking next day, it's going to be telling not to use energy until what
[3:35:11.940 --> 3:35:15.980]  was it 9pm at night or something like that to avert an energy crisis.
[3:35:15.980 --> 3:35:19.940]  They're going to roll the energy crisis into the climate crisis.
[3:35:19.940 --> 3:35:25.020]  In Colorado, what appears to have happened was that these people signed up for a rewards
[3:35:25.020 --> 3:35:30.820]  program where if they allowed outside forces to control their thermostat or at least give
[3:35:30.820 --> 3:35:35.140]  them recommendations on what to do with their thermostat, that they would get some money
[3:35:35.140 --> 3:35:36.660]  off their bills.
[3:35:36.660 --> 3:35:41.860]  What they didn't realize at the time, of course, was that the power company could literally
[3:35:41.860 --> 3:35:48.020]  hijack their thermostat and flash up an emergency warning and prevent them from turning on the
[3:35:48.020 --> 3:35:55.700]  AC, which is exactly what happened to 22,000 households in Colorado because of smart meters,
[3:35:55.700 --> 3:35:59.700]  which we were warning you about, what, 15 years ago?
[3:35:59.700 --> 3:36:01.300]  Now we see it happening.
[3:36:01.300 --> 3:36:05.460]  Meanwhile, EU demands mandatory energy rationing.
[3:36:05.460 --> 3:36:10.540]  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen asked EU member nations to implement
[3:36:10.540 --> 3:36:13.740]  mandatory, mandatory.
[3:36:13.740 --> 3:36:14.740]  Remember that?
[3:36:14.740 --> 3:36:21.460]  In Spain, they have bands on AC being below 27 degrees Celsius, which is pretty darn hot
[3:36:21.460 --> 3:36:29.780]  in summer and being above 19 degrees Celsius in winter, fines of up to 600,000 euros.
[3:36:29.780 --> 3:36:33.980]  In other words, if you're a business that puts your heating on in winter against the
[3:36:33.980 --> 3:36:37.100]  government mandate, your business is finished.
[3:36:37.100 --> 3:36:39.100]  They have inspectors going around.
[3:36:39.100 --> 3:36:43.300]  We now have the European Commission President saying they're going to have mandatory energy
[3:36:43.300 --> 3:36:50.820]  rationing to flatten the curve using the exact same language that the totalitarian technocrats
[3:36:50.820 --> 3:36:52.740]  used to lock us down.
[3:36:52.740 --> 3:36:57.100]  We now know that lockdown was a complete scam from beginning to end, yet they're still
[3:36:57.100 --> 3:37:01.340]  deploying the same weaponized language.
[3:37:01.340 --> 3:37:07.660]  Switzerland, Swiss face up to three years in prison for violating heating rules.
[3:37:07.660 --> 3:37:10.860]  People in Switzerland have violated the country's new heating rules, which forbid setting the
[3:37:10.860 --> 3:37:13.380]  temperature above 19 degrees.
[3:37:13.380 --> 3:37:19.260]  Bear in mind, old people who are especially susceptible to the cold, again, we were supposed
[3:37:19.260 --> 3:37:25.620]  to lock down the entire society, take five booster shots to protect the elderly.
[3:37:25.620 --> 3:37:30.420]  Oh, but when it gets to winter, they're going to literally kill them off by having the heating
[3:37:30.420 --> 3:37:32.380]  below 19 degrees.
[3:37:32.380 --> 3:37:38.660]  That may seem okay for most people, but if you're elderly, you need to stay warm.
[3:37:38.660 --> 3:37:42.420]  We had an entire lockdown based around protecting vulnerable people.
[3:37:42.420 --> 3:37:46.500]  As soon as it gets to the winter, old Sodom, let's get that heating down because we've
[3:37:46.500 --> 3:37:48.940]  got an energy crisis.
[3:37:48.940 --> 3:37:54.300]  Under the new rules, buildings that use gas heating systems are restricted to 19 degrees
[3:37:54.300 --> 3:38:00.100]  Celsius, that is 66.2 Fahrenheit for you Americans, while hot water can only be heated
[3:38:00.100 --> 3:38:04.500]  up to 60 degrees Celsius and radiant heaters are banned entirely.
[3:38:04.500 --> 3:38:12.740]  They may find you $30, they may find you $3,000, or they may put you in prison for three years.
[3:38:12.740 --> 3:38:17.660]  Good news, though, is that we've now got mass protests on the streets against this, not
[3:38:17.660 --> 3:38:23.660]  against Vladimir Putin, but against the actual sanctions on Russia, against the lie that this
[3:38:23.660 --> 3:38:28.500]  is solely Vladimir Putin's fault when we had the inflation beforehand, when we have the
[3:38:28.500 --> 3:38:35.100]  disastrous net zero agenda, climate change hysteria crap that has made all these European
[3:38:35.100 --> 3:38:41.660]  countries overly dependent on green energy, overly dependent on Russian energy, to the
[3:38:41.660 --> 3:38:46.060]  point where up until a couple of weeks ago, the German government was planning to shut
[3:38:46.060 --> 3:38:52.140]  down all its nuclear plants across the entire country, despite this massive cost of living
[3:38:52.140 --> 3:38:53.140]  crisis.
[3:38:53.140 --> 3:38:56.580]  They only reversed that decision at the last minute.
[3:38:56.580 --> 3:38:58.740]  This is called revolt against the current thing.
[3:38:58.740 --> 3:39:02.380]  This is about the protest in Prague that happened this past weekend.
[3:39:02.380 --> 3:39:03.380]  Let's roll it.
[3:39:03.380 --> 3:39:09.580]  There were gigantic protests in the Czech capital of Prague over the weekend and estimated
[3:39:09.580 --> 3:39:14.380]  70,000 people marched out of a population of 10.7 million.
[3:39:14.380 --> 3:39:24.180]  That's the equivalent of over half a million people marching in Germany.
[3:39:24.180 --> 3:39:25.180]  What were their demands?
[3:39:25.180 --> 3:39:30.580]  An end to energy sanctions on Russia, neutrality regarding the conflict in Ukraine, an end
[3:39:30.580 --> 3:39:34.420]  to weapons supplies in Ukraine, and the resignation of their government.
[3:39:34.420 --> 3:39:39.220]  This was the first major revolt against the current thing crisis.
[3:39:39.220 --> 3:39:44.740]  Some of the demonstrators carried banners saying, aid for Ukrainians and two sweaters for us.
[3:39:44.740 --> 3:39:48.700]  The crowd also chanted demise, and we've had enough in reference to their desire for the
[3:39:48.700 --> 3:39:50.380]  government to resign from power.
[3:39:50.380 --> 3:39:54.780]  People prepared slogans against the EU NATO Prime Minister Peter Fiala, the Green Deal
[3:39:54.780 --> 3:39:57.220]  for Europe, and the government's rejection of Russia.
[3:39:57.220 --> 3:40:03.180]  This is not our war, the crowd asserted, angry at soaring inflation and spiralling energy
[3:40:03.180 --> 3:40:12.940]  bills, and you can't dismiss the Czechs as being unwitting agents of Putin.
[3:40:12.940 --> 3:40:17.100]  They suffered under the brutal occupation of Soviet forces right up until the end of
[3:40:17.100 --> 3:40:18.100]  the 80s.
[3:40:18.100 --> 3:40:22.100]  Similar protests are also being planned in major German cities over the course of the
[3:40:22.100 --> 3:40:23.100]  next month.
[3:40:23.100 --> 3:40:27.060]  It remains to be seen what the response of the authorities will be, given that protesters
[3:40:27.060 --> 3:40:31.740]  have already been demonised as domestic extremists and warned that they're being watched by the
[3:40:31.740 --> 3:40:34.100]  security services.
[3:40:34.100 --> 3:40:40.940]  That indeed is happening in Germany, where of course we've had numerous top public officials
[3:40:40.940 --> 3:40:46.300]  come out over the last few weeks and say, these protesters who are planning to demonstrate
[3:40:46.300 --> 3:40:52.380]  against cost of energy increases, massive spikes in bills, they're domestic extremists, they're
[3:40:52.380 --> 3:40:55.340]  just continuing from the anti-vaxxer stuff.
[3:40:55.340 --> 3:41:01.380]  We need to have literal secret services watch them, people struggling to pay their bills.
[3:41:01.380 --> 3:41:04.900]  In the UK, we've had a better outcome, of course, I talked about it earlier with the
[3:41:04.900 --> 3:41:06.420]  new Prime Minister, Liz Truss.
[3:41:06.420 --> 3:41:11.260]  The one thing she has done, the one good thing she has done, apart from this bailout which
[3:41:11.260 --> 3:41:17.020]  we'll end up paying for anyway, is she's restarted fracking in the UK, which there should have
[3:41:17.020 --> 3:41:20.340]  never been a moratorium on fracking in the first place.
[3:41:20.340 --> 3:41:25.500]  It was an energy miracle for the United States, and it was initially for the United Kingdom.
[3:41:25.500 --> 3:41:30.460]  This cost of energy crisis in terms of shortages of gas, energy rationing and so forth would
[3:41:30.460 --> 3:41:35.620]  have never have happened if we'd have kept that fracking running while now she's finally
[3:41:35.620 --> 3:41:41.340]  reintroduced it, at least lifted the ban on it, so hopefully that will come to pass.
[3:41:41.340 --> 3:41:44.700]  Economists, Europeans are mad with anger and it will worsen, that is a French economist
[3:41:44.700 --> 3:41:50.740]  Charles Gave saying that Europeans now recognise that it isn't all Vladimir Putin's fault,
[3:41:50.740 --> 3:41:56.420]  that it's their own leaders, over-dependence, stupidity of pursuing net zero policies that
[3:41:56.420 --> 3:41:58.900]  has led us down this path.
[3:41:58.900 --> 3:42:04.900]  And also, we just played the video there of the mass protests in Prague, this was censored
[3:42:04.900 --> 3:42:11.300]  by the media, obviously there were some news reports about it, Getty Images did not send
[3:42:11.300 --> 3:42:18.980]  a single photographer to the mass demonstration in Prague involving 70,000 people, bear in
[3:42:18.980 --> 3:42:21.820]  mind that's the country of the population of only about 10 million.
[3:42:21.820 --> 3:42:25.340]  If that was in Germany, as I said in the video, it'd be half a million people.
[3:42:25.340 --> 3:42:31.420]  You go on Getty Images news, type in Prague protest, the last thing they have on there,
[3:42:31.420 --> 3:42:36.820]  bear in mind they're supposed to cover world events entirely, is a protest, never again
[3:42:36.820 --> 3:42:44.060]  a pro-Ukraine protest from May 2022, from four months ago, not a single Getty Images
[3:42:44.060 --> 3:42:49.900]  news photographer was sent to a giant mass protest in the capital city of the Czech
[3:42:49.900 --> 3:42:56.900]  Republic on Saturday to document that, it's cover-up, we'll be back now, go away.

[3:46:57.540 --> 3:47:25.140]  Eating a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:51.260 --> 3:47:57.500]  that there was no white man in a major government role in this new conservative government.
[3:47:57.500 --> 3:48:00.780]  And like being white or male was a bad thing.
[3:48:00.780 --> 3:48:01.780]  It's not.
[3:48:01.780 --> 3:48:04.740]  I'm not going to get into that, but first I want to play the first few minutes from
[3:48:04.740 --> 3:48:10.220]  this new video that went up a few hours ago, because we've had some major damaging revelations
[3:48:10.220 --> 3:48:15.180]  about only fans and the damage it's doing to both men and women over the course of the
[3:48:15.180 --> 3:48:20.620]  past few days, as it's revealed that their profits run to in terms of the owner of only
[3:48:20.620 --> 3:48:25.940]  fans this shadowy pornographer, half a billion dollars in profit.
[3:48:25.940 --> 3:48:29.380]  This is called simpocalypse, here's the clip.
[3:48:29.380 --> 3:48:38.380]  Remember in early 2020 when I made that simps video, what on earth is a simp?
[3:48:38.380 --> 3:48:42.300]  Trying to urge young men against pursuing such a vacuous destructive habit.
[3:48:42.300 --> 3:48:44.740]  Yeah, took a big fat L on that one, didn't I?
[3:48:44.740 --> 3:48:47.700]  For the simps are now legion and they are many.
[3:48:47.700 --> 3:48:51.300]  Welcome to the simpocalypse.
[3:48:51.300 --> 3:48:55.900]  Only fans majority owner Leonid Radvinsky, a shadowy pornographer about whom virtual
[3:48:55.900 --> 3:49:01.580]  actually nothing is known and the media barely tries to find out, made 500 million dollars
[3:49:01.580 --> 3:49:04.940]  from only fans in the space of just 18 months.
[3:49:04.940 --> 3:49:12.140]  The company's profits have soared from 61 million dollars in 2020 to 433 million last
[3:49:12.140 --> 3:49:13.140]  year.
[3:49:13.140 --> 3:49:20.260]  They use a basis metastasized to 220 million, most of them men, with 2021 seeing a 128 percent
[3:49:20.260 --> 3:49:21.260]  increase.
[3:49:21.260 --> 3:49:27.100]  Simps spent 4.8 billion dollars on only fans last year alone.
[3:49:27.100 --> 3:49:31.300]  Lockdown handed them an army of new users and now the cost of living crisis will hand
[3:49:31.300 --> 3:49:35.980]  them an army of new creators whenever society catches a metaphorical disease.
[3:49:35.980 --> 3:49:40.820]  Only fans is the first parasite on the scene, quick as a flash to make it all immeasurably
[3:49:40.820 --> 3:49:47.420]  worse.
[3:49:47.420 --> 3:49:53.060]  Andrew Tate gets vilified and banned for supposed misogyny, he's apparently this massive dangerous
[3:49:53.060 --> 3:49:54.340]  threat to young men.
[3:49:54.340 --> 3:49:59.980]  Yet we've lost, completely lost, an entire generation of young men to simpory and only
[3:49:59.980 --> 3:50:00.980]  fans.
[3:50:00.980 --> 3:50:05.860]  Tate's the devil incarnate for offering courses teaching young men how not to be dysfunctional,
[3:50:05.860 --> 3:50:07.460]  emotionally crippled losers.
[3:50:07.460 --> 3:50:12.180]  Yet courses teaching young women how to be only fans camgulls, rapaciously feeding off
[3:50:12.180 --> 3:50:13.660]  the corpse of masculinity.
[3:50:13.660 --> 3:50:18.260]  Oh that's just fine, whether you're just showing off the only fans or in the process
[3:50:18.260 --> 3:50:20.580]  of creating one, this program is for you.
[3:50:20.580 --> 3:50:24.660]  I give you all the secret tips and tricks other creators don't want you to know.
[3:50:24.660 --> 3:50:29.340]  Only fans might literally be shrinking young men's brains, but Andrew Tate said something
[3:50:29.340 --> 3:50:30.340]  offensive.
[3:50:30.340 --> 3:50:35.780]  Only fans founder Radvinsky ran websites in the 90s and 2000s, providing hacked passwords
[3:50:35.780 --> 3:50:40.340]  to porn sites, featuring underage performers and beastiality.
[3:50:40.340 --> 3:50:48.260]  There are children as young as 14 years of age that are then seeing the opportunity to
[3:50:48.260 --> 3:50:49.260]  generate income.
[3:50:49.260 --> 3:50:54.620]  Children are getting only fans user accounts approved after using their grandmother's passport.
[3:50:54.620 --> 3:50:59.140]  Police say one 14 year old used her grandmother's passport to sell explicit images.
[3:50:59.140 --> 3:51:02.740]  Nonsense are then trying to meet up with them in real life.
[3:51:02.740 --> 3:51:07.380]  These are the types of comments she received while promoting her only fans account on Twitter.
[3:51:07.380 --> 3:51:10.140]  Some request more graphic content and ask you'll meet up.
[3:51:10.140 --> 3:51:14.540]  Missing children are even appearing in explicit only fans video.
[3:51:14.540 --> 3:51:18.780]  Childline says children have anonymously contacted their counselling service and talked about
[3:51:18.780 --> 3:51:21.460]  their experiences on the site.
[3:51:21.460 --> 3:51:25.420]  Some reported separately being victims of historic sexual abuse.
[3:51:25.420 --> 3:51:30.820]  We saw a dozen or so children that were also linked with content on only fans.
[3:51:30.820 --> 3:51:36.380]  It's becoming increasingly clear that only fans is being used by children.
[3:51:36.380 --> 3:51:39.940]  Children on occasions are being blackmailed and exploited.
[3:51:39.940 --> 3:51:45.100]  The company are not doing enough to put in place the safeguards that prevent children
[3:51:45.100 --> 3:51:50.140]  exploiting the opportunity to generate money, but also for children to be exploited.
[3:51:50.140 --> 3:51:53.140]  All of this gets a pass from the dominant culture.
[3:51:53.140 --> 3:51:54.780]  No action is taken.
[3:51:54.780 --> 3:51:55.780]  No one cares.
[3:51:55.780 --> 3:51:57.940]  Yeah, it's Andrew Tate who's the real problem.
[3:51:57.940 --> 3:52:02.860]  Yeah, he's the one who must be stopped, but only fans changed their colours to the Ukrainian
[3:52:02.860 --> 3:52:03.860]  flag.
[3:52:03.860 --> 3:52:07.140]  He's listed the black square in solidarity with Black Lives Matter.
[3:52:07.140 --> 3:52:11.300]  I mean, yeah, they may be facilitating the trafficking and sexual abuse of children.
[3:52:11.300 --> 3:52:15.260]  They may be utterly destroying normal, healthy human relationships.
[3:52:15.260 --> 3:52:19.300]  That's where your five billion beta books went, but isn't it more important that they
[3:52:19.300 --> 3:52:21.380]  support the message?
[3:52:21.380 --> 3:52:26.860]  Andrew Tate didn't put a Ukraine flag in his bio.
[3:52:26.860 --> 3:52:27.860]  There you have it.
[3:52:27.860 --> 3:52:31.340]  You can watch the rest of that video on YouTube, but I want to move into this topic and we've
[3:52:31.340 --> 3:52:36.180]  got another final video to play on this because again, we've had a new Prime Minister in the
[3:52:36.180 --> 3:52:42.780]  UK and she has chosen a government cabinet that contains no white men.
[3:52:42.780 --> 3:52:45.460]  The newspapers, the media heralded this.
[3:52:45.460 --> 3:52:47.060]  They commended it.
[3:52:47.060 --> 3:52:52.620]  Headline Times newspaper highlights how no white men will hold major office in new UK
[3:52:52.620 --> 3:52:53.620]  government.
[3:52:53.620 --> 3:52:56.500]  The Times newspaper in the UK has published an article noting how no white men will hold
[3:52:56.500 --> 3:52:59.980]  major office in the new government led by Liz Truss.
[3:52:59.980 --> 3:53:05.940]  No great officers of state will contain white men and again, can you imagine the new government
[3:53:05.940 --> 3:53:13.260]  of Nigeria, which recently banned diversity in advertising, by the way, very interesting.
[3:53:13.260 --> 3:53:19.060]  Imagine the new government in Nigeria containing no black men in any of their major government
[3:53:19.060 --> 3:53:26.260]  officers and then the media in Nigeria celebrating that as a great example of progressivism despite
[3:53:26.260 --> 3:53:30.940]  the fact that the overwhelming majority of the population in Nigeria is of course black,
[3:53:30.940 --> 3:53:36.940]  just as still the majority of the population around 86% is white in the United Kingdom.
[3:53:36.940 --> 3:53:40.460]  This video is called No Country for White Men.
[3:53:40.460 --> 3:53:41.460]  Let's roll it.
[3:53:41.460 --> 3:53:46.180]  For the first time in British history, no great office of state will be held by a white
[3:53:46.180 --> 3:53:47.180]  man.
[3:53:47.180 --> 3:53:51.980]  Liz Truss's new Conservative government contains no white man in a prominent cabinet position.
[3:53:51.980 --> 3:53:56.980]  Take that, leftists, who are the real racists now?
[3:53:56.980 --> 3:54:01.180]  Following on from The Times, the Telegraph became the latest newspaper to commend this
[3:54:01.180 --> 3:54:06.460]  as a boon for diversity, diversity that's not quite diverse enough to include white
[3:54:06.460 --> 3:54:07.460]  men.
[3:54:07.460 --> 3:54:12.100]  In Britain, where the population is 87% white, you're not that kind of diversity.
[3:54:12.100 --> 3:54:16.780]  Liz Truss forms most diverse cabinet in history with no white males in top jobs.
[3:54:16.780 --> 3:54:21.060]  She appointed her key ally, Kwazi Kwaten, who has gone A in heritage to the Treasury, James
[3:54:21.060 --> 3:54:25.700]  Cleveley, whose mother is from Sierra Leone, was made Foreign Secretary, and Suella Braverman,
[3:54:25.700 --> 3:54:28.700]  whose parents are of Indian origin, became Home Secretary.
[3:54:28.700 --> 3:54:32.860]  Meanwhile, this is the woman who has been picked to become Health Secretary.
[3:54:32.860 --> 3:54:33.860]  Hmm.
[3:54:33.860 --> 3:54:36.140]  Now, I'm not trying to be mean.
[3:54:36.140 --> 3:54:39.700]  Everyone at some point in their life has struggled with weight gain, but not everyone
[3:54:39.700 --> 3:54:41.540]  gets to become the Health Secretary.
[3:54:41.540 --> 3:54:43.300]  It seems to be a common theme.
[3:54:43.300 --> 3:54:48.140]  Belgium previously appointed a 20-stone woman as Health Minister, maybe the next Chancellor
[3:54:48.140 --> 3:54:52.460]  of the Exchequer will be someone with a history of bankrupted businesses and petty theft
[3:54:52.460 --> 3:54:53.460]  convictions.
[3:54:53.460 --> 3:54:54.460]  Or maybe not.
[3:54:54.460 --> 3:54:59.060]  To her credit, Therese Coffey, who is Catholic in anti-abortion, good for her, addressed
[3:54:59.060 --> 3:55:00.060]  her critics.
[3:55:00.060 --> 3:55:03.460]  She acknowledged that she's not a role model for health, but will do her best in the job
[3:55:03.460 --> 3:55:04.460]  anyway.
[3:55:04.460 --> 3:55:05.460]  I mean, good luck to her.
[3:55:05.460 --> 3:55:08.300]  She can't be any worse than Arch Lockdown zealot Matt Hancock, can she?
[3:55:08.300 --> 3:55:11.980]  But will Liz Truss be any better than Boris Johnson?
[3:55:11.980 --> 3:55:13.980]  The early signs aren't great.
[3:55:13.980 --> 3:55:17.780]  The first thing she did upon becoming Prime Minister was to pledge her loyalty oath to
[3:55:17.780 --> 3:55:22.380]  the current thing, prolonging a war 1500 miles away.
[3:55:22.380 --> 3:55:26.780]  And how did Liz Truss address the very real crisis of record numbers of boat migrants
[3:55:26.780 --> 3:55:29.140]  arriving in England on a daily basis?
[3:55:29.140 --> 3:55:33.820]  A massive security threat, a huge drain on economic resources, a total insult to the
[3:55:33.820 --> 3:55:36.300]  very notion of borders and nationhood.
[3:55:36.300 --> 3:55:39.020]  Well, she didn't even mention it.
[3:55:39.020 --> 3:55:43.900]  No, not a single word.
[3:55:43.900 --> 3:55:49.220]  And in further fallout from the announcement of this new diverse cabinet, Remix News reports
[3:55:49.220 --> 3:55:53.820]  ex-BVC presenter issues grovelling apology after calling new Conservative administration
[3:55:53.820 --> 3:55:55.820]  the Coconut Cabinet.
[3:55:55.820 --> 3:55:58.180]  This is a left-wing anti-racist.
[3:55:58.180 --> 3:56:02.660]  Former BBC TV and radio presenter has apologized for and withdrawn a controversial remark about
[3:56:02.660 --> 3:56:06.740]  Liz Truss's new government, referring to what is the most diverse administration in
[3:56:06.740 --> 3:56:09.660]  British history as the Coconut Cabinet.
[3:56:09.660 --> 3:56:15.260]  Now what was interesting about his grovelling apology on Twitter was that in apologizing
[3:56:15.260 --> 3:56:20.180]  for calling it a Coconut Cabinet, and again, you know, these people in this cabinet may
[3:56:20.180 --> 3:56:24.740]  be far better than the white men in the previous Boris Johnson Cabinet.
[3:56:24.740 --> 3:56:25.740]  That's not the point.
[3:56:25.740 --> 3:56:29.900]  The point is, why is the media celebrating the fact there's no white people in it?
[3:56:29.900 --> 3:56:30.900]  That's weird.
[3:56:30.900 --> 3:56:32.220]  That's effed up.
[3:56:32.220 --> 3:56:38.340]  But then this Ian McWhorter, this former BBC journalist apologized for making what he said
[3:56:38.340 --> 3:56:42.780]  was an ironic reference to a term used by some on the left about black people who were deemed
[3:56:42.780 --> 3:56:45.180]  traitors to the cause through joining the Tory party.
[3:56:45.180 --> 3:56:49.180]  And again, it's that whole narrative, bigotry of low expectations.
[3:56:49.180 --> 3:56:52.900]  They expect people's skin colour to be wedded to their political opinions.
[3:56:52.900 --> 3:56:56.420]  They think black people are all stupid and should all think the same things, but they're
[3:56:56.420 --> 3:56:58.300]  the anti-racists.
[3:56:58.300 --> 3:57:03.940]  But in making this grovelling apology, he said, quote, indeed, I tweeted earlier that
[3:57:03.940 --> 3:57:10.100]  the trust cabinet made the Scottish government look, quote, hideously white.
[3:57:10.100 --> 3:57:12.900]  I have always championed racial diversity in my column.
[3:57:12.900 --> 3:57:19.900]  So in making his apology for being racist, he proudly showcased his previous tweet in
[3:57:19.900 --> 3:57:26.060]  saying that another cabinet in Scotland was, quote, hideously white.
[3:57:26.060 --> 3:57:29.700]  What other race does he think is hideous, or is it just white people?
[3:57:29.700 --> 3:57:38.260]  And how, on any sane planet, is that an anti-racist apology for him making a racist statement?
[3:57:38.260 --> 3:57:40.740]  That's going to wrap it up for the Summit News Hour.
[3:57:40.740 --> 3:57:41.740]  Coming up next is the War Room.
[3:57:41.740 --> 3:57:42.740]  Don't go away.
[3:57:42.740 --> 3:57:43.740]  Thank you.
[3:57:43.740 --> 3:57:50.020]  Get our great bag of it here.
[3:57:50.020 --> 3:57:54.380]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the Communists?
[3:57:54.380 --> 3:57:59.500]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[3:57:59.500 --> 3:58:02.060]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[3:58:02.060 --> 3:58:05.580]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls Communists,
[3:58:05.580 --> 3:58:06.820]  but really they're just a commune.
[3:58:06.820 --> 3:58:09.820]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[3:58:09.820 --> 3:58:11.980]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[3:58:11.980 --> 3:58:13.580]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels.
[3:58:13.580 --> 3:58:16.420]  And I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[3:58:16.420 --> 3:58:20.820]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[3:58:20.820 --> 3:58:23.300]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[3:58:23.300 --> 3:58:26.700]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[3:58:26.700 --> 3:58:34.460]  Um, in fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story, um, we had like, you wouldn't believe
[3:58:34.460 --> 3:58:35.460]  it.
