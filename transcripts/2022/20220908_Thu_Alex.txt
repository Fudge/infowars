[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:02.190]  Yeah, it was, uh, The Matrix attacked me.
[00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.250]  I knew they always would.
[00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.771]  They attacked in a very clever manner.
[00:00:07.271 --> 00:00:12.153]  I received a strike on YouTube, which prevents you from posting for seven days.
[00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:17.334]  After I received the strike, Meta banned me, which is Instagram and Facebook.
[00:00:17.374 --> 00:00:18.054]  They banned me.
[00:00:18.575 --> 00:00:25.777]  I filmed a YouTube video to reply to the ban, while I still had my YouTube account, because they're pretending they're fair and that it all doesn't happen in sync.
[00:00:26.237 --> 00:00:28.898]  They allowed my YouTube account to survive for four more days.
[00:00:29.978 --> 00:00:31.839]  And then they banned my YouTube account.
[00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:44.663]  So the strike was given to me on purpose to make sure that I couldn't post my reply video directly after the first ban and for them to pretend that there was some kind of degree of separation between the large matrix attacks.
[00:00:45.243 --> 00:00:51.485]  I've been banned on basically every single platform from Airbnb to Uber through to social media platforms, payment processors, absolutely everything.
[00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.025]  And you're completely right.
[00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.306]  I teach people.
[00:00:55.206 --> 00:00:57.068]  And inspire people to think for themselves.
[00:00:57.488 --> 00:01:00.650]  And that makes you the enemy of the establishment because you are not allowed to think.
[00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:02.252]  You're only allowed to comply.
[00:01:02.512 --> 00:01:04.013]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:05.174]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[00:01:05.194 --> 00:01:06.475]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:07.856]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to?
[00:01:07.896 --> 00:01:08.676]  And Joe Rogan?
[00:01:08.817 --> 00:01:09.377]  Elon Musk?
[00:01:09.677 --> 00:01:11.539]  You know where they tune in, right?
[00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:14.701]  They tune in right here!
[00:01:15.522 --> 00:01:16.262]  InfoWars.
[00:01:16.622 --> 00:01:17.523]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:01:17.622 --> 00:01:39.382]  today.
[00:01:39.323 --> 00:01:41.123]  All you have to do is check out what I'm saying.
[00:01:41.383 --> 00:01:47.425]  And that's why they run the fake headline against myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere, every day.
[00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:49.906]  Jones admits he's an actor.
[00:01:50.786 --> 00:01:53.167]  Or Tucker Carlson says nobody would take me seriously.
[00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:55.188]  Where did we say that?
[00:01:55.528 --> 00:01:56.228]  We never said that.
[00:01:56.288 --> 00:01:58.569]  They just say we said that.
[00:01:59.867 --> 00:02:00.648]  But where's the clip?
[00:02:00.908 --> 00:02:01.809]  Where's the article?
[00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:02.770]  Where do we say that?
[00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.871]  It doesn't exist.
[00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:08.495]  Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist.
[00:02:08.835 --> 00:02:11.677]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show.
[00:02:11.917 --> 00:02:16.021]  The radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act.
[00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:18.383]  He's actually a performance artist.
[00:02:18.583 --> 00:02:19.844]  He's a performance artist.
[00:02:20.205 --> 00:02:21.366]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[00:02:22.026 --> 00:02:25.589]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid.
[00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:30.413]  And it's all based on the custody battle with my ex-wife five years ago.
[00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:38.259]  And she was trying to put into evidence me dressed up more than a decade before, like the Joker, being sarcastic, saying, take your Prozac, kids.
[00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.600]  Take your illegal drugs, too.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.641]  You'll die.
[00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:41.261]  It's fun.
[00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:43.343]  So people wouldn't take drugs.
[00:02:44.404 --> 00:02:47.825]  And they wanted to enter that in evidence and say, look, he's insane, telling kids to use drugs.
[00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:54.668]  And my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks that's really Jack Nicholson.
[00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:56.969]  So yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander.
[00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:58.570]  Hail Cobra!
[00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.770]  Or Optimus Prime.
[00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.691]  Autobots, let's roll!
[00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:04.612]  Or the Joker, because I can do imitations of them all really good.
[00:03:05.112 --> 00:03:05.792]  Or Darth Vader.
[00:03:06.013 --> 00:03:08.213]  Don't act so surprised, globalist.
[00:03:09.094 --> 00:03:12.175]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[00:03:13.658 --> 00:03:15.039]  Do I really think I'm Barth Vader?
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.460]  No.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.003]  Do I think I'm Optimus Prime, Republic Commander, The Joker?
[00:03:19.063 --> 00:03:19.223]  No.
[00:03:19.524 --> 00:03:26.691]  And clearly, no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire that what I'm saying is what I really think.
[00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:28.853]  No one believes the Babylon Bee.
[00:03:29.193 --> 00:03:31.836]  It's not trying to lie to you, it's being sarcastic.
[00:03:32.156 --> 00:03:33.958]  Buy the Vaccinate Me Elmo doll today.
[00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:35.940]  It's required by the CDC.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.381]  But they play those games.
[00:03:38.442 --> 00:03:40.603]  And that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to.
[00:03:41.083 --> 00:03:49.266]  Even though I tell people, okay, this is a joke, this isn't serious, they clip it out, and they say, no, this is what he really believes.
[00:03:49.887 --> 00:03:51.687]  Every day when I leave work, I do this.
[00:03:52.228 --> 00:03:53.468]  That man's a threat to this country.
[00:03:53.728 --> 00:03:55.809]  And they go, look, he admitted in court he's an actor.
[00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.550]  Well, yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly.
[00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.131]  I was an actor in Waking Life.
[00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:03.312]  I was an actor when I was Cobra Commander.
[00:04:05.513 --> 00:04:13.976]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host, up here reading news articles to you isn't a real thing and isn't something I'm actually saying.
[00:04:13.996 --> 00:04:14.757]  And you know that!
[00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:16.517]  You're insulted right now.
[00:04:16.557 --> 00:04:17.798]  I'm even explaining that to you.
[00:04:18.138 --> 00:04:21.979]  And so am I. But that's who these people are.
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.321]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:28.542]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.450]  I think Alex Jones seems really talented.
[00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.530]  He's smart.
[00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.151]  He's funny as hell.
[00:04:34.171 --> 00:04:35.251]  He's truly funny.
[00:04:35.512 --> 00:04:36.512]  I'm kind of retarded.
[00:04:36.512 --> 00:04:44.512]  [Music]
[00:04:44.512 --> 00:04:51.512]   Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes, do you now not listen to what I say about other things
[00:04:51.512 --> 00:04:56.512]   when I show you a powerful news article by Dr. Joseph Mercola on InfoWars.com?
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.940]  It has all the cited information.
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.921]  The latest tragedy, sudden adult death syndrome.
[00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:03.942]  No, that's a real thing.
[00:05:04.702 --> 00:05:07.123]  That's something happening in the real world.
[00:05:07.803 --> 00:05:09.364]  And that's what we're breaking down here today.
[00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.092]  I am Alex Jones, and I am the guy on this show every day.
[00:05:14.472 --> 00:05:21.191]   I am an American and that's what I promote is freedom and justice and liberty and they can't stand it.
[00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:33.592]  Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.
[00:05:33.592 --> 00:05:35.752]  (roaring)
[00:05:36.026 --> 00:05:38.425]  Get ready folks, it's a live Thursday broadcast.
[00:05:38.425 --> 00:05:48.426]  [MUSIC]
[00:05:48.426 --> 00:05:52.425]   war and say I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight.
[00:05:52.698 --> 00:05:54.861]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:05:56.804 --> 00:06:02.804]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:02.804 --> 00:06:23.804]   Thanks for joining us on this live, teleprompter-free, original, pro-human transmission.
[00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:26.674]  It's Thursday, September 8th, 2022.
[00:06:29.197 --> 00:06:41.250]  And literally ten minutes ago, before the show started, I ended an hour-long interview with now the most man-man in the world, one of the most censored people on the planet, Andrew Tate.
[00:06:42.102 --> 00:06:43.483]  And it was an amazing interview.
[00:06:43.523 --> 00:06:44.303]  He's hosted the show.
[00:06:44.343 --> 00:06:45.343]  He's been a guest many times.
[00:06:45.643 --> 00:06:46.764]  He's come to Austin and visited.
[00:06:46.784 --> 00:06:47.884]  I've gone out to dinner with him and his brother.
[00:06:48.545 --> 00:06:58.568]  He's a really smart guy and they're misrepresenting who he is because they're scared of male leadership and his message of not being depressed and having a destiny.
[00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:06.131]  So I'm going to air some excerpts tomorrow of the interview on the Friday show.
[00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:20.812]   And then Monday, I'm going to Dallas to be on Steven Crowder's show, but the first hour Monday will be the Andrew Tate interview in full.
[00:07:21.112 --> 00:07:28.977]  It'll go into the second hour as well, because we have 15 minutes or 14 minutes of ads an hour, so we're going to try to air a close to hour-long interview.
[00:07:28.997 --> 00:07:29.878]  It'll take more than an hour.
[00:07:30.358 --> 00:07:33.940]  So Monday, Andrew Tate, the big interview, but we're going to have some excerpts.
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.362]  It was an incredible interview that just ended literally, like, you know, about 13, 14 minutes ago.
[00:07:39.547 --> 00:07:42.547]  We're seven and a half minutes into the broadcast right now.
[00:07:42.547 --> 00:07:45.147]  And he knocked it out of the park.
[00:07:45.147 --> 00:07:47.147]   And it's all about victory and how to defeat the new world order.
[00:07:47.147 --> 00:07:48.747]  And it's the essence of victory.
[00:07:48.747 --> 00:07:50.347]  And it's why they're so scared of us.
[00:07:50.347 --> 00:07:55.047]   So we didn't have time to grab any of the best excerpts out because it just ended.
[00:07:55.047 --> 00:07:58.347]   But here is just the first five and a half minutes of the interview.
[00:07:58.347 --> 00:08:00.647]   And then we're going to kick off all this incredible breaking news.
[00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.746]  Stay with us.
[00:08:02.746 --> 00:08:10.347]   Well, I'm known as the most controversial man in America, probably the world,
[00:08:10.347 --> 00:08:13.647]   except now somebody's giving me a really good run for my money.
[00:08:14.187 --> 00:08:15.187]  And he's a good friend of mine.
[00:08:15.227 --> 00:08:16.388]  He's a good friend of Paul Watson.
[00:08:17.108 --> 00:08:17.628]  We've hung out.
[00:08:17.648 --> 00:08:18.549]  He's been on the show many times.
[00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:19.349]  He's hosted the show.
[00:08:19.409 --> 00:08:25.451]  He's Andrew Tate, the most searched individual in the last six months on the Internet every single day.
[00:08:26.012 --> 00:08:39.015]   And he is just on fire with the young people with a really good, strong, pro-human message That completely threatens the power structure because they want us to be weak, they want us to be victims, and Andrew Tate is the opposite.
[00:08:39.035 --> 00:08:44.677]  But what really freaks people out is that their daughters are listening to Andrew Tate.
[00:08:45.278 --> 00:08:50.159]  I was having dinner a few days ago with another good friend of mine that's a well-known podcaster, and he brought up Andrew Tate.
[00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:51.600]  He said, yeah, it's really crazy.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.720]  My daughters are big fans.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.421]  Those are high school daughters.
[00:08:55.461 --> 00:09:08.802]   So Andrew Tate has broken through Absolutely massively and had a gigantic effect and the power structure is insanely scared of him.
[00:09:09.122 --> 00:09:13.205]  Now if he was a bad guy and had this much influence and they didn't control him, they'd be coming after him.
[00:09:13.525 --> 00:09:21.304]   But he's a good guy with incredible pull and that scares them To their very core.
[00:09:21.464 --> 00:09:26.307]  And that's why this hour-long interview, uncensored, is so critical.
[00:09:26.907 --> 00:09:32.910]  Andrew Tate being able to speak for himself, because now he's become one of the most banned men in the world.
[00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.591]  There's only a few other people out there.
[00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:35.692]  Donald Trump is one of them.
[00:09:36.012 --> 00:09:39.794]  I'd say in the top three most banned people in the world, it's Andrew Tate, Alex Jones, and Donald Trump.
[00:09:39.814 --> 00:09:42.236]  That's why this interview is so incredibly important.
[00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:46.298]  We're in a club, it's a pretty elite club, and it's because we scare the establishment.
[00:09:46.578 --> 00:09:48.199]  Andrew Tate, great to have you here, my friend.
[00:09:49.503 --> 00:09:55.713]  Absolutely glad to be here and that's a pretty good club to be part of so I'm almost happy for the membership.
[00:09:57.315 --> 00:09:58.036]  Where to start?
[00:09:58.617 --> 00:09:59.278]  The band?
[00:10:00.701 --> 00:10:01.522]  What you're going through?
[00:10:01.562 --> 00:10:02.263]  What's unfolding?
[00:10:02.303 --> 00:10:02.984]  What's coming next?
[00:10:03.024 --> 00:10:04.026]  We're gonna get into so much here today.
[00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:07.440]  Yeah, it was, uh, The Matrix attacked me.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.481]  I knew they always would.
[00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:12.003]  They attacked in a very clever manner.
[00:10:12.523 --> 00:10:17.386]  I received a strike on YouTube, which prevents you from posting for seven days.
[00:10:18.247 --> 00:10:22.569]  After I received the strike, Meta banned me, which is Instagram and Facebook.
[00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:23.310]  They banned me.
[00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:31.015]  I filmed a YouTube video to reply to the ban, while I still had my YouTube account, because they're pretending they're fair and that it all doesn't happen in sync.
[00:10:31.475 --> 00:10:34.157]  They allowed my YouTube account to survive for four more days.
[00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:37.099]  And then they banned my YouTube account.
[00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:49.910]  So the strike was given to me on purpose to make sure that I couldn't post my reply video directly after the first ban and for them to pretend that there was some kind of degree of separation between the large matrix attacks.
[00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:56.736]  I've been banned on basically every single platform from Airbnb to Uber through to social media platforms, payment processors, absolutely everything.
[00:10:57.336 --> 00:10:58.277]  And you're completely right.
[00:10:58.738 --> 00:10:59.558]  I teach people.
[00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:02.321]  And inspire people to think for themselves.
[00:11:02.722 --> 00:11:05.905]  And that makes you the enemy of the establishment because you are not allowed to think.
[00:11:06.305 --> 00:11:07.487]  You're only allowed to comply.
[00:11:08.908 --> 00:11:17.497]  Let's walk through that because before we started this interview today, you said the most important point is once they silence you, then they can tell whatever lies about you.
[00:11:17.517 --> 00:11:18.859]  You're not just putting a phantom zone.
[00:11:19.259 --> 00:11:20.921]  Now they can misrepresent who you are.
[00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:24.290]  Absolutely, and that's the number one intention, right?
[00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:33.933]  Because when these large companies decide to ban somebody, they also monitor in real time public perception, social media comments and posts, and how people feel about their decision.
[00:11:34.354 --> 00:11:48.739]  So to make sure they don't look tyrannical, after they ban you, they use the media machine to lie about you and paint a narrative that you're the worst person in the world, to try and convince the populace that your ban was actually a good thing, so they can get away with their actions unscathed.
[00:11:49.099 --> 00:11:51.180]  The lies are a very, very important part of their plan.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:58.825]  They're always pre-orchestrated, and they come in hard and fast and heavy across every single mainstream media outlet in real time.
[00:11:59.165 --> 00:12:01.887]  As soon as you've been banned, you can no longer defend yourself.
[00:12:02.107 --> 00:12:02.888]  You are defenseless.
[00:12:03.948 --> 00:12:07.191]  And what you just said is so incredibly critical, and that's why they're scared of you.
[00:12:08.271 --> 00:12:21.272]   When they began their purge of Infowars in August of 2018, Tim Cook later bragged that he met that Sunday night with the heads of the big six tech companies.
[00:12:21.592 --> 00:12:23.013]  That's how important the censorship is.
[00:12:24.014 --> 00:12:25.134]  And it wasn't just about Alex Jones.
[00:12:25.154 --> 00:12:29.497]  It was about setting this precedent and how they first decided to have YouTube shut me down.
[00:12:29.817 --> 00:12:31.458]  First was the strike, so we couldn't respond.
[00:12:31.478 --> 00:12:32.739]  It's all very strategic.
[00:12:32.859 --> 00:12:33.820]  This is admitted, by the way.
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.002]  Cook's given interviews to Vice and you name it.
[00:12:38.223 --> 00:12:51.576]   Then Facebook, Instagram, All of the major sites, over 60 of them, even LinkedIn, then banned me two days after the YouTube strike.
[00:12:51.596 --> 00:12:54.756]  And it was all very, very strategic.
[00:12:55.396 --> 00:12:56.797]  And this is a battle plan.
[00:12:56.817 --> 00:13:01.238]  And they now admit it's a battle plan, which they later used on Donald Trump as well.
[00:13:01.478 --> 00:13:05.298]  And now they're using it against millions of not just Americans, but people all over the world.
[00:13:05.338 --> 00:13:16.403]   And we see the videos in Europe and the UK Where the man criticizes transgenderism and puts up a transgender flag with a swastika on it and they come and arrest the veteran at his home.
[00:13:16.503 --> 00:13:22.446]  So whatever you see being done to Andrew Tate and Alex Jones and Donald Trump today will end up being done to you.
[00:13:22.486 --> 00:13:28.949]  This is a blueprint where they pick out the alpha males that they see on the vanguard because they're really coming after everybody else.
[00:13:32.239 --> 00:13:35.822]  And obviously at the start of the interview I did most of the talking, but he did most of the talking after that.
[00:13:35.882 --> 00:13:37.303]  It was an extremely powerful interview.
[00:13:37.323 --> 00:13:39.806]  That's just the first five and a half minutes of it that we can grab quickly.
[00:13:39.826 --> 00:13:42.768]  I just did the interview before we went live here today.
[00:13:42.908 --> 00:13:43.168]  Okay.
[00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:45.671]  Man, we got big news today.
[00:13:46.611 --> 00:13:48.173]  We have got so much to cover.
[00:13:48.993 --> 00:13:50.014]  So much to go over.
[00:13:50.795 --> 00:13:51.776]  It is just crazy.
[00:13:52.076 --> 00:13:55.839]  And I was watching a Joe Rogan clip this morning at about 6 a.m.
[00:13:56.099 --> 00:13:57.801]  of Eddie Bravo when he was here visiting last week.
[00:13:58.806 --> 00:14:14.801]  Where Eddie brought up something really important I'd forgotten about that is so central, and that's that CNN top producer was caught on tape almost a year ago saying, when we're done with COVID, in comes the climate change, the lockdowns, the energy crisis.
[00:14:15.222 --> 00:14:17.864]  Which again, we knew that, but it's them admitting it.
[00:14:17.984 --> 00:14:21.387]  Where are the congressional investigations?
[00:14:22.148 --> 00:14:48.794]   This stuff is so transparent how the Rockefeller Foundation said we'll use viruses to take over and Bill Gates said that and so did Fauci and then they do it and then this is even more transparent they're admitting how they're going to collapse society and force this into their control under a universal basic income that's controlled and manipulated by the Social credit score and the carbon tax and more which is now being built on the vaccine passport system.
[00:14:49.214 --> 00:14:53.958]  Everything we told you is now here and things just get a hell of a lot worse the longer we stay under it.
[00:14:54.218 --> 00:15:00.062]  The good news is there are rebellions against the New World Order and against the WEF all over the world.
[00:15:00.343 --> 00:15:02.064]  People aren't protesting their governments.
[00:15:02.867 --> 00:15:08.871]  They're protesting the WEF control of their governments from Canada to Brazil, from the United States to Australia.
[00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:10.693]  And it is incredibly exciting.
[00:15:10.733 --> 00:15:13.434]  In fact, there was a couple of members of the Australian Senate and a bunch of others.
[00:15:14.075 --> 00:15:14.575]  I forgot.
[00:15:14.595 --> 00:15:16.216]  I don't see the Bolsonaro clip on here either.
[00:15:17.317 --> 00:15:19.719]  Showing that giant crowd of like 5 million people or more.
[00:15:20.259 --> 00:15:23.722]  I want to show that too when we come back because this is massive.
[00:15:23.782 --> 00:15:25.243]  What is going down is incredible.
[00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:30.734]  We were already supposed to be off air, we were supposed to be neutralized by now, but we weren't.
[00:15:31.174 --> 00:15:41.098]  And we've got several big special guests today, one of them in studio, and Andrew Torba has got some huge news from Gab, the CEO of Gab, coming up the next hour, and we'll take calls as well.
[00:15:41.518 --> 00:15:52.303]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today, InfoWars.com, forward slash show, share that link, the verboten antidote to the New World Order, and Band.Video, Band.Video.
[00:15:54.631 --> 00:15:55.031]  Video.
[00:15:55.551 --> 00:15:55.931]  Band.
[00:15:56.452 --> 00:15:56.672]  Dot.
[00:15:57.192 --> 00:15:58.292]  That's what it's all about!
[00:16:01.153 --> 00:16:02.574]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:02.614 --> 00:16:12.697]  We are broadcasting worldwide from the embattled, battle-hardened InfoWars Complex in ATX, Texas.
[00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:18.399]  Oh, we got a big broadcast today.
[00:16:18.619 --> 00:16:19.279]  Big guest.
[00:16:19.499 --> 00:16:20.120]  Huge news.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.020]  It's just insane.
[00:16:22.659 --> 00:16:25.081]  But I saw a clip this morning when I got up at like 5 a.m.
[00:16:25.141 --> 00:16:54.897]   I was drinking coffee of Eddie Bravo and Joe Rogan when he was here visiting us last week and he made this point to me and Joe at dinner Saturday and I just thought about it at the time but forgot that I was gonna make a big point about that and I hadn't seen the podcast I did a few days before so I didn't realize he talked about it there but And he's like, listen, you got to make a bigger deal about that Project Veritas where that big producer said, after the COVID, the next big scare will be the climate change and all the rest of it.
[00:16:55.438 --> 00:16:55.998]  I'm like, you're right.
[00:16:56.038 --> 00:16:56.498]  That was big.
[00:16:56.538 --> 00:16:57.099]  I need to play that.
[00:16:58.059 --> 00:16:58.720]  Then I forgot about it.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.521]  Then again, this morning, I saw it and it really hit me.
[00:17:03.163 --> 00:17:06.184]  These Project Veritas things come out and each of them is more damning than the last.
[00:17:07.225 --> 00:17:08.446]  And they get censored, they get blocked.
[00:17:10.481 --> 00:17:15.103]  And then now we're living in the future of that prediction coming true, showing it's completely made up.
[00:17:15.343 --> 00:17:16.664]  We're not having record temperatures.
[00:17:17.304 --> 00:17:18.885]  The ice caps are bigger than ever recorded.
[00:17:19.825 --> 00:17:20.446]  That's a fact.
[00:17:21.506 --> 00:17:24.127]  And here they are admitting they know it's a lie.
[00:17:24.567 --> 00:17:26.368]  This is smoking gun information.
[00:17:26.868 --> 00:17:30.430]  So this didn't really go viral when it broke 8, 9, 10 months ago.
[00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:31.090]  How long ago was it?
[00:17:31.931 --> 00:17:36.873]  But it needs to go viral now because it's a big, big deal.
[00:17:40.976 --> 00:17:47.264]  These people are a fraud, and they got a lot of power, and made a lot of money, and hurt a lot of people with their shots, but the world's turning against them.
[00:17:48.405 --> 00:17:51.930]  We've got to break the back of this man-made climate change bull.
[00:17:54.525 --> 00:17:56.186]  Enlisting carbon as evil.
[00:17:56.206 --> 00:18:08.133]  In fact, I want you to play these two clips of first Eddie on Joe Rogan, then the actual Veritas clip, then I want to play Godfrey Bloom in the European Union Parliament in 2009 predicting what this would do.
[00:18:08.193 --> 00:18:15.497]  Let's play, let's play all three of those clips here back to back because they, again, just like my old clips predicting stuff coming true are powerful.
[00:18:15.937 --> 00:18:21.581]  What about CNN confessing to the next stage of fraud and now here we are almost a year later and they're doing it.
[00:18:21.781 --> 00:18:22.121]  Here it is.
[00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:30.838]  I thought once that got out, they were going to pull the plug on the climate change push.
[00:18:30.938 --> 00:18:32.579]  I go, now they can't do it.
[00:18:32.639 --> 00:18:33.139]  Look at these guys.
[00:18:33.159 --> 00:18:33.839]  They busted them.
[00:18:33.859 --> 00:18:35.219]  But they didn't give a shit.
[00:18:35.038 --> 00:18:38.239]   It's real hard, we're just gonna scare everybody with climate change.
[00:18:38.239 --> 00:18:43.858]   I thought once that got out, they were gonna pull the plug on the climate change push.
[00:18:43.858 --> 00:18:45.259]  I go, oh now they can't do it.
[00:18:45.259 --> 00:18:47.057]  Look at these guys, they busted 'em.
[00:18:47.057 --> 00:18:49.578]  But they didn't give a shit, they moved forward.
[00:18:49.578 --> 00:18:52.979]  You know what I'm talking about, that clip?
[00:18:52.493 --> 00:18:54.654]  That CNN clip from Project Veritas?
[00:18:54.954 --> 00:19:01.738]  Yeah, they were saying that that's the next thing that they're going to push really hard, the same way they push COVID.
[00:19:01.798 --> 00:19:11.504]  Look, I don't know any... It's very suspicious that knowing that that's what they're going to push and they're going to push it once COVID's done, they're going to push climate change.
[00:19:11.564 --> 00:19:13.645]  And then you're seeing all this climate change being pushed.
[00:19:13.965 --> 00:19:17.828]  And then you listen to all the people pushing it.
[00:19:19.025 --> 00:19:20.585]  Nothing but demons pushing that shit.
[00:19:21.046 --> 00:19:21.886]  It's the same people.
[00:19:21.926 --> 00:19:23.386]  Listen to all the other shit they're saying.
[00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:29.028]  They're all saying it together, pushing it together, along with all the other bullshit.
[00:19:29.308 --> 00:19:30.248]  So right there, I'm like, okay.
[00:19:30.288 --> 00:19:33.069]  If this story comes up, they're going to latch onto it.
[00:19:33.509 --> 00:19:44.372]  They've already announced in their office that once the public will be open to it, we're going to start focusing mainly on climate.
[00:19:49.321 --> 00:20:05.630]  Climate like global warming and like that's gonna be our next like It's gonna be our focus like like our focus was to get Trump out of office, right?
[00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.591]  Without saying that that's what it was, right?
[00:20:07.991 --> 00:20:11.052]  So our next thing is gonna be for climate change awareness.
[00:20:11.072 --> 00:20:12.073]  What does that look like?
[00:20:12.093 --> 00:20:13.694]  I don't know.
[00:20:13.714 --> 00:20:30.215]   I'm not sure I have a feeling it's just gonna be like He's constantly showing videos of like decline and ice and weather warming up and like the effects of having an economy and really talking to people.
[00:20:30.255 --> 00:20:31.136]  Whose side is that?
[00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:33.637]  The head of the network, like just... Who's that?
[00:20:33.717 --> 00:20:34.377]  Is that Zucker?
[00:20:34.957 --> 00:20:35.698]  Zucker, yeah.
[00:20:35.898 --> 00:20:45.021]  I imagine that he's got his council and they've all like discussed like where they think... So that's like the next...
[00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:47.539]  I don't know.
[00:20:47.358 --> 00:20:53.358]   pandemic like story like that will yeah that will will be to death but that one's got longevity
[00:20:53.358 --> 00:21:00.717]   you know what I mean it's not like there's a definitive ending to the pandemic or you know
[00:21:00.717 --> 00:21:05.688]   like it'll taper off to a point that it's not a problem anymore probably I think it's going to
[00:21:05.688 --> 00:21:10.519]   take years so they'll probably be able to milk that for quite a bit you
[00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:19.038]   know So climate change overload.
[00:21:19.088 --> 00:21:21.110]  Be prepared, it's coming.
[00:21:21.291 --> 00:21:31.103]  Stories, like right now, we have an inside track right now where two stories are going to be pushed.
[00:21:31.463 --> 00:21:35.586]  Climate change is going to be the next moving place to see.
[00:21:35.626 --> 00:21:36.686]  We're going to hold him.
[00:21:36.907 --> 00:21:37.807]  I love it.
[00:21:37.646 --> 00:21:39.646]  We're gonna hone in on that.
[00:21:39.646 --> 00:21:41.646]  I love it.
[00:21:41.646 --> 00:21:43.646]  But that's a fair thing to hope for.
[00:21:43.646 --> 00:21:48.646]  But to commit to that as a network.
[00:21:48.646 --> 00:21:50.646]  You said it's gonna be like the new COVID.
[00:21:50.695 --> 00:22:01.202]  Well, Mr. President, I take the opportunity of wishing the East European cities well in the coming of the very early skiing season and snow and ice that's come there.
[00:22:01.222 --> 00:22:09.527]  What, of course, is indicative of the fact that, as independent science has now confirmed, that the globe is actually cooling and has been cooling since 2002, broadly flat since 1998.
[00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.773]  We're all talking about something here which isn't happening.
[00:22:17.294 --> 00:22:21.038]  I've heard time and time again members here talk of CO2 as a pollutant.
[00:22:21.558 --> 00:22:23.861]  A pollutant is a life-giving natural gas.
[00:22:23.941 --> 00:22:28.166]  It gives me the impression that some of our members haven't had the benefit of a formal education.
[00:22:29.287 --> 00:22:38.189]  Isn't this really just about the state being able to get its hand in ordinary people's trouser pocket to steal yet more tax from them?
[00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:41.390]  Isn't this all about political control?
[00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:45.011]  Isn't all this about politics and big business?
[00:22:45.651 --> 00:22:54.053]  The whole thing's a sham, this bogus hypothesis, this ridiculous nonsense that man-made CO2 is causing global warming.
[00:22:54.453 --> 00:22:58.514]  Enough, please, before we damage irrevocably the global economy.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:09.622]  There you go, that's the truth, and now we're living in the artificial power outages that they ordered the power plant shut down, and then go, oh my gosh, we don't know why there's no power, you can't take showers.
[00:23:10.082 --> 00:23:15.363]  Small businesses, the German head of their economic bureau said, just aren't going to exist anymore, but big ones will get power.
[00:23:16.404 --> 00:23:18.844]  Cold-blooded, naked feudalism.
[00:23:19.825 --> 00:23:24.286]  Cold-blooded, naked siege against the people of this planet.
[00:23:25.646 --> 00:23:26.966]  And you knew it would happen.
[00:23:27.286 --> 00:23:32.298]   Universities across Europe and the US are now saying, no flu shot, No school.
[00:23:32.758 --> 00:23:33.439]  No flu shot.
[00:23:33.459 --> 00:23:37.780]  You gotta wear a mask.
[00:23:38.261 --> 00:23:38.921]  You're a criminal.
[00:23:38.941 --> 00:23:42.622]  You gotta wear the star of David like you're a Jew in Nazi Germany.
[00:23:43.383 --> 00:23:44.043]  That's coming up.
[00:23:45.183 --> 00:23:47.224]  We've also got some of the crime statistics out.
[00:23:48.165 --> 00:23:50.606]  Up 200% in some cities and it's all by design.
[00:23:50.626 --> 00:23:53.527]  Just like open borders, fentanyl, the devalued dollar.
[00:23:53.647 --> 00:23:55.087]  It's total war against us.
[00:23:55.207 --> 00:23:56.448]  Wake up to the new world order.
[00:23:56.728 --> 00:23:57.488]  It's killing us.
[00:23:57.568 --> 00:23:58.389]  It's attacking us.
[00:23:58.889 --> 00:24:01.250]  Share the word about this live broadcast now for victory.
[00:24:02.847 --> 00:24:25.772]   You know, we talk a lot about the different ways the globalists are bringers of death, the ways they are depopulating us, the way they're shutting the food off, the way they're shutting the resources off, the way they're devaluing the currencies and pulling the borders, and then Setting up a police state and then defunding the police so they get full total control over them so they'll bow, while crime rates in some U.S.
[00:24:25.812 --> 00:24:28.193]  cities are up 200%.
[00:24:28.693 --> 00:24:35.855]  Crime on average is up over 50% in just the last 20 months since Joe Biden got into office.
[00:24:37.369 --> 00:24:37.890]  Think about that.
[00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:47.498]  And they've ordered for the FBI systems down to the local levels that get grants, so they comply with the FBI statistical analysis, to not report crime like they did before.
[00:24:47.839 --> 00:24:53.464]  So you better believe, just like on the VAERS, 1 out of 100 people that died from the shot they estimate, it gets reported.
[00:24:54.345 --> 00:24:56.567]  So it's easily 100 times, some say 50 times.
[00:24:56.587 --> 00:24:58.048]  The point is, it's way higher.
[00:24:58.689 --> 00:25:04.546]   So when you're here in Portland at a 200% increase in crime, ladies and gentlemen, It's incredible.
[00:25:04.726 --> 00:25:05.747]  It's much higher than you're hearing.
[00:25:05.947 --> 00:25:07.287]  And by the way, I love black people.
[00:25:08.207 --> 00:25:08.987]  I love white people.
[00:25:09.568 --> 00:25:10.348]  I love brown people.
[00:25:10.408 --> 00:25:10.928]  I love people.
[00:25:11.048 --> 00:25:14.349]  There's such wonderful black people, such wonderful white people.
[00:25:14.709 --> 00:25:16.810]  Klaus Schwab's a really evil, horrible white person.
[00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.710]  Prince Charles is a really evil, horrible black person.
[00:25:20.471 --> 00:25:20.931]  White person.
[00:25:22.471 --> 00:25:27.233]  But you've got racial attacks going on around the U.S.
[00:25:27.773 --> 00:25:29.573]  that used to be 10 to 1 black on white.
[00:25:29.633 --> 00:25:30.974]  Now it's 20 to 1 or higher.
[00:25:31.474 --> 00:25:40.420]   And every day, A white man, a white woman, a white child is kidnapped, raped, tortured, and murdered by crazy racist black people.
[00:25:40.961 --> 00:25:42.323]  And I got a bunch of cases of it today.
[00:25:42.343 --> 00:25:43.886]  We'll be getting to a little bit later.
[00:25:44.106 --> 00:25:45.249]  And I hate covering this stuff.
[00:25:46.095 --> 00:26:03.266]  But the media isolates it, and suppresses it, and then when a crazy white person, and they're out there, a bad white person, goes out there and does something evil, man, it is the top story everywhere, and every white person is guilty, every white person is to blame collectively.
[00:26:03.486 --> 00:26:05.547]  Like if it was a mass shooting, every gun owner is to blame.
[00:26:06.488 --> 00:26:13.505]   When it's horse crap, or when a Muslim runs over somebody, you know, 20 people with a car, Or a hundred people in the case of Nice, France.
[00:26:14.306 --> 00:26:19.086]  You don't blame the bus, you don't blame the truck, you blame who did it, but they try to suppress when the Islamists do that.
[00:26:19.186 --> 00:26:27.248]  So, it's open season on white people by the ruling globalist white New World Order, because they want us all killing each other.
[00:26:27.928 --> 00:26:32.669]  But I have case after case like this crazy new shooting in Atlanta.
[00:26:32.689 --> 00:26:38.170]  I don't even want to air the video of the guy running around just randomly shooting women and you name it.
[00:26:39.793 --> 00:26:48.198]  And then smiling when he gets arrested and is so proud of all the people he just shot.
[00:26:49.258 --> 00:26:52.960]  He'd been let out by George Soros DA after a bunch of crimes he committed.
[00:26:53.361 --> 00:26:58.929]   Then you have this individual in Tennessee They kidnapped the poor white lady teacher.
[00:26:58.949 --> 00:27:01.130]  I don't care if she's black or white, she's a human being.
[00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.171]  Took her, raped her, and tortured her to death.
[00:27:03.431 --> 00:27:05.573]  And because it's black on white, they're suppressing the story.
[00:27:05.893 --> 00:27:10.256]  Can you imagine if a white dude kidnapped a black woman and went and raped and murdered her?
[00:27:10.356 --> 00:27:13.458]  It'd be on every channel, everywhere, and all whites would be to blame.
[00:27:14.598 --> 00:27:16.540]  So that is this division they're pushing.
[00:27:17.861 --> 00:27:21.503]  And the truth is, the real persecution in this country is the unborn.
[00:27:23.817 --> 00:27:31.500]  And it's the exploitation of migrants, and it is the murder and torture and killing of white people.
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:40.683]  Because the media is out there in all these movies and all these TV shows saying that white people are inherently bad, white people are inherently evil, and they deserve to die.
[00:27:40.703 --> 00:27:45.565]  So some sweet little school teacher gets grabbed at gunpoint in Memphis.
[00:27:48.086 --> 00:27:50.847]  Yeah, we'll play her singing to her kindergarten students in a minute.
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.601]  And she gets raped and murdered, and that's okay.
[00:27:55.681 --> 00:27:57.001]  And the media suppresses the story.
[00:27:57.522 --> 00:27:58.562]  It's disgusting.
[00:27:59.022 --> 00:28:02.263]  And when they question these guys, they say, well, she's a white person.
[00:28:02.663 --> 00:28:03.463]  She deserves it.
[00:28:03.963 --> 00:28:09.725]  And I could play you the new Black Panther Party all day long in Houston, and in Chicago, and in Oakland.
[00:28:10.005 --> 00:28:10.726]  I got all the clips.
[00:28:11.166 --> 00:28:14.567]  Hell, I had these guys on before saying, don't mug other black people.
[00:28:14.987 --> 00:28:16.627]  Go out and mug and rob white people.
[00:28:16.867 --> 00:28:18.768]  Hey, how about you don't mug or rob anybody?
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:38.691]  But this is how they're playing us off against each other, and it's disgusting, because it's destructive, and it's what the left wants, and they think black people are stupid, and they are trying to weaponize black people, and there's already a race war going on against white people, and we've got to be smart enough to protect ourselves, no matter what color we are, but to see through this and understand what this is.
[00:28:39.632 --> 00:28:47.737]  White people aren't evil, black people aren't evil, but there are evil and easily controlled, manipulable individuals like these monsters.
[00:28:48.527 --> 00:28:49.568]  Whether they be black or white.
[00:28:50.249 --> 00:29:03.600]  But it's 21 black on white right now, and it's really bad, and it's out of control, because they brainwashed some black males to believe that white people actually are the reason their life's not good, so it's somehow moral to do this type of crap.
[00:29:04.521 --> 00:29:05.061]  Unbelievable.
[00:29:05.422 --> 00:29:07.704]  Here's a clip boiling down some of the latest crime statistics.
[00:29:09.525 --> 00:29:14.069]  Nearly 30 years, crime was falling in the United States.
[00:29:13.928 --> 00:29:14.928]  No more.
[00:29:14.928 --> 00:29:19.928]  [Music]
[00:29:19.928 --> 00:29:22.928]  The national murder rate is at its highest in 20--
[00:29:22.964 --> 00:29:23.744]  Oh my God!
[00:29:26.185 --> 00:29:31.987]  The result of far-left policies that leave innocent Americans at the mercy of violent criminals.
[00:29:32.847 --> 00:29:33.947]  You've seen the images.
[00:29:34.607 --> 00:29:38.028]  Subway riders pushed onto tracks by the violently deranged.
[00:29:38.629 --> 00:29:40.709]  Storms being looted in broad daylight.
[00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:45.471]  Elderly women viciously beaten on the street and outside their homes.
[00:29:46.111 --> 00:29:48.672]  Gang shootings turning cities into war zones.
[00:29:50.018 --> 00:29:52.420]  Hardened criminals rampaging without fear.
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:54.021]  No fear of arrest.
[00:29:54.582 --> 00:29:56.063]  No fear of prosecution.
[00:29:56.443 --> 00:29:57.464]  No fear of jail.
[00:29:58.004 --> 00:29:59.886]  No fear of any consequence at all.
[00:30:00.446 --> 00:30:02.908]  Instead, you are made to live in fear.
[00:30:03.689 --> 00:30:08.152]  Woke progressive prosecutors are releasing dangerous predators before trial.
[00:30:08.733 --> 00:30:13.476]  Woke far-left politicians have allowed our streets and parks to be overrun with crime and drugs.
[00:30:14.357 --> 00:30:18.681]  Police have been made into the enemy, and criminals into a protected class.
[00:30:19.677 --> 00:30:22.439]  Violent crime is up 21% in Washington, D.C.
[00:30:22.459 --> 00:30:26.142]  35% in Chicago.
[00:30:26.162 --> 00:30:27.022]  41% in New York City.
[00:30:27.703 --> 00:30:30.825]  And murders are up 207% in Portland.
[00:30:32.146 --> 00:30:33.127]  Cities in chaos.
[00:30:33.707 --> 00:30:35.328]  Billions in property damages.
[00:30:35.788 --> 00:30:37.790]  Lives and families destroyed.
[00:30:38.791 --> 00:30:40.332]  Stop the woke war on police.
[00:30:40.752 --> 00:30:43.314]  Stop the far-left assault on public safety.
[00:30:44.054 --> 00:30:47.797]  Stop the radical left-wing love affair with criminals.
[00:30:47.857 --> 00:30:49.118]  Stop the insanity.
[00:30:50.948 --> 00:30:53.189]  Citizens for Sanity paid for this ad.
[00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:58.570]  This has all been done by design.
[00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:02.191]  Soros has gotten over a thousand DAs and county attorneys put in.
[00:31:02.211 --> 00:31:05.692]  He's got over 20 of the state attorneys, generals in.
[00:31:07.393 --> 00:31:12.294]  And they are promoting institutional racism against white people.
[00:31:12.894 --> 00:31:15.835]  The latest Project Veritas video, put it back on screen please, I want to read it.
[00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:21.818]  Bust Democrat US Senate candidates saying treat white people like SH-T.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:32.066]  Act however you want, do whatever you want while you serve Klaus Schwab and the New World Order of the 63 million aborted humans in America, half of them are black.
[00:31:32.286 --> 00:31:34.668]  This woman doesn't give a rat's ass about black people.
[00:31:35.208 --> 00:31:37.490]  She didn't care about anybody but her own fat ass.
[00:31:39.331 --> 00:31:45.456]  Here's a couple clips dealing with people dealing with crime and how scared they are, especially in Democrat cities where it's hard to own a gun.
[00:31:46.514 --> 00:31:47.635]  I'm scared to come out my home.
[00:31:47.695 --> 00:31:48.295]  We all are.
[00:31:48.575 --> 00:31:50.036]  When I come out, I have to look around.
[00:31:50.616 --> 00:31:53.178]  I'm noticing, like, if you hear loud noise, you start getting scared.
[00:31:53.598 --> 00:31:54.758]  Who wants to live like that?
[00:31:55.079 --> 00:32:00.902]  Things got rough in Center City Saturday night, with mobs of teens ransacking convenience stores.
[00:32:01.302 --> 00:32:06.265]  And things didn't get any better Sunday, once police say the guns came out.
[00:32:06.625 --> 00:32:10.847]  Suzanne Pileggi says she recently left home with her son's baseball bat.
[00:32:11.067 --> 00:32:18.560]  I'm very concerned lately and when I walk around, I mean one time I took his baseball bat with me just to get water ice.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.686]  You armed yourself with a baseball bat out of concern for your safety.
[00:32:22.421 --> 00:32:22.841]  I did.
[00:32:22.861 --> 00:32:32.808]  What began as nuisance and property crime Saturday escalated to something more serious and dangerous on Sunday as those shots were fired around 10th and Market.
[00:32:33.148 --> 00:32:36.671]  Councilman David Oh pointed to a lack of accountability.
[00:32:36.811 --> 00:32:43.015]  The city has to really reevaluate whatever it was doing, whoever thought this was a good idea.
[00:32:43.375 --> 00:32:44.516]  It's a really bad idea.
[00:32:44.576 --> 00:32:45.777]  It's not worked in the past.
[00:32:46.277 --> 00:32:47.418]  It's not working now.
[00:32:47.838 --> 00:32:48.859]  Swallow your pride.
[00:32:49.119 --> 00:32:52.121]  Get back to providing public safety to the citizens.
[00:32:53.502 --> 00:32:55.663]  Don't bring a baseball bat to a gunfight.
[00:32:57.765 --> 00:32:59.586]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:00.166 --> 00:33:05.450]  And the majority of it is black on white because the media, working for Klaus Schwab, told him to do so.
[00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:09.673]  A crazy old Nazi having the media tell black people go out and kill white folks.
[00:33:10.093 --> 00:33:11.034]  See how you're getting set up?
[00:33:11.234 --> 00:33:11.955]  See where this is going?
[00:33:13.276 --> 00:33:16.518]  All right, I got a lot of other big world news to cover and two huge guests coming up.
[00:33:17.469 --> 00:33:23.232]  And there's also several new reports that the great Harrison Smith and his team have put together.
[00:33:23.252 --> 00:33:26.673]  One of them is titled, If I Worked at CNN.
[00:33:27.154 --> 00:33:31.616]  This is going to premiere here at the start of the next hour that Andrew Torb is on and so much more.
[00:33:32.216 --> 00:33:42.248]   But Rob, one of the producers who just so happens to be black, came in here and reminded me of a great report he did in June Titled, The Brainwashing of White Supremacy.
[00:33:42.668 --> 00:33:44.210]  And again, folks, they're setting us all up.
[00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:46.832]  We're all being targeted for lawlessness and collapse.
[00:33:47.512 --> 00:33:54.077]  And by these major cities, literally these DAs that Soros puts in, letting black people specifically commit crimes.
[00:33:55.578 --> 00:33:56.238]  Specifically.
[00:33:56.258 --> 00:33:58.040]  I mean, I'm talking murder, you name it.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:04.444]  I showed you the Illinois law, where you can be released for second-degree murder after one day in jail.
[00:34:05.385 --> 00:34:06.446]  I know that doesn't sound real.
[00:34:06.826 --> 00:34:07.146]  It's real.
[00:34:08.348 --> 00:34:09.390]  The Safety Act.
[00:34:10.111 --> 00:34:12.314]  So none of this seems real because it's tyranny.
[00:34:12.835 --> 00:34:14.357]  And it's a total plan to bring things down.
[00:34:14.418 --> 00:34:21.108]  So since he mentioned it, let's go to this report that we'll repost on the front page of InfoWars.com.
[00:34:21.188 --> 00:34:32.467]  the brainwashing of white supremacy.
[00:34:32.479 --> 00:34:36.381]  A huge, huge, terrible, bloody game.
[00:34:36.862 --> 00:34:37.242]  Okay?
[00:34:38.523 --> 00:34:41.565]  Of course it would make white people angry.
[00:34:41.845 --> 00:34:42.526]  Of course!
[00:34:42.966 --> 00:34:43.266]  Why?
[00:34:43.546 --> 00:34:47.669]  Because the pigmentation of their skin determines their destiny?
[00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:49.170]  Excuse me?
[00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:56.343]   That is Insane on one hand, but on the other hand, it's a part of a plan!
[00:34:57.084 --> 00:35:01.268]  If you keep pounding people and pushing people, okay?
[00:35:01.528 --> 00:35:06.173]  I'm not saying that there is no racism in this country, of course!
[00:35:06.433 --> 00:35:10.718]  But it's not just in this country, and it's not just on one side!
[00:35:11.445 --> 00:35:17.350]  It is in many countries all over the world, by the way, including Communist China.
[00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:21.754]  I'm not anti-Chinese, but I am anti-tyranny.
[00:35:22.354 --> 00:35:30.200]  I am anti the propaganda that we get that passes for so-called news.
[00:35:30.701 --> 00:35:31.341]  It's not news.
[00:35:31.862 --> 00:35:32.823]  It's propaganda.
[00:35:33.363 --> 00:35:35.545]  And there's a big, big difference.
[00:35:35.805 --> 00:35:43.335]   So I think all of us need to grow the freak up Stand up and understand.
[00:35:43.675 --> 00:35:47.396]  Once we understand, there's very little they can do.
[00:35:47.636 --> 00:35:52.057]  I'll say the most effective way to control people is to what?
[00:35:52.477 --> 00:35:53.757]  Control their minds!
[00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:55.638]  Control how they think.
[00:35:56.098 --> 00:35:59.099]  Make sure that they really don't critically think.
[00:35:59.799 --> 00:36:01.800]  Make sure that they're robots.
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.540]  To be robotic.
[00:36:05.316 --> 00:36:07.559]  You got the vaccine.
[00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:08.821]  They got the vaccine.
[00:36:08.861 --> 00:36:10.503]  We got the vaccine.
[00:36:10.844 --> 00:36:12.406]  We can get back to normal.
[00:36:12.446 --> 00:36:13.607]  Let me inform you.
[00:36:13.627 --> 00:36:15.650]  Let's all get the vaccine.
[00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:17.733]  It's about community immunity.
[00:36:18.374 --> 00:36:19.856]  I'm talking unity for you and me.
[00:36:21.022 --> 00:36:32.914]  You see, this victim mentality is nothing more than a deliberate slave mentality.
[00:36:33.415 --> 00:36:34.456]  Oh, I'm a slave!
[00:36:35.157 --> 00:36:36.258]  I can't do nothing!
[00:36:36.318 --> 00:36:37.059]  I'm a slave!
[00:36:37.159 --> 00:36:38.841]  I gotta depend on Big Brother!
[00:36:39.061 --> 00:36:39.922]  That's insane!
[00:36:40.851 --> 00:36:42.311]  And it's unacceptable.
[00:36:42.591 --> 00:36:43.652]  You're not a slave.
[00:36:44.092 --> 00:37:01.096]  And as we used to say back in the day, in the original Black Panther Party, not this so-called new Black Panther nonsense, but in the original party formed in Oakland, California in 1966, we said all power to the people!
[00:37:01.396 --> 00:37:03.516]  Black, white, brown, red, yellow!
[00:37:03.977 --> 00:37:04.297]  Okay?
[00:37:04.677 --> 00:37:05.377]  Our people!
[00:37:07.146 --> 00:37:11.008]  I hear these fools on TV talking about defund the police and things like that.
[00:37:11.569 --> 00:37:15.031]  We need police reform and prison reform and things like that.
[00:37:15.451 --> 00:37:17.952]  Because you know who ain't gonna defund the cops?
[00:37:18.693 --> 00:37:21.574]  White neighborhoods and rich neighborhoods.
[00:37:21.654 --> 00:37:25.336]  So that notion they keep saying that, I'm like, wait a minute.
[00:37:25.376 --> 00:37:27.638]  Who are black people supposed to call?
[00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:28.258]  Ghostbusters?
[00:37:28.538 --> 00:37:29.979]  And we have crime in our neighborhoods?
[00:37:30.459 --> 00:37:32.020]  We need police reform.
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:36.722]  Like I say, white people, especially rich white people, they're always gonna have cops.
[00:37:36.762 --> 00:37:39.964]  So we need to stop that defund or embolish the cops crap.
[00:37:40.144 --> 00:37:42.145]  This country is doomed.
[00:37:43.406 --> 00:37:54.731]  It is doomed, not just because of African Americans, but because by 2040, this country is going to be minority white European.
[00:37:54.751 --> 00:37:55.592]  You hear me?
[00:37:56.352 --> 00:37:57.933]  Minority white European.
[00:37:58.959 --> 00:38:05.506]  And you guys are going to have to start working more with Hispanics, who will make up a larger portion of the population than you all do.
[00:38:06.351 --> 00:38:08.573]  I'm not no Black Lives Matter supporter.
[00:38:08.813 --> 00:38:09.273]  You're not?
[00:38:09.293 --> 00:38:09.333]  No.
[00:38:09.433 --> 00:38:10.414]  Why not?
[00:38:10.434 --> 00:38:12.876]  Because it's not our movement.
[00:38:12.896 --> 00:38:19.381]  This is a movement that was given to us by, you know, George Soros supporters.
[00:38:19.401 --> 00:38:30.289]  Because they saw how things were going and they didn't want to go back to the 60s where we start having our own organic movement.
[00:38:30.549 --> 00:38:32.851]  So let's give the people the movement that we give.
[00:38:34.027 --> 00:38:37.527]   We'll provide them with leaders and all of this type of stuff.
[00:38:37.527 --> 00:38:39.527]  And, um, yeah.
[00:38:39.527 --> 00:38:41.527]  That's what Black Lives Matter is.
[00:38:41.527 --> 00:38:43.527]  The leaders of Black Lives Matter.
[00:38:43.527 --> 00:38:45.527]  Are there leaders of Black Lives Matter?
[00:38:45.527 --> 00:38:46.527]  Who?
[00:38:46.527 --> 00:38:54.527]   These lesbian women who are trying to incorporate, you know, LG whatever the letters are.
[00:38:54.675 --> 00:38:59.836]  Incorporate those, their concerns into black people's concerns.
[00:38:59.856 --> 00:39:00.976]  Go to the website, look it up.
[00:39:01.776 --> 00:39:04.237]  Google George Soros and Black Lives Matter.
[00:39:04.257 --> 00:39:08.457]  See what comes up.
[00:39:08.497 --> 00:39:10.658]  Powerful report needs 10 million views.
[00:39:10.698 --> 00:39:12.638]  The brainwashing of white supremacy.
[00:39:12.658 --> 00:39:16.179]  We'll have it posted on the live show feed today on the front page of InfoWars.com.
[00:39:16.219 --> 00:39:16.979]  It needs to go viral.
[00:39:17.699 --> 00:39:18.759]  Good job, Rob, putting that out.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:19.320]  Okay.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:20.960]  Let me do this.
[00:39:23.078 --> 00:39:24.339]  Look, you know we're the tip of the spear.
[00:39:24.359 --> 00:39:25.459]  You know we're fighting harder than anybody.
[00:39:25.479 --> 00:39:26.900]  You know we're under attack more than anybody.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:30.241]  You know we're for you no matter what color you are.
[00:39:30.261 --> 00:39:31.002]  We believe in you.
[00:39:31.322 --> 00:39:32.002]  We believe in freedom.
[00:39:32.022 --> 00:39:33.443]  We all got red blood and I love you.
[00:39:34.243 --> 00:39:36.244]  And I can't carry this fight out without your support.
[00:39:37.505 --> 00:39:41.006]  So I want to thank all of you for your support, your prayers, your word of mouth.
[00:39:41.566 --> 00:39:55.467]   I want to encourage you now as the battle gets more and more clear, more and more intense to realize we can win this thing and the Other option, if we don't stand up against it, is hell on earth.
[00:39:56.187 --> 00:40:06.971]  So please, listeners, and I want to thank you for your past support, go to InfoWarsTore.com today and realize we're not funded by George Soros or these big elites.
[00:40:07.551 --> 00:40:08.852]  We're funded by we the people.
[00:40:09.352 --> 00:40:14.994]  We try to make it easy for you to get things that really empower you and your body and your immune system that God gave us.
[00:40:15.995 --> 00:40:19.396]  These are all the highest quality, highest source, very best you're going to get.
[00:40:20.979 --> 00:40:23.860]  And we've got, thank God, the supply chain came back a little bit.
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.540]  We finally got a bunch of the products back in.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:30.841]  Right as we were about to be shut down, right as we started to go bankrupt, we have this amazing product.
[00:40:30.861 --> 00:40:32.581]  A big old juicy bottle of this.
[00:40:33.582 --> 00:40:34.682]  In fact, I want to show TV viewers.
[00:40:34.722 --> 00:40:35.022]  Look at this.
[00:40:35.902 --> 00:40:42.303]  This is the highest quality wheatgrass, flat seed, organic cilantro leaf.
[00:40:42.403 --> 00:40:43.144]  Oh, that's so good.
[00:40:43.764 --> 00:40:50.084]   organic kale leaf, organic guanino sprout, organic alfalfa leaf concentrate,
[00:40:50.084 --> 00:40:52.003]  organic pea fiber, and more.
[00:40:52.003 --> 00:40:54.224]  Look at this, for a TV viewer.
[00:40:54.224 --> 00:40:57.044]  These babies are amongst the very best.
[00:40:57.044 --> 00:41:03.524]   All that power of the seed, when it first sprouts, with all that life in it, just keeps going and going.
[00:41:03.524 --> 00:41:05.044]  It's filled to the very top.
[00:41:05.044 --> 00:41:08.923]   You take a couple of these a day, in the morning or the evening, whenever you want to,
[00:41:08.923 --> 00:41:13.564]   and it does so much for your body, and it funds the information war.
[00:41:13.564 --> 00:41:22.684]   So get your green fiber today for your gut health, and for so much more, at infowarestore.com.
[00:41:22.785 --> 00:41:23.525]  Back in stock.

[00:41:25.306 --> 00:41:26.427]  We wouldn't cut the quality of it.
[00:41:27.608 --> 00:41:30.451]  It's got a lot of sourced ingredients in it.
[00:41:30.471 --> 00:41:31.531]  So we haven't had it for a year.
[00:41:31.692 --> 00:41:32.472]  It's back in stock.
[00:41:32.572 --> 00:41:34.254]  Despite that, we want you to get it and love it.
[00:41:34.274 --> 00:41:36.595]  50% off at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:41:36.414 --> 00:41:41.695]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:41:41.695 --> 00:41:42.695]  We'll take one right now.
[00:41:42.695 --> 00:41:49.295]  Now, we only got a small shipment of this in.
[00:41:49.752 --> 00:41:50.733]  I got it four months ago.
[00:41:50.933 --> 00:41:51.973]  I'm still big.
[00:41:52.013 --> 00:41:57.015]  I'm a big husky guy, but I've lost... I stopped at about 40 pounds because I ran out of my bottle, too.
[00:41:57.695 --> 00:42:10.359]  All the natural enzymes and key cofactors that naturally accelerate your body's metabolic system, that accelerate your body's metabolism, that as you get older, slows down.
[00:42:11.059 --> 00:42:12.980]  And diet force is back in stock.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.302]  We finally got a big shipment of it.
[00:42:15.322 --> 00:42:16.243]  40% off as well.
[00:42:16.644 --> 00:42:20.809]  Diet Force back in stock after we got that first little test run and all the rave reviews.
[00:42:21.209 --> 00:42:23.332]  And then, big fan favorites.
[00:42:25.649 --> 00:42:26.569]  Brainforce Ultra.
[00:42:26.609 --> 00:42:27.770]  Lasts about 5-6 hours.
[00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:32.551]  It's the top of the line, known healthy nootropics that don't give you a crash and aren't bad for you.
[00:42:32.851 --> 00:42:34.852]  I can sell pills all day that'll light your ass up.
[00:42:34.892 --> 00:42:36.372]  You'll feel terrible the next day and are bad for you.
[00:42:36.632 --> 00:42:37.533]  This is good for you.
[00:42:37.833 --> 00:42:39.433]  Clarity, focus, energy.
[00:42:39.893 --> 00:42:40.494]  It's amazing.
[00:42:40.574 --> 00:42:41.414]  It's back in stock.
[00:42:41.894 --> 00:42:44.515]  And it is, ladies and gentlemen, 50% off.
[00:42:44.555 --> 00:42:46.676]  Brainforce Plus, 50% off.
[00:42:47.135 --> 00:42:51.295]  And then finally, Brain Force Ultra is different.
[00:42:51.295 --> 00:42:55.815]  Nobody's got this new tropic.
[00:42:55.815 --> 00:42:59.436]   Most of our stuff is just clones of the highest quality stuff that's out there,
[00:42:59.436 --> 00:43:01.416]  but tweaked a little.
[00:43:01.416 --> 00:43:06.014]   This is a proprietary system that a top developer who didn't want his name mentioned,
[00:43:06.014 --> 00:43:09.735]   obviously, is the attacks came up with, that hits in 10, 15 minutes
[00:43:09.735 --> 00:43:11.615]  and goes away in two to three hours.
[00:43:11.615 --> 00:43:14.835]   So again, if the phone rings and one of my friends wants to go out to dinner
[00:43:14.835 --> 00:43:19.494]   and I'm already tired at seven o'clock at night, I mean, literally this happened Saturday night.
[00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:19.750]  Eddie Bravo goes, hey, me and Joe are going out to dinner.
[00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:20.611]  He wants to go to dinner with us.
[00:43:21.171 --> 00:43:22.572]  I was already super tired, like seven.
[00:43:22.612 --> 00:43:23.173]  I said, really?
[00:43:23.633 --> 00:43:24.714]  But up since five, I said, yeah.
[00:43:25.054 --> 00:43:31.359]  I walked in the kitchen, took a squirt of this underneath my tongue, drank a little bit of iced tea, got in the car, went and hung out with him for three hours.
[00:43:31.699 --> 00:43:34.141]  Felt great, got home, and was able to go to sleep.
[00:43:34.461 --> 00:43:35.382]  It lasted two to three hours.
[00:43:35.762 --> 00:43:41.626]  Brain Force Ultra, back in stock, 25% off, infowarestore.com.
[00:43:41.906 --> 00:43:43.287]  And it funds the tip of the spear in the info war.
[00:43:43.307 --> 00:43:43.948]  Thanks for your support.
[00:43:44.428 --> 00:43:45.269]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:43:46.238 --> 00:43:48.079]  Well, I don't know what will happen now.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:55.665]  We've got some difficult days ahead, but I'm not concerned about that now.
[00:43:55.785 --> 00:43:57.426]  I just want to do God's will.
[00:43:59.007 --> 00:44:02.049]  And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain.
[00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:09.597]   And I've looked over The promised land.
[00:44:09.697 --> 00:44:20.453]  I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land.
[00:44:22.376 --> 00:44:22.997]  We gotta come together.
[00:44:23.914 --> 00:44:28.137]  Whether you believe it or not, you gotta decide whether you have dominion over yourself.
[00:44:28.657 --> 00:44:41.765]  I believe that the majority of the plain people of the United States will, day in and day out, make fewer mistakes in governing themselves than any smaller class or body of men, no matter what their training, will make in trying to govern.
[00:44:42.481 --> 00:44:51.643]  And you gotta decide whether it's God that's gonna have dominion over you, that you get orders from, or whether some other human that's jacked into the evil force is gonna have dominion over you.
[00:44:52.223 --> 00:45:02.925]  What we're talking about now is like a second industrial revolution, but the product this time will not be textiles or machines or vehicles or even weapons.
[00:45:03.265 --> 00:45:06.546]  The product this time will be humans themselves.
[00:45:06.566 --> 00:45:08.726]  Do we want to have a human plan or a post-human plan?
[00:45:09.366 --> 00:45:15.936]  Noval Harari and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates say humans are obsolete, we're scum, because they know we are their competition.
[00:45:16.256 --> 00:45:22.165]  They know that if we go for what we want and what God wants to have, they can't compete with that transmission.
[00:45:22.545 --> 00:45:23.967]  They can't compete with that blueprint.
[00:45:24.208 --> 00:45:25.710]  They can't compete with that architecture.
[00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:28.452]  They can't compete with that master plan.
[00:45:28.972 --> 00:45:29.933]  But I just see it now.
[00:45:30.453 --> 00:45:31.574]  It'll be so clear soon.
[00:45:32.034 --> 00:45:33.835]  Are you pro-human or are you anti-human?
[00:45:34.216 --> 00:45:37.318]  You are the human resistance to this alien takeover.
[00:45:37.738 --> 00:45:45.023]  And again, when I say alien takeover, I don't mean some little tinfoil flying saucer crashing in Roswell from Alpha Centauri.
[00:45:45.563 --> 00:45:51.307]  I'm talking about the transmission in the universe of God's order and God's will.
[00:45:51.407 --> 00:45:55.350]  Or do you choose to serve the agents of death?
[00:45:56.232 --> 00:45:59.093]  And like Martin Luther King said, we're not going to judge them off what color they are.
[00:45:59.774 --> 00:46:04.215]  We're going to judge them off of their character, of their actions and deeds.
[00:46:04.916 --> 00:46:06.856]  So I'm going to say it right now, real clear.
[00:46:07.457 --> 00:46:10.718]  I love everybody, no matter what color your beautiful skin is.
[00:46:11.278 --> 00:46:13.799]  But I care about your heart and your guts and your mind.
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.100]  And you're under attack by these Satanists.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.461]  And they want to kill you!
[00:46:17.481 --> 00:46:19.162]  And they want to kill your children!
[00:46:19.182 --> 00:46:21.823]  And I say we set our differences aside.
[00:46:22.583 --> 00:46:32.028]  And I say we come together and we beat these people and we smash their technocracy and we build the future together and we can do anything with our real diversity.
[00:46:32.668 --> 00:46:34.669]  These enemies tell us all day about diversity.
[00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:38.311]  They mean divided and conquered groups of people separate from each other.
[00:46:38.732 --> 00:46:44.014]  This bill is supported by all of the Democrats, House and Senate.
[00:46:44.795 --> 00:46:46.776]  It's just a filibuster in a way.
[00:46:47.679 --> 00:47:01.448]  So in a way, if you really truly want to honor Dr. King, don't dishonor him by using a congressional custom as an excuse for protecting our democracy.
[00:47:01.508 --> 00:47:11.094]  I tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, and you ain't black, I want unity under a code of freedom.
[00:47:11.738 --> 00:47:12.298]  And liberty.
[00:47:12.718 --> 00:47:13.438]  And justice.
[00:47:13.918 --> 00:47:15.079]  And coming together.
[00:47:15.159 --> 00:47:16.059]  And working together.
[00:47:16.139 --> 00:47:16.939]  And being strong.
[00:47:17.259 --> 00:47:18.779]  And that's what Infowars is.
[00:47:19.099 --> 00:47:23.560]  And that's why the enemies of humanity hate us so much.
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:25.601]  Because we love God!
[00:47:26.281 --> 00:47:27.821]  And God loves humanity!
[00:47:28.661 --> 00:47:31.642]  And I am a human supremacist!
[00:47:32.122 --> 00:47:43.002]  I am a human supremacist!
[00:47:43.068 --> 00:47:47.573]  That term will be the future war with the robots and the AI.
[00:47:47.773 --> 00:47:52.358]  What you're hearing now is the entire future and everything they tried to stop us from doing.
[00:47:52.758 --> 00:47:55.261]  Our supremacy will not end with this planet.
[00:47:55.862 --> 00:47:57.583]  We will keep all the stars.
[00:47:57.603 --> 00:47:58.725]  We will colonize.
[00:47:58.905 --> 00:48:00.727]  We will green dead worlds.
[00:48:01.187 --> 00:48:02.529]  We will go interdimensional.
[00:48:02.729 --> 00:48:04.271]  We will unlock the secrets of the universe.
[00:48:04.531 --> 00:48:07.094]  God has laid them out like Christmas presents for his children.
[00:48:07.414 --> 00:48:18.027]  And I am extremely honored to be in the fulcrum and the heart of the fight to bring our race, the human race, in a race for the future.
[00:48:18.647 --> 00:48:29.235]  And we will break the enemy, we will break the pedophiles, we will break the Satanists, because God already sent his own self down here to show us he could do it!
[00:48:29.836 --> 00:48:33.618]  God would never ask us to go through an obstacle course he wouldn't go through!
[00:48:33.719 --> 00:48:39.108]   And now we're gonna go through what Christ did, and we're gonna go through it, and we're gonna be destroyed, but
[00:48:39.108 --> 00:48:40.719]  reborn on the other side!
[00:48:40.719 --> 00:48:51.719]   We are back live, hour number two of this live Thursday, September 8th, 2022 Global Transmission.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:48:53.661 --> 00:49:00.344]  Andrew Torba of Gab's got big news on multi-fronts at the next level of the fight, joining us coming up next segment.
[00:49:00.765 --> 00:49:04.447]  We also have a special guest I'll surprise you with coming up in the third hour.
[00:49:04.847 --> 00:49:10.310]  And I interviewed Andrew Tate, the most talked about Googled guy the last six months in the world, totally banned.
[00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:13.252]  We did a big hour-long interview this morning that's going to air Monday.
[00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:15.771]  We're at a little excerpt of it in the first hour.
[00:49:16.151 --> 00:49:25.075]  Tomorrow we'll have some excerpts of the interview as well on the Friday show, and then Monday I'm going up to the Stephen Crowder Show, but you'll have the Andrew Tate interview and other stuff I'm going to be taping for Monday's show.
[00:49:25.095 --> 00:49:28.196]  Owen Short will be here with the breaking news as well.
[00:49:29.537 --> 00:49:50.847]   But I wanted to hit some of the other news that's breaking and things that are going on, but the great Harrison Smith and some of his crew, some of his compadres, put together this new little piece called, If I Worked at CNN, a Little Armage, a little farewell, a little bon voyage to Brian Humpty Dumpty Stelter.
[00:49:50.867 --> 00:50:10.759]  You know, it's not always easy being on the outside, being dissident, being scrutinized and judged, not having anybody tell you what to say or when to say it.
[00:50:11.778 --> 00:50:14.240]  Sometimes I wonder, what if I'd chosen an easier path?
[00:50:14.881 --> 00:50:16.182]  A more mainstream path?
[00:50:17.243 --> 00:50:20.286]  What if I worked at CNN?
[00:50:20.506 --> 00:51:00.442]   I'd be a self-made man like Cooper The son of a Vanderbilt I'd feed your bullshit wrapped up in virtue With a steady dose of white guilt If the CIA wrote my headlines And you could take them to the bank Yeah, I would be just like Anderson Cooper With a little less sugar in my tank If I spoke to you with half the truth If I just did what they told me to If I never really meant a word, I
[00:51:04.076 --> 00:51:08.220]  I'd ignore the things I can't explain.
[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:12.063]  Still racism and climate change.
[00:51:12.183 --> 00:51:16.226]  We get it wrong just nine times out of ten.
[00:51:16.286 --> 00:51:18.829]  If I was foreseeing it.
[00:51:18.929 --> 00:51:21.251]  Lie, lie, lie.
[00:51:23.553 --> 00:51:50.948]   *music* Humpty Dumpty?
[00:51:51.028 --> 00:51:54.130]  No, sorry Brian, you're not getting a job at InfoWars.
[00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:56.190]  We don't produce fake news.
[00:51:56.190 --> 00:52:03.190]  Next September I turn 38, don't look a day over 52.
[00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:10.190]   I'd be zoom, zoom, zooming like tubing, set myself up for the low blows.
[00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:17.190]  I'd be lie, lie, lying like lemon, irreplaceable like Cuomo.
[00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:25.190]   If I spoke to you, would have the truth, if I just did what they told me to.
[00:52:14.675 --> 00:52:21.675]   Irreplaceable like hormone If I spoke to you with half the truth
[00:52:21.675 --> 00:52:30.675]   If I just did what they told me to If I never really meant a word I said
[00:52:30.675 --> 00:52:36.675]   If I were to say it again If I'd ignore the things I can't explain
[00:52:36.675 --> 00:52:45.675]   Self-racism and climate change We get it wrong just nine times out of ten
[00:52:45.675 --> 00:52:57.675]   If our words were CNN If our words were CNN
[00:52:57.675 --> 00:53:07.675]   If our words were CNN If our words were CNN
[00:53:07.675 --> 00:53:38.675]   If our words were CNN [Instrumental]
[00:53:38.675 --> 00:53:46.675]   If I spoke to you with half the truth If I just did what they told me to
[00:53:46.675 --> 00:53:53.675]   If I never really meant a word I said If I were to say it again
[00:53:53.675 --> 00:54:01.675]   If I'd ignore the things I can't explain Self-racism and climate change
[00:54:01.675 --> 00:54:09.675]   We get it wrong just nine times out of ten If our words were seeing
[00:54:09.818 --> 00:54:19.506]  Sorry Brian, we didn't hire you, but we did hire Jim Saki.
[00:54:19.365 --> 00:54:26.365]  If I was for seeing it, if I just was for seeing it.
[00:54:26.365 --> 00:54:30.365]  Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.
[00:54:30.365 --> 00:54:33.365]  Sorry Brian, we didn't hire you, but we did hire Jim Saki.
[00:54:33.365 --> 00:54:35.365]  She's mine now.
[00:54:35.365 --> 00:54:40.365]  Well that's fun.
[00:54:41.143 --> 00:54:43.806]  If I worked at CNN, RIP's Establishment Media Pundits.
[00:54:44.086 --> 00:54:44.866]  It's a nice song.
[00:54:45.347 --> 00:54:46.268]  Really good music video.
[00:54:46.288 --> 00:54:47.428]  It's at Infowars.com.
[00:54:48.089 --> 00:54:49.930]  Whatever you do, don't go to Infowars.com.
[00:54:51.111 --> 00:54:54.434]  Fenton on the Dragon and Mark Zuckerberg say, you're a bad American if you do that.
[00:54:54.774 --> 00:54:56.296]  Please don't share that video.
[00:54:56.316 --> 00:54:57.797]  All right, we're gonna get really serious here.
[00:54:57.817 --> 00:55:03.101]  A lot of serious news to hit now, but we gotta have, we gotta have a little bit of fun, don't we?
[00:55:04.462 --> 00:55:06.444]  When Andrew Torba comes on, we're gonna be playing this video.
[00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:12.814]  Google has decided to use InfoWars in their new censorship model as a training aid.
[00:55:13.335 --> 00:55:14.375]  Isn't that sweet?
[00:55:14.876 --> 00:55:26.085]  Google uses InfoWars video to test pre-bunk, pre-crime, pre-thought crime, technique that inculcates, which means indoctrinates, people against misinformation.
[00:55:27.706 --> 00:55:28.707]  It inoculates people.
[00:55:29.568 --> 00:55:30.429]  It inculcates them.
[00:55:30.509 --> 00:55:31.429]  It brainwashes them.
[00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:32.931]  That's coming up.
[00:55:33.591 --> 00:55:34.892]  Oh, isn't that just sweet?
[00:55:35.012 --> 00:55:35.673]  Isn't that just cute?
[00:55:35.693 --> 00:55:36.674]  But I wanted to hit this briefly.
[00:55:37.972 --> 00:55:47.118]  I don't dislike this individual who's the new monkey pox czar, like one death in the US, end of the world, 99% of it gay men.
[00:55:47.158 --> 00:55:49.840]  I don't hate this man because he likes other men.
[00:55:50.781 --> 00:56:09.716]   I hate him because he's all part of this new ruling class where you have to either be a woman or be a homosexual, hold any positions of power, and then Biden's monkeypox czar constantly dresses up and is involved in satanic activities, according to himself, and a bunch of other really gross stuff I'm not going to say on air.
[00:56:10.176 --> 00:56:16.641]  But I started investigating it last night when the story broke yesterday, and I quit investigating very quickly because I didn't want to go down that rabbit hole.
[00:56:17.041 --> 00:56:24.887]  But into satanism, into some really destructive stuff, really hurtful things to his own body, and he's par for the course.
[00:56:26.969 --> 00:56:39.318]   Dr. Dimitri Daszakalos, the director of Joe Biden's National Monkeypox Response Team, held his first press conference Wednesday, but attention online focused on degenerate photos of him in the past.
[00:56:39.798 --> 00:56:46.604]  And again, for a family audience, we're not going to show you this stuff, but he's into things like eating poop.
[00:56:48.026 --> 00:56:52.650]  And here he is, why are we surprised, with a big pentagram, and hailing Satan.
[00:56:54.224 --> 00:56:55.625]  So what a God to follow.
[00:56:55.845 --> 00:56:56.805]  Eat that poop.
[00:56:57.005 --> 00:56:57.945]  So delicious.
[00:56:58.766 --> 00:57:00.266]  And I thought my dog was bad doing it.
[00:57:00.746 --> 00:57:02.207]  So that's where we are.
[00:57:02.247 --> 00:57:06.148]  We're not going to show you any more of that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:06.168 --> 00:57:10.130]  But skulls and pentagrams all over his body.
[00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:11.810]  What a nice person.
[00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:13.531]  And remember, he's par for the course.
[00:57:14.431 --> 00:57:17.472]  These guys call themselves women, like the head of the nuclear waste program.
[00:57:17.772 --> 00:57:20.013]  He says a woman looks like a space alien.
[00:57:21.684 --> 00:57:23.105]  Remember the head of the nuclear waste program?
[00:57:23.445 --> 00:57:24.325]  This is the new woman.
[00:57:24.505 --> 00:57:25.426]  I mean, so much they hate women.
[00:57:25.626 --> 00:57:28.667]  Oh, men are women now and this is what a woman looks like.
[00:57:30.128 --> 00:57:33.969]  And of course he's on websites promoting underage sex with children.
[00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:35.770]  Isn't that surprising?
[00:57:37.151 --> 00:57:41.333]  I'm just completely blown away that he dresses up like Count Dracula.
[00:57:41.353 --> 00:57:41.893]  But look at him here.
[00:57:44.878 --> 00:57:45.598]  Undermine women.
[00:57:45.758 --> 00:57:46.419]  Undermine men.
[00:57:46.839 --> 00:57:50.081]  Say that women are degenerate, gross men.
[00:57:50.681 --> 00:57:52.962]  Say that men are degenerate, gross creatures.
[00:57:55.223 --> 00:57:56.584]  Jack Sprat can eat no fat.
[00:57:56.624 --> 00:57:57.824]  His wife can eat no lean.
[00:57:57.864 --> 00:58:00.205]  Between the two, they lick the platter clean.
[00:58:01.286 --> 00:58:04.987]  Top Biden-stabber-defendant-gay-pedophile-prostitution-website-raided-by-feds.
[00:58:06.928 --> 00:58:10.150]  Disgusting Biden-DOE-higher-defendant-underage-gay-prostitution.
[00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:12.921]  Yeah, drag queen story time.
[00:58:13.441 --> 00:58:15.183]  That's what it's all about.
[00:58:16.264 --> 00:58:18.806]  And that's the people they're putting in charge of everything.
[00:58:19.327 --> 00:58:20.748]  And they're coming for our children.
[00:58:20.988 --> 00:58:21.549]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:22.429 --> 00:58:25.732]  Well, the word is the Queen of England is on death's doorstep.
[00:58:27.133 --> 00:58:29.536]  And I hope she got right with God.
[00:58:32.999 --> 00:58:34.620]  Queen twilight within hours.
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:36.402]  And you know how it works when a world leader dies.
[00:58:37.122 --> 00:58:37.903]  They're always dead.
[00:58:38.303 --> 00:58:39.004]  They tell you later.
[00:58:40.117 --> 00:58:42.699]  That was Franco in Spain, he was dead for three days before they announced it.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.582]  Uh, look, maybe Prince Philip got reincarnated and came back as a deadly virus to kill her.
[00:58:48.663 --> 00:58:51.325]  I mean, he did say that, I don't want to come back and kill 80% of the world population.
[00:58:51.785 --> 00:59:04.034]  I don't wish the old Queenie, who's about as British as a Transylvanian vampire bat, I don't, I don't wish her any, any, any ill will, but man, I am just sick of the royal worship.
[00:59:04.495 --> 00:59:07.437]  Our country was founded in defiance of these people.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:12.161]  And in fairness to her, she's from a German Transylvanian bloodline.
[00:59:12.522 --> 00:59:14.442]  She's like 10% old British bloodline.
[00:59:15.143 --> 00:59:20.025]  It's just disgusting to sit there and watch these people and people worshipping people because of their bloodline.
[00:59:20.385 --> 00:59:21.946]  That is not what freedom is all about.
[00:59:22.006 --> 00:59:23.187]  It's not what America is all about.
[00:59:23.827 --> 00:59:25.588]  Okay, let's go ahead and take phone calls.
[00:59:25.608 --> 00:59:28.709]  Like Martin Luther King said, it's what you stand for, it's what you do.
[00:59:28.729 --> 00:59:31.351]  We're going to open the phones up a little bit later in the hour.
[00:59:32.031 --> 00:59:33.893]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:59:34.053 --> 00:59:39.437]  On any topic you want to discuss, 877-789-2539.
[00:59:39.797 --> 00:59:44.882]  But right now, we're joined by the great Andrew Torba of Gab.
[00:59:45.422 --> 00:59:58.213]  When there was a mass shooting in a Jewish center, and the guy, five minutes before he did it, horrible guy, he put a post on Gab saying he was about to do something bad.
[00:59:59.369 --> 01:00:00.350]  Andrew Torba got blamed.
[01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:01.351]  They tried to ban him.
[01:00:01.391 --> 01:00:02.012]  He survived.
[01:00:02.292 --> 01:00:02.892]  That's sport.
[01:00:03.813 --> 01:00:07.897]  Every time there's a mass shooting, anybody reports on it, they're bad at their alternative media.
[01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:13.322]  But when Facebook showed the mass shooting in Atlanta that just happened, oh, well, that's not their fault, because it's not.
[01:00:14.263 --> 01:00:17.926]  If I call a bomb threat in on my AT&T cell phone, it's not AT&T's fault.
[01:00:18.367 --> 01:00:23.872]  So Andrew Torba's here to talk about his book that's been in the top 10 and the top 100 consistently the last month.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:30.107]  Christian nationalism on Amazon.com, which is the new New York Times bestseller list, because the New York Times rigs their list now.
[01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:36.628]  My book has also been in the top 10 off and on, and on more than 40 charts at the top, so has Andrew's.
[01:00:37.088 --> 01:00:40.711]  So he's been dominating the religious charts and the cultural charts.
[01:00:41.111 --> 01:00:47.676]  We've been dominating the political science and history charts and politics charts, and of course the number one charts as well.
[01:00:47.696 --> 01:00:49.657]  So it just shows how popular Freedom is.
[01:00:49.697 --> 01:00:56.682]  So to talk about his book and so much more is Andrew Torba, another survivor in the ranks with Andrew Tate and others.
[01:00:57.022 --> 01:00:58.003]  Andrew, great to have you here with us.
[01:00:59.113 --> 01:00:59.773]  Pleasure to be here.
[01:00:59.853 --> 01:01:03.556]  As always, Alex, we've been busy building was working on this book.
[01:01:04.036 --> 01:01:08.638]  You and I are both in the top 100 on Amazon's bestseller list right now.
[01:01:09.059 --> 01:01:10.660]  Our book actually comes out tomorrow.
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:12.461]  So we've been doing this through pre-orders.
[01:01:13.081 --> 01:01:40.432]   And like you said, it just shows how popular these ideas are and it shows how big Our movement is I think one of the things that the enemy wants us to believe is that we're isolated or that we're alone or that you know The people that share our values in our worldview are very small in number, but that's actually the opposite is true we make up you know 80 to 90 percent of this country and the elites in DC and in Silicon Valley and in New York City they make up the small percentage of people that are running this country right now and
[01:01:40.732 --> 01:01:43.893]  And their worldview and their values are diametrically opposed to us.
[01:01:44.313 --> 01:01:50.276]  And what we saw happening before we wrote this book was they were trying to subvert this term, Christian nationalism.
[01:01:51.036 --> 01:01:52.537]  What does Christian nationalism mean?
[01:01:52.577 --> 01:01:55.358]  Well, it means you're a Christian and it means that you're a nationalist.
[01:01:55.758 --> 01:01:56.618]  What is a nationalist?
[01:01:56.718 --> 01:01:58.119]  It's someone who loves their neighbor.
[01:01:58.159 --> 01:01:59.539]  It's someone who loves their country.
[01:01:59.559 --> 01:02:02.580]  So, you know, being a Christian nationalist is not a bad thing.
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:15.246]   In fact, you know, during our research of this book, what we found is that prior to the founding of this country in 1776, There were explicitly Christian countries for the first 200 years with the early colonies.
[01:02:15.326 --> 01:02:21.989]  I mean, some of our early states, Virginia, for example, had a state religion of Anglicanism from 1606 to 1830.
[01:02:23.009 --> 01:02:43.573]   Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, North Carolina, all of the early colonies had explicitly Christian state religions, you know, so that the founding, the true founding of this country is explicitly Christian, and that goes into the founding fathers, you know, the Constitution, The Bill of Rights, all of these things were drafted based on a Christian worldview.
[01:02:44.034 --> 01:02:46.215]  And we cannot let them erase our history.
[01:02:46.275 --> 01:02:48.236]  We cannot let them rewrite our history.
[01:02:48.296 --> 01:02:50.697]  We cannot let them demonize us as Christians.
[01:02:51.077 --> 01:02:52.938]  We have to fight to protect our worldview.
[01:02:53.078 --> 01:02:58.341]  And, you know, a lot of people are misinterpreting Christian nationalism as a purely political movement.
[01:02:58.761 --> 01:02:59.161]  It's not.
[01:02:59.221 --> 01:03:03.764]  It's actually a spiritual, cultural, and political movement.
[01:03:03.784 --> 01:03:06.466]  So it's all these things in one.
[01:03:07.126 --> 01:03:10.948]  Let me 100% agree with you from historical research and just common sense.
[01:03:11.008 --> 01:03:15.611]  You are called a white supremacist in the national news, which is total crap.
[01:03:16.391 --> 01:03:21.612]  Because you call for Christian nationalism as if Christianity is a white supremacist.
[01:03:21.712 --> 01:03:27.294]  It's all about unifying humanity under Christ and His Father God and our family together.
[01:03:27.334 --> 01:03:28.274]  And we are the bride.
[01:03:28.854 --> 01:03:29.714]  Christ is the groom.
[01:03:29.734 --> 01:03:34.816]  We marry all of us together into one Christian family to unify and create peace and justice.
[01:03:35.296 --> 01:03:39.526]   African countries that are Christian are incredibly prosperous, those that
[01:03:39.526 --> 01:03:40.164]  aren't collapsed.
[01:03:40.164 --> 01:03:41.445]  Same thing around the world.
[01:03:41.445 --> 01:03:46.325]   Christianity took Europe from literal barbarism, living in caves and huts,
[01:03:46.325 --> 01:03:50.325]  like Africans, to creating spaceships and quantum mechanics.
[01:03:50.325 --> 01:03:55.916]   And the Christian areas of Africa, look at Rwanda, 10% were Christian, they had all the wealth, all the money,
[01:03:55.916 --> 01:04:00.006]   all the science, IQs as high as Europeans, incredible scientists, because
[01:04:00.006 --> 01:04:03.286]   they weren't running around headhunting. Once they got Christ, boom!
[01:04:03.463 --> 01:04:04.123]  They were awesome!
[01:04:04.464 --> 01:04:05.365]  Same thing with white people.
[01:04:05.385 --> 01:04:09.889]  White people were running around eating each other, you know, just a few thousand years ago before Christianity.
[01:04:10.209 --> 01:04:12.732]  So let's... the answer is Jesus, is what you're saying.
[01:04:13.852 --> 01:04:14.813]  Unequivocally, yes.
[01:04:14.893 --> 01:04:17.535]  I mean, Christianity is not a racial supremacist movement.
[01:04:17.575 --> 01:04:22.379]  It's also not, you know, there's not a geographic central location outside of the Kingdom of Heaven.
[01:04:22.419 --> 01:04:32.066]  I think, you know, one of the ways that the enemy is sort of framing this is they're calling it white Christian nationalism, and they're trying to say that only white people can be Christians, which is totally absurd on its face.
[01:04:32.306 --> 01:04:34.428]  You know, the Bible tells us there is neither Jew nor Greek.
[01:04:34.728 --> 01:04:39.752]  We are all united as one in Jesus Christ and our shared faith as brothers and sisters in Christ.
[01:04:39.892 --> 01:04:44.135]  And that threatens the globalists because their whole thing is a cult under their beast system.
[01:04:44.636 --> 01:04:49.539]  So there's the satanic system and there's the Christian system and the whole UN world government's targeting Christianity.
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:51.361]  That tells us how powerful and real it is.
[01:04:52.614 --> 01:04:56.198]  Well, Alex, it's ultimately, I don't have to tell you this, you know, they have a religion.
[01:04:56.258 --> 01:04:57.619]  Their religion is transhumanism.
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:59.481]  They want to transcend humanity.
[01:04:59.541 --> 01:05:03.786]  So, you know, the religion of Christianity is the pro-human movement, right?
[01:05:04.026 --> 01:05:05.428]  It's the pro-human worldview.
[01:05:05.488 --> 01:05:06.869]  It's the pro-humanity worldview.
[01:05:07.189 --> 01:05:09.692]  These people themselves, it's the pro-God worldview, obviously.
[01:05:09.952 --> 01:05:11.614]  These people want to become gods.
[01:05:11.894 --> 01:05:14.317]  They want to transcend humanity and become gods.
[01:05:14.657 --> 01:05:31.387]  And they are anti-human, they are anti-God, they are anti-Christ, and we are presenting an alternative that is the tried and true alternative that made the Western society, the entire West what it is, it made Europe what it is, it made America what it is, and that is Christianity, and that is our shared faith and belief in Jesus Christ.
[01:05:31.827 --> 01:05:32.928]  That's what our book is about.
[01:05:33.188 --> 01:05:34.409]  It's about returning to that.
[01:05:34.449 --> 01:05:38.851]  It's about understanding the historical bedrock of our nation.
[01:05:39.451 --> 01:05:51.297]   It is grounded in Christianity and it's about waking Christians up because I think a lot of Christians are just sleepwalking through history right now and they refuse to get engaged in In public discourse.
[01:05:51.317 --> 01:05:51.737]  That's right.
[01:05:51.757 --> 01:05:55.058]  They don't realize that the churches today are 501c3 and bought off.
[01:05:55.538 --> 01:06:00.880]  Christianity was a religious, spiritual movement that politically took over.
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:03.020]  And yeah, we let people practice their own religion.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:04.061]  We don't make them convert.
[01:06:04.081 --> 01:06:05.901]  We're not Islam, but we're Christian.
[01:06:06.081 --> 01:06:07.121]  And that's what this country is.
[01:06:08.122 --> 01:06:08.542]  That's right.
[01:06:08.562 --> 01:06:10.262]  And we need to be Christians all the time.
[01:06:10.442 --> 01:06:12.583]  Not, you know, not just in church, but all day, every day.
[01:06:12.623 --> 01:06:14.563]  And that's, that's what we're trying to convey in this book.
[01:06:14.703 --> 01:06:15.363]  Powerful.
[01:06:15.403 --> 01:06:16.404]  Can't wait to read the book.
[01:06:16.484 --> 01:06:17.704]  Andrew Torba, stay there.
[01:06:18.536 --> 01:06:21.739]  Let's talk about what Christian nationalism means and how it's the antidote to Satanism.
[01:06:22.359 --> 01:06:23.660]  It becomes so much clearer every day.
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:24.801]  The Democrats are Satanists.
[01:06:24.841 --> 01:06:25.602]  We are Christians.
[01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:28.885]  Shoes aside, we're in an information war.
[01:06:30.706 --> 01:06:34.069]  And wars are about will and ideas and action.
[01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:41.095]  And in a fight against tyranny, a book like The Great Reset and the war for the world is a key munition in that fight.
[01:06:42.096 --> 01:06:45.178]  Yeah, we make more money on everybody at Infowarshore.com and thanks for doing that.
[01:06:45.198 --> 01:06:46.099]  It's really kept us on air.
[01:06:46.399 --> 01:06:52.091]   We'd be in the Red right now, if it wasn't for you guys buying 20,000 of these in the last month.
[01:06:52.751 --> 01:06:53.491]  Thank you so much.
[01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:54.632]  In fact, we're basically out.
[01:06:54.952 --> 01:06:55.792]  We're coming in in a week.
[01:06:55.812 --> 01:06:58.152]  About another 10,000 for the publisher.
[01:06:59.753 --> 01:07:06.655]  And yeah, when I sell one on Amazon, or they do, I might get a couple bucks instead of getting, you know, five, six, seven, ten bucks when we sell it at InfoWarsware.com.
[01:07:06.675 --> 01:07:12.376]  But I want you to get it at Amazon.com because we've gone to number five.
[01:07:14.116 --> 01:07:15.437]  I was saying number six.
[01:07:15.737 --> 01:07:16.697]  We went to number five once.
[01:07:17.418 --> 01:07:21.544]  If it goes to number one, it has a lensing effect, an amplifying effect, and everybody gets it.
[01:07:21.584 --> 01:07:22.426]  Same thing with Andrew Torbas.
[01:07:22.446 --> 01:07:24.849]  His has been in the top ten as well in pre-order.
[01:07:24.949 --> 01:07:25.951]  Ours just came out a week ago.
[01:07:26.011 --> 01:07:26.592]  It's now shipping.
[01:07:27.884 --> 01:07:29.225]  His has been in the top 10 as well.
[01:07:29.485 --> 01:07:30.926]  Christian nationalism.
[01:07:31.166 --> 01:07:32.247]  Oh, the key to everything.
[01:07:32.788 --> 01:07:34.229]  And people are hungry for it.
[01:07:34.289 --> 01:07:35.249]  Let's send it to number one.
[01:07:35.269 --> 01:07:37.691]  In fact, I'd be happy if his went to number one and not ours.
[01:07:38.292 --> 01:07:41.414]  All I care about is the culture war because that's the future.
[01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:42.014]  It's everything.
[01:07:42.555 --> 01:07:49.099]  Money and power and shows are only about projecting resistance to tyranny and defending our families.
[01:07:49.219 --> 01:07:50.100]  That's what I want.
[01:07:51.421 --> 01:07:55.804]  Not to go be part of the establishment or, you know, go to white tie events.
[01:07:55.824 --> 01:07:56.785]  Everybody kiss your ass.
[01:07:57.697 --> 01:08:02.820]  So Andrew Torba, Andrew Torba and the new... Say that again?
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:03.600]  You're popping in my head.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.421]  The Queen died, okay.
[01:08:06.101 --> 01:08:08.522]  I told them to tell me when the Queen died.
[01:08:08.582 --> 01:08:09.663]  Let's put that on screen.
[01:08:10.924 --> 01:08:13.985]  Her Royal Majesty, you can see Drudge Report right there, let's click on it.
[01:08:14.145 --> 01:08:14.986]  Big siren there.
[01:08:15.546 --> 01:08:17.067]  Her Royal Majesty.
[01:08:17.807 --> 01:08:19.508]  Her husband died, what, a year ago?
[01:08:20.448 --> 01:08:26.167]   Prince Philip, the former co-head of the Bilderberg Group with Prince Bernhard,
[01:08:26.167 --> 01:08:35.168]   and the Queen of England has made the jump into hyperspace, and it's now bye-bye time.
[01:08:35.168 --> 01:08:39.646]   Her uncle was a top Nazi, Edward VIII, who was the King of England,
[01:08:39.646 --> 01:08:46.048]   was going to serve Hitler with the European Union, but they chose to be anti-Hitler.
[01:08:46.048 --> 01:08:54.847]   And her husband, Prince Philip, said he wanted to come back as a particularly deadly virus and be reincarnated
[01:08:54.847 --> 01:08:57.768]  to contribute to depopulation.
[01:08:57.768 --> 01:09:01.008]  And I just hope that he didn't get his wish.
[01:09:01.008 --> 01:09:03.847]  I hope, because I love the Queen so much.
[01:09:03.847 --> 01:09:08.048]  I hope Prince Philip didn't kill the Queen.
[01:09:08.048 --> 01:09:10.167]  That's really what I'm hoping right now.
[01:09:10.167 --> 01:09:17.328]   But would that be a turn of fate, that he was reincarnated as a particularly deadly virus?
[01:09:17.335 --> 01:09:18.015]  Guys, pull the quote up.
[01:09:18.055 --> 01:09:20.137]  Prince Philip reincarnated as a deadly virus.
[01:09:20.517 --> 01:09:22.079]  He told the Audubon Society that.
[01:09:22.199 --> 01:09:24.420]  He told Deutsche Agentur that.
[01:09:25.021 --> 01:09:26.162]  And he told Reuters that.
[01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:33.287]  There's three interviews where he said he wanted to come back as a virus to lower population.
[01:09:33.608 --> 01:09:34.408]  I hope.
[01:09:34.428 --> 01:09:36.730]  Because he said he wanted to come back and kill people.
[01:09:37.811 --> 01:09:38.732]  That's his wish, not mine.
[01:09:39.733 --> 01:09:43.836]  I hope that Prince Philip didn't get his wish.
[01:09:46.050 --> 01:09:48.891]  So, back to Andrew Torba.
[01:09:48.911 --> 01:09:51.192]  Andrew, do you have anything to say about the Queen?
[01:09:52.393 --> 01:09:54.674]  Queen Elizabeth II making the jump into hyperspace?
[01:09:55.815 --> 01:09:58.056]  I hope she knew Jesus Christ as her Lord and Savior.
[01:09:58.176 --> 01:09:58.856]  That's what I'll say.
[01:09:59.545 --> 01:10:01.306]  You know, it's unfortunate.
[01:10:01.367 --> 01:10:02.748]  There's so much going on now.
[01:10:03.728 --> 01:10:05.450]  But she lived a pretty long life.
[01:10:06.791 --> 01:10:10.013]  And you know, again, I just hope that she knew Jesus Christ is her Lord and Savior.
[01:10:10.033 --> 01:10:12.635]  That's the most important decision that you can make in your life.
[01:10:13.256 --> 01:10:16.899]  And it's a decision that I hope a lot of people are taking seriously now.
[01:10:17.699 --> 01:10:19.281]  There's so much fear in our world.
[01:10:19.321 --> 01:10:20.842]  There's so much uncertainty.
[01:10:20.862 --> 01:10:31.371]  You know, this Biden speech trying to categorize, you know, 81 million people as extremists for daring to dissent against the status quo of the mainstream.
[01:10:32.072 --> 01:10:48.682]   But we have to remember again that we're not alone and that, you know, our worldview and that our belief and our faith has stood the test of time and Christians have faced persecution for You know, thousands of years since Christ ascended into heaven, and it's something that we're going to continue to face.
[01:10:49.102 --> 01:10:55.044]  But we have to push through, we have to keep the faith, and we have to have our faith stronger now than ever before.
[01:10:55.064 --> 01:10:56.344]  No, I totally agree with you.
[01:10:56.364 --> 01:11:04.646]  Of course the big question is, will it be Prince Edward that becomes the new king?
[01:11:04.666 --> 01:11:07.766]  Or will he not be bypassed?
[01:11:08.607 --> 01:11:11.590]   Or will it go to Prince Charles.
[01:11:11.610 --> 01:11:16.433]  Because, I mean, Prince Charles is Mr. Reset, New World Order, world government.
[01:11:17.313 --> 01:11:21.356]  I'm predicting right now they're not going to bypass Prince Charles.
[01:11:21.596 --> 01:11:26.740]  I'm making a prediction right now, I may be wrong, but I think Prince Charles is going to be seated as the King of England.
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:29.882]  He'll say something like, for two years while his son gets ready.
[01:11:30.422 --> 01:11:36.006]  I predict Prince Charles will be seated as the King of England and will fly the dragon flag against humanity.
[01:11:39.173 --> 01:11:40.113]  Yeah, we'll have to see.
[01:11:40.153 --> 01:11:43.234]  I mean, you know, there's so much in motion right now.
[01:11:43.334 --> 01:11:46.515]  It's sort of like we're, it feels like we're transitioning, right?
[01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:55.618]  We're transitioning into sort of a new age and the old power structures are sort of going away and new power structures are coming in with this world economic forum.
[01:11:55.658 --> 01:11:58.358]  I mean, everything that you talk about in your book, right?
[01:11:59.019 --> 01:12:01.439]  You know, so we have to be prepared and we have to know our enemy.
[01:12:01.499 --> 01:12:06.821]  And the big thing that I've been talking about, and I know that you've been covering for years as well, is transhumanism.
[01:12:07.141 --> 01:12:13.982]   Because again, You know, they do want to reduce the population, and they do want to become gods by transcending our human biology.
[01:12:14.002 --> 01:12:16.562]  I think it's so important to be talking about this stuff.
[01:12:18.183 --> 01:12:19.623]  Well, ding-dong!
[01:12:19.643 --> 01:12:23.484]  You know that song from, uh, Wizard of Oz?
[01:12:24.224 --> 01:12:25.644]  From the house lands on the witch?
[01:12:28.384 --> 01:12:29.005]  Yes, yes.
[01:12:29.885 --> 01:12:30.385]  How's it go?
[01:12:31.605 --> 01:12:32.685]  Ding-dong, the witch is dead.
[01:12:33.165 --> 01:12:34.886]  The witch-o-witch, the witch-o-witch.
[01:12:35.026 --> 01:12:37.166]  Ding-dong, the wicked witch is dead!
[01:12:38.146 --> 01:12:39.611]  And I'm not saying she was a wicked witch.
[01:12:40.052 --> 01:12:43.523]  Her husband, though, was definitely a depopulationist and a bad guy.
[01:12:43.564 --> 01:12:44.005]  What do you think?
[01:12:45.774 --> 01:12:46.574]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:12:46.594 --> 01:12:49.235]  I mean, that quote, I mean, that's been widely circulated for a while.
[01:12:49.255 --> 01:12:50.595]  I mean, this is what they all believe.
[01:12:50.635 --> 01:12:51.975]  This is what Bill Gates believes.
[01:12:52.816 --> 01:12:55.536]  You know, this is what all the transhumanists believe.
[01:12:55.956 --> 01:13:00.677]  They want to reduce the size of the population, and they want to become gods.
[01:13:00.697 --> 01:13:03.338]  They want to transcend human biology to become gods.
[01:13:03.418 --> 01:13:12.960]  And, you know, we have to present their worldview as it is, and we have to present our counter worldview as the solution to that, which is we are pro-God.
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:14.981]  We don't want to become gods ourselves.
[01:13:15.422 --> 01:13:16.582]  We are pro-humanity.
[01:13:16.622 --> 01:13:17.503]  We are pro-life.
[01:13:18.484 --> 01:13:21.986]  And, you know, that's the way forward, is we have to remind people of that.
[01:13:22.026 --> 01:13:25.608]  We have to remind people of who we are and what we believe and what our worldviews are.
[01:13:25.648 --> 01:13:28.010]  And that's what we're trying to do here with our book.
[01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:32.393]  And I know that's what you're trying to do with your book, as well, is expose how these people think and what their plans are.
[01:13:33.674 --> 01:13:34.894]  Well, you're one of the survivors.
[01:13:34.935 --> 01:13:36.936]  Tell us about all the new features Gab's been adding.
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:42.584]  Yeah, so we just came out with Gab Pay, which is our PayPal alternative.
[01:13:42.664 --> 01:13:47.308]  Not too long ago, we came out with Gab Voice, which is our Zoom alternative.
[01:13:47.368 --> 01:13:51.952]  So, you know, Gab has evolved, you know, beyond just being a social networking alternative.
[01:13:52.173 --> 01:14:04.099]   And we really have a whole suite of Parallel Internet products, really, you know, we're trying to be the Silicon Valley alternative, not just, you know, the Facebook alternative or the Twitter alternative.
[01:14:04.139 --> 01:14:05.739]  It's sort of evolved beyond that.
[01:14:05.799 --> 01:14:09.421]  And, you know, as you said, we were the most resilient all tech platform.
[01:14:09.461 --> 01:14:10.801]  We have our own servers.
[01:14:10.841 --> 01:14:13.242]  We have our own payment processor now.
[01:14:14.089 --> 01:14:19.093]  We've had to build our own email systems, our own social network, everything over the past six years.
[01:14:19.613 --> 01:14:22.115]  By the grace of God, we did it and we're still standing.
[01:14:22.255 --> 01:14:28.259]  Well, great job to your doggedness and your great tech crew and the supporters that stood with you.
[01:14:28.279 --> 01:14:29.119]  That's why we're still here.
[01:14:29.159 --> 01:14:29.980]  That's why you're still there.
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:31.361]  Bravo to listeners and viewers.
[01:14:31.741 --> 01:14:35.524]  I wonder if Jimmy Savelle is going to be attending the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.
[01:14:38.283 --> 01:14:39.984]  Yeah, that'll be interesting to see.
[01:14:40.485 --> 01:14:49.692]  You know, of course, this is going to be the news cycle here for the next week, so I wonder what's going to be happening behind the scenes as all their focus and all of our attention is on this now.
[01:14:49.752 --> 01:14:51.354]  That's usually when they make major moves.
[01:14:52.935 --> 01:14:55.117]  I wonder what King Charles the what he's going to be.
[01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:57.138]  Man, there's got to be like 15 King Charleses.
[01:14:57.779 --> 01:15:02.042]  You know, like King Charles, King... Oh, look at these guys.
[01:15:02.082 --> 01:15:02.903]  Oh, very nice people.
[01:15:05.097 --> 01:15:13.025]  You know, they found a sex dungeon for torturing kids at Jimmy Savelle's house, just as children are said, and he admittedly had sex with dead children at the hospital.
[01:15:13.526 --> 01:15:14.647]  That's pretty liberal though, right?
[01:15:15.928 --> 01:15:16.188]  Sick.
[01:15:16.248 --> 01:15:17.390]  These people are sick, Alex.
[01:15:17.530 --> 01:15:21.994]  You know, we have to pray for reformation and for revival.
[01:15:22.834 --> 01:15:25.216]  And like you said earlier, you know, Christ is the only way forward.
[01:15:25.257 --> 01:15:26.398]  It's the only way out of this mess.
[01:15:27.619 --> 01:15:30.701]  He's always been the only way, and he will continue to be the only way.
[01:15:30.902 --> 01:15:35.446]  And our circumstances today are no different than they have been for the past 2,000 years.
[01:15:37.167 --> 01:15:39.870]  God save our Queen!
[01:15:41.403 --> 01:15:51.350]  The royalty, the splendor, the majesty, the power of the royalty.
[01:15:52.231 --> 01:15:54.993]  If you're an American, you don't like British royalty.
[01:15:55.013 --> 01:15:57.034]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:15:57.054 --> 01:15:57.434]  Stay with us.
[01:15:58.575 --> 01:16:02.718]  Let the joyous news be spread, the wicked old witch at last is dead.
[01:16:06.708 --> 01:16:31.708]  [Music]
[01:16:31.708 --> 01:16:38.898]   Some people are celebrating Elizabeth the second dying, but it's now being reported, as I told you, as I predicted,
[01:16:38.898 --> 01:16:46.708]   King Charles the third of the Saxe-Coburg dynasty, ladies and gentlemen, will be the king of England.
[01:16:47.398 --> 01:16:51.301]  He wants world government, a military operation to cut off carbon and starve you to death.
[01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:55.864]  So if you thought Queen Elizabeth was bad, prepare yourself.
[01:16:57.704 --> 01:16:58.704]  Prepare yourself!
[01:16:58.704 --> 01:17:16.704]   I welcome you most legally, but we've got to verify it legally to see if she is morally,
[01:17:16.704 --> 01:17:24.704]   ethically, spiritually, physically, positively, absolutely, undeniably, and reliably dead.
[01:17:24.704 --> 01:17:41.704]   As coroner, I must hover, I thoroughly examined her, and she's not only merely dead, she's
[01:17:41.704 --> 01:17:44.704]  really most sincerely dead.
[01:17:44.704 --> 01:17:46.704]  [music]
[01:17:46.704 --> 01:17:47.704]  [thud]
[01:17:47.914 --> 01:17:54.037]  But here comes Prince Charles III, now King of England!
[01:17:54.057 --> 01:17:55.078]  Ah, the throne!
[01:17:55.118 --> 01:17:56.898]  Prince is now King!
[01:17:56.738 --> 01:18:03.738]  [Music]
[01:18:03.738 --> 01:18:06.738]  Here comes Prince Charles the Third, now King of England.
[01:18:06.738 --> 01:18:09.738]  [Music]
[01:18:09.738 --> 01:18:11.738]  Ah, the throne.
[01:18:11.738 --> 01:18:16.738]  Prince is now King. Dracula of the House of the Dragon.
[01:18:17.127 --> 01:18:23.127]   When they fly the dragon flag, it means no quarter, but annihilation and death on a planetary scale.
[01:18:23.127 --> 01:18:40.127]  [Music]
[01:18:40.127 --> 01:18:41.127]  Enough of the fanfare.
[01:18:41.207 --> 01:18:45.108]  I'm very sad for the Queen of England, and I hope that she found Jesus, and I don't think she's the Wicked Witch.
[01:18:45.729 --> 01:18:50.731]  Because compared to the rest of her family, she was good in that best house in the bad neighborhood.
[01:18:51.552 --> 01:18:54.413]  But the Queen of England dead, big deal, everybody's gonna worship it.
[01:18:54.873 --> 01:19:01.457]  All these women follow Disney and the whole princess cosmology, and women think it's so cool and so neat, it's disgusting.
[01:19:01.817 --> 01:19:03.998]  The institution of royalty, but that's my view.
[01:19:04.378 --> 01:19:06.159]  I'm not a royalist, I'm an American.
[01:19:07.679 --> 01:19:09.040]  I'm a 1776-er.
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:25.171]  But that said, everybody better get ready because we got King Charles III and his consort, his handmaiden, his... What's the term they use for that?
[01:19:26.672 --> 01:19:27.533]  His concubine.
[01:19:30.375 --> 01:19:32.336]  That is Jimmy Savelle in the New World Order.
[01:19:33.076 --> 01:19:35.138]  Now we're gonna get to stare that down.
[01:19:35.954 --> 01:19:43.657]  At this key point with the powerful New World Order and the British globalist empire that is at the heart of this entire system that we face.
[01:19:44.678 --> 01:19:45.678]  Ding-dong!
[01:19:46.579 --> 01:19:51.220]  When I was talking about that, I wasn't playing ding-dong the witch is dead about Queen Elizabeth II.
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.481]  I was talking about Hillary Clinton!
[01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:54.442]  I forgot to mention this yesterday.
[01:19:54.842 --> 01:19:59.224]  Hillary has officially said she's not running for president for a third time in 2024.
[01:19:59.304 --> 01:20:01.825]  We put that on screen.
[01:20:02.907 --> 01:20:07.290]  Now that means she's gonna run, because if she tells you she's not gonna run, you know she's gonna run.
[01:20:07.851 --> 01:20:12.374]  Except she's got incredibly bad health problems and the rest of it, so maybe it's true.
[01:20:13.115 --> 01:20:20.500]  Her expiration date was up a long time ago, but she's not just rotten milk, she is like yogurt at this point.
[01:20:21.381 --> 01:20:26.845]  So I never speak ill of the dead, and I'm very sorry to everybody.
[01:20:28.214 --> 01:20:29.975]  Over in the UK for losing your Queen.
[01:20:30.555 --> 01:20:33.196]  And you know, they demonize the nation state.
[01:20:33.216 --> 01:20:34.976]  People think of the Queen as the nation state.
[01:20:35.497 --> 01:20:37.537]  And not even Nigel Farage supports the monarchy.
[01:20:39.198 --> 01:20:46.400]  And I know that some of our crew have been invited and hung around with the royals.
[01:20:47.361 --> 01:20:49.882]  So there's a certain thing about being invited to the palace.
[01:20:51.042 --> 01:20:53.843]  And then you kind of get on board with them and believe in a royalist view.
[01:20:53.863 --> 01:20:58.800]   But at the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, The British royal family is not British.
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:02.101]  They've run that whole country into the ground.
[01:21:02.141 --> 01:21:11.006]  So you get a new Prime Minister, we're told two days ago, and within 48 hours, the Queen of England's dead.
[01:21:11.606 --> 01:21:13.847]  Big things going on.
[01:21:14.693 --> 01:21:22.736]  But ding-dong, the witch is dead, the witch-o-witch, the witch-o-witch, ding-dong, the wicked witch is dead, and I'm talking about Hillary politically, not violently.
[01:21:23.336 --> 01:21:25.177]  I don't want any harm to come to Hillary's head.
[01:21:25.517 --> 01:21:44.792]   I'm saying politically, she has announced her own demise, and that her political career is dead as a coffin, dead as a cemetery, dead as a doornail, dead as Count Dracula, dead as dead Can get.
[01:21:44.812 --> 01:21:50.357]  So we're going to continue to cover this as it unfolds.
[01:21:52.839 --> 01:22:03.508]  You better believe, as Andrew Twerba said, this is all we're going to hear for the next month.
[01:22:04.409 --> 01:22:06.730]  I mean, John McCain was like a seven-day event.
[01:22:07.131 --> 01:22:17.476]   George Herbert Walker Bush was like a two-week event of multiple funerals and trains and and just in low oh my god the pomp the circumstance it must
[01:22:17.476 --> 01:22:22.557]   be important they're doing all this well the queen of england just found out that death is the
[01:22:22.557 --> 01:22:29.247]   great equalizer and that everybody's going to face their creator and i hope she was right with jesus
[01:22:29.247 --> 01:22:34.987]   queen elizabeth the second britain's longest serving monarch has died the queen's
[01:22:34.987 --> 01:22:41.858]   decline has sent britain into chaos it will get much worse yes it's not the energy cuts it's not
[01:22:41.858 --> 01:22:44.324]   the great reset that did it It's her decline.
[01:22:44.524 --> 01:22:47.125]  She was holding up the country.
[01:22:48.906 --> 01:22:49.926]  And poll.
[01:22:50.506 --> 01:22:53.307]  Almost a quarter of Democrats believe men can get pregnant.
[01:22:54.387 --> 01:22:57.368]  Mental illness and anti-science and propaganda.
[01:22:57.588 --> 01:23:02.590]  Here's the Democratic Party that want to be all the fact checkers and pre-control what you can say and what you can do.
[01:23:06.610 --> 01:23:08.351]  But they believe men can have babies.
[01:23:08.371 --> 01:23:10.633]  They'll say, two women had babies in a prison.
[01:23:10.933 --> 01:23:12.994]  Yes, two women had babies together.
[01:23:13.995 --> 01:23:18.758]  And they sit there and gaslight us with this insane level of propaganda.
[01:23:19.098 --> 01:23:22.160]  And we're supposed to just sit there and buy it and say, okay, you're the authority.
[01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:22.920]  I'll do whatever you say.
[01:23:22.961 --> 01:23:24.201]  Just don't call me a white supremacist.
[01:23:24.762 --> 01:23:27.503]  This is all a giant, disgusting joke.
[01:23:28.686 --> 01:23:31.828]  The New World Order and the Royals and all of them know they're coming down.
[01:23:32.129 --> 01:23:33.229]  They know they're going down.
[01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:37.873]  And that's why they're trying to bring down civilization with the Great Reset.
[01:23:38.233 --> 01:23:41.375]  Because, as Helper Skelter says, let's come back in with that next segment.
[01:23:43.957 --> 01:23:45.838]  Coming down fast, but I'm miles above you.
[01:23:46.819 --> 01:23:49.781]  They don't care if they're coming down, as long as they're still on top.
[01:23:50.061 --> 01:23:56.586]  I want everybody to be growing and beautiful and free and amazing and hopefully I'll be carried along with that tide.
[01:23:57.126 --> 01:23:57.807]  They don't like that.
[01:23:58.522 --> 01:23:59.663]  They want to dominate.
[01:23:59.964 --> 01:24:00.685]  They want to control.
[01:24:01.085 --> 01:24:02.947]  Well, I'm not funded by the British Royals.
[01:24:03.007 --> 01:24:04.649]  I'm not funded by George Soros and the New World Order.

[01:26:31.351 --> 01:26:31.912]  God bless you.
[01:26:32.232 --> 01:26:33.515]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:26:37.917 --> 01:26:44.384]  25 years ago, Princess Diana's car crashed inside the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris, France.
[01:26:45.004 --> 01:26:49.509]  Her lover, Dottie Fayed, died upon impact along with the driver.
[01:26:49.849 --> 01:26:55.735]  And even though Diana survived, it took about 40 minutes to get her from the car to the ambulance.
[01:26:56.115 --> 01:27:03.884]  The official story was that they were trying to free her from the car, but several witnesses say that Diana was conscious and unobstructed.
[01:27:04.404 --> 01:27:12.694]  Photographs show that the back seat of the car was undamaged, and witnesses were pleading with the police to open the door and help her.
[01:27:13.314 --> 01:27:17.335]  Once in the ambulance, it took about 40 minutes for them to choose a hospital.
[01:27:17.755 --> 01:27:27.378]  And when they finally set off, the ambulance drove at a snail's pace and made several stops, taking about 40 minutes to drive less than four miles.
[01:27:28.158 --> 01:27:29.459]  Doctors were turned away.
[01:27:29.819 --> 01:27:31.539]  Witnesses were strip-searched.
[01:27:31.859 --> 01:27:33.380]  Cameras were confiscated.
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.362]  No evidence was gathered.
[01:27:35.622 --> 01:27:37.525]  No blood samples were taken.
[01:27:37.905 --> 01:27:43.112]  And by 3 a.m., the entire scene was sprayed down with high-pressure water hoses.
[01:27:43.873 --> 01:27:49.239]  Mercedes wanted to study the wreckage to see why it failed so badly, but they were denied.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:52.243]  Diana's body was taken by the royal family.
[01:27:52.443 --> 01:27:56.287]  Who had her reproductive organs removed before burying her remains.
[01:27:57.068 --> 01:28:05.678]  All 17 cameras along the route of the crash were mysteriously turned off and all radio police frequencies went down.
[01:28:06.258 --> 01:28:09.922]  Witnesses were assaulted and threatened and there was no investigation.
[01:28:10.643 --> 01:28:21.613]  Not until the inquest ten years later, which is when most people learned that Diana had penned a note in 1996 saying that someone was going to kill her in a car accident.
[01:28:21.853 --> 01:28:24.075]  This note was concealed for six years.
[01:28:24.736 --> 01:28:30.121]  At the inquest, experts agreed that Diana would have survived if they had gotten her to a hospital.
[01:28:30.742 --> 01:28:33.864]  But the blame was put upon a military-style attack.
[01:28:34.545 --> 01:28:42.268]  According to witnesses, a group of motorcycles, along with a white Fiat Uno, worked in concert to crash the car.
[01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:48.351]  First, with a blinding flash of light, followed by an explosion from the front tire of the Mercedes.
[01:28:49.092 --> 01:29:00.977]  During the inquest, a former MI6 agent described being shown the very same plan in 1992 for a possible MI6 assassination of Slobodan Milosevic.
[01:29:01.437 --> 01:29:04.598]  And claimed it was MI6 who killed Diana.
[01:29:05.218 --> 01:29:13.759]  Because of all this, the inquest ended with the verdict of unlawful killing, blaming her death on the mysterious military hit squad.
[01:29:14.439 --> 01:29:23.561]  But the mainstream media spun the entire thing to make it sound like it was the paparazzi that caused her to crash, which is demonstrably false.
[01:29:23.941 --> 01:29:41.886]   And while there was no investigation into finding the members of this military hit squad, Three years later, the alleged driver of the white Fiat, who had ties to MI6, reportedly committed suicide after being found shot twice in the back of the head and burned inside of his car.
[01:29:42.686 --> 01:29:50.468]  During the inquest, many things were kept from the jury, such as the fact that Diana's seatbelt was found to be defective.
[01:29:51.008 --> 01:29:53.311]  And evidence of the car being sabotaged.
[01:29:53.771 --> 01:30:08.247]  Interestingly, these things would have brought more suspicion towards Dadi's father, Mohammed Al-Fayed, who, after turning down repeated offers from the French government to provide security, was solely responsible for Diana's security detail.
[01:30:08.787 --> 01:30:15.976]  And at the last minute, had them leave their security detail in front of the hotel as a decoy, and take a different car.
[01:30:16.397 --> 01:30:22.324]  A car that was recently stolen, broken, repaired, and never checked by security.
[01:30:23.105 --> 01:30:27.130]  Left with only one security guard, they were also assigned a new driver.
[01:30:27.731 --> 01:30:40.479]  Henri Paul, who had no chauffeur permit, was tied to foreign intelligence services, was seen on camera signaling to someone just before setting off, had received over 50,000 francs the day of the crash.
[01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:47.464]  And this was all under the watch of Mohammed Al-Fayed, who was deeply connected to the intelligence community.
[01:30:47.924 --> 01:30:57.660]   He was business partners with one of Lee Harvey Oswald's handlers, and represented the grandfather of Mohammed Atta, But none of that was mentioned during the inquest.
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:14.003]  Instead, with the help of pop culture agents such as Howard Stern and Piers Morgan, Mohammed Al-Fayed has provided the world with the cover story that Diana was pregnant with Dottie's child and Prince Philip had her killed because he's racist.
[01:31:14.823 --> 01:31:17.004]  Which seems like a strange cover story.
[01:31:17.484 --> 01:31:21.645]  That is, if you don't realize that the entire thing was a satanic ritual.
[01:31:22.697 --> 01:31:30.340]  Come back with our special guest in studio to the full video by Gregory's Ritual Sacrifice of the New World Order at Band.video.
[01:31:31.441 --> 01:31:39.064]  Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-serving monarch of the British Empire, the Saxe-Coburg Gotha, is dead.
[01:31:40.165 --> 01:31:52.089]   And the world is freaking out, but I'd be freaking out, because Prince Charles Who is an anti-human, New World Order depopulationist, like his father is now the King of England.
[01:31:52.529 --> 01:31:53.711]  That is a big deal.
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:57.421]  All right, we're going to have our special guest here with us this hour.
[01:31:57.441 --> 01:32:03.904]  We're going to take some calls on a whole bunch of topics from Aaron and Justin and Simon and Aaron and James and Greg and Joe and John.
[01:32:04.364 --> 01:32:06.005]  That's coming up at the bottom of the hour, so be patient.
[01:32:06.025 --> 01:32:06.585]  We're going to get to you.
[01:32:07.046 --> 01:32:08.686]  But I've been on a few shows with you.
[01:32:08.726 --> 01:32:10.187]  Senior comedy, it's really great stuff.
[01:32:10.607 --> 01:32:11.948]  Chrissy Mayer is here with us.
[01:32:12.088 --> 01:32:14.769]  Twitter ChrissyMayer, M-A-Y-R.
[01:32:15.409 --> 01:32:18.351]  She's performing tonight at the Cap City Comedy Club, which is a great place.
[01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:21.711]  up in North Austin.
[01:32:21.711 --> 01:32:24.949]  Christy Mayer live from January 6th and so much more.
[01:32:24.949 --> 01:32:30.510]   You're also one of the co-hosts on a lot of really popular shows
[01:32:30.510 --> 01:32:31.230]  that I've gone to.
[01:32:31.230 --> 01:32:34.150]  But of course, Friday Night Tights is a great program.
[01:32:34.150 --> 01:32:35.570]  In fact, we never air that enough.
[01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:40.430]   That last time I was on Friday Night Tights, they have that great Captain America intro.
[01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:41.041]  If that guy's fine, we'll play that later in the hour.
[01:32:41.541 --> 01:32:42.401]  Great to have you here.
[01:32:42.681 --> 01:32:44.082]  I know you could barely come on air.
[01:32:44.602 --> 01:32:45.222]  You're in the break.
[01:32:45.902 --> 01:32:46.723]  We had to get you out.
[01:32:46.803 --> 01:32:47.943]  You were pretty upset about the Queen.
[01:32:48.263 --> 01:32:48.943]  I was upset.
[01:32:49.043 --> 01:32:50.744]  I was sobbing in the bathroom.
[01:32:51.004 --> 01:32:53.025]  I didn't expect this.
[01:32:53.085 --> 01:32:55.986]  I thought she was going to live maybe another hundred or so years.
[01:32:56.006 --> 01:33:04.288]  I was like, why can't they just take her skin and pull it over another lizard and just throw her back out there and keep it going?
[01:33:04.328 --> 01:33:04.888]  But I don't know.
[01:33:05.589 --> 01:33:08.511]   Maybe she'll have a You know how girls have a birthday month?
[01:33:08.571 --> 01:33:11.473]  Maybe she'll have like a death month and they'll parade her around.
[01:33:11.654 --> 01:33:12.014]  I don't know.
[01:33:12.054 --> 01:33:12.775]  But she's dusty!
[01:33:12.815 --> 01:33:14.256]  And Prince Charles is dusty too!
[01:33:14.636 --> 01:33:15.477]  He's old too!
[01:33:15.797 --> 01:33:22.403]  He's gonna have like a week at the crown and then... Yeah, well there's no doubt that we're about to get a month of just weeping and wailing here.
[01:33:24.045 --> 01:33:24.926]  Yeah, it's a lot.
[01:33:25.306 --> 01:33:30.471]  But Princess Diana complained about Britain selling hundreds of millions of landmines, killing tens of thousands of children.
[01:33:30.791 --> 01:33:31.492]  She had to go bye-bye.
[01:33:32.759 --> 01:33:37.624]  Yeah, I've been watching all these videos that are coming up and it's like, damn, you guys really have the receipts.
[01:33:38.225 --> 01:33:39.186]  It's really crazy.
[01:33:39.506 --> 01:33:41.989]  She was so young and beautiful and everyone loved her.
[01:33:42.009 --> 01:33:47.135]  I didn't know she was pregnant with Dodie's kid, so it's exciting.
[01:33:47.175 --> 01:33:48.236]  But I'm so excited to be here.
[01:33:49.016 --> 01:33:51.238]  Alex, you're such a huge inspiration to me.
[01:33:51.838 --> 01:34:06.448]  I'm one of the first comics who, last summer, when de Blasio put down the vaccine mandate for the passports, and I was like, I'm not going to perform in any club that is forcing someone to get a vaccine or show proof of vaccine.
[01:34:06.688 --> 01:34:07.609]  And I was like, that's it.
[01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:09.330]  I perform in New York City, but I'm done.
[01:34:10.090 --> 01:34:33.079]  I took a stand and honestly like you were one of the people who inspired me to do that and I got a lot of flack for it and then a few other comics came out and similarly like Jim Brewer wasn't gonna perform anywhere that mandated the vaccine and I'm just so stoked to be here and I wanted to give you this shirt Alex because it's my Make America Great Again shirt.
[01:34:33.099 --> 01:34:34.020]  I love it, that's awesome.
[01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:35.903]  And I'm so excited.
[01:34:35.963 --> 01:34:37.106]  I bought two of your books.
[01:34:37.326 --> 01:34:39.332]  I haven't read them yet, but they look great.
[01:34:39.552 --> 01:34:41.497]  There's no pictures, but I'm so excited to read them.
[01:34:41.517 --> 01:34:42.580]  Well, you shouldn't have bought the book.
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:43.302]  I would have given you one.
[01:34:45.111 --> 01:34:46.512]  I'm so excited to be here.
[01:34:46.592 --> 01:34:47.693]  I'm going to read these books.
[01:34:48.514 --> 01:34:49.435]  Well, I'm going to read one of them.
[01:34:50.155 --> 01:34:51.256]  I'll probably have you sign them.
[01:34:51.276 --> 01:34:52.618]  You're going to read each one each time.
[01:34:53.659 --> 01:34:54.299]  I'll give you 10 books.
[01:34:54.319 --> 01:34:55.500]  You've got to read them 10 times.
[01:34:55.941 --> 01:35:06.750]  No, but seriously, going back to the lockdowns, which they now admit were total fraud, the vaccine doesn't work, 9 out of 10 dying, Landsat Medical Journal, in Europe, in the UK, in the US, have been triple jabbed.
[01:35:06.810 --> 01:35:08.852]  I mean, this thing has blown up in their face.
[01:35:09.451 --> 01:35:14.614]  People are dying, babies, like all these studies are coming out and they're just doubling down.
[01:35:14.654 --> 01:35:20.537]  Like even in my hotel yesterday, I watched a commercial that was, you know, they're basically using propaganda.
[01:35:20.617 --> 01:35:22.278]  It's like a dad with his daughter.
[01:35:22.478 --> 01:35:24.499]  Oh, don't miss out on the special moments.
[01:35:24.559 --> 01:35:26.240]  Get your booster at Walgreens.
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:27.321]  I'm like, wow, it's like.
[01:35:28.081 --> 01:35:31.202]  It's as if none of these studies have come out at all.
[01:35:32.023 --> 01:35:38.865]  And the babies, like there's a study about babies are, you know, like a good percentage of them are acting differently after they're shot.
[01:35:38.945 --> 01:35:40.126]  And I'm just like, how?
[01:35:40.266 --> 01:35:40.606]  I don't know.
[01:35:40.906 --> 01:35:42.026]  How do people not see this?
[01:35:42.106 --> 01:35:42.487]  I don't know.
[01:35:42.687 --> 01:35:50.249]  Well, that's the thing is they count on us not having a memory, but people have a memory of what they've done.
[01:35:50.269 --> 01:35:51.310]  So I don't see how they get away with this.
[01:35:52.546 --> 01:36:06.784]  It's gonna be, it's gonna be pretty gross when we have a generation of kids who are not able to have their own kids or they're just, and I could see like a group of kids having like basically a support group because their mom was going through something and now they're mutilated or...
[01:36:07.825 --> 01:36:08.245]  I don't know.
[01:36:08.445 --> 01:36:10.046]  I think we had it hard growing up.
[01:36:10.106 --> 01:36:12.707]  I was like, oh man, I got hit a couple times.
[01:36:12.747 --> 01:36:13.888]  My dad threw a chair at me.
[01:36:13.948 --> 01:36:19.330]  But I think these kids now have the hardest because they'll grow up and be like, oh yeah, my mom was going through something.
[01:36:19.711 --> 01:36:20.731]  She lived in Brooklyn.
[01:36:20.771 --> 01:36:21.672]  She had five cats.
[01:36:21.712 --> 01:36:23.492]  She convinced me to get my boobs removed.
[01:36:24.213 --> 01:36:24.573]  I don't know.
[01:36:24.813 --> 01:36:26.234]  And she gave me an experimental shot.
[01:36:26.414 --> 01:36:26.614]  Yeah.
[01:36:27.862 --> 01:36:28.443]  Absolutely.
[01:36:28.503 --> 01:36:30.064]  So what's front and center for you?
[01:36:30.084 --> 01:36:35.789]  I've got a lot of talking points here and some of the things you want to go over, but what are some of the big stories you want to hit?
[01:36:36.450 --> 01:36:37.711]  I'm very concerned.
[01:36:38.131 --> 01:36:54.427]   I know Libs of TikTok has done some work on exposing some of these hospitals, especially in Chicago, that have been caught basically doing these Gender reassignment surgeries, these gender-affirming hysterectomies, and they're just being caught red-handed.
[01:36:54.727 --> 01:37:02.876]  And I believe one of the hospitals, I think it was the Lurie Hospital in Chicago, they are basically promoting grooming.
[01:37:02.916 --> 01:37:12.751]   They're doing this series of videos like, yeah, I think they're called gender Like the gender pronoun, I forget what they're calling it.
[01:37:12.771 --> 01:37:18.393]  Don't be scared, you're a big kid, we're going to cut your breast off, or cut your genitals off, it's just insane.
[01:37:19.074 --> 01:37:25.856]  And I saw a report out of Europe where they're going to let children decide, and one out of Canada, I didn't see it in the stat guys, print it for me again.
[01:37:26.417 --> 01:37:30.658]  Canada hospitals are starting to tell 5 year olds they can commit suicide.
[01:37:30.998 --> 01:37:34.440]  And if the 5 year old says they want it, the parents don't have an answer, they kill the kid.
[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:37.101]  That's literally the state convincing a child to be killed.
[01:37:38.109 --> 01:37:45.116]  I saw an article that they're literally providing this to be an option for adults.
[01:37:46.136 --> 01:37:51.742]  If they're going to go broke during the next couple years or during the energy crisis, they can't afford to keep their homes heated.
[01:37:51.762 --> 01:37:57.006]  I actually saw this article that they're offering assisted suicides basically for adults as well.
[01:37:57.107 --> 01:37:59.389]  So it's pretty blatant.
[01:37:59.469 --> 01:38:01.711]  In fact, guys, print me that because I saw it on InfoWars last night.
[01:38:01.731 --> 01:38:02.311]  It was on the CBC.
[01:38:03.352 --> 01:38:05.375]  And they were reporting it, like, I forgot to tell the crew to get it for me.
[01:38:05.455 --> 01:38:09.800]  They were calling and reporting, yeah, we're going to teach children to commit suicide and if they want to die, they die.
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:11.682]  Well, a child can't make decisions.
[01:38:12.042 --> 01:38:12.203]  Yeah.
[01:38:12.383 --> 01:38:13.784]  So think about how evil that is.
[01:38:13.824 --> 01:38:17.008]  They don't want to just mutilate, cut their breasts off or their genitals off.
[01:38:17.328 --> 01:38:18.149]  Now they want to kill them.
[01:38:18.209 --> 01:38:19.231]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:38:19.810 --> 01:38:25.154]  Yeah, it's beyond... I mean, I guess they're probably going to reframe it and call it very late-term abortion.
[01:38:25.914 --> 01:38:27.135]  It's just, it's disgusting.
[01:38:27.195 --> 01:38:27.955]  It's inhumane.
[01:38:28.856 --> 01:38:32.478]  There was a story that we were talking about yesterday on the war room of this couple.
[01:38:32.539 --> 01:38:34.940]  I think they were out of either Canada or Australia.
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:38.322]  They're like, we don't even want to know the gender of our baby when it's born.
[01:38:38.382 --> 01:38:41.304]  We want to raise it as non-binary.
[01:38:41.324 --> 01:38:45.927]  And it's like, yeah, but you are in your attempt to want to not force your kid into gender roles.
[01:38:45.967 --> 01:38:46.668]  Oh, they're doing it.
[01:38:46.688 --> 01:38:47.649]  They're teaching them this.
[01:38:48.069 --> 01:38:49.530]  And a child's going to comply with his parents.
[01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:53.951]  Yeah, they just, a child has survival mechanisms within them.
[01:38:54.292 --> 01:39:00.134]  They are going to do, they're going to listen to their parents, they're going to listen to the teachers, whatever adults are around them, they're going to listen just to get by.
[01:39:00.154 --> 01:39:05.716]  And I'm not trying to be mean, but if you look at the people that have been caught in this, they are like mutants.
[01:39:05.876 --> 01:39:06.616]  They're pretty gross.
[01:39:06.756 --> 01:39:08.637]  But at the same time, let's not sterilize them.
[01:39:09.077 --> 01:39:09.677]  I mean, come on.
[01:39:10.613 --> 01:39:15.056]  There are so many forms of birth control available, like for these people, like their personality.
[01:39:15.076 --> 01:39:21.580]  It's like, you're a mutant, and we understand the government targeted you with a program to kill you, but we still have to warn them.
[01:39:22.159 --> 01:39:22.379]  Yeah.
[01:39:22.719 --> 01:39:26.301]  Plus their children aren't, and they're being opted into it by these mutant parents.
[01:39:26.781 --> 01:39:27.522]  It's so sad.
[01:39:27.602 --> 01:39:28.822]  It's so disgusting.
[01:39:29.002 --> 01:39:31.083]  They're really maiming these kids for life.
[01:39:31.444 --> 01:39:37.887]  And I don't know, I just hope God helps them out, helps them show them the way, because it's very abusive.
[01:39:38.147 --> 01:39:42.669]  Well, you grow up hearing about Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia or whatever, and you think, man, that could never happen here.
[01:39:42.689 --> 01:39:43.669]  It is happening.
[01:39:43.689 --> 01:39:44.510]  It's just a new attack.
[01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:45.170]  It is.
[01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:46.831]  Yeah, they're just using different tools.
[01:39:48.072 --> 01:40:00.260]  And it's just like you, you know, politicians, our government, they use the same tactics that Hollywood uses with, you know, they don't try to, they just bury the news they don't want you to see with more and more fluffy, like BS news.
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:02.001]  Like, oh, here's what the housewives are up to.
[01:40:02.381 --> 01:40:03.882]  Here's what Chrissy Teigen's doing.
[01:40:03.962 --> 01:40:09.506]  And it's like, it's just, they just try to bury you with unnecessary distraction news so you don't find.
[01:40:10.407 --> 01:40:11.848]  The news that you actually really need to know.
[01:40:11.908 --> 01:40:15.472]  And then if you break through like Andrew Tate or myself or others, then they come after you.
[01:40:15.792 --> 01:40:16.453]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:16.653 --> 01:40:18.895]  Being cancelled is definitely a sign you're doing something right.
[01:40:18.935 --> 01:40:23.319]  But Joe Rogan knew how to run the rail, as I told folks, Joe's as awake as I am.
[01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:24.701]  But he definitely played him.
[01:40:25.288 --> 01:40:29.271]  I mean, he definitely knew how to, like, stay in position to end up kicking their ass.
[01:40:29.491 --> 01:40:30.892]  He has to be very careful.
[01:40:30.932 --> 01:40:36.776]  Yeah, it's hard to tell where he actually... what he believes, but he's like, no, I don't think they did it on purpose.
[01:40:36.816 --> 01:40:38.538]  I don't think they released the virus on purpose.
[01:40:38.578 --> 01:40:39.899]  I think they were overwhelmed.
[01:40:39.919 --> 01:40:42.120]  And then, you know... But it doesn't work, and it's horrible.
[01:40:43.281 --> 01:40:43.481]  Yeah.
[01:40:45.503 --> 01:40:45.643]  Ugh.
[01:40:46.203 --> 01:40:46.864]  Joe's great, though.
[01:40:46.904 --> 01:40:51.527]  Yeah, he's like, oh, I just think they handled it wrong, and they were overwhelmed, and these are unprecedented times.
[01:40:51.587 --> 01:40:52.628]  I'm like, ugh, I don't know.
[01:40:52.668 --> 01:40:54.209]  But at the key point, he came out against it.
[01:40:54.941 --> 01:40:56.683]  So that's what I'm saying.
[01:40:57.003 --> 01:40:58.124]  He can do his judo.
[01:40:58.144 --> 01:41:01.328]  I'm going to do my frontal assault down their throat.
[01:41:01.868 --> 01:41:03.190]  Chrissy Mayer, stay right there.
[01:41:03.029 --> 01:41:05.029]  Mayor on Twitter.
[01:41:05.029 --> 01:41:07.029]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:41:07.029 --> 01:41:17.029]  [SOUND]
[01:41:17.029 --> 01:41:23.029]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:41:23.029 --> 01:41:24.029]  Comfortable?
[01:41:24.029 --> 01:41:28.029]  It wasn't until this Friday night that I hit a wall.
[01:41:27.746 --> 01:41:30.786]   I was supposed to be finishing my nightly newsletter that I mentioned.
[01:41:30.786 --> 01:41:32.786]  [Screaming]
[01:41:32.786 --> 01:41:36.786]  Oh yes, yes, yes.
[01:41:36.786 --> 01:41:38.786]  [Squeaking]
[01:41:38.786 --> 01:41:52.784]  [Music]
[01:41:52.784 --> 01:41:54.784]  [Applause]
[01:41:54.784 --> 01:41:56.784]  Do you like your new body?
[01:41:56.347 --> 01:41:58.347]  I love it.
[01:41:58.347 --> 01:42:07.347]  [Music]
[01:42:07.347 --> 01:42:09.347]  Your operation's blown!
[01:42:09.347 --> 01:42:10.347]  75 years.
[01:42:10.539 --> 01:42:17.985]  75 years later... Christy Mayer, comedian, is our guest in studio.
[01:42:18.025 --> 01:42:19.026]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:42:20.572 --> 01:42:21.572]  Got a lot of stories to hit.
[01:42:21.592 --> 01:42:23.233]  A lot of topics you want to hit.
[01:42:23.253 --> 01:42:24.274]  But what about this one poll?
[01:42:24.334 --> 01:42:27.295]  Almost a quarter of Democrats believe men can get pregnant.
[01:42:27.335 --> 01:42:29.056]  These are the people that want to be our fact checkers.
[01:42:29.636 --> 01:42:31.257]  These are the people that want to be in control of reality.
[01:42:31.277 --> 01:42:32.557]  What do you think of that?
[01:42:32.618 --> 01:42:32.978]  I don't know.
[01:42:33.058 --> 01:42:39.641]  I think if men had to give birth through a certain part of their body, they would think twice about having these particular beliefs.
[01:42:40.081 --> 01:42:41.121]  It's really unbelievable.
[01:42:41.141 --> 01:42:48.705]  Well, I see the whole transgender thing as just to confuse us and get us to accept anything and really attack the biology of humans and really attack women.
[01:42:49.235 --> 01:42:56.760]  Oh, for sure, and especially as they're moving forward on creating, like, I guess a race of humans that don't need men or women to be conceived.
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:58.781]  They want to blur the lines of humanity.
[01:42:59.121 --> 01:43:01.423]  They want to make us all okay with pedophilia.
[01:43:01.503 --> 01:43:07.747]  They want kids to be exposed to queer education and be introduced into the kink community.
[01:43:07.767 --> 01:43:14.671]  They're just trying to blur every little line they can, and it's all just so disgusting, and they're just basically trying to rip apart humanity.
[01:43:16.775 --> 01:43:20.339]  I can ask a thousand questions and I will, but what else is on your mind?
[01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:23.843]  Oh gosh, I mean, I think this is pretty funny.
[01:43:23.883 --> 01:43:32.493]  There is a, uh, there's a diner in Virginia that, or it's a country club, that is getting flack because it had a 9-11 themed menu.
[01:43:35.803 --> 01:43:50.348]  And they had, they offered, this is called, tone-deaf items such as chocolate silk pentagon pie, 2977 chowder, first responder flatbread, and they got into a lot of, they got a lot of flack basically for it.
[01:43:50.448 --> 01:43:52.509]  But I don't know, I think these guys should lean in.
[01:43:53.329 --> 01:43:56.290]  I think they should be like, yeah, it's controlled demolitious.
[01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:58.911]  It's, you know, never, they should have like, never.
[01:43:58.931 --> 01:44:00.832]  Yeah, the Building 7 Seafood Tower.
[01:44:02.113 --> 01:44:05.896]  Yeah, they should have like... We're not making fun of who died on that line, we're making fun of the fact that Deep State was involved.
[01:44:06.136 --> 01:44:08.878]  Yeah, we should have like an inside job kebab.
[01:44:09.339 --> 01:44:11.340]  I just think that they shouldn't apologize.
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:17.805]  And it's okay to be funny, it's okay to laugh, it's okay to make fun of things and tragedies.
[01:44:17.845 --> 01:44:25.432]  Like if we were all, and I get flack for this all the time, if we're just gonna make fun and make comedy out of the happy times in our life, that's gonna be pretty boring, so.
[01:44:26.152 --> 01:44:27.772]  I hate that these guys are apologizing.
[01:44:27.832 --> 01:44:28.793]  They should just lean into it.
[01:44:28.813 --> 01:44:31.633]  What do you think is going to happen in the midterm, 61 days out?
[01:44:32.913 --> 01:44:34.214]  I think the Republicans are going to take it.
[01:44:34.274 --> 01:44:37.314]  I know the Democrats are pretty, they're pretty much freaking out right now.
[01:44:37.654 --> 01:44:44.716]  And I think they're just trying to like buckle down and hold on to whatever they can in case they just completely lose.
[01:44:44.976 --> 01:44:47.496]  And, you know, I think they're just so scared.
[01:44:47.516 --> 01:44:50.377]  But it's going to be interesting to see what happens.
[01:44:50.437 --> 01:45:05.672]   Like, I know Lee, his last name is escaping me, but his numbers against Kathy Hochul in New York are higher than I thought they would be at this point, so that's encouraging, especially as a New Yorker.
[01:45:05.692 --> 01:45:08.195]  Well, they're running all these polls saying Republicans are going to lose.
[01:45:08.676 --> 01:45:11.239]  That way people accept election fraud, which they're going to try again.
[01:45:11.567 --> 01:45:12.748]  Yeah, yeah, it makes sense.
[01:45:13.448 --> 01:45:15.669]  Makes sense that they're just going to try to pull that over.
[01:45:15.729 --> 01:45:18.351]  And I know Tina Forte is running against AOC.
[01:45:18.391 --> 01:45:19.371]  Yeah, Lee Zeldin.
[01:45:19.591 --> 01:45:19.832]  Yeah.
[01:45:20.452 --> 01:45:25.595]  He was the guy who was attacked with a knife, like I think during one of his rallies.
[01:45:25.615 --> 01:45:27.296]  I lived hard.
[01:45:27.316 --> 01:45:31.018]  I mean, it'd be great to see him beat her.
[01:45:31.258 --> 01:45:37.061]  But again, like they could be just setting this up for more election fraud anywhere they can.
[01:45:37.101 --> 01:45:38.902]  What are you seeing the pulse of the country being?
[01:45:38.942 --> 01:45:40.363]  I'm seeing a total awakening.
[01:45:40.888 --> 01:45:55.991]  Me too, and sometimes you get a little bit annoyed with saying the same things over and over again, but I'm finding the average people, I think the baseline level of awareness is starting to rise much higher than it was even at this time last year.
[01:45:56.111 --> 01:46:05.973]  People are over getting boosters, people are done with the institutions, people have fully lost faith in the medical industry and big pharma.
[01:46:07.573 --> 01:46:08.975]  Everything, really.
[01:46:09.135 --> 01:46:12.059]  And I remember that's when I first heard about you, a year and a half ago, whatever.
[01:46:12.379 --> 01:46:18.826]  You were against the lockdowns, you were against wearing masks, making people take shots to go to your shows, and a lot of the people followed you after that.
[01:46:18.847 --> 01:46:19.828]  That's what leadership's about.
[01:46:20.844 --> 01:46:21.185]  Thank you.
[01:46:21.225 --> 01:46:25.027]  Yeah, sometimes you wonder, you know, you're just sometimes like, oh, I'm just sending out tweets.
[01:46:25.047 --> 01:46:26.388]  I'm just sending out dick jokes.
[01:46:26.448 --> 01:46:28.249]  Like who is even seeing any of this?
[01:46:28.369 --> 01:46:33.352]  But it it does make a difference just a little bit, just one person at a time.
[01:46:33.392 --> 01:46:37.395]  If you can wake them up and make them think for themselves, it's it makes a huge difference.
[01:46:37.435 --> 01:46:47.901]  And I had some gigs that were scheduled in California that I canceled because I was like, I'm not going to perform anywhere that forces people to take the vaccine or wear masks or any of this any of this B.S.
[01:46:48.021 --> 01:46:48.202]  So.
[01:46:49.703 --> 01:47:09.259]  I feel good to like to have been one of the first people who kind of stood up against it because I think it emboldened a lot of people to do the same and it's always hardest to be you know the first person to do anything but I think we're all starting to come together as a group and you know yeah it feels like there's more of a baseline bravery among just like your average American.
[01:47:10.143 --> 01:47:11.263]  I don't think it's fair to say.
[01:47:11.323 --> 01:47:19.405]  I think it's an established fact, and they admit this, that there's a total collapse in corporate media, viewership, trust, support, an explosion in alternative media.
[01:47:19.926 --> 01:47:24.207]  All the attempts at censorship the last four years, again, have only created a strident effect.
[01:47:24.847 --> 01:47:28.688]  Why do they think that they could override history and override the trend?
[01:47:29.375 --> 01:47:30.236]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:30.456 --> 01:47:34.618]  I didn't even know who Andrew Tate was until he got completely cancelled.
[01:47:34.658 --> 01:47:39.521]  And now I'm just like trying to find more and more videos of the guy and learn all I can about him.
[01:47:39.601 --> 01:47:45.385]  So I think anytime somebody is cancelled off any of these major platforms, it just piques more curiosity.
[01:47:45.405 --> 01:47:48.206]  I taped an hour-long interview with him this morning.
[01:47:48.226 --> 01:47:49.627]  We're going to air it on Monday.
[01:47:49.887 --> 01:47:51.068]  And he's never been stronger.
[01:47:51.488 --> 01:47:51.649]  Wow.
[01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:53.149]  And he's not buckling to the attack.
[01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.810]  That's what's beautiful.
[01:47:54.335 --> 01:48:03.122]  Yeah, because he, just like Kevin Samuels, are offering up something, a kind of advice that men and women haven't been getting ever.
[01:48:03.262 --> 01:48:07.065]  And I think, you know, most, they want people to be sheep and listen to the mainstream.
[01:48:07.105 --> 01:48:12.069]  They want women to stay feminist and, you know, do all the things that don't make them attractive.
[01:48:12.809 --> 01:48:13.750]  And same thing with men.
[01:48:13.770 --> 01:48:18.834]  They want men to be weak and basically they want all of humanity to not reach their full potential.
[01:48:18.854 --> 01:48:22.317]  They don't want people... And you know, we hear feminist, that's anti-feminine.
[01:48:23.951 --> 01:48:24.912]  Oh yeah, right.
[01:48:25.132 --> 01:48:29.515]  They're not supporting women to be strong in the ways that women are typically strong.
[01:48:29.555 --> 01:48:37.159]  Like they're not encouraging women to be nurturing or empathetic or compassionate or, you know, make sandwiches.
[01:48:37.199 --> 01:48:39.301]  You know, the areas that we really excel in.
[01:48:39.681 --> 01:48:41.042]  They just, they want women to be like that.
[01:48:41.062 --> 01:48:42.162]  Women do a lot of amazing things.
[01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:48.006]  The point is we're a biological team and all these globalists are trying to use women as their front person.
[01:48:48.832 --> 01:48:52.255]  Yeah, I mean, I think women are a little easier to sigh up.
[01:48:52.335 --> 01:48:54.918]  I think that's why it helps to have friends.
[01:48:55.398 --> 01:48:58.140]  That's what's great about being a comic, is like I'm friends with a lot of guys.
[01:48:58.481 --> 01:49:01.263]  And yeah, we definitely need each other.
[01:49:01.343 --> 01:49:06.028]  And I think, and I know from experience, I was a women's studies minor in college.
[01:49:06.068 --> 01:49:07.529]  I was a full-blown feminist.
[01:49:07.629 --> 01:49:08.430]  I graduated.
[01:49:08.490 --> 01:49:10.151]  I was the whole like, I'm never gonna get married.
[01:49:10.211 --> 01:49:11.052]  I'm never gonna have kids.
[01:49:11.092 --> 01:49:12.033]  I had short hair.
[01:49:12.113 --> 01:49:15.724]   Like, I was the whole, I was the whole They were stealing your power.
[01:49:15.844 --> 01:49:19.866]  They really were, and I was unhappy all the time, and I couldn't figure out why.
[01:49:19.886 --> 01:49:20.666]  Well, now you're happy.
[01:49:20.687 --> 01:49:23.548]  Let's talk about feminism versus real femininity straight ahead.
[01:49:24.068 --> 01:49:28.410]  Well, well-known and successful comedian Chrissy Mayer is our guest in studio.
[01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:30.691]  We're going to go to your phone calls here in a moment.
[01:49:30.711 --> 01:49:31.771]  Everybody's been holding patiently.
[01:49:31.791 --> 01:49:32.431]  We're going to get to you.
[01:49:32.912 --> 01:49:43.565]   And then Paul Joseph Watson, who is in deep mourning in the United Kingdom, but he will be able to host, barely, He told me, he said, like, he's going to try.
[01:49:44.085 --> 01:49:48.346]  Ten days of mornings coming, the Queen of England dead, Paul Watson hosting the next hour.
[01:49:48.966 --> 01:49:58.510]  So, Christy Mayer, we're talking about fake feminism versus femininity and the real power of women, and now they have all these men trying to say they're women stealing that power.
[01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:59.410]  Your take on that?
[01:49:59.750 --> 01:50:11.340]  Yeah, for me, I mean, I was very much a brainwashed feminist in college after graduation, and then part of my awakening was realizing, like, wow, I can't get this air conditioner in this window by myself.
[01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:14.903]  It's so easy to be a feminist until you need something lifted.
[01:50:14.963 --> 01:50:15.904]  And then I was like, you know what?
[01:50:16.725 --> 01:50:18.526]  Men are not so bad after all.
[01:50:18.747 --> 01:50:20.788]  Who's going to help me put this furniture together?
[01:50:20.808 --> 01:50:22.290]  And that's just what...
[01:50:22.930 --> 01:50:45.218]   The government wants to do they want you to be reliant on them and not another man and honestly I give so much props and thanks to my fiance Frank Pellegrino because like honestly when he met me I was just coming out of my like disgusting feminist phase and he helps guide me and support me and he helped me start a business and I was about to say, I mean, it's not bad for a man to say a woman's pretty.
[01:50:45.238 --> 01:50:47.218]  I mean, I'm glad you grew your hair out.
[01:50:47.238 --> 01:50:47.838]  It's very lovely.
[01:50:47.958 --> 01:50:48.418]  Thank you.
[01:50:48.478 --> 01:50:50.219]  It's like a beautiful flower or something.
[01:50:50.579 --> 01:50:51.939]  And it's okay for men to admire that.
[01:50:51.959 --> 01:50:56.140]  I mean, they want to isolate us from each other, but it's men and women together that create that dynamism.
[01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:56.760]  Yeah.
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:57.761]  Oh, for sure.
[01:50:58.041 --> 01:51:01.261]  This is why I don't understand when women get upset about being catcalled.
[01:51:01.301 --> 01:51:04.102]  It's like, girl, like, enjoy these moments, okay?
[01:51:04.122 --> 01:51:05.822]  They're not going to last forever, okay?
[01:51:05.842 --> 01:51:08.323]  Like, when you get dusty, you're not going to get catcalled.
[01:51:09.141 --> 01:51:10.163]  Well, let's talk about that.
[01:51:10.703 --> 01:51:16.512]  I mean, look, Desmond Morris, the great animal behaviorist, pointed out that you can call dogs parasites.
[01:51:16.532 --> 01:51:20.818]  I mean, they're these hunter wolves that finally came to the campfire and got some food and then got domesticated.
[01:51:20.838 --> 01:51:22.360]  But we take care of them.
[01:51:23.183 --> 01:51:27.025]  And I'm not saying men take care of women, but men go out and fight wars, they do the dirty jobs.
[01:51:27.545 --> 01:51:31.027]  And really, if you study human civilization, the women are really running the show.
[01:51:31.607 --> 01:51:38.231]  And so women are being taken out of that prime position by the state that wants to have the relationship with the woman, then have the woman direct the man.
[01:51:38.531 --> 01:51:41.893]  Hitler said, first you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:43.601]  Yeah, that makes so much sense.
[01:51:43.662 --> 01:51:55.817]  They want women and men to hate each other, to detach, and actually having a good man in your life makes you a much stronger and more feminine woman, and they don't want us realizing that.
[01:51:55.878 --> 01:51:56.839]  They want us to be separated.
[01:51:56.859 --> 01:51:58.261]  That's the thing, the feminists are anti-feminine.
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:08.247]  Yeah, they only accept a certain type of being female, which is to be angry and to hate men and to be an island and not need anyone.
[01:52:08.307 --> 01:52:10.628]  And they're so unhappy and they don't know why.
[01:52:10.648 --> 01:52:11.409]  Well, they're pimps.
[01:52:11.629 --> 01:52:13.130]  I mean, Gloria Steinem was CIA.
[01:52:13.470 --> 01:52:15.051]  They want to run the power that's women.
[01:52:15.411 --> 01:52:16.852]  Yeah, they want to act like men.
[01:52:16.933 --> 01:52:20.295]  Instead of women interfacing with men running each other.
[01:52:20.675 --> 01:52:21.495]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:52:21.515 --> 01:52:23.275]  Because you get a man and a woman together, it's like boom!
[01:52:23.656 --> 01:52:31.877]  We need each other and like my fiancé makes me a better person, like I hope I make him a better person, but he is like, he is like the brains.
[01:52:32.037 --> 01:52:34.157]  He helps me so much with my podcast.
[01:52:34.437 --> 01:52:35.638]  He really is so supportive.
[01:52:35.678 --> 01:52:38.598]  There's no way I would be here if it weren't for him.
[01:52:38.618 --> 01:52:48.820]  There's no way I would, I mean, I lost my, I had a day job up until December and they fired me because I wouldn't take the vaccine and they wanted us to all go back and work in the building in New York City.
[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:51.941]  Now you're going to be more powerful full time.
[01:52:52.341 --> 01:52:53.122]  Oh yeah.
[01:52:53.302 --> 01:52:54.022]  Full blast.
[01:52:54.082 --> 01:52:54.602]  I'm doing this.
[01:52:54.722 --> 01:52:55.623]  I celebrated.
[01:52:55.663 --> 01:52:57.104]  I bought more push-up bras.
[01:52:57.664 --> 01:53:01.006]  So I'm ready to just go full blast comedian podcaster.
[01:53:02.967 --> 01:53:05.528]  The power structure is losing their war against humanity in my view.
[01:53:06.121 --> 01:53:06.861]  I think so, too.
[01:53:07.021 --> 01:53:07.622]  I think so, too.
[01:53:07.682 --> 01:53:11.723]  I think, like, women are realizing that they are more powerful when they find the right man.
[01:53:11.743 --> 01:53:15.204]  Because the right man will uplift you and help you achieve your dreams.
[01:53:15.264 --> 01:53:17.025]  And it's like, the government's not going to do that.
[01:53:17.305 --> 01:53:21.007]  They want you working nine to five for them until the day you die.
[01:53:21.027 --> 01:53:22.807]  I mean, a man and woman together is a team.
[01:53:23.107 --> 01:53:23.928]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:53:23.948 --> 01:53:27.249]  A team that can, like, literally a man and a woman together create a whole new civilization.
[01:53:27.349 --> 01:53:31.150]  I mean, women make babies and can feed them and the men go out and get the food.
[01:53:31.190 --> 01:53:32.271]  I mean, it's like a team.
[01:53:32.551 --> 01:53:32.731]  Yeah.
[01:53:32.751 --> 01:53:34.872]  I mean, it's like a terraforming operation.
[01:53:36.192 --> 01:53:37.875]  Are you trying to get me to reproduce with you, Alex?
[01:53:37.935 --> 01:53:39.037]  Is that what this is leading to?
[01:53:39.598 --> 01:53:41.821]  I've already reproduced a few times.
[01:53:42.663 --> 01:53:45.467]  No, I mean, seriously, I'm just saying, it's powerful.
[01:53:46.129 --> 01:53:48.731]  It really is, and they don't want you to know how powerful it is.
[01:53:48.751 --> 01:53:51.912]  You guys, we were meant to be together.
[01:53:51.972 --> 01:54:02.979]  I mean, I feel like I'm preaching to the choir here, but in so many cases, the powers that be don't want us to know how powerful we are and what we can achieve when we work together.
[01:54:02.999 --> 01:54:05.140]  Well, that's the whole point of the species.
[01:54:05.881 --> 01:54:09.923]  When that happens, that's what they go, oh, we want to end biology in men and women.
[01:54:10.143 --> 01:54:11.484]  How we operate is that biology.
[01:54:11.944 --> 01:54:12.705]  That's what we do.
[01:54:13.025 --> 01:54:15.387]  Then we have children and we love the future because we love them.
[01:54:15.407 --> 01:54:16.588]  Then we build a better world.
[01:54:16.968 --> 01:54:17.729]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:54:17.769 --> 01:54:24.675]  And it's funny, I got engaged maybe a couple months ago and people are in my comments like, oh my god, you're glowing, you look so happy.
[01:54:24.715 --> 01:54:26.696]  And it's like, yeah, I feel loved.
[01:54:26.876 --> 01:54:27.857]  This is great.
[01:54:28.117 --> 01:54:33.622]  This tops all the years of random, casual hand jobs.
[01:54:33.682 --> 01:54:37.125]  Well, wait till you have children.
[01:54:37.405 --> 01:54:38.446]  A switch is going to get flipped.
[01:54:40.017 --> 01:54:41.357]  You're not talking about hand jobs anymore?
[01:54:41.557 --> 01:54:42.538]  No, I'm not.
[01:54:42.618 --> 01:54:46.599]  Once you have a child, it's like next level.
[01:54:47.079 --> 01:54:48.920]  I'm hoping it'll all snap back.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.701]  I'm hoping it'll just be toit again.
[01:54:52.461 --> 01:54:54.982]  Well, we're all gonna die, but we live through our children forever.
[01:54:55.442 --> 01:54:55.742]  That's true.
[01:54:55.762 --> 01:54:57.963]  And I'm telling you, men and women together is a ritual.
[01:54:58.423 --> 01:55:01.664]  Having a child, like when the sperm meets the egg, there's an explosion of electricity.
[01:55:02.124 --> 01:55:03.124]  This is big time.
[01:55:03.424 --> 01:55:03.644]  Wow.
[01:55:03.984 --> 01:55:04.305]  This is it.
[01:55:05.865 --> 01:55:06.506]  That's exciting.
[01:55:06.526 --> 01:55:07.227]  Oh, it is exciting.
[01:55:07.247 --> 01:55:08.508]  They don't teach you that in school.
[01:55:08.528 --> 01:55:13.494]  They're like, oh, you got to get an abortion because, you know, we don't want anything to interrupt brunch.
[01:55:13.574 --> 01:55:15.656]  You have to be the mimosa queen until you're 60.
[01:55:15.696 --> 01:55:16.777]  Well, that's right.
[01:55:16.798 --> 01:55:18.019]  That gets in the way of your fun.
[01:55:18.319 --> 01:55:21.423]  And then all these liberal women are 45, 50 with no man.
[01:55:22.003 --> 01:55:25.828]  Or they got some man that literally, you know, does nothing and they're totally unhappy.
[01:55:26.228 --> 01:55:26.649]  It's crazy.
[01:55:26.949 --> 01:55:41.720]  Yeah, I noticed a lot of women that were, like, kind of stayed on the feminist track that I went to college with, like, the men that they're with now are weak, and everyone looks sad, and I just don't think... What's the sad part of it is, of course, not everyone is meant to, like, be married.
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:52.809]  Some people are very happy being alone, but for the women who do want that, they are brainwashed for just enough years that it's, like, almost sometimes too late for them when they wake up, and they're like, oh, shoot them.
[01:55:53.576 --> 01:55:53.876]  I'm like 40.
[01:55:54.037 --> 01:55:56.279]  Or they become wedded to the system and get more extreme.
[01:55:56.599 --> 01:55:56.819]  Yeah.
[01:55:57.359 --> 01:55:58.040]  I mean, look at these women.
[01:55:59.301 --> 01:55:59.401]  Ugh.
[01:55:59.962 --> 01:56:05.647]  I mean, I'm enjoying the one that looks like a middle school desk in like the middle there.
[01:56:06.267 --> 01:56:07.969]  But this is, yeah, this is not a good sight.
[01:56:08.590 --> 01:56:11.752]  I think blue hair is considered a form of... Well, look what they've done to themselves.
[01:56:11.792 --> 01:56:14.555]  This shows some servants giving up their humanity.
[01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:28.922]  Oh yeah, because they're like, you know what, this is their way of, they don't know that they're angry with their parents, they don't know, you know, these women need love and support and they're not going to be cured, I think, on their own.
[01:56:28.962 --> 01:56:32.626]  We have to, like, sometimes embrace these people and show them the way.
[01:56:32.646 --> 01:56:33.447]  We do.
[01:56:33.467 --> 01:56:35.388]  Let's see, I'm going to call in before we go to break.
[01:56:35.428 --> 01:56:36.930]  Who is up first here?
[01:56:39.191 --> 01:56:45.999]  Let's talk about Trump and the vaccines after the break, but let's talk about Andrew Tate and the interview coming up with Bart in Georgia.
[01:56:46.059 --> 01:56:46.660]  Bart, you're on the air.
[01:56:48.385 --> 01:56:48.925]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:49.885 --> 01:56:52.386]  There's a reason Andrew Tate got banned.
[01:56:52.426 --> 01:56:58.608]  He promotes heterosexuality, making money, and masculine strength.
[01:56:58.668 --> 01:57:03.829]  And what I'm about to say is really going to make something mad, but if this lady can talk about hand jobs, I should be able to say this.
[01:57:04.269 --> 01:57:09.771]  The reason Tate got banned from YouTube is because there's nothing but steers and queers there, and I don't see any horns.
[01:57:10.551 --> 01:57:11.491]  Steers and queers?
[01:57:11.892 --> 01:57:13.392]  That's funny.
[01:57:13.532 --> 01:57:16.813]  No, I mean, they're really afraid of men activating their power.
[01:57:17.443 --> 01:57:18.103]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:57:18.243 --> 01:57:30.868]  Men are super powerful and you need to hold them back and tell them that everything they do is, like, wanting to look good is gay, wanting to work out is alt-right, and they're just trying to thwart everything you do to better yourself.
[01:57:30.908 --> 01:57:32.269]  It's not like Andrew just acts tough.
[01:57:32.329 --> 01:57:35.470]  He's, like, fought all the top people in bare knuckles and beat their brains out.
[01:57:36.130 --> 01:57:37.592]  Like, they're afraid of him in the UFC.
[01:57:37.652 --> 01:57:38.252]  I mean, on record.
[01:57:38.373 --> 01:57:40.154]  Like, I mean, this guy's a killer.
[01:57:40.515 --> 01:57:40.715]  Wow.
[01:57:40.775 --> 01:57:41.356]  So is his brother.
[01:57:41.436 --> 01:57:42.016]  He's like 6'3".
[01:57:42.076 --> 01:57:42.817]  I met him in person.
[01:57:42.837 --> 01:57:44.819]  You're like, him and his brother, like, you know.
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:46.841]  I mean, it's like, these guys ain't messing around.
[01:57:46.981 --> 01:57:49.284]  That's somebody, you need a friend like that to help you move.
[01:57:49.404 --> 01:57:50.205]  Because they could help.
[01:57:50.245 --> 01:57:52.147]  They could carry a couch all by themselves.
[01:57:52.487 --> 01:57:53.028]  That's what I'm seeing.
[01:57:53.048 --> 01:57:53.929]  What else you want to say, Bart?
[01:57:55.003 --> 01:58:02.272]  I just wanted to tell Andrew Tate, I sent him an email and he responded saying he wasn't going to click on my link to my videos because I wasn't in the war room.
[01:58:02.352 --> 01:58:07.519]  I'm just appealing to Andrew Tate, go to Rumble and look at Bart Fine and check out some of my videos.
[01:58:07.799 --> 01:58:10.042]  I deserve to be on your podcast, Andrew, and you know it.
[01:58:10.791 --> 01:58:11.371]  It's beautiful.
[01:58:11.512 --> 01:58:15.114]  An Andrew Tate interview, hour long this morning, going to drop Monday.
[01:58:15.274 --> 01:58:17.195]  It was powerful.
[01:58:17.695 --> 01:58:18.656]  Look for that.
[01:58:18.676 --> 01:58:20.157]  All right, Chris Eaton, Mayor.
[01:58:20.557 --> 01:58:24.420]  We're going to come back, take more calls for a couple of segments, and Paul Watson's going to take over.
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:26.901]  But listen, he can barely do the next hour.
[01:58:27.742 --> 01:58:28.582]  I talked to him earlier.
[01:58:29.003 --> 01:58:31.364]  He said, man, I'm in such mourning right now over the Queen.
[01:58:32.825 --> 01:58:34.466]  Truth is, actually, Paul's become a royalist.
[01:58:34.506 --> 01:58:35.207]  I'm not joking, y'all.
[01:58:35.927 --> 01:58:37.188]  He's gone and hung out with these people.
[01:58:37.608 --> 01:58:38.769]  Not the Queen, but the other ones.
[01:58:39.310 --> 01:58:41.691]  So he's got... I love Paul, but he's said it himself.
[01:58:41.992 --> 01:58:43.473]  He has been sucked into this.
[01:58:44.173 --> 01:58:45.414]  And that's fine and dandy.
[01:58:45.794 --> 01:58:47.095]  It's a sophisticated issue.
[01:58:47.655 --> 01:58:50.898]  Hey, when Satan takes you up the high mountain, you know, what do you do?
[01:58:52.199 --> 01:58:52.899]  I throw him off.
[01:58:53.199 --> 01:58:53.740]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:55.041]  Stay with us.
[01:58:55.181 --> 01:58:56.582]  We are drugged out!
[01:58:57.242 --> 01:58:59.504]  We are following other people's opinions!
[01:59:00.669 --> 01:59:02.870]  We are controlled by the media.
[01:59:03.450 --> 01:59:05.011]  Today, it all changes.
[01:59:05.331 --> 01:59:07.812]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[01:59:08.072 --> 01:59:10.914]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[01:59:11.154 --> 01:59:15.716]  Einstein says the death and insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[01:59:15.896 --> 01:59:18.777]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
[01:59:19.017 --> 01:59:21.078]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[01:59:21.398 --> 01:59:23.339]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:59:23.819 --> 01:59:25.260]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:30.722]   We have the resources for Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:59:30.542 --> 01:59:33.542]  We need some crazy mother f***** to change something.
[01:59:33.542 --> 01:59:36.542]  Steve Jobs is crazy, now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[01:59:36.542 --> 01:59:38.542]  They say Trump's crazy, they say I'm crazy.
[01:59:38.542 --> 01:59:40.542]  But I'm here to show love.
[01:59:40.542 --> 01:59:44.542]   It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[01:59:44.542 --> 01:59:49.542]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:59:49.542 --> 01:59:52.542]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:59:57.542 --> 02:00:01.182]   I'm gonna lay something on the viewers' list, which is pretty heavy right now.
[02:00:01.807 --> 02:00:11.570]  There's the opposite side of being a victim and being a man, and you get to the point where you don't tell people what's going on and how you're being attacked, and it's almost a bad thing.
[02:00:12.871 --> 02:00:16.532]  Because, yeah, we're not victims, but we can't be so tough we don't tell you what's going on.
[02:00:18.733 --> 02:00:23.455]  Steve Bannon was scheduled to be on the show tomorrow, but he's been taken into custody with the new trumped-up charges.
[02:00:24.478 --> 02:00:25.199]  In New York.
[02:00:25.239 --> 02:00:26.039]  We're gonna play that audio.
[02:00:26.059 --> 02:00:26.380]  Get that audio.
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:27.320]  We're gonna play that next segment.
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:27.881]  Get that video.
[02:00:30.022 --> 02:00:32.504]  And Owen Troyer was with us at the Capitol.
[02:00:32.524 --> 02:00:33.825]  Tried to stop January 6th.
[02:00:34.786 --> 02:00:37.328]  And they filed in federal court and said he perjured himself.
[02:00:37.368 --> 02:00:38.449]  He doesn't work for InfoWars.
[02:00:38.469 --> 02:00:39.370]  They said it's a federal court.
[02:00:40.250 --> 02:00:41.752]  And they're trying to put him in jail for a couple years.
[02:00:42.792 --> 02:00:48.537]  And Owen can't be here routinely like this week because he's in court with them trying to put him in jail.
[02:00:49.565 --> 02:00:52.167]  Okay, so that's how real this is.
[02:00:52.227 --> 02:00:55.370]  We're so, I'll be quite frank, we're so tough, we're just like, okay, whatever.
[02:00:56.090 --> 02:00:59.333]  We're so close to being destroyed, but this is a battle of wills.
[02:00:59.393 --> 02:01:03.776]  You're holding us in place with your prayers, your word of mouth, and your financial support.
[02:01:04.817 --> 02:01:08.600]  But Steve Bannon surrenders to face New York indictment in wall case.
[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:15.325]  Got a couple hundred thousand dollars on tens of millions they raise to build part of the wall to show it could be done.
[02:01:15.905 --> 02:01:16.586]  That's free will.
[02:01:17.575 --> 02:01:20.156]  Any fundraiser, they admitted part of it was going to the show.
[02:01:20.216 --> 02:01:21.256]  What's wrong with that?
[02:01:21.996 --> 02:01:31.599]  You know, Hunter Biden can be a Chinese Communist agent and be with pedophilia and all the rest of it, and that's okay, but Steve Bannon raises money for a wall and keeps a few hundred grand.
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:33.880]  That's all the guys they've ever done.
[02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:35.401]  It's like 200 grand between like five people.
[02:01:36.121 --> 02:01:39.962]  I'm surprised that he plugged this wall for a year and got 200 grand.
[02:01:40.082 --> 02:01:44.583]  I mean, you can't pay for your bandwidth with 200 grand if you've got a popular show in a month.
[02:01:45.704 --> 02:01:52.367]   I just paid Yesterday, because Bandot Video is so popular, we've got one of the biggest streaming services, so we've got low rates.
[02:01:53.607 --> 02:01:59.369]  We had, let's not exaggerate, it was like 150 million views last month on Bandot Video.
[02:01:59.749 --> 02:02:01.129]  We may lower the quality of the stream.
[02:02:01.169 --> 02:02:02.630]  I'm telling everybody right now because I can't pay the bills.
[02:02:05.409 --> 02:02:08.731]  $287,000 yesterday.
[02:02:09.071 --> 02:02:08.731]  $287,000.
[02:02:09.291 --> 02:02:11.892]  So you say, just go build it yourself.
[02:02:11.952 --> 02:02:15.193]  Well, it takes money to do that, and it takes money to be successful.
[02:02:15.553 --> 02:02:24.017]  Steve Bannon, five people indicted for making $211,000 over a year.
[02:02:24.577 --> 02:02:26.218]  He's every day raising money.
[02:02:26.278 --> 02:02:30.199]  Millions built a wall, and they go, oh, you're a fraud.
[02:02:31.420 --> 02:02:34.081]  You raised money, and you kept part of it.
[02:02:35.478 --> 02:02:36.799]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:02:39.261 --> 02:02:46.046]  They shut down the NRA in New York because they got a private jet for the board to fly to their meeting in Florida?
[02:02:46.887 --> 02:02:52.591]  Oh, you can't fly on a private jet even though it's the same cost flying 10 board members as flying first class.
[02:02:52.952 --> 02:02:53.672]  This is sick.
[02:02:53.732 --> 02:02:55.133]  We should celebrate our people.
[02:02:55.434 --> 02:02:56.594]  We should support our people.
[02:02:56.635 --> 02:02:57.655]  We should back our people.
[02:02:57.976 --> 02:02:59.177]  This is disgusting.
[02:02:59.497 --> 02:03:01.658]  They're trying to put me in jail as well.
[02:03:02.119 --> 02:03:03.560]  Chrissy Mayer, your take on this?
[02:03:04.100 --> 02:03:15.585]  I just want to help you guys sell as much male vitality as possible, so I'm going to buy 10 cases, bring them home to my fiancé, bring them to the men in my life, and we're going to help you get through this.
[02:03:15.605 --> 02:03:17.866]  Well, it definitely works, but I mean, this is a big deal.
[02:03:18.706 --> 02:03:20.087]  This is political witch hunt stuff.
[02:03:20.532 --> 02:03:21.793]  Yeah, it's really disgusting.
[02:03:22.113 --> 02:03:25.815]  I mean, Trump pardoned him for the federal case on this.
[02:03:26.455 --> 02:03:30.077]  And I read the federal case, like $211,000 or whatever it was.
[02:03:30.877 --> 02:03:35.560]  Oh my gosh, they took money for, I mean, what?
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:40.503]  Meanwhile, how many billions of dollars has Hunter helped?
[02:03:40.523 --> 02:03:46.526]  But you tell people, Bono gives less than 1%.
[02:03:47.246 --> 02:03:48.747]  He's raised billions for African people.
[02:03:49.309 --> 02:03:49.969]  Bannon gives 95%!
[02:03:51.770 --> 02:03:52.591]  Salvation Army's like 85%!
[02:03:52.731 --> 02:03:56.512]  He gives 95% and then they're indicting him!
[02:03:56.532 --> 02:03:58.193]  I mean, what do you think charities do?
[02:03:58.573 --> 02:03:59.314]  Wow, yeah.
[02:03:59.454 --> 02:04:06.457]  I mean, it's like he can do no right because of who he's associated with and he's just, they'll just always see him as the enemy.
[02:04:06.477 --> 02:04:08.078]  Well, I read the indictment federally.
[02:04:08.098 --> 02:04:09.258]  I haven't read this new in the state.
[02:04:09.318 --> 02:04:11.799]  I mean, it was like, damn, he only kept 5%?
[02:04:11.879 --> 02:04:12.660]  Who can run on that?
[02:04:12.860 --> 02:04:14.060]  I mean, I mean.
[02:04:14.981 --> 02:04:15.781]  Yeah, that's really low.
[02:04:16.822 --> 02:04:17.302]  That's crazy.
[02:04:18.004 --> 02:04:22.488]  I mean, I probably get 10% of what comes in here.
[02:04:22.988 --> 02:04:23.989]  It's my operation.
[02:04:24.810 --> 02:04:26.892]  But I don't want to spend all of it on lawyers.
[02:04:27.932 --> 02:04:28.753]  I don't care.
[02:04:28.833 --> 02:04:31.896]  It's just insane how they don't want us to have an infrastructure.
[02:04:32.536 --> 02:04:33.837]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:04:33.917 --> 02:04:38.742]  Maybe they just want him to get desperate and start an OnlyFans, but I don't know.
[02:04:39.462 --> 02:04:40.403]  He's never going to do that.
[02:04:40.843 --> 02:04:41.444]  I love Bannon.
[02:04:42.211 --> 02:04:44.994]  And, you know, I love Roger Stone, I love all these guys.
[02:04:45.014 --> 02:04:46.935]  We've been persecuted together, but it's been hardcore.
[02:04:46.996 --> 02:04:47.956]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:04:48.397 --> 02:04:55.924]  But you've got a lot of people supporting you and helping you and behind you and, you know, there's an army of people that are behind you.
[02:04:55.984 --> 02:05:01.408]  It's just, you know, it's probably easy to forget because so many people are coming after you all the time.
[02:05:01.428 --> 02:05:02.109]  Well, I just want to be clear.
[02:05:02.129 --> 02:05:08.495]  Owen Schroer is facing, on two charges, nine months and nine months, so that's 18 months in federal jail.
[02:05:10.037 --> 02:05:18.309]   For being at the Capitol peacefully and we've already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars offending him and It's just sick.
[02:05:18.429 --> 02:05:24.354]  I mean, you read a federal response, like, Owen Schreier purging himself, we want charges, federal judge.
[02:05:24.674 --> 02:05:25.815]  He doesn't work at Infowars.
[02:05:26.016 --> 02:05:27.197]  He's on three hours a day!
[02:05:27.997 --> 02:05:29.118]  He's been here six years!
[02:05:29.799 --> 02:05:30.359]  It's unbelievable.
[02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:33.222]  I mean, it's like saying, Mickey Mouse is not part of Disney.
[02:05:33.342 --> 02:05:36.465]  I mean, it's, Superman is not part of Marvel Comics.
[02:05:37.105 --> 02:05:39.808]  It's the, when you read that, it's like, who are these people?
[02:05:40.108 --> 02:05:42.971]  How do, because they get away with lying and fraud constantly.
[02:05:43.411 --> 02:05:44.211]  It's so disgusting.
[02:05:44.271 --> 02:05:45.371]  I was at January 6, too.
[02:05:45.411 --> 02:05:45.971]  I was outside.
[02:05:45.991 --> 02:05:47.172]  I was doing interviews.
[02:05:47.212 --> 02:05:58.794]  I was just doing, like, man-on-the-street stuff, and I still... I have people still today, like, tagging in my DMs, tagging Twitter, like, at FBI, come get your girl, and it's... I mean, I made jokes out of it.
[02:05:58.834 --> 02:06:05.995]  I'm trying to make the best of it, but people are relentless, and it's disgusting how anyone involved with that day is being so vilified.
[02:06:06.495 --> 02:06:08.475]  Let's talk to New Orleans, Louisiana.
[02:06:09.195 --> 02:06:10.796]  Let's talk to Greg and then Aaron.
[02:06:10.916 --> 02:06:11.656]  Greg, you're on the air.
[02:06:11.676 --> 02:06:11.916]  Go ahead.
[02:06:13.413 --> 02:06:14.153]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:06:14.393 --> 02:06:15.354]  It's great to speak with you.
[02:06:15.874 --> 02:06:16.915]  I'm in the arena, brother.
[02:06:17.295 --> 02:06:17.655]  Thank you.
[02:06:18.455 --> 02:06:22.957]  I've been listening to you for 12 years, and I've been your customer for 12 years.
[02:06:23.197 --> 02:06:23.637]  It's great.
[02:06:23.697 --> 02:06:24.558]  Love all your products.
[02:06:24.738 --> 02:06:25.378]  Thank you.
[02:06:25.998 --> 02:06:27.179]  Alex Jones is right.
[02:06:27.239 --> 02:06:27.499]  T-shirt.
[02:06:27.519 --> 02:06:27.799]  Love it.
[02:06:27.979 --> 02:06:29.260]  I'm going to be wearing that.
[02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:35.102]  I got about six of your barber stickers on the back of my car, and I do Uber Eats around New Orleans.
[02:06:35.783 --> 02:06:40.325]  And I'm telling you, man, everybody should do it because your rear view mirror becomes like an entertainment center.
[02:06:43.023 --> 02:06:47.385]  I've seen everything from people giving thumbs up, the bird finger, and it just gets a lot of attention.
[02:06:48.346 --> 02:06:57.611]  And this guy actually gave me a job, he stopped me in a Popeyes drive-thru, and he offered me a job because he liked the bumper sticker so much.
[02:06:57.751 --> 02:07:03.255]  Oh yeah, wearing an InfoWars shirt, sporting an InfoWars sticker, is like joining the adventure.
[02:07:03.395 --> 02:07:06.436]  I mean, it's not a lie, it's real.
[02:07:07.977 --> 02:07:08.578]  Absolutely.
[02:07:09.793 --> 02:07:11.754]  But I wanted to bring up Trump.
[02:07:12.714 --> 02:07:17.935]  I believe you did give him a September 23rd deadline to say something about this?
[02:07:18.155 --> 02:07:18.375]  Yep.
[02:07:18.916 --> 02:07:20.136]  It doesn't matter.
[02:07:20.156 --> 02:07:21.856]  He contacted me and said, fuck you.
[02:07:21.876 --> 02:07:22.197]  Excuse me.
[02:07:22.477 --> 02:07:23.757]  He said, shut up.
[02:07:23.857 --> 02:07:25.217]  I don't want to hear from you now.
[02:07:25.658 --> 02:07:27.098]  I already got a response back in two days.
[02:07:28.318 --> 02:07:30.339]  He said, I don't want to hear from you again.
[02:07:30.359 --> 02:07:31.279]  Wow.
[02:07:32.219 --> 02:07:35.380]  Yeah, this is like paramount times.
[02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:37.781]  I can't imagine what that man must be going through.
[02:07:38.382 --> 02:07:41.364]  Well, I'm a born-again Christian and I can tell you that I feel the power of God like never before, okay?
[02:07:41.384 --> 02:07:41.624]  I do too.
[02:07:41.444 --> 02:07:45.604]   all of it. I want to support him but the shots poison. Nine out of ten die and took it.
[02:07:45.604 --> 02:07:49.524]   So I just, it's a deal breaker. I mean I can't sign on. Now they're giving six month old
[02:07:49.524 --> 02:07:53.644]   babies so I mean some of the listeners are pissed that I'm being mad at Trump but I mean
[02:07:53.644 --> 02:07:58.323]   I don't know what I'm supposed to do here. Well I'm a born again Christian and I can
[02:07:58.323 --> 02:08:01.364]  tell you that I feel the power of God like never before.
[02:08:01.364 --> 02:08:05.323]  Okay. I do too. Isn't it incredible?
[02:08:05.323 --> 02:08:06.404]  It's so, oh wonderful.
[02:08:06.406 --> 02:08:09.167]  It's like, you know, the scripture says, Isaiah 59, 19.
[02:08:10.487 --> 02:08:15.788]  So shall they fear in the name of the Lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun.
[02:08:15.928 --> 02:08:20.229]  When the enemy comes and shall come in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard against them.
[02:08:20.569 --> 02:08:22.389]  That is so true right now, right Alex?
[02:08:22.409 --> 02:08:23.889]  Because I've heard you say it so many times.
[02:08:24.529 --> 02:08:25.430]  They are attacking.
[02:08:25.630 --> 02:08:28.270]  We are the standard of the spirit of the Lord.
[02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:29.170]  Think about that.
[02:08:29.450 --> 02:08:30.471]  This is real, folks.
[02:08:33.513 --> 02:08:35.455]  So I'm like this obscure artist.
[02:08:36.856 --> 02:08:39.478]  I did, I've done something I wanted you to see if it's possible.
[02:08:40.779 --> 02:08:43.020]  I'm Gregory Shedman on Facebook.
[02:08:43.441 --> 02:08:46.863]  If you look at the header, it's this painting called Daters at Monopoly.
[02:08:47.784 --> 02:08:50.846]  And I just hope you get to see it.
[02:08:50.946 --> 02:08:53.869]  I think I talked to Christy Lee about a month ago.
[02:08:54.129 --> 02:08:55.350]  I'll look it up.
[02:08:55.410 --> 02:08:56.971]  Tell us, tell us on Facebook what it is.
[02:08:58.072 --> 02:08:59.373]  So my name is Gregory.
[02:09:00.544 --> 02:09:02.985]  Shevnin, and it's a Russian name, but I'm not Russian.
[02:09:03.025 --> 02:09:04.686]  I found that out before my family.
[02:09:04.726 --> 02:09:05.166]  It's okay.
[02:09:05.326 --> 02:09:06.106]  We'll look it up, brother.
[02:09:06.146 --> 02:09:06.426]  Love you.
[02:09:06.446 --> 02:09:07.427]  Appreciate your call.
[02:09:07.487 --> 02:09:09.487]  I love listener information.
[02:09:09.988 --> 02:09:17.671]  We're gonna go to break and make a few more calls to our special guest, Chrissy Mayer, and then Paul Joseph Watson, who is deep in mourning right now.
[02:09:18.171 --> 02:09:18.931]  Probably actually is.
[02:09:19.551 --> 02:09:20.352]  Paul's a great guy.
[02:09:20.372 --> 02:09:20.692]  I love Paul.
[02:09:20.712 --> 02:09:21.272]  I've known him 20 years.
[02:09:21.712 --> 02:09:22.412]  And he's a Royalist.
[02:09:23.513 --> 02:09:26.774]  And, uh, so we'll see what he has to say about the Queen of England.
[02:09:27.334 --> 02:09:29.075]  They say she's as dead as a doornail.
[02:09:30.106 --> 02:09:34.549]  Well, Paul Joseph Watson takes over next hour in just a few minutes.
[02:09:35.969 --> 02:09:37.130]  The Queen of England has died.
[02:09:37.170 --> 02:09:38.711]  He'll give us his take on that and more.
[02:09:39.471 --> 02:09:43.334]  But right now, Chrissy Mayer, well-known comedian, is with us in the studio.
[02:09:43.374 --> 02:09:44.614]  We're taking phone calls.
[02:09:45.455 --> 02:09:49.497]  And let's go ahead and take a call right now from one of these great callers.
[02:09:50.758 --> 02:09:52.219]  And my phone system just crashed.
[02:09:52.279 --> 02:09:52.739]  Oh, there it is.
[02:09:53.619 --> 02:10:00.323]   So, let's go ahead and take a call from Aaron in New Mexico.
[02:10:00.364 --> 02:10:00.890]  Go ahead, Aaron.
[02:10:04.443 --> 02:10:08.385]  I'm calling in because I found a free radio app that plays your show.
[02:10:08.526 --> 02:10:11.707]  It's downloadable on Google Android and Apple Stores.
[02:10:12.128 --> 02:10:14.689]  It loops the Alex Jones Show 24-7.
[02:10:15.210 --> 02:10:17.331]  It's called Simple Radio.
[02:10:17.871 --> 02:10:19.472]  It has thousands of radio channels.
[02:10:19.652 --> 02:10:22.834]  InfoWars has a channel, so search InfoWars.
[02:10:23.435 --> 02:10:30.359]  The Alex Jones Show starts live every day and it loops the show until the next one when you come on air.
[02:10:30.719 --> 02:10:32.280]  Simple Radio, alright!
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:33.340]  Yep.
[02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:42.324]  It only plays InfoWars commercials, so go download Simple Radio, find the InfoWars channel, and listen to Alex Jones Show today.
[02:10:42.345 --> 02:10:44.285]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:10:44.686 --> 02:10:50.749]  I want to also add, just like Judge Gamble said to you, your beliefs do not make something true.
[02:10:51.129 --> 02:10:55.471]  We should parrot that same argument for the transgender dysphoria, you know?
[02:10:57.176 --> 02:10:57.676]  No, I agree.
[02:10:57.697 --> 02:11:01.800]  Like this headline, almost a quarter of Democrats believe men can get pregnant.
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:03.881]  Their beliefs don't make something true.
[02:11:04.642 --> 02:11:05.122]  Exactly.
[02:11:05.383 --> 02:11:05.563]  Yep.
[02:11:06.023 --> 02:11:12.228]  And God bless Steve Bannon, Owen Schroeder, and all the political prisoners in USA, DeSantis 2024, baby.
[02:11:12.288 --> 02:11:12.788]  Let's go.
[02:11:12.808 --> 02:11:13.829]  Thank you.
[02:11:13.849 --> 02:11:14.530]  Well, you're beautiful.
[02:11:14.570 --> 02:11:15.410]  Don't hang up, Erin.
[02:11:15.451 --> 02:11:17.132]  What else do you make of this crazy world?
[02:11:18.922 --> 02:11:23.564]  It's quite interesting, all the turn of events that we're kind of seeing right now.
[02:11:25.105 --> 02:11:29.748]  I was behind Trump, but now I think we should be pushing a new candidate.
[02:11:30.068 --> 02:11:37.452]  I've also been thinking InfoWars should hold a little voting poll, DeSantis or Trump, who should we run?
[02:11:38.032 --> 02:11:44.396]  Or something to that effect, to get some kind of a message out there that there's a mass of people that want change.
[02:11:45.567 --> 02:11:46.028]  I agree.
[02:11:46.489 --> 02:11:51.996]  That's what I did going out against Trump with the vaccine, is to get him to wake up or to make it all about the Santas.
[02:11:52.437 --> 02:11:53.758]  We are the grassroots.
[02:11:53.778 --> 02:11:57.503]  We've got to pressure Trump and the Santas and other leaders to do the right thing.
[02:11:57.944 --> 02:11:58.645]  Beautiful point.
[02:11:58.725 --> 02:12:00.648]  God bless you, Erin, from New Mexico.
[02:12:00.748 --> 02:12:02.911]  Thank you so much for calling us today.
[02:12:04.042 --> 02:12:07.543]  Alright, in closing, Christy Mayer, what else do you want to add to these viewers?
[02:12:08.203 --> 02:12:10.244]  Yeah, thank you guys so much for watching.
[02:12:10.344 --> 02:12:11.804]  Alex, you're such an inspiration to me.
[02:12:12.445 --> 02:12:16.046]  Check out my album live from January 6th on Amazon and iTunes.
[02:12:16.206 --> 02:12:19.267]  I'll be headlining tonight at the Cap City Comedy Club.
[02:12:19.347 --> 02:12:24.748]  Come on out, have some laughs, have some drinks, but don't hit on me because I'm engaged.
[02:12:24.768 --> 02:12:26.969]  Oh my goodness.
[02:12:28.650 --> 02:12:29.230]  You probably can.
[02:12:29.450 --> 02:12:29.770]  I don't know.
[02:12:30.999 --> 02:12:33.982]  So, but in closing, what else are you focusing on with your comedy?
[02:12:34.283 --> 02:12:35.344]  Do one minute of your comedy.
[02:12:35.404 --> 02:12:36.926]  Oh my goodness.
[02:12:37.046 --> 02:12:37.466]  Okay.
[02:12:37.887 --> 02:12:44.755]  Well, um, you know, I did before my current fiance, I was in a, in an interracial relationship.
[02:12:44.855 --> 02:12:46.837]  My last boyfriend was Dutch.
[02:12:47.978 --> 02:12:50.419]  Not ethnically, he just never paid for anything.
[02:12:50.740 --> 02:12:54.722]  So, and I was like, don't, I don't want, I don't want a sugar daddy.
[02:12:54.862 --> 02:12:56.403]  I, you know, I never wanted a sugar daddy.
[02:12:56.423 --> 02:13:00.045]  I don't need someone to pay for everything, but I think the next step down would be nice.
[02:13:00.125 --> 02:13:02.886]  Not quite a sugar daddy, but like a PayPal.
[02:13:03.166 --> 02:13:08.089]  I would be okay with, like, just to pick up the little things, like the extra, the extra drink.
[02:13:08.309 --> 02:13:10.630]  Yeah, feminism is about having a man like he's a pet.
[02:13:11.271 --> 02:13:13.192]  You pick up his crap, you feed him.
[02:13:13.945 --> 02:13:14.946]  No, I love men.
[02:13:14.966 --> 02:13:15.887]  I love men.
[02:13:15.947 --> 02:13:16.568]  Men are the best.
[02:13:16.648 --> 02:13:18.509]  No, but like other liberal systems, the men do nothing.
[02:13:18.770 --> 02:13:19.590]  Oh, for sure.
[02:13:19.651 --> 02:13:23.795]  Yeah, they just sit there and they want women to just have the men hold their purse and...
[02:13:24.738 --> 02:13:27.339]  Just demoralize them until they opt out.
[02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:29.620]  But the women are incredibly unhappy, though.
[02:13:29.941 --> 02:13:31.561]  They're super unhappy, and they don't know why.
[02:13:31.581 --> 02:13:35.383]  It's because they've been tricked into wasting their lives on feminism.
[02:13:35.543 --> 02:13:39.365]  But all their genetics are about looking for an alpha to make the species better.
[02:13:39.385 --> 02:13:39.545]  Right.
[02:13:39.586 --> 02:13:43.788]  You get tricked into getting on birth control, and it screws up your picker.
[02:13:44.468 --> 02:13:45.769]  Your body thinks you're pregnant 24-7.
[02:13:45.869 --> 02:13:52.192]  You end up picking a much more sensitive, like a different type of man than you normally would go for if your hormones were in line.
[02:13:52.572 --> 02:13:57.054]  And women are on birth control their whole lives and they don't realize it screws up with your mood, it screws up.
[02:13:57.094 --> 02:13:59.314]  It's a biological, psychological attack.
[02:13:59.575 --> 02:14:01.835]  Yeah, I want to get, women need to get off birth control.
[02:14:01.855 --> 02:14:03.096]  Chrissy Mayer, thank you so much.
[02:14:03.116 --> 02:14:04.076]  Great to have you in the studio.
[02:14:04.656 --> 02:14:05.357]  Glad you came here.
[02:14:05.377 --> 02:14:07.737]  I'm going to introduce Paul Watson, who's deep in mourning.
[02:14:08.338 --> 02:14:09.598]  The Queen Elizabeth has died.
[02:14:09.998 --> 02:14:11.219]  Paul may not be able to host this.
[02:14:11.279 --> 02:14:11.759]  Stay with us.
[02:14:13.106 --> 02:14:14.647]  The facts and common sense are in.
[02:14:14.787 --> 02:14:16.429]  Yes, there have been corrupt empires.
[02:14:16.569 --> 02:14:17.670]  Yes, they manipulate.
[02:14:17.810 --> 02:14:19.491]  Yes, there are secret societies.
[02:14:19.831 --> 02:14:21.933]  Yes, there have been oligarchies throughout history.
[02:14:22.253 --> 02:14:37.383]   And yes, today, in 2002, there is a tyrannical organization calling itself The New World Order pushing for worldwide government, a cashless society, total and complete tyranny.
[02:14:37.803 --> 02:14:44.547]  By centralizing and socializing health care, the state becomes God, basically, when it comes to your health.
[02:14:44.887 --> 02:14:54.532]  And then by releasing diseases and viruses and plagues upon us, we then basically get shoved into their system, where human beings are absolutely worthless.
[02:14:56.144 --> 02:15:00.228]  Alright, Paul Joseph Watson from England is taking over right now.
[02:15:01.049 --> 02:15:03.171]  The Queen of England, Queen Elizabeth II, has died at 96.
[02:15:05.293 --> 02:15:07.655]  And people can celebrate that, but I'm not celebrating it.
[02:15:08.156 --> 02:15:14.402]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, Prince Charles, Charles III, is about to be the King of England.
[02:15:14.942 --> 02:15:17.485]  So, Paul, obviously the Queen was more conservative.
[02:15:18.715 --> 02:15:26.877]  Our son is a globalist, and I know you live there, you know these people, you've interviewed these people, you're involved in it, you've told us on air you're more of a royalist now.
[02:15:27.637 --> 02:15:36.620]  What on earth do you expect from this and King Charles III, and how long will he be king before his son becomes king, Paul?
[02:15:39.041 --> 02:15:47.963]  Well, I reckon he'll be king for quite a while, because he's only 73 years old at the moment, so I reckon, you know, given their lineage, he's probably got a good two decades or more left.
[02:15:48.652 --> 02:15:49.933]  But yeah, it's a sad time.
[02:15:49.993 --> 02:15:53.376]  Obviously the Queen is an icon, a representation of Britain.
[02:15:53.936 --> 02:15:57.899]  She's been on the throne since 1952, over 70 years.
[02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:04.585]  And the country's changed a lot, a hell of a lot, it's almost unrecognisable in some places, since 1952.
[02:16:05.946 --> 02:16:12.851]  So for her to pass, it's kind of a passing of something far more monumental than just the Queen as an individual.
[02:16:13.432 --> 02:16:20.407]   We had a Jubilee celebration back in June, For her 70th year on the throne.
[02:16:21.167 --> 02:16:21.888]  And it was weird.
[02:16:21.908 --> 02:16:23.668]  It didn't feel like a celebration.
[02:16:23.728 --> 02:16:29.471]  It felt like more kind of a wake for the country that she represented that is now being lost.
[02:16:30.091 --> 02:16:33.833]  Thanks to, you know, massive political polarization.
[02:16:33.893 --> 02:16:40.756]  Thanks to mass immigration that's continually changed the identity of entire areas of the country.
[02:16:41.336 --> 02:16:42.997]  So it is sad in a way.
[02:16:44.053 --> 02:16:58.183]  Of course, the vilest people you can imagine, the anti-racists, the anti-colonialists, despite the fact that the Queen decolonised much of the world, are out on Twitter celebrating it feverishly, popping champagne corks.
[02:16:58.223 --> 02:17:03.707]  So, to align with those kind of people, I want to steer well away from that because, you know, it is sad.
[02:17:03.727 --> 02:17:17.171]   I'm not devastated because I wasn't intimately tied in with supporting the Royal Family, but For the country, it does mark the passing of a time which was very different to what Britain manifests itself as today.
[02:17:17.252 --> 02:17:23.421]  So in that sense, it does feel quite monumental, whether you like the royalty of the monarchy or not.
[02:17:24.082 --> 02:17:25.484]  Paul, I totally agree with you.
[02:17:26.024 --> 02:17:27.285]  And this is very nuanced.
[02:17:27.726 --> 02:17:29.728]  They demonize the British royal family.
[02:17:30.269 --> 02:17:31.150]  They attack it.
[02:17:31.450 --> 02:17:32.491]  The left hates it.
[02:17:32.511 --> 02:17:38.557]  So that makes us as conservatives or nationalists or Christians or populists want to then support it.
[02:17:38.577 --> 02:17:39.779]  I don't think she was a bad person.
[02:17:40.680 --> 02:17:41.901]  I totally agree with what you're saying.
[02:17:42.181 --> 02:17:44.003]  So I'm sad the Queen of England died.
[02:17:44.023 --> 02:17:45.565]  I think overall she was probably a good person.
[02:17:47.003 --> 02:17:52.732]  The longest living monarch in world history, from the numbers we have, not just British history, 70 years.
[02:17:53.493 --> 02:17:54.855]  And so this is a big deal.
[02:17:55.596 --> 02:18:02.366]  But just because the left attacks her doesn't mean I support the whole structure that's now taken over the British Empire.
[02:18:03.127 --> 02:18:04.888]  And what is behind it?
[02:18:05.309 --> 02:18:19.197]  And so I'm really concerned about Prince Charles and his whole globalist carbon tax new world order system coming in so we can talk about the Queen being dead all day long and the left celebrating it and I agree.
[02:18:19.557 --> 02:18:30.793]   They vestigially see her as the enemy and that is the enemy for them but She was really the head of state and presided over the breakup of the UK and this whole third world invasion.
[02:18:30.853 --> 02:18:36.836]  So I don't want to completely abscond her or separate her from that guilt.
[02:18:37.196 --> 02:18:38.276]  Don't speak ill of the dead.
[02:18:38.376 --> 02:18:38.897]  I get that.
[02:18:39.017 --> 02:18:41.978]  I'm just saying she could have done a lot more.
[02:18:43.047 --> 02:18:44.968]  Against the UN replacement migration.
[02:18:44.988 --> 02:18:46.649]  And so that's my issue.
[02:18:46.709 --> 02:18:47.810]  I know the left's celebrating it.
[02:18:47.930 --> 02:18:48.670]  I'm not with them.
[02:18:49.010 --> 02:18:50.031]  They hate nationalism.
[02:18:50.051 --> 02:18:50.891]  They hate sovereignty.
[02:18:51.292 --> 02:18:53.633]  Even though the Windsor's not really British.
[02:18:53.653 --> 02:18:54.353]  She's a little British.
[02:18:54.654 --> 02:18:55.294]  Mainly German.
[02:18:55.334 --> 02:18:56.495]  Mainly Hungarian.
[02:18:56.575 --> 02:18:57.115]  Romanian.
[02:18:58.236 --> 02:18:59.156]  Dracula, literally.
[02:18:59.176 --> 02:19:01.317]  I get that they're the symbol of it.
[02:19:01.357 --> 02:19:02.558]  So we love the UK.
[02:19:02.578 --> 02:19:03.198]  We love Britain.
[02:19:03.238 --> 02:19:03.819]  We love England.
[02:19:04.079 --> 02:19:05.620]  One of the most storied cultures in the world.
[02:19:05.940 --> 02:19:07.441]  I'm not an Anglophile.
[02:19:07.481 --> 02:19:09.322]  But I mean, if I'm anything, that's my roots.
[02:19:09.822 --> 02:19:16.460]   But at the same time, Paul, It's like she's being attacked, but she also went along with it.
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:17.661]  So I'm going to let you take over.
[02:19:17.681 --> 02:19:18.742]  I'm going to be listening.
[02:19:19.523 --> 02:19:23.185]  But how do we deal with the royal family presiding over all this?
[02:19:23.265 --> 02:19:27.288]  And now, if you didn't like Queen Elizabeth, man, I love her compared to Prince Charles.
[02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:32.872]  Speaking of Prince Charles, who really is his father's son when it comes to the population.
[02:19:33.113 --> 02:19:34.814]  Paul Joseph Watson of Summit.News.
[02:19:36.624 --> 02:19:37.104]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:19:37.144 --> 02:19:43.548]  Yeah, it gets back to the whole debate of whether the royal family's ceremonial or they actually exercise any power.
[02:19:43.568 --> 02:19:47.390]  Of course, they own a lot of land in the United Kingdom.
[02:19:47.450 --> 02:19:49.511]  They still exercise dominion in that way.
[02:19:50.091 --> 02:20:07.347]   But I think what you will see, and it'll be interesting, the early statements and manoeuvres that Prince Charles makes is the contrast between how interfering he is as a sovereign in the affairs of a country, which you can argue Is a good thing or a bad thing, depending on whether you agree with him.
[02:20:07.387 --> 02:20:08.408]  It's very hypocritical.
[02:20:08.968 --> 02:20:21.478]  But then on the side of the Queen, you could argue that she tried to stay out of state affairs, and maybe she shouldn't have stayed out to such a degree, given how much the country has changed since she sat on the throne.
[02:20:21.498 --> 02:20:26.342]  But again, that is a debate that will follow in the next few days and weeks.
[02:20:27.543 --> 02:20:30.065]  Obviously, King Charles III has been named.
[02:20:31.235 --> 02:20:35.121]  As the new Sovereign of England, tributes are flooding in.
[02:20:35.301 --> 02:20:42.872]  One person who was notable by his absence in offering tributes or at least concern as the Queen was dying.
[02:20:42.932 --> 02:20:47.519]  Now, I think what actually happened, the rumours were flying and this seems to make a lot of sense.
[02:20:48.146 --> 02:20:49.826]  The Queen actually died last night.
[02:20:49.906 --> 02:20:51.667]  She probably died last night in her sleep.
[02:20:52.107 --> 02:21:03.030]  The last public appearance for the Queen was on Tuesday, when she, uh, approved, swore in the new Prime Minister, Liz Truss, and she was on camera shaking the hands of the new Prime Minister.
[02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:05.310]  I mean, obviously looked frail.
[02:21:05.530 --> 02:21:12.652]  She's 96 years old, but didn't look too bad, and that was only on Tuesday, so she must have rapidly declined in the past 36 hours.
[02:21:14.088 --> 02:21:16.129]  Apparently, probably died last night.
[02:21:16.489 --> 02:21:38.454]  The doctors then came out with a statement saying they were deeply concerned, which was basically a red flag, an indication to get the machinery of government and of media into gear to prepare the population for this announcement, which it probably happened last night, but they delayed the announcement until about 6.30pm today.
[02:21:38.474 --> 02:21:41.434]  And it has been announced that the Queen is dead.
[02:21:41.715 --> 02:21:51.408]   Donald Trump has come out with a statement From him and former First Lady Melania Trump, said Melania and I are deeply saddened to learn of the loss of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
[02:21:51.868 --> 02:21:55.910]  Together with our family and fellow Americans, we send our sincere condolences to the Royal Family.
[02:21:57.010 --> 02:22:05.493]  The best statement actually, if you are moved by this, which a lot of people are in this country, it's a monumental occasion, actually was by Boris Johnson.
[02:22:05.933 --> 02:22:09.934]  Not the most popular person in the country right now, from either the left or the right.
[02:22:10.925 --> 02:22:19.055]  But he said, and he's a very good writer, whatever you want to say about Boris Johnson and his record in government, he's always been an outstanding writer, he said this.
[02:22:20.116 --> 02:22:22.018]  This is our country's saddest day.
[02:22:22.179 --> 02:22:25.803]  In the hearts of every one of us there is an ache at the passing of our Queen.
[02:22:25.923 --> 02:22:29.948]  A deep and personal sense of loss far more intense perhaps than we expected.
[02:22:31.149 --> 02:22:41.294]  Went on to say, in these first grim moments since the news, I know that millions and millions of people will be pausing whatever they have been doing to think about Queen Elizabeth, about the bright and shining light that's finally gone out.
[02:22:42.014 --> 02:22:42.655]  And that's it!
[02:22:43.615 --> 02:22:55.341]  Whether you're into the monarchy or not, when somebody is a part of the fabric of the country, they become a part of your life for decades and decades and decades, given that she's been on the throne, as I said, for 70 years.
[02:22:56.559 --> 02:23:10.935]  So whenever somebody dies like that, you don't even need to have a personal connection with them, don't need to necessarily like them or the institution that they represent, to feel that monumental shifting in the nation, in the culture, in the world.
[02:23:12.036 --> 02:23:21.591]   I mentioned it briefly earlier, Breitbart reports US professor hopes Queen of, quote, raping genocidal empire is in excruciating pain.
[02:23:21.671 --> 02:23:27.941]  This was a tweet put out about five hours ago, shortly before Queen Elizabeth died, or at least the announcement was made.
[02:23:28.524 --> 02:23:38.353]  This was a Nigerian-born professor at Carnegie Mellon University who said, quote, I heard the chief monarch of a thieving, raping, genocidal empire is finally dying.
[02:23:38.393 --> 02:23:39.855]  May her pain be excruciating.
[02:23:40.395 --> 02:23:47.622]  Aside from the whole debate, she actually decolonized the empire, whether you want to agree that the British Empire was a force for good or not.
[02:23:47.822 --> 02:23:48.443]  I agree.
[02:23:48.463 --> 02:23:50.144]  I would argue it was mainly a force for good.
[02:23:51.145 --> 02:24:00.456]   But again, what kind of sick, What individual do you need to be to immediately get on Twitter when you hear of this news and celebrate it and hope somebody dies in pain?
[02:24:00.516 --> 02:24:02.197]  This is the anti-racist left.
[02:24:02.257 --> 02:24:03.357]  We'll be back, don't go away.
[02:24:03.597 --> 02:24:08.599]  Well, I'm going to get into the energy crisis in a moment, but I knew it would happen.
[02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:16.543]  The national broadcaster, the BBC, is busy in response to the death of the Queen of England literally an hour ago.
[02:24:17.507 --> 02:24:20.790]  Droning on about diversity and white privilege.
[02:24:20.850 --> 02:24:32.740]  That's their response as the national broadcaster in league with, by the way, this Carnegie Mellon professor who said she hoped the Queen had died in excruciating pain.
[02:24:32.760 --> 02:24:38.965]  A lot of other world leaders were paying tribute to the Queen, hoping for her recovery before she died.
[02:24:39.086 --> 02:24:41.748]  Joe Biden didn't even bother to put a tweet out, by the way.
[02:24:42.580 --> 02:24:49.124]  But now, BBC Radio 4, this is the national broadcaster on the day the Queen of the country of 70 years died.
[02:24:50.732 --> 02:25:02.675]  Is busy telling us, this is a tweet by Sam Ashworth Hayes, about how the monarchy is at odds with society which values equality, diversity, inclusivity, while the monarchy is about white inherited privilege.
[02:25:02.715 --> 02:25:13.478]  Again, they can't go two friggin hours after the Queen of England dies without banging on about anti-racism and white privilege.
[02:25:13.758 --> 02:25:15.379]  It's an absolute cult.
[02:25:16.255 --> 02:25:22.162]  And the national broadcaster within hours of the death of the Queen is engaging in it.
[02:25:22.382 --> 02:25:23.363]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:25:23.403 --> 02:25:25.686]  That should be a scandal in and of itself.
[02:25:25.706 --> 02:25:49.878]   Let's get on to the energy crisis now though because we've had this announcement by the new Prime Minister Liz Truss that basically the government is going to pay Two-thirds of people's energy bills, they're going to cap the energy bills which were set to rise to £6,500 a year, even beyond that, that's about $9,000 a year, by next spring.
[02:25:50.438 --> 02:25:56.740]  Governments come out and announce that they're going to cap that at £2,500, basically by paying off the energy companies.
[02:25:57.401 --> 02:26:09.251]  Where that money's coming from, we all know where it's coming from, crippling future taxes, crippling future inflation, more money printing, more devaluation of the currency.
[02:26:09.651 --> 02:26:14.355]  No one really cares about that right now because they think it's a magic money tree that has no consequences.
[02:26:14.975 --> 02:26:51.956]   But what came out earlier in the week before this, and we're going to go to this video in a second explaining it further, a strange time in the UK, Is one of the primary reasons for the government giving this mass handout to individuals to pay their energy bills, and I'm not saying that people weren't going to struggle, that people weren't going to righteously steal food if they needed to to feed their families, but one of the main reasons the government handed out this money, which will run into the hundreds of billions over the course of the next two or three years by the way, is because the police across the country
[02:26:52.688 --> 02:26:58.451]  And the headline is, UK Police Prepare for Breakdown in Public Order Caused by Cost of Living Crisis.
[02:26:59.332 --> 02:27:09.777]  The police across the country told them that people will riot in huge numbers and start looting shops if the government doesn't give them a massive handout.
[02:27:10.458 --> 02:27:19.833]   Now again, We've had looting, we've had mass rioting in England as little as 10 years ago with the London riots, riots that spread to other major cities.
[02:27:20.293 --> 02:27:33.241]  At the time, the metropolitan elite progressive media came out with this narrative that it was righteous re-appropriation of wealth, that it was just poor people struggling desperately, having to steal merely to live.
[02:27:33.861 --> 02:27:35.162]  Absolute bollocks!
[02:27:35.803 --> 02:27:40.767]   It was People stealing Air Jordans from Foot Locker.
[02:27:41.048 --> 02:27:42.649]  That was the vast majority of it.
[02:27:42.930 --> 02:27:45.553]  It was people smashing into electronic stores.
[02:27:45.933 --> 02:27:49.417]  It was people smashing into off licenses and stealing alcohol.
[02:27:49.937 --> 02:27:58.287]  It was a feral criminal underclass, which we've had in this country for decades, partly because of unintegrated diversity.
[02:27:59.608 --> 02:28:01.148]  Stealing things which they didn't need.
[02:28:01.629 --> 02:28:09.211]  Criminal opportunists taking advantage of a situation which has been wrongly framed by the media.
[02:28:09.631 --> 02:28:10.971]  And it was about to happen again.
[02:28:11.511 --> 02:28:19.334]  We've already had a wave in recent weeks and months of mass burglaries, thefts, mass looting in central London.
[02:28:19.654 --> 02:28:22.195]  The media barely even reports on it.
[02:28:22.575 --> 02:28:26.896]  The only way you find out about it is via viral videos on Twitter and YouTube.
[02:28:27.674 --> 02:28:40.718]  Of groups, mobs of urban youth, as they call them, smashing into candy stores, smashing into off-licences 7-Elevens, stealing sweets, stealing alcohol.
[02:28:41.158 --> 02:28:44.039]  This has been building over the summer months.
[02:28:44.319 --> 02:28:53.002]  The police chiefs got together and put out a report and basically said there's going to be widespread looting in urban areas if you don't give them a massive handout.
[02:28:53.022 --> 02:28:54.403]  They're already giving them £400 later this month.
[02:28:56.050 --> 02:28:59.236]  And then they're going to give them basically pay half their energy bills.
[02:28:59.877 --> 02:29:05.206]  That was one of the major reasons why the new Prime Minister went along with this and we've got a video talking about it now.
[02:29:05.466 --> 02:29:07.570]  A strange time in the UK.
[02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:08.071]  Here it is.
[02:29:08.646 --> 02:29:11.767]  Well, it's a strange time to be living in the UK right now.
[02:29:11.847 --> 02:29:14.268]  Today we have a new Prime Minister.
[02:29:14.408 --> 02:29:15.548]  Yes, another one.
[02:29:15.608 --> 02:29:27.011]  Who, to deal with the cost of living crisis caused by her government trying to desperately prolong a war 1,500 miles away, is set to authorise a massive benefits bonanza for the general public.
[02:29:27.051 --> 02:29:33.393]  Today we learn that the primary reason for the handout is to prevent people committing crimes and rioting in the streets.
[02:29:33.573 --> 02:29:42.336]  One MP briefed by local police said if the new Prime Minister doesn't dole out enough free cash it would quote push more people towards crime and lead to public unrest.
[02:29:42.437 --> 02:29:45.178]  Other police chiefs warn that crime is already on the rise.
[02:29:45.278 --> 02:29:52.981]   Shops are routinely being ransacked with scenes like this in Norwood, South London becoming commonplace yet Barely making the news.
[02:29:53.081 --> 02:29:57.682]  A woman was also violently attacked by the same mob during the same incident.
[02:29:57.702 --> 02:30:02.684]  Police have already said they don't have the resources to respond to or investigate theft and burglary.
[02:30:02.724 --> 02:30:09.646]  Presumably because many of their officers are elsewhere performing more important duties, like doing the Macarena at Gay Pride Parade.
[02:30:11.732 --> 02:30:18.395]  Of course, no one even asks where the 100 billion plus pound benefits handout is even coming from.
[02:30:18.435 --> 02:30:23.257]  Presumably, as ever, from the magic money tree called crippling future taxes.
[02:30:23.317 --> 02:30:33.844]   Yes, the people who work hard and actually earn money will foot the bill to ensure that urban youth Don't get upset and start smashing up JD Sports and Sports Direct shops.
[02:30:33.944 --> 02:30:41.952]  Now I'm not saying that legitimately desperate people won't need to steal food this winter in order to get by without any support.
[02:30:41.972 --> 02:30:49.259]  But there's a big difference between that and mass looting the nearest footlocker so you can get your hands on the latest pair of Air Jordans, isn't there?
[02:30:49.299 --> 02:31:04.706]   When that happens, What happened during the 2011 riots, which took place mainly in London and in other ethnically diverse cities, much of the media framed such mindless theft as a justified protest or the legitimate re-appropriation of wealth.
[02:31:04.726 --> 02:31:18.071]  In reality, it was Britain's feral underclass exercising their warped sense of self-entitlement to engage in rampant criminal opportunism, knowing the metropolitan elite and its propaganda organs would give them a free pass.
[02:31:18.371 --> 02:31:22.033]  Expect a similar response to any mass public disorder later this year.
[02:31:22.073 --> 02:31:35.341]  Meanwhile, the country's paper of record, the London Times, can barely contain its glee at the fact that there will be no white men in major cabinet positions in the new government for the first time in British history.
[02:31:35.381 --> 02:31:40.804]  But hey, I guess it's just another example of institutionalised racism and white male privilege.
[02:31:44.076 --> 02:32:02.989]   I'm going to come back on the other side and talk about the situation in Europe because whereas in the UK we've had a government handout, promised government handouts basically that are going to pay two-thirds of people's energy bills, In Germany, in the Czech Republic and in other European countries, they haven't had such a bailout as of yet.
[02:32:03.409 --> 02:32:09.413]  There's now mass protests on the streets that are being ignored by the media in the Czech Republic.
[02:32:10.373 --> 02:32:17.278]  Swiss government is saying that they will imprison people for turning their heating up above 19 degrees Celsius in Switzerland.
[02:32:18.129 --> 02:32:20.531]  It's really coming down to the YS Summit.
[02:32:20.611 --> 02:32:21.591]  Dot News, we'll be back.
[02:32:22.032 --> 02:32:44.968]  Well, back during the Covid lockdowns of 2020 and early 2021, we pointed out that this was a dry run, a test run for climate lockdowns, that they would enforce punitive measures against people emitting carbon dioxide or using energy in the event of a, quote, climate emergence, even though, of course, we know the whole climate change hysteria is precisely that.
[02:32:45.859 --> 02:32:48.022]  It was actually happening in some countries.
[02:32:48.082 --> 02:32:50.766]  It was happening in India in 2020.
[02:32:50.826 --> 02:33:01.880]  The government would literally come out and announce, pollution's too high, we have a climate emergency, no cars in certain cities or in certain areas of cities on this day in India.
[02:33:02.581 --> 02:33:09.286]  Simultaneously, the much-vaunted fact-checkers came out and said, there's no such thing as climate lockdowns.
[02:33:09.346 --> 02:33:10.446]  They don't exist.
[02:33:10.967 --> 02:33:12.648]  No one's even talking about them.
[02:33:13.048 --> 02:33:22.274]  Of course, you had the WEF and all these other globalist technocrat groups celebrating how quiet it was during the lockdown and how nature was flourishing.
[02:33:22.876 --> 02:33:24.556]  At the expense of humanity, of course.
[02:33:25.157 --> 02:33:26.477]  Climate lockdown's happening.
[02:33:26.977 --> 02:33:33.438]  Fact-checkers simultaneously claiming that anyone who said that was a dangerous conspiracy theorist and needed to be banned and censored.
[02:33:33.978 --> 02:33:36.039]  Well, what is happening now?
[02:33:36.599 --> 02:33:38.299]  We have energy emergencies.
[02:33:38.339 --> 02:33:43.340]  We have punitive measures being enforced against citizens for using energy.
[02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:45.061]  I had this story last week.
[02:33:46.061 --> 02:33:50.622]  Power company seizes control of thermostats in Colorado during heatwave.
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:58.365]  22,000 households in Colorado lost the ability to control their thermostats after the power company seized control of them during a heatwave.
[02:33:58.806 --> 02:34:14.117]  Saw the same thing in California yesterday, of course, where they're asking people, at the moment it's asking, next it's going to be telling, not to use energy until, what was it, 9pm at night or something like that, to avert an energy crisis.
[02:34:14.137 --> 02:34:17.200]  They're going to roll the energy crisis into the climate crisis.
[02:34:17.820 --> 02:34:33.934]  In Colorado, what appears to have happened was that these people signed up for a rewards program where if they allowed outside forces to control their thermostat, or at least give them recommendations on what to do with their thermostat, that they would get some money off their bills.
[02:34:34.495 --> 02:34:57.153]   What they didn't realize at the time, of course, was that The power company could literally hijack their thermostat and flash up an emergency warning and prevent them from turning on the AC, which is exactly what happened to 22,000 households in Colorado because of smart meters, which we were warning you about, what, 15 years ago?
[02:34:57.593 --> 02:34:58.874]  Now we see it happening.
[02:34:59.434 --> 02:35:02.456]  Meanwhile, EU demands mandatory energy rationing.
[02:35:03.357 --> 02:35:10.049]   European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen Has asked EU member nations to implement mandatory.
[02:35:10.409 --> 02:35:11.290]  Mandatory.
[02:35:11.370 --> 02:35:11.950]  Remember that?
[02:35:12.551 --> 02:35:23.137]  In Spain, they have bans on AC being below 27 degrees Celsius, which is pretty darn hot in summer, and being above 19 degrees Celsius in winter.
[02:35:23.657 --> 02:35:26.439]  Fines of up to €600,000.
[02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:34.644]  In other words, if you're a business that puts your heating on in winter against the government mandate, your business is finished.
[02:35:34.984 --> 02:35:36.585]  They have inspectors going round.
[02:35:36.985 --> 02:35:50.331]  We now have the European Commission President saying they're going to have mandatory energy rationing to flatten the curve, using the exact same language that the totalitarian technocrats used to lock us down.
[02:35:50.632 --> 02:35:58.655]  We now know that lockdown was a complete scam from beginning to end, yet they're still deploying the same weaponised language.
[02:35:59.156 --> 02:35:59.796]  Switzerland.
[02:35:59.936 --> 02:36:04.018]  Swiss face up to three years in prison for violating heating rules.
[02:36:05.433 --> 02:36:10.446]  People in Switzerland have violated the country's new heating rules which forbid setting the temperature above 19 degrees.
[02:36:11.127 --> 02:36:11.929]  Bear in mind...
[02:36:13.263 --> 02:36:15.864]  Old people who are especially susceptible to the cold.
[02:36:16.224 --> 02:36:19.444]  Again, we were supposed to lock down the entire society.
[02:36:19.885 --> 02:36:23.465]  Take five booster shots to protect the elderly.
[02:36:23.865 --> 02:36:29.627]  Oh, but when it gets to winter, they're going to literally kill them off by having the heating below 19 degrees.
[02:36:30.167 --> 02:36:35.188]  That may seem okay for most people, but if you're elderly, you need to stay warm.
[02:36:36.539 --> 02:36:39.980]  We had an entire lockdown based around protecting vulnerable people.
[02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:46.122]  As soon as it gets to the winter, oh Sodom, let's get that heating down because we've got an energy crisis.
[02:36:46.763 --> 02:37:01.788]  Under the new rules, buildings that use gas heating systems are restricted to 19 degrees Celsius, that is 66.2 Fahrenheit for you Americans, while hot water can only be heated up to 60 degrees Celsius and radiant heaters are banned entirely.
[02:37:02.361 --> 02:37:09.872]  They may fine you $30, they may fine you $3,000, or they may put you in prison for three years.
[02:37:10.553 --> 02:37:14.720]  Good news, though, is that we've now got mass protests on the streets against this.
[02:37:15.453 --> 02:37:38.460]  Not against Vladimir Putin, but against the actual sanctions on Russia, against the lie that this is solely Vladimir Putin's fault when we had the inflation beforehand, when we had the disastrous net zero agenda, climate change hysteria, crap that has made all these European countries overly dependent on green energy, overly dependent on Russian energy.
[02:37:39.409 --> 02:37:50.412]  To the point where, up until a couple of weeks ago, the German government was planning to shut down all its nuclear plants across the entire country, despite this massive cost-of-living crisis.
[02:37:50.452 --> 02:37:53.392]  They only reversed that decision at the last minute.
[02:37:54.393 --> 02:37:56.573]  This is called revolt against the current thing.
[02:37:56.613 --> 02:38:00.134]  This is about the protest in Prague that happened this past weekend.
[02:38:00.174 --> 02:38:00.714]  Let's roll it.
[02:38:02.005 --> 02:38:06.468]  There were gigantic protests in the Czech capital of Prague over the weekend.
[02:38:06.548 --> 02:38:12.112]  An estimated 70,000 people marched out of a population of 10.7 million.
[02:38:11.951 --> 02:38:16.351]   That's the equivalent of over half a million people marching in Germany.
[02:38:16.351 --> 02:38:21.951]  [Music]
[02:38:21.951 --> 02:38:22.951]  What were their demands?
[02:38:23.059 --> 02:38:32.206]  An end to energy sanctions on Russia, neutrality regarding the conflict in Ukraine, an end to weapons supplies in Ukraine and the resignation of their government.
[02:38:32.246 --> 02:38:36.869]  This was the first major revolt against the current thing crisis.
[02:38:37.009 --> 02:38:42.614]  Some of the demonstrators carried banners saying aid for Ukrainians and two sweaters for us.
[02:38:42.654 --> 02:38:48.078]  The crowd also chanted demise and we've had enough in reference to their desire for the government to resign from power.
[02:38:48.118 --> 02:38:54.984]  People prepared slogans against the EU, NATO, Prime Minister Peter Fiala, the Green Deal for Europe and the government's rejection of Russia.
[02:38:54.823 --> 02:39:01.383]   This is not our war, the crowd asserted, angry at soaring inflation and spiralling energy bills.
[02:39:01.383 --> 02:39:10.582]   And you can't dismiss the Czechs as being unwitting agents of Putin.
[02:39:10.855 --> 02:39:15.737]  They suffered under the brutal occupation of Soviet forces right up until the end of the 80s.
[02:39:15.877 --> 02:39:20.560]  Similar protests are also being planned in major German cities over the course of the next month.
[02:39:20.620 --> 02:39:31.145]  It remains to be seen what the response of the authorities will be, given that protesters have already been demonised as domestic extremists and warned that they're being watched by the security services.
[02:39:34.457 --> 02:39:58.068]  That indeed is happening in Germany, where of course we've had numerous top public officials come out over the last few weeks and say, these protesters who are planning to demonstrate against cost of energy increases, massive spikes in bills, they're domestic extremists, they're just continuing from the anti-vaxxer stuff, we need to have literal secret services watch them, people struggling to pay their bills.
[02:39:59.235 --> 02:40:01.561]  In the UK we've had a better outcome of course.
[02:40:01.621 --> 02:40:04.268]  I talked about it earlier with the new Prime Minister Liz Truss.
[02:40:04.308 --> 02:40:07.155]  The one thing she has done, the one good thing she has done...
[02:40:07.955 --> 02:40:17.746]  Apart from this bailout, which we'll end up paying for anyway, is she's restarted fracking in the UK, which there should have never been a moratorium on fracking in the first place.
[02:40:18.266 --> 02:40:23.032]  It was an energy miracle for the United States, and it was initially for the United Kingdom.
[02:40:23.352 --> 02:40:37.965]   This cost of energy crisis, in terms of shortages of gas, energy rationing and so forth, would have never have happened If we'd have kept that fracking running, well now she's finally reintroduced it, at least lifted the ban on it, so hopefully that will come to pass.
[02:40:38.866 --> 02:40:41.388]  Economists, Europeans, are mad with anger and it will worsen.
[02:40:41.408 --> 02:40:55.839]  That is French economist Charles Gave saying that Europeans now recognise that it isn't all Vladimir Putin's fault, that it's their own leaders' over-dependent stupidity of pursuing net-zero policies that has led us down this path.
[02:40:56.759 --> 02:41:01.280]   And also, We just played the video there of the mass protests in Prague.
[02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:03.802]  This was censored by the media.
[02:41:03.882 --> 02:41:06.024]  Obviously there were some news reports about it.
[02:41:06.564 --> 02:41:16.313]  Getty Images did not send a single photographer to the mass demonstration in Prague involving 70,000 people.
[02:41:16.653 --> 02:41:19.415]  Bear in mind that's a country with a population of only about 10 million.
[02:41:19.736 --> 02:41:22.758]  If that was in Germany, as I said in the video, it'd be half a million people.
[02:41:23.219 --> 02:41:27.302]   You go on Getty Images News, Type in Prague protest.
[02:41:27.822 --> 02:41:39.473]  The last thing they have on there, bear in mind they're supposed to cover world events entirely, is a protest, never again, a pro-Ukraine protest from May 2022, from four months ago.
[02:41:39.853 --> 02:41:50.562]  Not a single Getty Images news photographer was sent to a giant mass protest in the capital city of the Czech Republic on Saturday to document that.
[02:41:50.623 --> 02:41:51.183]  It's cover up.
[02:41:51.243 --> 02:41:51.704]  We'll be back.
[02:41:51.744 --> 02:41:52.124]  Now go away.
[02:41:53.010 --> 02:42:09.959]  Now I still have some housework to do in terms of covering remaining UK issues because we had a new Prime Minister and we also had a media celebrating the fact that there was no white man in a major government role in this new Conservative government.
[02:42:10.519 --> 02:42:12.881]  Like being white or male was a bad thing.
[02:42:13.101 --> 02:42:13.581]  It's not.
[02:42:14.001 --> 02:42:38.216]   And we're going to get into that, but first I want to play the first few minutes from this new video that went up a few hours ago, because we've had some major damaging revelations about OnlyFans and the damage it's doing to both men and women over the course of the past few days, as it's revealed that their profits run to, in terms of the owner of OnlyFans, this shadowy pornographer, Half a billion dollars in profit.
[02:42:38.256 --> 02:42:40.398]  This is called Simpocalypse.
[02:42:40.878 --> 02:42:41.458]  Here's the clip.
[02:42:43.340 --> 02:42:49.143]  Remember in early 2020 when I made that simps video?
[02:42:49.183 --> 02:42:50.604]  What on earth is a simp?
[02:42:50.664 --> 02:42:54.707]  Trying to urge young men against pursuing such a vacuous destructive habit.
[02:42:54.747 --> 02:42:57.109]  Yeah, took a big fat L on that one, didn't I?
[02:42:57.129 --> 02:42:59.911]  For the simps are now legion and they are many.
[02:42:59.971 --> 02:43:01.572]  Welcome to the Simpocalypse!
[02:43:03.593 --> 02:43:17.224]  OnlyFans majority owner Leonid Radvinsky, a shadowy pornographer about whom virtually nothing is known and the media barely tries to find out, made $500 million from OnlyFans in the space of just 18 months.
[02:43:17.324 --> 02:43:20.747]  The company's profits have soared from $61 million in 2020 to $433 million last year.
[02:43:24.910 --> 02:43:33.134]  Their user base has metastasized to 220 million, most of them men, with 2021 seeing a 128% increase.
[02:43:33.174 --> 02:43:39.337]  Get this, simps spent 4.8 billion dollars on OnlyFans last year alone.
[02:43:39.398 --> 02:43:45.401]  Lockdown handed them an army of new users, and now the cost of living crisis will hand them an army of new creators.
[02:43:45.260 --> 02:43:50.700]   Whenever society catches a metaphorical disease, OnlyFans is the first parasite on the scene.
[02:43:50.700 --> 02:43:53.500]  Quick as a flash to make it all immeasurably worse.
[02:43:53.500 --> 02:44:03.420]  Andrew Tate gets vilified and banned for supposed "misogyny".
[02:44:03.598 --> 02:44:06.579]  He's apparently this massive, dangerous threat to young men.
[02:44:06.639 --> 02:44:12.841]  Yet we've lost, completely lost, an entire generation of young men to simpery and OnlyFans.
[02:44:12.901 --> 02:44:19.723]  Tate's the devil incarnate for offering courses teaching young men how not to be dysfunctional, emotionally crippled losers.
[02:44:19.763 --> 02:44:26.225]  Yet courses teaching young women how to be OnlyFans camgirls, rapaciously feeding off the corpse of masculinity.
[02:44:26.466 --> 02:44:27.846]  Oh, that's just fine!
[02:44:28.046 --> 02:44:32.869]  Whether you're just starting out at OnlyFans or in the process of creating one, this program is for you.
[02:44:33.049 --> 02:44:36.651]  I give you all the secret tips and tricks other creators don't want you to know.
[02:44:36.671 --> 02:44:42.474]  Yeah, OnlyFans might literally be shrinking young men's brains, but Andrew Tate said something offensive!
[02:44:42.614 --> 02:44:52.300]  OnlyFans founder Radvinsky ran websites in the 90s and 2000s providing hacked passwords to porn sites, featuring underage performers and bestiality.
[02:44:52.360 --> 02:44:55.702]  Countless under-18s are selling explicit videos on OnlyFans.
[02:44:55.742 --> 02:45:01.385]  There are children as young as 14 years of age that are then seeing the opportunity to generate income.
[02:45:01.445 --> 02:45:06.888]  Children are getting OnlyFans user accounts approved after using their grandmother's passport.
[02:45:06.989 --> 02:45:11.491]  Police say one 14-year-old used her grandmother's passport to sell explicit images.
[02:45:11.571 --> 02:45:14.313]  Nonsense are then trying to meet up with them in real life.
[02:45:14.977 --> 02:45:19.379]  These are the types of comments she received while promoting her OnlyFans account on Twitter.
[02:45:19.639 --> 02:45:22.360]  Some request more graphic content and ask she'll meet up.
[02:45:22.380 --> 02:45:26.621]  Missing children are even appearing in explicit OnlyFans videos.
[02:45:26.681 --> 02:45:32.923]  Childline says children have anonymously contacted their counseling service and talked about their experiences on the site.
[02:45:33.704 --> 02:45:37.605]  Some reported separately being victims of historic sexual abuse.
[02:45:37.765 --> 02:45:43.147]  We saw a dozen or so children that were also linked with content on OnlyFans.
[02:45:43.387 --> 02:45:47.588]  It's becoming increasingly clear that OnlyFans is being used by children.
[02:45:48.448 --> 02:45:51.909]  Children on occasions are being blackmailed and exploited.
[02:45:52.289 --> 02:46:02.412]  The company are not doing enough to put in place the safeguards that prevent children exploiting the opportunity to generate money, but also for children to be exploited.
[02:46:02.532 --> 02:46:05.133]  All of this gets a pass from the dominant culture.
[02:46:05.493 --> 02:46:06.733]  No action is taken.
[02:46:07.133 --> 02:46:07.894]  No one cares.
[02:46:07.934 --> 02:46:10.375]  Yeah, it's Andrew Tate who's the real problem.
[02:46:10.415 --> 02:46:12.096]  Yeah, he's the one who must be stopped.
[02:46:12.216 --> 02:46:15.899]  But OnlyFans changed their colours to the Ukrainian flag!
[02:46:15.939 --> 02:46:19.561]  They posted the black square in solidarity with Black Lives Matter.
[02:46:19.621 --> 02:46:23.644]  I mean, yeah, they may be facilitating the trafficking and sexual abuse of children.
[02:46:23.684 --> 02:46:27.466]  They may be utterly destroying normal, healthy human relationships.
[02:46:27.506 --> 02:46:29.888]  That's where your five billion beta bucks went.
[02:46:29.928 --> 02:46:33.430]  But isn't it more important that they support the message?
[02:46:33.590 --> 02:46:35.872]  Andrew Tate didn't put a Ukraine flag in his bio.
[02:46:39.201 --> 02:46:39.761]  There you have it.
[02:46:39.942 --> 02:46:45.805]  You can watch the rest of that video on YouTube, but I want to move into this topic, and we've got another final video to play on this.
[02:46:46.586 --> 02:46:54.351]  Because again, we've had a new Prime Minister in the UK, and she has chosen a government cabinet that contains no white men.
[02:46:55.172 --> 02:46:57.753]  The newspapers, the media heralded this.
[02:46:57.813 --> 02:46:58.654]  They commended it.
[02:46:59.338 --> 02:47:05.062]  Headline, Times newspaper highlights how no white men will hold major office in new UK government.
[02:47:05.442 --> 02:47:11.726]  The Times newspaper in the UK has published an article noting how no white men will hold major office in the new government led by Liz Truss.
[02:47:12.346 --> 02:47:15.388]  No grey offices of state will contain white men.
[02:47:15.408 --> 02:47:23.996]   And again, can you imagine the new government of Nigeria Which recently banned diversity in advertising, by the way.
[02:47:24.057 --> 02:47:24.837]  Very interesting.
[02:47:25.317 --> 02:47:44.029]  Imagine the new government in Nigeria containing no black men in any of their major government offices, and then the media in Nigeria celebrating that as a great example of progressivism, despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of the population in Nigeria is of course black, just as still.
[02:47:44.629 --> 02:47:49.233]  The majority of the population, around 86%, is white in the United Kingdom.
[02:47:49.273 --> 02:47:52.656]  This video is called No Country for White Men.
[02:47:52.716 --> 02:47:53.336]  Let's roll it.
[02:47:53.697 --> 02:47:58.941]  For the first time in British history, no great office of state will be held by a white man.
[02:47:58.981 --> 02:48:04.205]  Liz Truss's new Conservative government contains no white man in a prominent cabinet position.
[02:48:04.245 --> 02:48:04.505]  Ha!
[02:48:04.626 --> 02:48:05.566]  Take that, leftists!
[02:48:05.706 --> 02:48:07.248]  Who are the real racists now?
[02:48:09.093 --> 02:48:15.255]  Following on from The Times, The Telegraph became the latest newspaper to commend this as a boon for diversity.
[02:48:15.315 --> 02:48:19.296]  Diversity that's not quite diverse enough to include white men.
[02:48:19.416 --> 02:48:24.357]  In Britain, where the population is 87% white, you're not that kind of diversity.
[02:48:24.417 --> 02:48:29.098]  Liz Truss forms most diverse cabinet in history with no white males in top jobs.
[02:48:29.138 --> 02:48:34.578]   She appointed her key ally, Kwasi Kwarteng, who has gone A in heritage, to the treasury, James Cleverley, whose mother is from
[02:48:34.578 --> 02:48:39.529]   Sierra Leone, was made foreign secretary, and Suella Braverman, whose parents are of Indian origin,
[02:48:39.529 --> 02:48:44.087]   became home secretary. Meanwhile, this is the woman who has been picked to become health
[02:48:44.087 --> 02:48:44.818]  secretary.
[02:48:44.818 --> 02:48:47.938]  Hmm. Now I'm not trying to be mean.
[02:48:48.191 --> 02:48:51.274]  Everyone at some point in their life has struggled with weight gain.
[02:48:51.314 --> 02:48:53.895]  But not everyone gets to become the Health Secretary.
[02:48:53.935 --> 02:48:55.557]  It seems to be a common theme.
[02:48:55.637 --> 02:48:59.480]  Belgium previously appointed a 20 stone woman as Health Minister.
[02:48:59.540 --> 02:49:05.684]  Maybe the next Chancellor of the Exchequer will be someone with a history of bankrupted businesses and petty theft convictions.
[02:49:06.024 --> 02:49:06.605]  Or maybe not.
[02:49:06.665 --> 02:49:12.309]   To her credit, Therese Coffey, who is Catholic and anti-abortion, good for her, Addressed her critics.
[02:49:12.349 --> 02:49:16.150]  She acknowledged that she's not a role model for health, but will do her best in the job anyway.
[02:49:16.170 --> 02:49:17.070]  I mean, good luck to her.
[02:49:17.090 --> 02:49:20.592]  She can't be any worse than arch lockdown zealot Matt Hancock, can she?
[02:49:20.632 --> 02:49:23.833]  But will Liz Truss be any better than Boris Johnson?
[02:49:24.373 --> 02:49:26.334]  The early signs aren't great.
[02:49:26.394 --> 02:49:31.116]  The first thing she did upon becoming Prime Minister was to pledge a loyalty oath to the current thing.
[02:49:32.256 --> 02:49:34.657]  Prolonging a war 1,500 miles away.
[02:49:34.737 --> 02:49:41.519]  And how did Liz Truss address the very real crisis of record numbers of boat migrants arriving in England on a daily basis?
[02:49:41.599 --> 02:49:48.501]  A massive security threat, a huge drain on economic resources, a total insult to the very notion of borders and nationhood.
[02:49:48.561 --> 02:49:51.061]  Well, she didn't even mention it.
[02:49:51.421 --> 02:49:53.622]  No, not a single word.
[02:49:56.172 --> 02:50:08.078]  And in further fallout from the announcement of this new diverse cabinet, Remix News reports ex-BBC presenter issues grovelling apology after calling new Conservative administration the Coconut Cabinet.
[02:50:08.138 --> 02:50:09.759]  This is a left-wing anti-racist.
[02:50:10.299 --> 02:50:21.404]  The former BBC TV and radio presenter has apologised for and withdrawn a controversial remark about Liz Truss's new government, referring to what is the most diverse administration in British history as the Coconut Cabinet.
[02:50:22.024 --> 02:50:36.926]   Now what was interesting about his grovelling apology on Twitter Was that in apologising for calling it a coconut cabinet, and again, you know, these people in this cabinet may be far better than the white men in the previous Boris Johnson cabinet.
[02:50:36.966 --> 02:50:37.806]  That's not the point.
[02:50:38.187 --> 02:50:42.030]  The point is, why is the media celebrating the fact there's no white people in it?
[02:50:42.091 --> 02:50:42.811]  That's weird.
[02:50:43.152 --> 02:50:44.052]  That's effed up.
[02:50:44.533 --> 02:50:57.639]   But then this Ian McWhirter, this former BBC journalist, Apologized for making an, what he said, was an ironic reference to a term used by some on the left about black people who are deemed traitors to the cause through joining the Tory party.
[02:50:58.080 --> 02:51:00.841]  And again, it's that whole narrative bigotry of low expectations.
[02:51:01.522 --> 02:51:05.264]  They expect people's skin color to be wedded to their political opinions.
[02:51:05.305 --> 02:51:09.808]  They think black people are all stupid and should all think the same things, but they're the anti-racists.
[02:51:10.588 --> 02:51:14.645]   But in making this groveling apology, he said, quote, Indeed!
[02:51:15.245 --> 02:51:22.007]  I tweeted earlier that the Trust's Cabinet made the Scottish Government look, quote, hideously white.
[02:51:22.548 --> 02:51:37.032]  I have always championed racial diversity in my columns, so in making his apology for being racist, he proudly showcased his previous tweet in saying that another Cabinet in Scotland was, quote, hideously white.
[02:51:38.354 --> 02:51:41.557]  What other race does he think is hideous or is it just white people?
[02:51:42.018 --> 02:51:50.487]  And how on any sane planet is that a right anti-racist apology for him making a racist statement?
[02:51:50.527 --> 02:51:52.629]  That's going to wrap it up for the Summit News Hour.
[02:51:52.969 --> 02:51:54.311]  Coming up next is the War Room.
[02:51:54.130 --> 02:52:01.130]  don't go away, stay tuned.
[02:52:01.130 --> 02:52:16.489]  Now I got called last night by Tony Lyons at Skyhorse.
[02:52:16.525 --> 02:52:19.868]  He said we have a very good chance of sending The Great Reset on Amazon to number one.
[02:52:19.888 --> 02:52:22.189]  And if that happens, it'll make the book 20 times bigger.
[02:52:22.269 --> 02:52:22.870]  It's a great book.
[02:52:22.990 --> 02:52:24.651]  It's the blueprint of the New World Order and how to stop them.
[02:52:24.691 --> 02:52:25.712]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:52:25.932 --> 02:52:27.834]  And that would be a major funding boon for us.
[02:52:27.874 --> 02:52:29.275]  So it's like hitting the lottery.
[02:52:29.415 --> 02:52:32.857]  If it goes to number one, no matter what they do, it just magnifies.
[02:52:32.977 --> 02:52:34.258]  It's been as high as number six.
[02:52:34.399 --> 02:52:35.579]  It's number nine today.
[02:52:35.700 --> 02:52:39.342]  It's number one in more than 50 charts in the United States and the world right now.
[02:52:39.362 --> 02:52:40.803]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:52:41.544 --> 02:52:43.826]  Kindle, everything, the book is now shipping as well.
[02:52:43.866 --> 02:52:45.727]  But I want you to get it at Amazon.com.
[02:52:45.787 --> 02:52:47.588]  I want you to buy copies for friends and family.
[02:52:47.668 --> 02:52:51.511]  We can send it to number one today and now is the time to do it.
[02:52:51.571 --> 02:52:54.113]  And you got to go look at the reviews that are pouring in.
[02:52:54.213 --> 02:52:55.954]  Currently today, it was number nine earlier.
[02:52:55.974 --> 02:52:57.195]  It's number 16 right now.
[02:52:58.856 --> 02:53:04.199]  But you look at it where it's number one in bestsellers and political corruption and misconduct.
[02:53:04.680 --> 02:53:06.281]  And the Kindle's number three.
[02:53:08.584 --> 02:53:10.604]  That's beating free books being put out by Obama.
[02:53:10.925 --> 02:53:13.805]  Best sellers in globalization, number one and number three.
[02:53:16.326 --> 02:53:19.627]  Best sellers in United States history, number one.
[02:53:19.767 --> 02:53:20.807]  Kindle, number six.
[02:53:21.027 --> 02:53:21.787]  And it goes on and on.
[02:53:22.007 --> 02:53:25.048]  You gotta go read the reviews.
[02:53:25.688 --> 02:53:27.168]  Number one in history.
[02:53:28.249 --> 02:53:28.949]  Think they like that?
[02:53:29.569 --> 02:53:30.969]  That's a major message to them.
[02:53:33.810 --> 02:53:34.510]  Number one.
[02:53:36.010 --> 02:53:37.591]  In bestsellers in media studies.
[02:53:37.971 --> 02:53:38.752]  Think they like that?
[02:53:40.393 --> 02:53:42.595]  Bestsellers in corruption and misconduct.
[02:53:42.895 --> 02:53:43.395]  Number one.
[02:53:44.576 --> 02:53:46.057]  Bestsellers in world history.
[02:53:46.117 --> 02:53:46.637]  Number one.
[02:53:47.298 --> 02:53:48.318]  And read the reviews.
[02:53:48.659 --> 02:53:50.220]  People are blown away.
[02:53:50.580 --> 02:53:52.501]  Five stars out the rear end.
[02:53:53.662 --> 02:53:55.343]  Thank you everybody for what you're doing.
[02:53:55.363 --> 02:53:56.244]  We're in this fight together.
[02:53:56.424 --> 02:54:00.046]  And this is a message that humanity wants the blueprint of the Death Star.
[02:54:00.467 --> 02:54:02.268]  Humanity wants to take on the New World Order.
[02:54:03.559 --> 02:54:06.360]  Alex Jones is right about far more than he's wrong about.
[02:54:06.660 --> 02:54:08.840]  He's the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[02:54:08.900 --> 02:54:09.460]  Joe Rogan.
[02:54:10.840 --> 02:54:13.541]  And the quotes from Steve Bannon, Tucker Carlson, and others.
[02:54:14.821 --> 02:54:20.482]  If Alex Jones is just a crackpot, why are the most powerful people in the country trying to silence him?
[02:54:21.623 --> 02:54:24.403]  No one bothers to censor the Flat Earthers.
[02:54:24.463 --> 02:54:25.683]  Maybe Alex Jones is onto something.
[02:54:26.003 --> 02:54:28.184]  Read this book and decide for yourself who's crazy.
[02:54:29.329 --> 02:54:31.131]  Get it today at Amazon.com.
[02:54:31.211 --> 02:54:32.251]  Drive it to number one.
[02:54:32.332 --> 02:54:39.197]  If all of you just simply go there and get your Christmas shopping out of the way and buy 5, 10 of these books, we'll get $3 or $4 a piece.
[02:54:39.297 --> 02:54:40.418]  That'll help keep us on air.
[02:54:40.699 --> 02:54:41.920]  And that's what you get as the author.
[02:54:42.020 --> 02:54:43.861]  You get a lot more, buy them at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:54:43.881 --> 02:54:45.943]  But I don't want you to get it at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[02:54:46.183 --> 02:54:50.006]  I want you to get it at Amazon.com to send that sucker to number one.
[02:54:50.026 --> 02:54:52.048]  And you have the power to do it right now.
[02:54:52.188 --> 02:54:53.029]  Go to Amazon.com.
[02:54:53.049 --> 02:54:56.372]  We'll put a big link in the live show feed, right under the live show video.
[02:54:56.912 --> 02:54:57.352]  Big Link.
[02:54:57.372 --> 02:55:03.698]  In fact, we'll put a whole big story up at the very top that's saying, send The Great Reset and The War of the World to number one with a link to Amazon.
[02:55:03.798 --> 02:55:04.778]  Let's do it now.
[02:55:05.039 --> 02:55:06.139]  You won't fight the traffic.
[02:55:06.159 --> 02:55:07.300]  You won't battle all the crap.
[02:55:07.561 --> 02:55:09.302]  You won't deal with all the Christmas BS.
[02:55:09.342 --> 02:55:15.847]  You just buy 5, 10, 20 copies right now and send this sucker to number one.
[02:55:15.907 --> 02:55:16.728]  Turn it loose.
[02:55:16.988 --> 02:55:17.929]  It's an info war.
[02:55:18.149 --> 02:55:20.791]  This is an exercise of your will and your power.
[02:55:21.011 --> 02:55:22.312]  It's going to number one.
[02:55:22.333 --> 02:55:23.513]  I believe in you.
[02:55:23.774 --> 02:55:25.135]  Go there now and get it.
[02:55:28.277 --> 02:55:29.558]  Oh, no, no, I don't even know what this is!
[02:55:29.578 --> 02:55:30.218]  How did you get here?
[02:55:31.579 --> 02:55:33.660]  I just caught you, American!
[02:55:33.981 --> 02:55:36.062]  You visited Bandar Video!
[02:55:36.962 --> 02:55:40.164]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you!
[02:55:40.745 --> 02:55:46.308]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video, or I have to hurt you!
[02:55:46.688 --> 02:55:47.529]  Ah!
[02:55:49.390 --> 02:55:50.010]  Kung flu.
[02:55:50.071 --> 02:55:53.733]  It comes from China.
