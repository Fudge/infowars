[00:00.000 --> 00:27.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:27.000 --> 00:30.000]  It's time for humanity to stand up in the Infowar and say,
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[00:32.000 --> 00:38.000]  but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[00:38.000 --> 00:52.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:52.000 --> 01:02.000]  Recently, the central bank digital currencies have been the talking point at the global confabs
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.000]  because they lead to the creation of a global currency system.
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to the session on resetting digital currencies.
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.000]  The theme of this year's forum, as you know, is a crucial year to rebuild trust.
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.000]  The digital payment system can help reduce this logistical cost,
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.000]  can help remove the dangers of holding cash.
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.000]  As the architects of multiple global crises pour on the tyranny,
[01:33.000 --> 01:40.000]  the IMF is enjoying an elevated position as the problem solver most nations turn to for help,
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.000]  racketeering on a global scale.
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  With all the current issues on our agenda, we tend to forget.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  We are in the midst of the forced industrial revolution,
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.000]  which accelerates global change in much more comprehensive and faster ways
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  than the previous three revolutions.
[02:01.000 --> 02:07.000]  The objective is to quickly recognize the potential of new technologies.
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  History is truly at a turning point.
[02:11.000 --> 02:19.000]  We do not yet know the full extent and the systemic and structural changes which will happen.
[02:19.000 --> 02:29.000]  However, we do know that global energy systems, food systems and supply chains will be deeply affected.
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  And as Bloomberg gleefully reported, key Democratic congressional allies
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  are urging President Joe Biden's administration to support a new injection of resources
[02:39.000 --> 02:45.000]  for countries at the IMF to help them deal with the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  To the tune of at least 650 billion in additional IMF reserve assets,
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  the demand is being led by Representative Pramila Jayapal and Senator Elizabeth Warren.
[02:57.000 --> 03:02.000]  Zero hedge recently put the puzzle pieces together concerning the Democrats' proposed
[03:02.000 --> 03:09.000]  650 billion dollar flooding of the IMF with special drawing right funds.
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  What are special drawing right funds?
[03:12.000 --> 03:19.000]  The special drawing right, or SDR, was created by the IMF in 1969
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  to supplement the official reserves of its member countries.
[03:23.000 --> 03:29.000]  The SDR is an interest bearing international reserve asset that can only be held by the IMF,
[03:29.000 --> 03:35.000]  its member countries and designated official entities known as prescribed holders.
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  In addition to this role, the SDR serves as the unit of account of the IMF
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  and several other international organizations.
[03:43.000 --> 03:44.000]  Zero hedge writes,
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  Each new crisis brings global banks closer to their goal,
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  the introduction of national digital currencies and the SDR basket
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  become the de facto reserve trading tool for the world.
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.000]  Why do Democrats specifically want aid denominated in SDRs?
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  Because funding allocations in the US have already hit their maximum
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  and new funding bills are being defeated in the Senate.
[04:11.000 --> 04:14.000]  At the IMF, there are no checks and balances.
[04:14.000 --> 04:21.000]  They can ask for almost any amount of money in the form of SDRs without oversight.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  There are always strings attached when it comes to the IMF and in exchange for SDRs,
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  the globalists will certainly want more centralized control.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.000]  The Ukrainian war is not merely a money laundering operation.
[04:35.000 --> 04:41.000]  It is a linchpin to transfer the global economy out of the money printing of central banks
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  and directly into the hands of globalists controlling the IMF.
[04:45.000 --> 04:52.000]  We are being looted in real time of our property currency sovereignty and our very lives.
[04:52.000 --> 05:16.000]  John Bown reporting.
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.000]  We have come so far together. Please help keep us on the air.
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  We're under massive attack right now, but we're going to win with your help.
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  We're going to overcome this with your help and with God's blessing.
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  Please go to infoworkstore.com and get this book.
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.000]  Many, many, many years of research have gone into this.
[05:40.000 --> 05:45.000]  The Great Reset and the War for the World available right now at infoworkstore.com.
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  There's also signed copies available as well.
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.000]  We've got a lot of other big projects we're working on that are about to start launching as well,
[05:52.000 --> 05:56.000]  but this is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book
[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000]  because it warns the world of the globalist plan.
[05:58.000 --> 06:22.000]  Get the Great Reset at infoworkstore.com.
[06:45.000 --> 06:50.000]  It's Friday, July 29th.
[06:50.000 --> 06:54.000]  The year is 2022.
[06:54.000 --> 07:00.000]  And we really hit a nerve with the establishment yesterday.
[07:00.000 --> 07:07.000]  Scores of New World Order mouthpieces lashed out and said,
[07:07.000 --> 07:14.000]  Alex Jones claims he's Jesus Christ, which couldn't be further from the truth.
[07:14.000 --> 07:18.000]  I'm a lot closer to the devil than I am to Jesus in my flesh,
[07:18.000 --> 07:22.000]  but my spirit, I want to be Christ like and I follow Christ.
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  But what nerve did I hit?
[07:24.000 --> 07:31.000]  When I really started pushing 20 years ago about endocrine disruptors in the food and water,
[07:31.000 --> 07:37.000]  sterilizing and feminizing men and hyperfeminizing women and causing cancer and accelerated aging,
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  they flipped out very early on.
[07:40.000 --> 07:43.000]  Then, of course, in the last decade, they've obsessed over it.
[07:43.000 --> 07:44.000]  Of course, it's all true.
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  Now it's the top story everywhere and they just say it's irreversible.
[07:47.000 --> 07:48.000]  Almost everybody's infertile.
[07:48.000 --> 07:52.000]  The life expectancy is dropping, get used to it.
[07:52.000 --> 08:01.000]  Well, yesterday I talked about human dominion and human supremacy over the earth.
[08:01.000 --> 08:09.000]  Because the globalists want to build their AI transhumanist supremacy.
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.000]  And I said the world's really divided into two camps.
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.000]  Those that believe in human supremacy is given to us by God and Genesis.
[08:16.000 --> 08:27.000]  And if you don't believe in that, even if you don't believe in that,
[08:27.000 --> 08:35.000]  you're just going to let other humans claim that they have supremacy over you and make you a slave.
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.000]  That's why the founders, even though some of them didn't believe in God, most of them did,
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.000]  said we're going to say we're endowed by our Creator with certain rights,
[08:43.000 --> 08:46.000]  so that there's not a king above that.
[08:46.000 --> 08:53.000]  By putting God on top and we're made the image of God, we put ourselves on top.
[08:53.000 --> 08:59.000]  So this whole movement is anti-human and that's what Satan is,
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  whether you believe Satan's a real thing or an archetype.
[09:02.000 --> 09:10.000]  These are manifestations of how humans behave and the different choices that we have in our world.
[09:10.000 --> 09:18.000]  So at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to try to do a very calm version of the rant I did for 10 minutes.
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  You can see it in FullWars.com.
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.000]  Alex Jones, the human supremacist legendary speech is what the crew called it.
[09:25.000 --> 09:32.000]  And I think it really is a legendary speech because it lays down the two choices we have.
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  We're made the image of God. We have divine potential.
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.000]  We can do incredible things. We're building a better world.
[09:38.000 --> 09:42.000]  We're going to go interplanetary, intergalactic, interdimensional,
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.000]  or we're just programmable blobs of flesh ruled by our overlords
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.000]  that tell us we don't have free will even though we do.
[09:50.000 --> 09:54.000]  So there were a lot of articles and I was sitting right before I went live.
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.000]  I almost got late on air because I was in my office reading
[09:58.000 --> 10:02.000]  and I meant to run in and tell the crew just to type in Alex Jones.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  Without even looking this morning, I saw dozens of the articles.
[10:04.000 --> 10:11.000]  Alex Jones compares himself to Jesus and Alex Jones goes completely crazy on air
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  and talks about human supremacy.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  But I didn't compare myself to Jesus.
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  I said that Christ said we'll be persecuted as He was if we follow Him.
[10:19.000 --> 10:26.000]  But then on the other side of that is transcendence, just basic Christian ethos.
[10:26.000 --> 10:33.000]  So I'm going to lay this out as I said at the bottom of the hour.
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.000]  Maybe you folks in there will print me a few of those articles.
[10:35.000 --> 10:38.000]  There's so many. I forgot to send them to you
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  because it really illustrates how panicked they are
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  that we're pointing out what their cult is
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.000]  and what its ongoing plans for all of us are.
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  And I've got some real illustrations that tie into all of this
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.000]  that we're going to be laying out as well here today on this live broadcast.
[10:58.000 --> 11:03.000]  But here's just one example of what I'm talking about.
[11:03.000 --> 11:09.000]  CBS News and I've got one out of New Scientist.
[11:09.000 --> 11:17.000]  Scientists have created reanimated necrobots that were formerly spiders
[11:17.000 --> 11:22.000]  that can lift 100 times their weight
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  and are being programmed to go out and carry out missions.
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  Now, imagine if I was just reading a research paper
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  which I read years ago about these developments and I did talk about it.
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  They'd say, Jones is insane. He says they're creating zombie spiders.
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  And I'm sure today when I do a whole breakdown of it,
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.000]  the establishment will clip it out, edit out where I show this is being done,
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.000]  the video, the articles, and they'll just say he's insane.
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.000]  He says they're creating zombie robot spiders.
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  And then why would they do that? Why would they out of one side of their mouth
[11:57.000 --> 12:04.000]  admit they're doing it but on the other side attack yours truly?
[12:04.000 --> 12:11.000]  And the answer is they want to precondition you that it's a joke as they roll it out against you.
[12:11.000 --> 12:18.000]  Ha ha ha, Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel and all of them said in the last decade,
[12:18.000 --> 12:24.000]  Jones is crazy. He thinks they're putting chemicals in the water that turn the frogs gay.
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  Even though that's exactly what they're doing.
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.000]  They don't really turn them gay. It feminizes them and sterilizes them.
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  So that's just one article, neck robot.
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  That means dead creatures that are now robots.
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  That's not a Star Trek episode where we are the Borg.
[12:44.000 --> 12:50.000]  You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.
[12:50.000 --> 12:55.000]  This is 2022 robot spiders.
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.000]  And again, I told you this not to act impressive because it wasn't that impressive.
[13:00.000 --> 13:07.000]  It was an industrial level operation in the early 1980s where pioneering oral surgeons
[13:07.000 --> 13:15.000]  and dentists like my father who were the first doing dental implants were approached
[13:15.000 --> 13:22.000]  to go work at site R in Maryland underground where they would work several months underground
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  and then a month out, several months underground, a month out.
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  And I sat there around the corner when my parents stayed late at the dinner table
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.000]  and I learned that when I got done eating they'd sit at the dinner table sometimes for an hour
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.000]  drinking coffee or tea and talk about things and I'm many times sat around the corner
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  listening to things I shouldn't have listened to.
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  And I since talked about that about it years later and he said it wasn't a big deal.
[13:45.000 --> 13:55.000]  They got approached by the CIA and my dad as a Baylor medical school professor
[13:55.000 --> 14:01.000]  had done work for the CIA but only because they had chosen that facility
[14:01.000 --> 14:06.000]  to have CIA officials have their dental work done because they'd have like armed people
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  in the room when they were doing the dental work.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  So they knew my dad, he'd done a lot of dental work on the deputy director and people like that
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  and we had some family that had been the CIA so that's probably why they chose him to be their dentist.
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  But he was trying to convince my mom because he wanted to do it.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  And plus it was like $400,000, $500,000 a year.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  Back then that'd be like $3-4 million a year.
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  He said, I want to go do it.
[14:24.000 --> 14:25.000]  It's exciting.
[14:25.000 --> 14:26.000]  He says, well, what is it?
[14:26.000 --> 14:27.000]  He goes, well, I can't tell you Carol.
[14:27.000 --> 14:28.000]  You know, it's classified.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  They haven't told me everything but it's cybernetics.
[14:30.000 --> 14:31.000]  It's cyborgs.
[14:31.000 --> 14:38.000]  He goes, I'd imagine, you know, they kind of let me know they were going to be implanting volunteer soldiers
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  and spies with things.
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  Since I'm good at implanting things in bone, they told me.
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.000]  And he said, first we'll be practicing on animals.
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.000]  But there's a large project and he said, you know, they've already recruited doctors
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  such and such and such and such and such.
[14:54.000 --> 15:00.000]  So in like 1982 or three after the exact year, maybe it was about 84,
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000]  I'm around the corner listening to a 20-minute conversation about underground bases and cyborgs
[15:05.000 --> 15:13.000]  and how they were already recruiting dozens of Dallas oral surgeons to be part of the project
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  and that they wanted basically my dad to lead part of it in some expansion.
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  And that's all they told him.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  But see, you tell stories like that, it sounds crazy, but now it's all out in the open.
[15:23.000 --> 15:29.000]  You know, if you think they were implanting soldiers with secret technology in 1984
[15:29.000 --> 15:36.000]  at underground bases in Maryland, folks, what do you think they're doing now?
[15:36.000 --> 15:42.000]  What do you think they're doing now?
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  We're not in the year 2022.
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  We're like in the year 2050, technologically.
[15:46.000 --> 15:52.000]  And they're about to roll out this whole separate civilization, this breakaway civilization against us.
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  And that's what everything's really about.
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.000]  This civilization, as you know, it's gone.
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.000]  The globalist great reset or the war for the world is here,
[16:03.000 --> 16:09.000]  but humanity is not being caught flat-footed because of info wars and because of your support.
[16:09.000 --> 16:15.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever as we reach the critical heart of the battle
[16:15.000 --> 16:21.000]  that you spread the word and that you support liberty and that you warn people like you've never done before.
[16:21.000 --> 16:23.000]  We have come so far together.

[17:59.000 --> 18:03.000]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family,
[18:03.000 --> 18:07.000]  to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate our marriages
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  and the studies are all clear.
[18:09.000 --> 18:15.000]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there's problems in the bedroom
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  and the number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this
[18:22.000 --> 18:25.000]  because they don't want people having lasting, good, loving relationships.

[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  Folks, this is a joke.
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  I mean, we're giving this thing away at 75% off.
[19:44.000 --> 19:47.000]  By the way, it works for me in case you haven't noticed.
[19:47.000 --> 19:51.000]  The hair and beard formula is working for me.
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  Quite well, I might add.
[19:53.000 --> 19:57.000]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[19:57.000 --> 20:22.000]  I go and see him quite often now.
[20:50.000 --> 20:53.000]  But we chose to let our problems multiply.
[20:53.000 --> 21:00.000]  Because we're faithfully pursuing a policy of truth.
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.000]  And that's why they spend all their time trying to say we're wrong.
[21:04.000 --> 21:05.000]  We lie.
[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  They try to pick a few things we didn't get exactly right.
[21:08.000 --> 21:09.000]  Are we questioned?
[21:09.000 --> 21:10.000]  So we're the devil.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  Because they want the power to silence your speech
[21:13.000 --> 21:17.000]  and what you're allowed to read, watch or listen to.
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.000]  They're trying to control our reality.
[21:20.000 --> 21:23.000]  All right, let me just hit what's coming up today.
[21:23.000 --> 21:26.000]  Because it's just an incredible time to be alive.
[21:26.000 --> 21:31.000]  Big Tech is censoring even mainline economists
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  that say we're officially in a recession,
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.000]  even though we're officially in a recession.
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  Think of the level of that gaslighting.
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  Got a big stack on that.
[21:41.000 --> 21:47.000]  Have incredible announcements on the COVID front with them announcing,
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  I told you what happened, I told you this three years ago
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.000]  or 32 months ago, over two and a half years ago,
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.000]  is they have a similar virus that attacks chickens
[21:56.000 --> 22:03.000]  and other foul, other poultry.
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  And once they keep giving the chickens or the ducks
[22:08.000 --> 22:13.000]  or the turkeys these shots,
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  because they stopped working,
[22:15.000 --> 22:18.000]  they then give them this super shot
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  that totally changes their entire physiology
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.000]  and they basically become these bloated mutants full of tumors.
[22:25.000 --> 22:31.000]  There's a particular name for the vaccine induced disorder in poultry.
[22:31.000 --> 22:33.000]  There's actually several big disorders.
[22:33.000 --> 22:38.000]  Well, I told you if you take five or six of the first mutant and genic shots,
[22:38.000 --> 22:41.000]  then they have a super shot that mutates you
[22:41.000 --> 22:44.000]  and makes all your joints basically double in size.
[22:44.000 --> 22:48.000]  And sure enough, they've announced a super shot
[22:48.000 --> 22:52.000]  that will fix everything because the other shot didn't work
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  and erased your immune system.
[22:54.000 --> 22:58.000]  By-administration Unveil reformulated booster shot.
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.000]  Australia is calling it a super shot.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  This one shot will now suddenly work.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  The first four or five didn't.
[23:05.000 --> 23:09.000]  By-administration Unveil reformulated booster shot.
[23:09.000 --> 23:16.000]  We've got a bunch of compilations of Fauci and Bricks flip-flopping.
[23:16.000 --> 23:22.000]  Anthony Fauci is still funding China's military-run labs with U.S. taxpayer money
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.000]  while the by-administration accuses China of creating the virus.
[23:25.000 --> 23:28.000]  So you got censored for two and a half years for saying that,
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.000]  but now Biden's openly accusing China.
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  They're accusing the U.S. military.
[23:34.000 --> 23:37.000]  It is man-made, but then we're still told,
[23:37.000 --> 23:40.000]  but for you, you can't say, oh, you were right.
[23:40.000 --> 23:41.000]  You were vindicated.
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  No, no, no, you're still censored.
[23:43.000 --> 23:46.000]  As a general public, if you point that out.
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  Rand Paul is up on m4s.com.
[23:48.000 --> 23:51.000]  He's congratulated Biden for achieving real immunity
[23:51.000 --> 23:54.000]  after he's already had COVID three times in four shots.
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  But if he hadn't taken the shots,
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  he would have already gotten real immunity.
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.000]  Meanwhile, Tour de France cyclists who quit race,
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.000]  just as many people are suffering from breathing problems
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.000]  because they've been vaccinated and heart attacks.
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.000]  That's just a small smattering of the news.
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.000]  I kind of just got into that.
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  But look at all the dehumanization news.
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  We're going to hit the ties in to whether we're going to have
[24:18.000 --> 24:26.000]  globalist AI supremacy or God-given genesis supremacy.
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  German cities turn off hot water,
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  cut lighting at government buildings.
[24:30.000 --> 24:34.000]  This is real bands use of cash, cash is banned.
[24:34.000 --> 24:37.000]  You will own nothing and be happy PSAs being announced everywhere,
[24:37.000 --> 24:39.000]  including the school children that you won't own a house,
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  a car, anything, a new systems here.
[24:41.000 --> 24:44.000]  We're in a beautiful transition, you know, the collapse.
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.000]  World Economic Forum calls for an end of personal vehicle ownership.
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  And now, I told you this was coming 20 years ago,
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  because I can see where they were headed.
[24:54.000 --> 25:00.000]  And I tell you, it's now moving to make you wear a helmet to walk.
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  They've already started saying no helmet, no running.
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  But now they're saying they're going to start fitting children
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  with helmets that oh, because it might save a life,
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.000]  also have VR goggles that are AI that the system can hit a button
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.000]  and make the children go under VR control.
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  It's been announced.
[25:21.000 --> 25:24.000]  It's been announced with VR helmets by law.
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  So that's the next phase of that.
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.000]  This is all happening, it's all rolling out, it's all being done
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.000]  to suck you out of reality and force you finally into the matrix,
[25:33.000 --> 25:39.000]  which is the final goal, a total 3D immersion matrix
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.000]  to try to trick you into giving up your soul to these people.
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  All joggers must wear a helmet.
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  No helmet, no run.
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.000]  First they lock you down for a couple years with the COVID hysteria
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.000]  so it's really to save the earth and you got to wear helmets everywhere you go.
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  Oh, and now we're going to make the children at public schools
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  and elsewhere wear VR goggles at school
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.000]  and then oh, you got to wear them all the time for your safety.
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.000]  So I told you years ago they're going to make you wear a helmet
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.000]  to leave your house, you laugh, but now here it is.
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  We've got that information.
[26:13.000 --> 26:17.000]  Mother loses custody of daughter for refusing transgender status
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  saying she's a girl right here in America.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  That all ties together.
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  We have so much to get into on the military front
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  that nobody's giving any coverage to now.
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.000]  In Ukraine and China's heating up big time, China's army chief says
[26:33.000 --> 26:39.000]  get ready for war over US visit to Taiwan.
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.000]  That ties into Nancy Pelosi's visit and so much more
[26:43.000 --> 26:48.000]  and Trump is really starting to get hardcore.
[26:48.000 --> 26:51.000]  On one side he's exposing pedophile rings
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  and the Democratic Party are a bunch of pedophiles
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  calling him sickos, pushing sexual content to kindergartners.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  He's come out and said nobody's gotten to the bottom of 9-11.
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.000]  He said there were bombs in the building two days after it happened.
[27:03.000 --> 27:09.000]  He's a smart guy, but similarly though he's done a lot of other really good things
[27:09.000 --> 27:14.000]  like exposing the open border and bad trade deals,
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  but he's still pushing that poison shot.
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  Even when Birx, his own top advisor says we knew it wouldn't work,
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  but we told Trump it would.
[27:22.000 --> 27:25.000]  She admits we knew it wouldn't work, but we told him it would
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  and so he listened to his science advisors.
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  He got 20 doctors in the room and you're somebody like Trump,
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.000]  you know, 77 years old or whatever he is,
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  especially old timers believe doctors.
[27:35.000 --> 27:38.000]  So I mean I'll give him a pass on being conned,
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  but I'm not going to give Trump a pass.
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  He doesn't start coming out against us now.
[27:42.000 --> 27:45.000]  He's just saying I was conned, I was manipulated, they lied
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  because it's coming out that the shots don't help you
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  in a racial immune system and really hurt you.
[27:50.000 --> 27:56.000]  So this is a real deal killer for me.
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.000]  If Trump doesn't do what Bolsonaro did,
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.000]  he didn't support the shots, he just allowed it.
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  He says I apologize, they should have been outlawed,
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.000]  they were experimental, they've hurt and maimed and killed
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  a lot of people, I apologize, I was lied to.
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.000]  Yes, that's the manly thing to do, that's leadership.
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  Admit he was conned, not one-tenth as bad as Trump,
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.000]  and come out and deal with it and then start saving people.
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  Because if you were lied to and you're wrong, it's okay
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.000]  to change course, but then once you learn you're wrong,
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.000]  once you learn you got conned, now you become a party to it.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  Now you're aiding and abetting it.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  That's why when we're wrong folks, we're the first to say it.
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  Alex Schultz is not always right, we try to be right,
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  we have one of the best records of being right,
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  and we're major trailblazers, and have broken
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  tens of thousands of incredible stories.
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  But we are wrong sometimes, and when we aren't,
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  we admit to it because that's all we've got is our credibility,
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  not in front of the public, but in front of God.
[28:55.000 --> 29:05.000]  That's my audience one.
[29:27.000 --> 29:29.000]  We're going to win with your help.

[32:20.000 --> 32:23.000]  metabolic system and your metabolism

[32:56.000 --> 33:22.000]  It's worked great for me.
[33:34.000 --> 33:37.000]  You know, I'm going to get into human supremacy
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  and what that really means next segment.
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  It's the longest segment of the hour.
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  I'm going to hit some other news dealing with the gaslighting
[33:43.000 --> 33:47.000]  and the great reset collapse of the human supporting infrastructure
[33:47.000 --> 33:51.000]  on this planet first and how that ties together
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.000]  with the master plan for the next segment.
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.000]  But first off, let me just say something here.
[33:58.000 --> 34:03.000]  I've had friends and family and people on the street
[34:03.000 --> 34:08.000]  really support us during all this kangaroo court
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  persecution that's going on.
[34:11.000 --> 34:18.000]  And I have had the staff at the courthouse
[34:18.000 --> 34:22.000]  tell me almost all of them I walk by and talk to.
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  We appreciate you. We understand what's happening.
[34:24.000 --> 34:27.000]  This is wrong. We're ashamed.
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.000]  They fist bump us in my crew.
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.000]  When I go to the little cafe next door during a break,
[34:34.000 --> 34:42.000]  they give us free food and waitresses kiss us on the cheeks
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.000]  and say, hey, that New York Times reporter came over
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.000]  and asked me if you were drinking alcohol.
[34:47.000 --> 34:48.000]  I told you you weren't.
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.000]  I mean, it's like Fight Club where it's on.
[34:51.000 --> 34:54.000]  I'm at the grocery store yesterday, shake 20 hands,
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  probably walk by 50 people.
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.000]  They all said we're so sorry for what's happening.
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  It's wrong. Keep fighting. How do you take it?
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.000]  I had crew members like a bunch of them coming to my office
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  this morning and hug me.
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  I had Owen come in here and hug me and say a lot of people
[35:11.000 --> 35:12.000]  were praying for us.
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  And I looked at Owen right before I went on the air today.
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  And I said, Owen, we knew this was coming.
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  This is a sign of our success.
[35:21.000 --> 35:27.000]  What's happening to us is nothing in the big picture.
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.000]  You understand they're giving millions of six-month-old babies
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  and up an experimental deadly shot.
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  We know destroys their immune system for life
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  and causes cardiovascular problems and sterilization.
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  And I have stacks of news admitting it today, major studies.
[35:41.000 --> 35:45.000]  What I have nightmares about, what stresses me
[35:45.000 --> 35:49.000]  on what grays my hair is knowing I've got four children
[35:49.000 --> 35:53.000]  in this world and I have responsibility to fight them.
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  The global is trying to shut us down.
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  The global is trying to put me in prison
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  with the January 6th committee.
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.000]  The global is trying to put me on the street.
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  That means nothing.
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.000]  I mean, you understand how much I would love to drive a tractor
[36:10.000 --> 36:15.000]  and shred and bale hay and feed cows and ride horses
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.000]  and live in a trailer.
[36:18.000 --> 36:22.000]  You know how relaxing it is in a single-wide little trailer
[36:22.000 --> 36:25.000]  with your family up on a hill overlooking beautiful oak trees
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  and pine trees.
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  You know how good it is to climb up on the back of your horse
[36:29.000 --> 36:32.000]  and ride out and check the cattle and check the fences
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.000]  where your ancestors have done it for 200 years.
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.000]  That's my pain is not being on the ranch.
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  My pain is not being with my family
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  and fishing and hiking and hunting.
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  My pain is seeing innocent people hurt.
[36:48.000 --> 36:51.000]  My pain is seeing our beautiful world destroyed
[36:51.000 --> 36:56.000]  and taken over by the biochemical, alchemical scientists
[36:56.000 --> 36:57.000]  in the New World Order.
[36:57.000 --> 37:02.000]  And seeing our fellow humans who've fallen to this demonic evil
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.000]  snickering and laughing at us like gremlins because we dare try to save them
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  and save ourselves in the process.
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.000]  So if the New World Order thinks it's getting to me
[37:12.000 --> 37:16.000]  with all these fake lawsuits and rigged courts, they are.
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  In that it distracts me from the work we're doing here on air
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.000]  and the world-changing things we've done together.
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  You're not an audience.
[37:25.000 --> 37:29.000]  You are the energy and you are the arms and legs and guts and blood
[37:29.000 --> 37:32.000]  and bone and mind and eyes and intellect and spirit and soul
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  and will of the pro-human resistance.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  So I am in anguish.
[37:38.000 --> 37:39.000]  I am in torture.
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  I am in pain.
[37:41.000 --> 37:42.000]  I am upset.
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  I am having nightmares over the destruction of our species,
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  not over the fact that I am trying to fight these people
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  and they know if they just kill me outright
[37:52.000 --> 37:55.000]  or put me in prison outright, that would turn me into a bigger martyr.
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  So they think setting me against dead kids
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  in a rigged trial of lies where we can't even defend ourselves
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  and where the judge already says we're guilty,
[38:02.000 --> 38:07.000]  they think that's the only way they can then demonize the archetypal
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.000]  resistor, the archetypal populist who's fighting them.
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.000]  But the result is the vast majority of people
[38:15.000 --> 38:18.000]  have absolutely seen through it.
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.000]  So the Democrats and their lawyers and their controlled corrupt judges
[38:21.000 --> 38:25.000]  can sit there and pretend in their little rotting bubbles
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.000]  of the collapsing dinosaur media and the collapsing judiciary
[38:29.000 --> 38:33.000]  and the collapsing economy that they're beating me
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.000]  when I have already made the decision to do this mission,
[38:37.000 --> 38:41.000]  whether I get killed, put in prison, tortured, made homeless,
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.000]  that means nothing to me.
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.000]  People that love football or basketball or baseball like I did growing up,
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  I would get so upset when my team lost.
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000]  I would get so upset when things like that.
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  Finally, as I learned about the world and history,
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.000]  I was like, I'm a fool to care about this.
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.000]  Not that it's bad to watch sports, but it's bad to make it your top thing.
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.000]  And so when I see unborn children being killed
[39:05.000 --> 39:08.000]  and six-month-old babies being given experimental shots
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  and five-year-olds being tricked by public schools that they're really a girl
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.000]  and signing up when they're tend to have their testicles chopped off
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  and their penises cut off,
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  I take that personally because I have empathy
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.000]  because I know it's happening to all of us. I'm connected to everyone.
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.000]  So the new world order wants to hurt me, you have.
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.000]  And I can see that the horrible things that have been done to me
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.000]  that I haven't even talked about on air, horrible, horrible things.
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  I'm not a victim. I asked for this. I got in the arena.
[39:37.000 --> 39:43.000]  Are hundreds of times worse than taking every dime I've got away?
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.000]  Now, I don't want to be totally destroyed and not be able to keep our operation going.
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  I want to keep our great crew employed
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  and we're doing such great work.
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  But whatever happens, it's in God's plan.
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.000]  But I want people to really get their priorities straight right now
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  and ask yourselves, what are your priorities?
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  Because there is a corporate world government, anti-human, transhumanist
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  AI takeover happening of the planet right now
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  that sees all of us as obsolete
[40:11.000 --> 40:16.000]  and says that their plan is to get rid of 90% of us at least.
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.000]  So to me, that's front and center.
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.000]  If aliens were attacking and blowing up our major cities,
[40:22.000 --> 40:28.000]  would I care if I lost money in the stock market?
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  And the answer is no.
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  That's the same thing.
[40:31.000 --> 40:37.000]  So the people in the system are what I call suicide bankers.
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  And that happened on 9-11.
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  We've talked about it a lot. It's on record it happened.
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  Hundreds of men and women, mainly men, stayed in the towers
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  as they burned smoking because there was such a panic going on
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.000]  making millions of dollars, in some cases, a minute individually.
[40:52.000 --> 40:56.000]  Some people, one guy made $45 million while he stayed in the tower
[40:56.000 --> 40:57.000]  for 30 minutes before it collapsed.
[40:57.000 --> 41:02.000]  And his wife got the money, but he died.
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.000]  Well, I'm not one of these lawyers or bankers or FBI people
[41:06.000 --> 41:14.000]  or media people that go along with all of this
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  feeling like they're on a winning team.
[41:16.000 --> 41:19.000]  You're not on a winning team serving the enemy.
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.000]  I know M4Ware's greatest work is now in hand,
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  but I can't continue to do it without your support.

[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  They attack us in court over, he sells supplements.
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  Yeah, so does Whole Foods.
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  So does every other major grocery store because they work.
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.000]  But the point is, is that they're mad that we set up our own economy.
[41:48.000 --> 41:51.000]  They're so threatened by independent media that's pro-human
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  having its own infrastructure.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  So please continue to support that infrastructure

[42:25.000 --> 42:26.000]  It sells out.
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  They'll book it every day and then it'll spread from there.
[42:28.000 --> 42:29.000]  All of this is activism.

[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  Look at the hair and beard support formula.
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  Folks, this is a joke.
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  We're giving this thing away. It's 75% off.
[45:45.000 --> 45:48.000]  By the way, it works for me in case you haven't noticed.
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.000]  The hair and beard formula is working for me.
[45:51.000 --> 45:54.000]  Quite well, I might add.
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  Well, my barber appreciates
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  hair and beard support for men.

[47:00.000 --> 47:03.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[47:03.000 --> 47:12.000]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:12.000 --> 47:29.000]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time,
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.000]  run on for a long time, sooner or later
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  gotta cut you down, sooner or later
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.000]  gotta cut you down.
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.000]  Go tell that long-tongued liar
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.000]  Go and tell that midnight writer
[47:45.000 --> 47:48.000]  Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.000]  Tell him that God's gonna cut him down
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.000]  Tell him that God's gonna cut him down
[47:54.000 --> 48:01.000]  Alright, yesterday I did a impromptu rant
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  about how I'm a human supremacist.
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  Now I believe in humanity.
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  Now I love everyone of every race, color, and creed
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  where one race made by God
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.000]  part of a larger plan that God has.
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  And I read out of Genesis
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  where God says we've been given dominion over the earth.
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  And if you don't decide you have dominion
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  someone else is gonna decide you're an animal
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  and they have dominion over you
[48:23.000 --> 48:24.000]  and that's what the globalists say.
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  You don't have free will, you're an animal,
[48:26.000 --> 48:27.000]  but they know that's not true.
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  They want you to subserve your will
[48:29.000 --> 48:32.000]  and subserve your destiny to them.
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  There are some of the headlines.
[48:34.000 --> 48:35.000]  It's all over the place.
[48:35.000 --> 48:40.000]  Alex Jones likes himself to Jesus in wild dystopian rant.
[48:40.000 --> 48:45.000]  Same type of article headlines everywhere.
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  This had nothing to do with quarter any of it.
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.000]  M4 Wars host Beggs judged to drop riot charges.
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  I don't have any riot charges.
[48:53.000 --> 48:54.000]  It's a daily beast.
[48:54.000 --> 48:55.000]  It's totally made up.
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  I'm like Jesus.
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  What?
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.000]  Go see the actual speech for yourself on m4wars.com.
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  Alex Jones, the human supremacist legendary speech.
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  Here's what I actually said.
[49:10.000 --> 49:16.000]  And then that ties in to this whole transhumanist world
[49:16.000 --> 49:17.000]  that's being established.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  But the reason I went into this yesterday
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  and I'm gonna explain more details of it right now
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  is because there is an organized design collapse
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  of the infrastructure the globalists admit
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  to force you onto their new system.
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  They claim will be more sustainable and better,
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  but it's not even a new system.
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  It is extermination.
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  This is a big deal.
[49:38.000 --> 49:39.000]  This is the biggest deal.
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  This is the new world order.
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  This is their takeover plan.
[49:42.000 --> 49:45.000]  This is everything we've warned about.
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.000]  Now writ large.
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.000]  Now unfolding.
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  And what prompted me to talk about this
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.000]  was a tweet a few days ago about Elon Musk.
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  He said a new philosophy of the future is needed.
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  I believe it should be curiosity
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  about the universe.
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.000]  Expanded humanity to become a multi-planet,
[50:07.000 --> 50:10.000]  an interstellar species to see what's out there.
[50:10.000 --> 50:17.000]  Yes, I totally agree with that statement.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  He said this is compatible with existing religions.
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  Surely God would want us to see creation.
[50:22.000 --> 50:23.000]  Yes, exactly.
[50:23.000 --> 50:29.000]  God built this for us to experience God's creation together
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.000]  and the wonderment and the worship of the interface
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.000]  of seeing a pool of fish or dolphins
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  or birds in the sky or a sunset
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  or your baby playing on the ground with blocks
[50:40.000 --> 50:44.000]  or just all the incredible things that life gives us
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.000]  that are so fulfilling that we're designed to love
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  and designed to commune with
[50:49.000 --> 50:55.000]  and designed to be a part of in this continuum.
[50:55.000 --> 50:59.000]  And if you read Genesis, whether you believe in God or not
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  or believe this is divinely inspired,
[51:01.000 --> 51:06.000]  it's beautiful and it is the truth.
[51:06.000 --> 51:09.000]  It's absolutely important to understand
[51:09.000 --> 51:15.000]  as we read Genesis 26, 27 and 28.
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  And God said, let us make man in our image
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  in their image.
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  It says it right here, folks.
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  And God, the preachers don't want you to know
[51:26.000 --> 51:27.000]  what this is being said here.
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  And God said, let us make man in our image
[51:30.000 --> 51:34.000]  after our likeness and let them have dominion
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  over the fish of the sea, over the fowl of the air
[51:36.000 --> 51:39.000]  and over the cattle and over all the earth.
[51:39.000 --> 51:40.000]  What are they taking away?
[51:40.000 --> 51:41.000]  Our dominion over all of it.
[51:41.000 --> 51:45.000]  And over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
[51:45.000 --> 51:46.000]  27.
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  So God created man in his own image
[51:48.000 --> 51:53.000]  and the image of God created him.
[51:53.000 --> 51:58.000]  Male and female created them.
[51:58.000 --> 51:59.000]  28.
[51:59.000 --> 52:02.000]  And God blessed them, his backing, his support, his commission.
[52:02.000 --> 52:06.000]  And God said to them, be fruitful and multiply
[52:06.000 --> 52:09.000]  and replenish the earth and subdue it.
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.000]  What's Elon Musk doing?
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  About like 10 children.
[52:12.000 --> 52:16.000]  And have dominion over the fish of the sea
[52:16.000 --> 52:17.000]  and over the fowl of the air,
[52:17.000 --> 52:23.000]  over everything that moveeth upon the earth.
[52:23.000 --> 52:29.000]  And God said, behold, I have given you every herb,
[52:29.000 --> 52:33.000]  bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth.
[52:33.000 --> 52:34.000]  Gave it to us.
[52:34.000 --> 52:35.000]  Incredible technology.
[52:35.000 --> 52:41.000]  And every tree in which is the fruit of a tree-yielding seed.
[52:41.000 --> 52:46.000]  If you, it shall be for meat.
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  And it goes on from there.
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.000]  Verse 30.
[52:51.000 --> 52:52.000]  And to every beast of the earth,
[52:52.000 --> 52:53.000]  and to every fowl of the air,
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  and to everything that creepeth upon the earth,
[52:55.000 --> 52:56.000]  wherein there is life,
[52:56.000 --> 53:00.000]  I have given every green herb for meat.
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  And it was so.
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  The plants create the meat.
[53:04.000 --> 53:05.000]  Feed the meat.
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.000]  And God saw everything that he had made.
[53:08.000 --> 53:12.000]  And behold, it was very good.
[53:12.000 --> 53:19.000]  And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
[53:19.000 --> 53:22.000]  And the seventh day is to rest and contemplate
[53:22.000 --> 53:25.000]  this cathedral, this beautiful spaceship
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  that God made for us.
[53:27.000 --> 53:31.000]  That is our launch pad, our springboard,
[53:31.000 --> 53:36.000]  our portal into the wider universe and beyond.
[53:36.000 --> 53:40.000]  Infinity and beyond, Buzz Lightyear says.
[53:40.000 --> 53:43.000]  And then when you study everything the New World Order does,
[53:43.000 --> 53:46.000]  it is in countervention.
[53:46.000 --> 53:49.000]  It is 100% countervailing.
[53:49.000 --> 53:52.000]  Everything that's wholesome and good,
[53:52.000 --> 53:55.000]  that works, that regenerates, that is beautiful,
[53:55.000 --> 54:00.000]  and that is in communion with the Creator.
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  We were made to worship.
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  That doesn't mean like a slave on your knees.
[54:04.000 --> 54:07.000]  We were made to interface.
[54:07.000 --> 54:13.000]  God, the groom, humanity, the bride,
[54:13.000 --> 54:17.000]  babies, given the universe,
[54:17.000 --> 54:25.000]  given the little box of toys and blocks to play and build.
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  And there are those that know that,
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  who don't want us to become what we really are,
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  who want to end it and tell us we're bad
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  and tell us we're ugly and tell us,
[54:34.000 --> 54:39.000]  the human age is over, says Hurari of the WEF,
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  who gives his book away for free,
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  hoping it'd be number one in history,
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.000]  but the great reset by Alex Jones is number one,
[54:46.000 --> 54:52.000]  and will soon be number one total in the world.
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.000]  Because the people hunger for truth.
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.000]  And in the book,
[54:58.000 --> 55:02.000]  the great reset in the war for the world,
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  I lay out the entire history of this
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.000]  and the two different countervailing forces,
[55:08.000 --> 55:11.000]  those that want you to decide you have no free will,
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  those that want you to decide you're an animal,
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  those that want you to step down out of your position
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.000]  and let them rule over you and take the position of God.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  They tell you there's no God
[55:21.000 --> 55:28.000]  because they want to place themselves in that tabernacle,
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  in that holy of holies.
[55:32.000 --> 55:36.000]  They want to tell you you've got to go through them for an ascension
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.000]  and to transcend, you've got to give up your humanity
[55:40.000 --> 55:44.000]  and sign over your will and every action to them
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  and then they will fulfill you.
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  But all they do is destroy.
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  And Christ said,
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  you will know a tree by its fruits.
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  And you look at the fruits of the New World Order,
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  their death, their misery, their poverty, their disease,
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  they are poisoned.
[55:58.000 --> 56:02.000]  The gifts of God and the natural order is ascendance,
[56:02.000 --> 56:05.000]  completion.
[56:05.000 --> 56:10.000]  Beyond ecstasy, the feeling of total rest,
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.000]  total completion,
[56:13.000 --> 56:17.000]  absolute understanding, interfacing with God for eternity
[56:17.000 --> 56:21.000]  and watching the children pray.
[56:21.000 --> 56:28.000]  And one day we will
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  be there at the next level and the host of God
[56:32.000 --> 56:37.000]  and see the great plan from even a greater position of discernment.
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.000]  We will watch the children grow and watch the children pray.
[56:41.000 --> 56:45.000]  We will watch the children become what they choose to become
[56:45.000 --> 56:48.000]  and our great pain will be that our Father
[56:48.000 --> 56:51.000]  gave them the ability to live forever,
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  the ability to transcend,
[56:53.000 --> 56:56.000]  the ability to touch the divine
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  and instead they chose death.
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.000]  And that is always the great question of God.
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  Was it a crime to give you free will
[57:05.000 --> 57:08.000]  and allow some of you to fall, but we all know it wasn't
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  and that was God's decision and it was perfect
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  and we thank God for the gift of consciousness.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  We thank God for this great choice
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.000]  and we understand how absolutely perfect it is
[57:17.000 --> 57:22.000]  and we get on our knees with pleasure
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.000]  and ask God to take us to the next level.
[57:25.000 --> 57:28.000]  So all this trifling and petty garbage
[57:28.000 --> 57:33.000]  and systems of men working against God
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.000]  are nothing and have fallen.

[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  All right, big news next hour.
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  We're under massive attack right now
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  but we're going to win with your help.
[58:20.000 --> 58:22.000]  We're going to overcome this with your help

[58:23.000 --> 58:26.000]  Please go to infowarstore.com and get this book.
[58:26.000 --> 58:29.000]  Many, many, many years of research have gone into this.
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  The great reset and the war for the world
[58:31.000 --> 58:34.000]  available right now at infowarstore.com.
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.000]  There's also signed copies available as well.
[58:37.000 --> 58:39.000]  We've got a lot of other big projects we're working on
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  that are about to start launching as well
[58:41.000 --> 58:44.000]  but this is the cavalry because we need the funding
[58:44.000 --> 58:47.000]  and we need this book because it warns the world of the globalist plan.
[58:47.000 --> 58:50.000]  Get the great reset at infowarstore.com.
[58:50.000 --> 58:52.000]  We are now living in the void,
[58:52.000 --> 58:55.000]  sliding towards collapse in the strange space
[58:55.000 --> 58:58.000]  between what we've known and what's to come.
[58:58.000 --> 59:02.000]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is
[59:02.000 --> 59:06.000]  don't panic, stay calm because now is the time
[59:06.000 --> 59:09.000]  that we must get our bearings and steer the ship
[59:09.000 --> 59:11.000]  onto a safe sound course.
[59:11.000 --> 59:14.000]  There is nothing stopping we, the people,
[59:14.000 --> 59:18.000]  from making our own rules and building our own society.
[59:18.000 --> 59:21.000]  All we got to do is survive the crash
[59:21.000 --> 59:24.000]  and right now we still have time to prepare.
[59:24.000 --> 59:28.000]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[59:28.000 --> 59:31.000]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now
[59:31.000 --> 59:34.000]  including food, water and survival gear
[59:34.000 --> 59:37.000]  to keep us strong and at the ready.
[59:37.000 --> 59:41.000]  To preparetoday.com for the essentials,
[59:41.000 --> 59:45.000]  storable foods, water filtration, first aid, power
[59:45.000 --> 59:49.000]  and more at preparetoday.com
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  After being deleted by YouTube and social media in 2018,
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  most people did nothing to defend Alex Jones or InfoWars.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  Instead, they obediently learned the new rules
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  and rationalized their submission as a necessary evil.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  As a result, things have only gotten worse for everyone
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  and without any recourse, they are about to get much worse.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  Alex Jones is now patient zero for America's new
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  de facto justice system brought to you by the fear,
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  complacency and inaction of the people.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  Because we take it, here's how we can all expect to now be treated.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  Jones never mentioned their name and the parents never sought a retreat.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  Alex Jones is being sued for defamation and intentional
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  inflict of emotional distress by parents of children
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  who were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  The rest of the plaintiffs are federal agents
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  and the legal team is comprised of highly politicized
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  members of the anti-gun lobby who have admitted their intention
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  is to silence Alex Jones.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  So with this new precedent, if you dare question the official narrative
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  say for example, the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas,
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  then someone can sue you into oblivion for emotional distress.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  But it only gets worse.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  The plaintiffs claim that Alex Jones was the perpetrator
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  of the Sandy Hook Crisis Actor conspiracy theory,
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  which is demonstrably false.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  After all the censorship and deleted videos,
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  one can still find hours and hours of video content
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  compiled from hundreds of sources,
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  all questioning the official narrative of Sandy Hook.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  It was arguably the most discussed conspiracy theory since 9-11.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  And over the course of seven years,
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  Alex Jones spent less than 30 minutes discussing it.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  We know this because it's all part of the public record,
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  but these radical judges do not care about evidence.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  I am not currently representing Alex Jones,
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  so I am free to speak my mind.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  They're already apparently I've heard that the plaintiffs' lawyers
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  are complaining about me speaking out about the case.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  That's how corrupt these plaintiffs' lawyers are.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  They're political hacks standing on the bodies of dead kids
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  to line their pockets and take away other people's political rights.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  And I find it disgusting what they've done.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  And so, but in this particular context,
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  Jones has produced more discovery than anybody.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  I can't find anyone that produced more discovery than he is,
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  and yet they pretended that he didn't.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  Why?
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Because they built their whole case on a big lie.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  Both Judge Gamble in Texas and Judge Bellis in Connecticut
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  have found Alex Jones guilty without ever holding a trial
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  or hearing any evidence,
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  which is worse treatment than anyone has ever gotten in America,
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  including Charles Manson and Al Capone.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  And their excuse for this abomination of justice
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  is they claim that Jones failed to provide them
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  with the incriminating evidence that they imagined must exist.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  Whatever that mysterious, unspecified evidence is,
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  both judges have stripped Jones of his first amendment right,
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  but Judge Gamble has gone much further.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  Judge Maya Gamble comes from CPS,
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  who has been exposed for human trafficking
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  and working with pedophiles.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  Gamble helped publish CPS propaganda,
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  praising the state's authority,
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  and advising parents that it's normal for their children
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  to lie about being abused in foster care.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  In the Alex Jones case,
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  Judge Gamble has ordered that the words
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  First Amendment and free speech cannot be used by Alex Jones,
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  his witnesses, or even his lawyers.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  He is not allowed to defend himself.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  Judge Gamble has instructed that the jury is not allowed to hear
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  about the emotional trauma caused by the mass murderer
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  who killed the children.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  They are only allowed to hear how their trauma was caused
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  by the words of Alex Jones.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  And during jury selection, not a single juror thought
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  the media has ever treated Alex Jones or Infowars unfairly.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  And any juror who questioned the $100 million amount
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  casually discussed by the plaintiff's lawyers
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  were kicked off the jury.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  Alex Jones was canceled from social media in 2018,
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  and is now being canceled from the U.S. Bill of Rights
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  and Constitution.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  And because of our complacency, everyone else is next.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  In the case you were wondering, the way we used to do justice
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  was a thing called innocent until proven guilty.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  It relied upon the burden of proof, and it was pretty good.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  The globalist great reset, or the war for the world, is here.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  We have come so far together, please help keep us on the air.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  We're under massive attack right now,
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  but we're going to win with your help.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  We're going to overcome this with your help and with God's blessing.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  Please go to infoworkstore.com and get this book.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  Many, many, many years of research have gone into this.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  The great reset and the war for the world available right now
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  at infoworkstore.com.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  There's also signed copies available as well.
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  We've got a lot of other big projects we're working on
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  that are about to start launching as well,
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  but this is the cavalry because we need the funding
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  and you need this book because it warns the world
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  of the globalist plan.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  Get the great reset at infoworkstore.com.
[1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  We are now into hour number two.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  Let's go to some of the insane, purposeful,
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  worldwide shutdown of economies to bring us to our knees.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  Here are some excerpts of Joe Biden saying in the last day
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  that we are not in a recession despite the fact the exact definition
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  of recession is two consecutive quarters with negative growth.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  And we are at negative growth for more than two quarters.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  Of course, this is far beyond a recession.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  This is an economic implosion, getting the workforce to give up,
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  destroying small businesses and infrastructure for the great reset.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  But towards the end, in another clip,
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  he admits this is a great transition we're in.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  Here it is.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  Both Chairman Powell and many of the significant banking personnel
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  and economists say we're not in a recession.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  That doesn't sound like a recession to me.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  Thank you very much.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  And how we transition from historic economic recovery
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  to a stable, steady growth and lower inflation
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  without letting go of all the historic gains we made over the last 18 months.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  Right now, there are an enormous set of global headwinds,
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  including a war in Europe and successive variants of the pandemic,
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  but our economy remains resilient.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  So they shut down the economy.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  They implode the Third World.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  They starve 60-plus million people to death.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  They go, well, despite the virus we released and our economic warfare against you,
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  we're strong.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  So while they crush you, while they destroy you, they tell you it's not happening.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  Here's the so-called White House Press Secretary gaslighting folks further.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  The D.C. Mayor sent the White House a letter asking for National Guard help
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  with migrants that have been bused here from Texas and Arizona.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  Is the President going to approve that request for the National Guard?
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  So as to your question on the National Guard,
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  I refer you to the Department of Defense.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  They will have that answer for you.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  We have been in regular touch with Mayor Bowser and her team.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  And I said this before.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  I said this last week about Republicans using migrants as a political tool,
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  and that is shameful and that is just wrong.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  There is a process in place for managing migrants at the border.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  This is not it, what they're doing currently.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  That includes expelling migrants as required by court order under Title 42,
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  transferring them to ICE custody or placing them in the care of local NGOs
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  as they await for the processing again.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  Okay, so let's just stop here because I was going to get to this clip later.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  We played a different clip, which is her gaslighting as well,
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  saying the Republicans are flooding the border, the Republicans are bad,
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  and the Democrat cities don't want Texas and Florida to bus the illegals to their cities.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  So that's more gaslighting, but the clip I wanted from her was the clip
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  dealing with her also denying that we're in a recession,
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  but we know they're all doing that, so we don't really need to play the clip for you.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  They're all saying that we are not in a recession, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  and the open borders are the Republicans' fault,
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  and they don't want people bused to their cities.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  They want them in your towns.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  And it just goes on and on and on from there.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  You know, I just at this point don't know how much more we can take.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  I mean, this really is 1984.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  And where do these people think they're going to live?
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  How do they think they're going to be doing during the destruction of civilization?
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  How do they think wrecking everything is going to make it better for them?
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  But they have this instinct.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  They have this drive that if they can just dominate and hurt people,
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  somehow that makes them more powerful.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  And for me, it's extremely sad and frustrating.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  But we're entering a period of total destruction and war and collapse by design.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  And I really feel sorry for the average person out there that still doesn't know
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  what they've been hit by and just how intense this is going to get.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  I mean, really, that's what this comes down to.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  Think about the fact that we have Fauci and Berks and all of them on TV.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  We played the clubs many times.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  Should I play them again?
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  Saying, oh, we knew the shot wouldn't work.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  Well, we knew that too. We told you.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  And then they censored everybody.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  So that information couldn't and wouldn't get out.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  And then now they say, but don't worry.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  We've got a new super shot that's going to fix all your problems as well.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  They are tightening the noose around our necks.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  Let's play clip 10.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  Here are two minutes of Democrats lying about inflation.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  I really doubt that we're going to see an inflationary cycle.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  Most economic analysts believe that it will have a temporary transitory impact.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  The faster than expected increase in some of those prices is actually a good sign.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  The overwhelming consensus is going to pop up a little bit and then go back down.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  No one's talking about this great, great deal.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  This is something that will settle down transitory.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  This shows that most of the price increases we've seen were expected and expected to be temporary.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  There's nobody suggesting that there's no such inflation on the way.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  It's highly unlikely that there's going to be long-term inflation that's going to get out of hand.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  I don't know anybody who's worried about inflation.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  Over the last couple of months, we actually saw it trend downward.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  President Biden's Chief of Staff Ron Klain enthusiastically retweeted an economist who had said in part
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  most of the economic problems we're facing, inflation, supply chains, etc., are high-class problems.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  What is the grand-home plan to increase oil production in America?
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  Oh my God, that is hilarious.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  Well, the number one thing that the president can do is help get COVID under control.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  That, we know, is the root cause of inflation.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  President Biden this afternoon saying he thinks we're at the peak of the crisis right now
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  and that lower prices are on the way.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  The inflation has everything to do with the supply chain.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  Make no mistake, inflation is largely the fall of Putin.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  I'm going to do everything I can to minimize Putin's price hike here at home.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  If you want to get rid of inflation, the only way to do it is to undo a lot of the Trump tax cuts.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  Ever since you've come into office, things are really looking up.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  You know, gas is up, rent is up, food is up, everything.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  The mayor of New York says they are in a complete and total collapse.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  The video is on infowords.com.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  Wall Street's collapsing. New York City mayor says, quote, we're in a financial crisis like you can never imagine.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  Wall Street is collapsing. We're in a recession.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  Adam said New York event hosted by nonprofit Project Hospitality is cited by the news outlets and it goes through what he had to say about that.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  So they can't even get their propaganda straight.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  And the reason they want shows like this one off is they don't want us to show you clips of them a few years ago versus now or even a month ago versus now.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  Here's one of Deborah Birx, again, who now admits the vaccine doesn't work and it was all a fraud and they knew it didn't work.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  Wow, that's the mission of criminal fraud. They've made hundreds of billions of dollars.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  They've poisoned a bunch of people and now they've got more shots coming out.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  We'll play this clip and come back from break.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  Truly achieve herd immunity is going to take through the summer and potentially even into the fall.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  That's getting, you know, 80, 70, 80% of Americans immunized.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  And I think we overplayed the vaccines and it made people then worry that it's not going to protect against severe disease and hospitalization.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  It will. But let's be very clear. 50% of the people who died from the amicron surge were older vaccinated.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever as we reach the critical heart of the battle that you spread the word and that you support liberty and that you warn people like you've never done before.
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  We have come so far together. Please help keep us from the year.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  We're under massive attack right now, but we're going to win with your help.

[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate our marriages.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  And the studies are all clear. The number one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  And the number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people having lasting, good, loving relationships. They want to break up society.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  And we are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world available as a major sponsor now.

[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  It's beautiful, how this deep, the melody settles down over me. I'm not bored or unhappy. I'm still so strange and I'm in the wind.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  I'm in the water with nobody's son, nobody's daughter, watching the lectures over the country club.
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  Serve me up, the redwood market, what to do next? Maybe we'll have a white picket can and shares over the country club.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Friday edition.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  And I'm just here looking at the news and watching what's unfolding and it's just totally insane.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  They've declared a worldwide U.N. emergency. They're talking about new lockdowns for monkeypox that they admit have not killed one person and is 99% in homosexual men.
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  This is the backdrop of what we've got going on here. And we've got mad scientists in government and corporate labs all over the world in an insane race to find new technologies that are all extremely dangerous.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  So everybody knows the parable, the legend of Atlantis, whether it's real or not, is that for debate.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  We built the new Atlantis and I've talked about this a lot and because people aren't governing themselves and aren't thinking about what they're doing because they've lost their morals or never had them,
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  they're just doing every horrible thing you can imagine, creating new microbes that aren't even made of plants or animals or insects that are just completely generated by computers that can easily get out and spread and take over the planet like the Andromeda
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  train. And then when I mentioned earlier in the first hour, yes, scientists turned dead spiders into gripping claws.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  Scientists have repurposed dead spiders into a device capable of picking up and moving small objects.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  It is heralded as the first step in neurobotics or necrobotics or the combination of a corpse and robotics.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  It all began when members of the Daniel Preston Medical Engineering Lab in Rice University, that's Texas, came across a dead spider.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  They wondered why the legs are always curled up. The students learned the mechanism involved in the system, a way to manipulate it in a lab setting.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  Apparently, these are the kinds of fun hijinks medical engineers get up to when they should be cleaning the lab. They just make a big joke about it.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  But imagine what's really going on. And imagine what this nanotech in these shots are doing to humanity.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  I want to play a short clip from CBS News where they talk about the necrobots, the zombie cyborg robot spiders.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  And again, for radio listeners, there's a spider picking up something over 100 times its weight.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  And when you see what scientists are doing, they're doing this to humans. They're treating us like we're nothing more than lab rats.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  Now, getting back to monkeypox, if you don't have some fun with this, you're going to go crazy. I know I am. So we should have some fun with it.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  Tucker Carlson had a vote. They have a new name for monkeypox, where it's coming from.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  Now, even though the U.N. said, I don't need to listen to them, it's true, 99% of the monkeypox cases around the world are homosexual men that are having multiple partners a day with hundreds of people every few months.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  And they're just absolutely giving each other every disease known to man.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  And so now, Tucker Carlson has developed a new name for the monkeypox.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  So monkeypox is about the coolest name ever for a disease. Can't come to that. It got the monkey.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  But they are changing the name because racism or something. Well, for once, we don't know who they are. We're not going to allow it.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  We're going to change the name this time. We're going to do it with the public's help because democracy is real.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  So we had a vote. There was no ballot harvesting. You can trust our counting.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  And the new name for monkeypox is now officially, and we're declaring it, shlong COVID.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  That won our audience election of about 40% of the vote. So let Rachelle Walensky, the CDC, know her number is 1-800-232-4636.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  Wait for the prompt on monkeypox and make your voice heard because it's still a democracy.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  Now, we've taken shots at Eric Swallow over the years. And to be fair, we want him to come on and respond.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  He will never come on. He's too busy. What's he doing? We don't know, but we just got this picture in.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  We think it's actually Eric Swallow. We don't know who he's talking to. Fang, Fang, we don't know.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  But he's clearly busy. So maybe that's why he's not accepting our offers to come on.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  But if he can break away and spend the time, he's always welcome on this show.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  Shlong COVID.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  Dr. Carlson slant over homophobic name for new monkeypox. It's cruel. No, it's cruel to have hundreds of sexual partners unprotected and spread diseases. I don't care whether you're heterosexual or homosexual.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  That is the reality here. But we're certainly not following God's plan.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  That's the thing that's really clear here. And we're marching towards thermonuclear war.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  We're abandoning all the things that made us great. We are letting corrupt corporations control our governments and annihilate our free speech, our new process, our privacy.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  And they're just getting started. And I got to tell you, the Republican leadership is almost completely mum on all of this.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  They're not talking about the issues that are real and the issues that energize the general public.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  And I get it. They've got into Congress. They want to keep their head down. You stick your head up too high. Well, you know what happened to Alex Jones.
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  But if everybody cowers, we all get destroyed. So you can sit there and look at people that stick their heads up and try to fix society and say, well, maybe I shouldn't do that.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  I'm just going to play it safe. But when everybody plays it safe, we have stagnation and collapse of civilization.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  But Trump is really starting to get it. If he'll just come out against the shots like Bolsonaro did and admit he was conned with what Berks and others have admitted, we can all get behind Trump again.
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  But I like what he's doing. We'll talk about it when we come back on the other side of this live Friday Worldwide broadcast.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  And Robert Barnes is coming in to co-host with me in the third and fourth hour today. Infowars.com, Tomorrow's News Today, and Band-Aught Video, with not just our content, but hundreds of other band creators with incredible information at Band-Aught Video.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  Please share that link.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  Please help keep us on the air. We're under massive attack right now, but we're going to win with your help. We're going to overcome this with your help and with God's blessing.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  Please go to Infowars.com and get this book. Many, many, many years of research have gone into this. The Great Reset and the War for the World, available right now at Infowars.com.

[1:32:57.000 --> 1:33:07.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:07.000 --> 1:33:13.000]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:15.000]  We think, just let me think.
[1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:20.000]  Even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:21.000]  It's chances at them.
[1:33:21.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  Damn it.
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:23.000]  Why?
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen, the annunciation of truth is here.
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  You decided, sir. You wanted it for a proof. You told me every television in London.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  And where once you have the freedom to object and everything can speak as you saw fit, you now have senses and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and...
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  Cameras.
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  How did this happen?
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  Who's to blame?
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  They will be held accountable.
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  I know why you did it.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  I know you were afraid.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  Who would it be?
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  War, terror, disease?
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  Fear got the best of you and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sattler.
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  He promised you order, he promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose sides has come. We are the resistance. We are the Info War.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  The biggest thing we can all do is recognize a bunch of fellow humans have joined evil and decided to play God and try to take all our basic rights away in enslave us.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  An example is, I was reading the news during the break about the show trial here in Austin, the first of three, two in Austin and one in Connecticut.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  And they had their media expert, the former editor of the Austin American Statesman, a guy that hates me on.
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  And when my lawyer got up to cross-examine, judge wouldn't even let him ask questions and said, you can't get into this stuff.
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  Oh, Jones isn't a journalist. Jones hurt people with things he said. Really, how'd he hurt him? Oh, you can't ask that question.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  Just like Steve Bannon's criminal trial that falsely convicted him in a D.C. jury two weeks ago. And this is the model for everybody.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  They are fully weaponizing the lawyers and the judiciary against the American people.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  But their whole system is coming down. And as long as we identify what they're doing and as long as we expose what they're doing, they will never get away with their end game.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  They will destroy themselves in the process and all the numbers and all the statistics and all the polls and the history and common sense absolutely 110% document that.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  But they're making their move against humanity in a big, big way right now.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  And this is just the process that we're going to have to go through. Here's an example. Again, this isn't about me. It's about all of us.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  I don't want to start talking about myself, but this is Texas Monthly. And it says, the free speech elephant in the Allen Jones courtroom.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  And it says, everyone's asking, why doesn't he have free speech? Everyone's asking why he couldn't question something. Everybody's asking, well, Jones didn't show up for court during the lawsuit.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  And so he's defaulted, it says. But none of that's true either. They sit there in the court with all our emails, all our records, everything more than anybody ever gave over in a defamation case.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  And they still default to this because they have to say I'm guilty and then tell a jury they decide how guilty and then not let us talk and not let us challenge anything and keep all our exhibits out.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  She won't let exhibits in about how less than one tenth of 1% of our coverage was Sandy Hook and analytics we have shown we made no money off of it, obviously.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  We barely ever talked about it and they went and dredged it up to demonize questioning anything. Just like they're demonizing you if you question a recession or open borders.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  Or if you say there's inflation, they tell you there isn't inflation. That's their answer to everything they're doing is a lie to us. Here's an example.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  Mother loses custody of daughter for refusing transgender status and saying she's a girl.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  A court decided a mother's custody of her daughter.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  2019 when she refused to validate her 12 year olds claim that she was transgender, the daughter Sophie never returned ever visiting her father.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  Ever she claims she felt unsafe being with her mother. Jeanette, a liberal feminist, is fighting to regain custody of her daughter without submitting the court's demand that she declare Sophie is now her son.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  They're going to cut her breast off next. Mutilation. If you tried to go into the doctor and say I want my finger cut off, they put you in a mental institution.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  But if you want your breast or your penis or your testicles cut out, they're all for it.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  Well, you raise your daughter liberal and see what happens.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  She lives in Chicago. Poor lady. I'm so sorry for her.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  Just unspeakable.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  Sweden is moving to emancipate children so they can be sterilized under the new gender law. That's what this is, making being sterilized a new right, a new fashionable thing, and the schools you put your children in confuse them and convince them that they have a right to do this.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  And their real goal is sterilizing children at age three. They've been sterilizing children in some parts of the world at age seven.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  That's where we are in the year.
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  2022.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  But there's good news.
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  Trump more and more is getting hardcore against the new world order to the next level.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  This is a video. Trump blasts sickos. In fact, I forgot to tell you to get this clip. Get the clip, please. Trump. Oh, you have the clip. Trump blasts sickos pushing sexual content in kindergarten. The society that refuses to protect his children.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  This is a society that soon will not be able to protect anybody.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  But a moment. And then now Trump comes out and says, nobody's gotten to the bottom of 9 11. What a true statement. And two days after he was on multiple TV channels.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  We put the clips many times saying there were bombs in the buildings. That's why I like Trump. So how can he see all that?
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  But not see that even Birx, his top advisor, or number two advisor at Rafauchi.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  But top White House advisor says, oh, we knew it wouldn't work, but we told him he would. She just gave him the out like Bolsonaro has to say, I didn't know they lied to me.
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  But again, by him going along with this, he signs himself up with it. He connects himself to it. And it's just bad, bad, bad.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  But the good news is, when he's at rallies, he says, I can't say the V word, but I still think it's good. And I'm proud of it and people booing in the face, which almost makes him endearing.
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  Because in the face of his own constituents, not like what he's doing, he's pigheaded and still thinks he's the right thing. So it's an attribute, but it's also a big, big, giant negative to be dealing with this.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  We've got the Trump clip will play when we come back and then I'm going to hit.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  There's a whole bunch of news breaking and I got to be honest with you. I'm just, I don't want to say I'm depressed because I know where this is all going, but I am dizzy that this is so dangerous.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  And that we're so deep now into this and I know where it goes next. And I am just here bracing for the near future crises, war, serious economic collapse, more power outages, food rationing.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  And oh, the answer is QR codes and rationing systems, which have already been brought in in Australia, Europe, and so many other areas like Sri Lanka.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  So it's all coming up on the other side of this quick break info wars.com to Mars is today. We're going to come out of break and play the Trump clip.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  And then we will continue with the news and so much more of Robert Barnes coming in in the third and fourth hour today. Don't forget band.video.
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  So sold out for more than six months.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the US that supplies the highest quality signature reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon and other US government agencies.
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  And now they have produced specifically for us this made America high end line at a very affordable price.
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  Whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone or big pouches that protect laptops and iPads or big bags that promote whatever electronics you want to put in like desktop computers.
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  It is all exclusively available at info wars.com under the Redux name.

[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  This is one of the hottest items out there today that's exclusively available at info wars store.com.
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  We brought the game changing product previously only available to major oil companies around the world to the civilian market.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  Two years ago, the bio pros for septic tanks for porta potties for RVs for your drains, your boats.
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  It goes on and on.
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  It'll eat the oil off of your driveway.
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  He's just had water, but it's been so successful.
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  Now we're selling it to major RV parks, pig farms.
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  You name it, because this stuff will eat anything that is organic.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  And it's exclusively available at the bio pros.com and now info wars store.com.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  We sold out of this for almost a year.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  We made a major purchase and it is now in stock for whatever your need is at info wars store.com.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  You'll also find instructional videos and more information at info wars store.com or the bio pros.com made America powered by
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  God's great creation.

[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet, especially as you get older, you gain weight even if you eat a lot less.
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  I got to tell you info wars is only about bringing you amazing products that really work.
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  So we looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of our operations with and we said,
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  what are the best selling natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that are out there?
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  We went and looked at the top 10.
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  They all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product.
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  But with our new product from X7 diet force, we got the very best concentrates of these known natural essences that's just two amazing things for your body.
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:39.000]  And so I've lost almost 40 pounds.
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  I'm so a little bit overweight in the last three months and I've been doing it using diet force and also exercise.
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  Well, now diet force is exclusively available right now at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  40% off infowarstore.com diet force.

[1:46:55.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  It really works.
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  This is a society that soon will not be able to protect anybody.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  This is a hallmark of cultural and social decay against which we should fight back very hard and very soon.
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  We don't have time to wait years to do this.
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  The sickos who are pushing sexual content in kindergarten were providing puberty blockers to young children who have no idea what a puberty blocker is.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  Neither do I, by the way.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  Neither do most of the people in the audience, as you smile.
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  Let's just say they're not good.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  They are not just engaged in acts of depravity, in many cases they are breaking the law and they should be healthfully accountable.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  And by the way, we should not allow men to play in women's sports.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to go back down to court here.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  This kangaroo court where they've already found me guilty, where they won't let us cross examine people, where they're raping and robbing everybody's freedoms in America.
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  And again, I'm not a victim.
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  I know the enemies are coming after us all.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  You are their victim.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  They want to victimize us all.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  I chose to get in the arena.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  I chose to fight these people.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  And they want info wars destroyed more than anything.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  And they know that our operating system of resisting the globalist, what I call 1776 worldwide, is the truth and is the most effective system to counter them.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  That's why they fear us so much.
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  So I take a lot of satisfaction in that despite all the pain.
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  And I thank you all for what you've done over the years to keep us on air.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  But now we're all together entering the crucible.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  That's not a rhetorical phrase.
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  We're in this together.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  We are literally having them destroy our borders, attack our children, devalue our currency, launch all these wars,
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  promote pedophilia, annihilate our free speech, spy on all of us.
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  We have tyranny.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  We have tyrants.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  And we've been vindicated in spades.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  Unfortunately, I would rather have backed us off.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  People say, oh, look, he said all this, what happened, it didn't happen.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  Instead, it's all happening.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  The most important work that we've ever done is happening now.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  Now, I want to explain something to you.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  We only make a few dollars off each book that's sold on Amazon.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  We sell them at infowarstore.com, the Great Recept of War for the World.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  And if we could sell, man, if we could sell 100,000 books at infowarstore.com,
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  that would really help us pay the bills.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  It's a great historic book to have and to share with others.
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  It exposes the whole New World Order plan.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  I'm really proud of this book.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  We worked really, really hard on this.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  And it blows away all the other best-selling Great Recept books out there.
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  Steve Bannon said, he said, the most important work since the founding fathers,
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  when you really read it, it gives the whole enemy battle plan.
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  And every claim I make, I show you a quote where they said it.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  This is a textbook, a blueprint of the enemy's operation.
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  You want to beat them, you got to have it.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  Sure, you'd already know about all this.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  Okay, buy a couple copies, buy five copies.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  And people of means buy 50 copies.
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  Go to Amazon, buy 10 copies, 20 copies right now.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  Get them.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  Give them to the library, give them to the police department,
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  give them to your pastor, give them to your doctor,
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  give them to your lawyer, give them to your wife, your husband, your coworkers.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  Now is the time to be all in.
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  It's number one in history and now 17 other charts.
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  It's number 50 as of this morning in the world
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  on the number one most important chart ahead of Obama's book
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  and Michael Obama's book are also known as Michelle Obama,
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  but he calls her Michael in five speeches.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  So we're ahead of Obama and we're ahead of his husband, Michael.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  So this is a big deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  And we need to get this book to number one in the world.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  Number one in the world.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  So as much as I want you to buy it at infowarsstore.com,
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  go buy a signed copy at infowarsstore.com.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  But get multiple copies from Amazon and get them out to everyone.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  You know, that's the place to get it because it'll drive it to number one
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  and use the enemy's own systems against them.
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  Continuing, Alex's War is now live and available.
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  It was number two on the charts the last few weeks on Apple pre-orders.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  And now it is available at alexiswar.com to watch the trailer,
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  to watch the film on Apple TV and iTunes.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  A very powerful film.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  Chronoslinger 28 Years of the Fight Against the Globalist.
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  Get it on Vimeo.
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  Get it on Odyssey.
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  Get it on Rockfin.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  Watch it on Locals.
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  Get it on Amazon Prime.
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  Get it on Google Play.
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  Get it on Microsoft Xbox.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  Buy it on YouTube.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  Get it on so many other platforms, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  And these folks have put a lot of money into this.
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  They're putting billboards up like the one you see on screen
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  in Los Angeles and other cities around the country.
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  We're fighting back.
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  I told you that we had more than 10 projects going.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  And we've launched several of them now working with folks.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  We've got at least eight projects.
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  I get a little extreme.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  I try to do too much, but they're all months behind.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  But several of them are going to be breaking the next month.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  Then a bunch of others are going to be coming after that.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  And I'm the kind of guy that goes to a buffet,
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  especially when I ran six models every couple of days
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  and looked at whites for two hours a day.
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  I would go to like a furs, like a cafeteria,
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  three plate loads of food.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  I don't do that now.
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  I eat one plate load of food and so fat.
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  But that's kind of how I am with resisting the globalists.
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  Back when I had plenty of money and extra money,
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  I didn't even try to raise extra money.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  We had plenty coming in years ago.
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  I supported and financed so many films and groups
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  and made just pure donations to invest in films,
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  exposing pedophilia and all the rest of it.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  But now we're crushed down in the resistance
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  to our Masada Hilltop here, or Alamo.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  And we need your support now more than ever.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  So I want to encourage you.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  I don't make money off Alex's war in the theaters.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  I don't care what the truth is getting out.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  But you can buy the DVD so they can't censor it.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  So it's in your archive.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  I share it with others.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  And then FullWarsHore.com.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  Screenings start this Friday.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  So you can buy tickets now in Hollywood, California,
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  Santa Monica, Waterloo, Indiana,
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  Addison, Illinois, O'Fallon, Illinois,
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  Grandville, Cape Girardi, Missouri,
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  Lake Ozark, Missouri, Elk River, Minnesota,
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  Oakdale, Minnesota, Fargo, North Dakota.
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  This is where patriots have been asking for it.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  Omaha, Nebraska, Las Vegas, Nevada, New York,
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  New York, Columbus, Ohio, Mentor, Ohio,
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  Cordoba, Tennessee, Franklin, Tennessee,
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  Austin, Texas, Gainesville, Wisconsin, and many others.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  This list is two days old.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  One told it's been added.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  More than 100 other cities.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  It's already 120 cities or so.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  It's showing at one theater in North Austin.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  We need those to sell out.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  And then it'll get put in theaters all over the country.
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  A major, major victory.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  This is a war of money, a war of energy,
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  a war of culture, a war of action.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  We're already number one in the history section.
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  World history, we're number one.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  U.S. history, we're number one.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  I think it's 17 or 18 sections we're number one in right now.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  Ahead of Klaus Schwab, Yuval Harari, Bill Clinton,
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, all of them.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  So do that and take action.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  Separately, vitamin mineral fusion has been
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  our overall best seller when it came out five years ago.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  Because people love it.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  It tastes so good.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  It makes them feel great.
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  Boost your immune system.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  All the essential vitamins and minerals of a high quality,
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  organic type you can absorb.
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  A natural type with the key amino acids.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  It's back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  Everybody should be taking it daily.
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  Just make a picture of it every few days or every week.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  Have a glass up in the morning or the evening.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  It tastes amazing.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  It's available infowarstore.com.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric formula was sold out for a long time.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  It's discounted back at infowarstore.com.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  And we have the new diet force.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  I go up and down in weight because if I work out every day
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  and eat good, I lose a lot of weight.
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  If I don't, I gain a lot of weight.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  That's a evolutionary adaptation.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  That's what they would call it.
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  But the point is, is that I haven't weighed in two weeks
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  and with this trial, I haven't been working out the last week
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  as soon as what happened.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  But with diet and exercise, we added diet force to it.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  I lost 39 pounds.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  And so people can see it too in my face.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  I'm still a really stocky guy.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  I got a 20-inch neck and 42-inch chest, the whole nine yards.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  But I have definitely lost a lot of weight with diet force.
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  Concentrated compounds help you naturally accelerate your metabolism
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  and more.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  Diet force is 40% off, but it's about to sell out.
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  So it's going to go to a regular price until it sells out.
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  So it's still at 40% off infowarstore.com.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  All right.
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  Robert Barnes is coming in.
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  He's going to cover the waterfront.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  And then I'm going to do a special Saturday show tomorrow.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  They're not going to be censored by these monsters.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  Stay with us.
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  We're under massive attack right now.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  But we're going to win with your help.
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  We're going to overcome this with your help and with God's blessing.
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  Please go to infowarstore.com and get this book.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  Many, many, many years of research have gone into this.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  The Great Reset and the War for the World available right now
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:31.000]  at infowarstore.com.

[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  We've got a lot of other big projects we're working on
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  that are about to start launching as well.
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  But this is the cavalry because we need the funding
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  to read this book because it warns the world of the globalist plan.
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:47.000]  Get the Great Reset at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:49.000]  Sold out for seven months.

[1:58:53.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  Turmeric's been known for thousands of years

[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:01.000]  your immune system, your libido.
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:06.000]  And look, the average type of the shelves is 5, 6, 7% pure humanoid.

[1:59:09.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  Nobody else decided to do it.
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  It's 95% humanoid at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula, 95% humanoid.

[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  And what's even more incredible is it funds the info war.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  So the only way you fail is not taking action today
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  and ordering Body's ultimate turmeric formula at infowarstore.com.

[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  The Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:17.000]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:19.000]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:21.000]  This is all confirmed. This is not a drill.
[2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  by the Communist Chinese government.
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  They've officially become state-run. Apple 100%.
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  Google is now making the transition
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship.
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man,
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  a demonized version of Alex Jones' suit.
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  This is happening. This is not like the other probes
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  before that were meant to get you used to probes, censorship,
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  This is a tie-traded dose reverse psychological warfare operation
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  that we adapt to being oppressed.
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover,
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  Total Internet of Things integration,
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  global social score, complete command and control system.
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  now attacking the United States with traders inside the major
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  security agencies blocking Trump's resistance of the program
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  of the chai comm slash big tech begging combine emergency situation.
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  and have been battering, ramming and out as much as I can.
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  They want to double use me as they always do
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  in any complex system of mathematical deception
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  So they take what I've said, be insincere,
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  build me into an insincere person in the strawman.
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  and so they make me a herder of children.
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they now use me as an archetype
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  to serve them by being the main distraction.
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  and it's being used against you.
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  I have given you the transmission. Now break free!
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  Thomas Jefferson.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  that the left doesn't like, at least in government.
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  and that's corporations.
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  The left have wised up to this.
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it.
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  The social media giants, and they are.
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them,
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  prevent them from speaking.
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  So far the most prominent casualty to crusade against free expression
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations in Big Tech
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  and saying, can you ban this person?
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist,
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  but this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment,
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  but instead attack dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent,
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  free press, working with Big Tech.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  People know what's true. They can smell it.
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  In a free country, everyone can be heard.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  Inter-talitarian societies only the powerful can be heard.
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  The globalist great reset or the war for the world is here,
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:08.000]  but humanity is not being caught flat footed because of Infowars and because of your support.
[2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:11.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever
[2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:15.000]  as we reach the critical heart of the battle that you spread the word
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:20.000]  and that you support liberty and that you warn people like you've never done before.
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:22.000]  We have come so far together.
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  Please help keep us from the year.
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  We're under massive attack right now, but we're going to win with your help.
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  We're going to overcome this with your help and with God's blessing.
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  Please go to infoworksforward.com and get this book.
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:37.000]  Many, many, many years of research have gone into this.
[2:05:37.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  The great reset and the war for the world available right now at infoworksforward.com.
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:45.000]  There's also signed copies available as well.
[2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:49.000]  We've got a lot of other big projects we're working on that are about to start launching as well,
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  but this is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:05:55.000]  because it warns the world of the globalist plan.
[2:05:55.000 --> 2:05:58.000]  Get the great reset at infoworksforward.com.
[2:06:03.000 --> 2:06:05.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:06:05.000 --> 2:06:09.000]  This is Robert Barnes' guest hosting for this hour.
[2:06:09.000 --> 2:06:13.000]  We're going to be talking about a range of topics including California's attempts
[2:06:13.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  to basically kidnap children from around the country
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:18.000]  and be able to bring them in for trans treatment
[2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:21.000]  according to a law that they're trying to propose and propound
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:26.000]  in the latest in entity and insanity out of California's legislative ranks.
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  But that's not all.
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:31.000]  We'll also talk and discuss the various efforts going around around the globe
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  in terms of Liz Truss likely to become the next prime minister of the United Kingdom
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:37.000]  and what that means, or if it means anything,
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  even as the Guardian, one of the most pro-war publications in the United Kingdom,
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  has a front page editorial about how their efforts have failed
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:51.000]  and the globalists have lost in their battle against Putin and Russia.
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  But first, everybody should remember that they are the front line
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  that continues to hold for Infowars against this extraordinary
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  and exceptional unparalleled and unprecedented legal attack
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  on Infowars and Alex Jones taking place in the show trial in Travis County, Texas.
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  What keeps Infowars on the air,
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:17.000]  what allows you to continue to access the information that you want,
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  is making the choice to become healthier, wealthier, and wiser
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  by supporting InfowarsStore.com, buying products that you like,
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  products that you want, products that you need, products that you benefit from.
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:35.000]  And in the process of doing so, do so at competitive pricing,
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  often priced substantially less than competitors for comparable quality,
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  while getting goods and ingredients independent and separate
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  from the big pharma, big retail company machine,
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:49.000]  directly wholesale, directly retailed right to you,
[2:07:49.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  and doing so by supporting a network in the process
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:58.000]  that keeps independent information accessible and available to people around the globe.
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  Who was the tip of the spear in fighting lockdowns?
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  It was Infowars.
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  Who was the tip of the spear in exposing the election fornication
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  that took place in November 2020?
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:10.000]  It was Infowars.
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  Who was the tip of the spear at promoting the candidacy of presidential candidate
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  then-president Donald J. Trump?
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  It was Infowars.
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  Who was the tip of the spear exposing the Ukraine conflict
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  against the warhors in both Congress and the mainstream press
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  and exposing it for what it has in fact become an extraordinary boondoggle
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  and exceptional grift for the Biden families of the world?
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  It was Infowars.
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  And this goes all the way back.
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  Who was it that was exposing that incubator baby story was a false and fake story
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  to get us involved in the First Iraq War?
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  It was a young Alex Jones, all the way back in the early 90s.
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  Who was exposing Ruby Ridge?
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  Who was exposing Waco?
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  Who was exposing what really happened in Oklahoma City?
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  Who was exposing what happened in 9-11?
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  Who was exposing the First Iraq, the Second Iraq War?
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  Who was exposing the Afghan War debacle?
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:07.000]  Who was consistently supporting Edward Snowden, whistleblowers like Julian Assange
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  who published those whistleblowers?
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  Again, it was Infowars.
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  It was Infowars.
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  The media only wants you to talk about a tiny, tiny, tiny slice of coverage
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  as Alex Jones put it in his interview with Glenn Greenwald at the premiere of Alex's War
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  which by the way is now available in cities across America today
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  and you can get it available and downloaded today
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  or you can purchase the DVD to keep it into posterity
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  given some of the digital copies can disappear overnight right at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  That documentary, which again is not even a pro-Alex documentary,
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  it's just here's who Alex Jones is, here's who's Alex Jones's history,
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  here's both sides of a bunch of the arguments and debate.
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  It quotes Megyn Kelly throughout the different parts of the documentary.
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  But it is a fair, impartial view of Alex Jones,
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  not a partial, prejudicial view like we are seeing from the joke of a judge in Travis County, Texas.
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  If you want to see what bad judges look like,
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  if you want to see what judges who lack a judicious temperament look like,
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  then you need to go no further than Travis County, Texas.
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  Indeed, if I was down there the other day and just when I came in the courtroom,
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  the plaintiff's lawyer started hopping around like a bunny rabbit,
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  yipping Bobby Barnes, Bobby Barnes, Bobby Barnes, that's how nuts these people are.
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  They're people that need a straight jacket, not anything else for Christmas.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  That's the nature of it, but it was more striking to me.
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  What I was wondering, how is there this case taking place
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  that appears to be nothing about what is supposed to be taking place?
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  Proportedly, this trial in Travis County, Texas is only about damages
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  because contrary to American legal principles, Alex Jones has been a judge guilty without a trial by jury.
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  So the only question is damages, yet we've heard almost no evidence that's actually about damages.
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  We've only heard a one-sided presentation of why one side thinks Alex Jones is guilty
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  when he's already been a judge guilty. So why is any of that evidence coming in?
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  Well, here's why. When I walked in, there are three big movie cameras set up in the courthouse.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  Three big movie cameras, one of them, by the way, staring right down at the jury.
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  So the jury knows they're part of an ongoing future film
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:28.000]  because they can't avoid it because the big camera is staring at them the entire case.
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:33.000]  What is this about? This is about the losing Neverland production company
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:37.000]  getting the rights to film exclusive rights by the judge
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  to film this show trial to create their own show trial.
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  And that is why they're presenting evidence that has nothing at all to do with damages.
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  Instead, all the evidence they're presenting is a one-sided presentation
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  to keep up the median myth, the median narrative about Alex Jones.
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  That Alex Jones only ever talked about Sandy Hook, that Alex Jones is the reason why anybody had doubts about Sandy Hook.
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  All false. They know it's false. There were tens of millions of views of other YouTube shows
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  and other various social media posts that challenged what happened at Sandy Hook
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  long before Alex Jones said anything about that particular subject matter
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  or interviewed any of those particular witnesses. They were all over the place.
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  There were media experts, law experts, philosophy experts, a bunch of people raising a whole bunch of different questions.
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  They were all over the place. Anybody who remembers it remembers it.
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  I was one of the people trying to explain why it was not accurate some of these theories at the time
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  but that clearly the politicians were hiding something.
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  So why is any of this evidence coming in in such a one-sided way?
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  Well, it's coming in because this is for a movie.
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  This is literally a show trial within a show trial, a show trial for a show trial.
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  The goal is to basically create a show that's going to actually be a televised show
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  and here's the benefit to the production crew, to the future HBO folks, whoever else is making it,
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  is that now they can do this one-sided presentation,
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  lead people to falsely believe it was actually an impartial trial on all of the evidence
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  when it was only a one-sided presentation of one side of the evidence
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  and because they are filming it in court, they can't be sued for lying
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  because when you produce, when you republish or re-broadcast something that happens in court,
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  then it's not subject to, it is immune from defamation and libel claims.
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  However, if the judge allowed Alex Jones' side to actually be heard meaningfully
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  to present all of the evidence, to present all of the videos,
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  according to the plaintiff's counsels, any editing of videos is altered.
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  Well, that means all of their evidence in the entire trial is altered evidence by their own definition.
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  But why do they want that altered evidence for an altered story?
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  Because the judge wants to be able to afford this production crew
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  to systematically build a fake narrative, a permanent show documentary
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  of a show trial, a show about a show trial,
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  in order to get people to believe something that's totally false
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  because if Alex Jones was allowed to present his side of the story,
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  then they would have to include those aspects in the documentary
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  because it wouldn't be fair reporting of the court proceeding.
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  You can't just report one side of a court proceeding
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  and thereby claim immunity if you repeated a false statement.
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  You can only do that if you were, if you impartially and neutrally
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  and fairly reported what happened in court.
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  So that's why the judge is rigging the court proceeding
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  to make sure that the script, and this is literally a script.
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  A script gets told in a certain way for future audiences.
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  The goal will be for particularly people who've never known, never heard about Alex Jones
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  to say, you can't go to Alex Jones. He's dangerous.
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:47.000]  You can't go to InfoWars. That's dangerous.
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  Those are the people that did this horrible thing
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  as found by an impartial independent jury after a full admission of the case
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  where Alex Jones was there to present a defense.
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  That's the goal of even having any kind of trial at all.
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  It's to be able to create the perception, the false perception
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  that there was actually a meaningful trial that occurred here when there wasn't.
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  This trial is a joke of a trial.
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  It does not conform to any constitutional standard
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  or any rule of law standard or any even rule of evidence standard
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  about how these cases are supposed to progress and proceed.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  And that is why you're witnessing what you are witnessing in Travis County.
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  That's the same reason, most likely, that the judge is often taking down
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:31.000]  the videos right after the trial happened.
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  She doesn't want the world to see the real trial.
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  She doesn't want the world to see the real evidence.
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  That's why this is truly a show trial within a show trial.
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  When we come back, we're going to discuss the various latest globalist plans
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  that are either backfiring or maybe backfiring on the rest of us.
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  That and more after the break here at InfoWars.
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:23.000]  People love it because it tastes great and they see the results.
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:25.000]  And it funds the InfoWars.
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  So sold out for more than six months.

[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  and all the things out there hurting everybody.

[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:40.000]  in the last few years.

[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  because they don't want people having lasting, good,
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:23.000]  loving relationships.
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  They want to break up society.

[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now,
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  including food, water, and survival gear

[2:19:57.000 --> 2:20:02.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:04.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:16.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:18.000]  This is Robert Barnes, guest hosting.
[2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:21.000]  Have you heard about SB 107,
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:25.000]  a recommended piece of legislation from California?
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:28.000]  Well, let me give you what their description is
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  according to publications favorable to it.
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:34.000]  It's California's trans-refuge bill,
[2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  that's what they're calling it,
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  could create a safe haven for trans youth.
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  The California is trying to propose a bill
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:46.000]  that the way in which it provides this protection
[2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:49.000]  is it would prohibit California from complying
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:51.000]  with any out-of-state subpoenas
[2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:55.000]  concerning medical information or other information
[2:20:55.000 --> 2:20:57.000]  about trans youth.
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  In other words, youth that are undergoing medical experimentation
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  as children to transition into a different gender.
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  It would also reject out-of-court state judgments
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  that threaten to remove children from their homes.
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  What does that mean?
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  Well, all of this really entails
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:16.000]  is there's a full faith and credit clause
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:18.000]  of the United States Constitution
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  that requires each state to recognize another state's judgment.
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:25.000]  It cannot unilaterally override that state's judgment
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:27.000]  based on internal legislation.
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:29.000]  There's also other provisions,
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  in particular in the family context,
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  that also require respect and recognition
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:35.000]  of another state's judgment.
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:37.000]  This is, in fact, the article goes on to detail.
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  This is focused on Texas particularly.
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:41.000]  Texas has made clear,
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:43.000]  as the Attorney General and others and the governor,
[2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  that attempts to force medical transitioning
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:51.000]  onto young children is child abuse.
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  The reason why they have concluded that
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:55.000]  is based on a wide range of medical evidence
[2:21:55.000 --> 2:21:58.000]  that basically challenges and questions
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  whether or not this could be ever a good idea for people.
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  There are many people already complaining
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:05.000]  that went through the treatment
[2:22:05.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  saying this treatment was a bad idea.
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  I would have gone through it.
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  I was too young when I took it.
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:13.000]  I wasn't in a state of informed consent.
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:15.000]  My parents were misguided and misdirected.
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  My doctor gave me poor information.
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  So because of it,
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  they're trying to prohibit it in the state of Texas
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  as or at least punish it
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:25.000]  and prescribe it as a form of child abuse
[2:22:25.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  to force a young child to undergo
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:29.000]  medical transition,
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:31.000]  surgeries or other
[2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:33.000]  chemical treatment that could have
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:35.000]  permanent altering effects
[2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:37.000]  on their well-being.
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:39.000]  So California's response to this
[2:22:39.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  is to try to pass a special law
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  that basically says,
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  we're not going to recognize Texas law.
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:47.000]  Not only that,
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:49.000]  if you have a judgment against you
[2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  as a parent for child abuse
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:53.000]  or if you have a judgment against you
[2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:55.000]  in terms of custody
[2:22:55.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  or if there's evidence that is
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:22:59.000]  in California concerning your abuse,
[2:22:59.000 --> 2:23:01.000]  then now you can escape to California
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  and California is a welcome
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:05.000]  state for the whole country.
[2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  They're not only a sanctuary for illegal immigration,
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:09.000]  not only a sanctuary
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  for abortions that would be illegal
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  in a particular state, they're now going
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:15.000]  to be sanctuaries for child abusers
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  and those who would harm children.
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  And allow those
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  children to mostly,
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  they're not going to be going by themselves
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:25.000]  unless California plans on just
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:27.000]  effectively legally kidnapping
[2:23:27.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  kids from across the country
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  so that they come without their parents to California
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  and are able to undergo
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  this experimental treatment
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  that has caused so much harm to so many people
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  as has been reported in the literature
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  and by those individuals themselves.
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:43.000]  Presumably it is also
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  an encouragement for parents
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  who lose custody battles
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:49.000]  in Texas or in other states
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  or lose other
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  battles in Texas concerning
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:55.000]  their efforts to force
[2:23:55.000 --> 2:23:57.000]  trans treatment on their children
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  to be able to escape to California
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  without any consequences
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  for that, without any legal
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  consequences for that.
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  This is a flagrant violation
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:09.000]  of the full faith and credit clause
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  of the United States Constitution.
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:13.000]  It is a complete violation
[2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:15.000]  of federal law specifically
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  written as part of treaties.
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:19.000]  The Uniform Interstate
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:21.000]  Family Support Act and other legislation
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  like it that I've
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:25.000]  litigated in the past
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:27.000]  on behalf of Wesley Snipes and others when it's been
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  misused and abused by jurisdictions
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:31.000]  previously that this is
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  an attempt to violate that as well.
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  So it's a flagrant ignoring of federal law,
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  flagrant violation of
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:39.000]  constitutional principle,
[2:24:39.000 --> 2:24:41.000]  and a flagrant attempt to interfere
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  with the parent-child relationship
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  and the interfere
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  and create and incentivize
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  children getting these experimental
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  treatments that again
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  many have complained about later.
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  That's the state of mind in California.
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:57.000]  That is why anybody
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  who stays in California
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  if you're there, you should only be there
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  because you have no other choice.
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  This is the direction California is going in.
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:07.000]  As City Journal reported today
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  its educational experiment
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  has been a complete debacle.
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  Its economic experiment has been a complete debacle.
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  Here you have a state
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:17.000]  with some of the most natural beauty
[2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  in the entire world.
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  A state that has Hollywood
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  and the movie industry
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  located within it
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  and yet the most common thing
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:29.000]  you will find in California these days
[2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  is a U-Haul truck
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  for people moving out, for people getting out.
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  Indeed, it began to
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  net lose population
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  for the first time in its entire history
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:41.000]  in the past few years
[2:25:41.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  due to the effects of its policies
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  and politics.
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  And this is despite being a sanctuary state
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  for illegal immigration. So this means
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:51.000]  its citizens are really fleeing
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:25:53.000]  trying to get out of California
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  or comifonia as I like to call it.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  And this latest bit of legislation
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  is a revelation on it.
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  Similarly, Massachusetts is passing abortion laws
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  that are an attempt to interfere
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  with other states' laws.
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  Because it's one thing to say
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  if you come to Massachusetts
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  we recognize abortion
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  at whatever rate we choose to do so.
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  That's Massachusetts business
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:17.000]  according to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision.
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:19.000]  What it is not Massachusetts business
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  is to try to interfere with Alabama
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  or interfere with Pennsylvania
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:25.000]  or interfere with Ohio
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  and induce people
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  to violate laws in Ohio
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  by coming to Massachusetts
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:33.000]  to do certain procedures.
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  At that point it becomes a conspiracy
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:37.000]  to commit a crime in the state of Ohio
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:39.000]  which the state itself is becoming
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:41.000]  complicit in. But that is the direction
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  things are going in.
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  What is the common theme between
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:47.000]  this Massachusetts case, the California case
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:49.000]  and even Austin
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  what's happening in Austin and Alex Jones's case
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  or what happened to Steve Bannon
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  or what's happening in the January 6 trials
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  or what's happening in the Justice Department
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  trying to weaponize its power against
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:01.000]  Donald John Trump to prevent him from running
[2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:03.000]  for office in 2024 with a bogus
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:05.000]  indictment or the Fulton County, Georgia
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:07.000]  office trying to do the same.
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  What they all have in common is that the left
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  views the law differently than everybody else.
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:13.000]  The left views the law
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:15.000]  as simply a tool,
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  as simply a means.
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:19.000]  All they care about is the outcome.
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  They don't care if you have due process of law
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  they don't care if constitutional rights
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:25.000]  are respected. They don't care if the process
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  is done by trial by jury, trial by judge
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:29.000]  or trial by nobody. They only care
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  about the outcome. Does the
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  outcome conform to their policy objective?
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  And they're willing and ready
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:37.000]  and eager to weaponize
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  everything to get there.
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  They're willing to ignore
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  compacts between the states.
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:45.000]  They're willing to ignore U.S. constitutional
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:47.000]  restrictions. They're willing to ignore
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:49.000]  federal law. They're willing to ignore
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:51.000]  in some cases their own state law is applicable
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  to a set of circumstances. They're willing
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  to ignore in some cases their own governor
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  as has happened repeatedly in Texas
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  with the Republic of Austin trying to pretend
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  it's independent quite frequently throughout
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:03.000]  the pandemic. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit Court
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  of Appeals had to reaffirm once again
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:07.000]  that the state of Texas has the right
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  to not allow school mask mandates
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  to go into place because lower courts
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  in Texas and other officials in Texas
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  were ignoring that order. It's all part
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  of a pattern and it's one we have to come
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  to terms with and recognize
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  in dealing with the modern-day
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:23.000]  legal left, which is they do not believe
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  in the rule of law. They only believe
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  in the rule of results. They only believe
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  that who, he who has the power, rules.
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  Not that he who rules should rule
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  conscientiously or constitutionally.
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  Until we accept that and understand
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  that, we won't be able to meaningfully
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  predict what they do or resist what they
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  do as all of you continue to do.
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  When we come back into
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  the court of public opinion and other
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  matters, we will be discussing
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  whether or not Trump's indictment
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  could in fact prevent his candidacy in
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  2024 or whether it will just
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:29:21.000]  be a little bump
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  together.
[2:29:57.000 --> 2:29:59.000]  The number one selling
[2:29:59.000 --> 2:30:01.000]  category in supplements worldwide
[2:30:01.000 --> 2:30:03.000]  is fat burners, is
[2:30:03.000 --> 2:30:05.000]  weight loss formulas. And listen,
[2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:07.000]  there are hundreds of them out there that work,
[2:30:07.000 --> 2:30:09.000]  but most of them do it
[2:30:09.000 --> 2:30:11.000]  in a toxic way.
[2:30:11.000 --> 2:30:13.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we went out and did
[2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:15.000]  deep research on the safest, healthiest
[2:30:15.000 --> 2:30:17.000]  ways to take
[2:30:17.000 --> 2:30:19.000]  your overall body's metabolic
[2:30:19.000 --> 2:30:21.000]  system and your metabolism
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:23.000]  and turn that
[2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:25.000]  clock back by turning
[2:30:25.000 --> 2:30:27.000]  up your metabolism.
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Diet Force
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:31.000]  does it in a clean, healthy way.

[2:32:03.000 --> 2:32:05.000]  around the world to the civilian market
[2:32:05.000 --> 2:32:07.000]  two years ago, the BioProse
[2:32:07.000 --> 2:32:09.000]  for septic tanks, for porta-potties,
[2:32:09.000 --> 2:32:11.000]  for RVs, for your drains,
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:13.000]  it goes on and on. It'll eat the oil
[2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:15.000]  off of your driveway if you just add water.

[2:33:25.000 --> 2:33:27.000]  Who was on Epstein's
[2:33:27.000 --> 2:33:29.000]  list? Who was in Epstein's little black
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:31.000]  book that they had during the Ghislaine Maxwell
[2:33:31.000 --> 2:33:33.000]  trial? And we'll be discussing
[2:33:33.000 --> 2:33:35.000]  that and more and discuss maybe a little
[2:33:35.000 --> 2:33:37.000]  bit of the background of Ghislaine Maxwell
[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:39.000]  and why Epstein may have actually been
[2:33:39.000 --> 2:33:41.000]  recruited into the Maxwell
[2:33:41.000 --> 2:33:43.000]  extortion and blackmail ring
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:45.000]  rather than be the one who recruited
[2:33:45.000 --> 2:33:47.000]  Maxwell into it
[2:33:47.000 --> 2:33:49.000]  involving a little story about
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:51.000]  her father. Might even involve
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  a brief little story about
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  Bill Barr and his dad.
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:57.000]  But before that, a good article
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  in Compact Magazine today
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  by Michael Anton. Michael Anton
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:03.000]  is a great scholar and intellectual
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  associated with both Hillsdale and Claremont
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  has been one of the key advocates
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  for Trump all the way back to the 2016
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  campaign and he wrote
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  a good article entitled
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:15.000]  They Can't Let Him Back In.
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  This is at Compact Magazine.
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  And what does Michael Anton
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:21.000]  mean? Well, let's
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:23.000]  read from part of the article.
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  The people who really run
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:27.000]  the United States of America
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  have made it clear that
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  they can't and won't
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  if they can help it
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:35.000]  allow Donald Trump to be
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  president again. In fact,
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:39.000]  they've made this clear many,
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:41.000]  many, many times.
[2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  And he goes through what's really behind
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:45.000]  all of this and that it's a real
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  threat and a plausible threat and a
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  real threat to Trump.
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  Because what you're really seeing, if you want
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:53.000]  to parallel, go back and look at Axios's
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:34:55.000]  article from a couple of weeks ago
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:34:57.000]  where Axios outed that people
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:34:59.000]  around Trump are planning
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:01.000]  and coordinating to take out
[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  the deep state when and if
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:05.000]  Trump gets back in.
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  And
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:09.000]  why is that significant?
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:11.000]  That's really a signal. It isn't
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:13.000]  Trump's people who are leaking that.
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:15.000]  That is a signal to the deep
[2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:17.000]  that Trump is coming for the deep state.
[2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:19.000]  Now, why does that matter?
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:21.000]  Our interview yesterday
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  with Marc Grober
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:25.000]  went into some details about why it mattered
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  because it parallels
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  what the deep state was up to
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  during the presidential campaign of one
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  Robert Francis Kennedy
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:35.000]  in 1968
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  and how did that end?
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  So it's the same perilous threat
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  to the president. An effort first
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  will be made to indict him
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  and remove him by other legal means.
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  The other effort that has already been a foot
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:49.000]  for the last year has been January 6th.
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:51.000]  I mean, basically what you have had
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  since, arguably,
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:55.000]  August of 2016
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:35:57.000]  is a continuous effort
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:35:59.000]  of a coup against Donald Trump.
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:01.000]  First to prevent his campaign from being
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:03.000]  successful in 2016,
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  then multiple efforts
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:07.000]  to derail his presidency
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:09.000]  beginning from the day he got elected.
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:11.000]  Indeed, from the day he got
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:13.000]  nominated, some of this goes
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  all the way back to March of 2016.
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:17.000]  This has been a continuous effort
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  to destroy the presidency
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:21.000]  of Donald Trump. Why?
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  To protect the deep state.
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  When Michael Anton talks about those
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  who really run America,
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  you can make a reasonable inference as to
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:31.000]  who it is he is, in fact,
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:33.000]  talking about.
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:35.000]  And for people out there that sometimes question
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:37.000]  what the deep state is,
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:39.000]  the deep state actually has an old history.
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:41.000]  It's a history that has been
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  passed down to the economists,
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  the writer for the economists
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  in the 19th century, late 1800s,
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:49.000]  trying to describe what was happening
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:51.000]  to Britain in the rise of its colonial empire
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:53.000]  as to how so much of its government
[2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:55.000]  could be immune and impervious
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:36:57.000]  from public will and public opinion.
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:36:59.000]  And the reason was because
[2:36:59.000 --> 2:37:01.000]  a dual state had developed,
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:03.000]  one that was elected, one that wasn't.
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:05.000]  And this administrative dual state
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  increasingly governed actual well-being
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  and policies without regard
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  to what the public wanted or
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  insisted upon or whom even they elected.
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  The same pattern continued
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:17.000]  and when the various
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:19.000]  German philosophers and political
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:21.000]  scientists escaped Nazi Germany,
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:23.000]  they tried to understand the rise of fascism
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  in both Italy and Germany and they concluded
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  it was the same dual state
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  administrative state apparatus that facilitated
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:31.000]  the rise of Naziism
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:33.000]  and fascism in Europe.
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  In the same vein, it was the left
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:37.000]  historian Peter Dale Scott in the late 1960s
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  who used the phrase
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:41.000]  how do you explain the dual state
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:43.000]  when it has national
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  security power, when it has
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  military power, when it has
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  law enforcement power, when it's at the top
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:51.000]  of the political hierarchy of our law
[2:37:51.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  enforcement and military institutions.
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:37:55.000]  Well really it's a dual state
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  that is deeply entrenched.
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:37:59.000]  In other words, a deep state.
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:01.000]  And that's where the term originated.
[2:38:01.000 --> 2:38:03.000]  Some people think it originated with Turkey
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:05.000]  in the late 2000s, that's not true.
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:07.000]  It originated in the west
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:09.000]  to describe England, to describe fascism,
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  to describe the United States
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  and what Eisenhower himself
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  called the military industrial complex
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  when he left
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  in his exit address
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  in 1961. So that's
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:23.000]  what Anton is talking about. The reason
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:25.000]  for the Axios piece, the reason for these other
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  stories is it's the deep state
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  preparing to take out Trump.
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:31.000]  And so they tried to, throughout his presidency
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  didn't impeach him just once, they impeached him
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  twice, tried to get him indicted through
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  Robert Mueller, tried to
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:39.000]  coerce and extort different policy
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  promises during his presidency
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  with the threat of Robert Mueller going
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  after family members and friends and allies.
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  Was successful
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:49.000]  to use the Robert Mueller investigation
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  and inquiry in order to
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:53.000]  remove General Flynn and his allies
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  from the administration so the
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  deep state could have more carte blanche control
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  in terms of actual administrative policy
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  on the grounds. They've all admitted this
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:03.000]  afterwards. Different generals have admitted
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  that they lied and betrayed the president
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:07.000]  in terms of what was happening in Syria,
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  that they lied and betrayed the president in terms of
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  what was happening in Iran, that they lied
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:13.000]  and betrayed the president in terms of what was
[2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  happening in Afghanistan, that they lied
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  and betrayed the president about what was going on in Ukraine.
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:19.000]  Not only that, we now know
[2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:21.000]  as Deborah Birx has freely and fully admitted
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:23.000]  in her little book tour, she
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  lied repeatedly to the Trump
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  administration in terms of COVID policy
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:29.000]  and lockdown policies. We already know Anthony
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  Fauci did because he was caught lying just
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:33.000]  earlier this week. So these deep state
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:35.000]  actors were able to undermine
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:37.000]  the president's campaign and
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:39.000]  the president's actual
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:41.000]  ability to be the
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  chief officer of the executive branch
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:45.000]  of the United States government. And then
[2:39:45.000 --> 2:39:47.000]  that culminated, of course, in the stolen election
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:49.000]  of 2020. They hoped that
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:51.000]  January 6 would be sufficiently
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  explosive, that they could use
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:55.000]  January 6 to permanently discredit
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:39:57.000]  Trump and permanently discredit Trump supporters.
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  They believed
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  some of the things that were being put up on
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:03.000]  social media message boards that
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  this would truly get out of hand. And they
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  facilitated it by
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:09.000]  withdrawing the number of security that should
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  have been present, by not having the
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  National Guard present. Same DC
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:15.000]  mayor now wants the National Guard to deal
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  with illegal immigration being sent her away.
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  It tells you what they were really up to.
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:21.000]  By not, by actually
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  provoking some of the incidents, by having
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:25.000]  instigators, informants, and infiltrators
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:27.000]  amongst the crowd
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:29.000]  to make sure it went in a certain
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  direction, but it never got as violent
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  as they wanted it to be. Most people
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:35.000]  are simply being charged with misdemeanor
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  trespass. More than 99
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  percent of the people that went there
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  aren't being charged with anything, because they
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  didn't do anything wrong. There's
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  very few people being charged with any kind
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  of violence, and the only victims
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  that day in terms of dying were people
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  who were the part of the
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:53.000]  rally, not anybody that was part of the Capitol
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:55.000]  Police. It was people that were killed
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:40:57.000]  by members of Capitol Police
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  and others that were associated
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  with security at the Hill. They thought
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  that would take out Trump. Didn't work.
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  So then they go next with the January 6
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  committee hearings, and they hope that will take out
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:09.000]  Trump. It has not worked. That is
[2:41:09.000 --> 2:41:11.000]  why they're looking at escalating now to
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  trying to maybe indict Trump with
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  the Justice Department in the District of
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  Columbia, or the DA in Fulton County,
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  Georgia, or both.
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:21.000]  The problem is, they don't have a case.
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  It is your legal constitutional
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  right to have your own electors,
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  your own contingent set of electors,
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  when you file an electoral contest.
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:31.000]  I was part of the president's election
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:33.000]  legal team in Georgia during
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:35.000]  a key part of that, and that is entirely
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  constitutionally correct. That's not a crime
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  by any stretch. So ultimately
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  that will fall apart.
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  And then the question becomes, what do
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  they try and do next?
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  And the point of Michael Anton's article
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  is that Trump and everybody around
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  Trump should be prepared and ready
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:53.000]  to deal with that. But he also explains
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  what the real objections are.
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:57.000]  Anti-Trump hysteria
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:41:59.000]  is in the final analysis,
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  not about Trump.
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:03.000]  The regime can't allow Trump to be
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  president, just like they can't allow
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:07.000]  Alex Jones to be on the air.
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  Not because of who he is.
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  Although that grates them.
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  But because of who his followers are.
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  That class,
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  country class, must not be
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  allowed representation by candidates
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  who might implement their
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  preferences, which also and above
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:25.000]  all must never be allowed.
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  The rubes have no standing
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  to affect the outcome of a political process
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:31.000]  because we are just the rubes
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  and the elites are the ones who should govern.
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  That's what the attacks on Trump
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  are all about, just like that's what
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  the attacks on Alex Jones are all about.
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  It's an attack on you, the people.
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  And that is why as long as you continue
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  to hold the line and stay at the front
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  of the line by supporting InfoWars
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:49.000]  at infowarstore.com, their ability
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  to break us won't
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:53.000]  happen. So hold the line and
[2:42:53.000 --> 2:43:15.000]  we'll be back after the break.
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:25.000]  We're under massive attack right now
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  but we're going to win with your help.
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  We're going to overcome this with your help
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  and with God's blessing. Please go to

[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  Many, many, many years of research have gone
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:37.000]  into this. The great reset
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:39.000]  and the war for the world available

[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:45.000]  available as well.
[2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:47.000]  We've got a lot of other big projects we're working on
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  that are about to start launching as well
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:51.000]  but this is the cavalry because we need
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  this book because it warns the world of the
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:55.000]  globalist plan. Get the great reset

[2:43:57.000 --> 2:43:59.000]  Seven months ago in December of 2021
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:01.000]  we launched the first
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:03.000]  and the three-coin founding member series
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:05.000]  George Washington slaying the dragon.
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  Then we launched
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:09.000]  the Tree of Liberty coin and finally
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:11.000]  the Second Amendment come and take it
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:13.000]  Molan Lobby coin. There are only
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:15.000]  75 coins left
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:17.000]  in the three-point series

[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  chasing the wolf in a personal message.
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:37.000]  It's your last chance to get all three
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:39.000]  coins at 1776.com
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  This is history happening
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:45.000]  now infoworkstore support
[2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:47.000]  is changing the world and this
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:49.000]  is the final 75

[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:53.000]  available at 1776.com
[2:44:57.000 --> 2:44:59.000]  If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:01.000]  especially as you get older you gain weight
[2:45:01.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  even if you eat a lot less
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:05.000]  I gotta tell you info wars is only

[2:45:07.000 --> 2:45:09.000]  that really work. So we looked at
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:11.000]  the supplement market that we find a lot of our operations with
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:13.000]  and we said
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:15.000]  what are the best selling natural
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:17.000]  healthy anti-fat weight loss
[2:45:17.000 --> 2:45:19.000]  products that are out there.
[2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:21.000]  We went and looked at the top 10
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:23.000]  and they all had the same ingredients
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:25.000]  in common that is in this product
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  but with our new product from X7

[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:49.000]  that continues to protect info wars
[2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:51.000]  from the mass assault taking place
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  one of the stories that info wars
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:55.000]  constantly covered that other people said
[2:47:55.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  couldn't possibly be true
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:47:59.000]  is high-ranking elites
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  running secret black male
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  extortion rings involving
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  underage and other criminal
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  activity involving sexual
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  deviancy and either
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:11.000]  young girls or others
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  well of course we all now know
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  that the Jeffrey Epstein case was no fake
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  case it was a real case
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:19.000]  well of course Epstein himself
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:21.000]  magically managed to kill himself
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:23.000]  in a prison cell that was designed
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  so that you couldn't kill yourself
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:27.000]  but of course we can't know what really happened
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  because the cameras magically malfunctioned that day
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  Elaine Maxwell has now been convicted
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:33.000]  at trial and the question is
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:35.000]  what was in a black book
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:37.000]  that was introduced at trial but all the names redacted
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  was it a black book that includes
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  Jeffrey Epstein's client list
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:43.000]  to understand the sort of further background
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  of the Epstein dynamic
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:47.000]  because Epstein may not have been the one
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:49.000]  to recruit Maxwell
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  she may have been the one to recruit him
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:53.000]  why because there were rumors for quite some time
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:55.000]  that Elaine Maxwell's father
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  Robert Maxwell
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  was involved in a range of illicit activities
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:01.000]  in spy services around the globe
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:03.000]  connected to MI6
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:05.000]  connected to Mossad
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:07.000]  connected to the KGB
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:09.000]  connected to the CIA
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:11.000]  he seemed to be sort of a deep state grace based man
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  a middle man if you will
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  operating at the behest and on the behalf
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:17.000]  of institutional insiders
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  and intelligence services
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:21.000]  around the globe
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:23.000]  he mysteriously died by
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:25.000]  falling off his boat
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:27.000]  happened right around the time he might have started
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  out certain secrets
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:31.000]  not long after that is when
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:33.000]  Epstein shows up doing the deals
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:35.000]  he's doing with certain people
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:37.000]  including with Victoria's secret
[2:49:37.000 --> 2:49:39.000]  founder and others
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  and ultimately suddenly having a magical
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  life of magical wealth
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:45.000]  a huge ranch in New Mexico
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  a beautiful mansion
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  in New York City
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  the entire island in the Caribbean
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:53.000]  his own private plane
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  the Epstein Express
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:57.000]  a particular favorite of one William Jefferson Clinton
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  and then later all
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:01.000]  everything was outed after it was
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:03.000]  initially and originally covered up
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  in the early 2000s
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:07.000]  about his involvement with many
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  underage girls
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  other illicit human trafficking
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:13.000]  activities for which he was
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  ultimately charged only after public
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  outrage then mysteriously died while waiting
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:19.000]  trial and now Ghislaine Maxwell
[2:50:19.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  is in prison and the question is
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  what was in those files that got redacted
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  by the court what else is in
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  the government's discovery that might disclose
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:29.000]  if you're involved in a trafficking ring
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:31.000]  well who are you trafficking to
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:33.000]  who are the clients who are the customers
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  well Gateway Pundit is taking legal action
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  to try to find that out
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  they have filed they have retained counsel
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  and are filing in court requests
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  to unseal a range
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:45.000]  of file and documents much as
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  Mike Cernovich had previously done
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  in New York to unmask
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  aspects of what was taking place in the
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  Epstein case so hopefully
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:55.000]  we will finally see some information
[2:50:55.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  about where these trails will lead
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:50:59.000]  now at the same time
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:01.000]  another man another movie was made about
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:03.000]  maybe just about to be released
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  back to Russia
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:07.000]  a movie years ago called the Lords of War
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:09.000]  with Nicholas Cage
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:11.000]  was a thinly
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:13.000]  disguised biography
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:15.000]  of one of the world's most famous
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:17.000]  arms runners and gun runners
[2:51:17.000 --> 2:51:19.000]  around the globe now he was
[2:51:19.000 --> 2:51:21.000]  on all sides and as
[2:51:21.000 --> 2:51:23.000]  famously portrayed in the movie that appeared
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  to afford him an extraordinary
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:27.000]  degree of unique immunity
[2:51:27.000 --> 2:51:29.000]  but later on he became
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:31.000]  apparently according to the CIA
[2:51:31.000 --> 2:51:33.000]  a little too buddy buddy with Putin
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:35.000]  and so the US government basically
[2:51:35.000 --> 2:51:37.000]  as the court later would admit set him up
[2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:39.000]  they entrapped him they entrapped
[2:51:39.000 --> 2:51:41.000]  him in a case that he wouldn't have otherwise been involved with
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:43.000]  but for the entrapment classic definition
[2:51:43.000 --> 2:51:45.000]  of it but no federal judge was going to take
[2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:47.000]  on the CIA so even though the judge said
[2:51:47.000 --> 2:51:49.000]  gave him the minimum sentence but the minimum
[2:51:49.000 --> 2:51:51.000]  sentence was 25 years because of entrapment
[2:51:51.000 --> 2:51:53.000]  so apparently we're going to send the Lord
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:55.000]  of War back to Russia
[2:51:55.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  in exchange for a WNBA player
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:51:59.000]  who appeared to have been
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:01.000]  actually kind of trafficking giving the amount
[2:52:01.000 --> 2:52:03.000]  of money it was amount of drugs
[2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:05.000]  provided but at a minimum was smuggling
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:07.000]  illegal drugs into Russia
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:09.000]  but because he's popular with
[2:52:09.000 --> 2:52:11.000]  the woke community and the
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:13.000]  5 or 6 fans who actually follow the
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:15.000]  WNBA in America that has
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  been enough to influence the Biden
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:19.000]  administration as well as a person who some
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:21.000]  suspect might have been
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  a CIA tide or connected who was also
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:25.000]  in Russian jail those two will be
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:27.000]  released primarily the big name
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  is the WNBA star in exchange
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:31.000]  for sending the Lord of War right back to Russia
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  that shows you how the world
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:35.000]  really operates but on the
[2:52:35.000 --> 2:52:37.000]  white pill front a big
[2:52:37.000 --> 2:52:39.000]  huge settlement out of
[2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:41.000]  Illinois in the vaccine mandate
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:43.000]  context the great lawyers at
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:45.000]  Liberty Council brought a major
[2:52:45.000 --> 2:52:47.000]  claim against a healthcare provider
[2:52:47.000 --> 2:52:49.000]  who had discriminated and denied
[2:52:49.000 --> 2:52:51.000]  all religious objections
[2:52:51.000 --> 2:52:53.000]  and accommodations and for those folks
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:52:55.000]  that don't know remember title 7
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:52:57.000]  of the civil rights act and titles you to
[2:52:57.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  reject on religious grounds
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:01.000]  and that doesn't require permission or approval
[2:53:01.000 --> 2:53:03.000]  from any particular religious leader
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:05.000]  you don't have to go to church you don't even
[2:53:05.000 --> 2:53:07.000]  have to be a theist it's simply
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:09.000]  a belief of conscience
[2:53:09.000 --> 2:53:11.000]  so if your conscience believes that it's wrong
[2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:13.000]  to go forward with any particular
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:15.000]  medication or other invasion
[2:53:15.000 --> 2:53:17.000]  of your body then you can
[2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:19.000]  assert an objection to any vaccine
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:21.000]  mandate in your employment
[2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:23.000]  context also can apply to the government
[2:53:23.000 --> 2:53:25.000]  also can apply to
[2:53:25.000 --> 2:53:27.000]  these public accommodations
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:29.000]  as well so the in that
[2:53:29.000 --> 2:53:31.000]  context they were denied their religious
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:33.000]  accommodation objections by a medical
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:35.000]  facility in Illinois so Liberty
[2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:37.000]  Council brought a substantial class
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:39.000]  action challenging what they were doing
[2:53:39.000 --> 2:53:41.000]  well announced today in federal court
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:43.000]  a massive settlement
[2:53:43.000 --> 2:53:45.000]  there the they're going to have to pay
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:47.000]  more than ten million dollars
[2:53:47.000 --> 2:53:49.000]  the employer who denied all of these
[2:53:49.000 --> 2:53:51.000]  accommodations going to have to write
[2:53:51.000 --> 2:53:53.000]  a ten million dollar plus
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:55.000]  check to the lawyers
[2:53:55.000 --> 2:53:57.000]  and the people mommy almost all that money
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:53:59.000]  will go to the employees who got screwed
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:01.000]  and shafted out of what took place
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:03.000]  in some cases some will be making
[2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:05.000]  you know getting as much as almost three hundred thousand
[2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:07.000]  dollars so that they're going to get
[2:54:07.000 --> 2:54:09.000]  rewarded and compensated for the damages
[2:54:09.000 --> 2:54:11.000]  that they suffered from their employers
[2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:13.000]  wrongful action not only that the
[2:54:13.000 --> 2:54:15.000]  employers being effectively
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:17.000]  deterred from doing this ever again in the
[2:54:17.000 --> 2:54:19.000]  future by the nature of the settlement
[2:54:19.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  agreement and this will send shockwaves
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:23.000]  throughout the private employment
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:25.000]  universe that thought they were immune
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  and why was that because
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:29.000]  a lot of private employers their
[2:54:29.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  big corporate employers the Tyson
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  foods of the world take their legal
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:35.000]  advice from big corporate
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:37.000]  law firms but they probably should
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:39.000]  have double check who was on the list
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:41.000]  of the customers and clients
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  of those big corporate law firms
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  what was some of the favorite investments
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  of some of those big corporate law
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:49.000]  firms because if they had
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:51.000]  found conflicts of interest
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:53.000]  many of the big corporate law firms
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  that gave bad advice
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:54:57.000]  to corporate employers to try to impose
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:54:59.000]  this vaccine mandate
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  in the first place and then not to
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:03.000]  recognize religious and medical accommodations
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:05.000]  either
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:07.000]  also either have partners who invest
[2:55:07.000 --> 2:55:09.000]  in or actually have clients
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:11.000]  who are big pharma
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:13.000]  so they had a conflict of interest
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:15.000]  they were serving the interest of their big pharma
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:17.000]  client at the expense
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:19.000]  of the interest of their private employer
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  client and because of that
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:23.000]  they made bad advice and took bad
[2:55:23.000 --> 2:55:25.000]  tactics and made bad decisions
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  and people filed righteous suits
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  that are now starting to see vindication
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  and validation in the courts
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:33.000]  similarly in the military
[2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  context a federal court has issued
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  a permanent injunction
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  against any efforts to mandate
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:41.000]  or discipline anyone for not following
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  the vaccine mandate who asserted a
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:45.000]  religious accommodation in the Air Force
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  this is going to this follows the Navy
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:49.000]  seal case that's similar this is going
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:51.000]  to be repeated across the country in my
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  view ultimately every member of the
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:55.000]  military will ultimately be protected
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:55:57.000]  from disciplinary action
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  at least as it relates to their employment
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  and future benefits
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:03.000]  in the military maybe not for deployment
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:05.000]  that the Justice
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:07.000]  Cavanaugh unfortunately carved out
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:09.000]  a temporary exception
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:11.000]  for but as to everything else
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  I think the religious accommodation protections
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:15.000]  will ultimately be enforced as we are seeing
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  and as we saw yesterday in another
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  federal court striking down
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:21.000]  Biden's attempt to impose a vaccine
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:23.000]  mandate without regard to religious
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  accommodations and religious objections
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  and religious beliefs in the military
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:29.000]  this is the second big
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  permanent injunction when after the one
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:33.000]  in Texas for Navy SEALs
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  so you're going to see this extended and you're going to see this expanded
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  as these cases progress
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  and proceed through the judicial process
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:41.000]  in fact I that's why I
[2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  put up a template of an example
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  of a letter that people could use
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:47.000]  all the way back at peoplebarnslaw.locals.com
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  that people could find
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:51.000]  and see what is the language that has
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:53.000]  been found to be legally
[2:56:53.000 --> 2:56:55.000]  correct and legally appropriate
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:57.000]  for asserting religious accommodations
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:56:59.000]  against employer mandates
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  but those few employers that continue to
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  hold out should look at that case
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:05.000]  should look at that 10 million dollar
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:07.000]  plus settlement this was a settlement
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:09.000]  I mean this wasn't even an ultimate verdict
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:11.000]  10 million dollar plus settlement
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  and ask themselves whether they want to continue
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:15.000]  to go down that path or whether they want to

[3:01:11.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  this book is that important
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:17.000]  if you compare the finest

[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:25.000]  add the electronic part of it
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:27.000]  NPR, PBS all of it

[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:33.000]  and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  versus what your collective body
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:37.000]  has put out there
[3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:39.000]  and just watching it
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  Alex Jones is the head of this
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:43.000]  they're just in this huge revolution
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  against choice
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:47.000]  and free will
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  and normal technological development
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:51.000]  and adoption of technology
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:53.000]  that empowers humanity
[3:01:53.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  instead they want adoption of technology
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:01:57.000]  forced adoption
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:01:59.000]  global social credit scores
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:01.000]  carbon taxes that dominate
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:03.000]  and monitor every facet of our lodge
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:05.000]  you make the case
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:07.000]  the new world order is
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:09.000]  but using this great reset
[3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  to really take up
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  there's whole idea of control and authoritarianism
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:15.000]  they have decided to trigger
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:17.000]  a controlled collapse
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:19.000]  and then bring in a new dark age
[3:02:19.000 --> 3:02:21.000]  to control the general public
[3:02:21.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  where they will be in their Elysium fields
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:25.000]  there is no new technology coming
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:27.000]  and they're blocking that
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:29.000]  and so really they're just imploding things
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  under the cloud pivot model
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  to show that they can get that control over us
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:35.000]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:37.000]  he has presented tons of
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:39.000]  valid evidence and facts
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  that I think have been really really important
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  to raising consciousness
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:45.000]  to what the sort of technocratic
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:47.000]  global elite really
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:49.000]  want to do
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  the true thing that you've done
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:53.000]  which is stunning
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:55.000]  if you look at the evidence of that and the facts
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  you are one of the great thinkers
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:02:59.000]  of this
[3:02:59.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  you've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:03.000]  and see that
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  this book the great reset
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  in the war for the world

[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  the people that hate Alex Jones the most have to read this book
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:13.000]  this is no beach read
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:15.000]  you're not going to be flipping pages

[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:19.000]  and you're going to be underlining stuff
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:21.000]  it's amazing
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  the great reset in the war for the world

[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:01.000]  they will push you around and make you their slave

[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:33.000]  let your chains sit
[3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:35.000]  lightly upon you

[3:04:57.000 --> 3:04:59.000]  in the void
[3:04:59.000 --> 3:05:01.000]  sliding towards collapse
[3:05:01.000 --> 3:05:03.000]  in the strange space between what we've known
[3:05:03.000 --> 3:05:05.000]  and what's to come
[3:05:05.000 --> 3:05:07.000]  and right now
[3:05:07.000 --> 3:05:09.000]  the most important thing to remember is

[3:05:17.000 --> 3:05:19.000]  course
[3:05:19.000 --> 3:05:21.000]  there is nothing stopping we the people
[3:05:21.000 --> 3:05:23.000]  from making our own rules
[3:05:23.000 --> 3:05:25.000]  and building our own society
[3:05:25.000 --> 3:05:27.000]  all we got to do is survive the crash
[3:05:27.000 --> 3:05:29.000]  and right now we still have time
[3:05:29.000 --> 3:05:31.000]  to prepare
[3:05:31.000 --> 3:05:33.000]  the world fiat currency system
[3:05:33.000 --> 3:05:35.000]  is racing towards zero
[3:05:35.000 --> 3:05:37.000]  it's time to convert it into hard assets
[3:05:37.000 --> 3:05:39.000]  now

[3:05:59.000 --> 3:06:01.000]  welcome back to info wars
[3:06:01.000 --> 3:06:03.000]  this is a alex jones show
[3:06:03.000 --> 3:06:05.000]  hosted by
[3:06:05.000 --> 3:06:07.000]  robert parnes
[3:06:07.000 --> 3:06:09.000]  more information coming out of the
[3:06:09.000 --> 3:06:11.000]  continued debacle and disaster
[3:06:11.000 --> 3:06:13.000]  that is the war in ukraine
[3:06:13.000 --> 3:06:15.000]  in this latest report
[3:06:15.000 --> 3:06:17.000]  it appears that american
[3:06:17.000 --> 3:06:19.000]  supplied weapons were used by ukraine
[3:06:19.000 --> 3:06:21.000]  to bomb
[3:06:21.000 --> 3:06:23.000]  their own prisoners
[3:06:23.000 --> 3:06:25.000]  held in russian territory
[3:06:25.000 --> 3:06:27.000]  this is a place where various members of the
[3:06:27.000 --> 3:06:29.000]  assoff battalion
[3:06:29.000 --> 3:06:31.000]  and various ukrainian soldiers were being held
[3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:33.000]  as either prisoners of war
[3:06:33.000 --> 3:06:35.000]  or in some cases prisoners under the local
[3:06:35.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  authority of the various
[3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:39.000]  donbas
[3:06:39.000 --> 3:06:41.000]  locally organized militias and governments
[3:06:41.000 --> 3:06:43.000]  that felt that some of these people had committed crimes
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:45.000]  against them leading up to the
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:47.000]  conflict well apparently
[3:06:47.000 --> 3:06:49.000]  ukraine has used
[3:06:49.000 --> 3:06:51.000]  using american provided weapons
[3:06:51.000 --> 3:06:53.000]  has bombed it and killed a bunch of them
[3:06:53.000 --> 3:06:55.000]  so there are three questions that arise
[3:06:55.000 --> 3:06:57.000]  the first question is
[3:06:57.000 --> 3:06:59.000]  was this done by accident that
[3:06:59.000 --> 3:07:01.000]  ukraine didn't know what was happening
[3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:03.000]  second was it somehow not done
[3:07:03.000 --> 3:07:05.000]  by ukraine why would russia do this
[3:07:05.000 --> 3:07:07.000]  on its own territory
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:09.000]  or territory it controls
[3:07:09.000 --> 3:07:11.000]  and third could it have been
[3:07:11.000 --> 3:07:13.000]  done deliberately by ukraine
[3:07:13.000 --> 3:07:15.000]  well the latter part can't be
[3:07:15.000 --> 3:07:17.000]  completely ruled out because of the very
[3:07:17.000 --> 3:07:19.000]  unusual politics we have
[3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:21.000]  in ukraine and the
[3:07:21.000 --> 3:07:23.000]  unusual dynamics of who
[3:07:23.000 --> 3:07:25.000]  some of those people were that were being
[3:07:25.000 --> 3:07:27.000]  held in custody
[3:07:27.000 --> 3:07:29.000]  so the assoff battalion
[3:07:29.000 --> 3:07:31.000]  dates back to a range of
[3:07:31.000 --> 3:07:33.000]  neo-nazi militias
[3:07:33.000 --> 3:07:35.000]  formed for to perpetuate
[3:07:35.000 --> 3:07:37.000]  the made on revolution in
[3:07:37.000 --> 3:07:39.000]  1914 in ukraine
[3:07:39.000 --> 3:07:41.000]  but it has an even longer heritage
[3:07:41.000 --> 3:07:43.000]  in history in fact you could
[3:07:43.000 --> 3:07:45.000]  arguably go all the way back a century
[3:07:45.000 --> 3:07:47.000]  to the 1920s so the
[3:07:47.000 --> 3:07:49.000]  land of ukraine in the language
[3:07:49.000 --> 3:07:51.000]  of russian literally means
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:53.000]  and other languages actually
[3:07:53.000 --> 3:07:55.000]  actually means just border lands
[3:07:55.000 --> 3:07:57.000]  it was always the border lands between
[3:07:57.000 --> 3:07:59.000]  competing great empires
[3:07:59.000 --> 3:08:01.000]  the russian empire the
[3:08:01.000 --> 3:08:03.000]  austro-hungarian empire
[3:08:03.000 --> 3:08:05.000]  the polish-lithuanian empire
[3:08:05.000 --> 3:08:07.000]  and so forth and occasionally
[3:08:07.000 --> 3:08:09.000]  the german empire and as well
[3:08:09.000 --> 3:08:11.000]  the ottoman-turkish empire
[3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:13.000]  so this border lands was made up
[3:08:13.000 --> 3:08:15.000]  of a wide range of people
[3:08:15.000 --> 3:08:17.000]  you had cossacks in the east
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:19.000]  you had russians in part of the
[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:21.000]  country you had ukranians in other
[3:08:21.000 --> 3:08:23.000]  parts of the country you had turks and
[3:08:23.000 --> 3:08:25.000]  greeks in odessa
[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:27.000]  in other parts along the border
[3:08:27.000 --> 3:08:29.000]  next to the black sea
[3:08:29.000 --> 3:08:31.000]  you had romanians in another part of the
[3:08:31.000 --> 3:08:33.000]  country indeed deputy premier
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:35.000]  medvedev
[3:08:35.000 --> 3:08:37.000]  the former president of russia
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:39.000]  recently put out two maps
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:41.000]  and one map had a map of what
[3:08:41.000 --> 3:08:43.000]  he thinks Zelensky thinks is going to
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:45.000]  have happen and somebody made a meme of it
[3:08:45.000 --> 3:08:47.000]  basically someone taking cocaine
[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:49.000]  and making a map of ukraine
[3:08:49.000 --> 3:08:51.000]  all the way back to being old ukraine plus
[3:08:51.000 --> 3:08:53.000]  Crimea and then he put up what
[3:08:53.000 --> 3:08:55.000]  he thinks the west wants to do with the map
[3:08:55.000 --> 3:08:57.000]  or really thinks is going to happen with the map
[3:08:57.000 --> 3:08:59.000]  and much of it was divvied up between
[3:08:59.000 --> 3:09:01.000]  poland and romania and
[3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:03.000]  hongry and then
[3:09:03.000 --> 3:09:05.000]  russia and then just a little bit
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:07.000]  around Kiev that would actually be
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:09.000]  ukraine that
[3:09:09.000 --> 3:09:11.000]  history reflects a long history that's
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:13.000]  unique to ukraine but as it relates
[3:09:13.000 --> 3:09:15.000]  to the potential for this
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:17.000]  to have been a deliberate attack by ukrainian
[3:09:17.000 --> 3:09:19.000]  military officials on their
[3:09:19.000 --> 3:09:21.000]  own
[3:09:21.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  army members and particularly
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:25.000]  assoc battalion members being held
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:27.000]  prisoner in russia that they might
[3:09:27.000 --> 3:09:29.000]  have had information that they
[3:09:29.000 --> 3:09:31.000]  didn't want publicly exposed remember
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:33.000]  the assoc battalion was holding out for a
[3:09:33.000 --> 3:09:35.000]  long time in mario poll
[3:09:35.000 --> 3:09:37.000]  under that factory
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:39.000]  even without basic food and medicine
[3:09:39.000 --> 3:09:41.000]  until they find and there are multiple
[3:09:41.000 --> 3:09:43.000]  ridiculously desperate efforts
[3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:45.000]  to help people escape from there
[3:09:45.000 --> 3:09:47.000]  including helicopters that would go in
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:49.000]  and get shot down other attempts that would
[3:09:49.000 --> 3:09:51.000]  completely fail efforts by sea that
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:53.000]  would fail so there was clearly
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:09:55.000]  an obsession so much so that many
[3:09:55.000 --> 3:09:57.000]  people speculated that maybe
[3:09:57.000 --> 3:09:59.000]  what is in there is some prominent
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:01.000]  french or other general or british
[3:10:01.000 --> 3:10:03.000]  or american general maybe down there
[3:10:03.000 --> 3:10:05.000]  that did not turn out to be the case so the
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:07.000]  question is what was it they wanted to hide
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:09.000]  to keep those assoc battalion
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:11.000]  members from surrendering
[3:10:11.000 --> 3:10:13.000]  well then they did ultimately surrender
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:15.000]  they pretended it was like a retreat
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:17.000]  or something but they surrendered
[3:10:17.000 --> 3:10:19.000]  unconditionally and then they were
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  ultimately are going to be going
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:23.000]  on trial or maybe
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:25.000]  sent back to ukraine in a prisoner
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:27.000]  swap so why would they
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:29.000]  might want to kill their own
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:31.000]  assoc battalion members and
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:33.000]  soldiers now that they're in russian
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:35.000]  captivity what might they know that
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:37.000]  might be a problem well this goes
[3:10:37.000 --> 3:10:39.000]  all the way back to the long history of the
[3:10:39.000 --> 3:10:41.000]  rise of fascism within the western
[3:10:41.000 --> 3:10:43.000]  ukrainian
[3:10:43.000 --> 3:10:45.000]  ultranationalism that began in the
[3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:47.000]  late teens and in the early 20s that was
[3:10:47.000 --> 3:10:49.000]  a different brand of ukrainian nationalism
[3:10:49.000 --> 3:10:51.000]  that existed in the eastern and central
[3:10:51.000 --> 3:10:53.000]  parts of the country it was in fact
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:55.000]  many people in the central and eastern
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:10:57.000]  part of ukraine wanted nothing to do
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:10:59.000]  with this ultranationalistic
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:01.000]  quasi-fascistic
[3:11:01.000 --> 3:11:03.000]  mechanism that was being
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:05.000]  promoted by the ultranationalist
[3:11:05.000 --> 3:11:07.000]  under steppan bendera
[3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:09.000]  and others they would
[3:11:09.000 --> 3:11:11.000]  go in the 1920s they would wage
[3:11:11.000 --> 3:11:13.000]  mostly war against the poles
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:15.000]  who had disparate influence in that part
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:17.000]  of ukraine try to assassinate
[3:11:17.000 --> 3:11:19.000]  and successfully kill various bolish
[3:11:19.000 --> 3:11:21.000]  leaders leading to the arrest of steppan
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:23.000]  bendera and others
[3:11:23.000 --> 3:11:25.000]  and that and then ultimately bendera would
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:27.000]  be released by the nazis when the nazis
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:29.000]  went into ukraine and the
[3:11:29.000 --> 3:11:31.000]  ukrainian ultranationalist of the bendera
[3:11:31.000 --> 3:11:33.000]  or the bendera rights as they're
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:35.000]  called ultimately aligned with the
[3:11:35.000 --> 3:11:37.000]  nazis and committed some of the most
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:39.000]  horrific violations
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:41.000]  of human rights and basic liberty that
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:43.000]  could be imagined in world war two
[3:11:43.000 --> 3:11:45.000]  to give you an idea of how bad it was
[3:11:45.000 --> 3:11:47.000]  even the nazis thought it was
[3:11:47.000 --> 3:11:49.000]  horrendous the nazis were like that's
[3:11:49.000 --> 3:11:51.000]  a little too far if it goes
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:53.000]  a little too far for the nazis maybe
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:11:55.000]  you've gone a little too far
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:11:57.000]  that was the nature of the banderite divisions
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:11:59.000]  after the end of world war two
[3:11:59.000 --> 3:12:01.000]  the CIA recruited
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:03.000]  steppan bendera the CIA
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:05.000]  recruited many of the neo-nazis
[3:12:05.000 --> 3:12:07.000]  the CIA actually recruited actual
[3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:09.000]  nazis created a spy
[3:12:09.000 --> 3:12:11.000]  network in central and eastern europe that
[3:12:11.000 --> 3:12:13.000]  was made up of ex-nazis
[3:12:13.000 --> 3:12:15.000]  so nazis or fascist or their allies
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:17.000]  were a critical part
[3:12:17.000 --> 3:12:19.000]  of what was going on with the CIA
[3:12:19.000 --> 3:12:21.000]  in europe they had a whole
[3:12:21.000 --> 3:12:23.000]  group that they left behind to try to be
[3:12:23.000 --> 3:12:25.000]  able to create ideal theoretically
[3:12:25.000 --> 3:12:27.000]  to defend against the russian and
[3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:29.000]  soviet invasion but in fact
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:31.000]  to actually promote destabilization
[3:12:31.000 --> 3:12:33.000]  regimes they didn't like this happened
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:35.000]  in a range of countries there were specific
[3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:37.000]  names of operations given to this
[3:12:37.000 --> 3:12:39.000]  blew up in different places in
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:41.000]  Italy in the early 1980s with a wide
[3:12:41.000 --> 3:12:43.000]  range of scandals connected to it
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:45.000]  but the part of that group
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:47.000]  was the ultra-nationalist neo-nazis
[3:12:47.000 --> 3:12:49.000]  of western Ukraine
[3:12:49.000 --> 3:12:51.000]  so soviet union collapses
[3:12:51.000 --> 3:12:53.000]  what does the west do?
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:12:55.000]  it re-engages that same group
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:12:57.000]  indeed the principal propagandist
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:12:59.000]  for some of the ideas now believed by
[3:12:59.000 --> 3:13:01.000]  all kinds of Ukrainian nationalists
[3:13:01.000 --> 3:13:03.000]  were actually propagated by harvard
[3:13:03.000 --> 3:13:05.000]  and other institutions in the west
[3:13:05.000 --> 3:13:07.000]  associated with this ultra-nationalist
[3:13:07.000 --> 3:13:09.000]  fascistic neo-nazi regime
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:11.000]  including the myth
[3:13:11.000 --> 3:13:13.000]  of the soviet famine
[3:13:13.000 --> 3:13:15.000]  was designed to target Ukrainians
[3:13:15.000 --> 3:13:17.000]  by ethnicity utterly false
[3:13:17.000 --> 3:13:19.000]  the famines that took place under Stalin
[3:13:19.000 --> 3:13:21.000]  in fact there were famines that took place under Lenin
[3:13:21.000 --> 3:13:23.000]  were a combination of
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:25.000]  incompetency and an attempt to
[3:13:25.000 --> 3:13:27.000]  attack independent peasant farmers
[3:13:27.000 --> 3:13:29.000]  and the primary targets were Cossacks
[3:13:29.000 --> 3:13:31.000]  and Kulaks not
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:33.000]  Ukrainians by ethnicity in fact more died
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:35.000]  on a per capita basis outside of Ukraine
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:37.000]  than died in Ukraine the great journalist
[3:13:37.000 --> 3:13:39.000]  who covered this who was
[3:13:39.000 --> 3:13:41.000]  exposing the fraud that the New York Times
[3:13:41.000 --> 3:13:43.000]  was at the time never made it specific
[3:13:43.000 --> 3:13:45.000]  to Ukraine and made it clear
[3:13:45.000 --> 3:13:47.000]  it was across southern Russia
[3:13:47.000 --> 3:13:49.000]  the black belt weak growing regions
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:51.000]  of Russia as well as
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:53.000]  what is part of Ukraine and it wasn't even
[3:13:53.000 --> 3:13:55.000]  very strong in the far western part of Ukraine
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:57.000]  which is not the bread basket of Ukraine anyway
[3:13:57.000 --> 3:13:59.000]  so but that mythology was built
[3:13:59.000 --> 3:14:01.000]  by the CIA allied groups
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:03.000]  and associates and institutions here in the west
[3:14:03.000 --> 3:14:05.000]  so we re-engage them
[3:14:05.000 --> 3:14:07.000]  in the early 90s went into bed
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:09.000]  with them to help create the first
[3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:11.000]  color revolution in 2004
[3:14:11.000 --> 3:14:13.000]  and when we got nervous that we needed
[3:14:13.000 --> 3:14:15.000]  better allies George Soros
[3:14:15.000 --> 3:14:17.000]  as he did when he was a kid
[3:14:17.000 --> 3:14:19.000]  along with the CIA and other
[3:14:19.000 --> 3:14:21.000]  MI6 and other western intelligence agencies
[3:14:21.000 --> 3:14:23.000]  and aligned groups got together
[3:14:23.000 --> 3:14:25.000]  and help back and propagate
[3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:27.000]  and support a rising
[3:14:27.000 --> 3:14:29.000]  neo-nazi militia group
[3:14:29.000 --> 3:14:31.000]  often recruiting from prisons
[3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:33.000]  and recruiting hooligans from various
[3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:35.000]  soccer games and other
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:37.000]  mob related groups that's
[3:14:37.000 --> 3:14:39.000]  who created the ass off battalion
[3:14:39.000 --> 3:14:41.000]  in 2014 with the aid
[3:14:41.000 --> 3:14:43.000]  of critical
[3:14:43.000 --> 3:14:45.000]  oligarchs in Ukraine
[3:14:45.000 --> 3:14:47.000]  to promote and
[3:14:47.000 --> 3:14:49.000]  propagate the western
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:51.000]  agenda in Ukraine using
[3:14:51.000 --> 3:14:53.000]  Crane as a de facto colony
[3:14:53.000 --> 3:14:55.000]  to engage in bioweapon experimentation
[3:14:55.000 --> 3:14:57.000]  and the destabilization of Russia
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:14:59.000]  because the globalists hate
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:01.000]  Russia because of their independence
[3:15:01.000 --> 3:15:03.000]  because of Putin's unwillingness
[3:15:03.000 --> 3:15:05.000]  to engage in woke globalism
[3:15:05.000 --> 3:15:07.000]  and his dislike of it
[3:15:07.000 --> 3:15:09.000]  at a fundamental and core level
[3:15:09.000 --> 3:15:11.000]  Soros has hated Putin since
[3:15:11.000 --> 3:15:13.000]  for as long as anyone can remember
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:15.000]  he hates Putin even more than he hates Trump
[3:15:15.000 --> 3:15:17.000]  so the problem is somebody in that
[3:15:17.000 --> 3:15:19.000]  group that may have been in that prison
[3:15:19.000 --> 3:15:21.000]  and it may have just been one or two
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:23.000]  but there's no better way to take somebody out
[3:15:23.000 --> 3:15:25.000]  than to take out a whole bunch of people to disguise what you're up to
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:27.000]  so this accidental bombing
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:29.000]  by Ukraine of their
[3:15:29.000 --> 3:15:31.000]  own soldiers in the ass off battalion
[3:15:31.000 --> 3:15:33.000]  held in a prison
[3:15:33.000 --> 3:15:35.000]  on Russian occupied territory
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:37.000]  we can't rule out the possibility
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:39.000]  it was actually intentional
[3:15:39.000 --> 3:15:41.000]  and deliberate
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:43.000]  when we come back
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:45.000]  we're going to be discussing more
[3:15:45.000 --> 3:15:47.000]  vaccine deaths that keep happening
[3:15:47.000 --> 3:15:49.000]  or appear to be vaccine deaths
[3:15:49.000 --> 3:15:51.000]  for superstars and celebrities
[3:15:51.000 --> 3:16:11.000]  around the world
[3:16:33.000 --> 3:16:35.000]  we wouldn't even be here
[3:16:35.000 --> 3:16:37.000]  if I hadn't gotten great tax advice

[3:20:09.000 --> 3:20:11.000]  welcome back to the alex jones show
[3:20:11.000 --> 3:20:13.000]  this is robert barnes guest hosting
[3:20:13.000 --> 3:20:15.000]  here in the fourth hour
[3:20:15.000 --> 3:20:17.000]  what is fascinating to me in watching aspects
[3:20:17.000 --> 3:20:19.000]  of the trial and it's part of being a broad
[3:20:19.000 --> 3:20:21.000]  based conversation over the years
[3:20:21.000 --> 3:20:23.000]  is the way in which info wars is demonized
[3:20:23.000 --> 3:20:25.000]  for providing its own independent products
[3:20:25.000 --> 3:20:27.000]  rather than hawking other people's
[3:20:27.000 --> 3:20:29.000]  products or whoring for big pharma
[3:20:29.000 --> 3:20:31.000]  in corporate america
[3:20:31.000 --> 3:20:33.000]  I've always found that fascinating
[3:20:33.000 --> 3:20:35.000]  through almost every other media network
[3:20:35.000 --> 3:20:37.000]  and content creator out there
[3:20:37.000 --> 3:20:39.000]  that gets any form of advertising
[3:20:39.000 --> 3:20:41.000]  in order to be able to stay on the air
[3:20:41.000 --> 3:20:43.000]  to do the time
[3:20:43.000 --> 3:20:45.000]  and to have the investment capital necessary
[3:20:45.000 --> 3:20:47.000]  to produce quality content
[3:20:47.000 --> 3:20:49.000]  for people to witness and see
[3:20:49.000 --> 3:20:51.000]  and to be
[3:20:51.000 --> 3:20:53.000]  involved in on a participatory level
[3:20:53.000 --> 3:20:55.000]  involves, requires at some level money from something
[3:20:55.000 --> 3:20:57.000]  and the most common sources
[3:20:57.000 --> 3:20:59.000]  like fox news, cnn, mainstream media
[3:20:59.000 --> 3:21:01.000]  the new york times, etc
[3:21:01.000 --> 3:21:03.000]  comes from corporate advertisers
[3:21:03.000 --> 3:21:05.000]  so your average content creator
[3:21:05.000 --> 3:21:07.000]  your average so-called respectable
[3:21:07.000 --> 3:21:09.000]  journalist is out there
[3:21:09.000 --> 3:21:11.000]  promoting a product that they've
[3:21:11.000 --> 3:21:13.000]  never vetted
[3:21:13.000 --> 3:21:15.000]  that they can't conscientiously
[3:21:15.000 --> 3:21:17.000]  leave out for
[3:21:17.000 --> 3:21:19.000]  no idea if it's better for people
[3:21:19.000 --> 3:21:21.000]  they don't know if it makes the world
[3:21:21.000 --> 3:21:23.000]  a better place or a worse place
[3:21:23.000 --> 3:21:25.000]  they don't know if it's good for people or bad for people
[3:21:25.000 --> 3:21:27.000]  they are often caught marketing
[3:21:27.000 --> 3:21:29.000]  promoting pitching being sponsored by
[3:21:29.000 --> 3:21:31.000]  companies that have
[3:21:31.000 --> 3:21:33.000]  are not promoting good products
[3:21:33.000 --> 3:21:35.000]  that products that either cost too much or part of a scam
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:37.000]  cause injury, cause harm, etc
[3:21:37.000 --> 3:21:39.000]  one could think no further
[3:21:39.000 --> 3:21:41.000]  than the covid-19 vaccines
[3:21:41.000 --> 3:21:43.000]  as a product that has turned out that way
[3:21:43.000 --> 3:21:45.000]  and they've hawked that directly and personally on the air
[3:21:45.000 --> 3:21:47.000]  almost across the media spectrum
[3:21:47.000 --> 3:21:49.000]  by contrast
[3:21:49.000 --> 3:21:51.000]  what alex jones chose to do
[3:21:51.000 --> 3:21:53.000]  is to promote only products
[3:21:53.000 --> 3:21:55.000]  that he can personally vet
[3:21:55.000 --> 3:21:57.000]  that he can personally and conscientiously
[3:21:57.000 --> 3:21:59.000]  vouch for
[3:21:59.000 --> 3:22:01.000]  and that he has every reason to believe
[3:22:01.000 --> 3:22:03.000]  from his own lived experience
[3:22:03.000 --> 3:22:05.000]  will be better for the people
[3:22:05.000 --> 3:22:07.000]  who consume it making people healthier
[3:22:07.000 --> 3:22:09.000]  wealthier and wiser in the process
[3:22:09.000 --> 3:22:11.000]  that has struck me as always
[3:22:11.000 --> 3:22:13.000]  a much more rational
[3:22:13.000 --> 3:22:15.000]  and just means of supporting
[3:22:15.000 --> 3:22:17.000]  an independent content creator
[3:22:17.000 --> 3:22:19.000]  than cowering
[3:22:19.000 --> 3:22:21.000]  to big pharma
[3:22:21.000 --> 3:22:23.000]  and big corporate america
[3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:25.000]  the other big big big difference of course
[3:22:25.000 --> 3:22:27.000]  and the real reason it drives them nuts
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:29.000]  they're not really concerned about
[3:22:29.000 --> 3:22:31.000]  independent natural health
[3:22:31.000 --> 3:22:33.000]  though there was an implication in the courtroom yesterday
[3:22:33.000 --> 3:22:35.000]  that supplements are inherently
[3:22:35.000 --> 3:22:37.000]  bad, that they're untrustworthy
[3:22:37.000 --> 3:22:39.000]  cause those are not FDA licensed products
[3:22:39.000 --> 3:22:41.000]  and by the way
[3:22:41.000 --> 3:22:43.000]  as history the FDA started out
[3:22:43.000 --> 3:22:45.000]  as a marketing organization
[3:22:45.000 --> 3:22:47.000]  they were not supposed to be a medicine organization
[3:22:47.000 --> 3:22:49.000]  they were not supposed
[3:22:49.000 --> 3:22:51.000]  to be a scientific organization
[3:22:51.000 --> 3:22:53.000]  they were supposed to make sure
[3:22:53.000 --> 3:22:55.000]  that the labels on the product
[3:22:55.000 --> 3:22:57.000]  match what is actually in the product
[3:22:57.000 --> 3:22:59.000]  in other words that
[3:22:59.000 --> 3:23:01.000]  if you bought kidney beans
[3:23:01.000 --> 3:23:03.000]  you got kidney beans not pinto beans
[3:23:03.000 --> 3:23:05.000]  and so on and so forth
[3:23:05.000 --> 3:23:07.000]  because in the late 1800s
[3:23:07.000 --> 3:23:09.000]  there were people committing overt fraud
[3:23:09.000 --> 3:23:11.000]  on the outside of the can
[3:23:11.000 --> 3:23:13.000]  on the outside of the can
[3:23:13.000 --> 3:23:15.000]  but that was their sole and whole objective
[3:23:15.000 --> 3:23:17.000]  they've gone way past that
[3:23:17.000 --> 3:23:19.000]  over the years as many of us said
[3:23:19.000 --> 3:23:21.000]  they would because that's the nature of power
[3:23:21.000 --> 3:23:23.000]  power continually corrupts
[3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:25.000]  the use and application of that power
[3:23:25.000 --> 3:23:27.000]  but here the other big difference
[3:23:27.000 --> 3:23:29.000]  what really drives them nuts
[3:23:29.000 --> 3:23:31.000]  about info wars
[3:23:31.000 --> 3:23:33.000]  independent financing model is just that
[3:23:33.000 --> 3:23:35.000]  it's not that it's natural health supplements
[3:23:35.000 --> 3:23:37.000]  so much it's not that it's
[3:23:37.000 --> 3:23:39.000]  big corporate america and it's not big pharma
[3:23:39.000 --> 3:23:41.000]  and it's not any of that
[3:23:41.000 --> 3:23:43.000]  it's that it's not a controlled
[3:23:43.000 --> 3:23:45.000]  narrative it's not a censored
[3:23:45.000 --> 3:23:47.000]  messenger a censored
[3:23:47.000 --> 3:23:49.000]  sponsor that
[3:23:49.000 --> 3:23:51.000]  if you're taking money from anybody else
[3:23:51.000 --> 3:23:53.000]  some big sugar daddy donor
[3:23:53.000 --> 3:23:55.000]  some big corporate america advertiser
[3:23:55.000 --> 3:23:57.000]  some big pharma solicitor
[3:23:57.000 --> 3:23:59.000]  then you cannot be
[3:23:59.000 --> 3:24:01.000]  open honest and uncensored
[3:24:01.000 --> 3:24:03.000]  at what you believe and what you think
[3:24:03.000 --> 3:24:05.000]  and what you say you're going to self
[3:24:05.000 --> 3:24:07.000]  censor and consequently
[3:24:07.000 --> 3:24:09.000]  you're not going to meaningfully
[3:24:09.000 --> 3:24:11.000]  communicate content
[3:24:11.000 --> 3:24:13.000]  information that people want this happens
[3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:15.000]  in the law all the time an ordinary person
[3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:17.000]  will often hear a lawyer say something about
[3:24:17.000 --> 3:24:19.000]  a court a judicial process
[3:24:19.000 --> 3:24:21.000]  a government officer or prosecutor
[3:24:21.000 --> 3:24:23.000]  that they will be scared to say in public
[3:24:23.000 --> 3:24:25.000]  and on the press because they fear
[3:24:25.000 --> 3:24:27.000]  blowback from those within
[3:24:27.000 --> 3:24:29.000]  positions of power the same
[3:24:29.000 --> 3:24:31.000]  is true of those who are controlled
[3:24:31.000 --> 3:24:33.000]  by a donor I'll give an example
[3:24:33.000 --> 3:24:35.000]  Black Rifle Coffee Company
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:37.000]  there's a lot of people that will continue
[3:24:37.000 --> 3:24:39.000]  to hawk Black Rifle Coffee Company
[3:24:39.000 --> 3:24:41.000]  even though it's a company that threw
[3:24:41.000 --> 3:24:43.000]  Kyle Rittenhouse under the bus
[3:24:43.000 --> 3:24:45.000]  at a critical juncture while they were trying
[3:24:45.000 --> 3:24:47.000]  to be woke for the New York Times
[3:24:47.000 --> 3:24:49.000]  they're not a company that deserve
[3:24:49.000 --> 3:24:51.000]  support and yet you'll see them on
[3:24:51.000 --> 3:24:53.000]  big mainstream media conservative
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:55.000]  mainstream media being promoted
[3:24:55.000 --> 3:24:57.000]  and propagandized as such
[3:24:57.000 --> 3:24:59.000]  why because those people have to pimp
[3:24:59.000 --> 3:25:01.000]  themselves out for their advertisers
[3:25:01.000 --> 3:25:03.000]  because they refuse to create independent
[3:25:03.000 --> 3:25:05.000]  products of independent value
[3:25:05.000 --> 3:25:07.000]  that allows an independent narrative
[3:25:07.000 --> 3:25:09.000]  to be communicated to the world
[3:25:09.000 --> 3:25:11.000]  that's what really drives them crazy
[3:25:11.000 --> 3:25:13.000]  about the info wars model
[3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:15.000]  it is a purely populist model
[3:25:15.000 --> 3:25:17.000]  from top to bottom
[3:25:17.000 --> 3:25:19.000]  it is a model that empowers
[3:25:19.000 --> 3:25:21.000]  the messenger
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:23.000]  and thereby empowers the audience
[3:25:23.000 --> 3:25:25.000]  but it does so
[3:25:25.000 --> 3:25:27.000]  by empowering them in the process
[3:25:27.000 --> 3:25:29.000]  of the products it creates
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:31.000]  the products it sells and the products
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:33.000]  it's able to produce for its audience
[3:25:33.000 --> 3:25:35.000]  and of course if the product
[3:25:35.000 --> 3:25:37.000]  didn't work, if people didn't like it
[3:25:37.000 --> 3:25:39.000]  if it didn't meet their standards
[3:25:39.000 --> 3:25:41.000]  that product would be gone
[3:25:41.000 --> 3:25:43.000]  because nobody's buying something that doesn't work
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:45.000]  and isn't effective and isn't what they want
[3:25:45.000 --> 3:25:47.000]  and so that becomes an ultimate check
[3:25:47.000 --> 3:25:49.000]  basically the audience becomes
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:51.000]  the only one to govern
[3:25:51.000 --> 3:25:53.000]  what content is created
[3:25:53.000 --> 3:25:55.000]  and is available on info wars
[3:25:55.000 --> 3:25:57.000]  by choosing to support it at infowarstore.com
[3:25:57.000 --> 3:25:59.000]  by continuing to buy the products they like
[3:25:59.000 --> 3:26:01.000]  and if they don't like the product
[3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:03.000]  they let info wars know
[3:26:03.000 --> 3:26:05.000]  by not buying it or saying so in the reviews
[3:26:05.000 --> 3:26:07.000]  and that's the process
[3:26:07.000 --> 3:26:09.000]  it's a purely populist process
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:11.000]  it's a deep American process
[3:26:11.000 --> 3:26:13.000]  it's probably the most populist press structure
[3:26:13.000 --> 3:26:15.000]  in the history of America
[3:26:15.000 --> 3:26:17.000]  arguably the history of the world
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:19.000]  because who has the power base
[3:26:19.000 --> 3:26:21.000]  what is populism? it's giving power to the people
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:23.000]  as Abraham Lincoln said
[3:26:23.000 --> 3:26:25.000]  we are supposed to be a government
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:27.000]  of the people
[3:26:27.000 --> 3:26:29.000]  by the people and for the people
[3:26:29.000 --> 3:26:31.000]  what info wars has done
[3:26:31.000 --> 3:26:33.000]  is made an entire media network
[3:26:33.000 --> 3:26:35.000]  of the people
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:37.000]  by the people and for the people
[3:26:37.000 --> 3:26:39.000]  you govern it at every single level
[3:26:39.000 --> 3:26:41.000]  you govern it
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:43.000]  and it's ability to put on content
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:45.000]  you govern it on the quality of the products it creates
[3:26:45.000 --> 3:26:47.000]  and whether it meets up to your measurements
[3:26:47.000 --> 3:26:49.000]  and expectations
[3:26:49.000 --> 3:26:51.000]  you govern it's ability to communicate
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:53.000]  to the globe the independent information
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:26:55.000]  often
[3:26:55.000 --> 3:26:57.000]  either only available here
[3:26:57.000 --> 3:26:59.000]  or definitely first available here
[3:26:59.000 --> 3:27:01.000]  after all, let's go back to the COVID lockdown
[3:27:01.000 --> 3:27:03.000]  who was the first person
[3:27:03.000 --> 3:27:05.000]  talking about
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:07.000]  Bill Gates
[3:27:07.000 --> 3:27:09.000]  in the context of public health policy
[3:27:09.000 --> 3:27:11.000]  talking about Bill Gates
[3:27:11.000 --> 3:27:13.000]  in the context of what may be coming
[3:27:13.000 --> 3:27:15.000]  with COVID-19
[3:27:15.000 --> 3:27:17.000]  all the way back in January
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:19.000]  and early February of 2020
[3:27:19.000 --> 3:27:21.000]  in fact at the time I remember
[3:27:21.000 --> 3:27:23.000]  people saying oh, the eldest criticism
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:25.000]  of Bill Gates doesn't make any sense
[3:27:25.000 --> 3:27:27.000]  this is a wonderful philanthropist
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:29.000]  a man who just loves to give to the world
[3:27:29.000 --> 3:27:31.000]  ignoring the fact that
[3:27:31.000 --> 3:27:33.000]  I remember when he was one of the most hated people
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:35.000]  in all of corporate America
[3:27:35.000 --> 3:27:37.000]  and all of ordinary America
[3:27:37.000 --> 3:27:39.000]  and all of tech America
[3:27:39.000 --> 3:27:41.000]  because of his scheming and monopolistic
[3:27:41.000 --> 3:27:43.000]  tactics and illicit behaviors
[3:27:43.000 --> 3:27:45.000]  while at Microsoft
[3:27:45.000 --> 3:27:47.000]  there's a reason why he got not one
[3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:49.000]  but two and maybe even three pies in the face
[3:27:49.000 --> 3:27:51.000]  I remember the Bill Gates
[3:27:51.000 --> 3:27:53.000]  and Bill Gates father
[3:27:53.000 --> 3:27:55.000]  and Bill Gates grandfather
[3:27:55.000 --> 3:27:57.000]  who were involved in the eugenics movement
[3:27:57.000 --> 3:27:59.000]  or other organizations like Planned Parenthood
[3:27:59.000 --> 3:28:01.000]  who promoted and propagated
[3:28:01.000 --> 3:28:03.000]  the eugenics movement from its inception
[3:28:03.000 --> 3:28:05.000]  an idea that we should control
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:07.000]  the population so only a small
[3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:09.000]  privileged group of people can have
[3:28:09.000 --> 3:28:11.000]  a disparate amount of resources
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:13.000]  that's in the end what eugenics became
[3:28:13.000 --> 3:28:15.000]  and I knew that was part of Bill Gates agenda
[3:28:15.000 --> 3:28:17.000]  but the only person talking about it
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:19.000]  with any degree of substantial
[3:28:19.000 --> 3:28:21.000]  scale of an audience
[3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:23.000]  was once again InfoWars
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:25.000]  and why is that? Because InfoWars isn't
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:27.000]  dependent upon Big Pharma
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:29.000]  because InfoWars isn't dependent on corporate advertisers
[3:28:29.000 --> 3:28:31.000]  because InfoWars ain't dependent on a sugar daddy
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:33.000]  InfoWars is only dependent on you
[3:28:33.000 --> 3:28:35.000]  you are the front line

[3:33:19.000 --> 3:33:21.000]  and stars and sports players
[3:33:21.000 --> 3:33:23.000]  around the globe
[3:33:23.000 --> 3:33:25.000]  but next, Shakira finds
[3:33:25.000 --> 3:33:27.000]  herself facing potential
[3:33:27.000 --> 3:33:29.000]  years in prison over alleged
[3:33:29.000 --> 3:33:31.000]  tax fraud in the
[3:33:31.000 --> 3:33:33.000]  case pending apparently in spain
[3:33:33.000 --> 3:33:35.000]  tax cases have often been
[3:33:35.000 --> 3:33:37.000]  utilized to target
[3:33:37.000 --> 3:33:39.000]  political dissidents and other
[3:33:39.000 --> 3:33:41.000]  outsiders indeed most countries
[3:33:41.000 --> 3:33:43.000]  in the world no longer imprison people
[3:33:43.000 --> 3:33:45.000]  for tax issues
[3:33:45.000 --> 3:33:47.000]  but in America we have two major restraints
[3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:49.000]  on tax charges
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:33:51.000]  those are the good faith defense
[3:33:51.000 --> 3:33:53.000]  and the reliance defense that are unique
[3:33:53.000 --> 3:33:55.000]  to criminal tax law in general
[3:33:55.000 --> 3:33:57.000]  why do we have this?
[3:33:57.000 --> 3:33:59.000]  well because we don't want people sent to prison
[3:33:59.000 --> 3:34:01.000]  for simply owing a debt
[3:34:01.000 --> 3:34:03.000]  nor do we want people sent to prison
[3:34:03.000 --> 3:34:05.000]  for simple disagreement with the government
[3:34:05.000 --> 3:34:07.000]  so as long as you have in fact
[3:34:07.000 --> 3:34:09.000]  a legitimate belief that what you were doing
[3:34:09.000 --> 3:34:11.000]  was lawful, a good faith belief
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:13.000]  then you can be found not guilty
[3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:15.000]  and that may have been incorrect
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:17.000]  even if they think your belief
[3:34:17.000 --> 3:34:19.000]  the IRS and the courts think your belief is crazy
[3:34:19.000 --> 3:34:21.000]  that doesn't matter, all that matters
[3:34:21.000 --> 3:34:23.000]  is that you sincerely believe it
[3:34:23.000 --> 3:34:25.000]  also a reliance defense
[3:34:25.000 --> 3:34:27.000]  which is a defense upon
[3:34:27.000 --> 3:34:29.000]  by advice with attorneys
[3:34:29.000 --> 3:34:31.000]  accountants or other professionals
[3:34:31.000 --> 3:34:33.000]  and consequently that's another grounds
[3:34:33.000 --> 3:34:35.000]  by which you can justifiably get
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:37.000]  acquitted of any tax charge
[3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:39.000]  because again we don't want disagreement
[3:34:39.000 --> 3:34:41.000]  about the law
[3:34:41.000 --> 3:34:43.000]  but generally unless of course you're Steve Bannon
[3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:45.000]  and then we carve out an exception
[3:34:45.000 --> 3:34:47.000]  much as the Travis County
[3:34:47.000 --> 3:34:49.000]  Texas Court is carving out an exception
[3:34:49.000 --> 3:34:51.000]  in the defamation cases proceeding
[3:34:51.000 --> 3:34:53.000]  with him, indeed there was an article today
[3:34:53.000 --> 3:34:55.000]  in the Texas Monthly that suggested
[3:34:55.000 --> 3:34:57.000]  that Alex Jones had foregone
[3:34:57.000 --> 3:34:59.000]  a First Amendment defense
[3:34:59.000 --> 3:35:01.000]  that's completely and utterly false
[3:35:01.000 --> 3:35:03.000]  this is another journalist who cannot take
[3:35:03.000 --> 3:35:05.000]  the time to actually
[3:35:05.000 --> 3:35:07.000]  read the cases
[3:35:07.000 --> 3:35:09.000]  and read what the Texas Court of Appeals said in this case
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:11.000]  or the Texas Court of Appeals said
[3:35:11.000 --> 3:35:13.000]  to give people a full understanding
[3:35:13.000 --> 3:35:15.000]  of what's happening here
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:17.000]  aside from the due process violations
[3:35:17.000 --> 3:35:19.000]  privacy violations, jury trial
[3:35:19.000 --> 3:35:21.000]  right violations, right to confront
[3:35:21.000 --> 3:35:23.000]  accusers, all of that
[3:35:23.000 --> 3:35:25.000]  the other violations that are occurring here
[3:35:25.000 --> 3:35:27.000]  go to the core of First Amendment protection
[3:35:27.000 --> 3:35:29.000]  the theory is this
[3:35:29.000 --> 3:35:31.000]  let's say you articulate
[3:35:31.000 --> 3:35:33.000]  an idea that is
[3:35:33.000 --> 3:35:35.000]  different than what the government believes
[3:35:35.000 --> 3:35:37.000]  the government calls it false
[3:35:37.000 --> 3:35:39.000]  and you can now be accused of misinformation
[3:35:39.000 --> 3:35:41.000]  whether or not it is in fact misinformation
[3:35:41.000 --> 3:35:43.000]  is secondary
[3:35:43.000 --> 3:35:45.000]  all that matters is you said something
[3:35:45.000 --> 3:35:47.000]  the government doesn't agree with
[3:35:47.000 --> 3:35:49.000]  that's part one, part two
[3:35:49.000 --> 3:35:51.000]  you persuade any group of people out there
[3:35:51.000 --> 3:35:53.000]  that your
[3:35:53.000 --> 3:35:55.000]  questions are legitimate questions
[3:35:55.000 --> 3:35:57.000]  and they have questions as well
[3:35:57.000 --> 3:35:59.000]  part three, somebody who feels upset
[3:35:59.000 --> 3:36:01.000]  or offended by your viewpoints
[3:36:01.000 --> 3:36:03.000]  emotionally distressed
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:05.000]  or anguished by your viewpoints
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:07.000]  can now sue you
[3:36:07.000 --> 3:36:09.000]  based on however many people ever heard
[3:36:09.000 --> 3:36:11.000]  your ideas in the first place and believe them now
[3:36:11.000 --> 3:36:13.000]  that is the core of the case
[3:36:13.000 --> 3:36:15.000]  it doesn't require you to say
[3:36:15.000 --> 3:36:17.000]  a specifically false fact
[3:36:17.000 --> 3:36:19.000]  about a specific person
[3:36:19.000 --> 3:36:21.000]  it doesn't even require you to identify
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:23.000]  anybody at all by name
[3:36:23.000 --> 3:36:25.000]  what the Texas Court of Appeals said
[3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:27.000]  was that if someone
[3:36:27.000 --> 3:36:29.000]  could look them up on the internet
[3:36:29.000 --> 3:36:31.000]  and possibly find them
[3:36:31.000 --> 3:36:33.000]  then the statement concerns them
[3:36:33.000 --> 3:36:35.000]  merely because it concerns a topic
[3:36:35.000 --> 3:36:37.000]  that they have an interest in
[3:36:37.000 --> 3:36:39.000]  that's how extraordinary
[3:36:39.000 --> 3:36:41.000]  and extreme this was
[3:36:41.000 --> 3:36:43.000]  indeed, of all the people that purportedly believe
[3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:45.000]  certain things about Sandy Hook
[3:36:45.000 --> 3:36:47.000]  how many of those people even knew
[3:36:47.000 --> 3:36:49.000]  the names of any of the people
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:51.000]  that are now suing Alex Jones
[3:36:51.000 --> 3:36:53.000]  because Alex Jones isn't the one who ever called him by name ever
[3:36:53.000 --> 3:36:55.000]  so what that's the
[3:36:55.000 --> 3:36:57.000]  the first amendment has been at the forefront
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:36:59.000]  of this case
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:01.000]  it has been litigated repeatedly
[3:37:01.000 --> 3:37:03.000]  and served in the record
[3:37:03.000 --> 3:37:05.000]  these are journalists trying to pretend
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:07.000]  that what's happening to Alex Jones
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:09.000]  couldn't possibly happen to them
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:11.000]  and what they're really relying upon
[3:37:11.000 --> 3:37:13.000]  is political power
[3:37:13.000 --> 3:37:15.000]  brokers being the gatekeepers
[3:37:15.000 --> 3:37:17.000]  being on their side
[3:37:17.000 --> 3:37:19.000]  so that it doesn't matter
[3:37:19.000 --> 3:37:21.000]  so that it won't ever happen to them
[3:37:21.000 --> 3:37:23.000]  they're really relying upon the corruption
[3:37:23.000 --> 3:37:25.000]  of our legal process
[3:37:25.000 --> 3:37:27.000]  to protect them
[3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:29.000]  not the rule of law to protect them
[3:37:29.000 --> 3:37:31.000]  the rule of law is what the corrupt political processes
[3:37:31.000 --> 3:37:33.000]  are busy changing
[3:37:33.000 --> 3:37:35.000]  busy changing so
[3:37:35.000 --> 3:37:37.000]  you say something a whole bunch of people disagree with
[3:37:37.000 --> 3:37:39.000]  those people who disagree with it
[3:37:39.000 --> 3:37:41.000]  note that the government also disagrees with you
[3:37:41.000 --> 3:37:43.000]  they can sue you into bankruptcy and oblivion
[3:37:43.000 --> 3:37:45.000]  that's the theory and premise
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:37:47.000]  and that was fully litigated
[3:37:47.000 --> 3:37:49.000]  before any of the default issues
[3:37:49.000 --> 3:37:51.000]  were even came up in the case
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:53.000]  so the first amendment is still fundamental
[3:37:53.000 --> 3:37:55.000]  and essential to the case of Alex Jones
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:37:57.000]  and will continue to be
[3:37:57.000 --> 3:37:59.000]  to pretend he somehow isn't raising that
[3:37:59.000 --> 3:38:01.000]  and that somehow isn't part of it
[3:38:01.000 --> 3:38:03.000]  are lying to themselves
[3:38:03.000 --> 3:38:05.000]  trying to say this can't happen to me
[3:38:05.000 --> 3:38:07.000]  don't worry this can't happen to me
[3:38:07.000 --> 3:38:09.000]  patting themselves on the back
[3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:11.000]  hugging themselves foolishly
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:13.000]  because yes it can happen to you
[3:38:13.000 --> 3:38:15.000]  and it will happen to you
[3:38:15.000 --> 3:38:17.000]  if you are a dissident source of information
[3:38:17.000 --> 3:38:19.000]  if you are a heretic
[3:38:19.000 --> 3:38:21.000]  out there communicating heretical information
[3:38:21.000 --> 3:38:23.000]  that questions and challenges
[3:38:23.000 --> 3:38:25.000]  the government's narrative on any set of topics
[3:38:25.000 --> 3:38:27.000]  all of them should be alert and awake
[3:38:27.000 --> 3:38:29.000]  and quit fooling themselves in that process
[3:38:29.000 --> 3:38:31.000]  in other news
[3:38:31.000 --> 3:38:33.000]  the extraordinary ability of the Biden administration
[3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:35.000]  to play Humpty Dumpty continues
[3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:37.000]  as Humpty Dumpty said
[3:38:37.000 --> 3:38:39.000]  a word is what I say it is
[3:38:39.000 --> 3:38:41.000]  and that is how a drug
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:43.000]  that's a therapeutic that's actually a gene therapy
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:45.000]  suddenly magically miraculously gets called
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:47.000]  a vaccine
[3:38:47.000 --> 3:38:49.000]  even though it doesn't inoculate you from the disease
[3:38:49.000 --> 3:38:51.000]  even though it isn't in fact safe
[3:38:51.000 --> 3:38:53.000]  even though it isn't in fact effective
[3:38:53.000 --> 3:38:55.000]  even though it in fact doesn't prevent transmission
[3:38:55.000 --> 3:38:57.000]  even though increasingly
[3:38:57.000 --> 3:38:59.000]  more places are reporting
[3:38:59.000 --> 3:39:01.000]  that the vaccinated are reporting
[3:39:01.000 --> 3:39:03.000]  higher rates of hospitalization
[3:39:03.000 --> 3:39:05.000]  higher rates of COVID
[3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:07.000]  higher rates of death
[3:39:07.000 --> 3:39:09.000]  higher rates of serious disability
[3:39:09.000 --> 3:39:11.000]  than the unvaccinated much in the same way
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:13.000]  when it came out that there had been
[3:39:13.000 --> 3:39:15.000]  two quarters of economic decline
[3:39:15.000 --> 3:39:17.000]  in GDP
[3:39:17.000 --> 3:39:19.000]  the GDP turned negative in the first quarter of
[3:39:19.000 --> 3:39:21.000]  2022 and then
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:23.000]  stayed negative in the second quarter of
[3:39:23.000 --> 3:39:25.000]  2022 historically
[3:39:25.000 --> 3:39:27.000]  universally even William
[3:39:27.000 --> 3:39:29.000]  Jefferson Clinton who had difficulty
[3:39:29.000 --> 3:39:31.000]  remembering what it is
[3:39:31.000 --> 3:39:33.000]  admitted that that is a recession
[3:39:33.000 --> 3:39:35.000]  back in 2000 well now the
[3:39:35.000 --> 3:39:37.000]  Biden administration says no no no no
[3:39:37.000 --> 3:39:39.000]  no that's not what recession
[3:39:39.000 --> 3:39:41.000]  means
[3:39:41.000 --> 3:39:43.000]  what I say it is which apparently is
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:39:45.000]  no longer what a recession means
[3:39:45.000 --> 3:39:47.000]  as we face these 1970s
[3:39:47.000 --> 3:39:49.000]  style economics continue to recommend
[3:39:49.000 --> 3:39:51.000]  George Gammon and other sources that will
[3:39:51.000 --> 3:39:53.000]  be daily providing information
[3:39:53.000 --> 3:39:55.000]  to you on the economic fallout
[3:39:55.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  ramifications but look to the 1970s
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:39:59.000]  is probably the closest historical
[3:39:59.000 --> 3:40:01.000]  parallel to what we're facing
[3:40:01.000 --> 3:40:03.000]  to constant stagflation
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:05.000]  economic decline
[3:40:05.000 --> 3:40:07.000]  economic stagnation
[3:40:07.000 --> 3:40:09.000]  with high inflation
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:11.000]  that those two are likely to continue to be
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:13.000]  parallel as we move forward
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:15.000]  and in the hypocritical
[3:40:15.000 --> 3:40:17.000]  day of the week
[3:40:17.000 --> 3:40:19.000]  we have the District of
[3:40:19.000 --> 3:40:21.000]  Columbia Mayor
[3:40:21.000 --> 3:40:23.000]  the same District of Columbia Mayor
[3:40:23.000 --> 3:40:25.000]  who refused to allow the National Guard
[3:40:25.000 --> 3:40:27.000]  to be present or anyone else
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:29.000]  on January 6th
[3:40:29.000 --> 3:40:31.000]  the same DC Mayor that was culpable
[3:40:31.000 --> 3:40:33.000]  for the extraordinary lack
[3:40:33.000 --> 3:40:35.000]  of an unusual lack of security
[3:40:35.000 --> 3:40:37.000]  present that day necessary
[3:40:37.000 --> 3:40:39.000]  to facilitate the
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:41.000]  events on January 6th for them to
[3:40:41.000 --> 3:40:43.000]  even occur in the first instance
[3:40:43.000 --> 3:40:45.000]  now says she wants the National
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:47.000]  Guard out because
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:49.000]  illegal immigrants are coming to DC
[3:40:49.000 --> 3:40:51.000]  so it turns out the District of Columbia
[3:40:51.000 --> 3:40:53.000]  only wants enough
[3:40:53.000 --> 3:40:55.000]  illegal immigrants to be able to give
[3:40:55.000 --> 3:40:57.000]  them some Ethiopian food
[3:40:57.000 --> 3:40:59.000]  and serve them some exotic foods
[3:40:59.000 --> 3:41:01.000]  and help drive some movers
[3:41:01.000 --> 3:41:03.000]  drive some taxis and be able
[3:41:03.000 --> 3:41:05.000]  to be available for some maid service
[3:41:05.000 --> 3:41:07.000]  they don't want actual
[3:41:07.000 --> 3:41:09.000]  waves of illegal immigrants coming into
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:11.000]  their community in the way the people
[3:41:11.000 --> 3:41:13.000]  in DC have brought about
[3:41:13.000 --> 3:41:15.000]  illegal immigration in massive waves
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:17.000]  in states like Texas
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:19.000]  and Arizona and what are some
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:21.000]  of the complaints that she and the Mayor
[3:41:21.000 --> 3:41:23.000]  of New York are making they're the complaints
[3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:25.000]  conservatives have made for a long time
[3:41:25.000 --> 3:41:27.000]  which is if you're going to have this level
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:29.000]  of immigration at least make it legal
[3:41:29.000 --> 3:41:31.000]  if it's not legal it shouldn't be allowed
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:33.000]  number one respect for the rule of law
[3:41:33.000 --> 3:41:35.000]  number two why should working class
[3:41:35.000 --> 3:41:37.000]  communities on the border in Texas
[3:41:37.000 --> 3:41:39.000]  and throughout the South and Midwest
[3:41:39.000 --> 3:41:41.000]  because that's where it's been disproportionately
[3:41:41.000 --> 3:41:43.000]  it's working class folks
[3:41:43.000 --> 3:41:45.000]  who see their wages decline
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:47.000]  it's working class folks who have their
[3:41:47.000 --> 3:41:49.000]  school system effectively put under pressure
[3:41:49.000 --> 3:41:51.000]  because of increasing student participation
[3:41:51.000 --> 3:41:53.000]  from those who haven't paid taxes in the first instance
[3:41:53.000 --> 3:41:55.000]  it's their roads under pressure
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:41:57.000]  their buildings under pressure
[3:41:57.000 --> 3:41:59.000]  their political infrastructure under pressure
[3:41:59.000 --> 3:42:01.000]  their criminal justice system under pressure
[3:42:01.000 --> 3:42:03.000]  they've been bearing all the burden
[3:42:03.000 --> 3:42:05.000]  and getting none of the benefit
[3:42:05.000 --> 3:42:07.000]  and now that the District of Columbia
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:09.000]  has to get some of the burden for all the benefit
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:11.000]  they've been getting over the years
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:13.000]  including their ties and connections to companies
[3:42:13.000 --> 3:42:15.000]  getting rich and getting fat
[3:42:15.000 --> 3:42:17.000]  off of illegal immigration
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:19.000]  including people connected to illicit activities
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:21.000]  and enterprises doing the same
[3:42:21.000 --> 3:42:23.000]  because DC is the capital of such activities
[3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:25.000]  in this country sadly and unfortunately
[3:42:25.000 --> 3:42:27.000]  due to the power mad nature of the people
[3:42:27.000 --> 3:42:29.000]  who occupy positions of power there
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:31.000]  they're finally having to pay the price
[3:42:31.000 --> 3:42:33.000]  and their hypocrisy is getting exposed
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:35.000]  when we come back after the break
[3:42:35.000 --> 3:42:37.000]  vaccine deaths continue
[3:42:37.000 --> 3:42:39.000]  they rock it at an extraordinary rate
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:41.000]  including hitting so many sports stars
[3:42:41.000 --> 3:42:43.000]  so many celebrities
[3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:45.000]  so many public personalities
[3:42:45.000 --> 3:42:47.000]  so many people that everybody knows
[3:42:47.000 --> 3:42:49.000]  that they can't hide and run from it anymore
[3:42:49.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  talk about those vaccine deaths
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:43:15.000]  when we come back after the break
[3:43:25.000 --> 3:43:27.000]  we're going to overcome this with your help

[3:49:25.000 --> 3:49:27.000]  and the accumulating deaths
[3:49:27.000 --> 3:49:29.000]  we keep witnessing around the globe
[3:49:29.000 --> 3:49:31.000]  from high power
[3:49:31.000 --> 3:49:33.000]  and high profile individuals
[3:49:33.000 --> 3:49:35.000]  that continue to point to the vaccine
[3:49:35.000 --> 3:49:37.000]  as the culprit
[3:49:37.000 --> 3:49:39.000]  in parts of Canada they have unexplained deaths
[3:49:39.000 --> 3:49:41.000]  leading the death charts

[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:53.000]  live but other stars and celebrities

[3:49:55.000 --> 3:49:57.000]  but before that
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:49:59.000]  just in case you're unaware
[3:49:59.000 --> 3:50:01.000]  it turns out that famine can be good for you
[3:50:01.000 --> 3:50:03.000]  that may seem strange
[3:50:03.000 --> 3:50:05.000]  it may seem like a Klaus Schwab
[3:50:05.000 --> 3:50:07.000]  Z would like these crickets
[3:50:07.000 --> 3:50:09.000]  kind of statement
[3:50:09.000 --> 3:50:11.000]  but that is according to the United Nations
[3:50:11.000 --> 3:50:13.000]  in a United States political science professor
[3:50:13.000 --> 3:50:15.000]  who is writing about the benefits
[3:50:15.000 --> 3:50:17.000]  of world hunger
[3:50:17.000 --> 3:50:19.000]  that's right the benefits
[3:50:19.000 --> 3:50:21.000]  of world hunger just in case you didn't know
[3:50:21.000 --> 3:50:23.000]  you can look up the article itself
[3:50:23.000 --> 3:50:25.000]  referenced on zero hedge and others
[3:50:25.000 --> 3:50:27.000]  that by the way those in the Alex Jones
[3:50:27.000 --> 3:50:29.000]  Sandy Hook trial want to tell you
[3:50:29.000 --> 3:50:31.000]  you should never ever go to zero hedge
[3:50:31.000 --> 3:50:33.000]  CNN that's the fountain of
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:35.000]  reliable information and truth
[3:50:35.000 --> 3:50:37.000]  they never spread any conspiracies there at CNN
[3:50:37.000 --> 3:50:39.000]  like Russiagate for four years for example
[3:50:39.000 --> 3:50:41.000]  but the
[3:50:41.000 --> 3:50:43.000]  but listen to just one of the quotes
[3:50:43.000 --> 3:50:45.000]  hunger has great
[3:50:45.000 --> 3:50:47.000]  positive value to many people
[3:50:47.000 --> 3:50:49.000]  indeed it is fundamental
[3:50:49.000 --> 3:50:51.000]  to the working of the world's economy
[3:50:51.000 --> 3:50:53.000]  hungry people are the
[3:50:53.000 --> 3:50:55.000]  most productive people
[3:50:55.000 --> 3:50:57.000]  especially when there's a need for manual labor
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:50:59.000]  so basically you can create a bunch
[3:50:59.000 --> 3:51:01.000]  a lot of cheap labor slaves
[3:51:01.000 --> 3:51:03.000]  by starving them isn't that wonderful
[3:51:03.000 --> 3:51:05.000]  they're the United Nations
[3:51:05.000 --> 3:51:07.000]  always looking out for the poor and the little folks
[3:51:07.000 --> 3:51:09.000]  as they always do
[3:51:09.000 --> 3:51:11.000]  in the same vein we have in Germany
[3:51:11.000 --> 3:51:13.000]  with their complete backfiring
[3:51:13.000 --> 3:51:15.000]  disaster and debacle of a policy in Ukraine
[3:51:15.000 --> 3:51:17.000]  already governments have
[3:51:17.000 --> 3:51:19.000]  collapsed or on the verge of collapse
[3:51:19.000 --> 3:51:21.000]  in Estonia, Bulgaria
[3:51:21.000 --> 3:51:23.000]  Italy and the United Kingdom
[3:51:23.000 --> 3:51:25.000]  partially in the front in France
[3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:27.000]  with the parliamentary elections turning against Macron
[3:51:27.000 --> 3:51:29.000]  one of the great benefits of that
[3:51:29.000 --> 3:51:31.000]  was the populist on the left
[3:51:31.000 --> 3:51:33.000]  and the populist on the right with Le Pen
[3:51:33.000 --> 3:51:35.000]  and middle shone getting together
[3:51:35.000 --> 3:51:37.000]  and actually working together
[3:51:37.000 --> 3:51:39.000]  to oppose COVID vaccine
[3:51:39.000 --> 3:51:41.000]  passports throughout the various
[3:51:41.000 --> 3:51:43.000]  French territories very positive sign
[3:51:43.000 --> 3:51:45.000]  to see some aspects of the populist
[3:51:45.000 --> 3:51:47.000]  left and right working together finally
[3:51:47.000 --> 3:51:49.000]  especially in France where that is so
[3:51:49.000 --> 3:51:51.000]  difficult to achieve you can glimpse it
[3:51:51.000 --> 3:51:53.000]  and looking at the interview between
[3:51:53.000 --> 3:51:55.000]  Glenn Greenwald and Alex Jones
[3:51:55.000 --> 3:51:57.000]  from last week's premiere again
[3:51:57.000 --> 3:51:59.000]  Alex's war is now
[3:51:59.000 --> 3:52:01.000]  fully out and available in theaters
[3:52:01.000 --> 3:52:03.000]  across the country available in a range
[3:52:03.000 --> 3:52:05.000]  of streaming platforms
[3:52:05.000 --> 3:52:07.000]  you can also buy it right here get the old
[3:52:07.000 --> 3:52:09.000]  fashion DVD
[3:52:09.000 --> 3:52:11.000]  so that you don't have to worry about it
[3:52:11.000 --> 3:52:13.000]  disappearing from your digital library
[3:52:13.000 --> 3:52:15.000]  as Amazon has been had a
[3:52:15.000 --> 3:52:17.000]  tendency to do
[3:52:17.000 --> 3:52:19.000]  you can do that at infowarstore.com
[3:52:19.000 --> 3:52:21.000]  today
[3:52:21.000 --> 3:52:23.000]  but what is happening in the ongoing Ukraine
[3:52:23.000 --> 3:52:25.000]  disaster well here's a nice
[3:52:25.000 --> 3:52:27.000]  headline German cities
[3:52:27.000 --> 3:52:29.000]  turn off hot water and cut
[3:52:29.000 --> 3:52:31.000]  lighting
[3:52:31.000 --> 3:52:33.000]  you're going to get used to a lot of cold
[3:52:33.000 --> 3:52:35.000]  showers low warming abilities
[3:52:35.000 --> 3:52:37.000]  one of the things they said was don't worry
[3:52:37.000 --> 3:52:39.000]  the Germans will build wood well you know
[3:52:39.000 --> 3:52:41.000]  they'll use wood to take care of their problem
[3:52:41.000 --> 3:52:43.000]  as winter approaches
[3:52:43.000 --> 3:52:45.000]  unfortunately most German buildings
[3:52:45.000 --> 3:52:47.000]  for climate change purposes
[3:52:47.000 --> 3:52:49.000]  have retrofitted themselves so they don't
[3:52:49.000 --> 3:52:51.000]  allow their fireplaces
[3:52:51.000 --> 3:52:53.000]  to work so that doesn't function
[3:52:53.000 --> 3:52:55.000]  either and in an effort
[3:52:55.000 --> 3:52:57.000]  to understand why it's important
[3:52:57.000 --> 3:52:59.000]  to always fight back and the value of fighting
[3:52:59.000 --> 3:53:01.000]  back is what we're seeing
[3:53:01.000 --> 3:53:03.000]  witnessing in these vaccine
[3:53:03.000 --> 3:53:05.000]  side effects that getting out independent
[3:53:05.000 --> 3:53:07.000]  information about risk is what kept a lot of
[3:53:07.000 --> 3:53:09.000]  people from unnecessarily taking
[3:53:09.000 --> 3:53:11.000]  this drug I have filed suit
[3:53:11.000 --> 3:53:13.000]  on behalf of children's health defense against
[3:53:13.000 --> 3:53:15.000]  the Food and Drug Administration
[3:53:15.000 --> 3:53:17.000]  with Robert Kennedy challenging
[3:53:17.000 --> 3:53:19.000]  their authorization and marketing
[3:53:19.000 --> 3:53:21.000]  of the vaccine particularly to
[3:53:21.000 --> 3:53:23.000]  children but also to the military one
[3:53:23.000 --> 3:53:25.000]  case is pending before the 6th
[3:53:25.000 --> 3:53:27.000]  Circuit Court of Appeals another is pending
[3:53:27.000 --> 3:53:29.000]  in Waco, Texas here in the western
[3:53:29.000 --> 3:53:31.000]  district of Texas because they have
[3:53:31.000 --> 3:53:33.000]  so repeatedly lied using Big Bird
[3:53:33.000 --> 3:53:35.000]  and Elmo to convince people something
[3:53:35.000 --> 3:53:37.000]  is safe effective vaccine that
[3:53:37.000 --> 3:53:39.000]  is in fact an experimental drug
[3:53:39.000 --> 3:53:41.000]  using gene therapy
[3:53:41.000 --> 3:53:43.000]  that does not inoculate you against
[3:53:43.000 --> 3:53:45.000]  getting the disease does not inoculate
[3:53:45.000 --> 3:53:47.000]  you against transmitting the disease and
[3:53:47.000 --> 3:53:49.000]  is not in fact the definition of a vaccine
[3:53:49.000 --> 3:53:51.000]  nor is it safe or effective under
[3:53:51.000 --> 3:53:53.000]  their own literature and available data
[3:53:53.000 --> 3:53:55.000]  as is supported by Brooke Jackson's case
[3:53:55.000 --> 3:53:57.000]  brought against Pfizer pending
[3:53:57.000 --> 3:53:59.000]  over in another part of the
[3:53:59.000 --> 3:54:01.000]  federal courts in Texas in Beaumont
[3:54:01.000 --> 3:54:03.000]  but in this context
[3:54:03.000 --> 3:54:05.000]  just take a look just go through any of your
[3:54:05.000 --> 3:54:07.000]  headlines and find the people that are just
[3:54:07.000 --> 3:54:09.000]  suddenly dying they are even calling it
[3:54:09.000 --> 3:54:11.000]  SADS which is SAD
[3:54:11.000 --> 3:54:13.000]  that sudden adult death syndrome
[3:54:13.000 --> 3:54:15.000]  don't know where this is coming from people
[3:54:15.000 --> 3:54:17.000]  they get the vaccine they get the shot
[3:54:17.000 --> 3:54:19.000]  they get a booster boom they are dead
[3:54:19.000 --> 3:54:21.000]  don't know what could possibly be the cause
[3:54:21.000 --> 3:54:23.000]  yet we are getting person after person
[3:54:23.000 --> 3:54:25.000]  a Colombian Latin American singer
[3:54:25.000 --> 3:54:27.000]  prominent sports players
[3:54:27.000 --> 3:54:29.000]  prominent celebrities
[3:54:29.000 --> 3:54:31.000]  around the globe that this has happened to
[3:54:31.000 --> 3:54:33.000]  this shows a continued warning
[3:54:33.000 --> 3:54:35.000]  sign that the government has not been
[3:54:35.000 --> 3:54:37.000]  honest not been forthcoming
[3:54:37.000 --> 3:54:39.000]  about the real scope of adverse events
[3:54:39.000 --> 3:54:41.000]  as Obama himself admitted this was a
[3:54:41.000 --> 3:54:43.000]  mass experiment on billions of people
[3:54:43.000 --> 3:54:45.000]  and we are starting to see the consequences
[3:54:45.000 --> 3:54:47.000]  already as being far more
[3:54:47.000 --> 3:54:49.000]  for more devastating and dangerous
[3:54:49.000 --> 3:54:51.000]  to the health especially of young people
[3:54:51.000 --> 3:54:53.000]  than COVID could be especially
[3:54:53.000 --> 3:54:55.000]  the omercron version of it
[3:54:55.000 --> 3:54:57.000]  but to give you sort of a white pill
[3:54:57.000 --> 3:54:59.000]  as we exit tonight
[3:54:59.000 --> 3:55:01.000]  it is important to remember why it matters
[3:55:01.000 --> 3:55:03.000]  that you continue to not only participate
[3:55:03.000 --> 3:55:05.000]  and support info wars
[3:55:05.000 --> 3:55:07.000]  but participate in the court of public opinion
[3:55:07.000 --> 3:55:09.000]  to continue to be involved at whatever
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:11.000]  level that you can be or choose to be
[3:55:11.000 --> 3:55:13.000]  because your ability to fight back
[3:55:13.000 --> 3:55:15.000]  in the court of public opinion is the only
[3:55:15.000 --> 3:55:17.000]  reason why billions of people
[3:55:17.000 --> 3:55:19.000]  around the globe have not taken
[3:55:19.000 --> 3:55:21.000]  this dangerous drug
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:23.000]  it's the only reason why
[3:55:23.000 --> 3:55:25.000]  your willingness and readiness to fight back
[3:55:25.000 --> 3:55:27.000]  even LA County
[3:55:27.000 --> 3:55:29.000]  had to reverse its intentions
[3:55:29.000 --> 3:55:31.000]  to reimpose
[3:55:31.000 --> 3:55:33.000]  a mask mandate in the
[3:55:33.000 --> 3:55:35.000]  county of Los Angeles
[3:55:35.000 --> 3:55:37.000]  they were eager to do so they were anxious
[3:55:37.000 --> 3:55:39.000]  to do so they declared their intention
[3:55:39.000 --> 3:55:41.000]  to do so but then ordinary people
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:43.000]  in the court of public opinion
[3:55:43.000 --> 3:55:45.000]  spoke out and spoke back
[3:55:45.000 --> 3:55:47.000]  against it and what happened
[3:55:47.000 --> 3:55:49.000]  well here's the headline
[3:55:49.000 --> 3:55:51.000]  LA County Public Health Director
[3:55:51.000 --> 3:55:53.000]  Ferrer won't mandate
[3:55:53.000 --> 3:55:55.000]  masks now
[3:55:55.000 --> 3:55:57.000]  so that's only because
[3:55:57.000 --> 3:55:59.000]  you chose to fight back
[3:55:59.000 --> 3:56:01.000]  you chose to push back
[3:56:01.000 --> 3:56:03.000]  so part of it is being self educated
[3:56:03.000 --> 3:56:05.000]  and self educated is a function of self empowerment
[3:56:05.000 --> 3:56:07.000]  part of it is supporting those
[3:56:07.000 --> 3:56:09.000]  content creators and independent
[3:56:09.000 --> 3:56:11.000]  media providers that provide
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:13.000]  you access to that information in the first place
[3:56:13.000 --> 3:56:15.000]  and also the ability to share it
[3:56:15.000 --> 3:56:17.000]  with others
[3:56:17.000 --> 3:56:19.000]  to be able to get it and influence
[3:56:19.000 --> 3:56:21.000]  the court of public opinion and then
[3:56:21.000 --> 3:56:23.000]  ultimately sharing your opinion
[3:56:23.000 --> 3:56:25.000]  with that is now informed and well educated
[3:56:25.000 --> 3:56:27.000]  with the public and engaging the public
[3:56:27.000 --> 3:56:29.000]  in dialogue discussion and debate
[3:56:29.000 --> 3:56:31.000]  to try to influence the shape
[3:56:31.000 --> 3:56:33.000]  and direction of it without infowars
[3:56:33.000 --> 3:56:35.000]  there never is a president Donald
[3:56:35.000 --> 3:56:37.000]  John Trump without infowars
[3:56:37.000 --> 3:56:39.000]  there's no pushback against lockdowns
[3:56:39.000 --> 3:56:41.000]  without infowars there's no pushback
[3:56:41.000 --> 3:56:43.000]  on them shutting down our schools
[3:56:43.000 --> 3:56:45.000]  without infowars there's no pushback
[3:56:45.000 --> 3:56:47.000]  on mask mandates
[3:56:47.000 --> 3:56:49.000]  without infowars there's no pushback
[3:56:49.000 --> 3:56:51.000]  against election corruption
[3:56:51.000 --> 3:56:53.000]  without infowars there's no pushback
[3:56:53.000 --> 3:56:55.000]  against the war propagandists
[3:56:55.000 --> 3:56:57.000]  look at all the war whores and how they all united
[3:56:57.000 --> 3:56:59.000]  for pushing this completely bogus war
[3:56:59.000 --> 3:57:01.000]  in Ukraine that was
[3:57:01.000 --> 3:57:03.000]  built on lie after lie after lie
[3:57:03.000 --> 3:57:05.000]  libel after libel after libel
[3:57:05.000 --> 3:57:07.000]  when the New York Times gets caught
[3:57:07.000 --> 3:57:09.000]  libeling and killing millions of people
[3:57:09.000 --> 3:57:11.000]  around the globe once again
[3:57:11.000 --> 3:57:13.000]  in another global war conflict
[3:57:13.000 --> 3:57:15.000]  that didn't need to happen but for their lies
[3:57:15.000 --> 3:57:17.000]  they're never held accountable
[3:57:17.000 --> 3:57:19.000]  they're coming after infowars
[3:57:19.000 --> 3:57:21.000]  because infowars is at the tip of the spear
[3:57:21.000 --> 3:57:23.000]  and stopping and preventing and precluding
[3:57:23.000 --> 3:57:25.000]  and exposing deep state
[3:57:25.000 --> 3:57:27.000]  bad actions and conduct
[3:57:27.000 --> 3:57:29.000]  so continue to support infowars
[3:57:29.000 --> 3:57:31.000]  continue to be the front of the line
[3:57:31.000 --> 3:57:33.000]  hold the line and together we will make
[3:57:33.000 --> 3:57:35.000]  sure independent information continues
[3:57:35.000 --> 3:57:37.000]  to get out there to be shared with you
[3:57:37.000 --> 3:57:39.000]  because you are part of the changing the world
