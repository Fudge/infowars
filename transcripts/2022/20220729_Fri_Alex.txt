[00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:01.650]  So I am in anguish.
[00:00:01.951 --> 00:00:02.871]  I am in torture.
[00:00:03.312 --> 00:00:04.253]  I am in pain.
[00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:05.854]  I am upset.
[00:00:06.094 --> 00:00:18.645]  I am having nightmares over the destruction of our species, not over the fact that I am trying to fight these people and they know if they just kill me outright or put me in prison outright, that would turn me into a bigger martyr.
[00:00:18.865 --> 00:00:34.813]   So they think setting me against dead kids in a rigged trial of lies where we can't even defend ourselves and where the judge already says we're guilty, They think that's the only way they can then demonize the archetypal resistor, the archetypal populist who's fighting them.
[00:00:35.273 --> 00:00:41.215]  But the result is the vast majority of people have absolutely seen through it.
[00:00:41.775 --> 00:01:06.092]   So the Democrats and their lawyers and their controlled corrupt judges can sit there and pretend in their little rotting bubbles of the collapsing dinosaur media and the collapsing judiciary and the collapsing economy that they're beating me When I have already made the decision to do this mission, whether I get killed, put in prison, tortured, made homeless, that means nothing to me!
[00:01:07.742 --> 00:01:13.525]  People that love football or basketball or baseball like I did growing up, I would get so upset when my team lost.
[00:01:13.605 --> 00:01:21.830]  I would get so upset when things like... And then finally, as I learned about the world and history, I was like, I'm a fool to care about this.
[00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.992]  Not that it's bad to watch sports, but it's bad to make it your top thing.
[00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:39.483]   And so when I see unborn children being killed, and six-month-old babies being given experimental shots, and five-year-olds being tricked by public schools that they're really a girl, and signing up when they're 10 to have their testicles chopped off, And their penis is cut off.
[00:01:41.345 --> 00:01:45.869]  I take that personally, because I have empathy, because I know it's happening to all of us.
[00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.270]  I'm connected to everyone.
[00:01:48.932 --> 00:01:53.216]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:53.075 --> 00:01:58.875]  creates worldwide in defense of human liberty is Alex Jones.
[00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:18.995]  InfoWars.
[00:02:19.213 --> 00:02:20.113]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:02:20.193 --> 00:02:36.112]  today.
[00:02:36.341 --> 00:02:38.742]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:47.443]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:47.443 --> 00:02:54.443]  [Music]
[00:02:54.443 --> 00:02:57.443]  [Music]
[00:02:57.443 --> 00:03:04.443]   Recently, the central bank digital currencies have been the talking point at the global confabs
[00:03:04.443 --> 00:03:09.443]   because they lead to the creation of a global currency system.
[00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:15.854]  Good afternoon everybody and welcome to the session on resetting digital currencies.
[00:03:16.394 --> 00:03:21.355]  The theme of this year's forum, as you know, is a crucial year to rebuild trust.
[00:03:22.015 --> 00:03:25.676]  The digital payment system can help reduce these logistical costs.
[00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:29.876]  can help remove the dangers of holding cash.
[00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:40.276]   As the architects of multiple global crises pour on the tyranny, the IMF is enjoying an elevated position as the problem solver
[00:03:40.276 --> 00:03:45.075]   most nations turn to for help, racketeering on a global scale.
[00:03:45.075 --> 00:03:53.344]   With all the current issues on our agenda, we tend to forget that we are in the midst of the fourth
[00:03:53.344 --> 00:03:59.675]   industrial revolution, which accelerates global change in much more comprehensive
[00:03:59.675 --> 00:04:03.876]   and faster ways than the previous three revolutions.
[00:04:04.062 --> 00:04:09.365]  The objective is to quickly recognize the potential of new technologies.
[00:04:09.725 --> 00:04:13.668]  History is truly at a turning point.
[00:04:14.248 --> 00:04:21.113]  We do not yet know the full extent and the systemic and structural changes which will happen.
[00:04:22.486 --> 00:04:31.748]  However, we do know that global energy systems, food systems, and supply chains will be deeply affected.
[00:04:32.448 --> 00:04:47.372]  And as Bloomberg gleefully reported, key Democratic congressional allies are urging President Joe Biden's administration to support a new injection of resources for countries at the IMF to help them deal with the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
[00:04:47.472 --> 00:04:59.341]  To the tune of at least $650 billion in additional IMF reserve assets, the demand is being led by Representative Pramila Jayapal and Senator Elizabeth Warren.
[00:04:59.581 --> 00:05:11.649]  Zero Hedge recently put the puzzle pieces together concerning the Democrats' proposed $650 billion flooding of the IMF with special drawing right funds.
[00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.591]  What are special drawing right funds?
[00:05:15.792 --> 00:05:24.700]  The Special Drawing Rights, or SDR, was created by the IMF in 1969 to supplement the official reserves of its member countries.
[00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:36.950]  The SDR is an interest-bearing international reserve asset that can only be held by the IMF, its member countries, and designated official entities known as prescribed holders.
[00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:44.954]  In addition to this role, the SDR serves as the unit of account of the IMF and several other international organizations.
[00:05:45.334 --> 00:05:50.375]  Zero Hedge writes, each new crisis brings global banks closer to their goal.
[00:05:50.655 --> 00:05:59.519]   The introduction of national digital currencies and the SDR basket Become the de facto reserve trading tool for the world.
[00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.781]  Why do Democrats specifically want aid denominated in SDRs?
[00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:08.002]  Because funding allocations in the U.S.
[00:06:08.263 --> 00:06:13.325]  have already hit their maximum, and new funding bills are being defeated in the Senate.
[00:06:13.585 --> 00:06:16.746]  At the IMF, there are no checks and balances.
[00:06:17.086 --> 00:06:23.549]  They can ask for almost any amount of money in the form of SDRs without oversight.
[00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:33.932]  There are always strings attached when it comes to the IMF, and in exchange for SDRs, the globalists will certainly want more centralized control.
[00:06:34.192 --> 00:06:37.833]  The Ukrainian war is not merely a money laundering operation.
[00:06:38.113 --> 00:06:48.096]  It is a linchpin to transfer the global economy out of the money printing of central banks, and directly into the hands of globalists controlling the IMF.
[00:06:48.436 --> 00:06:54.601]  We are being looted in real time of our property, currency, sovereignty, and our very lives.
[00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:56.262]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:06:58.945 --> 00:06:59.585]  It's Friday, July 29th.
[00:06:59.605 --> 00:07:00.586]  The year is 2022.
[00:07:01.787 --> 00:07:17.626]   It's Friday, July 29th, the year is 2022, and we really hit a nerve with the establishment yesterday.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:30.884]  Scores of New World Order mouthpieces lashed out and said, Alex Jones claims he's Jesus Christ, which couldn't be further from the truth.
[00:07:32.104 --> 00:07:38.646]  I'm a lot closer to the devil than I am to Jesus in my flesh, but in my spirit I want to be Christ-like and I follow Christ.
[00:07:39.567 --> 00:07:56.223]   But what nerve did I hit when I really started pushing Twenty years ago, about endocrine disruptors in the food and water, sterilizing and feminizing men and hyper-feminizing women, and then causing cancer and accelerated aging, they flipped out very early on.
[00:07:56.243 --> 00:07:59.644]  Then of course, the last decade, they've obsessed over it.
[00:07:59.824 --> 00:08:00.784]  And of course, it's all true.
[00:08:00.824 --> 00:08:02.004]  Now it's the top story everywhere.
[00:08:02.024 --> 00:08:03.645]  And they just say, it's irreversible.
[00:08:03.665 --> 00:08:04.865]  Almost everybody's infernal.
[00:08:05.765 --> 00:08:06.945]  The life expectancy is dropping.
[00:08:06.985 --> 00:08:07.505]  Get used to it.
[00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:16.921]   Well, yesterday I talked about Human dominion and human supremacy over the earth.
[00:08:18.481 --> 00:08:24.763]  Because the globalists want to build their AI transhumanist supremacy.
[00:08:24.783 --> 00:08:28.384]  And I said the world's really divided into two camps.
[00:08:29.144 --> 00:08:51.166]   Those that believe in human supremacy as given to us by God in Genesis, and if you don't believe in that, even if you don't believe in that, You're just going to let other humans claim that they have supremacy over you and make you a slave.
[00:08:52.327 --> 00:09:01.934]  That's why the founders, even though some of them didn't believe in God, most of them did, said we're going to say we're endowed by our Creator with certain rights so that there's not a king above that.
[00:09:02.835 --> 00:09:07.899]  By putting God on top, and we're made in the image of God, we put ourselves on top.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.267]   So this whole movement is Anti-human.
[00:09:13.647 --> 00:09:17.952]  And that's what Satan is, whether you believe Satan's a real thing or an archetype.
[00:09:18.533 --> 00:09:25.280]  These are manifestations of how humans behave and the different choices that we have in our world.
[00:09:27.182 --> 00:09:36.918]   So at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to try to do a very calm version of the rant I did for 10 minutes that you can see at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:37.038 --> 00:09:41.039]  Alex Jones, the human supremacist legendary speech.
[00:09:41.059 --> 00:09:41.980]  That's what the crew called it.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:49.062]  And I think it really is a legendary speech because it lays down the two choices we have.
[00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:50.702]  We're made in the image of God.
[00:09:50.762 --> 00:09:51.982]  We have divine potential.
[00:09:52.282 --> 00:09:53.423]  We can do incredible things.
[00:09:53.463 --> 00:09:54.763]  We're building a better world.
[00:09:55.123 --> 00:09:58.044]  We're going to go interplanetary, intergalactic, interdimensional.
[00:09:59.301 --> 00:10:05.504]  Or we're just programmable blobs of flesh ruled by our overlords that tell us we don't have free will, even though we do.
[00:10:07.605 --> 00:10:10.306]  So there were a lot of articles, and I was sitting right before I went live.
[00:10:10.326 --> 00:10:13.728]  I almost got late getting on air because I was in my office reading.
[00:10:15.349 --> 00:10:17.890]  And I meant to run in and tell the crew, just type in Alex Jones.
[00:10:19.451 --> 00:10:21.612]  Without even looking this morning, I saw dozens of the articles.
[00:10:21.692 --> 00:10:23.893]  Alex Jones compares himself to Jesus.
[00:10:24.613 --> 00:10:27.455]  Alex Jones goes completely crazy on air.
[00:10:29.093 --> 00:10:30.474]  And talks about human supremacy.
[00:10:30.954 --> 00:10:32.575]  But I didn't compare myself to Jesus.
[00:10:32.655 --> 00:10:36.578]  I said that Christ said we'll be persecuted as He was if we follow Him.
[00:10:37.138 --> 00:10:39.240]  But that on the other side of that is transcendence.
[00:10:40.581 --> 00:10:42.022]  Just basic Christian ethos.
[00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:50.307]  So I'm going to lay this out, as I said at the bottom, at the bottom of the hour.
[00:10:50.327 --> 00:10:52.428]  Maybe you folks in there will print me a few of those articles.
[00:10:52.448 --> 00:10:53.969]  There's so many I forgot to send them to you.
[00:10:55.550 --> 00:11:04.947]   Because it really illustrates how panicked they are That we're pointing out what their cult is and what its ongoing plans for all of us are.
[00:11:05.668 --> 00:11:14.111]  And I've got some real illustrations that tie into all of this that we're going to be laying out as well here today on this live broadcast.
[00:11:15.632 --> 00:11:19.633]  But here's just one example of what I'm talking about.
[00:11:19.733 --> 00:11:20.654]  CBS News.
[00:11:22.735 --> 00:11:24.755]  And I've got one out of New Scientist.
[00:11:26.056 --> 00:11:43.030]   Scientists have created reanimated Necrobots that were formerly spiders that can lift 100 times their weight and are being programmed to go out and carry out missions.
[00:11:44.511 --> 00:11:50.557]  Now, imagine if I was just reading a research paper, which I read years ago about these developments and I did talk about it.
[00:11:51.257 --> 00:11:52.418]  They'd say, Jones is insane.
[00:11:52.438 --> 00:11:53.980]  He says they're creating zombie spiders.
[00:11:55.575 --> 00:12:05.638]  And I'm sure today when I do a whole breakdown of it, the establishment will clip it out, edit out where I show this is being done, the video, the articles, and they'll just say, he's insane.
[00:12:06.019 --> 00:12:08.159]  He says they're creating zombie robot spiders.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.301]  And then why would they do that?
[00:12:12.361 --> 00:12:18.463]  Why would they, out of one side of their mouth, admit they're doing it, but on the other side, attack yours truly?
[00:12:21.238 --> 00:12:26.879]  And the answer is, they want to precondition you that it's a joke as they roll it out against you.
[00:12:27.959 --> 00:12:29.499]  Ha ha ha, Stephen Colbert!
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:39.181]  Jimmy Kimmel and all of them said in the last decade, Alex Jones is crazy, he thinks they're putting chemicals in the water that turn the frogs gay.
[00:12:39.281 --> 00:12:40.601]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:12:41.041 --> 00:12:42.622]  Even though that's exactly what they're doing.
[00:12:42.642 --> 00:12:46.182]  Doesn't really turn them gay, it feminizes them and sterilizes them.
[00:12:48.443 --> 00:12:56.368]   So that's just one article Necrobot, that means dead creatures that are now robots.
[00:12:56.528 --> 00:13:04.554]  That's not a Star Trek episode where we are the Borg, you will be assimilated, resistance is futile.
[00:13:07.316 --> 00:13:08.316]  This is 2022, robot spiders.
[00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.013]  And again, I told you this not to act impressive.
[00:13:15.693 --> 00:13:16.774]  It wasn't that impressive.
[00:13:17.495 --> 00:13:20.658]  It was an industrial level operation in the early 1980s.
[00:13:22.591 --> 00:13:41.582]  Where pioneering oral surgeons and dentists, like my father, who were the first doing dental implants, were approached to go work at Site R in Maryland, underground, where they would work several months underground, and then a month out, several months underground, a month out.
[00:13:41.902 --> 00:13:46.085]  And I sat there, around the corner, my parents stayed late at the dinner table.
[00:13:47.850 --> 00:14:17.263]   And I learned that when I got done eating they'd sit at the dinner table sometimes for an hour drinking coffee or tea and talk about things and I many times sat around the corner listening to things I shouldn't have listened to and I since talked about that about it years later and he said it wasn't a big deal they got approached by the CIA and my dad as a Baylor medical school professor had done work for the CIA, but only because they had chosen
[00:14:17.263 --> 00:14:22.454]   that facility to have CIA officials have their dental work done because they'd have armed
[00:14:22.454 --> 00:14:24.944]   people in the room when they were doing the dental work.
[00:14:24.944 --> 00:14:25.944]  So they knew my dad, he'd done a lot of dental work.
[00:14:25.944 --> 00:14:27.864]  I'm a deputy director and people like that.
[00:14:27.864 --> 00:14:30.424]   And we had some family that had been to the CIA, so that's probably why they chose him
[00:14:30.424 --> 00:14:31.904]  to be their dentist.
[00:14:31.904 --> 00:14:34.784]   But he was trying to convince my mom because he wanted to do it.
[00:14:35.031 --> 00:14:37.092]  And plus it was like $400, $500,000 a year.
[00:14:37.152 --> 00:14:39.154]  Back then that'd be like $3, $4 million a year.
[00:14:40.014 --> 00:14:40.915]  He said, I want to go do it.
[00:14:40.935 --> 00:14:41.415]  It's exciting.
[00:14:41.435 --> 00:14:42.136]  She goes, well, what is it?
[00:14:42.156 --> 00:14:43.457]  He goes, well, I can't tell you, Carol.
[00:14:43.477 --> 00:14:44.858]  You know, it's classified.
[00:14:44.898 --> 00:14:47.260]  They haven't told me everything, but it's cybernetics.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.260]  It's cyborgs.
[00:14:48.741 --> 00:14:57.287]  He goes, I'd imagine, you know, they kind of let me know they were going to be implanting volunteer soldiers and spies with things.
[00:14:58.533 --> 00:15:00.895]  Since I'm good at implanting things in bone, they told me.
[00:15:01.395 --> 00:15:03.437]  And he said, first we'll be practicing on animals.
[00:15:04.798 --> 00:15:11.383]  But there's a large project, and he said, you know, they've already recruited doctors such and such and such and such and such.
[00:15:11.423 --> 00:15:34.278]   So in like 1982 or three, I forget the exact year, maybe it was about 84, I'm around the corner listening to a 20-minute conversation about underground bases and cyborgs and how they were already recruiting dozens of Dallas Oral surgeons to be part of the project and that they wanted basically my dad to lead part of it in some expansion.
[00:15:34.939 --> 00:15:35.839]  And that's all they told him.
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.141]  But see, you know, you tell stories like that it sounds crazy, but now it's all out in the open.
[00:15:40.542 --> 00:15:51.227]  And if you think they were implanting soldiers with secret technology in 1984 at underground bases in Maryland, folks, what do you think they're doing now?
[00:15:54.089 --> 00:15:58.093]   What do you think They're doing now.
[00:15:59.934 --> 00:16:00.814]  We're not in the year 2022.
[00:16:00.894 --> 00:16:03.576]  We're like in the year 2050, technologically.
[00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:09.399]  And they're about to roll out this whole separate civilization, this breakaway civilization against us.
[00:16:09.639 --> 00:16:11.100]  And that's what everything's really about.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.041]  This civilization, as you know, it's gone.
[00:16:16.562 --> 00:16:25.627]  But we chose to let our problems multiply because we're faithfully pursuing a policy of truth.
[00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:31.488]  And that's why they spend all their time trying to say we're wrong, we lie.
[00:16:31.508 --> 00:16:36.251]  They try to pick a few things we didn't get exactly right, or we question, so we're the devil.
[00:16:37.632 --> 00:16:42.774]  Because they want the power to silence your speech and what you're allowed to read, watch, or listen to.
[00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:46.156]  They're trying to control our reality.
[00:16:46.176 --> 00:16:51.819]  All right, let me just hit what's coming up today, because it's just an incredible time to be alive.
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:17:01.217]   Big tech is censoring Even mainline economists that say we're officially in a recession, even though we're officially in a recession.
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.341]  Think of the level of that gaslighting.
[00:17:05.381 --> 00:17:06.402]  Got a big stack on that.
[00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:14.128]  Had incredible announcements on the COVID front with them announcing, I told you it would happen.
[00:17:14.548 --> 00:17:19.828]   I told you this three years ago or 32 months ago, over two and a half years ago,
[00:17:19.828 --> 00:17:26.868]   is they have a similar virus that attacks chickens and other fowl, other poultry.
[00:17:26.868 --> 00:17:36.387]   And once they keep giving the chickens or the ducks or the turkeys these shots,
[00:17:36.387 --> 00:17:43.469]   because they stopped working, they then give them this super shot
[00:17:44.469 --> 00:17:49.388]   that totally changes their entire physiology and they basically become these bloated mutants
[00:17:49.388 --> 00:17:51.189]  full of tumors.
[00:17:51.189 --> 00:17:58.646]   This particular name for the vaccine induced disorder There's actually several big disorders.
[00:17:59.447 --> 00:18:09.731]  Well, I told you, if you take five or six of the first mutagenic shots, then they have a super shot that mutates you and makes all your joints basically double in size.
[00:18:11.212 --> 00:18:19.896]  And sure enough, they've announced a super shot that will fix everything because the other shot didn't work and erased your immune system.
[00:18:21.192 --> 00:18:24.013]  Biden administration unveil reformulated booster shot.
[00:18:24.293 --> 00:18:26.133]  Australia's calling it a super shot.
[00:18:27.313 --> 00:18:29.194]  This one shot will now suddenly work.
[00:18:29.214 --> 00:18:30.154]  The first four or five didn't.
[00:18:30.894 --> 00:18:33.315]  Biden administration unveil reformulated booster shot.
[00:18:35.855 --> 00:18:38.976]  We've got a bunch of compilations of Fauci and Bricks flip-flopping.
[00:18:42.597 --> 00:18:46.178]  Anthony Fauci is still funding China's military-run labs with U.S.
[00:18:46.218 --> 00:18:46.998]  taxpayer money.
[00:18:48.516 --> 00:18:51.138]  While the Biden administration accuses China of creating the virus.
[00:18:51.678 --> 00:18:53.800]  So you got censored for two and a half years for saying that.
[00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:56.922]  But now Biden's openly accusing China.
[00:18:58.483 --> 00:18:59.424]  They're accusing the U.S.
[00:18:59.464 --> 00:19:00.004]  military.
[00:19:00.484 --> 00:19:01.325]  It is man-made.
[00:19:01.885 --> 00:19:05.928]  But then we're still told, but for you, you can't say, oh, you were right.
[00:19:06.248 --> 00:19:06.909]  You were vindicated.
[00:19:06.929 --> 00:19:07.249]  No, no, no.
[00:19:07.289 --> 00:19:08.170]  You're still censored.
[00:19:09.711 --> 00:19:11.432]  As a general public, if you point that out.
[00:19:12.662 --> 00:19:19.366]  Rand Paul is up on Infowars.com has congratulated Biden for achieving real immunity after he's already had COVID three times in four shots.
[00:19:20.707 --> 00:19:23.769]  But if he hadn't taken the shots, he would have already gotten real immunity.
[00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:31.955]  Meanwhile, Tour de France cyclist who quit race says many people are suffering from breathing problems because they've been vaccinated and heart attacks.
[00:19:33.933 --> 00:19:36.814]  That's just a small smattering of the news.
[00:19:37.035 --> 00:19:38.175]  I kind of just got into that.
[00:19:38.235 --> 00:19:51.622]  But look at all the dehumanization news we're going to hit that ties in to whether we're going to have globalist AI supremacy or God-given Genesis supremacy.
[00:19:52.463 --> 00:19:55.584]  German cities turn off hot water, cut lighting at government buildings.
[00:19:56.044 --> 00:19:57.485]  Israel bans use of cash.
[00:19:58.246 --> 00:19:58.866]  Cash is banned.
[00:19:59.923 --> 00:20:01.124]  You will own nothing and be happy.
[00:20:01.184 --> 00:20:05.626]  PSA's being announced everywhere, including the school children, that you won't own a house, a car, anything.
[00:20:05.666 --> 00:20:06.487]  A new system's here.
[00:20:07.067 --> 00:20:09.448]  We're in a beautiful transition, you know, the collapse.
[00:20:09.949 --> 00:20:13.090]  World Economic Forum calls for an end of personal vehicle ownership.
[00:20:13.871 --> 00:20:17.793]  And now, I told you this was coming 20 years ago, because I could see where they were headed.
[00:20:19.854 --> 00:20:24.517]  Australia is now moving to make you wear a helmet to walk.
[00:20:26.298 --> 00:20:28.479]  They've already started saying no helmet, no running.
[00:20:31.135 --> 00:20:44.182]  But now they're saying they're going to start fitting children with helmets that, oh, because it might save a life, also have VR goggles that are AI that the system can hit a button and make the children go under VR control.
[00:20:44.822 --> 00:20:45.422]  That's been announced.
[00:20:46.143 --> 00:20:48.664]  They're going to fit them with VR helmets by law.
[00:20:49.795 --> 00:20:51.456]  So, that's the next phase of that.
[00:20:52.177 --> 00:20:58.681]  This is all happening, it's all rolling out, it's all being done to suck you out of reality and force you finally into the Matrix.
[00:20:59.441 --> 00:21:07.987]  Which is the final goal, a total 3D immersion Matrix to try to trick you into giving up your soul to these people.
[00:21:09.088 --> 00:21:10.589]  All joggers must wear a helmet.
[00:21:11.089 --> 00:21:12.070]  No helmet, no run.
[00:21:13.015 --> 00:21:17.797]  First they lock you down for a couple years with the COVID hysteria, and they go, oh, it's really to save the earth.
[00:21:18.538 --> 00:21:20.159]  And you got to wear helmets everywhere you go.
[00:21:20.399 --> 00:21:27.062]  Oh, and now we're going to make the children at public schools and elsewhere wear VR goggles in school.
[00:21:27.102 --> 00:21:30.323]  And then, oh, you got to wear them all the time for your safety.
[00:21:30.343 --> 00:21:33.685]  Because I told you years ago, they're going to make you wear a helmet to leave your house.
[00:21:33.705 --> 00:21:34.986]  You'd laugh, but now.
[00:21:36.266 --> 00:21:37.567]  Here it is.
[00:21:37.627 --> 00:21:38.928]  We've got that information.
[00:21:39.368 --> 00:21:45.172]  Mother loses custody of daughter for refusing transgender status, saying she's a girl right here in America.
[00:21:46.252 --> 00:21:47.253]  That all ties together.
[00:21:48.293 --> 00:21:53.677]  We have so much to get into on the military front that nobody's giving any coverage to now.
[00:21:54.077 --> 00:22:00.581]  In Ukraine, and China's heating up big time, China's army chief says, get ready for war.
[00:22:03.323 --> 00:22:03.823]  Over U.S.
[00:22:03.863 --> 00:22:04.764]  visit to Taiwan.
[00:22:05.816 --> 00:22:08.998]  That ties into Nancy Pelosi's visit and so much more.
[00:22:09.118 --> 00:22:13.440]  And Trump is really starting to get hardcore.
[00:22:14.021 --> 00:22:21.825]  On one side he's exposing pedophile rings and the Democratic Party are a bunch of pedophiles calling him sickos, pushing sexual content to kindergartners.
[00:22:22.505 --> 00:22:24.206]  He's come out and said nobody's gotten to the bottom of 9-11.
[00:22:24.306 --> 00:22:27.448]  He said there were bombs in the building two days after it happened.
[00:22:29.005 --> 00:22:29.686]  He's a smart guy.
[00:22:30.446 --> 00:22:38.973]  But similarly, though, he's done a lot of other really good things, exposing the open border and bad trade deals.
[00:22:39.774 --> 00:22:41.815]  But he's still pushing that poison shot.
[00:22:42.196 --> 00:22:47.260]  Even when Burks, his own top advisor, says, we knew it wouldn't work, but we told Trump it would.
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.542]  She admits, we knew it wouldn't work, but we told him it would.
[00:22:50.943 --> 00:22:52.484]  And so he listened to his science advisors.
[00:22:52.724 --> 00:22:57.608]  You got 20 doctors in the room, and you're somebody like Trump, you know, 77 years old or whatever he is.
[00:22:58.709 --> 00:23:00.330]  Especially old-timers believe doctors.
[00:23:01.111 --> 00:23:07.615]  So, I mean, I'll give a pass on being conned, but man, I'm not gonna give Trump a pass if he doesn't start coming out against this now.
[00:23:07.655 --> 00:23:10.858]  He should say, I was conned, I was manipulated, they lied.
[00:23:11.058 --> 00:23:16.001]  Because it's coming out that the shots don't help you and erase your immune system and really hurt you.
[00:23:16.442 --> 00:23:21.886]  So, this is a real deal killer for me.
[00:23:22.956 --> 00:23:28.659]  If Trump doesn't do what Bolsonaro did, he didn't support the shots, he just allowed it.
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:36.504]  He says, I apologize, it should have been outlawed, they were experimental, they've hurt and maimed and killed a lot of people, I apologize, I was lied to.
[00:23:37.124 --> 00:23:37.605]  Yes!
[00:23:38.205 --> 00:23:39.686]  That's the manly thing to do.
[00:23:40.106 --> 00:23:41.007]  That's leadership.
[00:23:41.527 --> 00:23:47.831]  Admit he was conned, not one-tenth as bad as Trump, and come out and deal with it, and then start saving people!
[00:23:49.622 --> 00:23:53.350]  Because if you were lied to and you're wrong, it's okay to change course.
[00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:58.840]  But then once you learn you're wrong, once you learn you got conned, now you become a party to it.
[00:24:00.106 --> 00:24:01.507]  Now you're aiding and abetting it.
[00:24:02.087 --> 00:24:04.148]  That's why when we're wrong, folks, we're the first to say it.
[00:24:04.408 --> 00:24:05.429]  Alex Jones is not always right.
[00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:11.932]  We try to be right, we have one of the best records of being right, and we're major trailblazers, and have broken tens of thousands of incredible stories.
[00:24:12.452 --> 00:24:20.436]  But we are wrong sometimes, and when we are, we admit to it, because that's all we've got is our credibility, not in front of the public, but in front of God.
[00:24:21.297 --> 00:24:23.238]  That's my audience one.
[00:24:24.824 --> 00:24:29.367]  You know, I'm going to get into human supremacy and what that really means next segment.
[00:24:29.387 --> 00:24:31.087]  It's the longest segment of the hour.
[00:24:31.107 --> 00:24:44.035]  I'm going to hit some other news dealing with the gaslighting and the great reset collapse of the human supporting infrastructure on this planet first and how that ties together with the master plan for the next segment.
[00:24:44.995 --> 00:24:48.457]  But first off, let me just say something here.
[00:24:49.357 --> 00:25:00.600]   I've had friends and family and people on the street Really support us during all this kangaroo court persecution that's going on.
[00:25:02.221 --> 00:25:13.806]  And I have had the staff at the courthouse tell me, almost all of them I walk by and talk to, we appreciate you.
[00:25:13.846 --> 00:25:14.847]  We understand what's happening.
[00:25:15.167 --> 00:25:15.887]  This is wrong.
[00:25:16.268 --> 00:25:16.988]  We're ashamed.
[00:25:18.189 --> 00:25:20.170]  They fist bump us and my crew.
[00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:37.223]   When I go to the little cafe next door, During a break, they give us free food and waitresses kiss us on the cheeks and say, hey, that New York Times reporter came over and asked me if we were drinking alcohol.
[00:25:37.263 --> 00:25:38.124]  I told her you weren't.
[00:25:38.804 --> 00:25:41.325]  I mean, it's like Fight Club where it's on.
[00:25:41.766 --> 00:25:43.366]  I'm at the grocery store yesterday.
[00:25:43.847 --> 00:25:44.847]  Shaked 20 hands.
[00:25:45.327 --> 00:25:46.688]  Probably walked by 50 people.
[00:25:47.248 --> 00:25:49.269]  They all said, we're so sorry for what's happening.
[00:25:49.309 --> 00:25:49.870]  It's wrong.
[00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:51.230]  Keep fighting.
[00:25:51.731 --> 00:25:52.491]  How do you take it?
[00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:56.893]  I had crew members, like a bunch of them coming to my office this morning and hug me.
[00:25:57.794 --> 00:25:59.034]  I had Owen come in here and hug me.
[00:26:01.035 --> 00:26:02.256]  And say a lot of people are praying for us.
[00:26:02.316 --> 00:26:04.357]  And I looked at Owen right before I went on the air today.
[00:26:05.557 --> 00:26:08.902]   And I said, Owen, We knew this was coming.
[00:26:09.302 --> 00:26:10.803]  This is a sign of our success.
[00:26:11.464 --> 00:26:13.785]  What's happening to us is nothing.
[00:26:16.527 --> 00:26:28.696]  In the big picture, you understand they're giving millions of six-month-old babies and up an experimental deadly shot we know destroys their immune system for life and causes cardiovascular problems and sterilization.
[00:26:28.716 --> 00:26:31.078]  I have stacks of news admitting it today, major studies.
[00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:42.932]   What I have nightmares about What stresses me out and what greys my hair is knowing I've got four children in this world and I have a responsibility to fight them.
[00:26:43.653 --> 00:26:45.213]  The globalists try to shut us down.
[00:26:46.194 --> 00:26:48.575]  The globalists try to put me in prison with the January 6th Committee.
[00:26:49.855 --> 00:26:53.857]  The globalists trying to put me on the street.
[00:26:54.037 --> 00:26:56.058]  That means nothing.
[00:26:56.378 --> 00:27:08.433]   I mean, do you understand how much I would love to drive a tractor and shred And bale hay and feed cows and ride horses and live in a trailer?
[00:27:09.314 --> 00:27:16.837]  You know how relaxing it is in a single wide little trailer with your family up on a hill overlooking beautiful oak trees and pine trees?
[00:27:17.837 --> 00:27:25.180]  You know how good it is to climb up on the back of your horse and ride out and check the cattle and check the fences where your ancestors have done it for 200 years?
[00:27:27.581 --> 00:27:29.922]  That's my pain is not being on the ranch.
[00:27:31.543 --> 00:27:36.185]   My pain It's not being with my family and fishing and hiking and hunting.
[00:27:37.086 --> 00:27:38.767]  My pain is seeing innocent people hurt.
[00:27:39.347 --> 00:27:47.554]  My pain is seeing our beautiful world destroyed and taken over by the biochemical, alchemical scientists of the New World Order.
[00:27:48.174 --> 00:27:59.182]  And seeing our fellow humans who've fallen to this demonic evil, snickering and laughing at us like gremlins, because we dare try to save them and save ourselves in the process.
[00:28:00.942 --> 00:28:06.246]  If the New World Order thinks it's getting to me with all these fake lawsuits and rigged courts, they are.
[00:28:07.067 --> 00:28:14.052]  In that it distracts me from the work we're doing here on air and the world-changing things we've done together.
[00:28:14.732 --> 00:28:15.593]  You're not an audience.
[00:28:16.194 --> 00:28:25.741]  You are the energy and you are the arms and legs and guts and blood and bone and mind and eyes and intellect and spirit and soul and will of the pro-human resistance.
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.781]  So I am in anguish.
[00:28:29.081 --> 00:28:29.982]  I am in torture.
[00:28:30.423 --> 00:28:31.364]  I am in pain.
[00:28:32.164 --> 00:28:32.965]  I am upset.
[00:28:33.225 --> 00:28:36.528]  I am having nightmares over the destruction of our species.
[00:28:37.009 --> 00:28:44.035]  Not over the fact that I am trying to fight these people and they know they just kill me outright or put me in prison outright.
[00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:45.757]  That would turn me into a bigger martyr.
[00:28:45.977 --> 00:28:52.904]  So they think setting me against dead kids in a rigged trial of lies where we can't even defend ourselves and where the judge already says we're guilty.
[00:28:53.504 --> 00:29:01.946]  They think that's the only way they can then demonize the archetypal resistor, the archetypal populist who's fighting them.
[00:29:02.406 --> 00:29:08.328]  But the result is the vast majority of people have absolutely seen through it.
[00:29:08.888 --> 00:29:33.208]   So the Democrats and their lawyers and their controlled corrupt judges can sit there and pretend in their little rotting bubbles of the collapsing dinosaur media and the collapsing judiciary and the collapsing economy that they're beating me When I have already made the decision to do this mission, whether I get killed, put in prison, tortured, made homeless, that means nothing to me!
[00:29:34.858 --> 00:29:40.641]  People that love football or basketball or baseball like I did growing up, I would get so upset when my team lost.
[00:29:40.721 --> 00:29:48.966]  I would get so upset when things like... And then finally as I learned about the world and history, I was like, I'm a fool to care about this.
[00:29:49.486 --> 00:29:52.108]  Not that it's bad to watch sports, but it's bad to make it your top thing.
[00:29:52.968 --> 00:30:06.596]   And so when I see unborn children being killed, and six-month-old babies being given experimental shots, and five-year-olds being tricked by public schools that they're really a girl and signing up when they're 10 to have their testicles chopped off, And their penis is cut off.
[00:30:08.477 --> 00:30:12.979]  I take that personally, because I have empathy, because I know it's happening to all of us.
[00:30:13.119 --> 00:30:14.380]  I'm connected to everyone.
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.661]  So if the New World Order wants to hurt me, you have.
[00:30:19.202 --> 00:30:32.649]  And I can see that the horrible things that have been done to me, that I haven't even talked about on air, horrible, horrible things, I'm not a victim, I asked for this, I got in the arena, are hundreds of times worse than taking every dime I've got away.
[00:30:34.398 --> 00:30:37.541]  I don't want to be totally destroyed and not be able to keep our operation going.
[00:30:37.581 --> 00:30:41.765]  I want to keep our great crew employed, and we're doing such great work.
[00:30:42.226 --> 00:30:44.288]  But whatever happens, it's in God's plan.
[00:30:45.849 --> 00:30:49.293]  But I want people to really get their priorities straight right now.
[00:30:50.632 --> 00:30:52.433]  And ask yourselves, what are your priorities?
[00:30:52.473 --> 00:31:05.298]  Because there is a corporate, world government, anti-human, transhumanist, AI takeover happening of the planet right now that sees all of us as obsolete and says that their plan is to get rid of 90% of us at least.
[00:31:06.519 --> 00:31:08.080]  So to me, that's front and center.
[00:31:10.261 --> 00:31:18.444]  If aliens were attacking and blowing up our major cities, would I care if I lost money in the stock market?
[00:31:18.624 --> 00:31:19.365]  And the answer is no.
[00:31:20.339 --> 00:31:21.100]  That's the same thing.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:27.469]  So the people in the system are what I call suicide bankers.
[00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:29.231]  And that happened on 9-11.
[00:31:29.251 --> 00:31:30.013]  We've talked about it a lot.
[00:31:30.053 --> 00:31:30.573]  It's on record.
[00:31:30.613 --> 00:31:30.974]  It happened.
[00:31:31.575 --> 00:31:35.620]  Hundreds of men and women, mainly men, stayed in the towers as they burned smoking.
[00:31:36.536 --> 00:31:42.057]  Because there was such a panic going on, they were making millions of dollars, in some cases, a minute, individually.
[00:31:42.117 --> 00:31:50.159]  Some people, one guy made $45 million while he stayed in the tower for 30 minutes before it collapsed, and his wife got the money, but he died!
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:32:06.082]   Well, I'm not one of these lawyers or bankers or FBI people or media people that That go along with all of this feeling like they're on a winning team.
[00:32:06.362 --> 00:32:08.827]  You're not on a winning team serving the enemy.
[00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:14.914]  I know InfoWars' greatest work is now in hand, but I can't continue to do without your support.
[00:32:14.934 --> 00:32:27.385]  So thank you for your word of mouth, thank you for your prayer, and you should go to InfoWarsTore.com to get really high-quality supplements and products that boost your immune system and make you a healthier, better person and fund our operation.

[00:32:31.869 --> 00:32:33.291]  So does every other major grocery store.
[00:32:33.311 --> 00:32:34.512]  Because they work.
[00:32:35.253 --> 00:32:38.877]  But the point is, is that they're mad that we set up our own economy.
[00:32:39.118 --> 00:32:43.102]  They're so threatened by independent media that's pro-human, having its own infrastructure.
[00:32:43.523 --> 00:32:47.087]  So please continue to support that infrastructure at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:47.728 --> 00:32:49.370]  Bottom Mineral Fusion's back in stock.
[00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:50.732]  Body's back in stock.

[00:33:15.071 --> 00:33:17.996]  If it sells out, they'll book it every day and then it'll spread from there.
[00:33:18.517 --> 00:33:19.679]  All of this is activism.
[00:33:19.799 --> 00:33:23.907]  All of this is the choices you make and what you decide to do in this fight.
[00:33:24.935 --> 00:33:28.558]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:33:29.919 --> 00:33:38.906]  But all God wants from me is that I give it a hundred percent, do the best job I can, and then that will, in God's plan, be part of the larger mission.
[00:33:39.366 --> 00:33:46.212]  And I humbly accept that commission, and your commission as well as yours and listeners, and commit to you that we'll fight harder than we ever have.
[00:33:46.552 --> 00:33:48.394]  But right back with human supremacy.
[00:33:49.955 --> 00:33:54.716]   All right, yesterday, I did a impromptu.
[00:33:56.056 --> 00:33:59.017]  rant about how I'm a human supremacist.
[00:33:59.137 --> 00:34:00.397]  Now I believe in humanity.
[00:34:01.237 --> 00:34:03.437]  And how I love everyone of every race, color, and creed.
[00:34:03.457 --> 00:34:04.998]  We're one race made by God.
[00:34:05.578 --> 00:34:08.238]  Part of a larger plan that God has.
[00:34:08.258 --> 00:34:12.719]  And I read out of Genesis where God says we've been given dominion over the earth.
[00:34:12.799 --> 00:34:18.200]  And if you don't decide you have dominion, someone else is going to decide you're an animal and they have dominion over you.
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.200]  And that's what the globalists say.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.020]  You don't have free will.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:20.940]  You're an animal.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.101]  But they know that's not true.
[00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:24.521]  They want you to subserve your will.
[00:34:25.041 --> 00:34:26.482]  And subserve your destiny to them.
[00:34:27.822 --> 00:34:28.803]  There are some of the headlines.
[00:34:28.843 --> 00:34:29.523]  It's all over the place.
[00:34:29.943 --> 00:34:33.025]  Alex Jones lies himself to Jesus in wild dystopian rant.
[00:34:35.486 --> 00:34:37.587]  Same type article headlines everywhere.
[00:34:39.988 --> 00:34:41.669]  This had nothing to do with court or any of it.
[00:34:42.029 --> 00:34:45.030]  InfoWars host begs judge to drop riot charges.
[00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:47.732]  I don't have any riot charges.
[00:34:48.552 --> 00:34:49.973]  Daily Beast is totally made up.
[00:34:50.553 --> 00:34:51.493]  I'm like Jesus.
[00:34:52.174 --> 00:34:52.354]  What?
[00:34:55.401 --> 00:34:57.842]  Go see the actual speech for yourself on Infowars.com.
[00:34:58.603 --> 00:35:01.924]  Alex Jones, the human supremacist legendary speech.
[00:35:01.944 --> 00:35:02.865]  Hear what I actually said.
[00:35:05.066 --> 00:35:12.029]  And that ties in to this whole transhumanist world that's being established.
[00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:31.251]   But the reason I went into this yesterday, and I'm going to explain more details of it right now, is because There is an organized design collapse of the infrastructure, the globalists admit, to force you onto their new system, they claim will be more sustainable and better, but it's not even a new system, it is extermination.
[00:35:31.832 --> 00:35:32.873]  This is a big deal.
[00:35:33.273 --> 00:35:34.334]  This is the biggest deal.
[00:35:34.654 --> 00:35:35.634]  This is the New World Order.
[00:35:35.915 --> 00:35:37.135]  This is their takeover plan.
[00:35:37.456 --> 00:35:45.221]  This is everything we've warned about, now writ large, now unfolding.
[00:35:47.267 --> 00:35:50.609]  And what prompted me to talk about this was a tweet a few days ago by Elon Musk.
[00:35:51.629 --> 00:35:53.730]  He said, a new philosophy of the future is needed.
[00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:57.432]  I believe it should be curiosity about the universe.
[00:35:58.452 --> 00:36:04.795]  Expanded humanity to become a multi-planet, an interstellar species to see what's out there.
[00:36:05.136 --> 00:36:08.137]  Yes, I totally agree with that statement.
[00:36:12.401 --> 00:36:14.263]  He said, this is compatible with existing religion.
[00:36:14.323 --> 00:36:16.907]  Surely God would want us to see creation.
[00:36:17.327 --> 00:36:18.068]  Yes, exactly.
[00:36:18.128 --> 00:36:20.631]  God built this for us to experience.
[00:36:21.991 --> 00:36:47.525]  God's creation together and the wonderment and the worship of the interface of seeing a pool of fish or dolphins or birds in the sky or a sunset or your baby playing on the ground with blocks or just all the incredible things that life gives us that are so fulfilling that we're designed to love and designed to commune with and designed to be a part of in this continuum.
[00:36:50.461 --> 00:36:57.743]  And if you read Genesis, whether you believe in God or not, or believe this is divinely inspired, it's beautiful.
[00:36:58.283 --> 00:36:59.183]  And it is the truth.
[00:37:02.043 --> 00:37:09.085]  Absolutely important to understand as we read Genesis 26, 27, and 28.
[00:37:09.925 --> 00:37:12.106]  And God said, let us make man in our image.
[00:37:13.406 --> 00:37:14.686]  In their image.
[00:37:15.506 --> 00:37:16.326]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:17.127 --> 00:37:18.327]  It says it right here, folks.
[00:37:19.372 --> 00:37:21.373]  And God, the preachers don't want you to know what's being said here.
[00:37:21.733 --> 00:37:33.376]  And God said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth.
[00:37:33.776 --> 00:37:34.557]  What are they taking away?
[00:37:34.597 --> 00:37:35.497]  Our dominion over all of it.
[00:37:36.137 --> 00:37:38.598]  And over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
[00:37:41.179 --> 00:37:38.598]  27.
[00:37:41.239 --> 00:37:44.920]  So God created man in his own image, and the image of God created him.
[00:37:48.311 --> 00:37:51.394]  Male and female created.
[00:37:52.174 --> 00:37:52.555]  He, them.
[00:37:52.575 --> 00:37:52.555]  28.
[00:37:52.595 --> 00:37:54.997]  And God blessed them.
[00:37:55.657 --> 00:37:57.279]  His backing, his support, his commission.
[00:37:57.639 --> 00:38:03.744]  And God said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it.
[00:38:04.025 --> 00:38:04.985]  What's Elon Musk doing?
[00:38:05.346 --> 00:38:06.206]  He's got like 10 children.
[00:38:08.048 --> 00:38:14.774]  And have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over everything that moveth upon the earth.
[00:38:18.502 --> 00:38:27.947]  And God said, behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth.
[00:38:28.087 --> 00:38:28.607]  Gave it to us.
[00:38:28.627 --> 00:38:29.808]  Incredible technology.
[00:38:30.568 --> 00:38:34.450]  And every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed.
[00:38:36.331 --> 00:38:38.112]  If you, it shall be for meat.
[00:38:41.453 --> 00:38:42.414]  And it goes on from there.
[00:38:45.285 --> 00:38:55.070]  Verse 30, And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat.
[00:38:55.771 --> 00:38:56.471]  And it was so.
[00:38:57.912 --> 00:39:00.133]  The plants create the meat, feed the meat.
[00:39:00.994 --> 00:39:05.836]  And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good.
[00:39:05.856 --> 00:39:10.439]  And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:21.241]  And the seventh day is to rest and contemplate this cathedral, this beautiful spaceship that God made for us.
[00:39:21.941 --> 00:39:29.603]  That is our launch pad, our springboard, our portal into the wider universe and beyond.
[00:39:31.103 --> 00:39:33.403]  Infinity and beyond, Buzz Lightyear says.
[00:39:35.323 --> 00:39:53.908]   And then when you study everything the New World Order does, it is in countervention, it is 100% countervailing, Everything that's wholesome and good, that works, that regenerates, that is beautiful, and that is in communion with the Creator.
[00:39:55.128 --> 00:39:56.669]  We were made to worship.
[00:39:56.949 --> 00:39:58.850]  That doesn't mean like a slave on your knees.
[00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:00.730]  We were made to interface.
[00:40:01.931 --> 00:40:03.271]  God, the groom.
[00:40:04.652 --> 00:40:06.033]  Humanity, the bride.
[00:40:07.793 --> 00:40:08.333]  Babies.
[00:40:09.334 --> 00:40:10.434]  Given the universe.
[00:40:11.975 --> 00:40:17.857]   Given the little box of toys and Blocks to play and build.
[00:40:19.778 --> 00:40:49.082]   And there are those that know that, who don't want us to become what we really are, who want to end it, and tell us we're bad, and tell us we're ugly, and tell us, oh no, the human age is over, says Hurari of the WEF, who gives his book away for free, hoping it'd be number one in history, but The Great Reset by Alex Jones is number one, and will soon be number one total, in the world, Because the people hunger for truth.
[00:40:50.625 --> 00:41:03.333]   And in the book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, I lay out The entire history of this and the two different countervailing forces.
[00:41:03.853 --> 00:41:05.754]  Those that want you to decide you have no free will.
[00:41:06.195 --> 00:41:07.675]  Those that want you to decide you're an animal.
[00:41:08.136 --> 00:41:14.359]  Those that want you to step down out of your position and let them rule over you and take the position of God.
[00:41:14.779 --> 00:41:21.482]  They tell you there's no God because they want to place themselves in that tabernacle.
[00:41:23.503 --> 00:41:24.544]  In that holy of holies.
[00:41:27.537 --> 00:41:41.348]  They want to tell you you've got to go through them for ascension, and to transcend, you've got to give up your humanity and sign over your will and every action to them, and then they will fulfill you.
[00:41:41.588 --> 00:41:43.049]  But all they do is destroy.
[00:41:43.089 --> 00:41:47.172]  And Christ said, you will know a tree by its fruits.
[00:41:47.653 --> 00:41:52.536]  And you look at the fruits of the new world order, their death, their misery, their poverty, their disease, they are poison.
[00:41:53.476 --> 00:41:58.278]  The gifts of God, the natural order, is ascendance, completion.
[00:42:00.779 --> 00:42:14.845]  Beyond ecstasy, the feeling of total rest, total completion, absolute understanding, interfacing with God for eternity, and watching the children pray.
[00:42:16.786 --> 00:42:31.786]   And one day we will be there at the next level and the host of God and see the great plan from even a greater position
[00:42:31.786 --> 00:42:32.786]  of discernment.
[00:42:33.007 --> 00:42:36.009]  We'll watch the children grow and watch the children pray.
[00:42:36.729 --> 00:42:52.758]  We will watch the children become what they choose to become and our great pain will be that our Father gave them the ability to live forever, the ability to transcend, the ability to touch the divine and instead they chose death.
[00:42:54.992 --> 00:42:56.854]  And that is always the great question of God.
[00:42:58.135 --> 00:43:01.898]  Was it a crime to give you free will and allow some of you to fall?
[00:43:02.118 --> 00:43:03.159]  But we all know it wasn't.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.441]  And that was God's decision.
[00:43:04.661 --> 00:43:05.401]  And it was perfect.
[00:43:05.562 --> 00:43:07.563]  And we thank God for the gift of consciousness.
[00:43:08.024 --> 00:43:09.705]  We thank God for this great choice.
[00:43:09.885 --> 00:43:12.368]  And we understand how absolutely perfect it is.
[00:43:12.608 --> 00:43:19.174]  And we get on our knees with pleasure and ask God to take us to the next level.
[00:43:20.421 --> 00:43:30.283]  So all this trifling and petty garbage and systems of men working against God are nothing and have fallen.
[00:43:31.544 --> 00:43:33.664]  Get The Great Reset Book at infowarestore.com.

[00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:13.591]  We have come so far together.
[00:44:14.191 --> 00:44:15.752]  Please help keep us on the air.
[00:44:15.932 --> 00:44:17.433]  We're under massive attack right now.
[00:44:17.833 --> 00:44:19.414]  But we're going to win with your help.
[00:44:19.454 --> 00:44:22.196]  We're going to overcome this with your help and with God's blessing.
[00:44:22.636 --> 00:44:25.518]  Please go to InfoWarsTour.com and get this book.
[00:44:26.099 --> 00:44:28.180]  Many, many, many years of research have gone into this.
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:30.562]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:44:30.962 --> 00:44:33.824]  Available right now at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:44:33.964 --> 00:44:36.466]  There's also signed copies available as well.
[00:44:37.346 --> 00:44:46.612]  We got a lot of other big projects we're working on that are about to start launching as well, but this is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because it warns the world of the globalist plan.
[00:44:47.052 --> 00:44:49.093]  Get The Great Reset at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:44:49.774 --> 00:44:58.379]  After being deleted by YouTube and social media in 2018, most people did nothing to defend Alex Jones or InfoWars.
[00:44:58.979 --> 00:45:06.064]  Instead, they obediently learned the new rules and rationalized their submission as a necessary evil.
[00:45:06.864 --> 00:45:10.006]  As a result, things have only gotten worse for everyone.
[00:45:10.507 --> 00:45:13.729]  And without any recourse, they are about to get much worse.
[00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:24.577]  Alex Jones is now patient zero for America's new de facto justice system, brought to you by the fear, complacency, and inaction of the people.
[00:45:25.057 --> 00:45:28.940]  Because we take it, here's how we can all expect to now be treated.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:46.068]  Even though Jones never mentioned their name and the parents never sought a retraction, Alex Jones is being sued for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress by parents of children who were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
[00:45:46.688 --> 00:45:59.691]  The rest of the plaintiffs are federal agents, and the legal team is comprised of highly politicized members of the anti-gun lobby, who have admitted their intention is to silence Alex Jones.
[00:46:00.471 --> 00:46:12.354]  So with this new precedent, if you dare question the official narrative, say for example, the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, then someone can sue you into oblivion for emotional distress.
[00:46:12.934 --> 00:46:13.954]  But it only gets worse.
[00:46:14.634 --> 00:46:23.320]  The plaintiffs claim that Alex Jones was the perpetrator of the Sandy Hook Crisis Actor Conspiracy Theory, which is demonstrably false.
[00:46:23.841 --> 00:46:36.190]  After all the censorship and deleted videos, one can still find hours and hours of video content compiled from hundreds of sources, all questioning the official narrative of Sandy Hook.
[00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:42.075]  It was arguably the most discussed conspiracy theory since 9-11.
[00:46:42.735 --> 00:46:48.280]  And over the course of seven years, Alex Jones spent less than 30 minutes discussing it.
[00:46:48.841 --> 00:46:51.804]  We know this because it's all part of the public record.
[00:46:52.164 --> 00:46:55.387]  But these radical judges do not care about evidence.
[00:46:55.687 --> 00:46:59.170]  I am not currently representing Alex Jones, so I am free to speak my mind.
[00:47:00.672 --> 00:47:07.838]  They're already, apparently I've heard, that the plaintiff's lawyers are complaining about me speaking out about the case.
[00:47:07.998 --> 00:47:10.581]  That's how corrupt these plaintiff's lawyers are.
[00:47:10.681 --> 00:47:17.667]  They're political hacks standing on the bodies of dead kids to line their pockets and take away other people's political rights.
[00:47:17.987 --> 00:47:19.989]  And I find it disgusting what they've done.
[00:47:20.009 --> 00:47:25.254]   And so, but in this particular context, Jones has produced more discovery than anybody.
[00:47:25.474 --> 00:47:29.278]  I can't find anyone that produced more discovery than he is, and yet they pretended that he didn't.
[00:47:29.598 --> 00:47:29.959]  Why?
[00:47:30.619 --> 00:47:33.322]  Because they built their whole case on a big lie.
[00:47:33.682 --> 00:47:43.952]  Both Judge Gamble in Texas and Judge Bellis in Connecticut have found Alex Jones guilty without ever holding a trial or hearing any evidence.
[00:47:44.372 --> 00:47:51.258]  Which is worse treatment than anyone has ever gotten in America, including Charles Manson and Al Capone.
[00:47:51.819 --> 00:48:01.468]  And their excuse for this abomination of justice is they claim that Jones failed to provide them with the incriminating evidence that they imagine must exist.
[00:48:02.208 --> 00:48:12.657]   Whatever that mysterious unspecified evidence is, Both judges have stripped Jones of his First Amendment right, but Judge Gamble has gone much further.
[00:48:13.277 --> 00:48:20.882]  Judge Maya Gamble comes from CPS, who has been exposed for human trafficking and working with pedophiles.
[00:48:21.403 --> 00:48:32.711]  Gamble helped publish CPS propaganda, praising the state's authority and advising parents that it's normal for their children to lie about being abused in foster care.
[00:48:33.511 --> 00:48:44.981]  In the Alex Jones case, Judge Gamble has ordered that the words First Amendment and free speech cannot be used by Alex Jones, his witnesses, or even his lawyers.
[00:48:45.701 --> 00:48:47.643]  He is not allowed to defend himself.
[00:48:48.364 --> 00:48:56.571]  Judge Gamble has instructed that the jury is not allowed to hear about the emotional trauma caused by the mass murderer who killed the children.
[00:48:57.271 --> 00:49:02.374]  They are only allowed to hear how their trauma was caused by the words of Alex Jones.
[00:49:03.275 --> 00:49:11.180]  And during jury selection, not a single juror thought the media has ever treated Alex Jones or InfoWars unfairly.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:19.265]  And any juror who questioned the $100 million amount casually discussed by the plaintiff's lawyers were kicked off the jury.
[00:49:20.499 --> 00:49:26.422]  Alex Jones was cancelled from social media in 2018, and is now being cancelled from the U.S.
[00:49:26.462 --> 00:49:28.382]  Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:49:29.163 --> 00:49:32.384]  And because of our complacency, everyone else is next.
[00:49:33.124 --> 00:49:39.627]  And in case you were wondering, the way we used to do justice was a thing called innocent until proven guilty.
[00:49:40.287 --> 00:49:43.769]  It relied upon the burden of proof, and it was pretty good.
[00:49:45.006 --> 00:49:47.126]  We are now into hour number two.
[00:49:47.146 --> 00:49:48.787]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:49:49.627 --> 00:49:58.129]  Let's go to some of the insane, purposeful, worldwide shutdown of economies to bring us to our knees.
[00:49:59.609 --> 00:50:16.264]   Here are some excerpts of Joe Biden saying in the last day that we are not in a recession despite the fact the exact definition of recession is two consecutive quarters With negative growth.
[00:50:18.105 --> 00:50:22.728]  And we are at negative growth for more than two quarters.
[00:50:23.409 --> 00:50:25.030]  Of course, this is far beyond a recession.
[00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:31.674]  This is an economic implosion, getting the workforce to give up, destroying small businesses and infrastructure for the Great Reset.
[00:50:32.275 --> 00:50:36.197]  But towards the end, in another clip, he admits this is a great transition we're in.
[00:50:36.738 --> 00:50:37.118]  Here it is.
[00:50:38.888 --> 00:50:51.073]  Both Chairman Powell and many of the significant banking personnel and economists say we're not in a recession.
[00:50:52.353 --> 00:50:54.014]  That doesn't sound like a recession to me.
[00:50:54.154 --> 00:50:54.834]  Thank you very much.
[00:50:57.489 --> 00:51:01.733]  How confident are you that we're not heading towards a recession?
[00:51:02.353 --> 00:51:12.223]  And how we transition from a historic economic recovery to a stable steady growth and lower inflation without letting go of all the historic gains we've made over the last 18 months.
[00:51:13.314 --> 00:51:28.478]  Right now, there are an enormous set of global headwinds, including a war in Europe and successive variants of the pandemic, but our economy remains resilient.
[00:51:29.738 --> 00:51:39.537]   So, they shut down the economy, they implode the third world, they starve 60-plus million people to death, they go, well, despite the virus we released, And our economic warfare against you.
[00:51:39.577 --> 00:51:40.499]  We're strong.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:44.487]  So while they crush you, while they destroy you, they tell you it's not happening.
[00:51:44.848 --> 00:51:48.755]  Here's the so-called White House Press Secretary gaslighting folks further.
[00:51:50.725 --> 00:51:51.546]  The D.C.
[00:51:51.606 --> 00:51:59.629]  Mayor sent the White House a letter asking for National Guard help with migrants that have been bused here from Texas and Arizona.
[00:51:59.689 --> 00:52:02.370]  Is the President going to approve that request for the National Guard?
[00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:06.752]  So, to your question on the National Guard, I refer you to the Department of Defense.
[00:52:06.952 --> 00:52:09.153]  They will have that answer for you.
[00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:12.174]  We have been in regular touch with Mayor Bowser and her team.
[00:52:12.955 --> 00:52:18.557]  And I said this before, I said this last week about Republicans using migrants as a political tool.
[00:52:19.097 --> 00:52:23.079]  Okay, so let's just stop here, because I was going to get to this clip later.
[00:52:22.919 --> 00:52:25.758]  in place for managing migrants at the border.
[00:52:25.758 --> 00:52:28.699]  This is not it, what they're doing currently.
[00:52:28.699 --> 00:52:34.799]   That includes expelling migrants as required by court order under Title 42, transferring
[00:52:34.799 --> 00:52:42.118]   them to ICE custody, or placing them in the care of local NGOs as they await further processing
[00:52:42.118 --> 00:52:43.118]  against.
[00:52:43.118 --> 00:52:46.379]   Okay, so let's just stop here because I was going to get to this clip later.
[00:52:46.379 --> 00:52:51.798]   We played a different club, which is her gaslighting as well, saying the Republicans are flooding
[00:52:51.798 --> 00:52:56.439]   the border, the Republicans are bad, and the Democrat cities don't want Texas and Florida
[00:52:56.439 --> 00:52:58.678]  to bus the illegals to their cities.
[00:52:58.678 --> 00:53:07.278]   So that's more gaslighting, but the clip I wanted from her was the clip.
[00:53:07.325 --> 00:53:14.628]  Dealing with her also denying that we're in a recession, but we know they're all doing that so we don't really need to play the club for you.
[00:53:14.928 --> 00:53:19.690]  They're all saying that we are not in a recession, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:25.472]  And the open borders are the Republicans' fault and they don't want people bused to their cities.
[00:53:25.812 --> 00:53:28.153]  They want them in your towns.
[00:53:33.123 --> 00:53:37.408]  And it just goes on and on and on from there.
[00:53:42.274 --> 00:53:49.002]  You know, I, just at this point, don't know how much more we can take.
[00:53:51.485 --> 00:53:53.485]  I mean this really is 1984.
[00:53:53.485 --> 00:54:00.923]  And...
[00:54:00.923 --> 00:54:04.525]  Where do these people think they're gonna live?
[00:54:04.212 --> 00:54:07.273]  How do they think they're going to be doing during the destruction of civilization?
[00:54:07.693 --> 00:54:10.194]  How do they think wrecking everything is going to make it better for them?
[00:54:10.294 --> 00:54:25.179]  But they have this, they have this instinct, they have this drive that if they can just dominate and hurt people, somehow that makes them more powerful.
[00:54:26.799 --> 00:54:31.401]  And for me, it's extremely sad and frustrating.
[00:54:35.987 --> 00:54:44.134]  But we're entering a period of total destruction and war and collapse by design.
[00:54:45.135 --> 00:54:51.882]  And I really feel sorry for the average person out there that still doesn't know what they've been hit by and just how intense this is going to get.
[00:54:51.902 --> 00:54:57.327]  I mean, really, that's what this comes down to.
[00:54:59.148 --> 00:55:05.679]   Think about The fact that we have Fauci and Burks and all of them on TV.
[00:55:05.699 --> 00:55:06.740]  We played the clubs many times.
[00:55:08.181 --> 00:55:08.881]  Should I play them again?
[00:55:08.901 --> 00:55:11.603]  Saying, oh, we knew the shot wouldn't work.
[00:55:13.084 --> 00:55:13.844]  Well, we knew that too.
[00:55:13.884 --> 00:55:14.325]  We told you.
[00:55:15.866 --> 00:55:17.127]  And then they censored everybody.
[00:55:19.488 --> 00:55:22.090]  So that information couldn't and wouldn't get out.
[00:55:23.551 --> 00:55:30.416]  And then now they say, but don't worry, we've got a new super shot that's going to fix all your problems as well.
[00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:36.833]  They are tightening the noose around our necks.
[00:55:36.873 --> 00:55:38.154]  Let's play clip 10.
[00:55:39.355 --> 00:55:44.178]  Here are two minutes of Democrats lying about inflation.
[00:55:45.019 --> 00:55:49.762]  I really doubt that we're going to see an inflationary cycle.
[00:55:49.782 --> 00:55:54.065]  Most economic analysts believe that it will have a temporary or transitory impact.
[00:55:54.145 --> 00:55:57.587]  A faster than expected increase in some of those prices is actually a good sign.
[00:55:57.767 --> 00:56:01.210]  Overwhelming consensus is going to pop up a little bit and then go back down.
[00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:05.393]  No one's talking about this great, great deal.
[00:56:05.673 --> 00:56:08.655]  This is something that will settle down.
[00:56:08.996 --> 00:56:09.576]  Transitory.
[00:56:09.976 --> 00:56:10.617]  Transitory.
[00:56:10.697 --> 00:56:17.462]  And the data shows that most of the price increases we've seen were expected and are expected to be temporary.
[00:56:17.542 --> 00:56:20.785]  There's nobody suggesting there's unchecked inflation on the way.
[00:56:20.845 --> 00:56:21.125]  It's on.
[00:56:21.305 --> 00:56:25.587]  It's highly unlikely that it's going to be long-term inflation that's going to get out of hand.
[00:56:25.768 --> 00:56:28.929]  I don't know anybody who's worried about inflation.
[00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:33.252]  Over the last couple of months, we actually saw it trended downward.
[00:56:33.292 --> 00:56:44.378]  President Biden's chief of staff, Ron Klain, enthusiastically retweeted an economist who had said, in part, most of the economic problems we're facing, inflation, supply chains, etc., are high-class problems.
[00:56:44.598 --> 00:56:49.881]  What is the Granholm plan to increase oil production in America?
[00:56:52.883 --> 00:56:53.884]  That is hilarious.
[00:56:54.064 --> 00:56:58.347]  Well, the number one thing that the president can do is help get COVID under control.
[00:56:59.187 --> 00:57:01.689]  That we know is the root cause of inflation.
[00:57:01.849 --> 00:57:07.772]  President Biden this afternoon saying he thinks we're at the peak of the crisis right now and that lower prices are on the way.
[00:57:07.792 --> 00:57:10.634]  The inflation has everything to do with the supply chain.
[00:57:11.054 --> 00:57:13.576]  Make no mistake, inflation is largely the fault of Putin.
[00:57:13.616 --> 00:57:16.999]  I'm going to do everything I can to minimize Putin's price hike here at home.
[00:57:17.279 --> 00:57:24.184]  If you want to get rid of inflation, the only way to do it is to undo a lot of the Trump tax cuts.
[00:57:24.264 --> 00:57:26.626]  Ever since you've come into office, things are really looking up.
[00:57:27.166 --> 00:57:29.408]  You know, gas is up, rent is up, food is up.
[00:57:30.509 --> 00:57:30.909]  Everything.
[00:57:34.612 --> 00:57:39.876]  The mayor of New York says they are in a complete and total collapse.
[00:57:41.536 --> 00:57:42.957]  The video's on Infowars.com.
[00:57:43.498 --> 00:57:44.619]  Wall Street's collapsing.
[00:57:44.639 --> 00:57:52.205]  New York City Mayor says, quote, we're in a financial crisis like you can never imagine.
[00:57:52.245 --> 00:57:53.366]  Wall Street is collapsing.
[00:57:53.826 --> 00:57:54.727]  We're in a recession.
[00:57:55.427 --> 00:58:03.193]  Adam said New York event hosted by nonprofit project Hospitality is cited by the news outlets.
[00:58:03.714 --> 00:58:06.236]  And it goes through what he had to say about that.
[00:58:06.716 --> 00:58:09.839]  So they can't even get their propaganda straight.
[00:58:11.018 --> 00:58:19.340]  And the reason they want shows like this one off is they don't want us to show you clips of them a few years ago versus now, or even a month ago versus now.
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:23.682]  Here's one of Deborah Birx, again, who now admits the vaccine doesn't work.
[00:58:24.842 --> 00:58:26.602]  And it was all a fraud and they knew it didn't work.
[00:58:27.122 --> 00:58:29.023]  Wow, that's the mission of criminal fraud.
[00:58:29.283 --> 00:58:30.643]  They've made hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:58:30.944 --> 00:58:32.204]  They poisoned a bunch of people.
[00:58:32.804 --> 00:58:34.244]  And now they've got more shots coming out.
[00:58:34.605 --> 00:58:36.065]  We'll play this clip and come back from break.
[00:58:36.701 --> 00:58:42.725]  To truly achieve herd immunity is going to take through the summer and potentially even into the fall.
[00:58:43.105 --> 00:58:47.248]  That's getting, you know, 80, 70, 80% of Americans immunized.
[00:58:47.428 --> 00:58:50.410]  I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection.
[00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:58.776]  And I think we overplayed the vaccines and it made people then worry that it's not going to protect against severe disease and hospitalization.
[00:58:58.916 --> 00:59:00.837]  It will, but let's be very clear.
[00:59:00.857 --> 00:59:06.301]  50% of the people who died from the Omicron surge were older, vaccinated.
[00:59:08.422 --> 00:59:13.767]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Friday edition.
[00:59:15.548 --> 00:59:20.952]  And I'm just here looking at the news and watching what's unfolding and it's just totally insane.
[00:59:21.413 --> 00:59:23.895]  They declared a worldwide UN emergency.
[00:59:24.435 --> 00:59:32.582]  They're talking about new lockdowns for monkeypox that they admit have not killed one person and is 99% in homosexual men.
[00:59:37.028 --> 00:59:40.469]  So that's the backdrop of what we've got going on here.
[00:59:42.029 --> 00:59:54.211]  And we've got mad scientists in government and corporate labs all over the world in an insane race to find new technologies that are all extremely dangerous.
[00:59:55.051 --> 01:00:01.912]  So everybody knows the parable, the legend of Atlantis, whether it's real or not, is up for debate.
[01:00:01.992 --> 01:00:04.833]  But we've built the new Atlantis, and I've talked about this a lot.
[01:00:07.048 --> 01:00:16.877]  And because people aren't governing themselves and aren't thinking about what they're doing because they've lost their morals or never had them, they're just doing every horrible thing you can imagine.
[01:00:17.257 --> 01:00:31.810]  Creating new microbes that aren't even made of plants or animals or insects that are just completely generated by computers that could easily get out and spread and take over the planet like the Andromeda strain.
[01:00:32.864 --> 01:00:40.569]  And then what I mentioned earlier in the first hour, yes, scientists turned dead spiders into gripping claws.
[01:00:42.010 --> 01:00:49.054]  Scientists have repurposed dead spiders into a device capable of picking up and moving small objects.
[01:00:49.874 --> 01:00:59.260]  It is heralded as the first step in neurobotics, or necrobotics, or the combination of a corpse and robotics.
[01:01:01.521 --> 01:01:11.033]   It all began When members of the Daniel Preston Medical Engineering Lab in Rice University, that's Texas, came across a dead spider.
[01:01:11.693 --> 01:01:14.194]  They wondered why the legs are always curled up.
[01:01:14.714 --> 01:01:28.997]  When the students learned the mechanism involved in the system, a way to manipulate it in a lab setting, apparently these are the kinds of fun hijinks medical engineers get up to when they should be cleaning the lab.
[01:01:29.338 --> 01:01:30.698]  They just make a big joke about it.
[01:01:33.871 --> 01:01:36.912]  But imagine what's really going on.
[01:01:39.392 --> 01:01:46.494]  And imagine what this nanotech in these shots are doing to humanity.
[01:01:46.314 --> 01:01:55.314]   I want to play a short clip from CBS News where they talk about the necrobots, the zombie
[01:01:55.314 --> 01:01:59.314]  cyborg robot spiders.
[01:01:59.314 --> 01:02:26.314]  [Music]
[01:02:26.233 --> 01:02:32.160]   A hundred times It's white.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:40.679]   And when you see what scientists are doing, they're doing this to humans.
[01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:45.916]  They're treating us like we're nothing more than lab rats.
[01:02:46.777 --> 01:02:47.538]  Now getting back.
[01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:50.373]  To Monkeypox.
[01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:54.956]  If you don't have some fun with this, you're gonna go crazy.
[01:02:55.016 --> 01:02:55.637]  I know I am.
[01:02:56.197 --> 01:02:57.538]  So we should have some fun with it.
[01:02:57.878 --> 01:02:59.319]  Tucker Carlson had a vote.
[01:02:59.819 --> 01:03:02.721]  They have a new name for Monkeypox.
[01:03:03.642 --> 01:03:04.603]  Where it's coming from.
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:07.261]  Now even though the U.N.
[01:03:07.301 --> 01:03:20.989]  said, I don't need to listen to them, it's true, 99% of the monkeypox cases around the world are homosexual men that are having multiple partners a day with hundreds of people every few months, and they're just absolutely giving each other every disease known to man.
[01:03:24.611 --> 01:03:28.193]  And so now Tucker Carlson has developed a new name for the monkeypox.
[01:03:32.967 --> 01:03:35.650]  So Monkeypox is about the coolest name ever for a disease.
[01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:37.032]  Can't come tonight, I got the monkey.
[01:03:37.753 --> 01:03:41.177]  But they are changing the name because racism or something.
[01:03:41.217 --> 01:03:42.599]  Well, for once, we don't know who they are.
[01:03:42.639 --> 01:03:43.500]  We're not going to allow it.
[01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:45.062]  We're going to change the name this time.
[01:03:45.082 --> 01:03:47.645]  We're going to do it with the public's help because democracy is real.
[01:03:47.665 --> 01:03:48.205]  So we had a vote.
[01:03:49.002 --> 01:03:50.123]  There was no ballot harvesting.
[01:03:50.584 --> 01:03:52.486]  You can trust our counting.
[01:03:52.806 --> 01:03:57.131]  And the new name for monkey pox is now officially, and we're declaring it, schlong COVID.
[01:03:57.831 --> 01:04:00.674]  That won our audience election with about 40% of the vote.
[01:04:00.694 --> 01:04:02.756]  So let Rochelle Walensky at the CDC know.
[01:04:03.157 --> 01:04:04.218]  Her number is 1-800-232-4636.
[01:04:04.959 --> 01:04:11.466]  Wait for the prompt on monkey pox and make your voice heard, because it's still a democracy.
[01:04:12.529 --> 01:04:14.830]  Now, we've taken shots at Eric Swalwell over the years.
[01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:17.091]  And to be fair, we want him to come on and respond.
[01:04:17.131 --> 01:04:17.811]  He will never come on.
[01:04:17.851 --> 01:04:18.551]  He's too busy.
[01:04:18.591 --> 01:04:19.111]  What's he doing?
[01:04:19.151 --> 01:04:19.711]  We don't know.
[01:04:19.771 --> 01:04:20.912]  But we just got this picture in.
[01:04:20.972 --> 01:04:22.432]  We think it's actually Eric Swalwell.
[01:04:22.452 --> 01:04:23.453]  We don't know who he's talking to.
[01:04:23.513 --> 01:04:23.893]  Fang-fang.
[01:04:23.973 --> 01:04:24.593]  We don't know.
[01:04:25.894 --> 01:04:26.654]  But he's clearly busy.
[01:04:27.154 --> 01:04:30.055]  So maybe that's why he's not accepting our offers to come on.
[01:04:29.875 --> 01:04:34.474]   But if he can break away and spend the time, he's always welcome on this show.
[01:04:34.474 --> 01:04:36.914]  Shlong COVID.
[01:04:36.914 --> 01:04:44.434]   Tucker Carlson, slandered over a homophobic name for new monkeypox.
[01:04:44.917 --> 01:04:45.617]  It's cruel!
[01:04:47.378 --> 01:04:52.901]  No, it's cruel to have hundreds of sexual partners unprotected and spread diseases.
[01:04:52.961 --> 01:04:56.382]  I don't care whether you're heterosexual or homosexual.
[01:04:56.983 --> 01:04:58.403]  That is the reality here.
[01:05:00.124 --> 01:05:02.906]  But we're certainly not following God's plan.
[01:05:04.466 --> 01:05:07.328]  That's the thing that's really clear here.
[01:05:09.111 --> 01:05:11.612]  And we're marching towards thermonuclear war.
[01:05:13.252 --> 01:05:15.492]  We're abandoning all the things that made us great.
[01:05:15.532 --> 01:05:24.354]  We are letting corrupt corporations control our governments and annihilate our free speech, our due process, our privacy.
[01:05:24.374 --> 01:05:27.195]  And they're just getting started.
[01:05:27.535 --> 01:05:35.496]  And I got to tell you, the Republican leadership is almost completely mum on all of this.
[01:05:35.536 --> 01:05:37.777]  They're not talking about the issues that are real.
[01:05:38.936 --> 01:05:42.260]  And the issues that energize the general public.
[01:05:43.341 --> 01:05:43.802]  And I get it.
[01:05:44.222 --> 01:05:46.024]  They've got into Congress, they want to keep their head down.
[01:05:46.405 --> 01:05:50.269]  You stick your head up too high, well you know what happened to Alex Jones.
[01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:53.993]  But if everybody cowers, we all get destroyed.
[01:05:54.654 --> 01:06:02.325]   So you can sit there and look at people that stick their heads up and Try to fix society and say, well, maybe I shouldn't do that.
[01:06:02.905 --> 01:06:04.066]  I'm just going to play it safe.
[01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:09.829]  But when everybody plays it safe, we have stagnation and collapse of civilization.
[01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:12.230]  But Trump is really starting to get it.
[01:06:12.270 --> 01:06:25.138]   If he'll just come out against the shots, like Bolsonaro did, and admit he was conned with what Birx and others have admitted, We can all get behind Trump again, but I like what he's doing.
[01:06:25.178 --> 01:06:30.281]  We'll talk about it when we come back on the other side of this Live Friday Worldwide Broadcast.
[01:06:30.941 --> 01:06:35.764]  And Robert Barnes is coming in to co-host with me in the third and fourth hour today.
[01:06:35.784 --> 01:06:38.066]  Infowars.com.
[01:06:39.466 --> 01:06:49.012]  Tomorrow's News Today and Bandot Video with not just our content, but hundreds of other band creators with incredible information at Bandot Video.
[01:06:49.292 --> 01:06:50.073]  Please share that link.
[01:06:54.161 --> 01:06:56.964]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[01:06:57.064 --> 01:06:58.145]  Let me think, just let me think.
[01:06:58.165 --> 01:07:03.690]  I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will still be on their way.
[01:07:03.731 --> 01:07:05.132]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[01:07:05.192 --> 01:07:05.753]  Damn it!
[01:07:05.793 --> 01:07:06.293]  Why?
[01:07:06.834 --> 01:07:13.420]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:16.303]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:24.172]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[01:07:24.212 --> 01:07:25.172]  You decided, sir.
[01:07:25.232 --> 01:07:26.132]  You wanted it foolproof.
[01:07:26.152 --> 01:07:27.613]  You taught me every television in London!
[01:07:27.833 --> 01:07:31.334]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[01:07:31.734 --> 01:07:41.837]  And where once you had the freedom to object, think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[01:07:42.577 --> 01:07:43.978]  How did this happen?
[01:07:44.038 --> 01:07:44.778]  Who's to blame?
[01:07:45.739 --> 01:07:48.463]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[01:07:48.803 --> 01:07:50.346]  They will be held accountable.
[01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:56.235]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[01:07:57.424 --> 01:07:59.205]  I know why you did it.
[01:07:59.405 --> 01:08:01.665]  I know you were afraid, cahooting me.
[01:08:02.146 --> 01:08:04.226]  War, terror, disease.
[01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:11.189]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[01:08:11.269 --> 01:08:17.611]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[01:08:17.471 --> 01:08:24.471]   He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[01:08:24.471 --> 01:08:32.471]  There is a war.
[01:08:32.237 --> 01:08:33.278]  It's happening now.
[01:08:34.098 --> 01:08:35.899]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.341]  The time to choose sides has come.
[01:08:39.101 --> 01:08:40.582]  We are the resistance.
[01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.783]  We are the InfoWar.
[01:08:42.783 --> 01:08:48.783]  [Music]
[01:08:48.783 --> 01:08:54.783]   The biggest thing we can all do is recognize a bunch of fellow humans have joined the evil
[01:08:54.783 --> 01:08:59.783]   and decided to play God and try to take all our basic rights away and enslave us.
[01:09:00.056 --> 01:09:20.109]  An example is, I was reading the news during the break about the show trial here in Austin, the first of three, two in Austin, one in Connecticut, and they had their media expert, the former editor of the Austin American Statesman, a guy that hates me on, and when my lawyer got up to cross-examine, judge wouldn't even let him ask questions.
[01:09:21.721 --> 01:09:23.001]  And said, you can't get into this stuff.
[01:09:24.102 --> 01:09:26.223]  Oh, Jones isn't a journalist.
[01:09:26.663 --> 01:09:28.763]  Jones hurt people with things he said.
[01:09:29.063 --> 01:09:29.884]  Really, how'd he hurt them?
[01:09:30.224 --> 01:09:31.444]  Oh, you can't ask that question.
[01:09:32.165 --> 01:09:35.926]  Just like Steve Bannon's criminal trial that falsely convicted him in a D.C.
[01:09:35.946 --> 01:09:36.726]  jury two weeks ago.
[01:09:36.826 --> 01:09:39.427]  And this is the model for everybody.
[01:09:40.407 --> 01:09:44.909]  They are fully weaponizing the lawyers and the judiciary against the American people.
[01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:48.170]  But their whole system's coming down.
[01:09:49.608 --> 01:09:57.590]  And as long as we identify what they're doing, and as long as we expose what they're doing, they will never get away with their endgame.
[01:09:57.630 --> 01:10:10.774]  They will destroy themselves in the process, and all the numbers, and all the statistics, and all the polls, and the history, and common sense, absolutely 110% document that.
[01:10:13.174 --> 01:10:18.576]  But they're making their move against humanity in a big, big way right now.
[01:10:21.004 --> 01:10:24.445]  And this is just the process that we're going to have to go through.
[01:10:24.625 --> 01:10:25.345]  Here's an example.
[01:10:25.385 --> 01:10:27.106]  Again, this isn't about me, it's about all of us.
[01:10:27.126 --> 01:10:34.088]  I don't want to sit here and talk about myself, but this is Texas Monthly, and it says the free speech elephant in the Alex Jones courtroom.
[01:10:34.988 --> 01:10:37.528]  And it says everyone's asking, why doesn't he have free speech?
[01:10:37.929 --> 01:10:40.529]  Everyone's asking why he couldn't question something.
[01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:48.451]  Everybody's asking, well, Jones didn't show up for court during the lawsuit, and so he's defaulted, it says.
[01:10:48.792 --> 01:10:50.112]  But none of that's true either.
[01:10:51.308 --> 01:11:03.457]  They sit there in the court with all our emails, all our records, everything, more than anybody ever gave over in a defamation case, and they still default to this because they have to say I'm guilty and then tell a jury they decide how guilty.
[01:11:03.877 --> 01:11:07.319]  And then not let us talk, and not let us challenge anything.
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.401]  And keep all our exhibits out.
[01:11:10.529 --> 01:11:21.476]  She won't let exhibits in about how less than one-tenth of one percent of our coverage was Sandy Hook, and analytics we have showing we made no money off of it, obviously.
[01:11:21.956 --> 01:11:28.240]  We barely ever talked about it, and they went and dredged it up to demonize questioning anything.
[01:11:30.362 --> 01:11:38.167]  Just like they're demonizing you if you question a recession, or open borders, or if you say there's inflation, they tell you there isn't inflation.
[01:11:41.598 --> 01:11:44.641]  That's their answer to everything they're doing is a lie to us.
[01:11:44.681 --> 01:11:45.342]  Here's an example.
[01:11:47.344 --> 01:11:53.751]  Mother loses custody of daughter for refusing transgender status and saying she's a girl.
[01:11:55.392 --> 01:12:03.638]   A court decided a mother's custody of her daughter 2019 when she refused to validate her 12-year-old's claim that she was transgender.
[01:12:03.658 --> 01:12:09.223]  The daughter, Sophie, never returned after visiting her father after she claimed she felt unsafe being with her mother.
[01:12:09.744 --> 01:12:17.311]  Jeanette, a liberal feminist, is fighting to regain custody of her daughter without submitting the court's demand that she declare Sophie is now her son.
[01:12:17.331 --> 01:12:19.753]  They're gonna cut her breast off next.
[01:12:20.954 --> 01:12:21.474]  Mutilation.
[01:12:22.095 --> 01:12:27.351]   If you tried to go in to the doctor and say, I want My finger cut off, they put you in a mental institution.
[01:12:27.551 --> 01:12:32.293]  But if you want your breast, or your penis, or your testicles cut out, they're all for it.
[01:12:35.694 --> 01:12:37.735]  Well, you raise your daughter liberal and see what happens.
[01:12:40.816 --> 01:12:41.797]  She lives in Chicago.
[01:12:41.817 --> 01:12:43.817]  Poor lady, I'm so sorry for her.
[01:12:43.817 --> 01:12:50.817]  Just...
[01:12:50.817 --> 01:12:52.817]  Just unspeakable.
[01:12:52.817 --> 01:12:59.171]   *sniff* Sweden is moving to emancipate children so they can be sterilized under the new gender law.
[01:12:59.671 --> 01:13:12.702]  That's what this is, making being sterilized a new right, a new fashionable thing, and the schools you put your children in confuse them and convince them that they have a right to do this, and their real goal is sterilizing children at age three.
[01:13:13.483 --> 01:13:16.585]  They've been sterilizing children in some parts of the world at age seven.
[01:13:19.648 --> 01:13:20.789]  That's where we are in the year.
[01:13:24.259 --> 01:13:26.660]  2022.
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:26.660]  But there's good news.
[01:13:28.341 --> 01:13:33.423]  Trump, more and more, is getting hardcore against the New World Order to the next level.
[01:13:34.224 --> 01:13:34.664]  Video!
[01:13:34.704 --> 01:13:35.824]  Trump blasts sickos.
[01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:37.225]  In fact, I forgot to tell you to get this clip.
[01:13:37.245 --> 01:13:37.805]  Get the clip, please.
[01:13:38.666 --> 01:13:39.946]  Trump—oh, you have the clip.
[01:13:40.487 --> 01:13:44.588]  Trump blasts sickos pushing sexual content in kindergarten.
[01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:52.712]  A society that refuses to protect its children is a society that soon will not be able to protect anybody.
[01:13:54.684 --> 01:13:55.705]  We'll play that clip in a moment.
[01:13:56.385 --> 01:14:00.669]  And then now Trump comes out and says nobody's gotten to the bottom of 9-11.
[01:14:01.610 --> 01:14:02.451]  What a true statement.
[01:14:02.911 --> 01:14:08.035]  And two days after he was on multiple TV channels, he played the clips many times, saying there were bombs in the buildings.
[01:14:08.075 --> 01:14:09.176]  That's why I like Trump.
[01:14:09.797 --> 01:14:29.631]   So how can he see all that, but not see that even Birx, his top advisor, or number two advisor after Fauci, But top White House advisor says, oh, we knew it wouldn't work, but we told him he would.
[01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:34.754]  She just gave him the out like Bolsonaro has to say, I didn't know they lied to me.
[01:14:35.594 --> 01:14:40.697]  But again, by him going along with this, he signs himself up with it.
[01:14:41.297 --> 01:14:42.798]  He connects himself to it.
[01:14:44.039 --> 01:14:45.360]  And it's just bad, bad, bad.
[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:51.043]  But the good news is, when he's at rallies, he says, I can't say the V word, but I still think it's good.
[01:14:51.103 --> 01:14:52.223]  And I'm proud of it.
[01:14:52.263 --> 01:14:52.964]  And people boo him.
[01:14:54.218 --> 01:15:04.046]  In the face, which almost makes him endearing, because in the face of his own constituents not liking what he's doing, he's pigheaded and still thinks he's the right thing.
[01:15:04.947 --> 01:15:11.292]  So it's an attribute, but it's also a big, big, giant negative to be dealing with this.
[01:15:12.613 --> 01:15:13.533]  We've got the Trump clip.
[01:15:13.553 --> 01:15:15.175]  We'll play it when we come back, and then I'm going to hit.
[01:15:16.398 --> 01:15:19.277]   There's a whole bunch of news breaking and I got to be honest with you.
[01:15:19.277 --> 01:15:24.877]   I'm just, I don't want to say I'm depressed because I know where this is all going, but
[01:15:24.877 --> 01:15:31.757]   I am dizzy that this is so dangerous and that we're so deep now into this and I know where
[01:15:31.757 --> 01:15:39.677]   it goes next and I am just here bracing for the near future crises, war, serious economic
[01:15:39.677 --> 01:15:48.077]   collapse, more power outages, food rationing, and oh, the answer is QR codes and rationing
[01:15:48.077 --> 01:15:53.837]   systems which have already been brought in in Australia, Europe, and so many other areas
[01:15:53.837 --> 01:15:54.837]  like Sri Lanka.
[01:15:55.630 --> 01:15:58.432]  So it's all coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[01:15:58.532 --> 01:16:00.313]  Infowars.com tomorrow's news today.
[01:16:00.713 --> 01:16:02.735]  We're going to come out of break and play the Trump clip.
[01:16:04.008 --> 01:16:06.029]  Is a society that soon will not be able to protect anybody.
[01:16:06.069 --> 01:16:09.992]  This is a hallmark of cultural and social decay against which we should fight back very hard and very soon.
[01:16:09.952 --> 01:16:11.952]  Don't forget band.video.
[01:16:11.952 --> 01:16:19.152]  Is a society that soon will not be able to protect anybody.
[01:16:19.152 --> 01:16:26.112]   This is a hallmark of cultural and social decay against which we should fight back very
[01:16:26.112 --> 01:16:27.671]  hard and very soon.
[01:16:27.671 --> 01:16:31.072]  We don't have time to wait years to do this.
[01:16:31.072 --> 01:16:38.791]   The sickos who are pushing sexual content in kindergartens or providing puberty blockers
[01:16:38.791 --> 01:16:42.152]   to young children who have no idea what a puberty blocker is.
[01:16:42.728 --> 01:16:43.929]  Neither do I, by the way.
[01:16:45.791 --> 01:16:48.534]  Neither do most of the people in the audience as you smile.
[01:16:49.875 --> 01:16:50.957]  Let's just say they're not good.
[01:16:52.789 --> 01:16:59.128]   are not just engaged in acts of depravity, in many cases they are breaking the law
[01:16:59.128 --> 01:17:02.128]  and they should be held fully accountable.
[01:17:02.128 --> 01:17:05.289]  (audience applauding)
[01:17:05.289 --> 01:17:15.269]   And by the way, we should not allow men to play in women's sports.
[01:17:15.269 --> 01:17:18.449]  (audience applauding)
[01:17:18.449 --> 01:17:22.109]  (audience member coughing)
[01:17:22.109 --> 01:17:32.109]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:17:26.852 --> 01:17:29.574]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to go back down to court here.
[01:17:31.996 --> 01:17:40.141]  This kangaroo court where they've already found me guilty, where they won't let us cross-examine people, where they're raping and robbing everybody's freedoms in America.
[01:17:40.161 --> 01:17:41.963]  And, you know, I'm not a victim.
[01:17:42.523 --> 01:17:44.284]  I know the enemies are coming after us all.
[01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:45.665]  You are their victim.
[01:17:45.705 --> 01:17:46.966]  They want to victimize us all.
[01:17:47.687 --> 01:17:48.987]  I chose to get in the arena.
[01:17:49.428 --> 01:17:50.669]  I chose to fight these people.
[01:17:51.769 --> 01:17:55.152]  And they want Infowars destroyed more than anything.
[01:17:56.487 --> 01:18:03.365]   And they know that our operating system of resisting the globalists, what I call 1776 worldwide,
[01:18:03.365 --> 01:18:06.726]   is the truth and is the most effective system to counter them.
[01:18:06.726 --> 01:18:18.087]   That's why they fear us so much. So I take a lot of satisfaction in that, despite all the pain.
[01:18:18.289 --> 01:18:21.930]  And I thank you all for what you've done over the years to keep us on air.
[01:18:21.970 --> 01:18:25.612]  But now, we're all together entering the crucible.
[01:18:26.152 --> 01:18:28.213]  That's not a rhetorical phrase.
[01:18:28.493 --> 01:18:29.453]  We're in this together.
[01:18:29.714 --> 01:18:44.643]   We are literally having them destroy our borders, attack our children, devalue our currency, launch all these wars, promote pedophilia, annihilate our free speech, spy on all of us, We have tyranny.
[01:18:46.504 --> 01:18:47.464]  We have tyrants.
[01:18:50.185 --> 01:18:53.826]  And we've been vindicated in spades, unfortunately.
[01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:55.627]  I would rather have backed this off.
[01:18:55.647 --> 01:18:57.747]  People say, oh, look, he said all this would happen.
[01:18:57.767 --> 01:18:58.328]  It didn't happen.
[01:19:00.108 --> 01:19:01.068]  Instead, it's all happening.
[01:19:01.929 --> 01:19:06.230]  The most important work that we've ever done is happening now.
[01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:09.031]  I want to explain something to you.
[01:19:09.691 --> 01:19:12.452]  We only make a few dollars off each book that's sold at Amazon.
[01:19:13.787 --> 01:19:17.270]  We sell them at InfowarsTour.com, The Great Reset, The War for the World.
[01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:25.197]  And if we could sell, man, if we could sell 100,000 books at Infowars.com, that would really help us pay the bills.
[01:19:25.277 --> 01:19:27.459]  It's a great historic book to have and to share with others.
[01:19:27.699 --> 01:19:29.260]  It exposes the whole New World Order plan.
[01:19:29.601 --> 01:19:30.541]  I'm really proud of this book.
[01:19:30.702 --> 01:19:32.083]  We worked really, really hard on this.
[01:19:32.984 --> 01:19:36.286]  And it blows away all the other best-selling Great Reset books out there.
[01:19:36.647 --> 01:19:42.305]   Steve Bannon said, He said the most important work since the Founding Fathers.
[01:19:42.906 --> 01:19:49.009]  When you really read it, it gives the whole enemy battle plan, and every claim I make, I show you a quote where they said it.
[01:19:49.769 --> 01:19:53.731]  This is a textbook, a blueprint of the enemy's operation.
[01:19:54.051 --> 01:19:55.652]  You want to beat them, you got to have it.
[01:19:56.573 --> 01:19:57.933]  Sure, you'd already know about all this.
[01:19:58.274 --> 01:19:58.574]  Okay.
[01:19:59.894 --> 01:20:00.875]  Buy a couple copies.
[01:20:00.935 --> 01:20:01.735]  Buy five copies.
[01:20:01.855 --> 01:20:03.836]  And people of means, buy 50 copies.
[01:20:04.817 --> 01:20:05.597]  Go to Amazon.
[01:20:05.637 --> 01:20:07.718]  Buy 10 copies, 20 copies right now.
[01:20:08.219 --> 01:20:08.539]  Get them.
[01:20:09.451 --> 01:20:16.357]  Give them to the library, give them to the police department, give them to your pastor, give them to your doctor, give them to your lawyer, give them to your wife, your husband, your co-workers.
[01:20:16.797 --> 01:20:18.378]  Now is the time to be all in.
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:22.662]  It's number one in history and now 17 other charts.
[01:20:23.182 --> 01:20:32.170]  It's number 50 as of this morning in the world on the number one most important chart ahead of Obama's book and Michael Obama's book.
[01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:35.753]  Or also known as Michelle Obama, but he calls her Michael.
[01:20:37.474 --> 01:20:38.235]  In five speeches.
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:50.142]  So, we're ahead of Obama, and we're ahead of his husband, Michael.
[01:20:51.342 --> 01:20:59.444]  So, this is a big deal, ladies and gentlemen, and we need to get this book to number one in the world.
[01:21:01.325 --> 01:21:02.845]  Number one in the world.
[01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:08.326]  So, as much as I want you to buy it at InfoWarsTore.com, go buy a signed copy at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:21:10.782 --> 01:21:15.685]  But get multiple copies from Amazon and get them out to everyone you know.
[01:21:15.725 --> 01:21:20.748]  That's the place to get it because it'll drive it to number one and use the enemy's own systems against them.
[01:21:23.229 --> 01:21:26.071]  Continuing, Alex's War is now live and available.
[01:21:26.650 --> 01:21:31.770]   It was number two on the charts the last few weeks on Apple pre-orders.
[01:21:31.770 --> 01:21:38.690]   And now it is available at alexiswar.com to watch the trailer, to watch the film on Apple
[01:21:38.690 --> 01:21:39.690]  TV and iTunes.
[01:21:39.690 --> 01:21:40.690]  A very powerful film.
[01:21:40.690 --> 01:21:43.010]  Chronically our 28 years of the fight against globalists.
[01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:44.529]  Get it on Vimeo.
[01:21:44.529 --> 01:21:46.810]  You can watch it on Odyssey.
[01:21:46.810 --> 01:21:49.489]  Get it on Rockfin.
[01:21:49.489 --> 01:21:50.489]  Watch it on Locals.
[01:21:50.489 --> 01:21:52.529]  Get it on Amazon Prime.
[01:21:52.529 --> 01:21:54.050]  Get it on Google Play.
[01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:56.570]  Get it on Microsoft, Xbox.
[01:21:56.570 --> 01:21:58.650]  Try it on YouTube.
[01:21:58.650 --> 01:22:02.970]  Get it on so many other platforms, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:03.231 --> 01:22:04.732]  And these folks have put a lot of money into this.
[01:22:04.752 --> 01:22:13.140]  They're putting billboards up like the one you see on screen in Los Angeles and other cities around the country.
[01:22:14.161 --> 01:22:14.862]  We're fighting back.
[01:22:14.902 --> 01:22:23.848]   I told you that we had more than 10 projects going and we've launched Several of them now working with folks.
[01:22:24.429 --> 01:22:26.431]  We've got at least eight projects.
[01:22:27.953 --> 01:22:28.934]  I get a little extreme.
[01:22:28.974 --> 01:22:31.196]  I try to do too much, but they're all months behind.
[01:22:31.236 --> 01:22:34.500]  But several of them are going to be breaking in the next month.
[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:36.802]  Then a bunch of others are going to be coming after that.
[01:22:37.823 --> 01:22:44.446]  Uh, and I'm the type of guy that goes to a buffet, especially when I ran six miles every couple days and lives away for two hours a day.
[01:22:44.466 --> 01:22:49.408]  I would go to like a Furze, all-you-can-eat cafeteria and eat like three plate loads of food.
[01:22:49.428 --> 01:22:50.028]  I don't do that now.
[01:22:50.048 --> 01:22:51.649]  I eat one plate load of food and I'm still fat.
[01:22:52.570 --> 01:22:55.231]  But that's kind of how I am with resisting the globalists.
[01:22:55.931 --> 01:22:59.133]  Back when I had plenty of money and extra money, I didn't even try to raise extra money.
[01:22:59.493 --> 01:23:00.754]  We had plenty coming in years ago.
[01:23:01.515 --> 01:23:09.160]  I supported and financed so many films and groups and made just pure donations to invest in films exposing pedophilia and all the rest of it.
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:13.863]  But now we're crushed down in the resistance to our Masada Hilltop here.
[01:23:15.071 --> 01:23:15.812]  Or Alamo.
[01:23:16.552 --> 01:23:18.654]  And we need your support now more than ever.
[01:23:18.674 --> 01:23:20.075]  So I want to encourage you.
[01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:22.797]  I don't make money off Alex's war in the theaters.
[01:23:22.897 --> 01:23:24.138]  I don't care about the truth getting out.
[01:23:24.438 --> 01:23:26.599]  But you can buy the DVD so they can't censor it.
[01:23:26.859 --> 01:23:29.822]  So it's in your archive to share with others at Infowarshore.com.
[01:23:31.062 --> 01:23:32.644]  Screenings start this Friday.
[01:23:33.344 --> 01:23:50.966]   So you can buy tickets now in Hollywood, California, Santa Monica, Waterloo, Indiana, at Addison, Illinois, O'Fallon, Illinois, Granville, Cape Girardi, Missouri, Lake Ozark, Missouri, Elk River, Minnesota, Oakdale, Minnesota, Fargo, North Dakota.
[01:23:50.986 --> 01:23:52.446]  This is where Patriots have been asking for it.
[01:23:52.806 --> 01:24:04.931]  Omaha, Nebraska, Las Vegas, Nevada, New York, New York, Columbus, Ohio, Mentor, Ohio, Cordova, Tennessee, Franklin, Tennessee, Austin, Texas, Janesville, Wisconsin, and many others.
[01:24:05.191 --> 01:24:06.392]  This list is two days old.
[01:24:06.452 --> 01:24:08.592]  I'm told it's been added to more than a hundred other cities.
[01:24:08.953 --> 01:24:14.389]   So we're at a hundred and 20 cities or so, it's showing at one theater in North Austin.
[01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:19.950]  We need those to sell out, and then it'll get put in theaters all over the country.
[01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:21.971]  A major, major victory.
[01:24:22.011 --> 01:24:26.792]  This is a war of money, a war of energy, a war of culture, a war of action.
[01:24:26.812 --> 01:24:29.592]  We're already number one in the history section.
[01:24:32.153 --> 01:24:33.453]  World history, we're number one.
[01:24:33.973 --> 01:24:34.254]  U.S.
[01:24:34.294 --> 01:24:35.334]  history, we're number one.
[01:24:35.354 --> 01:24:40.075]  I think it's 17 or 18 sections we're number one in right now.
[01:24:41.587 --> 01:24:48.009]  Ahead of Klaus Schwab, Yuval Harari, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, all of them.
[01:24:49.129 --> 01:24:50.950]  So do that and take action.
[01:24:52.450 --> 01:24:57.292]  Separately, vitamin-mineral fusion has been our overall bestseller when it came out five years ago.
[01:24:57.652 --> 01:25:07.235]  Most people love it, it tastes so good, it makes them feel great, boosts your immune system, all the essential vitamins and minerals of a high-quality, organic type you can absorb, a natural type.

[01:25:16.159 --> 01:25:17.440]  Have a glass up in the morning or the evening.
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:18.400]  It tastes amazing.
[01:25:18.761 --> 01:25:21.162]  It's available at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:25:21.522 --> 01:25:24.063]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out for a long time.
[01:25:24.123 --> 01:25:27.145]  It's discounted back at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:25:27.525 --> 01:25:28.906]  And we have the new Diet Force.
[01:25:28.966 --> 01:25:33.928]  And let me tell you, I go up and down in weight because, you know, if I work out every day and eat good, I lose a lot of weight.
[01:25:33.948 --> 01:25:34.969]  If I don't, I gain a lot of weight.
[01:25:35.845 --> 01:25:38.468]  That's a evolutionary adaptation, that's what they would call it.
[01:25:38.488 --> 01:25:46.256]  But the point is, is that I lost, I haven't weighed in two weeks, and with this trial I haven't been working out the last week, so this is what happened.
[01:25:46.276 --> 01:25:49.940]  But with diet and exercise, we added diet force to it, I lost 39 pounds.
[01:25:51.334 --> 01:25:53.175]  And so people can see it too in my face.
[01:25:54.015 --> 01:25:55.316]  I'm still a really stocky guy.
[01:25:55.897 --> 01:25:59.078]  I got a 20-inch neck and 42-inch chest, the whole nine yards.
[01:25:59.118 --> 01:26:01.900]  But I have definitely lost a lot of weight with DietForce.
[01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:07.863]  Known concentrated compounds that help you naturally accelerate your metabolism and more.
[01:26:07.943 --> 01:26:10.725]  DietForce is 40% off, but it's about to sell out.
[01:26:11.165 --> 01:26:13.046]  So it's going to go to regular price until it sells out.
[01:26:13.406 --> 01:26:14.587]  So it's still at 40% off.
[01:26:14.927 --> 01:26:15.867]  Infowarrestore.com.
[01:26:16.188 --> 01:26:16.488]  All right.
[01:26:17.208 --> 01:26:18.911]  Robert Barnes is coming in.
[01:26:19.572 --> 01:26:24.060]  He's going to cover the waterfront and then I'm going to do a special Saturday show tomorrow.
[01:26:24.401 --> 01:26:26.023]  They're not going to be censored by these monsters.
[01:26:26.104 --> 01:26:41.583]  Stay with us.
[01:26:42.017 --> 01:26:46.821]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is, don't panic.
[01:26:47.262 --> 01:26:54.468]  Stay calm, because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe, sound course.
[01:26:54.808 --> 01:26:58.852]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules.
[01:26:59.472 --> 01:27:01.293]  And building our own society.
[01:27:01.713 --> 01:27:03.935]  All we gotta do is survive the crash.
[01:27:04.335 --> 01:27:06.896]  And right now, we still have time to prepare.
[01:27:07.317 --> 01:27:11.119]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[01:27:11.499 --> 01:27:13.640]  It's time to convert it into hard assets.
[01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:14.340]  Now.
[01:27:14.781 --> 01:27:17.702]  Including food, water, and survival gear.
[01:27:17.902 --> 01:27:19.783]  To keep us strong and at the ready.
[01:27:20.324 --> 01:27:23.866]  Go to preparetoday.com for the essentials.
[01:27:24.466 --> 01:27:31.196]  Storeable foods, water filtration, first aid, power, and more at preparetoday.com.
[01:27:33.492 --> 01:27:36.395]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[01:27:36.435 --> 01:27:44.060]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:47.643]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[01:27:47.683 --> 01:27:49.284]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[01:27:49.465 --> 01:27:51.366]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[01:27:51.626 --> 01:27:53.748]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[01:27:54.008 --> 01:27:55.049]  This is all confirmed.
[01:27:55.089 --> 01:27:56.070]  This is not a drill.
[01:27:56.190 --> 01:28:00.413]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[01:28:00.453 --> 01:28:01.834]  They've officially become state-run.
[01:28:02.174 --> 01:28:02.454]  Apple 100%.
[01:28:02.854 --> 01:28:08.477]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[01:28:08.937 --> 01:28:13.679]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[01:28:14.019 --> 01:28:14.859]  This is happening.
[01:28:14.879 --> 01:28:22.983]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[01:28:23.043 --> 01:28:28.825]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[01:28:29.425 --> 01:28:37.267]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[01:28:37.487 --> 01:28:41.628]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[01:28:41.688 --> 01:28:45.149]  We adapt to being oppressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[01:28:45.369 --> 01:28:52.471]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[01:28:52.691 --> 01:28:55.351]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[01:28:55.190 --> 01:29:06.270]   It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traitors
[01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:11.029]   inside the major security agencies blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting
[01:29:11.029 --> 01:29:15.990]   to stop us from removing the tentacles of the Qaikom/Big Tech hanging combine emergency
[01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.990]  situation.
[01:29:16.990 --> 01:29:20.389]   I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been
[01:29:20.389 --> 01:29:23.190]  battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[01:29:23.231 --> 01:29:31.937]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[01:29:31.957 --> 01:29:36.860]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:42.123]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[01:29:42.563 --> 01:29:50.650]  And then they built me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[01:29:50.670 --> 01:29:57.376]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[01:29:57.496 --> 01:30:03.201]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[01:30:03.401 --> 01:30:07.805]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[01:30:07.845 --> 01:30:10.187]  I have given you the transmission!
[01:30:15.033 --> 01:30:25.588]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:30:25.748 --> 01:30:26.869]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:30:26.949 --> 01:30:31.235]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:30:35.216 --> 01:30:42.878]  Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like, at least in government.
[01:30:43.158 --> 01:30:48.860]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations.
[01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:51.101]  The left have wised up to this.
[01:30:51.301 --> 01:30:56.682]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it.
[01:30:56.702 --> 01:30:57.783]  The social media giants.
[01:30:58.043 --> 01:30:58.443]  And they are.
[01:30:58.803 --> 01:31:04.484]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[01:31:04.524 --> 01:31:09.225]  So far the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[01:31:09.365 --> 01:31:17.047]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[01:31:17.067 --> 01:31:22.948]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[01:31:23.168 --> 01:31:26.009]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[01:31:26.249 --> 01:31:29.871]  But this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[01:31:30.232 --> 01:31:40.078]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech.
[01:31:40.618 --> 01:31:41.919]  People know what's true.
[01:31:42.139 --> 01:31:42.940]  They can smell it.
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:48.344]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:31:48.864 --> 01:31:50.865]  In a free country, everyone can be hurt.
[01:31:50.744 --> 01:31:54.744]  In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be heard.
[01:31:55.744 --> 01:32:23.744]  [Music]
[01:32:23.744 --> 01:32:25.744]  [Applause]
[01:32:25.744 --> 01:32:33.744]  [Music]
[01:32:33.744 --> 01:32:35.744]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:39.803]  This is Robert Barnes guest hosting for this hour.
[01:32:40.403 --> 01:32:57.037]  We're going to be talking about a range of topics, including California's attempts to basically kidnap children from around the country and be able to bring them in for trans treatment, according to a law that they're trying to propose and propound, and the latest inanity and insanity out of California's legislative ranks.
[01:32:57.737 --> 01:32:58.678]  But that's not all.
[01:32:58.958 --> 01:33:22.355]  We'll also talk and discuss the various efforts going around around the globe in terms of Liz Truss, likely to become the next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and what that means, or if it means anything, even as The Guardian, one of the most pro-war publications in the United Kingdom, has a front page editorial about how their efforts have failed and the globalists have lost in their battle against Putin and Russia.
[01:33:22.954 --> 01:33:28.854]   But first, everybody should remember that they are the front line that continues to
[01:33:28.854 --> 01:33:36.213]   hold for InfoWars against this extraordinary and exceptional, unparalleled and unprecedented
[01:33:36.213 --> 01:33:43.493]   legal attack on InfoWars and Alex Jones taking place in the show trial in Travis County,
[01:33:43.493 --> 01:33:44.493]  Texas.
[01:33:44.493 --> 01:33:48.055]   What keeps InfoWars on the air, what allows you to continue to access the information
[01:33:48.055 --> 01:33:54.454]   that you want, is making the choice to become healthier, wealthier and wiser by supporting
[01:33:54.454 --> 01:33:59.454]   InfoWarsStore.com, buying products that you like, products that you want, products that
[01:33:59.454 --> 01:34:02.573]  you need, products that you benefit from.
[01:34:02.573 --> 01:34:09.295]   And in the process of doing so, do so at competitive pricing, often priced substantially less than
[01:34:09.295 --> 01:34:13.654]   competitors for comparable quality, while getting goods and ingredients independent
[01:34:13.654 --> 01:34:19.173]   and separate from the big pharma, big retail company machine, directly wholesale, directly
[01:34:19.173 --> 01:34:21.295]  retailed right to you.
[01:34:21.295 --> 01:34:26.414]   And doing so by supporting a network in the process that keeps independent information
[01:34:26.414 --> 01:34:29.414]  accessible and available to people around the globe.
[01:34:29.477 --> 01:34:32.100]  Who was the tip of the spear in fighting lockdowns?
[01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:33.241]  It was InfoWars.
[01:34:33.642 --> 01:34:39.008]  Who was the tip of the spear in exposing the election fornication that took place in November 2020?
[01:34:39.849 --> 01:34:40.850]  It was InfoWars.
[01:34:41.351 --> 01:34:47.858]  Who was the tip of the spear at promoting the candidacy of presidential candidate, then president, Donald J. Trump?
[01:34:48.018 --> 01:34:49.200]  It was InfoWars.
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:35:04.494]  Who was the tip of the spear exposing the Ukraine conflict against the war whores in both Congress and the mainstream press, and exposing it for what it has in fact become an extraordinary boondoggle and exceptional grift for the Biden families of the world.
[01:35:04.994 --> 01:35:05.935]  It was InfoWars.
[01:35:06.496 --> 01:35:07.597]  And this goes all the way back.
[01:35:08.157 --> 01:35:14.822]  Who was it that was exposing that incubator baby story was a false and fake story to get us involved in the first Iraq war?
[01:35:15.262 --> 01:35:16.603]  It was a young Alex Jones.
[01:35:16.984 --> 01:35:18.485]  All the way back in the early 90s.
[01:35:18.845 --> 01:35:20.306]  Who was exposing Ruby Ridge?
[01:35:20.626 --> 01:35:21.967]  Who was exposing Waco?
[01:35:22.248 --> 01:35:25.290]  Who was exposing what really happened in Oklahoma City?
[01:35:25.650 --> 01:35:27.251]  Who was exposing what happened in 9-11?
[01:35:28.152 --> 01:35:30.855]  Who was exposing the first Iraq, the second Iraq war.
[01:35:31.175 --> 01:35:33.257]  Who was exposing the Afghan war debacle.
[01:35:33.557 --> 01:35:39.963]  Who was consistently supporting Edward Snowden, whistleblowers like Julian Assange who published those whistleblowers.
[01:35:40.423 --> 01:35:42.946]  Again, it was InfoWars, it was InfoWars.
[01:35:43.366 --> 01:36:09.446]  The media only wants you to talk about a tiny, tiny, tiny slice of coverage, as Alex Jones put it in his interview with Glenn Greenwald at the premiere of Alex's War, which by the way is now available in cities across America today, and you can get it available and download it today, or you can purchase the DVD to keep it into posterity, given some of the digital copies can disappear overnight, right at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:36:09.986 --> 01:36:20.491]  That documentary, which again is not even a pro-Alex documentary, it's just, here's who Alex Jones is, here's who's Alex Jones' history, here's both sides of a bunch of the arguments and debate.
[01:36:20.531 --> 01:36:24.292]  It quotes Megyn Kelly throughout the different parts of the documentary.
[01:36:24.592 --> 01:36:30.655]  But it is a fair, impartial view of Alex Jones, not a partial prejudicial view.
[01:36:31.235 --> 01:36:35.358]  Like we are seeing from the joke of a judge in Travis County, Texas.
[01:36:35.398 --> 01:36:44.546]  If you want to see what bad judges look like, if you want to see what judges who lack a judicious temperament look like, then you need to go no further than Travis County, Texas.
[01:36:45.504 --> 01:36:45.965]  Indeed.
[01:36:46.605 --> 01:36:56.035]  If I was down there the other day, and just when I came in the courtroom, the plaintiff's lawyer started hopping around like a bunny rabbit, yipping, Bobby Barnes, Bobby Barnes, Bobby Barnes.
[01:36:56.055 --> 01:36:57.376]  That's how nuts these people are.
[01:36:58.157 --> 01:37:01.440]  They're people that need a straitjacket, not anything else for Christmas.
[01:37:02.021 --> 01:37:03.562]  That's the nature of it.
[01:37:03.583 --> 01:37:08.387]  But what was more striking to me was I was wondering, how is there this case taking place?
[01:37:09.048 --> 01:37:12.591]  That appears to be nothing about what is supposed to be taking place.
[01:37:13.091 --> 01:37:24.500]  Purportedly, this trial in Travis County, Texas is only about damages because, contrary to American legal principles, Alex Jones has been a judge guilty without a trial by jury.
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:26.301]  So the only question is damages.
[01:37:26.541 --> 01:37:29.563]  Yet we've heard almost no evidence that's actually about damages.
[01:37:29.984 --> 01:37:35.828]  We've only heard a one-sided presentation of why one side thinks Alex Jones is guilty when he's already been a judge guilty.
[01:37:36.088 --> 01:37:37.770]  So why is any of that evidence coming in?
[01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:39.230]  Well, here's why.
[01:37:39.390 --> 01:37:45.152]  When I walked in, there were three big movie cameras set up in the courthouse.
[01:37:45.652 --> 01:37:46.892]  Three big movie cameras.
[01:37:47.012 --> 01:37:50.033]  One of them, by the way, staring right down at the jury.
[01:37:50.453 --> 01:37:59.075]  So the jury knows they're part of an ongoing future film because they can't avoid it because the big camera is staring at them the entire case.
[01:37:59.795 --> 01:38:01.437]  The, well, what is this about?
[01:38:01.477 --> 01:38:12.147]  This is about the losing Neverland production company getting the rights to film, exclusive rights by the judge, to film this show trial to create their own show trial.
[01:38:12.588 --> 01:38:16.011]  And that is why they're presenting evidence that has nothing at all to do with damages.
[01:38:16.432 --> 01:38:24.959]   Instead, all the evidence they're presenting is a one-sided presentation to keep up the median myth, the median narrative about Alex Jones!
[01:38:25.019 --> 01:38:27.540]  That Alex Jones only ever talked about Sandy Hook.
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:30.862]  That Alex Jones is the reason why anybody had doubts about Sandy Hook.
[01:38:31.102 --> 01:38:31.582]  All false!
[01:38:31.662 --> 01:38:32.342]  They know it's false.
[01:38:32.702 --> 01:38:41.506]  There were tens of millions of views of other YouTube shows and other various social media posts that challenged what happened at Sandy Hook long before Alex Jones said anything.
[01:38:42.046 --> 01:38:44.248]  Uh, about that particular subject matter.
[01:38:44.448 --> 01:38:46.230]  Or interviewed any of those particular witnesses.
[01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:47.331]  They were all over the place.
[01:38:47.351 --> 01:38:53.116]  There were media experts, law experts, philosophy experts, a bunch of people raising a whole bunch of different questions.
[01:38:53.416 --> 01:38:55.038]  They were all over the place.
[01:38:55.158 --> 01:38:56.719]  Anybody who remembers it, remembers it.
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:03.886]  I was one of the people trying to explain why it was not accurate, some of these theories, at the time, but that clearly the politicians were hiding something.
[01:39:04.466 --> 01:39:07.229]  So why is any of this evidence coming in in such a one-sided way?
[01:39:07.289 --> 01:39:10.331]  Well, it's coming in because this is for a movie!
[01:39:10.431 --> 01:39:13.114]  This is literally a show trial within a show trial!
[01:39:13.414 --> 01:39:15.236]  A show trial for a show trial!
[01:39:15.576 --> 01:39:28.448]  The goal is to basically create a show that's gonna actually be a televised show, and here's the benefit to the production crew, to the future HBO folks, whoever else is making it.
[01:39:29.048 --> 01:39:48.655]  Is that now they can do this one-sided presentation, lead people to falsely believe it was actually an impartial trial on all of the evidence, when it was only a one-sided presentation of one side of the evidence, and because they are filming it in court, they can't be sued for lying.
[01:39:49.375 --> 01:39:59.198]  Because when you produce, when you republish or rebroadcast something that happens in court, then it's not subject to, it is immune from defamation and libel claims.
[01:39:59.559 --> 01:40:11.383]  However, if the judge allowed Alex Jones' side to actually be heard, meaningfully, to present all of the evidence, to present all of the videos, according to the plaintiff's counsels, any editing of videos is altered.
[01:40:11.623 --> 01:40:16.804]  Well, that means all of their evidence in the entire trial is altered evidence by their own definition.
[01:40:17.204 --> 01:40:20.944]   But why do they want that altered evidence for an altered story?
[01:40:20.944 --> 01:40:25.604]   Because the judge wants to be able to afford this production crew to systematically build
[01:40:25.604 --> 01:40:31.765]   a fake narrative, a permanent show documentary of a show trial, a show about a show trial,
[01:40:31.765 --> 01:40:35.264]   in order to get people to believe something that's totally false.
[01:40:35.264 --> 01:40:39.403]   Because if Alex Jones was allowed to present his side of the story, then they would have
[01:40:39.403 --> 01:40:44.805]   to include those aspects in the documentary because it wouldn't be fair reporting of the
[01:40:44.805 --> 01:40:45.684]  court proceeding.
[01:40:46.126 --> 01:40:52.511]  You can't just report one side of a court proceeding and thereby claim immunity if you repeated a false statement.
[01:40:52.891 --> 01:40:58.475]  You can only do that if you impartially and neutrally and fairly reported what happened in court.
[01:40:58.975 --> 01:41:08.803]  So that's why the judge is rigging the court proceeding to make sure that the script, and this is literally a script, a script gets told in a certain way for future audiences.
[01:41:09.144 --> 01:41:15.409]  The goal will be for, particularly people who've never known, never heard about Alex Jones, to say, you can't go to Alex Jones.
[01:41:15.629 --> 01:41:16.250]  He's dangerous.
[01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:17.290]  You can't go to InfoWars.
[01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:17.931]  That's dangerous.
[01:41:18.311 --> 01:41:27.339]  Those are the people that did this horrible thing as found by an impartial independent jury after a full admission of the case where Alex Jones was there to present a defense.
[01:41:27.839 --> 01:41:30.781]  That's the goal of even having any kind of trial at all.
[01:41:31.242 --> 01:41:38.248]  It's to be able to create the perception, the false perception, that there was actually a meaningful trial that occurred here, when there wasn't.
[01:41:38.608 --> 01:41:40.649]  This trial is a joke of a trial.
[01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:50.357]  It does not conform to any constitutional standard, or any rule of law standard, or any even rule of evidence standard about how these cases are supposed to progress and proceed.
[01:41:51.258 --> 01:41:54.961]  And that is why you're witnessing what you are witnessing in Travis County.
[01:41:55.301 --> 01:42:02.367]  That's the same reason, most likely, that the judge is often taking down the videos right after the trial happens.
[01:42:02.567 --> 01:42:04.689]  She doesn't want the world to see the real trial.
[01:42:04.749 --> 01:42:06.671]  She doesn't want the world to see the real evidence.
[01:42:07.011 --> 01:42:10.294]  That's why this is truly a show trial within a show trial.
[01:42:10.814 --> 01:42:18.359]  When we come back we're going to discuss the various latest globalist plans that are either backfiring or maybe backfiring on the rest of us.
[01:42:18.859 --> 01:42:22.001]  That and more after the break here at InfoWars.
[01:42:22.982 --> 01:42:24.703]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:42:24.763 --> 01:42:26.564]  This is Robert Barnes guest hosting.
[01:42:27.245 --> 01:42:29.246]  Have you heard about SB 107?
[01:42:30.367 --> 01:42:33.249]  A recommended piece of legislation from California?
[01:42:33.989 --> 01:42:39.113]  Well let me give you what their description is according to publications favorable to it.
[01:42:40.109 --> 01:42:46.362]  It's California's trans refuge bill, that's what they're calling it, could create a safe haven for trans youth.
[01:42:48.045 --> 01:42:50.029]  The California is trying to propose a bill.
[01:42:50.993 --> 01:43:05.539]  That the way in which it provides this protection is it would prohibit California from complying with any out-of-state subpoenas concerning medical information or other information about trans youth.
[01:43:05.659 --> 01:43:11.962]  In other words, youth that are undergoing medical experimentation as children to transition into a different gender.
[01:43:12.903 --> 01:43:19.025]  It would also reject out-of-court state judgments that threaten to remove children from their homes.
[01:43:19.325 --> 01:43:20.106]  Now what does that mean?
[01:43:20.885 --> 01:43:29.551]  What all of this really entails is there's a full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitution that requires each state to recognize another state's judgment.
[01:43:29.932 --> 01:43:34.915]  It cannot unilaterally override that state's judgment based on internal legislation.
[01:43:35.516 --> 01:43:42.601]  There's also other provisions, in particular in the family context, that also require respect and recognition of another state's judgment.
[01:43:43.202 --> 01:43:47.185]  This is, in fact, the article goes on to detail, this is focused on Texas particularly.
[01:43:47.805 --> 01:43:59.019]  Texas has made clear, as the Attorney General and others, and the Governor, that attempts to force medical transitioning onto young children is child abuse.
[01:43:59.479 --> 01:44:09.307]   The reason why they have concluded that is based on a wide range of medical evidence That basically challenges and questions whether or not this could be ever a good idea for people.
[01:44:09.707 --> 01:44:14.729]  There are many people already complaining that went through the treatment, saying this treatment was a bad idea.
[01:44:14.929 --> 01:44:16.229]  I wish I never would have gone through it.
[01:44:16.609 --> 01:44:17.870]  I was too young when I took it.
[01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:19.870]  I wasn't in a state of informed consent.
[01:44:20.430 --> 01:44:22.531]  My parents were misguided and misdirected.
[01:44:22.871 --> 01:44:24.912]  My doctor gave me poor information.
[01:44:25.632 --> 01:44:44.433]  And so because of it, they're trying to prohibit it in the state of Texas, or at least punish it and prescribe it as a form of child abuse to force a young child to undergo medical transition, surgeries, or other chemical treatment that could have permanent altering effects on their well-being.
[01:44:45.074 --> 01:44:53.260]  So California's response to this is to try to pass a special law that basically says we're not going to recognize Texas law.
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:45:13.512]   Not only that, if you have a judgment against you as a parent for child abuse, or if you have a judgment against you in terms of custody, or if there's evidence that is in California concerning your abuse, Then now you can escape to California, and California is a welcome kitty abusers state for the whole country.
[01:45:13.532 --> 01:45:26.238]  They're not only a sanctuary for illegal immigration, not only a sanctuary for abortions that would be illegal in a particular state, they're now going to be sanctuaries for child abusers and those who would harm children.
[01:45:26.918 --> 01:45:50.063]  And allow those children to mostly they're not going to be going by themselves unless California plans on just effectively legally kidnapping kids from across the country so that they come without their parents to California and are able to undergo this experimental treatment that has caused so much harm to so many people as has been reported in the literature and by those individuals themselves.
[01:45:51.123 --> 01:46:10.671]  Presumably it is also an encouragement for parents who lose custody battles in Texas or lose or in other states or lose other battles in Texas concerning their efforts to force trans treatment on their children to be able to escape to California without any consequences for that.
[01:46:10.751 --> 01:46:12.851]  Without any legal consequences for that.
[01:46:13.352 --> 01:46:19.274]  This is a flagrant violation of the full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitution.
[01:46:19.954 --> 01:46:25.797]  It is a complete violation of federal law specifically written as part of treaties.
[01:46:26.237 --> 01:46:38.183]  The Uniform Interstate Family Support Act and other legislation like it that I've litigated in the past on behalf of Wesley Snipes and others when it's been misused and abused by jurisdictions previously.
[01:46:38.743 --> 01:46:40.885]  That this is an attempt to violate that as well.
[01:46:40.985 --> 01:47:01.481]   So it's a flagrant ignoring of federal law, flagrant violation of constitutional principle, and a flagrant attempt to interfere with the parent-child relationship and the interfere and create and incentivize children getting these experimental Treatments that again many have complained about later.
[01:47:01.861 --> 01:47:04.503]  That's the state of mind in California.
[01:47:04.543 --> 01:47:10.887]  That is why anybody who stays in California, if you're there, you should only be there because you have no other choice.
[01:47:11.087 --> 01:47:13.809]  This is the direction California is going in.
[01:47:14.449 --> 01:47:19.274]  As City Journal reported today, its educational experiment has been a complete debacle.
[01:47:19.754 --> 01:47:22.317]  Its economic experiment has been a complete debacle.
[01:47:22.697 --> 01:47:26.621]  Here you have a state with some of the most natural beauty in the entire world.
[01:47:27.182 --> 01:47:33.608]  A state that has Hollywood and the movie industry and much of the music industry located within it.
[01:47:34.048 --> 01:47:38.913]  And yet the most common thing you will find in California these days is a U-Haul truck.
[01:47:39.253 --> 01:47:40.374]  For people moving out.
[01:47:40.674 --> 01:47:41.695]  For people getting out.
[01:47:41.895 --> 01:47:52.825]  Indeed, it began to net lose population for the first time in its entire history in the past few years due to the effects of its policies and politics.
[01:47:53.185 --> 01:47:56.047]  And this is despite being a sanctuary state for illegal immigration.
[01:47:56.388 --> 01:48:00.951]  So this means its citizens are really fleeing and trying to get out of California.
[01:48:01.272 --> 01:48:02.853]  Or commie-fornia as I like to call it.
[01:48:03.193 --> 01:48:06.136]  And this latest bit of legislation is a revelation on it.
[01:48:06.616 --> 01:48:12.278]  Similarly, Massachusetts is passing abortion laws that are an attempt to interfere with other states' laws.
[01:48:12.738 --> 01:48:20.001]  Because it's one thing to say, if you come to Massachusetts, we recognize abortion at whatever rate we choose to do so.
[01:48:20.561 --> 01:48:23.382]  That's Massachusetts business, according to the U.S.
[01:48:23.402 --> 01:48:24.483]  Supreme Court's decision.
[01:48:25.123 --> 01:48:40.656]  What it is not Massachusetts business is to try to interfere with Alabama or interfere with Pennsylvania or interfere with Ohio and induce people to violate laws in Ohio by coming to Massachusetts to do certain procedures.
[01:48:41.157 --> 01:48:48.143]  At that point it becomes a conspiracy to commit a crime in the state of Ohio which the state itself is becoming complicit in.
[01:48:48.683 --> 01:48:50.865]  But that is the direction things are going in.
[01:48:50.925 --> 01:48:51.365]  And why?
[01:48:51.425 --> 01:48:59.551]  What is the common theme between this Massachusetts case, the California case, and even what's happening in Austin and Alex Jones' case?
[01:48:59.591 --> 01:49:01.392]  Or what happened to Steve Bannon?
[01:49:01.433 --> 01:49:03.514]  Or what's happening in the January 6th trials?
[01:49:03.554 --> 01:49:12.301]  Or what's happening in the Justice Department trying to weaponize its power against Donald John Trump to prevent him from running for office in 2024 with a bogus indictment?
[01:49:12.401 --> 01:49:15.203]  Or the Fulton County, Georgia's office trying to do the same?
[01:49:15.563 --> 01:49:19.925]  What they all have in common is that the left views the law differently than everybody else.
[01:49:20.386 --> 01:49:23.287]  The left views the law as simply a tool.
[01:49:23.507 --> 01:49:24.908]  As simply a means.
[01:49:25.388 --> 01:49:27.189]  All they care about is the outcome.
[01:49:27.629 --> 01:49:29.650]  They don't care if you have due process of law.
[01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:32.132]  They don't care if constitutional rights are respected.
[01:49:32.392 --> 01:49:36.714]  They don't care if the process is done by trial by jury, trial by judge, or trial by nobody.
[01:49:37.074 --> 01:49:38.736]  They only care about the outcome.
[01:49:39.096 --> 01:49:41.838]  Does the outcome conform to their policy objective?
[01:49:42.139 --> 01:49:47.623]  And they're willing and ready and eager to weaponize everything to get there.
[01:49:48.024 --> 01:49:50.826]  They're willing to ignore compacts between the states.
[01:49:51.127 --> 01:49:52.628]  They're willing to ignore U.S.
[01:49:52.668 --> 01:49:53.909]  constitutional restrictions.
[01:49:54.189 --> 01:49:55.951]  They're willing to ignore federal law.
[01:49:56.211 --> 01:49:58.353]  They're willing to ignore, in some cases, their own state law.
[01:49:58.193 --> 01:50:02.912]   laws applicable to a set of circumstances. They're willing to ignore in some cases their own governor,
[01:50:02.912 --> 01:50:06.993]   as has happened repeatedly in Texas, with the Republic of Austin trying to pretend it's
[01:50:06.993 --> 01:50:09.782]  independent quite frequently throughout the pandemic.
[01:50:09.782 --> 01:50:14.583]   Indeed, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals had to reaffirm once again that the state of Texas
[01:50:14.583 --> 01:50:20.092]   has the right to not allow school mask mandates to go into place because lower courts in Texas and
[01:50:20.092 --> 01:50:25.103]   other officials in Texas were ignoring that order. It's all part of a pattern, and it's one we
[01:50:25.103 --> 01:50:30.672]   have to come to terms with and recognize in dealing with the modern-day legal left, which is they do
[01:50:30.672 --> 01:50:32.672]  not believe in the rule of law.
[01:50:32.842 --> 01:50:34.363]  They only believe in the rule of results.
[01:50:34.923 --> 01:50:41.344]  They only believe that he who has the power rules, not that he who rules should rule conscientiously or constitutionally.
[01:50:41.744 --> 01:50:49.646]  And until we accept that and understand that, we won't be able to meaningfully predict what they do or resist what they do, as all of you continue to do.
[01:50:50.186 --> 01:51:02.955]  When we come back into the Court of Public Opinion and other matters, we will be discussing whether or not Trump's indictment could in fact prevent his candidacy in 2024, or whether it will just be a little bump on the road.
[01:51:03.455 --> 01:51:06.638]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, Robert Barnes guest hosting.
[01:51:07.478 --> 01:51:13.360]  Up a little bit later, the effort to unravel who exactly was on that Epstein list.
[01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:23.524]  Efforts are being made in court to finally expose who was on Epstein's list, who was in Epstein's little black book that they hid during the Ghislaine Maxwell trial.
[01:51:24.204 --> 01:51:41.552]  And we'll be discussing that and more, and discuss maybe a little bit of the background of Ghislaine Maxwell, and why Epstein may have actually been recruited into the Maxwell extortion and blackmail ring, rather than be the one who recruited Maxwell into it, involving a little story about her father.
[01:51:42.012 --> 01:51:45.774]  Might even involve a brief little story about Bill Barr and his dad.
[01:51:46.624 --> 01:51:51.786]  But before that, a good article in Compact Magazine today by Michael Anton.
[01:51:51.846 --> 01:52:07.315]   Michael Anton is a great scholar and intellectual associated with both Hillsdale and Claremont, has been one of the key advocates for Trump all the way back to the 2016 campaign, and he wrote a good article entitled They can't let him back in.
[01:52:07.675 --> 01:52:09.516]  This is at Compact Magazine.
[01:52:10.117 --> 01:52:12.338]  And what does Michael Anton mean?
[01:52:12.378 --> 01:52:14.099]  Well, let's read from part of the article.
[01:52:14.719 --> 01:52:27.705]   The people who really run the United States of America have made it clear that they can't and won't If they can help it, allow Donald Trump to be president again.
[01:52:28.325 --> 01:52:32.766]  In fact, they've made this clear many, many, many times.
[01:52:33.346 --> 01:52:40.109]  And he goes through what's really behind all of this, and that it's a real threat, and a plausible threat, and a credible threat to Trump.
[01:52:40.489 --> 01:52:53.762]   Because what you're really seeing, if you want a parallel, go back and look at Axios' article from a couple of weeks ago, where Axios outed that people around Trump are planning and coordinating to take out the deep state
[01:52:53.762 --> 01:52:56.551]   when and if Trump gets back in.
[01:52:56.551 --> 01:53:00.671]  And why is that significant?
[01:53:00.671 --> 01:53:02.032]  That's really a signal.
[01:53:02.032 --> 01:53:04.292]  It isn't Trump's people who are leaking that.
[01:53:04.292 --> 01:53:09.551]   That is a signal to the deep state that Trump is coming for the deep state.
[01:53:09.551 --> 01:53:11.871]  Now why does that matter?
[01:53:11.967 --> 01:53:24.896]  Our interview yesterday with Mark Grobaer went into some details about why it mattered because it parallels what the deep state was up to during the presidential campaign of one Robert Francis Kennedy in 1968.
[01:53:25.237 --> 01:53:25.837]  And how did that end?
[01:53:28.459 --> 01:53:31.763]  So it's the same perilous threat to the President.
[01:53:31.903 --> 01:53:36.508]  An effort first will be made to indict him and to remove him by other legal means.
[01:53:37.009 --> 01:53:40.813]  The other effort that has already been afoot for the last year has been January 6th.
[01:53:40.833 --> 01:53:45.538]  I mean basically what you have had since arguably August of 2016.
[01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:50.641]  Is a continuous effort of a coup against Donald Trump.
[01:53:51.041 --> 01:54:01.264]  First to prevent his campaign from being successful in 2016, then multiple efforts to derail his presidency beginning from the day he got elected.
[01:54:01.684 --> 01:54:03.645]  Indeed, from the day he got nominated.
[01:54:04.085 --> 01:54:05.846]  Some of this goes all the way back to March of 2016.
[01:54:05.906 --> 01:54:11.510]  This has been a continuous effort to destroy the presidency of Donald Trump.
[01:54:12.090 --> 01:54:12.430]  Why?
[01:54:12.691 --> 01:54:14.372]  To protect the deep state.
[01:54:14.752 --> 01:54:23.698]  When Michael Anton talks about those who really run America, you can make a reasonable inference as to who it is he is in fact talking about.
[01:54:24.298 --> 01:54:29.980]  And for people out there that sometimes question what the Deep State is, the Deep State actually has an old history.
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:45.966]  It goes back to The Economist, a writer for The Economist in the 19th century, late 1800s, trying to describe what was happening to Britain in the rise of its colonial empire as to how so much of its government could be immune and impervious from public will and public opinion.
[01:54:46.366 --> 01:54:49.828]  And the reason was because a dual state had developed.
[01:54:50.228 --> 01:54:52.329]  One that was elected, one that wasn't.
[01:54:52.769 --> 01:55:04.935]  And this administrative dual state increasingly governed actual well-being of government policies without regard to what the public wanted or insisted upon or whom even they elected.
[01:55:05.695 --> 01:55:24.568]  The same pattern continued, and when the various German philosophers and political scientists escaped Nazi Germany, they tried to understand the rise of fascism in both Italy and Germany, and they concluded it was the same dual state administrative state apparatus that facilitated the rise of Nazism and fascism in Europe.
[01:55:25.248 --> 01:55:45.024]  In the same vein, it was the left historian Peter Dale Scott in the late 1960s who used the phrase, how do you explain the dual state when it has national security power, when it has military power, when it has law enforcement power, when it's at the top of the political hierarchy of our law enforcement and military institutions?
[01:55:45.405 --> 01:55:48.267]  Well, really it's a dual state that is deeply entrenched.
[01:55:48.687 --> 01:55:50.269]  In other words, a deep state.
[01:55:50.729 --> 01:55:52.530]  And that's where the term originated.
[01:55:52.551 --> 01:55:55.693]  Some people think it originated with Turkey in the 2000s.
[01:55:55.713 --> 01:55:56.293]  That's not true.
[01:55:56.574 --> 01:56:11.285]  It originated in the West to describe England, to describe fascism, to describe the United States, and what Eisenhower himself called the military-industrial complex when he left in his exit address in 1961.
[01:56:11.325 --> 01:56:14.007]  So that's what Anton is talking about.
[01:56:14.567 --> 01:56:20.172]  The reason for the Axios piece, the reason for these other stories, is it's the deep state preparing to take out Trump.
[01:56:20.652 --> 01:56:25.652]   And so they tried to throughout his presidency, didn't impeach him just once, they impeached him twice,
[01:56:25.652 --> 01:56:31.771]   tried to get him indicted through Robert Mueller, tried to coerce and extort different policy promises
[01:56:31.771 --> 01:56:37.652]   during his presidency with the threat of Robert Mueller going after family members and friends and allies,
[01:56:37.652 --> 01:56:44.072]   was successful to use the Robert Mueller investigation and inquiry in order to remove General Flynn
[01:56:44.072 --> 01:56:49.271]   and his allies from the administration so the deep state could have more carte blanche control
[01:56:49.271 --> 01:56:52.072]  in terms of actual administrative policy on the grounds.
[01:56:52.072 --> 01:56:53.770]  They've all admitted this afterwards.
[01:56:53.770 --> 01:56:56.971]   Different generals have admitted that they lied and betrayed the president
[01:56:56.971 --> 01:57:00.411]   in terms of what was happening in Syria, that they lied and betrayed the president
[01:57:00.411 --> 01:57:03.891]   in terms of what was happening in Iran, that they lied and betrayed the president
[01:57:03.891 --> 01:57:07.652]   in terms of what was happening in Afghanistan, that they lied and betrayed the president
[01:57:07.652 --> 01:57:09.452]  about what was going on in Ukraine.
[01:57:09.597 --> 01:57:19.783]  Not only that, we now know, as Deborah Birx has freely and fully admitted in her little book tour, she lied repeatedly to the Trump administration in terms of COVID policy and lockdown policies.
[01:57:20.104 --> 01:57:23.566]  We already know Anthony Fauci did because he was caught lying just earlier this week.
[01:57:24.066 --> 01:57:36.152]  So these deep state actors were able to undermine the president's campaign and the president's actual ability to be the chief officer of the executive branch of the United States government.
[01:57:36.592 --> 01:57:38.933]  And then that culminated of course in the stolen election of 2020.
[01:57:40.114 --> 01:57:50.043]  They hoped that January 6th would be sufficiently explosive that they could use January 6th to permanently discredit Trump and permanently discredit Trump supporters.
[01:57:50.564 --> 01:57:57.651]  They believed some of the things that were being put up on social media message boards that this would truly get out of hand and they facilitated it.
[01:57:58.211 --> 01:58:01.492]  By withdrawing the number of security that should have been present.
[01:58:01.832 --> 01:58:03.873]  By not having the National Guard present.
[01:58:04.113 --> 01:58:04.754]  Same D.C.
[01:58:04.794 --> 01:58:08.655]  mayor now wants the National Guard to deal with illegal immigration being sent her way.
[01:58:09.115 --> 01:58:12.056]  Tells you what they were really up to.
[01:58:12.216 --> 01:58:14.197]  By actually provoking some of the incidents.
[01:58:14.237 --> 01:58:21.420]  By having instigators, informants, and infiltrators amongst the crowd to make sure it went in a certain direction.
[01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:23.761]  But it never got as violent as they wanted it to be.
[01:58:24.361 --> 01:58:27.283]  Most people are simply being charged with misdemeanor trespass.
[01:58:27.803 --> 01:58:33.986]  More than 99% of the people that went there aren't being charged with anything, because they didn't do anything wrong.
[01:58:34.527 --> 01:58:46.113]  There's very few people being charged with any kind of violence, and the only victims that day, in terms of dying, were people who were part of the rally, not anybody that was part of the Capitol Police.
[01:58:46.133 --> 01:58:52.097]  It was people that were killed by members of Capitol Police and others that were associated with security at the Hill.
[01:58:52.697 --> 01:58:54.118]  They thought that would take out Trump.
[01:58:54.158 --> 01:58:54.598]  Didn't work.
[01:58:55.078 --> 01:58:59.020]  So then they go next with the January 6th committee hearings and they hope that will take out Trump.
[01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:00.161]  It has not worked.
[01:59:00.621 --> 01:59:09.726]  That is why they're looking at escalating now to trying to maybe indict Trump with the Justice Department in the District of Columbia or the DA in Fulton County, Georgia, or both.
[01:59:10.848 --> 01:59:13.010]  Problem is, they don't have a case.
[01:59:13.571 --> 01:59:20.459]  It is your legal constitutional right to have your own electors, your own contingent set of electors, when you file an electoral contest.
[01:59:20.899 --> 01:59:27.707]  I was part of the President's election legal team in Georgia during a key part of that, and that is entirely constitutionally correct.
[01:59:28.007 --> 01:59:29.790]  That's not a crime by any stretch.
[01:59:30.350 --> 01:59:32.152]  So ultimately, that will fall apart.
[01:59:32.672 --> 01:59:36.055]  And then the question becomes, what do they try and do next?
[01:59:36.515 --> 01:59:43.421]  And the point of Michael Anton's article is that Trump and everybody around Trump should be prepared and ready to deal with that.
[01:59:43.982 --> 01:59:47.024]  But he also explains what the real objections are.
[01:59:47.865 --> 01:59:52.073]  Anti-Trump hysteria is, in the final analysis, not about Trump.
[01:59:52.634 --> 01:59:57.823]  The regime can't allow Trump to be president, just like they can't allow Alex Jones to be on the air.
[01:59:58.464 --> 02:00:00.047]  Not because of who he is.
[02:00:00.894 --> 02:00:04.896]  Although that greats them, but because of who his followers are.
[02:00:05.536 --> 02:00:16.302]  That class, the country class, must not be allowed representation by candidates who might implement their preferences, which also and above all must never be allowed.
[02:00:16.982 --> 02:00:24.266]  The rubes have no standing to affect the outcome of a political process because we are just the rubes and the elites are the ones who should govern.
[02:00:25.026 --> 02:00:30.447]  That's what the attacks on Trump are all about, just like that's what the attacks on Alex Jones are all about.
[02:00:30.827 --> 02:00:32.668]  It's an attack on you, the people.
[02:00:33.048 --> 02:00:43.150]  And that is why as long as you continue to hold the line and stay at the front of the line by supporting InfoWars at InfoWarsStore.com, their ability to break us won't happen.
[02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:45.791]  So hold the line, and we'll be back after the break.
[02:00:46.711 --> 02:00:50.112]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, Robert Barnes guest hosting.
[02:00:50.993 --> 02:01:05.217]  A reminder to everybody, if you want to continue to support InfoWars, or simply find products you like, you need, you deserve to have, you can have at an affordable price, InfoWarsStore.com provides all of them, a wide range of products for anything.
[02:01:05.897 --> 02:01:13.879]  Most of these are products that you use on an everyday basis, so it's just getting the best quality for the best price, while also supporting InfoWars.
[02:01:14.139 --> 02:01:16.239]  It makes you healthier, wealthier, and wiser.
[02:01:16.259 --> 02:01:19.220]  It's the simplest, best choice you're probably ever going to make.
[02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:25.503]  And you are the front line that continues to protect InfoWars from the mass assault taking place.
[02:01:26.164 --> 02:01:45.234]  One of the stories that InfoWars constantly covered that other people said couldn't possibly be true is high-ranking elites running secret blackmail extortion rings involving underage and other criminal activity involving sexual deviancy and either young girls or others.
[02:01:45.874 --> 02:01:50.156]  Well, of course, we all now know that the Jeffrey Epstein case was no fake case.
[02:01:50.776 --> 02:01:51.677]  It was a real case.
[02:01:51.917 --> 02:01:58.760]  Now, of course, Epstein himself magically managed to kill himself in a prison cell that was designed so that you couldn't kill yourself.
[02:01:59.281 --> 02:02:03.143]  But, of course, we can't know it really happened because the cameras magically malfunctioned that day.
[02:02:03.883 --> 02:02:06.245]  Elaine Maxwell has now been convicted at trial.
[02:02:06.865 --> 02:02:12.029]  And the question is, what was in a black book that was introduced at trial but all the names redacted?
[02:02:12.449 --> 02:02:16.012]  Was it a black book that includes Jeffrey Epstein's client list?
[02:02:16.652 --> 02:02:23.117]  To understand the sort of further background of the Epstein dynamic is, Epstein may not have been the one to recruit Maxwell.
[02:02:23.257 --> 02:02:25.159]  She may have been the one to recruit him.
[02:02:25.899 --> 02:02:26.179]  Why?
[02:02:26.279 --> 02:02:36.406]  Because there were rumors for quite some time that Elaine Maxwell's father, Robert Maxwell, was involved in a range of illicit activities and spy services around the globe.
[02:02:36.546 --> 02:02:42.910]  Connected to MI6, connected to Mossad, connected to the KGB, connected to the CIA.
[02:02:43.251 --> 02:02:55.399]  He seemed to be sort of a deep state gray space man, a middle man if you will, operating at the behest and on the behalf of institutional insiders and intelligence services around the globe.
[02:02:55.979 --> 02:02:58.880]  He mysteriously died by falling off his boat.
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:02.601]  Happened right around the time he might have started out certain secrets.
[02:03:03.062 --> 02:03:18.147]  Not long after that is when Epstein shows up doing the deals he's doing with certain people, including with Victoria's Secret founder and others, and ultimately suddenly having a magical wealth of magical life of magical wealth.
[02:03:18.567 --> 02:03:37.802]  Well, you know, a huge ranch in New Mexico, the beautiful mansion in New York City, the entire island in the Caribbean, his own private plane, the Epstein Express, a particular favorite of one William Jefferson Clinton, and then later all everything was outed after it was initially and originally covered up.
[02:03:38.482 --> 02:03:58.533]  In the early 2000s about his involvement with many underage girls and other illicit human trafficking activities for which he was ultimately charged only after public outrage then mysteriously died while waiting trial and now Ghislaine Maxwell is in prison and the question is what was in those files that got redacted by the court?
[02:03:59.173 --> 02:04:05.616]  What else is in the government's discovery that might disclose if you're involved in a trafficking ring, well, who are you trafficking to?
[02:04:05.636 --> 02:04:06.457]  Who are the clients?
[02:04:06.477 --> 02:04:07.217]  Who are the customers?
[02:04:07.637 --> 02:04:12.820]  Well, Gateway Pundit is taking legal action to try to find that out.
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:26.807]  They have retained counsel and are filing in court requests to unseal a range of file and documents, much as Mike Cernovich had previously done in New York to unmask aspects of what was taking place in the Epstein case.
[02:04:27.327 --> 02:04:32.049]  So hopefully we will finally see some information about where these trails will lead.
[02:04:32.589 --> 02:04:39.612]  Now at the same time, another man, another movie was made about, maybe just about to be released back to Russia.
[02:04:40.272 --> 02:04:44.054]  A movie years ago called The Lords of War with Nicolas Cage.
[02:04:44.674 --> 02:04:53.100]  It was a thinly disguised biography of one of the world's most famous arms runners and gun runners around the globe.
[02:04:53.620 --> 02:05:01.726]  Now he was on all sides, and as famously portrayed in the movie, that appeared to afford him an extraordinary degree of unique immunity.
[02:05:02.446 --> 02:05:07.848]  But later on he became, apparently according to the CIA, a little too buddy-buddy with Putin.
[02:05:08.388 --> 02:05:09.289]  And so the U.S.
[02:05:09.349 --> 02:05:12.090]  government basically, as the court later would admit, set him up.
[02:05:12.490 --> 02:05:13.230]  They entrapped him.
[02:05:13.591 --> 02:05:17.172]  They entrapped him in a case that he wouldn't have otherwise been involved with but for the entrapment.
[02:05:17.332 --> 02:05:18.313]  Classic definition of it.
[02:05:18.673 --> 02:05:20.874]  But no federal judge is going to take it on the CIA.
[02:05:21.194 --> 02:05:26.376]  So even though the judge said, gave him the minimum sentence, but the minimum sentence was 25 years because of entrapment.
[02:05:26.756 --> 02:05:42.103]  So apparently we're going to send the Lord of War back to Russia in exchange for a WNBA player who appeared to have been actually kind of trafficking, given the amount of money, the amount of drugs provided, but at a minimum was smuggling illegal drugs into Russia.
[02:05:42.503 --> 02:05:58.991]   But because she's popular with the woke community and the five or six fans who actually follow the WNBA in America, that has been enough to influence the Biden administration as well as a person who some suspect Might have been a CIA tied or connected who was also in Russian jail.
[02:05:59.292 --> 02:06:06.236]  Those two will be released, primarily the big names, the WNBA star, in exchange for sending the Lord of War right back to Russia.
[02:06:06.696 --> 02:06:08.817]  That shows you how the world really operates.
[02:06:09.257 --> 02:06:16.742]  But on the white pill front, a big, huge settlement out of Illinois in the vaccine mandate context.
[02:06:17.202 --> 02:06:26.791]  The great lawyers at Liberty Council brought a major claim against a health care provider who had discriminated and denied all religious objections and accommodations.
[02:06:27.271 --> 02:06:31.530]   And for those folks that don't know, remember Title VII of the Civil Rights Act entitles
[02:06:31.530 --> 02:06:36.211]   you to object on religious grounds, and that doesn't require permission or approval from
[02:06:36.211 --> 02:06:37.931]  any particular religious leader.
[02:06:37.931 --> 02:06:39.291]  You don't have to go to church.
[02:06:39.291 --> 02:06:41.332]  You don't even have to be a theist.
[02:06:41.332 --> 02:06:43.851]  It's simply a belief of conscience.
[02:06:43.851 --> 02:06:48.731]   So if your conscience believes that it's wrong to go forward with any particular medication
[02:06:48.731 --> 02:06:54.851]   or other invasion of your body, then you can assert an objection to any vaccine mandate
[02:06:54.851 --> 02:07:00.051]   in your employment context, also can apply to the government, also can apply to various
[02:07:00.051 --> 02:07:02.971]  public accommodations as well.
[02:07:02.971 --> 02:07:07.971]   So in that context, they were denied their religious accommodation objections by a medical
[02:07:07.971 --> 02:07:09.412]  facility in Illinois.
[02:07:09.500 --> 02:07:14.063]  So, Liberty Council brought a substantial class action challenging what they were doing.
[02:07:14.423 --> 02:07:18.325]  Well, announced today in federal court a massive settlement.
[02:07:18.425 --> 02:07:21.526]  They're going to have to pay more than $10 million.
[02:07:21.887 --> 02:07:28.110]  The employer who denied all of these accommodations is going to have to write a $10 million plus check.
[02:07:28.670 --> 02:07:30.692]  To the lawyers and the people.
[02:07:30.712 --> 02:07:36.115]  I mean, almost all that money will go to the employees who got screwed and shafted out of what took place.
[02:07:36.476 --> 02:07:39.298]  In some cases, some will be making, you know, getting as much as almost $300,000.
[02:07:39.698 --> 02:07:46.763]  So that they're going to get rewarded and compensated for the damages that they suffered from their employers' wrongful action.
[02:07:47.243 --> 02:07:53.928]  Not only that, the employers being effectively deterred from doing this ever again in the future by the nature of the settlement agreement.
[02:07:54.328 --> 02:07:59.247]   And this will send shockwaves throughout the private employment universe that thought they
[02:07:59.247 --> 02:08:00.547]  were immune.
[02:08:00.547 --> 02:08:01.868]  And why was that?
[02:08:01.868 --> 02:08:06.767]   Because a lot of private employers, the big corporate employers, the Tyson Foods of the
[02:08:06.767 --> 02:08:11.288]  world, take their legal advice from big corporate law firms.
[02:08:11.288 --> 02:08:16.408]   But they probably should have double-checked who was on the list of the customers and clients
[02:08:16.408 --> 02:08:18.468]  of those big corporate law firms.
[02:08:18.468 --> 02:08:22.768]   What was some of the favorite investments of some of those big corporate law firms?
[02:08:22.768 --> 02:08:26.867]   Because if they had, they would have found conflicts of interest.
[02:08:26.867 --> 02:08:31.928]   Many of the big corporate law firms that gave bad advice to corporate employers to try to
[02:08:31.928 --> 02:08:37.428]   impose this vaccine mandate in the first place, and then not to recognize religious and medical
[02:08:37.428 --> 02:08:44.748]   accommodations either, also either have partners who invest in or actually have clients who
[02:08:44.748 --> 02:08:46.267]  are big pharma.
[02:08:46.719 --> 02:08:48.240]  So they had a conflict of interest.
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:54.563]  They were serving the interest of their big pharma client at the expense of the interest of their private employer client.
[02:08:55.143 --> 02:09:05.553]  And because of that, they made bad advice and took bad tactics and made bad decisions, and people filed righteous suits that are now starting to see vindication and validation in the courts.
[02:09:06.113 --> 02:09:19.786]  Similarly, in the military context, a federal court has issued a permanent injunction against any efforts to mandate or discipline anyone for not following the vaccine mandate who asserted a religious accommodation in the Air Force.
[02:09:21.667 --> 02:09:26.772]  This is going to be repeated across the country, in my view, ultimately.
[02:09:27.232 --> 02:09:38.101]  Every member of the military will ultimately be protected from disciplinary action, at least as it relates to their employment and future benefits in the military, maybe not for deployment.
[02:09:40.383 --> 02:09:44.245]  Uh, Kavanaugh, unfortunately, carved out a moment of temporary exception for.
[02:09:44.525 --> 02:10:02.411]  But as to everything else, I think the religious accommodation protections will ultimately be enforced as we are seeing and as we saw yesterday in another federal court striking down Biden's attempt to impose a vaccine mandate without regard to religious accommodations and religious objections and religious beliefs in the military.
[02:10:02.531 --> 02:10:07.393]  This is the second big permanent injunction win after the one in Texas for Navy SEALs.
[02:10:07.833 --> 02:10:14.218]  So you're going to see this extended and you're going to see this expanded as these cases progress and proceed through the judicial process.
[02:10:14.739 --> 02:10:32.174]  In fact, that's why I put up a template of an example of a letter that people could use all the way back at vivabarneslaw.locals.com that people could find and see what is the language that has been found to be legally correct and legally appropriate for asserting religious accommodations.
[02:10:32.614 --> 02:10:35.973]   uh... against employer mandates but those few employers that continue to
[02:10:35.973 --> 02:10:39.564]   hold out should look at that case should look at that ten million
[02:10:39.564 --> 02:10:43.774]   dollar plus settlement is a settlement i mean it is one even an ultimate verdict
[02:10:43.774 --> 02:10:46.533]   ten million dollar plus settlement and ask themselves
[02:10:46.533 --> 02:10:51.094]   where they want to continue to go down that path or whether they want to finally recognize in respect
[02:10:51.094 --> 02:10:52.534]   religious accommodations
[02:10:52.534 --> 02:10:56.614]   bring back those employees they tried to wrongfully terminate payout checks to
[02:10:56.614 --> 02:11:00.734]   those they did wrongfully terminate and restore the constitution's rights
[02:11:00.734 --> 02:11:04.293]   and the right of religious liberty in the private employment context
[02:11:04.293 --> 02:11:10.490]   as the law demands We'll be back after the break with another hour, and remember, continue to hold the line.

[02:13:19.202 --> 02:13:34.521]   I gotta tell you, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[02:13:34.521 --> 02:13:37.842]   the left and the mainstream media are going to have to sit there
[02:13:37.842 --> 02:13:41.842]  And we've got to force them to respond to this book.
[02:13:42.265 --> 02:13:43.967]  This book is that important.
[02:13:44.007 --> 02:13:45.928]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter.
[02:13:46.289 --> 02:13:59.739]   If you compare the finest, and I'm telling you, you take MIT Technology Review, you take Science, take all these magazines and journals, add the electronic part of it, and, you know, NPR, PBS, all of it, I'll take it.
[02:14:00.019 --> 02:14:07.042]  I'll match up and we'll go through and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there.
[02:14:07.282 --> 02:14:11.364]  And if you're a sentient human being and just watching it, you say, well, God, Alex Jones was ahead of this.
[02:14:11.404 --> 02:14:12.604]  Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[02:14:12.684 --> 02:14:14.905]  They're just in this huge revolution.
[02:14:15.525 --> 02:14:22.324]   against choice and free will and normal technological development and adoption of technology that empowers
[02:14:22.324 --> 02:14:23.025]  humanity.
[02:14:23.025 --> 02:14:30.525]   Instead, they want adoption of technology, forced adoption, world IDs, global social credit scores, carbon taxes,
[02:14:30.525 --> 02:14:33.525]  that dominate and monitor every facet of our lives.
[02:14:33.525 --> 02:14:38.025]   You make the case of what the not just the new world order is,
[02:14:38.025 --> 02:14:44.525]   but using this great reset to really take up their whole idea of control and authoritarianism.
[02:14:44.769 --> 02:14:54.013]  They have decided to trigger a controlled collapse and then bring in a new dark age to control the general public where they will be in their Elysium fields.
[02:14:54.273 --> 02:14:56.534]  There is no new technology coming in.
[02:14:56.554 --> 02:14:57.374]  They're blocking that.
[02:14:57.974 --> 02:15:03.997]  And so really they're just imploding things under the Clarence Pippen model to show that they can get that control over us.
[02:15:04.377 --> 02:15:06.318]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter.
[02:15:06.378 --> 02:15:19.263]  He has presented tons of valid evidence and facts that I think have been really, really important to raising consciousness to what this sort of technocratic global elite really want to do.
[02:15:19.703 --> 02:15:28.727]   The true thing that you've done, which is stunning, If you look at the evidence of that and the facts, you are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:15:29.308 --> 02:15:30.208]  That is very rare.
[02:15:30.248 --> 02:15:33.850]  You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[02:15:34.690 --> 02:15:41.353]  This book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, I'm telling you, everybody in America, the people that hate Alex Jones the most have to read this book.
[02:15:41.913 --> 02:15:42.894]  This is no beach read.
[02:15:43.534 --> 02:15:44.734]  You're not going to be flipping pages here.
[02:15:44.754 --> 02:15:47.275]  You're going to be having a pen out and you're going to be underlining stuff.
[02:15:47.375 --> 02:15:47.975]  It's amazing.
[02:15:48.495 --> 02:15:52.536]  The Great Reset and the War for the World by Alex Jones.
[02:15:52.916 --> 02:15:57.257]  Available now on Amazon or Infowarsstore.com.
[02:15:57.497 --> 02:15:58.797]  Liberals now are all over the news.
[02:15:59.017 --> 02:16:04.398]  They're the newest, biggest group buying guns saying, I'm preparing for civil war with the right-wingers.
[02:16:04.538 --> 02:16:07.039]  Thank God you just joined us and didn't know it.
[02:16:07.079 --> 02:16:09.279]  The Second Amendment is for a tyrannical government.
[02:16:11.713 --> 02:16:13.014]  That is your body is rising!
[02:16:13.234 --> 02:16:16.395]  If you won't stand up and get ready, you won't be in play.
[02:16:16.735 --> 02:16:51.634]   If you're proud and moving, they will push you around and [music]
[02:16:51.945 --> 02:16:52.965]  They've sold out to it.
[02:16:53.025 --> 02:16:54.366]  They're blind and they're cowards.
[02:16:54.406 --> 02:16:56.007]  You don't want to be part of them.
[02:16:56.067 --> 02:16:58.249]  Like Patrick Henry says, forget you are our brethren.
[02:16:58.469 --> 02:16:59.790]  Go from us in peace.
[02:17:00.170 --> 02:17:02.732]  Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you.
[02:17:02.932 --> 02:17:06.454]  Let your chain sit lightly upon you.
[02:17:06.493 --> 02:17:10.493]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[02:17:10.493 --> 02:17:17.493]  [crowd cheering]
[02:17:17.493 --> 02:17:22.493]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:17:22.493 --> 02:17:25.493]  [music]
[02:17:26.142 --> 02:17:31.967]  Welcome back to InfoWars, this is an Alex Jones Show hosted by Robert Barnes.
[02:17:32.968 --> 02:17:38.513]  More information coming out of the continued debacle and disaster that is the war in Ukraine.
[02:17:39.548 --> 02:17:49.859]  In this latest report, it appears that American-supplied weapons were used by Ukraine to bomb their own prisoners held in Russian territory.
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:18:11.122]   In other words, this is a place where various members of the Azov Battalion and various Ukrainian soldiers were being held as either prisoners of war Or in some cases, prisoners under the local authority of the various Donbass locally organized militias and governments that felt that some of these people had committed crimes against them leading up to the conflict.
[02:18:11.743 --> 02:18:18.290]  Well, apparently, Ukraine, using American-provided weapons, has bombed it and killed a bunch of them.
[02:18:18.951 --> 02:18:20.872]  So there are three questions that arise.
[02:18:21.072 --> 02:18:26.256]  The first question is, was this done by accident, that Ukraine didn't know what was happening?
[02:18:26.876 --> 02:18:29.238]  Second, was it somehow not done by Ukraine?
[02:18:29.418 --> 02:18:34.221]  Why would Russia do this on its own territory, or territory it controls?
[02:18:34.862 --> 02:18:38.204]  And third, could it have been done deliberately by Ukraine?
[02:18:38.829 --> 02:18:51.892]  Well, the latter part can't be completely ruled out because of the very unusual politics we have in Ukraine, and the unusual dynamics of who some of those people were that were being held in custody.
[02:18:52.552 --> 02:19:07.055]  So, the Assof Battalion dates back to a range of neo-Nazi militias formed to perpetuate the Maidan Revolution in 2014 in Ukraine, but it has an even longer heritage and history.
[02:19:07.595 --> 02:19:11.297]  In fact, you could arguably go all the way back a century, to the 1920s.
[02:19:11.897 --> 02:19:20.221]  So the land of Ukraine, in the language of Russian, literally means, and other languages actually, actually means just borderlands.
[02:19:20.541 --> 02:19:24.062]  It was always the borderlands between competing great empires.
[02:19:24.443 --> 02:19:33.327]  The Russian Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Polish-Lithuanian Empire, and so forth, and occasionally the German Empire.
[02:19:33.847 --> 02:19:35.968]  And as well, the Ottoman-Turkish Empire.
[02:19:36.548 --> 02:19:40.010]  So this borderlands was made up of a wide range of people.
[02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:53.239]  You had Cossacks in the east, you had Russians in part of the country, you had Ukrainians in other parts of the country, you had Turks and Greeks in Odessa and other parts along the border next to the Black Sea.
[02:19:54.060 --> 02:19:56.261]  You had Romanians in another part of the country.
[02:19:56.402 --> 02:20:16.858]   Indeed, Deputy Premier Medvedev, the former President of Russia, recently put out two maps, and one map had a map of what he thinks Zelensky thinks is going to have happen, and somebody made a meme of it, of basically someone taking cocaine and making a map of Ukraine, all the way back to being old Ukraine plus Crimea.
[02:20:17.538 --> 02:20:33.241]  And then he put up what he thinks the West wants to do with the map, or really thinks is going to happen with the map, and much of it was divvied up between Poland, and Romania, and Hungaria, and Hungary, and then Russia, and then just a little bit around Kiev, that would actually be Ukraine.
[02:20:34.002 --> 02:20:56.067]   That history reflects a long history that's unique to Ukraine, but as it relates to the potential for this to have been a deliberate attack by Ukrainian military officials on their own army members, and particularly Azov battalion members being held prisoner in Russia, is that they might have had information That they didn't want publicly exposed.
[02:20:56.147 --> 02:21:17.127]  Remember the Assaf Battalion was holding out for a long time in Mariupol, under that factory, even without basic food and medicine until they find, and there were multiple ridiculously desperate efforts to help people escape from there, including helicopters that would go in and get shot down, other attempts that would completely fail, efforts by sea that would fail.
[02:21:17.768 --> 02:21:28.492]  So there was clearly an obsession, so much so that many people speculated that maybe what is in there is some prominent French or other general or British or American general may be down there.
[02:21:28.532 --> 02:21:30.013]  That did not turn out to be the case.
[02:21:30.033 --> 02:21:35.995]  So the question is, what was it they wanted to hide to keep those Assaf battalion members from surrendering?
[02:21:36.515 --> 02:21:38.636]  Well, then they did ultimately surrender.
[02:21:38.676 --> 02:21:43.017]  They pretended it was like a retreat or something, but they surrendered unconditionally.
[02:21:43.598 --> 02:21:47.319]  And then they were ultimately are going to be going on trial.
[02:21:48.040 --> 02:21:51.123]  Uh, or maybe sent back to Ukraine in a prisoner swap.
[02:21:51.784 --> 02:21:58.813]  So why would they might want to kill their own Assaf Battalion members and soldiers now that they're in Russian captivity?
[02:21:59.373 --> 02:22:01.276]  What might they know that might be a problem?
[02:22:01.856 --> 02:22:03.839]  Well, this goes all the way back to the long history.
[02:22:03.838 --> 02:22:10.039]   of the rise of fascism within the Western Ukrainian ultra-nationalism that began in
[02:22:10.039 --> 02:22:14.478]   the late teens and in the early twenties that was a different brand of Ukrainian nationalism
[02:22:14.478 --> 02:22:17.818]   than existed in the eastern and central parts of the country.
[02:22:17.818 --> 02:22:22.318]   It was in fact many people in the central and eastern part of Ukraine wanted nothing
[02:22:22.318 --> 02:22:31.318]   to do with this ultra-nationalistic quasi-fascistic mechanism that was being promoted by the ultra-nationalist
[02:22:31.318 --> 02:22:34.279]  under Stepan Bendera and others.
[02:22:34.279 --> 02:22:39.597]   They would go in the 1920s they would wage mostly war against the Poles who had disparate
[02:22:39.597 --> 02:22:43.939]   influence in that part of Ukraine, try to assassinate and successfully kill various
[02:22:43.939 --> 02:22:49.798]   Polish leaders leading to the arrest of Stepan Bendera and others and that and then ultimately
[02:22:49.798 --> 02:22:54.998]   Bendera would be released by the Nazis when the Nazis went into Ukraine and the Ukrainian
[02:22:54.998 --> 02:23:00.359]   ultra-nationalist of the Bendera or the Benderaites as they're called ultimately aligned with
[02:23:00.359 --> 02:23:04.518]  the Nazis and committed some of the most horrific...
[02:23:03.387 --> 02:23:08.552]  Uh, violations of human rights and basic liberty that could be imagined in World War II.
[02:23:09.032 --> 02:23:12.956]  To give you an idea of how bad it was, even the Nazis thought it was horrendous.
[02:23:13.116 --> 02:23:15.378]  The Nazis were like, that's a little too far!
[02:23:15.998 --> 02:23:19.662]  If it goes a little too far for the Nazis, maybe you've gone a little too far.
[02:23:20.382 --> 02:23:22.783]  Uh, that was the nature of the Banderite divisions.
[02:23:23.083 --> 02:23:37.990]  After the end of World War II, the CIA recruited Stepan Bandera, the CIA recruited many of the neo-Nazis, the CIA actually recruited actual Nazis, created a spy network in Central and Eastern Europe that was made up of ex-Nazis.
[02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:45.392]  So Nazis or fascists or their allies were a critical part of what was going on with the CIA in Europe.
[02:23:45.752 --> 02:23:57.576]  They had a whole group that they left behind to try to be able to, theoretically, to defend against the Russian and Soviet invasion, but in fact to actually promote destabilization regimes they didn't like.
[02:23:58.056 --> 02:23:59.636]  This happened in a range of countries.
[02:23:59.656 --> 02:24:02.157]  There were specific names of operations given to this.
[02:24:02.557 --> 02:24:07.739]  Blew up in different places in Italy in the early 1980s with a wide range of scandals connected to it.
[02:24:08.399 --> 02:24:13.662]  But part of that group was the ultra-nationalist neo-Nazis of Western Ukraine.
[02:24:14.263 --> 02:24:17.404]  So, Soviet Union collapses, what does the West do?
[02:24:17.424 --> 02:24:19.786]  It re-engages that same group.
[02:24:19.886 --> 02:24:41.478]   Indeed, the principal propagandist for some of the ideas now believed by all kinds of Ukrainian nationalists were actually propagated by Harvard and other institutions in the West associated with this ultra-nationalist fascistic neo-Nazi regime, including the myth The Soviet famine was designed to target Ukrainians by ethnicity.
[02:24:41.918 --> 02:24:42.559]  Utterly false.
[02:24:43.019 --> 02:24:51.883]  The famines that took place under Stalin, in fact there were famines that took place under Lenin, were a combination of incompetency and an attempt to attack independent peasant farmers.
[02:24:52.323 --> 02:24:55.345]  And the primary targets were Cossacks and Kulaks.
[02:24:55.925 --> 02:24:57.546]  Not Ukrainians by ethnicity.
[02:24:57.586 --> 02:25:01.187]  In fact, more died on a per capita basis outside of Ukraine than died in Ukraine.
[02:25:01.588 --> 02:25:11.572]  The great journalist who covered this, who was exposing the fraud that the New York Times was at the time, never made it specific to Ukraine and made it clear it was across southern Russia.
[02:25:11.932 --> 02:25:17.195]  The black belt, wheat growing regions of Russia, as well as what is part of Ukraine.
[02:25:17.555 --> 02:25:22.177]  And it wasn't even very strong in the far western part of Ukraine, which is not the breadbasket of Ukraine anyway.
[02:25:22.677 --> 02:25:28.499]  So, but that mythology was built by the CIA allied groups and associates and institutions here in the West.
[02:25:29.039 --> 02:25:51.974]   So we re-engaged them in the early 90s, went into bed with them to help create the first color revolution in 2004, and when we got nervous that we needed better allies, George Soros, as he did when he was a kid, along with the CIA and other MI6 and other Western intelligence agencies and aligned groups, got together and helped back and propagate and support a
[02:25:51.974 --> 02:25:58.104]   rising neo-nazi militia group, often recruiting from prisons and recruiting hooligans from
[02:25:58.104 --> 02:26:04.874]   various soccer games and other mob-related groups. That's who created the Azov Battalion
[02:26:04.874 --> 02:26:14.014]   in 2014 with the aid of critical oligarchs in Ukraine to promote and propagate the Western
[02:26:14.014 --> 02:26:20.744]   agenda in Ukraine, using Ukraine as a de facto colony to engage in bioweapon experimentation and
[02:26:20.744 --> 02:26:25.604]   the destabilization of Russia because the globalists hate Russia because of their
[02:26:25.604 --> 02:26:31.763]   independence, because of Putin's unwillingness to engage in woke globalism and his dislike
[02:26:31.763 --> 02:26:32.144]  of it.
[02:26:32.330 --> 02:26:33.891]  Uh, at a fundamental and core level.
[02:26:34.211 --> 02:26:37.952]  Soros has hated Putin since, uh, for as long as anyone can remember.
[02:26:38.332 --> 02:26:39.913]  He hates Putin even more than he hates Trump.
[02:26:40.513 --> 02:26:50.396]  So the problem is somebody in that group that may have been in that prison, uh, and it may have just been one or two, but there's no better way to take somebody out than to take out a whole bunch of people to disguise what you're up to.
[02:26:50.836 --> 02:27:00.840]  So this accidental bombing by Ukraine of their own soldiers and the Azov battalion held in a prison in on Russian occupied territory.
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:06.142]  We can't rule out the possibility it was actually intentional and deliberate.
[02:27:06.862 --> 02:27:17.106]  When we come back, we're going to be discussing more vaccine deaths that keep happening or appear to be vaccine deaths for superstars and celebrities around the world.
[02:27:18.735 --> 02:27:20.416]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:27:20.456 --> 02:27:23.199]  This is Robert Barnes, guest hosting here in the fourth hour.
[02:27:24.239 --> 02:27:40.052]  What is fascinating to me in watching aspects of the trial, and it's part of been a broad-based conversation over the years, is the way in which InfoWars is demonized for providing its own independent products rather than hawking other people's products or whoring for Big Pharma and Corporate America.
[02:27:40.902 --> 02:27:42.622]  I've always found that fascinating.
[02:27:43.162 --> 02:28:04.987]  Almost every other media network and content creator out there that gets any form of advertising in order to be able to stay on the air, to do the time and to have the investment capital necessary to produce quality content for people to witness and see, and to be involved in on a participatory level, involves, requires, at some level, money from something.
[02:28:05.227 --> 02:28:13.046]   And the most common sources, like Fox News, CNN, mainstream media, the New York Times, comes from corporate advertisers.
[02:28:13.046 --> 02:28:18.247]   So your average content creator, your average so-called respectable journalist,
[02:28:18.247 --> 02:28:25.287]   is out there promoting a product that they've never vetted, that they can't conscientiously vouch for,
[02:28:25.287 --> 02:28:28.887]  that they have no idea if it's better for people.
[02:28:28.887 --> 02:28:31.527]   They don't know if it makes the world a better place or a worse place.
[02:28:31.761 --> 02:28:33.802]  They don't know if it's good for people or bad for people.
[02:28:34.082 --> 02:28:41.784]  They are often caught marketing, promoting, pitching, being sponsored by companies that are not promoting good products.
[02:28:41.804 --> 02:28:47.006]  They're products that either cost too much, are part of a scam, cause injury, cause harm, etc.
[02:28:47.506 --> 02:28:56.209]  One could think no further than the COVID-19 vaccines, as a product that has turned out that way, and they've hawked that directly and personally on the air, almost across the media spectrum.
[02:28:56.849 --> 02:29:18.715]  By contrast, what Alex Jones chose to do is to promote only products that he can personally vet, that he can personally and conscientiously vouch for, and that he has every reason to believe from his own lived experience will be better for the people who consume it, making people healthier, wealthier, and wiser in the process.
[02:29:19.215 --> 02:29:31.039]  That has struck me as always a much more rational and just means of supporting an independent content creator than cowering to Big Pharma and Big Corporate America.
[02:29:31.599 --> 02:29:39.622]  The other big, big, big difference, of course, and the real reason it drives them nuts, they're not really concerned about independent natural health.
[02:29:39.942 --> 02:29:48.285]  Though there was an implication in the courtroom yesterday that supplements are inherently bad, that they're untrustworthy, because those are not FDA-licensed products.
[02:29:48.945 --> 02:29:50.746]  And by the way, the FDA's history?
[02:29:50.886 --> 02:29:53.648]  The FDA started out as a marketing organization.
[02:29:54.048 --> 02:29:56.790]  They were not supposed to be a medicine organization.
[02:29:57.090 --> 02:30:00.012]  They were not supposed to be a scientific organization.
[02:30:00.373 --> 02:30:06.557]  They were supposed to make sure that the labels on the product match what is actually in the product.
[02:30:07.037 --> 02:30:13.082]  In other words, that if you bought kidney beans, you got kidney beans, not pinto beans, and so on and so forth.
[02:30:13.442 --> 02:30:20.848]  Because in the late 1800s, there were people committing overt fraud, putting something inside the can that ain't what they said on the outside of the can.
[02:30:21.508 --> 02:30:23.450]  But that was their sole and whole objective.
[02:30:23.470 --> 02:30:29.335]  They've gone way past that over the years, as many of us said they would, because that's the nature of power.
[02:30:29.615 --> 02:30:33.138]  Power continually corrupts the use and application of that power.
[02:30:33.678 --> 02:30:41.583]  But here, the other big difference, what really drives them nuts about Infowars' independent financing model, is just that.
[02:30:42.123 --> 02:30:44.725]  It's not that it's natural health supplements so much.
[02:30:44.765 --> 02:30:49.988]  It's not that it's not big corporate America and it's not big pharma and it's not any of that.
[02:30:50.368 --> 02:30:52.929]  It's that it's not a controlled narrative.
[02:30:52.989 --> 02:30:56.892]  It's not a censored messenger, a censored sponsor.
[02:30:57.412 --> 02:31:12.395]  That if you're taking money from anybody else, some big sugar daddy donor, some big corporate America advertiser, some big pharma solicitor, then you cannot be open, honest, and uncensored at what you believe and what you think and what you say.
[02:31:12.856 --> 02:31:21.165]  You're going to self-censor and consequently you're not going to meaningfully communicate content information that people want.
[02:31:21.546 --> 02:31:23.047]  This happens in the law all the time.
[02:31:23.408 --> 02:31:34.040]  An ordinary person will often hear a lawyer say something about a court, a judicial process, a government officer or prosecutor that they will be scared to say in public and on the press because they fear...
[02:31:34.580 --> 02:31:37.242]  Blowback from those within positions of power.
[02:31:37.642 --> 02:31:40.685]  The same is true of those who are controlled by a donor.
[02:31:40.885 --> 02:31:41.705]  I'll give an example.
[02:31:42.066 --> 02:31:43.547]  Black Rifle Coffee Company.
[02:31:43.867 --> 02:31:56.176]  There's a lot of people that will continue to hawk Black Rifle Coffee Company even though it's a company that threw Kyle Rittenhouse under the bus at a critical juncture while they were trying to be woke for the New York Times.
[02:31:56.536 --> 02:32:05.358]  They're not a company that deserves support, and yet you'll see them on big mainstream media, conservative mainstream media, being promoted and propagandized as such.
[02:32:05.778 --> 02:32:06.038]  Why?
[02:32:06.118 --> 02:32:17.561]  Because those people have to pimp themselves out for their advertisers because they refuse to create independent products of independent value that allows an independent narrative to be communicated to the world.
[02:32:18.021 --> 02:32:22.063]  That's what really drives them crazy about the InfoWars model.
[02:32:22.203 --> 02:32:26.546]  It is a purely populist model from top to bottom.
[02:32:26.966 --> 02:32:32.609]  It is a model that empowers the messenger and thereby empowers the audience.
[02:32:32.890 --> 02:32:41.975]  But it does so by empowering them in the process of the products it creates and the products it sells and the products it's able to produce for its audience.
[02:32:42.435 --> 02:32:49.780]  And of course, if the product didn't work, if people didn't like it, if it didn't meet their standards, that product would be gone.
[02:32:50.100 --> 02:32:53.863]  Because nobody's buying something that doesn't work and isn't effective and isn't what they want.
[02:32:54.323 --> 02:32:56.464]  And so that becomes an ultimate check.
[02:32:56.865 --> 02:33:03.489]  Basically, the audience becomes the only one to govern what content is created and is available on InfoWars.
[02:33:03.809 --> 02:33:11.955]  By choosing to support it at InfoWarsStore.com, by continuing to buy the products they like, and if they don't like the product, they let InfoWars know.
[02:33:12.635 --> 02:33:14.836]  By not buying it, or saying so in the reviews.
[02:33:15.436 --> 02:33:16.156]  And that's the process.
[02:33:16.436 --> 02:33:18.437]  It's a purely populist process.
[02:33:18.477 --> 02:33:20.137]  It's a deep American process.
[02:33:20.457 --> 02:33:23.798]  It's probably the most populist press structure in the history of America.
[02:33:24.158 --> 02:33:25.419]  Arguably the history of the world.
[02:33:25.719 --> 02:33:27.339]  Because who has the power base?
[02:33:27.379 --> 02:33:28.259]  What is populism?
[02:33:28.639 --> 02:33:30.560]  It's giving power to the people.
[02:33:30.920 --> 02:33:37.982]  As Abraham Lincoln said, we are supposed to be a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.
[02:33:38.382 --> 02:33:46.386]  What InfoWars has done is made an entire media network of the people, by the people, and for the people.
[02:33:46.707 --> 02:33:49.188]  You govern it at every single level.
[02:33:49.548 --> 02:33:52.009]  You govern it and its ability to put on content.
[02:33:52.290 --> 02:33:57.612]  You govern it on the quality of the products it creates and whether it meets up to your measurements and expectations.
[02:33:57.953 --> 02:34:07.558]  You govern its ability to communicate to the globe the independent information often either only available here or definitely first available here.
[02:34:08.158 --> 02:34:10.499]  After all, let's go back to the COVID lockdowns.
[02:34:10.879 --> 02:34:27.663]  Who was the first person talking about Bill Gates, talking about Bill Gates in the context of public health policy, talking about Bill Gates in the context of what may be coming with COVID-19, all the way back in January and early February of 2020?
[02:34:28.963 --> 02:34:33.844]  In fact, at the time, I remember people saying, oh, all this criticism of Bill Gates doesn't make any sense.
[02:34:33.864 --> 02:34:53.488]  This is a wonderful philanthropist, a man who just loves to give to the world, ignoring the fact that I remember when he was one of the most hated people in all of corporate America and all of ordinary America and all of tech America because of his scheming and monopolistic tactics and illicit behaviors while at Microsoft.
[02:34:53.508 --> 02:34:58.009]  There's a reason why he got not one, but two and maybe even three pies in the face.
[02:34:59.089 --> 02:35:12.580]  I remember the Bill Gates and Bill Gates' father and Bill Gates' grandfather who were involved in the eugenics movement and other organizations like Planned Parenthood who promoted and propagated the eugenics movement from its inception.
[02:35:12.940 --> 02:35:19.625]  An idea that we should control the population so only a small privileged group of people can have a disparate amount of resources.
[02:35:19.905 --> 02:35:21.927]  That, in the end, is what eugenics became.
[02:35:22.487 --> 02:35:24.368]  And I knew that was part of Bill Gates' agenda.
[02:35:24.388 --> 02:35:31.833]  But the only person talking about it with any degree of substantial scale of an audience was, once again, InfoWars.
[02:35:32.253 --> 02:35:32.914]  And why is that?
[02:35:33.094 --> 02:35:35.676]  Because InfoWars isn't dependent upon Big Pharma.
[02:35:35.976 --> 02:35:38.638]  Because InfoWars isn't dependent on corporate advertisers.
[02:35:38.678 --> 02:35:40.659]  Because InfoWars ain't dependent on a sugar daddy.
[02:35:41.079 --> 02:35:43.141]  InfoWars is only dependent on you.
[02:35:43.642 --> 02:35:44.723]  You are the front line.
[02:35:44.983 --> 02:35:46.324]  Continue to hold the line.
[02:35:46.665 --> 02:36:00.499]  Make yourself healthier, wealthier, and wiser by supporting InfoWars today, which you can do at InfoWarsStore.com, and make sure that a media of the people, by the people, continues to be for the people.
[02:36:01.601 --> 02:36:03.302]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:36:03.342 --> 02:36:05.082]  This is Robert Barnes guest hosting.
[02:36:05.662 --> 02:36:14.465]  Later up we're going to be discussing more vaccine deaths coming to celebrities and stars and sports players around the globe.
[02:36:15.265 --> 02:36:25.209]  But next, Shakira finds herself facing potential years in prison over alleged tax fraud in the case pending apparently in Spain.
[02:36:26.149 --> 02:36:31.831]  Tax cases have often been utilized to target political dissidents and other outsiders.
[02:36:32.331 --> 02:36:36.512]  Indeed, most countries in the world no longer imprison people for tax issues.
[02:36:37.052 --> 02:36:40.013]  In America, we have two major restraints on tax charges.
[02:36:40.413 --> 02:36:46.235]  Those are the good faith defense and the reliance defense that are unique to criminal tax law in general.
[02:36:46.755 --> 02:36:47.576]  Why do we have this?
[02:36:47.636 --> 02:36:51.337]  Well, because we don't want people sent to prison for simply owing a debt.
[02:36:51.917 --> 02:36:55.519]  Nor do we want people sent to prison for simple disagreement with the government.
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:06.346]  So as long as you have, in fact, a legitimate belief that what you were doing was lawful, a good faith belief, then you can be found not guilty even if your belief may have been incorrect.
[02:37:06.827 --> 02:37:10.569]  Even if they think your belief, the IRS and the courts, think your belief is crazy.
[02:37:10.949 --> 02:37:11.670]  That doesn't matter.
[02:37:11.710 --> 02:37:13.491]  All that matters is that you sincerely believe it.
[02:37:13.991 --> 02:37:20.340]  Also, a reliance defense, which is a defense by advice with attorneys, accountants, or other professionals.
[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:26.348]  And consequently, that's another grounds by which you can justifiably get acquitted of any tax charge.
[02:37:26.768 --> 02:37:29.452]  Because again, we don't want disagreement about the law.
[02:37:30.526 --> 02:37:33.910]  To be the grounds for imprisonment in America, generally.
[02:37:34.150 --> 02:37:35.411]  Unless, of course, you're Steve Bannon.
[02:37:35.872 --> 02:37:43.740]  And then we carve out an exception, much as the Travis County, Texas court is carving out an exception in the defamation cases proceeding with him.
[02:37:44.020 --> 02:37:50.446]  Indeed, there was an article today in the Texas Monthly that suggested that Alex Jones had foregone a First Amendment defense.
[02:37:50.987 --> 02:37:52.448]  That's completely and utterly false.
[02:37:52.968 --> 02:38:01.174]  This is another journalist who cannot take the time to actually read the cases and read what the Texas Court of Appeals said in this case.
[02:38:01.614 --> 02:38:20.066]  What the Texas Court of Appeals said to give people a full understanding of what's happening here, aside from the due process violations, privacy violations, jury trial right violations, right to confront accusers, all of that, the other violations that are occurring here go to the core of First Amendment protection.
[02:38:20.586 --> 02:38:22.046]  The theory is this.
[02:38:22.446 --> 02:38:27.227]  Let's say you articulate an idea that is different than what the government believes.
[02:38:27.267 --> 02:38:28.587]  The government calls it false.
[02:38:29.148 --> 02:38:31.148]  You can now be accused of misinformation.
[02:38:31.328 --> 02:38:34.548]  Whether or not it is in fact misinformation is secondary.
[02:38:34.789 --> 02:38:37.929]  All that matters is you said something the government doesn't agree with.
[02:38:38.149 --> 02:38:38.789]  That's part one.
[02:38:39.409 --> 02:38:39.949]  Part two.
[02:38:40.409 --> 02:38:46.731]  You persuade any group of people out there that your questions are legitimate questions.
[02:38:46.951 --> 02:38:48.231]  And they have questions as well.
[02:38:49.051 --> 02:38:49.572]  Part 3.
[02:38:50.072 --> 02:39:03.207]  Somebody who feels upset or offended by your viewpoints, emotionally distressed or anguished by your viewpoints, can now sue you based on however many people ever heard your ideas in the first place and believe them now.
[02:39:04.048 --> 02:39:05.169]  That is the core of the case.
[02:39:05.309 --> 02:39:10.513]  It doesn't require you to say a specifically false fact about a specific person.
[02:39:10.893 --> 02:39:15.137]  It doesn't even require you to identify anybody at all by name.
[02:39:15.677 --> 02:39:29.688]  What the Texas Court of Appeals said was that if someone could look them up on the internet and possibly find them, then the statement concerns them merely because it concerns a topic that they have an interest in.
[02:39:29.708 --> 02:39:32.771]  That's how extraordinary and extreme this was.
[02:39:33.431 --> 02:39:42.994]  Indeed, of all the people that purportedly believe certain things about Sandy Hook, how many of those people even knew the names of any of the people that are now suing Alex Jones?
[02:39:43.154 --> 02:39:45.614]  Because Alex Jones isn't the one who ever called him by name, ever!
[02:39:46.315 --> 02:39:50.556]  So, what that's the important... The First Amendment has been at the forefront of this case.
[02:39:50.916 --> 02:39:52.616]  It has been litigated repeatedly.
[02:39:52.696 --> 02:39:54.137]  It is preserved in the record.
[02:39:54.657 --> 02:40:01.141]  These are journalists trying to pretend that what's happening to Alex Jones couldn't possibly happen to them.
[02:40:01.701 --> 02:40:11.987]  And what they're really relying upon is political power brokers being the gatekeepers, being on their side, so that it doesn't matter, so that it won't ever happen to them.
[02:40:12.307 --> 02:40:24.810]  They're really relying upon the corruption of our legal process to protect them, not the rule of law to protect them, because the rule of law is what the corrupt political processes are busy changing.
[02:40:25.230 --> 02:40:34.812]  Busy changing, so you say something a whole bunch of people disagree with, those people who disagree with it, note that the government also disagrees with you, they can sue you into bankruptcy and oblivion.
[02:40:35.572 --> 02:40:41.476]  That's the theory and premise, and that was fully litigated before any of the default issues even came up in the case.
[02:40:41.836 --> 02:40:48.241]  So the First Amendment is still fundamental and essential to the case of Alex Jones, and will continue to be.
[02:40:48.641 --> 02:41:16.838]   And journalists who pretend he somehow isn't raising that, and that somehow isn't part of it, are lying to themselves, trying to say, this can't happen to me, don't worry, this can't happen to me, patting themselves on the back, hugging themselves, foolishly, because yes, It can happen to you and it will happen to you if you are a dissident source of information, if you are a heretic out there communicating heretical information that questions and challenges the government's narrative on any set of topics.
[02:41:17.138 --> 02:41:21.641]  So all of them should be alert and awake and quit fooling themselves in that process.
[02:41:22.421 --> 02:41:27.423]  In other news, the extraordinary ability of the Biden administration to play Humpty Dumpty continues.
[02:41:27.964 --> 02:41:31.245]  As Humpty Dumpty said, a word is what I say it is.
[02:41:31.785 --> 02:42:01.341]   And that is how a drug that's a therapeutic, that's actually a gene therapy, suddenly, magically, miraculously gets called a vaccine, even though it doesn't inoculate you from the disease, even though it isn't in fact safe, even though it isn't in fact effective, even though it in fact doesn't prevent transmission, Even though increasingly more places are reporting that the vaccinated are reporting higher rates of hospitalization, higher rates of COVID, higher rates of death, higher rates of serious disability than the unvaccinated.
[02:42:01.962 --> 02:42:15.230]  Much in the same way, when it came out that there had been two quarters of economic decline in GDP, the GDP turned negative in the first quarter of 2022 and then stayed negative in the second quarter of 2022.
[02:42:16.451 --> 02:42:25.935]  Historically, universally, even William Jefferson Clinton, who had difficulty remembering what it is, admitted that that is a recession back in 2000.
[02:42:26.615 --> 02:42:29.537]  Well, now the Biden administration says, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:42:29.837 --> 02:42:31.677]  That's not what recession means.
[02:42:32.118 --> 02:42:37.158]   Recession means what I say it is, which apparently is no longer what a recession means.
[02:42:37.158 --> 02:42:42.298]   As we face these 1970s-style economics, I continue to recommend George Gammon and other
[02:42:42.298 --> 02:42:48.377]   sources that will be daily providing information to you on the economic fallout and ramifications.
[02:42:48.377 --> 02:42:53.478]   But look to the 1970s as probably the closest historical parallel to what we're facing,
[02:42:53.478 --> 02:43:01.278]   to constant stagflation, economic decline, economic stagnation with high inflation, that
[02:43:01.278 --> 02:43:05.717]   those two are likely to continue to be parallel as we move forward.
[02:43:05.717 --> 02:43:12.877]   And in the hypocritical day of the week message, we have the District of Columbia mayor, the
[02:43:12.877 --> 02:43:18.078]   same District of Columbia mayor who refused to allow the National Guard to be present
[02:43:18.078 --> 02:43:21.597]  or anyone else on January 6th, the same D.C.
[02:43:21.665 --> 02:43:41.112]   Mayor that was culpable for the extraordinary lack of, an unusual lack of security present that day, necessary to facilitate the events on January 6th, for them to even occur in the first instance, Now says she wants the National Guard out because illegal immigrants are coming to D.C.
[02:43:41.612 --> 02:43:57.257]  So it turns out the District of Columbia only wants enough illegal immigrants to be able to give them some Ethiopian food and serve them some exotic foods and help drive some Ubers and drive some taxis and be able to be available to serve some maid service.
[02:43:57.537 --> 02:44:01.819]  They don't want actual waves of illegal immigrants coming into their community.
[02:44:02.239 --> 02:44:04.201]  In the way the people in D.C.
[02:44:04.502 --> 02:44:10.248]  have brought about illegal immigration in massive waves in states like Texas and Arizona.
[02:44:10.809 --> 02:44:13.993]  And what are some of the complaints that she and the mayor of New York are making?
[02:44:14.333 --> 02:44:18.013]   They're the complaints conservatives have made for a long time, which is if you're going
[02:44:18.013 --> 02:44:20.672]  to have this level of immigration, at least make it legal.
[02:44:20.672 --> 02:44:23.092]  If it's not legal, it shouldn't be allowed.
[02:44:23.092 --> 02:44:25.132]  Number one, respect for the rule of law.
[02:44:25.132 --> 02:44:29.733]   Number two, why should working class communities on the border in Texas and then throughout
[02:44:29.733 --> 02:44:33.813]   the South and Midwest, because that's where it's been disproportionately impacted, it's
[02:44:33.813 --> 02:44:36.933]  working class folks who see their wages decline.
[02:44:36.933 --> 02:44:41.933]   It's working class folks who have their school system effectively put under pressure because
[02:44:41.933 --> 02:44:46.093]   of increasing student participation from those who haven't paid taxes in the first instance.
[02:44:46.093 --> 02:44:50.012]   It's their roads under pressure, their buildings under pressure, their political infrastructure
[02:44:50.012 --> 02:44:53.173]   under pressure, their criminal justice system under pressure.
[02:44:53.173 --> 02:44:54.772]  They've been bearing all the burden.
[02:44:55.228 --> 02:44:56.309]  And getting none of the benefit.
[02:44:56.769 --> 02:45:12.796]  And now that the District of Columbia has to get some of the burden for all the benefit they've been getting over the years, including their ties and connections to companies getting rich and getting fat off of illegal immigration, including people connected to illicit activities and enterprises doing the same, because D.C.
[02:45:12.856 --> 02:45:23.641]  is the capital of such activities in this country, sadly and unfortunately, due to the power-mad nature of the people who occupy positions of power there, they're finally having to pay the price and their hypocrisy is getting exposed.
[02:45:24.221 --> 02:45:41.613]  When we come back after the break, vaccine deaths continue to skyrocket at an extraordinary rate, including hitting so many sports stars, so many celebrities, so many public personalities, so many people that everybody knows that they can't hide and run from it anymore.
[02:45:42.174 --> 02:45:45.116]  Talk about those vaccine deaths when we come back after the break.
[02:45:48.915 --> 02:45:52.818]  Ladies and gentlemen, humanity is at a historic crossroads.
[02:45:52.878 --> 02:46:00.022]  The information that InfoWars is covering is literally the blueprint to counter their great reset with the Great Awakening.
[02:46:00.823 --> 02:46:04.986]  When you support InfoWars by getting great products, you keep the tip of the spear on the air.
[02:46:05.386 --> 02:46:17.754]  You see the enemy hates us probably more than even Trump because we are identifying who they are and what incredible psychotic control freaks they are and how humanity can be awakened to defeat them.
[02:46:18.554 --> 02:46:26.718]  Right now, we're doing a major fundraiser to fund our legal bills and to fund things into the future and to make sure we get stronger, not weaker.
[02:46:27.718 --> 02:46:28.859]  But you are our strength.
[02:46:28.959 --> 02:46:30.019]  We are our strength together.
[02:46:30.319 --> 02:46:37.863]  Now, right now, we're running a huge sale and a lot of great products that have been sold out for a long time, thank God, have finally come in right on time.
[02:46:37.883 --> 02:46:38.583]  The cavalry's here.
[02:46:39.043 --> 02:46:41.965]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is our number one total bestseller.
[02:46:42.585 --> 02:46:44.146]  It just came back in two days ago.
[02:46:45.046 --> 02:46:46.908]  It's discounted at InfoWarsTour.com.

[02:46:53.554 --> 02:46:54.595]  Highest level of humanoid.
[02:46:54.976 --> 02:46:58.859]  So incredible for inflammation, for your immune system, for everything.
[02:46:58.899 --> 02:47:00.721]  But inflammation is such a key thing.
[02:47:00.761 --> 02:47:01.542]  It's amazing for that.
[02:47:02.042 --> 02:47:02.743]  Diet force.
[02:47:02.823 --> 02:47:03.544]  Look, I'm overweight.

[02:47:43.254 --> 02:47:45.096]  We're all doing it together, so God bless.
[02:47:45.116 --> 02:47:45.816]  Please take action.
[02:47:49.219 --> 02:47:50.940]  Welcome back to Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:50.980 --> 02:47:52.902]  This is Robert Barnes guest hosting.
[02:47:53.777 --> 02:48:07.386]  Up in a bit, we're going to be discussing the vaccine side effects and the accumulating deaths we keep witnessing around the globe from high power and high profile individuals that continue to point to the vaccine as the culprit.
[02:48:07.826 --> 02:48:13.530]  In parts of Canada, they have unexplained deaths leading the death charts in various provinces.
[02:48:13.850 --> 02:48:16.652]  The same thing is happening in various parts around the world.
[02:48:17.111 --> 02:48:20.751]   And we're seeing it and witnessing it in live time, not only with sports stars collapsing
[02:48:20.751 --> 02:48:26.511]   live, but other stars and celebrities who've had it happen to them recently as well.
[02:48:26.511 --> 02:48:32.731]   But before that, just in case you're unaware, it turns out that famine can be good for you.
[02:48:32.731 --> 02:48:38.591]   That may seem strange, it may seem like a Klaus Schwab, Z-what-like, Z-crickets kind
[02:48:38.591 --> 02:48:42.790]  of statement, but that is according to the United Nations.
[02:48:42.790 --> 02:48:48.191]   In a United States political science professor who's writing about the benefits of world
[02:48:48.989 --> 02:48:51.211]  That's right, the benefits of world hunger.
[02:48:51.271 --> 02:48:55.796]  Just in case you didn't know, you can look up the article itself referenced on Zero Hedge and others.
[02:48:56.237 --> 02:48:57.979]  That by the way, those in the Alex Jones...
[02:48:58.539 --> 02:49:02.262]  Sandy Hook Trial want to tell you, you should never ever go to Zero Head.
[02:49:02.302 --> 02:49:02.762]  CNN!
[02:49:03.122 --> 02:49:05.884]  That's the fountain of reliable information and truth.
[02:49:06.204 --> 02:49:08.566]  They never spread any conspiracies there at CNN.
[02:49:08.986 --> 02:49:10.888]  Like rushing eight for four years, for example.
[02:49:11.388 --> 02:49:14.170]  But listen to just one of the quotes.
[02:49:14.971 --> 02:49:17.973]  Hunger has great positive value to many people.
[02:49:18.593 --> 02:49:22.296]  Indeed, it is fundamental to the working of the world's economy.
[02:49:23.016 --> 02:49:25.638]  Hungry people are the most productive people.
[02:49:26.138 --> 02:49:28.360]  Especially when there's a need for manual labor.
[02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:33.163]  So basically you can create a bunch of cheap labor slaves by starving them.
[02:49:33.823 --> 02:49:34.763]  Isn't that wonderful?
[02:49:34.824 --> 02:49:39.687]  The United Nations always looking out for the poor and the little folks, as they always do.
[02:49:40.487 --> 02:49:46.789]  In the same vein we have in Germany with their complete backfiring disaster and debacle of a policy in Ukraine.
[02:49:47.429 --> 02:50:13.223]   Already governments have collapsed or on the verge of collapse in Estonia, Bulgaria, Italy, in the United Kingdom, partially in France with the parliamentary elections turning against Macron, One of the great benefits of that was the populist on the left and the populist on the right with Le Pen and Mélenchon getting together and actually working together to oppose COVID vaccine passports throughout the various French territories.
[02:50:13.563 --> 02:50:21.529]  Very positive sign to see some aspects of the populist left and right working together finally, especially in France where that is so difficult to achieve.
[02:50:22.069 --> 02:50:27.872]  You can glimpse it in looking at the interview between Glenn Greenwald and Alex Jones from last week's premiere.
[02:50:28.212 --> 02:50:35.777]  Again, Alex's War is now fully out and available in theaters across the country, available on a range of streaming platforms.
[02:50:36.057 --> 02:50:47.323]  You can also buy it right here, get the old-fashioned DVD, so that you don't have to worry about it disappearing from your digital library, as Amazon has been... had a propense... tendency to do.
[02:50:48.083 --> 02:50:50.825]  You can do that at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[02:50:51.926 --> 02:50:54.848]  But what is happening in the ongoing Ukraine disaster?
[02:50:55.388 --> 02:50:56.589]  Well, here's a nice headline.
[02:50:57.010 --> 02:51:00.473]  German cities turn off hot water and cut lighting.
[02:51:02.003 --> 02:51:06.385]  So, you're going to get used to a lot of cold showers, low warming abilities.
[02:51:06.745 --> 02:51:09.266]  One of the things they said was, don't worry, the Germans will build wood.
[02:51:09.366 --> 02:51:13.808]  Well, you know, they'll use wood to take care of their problem as winter approaches.
[02:51:14.308 --> 02:51:22.772]  Unfortunately, most German buildings, for climate change purposes, have retrofitted themselves so they don't allow their fireplaces to work.
[02:51:23.072 --> 02:51:24.593]  So that doesn't function either.
[02:51:25.553 --> 02:51:34.995]  And in an effort to understand why it's important to always fight back and the value of fighting back is what we're seeing and witnessing in these vaccine side effects.
[02:51:35.015 --> 02:51:41.177]  That getting out independent information about risk is what kept a lot of people from unnecessarily taking this drug.
[02:51:41.657 --> 02:51:54.182]   I have filed suit on behalf of Children's Health Defense against the Food and Drug Administration With Robert Kennedy challenging their authorization and marketing of the vaccine, particularly to children, but also to the military.
[02:51:54.302 --> 02:51:57.224]  One case is pending before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.
[02:51:57.283 --> 02:52:02.163]   another is pending in Waco, Texas, here in the Western District of Texas, because they
[02:52:02.163 --> 02:52:07.324]   have so repeatedly lied using Big Bird and Elmo to convince people something is safe,
[02:52:07.324 --> 02:52:13.763]   effective vaccine that is in fact an experimental drug using gene therapy that does not inoculate
[02:52:13.763 --> 02:52:18.283]   you against getting the disease, does not inoculate you against transmitting the disease,
[02:52:18.283 --> 02:52:22.603]   and is not in fact the definition of a vaccine, nor is it safe or effective under their own
[02:52:22.603 --> 02:52:24.663]  literature and available data.
[02:52:24.663 --> 02:52:29.323]   That is as supported by Brooke Jackson's case brought against Pfizer, pending over in another
[02:52:29.323 --> 02:52:33.083]  part of the federal courts in Texas and Beaumont.
[02:52:33.083 --> 02:52:36.804]   But in this context, just take a look, just go through any of your headlines and find
[02:52:36.804 --> 02:52:38.283]  the people that are just suddenly dying.
[02:52:38.714 --> 02:52:41.838]  They're even calling it SADS, which is sad.
[02:52:42.258 --> 02:52:44.040]  That, you know, sudden adult death syndrome.
[02:52:44.120 --> 02:52:45.222]  Don't know where this is coming from.
[02:52:45.262 --> 02:52:48.686]  People, you know, they get the vaccine, they get the shot, they get a booster, boom, they're dead.
[02:52:49.066 --> 02:52:50.468]  I don't know what could possibly be the cause.
[02:52:50.868 --> 02:53:02.630]  Yeah, we're getting person after person after person, a great Colombian, Latin American singer, prominent sports players, prominent celebrities around the globe that this has happened to.
[02:53:02.991 --> 02:53:10.032]  This shows a continued warning sign that the government has not been honest, not been forthcoming about the real scope of adverse events.
[02:53:10.392 --> 02:53:14.513]  As Obama himself admitted, this was a mass experiment on billions of people.
[02:53:14.893 --> 02:53:25.726]  And we're starting to see the consequences already as being far more devastating and dangerous to the health, especially of young people, than COVID could be, especially the Omicron version of it.
[02:53:26.347 --> 02:53:42.582]   But, to give you sort of a white pill as we exit tonight, It is important to remember why it matters that you continue to not only participate and support InfoWars, but participate in the Court of Public Opinion, to continue to be involved at whatever level that you can be or choose to be.
[02:53:43.163 --> 02:53:51.490]  Because your ability to fight back in the Court of Public Opinion is the only reason why billions of people around the globe have not taken this dangerous drug.
[02:53:51.931 --> 02:53:57.816]   It's the only reason why your willingness and readiness to fight back Even L.A.
[02:53:57.916 --> 02:54:05.621]  County had to reverse its intentions to reimpose a mask mandate in the County of Los Angeles.
[02:54:06.021 --> 02:54:07.342]  They were eager to do so.
[02:54:07.422 --> 02:54:08.863]  They were anxious to do so.
[02:54:08.923 --> 02:54:10.804]  They declared their intention to do so.
[02:54:11.225 --> 02:54:17.329]  But then ordinary people in the court of public opinion spoke out and spoke back against it.
[02:54:17.729 --> 02:54:18.429]  And what happened?
[02:54:18.610 --> 02:54:19.610]  Well, here's the headline.
[02:54:20.171 --> 02:54:20.351]  L.A.
[02:54:20.411 --> 02:54:26.195]  County Public Health Director Ferrer won't mandate masks now.
[02:54:26.815 --> 02:54:30.377]  So that's only because you chose to fight back.
[02:54:30.718 --> 02:54:32.078]  You chose to push back.
[02:54:32.419 --> 02:54:36.802]  So part of it is being self-educated, and self-educated is a function of self-empowerment.
[02:54:37.202 --> 02:54:51.151]  Part of it is supporting those content creators and independent media providers that provide you access to that information in the first place, and also the ability to share it with others to be able to get it and influence the court of public opinion.
[02:54:51.571 --> 02:55:02.962]  And then ultimately sharing your opinion that is now informed and well-educated with the public and engaging the public in dialogue, discussion, and debate to try to influence the shape and direction of it.
[02:55:03.363 --> 02:55:06.646]  Without InfoWars, there never is a President Donald John Trump.
[02:55:06.986 --> 02:55:09.769]  Without InfoWars, there's no pushback against lockdowns.
[02:55:10.129 --> 02:55:13.691]  Without InfoWars, there's no pushback on them shutting down our schools.
[02:55:14.052 --> 02:55:17.154]  Without InfoWars, there's no pushback on mask mandates.
[02:55:17.554 --> 02:55:20.876]  Without InfoWars, there's no pushback against election corruption.
[02:55:21.257 --> 02:55:24.799]  Without InfoWars, there's no pushback against the war propagandists.
[02:55:25.119 --> 02:55:36.287]  Look at all the war whores and how they all united for pushing this completely bogus war in Ukraine that was built on lie after lie after lie, libel after libel after libel.
[02:55:36.667 --> 02:55:47.920]  When the New York Times gets caught libeling and killing millions of people around the globe once again in another global war conflict that didn't need to happen but for their lives, they're never held accountable.
[02:55:48.300 --> 02:55:57.351]  They are coming after InfoWars because InfoWars is at the tip of the spear in stopping and preventing and precluding and exposing deep state bad actions and conduct.
[02:55:57.691 --> 02:56:10.210]  So continue to support InfoWars, continue to be the front of the line, hold the line, and together we will make sure independent information continues to get out there to be shared with you because you are part of the changing the world.
[02:56:10.470 --> 02:56:13.430]  You are part of making the world a better place.
[02:56:13.430 --> 02:56:24.430]  [Music]
[02:56:24.430 --> 02:56:32.430]   My fellow Americans, my fellow humans, history has reached an incredible crossroads.
[02:56:33.221 --> 02:56:37.143]  We are now deciding the very future destiny of our species.
[02:56:37.383 --> 02:56:41.765]  And at the very forefront of that fight against the New World Order and their Great Reset is InfoWars.
[02:56:41.945 --> 02:56:50.310]  And it's you, the viewer and listener of this broadcast, that have paved the way for a real opposition to the New World Order that has a very good chance of defeating them.
[02:56:50.870 --> 02:56:52.531]  Even their own internal documents have leaked.
[02:56:53.070 --> 02:56:58.750]   where the top globalists admit they're losing their war for the world and their war to take
[02:56:58.750 --> 02:57:03.790]   over humanity. But still things are neck and neck and things are very very close. Ladies and
[02:57:03.790 --> 02:57:07.710]   gentlemen you've done an incredible job spreading the word about InfoWars, the broadcast, the articles,
[02:57:07.710 --> 02:57:13.230]   the videos, the special guests we have, our other great hosts. You've done an amazing job praying for us.
[02:57:13.423 --> 02:57:19.349]  You've done an incredible job buying the products and financially supporting us so we can support you in this critical fight.
[02:57:19.690 --> 02:57:27.458]  That's why I'm asking every viewer and every listener to understand we have reached the most critical point in our battle against the globalists in our 28-year history.
[02:57:28.539 --> 02:57:32.541]  We have major plans in development and major operations that are very close to being launched.
[02:57:32.881 --> 02:57:40.285]  We have so many projects that are not known to the enemy that we've been secretly financing and just a lot of exciting things that have been going on.
[02:57:40.825 --> 02:57:43.006]  We only deliver with our information.
[02:57:43.046 --> 02:57:47.805]   We only deliver with real results against the New World Order, but we cannot do it without
[02:57:47.805 --> 02:57:48.805]  your support.
