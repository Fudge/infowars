[00:00.000 --> 00:06.560]  The elite's minions within the inept court system are bungling the best laid plans of
[00:06.560 --> 00:08.840]  the perverse and crooked establishment.
[00:08.840 --> 00:14.280]  And so it goes, amongst the New York elite who are now in yet another panic after a list
[00:14.280 --> 00:21.360]  of alleged clients of the student prostitute in the Sarah Lawrence sex cult case was inadvertently
[00:21.360 --> 00:23.080]  published online.
[00:23.080 --> 00:28.800]  We're back covering the shocking allegations against Lawrence Ray, a 60-year-old dad accused
[00:28.800 --> 00:34.400]  of starting a sex cult with his daughter's college classmates after getting out of prison.
[00:34.400 --> 00:39.360]  He's now facing claims that he's objected his alleged victims to sexual and psychological
[00:39.360 --> 00:42.720]  manipulation and physical abuse.
[00:42.720 --> 00:47.200]  But long before the sex cult accusations came to light, Lawrence was a well-connected
[00:47.200 --> 00:51.320]  road traveler whose friends included former New York City police commissioner Bernie
[00:51.320 --> 00:54.040]  Carrick, who joins us now.
[00:54.040 --> 01:02.440]  To give you an idea, Doc, of the spectrum of people that he was around, he called me
[01:02.440 --> 01:06.520]  up from an airplane one time and he said, pick me up at JFK.
[01:06.520 --> 01:07.520]  I'm coming into JFK.
[01:07.520 --> 01:09.600]  I've got some friends.
[01:09.600 --> 01:15.440]  And as he got off the plane and he was walking toward my car, I'm looking out the window
[01:15.440 --> 01:20.840]  and I said, wow, I said, this guy that he's walking with, he really looks like President
[01:20.840 --> 01:24.360]  Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
[01:24.360 --> 01:28.640]  And he puts Mikhail Gorbachev in the backseat of my car.
[01:28.640 --> 01:32.920]  Another time he picks up the phone in my car, he calls the commandant of the United States
[01:32.920 --> 01:36.120]  Marine Corps, General James Jones.
[01:36.120 --> 01:43.120]  Another time he invites me to a private dinner and I walk in and it's him, Governor Mario
[01:43.120 --> 01:48.280]  Cuomo and Senator Robert Torselli of New Jersey.
[01:48.280 --> 01:51.800]  But as quickly as the list was under seal, it was released.
[01:51.800 --> 01:55.080]  A mad attempt to undo the damage was ongoing.
[01:55.080 --> 02:00.640]  But unfortunately for them, the Daily Mail acquired a copy of the 121 names that only
[02:00.640 --> 02:02.640]  scraped the surface.
[02:02.640 --> 02:07.400]  According to the Daily Mail, the now released document is an exhibit admitted in the federal
[02:07.400 --> 02:14.080]  case against 62-year-old Larry Ray, who is charged with operating a sex cult out of his
[02:14.080 --> 02:17.880]  daughter's dorm room at Sarah Lawrence College.
[02:17.880 --> 02:22.440]  The years of allegations about unspeakable abuse against young people he met as college
[02:22.440 --> 02:28.160]  students, 60-year-old Lawrence Ray was arrested at this New Jersey home on Tuesday.
[02:28.160 --> 02:32.800]  One of his daughter's roommates and one of the female victims in the indictment were
[02:32.800 --> 02:34.640]  in the residence at the time.
[02:34.640 --> 02:39.840]  According to the indictment, Ray held so-called therapy sessions in his daughter's dorm,
[02:39.840 --> 02:44.160]  alienating several of the victims from their parents after earning their trust.
[02:44.160 --> 02:49.600]  The document says he controlled them by using verbal and physical abuse, which escalated
[02:49.600 --> 02:54.080]  after he and some of the victims later moved to New York City.
[02:54.080 --> 03:00.040]  The indictment also charges Ray with depriving his victims of food and sleep and taking explicit
[03:00.040 --> 03:02.000]  pictures of some of them.
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.360]  Prosecutors say he accused them of lying and stealing, and in response they say he asked
[03:07.360 --> 03:11.440]  for money, eventually extorting nearly a million dollars.
[03:11.440 --> 03:16.560]  Ray directed his victims to obtain money for him by other means, by draining their parents'
[03:16.560 --> 03:21.320]  savings and worse, forced labor and prostitution.
[03:21.320 --> 03:27.000]  Ray is also accused of demanding taped confessions from his victims, for supposed crimes they
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.500]  committed.
[03:30.500 --> 03:36.440]  In this video uploaded in 2017, an apparently disoriented young woman says she tried to
[03:36.440 --> 03:39.840]  poison Ray, an unsubstantiated allegation.
[03:39.840 --> 03:49.040]  Among the Johns on the list are a top executive at the Gap clothing firm and her husband.
[03:49.040 --> 03:52.080]  They were one of two married couples that were included.
[03:52.080 --> 03:56.680]  A former New York State Supreme Court judge is also named.
[03:56.680 --> 04:01.840]  Another alleged client is a painter who has studios in Manhattan's East Village and in
[04:01.840 --> 04:07.760]  Italy, a third and architect famous for designing colleges and university buildings, an investment
[04:07.760 --> 04:14.000]  executive who was also a pedophile in Jeffrey Epstein's infamous Little Black Book of Contacts.
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.080]  Other names include a hedge fund manager who has his name on a museum on a building in
[04:19.080 --> 04:24.440]  New York, a Washington, D.C. lobbyist, and an international diamond dealer.
[04:24.440 --> 04:29.880]  Also included is an executive at the Metropolitan Transit Authority, an account executive at
[04:29.880 --> 04:32.920]  Amazon, and a veteran travel writer.
[04:32.920 --> 04:39.080]  Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Keith Reneer, Allison Mack, Peter Nygaard, and now
[04:39.080 --> 04:40.400]  Larry Ray.
[04:40.400 --> 04:45.360]  They will all merely be replaced to supply the debauched elite with the flesh for their
[04:45.360 --> 04:47.000]  fantasy lifestyle.
[04:47.000 --> 04:52.480]  Meanwhile, they continue to pervert our own children with their demonic policies.
[04:52.480 --> 05:22.320]  This is John Bowne reporting.
[05:22.320 --> 05:27.520]  With Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform for thousands
[05:27.520 --> 05:33.120]  of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[05:33.120 --> 05:38.000]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.480]  Info wars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[05:42.480 --> 05:48.800]  movement worldwide, but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds
[05:48.800 --> 05:50.560]  and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[05:50.560 --> 05:54.880]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now, the mega emergency blowout
[05:54.880 --> 06:06.480]  sale up to 75% off, getting incredible products and keep info wars as strong as ever.
[06:06.480 --> 06:20.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday edition.
[06:20.160 --> 06:22.800]  When I say live, I want to show you he is live in the studio.
[06:22.800 --> 06:28.520]  I am taping this in the morning for my home before I go and get some more medical tests.
[06:28.520 --> 06:29.520]  I'm 48.
[06:29.520 --> 06:32.080]  I'm under a lot of stress.
[06:32.080 --> 06:40.100]  And Dr. Marble was in studio as a guest on other issues on Monday and saw some signs
[06:40.100 --> 06:41.600]  of some concerning things.
[06:41.600 --> 06:48.560]  Check me out with a stethoscope and blood pressure machine and said that he thought I should
[06:48.560 --> 06:50.800]  get checked out by a doctor.
[06:50.800 --> 06:54.960]  And so as soon as I could get into a clinic versus checking myself into the emergency
[06:54.960 --> 06:59.400]  room, it would have been Wednesday morning.
[06:59.400 --> 07:03.720]  And I think it would be a big deal by just having my lawyers contact them and say, hey,
[07:03.720 --> 07:05.320]  we probably need to move this deposition.
[07:05.320 --> 07:12.680]  They've moved depositions on us dates and times at least five times that we can document.
[07:12.680 --> 07:15.240]  And so it's really not that big a deal.
[07:15.240 --> 07:18.640]  I've already sat three times for depositions in the Sandy Hook case.
[07:18.640 --> 07:22.560]  We've given them over 300,000 pages of documents.
[07:22.560 --> 07:26.680]  They got all our financial records, everything for a defamation case.
[07:26.680 --> 07:30.520]  And so when you see my financials on the news, when you see all the depositions will be on
[07:30.520 --> 07:37.440]  the news and then you see that I've been defaulted, excuse me, when you see that I've been defaulted
[07:37.440 --> 07:40.960]  saying I gave them nothing, it's all a lie.
[07:40.960 --> 07:42.200]  These are show trials.
[07:42.200 --> 07:43.760]  These are staged events.
[07:43.760 --> 07:47.200]  But I intend to sit for the deposition, the fourth one.
[07:47.200 --> 07:54.400]  I intend to fight, even though I'm in a court case in Connecticut and Texas with three different
[07:54.400 --> 08:00.840]  cases, two in Texas, one in Connecticut, where I've been found guilty by the judges.
[08:00.840 --> 08:04.920]  Now every American, even if they have a low IQ nose, you're innocent until proven guilty
[08:04.920 --> 08:09.320]  and the judges don't find you guilty.
[08:09.320 --> 08:14.560]  Fault judgments are when somebody never shows up one time or never shows up a quarter, doesn't
[08:14.560 --> 08:19.640]  file papers or gets caught filing fraudulent documents.
[08:19.640 --> 08:23.520]  And even then you get sanctioned with lesser sanctions.
[08:23.520 --> 08:29.320]  We have been fed into the Democratic Party process by political judges.
[08:29.320 --> 08:31.120]  Take Travis County.
[08:31.120 --> 08:35.640]  They indicted Rick Perry years ago, the governor, when he vetoed a bill.
[08:35.640 --> 08:37.560]  That's in the state constitution.
[08:37.560 --> 08:42.240]  He's allowed to veto a bill and I'll go to the whole story about the county attorney
[08:42.240 --> 08:47.680]  got caught super drunk spitting and attacking police like a demon with a spit bag over her
[08:47.680 --> 08:48.680]  head.
[08:48.680 --> 08:53.000]  And she ran the Texas Anti-Corruption Commission that under state law is giving all this money.
[08:53.000 --> 09:00.200]  So Perry said, if you don't remove her, I'm going to veto the tens of millions of dollars
[09:00.200 --> 09:01.840]  that go to it.
[09:01.840 --> 09:02.840]  They wouldn't remove her.
[09:02.840 --> 09:03.840]  So he vetoed it.
[09:03.840 --> 09:04.840]  They indicted him.
[09:04.840 --> 09:06.120]  He had to spend $2 million in fears fighting it.
[09:06.120 --> 09:07.840]  You can go look up interviews where he talks about it.
[09:07.840 --> 09:10.880]  This is the same stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:10.880 --> 09:14.280]  They picked a few things I talked about years ago out of context.
[09:14.280 --> 09:16.800]  Made me the Sandy Hook man.
[09:16.800 --> 09:20.360]  And now when we go to court, literally the judges are primping with their mirrors and
[09:20.360 --> 09:27.640]  their makeup and they're miking them up and miking up the lawyers and the BBC and HBO
[09:27.640 --> 09:30.160]  and all the chain Netflix are there.
[09:30.160 --> 09:35.360]  And then they got up and say, he's getting rich off Sandy Hooks.
[09:35.360 --> 09:40.480]  He made his whole career off of it as the New York Times writer says, buy my book, buy
[09:40.480 --> 09:41.480]  my book.
[09:41.480 --> 09:45.280]  It just came out in time for the trial, buy my book.
[09:45.280 --> 09:48.040]  Everything they say about me is who they are.
[09:48.040 --> 09:51.880]  And the groups around Sandy Hook tragedy have brought in hundreds of millions of dollars
[09:51.880 --> 09:53.380]  of donations.
[09:53.380 --> 09:57.760]  Some of the people involved rake in up to a million a year themselves personally.
[09:57.760 --> 10:01.960]  And when we go to trial, all that's coming out one way or another.
[10:01.960 --> 10:05.800]  These judges that aren't judges think they can contain this and control all this.
[10:05.800 --> 10:13.160]  It's going to be their waterloo because America knows how corrupt and out of control the system
[10:13.160 --> 10:14.160]  is.
[10:14.160 --> 10:21.080]  So look, my health issues are my issues and they're private and they're protected by HIPAA.
[10:21.080 --> 10:27.680]  And I mean, you saw this judge up in Connecticut yesterday and you saw the lawyers, these Democrat
[10:27.680 --> 10:33.720]  party lawyers that worked for Blumenthal openly saying, we want him arrested and put
[10:33.720 --> 10:39.680]  in jail if he doesn't show up for some multi-day long, wait, Connecticut law works.
[10:39.680 --> 10:41.640]  It's just unlimited long deal.
[10:41.640 --> 10:44.720]  And so when I talked to these doctors, they said, you're crazy.
[10:44.720 --> 10:46.040]  You need to go home.
[10:46.040 --> 10:47.040]  You need to go get these tests.
[10:47.040 --> 10:49.640]  I got more tests set today, more tomorrow.
[10:49.640 --> 10:51.080]  And you need to stay away from the microphone.
[10:51.080 --> 10:56.720]  Well, here I am, even though I shouldn't be on here because I have to respond to the hundreds
[10:56.720 --> 11:03.720]  of news articles, including the Associated Press that are attacking me and saying I'm
[11:03.720 --> 11:04.720]  a horrible person.
[11:04.720 --> 11:07.920]  But I guess, I mean, I might just release my medical records, make you all look like
[11:07.920 --> 11:08.920]  fools.
[11:08.920 --> 11:12.760]  I mean, I've had EKGs, I've had scans, I've had it all.
[11:12.760 --> 11:18.360]  And I started getting sick after I got COVID last year, almost killed my dad.
[11:18.360 --> 11:19.520]  And I took care of them.
[11:19.520 --> 11:21.760]  And it was really bad Delta variant.
[11:21.760 --> 11:23.760]  And I got spike protein.
[11:23.760 --> 11:27.880]  And like everybody else, it attacked my cardiovascular system, OK?
[11:27.880 --> 11:35.200]  And so, again, somebody on death row is allowed to go get their medical treatment and hearings
[11:35.200 --> 11:37.280]  and things are postponed.
[11:37.280 --> 11:41.560]  But I'm treated worse than somebody on death row.
[11:41.560 --> 11:47.320]  And so we got all this huge rush of Ukraine news, we've got all this middle schools locking
[11:47.320 --> 11:51.120]  the doors with fences around them to march the kids around as captives of the whole
[11:51.120 --> 11:56.440]  leftist agenda, and then for weeks on end, everything is LGBT, sexual indoctrination.
[11:56.440 --> 12:02.560]  And we got serious stuff to be talking about here.
[12:02.560 --> 12:06.760]  And I'm literally, quite frankly, I was looking forward to these depositions, so I was going
[12:06.760 --> 12:09.680]  to chew this Chris Matty guy out.
[12:09.680 --> 12:14.320]  And then they're like, you're crazy if you go do your normal 10, 12, 14 hour work days,
[12:14.320 --> 12:15.320]  you can't do it.
[12:15.320 --> 12:18.960]  And so I got some more tests coming up today and tomorrow.
[12:18.960 --> 12:22.280]  And I'm going to get those knocked out and I should be fine.
[12:22.280 --> 12:24.720]  But I might have to go on some medication or whatever.
[12:24.720 --> 12:26.040]  And it's just the stress of this world.
[12:26.040 --> 12:27.440]  I really care.
[12:27.440 --> 12:34.600]  And I've never really made any bones about that, but again, they want me arrested when
[12:34.600 --> 12:39.200]  that's not even in the law to have another state's judge hold some money in contempt
[12:39.200 --> 12:44.320]  in a civil case and then have someone arrested until they sit in front of the former federal
[12:44.320 --> 12:48.240]  prosecutor that set up the innocent governor of Connecticut and sent him to prison.
[12:48.240 --> 12:49.360]  I mean, that's who these people are.
[12:49.360 --> 12:50.360]  They want me in jail.
[12:50.360 --> 12:51.760]  They want me silenced.
[12:51.760 --> 12:54.160]  They want you silenced.
[12:54.160 --> 12:56.200]  And so many of these articles are completely wrong.
[12:56.200 --> 12:59.920]  Jones was ordered to be in deposition, but he was on air Tuesday.
[12:59.920 --> 13:02.200]  The depositions were Wednesday and Thursday.
[13:02.200 --> 13:05.440]  Jones was at his studios doing the show on Wednesday.
[13:05.440 --> 13:07.680]  No, I wasn't in the studios doing it.
[13:07.680 --> 13:09.520]  In fact, I wasn't on the phone.
[13:09.520 --> 13:15.200]  I recorded it sitting here on my couch at home on an iPhone and sent it to him.
[13:15.200 --> 13:19.560]  So I'm sending this at eight in the morning to my crew and I'm going to try to just forget
[13:19.560 --> 13:26.080]  about all this and turn the computer off and all of it and just, you know, try to take
[13:26.080 --> 13:27.080]  care of myself.
[13:27.080 --> 13:29.120]  And yeah, sorry, leftist.
[13:29.120 --> 13:35.920]  My health comes before you and your plan to become famous off my name and to steal my
[13:35.920 --> 13:38.240]  identity and to say I'm the Sandy Hook man.
[13:38.240 --> 13:39.520]  You're the Sandy Hook people.
[13:39.520 --> 13:42.280]  You eat, drink, sleep and everything.
[13:42.280 --> 13:43.280]  That's what you do.
[13:43.280 --> 13:46.840]  I will continue to question any big event because a lot of times they're staged like
[13:46.840 --> 13:51.400]  the Gulf of Tonkin, Jesse Smollett, WNDs in Iraq.
[13:51.400 --> 13:55.680]  The list goes on and on, but you guys are the ones that dredge this up and misrepresent
[13:55.680 --> 13:59.160]  what I've said over and over again and it's disgusting.
[13:59.160 --> 14:00.880]  So you guys can move your depositions.
[14:00.880 --> 14:04.120]  You guys can do whatever you want, however you want, whenever you want.
[14:04.120 --> 14:07.920]  And then after all these depositions, all these things I've done, you turn around and
[14:07.920 --> 14:12.520]  say that I have not.
[14:12.520 --> 14:16.840]  You say that I have, you know, oh, I'm hiding and all this crap.
[14:16.840 --> 14:18.600]  Everybody knows Alex Jones doesn't hide.
[14:18.600 --> 14:20.720]  Everybody knows Alex Jones on the front lines of the situation.
[14:20.720 --> 14:23.280]  And I preach the list for supporting us.
[14:23.280 --> 14:27.840]  We intend to battle all of these kangaroo court operations, but it takes money to hire the
[14:27.840 --> 14:28.840]  lawyers to do it.
[14:28.840 --> 14:34.200]  So please support us at infowarstore.com or by calling toll free, triple eight, two, five,
[14:34.200 --> 14:38.160]  three, three, one, three, nine, also rather great sponsors have a lot of great products.
[14:38.160 --> 14:41.400]  And that's basically for everybody that tuned in today and want to know where Alex Jones
[14:41.400 --> 14:42.400]  is.
[14:42.400 --> 14:43.400]  That's it.
[14:43.400 --> 14:47.920]  And, you know, like I said, they want me arrested and again, they tell you, I'm defaulted.
[14:47.920 --> 14:48.920]  I'm already guilty.
[14:48.920 --> 14:52.400]  Well, then why am I having to testify if I'm guilty?
[14:52.400 --> 14:55.000]  And again, I'm happy to go do that.
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.240]  It's just that this isn't the time for me to be doing that and they got to move depositions.
[14:59.240 --> 15:02.880]  So I am as good as these people are.
[15:02.880 --> 15:03.880]  I have rights.
[15:03.880 --> 15:09.880]  I have a First Amendment and I have a right to my medical life and I'm sorry.
[15:09.880 --> 15:10.880]  You don't like that.
[15:10.880 --> 15:11.880]  They're not right.
[15:11.880 --> 15:12.880]  They're wrong.
[15:12.880 --> 15:13.880]  They're not the right thing to do.
[15:13.880 --> 15:14.880]  They're taking conservatives and Christians, healthcare away.
[15:14.880 --> 15:15.880]  Now, the left is the social credit score.
[15:15.880 --> 15:16.880]  These people are dangerous.
[15:16.880 --> 15:19.540]  Authoritarians, and they know it and they're going to be defeated.
[15:19.540 --> 15:20.540]  All right.
[15:20.540 --> 15:24.280]  Back to Owen Schroier and the live broadcast info.
[15:24.280 --> 15:25.280]  Warm.
[15:25.280 --> 15:27.740]  The front lines of human liberty.
[15:27.740 --> 15:28.740]  Right.
[15:28.740 --> 15:31.660]  We're gonna ride.
[15:31.660 --> 15:33.140]  Right.
[15:33.140 --> 15:44.900]  No, I haven't, but I'll get some tomorrow if you stay open.
[15:44.900 --> 15:59.780]  Oh my goodness, this is insane.

[16:06.780 --> 16:12.940]  year history, and that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding,
[16:12.940 --> 16:19.100]  the supply chains are broken down, and InfoWars is having serious trouble making its payroll
[16:19.100 --> 16:23.740]  and paying for operations, and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the
[16:23.740 --> 16:25.500]  globalists making their main move.
[16:25.500 --> 16:29.780]  InfoWars, its paradoxical, is more popular than ever, it is reaching more people than
[16:29.780 --> 16:34.340]  ever despite the censorship, but because of cost increasing and having to run our own
[16:34.340 --> 16:38.700]  infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of
[16:38.700 --> 16:39.700]  money.

[17:58.100 --> 18:01.300]  So I did it.
[18:01.300 --> 18:03.460]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[18:03.460 --> 18:08.100]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[18:08.100 --> 18:10.100]  and thank goodness for InfoWarsStore.com.
[18:10.100 --> 18:16.260]  Before I start out on a run, I throw down some Turbo Force to give me that energy I need
[18:16.260 --> 18:17.260]  to get going.
[18:17.260 --> 18:21.780]  You know, besides the energy, Turbo Force, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like
[18:21.780 --> 18:26.940]  vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained
[18:26.940 --> 18:30.500]  energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[18:30.500 --> 18:34.140]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis.
[18:34.140 --> 18:39.180]  I have bad joints, thanks mom, so this is great for giving my joints the extra support they
[18:39.180 --> 18:43.540]  need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[18:43.540 --> 18:48.100]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[18:48.100 --> 18:52.780]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, Turbo Force, that can
[18:52.780 --> 18:56.900]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and Sorilis can keep you
[18:56.900 --> 19:00.060]  moving and feeling great at any age.

[20:01.060 --> 20:29.300]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:29.300 --> 20:34.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer taking over now here on the Alex Jones show and
[20:34.540 --> 20:42.820]  let me just tell you, it's just absolutely crazy.
[20:42.820 --> 20:46.620]  I'm sorry.
[20:46.620 --> 20:53.660]  If you just knew what goes on behind the scenes here, I mean it's just insane.
[20:53.660 --> 20:55.420]  Folks nobody could do it like InfoWars though.
[20:55.420 --> 20:57.260]  I'll tell you that.
[20:57.260 --> 20:59.380]  Nobody could do it like InfoWars.
[20:59.380 --> 21:00.380]  You know what?
[21:00.380 --> 21:05.300]  Someday this will all be behind us and we'll probably write books and there'll be documentaries
[21:05.300 --> 21:08.100]  and it's just the whole shocking off factor of it.
[21:08.100 --> 21:12.780]  But I have to somehow clear my mind of all that, clear my mind of all the legal stuff
[21:12.780 --> 21:17.820]  I've been dealing with all morning as I just sit right down in this chair and get ready
[21:17.820 --> 21:19.660]  to cover all of this news.
[21:19.660 --> 21:31.660]  But let me just tell you, folks, have you ever heard the story of Mike the Durable?
[21:31.660 --> 21:35.380]  I was telling this to the crew the other day.
[21:35.380 --> 21:41.340]  There's this ancient folklore of Mike the Durable and apparently it's a true story.
[21:41.340 --> 21:45.820]  Maybe it's been exaggerated over time but there's actual legal documents because there
[21:45.820 --> 21:51.540]  was criminal charges involved in the murder of this man, Mike the Durable, where I believe
[21:51.540 --> 22:01.700]  it was the 1920s or 1930s, this old Irishman who was homeless and was just a total alcoholic,
[22:01.700 --> 22:04.140]  a boozehound.
[22:04.140 --> 22:07.860]  And I guess back in the day you could take out a life insurance policy on somebody and
[22:07.860 --> 22:12.220]  didn't even matter if they were poor or rich and you would get a payout if they died.
[22:12.220 --> 22:16.660]  And so this group of people, guys, you can plug it in, Mike the Durable into a search
[22:16.660 --> 22:17.660]  engine.
[22:17.660 --> 22:21.300]  You'll find all the stories and the legal records.
[22:21.300 --> 22:30.500]  And so these crooks took out a life insurance policy on Mike the Durable because he was
[22:30.500 --> 22:39.140]  this homeless boozehound that basically every day would drink until he passed out.
[22:39.140 --> 22:40.260]  And that was basically all he would do.
[22:40.260 --> 22:44.260]  He'd live on the street and he'd frequent these four or five bars that were owned by
[22:44.260 --> 22:54.660]  these whatever they called the booze dealers at the time.
[22:54.660 --> 23:00.140]  And they decided, hey, let's give this guy free drinks, we'll take out a life insurance
[23:00.140 --> 23:03.620]  policy and we'll tell this guy he can drink for free at our bars and he'll drink himself
[23:03.620 --> 23:07.380]  to death and we'll all get a couple thousand bucks payout.
[23:07.380 --> 23:12.820]  They say it was maybe between 60,000 and 100,000 a person for this life insurance policy.
[23:12.820 --> 23:17.180]  So they tried to give him, I'll make the story short, basically they tried to drink him to
[23:17.180 --> 23:18.380]  death, wouldn't die.
[23:18.380 --> 23:21.460]  They tried poisoning him with all this different stuff.
[23:21.460 --> 23:25.620]  I mean, the guy literally drank poison, rat poison, everything.
[23:25.620 --> 23:34.500]  And no matter what, Mike the Durable would show up the next day begging for a drink.
[23:34.500 --> 23:38.780]  They poisoned his drink, they made him drink antifreeze, rat poison.
[23:38.780 --> 23:44.260]  They'd strip him naked, throw him in the cold freezing snow and negative temperatures.
[23:44.260 --> 23:49.660]  They put tax into sandwiches and made him eat nails.
[23:49.660 --> 23:56.460]  I mean, they tried for months to kill this guy, Mike the Durable, and they could never
[23:56.460 --> 23:58.020]  do it.
[23:58.020 --> 24:03.980]  And so in the end, because they couldn't kill this guy and make it look like an accident
[24:03.980 --> 24:08.860]  because he was an alcoholic homeless guy, eventually they just took him to one of the
[24:08.860 --> 24:11.860]  guys' apartments and they just murdered him.
[24:11.860 --> 24:14.340]  And they got caught and they went to jail.
[24:14.340 --> 24:16.500]  One guy got the death penalty.
[24:16.500 --> 24:22.220]  It's just crazy ancient folklore of American history.
[24:22.220 --> 24:26.500]  But that's like the story of Info Wars, folks.
[24:26.500 --> 24:31.940]  They have poisoned our water, they have poisoned our food, they have made us drink formaldehyde,
[24:31.940 --> 24:36.420]  they've made us eat tax, they've thrown us in the freezing cold and dumped water over
[24:36.420 --> 24:38.700]  on us hoping we'll die.
[24:38.700 --> 24:42.540]  They pushed Mike the Durable, they paid a guy to run him over with a car.
[24:42.540 --> 24:43.540]  He survived that.
[24:43.540 --> 24:45.420]  I mean, literally, this story is crazy.
[24:45.420 --> 24:56.180]  My point is, we're like Mike the Durable here, except it's not about some unbelievable
[24:56.180 --> 25:00.140]  iris strength or something to drink a bunch of booze or have a stomach like a garbage
[25:00.140 --> 25:07.420]  disposal or whatever, it's you in the audience supporting us, praying for us, sharing the
[25:07.420 --> 25:14.020]  links that has made us Mike the Durable except Info Wars, the Durable.
[25:14.020 --> 25:16.500]  So why do I tell you that?
[25:16.500 --> 25:21.020]  Folks, they plan on Info Wars being long dead by now.
[25:21.020 --> 25:25.140]  They did not expect us to still be on air here today, they did not expect Alex Jones
[25:25.140 --> 25:31.780]  to still be operating Info Wars and yet here we are.
[25:31.780 --> 25:36.660]  And so it's almost like they're getting to the point at the end of the Mike the Durable
[25:36.660 --> 25:40.780]  story where they're just going to take us to the back alley and just, you know, shiv
[25:40.780 --> 25:46.180]  us to death because we were supposed to be dead by now and we're not.
[25:46.180 --> 25:50.580]  But this is just me kind of clearing the air because I've just been in and out of meetings
[25:50.580 --> 25:56.460]  all morning and then I had to rush in here and get all my prep work done for the show.
[25:56.460 --> 26:01.540]  But I just want you to know, we're like already passed our expiration date, we're already
[26:01.540 --> 26:07.820]  a miracle, we're already the Cinderella story, we're already Mike the Durable and they are
[26:07.820 --> 26:14.980]  just so ticked off, the enemies of this transmission, they are just so ticked off folks, you just
[26:14.980 --> 26:23.220]  have no idea and it is some personal stuff, it's some personal stuff for Alex Jones but
[26:23.220 --> 26:27.700]  it's more importantly this whole operation, the crew, the audience and everything we've
[26:27.700 --> 26:30.260]  done up to this point.
[26:30.260 --> 26:37.020]  In the end they did kill Mike the Durable.
[26:37.020 --> 26:42.540]  But I'm telling you, if it wasn't for your support at InfoWarsStore.com, we would not
[26:42.540 --> 26:46.980]  be here and I'm not going to get into some of the stuff that's happened here today.
[26:46.980 --> 26:51.340]  If Alex wants to break that news later on, he can.
[26:51.340 --> 26:58.700]  But folks, I mean they're throwing everything they can to try to get this place shut down.
[26:58.700 --> 27:04.500]  And we just, just like Mike the Durable, showed up every day to have that free alcohol, we
[27:04.500 --> 27:11.700]  just keep showing up and going live.
[27:11.700 --> 27:16.060]  So it's an honor to be here with you today.
[27:16.060 --> 27:21.300]  You're all part of this, every day on air is a victory for free speech now.
[27:21.300 --> 27:27.340]  And I've said it before, I'll say it again, the fate of InfoWars and the fate of this
[27:27.340 --> 27:36.140]  transmission will ultimately be the fate of free speech in America.
[27:36.140 --> 27:40.740]  And they've already, you've already seen with the test case of Alex Jones and InfoWars
[27:40.740 --> 27:42.700]  and the censorship.
[27:42.700 --> 27:46.900]  And now everything they've done since then, censoring President Trump, censoring the President
[27:46.900 --> 27:53.180]  of Brazil, censoring any commentator that doesn't say men or women, censoring people
[27:53.180 --> 27:58.460]  that don't support the mask or the vaccines, censoring doctors, censoring members of Congress,
[27:58.460 --> 28:00.340]  you've seen it all.
[28:00.340 --> 28:03.420]  What was the test case?
[28:03.420 --> 28:06.600]  InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[28:06.600 --> 28:12.260]  And so if they can completely annihilate us from the free speech market, that will then
[28:12.260 --> 28:16.940]  be the test case and the proof that they can do it to anybody.
[28:16.940 --> 28:22.060]  Now I've said that, I'm going to urge you to support us at infowarstore.com.
[28:22.060 --> 28:27.140]  We need to support folks, buy a great supplement, buy the great fizzy magnesium that's so popular
[28:27.140 --> 28:34.020]  and 25% off, buy the vitamin D gummies that are popular and 25% off, buy the vaso beat
[28:34.020 --> 28:38.620]  complete, it's good for your blood flow, 40% off, the supplements are great, the t-shirts,
[28:38.620 --> 28:41.380]  the hats, the air filters, the water filters are all of it.
[28:41.380 --> 28:49.220]  Or just go make a donation at saveinfowars.com or on the donation page at infowarstore.com.
[28:49.220 --> 28:53.060]  We're going to see this through to the end folks and I hope that the end is not even
[28:53.060 --> 28:54.060]  in sight.
[28:54.060 --> 28:57.860]  But let me tell you, the long knives, the swords, the cannons, everything is out against
[28:57.860 --> 28:58.860]  us today.
[28:58.860 --> 29:06.100]  Our world is so full of hype, we are force fed, dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate
[29:06.100 --> 29:11.660]  media, by the controlled churches and the universities, and why is this the case?
[29:11.660 --> 29:16.620]  Because we innately, by God, have been given the keys to our own minds, our own psyches,
[29:16.620 --> 29:23.340]  our own souls, and by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves and transcend the quote
[29:23.340 --> 29:28.820]  fallen or sinful state, so the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring
[29:28.820 --> 29:34.300]  into our bodies to change who we are, are only lowering us, they're only making us
[29:34.300 --> 29:37.100]  more depressed, and in the end they're only making us less fulfilled.
[29:37.100 --> 29:42.380]  It is only by going within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower
[29:42.380 --> 29:43.380]  ourselves.
[29:43.380 --> 29:47.460]  That's why the globalist, bombardist, and toxins and chemicals to block us getting the
[29:47.460 --> 29:52.820]  normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able
[29:52.820 --> 29:55.820]  to basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[29:55.820 --> 29:59.700]  And that's where the incredible products come in at InfoWarsLife.com.

[30:42.260 --> 30:44.580]  the spear, the InfoWars operation.
[30:44.580 --> 30:45.940]  It is a 360 win.
[30:45.940 --> 30:50.420]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's
[30:50.420 --> 30:53.020]  natural defenses and keep InfoWars on the air.
[30:53.020 --> 30:55.460]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[30:55.460 --> 30:59.980]  Take action now, InfoWarsStore.com.
[30:59.980 --> 31:04.100]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans.
[31:04.100 --> 31:09.700]  They financed major universities, they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing
[31:09.700 --> 31:14.300]  their propaganda of New York Times, other major newspapers, that the family as we know
[31:14.300 --> 31:17.380]  it is a bad thing and must be ended.
[31:17.380 --> 31:22.700]  The first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that cooking
[31:22.700 --> 31:26.980]  dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[31:26.980 --> 31:31.380]  I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four national daughter.
[31:31.380 --> 31:35.460]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well, I love to make breakfast.
[31:35.460 --> 31:39.540]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be
[31:39.540 --> 31:44.420]  nurturative and then all sit down together and have the communal event.
[31:44.420 --> 31:49.940]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions
[31:49.940 --> 31:50.940]  are coming together.
[31:50.940 --> 31:51.940]  They really are.
[31:51.940 --> 31:57.420]  Sick, evil, scientific, cult of filth that will domesticate us and turn us into lab rats.
[31:57.420 --> 32:00.380]  We cannot let this continue.
[32:00.380 --> 32:05.500]  Experience the next level in high powered energy new tropics with our latest brain force offering,

[32:16.420 --> 32:22.140]  Three of toxic additives each ingredient is specifically selected for its many key properties.

[32:26.540 --> 32:32.340]  Oranaceae, which is loaded with energy compounds and antioxidants that have been used by Amazonian
[32:32.340 --> 32:34.060]  tribes for centuries.
[32:34.060 --> 32:39.260]  AlphaGPC, a natural compound found in the brain that delivers an essential nutrient,
[32:39.260 --> 32:44.420]  Koli and Ginkoli, which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant content.
[32:44.420 --> 32:48.540]  This product is more than twice the servings of our Brain Force Plus as well, so you know
[32:48.540 --> 32:50.900]  it's packed full of the good stuff.

[33:20.180 --> 33:21.900]  You want to stop tyranny?
[33:21.900 --> 33:23.660]  Well so does he.
[33:23.660 --> 33:25.580]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:25.580 --> 33:32.580]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[33:32.580 --> 33:38.620]  Alright, let me kind of hit the reset button here and properly lay out what we have coming
[33:38.620 --> 33:40.620]  up.
[33:40.620 --> 33:47.740]  We don't have any guests today on the Alex Jones show, but I have the stacks and stacks
[33:47.740 --> 33:49.940]  of news in front of me.
[33:49.940 --> 33:56.060]  So let me tell you what we're going to be covering.
[33:56.060 --> 34:05.140]  This is the case every day now where I have a stack of news on my desk involving the grooming
[34:05.140 --> 34:13.420]  of young children at elementary schools and grade schools and high schools.
[34:13.420 --> 34:22.220]  And even last night, I'm at the gym and I'm playing basketball and there's a couple high
[34:22.220 --> 34:28.060]  school kids up there and a couple college kids and then me and my buddies are just, you know,
[34:28.060 --> 34:32.420]  talking politics and we know what's going on and some of these college kids are listening
[34:32.420 --> 34:35.540]  to us and they're just basically just aghast.
[34:35.540 --> 34:38.060]  They're like, how can you even talk like that?
[34:38.060 --> 34:42.620]  And we're like, this is what's going on, man, like sorry to bring you up to reality here.
[34:42.620 --> 34:45.100]  This is the big boy world.
[34:45.100 --> 34:50.900]  And we start talking about the grooming in the schools.
[34:50.900 --> 34:57.900]  And this one individual who's college age doesn't believe it.
[34:57.900 --> 34:59.700]  He's like, this is not going on.
[34:59.700 --> 35:00.700]  They're not grooming the kids.
[35:00.700 --> 35:05.060]  They're not doing gay pride parades for kids like, come on, like you guys are crazy.
[35:05.060 --> 35:09.060]  And it just so happens, and I don't want to give out too much information here, but it
[35:09.060 --> 35:15.420]  just so happens that one of the individuals went to a high school where they were doing
[35:15.420 --> 35:17.300]  the pride week this week.
[35:17.300 --> 35:21.140]  He's like, yeah, this is actually going on.
[35:21.140 --> 35:26.900]  And then here's the list of all the gay things they sent out for us at the beginning of the
[35:26.900 --> 35:28.900]  week.
[35:28.900 --> 35:33.540]  And this college kid is not uninformed.
[35:33.540 --> 35:35.380]  I mean, he was actually a pretty smart kid.
[35:35.380 --> 35:37.540]  He just had no idea all this was going on.
[35:37.540 --> 35:41.980]  And he's just like, I mean, red pilling in real time.
[35:41.980 --> 35:45.540]  Now I don't really like to do that when I'm at the gym.
[35:45.540 --> 35:48.180]  That's kind of an escapism thing for me.
[35:48.180 --> 35:51.220]  And I'm already recognized by half the people there and they want to talk to me.
[35:51.220 --> 35:52.220]  And it's all good.
[35:52.220 --> 35:56.820]  I'm just saying I don't really like doing that, but I mean, this, why am I making a
[35:56.820 --> 35:59.340]  big deal of this, folks?
[35:59.340 --> 36:05.420]  This is the type of thing that no matter what your politics are, as long as you're not a
[36:05.420 --> 36:13.100]  radical leftist, a radical communist, a just full on brainwashed zombie, this is the kind
[36:13.100 --> 36:18.340]  of stuff that is going to make people wake up and realize what's going on.
[36:18.340 --> 36:23.620]  And I mean, you can choose strategically to attach this to the left or you can let them
[36:23.620 --> 36:25.020]  figure that out for themselves.
[36:25.020 --> 36:31.420]  But let me just tell you, the average person that doesn't really know what's going on
[36:31.420 --> 36:35.980]  because they don't really immerse themselves in the day-to-day politics or the cultural
[36:35.980 --> 36:43.700]  politics, when they see this stuff, it's a shocking all factor.
[36:43.700 --> 36:50.740]  And so what I'm saying is every day now, I have a stack of news on my desk that's all
[36:50.740 --> 36:56.940]  about how the school system is grooming children, grooming them sexually.
[36:56.940 --> 37:05.420]  I mean, quite honestly, the best comparison to be made here is Epstein Island and Epstein's
[37:05.420 --> 37:09.060]  sex slaves.
[37:09.060 --> 37:12.980]  And I understand there's a lot of arguments and counterpoints you can make, but really
[37:12.980 --> 37:16.780]  at a base level, is it not the same thing?
[37:16.780 --> 37:22.300]  Epstein grooming little girls and women into being sex slaves, grooming them into that.
[37:22.300 --> 37:27.420]  Is this not what they're doing in the schools with these kids grooming them to be sexual
[37:27.420 --> 37:29.460]  deviance?
[37:29.460 --> 37:31.540]  What would you call it?
[37:31.540 --> 37:38.840]  What would you call it when I have a document here, and it's, well, I should say I have
[37:38.840 --> 37:46.380]  multiple documents here of states, multiple states, where they're teaching prepubescent
[37:46.380 --> 37:52.780]  students all about anal sex and masturbation and sex toys and everything else that you
[37:52.780 --> 37:56.020]  can imagine.
[37:56.020 --> 37:58.900]  Pre-pubescent kids.
[37:58.900 --> 38:04.260]  Kids that should be, biggest concern should be if they scrape their knee, climbing a fence
[38:04.260 --> 38:09.340]  or climbing a tree or riding a bike or getting home in time for dinner.
[38:09.340 --> 38:13.060]  You know, maybe scrape it up a couple bucks so you can go down the street to the local
[38:13.060 --> 38:18.340]  convenience store and get a candy bar or a soda pop or something, whatever the latest
[38:18.340 --> 38:22.580]  trend is for games for kids, a video game or a card game.
[38:22.580 --> 38:31.380]  No, now it's learn how to have gay sex and learn about all the different sexual kinks
[38:31.380 --> 38:37.780]  before you even hit puberty, folks, that is grooming.
[38:37.780 --> 38:40.740]  So I've got a stack of that news.
[38:40.740 --> 38:43.500]  We've got the government illegally spying on its citizens.
[38:43.500 --> 38:46.220]  Remember James Clapper lied about all that.
[38:46.220 --> 38:49.540]  Not just spying on journalists, which we all assume they do.
[38:49.540 --> 38:50.540]  We now know it.
[38:50.540 --> 38:52.820]  It's triple quadruple confirmed.
[38:52.820 --> 39:03.540]  Also with DNA databases, hmm, oh, and then remember, they said, you got a PCR test.
[39:03.540 --> 39:09.620]  A lot of you just submitted your DNA to a data bank unwittingly.
[39:09.620 --> 39:12.740]  Remember that little, remember that little nugget they admitted, it's like, oh, yeah,
[39:12.740 --> 39:13.860]  you got the no swab.
[39:13.860 --> 39:17.460]  We collected your DNA, really?
[39:17.460 --> 39:18.860]  Did you sign off on that?
[39:18.860 --> 39:24.060]  No, but they did it anyway.
[39:24.060 --> 39:29.260]  We've got some political news as apparently Biden is going to Europe.
[39:29.260 --> 39:33.140]  I don't know if anybody's seen Biden since they put out that fake picture on Twitter
[39:33.140 --> 39:34.140]  yesterday.
[39:34.140 --> 39:39.340]  Yes, the White House got caught putting up a fake picture on Twitter, or I should say
[39:39.340 --> 39:44.060]  it was, I guess it was a real picture, but from a long time ago.
[39:44.060 --> 39:45.940]  And they say, here's Biden going to Europe.
[39:45.940 --> 39:51.140]  And they post a picture from last year or two years ago, or who even knows when.
[39:51.140 --> 39:54.260]  They didn't get away with that.
[39:54.260 --> 40:00.540]  Really the biggest story is this one that's right in front of me here with the graph.
[40:00.540 --> 40:09.740]  And this is just adding on to the pile of evidence or adding on to the data that we
[40:09.740 --> 40:10.740]  have.
[40:10.740 --> 40:14.060]  I mean, are we at the point of it's the cherry on top yet?
[40:14.060 --> 40:17.260]  Is it the bow on top yet?
[40:17.260 --> 40:27.500]  The latest data out of Canada totally proves, ladies and gentlemen, 90% of COVID deaths are
[40:27.500 --> 40:30.460]  vaccinated individuals.
[40:30.460 --> 40:40.460]  Let me repeat, the latest data out of Canada, 90% of COVID deaths are vaccinated individuals.
[40:40.460 --> 40:49.820]  90% of COVID deaths are vaccinated individuals, 90% of COVID deaths are vaccinated individuals.
[40:49.820 --> 40:52.220]  Do you get it yet?
[40:52.220 --> 40:58.060]  90% of COVID deaths happen in hospitals.
[40:58.060 --> 41:00.780]  It's actually probably more than that.
[41:00.780 --> 41:03.460]  But I think you get the gist of it.
[41:03.460 --> 41:09.060]  So we'll be covering that, not to mention how now all these countries that were the
[41:09.060 --> 41:12.860]  most tyrannical when it came to the mask and vaccine mandates, oh, now all of a sudden
[41:12.860 --> 41:15.900]  they're just, oh, never mind.
[41:15.900 --> 41:23.020]  Oh, so you put people through all that torment, all that torture, and then you just say never
[41:23.020 --> 41:25.540]  mind, which, again, is a good thing.
[41:25.540 --> 41:30.980]  You shouldn't be making people take a forced experimental medical procedure, and you shouldn't
[41:30.980 --> 41:32.820]  be forcing people to wear a face muzzle.
[41:32.820 --> 41:38.580]  But it's funny how you just say, okay, never mind, and it's just, oh, oh, yay, they tortured
[41:38.580 --> 41:41.020]  us all these years, and it's back.
[41:41.020 --> 41:47.380]  And what is going on where Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Jen Psaki all get COVID
[41:47.380 --> 41:49.060]  in the same week?
[41:49.060 --> 41:50.500]  Were they all at an event together?
[41:50.500 --> 41:53.100]  What event was that?
[41:53.100 --> 41:55.300]  But whether or not there's something, they're not.
[41:55.300 --> 41:59.460]  They're all vaccinated, and they say, oh, thank you for the vaccine.
[41:59.460 --> 42:04.540]  I've got COVID for the second time in six months, but the fact that just shows the vaccine
[42:04.540 --> 42:06.740]  is working.
[42:06.740 --> 42:11.540]  Really interesting.
[42:11.540 --> 42:14.820]  What happened to that winter of death, by the way?
[42:14.820 --> 42:18.460]  Me and my entire crew were supposed to be dead, according to Joe Biden, because we didn't
[42:18.460 --> 42:20.220]  get the vaccine.
[42:20.220 --> 42:22.460]  That didn't happen.
[42:22.460 --> 42:26.900]  We do have the final day of the Judge Jackson hearing going on right now.
[42:26.900 --> 42:27.900]  Boy, oh boy.
[42:27.900 --> 42:33.340]  I mean, they're going to confirm this pedophile protecting judge, no doubt.
[42:33.340 --> 42:38.660]  I would say the odds are, but man, oh man, is this going to be, this is by far the most
[42:38.660 --> 42:43.500]  embarrassing moment in the United States Supreme Court history will be when Judge Jackson gets
[42:43.500 --> 42:48.900]  confirmed, a pedophile protecting judge, and even maybe worse than that, just a low
[42:48.900 --> 42:55.900]  IQ nitwit who's only gotten to where she's at because of her skin color, literally.
[43:48.900 --> 44:03.140]  It's a great sponsor.
[44:03.140 --> 44:07.380]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high quality, high-rated

[45:38.180 --> 45:39.180]  So be it.
[45:39.180 --> 45:42.100]  Make them silence us by force.

[47:26.180 --> 47:31.180]  Back here live on the Alex Jones show brought to you by you.
[47:31.180 --> 47:34.180]  Shopping at infowarstore.com.
[47:34.180 --> 47:38.180]  The big story for me today, and here's the problem.
[47:38.180 --> 47:45.180]  The vaccine stuff, the COVID stuff, the mask stuff, all the medical tyranny, all the medical fascism,
[47:45.180 --> 47:49.180]  it really has been put in the rear view.
[47:49.180 --> 47:55.180]  And so there's no closure on who made the weaponized virus in a biological warfare lab.
[47:55.180 --> 48:02.180]  There's no closure on all the things that were done to us in the process in the last two years
[48:02.180 --> 48:08.180]  by our government destroying the economy, destroying the supply chain, destroying people's morale,
[48:08.180 --> 48:12.180]  psychology, the torture with the face masks and everything else.
[48:12.180 --> 48:14.180]  There's no closure. There's no justice there.
[48:14.180 --> 48:17.180]  It just gets to be in the rear view now.
[48:17.180 --> 48:23.180]  And we're just so relieved that we're not dealing with it anymore that we just kind of let it fade off into the distance
[48:23.180 --> 48:28.180]  and hopefully we should be bringing it back to the fore, looking for justice, looking to punish those
[48:28.180 --> 48:32.180]  that did so much damage to our civilization in the process.
[48:32.180 --> 48:36.180]  And I still hear it to this day, it's the most frustrating thing ever.
[48:36.180 --> 48:42.180]  The virus shut down schools, the virus did this, the virus did that, the virus didn't do a damn thing.
[48:42.180 --> 48:44.180]  The government did all of that.
[48:44.180 --> 48:52.180]  But see, that's the problem is when you want to properly attribute the blame where it belongs,
[48:52.180 --> 49:00.180]  when you actually want to attribute the blame to those responsible, then all of a sudden it's no, no, no, no, no.
[49:00.180 --> 49:03.180]  But if you want to blame the virus for everything, then it's okay.
[49:03.180 --> 49:05.180]  Blame the virus, the virus did all this bad stuff.
[49:05.180 --> 49:09.180]  But then when you point out it was the government, then it was, oh, never mind, it's not bad.
[49:09.180 --> 49:10.180]  It's good, actually.
[49:10.180 --> 49:14.180]  When the government does it, it's good, but if a virus did it, it's bad.
[49:14.180 --> 49:21.180]  So no, it's not going to go in the rear view because there needs to be justice, there needs to be closure here.
[49:21.180 --> 49:25.180]  The individuals that made this virus in a lab need to be punished.
[49:25.180 --> 49:29.180]  And those that covered it up need to be investigated.
[49:29.180 --> 49:31.180]  But that's just the beginning.
[49:31.180 --> 49:34.180]  Then you get into the vaccines.
[49:34.180 --> 49:45.180]  Now, I can pull data out of any country on earth from any period of time, post-vaccine.
[49:45.180 --> 49:54.180]  And you're going to get, except for maybe a plus minus five to 10% difference,
[49:54.180 --> 50:02.180]  you're going to get the same result that we got out of the most recent data from Canada.
[50:02.180 --> 50:08.180]  And the Daily Expose has the story that the public documents are available.
[50:08.180 --> 50:12.180]  Canada's pandemic of the fully vaccinated.
[50:12.180 --> 50:17.180]  Seven in every 10 COVID-19 deaths are among fully vaccinated according to official data.
[50:17.180 --> 50:19.180]  Trudeau's government trying to cover it up.
[50:19.180 --> 50:20.180]  Now, think about that, though.
[50:20.180 --> 50:24.180]  That's not even really the full truth.
[50:24.180 --> 50:28.180]  That's fully vaccinated, which is just as bad.
[50:28.180 --> 50:37.180]  They're saying 70% of fully vaccinated individuals or rather 70% of COVID deaths are fully vaccinated individuals.
[50:37.180 --> 50:40.180]  So that's the multiple vaccines.
[50:40.180 --> 50:54.180]  But if it's just, if it's just, if you're not talking about multiple vaccines, but just one vaccine, 90, the number is 90% of COVID deaths are among the vaccinated.
[50:54.180 --> 50:57.180]  So here's what you have to do now.
[50:57.180 --> 51:07.180]  How many of these deaths are from COVID and how many of these deaths are from vaccines?
[51:07.180 --> 51:10.180]  Now, the correlation here is pretty clear.
[51:10.180 --> 51:20.180]  If you're vaccinated, you have a higher chance of death from COVID than if you're not vaccinated.
[51:20.180 --> 51:35.180]  So really, we've reached a point where I would say probably half of the COVID deaths are actually from the vaccine.
[51:35.180 --> 51:38.180]  Because the data here doesn't lie.
[51:38.180 --> 51:44.180]  Now, obviously you can't make that claim before the vaccine comes out.
[51:44.180 --> 51:53.180]  But if you just look at the data post vaccine, most COVID deaths are in vaccinated individuals.
[51:53.180 --> 51:57.180]  So is that really COVID or is that the vaccine?
[51:57.180 --> 52:11.180]  Because when the non-vaccinated are not dying from COVID, but the vaccinated are, well, there's your controlled study right there.
[52:11.180 --> 52:14.180]  And what is the variable?
[52:14.180 --> 52:16.180]  The vaccine.
[52:16.180 --> 52:26.180]  So it's pretty clear as if there wasn't enough evidence and data and shocking reporting and whistleblowing.
[52:26.180 --> 52:28.180]  It just continues to pile up.
[52:28.180 --> 52:34.180]  The vaccines are killing people.
[52:34.180 --> 52:53.180]  And to me, the proof is now in the pudding here and it's really just an unbelievable attempt at a cover up with Hillary Clinton and Jen Psaki and Barack Obama
[52:53.180 --> 52:57.180]  all getting COVID in the same week.
[52:57.180 --> 53:00.180]  Now, were they at some secret meeting together?
[53:00.180 --> 53:02.180]  Or is that just a coincidence?
[53:02.180 --> 53:04.180]  People are asking.
[53:04.180 --> 53:07.180]  But each one of them, oh, I've got COVID.
[53:07.180 --> 53:09.180]  By the way, I'm fine.
[53:09.180 --> 53:14.180]  The vaccine is working.
[53:14.180 --> 53:16.180]  Literally all within a week here.
[53:16.180 --> 53:18.180]  Clinton, Obama and Psaki get COVID.
[53:18.180 --> 53:20.180]  Now, they could all be lying.
[53:20.180 --> 53:26.180]  I don't think that would shock anybody, Obama, Clinton and Psaki telling a lie.
[53:26.180 --> 53:31.180]  Well, that's like the sun rising in setting.
[53:31.180 --> 53:37.180]  That's like water is in a river or a lake.
[53:37.180 --> 53:42.180]  So yeah, Clinton, Obama, Psaki could all be lying about this for various reasons.
[53:42.180 --> 53:43.180]  But it's hilarious.
[53:43.180 --> 53:44.180]  They get COVID.
[53:44.180 --> 53:45.180]  They say, hey, it's not bad.
[53:45.180 --> 53:48.180]  By the way, the vaccine is working.
[53:48.180 --> 53:49.180]  An incredible admission.
[53:49.180 --> 53:55.180]  So you admit COVID is not that bad and it's not deadly and that the vaccine is not working
[53:55.180 --> 53:57.180]  all in one statement.
[53:57.180 --> 54:07.180]  But yet somehow that's used to promote the vaccine and the COVID fear mongering.
[54:07.180 --> 54:11.180]  It's total clown world, folks.
[54:11.180 --> 54:18.180]  It's total clown world where the exact evidence and proof you would need that you don't need
[54:18.180 --> 54:27.180]  to be afraid of COVID and that the vaccine isn't working and they somehow use that to
[54:27.180 --> 54:32.180]  argue the vaccine is working and you still need to be afraid of COVID.
[54:32.180 --> 54:35.180]  Only in the bizarro clown world does that work.
[54:35.180 --> 54:42.180]  And it's the ancient quotable from Voltaire.
[54:42.180 --> 54:47.180]  If they can make you believe absurdities, they can make you commit atrocities.
[54:47.180 --> 54:51.180]  This is what's happening on so many different levels.
[54:51.180 --> 54:54.180]  But let's move on.
[54:54.180 --> 55:01.180]  Ten CEOs of airlines call on President Biden to move on from mask mandates on flight.
[55:01.180 --> 55:03.180]  So people aren't flying anymore.
[55:03.180 --> 55:05.180]  They're sick of the mask.
[55:05.180 --> 55:12.180]  The airlines are starting to realize that and they want the federal mandate on the planes to be revoked.
[55:12.180 --> 55:14.180]  We'll see how that goes.
[55:14.180 --> 55:18.180]  New Zealand scraps vaccine passports and mandates.
[55:18.180 --> 55:24.180]  Wow, after they were so hardcore and how important it all was, now they're scrapping it.
[55:24.180 --> 55:29.180]  But not before they vaccinated a bunch of people that are probably going to die from it.
[55:29.180 --> 55:36.180]  Ignored by fake news media, U.S. COVID deaths to pass one million mark today, more than 600,000 deaths under Joe Biden.
[55:36.180 --> 55:39.180]  Yeah, remember, oh, every COVID deaths is Trump's fault.
[55:39.180 --> 55:40.180]  It's all Trump.
[55:40.180 --> 55:43.180]  Look at the blood on Trump's hands from COVID.
[55:43.180 --> 55:47.180]  Well, now it's Biden with more COVID deaths and that's with the vaccine.
[55:47.180 --> 55:49.180]  So, you know, maybe there's another story there.
[55:49.180 --> 55:51.180]  We know what it is. The vaccine is killing people.
[55:51.180 --> 55:54.180]  But oh, the media says Biden's doing such a great job.
[55:54.180 --> 55:59.180]  More people dead under Biden, but that's because he's doing a better job than Trump.
[55:59.180 --> 56:05.180]  An individual recounts what their child is going through in school.
[56:05.180 --> 56:09.180]  I mean, this is just disgusting stuff in the city of Chicago.
[56:09.180 --> 56:17.180]  My son who faces severe speech delays and needs to see faces to be able to see his own and be able to see his own,
[56:17.180 --> 56:21.180]  toddled off happily to pre-case at school.
[56:21.180 --> 56:29.180]  He was returned to me two hours later with a mask forcibly tied to his face by a teacher crying.
[56:29.180 --> 56:37.180]  What kind of sick, demented freak would tie a mask to a kid's face?
[56:37.180 --> 56:39.180]  We've seen these liberal teachers. They are tying them off.
[56:39.180 --> 56:41.180]  They're taping them. They're duct taping them.
[56:41.180 --> 56:43.180]  I mean, it's basically torture.
[56:43.180 --> 56:45.180]  And who is it every time?
[56:45.180 --> 56:50.180]  It's a freak show leftist teacher that wants to torture your kids.
[56:50.180 --> 56:54.180]  Either sexually pervert them or literally put a muzzle over their face.
[56:54.180 --> 56:57.180]  Israel COVID-19 cases surge.
[56:57.180 --> 56:59.180]  83.1% are vaccinated.
[56:59.180 --> 57:04.180]  That's what I'm saying. It's about 5 to 10% give either way on the numbers.
[57:04.180 --> 57:08.180]  You work off 85% as the number.
[57:08.180 --> 57:13.180]  85% of COVID deaths, give or take 10% or 5%, I'd say probably.
[57:13.180 --> 57:21.180]  Give or take 5% from 85% of COVID deaths are vaccinated no matter which country you investigate.
[57:21.180 --> 57:28.180]  Nova Scotia adds 13 types of cancer to workplace insurance coverage for firefighters where they force them to get the vaccine.
[57:28.180 --> 57:32.180]  Now all of a sudden all these new cancers are popping up so they have to cover it.
[57:32.180 --> 57:34.180]  Huh, wonder what that's about.
[57:34.180 --> 57:39.180]  Italian champion cyclist collapses after first stage of Volta in Spain.
[57:39.180 --> 57:41.180]  CPR performed at the scene.
[57:41.180 --> 58:10.180]  Another account of an athlete vaccinated passes out on the field of competition.
[58:10.180 --> 58:14.180]  Now with Band-Aid video getting close to 10 million views a day,
[58:14.180 --> 58:21.180]  we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[58:21.180 --> 58:26.180]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[58:26.180 --> 58:32.180]  Info wars and Band-Aid video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide.
[58:32.180 --> 58:39.180]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[58:39.180 --> 58:42.180]  The biggest sale in info wars history is going right now.
[58:42.180 --> 58:48.180]  The mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off getting credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever.
[58:48.180 --> 58:51.180]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[58:51.180 --> 58:56.180]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[58:56.180 --> 59:05.180]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[59:05.180 --> 59:09.180]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[59:09.180 --> 59:18.180]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[59:18.180 --> 59:21.180]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com.

[59:43.180 --> 1:00:01.180]  It's amazing.
[1:00:13.180 --> 1:00:31.180]  Remember all the lies the Democrats, the Biden administration and the media told us about inflation?
[1:00:31.180 --> 1:00:48.180]  Well, in case you don't, here is a short compilation in a time frame in a linear timeframe of the different messaging and claims that have been made about inflation from inflation doesn't exist.
[1:00:48.180 --> 1:00:49.180]  It's not going to happen.
[1:00:49.180 --> 1:00:50.180]  It's temporary.
[1:00:50.180 --> 1:00:51.180]  It's COVID.
[1:00:51.180 --> 1:00:52.180]  It's Putin.
[1:00:52.180 --> 1:01:00.180]  Here it is in a short video clip just showing you how this administration lies about everything.
[1:01:00.180 --> 1:01:03.180]  But in this case, specifically inflation.
[1:01:03.180 --> 1:01:05.180]  Anyway, thank you guys.
[1:01:05.180 --> 1:01:12.180]  Should Americans be worried about inflation, sir?
[1:01:12.180 --> 1:01:18.180]  Well, I really doubt that we're going to see an inflationary cycle.
[1:01:18.180 --> 1:01:26.180]  And by the way, talking about inflation, the overwhelming consensus is going to pop up a little bit and then go back down.
[1:01:26.180 --> 1:01:32.180]  I don't know anybody, including Larry Summers, who's a friend of mine who's worried about inflation.
[1:01:32.180 --> 1:01:38.180]  We also know that as our economy has come roaring back, we've seen some price increases.
[1:01:38.180 --> 1:01:43.180]  Some folks have raised worries that this could be a sign of persistent inflation.
[1:01:43.180 --> 1:01:46.180]  But that's not our view.
[1:01:46.180 --> 1:01:47.180]  Inflation, you said?
[1:01:47.180 --> 1:01:48.180]  Okay.
[1:01:48.180 --> 1:01:59.180]  Well, I would first say that one of the steps that we've taken as an administration is to provide a range of assistance to the American people, whether it is in the form of $1,400 checks.
[1:01:59.180 --> 1:02:11.180]  Caitlin, if you actually look at the numbers and the trends over the last several months, it shows that cornflation was not only below expectations, but it decelerated from last month.
[1:02:11.180 --> 1:02:18.180]  You had told us at a town hall, I think it was in July, that it was just near-term inflation.
[1:02:18.180 --> 1:02:22.180]  Number one thing that the president can do is help get COVID under control.
[1:02:22.180 --> 1:02:28.180]  That, we know, is the root cause of inflation and the price increases we're seeing for a range of reasons.
[1:02:28.180 --> 1:02:38.180]  And finally, even as we meet, even as we meet to work out this challenge, it's important to maintain perspective.
[1:02:38.180 --> 1:02:53.180]  Prices have gone up, and families and individuals are dealing with the realities of that bread costs more, the gas costs more.
[1:02:53.180 --> 1:02:56.180]  Now, we have to understand what that means.
[1:02:56.180 --> 1:02:59.180]  That's about the cost of living going up.
[1:02:59.180 --> 1:03:04.180]  When people go to the grocery store and a pound of meat is more expensive than it should be, we agree.
[1:03:04.180 --> 1:03:06.180]  That's less related to supply chain issues.
[1:03:06.180 --> 1:03:09.180]  The inflation has everything to do with the supply chain.
[1:03:09.180 --> 1:03:13.180]  Inflation is up. It's up.
[1:03:13.180 --> 1:03:18.180]  The second big reason for inflation is Vladimir Putin.
[1:03:18.180 --> 1:03:21.180]  Ah, there it is.
[1:03:21.180 --> 1:03:24.180]  Yeah, and I love this joke going around.
[1:03:24.180 --> 1:03:29.180]  Here's one example from I.C.T., but I'll do my own little rendition.
[1:03:29.180 --> 1:03:36.180]  Guys, last night I was out and about and I was robbed.
[1:03:36.180 --> 1:03:41.180]  I was robbed, ladies and gentlemen, and the police came.
[1:03:41.180 --> 1:03:43.180]  I reported it to the police and the police showed up.
[1:03:43.180 --> 1:03:44.180]  They said, well, do you know who robbed you?
[1:03:44.180 --> 1:03:47.180]  And I said, yeah, it was pump number five.
[1:03:47.180 --> 1:03:49.180]  I was robbed.
[1:03:49.180 --> 1:03:53.180]  And so that's the big joke, but that's just part of the inflation.
[1:03:53.180 --> 1:03:57.180]  It's just incredible what liars they are, but the world sees it.
[1:03:57.180 --> 1:04:03.180]  And really this administration is by far the most pathetic in American history,
[1:04:03.180 --> 1:04:05.180]  certainly modern-day history.
[1:04:05.180 --> 1:04:08.180]  I mean, it's abysmal. It's an embarrassment.
[1:04:08.180 --> 1:04:11.180]  It's a clown show. I mean, you name it.
[1:04:11.180 --> 1:04:13.180]  It's undeniable.
[1:04:13.180 --> 1:04:21.180]  And I'm just thinking if we can somehow save this country politically,
[1:04:21.180 --> 1:04:25.180]  which I think at this point, and I know that a lot of people may not agree with this,
[1:04:25.180 --> 1:04:29.180]  but at this point it probably would mean Trump getting back into the White House
[1:04:29.180 --> 1:04:34.180]  and hopefully being a lot better in his second go around
[1:04:34.180 --> 1:04:38.180]  and having a much better group of people surrounding him in his administration.
[1:04:38.180 --> 1:04:43.180]  You understand that would be like sometimes in a football game or a hockey game or something,
[1:04:43.180 --> 1:04:47.180]  they'll have like the little Pee Wee athletes play at halftime in between the breaks.
[1:04:47.180 --> 1:04:51.180]  They'll have little Pee Wee players running around and just, OK, it's kind of fun.
[1:04:51.180 --> 1:04:54.180]  And then the professionals get back up and you're like, oh, those are pros.
[1:04:54.180 --> 1:04:58.180]  I mean, that's what it's going to look like in comparison from Biden to the next Trump administration, if so.
[1:05:25.180 --> 1:05:29.180]  So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring into our bodies
[1:05:29.180 --> 1:05:33.180]  to change who we are are only lowering us.
[1:05:33.180 --> 1:05:34.180]  They're only making us more depressed.
[1:05:34.180 --> 1:05:37.180]  From the end, they're only making us less filled.
[1:05:37.180 --> 1:05:40.180]  It is only by going within and really making that connection to God
[1:05:40.180 --> 1:05:42.180]  that we can truly empower ourselves.
[1:05:42.180 --> 1:05:46.180]  That's why the globalist, bombardist, and toxins and chemicals
[1:05:46.180 --> 1:05:49.180]  to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements
[1:05:49.180 --> 1:05:55.180]  our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[1:05:55.180 --> 1:06:21.180]  And that's where the incredible products come in at infowarstore.com.
[1:06:21.180 --> 1:06:29.180]  If they can make you believe absurdities, they can make you commit atrocities.
[1:06:29.180 --> 1:06:32.180]  Voltaire famously said that.
[1:06:32.180 --> 1:06:33.180]  And that's what we're seeing, folks.
[1:06:33.180 --> 1:06:41.180]  If they can make you believe absurdities, men or women, being obese is healthy.
[1:06:41.180 --> 1:06:46.180]  Joe Biden is physically and mentally fit more so than Trump.
[1:06:46.180 --> 1:06:51.180]  I don't think we need to go any further down the line.
[1:06:51.180 --> 1:06:51.180]  I think we get the point here.
[1:06:51.180 --> 1:06:54.180]  Then they can make you commit atrocities.
[1:06:54.180 --> 1:06:55.180]  Oh, let's groom children.
[1:06:55.180 --> 1:07:00.180]  Let's chop little boys' balls off.
[1:07:00.180 --> 1:07:06.180]  So first they make you believe the absurdities, then you commit the atrocities.
[1:07:06.180 --> 1:07:11.180]  Oh, COVID-19 is the most deadly virus ever so deadly you don't even know you have it.
[1:07:11.180 --> 1:07:13.180]  That's the absurdity.
[1:07:13.180 --> 1:07:14.180]  What's the atrocity?
[1:07:14.180 --> 1:07:22.180]  Here, take this experimental injection that's killing people.
[1:07:22.180 --> 1:07:29.180]  If they can make you believe absurdities, they can make you commit atrocities.
[1:07:29.180 --> 1:07:35.180]  Let's look at some of the absurdities and atrocities that are going on here when it comes to the grooming of children.
[1:07:35.180 --> 1:07:46.180]  That's what this is, and so I could chalk it up to the fact that yesterday when I was covering this,
[1:07:46.180 --> 1:07:48.180]  I kind of went on an unhinged rant.
[1:07:48.180 --> 1:07:56.180]  I'll admit that, but I see adults grooming children and I don't tend to respond to that well,
[1:07:56.180 --> 1:08:01.180]  especially after staring at it all day for six hours hosting a talk show.
[1:08:01.180 --> 1:08:05.180]  As they say, staring at the abyss long enough, you become it.
[1:08:05.180 --> 1:08:10.180]  But I guess that's my problem is I don't like kids being sexually groomed by perverts.
[1:08:10.180 --> 1:08:12.180]  So I guess that's my problem.
[1:08:12.180 --> 1:08:16.180]  I guess I'm the person with the problem because I don't like to see young children,
[1:08:16.180 --> 1:08:22.180]  including prepubescent children, being taught how to be sexual deviants and perverts.
[1:08:22.180 --> 1:08:24.180]  I guess that's my shortcoming.
[1:08:24.180 --> 1:08:28.180]  I should be proud that we're grooming children to be sexual deviants.
[1:08:28.180 --> 1:08:31.180]  We should be celebrating this.
[1:08:31.180 --> 1:08:42.180]  So I should be happy that the BBC promotes 15-year-old drag queen who performs at private functions like a stripper.
[1:08:42.180 --> 1:08:48.180]  The BBC has promoted a 15-year-old teenage drag queen, Cherry West,
[1:08:48.180 --> 1:08:54.180]  who performs at private functions and LGBT Pride events.
[1:08:54.180 --> 1:09:01.180]  Sam Carlin, 15, started performing as Cherry West when he was 13
[1:09:01.180 --> 1:09:11.180]  after being introduced to his current passion as the BBC describes it on a family holiday in Lanza Road when he was 10.
[1:09:11.180 --> 1:09:19.180]  We just stumbled upon this drag bar and thought this is going to be a laugh, said Carlin's dad, also called Sam.
[1:09:19.180 --> 1:09:28.180]  So we went in and had a great time, although I got taken up on stage and I got dressed up into a drag queen.
[1:09:28.180 --> 1:09:30.180]  Sam thought it was funny.
[1:09:30.180 --> 1:09:32.180]  I was very embarrassed.
[1:09:32.180 --> 1:09:35.180]  Both his parents are supported of his drag career.
[1:09:35.180 --> 1:09:38.180]  Oh, well, the parents love it.
[1:09:38.180 --> 1:09:39.180]  They're getting all this attention.
[1:09:39.180 --> 1:09:40.180]  They're getting praise.
[1:09:40.180 --> 1:09:41.180]  They're getting celebrated.
[1:09:41.180 --> 1:09:43.180]  And I guess they're getting paid.
[1:09:43.180 --> 1:09:50.180]  And quite frankly, that's why you see a lot of these deranged lunatics promoting their kids to be gay
[1:09:50.180 --> 1:09:54.180]  or dressing them up if they're a girl as a boy or a boy as a girl and promoting it on social media
[1:09:54.180 --> 1:09:58.180]  because they realize there's actual and economic opportunity there for them.
[1:09:58.180 --> 1:10:00.180]  They use their children for profit.
[1:10:00.180 --> 1:10:08.180]  So it's a whole nother level of derangement, a whole nother level of mental depravity that the left is engaged in.
[1:10:08.180 --> 1:10:12.180]  15-year-old drag queen who gets paid to perform at functions.
[1:10:12.180 --> 1:10:19.180]  I mean, folks, you're one click away from being a 15-year-old stripper whore.
[1:10:19.180 --> 1:10:23.180]  And we celebrate this.
[1:10:23.180 --> 1:10:26.180]  It's just, it's just whacked out, man.
[1:10:26.180 --> 1:10:31.180]  It is just so whacked out.
[1:10:31.180 --> 1:10:33.180]  And, you know, here's the thing.
[1:10:33.180 --> 1:10:38.180]  We kind of reached, I mean, if you're a social liberal, I would consider myself a social liberal.
[1:10:38.180 --> 1:10:44.180]  I know a lot of conservatives don't really like social liberal conservatives.
[1:10:44.180 --> 1:10:51.180]  But hey, there's room for disagreement and debate and discourse and not everybody thinking the same.
[1:10:51.180 --> 1:10:54.180]  I never grew up with any of this crap.
[1:10:54.180 --> 1:11:01.180]  I never grew up with gay pride parades and tranny time and drag queen time and all this other BS
[1:11:01.180 --> 1:11:05.180]  that they're showing kids before they can even hit puberty.
[1:11:05.180 --> 1:11:07.180]  And guess what?
[1:11:07.180 --> 1:11:13.180]  By the time I was in high school, I had plenty of gay friends, boys and girls,
[1:11:13.180 --> 1:11:18.180]  and, you know, they knew they were gay and they knew what they were into and it wasn't a big deal.
[1:11:18.180 --> 1:11:23.180]  They didn't need to rub it in your face and you didn't really care and it was just live and let live.
[1:11:23.180 --> 1:11:28.180]  And so this whole notion like, oh, we have to do this.
[1:11:28.180 --> 1:11:32.180]  We have to do this for the gay kids and the trans kids and all this other garbage.
[1:11:32.180 --> 1:11:35.180]  No, you're not doing it for them.
[1:11:35.180 --> 1:11:37.180]  You're doing it for yourselves.
[1:11:37.180 --> 1:11:44.180]  You're doing it so you can groom these kids and then the question becomes why?
[1:11:44.180 --> 1:11:54.180]  Why are you so desperate to groom these kids into your sexual perversion unless you have a desire to rape them?
[1:11:54.180 --> 1:11:58.180]  It's an honest, it's a fair question.
[1:11:58.180 --> 1:12:05.180]  It needs to be asked. Maybe it will be pretty soon, right to their face.
[1:12:05.180 --> 1:12:16.180]  Why are you so interested in teaching these kids sexually perverted deviancies before they can hit puberty?
[1:12:16.180 --> 1:12:23.180]  Why are you so concerned with that unless you plan on engaging with them sexually at some point?
[1:12:23.180 --> 1:12:26.180]  That's what this is about.
[1:12:26.180 --> 1:12:29.180]  There's been gay people forever.
[1:12:29.180 --> 1:12:33.180]  If you want to make the argument they've been discriminated against in the past, fine.
[1:12:33.180 --> 1:12:39.180]  Not anymore, not the case.
[1:12:39.180 --> 1:12:46.180]  So it's gone from, we've reached kind of a good point if you're a social liberal where, hey, guess what?
[1:12:46.180 --> 1:12:49.180]  We're accepting of everybody, gay, straight, bi.
[1:12:49.180 --> 1:12:53.180]  You're an adult that wants to cross-dress, fine, whatever.
[1:12:53.180 --> 1:12:57.180]  So now, no, we have to teach the kids how to do this.
[1:12:57.180 --> 1:12:59.180]  We have to indoctrinate the kids.
[1:12:59.180 --> 1:13:04.180]  And the excuse is, well, we don't want them to feel left out or discriminated against or all this stuff.
[1:13:04.180 --> 1:13:08.180]  Bull crap.
[1:13:08.180 --> 1:13:11.180]  Bull crap.
[1:13:11.180 --> 1:13:14.180]  It has everything to do with you grooming them sexually.
[1:13:14.180 --> 1:13:21.180]  It has nothing to do with making sure gay people feel comfortable.
[1:13:21.180 --> 1:13:23.180]  Oh, are there gay kids that get bullied?
[1:13:23.180 --> 1:13:26.180]  Sure, there's all kinds of kids that get bullied.
[1:13:26.180 --> 1:13:29.180]  Bullying happens.
[1:13:29.180 --> 1:13:33.180]  This is sexual grooming, folks.
[1:13:33.180 --> 1:13:43.180]  Illinois education standards say grades K through 2 should learn about gender identity and gender stereotypes.
[1:13:43.180 --> 1:13:51.180]  Grades 3 to 5 learn about masturbation, puberty blockers, and trans children, literal grooming, homeschool your kids.
[1:13:51.180 --> 1:13:58.180]  Trans kids don't exist until a pervert gets their hands on them.
[1:13:58.180 --> 1:14:01.180]  That's the response.
[1:14:01.180 --> 1:14:05.180]  Trans kids don't exist until a pervert gets their hands on them.
[1:14:05.180 --> 1:14:11.180]  And they have all the documents here with the images where they're teaching these little kids how to have gay sex and use sex toys
[1:14:11.180 --> 1:14:17.180]  to mutilate their genitals, masturbate.
[1:14:17.180 --> 1:14:20.180]  Oh, my gosh, man.
[1:14:20.180 --> 1:14:29.180]  You know, I prayed on this last night and I really focused myself just to refocus myself to not blow up on air like I did last night covering this stuff.
[1:14:29.180 --> 1:14:37.180]  I mean, folks, you understand, they're giving this stuff to children.
[1:14:37.180 --> 1:14:50.180]  And it's like, oh, my gosh.
[1:14:50.180 --> 1:14:55.180]  So all the documents are here. It's on the lips for TikTok.
[1:14:55.180 --> 1:15:06.180]  And it's just, they just want, they just want to be, it's kind of like when it's like the first thing a child sees,
[1:15:06.180 --> 1:15:11.180]  it recognizes as the mother and it forms that attachment, that bond.
[1:15:11.180 --> 1:15:25.180]  This is like you're being born sexually, but it's not the natural progress of going through puberty and maybe having your first kiss or, you know, experimenting or whatever.
[1:15:25.180 --> 1:15:33.180]  It's not through that organic natural process where you kind of learn things for yourself or, you know, you fall in love with a girl or something and you're like, wow, this is awesome.
[1:15:33.180 --> 1:15:42.180]  I love this connection. I love this feeling. It's no, we're here as drag queens and gay liberals and we're going to be the mother of that process.
[1:15:42.180 --> 1:15:50.180]  So your kid's going to be gay and we're going to show your kids the different kind of anal sex toys and lube and ways to masturbate and play with themselves.
[1:15:50.180 --> 1:15:58.180]  And just like a newborn baby attaches to their mother, these kids then attach their sexuality to these perverts.
[1:15:58.180 --> 1:16:15.180]  You know, it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true that Info Wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty, as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[1:16:15.180 --> 1:16:22.180]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[1:16:22.180 --> 1:16:32.180]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at InfoWarsTour.com and we are funded by listeners and viewers like you.
[1:16:32.180 --> 1:16:40.180]  And so now we need to support more than ever because this fight has intensified. Don't need me to tell you that at InfoWarsTour.com.
[1:16:40.180 --> 1:16:44.180]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[1:16:44.180 --> 1:16:53.180]  Things have been sold out for a long time like InfoWars Life, Fizzy Magnesium mix that's so amazing, and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[1:16:53.180 --> 1:16:58.180]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at InfoWarsTour.com right now.
[1:16:58.180 --> 1:17:11.180]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans. They financed major universities, they ran full-page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda of New York Times and their major newspapers.
[1:17:11.180 --> 1:17:16.180]  That the family as we know it is a bad thing and must be ended.
[1:17:16.180 --> 1:17:25.180]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[1:17:25.180 --> 1:17:30.180]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four-national daughter.
[1:17:30.180 --> 1:17:34.180]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well. I love to make breakfast.
[1:17:34.180 --> 1:17:43.180]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurturatives and then all sit down together and have the communal event.
[1:17:43.180 --> 1:17:49.180]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions that come in together.
[1:17:49.180 --> 1:17:58.180]  They really are a sick, evil, scientific cult of filth and domesticate us and turn us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue.
[1:17:58.180 --> 1:18:16.180]  If I had to describe with just one word, the grainwashing, the mind control, the asleep prince that the general public is in, the best word would actually be the people are lost.
[1:18:16.180 --> 1:18:30.180]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're in a car or you get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused, you have a concussion.
[1:18:30.180 --> 1:18:37.180]  And that's what the globalists have done. They have stunned us. They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings.
[1:18:37.180 --> 1:18:43.180]  And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave a speech he called The Great New Narrative, where he brags how the public is lost.
[1:18:43.180 --> 1:18:51.180]  How the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[1:18:51.180 --> 1:18:54.180]  That's what the Great Reset is. They need darkness to thrive.
[1:18:54.180 --> 1:19:17.180]  The White Lives at NFOwars.com.
[1:19:24.180 --> 1:19:31.180]  GCN is under attack. Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not want you to know the truth.

[1:20:00.180 --> 1:20:29.180]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:29.180 --> 1:20:36.180]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones show brought to you by infowarsstore.com.
[1:20:36.180 --> 1:20:47.180]  Folks, I'm telling you, the immune support formula that we have just launched at infowarsstore.com, we're just, we're so happy about this.
[1:20:47.180 --> 1:21:01.180]  Especially with everything that's gone down in the last two years plus and people are starting to think about their immune system and rethinking the way they prepare for getting sick or getting a virus or a cough or anything.
[1:21:01.180 --> 1:21:05.180]  And they're thinking about their immune system.
[1:21:05.180 --> 1:21:18.180]  Now, Dr. Death Fauci and the rest of these corrupt scumbags in the health sector of our federal government, they're not going to tell you about your immune system. They're not going to tell you about exercise and all that stuff.
[1:21:18.180 --> 1:21:26.180]  But we will and we'll provide options for you to help build your immune system.
[1:21:26.180 --> 1:21:36.180]  All the supplements at infowarsstore.com have something involved or something in their ingredients that's going to be good for your immune system.
[1:21:36.180 --> 1:21:44.180]  But now we have the product that is just fully 100% dedicated to building your immune system with known ingredients that are all natural and organic.
[1:21:44.180 --> 1:21:59.180]  It's known to give you immune support. It's the immune support, liquid tincture, proprietary natural formula with the ingredients, elderberry, Augustifolia root, Lomathium root, Astragulus root, Angelica root, and so much more.
[1:21:59.180 --> 1:22:04.180]  Just all natural stuff known good for your immune system.
[1:22:04.180 --> 1:22:10.180]  And we're just so excited that this is going on now.
[1:22:10.180 --> 1:22:18.180]  In fact, what is that crew? What do you want? You want to see it? Is that what you're requesting right now?
[1:22:18.180 --> 1:22:32.180]  The crew wants to see the droplets on the paper that I have in front of me. So let me just open this one right here so that you can see this.
[1:22:32.180 --> 1:22:43.180]  And it's basically a whole dropper every day, but here it is right here.
[1:22:43.180 --> 1:22:51.180]  And you can see the coloring there. These are just all natural things from nature that build your immune system.
[1:22:51.180 --> 1:22:58.180]  And you can see pretty thick there, too. These droplets holding their shape, if you will.
[1:22:58.180 --> 1:23:07.180]  But there you go. That's the elderberry, that's the astragulus root, that's the natural ingredients from the immune support formula.
[1:23:07.180 --> 1:23:15.180]  High quality ingredients, high quality formula at infowarstore.com to build your immune system. We're proud of it.
[1:23:15.180 --> 1:23:27.180]  And it's just the key with everything else. The vitamin D3 gummies, the vitamin C plus zinc, the vaso beat complete, the fizzy magnesium, the vitamin mineral fusion, all of it is good for immune system.
[1:23:27.180 --> 1:23:37.180]  But this one is just strictly dedicated to it. And it is at an introductory sale rate right now of 25% off.
[1:23:37.180 --> 1:23:51.180]  Part of our info wars emergency blowout sale happening now where it's basically, I mean, we're not, it's not a going out of business sale because we don't plan on going out of business.
[1:23:51.180 --> 1:24:08.180]  But, you know, it's like they're trying to put us out of business and we want to survive. So we just got to sell everything out as quickly as possible to pay some bills to just extend our life a couple months here and then, you know, reformulate things to see how we're going to fund ourselves for the next month.
[1:24:08.180 --> 1:24:17.180]  Hell, if we had big donors like George Soros, the big billionaire donors that just flushed us with millions and millions of dollars, we wouldn't have to worry about it.
[1:24:17.180 --> 1:24:26.180]  But that's not how we operate around here. We don't have big corporate sponsors. We just have you, the audience. That's it.
[1:24:26.180 --> 1:24:32.180]  And we have been able to bring on a couple sponsors, but we sell our own proprietary products and info wars store.com. And that's what keeps us on the air.
[1:24:32.180 --> 1:24:39.180]  And it's your support there as well that makes it all possible. All right.
[1:24:39.180 --> 1:24:53.180]  You know, we do care about your health, unlike apparently the mainstream media. And here's the thing. I don't I don't really get involved in people's personal business.
[1:24:53.180 --> 1:25:02.180]  As far as I mean, maybe if I had a friend that I saw was really getting unhealthy or out of shape or something, I would say something.
[1:25:02.180 --> 1:25:14.180]  But I mean, for the most part, it's your own body. It's your own life. But see, what we do here at info wars is we just counter all of the propaganda media with the truth.
[1:25:14.180 --> 1:25:23.180]  So I'm not on here to attack people that are obese or out of shape, but it's an unhealthy way to live.
[1:25:23.180 --> 1:25:40.180]  And you'll be much happier when you're when you're a healthier person. And so when they have these new shows that are just dedicated to fat people and promoting it as a good thing, it's really just kind of disgusting.
[1:25:40.180 --> 1:25:49.180]  Again, I don't really care if you're fat and you can use that as a personality trait. And that's all fine and dandy. But let's not act like this is a health thing.
[1:25:49.180 --> 1:25:59.180]  Let's not act like you don't have a serious health problem. And here's the funny thing. So they're showing this trailer for this new show called big girls.
[1:25:59.180 --> 1:26:08.180]  And it's just obese women. Probably you have to be 300 pounds to even get a role. It's like the first thing they do is put you on a scale and see if you're way as much as a hippo.
[1:26:08.180 --> 1:26:19.180]  And then you get the part if you're, you know, over 300 pounds or whatever. And I mean, it's just, it's just all this, it's just all this filth and disgust.
[1:26:19.180 --> 1:26:27.180]  And it's all this propaganda. Let me explain something. You could go back in time. Probably not even that long ago.
[1:26:27.180 --> 1:26:44.180]  But what 50 years, maybe you could go back in time and you would never even see a woman that big. You would never even see a human being that big.
[1:26:44.180 --> 1:26:59.180]  So there's something going on here, folks, that needs to be talked about. And again, I won't go after these women or attack them. They're out of shape.
[1:26:59.180 --> 1:27:09.180]  If they want to be unhealthy or whatever, that's their own thing. I'm never going to promote an unhealthy lifestyle and I'm going to counter the propaganda media telling you that it's healthy to be obese.
[1:27:09.180 --> 1:27:23.180]  That's a lie. But why is it, I mean, I don't have a chart in front of me, but you can probably look at the average weight of a female or a male in America.
[1:27:23.180 --> 1:27:31.180]  But in fact, I see if you can pull something up like see if there's a line graph or something or some statistics about the average weight of a female or a male.
[1:27:31.180 --> 1:27:41.180]  And I guarantee you that number has gone up in the last 50 years. There's something there. And there's obvious, there's obvious there.
[1:27:41.180 --> 1:27:51.180]  There's like, okay, the food that is unhealthy that they eat and it's the chemicals in the food. But it's more than that.
[1:27:51.180 --> 1:28:08.180]  It's the propaganda as well. And it's this new embracing the lifestyle of laziness and saying, oh, I'm lazy. I'm fat. That's empowering.
[1:28:08.180 --> 1:28:17.180]  And then that just becomes an excuse to live an extremely unhealthy lifestyle. And the media says, hey, don't worry about that. You're good. You're great.
[1:28:17.180 --> 1:28:25.180]  You look like a beached whale. It's okay. And it's not.
[1:28:25.180 --> 1:28:37.180]  But it is the food, folks. It is the seed oils. It is the processed sugar. It is the fast food. It is the soda.
[1:28:37.180 --> 1:28:47.180]  And for a nation that apparently cares so much about health, post pandemic, they really don't seem to care. Yeah, there you go. America is fatter than ever.
[1:28:47.180 --> 1:28:59.180]  Just in the last 20 years, body weight has gone up 10% in men and 5% in women. Folks, that is that is huge. No pun intended.
[1:28:59.180 --> 1:29:08.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help. I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong. I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[1:29:08.180 --> 1:29:20.180]  I was born for this. You were born for this. And people are really waking up right now. But we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[1:29:20.180 --> 1:29:31.180]  And now, with Band-Aid video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[1:29:31.180 --> 1:29:42.180]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22. Info wars and Band-Aid video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide.
[1:29:42.180 --> 1:29:52.180]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month. So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now.
[1:29:52.180 --> 1:29:58.180]  The mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off, getting credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever.
[1:29:58.180 --> 1:30:15.180]  You know, it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty, as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[1:30:15.180 --> 1:30:29.180]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done. So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at info wars tour.com.
[1:30:29.180 --> 1:30:37.180]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you. And so now we need to support more than ever because this fight has intensified.
[1:30:37.180 --> 1:30:45.180]  Don't need me to tell you that at info wars tour.com. We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[1:30:45.180 --> 1:30:54.180]  Things have been sold out for a long time like info wars life, fizzy magnesium mix that's so amazing, and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[1:30:54.180 --> 1:30:59.180]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at info wars tour.com right now.
[1:30:59.180 --> 1:31:10.180]  This is even noted by many a historian. The first casualty of war is the truth. Then the next big casualty isn't even the people that die.
[1:31:10.180 --> 1:31:20.180]  No, that invariably follows. But first there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and massive censorship.
[1:31:20.180 --> 1:31:37.180]  And now across the world from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced that if you amplify any quote pro Russian information, you can be censored, you can be arrested, you can be imprisoned.
[1:31:37.180 --> 1:31:49.180]  And of course now Canada is under this legislation that if you have a fought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online that you will be censored and arrested.
[1:31:49.180 --> 1:31:58.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes info wars.com more important than ever.
[1:32:20.180 --> 1:32:31.180]  Because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down. Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in the woods and just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the land?
[1:32:31.180 --> 1:32:38.180]  That's the survival instinct. But see the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says no, no, no, no, stay in the city.
[1:32:38.180 --> 1:32:43.180]  The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere they've ever noticed that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[1:32:43.180 --> 1:32:50.180]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[1:32:50.180 --> 1:33:14.180]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies. And so we have the best ones at infowarstore.com.
[1:33:21.180 --> 1:33:32.180]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones. And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:33:32.180 --> 1:33:41.180]  I'm told here during the break that the Biden administration is considering giving out $300 gas stimulus checks.
[1:33:41.180 --> 1:33:46.180]  I don't know what the official term was. I thought it was something being proposed in California.
[1:33:46.180 --> 1:33:55.180]  But apparently it may be a Biden thing. Here's the story this morning from the Gateway Pundit Democrats refuse new oil production projects.
[1:33:55.180 --> 1:34:02.180]  Call for $300 a month checks to help Americans pay for record Biden gas prices. Oh my gosh.
[1:34:02.180 --> 1:34:12.180]  So that's just going to add to the inflation. That's just going to add to the inflation. And it's really not going to help anybody at all.
[1:34:12.180 --> 1:34:17.180]  Guys, put that story back up on screen for me, please.
[1:34:17.180 --> 1:34:25.180]  So you're just going to get $300 a month to pay for gas now.
[1:34:25.180 --> 1:34:37.180]  Oh my gosh. This administration is a clown show, man. This is just a clown show.
[1:34:37.180 --> 1:34:45.180]  You know, if you want Americans to have more money in their pockets and more money in their bank accounts, here's an idea.
[1:34:45.180 --> 1:34:50.180]  Why don't you cut taxes, you bastards?
[1:34:50.180 --> 1:34:54.180]  You see now I'm starting to the bloodiest in the boil, folks.
[1:34:54.180 --> 1:35:00.180]  You know how I hate taxes. Who likes taxes?
[1:35:00.180 --> 1:35:08.180]  What the, what the, I mean, I just, that's the kind of thing that just knocks you off kilter.
[1:35:08.180 --> 1:35:16.180]  It's so clown worldish. Please just cut taxes. No, no, no, no, no, because they got to give themselves a raise.
[1:35:16.180 --> 1:35:24.180]  They still got to get their, they still got to get their money on their congressional budgets, which is, which is now.
[1:35:24.180 --> 1:35:32.180]  I mean, I'm almost to a point where I'd say that you should not even get paid to work in Congress.
[1:35:32.180 --> 1:35:39.180]  Or you should, you should not, I mean, $200,000 to be a member of Congress is way too much.
[1:35:39.180 --> 1:35:47.180]  It should be a job of passion. It should be a job of service.
[1:35:47.180 --> 1:35:53.180]  Most people in America aren't making $200,000 a year. They're not.
[1:35:53.180 --> 1:35:58.180]  Congressional, congressional salaries should be no more than $100,000 a year.
[1:35:58.180 --> 1:36:03.180]  Even that might be too much.
[1:36:03.180 --> 1:36:10.180]  I mean, maybe if we quit spending all this money in foreign countries that don't help us at all, then maybe we could give Congress a bonus.
[1:36:10.180 --> 1:36:18.180]  But 300 bucks for an American to buy gas every month. I mean, this is just insulting.
[1:36:18.180 --> 1:36:25.180]  This is, this is clown world level stuff now that we're dealing with.
[1:36:25.180 --> 1:36:30.180]  So we'll see if that passes and it won't even matter.
[1:36:30.180 --> 1:36:37.180]  You'll get $300 a month for gasoline. That'll add another 3% to the inflation rate.
[1:36:37.180 --> 1:36:43.180]  It's not going to solve the problem of the supply chain shortages and the, and the energy shortages.
[1:36:43.180 --> 1:36:51.180]  I mean, they can't be serious, but they are.
[1:36:51.180 --> 1:36:54.180]  Oh, they are. All right.
[1:36:54.180 --> 1:37:01.180]  Since we're talking about that, let's get into some of this other political news here.
[1:37:01.180 --> 1:37:08.180]  So we covered this yesterday and we play the clip, but it's imperative that people understand what's being proposed right now.
[1:37:08.180 --> 1:37:14.180]  Companies brace for higher compliance costs as SEC proposes climate disclosure.
[1:37:14.180 --> 1:37:16.180]  So, so what are they going to do?
[1:37:16.180 --> 1:37:25.180]  So now you're going to be forced to pay climate taxes and carbon taxes, which if you think the price at the pump,
[1:37:25.180 --> 1:37:31.180]  let's say, I guess the Biden administration figures the average American is paying $300 more at the pump right now.
[1:37:31.180 --> 1:37:34.180]  So they're going to mitigate that by giving you $300.
[1:37:34.180 --> 1:37:40.180]  Here's an idea. Cut all the gas taxes. Cut, cut taxes on the gas and oil companies, maybe the lower prices.
[1:37:40.180 --> 1:37:45.180]  No, we can't do that. Let's add to the inflation. Let's become full blown communists.
[1:37:45.180 --> 1:37:54.180]  You think that the gas prices going up is devastating people, which, OK, $300 a month, that, that, that'll hurt people.
[1:37:54.180 --> 1:37:58.180]  That can hurt people if you're, if you're spending that on gas and you're on a tight budget.
[1:37:58.180 --> 1:38:04.180]  But for most people, it won't completely devastate them.
[1:38:04.180 --> 1:38:13.180]  The proposed carbon taxes will be a devastation level economic policy.
[1:38:13.180 --> 1:38:16.180]  But what are they going to do?
[1:38:16.180 --> 1:38:23.180]  Oh, you're paying more in your carbon tax now, but you can't afford it.
[1:38:23.180 --> 1:38:28.180]  Are they going to cut you a check to pay for your carbon tax now, too?
[1:38:28.180 --> 1:38:33.180]  It's the same difference.
[1:38:33.180 --> 1:38:40.180]  Oh, I can't, I'm getting crushed by carbon taxes. OK, here's a stimulus check to pay for your carbon taxes.
[1:38:40.180 --> 1:38:46.180]  And of course, see, this, this is where, where you really get down to the root cause of so many problems.
[1:38:46.180 --> 1:38:52.180]  And this is why they want the great reset, folks, because it's only a matter of time
[1:38:52.180 --> 1:39:02.180]  before people start asking the real questions like, if you can just print money out of thin air, why am I paying taxes?
[1:39:02.180 --> 1:39:07.180]  See, see that? Because that's what they do.
[1:39:07.180 --> 1:39:13.180]  If the government can print money out of thin air, why am I paying taxes?
[1:39:13.180 --> 1:39:19.180]  It's because you're a slave.
[1:39:19.180 --> 1:39:29.180]  And that's the kind of awakening process that this country needs to have that shouldn't be political, shouldn't be across party lines.
[1:39:29.180 --> 1:39:37.180]  But it's so heavy and overbearing, you don't even want to bear the burden of dealing with it and accepting that you have a fiat currency
[1:39:37.180 --> 1:39:45.180]  that you've been lied to about it and that your government treats you like a slave, forcing you to pay the tax man
[1:39:45.180 --> 1:39:51.180]  when they just print money at will, whenever the hell they feel like it, and give it to foreign countries 24-7,
[1:39:51.180 --> 1:40:01.180]  most of that money gets laundered back into politicians' pockets and, or their cronies that they have no bid contracts with.
[1:40:01.180 --> 1:40:03.180]  But let me get back to the point.
[1:40:03.180 --> 1:40:08.180]  So they can't get their green new deal passed.
[1:40:08.180 --> 1:40:12.180]  They can't sell the American people that you need to pay just, just to live.
[1:40:12.180 --> 1:40:17.180]  It's not really a good public policy, and it's not really something they can legislate.
[1:40:17.180 --> 1:40:26.180]  So they're going to do the end-around, and they're going to use the Securities and Exchange Commission to bring in carbon taxes
[1:40:26.180 --> 1:40:30.180]  without a single vote, without a single legislation or law passed.
[1:40:30.180 --> 1:40:35.180]  It's just going to be, oh, we're just doing this now.
[1:40:35.180 --> 1:40:42.180]  And then you'll have the monitors on your vehicles, you'll have the monitors on your house.
[1:40:42.180 --> 1:40:46.180]  They've already installed them in most places.
[1:40:46.180 --> 1:40:52.180]  So you may see your energy bill go up with the inflation and the energy crisis.
[1:40:52.180 --> 1:41:02.180]  So maybe the cost to heat or cool your home went from 200 bucks a month to 250 bucks a month.
[1:41:02.180 --> 1:41:05.180]  Well, then you're going to get hit with that carbon tax.
[1:41:05.180 --> 1:41:15.180]  And then you're going to probably pay 25% of that in a carbon tax, and so really your energy bill just went to $300 a month.
[1:41:15.180 --> 1:41:19.180]  But that's just on an individual basis.
[1:41:19.180 --> 1:41:22.180]  They're going to add carbon taxes for driving a vehicle.
[1:41:22.180 --> 1:41:29.180]  If you're a business and you deliver goods or services,
[1:41:29.180 --> 1:41:33.180]  or you actually have a building that needs heating and cooling,
[1:41:33.180 --> 1:41:37.180]  you're going to be paying massive dollar amounts in carbon taxes.
[1:41:37.180 --> 1:41:42.180]  And the whole goal here has nothing to do with stopping climate change.
[1:41:42.180 --> 1:41:45.180]  You could print $10 trillion tomorrow.
[1:41:45.180 --> 1:41:51.180]  You could print a $10 trillion bill tomorrow and say,
[1:41:51.180 --> 1:41:56.180]  I'm giving this to the climate change cause, and not a damn thing would change.
[1:41:56.180 --> 1:42:09.180]  And any green energy solutions would all have to be built on the back of coal or fossil fuels or natural gas, just like everything else.
[1:42:09.180 --> 1:42:13.180]  So it would never work anyway.
[1:42:13.180 --> 1:42:20.180]  But that's the apparent logic here is, oh, money will solve climate change.
[1:42:20.180 --> 1:42:26.180]  So you pay more, you become even more of a slave, you lose even more prosperity and freedom in the free market.
[1:42:26.180 --> 1:42:29.180]  The government gets more money to do what?
[1:42:29.180 --> 1:42:33.180]  Give to their friends, give to themselves in the name of fighting climate change.
[1:42:33.180 --> 1:42:35.180]  But see, here's the catch.
[1:42:35.180 --> 1:42:38.180]  All the major corporations will be exempt.
[1:42:38.180 --> 1:42:40.180]  Google will be exempt.
[1:42:40.180 --> 1:42:41.180]  Meta will be exempt.
[1:42:41.180 --> 1:42:43.180]  All the big corporations will be exempt.
[1:42:43.180 --> 1:42:47.180]  They're going to crush the small businesses and they're going to crush the individual.
[1:42:47.180 --> 1:42:52.180]  And then the hope is that eventually everybody's going to work for Google or Facebook or Amazon.
[1:42:52.180 --> 1:43:18.180]  And that's the only way to avoid getting crushed by the system.
[1:43:22.180 --> 1:43:24.180]  Let me tell you what is in this amazing product.
[1:43:24.180 --> 1:43:33.180]  Concentrated elderberry, concentrated echinacea, concentrated astragalus root, angelica root, loatium root, and more.
[1:43:33.180 --> 1:43:35.180]  This product is incredible.
[1:43:35.180 --> 1:43:43.180]  InfoWars immune support, exclusively available at infowarsstore.com, is funding the tip of the spear, the InfoWars operation.
[1:43:43.180 --> 1:43:44.180]  It is a 360 win.
[1:43:44.180 --> 1:43:51.180]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's natural defenses and keep InfoWars on the air.
[1:43:51.180 --> 1:43:53.180]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[1:43:53.180 --> 1:44:22.180]  Take action now at infowarsstore.com.
[1:44:23.180 --> 1:44:52.180]  This product is available at infowarsstore.com.
[1:44:53.180 --> 1:45:12.180]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[1:45:12.180 --> 1:45:20.180]  From the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[1:45:20.180 --> 1:45:22.180]  That's why they launched their great recess.
[1:45:22.180 --> 1:45:27.180]  And they're programing for collapsing us of Build Back Better.
[1:45:27.180 --> 1:45:33.180]  This is nothing more than a top-down, vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[1:45:33.180 --> 1:45:41.180]  And because they couldn't take our guns, and because we wouldn't bow, because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win.
[1:45:41.180 --> 1:45:44.180]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[1:45:44.180 --> 1:45:48.180]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[1:45:48.180 --> 1:45:52.180]  Except simple, they can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns.
[1:45:52.180 --> 1:45:56.180]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19, and you know the rest is history.
[1:45:56.180 --> 1:46:19.180]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[1:46:19.180 --> 1:46:21.180]  Brother, I'm so glad you called elaborate on this.
[1:46:21.180 --> 1:46:30.180]  Yes, now is the time in your small town, or your big city, to write something on the bathroom wall, or to put a sticker on your car, or banner hangs over highways.
[1:46:30.180 --> 1:46:32.180]  And it will be a chain reaction.
[1:46:32.180 --> 1:46:34.180]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[1:46:34.180 --> 1:46:35.180]  I have a few ideas.
[1:46:35.180 --> 1:46:40.180]  First of all, after the COVID-19 bomb, arrest out, arrest out, swap.
[1:46:40.180 --> 1:46:41.180]  The vaccine is poison.
[1:46:41.180 --> 1:46:42.180]  There's tons of things.
[1:46:42.180 --> 1:46:43.180]  I say just keep it short, keep it concise.
[1:46:43.180 --> 1:46:44.180]  I agree.
[1:46:44.180 --> 1:46:46.180]  Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates.
[1:46:46.180 --> 1:46:48.180]  The COVID-19 vaccine is poison.
[1:46:48.180 --> 1:46:49.180]  Beautiful.
[1:46:49.180 --> 1:46:51.180]  The way that we can all be involved is that we can all be affected.
[1:46:51.180 --> 1:46:53.180]  So that's what I'm calling about.
[1:46:53.180 --> 1:46:54.180]  God bless you, Chris.
[1:46:54.180 --> 1:46:57.180]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[1:46:57.180 --> 1:46:58.180]  Thank you so much.
[1:47:00.180 --> 1:47:07.180]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:07.180 --> 1:47:25.180]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I got to tell you, and again, I prayed on this last
[1:47:25.180 --> 1:47:29.180]  night and I'm going to do a good job of not losing my temper here today.
[1:47:29.180 --> 1:47:31.180]  It's my one fault.
[1:47:31.180 --> 1:47:35.180]  If I have any here as a talk show host, probably my biggest is just losing my temper.
[1:47:35.180 --> 1:47:40.180]  But, you know, I don't like the fact that they're grooming children to be pedophiles
[1:47:40.180 --> 1:47:42.180]  and sexual deviants.
[1:47:42.180 --> 1:47:49.180]  And I don't like that the Biden administration is currently actively destroying my country,
[1:47:49.180 --> 1:47:54.180]  my livelihood, my future, my destiny.
[1:47:54.180 --> 1:47:59.180]  So, I mean, I just have to accept it as just a matter of fact, I guess.
[1:47:59.180 --> 1:48:02.180]  But there's something in you that says, no, you can do something about this.
[1:48:02.180 --> 1:48:06.180]  Maybe it's a fool's hope or a fool's errand.
[1:48:06.180 --> 1:48:09.180]  But it's like, it's just every break I'm just sitting here.
[1:48:09.180 --> 1:48:13.180]  It's just like Biden administration crushing America here, crushing America there, destroying
[1:48:13.180 --> 1:48:15.180]  our culture here and there.
[1:48:15.180 --> 1:48:21.180]  I mean, it's just, it's just, oh, we're getting bombarded from every freaking angle with these people.
[1:48:21.180 --> 1:48:23.180]  And it's not going anywhere.
[1:48:23.180 --> 1:48:26.180]  There's no leadership seeming to pop up to stop this here.
[1:48:26.180 --> 1:48:29.180]  And it's just like, info wars in this audience is on an island.
[1:48:29.180 --> 1:48:33.180]  Yeah, finally, some other people in media are getting a little more truthful and hardcore with it.
[1:48:33.180 --> 1:48:38.180]  But, man.
[1:48:38.180 --> 1:48:45.180]  Biden is speaking right now, live in Brussels, by the way.
[1:48:45.180 --> 1:48:52.180]  I'm just overwhelmed by the fact that we have a current administration that wants to crush our country.
[1:48:52.180 --> 1:48:55.180]  And, you know, it's like, just yesterday, Madeleine Albright dies.
[1:48:55.180 --> 1:48:59.180]  And it's like, oh, she's a legend. She's a hero. She's a damn demon.
[1:48:59.180 --> 1:49:03.180]  She's a damn war criminal.
[1:49:03.180 --> 1:49:06.180]  It's just, it's just total bizarro world.
[1:49:06.180 --> 1:49:12.180]  And then there's the instinct, knowing this is all going on.
[1:49:12.180 --> 1:49:22.180]  And you just have to forget about the fact that you need to start preparing for this country to collapse.
[1:49:22.180 --> 1:49:27.180]  So let's go live to Biden here, speaking in Brussels to NATO.
[1:49:27.180 --> 1:49:32.180]  Here is the poopy pants forgetful sleepy Joe Biden.
[1:49:32.180 --> 1:49:37.180]  I'd be very fortunate if I had that same man running against me.
[1:49:37.180 --> 1:49:43.180]  Thank you very very much.
[1:49:43.180 --> 1:49:45.180]  How long did he go, guys? 10 minutes?
[1:49:45.180 --> 1:49:48.180]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[1:49:48.180 --> 1:49:52.180]  Yeah, one final question, right? Hey, LeWay, hold on a second, please.
[1:49:52.180 --> 1:49:57.180]  I was supposed to be an hour ago at the European Union meeting.
[1:49:57.180 --> 1:49:59.180]  And to speak. No, I'm thanking you.
[1:49:59.180 --> 1:50:05.180]  So someone I haven't called on before. You. Who are you?
[1:50:05.180 --> 1:50:08.180]  I'm Christina. Thank you, sir.
[1:50:08.180 --> 1:50:10.180]  Sir, deterrence didn't work.
[1:50:10.180 --> 1:50:15.180]  What makes you think Vladimir Putin will alter course based on the action you've taken today?
[1:50:15.180 --> 1:50:23.180]  I guess I'm astray. Do you remember if you covered me from the very beginning, I did not say that, in fact, the sanctions would deter him.
[1:50:23.180 --> 1:50:27.180]  Sanctions never deter. You keep talking about that.
[1:50:27.180 --> 1:50:37.180]  Sanctions never deter the maintenance of sanctions, the maintenance of sanctions, the increasing the pain and the demonstration.
[1:50:37.180 --> 1:50:49.180]  That's why I asked for this NATO meeting today is to be sure that after a month we will sustain what we're doing, not just next month, the following month, but for the remainder of this entire year.
[1:50:49.180 --> 1:50:52.180]  That's what will stop him. Wow.
[1:50:52.180 --> 1:50:54.180]  The actions they will have an impact on making Russia change course.
[1:50:54.180 --> 1:50:55.180]  I'm going to translate that for you.
[1:50:55.180 --> 1:50:59.180]  That's not what I said. You're playing a game with me. I know. The answer is no.
[1:50:59.180 --> 1:51:06.180]  I think what happens is we have to demonstrate the purpose, the single most important thing is for us to stay unified.
[1:51:06.180 --> 1:51:16.180]  And the world continue to focus on what a brute this guy is and all the innocent people's lives are being lost and ruined and what's going on.
[1:51:16.180 --> 1:51:18.180]  That's the important thing.
[1:51:18.180 --> 1:51:30.180]  But look, if you're Putin and you think that Europe is going to crack in a month or six weeks or two months, they can take anything for another month.
[1:51:30.180 --> 1:51:37.180]  But we have to demonstrate the reason I asked for the meeting. We have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united.
[1:51:37.180 --> 1:51:41.180]  Thank you.
[1:51:41.180 --> 1:51:45.180]  All right. So Biden exiting stage left here.
[1:51:45.180 --> 1:51:47.180]  Guys, how long was he live?
[1:51:47.180 --> 1:51:50.180]  Because 10, 15 minutes.
[1:51:50.180 --> 1:51:52.180]  Okay, about 10, 15 minutes there.
[1:51:52.180 --> 1:51:56.180]  We just broke in at the final moment, obviously, as you saw with us.
[1:51:56.180 --> 1:52:00.180]  So I'm not sure the full speech, obviously, I didn't hear it.
[1:52:00.180 --> 1:52:04.180]  But what he just said at the end is a big statement.
[1:52:04.180 --> 1:52:10.180]  And then there's a big statement he made about what they plan on doing for the rest of the year.
[1:52:10.180 --> 1:52:14.180]  And then there is the statements he made about the sanctions.
[1:52:14.180 --> 1:52:25.180]  So you're going to have new video clips, compilations probably by the end of the day where it's going to be Biden originally saying how the sanctions are going to work and they're going to be tough.
[1:52:25.180 --> 1:52:29.180]  And then Saki saying the sanctions are going to deter Putin.
[1:52:29.180 --> 1:52:38.180]  And then the same day Biden reversing course and saying, no, the sanctions were never meant to stop Putin.
[1:52:38.180 --> 1:52:46.180]  But really what he just said is this is going to be a slow burn to starting a larger war with Russia is basically what he just said.
[1:52:46.180 --> 1:52:54.180]  Which to me means they've already decided in a timeline of events if they can have any control over it.
[1:52:54.180 --> 1:53:10.180]  They're going to up the, I would say they would probably move on from saber rattling to actually engaging in physical attacks or threatening physical attacks against Putin after the midterms.
[1:53:10.180 --> 1:53:21.180]  That's basically what Biden just said through my political translation of these political snakes is they're going to wait till after the midterms to make a real move against Putin.
[1:53:21.180 --> 1:53:29.180]  Because Putin is the perfect scapegoat for them and the collapse of our economy and the Biden flation and the supply chain and everything.
[1:53:29.180 --> 1:53:37.180]  They just blame Putin for everything so that when the midterms come along, they don't suffer a total defeat.
[1:53:37.180 --> 1:53:45.180]  And that's basically what Biden just admitted there probably unintentionally when he said, oh, for the rest of the year we have this plan.
[1:53:45.180 --> 1:53:59.180]  It's going to be a slow burn a slow build up to then once they have either a dead duck presidency or a dead duck Congress to then start doing radical things against Putin, which will be unpopular.
[1:53:59.180 --> 1:54:07.180]  But that's why they're going to wait till after the midterms to do it.
[1:54:07.180 --> 1:54:21.180]  But again, you'll they will people will find the clips of Joe Biden talking about how they're going to get tough with sanctions on Putin and how that's going to be effective.
[1:54:21.180 --> 1:54:25.180]  And now he says no, it's not.
[1:54:25.180 --> 1:54:45.180]  Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man. And because of the Biden flation, I mean, we have the numbers here from the Gateway Pundit story where states like California and Illinois are proposing giving you $300 a month to pay for gasoline.
[1:54:45.180 --> 1:54:48.180]  How about you just cut our taxes?
[1:54:48.180 --> 1:54:59.180]  The current average for gasoline is $4.23 for regular.
[1:54:59.180 --> 1:55:04.180]  A year ago, it was $2.87.
[1:55:04.180 --> 1:55:09.180]  And in fact, I believe they even have this broken down by.
[1:55:09.180 --> 1:55:19.180]  Some story that they had broken down. And basically the price for gas has doubled.
[1:55:19.180 --> 1:55:23.180]  Since Biden got into office.
[1:55:23.180 --> 1:55:29.180]  And I'm not sure where that story went on my desk, but that's OK.
[1:55:29.180 --> 1:55:34.180]  The price per gallon has doubled.
[1:55:34.180 --> 1:55:41.180]  Since Joe Biden has been in office here it is right here election day 2020.
[1:55:41.180 --> 1:55:48.180]  So that's November 2020 gas was $2 and 11 cents per gallon.
[1:55:48.180 --> 1:55:58.180]  As of March 12, just two weeks ago, gas was $4 and 34 cents a gallon.
[1:55:58.180 --> 1:56:05.180]  And gas has literally doubled since Biden got into office.
[1:56:05.180 --> 1:56:09.180]  Now, we shouldn't be surprised by this. That's part of their policy.
[1:56:09.180 --> 1:56:13.180]  That was always part of their plan, their foreign policy and their domestic policy.
[1:56:13.180 --> 1:56:17.180]  So it's this weird thing where they get to have their cake and eat it too,
[1:56:17.180 --> 1:56:22.180]  where they virtue signal to the far liberal left saying,
[1:56:22.180 --> 1:56:28.180]  we're going to stop oil production. We're going to stop all gas. We're going to kill fossil fuel use in America.
[1:56:28.180 --> 1:56:32.180]  Well, OK, everybody knows what that means. You're not going to be able to afford to drive a car.
[1:56:32.180 --> 1:56:36.180]  Price per gallon is going to hit record highs and energy prices are going to go up.
[1:56:36.180 --> 1:56:40.180]  Everybody knows that that's what's going to happen with your policy.
[1:56:40.180 --> 1:56:45.180]  And they just leave you to believe that, oh, it's worth it. You're saving the planet.
[1:56:45.180 --> 1:56:51.180]  But then they enact the policy and you see the results and you see the record high gas prices
[1:56:51.180 --> 1:56:55.180]  and you're paying more for energy and the prices are only going to keep going up.
[1:56:55.180 --> 1:56:59.180]  They're not going to go down anytime soon. They're just going to keep going up.
[1:56:59.180 --> 1:57:03.180]  And then they sit there and they say, oh, this isn't our fault.
[1:57:03.180 --> 1:57:08.180]  And we're going to help mitigate this, even though it's their official policy
[1:57:08.180 --> 1:57:18.180]  that they brag about and promote.
[1:57:18.180 --> 1:57:23.180]  How much longer do we have to live in this clown world?
[1:57:23.180 --> 1:57:28.180]  How much longer do we have to live in this nonsensical upside down world,
[1:57:28.180 --> 1:57:33.180]  this illogical world of lies?
[1:57:33.180 --> 1:57:37.180]  The Biden administration says they will completely annihilate fossil fuels.
[1:57:37.180 --> 1:57:42.180]  The Biden administration blames Putin for the rising price of gasoline.
[1:57:42.180 --> 1:57:48.180]  And the media and Congress is just so pathetic they just go along for the ride.
[1:58:12.180 --> 1:58:15.180]  In the face of the globalists making their main move.
[1:58:15.180 --> 1:58:18.180]  In full wars, it's paradoxical. It's more popular than ever.
[1:58:18.180 --> 1:58:21.180]  It has reached more people than ever despite the censorship.
[1:58:21.180 --> 1:58:24.180]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure
[1:58:24.180 --> 1:58:28.180]  and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of money.

[1:59:49.180 --> 2:00:13.180]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:13.180 --> 2:00:21.180]  I don't want to, how should I say this?
[2:00:21.180 --> 2:00:27.180]  As I'm sitting here covering all of this, a portion of my brain
[2:00:27.180 --> 2:00:33.180]  is constantly working in the background, thinking, strategizing.
[2:00:33.180 --> 2:00:39.180]  What are you doing preparing for this collapse right now?
[2:00:39.180 --> 2:00:43.180]  It's just full disclosure here, folks.
[2:00:43.180 --> 2:00:48.180]  I'm covering all this news and I'd like to be happy, go lucky
[2:00:48.180 --> 2:00:51.180]  and tell you everything is going to be great and we're going to get through this
[2:00:51.180 --> 2:00:53.180]  and I hope that's the case.
[2:00:53.180 --> 2:01:00.180]  As I'm covering all this stuff and the news is breaking,
[2:01:00.180 --> 2:01:06.180]  there's a portion of my brain, there's a percentage of my brain
[2:01:06.180 --> 2:01:12.180]  that's over here operating as I'm covering all this news
[2:01:12.180 --> 2:01:14.180]  and it's just how are you preparing?
[2:01:14.180 --> 2:01:15.180]  What are you doing?
[2:01:15.180 --> 2:01:17.180]  Are you ready for the collapse of the civilization?
[2:01:17.180 --> 2:01:19.180]  Are you ready for the collapse of America?
[2:01:19.180 --> 2:01:20.180]  Have you made the right measurements?
[2:01:20.180 --> 2:01:21.180]  Do you have what you need?
[2:01:21.180 --> 2:01:25.180]  Are you properly prepared?
[2:01:25.180 --> 2:01:33.180]  This is just more of, just understand, this is real stuff
[2:01:33.180 --> 2:01:38.180]  and if you're processing these same questions in your head,
[2:01:38.180 --> 2:01:48.180]  that is a normal response because if this wasn't a battle for free speech
[2:01:48.180 --> 2:01:53.180]  and for truth and for the future of America and the planet,
[2:01:53.180 --> 2:01:57.180]  we'd probably just shut this whole thing down and just say,
[2:01:57.180 --> 2:02:03.180]  okay, it's over, go get ready, go get right with God,
[2:02:03.180 --> 2:02:07.180]  go get right with your family and go prepare for the next Great Depression,
[2:02:07.180 --> 2:02:10.180]  go prepare for the collapse of civilization.
[2:02:10.180 --> 2:02:14.180]  Again, I'm not, I don't want that to happen.
[2:02:14.180 --> 2:02:23.180]  I hope it doesn't happen, but you'd be stupid if you're not thinking about that
[2:02:23.180 --> 2:02:27.180]  or making proper preparations for that.
[2:02:27.180 --> 2:02:33.180]  So, I mean, it's just a constant tick in the back of my head as I'm covering this,
[2:02:33.180 --> 2:02:43.180]  which we always have here because of the vampires sucking at our neck.
[2:02:43.180 --> 2:02:44.180]  It just sucks, doesn't it?
[2:02:44.180 --> 2:02:51.180]  It just, it just sucks to know that none of this is necessary.
[2:02:51.180 --> 2:02:54.180]  It just sucks to know that none of this has to be going on.
[2:02:54.180 --> 2:02:58.180]  It just sucks to know that we could still be a prosperous nation
[2:02:58.180 --> 2:03:01.180]  and we'll have our problems and we'll have our disagreements
[2:03:01.180 --> 2:03:03.180]  and we'll have our corruption, but you know what?
[2:03:03.180 --> 2:03:08.180]  For the most part, you'll be in control of your destiny
[2:03:08.180 --> 2:03:15.180]  and there's a bright future ahead, but no.
[2:03:15.180 --> 2:03:26.180]  No, we're living on a planet that is being dominated and occupied by demonic entities
[2:03:26.180 --> 2:03:35.180]  and corrupt individuals that are quite literally planning the collapse of civilization
[2:03:35.180 --> 2:03:45.180]  and they plan to ride it like a wave to a totalitarian system of control and a technotronic age
[2:03:45.180 --> 2:03:53.180]  over all the people that are left on this planet for the rest of this planet's existence.
[2:03:53.180 --> 2:03:55.180]  And that's what's so heartbreaking about it.
[2:03:55.180 --> 2:04:00.180]  That's what sucks so much about this is that none of this needs to be going on, folks.
[2:04:00.180 --> 2:04:04.180]  All of this is totally unnecessary, but you know what?
[2:04:04.180 --> 2:04:09.180]  This is the challenge that God has given us with the gift of life and consciousness
[2:04:09.180 --> 2:04:13.180]  and everything that comes with it and all the beauty and splendor.
[2:04:13.180 --> 2:04:18.180]  That's the catch is that you're going to have to deal with evil.
[2:04:18.180 --> 2:04:21.180]  In a way, it's like the classic Beastie Boy song.
[2:04:21.180 --> 2:04:23.180]  You've got to fight for your right to party.
[2:04:23.180 --> 2:04:30.180]  It's like, hey, you've got to fight for your privilege of living on this planet free.
[2:04:30.180 --> 2:04:33.180]  It's not going to be given to you.
[2:04:33.180 --> 2:04:36.180]  You're going to be faced with demons.
[2:04:36.180 --> 2:04:39.180]  You're going to be faced with corruption.
[2:04:39.180 --> 2:04:47.180]  You're going to be faced with slavery and war and bondage and lies and propaganda.
[2:04:47.180 --> 2:04:51.180]  And it's the worst maybe it's ever been in the history of this planet right now.
[2:04:51.180 --> 2:04:58.180]  And it's just all unnecessary and it just breaks your heart to see what we're going into.
[2:04:58.180 --> 2:05:05.180]  Our world is so full of hype. We are force-fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate media,
[2:05:05.180 --> 2:05:08.180]  by the controlled churches and the universities.
[2:05:08.180 --> 2:05:10.180]  And why is this the case?
[2:05:10.180 --> 2:05:16.180]  Because we innately, by God, have been given the keys for our own minds, our own societies, our own souls.
[2:05:16.180 --> 2:05:24.180]  And by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves and transcend the quote, fallen or sinful state.
[2:05:24.180 --> 2:05:31.180]  So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to change who we are
[2:05:31.180 --> 2:05:34.180]  are only lowering us. They're only making us more depressed.
[2:05:34.180 --> 2:05:36.180]  In the end, they're only making us less fulfilled.
[2:05:36.180 --> 2:05:42.180]  It is only by going within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves.
[2:05:42.180 --> 2:05:48.180]  That's why the globalist, bombardist, and toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals
[2:05:48.180 --> 2:05:55.180]  and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[2:05:55.180 --> 2:06:19.180]  Incredible products come in at InfoWars.com.
[2:06:25.180 --> 2:06:35.180]  Headline, Washington Examiner, last month.
[2:06:35.180 --> 2:06:41.180]  Five times the White House said sanctions could deter Putin.
[2:06:41.180 --> 2:06:47.180]  And now here's Biden again today saying, the sanctions were never meant to deter Putin.
[2:06:47.180 --> 2:06:51.180]  And then Saki was asked about this same thing.
[2:06:51.180 --> 2:06:57.180]  Biden claimed that no one expected sanctions to prevent Russian invasion was not exactly what he meant.
[2:06:57.180 --> 2:07:01.180]  Because remember, last month, in the same day, within hours of one another,
[2:07:01.180 --> 2:07:06.180]  Biden made a public statement saying the sanctions were never meant to deter Putin.
[2:07:06.180 --> 2:07:11.180]  And Saki made a public statement saying the sanctions are meant to deter Putin.
[2:07:11.180 --> 2:07:18.180]  And so it's this miscommunication constantly with this joke of administration, this clown show.
[2:07:18.180 --> 2:07:25.180]  I don't get it. Are these people just filled with hatred in their heart?
[2:07:25.180 --> 2:07:28.180]  What is going on here?
[2:07:28.180 --> 2:07:33.180]  But I don't have time to sit here and pontificate. I need to cover the rest of this news.
[2:07:33.180 --> 2:07:38.180]  So let me just delve into this stack of news over here.
[2:07:38.180 --> 2:07:42.180]  Now, I do believe you're going to start seeing more of this.
[2:07:42.180 --> 2:07:51.180]  You have a probably one of the best third baseman in Major League Baseball.
[2:07:51.180 --> 2:07:56.180]  Definitely one of the better ballplayers, Manny Machado, doing an interview,
[2:07:56.180 --> 2:08:00.180]  and he's got a let's go Brandon shirt on.
[2:08:00.180 --> 2:08:03.180]  You know, here's what I've noticed too.
[2:08:03.180 --> 2:08:08.180]  Hispanics are probably the most conservative group of people in America right now.
[2:08:08.180 --> 2:08:12.180]  Or maybe it's not even about conservative or liberal or anything.
[2:08:12.180 --> 2:08:16.180]  They get what's going on more than anybody else.
[2:08:16.180 --> 2:08:23.180]  And, you know, there's something there culturally, I think, with Christianity and Catholicism.
[2:08:23.180 --> 2:08:29.180]  And there might even still be like some, you know, because they still have more of a historically close knit family unit.
[2:08:29.180 --> 2:08:34.180]  There might even be like pressure like, hey, you know, you don't be gay or anything like that.
[2:08:34.180 --> 2:08:39.180]  So they see all the Satanism going on and I mean, you talk to the average Hispanic American
[2:08:39.180 --> 2:08:43.180]  that, I mean, as long as they're not totally brainwashed, like they get it.
[2:08:43.180 --> 2:08:49.180]  Manny Machado, a baseball player with the let's go Brandon shirt on at spring training.
[2:08:49.180 --> 2:08:51.180]  I think that this is just the beginning, folks.
[2:08:51.180 --> 2:08:56.180]  I think athletes are going to slowly but surely start becoming more politically outspoken
[2:08:56.180 --> 2:08:59.180]  because they're just not going to have a choice.
[2:08:59.180 --> 2:09:04.180]  You don't think ball players like freedom like everybody else, of course they do.
[2:09:04.180 --> 2:09:11.180]  You don't think ball players have family that are getting crushed by this stuff?
[2:09:11.180 --> 2:09:13.180]  I expect that to continue.
[2:09:13.180 --> 2:09:21.180]  Joe Biden has demanded the resignation of Dr. Oz.
[2:09:21.180 --> 2:09:24.180]  I know Dr. Oz is a bit of a polarizing figure.
[2:09:24.180 --> 2:09:33.180]  I'm not here to comment on the individual, but he was the president's counsel on sports, fitness and nutrition.
[2:09:33.180 --> 2:09:39.180]  And he received an email today, Joe Biden demanding his resignation.
[2:09:39.180 --> 2:09:41.180]  Dr. Oz has responded.
[2:09:41.180 --> 2:09:49.180]  Joe Biden can't be around anyone who doesn't completely fall in line with his fear mongering authoritarian one size fits all COVID handling.
[2:09:49.180 --> 2:09:59.180]  I'm proud of my service and will not resign, so I imagine it'll be official by the end of today that Dr. Oz has been fired.
[2:09:59.180 --> 2:10:04.180]  Because he doesn't believe in medical fascism.
[2:10:04.180 --> 2:10:06.180]  You don't believe in medical fascism.
[2:10:06.180 --> 2:10:12.180]  You don't have a job in the Biden administration.
[2:10:12.180 --> 2:10:13.180]  You're not a sexual deviant.
[2:10:13.180 --> 2:10:15.180]  You're probably not a Biden.
[2:10:15.180 --> 2:10:18.180]  Bill Barr, now this is an interesting one.
[2:10:18.180 --> 2:10:26.180]  Remember, Bill Barr was scolding Donald Trump for talking about the Hunter Biden email and other such things.
[2:10:26.180 --> 2:10:34.180]  But on this story in particular, Bill Barr was part of the cover up of the Hunter Biden laptop.
[2:10:34.180 --> 2:10:40.180]  Well, now Bill Barr is upset because he was lied to by Joe Biden.
[2:10:40.180 --> 2:10:42.180]  Wow.
[2:10:42.180 --> 2:10:44.180]  Thought you were smart.
[2:10:44.180 --> 2:10:53.180]  Surprised by being lied to by Joe Biden, Bill Barr, Biden lied to the American people about his son, Hunter's emails.
[2:10:53.180 --> 2:11:04.180]  Really, Joe Biden in an election year, when his son's devious activity is exposed and their own political corruption is exposed,
[2:11:04.180 --> 2:11:11.180]  Biden lied about that the month before he was on a ballot to become president of the United States.
[2:11:11.180 --> 2:11:14.180]  He lied about that. Wow.
[2:11:14.180 --> 2:11:17.180]  Who could have seen that coming?
[2:11:17.180 --> 2:11:22.180]  Who could have seen Joe Biden lying about the laptop that shows he's guilty of all kinds of crimes?
[2:11:22.180 --> 2:11:26.180]  But Bill Barr is mad because he was lied to and he was deceived.
[2:11:26.180 --> 2:11:28.180]  And now he's embarrassed.
[2:11:28.180 --> 2:11:31.180]  He's embarrassed that he was on the wrong side of that history.
[2:11:31.180 --> 2:11:36.180]  Please, Bill Barr, you knew the laptop was real.
[2:11:36.180 --> 2:11:38.180]  You helped cover it up.
[2:11:38.180 --> 2:11:41.180]  You're not getting any sympathy points here.
[2:11:41.180 --> 2:11:45.180]  Give me a break.
[2:11:45.180 --> 2:11:53.180]  But see, there's a great story here in TabletMag, invasion of the fact checkers.
[2:11:53.180 --> 2:11:59.180]  And it's, you know, the laptop and everything, but basically here's how the story goes.
[2:11:59.180 --> 2:12:03.180]  Fact checkers exist for one reason and one reason only.
[2:12:03.180 --> 2:12:09.180]  And that's to convince you that Democrats are never wrong about anything ever.
[2:12:09.180 --> 2:12:13.180]  And Republicans are wrong about everything ever.
[2:12:13.180 --> 2:12:17.180]  And that's kind of a blanket statement to lump everybody into one political side.
[2:12:17.180 --> 2:12:20.180]  But you get the gist of it.
[2:12:20.180 --> 2:12:22.180]  Invasion of the fact checkers.
[2:12:22.180 --> 2:12:24.180]  Who are you going to believe?
[2:12:24.180 --> 2:12:30.180]  The Democrat Party's new official, unofficial, public, private, monopoly tech platform censorship brigade?
[2:12:30.180 --> 2:12:36.180]  Or your own misinformed, disinformed eyes?
[2:12:36.180 --> 2:12:39.180]  There's no such thing as these fact checkers.
[2:12:39.180 --> 2:12:46.180]  They're Democrat Party activists that only exist to tell you Democrats are never wrong about anything
[2:12:46.180 --> 2:12:51.180]  and Republicans are wrong about everything.
[2:12:51.180 --> 2:12:55.180]  Axios has the story. They're stunned, folks. They're stunned.
[2:12:55.180 --> 2:13:01.180]  Foreign propaganda organs, including those from Russia and China, have used a visa program designed to lure
[2:13:01.180 --> 2:13:09.180]  high-skilled workers to the U.S. to place reporters, editors, and producers at their American outposts records show.
[2:13:09.180 --> 2:13:13.180]  Really? Who would have thought?
[2:13:13.180 --> 2:13:17.180]  Propagandist plumb high-skilled visa program.
[2:13:17.180 --> 2:13:26.180]  Really, China sends propaganda agents to America like, oh, I don't know, maybe we could ask Eric Swalwell about that
[2:13:26.180 --> 2:13:29.180]  with his little fang bang.
[2:13:29.180 --> 2:13:31.180]  This one's hilarious.
[2:13:31.180 --> 2:13:39.180]  Stormy Daniels must pay $300,000 to Donald Trump after losing defamation case appeal.
[2:13:39.180 --> 2:13:45.180]  Stormy Daniels has to pay Trump.
[2:13:45.180 --> 2:13:52.180]  That's hilarious. Now, of course, she won a case against Michael Avenatti, who for a hot minute was the hero of the Democrat Party.
[2:13:52.180 --> 2:13:57.180]  That all fell apart soon. That fell apart real quick, and then his criminal activity got exposed.
[2:13:57.180 --> 2:14:03.180]  He had to pay Stormy Daniels $300,000, and now that money is going right to Donald Trump.
[2:14:03.180 --> 2:14:09.180]  Another, the hit men against Donald Trump fall on their own sword.
[2:14:09.180 --> 2:14:13.180]  Stormy Daniels and Michael Avenatti.
[2:14:13.180 --> 2:14:20.180]  Absolutely pathetic. Heroes of the Democrat Party end up being complete liars and losers.
[2:14:20.180 --> 2:14:27.180]  DOJ inadvertently publishes lists of clients of Sarah Lawrence's sex cult prostitute.
[2:14:27.180 --> 2:14:35.180]  New York City's elite are in a tizzy after the Justice Department inadvertently published a list of 121 clients,
[2:14:35.180 --> 2:14:46.180]  including lawyers, businessmen, socialists who solicited Sarah Lawrence's sex cult victim who was forced into prostitution.
[2:14:46.180 --> 2:14:52.180]  Yeah, folks, look, they're all in these sex cults, and maybe it's innocent enough,
[2:14:52.180 --> 2:14:54.180]  maybe some of it's used for blackmail.
[2:14:54.180 --> 2:14:59.180]  This is the political elite. This is the corporate elite.
[2:14:59.180 --> 2:15:06.180]  This is the lesser of the Jeffrey Epstein pedophile island sex trafficking operations.
[2:15:06.180 --> 2:15:13.180]  This is a couple notches below the nix of them sex cult, but I mean, it's eyes wide shut crap.
[2:15:13.180 --> 2:15:19.180]  Some celebrities and public figures have gone public about what happens.
[2:15:19.180 --> 2:15:25.180]  Like, yeah, they bring you into Hollywood parties, and they kind of slowly but surely introduce you to parties,
[2:15:25.180 --> 2:15:30.180]  and then and then drugs and then and then more intense drugs.
[2:15:30.180 --> 2:15:35.180]  And then and then the sex and the prostitutes and then the prostitutes get younger and younger and younger.
[2:15:35.180 --> 2:15:41.180]  And then, oh, it looks like an 18 year old open. No, she's 15. Now you're blackmail.
[2:15:41.180 --> 2:15:46.180]  But see, some people just dive right in because they like the sex cult stuff and they like having this weird orgy stuff.
[2:15:46.180 --> 2:15:50.180]  Some people get trapped into it, but it's all out there now.
[2:15:50.180 --> 2:15:55.180]  It's all getting exposed and the media just covers it up because they're involved.
[2:16:20.180 --> 2:16:24.180]  Take the tools God gave us and supercharge our immune systems.

[2:18:49.180 --> 2:18:53.180]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[2:18:53.180 --> 2:18:57.180]  And that's why it's hard to share infowars links and band up video links.
[2:18:57.180 --> 2:19:10.180]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[2:19:10.180 --> 2:19:17.180]  This infowars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the infowars store.
[2:19:17.180 --> 2:19:24.180]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[2:19:24.180 --> 2:19:35.180]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[2:19:35.180 --> 2:19:44.180]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[2:19:44.180 --> 2:19:57.180]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations like here in America. So next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[2:20:14.180 --> 2:20:38.180]  All right, it is the final day of the Judge Jackson hearings. She's done nothing that would warrant her a position on the Supreme Court bench except maybe the fact that she was the judge that handled the pizza gate shooter.
[2:20:38.180 --> 2:20:51.180]  And for obvious reasons, I'm just going to leave it right there. But no, that's not the alarming thing that she just happened to have the case of the pizza gate shooter and then the interesting history of that gentlemen.
[2:20:51.180 --> 2:20:58.180]  We completely disavow any violence and fake news.
[2:20:58.180 --> 2:21:09.180]  But no, that's that's not what's so alarming and interesting little ripple there. But it's her history protecting pedophiles.
[2:21:09.180 --> 2:21:15.180]  And it's so funny because I've got this clip and maybe I'll play it right now.
[2:21:15.180 --> 2:21:31.180]  We've got Corey Booker. And folks, I mean, this is just total clown show stuff. Here's Corey Booker comparing Judge Jackson to Harriet Tubman.
[2:21:31.180 --> 2:21:35.180]  It's just it's just such ridiculousness. Do I even play it?
[2:21:35.180 --> 2:21:44.180]  But here you go. You want to see some of the clown show? Here's clown show Spartacus Corey Booker comparing Judge Jackson to Harriet Tubman.
[2:21:44.180 --> 2:21:47.180]  Harriet Tubman.
[2:21:47.180 --> 2:21:54.180]  I mean, one of my heroes because the more I read about this person, the more this is ridiculous.
[2:21:54.180 --> 2:22:03.180]  She was viciously beaten for a whole life. She used to fall into spells, cracked skull.
[2:22:03.180 --> 2:22:06.180]  She faced starvation chased by dogs.
[2:22:06.180 --> 2:22:18.180]  I mean, folks, it was real quick. So he's here talking about the torture Harriet Tubman had to endure as if he's trying to get a lead role in a an a thespian class or something.
[2:22:18.180 --> 2:22:23.180]  Spartacus Booker. I mean, this guy's as phony as a three dollar bill.
[2:22:23.180 --> 2:22:28.180]  And just the over exaggeration of everything. And so he's sitting, Oh, Harriet Tubman beaten and all this stuff.
[2:22:28.180 --> 2:22:37.180]  You're going to compare that to Judge Jackson, who literally has gotten everywhere she is in life because of her skin color, including the Supreme Court.
[2:22:37.180 --> 2:22:40.180]  And you're going to compare the two.
[2:22:40.180 --> 2:22:43.180]  Like I'm seeing people comparing her to Rosa Parks.
[2:22:43.180 --> 2:22:54.180]  So you're going to you're going to make the historical comparison to black Americans who were punished for their skin color.
[2:22:54.180 --> 2:22:59.180]  And you're going to say that that's the same as someone who's been rewarded for their skin color.
[2:22:59.180 --> 2:23:02.180]  Again, I just it's just total clown world.
[2:23:02.180 --> 2:23:05.180]  Here, let's see how long you can put up with the clown.
[2:23:05.180 --> 2:23:07.180]  Cory Booker here.
[2:23:07.180 --> 2:23:13.180]  She rest no she went back again and again and again.
[2:23:13.180 --> 2:23:17.180]  The star was the sky was full of stars.
[2:23:17.180 --> 2:23:22.180]  But she found one that was a harbinger of hope.
[2:23:22.180 --> 2:23:28.180]  For better days, not just for her and those people that were enslaved, but a harbinger of hope for this country.
[2:23:28.180 --> 2:23:30.180]  And she never gave up on America.
[2:23:30.180 --> 2:23:38.180]  She fought in the led troops in the Civil War.
[2:23:38.180 --> 2:23:42.180]  She was involved in the suffrage movement.
[2:23:42.180 --> 2:23:48.180]  And as I came back from my run after being mere assaulted by a by someone on the street.
[2:23:48.180 --> 2:23:50.180]  Oh, yeah, I'm sure that happened.
[2:23:50.180 --> 2:23:51.180]  Thought about her.
[2:23:51.180 --> 2:23:52.180]  Oh, my God.
[2:23:52.180 --> 2:23:53.180]  She looked up.
[2:23:53.180 --> 2:23:54.180]  She kept looking up.
[2:23:54.180 --> 2:23:56.180]  No matter what they did to her, she never stopped looking up.
[2:23:56.180 --> 2:24:05.180]  Now he's Harriet Tubman and that star was a harbinger of hope.
[2:24:05.180 --> 2:24:07.180]  Oh, my God.
[2:24:07.180 --> 2:24:09.180]  Hey, you're my star.
[2:24:09.180 --> 2:24:14.180]  You are my harbinger of hope.
[2:24:14.180 --> 2:24:17.180]  This country is getting better and better and better.
[2:24:17.180 --> 2:24:18.180]  Really?
[2:24:18.180 --> 2:24:21.180]  For who?
[2:24:21.180 --> 2:24:22.180]  I've never heard him say that before.
[2:24:22.180 --> 2:24:28.180]  You ascend onto the highest court in the land.
[2:24:28.180 --> 2:24:30.180]  I'm going to rejoice.
[2:24:30.180 --> 2:24:32.180]  Wow.
[2:24:32.180 --> 2:24:37.180]  Talk about a psychotic mess.
[2:24:37.180 --> 2:24:39.180]  Cory Booker.
[2:24:39.180 --> 2:24:50.180]  So Cory Booker has now compared himself to Spartacus and Harriet Tubman.
[2:24:50.180 --> 2:24:57.180]  This is just, that's what I'm saying, folks, is I just don't want to deal with these people anymore.
[2:24:57.180 --> 2:24:58.180]  I don't.
[2:24:58.180 --> 2:24:59.180]  I'm done with you.
[2:24:59.180 --> 2:25:00.180]  I don't want to deal with that.
[2:25:00.180 --> 2:25:01.180]  I don't care.
[2:25:01.180 --> 2:25:02.180]  Cory Booker, you go out.
[2:25:02.180 --> 2:25:03.180]  You do your thing.
[2:25:03.180 --> 2:25:07.180]  Whatever that is, whatever your thing is, man, you're Harriet Tubman, you're Spartacus,
[2:25:07.180 --> 2:25:16.180]  you're Jesus Christ, you're Mahatma Gandhi, you're Nelson Mandela, you're Han Solo, you're,
[2:25:16.180 --> 2:25:17.180]  I mean, you're all of it, dude.
[2:25:17.180 --> 2:25:19.180]  You're the greatest thing ever.
[2:25:19.180 --> 2:25:22.180]  I don't want to deal with these people anymore.
[2:25:22.180 --> 2:25:26.180]  Can you just leave us alone, please?
[2:25:26.180 --> 2:25:30.180]  They'll never leave us alone.
[2:25:30.180 --> 2:25:36.180]  That's the problem here.
[2:25:36.180 --> 2:25:47.180]  See, the American left can't exist politically without you to subjugate.
[2:25:47.180 --> 2:25:53.180]  The American left and its political policies cannot exist without subjects.
[2:25:53.180 --> 2:25:55.180]  They need someone to tax.
[2:25:55.180 --> 2:25:56.180]  They need someone to censor.
[2:25:56.180 --> 2:25:58.180]  They need someone to demonize.
[2:25:58.180 --> 2:26:01.180]  They need someone to arrest.
[2:26:01.180 --> 2:26:06.180]  All of their policy is based off needing somebody to subjugate.
[2:26:06.180 --> 2:26:10.180]  We just want to be left alone, man, but they need us.
[2:26:10.180 --> 2:26:17.180]  Their policies need us.
[2:26:17.180 --> 2:26:22.180]  Harrison, or excuse me, I think Harrison Ford, Han Solo.
[2:26:22.180 --> 2:26:24.180]  Cory Booker is Han Solo.
[2:26:24.180 --> 2:26:28.180]  Cory Booker is Luke Skywalker.
[2:26:28.180 --> 2:26:30.180]  Cory Booker is Rosa Parks.
[2:26:30.180 --> 2:26:34.180]  Cory Booker is Spartacus.
[2:26:34.180 --> 2:26:37.180]  Cory Booker is Hercules.
[2:26:37.180 --> 2:26:42.180]  And this is just, it's just complete clown show stuff.
[2:26:42.180 --> 2:26:45.180]  Go do your clown shows, bro.
[2:26:45.180 --> 2:26:48.180]  Just please leave us alone.
[2:26:48.180 --> 2:26:52.180]  No, they'll never leave us alone.
[2:26:52.180 --> 2:26:59.180]  Here's Senator Howley highlighting Judge Jackson saying that
[2:26:59.180 --> 2:27:01.180]  sex abusers are victims in this country.
[2:27:01.180 --> 2:27:04.180]  I'm not even kidding you.
[2:27:04.180 --> 2:27:09.180]  Here it is from one of her cases where she led a pedophile off the hook.
[2:27:09.180 --> 2:27:14.180]  I feel so sorry for them and for you and for the anguish that this has caused all of you.
[2:27:14.180 --> 2:27:16.180]  That's the sex offender.
[2:27:16.180 --> 2:27:18.180]  That's the pedophile.
[2:27:18.180 --> 2:27:23.180]  I also feel terrible about the collateral consequences of this conviction.
[2:27:23.180 --> 2:27:30.180]  Sex offenders are truly shunned in our society and I have no control over these collateral consequences.
[2:27:30.180 --> 2:27:34.180]  That's the comments from Judge Jackson.
[2:27:34.180 --> 2:27:43.180]  See, this is more of how the liberal left ideology and logic is absolutely illogical and really double-think.
[2:27:43.180 --> 2:27:52.180]  So who really makes it a national cause to shun sex offenders in our society?
[2:27:52.180 --> 2:27:54.180]  Well, that'd be the women's march.
[2:27:54.180 --> 2:27:56.180]  That'd be the Me Too movement, right?
[2:27:56.180 --> 2:27:58.180]  Of course, if you're a Democrat, it's all good.
[2:27:58.180 --> 2:28:00.180]  You're Bill Clinton. You can rape women. It's all good.
[2:28:00.180 --> 2:28:02.180]  You're Democrats in Virginia.
[2:28:02.180 --> 2:28:04.180]  You're Joe Biden with Tara Reid.
[2:28:04.180 --> 2:28:06.180]  You're the Cuomo's.
[2:28:06.180 --> 2:28:10.180]  It's all good. It's only if a Republican is accused or a conservative is accused that they care so much.
[2:28:10.180 --> 2:28:12.180]  But that's not even the point.
[2:28:12.180 --> 2:28:18.180]  They're the ones that claim any sex offender needs to be shunned from society worse person ever.
[2:28:18.180 --> 2:28:27.180]  Here's your judge, Jackson nominee, saying that sex offenders are the victims in this country.
[2:28:27.180 --> 2:28:32.180]  Where's your logic, liberals? Where's your logic, Democrats?
[2:28:32.180 --> 2:28:37.180]  It's like, I mean, seriously, how much more phoniness do you need to see from these people?
[2:28:37.180 --> 2:28:45.180]  Just look at the Cavanaugh hearings where they made up allegations against Brett Cavanaugh saying he should be shunned for sex offenses.
[2:28:45.180 --> 2:28:52.180]  Now they're about to nominate a judge who thinks it's bad that sex offenders are shunned.
[2:28:52.180 --> 2:28:56.180]  I'm done with these people, man. I just want them out of our lives.
[2:28:56.180 --> 2:28:59.180]  You know, it's a fact, and I'm not bragging when I say it.
[2:28:59.180 --> 2:29:05.180]  It's just true that InfoWars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty,
[2:29:05.180 --> 2:29:13.180]  as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[2:29:13.180 --> 2:29:20.180]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[2:29:20.180 --> 2:29:27.180]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them, at infowars.com.
[2:29:27.180 --> 2:29:30.180]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you.
[2:29:30.180 --> 2:29:35.180]  And so now we need to support more than ever because this fight has intensified.
[2:29:35.180 --> 2:29:38.180]  Don't need me to tell you that at infowars.com.
[2:29:38.180 --> 2:29:42.180]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[2:29:42.180 --> 2:29:47.180]  Things have been sold out for a long time, like InfoWars Life, Fizzy Magnesium Mix,
[2:29:47.180 --> 2:29:51.180]  that's so amazing, and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[2:29:51.180 --> 2:29:56.180]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at infowarsstore.com right now.
[2:29:56.180 --> 2:29:58.180]  Mike in California, thanks for calling.
[2:29:58.180 --> 2:30:02.180]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain-of-function research.
[2:30:02.180 --> 2:30:05.180]  Now, if you read the actual, you know, 2014 legislation,
[2:30:05.180 --> 2:30:12.180]  the U.S. government gain-of-function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain-of-function research
[2:30:12.180 --> 2:30:15.180]  involving influenza, MERS, and SARS viruses.
[2:30:15.180 --> 2:30:17.180]  There's nothing about SARS-like viruses.
[2:30:17.180 --> 2:30:21.180]  And if the research funding pause, it's not a stop, it's not a prohibition.
[2:30:21.180 --> 2:30:25.180]  It's when you come to a four-way intersection, there's the stop sign, you stop, you look both ways,
[2:30:25.180 --> 2:30:26.180]  and then you proceed.
[2:30:26.180 --> 2:30:31.180]  And so it's also, it doesn't pause all gain-of-function, just selected gain-of-function.
[2:30:31.180 --> 2:30:35.180]  But they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research.
[2:30:35.180 --> 2:30:38.180]  So, you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right.
[2:30:38.180 --> 2:30:41.180]  They don't quite know what they're talking about, calling it gain-of-function.
[2:30:41.180 --> 2:30:43.180]  You know, that's why he didn't perjure himself.
[2:30:43.180 --> 2:30:44.180]  That's why he hasn't been arrested.
[2:30:44.180 --> 2:30:48.180]  Because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do.
[2:30:48.180 --> 2:30:51.180]  But in the main definition, it's still a gain-of-function.
[2:30:51.180 --> 2:30:55.180]  If you're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people, thank you, Mike.
[2:30:55.180 --> 2:30:56.180]  We love you.
[2:30:56.180 --> 2:31:06.180]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep
[2:31:06.180 --> 2:31:13.180]  France that the general public is in, the best word would actually be the people are lost.
[2:31:13.180 --> 2:31:19.180]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare, or you're in a car, or you
[2:31:19.180 --> 2:31:25.180]  get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy.
[2:31:25.180 --> 2:31:26.180]  And confused.
[2:31:26.180 --> 2:31:27.180]  You have a concussion.
[2:31:27.180 --> 2:31:29.180]  And that's what the globalists have done.
[2:31:29.180 --> 2:31:31.180]  They have stunned us.
[2:31:31.180 --> 2:31:34.180]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings.
[2:31:34.180 --> 2:31:38.180]  And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave a speech he called The Great New Narrative,
[2:31:38.180 --> 2:31:43.180]  where he brags how the public is lost, how the culture in the media has been driven to
[2:31:43.180 --> 2:31:48.180]  make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[2:31:48.180 --> 2:31:50.180]  That's what the great reset is.
[2:31:50.180 --> 2:31:52.180]  They need darkness to thrive.
[2:31:52.180 --> 2:31:56.180]  The light lives at nfowars.com.
[2:31:56.180 --> 2:32:01.180]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[2:32:01.180 --> 2:32:03.180]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[2:32:03.180 --> 2:32:05.180]  I was barely holding on to a job.
[2:32:05.180 --> 2:32:08.180]  And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[2:32:08.180 --> 2:32:11.180]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1.
[2:32:11.180 --> 2:32:12.180]  And it worked pretty good.
[2:32:12.180 --> 2:32:14.180]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that.
[2:32:14.180 --> 2:32:18.180]  You had, you know, with a deep burdened source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[2:32:18.180 --> 2:32:19.180]  So I took it.
[2:32:19.180 --> 2:32:25.180]  In two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[2:32:25.180 --> 2:32:28.180]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[2:32:28.180 --> 2:32:32.180]  And over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back
[2:32:32.180 --> 2:32:35.180]  and I religiously took basically all of your supplements.
[2:32:35.180 --> 2:32:37.180]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[2:32:37.180 --> 2:32:39.180]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[2:32:39.180 --> 2:32:41.180]  Literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[2:32:41.180 --> 2:32:42.180]  It's amazing. It works.
[2:32:42.180 --> 2:32:45.180]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[2:32:45.180 --> 2:32:47.180]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[2:32:47.180 --> 2:32:51.180]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[2:32:51.180 --> 2:32:52.180]  Beautifully said, brother.
[2:32:52.180 --> 2:33:18.180]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[2:33:22.180 --> 2:33:30.180]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[2:33:30.180 --> 2:33:37.180]  So in the break, I'm watching an old clip of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings.
[2:33:37.180 --> 2:33:39.180]  And it's just so frustrating, man.
[2:33:39.180 --> 2:33:41.180]  These Democrats, Joe Biden, they've never changed.
[2:33:41.180 --> 2:33:44.180]  They have literally never changed, folks.
[2:33:44.180 --> 2:33:47.180]  They've never changed.
[2:33:47.180 --> 2:33:53.180]  And, you know, the great one, Rush Limbaugh, would always say this.
[2:33:53.180 --> 2:34:01.180]  It was always one of his most fierce talking points was how the Democrats have never changed.
[2:34:01.180 --> 2:34:03.180]  They've always been this way.
[2:34:03.180 --> 2:34:08.180]  It's just more and more as time goes on, people start to realize what evil monsters they are.
[2:34:08.180 --> 2:34:12.180]  So I'm going to play it on the war room coming up that I'm hosting at 3 p.m.
[2:34:12.180 --> 2:34:18.180]  Just a reminder, what they did to Brett Kavanaugh, they did to Clarence Thomas.
[2:34:18.180 --> 2:34:21.180]  These are sick bastards.
[2:34:21.180 --> 2:34:25.180]  These are demonic monsters.
[2:34:25.180 --> 2:34:30.180]  And see, my problem is I'm so sick and damn tired of these people.
[2:34:30.180 --> 2:34:39.180]  I just want to step up, unplug my earpiece, shut off the microphone,
[2:34:39.180 --> 2:34:44.180]  walk out of this studio and just be done with it.
[2:34:44.180 --> 2:34:50.180]  But I can't do that because who else is going to fight these monsters?
[2:34:50.180 --> 2:34:52.180]  Who else is going to expose these monsters?
[2:34:52.180 --> 2:35:00.180]  Who else is going to sit here and take the bullets and the flak and the arrows and the shrapnel from these monsters?
[2:35:00.180 --> 2:35:08.180]  I mean, they've already got the fish hook spear into my side trying to put me on board of their prison boat.
[2:35:08.180 --> 2:35:14.180]  They've already got vampires and...
[2:35:14.180 --> 2:35:19.180]  Let me just stop right there and cover this news.
[2:35:19.180 --> 2:35:22.180]  It's not even about me.
[2:35:22.180 --> 2:35:25.180]  I'm so sick of these people destroying our planet.
[2:35:25.180 --> 2:35:29.180]  I'm so sick of these people destroying our way of life, destroying our country.
[2:35:29.180 --> 2:35:32.180]  None of this has to be going on, folks. None of it.
[2:35:32.180 --> 2:35:34.180]  Infowars doesn't have to exist.
[2:35:34.180 --> 2:35:36.180]  You don't have to be getting crushed at the pump.
[2:35:36.180 --> 2:35:38.180]  You don't have to be getting crushed with taxes.
[2:35:38.180 --> 2:35:45.180]  You don't have to deal with pedophile drag queen story times and gay pride parade for kids and fake news.
[2:35:45.180 --> 2:35:47.180]  None of it. None of it.
[2:35:47.180 --> 2:35:49.180]  We shouldn't be dealing with any of it.
[2:35:49.180 --> 2:35:51.180]  It should all be done.
[2:35:51.180 --> 2:35:53.180]  It should be over with.
[2:35:53.180 --> 2:35:56.180]  See, that's why I need to stop because I lose my patience. I lose my temper.
[2:35:56.180 --> 2:35:58.180]  I pray to God I'm not going to do it anymore.
[2:35:58.180 --> 2:36:02.180]  I'm sure I will fall short of that, but...
[2:36:02.180 --> 2:36:05.180]  That's what I'm saying. You just go back in time
[2:36:05.180 --> 2:36:08.180]  and you just look. These people have never changed.
[2:36:08.180 --> 2:36:12.180]  Joe Biden has always been a lying monster.
[2:36:12.180 --> 2:36:16.180]  Hillary Clinton has always been a lying monster.
[2:36:16.180 --> 2:36:23.180]  The Democrat Party has always been a bunch of monstrous terrorist demons.
[2:36:23.180 --> 2:36:25.180]  I apologize. I promised I wouldn't do that.
[2:36:25.180 --> 2:36:28.180]  So let me just get into the news.
[2:36:28.180 --> 2:36:31.180]  By the way, we'll cover the Clarence Thomas clip on the war room
[2:36:31.180 --> 2:36:35.180]  and also we're going to have Christie Lee joining us in the field
[2:36:35.180 --> 2:36:39.180]  from a gay pride parade for kids.
[2:36:39.180 --> 2:36:41.180]  That's what I'm going to start doing actually.
[2:36:41.180 --> 2:36:43.180]  I was thinking about this too.
[2:36:43.180 --> 2:36:48.180]  Maybe it's just time to go straight comical here, straight satire here.
[2:36:48.180 --> 2:36:54.180]  I'm just going to be a leftist liberal and I'm going to celebrate drag queen story time.
[2:36:54.180 --> 2:36:56.180]  I'm going to celebrate gay pride parade for kids
[2:36:56.180 --> 2:37:00.180]  and I'm going to celebrate medical fascism and tyranny
[2:37:00.180 --> 2:37:04.180]  because here's what I've realized.
[2:37:04.180 --> 2:37:11.180]  There is no effective way of changing a liberal's heart or mind.
[2:37:11.180 --> 2:37:13.180]  It's not going to happen.
[2:37:13.180 --> 2:37:19.180]  But what you can do is you can embody their beliefs and their politics
[2:37:19.180 --> 2:37:21.180]  and their ideologies and their logic.
[2:37:21.180 --> 2:37:25.180]  You can embody that and you can put on the demon avatar suit
[2:37:25.180 --> 2:37:29.180]  of a Democrat liberal progressive and you can just go to their events
[2:37:29.180 --> 2:37:31.180]  and say, this is great.
[2:37:31.180 --> 2:37:37.180]  I love gay kids because when they see that coming out of your mouth
[2:37:37.180 --> 2:37:44.180]  and when they see you promoting their sycophant ideas and ideologies
[2:37:44.180 --> 2:37:48.180]  then they'll have to push back against it and realize how evil it is.
[2:37:48.180 --> 2:37:49.180]  See how that works?
[2:37:49.180 --> 2:37:54.180]  It's a level of reverse psychology but it's deeper
[2:37:54.180 --> 2:38:04.180]  because their drive to hate us is actually more powerful than their actual ideologies.
[2:38:04.180 --> 2:38:09.180]  So I say good, let's chop little boys' balls off
[2:38:09.180 --> 2:38:14.180]  and let's have gay pride parades and let's teach 10-year-olds how to masturbate with one another
[2:38:14.180 --> 2:38:17.180]  and let's even have live masturbation classes
[2:38:17.180 --> 2:38:20.180]  and let's give them dildos and vibrators and sex toys
[2:38:20.180 --> 2:38:25.180]  and let's show them how to use them and they don't even have gone through puberty yet
[2:38:25.180 --> 2:38:26.180]  but this is a good thing.
[2:38:26.180 --> 2:38:27.180]  So that's what I'm saying.
[2:38:27.180 --> 2:38:30.180]  It's like maybe we just do satire now and just come out
[2:38:30.180 --> 2:38:33.180]  and I'm just pro all the liberal ideology.
[2:38:33.180 --> 2:38:35.180]  I want World War III with Russia.
[2:38:35.180 --> 2:38:37.180]  I want nuclear war with Russia.
[2:38:37.180 --> 2:38:41.180]  I want little kids being taught how to have gay and gay sex and anal sex
[2:38:41.180 --> 2:38:42.180]  and use dildos and everything.
[2:38:42.180 --> 2:38:44.180]  I think it's all good.
[2:38:44.180 --> 2:38:52.180]  And I think that pedophiles and child porn rapists and distributors of that material should get light sentences.
[2:38:52.180 --> 2:38:54.180]  Absolutely.
[2:38:54.180 --> 2:38:55.180]  And I agree.
[2:38:55.180 --> 2:38:59.180]  We should censor people that have speech that I disagree with
[2:38:59.180 --> 2:39:03.180]  and I think we should have forced medical procedures.
[2:39:03.180 --> 2:39:04.180]  Absolutely.
[2:39:04.180 --> 2:39:08.180]  But see, that's what I'm saying is when you introduce that doctrine
[2:39:08.180 --> 2:39:21.180]  and you propose that to them as if you're in support of it, their entire brain and soul just starts to malfunction.
[2:39:21.180 --> 2:39:26.180]  Donald Trump sues Hillary Clinton and others over Russian collusion allegations.
[2:39:26.180 --> 2:39:29.180]  That's an interesting move.
[2:39:29.180 --> 2:39:35.180]  We'll see what comes of that.
[2:39:35.180 --> 2:39:39.180]  Donald Trump sues Hillary Clinton and others over Russia collusion allegations.
[2:39:39.180 --> 2:39:46.180]  I hope he has good lawyers and I hope we get discovery because we all know what happened there.
[2:39:46.180 --> 2:39:47.180]  Don't we?
[2:39:47.180 --> 2:39:50.180]  Don't we indeed?
[2:39:50.180 --> 2:39:55.180]  Project Veritas says Fed secretly accessed its emails.
[2:39:55.180 --> 2:39:57.180]  Totally illegal.
[2:39:57.180 --> 2:40:04.180]  NYPD over DNA database that contains genetic profiles of innocent New Yorkers sued.
[2:40:04.180 --> 2:40:05.180]  Yeah.
[2:40:05.180 --> 2:40:13.180]  Well, wait till you figure out what they did with your nasal swab from your COVID test.
[2:40:13.180 --> 2:40:16.180]  Wait till you figure that one out.
[2:40:16.180 --> 2:40:19.180]  Then you'll really know what's going on.
[2:40:19.180 --> 2:40:25.180]  It is not just them collecting random DNA samples.
[2:40:25.180 --> 2:40:32.180]  They are collecting it any which way they can.
[2:40:32.180 --> 2:40:33.180]  Where do I want to go next?
[2:40:33.180 --> 2:40:38.180]  I mean, I just got this stack of gay pride parade for kids and pedophile story time for kids.
[2:40:38.180 --> 2:40:41.180]  It's just all great.
[2:40:41.180 --> 2:40:47.180]  They block parents out from going into the building because they don't like their kids being taught how to have gay sex.
[2:40:47.180 --> 2:40:49.180]  They don't like their kids being taught how to be racist.
[2:40:49.180 --> 2:40:51.180]  So the schools just say, oh, parents are banned.
[2:40:51.180 --> 2:40:53.180]  You can't come in.
[2:40:53.180 --> 2:40:56.180]  You're not allowed to be here and then they get arrested when they try.
[2:40:56.180 --> 2:40:57.180]  It's liberals.
[2:40:57.180 --> 2:40:59.180]  It's a good thing.
[2:40:59.180 --> 2:41:04.180]  I love this story from Spencer Clavin at the American Mind.
[2:41:04.180 --> 2:41:10.180]  And while I agree with the content of the story, the headline is creating conspiracy theorists,
[2:41:10.180 --> 2:41:15.180]  turning basic facts into thought crimes, turns normal people into thought criminals.
[2:41:15.180 --> 2:41:18.180]  And you get the idea, but here's the thing.
[2:41:18.180 --> 2:41:27.180]  It's not that the radical left or the fake news media or all this other garbage is turning people into conspiracy theorists.
[2:41:27.180 --> 2:41:31.180]  It's that the conspiracy theorists were right.
[2:41:31.180 --> 2:41:33.180]  That's the headline.
[2:41:33.180 --> 2:41:44.180]  The madness of the fake news media and the liberal left progressives and the Judge Jackson taking it easy on pedophiles saying they're the victims.
[2:41:44.180 --> 2:41:46.180]  That's not creating conspiracy theorists.
[2:41:46.180 --> 2:41:50.180]  That's confirming that the conspiracy theorists were right.
[2:41:50.180 --> 2:41:55.180]  So that's the real headline is conspiracy theorists were right.
[2:41:55.180 --> 2:42:00.180]  But I understand the notion that he proposes in the story is basically like when you say men are women,
[2:42:00.180 --> 2:42:04.180]  when you say obese people are healthy, when you say kids need to be sexualized,
[2:42:04.180 --> 2:42:08.180]  when you hide the Hunter Biden laptop and all this stuff, when you lie about Russian collusion,
[2:42:08.180 --> 2:42:13.180]  you're creating conspiracy theorists, but it's really just the conspiracy theorists were right all along.
[2:42:13.180 --> 2:42:18.180]  Now you're just starting to realize it.
[2:42:18.180 --> 2:42:24.180]  Newt Gingrich says Kamala Harris may be the dumbest person ever elected vice president.
[2:42:24.180 --> 2:42:26.180]  He's probably right about that.
[2:42:26.180 --> 2:42:35.180]  George Soros showing his love and support for Madeleine Albright as she went down to we know where yesterday.
[2:42:35.180 --> 2:42:40.180]  George Soros said she was an astute stateswoman, a scholar, a champion for freedom and democracy.
[2:42:40.180 --> 2:42:44.180]  Yeah, she bombed people in Serbia where she supposedly was a rescued Jew came from.
[2:42:44.180 --> 2:42:50.180]  So two self-loathing Jews that basically acted like Nazis their whole life.
[2:42:50.180 --> 2:42:56.180]  They look like they could be related to celebrating Madeleine Albright a war criminal.
[2:42:56.180 --> 2:42:59.180]  Our world is so full of hype.
[2:42:59.180 --> 2:43:06.180]  We are force-fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate media, by the controlled churches and the universities.
[2:43:06.180 --> 2:43:08.180]  Why is this the case?
[2:43:08.180 --> 2:43:14.180]  Because we innately, by God, have been given the keys for our own minds, our own psyches, our own souls.
[2:43:14.180 --> 2:43:22.180]  And by connecting to God we can empower ourselves and transcend the quote, fallen or sinful state.
[2:43:22.180 --> 2:43:29.180]  So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to change who we are
[2:43:29.180 --> 2:43:32.180]  are only lowering us. They're only making us more depressed.
[2:43:32.180 --> 2:43:34.180]  In the end they're only making us less fulfilled.
[2:43:34.180 --> 2:43:40.180]  It is only by going within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves.
[2:43:40.180 --> 2:43:46.180]  That's why the globe was bombardous with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals
[2:43:46.180 --> 2:43:52.180]  and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[2:43:52.180 --> 2:43:56.180]  And that's where the incredible products come in at infostore.com.
[2:44:00.180 --> 2:44:04.180]  Granny Do Right. Granny Do Right. Thanks for holding her on the ear. Go ahead.
[2:44:04.180 --> 2:44:11.180]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there
[2:44:11.180 --> 2:44:18.180]  that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or H-spots as they're lovingly called.
[2:44:18.180 --> 2:44:24.180]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[2:44:24.180 --> 2:44:31.180]  People think I'm 55 years old. And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know,
[2:44:31.180 --> 2:44:35.180]  maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[2:44:35.180 --> 2:44:40.180]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time,
[2:44:40.180 --> 2:44:46.180]  I started noticing, okay, you know, this is the ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know.
[2:44:46.180 --> 2:44:50.180]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[2:44:50.180 --> 2:44:55.180]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:44:55.180 --> 2:45:02.180]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the world, from Australia to the United States,
[2:45:02.180 --> 2:45:07.180]  from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go,
[2:45:07.180 --> 2:45:14.180]  and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases, actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[2:45:14.180 --> 2:45:19.180]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote,
[2:45:19.180 --> 2:45:25.180]  healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety. This is nothing less than martial law.
[2:45:25.180 --> 2:45:29.180]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[2:45:29.180 --> 2:45:36.180]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military grade at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:45:36.180 --> 2:45:41.180]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit InfowarsStore.com.
[2:45:41.180 --> 2:45:48.180]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones, we've got them for laptops,
[2:45:48.180 --> 2:45:51.180]  we've got them for iPads. It's all there at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:45:51.180 --> 2:45:57.180]  So protect your privacy today and support the InfowarsStore.com.
[2:45:57.180 --> 2:46:01.180]  The Eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans.
[2:46:01.180 --> 2:46:08.180]  They financed major universities, they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda of New York Times,
[2:46:08.180 --> 2:46:14.180]  other major newspapers, that the family as we know it is a bad thing and must be ended.
[2:46:14.180 --> 2:46:20.180]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that cooking dinner
[2:46:20.180 --> 2:46:24.180]  and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[2:46:24.180 --> 2:46:28.180]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four-national daughter.
[2:46:28.180 --> 2:46:32.180]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well. I love to make breakfast.
[2:46:32.180 --> 2:46:38.180]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurturative
[2:46:38.180 --> 2:46:41.180]  and then all sit down together and have that communal event.
[2:46:41.180 --> 2:46:48.180]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions are coming together.
[2:46:48.180 --> 2:46:55.180]  They really are a sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that will domesticate us and turn us into lab rats.
[2:46:55.180 --> 2:47:15.180]  We cannot let this continue.
[2:47:25.180 --> 2:47:45.180]  Well, this is the final segment for me today on the Alex Jones show here at Infowars.
[2:47:45.180 --> 2:48:01.180]  Fighting corruption lies with the sword of truth and the shield of information right out of the Infowars World Headquarters here in Austin, Texas.
[2:48:01.180 --> 2:48:07.180]  Folks, don't take this transmission for granted. Do not take Infowars for granted.
[2:48:07.180 --> 2:48:12.180]  Support us by shopping at InfowarsStore.com. Remember to spread the links as well.
[2:48:12.180 --> 2:48:20.180]  And here would be my message to those that have supported us over the years and have spent a lot of your hard earned money here to keep us on the air.
[2:48:20.180 --> 2:48:30.180]  We can't say thank you enough, but to those that are tuned in and have never shopped at InfowarsStore.com and never supported us financially.
[2:48:30.180 --> 2:48:40.180]  Don't sit on the sidelines any longer because you don't want the day to come where you tune into Infowars and it's no longer there.
[2:48:40.180 --> 2:48:48.180]  And you think, man, I just wish I would have purchased toothpaste from their store or wish I would have purchased their coffee or gotten some emergency food supplies
[2:48:48.180 --> 2:48:54.180]  or an air filter or a water filter or some of their supplements or made a donation because they're not here anymore.
[2:48:54.180 --> 2:49:00.180]  Your prayers, your sharing of the video links, it's what keeps us on the air, folks.
[2:49:00.180 --> 2:49:15.180]  But I don't know when Alex is going to be able to come back on air and I'm not sure how much of the behind the scenes stuff he's going to want to talk about with the attacks we're under.
[2:49:15.180 --> 2:49:25.180]  But I mean, it's serious stuff here, folks, and that's why it's such a distraction to deal with all of that.
[2:49:25.180 --> 2:49:32.180]  And it's such a challenge to even come on air and be effective with all of this stuff going on and the thoughts churning in the back of your mind
[2:49:32.180 --> 2:49:34.180]  of how you're going to deal with it or even going to last.
[2:49:34.180 --> 2:49:46.180]  They're going to try to crush you, imprison you, but you still have to just put all that in the back of your mind and try to be as informative as possible here.
[2:49:46.180 --> 2:49:58.180]  But just know that we need more support now than ever. We're not going to beg for it, but just know that that's the case.
[2:49:58.180 --> 2:50:00.180]  And we make it easy. We've got great supplements.
[2:50:00.180 --> 2:50:08.180]  Who doesn't want a strong immune system? Who doesn't want to have a good immune system, especially in this day and age with man-made viruses getting released?
[2:50:08.180 --> 2:50:19.180]  Immune support formula at InfowarsStore.com. 25% off. Fizzy Magnesium Orange Drink Mix. Very popular around here.
[2:50:19.180 --> 2:50:22.180]  You're going to love it. The flavor, it's good for your health.
[2:50:22.180 --> 2:50:32.180]  Quit giving your kids unhealthy soda drinks or unhealthy juice drinks that aren't even real juice and just have processed sugar and high fructose corn syrup.
[2:50:32.180 --> 2:50:38.180]  Quit giving them those to drink. Pour them a glass of Fizzy Magnesium. They'll love it.
[2:50:38.180 --> 2:50:48.180]  Pour them a glass of Vitamin Mineral Fusion. They'll love it. Both exclusively available at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:50:48.180 --> 2:50:55.180]  Now, I've got a couple other news stories and video clips to play here, and then Paul Joseph Watson hosts the fourth hour.
[2:50:55.180 --> 2:51:06.180]  I'll be back hosting the War Room live guest Christy Lee from the site of a Children's Gay Pride Parade where they block parents out from going in to try to stop it.
[2:51:06.180 --> 2:51:16.180]  I'm not even kidding you. That's how bad it is. Russian Ministry of Defense, Hunter Biden, George Soros, Pentagon, and CDC involved in Ukrainian bio labs.
[2:51:16.180 --> 2:51:28.180]  Now you see what is really going on with Russia and Ukraine. They don't want the corrupt West with the Bidens and Soroses running biological weapons labs on their doorstep.
[2:51:28.180 --> 2:51:35.180]  U.S. to accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. Oh, that's great. So we brought in all the Afghani refugees.
[2:51:35.180 --> 2:51:43.180]  Now we're bringing all the Ukrainian refugees, not to mention we're on pace for 2 million illegal immigrant border crossings this year.
[2:51:43.180 --> 2:51:54.180]  It's great. You're paying for all of it, too. You can't even afford gas anymore. Your energy bills are going up. Everything's going up, but you're going to pay for people to come invade your country, too.
[2:51:54.180 --> 2:51:59.180]  Do you like living in the clown world? Is it fun or what? What a great time.
[2:51:59.180 --> 2:52:17.180]  Here's Justin Trudeau getting called out by MP Mislov Kolosic from Croatia. Listen to this stunning endorsement. I say jokingly, in clip 2.
[2:52:17.180 --> 2:52:35.180]  Unfortunately today, there are those who trample on fundamental values. Canada, once a symbol of the modern world, has become a symbol of civil rights violations.
[2:52:35.180 --> 2:52:58.180]  Under your quasi-liberal boot in recent months, we watched how you trample women with horses, how you block the bank accounts of single parents so that they can't even pay their children's education and medicine,
[2:52:58.180 --> 2:53:18.180]  that they can't pay utilities, mortgages for their homes. To you, these may be liberal methods. For many citizens of the world, it is a dictatorship of the worst kind.
[2:53:18.180 --> 2:53:34.180]  Rest assured that the citizens of the world united can stop any regime that wants to destroy the freedom of citizens either by bombs or harmful pharmaceutical products.
[2:53:34.180 --> 2:53:50.180]  Thank you. Wow. That lays it all out right there. And by the way, Trudeau is just getting scolded by his own parliament now, too. There is a lady, I keep forgetting her name. I think it's Christina LeGrand, maybe?
[2:53:50.180 --> 2:54:07.180]  The blonde lady in Canada's parliament who now, to me, has to be the frontrunner to replace Trudeau. She's just been incredible. And then, this is hilarious, in Slovakia, they basically had their parliamentary meeting.
[2:54:07.180 --> 2:54:22.180]  This was like at the State of the Union, essentially would be the best, it's maybe not the best analogy, but it's the best I can come up with where all the Democrats and Republicans were all waving the Ukraine flag dressed in Ukraine colors and half the State of the Union was about Ukraine.
[2:54:22.180 --> 2:54:38.180]  It shows you what they really want. So here's members of the Slovakian parliament waving the Ukrainian flag in the parliamentary building and the Slovakian patriots put their own flag on top of it poured water on the masked individuals.
[2:54:38.180 --> 2:54:47.180]  Of course, they're wearing masks. These are the brainwashed minions of the New World Order. Wearing masks, holding the Ukraine flag the wrong way, upside down, it just shows you how they don't even know anything.
[2:54:47.180 --> 2:54:54.180]  The blue part goes on top, it represents the sky, the yellow part goes on bottom, it represents the crops. They don't even know the basics.
[2:54:54.180 --> 2:55:08.180]  And then it's so funny because you watch the Slovenian patriots are the ones not wearing masks, they pour water on these deranged leftists that are holding the Ukraine flag upside down, and none of the Slovanians waving the Slovenian flag are wearing masks.
[2:55:08.180 --> 2:55:21.180]  I mean, this right here is everything in a nutshell. You have pride in your own country. You have nothing to do with Ukraine. You're not wearing a mask because you don't fall for that propaganda either.
[2:55:21.180 --> 2:55:30.180]  So it's the same thing. You're not falling for the Ukraine propaganda. You're waving your own flag. You're not falling for the COVID hysteria. You're not wearing a mask. They are.
[2:55:30.180 --> 2:55:39.180]  They're waving the Ukraine flag. They're wearing their masks. They support whatever the current propaganda thing is. Amazing stuff. Just amazing stuff.
[2:55:39.180 --> 2:55:48.180]  Now, here you are in clip four. Listen to what BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has to say in clip four.
[2:55:48.180 --> 2:55:59.180]  Well, behaviors are going to have to change, and this is one thing we're asking companies. You have to force behaviors. At BlackRock, we are forcing behaviors.
[2:55:59.180 --> 2:56:06.180]  See what it's all about? That's echoing the sentiments of Klaus Schwab and the Great Reset.
[2:56:06.180 --> 2:56:16.180]  Forcing behaviors. Like, you're not going to drive a car anymore. You're not going to own a house anymore. You're not going to fly and travel the world anymore.
[2:56:16.180 --> 2:56:28.180]  You're not going to have steak and potatoes for dinner anymore. You're going to have to change your behaviors because the corrupt elite of this planet that want to conquer it for themselves and hoard all the resources,
[2:56:28.180 --> 2:56:39.180]  that's how they look at it. The planet is theirs. They're in charge of the resources. They own and operate all the resources. You're not allowed access to it unless they say you can.
[2:56:39.180 --> 2:56:49.180]  And manmade climate change is the big myth, the big lie for the greater good that they're going to use to dominate you, conquer you and enslave you, and they're going to force you to change your behaviors.
[2:56:49.180 --> 2:56:56.180]  That's why your gas price is going up. That's why your taxes are going up. That's why they're censoring free speech. It's all the same.
[2:56:56.180 --> 2:57:08.180]  They're forcing you to be a slave. They're forcing you into the behavioral aspects of being a slave. You own nothing. You get no, you get no right to self-defense.
[2:57:08.180 --> 2:57:15.180]  You have no right to free speech. You have no right to question your government or media. You have no freedoms. You own nothing. You live in a pod.
[2:57:15.180 --> 2:57:23.180]  You're just lucky to even be alive. You're just lucky to even be alive and getting the bugs to eat and the pod to lay in all day and watch Netflix.
[2:57:23.180 --> 2:57:29.180]  This is Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, Larry Fink's Planet Now. And you're just a termite here eating their resources.
[2:57:29.180 --> 2:57:38.180]  So they're going to force you to change their behaviors by making your life miserable until you comply with their slave agenda for the whole planet.
[2:57:38.180 --> 2:57:54.180]  Paul Joseph Watson coming up. I'll be back hosting the war room after that.
[2:58:08.180 --> 2:58:12.180]  I want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalist making their main move.
[2:58:12.180 --> 2:58:18.180]  In full wars, it's paradoxical. It's more popular than ever. It's reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[2:58:18.180 --> 2:58:26.180]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of money.
[2:58:26.180 --> 2:58:38.180]  So listen, up to 75% off in FullWarsTour.com on things like amazing Patriot t-shirts that help spread the word and fund the operation on supplements, on books, on films.

[3:00:09.180 --> 3:00:29.180]  Transmuting worldwide from the summit.news.studios in the United Kingdom, you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:00:29.180 --> 3:00:38.180]  Your live is the summit news hour and in this hour we're going to cover a host of different topic course we had today.
[3:00:38.180 --> 3:00:48.180]  A report out of Bloomberg where Joe Biden is set to announce that the US will accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees.
[3:00:48.180 --> 3:00:57.180]  Now given that about a third of Ukrainian refugees arriving in countries like France aren't from Ukraine, that might pose a problem.
[3:00:57.180 --> 3:01:07.180]  Now they've done it according to the Bloomberg report at least partially in the name of protecting the LGBTQ community.
[3:01:07.180 --> 3:01:13.180]  We're going to check in on another report again in the next segment which I put up yesterday on that subject.
[3:01:13.180 --> 3:01:22.180]  Transgenders are fleeing Ukraine because they're getting to the border basically having their Adam's apples checked by the Ukrainian security forces.
[3:01:22.180 --> 3:01:32.180]  And not a very LGBT friendly country, in fact it's ranked in the bottom 10 when it comes to LGBT rights in Ukraine.
[3:01:32.180 --> 3:01:36.180]  Gay marriage is illegal, homosexuality is a sin.
[3:01:36.180 --> 3:01:44.180]  So these current thing supporters who've suddenly switched their allegiance from demanding everyone wear a mask and take a vaccine over to supporting Ukraine.
[3:01:44.180 --> 3:01:56.180]  Many of whom have both the Ukrainian flag in their Twitter bio with the LGBT rainbow flag when they learn about how Ukraine treats gay people and transgenders.
[3:01:56.180 --> 3:01:59.180]  They may have a quandary.
[3:01:59.180 --> 3:02:04.180]  Meanwhile, Danish PM says being a refugee is temporary.
[3:02:04.180 --> 3:02:10.180]  We're going to get into all that but first I want to get into this and this is going to take up the next segment as well by the looks of it.
[3:02:10.180 --> 3:02:24.180]  This idea of group think this idea that the flip was switched overnight from the same people who vitriolically denounced anyone who didn't take a vaccine vitriolically denounced anyone who didn't wear a mask.
[3:02:24.180 --> 3:02:34.180]  The same people now vitriolically denouncing people who don't fully support Ukraine, don't fully support the no fly zone, the escalation of the war agenda.
[3:02:34.180 --> 3:02:37.180]  Where does that thinking come from?
[3:02:37.180 --> 3:02:40.180]  Well, there were a couple of polls this week.
[3:02:40.180 --> 3:02:49.180]  First one headline poll vaccinated people far more likely to support risking World War three over Ukraine.
[3:02:49.180 --> 3:02:50.180]  Now think about it.
[3:02:50.180 --> 3:02:55.180]  These people for the past two years have been cowering inside their homes when they dare leave their homes.
[3:02:55.180 --> 3:02:58.180]  They've been wearing four or five face masks.
[3:02:58.180 --> 3:03:13.180]  They've had their third jab, some of them are now having their fourth jab, having lived in abject fear over the past two years of a virus which 99.7% of people depending on the age range survive.
[3:03:13.180 --> 3:03:20.180]  Even in the upper bracket age range, the vast, vast majority survive with no long term effects whatsoever.
[3:03:20.180 --> 3:03:30.180]  They've been terrified of that virus for the past two years, but now suddenly they're all gung ho about something which could literally cause nuclear Armageddon.
[3:03:30.180 --> 3:03:44.180]  A new poll finds that vaccinated people are far more likely to risk World War three over Ukraine by supporting aggressive measures against Russia while unvaccinated people are more likely to support diplomatic measures.
[3:03:44.180 --> 3:03:50.180]  This was a survey conducted in Canada published by the Toronto Star.
[3:03:50.180 --> 3:04:07.180]  The Canadians have received three or more shots massively supported expanding sanctions, 86%, seizing Russian assets, 85%, although now it's come out that Zelensky actually lobbied Roman Abramovich in the United Kingdom to not have his asset seized.
[3:04:07.180 --> 3:04:08.180]  That's interesting, isn't it?
[3:04:08.180 --> 3:04:14.180]  Cutting off shipments of Russian oil, 81% and sending additional military equipment to Ukraine, 82%.
[3:04:14.180 --> 3:04:24.180]  Then on the flip side, the unvaccinated, a majority of them, 52% said they did not support any of that.
[3:04:24.180 --> 3:04:41.180]  So again, this tribal ideological echo chamber has completely transferred over from lockdowns, mask wearing, mass vaccinations with the COVID pandemic to supporting the current thing in the context of the Ukraine war.
[3:04:41.180 --> 3:04:51.180]  I'm going to get into that further on the other side of the break and then we're going to ask the question, what is the danger of the United States accepting 100,000 Ukrainian refugees?
[3:04:51.180 --> 3:04:58.180]  We'll be right back.
[3:05:21.180 --> 3:05:32.180]  Now is the time in your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on your car or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain reaction.
[3:05:32.180 --> 3:05:34.180]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[3:05:34.180 --> 3:05:35.180]  I have a few ideas.
[3:05:35.180 --> 3:05:38.180]  First of all, health care is really important to a farm.
[3:05:38.180 --> 3:05:40.180]  A rest house, a rest house swap.
[3:05:40.180 --> 3:05:41.180]  The vaccine is poison.
[3:05:41.180 --> 3:05:42.180]  There's tons of things.
[3:05:42.180 --> 3:05:43.180]  I said, just keep it short, keep it concise.
[3:05:43.180 --> 3:05:44.180]  No, I agree.
[3:05:44.180 --> 3:05:47.180]  A rest house, a rest bill gates, the COVID backs is poison.
[3:05:47.180 --> 3:05:48.180]  Beautiful.
[3:05:48.180 --> 3:05:51.180]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved if we could all be affected.
[3:05:51.180 --> 3:05:52.180]  So that's what I'm calling about.
[3:05:52.180 --> 3:05:53.180]  God bless you, Chris.
[3:05:53.180 --> 3:05:56.180]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[3:05:56.180 --> 3:06:25.180]  Thank you so much.
[3:06:26.180 --> 3:06:37.180]  And we're back and we're talking about the group thing that seamlessly transferred over from the COVID lockdown, mask wearing, mass vaccination rhetoric.
[3:06:37.180 --> 3:06:47.180]  And again, the vitriolic denunciation of anyone who doesn't ideologically bend the knee to that rhetoric, to that narrative.
[3:06:47.180 --> 3:06:55.180]  Again, I was talking about before the break, this new poll out of Canada, which shows that there's an exact correlation between the people who supported
[3:06:55.180 --> 3:07:05.180]  the vaccination supported the lockdown supported the mask wearing and those who want to escalate the conflict in Ukraine.
[3:07:05.180 --> 3:07:09.180]  Chris Menahan comments on this from information liberation.
[3:07:09.180 --> 3:07:16.180]  The overwhelming majority probably would have said use diplomacy if it was an option, but the warhawks behind the poll left it off the list.
[3:07:16.180 --> 3:07:26.180]  But as I comment, the insightful poll results back up the claims of many that the COVID narrative was switched seamlessly to support Ukraine virtually overnight by the media.
[3:07:26.180 --> 3:07:30.180]  And the unthinking masses immediately displayed that their ideological subservient.
[3:07:30.180 --> 3:07:38.180]  I was walking in a village last week near where I live with probably a population of about 200 people max.
[3:07:38.180 --> 3:07:44.180]  And they'd advertised a coffee morning for old biddies to support Ukraine.
[3:07:44.180 --> 3:07:47.180]  Like I'm all for people getting together in the local community.
[3:07:47.180 --> 3:07:58.180]  But it's the fact that this is all we're already funneled through to some elderly people in a remote village that they need to go for a coffee in the morning to support you.
[3:07:58.180 --> 3:08:00.180]  How does that support Ukraine again?
[3:08:00.180 --> 3:08:04.180]  It's just you could put it on a poster and feel good about yourself.
[3:08:04.180 --> 3:08:17.180]  As I write, NPCs were able to seamlessly transfer from zealous support for vaccines and vitriolic denunciations of anyone who didn't get one to zealous support for Ukraine and vitriolic denunciations of anyone who didn't fully swallow the war narrative.
[3:08:17.180 --> 3:08:25.180]  It seems that mass support for whatever the current thing the political class and culture demands has become a form of cognitive addiction.
[3:08:25.180 --> 3:08:35.180]  And again, people have made this point because humanity, because people within their own communities have become increasingly atomized from each other.
[3:08:35.180 --> 3:08:38.180]  Their families are falling apart. They don't talk to their own families.
[3:08:38.180 --> 3:08:40.180]  They don't talk to their own parents or siblings.
[3:08:40.180 --> 3:08:42.180]  They don't talk to their own neighbors.
[3:08:42.180 --> 3:08:47.180]  Their life has no definition, no structure, no meaning.
[3:08:47.180 --> 3:09:04.180]  So that meaning is now dependent on their them identifying with lurching from one global crisis to another and then using that weaponizing that to give their own life meaning by engaging in this tribalist thinking,
[3:09:04.180 --> 3:09:12.180]  which allows them to ostracize publicly shame, deplatform, demonize anyone who isn't on the bandwagon.
[3:09:12.180 --> 3:09:28.180]  People seem to be so lost in terms of a lack of fulfillment, a lack of meaning within their own lives that they glom onto global crises and try to identify themselves that way, try to define their personality that way.
[3:09:28.180 --> 3:09:34.180]  And in fact, that was a point made by unheard in an article by Mary Harrington,
[3:09:34.180 --> 3:09:42.180]  headline the COVID cautious or hungriest for war, where she talks about this same poll that I just mentioned.
[3:09:42.180 --> 3:09:54.180]  And she makes the point that again, this atomization of society, this ability to not rely on local threads of your community has enabled this mass on questioning thinking.
[3:09:54.180 --> 3:10:00.180]  She writes, quote, humans have probably always clustered by belief to an extent.
[3:10:00.180 --> 3:10:09.180]  But it's been evidence since at least 2016 that social media greatly accelerates the intensity of this dynamic by unmooring it from material life.
[3:10:09.180 --> 3:10:17.180]  I can't very well cancel my local butcher if we disagree about vaccines or Ukraine, at least not if I want to buy a steak off him tomorrow.
[3:10:17.180 --> 3:10:23.180]  But if I do my grocery shopping online, I can demonize an expel to my heart's content.
[3:10:23.180 --> 3:10:33.180]  And again, because we become so unreliant on our own community on the other people around us, and we don't necessarily need them anymore,
[3:10:33.180 --> 3:10:41.180]  then we can ostracize ourselves from them, not just physically, not just socially, but also in a political sense.
[3:10:41.180 --> 3:10:51.180]  She continues, lockdown scale this up radically by forcing as much as possible of our common life away from in person interactions to the Internet,
[3:10:51.180 --> 3:10:53.180]  and again builds these echo chambers.
[3:10:53.180 --> 3:11:00.180]  Unsurprisingly, she continues, this has radically intensified ideological clustering and tribalization.
[3:11:00.180 --> 3:11:09.180]  Accordingly, since 2020, we've seen BLM emojis sweep over social media bios only to replace by or augmented by vaccine emojis,
[3:11:09.180 --> 3:11:13.180]  and more recently, with an effervescence of Ukrainian flags.
[3:11:13.180 --> 3:11:17.180]  And in fact, I saw yesterday on Twitter this lawyer.
[3:11:17.180 --> 3:11:26.180]  He posted something like, what would what would you do if you saw Tommy Robinson and Lawrence Fox in a ditch and you were bypassing a restaurant?
[3:11:26.180 --> 3:11:30.180]  And the answer was, oh, I checked what was on the menu.
[3:11:30.180 --> 3:11:37.180]  In his bio, he had the mask emoji, he had the vaccine emoji, and he had the Ukraine flag emoji.
[3:11:37.180 --> 3:11:42.180]  He's very keen on broadcasting what a good person he is to the world.
[3:11:42.180 --> 3:11:50.180]  While he simultaneously brags about how if he saw someone dying in a ditch because they disagree with him politically,
[3:11:50.180 --> 3:11:54.180]  he would walk by and let them die because he's a really nice person.
[3:11:54.180 --> 3:11:57.180]  He's got the flags in his bio.
[3:11:57.180 --> 3:11:59.180]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:11:59.180 --> 3:12:01.180]  They're the good people.
[3:12:01.180 --> 3:12:07.180]  And yet they constantly talk all day about how they want people who disagree with them to die horrible deaths, but they're the good people.
[3:12:07.180 --> 3:12:18.180]  And so we the baddies. Related story, polls support for further US involvement in Ukraine collapses when Americans told it risks war and economic hardship.
[3:12:18.180 --> 3:12:28.180]  But why do you have to be told that if you shoot down Russian planes over Ukraine with NATO jets, that's probably going to lead to World War Three?
[3:12:28.180 --> 3:12:30.180]  How do you not know that?
[3:12:30.180 --> 3:12:38.180]  We just said it over and over again. The UK government said it. The Biden administration said it multiple times.
[3:12:38.180 --> 3:12:43.180]  That's why they say they're not going to do it because it's going to lead to nuclear Armageddon.
[3:12:43.180 --> 3:12:50.180]  But when asked in polls if we should give substantial military aid in the form of military equipment to Ukraine,
[3:12:50.180 --> 3:12:55.180]  78% of Americans in this Fox News poll said yes.
[3:12:55.180 --> 3:13:04.180]  But when asked them or when you clarify when the authority figure in the form of the pollster clarifies that that would risk war with Russia,
[3:13:04.180 --> 3:13:08.180]  that 78% of Americans collapses to 36%.
[3:13:08.180 --> 3:13:11.180]  But again, why do you need to be told?
[3:13:11.180 --> 3:13:16.180]  Again, this is a complete lack of critical thinking skills within the population.
[3:13:16.180 --> 3:13:21.180]  They can't think one step beyond supporting the current thing.
[3:13:21.180 --> 3:13:27.180]  80% of Americans in this Fox News poll support further economic sanctions against Russia.
[3:13:27.180 --> 3:13:32.180]  But this number drops to just 44% when respondents include the proviso,
[3:13:32.180 --> 3:13:38.180]  that this will lead to, quote, higher prices and financial hardship for Americans.
[3:13:38.180 --> 3:13:47.180]  So again, they can't engage in a modicum of critical thinking to realize that if you slap sanctions on one of the biggest economic powers in the world,
[3:13:47.180 --> 3:13:54.180]  one of the biggest hoarders of energy in the world, Russia, that's going to have a knock on effect.
[3:13:54.180 --> 3:13:57.180]  It's the bread basket of Europe in many senses.
[3:13:57.180 --> 3:14:02.180]  That's why people, experts have said a massive food shortage crisis is coming.
[3:14:02.180 --> 3:14:06.180]  Food prices are already skyrocketing along with gasoline prices,
[3:14:06.180 --> 3:14:11.180]  because that's where a great portion of the food that feeds the world comes from.
[3:14:11.180 --> 3:14:17.180]  So why don't they know that when they answer the initial question, they support it?
[3:14:17.180 --> 3:14:20.180]  80% of Americans, again, support the economic sanctions.
[3:14:20.180 --> 3:14:26.180]  But when they're told, oh, by the way, you know, those economic sanctions against energy and food,
[3:14:26.180 --> 3:14:30.180]  that has a knock on effect to your wallet, to your paycheck.
[3:14:30.180 --> 3:14:33.180]  Oh, I didn't know that. How did you not know that?
[3:14:33.180 --> 3:14:41.180]  They have to be told by a pollster and then support for it collapses by a half or more.
[3:14:41.180 --> 3:14:42.180]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:14:42.180 --> 3:14:46.180]  But again, it goes back to supporting the current thing.
[3:14:46.180 --> 3:14:47.180]  They support the current thing.
[3:14:47.180 --> 3:14:51.180]  They put the Ukraine flag in their Twitter bio, and that's it.
[3:14:51.180 --> 3:14:55.180]  No critical thinking is required beyond that step.
[3:14:55.180 --> 3:14:56.180]  Now, people have pushed back.
[3:14:56.180 --> 3:15:01.180]  You'll remember Elon Musk posted a meme, which was posted by other people,
[3:15:01.180 --> 3:15:03.180]  but he drew massive attention to it.
[3:15:03.180 --> 3:15:06.180]  I support the current thing, this NPC meme.
[3:15:06.180 --> 3:15:10.180]  And people have pushed back against it by saying that people who say,
[3:15:10.180 --> 3:15:16.180]  I don't support the current thing are the exact engaging in the exact same mindset.
[3:15:16.180 --> 3:15:18.180]  No, that's completely untrue.
[3:15:18.180 --> 3:15:24.180]  It's not the same thing because supporting the current thing has no negative consequences whatsoever.
[3:15:24.180 --> 3:15:26.180]  You're rewarded with dopamine.
[3:15:26.180 --> 3:15:28.180]  You're rewarded by the establishment.
[3:15:28.180 --> 3:15:29.180]  Your job is an under threat.
[3:15:29.180 --> 3:15:35.180]  On the flip side, people who don't support the current thing face financial ruin,
[3:15:35.180 --> 3:15:39.180]  social ostracization, demonization, de-platforming,
[3:15:39.180 --> 3:15:44.180]  as we've seen over the past three or four weeks on numerous occasions once again.
[3:15:44.180 --> 3:15:51.180]  So no, not supporting the current thing isn't the same NPC-like behavior as I support the current thing
[3:15:51.180 --> 3:15:53.180]  with no critical thinking skills.
[3:15:53.180 --> 3:15:54.180]  We'll be back.

[3:19:24.180 --> 3:19:35.180]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[3:19:35.180 --> 3:19:44.180]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[3:19:44.180 --> 3:19:50.180]  It's reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.

[3:19:58.180 --> 3:20:08.180]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:08.180 --> 3:20:31.180]  Music playing
[3:20:31.180 --> 3:20:43.180]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:20:43.180 --> 3:20:52.180]  So again, as I mentioned before the break, that number in a Fox News poll, 80% of Americans who support further economic sanctions against Russia,
[3:20:52.180 --> 3:21:04.180]  when told that, yes, Russia and Ukraine, that area of the world is the bread basket for many areas of the world, that Russia controls a lot of energy, a lot of commodities,
[3:21:04.180 --> 3:21:12.180]  and that's going to make higher prices in America, that's going to make your food more expensive, your gasoline more expensive.
[3:21:12.180 --> 3:21:23.180]  When told that by an authority figure, the pollster, the support for sanctions on Russia drops by almost a half, but it's like, how could you not know that?
[3:21:23.180 --> 3:21:27.180]  This is what I'm talking about, this is that meme.
[3:21:27.180 --> 3:21:36.180]  I support the current thing, support the current thing, get the dopamine, get the high status symbol opinion, which gives you establishment approval,
[3:21:36.180 --> 3:21:44.180]  which protects you from being canceled, and beyond that, zero critical thinking is required.
[3:21:44.180 --> 3:21:54.180]  Again, I write in the article, this again underscores how people are so easily manipulated into supporting the current thing based on fleeting feelings of moral superiority,
[3:21:54.180 --> 3:21:59.180]  and wanting to follow the herd without even considering the long term consequences.
[3:21:59.180 --> 3:22:09.180]  Again, there was another poll last week, same thing, Yahoo News, Uyghur poll, plurality of Americans supported imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine,
[3:22:09.180 --> 3:22:17.180]  but then opposition to that doubled when respondents were told this would mean the US military shooting down Russian aircraft.
[3:22:17.180 --> 3:22:23.180]  How did you not know that? That's the very definition of a no-fly zone.
[3:22:23.180 --> 3:22:29.180]  What do you think it is? Just a kind word in the ear, please don't fly any planes over Ukraine.
[3:22:29.180 --> 3:22:36.180]  No, it's shooting down Russian fighters. It's nuclear Armageddon, it's World War III.
[3:22:36.180 --> 3:22:42.180]  Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah, because you can't think. You support the current thing.
[3:22:42.180 --> 3:22:53.180]  So again, the idea, and by the way, there's a counter meme now, which is the NPC and it says, I support, I don't support the current thing.
[3:22:53.180 --> 3:23:03.180]  And instead of transgender flags and Ukrainian flags, it's like infowars and arty in the background and like being against masks.
[3:23:03.180 --> 3:23:09.180]  No, that doesn't work because there's no negative consequences for supporting the current thing.
[3:23:09.180 --> 3:23:17.180]  Whereas if you don't support the current thing, you can end up out of a job, out of a bank account, or even worse.
[3:23:17.180 --> 3:23:19.180]  Another example of that today.
[3:23:19.180 --> 3:23:24.180]  British professor faces government crackdown for questioning Ukraine war narrative.
[3:23:24.180 --> 3:23:29.180]  Again, if he just have supported the current thing, he'd have been okay.
[3:23:29.180 --> 3:23:34.180]  Oh, but supporting the current thing and not supporting the current thing, that's ideologically similar.
[3:23:34.180 --> 3:23:39.180]  No, it isn't because there's no consequence for supporting the current thing.
[3:23:39.180 --> 3:23:44.180]  A professor at the University of Edinburgh is facing trial by media and a government crackdown.
[3:23:44.180 --> 3:23:53.180]  That's literally what the education minister said, merely because he shared an article questioning the narrative behind the bombing of a theater in the Ukrainian city of Maripole.
[3:23:53.180 --> 3:23:56.180]  Now, we've had the Snake Island hoax.
[3:23:56.180 --> 3:24:00.180]  We've had the Samhide ghost of Kiev hoax.
[3:24:00.180 --> 3:24:04.180]  We've had the fake bombing of a memorial in Kiev.
[3:24:04.180 --> 3:24:07.180]  We've had the fake attack on a nuclear facility.
[3:24:07.180 --> 3:24:15.180]  All complete bollocks never happened, totally contrived by the NATO powers, by the Ukrainian government.
[3:24:15.180 --> 3:24:21.180]  So why should anyone flippantly offhand just believe everything they say?
[3:24:21.180 --> 3:24:31.180]  Professor Tim Hayward is currently being cancelled, cancelled culture doesn't exist though, apparently, by the mob because he shared an article by left-wing news outlet Greyzone,
[3:24:31.180 --> 3:24:34.180]  which of course also featured in the back of that.
[3:24:34.180 --> 3:24:37.180]  I don't support the current thing, by the way.
[3:24:37.180 --> 3:24:39.180]  Apparently, that's a verbatim website.
[3:24:39.180 --> 3:24:46.180]  I'll have to check that one out, which suggested the theater bombing, blamed on Russia, may actually have been carried out by Ukrainian as-of fighters.
[3:24:46.180 --> 3:24:51.180]  What, the neo-Nazis? No, they're our neo-Nazis, they never do that.
[3:24:51.180 --> 3:24:57.180]  The incident was immediately exploited by NATO powers to justify more military support for Ukraine.
[3:24:57.180 --> 3:25:05.180]  However, the neo-Nazi unit is accused of using civilians as human shields inside the building before they blew it up.
[3:25:05.180 --> 3:25:15.180]  And Hayward, this university professor out of Scotland, merely pointed to the fact that there's no evidence of it being blown up by Russian missiles.
[3:25:15.180 --> 3:25:17.180]  Russia has denied attacking it.
[3:25:17.180 --> 3:25:23.180]  People have looked at this theater building and said it was of no strategic importance, so why would they attack it?
[3:25:23.180 --> 3:25:32.180]  But merely for asking those questions, this professor has been completely savaged, again, for not supporting the current thing,
[3:25:32.180 --> 3:25:41.180]  accused in a Times article of spreading Russian disinformation, which the ghost of Kiev being fake, the Holocaust attack being fake,
[3:25:41.180 --> 3:25:46.180]  the Snake Island being fake, that was all Russian disinformation at one time, wasn't it?
[3:25:46.180 --> 3:25:53.180]  He was called a useful idiot for President Putin's atrocities by a Tory MP in the House of Commons.
[3:25:53.180 --> 3:26:01.180]  The professor was also targeted by Education Secretary, former Vaccines Minister Nadeem Zahawi,
[3:26:01.180 --> 3:26:08.180]  good old British name, who said universities that challenged the official narrative would be investigated and professors harnished.
[3:26:08.180 --> 3:26:12.180]  Sounds awful like McCarthyism, doesn't it?
[3:26:12.180 --> 3:26:18.180]  Putin and his cronies are a malign influence on anyone in this country buying their false narrative,
[3:26:18.180 --> 3:26:23.180]  and after repeating its false and dangerous narrative, we will crack down on it hard, Zahawi said.
[3:26:23.180 --> 3:26:29.180]  And again, he was speaking in the context of this University of Edinburgh professor,
[3:26:29.180 --> 3:26:35.180]  who merely questioned the official narrative behind this theater attack.
[3:26:35.180 --> 3:26:39.180]  The professor himself gave a quote to a news outlet.
[3:26:39.180 --> 3:26:42.180]  He said, in war, miscalculations can have terrible consequences.
[3:26:42.180 --> 3:26:46.180]  We also know that misinformation can sometimes even slip through on our own side,
[3:26:46.180 --> 3:26:51.180]  as when the UK went to war in Iraq, mistakenly believing it had weapons of mass destruction.
[3:26:51.180 --> 3:26:54.180]  No, we don't talk about that anymore.
[3:26:54.180 --> 3:27:01.180]  We don't talk about how the legacy media for years religiously pushed the completely contrived fake story
[3:27:01.180 --> 3:27:10.180]  that al-Qaeda terrorists had links to Saddam Hussein in Iraq based on fake drunken sources.
[3:27:10.180 --> 3:27:13.180]  We don't talk about that anymore, do we? No.
[3:27:13.180 --> 3:27:18.180]  That's, again, back in the day that would have been, and it was, I remember,
[3:27:18.180 --> 3:27:23.180]  it would have been called Iraqi propaganda turned out to be completely true, of course.
[3:27:23.180 --> 3:27:29.180]  But again, he's facing not only cancellation, he's facing people in parliament standing up
[3:27:29.180 --> 3:27:34.180]  particularly calling him a Russian agent and calling for him to be not only dismissed,
[3:27:34.180 --> 3:27:42.180]  but all universities in the United Kingdom to be investigated for pushing Russian disinformation.
[3:27:42.180 --> 3:27:46.180]  Now, universities in the United Kingdom are pushing a lot of other bad stuff.
[3:27:46.180 --> 3:27:48.180]  Apparently, that's fine, though.
[3:27:48.180 --> 3:27:52.180]  Schools in the UK are pushing sex lessons for five-year-olds.
[3:27:52.180 --> 3:27:54.180]  Apparently, that's permissible.
[3:27:54.180 --> 3:27:56.180]  Don't worry about that.
[3:27:56.180 --> 3:28:02.180]  If you're questioned and attacked in a city in Ukraine, we have to go after him.
[3:28:02.180 --> 3:28:06.180]  On the flip side, we're going to get into this Bashar al-Assad clip because, again,
[3:28:06.180 --> 3:28:11.180]  we have Middle Eastern dictators basically laughing at us and saying what happened to the West
[3:28:11.180 --> 3:28:13.180]  triumphing free speech.
[3:28:13.180 --> 3:28:16.180]  That apparently doesn't exist anymore.
[3:28:16.180 --> 3:28:23.180]  And then we're also going to get into this secret plan to send 10,000 NATO peacekeeping troops into Ukraine.
[3:28:23.180 --> 3:28:28.180]  Not so secret given that it's all over the media and Poland has talked about it on numerous occasions.
[3:28:28.180 --> 3:28:34.180]  But Lavrov has shot back and said, again, that this will trigger direct war with Russia.
[3:28:34.180 --> 3:28:38.180]  But, again, as long as it's in furtherance of the current thing who cares.
[3:28:38.180 --> 3:28:41.180]  We're also going to talk about the refugee situation.
[3:28:41.180 --> 3:28:44.180]  100,000 Ukrainian refugees heading to America.
[3:28:44.180 --> 3:28:50.180]  We're going to describe the experiences of female Ukrainian refugees who entered Sweden
[3:28:50.180 --> 3:28:53.180]  and then said they want to go back to Ukraine.
[3:28:53.180 --> 3:29:22.180]  So make note, news will be back.
[3:29:24.180 --> 3:29:27.180]  You are totally dizzy and confused.
[3:29:27.180 --> 3:29:29.180]  You have a concussion.
[3:29:29.180 --> 3:29:30.180]  And that's what the globalists have done.
[3:29:30.180 --> 3:29:32.180]  They have stunned us.
[3:29:32.180 --> 3:29:35.180]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings.
[3:29:35.180 --> 3:29:39.180]  And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave him a speech he called The Great New Narrative,
[3:29:39.180 --> 3:29:41.180]  where he brags how the public is lost.
[3:29:41.180 --> 3:29:46.180]  How the culture in the media has been driven to make sure that people are all alone
[3:29:46.180 --> 3:29:49.180]  so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[3:29:49.180 --> 3:29:51.180]  That's what the great reset is.
[3:29:51.180 --> 3:29:53.180]  They need darkness to thrive.
[3:29:53.180 --> 3:30:22.180]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[3:30:22.180 --> 3:30:27.180]  Protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[3:30:27.180 --> 3:30:29.180]  That's why everybody should visit InfowarsStore.com.

[3:31:20.180 --> 3:31:23.180]  Super ingredients behind brain force culture include
[3:31:23.180 --> 3:31:27.180]  Oranaceae, which is loaded with energy compounds and antioxidants
[3:31:27.180 --> 3:31:31.180]  that have been used by Amazonian tribes for centuries.
[3:31:31.180 --> 3:31:36.180]  AlphaGPC, a natural compound found in the brain that delivers an essential nutrient,
[3:31:36.180 --> 3:31:41.180]  Koli, and Ginkoli, which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant content.
[3:31:41.180 --> 3:31:45.180]  This product is more than twice the servings of our Brain Force Plus as well,
[3:31:45.180 --> 3:31:47.180]  so you know it's packed full of the good stuff.

[3:32:29.180 --> 3:32:33.180]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[3:32:33.180 --> 3:32:37.180]  Infowars and Band-Aid video have become a mothership
[3:32:37.180 --> 3:32:40.180]  promoting the pro-human-liberty movement worldwide.
[3:32:40.180 --> 3:32:44.180]  But the expenses in Bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter,
[3:32:44.180 --> 3:32:47.180]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[3:32:47.180 --> 3:32:50.180]  So the biggest sale in Infowars history is going right now,
[3:32:50.180 --> 3:32:53.180]  an emergency blowout sale up to 75% off,
[3:32:53.180 --> 3:32:58.180]  getting incredible products and keeping Infowars as strong as ever.
[3:32:58.180 --> 3:33:03.180]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[3:33:03.180 --> 3:33:10.180]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:10.180 --> 3:33:21.180]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[3:33:21.180 --> 3:33:24.180]  Let's rattle through some of these video clips now
[3:33:24.180 --> 3:33:29.180]  because I think we've got about four or five to get through the next half an hour.
[3:33:29.180 --> 3:33:33.180]  I spoke before the break about this university professor in Scotland
[3:33:33.180 --> 3:33:37.180]  being cancelled merely for questioning or sharing a news article
[3:33:37.180 --> 3:33:43.180]  which questioned the narrative behind a Russian attack on a theatre in Maripole.
[3:33:43.180 --> 3:33:46.180]  Well, now, once again, we're being lectured in the West
[3:33:46.180 --> 3:33:49.180]  by third-world dictators about the fact that apparently
[3:33:49.180 --> 3:33:53.180]  we've completely abandoned our sanctity for free speech
[3:33:53.180 --> 3:33:57.180]  and we're now a laughing stock and we're not distinguished in any way
[3:33:57.180 --> 3:34:02.180]  in many senses from many of those autocratic countries in those parts of the world.
[3:34:02.180 --> 3:34:05.180]  This is Assad Bashar al-Assad.
[3:34:05.180 --> 3:34:09.180]  In Democratic West, you're only allowed one opinion. Here's the clip.
[3:34:09.180 --> 3:34:13.180]  Petty foreign dictators are once again laughing at the subversion
[3:34:13.180 --> 3:34:15.180]  and emasculation of the West.
[3:34:15.180 --> 3:34:18.180]  This time in the form of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,
[3:34:18.180 --> 3:34:22.180]  he questioned why the West continues to triumph, how democratic it is
[3:34:22.180 --> 3:34:37.180]  while insisting that everyone holds the exact same opinion about everything.
[3:34:52.180 --> 3:35:13.180]  Yeah, but isn't Assad just a dictator?
[3:35:13.180 --> 3:35:16.180]  What right does he have to lecture us about free speech?
[3:35:16.180 --> 3:35:18.180]  Yeah, I think you're asking the wrong question.
[3:35:18.180 --> 3:35:22.180]  The real question should be, why are Middle Eastern dictators laughing
[3:35:22.180 --> 3:35:25.180]  at the state of free speech in the West?
[3:35:25.180 --> 3:35:28.180]  Does that kind of suggest to you that we've abandoned the principles
[3:35:28.180 --> 3:35:32.180]  that once distinguished us from Middle Eastern dictatorships?
[3:35:32.180 --> 3:35:35.180]  Doesn't really matter if Assad is a hypocrite. He's right.
[3:35:35.180 --> 3:35:39.180]  And what of this monoculture of a loud opinion that Assad speaks of?
[3:35:39.180 --> 3:35:42.180]  Is diversity of thought an increasingly endangered concept in the West?
[3:35:42.180 --> 3:35:44.180]  Take this, for example.
[3:35:44.180 --> 3:35:48.180]  The polling firm in Canada compared the answers of fully vaccinated people
[3:35:48.180 --> 3:35:52.180]  to non-vaccinated people when it came to the situation in Ukraine.
[3:35:52.180 --> 3:35:54.180]  The results were staggering.
[3:35:54.180 --> 3:35:58.180]  Fully boosted people having been terrified of a virus for the past two years
[3:35:58.180 --> 3:36:03.180]  are the most aggressive when it comes to favouring risking World War III
[3:36:03.180 --> 3:36:07.180]  to face down Russia, while non-vaxxed people are far more likely
[3:36:07.180 --> 3:36:10.180]  to oppose such measures in favour of diplomacy.
[3:36:10.180 --> 3:36:14.180]  These insightful poll results back up an increasingly common claim.
[3:36:14.180 --> 3:36:19.180]  But when the entire COVID narrative was switched virtually overnight by the media too,
[3:36:19.180 --> 3:36:25.180]  to put Ukraine, the unthinking masses immediately displayed their ideological subservience.
[3:36:25.180 --> 3:36:31.180]  NPCs were able to seamlessly transfer from zealous support for vaccinations
[3:36:31.180 --> 3:36:34.180]  and vitriolic denunciations of anyone who didn't get one
[3:36:34.180 --> 3:36:38.180]  to zealous support for Ukraine and vitriolic denunciations of anyone
[3:36:38.180 --> 3:36:41.180]  who even dares suggest there might be some nuance
[3:36:41.180 --> 3:36:45.180]  or who doesn't fully swallow the war narrative of the regime.
[3:36:45.180 --> 3:36:51.180]  It seems mass unquestioning support for whatever current thing the political class and the culture demands
[3:36:51.180 --> 3:36:53.180]  has become a form of cognitive addiction.
[3:36:53.180 --> 3:36:58.180]  Having been completely atomised, humanity seems completely dependent on defining itself
[3:36:58.180 --> 3:37:01.180]  by lurching from one crisis to another
[3:37:01.180 --> 3:37:06.180]  and weaponising that crisis to ostracise publicly shame and deplatform dissidents
[3:37:06.180 --> 3:37:10.180]  who suggest that all may not be as it seems.
[3:37:12.180 --> 3:37:15.180]  Now I'm going to move on to this refugee situation
[3:37:15.180 --> 3:37:21.180]  in terms of this Biden plan to accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees into the United States.
[3:37:21.180 --> 3:37:25.180]  The exact wording in this Bloomberg article is very interesting.
[3:37:25.180 --> 3:37:29.180]  I'm going to talk about that, but first I'm going to play this video
[3:37:29.180 --> 3:37:35.180]  because they openly said that they want to help Ukrainian refugees to protect the LGBT movement.
[3:37:35.180 --> 3:37:39.180]  That's basically what this Bloomberg article said, which is very interesting
[3:37:39.180 --> 3:37:45.180]  because yesterday I made a video about transgenders trying to flee Ukraine.
[3:37:45.180 --> 3:37:50.180]  These are biological males who now claim they're women trying to flee the country
[3:37:50.180 --> 3:37:55.180]  presumably like the Titanic when the men dressed up as women and tried to get on the lifeboats.
[3:37:55.180 --> 3:38:01.180]  Unfortunately for them, Ukraine is not a very LGBT friendly country.
[3:38:01.180 --> 3:38:07.180]  Let's go to this clip. Transgenders fleeing Ukraine told their men by border guards.
[3:38:07.180 --> 3:38:08.180]  Here it is.
[3:38:08.180 --> 3:38:13.180]  Transgender women attempting to flee Ukraine are being turned back at the border
[3:38:13.180 --> 3:38:15.180]  and told to return home to fight.
[3:38:15.180 --> 3:38:19.180]  The reason, according to Ukrainian border guards, they're men.
[3:38:19.180 --> 3:38:21.180]  Sounds pretty transphobic to me.
[3:38:21.180 --> 3:38:24.180]  Under the state of martial law declared by President Zelensky,
[3:38:24.180 --> 3:38:28.180]  all biological males between the ages of 18 and 60
[3:38:28.180 --> 3:38:31.180]  are mandated to stay in the country and fight.
[3:38:31.180 --> 3:38:35.180]  The law makes no exception whatsoever for transwomen.
[3:38:35.180 --> 3:38:38.180]  A report by Italian newspaper Le Corrier de la Serre
[3:38:38.180 --> 3:38:42.180]  confirms that virtually all of the transgenders attempting to escape Ukraine by identifying as women
[3:38:42.180 --> 3:38:44.180]  have been apprehended and sent back.
[3:38:44.180 --> 3:38:48.180]  The report quotes one of the transwomen who was told by border guards,
[3:38:48.180 --> 3:38:51.180]  quote, they are men, they must turn back and fight.
[3:38:51.180 --> 3:38:55.180]  Another transwomen couple, both of whom were born biological males,
[3:38:55.180 --> 3:38:59.180]  had their Adams apples checked by Ukrainian officers.
[3:38:59.180 --> 3:39:03.180]  They were then told to return home and quote, go to the war.
[3:39:03.180 --> 3:39:07.180]  Another described the humiliating treatment meted out by Ukrainian border guards.
[3:39:07.180 --> 3:39:11.180]  Ukrainian border guards undress you and touch you everywhere, Judas says.
[3:39:11.180 --> 3:39:14.180]  You can see on their faces they're wondering, what are you?
[3:39:14.180 --> 3:39:16.180]  Like you're some kind of animal or something.
[3:39:16.180 --> 3:39:21.180]  That from someone who was born a biological female but now identifies as a man
[3:39:21.180 --> 3:39:24.180]  but was still prevented from fleeing the country.
[3:39:24.180 --> 3:39:27.180]  There is no reason why she should not be allowed to pass with the thousands of women
[3:39:27.180 --> 3:39:30.180]  who are crossing Ukrainian borders to safety every day.
[3:39:30.180 --> 3:39:33.180]  Yet on 12th of March at about 4 a.m. after a long and humiliating search,
[3:39:33.180 --> 3:39:38.180]  border guards determined she was a man and prevented her passage into Poland.
[3:39:38.180 --> 3:39:41.180]  According to Human Rights campaign or Alina Shepchenko,
[3:39:41.180 --> 3:39:44.180]  it sounds like Ukrainian border guards are preventing even trans people
[3:39:44.180 --> 3:39:48.180]  with a valid certificate reflecting their new gender from leaving Ukraine
[3:39:48.180 --> 3:39:50.180]  and nobody knows why.
[3:39:50.180 --> 3:39:54.180]  So Hedge reports, interestingly the American press didn't pick up the story.
[3:39:54.180 --> 3:39:59.180]  Could this be because it might undermine the bright, shiny, definitely not Nazi-ish
[3:39:59.180 --> 3:40:01.180]  new heroic image of the Ukrainian government,
[3:40:01.180 --> 3:40:06.180]  which has been the subject of almost unanimously positive coverage in the American press.
[3:40:06.180 --> 3:40:11.180]  According to the International Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans and Intersex Association,
[3:40:11.180 --> 3:40:16.180]  whatever that is, Ukraine ranks 39 out of 49 European countries
[3:40:16.180 --> 3:40:19.180]  when it comes to its treatment of LGBT people.
[3:40:19.180 --> 3:40:22.180]  Marriage is illegal and homosexuality is considered a sin,
[3:40:22.180 --> 3:40:25.180]  and there are no anti-LGBT discrimination laws.
[3:40:25.180 --> 3:40:31.180]  So technically all the moral exhibitionists who have put Ukrainian flags in their Twitter bios
[3:40:31.180 --> 3:40:36.180]  are supporting one of the most homophobic and transphobic countries on the entire continent.
[3:40:36.180 --> 3:40:39.180]  Imagine how scrambled their brains will be when they find that out.
[3:40:39.180 --> 3:40:45.180]  Which current thing do you support when one current thing totally contradicts the other?
[3:40:45.180 --> 3:40:51.180]  Now that's an interesting angle, the fact that these transgenders have been turned back
[3:40:51.180 --> 3:40:55.180]  by the apparently transphobic Ukrainian border guards.
[3:40:55.180 --> 3:40:58.180]  But again, we support the current thing, so we'll just ignore that for now.
[3:40:58.180 --> 3:41:02.180]  Because in this Bloomberg article today which announced that
[3:41:02.180 --> 3:41:06.180]  a Biden White House plan to accept 100,000 refugees into the United States,
[3:41:06.180 --> 3:41:12.180]  it said, quote, the official, who is quoted in this Bloomberg article,
[3:41:12.180 --> 3:41:17.180]  said the US is committed to protecting LGBTQ people,
[3:41:17.180 --> 3:41:22.180]  and those with medical needs that have been disrupted by war.
[3:41:22.180 --> 3:41:30.180]  Medical needs suggest transgenders, of course LGBTQ people includes those transgenders
[3:41:30.180 --> 3:41:33.180]  who are trying to flee the country but being turned back.
[3:41:33.180 --> 3:41:41.180]  So are they literally announcing this 100,000 refugee intake merely to help the rainbow people?
[3:41:41.180 --> 3:41:45.180]  What's also interesting about this, of course, as I've mentioned before,
[3:41:45.180 --> 3:41:52.180]  100,000 Ukrainian refugees, I will say many of these Ukrainian refugees are actually refugees,
[3:41:52.180 --> 3:41:55.180]  women and children, of course under martial law,
[3:41:55.180 --> 3:42:00.180]  Zelensky said men between the ages of 18 and 60 had to stay and fight.
[3:42:00.180 --> 3:42:04.180]  So a lot of the refugees, most of them at least coming into Europe,
[3:42:04.180 --> 3:42:07.180]  are actual refugees, they're women and children.
[3:42:07.180 --> 3:42:14.180]  The problem is though in France 30% of them on, we had this headline last week,
[3:42:14.180 --> 3:42:18.180]  30% of Ukrainian refugees are actually from other countries
[3:42:18.180 --> 3:42:22.180]  and that was based on a French Le Figaro newspaper report,
[3:42:22.180 --> 3:42:28.180]  which said that the newspaper revealed 7.5% are of Algerian nationality,
[3:42:28.180 --> 3:42:34.180]  that's not Ukraine, 3.5% of rivals are from Ivory Coast and Morocco respectively,
[3:42:34.180 --> 3:42:40.180]  and then the other countries you look at, Congo, Cameroon, Pakistan, Nigeria, India,
[3:42:40.180 --> 3:42:45.180]  they're not coming from Ukraine, 30% at least.
[3:42:45.180 --> 3:42:53.180]  So 100,000 as many as 30,000 will not be actual Ukrainians if it's similar to what's going on in France.
[3:42:53.180 --> 3:43:04.180]  And then of course they had...
[3:43:23.180 --> 3:43:27.180]  We've got great products, thousands of them at InfoWarsTour.com
[3:43:27.180 --> 3:43:30.180]  and we are funded by listeners and viewers like you
[3:43:30.180 --> 3:43:35.180]  and so now we need to support more than ever because this fight has intensified,
[3:43:35.180 --> 3:43:38.180]  don't need me to tell you that at InfoWarsTour.com.
[3:43:38.180 --> 3:43:42.180]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now,
[3:43:42.180 --> 3:43:45.180]  things have been sold out for a long time like InfoWarsLife,
[3:43:45.180 --> 3:43:51.180]  Fizzy Magnesium mix that's so amazing and our new immune support formula that's so critical,
[3:43:51.180 --> 3:43:56.180]  they're all available 25 to 75% off at InfoWarsTour.com right now.
[3:43:56.180 --> 3:44:03.180]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class,
[3:44:03.180 --> 3:44:09.180]  not in Communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[3:44:09.180 --> 3:44:13.180]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[3:44:13.180 --> 3:44:15.180]  And that's done by design.
[3:44:15.180 --> 3:44:20.180]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[3:44:20.180 --> 3:44:24.180]  that look in to say the Anglo-American establishment,
[3:44:24.180 --> 3:44:27.180]  the founder of the Bilderberg Group, the trilateral commission of the United Nations,
[3:44:27.180 --> 3:44:30.180]  the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[3:44:30.180 --> 3:44:36.180]  Until 10 years ago the media said the control corporate media of the Bilderberg Group didn't exist.
[3:44:36.180 --> 3:44:39.180]  Well now the Bilderberg Group is public in its former head,
[3:44:39.180 --> 3:44:45.180]  still on the steering committee, is called Schwab and he has set up the great reset in global government
[3:44:45.180 --> 3:44:50.180]  and if as a liberty movement worldwide we don't address the globalist head on
[3:44:50.180 --> 3:44:54.180]  about the fact that they are worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[3:44:54.180 --> 3:44:56.180]  If you expose them we can beat them easily.
[3:44:56.180 --> 3:45:05.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWarsTour.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history
[3:45:05.180 --> 3:45:09.180]  and that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding,
[3:45:09.180 --> 3:45:11.180]  the supply chains have broken down
[3:45:11.180 --> 3:45:17.180]  and InfoWars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for operations
[3:45:17.180 --> 3:45:22.180]  and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making their main move.
[3:45:22.180 --> 3:45:28.180]  InfoWars, its paradoxical is more popular than ever, it is reaching more people than ever despite the censorship
[3:45:28.180 --> 3:45:33.180]  but because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure, pay for our own bandwidth, everything else,
[3:45:33.180 --> 3:45:36.180]  we are running out of money.
[3:45:36.180 --> 3:45:42.180]  It is reaching up to 75% off InfoWarsTour.com on things like amazing Patriot t-shirts
[3:45:42.180 --> 3:45:47.180]  that helps spread the word and fund the operation, on supplements, on books, on films,
[3:45:47.180 --> 3:45:54.180]  everything is 25-75% off right now, the biggest sell in our history at InfoWarsTour.com.
[3:45:54.180 --> 3:46:07.180]  Thank you for your support.
[3:46:24.180 --> 3:46:50.180]  Thank you.
[3:46:50.180 --> 3:46:53.800]  why it's hard to share him Full Wars links and Bandai video links.
[3:46:53.800 --> 3:46:56.300]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[3:46:56.300 --> 3:47:25.500]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:25.500 --> 3:47:31.100]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:47:31.100 --> 3:47:40.020]  So as I was talking about before the break we've got cut off, the U.S. is set to announce
[3:47:40.020 --> 3:47:46.420]  a program to accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees in the name of, according to the official
[3:47:46.420 --> 3:47:53.500]  quoted by Bloomberg, protecting LGBTQ people and those with medical needs that have been
[3:47:53.500 --> 3:47:55.340]  disrupted by war.
[3:47:55.340 --> 3:48:02.100]  So that will include presumably the transgender's biological men who identify as women attempting
[3:48:02.100 --> 3:48:07.380]  to flee Ukraine but being turned back at the border by the transphobic Ukrainian border
[3:48:07.380 --> 3:48:13.140]  guards who are checking their Adam's apple and saying they need to go back home and fight
[3:48:13.140 --> 3:48:15.740]  on the front lines basically.
[3:48:15.740 --> 3:48:21.620]  Now another part of this Bloomberg article said, quote, given the United States will
[3:48:21.620 --> 3:48:28.500]  have to accept these refugees 100,000, quote, over the course of several years.
[3:48:28.500 --> 3:48:33.500]  Now that's interesting because the Prime Minister of Denmark made the point yesterday
[3:48:33.500 --> 3:48:38.740]  that quote being a refugee is temporary and that is the headline.
[3:48:38.740 --> 3:48:43.740]  This is Danish Prime Minister, Metta Frederiksen, who made the comments after Denmark passed
[3:48:43.740 --> 3:48:48.860]  a law giving Ukrainian refugees the right to work, education and social welfare.
[3:48:48.860 --> 3:48:54.860]  But she's basically said, when the war stops, that tat will be turned off, quote, being
[3:48:54.860 --> 3:48:56.780]  a refugee is temporary.
[3:48:56.780 --> 3:49:00.780]  So you have to return and help build up your homeland when you get the opportunity.
[3:49:00.780 --> 3:49:05.540]  It gives us the opportunity to help other refugees and again, that's the point.
[3:49:05.540 --> 3:49:11.420]  When 30% of the quote Ukrainian refugees coming into France on Ukrainian refugees aren't
[3:49:11.420 --> 3:49:18.140]  women and children, they're male economic migrants from India, Pakistan, and other
[3:49:18.140 --> 3:49:20.940]  North African Middle Eastern countries.
[3:49:20.940 --> 3:49:26.140]  That disadvantages actual female and children Ukrainian refugees.
[3:49:26.140 --> 3:49:32.820]  And of course, Denmark was the first country in Europe to demand that quote Syrian refugees
[3:49:32.820 --> 3:49:38.020]  again, many of whom were economic male migrants who came from Afghanistan, Pakistan and all
[3:49:38.020 --> 3:49:45.700]  these parts of the world would have to return home once the Syrian civil war ended.
[3:49:45.700 --> 3:49:49.900]  When you had this other comment from Denmark's former immigration minister, Inga Stolberg,
[3:49:49.900 --> 3:49:54.260]  who said, quote, no one dares to say it like it is.
[3:49:54.260 --> 3:49:58.860]  It's because the Ukrainians are more like us and because they are primarily Christians
[3:49:58.860 --> 3:50:04.300]  as to why European countries such as Poland, which of course accepted virtually zero refugees
[3:50:04.300 --> 3:50:11.620]  during the 2015, 16 refugee crisis, which was actually exploited by a majority of economic
[3:50:11.620 --> 3:50:13.120]  migrants.
[3:50:13.120 --> 3:50:18.900]  And they are swinging open the borders, opening their arms to Ukrainian refugees because again,
[3:50:18.900 --> 3:50:23.500]  the majority of them at least are actual refugees, women and children.
[3:50:23.500 --> 3:50:28.900]  But then you have these male economic migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and these other
[3:50:28.900 --> 3:50:35.780]  countries, which are exploiting that wave once again to slip into the continent of Europe.
[3:50:35.780 --> 3:50:40.620]  Now again, on an individual level, the vast majority of them, I don't blame them.
[3:50:40.620 --> 3:50:45.060]  If I lived in an S-hole country in the Middle East, I would want to go to Denmark.
[3:50:45.060 --> 3:50:46.620]  It's pretty nice.
[3:50:46.620 --> 3:50:49.420]  Problem is where fall and they don't integrate.
[3:50:49.420 --> 3:50:51.340]  And that's the best of the situation.
[3:50:51.340 --> 3:50:56.860]  The worst of the situation is they exploit the refugee wave to carry out mass casualty
[3:50:56.860 --> 3:51:03.580]  terrorist attacks as happened in Paris, where the majority of the Paris jihadists snuck
[3:51:03.580 --> 3:51:11.220]  into Europe via the refugee wave, and then we had multiple numerous attacks where refugees
[3:51:11.220 --> 3:51:16.700]  quote refugees who were actually jihadists exploited that wave to slip into Europe undetected
[3:51:16.700 --> 3:51:19.860]  on fake papers to carry out terrorist attacks.
[3:51:19.860 --> 3:51:23.320]  I've talked about that until I was blue in the face.
[3:51:23.320 --> 3:51:29.580]  So yes, there is a danger when you accept 100,000 people over a short amount of time
[3:51:29.580 --> 3:51:35.140]  and don't vet them properly, which I'm sure the open borders Biden administration won't
[3:51:35.140 --> 3:51:42.780]  whatsoever, that there's a danger both in terms of security and in terms of integration.
[3:51:42.780 --> 3:51:48.340]  But there's another problem that actual refugees are having coming from Ukraine into supposedly
[3:51:48.340 --> 3:51:51.980]  tolerant liberal Western European countries.
[3:51:51.980 --> 3:51:56.380]  And that is the problem of multiculturalism and diversity.
[3:51:56.380 --> 3:52:02.300]  And that was the unfortunate experience of some female Ukrainian refugees who encountered
[3:52:02.300 --> 3:52:04.700]  Swedish multiculturalism.
[3:52:04.700 --> 3:52:06.060]  And we have a clip on that.
[3:52:06.060 --> 3:52:08.140]  And here it is.
[3:52:08.140 --> 3:52:12.780]  Having escaped the Russian war machine, female Ukrainian refugees are facing a new threat
[3:52:12.780 --> 3:52:14.780]  to their safety.
[3:52:14.780 --> 3:52:15.780]  Multicultural Sweden.
[3:52:15.780 --> 3:52:16.940]  Wait, but diversity is a strength.
[3:52:16.940 --> 3:52:17.940]  No.
[3:52:17.940 --> 3:52:21.620]  Well, not if you're one of several Ukrainian women staying at a refugee hostel in Orebry.
[3:52:21.620 --> 3:52:27.340]  Speaking to news outlets, Samit and Swedish public radio, the Ukrainian refugees described
[3:52:27.340 --> 3:52:28.340]  what happened.
[3:52:28.340 --> 3:52:33.780]  Gangs of foreign migrants later identified as Somalis attempted to break into the hostel
[3:52:33.780 --> 3:52:36.820]  rooms where the Ukrainian women were staying with their young children.
[3:52:36.820 --> 3:52:40.940]  The first incident occurred at 3 a.m. when two Somali men started knocking on the front
[3:52:40.940 --> 3:52:42.300]  door of the hostel.
[3:52:42.300 --> 3:52:45.580]  Without opening the door, the Ukrainian women tried to talk to the men outside.
[3:52:45.580 --> 3:52:50.380]  They looked like African Americans if I express myself politely, one woman told the news outlet.
[3:52:50.380 --> 3:52:53.180]  They were black people, tall and slim with black skin colour.
[3:52:53.180 --> 3:52:57.060]  She explained to the men that only Ukrainian women and children live in the hostel, but
[3:52:57.060 --> 3:52:59.980]  the Somalis claimed that they have a friend who lives there.
[3:52:59.980 --> 3:53:03.500]  After asking what their friend's name was, the Ukrainian women figured out no person
[3:53:03.500 --> 3:53:05.500]  with that name was residing at the hostel.
[3:53:05.500 --> 3:53:09.300]  They started knocking on the door of a woman who lives with her two small children, aged
[3:53:09.300 --> 3:53:10.300]  two and four.
[3:53:10.300 --> 3:53:13.220]  They were very scared, the volunteer said of the children.
[3:53:13.220 --> 3:53:16.620]  The four-year-old was silent, but the two-year-old screamed, she added.
[3:53:16.620 --> 3:53:21.940]  At 5 a.m., a group reportedly of Arab origin arrived at the premises and attempted unsuccessfully
[3:53:21.940 --> 3:53:22.940]  to enter the hostel.
[3:53:22.940 --> 3:53:23.940]  What's the problem?
[3:53:23.940 --> 3:53:28.780]  They were just trying to find their friend at 5 a.m. by breaking into a room full of
[3:53:28.780 --> 3:53:29.780]  young women.
[3:53:29.780 --> 3:53:31.780]  I'm sure they only had the best intentions.
[3:53:31.780 --> 3:53:35.940]  The women said they were afraid to report what happened to the police and the hostel
[3:53:35.940 --> 3:53:39.020]  had to employ a bunch of new security guards.
[3:53:39.020 --> 3:53:44.460]  I don't want to live here because I am afraid one of the female refugees told Swedish radio.
[3:53:44.460 --> 3:53:48.740]  They said that Sweden was a safe country, but I have not seen that said another.
[3:53:48.740 --> 3:53:52.660]  Yeah, the media will tell you that, but the facts will tell you that having been ranked
[3:53:52.660 --> 3:53:59.220]  as the safest country in Europe just 20 years ago, Sweden is now the second most dangerous.
[3:53:59.220 --> 3:54:01.460]  Because diversity is a strength.
[3:54:01.460 --> 3:54:06.340]  If by strength you mean gang rapes, grenade attacks and no-go zones so dangerous that they
[3:54:06.340 --> 3:54:09.860]  don't even deliver the mail there, then yeah, it's really a strength.
[3:54:09.860 --> 3:54:12.540]  Maybe these women can go to Germany instead.
[3:54:12.540 --> 3:54:15.100]  Oh, well, maybe not.
[3:54:15.100 --> 3:54:20.460]  A volunteer at the hostel says the women are so terrified they want to go back to Ukraine.
[3:54:20.460 --> 3:54:25.020]  Apparently the threat of missile strikes and bombs raining down on their heads is more
[3:54:25.020 --> 3:54:32.460]  appealing than the wondrous benefits of multicultural Sweden.
[3:54:32.460 --> 3:54:37.900]  Now on the same subject of the wondrous benefits of multiculturalism, of course we had a sexual
[3:54:37.900 --> 3:54:44.060]  grooming scandal in one town alone in the United Kingdom, it's happened in numerous towns across
[3:54:44.060 --> 3:54:46.300]  the country for decades.
[3:54:46.300 --> 3:54:52.820]  That was the town of Rotherham, where for the best part of two decades, young white English
[3:54:52.820 --> 3:54:59.420]  girls were industrially groomed and passed around predominantly Muslim Pakistani men.
[3:54:59.420 --> 3:55:03.100]  People complained about it, they complained to the council, they complained to the authorities.
[3:55:03.100 --> 3:55:07.060]  They were told to shut up and stop being racist.
[3:55:07.060 --> 3:55:11.940]  When this ties into a narrative that I've tried to explain many times over, political
[3:55:11.940 --> 3:55:15.660]  correctness isn't just being nice to people.
[3:55:15.660 --> 3:55:19.340]  It literally leads to widespread abuse and even death.
[3:55:19.340 --> 3:55:25.820]  We saw the trial of the Manchester Arena bomber back a few months ago where numerous
[3:55:25.820 --> 3:55:30.980]  people before he set off his bombs, which killed multiple children at the Manchester
[3:55:30.980 --> 3:55:38.820]  Arena in 2017, people were reporting his suspicious activity, those people were told to shut up
[3:55:38.820 --> 3:55:43.780]  and stop being racist, then the bomb went off and 20 odd people died, hundreds were
[3:55:43.780 --> 3:55:47.100]  maimed and injured because of political correctness.
[3:55:47.100 --> 3:55:52.300]  Breitbart reports grooming gang whistleblower claims police said she was being racist and
[3:55:52.300 --> 3:55:55.380]  quote rocking the multicultural bone.
[3:55:55.380 --> 3:56:00.260]  Again, this is in Rotherham, town right next door to Sheffield where I used to live where
[3:56:00.260 --> 3:56:01.260]  I was born.
[3:56:01.260 --> 3:56:05.100]  A child sexual abuse whistleblower has claimed she faced repeated efforts from the police
[3:56:05.100 --> 3:56:10.180]  to discourage her from reporting grooming gang activity in Rotherham.
[3:56:10.180 --> 3:56:15.900]  This is Jane senior MBE, who's a key witness in exposing the predominantly Pakistani grooming
[3:56:15.900 --> 3:56:21.060]  gang crisis across the north of England claims to have faced opposition from the police who
[3:56:21.060 --> 3:56:24.980]  were allegedly attempted to dissuade her from passing on key evidence.
[3:56:24.980 --> 3:56:29.580]  Remember in some of these situations, the fathers of the abused children will literally
[3:56:29.580 --> 3:56:34.420]  show up at the houses where their kids are being sexually abused, call the police.
[3:56:34.420 --> 3:56:40.580]  The police will turn up and say, shut up, you're being racist, that actually happened.
[3:56:40.580 --> 3:56:45.740]  Continues, the whistleblower who has made complaints against more than 30 officers claimed
[3:56:45.740 --> 3:56:51.020]  a police misconduct hearing in Sheffield that she was told in one meeting with police officers.
[3:56:51.020 --> 3:56:57.820]  She was quote being racist was quote going against the perpetrators human rights again.
[3:56:57.820 --> 3:57:03.020]  They were passing around and sexually abusing kids, but they're human rights are more important
[3:57:03.020 --> 3:57:07.100]  apparently, and was quote rocking the multicultural boat.
[3:57:07.100 --> 3:57:13.500]  So yet more evidence of this grand cover up that happened in Rotherham happened in numerous
[3:57:13.500 --> 3:57:18.300]  other towns and cities throughout the United Kingdom, because local councils and local
[3:57:18.300 --> 3:57:24.980]  police officers thought it was more important to not be called racist than to protect and
[3:57:24.980 --> 3:57:31.100]  prosecute, to protect the children and to prosecute the vile individuals who were involved
[3:57:31.100 --> 3:57:36.820]  in this industrial grooming scandal, simply because they were Muslim and they were brown,
[3:57:36.820 --> 3:57:41.740]  and those authorities didn't want to be called racist, political correct correctness kills.
[3:57:41.740 --> 3:57:46.860]  War Room is next, summit dot news, now going.
[3:57:46.860 --> 3:57:51.500]  The eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans, they financed
[3:57:51.500 --> 3:57:57.340]  major universities, they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda
[3:57:57.340 --> 3:58:02.860]  of the New York Times, other major newspapers, that the family as we know it is a bad thing
[3:58:02.860 --> 3:58:03.860]  and must be ended.
[3:58:03.860 --> 3:58:09.620]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household teaching women that cooking
[3:58:09.620 --> 3:58:14.260]  dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing, and I was just
[3:58:14.260 --> 3:58:18.620]  sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four national daughter, my wife
[3:58:18.620 --> 3:58:22.500]  makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well, I love to make breakfast,
[3:58:22.500 --> 3:58:27.180]  and literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurturative
[3:58:27.180 --> 3:58:32.300]  and then all sit down together and have the communal event, and that's what the system
[3:58:32.300 --> 3:58:37.740]  is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions and coming together.
[3:58:37.740 --> 3:58:43.340]  They really are a sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that will domesticate us and turn
[3:58:43.340 --> 3:58:44.340]  us into lab rats.
[3:58:44.340 --> 3:58:46.900]  We cannot let this continue.
[3:58:46.900 --> 3:58:56.540]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the chains
[3:58:56.540 --> 3:59:00.940]  that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations has put
[3:59:00.940 --> 3:59:01.940]  in place.
[3:59:01.940 --> 3:59:07.460]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[3:59:07.460 --> 3:59:12.940]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[3:59:12.940 --> 3:59:15.860]  faces from the light of the sun.
[3:59:15.860 --> 3:59:24.020]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[3:59:24.020 --> 3:59:28.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[3:59:28.420 --> 3:59:31.260]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[3:59:31.260 --> 3:59:35.340]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[3:59:35.340 --> 3:59:37.340]  the World ID and Carbon Taxes.
[3:59:37.340 --> 3:59:40.340]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[3:59:40.340 --> 3:59:43.780]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[3:59:43.780 --> 3:59:53.700]  Non-compliance, non-compliance, non-compliance.
