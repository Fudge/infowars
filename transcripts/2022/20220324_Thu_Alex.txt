[00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.853]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the right place.
[00:00:09.513 --> 00:00:11.214]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:13.717 --> 00:00:20.581]  The elite's minions within the inept court system are bungling the best laid plans of the perverse and crooked establishment.
[00:00:20.781 --> 00:00:34.150]  And so it goes amongst the New York elite who are now in yet another panic after a list of alleged clients of the student prostitute in the Sarah Lawrence sex cult case was inadvertently published online.
[00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:45.718]  We're back covering the shocking allegations against Lawrence Ray, a 60-year-old dad accused of starting a sex cult with his daughter's college classmates after getting out of prison.
[00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:53.864]  He's now facing claims that he subjected his alleged victims to sexual and psychological manipulation and physical abuse.
[00:00:54.524 --> 00:00:59.225]   But long before these sex cult accusations came to light, Lawrence was a well-connected
[00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:04.123]   world traveler whose friends included former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Karik,
[00:01:04.123 --> 00:01:05.123]  who joins us now.
[00:01:05.123 --> 00:01:14.125]   And to give you an idea, Doc, of the, you know, the spectrum of people that he was around,
[00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:16.004]  he called me up from an airplane one time.
[00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:18.604]  And he said, "Pick me up at JFK.
[00:01:18.604 --> 00:01:19.604]  I'm coming into JFK.
[00:01:19.604 --> 00:01:21.644]  I've got some friends."
[00:01:21.644 --> 00:01:27.563]   And as he got off the plane and he was walking toward my car, I'm looking out the window,
[00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:35.751]  And I said, wow, I said, this guy that he's walking with, he really looks like President Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
[00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:39.313]  And he puts Mikhail Gorbachev in the backseat of my car.
[00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:47.878]  Another time, he picks up the phone in my car, he calls the Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, General James Jones.
[00:01:47.938 --> 00:01:59.609]  Another time, he invites me to a private dinner, and I walk in, and it's him, Governor Mario Cuomo, and Senator Robert Torselli of New Jersey.
[00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:03.712]  Just as quickly as the list was under seal, it was released.
[00:02:03.912 --> 00:02:14.019]  A mad attempt to undo the damage was ongoing, but unfortunately for them, the Daily Mail acquired a copy of the 121 names that only scraped the surface.
[00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:29.430]  According to the Daily Mail, the now-released document is an exhibit admitted in the federal case against 62-year-old Larry Ray, who is charged with operating a sex cult out of his daughter's dorm room at Sarah Lawrence College.
[00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:39.701]  After years of allegations about unspeakable abuse against young people he met as college students, 60-year-old Lawrence Ray was arrested at this New Jersey home on Tuesday.
[00:02:40.122 --> 00:02:44.026]  One of his daughter's roommates and one of the female victims in the indictment.
[00:02:44.707 --> 00:02:45.967]  We're in the residence at the time.
[00:02:46.347 --> 00:02:55.590]  According to the indictment, Ray held so-called therapy sessions in his daughter's dorm, alienating several of the victims from their parents after earning their trust.
[00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:05.293]  The document says he controlled them by using verbal and physical abuse, which escalated after he and some of the victims later moved to New York City.
[00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:13.358]  The indictment also charges Ray with depriving his victims of food and sleep, and taking explicit pictures of some of them.
[00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:23.005]  Prosecutors say he accused them of lying and stealing, and in response they say he asked for money, eventually extorting nearly a million dollars.
[00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:26.606]  Ray directed his victims to obtain money for him by other means.
[00:03:27.366 --> 00:03:32.888]  By draining their parents' savings, and worse, forced labor and prostitution.
[00:03:33.288 --> 00:03:39.529]  Ray is also accused of demanding taped confessions from his victims for supposed crimes they committed.
[00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.450]  Are you making this by your own free will?
[00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.990]  Yes.
[00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:51.855]  In this video uploaded in 2017, an apparently disoriented young woman says she tried to poison Ray, an unsubstantiated allegation.
[00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:53.516]  Did you in fact poison me?
[00:03:53.797 --> 00:03:54.237]  Yes, sir.
[00:03:54.677 --> 00:04:00.780]  Among the Johns on the list are a top executive at the Gap clothing firm and her husband.
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.842]  They were one of two married couples that were included.
[00:04:04.162 --> 00:04:08.144]  A former New York State Supreme Court judge is also named.
[00:04:08.424 --> 00:04:14.327]  Another alleged client is a painter who has studios in Manhattan's East Village and in Italy.
[00:04:14.528 --> 00:04:18.910]  A third, an architect famous for designing colleges and university buildings.
[00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.633]  An investment executive who was also a pedophile in Jeffrey Epstein's infamous Little Black Book of Contacts.
[00:04:25.893 --> 00:04:33.017]  Other names include a hedge fund manager who has his name on a museum on a building in New York, a Washington D.C.
[00:04:33.097 --> 00:04:35.978]  lobbyist, and an international diamond dealer.
[00:04:36.238 --> 00:04:44.660]  Also included is an executive at the Metropolitan Transit Authority, an account executive at Amazon, and a veteran travel writer.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:52.102]  Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Keith Raniere, Allison Mack, Peter Nygaard, and now Larry Ray.
[00:04:52.362 --> 00:04:58.823]  They will all merely be replaced to supply the debauched elite with the flesh for their fantasy lifestyle.
[00:04:59.063 --> 00:05:04.125]  Meanwhile, they continue to pervert our own children with their demonic policies.
[00:05:04.365 --> 00:05:11.365]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:05:11.365 --> 00:05:16.925]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday edition.
[00:05:17.631 --> 00:05:19.853]  When I say live, Owen Troyer is live in the studio.
[00:05:20.493 --> 00:05:25.858]  I am taping this in the morning from my home before I go and get some more medical tests.
[00:05:26.198 --> 00:05:26.298]  I'm 48.
[00:05:26.738 --> 00:05:28.099]  I'm under a lot of stress.
[00:05:29.415 --> 00:05:38.960]  And Dr. Marble was in the studio as a guest on other issues on Monday and saw some signs of some concerning things.
[00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:46.858]   check me out with a stethoscope and blood pressure machine and so that he thought I should go get checked out
[00:05:46.858 --> 00:05:48.219]  by a doctor.
[00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:53.819]   And so the soonest I could get into a clinic versus checking myself into the emergency room
[00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:56.698]  would have been Wednesday morning.
[00:05:56.698 --> 00:06:01.218]   And not thinking it would be a big deal, I just had my lawyers contact them and say,
[00:06:01.218 --> 00:06:02.759]  hey, we probably need to move this deposition.
[00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:09.058]   They've moved depositions on us, dates and times, at least five times that we can document.
[00:06:09.058 --> 00:06:12.479]  And so it's really not that big a deal.
[00:06:12.876 --> 00:06:15.998]  I've already sat three times for depositions in the Sandy Hook case.
[00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:19.201]  We've given them over 300,000 pages of documents.
[00:06:20.021 --> 00:06:23.143]  Uh, they got all our financial records, everything for a defamation case.
[00:06:24.224 --> 00:06:37.333]  And so when you see my financials on the news, when you, when you see all the depositions will be on the news and then you see that I've been defaulted, excuse me, when you see that I've been defaulted saying I gave them nothing, it's all a lie.
[00:06:38.345 --> 00:06:39.506]  These are show trials.
[00:06:39.686 --> 00:06:40.707]  These are staged events.
[00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:44.150]  But I intend to sit for the deposition, the fourth one.
[00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:57.900]  I intend to fight, even though I'm in a court case in Connecticut and Texas with three different cases, two in Texas, one in Connecticut, where I've been found guilty by the judges.
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:05.566]  Now, every American, even if they have a low IQ, knows you're innocent until proven guilty, and the judges don't find you guilty.
[00:07:06.547 --> 00:07:07.427]  Default judgments.
[00:07:08.436 --> 00:07:20.403]  Or when somebody never shows up one time, or never shows up to court, or doesn't file papers, or gets caught filing fraudulent documents, and even then you get sanctioned with lesser sanctions.
[00:07:21.043 --> 00:07:25.906]  We have been fed into the Democratic Party process by political judges.
[00:07:26.786 --> 00:07:27.627]  Take Travis County.
[00:07:28.667 --> 00:07:32.990]  They indicted Rick Perry years ago, the governor, when he vetoed a bill.
[00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.551]  That's in the state constitution.
[00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:36.152]  He's allowed to veto a bill.
[00:07:37.113 --> 00:07:44.855]  And I'll go to the whole story about the county attorney got caught super drunk, spitting and attacking police like a demon with a spit bag over her head.
[00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:50.436]  And she ran the Texas Anti-Corruption Commission that under state law is given all this money.
[00:07:50.496 --> 00:07:58.258]  So Perry said, if you don't remove her, I'm going to veto the tens of millions of dollars that go to it.
[00:07:59.321 --> 00:08:00.822]  They wouldn't remove her, so he vetoed it.
[00:08:00.862 --> 00:08:01.423]  They indicted him.
[00:08:01.463 --> 00:08:03.664]  He had to spend $2 million and three years fighting it.
[00:08:03.764 --> 00:08:05.426]  You can go look up interviews where he talks about it.
[00:08:05.446 --> 00:08:07.847]  This is the same scuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:08.528 --> 00:08:24.300]  They picked a few things I talked about years ago out of context, made me the Sandy Hook man, and now when we go to court, literally, the judges are primping with their mirrors and their makeup, and they're micing them up and micing up the lawyers and the BBC and HBO.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:31.446]  And all the Netflix are there, and then they get up and say, he's getting rich off Sandy Hooks.
[00:08:31.866 --> 00:08:34.708]  He's, he made his whole career off of it.
[00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:40.113]  As the New York Times writer says, buy my book, buy my book, it just came out in time for the trial.
[00:08:40.433 --> 00:08:40.974]  Buy my book.
[00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:44.437]  Everything they say about me is who they are.
[00:08:45.581 --> 00:08:50.365]  And the groups around Sandy Hook tragedy have brought in hundreds of millions of dollars of donations.
[00:08:50.966 --> 00:08:54.308]  Some of the people involved rake in up to a million a year themselves personally.
[00:08:55.329 --> 00:08:59.072]  And when we go to trial, all that's coming out one way or another.
[00:08:59.613 --> 00:09:02.775]  These judges that aren't judges think they can contain this and control all this.
[00:09:03.456 --> 00:09:11.082]  It's going to be their Waterloo because America knows how corrupt and out of control the system is.
[00:09:11.142 --> 00:09:17.593]   So look, My health issues are my issues, and they're private, and they're protected by HIPAA.
[00:09:18.694 --> 00:09:39.387]  And, I mean, you saw this judge up in Connecticut yesterday, and you saw the lawyers, these Democrat Party lawyers that work for Blumenthal, openly saying, we want him arrested and put in jail if he doesn't show up for some multi-day long, the way Connecticut law works, it's just unlimited long deal.
[00:09:39.427 --> 00:09:41.509]  And so when I talked to these doctors, they said, you're crazy.
[00:09:42.475 --> 00:09:48.818]  You need to go home, you need to go get these tests, I got more tests set today, more tomorrow, and you need to stay away from the microphone.
[00:09:48.838 --> 00:10:02.123]  Well, here I am, even though I shouldn't be on here because I have to respond to the hundreds of news articles, including the Associated Press, that are attacking me and saying I'm a horrible person.
[00:10:02.403 --> 00:10:06.045]  But I guess, I mean, I might just release my medical records and make you all look like fools.
[00:10:07.265 --> 00:10:09.506]  I mean, I've had EKGs, I've had scans, I've had it all.
[00:10:11.601 --> 00:10:15.084]  I started getting sick after I got COVID last year, almost killed my dad.
[00:10:16.065 --> 00:10:18.887]  And I took care of them and it was really bad Delta variant.
[00:10:19.488 --> 00:10:24.332]  And I got spike protein and like everybody else, it attacked my cardiovascular system.
[00:10:24.372 --> 00:10:24.612]  Okay.
[00:10:25.653 --> 00:10:38.284]  And so again, somebody on death row is allowed to go get their medical treatment and hearings and things are postponed, but I'm treated worse than somebody on death row.
[00:10:39.326 --> 00:10:41.407]  And so we've got all this huge Russia-Ukraine news.
[00:10:41.948 --> 00:10:49.753]  We've got all this, you know, middle schools locking the doors with fences around them to march the kids around as captives of the whole Lepus agenda.
[00:10:50.093 --> 00:10:54.356]  And then for weeks on end, everything is LGBT, sexual indoctrination.
[00:10:54.996 --> 00:10:58.998]  We've got serious stuff to be talking about here.
[00:11:00.199 --> 00:11:03.841]  And I'm literally, quite frankly, was looking forward to these depositions.
[00:11:04.302 --> 00:11:05.963]  So I was going to chew this Chris Manning guy out.
[00:11:08.436 --> 00:11:12.081]  Then they're like, you're crazy if you go do your normal 10, 12, 14 hour work days.
[00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:12.622]  You can't do it.
[00:11:13.303 --> 00:11:16.807]  And so I got some more tests coming up today and tomorrow.
[00:11:17.028 --> 00:11:18.930]  I'm going to get those knocked out and I should be fine.
[00:11:19.912 --> 00:11:22.335]  But I might have to go on some medication or whatever.
[00:11:22.355 --> 00:11:23.657]  And it's just the stress of this world.
[00:11:23.957 --> 00:11:24.518]  I really care.
[00:11:25.179 --> 00:11:31.771]   And I've never really Made any bones about that, but again, they want me arrested?
[00:11:32.312 --> 00:11:45.418]  When that's not even in the law to have another state's judge hold somebody in contempt in a civil case and then have someone arrested until they sit in front of the former federal prosecutor that set up the innocent governor of Connecticut and sent him to prison.
[00:11:46.118 --> 00:11:47.059]  I mean, that's who these people are.
[00:11:47.099 --> 00:11:47.980]  They want me in jail.
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:48.861]  They want me silenced.
[00:11:49.521 --> 00:11:51.643]  They want you silenced.
[00:11:51.903 --> 00:11:53.705]  And so many of these articles are completely wrong.
[00:11:54.065 --> 00:11:57.308]  Jones was ordered to be in a deposition, but he was on air Tuesday.
[00:11:57.769 --> 00:11:59.370]  The depositions were Wednesday and Thursday.
[00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.690]  Jones was at his studios doing the show on Wednesday.
[00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.570]  No, I wasn't in the studios doing it.
[00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.370]  In fact, I wasn't on the phone.
[00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:14.250]   I recorded it sitting here on my couch at home on an iPhone and sent it to him, just like I'm sending this
[00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.451]  at eight in the morning to my crew.
[00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:22.810]   And I'm gonna try to just forget about all this and turn the computer off and all of it
[00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.610]  and just try to take care of myself.
[00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.770]  And yeah, sorry, leftist.
[00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:34.449]   My health comes before you and your plan to become famous off my name and to steal my identity
[00:12:34.449 --> 00:12:36.170]  and to say I'm the Sandy Hook man.
[00:12:35.886 --> 00:12:37.107]  You're the Sandy Hook people.
[00:12:37.207 --> 00:12:39.728]  You eat, drink, sleep, and everything.
[00:12:39.748 --> 00:12:47.751]  If that's what you do, I will continue to question any big event, because a lot of times they're staged, like the Gulf of Tonkin, Jesse Smollett, WND's in Iraq.
[00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:56.531]  The list goes on and on, but you guys are the ones that dredge this up and misrepresent what I've said over and over again, and it's disgusting.
[00:12:56.912 --> 00:13:06.542]  So you guys can move your depositions, you guys can do whatever you want, however you want, whenever you want, and then after all these depositions, all these things I've done, you turn around and say that I have not.
[00:13:10.265 --> 00:13:13.948]  You say that I have, you know, oh I'm hiding and all this crap.
[00:13:14.368 --> 00:13:15.809]  Everybody knows Alex Jones doesn't hide.
[00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:18.431]  Everybody knows Alex Jones is on the front lines of this situation.
[00:13:19.051 --> 00:13:20.412]  And I appreciate the listeners supporting us.
[00:13:20.972 --> 00:13:26.336]  We intend to battle all these kangaroo court operations, but it takes money to hire the lawyers to do it.
[00:13:26.376 --> 00:13:30.639]  So please continue to support us at infowarestore.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:13:30.659 --> 00:13:32.681]  Also our other great sponsors have a lot of great products.
[00:13:36.684 --> 00:13:38.305]  Well, that's basically for everybody that tuned in today.
[00:13:38.325 --> 00:13:39.346]  I want to know where Alex Jones is.
[00:13:39.386 --> 00:13:39.766]  That's it.
[00:13:40.727 --> 00:13:43.709]  And, uh, you know, like I said, they want me arrested.
[00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:45.690]  And again, they tell you I'm defaulted.
[00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:46.611]  I'm already guilty.
[00:13:47.491 --> 00:13:50.173]  Well, then why am I having to testify if I'm guilty?
[00:13:50.454 --> 00:13:52.675]  And again, I'm happy to go do that.
[00:13:52.735 --> 00:13:55.477]  It's just that this isn't the time for me to be doing that.
[00:13:55.697 --> 00:13:56.898]  And they got to move deposition.
[00:13:56.938 --> 00:14:00.120]  So I am as good as these people are.
[00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:01.421]  I have rights.
[00:14:01.441 --> 00:14:02.422]  I have a first amendment.
[00:14:03.533 --> 00:14:05.875]  And I have a right to my medical life.
[00:14:06.916 --> 00:14:08.097]  And I'm sorry you don't like that.
[00:14:08.117 --> 00:14:10.699]  I know all over the world they're taking conservatives and Christians' health care away.
[00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:12.600]  The left is with a social credit score.
[00:14:13.041 --> 00:14:17.364]  These people are dangerous authoritarians and they know it and they're going to be defeated.
[00:14:17.744 --> 00:14:20.707]  All right, back to Owen Schroeder and the live broadcast.
[00:14:20.807 --> 00:14:23.529]  Infowars.com, the front lines of human liberty.
[00:14:23.549 --> 00:14:25.690]  Do you have any toad on you right now?
[00:14:26.051 --> 00:14:26.611]  No, I haven't.
[00:14:27.052 --> 00:14:28.853]  But I guess I'm tomorrow if you stay open.
[00:14:31.827 --> 00:14:33.528]  Oh my goodness, this is insane.
[00:14:34.529 --> 00:14:39.672]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer taking over now here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:44.551]  and let me just tell ya, it's just absolutely crazy.
[00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:48.810]  (laughing)
[00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.531]  I'm sorry.
[00:14:51.858 --> 00:14:55.160]  If you just knew what goes on behind the scenes here, I mean, it's just insane.
[00:14:58.742 --> 00:15:00.623]  Folks, nobody can do it like InfoWars, though.
[00:15:00.744 --> 00:15:01.304]  I'll tell you that.
[00:15:02.208 --> 00:15:04.430]  Nobody could do it like InfoWars.
[00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:05.071]  And you know what?
[00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:13.118]  Someday this will all be behind us and we'll probably write books and there'll be documentaries and it's just the whole shock and awe factor of it.
[00:15:13.219 --> 00:15:24.749]  But I have to somehow clear my mind of all that, clear my mind of all the legal stuff I've been dealing with all morning as I just sit right down in this chair and get ready to cover all of this news.
[00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:36.950]   But let me just tell you folks, have you ever heard the story of Mike the Durable?
[00:15:36.982 --> 00:15:38.443]  I was telling this to the crew the other day.
[00:15:40.543 --> 00:15:45.064]  There's this ancient folklore of Mike the Durable.
[00:15:45.084 --> 00:16:29.261]   Apparently it's a true story, maybe it's been exaggerated over time, but there's actual legal documents because there was criminal charges involved in the murder of this man, Mike the Durable, where, I believe it was the 1920s or 1930s, this old Irishman who was homeless and was just a total alcoholic boozehound and I guess back in the day you could take out a life insurance policy on somebody and didn't even matter if they were poor or rich and you would get a payout if they died and so this group of people and guys you can plug it in Mike the Durable into a search engine you'll find all the stories and the legal records and so these these crooks
[00:16:30.523 --> 00:16:43.587]  He took out a life insurance policy on Mike the Durable because he was this homeless booze hound that basically every day would drink until he passed out.
[00:16:44.507 --> 00:16:45.627]  And that was basically all he would do.
[00:16:45.667 --> 00:16:56.350]  He'd live on the street and he'd frequent these four or five bars that were owned by these whatever they called the booze dealers at the time.
[00:17:00.017 --> 00:17:04.300]  And they decided, hey, let's give this guy free drinks.
[00:17:04.461 --> 00:17:12.027]  We'll take out a life insurance policy and we'll tell this guy he can drink for free at our bars and he'll drink himself to death and we'll all get a couple thousand bucks payout.
[00:17:12.767 --> 00:17:16.870]  They say it was maybe between $60,000 and $100,000 a person for this life insurance policy.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.781]  So they tried to give him... I'll make the story short.
[00:17:20.801 --> 00:17:23.462]  Basically, they tried to drink him to death, wouldn't die.
[00:17:23.742 --> 00:17:26.643]  They tried poisoning him with all this different stuff.
[00:17:27.023 --> 00:17:28.863]  I mean, the guy literally drank poison.
[00:17:29.043 --> 00:17:30.184]  Rat poison, everything.
[00:17:30.944 --> 00:17:37.786]  And no matter what, Mike the Durable would show up the next day begging for a drink.
[00:17:39.875 --> 00:17:49.218]  They poisoned his drink, they made him drink antifreeze, rat poison, they'd strip him naked, throw him in the cold freezing snow and negative temperatures.
[00:17:49.638 --> 00:17:55.000]  They put tacks into sandwiches and made him eat nails.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:02.382]  I mean, they tried for months to kill this guy, Mike the Durable, and they could never do it.
[00:18:03.362 --> 00:18:11.591]   And so in the end, because they couldn't kill this guy, And make it look like an accident because he was an alcoholic homeless guy.
[00:18:12.712 --> 00:18:15.835]  Eventually they just took him to one of the guy's apartments and they just murdered him.
[00:18:17.156 --> 00:18:19.638]  And they got caught and they went to jail.
[00:18:19.738 --> 00:18:20.739]  One guy got the death penalty.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.223]  It's just crazy ancient folklore of American history.
[00:18:27.485 --> 00:18:30.848]  But that's like the story of InfoWars, folks.
[00:18:31.872 --> 00:18:43.197]  They have poisoned our water, they have poisoned our food, they have made us drink formaldehyde, they've made us eat tacks, they've thrown us in the freezing cold and dumped water over on us hoping we'll die.
[00:18:44.138 --> 00:18:45.418]  They pushed Mike the Durable!
[00:18:45.618 --> 00:18:47.739]  They paid a guy to run him over with a car!
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.000]  He survived that!
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:50.561]  I mean, literally, this story is crazy.
[00:18:50.841 --> 00:18:55.363]  My point is... We're like Mike the Durable here.
[00:18:58.604 --> 00:19:06.525]  Except it's not about some unbelievable Irish strength or something to drink a bunch of booze or have a stomach like a garbage disposal or whatever.
[00:19:07.726 --> 00:19:18.608]  It's you in the audience supporting us, praying for us, sharing the links that has made us Mike the Durable, except InfoWars the Durable.
[00:19:19.448 --> 00:19:20.388]  So why do I tell you that?
[00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:25.169]  Folks, they plan on InfoWars being long dead by now.
[00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:29.066]  They did not expect us to still be on air here today.
[00:19:29.147 --> 00:19:32.188]  They did not expect Alex Jones to still be operating InfoWars.
[00:19:33.369 --> 00:19:35.410]  And yet, here we are.
[00:19:37.211 --> 00:19:46.856]  And so, it's almost like they're getting to the point at the end of the Mike the Durable story where they're just going to take us to the back alley and just, you know, shiv us to death.
[00:19:47.857 --> 00:19:49.638]  Because we were supposed to be dead by now and we're not.
[00:19:51.482 --> 00:20:00.304]  But this is just me kind of clearing the air because I've just been in and out of meetings all morning and then I had to rush in here and get all my prep work done for the show.
[00:20:01.844 --> 00:20:06.505]  But I just want you to know, we're like already past our expiration date.
[00:20:06.545 --> 00:20:07.605]  We're already a miracle.
[00:20:07.685 --> 00:20:09.186]  We're already the Cinderella story.
[00:20:09.486 --> 00:20:10.806]  We're already Mike the Durable.
[00:20:12.686 --> 00:20:14.967]  And they are just so ticked off.
[00:20:16.138 --> 00:20:21.663]  The enemies of this transmission, they are just so ticked off, folks, you just have no idea.
[00:20:23.244 --> 00:20:34.073]  And, it is some personal stuff, it's some personal stuff for Alex Jones, but it's more importantly, this whole operation, the crew, the audience, and everything we've done up to this point.
[00:20:35.674 --> 00:20:37.376]  In the end, they did kill Mike Durable.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:48.361]   But I'm telling you, If it wasn't for your support at Infowarsstore.com, we would not be here.
[00:20:48.401 --> 00:20:51.762]  And I'm not going to get into some of the stuff that's happened here today.
[00:20:52.382 --> 00:20:55.503]  If Alex wants to break that news later on, he can.
[00:20:56.664 --> 00:21:02.206]  But folks, I mean, they're throwing everything they can to try to get this place shut down.
[00:21:04.026 --> 00:21:09.268]  And we just, just like Mike the Durable, showed up every day to have that free alcohol.
[00:21:09.849 --> 00:21:13.190]  We just keep showing up and going live.
[00:21:17.065 --> 00:21:19.807]  So, it's an honor to be here with you today.
[00:21:21.348 --> 00:21:22.309]  You're all part of this.
[00:21:22.649 --> 00:21:25.071]  Every day on air is a victory for free speech now.
[00:21:26.592 --> 00:21:28.053]  And I've said it before, I'll say it again.
[00:21:29.934 --> 00:21:38.581]  The fate of InfoWars and the fate of this transmission will ultimately be the fate of free speech in America.
[00:21:41.483 --> 00:21:46.947]   And you've already seen With the test case of Alex Jones and InfoWars and the censorship.
[00:21:48.027 --> 00:21:49.728]  And now everything they've done since then.
[00:21:50.129 --> 00:21:51.309]  Censoring President Trump.
[00:21:51.509 --> 00:21:52.890]  Censoring the President of Brazil.
[00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:56.772]  Censoring any commentator that doesn't say men or women.
[00:21:58.033 --> 00:22:00.474]  Censoring people that don't support the mask or the vaccines.
[00:22:00.855 --> 00:22:01.795]  Censoring doctors.
[00:22:02.355 --> 00:22:03.536]  Censoring members of Congress.
[00:22:03.816 --> 00:22:04.417]  You've seen it all.
[00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:06.638]  What was the test case?
[00:22:08.619 --> 00:22:10.320]  InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[00:22:11.946 --> 00:22:20.241]  And so if they can completely annihilate us from the free speech market, that will then be the test case and the proof that they can do it to anybody.
[00:22:23.945 --> 00:22:24.565]  I've said that.
[00:22:24.926 --> 00:22:27.407]  I'm going to urge you to support us at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:23:03.993 --> 00:23:10.098]  Alright, let me kinda hit the reset button here and properly lay out what we have coming up.
[00:23:11.779 --> 00:23:20.106]  We don't have any guests today on the Alex Jones Show, but I have the stacks and stacks of news in front of me.
[00:23:21.089 --> 00:23:24.532]  So let me tell you what we're going to be covering.
[00:23:27.154 --> 00:23:42.927]  This is the case every day now where I have a stack of news on my desk involving the grooming of young children at elementary schools and grade schools and high schools.
[00:23:44.448 --> 00:23:55.362]   And even last night, I'm at the gym And I'm playing basketball and there's a couple of high school kids up there and a couple of college kids.
[00:23:56.343 --> 00:24:00.785]  And then me and my buddies are just, you know, talking politics and we know what's going on.
[00:24:00.845 --> 00:24:06.887]  And some of these college kids are listening to us and they're just basically just aghast.
[00:24:07.187 --> 00:24:09.188]  They're like, how can you even talk like that?
[00:24:09.208 --> 00:24:10.969]  And we're like, this is what's going on, man.
[00:24:11.629 --> 00:24:13.710]  Like, sorry to bring you up to reality here.
[00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:14.850]  This is the big boy world.
[00:24:16.231 --> 00:24:19.612]  And we start talking about the grooming in the schools.
[00:24:22.011 --> 00:24:28.934]  And this one individual who's college-age doesn't believe it.
[00:24:29.074 --> 00:24:30.815]  He's like, this is not going on.
[00:24:30.835 --> 00:24:31.856]  They're not grooming the kids.
[00:24:31.876 --> 00:24:33.676]  They're not doing gay pride parades for kids.
[00:24:33.696 --> 00:24:34.317]  Like, come on.
[00:24:34.737 --> 00:24:35.717]  Like, you guys are crazy.
[00:24:36.198 --> 00:24:47.763]  And it just so happens, and I don't want to give out too much information here, but it just so happens that one of the individuals went to a high school where they were doing the Pride Week this week.
[00:24:49.770 --> 00:25:00.295]  He's like, yeah, this is actually going on, and then here's the list of all the gay things they sent out for us at the beginning of the week.
[00:25:00.455 --> 00:25:05.137]  And this college kid is not uninformed.
[00:25:05.157 --> 00:25:06.557]  I mean, he was actually a pretty smart kid.
[00:25:06.577 --> 00:25:07.978]  He just had no idea all this was going on.
[00:25:08.658 --> 00:25:13.100]  And he's just like, I mean, red-pilling in real time.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.521]  Now, I don't really like to do that.
[00:25:15.865 --> 00:25:40.499]   When I'm at the gym that's kind of an escapism thing for me and I'm already recognized by half the people there and they want to talk to me and it's all good I'm just saying I don't really like doing that but I mean this why am I making a big deal of this folks this is the type of thing that no matter what your politics are as long as you're not a radical leftist A radical communist?
[00:25:40.759 --> 00:25:42.581]  A just full-on brainwashed zombie?
[00:25:43.441 --> 00:26:14.093]   This is the kind of stuff that is going to make people wake up and realize what's going on and I mean you can choose strategically to attach this to the left or you can let them figure that out for themselves but let me just tell you the average person that doesn't really know what's going on because they don't really immerse themselves in the day-to-day politics or the cultural politics When they see this stuff, it's a shock and awe factor.
[00:26:14.833 --> 00:26:28.136]  And so, what I'm saying is, every day now, I have a stack of news on my desk that's all about how the school system is grooming children, grooming them sexually.
[00:26:28.156 --> 00:26:37.638]  I mean, quite honestly, the best comparison to be made here is Epstein Island and Epstein's sex slaves.
[00:26:40.185 --> 00:26:46.208]  And I understand there's a lot of arguments and counterpoints you can make, but really at a base level, is it not the same thing?
[00:26:47.628 --> 00:26:52.891]  Epstein grooming little girls and women into being sex slaves, grooming them into that?
[00:26:53.471 --> 00:26:56.492]  Is this not what they're doing in the schools with these kids?
[00:26:57.133 --> 00:26:59.134]  Grooming them to be sexual deviants?
[00:27:00.514 --> 00:27:01.515]  What would you call it?
[00:27:02.615 --> 00:27:24.546]   What would you call it when I have a document here, and it's, well, I should say I have Multiple documents here of states, multiple states, where they're teaching pre-pubescent students all about anal sex and masturbation and sex toys and everything else that you can imagine.
[00:27:26.347 --> 00:27:27.727]  Pre-pubescent kids.
[00:27:29.848 --> 00:27:39.191]  Kids that should be, the biggest concern should be if they scrape their knee climbing a fence or climbing a tree or riding a bike or getting home in time for dinner.
[00:27:40.503 --> 00:27:47.587]  You know, maybe scraping up a couple bucks so you can go down the street to the local convenience store and get a candy bar or a soda pop or something.
[00:27:48.807 --> 00:27:53.230]  Whatever the latest trend is for games for kids, a video game or a card game.
[00:27:54.230 --> 00:28:03.916]  No, now it's learn how to have gay sex and learn about all the different sexual kinks before you even hit puberty.
[00:28:03.956 --> 00:28:07.237]  Folks, that is grooming.
[00:28:08.978 --> 00:28:09.999]  So I've got a stack of that news.
[00:28:11.854 --> 00:28:14.415]  You've got the government illegally spying on its citizens.
[00:28:14.495 --> 00:28:16.835]  Remember, James Clapper lied about all that.
[00:28:17.256 --> 00:28:23.057]  Not just spying on journalists, which we all assume they do, we now know it, it's triple, quadruple confirmed.
[00:28:23.797 --> 00:28:26.758]  Also, with DNA databases.
[00:28:27.418 --> 00:28:27.619]  Hmm.
[00:28:29.019 --> 00:28:39.502]  Oh, and then remember, they said, you got a PCR test, a lot of you just submitted your DNA to a data bank unwittingly.
[00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:42.930]  Remember that little nugget they admitted?
[00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:46.232]  It's like, oh yeah, you got the nose swab, we collected your DNA.
[00:28:46.612 --> 00:28:47.012]  Really?
[00:28:48.533 --> 00:28:49.773]  Did you sign off on that?
[00:28:49.974 --> 00:28:51.574]  No, but they did it anyway!
[00:28:55.176 --> 00:28:59.458]  We've got some political news as apparently Biden is going to Europe.
[00:29:00.499 --> 00:29:04.881]  I don't know if anybody's seen Biden since they put out that fake picture on Twitter yesterday.
[00:29:06.004 --> 00:29:09.386]  Yes, the White House got caught putting up a fake picture on Twitter.
[00:29:09.987 --> 00:29:14.230]  Or, I should say, I guess it was a real picture, but from a long time ago.
[00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:21.534]  And they say, here's Biden going to Europe, and they post a picture from last year, or two years ago, or who even knows when.
[00:29:22.295 --> 00:29:23.276]  They didn't get away with that.
[00:29:25.217 --> 00:29:30.040]  Really, the biggest story is this one that's right in front of me here with the graph.
[00:29:31.621 --> 00:29:32.442]  And this is just...
[00:29:35.237 --> 00:29:44.779]  Adding on to the pile of evidence, or adding on to the data that we have, I mean, are we at the point of it's the cherry on top yet?
[00:29:44.899 --> 00:29:46.620]  Is it the bow on top yet?
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:30:00.443]  The latest data out of Canada totally proves, ladies and gentlemen, 90% of COVID deaths are vaccinated individuals.
[00:30:01.543 --> 00:30:02.183]  Let me repeat.
[00:30:03.339 --> 00:30:11.102]  The latest data out of Canada, 90% of COVID deaths are vaccinated individuals.
[00:30:13.123 --> 00:30:18.144]  90% of COVID deaths are vaccinated individuals.
[00:30:18.164 --> 00:30:20.665]  90% of COVID deaths are vaccinated individuals.
[00:30:20.945 --> 00:30:24.367]  Do you get it yet?
[00:30:24.387 --> 00:30:27.268]  90% of COVID deaths happen in hospitals.
[00:30:29.188 --> 00:30:30.689]  It's actually probably more than that.
[00:30:31.854 --> 00:30:33.315]  But I think you get the gist of it.
[00:30:34.577 --> 00:30:46.188]  So we'll be covering that, not to mention how now all these countries that were the most tyrannical when it came to the mask and vaccine mandates, oh, now all of a sudden they're just, oh, never mind!
[00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:56.181]   Oh, so you put people through all that torment, all that torture, And then you just say, never mind, which, again, is a good thing.
[00:30:56.661 --> 00:31:10.750]  You shouldn't be making people take a forced experimental medical procedure, and you shouldn't be forcing people to wear a face muzzle, but it's funny how you just say, okay, never mind, and it's just, oh, oh, yay, they tortured us all these years in this back.
[00:31:12.151 --> 00:31:19.536]  And what is going on where Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Jen Psaki all get COVID in the same week?
[00:31:20.176 --> 00:31:21.557]  Were they all at an event together?
[00:31:21.617 --> 00:31:22.518]  What event was that?
[00:31:23.877 --> 00:31:30.663]  But whether or not there's something there or not, they're all vaccinated and they say, oh, thank you for the vaccine.
[00:31:30.723 --> 00:31:36.708]  I've got COVID for the second time in six months, but that just shows the vaccine is working.
[00:31:37.688 --> 00:31:38.089]  Really?
[00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:40.611]  Interesting.
[00:31:42.653 --> 00:31:44.754]  What happened to that winner of death, by the way?
[00:31:45.995 --> 00:31:50.359]  Me and my entire crew are supposed to be dead, according to Joe Biden, because we didn't get the vaccine.
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:52.481]  That didn't happen.
[00:31:53.618 --> 00:31:57.924]  We do have the final day of the Judge Jackson hearing going on right now.
[00:31:58.184 --> 00:31:58.925]  Boy, oh boy.
[00:31:58.946 --> 00:32:03.292]  I mean, they're gonna confirm this pedophile-protecting judge, no doubt.
[00:32:04.728 --> 00:32:27.022]  I would say the odds are, but man oh man, is this going to be, this is by far the most embarrassing moment in the United States Supreme Court history will be when Judge Jackson gets confirmed, a pedophile protecting judge, and even maybe worse than that, just a low IQ nitwit who's only gotten to where she's at because of her skin color, literally.
[00:32:27.262 --> 00:32:32.026]  Back here live on the Alex Jones Show, brought to you by you!
[00:32:32.627 --> 00:32:34.689]  Shopping at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:34.749 --> 00:32:48.942]  The big story for me today, and here's the problem, the vaccine stuff, the COVID stuff, the mask stuff, all the medical tyranny, all the medical fascism, it really has been put in the rear view.
[00:32:50.157 --> 00:32:55.840]  And so there's no closure on who made the weaponized virus in a biological warfare lab.
[00:32:56.321 --> 00:33:04.005]  There's no closure on all the things that were done to us in the process in the last two years by our government.
[00:33:04.705 --> 00:33:12.390]  Destroying the economy, destroying the supply chain, destroying people's morale, psychology, the torture with the face masks and everything else.
[00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:14.251]  There's no closure, there's no justice there.
[00:33:14.671 --> 00:33:16.352]  It just gets to be in the rear view now.
[00:33:18.174 --> 00:33:32.804]  And we're just so relieved that we're not dealing with it anymore that we just kind of let it fade off into the distance, when really we should be bringing it back to the fore, looking for justice, looking to punish those that did so much damage to our civilization in the process.
[00:33:32.864 --> 00:33:34.045]  And I still hear it to this day.
[00:33:34.085 --> 00:33:35.326]  It's the most frustrating thing ever.
[00:33:36.867 --> 00:33:38.528]  The virus shut down schools.
[00:33:38.588 --> 00:33:39.589]  The virus did this.
[00:33:39.629 --> 00:33:40.589]  The virus did that.
[00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:42.751]  The virus didn't do a damn thing.
[00:33:43.071 --> 00:33:45.032]  The government did all of that.
[00:33:45.112 --> 00:34:00.976]   But see, that's the problem is, When you want to properly attribute the blame where it belongs, when you actually want to attribute the blame to those responsible, then all of a sudden it's, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:34:01.236 --> 00:34:04.178]  But if you want to blame the virus for everything, then it's okay.
[00:34:04.238 --> 00:34:06.499]  Blame the virus, the virus did all this bad stuff.
[00:34:06.719 --> 00:34:11.121]  But then when you point out it was the government, then it was, oh, never mind, it's not bad, it's good actually.
[00:34:11.321 --> 00:34:13.782]  When the government does it, it's good, but if a virus did it, it's bad.
[00:34:15.303 --> 00:34:16.944]  So no, it's not going to go in the rear view.
[00:34:18.496 --> 00:34:21.457]  Because there needs to be justice, there needs to be closure here.
[00:34:22.137 --> 00:34:25.638]  The individuals that made this virus in a lab need to be punished.
[00:34:26.598 --> 00:34:29.219]  And those that covered it up need to be investigated.
[00:34:30.099 --> 00:34:31.299]  But that's just the beginning.
[00:34:32.299 --> 00:34:33.820]  Then you get into the vaccines.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:44.222]  Now, I can pull data out of any country on Earth, from any period of time, post-vaccine.
[00:34:46.163 --> 00:34:56.449]   And you're going to get Except for maybe a plus minus five to ten percent difference, you're going to get the same result.
[00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:01.131]  That we got out of the most recent data from Canada.
[00:35:03.312 --> 00:35:07.533]  And the Daily Expose has the story, the public documents are available.
[00:35:09.034 --> 00:35:12.075]  Canada's pandemic of the fully vaccinated.
[00:35:13.425 --> 00:35:18.126]  Seven in every ten COVID-19 deaths are among fully vaccinated, according to official data.
[00:35:18.146 --> 00:35:19.446]  Trudeau's government trying to cover it up.
[00:35:19.486 --> 00:35:20.827]  Now, think about that, though.
[00:35:20.987 --> 00:35:22.827]  That's not even really the full truth.
[00:35:25.508 --> 00:35:28.408]  That's fully vaccinated, which is just as bad.
[00:35:28.528 --> 00:35:37.871]  They're saying 70% of fully vaccinated individuals, or rather, 70% of COVID deaths are fully vaccinated individuals.
[00:35:37.891 --> 00:35:39.291]  So that's the multiple vaccines.
[00:35:41.476 --> 00:35:53.742]  But if it's just, if it's just, if you're not talking about multiple vaccines, but just one vaccine, 90, the number is 90% of COVID deaths are among the vaccinated.
[00:35:55.023 --> 00:35:56.643]  So here's what you have to do now.
[00:35:58.404 --> 00:36:06.128]  How many of these deaths are from COVID and how many of these deaths are from vaccines?
[00:36:08.291 --> 00:36:10.672]  Now, the correlation here is pretty clear.
[00:36:11.652 --> 00:36:18.575]  If you're vaccinated, you have a higher chance of death from COVID than if you're not vaccinated.
[00:36:21.336 --> 00:36:32.300]  So, really, we've reached a point where I would say probably half of the COVID deaths are actually from the vaccine.
[00:36:36.806 --> 00:36:38.347]  Because the data here doesn't lie.
[00:36:40.108 --> 00:36:53.376]  Now obviously you can't make that claim before the vaccine comes out, but if you just look at the data post-vaccine, most COVID deaths are in vaccinated individuals.
[00:36:54.777 --> 00:36:57.039]  So is that really COVID or is that the vaccine?
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:10.407]   Because when the non-vaccinated are not dying from COVID, But the vaccinated are, well there's your controlled study right there.
[00:37:12.549 --> 00:37:13.729]  And what is the variable?
[00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.891]  The vaccine.
[00:37:17.932 --> 00:37:18.672]  So it's pretty clear.
[00:37:20.373 --> 00:37:28.719]  As if there wasn't enough evidence and data and shocking reporting and whistleblowing, it just continues to pile up.
[00:37:29.519 --> 00:37:32.561]  The vaccines are killing people.
[00:37:35.806 --> 00:37:56.901]  And to me, the proof is now in the pudding here, and it's really just an unbelievable attempt at a cover-up with Hillary Clinton and Jen Psaki and Barack Obama all getting COVID in the same week.
[00:37:58.142 --> 00:38:00.103]  Now, were they at some secret meeting together?
[00:38:00.764 --> 00:38:03.466]  Or is that just a coincidence people are asking?
[00:38:05.011 --> 00:38:09.394]  But each one of them, oh, I've got COVID, by the way, I'm fine.
[00:38:10.615 --> 00:38:11.996]  The vaccine is working.
[00:38:14.938 --> 00:38:18.421]  Literally all within a week here, Clinton, Obama, and Psaki get COVID.
[00:38:18.441 --> 00:38:20.122]  Now, they could all be lying.
[00:38:21.403 --> 00:38:22.724]  I don't think that would shock anybody.
[00:38:23.084 --> 00:38:25.746]  Obama, Clinton, and Psaki telling a lie?
[00:38:25.766 --> 00:38:29.909]  Well, that's like the sun rising and setting.
[00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:36.521]   That's like Water is in a river or a lake.
[00:38:37.762 --> 00:38:41.946]  So, yeah, Clinton, Obama, Psaki could all be lying about this for various reasons.
[00:38:43.327 --> 00:38:43.968]  But it's hilarious.
[00:38:44.088 --> 00:38:47.631]  They get COVID, they say, hey, it's not bad, by the way, the vaccine is working.
[00:38:48.992 --> 00:38:50.013]  An incredible admission.
[00:38:50.434 --> 00:39:06.345]   So you admit COVID is not that bad, and it's not deadly, and that the vaccine is not working, all in one statement, but yet somehow, That's used to promote the vaccine and the COVID fear-mongering.
[00:39:08.967 --> 00:39:10.249]  It's total clown world, folks.
[00:39:12.251 --> 00:39:31.485]   It's total clown world, where the exact evidence and proof you would need that you don't need to be afraid of COVID and that the vaccine isn't working, And they somehow use that to argue the vaccine is working and you still need to be afraid of COVID.
[00:39:33.286 --> 00:39:36.088]  Only in the bizarro clown world does that work.
[00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:47.733]  And it's the ancient quotable from Voltaire, if they can make you believe absurdities, they can make you commit atrocities.
[00:39:48.514 --> 00:39:50.575]  This is what's happening on so many different levels.
[00:39:52.316 --> 00:39:53.056]  But let's move on.
[00:39:54.858 --> 00:40:01.880]  Ten CEOs of airlines call on President Biden to move on from mask mandates on flight.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:11.042]  So, people aren't flying anymore, they're sick of the mask, the airlines are starting to realize that, and they want the federal mandate on the planes to be revoked.
[00:40:13.282 --> 00:40:14.143]  We'll see how that goes.
[00:40:15.723 --> 00:40:18.904]  New Zealand scraps vaccine passports and mandates.
[00:40:19.444 --> 00:40:24.445]  Wow, after they were so hardcore and how important it all was, now they're scrapping it.
[00:40:25.117 --> 00:40:28.556]  But not before they vaccinated a bunch of people that are probably going to die from it.
[00:40:30.327 --> 00:40:32.028]  Ignored by fake news media, U.S.
[00:40:32.048 --> 00:40:36.750]  COVID deaths to pass 1 million mark today, more than 600,000 deaths under Joe Biden.
[00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:37.570]  Yeah, remember?
[00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:39.831]  Oh, every COVID death is Trump's fault.
[00:40:39.931 --> 00:40:40.631]  It's all Trump.
[00:40:41.212 --> 00:40:43.273]  Look at the blood on Trump's hands from COVID.
[00:40:43.693 --> 00:40:47.394]  Well, now it's Biden with more COVID deaths, and that's with the vaccine.
[00:40:47.654 --> 00:40:49.295]  So, you know, maybe there's another story there.
[00:40:49.335 --> 00:40:49.835]  We know what it is.
[00:40:49.855 --> 00:40:50.776]  The vaccine's killing people.
[00:40:50.796 --> 00:40:53.957]  But, oh, the media says Biden's doing such a great job.
[00:40:54.637 --> 00:40:58.119]  More people dead under Biden, but that's because he's doing a better job than Trump.
[00:40:59.997 --> 00:41:04.898]  An individual recounts what their child is going through in school.
[00:41:04.918 --> 00:41:08.519]  I mean, this is just disgusting stuff in the city of Chicago.
[00:41:09.439 --> 00:41:20.041]  Today, my son, who faces severe speech delays and needs to see faces to be able to see his own and be able to see his own, toddled off happily to pre-K at school.
[00:41:21.581 --> 00:41:28.142]  He was returned to me two hours later with a mask forcibly tied to his face by a teacher, crying.
[00:41:30.083 --> 00:41:37.632]  What kind of sick, demented freak would tie a mask to a kid's face?
[00:41:37.672 --> 00:41:38.994]  Now, we've seen these liberal teachers.
[00:41:39.014 --> 00:41:41.937]  They are tying them off, they're taping them, they're duct taping them.
[00:41:41.977 --> 00:41:43.039]  I mean, it's basically torture.
[00:41:44.673 --> 00:41:45.653]  And who is it every time?
[00:41:45.733 --> 00:41:50.495]  It's a freak show leftist teacher that wants to torture your kids.
[00:41:51.136 --> 00:41:54.937]  Either sexually pervert them or literally put a muzzle over their face.
[00:41:55.337 --> 00:41:58.058]  Israel COVID-19 cases surge.
[00:41:58.738 --> 00:42:00.019]  83.1% are vaccinated.
[00:42:00.059 --> 00:42:00.599]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:42:00.639 --> 00:42:05.101]  It's about 5-10% give either way on the numbers, but it's...
[00:42:06.411 --> 00:42:10.354]  You work off 85% as the number?
[00:42:10.374 --> 00:42:21.304]  85% of COVID deaths, give or take 10% or 5%, I'd say, probably, give or take 5% from 85% of COVID deaths are vaccinated, no matter which country you investigate.
[00:42:22.024 --> 00:42:29.210]  Nova Scotia adds 13 types of cancer to workplace insurance coverage for firefighters, where they forced them to get the vaccine.
[00:42:29.571 --> 00:42:32.673]  Now, all of a sudden, all these new cancers are popping up, so they have to cover it.
[00:42:33.013 --> 00:42:34.475]  Huh, wonder what that's about?
[00:42:35.532 --> 00:42:39.533]  Italian champion cyclist collapses after first stage of Volta in Spain.
[00:42:40.293 --> 00:42:41.573]  CPR performed at the scene.
[00:42:42.413 --> 00:42:48.094]  Another account of an athlete vaccinated passes out on the field of competition.
[00:42:48.434 --> 00:42:54.855]  Remember all the lies the Democrats, the Biden administration, and the media told us about inflation?
[00:42:57.296 --> 00:43:08.863]   Well, in case you don't, here is a short compilation in a time frame, in a linear time frame, of the different messaging
[00:43:08.863 --> 00:43:14.434]   and claims that have been made about inflation from inflation doesn't exist, it's not going to
[00:43:14.434 --> 00:43:18.903]   happen, it's temporary, it's COVID, it's Putin.
[00:43:18.903 --> 00:43:27.624]   Here it is in a short video clip just showing you how this administration lies about everything,
[00:43:27.624 --> 00:43:29.863]  but in this case specifically inflation.
[00:43:29.863 --> 00:43:31.544]  Anyway, thank you guys.
[00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:33.890]  Should Americans be worried about inflation, sir?
[00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:44.890]   Well, I really doubt that we're going to see an inflationary cycle.
[00:43:45.453 --> 00:43:52.235]  And by the way, talking inflation, the overwhelming consensus is going to pop up a little bit and then go back down.
[00:43:52.955 --> 00:43:58.636]  I don't know anybody, including Larry Summers, who's a friend of mine, who's worried about inflation.
[00:43:59.178 --> 00:44:04.221]  We also know that as our economy has come roaring back, we've seen some price increases.
[00:44:05.161 --> 00:44:09.143]  Some folks have raised worries that this could be a sign of persistent inflation.
[00:44:09.844 --> 00:44:11.224]  But that's not our view.
[00:44:12.125 --> 00:44:13.926]  Inflation, you said?
[00:44:13.946 --> 00:44:14.266]  Okay.
[00:44:14.706 --> 00:44:24.089]   Well, I would first say that one of the steps that we've taken as an administration is to provide a range of assistance to the American people, whether it is
[00:44:24.089 --> 00:44:25.729]  in the form of $1,400 checks.
[00:44:25.729 --> 00:44:30.449]   But Caitlin, if you actually look at the numbers and the trends over the last several months,
[00:44:30.449 --> 00:44:37.328]   it shows that core inflation was not only below expectations, but it decelerated from
[00:44:37.328 --> 00:44:38.328]  last month.
[00:44:38.328 --> 00:44:44.889]   You had told us at a town hall, I think it was in July, that it was just near-term inflation.
[00:44:44.885 --> 00:44:48.988]  The number one thing that the president can do is help get COVID under control.
[00:44:49.848 --> 00:44:55.072]  That, we know, is the root cause of inflation and the price increases we're seeing for a range of reasons.
[00:44:55.553 --> 00:45:03.919]  And finally, even as we meet, even as we meet to work out this challenge, it's important to maintain perspective.
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:06.781]  Prices have gone up.
[00:45:08.719 --> 00:45:20.302]  And families and individuals are dealing with the realities of that bread costs more, that gas costs more.
[00:45:20.382 --> 00:45:22.163]  Now we have to understand what that means.
[00:45:23.003 --> 00:45:25.544]  That's about the cost of living going up.
[00:45:25.944 --> 00:45:30.485]  When people go to the grocery store and a pound of meat is more expensive than it should be, we agree.
[00:45:30.785 --> 00:45:32.886]  That's less related to supply chain issues.
[00:45:33.286 --> 00:45:35.706]  The inflation has everything to do with the supply chain.
[00:45:36.787 --> 00:45:37.647]  Inflation is up.
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:39.780]  It's up.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:44.582]  The second big reason for inflation is Vladimir Putin.
[00:45:45.962 --> 00:45:46.923]  Ah, and there it is.
[00:45:48.243 --> 00:45:48.543]  Yeah.
[00:45:49.124 --> 00:45:50.584]  And I love this joke going around.
[00:45:50.864 --> 00:45:54.706]  Here's one example from Ice-T, but I'll do my own little rendition.
[00:45:56.606 --> 00:46:02.449]  Guys, last night I was out and about and I was robbed.
[00:46:03.049 --> 00:46:04.469]  I was robbed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:07.969]   And The police came.
[00:46:08.029 --> 00:46:09.790]  I reported it to the police and the police showed up.
[00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:11.151]  They said, well, do you know who robbed you?
[00:46:11.171 --> 00:46:12.632]  And I said, yeah, it was pump number five.
[00:46:14.534 --> 00:46:15.054]  I was robbed.
[00:46:16.876 --> 00:46:19.438]  And so that's the big joke, but that's just part of the inflation.
[00:46:20.459 --> 00:46:23.341]  It's just incredible what liars they are, but the world sees it.
[00:46:24.161 --> 00:46:29.286]  And really, this administration is by far the most pathetic in American history.
[00:46:30.225 --> 00:46:31.546]  Certainly modern day history.
[00:46:31.666 --> 00:46:33.488]  I mean, it's just, it's abysmal.
[00:46:33.908 --> 00:46:34.829]  It's an embarrassment.
[00:46:35.149 --> 00:46:35.950]  It's a clown show.
[00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:37.151]  I mean, you name it.
[00:46:37.951 --> 00:46:38.672]  It's undeniable.
[00:46:39.673 --> 00:46:54.925]  And I'm just thinking, if we can somehow save this country politically, which I think at this point, and I know that a lot of people may not agree with this, but at this point it probably would mean Trump getting back in the White House.
[00:46:56.258 --> 00:47:04.381]  And hopefully being a lot better in his second go-around and having a much better group of people surrounding him in his administration.
[00:47:04.701 --> 00:47:12.963]  You understand, that would be like sometimes at a football game or a hockey game or something, they'll have like the little peewee athletes play at halftime in between the breaks.
[00:47:13.743 --> 00:47:17.325]  They'll have little peewee players running around and you say, okay, it's kind of fun.
[00:47:17.645 --> 00:47:20.626]  And then the professionals get back up and you're like, oh, those are pros.
[00:47:20.646 --> 00:47:24.607]  I mean, that's what it's going to look like in comparison from Biden to the next Trump administration, if so.
[00:47:25.655 --> 00:47:30.937]  If they can make you believe absurdities, they can make you commit atrocities.
[00:47:32.597 --> 00:47:36.678]  Voltaire famously said that, and that's what we're seeing, folks.
[00:47:36.758 --> 00:47:42.760]  If they can make you believe absurdities, men or women, being obese is healthy.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.861]  Joe Biden is physically and mentally fit, more so than Trump.
[00:47:50.182 --> 00:47:51.962]  I don't think we need to go any further down the line.
[00:47:51.982 --> 00:47:53.583]  I think we get the point here.
[00:47:54.881 --> 00:47:57.603]  Then they can make you commit atrocities.
[00:47:58.043 --> 00:47:59.384]  Oh, let's groom children.
[00:47:59.444 --> 00:48:01.666]  Let's chop little boys' balls off.
[00:48:04.008 --> 00:48:08.591]  So first they make you believe the absurdities, then you commit the atrocities.
[00:48:10.472 --> 00:48:12.874]  Oh, COVID-19 is the most deadly virus ever.
[00:48:12.894 --> 00:48:14.235]  So deadly you don't even know you have it.
[00:48:15.476 --> 00:48:16.336]  That's the absurdity.
[00:48:16.957 --> 00:48:17.797]  What's the atrocity?
[00:48:18.338 --> 00:48:22.741]  Here, take this experimental injection that's killing people.
[00:48:26.041 --> 00:48:31.404]  If they can make you believe absurdities, they can make you commit atrocities.
[00:48:33.145 --> 00:48:39.288]  Let's look at some of the absurdities and atrocities that are going on here when it comes to the grooming of children.
[00:48:39.569 --> 00:48:40.469]  And that's what this is.
[00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:53.518]   And so, you know, I could chalk it up to the fact that yesterday, When I was covering this, I kind of went on an unhinged rant, and I mean, I'll admit that.
[00:48:53.578 --> 00:49:04.461]  But, you know, I see adults grooming children, and I don't tend to respond to that well, especially after staring at it all day for six hours hosting a talk show.
[00:49:05.301 --> 00:49:07.462]  As they say, stare into the abyss long enough, you become it.
[00:49:09.189 --> 00:49:13.693]  But I guess that's my problem is I don't like kids being sexually groomed by perverts.
[00:49:14.213 --> 00:49:15.535]  So I guess that's my problem.
[00:49:15.595 --> 00:49:25.944]  I guess I'm the person with the problem because I don't like to see young children, including prepubescent children, being taught how to be sexual deviants and perverts.
[00:49:26.444 --> 00:49:28.166]  I guess that's my shortcoming.
[00:49:28.706 --> 00:49:32.009]  I should be proud that we're grooming children to be sexual deviants.
[00:49:32.049 --> 00:49:33.750]  We should be celebrating this.
[00:49:35.272 --> 00:49:36.293]  So I should be happy!
[00:49:38.171 --> 00:49:43.994]  That the BBC promotes 15-year-old drag queen who performs at private functions like a stripper.
[00:49:46.055 --> 00:49:56.840]  The BBC has promoted a 15-year-old teenage drag queen, Cherry West, who performs at private functions and LGBT pride events.
[00:49:58.441 --> 00:50:03.463]  Sam Carlin, 15, started performing as Cherry West when he was 13.
[00:50:05.453 --> 00:50:12.136]  After being introduced to his current passion, as the BBC describes it, on a family holiday in Lanzarote when he was 10.
[00:50:15.677 --> 00:50:22.220]  We just stumbled upon this drag bar and thought, this is going to be a laugh, said Carlin's dad, also called Sam.
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:30.243]  So we went in and had a great time, although I got taken up on stage, and I got dressed up into a drag queen.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.322]  Sam thought it was funny.
[00:50:33.862 --> 00:50:34.923]  I was very embarrassed.
[00:50:35.864 --> 00:50:38.687]  Both his parents are supportive of his drag career.
[00:50:39.468 --> 00:50:39.588]  Oh!
[00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:41.871]  Well, the parents love it.
[00:50:41.891 --> 00:50:43.092]  They're getting all this attention.
[00:50:43.112 --> 00:50:43.833]  They're getting praised.
[00:50:43.853 --> 00:50:44.654]  They're getting celebrated.
[00:50:44.674 --> 00:50:46.096]  And I guess they're getting paid.
[00:50:47.757 --> 00:50:51.421]  And quite frankly, that's why you see a lot of these deranged lunatics.
[00:50:52.452 --> 00:51:01.315]  Promoting their kids to be gay or dressing them up if they're a girl as a boy or a boy as a girl and promoting it on social media because they realize there's actually an economic opportunity there for them.
[00:51:01.655 --> 00:51:03.655]  They use their children for profit.
[00:51:04.576 --> 00:51:10.698]  So it's a whole nother level of derangement, a whole nother level of mental depravity that the left is engaged in.
[00:51:12.458 --> 00:51:16.099]  Fifteen-year-old drag queen who gets paid to perform at functions?
[00:51:16.419 --> 00:51:21.961]  I mean, folks, you're one click away from being a fifteen-year-old stripper whore.
[00:51:23.632 --> 00:51:24.672]  And we celebrate this.
[00:51:27.653 --> 00:51:30.254]  It's just, it's just whacked out, man.
[00:51:30.774 --> 00:51:32.895]  It is just so whacked out.
[00:51:35.316 --> 00:51:36.516]  And, and you know, here's the thing.
[00:51:36.596 --> 00:51:41.338]  We kind of reached, I mean, if you're a social liberal, I would consider myself a social liberal.
[00:51:42.218 --> 00:51:47.380]  I know a lot of conservatives don't, don't really like social liberal conservatives.
[00:51:48.401 --> 00:51:52.502]  But hey, there's room for disagreement and debate and discourse and not everybody thinking the same.
[00:51:54.858 --> 00:51:56.259]  I never grew up with any of this crap.
[00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:08.108]  I never grew up with gay pride parades and tranny time and drag queen time and all this other BS that they're showing kids before they can even hit puberty.
[00:52:09.669 --> 00:52:10.249]  And guess what?
[00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:21.656]   By the time I was in high school, I had plenty of gay friends, boys and girls, And, you know, they knew they were gay, and they knew what they were into, and it wasn't a big deal.
[00:52:21.696 --> 00:52:25.697]  They didn't need to rub it in your face, and you didn't really care, and it was just live and let live.
[00:52:27.818 --> 00:52:31.240]  And so this whole notion, like, oh, we have to do this.
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:35.882]  We have to do this for the gay kids and the trans kids and all this other garbage.
[00:52:36.622 --> 00:52:38.523]  No, you're not doing it for them.
[00:52:39.183 --> 00:52:40.483]  You're doing it for yourselves.
[00:52:40.503 --> 00:52:42.604]  You're doing it so you can groom these kids.
[00:52:43.705 --> 00:52:46.306]  And then the question becomes, why?
[00:52:48.479 --> 00:52:56.462]  Why are you so desperate to groom these kids into your sexual perversion unless you have a desire to rape them?
[00:52:58.703 --> 00:53:00.143]  It's an honest, it's a fair question.
[00:53:02.524 --> 00:53:03.364]  Needs to be asked.
[00:53:03.544 --> 00:53:05.505]  Maybe it will be pretty soon, right to their face.
[00:53:09.566 --> 00:53:25.811]   Why are you so interested In teaching these kids sexually perverted deviancies before they can hit puberty, why are you so concerned with that unless you plan on engaging with them sexually at some point?
[00:53:27.392 --> 00:53:28.312]  That's what this is about.
[00:53:29.953 --> 00:53:31.253]  There's been gay people forever.
[00:53:32.614 --> 00:53:35.695]  If you want to make the argument they've been discriminated against in the past, fine.
[00:53:36.915 --> 00:53:37.535]  Not anymore.
[00:53:37.996 --> 00:53:38.656]  Not the case.
[00:53:42.455 --> 00:53:49.901]  So it's gone from, we've reached kind of a good point, if you're a social liberal, where, hey, guess what?
[00:53:49.941 --> 00:53:51.142]  We're accepting of everybody.
[00:53:51.342 --> 00:53:55.525]  Gay, straight, bi, you're an adult that wants to cross-dress, fine, whatever.
[00:53:56.746 --> 00:54:07.935]  To now, no, we have to teach the kids how to do this, we have to indoctrinate the kids, and the excuse is, well, we don't want them to feel left out or discriminated against for all this stuff.
[00:54:08.415 --> 00:54:09.135]  Bullcrap.
[00:54:11.758 --> 00:54:12.278]  Bullcrap.
[00:54:14.972 --> 00:54:17.815]  It has everything to do with you grooming them sexually.
[00:54:18.136 --> 00:54:22.121]  It has nothing to do with making sure gay people feel comfortable.
[00:54:25.144 --> 00:54:26.566]  Oh, are there gay kids that get bullied?
[00:54:26.906 --> 00:54:28.888]  Sure, there's all kinds of kids that get bullied.
[00:54:29.709 --> 00:54:30.610]  Bullying happens!
[00:54:33.434 --> 00:54:35.036]  This is sexual grooming, folks.
[00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:46.236]  Illinois education standards say grades K-2 should learn about gender, gender identity, and gender stereotypes.
[00:54:46.837 --> 00:54:53.901]  Grades 3-5 learn about masturbation, puberty blockers, and trans children, literal grooming, homeschool your kids.
[00:54:54.962 --> 00:54:59.745]  Trans kids don't exist until a pervert gets their hands on them.
[00:55:01.967 --> 00:55:03.448]  That's the response.
[00:55:04.591 --> 00:55:08.114]  Trans kids don't exist until a pervert gets their hands on them.
[00:55:08.734 --> 00:55:18.362]  And they have all the documents here with the images where they're teaching these little kids how to have gay sex and use sex toys and mutilate their genitals, masturbate.
[00:55:20.884 --> 00:55:21.985]  Oh my gosh, man.
[00:55:23.366 --> 00:55:25.348]  You know, I prayed on this last night and I really focused myself.
[00:55:27.335 --> 00:55:31.876]  Just to refocus myself to not blow up on air like I did last night covering this stuff.
[00:55:32.497 --> 00:55:36.918]  I mean, folks, you understand they're giving this stuff to children.
[00:55:40.919 --> 00:55:43.919]  And it's like, oh my gosh.
[00:55:43.919 --> 00:55:55.919]  So all the documents are here.
[00:55:55.344 --> 00:55:56.424]  It's on the libs for TikTok.
[00:55:59.128 --> 00:56:28.345]   and it's just they just want they just want to be it's kinda like when it's like the first thing a child sees it it recognizes as the mother and it forms that attachment that bond this is like you're being born sexually but it's not the natural progress of going through puberty and maybe having your first kiss or You know, experimenting or whatever.
[00:56:29.125 --> 00:56:36.687]  It's not through that organic natural process where you kind of learn things for yourself or, you know, you fall in love with a girl or something and you're like, wow, this is awesome.
[00:56:36.727 --> 00:56:37.427]  I love this connection.
[00:56:37.447 --> 00:56:37.987]  I love this feeling.
[00:56:38.227 --> 00:56:45.949]  It's no, we're here as drag queens and gay liberals, and we're going to be the mother of that process.
[00:56:46.289 --> 00:56:59.994]  So your kid's gonna be gay, and we're gonna show your kids the different kind of anal sex toys and lube and ways to masturbate and play with themselves, and just like a newborn baby attaches to their mother, these kids then attach their sexuality to these perverts.
[00:57:00.734 --> 00:57:06.976]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones Show, brought to you by InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:08.337 --> 00:57:18.321]   Folks, I'm telling you, The immune support formula that we have just launched at InfoWareStore.com, we're so happy about this.
[00:57:19.382 --> 00:57:31.909]  Especially with everything that's gone down in the last two years plus and people are starting to think about their immune system and rethinking the way they prepare for getting sick or getting a virus or a cough or anything.
[00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:36.371]  And they're thinking about their immune system.
[00:57:38.237 --> 00:57:45.000]  Dr. Death Fauci and the rest of these corrupt scumbags in the health sector of our federal government.
[00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:47.221]  They're not going to tell you about your immune system.
[00:57:47.261 --> 00:57:49.342]  They're not going to tell you about exercise and all that stuff.
[00:57:49.823 --> 00:57:56.466]  But we will, and we'll provide options for you to help build your immune system.
[00:57:57.882 --> 00:58:16.967]  All the supplements at Infowarsstore.com have something involved or something in their ingredients that's going to be good for your immune system, but now we have the product that is just fully 100% dedicated to building your immune system with known ingredients that are all natural and organic, known to give you immune support.
[00:58:17.027 --> 00:58:30.700]   It's the Immune Support Liquid Tincture Proprietary Natural Formula with the ingredients elderberry, Augustafolia root, Lomatium root, Astragalus root, Angelica root, and so much more.
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:33.761]  Just all natural stuff known good for your immune system.
[00:58:36.063 --> 00:58:40.065]  And we're just so excited that this is going on now.
[00:58:41.646 --> 00:58:44.007]  In fact, what is that, crew?
[00:58:44.067 --> 00:58:44.488]  What do you want?
[00:58:46.329 --> 00:58:46.929]  You want to see it?
[00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:49.190]  Is that what you're requesting right now?
[00:58:50.431 --> 00:58:57.412]   The crew wants to see The droplets on the paper that I have in front of me.

[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:28.664]  And you can see pretty thick there too, these droplets holding their shape, if you will.

[01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:09.292]   And it is at an introductory sale rate right now of 25% off.
[01:00:09.292 --> 01:00:16.771]   Part of our Infowars emergency blowout sale happening now where
[01:00:16.771 --> 01:00:26.771]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:00:18.570 --> 01:00:39.654]  It's basically, I mean, we're not, it's not a going out of business sale, because we don't plan on going out of business, but, you know, it's like they're trying to put us out of business and we want to survive, so we just got to sell everything out as quickly as possible to pay some bills to just extend our life a couple months here and then reformulate things to see how we're going to fund ourselves for the next month.
[01:00:41.034 --> 01:00:48.703]   Hell, if we had big donors like George Soros, the big billionaire donors that just Just flushed us with millions and millions of dollars.
[01:00:48.743 --> 01:00:51.285]  We wouldn't have to worry about it, but that's not how we operate around here.
[01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:52.886]  We don't have big corporate sponsors.
[01:00:53.206 --> 01:00:54.808]  We just have you, the audience.
[01:00:55.548 --> 01:00:55.929]  That's it.
[01:00:58.131 --> 01:01:04.196]  And we have been able to bring on a couple sponsors, but we sell our own proprietary products at InfowarsStore.com and that's what keeps us on the air.
[01:01:04.596 --> 01:01:07.759]  And it's your support there as well that makes it all possible.
[01:01:07.839 --> 01:01:08.119]  All right.
[01:01:11.724 --> 01:01:15.727]  You know, we do care about your health, unlike, apparently, the mainstream media.
[01:01:16.407 --> 01:01:18.909]  And here's the thing.
[01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:33.719]  I don't really get involved in people's personal business as far as... I mean, maybe if I had a friend that I saw was really getting unhealthy or out of shape or something, I would say something.
[01:01:33.759 --> 01:01:36.981]  But, I mean, for the most part, it's your own body, it's your own life.
[01:01:37.947 --> 01:01:45.133]  But see, what we do here at InfoWars is we just counter all of the propaganda media with the truth.
[01:01:45.954 --> 01:01:57.925]  So, I'm not on here to attack people that are obese or out of shape, but it's an unhealthy way to live, and you'll be much happier when you're a healthier person.
[01:01:58.045 --> 01:02:07.495]   And so, when they have these new shows, That are just dedicated to fat people and promoting it as a good thing.
[01:02:07.515 --> 01:02:09.797]  It's really just kind of disgusting.
[01:02:11.739 --> 01:02:17.324]  Again, I don't really care if you're fat and you can use that as a personality trait and that's all fine and dandy.
[01:02:17.704 --> 01:02:20.207]  But let's not act like this is a health thing.
[01:02:21.207 --> 01:02:23.690]  Let's not act like you don't have a serious health problem.
[01:02:24.050 --> 01:02:25.091]  And here's the funny thing.
[01:02:25.111 --> 01:02:26.833]  So they're showing this trailer.
[01:02:28.029 --> 01:02:30.210]  For this new show called Big Girls.
[01:02:31.071 --> 01:02:34.972]  And it's just obese women, probably you have to be 300 pounds to even get a role.
[01:02:34.992 --> 01:02:39.615]  You know, it's like the first thing they do is put you on a scale and see if you weigh as much as a hippo.
[01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:44.337]  And then you get the part if you're over 300 pounds or whatever.
[01:02:46.618 --> 01:02:49.720]  And I mean, it's just all this filth and disgust.
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.201]  And it's all this propaganda.
[01:02:52.701 --> 01:02:53.362]  Let me explain something.
[01:02:54.322 --> 01:02:58.346]   You could go back in time Probably not even that long ago.
[01:02:59.206 --> 01:03:00.607]  But what, 50 years maybe?
[01:03:01.527 --> 01:03:08.371]  You could go back in time, and you would never even see a woman that big.
[01:03:10.091 --> 01:03:13.773]  You would never even see a human being that big.
[01:03:16.594 --> 01:03:25.659]  So, there's something going on here, folks, that needs to be talked about.
[01:03:27.322 --> 01:03:30.643]  And again, I won't go after these women or attack them.
[01:03:30.683 --> 01:03:31.344]  They're out of shape.
[01:03:31.404 --> 01:03:34.525]  If they want to be unhealthy or whatever, that's their own thing.
[01:03:35.045 --> 01:03:41.247]  I'm never going to promote an unhealthy lifestyle, and I'm going to counter the propaganda media telling you that it's healthy to be obese.
[01:03:41.267 --> 01:03:41.887]  That's a lie.
[01:03:43.908 --> 01:03:54.761]   But why is it I mean, I don't have a chart in front of me, but you can probably look at the average weight of a female or a male in America.
[01:03:55.581 --> 01:04:06.245]  In fact, guys, see if you can pull something up, like see if there's a line graph or something, or some statistics about the average weight of a female or a male, and I guarantee you that number has gone up in the last 50 years.
[01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:08.346]  There's something there.
[01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:20.731]   And there's obvious, there's obvious there-there's, like, okay, the food, That is unhealthy that they eat, and it's the chemicals in the food.
[01:04:21.672 --> 01:04:22.493]  But it's more than that.
[01:04:22.573 --> 01:04:36.585]  It's the propaganda as well, and it's this new embracing the lifestyle of laziness, and saying, oh, I'm lazy, I'm fat.
[01:04:37.066 --> 01:04:38.167]  That's empowering.
[01:04:39.554 --> 01:04:46.296]  And then that just becomes an excuse to live an extremely unhealthy lifestyle, and the media says, hey, don't worry about that.
[01:04:46.356 --> 01:04:46.896]  You're good.
[01:04:46.936 --> 01:04:47.576]  You're great.
[01:04:48.737 --> 01:04:50.157]  You look like a beached whale.
[01:04:50.237 --> 01:04:50.997]  It's okay.
[01:04:52.218 --> 01:04:52.818]  And it's not.
[01:04:56.479 --> 01:04:59.000]  But, it is the food, folks.
[01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:00.280]  It is the seed oils.
[01:05:02.161 --> 01:05:03.621]  It is the processed sugar.
[01:05:03.701 --> 01:05:04.762]  It is the fast food.
[01:05:04.802 --> 01:05:05.602]  It is the soda.
[01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:15.497]  And for a nation that apparently cares so much about health post-pandemic, they really don't seem to care.
[01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:16.337]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:05:16.458 --> 01:05:17.979]  America is fatter than ever.
[01:05:18.519 --> 01:05:26.507]  Just in the last 20 years, body weight has gone up 10% in men and 5% in women.
[01:05:26.547 --> 01:05:27.888]  Folks, that is huge.
[01:05:27.968 --> 01:05:28.689]  No pun intended.
[01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:38.025]   I'm told here during the break that The Biden administration is considering giving out $300 gas stimulus checks?
[01:05:38.065 --> 01:05:39.546]  I don't know what the official term was.
[01:05:40.466 --> 01:05:45.087]  I thought it was something being proposed in California, but apparently it may be a Biden thing.
[01:05:47.188 --> 01:05:49.448]  Here's the story this morning from the Gateway Pundit.
[01:05:49.468 --> 01:05:56.410]  Democrats refuse new oil production projects, call for $300 a month checks to help Americans pay for record Biden gas prices.
[01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:58.310]  Oh my gosh.
[01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:00.931]  So that's just going to add to the inflation.
[01:06:02.622 --> 01:06:07.343]  That's just gonna add to the inflation, and it's really not gonna help anybody at all.
[01:06:08.803 --> 01:06:13.544]  I mean... Guys, put that story back up on screen for me, please.
[01:06:15.405 --> 01:06:22.026]  So, you're just gonna get $300 a month to pay for gas now?
[01:06:22.046 --> 01:06:24.807]  Oh my gosh.
[01:06:25.887 --> 01:06:30.488]  This is just... This administration is a clown show, man.
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:33.681]  This is just a clown show.
[01:06:35.081 --> 01:06:42.524]  You know, if you want Americans to have more money in their pockets and more money in their bank accounts, here's an idea.
[01:06:42.544 --> 01:06:46.346]  Why don't you cut taxes, you bastards?
[01:06:48.306 --> 01:06:50.507]  See, now the blood is starting to boil, folks.
[01:06:51.988 --> 01:06:53.688]  You know, I hate taxes.
[01:06:54.849 --> 01:06:55.789]  Who likes taxes?
[01:06:57.790 --> 01:06:58.210]  What the?
[01:06:58.290 --> 01:06:58.730]  What the?
[01:06:58.810 --> 01:06:59.871]  I mean, I just...
[01:07:01.749 --> 01:07:03.770]  That's the kind of thing that just knocks you off kilter.
[01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:07.371]  It's so clown-worldish.
[01:07:07.951 --> 01:07:09.312]  Please, just cut taxes.
[01:07:09.412 --> 01:07:12.653]  No, no, no, no, no, because they got to give themselves a raise.
[01:07:13.833 --> 01:07:26.957]  They still got to get their money on their congressional budgets, which is now... I mean, I'm almost to a point where I'd say that you should not even get paid to work in Congress.
[01:07:29.738 --> 01:07:30.239]  Or you should not...
[01:07:33.071 --> 01:07:35.514]  $200,000 to be a member of Congress is way too much.
[01:07:37.155 --> 01:07:40.478]  It should be a job of passion.
[01:07:41.179 --> 01:07:42.540]  It should be a job of service.
[01:07:44.382 --> 01:07:45.923]  Most people in America aren't making $200,000 a year.
[01:07:45.943 --> 01:07:46.183]  They're not.
[01:07:46.203 --> 01:07:48.606]  Congressional salaries should be no more than $100,000 a year.
[01:07:48.426 --> 01:07:55.286]   Now, congressional salaries should be no more than $100,000 a year.
[01:07:55.286 --> 01:07:58.006]  Even that might be too much.
[01:07:58.006 --> 01:08:04.526]   I mean, maybe if we quit spending all this money in foreign countries that don't help
[01:08:04.526 --> 01:08:07.125]  us at all, then maybe we could give Congress a bonus.
[01:08:07.125 --> 01:08:11.926]  But $300 for an American to buy gas every month?
[01:08:11.939 --> 01:08:13.300]  I mean, this is just insulting.
[01:08:15.522 --> 01:08:17.504]  This is clown world level stuff now.
[01:08:19.365 --> 01:08:20.246]  That we're dealing with.
[01:08:22.808 --> 01:08:22.968]  So...
[01:08:24.974 --> 01:08:27.015]  We'll see if that passes and it won't even matter.
[01:08:27.555 --> 01:08:29.595]  You'll get $300 a month for gasoline.
[01:08:30.195 --> 01:08:34.176]  That'll add another 3% to the inflation rate.
[01:08:34.516 --> 01:08:39.378]  It's not going to solve the problem of the supply chain shortages and the energy shortages.
[01:08:40.518 --> 01:08:44.779]  I mean, they can't be serious.
[01:08:46.059 --> 01:08:46.679]  But they are.
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:49.760]  Oh, they are.
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:51.040]  All right.
[01:08:52.141 --> 01:08:56.889]   Since we're talking about that, Let's get into some of this other political news here.
[01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:05.234]  So, we covered this yesterday and we played the clip, but it's imperative that people understand what's being proposed right now.
[01:09:05.995 --> 01:09:11.758]  Companies brace for higher compliance costs as SEC proposes climate disclosure.
[01:09:11.798 --> 01:09:12.839]  So what are they going to do?
[01:09:12.879 --> 01:09:18.422]  So now, you're going to be forced to pay climate taxes and carbon taxes.
[01:09:19.663 --> 01:09:27.853]   Which, if you think the price at the pump Let's say, I guess the Biden administration figures the average American is paying $300 more at the pump right now.
[01:09:28.333 --> 01:09:30.374]  So they're going to mitigate that by giving you $300.
[01:09:31.854 --> 01:09:32.454]  Here's an idea.
[01:09:32.514 --> 01:09:33.735]  Cut all the gas taxes.
[01:09:34.035 --> 01:09:37.236]  Cut taxes on the gas and oil companies, maybe they'll lower prices.
[01:09:37.436 --> 01:09:38.216]  No, we can't do that.
[01:09:38.256 --> 01:09:39.296]  Let's add to the inflation.
[01:09:39.556 --> 01:09:40.936]  Let's become full-blown communists.
[01:09:42.457 --> 01:09:46.798]  You think that the gas prices going up is devastating people.
[01:09:47.861 --> 01:09:50.863]  Which, okay, $300 a month, that'll hurt people.
[01:09:50.983 --> 01:09:54.284]  That can hurt people if you're spending that on gas and you're on a tight budget.
[01:09:55.285 --> 01:10:00.547]  But, for most people it won't completely devastate them.
[01:10:01.488 --> 01:10:08.872]  The proposed carbon taxes will be a devastation-level economic policy.
[01:10:10.192 --> 01:10:11.193]  But what are they going to do?
[01:10:13.554 --> 01:10:19.988]   Oh, you're paying more In your carbon tax now, but you can't afford it.
[01:10:20.048 --> 01:10:24.071]  So are they going to cut you a check to pay for your carbon tax now too?
[01:10:26.192 --> 01:10:27.093]  It's the same difference.
[01:10:30.856 --> 01:10:32.917]  Oh, I'm getting crushed by carbon taxes.
[01:10:32.977 --> 01:10:35.119]  Okay, here's a stimulus check to pay for your carbon taxes.
[01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:59.769]  And of course, see, this is where you really get down to the root cause of so many problems, and this is why they want the Great Reset, folks, because it's only a matter of time before people start asking the real questions like, if you can just print money out of thin air, why am I paying taxes?
[01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:00.409]  See that?
[01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:02.751]  Because that's what they do.
[01:11:04.801 --> 01:11:08.543]  If the government can print money out of thin air, why am I paying taxes?
[01:11:10.384 --> 01:11:12.384]  It's because you're a slave.
[01:11:12.384 --> 01:11:24.613]   And that's the kind of awakening process that this country needs to have that shouldn't be political, shouldn't be
[01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:25.783]  across party lines.
[01:11:25.783 --> 01:11:35.783]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:11:26.957 --> 01:11:31.540]  But it's so heavy and overbearing, you don't even want to bear the burden of dealing with it.
[01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:56.214]  And accepting that you have a fiat currency, that you've been lied to about it, and that your government treats you like a slave, forcing you to pay the tax man, when they just print money at will, whenever the hell they feel like it, and give it to foreign countries, 24-7, most of that money gets laundered back into politicians' pockets, and or their cronies that they have no-bid contracts with.
[01:11:58.379 --> 01:11:59.179]  Let me get back to the point.
[01:12:00.779 --> 01:12:03.720]  So, they can't get their Green New Deal passed.
[01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:09.121]  They can't sell the American people that you need to pay just to live.
[01:12:09.821 --> 01:12:13.482]  It's not really a good public policy and it's not really something they can legislate.
[01:12:14.382 --> 01:12:28.893]   So they're going to do the end around and they're going to use the Securities and Exchange Commission to bring in carbon taxes Without a single vote, without a single legislation or law passed, it's just going to be, oh, we're just doing this now.
[01:12:32.894 --> 01:12:40.697]  And then, you'll have the monitors on your vehicles, you'll have the monitors on your house, they've already installed them in most places.
[01:12:43.257 --> 01:13:22.940]   So, you may see your energy bill go up with the inflation and the energy crisis, so maybe the cost to heat or cool your home went from two hundred bucks a month to two hundred fifty bucks a month well then you're gonna get hit with that carbon tax and then you're gonna probably pay twenty five percent of that in a carbon tax and so really your energy bill just went to three hundred dollars a month but that's just on an individual basis they're gonna add carbon taxes for driving a vehicle if you're a business and you
[01:13:24.338 --> 01:13:34.466]  Deliver goods or services, or you actually have a building that needs heating and cooling, you're going to be paying massive dollar amounts in carbon taxes.
[01:13:34.966 --> 01:13:39.169]  And the whole goal here has nothing to do with stopping climate change.
[01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:42.692]  You could print $10 trillion tomorrow.
[01:13:43.072 --> 01:13:52.940]  You could print a $10 trillion bill tomorrow and say, I'm giving this to the climate change cause, and not a damn thing would change.
[01:13:54.508 --> 01:14:05.274]  And any green energy solutions would all have to be built on the back of coal or fossil fuels or natural gas, just like everything else.
[01:14:07.055 --> 01:14:10.636]  So it would never work anyway.
[01:14:10.937 --> 01:14:26.068]   But that's the apparent logic here is, oh, money will solve climate change, so you pay more, you become even more of a slave, you lose even more prosperity and freedom in the free market, The government gets more money to do what?
[01:14:26.568 --> 01:14:31.030]  Give to their friends, give to themselves, in the name of fighting climate change.
[01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:31.950]  But see, here's the catch.
[01:14:33.171 --> 01:14:35.172]  All the major corporations will be exempt.
[01:14:35.992 --> 01:14:37.112]  Google will be exempt.
[01:14:38.033 --> 01:14:39.013]  Meta will be exempt.
[01:14:39.133 --> 01:14:40.534]  All the big corporations will be exempt.
[01:14:40.614 --> 01:14:44.015]  They're going to crush the small businesses, and they're going to crush the individual.
[01:14:44.495 --> 01:14:53.119]  And then the hope is that eventually everybody's going to work for Google or Facebook or Amazon, and that's the only way to avoid getting crushed by the system.
[01:14:54.096 --> 01:15:05.778]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I gotta tell ya... And again, I prayed on this last night, and I'm gonna do a good job of not losing my temper here today.
[01:15:06.118 --> 01:15:09.559]  It's my one fault, if I have any here as a talk show host.
[01:15:09.579 --> 01:15:11.419]  Probably my biggest is just losing my temper.
[01:15:12.219 --> 01:15:27.618]   But, you know, I don't like the fact that they're grooming children to be pedophiles and sexual deviants, and I don't like that the Biden administration is currently Actively destroying my country, my livelihood, my future, my destiny.
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:33.101]  So, I mean, I just have to accept it.
[01:15:33.141 --> 01:15:34.322]  It's just a matter of fact, I guess.
[01:15:35.843 --> 01:15:38.704]  But there's something in me that says, no, you can do something about this.
[01:15:39.285 --> 01:15:41.666]  Maybe it's a fool's hope or a fool's errand.
[01:15:43.968 --> 01:15:51.394]  But it's like, it's just every break I'm just sitting here and it's just like, Biden administration crushing America here, crushing America there, destroying our culture here and there.
[01:15:51.414 --> 01:15:56.818]  I mean, it's just, it's just, oh, we're getting bombarded from every freaking angle with these people.
[01:15:58.239 --> 01:16:05.725]  And it's not going anywhere, there's no leadership seeming to pop up to stop this here, and it's just like, InfoWars and this audience is on an island.
[01:16:06.006 --> 01:16:11.250]  Yeah, finally some other people in media are getting a little more truthful and hardcore with it, but, man!
[01:16:14.929 --> 01:16:17.651]  Biden is speaking right now live in Brussels, by the way.
[01:16:22.494 --> 01:16:28.398]  I'm just overwhelmed by the fact that we have a current administration that wants to crush our country.
[01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:31.540]  And, you know, it's like just yesterday, Madeleine Albright dies.
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:33.541]  It's like, oh, she's a legend.
[01:16:33.601 --> 01:16:34.141]  She's a hero.
[01:16:34.422 --> 01:16:35.602]  She's a damn demon.
[01:16:36.283 --> 01:16:37.844]  She's a damn war criminal.
[01:16:40.205 --> 01:16:42.267]  It's a total bizarro world.
[01:16:42.687 --> 01:16:56.242]   And then there's the instinct Knowing this is all going on, and you just have to forget about the fact that you need to start preparing for this country to collapse.
[01:16:58.602 --> 01:17:03.784]  So let's go live to Biden here, speaking in Brussels to NATO.
[01:17:04.024 --> 01:17:08.725]  Here is the poopy pants, forgetful, sleepy Joe Biden.
[01:17:09.531 --> 01:17:13.156]  I'd be very fortunate if I had that same man running against me.
[01:17:13.576 --> 01:17:19.664]  Thank you very much.
[01:17:19.744 --> 01:17:20.726]  How long did he go, guys?
[01:17:20.766 --> 01:17:21.206]  Ten minutes?
[01:17:22.458 --> 01:17:24.239]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:17:24.319 --> 01:17:26.320]  Yeah, one final question, right?
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:29.022]  Hey, wait, hold on a second, please.
[01:17:29.682 --> 01:17:34.705]  I was supposed to be an hour ago at the European Union meeting and to speak.
[01:17:34.725 --> 01:17:35.765]  No, I'm thanking you.
[01:17:36.926 --> 01:17:38.847]  Someone I haven't called on before.
[01:17:39.567 --> 01:17:39.807]  You.
[01:17:41.368 --> 01:17:41.808]  Who are you?
[01:17:41.828 --> 01:17:43.029]  Okay.
[01:17:45.345 --> 01:17:46.585]  Sir, deterrence didn't work.
[01:17:47.346 --> 01:17:51.487]  What makes you think Vladimir Putin will alter course based on the action you've taken today?
[01:17:51.547 --> 01:17:52.507]  Let's get something straight.
[01:17:52.527 --> 01:17:59.049]  You remember, if you covered me from the very beginning, I did not say that, in fact, the sanctions would deter him.
[01:17:59.970 --> 01:18:01.550]  Sanctions never deter.
[01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:03.271]  You keep talking about that.
[01:18:04.291 --> 01:18:06.092]  Sanctions never deter.
[01:18:06.752 --> 01:18:25.602]  The maintenance of sanctions, the maintenance of sanctions, the increasing the pain, and the demonstration why I asked for this NATO meeting today is to be sure that after a month we will sustain what we're doing, not just next month, the following month, but for the remainder of this entire year.
[01:18:26.023 --> 01:18:27.543]  That's what will stop him.
[01:18:27.724 --> 01:18:28.024]  Wow.
[01:18:30.788 --> 01:18:31.828]  I'm going to translate that for you.
[01:18:31.868 --> 01:18:32.589]  That's not what I said.
[01:18:32.609 --> 01:18:34.349]  You're playing a game with me.
[01:18:34.570 --> 01:18:34.810]  I know.
[01:18:34.830 --> 01:18:35.770]  The answer is no.
[01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:39.051]  I think what happens is we have to demonstrate the purpose.
[01:18:39.431 --> 01:18:53.097]  The single most important thing is for us to stay unified and the world continue to focus on what a brute this guy is and all the innocent people's lives are being lost and ruined and what's going on.
[01:18:53.917 --> 01:18:54.958]  That's the important thing.
[01:18:55.299 --> 01:19:04.388]  But look, if you're Putin and you think that Europe is going to crack in a month or six weeks or two months, why not?
[01:19:05.369 --> 01:19:07.070]  They can take anything for another month.
[01:19:07.751 --> 01:19:08.972]  But we have to demonstrate.
[01:19:09.012 --> 01:19:13.837]  The reason I asked for the meeting, we have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united.
[01:19:13.957 --> 01:19:14.278]  Thank you.
[01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:21.111]  All right, so Biden exiting stage left here.
[01:19:21.871 --> 01:19:23.532]  Guys, how long was he live?
[01:19:23.832 --> 01:19:26.212]  Because 10, 15 minutes?
[01:19:26.232 --> 01:19:29.193]  Okay, about 10, 15 minutes there.
[01:19:29.213 --> 01:19:32.034]  We just broke in at the final moment, obviously, as you saw with us.
[01:19:33.514 --> 01:19:37.135]  So I'm not sure the full speech, obviously, I didn't hear it.
[01:19:37.215 --> 01:19:40.596]  But what he just said at the end is a big statement.
[01:19:40.656 --> 01:19:45.898]  And then there was a big statement he made about what they plan on doing for the rest of the year.
[01:19:47.563 --> 01:19:50.426]  And then there is the statements he made about the sanctions.
[01:19:50.966 --> 01:20:01.136]  So, you're going to have new video clips, compilations, probably by the end of the day, where it's going to be Biden originally saying how the sanctions are going to work and they're going to be tough.
[01:20:02.838 --> 01:20:05.500]  And then Psaki saying the sanctions are going to deter Putin.
[01:20:06.201 --> 01:20:10.525]  And then the same day Biden reversing course and saying, no, the sanctions were never meant to stop Putin.
[01:20:14.867 --> 01:20:21.633]  But really what he just said is this is going to be a slow burn to starting a larger war with Russia is basically what he just said.
[01:20:23.055 --> 01:20:46.144]   Which to me means they've already decided in a timeline of events if they can have any control over it, they're going to up the I would say they would probably move on from saber-rattling to actually engaging in physical attacks or threatening physical attacks against Putin after the midterms.
[01:20:47.305 --> 01:20:53.067]  That's basically what Biden just said through my political translation of these political snakes.
[01:20:54.591 --> 01:21:05.658]  Is they're gonna wait till after the midterms to make a real move against Putin because Putin is the perfect scapegoat for them and the collapse of our economy and the Bidenflation and the supply chain and everything.
[01:21:05.918 --> 01:21:12.262]  They just blame Putin for everything so that when the midterms come along they don't suffer a total defeat.
[01:21:14.363 --> 01:21:20.747]  And that's basically what Biden just admitted there probably unintentionally when he said, oh for the rest of the year we have this plan.
[01:21:22.052 --> 01:21:29.092]   It's going to be a slow burn, a slow buildup to then, once they have either a dead duck presidency or a dead duck
[01:21:29.092 --> 01:21:33.613]   Congress, to then start doing radical things against Putin, which
[01:21:33.613 --> 01:21:37.992]   will be unpopular, but that's why they're going to wait till after the midterms
[01:21:37.992 --> 01:21:38.653]  to do it.
[01:21:38.653 --> 01:22:01.252]   But again, people will find the clips of Joe Biden [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:21:52.813 --> 01:21:57.936]  Talking about how they're going to get tough with sanctions on Putin and how that's going to be effective.
[01:21:58.076 --> 01:21:59.617]  And now he says, no, it's not.
[01:22:02.739 --> 01:22:04.039]  Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.482]  And because of the Bidenflation, I mean, we have the numbers here from the Gateway Pundit story.
[01:22:12.224 --> 01:22:20.829]  Where states like California and Illinois are proposing giving you $300 a month to pay for gasoline.
[01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:23.143]  How about you just cut our taxes?
[01:22:24.944 --> 01:22:34.187]  The current average for gasoline is $4.23 for regular.
[01:22:35.607 --> 01:22:37.148]  A year ago, it was $2.87.
[01:22:38.308 --> 01:22:56.891]   And in fact, I believe they even have this broken down by... There was some story that they had broken down And basically, the price for gas has doubled since Biden got into office.
[01:22:59.453 --> 01:23:04.136]  And, uh, I'm not sure where that story went on my desk, but that's okay.
[01:23:05.897 --> 01:23:14.702]  The price per gallon has doubled since Joe Biden has been in office.
[01:23:14.722 --> 01:23:15.443]  Yeah, here it is right here.
[01:23:15.543 --> 01:23:16.143]  Election Day 2020.
[01:23:17.705 --> 01:23:18.386]  So that's November 2020.
[01:23:18.426 --> 01:23:18.886]  Gas was $2.11 per gallon.
[01:23:18.906 --> 01:23:21.729]  As of March 12th, just two weeks ago, gas was $4.34 a gallon.
[01:23:21.570 --> 01:23:33.489]   cents per gallon. As of March 12th, just two weeks ago, gas was $4.34 a gallon.
[01:23:33.489 --> 01:23:43.570]  So gas has literally doubled since Biden got into office.
[01:23:41.986 --> 01:23:43.766]  Now, we shouldn't be surprised by this.
[01:23:43.866 --> 01:23:45.286]  That's part of their policy.
[01:23:45.307 --> 01:23:48.567]  That was always part of their plan, their foreign policy and their domestic policy.
[01:23:49.708 --> 01:24:00.271]  So it's this weird thing where they get to have their cake and eat it too, where they virtue signal to the far liberal left saying, we're going to stop oil production.
[01:24:00.291 --> 01:24:01.431]  We're going to stop all gas.
[01:24:01.471 --> 01:24:03.812]  We're going to kill fossil fuel use in America.
[01:24:04.943 --> 01:24:06.746]  Well, okay, everybody knows what that means.
[01:24:07.146 --> 01:24:08.769]  You're not going to be able to afford to drive a car.
[01:24:09.269 --> 01:24:13.015]  Price per gallon is going to hit record highs, and energy prices are going to go up.
[01:24:13.255 --> 01:24:20.206]  Everybody knows that that's what's going to happen with your policy, and they just leave you to believe that, oh, it's worth it, you're saving the planet.
[01:24:21.735 --> 01:24:32.385]  But then they enact the policy, and you see the results, and you see the record high gas prices, and you're paying more for energy, and the prices are only going to keep going up.
[01:24:32.405 --> 01:24:34.827]  They're not going to go down anytime soon, they're just going to keep going up.
[01:24:36.148 --> 01:24:42.148]   And then they sit there and they say, "Oh, this isn't our fault, and we're going to help mitigate this,"
[01:24:42.148 --> 01:24:48.648]   even though it's their official policy that they brag about and promote.
[01:24:48.648 --> 01:24:58.148]  How much longer do we have to live in this clown world?
[01:24:58.148 --> 01:25:08.148]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:25:00.041 --> 01:25:04.524]  How much longer do we have to live in this nonsensical upside-down world?
[01:25:05.524 --> 01:25:08.826]  This illogical world of lies?
[01:25:10.607 --> 01:25:13.969]  The Biden administration says they will completely annihilate fossil fuels.
[01:25:14.370 --> 01:25:18.192]  The Biden administration blames Putin for the rising price of gasoline.
[01:25:19.293 --> 01:25:22.875]  And the media and Congress is just so pathetic, they just go along for the ride.
[01:25:23.075 --> 01:25:28.273]   You know, I don't want to How should I say this?
[01:25:31.315 --> 01:25:46.263]  As I'm sitting here covering all of this, a portion of my brain is constantly working in the background, thinking, strategizing, what are you doing preparing for this collapse right now?
[01:25:49.585 --> 01:26:02.405]   So it's just full disclosure here folks, I mean, I'm covering all this news, and I'd like to be happy-go-lucky and tell you everything's gonna be great, and we're gonna get through this, and I hope that's the case.
[01:26:03.946 --> 01:26:24.430]   But, I mean, just know, as I'm covering all this stuff, and the news is breaking, it's just, there's a portion of my brain, there's a percentage of my brain that's over here operating As I'm covering all this news, and it's just, how are you preparing?
[01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:25.270]  What are you doing?
[01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:27.690]  Are you ready for the collapse of the civilization?
[01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:29.190]  Are you ready for the collapse of America?
[01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:30.551]  Have you made the right measurements?
[01:26:30.591 --> 01:26:31.571]  Do you have what you need?
[01:26:31.651 --> 01:26:32.791]  Are you properly prepared?
[01:26:33.451 --> 01:26:50.494]  So, this is just more of a, just understand, this is real stuff, and if you're processing these same questions in your head, that is a normal response.
[01:26:54.209 --> 01:27:19.447]  Because, if this wasn't a battle for free speech, and for truth, and for the future of America and the planet, we'd probably just shut this whole thing down, and just say, okay, it's over, go get ready, go get right with God, go get right with your family, and go prepare for the next Great Depression, go prepare for the collapse of civilization.
[01:27:20.487 --> 01:27:36.513]   Again, I'm not, I don't want that to happen, I hope it doesn't happen, but you'd be stupid if you're not thinking about that or making proper preparations for that.
[01:27:38.154 --> 01:27:41.834]   So I mean it's just a constant tick in the back of my head as I'm covering this.
[01:27:41.834 --> 01:27:46.634]   Which we always have here because of the vampires sucking in our neck.
[01:27:46.634 --> 01:27:54.713]  It just sucks doesn't it?
[01:27:54.893 --> 01:28:00.197]  It just sucks to know that none of this is necessary.
[01:28:01.658 --> 01:28:04.060]  It just sucks to know that none of this has to be going on.
[01:28:05.321 --> 01:28:12.727]  It just sucks to know that we could still be a prosperous nation, and we'll have our problems, and we'll have our disagreements, and we'll have our corruption.
[01:28:12.787 --> 01:28:13.387]  But you know what?
[01:28:13.867 --> 01:28:16.449]  For the most part, you'll be in control of your destiny.
[01:28:19.011 --> 01:28:20.893]  And there's a bright future ahead.
[01:28:23.095 --> 01:28:23.475]  But no.
[01:28:27.315 --> 01:29:00.261]   No, we're living on a planet that is being dominated and occupied by demonic entities and corrupt individuals that are quite literally planning the collapse of civilization and they plan to ride it like a wave to a totalitarian system of control and a technotronic age Over all the people that are left on this planet for the rest of this planet's existence.
[01:29:03.442 --> 01:29:05.243]  And that's what's so heartbreaking about it.
[01:29:05.403 --> 01:29:09.624]  That's what sucks so much about this is that none of this needs to be going on, folks.
[01:29:10.524 --> 01:29:12.184]  All of this is totally unnecessary.
[01:29:12.224 --> 01:29:12.745]  But you know what?
[01:29:14.485 --> 01:29:21.947]  This is the challenge that God has given us with the gift of life and consciousness and everything that comes with it and all the beauty and splendor.
[01:29:23.817 --> 01:29:25.998]  That's the catch is that you're gonna have to deal with evil.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.102]  In a way, it's like the classic Beastie Boys song, you gotta fight for your right to party.
[01:29:33.122 --> 01:29:40.407]  It's like, hey, you gotta fight for your privilege of living on this planet free.
[01:29:40.967 --> 01:29:41.948]  It's not gonna be given to you.
[01:29:43.849 --> 01:29:48.948]   You're gonna be faced with demons, you're gonna be faced with Corruption.
[01:29:49.469 --> 01:29:55.753]  You're going to be faced with slavery and war and bondage and lies and propaganda.
[01:29:57.414 --> 01:30:01.416]  And it's the worst maybe it's ever been in the history of this planet right now.
[01:30:01.816 --> 01:30:05.358]  And it's just all unnecessary and it just breaks your heart to see what we're going into.
[01:30:06.299 --> 01:30:09.201]  Headline Washington examiner last month.
[01:30:10.461 --> 01:30:14.404]  Five times the White House said sanctions could deter Putin.
[01:30:15.785 --> 01:30:20.471]  And now here's Biden again today saying, the sanctions were never meant to deter Putin.
[01:30:21.993 --> 01:30:24.076]  And then Psaki was asked about this same thing.
[01:30:25.798 --> 01:30:30.784]  Biden claimed that no one expected sanctions to prevent Russian invasion was not exactly what he meant.
[01:30:31.578 --> 01:30:50.045]  Because remember, last month, in the same day, within hours of one another, Biden made a public statement saying the sanctions were never meant to deter Putin, and Psaki made a public statement saying the sanctions are meant to deter Putin, and so it's this miscommunication constantly with this joke of an administration, this clown show.
[01:30:52.086 --> 01:30:54.487]  Like, I just, I just, I don't get it.
[01:30:55.508 --> 01:30:58.929]  Are these people just filled with hatred in their heart?
[01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:01.430]  What is going on here?
[01:31:03.203 --> 01:31:05.084]  But I don't have time to sit here and pontificate.
[01:31:05.124 --> 01:31:06.525]  I need to cover the rest of this news.
[01:31:08.045 --> 01:31:12.367]  So let me just delve in to this stack of news over here.
[01:31:12.947 --> 01:31:16.109]  Now, I do believe you're going to start seeing more of this.
[01:31:17.129 --> 01:31:24.753]  You have probably one of the best third basemen in Major League Baseball.
[01:31:25.853 --> 01:31:28.935]  Definitely one of the better ballplayers, Manny Machado.
[01:31:30.165 --> 01:31:33.587]  He's doing an interview, and he's got a Let's Go Brandon shirt on.
[01:31:35.328 --> 01:31:36.649]  You know, here's what I've noticed, too.
[01:31:37.710 --> 01:31:42.593]  Hispanics are probably the most conservative group of people in America right now.
[01:31:42.993 --> 01:31:46.336]  Or maybe it's not even about conservative or liberal or anything.
[01:31:47.056 --> 01:31:49.398]  They get what's going on more than anybody else.
[01:31:51.519 --> 01:31:56.682]  And, you know, there's something there culturally, I think, with Christianity and Catholicism.
[01:31:57.871 --> 01:32:03.452]  And there might even still be like some, you know, cause it's a, they still have more of a historically close knit family unit.
[01:32:03.492 --> 01:32:07.093]  There might even be like pressure, like, Hey, you, you don't, you know, you don't be gay or anything like that.
[01:32:08.774 --> 01:32:10.734]  So they see all the Satanism going on.
[01:32:11.194 --> 01:32:16.055]  And I mean, you, you talk to the average Hispanic American that, I mean, as long as they're not totally brainwashed, like they get it.
[01:32:18.056 --> 01:32:18.856]  Uh, Manny Muchado.
[01:32:21.341 --> 01:32:23.822]  Baseball player with the Let's Go Brandon shirt on at spring training.
[01:32:24.062 --> 01:32:26.123]  I think that this is just the beginning, folks.
[01:32:26.343 --> 01:32:32.826]  I think athletes are going to slowly but surely start becoming more politically outspoken because they're just not going to have a choice.
[01:32:34.287 --> 01:32:36.748]  You don't think ball players like freedom like everybody else?
[01:32:36.788 --> 01:32:37.508]  Of course they do!
[01:32:39.209 --> 01:32:41.810]  You don't think ball players have family that are getting crushed by this stuff?
[01:32:46.075 --> 01:32:47.136]  I expect that to continue.
[01:32:48.376 --> 01:32:52.238]  Joe Biden has demanded the resignation of Dr. Oz.
[01:32:55.881 --> 01:32:58.562]  I know Dr. Oz is a bit of a polarizing figure.
[01:32:58.622 --> 01:33:10.809]  I'm not here to comment on the individual, but he was the President's Counsel on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, and he received an email today, Joe Biden demanding his resignation.
[01:33:13.459 --> 01:33:16.341]  Dr. Oz has responded, You don't believe in medical fascism?
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:21.039]   around anyone who doesn't completely fall in line with his fear-mongering, authoritarian,
[01:33:21.039 --> 01:33:23.320]  one-size-fits-all COVID handling.
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:25.801]  I am proud of my service and will not resign."
[01:33:25.801 --> 01:33:31.690]  So I imagine it'll be official by the end of today that Dr.
[01:33:31.690 --> 01:33:38.701]   Oz has been fired because he doesn't believe in medical fascism.
[01:33:38.701 --> 01:33:40.779]  You don't believe in medical fascism?
[01:33:40.779 --> 01:33:44.820]  You don't have a job in the Biden administration.
[01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:54.819]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:33:46.435 --> 01:33:48.516]  You're not a sexual deviant, you're probably not a Biden.
[01:33:49.316 --> 01:33:51.337]  Bill Barr, now this is an interesting one.
[01:33:51.357 --> 01:33:58.061]  Remember, Bill Barr was scolding Donald Trump for talking about the Hunter Biden email.
[01:33:59.622 --> 01:34:07.726]  And other such things, but on this story in particular, Bill Barr was part of the cover-up of the Hunter Biden laptop.
[01:34:08.787 --> 01:34:10.248]  Well now Bill Barr's upset!
[01:34:11.462 --> 01:34:14.103]  Because he was lied to by Joe Biden.
[01:34:14.664 --> 01:34:15.704]  Wow!
[01:34:16.565 --> 01:34:17.645]  Thought you were smart.
[01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:21.107]  Surprised by being lied to by Joe Biden?
[01:34:21.748 --> 01:34:27.431]  Bill Barr, Biden lied to the American people about his son Hunter's emails.
[01:34:28.671 --> 01:34:29.052]  Really?
[01:34:29.152 --> 01:34:39.918]  Joe Biden in an election year, when his son's devious activity is exposed and their own political corruption is exposed, Biden lied about that?
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:45.984]  The month before he was on a ballot to become President of the United States?
[01:34:46.564 --> 01:34:47.405]  He lied about that?
[01:34:47.705 --> 01:34:48.326]  Wow!
[01:34:49.526 --> 01:34:50.968]  Who could have seen that coming?
[01:34:52.309 --> 01:34:57.072]  Who could have seen Joe Biden lying about the laptop that shows he's guilty of all kinds of crimes?
[01:34:57.492 --> 01:35:02.456]  But Bill Barr's mad because he was lied to and he was deceived and now he's embarrassed.
[01:35:03.337 --> 01:35:06.299]  He's embarrassed that he was on the wrong side of that history.
[01:35:06.699 --> 01:35:07.760]  Please, Bill Barr.
[01:35:09.249 --> 01:35:11.090]  You knew the laptop was real.
[01:35:11.451 --> 01:35:12.671]  You helped cover it up.
[01:35:13.012 --> 01:35:14.853]  You're not getting any sympathy points here.
[01:35:16.174 --> 01:35:17.615]  Give me a break.
[01:35:20.437 --> 01:35:23.980]  But see, there's a great story here in Tablet Mag.
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:27.062]  Invasion of the Fact Checkers.
[01:35:28.783 --> 01:35:31.225]  And it's, you know, the laptop and everything.
[01:35:31.265 --> 01:35:32.726]  But basically, here's how the story goes.
[01:35:34.175 --> 01:35:42.778]  Fact checkers exist for one reason and one reason only, and that's to convince you that Democrats are never wrong about anything, ever.
[01:35:44.058 --> 01:35:46.779]  And Republicans are wrong about everything, ever.
[01:35:47.739 --> 01:35:53.361]  And that's kind of a blanket statement to lump everybody into one political side, but you get the gist of it.
[01:35:54.699 --> 01:35:56.240]  Invasion of the fact-checkers.
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:57.980]  Who are you going to believe?
[01:35:58.461 --> 01:36:04.563]  The Democrat Party's new official, unofficial, public, private, monopoly, tech, platform, censorship brigade?
[01:36:05.344 --> 01:36:09.686]  Or your own misinformed, disinformed eyes?
[01:36:11.406 --> 01:36:13.447]  There's no such thing as these fact-checkers.
[01:36:13.827 --> 01:36:24.012]  They're Democrat Party activists that only exist to tell you Democrats are never wrong about anything and Republicans are wrong about everything.
[01:36:25.934 --> 01:36:26.994]  Axios has the story.
[01:36:27.055 --> 01:36:27.955]  They're stunned, folks.
[01:36:28.375 --> 01:36:28.855]  They're stunned.
[01:36:30.116 --> 01:36:37.979]  Foreign propaganda organs, including those from Russia and China, have used a visa program designed to lure high-skilled workers to the U.S.
[01:36:38.059 --> 01:36:43.961]  to place reporters, editors, and producers at their American outposts' records show.
[01:36:44.682 --> 01:36:45.322]  Really?
[01:36:46.582 --> 01:36:47.503]  Who would have thought?
[01:36:47.563 --> 01:36:50.564]  Propagandist, plum, high-skilled visa program.
[01:36:52.142 --> 01:36:52.462]  Really?
[01:36:52.582 --> 01:36:55.684]  China sends propaganda agents to America?
[01:36:55.724 --> 01:36:56.625]  Like, oh, I don't know.
[01:36:57.065 --> 01:37:00.007]  Maybe we could ask Eric Swalwell about that.
[01:37:00.827 --> 01:37:02.228]  With his little fang-bang.
[01:37:04.169 --> 01:37:05.129]  This one's hilarious.
[01:37:06.630 --> 01:37:12.294]  Stormy Daniels must pay $300,000 to Donald Trump after losing defamation case appeal.
[01:37:14.335 --> 01:37:16.336]  Stormy Daniels has to pay Trump.
[01:37:20.253 --> 01:37:21.053]  That's hilarious.
[01:37:21.093 --> 01:37:26.815]  Now, of course, she won a case against Michael Avenatti, who for a hot minute was the hero of the Democrat Party.
[01:37:26.835 --> 01:37:27.895]  That all fell apart soon.
[01:37:28.695 --> 01:37:31.276]  That fell apart real quick, and then his criminal activity got exposed.
[01:37:31.796 --> 01:37:36.617]  He had to pay Stormy Daniels $300,000, and now that money is going right to Donald Trump.
[01:37:37.817 --> 01:37:42.178]  Another, the hitmen against Donald Trump fall on their own sword.
[01:37:44.258 --> 01:37:46.159]  Stormy Daniels and Michael Avenatti.
[01:37:47.657 --> 01:37:48.738]  Absolutely pathetic.
[01:37:49.378 --> 01:37:53.320]  Heroes of the Democrat Party end up being complete liars and losers.
[01:37:55.141 --> 01:38:01.084]  DOJ inadvertently publishes list of clients of Sarah Lawrence sex cult prostitute.
[01:38:02.165 --> 01:38:20.834]   New York City's elite are in a tizzy after the Justice Department inadvertently published a list of 121 clients including lawyers, businessmen, socialists who solicited Sarah Lawrence's sex cult victim Who was forced into prostitution.
[01:38:21.595 --> 01:38:23.997]  Yeah, folks, look, they're all in these sex cults.
[01:38:24.898 --> 01:38:29.281]  And, you know, maybe it's innocent enough, most of it, maybe some of it's used for blackmail.
[01:38:29.402 --> 01:38:31.343]  It's just, this is the political elite.
[01:38:32.284 --> 01:38:35.086]  This is the corporate elite.
[01:38:35.607 --> 01:38:41.211]  This is the lesser of the Jeffrey Epstein pedophile island sex trafficking operations.
[01:38:41.251 --> 01:38:44.654]  This is a couple notches below the Nixavum sex cult.
[01:38:44.754 --> 01:38:47.797]  But, I mean, it's eyes wide shut crap.
[01:38:49.042 --> 01:38:53.765]  Um, some, some celebrities and public figures have gone public about what happens.
[01:38:53.825 --> 01:39:14.240]  Like, yeah, they bring you into Hollywood parties, and they kind of slowly but surely, you know, introduce you to parties, and then, and then drugs, and then, and then more intense drugs, and then, and then the sex, and the prostitutes, and then the prostitutes get younger, and younger, and younger, and then, oh, it looks like an 18-year-old, oh, but no, she's 15, now you're blackmailed.
[01:39:16.274 --> 01:39:21.058]  But see, some people just dive right in because they like the sex cult stuff and they like having this weird orgy stuff.
[01:39:21.378 --> 01:39:25.181]  Some people get trapped into it, but it's all out there now.
[01:39:25.241 --> 01:39:28.984]  It's all getting exposed and the media just covers it up because they're involved.
[01:39:29.845 --> 01:39:33.568]  Alright, it is the final day of the Judge Jackson hearings.
[01:39:33.768 --> 01:39:46.434]   She's done nothing that would warrant her position on the Supreme Court bench, except maybe the fact that She was the judge that handled the Pizzagate shooter.
[01:39:47.394 --> 01:39:49.795]  And for obvious reasons, I'm just gonna leave it right there.
[01:39:52.075 --> 01:39:53.055]  But, uh, no.
[01:39:53.335 --> 01:39:59.617]  That's not the alarming thing, that she just happened to have the case of the Pizzagate shooter, and then the interesting history of that, gentlemen.
[01:40:00.557 --> 01:40:02.418]  We completely disavow any violence.
[01:40:04.778 --> 01:40:05.458]  And fake news.
[01:40:07.379 --> 01:40:09.819]  But no, that's- that's not what's so alarming.
[01:40:10.259 --> 01:40:12.220]  An interesting little rip- ripple there, but...
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:17.061]  It's her history protecting pedophiles.
[01:40:18.781 --> 01:40:22.362]  And it's so funny because I've got this clip and maybe I'll play it right now.
[01:40:24.382 --> 01:40:25.903]  We've got Cory Booker.
[01:40:26.883 --> 01:40:29.204]  And folks, I mean, this is just total clown show stuff.
[01:40:29.864 --> 01:40:37.866]  Here's Cory Booker comparing Judge Jackson to Harriet Tubman.
[01:40:40.006 --> 01:40:42.227]  I mean, it's just such ridiculousness.
[01:40:42.247 --> 01:40:43.067]  Do I even play it?
[01:40:44.534 --> 01:40:45.054]  But here you go.
[01:40:45.074 --> 01:40:46.475]  You want to see some of the clown show?
[01:40:47.195 --> 01:40:53.018]  Here's clown show Spartacus Cory Booker comparing Judge Jackson to Harriet Tubman.
[01:40:53.798 --> 01:40:54.458]  Harriet Tubman.
[01:40:56.979 --> 01:41:03.522]  I mean, she's one of my heroes because the more I read about this person, the more... This is ridiculous.
[01:41:03.562 --> 01:41:05.823]  She was viciously beaten.
[01:41:07.244 --> 01:41:09.025]  Her whole life she used to fall into spells.
[01:41:09.145 --> 01:41:09.885]  Cracked skull.
[01:41:12.915 --> 01:41:15.337]  She faced starvation, chased by dogs.
[01:41:15.497 --> 01:41:26.807]  I mean, folks... So he's here talking about the torture Harriet Tubman had to endure as if he's trying to get a lead role in a thespian class or something.
[01:41:27.588 --> 01:41:28.489]  Spartacus Booker.
[01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:29.950]  I mean, this guy's as phony as a $3 bill.
[01:41:32.503 --> 01:41:34.463]  Just the over-exaggeration of everything.
[01:41:34.663 --> 01:41:37.064]  And he's always sitting there, oh Harriet Tubman, beating and all this stuff.
[01:41:37.744 --> 01:41:39.904]  You're gonna compare that to Judge Jackson?
[01:41:40.364 --> 01:41:45.505]  Who literally has gotten everywhere she is in life because of her skin color, including the Supreme Court?
[01:41:46.946 --> 01:41:48.366]  And you're gonna compare the two?
[01:41:49.866 --> 01:41:51.867]  Like, I'm seeing people comparing her to Rosa Parks.
[01:41:52.347 --> 01:42:08.107]   So, you're gonna make the historical comparison to black Americans Who were punished for their skin color, and you're going to say that that's the same as someone who's been rewarded for their skin color?
[01:42:08.847 --> 01:42:11.388]  Again, I'm just, it's just total clown world.
[01:42:11.628 --> 01:42:15.389]  Here, let's see how long you can put up with the clown Cory Booker here.
[01:42:16.329 --> 01:42:21.650]  She, rest knows she went back again and again and again.
[01:42:23.450 --> 01:42:29.572]  The star was, the sky was full of stars, but she found one that was a harbinger of hope.
[01:42:31.581 --> 01:42:37.444]  For better days, not just for her and those people that were enslaved, but a harbinger of hope for this country.
[01:42:37.464 --> 01:42:38.865]  And she never gave up on America.
[01:42:39.525 --> 01:42:44.168]  She fought and led troops in the Civil War.
[01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:48.891]  She was involved in the suffrage movement.
[01:42:51.352 --> 01:42:57.115]  And as I came back from my run, after being near assaulted by someone on the street.
[01:42:57.696 --> 01:42:58.936]  Oh yeah, I'm sure that happened.
[01:42:58.956 --> 01:42:59.677]  I thought about her.
[01:43:00.805 --> 01:43:01.566]  Oh my gosh.
[01:43:01.606 --> 01:43:02.346]  Now she looked up.
[01:43:02.446 --> 01:43:03.327]  She kept looking up.
[01:43:03.387 --> 01:43:05.769]  No matter what they did to her, she never stopped looking up.
[01:43:05.889 --> 01:43:07.109]  Now he's Harriet Tubman.
[01:43:07.129 --> 01:43:13.814]  And that star... It was a harbinger of hope.
[01:43:15.475 --> 01:43:16.316]  Oh my gosh.
[01:43:16.336 --> 01:43:17.196]  Today, you're my star.
[01:43:19.358 --> 01:43:20.659]  You are my harbinger of hope.
[01:43:23.544 --> 01:43:26.406]  This country is getting better and better and better.
[01:43:26.906 --> 01:43:27.326]  Really?
[01:43:27.346 --> 01:43:28.027]  For who?
[01:43:28.067 --> 01:43:31.289]  And when that final vote happens... I've never heard him say that before.
[01:43:31.309 --> 01:43:36.132]  And you ascend onto the... onto the highest court in the land.
[01:43:37.572 --> 01:43:38.473]  I'm gonna rejoice.
[01:43:39.914 --> 01:43:40.294]  Wow.
[01:43:41.355 --> 01:43:44.717]  Talk about a psychotic mess.
[01:43:46.963 --> 01:43:48.044]  Cory Booker.
[01:43:48.264 --> 01:43:55.449]  So Cory Booker has now compared himself to Spartacus and Harriet Tubman.
[01:43:59.252 --> 01:44:06.157]  This is just... That's what I'm saying, folks, is I just don't want to deal with these people anymore.
[01:44:06.638 --> 01:44:06.978]  I don't.
[01:44:07.078 --> 01:44:07.638]  I'm done with you.
[01:44:07.678 --> 01:44:09.259]  I don't want to deal with the... I don't care.
[01:44:09.319 --> 01:44:10.480]  Cory Booker, you go out.
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:11.401]  You do your thing.
[01:44:11.461 --> 01:44:12.142]  Whatever that is.
[01:44:13.117 --> 01:44:14.258]  Whatever your thing is, man.
[01:44:14.298 --> 01:44:15.298]  You're Harriet Tubman.
[01:44:15.639 --> 01:44:16.519]  You're Spartacus.
[01:44:16.539 --> 01:44:17.600]  You're Jesus Christ.
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:18.681]  You're Mahatma Gandhi.
[01:44:19.261 --> 01:44:21.162]  You're Nelson Mandela.
[01:44:21.222 --> 01:44:24.885]  You're Han Solo.
[01:44:25.265 --> 01:44:26.846]  I mean, you're all of it, dude.
[01:44:26.886 --> 01:44:27.826]  You're the greatest thing ever.
[01:44:29.247 --> 01:44:31.129]  I don't want to deal with these people anymore.
[01:44:31.749 --> 01:44:33.730]  Can you just leave us alone, please?
[01:44:35.892 --> 01:44:37.973]  They'll never leave us alone.
[01:44:39.834 --> 01:44:40.795]  That's the problem here.
[01:44:45.299 --> 01:44:53.323]  You see, the American left can't exist politically without you to subjugate.
[01:44:56.964 --> 01:45:02.367]  The American left and its political policies cannot exist without subjects.
[01:45:02.727 --> 01:45:09.110]  They need someone to tax, they need someone to censor, they need someone to demonize, they need someone to arrest.
[01:45:11.011 --> 01:45:14.833]  All of their policy is based off needing somebody to subjugate.
[01:45:15.694 --> 01:45:17.494]  We just want to be left alone, man.
[01:45:18.135 --> 01:45:19.015]  But they need us.
[01:45:18.855 --> 01:45:20.855]  Their policies need us!
[01:45:20.855 --> 01:45:25.855]  [silence]
[01:45:25.855 --> 01:45:30.855]   Harrison... or excuse me, I'm thinking Harrison Ford, Han Solo.
[01:45:31.318 --> 01:45:32.818]  Cory Booker is Han Solo.
[01:45:32.878 --> 01:45:36.599]  Cory Booker is Luke Skywalker.
[01:45:36.959 --> 01:45:39.139]  Cory Booker is Rosa Parks.
[01:45:39.199 --> 01:45:40.900]  Cory Booker is Spartacus.
[01:45:43.424 --> 01:45:45.445]  Cory Booker is Hercules!
[01:45:46.505 --> 01:45:49.986]  And this is just, it's just complete clown show stuff!
[01:45:51.907 --> 01:45:53.728]  Go do your clown shows, bro!
[01:45:54.248 --> 01:45:56.529]  Just, please, leave us alone!
[01:45:57.729 --> 01:45:59.290]  But no, they'll never leave us alone.
[01:46:02.011 --> 01:46:10.994]  Here's Senator Howley highlighting Judge Jackson saying that sex abusers are victims in this country.
[01:46:11.014 --> 01:46:11.674]  I'm not even kidding you.
[01:46:14.035 --> 01:46:17.637]  Here it is from one of her cases where she let a pedophile off the hook.
[01:46:19.277 --> 01:46:23.979]  I feel so sorry for them and for you and for the anguish that this has caused all of you.
[01:46:24.039 --> 01:46:25.500]  That's the sex offender.
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:26.740]  That's the pedophile.
[01:46:28.181 --> 01:46:31.783]  I also feel terrible about the collateral consequences of this conviction.
[01:46:33.083 --> 01:46:38.305]  Sex offenders are truly shunned in our society and I have no control over these collateral consequences.
[01:46:40.546 --> 01:46:42.107]  That's the comments from Judge Jackson.
[01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:52.634]  See, this is more of how the liberal left ideology and logic is absolutely illogical and really double-think.
[01:46:52.814 --> 01:47:01.099]  So, who really makes it a national cause to shun sex offenders in our society?
[01:47:01.139 --> 01:47:02.940]  Well, that'd be the Women's March.
[01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:04.481]  That'd be the Me Too movement, right?
[01:47:05.538 --> 01:47:06.999]  Of course, if you're a Democrat, it's all good.
[01:47:07.039 --> 01:47:07.699]  You're Bill Clinton.
[01:47:07.779 --> 01:47:08.499]  You can rape women.
[01:47:08.559 --> 01:47:09.139]  It's all good.
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:11.580]  You're Democrats in Virginia.
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:14.021]  You're Joe Biden with Tara Reade.
[01:47:14.501 --> 01:47:15.342]  You're the Cuomos.
[01:47:15.442 --> 01:47:15.962]  It's all good.
[01:47:16.002 --> 01:47:19.763]  It's only if a Republican is accused or a conservative is accused that they care so much.
[01:47:19.803 --> 01:47:20.604]  But that's not even the point.
[01:47:21.284 --> 01:47:27.106]  They're the ones that claim any sex offender needs to be shunned from society, worst person ever.
[01:47:28.206 --> 01:47:34.689]  Here's your judge, Jackson nominee, saying that sex offenders are the victims in this country.
[01:47:37.162 --> 01:47:39.063]  Where's your logic, liberals?
[01:47:39.243 --> 01:47:40.684]  Where's your logic, Democrats?
[01:47:43.266 --> 01:47:45.907]  Seriously, how much more phoniness do you need to see from these people?
[01:47:46.948 --> 01:47:54.113]  Just look at the Kavanaugh hearings, where they made up allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, saying he should be shunned for sex offenses.
[01:47:54.753 --> 01:48:00.336]  Now they're about to nominate a judge who thinks it's bad that sex offenders are shunned.
[01:48:01.597 --> 01:48:02.838]  I'm done with these people, man!
[01:48:03.258 --> 01:48:04.679]  I just want them out of our lives!
[01:48:09.468 --> 01:48:24.659]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:48:28.122 --> 01:48:33.906]  So in the break, I'm watching an old clip of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings.
[01:48:35.382 --> 01:48:36.662]  It's just so frustrating, man.
[01:48:36.722 --> 01:48:39.163]  These Democrats, Joe Biden, they've never changed.
[01:48:39.223 --> 01:48:41.484]  They have literally never changed, folks.
[01:48:42.204 --> 01:48:43.044]  They've never changed.
[01:48:45.225 --> 01:48:51.026]  And you know, the great one, Rush Limbaugh, would always say this.
[01:48:51.827 --> 01:49:00.619]   It was always one of his most One of the most fierce talking points was how the Democrats have never changed, they've always been this way.
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:05.423]  It's just more and more as time goes on, people start to realize what evil monsters they are.
[01:49:06.423 --> 01:49:09.386]  So I'm going to play it on the War Room coming up that I'm hosting at 3pm.
[01:49:10.887 --> 01:49:15.150]  Just a reminder, what they did to Brett Kavanaugh, they did to Clarence Thomas.
[01:49:17.211 --> 01:49:18.332]  These are sick bastards.
[01:49:19.593 --> 01:49:22.155]  These are demonic monsters.
[01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:40.895]  And see, my problem is, I'm so sick and damn tired of these people, I just want to step up, unplug my earpiece, shut off the microphone, walk out of this studio, and just be done with it.
[01:49:42.876 --> 01:49:46.597]  But I can't do that because who else is going to fight these monsters?
[01:49:48.424 --> 01:49:50.226]  Who else is going to expose these monsters?
[01:49:50.266 --> 01:49:55.430]  Who else is going to sit here and take the bullets and the flak and the arrows and the shrapnel from these monsters?
[01:49:58.112 --> 01:50:06.439]  I mean, they've already got the fishhook spear into my side, trying to put me on board of their prison boat.
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:12.905]  They've already got vampires and... I just...
[01:50:16.101 --> 01:50:17.747]  Let me just stop right there and cover this news.
[01:50:19.787 --> 01:50:20.647]  It's not even about me.
[01:50:21.088 --> 01:50:23.689]  I'm so sick of these people destroying our planet.
[01:50:24.109 --> 01:50:27.611]  I'm so sick of these people destroying our way of life, destroying our country.
[01:50:28.031 --> 01:50:29.632]  None of this has to be going on, folks.
[01:50:29.872 --> 01:50:30.212]  None of it.
[01:50:30.573 --> 01:50:32.153]  Infowars doesn't have to exist.
[01:50:32.654 --> 01:50:34.475]  You don't have to be getting crushed at the pump.
[01:50:34.835 --> 01:50:36.756]  You don't have to be getting crushed with taxes.
[01:50:37.336 --> 01:50:43.679]  You don't have to deal with pedophile drag queen story times and gay pride parade for kids and fake news.
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:44.460]  None of it.
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:45.200]  None of it.
[01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:46.981]  We shouldn't be dealing with any of it.
[01:50:47.581 --> 01:50:48.502]  It should all be done.
[01:50:50.213 --> 01:50:50.994]  Should be over with!
[01:50:51.794 --> 01:50:52.675]  See, that's why I need to stop.
[01:50:52.735 --> 01:50:56.298]  Because I just, I lose my patience, I lose my temper, I pray to God I'm not going to do it anymore.
[01:50:56.878 --> 01:51:00.941]  I'm sure I will fall short of that, but... That's what I'm saying.
[01:51:00.961 --> 01:51:02.483]  You just, you just go back in time.
[01:51:03.704 --> 01:51:04.284]  And you just look.
[01:51:04.644 --> 01:51:06.666]  These people have never changed.
[01:51:06.906 --> 01:51:09.768]  Joe Biden has always been a lying monster!
[01:51:10.649 --> 01:51:13.391]  Hillary Clinton has always been a lying monster!
[01:51:14.732 --> 01:51:19.276]  The Democrat Party has always been a bunch of monstrous terrorist demons!
[01:51:21.693 --> 01:51:24.736]  I apologize, I promised I wouldn't do that, so let me just get into the news.
[01:51:27.057 --> 01:51:37.446]  By the way, we'll cover the Clarence Thomas clip on The War Room, and also we're gonna have Christy Lee joining us in the field from a gay pride parade for kids!
[01:51:37.786 --> 01:51:39.788]  That's what I'm gonna start doing, actually, I think.
[01:51:39.848 --> 01:51:40.768]  I was thinking about this, too.
[01:51:42.130 --> 01:51:45.612]  Maybe it's just time to go straight comical here, straight satire here.
[01:51:46.753 --> 01:51:52.378]   And I'm just gonna be a leftist liberal, and I'm gonna celebrate Drag queen story time.
[01:51:52.418 --> 01:51:54.800]  And I'm going to celebrate gay pride parade for kids.
[01:51:55.080 --> 01:51:58.322]  And I'm going to celebrate medical fascism and tyranny.
[01:51:58.362 --> 01:51:59.543]  Because here's what I've realized.
[01:52:02.305 --> 01:52:08.610]  There is no effective way of changing a liberal's heart or mind.
[01:52:09.090 --> 01:52:09.771]  It's not going to happen.
[01:52:10.872 --> 01:52:19.255]   But what you can do Is you can embody their beliefs, and their politics, and their ideologies, and their logic.
[01:52:19.655 --> 01:52:28.500]  You can embody that, and you can put on the demon avatar suit of a Democrat liberal progressive, and you can just go to their events and say, this is great!
[01:52:29.021 --> 01:52:30.281]  I love gay kids!
[01:52:31.082 --> 01:52:45.945]   Because see, when they see that coming out of your mouth, and when they see you promoting their sycophant ideas and ideologies, Then they'll have to push back against it and realize how evil it is.
[01:52:45.985 --> 01:52:46.665]  See how that works?
[01:52:47.005 --> 01:53:00.808]  It's a level of reverse psychology, but it's deeper because their drive to hate us is actually more powerful than their actual ideologies.
[01:53:02.348 --> 01:53:03.208]  So I say, good.
[01:53:04.069 --> 01:53:05.829]  Let's chop little boys' balls off.
[01:53:07.301 --> 01:53:14.903]  And let's have gay pride parades, and let's teach 10-year-olds how to masturbate with one another, and let's even have live masturbation classes!
[01:53:15.583 --> 01:53:23.745]  And let's give them dildos and vibrators and sex toys, and let's show them how to use them, and they can't even, you know, they don't even have gone through puberty yet, but this is a good thing!
[01:53:23.765 --> 01:53:30.647]  So that's what I'm saying, it's like, maybe we just do satire now, and just come out, and I'm just pro all the liberal ideology.
[01:53:30.947 --> 01:53:35.008]   I want World War III with Russia, I want nuclear war with Russia.
[01:53:35.268 --> 01:53:40.332]  I want little kids being taught how to have gay sex and anal sex and use dildos and everything.
[01:53:40.352 --> 01:53:41.133]  I think it's all good.
[01:53:42.514 --> 01:53:49.519]  And I think that pedophiles and child porn rapists and distributors of that material should get light sentences.
[01:53:50.239 --> 01:53:50.840]  Absolutely.
[01:53:52.281 --> 01:53:56.584]  And I agree, we should censor people that have speech that I disagree with.
[01:53:56.864 --> 01:54:00.907]  And I think we should have forced medical procedures.
[01:54:01.107 --> 01:54:01.668]  Absolutely.
[01:54:02.432 --> 01:54:15.215]  But see, that's what I'm saying is when you introduce that doctrine and you propose that to them as if you're in support of it, their entire brain and soul just starts to malfunction.
[01:54:19.315 --> 01:54:23.636]  Donald Trump sues Hillary Clinton and others over Russian collusion allegations.
[01:54:24.837 --> 01:54:25.917]  That's an interesting move.
[01:54:27.197 --> 01:54:28.357]  We'll see what comes of that.
[01:54:33.188 --> 01:54:37.291]  Donald Trump sues Hillary Clinton and others over Russia collusion allegations.
[01:54:37.332 --> 01:54:38.212]  I hope he has good lawyers.
[01:54:39.233 --> 01:54:40.214]  And I hope we get discovery.
[01:54:41.695 --> 01:54:43.617]  Because we all know what happened there.
[01:54:44.437 --> 01:54:44.858]  Don't we?
[01:54:45.899 --> 01:54:46.900]  Don't we indeed?
[01:54:48.661 --> 01:54:52.064]  Project Veritas says Fed secretly accessed its emails.
[01:54:53.985 --> 01:54:54.626]  Totally illegal.
[01:54:55.267 --> 01:55:01.412]  NYPD over DNA database that contains genetic profiles of innocent New Yorkers sued.
[01:55:02.918 --> 01:55:10.061]  Yeah, well, wait till you figure out what they did with your nasal swab from your COVID test.
[01:55:11.381 --> 01:55:12.702]  Wait till you figure that one out.
[01:55:14.022 --> 01:55:16.163]  Then you'll really know what's going on.
[01:55:17.804 --> 01:55:22.965]  It is not just them collecting random DNA samples.
[01:55:23.025 --> 01:55:26.987]  They are collecting it any which way they can.
[01:55:30.287 --> 01:55:31.347]  Where do I want to go next?
[01:55:31.427 --> 01:55:50.394]  I mean, I just got this stack of gay pride parade for kids and pedophile story time for kids and it's just all great and they block parents out from going into the building because they don't like their kids being taught how to have gay sex and they don't like their kids being taught how to be racist and so the schools just say, oh, parents are banned, you can't come in.
[01:55:52.154 --> 01:55:54.635]  You're not allowed to be here and then they get arrested when they try.
[01:55:54.675 --> 01:55:56.376]  It's, you know, it's liberals, it's a good thing.
[01:55:58.454 --> 01:56:12.785]  I love this story from Spencer Clavin at The American Mind, and while I agree with the content of the story, the headline is, Creating Conspiracy Theorists, Turning Basic Facts Into Thought Crimes Turns Normal People Into Thought Criminals.
[01:56:13.406 --> 01:56:27.817]  And it's, you know, you get the idea, but here's the thing, it's not that the radical left or the fake news media or all this other garbage is turning people into conspiracy theorists, it's that the conspiracy theorists were right.
[01:56:29.397 --> 01:56:30.397]  That's the headline.
[01:56:31.838 --> 01:56:41.162]  The madness of the fake news media and the liberal left progressives and the Judge Jackson taking it easy on pedophiles saying they're the victims.
[01:56:42.482 --> 01:56:44.123]  That's not creating conspiracy theorists.
[01:56:44.923 --> 01:56:47.784]  That's confirming that the conspiracy theorists were right.
[01:56:47.924 --> 01:56:51.406]  So that's the real headline is conspiracy theorists were right.
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:57:12.345]  But I understand the notion that he proposes in the story is basically like, when you say men are women, when you say obese people are healthy, when you say kids need to be sexualized, when you hide the Hunter Biden laptop and all this stuff, when you lie about Russian collusion, you're creating conspiracy theorists, but it's really just the conspiracy theorists were right all along, now you're just starting to realize it.
[01:57:16.667 --> 01:57:21.088]  Newt Gingrich says Kamala Harris may be the dumbest person ever elected vice president.
[01:57:22.622 --> 01:57:23.563]  Probably right about that.
[01:57:24.004 --> 01:57:32.893]  George Soros showing his love and support for Madeleine Albright as she went down to we know where yesterday.
[01:57:33.153 --> 01:57:37.778]  George Soros says she was an astute stateswoman, a scholar, a champion for freedom and democracy.
[01:57:38.119 --> 01:57:42.143]  Yeah, she bombed people in Serbia where she supposedly was a rescued Jew came from.
[01:57:42.443 --> 01:57:48.482]   So two self-loathing Jews That basically acted like Nazis their whole life.
[01:57:48.522 --> 01:57:50.063]  They look like they could be related too.
[01:57:51.063 --> 01:57:53.004]  Celebrating Madeleine Albright, a war criminal.
[01:57:53.764 --> 01:57:58.366]  Well this is the final segment for me today on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:59.027 --> 01:58:00.347]  Here at InfoWars.
[01:58:01.528 --> 01:58:07.850]  Fighting corruption, lies, with the sword of truth.
[01:58:10.291 --> 01:58:11.712]  And the shield of information.
[01:58:13.416 --> 01:58:16.540]  Right out of the InfoWars World Headquarters here in Austin, Texas.
[01:58:17.842 --> 01:58:20.365]  Folks, don't take this transmission for granted.
[01:58:20.645 --> 01:58:22.487]  Do not take InfoWars for granted.
[01:58:22.988 --> 01:58:25.351]  Support us by shopping at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:58:25.431 --> 01:58:26.933]  Remember to spread the links as well.
[01:58:28.479 --> 01:58:35.923]  And here would be my message to those that have supported us over the years and have spent a lot of your hard-earned money here to keep us on the air.
[01:58:36.684 --> 01:58:38.405]  We can't say thank you enough.
[01:58:39.185 --> 01:59:08.654]   But to those that are tuned in and have never shopped at InfoWarsTore.com and never supported us financially, don't sit on the sidelines any longer because You don't want the day to come where you tune into InfoWars and it's no longer there, and you think, man, I just wish I would have purchased toothpaste from their store, or wish I would have purchased their coffee, or gotten some emergency food supplies, or an air filter, or a water filter, or some of their supplements, or made a donation, because they're not here anymore.
[01:59:10.114 --> 01:59:14.855]  Your prayers, your sharing of the video links, it's what keeps us on the air, folks.
[01:59:16.416 --> 01:59:16.896]  But, um...
[01:59:20.239 --> 01:59:30.061]  I don't know when Alex is going to be able to come back on air, and I'm not sure how much of the behind-the-scenes stuff he's going to want to talk about with the attacks we're under.
[01:59:31.682 --> 01:59:36.023]  But, I mean, it's serious stuff here, folks.
[01:59:36.183 --> 01:59:49.866]  And that's why it's such a distraction to deal with all of that, and it's such a challenge to even come on air and be effective with all of this stuff going on and the thoughts churning in the back of your mind of how you're going to deal with it, are you even going to last?
[01:59:50.350 --> 02:00:01.680]  They're going to try to crush you, imprison you, but you still have to just put all that in the back of your mind and try to be as informative as possible here.
[02:00:05.564 --> 02:00:08.887]  But just know that we need more support now than ever.
[02:00:10.829 --> 02:00:11.810]  We're not going to beg for it.
[02:00:12.674 --> 02:00:13.894]  But just know that that's the case.
[02:00:13.994 --> 02:00:14.755]  And we make it easy.
[02:00:14.815 --> 02:00:15.855]  We've got great supplements.
[02:00:15.915 --> 02:00:18.236]  Who doesn't want a strong immune system?
[02:00:18.696 --> 02:00:20.417]  Who doesn't want to have a good immune system?
[02:00:20.677 --> 02:00:23.538]  Especially in this day and age with man-made viruses getting released.
[02:00:24.838 --> 02:00:28.019]  Immune Support Formula at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:00:32.961 --> 02:00:34.381]  Very popular around here.

[02:01:05.461 --> 02:01:10.484]  I've got a couple other news stories and video clips to play here, and then Paul Joseph Watson hosts the fourth hour.
[02:01:10.504 --> 02:01:12.104]  I'll be back hosting the War Room.
[02:01:12.505 --> 02:01:21.309]  Live guest, Christy Lee, from the site of a children's gay pride parade where they block parents out from going in to try to stop it.
[02:01:21.329 --> 02:01:22.590]  I'm not even kidding you, that's how bad it is.
[02:01:23.490 --> 02:01:30.394]  Russian Ministry of Defense, Hunter Biden, George Soros, Pentagon, and CDC involved in Ukrainian biolabs.
[02:01:31.647 --> 02:01:34.729]  Yeah, now you see what is really going on with Russia and Ukraine.
[02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:44.237]  They don't want the corrupt West with the Bidens and Soroses running biological weapons labs on their doorstep.
[02:01:44.777 --> 02:01:47.499]  US to accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees.
[02:01:47.779 --> 02:01:48.380]  Oh, that's great!
[02:01:48.420 --> 02:01:51.122]  So we brought in all the Afghani refugees.
[02:01:51.522 --> 02:01:54.024]  Now we're bringing all the Ukrainian refugees.
[02:01:54.324 --> 02:01:59.028]  Not to mention we're on pace for 2 million illegal immigrant border crossings this year.
[02:01:59.168 --> 02:01:59.669]  It's great!
[02:01:59.949 --> 02:02:01.190]  You're paying for all of it, too.
[02:02:02.816 --> 02:02:09.579]  You can't even afford gas anymore, your energy bills are going up, everything's going up, but you're gonna pay for people to come invade your country too.
[02:02:09.979 --> 02:02:11.580]  Do you like living in the clown world?
[02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:12.760]  Is it fun or what?
[02:02:14.061 --> 02:02:14.681]  What a great time.
[02:02:15.561 --> 02:02:25.037]   Here's Justin Trudeau getting called out By MP Mislav Kolisic from Croatia.
[02:02:25.737 --> 02:02:32.362]  Listen to this stunning endorsement, I say, I say jokingly, in clip two.
[02:02:36.105 --> 02:02:40.048]  Unfortunately today, there are those who trample on fundamental values.
[02:02:40.609 --> 02:02:51.948]   Canada, once a symbol of the modern world, has become a symbol of civil rights violations.
[02:02:51.948 --> 02:03:05.088]   Under your quasi-liberal boot in recent months, we watched how you trample women with horses,
[02:03:05.088 --> 02:03:11.648]   how you block the bank accounts of single parents so that they can't even pay their
[02:03:11.648 --> 02:03:22.529]   children's education and medicine, that they can't pay utilities, mortgages for their homes.
[02:03:23.252 --> 02:03:26.255]  To you, these may be liberal methods.
[02:03:27.036 --> 02:03:30.439]  For many citizens of the world, it is a dictatorship.
[02:03:31.667 --> 02:03:31.807]  Wow.
[02:03:31.646 --> 02:03:34.707]  of the worst kind.
[02:03:34.707 --> 02:03:40.646]   Rest assured that the citizens of the world, united, can stop any regime that wants to
[02:03:40.646 --> 02:03:50.326]   destroy the freedom of citizens either by bombs or harmful pharmaceutical products.
[02:03:50.326 --> 02:03:51.326]  Thank you.
[02:03:51.326 --> 02:03:52.326]  Wow.
[02:03:52.326 --> 02:03:55.886]  That lays it all out right there.
[02:03:55.886 --> 02:04:00.287]   And by the way, Trudeau is just getting scolded by his own parliament now, too.
[02:04:00.712 --> 02:04:05.073]  There is a lady, I keep forgetting her name, I think it's, uh, is it Christina Legrand, maybe?
[02:04:06.053 --> 02:04:12.195]  The blonde lady in Canada's parliament, who now, to me, has to be the frontrunner to replace Trudeau.
[02:04:12.936 --> 02:04:14.096]  She's just been incredible.
[02:04:16.157 --> 02:04:18.798]   And then, This is hilarious.
[02:04:18.938 --> 02:04:22.379]  In Slovakia, they basically had their parliamentary meeting.
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:36.724]  This was like at the State of the Union, essentially, would be the best, maybe not the best analogy, but it's the best I can come up with, where all the Democrats and Republicans were all waving the Ukraine flag, dressed in Ukraine colors, and half the State of the Union was about Ukraine.
[02:04:38.065 --> 02:04:39.005]  Shows you what they really want.
[02:04:39.045 --> 02:04:41.466]  So here's members of the Slovakian Parliament.
[02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:53.975]  Waving the Ukrainian flag in the parliamentary building and the Slovakian patriots put their own flag on top of it, poured water on the masked individuals.
[02:04:53.995 --> 02:04:54.976]  Of course they're wearing masks.
[02:04:55.076 --> 02:04:56.937]  These are the brainwashed minions of the New World Order.
[02:04:56.957 --> 02:05:00.378]  Wearing masks, holding the Ukraine flag the wrong way, upside down.
[02:05:00.418 --> 02:05:01.919]  It just shows you how they don't even know anything.
[02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:04.060]  The blue part goes on top.
[02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:05.201]  It represents the sky.
[02:05:05.221 --> 02:05:06.361]  The yellow part goes on bottom.
[02:05:06.401 --> 02:05:07.282]  It represents the crops.
[02:05:08.382 --> 02:05:09.303]  They don't even know the basics.
[02:05:10.205 --> 02:05:14.487]  And then it's so funny because you watch the Slovenian patriots are the ones not wearing masks.
[02:05:14.807 --> 02:05:19.530]  They pour water on these deranged leftists that are holding the Ukraine flag upside down.
[02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:23.612]  And none of the Slovenians waving the Slovenian flag are wearing masks.
[02:05:23.692 --> 02:05:27.093]  I mean, this right here is everything in a nutshell.
[02:05:29.554 --> 02:05:31.035]  You have pride in your own country.
[02:05:31.055 --> 02:05:32.356]  You have nothing to do with Ukraine.
[02:05:33.550 --> 02:05:36.294]  You're not wearing a mask because you don't fall for that propaganda either.
[02:05:36.314 --> 02:05:37.055]  So it's the same thing.
[02:05:37.355 --> 02:05:39.358]  You're not falling for the Ukraine propaganda.
[02:05:39.538 --> 02:05:40.860]  You're waving your own flag.
[02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:43.263]  You're not falling for the COVID hysteria.
[02:05:43.363 --> 02:05:44.465]  You're not wearing a mask.
[02:05:44.805 --> 02:05:45.326]  They are.
[02:05:45.887 --> 02:05:47.289]  They're waving the Ukraine flag.
[02:05:47.449 --> 02:05:48.490]  They're wearing their masks.
[02:05:48.610 --> 02:05:50.914]  They support whatever the current propaganda thing is.
[02:05:52.270 --> 02:05:52.930]  Amazing stuff.
[02:05:53.751 --> 02:05:54.672]  Just amazing stuff.
[02:05:55.212 --> 02:05:56.493]  Now here you are in clip four.
[02:05:56.953 --> 02:06:02.837]  Listen to what BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has to say in clip four.
[02:06:03.617 --> 02:06:06.879]  Behaviors are going to have to change and this is one thing we're asking companies.
[02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:12.583]  You have to force behaviors and at BlackRock we are forcing behaviors.
[02:06:15.284 --> 02:06:16.025]  See what it's all about?
[02:06:16.105 --> 02:06:21.028]  That's echoing the sentiments of Klaus Schwab and the Great Reset.
[02:06:22.219 --> 02:06:25.665]  Forcing behaviors like you're not going to drive a car anymore.
[02:06:27.167 --> 02:06:28.690]  You're not going to own a house anymore.
[02:06:29.431 --> 02:06:31.635]  You're not going to fly and travel the world anymore.
[02:06:32.256 --> 02:06:34.980]  You're not going to have steak and potatoes for dinner anymore.
[02:06:36.049 --> 02:06:46.201]  You're going to have to change your behaviors, because the corrupt elite of this planet that want to conquer it for themselves and hoard all the resources, that's how they look at it.
[02:06:46.261 --> 02:06:47.222]  The planet is theirs.
[02:06:47.803 --> 02:06:49.164]  They're in charge of the resources.
[02:06:49.204 --> 02:06:52.128]  They own and operate all the resources.
[02:06:52.188 --> 02:06:54.651]  You're not allowed access to it unless they say you can.
[02:06:55.987 --> 02:07:03.213]  And man-made climate change is the big myth, the big lie for the greater good that they're going to use to dominate you, conquer you, and enslave you.
[02:07:03.454 --> 02:07:05.175]  And they're going to force you to change your behaviors.
[02:07:05.515 --> 02:07:07.197]  That's why your gas price is going up.
[02:07:07.757 --> 02:07:09.319]  That's why your taxes are going up.
[02:07:10.019 --> 02:07:11.641]  That's why they're censoring free speech.
[02:07:11.861 --> 02:07:12.502]  It's all the same.
[02:07:12.922 --> 02:07:14.664]  They're forcing you to be a slave.
[02:07:14.944 --> 02:07:20.511]   They're forcing you into the behavioral Aspects of being a slave.
[02:07:21.112 --> 02:07:21.992]  You own nothing.
[02:07:22.052 --> 02:07:24.214]  You get no right to self-defense.
[02:07:24.234 --> 02:07:25.535]  You have no right to free speech.
[02:07:25.555 --> 02:07:27.617]  You have no right to question your government or media.
[02:07:27.917 --> 02:07:29.458]  You have no freedoms.
[02:07:29.739 --> 02:07:30.439]  You own nothing.
[02:07:30.479 --> 02:07:31.320]  You live in a pod.
[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:32.681]  You're just lucky to even be alive.
[02:07:33.769 --> 02:07:36.530]  You're just lucky to even be alive and getting the bugs to eat.
[02:07:37.190 --> 02:07:39.390]  And the pod to lay in all day and watch Netflix.
[02:07:39.590 --> 02:07:42.871]  This is Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, Larry Fink's planet now.
[02:07:43.531 --> 02:07:45.571]  And you're just a termite here eating their resources.
[02:07:45.951 --> 02:07:53.813]  So they're going to force you to change their behaviors by making your life miserable until you comply with their slave agenda for the whole planet.
[02:07:55.313 --> 02:07:56.754]  Paul Joseph Watson coming up.
[02:07:56.614 --> 02:07:58.614]  I'll be back hosting the war room after that.
[02:07:58.614 --> 02:08:24.614]   Transmitting worldwide from the Summit.News studios in the United Kingdom,
[02:08:24.614 --> 02:08:28.614]  you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:08:28.614 --> 02:08:31.193]  (upbeat music)
[02:08:31.408 --> 02:08:37.790]  We are live, it is the Summit News Hour and in this hour we're going to cover a host of different topics.
[02:08:37.890 --> 02:08:49.259]   Of course we had today a report out of Bloomberg where Joe Biden is set to announce that the US will accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees!
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:58.783]  Now, given that about a third of Ukrainian refugees arriving in countries like France aren't from Ukraine, that might pose a problem.
[02:08:59.463 --> 02:09:07.946]  Now, they've done it, according to the Bloomberg report, at least partially, in the name of protecting the LGBTQ community.
[02:09:09.144 --> 02:09:14.587]  We're going to check in on another report, again in the next segment, which I put up yesterday, on that subject.
[02:09:15.067 --> 02:09:23.752]  Transgenders are fleeing Ukraine because they're getting to the border and basically having their Adam's apples checked by the Ukrainian security forces.
[02:09:24.313 --> 02:09:27.134]  Not a very LGBT-friendly country.
[02:09:27.755 --> 02:09:33.478]  In fact, it's ranked in the bottom ten when it comes to LGBT rights in Ukraine.
[02:09:34.458 --> 02:09:35.559]  Gay marriage is illegal.
[02:09:36.079 --> 02:09:37.280]  Homosexuality is a sin.
[02:09:38.095 --> 02:09:59.891]  So these current thing supporters who have suddenly switched their allegiance from demanding everyone wear a mask and take a vaccine over to supporting Ukraine, many of whom have both the Ukrainian flag in their Twitter bio with the LGBT rainbow flag when they learn about how Ukraine treats gay people and transgenders, they may have a quandary.
[02:10:01.212 --> 02:10:05.883]   Meanwhile, Danish PM says being a refugee is temporary.
[02:10:05.903 --> 02:10:08.366]  We're going to get into all that, but first I want to get into this.
[02:10:09.407 --> 02:10:11.930]  And this is going to take up the next segment as well by the looks of it.
[02:10:12.530 --> 02:10:22.454]   This idea of groupthink, this idea that the flip was switched overnight from the same people who Vitriolically denounced anyone who didn't take a vaccine.
[02:10:22.534 --> 02:10:25.875]  Vitriolically denounced anyone who didn't wear a mask.
[02:10:26.235 --> 02:10:36.260]  The same people now vitriolically denouncing people who don't fully support Ukraine, don't fully support the no-fly zone, the escalation of the war agenda.
[02:10:37.161 --> 02:10:39.102]  Where does that thinking come from?
[02:10:39.162 --> 02:10:41.143]  Well, there were a couple of polls this week.
[02:10:42.363 --> 02:10:43.384]  First one, headline.
[02:10:44.153 --> 02:10:50.375]  Whole vaccinated people far more likely to support risking World War 3 over Ukraine.
[02:10:51.115 --> 02:10:51.895]  Now think about it.
[02:10:51.955 --> 02:10:55.817]  These people for the past two years have been cowering inside their homes.
[02:10:56.157 --> 02:11:00.158]  When they dare leave their homes they've been wearing four or five face masks.
[02:11:00.598 --> 02:11:02.279]  They've had their third jab.
[02:11:02.359 --> 02:11:04.319]  Some of them are now having their fourth jab.
[02:11:04.799 --> 02:11:14.953]   Having lived in abject fear over the past two years of a virus Which 99.7% of people, depending on the age range, survive.
[02:11:15.234 --> 02:11:22.339]  Even in the upper bracket age range, the vast, vast majority survive with no long-term effects whatsoever.
[02:11:22.679 --> 02:11:32.166]  They've been terrified of that virus for the past two years, but now suddenly they're all gung-ho about something which could literally cause nuclear Armageddon.
[02:11:32.958 --> 02:11:46.291]  A new poll finds that vaccinated people are far more likely to risk World War 3 over Ukraine by supporting aggressive measures against Russia, while unvaccinated people are more likely to support diplomatic measures.
[02:11:47.292 --> 02:11:51.757]  This was a survey conducted in Canada, published by the Toronto Star.
[02:11:52.628 --> 02:12:09.014]  There's Canadians who've received three or more shots massively supported expanding sanctions 86% Seizing Russian assets 85% Although now it's come out that Zelensky actually lobbied Roman Abramovich in the United Kingdom to not have his assets seized.
[02:12:09.054 --> 02:12:10.174]  That's interesting, isn't it?
[02:12:10.714 --> 02:12:25.851]   Cutting off shipments of Russian oil 81% and sending additional military equipment to Ukraine 82% Then on the flip side, the unvaccinated, a majority of them, 52%, said they did not support any of that.
[02:12:26.492 --> 02:12:42.583]  So again, this tribal ideological echo chamber has completely transferred over from lockdowns, mask wearing, mass vaccinations with the Covid pandemic, to supporting the current thing in the context of the Ukraine war.
[02:12:42.603 --> 02:12:52.857]   I'm going to get into that further on the other side of the break and then we're going to ask the question, What is the danger of the United States accepting 100,000 Ukrainian refugees?
[02:12:52.917 --> 02:12:54.157]  Summit.News, we'll be back.
[02:12:55.178 --> 02:13:29.746]   And we're back and we're talking about the groupthink that seamlessly transferred over from the Covid lockdown, mask wearing, mass vaccination rhetoric, and again the vitriolic denunciation of anyone who doesn't ideologically bend the knee to that rhetoric, to that narrative, Again I was talking about before the break this new poll out of Canada which shows that there's an exact correlation between the people who supported the vaccination, supported the lockdown, supported the mask wearing and those who want to escalate the conflict in Ukraine.
[02:13:31.846 --> 02:13:34.627]  Chris Menehan comments on this from Information Liberation.
[02:13:35.427 --> 02:13:41.649]  The overwhelming majority probably would have said use diplomacy if it was an option but the war hawks behind the poll left it off the list.
[02:13:42.273 --> 02:13:56.042]  But as I comment, the insightful poll results back up the claims of many that the Covid narrative was switched seamlessly to support Ukraine virtually overnight by the media and the unthinking masses immediately displayed their ideological subservience.
[02:13:56.583 --> 02:14:03.067]  I was walking in a village last week near where I live with probably a population of about 200 people max.
[02:14:04.079 --> 02:14:09.543]  And they advertised a coffee morning for old biddies to support Ukraine.
[02:14:10.063 --> 02:14:23.652]  Like, I'm all for people getting together in the local community, but it's the fact that this is already funneled through to some elderly people in a remote village, that they need to go for a coffee in the morning to support you.
[02:14:23.752 --> 02:14:25.414]  How does that support Ukraine again?
[02:14:25.954 --> 02:14:28.756]  It's just, you could put it on a poster and feel good about yourself.
[02:14:30.129 --> 02:14:42.877]  As I write, NPCs were able to seamlessly transfer from zealous support for vaccines and vitriolic denunciations of anyone who didn't get one, to zealous support for Ukraine and vitriolic denunciations of anyone who didn't fully swallow the war narrative.
[02:14:43.617 --> 02:14:50.281]  It seems that mass support for whatever the current thing the political class and culture demands has become a form of cognitive addiction.
[02:14:51.362 --> 02:14:53.023]  And again, people have made this point.
[02:14:53.996 --> 02:15:12.325]  Because humanity, because people within their own communities have become increasingly atomized from each other, their families are falling apart, they don't talk to their own families, they don't talk to their own parents or siblings, they don't talk to their own neighbors, their life has no definition, no structure, no meaning.
[02:15:13.245 --> 02:15:38.086]   So that meaning is now dependent on them identifying with lurching from one global crisis to another, And then using that, weaponizing that, to give their own life meaning by engaging in this tribalist thinking which allows them to ostracize, publicly shame, deplatform, demonize anyone who isn't on the bandwagon.
[02:15:38.506 --> 02:15:40.007]  People seem to be so lost.
[02:15:41.053 --> 02:15:54.225]  In terms of a lack of fulfillment, a lack of meaning within their own lives, that they glom onto global crises and try to identify with themselves that way, try to define their personality that way.
[02:15:54.685 --> 02:16:20.328]   And in fact that was a point made by, unheard in an article by Mary Harrington, headlined the COVID cautious are hungriest for war, where she talks about this same poll that I just mentioned, And she makes the point that again this atomization of society, this ability to not rely on local threads of your community, has enabled this mass unquestioning thinking.
[02:16:20.408 --> 02:16:34.493]  She writes, quote, humans have probably always clustered by belief to an extent, but it's been evident since at least 2016 that social media greatly accelerates the intensity of this dynamic by unmooring it from material life.
[02:16:35.197 --> 02:16:42.840]  I can't very well cancel my local butcher if we disagree about vaccines or Ukraine, at least not if I want to buy a steak off him tomorrow.
[02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:48.702]  But if I do my grocery shopping online, I can demonise an expel to my heart's content.
[02:16:48.782 --> 02:16:50.943]  So again, because we've become so...
[02:16:52.182 --> 02:17:06.626]  Unreliant on our own community, on the people around us, and we don't necessarily need them anymore, then we can ostracize ourselves from them, not just physically, not just socially, but also in a political sense.
[02:17:07.166 --> 02:17:25.856]   She continues, lockdown scaled this up radically by forcing as much as possible of our common life away from in-person interactions to the internet, which again builds these echo chambers Unsurprisingly, she continues, this has radically intensified ideological clustering and tribalization.
[02:17:25.876 --> 02:17:38.461]  Accordingly, since 2020, we've seen BLM emojis sweep over social media bios, only to replace by, or augmented by, vaccine emojis, and more recently, with an efflorescence of Ukrainian flags.
[02:17:39.542 --> 02:17:42.443]  And in fact, I saw yesterday on Twitter this lawyer.
[02:17:43.343 --> 02:17:54.457]   He posted something like, What would you do if you saw Tommy Robinson and Lawrence Fox in a ditch and you were bypassing a restaurant and the answer was, oh, I'd check what was on the menu?
[02:17:56.078 --> 02:18:02.523]  In his bio, he had the mask emoji, he had the vaccine emoji, and he had the Ukraine flag emoji.
[02:18:02.904 --> 02:18:18.725]   He's very keen on broadcasting what a good person he is to the world, while he simultaneously Brags about how if he saw someone dying in a ditch because they disagree with him politically, he would walk by and let them die.
[02:18:18.745 --> 02:18:22.208]  Because he's a really nice person, he's got the flags in his bio.
[02:18:23.429 --> 02:18:24.770]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:18:25.911 --> 02:18:32.657]  They're the good people, and yet they constantly talk all day about how they want people who disagree with them to die horrible deaths, but they're the good people.
[02:18:33.177 --> 02:18:34.078]  Hans, are we the baddies?
[02:18:35.620 --> 02:18:36.661]  Related story.
[02:18:37.161 --> 02:18:37.541]  Poll.
[02:18:37.641 --> 02:18:43.685]  Support for further US involvement in Ukraine collapses when Americans told it risks war and economic hardship.
[02:18:44.486 --> 02:18:53.932]  Why do you have to be told that if you shoot down Russian planes over Ukraine with NATO jets, that's probably going to lead to World War 3?
[02:18:53.992 --> 02:18:55.113]  How do you not know that?
[02:18:55.718 --> 02:18:57.440]  Russia's said it over and over again.
[02:18:57.960 --> 02:18:59.602]  The UK government said it.
[02:19:00.002 --> 02:19:03.345]  The Biden administration said it multiple times.
[02:19:03.385 --> 02:19:07.189]  That's why they say they're not going to do it, because it's going to lead to nuclear Armageddon.
[02:19:08.250 --> 02:19:19.100]  But when asked in polls if we should give substantial military aid in the form of military equipment to Ukraine, 78% of Americans in this Fox News poll said yes.
[02:19:20.310 --> 02:19:33.320]  But then when you ask them, or when you clarify, when the authority figure, in the form of the pollster, clarifies that that would risk war with Russia, that 78% of Americans collapses to 36%.
[02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:35.762]  But again, why do you need to be told?
[02:19:36.662 --> 02:19:41.206]  Again, this is a complete lack of critical thinking skills within the population.
[02:19:41.446 --> 02:19:45.189]  They can't think one step beyond supporting the current thing.
[02:19:46.110 --> 02:20:02.927]   Similarly, 80% of Americans in this Fox News poll support further economic sanctions against Russia, but this number drops to just 44% when respondents include the proviso that this will lead to, quote, higher prices and financial hardship for Americans.
[02:20:03.867 --> 02:20:19.944]   So again, they can't engage in a modicum of critical thinking to realise that if you slap sanctions on one of the biggest economic powers in the world, one of the biggest Hoarders of energy in the world, Russia, that's going to have a knock-on effect.
[02:20:20.384 --> 02:20:23.185]  It's the breadbasket of Europe in many senses.
[02:20:23.706 --> 02:20:36.692]  That's why people, experts, have said a massive food shortage crisis is coming, food prices are already skyrocketing along with gasoline prices, because that's where a great portion of the food that feeds the world comes from.
[02:20:37.836 --> 02:20:41.519]  So why don't they know that when they answer the initial question?
[02:20:42.039 --> 02:20:43.720]  They support it.
[02:20:44.100 --> 02:20:46.302]  80% of Americans, again, support the economic sanctions.
[02:20:46.622 --> 02:20:51.666]  But when they're told, oh by the way, you know those economic sanctions against energy and food?
[02:20:52.026 --> 02:20:55.889]  That has a knock-on effect to your wallet, to your paycheck.
[02:20:56.309 --> 02:20:56.689]  Oh really?
[02:20:56.709 --> 02:20:57.330]  I didn't know that.
[02:20:57.550 --> 02:20:59.031]  How did you not know that?
[02:20:59.631 --> 02:21:06.376]  They have to be told by a pollster and then support for it collapses by a half or more.
[02:21:07.262 --> 02:21:11.145]  Absolutely incredible, but again it goes back to supporting the current thing.
[02:21:12.146 --> 02:21:17.030]  They support the current thing, they put the Ukraine flag in their Twitter bio, and that's it.
[02:21:17.410 --> 02:21:20.592]  No critical thinking is required beyond that step.
[02:21:21.253 --> 02:21:29.059]  Now people have pushed back, you'll remember Elon Musk posted a meme, which was posted by other people, but he drew massive attention to it.
[02:21:29.499 --> 02:21:32.001]  I support the current thing, this NPC meme.
[02:21:32.641 --> 02:21:42.107]   And people have pushed back against it by saying, The people who say I don't support the current thing are engaging in the exact same mindset.
[02:21:42.992 --> 02:21:44.533]  No, that's completely untrue.
[02:21:44.593 --> 02:21:50.195]  It's not the same thing because supporting the current thing has no negative consequences whatsoever.
[02:21:50.535 --> 02:21:51.916]  You're rewarded with dopamine.
[02:21:52.196 --> 02:21:53.837]  You're rewarded by the establishment.
[02:21:54.057 --> 02:21:55.277]  Your job isn't under threat.
[02:21:55.618 --> 02:22:10.184]  On the flip side, people who don't support the current thing face financial ruin, social ostracization, demonization, deplatforming, as we've seen over the past three or four weeks on numerous occasions once again.
[02:22:10.836 --> 02:22:19.342]  So no, not supporting the current thing isn't the same NPC-like behaviour as I support the current thing, with no critical thinking skills.
[02:22:19.502 --> 02:22:19.983]  We'll be back.
[02:22:20.623 --> 02:22:49.105]   So again, as I mentioned before the break, that number in a Fox News poll, 80% of Americans who support further economic sanctions against Russia, when told that yes, Russia and Ukraine, that area of the world, is the breadbasket for many areas of the world, That Russia controls a lot of energy, a lot of commodities, and that's going to make higher prices in America, that's going to make your food more expensive, your gasoline more expensive.
[02:22:49.525 --> 02:22:57.348]  When told that by an authority figure, the pollster, the support for sanctions on Russia drops by almost a half!
[02:22:57.789 --> 02:23:00.090]  But it's like, how could you not know that?
[02:23:00.730 --> 02:23:02.170]  This is what I'm talking about!
[02:23:02.570 --> 02:23:03.551]  This is that meme!
[02:23:04.682 --> 02:23:06.043]  I support the current thing.
[02:23:06.123 --> 02:23:07.143]  Support the current thing.
[02:23:07.483 --> 02:23:08.424]  Get the dopamine.
[02:23:09.024 --> 02:23:15.567]  Get the high status symbol opinion, which gives you establishment approval, which protects you from being cancelled.
[02:23:16.268 --> 02:23:20.170]  And beyond that, zero critical thinking is required.
[02:23:21.370 --> 02:23:22.571]  Again, I write in the article.
[02:23:23.442 --> 02:23:35.675]  This again underscores how people are so easily manipulated into supporting the current thing based on fleeting feelings of moral superiority and wanting to follow the herd without even considering the long-term consequences.
[02:23:36.676 --> 02:23:38.258]  Again, there was another poll last week.
[02:23:38.298 --> 02:23:38.958]  Same thing.
[02:23:39.799 --> 02:23:41.321]  Yahoo News YouGov poll.
[02:23:41.901 --> 02:23:46.006]  Plurality of Americans supported imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine.
[02:23:46.949 --> 02:23:54.373]  But then opposition to that doubled when respondents were told this would mean the US military shooting down Russian aircraft.
[02:23:55.213 --> 02:23:56.914]  How did you not know that?
[02:23:57.174 --> 02:23:59.855]  That's the very definition of a no-fly zone.
[02:24:00.655 --> 02:24:01.636]  What do you think it is?
[02:24:02.296 --> 02:24:04.097]  Just a kind word in the ear.
[02:24:04.317 --> 02:24:06.418]  Please don't fly any planes over Ukraine.
[02:24:06.838 --> 02:24:10.140]  No, it's shooting down Russian fighters.
[02:24:10.820 --> 02:24:12.281]  It's nuclear Armageddon.
[02:24:12.721 --> 02:24:13.882]  It's World War III.
[02:24:14.342 --> 02:24:15.202]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[02:24:15.442 --> 02:24:16.503]  Yeah, because you can't think.
[02:24:17.918 --> 02:24:19.519]  You support the current thing.
[02:24:20.100 --> 02:24:39.877]  So again, the idea... And by the way, there's a counter-meme now, which is the NPC, and it says, I support... I don't support the current thing, and instead of transgender flags and Ukrainian flags, it's like Infowars and RT in the background, and like, being against masks.
[02:24:41.044 --> 02:24:46.848]  No, that doesn't work, because there's no negative consequences for supporting the current thing.
[02:24:46.868 --> 02:24:53.993]  Whereas if you don't support the current thing, you could end up out of a job, out of a bank account, or even worse!
[02:24:54.774 --> 02:24:56.255]  Another example of that today.
[02:24:57.195 --> 02:25:02.099]  British professor faces government crackdown for questioning Ukraine war narrative.
[02:25:02.539 --> 02:25:06.734]   Again, if he'd just have supported the current thing, He'd have been okay.
[02:25:07.094 --> 02:25:12.055]  Oh, but supporting the current thing and not supporting the current thing, that's ideologically similar.
[02:25:12.155 --> 02:25:16.476]  No, it isn't, because there's no consequence for supporting the current thing.
[02:25:17.196 --> 02:25:22.217]  A professor at the University of Edinburgh is facing trial by media and a government crackdown.
[02:25:22.257 --> 02:25:30.579]  That's literally what the Education Minister said, merely because he shared an article questioning the narrative behind the bombing of a theatre in the Ukrainian city of Maripol.
[02:25:31.388 --> 02:25:44.072]  Now we've had the Snake Island hoax, we've had the Samhaid Ghost of Kiev hoax, we've had the fake bombing of a memorial in Kiev, we've had the fake attack on a nuclear facility.
[02:25:44.612 --> 02:25:52.295]  All complete bollocks never happened, totally contrived by the NATO powers, by the Ukrainian government.
[02:25:53.175 --> 02:25:58.057]  So why should anyone flippantly offhand just believe everything they say?
[02:25:58.982 --> 02:26:23.930]  Professor Tim Hayward is currently being cancelled, cancelled culture doesn't exist though apparently, by the mob because he shared an article by left-wing news outlet Greyzone, which of course also featured in the back of that I don't support the current thing meme by the way, apparently that's a Vobotom website, I'll have to check that one out, which suggested the theatre bombing blamed on Russia may actually have been carried out by Ukraine in as-off fighters.
[02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:25.350]  What, the neo-Nazis?
[02:26:25.430 --> 02:26:28.071]  No, they're our neo-Nazis, they'd never do that.
[02:26:28.962 --> 02:26:33.826]  The incident was immediately exploited by NATO powers to justify more military support for Ukraine.
[02:26:34.707 --> 02:26:41.372]  However, the Neo-Nazi unit is accused of using civilians as human shields inside the building before they blew it up.
[02:26:43.133 --> 02:26:51.500]  And Heywood, this university professor out of Scotland, merely pointed to the fact that there's no evidence of it being blown up by Russian missiles.
[02:26:52.661 --> 02:26:54.302]  Russia has denied attacking it.
[02:26:54.938 --> 02:27:00.279]  People have looked at this theatre building and said it was of no strategic importance, so why would they attack it?
[02:27:00.659 --> 02:27:06.781]  But merely for asking those questions, this professor has been completely savaged.
[02:27:07.361 --> 02:27:09.642]  Again, for not supporting the current thing.
[02:27:10.302 --> 02:27:22.565]  Accused in a Times article of spreading Russian disinformation, which the ghost of Kiev being fake, the Holocaust attack being fake, the Snake Island being fake, that was all Russian disinformation at one time, wasn't it?
[02:27:23.996 --> 02:27:29.539]  He was called a useful idiot for President Putin's atrocities by a Tory MP in the House of Commons.
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:45.249]  The professor was also targeted by Education Secretary, former Vaccines Minister, Nadeem Zahawi, good old British name, who said universities that challenged the official narrative should be investigated and professors punished.
[02:27:46.369 --> 02:27:49.271]  Sounds awful like McCarthyism, doesn't it?
[02:27:50.484 --> 02:27:57.811]  Putin and his cronies are a malign influence on anyone in this country, buying their false narrative, and I have to repeat it, it's a false and dangerous narrative.
[02:27:58.151 --> 02:28:00.653]  We will crack down on it hard, Zahawi said.
[02:28:01.234 --> 02:28:11.903]  Again, he was speaking in the context of this University of Edinburgh professor who merely questioned the official narrative behind this theatre attack.
[02:28:13.362 --> 02:28:16.404]  The professor himself gave a quote to a news outlet.
[02:28:16.424 --> 02:28:19.426]  He said, in war, miscalculations can have terrible consequences.
[02:28:19.966 --> 02:28:29.073]  We also know that misinformation can sometimes even slip through on our own side, as when the UK went to war in Iraq, mistakenly believing it had weapons of mass destruction.
[02:28:29.153 --> 02:28:31.354]  No, we don't talk about that anymore.
[02:28:31.854 --> 02:28:43.102]  We don't talk about how the legacy media, for years, religiously pushed the completely contrived fake story that Al Qaeda terrorists had links to Saddam Hussein and Iraq.
[02:28:43.642 --> 02:28:46.704]  Based on fake, drunken sources.
[02:28:47.804 --> 02:28:49.365]  We don't talk about that anymore, do we?
[02:28:49.645 --> 02:28:49.785]  No.
[02:28:50.886 --> 02:28:57.990]  That's... Again, back in the day that would have been, and it was, I remember, it would have been called Iraqi propaganda.
[02:28:58.130 --> 02:28:59.931]  Turned out to be completely true, of course.
[02:29:00.751 --> 02:29:08.375]  But again, he's facing not only cancellation, he's facing people in Parliament standing up and basically calling him a Russian agent.
[02:29:08.999 --> 02:29:19.143]  I'm calling for him to be not only dismissed, but all universities in the United Kingdom to be investigated for pushing Russian disinformation.
[02:29:19.683 --> 02:29:23.084]  Now, universities in the United Kingdom are pushing a lot of other bad stuff.
[02:29:23.825 --> 02:29:25.185]  Apparently that's fine, though.
[02:29:25.425 --> 02:29:30.007]  You know, schools in the UK are pushing sex lessons for five-year-olds.
[02:29:30.047 --> 02:29:31.227]  Apparently that's permissible.
[02:29:31.548 --> 02:29:32.528]  Don't worry about that.
[02:29:32.828 --> 02:29:35.989]  Some professor questioned an attack in a city in Ukraine.
[02:29:36.449 --> 02:29:37.750]  We have to go after him.
[02:29:39.637 --> 02:29:50.625]  On the flip side we're going to get into this Bashar al-Assad clip because again we have Middle Eastern dictators basically laughing at us and saying what happened to the West triumphing free speech.
[02:29:50.685 --> 02:29:52.486]  That apparently doesn't exist anymore.
[02:29:53.387 --> 02:30:00.452]  And then we're also going to get into this secret plan to send 10,000 NATO peacekeeping troops into Ukraine.
[02:30:00.812 --> 02:30:05.255]  Not so secret given that it's all over the media and Poland has talked about it on numerous occasions.
[02:30:05.942 --> 02:30:11.023]  But Lavrov has shot back and said again that this will trigger direct war with Russia.
[02:30:11.583 --> 02:30:15.224]  But again, as long as it's in furtherance of the current thing, who cares?
[02:30:15.244 --> 02:30:18.465]  Also going to talk about the refugee situation.
[02:30:18.485 --> 02:30:21.806]  100,000 Ukrainian refugees heading to America.
[02:30:22.286 --> 02:30:26.307]  We're going to describe the experiences of female Ukrainian refugees.
[02:30:26.747 --> 02:30:30.830]  Who entered Sweden and then said they want to go back to Ukraine.
[02:30:31.051 --> 02:30:32.212]  Summit.News will be back.
[02:30:32.472 --> 02:30:39.998]  Let's rattle through some of these video clips now because I think we've got about four or five to get through for the next half an hour.
[02:30:40.518 --> 02:30:53.429]  I spoke before the break about this university professor in Scotland being cancelled merely for questioning or sharing a news article which questioned the narrative behind a Russian attack on a theatre in Maripol.
[02:30:54.062 --> 02:31:13.152]  Well now once again we're being lectured in the West by third world dictators about the fact that apparently we've completely abandoned our sanctity for free speech and we're now a laughing stock and we're not distinguished in any way in many senses from many of those autocratic countries in those parts of the world.
[02:31:13.753 --> 02:31:15.774]  This is Assad Bashar al-Assad.
[02:31:16.254 --> 02:31:19.416]  In democratic West you're only allowed one opinion.
[02:31:19.456 --> 02:31:19.936]  Here's the clip.
[02:31:20.680 --> 02:31:26.003]  Petty foreign dictators are once again laughing at the subversion and emasculation of the West.
[02:31:26.123 --> 02:31:28.805]  This time in the form of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
[02:31:28.825 --> 02:31:37.570]  He questioned why the West continues to triumph, how democratic it is, while insisting that everyone holds the exact same opinion about everything.
[02:31:40.919 --> 02:31:47.201]  It's one of the most important things that the West is proud of, but it has fallen into disrepair.
[02:31:47.261 --> 02:31:48.661]  At least since George Bush Jr.
[02:31:48.681 --> 02:31:52.202]  came, about 20 years ago, the entire Western world is in one opinion.
[02:31:52.222 --> 02:31:56.283]  Everyone is moving in the same direction.
[02:31:58.823 --> 02:32:07.004]   Governments, lobbyists, companies, media, and recently, social media.
[02:32:07.004 --> 02:32:11.004]   What is this democratic West where hundreds of millions of people live,
[02:32:11.004 --> 02:32:15.004]  but there is no one opinion?
[02:32:15.004 --> 02:32:19.004]   The truth is that freedom of opinion and freedom of expression is to have one opinion
[02:32:19.004 --> 02:32:22.004]  that is consistent with the West. This is the truth.
[02:32:22.004 --> 02:32:24.004]  Yeah, but isn't Assad just a dictator?
[02:32:24.041 --> 02:32:26.682]  What right does he have to lecture us about free speech?
[02:32:26.842 --> 02:32:28.763]  Yeah, I think you're asking the wrong question.
[02:32:28.783 --> 02:32:35.645]  The real question should be, why are Middle Eastern dictators laughing at the state of free speech in the West?
[02:32:35.705 --> 02:32:42.847]  Does that kind of suggest to you that we've abandoned the principles that once distinguished us from Middle Eastern dictatorship?
[02:32:42.967 --> 02:32:45.910]  Doesn't really matter if Assad is a hypocrite, he's right!
[02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:49.795]  And what of this monoculture of a loud opinion that Assad speaks of?
[02:32:49.895 --> 02:32:53.439]  Is diversity of thought an increasingly endangered concept in the West?
[02:32:53.579 --> 02:32:54.640]  Take this for example.
[02:32:54.780 --> 02:33:02.549]  A polling firm in Canada compared the answers of fully vaccinated people to non-vaccinated people when it came to the situation in Ukraine.
[02:33:02.629 --> 02:33:03.250]  The results?
[02:33:03.610 --> 02:33:04.371]  ...were staggering.
[02:33:04.571 --> 02:33:20.864]  Fully boosted people, having been terrified of a virus for the past two years, are the most aggressive when it comes to favouring risking World War 3 to face down Russia, while non-vaxxed people are far more likely to oppose such measures in favour of diplomacy.
[02:33:20.964 --> 02:33:25.147]  These insightful poll results back up an increasingly common claim.
[02:33:25.187 --> 02:33:36.154]  But when the entire COVID narrative was switched virtually overnight by the media to support Ukraine, the unthinking masses immediately displayed their ideological subservience.
[02:33:36.414 --> 02:33:55.986]  NPCs were able to seamlessly transfer from zealous support for vaccinations and vitriolic denunciations of anyone who didn't get one, to zealous support for Ukraine and vitriolic denunciations of anyone who even dares suggest there might be some nuance, or who doesn't fully swallow the war narrative of the regime.
[02:33:56.106 --> 02:34:04.470]   It seems mass unquestioning support for whatever The current thing the political class and the culture demands has become a form of cognitive addiction.
[02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:20.416]  Having been completely atomised, humanity seems completely dependent on defining itself by lurching from one crisis to another, and weaponising that crisis to ostracise publicly shamed and deplatformed dissidents who suggest that all may not be as it seems.
[02:34:23.047 --> 02:34:31.973]  Now I'm going to move on to this refugee situation in terms of this Biden plan to accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees into the United States.
[02:34:32.634 --> 02:34:36.196]  The exact wording in this Bloomberg article is very interesting.
[02:34:36.677 --> 02:34:46.670]   I'm going to talk about that but first I'm going to play this video because They openly said that they want to help Ukrainian refugees to protect the LGBT movement.
[02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:49.050]  That's basically what this Bloomberg article said.
[02:34:49.070 --> 02:34:56.292]  Which is very interesting because yesterday I made a video about transgenders trying to flee Ukraine.
[02:34:56.332 --> 02:35:06.415]  These are biological males who now claim they're women trying to flee the country, presumably like the Titanic when the men dressed up as women and tried to get on the lifeboats.
[02:35:07.096 --> 02:35:12.782]   Unfortunately for them, Ukraine is not a very LGBT-friendly country.
[02:35:13.202 --> 02:35:14.243]  Let's go to this clip.
[02:35:14.283 --> 02:35:18.206]  Transgenders fleeing Ukraine told their men by border guards.
[02:35:18.306 --> 02:35:18.827]  Here it is.
[02:35:19.608 --> 02:35:26.693]  Transgender women attempting to flee Ukraine are being turned back at the border and told to return home to fight.
[02:35:26.833 --> 02:35:30.776]   The reason, according to Ukrainian border guards, They're men!
[02:35:30.956 --> 02:35:32.457]  Sounds pretty transphobic to me.
[02:35:32.577 --> 02:35:42.463]  Under the state of martial law declared by President Zelensky, all biological males between the ages of 18 and 60 are mandated to stay in the country and fight.
[02:35:42.543 --> 02:35:46.066]  The law makes no exception whatsoever for trans women.
[02:35:46.126 --> 02:35:55.572]   A report by Italian newspaper Le Corriere della Sera confirms that virtually all of the transgenders attempting to escape Ukraine by identifying as Trans women have been apprehended and sent back.
[02:35:55.612 --> 02:36:00.557]  The report quotes one of the trans women who was told by border guards, quote, They are men.
[02:36:00.737 --> 02:36:02.238]  They must turn back and fight.
[02:36:02.338 --> 02:36:09.845]  Another trans women couple, both of whom were born biological males, had their Adam's apples checked by Ukrainian officers.
[02:36:10.706 --> 02:36:13.987]  They were then told to return home and quote, go to the war!
[02:36:14.107 --> 02:36:18.388]  Another described the humiliating treatment meted out by Ukrainian border guards.
[02:36:18.468 --> 02:36:21.808]  Ukrainian border guards undress you and touch you everywhere, Judas says.
[02:36:22.048 --> 02:36:24.709]  You can see on their faces they're wondering, what are you?
[02:36:24.929 --> 02:36:26.589]  Like you're some kind of animal or something.
[02:36:26.709 --> 02:36:34.431]  That from someone who was born a biological female, but now identifies as a man, but was still prevented from fleeing the country.
[02:36:34.571 --> 02:36:40.793]  Legally, there is no reason why she should not be allowed to pass with the thousands of women who are crossing Ukrainian borders to safety every day.
[02:36:41.153 --> 02:36:49.036]  Yet on 12th March at about 4am, after a long and humiliating search, border guards determined she was a man and prevented her passage into Poland.
[02:36:49.136 --> 02:37:00.480]  According to human rights campaigner Alina Shevchenko, it sounds like Ukrainian border guards are preventing even trans people with a valid certificate reflecting their new gender from leaving Ukraine and nobody knows why.
[02:37:00.479 --> 02:37:05.479]   Zero Hedge reports, "Interestingly, the American press didn't pick up the story.
[02:37:05.479 --> 02:37:11.359]   Could this be because it might undermine the bright, shiny, definitely not Nazi-ish, new heroic image of the Ukrainian
[02:37:11.359 --> 02:37:14.729]   government, which has been the subject of almost unanimously positive
[02:37:14.729 --> 02:37:16.479]  coverage in the American press?"
[02:37:16.479 --> 02:37:22.479]   According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, whatever that is,
[02:37:22.479 --> 02:37:29.479]   Ukraine ranks 39 out of 49 European countries when it comes to its treatment of LGBT people.
[02:37:29.723 --> 02:37:36.225]  Gay marriage is illegal and homosexuality is considered a sin, and there are no anti-LGBT discrimination laws.
[02:37:36.345 --> 02:37:46.727]   So technically, all the moral exhibitionists who have put Ukrainian flags in their Twitter bios, Or supporting one of the most homophobic and transphobic countries on the entire continent.
[02:37:46.867 --> 02:37:49.647]  Imagine how scrambled their brains will be when they find that out.
[02:37:49.727 --> 02:37:55.308]  Which current thing do you support when one current thing totally contradicts the other?
[02:37:58.009 --> 02:38:05.950]  Now that's an interesting angle, the fact that these transgenders are being turned back by the apparently transphobic Ukrainian border guards.
[02:38:06.670 --> 02:38:09.331]  But again, we support the current thing, so we'll just ignore that for now.
[02:38:10.123 --> 02:38:28.133]  Because in this Bloomberg article today which announced a Biden White House plan to accept 100,000 refugees into the United States, it said, quote, the official, who is quoted in this Bloomberg article, said the US is committed to protecting LGBTQ people.
[02:38:29.085 --> 02:38:33.188]  And those with medical needs that have been disrupted by war.
[02:38:33.788 --> 02:38:43.915]  Medical needs suggests transgenders, of course LGBTQ people includes those transgenders who are trying to flee the country but being turned back.
[02:38:44.435 --> 02:38:51.520]  So are they literally announcing this 100,000 refugee intake merely to help the rainbow people?
[02:38:52.541 --> 02:38:58.483]   What's also interesting about this, of course, as I've mentioned before, 100,000 Ukrainian refugees.
[02:38:59.043 --> 02:39:04.665]  I will say, many of these Ukrainian refugees are actually refugees, women and children.
[02:39:05.105 --> 02:39:11.348]  Of course, under martial law, Zelensky said men between the ages of 18 and 60 had to stay and fight.
[02:39:11.868 --> 02:39:16.650]  So a lot of the refugees, most of them at least, coming into Europe, are actual refugees.
[02:39:16.690 --> 02:39:17.590]  They're women and children.
[02:39:19.271 --> 02:39:22.332]  The problem is, though, in France, 30% of them aren't.
[02:39:22.492 --> 02:39:24.373]  We had this headline last week.
[02:39:26.222 --> 02:39:39.205]  30% of Ukrainian refugees are actually from other countries, and that was based on a French Le Figaro newspaper report, which said that the newspaper revealed 7.5% are of Algerian nationality.
[02:39:39.365 --> 02:39:40.305]  That's not Ukraine.
[02:39:40.806 --> 02:39:44.767]  3.5% of arrivals are from Ivory Coast and Morocco, respectively.
[02:39:45.227 --> 02:39:52.969]  And then the other countries you look at, Congo, Cameroon, Pakistan, Nigeria, India, they're not coming from Ukraine.
[02:39:52.989 --> 02:39:53.449]  30% at least.
[02:39:56.388 --> 02:40:03.910]  So 100,000 as many as 30,000 will not be actual Ukrainians if it's similar to what's going on in France.
[02:40:04.430 --> 02:40:26.036]   And then of course they had... So as I was talking about before the break, before I got cut off, the US is set to announce a program to accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees in the name of, according to the official quoted by Bloomberg, protecting LGBTQ people And those with medical needs that have been disrupted by war.
[02:40:26.356 --> 02:40:46.085]  So that will include, presumably, the transgenders, biological men who identify as women, attempting to flee Ukraine but being turned back at the border by the transphobic Ukrainian border guards who are checking their Adam's apple and saying they need to go back home and fight on the front lines, basically.
[02:40:46.766 --> 02:40:58.875]   Now another part of this Bloomberg article said, quote, Given that the United States will have to accept these refugees, 100,000, quote, over the course of several years.
[02:40:59.536 --> 02:41:09.225]  Now that's interesting because the Prime Minister of Denmark made the point yesterday that, quote, being a refugee is temporary and that is the headline.
[02:41:09.745 --> 02:41:19.395]   This is Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen Who made the comments after Denmark passed a law giving Ukrainian refugees the right to work, education and social welfare.
[02:41:19.836 --> 02:41:24.718]  But she's basically said, when the war stops, that tap will be turned off.
[02:41:25.358 --> 02:41:30.021]  Quote, being a refugee is temporary, so you have to return and help build up your homeland.
[02:41:30.041 --> 02:41:34.863]  When you get the opportunity, it gives us the opportunity to help other refugees.
[02:41:34.923 --> 02:41:35.804]  And again, that's the point.
[02:41:36.525 --> 02:41:57.137]  When 30% of the quote Ukrainian refugees coming into France aren't Ukrainian refugees, aren't women and children, they're male economic migrants from India, Pakistan and other North African, Middle Eastern countries, that disadvantages actual female and children Ukrainian refugees.
[02:41:58.037 --> 02:42:14.988]   And of course Denmark ...was the first country in Europe to demand that, quote, Syrian refugees, again, many of whom were economic male migrants who came from Afghanistan, Pakistan and all these parts of the world, would have to return home once the Syrian civil war ended.
[02:42:16.684 --> 02:43:04.530]   Then you had this other comment from Denmark's former immigration minister, Inge Stolberg, who said, quote, no one dares to say it like it is, it's because the Ukrainians are more like us, and because they are primarily Christians, as to why European countries such as Poland, which of course accepted virtually zero refugees during the 2015-16 refugee crisis, which was actually exploited by a majority of economic migrants, even they are Swinging open the borders, opening their arms to Ukrainian refugees, because again, the majority of them at least are actual refugees, women and children, but then you have these male economic migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and these other countries which are exploiting that wave once again to slip into the
[02:43:05.390 --> 02:43:06.430]  A continent of Europe.
[02:43:06.830 --> 02:43:11.412]  Now again, on an individual level, the vast majority of them, I don't blame them.
[02:43:11.692 --> 02:43:15.993]  If I lived in a S-hole country in the Middle East, I would want to go to Denmark.
[02:43:16.053 --> 02:43:16.813]  It's pretty nice.
[02:43:17.394 --> 02:43:20.354]  Problem is, we're full and they don't integrate.
[02:43:20.454 --> 02:43:22.135]  And that's the best of the situation.
[02:43:22.415 --> 02:43:29.197]  The worst of the situation is they exploit the refugee wave to carry out mass casualty terrorist attacks.
[02:43:29.853 --> 02:43:50.944]  As happened in Paris where the majority of the Paris jihadists snuck into Europe via the refugee wave and then we had multiple numerous attacks where refugees quote refugees who are actually jihadists exploited that wave to slip into Europe undetected on fake papers to carry out terrorist attacks.
[02:43:50.984 --> 02:43:53.646]  I've talked about that until I was blue in the face.
[02:43:54.386 --> 02:44:12.981]   So yes, there is a danger When you accept a hundred thousand people over a short amount of time and don't vet them properly, which I'm sure the Open Borders Biden administration won't whatsoever, that there's a danger both in terms of security and in terms of integration.
[02:44:13.822 --> 02:44:37.864]   But there's another problem that actual refugees are having coming from Ukraine into supposedly tolerant liberal Western European countries, And that is the problem of multiculturalism and diversity, and that was the unfortunate experience of some female Ukrainian refugees who encountered Swedish multiculturalism, and we have a clip on that, and here it is.
[02:44:39.105 --> 02:44:44.830]  Having escaped the Russian war machine, female Ukrainian refugees are facing a new threat to their safety.
[02:44:44.970 --> 02:44:46.551]  Multicultural Sweden!
[02:44:46.631 --> 02:44:48.212]  Wait, but diversity's a strength, no?
[02:44:48.252 --> 02:44:52.696]  Well, not if you're one of several Ukrainian women staying at a refugee hostel in Orobru.
[02:44:52.716 --> 02:44:59.261]  Speaking to news outlet Samet and Swedish Public Radio, the Ukrainian refugees described what happened.
[02:44:59.461 --> 02:45:07.828]  Gangs of foreign migrants, later identified as Somalis, attempted to break into the hostel rooms where the Ukrainian women were staying with their young children.
[02:45:08.268 --> 02:45:12.794]  This incident occurred at 3am, when two Somali men started knocking on the front door of the hostel.
[02:45:13.134 --> 02:45:16.579]  Without opening the door, the Ukrainian women tried to talk to the men outside.
[02:45:16.619 --> 02:45:21.385]  They looked like African Americans, if I express myself politely, one woman told the news outlet.
[02:45:21.405 --> 02:45:24.129]  They were black people, tall and slim, with black skin colour.
[02:45:24.189 --> 02:45:30.715]  She explained to the men that only Ukrainian women and children live in the hostel, but the Somalis claim that they have a friend who lives there.
[02:45:30.895 --> 02:45:36.441]  After asking what their friend's name was, the Ukrainian women figured out no person with that name was residing at the hostel.
[02:45:36.521 --> 02:45:41.085]  They started knocking on the door of a woman who lives with her two small children, aged two and four.
[02:45:41.325 --> 02:45:44.248]  They were very scared, the volunteer said of the children.
[02:45:44.268 --> 02:45:47.511]  The four-year-old was silent, but the two-year-old screamed, she added.
[02:45:47.631 --> 02:45:54.052]  At 5am, a group reportedly of Arab origin arrived at the premises and attempted unsuccessfully to enter the hostel.
[02:45:54.152 --> 02:45:54.972]  What's the problem?
[02:45:55.012 --> 02:45:57.013]  They were just trying to find their friend!
[02:45:57.873 --> 02:46:00.373]  At 5am, by breaking into a room full of young women.
[02:46:00.453 --> 02:46:02.694]  I'm sure they only had the best intentions.
[02:46:02.874 --> 02:46:09.995]  The women said they were afraid to report what happened to the police and the hostel had to employ a bunch of new security guards.
[02:46:10.235 --> 02:46:15.256]  I don't want to live here because I am afraid, one of the female refugees told Swedish radio.
[02:46:15.516 --> 02:46:19.859]  They said that Sweden was a safe country, but I have not seen that, said another.
[02:46:19.939 --> 02:46:21.520]  Yeah, the media will tell you that.
[02:46:21.561 --> 02:46:29.927]  But the facts will tell you that having been ranked as the safest country in Europe just 20 years ago, Sweden is now the second most dangerous.
[02:46:30.047 --> 02:46:32.328]  Because... diversity's a strength.
[02:46:32.528 --> 02:46:40.694]  If by strength you mean gang rapes, grenade attacks, and no-go zones so dangerous that they don't even deliver the mail there, then yeah, it's really a strength.
[02:46:40.734 --> 02:46:43.256]  Maybe these women can go to Germany instead.
[02:46:43.656 --> 02:46:43.717]  Oh.
[02:46:44.517 --> 02:46:45.978]  Well, maybe not.
[02:46:46.238 --> 02:46:51.562]  A volunteer at the hostel says the women are so terrified they want to go back to Ukraine.
[02:46:51.603 --> 02:47:00.069]  Apparently the threat of missile strikes and bombs raining down on their heads is more appealing than the wondrous benefits of multicultural Sweden.
[02:47:03.512 --> 02:47:13.039]   Now on the same subject of the wondrous benefits of multiculturalism, of course, we had a A sexual grooming scandal in one town alone in the United Kingdom.
[02:47:13.079 --> 02:47:16.641]  It's happened in numerous towns across the country for decades.
[02:47:17.281 --> 02:47:29.628]  That was the town of Rotherham, where for the best part of two decades, young white English girls were industrially groomed and passed around predominantly Muslim Pakistani men.
[02:47:30.248 --> 02:47:31.509]  People complained about it.
[02:47:31.549 --> 02:47:32.729]  They complained to the council.
[02:47:32.769 --> 02:47:34.090]  They complained to the authorities.
[02:47:34.130 --> 02:47:37.132]  They were told to shut up and stop being racist.
[02:47:37.927 --> 02:47:41.993]  Again, this ties into a narrative that I've tried to explain many times over.
[02:47:42.453 --> 02:47:46.158]  Political correctness isn't just being nice to people.
[02:47:46.679 --> 02:47:49.763]  It literally leads to widespread abuse and even death.
[02:47:50.364 --> 02:47:53.468]  We saw the trial of the Manchester Arena bomber.
[02:47:54.810 --> 02:48:07.442]  Back a few months ago where numerous people, before he set off his bombs which killed multiple children at the Manchester Arena in 2017, people were reporting his suspicious activity.
[02:48:07.782 --> 02:48:11.186]  Those people were told to shut up and stop being racist.
[02:48:11.466 --> 02:48:14.148]  Then the bomb went off and 20 odd people died.
[02:48:14.389 --> 02:48:17.532]  Hundreds were maimed and injured because of political correctness.
[02:48:18.092 --> 02:48:25.994]  Breitbart reports, grooming gang whistleblower claims police said she was being racist and quote, rocking the multicultural bone.
[02:48:27.134 --> 02:48:31.915]  Again, this is in Rotherham, town right next door to Sheffield, where I used to live, where I was born.
[02:48:32.255 --> 02:48:40.377]  A child sexual abuse whistleblower has claimed she faced repeated efforts from the police to discourage her from reporting grooming gang activity in Rotherham.
[02:48:41.158 --> 02:48:55.678]   This is Jane Senior, MBE, Who's a key witness in exposing the predominantly Pakistani grooming gang crisis across the north of England, claims to have faced opposition from the police, who allegedly attempted to dissuade her from passing on key evidence.
[02:48:55.758 --> 02:49:08.502]  Remember, in some of these situations, the fathers of the abused children will literally show up at the houses where their kids are being sexually abused, call the police, the police will turn up and say, shut up, you're being racist.
[02:49:08.682 --> 02:49:09.822]  That actually happened.
[02:49:10.963 --> 02:49:28.116]   Continues, The whistleblower, who has made complaints against more than 30 officers, claimed a police misconduct hearing in Sheffield that she was told in one meeting with police officers she was, quote, being racist, was, quote, going against the perpetrator's human rights.
[02:49:28.176 --> 02:49:31.779]  Again, they were passing around and sexually abusing kids.
[02:49:32.475 --> 02:49:34.477]  But their human rights are more important apparently.
[02:49:35.038 --> 02:49:38.041]  And was, quote, rocking the multicultural boat.
[02:49:38.121 --> 02:49:55.449]   So yet more evidence of this grand cover-up that happened in Rotherham happened in numerous other towns and cities throughout the United Kingdom because local councils and local police officers thought it was more important to not be called racist War Room is next.
[02:49:55.469 --> 02:49:56.109]  Summit.News.
[02:49:55.948 --> 02:50:01.627]   and prosecute, to protect the children, and to prosecute the vile individuals who were
[02:50:01.627 --> 02:50:06.867]   involved in this industrial grooming scandal, simply because they were Muslim and they were
[02:50:06.867 --> 02:50:10.108]  brown and those authorities didn't want to be called racist.
[02:50:10.108 --> 02:50:12.667]  Political correctness kills.
[02:50:12.667 --> 02:50:13.667]  War Room is next.
[02:50:13.667 --> 02:50:14.667]  Summit.News.
[02:50:14.667 --> 02:50:16.987]  Don't go away.
[02:50:17.014 --> 02:50:23.517]  I got sued more than 50 times by the Democrats after Trump won, and we knocked out and defeated 46 of them.
[02:50:23.617 --> 02:50:30.101]  And we're down to four of the major lawsuits where Democrats sued us in completely rigged jurisdictions and with rigged courts.
[02:50:30.161 --> 02:50:31.501]  Just unbelievable over the top.
[02:50:31.621 --> 02:50:33.983]  In Connecticut, in New Haven, and in Austin, Texas.
[02:50:34.163 --> 02:50:43.308]  Now, I can sit there and keep battling them with the three Austin trials and one Connecticut trial through October.
[02:50:44.463 --> 02:50:45.003]  of this year.
[02:50:45.524 --> 02:50:46.664]  That's four trials.
[02:50:46.864 --> 02:50:53.588]  They're doing four different lawsuits with the Sandy Hook people, two different law firms, all coordinated, to bankrupt us.
[02:50:54.668 --> 02:51:00.951]  And they know now, because the court's ordering all this stuff that's unconstitutional, our finances, they know there's not extra money there.
[02:51:01.212 --> 02:51:02.652]  And they've told us, we don't care.
[02:51:02.952 --> 02:51:05.434]  We want you to be shut down.
[02:51:05.934 --> 02:51:07.535]  Or you can come out against the Second Amendment.
[02:51:07.555 --> 02:51:08.315]  They've actually told us that.
[02:51:09.056 --> 02:51:09.956]  And I'm not going to do that.
[02:51:10.716 --> 02:51:11.417]  It's very simple.
[02:51:12.515 --> 02:51:22.539]  So, I can go through the kangaroo trials with them, and do all that, and then appeal it, and hold them off another year or two, because their goal is to just come padlock and shut this place down.
[02:51:23.339 --> 02:51:27.541]  Or, we can just boycott their trials, and then they get their $500 million judgments.
[02:51:27.741 --> 02:51:28.521]  That's what they asked for.
[02:51:28.722 --> 02:51:33.283]  They asked the insurance company that Genesis has.
[02:51:33.964 --> 02:51:35.524]  I don't have liability insurance for speech.
[02:51:36.004 --> 02:51:37.565]  They said, we want $590 million.
[02:51:37.645 --> 02:51:38.526]  Excuse me, it's $590 million.
[02:51:38.546 --> 02:51:39.446]  Ted doesn't have $2 million.
[02:51:42.347 --> 02:51:53.414]  Okay, that's how out of control these people are because when you're in a rigged game and know it's all rigged and known that, you know, it's all set up from the beginning with judicial tyranny, you can do stuff like that.
[02:51:53.594 --> 02:51:54.734]  They're not going to shut me up.
[02:51:54.894 --> 02:51:55.955]  I'm not going to be shut down.
[02:51:56.295 --> 02:52:01.959]  They can try to, you know, hurt this operation in this facility, but oh, let me tell you, they're not, they're not going to silence anything.
[02:52:02.659 --> 02:52:10.764]   The point is, is that this crew and this infrastructure and all the reporters And all the things that we do here that's so important needs to continue on.
[02:52:10.785 --> 02:52:12.287]  So I've decided to go ahead and battle it.
[02:52:12.608 --> 02:52:14.011]  And I've decided to go ahead and fight him.
[02:52:14.391 --> 02:52:16.916]  And I've decided to let him have their show trials and all the rest of it.
[02:52:18.712 --> 02:52:25.737]  A judge that says we can't put on evidence because we're already guilty in a default, but we're going to have a jury trial about how guilty I am.
[02:52:26.257 --> 02:52:28.279]  So you're guilty, they just decide how guilty.
[02:52:29.039 --> 02:52:29.800]  Unbelievable.
[02:52:30.060 --> 02:52:30.700]  That's all fine.
[02:52:30.720 --> 02:52:31.461]  We'll let them do it.
[02:52:31.841 --> 02:52:33.923]  Every weapon formed against us will not prosper.
[02:52:34.223 --> 02:52:36.544]  Whatever the devil means for evil, God turns to good.
[02:52:36.885 --> 02:52:37.905]  I've seen this so many times.
[02:52:38.806 --> 02:52:42.370]  We need the funds to go through these four trials.
[02:52:42.850 --> 02:52:45.913]  They want six to eight weeks in Connecticut for their extravaganza.
[02:52:46.394 --> 02:52:48.656]  In Austin, they have BBC and...
[02:52:50.857 --> 02:52:55.642]  HBO and the lawyers primping and the judge primping and coming in all excited.
[02:52:55.762 --> 02:52:56.683]  It's disgusting.
[02:52:56.903 --> 02:52:58.344]  They claim I live off Sandy Hook.
[02:52:58.545 --> 02:53:00.166]  They claim I made money off Sandy Hook.
[02:53:00.487 --> 02:53:02.308]  You know, this Elizabeth Williams writes a book about it.
[02:53:02.328 --> 02:53:03.049]  It's all over the news.
[02:53:03.369 --> 02:53:05.551]  Selling her book saying I made money off Sandy Hook.
[02:53:05.812 --> 02:53:06.773]  Never made money off that.
[02:53:06.793 --> 02:53:07.734]  Barely ever talked about it.
[02:53:08.034 --> 02:53:11.197]  These are a disgusting lot of leeches.
[02:53:11.657 --> 02:53:13.219]  Okay, these media people, these lawyers.
[02:53:13.419 --> 02:53:14.060]  But that's fine.
[02:53:14.320 --> 02:53:15.741]  Everybody sees them for what they are.
[02:53:16.101 --> 02:53:17.262]  Everybody gets what's happening.
[02:53:17.542 --> 02:53:20.064]  It's all turning to crap in their hands.
[02:53:20.605 --> 02:53:22.386]  But I need funds to fight this war.
[02:53:22.926 --> 02:53:23.807]  This information war.
[02:53:23.887 --> 02:53:25.949]  So, it's very simple.
[02:53:26.269 --> 02:53:28.050]  All of our work's coming to a head right now.
[02:53:28.150 --> 02:53:31.993]  Every day we're having major breakthroughs and just doing incredible things.
[02:53:32.033 --> 02:53:32.694]  Thanks for your support.
[02:53:33.476 --> 02:53:35.057]  But I need more capital now than ever.
[02:53:35.097 --> 02:53:37.599]  We had to build our own infrastructure, our own bandwidth, our own everything.
[02:53:38.080 --> 02:53:39.521]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:53:39.721 --> 02:53:46.526]  Go there and that will, by buying the products, pay for the 5, 6, 7, 8 million views a day we get at Man.Video.
[02:53:46.626 --> 02:53:51.490]  And that'll pay for the broadcast here and the infrastructure and all of this that's hurting the New World Order.
[02:53:51.650 --> 02:53:52.851]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:53:52.871 --> 02:53:54.693]  We have up to 75% off right now.
[02:53:55.093 --> 02:53:58.115]  Massive clearance sale to fund this legal defense of this battle.
[02:53:58.275 --> 02:53:59.356]  And we're never going to give up.
[02:53:59.576 --> 02:54:00.477]  We're never going to get it in.
[02:54:00.537 --> 02:54:01.478]  But we could give out.
[02:54:01.879 --> 02:54:05.470]  So we need your financial support now at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:54:05.771 --> 02:54:08.038]  Don't wait and I salute you and thank you all!
